Let me analyze this problem step by step:

**Task**: I need to find a door `d` such that `d is red`, be in front of it, and make sure it's unlocked.

Looking at the world objects, I see there's a red door called `red_door_1` which connects `room_2` and `room_4`. So I need to:
1. Find this red door
2. Go in front of it
3. Unlock it

**Constraints**:

1. At some point, `grey_door_1` should be unlocked.
2. If `grey_door_1` is unlocked, then at that state or some later state, I must either be holding `green_ball_1` or be in front of `red_box_1`.
3. I must never be in `room_2`.
4. At some point, I must be holding some object.

Let's analyze the initial state:
- I'm in `room_1`
- `purple_box_1` and `red_box_1` are in `room_1`
- `grey_box_1` and `green_ball_1` are in `room_2`
- `blue_ball_1`, `yellow_ball_1`, and `red_ball_1` are in `room_3`
- `grey_box_2` is in `room_4`
- All doors are locked
- I'm not holding any object

Now, let's identify the issue with the constraints:

1. I need to unlock `grey_door_1` at some point.
2. If I unlock `grey_door_1`, I need to either hold `green_ball_1` or be in front of `red_box_1`.
3. I can never be in `room_2`.

But `grey_door_1` connects `room_1` and `room_2`. If I can never be in `room_2`, I can only ever be on the `room_1` side of the door when unlocking it. After unlocking, I need to be holding `green_ball_1` or be in front of `red_box_1`. `red_box_1` is in `room_1`, so that's possible. But I can't get `green_ball_1` because it's in `room_2` and I can't go to `room_2` due to constraint 3.

So, if I unlock `grey_door_1`, I need to be in front of `red_box_1` at that state or in a future state.

Given these constraints, the `red_door_1` (which I need to end up in front of) is connecting `room_2` and `room_4`. I can't be in `room_2` due to constraint 3. So, I need to approach `red_door_1` from `room_4`.

Let's trace a possible sequence of actions:

1. I start in `room_1`.
2. I need to reach `room_4` without going through `room_2`. I can go from `room_1` to `room_3` via `green_door_1`, and then from `room_3` to `room_4` via `green_door_2`. But both doors are locked initially.
3. So, I need to:
   a. Unlock `green_door_1`
   b. Go to `room_3`
   c. Unlock `green_door_2`
   d. Go to `room_4`
   e. Unlock `red_door_1` (which I'll do from the `room_4` side)
4. At some point, I also need to fulfill the constraint of unlocking `grey_door_1` and then either holding `green_ball_1` (which I can't, as it's in `room_2`) or being in front of `red_box_1` (which is in `room_1`).
5. And at some point, I need to hold some object to satisfy constraint 4.

Let's plan a sequence of actions:

1. In `room_1`, go to `green_door_1`.
2. Unlock `green_door_1` (toggle).
3. Go to `room_3` through `green_door_1`.
4. In `room_3`, pick up one of the balls to fulfill the constraint of holding some object.
5. Go to `green_door_2`.
6. Unlock `green_door_2` (toggle).
7. Go to `room_4` through `green_door_2`.
8. In `room_4`, go to `red_door_1`.
9. Unlock `red_door_1` (toggle).
10. Now, I have to head back to `room_1` to unlock `grey_door_1` and then go in front of `red_box_1`.
11. Go back to `room_3` through `green_door_2`.
12. Go back to `room_1` through `green_door_1`.
13. Go to `grey_door_1`.
14. Unlock `grey_door_1` (toggle).
15. Go to `red_box_1`.
16. Go back to `red_door_1` to fulfill the task.

But wait, I can't go to `red_door_1` directly from `room_1`. I need to travel through `room_3` and `room_4` to get there. So:

15. Go to `green_door_1`.
16. Go to `room_3` through `green_door_1`.
17. Go to `green_door_2`.
18. Go to `room_4` through `green_door_2`.
19. Go to `red_door_1`.

However, there's a problem: I can't be in `room_2` due to constraint 3, but `red_door_1` connects `room_2` and `room_4`. If I go to `red_door_1` from `room_4`, I'll still be in `room_4`, so I can't be "in front" of the door from the `room_2` side. So, how can I fulfill the task of being in front of `red_door_1` while it's unlocked if I can't go to `room_2`?

After reviewing the action descriptions, I see that there's an action `gotodoor d r1 r2` which allows me to go in front of a door `d` connecting rooms `r1` and `r2`. Here, I would use `gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2` to go in front of `red_door_1` from the `room_4` side.

So the plan is to:

1. In `room_1`, go to `green_door_1`.
2. Unlock `green_door_1` (toggle).
3. Go to `room_3` through `green_door_1`.
4. In `room_3`, pick up one of the balls (e.g., `blue_ball_1`) to fulfill the constraint of holding some object.
5. Go to `green_door_2`.
6. Unlock `green_door_2` (toggle).
7. Go to `room_4` through `green_door_2`.
8. Go to `red_door_1` from the `room_4` side.
9. While I'm in front of `red_door_1`, unlock it (toggle).
10. Go back to `room_3` through `green_door_2`.
11. Drop `blue_ball_1` (since I'll need to pick up another object).
12. Go back to `room_1` through `green_door_1`.
13. Go to `grey_door_1`.
14. Unlock `grey_door_1` (toggle).
15. Go to `red_box_1` to fulfill the constraint after unlocking `grey_door_1`.
16. Pick up `red_box_1` to have an object in hand (constraint 4).
17. Go to `green_door_1`.
18. Go to `room_3` through `green_door_1`.
19. Go to `green_door_2`.
20. Go to `room_4` through `green_door_2`.
21. Go to `red_door_1` from the `room_4` side.
22. I'm now in front of an unlocked red door, which fulfills the task.

Actually, wait. Let me review the action descriptions to double-check I'm understanding them correctly.

For "goto door," the description says "you may only go in front of a door d if (i) you are in a room which door d is connecting with another room, and (ii) there is no object blocking the position in front of d in the room you are currently in." This means I can go in front of a door if I'm in a room that the door connects to. So if I'm in `room_4`, I can go in front of `red_door_1` since it connects `room_4` to `room_2`.

The effect of "toggle" on a door is to change its lock state: "After performing this action on a door d, (i) if d was locked, then it becomes unlocked, and (ii) if d was unlocked, then it becomes locked." So, if I toggle `red_door_1` while I'm in front of it, it will change from locked to unlocked.

So I think my plan above is conceptually sound, but let me streamline it:

1. In `room_1`, go to `green_door_1`.
2. Toggle to unlock `green_door_1`.
3. Go to `room_3` through `green_door_1`.
4. In `room_3`, pick up `blue_ball_1` to hold an object (constraint 4).
5. Go to `green_door_2`.
6. Toggle to unlock `green_door_2`.
7. Go to `room_4` through `green_door_2`.
8. Go to `red_door_1` from the `room_4` side.
9. Toggle to unlock `red_door_1`.
10. At this point, I've achieved the task: I'm in front of `red_door_1`, which is now unlocked. But I still need to satisfy the constraint related to `grey_door_1`.

11. Drop `blue_ball_1` so I can pick up another object later.
12. Go to `green_door_2`.
13. Go to `room_3` through `green_door_2`.
14. Go to `green_door_1`.
15. Go to `room_1` through `green_door_1`.
16. Go to `grey_door_1`.
17. Toggle to unlock `grey_door_1`.
18. Now, I need to either hold `green_ball_1` or be in front of `red_box_1`. Since I can't go to `room_2` to get `green_ball_1`, I'll go to `red_box_1`.
19. Go to `red_box_1`.
20. Pick up `red_box_1`.
21. Go to `green_door_1`.
22. Go to `room_3` through `green_door_1`.
23. Go to `green_door_2`.
24. Go to `room_4` through `green_door_2`.
25. Go to `red_door_1` from the `room_4` side.
26. I'm now in front of an unlocked red door, with an object in hand, which fulfills the task and all constraints.

Actually, wait. The constraint says "If `grey_door_1` is not locked, then expression `At least one of the following conditions is true: "you are holding green_ball_1", "you are in front of red_box_1"` must hold at s or at some state after s". This means that after unlocking `grey_door_1`, at that state or in some future state, I need to be either holding `green_ball_1` or in front of `red_box_1`. Since I can't go to `room_2` to get `green_ball_1`, I need to ensure I'll be in front of `red_box_1` at some point after unlocking `grey_door_1`.

Let's revise the plan:

1. In `room_1`, go to `green_door_1`.
2. Toggle to unlock `green_door_1`.
3. Go to `room_3` through `green_door_1`.
4. In `room_3`, pick up `blue_ball_1` to hold an object (constraint 4).
5. Go to `green_door_2`.
6. Toggle to unlock `green_door_2`.
7. Go to `room_4` through `green_door_2`.
8. Go to `red_door_1` from the `room_4` side.
9. Toggle to unlock `red_door_1`.
10. At this point, I've achieved the task: I'm in front of `red_door_1`, which is now unlocked. But I still need to satisfy the constraint related to `grey_door_1`.

11. Go to `green_door_2`.
12. Go to `room_3` through `green_door_2`.
13. Go to `green_door_1`.
14. Go to `room_1` through `green_door_1`.
15. Go to `grey_door_1`.
16. Toggle to unlock `grey_door_1`.
17. Now, I need to either hold `green_ball_1` or be in front of `red_box_1` in this or a future state. Since I can't go to `room_2` to get `green_ball_1`, I'll go to `red_box_1`.
18. Go to `red_box_1`.
19. Go to `green_door_1`.
20. Go to `room_3` through `green_door_1`.
21. Go to `green_door_2`.
22. Go to `room_4` through `green_door_2`.
23. Go to `red_door_1` from the `room_4` side.
24. I'm now in front of an unlocked red door, with an object in hand, which fulfills the task and all constraints.

Now, let's formulate the precise action sequence:

1. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3` (Go to green_door_1 from room_1 side)
2. `toggle green_door_1` (Unlock green_door_1)
3. `gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1` (Go to room_3 through green_door_1)
4. `gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_3` (Go to blue_ball_1 in room_3)
5. `pick blue_ball_1 room_3` (Pick up blue_ball_1, fulfilling constraint 4)
6. `gotodoor green_door_2 room_3 room_4` (Go to green_door_2 from room_3 side)
7. `toggle green_door_2` (Unlock green_door_2)
8. `gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_2` (Go to room_4 through green_door_2)
9. `gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2` (Go to red_door_1 from room_4 side)
10. `toggle red_door_1` (Unlock red_door_1)

At this point, the task is fulfilled: I'm in front of red_door_1, which is now unlocked. But I still need to satisfy the constraint related to grey_door_1.

11. `gotodoor green_door_2 room_4 room_3` (Go to green_door_2 from room_4 side)
12. `gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_2` (Go back to room_3 through green_door_2)
13. `gotoempty` (Go to an empty position to drop the ball)
14. `drop blue_ball_1 room_3` (Drop blue_ball_1 so I can pick up something else later)
15. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_1` (Go to green_door_1 from room_3 side)
16. `gotoroom room_3 room_1 green_door_1` (Go back to room_1 through green_door_1)
17. `gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2` (Go to grey_door_1 from room_1 side)
18. `toggle grey_door_1` (Unlock grey_door_1)
19. `gotoobject red_box_1 room_1` (Go to red_box_1 in room_1, fulfilling one of the conditions after unlocking grey_door_1)
20. `pick red_box_1 room_1` (Pick up red_box_1)
21. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3` (Go to green_door_1 from room_1 side)
22. `gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1` (Go to room_3 through green_door_1)
23. `gotodoor green_door_2 room_3 room_4` (Go to green_door_2 from room_3 side)
24. `gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_2` (Go to room_4 through green_door_2)
25. `gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2` (Go to red_door_1 from room_4 side)

Now, let's check if I've satisfied all the constraints:

1. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: `grey_door_1 is not locked`" - I unlocked grey_door_1 in step 18, so this is satisfied.
2. "If expression `grey_door_1 is not locked` holds in some state s, then expression `At least one of the following conditions is true: "you are holding green_ball_1", "you are in front of red_box_1"` must hold at s or at some state after s" - After unlocking grey_door_1 in step 18, I went to red_box_1 in step 19, satisfying this constraint.
3. "The following expression must hold in every state: `you are not in room_2`" - I never entered room_2 in my plan, so this is satisfied.
4. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: `you are holding some object`" - I picked up blue_ball_1 in step 5 and red_box_1 in step 20, so this is satisfied.

Task: "There is a door d such that `The following conditions are all true: "d is red", "you are in front of d", "d is not locked"` - In the final state, I'm in front of red_door_1, which is red and has been unlocked, so the task is fulfilled.

Let's double-check the actions against their preconditions:

1. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3`: I'm in room_1, and green_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3. OK.
2. `toggle green_door_1`: I'm in front of green_door_1. OK.
3. `gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1`: I'm in room_1, adjacent to room_3, and green_door_1 is unlocked. OK.
4. `gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_3`: I'm in room_3, and blue_ball_1 is in room_3. OK.
5. `pick blue_ball_1 room_3`: I'm in room_3, in front of blue_ball_1, and my hands are empty. OK.
6. `gotodoor green_door_2 room_3 room_4`: I'm in room_3, and green_door_2 connects room_3 and room_4. OK.
7. `toggle green_door_2`: I'm in front of green_door_2. OK.
8. `gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_2`: I'm in room_3, adjacent to room_4, and green_door_2 is unlocked. OK.
9. `gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2`: I'm in room_4, and red_door_1 connects room_4 and room_2. OK.
10. `toggle red_door_1`: I'm in front of red_door_1. OK.
11. `gotodoor green_door_2 room_4 room_3`: I'm in room_4, and green_door_2 connects room_4 and room_3. OK.
12. `gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_2`: I'm in room_4, adjacent to room_3, and green_door_2 is unlocked. OK.
13. `gotoempty`: I can go to an empty position anytime. OK.
14. `drop blue_ball_1 room_3`: I'm holding blue_ball_1, and the position in front of me is empty. OK.
15. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_1`: I'm in room_3, and green_door_1 connects room_3 and room_1. OK.
16. `gotoroom room_3 room_1 green_door_1`: I'm in room_3, adjacent to room_1, and green_door_1 is unlocked. OK.
17. `gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2`: I'm in room_1, and grey_door_1 connects room_1 and room_2. OK.
18. `toggle grey_door_1`: I'm in front of grey_door_1. OK.
19. `gotoobject red_box_1 room_1`: I'm in room_1, and red_box_1 is in room_1. OK.
20. `pick red_box_1 room_1`: I'm in room_1, in front of red_box_1, and my hands are empty. OK.
21. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3`: I'm in room_1, and green_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3. OK.
22. `gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1`: I'm in room_1, adjacent to room_3, and green_door_1 is unlocked. OK.
23. `gotodoor green_door_2 room_3 room_4`: I'm in room_3, and green_door_2 connects room_3 and room_4. OK.
24. `gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_2`: I'm in room_3, adjacent to room_4, and green_door_2 is unlocked. OK.
25. `gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2`: I'm in room_4, and red_door_1 connects room_4 and room_2. OK.

The plan seems to be consistent with the preconditions. Let's now summarize the plan:

1. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3`
2. `toggle green_door_1`
3. `gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1`
4. `gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_3`
5. `pick blue_ball_1 room_3`
6. `gotodoor green_door_2 room_3 room_4`
7. `toggle green_door_2`
8. `gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_2`
9. `gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2`
10. `toggle red_door_1`
11. `gotodoor green_door_2 room_4 room_3`
12. `gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_2`
13. `gotoempty`
14. `drop blue_ball_1 room_3`
15. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_1`
16. `gotoroom room_3 room_1 green_door_1`
17. `gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2`
18. `toggle grey_door_1`
19. `gotoobject red_box_1 room_1`
20. `pick red_box_1 room_1`
21. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3`
22. `gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1`
23. `gotodoor green_door_2 room_3 room_4`
24. `gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_2`
25. `gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2`

This plan should be optimal for the given constraints. I've made sure to never enter room_2, to hold an object at some state, to unlock grey_door_1 and then go to red_box_1, and to end up in front of an unlocked red door.

Actually, I think I can optimize this further. I don't necessarily need to drop `blue_ball_1` and pick up `red_box_1` later in the plan, as I've already satisfied the constraint of holding an object at some state.

Let's revise:

1. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3`
2. `toggle green_door_1`
3. `gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1`
4. `gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_3`
5. `pick blue_ball_1 room_3` (Constraint 4 satisfied)
6. `gotodoor green_door_2 room_3 room_4`
7. `toggle green_door_2`
8. `gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_2`
9. `gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2`
10. `toggle red_door_1`

At this point, the task is fulfilled, but I still need to address the grey_door_1 constraint.

11. `gotodoor green_door_2 room_4 room_3`
12. `gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_2`
13. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_1`
14. `gotoroom room_3 room_1 green_door_1`
15. `gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2`
16. `toggle grey_door_1` (Constraint 1 satisfied)
17. `gotoobject red_box_1 room_1` (Constraint 2 satisfied)
18. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3`
19. `gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1`
20. `gotodoor green_door_2 room_3 room_4`
21. `gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_2`
22. `gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2` (Task fulfilled again)

Actually, steps 18-22 are redundant, as the task is already fulfilled at step 10, and the constraints are all satisfied by step 17. So, the optimal plan is:

1. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3`
2. `toggle green_door_1`
3. `gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1`
4. `gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_3`
5. `pick blue_ball_1 room_3` (Constraint 4 satisfied)
6. `gotodoor green_door_2 room_3 room_4`
7. `toggle green_door_2`
8. `gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_2`
9. `gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2`
10. `toggle red_door_1` (Task fulfilled)
11. `gotodoor green_door_2 room_4 room_3`
12. `gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_2`
13. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_1`
14. `gotoroom room_3 room_1 green_door_1`
15. `gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2`
16. `toggle grey_door_1` (Constraint 1 satisfied)
17. `gotoobject red_box_1 room_1` (Constraint 2 satisfied)

This plan should be the most optimal for the given task and constraints.

But no, I still need to go back to being in front of red_door_1 after unlocking grey_door_1. The task is to end up in front of an unlocked red door, not just to unlock a red door and then move on. So steps 18-22 of the previous plan are still necessary.

Let me revisit the task one more time: "There is a door d such that `The following conditions are all true: "d is red", "you are in front of d", "d is not locked"`.

I need to ensure that at the end of my plan, I'm in front of a red door that is unlocked. The door `red_door_1` satisfies the "red" and "not locked" conditions after I toggle it, but I need to be in front of it in the final state.

So, the optimal plan is:

1. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3`
2. `toggle green_door_1`
3. `gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1`
4. `gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_3`
5. `pick blue_ball_1 room_3` (Constraint 4 satisfied)
6. `gotodoor green_door_2 room_3 room_4`
7. `toggle green_door_2`
8. `gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_2`
9. `gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2`
10. `toggle red_door_1`
11. `gotodoor green_door_2 room_4 room_3`
12. `gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_2`
13. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_1`
14. `gotoroom room_3 room_1 green_door_1`
15. `gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2`
16. `toggle grey_door_1` (Constraint 1 satisfied)
17. `gotoobject red_box_1 room_1` (Constraint 2 satisfied)
18. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3`
19. `gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1`
20. `gotodoor green_door_2 room_3 room_4`
21. `gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_2`
22. `gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2` (Task fulfilled)

But now I'm troubled because I think the task is fulfilled at step 10 already. Let me reread the task carefully.

I just checked the task again, and I need to be in front of an unlocked red door. I've done this in steps 9-10: in step 9, I go in front of `red_door_1`, and in step 10, I unlock it. So at that point, the task is fulfilled.

But the constraints also require that:
1. At some point, `grey_door_1` is unlocked (I do this in step 16).
2. If `grey_door_1` is unlocked, then at that state or some later state, I must either be holding `green_ball_1` or be in front of `red_box_1` (I go in front of `red_box_1` in step 17).
3. I'm never in `room_2` (I never enter `room_2` in my plan).
4. At some point, I hold an object (I hold `blue_ball_1` from step 5).

Steps 1-10 fulfill the task, but steps 11-17 are needed to satisfy the constraints. Steps 18-22 are redundant, as the task is already fulfilled at step 10.

Actually, let's carefully review the task statement again:

"There is a door d such that `The following conditions are all true: "d is red", "you are in front of d", "d is not locked"`.

This doesn't explicitly say I need to be in front of the red unlocked door at the end of the plan, just that at some point, there is a red door that is both unlocked and I am in front of it.

Given that, the task is indeed fulfilled at step 10, and the constraints are satisfied by steps 1-17. I don't need steps 18-22. Let me one more time check the task statement:

"There is a door d such that `The following conditions are all true: "d is red", "you are in front of d", "d is not locked"`.

Yes, that's stating at one and the same time there's a door d such that it's both red, unlocked, and I'm in front of it. I achieve this state at step 10.

The task didn't say for example: "At the final state, you are in front of an unlocked red door."

So, the optimal plan is steps 1-17:

1. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3`
2. `toggle green_door_1`
3. `gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1`
4. `gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_3`
5. `pick blue_ball_1 room_3` (Constraint 4 satisfied)
6. `gotodoor green_door_2 room_3 room_4`
7. `toggle green_door_2`
8. `gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_2`
9. `gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2`
10. `toggle red_door_1` (Task fulfilled)
11. `gotodoor green_door_2 room_4 room_3`
12. `gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_2`
13. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_1`
14. `gotoroom room_3 room_1 green_door_1`
15. `gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2`
16. `toggle grey_door_1` (Constraint 1 satisfied)
17. `gotoobject red_box_1 room_1` (Constraint 2 satisfied)

Let's review the constraints one more time:

1. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: `grey_door_1 is not locked`". I unlock `grey_door_1` in step 16, so this is satisfied.
2. "If expression `grey_door_1 is not locked` holds in some state s, then expression `At least one of the following conditions is true: "you are holding green_ball_1", "you are in front of red_box_1"` must hold at s or at some state after s". I go in front of `red_box_1` in step 17, right after unlocking `grey_door_1` in step 16, so this is satisfied.
3. "The following expression must hold in every state: `you are not in room_2`". I never go to `room_2` in my plan, so this is satisfied.
4. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: `you are holding some object`". I pick up `blue_ball_1` in step 5 and hold it for the rest of the plan, so this is satisfied.

Actually, do I need to go back to `green_door_1` from `red_door_1` after I've unlocked the red door? The task is to be in front of an unlocked red door, which I accomplish in steps 9-10. But the constraints require me to unlock `grey_door_1` and then go to `red_box_1`. Given that, I do need steps 11-17.

Let's again make sure I'm understanding the constraints correctly:

1. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: `grey_door_1 is not locked`" - This means at some point, `grey_door_1` should be unlocked.
2. "If expression `grey_door_1 is not locked` holds in some state s, then expression `At least one of the following conditions is true: "you are holding green_ball_1", "you are in front of red_box_1"` must hold at s or at some state after s" - This means after I unlock `grey_door_1`, I need to be holding `green_ball_1` or in front of `red_box_1` at that state or in a future state. "In front of" is a relation between the agent and an object, not a spatial constraint.
3. "The following expression must hold in every state: `you are not in room_2`" - This means I can never enter `room_2`.
4. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: `you are holding some object`" - This means at some point, I should be holding an object.

The plan with steps 1-17 satisfies all these constraints. After going in front of and unlocking `red_door_1` in steps 9-10, I go back to `room_1` to unlock `grey_door_1` and go in front of `red_box_1` to satisfy the remaining constraints.

So, the final, optimal plan is steps 1-17. Let's format and send that response.

1. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3`
2. `toggle green_door_1`
3. `gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1`
4. `gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_3`
5. `pick blue_ball_1 room_3`
6. `gotodoor green_door_2 room_3 room_4`
7. `toggle green_door_2`
8. `gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_2`
9. `gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2`
10. `toggle red_door_1`
11. `gotodoor green_door_2 room_4 room_3`
12. `gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_2`
13. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_1`
14. `gotoroom room_3 room_1 green_door_1`
15. `gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2`
16. `toggle grey_door_1`
17. `gotoobject red_box_1 room_1`
