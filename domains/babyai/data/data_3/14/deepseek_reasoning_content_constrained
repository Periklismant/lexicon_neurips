Okay, let's try to figure out how to solve this planning problem. So the goal is to have a yellow ball that I'm holding. The initial state is that I'm in room_2, not holding anything. Let's look at the objects and their locations.

First, the yellow balls are in room_2 (yellow_ball_1), room_3 (yellow_ball_2), and room_4 (yellow_ball_3 and yellow_ball_4). The closest one is in room_2, but maybe I can pick that up directly. Wait, but let's check the constraints.

Constraints:
1. At some point, I must be holding an object. Well, the goal requires that, so that's covered.
2. Whenever I'm holding an object, either I'm in room_4 or yellow_door_1 is unlocked. Hmm. So if I pick up a ball in room_2, then in that state, I need to make sure that either I'm in room_4 (but I'm not, I'm in room_2) or yellow_door_1 is unlocked. But yellow_door_1 is initially locked. So after picking up the ball in room_2, I have to unlock yellow_door_1 at some point. Or maybe move to room_4 before picking it up? But how?

Wait, maybe the plan requires that after picking up the object, I either go to room_4 or unlock yellow_door_1. Let's see. Let's suppose I pick up yellow_ball_1 in room_2. Then, in the state where I'm holding it, I need to ensure that either I'm in room_4 or yellow_door_1 is unlocked. But since I'm in room_2, I need to unlock yellow_door_1. But to unlock a door, I have to toggle it, which requires being in front of it. So first, I need to go to the door, toggle it, then pick up the ball. Wait, but if I unlock the door after picking up the ball, does that satisfy the constraint? Because the constraint says that if in a state s I'm holding an object, then either in s or some state after s, either I'm in room_4 or yellow_door_1 is not locked. So if I pick up the ball in room_2, then later unlock the door, that would satisfy the constraint. But the problem is that after picking up the ball, I need to do something that eventually meets the condition. So maybe that's possible.

But wait, the constraints also require that in at least one state, I'm in room_4. So I have to go to room_4 at some point. Also, another constraint requires that in at least one state, either empty is in room_1 (which I think refers to the empty_0 object) or I'm holding blue_box_1. But blue_box_1 is in room_1. So maybe I need to go to room_1 and pick up blue_box_1, or just have empty in room_1. Wait, the empty_0 is a special object? Or does "empty is in room_1" mean that there's an empty position in room_1? The problem statement says that empty_0 is an object of type empty. Maybe the condition is that the empty_0 object is in room_1. But in the initial state, empty_0's location isn't specified. Wait, maybe the condition is that there's an empty spot in room_1, but the way it's phrased is "empty is in room_1". Hmm. This is a bit unclear. Let me check the initial state. The original state doesn't mention empty_0's location, but perhaps "empty is in room_1" refers to having an empty position there, which is always true unless all positions are filled. Since rooms can have multiple objects, maybe that condition is trivially true. Wait, the problem says "rooms may include two types of objects: boxes and balls". So each room has positions where objects can be, but there are empty positions. So "empty is in room_1" would always be true, because there's at least one empty position. But maybe the initial state has some objects in room_1. Let's see: in the initial state, blue_box_1 is in room_1. So room_1 has a box. So unless all positions are filled, there's an empty position. Since the problem doesn't state that any room is full, I think "empty is in room_1" is always true. Therefore, the constraint "At least one of the following conditions is true: 'empty is in room_1', 'you are holding blue_box_1'" is automatically satisfied by the first condition, because there's always an empty spot in room_1. So maybe that constraint is already satisfied, so we don't need to worry about it. But perhaps I need to confirm. If that's the case, then the fourth constraint is always true, so we can ignore it. But let's proceed.

So the main steps are:

1. Get a yellow ball into my hand.

Possible options:

- Pick up yellow_ball_1 in room_2.

But after that, the constraint says that in the state where I'm holding it, either I'm in room_4 or yellow_door_1 is unlocked. Since I'm in room_2, I need to unlock yellow_door_1 eventually. But unlocking it would require going to the door, which is in room_2 and room_1. But yellow_door_1 connects room_1 and room_2. So to toggle it, I need to be in front of it. So in room_2, I can go to yellow_door_1, toggle it to unlock, then pick up the ball. Wait, but the order matters. If I first unlock yellow_door_1, then pick up the ball, then in the state where I'm holding the ball, yellow_door_1 is unlocked. So that would satisfy the constraint. Let's outline:

- gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2 (but wait, the action is "gotoobject x r", so yes.)

Wait, the actions require that to goto an object, I must be in the same room. So since I'm in room_2, and yellow_ball_1 is in room_2, I can go to it.

Then pick it up.

But before that, I need to unlock the yellow_door_1. Because after picking up the ball, the constraint requires that in that state or later, yellow_door_1 is unlocked or I'm in room_4. But if I unlock it before picking up the ball, then when I pick up the ball, the door is already unlocked, so the constraint is satisfied.

Alternatively, perhaps I can unlock the door after picking up the ball. Let's think. Suppose I pick up the ball first. Then, in the state where I'm holding it, the door is still locked. So I need to unlock it after that. But to unlock it, I need to be in front of the door. But I can't go to the door if I'm holding an object, because to go to the door, I need to move. Wait, but after picking up the ball, I'm holding it. To go to the door, I need to use "gotodoor", which requires that there's no object blocking the position in front of the door. But if the door is blocked, I can't go there. However, in the initial state, are any objects blocking the doors? The initial state doesn't mention any objects blocking doors, except that when you drop an object, it might block a door. But initially, the objects are in their rooms. So maybe the doors are not blocked. Let me check the initial state. The initial state lists objects in rooms, but not their positions relative to doors. So perhaps the doors are not blocked. Therefore, after picking up the ball, I can go to the door (yellow_door_1) in room_2, toggle it (unlock), which would satisfy the constraint.

Wait, but when you pick up an object, the effect is that you're no longer in front of it. So after picking up yellow_ball_1, I'm not in front of anything. Then, to toggle the door, I need to be in front of it. So the steps would be:

1. gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2

2. pick yellow_ball_1 room_2

3. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_1 (since the door connects room_2 and room_1, and I'm in room_2)

4. toggle yellow_door_1

But after step 2, I'm holding the ball. Then step 3 requires going to the door. But to go to the door, the preconditions are that I'm in a room connected by the door (room_2 is connected via yellow_door_1 to room_1), and there's no object blocking the position. Assuming that's possible. Then after step 4, the door is unlocked. So the constraint is satisfied because in the state after step 2 (holding the ball), the door is still locked, but later in step 4, the door is unlocked. So the constraint says that if in state s (step 2) I'm holding the ball, then in s or some state after s, either I'm in room_4 or yellow_door_1 is not locked. So after step 4, the door is unlocked, which satisfies the condition. So that works.

But also, the third constraint requires that I must be in room_4 in at least one state. So I need to go to room_4 at some point.

So how to get to room_4? The doors leading to room_4 are green_door_1 from room_2 and green_door_2 from room_3. But initially, all doors are locked. So I need to unlock one of them. Let's see:

From room_2, green_door_1 connects to room_4, but it's locked. So to unlock it, I need to be in front of it. So:

But to unlock green_door_1, I need to be in front of it in room_2. So steps could be:

After picking up the ball and unlocking yellow_door_1, perhaps I can unlock green_door_1 and go to room_4.

Wait, but why not go to room_4 first? Because the goal is just to have a yellow ball held. But the constraints require that I must be in room_4 at least once.

So perhaps the plan is:

1. Unlock yellow_door_1.

But initially, I'm in room_2. To unlock yellow_door_1, I need to go to it in room_2, toggle it. But yellow_door_1 is initially locked. So:

Action sequence:

- gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_1 (since I'm in room_2)

- toggle yellow_door_1 (unlocks it)

Then, pick up yellow_ball_1 in room_2. Then, since the door is unlocked, the constraint is satisfied when holding the ball.

But then I also need to go to room_4. So perhaps after that, I need to unlock green_door_1. Let's see:

But green_door_1 is in room_2 and connects to room_4. To unlock it, I need to be in front of it.

So steps:

1. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_1

2. toggle yellow_door_1 (now unlocked)

3. gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2

4. pick yellow_ball_1 room_2

5. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4

6. toggle green_door_1 (unlock it)

7. gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1 (now in room_4)

Then, drop the ball if needed, but the goal is to be holding a yellow ball. But once I'm holding it, the goal is achieved. But the constraints require that I must have been in room_4. So step 7 would satisfy that.

But the problem is that after step 4, I'm holding the ball. Then step 5 requires going to the door. Let's check if that's possible. When holding the ball, can I go to the door? The preconditions for "gotodoor" are that I'm in a room connected by the door (yes, room_2), and no object is blocking the door's position. Assuming that's true. So step 5 is possible. Then step 6 toggles the door, unlocking it. Then step 7 moves to room_4, which satisfies the third constraint.

But wait, the fourth constraint is that in some state, either empty is in room_1 or I'm holding blue_box_1. Since blue_box_1 is in room_1, but I'm never going there. However, the constraint is that in at least one state, either empty is in room_1 (which is always true, as there's an empty position) or I'm holding blue_box_1. So the first part of the condition is always true, so the constraint is satisfied. So we don't need to do anything for that.

So the plan would be:

1. Go to yellow_door_1 in room_2.

2. Toggle it to unlock.

3. Go to yellow_ball_1 in room_2.

4. Pick it up.

5. Go to green_door_1 in room_2.

6. Toggle it to unlock.

7. Go to room_4 via green_door_1.

But wait, the goal is to have a yellow ball held. So once step 4 is done, the goal is achieved, but we need to satisfy the other constraints. But the constraints are that during the plan, certain conditions must hold. So even if the goal is achieved at step 4, we still need to perform the other steps to satisfy the constraints. However, the problem states that the plan must bring about the goal and satisfy all constraints. So the plan must include actions that ensure all constraints are met in some state during the plan.

So the steps up to step 7 would satisfy all constraints:

- The first constraint (holding some object) is met at step 4.

- The second constraint (when holding, in that state or later, in room_4 or yellow_door_1 unlocked): step 4 is holding, and in step 2, yellow_door_1 is unlocked, which is after step 4? No, step 2 is before. Wait, no: step 2 is unlocking the door before picking up the ball. So when you pick up the ball (step 4), the door is already unlocked. So the constraint is satisfied in the state where you're holding the ball (step 4) because yellow_door_1 is not locked. So that's okay.

But then you need to go to room_4. So steps 5-7 are needed for the third constraint.

So the full plan would be:

1. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_1

2. toggle yellow_door_1

3. gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2

4. pick yellow_ball_1 room_2

5. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4

6. toggle green_door_1

7. gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1

But after step 7, you're in room_4. So the third constraint is satisfied.

But wait, the fourth constraint is that at some state, either empty is in room_1 or you're holding blue_box_1. Since empty is in room_1 (as there's at least one empty spot), that's always true, so the constraint is satisfied.

But wait, the problem states that the initial state includes "empty_0" as an object, but perhaps "empty is in room_1" refers to the presence of an empty position. The problem statement says "gotoempty" allows moving to an empty position. So I think "empty is in room_1" is automatically true, so the fourth constraint is satisfied.

Therefore, the plan above should work. But let's check the preconditions step by step.

Step 1: gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_1. Preconditions: I'm in a room connected by the door (room_2), and no object blocks the door's position. Assuming that's true. Then perform the action. Now, I'm in front of yellow_door_1.

Step 2: toggle yellow_door_1. Precondition: I'm in front of it. Yes. So toggle it from locked to unlocked.

Step 3: gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2. Precondition: I'm in room_2, which I am. Now I'm in front of the ball.

Step 4: pick yellow_ball_1 room_2. Preconditions: same room, not holding anything. Initially, I'm not holding anything. After picking up, I'm holding it.

Step 5: gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4. Preconditions: in room_2 (yes), and no object blocks the door's position. Assuming that's true.

Step 6: toggle green_door_1. Now it's unlocked.

Step 7: gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1. Preconditions: room_2 is adjacent to room_4 via green_door_1, door is unlocked (yes now). So move to room_4.

Now, all constraints are satisfied:

- Holding an object (step 4).

- In the state where holding (step 4), yellow_door_1 is already unlocked (step 2), so the condition is met.

- In step 7, in room_4.

- The fourth constraint is satisfied because empty is in room_1.

This plan has 7 steps. But maybe there's a shorter plan. Let's think.

Alternative approach: what if I go to room_4 first, then pick up a yellow ball there. But initially, all doors to room_4 are locked. So to get to room_4, I need to unlock green_door_1 or green_door_2.

From room_2, I can try to unlock green_door_1. But to do that, I need to be in front of it. So:

1. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4.

2. toggle green_door_1 (unlocks it).

3. gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1.

Now in room_4. Then pick up yellow_ball_3 or 4.

But after that, the second constraint: when holding the ball, either in room_4 (yes) or yellow_door_1 unlocked. Since I'm in room_4 when holding, the condition is satisfied. Also, the third constraint is met (being in room_4). The fourth constraint is still met. Then, this plan might be shorter.

Let's outline:

1. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4

2. toggle green_door_1

3. gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1

4. gotoobject yellow_ball_3 room_4 (assuming it's there)

5. pick yellow_ball_3 room_4

This is 5 steps. But wait, initial state: yellow_ball_3 and 4 are in room_4. So steps would be:

1. Go to green_door_1 in room_2.

2. Toggle to unlock.

3. Go to room_4.

4. Go to yellow_ball_3.

5. Pick it up.

But then, after step 5, the agent is in room_4, holding the yellow ball. The constraints:

- Must have held an object (yes, step 5).

- When holding (step 5), in room_4 (so satisfies the condition).

- Must have been in room_4 (step 3 and 5).

- Fourth constraint: empty in room_1 (yes).

This plan is shorter (5 steps) and meets all constraints. But why is the initial approach not optimal? The first plan had 7 steps, but this one is 5. So this is better.

But why didn't I think of this earlier? Because I thought of picking up the ball in room_2. But if the agent can go to room_4 and pick up a ball there, that's better. So this seems more optimal.

But let's check the preconditions again.

Step 1: gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4. Precondition: I'm in room_2 (yes), and no object blocks the door. Assuming that's true. Then, I'm in front of green_door_1.

Step 2: toggle green_door_1. Now it's unlocked.

Step 3: gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1. Now in room_4.

Step 4: gotoobject yellow_ball_3 room_4. Precondition: in room_4 (yes).

Step 5: pick yellow_ball_3 room_4. Preconditions: in room_4, not holding anything. After step 5, holding it.

This plan is 5 steps, which is better. But wait, the initial state says that the agent has visited room_2 already, so they start there. So yes.

But the problem is, are there any constraints that require unlocking yellow_door_1? The second constraint says that whenever you're holding an object, either you're in room_4 or yellow_door_1 is unlocked. In this plan, when you pick up the ball in room_4, you are in room_4, so the condition is satisfied. So there's no need to unlock yellow_door_1. So this plan would satisfy all constraints with fewer steps.

Therefore, the optimal plan is:

gotoempty (not needed, but perhaps needed to go to door?)

Wait, no. To go to the door, I use "gotodoor". So step 1 is correct.

Thus, the plan is:

1. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4

2. toggle green_door_1

3. gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1

4. gotoobject yellow_ball_3 room_4

5. pick yellow_ball_3 room_4

But wait, after step 3, the agent is in room_4, but not in front of any object. So step 4: gotoobject yellow_ball_3 room_4.

Yes.

Then pick it up.

This plan satisfies all constraints. Let's verify:

- Goal: holding a yellow ball (step 5).

- Constraint 1: holding some object (step 5).

- Constraint 2: when holding (step 5), in room_4, so condition met.

- Constraint 3: in room_4 (steps 3 and 5).

- Constraint 4: empty is in room_1 (always true).

So this plan is valid and shorter. Therefore, it's optimal.

But wait, the initial state says that all doors are locked, including green_door_1. So steps 1-2-3 are required to get into room_4. Then steps 4-5 to pick up the ball. That's 5 steps. So this is better.

Therefore, this is the optimal plan.
