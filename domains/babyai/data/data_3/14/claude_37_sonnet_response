Let me analyze this planning problem step by step:

**Initial State:**
- I am in room_2
- Various objects are in different rooms:
  - blue_box_1 is in room_1
  - yellow_ball_1 is in room_2
  - Several balls (yellow_ball_2, purple_ball_1, red_ball_1) are in room_3
  - Several objects (yellow_ball_3, yellow_ball_4, blue_box_2) are in room_4
- All doors are locked:
  - yellow_door_1 connects room_2 and room_1
  - purple_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3
  - green_door_1 connects room_2 and room_4
  - green_door_2 connects room_3 and room_4

**Goal:**
- I need to be holding a yellow ball.

**Constraints:**
1. I must be holding some object at some point.
2. If I'm holding an object, I must either be in room_4 or yellow_door_1 must be unlocked at that point or later.
3. I must be in room_4 at some point.
4. At some point, either "empty is in room_1" or "I'm holding blue_box_1" must be true.

**Available Actions:**
- goto object, goto empty, goto door, goto room, pick, drop, toggle

Let me think through a plan:

I'm starting in room_2 and there's a yellow_ball_1 there. I could pick this up to satisfy the goal, but according to constraint 2, if I do so, I must also ensure either I'm in room_4 or yellow_door_1 is unlocked.

So, I need to go to room_4 at some point (which also satisfies constraint 3). To do this, I need to unlock the green_door_1 which connects room_2 and room_4.

Let's plan:

1. First, I'll goto the door green_door_1 (connects room_2 and room_4).
2. Toggle it to unlock it.
3. Go to room_4 from room_2 using green_door_1.
4. In room_4, I can pick up yellow_ball_3 or yellow_ball_4 to satisfy the goal.

This plan satisfies all but the 4th constraint. For the 4th constraint, I need to either have "empty is in room_1" (which I'm not sure how to make true as there's no action to create empty objects) or "I'm holding blue_box_1", which is in room_1.

So I would need to:
5. Go back to room_2 from room_4.
6. Goto the door yellow_door_1 (connects room_2 and room_1).
7. Toggle it to unlock it.
8. Go to room_1 from room_2 using yellow_door_1.
9. Pickup blue_box_1. This would satisfy the 4th constraint.

But if I do this, I would not be holding a yellow ball anymore. I need to figure out a sequence where I can satisfy all constraints.

Let's revise the approach:

Hmm, actually I think I might be misunderstanding the 4th constraint. "empty is in room_1" might refer to an empty position in room_1, not an object named "empty". But it's also worded as "empty is in room_1", which suggests "empty" is an object.

Actually, looking at the objects list, there is an "empty_0 empty". So "empty" is indeed an object. But I'm not clear on how to make "empty is in room_1" true. It's possible I'm overlooking something.

Let me rethink this:

One way to satisfy the 4th constraint would be to hold blue_box_1. But I also need to be holding a yellow ball for the main goal. I can't hold both at the same time, so I would need to pick up blue_box_1 at some point and then drop it, and later pick up a yellow ball.

Let's structure a new plan:

1. Goto the door yellow_door_1 (connects room_2 and room_1).
2. Toggle it to unlock it. This would also satisfy the second part of constraint 2.
3. Go to room_1 from room_2 using yellow_door_1.
4. Goto blue_box_1 in room_1.
5. Pick up blue_box_1. This satisfies constraint 4.
6. Goto an empty position in room_1 (or any position where I can drop the box).
7. Drop blue_box_1.
8. Go back to room_2 from room_1 using yellow_door_1.
9. Goto the door green_door_1 (connects room_2 and room_4).
10. Toggle it to unlock it.
11. Go to room_4 from room_2 using green_door_1. This satisfies constraint 3.
12. Goto yellow_ball_3 (or yellow_ball_4) in room_4.
13. Pick up the yellow ball. This satisfies constraint 1 and the main goal.

Alright, I think we now have a plan that satisfies all the constraints and the main goal. Let's refine it:

Actually I'm thinking about this more, and I'm confused about this constraint:

"The following expression must hold in at least one state: 
  "At least one of the following conditions is true: "empty is in room_1", "you are holding blue_box_1"""

I'm sure "empty is in room_1" doesn't refer to an empty position, since the syntax refers to an object being in a room. But I don't see how to make "empty" (which I assume is "empty_0") be in room_1, especially given the actions available.

I think I'm facing a problem of ambiguity. Let me try to reconsider the constraint based on the actions and predicates available:

Ok, revisiting the empty_0 object - this is explicitly listed in the world objects. It says: "empty_0 empty". This means there's an object named "empty_0" of type "empty". But it's not in any room. Maybe I need to put it in room_1? But I don't see how I can create or manipulate "empty_0".

Actually, I don't think the constraint is asking for "empty_0" to be in room_1. It might be more about the predicate "empty is in room_1", which could be a property of room_1 rather than an object. Maybe it's saying there should be an empty position in room_1.

Actually, it's probably related to one of the predicates in the actions. For the "drop" action, it says, "After performing this action regarding an object x, ... (iv) object x is situated in the room you are currently in." So, if I drop blue_box_1 in room_1, then blue_box_1 is in room_1. But I don't see a direct way to make "empty is in room_1" true.

Wait, there's also the "gotoempty" action which says, "Go in front of an empty position of the room, which does not contain any object." Maybe after this action, "empty is in room_1" becomes true. This could be the way to satisfy that part of the constraint.

Let's revise the plan again:

1. Goto the door yellow_door_1 (connects room_2 and room_1).
2. Toggle it to unlock it. This would also satisfy the second part of constraint 2.
3. Go to room_1 from room_2 using yellow_door_1.
4. Goto an empty position in room_1. This might satisfy "empty is in room_1" in constraint 4.
5. Goto the door green_door_1 (connects room_2 and room_4).
6. Toggle it to unlock it.
7. Go to room_4 from room_2 using green_door_1. This satisfies constraint 3.
8. Goto yellow_ball_3 (or yellow_ball_4) in room_4.
9. Pick up the yellow ball. This satisfies constraint 1 and the main goal.

Wait, the above doesn't work because I'm trying to go directly from room_1 to door green_door_1, but they're not directly connected. I need to go back to room_2 first:

1. Goto the door yellow_door_1 (connects room_2 and room_1).
2. Toggle it to unlock it. This would also satisfy the second part of constraint 2.
3. Go to room_1 from room_2 using yellow_door_1.
4. Goto an empty position in room_1. This might satisfy "empty is in room_1" in constraint 4.
5. Go back to room_2 from room_1 using yellow_door_1.
6. Goto the door green_door_1 (connects room_2 and room_4).
7. Toggle it to unlock it.
8. Go to room_4 from room_2 using green_door_1. This satisfies constraint 3.
9. Goto yellow_ball_3 (or yellow_ball_4) in room_4.
10. Pick up the yellow ball. This satisfies constraint 1 and the main goal.

Hmm, ok, this is confusing me. Let me take a step back and think about the original definition of the empty object. We have: "empty_0 empty"

Wait, I know what's happening. I don't think "empty_0 empty" is a world object. Instead, this might be the domain type definition: "empty_0" is the name of the object, and "empty" is the type. So, there's an object named "empty_0" of type "empty".

I guess the 4th constraint is asking for one of two conditions:
1. "empty is in room_1": This could mean there's an empty position in room_1. This might be true by default, or it might be achievable using the "gotoempty" action while in room_1.
2. "you are holding blue_box_1": This means I need to pick up blue_box_1.

Given the uncertainty of the first condition, it's safer to ensure the second condition.

Alright, let's refine the plan:

1. Goto the door yellow_door_1 (connects room_2 and room_1).
2. Toggle it to unlock it. This would also satisfy the second part of constraint 2.
3. Go to room_1 from room_2 using yellow_door_1.
4. Goto blue_box_1 in room_1.
5. Pick up blue_box_1. This satisfies constraint 4.
6. Go back to room_2 from room_1 using yellow_door_1.
7. Goto an empty position.
8. Drop blue_box_1.
9. Goto the door green_door_1 (connects room_2 and room_4).
10. Toggle it to unlock it.
11. Go to room_4 from room_2 using green_door_1. This satisfies constraint 3.
12. Goto yellow_ball_3 (or yellow_ball_4) in room_4.
13. Pick up the yellow ball. This satisfies constraint 1 and the main goal.

I think this plan should satisfy all the constraints and the goal. It's just a bit roundabout because I need to pick up blue_box_1 to satisfy constraint 4, then drop it, and then pick up a yellow ball to satisfy the main goal.

Actually one more time: I'm not sure the action format for "gotoroom" is correct. It says:
"gotoroom r1 r2 d": Go to room r2 from room r1 using door d.

So let's make sure I have the correct format for all actions:

1. "gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_1": Go in front of the door yellow_door_1, which connects room_2 to room_1. (I'm already in room_2)
2. "toggle yellow_door_1": Unlock the door.
3. "gotoroom room_2 room_1 yellow_door_1": Go from room_2 to room_1 using yellow_door_1.
4. "gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1": Go in front of blue_box_1 in room_1.
5. "pick blue_box_1 room_1": Pick up blue_box_1 from room_1. This satisfies constraint 4.
6. "gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1": Go from room_1 to room_2 using yellow_door_1.
7. "gotoempty": Go in front of an empty position.
8. "drop blue_box_1 room_2": Drop blue_box_1 in room_2.
9. "gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4": Go in front of the door green_door_1, which connects room_2 to room_4.
10. "toggle green_door_1": Unlock the door.
11. "gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1": Go from room_2 to room_4 using green_door_1. This satisfies constraint 3.
12. "gotoobject yellow_ball_3 room_4": Go in front of yellow_ball_3 in room_4.
13. "pick yellow_ball_3 room_4": Pick up yellow_ball_3. This satisfies constraint 1 and the main goal.

In summary, I'll:
1. Go to room_1 and pick up blue_box_1 to satisfy constraint 4.
2. Return to room_2, drop blue_box_1.
3. Go to room_4 to satisfy constraint 3.
4. Pick up a yellow ball in room_4 to satisfy the main goal and constraint 1.
5. Being in room_4 while holding a yellow ball satisfies constraint 2.

I think this is the optimal plan!

Let me finalize in the requested format:

```
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_1
toggle yellow_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_1 yellow_door_1
gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1
pick blue_box_1 room_1
gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1
gotoempty
drop blue_box_1 room_2
gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4
toggle green_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1
gotoobject yellow_ball_3 room_4
pick yellow_ball_3 room_4
```

But let me review once more to check if there's an even simpler plan:

Actually, instead of picking and dropping blue_box_1, I can just pick up yellow_ball_1 in room_2, then go to room_4 to satisfy that constraint. This would eliminate the need to go to room_1 and deal with blue_box_1. But then I'd still need to satisfy constraint 4, which asks for either "empty is in room_1" or "you are holding blue_box_1".

So I think the plan I've provided is the most straightforward way to satisfy all the constraints and the goal.

Wait, I am in room_2 and yellow_ball_1 is also in room_2. I can pick it up, then go to room_4, which would satisfy constraints 1, 2, and 3, and the main goal.

But we still need constraint 4: "At least one of the following conditions is true: 'empty is in room_1', 'you are holding blue_box_1'"

If "empty is in room_1" means there's an empty position in room_1, then maybe all rooms have empty positions by default, and I don't need to ensure this condition. If that's the case, I can simplify the plan. But if I need to explicitly satisfy this condition, I'd stick with the plan I provided above.

Given the uncertainty, I'll go ahead with the plan I provided, which ensures all constraints and the main goal are satisfied:

```
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_1
toggle yellow_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_1 yellow_door_1
gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1
pick blue_box_1 room_1
gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1
gotoempty
drop blue_box_1 room_2
gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4
toggle green_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1
gotoobject yellow_ball_3 room_4
pick yellow_ball_3 room_4
```

Let me check for redundancies in the plan again:

1. "gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_1": Go to yellow_door_1 from room_2.
2. "toggle yellow_door_1": Unlock yellow_door_1.
3. "gotoroom room_2 room_1 yellow_door_1": Go to room_1 from room_2 via yellow_door_1.
4. "gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1": Go to blue_box_1 in room_1.
5. "pick blue_box_1 room_1": Pick up blue_box_1.
6. "gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1": Go back to room_2.
7. "gotoempty": Go to an empty position.
8. "drop blue_box_1 room_2": Drop blue_box_1.
9. "gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4": Go to green_door_1 from room_2.
10. "toggle green_door_1": Unlock green_door_1.
11. "gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1": Go to room_4 from room_2 via green_door_1.
12. "gotoobject yellow_ball_3 room_4": Go to yellow_ball_3 in room_4.
13. "pick yellow_ball_3 room_4": Pick up yellow_ball_3.

Ok, I believe this plan is optimal given the constraints and the goal. I can simplify it slightly by not moving blue_box_1:

1. "gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_1": Go to yellow_door_1 from room_2.
2. "toggle yellow_door_1": Unlock yellow_door_1.
3. "gotoroom room_2 room_1 yellow_door_1": Go to room_1 from room_2 via yellow_door_1.
4. "gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1": Go to blue_box_1 in room_1.
5. "pick blue_box_1 room_1": Pick up blue_box_1. Now we're holding blue_box_1, which satisfies constraint 4.
6. "gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1": Go back to room_2.
7. "gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4": Go to green_door_1 from room_2. Note that we're already holding blue_box_1, which means constraint 2 is indirectly satisfied (because yellow_door_1 is already unlocked).
8. "toggle green_door_1": Unlock green_door_1.
9. "gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1": Go to room_4 from room_2 via green_door_1. This satisfies constraint 3.
10. "gotoempty": Go to an empty position.
11. "drop blue_box_1 room_4": Drop blue_box_1 in room_4. We can't pick up yellow_ball_3 unless we first drop blue_box_1. We're no longer holding blue_box_1, but that's fine because constraint 4 only requires us to hold blue_box_1 at some point, not continuously.
12. "gotoobject yellow_ball_3 room_4": Go to yellow_ball_3 in room_4.
13. "pick yellow_ball_3 room_4": Pick up yellow_ball_3. This satisfies constraint 1 and the main goal.

Actually, let me see if I need to carry the blue_box_1 at all. Let me go through the constraints again:

1. "you are holding some object": Satisfied by holding yellow_ball_3 (or any yellow ball).
2. If I hold something, then I must be in room_4 or yellow_door_1 must be unlocked. This is satisfied as I will be in room_4 while holding yellow_ball_3.
3. "you are in room_4": Satisfied by going to room_4.
4. Either "empty is in room_1" or "you are holding blue_box_1".

I can satisfy 1, 2, and 3 by just picking up yellow_ball_1 in room_2 and going to room_4. But constraint 4 requires me to ensure "empty is in room_1" or "you are holding blue_box_1". 

Since I'm not sure what "empty is in room_1" means, I've been planning to satisfy "you are holding blue_box_1" by picking up blue_box_1. 

Alright, I think the plan I provided above, where I pick up blue_box_1, carry it to room_4, drop it, and then pick up yellow_ball_3, is the safest approach to satisfy all the constraints and the main goal.

Final plan:

```
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_1
toggle yellow_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_1 yellow_door_1
gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1
pick blue_box_1 room_1
gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1
gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4
toggle green_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1
gotoempty
drop blue_box_1 room_4
gotoobject yellow_ball_3 room_4
pick yellow_ball_3 room_4
```

On second thought, let me check if there's a simpler approach:

I can start in room_2, pick up yellow_ball_1, go to room_4, and that will satisfy the goal. I'll be holding an object and be in room_4, which satisfies constraints 1, 2, and 3. So the remaining issue is constraint 4: "empty is in room_1" or "you are holding blue_box_1".

One way to satisfy it is to pick up blue_box_1, carry it to room_4, drop it, and then pick up yellow_ball_1. But that's a bit indirect. I'm still unsure about what "empty is in room_1" means. If it means there's an empty position in room_1, then I could check if it's true by default or if I need to ensure it (maybe by going to room_1 and using the "gotoempty" action).

Given the uncertainty, I'm going to stick with the approach above, which ensures all constraints and the goal are satisfied.

Actually, one last thought: Instead of starting with yellow_door_1, I could start with green_door_1. I could go to room_4, pick up a yellow ball, drop it, then go to room_1 (via room_2) to pick up blue_box_1, and then return to room_4 to pick up the yellow ball again. This might lead to a similar number of steps but a different sequence.

Let me think...actually, let me consider starting with yellow_ball_1 in room_2.

Starting in room_2, I can:
1. Pick up yellow_ball_1.
2. Go to room_4.
3. Drop yellow_ball_1.
4. Go back to room_1 (via room_2) to pick up blue_box_1.
5. Go back to room_4 (via room_2) and drop blue_box_1.
6. Pick up yellow_ball_1 (or any yellow ball).

This is about the same number of steps, but I'm not sure if it's more optimal. It seems like the simplest is the approach we considered earlier: pick up blue_box_1 from room_1, drop it in room_4, then pick up a yellow ball in room_4.

Actually, here's a new plan:

1. "gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4": Go to the door connecting room_2 and room_4.
2. "toggle green_door_1": Unlock the door.
3. "gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1": Go from room_2 to room_4. This satisfies constraint 3.
4. "gotoobject yellow_ball_3 room_4": Go to yellow_ball_3.
5. "pick yellow_ball_3 room_4": Pick up yellow_ball_3. We're now holding a yellow ball in room_4, which satisfies constraints 1 and 2.
6. "gotoempty": Go to an empty position.
7. "drop yellow_ball_3 room_4": Drop yellow_ball_3.
8. "gotoobject yellow_ball_4 room_4": Go to yellow_ball_4.
9. "pick yellow_ball_4 room_4": Pick up yellow_ball_4. We're holding a yellow ball, which satisfies the main goal.
10. "gotoempty": Go to an empty position.
11. "drop yellow_ball_4 room_4": Drop yellow_ball_4.
12. "gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2": Go to door green_door_1 from room_4.
13. "gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_1": Go from room_4 to room_2.
14. "gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_1": Go to door yellow_door_1 from room_2.
15. "toggle yellow_door_1": Unlock door yellow_door_1.
16. "gotoroom room_2 room_1 yellow_door_1": Go from room_2 to room_1.
17. "gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1": Go to blue_box_1.
18. "pick blue_box_1 room_1": Pick up blue_box_1. This satisfies constraint 4.
19. "gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1": Go from room_1 to room_2.
20. "gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1": Go from room_2 to room_4.
21. "gotoempty": Go to an empty position.
22. "drop blue_box_1 room_4": Drop blue_box_1.
23. "gotoobject yellow_ball_3 room_4": Go to yellow_ball_3.
24. "pick yellow_ball_3 room_4": Pick up yellow_ball_3. We're now holding a yellow ball, which satisfies the main goal.

But that's many more steps than the previous plan, so I think it's not optimal.

I should go with the first approach:

1. "gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_1": Go to yellow_door_1 from room_2.
2. "toggle yellow_door_1": Unlock yellow_door_1.
3. "gotoroom room_2 room_1 yellow_door_1": Go to room_1 from room_2 via yellow_door_1.
4. "gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1": Go to blue_box_1 in room_1.
5. "pick blue_box_1 room_1": Pick up blue_box_1. Now we're holding blue_box_1, which satisfies constraint 4.
6. "gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1": Go back to room_2.
7. "gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4": Go to green_door_1 from room_2. Note that we're already holding blue_box_1, which means constraint 2 is indirectly satisfied (because yellow_door_1 is already unlocked).
8. "toggle green_door_1": Unlock green_door_1.
9. "gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1": Go to room_4 from room_2 via green_door_1. This satisfies constraint 3.
10. "gotoempty": Go to an empty position.
11. "drop blue_box_1 room_4": Drop blue_box_1 in room_4. We can't pick up yellow_ball_3 unless we first drop blue_box_1.
12. "gotoobject yellow_ball_3 room_4": Go to yellow_ball_3 in room_4.
13. "pick yellow_ball_3 room_4": Pick up yellow_ball_3. This satisfies constraint 1 and the main goal.

I think this is an efficient path that satisfies all constraints and the goal.

Final plan:

```
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_1
toggle yellow_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_1 yellow_door_1
gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1
pick blue_box_1 room_1
gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1
gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4
toggle green_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1
gotoempty
drop blue_box_1 room_4
gotoobject yellow_ball_3 room_4
pick yellow_ball_3 room_4
```

This should be the optimal plan for the given problem.
