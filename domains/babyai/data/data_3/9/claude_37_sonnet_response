Alright, let's break down the planning problem:

### Initial State:
- You are in room_4.
- blue_box_1 is in room_1 and is blue.
- blue_ball_1 is in room_1 and is blue.
- grey_box_1 is in room_2 and is grey.
- yellow_box_1 is in room_2 and is yellow.
- grey_ball_1 is in room_3 and is grey.
- blue_ball_2 is in room_4 and is blue.
- grey_ball_2 is in room_4 and is grey.
- purple_ball_1 is in room_4 and is purple.
- All doors (yellow_door_1, purple_door_1, purple_door_2, grey_door_1) are locked.
- Door connections: 
  - room_1 and room_2 via yellow_door_1
  - room_1 and room_3 via purple_door_1
  - room_2 and room_4 via purple_door_2
  - room_3 and room_4 via grey_door_1
- You have visited room_4.

### Goal:
- You are holding blue_box_1 in room_1.

### Constraints:
1. You must be in room_1 at some point.
2. If you are in room_1, there must be an earlier state where grey_door_1 was unlocked.
3. Either grey_ball_1 is in room_2 or you are in front of blue_ball_2 at some point.
4. There must be a state where you are holding purple_ball_1 and are in front of blue_ball_2.

Let's first understand the layout of the gridworld:

```
+--------+      +---------+
| room_1 |------| room_3  |
|        |      |         |
|        |      |         |
+--------+      +---------+
     |                |
     |                |
+--------+      +---------+
| room_2 |------| room_4  |
|        |      |         |
|        |      |         |
+--------+      +---------+
```

So the doors are:
- yellow_door_1: Connects room_1 and room_2
- purple_door_1: Connects room_1 and room_3
- purple_door_2: Connects room_2 and room_4
- grey_door_1: Connects room_3 and room_4

To achieve the goal, you need to be in room_1 and hold the blue_box_1. 

Let's come up with a plan.

First, let's consider the constraints:

For constraint 3, we need to either move grey_ball_1 from room_3 to room_2 or stand in front of blue_ball_2 at some point. Since we're already in room_4 and blue_ball_2 is in room_4, it might be more direct to stand in front of blue_ball_2.

For constraint 4, we need to pick up purple_ball_1 (which is in room_4) and also be in front of blue_ball_2 (which is also in room_4). 

For constraint 2, we need to unlock grey_door_1 before going to room_1.

Let's try to come up with a sequence of actions:

1. You're in room_4. Go in front of blue_ball_2 (to satisfy constraint 3). 
2. Pick up purple_ball_1 while still in front of blue_ball_2 (to satisfy constraint 4).
3. Go to grey_door_1 in room_4 connecting to room_3.
4. Toggle grey_door_1 to unlock it.
5. Go to room_3 from room_4 via grey_door_1.
6. Go to purple_door_1 in room_3 connecting to room_1.
7. Toggle purple_door_1 to unlock it.
8. Go to room_1 from room_3 via purple_door_1.
9. Drop purple_ball_1 (to free your hands).
10. Go to blue_box_1 in room_1.
11. Pick up blue_box_1 (achieving the goal).

But wait, I forgot to check if this is possible according to the preconditions. Let's review:

Problem: To pick up purple_ball_1, I need to be in front of it, not in front of blue_ball_2. Let me fix this.

1. You're in room_4. Go in front of blue_ball_2 (to satisfy constraint 3).
2. Go in front of purple_ball_1.
3. Pick up purple_ball_1.
4. Go in front of blue_ball_2 again (to satisfy constraint 4).
5. Go to grey_door_1 in room_4 connecting to room_3.
6. Toggle grey_door_1 to unlock it.
7. Go to room_3 from room_4 via grey_door_1.
8. Go to purple_door_1 in room_3 connecting to room_1.
9. Toggle purple_door_1 to unlock it.
10. Go to room_1 from room_3 via purple_door_1.
11. Drop purple_ball_1 (to free your hands).
12. Go to blue_box_1 in room_1.
13. Pick up blue_box_1 (achieving the goal).

Wait, there's another issue with the above plan. When you're in front of blue_ball_2, you can't pick up purple_ball_1 (because you're not in front of it). And to pick up any object, you need to be in front of it. Let me refine the plan.

1. You're in room_4. Go in front of blue_ball_2 (to satisfy constraint 3).
2. Go in front of purple_ball_1.
3. Pick up purple_ball_1.
4. Go in front of blue_ball_2 again (to satisfy constraint 4).
5. Go in front of grey_door_1 in room_4 connecting to room_3.
6. Toggle grey_door_1 to unlock it (satisfying constraint 2).
7. Go to room_3 from room_4 via grey_door_1.
8. Drop purple_ball_1 (we don't need it anymore, and we need free hands to pick up blue_box_1).
9. Go in front of purple_door_1 in room_3 connecting to room_1.
10. Toggle purple_door_1 to unlock it.
11. Go to room_1 from room_3 via purple_door_1 (satisfying constraint 1).
12. Go in front of blue_box_1 in room_1.
13. Pick up blue_box_1 (achieving the goal).

Actually, I've missed another subtlety. The constraint is:

"The following expression must hold in at least one state: "The following conditions are all true: "you are holding purple_ball_1", "you are in front of blue_ball_2"""

So I need to be holding purple_ball_1 AND be in front of blue_ball_2 at the same time. Let's adjusting again:

1. You're in room_4. Go in front of purple_ball_1.
2. Pick up purple_ball_1.
3. Go in front of blue_ball_2 (now satisfying the constraint: you are holding purple_ball_1 and you are in front of blue_ball_2).
4. Go in front of grey_door_1 in room_4 connecting to room_3.
5. Toggle grey_door_1 to unlock it (satisfying the constraint about unlocking grey_door_1 before being in room_1).
6. Go to room_3 from room_4 via grey_door_1.
7. Drop purple_ball_1 (we don't need it anymore, and we need free hands to pick up blue_box_1).
8. Go in front of purple_door_1 in room_3 connecting to room_1.
9. Toggle purple_door_1 to unlock it.
10. Go to room_1 from room_3 via purple_door_1 (satisfying the constraint about being in room_1).
11. Go in front of blue_box_1 in room_1.
12. Pick up blue_box_1 (achieving the goal: you are holding the blue box and you are in room_1).

Wait, checking the constraints again:

"At least one of the following conditions is true: "grey_ball_1 is in room_2", "you are in front of blue_ball_2""

So I need to either move grey_ball_1 from room_3 to room_2 OR be in front of blue_ball_2 at some point.

This doesn't change the plan, because we're already planning to be in front of blue_ball_2, but I wanted to clarify.

I think this plan satisfies all constraints and achieves the goal. Let's ensure the above plan is correctly formulated.

I believe the steps in the above plan are:

1. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4
2. pick purple_ball_1 room_4
3. gotoobject blue_ball_2 room_4
4. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3
5. toggle grey_door_1
6. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1
7. gotoempty
8. drop purple_ball_1 room_3
9. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_1
10. toggle purple_door_1
11. gotoroom room_3 room_1 purple_door_1
12. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1
13. pick blue_box_1 room_1

However, I realized something potentially important: when I drop an object, I need to be in front of an empty position. However, in step 7, I'm planning to go to an empty position to drop the purple ball. So the plan is correct in that aspect.

Also, after checking again, I'm actually not sure if I need to go in front of a door to toggle it or if I just need to be in the room. The description says: "toggle: you may only toggle a door d if you are in front of d." So I do need to be in front of the door. The plan accommodates this.

I think the plan is correct now. Let's review one more time:

1. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4
2. pick purple_ball_1 room_4
3. gotoobject blue_ball_2 room_4
4. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3
5. toggle grey_door_1
6. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1
7. gotoempty
8. drop purple_ball_1 room_3
9. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_1
10. toggle purple_door_1
11. gotoroom room_3 room_1 purple_door_1
12. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1
13. pick blue_box_1 room_1

This achieves the goal and satisfies all constraints.

Wait, let's actually make sure I got the room layout correct earlier:

We have:
- room_2 and room_1 are connected via yellow_door_1
- room_1 and room_3 are connected via purple_door_1
- room_4 and room_2 are connected via purple_door_2
- room_4 and room_3 are connected via grey_door_1

So the rooms are connected like this:

```
+--------+      +---------+
| room_1 |------| room_3  |
|        |purple_1        |
|        |      |         |
+--------+      +---------+
yellow_1 |                | grey_1
     |                |
     |                |
+--------+      +---------+
| room_2 |------| room_4  |
|        |purple_2        |
|        |      |         |
+--------+      +---------+
```

Yes, this is correct.

Let's double-check my plan again:

1. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4
2. pick purple_ball_1 room_4
3. gotoobject blue_ball_2 room_4
4. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3
5. toggle grey_door_1
6. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1
7. gotoempty
8. drop purple_ball_1 room_3
9. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_1
10. toggle purple_door_1
11. gotoroom room_3 room_1 purple_door_1
12. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1
13. pick blue_box_1 room_1

I think this achieves the goal and satisfies all constraints. But let's double-check one more time.

Goal: "There is a box v such that "The following conditions are all true: "v is blue", "you are holding v", "you are in room_1"""

After the final step, I am holding blue_box_1 (which is blue) and I am in room_1. So the goal is achieved.

Constraints:
1. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: "you are in room_1""
   - After step 11, I am in room_1. So this constraint is satisfied.

2. "If expression "you are in room_1" holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: "grey_door_1 is not locked""
   - After step 5, grey_door_1 is unlocked. And I go to room_1 in step 11. So this constraint is satisfied.

3. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: "At least one of the following conditions is true: "grey_ball_1 is in room_2", "you are in front of blue_ball_2"""
   - After step 3, I am in front of blue_ball_2. So this constraint is satisfied.

4. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: "The following conditions are all true: "you are holding purple_ball_1", "you are in front of blue_ball_2"""
   - After step 3, I am holding purple_ball_1 and I am in front of blue_ball_2. So this constraint is satisfied.

All constraints are satisfied, and the goal is achieved. The plan is valid.

I should note that I'm starting from room_4, and blue_ball_2 and purple_ball_1 are also in room_4. That's why I'm able to interact with them directly.

I think the plan is optimal as well, as it takes the shortest path to the goal while satisfying all constraints.

So, the final plan is:

1. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4
2. pick purple_ball_1 room_4
3. gotoobject blue_ball_2 room_4
4. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3
5. toggle grey_door_1
6. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1
7. gotoempty
8. drop purple_ball_1 room_3
9. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_1
10. toggle purple_door_1
11. gotoroom room_3 room_1 purple_door_1
12. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1
13. pick blue_box_1 room_1
