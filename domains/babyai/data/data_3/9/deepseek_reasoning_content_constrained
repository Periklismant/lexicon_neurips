Okay, let's try to figure out how to solve this planning problem. The goal is to have a blue box that I'm holding while in room_1. The constraints are a bit tricky, so I need to make sure I meet all of them. Let me start by breaking down the problem.

First, the initial state: I'm in room_4. The blue_box_1 is in room_1. So I need to get to room_1 and pick up that box. But the doors are locked. The doors connecting rooms are yellow_door_1 (between room_1 and 2), purple_door_1 (room_1 and 3), purple_door_2 (room_2 and 4), and grey_door_1 (room_3 and 4). All doors are locked initially.

Constraints to satisfy:

1. Must be in room_1 at least once. That's part of the goal anyway.
2. If I'm in room_1 in some state, there must have been a previous state where grey_door_1 was unlocked. So before entering room_1, I need to have unlocked grey_door_1. Wait, but grey_door_1 connects room_3 and 4. How does that relate to getting to room_1? Hmm, maybe the path to room_1 requires using grey_door_1? Let me think. The rooms are arranged in a square: 1 is NW, 2 SW, 3 NE, 4 SE. Doors connect 1-2 (yellow), 1-3 (purple), 2-4 (purple), 3-4 (grey). So from room_4, I can go to room_2 via purple_door_2 or to room_3 via grey_door_1. To get to room_1, maybe from room_3 via purple_door_1, but that's locked. Or from room_2 via yellow_door_1, also locked. So I need to unlock doors.

But the second constraint says that if I'm in room_1, there must have been a previous state where grey_door_1 was unlocked. So even if I take a different path, I must have unlocked grey_door_1 at some point before entering room_1. Interesting. So perhaps I need to unlock grey_door_1 even if I don't use it? But how would that affect entering room_1? Maybe the path requires passing through rooms that need the grey_door to be unlocked. Let me map possible paths.

Starting in room_4. To get to room_1, possible paths:

Option 1: room_4 -> room_2 via purple_door_2 (but it's locked), then room_2 -> room_1 via yellow_door_1 (locked). Need to unlock both doors. But according to constraint 2, when I get to room_1, grey_door_1 must have been unlocked earlier. But if I take this path, I didn't use grey_door_1. So that would violate the constraint. So maybe this path is invalid.

Option 2: room_4 -> room_3 via grey_door_1 (locked), need to unlock it. Then room_3 -> room_1 via purple_door_1 (locked). Then unlock purple_door_1. Then go to room_1. But in this case, when I enter room_1, the grey_door_1 was unlocked earlier (since I had to unlock it to get from 4 to 3). So this path would satisfy constraint 2. Because entering room_1 via purple_door_1 (room_3 to 1) requires having unlocked grey_door_1 to get from 4 to 3. So that would satisfy the constraint.

So perhaps the path is room_4 -> room_3 (unlock grey_door_1), then room_3 -> room_1 (unlock purple_door_1), then enter room_1. But the problem is, the initial doors are all locked, so I can't move between rooms unless I first unlock the doors. But to unlock a door, I need to be in front of it. So to unlock grey_door_1, I need to be in front of it. But grey_door_1 connects room_3 and 4. So if I'm in room_4, I can go to the position in front of grey_door_1 (if there's no object blocking it), then toggle (unlock) it. Then go to room_3. Then in room_3, go to purple_door_1 (which connects to room_1), toggle it, then go to room_1. Then in room_1, pick up the blue_box_1.

But wait, let's check the initial positions of objects. The objects in room_4 are blue_ball_2, grey_ball_2, purple_ball_1. Are any of these blocking the doors? The preconditions for goto door require that there's no object blocking the position in front of the door in the current room. So if there's an object in front of the door in room_4, I can't go to the door. So for grey_door_1 in room_4, are there any objects blocking it? The initial state says the objects in room_4 are blue_ball_2, grey_ball_2, purple_ball_1. But where are they placed? The problem doesn't specify their exact positions, but the "gotoobject" action requires being in the same room. So maybe the doors are not blocked by objects unless specified. Wait, the problem says that "the position in front of d in the room you are currently in" must not be blocked. But unless the objects are explicitly said to be in front of doors, we can assume they are not. So perhaps the doors are unblocked initially. So I can go to the door in room_4 (grey_door_1), unlock it, then go through to room_3. Then from room_3, go to purple_door_1 (connecting to room_1), unlock it, go to room_1. Then pick up the blue_box_1.

But then, let's check the constraints. The third constraint says that in at least one state, either grey_ball_1 is in room_2, or I'm in front of blue_ball_2. The fourth constraint requires that in at least one state, I'm holding purple_ball_1 and in front of blue_ball_2.

So during the plan, I need to have a state where I'm holding purple_ball_1 and in front of blue_ball_2. Since blue_ball_2 is initially in room_4, perhaps I need to pick up purple_ball_1 in room_4, then drop it somewhere, but that might not be necessary. Wait, the fourth constraint is that in some state, both holding purple_ball_1 and being in front of blue_ball_2. So I need to be in front of blue_ball_2 while holding purple_ball_1. That can be done in room_4. So perhaps after picking up purple_ball_1, I need to go to blue_ball_2's position, but since I can't carry two objects, perhaps I can pick up purple_ball_1, then go to blue_ball_2 (but I can't, because once I pick up purple_ball_1, I'm holding it, and to go to blue_ball_2, I can do "gotoobject blue_ball_2 room_4" since I'm in room_4. Then, in that state, I'm holding purple_ball_1 and in front of blue_ball_2. That would satisfy the fourth constraint. Then maybe drop purple_ball_1 somewhere else later.

So steps for constraints 3 and 4: pick up purple_ball_1 in room_4, then go to blue_ball_2. Then proceed with unlocking doors.

Let me outline the steps:

1. In room_4, goto purple_ball_1 (gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4)
2. pick purple_ball_1 (now holding it)
3. gotoobject blue_ball_2 room_4 (now in front of blue_ball_2, holding purple_ball_1 → satisfies constraint 4)
4. Now, need to unlock grey_door_1. To do that, first, need to be in front of grey_door_1 in room_4. So gotoempty (to leave the object's front position) or goto door.

Wait, after step 3, I'm in front of blue_ball_2. To go to the door, I need to perform gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3. But to do that, I must be in a room connected by the door (room_4 is connected via grey_door_1 to room_3, so that's okay), and no object is blocking the position in front of the door in room_4. Assuming the door's front position is not blocked, then I can go to the door.

So after step 3, I'm holding purple_ball_1 and in front of blue_ball_2. Then:

4. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3 (now in front of grey_door_1)
5. toggle grey_door_1 (unlocks it)
6. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1 (now in room_3)
7. Now, need to unlock purple_door_1 (connecting room_3 to room_1). To do that, goto door purple_door_1 room_3 room_1. Then toggle it.
8. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_1
9. toggle purple_door_1 (unlocks it)
10. gotoroom room_3 room_1 purple_door_1 (now in room_1)
11. Now, in room_1. Need to pick up blue_box_1. So gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1
12. pick blue_box_1

But wait, after step 6, when I go to room_3, I need to check if there are any objects blocking the door. The initial state says grey_ball_1 is in room_3. If grey_ball_1 is in front of purple_door_1, then I can't go to that door. But the problem doesn't specify object positions, so assuming that the doors are not blocked. So steps 7-10 are possible.

Now, let's check the constraints:

- The third constraint requires that in at least one state, either grey_ball_1 is in room_2 or I'm in front of blue_ball_2. In step 3, I was in front of blue_ball_2, so that satisfies it.

- The fourth constraint is satisfied in step 3 (holding purple_ball_1 and in front of blue_ball_2).

- The second constraint: when entering room_1 (step 10), there must have been a prior state where grey_door_1 was unlocked. Step 5 unlocks grey_door_1, which is before entering room_1. So that's satisfied.

So the plan would look like:

1. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4
2. pick purple_ball_1 room_4
3. gotoobject blue_ball_2 room_4 (now in front of blue_ball_2, holding purple_ball_1 → satisfies constraint 4)
4. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3
5. toggle grey_door_1 (unlocks it)
6. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1
7. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_1
8. toggle purple_door_1 (unlocks it)
9. gotoroom room_3 room_1 purple_door_1
10. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1
11. pick blue_box_1 room_1

But wait, when dropping the purple_ball_1, do I need to? Because the goal is to be holding the blue box in room_1. So after step 3, I'm holding purple_ball_1. But to pick up the blue box, I need to have free hands. So I need to drop the purple_ball_1 somewhere before picking up the box.

Ah, right! So between steps 3 and 11, I need to drop the purple_ball_1. Where?

After step 3, I'm in front of blue_ball_2 in room_4, holding purple_ball_1. Then steps 4-10 take me to room_1. But I can't carry the purple_ball_1 into room_1 unless I take it there. But the problem is, after step 3, I need to drop it somewhere. Let's see:

Wait, after step 3, I'm holding purple_ball_1. Then steps 4: goto door grey_door_1. Step 5: toggle. Then step 6: go to room_3. When moving to room_3, I'm carrying the purple_ball_1. Then in room_3, I need to go to purple_door_1. Then unlock it. Then go to room_1. Now, in room_1, I need to drop the purple_ball_1 before I can pick up the blue box. But the goal is to be holding the blue box in room_1. So I need to drop the purple_ball_1 in room_1, then pick up the blue box. But that requires two steps. Let's adjust the plan:

After entering room_1 (step 9 in the previous plan), I'm holding purple_ball_1. Then:

10. drop purple_ball_1 room_1
11. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1
12. pick blue_box_1 room_1

But dropping requires being in front of an empty position. So after entering room_1, I need to gotoempty first to drop the ball.

Wait, the drop action's preconditions are: (i) holding x, (ii) the position in front is empty. But when you enter a room via gotoroom, you are no longer in front of anything. So after step 9 (gotoroom room_3 to room_1), I'm in room_1, not in front of any object. So to drop the purple_ball_1, I can do:

10. gotoempty (since you can always do that)
11. drop purple_ball_1 room_1 (now it's in room_1)
12. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1
13. pick blue_box_1 room_1

But this adds more steps. Also, the fourth constraint is already satisfied in step 3, so dropping the purple_ball_1 later doesn't affect that. But the goal is to be holding the blue box in room_1, which is achieved.

But this plan is getting longer. Let's check if there's a more optimal path. Maybe instead of picking up purple_ball_1 early, can I handle the constraints in a different way?

Wait, the fourth constraint requires a state where I'm holding purple_ball_1 and in front of blue_ball_2. So I have to do that at least once. So I need to pick up purple_ball_1 in room_4, go to blue_ball_2's position (which is in room_4), then proceed. Then I need to drop it somewhere else before I can pick up the blue box. Alternatively, maybe I can drop it in room_4 after satisfying the constraint.

But how? Let's think:

1. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4
2. pick purple_ball_1 room_4
3. gotoobject blue_ball_2 room_4 (now holding purple_ball_1 and in front of blue_ball_2 → satisfies constraints 3 and 4)
4. drop purple_ball_1 room_4 (now free to pick up other objects)
5. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3
6. toggle grey_door_1
7. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1
8. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_1
9. toggle purple_door_1
10. gotoroom room_3 room_1 purple_door_1
11. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1
12. pick blue_box_1 room_1

This way, after step 3, I satisfy constraints 3 and 4. Then I drop the ball in step 4, which frees my hands. Then proceed to unlock doors and go to room_1. This might be shorter.

But wait, in step 4, after dropping the purple_ball_1 in room_4, does that affect any constraints? The third constraint is satisfied by step 3 (in front of blue_ball_2). The fourth is satisfied in step 3 (holding and in front of). So dropping it later is okay.

This plan has 12 steps, but maybe can be optimized. Let's count:

1. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4
2. pick
3. gotoobject blue_ball_2 room_4
4. drop
5. gotodoor grey_door_1
6. toggle
7. gotoroom to 3
8. gotodoor purple_door_1
9. toggle
10. gotoroom to 1
11. gotoobject box
12. pick

But the problem is, after step 4, you are in front of blue_ball_2 and drop the purple_ball_1 there. Then you need to go to the grey_door_1. So step 5 would be gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3. But after dropping, you're in front of purple_ball_1 (since drop action puts you in front of x). Wait, no. The effect of drop is: (i) no longer carrying x, (ii) in front of x, (iii) x is in the current room. So after step 4, after dropping, you are in front of purple_ball_1 (which is now in room_4). So to go to the door, you need to leave that position. So after step 4:

5. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3 (but if you're in front of purple_ball_1, you need to first move to the door. So maybe after step 4, you need to do gotoempty or goto door.

Wait, after step 3, you're in front of blue_ball_2. Then step 4: drop purple_ball_1 room_4. But you can only drop if the position in front of you is empty. Wait, when you're in front of blue_ball_2, can you drop the purple_ball_1 there? Because the position is occupied by blue_ball_2. So no. The drop action requires that the position in front is empty. So in step 3, you're in front of blue_ball_2. Then you can't drop the purple_ball_1 there because the position is occupied. So you need to go to an empty position first.

Ah, right. So after step 3 (holding purple_ball_1 and in front of blue_ball_2), to drop it, you need to be in front of an empty position. So after step 3:

4. gotoempty (now in front of empty)
5. drop purple_ball_1 room_4
6. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3
7. toggle grey_door_1
8. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1
9. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_1
10. toggle purple_door_1
11. gotoroom room_3 room_1 purple_door_1
12. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1
13. pick blue_box_1 room_1

This adds another step. Now the plan is longer. So the previous approach where we take the purple_ball_1 to room_1 and drop it there might be longer, but perhaps necessary.

Alternatively, after step 3 (in front of blue_ball_2, holding purple_ball_1), can we gotoempty in room_4, drop the purple_ball_1 there, then proceed? Let's try:

1. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4
2. pick purple_ball_1 room_4
3. gotoempty room_4 (since you can't drop in front of blue_ball_2)
4. drop purple_ball_1 room_4 (now in front of purple_ball_1)
5. gotoobject blue_ball_2 room_4 (now in front of blue_ball_2, not holding anything → this doesn't satisfy constraint 4)
Oh wait, because constraint 4 requires holding purple_ball_1 and in front of blue_ball_2. So if I drop it, then I'm no longer holding it. So this approach doesn't work.

So the only way to satisfy constraint 4 is to have a state where I'm holding purple_ball_1 and in front of blue_ball_2. So steps must include:

- goto purple_ball_1, pick it up, then goto blue_ball_2 while still holding it.

Then, after that, I need to drop it somewhere else. But in order to drop, I need to be in front of an empty position. So after step 3 (in front of blue_ball_2, holding purple_ball_1), I need to go to an empty spot, drop it, then proceed.

So steps:

1. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4
2. pick purple_ball_1 room_4
3. gotoobject blue_ball_2 room_4 (now in front of blue_ball_2, holding purple_ball_1 → satisfies constraint 4)
4. gotoempty room_4
5. drop purple_ball_1 room_4 (now free)
6. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3
7. toggle grey_door_1 (unlock)
8. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1
9. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_1
10. toggle purple_door_1 (unlock)
11. gotoroom room_3 room_1 purple_door_1
12. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1
13. pick blue_box_1 room_1

This plan satisfies all constraints:

- Being in room_1 (step 11).
- Before entering room_1 (step 11), grey_door_1 was unlocked in step 7.
- In step 3, in front of blue_ball_2 (satisfies constraint 3).
- In step 3, holding purple_ball_1 and in front of blue_ball_2 (satisfies constraint 4).

But is this the shortest possible? Let's see if any steps can be optimized.

Wait, after step 3, I'm in front of blue_ball_2, holding purple_ball_1. Then step 4: gotoempty. Then step 5: drop. Then step 6: gotodoor. Can steps 4 and 6 be combined? For example, instead of going to empty, then going to the door, maybe directly go to the door after dropping. But to go to the door, you need to perform gotodoor, which requires being in the same room and the door's position not blocked.

After step 5, I'm in front of purple_ball_1. To go to the door, I need to leave that position. So step 6 would be gotodoor grey_door_1. But since I'm in room_4, I can do that. So perhaps steps 4 and 5 can be skipped if I can drop the ball while in front of the door.

But no, because the drop action requires being in front of an empty position. If I'm in front of blue_ball_2 (step 3), I can't drop there. So I must gotoempty first, then drop. So steps 4 and 5 are necessary.

Alternatively, after step 3 (in front of blue_ball_2, holding purple_ball_1), perhaps I can go to the door directly? But to go to the door, I need to leave the current position. So step 4 would be gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3. But can I do that while holding the ball? Yes. But when you do gotodoor, you leave the current front position. Then you are in front of the door. Then you can drop the ball in front of the door if it's empty. Wait, but if I'm in front of the door, can I drop the ball there? Yes, as long as the position is empty. But initially, the door's position in room_4 is not blocked. So after step 3:

4. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3 (now in front of the door)
5. drop purple_ball_1 room_4 (now in front of the door, which is allowed if the door's front position was empty. Wait, but after going to the door, the position in front of the door is where you are. When you drop, you place the purple_ball_1 there. So the door's front position is now blocked by the ball. But then, when trying to go through the door, you need to have the door's front position unblocked. So after step 5, the door's position in room_4 is blocked by the purple_ball_1, making it impossible to use the door.

That's a problem. Because when you try to go to room_3 (step 8?), you need to be in front of the door, but if the door is blocked by the purple_ball_1, you can't go through. So this approach would fail.

Therefore, the correct way is to drop the ball in an empty position, not in front of the door.

Thus, steps 4 and 5 are necessary to drop the ball in an empty spot. So the plan is as follows:

1. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4
2. pick purple_ball_1 room_4
3. gotoobject blue_ball_2 room_4
4. gotoempty room_4
5. drop purple_ball_1 room_4
6. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3
7. toggle grey_door_1
8. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1
9. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_1
10. toggle purple_door_1
11. gotoroom room_3 room_1 purple_door_1
12. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1
13. pick blue_box_1 room_1

This is 13 steps. Is there a way to shorten it?

Wait, after step 3, I'm in front of blue_ball_2, holding purple_ball_1. Then, instead of going to empty, can I just drop the ball there? No, because the position is occupied by blue_ball_2. So no. Must gotoempty.

Alternative idea: After step 2 (picking up purple_ball_1), go to the door directly, then drop it there. Let's see:

1. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4
2. pick purple_ball_1 room_4
3. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3
4. drop purple_ball_1 room_4 (can't drop here unless the position is empty. But after step 3, I'm in front of the door. If the door's position is empty, then yes. So drop here.
5. toggle grey_door_1
6. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1
7. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_1
8. toggle purple_door_1
9. gotoroom room_3 room_1 purple_door_1
10. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1
11. pick blue_box_1 room_1

But does this satisfy the constraints? Let's check:

- Constraint 4: must be holding purple_ball_1 and in front of blue_ball_2. In this plan, I never go to blue_ball_2 after picking up purple_ball_1. So this plan doesn't satisfy constraint 4. So invalid.

Thus, the earlier plan with 13 steps is necessary.

Another optimization: Can I combine the drop and some other action? For example, after step 5 (dropping purple_ball_1), maybe I can go directly to the door. But after dropping, you're in front of the purple_ball_1. So you need to leave that position to go to the door. So:

5. drop purple_ball_1 room_4 (now in front of it)
6. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3 (leaves front of purple_ball_1, goes to door)
7. toggle
8. gotoroom to room_3
...

But this would require step 6 after dropping. Which is the same as the original plan. So steps 6-13 would proceed as before. So the number of steps remains the same.

Alternatively, after step 5 (drop), can I gotoempty again and then goto door? No, that adds more steps.

Hmm. It seems that the 13-step plan is necessary. But maybe there's a shorter way. Let's think differently.

The third constraint requires that in at least one state, either grey_ball_1 is in room_2 or I'm in front of blue_ball_2. The first part (grey_ball_1 in room_2) could be achieved by moving it, but that requires picking it up and dropping it in room_2. But grey_ball_1 is initially in room_3. To move it, I'd have to go to room_3, pick it up, then take it to room_2. But that would add many steps. So it's easier to just be in front of blue_ball_2, which is already in room_4.

So the third constraint is satisfied by being in front of blue_ball_2, which happens in step 3 of the original plan.

Thus, the original plan with 13 steps is valid and meets all constraints. But is it optimal? The problem states to provide an optimal plan with minimal steps.

Wait, let's recount the steps in the initial plan:

1. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4
2. pick purple_ball_1 room_4
3. gotoobject blue_ball_2 room_4 (constraint 4 met here)
4. gotoempty room_4
5. drop purple_ball_1 room_4
6. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3
7. toggle grey_door_1
8. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1
9. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_1
10. toggle purple_door_1
11. gotoroom room_3 room_1 purple_door_1
12. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1
13. pick blue_box_1 room_1

But maybe some steps can be merged. For example, after step 3, when you're in front of blue_ball_2, can you go directly to the door without going to empty? No, because to drop, you need to be in front of empty. So steps 4 and 5 are necessary.

Alternatively, after step 3, can you go to the door directly while holding the ball, then drop it there, but ensuring the door's position is not blocked. But as discussed earlier, dropping at the door would block it, making it impossible to use. So that's not feasible.

Another idea: After step 5, when you drop the ball, you're in front of it. To go to the door, you need to leave that position. So step 6: gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3. Then proceed. So steps 6-13 are necessary.

Is there any way to avoid going to room_3? For example, can I use another path to room_1?

Alternatively, starting from room_4, unlock purple_door_2 (connecting room_2 and 4), but that's locked. But that's not on the path to room_1. Or unlock yellow_door_1 via room_2. But how?

But the constraint requires that grey_door_1 must be unlocked before entering room_1. So even if I take another path, I must have unlocked grey_door_1 earlier. For example, if I go from room_4 to room_2 via purple_door_2, but that's locked. So I need to unlock purple_door_2. But that's not connected to grey_door_1. This seems more complicated.

Alternatively, unlock grey_door_1, go to room_3, unlock purple_door_1, go to room_1. That's the path we're taking.

So I think the initial plan is the shortest possible. So the final answer is:

```
gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4
pick purple_ball_1 room_4
gotoobject blue_ball_2 room_4
gotoempty room_4
drop purple_ball_1 room_4
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3
toggle grey_door_1
gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_1
toggle purple_door_1
gotoroom room_3 room_1 purple_door_1
gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1
pick blue_box_1 room_1
```

But wait, step 11 is gotoroom room_3 room_1 purple_door_1. After that, I'm in room_1. Then step 12: gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1. Then step 13: pick. That's correct.

But let's check if all preconditions are met:

- When picking blue_box_1, I'm in room_1 and not holding anything. After dropping purple_ball_1 in step 5, I'm free. Then steps 6-11: after dropping, I'm not holding anything, so can proceed.

Yes. So this plan is valid and meets all constraints.
