Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. The goal is to have a purple ball in front of me. Let me start by understanding the initial state and the constraints.

First, the initial state: I'm in room_2. There's a purple_ball_1 in room_1, and purple_ball_2 in room_3. The doors are all locked. The constraints say that yellow_door_1 must always stay locked. Also, I need to be in room_2 at some point, and if I'm in room_2, I must either be holding something or in front of yellow_door_2 either then or later. Plus, I need to either be in front of green_ball_1 or have green_door_1 unlocked at some point.

So the goal is to have a purple ball in front of me. The purple balls are in room_1 and room_3. Since I'm starting in room_2, maybe going to room_3 via room_4? Let's see the doors. From room_2, the doors are yellow_door_1 to room_1 (but must stay locked) and yellow_door_2 to room_4. Room_4 connects to room_3 via green_door_1. All doors are locked initially.

First step: unlock doors. But the toggle action requires being in front of the door. To get to a door, I need to go to it, but doors might be blocked by objects. Wait, the preconditions for "goto door" say that there's no object blocking the position in front of the door in the current room. So I need to check if any doors are blocked.

In room_2, the doors are yellow_door_1 (to room_1) and yellow_door_2 (to room_4). Are there objects blocking their positions? The initial state says purple_box_1, green_ball_1, and green_ball_2 are in room_2. If any of these are in front of a door, then I can't go to the door until they're moved.

But how do objects block doors? The problem says that when you pick up an object, if it was blocking a door, it's no longer blocking. So perhaps the presence of an object in the room may block the door's position if it's in front of it. But the initial state doesn't mention any objects blocking doors. Wait, the problem statement doesn't specify which objects are blocking which doors. Hmm, maybe the initial state doesn't have any doors blocked by objects. So maybe the doors are not blocked initially. Let me check the initial state again. The original state lists the objects in each room but doesn't mention any blocking. So perhaps the doors are not blocked. So I can go to the doors.

So starting in room_2, I can go to yellow_door_2 (connecting to room_4). But it's locked. So I need to toggle it. To toggle, I need to be in front of it. So action sequence:

1. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_2 room_4 (precondition: in room_2, which I am, and no object blocking. Assuming that's okay.)
2. toggle yellow_door_2 (since I'm in front of it now)
This unlocks yellow_door_2. Then, I can go to room_4.

3. gotoroom room_2 room_4 yellow_door_2 (now in room_4)
Then, in room_4, I need to go to green_door_1 (connecting to room_3). But green_door_1 is locked. So:

4. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3 (assuming room_4 has green_door_1 connected to room_3)
5. toggle green_door_1 (unlock it)
Then go to room_3.

6. gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1 (now in room_3)
In room_3, there's grey_ball_1 and purple_ball_2. I need to get to purple_ball_2.

7. gotoobject purple_ball_2 room_3
8. pick purple_ball_2 room_3 (since I'm not holding anything)
Then, I need to bring it back to where I can drop it in front of myself. But the goal is to be in front of a purple ball. So if I pick it up, then drop it, I can be in front of it. Wait, after dropping, the effect is that I'm in front of it. So perhaps after picking it up, I can drop it again, but where?

Wait, the goal is "there is a ball v such that v is purple and you are in front of v." So I just need to be in front of any purple ball. The ball could be in any room. But if I pick up purple_ball_2 in room_3, I can carry it to another room and drop it, then go in front of it. But maybe it's easier to drop it in room_3 and then be in front of it again. Let me think.

Alternatively, maybe I can drop it in room_3, then immediately be in front of it. But after dropping, I'm in front of it. Wait, the drop action's effect is that after dropping, you are in front of x. So when you drop the ball, you are in front of it. So if I drop it, then I'm already in front of it. So maybe the plan is to pick up a purple ball, then drop it, and that's it. Wait, but the initial state has purple_ball_1 in room_1 and purple_ball_2 in room_3. If I can get to either of those, pick up, drop, and then be in front of it.

But let's see. Starting in room_2, the path to room_1 is via yellow_door_1, but that door must stay locked. So I can't go through yellow_door_1. So the only way to get to room_1 is if there's another door, but according to the initial connections, room_1 is connected to room_2 via yellow_door_1 and to room_3 via red_door_1. So to get to room_1, I need to go through red_door_1 from room_3. But room_3 is connected to room_4 via green_door_1, which I can unlock. But to get to room_3, I need to go through room_4.

Alternatively, let's focus on the purple_ball_2 in room_3. So the steps would be:

Go from room_2 to room_4 via yellow_door_2 (after unlocking it), then to room_3 via green_door_1 (after unlocking it). Then, pick up purple_ball_2, drop it (which puts me in front of it), and that's the goal.

Wait, but after dropping, I'm in front of the ball. So if I pick it up and drop it, then the goal is achieved. So the plan could be:

1. Unlock yellow_door_2 (requires going to it from room_2)
2. Go through yellow_door_2 to room_4
3. Unlock green_door_1 (go to it in room_4)
4. Go through green_door_1 to room_3
5. Go to purple_ball_2 in room_3
6. Pick it up
7. Drop it (this puts me in front of it, so the goal is achieved)

But wait, when you drop the ball, you are in front of it. So step 7 would achieve the goal. But also, after dropping, the ball is in room_3. So the final state would have me in front of purple_ball_2 in room_3.

But does that satisfy all constraints?

Constraints:

- The first constraint: yellow_door_1 must always be locked. Since we never interact with it, that's okay.

- Second constraint: must be in room_2 at least once. Initial state says we are in room_2 and have visited it. But after moving to room_4, we leave room_2. Do we need to return to room_2 at some point? The problem's initial state already includes "you have visited room_2", but the constraint is that "you are in room_2" must hold in at least one state. The initial state is room_2, so that's already satisfied. Wait, the initial state is a state where you are in room_2. So that constraint is already met. So as long as we don't violate that, but the plan doesn't require us to be in room_2 again unless necessary. So that's okay.

Third constraint: If you are in room_2 in some state s, then either you are holding an object or in front of yellow_door_2 at s or after. The initial state is in room_2, not holding anything and not in front of yellow_door_2. So we need to ensure that after the initial state, either we pick up something in room_2 or go to yellow_door_2. But since the initial state is the starting point, perhaps the constraint applies to any state where we are in room_2. So in the initial state, we are in room_2, not holding anything and not in front of yellow_door_2. So we must, in the plan, either in the initial state or after, when in room_2, have either holding something or be in front of yellow_door_2. Since the initial state is part of the plan, but the plan starts with actions. Wait, the initial state is before any actions are taken. So the initial state is s0. The first action is s0 -> s1. So in s0, the agent is in room_2, not holding anything, and not in front of yellow_door_2. So according to the constraint, if in any state s (including s0) the agent is in room_2, then in s or some state after, the agent must be holding something or in front of yellow_door_2. So in s0, the agent is in room_2. Therefore, in s0 or some subsequent state, the agent must hold something or be in front of yellow_door_2. Since the initial state is s0, the constraint is triggered here. To satisfy this, either in s0 (which isn't possible, since the agent isn't holding anything and isn't in front of the door) or in some future state. So the plan must include either picking up an object in room_2 (before leaving) or going to yellow_door_2 in room_2. Let's look at the plan steps I considered earlier. The first action would be gotodoor yellow_door_2. So in room_2, the agent goes to yellow_door_2. So after that action, the agent is in front of yellow_door_2. So in state s1, after the first action, the agent is in front of yellow_door_2 in room_2. So the constraint is satisfied because in s0 (room_2, not holding or in front), but in s1, the agent is in front of yellow_door_2, which is after s0. So that's okay.

Fourth constraint: At least one state must have either in front of green_ball_1 or green_door_1 unlocked. So the plan needs to include either unlocking green_door_1 or being in front of green_ball_1. The plan I'm considering unlocks green_door_1 when in room_4, so that would satisfy the "green_door_1 is not locked" part. So that's covered.

So the steps would be:

1. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_2 room_4 (now in front of yellow_door_2, satisfying the constraint)
2. toggle yellow_door_2 (unlock it)
3. gotoroom room_2 room_4 yellow_door_2 (now in room_4)
4. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3
5. toggle green_door_1 (unlock it)
6. gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1 (now in room_3)
7. gotoobject purple_ball_2 room_3
8. pick purple_ball_2 room_3
9. drop purple_ball_2 room_3 (after dropping, you're in front of it, achieving the goal)

But wait, after step 9, the goal is achieved. Let's check the preconditions for each action.

Step 1: gotodoor yellow_door_2 in room_2. The agent is in room_2, which is connected via yellow_door_2. Assuming no objects are blocking the door's position, which the initial state doesn't mention, so allowed. So step 1 is okay.

Step 2: toggle yellow_door_2. Must be in front of it. Yes, after step 1, the agent is in front of it. So toggle unlocks it.

Step 3: gotoroom room_2 to room_4 via yellow_door_2, which is now unlocked. Correct.

Step 4: gotodoor green_door_1 in room_4. Since room_4 is connected to room_3 via green_door_1, and assuming no object blocking, allowed.

Step 5: toggle green_door_1 (unlocks it)

Step 6: go to room_3 via green_door_1 (now unlocked)

Step 7: gotoobject purple_ball_2 in room_3. Agent is in room_3, so allowed.

Step 8: pick up purple_ball_2. Hands are empty, in same room.

Step 9: drop purple_ball_2. Since holding it, drop. After dropping, in front of it. Goal achieved.

Now check constraints:

- All states: yellow_door_1 remains locked. We never toggled it, so yes.

- At least one state in room_2: initial state s0, which is okay.

- For any state in room_2, after that state, hold something or be in front of yellow_door_2. The agent leaves room_2 in step 3. So in s0 (room_2), the next state s1 (in front of yellow_door_2 in room_2) satisfies the requirement.

- At least one state where in front of green_ball_1 or green_door_1 unlocked. Step 5 unlocks green_door_1, so that's covered.

So this plan seems valid. Let me check if there's a shorter plan.

Alternative approach: Can I get to purple_ball_1 in room_1? But to get to room_1, I need to go through red_door_1 from room_3. But room_1 is connected to room_3 via red_door_1. So to get to room_1, I need to unlock red_door_1. But that door is locked. So:

From room_3, go to red_door_1 (which connects to room_1), but red_door_1 is in room_3? Or in room_1? Wait, the initial state says room_1 and room_3 are connected via red_door_1. So red_door_1 is in room_1 and room_3. So in room_3, I can go to red_door_1. But it's locked. To unlock it, I need to toggle it, which requires being in front of it. Then go through to room_1. But if I do that, then I can get purple_ball_1. However, the initial constraint says that yellow_door_1 must remain locked. But if I go through red_door_1, that's allowed. However, getting to room_3 would still require going through room_4 and unlocking green_door_1. So maybe the steps would be longer. So the previous plan seems better.

Another alternative: Maybe use the box in room_2 (purple_box_1). But the goal requires a ball, so the box isn't relevant. Unless moving the box is needed to unblock a door. Wait, the initial state doesn't mention any doors being blocked. So maybe the doors are unblocked. So the initial plan is valid.

Is there a way to achieve the goal without going to room_3? For example, getting purple_ball_1 from room_1. But to reach room_1 from room_2, the only door is yellow_door_1, which must stay locked. So that's impossible. Hence, the only way is to get to room_3 and then handle purple_ball_2.

Thus, the initial plan is the shortest possible. Let me count the steps: 9 actions. Is there a way to shorten it?

Wait, after dropping the ball in step 9, the agent is in front of it. So the goal is achieved. The steps are:

1. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_2 room_4
2. toggle yellow_door_2
3. gotoroom room_2 room_4 yellow_door_2
4. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3
5. toggle green_door_1
6. gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1
7. gotoobject purple_ball_2 room_3
8. pick purple_ball_2 room_3
9. drop purple_ball_2 room_3

Wait, but after step 8, the agent is holding the ball. Then, step 9 drops it, which puts the agent in front of it. So the goal is achieved in step 9. That's 9 steps. Is there a way to do it in fewer steps?

Wait, perhaps after step 6 (arriving in room_3), the agent is in room_3 and not in front of anything. Then, step 7 is gotoobject purple_ball_2. Then pick and drop. So that's three steps in room_3. But can I combine any steps?

Alternatively, when the agent is in room_3 after step 6, maybe they can immediately go to purple_ball_2 and pick it up. So steps 7,8,9 are necessary. So total steps are 9.

Alternatively, maybe when dropping, the agent is already in front of the ball, so maybe after picking it up, they can drop it immediately. But the drop action requires that the position in front is empty. But when you pick up the ball, you are no longer in front of it. So after picking up, you need to go to an empty spot to drop. Wait, no. The effects of pick: (i) no longer in front of x, (ii) hands not empty, (iii) carrying x, (iv) x no longer in the room. Then, to drop, you need to be in front of an empty spot. So after picking up, you need to gotoempty to get to an empty position, then drop. But that would add steps. Wait, but the drop action's preconditions: (i) holding x, (ii) the position in front is empty. But after picking up, the agent is not in front of anything. So to drop, they need to be in front of an empty position.

Wait, the drop action's effect is that after dropping, you are in front of x. So when you drop, you must be in a position where the drop can occur. So perhaps the steps after picking up would be:

After step 8 (holding purple_ball_2), the agent is in room_3, not in front of anything. To drop, they need to be in front of an empty position. So:

8. pick purple_ball_2 room_3
9. gotoempty (moves to an empty spot)
10. drop purple_ball_2 room_3

But then the agent is in front of the ball after dropping. But that adds an extra step. Wait, no. Because after picking up, the agent is no longer in front of any object. So to drop, they need to be in front of an empty position. So the sequence would be:

After picking up, go to empty, then drop. So two more steps. But this would make the plan longer. Wait, but the problem says that when you drop, you can drop it in the room you're in. The drop action's preconditions are that you are holding x and the position in front is empty. But after picking up, the agent is not in front of anything. So they need to first go to an empty position (gotoempty), then drop. So that's an extra step. But in my initial plan, I didn't consider this. So my initial plan is invalid.

Oh no! This is a mistake. Let me re-examine the drop action's preconditions. The "drop x r" action requires that you are holding x and the position in front of you is empty. But after picking up an object, the agent is no longer in front of any object (due to the pick effect). So after picking up, the agent is in the same room, but not in front of anything. To drop, they need to be in front of an empty position. So after picking up, the agent must perform "gotoempty" to move to an empty spot, then drop.

So the correct sequence would be:

7. gotoobject purple_ball_2 room_3 (now in front of it)
8. pick purple_ball_2 room_3 (no longer in front, holding it)
9. gotoempty (move to empty spot)
10. drop purple_ball_2 room_3 (now in front of it)

But that adds two steps. So total steps would be 10. But wait, when you drop, you can drop it in the current room. The drop effect says that after dropping, the object is in the current room and you are in front of it. So the position where you drop it must be empty. So the agent must be in front of an empty spot to drop. Hence, after picking up, the agent must go to an empty spot, then drop.

So the initial plan was missing steps. Therefore, the correct plan would have:

After step 8 (pick), gotoempty, then drop. So steps 9 and 10.

But wait, the agent is in room_3. After picking up the ball, they are in room_3, not in front of anything. Then, they need to go to an empty spot (step 9: gotoempty), then drop (step 10). So the total steps become 10.

But is there a way to avoid the gotoempty step? For example, after picking up, can the agent immediately drop? No, because the agent is not in front of an empty position. The drop action requires that the position in front is empty. So after picking up, the agent is not in front of any position (they moved away from the object's position when picking up). So they need to go to an empty spot to drop.

Alternatively, maybe after picking up, the agent can go back to the door, which is now unblocked. But that might not help.

So the corrected plan would be:

1. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_2 room_4
2. toggle yellow_door_2
3. gotoroom room_2 room_4 yellow_door_2
4. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3
5. toggle green_door_1
6. gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1
7. gotoobject purple_ball_2 room_3
8. pick purple_ball_2 room_3
9. gotoempty
10. drop purple_ball_2 room_3

But this is 10 steps. Is there a shorter way?

Alternatively, after step 6 (in room_3), can the agent immediately pick up the ball? No, because they need to be in front of it. So steps 7 and 8 are necessary. Then steps 9 and 10.

Alternatively, after step 6, the agent is in room_3, not in front of anything. So they need to go to the ball (step 7), pick (step 8), then gotoempty (step9), drop (step10). So that's four steps in room_3.

Is there a way to optimize? For example, after step 6, the agent is in room_3. What if they use "gotoempty" instead of gotoobject? Then they could drop the ball there. But they need to pick up the ball first. So maybe:

After step 6, in room_3:

7. gotoempty (now in front of empty)
8. gotoobject purple_ball_2 room_3 (now in front of it)
9. pick
10. gotoempty
11. drop

No, that's even longer.

Alternatively, after step 6, can the agent go to the door again? Not sure. Let me think.

Another approach: Maybe after unlocking green_door_1 and entering room_3, the agent can drop the ball in room_4, but that's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps the agent can drop the ball in room_3 immediately after picking it up, but that requires being in front of an empty spot.

Wait, maybe in room_3, there's an empty spot. So after picking up the ball, the agent can go to an empty spot (step9), then drop (step10). So that's necessary.

Thus, the plan must have 10 steps. But wait, maybe when the agent is in room_3 after step6, they can go to the ball, pick it up, then drop it in the same spot. But after picking up, the ball is no longer there, so the spot is empty. So:

After step7: gotoobject purple_ball_2 (now in front of it)
step8: pick (now holding it, no longer in front of it)
step9: drop purple_ball_2 (can't do this because you're not in front of an empty spot. You're in front of where the ball was, which is now empty? Wait, when you pick up the ball, the ball is removed from the room, so the spot where it was is now empty. So after picking up, the agent is no longer in front of anything. But the spot where the ball was is now empty. So if the agent can go back to that spot (which is now empty), they can drop the ball there.

But how? The agent was in front of the ball in step7. Then, after picking up, they are no longer in front of it. The spot where the ball was is now empty. So the agent can use "gotoempty" to go to that spot, then drop.

But how does "gotoempty" work? The action "gotoempty" allows the agent to go to any empty position in the current room. So after step8, the agent is in room_3, not in front of anything. The spot where the ball was is now empty. So the agent can use "gotoempty" to go to that spot. Then, drop the ball there, which would place it back in that spot, and the agent is now in front of it.

So steps:

7. gotoobject purple_ball_2 room_3
8. pick purple_ball_2 room_3
9. gotoempty (moves to the spot where the ball was, now empty)
10. drop purple_ball_2 room_3

This way, steps 9 and 10 are necessary. But is "gotoempty" deterministic in choosing the same spot? The problem says "gotoempty" goes to an empty position, which could be any. But perhaps if there's only one empty spot (the one where the ball was), then it's possible. However, rooms likely have multiple empty spots. But the agent can choose any. So in this case, after picking up, the spot where the ball was is empty. So the agent can use "gotoempty" to go there, then drop. But how to ensure that?

The problem doesn't specify that the agent needs to track positions. So perhaps we can assume that after picking up the ball, the agent can use "gotoempty" to return to the same spot. So steps 9 and 10 would work.

Thus, the plan remains 10 steps.

But is there a shorter way? Let me think again.

Wait, after step6 (in room_3), the agent can go to the ball (step7), pick it (step8), then immediately drop it. But no, because after picking, the agent is not in front of an empty spot. So they need to gotoempty first.

Alternatively, perhaps after picking up the ball, the agent can perform "gotoempty" and then drop. But that's two steps. So no way around it.

So the plan is 10 steps. But let's check if the initial plan (missing these steps) was incorrect. The initial plan assumed that after picking up, the agent can drop immediately, but that's not possible. So the corrected plan must include gotoempty and drop.

But wait, the drop action's precondition is that the position in front is empty. After picking up, the agent is not in front of any position. So they need to go to an empty position (using gotoempty) to be in front of it, then drop.

Thus, the correct plan must have 10 steps. Therefore, the initial plan was wrong, and the correct plan is longer.

Now, let's re-express the plan with the corrected steps.

Action sequence:

1. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_2 room_4
2. toggle yellow_door_2
3. gotoroom room_2 room_4 yellow_door_2
4. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3
5. toggle green_door_1
6. gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1
7. gotoobject purple_ball_2 room_3
8. pick purple_ball_2 room_3
9. gotoempty
10. drop purple_ball_2 room_3

Now, check all constraints and preconditions.

Step 1: gotodoor yellow_door_2 in room_2. Precondition: in room_2 and no object blocking. Correct.

Step 2: toggle yellow_door_2. Now unlocked.

Step3: go to room_4. Door is unlocked.

Step4: gotodoor green_door_1 in room_4. Precondition met.

Step5: toggle green_door_1. Now unlocked.

Step6: go to room_3.

Step7: gotoobject purple_ball_2 in room_3. Correct.

Step8: pick up. Correct.

Step9: gotoempty in room_3. Correct.

Step10: drop. Now in front of purple_ball_2. Goal achieved.

This satisfies all constraints. The only question is the fourth constraint: at least one state where either in front of green_ball_1 or green_door_1 is unlocked. In step5, we unlock green_door_1, so that's covered.

Yes. Thus, this is a valid plan. Now, is there a shorter plan? Let's see.

Alternative plan: If there's a purple ball in room_1, but we can't reach it due to locked yellow_door_1. So no. Must use room_3.

Another alternative: Can we unlock green_door_1 from room_3? No, because green_door_1 connects room_4 and room_3. To toggle it, the agent must be in front of it in room_4 or room_3. So when the agent is in room_4, they can go to green_door_1 and toggle it. But the agent needs to go from room_2 to room_4, unlock yellow_door_2, then go to room_4, unlock green_door_1, then go to room_3. So that's necessary.

Thus, the plan of 10 steps seems to be the minimal.
