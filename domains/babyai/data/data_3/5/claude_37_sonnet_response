Alright, let's break down the problem:

### Environment
- 4 rooms arranged in a square: room_1 (NW), room_2 (SW), room_3 (NE), room_4 (SE).
- Doors connect: room_1-room_2, room_1-room_3, room_2-room_4, room_3-room_4.
- Objects: boxes and balls, each with a color.
- Doors also have colors.

### Initial State
- You're in room_2.
- purple_ball_1 in room_1
- purple_box_1, green_ball_1, green_ball_2 in room_2
- grey_ball_1, purple_ball_2 in room_3
- yellow_box_1, yellow_ball_1 in room_4
- All doors are locked
- You're not holding anything

### Goal
- Be in front of a purple ball

### Constraints
1. yellow_door_1 must remain locked at all times.
2. At some point, you must be in room_2 (satisfied initially).
3. If you're in room_2, you must either hold an object or be in front of yellow_door_2 at that point or later.
4. At some point, you must either be in front of green_ball_1 or have green_door_1 unlocked.

Let's first understand what's available to us.

There are two purple balls:
- purple_ball_1 in room_1
- purple_ball_2 in room_3

So we need to get to either of these rooms to achieve our goal.

Starting from room_2, we could go to:
- room_1 through yellow_door_1
- room_4 through yellow_door_2

But constraint 1 says yellow_door_1 must remain locked. So we can't use that door.

So we need to go to room_4 first (through yellow_door_2) and then to room_3 (through green_door_1). From room_3, we can go to room_1 (through red_door_1) if needed.

Let me also check constraint 3 to ensure we're complying with it. Since we start in room_2, we need to either hold an object or go to yellow_door_2. We'll go to yellow_door_2, so that will satisfy this constraint.

Constraint 4 requires us to either be in front of green_ball_1 or unlock green_door_1. Since green_ball_1 is in room_2 and green_door_1 connects room_3 and room_4, we have the option to either go in front of green_ball_1 before leaving room_2 or unlock green_door_1 when we're trying to get to room_3.

Let me plan the sequence:

1. Go in front of green_ball_1 in room_2 to satisfy constraint 4.
2. Go to the door yellow_door_2 in room_2 to satisfy constraint 3.
3. Unlock yellow_door_2.
4. Go to room_4 using yellow_door_2.
5. Go to the door green_door_1 in room_4.
6. Unlock green_door_1.
7. Go to room_3 using green_door_1.
8. Go in front of purple_ball_2 in room_3 to satisfy the goal.

Let's formalize this plan:

```
gotoobject green_ball_1 room_2
gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_2 room_4
toggle yellow_door_2
gotoroom room_2 room_4 yellow_door_2
gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3
toggle green_door_1
gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1
gotoobject purple_ball_2 room_3
```

Let me go through our constraints to make sure this plan complies:

1. yellow_door_1 remains locked throughout. We're using yellow_door_2, not yellow_door_1.
2. We're initially in room_2, so this constraint is satisfied.
3. When we're in room_2, we go in front of yellow_door_2, so this constraint is satisfied.
4. We go in front of green_ball_1, so this constraint is satisfied.

Let me also check the actions to ensure they're allowed based on the preconditions.

1. `gotoobject green_ball_1 room_2`: 
   - Precondition: We're in the same room as the object. 
   - Status: Satisfied (we're in room_2, and green_ball_1 is in room_2).
   
2. `gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_2 room_4`:
   - Precondition: We're in a room that door connects with another room, and the door isn't blocked.
   - Status: Satisfied (we're in room_2, and yellow_door_2 connects room_2 and room_4. There's no mention of any object blocking the door).
   
3. `toggle yellow_door_2`:
   - Precondition: We're in front of the door.
   - Status: Satisfied (after action 2).
   
4. `gotoroom room_2 room_4 yellow_door_2`:
   - Precondition: We're in a room adjacent to the target room, and the connecting door is unlocked.
   - Status: Satisfied (we've just unlocked yellow_door_2 in action 3).
   
5. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3`:
   - Precondition: We're in a room that door connects with another room, and the door isn't blocked.
   - Status: Satisfied (we're in room_4, and green_door_1 connects room_3 and room_4. No object is blocking the door).
   
6. `toggle green_door_1`:
   - Precondition: We're in front of the door.
   - Status: Satisfied (after action 5).
   
7. `gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1`:
   - Precondition: We're in a room adjacent to the target room, and the connecting door is unlocked.
   - Status: Satisfied (we've just unlocked green_door_1 in action 6).
   
8. `gotoobject purple_ball_2 room_3`:
   - Precondition: We're in the same room as the object.
   - Status: Satisfied (we've just moved to room_3, and purple_ball_2 is in room_3).

It appears that our plan is valid. However, let me check whether there's a shorter path to a purple ball. 

The other purple ball (purple_ball_1) is in room_1. Starting from room_2, we'd need to go through yellow_door_1 to get to room_1. But constraint 1 forbids unlocking yellow_door_1. 

So the shortest path to a purple ball seems to be the one we've already planned.

Wait, let me re-examine the door layout again. According to the problem statement, the doors connect:
- room_1-room_2 via yellow_door_1
- room_1-room_3 via red_door_1
- room_2-room_4 via yellow_door_2
- room_3-room_4 via green_door_1

A possible alternate paths from room_2 to room_3 is:
1. room_2 → room_4 → room_3

And the path from room_2 to room_1 is:
1. room_2 → room_1 (via yellow_door_1)

Since constraint 1 prevents us from unlocking yellow_door_1, we can't take the second path. So the optimal path to a purple ball is indeed the one we've already planned.

Actually, there's another detail I missed. Constraint 3 states:

"If expression 'you are in room_2' holds in some state s, then expression 'At least one of the following conditions is true: "you are holding some object", "you are in front of yellow_door_2"' must hold at s or at some state after s"

This means that after we've been in room_2, we must either be holding an object or in front of yellow_door_2 at some point. So going in front of green_ball_1 isn't sufficient for constraint 3. 

But since our plan already includes going in front of yellow_door_2, we're good to go.

Let me verify this plan once more, action by action:

1. `gotoobject green_ball_1 room_2`: 
   - Precondition: We're in the same room as the object. 
   - Status: Satisfied (we're in room_2, and green_ball_1 is in room_2).
   
2. `gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_2 room_4`:
   - Precondition: We're in a room that door connects with another room, and the door isn't blocked.
   - Status: Satisfied (we're in room_2, and yellow_door_2 connects room_2 and room_4. There's no mention of any object blocking the door).
   
3. `toggle yellow_door_2`:
   - Precondition: We're in front of the door.
   - Status: Satisfied (after action 2).
   
4. `gotoroom room_2 room_4 yellow_door_2`:
   - Precondition: We're in a room adjacent to the target room, and the connecting door is unlocked.
   - Status: Satisfied (we've just unlocked yellow_door_2 in action 3).
   
5. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3`:
   - Precondition: We're in a room that door connects with another room, and the door isn't blocked.
   - Status: Satisfied (we're in room_4, and green_door_1 connects room_3 and room_4. No object is blocking the door).
   
6. `toggle green_door_1`:
   - Precondition: We're in front of the door.
   - Status: Satisfied (after action 5).
   
7. `gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1`:
   - Precondition: We're in a room adjacent to the target room, and the connecting door is unlocked.
   - Status: Satisfied (we've just unlocked green_door_1 in action 6).
   
8. `gotoobject purple_ball_2 room_3`:
   - Precondition: We're in the same room as the object.
   - Status: Satisfied (we've just moved to room_3, and purple_ball_2 is in room_3).

Our plan seems to satisfy all the constraints and provides a path to the goal: being in front of a purple ball. The plan is valid and optimal.

Actually, there's a detail I want to carefully check. The action `gotodoor` has the precondition: "you may only go in front of a door d if ... (ii) there is no object blocking the position in front of d in the room you are currently in." Let me verify that there are no objects blocking the doors we're planning to use.

Based on the initial state, there is no explicit mention of any object blocking any door. So, I'll assume that none of the doors are blocked by objects.

Actually, one more thing to double-check. Let me review all the constraints to ensure our plan is truly compliant:

1. yellow_door_1 must remain locked at all times: Our plan doesn't involve unlocking yellow_door_1, so this is satisfied.
2. At some point, you must be in room_2: We start in room_2, so this is satisfied.
3. If you're in room_2, you must either hold an object or be in front of yellow_door_2 at that point or later: Our plan includes going in front of yellow_door_2, so this is satisfied.
4. At some point, you must either be in front of green_ball_1 or have green_door_1 unlocked: Our plan includes going in front of green_ball_1 and later unlocking green_door_1, so this is satisfied.

I believe our plan is fully compliant with all the constraints, valid in terms of the actions' preconditions and effects, and optimal.

Let's restate the final plan:

```
gotoobject green_ball_1 room_2
gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_2 room_4
toggle yellow_door_2
gotoroom room_2 room_4 yellow_door_2
gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3
toggle green_door_1
gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1
gotoobject purple_ball_2 room_3
```

Wait, let me re-read the constraints to ensure I've understood constraint 3 correctly. Constraint 3 says: "If expression 'you are in room_2' holds in some state s, then expression 'At least one of the following conditions is true: "you are holding some object", "you are in front of yellow_door_2"' must hold at s or at some state after s." This means that after we've been in room_2, we must either be holding an object or in front of yellow_door_2. 

Since we start in room_2, we must ensure that at some point, we either hold an object or go in front of yellow_door_2. Our plan includes going in front of yellow_door_2, so this constraint is satisfied.

Finally, our plan is:

```
gotoobject green_ball_1 room_2
gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_2 room_4
toggle yellow_door_2
gotoroom room_2 room_4 yellow_door_2
gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3
toggle green_door_1
gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1
gotoobject purple_ball_2 room_3
```

Actually, I'm not sure if going in front of green_ball_1 and then immediately going in front of yellow_door_2 satisfies constraint 4. Let me re-read constraint 4: "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'At least one of the following conditions is true: "you are in front of green_ball_1", "green_door_1 is not locked"'."

My previous understanding was correct. Since our plan includes going in front of green_ball_1, constraint 4 is satisfied.

So, our final plan is:

```
gotoobject green_ball_1 room_2
gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_2 room_4
toggle yellow_door_2
gotoroom room_2 room_4 yellow_door_2
gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3
toggle green_door_1
gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1
gotoobject purple_ball_2 room_3
```

I believe this is a valid and optimal plan that satisfies all constraints.

Hmm, one thing that I'm noticing is that constraint 3 says that if we're in room_2, we must either hold an object or be in front of yellow_door_2. Since we're already in room_2 at the start, this constraint is immediately applicable. Let me check if our plan ensures this condition is met at some point.

Our plan includes going to yellow_door_2 in the second step. So the constraint is indeed satisfied.

I think the plan is solid. Let's submit it as our solution.

Actually, let me check if there's a more optimal solution:

The goal is to be in front of a purple ball.
We have two purple balls: purple_ball_1 in room_1 and purple_ball_2 in room_3.

Starting from room_2, the direct paths are:
1. To room_1: Go through yellow_door_1. But constraint 1 prevents unlocking this door, so this path is blocked.
2. To room_3: Go to room_4 via yellow_door_2, then to room_3 via green_door_1. This is the path our plan takes.

There's also a longer path to room_3 from room_2, which is to go to room_1 first, but as I mentioned, that path is blocked due to constraint 1.

So, the path we've chosen seems to be the most direct path to a purple ball, making our plan optimal.

Alright, I confirm the plan I provided is valid, compliant with all constraints, and optimal.

gotoobject green_ball_1 room_2
gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_2 room_4
toggle yellow_door_2
gotoroom room_2 room_4 yellow_door_2
gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3
toggle green_door_1
gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1
gotoobject purple_ball_2 room_3
