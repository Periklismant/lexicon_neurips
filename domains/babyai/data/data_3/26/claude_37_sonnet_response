Alright, let me analyze the problem:

1. I am in room_2.
2. I need to achieve the goal: "There is a door d such that d is grey, you are in front of d, d is not unlocked."
3. The grey door is called grey_door_1, and it connects room_3 and room_4.
4. I need to satisfy several constraints:
   a. In at least one state, "red_door_1 is locked" must hold.
   b. If "red_door_1 is locked" holds, then I must be holding red_ball_1 or be in room_1 at that state or some state after.
   c. In every state, I must not be in room_4.
   d. In at least one state, I must be in front of grey_door_1.
   e. Before being in front of grey_door_1, I must have been holding some object or specifically red_ball_2.

Let's break down the goal: I need to be in front of grey_door_1, which connects room_3 and room_4, and the door should be unlocked. Given the constraint (c), I cannot be in room_4, so I must be in room_3 when I'm in front of grey_door_1.

Let's think about the constraints and how they affect my plan:

1. Given (c), I can never be in room_4. This means I cannot use red_door_1 to go from room_2 to room_4.
2. Given (d) and (e), I must be holding some object (preferably red_ball_2) before I can be in front of grey_door_1.
3. Given (a) and (b), at some point, red_door_1 must be locked, and after that, I should either be holding red_ball_1 or be in room_1.

Let's start planning:

1. I must first move to room_1, going through the locked yellow_door_1.
   - I would need to unlock yellow_door_1.
   - Go to room_1.
   - While there, pick up red_ball_1.

2. Then, I must move to room_3, going through the locked purple_door_1.
   - I would need to unlock purple_door_1.
   - Go to room_3.

3. In room_3, I can pick up red_ball_2 or another object to satisfy constraint (e).

4. At some point, I should ensure red_door_1 is locked (which it already is initially).

5. Finally, I should unlock grey_door_1 while being in room_3.

Hmm, but I see a problem. In the initial state, red_ball_2 is in room_2, not room_3. So I can't pick up red_ball_2 in room_3.

Let me think about the constraint (e) more carefully: "Before being in front of grey_door_1, I must have been holding some object or specifically red_ball_2."

So, I can fulfill this by either holding red_ball_2 or any other object before being in front of grey_door_1.

Let's refine the plan:

1. From room_2, I will pick up either red_ball_2 or another object.
2. I will go to room_1 via yellow_door_1 (after unlocking it).
3. In room_1, I might pick up red_ball_1 (depending on my choices earlier).
4. I will go to room_3 via purple_door_1 (after unlocking it).
5. Once in room_3, I will be in front of grey_door_1 and unlock it.

Let's ensure the plan satisfies all constraints:
- (a) is satisfied because red_door_1 is initially locked.
- (b) is satisfied because I will be in room_1 at some point after red_door_1 is locked.
- (c) is satisfied because I never go to room_4.
- (d) is satisfied because I will be in front of grey_door_1 at the end.
- (e) is satisfied because I will be holding some object (either red_ball_2 or another) before being in front of grey_door_1.

Now, let's detail the specific actions:

1. In room_2, I'll pick up red_ball_2:
   ```
   gotoobject red_ball_2 room_2
   pick red_ball_2 room_2
   ```

2. Then, I'll go to room_1 via yellow_door_1:
   ```
   gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_1
   toggle yellow_door_1
   gotoroom room_2 room_1 yellow_door_1
   ```

3. At this point, I'm in room_1 after red_door_1 was locked, satisfying constraint (b). I'll now go to room_3 via purple_door_1:
   ```
   gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_3
   toggle purple_door_1
   gotoroom room_1 room_3 purple_door_1
   ```

4. Finally, I'll go in front of grey_door_1 and unlock it:
   ```
   gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4
   toggle grey_door_1
   ```

Let's double-check the plan:

```
gotoobject red_ball_2 room_2
pick red_ball_2 room_2
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_1
toggle yellow_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_1 yellow_door_1
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_3
toggle purple_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_3 purple_door_1
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4
toggle grey_door_1
```

Actually, let me be more careful and trace through the execution of the plan to ensure it's valid:

1. Initial state: I am in room_2, all doors are locked, I'm not holding any object.

2. `gotoobject red_ball_2 room_2`
   - Effect: I'm now in front of red_ball_2 in room_2.

3. `pick red_ball_2 room_2`
   - Effect: I'm no longer in front of red_ball_2, my hands are not empty, I'm carrying red_ball_2, red_ball_2 is no longer in room_2.

4. `gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_1`
   - Effect: I'm no longer in front of any object, I'm in front of yellow_door_1 in room_2.

5. `toggle yellow_door_1`
   - Effect: yellow_door_1 is now unlocked.

6. `gotoroom room_2 room_1 yellow_door_1`
   - Effect: I'm no longer in room_2, I'm in room_1, I've visited room_1, I'm no longer in front of yellow_door_1.

7. `gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_3`
   - Effect: I'm in front of purple_door_1 in room_1.

8. `toggle purple_door_1`
   - Effect: purple_door_1 is now unlocked.

9. `gotoroom room_1 room_3 purple_door_1`
   - Effect: I'm no longer in room_1, I'm in room_3, I've visited room_3, I'm no longer in front of purple_door_1.

10. `gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4`
    - Effect: I'm in front of grey_door_1 in room_3.

11. `toggle grey_door_1`
    - Effect: grey_door_1 is now unlocked.

At the end, I'm in room_3, in front of grey_door_1, which is now unlocked. I'm holding red_ball_2. This satisfies the goal: "There is a door d such that d is grey, you are in front of d, d is not locked."

Let's check the constraints again:
- (a) In at least one state, "red_door_1 is locked" holds: Satisfied because red_door_1 is initially locked and remains so.
- (b) If "red_door_1 is locked" holds, then I must be holding red_ball_1 or be in room_1 at that state or some state after: Satisfied because I visit room_1 after red_door_1 is locked.
- (c) In every state, I must not be in room_4: Satisfied because I never enter room_4.
- (d) In at least one state, I must be in front of grey_door_1: Satisfied at step 10.
- (e) Before being in front of grey_door_1, I must have been holding some object or specifically red_ball_2: Satisfied because I'm holding red_ball_2 before being in front of grey_door_1.

Oops, I realize that I misinterpreted the constraint. Let me re-read it:

> "If expression 'you are in front of grey_door_1' holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: 'At least one of the following conditions is true: "you are holding some object", "you are holding red_ball_2"'"

So, I need to be holding some object or specifically red_ball_2 in an earlier state. Since I picked up red_ball_2 in step 3, and I don't drop it, I'm holding it continuously, including when I'm in front of grey_door_1. So constraint (e) is satisfied.

However, I just realized that I've made an mistake: In the initial state, red_ball_2 is in room_2, but I assumed it was in room_3. Let me fix the plan to reflect this:

```
gotoobject red_ball_2 room_2
pick red_ball_2 room_2
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_1
toggle yellow_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_1 yellow_door_1
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_3
toggle purple_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_3 purple_door_1
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4
toggle grey_door_1
```

This is the correct plan. Let's check it one more time:

1. I am in room_2, all doors are locked, I'm not holding any object.
2. I go in front of red_ball_2 in room_2.
3. I pick up red_ball_2.
4. I go in front of yellow_door_1 in room_2.
5. I unlock yellow_door_1.
6. I go to room_1 via yellow_door_1.
7. I go in front of purple_door_1 in room_1.
8. I unlock purple_door_1.
9. I go to room_3 via purple_door_1.
10. I go in front of grey_door_1 in room_3.
11. I unlock grey_door_1.

At the end, I'm in room_3, in front of grey_door_1, which is now unlocked. I'm holding red_ball_2. All constraints are satisfied.

Actually, let me check one more time. The goal of the problem is:

"There is a door d such that "The following conditions are all true: "d is grey", "you are in front of d", "d is not locked"""

So, I need a plan where in the end state, I am in front of the grey door, and the grey door is unlocked. My plan does achieve this, with the end state having me in front of grey_door_1 after unlocking it. So, I'm confident the plan is correct.

However, wait, I think I've been misreading the goal. Let me re-read it:

"There is a door d such that "The following conditions are all true: "d is grey", "you are in front of d", "d is not locked"""

Actually, hold on. I didn't misread it. The goal is to be in front of a grey door that is not locked. The grey door in the domain is grey_door_1, and I need to be in front of it and ensure it's unlocked.

I suspect that when toggle a door, I remain in front of it. So after the toggle action, I'm still in front of the grey door, which is now unlocked. So my plan is valid.

If I'm not sure, I could add an extra step at the end to explicitly go in front of grey_door_1 again after unlocking it, but I believe it's not necessary.

Let's refine the plan one more time:

```
gotoobject red_ball_2 room_2
pick red_ball_2 room_2
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_1
toggle yellow_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_1 yellow_door_1
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_3
toggle purple_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_3 purple_door_1
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4
toggle grey_door_1
```

Actually, looking at the third constraint:
"The following expression must hold in every state: 'you are not in room_4'"

I just want to double-check that the action `gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4` doesn't mean I'm going to room_4. Based on the description, this action only means I'm going in front of the door in room_3, not actually going through it. So I'm still in room_3 after this action.

I think the optimal plan is indeed:

```
gotoobject red_ball_2 room_2
pick red_ball_2 room_2
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_1
toggle yellow_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_1 yellow_door_1
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_3
toggle purple_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_3 purple_door_1
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4
toggle grey_door_1
```

Actually, I may have misunderstood the domain action semantics. Let me reread the action descriptions to ensure I'm correct:

"goto door": After performing this action regarding a door d, (i) if you were in front of some object or door x0, then you are no longer in front of x0 and (ii) you are in front of door d.

"toggle": After performing this action on a door d, (i) if d was locked, then it becomes unlocked, and (ii) if d was unlocked, then it becomes locked.

So, the `gotodoor` action means I'm going in front of the door, not through it. And the `toggle` action changes the state of the door (locked or unlocked).

I think my plan is correct:

```
gotoobject red_ball_2 room_2
pick red_ball_2 room_2
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_1
toggle yellow_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_1 yellow_door_1
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_3
toggle purple_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_3 purple_door_1
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4
toggle grey_door_1
```

Let's check the final state:
- I'm in room_3.
- I'm in front of grey_door_1.
- grey_door_1 is unlocked.
- I'm holding red_ball_2.

This satisfies the goal and all constraints, so I believe this is the optimal plan.

Actually, let's check if we could optimize further. Could we skip going to room_1 entirely? Let's check the constraints:

Constraint (a): In at least one state, "red_door_1 is locked" must hold. This is satisfied because red_door_1 is initially locked.

Constraint (b): If "red_door_1 is locked" holds, then I must be holding red_ball_1 or be in room_1 at that state or some state after. If I don't go to room_1, I'd need to pick up red_ball_1. But red_ball_1 is in room_1, so I'd have to go there anyway. So this constraint can't be bypassed.

Constraint (c): In every state, I must not be in room_4. This is satisfied because I never enter room_4 in my plan.

Constraint (d): In at least one state, I must be in front of grey_door_1. This is satisfied at the end of my plan.

Constraint (e): Before being in front of grey_door_1, I must have been holding some object or specifically red_ball_2. This is satisfied because I'm holding red_ball_2 throughout the plan.

So, based on constraint (b), I can't optimize further by skipping room_1. In fact, the necessity of going to room_1, and then moving to room_3 to eventually be in front of grey_door_1, which is the goal, means this is likely the optimal plan.

I'm confident that the final plan is:

```
gotoobject red_ball_2 room_2
pick red_ball_2 room_2
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_1
toggle yellow_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_1 yellow_door_1
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_3
toggle purple_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_3 purple_door_1
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4
toggle grey_door_1
```

Oh wait, there's actually not quite right. Let's revisit constraint (b) more closely: "If 'red_door_1 is locked' holds in some state s, then 'At least one of the following conditions is true: "you are holding red_ball_1", "you are in room_1"' must hold at s or at some state after s."

In the initial state, red_door_1 is locked. This means I need to either hold red_ball_1 or be in room_1 at some point in the plan. I am in room_1 in the middle of my current plan, so this constraint is already satisfied.

However, there's a shorter option: instead of going all the way to room_1 and then to room_3, I could potentially go to room_1, pick up red_ball_1, and then go back to room_2, and then go directly to room_3.

But I realized there's a problem with that: there isn't a direct connection from room_2 to room_3. The only way to go from room_2 to room_3 is through room_1 or room_4. Since I can't go to room_4 (constraint (c)), the only path is through room_1.

So the original plan does seem optimal. Let's trace and verify:

1. Initial state: I am in room_2. All doors are locked.
2. I go in front of red_ball_2 in room_2.
3. I pick up red_ball_2.
4. I go in front of yellow_door_1 in room_2.
5. I unlock yellow_door_1.
6. I go to room_1 via yellow_door_1. (Note that this satisfies constraint (b))
7. I go in front of purple_door_1 in room_1.
8. I unlock purple_door_1.
9. I go to room_3 via purple_door_1.
10. I go in front of grey_door_1 in room_3.
11. I unlock grey_door_1.

At the end, I'm in room_3, in front of grey_door_1, which is now unlocked. I'm holding red_ball_2. All constraints are satisfied, and I've achieved the goal. This seems to be the optimal plan.

Let's verify that there isn't a shorter path by trying to derive a different plan:

1. From room_2, I pick up red_ball_2 (or any other ball).
2. I need to go to room_3 to be in front of grey_door_1.
3. To go from room_2 to room_3, I can either:
   a. Go via room_1.
   b. Go via room_4.
   Option (b) is ruled out due to constraint (c).
   So I must go via room_1.
4. To go to room_1, I need to unlock yellow_door_1.
5. To go from room_1 to room_3, I need to unlock purple_door_1.
6. Once in room_3, I go in front of grey_door_1 and unlock it.

This verification confirms that the plan I derived is indeed optimal.

So, my optimal plan is:

```
gotoobject red_ball_2 room_2
pick red_ball_2 room_2
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_1
toggle yellow_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_1 yellow_door_1
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_3
toggle purple_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_3 purple_door_1
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4
toggle grey_door_1
```

Let's double check if there are other red balls in the world:

"red_ball_1 is in room_1"
"red_ball_2 is in room_2"
"red_ball_3 is in room_2"
"red_ball_4 is in room_2"

Yes, there are four red balls in total. red_ball_1 is in room_1, and the rest are in room_2. Since I'm already in room_2, I can pick any of the red balls in room_2 for my plan. I've chosen red_ball_2, but I could have picked red_ball_3 or red_ball_4 as well. (This matter for constraint (e), "Before being in front of grey_door_1, I must have been holding some object or specifically red_ball_2.")

Let me check if there is a shorter path if I pick a different ball. Well given constraint (e), I must have been holding "some object" or "red_ball_2" before being in front of grey_door_1. So it's not strictly necessary to pick red_ball_2; I could have chosen any other ball. The length of the plan would be the same.

So, the optimal plan remains:

```
gotoobject red_ball_2 room_2
pick red_ball_2 room_2
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_1
toggle yellow_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_1 yellow_door_1
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_3
toggle purple_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_3 purple_door_1
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4
toggle grey_door_1
```

Actually, let's revisit constraint (e) once more. It states:

"If expression 'you are in front of grey_door_1' holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: 'At least one of the following conditions is true: "you are holding some object", "you are holding red_ball_2"'"

So before being in front of grey_door_1, I must have been in a state where I'm either holding "some object" OR specifically holding red_ball_2.

I realize this is a tautology! "You are holding some object" is a more general case of "you are holding red_ball_2." So it's saying that before being in front of grey_door_1, I must have been holding some object.

Nonetheless, my plan ensures that I'm holding red_ball_2 before being in front of grey_door_1, so this constraint is satisfied.

In conclusion, the optimal plan is:

```
gotoobject red_ball_2 room_2
pick red_ball_2 room_2
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_1
toggle yellow_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_1 yellow_door_1
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_3
toggle purple_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_3 purple_door_1
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4
toggle grey_door_1
```
