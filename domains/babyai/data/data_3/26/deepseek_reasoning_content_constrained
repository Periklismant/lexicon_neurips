Okay, let's try to tackle this planning problem. First, I need to understand the goal and constraints clearly. The goal is to have a grey door (d) that's unlocked, I'm in front of it, and it's not locked. The constraints are a bit complex, so I need to make sure each one is satisfied.

First, the initial state. I'm in room_2. All doors are locked. The objects are spread across rooms. The doors are yellow_door_1 (connects room_1 and 2), purple_door_1 (room_1 and 3), red_door_1 (room_2 and 4), and grey_door_1 (room_3 and 4). But the constraint says I can't be in room_4 at any time. So any action that would take me to room_4 is forbidden. So I can't use red_door_1 or grey_door_1 to go into room_4.

The goal door must be grey. The only grey door is grey_door_1, which connects room_3 and 4. But since I can't go into room_4, I have to be in room_3 to be in front of grey_door_1. Wait, because the door is between room_3 and 4. So to be in front of grey_door_1, I need to be in room_3, right? Because the door is in room_3 and room_4. So the position in front of the door in room_3 would be where I can go. But I need to get to room_3 first.

But how do I get to room_3? The doors connecting to room_3 are purple_door_1 (from room_1) and grey_door_1 (from room_4, which is off-limits). So to get to room_3, I need to go through room_1 via purple_door_1. But room_1 is connected to room_2 via yellow_door_1. So the path would be room_2 -> yellow_door_1 to room_1, then room_1 -> purple_door_1 to room_3. But both yellow_door_1 and purple_door_1 are initially locked. So I need to unlock them.

But to unlock a door, I have to toggle it. To toggle a door, I need to be in front of it. So I need to go to the door in the current room and toggle it. Let's see. Starting in room_2. The doors in room_2 are yellow_door_1 (to room_1) and red_door_1 (to room_4, which we can't use). But red_door_1 is locked. But the constraint says that "red_door_1 is locked" must hold in at least one state. So we need to ensure that red_door_1 is locked at some point. Since it's initially locked, maybe that's already satisfied, but perhaps we have to make sure that it's not unlocked before that condition is met. Wait, but the first constraint is that "red_door_1 is locked" must hold in at least one state. Since it's initially locked, that's already true. So maybe that constraint is already satisfied. But the second constraint is that if red_door_1 is locked in some state, then either I'm holding red_ball_1 or I'm in room_1 at that state or a later one. Since red_door_1 is locked initially, and the initial state has me in room_2, I need to ensure that either I go to room_1 or hold red_ball_1 at some point after the initial state. But red_ball_1 is in room_1. So perhaps when I go to room_1, that would satisfy this constraint.

So to recap, steps needed:

1. Get to room_3 to be in front of grey_door_1, then unlock it.
2. But to get to room_3, I need to go through room_1 via purple_door_1.
3. To get to room_1 from room_2, use yellow_door_1. But it's locked. So I need to unlock it first.
4. So first, go to yellow_door_1 in room_2, toggle it to unlock. Then go to room_1.
5. Then in room_1, go to purple_door_1, toggle it to unlock, then go to room_3.
6. In room_3, go to grey_door_1, toggle it to unlock. Then check if that meets the goal: being in front of grey_door_1 (which is grey), which is now unlocked.

But wait, the goal is that there exists a door d that is grey, I'm in front of it, and it's not locked. So after unlocking grey_door_1 while in room_3, that should satisfy the goal.

But also, the constraints:

- The fourth constraint says that "you are in front of grey_door_1" must hold in at least one state. That's part of the goal, so that's covered.

- The fifth constraint: if I'm in front of grey_door_1 in some state, there must be an earlier state where I was holding some object or red_ball_2. So before getting to grey_door_1, I need to have held something or red_ball_2.

Hmm. How to satisfy that? So when I'm in front of grey_door_1 (say, in room_3), before that step, I need to have held an object. So maybe pick up an object earlier, then drop it before proceeding.

Looking at the objects in the rooms:

In room_2, there's grey_ball_1, red_ball_2, etc. Maybe pick up red_ball_2 in room_2 before moving to room_1. But then I can carry it to room_1, then room_3. Then when I drop it, but I need to drop it somewhere. But that might complicate things. Alternatively, pick it up and hold it until I reach room_3, then drop it there. But would that interfere with other steps? Let's think.

So possible steps:

Start in room_2.

1. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_2 (since I'm in room_2)
Wait, but the action is "gotoobject x r" which requires being in the same room as x. So to go to grey_ball_1 in room_2. Then pick it up. But that would satisfy the fifth constraint: when I later get in front of grey_door_1, I had held an object (grey_ball_1) earlier. But wait, the fifth constraint says that if I'm in front of grey_door_1, there must be an earlier state where I was holding some object or red_ball_2. So holding any object would suffice, or specifically red_ball_2. So picking up any object (like grey_ball_1) before that step would satisfy the constraint.

Alternatively, pick up red_ball_2. Let's see. Let's plan this:

1. In room_2: gotoobject red_ball_2 room_2
2. pick red_ball_2 room_2
3. Now holding red_ball_2. Then proceed to unlock doors.

But then, when moving to room_1, need to drop it? Or carry it. Wait, but to toggle doors, I need to be in front of them, which requires not being blocked. But if the doors are blocked by objects, I can't go to them. Wait, the preconditions for "goto door": (ii) there is no object blocking the position in front of d in the room you're in. So if there's an object in front of the door, you can't go there. But once you pick up an object, it's no longer blocking. Wait, the effect of picking up an object is (v) if x was blocking some door, then it is no longer blocking that door. So if an object was blocking a door, picking it up unblocks it.

But in the initial state, are any objects blocking doors? The initial positions of objects aren't specified as blocking doors. Wait, the problem says "the rooms of the gridworld may include two types of objects: boxes and balls. Each door, box and ball in the gridworld has a color." But the initial state doesn't mention any objects blocking doors. So perhaps the doors aren't blocked initially. So the only issue is when moving to a door's position, if there's an object there, which would block it. But since the initial state doesn't mention objects blocking doors, maybe they are not. So maybe the doors are unblocked.

So assuming that the doors are not blocked by objects, then the steps can proceed.

So back to the plan. Let's outline:

Start in room_2. Need to unlock yellow_door_1 (room_2 to room_1), which is locked. To unlock it:

1. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_1 (since I'm in room_2, and yellow_door_1 connects room_2 and room_1)
2. toggle yellow_door_1 (now it's unlocked)
3. gotoroom room_2 room_1 yellow_door_1 (move to room_1)
Now in room_1. Need to go to purple_door_1 (connects room_1 and room_3), which is locked. So:

4. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_3
5. toggle purple_door_1 (unlock it)
6. gotoroom room_1 room_3 purple_door_1 (move to room_3)
Now in room_3. Need to get to grey_door_1, which connects to room_4. But since room_4 is off-limits, I have to stay in room_3. So:

7. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4 (since grey_door_1 connects room_3 and 4)
8. toggle grey_door_1 (unlock it)
Now, after step 8, I'm in front of grey_door_1 (grey), which is now unlocked. This satisfies the goal: there exists a door d (grey_door_1) that is grey, I'm in front of it, and it's not locked. So the goal is achieved.

But wait, the fifth constraint: if I'm in front of grey_door_1 (step 7 and 8), there must be an earlier state where I was holding some object or red_ball_2. But in the steps above, I haven't picked up any object. So that constraint isn't satisfied. Therefore, I need to adjust the plan to include picking up an object before step 7.

So, perhaps pick up an object in room_2 before moving to room_1, then drop it somewhere else.

Let's adjust:

Start in room_2.

0. gotoobject red_ball_2 room_2
1. pick red_ball_2 room_2 (now holding it)
2. drop red_ball_2 room_2 (but why? Maybe not necessary. Alternatively, carry it to room_1 and drop there. But need to check if holding it would interfere with other actions.)

Wait, the constraint requires that in some state before being in front of grey_door_1, I was holding some object or red_ball_2. So if I pick up red_ball_2 in room_2, then later drop it in room_2, that would satisfy the constraint. Because in the state after step 1, I'm holding red_ball_2, which is before step 7 (when I'm in front of grey_door_1). So even if I drop it later, the fact that I held it earlier satisfies the constraint.

But let's see:

After step 1, I'm holding red_ball_2. Then proceed to unlock doors:

3. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_1
But to do this, I need to be in front of yellow_door_1. But if I'm holding red_ball_2, can I still go to the door? The preconditions for "goto door" don't require the hands to be empty, only that the position in front of the door is not blocked. So yes. So:

3. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_1 (possible)
4. toggle yellow_door_1 (unlocks it)
5. gotoroom room_2 room_1 yellow_door_1 (move to room_1)
Now in room_1, still holding red_ball_2. Then:

6. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_3
7. toggle purple_door_1 (unlock)
8. gotoroom room_1 room_3 purple_door_1 (to room_3)
Still holding red_ball_2. Then:

9. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4
10. toggle grey_door_1 (unlocks it)
Now, in step 9, I'm in front of grey_door_1. The earlier state where I was holding red_ball_2 (steps 1-8) satisfies the fifth constraint.

But then I need to drop the ball somewhere. But the goal doesn't require any specific placement of objects, only the door condition. So after step 10, the goal is achieved. However, the problem says that the plan must bring about the goal while satisfying all constraints, but doesn't mention needing to drop the ball. So maybe it's okay to be holding it at the end. But the drop action requires that the position in front of me is empty. So when I'm in front of grey_door_1, if I want to drop, I need to be in front of an empty position. But after step 9, I'm in front of grey_door_1. So to drop, I need to first go to an empty position, then drop.

But the goal doesn't require dropping, so maybe it's unnecessary. But the constraints don't mention anything about holding objects. So perhaps leaving it as is is okay.

Wait, but the "drop" action's effect is that the object is in the current room. If I'm in room_3 and drop red_ball_2 there, then it's in room_3. But the problem's initial state has red_ball_2 in room_2. But the problem's goal doesn't require objects to be in specific rooms. So that's allowed.

But maybe the plan can proceed without dropping. However, the fifth constraint is satisfied by having held red_ball_2 before being in front of grey_door_1. So the steps would be:

1. gotoobject red_ball_2 room_2
2. pick red_ball_2 room_2
3. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_1
4. toggle yellow_door_1
5. gotoroom room_2 room_1 yellow_door_1
6. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_3
7. toggle purple_door_1
8. gotoroom room_1 room_3 purple_door_1
9. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4
10. toggle grey_door_1

That's 10 steps. But is this the optimal? Let's check if any steps can be shortened.

Alternatively, maybe pick up grey_ball_1 in room_2 instead. But same number of steps.

Wait, step 0: in room_2. Let me list the steps again with numbers:

1. gotoobject red_ball_2 room_2
2. pick red_ball_2 room_2
3. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_1
4. toggle yellow_door_1
5. gotoroom room_2 room_1 yellow_door_1
6. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_3
7. toggle purple_door_1
8. gotoroom room_1 room_3 purple_door_1
9. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4
10. toggle grey_door_1

But after step 10, the goal is achieved. So the plan is 10 steps. But maybe there's a shorter way.

Wait, after picking up red_ball_2 in step 2, can I proceed directly to the door without dropping? Yes. So that's okay.

But let's check constraints:

- The first constraint: "red_door_1 is locked" must hold in at least one state. Since we never touch red_door_1, it remains locked. So the initial state already satisfies this. So that's covered.

- The second constraint: if red_door_1 is locked in some state (which is always true), then in that state or later, I must be in room_1 or holding red_ball_1. Since we go to room_1 in step 5, that satisfies this constraint.

- Third constraint: never be in room_4. Our plan doesn't go to room_4, so that's okay.

- Fourth constraint: be in front of grey_door_1. Step 9 and 10 achieve that.

- Fifth constraint: when in front of grey_door_1 (step 9), there must be an earlier state where I held something. Steps 2-10: holding red_ball_2 from step 2 onwards. So yes, that's satisfied.

So this plan seems to meet all constraints and the goal.

But wait, after step 8, when moving to room_3, we are in room_3. Then step 9: gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4. But room_3 is connected to room_4 via grey_door_1. So gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4 is allowed. Then toggle it. Now, grey_door_1 is unlocked. So the goal is achieved.

But the plan has 10 steps. Let's see if we can optimize.

Wait, after step 2, we are holding red_ball_2. When we go to room_1 (step 5), then to room_3 (step 8), and then to grey_door_1 in room_3 (step 9). Then toggle it (step 10). So that's correct.

Is there a way to avoid carrying the ball all the way? For example, pick up and drop it earlier. But then the constraint would still be satisfied as long as we held it before step 9.

Alternative plan:

1. gotoobject red_ball_2 room_2
2. pick red_ball_2 room_2
3. drop red_ball_2 room_2 (after dropping, we're in front of it, but hands are empty)
4. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_1
5. toggle yellow_door_1
6. gotoroom room_2 room_1 yellow_door_1
7. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_3
8. toggle purple_door_1
9. gotoroom room_1 room_3 purple_door_1
10. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4
11. toggle grey_door_1

This plan has 11 steps, which is longer. So the previous plan is better.

Another idea: perhaps pick up grey_ball_1 in room_2 instead, then drop it after unlocking yellow_door_1. Let's see:

1. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_2
2. pick grey_ball_1 room_2
3. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_1
4. toggle yellow_door_1
5. drop grey_ball_1 room_2 (but after step 3, I'm in front of yellow_door_1. To drop, need to be in front of an empty position. So I need to gotoempty after step 4, then drop.

Wait, this complicates things. Let's think:

1. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_2
2. pick grey_ball_1 room_2
3. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_1
4. toggle yellow_door_1
5. gotoroom room_2 room_1 yellow_door_1 (now in room_1, holding grey_ball_1)
6. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_3
7. toggle purple_door_1
8. gotoroom room_1 room_3 purple_door_1
9. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4
10. toggle grey_door_1

In this case, the fifth constraint is satisfied because we held grey_ball_1 before step 9. But then we are carrying it all the way to room_3, which might not be necessary. But the plan is 10 steps, same as the previous one.

So whichever object is picked, the number of steps remains the same. So the initial plan with red_ball_2 is acceptable.

But wait, when we pick up red_ball_2 in room_2, and then carry it to room_1 and room_3, is there any problem with that? The drop action is not required unless we need to free our hands for something else, but in this plan, we don't need to pick up anything else. So it's okay.

But the problem states that the plan must be optimal, i.e., the shortest possible. So can we find a shorter plan?

Alternative approach: perhaps use the grey_ball_1 in room_2. Let's see:

Start in room_2.

1. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_2
2. pick grey_ball_1 room_2 (now holding it)
3. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_1
4. toggle yellow_door_1
5. gotoroom room_2 room_1 yellow_door_1
6. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_3
7. toggle purple_door_1
8. gotoroom room_1 room_3 purple_door_1
9. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4
10. toggle grey_door_1

Same 10 steps. So whether I pick red_ball_2 or grey_ball_1, the steps are the same.

But perhaps there's a shorter path. Let's see.

Wait, the fifth constraint requires that before being in front of grey_door_1, I held some object or red_ball_2. So if I pick up grey_ball_1 (which is not red_ball_2), then I'm holding "some object", which satisfies the constraint. So either way is okay.

Is there a way to avoid picking up an object? For example, maybe using the fact that being in front of grey_door_1 is required, and the constraint is that before that, I held some object or red_ball_2. If I can find a way to get to room_3 without picking up an object but somehow holding red_ball_2 at some point.

But red_ball_2 is in room_2. So to hold it, I need to be in room_2. But after moving to room_1 and room_3, I can't go back to room_2 to pick it up, unless I can return. Let me check:

Wait, after moving to room_1, can I go back to room_2 via yellow_door_1? Yes, once it's unlocked. But that would add more steps. For example:

Plan with returning:

1. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_1
2. toggle yellow_door_1
3. gotoroom room_2 room_1 yellow_door_1 (room_1)
4. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_1 (but red_ball_1 is in room_1)
5. pick red_ball_1 room_1 (now holding it)
6. gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1 (back to room_2)
7. gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_4 (but we can't go to room_4. But perhaps just to unlock it? No, because we need to avoid being in room_4. Also, the third constraint says I can't be in room_4 at any time. So using red_door_1 is not allowed. So perhaps this approach isn't useful.)

Alternatively, after step 3 (in room_1), pick up red_ball_1. Then proceed to room_3. But red_ball_1 is in room_1. So:

1. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_1
2. toggle yellow_door_1
3. gotoroom room_2 room_1 yellow_door_1
4. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_1
5. pick red_ball_1 room_1
6. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_3
7. toggle purple_door_1
8. gotoroom room_1 room_3 purple_door_1
9. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4
10. toggle grey_door_1

Now, in this plan, I picked up red_ball_1 in room_1. Then, when I'm in front of grey_door_1 (step 9), I had held red_ball_1 (step 5-10). So this satisfies the fifth constraint. Also, the second constraint requires that if red_door_1 is locked (which it is), then I'm in room_1 or holding red_ball_1. When I'm in room_1 (step 3 onwards), that satisfies the second constraint. So this plan also works. And it's 10 steps as well.

But the problem is that red_ball_1 is in room_1. So after moving to room_1 (step 3), I can pick it up. This plan may be better because it uses red_ball_1, which is in room_1, thus satisfying the second constraint (since being in room_1 after the initial state when red_door_1 is locked).

But the second constraint says: if red_door_1 is locked in some state s, then at s or later, I must be in room_1 or holding red_ball_1. In the initial state, red_door_1 is locked, and I'm in room_2. So in the initial state, the constraint is violated? Wait, no. The constraint says that if in some state s, red_door_1 is locked, then in s or some state after s, I must be in room_1 or holding red_ball_1. So in the initial state s0, red_door_1 is locked. So in s0 or any state after, I must be in room_1 or holding red_ball_1. Since in s0, I'm in room_2 and not holding red_ball_1, this violates the constraint. Therefore, the plan must ensure that after the initial state, at some point, I'm in room_1 or holding red_ball_1.

Ah, this is a crucial point. The initial state has red_door_1 locked, and me in room_2. The second constraint requires that if at any state s, red_door_1 is locked, then in s or a subsequent state, I'm in room_1 or holding red_ball_1. So the initial state s0 has red_door_1 locked. Therefore, in s0 or later, I must be in room_1 or holding red_ball_1. But in s0, I'm in room_2 and not holding red_ball_1, so the constraint is violated unless I later enter room_1 or pick up red_ball_1.

Therefore, the plan must include either entering room_1 or picking up red_ball_1 at some point after the initial state.

In the previous plans where I go to room_1 via yellow_door_1, that satisfies the constraint because I enter room_1. So any plan that takes me to room_1 satisfies the second constraint. For example, the first plan where I pick up red_ball_2 in room_2 and then go to room_1 satisfies the second constraint because entering room_1 happens after the initial state.

But if a plan doesn't go to room_1 and doesn't hold red_ball_1, then it's invalid. So the earlier plan where I pick up red_ball_2 in room_2 and then go to room_1 is okay, because entering room_1 satisfies the second constraint.

So the initial plan is valid.

But let's confirm the constraint again:

The second constraint is: If "red_door_1 is locked" holds in some state s, then "you are in room_1" or "holding red_ball_1" must hold at s or some state after s.

In the initial state, red_door_1 is locked, and s is s0. So in s0 or later, I must be in room_1 or holding red_ball_1.

In the initial plan where I pick up red_ball_2 in room_2 and then go to room_1:

At s0: red_door_1 locked, I'm in room_2. So the constraint is not satisfied at s0. But in later states, I go to room_1 (step 5). So in step 5, I'm in room_1, which satisfies the constraint. Therefore, the constraint is satisfied because after s0, I enter room_1.

But another plan that picks up red_ball_1 in room_1 also satisfies the constraint. So both are valid.

But in the plan where I pick up red_ball_2 and go to room_1, the constraint is satisfied by being in room_1.

So all the plans that involve going to room_1 after s0 are okay.

Therefore, the initial plan is valid.

But now, to check optimality. Can we have a shorter plan?

Let's think: the minimal steps required would be:

- Unlock yellow_door_1 (room_2 to room_1): requires goto door, toggle (steps 1-2)
- Move to room_1 (step 3)
- Unlock purple_door_1 (steps 4-5)
- Move to room_3 (step 6)
- Unlock grey_door_1 (steps 7-8)
- Toggle grey_door_1 (step 8)

Wait, but each door unlock requires two steps: goto door and toggle. Then moving through the door is another step.

Wait, the actions:

To unlock a door:

1. gotodoor d r1 r2 (precondition: in r1)
2. toggle d (now unlocked)
3. gotoroom r1 r2 d (move to r2)

So for each door, it takes 3 steps: goto door, toggle, move through.

But in the plan, to go from room_2 to room_1, then room_1 to room_3, then room_3 to grey_door_1.

So for yellow_door_1: 3 steps (goto, toggle, move)
For purple_door_1: 3 steps (goto, toggle, move)
For grey_door_1: 2 steps (goto, toggle)

But then, also need to pick up an object before grey_door_1.

So the minimal steps would be:

- Pick up object in room_2: 2 steps (goto, pick)
- Unlock yellow_door_1: 2 steps (goto, toggle)
- Move to room_1: 1 step
- Unlock purple_door_1: 2 steps (goto, toggle)
- Move to room_3: 1 step
- Unlock grey_door_1: 2 steps (goto, toggle)

Total steps: 2+2+1+2+1+2= 10 steps. Which matches the previous plan.

So the minimal plan is 10 steps. Thus, the plan provided earlier is optimal.
