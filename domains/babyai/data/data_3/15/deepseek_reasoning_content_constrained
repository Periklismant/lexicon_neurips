Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. Hmm, the goal is to have a grey ball in room_4, with me in room_4 and in front of it. The initial state has grey_ball_2 already in room_4. So maybe I just need to get to room_4 and be in front of it. But there are constraints to satisfy too.

First, the constraints. The first constraint is that at some point, I must be holding grey_ball_2 and purple_box_1 is in room_4. Purple_box_1 starts in room_3. So I need to move that box to room_4. But how? Because doors are locked. Also, doors are all locked initially. So I need to unlock them. Let's see the doors: green_door_1 connects room_1 and 2, yellow_door_1 connects 1 and 3, grey_door_1 connects 2 and 4, yellow_door_2 connects 3 and 4. All locked.

To move from room_2 (where I start) to room_4 via grey_door_1, but that's locked. So I need to toggle it. But to toggle a door, I need to be in front of it. So first, I need to goto the grey_door_1 in room_2. But the door's position might be blocked. Wait, the preconditions for gotodoor say that there's no object blocking the position in front of d in the current room. Are there any objects blocking doors in room_2? The initial state has blue_ball_1 and yellow_box_1 in room_2. But I don't know if they are blocking the door. Wait, the problem doesn't specify initial positions of objects relative to doors. So maybe I can assume that the doors aren't blocked unless stated. So perhaps I can go to the door.

But let's check. Let's think step by step.

Starting in room_2. Need to unlock grey_door_1 to get to room_4. But to toggle it, I need to be in front of it. So:

1. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_4 (since grey_door_1 connects room_2 and 4)
2. toggle grey_door_1 (unlocks it)
3. gotoroom room_2 room_4 grey_door_1

But once in room_4, I can then gotoobject grey_ball_2 room_4. Then the goal is achieved. But wait, the goal requires that the grey ball is in room_4 (which it already is), I'm in room_4, and in front of it. So maybe that's possible. But wait, the initial state of grey_ball_2 is in room_4. So maybe just go there. But the doors are locked. So need to unlock grey_door_1 first.

But also, the constraints. The first constraint is that at some state, I must be holding grey_ball_2 and purple_box_1 is in room_4. So even if the grey_ball_2 is already in room_4, I need to pick it up and drop it again? Because purple_box_1 needs to be moved to room_4. So that complicates things. Let me think.

So, to satisfy the first constraint, I have to have a state where I'm holding grey_ball_2 and purple_box_1 is in room_4. Purple_box_1 starts in room_3. So I need to move it from room_3 to room_4. How? The doors from room_3 to room_4 is yellow_door_2, which is locked. So need to unlock that door. But I'm starting in room_2. So the path would be room_2 → room_4 via grey_door_1 (if unlocked) but then from room_4 to room_3 via yellow_door_2. But that's also locked. Alternatively, maybe go through room_1 and room_3. Let's see:

Possible path: room_2 → room_1 via green_door_1 (locked, need to unlock), then room_1 → room_3 via yellow_door_1 (locked, need to unlock). Then in room_3, get the purple_box_1, take it to room_4 via yellow_door_2 (locked, need to unlock). But that's a lot of doors to unlock.

Alternatively, if I can move through room_4 first. Let's see: start in room_2. Unlock grey_door_1, go to room_4. Then from room_4, unlock yellow_door_2 (but need to be in room_4 and go to the door, then toggle it. Then go to room_3, get the purple_box_1, bring it to room_4. But that requires moving between rooms multiple times.

But the first constraint requires that purple_box_1 is in room_4 and I'm holding grey_ball_2 at some point. So, let's outline the steps:

1. From room_2, go to grey_door_1 (door connecting room_2 and 4), toggle to unlock. Then go to room_4. Then go to grey_ball_2, pick it up (so now holding grey_ball_2). Then drop it (but why? Because the goal is to be in front of it. So maybe after picking, I can drop it again, but then need to be in front of it. Alternatively, perhaps after moving the purple box, pick up grey_ball_2 again.)

But how to get purple_box_1 to room_4. So, from room_3, purple_box_1 is there. To get to room_3, I need to go through room_1 or room_4. Let's see:

Starting in room_2. Maybe:

- Unlock green_door_1 (room_2 to room_1), which is locked. To do that, go to green_door_1 in room_2. But green_door_1 connects room_1 and 2. So in room_2, can I go to green_door_1? Yes. So:

Action: gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_1 (precondition: in room_2, which is true. Also, no object blocking. Assuming that's possible.)

Then toggle green_door_1 (unlocks it). Then go to room_1. Then from room_1, go to yellow_door_1 (connecting to room_3). Unlock that door. Then go to room_3. Then pick up purple_box_1, then take it to room_4 via yellow_door_2. But yellow_door_2 is locked. So need to unlock that as well.

This seems complicated. Let's see if there's a shorter path.

Alternatively, from room_2, unlock grey_door_1, go to room_4. Then from room_4, unlock yellow_door_2 (connecting to room_3). Then go to room_3, pick up purple_box_1, bring it to room_4. Then, in room_4, drop it. Then pick up grey_ball_2 (to satisfy the constraint of holding it). Then drop it again to be in front of it.

But let's map this out step by step.

Initial state: in room_2, not holding anything.

Step 1: goto grey_door_1 (room_2 to room_4). So gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_4. Precondition: in room_2 (yes), door connects to room_2 and 4 (yes), and no object blocking. Assuming that's true. Then toggle grey_door_1 (unlocks it). Then gotoroom room_2 room_4 grey_door_1. Now in room_4. So now, can go to grey_ball_2 in room_4. Action: gotoobject grey_ball_2 room_4. Then pick it up. Now holding grey_ball_2. Then drop it (maybe not needed, but the goal requires being in front of it. Wait, the goal is to have the ball in room_4, me in room_4, and in front of it. So if I pick it up, then I'm holding it, so not in front. So perhaps after picking it up, I need to drop it again. But then I need to be in an empty position to drop. Alternatively, maybe I can just go to it again.

Wait, the problem is to have the final state be: a grey ball (v) in room_4, me in room_4, and in front of v. Since grey_ball_2 is already in room_4, maybe all I need is to be in room_4 and in front of it. So perhaps the initial plan of unlocking grey_door_1, going to room_4, then going to the ball would work. But then the constraints have to be met.

But the first constraint requires that in at least one state, I am holding grey_ball_2 and purple_box_1 is in room_4. So even if I pick up grey_ball_2 in room_4, but purple_box_1 is still in room_3, that doesn't satisfy the constraint. So I need to move purple_box_1 to room_4 at some point.

So the steps must include moving purple_box_1 to room_4. To do that:

From room_4, I need to go to room_3 via yellow_door_2. But yellow_door_2 is locked. So first, unlock yellow_door_2. To do that, in room_4, go to yellow_door_2 (gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_3), then toggle to unlock. Then go to room_3. Now in room_3, there's purple_box_1. Pick it up (but need to goto it first). Then carry it back to room_4 via yellow_door_2 (since door is unlocked). Then drop it in room_4. Then, in room_4, pick up grey_ball_2 (to satisfy the constraint of holding it), then drop it again. But also, during this process, the other constraints must be met.

The second constraint requires that in at least one state, either I'm in front of red_ball_1 or yellow_door_1 is unlocked. Since red_ball_1 is in room_1, unless I go there, I can't be in front of it. Alternatively, if yellow_door_1 is unlocked. So maybe unlocking yellow_door_1 would satisfy this constraint. But if I don't go through room_1, how can I unlock yellow_door_1? It's in room_1 and room_3. So to unlock it, I need to be in room_1 or room_3 and in front of it.

Alternatively, perhaps when I go to room_3 via yellow_door_2, I don't need to unlock yellow_door_1. Wait, but the second constraint requires that either I am in front of red_ball_1 (in room_1) or yellow_door_1 is not locked. So if I unlock yellow_door_1, even if I don't use it, that would satisfy the constraint. But how do I unlock yellow_door_1? To do that, I need to be in front of it. It's between room_1 and room_3. So, if I'm in room_1, I can goto yellow_door_1 (room_1 to room_3), toggle it. Then it's unlocked, satisfying the constraint. But that requires going to room_1. Which is connected via green_door_1 from room_2. So maybe that's a detour.

Alternatively, can I satisfy the second constraint by unlocking yellow_door_1? Let's see. If I unlock yellow_door_1, then in that state, the door is unlocked, so the condition holds. So if I can unlock yellow_door_1, then that's one way. To do that, need to be in front of it. So from room_1 or room_3. But to get to room_1, I have to unlock green_door_1 (connects room_2 and 1). Then from room_1, go to yellow_door_1, toggle it. Then yellow_door_1 is unlocked. But that adds steps. Hmm.

Third constraint: in some state, either in front of grey_box_1 (in room_3) or holding something. So if during the process I pick up an object (like purple_box_1 or grey_ball_2), that would satisfy the third constraint. For example, when I pick up purple_box_1, I'm holding it, so the condition is met. So maybe the third constraint is automatically satisfied when moving the purple box.

Putting it all together, here's a possible plan:

1. From room_2, go to grey_door_1 (room_2 to 4), toggle to unlock.
2. Go to room_4.
3. Go to yellow_door_2 (room_4 to 3), toggle to unlock.
4. Go to room_3.
5. Go to purple_box_1 in room_3, pick it up.
6. Go back to room_4 via yellow_door_2.
7. Drop purple_box_1 in room_4 (now satisfies the first constraint's condition when we hold grey_ball_2 later).
8. Go to grey_ball_2 in room_4, pick it up (now holding it, and purple_box_1 is in room_4 → satisfies first constraint).
9. Drop grey_ball_2 (so that we can be in front of it in the end).
10. Gotoempty to be in front of an empty spot (not needed if after dropping, we are already in front of it. Wait, the drop action puts the object in front of you. So after dropping, you are in front of it. So step 9 would leave me in front of grey_ball_2 in room_4. So maybe steps 8 and 9 are enough.

But wait, the goal is to have me in room_4, in front of a grey ball (grey_ball_2) which is in room_4. So after step 9, I'm in room_4, in front of grey_ball_2. But I need to check if all constraints are met.

Let's check the constraints:

- First constraint: At some state, I'm holding grey_ball_2 and purple_box_1 is in room_4. That happens when I pick up grey_ball_2 (step 8), and after dropping purple_box_1 in step 7. So yes, in step 8, I'm holding grey_ball_2 and purple_box_1 is in room_4. So that's satisfied.

- Second constraint: At some state, either in front of red_ball_1 or yellow_door_1 is unlocked. In this plan, I never go to room_1 or interact with yellow_door_1. So yellow_door_1 remains locked. So this constraint isn't satisfied. So this plan is invalid. Therefore, I need to address this.

So the second constraint requires that either I'm in front of red_ball_1 (which is in room_1) or yellow_door_1 is unlocked. Since in the current plan, neither happens, I need to adjust.

How to satisfy this? Either unlock yellow_door_1 or go to room_1 and be in front of red_ball_1.

Unlocking yellow_door_1 would require being in room_1 or room_3 and toggling it. Let's see: yellow_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3. So to unlock it, I can be in room_1 and go to the door, then toggle. But getting to room_1 requires unlocking green_door_1. So:

Alternative plan steps:

After step 7 (dropping purple_box_1 in room_4), maybe go back to room_3, then go to room_1 via yellow_door_1 (but it's locked). So need to unlock it.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let's see:

Alternative approach:

1. Unlock green_door_1 (room_2 to 1).

Steps:

1. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_1
2. toggle green_door_1 (unlocks)
3. gotoroom room_2 room_1 green_door_1 → now in room_1
4. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_1 → now in front of red_ball_1 (satisfies second constraint)
5. Now, proceed with other steps.

But then how to get to room_4 and move purple_box_1. Let's see:

Alternatively, after step 4, go to yellow_door_1 (room_1 to 3), unlock it:

6. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3
7. toggle yellow_door_1 → unlocks it
8. gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1 → now in room_3
9. gotoobject purple_box_1 room_3, pick it up
10. gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_2 (but need to unlock yellow_door_2 first. So first, in room_3, go to yellow_door_2 (room_3 to 4)
11. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_3 room_4
12. toggle yellow_door_2 → unlocks
13. gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_2 → now in room_4
14. drop purple_box_1 → now purple_box_1 in room_4
15. gotoobject grey_ball_2 room_4, pick it up → now holding it (satisfies first constraint)
16. drop grey_ball_2 → in front of it, in room_4 → goal achieved.

But during this plan, in step 4, I was in front of red_ball_1, satisfying the second constraint. Also, the third constraint is satisfied when I pick up purple_box_1 (step 9) or grey_ball_2 (step 15), so at least one of those steps meets the third constraint.

This plan seems to meet all constraints. Let's check the steps:

- Steps 1-4: Unlock green_door_1, go to room_1, goto red_ball_1 → satisfies second constraint (in front of red_ball_1)
- Then unlock yellow_door_1, go to room_3, get purple_box_1, unlock yellow_door_2, go to room_4, drop purple_box_1, then handle grey_ball_2.

But this plan is longer. Let's see:

But the first constraint is to have a state where I'm holding grey_ball_2 and purple_box_1 is in room_4. That would occur in step 15 (holding grey_ball_2) after step 14 (purple_box_1 in room_4). So yes.

Now, the third constraint: at some state, either in front of grey_box_1 or holding something. grey_box_1 is in room_3. So when we are in room_3 and pick up purple_box_1 (step 9), we are holding something, which satisfies the third constraint.

So this plan satisfies all constraints.

Now, is there a shorter path? Because the user wants an optimal plan with minimal steps.

Alternative idea: Maybe unlock yellow_door_1 instead of going to red_ball_1. So if in room_3, unlock yellow_door_1 from room_3's side. Then the second constraint would be satisfied by yellow_door_1 being unlocked.

But to unlock yellow_door_1 from room_3, I need to be in room_3. So in the earlier plan, when we are in room_3 (step 8), after getting there via room_1, we can go to yellow_door_1 (room_3's side), toggle it (unlocking), which would make yellow_door_1 unlocked. That would satisfy the second constraint (since yellow_door_1 is not locked). So in that case, step 7: toggle yellow_door_1 (unlock), then in that state, yellow_door_1 is unlocked. So the second constraint is satisfied.

So in that case, we don't need to go to room_1 and be in front of red_ball_1. So steps could be:

1. Unlock green_door_1 (room_2 to room_1)
2. Go to room_1
3. Unlock yellow_door_1 (room_1 to room_3)
4. Go to room_3
5. Unlock yellow_door_2 (room_3 to room_4)
6. Go to room_4, then go to room_3 again via yellow_door_2 (since it's now unlocked)
Wait, no. Let's try:

Alternative plan:

1. From room_2, go to green_door_1 (room_2 to room_1)
2. Toggle to unlock
3. Go to room_1
4. Go to yellow_door_1 (room_1 to room_3)
5. Toggle to unlock (now yellow_door_1 is unlocked → satisfies second constraint)
6. Go to room_3
7. Go to purple_box_1, pick up
8. Go to yellow_door_2 (room_3 to room_4)
9. Toggle to unlock
10. Go to room_4
11. Drop purple_box_1
12. Go to grey_ball_2, pick up (satisfy first constraint)
13. Drop it, now in front of it.

But in step 5, toggling yellow_door_1 unlocks it, so in that state, yellow_door_1 is not locked. So the second constraint is satisfied. And third constraint is satisfied when holding purple_box_1 (step7) and grey_ball_2 (step12).

This plan is shorter. Let's count steps:

1. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_1
2. toggle green_door_1
3. gotoroom room_2 room_1 green_door_1
4. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3
5. toggle yellow_door_1
6. gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1
7. gotoobject purple_box_1 room_3
8. pick purple_box_1 room_3
9. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_3 room_4
10. toggle yellow_door_2
11. gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_2
12. drop purple_box_1 room_4
13. gotoobject grey_ball_2 room_4
14. pick grey_ball_2 room_4
15. drop grey_ball_2 room_4

Wait, but after step 14, we are holding grey_ball_2 and purple_box_1 is in room_4 (step12). So the first constraint is satisfied. Then step15: drop grey_ball_2, and now in front of it. So goal is achieved.

But the steps here are 15. But maybe some steps can be optimized. For example, after step 11 (in room_4), dropping purple_box_1 (step12) requires going to an empty position? Or can I drop it immediately after entering room_4? Because when you enter a room, you are no longer in front of any object. So after gotoroom to room_4, I'm in room_4 but not in front of anything. So to drop, I need to be in front of an empty spot.

So after step 11, you are in room_4. Then:

12. gotoempty (to be in front of empty spot)
13. drop purple_box_1 room_4 (now in front of empty spot → drop requires that the position in front is empty. So after gotoempty, you are in front of empty, so drop is possible. Then purple_box_1 is in room_4.

Then:

14. gotoobject grey_ball_2 room_4
15. pick grey_ball_2 room_4
16. drop grey_ball_2 room_4

But this adds steps. Alternatively, after entering room_4, can I go directly to an empty spot, drop, then go to grey_ball_2.

Alternatively, after entering room_4 (step11), perhaps you can go to an empty spot (gotoempty), then drop. So step 12: gotoempty. Then step13: drop purple_box_1. Then step14: gotoobject grey_ball_2. Step15: pick. Step16: drop.

This makes the plan longer. But maybe necessary.

Alternatively, when you enter room_4 via yellow_door_2 from room_3, you are not in front of any object. So to drop purple_box_1, you need to be in front of an empty spot. So gotoempty is needed.

Hmm, so the initial plan may require more steps.

But the key is to find the minimal steps. Let's see.

Alternative approach:

Let me try to find the minimal path that satisfies all constraints.

First, the goal is to be in room_4, in front of grey_ball_2. The initial location of grey_ball_2 is room_4, so that's already there.

Constraints:

1. At some state: holding grey_ball_2 and purple_box_1 in room_4.

2. At some state: in front of red_ball_1 or yellow_door_1 unlocked.

3. At some state: in front of grey_box_1 or holding something.

So the minimal steps would involve unlocking the necessary doors, moving purple_box_1 to room_4, and during the process, satisfy the constraints.

Let's see:

Start in room_2.

Option 1: Unlock grey_door_1, go to room_4. Unlock yellow_door_2, go to room_3, get purple_box_1, bring to room_4. Then pick grey_ball_2 (satisfy constraint 1), and during this process, unlock yellow_door_1 to satisfy constraint 2.

But how to unlock yellow_door_1? If we can unlock it from room_3.

Wait, yellow_door_1 connects room_1 and 3. So in room_3, we can goto yellow_door_1 (room_3 to 1), toggle to unlock. Then yellow_door_1 is unlocked, satisfying constraint 2. So:

Plan steps:

1. goto grey_door_1 (room_2 to 4)
2. toggle to unlock
3. goto room_4
4. goto yellow_door_2 (room_4 to 3)
5. toggle to unlock
6. goto room_3
7. goto yellow_door_1 (room_3 to 1)
8. toggle yellow_door_1 → unlocks it (satisfies constraint 2)
9. goto purple_box_1 in room_3, pick up
10. goto yellow_door_2 (room_3 to 4)
11. goto room_4
12. gotoempty, drop purple_box_1
13. goto grey_ball_2, pick up (satisfies constraint 1)
14. drop grey_ball_2 (now in front of it)

This plan has steps 1-14. Let's check constraints:

- Constraint 2: After step 8, yellow_door_1 is unlocked. So in the state after step 8, yellow_door_1 is not locked. So constraint 2 is satisfied.

- Constraint 3: When we pick up purple_box_1 (step9), we are holding something, satisfying constraint 3.

- Constraint 1: When we pick up grey_ball_2 (step13), purple_box_1 is in room_4 (step12). So yes.

This plan seems to satisfy all constraints. Now, let's check the steps:

1. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_4
2. toggle grey_door_1
3. gotoroom room_2 room_4 grey_door_1
4. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_3
5. toggle yellow_door_2
6. gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_2
7. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1
8. toggle yellow_door_1
9. gotoobject purple_box_1 room_3
10. pick purple_box_1 room_3
11. gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_2
12. gotoempty
13. drop purple_box_1 room_4
14. gotoobject grey_ball_2 room_4
15. pick grey_ball_2 room_4
16. drop grey_ball_2 room_4

Wait, after step 6 (goto room_3), step7 is gotodoor yellow_door_1 (room_3 to 1). Then toggle. Then step9: gotoobject purple_box_1 (which is in room_3). Then pick. Then step11: go back to room_4. Then drop. Then goto grey_ball_2, pick and drop.

But the step count here is 16. Let's see if this is correct.

But perhaps there's a way to reduce steps. For example, after step 8 (unlock yellow_door_1), maybe we can proceed to pick purple_box_1 directly. Let's see:

After step 8, we are in front of yellow_door_1 in room_3. Then we need to go to purple_box_1. So:

Step9: gotoobject purple_box_1 room_3

Step10: pick purple_box_1 room_3

Then step11: goto yellow_door_2 (room_3 to 4), which is already unlocked.

Step12: gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_2

Step13: gotoempty

Step14: drop purple_box_1 room_4

Step15: gotoobject grey_ball_2 room_4

Step16: pick grey_ball_2 room_4

Step17: drop grey_ball_2 room_4

This is still 17 steps. Hmm.

Alternatively, can we avoid some steps? For example, after dropping purple_box_1 in room_4, we can go directly to grey_ball_2. But perhaps not, because after dropping, you're in front of the object, so if you want to pick it up again, you need to be in front of it again. Wait, when you drop an object, you are in front of it. So after step14 (drop purple_box_1), you are in front of purple_box_1. Then to pick up grey_ball_2, you need to go to it. So steps:

After step14: in front of purple_box_1. Then step15: gotoobject grey_ball_2 room_4 (but need to be in the same room, which you are). Then pick and drop.

So steps would be:

1. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_4
2. toggle grey_door_1
3. gotoroom room_2 room_4 grey_door_1
4. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_3
5. toggle yellow_door_2
6. gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_2
7. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1
8. toggle yellow_door_1
9. gotoobject purple_box_1 room_3
10. pick purple_box_1 room_3
11. gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_2
12. gotoempty
13. drop purple_box_1 room_4
14. gotoobject grey_ball_2 room_4
15. pick grey_ball_2 room_4
16. drop grey_ball_2 room_4

Still 16 steps. Is there a way to optimize?

Alternatively, after step13 (drop purple_box_1), you're in front of it. To pick grey_ball_2, you need to go to it. But if you are in front of purple_box_1, you can't drop grey_ball_2 there unless you first gotoempty. Wait, but the drop action requires that the position in front is empty. So after step13, when you drop purple_box_1, you are in front of it. Then to pick grey_ball_2, you need to go to it (step14), pick (step15), then drop (step16). So that's three steps.

But is there a way to avoid some of these steps? For example, when you are in room_4 and have to drop purple_box_1, maybe you can drop it in front of a door or something. Not sure.

Alternatively, when you enter room_4 via yellow_door_2 (step11), you are in room_4 but not in front of any object. So you can drop purple_box_1 immediately after entering, but you need to be in front of an empty spot. So step12: gotoempty, step13: drop. Then step14: gotoobject grey_ball_2, pick, drop.

Alternatively, after entering room_4, can you drop purple_box_1 without gotoempty? Because when you enter the room via gotoroom, you are no longer in front of anything. So to drop, you need to be in front of an empty spot. So you have to do gotoempty first.

Hmm. So steps seem necessary.

But maybe there's a shorter path. Let's think differently.

What if we don't need to move purple_box_1 but just pick up grey_ball_2 and then drop it? But the first constraint requires that purple_box_1 is in room_4. So it's mandatory to move it.

Alternatively, is there a way to bring purple_box_1 to room_4 via a different path?

Original position of purple_box_1: room_3. Doors to room_4 are yellow_door_2 (room_3-4). But it's locked initially. So need to unlock it.

The minimal steps to move purple_box_1 to room_4:

1. From room_2, unlock grey_door_1, go to room_4.
2. Unlock yellow_door_2, go to room_3.
3. Pick up purple_box_1.
4. Return to room_4 via yellow_door_2.
5. Drop purple_box_1.

Then pick up grey_ball_2.

But during this process, need to satisfy the constraints.

Constraint 2: Need to either unlock yellow_door_1 or be in front of red_ball_1. If we can unlock yellow_door_1 during this process, but that requires being in room_1 or room_3. If we are in room_3, after step 2, we can unlock yellow_door_1 (which connects to room_1). So:

After step 2 (in room_3), gotodoor yellow_door_1 (room_3 to 1), toggle to unlock. Then constraint 2 is satisfied.

So steps:

1. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_4
2. toggle grey_door_1
3. gotoroom room_2 room_4 grey_door_1
4. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_3
5. toggle yellow_door_2
6. gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_2
7. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1
8. toggle yellow_door_1 → unlocks it (satisfies constraint 2)
9. gotoobject purple_box_1 room_3
10. pick purple_box_1 room_3
11. gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_2
12. gotoempty
13. drop purple_box_1 room_4
14. gotoobject grey_ball_2 room_4
15. pick grey_ball_2 room_4 (satisfies constraint 1)
16. drop grey_ball_2 room_4 (goal achieved)

This plan has 16 steps and satisfies all constraints.

Constraint 3 is satisfied when we pick purple_box_1 (step10) and grey_ball_2 (step15), so during those steps, we are holding something.

Yes, this works. But is there a shorter way?

Another idea: Can I combine some actions?

For example, after step6 (in room_3), instead of going to yellow_door_1, can I just unlock yellow_door_1 while in room_3? Yes.

But step7 is gotodoor yellow_door_1 in room_3, then toggle. So that's two steps. Maybe there's no way around that.

Alternatively, after step6, can I go directly to purple_box_1, pick it up, and then on the way to room_4, unlock yellow_door_1?

No, because to unlock yellow_door_1, you need to be in front of it.

So the steps are necessary.

Therefore, the plan I outlined earlier seems to be the minimal one that satisfies all constraints.

Now, let's write the plan in the required format.

The final plan steps:

```
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_4
toggle grey_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_4 grey_door_1
gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_3
toggle yellow_door_2
gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_2
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1
toggle yellow_door_1
gotoobject purple_box_1 room_3
pick purple_box_1 room_3
gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_2
gotoempty
drop purple_box_1 room_4
gotoobject grey_ball_2 room_4
pick grey_ball_2 room_4
drop grey_ball_2 room_4
```

Let's count the actions: 15 steps. Let me recount:

1. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_4
2. toggle
3. gotoroom
4. gotodoor yellow_door_2
5. toggle
6. gotoroom
7. gotodoor yellow_door_1
8. toggle
9. gotoobject purple_box_1
10. pick
11. gotoroom
12. gotoempty
13. drop
14. gotoobject grey_ball_2
15. pick
16. drop

Wait, that's 16 steps. So the plan has 16 actions.

But perhaps there's a way to optimize.

Wait, when you drop an object, you are in front of it. So after step13 (drop purple_box_1), you're in front of it. To pick grey_ball_2, you need to go to it. But if grey_ball_2 is in a different position, you need to move there. Alternatively, maybe after dropping purple_box_1, you can immediately go to grey_ball_2. So steps 13-16 are:

13. drop purple_box_1 room_4 → now in front of it
14. gotoobject grey_ball_2 room_4 → move to grey_ball_2
15. pick grey_ball_2 room_4 → holding it
16. drop grey_ball_2 room_4 → now in front of it

Yes, so that's correct.

But how many steps are there? Let's list them:

1. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_4
2. toggle grey_door_1
3. gotoroom room_2 room_4 grey_door_1
4. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_3
5. toggle yellow_door_2
6. gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_2
7. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1
8. toggle yellow_door_1
9. gotoobject purple_box_1 room_3
10. pick purple_box_1 room_3
11. gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_2
12. gotoempty
13. drop purple_box_1 room_4
14. gotoobject grey_ball_2 room_4
15. pick grey_ball_2 room_4
16. drop grey_ball_2 room_4

Yes, 16 steps. This seems to be the minimal steps given the constraints. Each step is necessary to unlock doors, move objects, and meet the constraints.

Now, let's verify each action's preconditions:

1. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_4: in room_2, which is connected via grey_door_1. No object blocking (assumed).
2. toggle: in front of grey_door_1.
3. gotoroom: door is unlocked now.
4. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_3: in room_4, door connects to room_3. No blocking.
5. toggle: in front of door.
6. gotoroom to room_3.
7. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1: in room_3, door connects to room_1. No blocking.
8. toggle: unlock door.
9. gotoobject purple_box_1: in room_3.
10. pick: not holding anything, in room_3.
11. gotoroom: door unlocked.
12. gotoempty: allowed.
13. drop: holding purple_box_1, in front of empty.
14. gotoobject grey_ball_2: in room_4.
15. pick: not holding anything.
16. drop: holding grey_ball_2.

All preconditions are met.

Constraints:

- Constraint 1: step15 (holding grey_ball_2) and step13 (purple_box_1 in room_4) → satisfied.
- Constraint 2: step8 (yellow_door_1 unlocked) → satisfied.
- Constraint 3: steps10 and 15 (holding objects) → satisfied.

So this plan is valid and meets all requirements.
