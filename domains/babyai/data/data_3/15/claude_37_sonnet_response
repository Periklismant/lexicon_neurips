Let me analyze this problem systematically:

First, let's understand our goal: We need to be in room_4, in front of a grey ball that is also in room_4.

There are two grey balls: grey_ball_1 (initially in room_3) and grey_ball_2 (initially in room_4). Since grey_ball_2 is already in room_4, it might be easier to use that one to satisfy our goal.

We start in room_2, and all doors are locked. Let me plan out a high-level strategy:

1. We need to navigate between rooms, which means unlocking doors
2. We need to satisfy the constraints along the way
3. We eventually need to reach room_4 and be in front of a grey ball

Let's look at the constraints:
1. At some point, we need to be holding grey_ball_2 while purple_box_1 is in room_4 (purple_box_1 starts in room_3)
2. At some point, we need to either be in front of red_ball_1 OR have yellow_door_1 unlocked
3. At some point, we need to either be in front of grey_box_1 OR be holding some object

Now, let's build a plan:

Starting state: We are in room_2, all doors are locked.

First, let's work on getting to grey_ball_2 in room_4:
- We need to get from room_2 to room_4
- The door connecting them is grey_door_1, which is locked
- We need to go to the door, toggle it, and then go through

```
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_4
toggle grey_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_4 grey_door_1
```

Now we're in room_4 with grey_ball_2. Let's go to it:

```
gotoobject grey_ball_2 room_4
```

But wait, we also need to satisfy the constraints. Let's revisit them:

Constraint 1: "At some point, we need to be holding grey_ball_2 while purple_box_1 is in room_4"
- purple_box_1 starts in room_3, so we need to move it to room_4
- We can pick up grey_ball_2, go to room_3, get purple_box_1, and bring it to room_4

Constraint 2: "At some point, we need to either be in front of red_ball_1 OR have yellow_door_1 unlocked"
- red_ball_1 is in room_1
- yellow_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3
- We could either go to room_1 and stand in front of red_ball_1, or unlock yellow_door_1

Constraint 3: "At some point, we need to either be in front of grey_box_1 OR be holding some object"
- grey_box_1 is in room_3
- We'll be holding objects at various points, so this should be naturally satisfied

Let's revise our plan to satisfy these constraints:

```
1. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_4
2. toggle grey_door_1
3. gotoroom room_2 room_4 grey_door_1
4. gotoobject grey_ball_2 room_4
5. pick grey_ball_2 room_4
```

At this point, we're satisfying constraint 3 (we're holding an object). Now we need to get purple_box_1 from room_3 to room_4 to satisfy constraint 1.

```
6. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_3
7. toggle yellow_door_2
8. gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_2
```

Now we're in room_3 with grey_ball_2. We can go to grey_box_1 to satisfy constraint 3 more directly:

```
9. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_3
```

Now we're satisfying constraint 3 in a different way (we're in front of grey_box_1). Next, let's go to purple_box_1:

```
10. gotoobject purple_box_1 room_3
11. gotoempty
12. drop grey_ball_2 room_3
13. gotoobject purple_box_1 room_3
14. pick purple_box_1 room_3
```

Now we need to go back to room_4 with purple_box_1:

```
15. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_3 room_4
16. gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_2
```

At this point, we're satisfying constraint 1: we're holding purple_box_1 and it's in room_4. But wait, the constraint says "you are holding grey_ball_2" and "purple_box_1 is in room_4". So let's revise:

```
15. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_3 room_4
16. gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_2
17. gotoempty
18. drop purple_box_1 room_4
```

Now purple_box_1 is in room_4, but we're not holding grey_ball_2. Let's go back to get it:

```
19. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_3
20. gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_2
21. gotoobject grey_ball_2 room_3
22. pick grey_ball_2 room_3
23. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_3 room_4
24. gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_2
```

Now we're holding grey_ball_2 and purple_box_1 is in room_4, satisfying constraint 1. We still need to address constraint 2. Let's try to unlock yellow_door_1:

```
25. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_3
26. gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_2
27. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1
28. drop grey_ball_2 room_3
29. toggle yellow_door_1
```

Now yellow_door_1 is unlocked, satisfying constraint 2. Let's pick up grey_ball_2 again and head back to room_4:

```
30. gotoobject grey_ball_2 room_3
31. pick grey_ball_2 room_3
32. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_3 room_4
33. gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_2
34. gotoempty
35. drop grey_ball_2 room_4
36. gotoobject grey_ball_2 room_4
```

Now we're in room_4, in front of grey_ball_2, which satisfies our goal.

Let me double-check our plan to ensure it's valid and optimized:

Actually, I see some errors and inefficiencies in my plan. Let me revise:

Starting state: We are in room_2, all doors are locked.

1. First, let's unlock the door to room_4:
```
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_4
toggle grey_door_1
```

2. Now let's go to room_4:
```
gotoroom room_2 room_4 grey_door_1
```

3. Let's unlock the door to room_3:
```
gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_3
toggle yellow_door_2
```

4. Now we can go to room_3:
```
gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_2
```

5. Let's satisfy constraint 2 by unlocking yellow_door_1:
```
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1
toggle yellow_door_1
```

6. We can also satisfy constraint 3 by going to grey_box_1:
```
gotoobject grey_box_1 room_3
```

7. Now let's pick up grey_ball_1 to prepare for constraint 1:
```
gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_3
pick grey_ball_1 room_3
```

8. Let's also pick up purple_box_1 to move it to room_4 (for constraint 1):
```
gotoempty
drop grey_ball_1 room_3
gotoobject purple_box_1 room_3
pick purple_box_1 room_3
```

9. Let's move purple_box_1 to room_4:
```
gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_3 room_4
gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_2
gotoempty
drop purple_box_1 room_4
```

10. Now purple_box_1 is in room_4, let's get grey_ball_2 for constraint 1:
```
gotoobject grey_ball_2 room_4
pick grey_ball_2 room_4
```

Now we're holding grey_ball_2 and purple_box_1 is in room_4, which satisfies constraint 1.

11. Finally, let's complete our goal by dropping grey_ball_2 and standing in front of it:
```
gotoempty
drop grey_ball_2 room_4
gotoobject grey_ball_2 room_4
```

Now we're in room_4, in front of grey_ball_2, which is also in room_4, satisfying our goal.

Wait - let me catch a potential issue. We need to visit grey_box_1 AND be holding some object for constraint 3. Let me re-verify:

No, the constraint is: "At some point, we need to either be in front of grey_box_1 OR be holding some object"

So we're fine here, as we go in front of grey_box_1 in step 6.

Let me re-review our plan once more:

Actually, I see an issue. While we do pick up grey_ball_1 at some point, we might not need to. The constraint requires us to be holding grey_ball_2 (not grey_ball_1) while purple_box_1 is in room_4.

Let me revise the plan again:

Starting state: We are in room_2, all doors are locked.

1. First, let's unlock the door to room_4:
```
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_4
toggle grey_door_1
```

2. Now let's go to room_4:
```
gotoroom room_2 room_4 grey_door_1
```

3. Let's pick up grey_ball_2 for constraint 1:
```
gotoobject grey_ball_2 room_4
pick grey_ball_2 room_4
```

4. Let's unlock the door to room_3:
```
gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_3
toggle yellow_door_2
```

5. Now we can go to room_3 (still holding grey_ball_2):
```
gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_2
```

6. Let's satisfy constraint 2 by unlocking yellow_door_1:
```
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1
toggle yellow_door_1
```

7. We can also satisfy constraint 3 by going to grey_box_1 (while we're holding grey_ball_2):
```
gotoobject grey_box_1 room_3
```

8. Now let's get purple_box_1 to move it to room_4 (for constraint 1):
```
gotoempty
drop grey_ball_2 room_3
gotoobject purple_box_1 room_3
pick purple_box_1 room_3
```

9. Let's move purple_box_1 to room_4:
```
gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_3 room_4
gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_2
gotoempty
drop purple_box_1 room_4
```

10. Now purple_box_1 is in room_4, let's get grey_ball_2 for constraint 1:
```
gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_3
gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_2
gotoobject grey_ball_2 room_3
pick grey_ball_2 room_3
```

11. Let's go back to room_4 with grey_ball_2:
```
gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_3 room_4
gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_2
```

Now we're holding grey_ball_2 and purple_box_1 is in room_4, which satisfies constraint 1.

12. Finally, let's complete our goal by dropping grey_ball_2 and standing in front of it:
```
gotoempty
drop grey_ball_2 room_4
gotoobject grey_ball_2 room_4
```

Actually, I realize I've been misinterpreting the problem statement. Let me reconsider:

The goal says: "There is a ball v such that "The following conditions are all true: "v is grey", "v is in room_4", "you are in room_4", "you are in front of v""

This means we need to be in room_4, in front of a grey ball that is also in room_4. It doesn't specify which grey ball, so we could use either grey_ball_1 or grey_ball_2.

grey_ball_2 is already in room_4, so using that might be simpler. But we also need to satisfy the constraints.

Let's build a complete plan from scratch:

Starting state: We are in room_2, all doors are locked.

Step 1: Let's unlock the door to room_4:
```
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_4
toggle grey_door_1
```

Step 2: Now let's go to room_4:
```
gotoroom room_2 room_4 grey_door_1
```

Step 3: Let's unlock the door to room_3:
```
gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_3
toggle yellow_door_2
```

Step 4: Now we can go to room_3:
```
gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_2
```

Step 5: Let's satisfy constraint 2 by unlocking yellow_door_1:
```
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1
toggle yellow_door_1
```

Step 6: Let's satisfy constraint 3 by going to grey_box_1:
```
gotoobject grey_box_1 room_3
```

Step 7: Now let's pick up purple_box_1 to move it to room_4 (for constraint 1):
```
gotoobject purple_box_1 room_3
pick purple_box_1 room_3
```

Step 8: Let's move purple_box_1 to room_4:
```
gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_3 room_4
gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_2
gotoempty
drop purple_box_1 room_4
```

Step 9: Now purple_box_1 is in room_4, let's get grey_ball_2 for constraint 1:
```
gotoobject grey_ball_2 room_4
pick grey_ball_2 room_4
```

Now we're holding grey_ball_2 and purple_box_1 is in room_4, which satisfies constraint 1.

Step 10: Finally, let's complete our goal by dropping grey_ball_2 and standing in front of it:
```
gotoempty
drop grey_ball_2 room_4
gotoobject grey_ball_2 room_4
```

Now we're in room_4, in front of grey_ball_2, which is also in room_4, satisfying our goal.

Let me again verify this plan meets all our requirements and constraints:

Goal: We are in room_4, in front of grey_ball_2, which is a grey ball in room_4. ✓

Constraint 1: At some point, we need to be holding grey_ball_2 while purple_box_1 is in room_4. This is satisfied after Step 9. ✓

Constraint 2: At some point, we need to either be in front of red_ball_1 OR have yellow_door_1 unlocked. We unlock yellow_door_1 in Step 5. ✓

Constraint 3: At some point, we need to either be in front of grey_box_1 OR be holding some object. We go in front of grey_box_1 in Step 6. ✓

I think this plan is valid and optimal. Let me double-check for any errors or inefficiencies:

1. Unlock the door from room_2 to room_4 (grey_door_1)
2. Go to room_4
3. Unlock the door from room_4 to room_3 (yellow_door_2)
4. Go to room_3
5. Unlock the door from room_3 to room_1 (yellow_door_1) - satisfies constraint 2
6. Go to grey_box_1 in room_3 - satisfies constraint 3
7. Go to purple_box_1 in room_3
8. Pick up purple_box_1
9. Go back to room_4 with purple_box_1
10. Drop purple_box_1 in room_4
11. Go to grey_ball_2 in room_4
12. Pick up grey_ball_2 - along with step 10, satisfies constraint 1
13. Drop grey_ball_2
14. Go to grey_ball_2 - satisfies the goal

This seems optimal to me! Let's translate it into the correct action format:

```
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_4
toggle grey_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_4 grey_door_1
gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_3
toggle yellow_door_2
gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_2
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1
toggle yellow_door_1
gotoobject grey_box_1 room_3
gotoobject purple_box_1 room_3
pick purple_box_1 room_3
gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_3 room_4
gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_2
gotoempty
drop purple_box_1 room_4
gotoobject grey_ball_2 room_4
pick grey_ball_2 room_4
gotoempty
drop grey_ball_2 room_4
gotoobject grey_ball_2 room_4
```

Let me review this plan once more to ensure correctness:

Step 1: `gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_4` - We go to grey_door_1 in room_2 ✓
Step 2: `toggle grey_door_1` - We unlock grey_door_1 ✓
Step 3: `gotoroom room_2 room_4 grey_door_1` - We go to room_4 from room_2 using grey_door_1 ✓
Step 4: `gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_3` - We go to yellow_door_2 in room_4 ✓
Step 5: `toggle yellow_door_2` - We unlock yellow_door_2 ✓
Step 6: `gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_2` - We go to room_3 from room_4 using yellow_door_2 ✓
Step 7: `gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1` - We go to yellow_door_1 in room_3 ✓
Step 8: `toggle yellow_door_1` - We unlock yellow_door_1 (satisfies constraint 2) ✓
Step 9: `gotoobject grey_box_1 room_3` - We go to grey_box_1 in room_3 (satisfies constraint 3) ✓
Step 10: `gotoobject purple_box_1 room_3` - We go to purple_box_1 in room_3 ✓
Step 11: `pick purple_box_1 room_3` - We pick up purple_box_1 in room_3 ✓
Step 12: `gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_3 room_4` - We go to yellow_door_2 in room_3 ✓
Step 13: `gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_2` - We go to room_4 from room_3 using yellow_door_2 ✓
Step 14: `gotoempty` - We go to an empty position in room_4 ✓
Step 15: `drop purple_box_1 room_4` - We drop purple_box_1 in room_4 ✓
Step 16: `gotoobject grey_ball_2 room_4` - We go to grey_ball_2 in room_4 ✓
Step 17: `pick grey_ball_2 room_4` - We pick up grey_ball_2 in room_4 (satisfies constraint 1 with step 15) ✓
Step 18: `gotoempty` - We go to an empty position in room_4 ✓
Step 19: `drop grey_ball_2 room_4` - We drop grey_ball_2 in room_4 ✓
Step 20: `gotoobject grey_ball_2 room_4` - We go to grey_ball_2 in room_4 (satisfies the goal) ✓

This plan is valid, satisfies all constraints, and achieves the goal. I believe it's also optimal in terms of the number of steps.
