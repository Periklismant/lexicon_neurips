Let me break down this planning problem, understand the initial state, the goal, and the constraints, and then determine a valid sequence of actions to solve it.

### Initial State
- I am in room_4
- green_box_1 is in room_1
- yellow_box_1 is in room_1
- grey_ball_1 is in room_2
- blue_ball_1 is in room_2
- blue_ball_2 is in room_3
- grey_ball_2 is in room_3
- grey_box_1 is in room_3
- green_box_2 is in room_4
- All doors are locked
- I'm not holding any object
- I have visited room_4

### Room Layout
- room_1 (north-west) and room_2 (south-west) are connected via purple_door_1
- room_1 (north-west) and room_3 (north-east) are connected via yellow_door_1
- room_2 (south-west) and room_4 (south-east) are connected via red_door_1
- room_3 (north-east) and room_4 (south-east) are connected via purple_door_2

### Goal
- There is a door d such that "The following conditions are all true: "d is yellow", "you are in front of d", "d is not locked""

The yellow door is yellow_door_1, which connects room_1 and room_3. So I need to be in front of yellow_door_1, and it needs to be unlocked.

### Constraints
1. I must be in room_4 at some point (which I already am at the start).
2. If I am in room_4, then at that moment or later I must be in front of purple_door_1. This means I need to get to room_2 or room_1, then go in front of purple_door_1.
3. I must be in front of purple_door_2 at some point.
4. Before being in front of purple_door_2, either I must be holding grey_ball_2, or grey_box_1 must be in room_4.
5. At some point, either blue_ball_2 must be in room_4, or yellow_box_1 must be in room_3.

### Planning
From the initial state and constraints, let me plan:

1. I start in room_4. To get to the yellow door (goal), I need to unlock doors to move between rooms.
2. Since all doors are locked, I need to unlock at least one door to move. I'm in room_4, and according to constraint 3, I need to be in front of purple_door_2 at some point.
3. But according to constraint 4, before I go in front of purple_door_2, I need to either be holding grey_ball_2 or move grey_box_1 to room_4.
4. Grey_ball_2 and grey_box_1 are both in room_3, but I can't get to room_3 initially because all doors are locked.
5. To satisfy constraint 5, I need to either move blue_ball_2 to room_4 or yellow_box_1 to room_3. Blue_ball_2 is in room_3, and yellow_box_1 is in room_1, but again, I can't get to these rooms with the current door situation.

This problem has a challenge: all doors are locked, but I need to move between rooms, and I can only unlock a door if I'm in front of it. It's a bit of a circular problem.

Let's rethink how I can proceed:

1. I'm in room_4.
2. I need to unlock doors to move between rooms.
3. I can only unlock doors that I'm in front of.
4. To get in front of a door, I need to be in one of the rooms that the door connects.
5. From room_4, I can try to go in front of red_door_1 or purple_door_2.
6. According to constraint 4, I need to satisfy a condition before being in front of purple_door_2.

Actually, it seems that I might be able to approach this problem by starting with unlocking doors. I'll map out a detailed sequence of actions:

1. In room_4, I go in front of red_door_1.
2. I toggle red_door_1 to unlock it.
3. I go through red_door_1 to room_2.
4. In room_2, I go in front of purple_door_1.
5. I toggle purple_door_1 to unlock it.
6. I go through purple_door_1 to room_1.
7. In room_1, I go in front of yellow_door_1.
8. I toggle yellow_door_1 to unlock it.
9. I can now reach all rooms.

To satisfy constraint 5, I need to either:
- Move blue_ball_2 from room_3 to room_4, or
- Move yellow_box_1 from room_1 to room_3

Wait, I'm thinking through this and I realized that constraint 4 says that before being in front of purple_door_2, I need to hold grey_ball_2 or have grey_box_1 in room_4. So I need to:

1. Unlock the necessary doors to get to room_3.
2. Pick up grey_ball_2 or move grey_box_1 to room_4.
3. Then go in front of purple_door_2.

Also, constraint 2 states that if I'm in room_4, at that moment or later I must be in front of purple_door_1. Purple_door_1 connects room_1 and room_2, so I need to get to one of those rooms. I also need to get to purple_door_1 at some point, which connects room_1 and room_2.

Let me trace a plan:

1. From room_4, go in front of red_door_1, which connects room_4 and room_2.
2. Toggle red_door_1 to unlock it.
3. Go through red_door_1 to room_2.
4. In room_2, go in front of purple_door_1, which connects room_2 and room_1. This would satisty constraint 2.
5. Toggle purple_door_1 to unlock it.
6. Go through purple_door_1 to room_1.
7. In room_1, go in front of yellow_door_1, which connects room_1 and room_3.
8. Toggle yellow_door_1 to unlock it.
9. Go through yellow_door_1 to room_3.
10. In room_3, find grey_ball_2.
11. Pick up grey_ball_2. (Now we're holding grey_ball_2, which satisfies part of constraint 4).
12. Go in front of purple_door_2, which connects room_3 and room_4. This would satisfy constraint 3.
13. Toggle purple_door_2 to unlock it.
14. Now, to satisfy constraint 5, we need blue_ball_2 to be in room_4 or yellow_box_1 in room_3.
15. Since I'm already in room_3 and holding grey_ball_2, I could drop it, then pick up blue_ball_2, go through purple_door_2 to room_4, and drop blue_ball_2. But then I would need to come back for grey_ball_2 to be holding it when I stand in front of purple_door_2.
16. It might be better to pick up yellow_box_1 from room_1 and place it in room_3 at some point in the plan.

So, let's modify our plan slightly:

1. From room_4, go in front of red_door_1.
2. Toggle red_door_1 to unlock it.
3. Go through red_door_1 to room_2.
4. In room_2, go in front of purple_door_1. This would satisty constraint 2.
5. Toggle purple_door_1 to unlock it.
6. Go through purple_door_1 to room_1.
7. In room_1, find yellow_box_1.
8. Pick up yellow_box_1.
9. Go in front of yellow_door_1.
10. Toggle yellow_door_1 to unlock it.
11. Go through yellow_door_1 to room_3.
12. Drop yellow_box_1. Now we've placed yellow_box_1 in room_3, satisfying constraint 5.
13. Find grey_ball_2.
14. Pick up grey_ball_2.
15. Go in front of purple_door_2. This satisfies constraint 3. And since we're holding grey_ball_2, it also satisfies constraint 4.
16. Toggle purple_door_2 to unlock it.
17. Go back to room_1 (through yellow_door_1).
18. Go in front of yellow_door_1, which is now unlocked. This satisfies the main goal.

Now let me check if this plan satisfies all constraints:

1. "You are in room_4" at some point: Satisfied in the initial state.
2. "If you are in room_4, you must be in front of purple_door_1 at that moment or later": We start in room_4 and later go in front of purple_door_1, so this is satisfied.
3. "You must be in front of purple_door_2 at some point": Satisfied in step 15.
4. "Before being in front of purple_door_2, you must be holding grey_ball_2 or grey_box_1 must be in room_4": We're holding grey_ball_2 in step 15, so this is satisfied.
5. "At some point, blue_ball_2 must be in room_4 or yellow_box_1 must be in room_3": We move yellow_box_1 to room_3 in step 12, so this is satisfied.
6. The goal, "There is a door d such that d is yellow, you are in front of d, and d is not unlocked", is satisfied in step 18.

Actually, let me double-check the goal. It states: "There is a door d such that 'The following conditions are all true: d is yellow, you are in front of d, d is not locked'".

So I need to be in front of a yellow door that is not locked. That's yellow_door_1, and I need to ensure it's unlocked, and I'm standing in front of it.

It seems like my plan above achieves this, since I unlock yellow_door_1 in step 10, and in step 18, I'm in front of yellow_door_1. Let me provide the formal action sequence:

1. "gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2" (Go in front of red_door_1 from room_4)
2. "toggle red_door_1" (Unlock red_door_1)
3. "gotoroom room_4 room_2 red_door_1" (Go from room_4 to room_2 through red_door_1)
4. "gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1" (Go in front of purple_door_1 from room_2)
5. "toggle purple_door_1" (Unlock purple_door_1)
6. "gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1" (Go from room_2 to room_1 through purple_door_1)
7. "gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_1" (Go in front of yellow_box_1 in room_1)
8. "pick yellow_box_1 room_1" (Pick up yellow_box_1)
9. "gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3" (Go in front of yellow_door_1 from room_1)
10. "toggle yellow_door_1" (Unlock yellow_door_1)
11. "gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1" (Go from room_1 to room_3 through yellow_door_1)
12. "gotoempty" (Go to an empty spot)
13. "drop yellow_box_1 room_3" (Drop yellow_box_1 in room_3)
14. "gotoobject grey_ball_2 room_3" (Go in front of grey_ball_2 in room_3)
15. "pick grey_ball_2 room_3" (Pick up grey_ball_2)
16. "gotodoor purple_door_2 room_3 room_4" (Go in front of purple_door_2 from room_3)
17. "toggle purple_door_2" (Unlock purple_door_2)
18. "gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_1" (Go from room_3 to room_1 through yellow_door_1)
19. "gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3" (Go in front of yellow_door_1 from room_1)

Actually, there's an issue with step 18. I need to go back to room_1, but the yellow_door_1 is what connects room_1 and room_3, so I need to go through that door to reach room_1. Let me fix this:

18. "gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_1" (Go from room_3 to room_1 through yellow_door_1)
19. "gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3" (Go in front of yellow_door_1 from room_1)

Now I'm standing in front of yellow_door_1, which is unlocked, and that's the goal.

Hmm, actually I don't need to go back to room_1 at all, let me think this over again to be sure I'm on the right track.

The goal is to be in front of an unlocked yellow door. The only yellow door is yellow_door_1, which connects room_1 and room_3.

So, I can achieve the goal in two ways:
1. Be in room_1 and in front of yellow_door_1 (door to room_3)
2. Be in room_3 and in front of yellow_door_1 (door to room_1)

And I've made sure the door is unlocked.

So, in step 16, I'm in room_3, in front of purple_door_2. I need to go in front of yellow_door_1. I'm already in room_3, so I just need to move in front of yellow_door_1 from the room_3 side.

16. "gotodoor purple_door_2 room_3 room_4" (Go in front of purple_door_2 from room_3)
17. "toggle purple_door_2" (Unlock purple_door_2)
18. "gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1" (Go in front of yellow_door_1 from room_3)

And there, I'm in front of an unlocked yellow door, which is the goal.

OK, let's revise the full plan:

1. "gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2" (Go in front of red_door_1 from room_4)
2. "toggle red_door_1" (Unlock red_door_1)
3. "gotoroom room_4 room_2 red_door_1" (Go from room_4 to room_2 through red_door_1)
4. "gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1" (Go in front of purple_door_1 from room_2)
5. "toggle purple_door_1" (Unlock purple_door_1)
6. "gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1" (Go from room_2 to room_1 through purple_door_1)
7. "gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_1" (Go in front of yellow_box_1 in room_1)
8. "pick yellow_box_1 room_1" (Pick up yellow_box_1)
9. "gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3" (Go in front of yellow_door_1 from room_1)
10. "toggle yellow_door_1" (Unlock yellow_door_1)
11. "gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1" (Go from room_1 to room_3 through yellow_door_1)
12. "gotoempty" (Go to an empty spot)
13. "drop yellow_box_1 room_3" (Drop yellow_box_1 in room_3)
14. "gotoobject grey_ball_2 room_3" (Go in front of grey_ball_2 in room_3)
15. "pick grey_ball_2 room_3" (Pick up grey_ball_2)
16. "gotodoor purple_door_2 room_3 room_4" (Go in front of purple_door_2 from room_3)
17. "toggle purple_door_2" (Unlock purple_door_2)
18. "gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1" (Go in front of yellow_door_1 from room_3)

Now let's check that this plan satisfies all the constraints:

1. "You are in room_4" at some point: Satisfied in the initial state. We're in room_4 at the start.
2. "If you are in room_4, you must be in front of purple_door_1 at that moment or later": We start in room_4 and later go in front of purple_door_1 in step 4, so this is satisfied.
3. "You must be in front of purple_door_2 at some point": Satisfied in step 16.
4. "Before being in front of purple_door_2, you must be holding grey_ball_2 or grey_box_1 must be in room_4": We're holding grey_ball_2 in step 15, before step 16, so this is satisfied.
5. "At some point, blue_ball_2 must be in room_4 or yellow_box_1 must be in room_3": We move yellow_box_1 to room_3 in step 13, so this is satisfied.
6. The goal, "There is a door d such that d is yellow, you are in front of d, d is not locked", is satisfied in step 18.

All constraints are satisfied. However, I'm noticing we can possibly simplify the plan. We don't need to go back to room_1 after unlocking purple_door_2. We can just go to yellow_door_1 from room_3. I'll revise the plan:

1. "gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2" (Go in front of red_door_1 from room_4)
2. "toggle red_door_1" (Unlock red_door_1)
3. "gotoroom room_4 room_2 red_door_1" (Go from room_4 to room_2 through red_door_1)
4. "gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1" (Go in front of purple_door_1 from room_2)
5. "toggle purple_door_1" (Unlock purple_door_1)
6. "gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1" (Go from room_2 to room_1 through purple_door_1)
7. "gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_1" (Go in front of yellow_box_1 in room_1)
8. "pick yellow_box_1 room_1" (Pick up yellow_box_1)
9. "gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3" (Go in front of yellow_door_1 from room_1)
10. "toggle yellow_door_1" (Unlock yellow_door_1)
11. "gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1" (Go from room_1 to room_3 through yellow_door_1)
12. "gotoempty" (Go to an empty spot)
13. "drop yellow_box_1 room_3" (Drop yellow_box_1 in room_3)
14. "gotoobject grey_ball_2 room_3" (Go in front of grey_ball_2 in room_3)
15. "pick grey_ball_2 room_3" (Pick up grey_ball_2)
16. "gotodoor purple_door_2 room_3 room_4" (Go in front of purple_door_2 from room_3)
17. "toggle purple_door_2" (Unlock purple_door_2)
18. "gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1" (Go in front of yellow_door_1 from room_3)

Upon further consideration, this plan is more than we need. Let me strip it down to the essentials. If I understand correctly, I need to end up standing in front of yellow_door_1, and yellow_door_1 needs to be unlocked. And I need to satisfy the other constraints along the way:

1. "gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2" (Go in front of red_door_1 from room_4)
2. "toggle red_door_1" (Unlock red_door_1)
3. "gotoroom room_4 room_2 red_door_1" (Go from room_4 to room_2 through red_door_1)
4. "gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1" (Go in front of purple_door_1 from room_2)
5. "toggle purple_door_1" (Unlock purple_door_1)
6. "gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1" (Go from room_2 to room_1 through purple_door_1)
7. "gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3" (Go in front of yellow_door_1 from room_1)
8. "toggle yellow_door_1" (Unlock yellow_door_1)
9. "gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1" (Go from room_1 to room_3 through yellow_door_1)
10. "gotoobject grey_ball_2 room_3" (Go in front of grey_ball_2 in room_3)
11. "pick grey_ball_2 room_3" (Pick up grey_ball_2)
12. "gotodoor purple_door_2 room_3 room_4" (Go in front of purple_door_2 from room_3)
13. "toggle purple_door_2" (Unlock purple_door_2)
14. "gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1" (Go in front of yellow_door_1 from room_3)

And for constraint 5, I haven't moved blue_ball_2 to room_4 or yellow_box_1 to room_3. Let me account for one of these. It's easier to move yellow_box_1 to room_3:

9. "gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1" (Go from room_1 to room_3 through yellow_door_1)
10. "gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_1" (Go in front of yellow_box_1 in room_1)
11. "pick yellow_box_1 room_1" (Pick up yellow_box_1)
12. "gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1" (Go from room_1 to room_3 through yellow_door_1)
13. "gotoempty" (Go to an empty spot)
14. "drop yellow_box_1 room_3" (Drop yellow_box_1 in room_3)

But there's an issue: I've gone from room_1 to room_3 in step 9, but then I try to go to yellow_box_1 in room_1 in step 10. That won't work because I'm in a different room.

Let me rethink this to ensure we meet all constraints:

1. "gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2" (Go in front of red_door_1 from room_4)
2. "toggle red_door_1" (Unlock red_door_1)
3. "gotoroom room_4 room_2 red_door_1" (Go from room_4 to room_2 through red_door_1)
4. "gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1" (Go in front of purple_door_1 from room_2)
5. "toggle purple_door_1" (Unlock purple_door_1)
6. "gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1" (Go from room_2 to room_1 through purple_door_1)
7. "gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_1" (Go in front of yellow_box_1 in room_1)
8. "pick yellow_box_1 room_1" (Pick up yellow_box_1)
9. "gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3" (Go in front of yellow_door_1 from room_1)
10. "toggle yellow_door_1" (Unlock yellow_door_1)
11. "gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1" (Go from room_1 to room_3 through yellow_door_1)
12. "gotoempty" (Go to an empty spot)
13. "drop yellow_box_1 room_3" (Drop yellow_box_1 in room_3) (Satisfies constraint 5)
14. "gotoobject grey_ball_2 room_3" (Go in front of grey_ball_2 in room_3)
15. "pick grey_ball_2 room_3" (Pick up grey_ball_2)
16. "gotodoor purple_door_2 room_3 room_4" (Go in front of purple_door_2 from room_3) (Satisfies constraint 3)
17. "toggle purple_door_2" (Unlock purple_door_2)
18. "gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1" (Go in front of yellow_door_1 from room_3) (Satisfies the goal)

Let me check if this plan satisfies all constraints, properly this time:

1. "You are in room_4" at some point: Satisfied in the initial state. We're in room_4 at the start.
2. "If you are in room_4, you must be in front of purple_door_1 at that moment or later": We start in room_4 and later go in front of purple_door_1 in step 4, so this is satisfied.
3. "You must be in front of purple_door_2 at some point": Satisfied in step 16.
4. "Before being in front of purple_door_2, you must be holding grey_ball_2 or grey_box_1 must be in room_4": We're holding grey_ball_2 in step 15, before step 16, so this is satisfied.
5. "At some point, blue_ball_2 must be in room_4 or yellow_box_1 must be in room_3": We move yellow_box_1 to room_3 in step 13, so this is satisfied.
6. The goal, "There is a door d such that d is yellow, you are in front of d, d is not locked", is satisfied in step 18.

All constraints are now properly satisfied. Does this plan require all the steps we've laid out? Let's see if we can optimize further:

1. For constraint 5, we're placing yellow_box_1 in room_3. This satisfies the requirement.
2. For constraint 4, before being in front of purple_door_2, we need to be holding grey_ball_2 or have grey_box_1 in room_4. Since grey_ball_2 is already in room_3, it's easier for us to pick it up, so that's the route we've taken.

I believe the plan is efficient and optimal. However, there's one improvement. After dropping yellow_box_1 in room_3, instead of going to an empty spot then gotoobject grey_ball_2, we can go directly from one to the other, saving an action. Let me revise step 12:

12. "gotoobject grey_ball_2 room_3" (Go in front of grey_ball_2 in room_3) (Replacing gotoempty)

Actually, it's not clear if we have to drop the object to ensure that "yellow_box_1 is in room_3" is satisfied. If "you are carrying yellow_box_1" and you are in room_3, does that imply "yellow_box_1 is in room_3"? From the problem description, it sounds like the object is not considered "in the room" if it's being carried: "object x is situated in the room you are currently in." Let's stick with dropping the box.

But wait a minute. The effects of the "drop" action state: "After performing this action regarding an object x, (i) you are no longer carrying x, (ii) you are in front of x, (iii) your hands are empty, and (iv) object x is situated in the room you are currently in."

So when we drop yellow_box_1, we're in front of it, not at an empty spot. So we need to:

1. Drop yellow_box_1.
2. Go to an empty spot or directly to grey_ball_2 (which is not where yellow_box_1 is).

Let's stick with the revised plan, just making sure the sequence of actions makes sense:

1. "gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2" (Go in front of red_door_1 from room_4)
2. "toggle red_door_1" (Unlock red_door_1)
3. "gotoroom room_4 room_2 red_door_1" (Go from room_4 to room_2 through red_door_1)
4. "gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1" (Go in front of purple_door_1 from room_2)
5. "toggle purple_door_1" (Unlock purple_door_1)
6. "gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1" (Go from room_2 to room_1 through purple_door_1)
7. "gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_1" (Go in front of yellow_box_1 in room_1)
8. "pick yellow_box_1 room_1" (Pick up yellow_box_1)
9. "gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3" (Go in front of yellow_door_1 from room_1)
10. "toggle yellow_door_1" (Unlock yellow_door_1)
11. "gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1" (Go from room_1 to room_3 through yellow_door_1)
12. "gotoempty" (Go to an empty spot)
13. "drop yellow_box_1 room_3" (Drop yellow_box_1 in room_3) (Satisfies constraint 5)
14. "gotoobject grey_ball_2 room_3" (Go in front of grey_ball_2 in room_3)
15. "pick grey_ball_2 room_3" (Pick up grey_ball_2)
16. "gotodoor purple_door_2 room_3 room_4" (Go in front of purple_door_2 from room_3) (Satisfies constraint 3)
17. "toggle purple_door_2" (Unlock purple_door_2)
18. "gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1" (Go in front of yellow_door_1 from room_3) (Satisfies the goal)

Ok, I think this plan is optimal. Now, let me recheck the actual action representation as expected in the output:

Actually, I realized I messed something up. Let me revisit the action "drop":

"drop x r": Drop object x in room r.
The effect of dropping an object x: "(i) you are no longer carrying x, (ii) you are in front of x, (iii) your hands are empty, and (iv) object x is situated in the room you are currently in."

This means we are depositing the object in front of us. So if we want to drop yellow_box_1 in room_3, we need to already be in room_3 in front of an empty position and then drop it.

Our revised sequence:

1. Start in room_4
2. Go in front of red_door_1 from room_4: `gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2`
3. Unlock red_door_1: `toggle red_door_1`
4. Go from room_4 to room_2 through red_door_1: `gotoroom room_4 room_2 red_door_1`
5. Go in front of purple_door_1 from room_2: `gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1`
6. Unlock purple_door_1: `toggle purple_door_1`
7. Go from room_2 to room_1 through purple_door_1: `gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1`
8. Go in front of yellow_box_1 in room_1: `gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_1`
9. Pick up yellow_box_1: `pick yellow_box_1 room_1`
10. Go in front of yellow_door_1 from room_1: `gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3`
11. Unlock yellow_door_1: `toggle yellow_door_1`
12. Go from room_1 to room_3 through yellow_door_1: `gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1`
13. Go to an empty spot: `gotoempty`
14. Drop yellow_box_1 in room_3: `drop yellow_box_1 room_3`
15. Go in front of grey_ball_2 in room_3: `gotoobject grey_ball_2 room_3`
16. Pick up grey_ball_2: `pick grey_ball_2 room_3`
17. Go in front of purple_door_2 from room_3: `gotodoor purple_door_2 room_3 room_4`
18. Unlock purple_door_2: `toggle purple_door_2`
19. Go in front of yellow_door_1 from room_3: `gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1`

This should satisfy all the constraints and achieve the goal.

Wait, I'm still a bit unsure about the drop action. The action description says we can only drop an object if:
  - "(i) you are currently holding x, and (ii) the position in front of you is empty."

So I can't drop the object if I'm already in front of something. I need to be in front of an empty position. So gotoempty should be before, not after, the drop action. Let me revise the sequence again:

1. Start in room_4
2. Go in front of red_door_1 from room_4: `gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2`
3. Unlock red_door_1: `toggle red_door_1`
4. Go from room_4 to room_2 through red_door_1: `gotoroom room_4 room_2 red_door_1`
5. Go in front of purple_door_1 from room_2: `gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1`
6. Unlock purple_door_1: `toggle purple_door_1`
7. Go from room_2 to room_1 through purple_door_1: `gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1`
8. Go in front of yellow_box_1 in room_1: `gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_1`
9. Pick up yellow_box_1: `pick yellow_box_1 room_1`
10. Go in front of yellow_door_1 from room_1: `gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3`
11. Unlock yellow_door_1: `toggle yellow_door_1`
12. Go from room_1 to room_3 through yellow_door_1: `gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1`
13. Go to an empty spot in room_3: `gotoempty`
14. Drop yellow_box_1 in room_3: `drop yellow_box_1 room_3`
15. Go in front of grey_ball_2 in room_3: `gotoobject grey_ball_2 room_3`
16. Pick up grey_ball_2: `pick grey_ball_2 room_3`
17. Go in front of purple_door_2 from room_3: `gotodoor purple_door_2 room_3 room_4`
18. Unlock purple_door_2: `toggle purple_door_2`
19. Go in front of yellow_door_1 from room_3: `gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1`

This plan achieves the goal and satisfies all the constraints. Let's make sure the action representations are correct:

- "gotodoor d r1 r2": Go in front of door d, connecting room r1 to room r2.
- "gotoroom r1 r2 d": Go to room r2 from room r1 using door d.
- "gotoobject x r": Go in front of to object x in room r.
- "gotoempty": Go in front of an empty position of the room, which does not contain any object.
- "pick x r": Pick up object x in room r.
- "drop x r": Drop object x in room r.
- "toggle d": Unlock door d if is locked. Lock door d if is unlocked.

These all seem to match our plan perfectly. Let's submit this plan to solve the problem.

Actually, let's check the optimality one last time. I think the plan is optimal, but I need to make sure. 

The goal is to be in front of an unlocked yellow door.

- The only yellow door is yellow_door_1, which connects room_1 and room_3.
- Initially, I'm in room_4 and all doors are locked.
- I must unblock all doors to reach yellow_door_1.
- I also need to satisfy several constraints along the way.
  
The constraints that need actions to satisfy them are:
1. Being in front of purple_door_1 at some point after being in room_4.
2. Being in front of purple_door_2 at some point.
3. Before being in front of purple_door_2, I must be holding grey_ball_2 or grey_box_1 must be in room_4.
4. At some point, blue_ball_2 must be in room_4 or yellow_box_1 must be in room_3.

For convenience, I'm choosing to:
1. Be in front of purple_door_1 after leaving room_4.
2. Hold grey_ball_2 before being in front of purple_door_2.
3. Have yellow_box_1 in room_3.

Given these choices, the plan is indeed optimal. There's no shorter path I can take.

Actually, I just realized we didn't need to account for constraint 2: "If you are in room_4, then at that moment or later you must be in front of purple_door_1."

We've visited purple_door_1 from room_2, not room_4. We need to ensure that if we are in room_4 at any point, we eventually stand in front of purple_door_1.  We satisfy this constraint in steps 1-5 where I start in room_4 and later find myself in front of purple_door_1.

So the plan is optimal, and I double checked that it accounts for all necessary constraints.

Let's make sure my format is correct. I will provide a valid sequence of actions that solve the planning problem.

Alright! I'm ready to finalize the plan:

```
gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2
toggle red_door_1
gotoroom room_4 room_2 red_door_1
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1
toggle purple_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1
gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_1
pick yellow_box_1 room_1
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3
toggle yellow_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1
gotoempty
drop yellow_box_1 room_3
gotoobject grey_ball_2 room_3
pick grey_ball_2 room_3
gotodoor purple_door_2 room_3 room_4
toggle purple_door_2
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1
```
