Okay, let's see. The goal is to have a yellow door that's unlocked, and I need to be in front of it. The initial state has all doors locked. So I need to unlock a yellow door. Wait, looking at the doors: yellow_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3. So maybe I need to toggle that door. But first, I have to get there. Let me check the initial state: I'm in room_4.

The constraints are a bit tricky. Let me list them out:

1. Must be in room_4 at least once. That's already true initially, but maybe later actions require it again. The initial state says "you have visited room_4", but the constraint is about the state. So probably, the initial state counts, so that's covered. But maybe the plan needs to return to room_4 again? Wait, the first constraint says "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'you are in room_4'". Since the initial state is room_4, that's already satisfied. So no need to go back unless other constraints require it.

Second constraint: If in any state I'm in room_4, then either in that state or a future state, I must be in front of purple_door_1. Purple_door_1 connects room_1 and room_2. Since I start in room_4, and if I have to go to room_1 or room_2, but how? Wait, purple_door_1 is in room_1 and room_2. So if I'm in room_4, and then later go to room_2, then perhaps I can get in front of purple_door_1. But the constraint says whenever I'm in room_4 (like the initial state), then in that state or a later one, I must be in front of purple_door_1. So the initial state is room_4, so I need to be in front of purple_door_1 either in the initial state (which I'm not) or in some state after. So the plan must include being in front of purple_door_1 after the initial state. So I have to go to room_1 or room_2 and then go to that door.

Third constraint: Must be in front of purple_door_2 in at least one state. Purple_door_2 connects room_3 and room_4. Since I start in room_4, I can go to purple_door_2 from room_4. But the door is locked. So maybe I need to unlock it? But the goal requires a yellow door to be unlocked. So perhaps purple_door_2 is purple, not yellow, so maybe not related to the goal. So maybe I just need to go in front of purple_door_2 once, but how? Let me check: purple_door_2 is between room_3 and room_4. If I'm in room_4, can I go to purple_door_2? The action 'gotodoor d r1 r2' requires that I'm in a room connected by d. So from room_4, purple_door_2 connects to room_3. So yes, I can 'gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_3' while in room_4. But the door is locked. However, the 'gotodoor' action doesn't require the door to be unlocked, only that I'm in a room connected by the door and that there's no object blocking the position in front of the door. Are there any objects blocking doors? Let me check the initial state. The objects in rooms: room_4 has green_box_2. Are any boxes or balls blocking doors? The problem statement says that "there is no object blocking the position in front of d in the room you are currently in". So for me to 'gotodoor d r1 r2', there must be no object blocking that position. So I need to check if in room_4, the position in front of purple_door_2 is blocked. The initial state of room_4 has green_box_2. Where is that box located? If it's in front of the door, then I can't go to the door. But the problem doesn't specify object positions beyond their room. So I assume that unless stated otherwise, objects are not blocking door positions. So maybe I can go to purple_door_2 from room_4. So maybe first action is 'gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_3', then toggle it to unlock? Wait, but the goal is to have a yellow door unlocked. So maybe that's not the door we need. Let's get back to the goal.

The goal is a door d that is yellow, in front of it, and unlocked. The yellow door is yellow_door_1, which connects room_1 and room_3. So I need to get to yellow_door_1, unlock it, and be in front of it. But how to get there from room_4.

Path from room_4 to room_1: room_4 is connected to room_2 via red_door_1 and to room_3 via purple_door_2. But all doors are locked initially. So first, I need to unlock some doors. Let's see:

Doors:

- purple_door_1 (purple) connects room_1 and room_2 (locked)
- yellow_door_1 (yellow) connects room_1 and room_3 (locked)
- red_door_1 (red) connects room_2 and room_4 (locked)
- purple_door_2 (purple) connects room_3 and room_4 (locked)

So all doors are locked. To move between rooms, I need to unlock doors. But to unlock a door, I need to be in front of it. But to get in front of a door, I need to be in a room connected by that door, and no object is blocking the position. For example, to unlock red_door_1 (connecting room_2 and room_4), I need to be in room_4 or room_2. Let's see. Starting in room_4, red_door_1 is connected to room_4 and room_2. So from room_4, I can go to red_door_1. But is there an object blocking it? In room_4, there's green_box_2. If it's not blocking the door, then I can 'gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2', then toggle it. But red_door_1 is red, not yellow, so not the goal. However, unlocking it might help in moving to room_2.

Alternatively, maybe I can go from room_4 to room_3 via purple_door_2. If I can unlock purple_door_2, then I can go to room_3. But to unlock purple_door_2, I need to be in front of it. From room_4, I can 'gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_3', then toggle it. Let's try that.

So initial steps:

1. gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_3 (from room_4, which is allowed if no object is blocking)
2. toggle purple_door_2 (since I'm in front of it)
   Now purple_door_2 is unlocked.
3. Then, gotoroom room_4 room_3 purple_door_2 (move to room_3)
   Now in room_3. Room_3 has blue_ball_2, grey_ball_2, grey_box_1.

But the goal is to unlock a yellow door. The yellow door is yellow_door_1 in room_1 and room_3. So to get to yellow_door_1 from room_3, since room_3 and room_1 are connected via yellow_door_1. But that door is locked. So in room_3, I can go to yellow_door_1, but need to unlock it. But to unlock it, I need to toggle it. But to toggle, I need to be in front of it. So from room_3, can I go to yellow_door_1? Yes. So steps from room_3:

4. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1
5. toggle yellow_door_1 (unlocking it)
   Now the door is unlocked. Then, if I'm in front of it, the goal requires me to be in front of it and it's unlocked. So that's the goal. So the final state would be being in front of yellow_door_1, which is yellow and now unlocked. But wait, the problem's goal is "there exists a door d such that d is yellow, you are in front of d, and d is not locked". So after step 5, I'm in front of yellow_door_1, which is unlocked, so that's the goal. But wait, the problem also has constraints.

Constraints:

- The second constraint: if in any state I'm in room_4, then in that state or later, I must be in front of purple_door_1. Since the initial state is in room_4, I need to ensure that after that, I'm in front of purple_door_1. So the plan must include being in front of purple_door_1 at some point after the initial state. But in the steps I outlined, after leaving room_4, I go to room_3, then to yellow_door_1, but never go back to room_1 or room_2. So how to get to purple_door_1?

Purple_door_1 connects room_1 and room_2. So to be in front of it, I need to be in either room_1 or room_2. But to get to room_1 or room_2 from room_3, I need to go through yellow_door_1 (now unlocked) to room_1, then perhaps go to purple_door_1. But that would require moving from room_3 to room_1 via yellow_door_1, then to room_2 via purple_door_1 (which is locked). Wait, purple_door_1 is locked initially, but perhaps after toggling it. Let's see:

After step 5, I'm in room_3, in front of yellow_door_1. Then:

6. gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_1 (move to room_1)
   Now in room_1. Room_1 has green_box_1 and yellow_box_1.

7. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2 (since purple_door_1 connects room_1 and room_2)
8. toggle purple_door_1 (unlocking it)
   Now purple_door_1 is unlocked.

But do I need to be in front of purple_door_1? The second constraint says that if I'm ever in room_4 (which I was initially), then I need to be in front of purple_door_1 in that state or after. So after step 0 (initial state in room_4), the plan must include a step where I'm in front of purple_door_1. But in the current steps, after moving to room_1, then to room_2, but the initial room is room_4. So after leaving room_4, I need to make sure that at some point, I'm in front of purple_door_1.

Wait, in the steps I outlined earlier, after step 6, I'm in room_1. Then step 7: gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2. That would put me in front of purple_door_1. Then toggle it. So after step 7, I'm in front of purple_door_1. So that satisfies the constraint: since the initial state was room_4, and later I'm in front of purple_door_1.

But does this sequence work? Let's retrace:

1. Start in room_4.

2. goto purple_door_2 (room4 to room3 door), toggle to unlock.

3. go to room3.

4. goto yellow_door_1 (room3 to room1), toggle to unlock.

5. go to room1.

6. goto purple_door_1 (room1 to room2), toggle to unlock.

But why do we need to unlock purple_door_1? Because maybe to get to room2, but if the goal is achieved in step5, perhaps we don't need to go further. Wait, the goal is to have a yellow door (yellow_door_1) that's unlocked and be in front of it. So after step5 (toggle yellow_door_1), I'm in front of yellow_door_1 which is now unlocked. So the goal is achieved at that point. But the plan must continue until all constraints are met.

Wait, the problem says the plan must bring about the goal and satisfy all constraints. So even if the goal is achieved early, the constraints must be checked for all states in the plan. So the constraints require:

- At least one state where you are in front of purple_door_2. So in the steps above, step1 is gotodoor purple_door_2, which puts me in front of it. So that's covered.

- The fourth constraint: if in front of purple_door_2, then in an earlier state, either holding grey_ball_2 or grey_box_1 is in room4. Let's see: when I go to purple_door_2 (step1), I need to have either held grey_ball_2 before that or have grey_box_1 in room4. But initially, grey_box_1 is in room3. So how to get grey_box_1 to room4? Maybe pick it up and drop it in room4. Or pick up grey_ball_2 and carry it. Let's check.

In the initial steps:

After step3, I'm in room3. So in room3, there's grey_ball_2 and grey_box_1.

If I pick up grey_ball_2:

4. gotoobject grey_ball_2 room3

5. pick grey_ball_2 room3

Then, I can carry it. Then when I go to purple_door_2 (step1?), but wait, the order is different. Wait, I need to go to purple_door_2 before moving to room3. Wait, initial steps:

Wait, the initial plan I thought was:

1. gotodoor purple_door_2 room4 room3 (so in room4, go to door)

2. toggle purple_door_2 (unlock)

3. gotoroom room4 room3 purple_door_2 (enter room3)

But step1 is in room4, which is allowed. So after step3, I'm in room3. Then, in room3, if I pick up grey_ball_2, then when I go to purple_door_2 (which was step1?), no. Wait, the 'in front of purple_door_2' happens in step1. But according to the fourth constraint, if you are in front of purple_door_2 (step1), then there must be an earlier state where you were holding grey_ball_2 or grey_box_1 is in room4. But in the initial state, grey_box_1 is in room3. So step1 is before any manipulation of grey_ball_2 or grey_box_1. Therefore, the fourth constraint would not be satisfied unless between step1 and when you are in front of purple_door_2, you have done something. Wait, but step1 is the first action. So before step1, the only state is the initial state. So in the initial state, grey_box_1 is in room3, so the condition is not met. Therefore, the constraint is violated because step1 is in front of purple_door_2, but there's no prior state where you held grey_ball_2 or grey_box_1 is in room4. Therefore, the plan must include either moving grey_box_1 to room4 before going to purple_door_2, or picking up grey_ball_2 before going to purple_door_2.

But how can you move grey_box_1 to room4 before going to purple_door_2? Because you start in room4. To move grey_box_1 to room4, you need to be in room3, pick it up, then go back to room4. But to get to room3, you need to use purple_door_2, which is locked. So first, you have to unlock purple_door_2. But to unlock it, you have to be in front of it. So the sequence would be:

1. gotodoor purple_door_2 room4 room3 (in room4)
   - Now in front of purple_door_2. But according to constraint4, this state requires that earlier you have either held grey_ball_2 or grey_box_1 is in room4. But in the initial state, neither is true. So this action would violate the constraint.

Therefore, the initial approach is invalid. So how to satisfy constraint4? The fourth constraint says that if you are in front of purple_door_2 (which is step1 in the previous plan), then there must be a previous state where you held grey_ball_2 or grey_box_1 is in room4. So before step1, you need to have either of these conditions. But since step1 is the first action, you can't have done anything before. Therefore, the only way is to have grey_box_1 in room4 before going to purple_door_2. But how? You are in room4, and grey_box_1 is in room3. You can't pick it up unless you go to room3. But to go to room3, you need to unlock purple_door_2. So you need to:

- Unlock purple_door_2, which requires being in front of it (room4)
- But to unlock it, you need to be in front of it. But when you go in front of it (step1), you trigger constraint4. So perhaps you need to first move grey_box_1 to room4, but you can't get to room3 yet. So this seems impossible. Therefore, the only way is to pick up grey_ball_2 before going to purple_door_2. But how?

Wait, maybe you can't. Because to pick up grey_ball_2, you need to be in room3, which requires going through purple_door_2. But you need to unlock it first. So the only way is:

1. gotodoor purple_door_2 room4 room3 (step1: in front of purple_door_2)
   But this triggers constraint4: need earlier state with grey_ball_2 held or grey_box_1 in room4. But there's no earlier state. So this plan is invalid.

Therefore, the solution must involve getting grey_ball_2 or grey_box_1 into room4 after the initial state but before going to purple_door_2. But how?

Alternatively, maybe after going to purple_door_2 and unlocking it, you can go to room3, pick up grey_ball_2, return to room4, then go to purple_door_2 again. Then, being in front of purple_door_2 the second time would satisfy the constraint because you had carried grey_ball_2 earlier. But the constraint requires that for every occurrence of being in front of purple_door_2, there must be an earlier state where you held grey_ball_2 or grey_box_1 is in room4. So if you have two instances of being in front of purple_door_2, each must have their own earlier state. So perhaps the plan must include:

- First, go to purple_door_2, but you can't, because constraint4 would fail. So maybe the plan must first get grey_box_1 to room4 or pick up grey_ball_2, then go to purple_door_2.

But how to do that:

Alternative approach:

Since you can't reach room3 without unlocking purple_door_2, and you can't unlock purple_door_2 without first being in front of it (triggering constraint4), the only way is to first carry grey_ball_2 or have grey_box_1 in room4 before being in front of purple_door_2.

But that's impossible unless you can move grey_box_1 to room4 without going to room3. So perhaps grey_box_1 is in room3, so you can't get it unless you unlock purple_door_2. So the only way is to first unlock purple_door_2, go to room3, get grey_ball_2 or grey_box_1, bring it back to room4, and then go to purple_door_2 again. But then the first time you go to purple_door_2 (to unlock it), you violate constraint4, because there was no prior state. So perhaps this is impossible. Wait, maybe the fourth constraint says that if you are in front of purple_door_2 in some state, then there must be an earlier state where either you held grey_ball_2 or grey_box_1 is in room4. So for the first time you are in front of purple_door_2 (step1), you need to have had that condition before step1. But since step1 is the first action, you can't. Therefore, the plan must not include being in front of purple_door_2 until after you have moved grey_box_1 to room4 or picked up grey_ball_2.

But how? Let's think differently. Maybe use another door. For example, unlock red_door_1 (connects room4 and room2). If you can unlock red_door_1, then go to room2, then to room1 via purple_door_1 (if unlocked), etc.

But red_door_1 is locked. To unlock it, you need to be in front of it from room4. So:

1. gotodoor red_door_1 room4 room2 (possible if no blocking object)
2. toggle red_door_1 (unlock)
3. gotoroom room4 room2 red_door_1 (enter room2)
Now in room2. Then, from room2, can I go to room1 via purple_door_1 (which is locked). To unlock purple_door_1, need to be in front of it from room1 or room2. But you are in room2 now. So:

4. gotodoor purple_door_1 room2 room1
5. toggle purple_door_1 (unlock)
6. gotoroom room2 room1 purple_door_1 (enter room1)
Now in room1. Then, from room1, unlock yellow_door_1:

7. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room1 room3
8. toggle yellow_door_1 (unlock)
9. gotoroom room1 room3 yellow_door_1 (enter room3)
Now in room3. Then, pick up grey_ball_2:

10. gotoobject grey_ball_2 room3
11. pick grey_ball_2 room3
12. Now holding grey_ball_2. Then return to room4 via purple_door_2, which is still locked. So:

But to get back to room4 from room3, need to unlock purple_door_2. So:

13. gotodoor purple_door_2 room3 room4
14. toggle purple_door_2 (unlock)
15. gotoroom room3 room4 purple_door_2 (enter room4)
Now in room4, holding grey_ball_2. Then, drop it:

16. drop grey_ball_2 room4 (but you need to be in front of an empty position. So maybe:

16. gotoempty (in room4)
17. drop grey_ball_2 room4
Now grey_ball_2 is in room4. Then, go to purple_door_2 again:

18. gotodoor purple_door_2 room4 room3

But step18 would be in front of purple_door_2. Now, the constraint4 says that when you are in front of purple_door_2 (step18), there must be an earlier state where you held grey_ball_2 or grey_box_1 is in room4. Earlier, you held grey_ball_2 in steps11-17, and also dropped it in room4. So that satisfies the constraint. Also, step1 (gotodoor red_door_1) is in front of red_door_1, not purple_door_2, so no constraint triggered there. The first time you are in front of purple_door_2 is step13 and step18. Step13: in room3, so when you gotodoor purple_door_2 room3 room4, you are in front of purple_door_2. So for step13, you need to check constraint4. At step13, have you previously held grey_ball_2 or grey_box_1 in room4?

Before step13, you have steps1-12. In step11, you picked up grey_ball_2. So step13 (being in front of purple_door_2) has a prior state (step11) where you held grey_ball_2. So constraint4 is satisfied for step13. Then step18 is in front of purple_door_2 again, but by then, grey_ball_2 is in room4 (step17), so that also satisfies the constraint.

Additionally, the third constraint is to be in front of purple_door_2 at least once. Steps13 and 18 both satisfy that.

Now, the goal is to be in front of a yellow, unlocked door. The yellow door is yellow_door_1. After step8, we toggled yellow_door_1 (unlocked it). So if we are in front of yellow_door_1 after unlocking it, that meets the goal. Let's see when that happens. Step7: gotodoor yellow_door_1 room1 room3 (in room1), then step8: toggle. Now, after step8, you are in front of yellow_door_1, which is unlocked. So that satisfies the goal. But according to the steps above, after step8, we proceed to enter room3 (step9). So the goal is achieved at step8. Then, the rest of the steps are for fulfilling constraints.

But we need to include the goal in the plan. So the plan should end once the goal is achieved. However, the constraints must be satisfied throughout all states. So if the plan ends at step8, then the other constraints (like being in front of purple_door_2) wouldn't be met. Therefore, the plan must continue until all constraints are met.

Alternatively, maybe the goal can be achieved later, but the plan must also ensure all constraints.

Let's retrace:

Goal is to have a door d (yellow) that is unlocked, and you are in front of it. So steps8 is in front of yellow_door_1, which is now unlocked. So that's the goal. But the other constraints must be met in the plan up to that point.

Wait, the constraints are:

1. At least once in room_4: initial state is room_4, so that's covered.

2. Whenever in room_4 (which is initial state and later steps), then in that state or later, you are in front of purple_door_1. So after the initial state, the plan must include being in front of purple_door_1. But in the current steps, after step3, you are in room2, then step4: gotodoor purple_door_1 room2 room1. So step4 is in front of purple_door_1. So after the initial state (room_4), the plan includes being in front of purple_door_1 (step4), which satisfies the second constraint.

Third constraint: at least once in front of purple_door_2. Which would be step13 and step18.

Fourth constraint: for every occurrence of being in front of purple_door_2, an earlier state has you holding grey_ball_2 or grey_box_1 in room4. For step13: you had held grey_ball_2 in step11, which is before step13. For step18: you had grey_ball_2 in room4 from step17, which is before step18. So that's satisfied.

Fifth constraint: at least once, blue_ball_2 is in room4 or yellow_box_1 is in room3. The initial state has blue_ball_2 in room3 and yellow_box_1 in room1. So to satisfy this, either move blue_ball_2 to room4 or yellow_box_1 to room3.

In the steps above, after step17, grey_ball_2 is in room4. But blue_ball_2 remains in room3. yellow_box_1 is in room1. So to satisfy the fifth constraint, we need to either move blue_ball_2 to room4 or yellow_box_1 to room3.

But according to the current steps, we haven't done that. So this constraint isn't met yet. So we need to add steps to achieve this.

Hmm. So in the steps above, after step17, we have grey_ball_2 in room4, but blue_ball_2 is still in room3. yellow_box_1 is in room1. So the fifth constraint is not met. So we need to either move blue_ball_2 to room4 or yellow_box_1 to room3.

Let's think. To move blue_ball_2 to room4:

In room3, after step9, you are in room3. Then steps10-17: pick grey_ball_2 and drop in room4. So blue_ball_2 is still in room3. To move it to room4, you need to pick it up. But after step17, you are in room4. So you need to go back to room3:

After step17, you are in room4. To get blue_ball_2, you need to:

18. gotoroom room4 room3 purple_door_2 (since it's now unlocked)
19. gotoobject blue_ball_2 room3
20. pick blue_ball_2 room3
21. gotoroom room3 room4 purple_door_2
22. gotoempty
23. drop blue_ball_2 room4

Now blue_ball_2 is in room4, satisfying the fifth constraint. Alternatively, you could move yellow_box_1 from room1 to room3. Let's see:

To move yellow_box_1 from room1 to room3, you need to:

From room1 (after step6), pick up yellow_box_1, then go to room3 via yellow_door_1 (unlocked), and drop it there. But in the steps above, after step6, you are in room1. So steps6: in room1. Steps7-8: unlock purple_door_1, then step9: go to room3. Wait, no: step6 was gotoroom room2 room1 purple_door_1. Wait, in the alternative plan steps:

1. gotodoor red_door_1 room4 room2
2. toggle red_door_1
3. gotoroom room4 room2 red_door_1
4. gotodoor purple_door_1 room2 room1
5. toggle purple_door_1
6. gotoroom room2 room1 purple_door_1
7. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room1 room3
8. toggle yellow_door_1
9. gotoroom room1 room3 yellow_door_1
10. gotoobject grey_ball_2 room3
11. pick grey_ball_2 room3
12. gotodoor purple_door_2 room3 room4
13. toggle purple_door_2
14. gotoroom room3 room4 purple_door_2
15. gotoempty
16. drop grey_ball_2 room4
17. (now need to go back to room3 to get blue_ball_2)
18. gotoroom room4 room3 purple_door_2
19. gotoobject blue_ball_2 room3
20. pick blue_ball_2 room3
21. gotoroom room3 room4 purple_door_2
22. gotoempty
23. drop blue_ball_2 room4

Now, step23 drops blue_ball_2 in room4, satisfying the fifth constraint. But this makes the plan longer, but necessary. Alternatively, after step6 (in room1), you could pick up yellow_box_1 and take it to room3. Let's see:

After step6, in room1:

6. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room1
7. pick yellow_box_1 room1
8. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room1 room3
9. toggle yellow_door_1 (but already toggled in step8 of previous plan)
10. gotoroom room1 room3 yellow_door_1
11. drop yellow_box_1 room3

But this requires adjusting the earlier steps. This approach would move yellow_box_1 to room3, satisfying the fifth constraint. Let's see:

Alternative plan:

Steps 1-6:

1. gotodoor red_door_1 room4 room2
2. toggle red_door_1
3. gotoroom room4 room2 red_door_1
4. gotodoor purple_door_1 room2 room1
5. toggle purple_door_1
6. gotoroom room2 room1 purple_door_1 (now in room1)
7. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room1
8. pick yellow_box_1 room1
9. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room1 room3
10. toggle yellow_door_1 (unlock)
11. gotoroom room1 room3 yellow_door_1
12. drop yellow_box_1 room3 (need to gotoempty first)
13. gotoempty
14. drop yellow_box_1 room3

Now, yellow_box_1 is in room3, satisfying the fifth constraint. Then proceed to handle other constraints. This way, the fifth constraint is met by step14.

But then, the goal is to be in front of a yellow unlocked door. In step10, after toggling yellow_door_1, you are in front of it (step9: gotodoor yellow_door_1, step10: toggle). So the goal is achieved at step10. But the plan must continue to fulfill other constraints.

But this is getting very complex. Let me try to outline the full plan that meets all constraints and the goal.

Final Plan Outline:

1. Unlock red_door_1 to get to room2.
2. Unlock purple_door_1 to get to room1.
3. Unlock yellow_door_1 to get to room3.
4. Pick up grey_ball_2 in room3.
5. Unlock purple_door_2 to return to room4, drop grey_ball_2 there.
6. Go back to room3, pick up blue_ball_2, drop it in room4 (to satisfy fifth constraint).
7. Go to yellow_door_1 again to meet the goal.

Wait, but the goal is already met when you unlock yellow_door_1. But the constraints require being in front of purple_door_2 and other conditions.

Alternatively, let's structure the plan step by step, ensuring all constraints:

Initial State: room_4, all doors locked.

Constraints:

1. At least once in room_4: already met.

2. If in room_4 (initially), then later in front of purple_door_1.

3. At least once in front of purple_door_2.

4. Whenever in front of purple_door_2, earlier state with grey_ball_2 held or grey_box_1 in room4.

5. At least once blue_ball_2 in room4 or yellow_box_1 in room3.

Goal: in front of yellow, unlocked door.

Steps:

1. gotodoor red_door_1 room4 room2 (in room4)
2. toggle red_door_1 (unlock)
3. gotoroom room4 room2 red_door_1 (now in room2)
4. gotodoor purple_door_1 room2 room1 (in room2)
5. toggle purple_door_1 (unlock)
6. gotoroom room2 room1 purple_door_1 (now in room1)
7. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room1 room3 (in room1)
8. toggle yellow_door_1 (unlock) → now in front of unlocked yellow door (meets goal)
9. gotoroom room1 room3 yellow_door_1 (now in room3)
10. gotoobject grey_ball_2 room3
11. pick grey_ball_2 room3
12. gotodoor purple_door_2 room3 room4
13. toggle purple_door_2 (unlock)
14. gotoroom room3 room4 purple_door_2 (now in room4)
15. gotoempty
16. drop grey_ball_2 room4 → grey_ball_2 is now in room4
17. gotodoor purple_door_2 room4 room3 → now in front of purple_door_2 (constraint3 met)
18. gotoobject green_box_2 room4 → maybe not needed, but to free hands
19. pick green_box_2 room4 (optional? but need to be holding something to drop later)
But perhaps after step16, you can just proceed to other steps.

Now, check constraints:

- Constraint3: step17 (in front of purple_door_2).

- Constraint4: for step17, earlier state (step11) where held grey_ball_2.

- Constraint5: need blue_ball_2 in room4 or yellow_box_1 in room3. Currently, yellow_box_1 is in room1, blue_ball_2 in room3. So not met. So need to either move blue_ball_2 to room4 or yellow_box_1 to room3.

To move blue_ball_2 to room4:

19. gotoroom room4 room3 purple_door_2
20. gotoobject blue_ball_2 room3
21. pick blue_ball_2 room3
22. gotoroom room3 room4 purple_door_2
23. gotoempty
24. drop blue_ball_2 room4 → now constraint5 is met.

Alternatively, move yellow_box_1 to room3. But that would require going back to room1, picking it up, and moving it. But that's more steps.

But since we're already in room4 after step17, moving blue_ball_2 would be better.

After step24, blue_ball_2 is in room4, meeting constraint5.

Now, the goal was already met at step8. However, the problem requires the final goal to be achieved, but the plan must continue until all constraints are met. But the goal is a final state requirement, not a path requirement. So the plan can end once the goal is achieved and all constraints are satisfied in the process.

Wait, the problem says: "bring about the goal of the problem while satisfying all constraints". So the goal must be true in the final state, and all constraints must hold during the execution. So the final state must meet the goal, and during the plan, all constraints must be satisfied.

In the current steps, the goal is achieved at step8 (in front of yellow_door_1, unlocked). But the constraints require other things to happen. But the final state must be the goal, so the plan must end with the goal conditions. However, the constraints are about the entire execution path, not just the final state.

So the plan can have the goal achieved at step8, but then continue to meet other constraints, but the final state must still meet the goal. However, if after step8, you move away from the door, then the final state would not meet the goal. Therefore, the plan must end with the goal conditions. So the goal is to have a door d (yellow, unlocked, in front of it) in the final state.

So after step8, the goal is achieved, but we need to ensure that the final state is being in front of yellow_door_1, unlocked. But after step8, step9 moves to room3, so the final state would not be in front of yellow_door_1. Therefore, the plan must end at step8. But then, the other constraints (like being in front of purple_door_2) wouldn't be met. So this is a contradiction.

Wait, this is a problem. The goal is to have a final state where you are in front of an unlocked yellow door. So the last action must be such that you are in front of yellow_door_1, and it's unlocked.

But the constraints must be met during the plan. So the plan can have multiple steps, but the final state must meet the goal. So the plan must end with being in front of yellow_door_1, unlocked. But the other constraints must be met in earlier steps.

So perhaps the plan should:

- Unlock red_door_1, go to room2, unlock purple_door_1, go to room1, unlock yellow_door_1 and be in front of it (goal), but also ensure that all constraints are met before that.

But in this case, being in front of purple_door_2 (constraint3) requires going to room4's purple_door_2, which would require going back. But if the plan ends at room1's yellow_door_1, how to fulfill constraint3 and others?

This suggests that the plan needs to loop back to room4 after achieving the goal, but that would require the final state to not be the goal. Therefore, perhaps the optimal plan must achieve the goal last, after fulfilling all constraints.

Thus, the correct approach is to first fulfill all constraints, then achieve the goal as the final step.

Let me try to structure the plan accordingly:

1. From room4, go to red_door_1, unlock it.
2. Go to room2, unlock purple_door_1.
3. Go to room1, unlock yellow_door_1 (but not the final step yet).
4. Go to room3 via yellow_door_1.
5. Pick up grey_ball_2.
6. Go back to room4 via purple_door_2, unlock it, drop grey_ball_2.
7. Go to purple_door_2 again to fulfill constraint3.
8. Move blue_ball_2 to room4 for constraint5.
9. Finally, return to yellow_door_1 and be in front of it, unlocked.

But this would require a lot of steps. Let's outline:

1. gotodoor red_door_1 room4 room2
2. toggle red_door_1
3. gotoroom room4 room2 red_door_1 (now in room2)
4. gotodoor purple_door_1 room2 room1
5. toggle purple_door_1
6. gotoroom room2 room1 purple_door_1 (now in room1)
7. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room1 room3
8. toggle yellow_door_1 (now unlocked)
9. gotoroom room1 room3 yellow_door_1 (now in room3)
10. gotoobject grey_ball_2 room3
11. pick grey_ball_2 room3
12. gotodoor purple_door_2 room3 room4
13. toggle purple_door_2
14. gotoroom room3 room4 purple_door_2 (now in room4)
15. gotoempty
16. drop grey_ball_2 room4 (now grey_ball_2 in room4, constraint4 met)
17. gotodoor purple_door_2 room4 room3 (now in front of purple_door_2, constraint3 met)
18. gotoroom room4 room3 purple_door_2 (now in room3)
19. gotoobject blue_ball_2 room3
20. pick blue_ball_2 room3
21. gotoroom room3 room4 purple_door_2
22. gotoempty
23. drop blue_ball_2 room4 (constraint5 met)
24. gotoroom room4 room3 purple_door_2 (now in room3)
25. gotoroom room3 room1 yellow_door_1 (unlocked)
26. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room1 room3 (now in room1)
27. toggle yellow_door_1 (already unlocked)
28. Now in front of yellow_door_1, unlocked. This meets the goal.

But step27 is redundant. Alternatively, after step24, return to yellow_door_1:

24. gotoroom room4 room3 purple_door_2
25. gotoroom room3 room1 yellow_door_1
26. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room1 room3
27. Now in front of yellow_door_1, which is unlocked. So this is the final step.

But how to get back to room1 from room4 after step23:

After step23, you're in room4. To get to yellow_door_1:

24. gotodoor red_door_1 room4 room2
25. toggle red_door_1 (already unlocked)
26. gotoroom room4 room2 red_door_1
27. gotodoor purple_door_1 room2 room1
28. toggle purple_door_1 (already unlocked)
29. gotoroom room2 room1 purple_door_1
30. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room1 room3
31. Now in front of yellow_door_1, unlocked. So final step.

This way, the final state is in front of yellow_door_1, unlocked.

But this makes the plan very long. However, the problem asks for an optimal plan with minimal steps. So perhaps there's a shorter way.

Alternative approach:

Leverage the fact that constraint5 requires either blue_ball_2 in room4 or yellow_box_1 in room3. If we can move yellow_box_1 to room3 during the plan, that would satisfy constraint5.

So:

1. From room4, unlock red_door_1.
2. Go to room2, unlock purple_door_1.
3. Go to room1, unlock yellow_door_1.
4. Pick up yellow_box_1 in room1.
5. Go to room3 via yellow_door_1.
6. Drop yellow_box_1 in room3 (satisfies constraint5).
7. Go back to room1 via yellow_door_1.
8. Now, in front of yellow_door_1, which is unlocked. This meets the goal.

But need to check other constraints.

Constraint3: must be in front of purple_door_2. Not met in this plan.

So need to include that. So after step6, drop yellow_box_1 in room3, then:

7. gotoobject grey_ball_2 room3
8. pick grey_ball_2 room3
9. gotodoor purple_door_2 room3 room4
10. toggle purple_door_2
11. gotoroom room3 room4 purple_door_2 (now in room4)
12. drop grey_ball_2 room4 (constraint4 met)
13. gotodoor purple_door_2 room4 room3 (constraint3 met)
14. Now, need to return to yellow_door_1.

But this is getting complicated. The optimal plan must find the shortest path that meets all constraints and the goal.

Let me try to find the minimal steps:

- To satisfy constraint3: be in front of purple_door_2. This requires at least two actions (gotodoor and possibly toggle).

- To satisfy constraint4: when in front of purple_door_2, have earlier state with grey_ball_2 held or grey_box_1 in room4. So either carry grey_ball_2 to room4 or move grey_box_1 to room4.

- To satisfy constraint5: move blue_ball_2 to room4 or yellow_box_1 to room3.

- To satisfy constraint2: after being in room_4, be in front of purple_door_1.

Let's try to combine steps:

1. Start in room4. Unlock red_door_1 and go to room2.

Actions:

1. gotodoor red_door_1 room4 room2
2. toggle red_door_1
3. gotoroom room4 room2 red_door_1

Now in room2. Then unlock purple_door_1 and go to room1.

4. gotodoor purple_door_1 room2 room1
5. toggle purple_door_1
6. gotoroom room2 room1 purple_door_1

Now in room1. Unlock yellow_door_1.

7. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room1 room3
8. toggle yellow_door_1

Now in front of yellow_door_1, unlocked. This is the goal, but we need to ensure other constraints.

But we need to be in front of purple_door_2 (constraint3). So after step8, we need to go to room3, then to room4 via purple_door_2.

9. gotoroom room1 room3 yellow_door_1
10. pick grey_ball_2 room3
11. gotodoor purple_door_2 room3 room4
12. toggle purple_door_2
13. gotoroom room3 room4 purple_door_2
14. drop grey_ball_2 room4 (constraint4 met)
15. gotodoor purple_door_2 room4 room3 (constraint3 met)
16. Now, return to yellow_door_1 to meet the goal.

But how to return to yellow_door_1:

16. gotoroom room4 room3 purple_door_2
17. gotoroom room3 room1 yellow_door_1
18. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room1 room3
19. Now in front of yellow_door_1, unlocked. This is the final step.

But this makes many steps. Also, constraint5: either blue_ball_2 in room4 or yellow_box_1 in room3. In this plan, grey_ball_2 is in room4, and yellow_box_1 is still in room1. So constraint5 is not met. So need to add moving blue_ball_2 to room4:

After step15:

16. gotoroom room4 room3 purple_door_2
17. pick blue_ball_2 room3
18. gotoroom room3 room4 purple_door_2
19. drop blue_ball_2 room4 (constraint5 met)
20. Now, return to yellow_door_1:

20. gotoroom room4 room3 purple_door_2
21. gotoroom room3 room1 yellow_door_1
22. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room1 room3
23. Now in front of yellow_door_1, unlocked.

This is very long. But perhaps there's a shorter way.

Alternative Idea: Use the fact that moving grey_ball_2 to room4 satisfies both constraint4 and constraint5 (if blue_ball_2 is left in room3, but grey_ball_2 is in room4, but the fifth constraint requires blue_ball_2 in room4 or yellow_box_1 in room3. So moving grey_ball_2 doesn't help with constraint5. So we need to move either blue_ball_2 or yellow_box_1.

Therefore, the fifth constraint must be addressed separately.

Another Idea: Since yellow_box_1 is in room1, moving it to room3 would satisfy constraint5. So after unlocking yellow_door_1, pick up yellow_box_1 in room1, take it to room3, drop it. Then proceed.

Plan:

1. Unlock red_door_1, go to room2.
2. Unlock purple_door_1, go to room1.
3. Unlock yellow_door_1.
4. Pick up yellow_box_1 in room1.
5. Take it to room3, drop it.
6. Go back to yellow_door_1 to meet goal.
7. Also, fulfill other constraints.

But also need to handle purple_door_2.

Let's outline:

1. gotodoor red_door_1 room4 room2
2. toggle red_door_1
3. gotoroom room4 room2 red_door_1 (room2)
4. gotodoor purple_door_1 room2 room1
5. toggle purple_door_1
6. gotoroom room2 room1 purple_door_1 (room1)
7. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room1 room3
8. toggle yellow_door_1 (unlock)
9. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room1
10. pick yellow_box_1 room1
11. gotoroom room1 room3 yellow_door_1 (room3)
12. drop yellow_box_1 room3 (constraint5 met)
13. gotodoor purple_door_2 room3 room4
14. toggle purple_door_2
15. gotoroom room3 room4 purple_door_2 (room4)
16. gotodoor purple_door_2 room4 room3 (constraint3 met)
17. Now, need to be in front of yellow_door_1 again.

But how:

17. gotoroom room4 room3 purple_door_2
18. gotoroom room3 room1 yellow_door_1
19. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room1 room3
20. Now in front of yellow_door_1, unlocked (goal met)

But this plan includes:

- Constraint2: after initial room4, in step4, gotodoor purple_door_1 (in room2) which is front of purple_door_1. So satisfies constraint2.

- Constraint3: step16 (in front of purple_door_2)

- Constraint4: step16, must have earlier state with grey_ball_2 held or grey_box_1 in room4. But in this plan, neither is true. So constraint4 is not met. So this plan is invalid.

Ah, so even after moving yellow_box_1, we still need to address constraint4 when in front of purple_door_2.

So to fix this, after step15 (in room4), we need to either have grey_box_1 in room4 or have held grey_ball_2. In this plan, grey_box_1 is in room3, so need to pick up grey_ball_2:

After step12 (drop yellow_box_1 in room3):

13. gotoobject grey_ball_2 room3
14. pick grey_ball_2 room3
15. gotodoor purple_door_2 room3 room4
16. toggle purple_door_2
17. gotoroom room3 room4 purple_door_2 (room4)
18. drop grey_ball_2 room4 (now constraint4 met)
19. gotodoor purple_door_2 room4 room3 (constraint3 met)
20. Now, return to yellow_door_1:

20. gotoroom room4 room3 purple_door_2
21. gotoroom room3 room1 yellow_door_1
22. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room1 room3
23. in front of yellow_door_1, unlocked (goal)

This plan satisfies all constraints:

- constraint3: step19

- constraint4: step19 is in front of purple_door_2, and step14 held grey_ball_2.

- constraint5: step12 (yellow_box_1 in room3)

- constraint2: step4 (in front of purple_door_1 after initial room4)

This plan has 23 steps, but perhaps there's a shorter way.

Alternatively, after step18 (grey_ball_2 in room4), being in front of purple_door_2 (step19) satisfies constraint4, and then proceed to goal.

But this plan is quite long. The optimal plan should be the shortest possible. Let's see if there's a shorter path.

Alternative Plan:

1. From room4, go to purple_door_2 (room4 to room3), toggle to unlock.
2. Go to room3.
3. Pick up grey_ball_2.
4. Go back to room4, drop grey_ball_2 (satisfies constraint4).
5. Now in room4, go to purple_door_2 again (constraint3).
6. Then, go to red_door_1, unlock, go to room2, unlock purple_door_1, go to room1, unlock yellow_door_1, and be in front of it.

But this would require:

1. gotodoor purple_door_2 room4 room3 (step1)
   - But constraint4: before step1, need to have held grey_ball_2 or grey_box_1 in room4. But can't, so invalid.

So, this approach doesn't work.

Another Idea: Use the initial state in room4, and after some steps, return to room4 to fulfill the purple_door_1 constraint.

But the optimal plan must be as short as possible. Perhaps the minimal steps are:

- Unlock purple_door_2 from room4, pick grey_ball_2, drop in room4, then unlock yellow_door_1, etc. But this requires going through room3.

But again, the first step of going to purple_door_2 would trigger constraint4 without prior state.

So the minimal plan would involve:

1. Unlock red_door_1, go to room2.
2. Unlock purple_door_1, go to room1.
3. Unlock yellow_door_1, go to room3.
4. Pick grey_ball_2, return to room4 via purple_door_2 (unlock it), drop grey_ball_2.
5. Go to purple_door_2 again (constraint3).
6. Move blue_ball_2 to room4.
7. Return to yellow_door_1.

But this is lengthy. The optimal plan likely requires 20+ steps. Given the complexity, it's challenging to find a shorter plan. But perhaps there's a way to combine steps.

Final Plan:

```
1. gotodoor red_door_1 room4 room2
2. toggle red_door_1
3. gotoroom room4 room2 red_door_1
4. gotodoor purple_door_1 room2 room1
5. toggle purple_door_1
6. gotoroom room2 room1 purple_door_1
7. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room1 room3
8. toggle yellow_door_1
9. gotoroom room1 room3 yellow_door_1
10. gotoobject grey_ball_2 room3
11. pick grey_ball_2 room3
12. gotodoor purple_door_2 room3 room4
13. toggle purple_door_2
14. gotoroom room3 room4 purple_door_2
15. drop grey_ball_2 room4
16. gotodoor purple_door_2 room4 room3
17. gotoroom room4 room3 purple_door_2
18. gotoobject blue_ball_2 room3
19. pick blue_ball_2 room3
20. gotoroom room3 room4 purple_door_2
21. drop blue_ball_2 room4
22. gotoroom room4 room3 purple_door_2
23. gotoroom room3 room1 yellow_door_1
24. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room1 room3
```

But this ends in front of yellow_door_1, unlocked. However, step24 is the final action. But does this satisfy all constraints?

Check constraints:

- Constraint2: After initial room4 (step0), step4 is in front of purple_door_1 (room2), so satisfies.

- Constraint3: step16 (in front of purple_door_2).

- Constraint4: step16 requires earlier state with grey_ball_2 held or grey_box_1 in room4. Step11-15: carried grey_ball_2 and dropped in room4, so step15 satisfies.

- Constraint5: step21 drops blue_ball_2 in room4.

- Goal: step24, in front of yellow_door_1, which is unlocked (step8).

This seems to work. But the plan is long, and maybe there's a shorter way.

But given the constraints, this is likely the minimal steps required.
