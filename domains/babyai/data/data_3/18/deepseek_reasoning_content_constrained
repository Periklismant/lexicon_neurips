Okay, let's tackle this planning problem step by step. So, the goal is to end up in front of a grey ball. The initial state has me in room_3, and there's a grey_ball_1 in room_3. Wait, that's convenient! So maybe I can just go to that ball and drop it? Wait, no. Wait, the goal is to be in front of a grey ball. But grey_ball_1 is already in room_3 where I am. So maybe I can just go to it. But let me check the initial state again.

Initial state: I'm in room_3. grey_ball_1 is in room_3. So if I can go to grey_ball_1 in room_3, then pick it up? Wait, no, the goal is to be in front of it. Wait, the goal is "you are in front of v" where v is a grey ball. So maybe I just need to gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_3. But wait, can I do that?

But the actions have preconditions. The "gotoobject x r" requires that I am in the same room as x. Since I'm already in room_3, and grey_ball_1 is there, that should be possible. But why isn't the solution just that single action? Because maybe there are constraints that must be satisfied during the plan.

Ah right, the constraints. Let's look at the constraints:

1. At least once, green_door_1 is unlocked and I'm in front of yellow_ball_1.
2. At least once, either I'm holding something or grey_box_1 is in room_2.
3. At least once, either green_door_2 is unlocked or I'm in front of grey_box_1.

So even if the main goal can be achieved with one action, I need to ensure that all these constraints are met in the plan.

But how to fit those into the plan?

Let's break down each constraint:

First constraint: Need to be in front of yellow_ball_1 (which is in room_1) while green_door_1 is unlocked. But green_door_1 is initially locked. So I need to unlock it. But to toggle a door, I need to be in front of it. So perhaps I need to go to green_door_1, unlock it, then go to yellow_ball_1 in room_1. But how do I get to room_1? The initial room is room_3. The doors from room_3 are connected to room_1 (red_door_1) and room_4 (grey_door_1). But red_door_1 is locked. So maybe I need to unlock red_door_1 first.

Wait, the doors: room_1 and room_2 are connected via green_door_1 (locked). room_1 and room_3 via red_door_1 (locked). room_2 and room_4 via green_door_2 (locked). room_3 and room_4 via grey_door_1 (locked). All doors are initially locked.

So starting in room_3. To get to room_1, I need to go through red_door_1, but it's locked. So first, I need to go to red_door_1, toggle it to unlock, then go from room_3 to room_1 via red_door_1. But wait, the preconditions for gotoroom: need to be in a room adjacent, and the door connecting is unlocked. So if I unlock red_door_1, then I can go from room_3 to room_1.

But first, to toggle red_door_1, I need to be in front of it. So I need to be in room_3 (since red_door_1 connects room_3 and room_1). So from room_3, I can gotoempty to be in front of nothing, then gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1. Wait, the gotodoor action's arguments are d, r1, r2. So gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1. But the precondition for gotodoor is that I am in a room connected by d. Since I'm in room_3, and d connects room_3 and room_1, that's okay. But also, there's no object blocking the position in front of d in my current room. Are there any objects in front of the doors? The problem states that the rooms may include objects, but in the initial state, are any objects blocking doors?

Looking at the initial state, room_3 has grey_box_2, yellow_box_1, grey_ball_1, green_ball_2. Are any of these in front of doors? The problem doesn't specify positions, only that objects are in rooms. So perhaps by default, objects are not blocking doors unless stated. So assuming that in room_3, the doors (red_door_1 and grey_door_1) are not blocked by objects, so I can go to them.

So step 1: gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1. Then toggle red_door_1 to unlock it. Then gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1. Now I'm in room_1. Then, in room_1, I need to go to yellow_ball_1. But to satisfy the first constraint, during this plan, I need to have a state where green_door_1 is unlocked and I'm in front of yellow_ball_1. But green_door_1 is initially locked. So how to unlock it? Because green_door_1 connects room_1 and room_2. So to unlock green_door_1, I need to go to it in either room_1 or room_2 and toggle it. But currently, I'm in room_1. So from room_1, I can goto door green_door_1 room_1 room_2. Then toggle it. But that would unlock green_door_1. But then, perhaps during that process, after unlocking green_door_1, I can go to yellow_ball_1 in room_1. So the state where green_door_1 is unlocked and I'm in front of yellow_ball_1 would be after toggling green_door_1 and then going to yellow_ball_1. But wait, the constraint requires that in at least one state, both conditions hold. So the action sequence would be:

In room_1:

1. gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_2
2. toggle green_door_1 (now it's unlocked)
3. gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_1

At this point, the state after step 3 would satisfy the first constraint: green_door_1 is not locked, and I'm in front of yellow_ball_1.

But how do I get to room_1? Let's outline the steps:

Starting in room_3.

1. gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1
2. toggle red_door_1 (unlock)
3. gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1 (now in room_1)
4. gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_2
5. toggle green_door_1 (unlock)
6. gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_1

This sequence would satisfy the first constraint after step 6.

But then, the second constraint requires that at least once, either I'm holding an object or grey_box_1 is in room_2. Grey_box_1 is initially in room_1. So unless I move it, that condition can only be met if I'm holding something. So perhaps during the plan, I need to pick up an object at some point.

The third constraint requires that at least once, either green_door_2 is unlocked or I'm in front of grey_box_1. Green_door_2 is initially locked. So either I unlock green_door_2 or go in front of grey_box_1. But grey_box_1 is in room_1. So if I'm in room_1 and go to grey_box_1, that would satisfy that part of the constraint.

But let's see. Let's plan the steps to meet all constraints and the goal.

Main goal: be in front of a grey ball. The grey_ball_1 is in room_3. So perhaps after completing the constraints, I can return to room_3 and go to grey_ball_1.

But let's think through the steps.

Possible plan outline:

1. From room_3, unlock red_door_1 by going to it and toggling.
2. Move to room_1.
3. Unlock green_door_1 (to satisfy first constraint) and go to yellow_ball_1.
4. Then, pick up yellow_ball_1 (to satisfy the second constraint, holding something).
5. Then, perhaps go to grey_box_1 in room_1 (to satisfy third constraint, being in front of it).
6. Then, maybe move back to room_3 via red_door_1, drop the ball somewhere, then go to grey_ball_1.

Wait, but the main goal is to be in front of a grey ball, which is in room_3. So maybe after handling the constraints, return to room_3 and achieve the goal.

But let's check each step.

Starting in room_3.

Action 1: gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1 (precondition: in room_3, which I am. No object blocking. So allowed.)
Effect: in front of red_door_1.

Action 2: toggle red_door_1 (unlocks it)

Action 3: gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1 (now in room_1)

Now in room_1. Need to handle first constraint: have a state where green_door_1 is unlocked and in front of yellow_ball_1.

So:

Action 4: gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_2 (since green_door_1 connects room_1 and room_2)

Action 5: toggle green_door_1 (unlocks it)

Now green_door_1 is unlocked.

Action 6: gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_1 (now in front of yellow_ball_1, and green_door_1 is unlocked. This satisfies the first constraint.)

So after action 6, the first constraint is met.

Now, the second constraint: at least once, either holding something or grey_box_1 is in room_2. Since grey_box_1 is in room_1, unless we move it, we need to hold something. So perhaps pick up yellow_ball_1 here.

Action 7: pick yellow_ball_1 room_1 (preconditions: in same room, not holding anything. Yes.)

Now, holding yellow_ball_1. This satisfies the second constraint (holding an object) at this state.

Third constraint: at least once, green_door_2 is unlocked or in front of grey_box_1. Grey_box_1 is in room_1. So if we go to it, that would satisfy the third constraint.

Action 8: gotoobject grey_box_1 room_1 (now in front of it. So the third constraint is met here.)

So after action 8, all constraints are met.

Now, need to achieve the main goal: be in front of a grey ball. The grey_ball_1 is in room_3. So need to return to room_3.

But I'm in room_1, holding yellow_ball_1. To go back to room_3, I can use red_door_1, which is unlocked.

Action 9: gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3 (but wait, red_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3. So from room_1, gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3.

Action 9: gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3

Action 10: gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1 (now back in room_3)

But I'm holding yellow_ball_1. Need to drop it somewhere to be able to pick up the grey_ball_1? Wait, no. The goal is to be in front of a grey ball, which is already in room_3. So perhaps I can just go to grey_ball_1.

But to go to an object, I need to be in the same room. So in room_3, I can:

Action 11: gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_3

But I'm holding yellow_ball_1. The gotoobject action's preconditions don't require hands to be empty, just that I'm in the same room as the object. So yes, allowed.

Wait, but after dropping the yellow_ball_1, perhaps. Let's think: after returning to room_3, I'm holding yellow_ball_1. To drop it, I need to be in front of an empty position. So maybe:

Action 11: gotoempty (since dropping requires being in front of an empty spot)

Action 12: drop yellow_ball_1 room_3

Then, gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_3.

But maybe there's a shorter path.

Alternatively, once back in room_3, I can drop the yellow_ball_1 here, then go to the grey_ball_1.

So:

Action 9: gotoempty (in room_1, but wait, no. After action 8, I'm in front of grey_box_1 in room_1. Then action 9 is gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3.

Wait, let me correct the steps. Let's retrace:

After action 8 (in front of grey_box_1 in room_1), need to go back to room_3.

So:

Action 9: gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3 (precondition: in room_1, which I am. No object blocking. So allowed.)

Action 10: gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1 (now in room_3)

Now, in room_3, holding yellow_ball_1. To drop it, I need to be in front of an empty position. So:

Action 11: gotoempty (in room_3)

Action 12: drop yellow_ball_1 room_3

Now, not holding anything. Then:

Action 13: gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_3 (now in front of it. Goal achieved.)

But that's 13 steps. But maybe there's a shorter way. Let's see.

Wait, after returning to room_3, maybe I can drop the yellow_ball_1 in room_3 without going to empty first? Because to drop, the precondition is that I'm holding x, and the position in front is empty. But after moving to room_3 via gotoroom, I'm no longer in front of anything. So after action 10 (gotoroom), I'm in room_3, not in front of anything. So to drop, I need to be in front of an empty position. So gotoempty, then drop.

Alternatively, perhaps after returning to room_3, I can drop the ball immediately. Wait, the drop action's precondition is that the position in front is empty. But when you perform gotoroom, you are no longer in front of anything. So to drop, you need to be in front of an empty spot.

So steps 11 and 12 are necessary.

But maybe instead of dropping the ball, can I just go to grey_ball_1 while holding it? Because the goal is to be in front of a grey ball, regardless of holding anything. So perhaps:

After action 10 (back in room_3, holding yellow_ball_1), then:

Action 11: gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_3

But can I do that while holding another object? The gotoobject action's preconditions are only that I'm in the same room as x. So yes. So that would achieve the goal. Then, the final state would have me in front of grey_ball_1, holding yellow_ball_1. But the goal doesn't require not holding anything, just being in front of a grey ball. So that would satisfy the goal. Then, steps 9-11 would be:

9. gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3

10. gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1

11. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_3

But in this case, the drop isn't needed. That saves two steps (steps 11 and 12 in the previous plan). So total steps would be 11. But need to check if that's allowed.

Yes, because the preconditions for gotoobject are met: I'm in room_3, same as grey_ball_1. Holding an object is allowed; the gotoobject action doesn't require empty hands.

So the plan would be:

1. gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1

2. toggle red_door_1

3. gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1

4. gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_2

5. toggle green_door_1

6. gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_1

7. pick yellow_ball_1 room_1

8. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_1

9. gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3

10. gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1

11. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_3

This gives 11 actions. Let's check constraints:

First constraint: At some state, green_door_1 is unlocked and in front of yellow_ball_1. This occurs after action 6 (after toggling green_door_1 and going to yellow_ball_1). But wait, action 5 toggles green_door_1 (unlocking it). Then action 6 is gotoobject yellow_ball_1. So in the state after action 6, green_door_1 is unlocked, and in front of yellow_ball_1. Correct.

Second constraint: At some state, holding something or grey_box_1 in room_2. After action 7 (pick), holding yellow_ball_1. So that's satisfied.

Third constraint: At some state, green_door_2 is unlocked or in front of grey_box_1. Action 8 is gotoobject grey_box_1 in room_1, so that's satisfied.

All constraints are met. The final action (11) places me in front of grey_ball_1. So the goal is achieved.

Is this the shortest possible plan? Let's see if any steps can be skipped.

For example, after step 7 (picking up yellow_ball_1), do I need to go to grey_box_1 (step 8) to satisfy the third constraint? Yes, because the third constraint requires being in front of grey_box_1 or green_door_2 unlocked. Since green_door_2 is still locked, unless we unlock it, which would require going to room_2 or room_4. But that's more steps. So going to grey_box_1 is more efficient.

So the steps are necessary. Hence, this plan should be optimal.
