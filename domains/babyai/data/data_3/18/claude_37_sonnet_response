Alright, I need to solve this planning problem. Let me start by understanding the goal, constraints, and the initial state.

**Goal:**
- I need to be in front of the grey ball (`grey_ball_1`).

**Constraints:**
1. At some point, `green_door_1` must be unlocked and I must be in front of `yellow_ball_1`.
2. At some point, either I must be holding some object or `grey_box_1` must be in `room_2`.
3. At some point, either `green_door_2` must be unlocked or I must be in front of `grey_box_1`.

**Initial State:**
- I am in `room_3`.
- `grey_ball_1` is in `room_3`.
- All doors are locked.
- I am not holding any object.

Let's think about the plan:

1. First, I need to achieve the goal of being in front of `grey_ball_1`. Since both are already in the same room (`room_3`), I can just go to it:
   - `gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_3`

But I also need to satisfy the constraints:

**Constraint 1:** I need to ensure that at some point `green_door_1` is unlocked and I am in front of `yellow_ball_1`. 
Since `yellow_ball_1` is in `room_1` and `green_door_1` connects `room_1` and `room_2`, I need to:
- Go to `red_door_1`, which connects `room_3` and `room_1`.
- Toggle `red_door_1` to unlock it.
- Go to `room_1` from `room_3` using `red_door_1`.
- Go to `green_door_1` in `room_1`.
- Toggle `green_door_1` to unlock it.
- Go to `yellow_ball_1` in `room_1`.

**Constraint 2:** I need to ensure that at some point either I am holding an object or `grey_box_1` is in `room_2`. 
Since `grey_box_1` is in `room_1`, I could either move it to `room_2` or simply pick up any object. Moving `grey_box_1` to `room_2` would require:
- Going to `grey_box_1` in `room_1`.
- Picking it up.
- Going to `green_door_1`.
- Going to `room_2` from `room_1` using `green_door_1`.
- Dropping `grey_box_1` in `room_2`.

Alternatively, I could pick up any object and satisfy the constraint that way. Given the previous actions, I might pick up `yellow_ball_1` in `room_1` after fulfilling constraint 1.

**Constraint 3:** I need to ensure that at some point either `green_door_2` is unlocked or I am in front of `grey_box_1`. 
Given the actions for constraint 2, I'd already be in front of `grey_box_1` in `room_1`.

Let me try to create a plan that satisfies all constraints and the goal:

1. `gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1` - Go in front of the door connecting `room_3` and `room_1`.
2. `toggle red_door_1` - Unlock the door.
3. `gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1` - Go to `room_1` from `room_3` using the unlocked door.
4. `gotoobject grey_box_1 room_1` - Go in front of `grey_box_1` in `room_1`. (This satisfies Constraint 3)
5. `pick grey_box_1 room_1` - Pick up `grey_box_1`. (This satisfies Constraint 2)
6. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_2` - Go in front of the door connecting `room_1` and `room_2`.
7. `toggle green_door_1` - Unlock the door.
8. `gotoempty` - Go to an empty position.
9. `drop grey_box_1 room_1` - Drop `grey_box_1` in `room_1`.
10. `gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_1` - Go in front of `yellow_ball_1` in `room_1`. (This satisfies Constraint 1, along with the unlocked `green_door_1`)
11. `gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3` - Go in front of the door connecting `room_1` and `room_3`.
12. `gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1` - Go back to `room_3` from `room_1` using the unlocked door.
13. `gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_3` - Go in front of `grey_ball_1` in `room_3`. (This satisfies the goal)

Let me check this plan:

- Goal is achieved at the end.
- Constraint 1 is satisfied at step 10, after `green_door_1` is unlocked and I am in front of `yellow_ball_1`.
- Constraint 2 is satisfied at step 5, when I am holding `grey_box_1`.
- Constraint 3 is satisfied at step 4, when I am in front of `grey_box_1`.

Wait, let me review the preconditions for the actions:

For `gotodoor`:
I may only go in front of a door d if (i) I am in a room which door d is connecting with another room, and (ii) there is no object blocking the position in front of d in the room you are currently in.

For `toggle`:
I may only toggle a door d if I am in front of d.

For `gotoroom`:
I may only go in a room r if (i) I am currently in a room r0 that is adjacent to r, and (ii) the door that is connecting r0 and r is unlocked.

For `gotoobject`:
I may only go in front of an object x if I am in the same room as x.

For `pick`:
I may only pick up an object x if (i) I am in the same room as x, and (ii) I am currently not holding any object.

For `gotoempty`:
I may go in front of an empty position anytime.

For `drop`:
I may only drop an object x if (i) I am currently holding x, and (ii) the position in front of you is empty.

My plan looks correct in terms of these preconditions. However, I think I should simplify it:

1. `gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1` - Go in front of the door connecting `room_3` and `room_1`.
2. `toggle red_door_1` - Unlock the door.
3. `gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1` - Go to `room_1` from `room_3` using the unlocked door.
4. `gotoobject grey_box_1 room_1` - Go in front of `grey_box_1` in `room_1`. (This satisfies Constraint 3)
5. `pick grey_box_1 room_1` - Pick up `grey_box_1`. (This satisfies Constraint 2)
6. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_2` - Go in front of the door connecting `room_1` and `room_2`.
7. `toggle green_door_1` - Unlock the door.
8. `gotoempty` - Go to an empty position.
9. `drop grey_box_1 room_1` - Drop `grey_box_1` in `room_1`.
10. `gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_1` - Go in front of `yellow_ball_1` in `room_1`. (This satisfies Constraint 1, along with the unlocked `green_door_1`)
11. `gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3` - Go in front of the door connecting `room_1` and `room_3`.
12. `gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1` - Go back to `room_3` from `room_1` using the unlocked door.
13. `gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_3` - Go in front of `grey_ball_1` in `room_3`. (This satisfies the goal)

Actually, the original plan seems fine. Let's double-check:

Step 1: `gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1`
Preconditions: I'm in `room_3` and `red_door_1` connects `room_3` and `room_1`. No objects are blocking the door (not explicitly stated, so I assume it's true).
Effects: I'm in front of `red_door_1`.

Step 2: `toggle red_door_1`
Preconditions: I'm in front of `red_door_1`.
Effects: `red_door_1` becomes unlocked.

Step 3: `gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1`
Preconditions: I'm in `room_3`, which is adjacent to `room_1`. `red_door_1` connects them and is unlocked.
Effects: I'm now in `room_1` and I've visited `room_1`. I'm no longer in front of `red_door_1`.

Step 4: `gotoobject grey_box_1 room_1`
Preconditions: I'm in `room_1` and `grey_box_1` is in `room_1`.
Effects: I'm in front of `grey_box_1`. (This satisfies Constraint 3)

Step 5: `pick grey_box_1 room_1`
Preconditions: I'm in front of `grey_box_1` and my hands are empty.
Effects: I'm holding `grey_box_1`, my hands are not empty, and `grey_box_1` is no longer in `room_1`. (This satisfies Constraint 2)

Step 6: `gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_2`
Preconditions: I'm in `room_1` and `green_door_1` connects `room_1` and `room_2`. No objects are blocking the door.
Effects: I'm in front of `green_door_1`.

Step 7: `toggle green_door_1`
Preconditions: I'm in front of `green_door_1`.
Effects: `green_door_1` becomes unlocked.

Step 8: `gotoempty`
Preconditions: None.
Effects: I'm in front of an empty position.

Step 9: `drop grey_box_1 room_1`
Preconditions: I'm holding `grey_box_1` and I'm in front of an empty position.
Effects: I'm no longer holding `grey_box_1`, my hands are empty, and `grey_box_1` is in `room_1`.

Step 10: `gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_1`
Preconditions: I'm in `room_1` and `yellow_ball_1` is in `room_1`.
Effects: I'm in front of `yellow_ball_1`. (This, along with the unlocked `green_door_1`, satisfies Constraint 1)

Step 11: `gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3`
Preconditions: I'm in `room_1` and `red_door_1` connects `room_1` and `room_3`. No objects are blocking the door.
Effects: I'm in front of `red_door_1`.

Step 12: `gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1`
Preconditions: I'm in `room_1`, which is adjacent to `room_3`. `red_door_1` connects them and is unlocked.
Effects: I'm now in `room_3`. I'm no longer in front of `red_door_1`.

Step 13: `gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_3`
Preconditions: I'm in `room_3` and `grey_ball_1` is in `room_3`.
Effects: I'm in front of `grey_ball_1`. (This satisfies the goal)

Oops, let me rethink this. I think I made a mistake with the constraint 2. It states: "The following expression must hold in at least one state: At least one of the following conditions is true: 'you are holding some object', 'grey_box_1 is in room_2'"

Currently, in my plan, `grey_box_1` doesn't end up in `room_2`; it stays in `room_1`. I need to modify the plan:

1. `gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1` - Go in front of the door connecting `room_3` and `room_1`.
2. `toggle red_door_1` - Unlock the door.
3. `gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1` - Go to `room_1` from `room_3` using the unlocked door.
4. `gotoobject grey_box_1 room_1` - Go in front of `grey_box_1` in `room_1`. (This satisfies Constraint 3)
5. `pick grey_box_1 room_1` - Pick up `grey_box_1`. (This already satisfies Constraint 2 because I'm holding `grey_box_1`)
6. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_2` - Go in front of the door connecting `room_1` and `room_2`.
7. `toggle green_door_1` - Unlock the door.
8. `gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_1` - Go in front of `yellow_ball_1` in `room_1`. (This satisfies Constraint 1, along with the unlocked `green_door_1`)
9. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_2` - Go back to the door.
10. `gotoroom room_1 room_2 green_door_1` - Go to `room_2` from `room_1` using the unlocked door.
11. `gotoempty` - Go to an empty position.
12. `drop grey_box_1 room_2` - Drop `grey_box_1` in `room_2`.
13. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_1` - Go to the door in `room_2`.
14. `gotoroom room_2 room_1 green_door_1` - Go back to `room_1`.
15. `gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3` - Go to the door in `room_1`.
16. `gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1` - Go back to `room_3`.
17. `gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_3` - Go in front of `grey_ball_1` in `room_3`. (This satisfies the goal)

Actually I'm making this more complicated than it needs to be. Let me think about the constraints again:

Constraint 2: "At some point, either I must be holding some object OR `grey_box_1` must be in `room_2`." 

In the original plan, I satisfy this constraint by holding `grey_box_1`. I don't need to also move it to `room_2`. The constraint is satisfied after I pick up `grey_box_1`. But if I want to optimize, maybe I should drop grey_box_1 somewhere.

Let me revise the plan:

1. `gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1` - Go in front of the door connecting `room_3` and `room_1`.
2. `toggle red_door_1` - Unlock the door.
3. `gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1` - Go to `room_1` from `room_3` using the unlocked door.
4. `gotoobject grey_box_1 room_1` - Go in front of `grey_box_1` in `room_1`. (This satisfies Constraint 3)
5. `pick grey_box_1 room_1` - Pick up `grey_box_1`. (This satisfies Constraint 2 because I'm holding an object)
6. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_2` - Go in front of the door connecting `room_1` and `room_2`.
7. `toggle green_door_1` - Unlock the door.
8. `gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_1` - Go in front of `yellow_ball_1` in `room_1`. (This satisfies Constraint 1, along with the unlocked `green_door_1`)
9. `gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3` - Go in front of the door connecting `room_1` and `room_3`.
10. `gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1` - Go back to `room_3` from `room_1` using the unlocked door.
11. `gotoempty` - Go to an empty position.
12. `drop grey_box_1 room_3` - Drop `grey_box_1` in `room_3`.
13. `gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_3` - Go in front of `grey_ball_1` in `room_3`. (This satisfies the goal)

All constraints are satisfied, and the goal is achieved. This plan seems optimal to me.

However, I'm now realizing that there might be an issue with step 8. I need to go to yellow_ball_1 in room_1, but if I'm holding grey_box_1, the ball might not be visible or accessible. Let me rethink this.

Actually, I'm just overthinking it. If I'm holding grey_box_1, I can still go to the position where yellow_ball_1 is; it's just an action to move to a position in the room.

Let me review this plan one more time:

Step 1: `gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1`
Preconditions: I'm in `room_3` and `red_door_1` connects `room_3` and `room_1`. No objects are blocking the door.
Effects: I'm in front of `red_door_1`.

Step 2: `toggle red_door_1`
Preconditions: I'm in front of `red_door_1`.
Effects: `red_door_1` becomes unlocked.

Step 3: `gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1`
Preconditions: I'm in `room_3`, which is adjacent to `room_1`. `red_door_1` connects them and is unlocked.
Effects: I'm now in `room_1` and I've visited `room_1`. I'm no longer in front of `red_door_1`.

Step 4: `gotoobject grey_box_1 room_1`
Preconditions: I'm in `room_1` and `grey_box_1` is in `room_1`.
Effects: I'm in front of `grey_box_1`. (This satisfies Constraint 3)

Step 5: `pick grey_box_1 room_1`
Preconditions: I'm in front of `grey_box_1` and my hands are empty.
Effects: I'm holding `grey_box_1`, my hands are not empty, and `grey_box_1` is no longer in `room_1`. (This satisfies Constraint 2)

Step 6: `gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_2`
Preconditions: I'm in `room_1` and `green_door_1` connects `room_1` and `room_2`. No objects are blocking the door.
Effects: I'm in front of `green_door_1`.

Step 7: `toggle green_door_1`
Preconditions: I'm in front of `green_door_1`.
Effects: `green_door_1` becomes unlocked.

Step 8: `gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_1`
Preconditions: I'm in `room_1` and `yellow_ball_1` is in `room_1`.
Effects: I'm in front of `yellow_ball_1`. (This, along with the unlocked `green_door_1`, satisfies Constraint 1)

Step 9: `gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3`
Preconditions: I'm in `room_1` and `red_door_1` connects `room_1` and `room_3`. No objects are blocking the door.
Effects: I'm in front of `red_door_1`.

Step 10: `gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1`
Preconditions: I'm in `room_1`, which is adjacent to `room_3`. `red_door_1` connects them and is unlocked.
Effects: I'm now in `room_3`. I'm no longer in front of `red_door_1`.

Step 11: `gotoempty`
Preconditions: None.
Effects: I'm in front of an empty position.

Step 12: `drop grey_box_1 room_3`
Preconditions: I'm holding `grey_box_1` and I'm in front of an empty position.
Effects: I'm no longer holding `grey_box_1`, my hands are empty, and `grey_box_1` is in `room_3`.

Step 13: `gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_3`
Preconditions: I'm in `room_3` and `grey_ball_1` is in `room_3`.
Effects: I'm in front of `grey_ball_1`. (This satisfies the goal)

All of the preconditions and effects seem correct. All constraints are satisfied, and the goal is achieved. This plan is valid and quite efficient.

Actually, let me think about this one more time.

Goal: I need to be in front of `grey_ball_1`.
Grey_ball_1 is in room_3, and I start in room_3.

So I could just satisfy this goal directly by doing:
`gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_3`

But I also need to satisfy the three constraints.

Constraint 1: At some point, `green_door_1` must be unlocked and I must be in front of `yellow_ball_1`.
Given:
- `green_door_1` connects `room_1` and `room_2`.
- `yellow_ball_1` is in `room_1`.

To satisfy this, I need to:
- Go to `room_1`.
- Unlock `green_door_1`.
- Go in front of `yellow_ball_1`.

Constraint 2: At some point, either I must be holding some object or `grey_box_1` must be in `room_2`.
Given:
- `grey_box_1` is in `room_1`.

To satisfy this, I could:
- Pick up any object.
OR
- Move `grey_box_1` to `room_2`.

Constraint 3: At some point, either `green_door_2` must be unlocked or I must be in front of `grey_box_1`.
Given:
- `green_door_2` connects `room_2` and `room_4`.
- `grey_box_1` is in `room_1`.

To satisfy this, I could:
- Unlock `green_door_2`.
OR
- Go in front of `grey_box_1`.

Based on these, here's a revised plan that satisfies all constraints efficiently:

1. `gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1` - Go in front of the door connecting `room_3` and `room_1`.
2. `toggle red_door_1` - Unlock the door.
3. `gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1` - Go to `room_1` from `room_3` using the unlocked door.
4. `gotoobject grey_box_1 room_1` - Go in front of `grey_box_1` in `room_1`. (This satisfies Constraint 3)
5. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_2` - Go in front of the door connecting `room_1` and `room_2`.
6. `toggle green_door_1` - Unlock the door.
7. `gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_1` - Go in front of `yellow_ball_1` in `room_1`. (This satisfies Constraint 1, along with the unlocked `green_door_1`)
8. `pick yellow_ball_1 room_1` - Pick up `yellow_ball_1`. (This satisfies Constraint 2 because I'm holding an object)
9. `gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3` - Go in front of the door connecting `room_1` and `room_3`.
10. `gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1` - Go back to `room_3` from `room_1` using the unlocked door.
11. `gotoempty` - Go to an empty position.
12. `drop yellow_ball_1 room_3` - Drop `yellow_ball_1` in `room_3`. (Now I can satisfy the goal)
13. `gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_3` - Go in front of `grey_ball_1` in `room_3`. (This satisfies the goal)

I'm not sure if this is more efficient than my previous plan, but it does the job with essentially the same number of steps.

Actually, I was overthinking it. Let's simplify the plan:

1. `gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1` - Go in front of the door connecting `room_3` and `room_1`.
2. `toggle red_door_1` - Unlock the door.
3. `gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1` - Go to `room_1` from `room_3` using the unlocked door.
4. `gotoobject grey_box_1 room_1` - Go in front of `grey_box_1` in `room_1`. (This satisfies Constraint 3)
5. `pick grey_box_1 room_1` - Pick up `grey_box_1`. (This satisfies Constraint 2 because I'm holding an object)
6. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_2` - Go in front of the door connecting `room_1` and `room_2`.
7. `toggle green_door_1` - Unlock the door.
8. `gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_1` - Go in front of `yellow_ball_1` in `room_1`. (This satisfies Constraint 1, along with the unlocked `green_door_1`)
9. `gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3` - Go in front of the door connecting `room_1` and `room_3`.
10. `gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1` - Go back to `room_3` from `room_1` using the unlocked door.
11. `gotoempty` - Go to an empty position.
12. `drop grey_box_1 room_3` - Drop `grey_box_1` in `room_3`.
13. `gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_3` - Go in front of `grey_ball_1` in `room_3`. (This satisfies the goal)

This seems like the most efficient plan to satisfy all constraints and achieve the goal.

Actually, one more time. Let me try to minimize the number of steps as much as possible.

Goal: I need to be in front of `grey_ball_1`, which is already in the same room as me (`room_3`).

Constraint 1: At some point, `green_door_1` (which connects `room_1` and `room_2`) must be unlocked and I must be in front of `yellow_ball_1` (which is in `room_1`).

Constraint 2: At some point, either I must be holding some object or `grey_box_1` (which is in `room_1`) must be in `room_2`.

Constraint 3: At some point, either `green_door_2` (which connects `room_2` and `room_4`) must be unlocked or I must be in front of `grey_box_1` (which is in `room_1`).

To minimize the number of steps, I should try to satisfy multiple constraints simultaneously whenever possible.

Let's start by going to `room_1`:
1. `gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1` - Go in front of the door connecting `room_3` and `room_1`.
2. `toggle red_door_1` - Unlock the door.
3. `gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1` - Go to `room_1` from `room_3` using the unlocked door.

Now, let's try to satisfy as many constraints as possible while in `room_1`:

4. `gotoobject grey_box_1 room_1` - Go in front of `grey_box_1` in `room_1`. (This satisfies Constraint 3)
5. `pick grey_box_1 room_1` - Pick up `grey_box_1`. (This satisfies Constraint 2 because I'm holding an object)
6. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_2` - Go in front of the door connecting `room_1` and `room_2`.
7. `toggle green_door_1` - Unlock the door.
8. `gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_1` - Go in front of `yellow_ball_1` in `room_1`. (This satisfies Constraint 1, along with the unlocked `green_door_1`)

Now, let's return to `room_3` to satisfy the goal:

9. `gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3` - Go in front of the door connecting `room_1` and `room_3`.
10. `gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1` - Go back to `room_3` from `room_1` using the unlocked door.

I need to drop the box before I can go to the grey ball (since the goal is to be in front of the grey ball, not holding it):

11. `gotoempty` - Go to an empty position.
12. `drop grey_box_1 room_3` - Drop `grey_box_1` in `room_3`.
13. `gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_3` - Go in front of `grey_ball_1` in `room_3`. (This satisfies the goal)

So the final plan is:

1. `gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1`
2. `toggle red_door_1`
3. `gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1`
4. `gotoobject grey_box_1 room_1`
5. `pick grey_box_1 room_1`
6. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_2`
7. `toggle green_door_1`
8. `gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_1`
9. `gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3`
10. `gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1`
11. `gotoempty`
12. `drop grey_box_1 room_3`
13. `gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_3`

This plan satisfies all constraints and achieves the goal in 13 steps. I think this is the most efficient plan for this scenario.

Let's make sure I'm clear on the plan:

Constraints:
1. At some point, green_door_1 is unlocked and I'm in front of yellow_ball_1. ✅ Steps 7 and 8.
2. At some point, I'm either holding an object or grey_box_1 is in room_2. ✅ Steps 5-10 (I'm holding grey_box_1).
3. At some point, either green_door_2 is unlocked or I'm in front of grey_box_1. ✅ Step 4.

Goal: I'm in front of grey_ball_1. ✅ Step 13.

All constraints and the goal are satisfied with this plan. It seems efficient and straightforward.

Plan:
1. `gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1`
2. `toggle red_door_1`
