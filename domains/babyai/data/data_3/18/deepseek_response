This plan satisfies all constraints and achieves the goal in minimal steps:
1. Unlocks red_door_1 and green_door_1 to enable movement between rooms
2. Positions in front of yellow_ball_1 while green_door_1 is unlocked (constraint 1)
3. Picks yellow_ball_1 (satisfies constraint 2 via holding)
4. Moves to grey_box_1 (satisfies constraint 3)
5. Returns to room_3 and positions in front of grey_ball_1 to achieve the goal
