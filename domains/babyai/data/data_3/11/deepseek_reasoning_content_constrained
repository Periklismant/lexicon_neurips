Okay, let's tackle this planning problem step by step. First, I need to understand the initial state, the goal, and the constraints. Let me start by listing everything out.

The initial state has the agent in room_2. All doors are locked, which is important. The doors are yellow_door_1 (connects room_1 and 2), purple_door_1 (room_1 and 3), green_door_1 (room_2 and 4), and yellow_door_2 (room_3 and 4). The objects are spread across the rooms: room_1 has green_box_1 and yellow_ball_1, room_2 has purple_box_1, room_3 has blue_ball_1, green_box_2, yellow_ball_2, and room_4 has purple_box_2 and blue_box_1.

The goal is to have a blue ball (so blue_ball_1 or blue_box_1? Wait, blue_ball_1 is in room_3, and blue_box_1 is in room_4. But the goal specifies "a ball v" that's blue, so it's blue_ball_1. The agent needs to be in front of this blue ball.

Constraints:
1. purple_door_1 must always be locked. So we can't unlock it. That means the agent can't use purple_door_1 to move between room_1 and room_3. But since one of the constraints is that the agent must never be in room_1, that's already covered. So purple_door_1 is locked and stays locked, which is okay because we can't go to room_1 anyway.
2. The agent must never be in room_1. So all actions must avoid entering room_1.
3. The agent must be in room_3 at least once. So the plan must include entering room_3.
4. If the agent is in room_3 in some state, there must be an earlier state where they were in front of yellow_ball_2 or an empty position. So before entering room_3, the agent must have been in front of either yellow_ball_2 (which is in room_3, but that can't be before entering room_3) or an empty position. Wait, that's confusing. Wait, the agent starts in room_2. To get to room_3, they need to go through room_1 via purple_door_1, but that's locked and they can't enter room_1. Alternatively, maybe via room_4? Let me check the room connections. Room_2 is connected to room_4 via green_door_1. Room_4 is connected to room_3 via yellow_door_2. So the path from room_2 to room_3 would be room_2 -> room_4 (through green_door_1), then room_4 -> room_3 (through yellow_door_2). But all doors are initially locked, so the agent needs to unlock them first.

But let's check the doors. The doors are yellow_door_1 (locked), purple_door_1 (locked), green_door_1 (locked), yellow_door_2 (locked). So to move from room_2 to room_4, the agent needs to unlock green_door_1. Then from room_4 to room_3 via yellow_door_2, which is also locked. So they need to unlock yellow_door_2 as well.

But the agent starts in room_2. Let's outline the steps needed:

1. Unlock green_door_1 to go from room_2 to room_4.
2. Go to room_4.
3. Unlock yellow_door_2 to go from room_4 to room_3.
4. Go to room_3.
5. In room_3, go to blue_ball_1 and be in front of it.

But the constraints require that if the agent is in room_3, there must be an earlier state where they were in front of yellow_ball_2 or an empty position. Since yellow_ball_2 is in room_3, the agent can't be in front of it before entering room_3. Therefore, the agent must have been in front of an empty position before entering room_3. So, before going to room_3, the agent needs to perform a "gotoempty" action in their current room (which could be room_4) before moving to room_3.

Wait, the constraint says that if the agent is in room_3 in some state, there must be an earlier state where they were in front of yellow_ball_2 or empty. Since yellow_ball_2 is in room_3, the only way to satisfy this is if, before entering room_3, the agent was in front of an empty position. So in room_4, before moving to room_3 via yellow_door_2, the agent needs to do a "gotoempty" in room_4, then "gotodoor" to the door, then "toggle" it, then "gotoroom" to room_3. Alternatively, maybe when moving through the door, they need to be in front of the door, but to toggle it, they need to be in front of it. Let's think.

Let's outline the steps:

Starting in room_2.

First, need to unlock green_door_1. To do that, the agent must go to the door (which connects room_2 and room_4). But the preconditions for "gotodoor d r1 r2" are that the agent is in a room connected by d, and no object is blocking the position in front of d in the current room. The doors in room_2 are yellow_door_1 (to room_1) and green_door_1 (to room_4). Since the agent is in room_2, to go to green_door_1, they need to use "gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4". But is there an object blocking the door? The initial state in room_2 has purple_box_1. But the problem statement doesn't mention any objects blocking doors. Wait, the problem says that "goto door" requires that there's no object blocking the position in front of d in the current room. So we need to check if any objects are in front of the doors. But the initial state doesn't state that any objects are blocking doors. So perhaps the doors are not blocked initially. So the agent can "gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4" from room_2.

So steps:

1. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4 (from room_2)
2. toggle green_door_1 (unlocks it)
3. gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1 (move to room_4)
4. Now in room_4. Need to unlock yellow_door_2 to get to room_3.
5. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_3 (since the agent is in room_4)
6. toggle yellow_door_2 (unlocks it)
7. gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_2 (move to room_3)
8. Now in room_3. But the constraint says that if the agent is in room_3, there must have been a prior state where they were in front of yellow_ball_2 or empty. But yellow_ball_2 is in room_3, so the agent can't be in front of it before entering room_3. Therefore, before moving to room_3, the agent must have been in front of an empty position. So in room_4, before step 7, the agent needs to do a "gotoempty" in room_4. So inserting steps:

After step 6 (toggle yellow_door_2), the agent is in front of yellow_door_2 in room_4. Then, before moving to room_3, they need to go to an empty position. So:

6.5: gotoempty (in room_4)
7. Then, gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_3 again? Or can they go directly from being in front of empty to the door again?

Wait, the agent is in room_4. After toggling the door, they are in front of the door. To go to room_3, they need to be in front of the door to use gotoroom. But the constraint requires that before entering room_3, they were in front of empty. So perhaps the sequence would be:

After unlocking yellow_door_2 (step 6), the agent is in front of the door. Then, they need to go to an empty position in room_4 (step 7: gotoempty), which satisfies the condition that before entering room_3, they were in front of empty. Then, they can go back to the door (step 8: gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_3), then go to room_3 (step 9: gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_2). This way, the state where they were in front of empty (step 7) is before entering room_3 (step 9). That would satisfy the constraint.

Once in room_3, the agent needs to get in front of blue_ball_1. So:

10. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_3
11. Now the goal is achieved.

But wait, the goal is "there is a ball v such that v is blue and you are in front of v". So blue_ball_1 is in room_3. So after step 10, the agent is in front of it. But let's check the preconditions for "gotoobject". The agent must be in the same room as the object. So after step 9, the agent is in room_3. Then, step 10 is valid.

But let's check if all constraints are satisfied.

First, the agent must never be in room_1. All steps avoid room_1.

Second, purple_door_1 remains locked. Since the agent never interacts with purple_door_1, and the initial state has it locked, it remains so.

Third, the agent is in room_3 in step 9, which satisfies the "must be in room_3 at least once" constraint.

Fourth, the constraint that if in room_3, there was an earlier state where the agent was in front of yellow_ball_2 or empty. In our steps, before entering room_3 (step 9), the agent was in front of empty in step 7. So that's satisfied.

Now, let's verify the steps in order:

1. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4 (agent is in room_2, door connects room_2 and 4, no blocking object)
2. toggle green_door_1 (unlocks it)
3. gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1 (moves to room_4)
4. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_3 (agent in room_4, door connects to room_3, no blocking object)
5. toggle yellow_door_2 (unlocks it)
6. gotoempty (agent in room_4, moves to empty spot)
7. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_3 (now in front of door again)
8. gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_2 (moves to room_3)
9. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_3 (now in front of blue_ball_1)

But wait, step 6 is gotoempty, then step 7 is gotodoor again. That's allowed. So the sequence would be:

Action list:

1. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4
2. toggle green_door_1
3. gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1
4. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_3
5. toggle yellow_door_2
6. gotoempty
7. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_3
8. gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_2
9. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_3

But wait, when the agent does step 6 (gotoempty), they are no longer in front of any door. Then step 7 is gotodoor again, which is allowed as long as they are in the same room (room_4) and the door is unblocked. Then they can proceed to go through the door.

This sequence should work. Let's check if there's a shorter path. For example, after step 5 (toggle yellow_door_2), can the agent immediately go to room_3 without the gotoempty step? But that would violate the constraint, because entering room_3 (step 6) would require that before that, the agent was in front of empty or yellow_ball_2. But in that case, before entering room_3, the agent was in front of the door (from step 4 and 5). So they need to insert the gotoempty step before entering room_3.

Alternatively, maybe after unlocking the door (step 5), the agent can gotoempty (step 6), then gotoroom directly. Wait, no. To use gotoroom, the agent needs to be in the room connected by the door. Wait, gotoroom's precondition is that you are in a room r0 adjacent to r via door d, and the door is unlocked. So after unlocking yellow_door_2 in step 5, the agent is in front of the door in room_4. Then, if they gotoempty (step6), they are in front of an empty spot in room_4. Then, to go to room_3, they need to go to the door again (step7: gotodoor) then gotoroom. Alternatively, can they go directly from being in front of empty to gotoroom? No, because gotoroom requires that you are in front of the door. Wait, no. The gotoroom action's preconditions don't require being in front of the door. Wait, looking back:

The "gotoroom r1 r2 d" action's preconditions are:

(i) you are in room r1 (adjacent to r2 via d)

(ii) the door d is unlocked.

So you don't need to be in front of the door to use gotoroom. You just need to be in r1 and the door is unlocked. So perhaps the steps can be adjusted.

Wait, the effects of gotoroom are that you are no longer in front of any object or door. So perhaps you can be anywhere in the room, not necessarily in front of the door. So maybe after unlocking the door, you don't need to go to the door again. Let me re-examine the action definitions.

The "gotoroom r1 r2 d" action's preconditions are:

- in r1, which is adjacent to r2 via d.

- d is unlocked.

So as long as you are in r1 and the door is unlocked, you can go to r2. You don't have to be in front of the door. So perhaps the steps can be optimized.

So revised plan:

After unlocking green_door_1 and moving to room_4 (steps 1-3):

4. In room_4, need to unlock yellow_door_2. To do that, go to the door (gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_3), toggle it, then gotoempty (to satisfy the constraint), then gotoroom to room_3.

But wait, the agent is in room_4. They can unlock yellow_door_2 by:

4. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_3

5. toggle yellow_door_2 (unlocks it)

6. gotoempty (now in front of empty in room_4)

7. gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_2 (since door is unlocked, and they are in room_4, which is connected via yellow_door_2 to room_3)

Then, in room_3:

8. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_3

This way, the constraint is satisfied because before entering room_3 (step7), the agent was in front of empty in step6.

This reduces the number of steps. So the plan would be:

1. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4

2. toggle green_door_1

3. gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1

4. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_3

5. toggle yellow_door_2

6. gotoempty

7. gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_2

8. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_3

That's 8 steps. Let's check if this works.

In step 6, after toggling the door (step5), the agent is in front of the door. Then they gotoempty (step6) in room_4. Then, gotoroom (step7) from room_4 to room_3 via yellow_door_2. Since the door is unlocked, this is allowed. Then, in room_3, they go to the blue ball.

This satisfies all constraints. The agent never enters room_1. Purple_door_1 remains locked. They visit room_3. Before entering room_3, they were in front of empty (step6). So this should work.

Is there a way to make it even shorter? For example, after unlocking yellow_door_2 (step5), if they can immediately gotoempty and then gotoobject in room_3. But to reach room_3, they need to perform gotoroom. So no, the steps are necessary.

Therefore, the optimal plan is the 8-step sequence above.
