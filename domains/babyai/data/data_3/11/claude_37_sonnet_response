Let me break down this planning problem:

Initial State:
- I am in room_2.
- Various objects (boxes and balls) are distributed across rooms:
  * In room_1: green_box_1, yellow_ball_1
  * In room_2: purple_box_1
  * In room_3: blue_ball_1, green_box_2, yellow_ball_2
  * In room_4: purple_box_2, blue_box_1
- All doors (yellow_door_1, purple_door_1, green_door_1, yellow_door_2) are locked.
- The doors connect the rooms as described (room_1-room_2, room_1-room_3, room_2-room_4, room_3-room_4).
- I have visited room_2.
- I am not holding any object.

Goal:
- Be in front of blue_ball_1.

Constraints:
- purple_door_1 must stay locked.
- I must never be in room_1.
- I must be in room_3 at some point.
- Before I can be in room_3, I must be in front of yellow_ball_2 or in front of an empty position.

Let me think about how to reach blue_ball_1:
- blue_ball_1 is in room_3.
- I cannot go directly to room_3 from room_1 (I can't be in room_1).
- I need to go from room_2 to room_4, and then from room_4 to room_3.

So the general plan would be:
1. Unlock and go through green_door_1 from room_2 to room_4.
2. Unlock and go through yellow_door_2 from room_4 to room_3.
3. Go to blue_ball_1 in room_3.

Let's consider the constraint that before I can be in room_3, I must be in front of yellow_ball_2 or an empty position. But yellow_ball_2 is in room_3, which I haven't reached yet. So I must be in front of an empty position at some point before reaching room_3.

Let's start detailing the plan:

1. First, since I'm in room_2, I'll go to green_door_1 which connects room_2 and room_4.
   - gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4

2. Then I'll unlock green_door_1.
   - toggle green_door_1

3. Before going to room_4, I need to ensure that I've been in front of an empty position:
   - gotoempty

4. Now I can proceed to room_4:
   - gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1

5. In room_4, I'll go to yellow_door_2 which connects room_4 and room_3:
   - gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_3

6. Unlock yellow_door_2:
   - toggle yellow_door_2

7. Go to room_3:
   - gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_2

8. In room_3, go to blue_ball_1:
   - gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_3

Wait, let me double-check if this satisfies all constraints:

- "purple_door_1 is locked": Yes, I never toggle purple_door_1.
- "you are not in room_1": Yes, I never enter room_1.
- "you are in room_3 at some point": Yes, I go to room_3 in step 7.
- "If you are in room_3, then before that you were in front of yellow_ball_2 or an empty position": I went in front of an empty position in step 3 before going to room_3 in step 7.

Actually, I should re-examine the last constraint.

"If expression "you are in room_3" holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: "At least one of the following conditions is true: "you are in front of yellow_ball_2", "you are in front of empty"""

This means that before I enter room_3, I must have been in front of yellow_ball_2 or an empty position. But since yellow_ball_2 is in room_3, which I haven't been to yet, I must have been in front of an empty position. Step 3 of my plan (gotoempty) addresses this.

Hmm, wait. Let me double-check if there are any other ways to reach room_3. I can go from room_1 to room_3 via purple_door_1, but I'm not allowed to enter room_1. So, the only way to reach room_3 is through room_4, which is what I've planned.

Let's review the actions and preconditions to ensure my plan is valid:

1. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4:
   - Precondition: I'm in room_2 (satisfied in the initial state) and there's no object blocking green_door_1 (assumed to be satisfied).
   - Effect: I'm in front of green_door_1.

2. toggle green_door_1:
   - Precondition: I'm in front of green_door_1 (satisfied after step 1).
   - Effect: green_door_1 is unlocked.

3. gotoempty:
   - Precondition: None specific.
   - Effect: I'm in front of an empty position.

4. gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1:
   - Precondition: I'm in room_2 (satisfied) and green_door_1 is unlocked (satisfied after step 2).
   - Effect: I'm in room_4.

5. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_3:
   - Precondition: I'm in room_4 (satisfied after step 4) and there's no object blocking yellow_door_2 (assumed to be satisfied).
   - Effect: I'm in front of yellow_door_2.

6. toggle yellow_door_2:
   - Precondition: I'm in front of yellow_door_2 (satisfied after step 5).
   - Effect: yellow_door_2 is unlocked.

7. gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_2:
   - Precondition: I'm in room_4 (satisfied) and yellow_door_2 is unlocked (satisfied after step 6).
   - Effect: I'm in room_3.

8. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_3:
   - Precondition: I'm in room_3 (satisfied after step 7) and blue_ball_1 is in room_3 (satisfied in the initial state).
   - Effect: I'm in front of blue_ball_1.

The plan seems valid, let me double-check for optimality. The goal is to be in front of blue_ball_1. Blue_ball_1 is in room_3, and I need to navigate from room_2 to room_3. The most direct route would be through room_4, which is what I've planned. So, the plan seems optimal in terms of the number of actions.

Actually, there's one more consideration: the constraint about being in front of yellow_ball_2 or an empty position before being in room_3. I've planned to go in front of an empty position in room_2 before entering room_3. However, I could also go in front of yellow_ball_2 after entering room_3 (since yellow_ball_2 is in room_3). But that would mean I'd be in room_3 before satisfying the constraint, which isn't allowed. So, the current plan remains valid and optimal.

OK, however there's an issue with the constraint:

"If expression 
   "you are in room_3"
   holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: 
   "At least one of the following conditions is true: "you are in front of yellow_ball_2", "you are in front of empty"""

This requires that BEFORE I ever go to room_3, I must have been in front of yellow_ball_2 or an empty position. Since yellow_ball_2 is in room_3, which I haven't been to yet, the only option is to be in front of an empty position before entering room_3. This is accommodated in my plan.

I think I misunderstood the constraint initially. Let me make sure my plan is aligned with this constraint:

1. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4: I'm in front of green_door_1, not in front of empty.
2. toggle green_door_1: I'm in front of green_door_1, not in front of empty.
3. gotoempty: I'm in front of an empty position. This is what I need to satisfy the constraint.
4. gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1: I'm no longer in front of anything, but I've previously been in front of an empty position.
5. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_3: I'm in front of yellow_door_2.
6. toggle yellow_door_2: I'm in front of yellow_door_2.
7. gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_2: I'm in room_3, and before this, I've been in front of an empty position (in step 3), satisfying the constraint.
8. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_3: I'm in front of blue_ball_1, which is the goal.

The plan seems valid, so let's finalize:

```
gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4
toggle green_door_1
gotoempty
gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1
gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_3
toggle yellow_door_2
gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_2
gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_3
```

So the final plan is:

```
gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4
toggle green_door_1
gotoempty
gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1
gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_3
toggle yellow_door_2
gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_2
gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_3
```

Hmm, let me re-examine the preconditions and effects for each action to ensure I understand them correctly:

I believe the action "gotoempty" means I go in front of an empty position in the current room, which could be thought of as a position that doesn't contain any object.

For the action "gotodoor", I go in front of a door in the current room, as long as (i) the door is connecting the current room with another and (ii) there's no object blocking the position in front of the door.

Okay, the plan should be valid. Let's check for efficiency:

We have 8 actions in our plan. Is there a shorter way to achieve our goal?

The goal is to be in front of blue_ball_1, which is in room_3. We start in room_2.

To reach room_3 from room_2, we need to go through room_4 (since we can't go to room_1). This requires:
1. Unlock green_door_1 (connecting room_2 and room_4)
2. Go to room_4
3. Unlock yellow_door_2 (connecting room_4 and room_3)
4. Go to room_3
5. Go to blue_ball_1

Additionally, due to the constraint, before we're in room_3, we must have been in front of an empty position. This adds the "gotoempty" action.

Given these requirements, the minimum number of actions seems to be 8, which is what our plan already has.

So our final plan, which is both valid and efficient, is:

```
gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4
toggle green_door_1
gotoempty
gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1
gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_3
toggle yellow_door_2
gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_2
gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_3
```

Actually, wait. I think I made a mistake. I need to be more careful with the "gotodoor" action. I'm using it as "gotodoor door room_from room_to", but I need to check the exact format.

The description says:
"gotodoor d r1 r2": Go in front of door d, connecting room r1 to room r2.

So the format is "gotodoor door r1 r2" where r1 and r2 are the rooms that the door connects. It's not clear which room I should be in, but given that the action's precondition is "you may only go in front of a door d if (i) you are in a room which door d is connecting with another room", I believe r1 can be the room I'm in, and r2 is the other room. But I need to make sure.

Let's reconsider.

We know that green_door_1 connects room_2 and room_4. And we're initially in room_2. So the action would be: gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4.

Similarly, for yellow_door_2, which connects room_4 and room_3, the action would be: gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_3.

That's consistent with what I had earlier. Let's re-validate the plan:

```
gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4
toggle green_door_1
gotoempty
gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1
gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_3
toggle yellow_door_2
gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_2
gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_3
```

This seems valid. Let me check the preconditions for each action:

1. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4:
   - I'm in room_2 (satisfied in the initial state).
   - green_door_1 connects room_2 and room_4 (satisfied).
   - No object is blocking the door (assumed, not mentioned).

2. toggle green_door_1:
   - I'm in front of green_door_1 (satisfied after step 1).

3. gotoempty:
   - I can go in front of an empty position anytime.

4. gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1:
   - I'm in room_2 (satisfied).
   - Room_2 and room_4 are adjacent and connected by green_door_1 (satisfied).
   - green_door_1 is unlocked (satisfied after step 2).

5. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_3:
   - I'm in room_4 (satisfied after step 4).
   - yellow_door_2 connects room_4 and room_3 (satisfied).
   - No object is blocking the door (assumed, not mentioned).

6. toggle yellow_door_2:
   - I'm in front of yellow_door_2 (satisfied after step 5).

7. gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_2:
   - I'm in room_4 (satisfied).
   - Room_4 and room_3 are adjacent and connected by yellow_door_2 (satisfied).
   - yellow_door_2 is unlocked (satisfied after step 6).

8. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_3:
   - I'm in room_3 (satisfied after step 7).
   - blue_ball_1 is in room_3 (satisfied in the initial state).

The plan is valid, but let's see if there's anything unnecessary.

Wait, there's a potential issue. I just realized I might have misunderstood the "gotoempty" action. Let me check:

"gotoempty": Go in front of an empty position of the room, which does not contain any object.

Basically, I'm going to a part of the room where there are no objects. However, after I've used "gotodoor" to go to the door, I'm already in front of the door, which isn't an empty position. So, the "gotoempty" step is an independent step where I choose to move away from the door to an empty spot in the room.

So, to reconfirm, the action sequence:
1. I go to the door (gotodoor).
2. I toggle the door (toggle).
3. I move to an empty position in the room (gotoempty). This is not necessary for the door actions but is required by the constraint that before I'm in room_3, I must have been in front of an empty position or yellow_ball_2.
4. I go to the other room (gotoroom).

Given that, the plan is still valid.

But there's one more thing to consider:

Does the constraint "If you are in room_3, then before that you were in front of yellow_ball_2 or an empty position" require me to be in front of an empty position immediately before I go to room_3, or at any point before going to room_3?

I think it means at any point before going to room_3. In that case, the plan is valid. But if the constraint requires the "gotoempty" action to be the last action before going to room_3, then our plan would need to be adjusted.

To be safe, let's rearrange the actions so that "gotoempty" is the last action before entering room_3:

```
gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4
toggle green_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1
gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_3
toggle yellow_door_2
gotoempty
gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_2
gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_3
```

Let's validate this revised plan:

1. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4:
   - I'm in room_2 (satisfied in the initial state).
   - green_door_1 connects room_2 and room_4 (satisfied).
   - No object is blocking the door (assumed).

2. toggle green_door_1:
   - I'm in front of green_door_1 (satisfied after step 1).

3. gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1:
   - I'm in room_2 (satisfied).
   - Room_2 and room_4 are adjacent and connected by green_door_1 (satisfied).
   - green_door_1 is unlocked (satisfied after step 2).

4. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_3:
   - I'm in room_4 (satisfied after step 3).
   - yellow_door_2 connects room_4 and room_3 (satisfied).
   - No object is blocking the door (assumed).

5. toggle yellow_door_2:
   - I'm in front of yellow_door_2 (satisfied after step 4).

6. gotoempty:
   - I can go in front of an empty position anytime.

7. gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_2:
   - I'm in room_4 (satisfied).
   - Room_4 and room_3 are adjacent and connected by yellow_door_2 (satisfied).
   - yellow_door_2 is unlocked (satisfied after step 5).

8. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_3:
   - I'm in room_3 (satisfied after step 7).
   - blue_ball_1 is in room_3 (satisfied in the initial state).

This plan is also valid. Let's review the constraints:
- purple_door_1 is locked: Satisfied, I never toggle purple_door_1.
- I am not in room_1: Satisfied, I never go to room_1.
- I am in room_3 at some point: Satisfied, I go to room_3 in step 7.
- If I am in room_3, then before that I was in front of yellow_ball_2 or an empty position: Satisfied, I go in front of an empty position in step 6 before entering room_3 in step 7.

However, the constraint "If you are in room_3, then before that you were in front of yellow_ball_2 or an empty position" seems to be vague about the timing. It could mean "at any time before you're in room_3, you must have been in front of yellow_ball_2 or an empty position", or it could mean "immediately before you're in room_3, you must be in front of yellow_ball_2 or an empty position".

Actually, the constraints are written in a specific modal logic syntax: "If expression 'X' holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which 'Y' is true." This to me clearly means that at any point before I'm in room_3, I must have been in front of yellow_ball_2 or an empty position. It doesn't have to be immediately before. Therefore, the original plan is valid.

Hmm, let me check one more thing. The preconditions for the "gotoroom" action says:
"goto room": you may only go in a room r if (i) you are currently in a room r0 that is adjacent to r, and (ii) the door that is connecting r0 and r is unlocked.

It doesn't explicitly say I need to be in front of the door. However, the wording "may only go in a room r if..." suggests that these are the only constraints, and being in front of the door isn't one of them.

But the effects of the "goto door" action say:
"goto door": After performing this action regarding a door d, (i) if you were in front of some object or door x0, then you are no longer in front of x0 and (ii) you are in front of door d.

This suggests that the "goto door" action positions me in front of the door. And the purpose of the "goto room" action is to go from one room to another through that door.

Given that context, it seems like the "goto room" action would require me to be in front of the door. If that's the case, then the "gotoempty" action would move me away from the door, and I'd need to go back to the door before I can use "goto room".

Are there other preconditions that I'm missing that clarify this?

Oh, I didn't see any explicit precondition for "gotoroom" that requires me to be in front of the door. However, intuitively, it makes sense that I'd need to be in front of the door to go through it.

It's worth being careful here. The actions are: "gotoroom r1 r2 d", which means "Go to room r2 from room r1 using door d." The preconditions are: "(i) you are currently in a room r0 that is adjacent to r, and (ii) the door that is connecting r0 and r is unlocked."

It doesn't say I need to be in front of the door. The action is about transitioning from one room to another via a door. It doesn't say anything about WHERE in the room I need to be.

Actually, the effect of "gotoroom" action reveals something:
"goto room": After performing this action in order to go from room r1 to room r2, (i) you are no longer in r1, (ii) you are in r2, (iii) you have visited r2, (iv) if you were in front of some object or door x0, then you are no longer in front of x0.

Effect (iv) says that if I were in front of some object or door x0, then I'm no longer in front of it after the action. This doesn't require that I was in front of a door before the action, only that if I was, then I no longer am after the action.

So, it seems like the precondition for "gotoroom" is just that I'm in room r1, and the door connecting r1 and r2 is unlocked. It doesn't matter if I'm in front of the door or not.

If that's the case, then my original plan is valid:
```
gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4
toggle green_door_1
gotoempty
gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1
gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_3
toggle yellow_door_2
gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_2
gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_3
```

In this plan, after unlocking green_door_1, I move to an empty position in room_2. Then, I go to room_4, even though I'm not in front of green_door_1. If the precondition for "gotoroom" doesn't require me to be in front of the door, then this is valid.

Intuitively, this doesn't sound realistic, because generally you'd need to be near a door to go through it. But the preconditions don't explicitly state this. 

Let me check for any other cues from the given context.

The "toggle" action states that "toggle": you may only toggle a door d if you are in front of d. This supports the idea that the actions are sensitive to where I am.

But the fact remains that "gotoroom" doesn't have a precondition that says: "you may only go to another room if you are in front of the door that connects the current room to that room." So can I go to other rooms without explicitly going to a door first?

Given the ambiguity, I'll opt for a more conservative plan where I always ensure I'm in front of a door before going through it.

Plan:
```
gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4
toggle green_door_1
gotoempty
gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4
gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1
gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_3
toggle yellow_door_2
gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_2
gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_3
```

Wait, the more I think about this. If "gotoroom" has a precondition requiring one to be at the specific door, it would almost certainly be stated in the domain description. 

Actually, the domain description states the following for gotoroom:
"goto room": you may only go in a room r if (i) you are currently in a room r0 that is adjacent to r, and (ii) the door that is connecting r0 and r is unlocked.

This doesn't mention anything about being in front of the door. Therefore, I don't believe the precondition includes this. The goal of this exercise is to test my understanding and mastery of given specifications, not to rely on real-world intuition.

Let's go with the plan that strictly adheres to the given preconditions and effects:

```
gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4
toggle green_door_1
gotoempty
gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1
gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_3
toggle yellow_door_2
gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_2
gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_3
```

This seems to be the most valid and efficient plan. Let me validate it once more by checking the preconditions for each action:

1. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4:
   - I'm in room_2 (satisfied in the initial state).
   - green_door_1 connects room_2 and room_4 (satisfied).
   - No object is blocking the door (assumed).

2. toggle green_door_1:
   - I'm in front of green_door_1 (satisfied after step 1).

3. gotoempty:
   - I can go in front of an empty position anytime.

4. gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1:
   - I'm in room_2 (satisfied).
   - Room_2 and room_4 are adjacent and connected by green_door_1 (satisfied).
   - green_door_1 is unlocked (satisfied after step 2).

5. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_3:
   - I'm in room_4 (satisfied after step 4).
   - yellow_door_2 connects room_4 and room_3 (satisfied).
   - No object is blocking the door (assumed).

6. toggle yellow_door_2:
   - I'm in front of yellow_door_2 (satisfied after step 5).

7. gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_2:
   - I'm in room_4 (satisfied).
   - Room_4 and room_3 are adjacent and connected by yellow_door_2 (satisfied).
   - yellow_door_2 is unlocked (satisfied after step 6).

8. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_3:
   - I'm in room_3 (satisfied after step 7).
   - blue_ball_1 is in room_3 (satisfied in the initial state).

The constraints are also satisfied.

1. purple_door_1 is always locked: Satisfied, as I never toggle purple_door_1.
2. I am never in room_1: Satisfied, as I never go to room_1.
3. I am in room_3 at some point: Satisfied, as I go to room_3 in step 7.
4. If I am in room_3, then before that I was in front of yellow_ball_2 or an empty position: Satisfied, as I go in front of an empty position in step 3 before entering room_3 in step 7.

So, my final plan is:

```
gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4
toggle green_door_1
gotoempty
gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1
gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_3
toggle yellow_door_2
gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_2
gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_3
```

This plan is valid, satisfies all constraints, and seems to be the most efficient.

Actually, let's make sure for absolute certainty that the plan is still valid if I move away from the door after toggling it. When I execute "gotoempty", I move away from the door and go in front of an empty position. Then, when I execute "gotoroom", I might not necessarily be in front of the door.

Looking at the preconditions for "gotoroom", they indeed don't require me to be in front of the door. They only require that I'm in room r1 and the door connecting r1 and r2 is unlocked. Therefore, the plan should still be valid.

But let's do one more check:

The effect of the "goto empty" action is: 
"goto empty": After performing this action, (i) if you were in front of some object or door x0, then you are no longer in front of x0 and (ii) you are in front of an empty position.

This moves me away from the door, so after this action, I'm not in front of green_door_1 anymore. But the precondition for "gotoroom" doesn't require me to be in front of the door.

Given that the preconditions only define what is strictly required for an action to be valid, our plan should still be valid.

Let's double-check:

Are all the preconditions satisfied?
1. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4: (i) I am in room_2, (ii) green_door_1 connects room_2 to room_4. Both preconditions are satisfied.

2. toggle green_door_1: I am in front of green_door_1 after step 1, so the precondition is satisfied.

3. gotoempty: There's no specific precondition, so it's always satisfied.

4. gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1: (i) I am in room_2, (ii) green_door_1 connecting room_2 to room_4 is unlocked after step 2. So the preconditions are satisfied.

5. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_3: (i) I am in room_4 after step 4, (ii) yellow_door_2 connects room_4 to room_3. Both preconditions are satisfied.

6. toggle yellow_door_2: I am in front of yellow_door_2 after step 5, so the precondition is satisfied.

7. gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_2: (i) I am in room_4, (ii) yellow_door_2 connecting room_4 to room_3 is unlocked after step 6. So the preconditions are satisfied.

8. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_3: I am in room_3 after step 7 and blue_ball_1 is in room_3, so the precondition is satisfied.

All the preconditions are satisfied, so our plan is valid. And as we discussed earlier, the constraints are also satisfied. Given that we have the shortest possible path from room_2 to room_3 (via room_4), the plan is also optimal.

To restate, the final plan is:

```
gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4
toggle green_door_1
gotoempty
gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1
gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_3
toggle yellow_door_2
gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_2
gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_3
```
