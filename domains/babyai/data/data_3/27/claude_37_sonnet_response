Let me analyze the planning problem:

1. Initial state:
   - I am in room_1
   - Various objects are in different rooms (grey_ball_1, green_ball_1, blue_box_1, yellow_ball_1 in room_1; red_box_1, blue_box_2 in room_2; blue_box_3 in room_3; red_ball_1 in room_4)
   - All doors (grey_door_1, green_door_1, blue_door_1, yellow_door_1) are locked
   - I'm not holding any object
   - I have only visited room_1

2. Goal:
   - Be in front of blue_door_1 (which connects room_2 and room_4)
   - blue_door_1 should be unlocked
   - I need to be in room_2 or room_4 to be in front of blue_door_1

3. Constraints:
   - At some point, blue_box_2 must be in room_1
   - At some point, I must be in front of blue_box_2
   - grey_door_1 must remain locked throughout the plan

Let's think about this step by step:

1. I start in room_1
2. To move blue_box_2 to room_1, I need to first reach room_2 (where blue_box_2 is)
3. To reach room_2, I need to go through grey_door_1, but it's locked and must remain locked
4. I need to find another path to room_2

Looking at the room layout:
- room_1 (NW) connects to room_2 (SW) via grey_door_1
- room_1 (NW) connects to room_3 (NE) via green_door_1
- room_2 (SW) connects to room_4 (SE) via blue_door_1
- room_3 (NE) connects to room_4 (SE) via yellow_door_1

The only path from room_1 to room_2 without using grey_door_1 would be:
room_1 -> room_3 -> room_4 -> room_2

So my plan should be:
1. Unlock green_door_1 to go from room_1 to room_3
2. Unlock yellow_door_1 to go from room_3 to room_4
3. Unlock blue_door_1 to go from room_4 to room_2
4. Pick up blue_box_2 in room_2
5. Go back to room_1 via the same path in reverse
6. Drop blue_box_2 in room_1
7. Go back to room_2
8. Stand in front of blue_door_1
9. Ensure blue_door_1 is unlocked

Let me now formalize this into actions:

1. First, I need to unlock green_door_1 to get out of room_1
   - gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3
   - toggle green_door_1
   - gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1

2. Now I'm in room_3, I need to unlock yellow_door_1 to get to room_4
   - gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_4
   - toggle yellow_door_1
   - gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_1

3. Now I'm in room_4, I need to unlock blue_door_1 to get to room_2
   - gotodoor blue_door_1 room_4 room_2
   - toggle blue_door_1
   - gotoroom room_4 room_2 blue_door_1

4. Now I'm in room_2, I need to pick up blue_box_2
   - gotoobject blue_box_2 room_2
   - pick blue_box_2 room_2

5. Go back to room_1 via room_4 and room_3
   - gotoroom room_2 room_4 blue_door_1
   - gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_1
   - gotoroom room_3 room_1 green_door_1

6. Drop blue_box_2 in room_1
   - gotoempty
   - drop blue_box_2 room_1

7. Go back to room_2
   - gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1
   - gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_1
   - gotoroom room_4 room_2 blue_door_1

8. Stand in front of blue_door_1
   - gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_4

I think this plan meets all the constraints:
- At one point blue_box_2 is in room_1 (when I drop it there)
- At one point I am in front of blue_box_2 (when I go to pick it up in room_2)
- grey_door_1 remains locked throughout (I never toggle it)
- At the end, I am in front of blue_door_1, which is unlocked

Let me check this plan once more:

The final state should be:
- I am in room_2
- I am in front of blue_door_1
- blue_door_1 is unlocked
- blue_box_2 is in room_1
- grey_door_1 is still locked

But looking at the plan again, there's a subtlety: when I drop blue_box_2 in room_1, I need to make sure I goto an empty position first. After double-checking the preconditions for "drop", I see I can only drop an object if the position in front of me is empty.

Actually, I think there's a misunderstanding in my plan. Let me reclarify the preconditions and effects:

For "drop":
- I can only drop an object if I'm holding it and the position in front of me is empty
- After dropping, I'm in front of the object I just dropped

So the "gotoempty" before dropping is unnecessary and possibly incorrect. Let me revise:

When I'm in room_1 holding blue_box_2:
- gotoempty (to find an empty spot to drop the box)
- drop blue_box_2 room_1

This ensures I drop blue_box_2 at an empty position, and afterward I'll be in front of it.

Let me finalize the correct plan:

1. gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3
2. toggle green_door_1
3. gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1
4. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_4
5. toggle yellow_door_1
6. gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_1
7. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_4 room_2
8. toggle blue_door_1
9. gotoroom room_4 room_2 blue_door_1
10. gotoobject blue_box_2 room_2
11. pick blue_box_2 room_2
12. gotoroom room_2 room_4 blue_door_1
13. gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_1
14. gotoroom room_3 room_1 green_door_1
15. gotoempty
16. drop blue_box_2 room_1
17. gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1
18. gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_1
19. gotoroom room_4 room_2 blue_door_1
20. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_4

This should satisfy all the constraints and reach the goal state.

However, I want to double check my plan:
- Start in room_1
- Move to room_3 through green_door_1
- Move to room_4 through yellow_door_1
- Move to room_2 through blue_door_1
- Pick up blue_box_2 in room_2
- Return to room_1 through the same path
- Drop blue_box_2 in room_1
- Go back to room_2
- Stand in front of blue_door_1

I think this plan has minimal length as we need to:
1. Reach room_2 where blue_box_2 is
2. Bring blue_box_2 to room_1 (constraint)
3. Return to room_2 to stand in front of blue_door_1 (goal)

And the only path between room_1 and room_2 without using grey_door_1 (which must remain locked) is through room_3 and room_4.

So my final plan is:

1. gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3
2. toggle green_door_1
3. gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1
4. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_4
5. toggle yellow_door_1
6. gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_1
7. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_4 room_2
8. toggle blue_door_1
9. gotoroom room_4 room_2 blue_door_1
10. gotoobject blue_box_2 room_2
11. pick blue_box_2 room_2
12. gotoroom room_2 room_4 blue_door_1
13. gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_1
14. gotoroom room_3 room_1 green_door_1
15. gotoempty
16. drop blue_box_2 room_1
17. gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1
18. gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_1
19. gotoroom room_4 room_2 blue_door_1
20. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_4

Let me check this one more time against the goal: "There is a door d such that "The following conditions are all true: "d is blue", "room_4 and room_2 are connected via d", "you are in front of d", "d is not locked"""

After executing my plan:
- I am in room_2
- I am in front of blue_door_1
- blue_door_1 is blue
- room_4 and room_2 are connected via blue_door_1
- blue_door_1 is not locked (I unlocked it in step 8)

And the constraints:
- blue_box_2 was in room_1 at some point (after step 16)
- I was in front of blue_box_2 at some point (at step 10)
- grey_door_1 remained locked throughout (I never toggled it)

So this plan should satisfy the goal and all constraints.

Actually, let me double-check that I am in fact in room_2 at the end of the plan, as this is required to be in front of blue_door_1 from the room_2 side:

1. gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3
2. toggle green_door_1
3. gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1 (now in room_3)
4. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_4
5. toggle yellow_door_1
6. gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_1 (now in room_4)
7. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_4 room_2
8. toggle blue_door_1
9. gotoroom room_4 room_2 blue_door_1 (now in room_2)
10. gotoobject blue_box_2 room_2
11. pick blue_box_2 room_2
12. gotoroom room_2 room_4 blue_door_1 (now in room_4)
13. gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_1 (now in room_3)
14. gotoroom room_3 room_1 green_door_1 (now in room_1)
15. gotoempty
16. drop blue_box_2 room_1
17. gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1 (now in room_3)
18. gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_1 (now in room_4)
19. gotoroom room_4 room_2 blue_door_1 (now in room_2)
20. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_4

Yes, I end up in room_2 after step 19, and then in step 20 I go in front of blue_door_1 from the room_2 side. This looks correct.

Let me specify the plan one more time:

```
gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3
toggle green_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_4
toggle yellow_door_1
gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_1
gotodoor blue_door_1 room_4 room_2
toggle blue_door_1
gotoroom room_4 room_2 blue_door_1
gotoobject blue_box_2 room_2
pick blue_box_2 room_2
gotoroom room_2 room_4 blue_door_1
gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_1
gotoroom room_3 room_1 green_door_1
gotoempty
drop blue_box_2 room_1
gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1
gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_1
gotoroom room_4 room_2 blue_door_1
gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_4
```

This plan should solve the given planning problem.
