Okay, let's see. The goal is to have a blue door connecting room_4 and room_2, which is blue, and I need to be in front of it with it unlocked. Also, there are constraints. So first, I need to figure out which door that is. Looking at the doors, blue_door_1 is blue and connects room_2 and room_4. So that's the door we need. But it's currently locked. So I need to unlock it. But to toggle it, I have to be in front of it. But to get there, maybe I need to go through rooms. But all doors are locked initially. Wait, all doors are locked, so how do I move between rooms?

Wait, the initial state says all doors are locked. So I can't go through any doors unless I unlock them. But to unlock a door, I need to toggle it, which requires being in front of it. But to get in front of a door, I need to be in a room connected by that door. For example, to get to blue_door_1 from room_2, but I start in room_1. So how can I get to room_2? The door between room_1 and room_2 is grey_door_1, which is locked. So I need to unlock that first. But grey_door_1 is in room_1 and room_2. Wait, the constraint says that in every state, grey_door_1 must be locked. So I can't unlock it. Oh, that's a problem. Because if grey_door_1 has to stay locked, then I can't go from room_1 to room_2 through grey_door_1. So that's a dead end.

Wait, maybe there's another path. Let's see the connections. Room_1 is connected to room_3 via green_door_1, which is locked. Room_3 is connected to room_4 via yellow_door_1, which is locked. Room_2 is connected to room_4 via blue_door_1, which is locked. So the only way to get to blue_door_1 is to be in room_2 or room_4. But starting in room_1, with all doors locked and can't unlock grey_door_1 because of the constraint. So perhaps I can go through green_door_1 to room_3, but green_door_1 is locked. To unlock it, I need to toggle it, but to do that, I need to be in front of it. So in room_1, if I go to green_door_1, then toggle it. But then that would unlock it, allowing me to go to room_3. Let's check the constraints: the only constraint on doors is that grey_door_1 must remain locked in every state. So unlocking green_door_1 is allowed. So the plan could be: unlock green_door_1, go to room_3, then unlock yellow_door_1 to get to room_4. Then from room_4, go to blue_door_1 (since room_4 is connected to room_2 via blue_door_1). But blue_door_1 is locked. So need to toggle it. But to do that, I need to be in front of it. So if I'm in room_2 or room_4. Wait, but how do I get to room_2? Because grey_door_1 is locked and can't be unlocked. So maybe from room_4, via blue_door_1. If I can get to room_4, then go to blue_door_1 in room_4, toggle it, then be in front of it and have it unlocked.

Wait, but how to reach room_4. Let's outline possible steps:

1. In room_1. Need to unlock green_door_1 (connecting to room_3). So first, go to green_door_1 in room_1. But is there an object blocking it? The initial state in room_1 has grey_ball_1, green_ball_1, blue_box_1, yellow_ball_1. Are any of these blocking the door? The problem description says that "goto door" requires that there's no object blocking the position in front of d in the current room. The original state doesn't mention any objects blocking doors, so assuming they are not blocked. So, "gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3" would be possible. Then toggle it to unlock. Then go to room_3. From room_3, need to go to room_4 via yellow_door_1. But yellow_door_1 is locked. So need to go to yellow_door_1 in room_3, toggle it, then go to room_4. Once in room_4, then go to blue_door_1 (which connects room_4 to room_2), but blue_door_1 is locked. So need to toggle it. But to do that, I need to be in front of blue_door_1. So from room_4, go to blue_door_1, toggle it. Then the door is unlocked. Then I can be in front of blue_door_1 (since that's where I am after toggling). So that would satisfy the goal: d is blue (blue_door_1), connects room_4 and room_2, I'm in front of it, and it's unlocked.

But also, the constraints require that blue_box_2 is in room_1 in at least one state, and that I am in front of blue_box_2 in at least one state. Blue_box_2 is initially in room_2. So to get it to room_1, I need to pick it up and carry it. But since I can't get to room_2 through grey_door_1 (since it's locked and must stay locked), maybe there's another way. Wait, after unlocking blue_door_1, which connects room_4 and room_2. So if I go to room_4 via room_3 and room_4, then from room_4, go through blue_door_1 to room_2. But blue_door_1 was just unlocked. Then, once in room_2, I can pick up blue_box_2 and carry it back. But how? Let's see:

After unlocking blue_door_1, I can go from room_4 to room_2. Then, in room_2, pick up blue_box_2, then take it back through blue_door_1 to room_4, then to room_3 via yellow_door_1, then to room_1 via green_door_1, and drop it there. But that's a long process. But the constraints require that blue_box_2 is in room_1 at some point. So that's necessary.

But let's think step by step.

First, unlock green_door_1:

Current room: room_1.

Action: gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3.

Then toggle green_door_1 to unlock.

Then gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1.

Now in room_3. Then, need to unlock yellow_door_1 to get to room_4.

In room_3, gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_4.

Toggle yellow_door_1 to unlock.

Then gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_1.

Now in room_4. Then, go to blue_door_1 in room_4 (since blue_door_1 connects room_2 and room_4).

But blue_door_1 is locked. So need to toggle it.

Action: gotodoor blue_door_1 room_4 room_2.

Toggle blue_door_1 to unlock.

Now, blue_door_1 is unlocked. Now, being in front of blue_door_1 in room_4, the goal is achieved? Because the goal requires being in front of d (blue_door_1), which is blue, connects room_4 and room_2, and is unlocked. But wait, the current state after toggling is that blue_door_1 is unlocked. So after the toggle, the door is unlocked, and we are in front of it. So that's the goal state. But the problem is that the goal requires that there exists a door d with those conditions, and the agent is in front of it. So perhaps after the toggle action, the agent is in front of blue_door_1, and the door is unlocked. So that would satisfy the goal. But we need to check if the constraints are met.

Wait, the constraints are:

1. blue_box_2 is in room_1 at least once.

2. agent is in front of blue_box_2 at least once.

3. grey_door_1 is locked in every state.

So even if the main goal is achieved, we need to make sure that during the plan, these constraints are met.

So during the plan, we need to have blue_box_2 in room_1 and the agent in front of it. So perhaps after unlocking blue_door_1 and being in room_4, the agent can go through blue_door_1 to room_2, pick up blue_box_2, carry it back through blue_door_1 to room_4, then to room_3, then to room_1, and drop it there. Then proceed to unlock blue_door_1 again. But that's a longer plan. But the plan needs to be optimal (shortest possible). So maybe there's a way to do both in the same steps.

Wait, let's see. The initial steps are:

1. Go to green_door_1 in room_1.

2. Toggle green_door_1 (unlock).

3. Go to room_3.

4. Go to yellow_door_1 in room_3.

5. Toggle yellow_door_1 (unlock).

6. Go to room_4.

7. Go to blue_door_1 in room_4.

8. Toggle blue_door_1 (unlock). Now, in front of blue_door_1, which is unlocked. So the goal is achieved. But the constraints are not yet met.

So in this plan, the constraints are not satisfied. So need to incorporate moving blue_box_2 to room_1 and being in front of it.

So perhaps after step 8, the agent can go to room_2 via blue_door_1 (since it's now unlocked). Then pick up blue_box_2 (which is in room_2), then carry it back through blue_door_1 to room_4, then to room_3 via yellow_door_1, then to room_1 via green_door_1, then drop it in room_1. Then go back to blue_door_1 and unlock it again. But that's a lot of steps. But maybe there's a smarter way.

Alternatively, after step 6 (in room_4), before toggling blue_door_1, go to room_2 via blue_door_1 (but blue_door_1 is locked, so can't. So need to toggle it first. So steps 7 and 8: toggle blue_door_1 to unlock. Then go to room_2. Then pick up blue_box_2. Then return to room_4, then go to room_3, room_1, drop it. Then go back to blue_door_1 and be in front of it. But that's a lot of steps, but the problem requires an optimal plan, which is the shortest possible. So maybe there's a way to do this more efficiently.

Alternatively, maybe during the movement from room_1 to room_3 to room_4, the agent can carry an object that's in room_1 (like blue_box_1), but the constraints require blue_box_2. So that's not helpful.

Wait, the constraints are:

- blue_box_2 must be in room_1 at some point.

- the agent must be in front of blue_box_2 at some point.

So to satisfy these, the agent must move blue_box_2 from room_2 to room_1, which requires entering room_2. But how? Because grey_door_1 is locked and must stay locked, the only way into room_2 is through blue_door_1 from room_4. So once blue_door_1 is unlocked, the agent can go to room_2, pick up blue_box_2, bring it to room_4, then to room_3, then to room_1, drop it. Then, go back to blue_door_1, unlock it (if needed) and be in front of it.

But let's outline this path:

1. Unlock green_door_1 (room_1 to room_3).

2. Go to room_3.

3. Unlock yellow_door_1 (room_3 to room_4).

4. Go to room_4.

5. Unlock blue_door_1 (room_4 to room_2).

6. Go to room_2.

7. Pick up blue_box_2.

8. Return to room_4.

9. Go to room_3.

10. Go to room_1.

11. Drop blue_box_2 in room_1.

12. Go back to room_4 through room_3 and room_4.

13. Go to blue_door_1 in room_4.

14. Toggle it again if needed (but after step 5, it's unlocked, so maybe not needed. Wait, step 5 was to toggle it, which would unlock it. Then, after step 5, it's unlocked. Then when you go to room_2, and then come back, the door remains unlocked unless you toggle it again. So the door is already unlocked. So after dropping blue_box_2 in room_1, the agent needs to go back to room_4, go to blue_door_1, and ensure that the door is unlocked. But since we toggled it once (unlocked), unless someone toggled it again, it remains unlocked. So if the plan doesn't toggle it again, then it's still unlocked. So after step 5, blue_door_1 is unlocked. Then steps 6-11: move blue_box_2 to room_1. Then, go back to room_4, step 13: goto door blue_door_1. Then the agent is in front of it, and it's unlocked. So the goal is achieved. So the plan would include those steps.

But how to structure the actions.

Let's try to outline the plan step by step:

Initial state: in room_1, not holding anything, all doors locked.

1. gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3 (preconditions: in a room connected by green_door_1 (room_1) and no object blocking. Assuming possible).

2. toggle green_door_1 (unlocks it).

3. gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1 (now in room_3).

4. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_4.

5. toggle yellow_door_1 (unlocks it).

6. gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_1 (now in room_4).

7. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_4 room_2.

8. toggle blue_door_1 (unlocks it).

9. gotoroom room_4 room_2 blue_door_1 (now in room_2).

10. gotoobject blue_box_2 room_2.

11. pick blue_box_2 room_2.

12. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_4.

13. gotoroom room_2 room_4 blue_door_1 (now in room_4).

14. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_3.

15. gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_1 (now in room_3).

16. gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_1.

17. gotoroom room_3 room_1 green_door_1 (now in room_1).

18. drop blue_box_2 room_1 (this satisfies the first constraint: blue_box_2 is in room_1).

But when dropping, the agent must be in front of an empty position. Wait, the drop action requires that the position in front is empty. So after step 17, the agent is in room_1. To drop blue_box_2, they need to go to an empty position (using gotoempty), then drop. So after step 17:

17. gotoroom room_3 room_1 green_door_1 (now in room_1, not in front of anything).

Wait, after gotoroom, the agent is no longer in front of any object or door. So to drop, they need to be in front of an empty position. So:

18. gotoempty (in room_1).

19. drop blue_box_2 room_1 (now blue_box_2 is in room_1, and agent is in front of it). But wait, when you drop, you are in front of the object. So after dropping, the agent is in front of blue_box_2, which satisfies the second constraint (being in front of blue_box_2 in at least one state).

Then, the agent needs to get back to blue_door_1 in room_4 to meet the goal. So after dropping, the steps would be:

20. gotoempty (maybe not needed).

But now, the agent is in room_1. To get back to blue_door_1 in room_4, they need to retrace the path:

20. gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3.

21. gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1 (room_3).

22. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_4.

23. gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_1 (room_4).

24. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_4 room_2.

At this point, the agent is in front of blue_door_1, which is unlocked (since step 8 toggled it). So the goal conditions are met here: in front of blue_door_1, which is blue, connects room_4 and room_2, and is unlocked. So the final action is step 24: gotodoor blue_door_1 room_4 room_2. Then, the plan would end here. Because after that action, the agent is in front of the door, which is unlocked.

But let's check if all constraints are met. The blue_box_2 is in room_1 after step 19. The agent was in front of blue_box_2 when they dropped it (step 19). And in all states, grey_door_1 remains locked (since we never toggled it). So all constraints are satisfied.

Now, count the steps:

1. gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3

2. toggle green_door_1

3. gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1

4. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_4

5. toggle yellow_door_1

6. gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_1

7. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_4 room_2

8. toggle blue_door_1

9. gotoroom room_4 room_2 blue_door_1

10. gotoobject blue_box_2 room_2

11. pick blue_box_2 room_2

12. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_4

13. gotoroom room_2 room_4 blue_door_1

14. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_3

15. gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_1

16. gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_1

17. gotoroom room_3 room_1 green_door_1

18. gotoempty

19. drop blue_box_2 room_1

20. gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3

21. gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1

22. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_4

23. gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_1

24. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_4 room_2

That's 24 steps. But is there a shorter way?

Wait, maybe after step 19, the agent is in front of blue_box_2. Then, instead of going all the way back, can they proceed directly? Let's see:

After step 19: in room_1, in front of blue_box_2. Now need to get back to blue_door_1 in room_4. So the steps would be:

20. gotoempty (if needed to move away from blue_box_2)

21. gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3

22. gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1

23. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_4

24. gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_1

25. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_4 room_2

So that's steps 20-25, but perhaps step 20 is not needed if after dropping, the agent is already in front of blue_box_2. The drop action puts the agent in front of the object. So after step 19, the agent is in front of blue_box_2. To go to the door, they need to leave that position. So step 20: gotoempty (in room_1).

Then steps 21-24. So total steps would be 24 actions. Is there a way to optimize this?

Alternatively, when returning to room_1, maybe the agent can drop the box immediately after entering room_1 without needing to gotoempty. Let's think:

After step 17, the agent is in room_1. When you enter a room via gotoroom, you are no longer in front of anything. So to drop the box, you need to be in front of an empty position. So the agent has to first gotoempty to drop. So steps 18 (gotoempty) and 19 (drop). So those steps are necessary.

So perhaps the plan is as outlined. But maybe there's a way to combine some steps. For example, after step 19, the agent is in front of blue_box_2. Then, to go to green_door_1, they can directly go to it without needing to gotoempty. Because when you perform gotodoor, you leave the current position. So perhaps:

After step 19 (drop), the agent is in front of blue_box_2. To go to green_door_1, they can do:

20. gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3 (precondition: in room_1, which they are. Also, the door's position is not blocked. So possible).

This would replace steps 18 (gotoempty) and 20 (gotoempty in previous plan). So this would save one step.

So revised steps after step 17:

17. gotoroom room_3 room_1 green_door_1 (in room_1)

18. gotoobject blue_box_2 room_1 (since blue_box_2 is now in room_1). But wait, after step 19, the agent just dropped it. So after step 19, the agent is in front of blue_box_2. So maybe step 19 is drop, then step 20 is gotodoor.

Wait, let me retrace:

After step 17: agent is in room_1.

18. gotoempty (to get to an empty position, allowing drop)

19. drop blue_box_2 room_1 (now in front of blue_box_2).

Then, step 20: gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3 (since in room_1, and green_door_1 is there, and no blocking objects). So this is possible. So steps 18 and 19 are necessary. Then step 20 is gotodoor.

So that's three steps. But maybe after dropping, the agent is already in front of blue_box_2, and can proceed to the door. So step 19: drop, then step 20: gotodoor.

So step 18: gotoempty may not be needed. Wait, when you drop, you are in front of the object. So to perform gotodoor, you need to be in the same room as the door, which is room_1. The preconditions for gotodoor are that you are in a room connected by the door (which room_1 is for green_door_1), and there's no object blocking the position in front of the door. Assuming blue_box_2 is not blocking green_door_1, then the agent can go to green_door_1 directly from being in front of blue_box_2. Because the goto door action would move them away from the object to the door. So step 19: drop blue_box_2, which puts them in front of it. Then step 20: gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3. This is allowed as long as they are in room_1 and the door's position is not blocked. So if the blue_box_2 is not blocking green_door_1, then this is possible.

So this way, steps 18 (gotoempty) can be skipped. So the revised plan would have:

After step 17:

17. gotoroom room_3 room_1 green_door_1 (in room_1, not in front of anything)

But to drop, they need to be in front of an empty position. Wait, no. The drop action's preconditions are:

- holding the object (yes, after pick)

- position in front is empty.

Wait, after step 17, the agent is in room_1, not holding anything (because step 17 is after gotoroom, which was after picking up blue_box_2 and moving back. Wait, let me correct:

Wait, step 11 is pick blue_box_2. So agent is holding it. Then steps 12-17: moving back to room_1. So in step 17, they are in room_1, still holding blue_box_2. Then, to drop it, they need to be in front of an empty position. So after step 17, they need to gotoempty to have an empty spot in front. Then drop.

So steps:

17. gotoroom room_3 room_1 green_door_1 (in room_1, holding blue_box_2)

18. gotoempty (in room_1)

19. drop blue_box_2 room_1 (now in front of it)

Then, step 20: gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3.

So that's three steps. So perhaps it's necessary. Therefore, the total steps remain 24. But maybe there's a way to optimize.

Alternative approach: when moving blue_box_2 to room_1, can the agent drop it earlier, for example, in room_3, but that would not satisfy the constraint. The constraint requires blue_box_2 to be in room_1. So must be dropped there.

Another idea: after picking up blue_box_2 in room_2, when returning to room_4, then to room_3, then to room_1, perhaps the agent can drop it in room_1 during that trip. Yes, but how.

Let's re-express the steps for transporting blue_box_2:

From room_2, after picking up blue_box_2 (step 11), the agent needs to go back to room_4 (step 13), then to room_3 (step 15), then to room_1 (step 17). Then, in room_1, gotoempty and drop. So steps 17-19 are required.

So perhaps there's no way to shorten this. Therefore, the plan is as outlined.

Now, check if all constraints are met:

- blue_box_2 is in room_1 after step 19.

- agent is in front of blue_box_2 during step 19 (after drop).

- grey_door_1 is locked in every state. Since we never interacted with grey_door_1, it remains locked.

So all constraints are satisfied.

The goal is achieved in step 24 (gotodoor blue_door_1 room_4 room_2), which is after unlocking and toggling it. So the final state has the agent in front of blue_door_1, which is blue, connects room_4 and room_2, and is unlocked.

Therefore, this plan should work.
