Okay, let's tackle this planning problem step by step. First, I need to understand the initial state, the goal, and the constraints.

The initial state has the agent in room_1. All doors are locked. The objects are spread across rooms: purple_ball_1 and purple_box_1 in room_1; yellow_ball_1 and green_ball_1 in room_2; purple_box_2, green_box_1, grey_ball_1, and purple_box_3 in room_3. The doors are red_door_1 (connects room_1 and room_2), red_door_2 (connects room_1 and room_3), yellow_door_1 (connects room_2 and room_4), and green_door_1 (connects room_3 and room_4). All doors are locked initially.

The goal is to have a red door (d) connecting room_1 and room_2 (which is red_door_1) that's unlocked, with the agent in front of it. So, the final state requires the agent to be in front of red_door_1, which is unlocked.

Constraints:
1. Must hold purple_ball_1 at least once.
2. red_door_1 must be unlocked at some point.
3. If red_door_1 is unlocked, there must have been a prior state where the agent was holding an object or was in front of red_door_2.
4. Must be in front of green_door_1 at some state.

So, the plan needs to include actions that meet these constraints while achieving the goal.

Starting in room_1. The goal is in room_1 or room_2 (since red_door_1 connects them). To unlock red_door_1, the agent needs to toggle it. But to toggle, they must be in front of it. However, to get in front of a door, they need to go to the door. But doors are initially locked, so the agent can't move through them. Wait, but the "gotodoor" action's preconditions don't require the door to be unlocked. The precondition for "gotodoor d r1 r2" is that the agent is in a room connected by d, and no object is blocking the position in front of d in the current room. So, if the agent is in room_1, they can goto red_door_1 (since it's in room_1 and room_2's door). But if the door is locked, but the "gotodoor" doesn't require the door to be unlocked. Wait, the "goto door" action's preconditions: (i) in a room connected by d, and (ii) no object blocks the position in front of d. So, the agent can go to the door even if it's locked. Then, once in front of the door, they can toggle it (unlock it). But since all doors are locked initially, the agent can approach any door in their current room and toggle it.

Wait, but the initial doors are locked. So, to unlock red_door_1, the agent can go to it, then toggle it. But how do they get to the door? Since the agent is in room_1, and red_door_1 connects room_1 and room_2. So, the agent can use "gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_2" while in room_1. Then, toggle it to unlock. Then, the door becomes unlocked, allowing movement between room_1 and room_2.

But the goal is to have red_door_1 unlocked and the agent in front of it. So, perhaps the steps would be: goto red_door_1, toggle it (unlock), which would satisfy the goal. But wait, the goal requires that d is red, connects room_1 and room_2, agent is in front of d, and d is not locked. So, after toggling red_door_1, it's unlocked, and if the agent is in front of it, that would meet the goal. So, the plan could be:

1. gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_2
2. toggle red_door_1

But wait, but the initial state has red_door_1 locked. So, after toggling, it becomes unlocked. Then, the agent is in front of red_door_1 (from step 1), and after toggling, the door is unlocked. But the problem is that after toggling, the agent is still in front of the door. So the final state would be agent in front of red_door_1, which is unlocked. So that would satisfy the goal.

But wait, the agent is in room_1. After performing "gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_2", they are in front of the door but still in room_1. Then, toggle. Then, the door is unlocked, and the agent is in front of it. So that's the goal. So, that's two actions. But there's constraints to consider.

Constraints:

1. Must hold purple_ball_1 at some state. So, the agent needs to pick up purple_ball_1 at some point.

2. red_door_1 must be not locked (which is achieved by step 2, so that's covered.

3. If red_door_1 is unlocked (which it is in step 2), there must be a prior state where the agent was holding an object or was in front of red_door_2. So, before step 2, the agent must have either held something or been in front of red_door_2.

4. Must be in front of green_door_1 at some state. So, the agent needs to go to green_door_1 in room_3 or room_4. But how? Since the agent starts in room_1, and doors are locked. Let's see.

So, let's outline the steps considering constraints.

First, the main goal can be achieved quickly with two actions, but the constraints require additional steps.

Let's think:

The agent needs to pick up purple_ball_1 (constraint 1). Purple_ball_1 is in room_1. So, the agent can do:

gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_1 â†’ pick purple_ball_1 room_1.

But then, they need to drop it somewhere. But maybe they can hold it for a while.

Also, the agent needs to be in front of green_door_1 (constraint 4). Green_door_1 connects room_3 and room_4. So, the agent must reach room_3 or room_4. But starting in room_1, all doors are locked. So, how to get to room_3? The red_door_2 connects room_1 and room_3. But it's locked. So, the agent can go to red_door_2 (in room_1), toggle it to unlock, then go through to room_3. Then, from room_3, go to green_door_1 (connecting to room_4), but green_door_1 is locked. So, the agent would need to unlock it as well.

But that's a lot of steps. But perhaps necessary to meet constraint 4.

Also, constraint 3 says that when red_door_1 is unlocked (in step 2), there must have been a prior state where the agent was holding an object or was in front of red_door_2.

So, the agent could first go to red_door_2, then unlock red_door_1. But how?

Alternatively, if the agent picks up purple_ball_1, then that satisfies the "holding some object" part of constraint 3. Then, after that, unlocking red_door_1 would satisfy the condition.

So, perhaps the plan is:

1. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_1
2. pick purple_ball_1 room_1 (now holding it, satisfies constraint 1)
3. drop purple_ball_1 room_1 (optional? Or maybe not needed)
4. gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_2
5. toggle red_door_1 (unlock it, satisfies constraint 2 and the goal)
But this would have steps 4 and 5 as the last two actions, meeting the goal. But then, the agent is in front of red_door_1, which is now unlocked. So the goal is achieved. But then, what about constraint 4 (being in front of green_door_1) and constraint 3 (prior state when unlocking red_door_1, the agent must have held something or been in front of red_door_2).

In the above plan, step 2 holds the purple ball, which meets the first part of constraint 3 (since before step 5 (unlocking red_door_1), the agent was holding the ball in step 2. So that's prior. Then constraint 3 is satisfied.

But then, constraint 4 requires being in front of green_door_1. How to achieve that?

So, the agent must somehow reach green_door_1. That would require moving from room_1 to room_3 (through red_door_2), then to room_4 (through green_door_1), but that requires unlocking doors.

Alternative plan:

- From room_1, go to red_door_2 (which connects to room_3). Since red_door_2 is locked, the agent can go to it (gotodoor), toggle to unlock. Then, go to room_3. Then, in room_3, go to green_door_1 (connects to room_4). Toggle to unlock, then go in front of green_door_1. That would satisfy constraint 4. Then, perhaps return to room_1 to proceed to unlock red_door_1.

But this adds a lot of steps. Let's outline this:

1. gotodoor red_door_2 room_1 room_3
2. toggle red_door_2 (unlock)
3. gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_2 (agent is now in room_3)
4. gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4
5. toggle green_door_1 (unlock)
6. Now, agent is in front of green_door_1 in room_3. This meets constraint 4.
Then, the agent needs to get back to room_1 to unlock red_door_1.

But how? To get back to room_1, they can use red_door_2 again. So:

7. gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_2
Now in room_1 again.
8. gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_2
9. toggle red_door_1 (unlocks it)
Now, agent is in front of red_door_1, which is unlocked. So the goal is met.

But also, during step 2, the agent was in front of red_door_2 (satisfying the alternative condition in constraint 3). Because when they toggle red_door_1 in step 9, the prior state (step 8) they are in front of red_door_1. Wait, but constraint 3 says that if red_door_1 is not locked (after step 9), there must be an earlier state where they were holding an object or in front of red_door_2.

In this plan, step 1 is gotodoor red_door_2, so after that, they were in front of red_door_2 (step 1). Then, after step 9, the unlocking of red_door_1 occurs. So, the prior state of step 9 (which is step 8: gotodoor red_door_1) doesn't involve being in front of red_door_2. But step 1 was prior to step 9, so the agent was in front of red_door_2 in step 1. So that would satisfy the constraint 3.

Also, constraint 1 requires holding purple_ball_1. So, in this current plan, the agent hasn't picked it up yet. So need to add steps to pick and hold it.

So, perhaps after returning to room_1 (step 7), they can pick up the purple_ball_1.

Let's adjust the plan:

After step 7 (back in room_1):

8. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_1
9. pick purple_ball_1 room_1 (now holding it, satisfies constraint 1)
10. drop purple_ball_1 room_1 (optional, but maybe needed to free hands for other actions)
But if we don't drop it, then when the agent goes to red_door_1, they can't pick anything else, but maybe it's okay.

Then:

11. gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_2
12. toggle red_door_1 (unlock)

Now, in step 12, red_door_1 is unlocked, and the agent is in front of it. This meets the goal. Also, the agent was holding purple_ball_1 in step 9, which is prior to step 12, satisfying constraint 3 (since the agent was holding an object before unlocking red_door_1). Also, constraint 4 is met in step 4 (after step 6, the agent is in front of green_door_1). But wait, step 4 is gotodoor green_door_1 in room_3. Then step 5 is toggle. So after step 4, the agent is in front of green_door_1. That satisfies constraint 4.

So the full plan would be:

1. gotodoor red_door_2 room_1 room_3
2. toggle red_door_2 (unlock)
3. gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_2
4. gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4
5. toggle green_door_1 (unlock)
6. (now in front of green_door_1, satisfying constraint 4)
7. gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_2 (back to room_1)
8. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_1
9. pick purple_ball_1 room_1 (constraint 1)
10. gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_2
11. toggle red_door_1 (unlock, meets goal and constraint 2)
12. (now in front of unlocked red_door_1, goal achieved)

But wait, after step 5, the agent is in front of green_door_1. So step 4 is "gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4" which puts them in front of it. That meets constraint 4. Then, step 5 toggles it (unlocks). Then, steps to return to room_1.

But the agent is in room_3 after step 3. Then steps 4-5 are in room_3. Then step 6 (if we go back to room_1) would be step 7: gotoroom room_3 room_1 via red_door_2. But red_door_2 is unlocked (from step 2). So that's possible.

But after step 7, the agent is in room_1 again. Then, they need to go to purple_ball_1, pick it up, then go to red_door_1, toggle it.

So this plan seems to satisfy all constraints and the goal.

But let's check all constraints:

Constraint 1: Holding purple_ball_1 at step 9. Yes.

Constraint 2: red_door_1 is unlocked in step 11. Yes.

Constraint 3: Before step 11 (unlocking red_door_1), the agent was holding an object (step 9) which is prior. So that's satisfied.

Constraint 4: In step 4, agent is in front of green_door_1. Yes.

But wait, step 4 is "gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4", which requires that the agent is in room_3. Since they are in room_3 after step 3, that's valid. So step 4 is allowed. Then, they are in front of green_door_1. That meets constraint 4.

So the plan seems to satisfy all constraints and the goal. Let's count the steps. It's 11 actions. But can it be optimized? For example, maybe combining some steps.

Wait, after step 5 (toggle green_door_1), the agent can proceed to go through green_door_1 to room_4. But that's not necessary. Alternatively, perhaps after step 5, the agent can go back to room_3, but in this plan, step 7 is going back to room_1. But maybe there's a shorter path.

Alternatively, after step 3 (in room_3), the agent can go to green_door_1 (step4), toggle (step5), then return to room_3, then go back to room_1 via red_door_2 (step6), pick up the ball (step7), goto red_door_1 (step8), toggle (step9). That's 9 steps.

Wait, but let's recount the steps in the previous plan:

1. gotodoor red_door_2 room_1 room_3
2. toggle red_door_2
3. gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_2
4. gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4
5. toggle green_door_1
6. gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_2
7. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_1
8. pick purple_ball_1 room_1
9. gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_2
10. toggle red_door_1

That's 10 steps. Let me check again.

Wait, step 6 would be returning to room_1, then step7 is gotoobject, step8 pick, step9 gotodoor, step10 toggle. So total steps are 10.

Is there a way to make it shorter? Let's see.

Alternative approach: Instead of going to green_door_1, maybe the agent can go to red_door_2 first, unlock it, then go to room_3, then go to green_door_1 and toggle it. But maybe there's a more optimal path.

But the constraints are satisfied, and the plan length seems acceptable. Let's check if there's a shorter path.

Wait, perhaps the agent can go to red_door_2, unlock it (steps 1-2), then go to room_3 (step3), then go to green_door_1 (step4), which satisfies constraint4. Then, return to room_1 (step5), pick up the ball (steps6-7), then go to red_door_1 (step8), toggle it (step9). So total steps are 9. How?

Wait:

1. gotodoor red_door_2 room_1 room_3
2. toggle red_door_2 (unlock)
3. gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_2 (now in room3)
4. gotodoor green_door_1 room3 room4 (now in front of green_door_1, meeting constraint4)
5. gotoroom room3 room1 red_door_2 (back to room1)
6. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room1
7. pick purple_ball_1 room1 (constraint1)
8. gotodoor red_door_1 room1 room2
9. toggle red_door_1 (unlock, meeting goal)

This is 9 steps, and all constraints are met. Let's check:

- Constraint4: step4 is in front of green_door_1. Yes.

- Constraint3: unlocking red_door_1 (step9) requires prior holding or being in front of red_door_2. The agent was in front of red_door_2 in step1. So that's prior. So constraint3 is satisfied.

Yes, this plan works. So that's shorter. So steps:

1. gotodoor red_door_2 room_1 room_3
2. toggle red_door_2
3. gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_2
4. gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4
5. gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_2
6. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_1
7. pick purple_ball_1 room_1
8. gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_2
9. toggle red_door_1

But wait, after step4, the agent is in front of green_door_1 (constraint4 met). Then, step5 is going back to room_1. Then steps 6-9.

But this plan is 9 steps. But wait, step5 is "gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_2", which requires that the agent is in room_3. Yes, after step3, they are in room3. So step4 is gotodoor green_door_1. Then, step5 is returning to room1. So step5 is valid.

But in step5, after returning to room1, the agent is in room1 again. Then step6 is going to purple_ball_1, pick it up (step7), then go to red_door_1 (step8), toggle (step9). That's correct.

This plan has 9 actions. Let's check if all preconditions are met:

- Step1: gotodoor red_door_2 in room1. Yes, agent is in room1.

- Step2: toggle red_door_2. Agent is in front of it (after step1). So yes.

- Step3: gotoroom from room1 to room3 via red_door_2, which is now unlocked. Yes.

- Step4: gotodoor green_door_1 in room3. Agent is in room3. Door green_door_1 connects room3 and room4. So yes.

- Step5: gotoroom room3 to room1 via red_door_2 (unlocked). Yes.

- Step6: gotoobject purple_ball_1 in room1. Yes.

- Step7: pick purple_ball_1 in room1. Agent is in room1, holding nothing. Yes.

- Step8: gotodoor red_door_1 in room1. Yes.

- Step9: toggle red_door_1. Agent is in front of it. Yes.

All preconditions are met. So this plan works.

But what about step5: after step4, the agent is in front of green_door_1. Then, to go back to room1 via red_door_2, the agent needs to first go to red_door_2 in room3. Wait, no. After step4, agent is in room3 in front of green_door_1. To go back to room1, they need to use red_door_2 in room3. But the agent is in room3, so the gotoroom action would be "gotoroom room3 room1 red_door_2". So step5 is correct.

But to perform gotoroom room3 room1 red_door_2, the agent needs to be in front of red_door_2 in room3. But after step4, the agent is in front of green_door_1. So before step5, the agent needs to go to red_door_2 in room3. So the plan is missing that step.

Ah, here's a mistake. After step4 (in front of green_door_1), the agent is in room3, but not in front of red_door_2. To use gotoroom to go back to room1, they must be in front of red_door_2 in room3. So after step4, they need to go to red_door_2 in room3.

So steps would be:

After step4 (in front of green_door_1):

5. gotodoor red_door_2 room3 room1 (since red_door_2 connects room3 and room1, from room3's perspective, the door connects to room1)

6. toggle red_door_2 (but wait, it's already unlocked from step2. So toggling would lock it again. Oh no! That's a problem. Because after step2, red_door_2 is unlocked. So when the agent returns to room3, they need to use red_door_2 (which is unlocked) to go back. But to use gotoroom, the door must be unlocked. So step5 would be:

5. gotodoor red_door_2 room3 room1

6. gotoroom room3 room1 red_door_2

But wait, the agent is in room3, and red_door_2 connects room3 and room1. So "gotodoor red_door_2 room3 room1" would allow the agent to approach the door. Then, since the door is unlocked (from step2), the agent can use gotoroom to go back.

But step5 would be:

5. gotodoor red_door_2 room3 room1 (agent is now in front of red_door_2 in room3)

6. gotoroom room3 room1 red_door_2 (back to room1)

Then proceed to step7: gotoobject purple_ball_1, etc.

So the corrected plan would be:

1. gotodoor red_door_2 room_1 room_3
2. toggle red_door_2 (unlocks it)
3. gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_2 (now in room3)
4. gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4 (now in front of green_door_1)
5. gotodoor red_door_2 room_3 room_1 (move to red_door_2 in room3)
6. gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_2 (back to room1)
7. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_1
8. pick purple_ball_1 room_1
9. gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_2
10. toggle red_door_1

Now, this is 10 steps. But this adds steps to go to red_door_2 in room3. Otherwise, the agent can't use gotoroom to go back to room1 unless they are in front of the door.

So the previous plan was missing steps 5 and 6, making the total steps 10 instead of 9. So the correct plan is longer.

But without those steps, the agent can't return to room1. Because to use gotoroom, the agent must be in front of the door. So after step4 (in front of green_door_1 in room3), the agent is not in front of red_door_2. So they need to first go to red_door_2 in room3 (step5), then go through it (step6).

This adds two more steps. So the plan is 10 steps.

But let's check if there's a way to optimize. Maybe after step3 (in room3), the agent can go to red_door_2 in room3 (step4), then go back to room1 (step5), and then go to green_door_1 later? But constraint4 requires being in front of green_door_1. So agent has to go there.

Alternative plan:

After step3 (in room3):

4. gotodoor green_door_1 room3 room4 (step4)
5. (now in front of green_door_1, meets constraint4)
6. gotodoor red_door_2 room3 room1 (step5)
7. gotoroom room3 room1 red_door_2 (step6)
8. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room1 (step7)
9. pick (step8)
10. gotodoor red_door_1 (step9)
11. toggle (step10)

So that's 11 steps. 

But perhaps there's a smarter way. For example, after step3 (room3), the agent can go to green_door_1 (step4), then return to red_door_2 (step5), then go back to room1 (step6). Then proceed. So yes, that's 11 steps.

But the initial plan that was missing steps was invalid. So the correct plan must include these steps.

Therefore, the minimal steps are 10 or 11. But perhaps there's a way to meet constraint4 without going to green_door_1. Let's think. Is there any other way? The constraint requires being in front of green_door_1 at some state. So the agent must be in front of it. That requires going to it in room3 or room4. Since the agent starts in room1, and green_door_1 connects room3 and room4, the agent must reach room3 to get in front of green_door_1. Which requires unlocking red_door_2 (step2), going to room3 (step3), then to green_door_1 (step4), then back to room1 (steps5-6). So that's unavoidable.

So the minimal steps would be 10 actions:

1. gotodoor red_door_2 room1 room3
2. toggle red_door_2
3. gotoroom room1 room3 red_door_2
4. gotodoor green_door_1 room3 room4
5. gotodoor red_door_2 room3 room1
6. gotoroom room3 room1 red_door_2
7. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room1
8. pick purple_ball_1 room1
9. gotodoor red_door_1 room1 room2
10. toggle red_door_1

Now, let's check constraints again:

- Constraint1: step8, holding purple_ball_1. Yes.

- Constraint2: step10, red_door_1 is unlocked. Yes.

- Constraint3: step10 is unlocking red_door_1. Prior states: step8 (holding ball), which is before step10. So yes.

- Constraint4: step4, in front of green_door_1. Yes.

Yes, this plan works.

But perhaps the agent can drop the ball after picking it up, but it's not necessary. Since the only constraint is to hold it at least once. So step8 is sufficient.

So the plan is valid and meets all constraints and the goal. Now, the only question is whether there's a shorter plan. For example, can the agent avoid going to green_door_1? No, because constraint4 requires it.

Another possible optimization: After step4 (in front of green_door_1), can the agent proceed to room4, then come back, but that would require unlocking green_door_1. So:

After step4 (gotodoor green_door_1), step5: toggle green_door_1 (unlocks it), then step6: gotoroom room3 room4 green_door_1 (enters room4). Then step7: gotodoor green_door_1 room4 room3 (back to room3). Then step8: gotoroom room3 room4 green_door_1 again? But this adds steps. But it's necessary to meet constraint4.

Alternatively, after step4, the agent is in front of green_door_1. That's sufficient to meet constraint4. So they don't need to unlock it or go through it. Just being in front of it is enough. So steps 4 is sufficient for constraint4. So after step4, the agent can proceed to return to room1.

Thus, the previous plan with 10 steps is valid.

Another possible optimization: Can the agent toggle green_door_1 while in front of it (step4), but that's not necessary for the constraints. However, the action of toggling would change the door's state, but since it's not required by the goal, maybe it's better to not toggle it, saving a step.

But in the plan above, step4 is gotodoor green_door_1. That's sufficient to meet constraint4. Toggling is not needed. So the plan can omit step5 (toggle green_door_1), thus saving a step. Wait, but in the plan I outlined earlier, step5 is gotodoor red_door_2 room3 room1. So the previous plan doesn't toggle green_door_1. So that's okay.

So the plan is:

1. gotodoor red_door_2 room1 room3
2. toggle red_door_2 (unlock)
3. gotoroom room1 room3 red_door_2 (now in room3)
4. gotodoor green_door_1 room3 room4 (in front of green_door_1, meets constraint4)
5. gotodoor red_door_2 room3 room1 (move to red_door_2 in room3)
6. gotoroom room3 room1 red_door_2 (back to room1)
7. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room1
8. pick purple_ball_1 room1 (constraint1)
9. gotodoor red_door_1 room1 room2
10. toggle red_door_1 (unlocks, meets goal)

Yes, this is 10 steps, and all steps are necessary. So this is the optimal plan.
