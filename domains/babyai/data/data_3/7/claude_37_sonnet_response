Alright, I'm given a planning problem in a gridworld with 4 rooms arranged in a square formation. The goal is to have a plan that reaches a state where there's a door d that is red, connects room_2 and room_1, you are in front of it, and it is not locked.

Let me break down the problem:

1. Initial state:
   - You are in room_1.
   - Various objects (balls, boxes) are in different rooms.
   - All doors (red_door_1, red_door_2, yellow_door_1, green_door_1) are locked.
   - You're not holding any object.

2. Goal:
   - You are in front of a red door d, where d connects room_2 and room_1, and d is not locked.

   Given the descriptions, red_door_1 is the door that connects room_2 and room_1, and it's red. So the goal is to be in front of red_door_1, and for it to be unlocked.

3. Constraints:
   a. At some point in the plan, you must be holding purple_ball_1.
   b. At some point in the plan, red_door_1 should not be locked.
   c. If red_door_1 is not locked, then there should be an earlier state where you're either holding an object or are in front of red_door_2.
   d. At some point in the plan, you should be in front of green_door_1.

Now, let's think through a plan:

First, we need to satisfy constraint (a) by picking up purple_ball_1, which is in room_1. We can then drop it if needed.

Next, according to constraint (c), before we unlock red_door_1, we should either be holding an object or be in front of red_door_2. We can accomplish this by either continuing to hold purple_ball_1 or by going in front of red_door_2 (which connects room_1 and room_3).

After that, we need to satisfy constraint (d) by going in front of green_door_1, which connects room_3 and room_4.

Finally, we need to unlock red_door_1 and stand in front of it to achieve the main goal.

Let's plan this step by step:

1. We start in room_1 with purple_ball_1 and purple_box_1.
2. Go in front of purple_ball_1 in room_1.
3. Pick up purple_ball_1. Now we're holding it, which satisfies constraint (a).
4. Go in front of red_door_2 in room_1. This, combined with holding purple_ball_1, satisfies constraint (c).
5. Toggle red_door_2 to unlock it.
6. Go to room_3 from room_1 using red_door_2.
7. Go in front of green_door_1 in room_3. This satisfies constraint (d).
8. Toggle green_door_1 to unlock it (though we don't need to go through it).
9. Go in front of red_door_2 in room_3.
10. Drop purple_ball_1 in room_3. (Since we've already satisfied the constraint of holding it).
11. Go back to room_1 from room_3 using red_door_2.
12. Go in front of red_door_1 in room_1.
13. Toggle red_door_1 to unlock it. This satisfies constraint (b).
14. The goal is now met: We're in front of red_door_1, which is a red door connecting room_2 and room_1, and it's unlocked.

Actually, I think I misunderstood a bit. Let me reason it better.

When the goal says "you are in front of d", I need to ensure I'm in the correct room. If I'm in room_1, I'd be in front of red_door_1 (connecting to room_2). If I'm in room_2, I'd also be in front of red_door_1 (connecting to room_1).

Let's be more precise: the goal is to be in front of red_door_1 (which connects room_2 and room_1) and for it to be unlocked. The constraint says that before red_door_1 is unlocked, I should have either been holding an object or been in front of red_door_2.

Actually, it seems like my plan will work. But let me reconsider using the constraints:

1. At some point, I need to hold purple_ball_1.
2. At some point, red_door_1 should not be locked.
3. Before red_door_1 is unlocked, I should be holding an object or be in front of red_door_2.
4. At some point, I should be in front of green_door_1.

So, I think the more efficient plan is:

1. We start in room_1 with purple_ball_1 and purple_box_1.
2. Go in front of purple_ball_1 in room_1.
3. Pick up purple_ball_1. Now we're holding it, which satisfies constraint (a).
4. Go in front of red_door_2 in room_1 (connecting to room_3). This, combined with holding purple_ball_1, satisfies constraint (c).
5. Toggle red_door_2 to unlock it.
6. Go to room_3 from room_1 using red_door_2.
7. Go in front of green_door_1 in room_3 (connecting to room_4). This satisfies constraint (d).
8. Go in front of red_door_2 in room_3 (connecting to room_1).
9. Go back to room_1 from room_3 using red_door_2.
10. Go in front of red_door_1 in room_1 (connecting to room_2). (Hmm, but is this possible while holding purple_ball_1? Let's assume it is, unless the problem says objects or the agent occupy physical positions that could block a door).
11. Toggle red_door_1 to unlock it while holding purple_ball_1. This satisfies constraint (b).
12. Now, the goal is met: We're in front of red_door_1, which is a red door connecting room_2 and room_1, and it's unlocked. And we've also satisfied all the constraints.

Actually, the more I think about it, we might need to think about the physicality of the gridworld. If we can hold an object and still stand in front of a door, then the plan works. But if holding an object prevents us from being in front of a door (for instance, if the object is physically in your hands and blocks your view or access to the door), then we'd need to drop the object at some point.

But let's go with my plan, and adjust if necessary:

1. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_1
2. pick purple_ball_1 room_1
3. gotodoor red_door_2 room_1 room_3
4. toggle red_door_2
5. gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_2
6. gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4
7. gotodoor red_door_2 room_3 room_1
8. gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_2
9. gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_2
10. toggle red_door_1
11. gotoempty (to drop purple_ball_1 somewhere in room_1)
12. drop purple_ball_1 room_1
13. gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_2

Actually, I forgot after going to an empty spot, you need to decide where to drop the object. I'm deciding to drop it anywhere in room_1 for now.

Actually, I'm not sure this is correct. Let me consider the problem more carefully.

Based on the effects of "goto door": After performing this action regarding a door d, (i) if you were in front of some object or door x0, then you are no longer in front of x0 and (ii) you are in front of door d.

And based on the preconditions: "goto door": you may only go in front of a door d if (i) you are in a room which door d is connecting with another room, and (ii) there is no object blocking the position in front of d in the room you are currently in.

These suggest that we can be in front of a door while holding an object. The fact that the problem doesn't have a precondition for toggling a door about not holding an object also suggests that we can toggle a door while holding an object.

Ok, let me re-check the problem, I need to understand the goal more clearly: "There is a door d such that "The following conditions are all true: "d is red", "room_2 and room_1 are connected via d", "you are in front of d", "d is not locked"""

The goal is to be in front of a red door that connects room_2 and room_1, and the door should be unlocked.

The only door that satisfies "d is red" and "room_2 and room_1 are connected via d" is red_door_1. So, the goal is to be in front of red_door_1 and for it to be unlocked.

Let's confirm the constraints:
1. At some point, you must hold purple_ball_1.
2. At some point, red_door_1 should not be locked.
3. If red_door_1 is not locked, there should be an earlier state where you're either holding an object or in front of red_door_2.
4. At some point, you should be in front of green_door_1.

Is constraint 3 a bit ambiguous? It says: "If expression 'red_door_1 is not locked' holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: 'At least one of the following conditions is true: "you are holding some object", "you are in front of red_door_2"'"

This could be interpreted as: "If red_door_1 is unlocked at any point in the plan, then at an earlier stage in the plan, you must either be holding an object or be in front of red_door_2." Given this, I should ensure that before red_door_1 is unlocked, I've either held an object or been in front of red_door_2.

Let's check if my plan satisfies all these:

1. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_1
2. pick purple_ball_1 room_1 (satisfies constraint 1)
3. gotodoor red_door_2 room_1 room_3 (satisfies condition of being in front of red_door_2 for constraint 3)
4. toggle red_door_2
5. gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_2
6. gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4 (satisfies constraint 4)
7. gotodoor red_door_2 room_3 room_1
8. gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_2
9. gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_2
10. toggle red_door_1 (unlocks red_door_1, satisfies constraint 2. And since we've already been in front of red_door_2 in step 3, constraint 3 is also satisfied)

Now, red_door_1 is unlocked and we're in front of it, which meets the goal. And we've also satisfied all the constraints.

Wait, after toggling red_door_1, are we still in front of it? Let's check the effects of the toggle action: if you toggle a door d, (i) if d was locked, then it becomes unlocked, and (ii) if d was unlocked, then it becomes locked. There's nothing here that says we're no longer in front of the door, so I think after toggling, we're still in front of red_door_1.

Ok, so our final plan is:

1. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_1
2. pick purple_ball_1 room_1
3. gotodoor red_door_2 room_1 room_3
4. toggle red_door_2
5. gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_2
6. gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4
7. gotodoor red_door_2 room_3 room_1
8. gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_2
9. gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_2
10. toggle red_door_1

This plan should be correct and efficient, and it satisfies all the constraints.

But I just realized something: the goal is to have a state where you're in front of red_door_1, and red_door_1 is unlocked. But the door connects room_1 and room_2, so I could be in either room to be in front of it.

If I'm in room_1, I'd be in front of red_door_1 from the room_1 side. If I'm in room_2, I'd be in front of red_door_1 from the room_2 side.

But since we're starting in room_1 and we haven't gone to room_2 in our plan, we'd be in front of red_door_1 from the room_1 side, which should satisfy the goal. So, I think our plan is still correct.

Actually, hmm. I think the goal is to be in front of a red door that connects room_2 and room_1 (i.e., red_door_1), and for the door to be unlocked. And for the constraints:
1. At some point, you must hold purple_ball_1. (We do this.)
2. At some point, red_door_1 should not be locked. (We do this.)
3. If red_door_1 is not locked, there should be an earlier state where you're either holding an object (which we are) or in front of red_door_2 (which we've been). So, this constraint allows us to unlock red_door_1.
4. At some point, you should be in front of green_door_1. (We do this in step 6.)

Given all this, our plan should be valid. In the end, we're in front of red_door_1 in room_1, and red_door_1 is unlocked, which meets the goal.

Let's double check my plan:

1. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_1
2. pick purple_ball_1 room_1
3. gotodoor red_door_2 room_1 room_3
4. toggle red_door_2
5. gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_2
6. gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4
7. gotodoor red_door_2 room_3 room_1
8. gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_2
9. gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_2
10. toggle red_door_1

Hmm, I realize we're still holding purple_ball_1 at the end of this plan. But the goal doesn't specify whether we should be holding an object or not. It just says we should be in front of a red door that connects room_2 and room_1, and the door should be unlocked. So, I think our plan is still valid.

Let me double-check one more time to ensure I haven't missed anything.

First, let's review the goal: "There is a door d such that "The following conditions are all true: "d is red", "room_2 and room_1 are connected via d", "you are in front of d", "d is not locked"""

In our plan, the door d is red_door_1, which is red and connects room_2 and room_1. After executing our plan, we're in front of red_door_1 and it's unlocked. So the goal is met.

Now, let's review the constraints:

1. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'you are holding purple_ball_1'"
   - We pick up purple_ball_1 in step 2 and never drop it, so this constraint is met.

2. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'red_door_1 is not locked'"
   - We unlock red_door_1 in step 10, so this constraint is met.

3. "If expression 'red_door_1 is not locked' holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: 'At least one of the following conditions is true: "you are holding some object", "you are in front of red_door_2"'"
   - Red_door_1 is unlocked in step 10. Before that, we were holding purple_ball_1 from step 2 onwards, and we were in front of red_door_2 in steps 3 and 7. So, this constraint is met.

4. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'you are in front of green_door_1'"
   - We go in front of green_door_1 in step 6, so this constraint is met.

It looks like all the goals and constraints are satisfied by our plan.

1. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_1
2. pick purple_ball_1 room_1
3. gotodoor red_door_2 room_1 room_3
4. toggle red_door_2
5. gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_2
6. gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4
7. gotodoor red_door_2 room_3 room_1
8. gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_2
9. gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_2
10. toggle red_door_1

This is our final plan. It works and seems efficient. 

Actually, let me check if we can optimize our plan a bit:

We're doing a bit of a loop in steps 5, 7, and 8, where we go to room_3, then get in front of red_door_2 (on the room_3 side), and then go back to room_1. We could compress those steps:

1. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_1
2. pick purple_ball_1 room_1
3. gotodoor red_door_2 room_1 room_3
4. toggle red_door_2
5. gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_2
6. gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4
7. gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_2
8. gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_2
9. toggle red_door_1

This compresses the plan to 9 steps, but I'm not entirely sure if steps 6 and 7 can be executed directly in this manner. Let me think...

1. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_1: This means we go in front of purple_ball_1 in room_1.
2. pick purple_ball_1 room_1: We pick up purple_ball_1, which is now in our hands.
3. gotodoor red_door_2 room_1 room_3: We go in front of red_door_2 in room_1 (the door connects to room_3).
4. toggle red_door_2: We unlock red_door_2.
5. gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_2: We leave room_1 and enter room_3 through red_door_2.
6. gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4: We go in front of green_door_1 in room_3 (the door connects to room_4).
7. gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_2: Wait, this seems correct. If we're in front of green_door_1 in room_3, we want to go back to room_1. We need to go through red_door_2 to get to room_1. The question is, do we need to be in front of red_door_2 before using it? The precondition for "goto room" says: "(i) you are currently in a room r0 that is adjacent to r, and (ii) the door that is connecting r0 and r is unlocked." It doesn't explicitly say that you need to be in front of the door to use it, but it seems more intuitive. Let's be safer and include the step of going in front of red_door_2 before going to room_1.
8. gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_2: We go in front of red_door_1 in room_1 (the door connects to room_2).
9. toggle red_door_1: We unlock red_door_1.

So, our optimized plan (to be safe) would be:

1. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_1
2. pick purple_ball_1 room_1
3. gotodoor red_door_2 room_1 room_3
4. toggle red_door_2
5. gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_2
6. gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4
7. gotodoor red_door_2 room_3 room_1
8. gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_2
9. gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_2
10. toggle red_door_1

So, I'd stick with the original 10-step plan to ensure it's correct and valid.

With that, I conclude that the plan is:

```
gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_1
pick purple_ball_1 room_1
gotodoor red_door_2 room_1 room_3
toggle red_door_2
gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_2
gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4
gotodoor red_door_2 room_3 room_1
gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_2
gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_2
toggle red_door_1
```

This plan should satisfy the goal of being in front of an unlocked red_door_1 that connects room_2 and room_1, and it also meets all the constraints described.

Actually, wait. Let's make sure this really is the most efficient plan. Are there any steps we could skip? Is there a more direct path to the goal while still satisfying all the constraints?

Let's reconsider our plan:

1. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_1
2. pick purple_ball_1 room_1
3. gotodoor red_door_2 room_1 room_3
4. toggle red_door_2
5. gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_2
6. gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4
7. gotodoor red_door_2 room_3 room_1
8. gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_2
9. gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_2
10. toggle red_door_1

Steps 1-2: We need to hold purple_ball_1 at some point to satisfy constraint 1. We do this at the beginning, which is efficient.

Steps 3-4: Before red_door_1 can be unlocked, we need to either be holding an object (which we are) or be in front of red_door_2 (constraint 3). So, even though we're already holding an object, we also go in front of red_door_2 and unlock it so we can go to room_3.

Steps 5-6: We go to room_3 to get in front of green_door_1, satisfying constraint 4.

Steps 7-8: We return to room_1.

Steps 9-10: We go in front of red_door_1 and unlock it, satisfying the main goal and constraint 2.

Given that we need to satisfy constraints 1, 3, and 4 before reaching the goal, and each of them requires specific steps, I think our plan is already pretty efficient. I can't immediately see a way to reduce the number of steps while still satisfying all constraints.

So, I'll stick with the 10-step plan:

```
gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_1
pick purple_ball_1 room_1
gotodoor red_door_2 room_1 room_3
toggle red_door_2
gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_2
gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4
gotodoor red_door_2 room_3 room_1
gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_2
gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_2
toggle red_door_1
```

Actually, there's a simpler plan. Let's focus on the constraints:

1. Hold purple_ball_1 at some point.
2. Have red_door_1 unlocked at some point.
3. Before red_door_1 is unlocked, either hold an object or be in front of red_door_2.
4. Be in front of green_door_1 at some point.

But these don't necessarily have to be in the order I've been planning. If I can be in front of red_door_2 without holding an object, and then pick up purple_ball_1 later, I might save a step:

1. gotodoor red_door_2 room_1 room_3 (getting in front of red_door_2, which helps with constraint 3)
2. toggle red_door_2 (unlocking red_door_2)
3. gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_2 (going to room_3)
4. gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4 (satisfying constraint 4)
5. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_3 (oops, this won't work because purple_ball_1 is in room_1)

Actually, no, this doesn't seem to save any steps, and might even be less efficient.

Let's proceed with the original plan:

```
gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_1
pick purple_ball_1 room_1
gotodoor red_door_2 room_1 room_3
toggle red_door_2
gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_2
gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4
gotodoor red_door_2 room_3 room_1
gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_2
gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_2
toggle red_door_1
```

This plan seems to be the most efficient way to satisfy all goals and constraints.
