Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. Hmm, the goal is to have a green box that I'm holding. So I need to pick up a green box. Looking at the initial state, the green boxes are green_box_1 in room_2 and green_box_2 in room_2. So I need to get to room_2 and pick one of them.

But wait, the constraints complicate things. Let's list them out:

1. Must hold an object at least once. That's part of the goal anyway, so that's covered.
2. If holding an object, must have been in front of green_door_1 before. So before any pick action, I need to have been in front of green_door_1.
3. Must be in front of green_box_1 at some point. So even if I pick green_box_2, I need to visit green_box_1's location.
4. If in front of green_box_1, then either hold blue_box_2 or be in front of red_ball_1 at that state or later.
5. Must be in room_1 at least once.
6. If in room_1, must have held an object before entering.

Starting in room_3. The doors are all locked initially. So first, I need to unlock doors. Let's see the connections:

room_1 is connected to room_3 via red_door_1. But red_door_1 is locked. So to get from room_3 to room_1, need to unlock red_door_1. But to unlock a door, I need to be in front of it and toggle it. So to get to red_door_1, I need to go in front of it while in room_3 or room_1. Since I'm in room_3 initially, maybe I can go to the door and unlock it.

Wait, but the doors are between rooms. So for example, red_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3. So in room_3, I can go to red_door_1. Let me check the preconditions for gotodoor. The preconditions for gotodoor d r1 r2: I must be in a room connected by d, and there's no object blocking the door's position. Are there any objects blocking doors in the initial state? The initial state lists objects in rooms, but not their positions. The problem says that "goto door" requires that the position in front of the door in the current room is not blocked. Since the initial state doesn't mention any objects blocking doors, maybe they are not blocked. So I can go to the door.

So step 1: From room_3, goto red_door_1 (which connects room_3 and room_1). Then toggle it to unlock. Then go through to room_1.

But the goal also requires being in room_1, so that's good. But constraint 6 says that if I'm in room_1, I must have held an object before. So entering room_1 would require that I had held an object before. But initially, I'm not holding anything. So I can't just go to room_1 first. Wait, so I need to hold an object before entering room_1. But to hold an object, I need to pick it up. The initial room is room_3, which has yellow_ball_1. So maybe I can pick up the yellow ball first. But then, when I go to room_1, I need to have held an object before. Let me think.

Wait, the constraints say that if I am in room_1 in some state, there must be an earlier state where I held an object. So before entering room_1 for the first time, I need to have held an object. So maybe the sequence would be: pick up yellow_ball_1 in room_3, then proceed to unlock red_door_1 and enter room_1. But how?

Wait, in room_3, I can pick up the yellow_ball_1. Let's see. The initial state: you are in room_3, yellow_ball_1 is there. So:

1. gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_3
2. pick yellow_ball_1 room_3

Then, I'm holding it. Then, I can proceed to unlock the red_door_1. Wait, but to unlock a door, I need to be in front of it. So after picking up the ball, I need to go to the red_door_1 in room_3.

So:

3. gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1
4. toggle red_door_1

Now, the door is unlocked. Then, I can go through to room_1.

5. gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1

But wait, the action is "gotoroom r1 r2 d". So from room_3 (r1) to room_1 (r2) via red_door_1. That would work. But after entering room_1, I need to satisfy constraint 5: be in room_1. Also, constraint 6 is satisfied because I held the yellow ball before entering.

But then, the goal is to hold a green box. The green boxes are in room_2. To get to room_2 from room_1, there's purple_door_1 connecting room_1 and room_2. But purple_door_1 is locked. So need to unlock that. To unlock purple_door_1, I need to be in front of it. So from room_1, goto purple_door_1 (gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2), toggle it. Then go to room_2.

But before that, after entering room_1, I need to drop the yellow ball to free my hands? Wait, but the constraint 2 says that whenever I'm holding an object, I must have been in front of green_door_1 earlier. But in this case, when I picked up the yellow ball in room_3, I wasn't in front of green_door_1. So that violates the constraint. Oh right! So constraint 2: if I hold any object, there must have been a prior state where I was in front of green_door_1. So picking up the yellow_ball_1 in room_3 would require that before that action, I was in front of green_door_1. But green_door_1 connects room_3 and room_4. So how do I get there?

Wait, initial location is room_3. green_door_1 connects room_3 and room_4. But to go to room_4, I need to go through green_door_1. But green_door_1 is locked. So to unlock it, I need to be in front of it. But if I'm in room_3, I can go to green_door_1. But the problem is that when I pick up the yellow ball, I need to have been in front of green_door_1 before. So perhaps the plan needs to first go to green_door_1, then go to yellow_ball_1 and pick it up.

Wait, let's outline steps:

Need to satisfy that when I pick up the yellow_ball_1 (which is the first holding action), I must have been in front of green_door_1 before. So:

1. In room_3, goto green_door_1 (gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4)
2. Then, go to yellow_ball_1 (gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_3)
3. pick yellow_ball_1 room_3

That way, before holding the object (yellow_ball_1), I was in front of green_door_1. That satisfies constraint 2.

But also, the constraint 4: when in front of green_box_1 (which is in room_2), then either I hold blue_box_2 (in room_4) or am in front of red_ball_1 (in room_1) at that state or later.

So when I eventually go to green_box_1 in room_2, I need to make sure that after that, either I pick up blue_box_2 or go to red_ball_1.

But let's think step by step.

Current plan outline:

Start in room_3.

1. gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4 (to satisfy constraint 2 before picking up anything)
2. gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_3
3. pick yellow_ball_1 room_3 (now holding it)
4. Now, need to go to room_1. But to get to room_1 from room_3, need to unlock red_door_1. So:

4. gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1
5. toggle red_door_1 (unlock it)
6. gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1 (now in room_1, which satisfies constraint 5. Also, constraint 6 is met because we held the yellow ball before entering room_1)

But we need to be in room_1. Now, in room_1, there's red_ball_1 and grey_box_1. But the goal is to get a green box. So from room_1, we can go to room_2 via purple_door_1, but that's locked. So need to unlock purple_door_1. Steps:

7. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2
8. toggle purple_door_1 (unlock)
9. gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1 (now in room_2)

In room_2, we have green_box_1, grey_ball_1, green_box_2. Now, need to pick up a green box. Let's choose green_box_1. But constraint 3 says we must be in front of green_box_1 at least once. So:

10. gotoobject green_box_1 room_2
11. Now, constraint 4: when in front of green_box_1, then either hold blue_box_2 (in room_4) or be in front of red_ball_1 (in room_1) at that state or after.

So after step 10, we need to ensure that either we pick up blue_box_2 later or go to red_ball_1. But since our goal is to hold a green box (green_box_1 or 2), maybe after picking green_box_1, we need to handle that. Wait, but we can't pick it yet because we're holding the yellow ball. So first, perhaps drop the yellow ball, then pick up the green box. But need to think about constraints.

Wait, current holding is yellow_ball_1. To pick up green_box_1, need to drop the yellow ball first. Let's see:

11. drop yellow_ball_1 room_2 (but need to be in front of an empty position to drop. Wait, the drop action requires that the position in front is empty. So after step 10, we are in front of green_box_1. So to drop, we need to gotoempty first.

Wait, drop action's precondition: (i) holding x, (ii) position in front is empty. So after step 10, we are in front of green_box_1. So we can't drop there. So need to go to an empty spot.

So:

11. gotoempty (in room_2)
12. drop yellow_ball_1 room_2 (now holding nothing)
13. gotoobject green_box_1 room_2 (to satisfy constraint 3)
14. Now, in front of green_box_1. At this state (step 13), we need to ensure that either we are holding blue_box_2 or in front of red_ball_1 now or later. Since we are not holding blue_box_2 (it's in room_4), maybe we need to go to red_ball_1 later. But how?

After step 13, perhaps we proceed to pick up green_box_1:

14. pick green_box_1 room_2 (but we need to be in front of it. Wait, step 13 is gotoobject green_box_1, so we are in front. Then, pick it up. But we need to ensure that after being in front of green_box_1 (step 13), we either hold blue_box_2 or are in front of red_ball_1. So after step 13, when we pick up green_box_1, we are holding it. That's part of the goal. But does that satisfy the constraint? Let's see: the constraint says that if in front of green_box_1 (state 13), then either at that state or later, we hold blue_box_2 or are in front of red_ball_1.

After step 13 (state where in front of green_box_1), the next steps could be:

14. pick green_box_1 room_2 (now holding it, which is the goal. Then, the plan ends. But we need to check if the constraint is met. At state 13, we are in front of green_box_1. Then, after that, we pick it up. So the constraint requires that either at state 13 or later, we hold blue_box_2 or are in front of red_ball_1. But after state 13, we are holding green_box_1, which is not blue_box_2, and we are not in front of red_ball_1. So this violates the constraint. Therefore, this path is invalid.

So to satisfy constraint 4 after being in front of green_box_1, we need to either:

a) After being in front of green_box_1 (step 13), go to red_ball_1 (which is in room_1) later. Or,

b) At some point hold blue_box_2 after being in front of green_box_1.

Option a: After step 13, we need to go back to room_1 and be in front of red_ball_1.

But how? Let's outline.

After step 13 (in front of green_box_1 in room_2), we can:

14. gotoempty (room_2)
15. pick green_box_1 (but then we need to have been in front of green_door_1 before. Wait, no. The constraint 2 is that whenever you hold an object, there's a prior state where you were in front of green_door_1. So when you pick green_box_1, you need to have been in front of green_door_1 earlier.

But in the current plan, when we pick up the yellow_ball_1, we were in front of green_door_1 (step 1). But when picking green_box_1, do we need to have been in front of green_door_1 again? Yes. Because each time you hold an object, the constraint requires that there's a prior state where you were in front of green_door_1.

Wait, the constraint says: "If you are holding some object in some state, there must be an earlier state where you were in front of green_door_1." So for each time you hold an object, you need to have been in front of green_door_1 before that.

So when we pick up green_box_1, we need to have been in front of green_door_1 before that action. So in the current plan, after step 13 (in front of green_box_1), we need to go to green_door_1 again? But green_door_1 is between room_3 and room_4, but we're in room_2. How to get there?

Alternatively, maybe earlier steps should include being in front of green_door_1 again. This complicates things.

Alternatively, perhaps instead of picking up the yellow ball first, find another way. But let's try to adjust the current plan.

So, after step 13 (in front of green_box_1), we need to go to green_door_1 again before picking it up. But green_door_1 is in room_3 and room_4. We are in room_2. So to get to green_door_1, we need to go through room_3 or room_4.

But room_2 is connected to room_4 via red_door_2, which is locked. So steps to unlock red_door_2:

From room_2, need to unlock red_door_2. But red_door_2 is locked. So:

14. gotodoor red_door_2 room_2 room_4
15. toggle red_door_2 (unlock)
16. gotoroom room_2 room_4 red_door_2 (now in room_4)
17. Now in room_4. To get to green_door_1, which connects room_3 and room_4. So:

17. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3
18. toggle green_door_1 (unlock it)
19. Now, goto green_door_1 (but we are already in front of it). Wait, after step 17, we are in front of green_door_1 in room_4. Then, step 17 is gotodoor, which puts us in front of it. Then step 18 is toggle. Then, perhaps we can go back to room_3 via green_door_1.

But why? To get to green_door_1's front again. But perhaps this is getting too complicated. Let's see: the constraint for picking up green_box_1 is that before holding it, we were in front of green_door_1. So if we go to green_door_1 again after step 13, then pick green_box_1, that would satisfy constraint 2.

But this is getting too lengthy. Maybe there's a better approach. Let's think again.

Alternative plan: Instead of picking up the yellow ball first, maybe use another object. But the only other objects in room_3 are none except the yellow_ball_1. So that's the only one.

Wait, the initial state in room_3 has yellow_ball_1 and the agent. So to satisfy constraint 2, the first holding action must be preceded by being in front of green_door_1.

So steps:

1. goto green_door_1 from room_3 (gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4)
2. toggle green_door_1 (unlock)
3. Now, can go to room_4 through green_door_1. But maybe not necessary yet. Then, go to yellow_ball_1:

3. gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_3
4. pick yellow_ball_1 room_3

This way, before holding the yellow_ball_1 (step4), we were in front of green_door_1 (step1), satisfying constraint2.

Now, to go to room_1:

5. goto red_door_1 in room_3
6. toggle red_door_1 (unlock)
7. gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1 (now in room_1)

Constraint5 (be in room_1) satisfied. Constraint6 (entering room_1 after holding object) satisfied.

Now, in room_1, need to go to room_2 via purple_door_1 (locked). So:

8. goto purple_door_1 in room_1
9. toggle purple_door_1 (unlock)
10. gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1 (now in room2)

In room2, need to pick up green_box_1 or 2. Let's pick green_box_1.

11. gotoobject green_box_1 room2 (satisfies constraint3)
12. Now, must ensure that after this, either hold blue_box_2 or be in front of red_ball_1.

But currently holding yellow_ball_1. So need to drop it first. But to drop, need to be in front of an empty spot.

13. gotoempty room2
14. drop yellow_ball_1 room2
15. Now, go back to green_box_1:
    gotoobject green_box_1 room2
16. pick green_box_1 room2

But before picking it up, need to check constraint2: before holding green_box_1, must have been in front of green_door_1. But the last time we were in front of green_door_1 was step1. So that's okay. Because step1 was before step16.

So now, we are holding green_box_1. Which is the goal. But constraint4: after being in front of green_box_1 (step11 and 15), we need to either hold blue_box_2 or be in front of red_ball_1.

At step11: we were in front of green_box_1. Then steps 13-15: we drop the yellow ball, then go back to green_box_1 and pick it up. So during step11, the constraint4 requires that in step11 or after, we have either held blue_box_2 or been in front of red_ball_1.

But in the current plan, after step11, we don't do either. So this violates constraint4.

Hmm. So after step11 (in front of green_box_1), we need to arrange to either hold blue_box_2 or be in front of red_ball_1.

Possible solution: after step11, go to room_4 and pick up blue_box_2, then return.

But how?

From room_2, we can go to room_4 via red_door_2, which is locked. So need to unlock it.

So after step10 (in room2), steps:

11. goto red_door_2 room2 room4
12. toggle red_door_2 (unlock)
13. gotoroom room2 room4 red_door_2 (now in room4)
14. gotoobject blue_box_2 room4
15. pick blue_box_2 room4 (but before picking, need to be in front of green_door_1. Oh no, here's a problem. Because constraint2 says that whenever you hold an object, you must have been in front of green_door_1 before. So when we pick blue_box_2, we need to have been in front of green_door_1 before. But in this path, the last time we were in front of green_door_1 was step1. So that's okay, since step1 is before step15. So that's acceptable.

But then, after picking blue_box_2, we need to go back to room2 and handle green_box_1.

But this is getting complicated. Let's outline:

Current steps after entering room2 (step10):

10. in room2

11. goto red_door_2 room2 room4
12. toggle red_door_2 (unlock)
13. gotoroom room2 room4 red_door_2 (now in room4)
14. goto green_door_1 from room4 (gotodoor green_door_1 room4 room3) [to satisfy constraint2 for picking blue_box_2 later?]

Wait, no. constraint2 requires that before picking up any object, you were in front of green_door_1. Since we were in front of green_door_1 in step1, which is before step15 (pick blue_box_2), that's okay. So no need to go to green_door_1 again here.

So:

14. gotoobject blue_box_2 room4
15. pick blue_box_2 room4 (now holding it)
16. drop blue_box_2 room4 (but why? We need to go back to room2 to handle green_box_1. But this may not be necessary.)

Alternatively, after picking blue_box_2, go back to room2 and then to green_box_1.

16. gotoroom room4 room2 red_door_2 (since red_door_2 is unlocked)
17. gotoobject green_box_1 room2 (satisfy constraint3)
18. Now, in front of green_box_1. Since we are holding blue_box_2, constraint4 is satisfied because at this state (step18), we are holding blue_box_2. So condition met.

Then, we can drop blue_box_2 and pick green_box_1.

19. gotoempty room2
20. drop blue_box_2 room2
21. gotoobject green_box_1 room2
22. pick green_box_1 room2

Now, the goal is achieved (holding green_box_1). Let's check constraints:

Constraint2: each time we pick an object (yellow_ball_1, blue_box_2, green_box_1), we must have been in front of green_door_1 before. For yellow_ball_1, step1. For blue_box_2, step1 is before. For green_box_1, step1 is before. So okay.

Constraint4: when in front of green_box_1 (step17 and 21), during those states or after, we are holding blue_box_2 (step18-20) or in front of red_ball_1. In step18, holding blue_box_2 satisfies it. For step21, after dropping blue_box_2, we need to ensure that in some later state we are in front of red_ball_1. Wait, no. The constraint says that if you are in front of green_box_1 in any state, then either at that state or after, you are holding blue_box_2 or in front of red_ball_1.

In step17 (first time in front of green_box_1), we are holding blue_box_2 (from step15 to step20). So that satisfies the constraint. Then in step21 (second time in front of green_box_1), after dropping blue_box_2, we need to have either hold it again or be in front of red_ball_1. But we are going to pick green_box_1 next. So perhaps after step22, we need to go to red_ball_1.

But the goal is achieved at step22. So the plan ends. So constraint4 for step21: after being in front of green_box_1 (step21), we pick it up (step22). But after that, no actions. So to satisfy the constraint, during step21 or after, we need to hold blue_box_2 or be in front of red_ball_1. Since after step21, we are in front of green_box_1, then pick it up. But after that, we are holding green_box_1. So not holding blue_box_2. Also, not in front of red_ball_1. So this violates constraint4.

Hmm, this is getting really complicated. Maybe there's a better approach. Let's think of another way.

What if after picking green_box_1, we go to red_ball_1 in room_1 to satisfy the constraint. But how?

After step22 (holding green_box_1), we need to go to room_1. To get there, from room2, we can go through purple_door_1 (already unlocked). So:

23. gotoroom room2 room1 purple_door_1
24. gotoobject red_ball_1 room1

Now, in front of red_ball_1. This would satisfy the constraint for step21 (being in front of green_box_1) because after that, we are in front of red_ball_1.

But this adds steps. The plan is getting long. However, since the problem requires an optimal plan (shortest possible), this approach might not be optimal. Maybe there's a shorter path.

Alternative idea: Instead of going through room_4 and picking blue_box_2, after being in front of green_box_1, go to red_ball_1.

So after step11 (in front of green_box_1 in room2), drop the yellow ball, then go to red_ball_1 in room1.

Steps:

11. gotoobject green_box_1 room2 (constraint3 met)
12. gotoempty room2
13. drop yellow_ball_1 room2
14. gotoroom room2 room1 purple_door_1
15. gotoobject red_ball_1 room1

Now, in front of red_ball_1. This satisfies constraint4 for step11, because after being in front of green_box_1, we are now in front of red_ball_1. Then, go back to room2 and pick up green_box_1.

16. gotoroom room1 room2 purple_door_1
17. gotoobject green_box_1 room2
18. pick green_box_1 room2 (now holding it)

But before picking green_box_1, need to ensure that we were in front of green_door_1. Which we were in step1. So that's okay. Now, the goal is achieved. And constraints:

- Constraint4: after step11 (front of green_box_1), we go to red_ball_1 (step15), satisfying the condition.

This seems better. Let's outline this path:

Initial steps:

1. gotodoor green_door_1 room3 room4 (front of green_door_1)
2. toggle green_door_1 (unlock)
3. gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room3
4. pick yellow_ball_1 room3 (now holding)
5. gotodoor red_door_1 room3 room1
6. toggle red_door_1 (unlock)
7. gotoroom room3 room1 red_door_1 (in room1)
8. gotodoor purple_door_1 room1 room2
9. toggle purple_door_1 (unlock)
10. gotoroom room1 room2 purple_door_1 (in room2)
11. gotoobject green_box_1 room2 (constraint3 met)
12. gotoempty room2
13. drop yellow_ball_1 room2
14. gotoroom room2 room1 purple_door_1 (back to room1)
15. gotoobject red_ball_1 room1 (now in front of red_ball_1)
16. gotoroom room1 room2 purple_door_1 (back to room2)
17. gotoobject green_box_1 room2
18. pick green_box_1 room2

Now, check constraints:

- constraint2: each time we pick up an object (steps4 and 18), we had been in front of green_door_1 (step1) before. So yes.
- constraint3: step11 and 17.
- constraint4: after step11 (front of green_box_1), we later go to red_ball_1 (step15), so satisfies.
- constraint5: step7 (in room1)
- constraint6: step7 (entered room1 after holding yellow_ball_1)

This seems to satisfy all constraints. But the plan is quite long. Is there a shorter way?

Wait, maybe after dropping the yellow ball in room2 (step13), instead of going to room1, can we go to room4 and pick blue_box_2? But that would require unlocking red_door_2. Let's see:

After step13 (in room2, dropped yellow ball), steps:

14. goto red_door_2 room2 room4
15. toggle red_door_2 (unlock)
16. gotoroom room2 room4 red_door_2 (now in room4)
17. gotoobject blue_box_2 room4
18. pick blue_box_2 room4 (now holding)
19. gotoroom room4 room2 red_door_2 (back to room2)
20. gotoobject green_box_1 room2
21. drop blue_box_2 room2 (if needed)
22. pick green_box_1 room2

But this adds steps. But maybe it's shorter. However, step18 requires that before picking blue_box_2, we were in front of green_door_1 (step1). Which is true. Then, after picking blue_box_2, when in front of green_box_1 (step20), we are holding blue_box_2, satisfying constraint4. Then, drop it and pick green_box_1.

This approach may have fewer steps. Let's count:

Original plan steps: 18 steps. Alternative plan steps: 22 steps. Not better.

Hmm. So the first approach is better.

But let's count steps in the first approach:

1. gotodoor green_door_1 room3 room4
2. toggle green_door_1
3. gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room3
4. pick yellow_ball_1 room3
5. gotodoor red_door_1 room3 room1
6. toggle red_door_1
7. gotoroom room3 room1 red_door_1
8. gotodoor purple_door_1 room1 room2
9. toggle purple_door_1
10. gotoroom room1 room2 purple_door_1
11. gotoobject green_box_1 room2
12. gotoempty room2
13. drop yellow_ball_1 room2
14. gotoroom room2 room1 purple_door_1
15. gotoobject red_ball_1 room1
16. gotoroom room1 room2 purple_door_1
17. gotoobject green_box_1 room2
18. pick green_box_1 room2

That's 18 actions. But maybe some steps can be optimized.

Wait, after step10 (in room2), goto green_box_1 (step11), then drop yellow_ball_1 (steps12-13). Then go to room1 (step14), goto red_ball_1 (step15), back to room2 (step16), goto green_box_1 (step17), pick (step18).

Is there a way to avoid going back and forth?

Alternative idea: after step13 (drop yellow_ball_1 in room2), instead of going to room1, maybe go to room4 and pick blue_box_2, then return to room2 and pick green_box_1. But that requires unlocking red_door_2.

But that would add steps. Let's see:

After step13:

14. goto red_door_2 room2 room4
15. toggle red_door_2 (unlock)
16. gotoroom room2 room4 red_door_2 (room4)
17. gotoobject blue_box_2 room4
18. pick blue_box_2 room4 (now holding)
19. gotoroom room4 room2 red_door_2 (back to room2)
20. gotoobject green_box_1 room2 (now holding blue_box_2; this satisfies constraint4)
21. drop blue_box_2 room2 (need to gotoempty first?)
22. gotoempty room2
23. drop blue_box_2 room2
24. gotoobject green_box_1 room2
25. pick green_box_1 room2

This results in 25 steps, which is longer. Not better.

Another idea: after step10 (in room2), can we pick green_box_2 instead? But the same issue applies. The constraint3 requires being in front of green_box_1. So regardless of which green box is picked, we must go to green_box_1.

Alternatively, maybe pick green_box_2 and also visit green_box_1. But that might not help.

Alternatively, perhaps use the grey_box_1 in room_1. But it's grey, not green.

So the first approach seems necessary.

Now, checking if all constraints are met:

- The goal is to hold a green box. Step18: pick green_box_1. Yes.
- Constraint1: hold an object. Steps4 and 18. Yes.
- Constraint2: for each holding action (4 and 18), prior state in front of green_door_1 (step1). Yes.
- Constraint3: in front of green_box_1 (steps11, 17). Yes.
- Constraint4: after step11 (front of green_box_1), later in step15 (front of red_ball_1). Yes.
- Constraint5: in room_1 (step7). Yes.
- Constraint6: entered room_1 (step7) after holding yellow_ball_1 (step4). Yes.

Yes, all constraints are met.

But is this the shortest plan? Let's see if any steps can be merged or removed.

For example, after step7 (in room1), we go to purple_door_1 (step8), toggle it (step9), go to room2 (step10). Is there a way to merge some steps?

Alternatively, after step7, can we go directly to purple_door_1 without using gotodoor? No, because you can't goto a door unless you are in a room connected by it. Since you are in room1, which is connected to room2 via purple_door_1, you can goto the door.

Alternatively, when in room1, gotodoor purple_door_1 room1 room2 (step8), toggle (step9), gotoroom (step10). Necessary.

So steps8-10 are required.

Similarly, after dropping the yellow ball in room2 (step13), going to room1 (step14) and then to red_ball_1 (step15), then back to room2 (step16), etc. These steps seem necessary to satisfy constraint4.

So the plan is 18 steps long. Is there a shorter way?

Wait, perhaps after dropping the yellow ball (step13), instead of going to room1, can we just go to room4, pick blue_box_2, and then return. But that requires unlocking red_door_2. But then, the steps would be:

13. drop yellow_ball_1 room2
14. goto red_door_2 room2 room4
15. toggle red_door_2
16. gotoroom room2 room4 red_door_2
17. gotoobject blue_box_2 room4
18. pick blue_box_2 room4 (now holding)
19. gotoroom room4 room2 red_door_2
20. gotoobject green_box_1 room2 (now holding blue_box_2, satisfies constraint4)
21. drop blue_box_2 room2
22. gotoobject green_box_1 room2
23. pick green_box_1 room2

This is 23 steps. Longer than the previous 18. Not better.

Alternatively, after step13, can we pick green_box_1 without going to room1? But then, after step11 (front of green_box_1), we need to satisfy constraint4. If we don't go to room1 or pick blue_box_2, then it's a violation.

So the initial plan seems to be the shortest possible.
