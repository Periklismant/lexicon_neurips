**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Go to & Unlock blue_door_1 (room_2 → room_1):**  
   - Move to blue_door_1 in room_2, toggle to unlock it (required to access room_1).

2. **Move to room_1:**  
   - Use blue_door_1 to enter room_1, satisfying the constraint that being in room_4 later requires prior presence in room_1.

3. **Go to & Unlock blue_door_2 (room_1 → room_3):**  
   - Move to blue_door_2 in room_1, toggle to unlock it (required to access room_3).

4. **Move to room_3:**  
   - Use blue_door_2 to enter room_3.

5. **Go to & Unlock green_door_1 (room_3 → room_4):**  
   - Move to green_door_1 in room_3, toggle to unlock it. This satisfies the "in front of green_door_1" constraint.

6. **Move to room_4:**  
   - Use green_door_1 to enter room_4.

7. **Navigate to purple_ball_1:**  
   - Finally, move to the purple_ball_1 in room_4 to satisfy the goal.

**Constraints Met:**  
- "In front of green_door_1" during step 5.  
- "In room_4" in the final state, preceded by being in room_1 (step 2).  
- "blue_door_3 is locked" in all states (never interacted with).  
- Optimal plan length (10 actions).
