Let me understand the problem first:

We have a gridworld with 4 rooms arranged in a square formation, with doors connecting them. The rooms may contain boxes and balls. The possible actions are to move to objects, doors, or empty positions, pick up or drop objects, and toggle doors between locked and unlocked states.

The initial state:
- I am in room_2.
- grey_box_1 is in room_1.
- grey_box_2 and grey_box_3 are in room_2.
- purple_box_1, grey_box_4, and green_ball_1 are in room_3.
- purple_ball_1 and green_box_1 are in room_4.
- All doors (blue_door_1, blue_door_2, blue_door_3, green_door_1) are locked.
- Room connections: blue_door_1 connects room_1 and room_2, blue_door_2 connects room_1 and room_3, blue_door_3 connects room_2 and room_4, green_door_1 connects room_3 and room_4.

The goal:
- I need to be in room_4, in front of purple_ball_1, which is also in room_4.

The constraints:
1. At some point, I must be in front of green_door_1.
2. At some point, I must be in room_4.
3. If I am in room_4, there must be an earlier state where either I am in room_1 or I am holding purple_ball_1.
4. At every state, blue_door_3 must be locked.

So I need to plan a sequence of actions to satisfy the goal and constraints.

Let's start:

The fourth constraint is particularly important: blue_door_3 must always be locked. This door connects room_2 (where I start) and room_4 (where I need to go to achieve the goal). This means I cannot go directly from room_2 to room_4.

Given the third constraint, before I can be in room_4, I must either be in room_1 or be holding purple_ball_1. Additionally, purple_ball_1 is initially in room_4, and I'm not allowed to go directly to room_4 from room_2 because blue_door_3 must remain locked.

Analyzing the layout, I need to first go to room_1, then to room_3, and finally to room_4 via green_door_1 (which I need to visit at some point according to the first constraint).

Here's a plan:

1. From room_2, I need to go to room_1 via blue_door_1.
   - Go to blue_door_1 in room_2.
   - Unlock blue_door_1.
   - Go to room_1 via blue_door_1.

2. From room_1, I need to go to room_3 via blue_door_2.
   - Go to blue_door_2 in room_1.
   - Unlock blue_door_2.
   - Go to room_3 via blue_door_2.

3. From room_3, I need to go to room_4 via green_door_1.
   - Go to green_door_1 in room_3.
   - Unlock green_door_1.
   - Go to room_4 via green_door_1.

4. In room_4, I need to go in front of purple_ball_1.
   - Go to purple_ball_1 in room_4.

Let's convert this into the action format:

Actually, I need to carefully check the action format and constraints:
1. In the "goto_object" action, I need to specify the room. But if there are multiple objects, I need to specify which one.
2. In the "goto_door" action, I need to specify the door and the rooms it connects.
3. In the "goto_room" action, I need to specify the current room, the destination room, and the door.
4. In the "toggle" action, I need to know if I'm in front of the door.

Now, looking at the formulation of the actions, let me try again:

1. From room_2, I need to go to room_1 via blue_door_1.
   - "gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1" (Go to the door in room_2 that connects to room_1)
   - "toggle blue_door_1" (Unlock the door)
   - "gotoroom room_2 room_1 blue_door_1" (Go from room_2 to room_1 via the door)

2. From room_1, I need to go to room_3 via blue_door_2.
   - "gotodoor blue_door_2 room_1 room_3" (Go to the door in room_1 that connects to room_3)
   - "toggle blue_door_2" (Unlock the door)
   - "gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_2" (Go from room_1 to room_3 via the door)

3. From room_3, I need to go to room_4 via green_door_1.
   - "gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4" (Go to the door in room_3 that connects to room_4)
   - "toggle green_door_1" (Unlock the door)
   - "gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_1" (Go from room_3 to room_4 via the door)

4. In room_4, I need to go in front of purple_ball_1.
   - "gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4" (Go to the purple ball in room_4)

This should achieve my goal of being in room_4, in front of purple_ball_1. And it satisfies all the constraints: I have to go through room_1, I will be in front of green_door_1 at some point, and blue_door_3 remains locked throughout.

However, I need to double-check this plan to ensure it meets all the constraints:

1. At some point, I must be in front of green_door_1. ✓
   - This is satisfied in step 3.

2. At some point, I must be in room_4. ✓
   - This is satisfied in steps 3 and 4.

3. If I am in room_4, there must be an earlier state where either I am in room_1 or I am holding purple_ball_1. ✓
   - This is satisfied because I go through room_1 in step 2 before reaching room_4 in step 3.

4. At every state, blue_door_3 must be locked. ✓
   - This is satisfied because I never unlock or toggle blue_door_3.

wait...there's a subtlety about the action formats and effects that I should clarify:

- The "goto_object" action allows me to go in front of an object if I'm in the same room.
- The "goto_door" action allows me to go in front of a door if I'm in a room that the door connects to.
- The "toggle" action allows me to lock or unlock a door if I'm in front of the door.
- The "goto_room" action allows me to go to a room if I'm currently in a room that is adjacent to it and the door connecting them is unlocked.

So the action sequence should be:

From room_2, go to blue_door_1, unlock it, and go to room_1:
1. "gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1" (Go to the door in room_2)
2. "toggle blue_door_1" (Unlock the door)
3. "gotoroom room_2 room_1 blue_door_1" (Go to room_1)

From room_1, go to blue_door_2, unlock it, and go to room_3:
4. "gotodoor blue_door_2 room_1 room_3" (Go to the door in room_1)
5. "toggle blue_door_2" (Unlock the door)
6. "gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_2" (Go to room_3)

From room_3, go to green_door_1, unlock it, and go to room_4:
7. "gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4" (Go to the door in room_3)
8. "toggle green_door_1" (Unlock the door)
9. "gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_1" (Go to room_4)

In room_4, go to purple_ball_1:
10. "gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4" (Go to the purple ball in room_4)

Now, let's double-check this plan against all the constraints:

1. At some point, I must be in front of green_door_1. ✓
   - Step 7 satisfies this.

2. At some point, I must be in room_4. ✓
   - Steps 9 and 10 satisfy this.

3. If I am in room_4, there must be an earlier state where either I am in room_1 or I am holding purple_ball_1. ✓
   - Step 3 puts me in room_1 before Step 9 puts me in room_4.

4. At every state, blue_door_3 must be locked. ✓
   - I never toggle blue_door_3, so it remains locked throughout.

I believe this plan is valid. Let me verify it in a bit more detail:

Initial state: I'm in room_2, and all doors are locked.

Step 1: "gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1"
- I'm in room_2 and in front of blue_door_1.

Step 2: "toggle blue_door_1"
- I'm in room_2, in front of blue_door_1, and blue_door_1 is unlocked.

Step 3: "gotoroom room_2 room_1 blue_door_1"
- I'm in room_1 and blue_door_1 is unlocked.

Step 4: "gotodoor blue_door_2 room_1 room_3"
- I'm in room_1 and in front of blue_door_2.

Step 5: "toggle blue_door_2"
- I'm in room_1, in front of blue_door_2, and blue_door_2 is unlocked.

Step 6: "gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_2"
- I'm in room_3 and blue_door_2 is unlocked.

Step 7: "gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4"
- I'm in room_3 and in front of green_door_1.

Step 8: "toggle green_door_1"
- I'm in room_3, in front of green_door_1, and green_door_1 is unlocked.

Step 9: "gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_1"
- I'm in room_4 and green_door_1 is unlocked.

Step 10: "gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4"
- I'm in room_4 and in front of purple_ball_1.

This plan achieves the goal and satisfies all constraints. The goal is to be in room_4, in front of purple_ball_1, which is achieved by Step 10. All constraints are met: I'm in front of green_door_1 at Step 7, I'm in room_4 at Steps 9 and 10, I'm in room_1 at Steps 3-5 before being in room_4, and blue_door_3 remains locked throughout.

'''
1. "gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1"
2. "toggle blue_door_1"
3. "gotoroom room_2 room_1 blue_door_1"
4. "gotodoor blue_door_2 room_1 room_3"
5. "toggle blue_door_2"
6. "gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_2"
7. "gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4"
8. "toggle green_door_1"
9. "gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_1"
10. "gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4"
'''

This is an optimal plan, meaning there's no shorter plan that achieves the goal while satisfying all constraints.
