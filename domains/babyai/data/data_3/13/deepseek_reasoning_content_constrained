Okay, let me try to figure out how to solve this planning problem. So the goal is to have a purple ball in room_4, be in room_4, and be in front of that ball. The constraints are that at some point I must be in front of green_door_1, and every time I'm in room_4, I must have been in room_1 or holding the purple_ball_1 before. Also, blue_door_3 must stay locked all the time.

Starting in room_2. The purple_ball_1 is already in room_4, so maybe I just need to get there. But all doors are locked initially. The green_door_1 connects room_3 and 4. Blue doors 1, 2, 3 are locked. So I need to unlock some doors. But the constraint says blue_door_3 must stay locked, so I can't use that. So the path from room_2 to room_4 via blue_door_3 is blocked. So how else can I get to room_4?

Possible paths: From room_2, maybe go to room_1 via blue_door_1 (but it's locked), then from room_1 to room_3 via blue_door_2 (also locked), then from room_3 to room_4 via green_door_1 (locked). So all doors are locked. So I need to unlock some doors. But the toggle action requires being in front of the door. To get in front of a door, I need to be in a room connected by that door and the position in front of it isn't blocked.

Looking at initial objects: In room_2, there are grey_box_2 and grey_box_3. Maybe they are blocking doors? Wait, the initial state doesn't mention any objects blocking doors. The preconditions for "goto door" require that there's no object blocking the position in front of the door in the current room. So if in room_2, the doors connected are blue_door_1 (to room_1) and blue_door_3 (to room_4). So to go to blue_door_1 from room_2, check if there's any object blocking it. The initial state in room_2 has grey_box_2 and grey_box_3. But where are they placed? The problem doesn't specify their positions, so maybe they're not blocking the doors. So I can assume that the doors aren't blocked by objects. Wait, the problem statement says that the effect of picking up an object x is that if x was blocking a door, then it's no longer blocking. But the initial state doesn't mention any doors being blocked. So maybe none of the doors are blocked initially. So in room_2, I can go to blue_door_1 and blue_door_3.

But blue_door_3 must stay locked. So even if I unlock it, I can't use it. Wait, the constraint says blue_door_3 must be locked in every state. So I can't toggle it. Because if I do, it would unlock, but then the next state would have it unlocked, violating the constraint. Therefore, blue_door_3 must remain locked throughout. So I can't use that door. So the only way to get to room_4 is via room_3 and green_door_1. But green_door_1 is locked. So I need to unlock it. To unlock green_door_1, I need to be in front of it. To get in front of green_door_1, I need to be in room_3 or room_4. Let's see. The door connects room_3 and room_4. So if I'm in room_3, I can go to green_door_1. But how to get to room_3?

Starting in room_2. The doors from room_2 are blue_door_1 (to room_1, locked) and blue_door_3 (to room4, locked, can't use). So maybe I need to go to room_1 via blue_door_1. But blue_door_1 is locked. So I need to unlock it. To unlock blue_door_1, I need to be in front of it. To get in front of blue_door_1, I need to be in room_2 or room_1. Since I'm in room_2, I can go to blue_door_1. Then toggle it to unlock. Then go to room_1. From room_1, doors are blue_door_1 (now unlocked) and blue_door_2 (to room3, locked). Then I need to unlock blue_door_2. So go to blue_door_2 from room_1, toggle it, then go to room_3. Then in room_3, go to green_door_1, toggle it to unlock, then go to room_4. Once in room_4, go to the purple_ball_1 and be in front of it.

But wait, the purple_ball_1 is already in room_4. So the goal is to be in room_4, in front of it. So maybe the plan is:

1. From room_2, go to blue_door_1 (room_2 side), toggle it to unlock.
2. Go through blue_door_1 to room_1.
3. From room_1, go to blue_door_2 (room_1 side), toggle to unlock.
4. Go through blue_door_2 to room_3.
5. In room_3, go to green_door_1 (room_3 side), toggle to unlock.
6. Go through green_door_1 to room_4.
7. Go to purple_ball_1 in room_4.

But wait, the constraints require that when I'm in room_4, I must have been in room_1 or holding the purple_ball_1 before. In this plan, when entering room_4, the previous state was room_3, which isn't room_1. But since I was in room_1 earlier (step 2), maybe that satisfies the condition. Because the constraint says that if I'm in room_4 in some state, there must be an earlier state where I was in room_1 or holding the purple_ball_1. So after step 2, I was in room_1. Then later, when I reach room_4 (step 6), the earlier state (step 2) satisfies the condition. So that's okay.

Also, the constraint says I must be in front of green_door_1 at some state. That happens when I toggle it in room_3 (step 5).

Another constraint is that blue_door_3 must remain locked. Since I never interact with blue_door_3, it stays locked as per initial state. So that's okay.

But let's check the steps:

- Start in room_2.
- Action: gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1. Precondition: in a room connected by blue_door_1 (room_2 is connected), and no object blocking. Assuming no objects are blocking, this is possible.
- Toggle blue_door_1. Now it's unlocked.
- Gotoroom room_2 room_1 blue_door_1. Now in room_1.
- Then, gotodoor blue_door_2 room_1 room_3. Precondition: in room_1, which is connected, and no blocking. Toggle blue_door_2 to unlock.
- Gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_2. Now in room_3.
- Gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4. Preconditions met. Toggle to unlock.
- Gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_1. Now in room_4.
- Then gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4. Then the goal is achieved.

Wait, but when entering room_4, the agent is no longer in front of any object. So need to then go to the purple_ball_1.

So the steps would be:

1. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1
2. toggle blue_door_1
3. gotoroom room_2 room_1 blue_door_1
4. gotodoor blue_door_2 room_1 room_3
5. toggle blue_door_2
6. gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_2
7. gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4
8. toggle green_door_1
9. gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_1
10. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4

But let's check if all constraints are met:

- Must be in front of green_door_1 at some point: step 7 and 8, yes.
- Every state where in room_4 (steps 9 and 10) must have had a prior state in room_1 (step 3) or holding purple_ball_1 (not here). Since step 3 is before step 9, that's okay.
- blue_door_3 remains locked always: yes, we never touch it.

Also, the goal is to have a purple ball (v) in room_4, which is already the case. The agent just needs to be in room_4 and in front of it.

But wait, when you drop into room_4 via green_door_1, you are in room_4 but not in front of any object. So need to use 'gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4' which requires being in the same room as the object. Since purple_ball_1 is in room_4, that's okay.

So the plan seems valid. But let's check if there's a shorter path. For example, can we avoid going to room_1? Let's see.

Alternative path: From room_2, can't go to room_4 via blue_door_3 because it's locked and must stay locked. So must go through room_1 and room_3. So the steps I outlined earlier are necessary. Is there a shorter way?

Alternatively, maybe pick up an object in room_2, but the goal doesn't require moving objects. The purple_ball_1 is already in room_4, so maybe that's the only ball needed. So the plan is as above.

Another check: when toggling doors, do I need to be in front of them? Yes. So each time, before toggling, I need to 'gotodoor' first.

Yes, in the steps, before each toggle, the agent does a gotodoor to be in front of it.

So the plan is valid and meets all constraints. Let's count the steps: 10 actions. Is there a way to reduce the number?

Wait, after step 3 (gotoroom to room_1), step 4 is gotodoor blue_door_2 room_1 room_3. Then toggle. Then gotoroom to room_3. Then gotodoor green_door_1, toggle, gotoroom to room4, then gotoobject. So total 10 steps. I don't think it can be shorter. Because each door needs to be unlocked, which requires two actions per door (goto and toggle), and moving through each door. So three doors: blue_door_1, blue_door_2, green_door_1. Each takes two actions (goto and toggle) but wait, no: for blue_door_1, it's in room_2. So gotodoor, toggle, gotoroom. Then in room_1, gotodoor blue_door_2, toggle, gotoroom. Then in room3, gotodoor green_door_1, toggle, gotoroom. Then gotoobject. So that's 3 doors, each requiring gotodoor (1), toggle (2), gotoroom (3). Then the final gotoobject. So 3*3 (goto, toggle, gotoroom) = 9 steps, plus the final gotoobject, total 10. Hmm.

Wait, for each door, the steps are:

1. gotodoor (1 action)
2. toggle (1)
3. gotoroom (1)
That's 3 actions per door. For three doors, 3*3=9, plus the final gotoobject makes 10. But perhaps there's a way to optimize. Let's see.

Wait, the doors are blue_door_1 (room_2 to room_1), blue_door_2 (room_1 to room_3), green_door_1 (room_3 to room4). So three doors, each requiring unlock. So the steps are necessary. So the plan length is 10. I don't think you can do it shorter.

But wait, maybe after unlocking blue_door_1, when moving to room_1, the agent is already in room_1. Then when going to blue_door_2, they need to go to the door, toggle, then move. So that's 3 actions for each door.

Yes. So the plan seems optimal.
