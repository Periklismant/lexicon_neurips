Alright, let's understand the problem:

I am an agent in a 2D gridworld with 4 rooms arranged in a square formation. I need to find a valid sequence of actions to solve the given planning problem while satisfying all given constraints.

Let me first understand the initial state:
1. I am in room_2.
2. Objects in room_1: grey_ball_1
3. Objects in room_2: yellow_box_1, grey_ball_2, purple_ball_1
4. Objects in room_3: grey_box_1, green_ball_1
5. Objects in room_4: yellow_ball_1, yellow_box_2
6. All doors (yellow_door_1, blue_door_1, yellow_door_2, yellow_door_3) are locked.
7. yellow_door_1 connects room_1 and room_2.
8. blue_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3.
9. yellow_door_2 connects room_2 and room_4.
10. yellow_door_3 connects room_3 and room_4.
11. I have visited room_2.
12. I am not holding any object.

And my goal is:
"There is a door d such that "The following conditions are all true: "d is blue", "room_1 and room_3 are connected via d", "you are in front of d", "d is not locked"""

So, I need to be in front of the unlocked blue_door_1, which connects room_1 and room_3.

Constraints:
1. "blue_door_1 is locked" must hold in at least one state.
2. If "blue_door_1 is locked" holds in some state s, then "you are in front of grey_ball_2" must hold at s or at some state after s.
3. "you are holding some object" must hold in at least one state.
4. "you are not in room_1" must hold in every state.

Given the constraints, I need to ensure:
1. I never enter room_1 at any point.
2. I need to go in front of grey_ball_2 after blue_door_1 is locked (which it initially is).
3. I need to pick up at least one object during the plan.

Now, let me devise a plan. My goal is to reach blue_door_1 from the side of room_3 (since I can't enter room_1) and unlock it.

Initial State:
I am in room_2, all doors are locked, and grey_ball_2 is in room_2.

Given the goal and constraints, I think the following plan would work:

1. First, let's go in front of grey_ball_2 since blue_door_1 is initially locked.
2. Go in front of yellow_door_2, which connects room_2 and room_4.
3. Unlock yellow_door_2.
4. Go to room_4 from room_2 via yellow_door_2.
5. Go in front of yellow_door_3, which connects room_4 and room_3.
6. Unlock yellow_door_3.
7. Go to room_3 from room_4 via yellow_door_3.
8. Now that I'm in room_3, I can go in front of blue_door_1.
9. Unlock blue_door_1.

But I also need to hold at least one object. Let's include that in the plan.

Actually, I realize there's a constraint that states "you are holding some object" must hold in at least one state. This means that I need to pick up an object at some point.

Let's adjust the plan:

1. First, let's go in front of grey_ball_2 since blue_door_1 is initially locked. This satisfies the constraint regarding "you are in front of grey_ball_2".
2. Now, let's pick up grey_ball_2 to satisfy the constraint regarding "you are holding some object". Of course, I can pick any other object in room_2 as well, like yellow_box_1 or purple_ball_1. For now, let's go with grey_ball_2.
3. Go to an empty position in room_2.
4. Drop grey_ball_2 to free my hands.
5. Go in front of yellow_door_2, which connects room_2 and room_4.
6. Unlock yellow_door_2.
7. Go to room_4 from room_2 via yellow_door_2.
8. Go in front of yellow_door_3, which connects room_4 and room_3.
9. Unlock yellow_door_3.
10. Go to room_3 from room_4 via yellow_door_3.
11. Now that I'm in room_3, I can go in front of blue_door_1.
12. Unlock blue_door_1.

Now, let's go through the steps using the formal action names:

Actually, a slight correction. Let's formulate the exact plan step-by-step with the allowed actions:

1. go to grey_ball_2 in room_2: "gotoobject grey_ball_2 room_2"
2. pick grey_ball_2 in room_2: "pick grey_ball_2 room_2"
3. go to an empty position: "gotoempty"
4. drop grey_ball_2 in room_2: "drop grey_ball_2 room_2"
5. go to yellow_door_2 that connects room_2 and room_4: "gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_2 room_4"
6. toggle yellow_door_2: "toggle yellow_door_2"
7. go to room_4 from room_2 via yellow_door_2: "gotoroom room_2 room_4 yellow_door_2"
8. go to yellow_door_3 that connects room_4 and room_3: "gotodoor yellow_door_3 room_4 room_3"
9. toggle yellow_door_3: "toggle yellow_door_3"
10. go to room_3 from room_4 via yellow_door_3: "gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_3"
11. go to blue_door_1 that connects room_3 and room_1: "gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_1"
12. toggle blue_door_1: "toggle blue_door_1"

Let's review this plan:

- The constraint "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'blue_door_1 is locked'" is satisfied since blue_door_1 is initially locked. 
- The constraint "If expression 'blue_door_1 is locked' holds in some state s, then expression 'you are in front of grey_ball_2' must hold at s or at some state after s" is satisfied since I go in front of grey_ball_2 in the first step.
- The constraint "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'you are holding some object'" is satisfied as I pick grey_ball_2 in the second step.
- The constraint "The following expression must hold in every state: 'you are not in room_1'" is satisfied as I never enter room_1 in any step of the plan.

The goal "There is a door d such that 'The following conditions are all true: 'd is blue', 'room_1 and room_3 are connected via d', 'you are in front of d', 'd is not locked'" is achieved as blue_door_1 is blue, connects room_1 and room_3, and I'm in front of it and it's not locked at the end of the plan.

Is this plan valid? Let's check the preconditions for each action:

1. "gotoobject grey_ball_2 room_2": I'm already in room_2, so this is valid.
2. "pick grey_ball_2 room_2": I'm now in front of grey_ball_2 and my hands are empty, so this is valid.
3. "gotoempty": I can go to an empty position at any time, so this is valid.
4. "drop grey_ball_2 room_2": I'm holding grey_ball_2 and in front of an empty position, so this is valid.
5. "gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_2 room_4": I'm in room_2 and yellow_door_2 connects room_2 and room_4, and there's no object blocking the door, so this is valid.
6. "toggle yellow_door_2": I'm in front of yellow_door_2, so this is valid.
7. "gotoroom room_2 room_4 yellow_door_2": I'm in room_2, adjacent to room_4, and yellow_door_2 that connects them is now unlocked, so this is valid.
8. "gotodoor yellow_door_3 room_4 room_3": I'm now in room_4, and yellow_door_3 connects room_4 and room_3, and there's no object blocking the door, so this is valid.
9. "toggle yellow_door_3": I'm in front of yellow_door_3, so this is valid.
10. "gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_3": I'm in room_4, adjacent to room_3, and yellow_door_3 that connects them is now unlocked, so this is valid.
11. "gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_1": I'm now in room_3, and blue_door_1 connects room_3 and room_1, and there's no object blocking the door, so this is valid.
12. "toggle blue_door_1": I'm in front of blue_door_1, so this is valid.

This plan should successfully achieve the goal while satisfying all the constraints.

Let me double-check the constraints one more time:

1. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'blue_door_1 is locked'": This is true at the beginning of the plan.
2. "If expression 'blue_door_1 is locked' holds in some state s, then expression 'you are in front of grey_ball_2' must hold at s or at some state after s": This constraint says that after blue_door_1 is found to be locked, I need to go in front of grey_ball_2 in the future. I do this in the first step. So, all good.
3. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'you are holding some object'": This is true when I'm holding grey_ball_2.
4. "The following expression must hold in every state: 'you are not in room_1'": This is true because I never enter room_1.

My goal is to be in front of the blue_door_1 which is unlocked, and I reach this at the end of the plan, so the goal is also satisfied.

Therefore, the plan is:

```
gotoobject grey_ball_2 room_2
pick grey_ball_2 room_2
gotoempty
drop grey_ball_2 room_2
gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_2 room_4
toggle yellow_door_2
gotoroom room_2 room_4 yellow_door_2
gotodoor yellow_door_3 room_4 room_3
toggle yellow_door_3
gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_3
gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_1
toggle blue_door_1
```

Let me make sure that the goal is satisfied. The goal is:
"There is a door d such that "The following conditions are all true: "d is blue", "room_1 and room_3 are connected via d", "you are in front of d", "d is not locked"""

At the end of the plan, I am in front of blue_door_1, which is indeed blue, connects room_1 and room_3, and is not locked (I unlocked it). So, the goal is satisfied.

I think this is an optimal plan to achieve the goal while satisfying all constraints. But let me see if there's a way to simplify this:

Actually, I think I can skip steps 3 and 4 (going to an empty position and dropping the ball). I don't need to drop the ball if I can carry it with me. Let's adjust the plan:

1. go to grey_ball_2 in room_2: "gotoobject grey_ball_2 room_2"
2. pick grey_ball_2 in room_2: "pick grey_ball_2 room_2"
3. go to yellow_door_2 that connects room_2 and room_4: "gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_2 room_4"
4. toggle yellow_door_2: "toggle yellow_door_2"
5. go to room_4 from room_2 via yellow_door_2: "gotoroom room_2 room_4 yellow_door_2"
6. go to yellow_door_3 that connects room_4 and room_3: "gotodoor yellow_door_3 room_4 room_3"
7. toggle yellow_door_3: "toggle yellow_door_3"
8. go to room_3 from room_4 via yellow_door_3: "gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_3"
9. drop grey_ball_2 in room_3: "drop grey_ball_2 room_3"
10. go to blue_door_1 that connects room_3 and room_1: "gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_1"
11. toggle blue_door_1: "toggle blue_door_1"

Actually, the action "drop grey_ball_2 room_3" requires the position in front of me to be empty. Let's see if there's actually an empty position I can use.

On second thought, I don't actually need to drop the ball. I can just toggle the door while still holding the ball because the toggle action doesn't have a precondition about having empty hands. So, I can just maintain the ball throughout the plan and still achieve the goal. But I'd need to write to "gotoempty" before dropping to make sure I drop in an empty location. So, let's adjust:

1. go to grey_ball_2 in room_2: "gotoobject grey_ball_2 room_2"
2. pick grey_ball_2 in room_2: "pick grey_ball_2 room_2"
3. go to yellow_door_2 that connects room_2 and room_4: "gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_2 room_4"
4. toggle yellow_door_2: "toggle yellow_door_2"
5. go to room_4 from room_2 via yellow_door_2: "gotoroom room_2 room_4 yellow_door_2"
6. go to yellow_door_3 that connects room_4 and room_3: "gotodoor yellow_door_3 room_4 room_3"
7. toggle yellow_door_3: "toggle yellow_door_3"
8. go to room_3 from room_4 via yellow_door_3: "gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_3"
9. go to empty position in room_3: "gotoempty"
10. drop grey_ball_2 in room_3: "drop grey_ball_2 room_3"
11. go to blue_door_1 that connects room_3 and room_1: "gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_1"
12. toggle blue_door_1: "toggle blue_door_1"

But let me also check if I can toggle a door while holding an object. If there's no precondition that says a door can only be toggled with empty hands, I think I can just toggle while holding the ball. This would lead to this plan:

1. go to grey_ball_2 in room_2: "gotoobject grey_ball_2 room_2"
2. pick grey_ball_2 in room_2: "pick grey_ball_2 room_2"
3. go to yellow_door_2 that connects room_2 and room_4: "gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_2 room_4"
4. toggle yellow_door_2: "toggle yellow_door_2"
5. go to room_4 from room_2 via yellow_door_2: "gotoroom room_2 room_4 yellow_door_2"
6. go to yellow_door_3 that connects room_4 and room_3: "gotodoor yellow_door_3 room_4 room_3"
7. toggle yellow_door_3: "toggle yellow_door_3"
8. go to room_3 from room_4 via yellow_door_3: "gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_3"
9. go to blue_door_1 that connects room_3 and room_1: "gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_1"
10. toggle blue_door_1: "toggle blue_door_1"

Actually, let's check the precondition for "toggle" action again. It states: "you may only toggle a door d if you are in front of d." There's no mention of having empty hands. So, I can toggle a door while still holding an object. Let's use this plan as it seems to be the shortest valid one.

But wait, the goal tells us I need to be in front of the blue door, blue_door_1, and the door should be unlocked. I am achieving this at the end of my plan. Let's double-check.

But actually, the goal states "There is a door d such that "The following conditions are all true: "d is blue", "room_1 and room_3 are connected via d", "you are in front of d", "d is not locked"""

The original constraints state the following:
1. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'blue_door_1 is locked'": This is already true at the beginning.
2. "If expression 'blue_door_1 is locked' holds in some state s, then expression 'you are in front of grey_ball_2' must hold at s or at some state after s": I'll go in front of grey_ball_2, so this is taken care of.
3. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'you are holding some object'": I'll pick up grey_ball_2, so this is satisfied.
4. "The following expression must hold in every state: 'you are not in room_1'": I never enter room_1, so this is satisfied.

If I carry grey_ball_2 with me throughout the plan, I'll satisfy the goal, which says I need to be in front of an unlocked blue door connecting room_1 and room_3.

Let's finalize the plan:

```
gotoobject grey_ball_2 room_2
pick grey_ball_2 room_2
gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_2 room_4
toggle yellow_door_2
gotoroom room_2 room_4 yellow_door_2
gotodoor yellow_door_3 room_4 room_3
toggle yellow_door_3
gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_3
gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_1
toggle blue_door_1
```

This should achieve the goal while satisfying all constraints.

Actually, I want to be careful about checking whether being in front of a door satisfies "you are in front of grey_ball_2". Reading the preconditions for the "goto object" action, it says: "goto object: you may only go in front of an object x if you are in the same room as x." This implies that an object is distinct from a door. So, to ensure I fulfill the constraint, I indeed need to go in front of grey_ball_2 after blue_door_1 is found to be locked.

The constraint says that after blue_door_1 is found to be locked (which is true in the initial state), I should at some point be in front of grey_ball_2. This is satisfied by going to grey_ball_2 in the first step of the plan.

Now, one more check: The goal says I need to be in front of blue_door_1 when it's unlocked. I achieve this in the last step of my revised plan, so the goal is satisfied.

I'm confident that this plan is valid, achieves the goal, and satisfies all constraints.

```
gotoobject grey_ball_2 room_2
pick grey_ball_2 room_2
gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_2 room_4
toggle yellow_door_2
gotoroom room_2 room_4 yellow_door_2
gotodoor yellow_door_3 room_4 room_3
toggle yellow_door_3
gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_3
gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_1
toggle blue_door_1
```
