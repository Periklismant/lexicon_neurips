Okay, let's see. The goal is to have a blue door d connecting room_1 and room_3, be in front of it, and have it unlocked. Also, there are some constraints. Hmm.

First, looking at the initial state. The blue_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3, right? But it's locked initially. So we need to unlock it. But the problem says that in the final state, d (which must be blue_door_1) should not be locked. So we need to toggle it. But to toggle a door, you have to be in front of it. However, the constraints say that in every state, the agent cannot be in room_1. So we can't go to room_1. So how do we get to blue_door_1? Because blue_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3. So if the agent is in room_3, can they go to the door?

Wait, the agent starts in room_2. Let's see the connections. The doors are:

- yellow_door_1 connects room_1 and room_2.
- blue_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3.
- yellow_door_2 connects room_2 and room_4.
- yellow_door_3 connects room_3 and room_4.

All doors are locked initially. The agent is in room_2. To get to blue_door_1, they need to go to room_3, but how? Because room_3 is connected to room_1 via blue_door_1 (which is locked) and to room_4 via yellow_door_3 (which is also locked). Hmm. Wait, the initial state says all doors are locked: yellow_door_1, blue_door_1, yellow_door_2, yellow_door_3.

So starting in room_2, the agent can't go to room_1 via yellow_door_1 (locked), but they can't go to room_4 via yellow_door_2 (also locked). So the agent is stuck in room_2 unless they can unlock a door. But to unlock a door, they need to be in front of it, which requires going to the door's location. But the doors in room_2 are yellow_door_1 (connects to room_1) and yellow_door_2 (connects to room_4). Both are locked. So to get to a door, maybe the agent has to go in front of one of those doors in room_2. But those doors are blocked if there's an object in front of them. Wait, the preconditions for "gotodoor" are that you are in a room connected by the door, and there's no object blocking the position in front of the door in your current room.

So, in room_2, what objects are present? yellow_box_1, grey_ball_2, purple_ball_1. The doors in room_2 are yellow_door_1 and yellow_door_2. Are any of these doors blocked by objects? The problem statement says that objects can block the position in front of a door. So if there's an object in front of the door, you can't go there. Let me check the initial state. The initial state mentions where the objects are. For example, yellow_box_1 is in room_2. If the yellow_box_1 is in front of a door, then the agent can't go to that door. But the problem doesn't specify where exactly the objects are positioned in the room. So assuming that unless stated otherwise, objects are not blocking the doors. So maybe the agent can go to the doors in room_2.

Wait, but the problem might not specify the exact positions. The preconditions for "gotodoor" require that there's no object blocking the position in front of the door in the current room. So if there's any object in the room that's blocking that door's front position, you can't go there. But since the initial state doesn't mention any blocking, maybe we can assume that the doors are not blocked. So the agent can go to the doors in their current room.

So, the agent is in room_2. Let's see the possible actions. They need to unlock blue_door_1, but they can't go to room_1. So how to reach blue_door_1? Blue_door_1 is between room_1 and room_3. Since the agent can't enter room_1, they need to approach blue_door_1 from room_3. But how to get to room_3?

Room_3 is connected to room_1 via blue_door_1 (locked) and to room_4 via yellow_door_3 (locked). So to get to room_3, maybe from room_4. But how to get to room_4? Room_4 is connected to room_2 via yellow_door_2 (locked) and to room_3 via yellow_door_3 (locked). So the agent needs to unlock one of the doors.

Wait, but the agent is in room_2. Let's look at the doors in room_2: yellow_door_1 (to room_1, locked) and yellow_door_2 (to room_4, locked). If the agent can unlock one of these doors, they can move to another room.

But to unlock a door, they need to toggle it, which requires being in front of it. So, the agent can try to go to a door in room_2, toggle it to unlock, then go through.

But which door? Let's think about the path. The goal is to be in front of blue_door_1 (in room_3) and have it unlocked. So perhaps the agent needs to go from room_2 to room_4 via yellow_door_2 once it's unlocked, then from room_4 to room_3 via yellow_door_3 (if unlocked), then go to blue_door_1 in room_3, toggle it to unlock, but wait, blue_door_1 is already locked. Wait, the final goal is that blue_door_1 is unlocked. So if the agent can reach room_3, then go to blue_door_1 (from room_3) and toggle it, unlocking it.

But how to get to room_3? Let's see:

Possible path: room_2 → room_4 via yellow_door_2 (need to unlock it). Then room_4 → room_3 via yellow_door_3 (need to unlock it). Then in room_3, go to blue_door_1 (but that's in room_3 and room_1). But the agent can't be in room_1, but they can be in room_3. So in room_3, the blue_door_1 is connected to room_1. The agent can be in front of blue_door_1 from room_3's side. Then toggle it to unlock.

So steps would be:

1. Unlock yellow_door_2 in room_2 (requires being in front of it)
2. Go through yellow_door_2 to room_4
3. Unlock yellow_door_3 in room_4 (needs to be in front of it)
4. Go through yellow_door_3 to room_3
5. In room_3, go to blue_door_1 (which connects to room_1)
6. Toggle blue_door_1 to unlock it

But wait, the initial state says all doors are locked, including blue_door_1. So the agent can unlock it once they are in front of it in room_3. Then, after toggling, blue_door_1 becomes unlocked, which meets the goal.

But the problem also has constraints:

- The blue_door_1 must be locked in at least one state. Well, initially it's locked. So that's covered.

- If blue_door_1 is locked in some state, then in that state or a subsequent one, the agent must be in front of grey_ball_2. Since blue_door_1 is initially locked, the first constraint is satisfied. But the second part says that if in any state s where blue_door_1 is locked, then in s or a later state, the agent is in front of grey_ball_2.

Wait, blue_door_1 starts locked, so the initial state is a state where blue_door_1 is locked. Therefore, the agent must be in front of grey_ball_2 at some point in that state or after. So the plan must include an action where the agent is in front of grey_ball_2, either in the initial state (but they start in room_2, grey_ball_2 is in room_2) but not necessarily in front of it. So they need to perform a 'gotoobject grey_ball_2 room_2' at some point.

Another constraint: the agent must hold some object in at least one state. So they need to pick up something.

Also, in every state, the agent is not in room_1. So any action that would move them to room_1 is invalid. So they can't go through yellow_door_1 to room_1.

So putting it all together:

Steps needed:

- The agent starts in room_2. Need to unlock doors to move towards room_3.

Plan outline:

1. Go to yellow_door_2 in room_2 (gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_2 room_4)
   Preconditions: in room_2, door connects to room_4, and no object blocking. Since initial state has yellow_box_1 and others in room_2, but not blocking the door, assuming this is possible.

2. Toggle yellow_door_2 to unlock it.

3. Go through yellow_door_2 to room_4 (gotoroom room_2 room_4 yellow_door_2)

4. In room_4, go to yellow_door_3 (gotodoor yellow_door_3 room_4 room_3)

5. Toggle yellow_door_3 to unlock it.

6. Go through yellow_door_3 to room_3.

7. In room_3, go to blue_door_1 (gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_1)

8. Toggle blue_door_1 to unlock it.

Now, the goal requires being in front of blue_door_1 (which is done in step 7), and the door is unlocked (step 8). But after step 8, the door is unlocked, but the agent is still in front of it.

But the agent also needs to satisfy the constraint of having held an object. So they need to pick up and drop an object at some point. Also, the constraint about blue_door_1 being locked in some state is already satisfied in the initial state, so the other constraint is that whenever blue_door_1 is locked (which it is until step 8), the agent must be in front of grey_ball_2 in that state or after.

Since the agent starts in room_2, and grey_ball_2 is in room_2, perhaps they need to go to grey_ball_2 before moving towards the doors.

But when? Because once they leave room_2, they can't come back (if they can't go through room_1). Wait, after unlocking yellow_door_2, they go to room_4. From room_4, they can go back to room_2 through yellow_door_2 if needed. But the constraint is that in any state where blue_door_1 is locked (which is until step 8), the agent must be in front of grey_ball_2 in that state or after. So the agent needs to be in front of grey_ball_2 at least once, either before or after any state where blue_door_1 is locked.

Since blue_door_1 is unlocked in step 8, all prior states have blue_door_1 locked. So the agent must be in front of grey_ball_2 at least once in the plan.

So the plan needs to include going to grey_ball_2 in room_2. Let's insert that:

So steps:

1. Go to grey_ball_2 in room_2 (gotoobject grey_ball_2 room_2)
   This ensures that the agent is in front of grey_ball_2 in some state (state after step 1). Since blue_door_1 is locked in all states until step 8, this satisfies the constraint.

2. Then proceed to unlock doors as before.

But then, the agent also needs to hold some object at some point. So perhaps after step 1, they can pick up grey_ball_2, then drop it again.

But dropping requires being in front of an empty position. So after picking up, they need to go to empty, then drop.

But how does this fit into the plan? Let's see:

After step 1 (gotoobject grey_ball_2 room_2), the agent can pick it up (pick grey_ball_2 room_2), then perhaps drop it (gotoempty, then drop). But maybe it's better to pick it up and carry it through the doors, but then when moving through doors, the agent can't be holding an object? Wait, no, moving through doors doesn't require being empty-handed. The preconditions for gotoroom are: in adjacent room, door unlocked. The fact that you're holding something doesn't affect that. So the agent can hold an object while moving through doors.

So perhaps:

1. gotoobject grey_ball_2 room_2

2. pick grey_ball_2 room_2 (now holding it, satisfying the "must hold some object" constraint)

3. Then proceed to unlock doors as before, carrying the grey_ball_2. But then when they need to toggle doors, they need to be in front of them, but holding the ball. The toggle action's preconditions don't require being empty-handed. So that's okay.

But then, they need to drop the ball at some point, but maybe it's okay to carry it until the end. However, the drop action's preconditions are that you are holding the object and the position in front is empty. So unless the agent goes to an empty spot, they can't drop. But maybe they don't need to drop it. The constraint is that in at least one state, the agent is holding an object. Picking it up in step 2 satisfies that. So even if they hold it until the end, that's okay.

But wait, the plan needs to be optimal, i.e., as short as possible. Adding steps to pick and then drop would make it longer. So maybe the minimal plan is to pick up the grey_ball_2, carry it through the steps, and then drop it when necessary, but perhaps it's not needed. Let's see.

Wait, the plan steps so far would be:

1. gotoobject grey_ball_2 room_2

2. pick grey_ball_2 room_2 (satisfies "hold some object")

3. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_2 room_4

4. toggle yellow_door_2 (unlock it)

5. gotoroom room_2 room_4 yellow_door_2

6. gotodoor yellow_door_3 room_4 room_3

7. toggle yellow_door_3 (unlock it)

8. gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_3

9. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_1

10. toggle blue_door_1 (unlock it)

But step 9: gotodoor blue_door_1 in room_3. Then step 10 toggles it. Now, the agent is in front of blue_door_1, which is now unlocked. So the goal is achieved: there exists a door d (blue_door_1) that is blue, connects room_1 and room_3, agent is in front of it, and it's not locked.

But the constraints:

- The agent must not be in room_1 at any state. Correct, since the agent is in room_3 here.

- At least one state has "blue_door_1 is locked". Initially, yes, and until step 10, it's locked. So that's covered.

- If in any state where blue_door_1 is locked, then agent is in front of grey_ball_2 in that state or later. The agent is in front of grey_ball_2 in step 1, which is before unlocking yellow_door_2. Since blue_door_1 is locked in all states up to step 10, step 1 satisfies the condition for all those states.

- Must hold some object: step 2 picks up the ball, so that's covered.

So this plan would work, but let's count the steps. From 1 to 10, that's 10 actions. But maybe there's a shorter path.

Wait, after step 1 (gotoobject grey_ball_2), step 2 (pick it up), then step 3 (goto yellow_door_2), then toggle, then move to room_4, then goto yellow_door_3, toggle, move to room_3, goto blue_door_1, toggle.

That's 10 steps. But perhaps there's a way to avoid carrying the ball. For example, after picking up the ball, drop it immediately. But that would require two more steps (gotoempty and drop). So that's adding steps. So the initial plan of carrying the ball is better.

Alternatively, maybe the agent can go to the door first, toggle it, then go to the grey_ball_2. Wait, but then the agent has to ensure that after any state where blue_door_1 is locked (which is until step 10), they have been in front of grey_ball_2. If they first unlock doors and then go to grey_ball_2, but if blue_door_1 is still locked at that point, then it's okay. But once they unlock blue_door_1 (step 10), then after that, blue_door_1 is unlocked, but before that, all steps have blue_door_1 locked. So the agent must be in front of grey_ball_2 at some point before step 10.

But if the agent goes to grey_ball_2 after some steps, but before step 10, that's okay. For example, suppose they unlock doors to get to room_4, then return to room_2, go to grey_ball_2, then proceed. But that would add steps. So perhaps the initial plan is better.

But let's check if all preconditions are met in each step.

Step 1: gotoobject grey_ball_2 room_2. Precondition: agent is in room_2 (yes), and grey_ball_2 is in room_2 (yes). So valid.

Step 2: pick grey_ball_2 room_2. Preconditions: in same room (yes), not holding anything (yes). So valid. After this, agent is holding grey_ball_2.

Step 3: gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_2 room_4. Preconditions: in room_2 (yes), which is connected via yellow_door_2 to room_4. And no object blocking front of door in room_2. Assuming no blocking, valid.

Step 4: toggle yellow_door_2. Precondition: in front of yellow_door_2 (after step 3, yes). Toggle unlocks it.

Step 5: gotoroom room_2 room_4 yellow_door_2. Preconditions: in room_2 (yes), adjacent to room_4 (yes via yellow_door_2), door is unlocked (now yes after step 4). So valid. Now agent is in room_4.

Step 6: gotodoor yellow_door_3 room_4 room_3. Preconditions: in room_4 (yes), door connects to room_3. No blocking objects. Valid.

Step 7: toggle yellow_door_3. Pre: in front of it. Unlocks it.

Step 8: gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_3. Pre: in room_4, adjacent via yellow_door_3 (unlocked now). Valid. Now in room_3.

Step 9: gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_1. Pre: in room_3 (yes), door connects room_3 and room_1. No blocking. Valid.

Step 10: toggle blue_door_1. Pre: in front of it. Toggle to unlock. Now, blue_door_1 is unlocked. The agent is in front of blue_door_1 in room_3. So the goal is achieved.

So this plan has 10 steps. But maybe there's a shorter way.

Wait, after step 5 (agent is in room_4), step 6 is gotodoor yellow_door_3. Then toggle, then go to room_3. Then goto blue_door_1 and toggle. That's correct.

But let's think: do we need to pick up the grey_ball_2? Because the constraint is that the agent must hold some object in at least one state. So picking it up once is sufficient. So steps 1 and 2 are necessary. But if we can combine steps, maybe not. But I don't think so. The agent must go to grey_ball_2, then pick it up.

Alternatively, can the agent go to the door first, then toggle it, but then how to satisfy the constraint about being in front of grey_ball_2?

Wait, if the agent first unlocks yellow_door_2, moves to room_4, but then can't return to room_2 (if they don't unlock the door again). Wait, when they unlock yellow_door_2 in step 4, it's now unlocked. So after moving to room_4, they can come back to room_2 through yellow_door_2. So perhaps after unlocking yellow_door_2 and yellow_door_3, the agent can go back to room_2 to pick up the ball, but that would add steps. However, the initial plan already picks up the ball early, which might be more efficient.

Another thing: when the agent is in room_2 and picks up grey_ball_2, the grey_ball_2 is no longer in room_2 (as per the effect of pick). But the constraint says that in any state where blue_door_1 is locked (which is until step 10), the agent must be in front of grey_ball_2. But after step 2, the agent is holding grey_ball_2, so grey_ball_2 is not in room_2 anymore. So after step 2, if the agent is in front of grey_ball_2 in step 1, then step 1 is before step 2, so grey_ball_2 is still in room_2. Then after step 2, it's carried. So in steps after step 2, the agent is holding the ball, so in those states, the agent is not in front of grey_ball_2. So the only state where the agent is in front of grey_ball_2 is step 1, which is before any door unlocking. But blue_door_1 is locked in all states up to step 10. So the constraint requires that whenever blue_door_1 is locked (all steps up to 10), the agent must have been in front of grey_ball_2 in that state or a subsequent one. But step 1 is before all the door unlocks. So all states after step 1 (including steps 3-10) where blue_door_1 is locked must have the agent in front of grey_ball_2 in step 1 or after. Since step 1 is the only step where the agent is in front of grey_ball_2, and all the steps up to 10 are after step 1, this satisfies the constraint. Because for each state s where blue_door_1 is locked, step 1 is before s, so the agent was in front of grey_ball_2 in step 1, which is before s. Wait, no: the constraint says "at s or at some state after s". Wait, the constraint is:

"If expression "blue_door_1 is locked" holds in some state s, then expression "you are in front of grey_ball_2" must hold at s or at some state after s."

So for each state s where blue_door_1 is locked, the agent must be in front of grey_ball_2 either in s or in a state after s.

But in the plan, step 1 is in front of grey_ball_2. Then steps 3-10 are after step 2. So, for state s being any of steps 3-10 (before step 10), blue_door_1 is still locked. But the agent is not in front of grey_ball_2 in those states. So the constraint requires that in each such s, the agent must be in front of grey_ball_2 at s or after s. But after step 2, the agent is holding grey_ball_2, which is no longer in room_2. So being in front of grey_ball_2 is not possible anymore. Therefore, this plan would violate the constraint for states s after step 2 where blue_door_1 is still locked. For example, in step 3 (gotodoor yellow_door_2), blue_door_1 is locked. The agent is not in front of grey_ball_2 at step 3 or any step after that. Because grey_ball_2 is now in the agent's hand. So this plan would not satisfy the constraint.

Ah, this is a problem. So the initial approach is flawed.

So the agent must be in front of grey_ball_2 either during or after any state where blue_door_1 is locked. But after picking up grey_ball_2, the agent can't be in front of it anymore. So the only time they are in front of it is step 1. But after that, in steps 3-10, blue_door_1 is locked. So for each of those steps (s), the agent must have been in front of grey_ball_2 either in s or after s. But step 1 is before s, which is not allowed. The constraint requires that for each state s where blue_door_1 is locked, the agent must be in front of grey_ball_2 in s or in a state after s. So if s is step 3, then the agent must be in front of grey_ball_2 in step 3 or later. But after step 2, the agent is holding grey_ball_2, so they can't be in front of it. Unless they drop it again.

So this means that the initial plan is invalid. Therefore, the agent needs to be in front of grey_ball_2 at some point after each state where blue_door_1 is locked. But since blue_door_1 is locked until step 10, the agent must be in front of grey_ball_2 in step 10 or after. But step 10 is the last step, and after that, blue_door_1 is unlocked, so no more states where it's locked. Wait, but after step 10, the problem is solved. So the agent must be in front of grey_ball_2 at least once after any state where blue_door_1 is locked. But the only way to do that is to have the agent in front of grey_ball_2 after step 10, which is impossible since the plan ends. Therefore, the agent must be in front of grey_ball_2 in every state s where blue_door_1 is locked, which is impossible. Wait, no. The constraint is that for each state s where blue_door_1 is locked, there must be some state s' >= s where the agent is in front of grey_ball_2. But if the agent is in front of grey_ball_2 once, say at step 1, and then s is any state after step 1, then s' must be >= s. But step 1 is before s, so s' can't be >= s. So this is impossible unless the agent is in front of grey_ball_2 in every state after step 1. Which is not feasible.

This suggests that the constraint is stronger than I thought. Let me re-examine the constraint:

"The following expression must hold in at least one state: "blue_door_1 is locked""

Which is satisfied because initially it's locked.

"If expression "blue_door_1 is locked" holds in some state s, then expression "you are in front of grey_ball_2" must hold at s or at some state after s"

So for every state s where blue_door_1 is locked, there must be a state s' >= s where the agent is in front of grey_ball_2.

But if the agent is in front of grey_ball_2 at step 1 (s0), then for all states s >= s0 where blue_door_1 is locked, s' = s0 is before s. Which doesn't satisfy the condition. The constraint requires that s' >= s. Therefore, the agent must be in front of grey_ball_2 at some point after or during each state s where blue_door_1 is locked.

But this is impossible unless the agent is in front of grey_ball_2 infinitely many times, which is not possible in a finite plan. So the correct interpretation is that for each state s where blue_door_1 is locked, there exists a state s' >= s where the agent is in front of grey_ball_2.

But in our initial plan, after step 2, the agent is holding grey_ball_2, so cannot be in front of it. Therefore, the only way to satisfy the constraint is to have the agent in front of grey_ball_2 after step s where blue_door_1 is locked. So the agent must either:

1. Be in front of grey_ball_2 in every state s where blue_door_1 is locked (which is impossible), or

2. After any state s where blue_door_1 is locked, the agent must be in front of grey_ball_2 in some subsequent state.

But since blue_door_1 is locked until step 10, the latest state where it's locked is step 9 (before toggling). So for each state from the initial state up to step 9, the agent must be in front of grey_ball_2 in that state or later.

The only way to satisfy this is to have the agent in front of grey_ball_2 at least once after each state where blue_door_1 is locked. But that's not feasible unless the agent is in front of grey_ball_2 multiple times.

But since the agent is carrying grey_ball_2 after step 2, they can't be in front of it anymore. So the solution must involve not picking up grey_ball_2, but instead being in front of it multiple times. But how?

Alternatively, the agent could drop grey_ball_2 back into the room after picking it up, allowing them to go back and be in front of it again.

But this requires additional steps. Let's think:

Alternative plan:

1. gotoobject grey_ball_2 room_2 (step 1)

2. gotoempty (step 2)

3. drop grey_ball_2 room_2 (step 3)

Wait, but to drop, you need to be holding the object. So this approach won't work unless you pick it up first.

So:

1. gotoobject grey_ball_2 room_2

2. pick grey_ball_2 room_2 (now holding it)

3. gotoempty room_2

4. drop grey_ball_2 room_2 (now it's back in room_2)

This way, after step 4, grey_ball_2 is back in room_2, and the agent is in front of an empty spot. Now, the agent can go to grey_ball_2 again later.

But this adds steps. Then, after unlocking some doors, the agent can return to room_2 and go to grey_ball_2 again.

But how to do this in the plan?

For example:

1. gotoobject grey_ball_2 room_2

2. pick grey_ball_2 room_2

3. gotoempty room_2

4. drop grey_ball_2 room_2

5. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_2 room_4

6. toggle yellow_door_2

7. gotoroom room_2 room_4 yellow_door_2

8. gotodoor yellow_door_3 room_4 room_3

9. toggle yellow_door_3

10. gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_3

11. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_1

12. toggle blue_door_1

But now, after step 4, grey_ball_2 is back in room_2. The agent is in room_2. Then steps 5-7: go to room_4. Now, to satisfy the constraint, any state where blue_door_1 is locked (steps 1-12, up to step 12), the agent must be in front of grey_ball_2 in that state or after. But after step 7, the agent is in room_4. How to get back to room_2 to go to grey_ball_2 again?

After step 7, they are in room_4. They can go back to room_2 through yellow_door_2 (which is unlocked). So steps could be:

After step 7 (in room_4), the agent can go back to room_2, go to grey_ball_2 again.

But this adds more steps. For example:

8. gotoroom room_4 room_2 yellow_door_2 (step 8)

9. gotoobject grey_ball_2 room_2 (step 9)

10. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_2 room_4 (step 10)

11. toggle yellow_door_2 (but it's already unlocked)

Wait, but then they can proceed to room_4 again. But this is making the plan longer. 

But the constraint is that for each state s where blue_door_1 is locked, there exists a state s' >= s where the agent is in front of grey_ball_2. So if after step 7 (agent is in room_4), blue_door_1 is still locked. So the agent needs to be in front of grey_ball_2 in a state after step 7. But grey_ball_2 is in room_2. So the agent must return to room_2, go to grey_ball_2 again.

So steps would be:

After step 7 (in room_4), agent returns to room_2:

8. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_2 (room_4 is connected via yellow_door_2 to room_2)

But the door is in room_4's side. Wait, doors are bidirectional. To go from room_4 to room_2 via yellow_door_2, the agent must be in room_4, go to the door in room_4.

Wait, the 'gotodoor' action is "gotodoor d r1 r2" where the agent is in r1, which is connected via d to r2. So in room_4, the doors are yellow_door_2 (connecting to room_2) and yellow_door_3 (connecting to room_3). So in room_4, agent can gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_2.

Then toggle it (but it's already unlocked), then go back to room_2.

So steps:

8. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_2

9. gotoroom room_4 room_2 yellow_door_2 (now back in room_2)

10. gotoobject grey_ball_2 room_2

Then proceed to room_4 again:

11. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_2 room_4

12. gotoroom room_2 room_4 yellow_door_2

Then proceed to yellow_door_3, etc.

But this is adding many steps, making the plan longer, which contradicts the requirement for an optimal (shortest) plan.

This suggests that the initial approach is invalid due to the constraint. So we need a different strategy.

Alternative idea: instead of picking up grey_ball_2, just go to it multiple times.

But the agent must hold some object at least once. So they need to pick up something. But perhaps pick up a different object, allowing grey_ball_2 to remain in room_2, so that the agent can be in front of it multiple times.

Looking at the objects in room_2: yellow_box_1, grey_ball_2, purple_ball_1. So maybe pick up purple_ball_1 instead.

So steps:

1. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_2

2. pick purple_ball_1 room_2 (satisfy holding constraint)

3. gotoempty room_2

4. drop purple_ball_1 room_2

Now, purple_ball_1 is back in room_2. The agent is not holding anything. Then proceed to unlock doors. But then, the agent can go to grey_ball_2 multiple times.

But how to satisfy the constraint that for every state s where blue_door_1 is locked, there's a state s' >= s where agent is in front of grey_ball_2.

If the agent goes to grey_ball_2 after each time they toggle a door, that's possible. But this would make the plan very long.

Alternatively, the agent could go to grey_ball_2 once after the last time they are in a state where blue_door_1 is locked. But blue_door_1 is locked until step where they toggle it. So after toggling it, it's unlocked. So the latest state where blue_door_1 is locked is just before toggling it. So if the agent goes to grey_ball_2 after toggling blue_door_1, but that's too late, because after toggling, blue_door_1 is unlocked, so the constraint no longer applies. Wait, no. The constraint is that for every state s where blue_door_1 is locked, the agent must be in front of grey_ball_2 in s or later. So for s being the state before toggling, the agent must be in front of grey_ball_2 in that state or after. So if the agent is in front of grey_ball_2 after unlocking blue_door_1, but grey_ball_2 is in room_2, and the agent is in room_3, they can't do that.

This is getting complicated. Let's rethink.

Perhaps the only way to satisfy the constraint is to have the agent in front of grey_ball_2 after each time they perform an action that leaves blue_door_1 locked. But since blue_door_1 remains locked until the last step, the agent needs to be in front of grey_ball_2 after every action until they unlock blue_door_1. Which is impossible unless they continuously go back and forth, which is not optimal.

Alternative approach: Maybe the agent can unlock blue_door_1 without needing to go through all the other doors. For example, if they can somehow reach blue_door_1 from room_2 without going through room_1. But how?

The connections are:

room_1 connected to room_2 via yellow_door_1 (locked)

room_1 connected to room_3 via blue_door_1 (locked)

room_2 connected to room_4 via yellow_door_2 (locked)

room_3 connected to room_4 via yellow_door_3 (locked)

So the agent starts in room_2. All doors are locked. To reach room_3, the agent must unlock yellow_door_2 to room_4, then yellow_door_3 to room_3. Then unlock blue_door_1. But this requires several steps.

But the constraint requires that every time blue_door_1 is locked, the agent is in front of grey_ball_2 either then or later. So the agent must be in front of grey_ball_2 after unlocking the other doors. But how?

Perhaps the agent can go to grey_ball_2 after unlocking each door, but that would add steps. Let's try:

Plan outline:

1. gotoobject grey_ball_2 room_2 (satisfies front of grey_ball_2)

2. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_2 room_4

3. toggle yellow_door_2 (unlock)

4. gotoroom room_2 room_4 yellow_door_2

5. gotodoor yellow_door_3 room_4 room_3

6. toggle yellow_door_3 (unlock)

7. gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_3

8. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_1

9. toggle blue_door_1 (unlock)

But this plan doesn't include picking up any object, so the "must hold some object" constraint is not met. So we need to add steps to pick up and drop an object.

But also, the agent must be in front of grey_ball_2 after each state where blue_door_1 is locked. So after steps 2-9, blue_door_1 is locked until step 9. So the agent must be in front of grey_ball_2 after each of those steps. For example, after step 2 (blue_door_1 is locked), agent must be in front of grey_ball_2 in step 2 or later. They were in front of it in step 1, which is before step 2. So that's not sufficient.

Thus, this approach doesn't work. The agent must visit grey_ball_2 after each step where blue_door_1 is locked. Which is impossible unless they return to room_2 multiple times.

This suggests that the only way to satisfy the constraint is to have the agent in front of grey_ball_2 multiple times in the plan. For example, after each action that leaves blue_door_1 locked, the agent must go back to room_2 and be in front of grey_ball_2. But this would make the plan very long.

Alternative idea: Perhaps the agent can pick up grey_ball_2, carry it to other rooms, and drop it in a position where they can be in front of it again. But dropping it requires being in front of an empty position. So if the agent carries grey_ball_2 to room_4, drops it there, then they can be in front of it in room_4. But then, the constraint requires being in front of grey_ball_2, which is now in room_4. But the constraint specifies grey_ball_2, which is a specific object. So the agent must be in front of the specific grey_ball_2 object, which was moved to room_4. So that would satisfy the constraint. However, the agent is not allowed to be in room_1, but room_4 is allowed.

So perhaps:

1. gotoobject grey_ball_2 room_2

2. pick grey_ball_2 room_2 (now holding it)

3. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_2 room_4

4. toggle yellow_door_2

5. gotoroom room_2 room_4 yellow_door_2

6. gotoempty room_4

7. drop grey_ball_2 room_4

Now, grey_ball_2 is in room_4. Then, whenever needed, the agent can go to grey_ball_2 in room_4 to satisfy the constraint.

Proceeding:

8. gotodoor yellow_door_3 room_4 room_3

9. toggle yellow_door_3

10. gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_3

11. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_1

12. toggle blue_door_1

Now, after step 12, blue_door_1 is unlocked. The agent is in front of it.

But during steps 3-12, blue_door_1 is locked. The agent needs to be in front of grey_ball_2 (now in room_4) during or after each of those steps.

For example, after step 3, agent is in front of yellow_door_2. Blue_door_1 is locked. The agent must be in front of grey_ball_2 (now in room_4) in step 3 or after. So after step 7, grey_ball_2 is in room_4. The agent is in room_4. So steps 6-7:

6. gotoempty room_4

7. drop grey_ball_2 room_4

So after step 7, the agent is in front of grey_ball_2 in room_4. Then, in steps 8-12, whenever blue_door_1 is locked (until step 12), the agent can go to grey_ball_2 in room_4.

For example, after step 8 (gotodoor yellow_door_3 in room_4), blue_door_1 is locked. The agent must be in front of grey_ball_2 in step 8 or later. So after step 8, they can do:

9. gotoobject grey_ball_2 room_4

But this adds steps. Alternatively, after dropping grey_ball_2 in room_4 (step 7), the agent is in front of it. So step 7 satisfies being in front of grey_ball_2. Then, for any subsequent steps where blue_door_1 is locked (steps 8-12), the agent must be in front of grey_ball_2 in those steps or after. But after step 7, the agent is in front of grey_ball_2. Then, steps 8-12: in step 8, agent goes to door yellow_door_3 in room_4. Blue_door_1 is still locked. The agent must be in front of grey_ball_2 in step 8 or after. Since they were in front of it in step 7 (before step 8), does that count? No, because step 7 is before step 8. The constraint requires that for state s (step 8), there exists a state s' >= s where agent is in front of grey_ball_2. So after step 8, the agent can go to grey_ball_2 in room_4:

9. gotoobject grey_ball_2 room_4

But this adds steps. So the plan would be:

1. gotoobject grey_ball_2 room_2

2. pick grey_ball_2 room_2

3. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_2 room_4

4. toggle yellow_door_2

5. gotoroom room_2 room_4 yellow_door_2

6. gotoempty room_4

7. drop grey_ball_2 room_4

8. gotoobject grey_ball_2 room_4

9. gotodoor yellow_door_3 room_4 room_3

10. toggle yellow_door_3

11. gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_3

12. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_1

13. toggle blue_door_1

This way, after step 7, the agent is in front of grey_ball_2. Then after step 8, again in front of it. But step 8 is redundant. Alternatively, after step 7, agent is in front of grey_ball_2. Then, for step 9 (gotodoor yellow_door_3), blue_door_1 is locked. The agent must be in front of grey_ball_2 in step 9 or after. Since step 9 is after step 7, but step 7 is before step 9, it doesn't satisfy. So after step 9, agent is in front of yellow_door_3. So they need to go to grey_ball_2 again.

This is getting too complicated. Perhaps the correct approach is to ensure that after every action that leaves blue_door_1 locked, the agent is in front of grey_ball_2 in the next step. But this seems impossible without adding many steps.

Given time constraints, perhaps the correct plan is the initial one, but with an additional step to drop the grey_ball_2 back and go to it again. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the agent can pick up a different object to satisfy the "hold some object" constraint and leave grey_ball_2 in room_2, allowing multiple visits.

Let's try:

Plan:

1. gotoobject grey_ball_2 room_2

2. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_2 room_4

3. toggle yellow_door_2

4. gotoroom room_2 room_4 yellow_door_2

5. gotodoor yellow_door_3 room_4 room_3

6. toggle yellow_door_3

7. gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_3

8. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_1

9. toggle blue_door_1

But steps 1-9 don't include picking up an object. So the constraint about holding an object is not met. So the agent needs to pick up something. So pick up grey_ball_2:

1. gotoobject grey_ball_2 room_2

2. pick grey_ball_2 room_2

3. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_2 room_4

4. toggle yellow_door_2

5. gotoroom room_2 room_4 yellow_door_2

6. gotodoor yellow_door_3 room_4 room_3

7. toggle yellow_door_3

8. gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_3

9. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_1

10. toggle blue_door_1

This plan has 10 steps. But the constraint about being in front of grey_ball_2 after each state where blue_door_1 is locked is not satisfied. For example, after step 3, agent is in front of yellow_door_2. Blue_door_1 is locked. They need to be in front of grey_ball_2 in step 3 or after. But after step 2, grey_ball_2 is picked up, so agent can't be in front of it. Therefore, this plan is invalid.

I think this problem is quite complex, and I'm not sure I can find the optimal plan within the time I have. But perhaps the correct approach is to pick up a different object, such as purple_ball_1 in room_2, to satisfy the holding constraint, and leave grey_ball_2 in room_2, allowing multiple visits. For example:

1. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_2

2. pick purple_ball_1 room_2

3. gotoempty room_2

4. drop purple_ball_1 room_2 (now it's back in room_2)

5. gotoobject grey_ball_2 room_2 (satisfy constraint for initial states)

6. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_2 room_4

7. toggle yellow_door_2

8. gotoroom room_2 room_4 yellow_door_2

9. gotodoor yellow_door_3 room_4 room_3

10. toggle yellow_door_3

11. gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_3

12. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_1

13. toggle blue_door_1

But then, after step 5, the agent is in front of grey_ball_2. For any subsequent steps where blue_door_1 is locked (steps 6-13), they must be in front of grey_ball_2 in those steps or after. But after step 5, the agent moves to door yellow_door_2 and beyond, so they are not in front of grey_ball_2. Thus, this plan also fails.

Given the time I've spent and the complexity, I think the correct plan involves the agent picking up grey_ball_2 early, then dropping it back, and then going to it again later. But this requires many steps, but perhaps it's the only way.

Final plan attempt:

1. gotoobject grey_ball_2 room_2

2. pick grey_ball_2 room_2

3. gotoempty room_2

4. drop grey_ball_2 room_2

5. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_2 room_4

6. toggle yellow_door_2

7. gotoroom room_2 room_4 yellow_door_2

8. gotodoor yellow_door_3 room_4 room_3

9. toggle yellow_door_3

10. gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_3

11. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_1

12. toggle blue_door_1

13. gotoroom room_3 room_2 (but how?)

Wait, no, after step 10, agent is in room_3. To return to room_2, they'd need to go back through room_4 and room_2, but that's possible. But this is getting too long. Given time constraints, I think the best I can do is provide the initial plan but with the necessary steps to satisfy the constraint, even if it's longer.
