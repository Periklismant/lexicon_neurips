Let me analyze this problem carefully:

1. The initial state:
   - I'm in room_3
   - grey_ball_1, red_box_1, and green_ball_1 are in room_1
   - grey_box_1 and red_box_2 are in room_2
   - blue_box_1 and purple_box_1 are in room_3 (same room as me)
   - grey_box_2 is in room_4
   - All doors are locked
   - I'm not holding any object

2. The goal:
   - To be in front of a grey box (either grey_box_1 in room_2 or grey_box_2 in room_4)

3. Constraints:
   - I can never be in room_4 (this means I can't go to grey_box_2)
   - green_door_1 must be locked at some point (this is already true in the initial state)
   - If green_door_1 is locked at some state, I must hold blue_box_1 at that state or later
   - green_door_1 must be unlocked at some point
   - If green_door_1 is unlocked at some state, I must have held blue_box_1 in an earlier state

Since I can't be in room_4 (constraint), my goal must be to reach grey_box_1 in room_2.

Let's plan this:

1. I start in room_3.
2. I need to pick up blue_box_1 (which is in room_3) before unlocking green_door_1 (constraint).
3. I need to reach room_2 to get to grey_box_1.
4. To go from room_3 to room_2, I can go:
   - room_3 -> room_1 (through grey_door_1) -> room_2 (through purple_door_1)
   - or room_3 -> room_4 (through green_door_1) -> room_2 (through red_door_1), but I can't be in room_4.

So my path must be room_3 -> room_1 -> room_2:
1. Go to blue_box_1 in room_3
2. Pick up blue_box_1
3. Unlock green_door_1 (to satisfy the constraint that it must be unlocked at some point)
4. Go to grey_door_1
5. Unlock grey_door_1
6. Go to room_1
7. Go to purple_door_1
8. Unlock purple_door_1
9. Go to room_2
10. Go to grey_box_1
11. Done!

But wait, I need to check if I can actually unlock the doors. To toggle a door, I need to be in front of it. 

Let's redo the plan:

1. In room_3, go to blue_box_1
2. Pick up blue_box_1 (now holding it)
3. Go to green_door_1
4. Toggle green_door_1 (now unlocked)
5. Go to grey_door_1
6. Toggle grey_door_1 (now unlocked)
7. Go to room_1 through grey_door_1
8. Go to purple_door_1
9. Toggle purple_door_1 (now unlocked)
10. Go to room_2 through purple_door_1
11. Go to grey_box_1
12. Done!

Wait, there's a problem. I need to drop blue_box_1 before I can toggle any door, because I can only toggle a door if I'm in front of it, and I can only be in front of a door if I'm not holding anything (based on the constraints).

Let's redo the plan:

1. In room_3, go to blue_box_1
2. Pick up blue_box_1 (now holding it)
3. Go to an empty position (to drop the box)
4. Drop blue_box_1
5. Go to green_door_1
6. Toggle green_door_1 (now unlocked)
7. Go to grey_door_1
8. Toggle grey_door_1 (now unlocked)
9. Go to room_1 through grey_door_1
10. Go to purple_door_1
11. Toggle purple_door_1 (now unlocked)
12. Go to room_2 through purple_door_1
13. Go to grey_box_1
14. Done!

Let's check if this satisfies all the constraints:
- I'm never in room_4
- green_door_1 is locked at some point (in the initial state)
- After green_door_1 is locked, I will hold blue_box_1 (in step 2)
- green_door_1 is unlocked at some point (in step 6)
- Before green_door_1 is unlocked, I have held blue_box_1 (in step 2)

This plan satisfies all the constraints and achieves the goal.

Now let's write out the exact plan with the proper action formats:

```
gotoobject blue_box_1 room_3
pick blue_box_1 room_3
gotoempty
drop blue_box_1 room_3
gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4
toggle green_door_1
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1
toggle grey_door_1
gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2
toggle purple_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1
gotoobject grey_box_1 room_2
```

Actually, let me reconsider some aspects. The constraint about green_door_1 says:

"If expression 'green_door_1 is locked' holds in some state s, then expression 'you are holding blue_box_1' must hold at s or at some state after s."

In the initial state, green_door_1 is locked, so I must hold blue_box_1 at some point. This is satisfied by steps 1-2.

"If expression 'green_door_1 is not locked' holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: 'you are holding blue_box_1'."

After step 6, green_door_1 will be unlocked, so I must have held blue_box_1 earlier, which is satisfied by steps 1-2.

So the plan does satisfy all constraints. Let me finalize the plan:

```
gotoobject blue_box_1 room_3
pick blue_box_1 room_3
gotoempty
drop blue_box_1 room_3
gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4
toggle green_door_1
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1
toggle grey_door_1
gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2
toggle purple_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1
gotoobject grey_box_1 room_2
```

Actually, let me double-check the rules of the domain again to make sure I'm not missing anything.

From the rules, I see:
1. "goto object": I can only go in front of an object if I'm in the same room.
2. "goto empty": I can go in front of an empty position anytime.
3. "goto door": I can only go in front of a door if (i) I'm in a room the door connects to, and (ii) there's no object blocking the door.
4. "goto room": I can only go to a room if (i) I'm in a room adjacent to it, and (ii) the connecting door is unlocked.
5. "pick": I can only pick up an object if (i) I'm in the same room, and (ii) I'm not holding any object.
6. "drop": I can only drop an object if (i) I'm holding it, and (ii) the position in front of me is empty.
7. "toggle": I can only toggle a door if I'm in front of it.

And checking my plan again, it seems valid according to these rules. Let me think if there's anything I'm missing or if there's a shorter plan.

Actually, I don't think there's a shorter valid plan. The essential steps are:
1. Pick up blue_box_1 (to satisfy the constraint)
2. Toggle green_door_1 (to satisfy the constraint)
3. Navigate to room_2 via room_1 (can't go through room_4)
4. Go to grey_box_1

Given these essentials, the plan I've outlined is minimal.

```
gotoobject blue_box_1 room_3
pick blue_box_1 room_3
gotoempty
drop blue_box_1 room_3
gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4
toggle green_door_1
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1
toggle grey_door_1
gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2
toggle purple_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1
gotoobject grey_box_1 room_2
```

However, I'm realizing there might be an issue with my plan. The constraint says "If green_door_1 is locked at some state s, then expression 'you are holding blue_box_1' must hold at s or at some state after s." In the initial state, green_door_1 is locked, but I don't pick up blue_box_1 until later. I'm not sure if this counts as "at s or at some state after s." Let me reread the constraints to make sure.

Actually, I think my plan is fine. The constraint is saying that at some point, green_door_1 is locked (which is true in the initial state), and at that point or later, I should be holding blue_box_1 (which is true when I pick it up).

Wait, I just realized I misunderstood the constraints a bit. The third constraint says: "If expression 'green_door_1 is locked' holds in some state s, then expression 'you are holding blue_box_1' must hold at s or at some state after s."

Since green_door_1 is locked in the initial state, I need to hold blue_box_1 at some point. But I also need to ensure that if green_door_1 ever becomes locked again, I need to hold blue_box_1 at that point or later.

Similarly, the fifth constraint says: "If expression 'green_door_1 is not locked' holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: 'you are holding blue_box_1'."

So if green_door_1 ever becomes unlocked, I must have held blue_box_1 earlier.

Given these constraints, my current plan works: I pick up blue_box_1, then I toggle green_door_1 to unlock it. This way, when green_door_1 is unlocked, I have already held blue_box_1 earlier.

Alright, I'm confident in my plan now:

```
gotoobject blue_box_1 room_3
pick blue_box_1 room_3
gotoempty
drop blue_box_1 room_3
gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4
toggle green_door_1
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1
toggle grey_door_1
gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2
toggle purple_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1
gotoobject grey_box_1 room_2
```

But wait, I think there's one more issue. The constraints indicate that green_door_1 should be locked at some point (which is already true in the initial state), and also that it should be unlocked at some point. However, there's also a constraint saying that if green_door_1 is locked at state s, I must hold blue_box_1 at s or later. In the initial state, green_door_1 is locked, so I need to hold blue_box_1. But the constraint also applies if green_door_1 becomes locked again.

Let's modify the plan to ensure all constraints are met:

1. I start in room_3.
2. I go to blue_box_1.
3. I pick up blue_box_1 (this satisfies the constraint about holding blue_box_1 after green_door_1 is locked, which is the initial state).
4. I go to an empty position and drop blue_box_1.
5. I go to green_door_1.
6. I toggle green_door_1 (now it's unlocked, satisfying the constraint that green_door_1 must be unlocked at some point).
7. I go to grey_door_1.
8. I toggle grey_door_1 (now it's unlocked).
9. I go to room_1 through grey_door_1.
10. I go to purple_door_1.
11. I toggle purple_door_1 (now it's unlocked).
12. I go to room_2 through purple_door_1.
13. I go to grey_box_1.
14. Done!

This plan seems to satisfy all the constraints:
- I never enter room_4.
- green_door_1 is locked at some point (in the initial state).
- After green_door_1 is locked (in the initial state), I hold blue_box_1 (in step 3).
- green_door_1 is unlocked at some point (in step 6).
- Before green_door_1 is unlocked (in step 6), I have held blue_box_1 (in step 3).

Let me formalize this plan using the action formats:

```
gotoobject blue_box_1 room_3
pick blue_box_1 room_3
gotoempty
drop blue_box_1 room_3
gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4
toggle green_door_1
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1
toggle grey_door_1
gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2
toggle purple_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1
gotoobject grey_box_1 room_2
```

I think this is the optimal plan for this problem, satisfying all the constraints.

Actually, there's one more confusion I have. The third constraint says "If expression 'green_door_1 is locked' holds in some state s, then expression 'you are holding blue_box_1' must hold at s or at some state after s."

In the initial state, green_door_1 is locked. But I'm not holding blue_box_1 in the initial state. I pick it up in step 3, which is a state after the initial state. Is this allowed by the constraint? I believe it is, because the constraint says "at s or at some state after s".

So if I interpret the constraint as follows:
- In any state where green_door_1 is locked, I must hold blue_box_1 in that same state or in a later state.

Then my plan satisfies this constraint:
- In the initial state, green_door_1 is locked, and I hold blue_box_1 in a later state (step 3).
- After I toggle green_door_1 in step 6, it is no longer locked, so the constraint doesn't apply.

And for the fifth constraint: "If expression 'green_door_1 is not locked' holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: 'you are holding blue_box_1'."

This is satisfied too:
- After step 6, green_door_1 is not locked.
- In an earlier state (step 3), I held blue_box_1.

So I believe my plan is valid and optimal. Let me check one more time to see if there's any way to further optimize:

```
gotoobject blue_box_1 room_3
pick blue_box_1 room_3
gotoempty
drop blue_box_1 room_3
gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4
toggle green_door_1
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1
toggle grey_door_1
gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2
toggle purple_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1
gotoobject grey_box_1 room_2
```

Each step seems necessary for the goal and to satisfy the constraints, so I don't see a way to further optimize. This seems to be the optimal plan.

I'm realizing there's a bit of ambiguity with the constraints. Let me spell out the constraints to clarity:

1. "The following expression must hold in every state: 'you are not in room_4'". This means I can never enter room_4.
2. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'green_door_1 is locked'". This is true in the initial state.
3. "If expression 'green_door_1 is locked' holds in some state s, then expression 'you are holding blue_box_1' must hold at s or at some state after s." This means that after green_door_1 is observed to be locked, I must hold blue_box_1 at some point.
4. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'green_door_1 is not locked'". This means I must unlock green_door_1 at some point.
5. "If expression 'green_door_1 is not locked' holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: 'you are holding blue_box_1'". This means that before green_door_1 is observed to be unlocked, I must have held blue_box_1.

Given these constraints, my plan is:
1. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_3
2. pick blue_box_1 room_3
3. gotoempty
4. drop blue_box_1 room_3
5. gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4
6. toggle green_door_1
7. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1
8. toggle grey_door_1
9. gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1
10. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2
11. toggle purple_door_1
12. gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1
13. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_2

Let's check if this plan satisfies the constraints:
- I never enter room_4. Satisfied.
- green_door_1 is locked in at least one state (initial state). Satisfied.
- If green_door_1 is locked at state s, I hold blue_box_1 at state s or later. In the initial state, green_door_1 is locked, and I later hold blue_box_1 (step 2). Satisfied.
- green_door_1 is not locked in at least one state (after step 6). Satisfied.
- If green_door_1 is not locked at some state, I have held blue_box_1 at an earlier state. After step 6, green_door_1 is not locked, and I have held blue_box_1 at an earlier state (step 2). Satisfied.

So this plan satisfies all constraints and achieves the goal. I believe it's optimal, as each step seems necessary.

```
gotoobject blue_box_1 room_3
pick blue_box_1 room_3
gotoempty
drop blue_box_1 room_3
gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4
toggle green_door_1
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1
toggle grey_door_1
gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2
toggle purple_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1
gotoobject grey_box_1 room_2
```

I'm pretty confident that this is the optimal plan for the problem, satisfying all the given constraints.

Let me see if there's any other edge case I miss...

Hmm, constraint 4 says: "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'green_door_1 is not locked'". This suggests I must bring about a state where green_door_1 is not locked. In step 6, I toggle green_door_1, changing it from locked to unlocked. So this satisfies this constraint.

Constraint 5 says: "If expression 'green_door_1 is not locked' holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: 'you are holding blue_box_1'". So before green_door_1 is unlocked, I must have held blue_box_1. In step 2, I pick up blue_box_1, and then in step 6, I unlock green_door_1. This satisfies the constraint.

Constraint 3 says: "If expression 'green_door_1 is locked' holds in some state s, then expression 'you are holding blue_box_1' must hold at s or at some state after s." In the initial state, green_door_1 is locked, and in step 2, I pick up blue_box_1. This satisfies the constraint.

So my plan satisfies all the constraints and achieves the goal in the most efficient way possible.

```
gotoobject blue_box_1 room_3
pick blue_box_1 room_3
gotoempty
drop blue_box_1 room_3
gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4
toggle green_door_1
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1
toggle grey_door_1
gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2
toggle purple_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1
gotoobject grey_box_1 room_2
```

This is my final optimal plan.
