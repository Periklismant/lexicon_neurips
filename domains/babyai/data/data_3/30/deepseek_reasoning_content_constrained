Okay, let's tackle this planning problem step by step. First, I need to understand the goal and the constraints. The final goal is to have a grey box that I'm in front of. The constraints are a bit complex, so I need to make sure I address each one properly.

Starting with the initial state: I'm in room_3. The grey boxes are grey_box_1 in room_2, grey_box_2 in room_4, and grey_ball_1 in room_1. But the goal is a box, so grey_ball_1 is out. Since room_4 is off-limits due to the constraint that I can never be there, grey_box_2 is not accessible. That leaves grey_box_1 in room_2. So the target is grey_box_1 in room_2.

But how do I get to room_2 from room_3? Let's look at the doors. The connections are room_1-room_2 via purple_door_1, room_1-room_3 via grey_door_1, room_2-room_4 via red_door_1, and room_3-room_4 via green_door_1. All doors are initially locked. So from room_3, the doors are grey_door_1 (connects to room_1) and green_door_1 (to room_4). But I can't go to room_4. So to get to room_2, maybe I need to go through room_1? From room_3 to room_1 via grey_door_1, then room_1 to room_2 via purple_door_1. But both doors are locked. So I need to unlock them.

But wait, the constraints require that green_door_1 must be locked in at least one state and unlocked in at least one state. Also, if green_door_1 is ever locked, I must be holding blue_box_1 at that state or later. And if it's ever unlocked, I must have held blue_box_1 before. Hmm. So handling green_door_1 is important here.

Since I start in room_3, which has blue_box_1 and purple_box_1. To unlock green_door_1, I need to toggle it. But to toggle a door, I need to be in front of it. So first, I might need to go to green_door_1. But green_door_1 connects room_3 and room_4. But room_4 is forbidden. However, just going in front of the door in room_3 should be possible, right? As long as there's no object blocking it. But the initial state doesn't mention any objects blocking doors. Wait, the preconditions for "goto door" say that there's no object blocking the position in front of d in the current room. So if the door isn't blocked, I can go there.

In room_3, the objects are blue_box_1 and purple_box_1. Are they blocking the doors? The initial state doesn't specify, but maybe the doors are unblocked unless an object is in front. Since the problem doesn't mention any objects blocking doors initially, I assume doors are not blocked. So I can go to green_door_1 from room_3.

So, to toggle green_door_1, I need to first goto the door, then toggle it. But the constraints say that if green_door_1 is locked (which it is initially), then I must be holding blue_box_1 at that state or later. Wait, the initial state has green_door_1 locked. So the first state already has it locked. But the constraint says that in at least one state, green_door_1 is locked. Since it starts locked, that's already satisfied. But another constraint says that if green_door_1 is locked in some state, then I must hold blue_box_1 in that state or a later one. So if I leave green_door_1 locked, I need to pick up blue_box_1 at some point. But the initial state is already locked, so maybe that's a problem. Wait, the constraint says "in every state", you are not in room_4. So we can ignore room_4.

But the problem is, the initial state has green_door_1 locked. So according to the constraint, whenever green_door_1 is locked (including the initial state), I must hold blue_box_1 at that state or later. But in the initial state, I'm not holding anything. So that's a violation. Wait, no. The constraint says "if the expression 'green_door_1 is locked' holds in some state s, then 'you are holding blue_box_1' must hold at s or after." So the initial state s0 has green_door_1 locked, so I must hold blue_box_1 in s0 or in a subsequent state. Since in s0 I don't hold it, I must pick it up at some point after.

Additionally, another constraint requires that green_door_1 is unlocked in at least one state, and if it's unlocked, then I must have held blue_box_1 before. So I need to toggle green_door_1 at least once. Let me think.

So the plan must include toggling green_door_1. Let's outline steps:

1. From room_3, go to green_door_1 (since it's in room_3, connecting to room_4). But I can't enter room_4, but just being in front of the door is okay as long as I don't go through. So gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4.

But wait, the action is "gotodoor d r1 r2": Go in front of door d, connecting room r1 to r2. So for green_door_1 in room_3, the correct action would be "gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4".

After that, toggle green_door_1. This will unlock it. Then, perhaps I need to lock it again to satisfy the "must be locked in at least one state". Wait, but the initial state is already locked. So unlocking it would make it not locked, then maybe lock it again. But the constraints require that green_door_1 is locked in at least one state (which is already true) and also that it's not locked in at least one state. So we need to toggle it once to unlock, then maybe toggle again to lock. But each toggle changes the state.

But each toggle requires being in front of the door. Also, the constraints related to blue_box_1: when green_door_1 is locked (as in initial state), I must hold blue_box_1 at some point after. Also, when green_door_1 is unlocked (after first toggle), I must have held blue_box_1 before that.

Wait, the fourth constraint says: if green_door_1 is not locked in some state, there must be an earlier state where I held blue_box_1. So when I unlock green_door_1 (i.e., toggle it from locked to unlocked), that state is when it becomes not locked. Therefore, before that toggle action, I need to have held blue_box_1. So the order is: pick up blue_box_1, then go to green_door_1, toggle it (unlocking), which makes green_door_1 not locked. That satisfies the fourth constraint because I held blue_box_1 before unlocking. Then, maybe toggle it again to lock, which would satisfy the second constraint (since it's locked again), but then I have to hold blue_box_1 at that state or after. But if I already held it before, maybe that's okay? Wait, the third constraint says that if in any state s, green_door_1 is locked, then in s or after, I hold blue_box_1. So when I lock it again (after unlocking), in that state s (where it becomes locked), I need to be holding blue_box_1 or do so later. But if I drop blue_box_1 after unlocking, then when I lock it again, I might not be holding it, which would violate the constraint. So perhaps I need to hold blue_box_1 throughout.

Alternatively, maybe the plan needs to pick up blue_box_1 first, then do the toggles. Let's outline:

1. In room_3, pick up blue_box_1. But to pick it up, I need to be in front of it. So first, gotoobject blue_box_1 room_3. Then pick it.

Then, go to green_door_1 (gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4). Then toggle it (unlocking). Now green_door_1 is unlocked. This satisfies the constraint that in some state, green_door_1 is not locked. Also, since we picked blue_box_1 before, that satisfies the fourth constraint (if it's unlocked, we held it before). Then, perhaps toggle it again (locking it), which would satisfy the second constraint (green_door_1 is locked in that state). But in that state (after locking), we need to be holding blue_box_1 at that state or later. Since we are holding it when we toggle, that's okay.

But after that, we need to proceed to get to room_2 where the grey_box_1 is.

So after handling green_door_1, we need to go to room_1 via grey_door_1. But grey_door_1 is locked. So need to unlock it. How?

Grey_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3. To unlock it, we need to be in front of it in either room_1 or room_3. Since we're in room_3, we can go to grey_door_1 (gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1), then toggle it. But grey_door_1 is initially locked. So toggling it would unlock it. But we're holding blue_box_1, which is okay.

Wait, but the action of toggling doesn't require holding anything, just being in front of the door. So after picking blue_box_1, we can go to grey_door_1, unlock it, then proceed to room_1.

Wait, but the problem is that after unlocking grey_door_1, we can go to room_1. Then from room_1, go to room_2 via purple_door_1, which is locked. So need to unlock that as well.

Purple_door_1 connects room_1 and room_2. So in room_1, we can go to purple_door_1 (gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2), then toggle it (unlock), then go to room_2.

Once in room_2, find grey_box_1, go in front of it, and drop any object if needed. But the goal is to be in front of a grey box. So after reaching room_2, gotoobject grey_box_1 room_2. Then the plan is done.

But let's make sure all constraints are met.

First, the constraint that in every state, I'm not in room_4. Since I never go to room_4, that's satisfied.

Second, green_door_1 must be locked in at least one state. Initially, it's locked. Also, after unlocking and then locking again, it would be locked again. So that's covered.

Third, every time green_door_1 is locked (including the initial state), I must hold blue_box_1 at that state or after. The initial state has green_door_1 locked and me not holding blue_box_1, which violates the third constraint unless I pick it up later. So after the initial state, I pick up blue_box_1, which is after the initial state, so the third constraint is satisfied for the initial state's locked door because I later hold blue_box_1.

Fourth, green_door_1 must be not locked in at least one state. That's achieved when we toggle it to unlock.

Fifth, when green_door_1 is not locked, we must have held blue_box_1 before. Since we pick it up before toggling to unlock, that's satisfied.

Now, the steps:

1. Pick up blue_box_1 in room_3.

   - Need to be in front of it: gotoobject blue_box_1 room_3.
   - Then pick it up.

But wait, to pick up, I need to be in the same room and not holding anything. Initially, I'm not holding anything, so that's okay.

So:

Action: gotoobject blue_box_1 room_3
Action: pick blue_box_1 room_3

Now holding blue_box_1.

Next, go to green_door_1 in room_3:

Action: gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4

Then toggle it (unlock):

Action: toggle green_door_1

Now green_door_1 is unlocked. Then, to satisfy the second constraint (green_door_1 must be locked in some state), perhaps we need to lock it again. But since the initial state already has it locked, maybe we don't need to. However, the third constraint says that whenever it's locked (including the initial state), I must hold blue_box_1 in that state or after. The initial state is a problem because I wasn't holding it then, but after picking it up, all subsequent states where it's locked (if we lock it again) will have me holding blue_box_1 or after.

Wait, but if I unlock it and leave it unlocked, then the only states where it's locked are the initial state and any after I lock it again. The initial state's condition requires that I hold blue_box_1 at some point after. Since I pick it up after the initial state, that's okay. So perhaps I don't need to lock it again. But let me check the constraints:

- The second constraint requires that in at least one state, green_door_1 is locked. The initial state counts, so that's covered.

- The third constraint requires that if in any state s, green_door_1 is locked, then in s or after, I hold blue_box_1. The initial state s0: green_door_1 is locked, and I'm not holding blue_box_1. But the plan must ensure that in s0 or after, I hold it. Since after s0, I do pick it up, that's okay. So the third constraint is satisfied because after s0, I pick up blue_box_1.

So maybe I don't need to lock green_door_1 again. That would save steps.

Proceeding:

After unlocking green_door_1, next step is to go to grey_door_1 in room_3 (connects to room_1). But grey_door_1 is locked. So need to toggle it.

So:

From room_3, after toggling green_door_1, go to grey_door_1:

Action: gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1

Then toggle it:

Action: toggle grey_door_1

Now grey_door_1 is unlocked.

Then go to room_1:

Action: gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1

Now in room_1.

In room_1, the doors are purple_door_1 (to room_2) and grey_door_1 (to room_3). purple_door_1 is locked. So need to unlock it.

Go to purple_door_1 in room_1:

Action: gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2

Toggle it:

Action: toggle purple_door_1

Now purple_door_1 is unlocked.

Then go to room_2:

Action: gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1

Now in room_2. Find grey_box_1 here.

Go to grey_box_1:

Action: gotoobject grey_box_1 room_2

Now in front of grey_box_1. The goal is to have a grey box (grey_box_1) in front of me. Since I'm there, this satisfies the goal.

But wait, the problem states the goal is "There is a box v such that 'v is grey' and 'you are in front of v'". So being in front of grey_box_1 in room_2 meets this.

But wait, am I allowed to drop the blue_box_1? Because I'm holding it. The goal doesn't require holding anything, just being in front of a grey box. So I don't need to drop it. However, the action to drop is not needed here. The plan can end here as long as I'm in front of grey_box_1.

But let's check the constraints again. Are all constraints met?

- Never in room_4: Correct.

- Green_door_1 is locked in at least one state: Yes, the initial state.

- If green_door_1 is locked in any state, then hold blue_box_1 in that state or after. For the initial state, we pick up blue_box_1 later, so okay.

- Green_door_1 is not locked in at least one state: Yes, after we toggle it.

- If green_door_1 is not locked in some state, we held blue_box_1 before. Yes, because we picked it up before toggling.

So all constraints are satisfied.

Now, let's check the sequence of actions:

1. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_3
2. pick blue_box_1 room_3
3. gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4
4. toggle green_door_1 (unlocks it)
5. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1
6. toggle grey_door_1 (unlocks it)
7. gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1 (now in room_1)
8. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2
9. toggle purple_door_1 (unlocks it)
10. gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1 (now in room_2)
11. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_2

This should be the plan. Let me check if each action's preconditions are met.

1. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_3: I'm in room_3. Yes.
2. pick: in same room, not holding anything. After gotoobject, yes.
3. gotodoor green_door_1: in room_3. No blocking object. Correct.
4. toggle: in front of green_door_1. Yes.
5. gotodoor grey_door_1: in room_3. Yes.
6. toggle: in front of grey_door_1. Yes.
7. gotoroom room_3 to room_1 via grey_door_1: door is unlocked now. Yes.
8. gotodoor purple_door_1 in room_1. Yes.
9. toggle: in front of purple_door_1. Yes.
10. gotoroom room_1 to room_2 via purple_door_1 (now unlocked). Yes.
11. gotoobject grey_box_1 in room_2. Yes.

All steps are valid. The plan length is 11 actions. Is there a shorter way?

Wait, maybe after step 4 (toggling green_door_1), do I need to be in front of it? Let's see. After step 3, I'm in front of green_door_1. Toggling it requires being in front. So steps 3 and 4 are correct.

But after step 4, where am I? Still in room_3, in front of green_door_1. Then steps 5 and 6: gotodoor grey_door_1 in room_3, which is possible.

Alternatively, is there a way to avoid toggling green_door_1 if possible? But the constraints require that green_door_1 is unlocked at some point. Since initially it's locked, we have to toggle it once. So steps 3 and 4 are necessary.

But perhaps the initial constraint about green_door_1 being locked is already satisfied by the initial state, so we don't need to do anything else with it except unlocking once. Because the third constraint says that whenever it's locked, we must hold blue_box_1 in that state or after. So the initial state is already a problem unless we hold blue_box_1 later. But since we do pick it up, that's okay. So steps 3 and 4 are necessary to unlock it once, satisfying the fourth constraint.

Alternatively, if we don't toggle green_door_1 at all, then the fourth constraint (green_door_1 must be not locked in at least one state) is violated. So yes, we must toggle it once to unlock.

Thus, the plan as outlined seems correct. But let's see if we can optimize.

Wait, the problem says "provide an optimal plan, i.e., a valid plan whose length is equal or less than the length of any other valid plan."

Is there a shorter path? For example, after step 4 (toggling green_door_1), can we proceed directly to grey_door_1?

But in the current plan, after toggling green_door_1, we go to grey_door_1 and toggle it. That's correct.

Another possible optimization: when moving from room_3 to room_1 via grey_door_1, after unlocking it, we can immediately go through, which we do.

Another thing: after picking up blue_box_1, do we need to carry it all the way? The third constraint says that whenever green_door_1 is locked (including initial state), I must hold blue_box_1 at that state or after. So in the initial state, I don't hold it, but I pick it up later. So that's okay. Once I drop it, if green_door_1 is locked again, I need to have it. But in the plan, we don't lock it again. So once we unlock it, we leave it unlocked. So after step 4, green_door_1 is unlocked. The only time it's locked is the initial state and any steps before step 4. So after step 4, green_door_1 is unlocked. Thus, after picking up blue_box_1 and toggling green_door_1, can we drop it? But the third constraint requires that if green_door_1 is locked in any state, I must hold blue_box_1 in that state or after. But since after step 4, green_door_1 is unlocked, and the only locked state is the initial one. So if I drop blue_box_1 after step 4, but the initial state's requirement is satisfied because I picked it up in step 2. So maybe I can drop it.

If I can drop blue_box_1 after toggling green_door_1, that might save steps. Let's see.

After step 4: I'm in front of green_door_1, holding blue_box_1. If I drop it here, I need to be in front of an empty spot. So:

After step 4, do:

Action: gotoempty (to be in front of empty spot)
Action: drop blue_box_1 room_3

But then, when we proceed to toggle grey_door_1, etc., I'm not holding blue_box_1. However, the third constraint says that if green_door_1 is locked in any state, I must hold blue_box_1 in that state or after. The initial state is locked, and I did hold blue_box_1 in step 2, which is after the initial state. So that's okay. However, after dropping it, if there's a need to toggle green_door_1 again (to lock it), I would have to pick it up again. But in the current plan, we don't lock it again. So dropping it may be possible.

But dropping it would add steps:

Steps after 4:

5. gotoempty
6. drop blue_box_1 room_3
7. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1
8. toggle grey_door_1
9. gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1
... etc.

This adds two more steps (5 and 6), making the plan longer. So it's better to keep holding blue_box_1.

Therefore, the original plan is more optimal.

Another possible optimization: after step 7 (gotoroom to room_1), do I need to go to the purple_door_1 and unlock it, or is there another way?

Wait, the purple_door_1 is locked, so yes. So steps 8-10 are necessary.

Another thought: since I'm carrying blue_box_1, which is a box, can I use it to block a door? Not necessary here, but perhaps irrelevant.

Alternatively, after unlocking grey_door_1 and moving to room_1, maybe there's a way to unlock purple_door_1 without toggling, but no. The door is locked, so toggling is required.

So the original plan seems optimal with 11 steps. Let me check again if all constraints are met.

- Never in room_4: yes.

- green_door_1 is locked in at least one state: initial state.

- green_door_1 is not locked in at least one state: after step 4.

- For each state where green_door_1 is locked (s0), in s0 or after, holding blue_box_1: in step 2, we pick it up, which is after s0.

- When green_door_1 is unlocked (step 4), we had held blue_box_1 before (step 2).

All constraints are satisfied. The plan is valid and optimal.
