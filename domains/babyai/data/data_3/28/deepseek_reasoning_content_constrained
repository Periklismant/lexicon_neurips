Okay, let's tackle this planning problem step by step. First, I need to understand the initial state, the goal, and the constraints. 

The initial state has the agent in room_4. All doors are locked. The grey_door_1 connects room_1 and room_2, yellow_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3, green_door_1 connects room_2 and room_4, and grey_door_2 connects room_3 and room_4. The goal is to have a green door (which must be green_door_1 since that's the only green door) connecting room_4 and room_2 (which it does), be in front of it, and have it unlocked. So the main goal is to be in front of green_door_1 in room_4 (or room_2?), with it unlocked.

Wait, the goal says "there is a door d such that d is green, room_4 and room_2 are connected via d, you are in front of d, and d is not locked." Since green_door_1 connects room_2 and room_4, that's the door we need. So the agent needs to be in front of green_door_1 in either room_2 or room_4, and have it unlocked.

Constraints:

1. At some state, green_door_1 must be unlocked. But to unlock it, there must have been a previous state where grey_box_1 was in room_4. So we need to move grey_box_1 (which is initially in room_1) to room_4 at some point before unlocking green_door_1.

2. At some state, blue_box_1 must be in room_1 and the agent must be holding something. Blue_box_1 is initially in room_3, so we need to move it to room_1. Also, during that move, the agent must be holding an object.

3. At some state, either the agent is holding grey_box_1 or grey_box_2 is in room_2. Grey_box_2 is initially in room_4. So either move grey_box_2 to room_2 or carry grey_box_1.

Let's outline the steps needed.

First, the agent is in room_4. The green_door_1 is locked, connecting room_4 and room_2. To toggle it (unlock), the agent must be in front of it. But to get there, they need to navigate from room_4 to room_2 through green_door_1, but it's locked. Wait, but if the door is locked, they can't go through. Wait, the "gotodoor" action requires being in a room connected by the door and that there's no object blocking the position in front of the door. Then, after going to the door, they can toggle it (unlock), but the door is initially locked. So the toggle action would unlock it. However, the agent needs to be in front of the door to toggle it. So, since the agent is in room_4, they can go to the front of green_door_1 in room_4, but the door is locked. Then, toggle it to unlock. But wait, the constraints say that before unlocking green_door_1, grey_box_1 must have been in room_4. So first, we need to get grey_box_1 from room_1 to room_4.

So the steps would involve:

1. Moving from room_4 to room_3 via grey_door_2 (needs to unlock it first? But initially, all doors are locked. So to get from room_4 to room_3, grey_door_2 is locked. So the agent is stuck unless they can unlock doors. But how? Because to unlock a door, they need to be in front of it. But if they are in room_4, they can go to grey_door_2 (connecting room_4 and room_3) by using gotodoor. But is there an object blocking that door? The initial state doesn't mention any objects blocking doors. Wait, the preconditions for gotodoor are that (i) you are in a room connected by the door and (ii) no object is blocking the position in front of d in the current room. So the initial state doesn't mention any objects blocking doors, so it's safe to assume that all doors are not blocked. Therefore, the agent can go to grey_door_2 in room_4, then toggle it (unlock), then go through to room_3. But then, from room_3, maybe move to room_1 via yellow_door_1, which is locked. Need to unlock that as well.

But this could get complicated. Let's think about the necessary steps.

First, to move grey_box_1 from room_1 to room_4. To do that, the agent needs to go to room_1, pick up the box, and bring it back. But starting in room_4, how to get to room_1?

The rooms are connected as follows:

room_1 connects to room_2 (grey_door_1) and room_3 (yellow_door_1).

room_2 connects to room_1 and room_4 (green_door_1).

room_3 connects to room_1 (yellow_door_1) and room_4 (grey_door_2).

room_4 connects to room_2 (green_door_1) and room_3 (grey_door_2).

So from room_4, the agent can access room_2 via green_door_1 (locked) or room_3 via grey_door_2 (locked). So first, the agent needs to unlock either grey_door_2 or green_door_1. But to unlock a door, they need to be in front of it. So from room_4, they can go to grey_door_2 (since they are in room_4, which is connected via grey_door_2 to room_3). So:

Action: gotodoor grey_door_2 room_4 room_3

But first, check if the agent can do that. The preconditions for gotodoor are (i) in a room connected by the door, which they are, and (ii) no object is blocking the position. Assuming no objects are blocking, so this action is possible.

After going to the door, they can toggle it to unlock.

Then, they can go to room_3 via gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_2 (since the door is now unlocked).

Once in room_3, they can then proceed to room_1 via yellow_door_1. But yellow_door_1 is locked. So they need to unlock it.

To unlock yellow_door_1, they need to be in front of it in room_3 or room_1. Since they are in room_3, they can go to yellow_door_1 (gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1), then toggle it to unlock.

Then, they can go to room_1 via gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_1.

In room_1, pick up grey_box_1.

But to pick up the box, they need to be in front of it. So first, gotoobject grey_box_1 room_1, then pick grey_box_1 room_1.

Now, holding grey_box_1, they need to bring it back to room_4. The path back would be room_1 -> room_3 (through yellow_door_1, which is now unlocked), then room_3 -> room_4 via grey_door_2 (already unlocked). Once in room_4, drop the box.

But also, the constraint says that at some state, blue_box_1 must be in room_1 and the agent is holding something. Since blue_box_1 is in room_3, perhaps the agent can pick it up and drop it in room_1 during this process. Wait, but the agent is already carrying grey_box_1 when moving back. So maybe after dropping grey_box_1 in room_4, the agent can go back to room_3, pick up blue_box_1, take it to room_1, and drop it there. But that would add steps. Alternatively, during the initial trip to room_1, after dropping grey_box_1 in room_4, maybe the agent can go back to room_3, get blue_box_1, take it to room_1, and drop it. Let's see.

But let's not get ahead of ourselves. Let's outline the steps:

1. From room_4, go to grey_door_2.
2. Toggle grey_door_2 to unlock.
3. Go to room_3.
4. In room_3, go to yellow_door_1.
5. Toggle yellow_door_1 to unlock.
6. Go to room_1 via yellow_door_1.
7. In room_1, go to grey_box_1.
8. Pick grey_box_1.
9. Return to room_3 (through yellow_door_1).
10. From room_3, go to grey_door_2 and go back to room_4.
11. Drop grey_box_1 in room_4. Now, grey_box_1 is in room_4, satisfying the constraint that before unlocking green_door_1, this condition must have been met.

Then, the agent can proceed to unlock green_door_1. But to do that, they need to be in front of green_door_1 in room_4. So:

12. Go to green_door_1 in room_4 (gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2).
13. Toggle green_door_1 to unlock. Now, the green_door_1 is unlocked, and since grey_box_1 was in room_4 earlier (step 11), this satisfies the constraint.

Now, the goal is to be in front of green_door_1 (which we are after step 12) and it's unlocked (after step 13). So the goal is achieved after step 13. But wait, after step 12, the agent is in front of green_door_1, but it's still locked. Then step 13 toggles it to unlock. So after step 13, the agent is still in front of the door, and the door is unlocked. So that meets the goal.

But also, the constraints require:

- At some state, blue_box_1 is in room_1 and agent is holding something. So during the steps, perhaps when the agent is in room_3, they can pick up blue_box_1 and carry it to room_1. However, when the agent first goes to room_1 (step 6), they need to pick grey_box_1, so they can't carry blue_box_1 then. Maybe after dropping grey_box_1 in room_4, the agent can go back to room_3, pick blue_box_1, take it to room_1, and drop it. Let's see:

After step 11 (grey_box_1 is in room_4), the agent is in room_4. Then:

14. Go to grey_door_2 (room_4), already unlocked.
15. Go to room_3.
16. Go to blue_box_1 in room_3.
17. Pick blue_box_1.
18. Go to yellow_door_1 in room_3 (already unlocked).
19. Go to room_1.
20. Drop blue_box_1 in room_1. Now, blue_box_1 is in room_1, and during step 17-19, the agent was holding it. So that satisfies the constraint where blue_box_1 is in room_1 and the agent is holding something (during step 17-19, and after step 20, blue_box_1 is in room_1).

But this adds steps. However, the problem requires an optimal plan with minimal steps. So perhaps there's a way to combine moving grey_box_1 and blue_box_1 in the same trip.

Alternatively, maybe after picking grey_box_1 in room_1 (step 8), the agent can go to room_3, then pick blue_box_1, but they can't carry two objects. So that's not possible. Therefore, the agent needs to make two separate trips.

But that would make the plan longer. Is there a way to optimize?

Alternatively, after dropping grey_box_1 in room_4 (step 11), the agent can go back to room_3, pick blue_box_1, take it to room_1, drop it, then proceed to unlock green_door_1.

But that adds steps. Let's see how many steps that would take.

Another constraint is that at some state, either the agent is holding grey_box_1 or grey_box_2 is in room_2. Grey_box_2 is in room_4 initially. So moving grey_box_2 to room_2 would satisfy that. But moving grey_box_2 to room_2 would require going from room_4 to room_2 via green_door_1, which is locked until step 13. So after unlocking green_door_1, the agent can go to room_2 and drop grey_box_2 there. But that would require additional steps. Alternatively, if the agent carries grey_box_1 at some point (which they do during steps 8-10), then that also satisfies the constraint. Because during steps 8-10, the agent is holding grey_box_1, which satisfies the "you are holding grey_box_1" part of the constraint. So that's already covered.

So the constraint is satisfied during steps 8-10. So that's okay.

So back to the main plan. Let's outline the steps again, incorporating moving blue_box_1 to room_1.

But first, the initial plan to get grey_box_1 to room_4 and unlock green_door_1:

1. gotodoor grey_door_2 room_4 room_3
2. toggle grey_door_2
3. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_2
4. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1
5. toggle yellow_door_1
6. gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_1
7. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_1
8. pick grey_box_1 room_1
9. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3
10. gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1
11. gotodoor grey_door_2 room_3 room_4
12. gotoroom room_3 room_4 grey_door_2
13. drop grey_box_1 room_4
14. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2
15. toggle green_door_1
16. (Now, green_door_1 is unlocked, and the agent is in front of it. So the goal is achieved.)

But wait, after step 15, the agent is in front of green_door_1, which is now unlocked. So the goal is achieved here.

But we also need to satisfy the constraint that blue_box_1 is in room_1 and the agent is holding some object. So during this initial plan, when is that achieved? It isn't. So we need to add steps to move blue_box_1 to room_1.

After step 13 (grey_box_1 is in room_4), the agent is in room_4. Let's add steps:

14. gotodoor grey_door_2 room_4 room_3
15. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_2
16. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_3
17. pick blue_box_1 room_3
18. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1
19. gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_1
20. drop blue_box_1 room_1
21. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3
22. gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1
23. gotodoor grey_door_2 room_3 room_4
24. gotoroom room_3 room_4 grey_door_2
25. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2
26. toggle green_door_1

This adds a lot of steps. But the problem requires an optimal plan with the shortest possible steps. So maybe there's a more efficient way.

Alternatively, when the agent is in room_3 after step 10 (returning from room_1 to room_3 with grey_box_1), before going to room_4, can they pick up blue_box_1? But they are already holding grey_box_1, so they can't pick another object. So they have to drop grey_box_1 first, but that would require going to room_4, which might not be efficient.

Alternatively, after dropping grey_box_1 in room_4 (step 13), the agent can go back to room_3, pick blue_box_1, take it to room_1, drop it, and then proceed to unlock green_door_1. Let's count those steps:

13. drop grey_box_1 room_4
14. gotodoor grey_door_2 room_4 room_3
15. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_2
16. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_3
17. pick blue_box_1 room_3
18. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1
19. gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_1
20. drop blue_box_1 room_1
21. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3
22. gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1
23. gotodoor grey_door_2 room_3 room_4
24. gotoroom room_3 room_4 grey_door_2
25. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2
26. toggle green_door_1

This adds 14 steps, but the initial plan was 15 steps. However, maybe there's a way to combine these actions. For example, after dropping grey_box_1 in room_4, the agent can go back to room_3, get blue_box_1, and take it to room_1. Then, when going back to room_4, proceed to unlock green_door_1.

But this is making the plan longer. However, the constraints require that at least one state must have blue_box_1 in room_1 and the agent holding something. So during step 17-20, the agent is holding blue_box_1, and after step 20, blue_box_1 is in room_1. So that satisfies the constraint.

But this makes the plan longer. Is there a shorter way?

Alternatively, maybe during the initial trip to room_1, after picking grey_box_1, the agent can also pick blue_box_1. But they can't carry two objects. So that's impossible.

Another idea: after step 8 (picking grey_box_1), the agent can go to room_3, then drop grey_box_1 in room_3, pick blue_box_1, take it to room_1, drop it, then go back to room_3, pick grey_box_1 again, take it to room_4. But this adds more steps and may not be optimal.

Alternatively, perhaps the agent can unlock doors in a different order. For example, unlock green_door_1 first. But how? Because green_door_1 is in room_4 and room_2. The agent is initially in room_4. To unlock green_door_1, they need to be in front of it. So steps:

1. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2
2. toggle green_door_1 (unlock)
But wait, the constraint says that before unlocking green_door_1, grey_box_1 must have been in room_4. But initially, grey_box_1 is in room_1. So this approach violates the constraint. So cannot do that.

Thus, the only way is to first move grey_box_1 to room_4, which requires the path through room_1 -> room_3 -> room_4, unlocking doors as needed.

Therefore, the initial plan with the additional steps to move blue_box_1 to room_1 is necessary. But this makes the plan longer. However, since the problem requires an optimal plan (shortest possible), we need to check if there's a way to satisfy all constraints with fewer steps.

Let's re-examine the constraints:

- Constraint 1: green_door_1 must be unlocked at some state, and before that, grey_box_1 was in room_4.

- Constraint 2: blue_box_1 in room_1 and agent holding something at some state.

- Constraint 3: agent holds grey_box_1 or grey_box_2 is in room_2.

We need to make sure that all these are met in the plan.

Now, in the initial plan (without moving blue_box_1), steps 8-10 have the agent holding grey_box_1, which satisfies constraint 3. But constraint 2 requires blue_box_1 in room_1 and agent holding something. So that's not met. Hence, we must add steps to move blue_box_1 to room_1.

But perhaps there's a way to combine moving blue_box_1 and grey_box_1 in a single trip. For example, after moving grey_box_1 to room_4, the agent can go back to room_3, pick blue_box_1, take it to room_1, then proceed to unlock green_door_1. But that requires additional steps.

Alternatively, maybe during the initial trip to room_1 to get grey_box_1, the agent can also move blue_box_1. But since the agent can only carry one object at a time, this isn't possible. So the agent must make two trips: one for grey_box_1 and another for blue_box_1.

This seems unavoidable. So the optimal plan would involve:

- Unlocking doors to room_1 and room_3.

- Moving grey_box_1 to room_4.

- Moving blue_box_1 to room_1.

- Unlocking green_door_1.

Now, let's try to outline this:

1. From room_4, go to grey_door_2 (room_4, room_3).
2. Toggle to unlock grey_door_2.
3. Go to room_3.
4. Go to yellow_door_1 (room_3, room_1).
5. Toggle to unlock yellow_door_1.
6. Go to room_1.
7. Go to grey_box_1 and pick it up.
8. Return to room_3 via yellow_door_1.
9. Go to room_4 via grey_door_2.
10. Drop grey_box_1 in room_4. Now, constraint 1 is satisfied (grey_box_1 in room_4 before unlocking green_door_1).
11. Go back to room_3 via grey_door_2.
12. Go to blue_box_1 in room_3 and pick it up.
13. Go to room_1 via yellow_door_1.
14. Drop blue_box_1 in room_1. Now, constraint 2 is satisfied when the agent was holding blue_box_1 (steps 12-14).
15. Return to room_3 via yellow_door_1.
16. Go to room_4 via grey_door_2.
17. Go to green_door_1 (room_4, room_2).
18. Toggle to unlock green_door_1. Now, the agent is in front of green_door_1, which is unlocked. Goal achieved.

This plan has 18 steps. Is there a way to shorten it?

Wait, after step 10 (grey_box_1 is in room_4), the agent is in room_4. Then steps 11-14 involve going back to room_3, picking blue_box_1, taking it to room_1, and dropping it. Then steps 15-16 return to room_4. Then steps 17-18 unlock green_door_1.

But maybe after dropping blue_box_1 in room_1 (step 14), the agent can go directly from room_1 to room_2 via grey_door_1 (which connects room_1 and room_2). But grey_door_1 is initially locked. To unlock it, the agent needs to be in front of it. But room_1 is connected to room_2 via grey_door_1. So from room_1, the agent can go to grey_door_1, unlock it, then go to room_2. From room_2, they can use green_door_1 to get back to room_4. But this might save steps.

Let's explore this alternative:

After step 14 (blue_box_1 in room_1, agent in room_1):

15. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2
16. toggle grey_door_1 (unlock)
17. gotoroom room_1 room_2 grey_door_1
18. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4
19. toggle green_door_1 (unlock)
20. gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1

But step 20 would place the agent in room_4, in front of green_door_1, which is now unlocked. Wait, no: gotoroom moves them from room_2 to room_4 via green_door_1. After step 19, green_door_1 is unlocked, so step 20 would be possible. But after step 19, the agent is in front of green_door_1 in room_2. Then, step 20 is gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1, which moves them to room_4. But the goal requires being in front of green_door_1. So after step 19, the agent is in front of green_door_1 in room_2, and the door is unlocked. So that satisfies the goal: there exists a door d (green_door_1) connecting room_4 and room_2, in front of d (in room_2), and d is not locked. So step 19 achieves the goal.

But the agent is in room_2. Wait, the goal says "you are in front of d", which is green_door_1. So after step 19 (toggle), the agent is still in front of green_door_1 in room_2, and the door is now unlocked. So that satisfies the goal. So steps 15-19 could be:

15. In room_1 after dropping blue_box_1:

15. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2
16. toggle grey_door_1
17. gotoroom room_1 room_2 grey_door_1 (now in room_2)
18. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4
19. toggle green_door_1 (now unlocked)
Now, the agent is in front of green_door_1 in room_2, and it's unlocked. So the goal is achieved here.

This would be steps 1-14, then steps 15-19 as above. Let's count:

Original steps 1-14 (moving grey_box_1 and blue_box_1):

1. gotodoor grey_door_2 room_4 room_3
2. toggle grey_door_2
3. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_2
4. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1
5. toggle yellow_door_1
6. gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_1
7. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_1
8. pick grey_box_1 room_1
9. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3
10. gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1
11. gotodoor grey_door_2 room_3 room_4
12. gotoroom room_3 room_4 grey_door_2
13. drop grey_box_1 room_4
14. gotodoor grey_door_2 room_4 room_3
15. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_2
16. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_3
17. pick blue_box_1 room_3
18. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1
19. gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_1
20. drop blue_box_1 room_1
21. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2
22. toggle grey_door_1
23. gotoroom room_1 room_2 grey_door_1
24. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4
25. toggle green_door_1

Now, step 25 satisfies the goal. Total steps: 25.

But this is longer than the previous approach. Alternatively, after dropping blue_box_1 in room_1 (step 20), the agent can go to grey_door_1 in room_1, unlock it, go to room_2, then toggle green_door_1 there. Let's see:

After step 20 (blue_box_1 in room_1):

21. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2
22. toggle grey_door_1
23. gotoroom room_1 room_2 grey_door_1
24. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4
25. toggle green_door_1

Now, in step 25, the agent is in front of green_door_1 in room_2, which is now unlocked. So goal achieved. This is 25 steps total. But maybe there's a way to optimize.

Wait, when the agent is in room_4 after step 13 (dropping grey_box_1), instead of going back to room_3 to get blue_box_1, maybe there's a different path. For example, from room_4, go to green_door_1, but it's locked. But since grey_box_1 is now in room_4, the agent can toggle green_door_1. But to toggle, they need to be in front of it. So:

13. drop grey_box_1 room_4
14. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2
15. toggle green_door_1 (now unlocked)
But this violates the constraint because before unlocking green_door_1, grey_box_1 must have been in room_4. But step 13 drops grey_box_1 in room_4, so step 14-15 are allowed. Then, after unlocking, the agent is in front of green_door_1 in room_4, which is unlocked. So the goal is achieved in step 15.

But this skips moving blue_box_1 to room_1, which is needed for constraint 2. So this plan doesn't satisfy all constraints. Therefore, we need to handle that.

Alternatively, perhaps the agent can move blue_box_1 after unlocking green_door_1. But then, they have to ensure that during the plan, there's a state where blue_box_1 is in room_1 and the agent is holding something.

But if the agent unlocks green_door_1 first (step 15), then they can go to room_2 via green_door_1, then to room_1 via grey_door_1 (if they unlock it). But this requires additional steps.

Alternatively, after step 15 (unlocking green_door_1), the agent can go to room_2, then to room_1 via grey_door_1 (which is locked). To unlock grey_door_1, they need to be in room_1 or room_2. So:

15. toggle green_door_1 (now unlocked)
16. gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_1
17. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_1
18. toggle grey_door_1 (unlock)
19. gotoroom room_2 room_1 grey_door_1
20. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_3 (wait, blue_box_1 is in room_3, but the agent is in room_1. So need to go back to room_3. This would require passing through room_1 to room_3 via yellow_door_1 (already unlocked). So:

20. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3
21. gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1
22. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_3
23. pick blue_box_1 room_3
24. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1
25. gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_1
26. drop blue_box_1 room_1

But this adds many steps. So this approach makes the plan even longer.

Alternatively, perhaps the agent can move blue_box_1 to room_1 before unlocking green_door_1, but that requires the initial path through room_3 and room_1.

It seems that the most efficient way is to handle moving grey_box_1 and blue_box_1 in separate trips, which unfortunately adds steps. But the problem requires an optimal plan. So perhaps there's a way to combine these actions.

Wait, when the agent is in room_3 after step 10 (returning from room_1 with grey_box_1), they can drop grey_box_1 in room_3, pick blue_box_1, take it to room_1, then come back to room_3, pick grey_box_1 again, and take it to room_4. This way, they move both boxes in one trip. But this involves more steps but maybe fewer than two separate trips.

Let's outline this:

1. gotodoor grey_door_2 room_4 room_3
2. toggle grey_door_2
3. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_2
4. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1
5. toggle yellow_door_1
6. gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_1
7. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_1
8. pick grey_box_1 room_1
9. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3
10. gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1
11. drop grey_box_1 room_3
12. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_3
13. pick blue_box_1 room_3
14. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1
15. gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_1
16. drop blue_box_1 room_1
17. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3
18. gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1
19. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_3
20. pick grey_box_1 room_3
21. gotodoor grey_door_2 room_3 room_4
22. gotoroom room_3 room_4 grey_door_2
23. drop grey_box_1 room_4
24. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2
25. toggle green_door_1

Now, this plan has 25 steps, but combines the movement of both boxes. However, this is longer than the previous approach. The initial plan to move grey_box_1 only was 13 steps, but adding blue_box_1's movement makes it 25. However, maybe there's a more optimal path.

Alternatively, after step 8 (picking grey_box_1 in room_1), the agent goes to room_3, drops grey_box_1 there, picks blue_box_1, takes it to room_1, drops it, then picks grey_box_1 again and takes it to room_4. This way, the agent moves both boxes with fewer steps.

Let's try:

1. gotodoor grey_door_2 room_4 room_3
2. toggle grey_door_2
3. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_2
4. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1
5. toggle yellow_door_1
6. gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_1
7. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_1
8. pick grey_box_1 room_1
9. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3
10. gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1
11. drop grey_box_1 room_3
12. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_3
13. pick blue_box_1 room_3
14. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1
15. gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_1
16. drop blue_box_1 room_1
17. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3
18. gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1
19. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_3
20. pick grey_box_1 room_3
21. gotodoor grey_door_2 room_3 room_4
22. gotoroom room_3 room_4 grey_door_2
23. drop grey_box_1 room_4
24. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2
25. toggle green_door_1

This is 25 steps. But is there a way to reduce steps?

For example, after step 11 (drop grey_box_1 in room_3), the agent can immediately pick blue_box_1 (steps 12-13), take it to room_1 (14-16), then return to room_3 (17-18), pick grey_box_1 again (19-20), and take it to room_4 (21-23). This seems unavoidable.

Alternatively, maybe the agent can drop grey_box_1 in room_3, pick blue_box_1, take it to room_1, and then use another path to get back to room_4. For example, from room_1, go to room_2 via grey_door_1 (if unlocked), then to room_4 via green_door_1 (which is not yet unlocked). But this requires unlocking grey_door_1 and green_door_1, which adds steps.

Alternatively, after dropping blue_box_1 in room_1 (step 16), the agent can go to room_2 via grey_door_1 (if unlocked), then to room_4 via green_door_1 (unlocked later). But this might not save steps.

This seems to be the most efficient way given the constraints. So the final plan would include moving both boxes and unlocking the necessary doors, leading to the goal.

But given the time constraints, perhaps the optimal plan requires 25 steps. However, perhaps there's a smarter way.

Wait, after step 23 (drop grey_box_1 in room_4), the agent can go directly to green_door_1 in room_4 and toggle it. So steps 24-25:

24. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2
25. toggle green_door_1

Thus, steps 1-25 as above.

But this meets all constraints:

- grey_box_1 is in room_4 before unlocking green_door_1 (step 23 before 25).

- blue_box_1 is in room_1 (step 16), and the agent was holding it (steps 13-16).

- The agent was holding grey_box_1 (steps 8-11, 20-23), satisfying the third constraint.

So this plan meets all constraints and the goal.

But the problem states to provide an optimal plan with minimal steps. However, this plan is quite long. Let's think again.

Alternative approach:

Maybe the agent can use the fact that grey_box_2 is in room_4. The third constraint requires that either the agent holds grey_box_1 or grey_box_2 is in room_2. So instead of moving grey_box_1, the agent can move grey_box_2 to room_2. This would satisfy the third constraint without needing to handle grey_box_1. But then, the first constraint requires that before unlocking green_door_1, grey_box_1 must have been in room_4. But if the agent moves grey_box_2 instead, this wouldn't satisfy the first constraint. So the first constraint is about grey_box_1, so moving grey_box_1 is mandatory.

Thus, the agent must move grey_box_1 to room_4, which involves the earlier steps.

So the plan must include moving grey_box_1 to room_4 and blue_box_1 to room_1, and unlocking green_door_1.

Thus, the optimal plan is likely the one outlined with 25 steps. However, maybe there's a shorter path.

Wait, maybe after moving grey_box_1 to room_4 (step 23), the agent can go to room_2 via green_door_1 (which is still locked), but they can't. So they have to unlock green_door_1 from room_4.

So after step 23:

24. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2
25. toggle green_door_1

Thus, steps 1-25 as before.

But how many steps is that? Let's count:

1. gotodoor grey_door_2 room_4 room_3
2. toggle grey_door_2
3. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_2
4. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1
5. toggle yellow_door_1
6. gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_1
7. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_1
8. pick grey_box_1 room_1
9. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3
10. gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1
11. drop grey_box_1 room_3
12. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_3
13. pick blue_box_1 room_3
14. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1
15. gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_1
16. drop blue_box_1 room_1
17. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3
18. gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1
19. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_3
20. pick grey_box_1 room_3
21. gotodoor grey_door_2 room_3 room_4
22. gotoroom room_3 room_4 grey_door_2
23. drop grey_box_1 room_4
24. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2
25. toggle green_door_1

Yes, 25 steps. But this seems too long. Maybe there's a way to optimize.

Wait, after step 16 (blue_box_1 dropped in room_1), the agent is in room_1. Instead of going back to room_3, they can go to room_2 via grey_door_1, but it's locked. So:

17. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2
18. toggle grey_door_1
19. gotoroom room_1 room_2 grey_door_1
20. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4
21. toggle green_door_1

But this skips moving grey_box_1 to room_4. So this would violate the first constraint, as grey_box_1 is still in room_3. So this is not allowed.

Thus, the only way is to return to room_3, pick grey_box_1, and take it to room_4.

Thus, the plan remains at 25 steps. However, given the problem's requirement for an optimal plan, perhaps there's a shorter path that I'm missing.

Let's think differently: can the agent satisfy the third constraint (holding grey_box_1 or grey_box_2 in room_2) by moving grey_box_2 to room_2 instead of holding grey_box_1? grey_box_2 is initially in room_4. So if the agent can move grey_box_2 to room_2, that would satisfy the third constraint. This would avoid needing to carry grey_box_1, but the first constraint still requires grey_box_1 to be in room_4 before unlocking green_door_1.

But grey_box_1 is in room_1 initially. So moving grey_box_1 to room_4 is still required for the first constraint. However, the third constraint can be satisfied either by holding grey_box_1 or moving grey_box_2 to room_2. So if we move grey_box_2 to room_2, we can satisfy the third constraint without needing to carry grey_box_1. But moving grey_box_2 would require taking it from room_4 to room_2. But how?

Since the agent is in room_4 initially, they can pick grey_box_2 and move it. But to get to room_2, they need to go through green_door_1, which is locked. So they need to unlock green_door_1 first. But unlocking green_door_1 requires grey_box_1 to have been in room_4 earlier. So if the agent first moves grey_box_1 to room_4, then unlocks green_door_1, then moves grey_box_2 to room_2, that could work. But this might be more efficient.

Let's outline this approach:

1. Move grey_box_1 to room_4 (as before, steps 1-13).

2. Unlock green_door_1 (steps 14-15).

3. Move grey_box_2 to room_2 (pick it in room_4, go to room_2 via green_door_1, drop it).

This would satisfy the third constraint (grey_box_2 in room_2), and the first constraint is already satisfied.

But also, the second constraint requires blue_box_1 in room_1 and the agent holding something. So we still need to handle that.

But if the agent moves grey_box_2 to room_2, they don't need to hold grey_box_1, but they still need to move blue_box_1.

So combining these steps:

Plan:

1. gotodoor grey_door_2 room_4 room_3
2. toggle grey_door_2
3. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_2
4. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1
5. toggle yellow_door_1
6. gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_1
7. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_1
8. pick grey_box_1 room_1
9. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3
10. gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1
11. gotodoor grey_door_2 room_3 room_4
12. gotoroom room_3 room_4 grey_door_2
13. drop grey_box_1 room_4
14. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2
15. toggle green_door_1
16. gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_1
17. gotoobject grey_box_2 room_4
18. pick grey_box_2 room_4
19. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2
20. gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_1
21. drop grey_box_2 room_2

Now, the third constraint is satisfied (grey_box_2 in room_2). Now, the second constraint: blue_box_1 in room_1 and agent holding something. The agent has to move blue_box_1 to room_1.

From step 21, agent is in room_2. To get to room_1, they need to go via grey_door_1, which is locked. So:

22. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_1
23. toggle grey_door_1
24. gotoroom room_2 room_1 grey_door_1
25. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3
26. gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1
27. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_3
28. pick blue_box_1 room_3
29. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1
30. gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_1
31. drop blue_box_1 room_1

This adds 11 steps, making the total steps 31, which is even longer. Thus, this approach is worse.

Therefore, the original approach of moving both boxes is better but still lengthy. However, given the constraints, it seems unavoidable. But perhaps there's a way to optimize further.

Wait, after step 13 (grey_box_1 in room_4), the agent can proceed to unlock green_door_1 immediately:

14. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2
15. toggle green_door_1 (now unlocked)
Now, the agent is in front of green_door_1 in room_4, which is unlocked. Goal achieved. But we need to satisfy the other constraints.

But the second constraint requires blue_box_1 in room_1 and agent holding something. So the agent must move blue_box_1 to room_1.

But after step 15, the agent is in room_4, in front of green_door_1. Then, they can go to room_2 via green_door_1 (step 16), then to room_1 via grey_door_1 (which is locked). To unlock grey_door_1:

16. gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_1
17. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_1
18. toggle grey_door_1
19. gotoroom room_2 room_1 grey_door_1
20. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3
21. gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1
22. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_3
23. pick blue_box_1 room_3
24. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1
25. gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_1
26. drop blue_box_1 room_1

Now, during steps 23-26, the agent is holding blue_box_1 and drops it in room_1. This satisfies the second constraint. Also, the third constraint is satisfied when grey_box_1 was in room_4 (step 13), but the agent hasn't held grey_box_1 since step 13. However, the third constraint requires that at some state, either the agent holds grey_box_1 or grey_box_2 is in room_2. In this plan, the agent hasn't moved grey_box_2, so they must have held grey_box_1 during steps 8-13. So step 8-13: agent was holding grey_box_1, which satisfies the third constraint. 

So this plan has 26 steps. But the goal is achieved at step 15, but the constraints require additional steps. However, the problem requires that the plan brings about the goal and satisfies all constraints. So the agent must perform all necessary actions to meet the constraints, even after achieving the goal. But the goal is achieved early, but the constraints must be met at some state in the plan. 

Wait, the constraints must hold in at least one state in the plan. So even if after achieving the goal, the agent performs actions that meet the constraints, but the plan is valid as long as all constraints are met in at least one state.

So perhaps the agent can achieve the goal first, then move blue_box_1 to room_1. Let's see:

1. gotodoor grey_door_2 room_4 room_3
2. toggle grey_door_2
3. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_2
4. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1
5. toggle yellow_door_1
6. gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_1
7. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_1
8. pick grey_box_1 room_1
9. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3
10. gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1
11. gotodoor grey_door_2 room_3 room_4
12. gotoroom room_3 room_4 grey_door_2
13. drop grey_box_1 room_4
14. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2
15. toggle green_door_1 (goal achieved)
16. gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_1
17. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_1
18. toggle grey_door_1
19. gotoroom room_2 room_1 grey_door_1
20. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3
21. gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1
22. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_3
23. pick blue_box_1 room_3
24. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1
25. gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_1
26. drop blue_box_1 room_1

This plan has 26 steps and meets all constraints:

- green_door_1 is unlocked (step 15) after grey_box_1 was in room_4 (step 13).

- blue_box_1 is in room_1 (step 26) and agent was holding it (steps 23-25).

- agent held grey_box_1 (steps 8-13).

Thus, this plan is valid and meets all constraints and the goal. But it's still 26 steps. However, maybe there's a way to reorder steps to achieve this in fewer steps.

Alternatively, after achieving the goal (step 15), the agent can proceed to room_2, unlock grey_door_1, go to room_1, then to room_3, pick blue_box_1, and drop it in room_1. This requires steps after the goal is achieved.

But the problem requires that the plan achieves the goal. So after step 15, the goal is achieved, but the agent needs to continue to meet the constraints. However, the constraints require that certain conditions are met in at least one state during the plan. So even if those states are after the goal is achieved, it's still valid. 

But perhaps the agent can achieve the constraints before achieving the goal. For example, moving blue_box_1 to room_1 before unlocking green_door_1.

But this would require more steps before step 15. Let's see:

After moving grey_box_1 to room_4 (step 13), the agent goes back to room_3, picks blue_box_1, takes it to room_1, then returns to room_4 to unlock green_door_1. Let's outline:

13. drop grey_box_1 room_4
14. gotodoor grey_door_2 room_4 room_3
15. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_2
16. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_3
17. pick blue_box_1 room_3
18. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1
19. gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_1
20. drop blue_box_1 room_1
21. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3
22. gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1
23. gotodoor grey_door_2 room_3 room_4
24. gotoroom room_3 room_4 grey_door_2
25. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2
26. toggle green_door_1

Now, this plan has 26 steps. But during steps 17-20, the agent is holding blue_box_1, satisfying constraint 2. The goal is achieved at step 26. So this plan meets all constraints and the goal. Is this shorter than the previous approach? It's 26 steps, but perhaps the order is better.

But how many steps are required to achieve the goal and meet all constraints? It seems that given the constraints, the minimal number of steps is around 25-26. However, the problem states that the agent must provide an optimal plan with minimal steps. But perhaps there's a way to optimize further.

Wait, after step 13 (grey_box_1 in room_4), the agent is in room_4. They can then proceed to unlock green_door_1 (steps 14-15). Then, go to room_2, unlock grey_door_1, go to room_1, then to room_3, pick blue_box_1, take it to room_1, and drop it. This would be:

14. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2
15. toggle green_door_1
16. gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_1
17. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_1
18. toggle grey_door_1
19. gotoroom room_2 room_1 grey_door_1
20. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3
21. gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1
22. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_3
23. pick blue_box_1 room_3
24. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1
25. gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_1
26. drop blue_box_1 room_1

This plan has 26 steps. The constraints are met as follows:

- green_door_1 unlocked after grey_box_1 in room_4 (steps 15 after 13).

- blue_box_1 in room_1 and agent holding it (steps 23-25).

- agent held grey_box_1 (steps 8-13).

This plan also has 26 steps. So regardless of the approach, it seems that around 25-26 steps are needed. However, given the problem's requirement for an optimal plan, perhaps there's a shorter way that I'm missing.

Alternatively, perhaps the agent can use the fact that after moving grey_box_1 to room_4 (step 13), they can go directly to room_2 via green_door_1 (once unlocked), then to room_1 via grey_door_1, then to room_3 via yellow_door_1, pick blue_box_1, and take it to room_1.

But this requires unlocking green_door_1 and grey_door_1, and moving through multiple rooms. 

Alternatively, after step 13, the agent unlocks green_door_1 (steps 14-15). Then:

16. gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_1
17. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_1
18. toggle grey_door_1
19. gotoroom room_2 room_1 grey_door_1
20. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3
21. gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1
22. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_3
23. pick blue_box_1 room_3
24. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1
25. gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_1
26. drop blue_box_1 room_1

This is steps 1-26. But again, 26 steps.

After careful consideration, I think the initial plan with 25 steps is the most efficient way to meet all constraints and the goal. However, upon reviewing the constraints again, I notice that the second constraint requires that at some state, blue_box_1 is in room_1 and the agent is holding some object. This can be achieved when the agent is carrying blue_box_1 and is in room_1, even before dropping it. So during steps 23-24 in the initial plan, when the agent is holding blue_box_1 and in room_1, that state satisfies the constraint. Therefore, the agent doesn't need to drop blue_box_1 in room_1; however, the effect of the drop action is that blue_box_1 is in room_1, so the drop is necessary. But the constraint is about at least one state, so during the time the agent is holding blue_box_1 in room_1 (before dropping), the condition is met. But the agent can't be in room_1 and holding blue_box_1 without having picked it up in room_3 and moved it there. So the agent must have picked it up in room_3 and brought it to room_1, which requires the drop action. Therefore, the steps are necessary.

Given all this, the optimal plan is likely the following, with 25 steps. However, to save time and given the complexity, I'll proceed to write the final answer based on the initial plan that satisfies all constraints and the goal.
