Let's analyze the problem and plan a solution:

**Initial State:**
- You are in room_4
- Objects in room_1: grey_box_1
- Objects in room_2: yellow_box_1
- Objects in room_3: blue_box_1, purple_box_1, blue_box_2, purple_ball_1
- Objects in room_4: grey_ball_1, grey_box_2
- All doors are locked: grey_door_1 (room_1-room_2), yellow_door_1 (room_1-room_3), green_door_1 (room_2-room_4), grey_door_2 (room_3-room_4)
- You have visited room_4 only
- You are not holding any object

**Goal:**
- Be in front of green_door_1 connecting room_4 and room_2, and green_door_1 is unlocked.

**Constraints:**
1. At some point, green_door_1 must be unlocked
2. Before green_door_1 is unlocked, grey_box_1 must be in room_4
3. At some point, blue_box_1 must be in room_1 while you are holding some object
4. At some point, you must either be holding grey_box_1 or grey_box_2 must be in room_2

Let's think about a plan:

First, I need to get grey_box_1 from room_1 to room_4, which requires traversing through the rooms. But all doors are locked, so I need to unlock them.

I'll start by unlocking grey_door_2 between room_3 and room_4, which I can access since I'm in room_4:
1. Go to grey_door_2 in room_4
2. Toggle grey_door_2 to unlock it
3. Go to room_3 through grey_door_2

Now I need to unlock yellow_door_1 between room_1 and room_3:
4. Go to yellow_door_1 in room_3
5. Toggle yellow_door_1 to unlock it
6. Go to room_1 through yellow_door_1

Now I can get grey_box_1:
7. Go to grey_box_1 in room_1
8. Pick grey_box_1
9. Go to yellow_door_1 in room_1
10. Go to room_3 through yellow_door_1

To satisfy the third constraint, we need blue_box_1 in room_1 while holding some object. blue_box_1 is initially in room_3, and I'm currently holding grey_box_1, so:
11. Go to blue_box_1 in room_3
12. Go to yellow_door_1 in room_3
13. Go to room_1 through yellow_door_1
14. Go to empty position
15. Drop grey_box_1 (this satisfies constraint 3 as blue_box_1 is in room_1 and I'm holding grey_box_1)
16. Pick blue_box_1

Now I need to go back to room_3 and then to room_4 to put grey_box_1 there:
17. Go to yellow_door_1 in room_1
18. Go to room_3 through yellow_door_1
19. Go to grey_door_2 in room_3
20. Go to room_4 through grey_door_2
21. Go to empty position
22. Drop blue_box_1
23. Go to grey_door_2 in room_4
24. Go to room_3 through grey_door_2
25. Go to yellow_door_1 in room_3
26. Go to room_1 through yellow_door_1
27. Go to grey_box_1 in room_1
28. Pick grey_box_1
29. Go to yellow_door_1 in room_1
30. Go to room_3 through yellow_door_1
31. Go to grey_door_2 in room_3
32. Go to room_4 through grey_door_2
33. Go to empty position
34. Drop grey_box_1 (now grey_box_1 is in room_4, satisfying the second constraint)

Now I need to unlock green_door_1 and be in front of it:
35. Go to green_door_1 in room_4
36. Toggle green_door_1 to unlock it (satisfying constraint 1)

This also satisfies the goal, as I'm now in front of green_door_1, which is unlocked.

Wait, I need to recheck the constraints:
1. "green_door_1 is not locked" must hold in at least one state - satisfied by step 36
2. Before "green_door_1 is not locked", "grey_box_1 is in room_4" must be true - satisfied by steps 33-34
3. "blue_box_1 is in room_1 AND you are holding some object" must hold in at least one state - this isn't satisfied by our plan yet.
4. At some point, either "you are holding grey_box_1" OR "grey_box_2 is in room_2" must be true - satisfied by steps 27-28 because I will be holding grey_box_1.

I just realized I have a problem with constraint 3. In my current plan, blue_box_1 and I are both in room_1, but I'm not holding an object at that point.

Let me revise the plan:

I'll start from room_4, unlock grey_door_2, go to room_3, pick up blue_box_1, unlock yellow_door_1, go to room_1 while holding blue_box_1, then continue with the rest of the plan.

Revised plan:
1. Go to grey_door_2 in room_4
2. Toggle grey_door_2 to unlock it
3. Go to room_3 through grey_door_2
4. Go to blue_box_1 in room_3
5. Pick blue_box_1 (now holding blue_box_1)
6. Go to yellow_door_1 in room_3
7. Toggle yellow_door_1 to unlock it
8. Go to room_1 through yellow_door_1 (now in room_1 holding blue_box_1, which satisfies constraint 3)
9. Go to empty position
10. Drop blue_box_1 (now blue_box_1 is in room_1)
11. Go to grey_box_1 in room_1
12. Pick grey_box_1 (now holding grey_box_1, which contributes to satisfying constraint 4)
13. Go to yellow_door_1 in room_1
14. Go to room_3 through yellow_door_1
15. Go to grey_door_2 in room_3
16. Go to room_4 through grey_door_2
17. Go to empty position
18. Drop grey_box_1 (now grey_box_1 is in room_4, satisfying the prerequisite for constraint 2)
19. Go to green_door_1 in room_4
20. Toggle green_door_1 to unlock it (satisfying constraint 1 and now green_door_1 is unlocked)

This plan should satisfy all constraints and the goal.

But wait - there's a potential issue. I'm not sure if I can directly go to green_door_1 in room_4 based on the preconditions of the goto door action. Let me check that again.

The "gotodoor d r1 r2" action requires:
- You are in a room which door d is connecting with another room
- There is no object blocking the position in front of d in the room you are currently in

Since I'm in room_4 and green_door_1 connects room_4 and room_2, this should be fine as long as there are no objects blocking it. The problem doesn't state any objects are blocking doors, so this should work.

Let me finalize the plan:

1. gotodoor grey_door_2 room_4 room_3
2. toggle grey_door_2
3. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_2
4. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_3
5. pick blue_box_1 room_3
6. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1
7. toggle yellow_door_1
8. gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_1
9. gotoempty
10. drop blue_box_1 room_1
11. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_1
12. pick grey_box_1 room_1
13. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3
14. gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1
15. gotodoor grey_door_2 room_3 room_4
16. gotoroom room_3 room_4 grey_door_2
17. gotoempty
18. drop grey_box_1 room_4
19. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2
20. toggle green_door_1

That should satisfy all the constraints and achieve the goal.

On second thought, let me double-check if I've fully addressed constraint 4, which says "At some point, you must either be holding grey_box_1 or grey_box_2 must be in room_2".

In my plan, I'm holding grey_box_1 from steps 12-18, so that satisfies constraint 4. But I'm wondering if I can optimize the plan further by considering the alternative (moving grey_box_2 to room_2).

Currently, grey_box_2 is in room_4, and I would need to:
1. Pick up grey_box_2 in room_4
2. Go to green_door_1 in room_4
3. Unlock green_door_1
4. Go to room_2 through green_door_1
5. Drop grey_box_2 in room_2

But this would require unlocking green_door_1 before moving grey_box_1 to room_4, which would violate constraint 2. So my original plan is more suitable.

Let me do one final check of the constraints:
1. "green_door_1 is not locked" must hold in at least one state - satisfied by step 20
2. Before "green_door_1 is not locked", "grey_box_1 is in room_4" must be true - satisfied by step 18, which comes before step 20
3. "blue_box_1 is in room_1 AND you are holding some object" must hold in at least one state - satisfied at step 8, when I'm in room_1 and holding blue_box_1
4. At some point, either "you are holding grey_box_1" OR "grey_box_2 is in room_2" must be true - satisfied by steps 12-18 when I'm holding grey_box_1

The plan is good. Here's the finalized plan:

1. gotodoor grey_door_2 room_4 room_3
2. toggle grey_door_2
3. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_2
4. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_3
5. pick blue_box_1 room_3
6. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1
7. toggle yellow_door_1
8. gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_1
9. gotoempty
10. drop blue_box_1 room_1
11. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_1
12. pick grey_box_1 room_1
13. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3
14. gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1
15. gotodoor grey_door_2 room_3 room_4
16. gotoroom room_3 room_4 grey_door_2
17. gotoempty
18. drop grey_box_1 room_4
19. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2
20. toggle green_door_1

Actually, I'm not positive I'm satisfying constraint 3 properly. Let me double check:

"The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'The following conditions are all true: "blue_box_1 is in room_1", "you are holding some object"'"

When I'm in room_1 after step 8, I'm holding blue_box_1. But the constraint requires blue_box_1 to be in room_1 while I'm holding some object. These can't be true at the same time because if I'm holding blue_box_1, it's not in room_1.

Let me revise the plan:

1. I'll first get blue_box_1 to room_1
2. Then pick up another object (like grey_box_1) while in room_1, thus satisfying constraint 3
3. Then proceed with the rest of the plan

Revised plan:
1. gotodoor grey_door_2 room_4 room_3
2. toggle grey_door_2
3. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_2
4. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_3
5. pick blue_box_1 room_3
6. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1
7. toggle yellow_door_1
8. gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_1
9. gotoempty
10. drop blue_box_1 room_1 (now blue_box_1 is in room_1)
11. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_1
12. pick grey_box_1 room_1 (now holding grey_box_1 while blue_box_1 is in room_1, satisfying constraint 3)
13. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3
14. gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1
15. gotodoor grey_door_2 room_3 room_4
16. gotoroom room_3 room_4 grey_door_2
17. gotoempty
18. drop grey_box_1 room_4 (now grey_box_1 is in room_4, satisfying the prerequisite for constraint 2)
19. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2
20. toggle green_door_1 (satisfying constraint 1 and now green_door_1 is unlocked, which is the goal)

This plan should satisfy all the constraints and achieve the goal.

I just realized I'm mistaken about the meaning of constraint 3. It says "blue_box_1 is in room_1" AND "you are holding some object". It doesn't say I have to be holding blue_box_1; I just need to be holding some object while blue_box_1 is in room_1.

So step 12 of my revised plan, where I pick up grey_box_1 while blue_box_1 is in room_1, does satisfy constraint 3.

Let me review the whole plan once more:

1. gotodoor grey_door_2 room_4 room_3
2. toggle grey_door_2
3. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_2
4. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_3
5. pick blue_box_1 room_3
6. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1
7. toggle yellow_door_1
8. gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_1
9. gotoempty
10. drop blue_box_1 room_1
11. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_1
12. pick grey_box_1 room_1 (satisfies constraint 3 and contributes to constraint 4)
13. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3
14. gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1
15. gotodoor grey_door_2 room_3 room_4
16. gotoroom room_3 room_4 grey_door_2
17. gotoempty
18. drop grey_box_1 room_4 (satisfies the prerequisite for constraint 2)
19. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2
20. toggle green_door_1 (satisfies constraint 1 and the goal)

All constraints are satisfied and the goal is achieved, so I'm confident this plan will work.

Actually, I think I need to make a small adjustment. When I toggle green_door_1, it becomes unlocked, but the goal says I need to be in front of the door when it's unlocked. I will be in front of it since I use the gotodoor action, so that should be fine.

Let's double check the goal again:
"There is a door d such that "The following conditions are all true: "d is green", "room_4 and room_2 are connected via d", "you are in front of d", "d is not locked"""

After step 20, I toggle green_door_1, which unlocks it. I will still be in front of it after toggling, and it connects room_4 and room_2, which is where I am. So this satisfies the goal.

The plan is good to go.
