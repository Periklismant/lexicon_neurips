Let me break down the planning problem and find an optimal solution.

Initial state:
- We are in room_4.
- The blue boxes we need are in room_1 (blue_box_1) and room_3 (blue_box_2).
- All doors are locked.
- We're not holding any objects.
- Room connections: 
  - blue_door_1 connects room_1 and room_2
  - green_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3
  - purple_door_1 connects room_2 and room_4
  - red_door_1 connects room_3 and room_4

Goal:
- Hold a blue box.

Constraints:
1. red_door_1 must always be locked.
2. We must at some point be either in front of red_box_1 or in room_2.
3. We must at some point hold some object.
4. Before holding any object, we must either have purple_box_1 in room_4 or be in room_1.

Let's plan:

First, the constraint about red_door_1 being locked means we cannot use that door to move between room_3 and room_4. We'll need another path.

The constraint that requires us to either have purple_box_1 in room_4 or be in room_1 before holding any object limits our approach. We either need to move purple_box_1 to room_4 or go to room_1 before picking up any object.

Since our goal is to hold a blue box (either blue_box_1 from room_1 or blue_box_2 from room_3), and given the constraints, it seems reasonable to aim for blue_box_1 in room_1.

Current location: room_4
Target location: room_1
Available paths: 
- room_4 -> room_2 (via purple_door_1) -> room_1 (via blue_door_1)
- room_4 -> room_3 (via red_door_1, but this must remain locked) -> room_1 (via green_door_1)

Since red_door_1 must stay locked, we'll use the first path.

Here's a plan:

1. Go to and unlock purple_door_1 to go from room_4 to room_2.
2. Go to and unlock blue_door_1 to go from room_2 to room_1.
3. Pick up blue_box_1 in room_1.

Let's check if this satisfies the constraints:
- red_door_1 remains locked: ✓
- We'll be in room_2 during our journey: ✓
- We'll hold blue_box_1 at the end: ✓
- Before holding any object, we'll be in room_1: ✓

Now, let's formalize the actions:

1. From room_4, go to purple_door_1 that connects to room_2.
2. Unlock purple_door_1.
3. Go to room_2 from room_4 via purple_door_1.
4. Go to blue_door_1 that connects room_2 to room_1.
5. Unlock blue_door_1.
6. Go to room_1 from room_2 via blue_door_1.
7. Go to blue_box_1 in room_1.
8. Pick up blue_box_1.

Let's write this out in the required format:

1. `gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_2` - Go to purple_door_1 that connects room_4 and room_2.
2. `toggle purple_door_1` - Unlock purple_door_1.
3. `gotoroom room_4 room_2 purple_door_1` - Go to room_2 from room_4 via purple_door_1.
4. `gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1` - Go to blue_door_1 that connects room_2 and room_1.
5. `toggle blue_door_1` - Unlock blue_door_1.
6. `gotoroom room_2 room_1 blue_door_1` - Go to room_1 from room_2 via blue_door_1.
7. `gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1` - Go to blue_box_1 in room_1.
8. `pick blue_box_1 room_1` - Pick up blue_box_1.

Wait, I need to review an additional constraint that I might have missed:

"If expression 'you are holding some object' holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: 'At least one of the following conditions is true: "purple_box_1 is in room_4", "you are in room_1"'"

So before holding any object, we must either have purple_box_1 in room_4 or be in room_1. In the plan above, we'd be in room_1 before picking up blue_box_1, so this constraint is satisfied.

Hmm. However, there's a constraint that we need to satisfy:

"The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'At least one of the following conditions is true: "you are in front of red_box_1", "you are in room_2"'"

Given our path, we'd naturally be in room_2 as we pass through it, so this constraint is satisfied as well.

Let's double-check for any other constraints or considerations I might have missed:

The constraint "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'you are holding some object'" is satisfied by our goal of holding blue_box_1.

I think our plan is correct and optimal. Let's restate it for clarity:

1. `gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_2`
2. `toggle purple_door_1`
3. `gotoroom room_4 room_2 purple_door_1`
4. `gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1`
5. `toggle blue_door_1`
6. `gotoroom room_2 room_1 blue_door_1`
7. `gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1`
8. `pick blue_box_1 room_1`

Actually, let me revisit and make sure the syntax for the actions is correct:

For the `gotodoor` action, the order should be `gotodoor d r1 r2` where we're going to door d from room r1 connecting to room r2.

For the `gotoroom` action, the order should be `gotoroom r1 r2 d` where we're going from room r1 to room r2 via door d.

So, our revised plan:

1. `gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_2` - Go in front of purple_door_1 in room_4, which connects to room_2.
2. `toggle purple_door_1` - Unlock purple_door_1.
3. `gotoroom room_4 room_2 purple_door_1` - Go to room_2 from room_4 via purple_door_1.
4. `gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1` - Go in front of blue_door_1 in room_2, which connects to room_1.
5. `toggle blue_door_1` - Unlock blue_door_1.
6. `gotoroom room_2 room_1 blue_door_1` - Go to room_1 from room_2 via blue_door_1.
7. `gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1` - Go in front of blue_box_1 in room_1.
8. `pick blue_box_1 room_1` - Pick up blue_box_1.

This looks correct now, and I believe it's the optimal plan given the constraints.
