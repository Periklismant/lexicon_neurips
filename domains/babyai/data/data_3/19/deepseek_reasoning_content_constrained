Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. Hmm, the goal is to have a blue box that I'm holding. So I need to pick up a blue box. The available blue boxes are blue_box_1 in room_1 and blue_box_2 in room_3. But I'm starting in room_4. 

First, check the doors. All doors are locked initially. The constraints say that red_door_1 must always be locked. So I can't unlock red_door_1. That connects room_3 and room_4. Since it's locked, moving between room_3 and room_4 via red_door_1 isn't possible. So maybe I need to use other doors. Let's see the connections:

- room_1 and room_2 connected via blue_door_1 (blue, locked)
- room_1 and room_3 via green_door_1 (green, locked)
- room_2 and room_4 via purple_door_1 (purple, locked)
- room_3 and room_4 via red_door_1 (red, locked and must stay locked)

So all doors are locked. To move between rooms, I need to unlock doors. But to unlock a door, I need to toggle it, which requires being in front of it. But doors are blocked if there's an object in front. Wait, the "goto door" action has a precondition that there's no object blocking the position in front of the door in the current room. So if there's an object in front of the door, I can't go there to toggle it.

Looking at initial positions: The objects in each room:

room_1: blue_box_1
room_2: purple_box_1, purple_ball_1, purple_ball_2
room_3: blue_box_2, purple_box_2
room_4: red_box_1, yellow_box_1

So in room_4, there's red_box_1 and yellow_box_1. The doors leading from room_4 are purple_door_1 (to room_2) and red_door_1 (to room_3, but red_door must stay locked). So to leave room_4, the only possible door is purple_door_1 leading to room_2. But purple_door_1 is locked. So I need to unlock it. But to unlock it, I need to be in front of it. However, is there an object blocking the position in front of purple_door_1 in room_4? The initial state doesn't mention any objects blocking doors. Wait, the problem states that objects can block doors if they are in front of them. The initial positions don't specify objects blocking doors, so maybe the doors are not blocked. Let me check the original state: no mention of objects blocking doors, so all doors are unblocked initially. Therefore, I can go to purple_door_1 in room_4, toggle it to unlock, then go through to room_2.

Wait, but room_4's purple_door_1 connects to room_2. So in room_4, the purple_door_1 is present. So to go to room_2 from room_4, I need to be in front of purple_door_1 in room_4, then use gotoroom room_4 room_2 purple_door_1. But first, I need to unlock purple_door_1. So steps:

1. In room_4, go to purple_door_1 (gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_2)
2. Toggle purple_door_1 to unlock it.
3. Use gotoroom to move to room_2.

Once in room_2, maybe there's a way to get to room_1 or room_3. But the blue boxes are in room_1 (blue_box_1) and room_3 (blue_box_2). Let's see. To get to room_1, from room_2, the blue_door_1 connects room_1 and room_2. But blue_door_1 is locked. So I need to unlock it. To unlock blue_door_1, I need to go to it in either room_1 or room_2. But if I'm in room_2, I can go to blue_door_1, toggle it. However, do I need to pick up a key? Wait, the problem doesn't mention keys. The toggle action just toggles the door's state. So if I can reach the door, I can unlock it. So let's think.

From room_2, after arriving there from room_4, I can:

4. Go to blue_door_1 (gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1)
5. Toggle it to unlock.
6. Gotoroom to room_1 via blue_door_1.

Then in room_1, blue_box_1 is there. So:

7. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1
8. pick blue_box_1 room_1

But wait, to pick up the box, I need to be in the same room and not holding anything. Since we just arrived in room_1, that's possible. But before that, we need to make sure the doors are unlocked.

But let's check the constraints:

Constraints:

1. red_door_1 must always be locked. So never toggle it.

2. At least one state must have "you are in front of red_box_1" or "you are in room_2". Well, during the plan, when we go from room_4 to room_2 via purple_door_1, we are in room_2, so that satisfies that constraint. So that's covered.

3. At least one state where you are holding some object. The goal is to hold a blue box, so that will be satisfied when we pick up blue_box_1 or blue_box_2.

4. If you are holding an object in some state, there must be an earlier state where either purple_box_1 is in room_4 or you are in room_1. Since purple_box_1 starts in room_2 and we need to pick up a blue box (either in room_1 or room_3), let's see. If we pick blue_box_1 in room_1, then the earlier state where we are in room_1 is required. So that's covered because to pick blue_box_1, we have to be in room_1, which would have been achieved before. So that constraint is satisfied.

Alternatively, if we go for blue_box_2 in room_3, but getting to room_3 from room_4 requires red_door_1, which must stay locked. So that's impossible. So the only option is blue_box_1 in room_1.

So the plan would be:

Start in room_4.

1. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_2
2. toggle purple_door_1 (unlocks it)
3. gotoroom room_4 room_2 purple_door_1 (now in room_2)
4. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1
5. toggle blue_door_1 (unlocks it)
6. gotoroom room_2 room_1 blue_door_1 (now in room_1)
7. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1
8. pick blue_box_1 room_1

But wait, after step 3, we are in room_2. So we have to check the constraint that in at least one state, we are in room_2. That's covered by step 3. Also, when we pick up the box (step 8), we need to check the fourth constraint: if holding an object, then there must be an earlier state where purple_box_1 is in room_4 or in room_1. Wait, purple_box_1 is initially in room_2. So the earlier state where we are in room_1 (step 6 onward) would satisfy the "you are in room_1" part. So when we pick up the box in room_1, the earlier state (steps 6-7) being in room_1 satisfies that. So that's okay.

But also, when moving from room_4 to room_2, we are in room_2, which satisfies the second constraint. So that's covered.

Another constraint is that red_door_1 remains locked. Since we never touch it, that's okay.

Now, let's check if all actions are possible.

Starting in room_4.

1. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_2: Preconditions are that we are in a room connected by purple_door_1 (room_4 is connected to room_2 via purple_door_1), and no object is blocking in front of the door. Since room_4 has red_box_1 and yellow_box_1, but not blocking the door (assuming initial state has doors unblocked), this is possible.

2. toggle purple_door_1: since we are in front of it, this works. Now purple_door_1 is unlocked.

3. gotoroom room_4 room_2 purple_door_1: door is unlocked, so possible. Now in room_2.

4. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1: blue_door_1 connects room_2 and room_1, so possible. No objects blocking in room_2? The room has purple_box_1, purple_ball_1, purple_ball_2. If they are not in front of the door, then possible. Assuming they are not blocking.

5. toggle blue_door_1: unlocks it.

6. gotoroom room_2 room_1 blue_door_1: now in room_1.

7. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1: possible.

8. pick blue_box_1 room_1: since not holding anything and in the same room, possible.

This plan should work. Let's check the constraints:

- red_door_1 remains locked: yes, never toggled.

- At least one state in room_2: step 3-5 are in room_2.

- At least one state holding an object: step 8.

- When holding (step 8), earlier state must be in room_1 or purple_box_1 in room_4. Since in step 6 we are in room_1, which is earlier than 8, that's satisfied.

So the plan should be valid and optimal. Let's count the steps: 8 actions. Is there a shorter plan?

Alternative path: Maybe getting to room_3 via another door? But red_door_1 is locked and must stay so. So room_3 is only accessible via room_1's green_door_1. To get to room_3 from room_1, need to unlock green_door_1. But room_1's green_door_1 connects to room_3, which is locked. So if we go that way, that's more steps. Since blue_box_2 is in room_3, but getting there would require unlocking green_door_1 and then red_door_1 is locked, so can't return. But the goal is to have a blue box. So blue_box_1 in room_1 is the easier target.

Thus, the plan is optimal.
