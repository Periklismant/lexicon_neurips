Let me first understand the problem. 

I'm an agent navigating a gridworld with 4 rooms. The rooms are arranged in a square formation:
- room_1: north-west
- room_2: south-west
- room_3: north-east
- room_4: south-east

There are 4 doors connecting the following room pairs:
- room_1-room_2 (purple_door_1)
- room_1-room_3 (red_door_1)
- room_2-room_4 (purple_door_2)
- room_3-room_4 (yellow_door_1)

The rooms may contain boxes and balls.

I need to provide a sequence of actions to solve the planning problem.

The actions are:
- "gotoobject x r": Go in front of to object x in room r.
- "gotoempty": Go in front of an empty position of the room, which does not contain any object.
- "gotodoor d r1 r2": Go in front of door d, connecting room r1 to room r2.
- "gotoroom r1 r2 d": Go to room r2 from room r1 using door d.
- "pick x r": Pick up object x in room r.
- "drop x r": Drop object x in room r.
- "toggle d": Unlock door d if is locked. Lock door d if is unlocked.

Let's understand the initial state:
- I am in room_1.
- blue_ball_1 is in room_1.
- purple_box_1 is in room_2.
- green_ball_1, green_ball_2, grey_ball_1, blue_ball_2 are in room_3.
- red_ball_1, yellow_ball_1 are in room_4.
- All doors are locked.
- The doors are: purple_door_1 (connecting room_1 and room_2), red_door_1 (connecting room_1 and room_3), purple_door_2 (connecting room_2 and room_4), and yellow_door_1 (connecting room_3 and room_4).
- I am not holding any object.
- I have visited room_1.

The goal is to:
- Be in room_4.
- Be in front of red_ball_1, which is in room_4.

And I have the following constraints:
1. "red_door_1 is not locked" must be true in at least one state.
2. "you are not in room_2" must be true in every state.
3. "you are in front of purple_door_2" must be true in at least one state.
4. If "you are in front of purple_door_2" is true in some state s, then "you are in room_3" OR "you are holding some object" must be true at state s or some later state.

Now, let's think about a plan:

Given the constraints, I can't go to room_2. This means I have to find another path to room_4, which would be through room_3.

First, I need to unlock red_door_1 to go to room_3 (and to satisfy constraint 1). Then, I need to unlock yellow_door_1 to go from room_3 to room_4. Once in room_4, I need to go in front of red_ball_1 to satisfy the goal.

To satisfy constraint 3, I need to be in front of purple_door_2 at some point. Given that I can't go to room_2 (constraint 2), I need to be in front of purple_door_2 from room_4. And since I need to either be in room_3 or holding some object after that (constraint 4), I could go from room_4 to room_3 via yellow_door_1 or pick up an object in room_4.

But let's start with the simpler part of the plan:

1. Go in front of red_door_1 (from room_1).
2. Toggle red_door_1 (unlock it).
3. Go to room_3 from room_1 via red_door_1.
4. Go in front of yellow_door_1 (from room_3).
5. Toggle yellow_door_1 (unlock it).
6. Go to room_4 from room_3 via yellow_door_1.

Now, I'm in room_4. I can go in front of purple_door_2 and then either pick up an object in room_4 or go back to room_3 to satisfy constraint 4.

7. Go in front of purple_door_2 (from room_4).
8. Pick up red_ball_1 in room_4. (This satisfies constraint 4 and allows me to move the ball if needed.)
9. Drop red_ball_1 in room_4. (This ensures the ball is in room_4 as per the goal.)
10. Go in front of red_ball_1 (in room_4).

Now, I've achieved my goal of being in room_4 and in front of red_ball_1, which is also in room_4.

Let's double check against the constraints:
- Constraint 1: I unlocked red_door_1 in step 2.
- Constraint 2: I never went to room_2.
- Constraint 3: I was in front of purple_door_2 in step 7.
- Constraint 4: After being in front of purple_door_2 in step 7, I picked up red_ball_1 in step 8, which means I was holding an object. Thus, "you are holding some object" is satisfied.

Actually, let me re-evaluate this plan...

In steps 8 and 9, I picked up and dropped red_ball_1. However, the goal specifies: "There is a ball v such that "The following conditions are all true: "v is red", "v is in room_4", "you are in room_4", "you are in front of v"". 

Since there's already a red ball (red_ball_1) in room_4, I don't need to move it. I just need to go in front of it. So, I should modify the plan:

1. Go in front of red_door_1 (from room_1).
2. Toggle red_door_1 (unlock it).
3. Go to room_3 from room_1 via red_door_1.
4. Go in front of yellow_door_1 (from room_3).
5. Toggle yellow_door_1 (unlock it).
6. Go to room_4 from room_3 via yellow_door_1.
7. Go in front of purple_door_2 (from room_4).
8. Go in front of red_ball_1 (in room_4).

But I then realized that we still miss the constraint 4. After being in front of purple_door_2 in step 7, I need to either be in room_3 or holding an object. But I'm going to be in front of red_ball_1 in room_4 in step 8, which doesn't satisfy the constraint.

I need to revise my plan again:

1. Go in front of red_door_1 (from room_1).
2. Toggle red_door_1 (unlock it).
3. Go to room_3 from room_1 via red_door_1.
4. Go in front of yellow_door_1 (from room_3).
5. Toggle yellow_door_1 (unlock it).
6. Go to room_4 from room_3 via yellow_door_1.
7. Go in front of red_ball_1 (in room_4).
8. Pick up red_ball_1 in room_4.
9. Go in front of purple_door_2 (from room_4).
10. Drop red_ball_1 in room_4.
11. Go in front of red_ball_1 (in room_4).

Now, let's verify the constraints:
- Constraint 1: I unlocked red_door_1 in step 2.
- Constraint 2: I never went to room_2.
- Constraint 3: I was in front of purple_door_2 in step 9.
- Constraint 4: After being in front of purple_door_2 in step 9, I was holding red_ball_1. Thus, "you are holding some object" is satisfied.

And my goal state is also achieved: I am in room_4 and in front of red_ball_1, which is also in room_4.

However, I realize that in this plan, I first go in front of red_ball_1 (step 7), pick it up (step 8), and then go in front of purple_door_2 (step 9). But, once I pick up red_ball_1, I am no longer in front of it. So I'm not sure if this sequence works. Let me reconsider the actions:

The action "pick x r" has the effect: "you are no longer in front of x". So, after picking up red_ball_1, I will not be in front of it anymore. Similarly, after "goto object" or "goto door", I will no longer be in front of the previous object or door.

Let me revise the plan once more:

1. Go in front of red_door_1 (from room_1).
2. Toggle red_door_1 (unlock it).
3. Go to room_3 from room_1 via red_door_1.
4. Go in front of yellow_door_1 (from room_3).
5. Toggle yellow_door_1 (unlock it).
6. Go to room_4 from room_3 via yellow_door_1.
7. Go in front of purple_door_2 (from room_4).
8. Go in front of red_ball_1 (in room_4).
9. Pick up red_ball_1 in room_4. (This satisfies constraint 4 since I'm holding an object after being in front of purple_door_2).
10. Drop red_ball_1 in room_4.
11. Go to room_3 from room_4 via yellow_door_1. (This also satisfies constraint 4 since I'm in room_3 after being in front of purple_door_2).
12. Go to room_4 from room_3 via yellow_door_1.
13. Go in front of red_ball_1 (in room_4).

But I realized that this plan is unnecessarily complex. Since red_ball_1 is already in room_4, I don't need to pick it up and drop it. I can simply go in front of it. And after being in front of purple_door_2, I can either go to room_3 or hold an object. Let's simplify:

1. Go in front of red_door_1 (from room_1).
2. Toggle red_door_1 (unlock it).
3. Go to room_3 from room_1 via red_door_1.
4. Go in front of yellow_door_1 (from room_3).
5. Toggle yellow_door_1 (unlock it).
6. Go to room_4 from room_3 via yellow_door_1.
7. Go in front of purple_door_2 (from room_4).
8. Go to room_3 from room_4 via yellow_door_1. (This satisfies constraint 4 since I'm in room_3 after being in front of purple_door_2).
9. Go to room_4 from room_3 via yellow_door_1.
10. Go in front of red_ball_1 (in room_4).

But I still need to think about it a bit more. I feel like I'm missing something.

Actually, I think I'm making things too complicated. I want to make sure constraint 4 is satisfied. Let me revisit the constraint: "If you are in front of purple_door_2 in some state s, then you are in room_3 OR you are holding some object must hold at s or at some state after s."

So after I am in front of purple_door_2, I need to ensure that in the current state or any later state, I am in room_3 or holding some object. If I go to room_3 after being in front of purple_door_2, the constraint is satisfied for the rest of the plan.

Let's simplify:

1. Go in front of red_door_1 (from room_1).
2. Toggle red_door_1 (unlock it).
3. Go to room_3 from room_1 via red_door_1.
4. Go in front of yellow_door_1 (from room_3).
5. Toggle yellow_door_1 (unlock it).
6. Go to room_4 from room_3 via yellow_door_1.
7. Go in front of purple_door_2 (from room_4).
8. Go to room_3 from room_4 via yellow_door_1. (This satisfies constraint 4).
9. Go to room_4 from room_3 via yellow_door_1.
10. Go in front of red_ball_1 (in room_4).

This plan achieves all goals and constraints:
- I end up in room_4, in front of red_ball_1, which is also in room_4.
- red_door_1 is not locked in later states (after step 2).
- I never go to room_2.
- I am in front of purple_door_2 at step 7.
- After being in front of purple_door_2, I go to room_3, satisfying constraint 4.

But wait, I realized that after the "gotoroom" action, "you are no longer in front of any object or door". This means after step 8, I will no longer be in front of purple_door_2. So, being in room_3 doesn't guarantee that constraint 4 is satisfied.

I think I got confused about the constraint. Let me break it down:

"If expression 'you are in front of purple_door_2' holds in some state s, then expression 'At least one of the following conditions is true: you are in room_3, you are holding some object' must hold at s or at some state after s."

This constraint means that after I'm in front of purple_door_2, I must ensure that I'm either in room_3 or holding an object. It doesn't mean that I need to be simultaneously in front of purple_door_2 and in room_3 or holding an object.

So my plan still holds. After being in front of purple_door_2 (step 7), I go to room_3 (step 8), which satisfies the constraint.

Actually, re-reading constraint 4 more carefully, let's see what it means: 

"If you are in front of purple_door_2 in some state s, then 'at least one of (you are in room_3 OR you are holding some object)' must hold at s or at some state after s."

This means that after I'm in front of purple_door_2, I must ensure that I'm either in room_3 or holding an object (or both). 

Looking at my current plan:
7. Go in front of purple_door_2 (from room_4).
8. Go to room_3 from room_4 via yellow_door_1.

After step 7, I'm in front of purple_door_2. After step 8, I'm in room_3. This satisfies the constraint.

This seems correct. Once I'm in front of purple_door_2 and the next step I go to room_3, the constraint is satisfied because I'm in room_3 after being in front of purple_door_2.

To be clear, can you be in front of a door from either adjacent room? Since purple_door_2 connects rooms 2 and 4, and I'm only allowed to be in rooms 1, 3, and 4, I need to make sure I can be in front of purple_door_2 from room 4.

Looking at the actions, I see:
"gotodoor d r1 r2": Go in front of door d, connecting room r1 to room r2.

The condition is: "goto door": you may only go in front of a door d if (i) you are in a room which door d is connecting with another room, and (ii) there is no object blocking the position in front of d in the room you are currently in.

So it seems I can be in front of a door from any adjacent room.

Alright, now I'm confident in my plan:

1. gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3
2. toggle red_door_1
3. gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1
4. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_4
5. toggle yellow_door_1
6. gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_1
7. gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_2
8. gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_1
9. gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_1
10. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_4

This achieves all goals and constraints:
- I end up in room_4, in front of red_ball_1, which is also in room_4.
- red_door_1 is not locked after step 2, satisfying constraint 1.
- I never go to room_2, satisfying constraint 2.
- I am in front of purple_door_2 at step 7, satisfying constraint 3.
- After being in front of purple_door_2 at step 7, I go to room_3 at step 8, which means I am in room_3 after being in front of purple_door_2, satisfying constraint 4.

Alright, I believe this is a valid plan that achieves all goals and satisfies all constraints.

Actually, let's re-read the constraint again:

"If expression 'you are in front of purple_door_2' holds in some state s, then expression 'At least one of the following conditions is true: "you are in room_3", "you are holding some object"' must hold at s or at some state after s."

This means that after I'm in front of purple_door_2, I must ensure that I'm either in room_3 or holding an object (or both).

In my plan, after being in front of purple_door_2 at step 7, I go to room_3 at step 8. This means the constraint is satisfied.

I think my plan is correct. Let's finalize:

```
gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3
toggle red_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_4
toggle yellow_door_1
gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_1
gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_2
gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_1
gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_1
gotoobject red_ball_1 room_4
```

I need to double-check this plan to make sure it's correct.

Actually, I want to see if this plan could be optimized. Specifically, the steps where I go from room_4 to room_3 and then back to room_4, I want to see if there's a more direct way to fulfill constraint 4.

The constraint says: After being in front of purple_door_2, I need to be in room_3 or holding an object (either immediately or in a future state).

Maybe instead of going back to room_3, I could pick up an object in room_4 to satisfy the constraint. Since there are 2 balls in room_4 (red_ball_1 and yellow_ball_1), I can pick up one of them. But then I'd have to drop it if I want to be in front of red_ball_1 (since being in front of something while holding something else isn't mentioned as a valid state).

Actually, let me think about the exact sequence of actions more carefully:

1. gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3
2. toggle red_door_1
3. gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1
4. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_4
5. toggle yellow_door_1
6. gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_1
7. gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_2
8. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_4
9. pick red_ball_1 room_4
10. drop red_ball_1 room_4
11. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_4

After step 7, I'm in front of purple_door_2. Per constraint 4, I need to be in room_3 or holding an object. Since step 9, I'm holding red_ball_1, which satisfies the constraint.

This alternative plan also achieves all goals and constraints:
- I end up in room_4, in front of red_ball_1, which is also in room_4.
- red_door_1 is not locked after step 2, satisfying constraint 1.
- I never go to room_2, satisfying constraint 2.
- I am in front of purple_door_2 at step 7, satisfying constraint 3.
- After being in front of purple_door_2 at step 7, I pick up red_ball_1 at step 9, which means I'm holding an object after being in front of purple_door_2, satisfying constraint 4.

This seems more efficient than my original plan because it avoids unnecessary room transitions.

However, after more thought, I realize that after I pick up red_ball_1, I'm not in front of red_ball_1 anymore. So I'd have to drop it and then go in front of it again to satisfy the goal. So the steps should be:

1. gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3
2. toggle red_door_1
3. gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1
4. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_4
5. toggle yellow_door_1
6. gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_1
7. gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_2
8. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_4
9. pick red_ball_1 room_4 (Now I'm holding red_ball_1, which satisfies constraint 4)
10. gotoempty (I need to go in front of an empty position to drop the ball)
11. drop red_ball_1 room_4
12. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_4

This plan seems valid and efficient. It achieves the goal and satisfies all constraints.

Actually, I realized there may be a more elegant solution. Let's consider the following:

1. gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3
2. toggle red_door_1
3. gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1
4. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_4
5. toggle yellow_door_1
6. gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_1
7. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_4 (Go directly to red_ball_1, which is already in room_4)
8. pick red_ball_1 room_4 (Pick up the ball)
9. gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_2 (Go in front of purple_door_2)
10. gotoempty (Go in front of an empty position)
11. drop red_ball_1 room_4 (Drop the ball)
12. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_4 (Go in front of the ball again)

In this plan, after being in front of purple_door_2 (step 9), I'm holding red_ball_1, which satisfies constraint 4. This seems like a valid plan.

Actually, I'm going back and forth a bit, but I want to be absolutely sure. Let me reconsider the whole problem:

The goal: Be in room_4 and in front of red_ball_1, which is also in room_4.

1. I am in room_1, so I need to get to room_4.
2. I can go from room_1 to room_3 (via red_door_1) and then from room_3 to room_4 (via yellow_door_1). Or, I can go from room_1 to room_2 (via purple_door_1) and then from room_2 to room_4 (via purple_door_2).
3. However, constraint 2 says I must never be in room_2, so I must use the route through room_3.
4. red_door_1 must be unlocked in at least one state (constraint 1).
5. I must be in front of purple_door_2 at some point (constraint 3).
6. After being in front of purple_door_2, I must ensure I'm in room_3 or holding an object (constraint 4).

Given all of this, my plan should be:

1. gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3
2. toggle red_door_1 (This satisfies constraint 1)
3. gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1
4. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_4
5. toggle yellow_door_1
6. gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_1
7. gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_2 (This satisfies constraint 3)
8. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_4
9. pick red_ball_1 room_4 (This satisfies constraint 4 because I'm holding an object)
10. gotoempty
11. drop red_ball_1 room_4
12. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_4 (This achieves the goal)

This plan seems valid and achieves all goals and constraints. However, you know, I wonder if there's a more efficient way of satisfying constraint 4. 

Specifically, I'm now thinking:

7. gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_2 (This satisfies constraint 3)
8. gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_1 (This satisfies constraint 4 because I'm in room_3)
9. gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_1
10. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_4 (This achieves the goal)

Both paths satisfy all constraints. The former is 12 steps, the latter is 10 steps. Thus, the latter is more efficient.

But wait, let me carefully double check this. There's a possible issue in the latter approach: after step 7, I'm in front of purple_door_2. After step 8, I've used the gotoroom action, which means I'm no longer in front of any object or door. But, constraint 4 says that after being in front of purple_door_2, I need to be in room_3 or holding an object.

I want to make sure that step 8 (gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_1) does indeed satisfy constraint 4. The constraint says: "If you are in front of purple_door_2 in some state s, then 'you are in room_3 OR you are holding some object' must hold at s or at some later state."

After step 7, I'm in front of purple_door_2 in room_4. After step 8, I'm no longer in front of purple_door_2, but I am in room_3. So, the constraint is satisfied.

I believe the 10-step plan is more efficient and valid.

I do actually have one remaining worry, whether the "gotodoor d r1 r2" action actually allows me to access a door from both of the adjacent rooms or just from r1.

Looking at the preconditions:
"goto door": you may only go in front of a door d if (i) you are in a room which door d is connecting with another room, and (ii) there is no object blocking the position in front of d in the room you are currently in.

I'm in room_4, and purple_door_2 connects room_4 with room_2. So, I should be able to go in front of purple_door_2 from room_4. 

So I'm quite confident that this plan is valid:

1. gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3
2. toggle red_door_1
3. gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1
4. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_4
5. toggle yellow_door_1
6. gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_1
7. gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_2
8. gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_1
9. gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_1
10. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_4

Let me triple-check the satisfaction of the constraints:
- Constraint 1: "red_door_1 is not locked" must be true in at least one state. This is satisfied after step 2.
- Constraint 2: "you are not in room_2" must be true in every state. This is satisfied since I never go to room_2.
- Constraint 3: "you are in front of purple_door_2" must be true in at least one state. This is satisfied at step 7.
- Constraint 4: After being in front of purple_door_2, I need to be in room_3 or holding an object. This is satisfied at step 8 because I'm in room_3.

Does the plan achieve the goal?
- I need to be in room_4 and in front of red_ball_1, which is also in room_4. At the end of the plan, I am in room_4 and in front of red_ball_1, which satisfies the goal.

I believe this 10-step plan is valid, achieves the goal, and satisfies all constraints.

Actually, I'm wondering if I could optimize this even further.

Looking at the plan:
7. gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_2
8. gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_1
9. gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_1
10. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_4

Steps 8 and 9 seem a bit roundabout. I go from room_4 to room_3 and then back to room_4. Could I avoid this and still satisfy constraint 4?

Constraint 4 says: After being in front of purple_door_2, I need to be in room_3 or holding an object.

So, another way to satisfy this would be to pick up an object. There's already red_ball_1 in room_4, which I'm ultimately trying to go in front of. I could pick up red_ball_1, which would satisfy constraint 4. Then, I'd drop it and go in front of it.

7. gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_2
8. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_4
9. pick red_ball_1 room_4 (This satisfies constraint 4 because I'm holding red_ball_1)
10. gotoempty
11. drop red_ball_1 room_4
12. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_4

However, this alternative is 12 steps, whereas the plan with the room transitions is 10 steps. So, I stick with the 10-step plan.

Yeah, I've considered things carefully and believe the 10-step plan is the most efficient valid plan. Let me restate it for clarity:

```
gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3
toggle red_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_4
toggle yellow_door_1
gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_1
gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_2
gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_1
gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_1
gotoobject red_ball_1 room_4
```

Upon careful consideration, I'm confident that this plan is valid, achieves the goal, and satisfies all constraints in the most efficient manner.

Here's the final plan:

```
gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3
toggle red_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_4
toggle yellow_door_1
gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_1
gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_2
