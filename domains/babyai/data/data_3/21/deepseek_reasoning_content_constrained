Okay, let's tackle this planning problem step by step. First, I need to understand the initial state, the goal, and the constraints. 

The initial state has the agent in room_1. The goal is to have a red ball in room_4, with the agent in room_4 and in front of that red ball. The constraints include unlocking red_door_1 at some point, never being in room_2, being in front of purple_door_2 at least once, and whenever that happens, the agent must be in room_3 or holding an object either then or later.

Starting in room_1, the agent needs to get to room_4. The available doors from room_1 are purple_door_1 (to room_2) and red_door_1 (to room_3). But the constraint says we can never be in room_2, so we must avoid using purple_door_1. So the only way is through red_door_1 to room_3, then from room_3 to room_4 via yellow_door_1. However, red_door_1 is initially locked. So the agent needs to unlock it. To do that, the agent must be in front of red_door_1 and toggle it. 

But to get in front of red_door_1, the agent is in room_1. The preconditions for gotodoor require that there's no object blocking the position in front of the door. Looking at the initial state, room_1 has blue_ball_1. If the blue_ball_1 is blocking the door, then the agent can't go to the door. Wait, the problem says "there is no object blocking the position in front of d in the room you are currently in." So if the blue_ball_1 is in front of red_door_1 in room_1, then the agent can't go to the door until it's moved. But according to the initial state, blue_ball_1 is in room_1. The door's position might be blocked by the ball. So the agent needs to pick up blue_ball_1 first.

So first, the agent can go to blue_ball_1 in room_1, pick it up, then drop it somewhere else not blocking the door. Wait, but dropping requires being in front of an empty position. Alternatively, after picking up the ball, the agent can go to the door. Let's see:

1. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_1
2. pick blue_ball_1 room_1
Now the agent is holding blue_ball_1. Then, since the door was blocked by the ball, now that it's picked up, the position is clear. Then the agent can gotoempty to move away from the previous spot, then go to the door.

But wait, after picking up the ball, the agent is no longer in front of it. The effect of "pick" is that you're no longer in front of x. So after picking, the agent is not in front of anything. Then, the agent can go to the door. Let's try:

3. gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3
4. toggle red_door_1 (since the agent is in front of it, and it's locked)
This unlocks red_door_1. Then, the agent can go to room_3 via gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1.

Once in room_3, the agent can then go to yellow_door_1. But yellow_door_1 is locked. So need to toggle it. But first, check if there are any objects blocking the door in room_3. Room_3 has green_ball_1, green_ball_2, grey_ball_1, blue_ball_2. If any of these are in front of the door, the agent can't go to the door. So perhaps need to pick up those balls. However, the goal is to have a red ball in room_4. The red_ball_1 is already in room_4. So the agent doesn't need to move any balls except perhaps to unblock doors.

But let's see. The agent needs to get to room_4. From room_3, the door to room_4 is yellow_door_1. So:

After entering room_3, the agent needs to go to yellow_door_1. But if there's a ball blocking it, the agent must pick it up. Let's check the initial state: in room_3, the balls are green_ball_1, green_ball_2, grey_ball_1, blue_ball_2. We don't know their positions, but the problem statement might assume that unless stated otherwise, objects are not blocking doors. But according to the problem's initial state, there's no mention of any object blocking a door, so maybe all doors are unblocked except possibly those in the initial room. Wait, but in room_1, blue_ball_1 was in the room. If the agent can go to the door only if there's no object blocking it. So perhaps the initial position of the agent is not in front of any object, but the blue_ball_1 is in room_1 but not blocking the door. Hmm, but the problem doesn't specify the positions of objects relative to doors. This is a bit ambiguous, but perhaps we can assume that objects are not blocking doors unless stated. So maybe the agent can go to the doors directly.

But in room_1, to get to red_door_1, the agent can use gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3, provided that there's no object blocking it. Since blue_ball_1 is in room_1, but if it's not blocking the door, then the agent can go there. However, the problem's initial state doesn't mention any objects blocking doors, so maybe they are not blocked. So perhaps the agent can go directly to the door without moving the ball. Wait, but the agent is in room_1. The blue_ball_1 is in room_1, but if the agent is in front of the blue_ball_1, then after picking it up, the door is unblocked. Wait, maybe the initial position of the agent is not in front of any object, so they can go to the door. Let's assume that the doors are not blocked. So maybe the steps are:

1. gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3
But red_door_1 is locked. To unlock it, the agent needs to be in front of it and toggle. However, to get in front of it, the agent must perform gotodoor, which is allowed if there's no object blocking. So:

1. gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3
2. toggle red_door_1 (unlocks it)
3. gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1 (now in room_3)
Then in room_3, need to get to yellow_door_1. But yellow_door_1 is locked. So:

4. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_4
5. toggle yellow_door_1 (unlocks it)
6. gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_1 (now in room_4)
Then, in room_4, the agent needs to be in front of red_ball_1, which is already there. So:

7. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_4
Now, check the goal: agent is in room_4, in front of red_ball_1, which is red and in room_4. That meets the goal.

But wait, the constraints: 

- The first constraint is that red_door_1 must be unlocked at least once. Since we toggled it in step 2, which unlocked it, that's satisfied.

- Second constraint: never be in room_2. Our path is room_1 -> room_3 -> room_4. So that's okay.

- Third constraint: must be in front of purple_door_2 at least once. Purple_door_2 connects room_2 and room_4. But the agent is never in room_2. However, the agent can go to room_4 and then go to purple_door_2 from room_4. Wait, purple_door_2 connects room_2 and room_4. So in room_4, the agent can go to purple_door_2. But the agent is in room_4. The gotodoor action for purple_door_2 would require that the agent is in a room connected by that door. Since the agent is in room_4, which is connected to room_2 via purple_door_2. So:

After arriving in room_4 (step 6), the agent can go to purple_door_2:

7. gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_2

But room_2 is forbidden. However, the agent is in room_4. The action gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_2 is allowed if the agent is in a room connected by the door (room_4 is connected to room_2 via purple_door_2). However, the problem states that "you may only go in front of a door d if (i) you are in a room which door d is connecting with another room, and (ii) there is no object blocking the position in front of d in the room you are currently in."

So the agent is in room_4, which is connected via purple_door_2 to room_2. Assuming there's no object blocking the door in room_4, the agent can perform gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_2. Then, that would satisfy the third constraint. However, after that, the agent needs to satisfy the fourth constraint: whenever they are in front of purple_door_2, they must be in room_3 or holding an object at that state or later. But in this case, the agent is in room_4 when they are in front of purple_door_2. So to satisfy the constraint, the agent must be holding an object either at that time or later. 

But in the current plan, after step 6 (in room_4), the agent is not holding any object. So if they go to purple_door_2 (step 7), then the fourth constraint requires that either they are in room_3 (which they are not) or holding an object either then or after. So after step 7, they need to pick up an object. But in room_4, the objects are red_ball_1 and yellow_ball_1. So after step 7, the agent can:

8. gotoroom room_4 room_4 (no, wait, they are already in room_4). Wait, after being in front of purple_door_2 (step7), the agent can go to red_ball_1:

But to pick up red_ball_1, they need to be in front of it. So:

8. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_4

9. pick red_ball_1 room_4

Now, after step9, the agent is holding red_ball_1. So the constraint would be satisfied because in step7 (front of purple_door_2), the agent was in room_4, but later (step9) they are holding an object. Thus, the fourth constraint is met.

But then, the goal requires that the agent is in front of v (the red_ball_1) in room_4. So after dropping it? No, the goal says "you are in front of v" and "v is in room_4". So if the agent picks up the red_ball_1, then it's no longer in room_4. Therefore, that's a problem. Because the goal requires that v is in room_4, so the agent cannot pick it up and drop it again. Wait, the red_ball_1 is already in room_4. The goal is to have a red ball in room_4 (which it already is), and the agent in room_4 in front of it. So if the agent is in front of red_ball_1 in room_4, that's the goal. So steps 7 (goto purple_door_2), then 8 (goto red_ball_1), which would make the agent in front of red_ball_1. But step7 is in front of purple_door_2, step8 moves to red_ball_1.

Wait, the plan so far:

1. goto red_door_1 in room_1

2. toggle to unlock

3. goto room_3 via red_door_1

4. goto yellow_door_1 in room_3

5. toggle to unlock

6. goto room_4 via yellow_door_1

7. goto purple_door_2 in room_4 (meets constraint 3)

8. goto red_ball_1 in room_4 (now in front of it)

But step8 is gotoobject red_ball_1 room_4. Then, the agent is in front of red_ball_1 in room_4. So that would satisfy the goal. But after step7, the agent is in front of purple_door_2. The constraint says that if that's the case, then at that state or after, they must be in room_3 or holding an object. At step7, they are in room_4, not room_3, and not holding anything. Then in step8, they go to red_ball_1, then in step9, pick it up. But the constraint requires that either at step7 or after, they must hold an object. So even if they pick it up in step9, that's after step7, so it's okay. But the problem is, after step8, the agent is in front of red_ball_1. So if they just stay there, then the goal is achieved. But in the current plan, after step7, they need to go to step8 (goto red_ball_1), which would make them in front of it. So the final state would be:

- agent in room_4

- in front of red_ball_1, which is in room_4.

Thus, the goal is achieved. But the fourth constraint: when they were in front of purple_door_2 (step7), they were in room_4, not room_3, and not holding anything. But later, in step9, they pick up red_ball_1. So the constraint is satisfied because after step7, in step9, they are holding an object. So the fourth constraint is satisfied.

But wait, the fourth constraint says that if they are in front of purple_door_2 in some state s, then either in s or some state after s, they are in room_3 or holding an object. So in the plan, after step7 (s), they later (step9) hold an object. So that's okay. However, in this plan, step9 is after step7. But do we need to pick up the red_ball_1? Because the goal requires that the agent is in front of it, but if they are in front of it without picking it up, that's okay. So steps:

1. gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3

2. toggle red_door_1

3. gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1

4. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_4

5. toggle yellow_door_1

6. gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_1

7. gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_2

8. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_4

But in this case, step7 is being in front of purple_door_2 (satisfies constraint 3). Then step8 is moving to red_ball_1, which is allowed. Then the agent is in front of red_ball_1, which is in room_4, and the agent is in room_4. So the goal is achieved. But after step7, the agent is not holding anything. However, step8 is going to red_ball_1, which is in room_4. Then the agent is in front of it. So in this plan, after step7, the agent doesn't hold anything, but the fourth constraint requires that in s (step7) or after, they are in room_3 or holding something. They are not in room_3, but after step7, they don't hold anything. So this plan would violate the fourth constraint. Therefore, after step7, the agent must either go to room_3 (which they can't, since they are in room_4) or pick up an object.

Thus, after step7, the agent needs to pick up an object. But if they pick up red_ball_1, then it's no longer in room_4, which would fail the goal. So maybe the agent should pick up yellow_ball_1 instead. Let's adjust the plan:

7. gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_2

8. gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_4

9. pick yellow_ball_1 room_4

10. drop yellow_ball_1 room_4 (but why drop it? Maybe not necessary. The constraint just requires that at some point after step7, the agent is holding an object. So step9 satisfies that. Then, after that, the agent can drop it and proceed to the goal.

But the goal requires that the red_ball_1 is in room_4. So if the agent picks up yellow_ball_1, then drops it again, that's okay. So:

After step9 (holding yellow_ball_1), the agent can:

10. gotoempty (to move away)

11. drop yellow_ball_1 room_4 (but why? Maybe not necessary. Alternatively, after picking up yellow_ball_1 in step9, the agent can go to red_ball_1 and be in front of it. But since the agent is holding yellow_ball_1, they can't pick up red_ball_1. So they need to drop yellow_ball_1 first.

Wait, the goal is to have a red ball in room_4 (which it already is), and the agent in room_4 in front of it. So if the agent is holding yellow_ball_1, they can't be in front of red_ball_1 unless they drop the yellow_ball_1. So steps:

9. pick yellow_ball_1 room_4

10. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_4 (but can't, because to gotoobject, they need to be in the same room, which they are, but they are holding yellow_ball_1. Wait, the preconditions for gotoobject are that you are in the same room as x. So the agent can go to red_ball_1 even if holding another object. The only precondition for gotoobject is being in the same room. So:

After step9 (holding yellow_ball_1):

10. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_4 (allowed because they are in room_4)

11. drop yellow_ball_1 room_4 (but the drop action requires that the agent is holding the object to drop. So step11 would be "drop yellow_ball_1 room_4". Then, the agent is in front of yellow_ball_1 (after dropping), but the goal requires being in front of red_ball_1. So after step10, the agent is in front of red_ball_1, but still holding yellow_ball_1. Wait, no. The gotoobject action would put the agent in front of red_ball_1. Then, to drop yellow_ball_1, the agent needs to be in front of an empty position. Because drop requires that the position in front is empty. So:

After step10 (in front of red_ball_1), the agent is holding yellow_ball_1. To drop it, they need to be in front of an empty position. So:

11. gotoempty (moves to empty spot)

12. drop yellow_ball_1 room_4

13. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_4 (now, agent is in front of red_ball_1, not holding anything)

This seems complicated. Alternatively, after step7 (in front of purple_door_2), the agent could immediately pick up an object in room_4. Let's see:

7. gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_2

8. gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_4

9. pick yellow_ball_1 room_4 (now holding it)

10. gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_2 (again? Or gotoempty)

But then, the agent is holding an object, which satisfies the constraint. Then, to reach the goal:

11. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_4 (can't pick it up because already holding yellow_ball_1)

12. drop yellow_ball_1 room_4 (requires being in front of empty spot)

So:

11. gotoempty

12. drop yellow_ball_1 room_4

13. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_4

Now, in step13, the agent is in front of red_ball_1, which is in room_4, and the agent is in room_4. So the goal is achieved. But this adds several steps. However, the constraints are satisfied. But is there a shorter way?

Alternative approach: After reaching room_4 (step6), go to purple_door_2 (step7), then immediately pick up an object (like red_ball_1), but that would remove it from room_4, which is needed for the goal. So can't do that. Instead, pick up yellow_ball_1, then drop it somewhere else, then go to red_ball_1.

But this adds steps. Let's count the steps in the original plan:

Original plan steps (without considering purple_door_2):

1. gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3

2. toggle red_door_1

3. gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1

4. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_4

5. toggle yellow_door_1

6. gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_1

7. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_4

That's 7 steps. But this doesn't satisfy the third and fourth constraints. So we need to add steps to go to purple_door_2 and handle the constraints.

So integrating that:

After step6 (in room_4):

7. gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_2

8. gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_4

9. pick yellow_ball_1 room_4 (now holding it, satisfying constraint 4)

10. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_4 (can't pick up, but just moving in front of it)

But step10 requires being in the same room as red_ball_1, which is room_4. The agent is in room_4 and can perform gotoobject. So after step10, the agent is in front of red_ball_1, holding yellow_ball_1. The goal requires being in front of red_ball_1, which is achieved. However, the red_ball_1 is still in room_4 because it hasn't been picked up. The agent is in room_4, in front of red_ball_1, and holding yellow_ball_1. But the goal doesn't require the agent to not be holding anything, so that's acceptable. However, the problem statement says the agent must be in front of v (the red_ball_1) and v must be in room_4. Since the agent hasn't picked up red_ball_1, it's still there. So the goal is achieved. But the agent is holding yellow_ball_1. The problem doesn't say anything about not holding objects, so that's okay. However, the drop action may not be necessary. 

But wait, the fourth constraint requires that after being in front of purple_door_2 (step7), the agent is either in room_3 or holding an object at or after that state. In this case, step9 (holding yellow_ball_1) occurs after step7, so the constraint is satisfied. Thus, steps 7-10 would satisfy all constraints and the goal. So the plan would be:

1. gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3

2. toggle red_door_1

3. gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1

4. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_4

5. toggle yellow_door_1

6. gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_1

7. gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_2

8. gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_4

9. pick yellow_ball_1 room_4

10. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_4

This plan has 10 steps. But wait, after step10, the agent is in front of red_ball_1, which is in room_4, and the agent is in room_4. So the goal is achieved. However, the agent is holding yellow_ball_1. The goal doesn't require the agent to not be holding anything, so this is acceptable. Also, all constraints are met:

- red_door_1 was toggled (step2) to unlock.

- Never in room_2.

- In front of purple_door_2 (step7).

- After step7, the agent picks up yellow_ball_1 (step9), so they are holding an object after step7.

This seems to work.

But is there a shorter plan? Let's see. Can we combine steps? For example, after step7, instead of going to yellow_ball_1, maybe the agent can just pick up any object. But in room_4, there's red_ball_1 and yellow_ball_1. If the agent picks up red_ball_1, then the goal is not met because the red_ball_1 is no longer in room_4. So they can't do that. Hence, must pick up yellow_ball_1.

Alternatively, after step7, the agent can pick up yellow_ball_1 and then immediately drop it, but that would add steps. However, the agent needs to be in front of red_ball_1 in the end. So the plan as above is necessary.

Another thought: After step7, the agent is in front of purple_door_2. Then, they can just perform a "pick" action if there's an object there. But according to the initial state, the objects in room_4 are red_ball_1 and yellow_ball_1. If the agent is in front of purple_door_2, which is in room_4, but there's no object there. So they can't pick anything up unless they move to the object. Hence, the steps are necessary.

Alternatively, maybe the agent can go to purple_door_2 first when in room_3. Wait, purple_door_2 connects room_2 and room_4. The agent is in room_3. Can they go to purple_door_2 from room_3? No, because purple_door_2 connects room_2 and room_4. The agent is in room_3, which is not connected to purple_door_2. So the only way to get in front of purple_door_2 is from room_4 or room_2. But the agent can't go to room_2.

Thus, the only way is from room_4.

So the plan as outlined is valid. Let's check each action's preconditions:

1. gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3: agent is in room_1, which is connected via red_door_1. Assuming no object blocking, which we think is okay.

2. toggle red_door_1: agent is in front of it, so allowed.

3. gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1: door is now unlocked.

4. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_4: agent in room_3, connected via yellow_door_1, assuming no object blocking.

5. toggle yellow_door_1: in front of it.

6. gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_1: door unlocked.

7. gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_2: agent in room_4, connected via purple_door_2. No object blocking.

8. gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_4: in same room.

9. pick yellow_ball_1 room_4: not holding anything.

10. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_4: in same room.

So all preconditions are met. The effects:

After step9, yellow_ball_1 is being held, so it's no longer in room_4. But the goal requires that the red_ball_1 is in room_4, which it still is. The agent is in front of red_ball_1 in step10, which meets the goal.

But wait, after picking up yellow_ball_1 (step9), the agent is no longer in front of it. Then, step10 is moving to red_ball_1, which is allowed. So the final state is agent in room_4, in front of red_ball_1, holding yellow_ball_1. The goal doesn't specify anything about other balls, just that there exists a red ball in room_4 (which is true), and the agent is in front of it. So this works.

But the problem statement says the goal is: "There is a ball v such that the following conditions are all true: v is red, v is in room_4, you are in room_4, you are in front of v". So v is red_ball_1, which is in room_4. The agent is in room_4 and in front of it. So even if the agent is holding another ball, the goal is still satisfied.

Thus, this plan is valid and meets all constraints. However, can we optimize it?

Alternative approach: After step6 (in room_4), the agent goes to purple_door_2 (step7), then picks up yellow_ball_1 (steps8-9), then goes to red_ball_1 (step10). Alternatively, after step7, the agent can pick up yellow_ball_1 directly from purple_door_2's position. But how? To pick up an object, the agent needs to be in front of it. So they need to go from purple_door_2 to yellow_ball_1's position. Hence, steps8 and9 are necessary.

Another way: Could the agent pick up an object before going to purple_door_2? For example, after entering room_4 (step6), go to yellow_ball_1, pick it up, then go to purple_door_2. But then, when the agent is in front of purple_door_2 (step8), they are holding an object, which satisfies the fourth constraint. Then, proceed to red_ball_1. But would that be shorter?

Let's see:

6. gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_1

7. gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_4

8. pick yellow_ball_1 room_4

9. gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_2

10. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_4

This plan is 10 steps as well. Same length. But the order of steps7-9 may vary.

Alternatively, after entering room_4 (step6), go to purple_door_2 (step7), then pick up yellow_ball_1 (steps8-9), then goto red_ball_1 (step10). Same number of steps.

So the plan length is the same. However, perhaps there's a way to merge some steps. For example, if after toggling yellow_door_1 (step5), the agent can go to room_4 (step6), then goto purple_door_2 (step7), then pick up yellow_ball_1 (steps8-9), then goto red_ball_1 (step10). No way to shorten this.

Is there a way to satisfy the purple_door_2 constraint earlier? For example, while in room_3, can the agent go to purple_door_2? No, because purple_door_2 connects room_2 and room_4. The agent is in room_3, so can't access purple_door_2.

Another thought: What if the agent, after unlocking red_door_1 and entering room_3, unlocks yellow_door_1, then goes back to room_1, then to room_3 again. But that would add steps and not help.

Alternatively, after unlocking yellow_door_1, can the agent go to room_4, then immediately return to room_3 to do something. But that would add steps.

So the minimal plan is likely the 10-step one. However, let's check if any steps can be removed.

Wait, in the initial plan, step1 is gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3. But the agent starts in room_1. The preconditions for gotodoor require that the agent is in a room connected by the door and that there's no object blocking. We assumed that blue_ball_1 is not blocking the door. But what if blue_ball_1 is blocking the door? Then the agent cannot perform step1 until they move the ball. So the initial plan may not be valid.

Ah, this is a critical point. The problem's initial state doesn't specify the positions of objects relative to doors. However, the presence of blue_ball_1 in room_1 means that if the agent needs to go to red_door_1, but blue_ball_1 is blocking the position in front of the door, then the agent cannot perform gotodoor until the ball is moved. Therefore, we must account for this possibility.

Thus, the agent must first move blue_ball_1 away from the door. So the steps would be:

1. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_1

2. pick blue_ball_1 room_1

3. gotoempty (to move away from the door's position)

4. gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3

5. toggle red_door_1

6. gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1

Then proceed as before. This adds three steps (1-3). But this would make the plan longer. However, if blue_ball_1 is blocking the door, then this is necessary. But the problem statement does not specify that any object is blocking a door. So this is ambiguous. But according to the problem's description, the initial state does not mention any object blocking a door, so we can assume that the doors are not blocked. Therefore, the agent can go directly to the door. Hence, the initial plan without steps1-3 is valid.

But to be safe, perhaps the problem assumes that objects are not blocking doors unless specified. Therefore, the original plan is valid. So the answer is as follows.
