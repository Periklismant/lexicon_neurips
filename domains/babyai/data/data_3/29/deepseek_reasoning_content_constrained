Okay, let's tackle this planning problem step by step. The goal is to find a sequence of actions that meets the final goal and all constraints. Let me start by understanding the problem thoroughly.

First, the initial state: The agent is in room_4. All doors are initially locked. The objects are distributed in various rooms. The final goal is to have a blue door d connecting room_1 and room_2, the agent in front of d, and d unlocked. Additionally, there are constraints: never be in room_2, at some point hold yellow_box_2, and always keep purple_door_1 locked.

Let's break down the goal. The door d must be blue, connect room_1 and room_2, and be unlocked with the agent in front of it. Looking at the doors, blue_door_1 connects room_1 and room_2. So d is blue_door_1. The problem is that blue_door_1 is initially locked. So the agent needs to get to blue_door_1, unlock it, but the agent starts in room_4. However, moving from room_4 to room_1 requires passing through other rooms, but there's a constraint that the agent can never be in room_2. Let's check the connections.

Rooms are connected as follows:
- room_1 connects to room_2 (blue_door_1) and room_3 (red_door_1).
- room_2 connects to room_4 (purple_door_1).
- room_3 connects to room_4 (blue_door_2).
- room_4 connects to room_2 and room_3.

But the agent can't enter room_2 at any point. So the path from room_4 must go through room_3 to room_1. Let's see: from room_4, the doors are purple_door_1 (to room_2, which is forbidden) and blue_door_2 (to room_3). So the agent can go from room_4 to room_3 via blue_door_2. Then from room_3, red_door_1 connects to room_1. But red_door_1 is locked. So the agent needs to unlock red_door_1 first.

Wait, but the goal is to unlock blue_door_1. However, the agent can't go through room_2. So how to reach blue_door_1? Because blue_door_1 is between room_1 and room_2, but the agent can't go to room_2. So the agent must be in room_1 and approach blue_door_1 from room_1's side. So the plan should involve getting to room_1, then going to blue_door_1, toggling it to unlock.

But to get to room_1 from room_4, the path would be room_4 -> room_3 via blue_door_2 (needs to unlock blue_door_2 first?), then room_3 -> room_1 via red_door_1 (which is locked). Wait, but initially all doors are locked, so the agent can't move through any doors unless they are unlocked. So the agent needs to toggle the doors to unlock them. But to toggle a door, the agent must be in front of it. However, to be in front of a door, the agent must be in a room that the door connects. For example, to toggle red_door_1, the agent must be in room_1 or room_3 and go in front of red_door_1.

Wait, the agent starts in room_4. From room_4, the doors available are purple_door_1 (connects to room_2, which is forbidden) and blue_door_2 (connects to room_3). So the agent can go to blue_door_2 from room_4. But blue_door_2 is locked. So first, the agent needs to go in front of blue_door_2 in room_4, then toggle it to unlock. Then use gotoroom to move to room_3 via blue_door_2.

But wait, the preconditions for gotoroom are that the door is unlocked. So steps would be:

1. In room_4, go to blue_door_2 (gotodoor blue_door_2 room_4 room_3). But to do that, need to check if there's any object blocking the position in front of the door in room_4. The initial state doesn't mention any objects blocking doors. The objects in room_4 are yellow_box_3. Unless yellow_box_3 is in front of the door. But the problem description doesn't specify positions, so I assume that unless stated otherwise, objects are not blocking doors. So the agent can go to blue_door_2 in room_4.

2. Toggle blue_door_2 to unlock it.

3. Use gotoroom to move from room_4 to room_3 via blue_door_2.

Once in room_3, the agent can go to red_door_1 (which connects room_3 and room_1). But red_door_1 is locked. So the agent needs to unlock it.

But to do that, the agent must be in front of red_door_1. So in room_3, gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1. Then toggle it to unlock. Then move to room_1 via red_door_1.

Once in room_1, the agent can go to blue_door_1 (which connects room_1 and room_2). Then toggle it to unlock. But the goal is to have blue_door_1 unlocked and be in front of it. So after unlocking, the agent is already in front of it. So the steps would be:

But wait, the agent is in room_1. To go to blue_door_1, which is in room_1 (since it connects room_1 and room_2). So gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2. Then toggle to unlock.

But there's a constraint that the agent must never be in room_2. So going to the door in room_1 is allowed, as long as they don't enter room_2. So that's okay.

Now, the agent needs to reach room_1. Let's outline the steps:

From room_4:

1. gotodoor blue_door_2 room_4 room_3
2. toggle blue_door_2 (unlocks it)
3. gotoroom room_4 room_3 blue_door_2 (now in room_3)
4. gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1
5. toggle red_door_1 (unlocks it)
6. gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1 (now in room_1)
7. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2
8. toggle blue_door_1 (unlocks it)

At this point, the agent is in front of blue_door_1 (since step 7 is gotodoor, which places them in front of it), and the door is unlocked. That meets the goal.

But there's another constraint: the agent must hold yellow_box_2 at least once. yellow_box_2 is in room_3. So the agent must pick it up during the plan.

So when the agent is in room_3 (after step 3), they can go to yellow_box_2, pick it up, then perhaps drop it later. But the constraint is that in at least one state, the agent is holding it. So the plan must include picking up yellow_box_2, then possibly dropping it.

But when moving between rooms, the agent must not be holding anything, because to use gotoroom, do they need to be holding something? The action gotoroom doesn't mention anything about carrying objects. So the agent can carry objects while moving. However, when dropping, they need to be in front of an empty position.

So during the trip from room_3 to room_1, the agent could carry yellow_box_2, but they need to pick it up in room_3.

So modifying the plan:

After step 3 (agent is in room_3), they need to:

a. gotoobject yellow_box_2 room_3 (since they are in room_3)
b. pick yellow_box_2 room_3 (now holding it)
Then proceed to step 4 (gotodoor red_door_1...), but the agent is holding yellow_box_2. Then, when moving to room_1, they can still carry it. Then, after step 6 (in room_1), they need to drop it somewhere. But the constraint is that they must have held it at least once. So even if they pick it up and then drop it in room_3, that's okay.

Wait, but if they pick it up in room_3, and then proceed to go to red_door_1, then toggle, then go to room_1. But they can carry it through. However, when they want to drop it, they need to be in front of an empty position. Maybe after unlocking blue_door_1, they can drop it in room_1. But the problem is, the goal doesn't require dropping it. The constraint is that they must have held it at least once. So as long as they pick it up at some point, even if they don't drop it, but the problem is that when they perform other actions like toggle, they need to be in front of the door, which requires moving. So perhaps after picking up yellow_box_2 in room_3, they can carry it to room_1, then during the process, they have to drop it somewhere to proceed.

Alternatively, maybe after picking it up in room_3, they can drop it immediately. Let's see.

So steps after arriving in room_3 (step 3):

3.5: gotoobject yellow_box_2 room_3
3.6: pick yellow_box_2 room_3
3.7: gotoempty (to drop it)
3.8: drop yellow_box_2 room_3

But this way, the agent holds it in steps 3.6-3.8, satisfying the "at least once" constraint. Then proceed to step 4.

But this adds more steps. However, the problem requires an optimal plan (shortest possible). So maybe the agent can carry the box through the doors, but they need to make sure that when they drop it, they do so in a valid way.

Alternatively, perhaps after picking up yellow_box_2 in room_3, they carry it to room_1, then when they are in room_1, they can drop it. Let's see:

After step 6, the agent is in room_1, holding yellow_box_2. Then, before going to blue_door_1, they need to drop it. Because to perform gotodoor, they need to be in the same room as the door. So they can drop it in room_1.

So steps:

6. gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1 (now in room_1, holding yellow_box_2)
7. gotoempty (room_1)
8. drop yellow_box_2 room_1
9. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2
10. toggle blue_door_1

This adds steps 7-8. But the agent needs to drop the box to be able to perform gotodoor, since when you drop, you are in front of the object. Wait, no. After dropping, you are in front of the object. So after step 8, the agent is in front of yellow_box_2 in room_1. Then they need to go to blue_door_1. But to do that, they can do gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2, which requires being in room_1. Which they are. But if there's an object blocking the door's front position, but the initial state doesn't mention that. So assuming that the drop position is not blocking the door.

But maybe the plan can be optimized by not dropping the box. Wait, the pick action's effect says that after picking, the object is no longer in the room and not blocking any door. So if yellow_box_2 was blocking a door in room_3, picking it up would unblock it. But the initial state doesn't mention any objects blocking doors. So perhaps no doors are blocked by objects. So the agent can carry the box through doors.

Wait, the problem statement says that "there is no object blocking the position in front of d in the room you are currently in" is a precondition for gotodoor. So if an object is in front of a door in a room, you can't go to that door. But the initial state doesn't say any objects are blocking doors, so the agent can go to doors as needed.

So if the agent picks up yellow_box_2 in room_3, then proceeds to room_1, still holding it, then goes to blue_door_1 in room_1, then toggles it. But to toggle, the agent must be in front of the door. When they do gotodoor, they can be holding the box. The preconditions for gotodoor don't mention anything about holding objects. So yes, they can be holding the box while moving to the door and toggling it.

Therefore, the optimal plan would include:

After arriving in room_3 (step 3):

4. gotoobject yellow_box_2 room_3
5. pick yellow_box_2 room_3
6. gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1
7. toggle red_door_1 (unlocks it)
8. gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1 (now in room_1, holding yellow_box_2)
9. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2
10. toggle blue_door_1 (unlocks it)

At this point, the agent is in front of blue_door_1 in room_1, which is blue, connects room_1 and room_2, and is unlocked. The constraints are:

- Never in room_2: check, since agent is in room_1.

- At least once holding yellow_box_2: steps 5-10 have the agent holding it.

- Purple_door_1 remains locked: the agent never interacts with purple_door_1, which is in room_2 and room_4. Since the agent starts in room_4, and moves to room_3 via blue_door_2, which is unlocked. Purple_door_1 is in room_4 and room_2. The agent never toggles it, so it stays locked. So the constraint is satisfied.

So the steps would be:

1. gotodoor blue_door_2 room_4 room_3
2. toggle blue_door_2
3. gotoroom room_4 room_3 blue_door_2
4. gotoobject yellow_box_2 room_3
5. pick yellow_box_2 room_3
6. gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1
7. toggle red_door_1
8. gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1
9. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2
10. toggle blue_door_1

But wait, after step 5, the agent is holding yellow_box_2. Then they need to go to red_door_1 in room_3. To do that, they perform gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1 (step 6). Then toggle (step7). Then gotoroom to room_1 (step8). Then in room_1, gotodoor blue_door_1 (step9), toggle (step10).

This plan has 10 steps. But maybe there's a shorter way. Let me check again.

Alternative approach: After unlocking blue_door_2, moving to room_3, then immediately moving to red_door_1, unlock it, go to room_1, then go to blue_door_1 and unlock. But to satisfy the constraint of holding yellow_box_2, the agent must pick it up. So they need to go to yellow_box_2 in room_3, pick it up, then proceed.

Is there a way to pick up yellow_box_2 without adding extra steps? For example, after arriving in room_3 (step3), the agent can go to yellow_box_2 (step4), pick it (step5), then go to red_door_1 (step6), toggle (step7), go to room_1 (step8), then go to blue_door_1 (step9), toggle (step10). So 10 steps. Is there a way to merge any steps?

Wait, step3 is gotoroom from room4 to room3. Then step4 is gotoobject yellow_box_2 in room3. Then pick. Then step6 is gotodoor red_door_1. Then toggle. Then gotoroom to room1. Then gotodoor blue_door_1, toggle.

Alternatively, maybe after picking yellow_box_2, the agent can carry it to room1 and then drop it, but that would require more steps. However, since the constraint only requires holding it at least once, carrying it until the end is okay as long as it doesn't interfere with other actions.

But the drop action is not needed unless required by some other constraint. The problem states that the agent can carry the box through all steps. So the plan as above (10 steps) is valid.

Now, check if all preconditions are met.

Step1: gotodoor blue_door_2 room4 room3. Agent is in room4, blue_door_2 connects room4 and room3. No object blocking, so allowed. After this, agent is in front of blue_door_2.

Step2: toggle blue_door_2. Precondition: in front of it. Yes. Now blue_door_2 is unlocked.

Step3: gotoroom room4 room3 blue_door_2. Agent moves to room3. Now in room3.

Step4: gotoobject yellow_box_2 room3. Agent is in room3, so allowed.

Step5: pick yellow_box_2 room3. Preconditions: in same room, not holding anything. After step4, agent is in front of yellow_box_2. Picking it up.

Step6: gotodoor red_door_1 room3 room1. Agent is in room3, red_door_1 connects room3 and room1. No object blocking, allowed. Now in front of red_door_1.

Step7: toggle red_door_1. Unlocks it.

Step8: gotoroom room3 room1 red_door_1. Agent moves to room1.

Step9: gotodoor blue_door_1 room1 room2. Agent is in room1, blue_door_1 connects room1 and room2. No object blocking.

Step10: toggle blue_door_1. Now it's unlocked. Agent is in front of blue_door_1.

This meets the goal. All constraints are satisfied:

- Never in room2.

- Held yellow_box_2 from step5 onwards.

- Purple_door_1 remains locked as it was never touched.

So the plan is valid. Now check for possible shorter plans. For example, can the agent avoid picking up the box until after unlocking red_door_1?

Wait, after step3 (in room3), the agent can go to red_door_1, unlock it, then go to room1. Then come back to room3 to pick up the box. But that would add steps. Alternatively, perhaps after step8 (in room1), go back to room3 to pick up the box, but that would require moving through the door again. Not optimal.

Alternatively, maybe the agent can pick up the box after unlocking red_door_1 but before moving to room1. Let's see:

Alternative steps:

3. gotoroom room4 to room3.

4. gotodoor red_door_1.

5. toggle red_door_1 (unlock).

6. gotoroom room3 to room1.

But then the agent is in room1. They need to get back to room3 to pick up the box, which adds steps. So not better.

So the original plan with 10 steps seems optimal.

Wait, but in the initial plan, after step3 (gotoroom to room3), the agent needs to go to yellow_box_2 (step4), pick it (step5), then go to red_door_1 (step6), toggle (step7), then go to room1 (step8). Then go to blue_door_1 (step9), toggle (step10). That's 10 steps. But maybe step4 can be merged with an action.

Wait, when the agent arrives in room3 (step3), they are not in front of any object or door. So they need to gotoobject to pick up the box. So steps are necessary.

Another thought: can the agent pick up the box and then proceed to unlock red_door_1? Yes, but that requires being in front of red_door_1. So after picking up the box, they need to go to red_door_1.

Yes, that's what's done in steps6 and7.

I think this is the minimal number of steps. Let's count again:

1. gotodoor blue_door_2 room4 room3

2. toggle blue_door_2

3. gotoroom room4 room3 blue_door_2

4. gotoobject yellow_box_2 room3

5. pick yellow_box_2 room3

6. gotodoor red_door_1 room3 room1

7. toggle red_door_1

8. gotoroom room3 room1 red_door_1

9. gotodoor blue_door_1 room1 room2

10. toggle blue_door_1

Yes, 10 actions. Is there any way to reduce this?

For example, after step3 (in room3), can the agent go directly to red_door_1, toggle, then go to room1, then come back to room3 to pick up the box. But that would require:

3. gotoroom to room3

4. gotodoor red_door_1

5. toggle red_door_1

6. gotoroom to room1

7. gotoempty (in room1)

8. drop (if holding something, but not here)

But this doesn't pick up the box. So they have to go back to room3, which would add steps. Not better.

Alternatively, after unlocking red_door_1, go to room1, then return to room3 to get the box, then go back to room1. But that adds steps. So the original plan seems optimal.

Another angle: The constraint for holding yellow_box_2 must be true in at least one state. So the agent can pick it up and immediately drop it. So steps could be:

4. gotoobject yellow_box_2

5. pick

6. gotoempty

7. drop

Then proceed to unlock red_door_1.

But this adds steps (6 and7), making the total steps 11. Which is longer than the original plan. So the original plan is better.

Therefore, the initial plan of 10 steps is optimal.
