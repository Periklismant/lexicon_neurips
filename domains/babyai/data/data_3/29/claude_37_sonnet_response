Alright, let's break down the problem:

We have a 2D gridworld with 4 rooms arranged in a square formation. There are doors connecting certain room pairs, and there are objects (boxes and balls) in each room. I need to find a valid sequence of actions to achieve a specific goal while abiding by certain constraints.

First, let's understand the goal: "There is a door d such that 'The following conditions are all true: "d is blue", "room_1 and room_2 are connected via d", "you are in front of d", "d is not locked"'".

This means I need to find a blue door that connects room_1 and room_2, go in front of that door, and ensure it's unlocked.

Looking at the original state, I see that blue_door_1 connects room_1 and room_2, so that's the door I need to unlock and stand in front of.

Now, let's check the constraints:

1. I can't be in room_2 at any point.
2. At some point, I need to be holding yellow_box_2.
3. purple_door_1 must remain locked throughout the plan.

Initial state: I'm in room_4. All doors are locked. The yellow_box_2 is in room_3.

Given these constraints, I need to navigate from room_4 to room_1, passing through room_3 (to pick up yellow_box_2), and then unlock blue_door_1. However, I can't enter room_2 at any point, which means I need to unlock and go through blue_door_1 from the room_1 side.

Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. Unlock blue_door_2 (connecting room_4 and room_3).
2. Go from room_4 to room_3 using blue_door_2.
3. Pick up yellow_box_2 in room_3.
4. Unlock red_door_1 (connecting room_3 and room_1).
5. Go from room_3 to room_1 using red_door_1.
6. At some point, drop yellow_box_2.
7. Go to blue_door_1 and unlock it.
8. Stand in front of blue_door_1 from the room_1 side.

Let's translate this to the action format:

1. First, I need to go to blue_door_2.
```
gotodoor blue_door_2 room_4 room_3
```

2. Unlock blue_door_2.
```
toggle blue_door_2
```

3. Go to room_3.
```
gotoroom room_4 room_3 blue_door_2
```

4. Go to yellow_box_2 in room_3.
```
gotoobject yellow_box_2 room_3
```

5. Pick up yellow_box_2.
```
pick yellow_box_2 room_3
```

6. Go to red_door_1.
```
gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1
```

7. Unlock red_door_1.
```
toggle red_door_1
```

8. Go to room_1.
```
gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1
```

9. Go to an empty position in room_1 to drop yellow_box_2.
```
gotoempty
```

10. Drop yellow_box_2.
```
drop yellow_box_2 room_1
```

11. Go to blue_door_1.
```
gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2
```

12. Unlock blue_door_1.
```
toggle blue_door_1
```

Now, at this point, I've satisfied the goal. Let's review:
- I'm in front of blue_door_1 from the room_1 side.
- blue_door_1 is now unlocked.
- blue_door_1 is blue (given in the initial state).
- blue_door_1 connects room_1 and room_2 (given in the initial state).

I've also satisfied the constraints:
- I never entered room_2 (the "gotoroom" action would be required to go into room_2, which I didn't do).
- At some point, I was holding yellow_box_2 (after step 5).
- I never unlocked purple_door_1, so it remained locked throughout the plan.

Let's finalize the plan:

```
gotodoor blue_door_2 room_4 room_3
toggle blue_door_2
gotoroom room_4 room_3 blue_door_2
gotoobject yellow_box_2 room_3
pick yellow_box_2 room_3
gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1
toggle red_door_1
gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1
gotoempty
drop yellow_box_2 room_1
gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2
toggle blue_door_1
```

Let me double-check the plan: 

Start: I'm in room_4, no doors are unlocked, and I'm not holding any objects.

1. gotodoor blue_door_2 room_4 room_3
   - I'm now in front of blue_door_2 in room_4.

2. toggle blue_door_2
   - I've unlocked blue_door_2.

3. gotoroom room_4 room_3 blue_door_2
   - I've moved from room_4 to room_3 using blue_door_2.

4. gotoobject yellow_box_2 room_3
   - I'm now in front of yellow_box_2 in room_3.

5. pick yellow_box_2 room_3
   - I've picked up yellow_box_2 and am now holding it.

6. gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1
   - I'm now in front of red_door_1 in room_3.

7. toggle red_door_1
   - I've unlocked red_door_1.

8. gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1
   - I've moved from room_3 to room_1 using red_door_1.

9. gotoempty
   - I've moved to an empty position in room_1.

10. drop yellow_box_2 room_1
    - I've dropped yellow_box_2 at the empty position in room_1.

11. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2
    - I'm now in front of blue_door_1 in room_1.

12. toggle blue_door_1
    - I've unlocked blue_door_1.

Now, let's check the goal:
- I'm in front of blue_door_1 from the room_1 side.
- blue_door_1 is now unlocked.
- blue_door_1 is blue (given in the initial state).
- blue_door_1 connects room_1 and room_2 (given in the initial state).

I've satisfied the goal.

And let's check the constraints one more time:
- I never entered room_2, as the "gotoroom" action would be required to go into room_2, which I didn't do.
- At some point, I was holding yellow_box_2 (after step 5 and before step 10).
- I never unlocked purple_door_1, so it remained locked throughout the plan.

All constraints are satisfied.

Wait, let me re-check that my plan is valid:

I realize I may have an issue. The "gotoroom" action might move me directly to a door in the destination room, rather than just to the room. If that's the case, then I might need to first go to the door in the current room, then perform the "gotoroom" action.

Let me revisit the actions and their effects:

1. gotoobject x r: Go in front of an object x in room r. 
   - Precondition: You are in the same room as x.
   - Effect: You are now in front of x.

2. gotoempty: Go in front of an empty position.
   - Precondition: None specified.
   - Effect: You are now in front of an empty position.

3. gotodoor d r1 r2: Go in front of door d connecting rooms r1 and r2.
   - Precondition: You are in a room that door d is connecting with another room, and there is no object blocking the position in front of d.
   - Effect: You are now in front of door d.

4. gotoroom r1 r2 d: Go to room r2 from room r1 using door d.
   - Precondition: You are in a room r1 adjacent to r2, and the door d connecting r1 and r2 is unlocked.
   - Effect: You are now in room r2 and are no longer in front of any object or door.

5. pick x r: Pick up object x in room r.
   - Precondition: You are in the same room as x, and you're not holding any object, and you are in front of x.
   - Effect: You are now holding x, and x is no longer in the room.

6. drop x r: Drop object x in room r.
   - Precondition: You are holding x, and the position in front of you is empty.
   - Effect: You are no longer holding x, x is now in room r, and you are in front of x.

7. toggle d: Unlock door d if it is locked, lock it if it is unlocked.
   - Precondition: You are in front of door d.
   - Effect: The lock state of door d is toggled.

Based on the above, here's a corrected plan:

1. gotodoor blue_door_2 room_4 room_3
   - I'm now in front of blue_door_2 in room_4.

2. toggle blue_door_2
   - I've unlocked blue_door_2.

3. gotoroom room_4 room_3 blue_door_2
   - I've moved from room_4 to room_3 using blue_door_2. I'm no longer in front of blue_door_2 or any other object/door.

4. gotoobject yellow_box_2 room_3
   - I'm now in front of yellow_box_2 in room_3.

5. pick yellow_box_2 room_3
   - I've picked up yellow_box_2 and am now holding it.

6. gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1
   - I'm now in front of red_door_1 in room_3.

7. toggle red_door_1
   - I've unlocked red_door_1.

8. gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1
   - I've moved from room_3 to room_1 using red_door_1. I'm no longer in front of red_door_1 or any other object/door.

9. gotoempty
   - I've moved to an empty position in room_1.

10. drop yellow_box_2 room_1
    - I've dropped yellow_box_2 at the empty position in room_1.

11. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2
    - I'm now in front of blue_door_1 in room_1.

12. toggle blue_door_1
    - I've unlocked blue_door_1.

This plan seems valid. I've satisfied the goal and all the constraints.

1. gotodoor blue_door_2 room_4 room_3
2. toggle blue_door_2
3. gotoroom room_4 room_3 blue_door_2
4. gotoobject yellow_box_2 room_3
5. pick yellow_box_2 room_3
6. gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1
7. toggle red_door_1
8. gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1
9. gotoempty
10. drop yellow_box_2 room_1
11. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2
12. toggle blue_door_1
