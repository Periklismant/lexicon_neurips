Okay, let's see. I need to find a plan that gets the agent to be in front of a green box. The initial state has the agent in room_1. The green boxes are green_box_1 in room_2, green_box_2 in room_4. Also, there are some constraints to satisfy.

First, the goal is to have a green box in front of the agent. So possible targets are green_box_1 in room_2 or green_box_2 in room_4. Let me check which one is easier to reach given the constraints.

The constraints are:

1. Yellow_door_1 must always be locked. So the agent can't unlock it. So the door between room_1 and room_2 (yellow_door_1) is locked, meaning the agent can't go through that door. So to get to room_2, the agent can't use yellow_door_1. Wait, but how else can the agent get to room_2? The other doors from room_1 are grey_door_1 connecting to room_3. Then from room_3, there's blue_door_1 to room_4, and room_4 connects to room_2 via red_door_1. But all doors are initially locked. Hmm.

Wait, the initial state says all doors (yellow, grey, red, blue) are locked. So to move between rooms, the agent needs to unlock doors. But the constraints say that yellow_door_1 must remain locked in every state. So the agent can't toggle that door. So the agent can't go from room_1 to room_2 directly via yellow_door_1. So the only way to reach room_2 is through other rooms. Let me map the possible paths.

Starting in room_1. To get to room_2, the agent would need to go through room_1 -> room_3 via grey_door_1 (needs to unlock it), then room_3 to room_4 via blue_door_1 (unlock), then room_4 to room_2 via red_door_1 (unlock). Then in room_2, the agent can access green_box_1. Alternatively, maybe go to room_4 first to get green_box_2. Let's see.

But the agent is in room_1 initially. So first, the agent needs to unlock grey_door_1 to get to room_3. Then from room_3, unlock blue_door_1 to get to room_4. Then from room_4, unlock red_door_1 to get to room_2. Each door needs to be toggled (unlocked) first. But each toggle action requires being in front of the door. So steps would involve:

1. Go to grey_door_1 in room_1 (which connects to room_3). But to do that, the agent needs to be in a room connected by the door. Since the agent is in room_1, which is connected to room_3 via grey_door_1. So the agent can go to grey_door_1. But the door is locked. So the agent needs to toggle it (unlock). Then go through to room_3. Then proceed to other rooms.

Wait, but the preconditions for gotoroom r1 r2 d: the door must be unlocked. So first, the agent needs to go to the door, toggle it (unlock), then use gotoroom.

So step-by-step plan:

From room_1:

1. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_3 (since the agent is in room_1, which is connected via grey_door_1 to room_3). But before that, check if there's any object blocking the position in front of the door. The initial state in room_1: the objects there are none except the agent. The boxes and balls are in other rooms. So the path to the door is clear. So agent can go to grey_door_1.

Action: gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_3.

Then toggle grey_door_1 to unlock it. Since it's initially locked, toggle will unlock it.

Action: toggle grey_door_1.

Now, the door is unlocked. Then use gotoroom to move to room_3.

Action: gotoroom room_1 room_3 grey_door_1.

Now in room_3. Now, need to get to room_4. The door between room_3 and room_4 is blue_door_1. It's locked initially. So agent needs to go to blue_door_1 in room_3, unlock it, then go through.

In room_3:

First, goto blue_door_1. But in room_3, the door connects to room_4. So:

Action: gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_4.

Check if the path is clear. In room_3, the objects are purple_box_1, red_ball_1, green_ball_1, yellow_box_1. Are any of these blocking the door? The problem statement doesn't specify initial positions of objects relative to doors. Wait, the initial state doesn't mention any objects blocking doors. So assuming that doors are not blocked by objects unless stated. So the agent can go to the door.

Toggle blue_door_1.

Action: toggle blue_door_1.

Then move to room_4.

Action: gotoroom room_3 room_4 blue_door_1.

Now in room_4. The green_box_2 is here. But the goal is to be in front of a green box. So if the agent is in room_4, can they just go to green_box_2 and drop it? Wait, the agent needs to be in front of a green box. But green_box_2 is already in room_4. So maybe the agent can just go to green_box_2. However, the agent is in room_4 now. To get to green_box_2, which is in room_4, the agent can gotoobject green_box_2 room_4.

But first, the agent needs to get into room_4. Then, go to the box. But wait, maybe there's a constraint that the agent must visit room_2. Let me check the constraints.

The constraints are:

- The following must hold in at least one state: "you are in room_2"

So the plan must include being in room_2 at some point. Also, another constraint says that if the agent is in room_2 in some state, then there must be an earlier state where either the agent is holding something or red_box_1 is in room_4. Initially, red_box_1 is in room_2. So unless the agent moves it, red_box_1 is in room_2. The second part of the constraint is that if the agent is in room_2, then earlier, either they were holding something or red_box_1 was in room_4. Since red_box_1 starts in room_2, unless the agent moves it to room_4, that condition would require the agent to have held something before entering room_2.

So, the agent must enter room_2, but before that, either hold an object or have moved red_box_1 to room_4. But moving red_box_1 would require picking it up and dropping in room_4. But to pick it up, the agent needs to be in room_2, which they can't reach directly from room_1 because yellow_door_1 is locked and must remain so. So maybe the agent has to go through room_4 to get to room_2.

Wait, from room_4, the agent can go to room_2 via red_door_1, which is initially locked. So the agent would need to unlock red_door_1. So after arriving in room_4 from room_3, the agent can go to red_door_1 (connecting room_4 and room_2), toggle it (unlock), then go to room_2.

But then, before entering room_2, the agent must have either held an object or red_box_1 is in room_4. But red_box_1 is in room_2. So to satisfy the constraint, when entering room_2, the agent must have held an object in a previous state.

So perhaps the agent should pick up an object in room_4 (like green_box_2) before going to room_2. Then, when entering room_2, the agent would be holding it, satisfying the constraint.

Alternatively, the agent could drop an object in room_4, but that's not necessary. Let's see.

So the plan so far:

From room_4, after arriving via blue_door_1, the agent can:

1. gotoobject green_box_2 room_4 (since it's in room_4), then pick it up. Then, proceed to unlock red_door_1 (connecting room_4 to room_2), go to room_2, which would require being in front of red_door_1, toggling it (unlock), then moving to room_2. Once in room_2, the agent can drop the green_box_2, but the goal is to be in front of a green box. So if they are holding green_box_2, they can drop it in room_2, then gotoobject. Or maybe they need to drop it in a position and then go in front of it. Wait, the goal is "there is a box v such that v is green and you are in front of v". So as long as the agent is in front of a green box, whether it's the original one or another. So if the agent takes green_box_2 from room_4 to room_2 and then drops it there, then they can gotoobject in room_2. Alternatively, maybe they can just use green_box_1 which is already in room_2. But the problem is getting to room_2 while satisfying the constraints.

But let's outline the steps:

In room_4:

1. gotoobject green_box_2 room_4. Then pick it up (since agent is not holding anything). Then, go to red_door_1 (gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2), toggle it (unlock), then gotoroom room_4 room_2 red_door_1. Now in room_2. At this point, the agent is holding green_box_2, so the constraint that when entering room_2, the agent must have held something in a prior state is satisfied. Then, drop green_box_2 in room_2 (needs to be in front of an empty position). So after dropping, they can gotoobject green_box_2 room_2, thereby being in front of it. But wait, after dropping, the agent is in front of the object (per drop effect). So maybe after dropping, the agent is already in front of the green box, satisfying the goal. Let me check the drop effect: after dropping, (i) not carrying, (ii) in front of x, (iii) hands empty, (iv) x is in current room. So if the agent drops green_box_2 in room_2, then they are in front of it. So the goal would be achieved. But the agent needs to be in front of a green box. So in that case, after dropping, the agent is in front of it. So the final action would be drop green_box_2 room_2. Then the goal is met. Let's check that.

But let's see the steps:

1. Agent is in room_4, has green_box_2.

- Need to go to red_door_1 in room_4 (gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2).

But before that, the agent is holding green_box_2. So when they perform gotodoor, they can do that while holding it. The preconditions for gotodoor are: (i) in a room connected by the door, (ii) no object blocking the position in front of d. So if the agent is in room_4, which is connected via red_door_1 to room_2, and assuming no objects are blocking, they can go to the door.

So:

Action: gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2.

Then toggle red_door_1 (unlock).

Action: toggle red_door_1.

Then, gotoroom room_4 room_2 red_door_1. Now in room_2, holding green_box_2.

Now, to drop it. The agent needs to be in front of an empty position. Wait, the drop action requires that the position in front is empty. But after moving to room_2, the agent is in front of the door (since gotoroom action makes them no longer in front of any object). Wait, after gotoroom, the agent is in room_2 but not in front of anything. So to drop, the agent needs to be in front of an empty position. So they need to do gotoempty first.

Wait, the drop action's preconditions: (i) holding x, (ii) position in front is empty. So after moving to room_2, the agent is not in front of anything (since gotoroom's effect is that they are no longer in front of anything). So to drop, they need to be in front of an empty position. So they can perform gotoempty in room_2, then drop green_box_2.

Wait, but after arriving in room_2 via gotoroom, the agent is in the room but not in front of any object. So to drop, they need to first gotoempty (which puts them in front of an empty spot), then drop.

So steps in room_2:

- After arriving, perform gotoempty.

Action: gotoempty.

Then drop green_box_2.

Action: drop green_box_2 room_2.

Now, the agent is in front of green_box_2 in room_2, which is green. So the goal is achieved.

But wait, the goal is "there is a box v such that v is green and you are in front of v". So yes, green_box_2 is green and the agent is in front of it. So this satisfies the goal.

But we need to check all constraints.

Constraints:

1. yellow_door_1 must remain locked in every state. Since the agent never toggles it, it remains locked. Good.

2. At least one state must have either purple_box_1 in room_2 or agent holding something. Let's see: in the plan, the agent picks up green_box_2 in room_4, so during that time, they are holding it. So in that state, the "you are holding some object" is true. So that satisfies the second constraint.

3. The agent must be in room_2 at some state. Yes, when they move there via red_door_1.

4. When the agent is in room_2, there must be an earlier state where either they were holding something or red_box_1 is in room_4. Since red_box_1 starts in room_2 and is not moved, the only way is that the agent was holding something earlier. Which they were (green_box_2), so this is satisfied.

So this plan would work. Now, let's check if all actions are valid.

Let's outline the full plan step by step:

1. Start in room_1.

- Need to go to grey_door_1 in room_1.

Action: gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_3.

Preconditions: in room_1 (yes), door connects room_1 and room_3 (yes), no object blocking (yes). Valid.

2. Toggle grey_door_1 (unlock).

Action: toggle grey_door_1.

Precondition: in front of grey_door_1 (yes, after gotodoor). Valid.

3. gotoroom room_1 room_3 grey_door_1.

Now in room_3.

4. In room_3, need to go to blue_door_1.

Action: gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_4.

Preconditions: in room_3, door connects to room_4, no blocking. Valid.

5. Toggle blue_door_1 (unlock).

Action: toggle blue_door_1.

6. gotoroom room_3 room_4 blue_door_1. Now in room_4.

7. In room_4, need to pick up green_box_2.

First, gotoobject green_box_2 room_4.

Action: gotoobject green_box_2 room_4.

8. pick green_box_2 room_4.

Now holding green_box_2.

9. Now, need to go to red_door_1 in room_4.

Action: gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2.

10. Toggle red_door_1 (unlock).

Action: toggle red_door_1.

11. gotoroom room_4 room_2 red_door_1. Now in room_2.

12. In room_2, need to drop green_box_2. First, gotoempty.

Action: gotoempty.

13. drop green_box_2 room_2.

Now, in front of green_box_2. Goal achieved.

Check constraints:

- All steps: yellow_door_1 remains locked. Correct.

- The agent was holding green_box_2, which satisfies the second constraint (at least one state where holding something).

- Agent is in room_2 (step 11). Correct.

- Before entering room_2 (step 11), the agent was holding green_box_2 (steps 8-11). So the fourth constraint is satisfied.

This plan seems valid. Now, check if it's optimal. Are there shorter plans?

Alternative approach: Maybe instead of taking green_box_2 from room_4 to room_2, can the agent go to room_2 via room_4, but use green_box_1 already in room_2. But how to get into room_2. But to get to room_2, the agent must go through red_door_1 from room_4. Then, once in room_2, the agent can just go to green_box_1. But in that case, the agent doesn't need to pick up anything. But then, the fourth constraint requires that when entering room_2, there's an earlier state where the agent held something or red_box_1 is in room_4. If the agent doesn't hold anything before entering room_2, then since red_box_1 is in room_2, the condition would not be met. Because the condition is that before entering room_2, either the agent held something OR red_box_1 is in room_4. But red_box_1 is in room_2, so the only way to satisfy the constraint is that the agent held something before entering room_2. So in that case, if the agent goes to room_2 without holding anything, the constraint would be violated. Hence, the agent must have held something before entering room_2. So the only way is to pick up an object (like green_box_2) and carry it to room_2.

Therefore, the plan I outlined is necessary. So it's optimal.

Is there a shorter path? Let's see. Let's count the steps. The steps are:

1. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_3

2. toggle grey_door_1

3. gotoroom room_1 room_3 grey_door_1

4. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_4

5. toggle blue_door_1

6. gotoroom room_3 room_4 blue_door_1

7. gotoobject green_box_2 room_4

8. pick green_box_2 room_4

9. gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2

10. toggle red_door_1

11. gotoroom room_4 room_2 red_door_1

12. gotoempty

13. drop green_box_2 room_2

Total 13 actions.

Alternative: After step 6, the agent is in room_4. Instead of picking up green_box_2, maybe go directly to red_door_1, but then they need to unlock it. Then go to room_2, but since they are not holding anything, the fourth constraint would not be satisfied. So they need to hold something. Hence, steps 7-8 are necessary.

Another alternative: Could the agent pick up purple_box_1 in room_3 and carry it through to room_4 and then to room_2? But purple_box_1 is in room_3. So agent could, in room_3, goto purple_box_1, pick it up, then proceed. But would that help? If they carry it to room_2, then in room_2, when they enter, they are holding it, satisfying the constraint. Then they can drop it and go to green_box_1. But this requires more steps.

Alternatively, let's see:

In room_3:

1. gotoobject purple_box_1 room_3

2. pick purple_box_1 room_3

3. proceed to room_4, then room_2. Then drop in room_2. Then goto green_box_1.

But that would require more steps than the initial plan. Because then the agent would need to drop purple_box_1, then go to green_box_1. The initial plan has the agent dropping green_box_2 in room_2, which already is a green box in front of them. So the initial plan is shorter.

Hence, the initial plan is optimal.
