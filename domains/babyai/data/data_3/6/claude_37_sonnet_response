Let me break down the planning problem:

**Initial State:**
- I am in room_1
- red_box_1 is in room_2
- green_box_1 is in room_2
- grey_box_1 is in room_2
- purple_box_1 is in room_3
- red_ball_1 is in room_3
- green_ball_1 is in room_3
- yellow_box_1 is in room_3
- green_box_2 is in room_4
- All doors are locked (yellow_door_1, grey_door_1, red_door_1, blue_door_1)
- I am not holding any object

**Goal:**
- I need to be in front of a green box

**Constraints:**
1. yellow_door_1 must always remain locked
2. At some point, either purple_box_1 must be in room_2 or I must be holding some object
3. I must be in room_2 at some point
4. Before I can be in room_2, either red_box_1 must be in room_4 or I must be holding some object

Let me think through this problem:

1. First of all, there are green boxes available: green_box_1 is in room_2 and green_box_2 is in room_4.
2. To get to either of these boxes, I need to go through doors, but all doors are locked. I need to unlock them using the "toggle" action.
3. The constraint says yellow_door_1 must remain locked, so I can't use that to go between room_1 and room_2.
4. I need to be in room_2 at some point (constraint 3).
5. Before I can be in room_2, I need to either move red_box_1 to room_4 or hold some object (constraint 4).
6. I also need to satisfy constraint 2 at some point: either have purple_box_1 in room_2 or be holding some object.

Given these constraints, I need to:

A. Unlock doors (except yellow_door_1) to navigate between rooms.
B. Figure out a way to get to room_2 while satisfying constraint 4.
C. Satisfy constraint 2 at some point in my plan.
D. End up in front of a green box.

Let's plan step by step:

I'll start in room_1. I need to go to either room_3 or room_2 to get to a green box.

If I try to go to room_2:
- I can't use yellow_door_1 (constraint 1).
- I'd need to go through room_3 and room_4 and into room_2 using red_door_1.
- Before entering room_2, I need to satisfy constraint 4, which means either moving red_box_1 to room_4 or holding some object.

This seems doable. Let's outline my plan:

1. From room_1, go to the grey_door_1, unlock it, and go to room_3.
2. In room_3, I can pick up any object (e.g., purple_box_1) to satisfy constraint 4 (holding an object).
3. Go to blue_door_1, unlock it, and go to room_4.
4. Go to red_door_1, unlock it, and go to room_2.
5. At this point, I've satisfied constraint 3 (being in room_2) and constraint 4 (held an object before entering room_2).
6. If I'm still holding the object, I've satisfied constraint 2.
7. Now, I need to go in front of green_box_1 in room_2 to satisfy the goal.

Let's refine the plan with the exact actions:

1. `gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_3` (Go in front of the door connecting room_1 and room_3)
2. `toggle grey_door_1` (Unlock the door)
3. `gotoroom room_1 room_3 grey_door_1` (Go to room_3)
4. `gotoobject purple_box_1 room_3` (Go in front of purple_box_1 in room_3)
5. `pick purple_box_1 room_3` (Pick up purple_box_1, satisfying constraint 2 and 4)
6. `gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_4` (Go in front of the door connecting room_3 and room_4)
7. `toggle blue_door_1` (Unlock the door)
8. `gotoroom room_3 room_4 blue_door_1` (Go to room_4)
9. `gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2` (Go in front of the door connecting room_4 and room_2)
10. `toggle red_door_1` (Unlock the door)
11. `gotoroom room_4 room_2 red_door_1` (Go to room_2, satisfying constraint 3)
12. `gotoempty` (Go to an empty position to prepare for dropping the object)
13. `drop purple_box_1 room_2` (Drop purple_box_1, satisfying constraint 2)
14. `gotoobject green_box_1 room_2` (Go in front of green_box_1, satisfying the goal)

Wait, I need to double check if this plan meets all the constraints:

1. yellow_door_1 is locked: Yes, I never use or toggle this door.
2. At some point, either purple_box_1 is in room_2 or I am holding some object: Yes, I hold purple_box_1 and also drop it in room_2, so both conditions are met.
3. I am in room_2 at some point: Yes, I go to room_2 in step 11.
4. Before I am in room_2, either red_box_1 is in room_4 or I am holding some object: Yes, I'm holding purple_box_1 before entering room_2.

Now let me check if all the action preconditions are met:

1. `gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_3`: I am in room_1, and grey_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3.
2. `toggle grey_door_1`: I am in front of grey_door_1.
3. `gotoroom room_1 room_3 grey_door_1`: I am in front of grey_door_1, which is now unlocked.
4. `gotoobject purple_box_1 room_3`: I am in room_3, and purple_box_1 is in room_3.
5. `pick purple_box_1 room_3`: I am in front of purple_box_1 in room_3, and my hands are empty.
6. `gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_4`: I am in room_3, and blue_door_1 connects room_3 and room_4.
7. `toggle blue_door_1`: I am in front of blue_door_1.
8. `gotoroom room_3 room_4 blue_door_1`: I am in front of blue_door_1, which is now unlocked.
9. `gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2`: I am in room_4, and red_door_1 connects room_4 and room_2.
10. `toggle red_door_1`: I am in front of red_door_1.
11. `gotoroom room_4 room_2 red_door_1`: I am in front of red_door_1, which is now unlocked.
12. `gotoempty`: I can go to an empty position anytime.
13. `drop purple_box_1 room_2`: I am holding purple_box_1, and the position in front of me is empty.
14. `gotoobject green_box_1 room_2`: I am in room_2, and green_box_1 is in room_2.

All the preconditions are met, and the plan satisfies all the constraints and achieves the goal. 

However, I just realized that I didn't explicitly consider the effects of the actions. Let me check if the sequence of actions makes sense in terms of effects:

1. `gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_3`: I am now in front of grey_door_1.
2. `toggle grey_door_1`: grey_door_1 is now unlocked.
3. `gotoroom room_1 room_3 grey_door_1`: I am now in room_3 and no longer in front of grey_door_1.
4. `gotoobject purple_box_1 room_3`: I am now in front of purple_box_1.
5. `pick purple_box_1 room_3`: I am no longer in front of purple_box_1, but I am carrying it. My hands are no longer empty. purple_box_1 is no longer in room_3.
6. `gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_4`: I am now in front of blue_door_1 (and still holding purple_box_1).
7. `toggle blue_door_1`: blue_door_1 is now unlocked (and I'm still holding purple_box_1).
8. `gotoroom room_3 room_4 blue_door_1`: I am now in room_4 and no longer in front of blue_door_1 (and still holding purple_box_1).
9. `gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2`: I am now in front of red_door_1 (and still holding purple_box_1).
10. `toggle red_door_1`: red_door_1 is now unlocked (and I'm still holding purple_box_1).
11. `gotoroom room_4 room_2 red_door_1`: I am now in room_2 and no longer in front of red_door_1 (and still holding purple_box_1).
12. `gotoempty`: I am now in front of an empty position (and still holding purple_box_1).
13. `drop purple_box_1 room_2`: I am no longer carrying purple_box_1. My hands are empty. I am in front of purple_box_1. purple_box_1 is now in room_2.
14. `gotoobject green_box_1 room_2`: I am now in front of green_box_1 (which is green).

Great, the sequence of actions and their effects make sense. This plan satisfies the goal (I am in front of a green box) and all the constraints.

Let me look for possible optimizations:

The current plan has 14 steps. Let's see if we can reduce the number of steps:

1. We need to go from room_1 to room_2 while holding an object (to satisfy constraint 4).
2. We need to have purple_box_1 in room_2 or be holding some object at some point (to satisfy constraint 2).

One optimization could be to pick up a different object that might be closer to our path. However, the plan involves picking up purple_box_1, which directly satisfies constraint 2 when we drop it in room_2. If we pick up a different object, we'd still need to satisfy constraint 2 somehow.

I don't see any obvious way to shorten the path or reduce the number of steps while still satisfying all the constraints and achieving the goal.

However, there's one thing I'd like to double-check: I'm not sure if `gotoempty` is necessary before dropping purple_box_1. Let me reread the preconditions for the drop action:

"drop": you may only drop an object x if (i) you are currently holding x, and (ii) the position in front of you is empty.

After I go to room_2, I'm no longer in front of red_door_1, as per the effect of `gotoroom`. So, the position in front of me could be empty. But the `gotoroom` action's effects are a bit vague about where I end up in the room. To be safe, I should use `gotoempty` to ensure I'm in front of an empty position.

Actually, let me revisit the problem a bit more systematically. Let's consider the goal: I need to be in front of a green box. There are two green boxes: green_box_1 in room_2 and green_box_2 in room_4.

Route to green_box_1 in room_2:
1. Go from room_1 to room_2.
2. Since yellow_door_1 must remain locked, I need to go through room_3 and room_4 to get to room_2.
3. Before entering room_2, I need to satisfy constraint 4, which means either moving red_box_1 to room_4 or holding some object.

Route to green_box_2 in room_4:
1. Go from room_1 to room_3 to room_4.
2. Since I will not be going to room_2 in this route, I don't need to satisfy constraint 4.
3. However, I still need to satisfy constraint 3, which means I need to be in room_2 at some point.

Comparing the two routes, the route to green_box_1 seems simpler because it naturally includes a visit to room_2 (satisfying constraint 3) and requires satisfying constraint 4, which aligns with picking up an object along the way (which can help satisfy constraint 2). The route to green_box_2 would require an additional visit to room_2, which might make the plan longer.

So, I'll stick with the plan to get to green_box_1 in room_2.

Let's also revisit the constraint: "Before I am in room_2, either red_box_1 is in room_4 or I am holding some object."

To move red_box_1 to room_4:
1. I'd need to go from room_1 to room_3 to room_4 to room_2 to pick up red_box_1.
2. Then, I'd go back to room_4, drop red_box_1, and then go back to room_2 to get to green_box_1.

This seems longer than just picking up an object on the way (e.g., purple_box_1 in room_3).

So, the plan I outlined previously seems optimal for the given constraints and goal. Perhaps there are other optimizations that could be made if I'm missing something, but based on my understanding, the plan outlined is compact and efficient:

1. `gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_3`
2. `toggle grey_door_1`
3. `gotoroom room_1 room_3 grey_door_1`
4. `gotoobject purple_box_1 room_3`
5. `pick purple_box_1 room_3`
6. `gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_4`
7. `toggle blue_door_1`
8. `gotoroom room_3 room_4 blue_door_1`
9. `gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2`
10. `toggle red_door_1`
11. `gotoroom room_4 room_2 red_door_1`
12. `gotoempty`
13. `drop purple_box_1 room_2`
14. `gotoobject green_box_1 room_2`

Let me re-review to ensure I haven't missed anything:

The goal is to be in front of a green box. There are two green boxes: green_box_1 in room_2 and green_box_2 in room_4.

**Route to green_box_1 in room_2:**
1. Go from room_1 to room_3 (using grey_door_1).
2. Go from room_3 to room_4 (using blue_door_1).
3. Go from room_4 to room_2 (using red_door_1).
4. Go to green_box_1 in room_2.

**Route to green_box_2 in room_4:**
1. Go from room_1 to room_3 (using grey_door_1).
2. Go from room_3 to room_4 (using blue_door_1).
3. Go to green_box_2 in room_4.

Constraint 3 requires me to be in room_2 at some point. The route to green_box_1 naturally satisfies this. For the route to green_box_2, I'd need an additional visit to room_2.

Constraint 4 requires that before I enter room_2, either red_box_1 should be in room_4 or I should be holding some object. For the route to green_box_1, I can pick up purple_box_1 in room_3 to satisfy this. For the route to green_box_2, this is also relevant if I decide to visit room_2 to satisfy constraint 3.

Constraint 2 is that at some point, either purple_box_1 should be in room_2 or I should be holding some object. By picking up purple_box_1 and dropping it in room_2, I satisfy this.

Given the above, the route to green_box_1 seems more efficient for satisfying all constraints and achieving the goal.

I think the plan I've outlined is optimal. Let me make sure it's correctly formatted:

```
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_3
toggle grey_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_3 grey_door_1
gotoobject purple_box_1 room_3
pick purple_box_1 room_3
gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_4
toggle blue_door_1
gotoroom room_3 room_4 blue_door_1
gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2
toggle red_door_1
gotoroom room_4 room_2 red_door_1
gotoempty
drop purple_box_1 room_2
gotoobject green_box_1 room_2
```
