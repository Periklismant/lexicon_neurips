Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. Hmm, the goal is to end up in front of a red door that's unlocked. The red door in the initial state is locked, so I need to unlock it. But there are several constraints to satisfy. Let me break it down.

First, the final goal requires a red door (d) that's not locked, and I'm in front of it. The red doors here are red_door_1. So I need to be in front of red_door_1 and have it unlocked. But red_door_1 connects room_2 and room_4. Initially, I'm in room_4. But red_door_1 is locked. So I need to unlock it. But to toggle a door, I have to be in front of it. So I need to get to red_door_1, but since it's locked, maybe I need to go through another door first? Wait, the actions to go through a door require it to be unlocked. So how can I get to room_2 from room_4 if red_door_1 is locked?

Looking at the connections: room_4 is connected to room_2 via red_door_1 and to room_3 via grey_door_1. All doors are locked initially. So maybe I need to unlock some doors first. But to unlock a door, I need to be in front of it, which requires being in one of the rooms it connects. Since I'm in room_4, the doors connected here are red_door_1 (to room_2) and grey_door_1 (to room_3). Both are locked. So how can I get to another room? Wait, maybe there's another path. Let's see.

Wait, the initial rooms connected: room_1 is connected to room_2 via yellow_door_1, and to room_3 via blue_door_1. Room_2 is connected to room_4 via red_door_1, and room_3 is connected to room_4 via grey_door_1. All doors are locked. So starting in room_4, I can't go directly to room_2 or room_3 because their doors are locked. But maybe I can unlock one of these doors from room_4?

Wait, to toggle a door, I need to be in front of it. To get in front of a door, I need to be in a room connected by that door. So if I'm in room_4, I can go to grey_door_1 (which connects to room_3) or red_door_1 (connects to room_2). But both are locked. Wait, the preconditions for gotodoor are: (i) you are in a room connected by d, and (ii) no object is blocking the position in front of d. Are there any objects blocking doors in room_4? Let's check the initial state. In room_4, there's green_box_1, blue_box_1, red_ball_2. The doors are red_door_1 and grey_door_1. Are any of these objects blocking the doors? The problem description says that objects can block doors. But the initial state doesn't mention any blocking. Wait, the effect of picking up an object mentions that if x was blocking a door, then it's no longer blocking. But in the initial state, are any objects blocking doors? The problem doesn't state that, so perhaps none are blocking. So I can assume that the doors in room_4 are not blocked. So I can go to the doors in room_4.

So first, from room_4, I can go to red_door_1. Action: gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2. Then toggle it. But it's locked, so toggling will unlock it. Wait, but the action "toggle" unlocks if it's locked. So after toggle, red_door_1 becomes unlocked. Then I can go through it to room_2. But wait, the constraints say that red_door_1 must be locked in at least one state. Since initially it's locked, that's covered. Also, if red_door_1 is ever locked, then grey_door_1 must be unlocked in that state or after. Wait, the constraint says: if red_door_1 is locked in some state s, then grey_door_1 must be not locked in s or after. Initially, grey_door_1 is locked, so if I ever lock red_door_1 again after unlocking it, then I need to make sure grey_door_1 is unlocked either then or later. But the initial state already has red_door_1 locked, so the first constraint is satisfied. But we also need to have red_door_1 not locked in some state. So after unlocking it, that's covered. Then the plan can end with red_door_1 unlocked. But the constraints also require that if red_door_1 is not locked in some state, then there must be an earlier state where grey_ball_1 is in room_2. Grey_ball_1 is initially in room_1. So I need to move grey_ball_1 to room_2 before unlocking red_door_1. How?

Also, another constraint: if I'm in front of red_door_1 in some state, there must be a prior state where I was in front of blue_door_1. So before I get to red_door_1, I need to have been in front of blue_door_1. Blue_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3. But I'm starting in room_4. How can I get to blue_door_1? That requires moving through room_3 and room_1? Let's see.

But all doors are locked. So to get to room_3 from room_4, I need to unlock grey_door_1. But grey_door_1 is locked. So maybe first, go to grey_door_1 in room_4, toggle it (unlock), then go to room_3. Then from room_3, go to blue_door_1 (which connects to room_1), but blue_door_1 is locked. So I need to unlock it. But how to get to room_3 first. Let's outline:

1. Start in room_4.
2. Go to grey_door_1 (gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3)
3. Toggle grey_door_1 to unlock it.
4. Gotoroom room_4 to room_3 via grey_door_1. Now in room_3.
5. Now, to get to blue_door_1 (connecting room_1 and room_3), which is locked. So go to blue_door_1 in room_3 (gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_1)
6. Toggle blue_door_1 to unlock it.
7. Gotoroom room_3 to room_1 via blue_door_1. Now in room_1.
8. In room_1, there's purple_ball_1, grey_ball_1, and purple_ball_2. Need to move grey_ball_1 to room_2. So pick it up and carry it to room_2. But how to get to room_2 from room_1? Yellow_door_1 connects room_1 and room_2, but it's locked. So need to unlock yellow_door_1. But yellow_door_1 is in room_1. So:

9. In room_1, go to yellow_door_1 (gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2)
10. Toggle yellow_door_1 to unlock it.
11. Gotoroom room_1 to room_2 via yellow_door_1. Now in room_2.
12. Drop grey_ball_1 here. So first pick it up in room_1, then carry to room_2 and drop. Wait, but to pick up grey_ball_1, need to be in front of it. So steps after arriving in room_1:

8a. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_1
8b. pick grey_ball_1 room_1
9. Then go to yellow_door_1 (unlock as above)
10. Gotoroom to room_2, then drop grey_ball_1 there.

So after dropping grey_ball_1 in room_2, the constraint that grey_ball_1 is in room_2 is satisfied. Then later when red_door_1 is unlocked, that condition is met.

But how do we get to red_door_1? After getting to room_2, red_door_1 connects room_2 to room_4. But red_door_1 is initially locked. So need to unlock it. But to unlock red_door_1, need to be in front of it. If I'm in room_2, I can go to red_door_1 (gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_4), then toggle it. But before that, the constraint says that if I'm in front of red_door_1, I must have been in front of blue_door_1 earlier. So when I go to blue_door_1 in room_3 (step 5), that satisfies the condition.

So putting this together:

Plan steps:

1. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3
2. toggle grey_door_1
3. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1
4. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_1
5. toggle blue_door_1
6. gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_1
7. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_1
8. pick grey_ball_1 room_1
9. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2
10. toggle yellow_door_1
11. gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1
12. drop grey_ball_1 room_2
13. gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_4
14. toggle red_door_1 (unlock it)
15. Now, need to be in front of red_door_1, which we are after step 13. Wait, after step 13, we are in front of red_door_1. Then step 14 toggles it to unlock. Then the final state is that red_door_1 is unlocked, and we're in front of it. So that meets the goal.

But wait, after step 14, the door is unlocked. The goal requires that the door is not locked and we're in front of it. So step 14 is toggle to unlock, then after that, we are still in front of red_door_1. Wait, but the toggle action's effect is to unlock it. So after step 14, red_door_1 is unlocked, and we are in front of it. So that satisfies the goal. So steps 13 and 14 would be the last steps. Then the plan would end there.

But let's check the constraints:

- "red_door_1 is locked" must hold in at least one state. Initially, it is locked. So that's covered.

- If red_door_1 is locked in any state, then grey_door_1 must be not locked in that state or after. Initially, red_door_1 is locked, and grey_door_1 is locked. So after unlocking grey_door_1 in step 2, grey_door_1 is unlocked. So any state where red_door_1 is locked (initially and before step 14) would have grey_door_1 unlocked in later steps. For example, after step 2, grey_door_1 is unlocked, so any state after that where red_door_1 is locked (before step 14) would satisfy the constraint because grey_door_1 is unlocked. Also, when we toggle red_door_1 in step 14, it becomes unlocked, so after that, it's not locked. So the constraint is satisfied.

- "red_door_1 is not locked" must hold in at least one state. That's true after step 14.

- If red_door_1 is not locked in some state, then there must be an earlier state where grey_ball_1 is in room_2. After step 12, grey_ball_1 is dropped in room_2, so that's covered.

- "you are in front of red_door_1" must hold in at least one state. Step 13 puts us in front of red_door_1.

- If you are in front of red_door_1, there must be an earlier state where you were in front of blue_door_1. We were in front of blue_door_1 in step 4. So that's covered.

Now, the plan steps as outlined:

But let's check movement:

Start in room_4. Gotodoor grey_door_1 (room4 to room3). Toggle to unlock. Then go to room3. Then in room3, goto blue_door_1 (room3 to room1). Toggle to unlock. Go to room1. Then goto grey_ball_1, pick it. Then goto yellow_door_1 (room1 to room2), toggle to unlock. Go to room2. Drop grey_ball_1. Then goto red_door_1 (room2 to room4), toggle to unlock. Now in front of red_door_1, which is unlocked. So the final state meets the goal. Also, all constraints are satisfied.

But let's check the steps for preconditions:

After step 3, in room3. Then step4: gotodoor blue_door_1 room3 room1. Yes, blue_door_1 connects room3 and room1. Then toggle. Then step6: gotoroom room3 to room1 via blue_door_1, which is now unlocked. Correct.

In room1, step7: gotoobject grey_ball_1. Then pick. Then step9: gotodoor yellow_door_1, which is locked. Toggle to unlock. Then go to room2. Drop there. Then in room2, step13: gotodoor red_door_1. Toggle to unlock (it was locked initially, now unlocked). So now, in front of red_door_1, which is unlocked. That's the goal.

But wait, when you drop the grey_ball_1 in room2, you need to be in front of an empty position. Because the drop action requires the position in front to be empty. So after dropping, you are in front of the object. But how do you get to the door after that?

Wait, after step 11: gotoroom room1 to room2. After arriving in room2, you are no longer in front of any object. So to drop the grey_ball_1, you need to be in front of an empty spot. So after arriving in room2, you have to go to an empty position (gotoempty), then drop. Wait, but the 'drop' action requires that the position in front of you is empty. Wait, the 'drop' action's effect is that you are in front of the object you dropped. So when you drop, you must be in a position where you can drop it. Hmm. Let me think.

The 'drop' action's preconditions: (i) you are holding x, (ii) the position in front is empty. So after arriving in room2 via gotoroom, you are not in front of anything. So to drop, you need to be in front of an empty spot. So after arriving in room2, you need to gotoempty, then drop. So steps after arriving in room2:

11. gotoroom room1 room2 yellow_door_1 (now in room2, not in front of anything)
12. gotoempty (now in front of empty)
13. drop grey_ball_1 room2 (since you are in front of empty, you can drop here)

Wait, but the 'drop' action's effect is that you are in front of x after dropping. So after dropping, you are in front of grey_ball_1. So then you need to move to the door.

So after step 13 (drop), you are in front of grey_ball_1. Then you need to go to red_door_1. So:

14. gotodoor red_door_1 room2 room4 (precondition: in room2, which is connected via red_door_1. Also, no object blocking. Assuming no objects are blocking, which they aren't as per initial state)
15. toggle red_door_1 (now unlocked)
Now, you are in front of red_door_1, which is unlocked. That's the goal.

So inserting the gotoempty and drop steps:

So the revised steps would be:

1. gotodoor grey_door_1 room4 room3
2. toggle grey_door_1
3. gotoroom room4 room3 grey_door_1
4. gotodoor blue_door_1 room3 room1
5. toggle blue_door_1
6. gotoroom room3 room1 blue_door_1
7. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room1
8. pick grey_ball_1 room1
9. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room1 room2
10. toggle yellow_door_1
11. gotoroom room1 room2 yellow_door_1
12. gotoempty
13. drop grey_ball_1 room2
14. gotodoor red_door_1 room2 room4
15. toggle red_door_1

This way, after step 15, the door is unlocked, and you are in front of it. So the goal is achieved.

Checking constraints again:

- The first time red_door_1 is locked is the initial state. Then after step 15, it's unlocked. The constraint that red_door_1 must be locked in at least one state is satisfied by the initial state.

- The constraint that if red_door_1 is locked in a state, then grey_door_1 must be unlocked in that state or after. Initially, grey_door_1 is locked. After step 2, grey_door_1 is unlocked. So any state where red_door_1 is locked (before step 15) will have grey_door_1 unlocked in later states, satisfying the constraint.

- red_door_1 is not locked after step 15, satisfying the third constraint.

- The fourth constraint: if red_door_1 is not locked (after step15), then there must be a prior state where grey_ball_1 is in room2. After step13, grey_ball_1 is in room2, which is before step15.

- The fifth constraint: being in front of red_door_1 at step14-15. The sixth constraint: before being in front of red_door_1 (step14), you were in front of blue_door_1 at step4.

All constraints are satisfied.

Now, checking the plan's length. Is there a shorter way? For example, can we avoid going through room3 and room1? Let's see.

Alternative approach: From room4, can we unlock red_door_1 directly? But initially, red_door_1 is in room4 connected to room2. So in room4, can we goto red_door_1, toggle it (unlock), and then be in front of it. But then, according to the constraint, before being in front of red_door_1, we must have been in front of blue_door_1. So unless we go to blue_door_1 first, this approach wouldn't satisfy the constraint. So we need to go to blue_door_1 first.

So the plan as outlined is necessary. Let's count the steps: 15 actions. But maybe some steps can be optimized. For example, after dropping the ball, do we need to gotoempty? Wait, when you drop, you can drop in front of you, but you need to be in front of an empty spot. After arriving in room2 via gotoroom, you are not in front of anything. So to drop, you need to be in front of an empty spot. Hence, gotoempty is necessary before drop. So steps 12 and 13 are necessary.

Alternatively, maybe after arriving in room2, you can gotoobject red_ball_1 (which is in room2). Then pick it up, but that's not necessary. But in the initial state, red_ball_1 is in room2. But we don't need to pick it up. So the gotoempty is needed.

Alternatively, after arriving in room2, maybe you can goto the yellow_door_1 again, but that's not helpful. So the steps seem necessary.

Thus, the plan as outlined is valid and optimal, as it's the minimal steps needed to satisfy all constraints.
