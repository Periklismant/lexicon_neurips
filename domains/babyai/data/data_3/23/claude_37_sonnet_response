Let me analyze the planning problem and the constraints:

1. Initial State:
   - We start in room_4.
   - Various objects are distributed across rooms.
   - All doors (including red_door_1) are locked.
   - We have not visited any room except room_4.

2. Goal State:
   - We need to be in front of an unlocked red door.
   - Since there's only one red door (red_door_1), we need to be in front of red_door_1 and it must be unlocked.

3. Constraints:
   a. There must be a state where red_door_1 is locked (this is initially true).
   b. After red_door_1 is locked, grey_door_1 must be unlocked at that state or later.
   c. There must be a state where red_door_1 is unlocked.
   d. Before red_door_1 can be unlocked, grey_ball_1 must be in room_2.
   e. There must be a state where we are in front of red_door_1.
   f. Before we can be in front of red_door_1, we must be in front of blue_door_1.

The door connections are:
- room_1 and room_2 via yellow_door_1
- room_1 and room_3 via blue_door_1
- room_2 and room_4 via red_door_1 (this is the door we need to unlock)
- room_3 and room_4 via grey_door_1

Given the constraints, here's my plan:

1. We need to unlock the grey_door_1 first (due to constraint b).
2. Then, we need to move grey_ball_1 from room_1 to room_2 (due to constraint d).
3. After that, we need to be in front of blue_door_1 (due to constraint f).
4. Finally, we need to be in front of red_door_1 and unlock it (to achieve the goal).

Starting from room_4:

1. Go to and unlock grey_door_1 to get to room_3.
2. Go to and unlock blue_door_1 to get to room_1.
3. Move grey_ball_1 from room_1 to room_2 (via yellow_door_1).
4. Go back to room_4.
5. Go to room_2 (via red_door_1).
6. Go to and unlock red_door_1.
7. Be in front of red_door_1 with it unlocked (goal achieved).

Let's trace through the steps in detail:

Starting state:
- We are in room_4.
- All doors are locked.
- grey_ball_1 is in room_1.

Step 7: Go to grey_ball_1.
Action: "gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_1"
New state:
- We are in room_1, in front of grey_ball_1.
- grey_door_1 and blue_door_1 are unlocked.
- Other doors are locked.

Step 8: Pick up grey_ball_1.
Action: "pick grey_ball_1 room_1"
New state:
- We are in room_1, not in front of anything.
- We are holding grey_ball_1.
- grey_door_1 and blue_door_1 are unlocked.
- Other doors are locked.

Step 9: Go to yellow_door_1.
Action: "gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2"
New state:
- We are in room_1, in front of yellow_door_1.
- We are holding grey_ball_1.
- grey_door_1 and blue_door_1 are unlocked.
- Other doors are locked.

Step 10: Unlock yellow_door_1.
Action: "toggle yellow_door_1"
New state:
- We are in room_1, in front of yellow_door_1.
- We are holding grey_ball_1.
- grey_door_1, blue_door_1, and yellow_door_1 are unlocked.
- red_door_1 is locked.

Step 11: Go to room_2.
Action: "gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1"
New state:
- We are in room_2.
- We are holding grey_ball_1.
- grey_door_1, blue_door_1, and yellow_door_1 are unlocked.
- red_door_1 is locked.

Step 12: Go to an empty position in room_2.
Action: "gotoempty"
New state:
- We are in room_2, in front of an empty position.
- We are holding grey_ball_1.
- grey_door_1, blue_door_1, and yellow_door_1 are unlocked.
- red_door_1 is locked.

Step 13: Drop grey_ball_1.
Action: "drop grey_ball_1 room_2"
New state:
- We are in room_2, in front of grey_ball_1.
- grey_ball_1 is in room_2 (satisfying constraint d).
- grey_door_1, blue_door_1, and yellow_door_1 are unlocked.
- red_door_1 is locked.

Step 14: Go to red_door_1.
Action: "gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_4"
New state:
- We are in room_2, in front of red_door_1.
- grey_ball_1 is in room_2.
- grey_door_1, blue_door_1, and yellow_door_1 are unlocked.
- red_door_1 is locked.

Step 15: Unlock red_door_1.
Action: "toggle red_door_1"
New state:
- We are in room_2, in front of red_door_1.
- grey_ball_1 is in room_2.
- All doors are unlocked.

This satisfies all the constraints:
a. There was a state where red_door_1 was locked (the initial state and up to Step 14).
b. After red_door_1 was locked, grey_door_1 was unlocked (from Step 2 onwards).
c. There is a state where red_door_1 is unlocked (after Step 15).
d. Before red_door_1 was unlocked, grey_ball_1 was in room_2 (Step 13).
e. There is a state where we are in front of red_door_1 (Step 14 onwards).
f. Before we were in front of red_door_1, we were in front of blue_door_1 (Step 4-5).

And we've achieved the goal: We are in front of an unlocked red door (red_door_1).

Actually, let me go through it again to ensure I didn't miss anything:

Constraint (a): The expression "red_door_1 is locked" must hold in at least one state.
- This is satisfied as red_door_1 is initially locked and remains locked until Step 15.

Constraint (b): After "red_door_1 is locked", "grey_door_1 is not locked" must hold at the same state or later.
- After Step 2, grey_door_1 is unlocked while red_door_1 remains locked. So this is satisfied.

Constraint (c): The expression "red_door_1 is not locked" must hold in at least one state.
- This is satisfied after Step 15 when we unlock red_door_1.

Constraint (d): Before "red_door_1 is not locked", "grey_ball_1 is in room_2" must be true.
- We drop grey_ball_1 in room_2 at Step 13, and then unlock red_door_1 at Step 15. So this is satisfied.

Constraint (e): The expression "you are in front of red_door_1" must hold in at least one state.
- This is satisfied after Step 14 when we go to red_door_1.

Constraint (f): Before "you are in front of red_door_1", "you are in front of blue_door_1" must be true.
- We are in front of blue_door_1 at Steps 4-5, and then in front of red_door_1 at Step 14. So this is satisfied.

Hmm, upon reflection, there's an issue: I need to be in front of blue_door_1 before being in front of red_door_1, but the way I've structured this plan, this only happens if we unlock blue_door_1 to get to room_1. However, I need to make sure I'm explicitly "in front of" blue_door_1, not just interacting with it to get to room_1.

So, let's revise the plan to ensure I meet this constraint:

Starting state:
- We are in room_4.
- All doors are locked.
- grey_ball_1 is in room_1.

Step 1: Go to grey_door_1.
Action: "gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3"
New state:
- We are in room_4, in front of grey_door_1.
- All doors are locked.

Step 2: Unlock grey_door_1.
Action: "toggle grey_door_1"
New state:
- We are in room_4, in front of grey_door_1.
- grey_door_1 is unlocked.
- Other doors are locked.

Step 3: Go to room_3.
Action: "gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1"
New state:
- We are in room_3.
- grey_door_1 is unlocked.
- Other doors are locked.

Step 4: Go to blue_door_1.
Action: "gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_1"
New state:
- We are in room_3, in front of blue_door_1.
- grey_door_1 is unlocked.
- Other doors are locked.

Wait, I'm confused about constraint (f).

The constraint says:
"If expression 'you are in front of red_door_1' holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: 'you are in front of blue_door_1'"

This seems to be saying that before I'm ever in front of red_door_1, I need to have been in front of blue_door_1 at some point. The above plan satisfies this, since I go to blue_door_1 (Step 4) before I go to red_door_1 (Step 14).

Step 5: Unlock blue_door_1.
Action: "toggle blue_door_1"
New state:
- We are in room_3, in front of blue_door_1.
- grey_door_1 and blue_door_1 are unlocked.
- Other doors are locked.

Step 6: Go to room_1.
Action: "gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_1"
New state:
- We are in room_1.
- grey_door_1 and blue_door_1 are unlocked.
- Other doors are locked.

Step 7: Go to grey_ball_1.
Action: "gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_1"
New state:
- We are in room_1, in front of grey_ball_1.
- grey_door_1 and blue_door_1 are unlocked.
- Other doors are locked.

Step 8: Pick up grey_ball_1.
Action: "pick grey_ball_1 room_1"
New state:
- We are in room_1, not in front of anything.
- We are holding grey_ball_1.
- grey_door_1 and blue_door_1 are unlocked.
- Other doors are locked.

Step 9: Go to yellow_door_1.
Action: "gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2"
New state:
- We are in room_1, in front of yellow_door_1.
- We are holding grey_ball_1.
- grey_door_1 and blue_door_1 are unlocked.
- Other doors are locked.

Step 10: Unlock yellow_door_1.
Action: "toggle yellow_door_1"
New state:
- We are in room_1, in front of yellow_door_1.
- We are holding grey_ball_1.
- grey_door_1, blue_door_1, and yellow_door_1 are unlocked.
- red_door_1 is locked.

Step 11: Go to room_2.
Action: "gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1"
New state:
- We are in room_2.
- We are holding grey_ball_1.
- grey_door_1, blue_door_1, and yellow_door_1 are unlocked.
- red_door_1 is locked.

Step 12: Drop grey_ball_1.
Action: "drop grey_ball_1 room_2"
New state:
- We are in room_2, in front of grey_ball_1.
- grey_ball_1 is in room_2 (satisfying constraint d).
- grey_door_1, blue_door_1, and yellow_door_1 are unlocked.
- red_door_1 is locked.

Step 13: Go to red_door_1.
Action: "gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_4"
New state:
- We are in room_2, in front of red_door_1.
- grey_ball_1 is in room_2.
- grey_door_1, blue_door_1, and yellow_door_1 are unlocked.
- red_door_1 is locked.

Step 14: Unlock red_door_1.
Action: "toggle red_door_1"
New state:
- We are in room_2, in front of red_door_1.
- grey_ball_1 is in room_2.
- All doors are unlocked.

This satisfies all the constraints:
a. There was a state where red_door_1 was locked (the initial state and up to Step 13).
b. After red_door_1 was locked, grey_door_1 was unlocked (from Step 2 onwards).
c. There is a state where red_door_1 is unlocked (after Step 14).
d. Before red_door_1 was unlocked, grey_ball_1 was in room_2 (Step 12).
e. There is a state where we are in front of red_door_1 (Step 13 onwards).
f. Before we were in front of red_door_1, we were in front of blue_door_1 (Step 4).

Actually, I notice that step 12 is a little different from what I had previously. Let me correct that:

Step 12: Go to an empty position in room_2.
Action: "gotoempty"
New state:
- We are in room_2, in front of an empty position.
- We are holding grey_ball_1.
- grey_door_1, blue_door_1, and yellow_door_1 are unlocked.
- red_door_1 is locked.

Step 13: Drop grey_ball_1.
Action: "drop grey_ball_1 room_2"
New state:
- We are in room_2, in front of grey_ball_1.
- grey_ball_1 is in room_2 (satisfying constraint d).
- grey_door_1, blue_door_1, and yellow_door_1 are unlocked.
- red_door_1 is locked.

Step 14: Go to red_door_1.
Action: "gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_4"
New state:
- We are in room_2, in front of red_door_1.
- grey_ball_1 is in room_2.
- grey_door_1, blue_door_1, and yellow_door_1 are unlocked.
- red_door_1 is locked.

Step 15: Unlock red_door_1.
Action: "toggle red_door_1"
New state:
- We are in room_2, in front of red_door_1.
- grey_ball_1 is in room_2.
- All doors are unlocked.

I think now my plan is correct. Let's list all the actions in sequence:

1. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3
2. toggle grey_door_1
3. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1
4. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_1
5. toggle blue_door_1
6. gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_1
7. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_1
8. pick grey_ball_1 room_1
9. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2
10. toggle yellow_door_1
11. gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1
12. gotoempty
13. drop grey_ball_1 room_2
14. gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_4
15. toggle red_door_1

This plan satisfies all the constraints and the goal.

But wait, there's a mistake in step 14, when I say "gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_4" it implies going in front of red_door_1 from room_2. Since red_door_1 connects room_2 and room_4, the correct syntax is:

14. gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_4

Hmm, actually my original step 14 was correct. Let me double-check the other steps:

1. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3 (this is correct)
4. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_1 (this is correct)
9. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2 (this is correct)
14. gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_4 (this is correct)

Great, these all look correct, and all the steps look correct. Let me list the final plan to ensure its correctness:

1. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3
2. toggle grey_door_1
3. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1
4. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_1
5. toggle blue_door_1
6. gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_1
7. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_1
8. pick grey_ball_1 room_1
9. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2
10. toggle yellow_door_1
11. gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1
12. gotoempty
13. drop grey_ball_1 room_2
14. gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_4
15. toggle red_door_1

And this plan brings us to a state where:
- We are in front of red_door_1 (which is unlocked), satisfying the goal.
- We have satisfied all the constraints.

But one more time to make sure I'm not missing anything with the constraints:

Constraint (a): "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'red_door_1 is locked'"
- This is satisfied in the initial state and up to Step 14.

Constraint (b): "If expression 'red_door_1 is locked' holds in some state s, then expression 'grey_door_1 is not locked' must hold at s or at some state after s"
- After Step 2, grey_door_1 is unlocked while red_door_1 remains locked. So this is satisfied.

Constraint (c): "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'red_door_1 is not locked'"
- This is satisfied after Step 15.

Constraint (d): "If expression 'red_door_1 is not locked' holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: 'grey_ball_1 is in room_2'"
- We drop grey_ball_1 in room_2 at Step 13, and then unlock red_door_1 at Step 15. So this is satisfied.

Constraint (e): "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'you are in front of red_door_1'"
- This is satisfied after Step 14.

Constraint (f): "If expression 'you are in front of red_door_1' holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: 'you are in front of blue_door_1'"
- We are in front of blue_door_1 at Step 4, and then in front of red_door_1 at Step 14. So this is satisfied.

All constraints are satisfied, and our plan is correct.

Final Plan:
1. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3
2. toggle grey_door_1
3. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1
4. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_1
5. toggle blue_door_1
6. gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_1
7. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_1
8. pick grey_ball_1 room_1
9. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2
10. toggle yellow_door_1
11. gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1
12. gotoempty
13. drop grey_ball_1 room_2
14. gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_4
15. toggle red_door_1
