Okay, let's analyze the problem and constraints to come up with a valid plan. 

First, let's break down the goal: "There is a door d such that 'The following conditions are all true: d is green', 'you are in front of d', 'd is not locked'"

This means we need to find a door d that is green, go in front of it, and ensure that it's unlocked. From the world objects, I see "door green_door_1" which is green. So our goal is to be in front of green_door_1 and have it unlocked.

Now, let's look at the constraints:

1. At some point, yellow_door_2 must be locked. This is initially the case, so we just need to make sure we don't unlock yellow_door_2 without satisfying the second constraint.

2. If yellow_door_2 is locked, then either yellow_door_1 must be unlocked or yellow_box_1 must be in room_2. Initially, yellow_door_2 is locked, but yellow_door_1 is also locked and yellow_box_1 is in room_3. So we need to either unlock yellow_door_1 or move yellow_box_1 to room_2 before or while yellow_door_2 is locked.

3. At some point, we must be in front of purple_ball_1, which is initially in room_1.

4. At some point, green_door_1 must be unlocked. This is part of our goal.

5. If green_door_1 is unlocked, we must have been holding an object at some earlier state. So we need to pick up an object before unlocking green_door_1.

Let's start planning:

Initial state: We're in room_3.

To get to purple_ball_1, which is in room_1, we need to travel from room_3 to room_1. We can do this by going through the door grey_door_1, but it's locked, so we need to unlock it first.

To unlock green_door_1 (which is part of our goal), we must have held an object at some point. So let's plan to pick up an object.

Since we're in room_3, we can pick up blue_box_1, blue_ball_1, or yellow_box_1. Let's pick up yellow_box_1 as it could also help us satisfy the second constraint by moving it to room_2.

Before we unlock yellow_door_2, we must ensure that either yellow_door_1 is unlocked or yellow_box_1 is in room_2. Let's plan to move yellow_box_1 to room_2.

To do this, we need to go from room_3 to room_2. We can go from room_3 to room_1, then from room_1 to room_2. But first, we must unlock the doors grey_door_1 and yellow_door_1.

Let's summarize our initial plan:
1. Pick up yellow_box_1 from room_3.
2. Go to grey_door_1 (which connects room_3 and room_1).
3. Unlock grey_door_1.
4. Travel to room_1.
5. Go to yellow_door_1 (which connects room_1 and room_2).
6. Unlock yellow_door_1.
7. Travel to room_2.
8. Drop yellow_box_1 in room_2. Now yellow_box_1 is in room_2, satisfying constraint 2.
9. Go to green_door_1 (which connects room_2 and room_4).
10. Unlock green_door_1. Since we've held an object before (yellow_box_1), constraint 5 is satisfied.
11. Now, green_door_1 is unlocked and we're in front of it. This satisfies our goal and constraint 4.
12. Also, we'll need to go to purple_ball_1 at some point to satisfy constraint 3. We can do this when we're in room_1.

Now, let's make this more concrete, with the correct action format:

1. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_3
2. pick yellow_box_1 room_3
3. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1
4. toggle grey_door_1 (Now grey_door_1 is unlocked)
5. gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1
6. (find a way to locate purple_ball_1 to be in front of it) -- will need to use gotoobject
7. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_1 (now we're in front of purple_ball_1, satisfying constraint 3)
8. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2
9. toggle yellow_door_1 (Now yellow_door_1 is unlocked, which means we can satisfy constraint 2 even with yellow_door_2 locked)
10. gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1
11. gotoempty (to have an empty position in front of us where we can drop yellow_box_1)
12. drop yellow_box_1 room_2 (Now yellow_box_1 is in room_2, which also satisfies constraint 2)
13. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4
14. toggle green_door_1 (Now green_door_1 is unlocked, satisfying constraint 4. And since we've held yellow_box_1 before, constraint 5 is also satisfied)

Now, our goal is satisfied: We're in front of green_door_1, and green_door_1 is unlocked.

Wait, actually there's a simpler way. Let me see if we can directly achieve the goal without involving the yellow_box_1:

1. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_3 (or any other object in room_3)
2. pick blue_box_1 room_3
3. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1
4. toggle grey_door_1 (Now grey_door_1 is unlocked)
5. gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1
6. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_1 (we meet constraint 3 here)
7. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2
8. toggle yellow_door_1 (Now yellow_door_1 is unlocked, which means we can satisfy constraint 2 even with yellow_door_2 locked)
9. gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1
10. gotoempty (to have an empty position in front of us)
11. drop blue_box_1 room_2
12. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4
13. toggle green_door_1 (Now green_door_1 is unlocked)

Hmm, but I think there's still issues. Let's revisit the constraints:

1. At some point, yellow_door_2 must be locked. Initially it is locked, but we haven't yet explicitly stated that it remains locked during our plan. So, so far this constraint is satisfied.

2. If yellow_door_2 is locked, then either yellow_door_1 must be unlocked or yellow_box_1 must be in room_2. In our plan, we unlock yellow_door_1, which satisfies this constraint.

3. At some point, we must be in front of purple_ball_1, which is in room_1. In our plan, we go in front of purple_ball_1, which satisfies this constraint.

4. At some point, green_door_1 must be unlocked. In our plan, we unlock green_door_1, which satisfies this constraint.

5. If green_door_1 is unlocked, we must have been holding an object at some earlier state. In our plan, we hold blue_box_1 before unlocking green_door_1, which satisfies this constraint.

So, it seems like this plan satisfies all the constraints.

Let's sequence this a bit more precisely:

1. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_3
2. pick blue_box_1 room_3
3. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1
4. toggle grey_door_1
5. gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1
6. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_1 (satisfying constraint 3)
7. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2
8. toggle yellow_door_1 (Now yellow_door_1 is unlocked, which satisfies constraint 2 while yellow_door_2 is locked, which satisfies constraint 1)
9. gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1
10. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4
11. gotoempty
12. drop blue_box_1 room_2
13. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4
14. toggle green_door_1 (satisfying constraint 4, and constraint 5 is also satisfied because we held blue_box_1)

Now, the goal is satisfied because we're in front of green_door_1, and green_door_1 is unlocked.

Actually, I see a mistake. After dropping the object, I don't think we need to go to an empty position. I think we need to be in front of the door to toggle it. Let me correct the plan:

1. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_3
2. pick blue_box_1 room_3
3. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1
4. toggle grey_door_1
5. gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1
6. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_1 (satisfying constraint 3)
7. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2
8. toggle yellow_door_1 (Now yellow_door_1 is unlocked, which satisfies constraint 2 while yellow_door_2 is locked, which satisfies constraint 1)
9. gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1
10. gotoempty
11. drop blue_box_1 room_2
12. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4
13. toggle green_door_1 (satisfying constraint 4, and constraint 5 is also satisfied because we held blue_box_1)

Actually, let's just double-check the goal one more time: "There is a door d such that "The following conditions are all true: "d is green", "you are in front of d", "d is not locked"""

So we're in front of green_door_1, and green_door_1 is unlocked.

Actually, let's also quickly check if this plan follows the restrictions on the actions.

1. "gotoobject blue_box_1 room_3": We're in room_3, so we can go in front of blue_box_1. ✓
2. "pick blue_box_1 room_3": We're in the same room as blue_box_1 (room_3) and we're not holding any object. ✓
3. "gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1": We're in room_3, which is connected to room_1 via grey_door_1, and there's no object blocking the door. ✓
4. "toggle grey_door_1": We're in front of grey_door_1. ✓
5. "gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1": We're in room_3, which is adjacent to room_1, and the door grey_door_1 is now unlocked. ✓
6. "gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_1": We're in room_1, so we can go in front of purple_ball_1. ✓
7. "gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2": We're in room_1, which is connected to room_2 via yellow_door_1, and there's no object blocking the door. ✓
8. "toggle yellow_door_1": We're in front of yellow_door_1. ✓
9. "gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1": We're in room_1, which is adjacent to room_2, and the door yellow_door_1 is now unlocked. ✓
10. "gotoempty": We can go in front of an empty position anytime. ✓
11. "drop blue_box_1 room_2": We're holding blue_box_1 and the position in front of us is empty. ✓
12. "gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4": We're in room_2, which is connected to room_4 via green_door_1, and there's no object blocking the door. ✓
13. "toggle green_door_1": We're in front of green_door_1. ✓

This plan seems valid from the perspective of action restrictions as well. We've also satisfied all the given constraints, and we've achieved the goal. Let me send a finalized, succinct version:

1. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_3
2. pick blue_box_1 room_3
3. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1
4. toggle grey_door_1
5. gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1
6. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_1 (satisfying constraint 3)
7. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2
8. toggle yellow_door_1 (Now yellow_door_1 is unlocked, which satisfies constraint 2 while yellow_door_2 remains locked, satisfying constraint 1)
9. gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1
10. gotoempty
11. drop blue_box_1 room_2
12. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4
13. toggle green_door_1 (satisfying constraints 4 and 5, and achieving the goal as we're in front of green_door_1 and it's unlocked)
