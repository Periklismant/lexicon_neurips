Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. Hmm, the goal is to have a green door that's unlocked and be in front of it. The constraints are a bit tricky, so I need to make sure all of them are satisfied. Let's start by breaking down what's required.

First, the final goal: there exists a green door d where d is green, I'm in front of it, and it's unlocked. Looking at the doors, green_door_1 is green. So that's the target door. But it's initially locked. So I need to unlock it. To toggle a door, I need to be in front of it. But to get to green_door_1, which connects room_2 and room_4, I have to navigate there.

Starting in room_3. The doors from room_3 are grey_door_1 (to room_1) and yellow_door_2 (to room_4). Both are locked. So first, maybe I need to unlock one of these doors to move out of room_3. But wait, the constraints include that yellow_door_2 must be locked in at least one state, which it is initially. So that's already satisfied. But there's another constraint: if yellow_door_2 is locked in some state, then either yellow_door_1 is unlocked or yellow_box_1 is in room_2 at that state or later. Since yellow_door_2 starts locked, we need to ensure that either yellow_door_1 is unlocked at some point or yellow_box_1 is moved to room_2. But yellow_box_1 is in room_3 initially, so maybe moving it to room_2 would satisfy that.

Also, the plan must include a state where I'm in front of purple_ball_1, which is in room_1. So I need to go to room_1 and be in front of that ball. Additionally, green_door_1 must be unlocked at some point, and when that happens, I must have held an object before that. So unlocking green_door_1 requires me to have held something earlier.

Let's outline the steps:

1. Unlock the doors to move from room_3. The initial doors from room_3 are grey_door_1 (to room_1) and yellow_door_2 (to room_4). Both are locked. To unlock them, I need to toggle them, which requires being in front of them. But to get in front of them, I need to be in a room connected by the door and the position in front isn't blocked. Wait, the preconditions for "gotodoor" are that I'm in a room connected by the door and there's no object blocking the door's position. So in room_3, the doors are grey_door_1 (connecting room_3 and room_1) and yellow_door_2 (connecting room_3 and room_4). So to go to grey_door_1 from room_3, I can do "gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1" (since the door connects room_3 and room_1). But is there any object blocking the door in room_3? The initial state in room_3 has blue_box_1, blue_ball_1, and yellow_box_1. Are any of these blocking the doors? The problem description doesn't mention objects blocking doors initially. The initial state doesn't state that any objects are blocking doors. So maybe the doors are not blocked. So I can go to grey_door_1 in room_3, then toggle it to unlock. Then use gotoroom to go to room_1. Alternatively, maybe unlock yellow_door_2 first to go to room_4. Let's see.

But the goal is to get to green_door_1 (in room_2 and room_4), which is green. To reach green_door_1, perhaps I need to go through room_2 or room_4. Let's see the connections:

- room_3 connects to room_1 via grey_door_1 and to room_4 via yellow_door_2.
- room_1 connects to room_2 via yellow_door_1.
- room_2 connects to room_4 via green_door_1.
- room_4 connects to room_3 via yellow_door_2 and to room_2 via green_door_1.

So, to get to room_2, possible paths are from room_1 via yellow_door_1 or from room_4 via green_door_1. But initially, all doors are locked. So to unlock any door, I need to be in front of it. Let's think about the steps.

Starting in room_3. Let's try to unlock grey_door_1 first. So:

1. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1 (since I'm in room_3, and the door connects to room_1)
2. toggle grey_door_1 (unlocks it)
3. gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1 (now in room_1)
4. Now, in room_1, the purple_ball_1 is here. Need to be in front of it at some point. So:
   gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_1 (satisfies the constraint of being in front of purple_ball_1)
5. Then, maybe proceed to room_2 via yellow_door_1. But yellow_door_1 is locked. So need to unlock it. To do that, need to get to it. Since room_1 and room_2 are connected via yellow_door_1, from room_1:
   gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2
   toggle yellow_door_1 (unlocks it)
   Then go to room_2 via gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1
6. Now in room_2, which has yellow_ball_1. But the goal is to reach green_door_1. green_door_1 connects room_2 and room_4. So from room_2, need to unlock green_door_1. But to do that, need to be in front of it. So:
   gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4
   toggle green_door_1 (unlocks it)
   Now, green_door_1 is unlocked. But the constraint says that when green_door_1 is unlocked, I must have held an object before. So, before toggling green_door_1, I need to have held something. So maybe pick up yellow_ball_1 in room_2 before unlocking green_door_1.

Wait, but how to pick up an object? Let's see. I can pick up an object if I'm in the same room and not holding anything. So in room_2, there's yellow_ball_1. So:

After step 5 (in room_2):
7. gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2
8. pick yellow_ball_1 room_2
9. Now, holding yellow_ball_1. Then, go to green_door_1:
   gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4
10. toggle green_door_1 (unlock it)
    Now, the constraint is satisfied because I had held yellow_ball_1 before unlocking green_door_1.

Then, after unlocking green_door_1, I can go to room_4. But the goal is to be in front of a green door (green_door_1) that's unlocked. Since I just toggled it, I'm already in front of it. So maybe after step 10, that's the goal state. But wait, the goal requires that I'm in front of the green door (d) and it's unlocked. So after step 10, if I'm in front of green_door_1 and it's unlocked, that's the goal. But also, the constraints need to be checked.

Wait, let's check all constraints:

1. yellow_door_2 is locked in at least one state: Initially, it's locked. So that's covered.

2. If yellow_door_2 is locked in any state, then either yellow_door_1 is not locked or yellow_box_1 is in room_2 at that state or later. Since yellow_door_2 is initially locked, but in the plan, we may have toggled other doors. But if the plan doesn't lock yellow_door_2 again, then the initial state satisfies the first part, and we need to ensure that either yellow_door_1 is unlocked (which we do in step 5) or yellow_box_1 is in room_2. But yellow_box_1 is in room_3. So unless we move it, that condition isn't met. Wait, the constraint says that if yellow_door_2 is locked in some state s, then in s or some state after, either yellow_door_1 is unlocked or yellow_box_1 is in room_2. In our current plan, when do we have yellow_door_2 locked? Initially, it's locked. So in the initial state s0, the condition must hold. So at s0 or after, either yellow_door_1 is unlocked (which happens when we unlock it in step 5) or yellow_box_1 is in room_2. Since in the initial state, yellow_door_1 is locked, but later we unlock it. So in s0 (yellow_door_2 locked), after s0, we unlock yellow_door_1, which makes the condition hold. So that's okay. So this constraint is satisfied because after the initial state where yellow_door_2 is locked, we later unlock yellow_door_1, which satisfies the condition.

3. Must be in front of purple_ball_1 at some state. That's step 4.

4. green_door_1 must be unlocked in at least one state. That's step 10.

5. When green_door_1 is unlocked (step 10), there must have been a prior state where I held an object. That's step 8 (picked up yellow_ball_1).

So the plan so far would be:

1. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1
2. toggle grey_door_1
3. gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1
4. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_1
5. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2
6. toggle yellow_door_1
7. gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1
8. gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2
9. pick yellow_ball_1 room_2
10. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4
11. toggle green_door_1

At this point, I'm in front of green_door_1 (which is green) and it's unlocked. So the goal is achieved. The constraints are all satisfied.

But wait, after step 3, we are in room_1. Then step 4 is being in front of purple_ball_1. Then step 5: gotodoor yellow_door_1 in room_1. Then toggle it (unlock), then go to room_2. Then steps 8-11. That seems to work.

But let's check if the movement is possible.

After step 3, we are in room_1. Then step 4: gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_1 (possible since in same room). Then step 5: gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2 (since in room_1, the door connects to room_2). Then toggle it (unlock), then gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1.

Yes. Then in room_2, pick up yellow_ball_1, then go to green_door_1 in room_2, toggle it. Now, in front of green_door_1, which is green and unlocked. That's the goal.

But wait, the problem states that the final goal is that there exists a door d (green, in front of, unlocked). So after step 11, we are in front of green_door_1, which is now unlocked. So that's the goal state. So the plan ends here.

But let's check the constraints again:

- yellow_door_2 is locked in at least one state: yes, in the initial state, and we never toggled it, so it remains locked.

- The conditional constraint: when yellow_door_2 is locked (which is always except if we unlock it), then either yellow_door_1 is not locked (which we did unlock) or yellow_box_1 is in room_2. Since we unlocked yellow_door_1, that condition is satisfied.

- In front of purple_ball_1: step 4.

- green_door_1 is not locked: step 11.

- When green_door_1 is unlocked (step 11), prior state holding object: step 9.

So all constraints are satisfied. The plan is 11 steps. Is there a shorter plan?

Alternative approach: Could we go from room_3 to room_4 via yellow_door_2, unlock it, then proceed? But yellow_door_2 is locked initially, so need to unlock it. To do that, need to be in front of it. So in room_3:

gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_3 room_4

toggle yellow_door_2 (unlocks it)

gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_2

But then in room_4, which has green_door_1 connecting to room_2. But green_door_1 is locked. So need to unlock it. To do that, need to be in front of it. So from room_4:

gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2

toggle green_door_1 (unlocks it)

But then, need to be in front of green_door_1. However, the goal requires being in front of a green door (green_door_1) that's unlocked. So after unlocking it from room_4, would that satisfy being in front of it? Let's see.

If in room_4, after unlocking green_door_1, I'm in front of it. Then the goal is achieved. But also, need to have held an object before unlocking green_door_1. So pick up an object in room_4. Room_4 has green_box_1, blue_box_2, red_box_1. So pick up green_box_1:

gotoobject green_box_1 room_4

pick green_box_1 room_4

Then gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2

toggle green_door_1

But this approach might be shorter. Let's see the steps:

1. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_3 room_4
2. toggle yellow_door_2 (unlocks it)
3. gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_2
4. gotoobject green_box_1 room_4
5. pick green_box_1 room_4
6. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2
7. toggle green_door_1

Now, after step 7, I'm in front of green_door_1 (green) and it's unlocked. The goal is achieved. But what about the constraints?

- yellow_door_2 is locked in at least one state: yes, initially. Then step 2 unlocks it, so after that, it's unlocked. But the constraint requires that it's locked in at least one state, which is true in the initial state.

- The conditional constraint: when yellow_door_2 is locked (initial state), then either yellow_door_1 is unlocked or yellow_box_1 is in room_2. But in this plan, yellow_door_1 remains locked because we didn't touch it. So we need to have yellow_box_1 moved to room_2. But in this plan, yellow_box_1 is in room_3 and isn't moved. So this violates the constraint. Because after the initial state (where yellow_door_2 is locked), we need to ensure that at some point after, either yellow_door_1 is unlocked or yellow_box_1 is in room_2. In this plan, yellow_door_1 remains locked, and yellow_box_1 is still in room_3. So this plan would fail the constraint.

Therefore, the first approach is better because it unlocks yellow_door_1, satisfying the constraint.

So the initial plan is valid. Let's count the steps again:

1. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1
2. toggle grey_door_1 (unlocks)
3. gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1 (now in room_1)
4. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_1 (constraint met)
5. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2
6. toggle yellow_door_1 (unlocks)
7. gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1 (now in room_2)
8. gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2
9. pick yellow_ball_1 room_2 (now holding)
10. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4
11. toggle green_door_1 (unlocks)
    Now in front of green_door_1, which is green and unlocked. Goal achieved.

This plan meets all constraints. Let's check if any steps can be optimized. For example, after step 3, going to purple_ball_1 (step4), then to yellow_door_1 (step5). Is there a way to avoid moving back and forth? But I think it's necessary to first go to the door to unlock it.

Alternatively, maybe after step3, go directly to yellow_door_1, unlock it, then go to room_2, then to purple_ball_1 later. Wait, but the constraint requires being in front of purple_ball_1 at some state. If we go to room_2 and don't return to room_1, that would be a problem. So we have to go to room_1's purple_ball_1 before moving to room_2. Wait, no. The initial plan goes from room_3 to room_1 (step3), then in room_1, we go to purple_ball_1 (step4), then proceed to unlock yellow_door_1 and move to room_2. That's correct.

Alternatively, after step3 (in room_1), instead of going to purple_ball_1, go directly to yellow_door_1. But then when would we satisfy the constraint of being in front of purple_ball_1? We have to go back to room_1 later? No, because once in room_2, to get back to room_1, the door is already unlocked. But adding steps to return would make the plan longer. So the initial plan's step4 is necessary to satisfy the constraint.

Thus, the plan as outlined is valid and optimal. Let's write it out.
