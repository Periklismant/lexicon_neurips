Let me analyze the problem step by step.

We have a gridworld with 4 rooms. I am initially in room_2. The goal is to be in front of purple_door_1 when it's unlocked. purple_door_1 connects room_3 and room_4.

Key constraints:
1. At some point, I must be in front of blue_door_2.
2. Before being in front of blue_door_2, I must be holding red_ball_2.
3. blue_door_2 must remain locked throughout the plan.
4. At some point, I must be in room_4.
5. Before being in room_4, either green_box_1 must be in room_4 or I must be holding some object.

First, let's check where the objects are initially:
- red_ball_1, red_ball_2, and yellow_box_1 are in room_1
- yellow_ball_1 and grey_box_1 are in room_2 (where I am)
- purple_ball_1 and green_box_1 are in room_3
- blue_box_1 is in room_4

All doors start locked: red_door_1, blue_door_1, blue_door_2, and purple_door_1.

To work on a plan:

1. I need to go to room_1 to pick up red_ball_2, which means I need to unlock red_door_1.
2. I need to satisfy constraint 5 before entering room_4. I could either:
   a. Move green_box_1 from room_3 to room_4, or
   b. Be holding some object when entering room_4

3. To reach room_4 while blue_door_2 remains locked, I need to go through room_3 and then unlock purple_door_1.

Let me start drafting a plan:

1. I'm in room_2.
2. Go to red_door_1 (connects room_2 and room_1).
3. Unlock red_door_1.
4. Go to room_1.
5. Find and pick up red_ball_2.
6. Go back to room_2.
7. Go to blue_door_2 (to satisfy constraint 1 - I must be in front of blue_door_2 while holding red_ball_2).
8. Since I can't use blue_door_2 (must stay locked), I need to go back to room_1.
9. Go to blue_door_1 (connects room_1 and room_3).
10. Unlock blue_door_1.
11. Go to room_3.
12. Find green_box_1 in room_3.
13. Pick up green_box_1 (but I'm already holding red_ball_2, so I need to drop it first).
14. Go to purple_door_1 (connects room_3 and room_4).
15. Unlock purple_door_1.
16. Enter room_4 while holding green_box_1 (to satisfy constraint 5).
17. Now I need to return to room_3 and unlock purple_door_1 again (if needed).
18. Stand in front of purple_door_1 while it's unlocked (goal state).

But wait, I see an issue - I can't hold both red_ball_2 and green_box_1 at the same time. Let me rethink this.

Actually, for constraint 5, I can just be holding any object when entering room_4. So I can hold red_ball_2 when entering room_4.

Let's refine the plan:

1. I'm in room_2.
2. Go to red_door_1 (connects room_2 and room_1).
3. Unlock red_door_1.
4. Go to room_1.
5. Find and pick up red_ball_2.
6. Go back to room_2.
7. Go to blue_door_2 (to satisfy constraint 1 - I must be in front of blue_door_2 while holding red_ball_2).
8. Go back to room_1 (through red_door_1).
9. Go to blue_door_1 (connects room_1 and room_3).
10. Unlock blue_door_1.
11. Go to room_3.
12. Go to purple_door_1 (connects room_3 and room_4).
13. Unlock purple_door_1.
14. Enter room_4 while holding red_ball_2 (to satisfy constraint 5).
15. Return to room_3 (through purple_door_1).
16. Stand in front of purple_door_1 when it's unlocked (goal state).

Wait, I just realized that if I go from room_3 to room_4, I will no longer be in front of the door. I need to make sure I'm in front of purple_door_1 when it's unlocked for the goal state.

Let's refine again:

1. I'm in room_2.
2. Go to red_door_1 (connects room_2 and room_1).
3. Unlock red_door_1 (toggle red_door_1).
4. Go to room_1 (gotoroom room_2 room_1 red_door_1).
5. Find red_ball_2 (gotoobject red_ball_2 room_1).
6. Pick up red_ball_2 (pick red_ball_2 room_1).
7. Go back to room_2 (gotoroom room_1 room_2 red_door_1).
8. Go to blue_door_2 (gotodoor blue_door_2 room_2 room_4).
9. Return to room_1 (gotoroom room_2 room_1 red_door_1).
10. Go to blue_door_1 (gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_3).
11. Unlock blue_door_1 (toggle blue_door_1).
12. Go to room_3 (gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_1).
13. Go to purple_door_1 (gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_4).
14. Unlock purple_door_1 (toggle purple_door_1).
15. Enter room_4 while holding red_ball_2 (gotoroom room_3 room_4 purple_door_1).
16. Return to room_3 (gotoroom room_4 room_3 purple_door_1).
17. Go to purple_door_1 (gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_4).

Let me check if this plan satisfies all constraints:

1. ✅ At some point, I am in front of blue_door_2 (step 8).
2. ✅ Before being in front of blue_door_2, I am holding red_ball_2 (picked up in step 6).
3. ✅ blue_door_2 remains locked throughout the plan.
4. ✅ At some point, I am in room_4 (step 15).
5. ✅ Before entering room_4, I am holding red_ball_2.
6. ✅ The goal state is achieved: I'm in front of purple_door_1 (in room_3), and purple_door_1 is unlocked.

Let me check if the actions and their sequencing are valid according to the preconditions and effects:

1. I'm in room_2 (initial state)
2. gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_1: Valid, I can go to a door in my current room.
3. toggle red_door_1: Valid, I'm in front of the door.
4. gotoroom room_2 room_1 red_door_1: Valid, the door is now unlocked.
5. gotoobject red_ball_2 room_1: Valid, red_ball_2 is in room_1.
6. pick red_ball_2 room_1: Valid, I'm in front of it and my hands are empty.
7. gotoroom room_1 room_2 red_door_1: Valid, the door is unlocked.
8. gotodoor blue_door_2 room_2 room_4: Valid, I can go to a door in my current room.
9. gotoroom room_2 room_1 red_door_1: Valid, the door is unlocked.
10. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_3: Valid, I can go to a door in my current room.
11. toggle blue_door_1: Valid, I'm in front of the door.
12. gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_1: Valid, the door is now unlocked.
13. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_4: Valid, I can go to a door in my current room.
14. toggle purple_door_1: Valid, I'm in front of the door.
15. gotoroom room_3 room_4 purple_door_1: Valid, the door is now unlocked.
16. gotoroom room_4 room_3 purple_door_1: Valid, the door is unlocked.
17. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_4: Valid, I can go to a door in my current room.

The plan looks valid! But let me optimize it by checking if there are any redundant steps:

We go from room_3 to room_4 and back to room_3 just to satisfy the constraint that we need to be in room_4 at some point. I don't believe this can be optimized further without violating one of the constraints.

Let me provide the final plan with the appropriate action formats:

```
gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_1
toggle red_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_1 red_door_1
gotoobject red_ball_2 room_1
pick red_ball_2 room_1
gotoroom room_1 room_2 red_door_1
gotodoor blue_door_2 room_2 room_4
gotoroom room_2 room_1 red_door_1
gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_3
toggle blue_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_1
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_4
toggle purple_door_1
gotoroom room_3 room_4 purple_door_1
gotoroom room_4 room_3 purple_door_1
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_4
```

Actually, there's a small optimization I can make. After step 15, I don't need to return to room_3 and then go to the door - I could just go directly to the door from room_4, saving one step. Let me check if this works:

If I'm in room_4, I can go to the door purple_door_1 from that side (room_4 side), but the goal requires me to be in front of purple_door_1 from room_3. So I do need to return to room_3.

Let me provide the final plan with the appropriate action formats:

```
gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_1
toggle red_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_1 red_door_1
gotoobject red_ball_2 room_1
pick red_ball_2 room_1
gotoroom room_1 room_2 red_door_1
gotodoor blue_door_2 room_2 room_4
gotoroom room_2 room_1 red_door_1
gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_3
toggle blue_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_1
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_4
toggle purple_door_1
gotoroom room_3 room_4 purple_door_1
gotoroom room_4 room_3 purple_door_1
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_4
```

Wait, when I go to room_4 from room_3, I'm no longer in front of any door. So when I return to room_3, I need to go to the door purple_door_1 again. This is reflected in the final step of the plan.

Let's double-check all constraints:
1. ✅ I am in front of blue_door_2 at step 7.
2. ✅ Before being in front of blue_door_2, I am holding red_ball_2 (picked up in step 5).
3. ✅ blue_door_2 remains locked throughout the plan.
4. ✅ I am in room_4 at step 14.
5. ✅ Before entering room_4, I am holding red_ball_2.
6. ✅ The goal state is achieved at step 16: I'm in front of purple_door_1 (from room_3), and purple_door_1 is unlocked.

The plan is valid and optimized!

```
gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_1
toggle red_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_1 red_door_1
gotoobject red_ball_2 room_1
pick red_ball_2 room_1
gotoroom room_1 room_2 red_door_1
gotodoor blue_door_2 room_2 room_4
gotoroom room_2 room_1 red_door_1
gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_3
toggle blue_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_1
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_4
toggle purple_door_1
gotoroom room_3 room_4 purple_door_1
gotoroom room_4 room_3 purple_door_1
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_4
```

This plan consists of 16 steps and is optimal for achieving the goal while satisfying all constraints.

Actually, let me just make one more verification - the goal specifically says: 
"There is a door d such that "The following conditions are all true: "d is purple", "room_3 and room_4 are connected via d", "you are in front of d", "d is not locked"""

So I need to make sure that purple_door_1 is connecting room_3 and room_4, and that I'm in front of it from room_3, and that it's unlocked. This is achieved in the final step of the plan.

Finally, I need to verify I didn't miss any other constraints. One requirement is to be holding red_ball_2 before being in front of blue_door_2, which is satisfied. The other requirement is that before being in room_4, either green_box_1 is in room_4 or I'm holding some object. In my plan, I'm holding red_ball_2 when I enter room_4, so this constraint is also satisfied.

The plan is complete and optimal.
