Okay, let's tackle this planning problem step by step. The goal is to get to a purple door connecting room_3 and room_4 (which is purple_door_1), be in front of it, and have it unlocked. Also, there are several constraints to satisfy. Let's break down the problem.

First, the initial state: I'm in room_2. The purple door (purple_door_1) connects room_3 and room_4, and it's locked. To unlock it, I need to toggle it, which requires being in front of it. So, I need to get to room_3 or room_4, go to the purple door, and toggle it.

But there are constraints. Let's list them:

1. Must be in front of blue_door_2 at least once. But blue_door_2 is in room_2 and room_4. Since I start in room_2, maybe I can go there. However, blue_door_2 is locked. Wait, the constraint says blue_door_2 must remain locked in every state. So I can't unlock it. So to go through blue_door_2, it's impossible because it's locked. Wait, but the "goto room" action requires the door to be unlocked. So if blue_door_2 is always locked, I can't use it to go to room_4. Hmm.

But the constraint says "blue_door_2 is locked" must hold in every state. So even if I tried to toggle it, that's not allowed because toggling would change its state. So I can't toggle blue_door_2. Therefore, I can't use blue_door_2 to move between room_2 and room_4. So how else can I get to room_4?

Looking at the doors: room_1 connects to room_3 via blue_door_1 (locked), room_1 to room_2 via red_door_1 (locked), room_2 to room_4 via blue_door_2 (locked), and room_3 to room_4 via purple_door_1 (locked). All doors are initially locked. So to move between rooms, I need to unlock some doors. But which ones can I unlock?

The goal is to have purple_door_1 unlocked. So I need to get to that door and toggle it. To get to purple_door_1, I need to be in either room_3 or room_4. Let's see possible paths.

Starting in room_2, initial doors available: red_door_1 (connects to room_1, locked), blue_door_2 (connects to room_4, locked). Since both are locked, I can't move through them unless I unlock them. But red_door_1 is red. Are there any keys or objects that can unlock doors? Wait, the problem doesn't mention keys. The only way to unlock a door is to toggle it, which requires being in front of it. So to unlock a door, I need to be in front of it. But to get in front of a door that's in another room, I need to be in that room. Wait, no. For example, red_door_1 connects room_1 and room_2. So if I'm in room_2, can I go to red_door_1? The "goto door" action requires that I'm in a room connected by the door, and that there's no object blocking the position in front of the door. Are there any objects blocking doors?

Looking at initial state, the objects in room_1: red_ball_1, red_ball_2, yellow_box_1. In room_2: yellow_ball_1, grey_box_1. So maybe in room_2, the blue_door_2 is blocked by an object? The problem states that "goto door" requires no object blocking the position in front of d in the current room. Let's see: in room_2, the doors are red_door_1 (to room_1) and blue_door_2 (to room_4). Are there objects blocking their positions? The initial objects in room_2 are yellow_ball_1 and grey_box_1. If either of these is in front of a door, then "goto door" would be blocked. But the problem doesn't specify positions of objects relative to doors. Since the problem doesn't state that any objects are blocking doors, maybe we can assume they aren't. So perhaps I can go to the doors in the current room.

So, starting in room_2, I can try to goto red_door_1. But red_door_1 is locked. Wait, but to toggle a door, I need to be in front of it. So if I can get in front of red_door_1, I can toggle it to unlock. Let's try:

Action: gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_1. But wait, the gotodoor action is "gotodoor d r1 r2", but the preconditions say you must be in a room connected by d. Since I'm in room_2, which is connected to room_1 via red_door_1, so I can do gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_1. Then, toggle red_door_1. That would unlock it, allowing me to go to room_1.

But let's check constraints. The first constraint is that I must be in front of blue_door_2 in at least one state. Also, whenever I'm in front of blue_door_2, I must have held red_ball_2 earlier. So perhaps I need to first pick up red_ball_2, which is in room_1, then go to blue_door_2.

Wait, red_ball_2 is in room_1. So to pick it up, I need to be in room_1. To get to room_1 from room_2, I need to unlock red_door_1. So steps:

1. In room_2, goto red_door_1 (room_2 to room_1).
2. Toggle red_door_1 to unlock it.
3. Gotoroom room_2 room_1 red_door_1.
4. Now in room_1. Goto red_ball_2.
5. Pick red_ball_2.
6. Then, need to go to blue_door_2. But blue_door_2 is in room_2 and room_4. Wait, blue_door_2 connects room_2 and room_4. So to be in front of blue_door_2, I need to be in room_2 or room_4. If I'm in room_1, how do I get to room_2? Since red_door_1 is now unlocked. So from room_1, gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_2, then gotoroom room_1 room_2 red_door_1. Then in room_2 again. Then goto blue_door_2 (room_2 to room4). Then that satisfies the first constraint (being in front of blue_door_2), but since I'm holding red_ball_2, that satisfies the second constraint (if in front of blue_door_2, must have held red_ball_2 earlier). But after that, I need to get to room_4. But blue_door_2 is locked, and the constraint says it must always be locked. So I can't toggle it. Therefore, I can't go through blue_door_2 to room_4. So how else to get to room_4?

Alternative path: From room_1, unlock blue_door_1 (connecting room_1 and room_3). But blue_door_1 is locked. So:

After step 5 (holding red_ball_2), go to blue_door_1 in room_1. But to get to blue_door_1, need to be in room_1. So:

7. Goto blue_door_1 (room_1 to room3).
8. Toggle blue_door_1 to unlock.
9. Gotoroom room_1 room3 blue_door_1. Now in room3.

In room3, there's purple_door_1 connecting to room4. But purple_door_1 is locked. So:

10. Goto purple_door_1 in room3.
11. Toggle to unlock it.
12. Gotoroom room3 room4 purple_door_1. Now in room4, which satisfies the constraint of being in room4 at least once. Also, when entering room4, need to check if the condition for entering room4 was met: earlier state must have green_box_1 in room4 or holding something. Since I'm holding red_ball_2, that satisfies the condition.

Once in room4, the goal is to be in front of purple_door_1 (which connects room3 and room4). But I'm in room4, so I can goto purple_door_1 in room4. Then, ensure it's unlocked. Then, that would satisfy the goal.

But let's check the steps again, considering all constraints.

But let's outline the possible steps:

1. Start in room2.
2. gotodoor red_door_1 room2 room1. Now in front of red_door_1.
3. toggle red_door_1. Now unlocked.
4. gotoroom room2 room1 red_door_1. Now in room1.
5. gotoobject red_ball_2 room1.
6. pick red_ball_2 room1. Now holding it.
7. gotodoor red_door_1 room1 room2.
8. gotoroom room1 room2 red_door_1. Back to room2.
9. gotodoor blue_door_2 room2 room4. Now in front of blue_door_2. This satisfies the first constraint (must be in front of blue_door_2 at least once). Since we're holding red_ball_2 from step6, the second constraint is satisfied (if in front of blue_door_2, must have held red_ball_2 earlier). But blue_door_2 is locked and must stay locked. So we can't toggle it. So we can't go through it. So from room2, after step9, we can't proceed to room4 via blue_door_2. So how else to get to room4.

Alternative path after step6:

7. From room1, goto blue_door_1 (connecting to room3).
8. toggle blue_door_1 (unlocks it).
9. gotoroom room1 room3 blue_door_1. Now in room3.
10. In room3, there's purple_door_1 connecting to room4. Need to unlock it.
11. gotodoor purple_door_1 room3 room4.
12. toggle purple_door_1 (unlocks it).
13. gotoroom room3 room4 purple_door_1. Now in room4. Satisfies the constraint of being in room4. Also, when entering room4, the condition is that earlier state had either green_box_1 in room4 or holding something. We were holding red_ball_2, so that's satisfied.
14. Now in room4. Need to be in front of purple_door_1. So goto purple_door_1 from room4. But purple_door_1 is in room3 and room4. So in room4, gotodoor purple_door_1 room4 room3.
15. Now in front of purple_door_1. Check if it's unlocked (we toggled it in step12). So the goal is achieved: purple_door_1 is purple, connects room3 and room4, we're in front of it, and it's unlocked.

But also, the plan needs to satisfy that blue_door_2 is always locked. Since we never toggled it, it remains locked. Also, when we were in front of blue_door_2 in step9 (if that path is taken), but blue_door_2 is still locked. Wait, but in the alternative path above, after step6, we went back to room2 and then to blue_door_2. But maybe that's a longer path. Let me check the steps again.

Wait, in the first approach:

After step6 (holding red_ball_2 in room1), we go back to room2 via red_door_1 (steps7-8). Then goto blue_door_2 (step9). Then proceed to unlock blue_door_1? Wait, no. Because blue_door_1 connects room1 and room3. So after step8 (back in room2), we can't directly go to blue_door_1. Hmm. Maybe that's not the optimal path.

Alternative approach:

After unlocking red_door_1 and entering room1, pick red_ball_2, then go to blue_door_1 (in room1), unlock it, go to room3, then unlock purple_door_1, go to room4. That way, we don't need to go back to room2 and front of blue_door_2. But how do we satisfy the constraint of being in front of blue_door_2?

Wait, the first constraint says that "you are in front of blue_door_2" must hold in at least one state. So we need to have that action in the plan. So even if we don't use blue_door_2, we need to at least be in front of it once. But blue_door_2 is in room2 and room4. To be in front of it, you can be in either room. But we start in room2, which is connected to blue_door_2. So maybe after unlocking red_door_1 and moving to room1, then back to room2, then goto blue_door_2. But how?

Alternatively, after getting to room4 through other doors, can we goto blue_door_2 from room4? But blue_door_2 connects room2 and room4. So in room4, blue_door_2 is present. But blue_door_2 is locked, so we can't go through it, but can we goto it from room4? If we're in room4, we can goto blue_door_2 (since it's connecting room4 and room2), but the preconditions for gotodoor require that there's no object blocking the position in front of the door in the current room. Assuming no blockage, we can do that. Then, being in front of blue_door_2 in room4 would satisfy the first constraint. But at that point, we need to have held red_ball_2 earlier. Since we picked red_ball_2 in room1, and perhaps dropped it somewhere.

Wait, but if we're in room4 and need to be in front of blue_door_2, which is in room4. So steps:

After reaching room4 (via room3 and purple_door_1), then goto blue_door_2 in room4. But how? Let's outline:

1. Start in room2.
2. gotodoor red_door_1 room2 room1.
3. toggle red_door_1 (unlock).
4. gotoroom room2 room1 red_door_1. Now in room1.
5. gotoobject red_ball_2 room1.
6. pick red_ball_2. Now holding it.
7. gotodoor blue_door_1 room1 room3.
8. toggle blue_door_1 (unlock).
9. gotoroom room1 room3 blue_door_1. Now in room3.
10. goto purple_door_1 room3 room4.
11. toggle purple_door_1 (unlock).
12. gotoroom room3 room4 purple_door_1. Now in room4. (This satisfies the room4 constraint because we were holding red_ball_2 when entering.)
13. Now, to satisfy the blue_door_2 front constraint: goto blue_door_2 in room4.
14. gotodoor blue_door_2 room4 room2. Now in front of blue_door_2. Since we were holding red_ball_2 earlier (step6-12), this satisfies the constraint that if in front of blue_door_2, must have held red_ball_2 before.
15. Then, goto purple_door_1 again (if needed) to be in front of it while it's unlocked.

But wait, the goal is to be in front of a purple door connecting room3 and room4 (which is purple_door_1) while it's unlocked. So after step12, we're in room4. We can then goto purple_door_1 in room4 (step13: gotodoor purple_door_1 room4 room3). Then, we're in front of it. Since we toggled it in step11, it's unlocked. So that would achieve the goal.

But wait, step14 in the above is going to blue_door_2. So the plan would be:

1. goto red_door_1 from room2.
2. toggle to unlock.
3. move to room1.
4. pick red_ball_2.
5. goto blue_door_1 in room1.
6. toggle to unlock.
7. move to room3.
8. goto purple_door_1 in room3.
9. toggle to unlock.
10. move to room4.
11. goto blue_door_2 in room4 (to satisfy constraint).
12. Then, goto purple_door_1 in room4 to fulfill the goal.

But wait, after step10 (in room4), the next step is to goto blue_door_2 in room4. That would require:

Action: gotodoor blue_door_2 room4 room2. Preconditions: in room4 (which we are), and no object blocking. Assuming that's possible. Then, we are in front of blue_door_2. Then, we need to ensure that at some point, we were holding red_ball_2. We picked it in step4 and still holding it until when? If we need to drop it, but the constraint only requires that in some state before being in front of blue_door_2, we were holding red_ball_2. So even if we are still holding it when in front of blue_door_2, that's okay. But after step4, we are holding red_ball_2 until when? If we drop it later, but in the steps above, we never drop it. So when we goto blue_door_2 in room4 (step11), we are still holding red_ball_2. But the constraint says that if you are in front of blue_door_2, there must be an earlier state where you were holding red_ball_2. Since we picked it in step4 and are still holding it in step11, that's acceptable. However, the "drop" action requires being in front of an empty position. So maybe after step10 (in room4), we can drop red_ball_2 in room4. But that's optional unless needed.

But according to the plan above, after step10 (in room4), we can go to blue_door_2 (step11), which would satisfy the constraint. Then, after that, we can proceed to purple_door_1.

But the goal requires being in front of purple_door_1 (which is in room4), and it being unlocked. So after step11 (in front of blue_door_2), we can then goto purple_door_1 in room4 (step12), and that's the goal state.

So the plan would look like:

1. gotodoor red_door_1 room2 room1
2. toggle red_door_1
3. gotoroom room2 room1 red_door_1
4. gotoobject red_ball_2 room1
5. pick red_ball_2 room1
6. gotodoor blue_door_1 room1 room3
7. toggle blue_door_1
8. gotoroom room1 room3 blue_door_1
9. gotodoor purple_door_1 room3 room4
10. toggle purple_door_1
11. gotoroom room3 room4 purple_door_1
12. gotodoor blue_door_2 room4 room2
13. gotodoor purple_door_1 room4 room3
14. (We are in front of purple_door_1, which is unlocked)

But wait, step13 would be gotodoor purple_door_1 room4 room3. Then, we are in front of it. The goal is achieved because purple_door_1 is purple, connects room3 and room4, we're in front of it, and it's unlocked.

This plan seems to satisfy all constraints:

- Being in front of blue_door_2 (step12) after having held red_ball_2 (steps5-12, since we're still holding it unless we drop it). Wait, but in step12, are we still holding red_ball_2? Because we never dropped it. So yes, we're holding it when we goto blue_door_2. But the constraint says if you are in front of blue_door_2, there must be an earlier state where you were holding red_ball_2. But in this case, the state where you are holding red_ball_2 (steps5 onwards) is earlier than step12. So that's satisfied.

- blue_door_2 remains locked throughout (we never toggled it).

- Been in room4 (step11).

- When entering room4 (step11), we were holding red_ball_2, which satisfies the condition that either green_box_1 is in room4 (it's not, it's in room3) or we're holding something (yes).

The goal is achieved in step13: in front of purple_door_1, which is unlocked.

But wait, after step11, when we enter room4, we need to drop the ball if we want to do other actions. Because some actions require not holding anything, like picking up another object. But in this plan, after step11, we go to blue_door_2 (step12) while holding red_ball_2. Then goto purple_door_1 (step13) while still holding it. Then, do we need to drop it? The goal doesn't require us to drop it. But the "drop" action requires being in front of an empty position, which we can do if needed. But in this plan, perhaps it's not necessary.

But the problem is that the "gotoroom" action makes you no longer in front of any object. So after step11, when you enter room4, you are not in front of anything. Then, you need to go to blue_door_2 (step12), which is allowed because you're in room4 and blue_door_2 connects room4 and room2. Then, after that, goto purple_door_1 (step13).

This plan seems to meet all requirements. Let's count the steps:

1. gotodoor red_door_1 room2 room1
2. toggle red_door_1
3. gotoroom room2 room1 red_door_1
4. gotoobject red_ball_2 room1
5. pick red_ball_2 room1
6. gotodoor blue_door_1 room1 room3
7. toggle blue_door_1
8. gotoroom room1 room3 blue_door_1
9. gotodoor purple_door_1 room3 room4
10. toggle purple_door_1
11. gotoroom room3 room4 purple_door_1
12. gotodoor blue_door_2 room4 room2
13. gotodoor purple_door_1 room4 room3

Then, we are in front of purple_door_1 (unlocked), satisfying the goal. All constraints are met.

But wait, when we do step12 (gotodoor blue_door_2 room4 room2), we are in front of blue_door_2. Since we are holding red_ball_2 from step5 until now, the constraint that being in front of blue_door_2 requires having held red_ball_2 earlier is satisfied. Also, blue_door_2 remains locked because we never toggled it. The step where we enter room4 (step11) satisfies the constraint that we were holding an object (red_ball_2) when entering. All other constraints seem met.

Is there a shorter plan? Let's see. For example, can we avoid going back to room4's blue_door_2? Probably not, because we need to be in front of it at least once. The alternative path would require being in front of blue_door_2 in room2, but that would require going back to room2 after room4, which might be longer. So the current plan seems optimal.
