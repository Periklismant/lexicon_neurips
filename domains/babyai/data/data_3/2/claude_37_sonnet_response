Let me break down this problem step-by-step:

### The Problem

1. We're in a 2D gridworld with 4 rooms arranged in a square (room_1 in NW, room_2 in SW, room_3 in NE, room_4 in SE).
2. The rooms are connected by doors: room_1-room_2 (blue_door_1), room_1-room_3 (purple_door_1), room_2-room_4 (yellow_door_1), room_3-room_4 (grey_door_1).
3. Initially, all doors are locked, we are in room_1, and various objects are scattered around the rooms.
4. Our goal is to be in room_4, in front of red_ball_1.

### The Constraints:

1. At some point, either grey_door_1 should be unlocked or we should be holding green_ball_1.
2. At some point, either we should be in front of an empty position or holding red_box_2.
3. At some point, we should be in front of blue_door_1.
4. After being in front of blue_door_1, at some point either purple_door_1 should be unlocked or we should be holding an object.

### Initial State:

- We are in room_1.
- Objects in room_1: green_box_1, yellow_box_1, green_box_2.
- Objects in room_2: red_box_1.
- Objects in room_3: green_ball_1, red_box_2.
- Objects in room_4: red_ball_1, grey_box_1.
- All doors are locked.
- We are not holding any object.
- We have visited room_1.

### Goal:

- We need to be in room_4, in front of red_ball_1.

Now, let's think about the plan:

To achieve the goal, we need to:
1. Navigate to room_4.
2. Go in front of red_ball_1.

To navigate to room_4, we have two potential paths:
- room_1 -> room_2 -> room_4
- room_1 -> room_3 -> room_4

But all doors are initially locked, so we need to unlock them.

Let's also consider the constraints while planning:

1. To satisfy the first constraint, we'll need to either unlock grey_door_1 or pick up green_ball_1.
2. To satisfy the second constraint, we'll need to either go in front of an empty position or pick up red_box_2.
3. To satisfy the third constraint, we need to go in front of blue_door_1.
4. After being in front of blue_door_1, we need to either unlock purple_door_1 or pick up an object.

Given these constraints and the goal, let's try to come up with a plan:

1. To navigate to room_4, we'll go via room_1 -> room_2 -> room_4.
2. We'll unlock blue_door_1 to go from room_1 to room_2.
3. To satisfy constraint 4, after being in front of blue_door_1, we'll pick up an object.
4. We'll unlock yellow_door_1 to go from room_2 to room_4.
5. In room_4, we'll go in front of red_ball_1.

Now, let's refine the plan with the specific actions we need to take:

First, I need to figure out the path from where I start to room_4 where red_ball_1 is. Since I start in room_1, I need to go to an adjacent room first. I can go to room_2 via blue_door_1 or to room_3 via purple_door_1. Let's say I'll go to room_2 first.

Here's a step-by-step plan:

1. Go in front of blue_door_1 in room_1.
2. Unlock blue_door_1.
3. After being in front of blue_door_1, pick up an object to satisfy constraint 4. Let's pick up green_box_1.
4. Go to room_2 using blue_door_1.
5. In room_2, go in front of yellow_door_1.
6. Unlock yellow_door_1.
7. Go to room_4 using yellow_door_1.
8. Drop green_box_1 (we picked it up in step 3) to have empty hands.
9. Go in front of red_ball_1 in room_4.

But, wait, I'm forgetting the other constraints:

1. At some point, either grey_door_1 should be unlocked or we should be holding green_ball_1.
2. At some point, either we should be in front of an empty position or holding red_box_2.

To satisfy constraint 1, we could either unlock grey_door_1 or pick up green_ball_1. Since green_ball_1 is in room_3, which we weren't planning to visit, let's adjust our plan to include room_3.

To satisfy constraint 2, we could go in front of an empty position. That's simpler than picking up red_box_2, which is in room_3.

Adjusting our plan:

1. Go in front of blue_door_1 in room_1.
2. Unlock blue_door_1.
3. To satisfy constraint 4 (which kicks in after being in front of blue_door_1), let's pick up green_box_1, which is in room_1.
4. Go to room_2 using blue_door_1.
5. Drop green_box_1.
6. Go in front of empty (to satisfy constraint 2).
7. Go in front of purple_door_1. (Wait, this is not correct - purple_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3, not room_2 and room_3. Let's revise.)

I need to be careful about the room connections. Let me list them clearly:
- room_1-room_2 are connected via blue_door_1
- room_1-room_3 are connected via purple_door_1
- room_2-room_4 are connected via yellow_door_1
- room_3-room_4 are connected via grey_door_1

Given these, I'll restart my plan:

1. Go in front of blue_door_1 in room_1.
2. Unlock blue_door_1.
3. After being in front of blue_door_1, to satisfy constraint 4, pick up an object. Let's pick up green_box_1.
4. Go to room_2 using blue_door_1.
5. Go in front of empty (to satisfy constraint 2).
6. Go in front of yellow_door_1.
7. Unlock yellow_door_1.
8. Go to room_4 using yellow_door_1.
9. Now, I need to unlock grey_door_1 or hold green_ball_1 to satisfy constraint 1.
   
This is a bit of a challenge. To unlock grey_door_1, I'd need to be in front of it, but to do that, I'd need to be in room_3 or room_4. I'm in room_4, so I can go to grey_door_1. But to hold green_ball_1, I'd need to go to room_3, which means I'd have to go back from room_4 to room_3. Let's just unlock grey_door_1 since we're in room_4.

9. Drop green_box_1.
10. Go in front of grey_door_1.
11. Unlock grey_door_1 (to satisfy constraint 1).
12. Go in front of red_ball_1 in room_4.

Wait, there's another issue. If we're holding green_box_1, we'd need to drop it to pick up red_ball_1, but the goal doesn't mention holding red_ball_1, it just says to be in front of it. So, I guess we don't need to pick up red_ball_1, just go in front of it.

But let's see if my plan is valid:

Actually, let me backtrack a bit. I think I'm overthinking this. Let's simplify the plan:

1. Start in room_1.
2. Go in front of blue_door_1 in room_1 (satisfying constraint 3).
3. Unlock blue_door_1.
4. After being in front of blue_door_1, to satisfy constraint 4, pick up an object or unlock purple_door_1. Let's go in front of purple_door_1.
5. Unlock purple_door_1.
6. Now, back to the plan. Go to room_2 using blue_door_1.
7. Go in front of yellow_door_1.
8. Unlock yellow_door_1.
9. Go to room_4 using yellow_door_1.
10. Go in front of grey_door_1.
11. Unlock grey_door_1 (to satisfy constraint 1).
12. Go in front of empty (to satisfy constraint 2), to release our spot from in front of the door.
13. Go in front of red_ball_1 in room_4.

Hmm, I realize there's an issue with my plan. I'm trying to unlock purple_door_1 after being in front of blue_door_1, but to do that, I'd need to move away from blue_door_1, which means I'd be no longer in front of it.

Let me think again about constraint 4: After being in front of blue_door_1, at some point either purple_door_1 should be unlocked or we should be holding an object.

I guess I can consider "at some point" to mean any state after that. So, I can first be in front of blue_door_1, then at some later state, unlock purple_door_1 or hold an object. Let's try it:

1. Start in room_1.
2. Go in front of blue_door_1 in room_1 (satisfying constraint 3).
3. Unlock blue_door_1.
4. Go to room_2 using blue_door_1.
5. Here, to satisfy constraint 4, at a later state we need to unlock purple_door_1 or hold an object.
6. Go in front of empty (to satisfy constraint 2).
7. Go in front of yellow_door_1.
8. Unlock yellow_door_1.
9. Go to room_4 using yellow_door_1.
10. Go in front of grey_door_1.
11. Unlock grey_door_1 (to satisfy constraint 1).
12. Go in front of red_ball_1 in room_4.

Actually, I'm still confused about constraint 4. Let me check. After being in front of blue_door_1, at some point either purple_door_1 should be unlocked or we should be holding an object.

I think this means that after standing in front of blue_door_1, we need to ensure that we either unlock purple_door_1 or pick up an object. I'm not sure if the constraint is satisfied if we just happen to pick up an object later for unrelated reasons. Maybe it's best for me to intentionally satisfy this constraint.

But let's again be clear about the constraint: "If expression 'you are in front of blue_door_1' holds in some state s, then expression 'At least one of the following conditions is true: "purple_door_1 is not locked", "you are holding some object"' must hold at s or at some state after s".

This means that after being in front of blue_door_1, at some point (either immediately or at a future state), purple_door_1 should be unlocked or we should be holding an object.

So, the constraint doesn't require a causal relationship, it just needs to be true at some point after standing in front of blue_door_1. Given that, I should be good if, after standing in front of blue_door_1, we pick up an object or unlock purple_door_1.

Alright, let's finalize the plan:

1. Start in room_1.
2. Go in front of one of the objects (let's say green_box_1) in room_1.
3. Pick up green_box_1 (this is to satisfy constraint 4, which will kick in once we stand in front of blue_door_1).
4. Go in front of blue_door_1 in room_1 (satisfying constraint 3).
5. Unlock blue_door_1.
6. Go to room_2 using blue_door_1.
7. Go in front of empty (to satisfy constraint 2).
8. Go in front of yellow_door_1.
9. Unlock yellow_door_1.
10. Go to room_4 using yellow_door_1.
11. Go in front of grey_door_1.
12. Unlock grey_door_1 (to satisfy constraint 1).
13. Go in front of red_ball_1 in room_4.

Let's check if this plan satisfies all the constraints:
1. Constraint 1: At some point, either grey_door_1 is not locked or you are holding green_ball_1. This is satisfied in step 12 when we unlock grey_door_1.
2. Constraint 2: At some point, either you are in front of empty or holding red_box_2. This is satisfied in step 7 when we go in front of empty.
3. Constraint 3: At some point, you are in front of blue_door_1. This is satisfied in step 4.
4. Constraint 4: After being in front of blue_door_1, at some point purple_door_1 is not locked or you are holding an object. This is satisfied because after step 4, we are holding green_box_1 (which we picked up in step 3).

But wait, I think I'm forgetting something. If I pick up green_box_1 and then go to room_4 while holding it, I'd need to drop it before I can be in front of red_ball_1. Let me refine that part.

Actually, now that I think about it, I don't need to drop green_box_1 to go in front of red_ball_1. I can be in front of objects even while holding other objects. The action "gotoobject x r" only requires that I am in the same room as object x, not that my hands are empty.

So, let me correct my plan:

1. Start in room_1.
2. Go in front of green_box_1 in room_1.
3. Pick up green_box_1.
4. Go in front of blue_door_1 in room_1 (satisfying constraint 3).
5. Unlock blue_door_1.
6. Go to room_2 using blue_door_1.
7. Go in front of empty (to satisfy constraint 2).
8. Go in front of yellow_door_1.
9. Unlock yellow_door_1.
10. Go to room_4 using yellow_door_1.
11. Go in front of grey_door_1.
12. Unlock grey_door_1 (to satisfy constraint 1).
13. Go in front of red_ball_1 in room_4.

Actually, wait. I'm getting confused again. Let's double-check the actions and their preconditions and effects:

For "gotoobject x r": 
- Precondition: You may only go in front of an object x if you are in the same room as x.
- Effect: (i) if you were in front of some object or door x0, then you are no longer in front of x0 and (ii) you are in front of object x.

I don't see a requirement that I can't be holding something. So I can be in front of red_ball_1 even while holding green_box_1.

Now, let's also check if the plan is still optimal.

Actually, looking at this plan again, I think I need to revise. When I unlock blue_door_1, I'm in front of it, and at that point, I'm holding green_box_1. This satisfies constraint 4.

But for constraint 1, I'm going to unlock grey_door_1. Are there any other ways to satisfy this constraint that might make the plan more efficient? The constraint is: "At some point, either grey_door_1 is not locked or you are holding green_ball_1."

To satisfy this, I either need to unlock grey_door_1 or get green_ball_1. green_ball_1 is in room_3, and to get to room_3 from room_1, I'd need to unlock purple_door_1. So, the paths to satisfy constraint 1 are:
- path 1: Go to room_3 (via purple_door_1), get green_ball_1.
- path 2: Go to room_4 (via room_2 and yellow_door_1), unlock grey_door_1.

Either way, I need to unlock a door. Path 1 might be more efficient if I want to minimize the number of door unlocks. But path 2 might be more aligned with the goal, which is to be in room_4 in front of red_ball_1.

Path 2 might be quicker for the goal:
- room_1 -> room_2 -> room_4, which needs 2 door unlocks.

Path 1 followed by going to room_4:
- room_1 -> room_3 -> room_4, which also needs 2 door unlocks.

Both paths have the same number of door unlocks. Let's go with path 2 because it seems more aligned with the goal.

Actually, looking at my plan again, I think I have an error. In step 7, I'm going in front of empty to satisfy constraint 2. But the way I've interpreted the action, it doesn't seem right. Let's check the action again:

For "gotoempty": 
- Effect: After performing this action, (i) if you were in front of some object or door x0, then you are no longer in front of x0 and (ii) you are in front of an empty position.

I think the issue is that, I'm not sure why I thought constraint 2 would be satisfied by explicitly using the "gotoempty" action. From the constraint's perspective, it's satisfied if at some point I'm in front of an empty position, regardless of how I got there.

Given that, it might be that the constraint is naturally satisfied at some point in the execution of my plan. But to be explicit, I'll keep the "gotoempty" action.

There's one other concern I have: I'm not explicitly unlocking purple_door_1 in my plan. One of the ways to satisfy constraint 4 is to unlock purple_door_1. The other way is to be holding an object. Since I've chosen to pick up green_box_1 in room_1, satisfying the "holding an object" part of constraint 4, I don't need to unlock purple_door_1.

But, to be sure, let's explicitly check the constraint: "If expression 'you are in front of blue_door_1' holds in some state s, then expression 'At least one of the following conditions is true: "purple_door_1 is not locked", "you are holding some object"' must hold at s or at some state after s."

Given this, I believe the constraint is satisfied. After I'm in front of blue_door_1 (at step 4), the expression "you are holding some object" holds (since I've picked up green_box_1 in step 3).

Alright, let's finalize the plan again:

1. Start in room_1.
2. Go in front of green_box_1 in room_1.
3. Pick up green_box_1.
4. Go in front of blue_door_1 in room_1 (satisfying constraint 3, and since I'm holding green_box_1, constraint 4 is also satisfied).
5. Unlock blue_door_1.
6. Go to room_2 using blue_door_1.
7. Go in front of empty (to satisfy constraint 2).
8. Go in front of yellow_door_1.
9. Unlock yellow_door_1.
10. Go to room_4 using yellow_door_1.
11. Go in front of grey_door_1.
12. Unlock grey_door_1 (to satisfy constraint 1).
13. Go in front of red_ball_1 in room_4.

Let's check if this plan satisfies all constraints:
1. Constraint 1: At some point, either grey_door_1 is not locked or you are holding green_ball_1. This is satisfied in step 12 when we unlock grey_door_1.
2. Constraint 2: At some point, either you are in front of empty or holding red_box_2. This is satisfied in step 7 when we go in front of empty.
3. Constraint 3: At some point, you are in front of blue_door_1. This is satisfied in step 4.
4. Constraint 4: After being in front of blue_door_1, at some point purple_door_1 is not locked or you are holding an object. This is satisfied because after step 4, we are holding green_box_1 (which we picked up in step 3).

I think the plan is valid and satisfies all the constraints. But I want to double check the formulation of each action:

First, let's transform the steps 1-13 into the formal action format:

1. "gotoobject green_box_1 room_1": Go in front of green_box_1 in room_1.
2. "pick green_box_1 room_1": Pick up green_box_1 in room_1.
3. "gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2": Go in front of blue_door_1, connecting room_1 to room_2.
4. "toggle blue_door_1": Unlock blue_door_1 (since it's currently locked).
5. "gotoroom room_1 room_2 blue_door_1": Go to room_2 from room_1 using blue_door_1.
6. "gotoempty": Go in front of an empty position in room_2.
7. "gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_4": Go in front of yellow_door_1, connecting room_2 to room_4.
8. "toggle yellow_door_1": Unlock yellow_door_1 (since it's currently locked).
9. "gotoroom room_2 room_4 yellow_door_1": Go to room_4 from room_2 using yellow_door_1.
10. "gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3": Go in front of grey_door_1, connecting room_4 to room_3.
11. "toggle grey_door_1": Unlock grey_door_1 (since it's currently locked).
12. "gotoobject red_ball_1 room_4": Go in front of red_ball_1 in room_4.

Wait, I've been numbered my steps differetly. Let's be very careful about the steps.

Here's the formal action plan:

1. "gotoobject green_box_1 room_1": Go in front of green_box_1 in room_1.
2. "pick green_box_1 room_1": Pick up green_box_1 in room_1.
3. "gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2": Go in front of blue_door_1, connecting room_1 to room_2.
4. "toggle blue_door_1": Unlock blue_door_1 (since it's currently locked).
5. "gotoroom room_1 room_2 blue_door_1": Go to room_2 from room_1 using blue_door_1.
6. "gotoempty": Go in front of an empty position in room_2.
7. "gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_4": Go in front of yellow_door_1, connecting room_2 to room_4.
8. "toggle yellow_door_1": Unlock yellow_door_1 (since it's currently locked).
9. "gotoroom room_2 room_4 yellow_door_1": Go to room_4 from room_2 using yellow_door_1.
10. "gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3": Go in front of grey_door_1, connecting room_4 to room_3.
11. "toggle grey_door_1": Unlock grey_door_1 (since it's currently locked).
12. "gotoobject red_ball_1 room_4": Go in front of red_ball_1 in room_4.

This plan satisfies all the constraints and achieves the goal of being in room_4, in front of red_ball_1.

Alright, I think the plan is valid, and I've given it in the formal action format.

Actually, let's go through this step by step one more time, to double check:

Start: I'm in room_1. green_box_1, yellow_box_1, and green_box_2 are in room_1. All doors are locked. My hands are empty.

1. I go in front of green_box_1 in room_1 with: "gotoobject green_box_1 room_1".
2. I pick up green_box_1 with: "pick green_box_1 room_1". My hands are now full, holding green_box_1.
3. I go in front of blue_door_1, connecting room_1 to room_2, with: "gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2". This satisfies constraint 3.
4. I unlock blue_door_1 with: "toggle blue_door_1".
5. I go to room_2 from room_1 using blue_door_1 with: "gotoroom room_1 room_2 blue_door_1".
6. I go in front of an empty position in room_2 with: "gotoempty". This satisfies constraint 2.
7. I go in front of yellow_door_1, connecting room_2 to room_4, with: "gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_4".
8. I unlock yellow_door_1 with: "toggle yellow_door_1".
9. I go to room_4 from room_2 using yellow_door_1 with: "gotoroom room_2 room_4 yellow_door_1".
10. I go in front of grey_door_1, connecting room_4 to room_3, with: "gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3".
11. I unlock grey_door_1 with: "toggle grey_door_1". This satisfies constraint 1.
12. I go in front of red_ball_1 in room_4 with: "gotoobject red_ball_1 room_4". This achieves the goal.

And to verify the constraints are satisfied:
1. Constraint 1: At some point, either grey_door_1 is not locked or you are holding green_ball_1. After step 11, grey_door_1 is unlocked, so constraint 1 is satisfied.
2. Constraint 2: At some point, either you are in front of empty or holding red_box_2. After step 6, I am in front of an empty position, so constraint 2 is satisfied.
3. Constraint 3: At some point, you are in front of blue_door_1. After step 3, I am in front of blue_door_1, so constraint 3 is satisfied.
4. Constraint 4: After being in front of blue_door_1, at some point purple_door_1 is not locked or you are holding an object. From step 3 onwards, I am holding green_box_1, so constraint 4 is satisfied.

The plan is valid, achieves the goal, and satisfies all constraints. So the final plan is:

1. "gotoobject green_box_1 room_1"
2. "pick green_box_1 room_1"
3. "gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2"
4. "toggle blue_door_1"
5. "gotoroom room_1 room_2 blue_door_1"
6. "gotoempty"
7. "gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_4"
8. "toggle yellow_door_1"
9. "gotoroom room_2 room_4 yellow_door_1"
10. "gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3"
11. "toggle grey_door_1"
12. "gotoobject red_ball_1 room_4"

Actually, let's check if we are being optimal. I think this is an optimal plan, because I've avoided any unnecessary steps. Each step has a clear purpose and contributes to achieving the goal while satisfying the constraints.

I believe the plan is:

1. gotoobject green_box_1 room_1
2. pick green_box_1 room_1
3. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2
4. toggle blue_door_1
5. gotoroom room_1 room_2 blue_door_1
6. gotoempty
7. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_4
8. toggle yellow_door_1
9. gotoroom room_2 room_4 yellow_door_1
10. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3
11. toggle grey_door_1
12. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_4

Given as:

```
gotoobject green_box_1 room_1
pick green_box_1 room_1
gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2
toggle blue_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_2 blue_door_1
gotoempty
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_4
toggle yellow_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_4 yellow_door_1
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3
toggle grey_door_1
gotoobject red_ball_1 room_4
```

This looks like a correct and valid plan to my understanding.
