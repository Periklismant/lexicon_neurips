Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. The goal is to get a red ball into room_4, have the agent in room_4, and be in front of that red ball. The initial state has the red_ball_1 already in room_4, so maybe I don't need to move it. Wait, the goal is that there exists a red ball in room_4, which is already true. So the main tasks are to get the agent to room_4, be in front of red_ball_1, and satisfy all the constraints.

Let's look at the constraints:

1. At some point, either grey_door_1 is unlocked or the agent is holding green_ball_1.
2. At some point, either the agent is in front of empty or holding red_box_2.
3. At some point, the agent is in front of blue_door_1.
4. Whenever the agent is in front of blue_door_1, either purple_door_1 is unlocked or the agent is holding something, either at that state or after.

Starting in room_1. All doors are locked initially. So the agent needs to unlock doors to move between rooms. But how? The toggle action can unlock a door if the agent is in front of it. But to get in front of a door, the agent needs to be in a room connected by that door, and there's no object blocking the position in front of the door.

Looking at room_1's doors: blue_door_1 connects to room_2, purple_door_1 connects to room_3. Both are locked. The objects in room_1 are green_box_1, yellow_box_1, green_box_2. If any of these boxes are blocking the doors, the agent can't go to the door. Wait, the initial state doesn't mention any objects blocking doors. The problem states that "there is no object blocking the position in front of d in the room you are currently in" as a precondition for gotodoor. So if in room_1, the positions in front of blue_door_1 and purple_door_1 are not blocked, then the agent can go there. Since the initial state doesn't mention any blockages, maybe they are unblocked. So the agent can go to those doors.

So first, the agent needs to unlock the doors to move to other rooms. Let's think about the path to room_4. From room_1, the doors are blue (to room_2) and purple (to room_3). Then room_2 has yellow_door_1 to room_4, and room_3 has grey_door_1 to room_4. So possible paths: room_1 → room_2 via blue_door_1, then room_2 → room_4 via yellow_door_1. Or room_1 → room_3 via purple_door_1, then room_3 → room_4 via grey_door_1. Or a mix.

But all doors are locked. So the agent needs to toggle (unlock) them. But to toggle, the agent must be in front of the door. So the steps would involve going to the door, toggling it, then using gotoroom to move through.

But the agent starts in room_1. Let's see:

First, let's check the constraints. The third constraint requires being in front of blue_door_1 at some point. So the plan must include that. Also, when that happens, either purple_door_1 is unlocked or the agent is holding something, either at that state or after.

So to satisfy constraint 4, when the agent is in front of blue_door_1 (say, when unlocking it), we need to ensure that either purple_door_1 is unlocked by then or the agent is holding something then or later.

But initially, all doors are locked. So if the agent unlocks blue_door_1, that's part of the plan. Then, when the agent is in front of blue_door_1 (during the gotodoor action), the constraint 4 requires that either purple_door_1 is unlocked at that state or after, or the agent is holding something then or after.

Wait, the constraint says: if in some state s, the agent is in front of blue_door_1, then either in s or some state after s, purple_door_1 is unlocked or the agent is holding something.

So when the agent is in front of blue_door_1 (say, to unlock it), after that, they might go through the door to room_2, but during that time, they need to either unlock purple_door_1 (but that's in room_1) or hold something.

Alternatively, maybe after toggling blue_door_1, the agent could pick up an object in room_1, but the initial objects in room_1 are boxes. But the agent can pick up boxes. However, the green_ball_1 is in room_3. So if the agent is in room_1, they can pick up green_box_1, for example. Let's see.

Wait, the initial state in room_1 has green_box_1, yellow_box_1, green_box_2. So the agent can pick any of these. So if the agent is in front of blue_door_1 (to toggle it), then after that, when they go to room_2, perhaps they can pick up red_box_1 in room_2. But red_box_1 is in room_2. Alternatively, maybe after toggling blue_door_1, the agent can go to room_2, pick up red_box_1, which would satisfy the "holding something" part of constraint 4.

But let's think step by step.

Plan steps:

1. From room_1, go to blue_door_1 (which connects room_1 and room_2). Precondition: in a room connected by blue_door_1 (room_1 is), and no object is blocking. So gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2.

2. Toggle blue_door_1 to unlock it.

Now, constraint 3 is satisfied because we were in front of blue_door_1. For constraint 4, when the agent is in front of blue_door_1 (step 1), then in that state or after, purple_door_1 must be unlocked or the agent is holding something. At step 1, they are in front of the door, but haven't toggled it yet. Wait, step 1 is gotodoor, step 2 is toggle. After toggle, blue_door_1 is unlocked. But constraint 4 is triggered when the agent is in front of blue_door_1 (which is during step 1's effect). Wait, the state after performing gotodoor is that the agent is in front of blue_door_1. Then the next action is toggle. So during the state after gotodoor, the agent is in front of blue_door_1. So constraint 4 requires that in that state or after, either purple_door_1 is unlocked or the agent is holding something.

At that point (after step 1), the agent is in front of blue_door_1. At that state, purple_door_1 is still locked. So the agent must either unlock purple_door_1 at some point after, or hold something. So maybe after toggling blue_door_1 (step 2), the agent can go to room_2, pick up red_box_1. Then they are holding something, which satisfies the condition.

Alternatively, the agent could go to purple_door_1 in room_1, unlock it, but that would take more steps. Let's see.

But let's proceed. After unlocking blue_door_1 (step 2), the agent can go to room_2 via gotoroom room_1 room_2 blue_door_1. Then in room_2, pick up red_box_1. Then the agent is holding red_box_1, which would satisfy the "holding some object" part of constraint 4. So this would cover the requirement when they were in front of blue_door_1 (step 1) because later they are holding something.

But let's see the order. The constraint says that if the agent is in front of blue_door_1 in state s, then in s or some state after, the condition must hold. So if the agent picks up red_box_1 after that, then yes.

So steps after step 2 would be:

3. gotoroom room_1 room_2 blue_door_1. Now in room_2.

4. gotoobject red_box_1 room_2.

5. pick red_box_1 room_2. Now holding red_box_1. This satisfies the holding something part for constraint 4.

So now constraint 4 is handled.

Next, the agent needs to get to room_4. From room_2, the yellow_door_1 connects to room_4. But yellow_door_1 is locked. So the agent needs to unlock it. To do that, they need to go to yellow_door_1 in room_2. So steps:

6. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_4.

7. toggle yellow_door_1. Now it's unlocked.

8. gotoroom room_2 room_4 yellow_door_1.

Now the agent is in room_4. The red_ball_1 is already there. So the next steps are to go in front of red_ball_1 and drop if needed, but since the goal is to be in front of the red ball, which is already in room_4, perhaps just gotoobject red_ball_1 room_4.

But wait, the agent is holding red_box_1. To drop it, maybe, but the goal doesn't require dropping. Wait, the goal is to have the agent in room_4, in front of a red ball (which is red_ball_1). So the agent needs to be in room_4 and in front of red_ball_1. So steps in room_4:

9. drop red_box_1 room_4. But to drop, they need to be in front of an empty spot. Wait, no: the "drop x r" action requires that the agent is holding x and the position in front is empty. Wait, the effect of "drop x r" is that the agent is no longer carrying x, in front of x, and x is in the room. So when you drop, you end up in front of x. So if the agent is in room_4, holding red_box_1, and drops it, they would be in front of red_box_1, but the goal requires being in front of red_ball_1. So maybe instead, the agent should drop the box somewhere else first.

Alternatively, the agent could drop the box in room_4, then go to the red_ball_1. But since the agent is in room_4, they can gotoobject red_ball_1 room_4. But to do that, they need to be in room_4 and not holding anything. Because the "gotoobject" requires being in the same room as the object. So if the agent is holding red_box_1, they can still go to red_ball_1 as long as they are in room_4. Wait, no: "gotoobject x r" requires being in the same room as x. If x is in room_4, the agent must be in room_4. So yes, if the agent is in room_4, they can gotoobject red_ball_1 room_4. But they can't pick it up unless they drop the box first.

But the goal is to be in front of the red ball. So steps:

After entering room_4 (step 8), the agent is holding red_box_1. So to drop it:

9. gotoempty (in room_4) to get in front of an empty spot.

10. drop red_box_1 room_4. Now, they are in front of red_box_1, hands empty.

11. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_4. Now in front of red_ball_1.

But the goal is to have the agent in room_4, in front of a red ball (which is red_ball_1), so this would satisfy the goal.

But let's check the constraints.

Constraints:

1. At least one state where grey_door_1 is unlocked or holding green_ball_1. In the current plan, the agent is holding red_box_1, but not green_ball_1. And grey_door_1 is in room_3 and room_4. The agent hasn't interacted with grey_door_1. So this constraint is not satisfied yet. So the plan needs to include either unlocking grey_door_1 or holding green_ball_1 at some point.

But in the current plan, the agent never interacts with grey_door_1. So this constraint is not met. Therefore, the plan is invalid. So we need to adjust the plan to include unlocking grey_door_1 or picking up green_ball_1.

Green_ball_1 is in room_3. So maybe the agent needs to go to room_3 to pick it up. But how? Let's think.

Alternatively, the agent could unlock grey_door_1. But grey_door_1 connects room_3 and room_4. To unlock it, the agent needs to be in front of it. But the agent is in room_4, so they can go to grey_door_1 from room_4. Let's see.

In room_4, the agent can go to grey_door_1 (connects to room_3). So steps after entering room_4 (step 8):

9. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3.

10. toggle grey_door_1. Now it's unlocked. This satisfies constraint 1 because grey_door_1 is unlocked in this state.

Then, proceed to drop the box and go to the ball. But this adds steps. Let's see:

So the revised steps after step 8 (in room_4):

8. gotoroom room_2 room_4 yellow_door_1. (Now in room_4, holding red_box_1)

9. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3.

10. toggle grey_door_1. (Now unlocked. This meets constraint 1.)

11. Now, need to drop the box. So gotoempty in room_4.

12. drop red_box_1 room_4.

13. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_4.

Now, constraint 1 is satisfied because in step 10, grey_door_1 is unlocked.

Now, constraint 2: at some point, the agent is in front of empty or holding red_box_2. The agent is holding red_box_1, not red_box_2. So when does that happen? The agent needs to either be in front of empty or hold red_box_2.

In the current plan, the agent uses gotoempty in step 11, so that satisfies constraint 2. Because in step 11, they are in front of empty. So that's okay.

But wait, when they perform the gotoempty action, that puts them in front of an empty position. So that state would satisfy the second constraint.

So steps 11 (gotoempty) would meet constraint 2.

So the constraints:

1. Step 10: grey_door_1 is unlocked.

2. Step 11: in front of empty.

3. Step 1: in front of blue_door_1.

4. When in front of blue_door_1 (step 1), then after, the agent picks up red_box_1 (step 5), which satisfies the holding something part.

Now, the plan seems to meet all constraints. Let's check the steps again.

Another point: the agent needs to get to room_4. The path via room_2 requires unlocking yellow_door_1. But is there another path? Like via room_3. Let's see:

Alternative path: From room_1, unlock purple_door_1, go to room_3, then unlock grey_door_1, go to room_4.

But this would also need to consider the constraints.

But in the initial plan, we went via room_2, which required unlocking blue_door_1 and yellow_door_1. But unlocking purple_door_1 would be needed if the agent takes that path.

But in the original plan, the agent didn't unlock purple_door_1. However, constraint 4 requires that when the agent is in front of blue_door_1, then either purple_door_1 is unlocked or the agent is holding something. Since the agent is holding red_box_1 after step 5, that's satisfied.

But if the agent takes the other path (through room_3), maybe that would be shorter. Let's compare.

Alternative plan:

1. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_3.

2. toggle purple_door_1 (unlock).

3. gotoroom room_1 room_3 purple_door_1.

4. Now in room_3. Pick up red_box_2 (since constraint 2 requires holding red_box_2 or being in front of empty. Holding red_box_2 would satisfy that).

But the goal is to get to room_4. From room_3, unlock grey_door_1:

5. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4.

6. toggle grey_door_1.

7. gotoroom room_3 room_4 grey_door_1.

Now in room_4. Then gotoobject red_ball_1 room_4.

But in this path, the constraints:

Constraint 3 requires being in front of blue_door_1. This plan doesn't do that. So this plan would fail because constraint 3 is not met.

So the original path via blue_door_1 is necessary to meet constraint 3.

Therefore, the agent must go through blue_door_1 to satisfy constraint 3.

So the initial plan is necessary.

Now, let's check all steps again.

Original plan steps:

1. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2.

2. toggle blue_door_1.

3. gotoroom room_1 room_2 blue_door_1.

4. gotoobject red_box_1 room_2.

5. pick red_box_1 room_2.

6. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_4.

7. toggle yellow_door_1.

8. gotoroom room_2 room_4 yellow_door_1.

9. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3.

10. toggle grey_door_1.

11. gotoempty room_4.

12. drop red_box_1 room_4.

13. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_4.

But step 9: gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3. Then toggle. This unlocks grey_door_1, satisfying constraint 1.

Step 11: gotoempty, which satisfies constraint 2.

Step 1: in front of blue_door_1, meeting constraint 3.

Constraint 4: when in front of blue_door_1 (step 1), then in that state or after, either purple_door_1 is unlocked or holding something. In this plan, after step 1, the agent toggles blue_door_1, goes to room_2, picks up red_box_1 (step 5). So from step 5 onwards, the agent is holding something. So that satisfies constraint 4.

This seems okay.

But wait, after step 1, the agent is in front of blue_door_1. Then step 2 is toggle. Then step 3 is gotoroom. After that, the agent is in room_2. Then step 4 is gotoobject, step 5 is pick. So after step 5, the agent is holding red_box_1. So from step 5 onward, the agent is holding something. Therefore, constraint 4 is satisfied.

Now, the only remaining thing is to check if the plan is optimal. Is there a shorter way?

Alternative: After step 8 (in room_4), instead of going to grey_door_1, perhaps the agent can drop red_box_1 somewhere and then go to red_ball_1. But then constraint 1 isn't met. So they must interact with grey_door_1 or pick up green_ball_1. Since green_ball_1 is in room_3, which would require unlocking purple_door_1, which is in room_1. So that's another path. Let's see:

Alternative plan steps:

1. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2. (to satisfy constraint 3)

2. toggle blue_door_1.

3. gotoroom room_1 room_2 blue_door_1.

4. gotoobject red_box_1 room_2.

5. pick red_box_1 room_2.

6. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_4.

7. toggle yellow_door_1.

8. gotoroom room_2 room_4 yellow_door_1.

9. gotoempty room_4.

10. drop red_box_1 room_4.

11. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3.

12. toggle grey_door_1.

13. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_4.

In this case, step 12 unlocks grey_door_1, meeting constraint 1. Step 9 is gotoempty, meeting constraint 2. But this plan has more steps than the previous version. So maybe the original plan is shorter.

Wait, the difference is in steps 9-12. Original plan after step 8:

9. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3.

10. toggle.

11. gotoempty.

12. drop.

13. gotoobject.

In the alternative, steps 9-13:

9. gotoempty.

10. drop.

11. gotodoor.

12. toggle.

13. gotoobject.

So the same number of steps. But maybe combining steps.

Wait, after step 8 (in room_4, holding red_box_1), the agent can:

9. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3.

10. toggle grey_door_1.

11. drop red_box_1 room_4. But to drop, the agent needs to be in front of an empty spot. Wait, after step 9, the agent is in front of grey_door_1. So to drop, they need to gotoempty first.

So steps would be:

9. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3.

10. toggle grey_door_1.

11. gotoempty room_4.

12. drop red_box_1 room_4.

13. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_4.

This is necessary. So same steps.

Therefore, the plan is as efficient as possible.

Now, let's check all constraints again:

Constraint 1: grey_door_1 is unlocked in step 10. Yes.

Constraint 2: step 11 is gotoempty. Yes.

Constraint 3: step 1. Yes.

Constraint 4: after step 1, the agent picks up red_box_1 in step 5. So from step 5 onward, holding something. So when the agent is in front of blue_door_1 (step 1), the condition is met because after that, they hold something. So yes.

The final goal is achieved in step 13: agent in room_4, in front of red_ball_1.

So this plan seems valid and meets all constraints. Now, let's write it out in the required format.
