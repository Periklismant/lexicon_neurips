Okay, let's see. I need to solve this planning problem. The goal is to have a green door d that connects room_3 and room_1, be in front of it, and have it unlocked. Also, there are several constraints to satisfy. Let me start by understanding the initial state and the goal.

First, the initial state: the agent is in room_2. All doors are locked. The green door (green_door_1) connects room_1 and room_3. The goal requires that door d is green, connects room_3 and room_1, which is exactly green_door_1. So the target door is green_door_1. The final state needs the agent to be in front of green_door_1, which is in either room_1 or room_3. Since the agent starts in room_2, they need to move to either room_1 or room_3, but since green_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3, the agent must go to one of those rooms.

But the door is locked initially. So the agent needs to unlock it. However, to toggle a door, they have to be in front of it. So the agent needs to reach the door, which is in room_1 or room_3. But how can they get there if the doors are locked?

Let me check the connections. The agent starts in room_2. The doors from room_2 are red_door_1 (connects to room_1) and purple_door_1 (connects to room_4). Both are locked. So initially, the agent can't leave room_2 unless they unlock a door. But to unlock a door, they need to toggle it, which requires being in front of it. But how can they get in front of a door if the door is locked? Wait, the preconditions for "gotodoor" are that the agent is in a room connected by the door and that there's no object blocking the position in front of the door. So even if the door is locked, the agent can go in front of it. Then, once in front of the door, they can toggle it to unlock. Then, they can go through.

Wait, no. The "gotodoor" action doesn't require the door to be unlocked. It only requires being in a room connected by the door and no object blocking. So the agent is in room_2. The doors from room_2 are red_door_1 (to room_1) and purple_door_1 (to room_4). Both doors are locked, but the agent can still go in front of them as long as there's no object blocking. Are there objects blocking? Let me check the initial state. The objects in room_2 are yellow_ball_1. So unless the yellow_ball_1 is in front of a door, it's not blocking. The initial state doesn't mention any objects blocking doors, so assuming that the doors are not blocked by objects, the agent can go in front of red_door_1 or purple_door_1.

So first, the agent can go to red_door_1 in room_2. Wait, red_door_1 connects room_1 and room_2. So in room_2, the agent can go to red_door_1. Then, toggle it to unlock. Then, go through red_door_1 to room_1.

Once in room_1, they can go to green_door_1 (which connects room_1 and room_3). But green_door_1 is locked. So the agent can go in front of it in room_1, toggle to unlock it, then go to room_3. Then, in room_3, they can go to green_door_1 again (from the room_3 side) to be in front of it, ensuring it's unlocked. That would satisfy the goal.

But wait, the goal requires that the agent is in front of a green door connecting room_3 and room_1, which is green_door_1. So being in front of it in room_3 or room_1 would satisfy that. But the agent needs to have the door unlocked. So the steps would be:

From room_2:

1. goto door red_door_1 room_2 room_1 (since the agent is in room_2, which is connected via red_door_1 to room_1)
2. toggle red_door_1 (unlocks it)
3. Then, go from room_2 to room_1 via red_door_1 using gotoroom room_2 room_1 red_door_1
4. Now in room_1, go to green_door_1 (which connects to room_3)
5. toggle green_door_1 (unlock it)
6. Then go to room_3 via green_door_1
7. Now in room_3, go to green_door_1 again (gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_1)
8. Now, in front of green_door_1 in room_3, which is unlocked. This satisfies the goal.

But wait, the goal is that d is green, connects room_3 and room_1, agent is in front of d, and d is not locked. So step 7 would place the agent in front of green_door_1 in room_3, and after step 5, the door is unlocked. So steps 5 and 7 would be necessary. However, the agent needs to be in front of the door in the final state, so step 7 is needed after unlocking.

But the plan must also satisfy the constraints. Let's look at the constraints:

Constraint 1: At least once, the agent is in front of blue_box_1. Blue_box_1 is in room_3. So the agent must visit room_3 and go to the blue_box_1.

Constraint 2: At least once, red_door_1 is not locked. Which will happen after step 2, but we need to make sure that in the plan, after unlocking red_door_1, it's not locked again. But since the only action on red_door_1 is step 2, which unlocks it, that's okay.

Constraint 3: If red_door_1 is unlocked in some state, there must be an earlier state where red_ball_1 is in room_3. Red_ball_1 is initially in room_1. So the agent must move red_ball_1 to room_3 before unlocking red_door_1. Wait, but step 2 is unlocking red_door_1. So the unlocking of red_door_1 happens before moving red_ball_1. Wait, this is a problem. Because the constraint says that whenever red_door_1 is unlocked (which happens in step 2), there must have been a prior state where red_ball_1 was in room_3. But red_ball_1 starts in room_1, so unless the agent moves it to room_3 before step 2, this constraint is violated.

Wait, this is a critical point. The constraint is a conditional: if in any state red_door_1 is not locked, then there exists an earlier state where red_ball_1 was in room_3. So unlocking red_door_1 (step 2) would require that before that step, red_ball_1 was moved to room_3.

But red_ball_1 is in room_1. So the agent needs to get to room_1, pick up red_ball_1, carry it to room_3, drop it there, then proceed to unlock red_door_1. But how can the agent get to room_1 to get red_ball_1 if red_door_1 is locked? Because initially, red_door_1 is locked. So the agent is in room_2, which is connected to room_1 via red_door_1. But to get to room_1, the agent must unlock red_door_1. But unlocking red_door_1 requires that red_ball_1 is already in room_3. This is a chicken and egg problem.

Wait, this seems impossible. How can the agent move red_ball_1 to room_3 before unlocking red_door_1, if the agent can't reach room_1 (where red_ball_1 is) without unlocking red_door_1 first. Because red_door_1 is the door between room_2 and room_1, which is locked. So the agent is in room_2, can go to red_door_1 (in room_2), but can't enter room_1 until red_door_1 is unlocked. But unlocking red_door_1 would require that red_ball_1 was in room_3 before that. Which is impossible unless there's another way to get to room_1.

Wait, the initial connections: room_2 is connected to room_1 via red_door_1 and to room_4 via purple_door_1. Room_4 is connected to room_2 via purple_door_1 and to room_3 via red_door_2. Room_3 is connected to room_1 via green_door_1 and to room_4 via red_door_2.

So if the agent can go through purple_door_1 from room_2 to room_4, then from room_4 to room_3 via red_door_2 (but red_door_2 is locked), then from room_3 to room_1 via green_door_1 (which is also locked). But all doors are initially locked. So the agent can't go through any doors except by unlocking them.

So alternative path: agent is in room_2. Let's see:

1. Unlock purple_door_1 in room_2. But to unlock it, need to be in front of it. So:

- goto door purple_door_1 room_2 room_4
- toggle purple_door_1 (unlocks it)
- Then go to room_4 via purple_door_1.

From room_4, the doors are purple_door_1 (to room_2) and red_door_2 (to room_3). Both are locked except purple_door_1 is now unlocked. So from room_4, the agent can go to room_2 again. But to get to room_3, need to unlock red_door_2. But red_door_2 is locked. So agent can go to red_door_2 in room_4, toggle it to unlock, then go to room_3. Then, in room_3, they can go to green_door_1 (which connects to room_1) and unlock that. Then go to room_1. Once in room_1, pick up red_ball_1, take it back to room_3. Then go back to room_2, unlock red_door_1. But this path would satisfy the constraint.

Let me outline this possible path:

Initial steps:

1. goto door purple_door_1 in room_2 (since agent is in room_2)
2. toggle purple_door_1 (unlock)
3. gotoroom room_2 room_4 purple_door_1 (now in room_4)
4. goto door red_door_2 in room_4 (connecting to room_3)
5. toggle red_door_2 (unlock)
6. gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_2 (now in room_3)
7. goto door green_door_1 in room_3 (connecting to room_1)
8. toggle green_door_1 (unlock)
9. gotoroom room_3 room_1 green_door_1 (now in room_1)
10. Now, in room_1, pick up red_ball_1:
    - gotoobject red_ball_1 room_1
    - pick red_ball_1 room_1
11. Then, return to room_3 via green_door_1 (need to go back)
    - gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3
    - gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1
12. Now in room_3, drop red_ball_1:
    - gotoempty (to be in front of empty spot)
    - drop red_ball_1 room_3
13. Now, red_ball_1 is in room_3. So the constraint is satisfied that before unlocking red_door_1, red_ball_1 was in room_3.

Then, the agent needs to unlock red_door_1. But how to get back to room_2 to unlock red_door_1. Let's see:

From room_3, the agent can go back to room_4 via red_door_2 (already unlocked), then to room_2 via purple_door_1 (unlocked). Then, in room_2, go to red_door_1, unlock it, then proceed to room_1.

But why would the agent need to unlock red_door_1? Because the main goal is to have the green door (green_door_1) unlocked and be in front of it. So once the agent has red_ball_1 in room_3, the next steps are:

14. From room_3, go to room_4 via red_door_2.
15. From room_4, go to room_2 via purple_door_1.
16. In room_2, go to red_door_1 (room_2 to room_1)
17. toggle red_door_1 (unlock)
18. Now, red_door_1 is unlocked, and since red_ball_1 was moved to room_3 before this step, the constraint is satisfied.

Then, the agent can go to room_1 via red_door_1, then to green_door_1, unlock it (but it's already unlocked in step 8?), no. Wait, step 8 was toggling green_door_1 to unlock it. Then, when the agent is in room_1, they can go to green_door_1 again, which is now unlocked. Then proceed to room_3. Wait, but the goal is to be in front of green_door_1 (which is now unlocked) in room_3.

But maybe after step 8, the agent already has green_door_1 unlocked, but that's when they went from room_3 to room_1. So after step 8, green_door_1 is unlocked. Then, after moving red_ball_1 to room_3, the agent needs to get back to room_2 to unlock red_door_1. But why unlock red_door_1? Because maybe that's part of the path. Wait, no, the main goal is to have the green door (green_door_1) unlocked and be in front of it. So maybe after step 8, the green_door_1 is already unlocked. Then, the agent can go back to room_3 and be in front of green_door_1 there. But how?

Wait, the final goal is to have the agent in front of green_door_1 (which is green, connects room_3 and room_1, and is unlocked). So after step 8, green_door_1 is unlocked. The agent is in room_1. Then, they can go to green_door_1 in room_1, but being in front of it in room_1 would satisfy the goal? Or does it have to be in room_3?

The goal states that d connects room_3 and room_1. So the door is between those two rooms, and being in front of it in either room would be acceptable. So the agent could be in room_3, go to green_door_1 (gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_1), and that's the final step.

But the current path after step 13 (red_ball_1 in room_3) is:

Agent is in room_3. Then, they need to go to room_4, then room_2, unlock red_door_1 (step 17), then go to room_1, then back to room_3 via green_door_1. But maybe there's a more optimal path.

Wait, perhaps the agent can proceed as follows:

After moving red_ball_1 to room_3 (step 13), the agent is in room_3. Then, they can go to green_door_1 in room_3 (gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_1). Then, since green_door_1 is already unlocked (from step 8), they can toggle it if needed, but no, the goal is to have it not locked. So if it's already unlocked, that's fine. Then, the agent is in front of green_door_1 in room_3, which is unlocked. So this would satisfy the goal.

But how does the agent get to room_3 again after dropping red_ball_1 there?

Wait, after step 12, the agent is in room_3. So step 13 is agent in room_3. So steps 14-17 are unnecessary if the agent can directly go to green_door_1 from room_3. Wait, but step 8 was toggling green_door_1 when the agent was in room_3. So after step 8, green_door_1 is unlocked. Then, when the agent is in room_3, they can go to green_door_1 (gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_1), which would place them in front of it. Then, that's the final state. But also, the agent needs to have satisfied the constraints.

So let me check the constraints again:

Constraint 1: Must be in front of blue_box_1 at some point. blue_box_1 is in room_3. So the agent can do that when in room_3. For example, after arriving in room_3 (step 6), they can gotoobject blue_box_1 room_3. Then pick it up? No, but the constraint is just to be in front of it once. So adding that step.

Constraint 2: red_door_1 is not locked in some state. But in the current path, red_door_1 is still locked. Because the agent hasn't toggled it. Wait, the agent's path so far (steps 1-12) does not involve unlocking red_door_1. The constraint says that red_door_1 must be unlocked at least once. But according to the problem statement, the constraint is "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'red_door_1 is not locked'". So the agent must have a state where red_door_1 is unlocked.

But in the path I outlined earlier, after step 17, red_door_1 is unlocked. So steps 1-13, then steps 14-17 would unlock red_door_1. But why is that necessary? Because if the agent doesn't need to use red_door_1, why unlock it? But the constraint requires that red_door_1 is unlocked in at least one state. Therefore, the agent must toggle red_door_1 at some point to unlock it.

But according to constraint 3, if red_door_1 is unlocked in any state, then red_ball_1 must have been in room_3 in a previous state. So after moving red_ball_1 to room_3 (step 12), the agent can then proceed to unlock red_door_1 (step 17). So steps 14-17 are necessary to unlock red_door_1, thereby satisfying constraint 2. Then, after that, the agent can proceed to the goal.

But the goal is to be in front of green_door_1. So after unlocking red_door_1, the agent can go from room_2 to room_1 via red_door_1, then to green_door_1, but that's already unlocked. Wait, but maybe there's a shorter path. Let's see.

Alternative approach:

1. Start in room_2. Go to purple_door_1, unlock it, go to room_4. Unlock red_door_2, go to room_3. Unlock green_door_1, go to room_1. Pick red_ball_1, take it back to room_3. Drop it. Then, go back to room_2 via room_4. Then unlock red_door_1. Then go to room_1, then go to green_door_1, unlock it (already unlocked?), but need to be in front of it.

But maybe the steps can be optimized. Let's outline the full plan with all constraints:

Plan steps (roughly):

1. goto door purple_door_1 in room_2 (room_2 to room_4)
2. toggle purple_door_1 (unlock)
3. gotoroom room_2 room_4 purple_door_1 (now in room_4)
4. goto door red_door_2 in room_4 (connects to room_3)
5. toggle red_door_2 (unlock)
6. gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_2 (now in room_3)
7. goto door green_door_1 in room_3 (connects to room_1)
8. toggle green_door_1 (unlock)
9. gotoroom room_3 room_1 green_door_1 (now in room_1)
10. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_1
11. pick red_ball_1 room_1
12. gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3
13. gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1 (now in room_3)
14. gotoempty room_3
15. drop red_ball_1 room_3 (now red_ball_1 is in room_3)
16. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_3 (to satisfy constraint 1)
17. gotoempty room_3 (or proceed to next step)
18. gotodoor red_door_2 room_3 room_4
19. gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_2 (now in room_4)
20. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_2
21. gotoroom room_4 room_2 purple_door_1 (back to room_2)
22. gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_1
23. toggle red_door_1 (unlock, now constraint 2 is satisfied)
24. gotoroom room_2 room_1 red_door_1 (now in room_1)
25. gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3
26. gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1 (now in room_3)
27. gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_1 (now in front of green_door_1, which is unlocked)

This sequence would satisfy:

- Final goal: in front of green_door_1 (d), which is green, connects room_3 and room_1, and is unlocked.

- Constraint 1: Step 16 (gotoobject blue_box_1 room_3)

- Constraint 2: Step 23 (toggle red_door_1, now unlocked)

- Constraint 3: Before step 23 (unlocking red_door_1), step 15 has red_ball_1 in room_3.

- Constraint 4: The agent must be in room_3 and holding some object. This occurs when the agent is in room_3 and holding red_ball_1 (steps 11-13). So during steps 11-13, the agent is in room_3 (after step 13) and holding red_ball_1. So step 13: agent is in room_3, holding red_ball_1. So this satisfies the fourth constraint.

Now, check if all steps are necessary. For example, step 16 (gotoobject blue_box_1) is necessary for constraint 1. Then, steps 18-27 are necessary to unlock red_door_1 and get back to green_door_1.

But perhaps there's a shorter path. Let's see. After step 15 (red_ball_1 in room_3), the agent is in room_3. Then, to unlock red_door_1, they need to go to room_2. The fastest way is room_3 -> room_4 via red_door_2, then room_4 -> room_2 via purple_door_1. Then in room_2, unlock red_door_1. Then go to room_1, then back to green_door_1.

But after unlocking red_door_1 (step 23), the agent can go to room_1, then to green_door_1. But why not go from room_1 to green_door_1? Because the goal requires being in front of the door in either room. So the agent can be in room_1, go to green_door_1 (which is already unlocked), and that's the final step. Wait, but the problem states that the door must connect room_3 and room_1, and the agent is in front of it. So being in front of it in room_1 would satisfy the goal. So step 25 (gotoroom room_1 to room_3 via green_door_1) is not necessary. Instead, after step 24 (agent in room_1), they can go to green_door_1 in room_1 (step 25: gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3), which is already unlocked. Then, they are in front of green_door_1 in room_1. Does that satisfy the goal?

The goal is: "There is a door d such that d is green, room_3 and room_1 are connected via d, you are in front of d, and d is not locked."

Yes. So being in front of green_door_1 in room_1 would satisfy this. Then, the final steps could be:

After step 24 (agent in room_1):

25. gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3 (now in front of green_door_1)
   
That's it. No need to go to room_3. So this would save some steps.

So the revised plan would be:

1. goto door purple_door_1 room_2 room_4
2. toggle purple_door_1
3. gotoroom room_2 room_4 purple_door_1
4. goto door red_door_2 room_4 room_3
5. toggle red_door_2
6. gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_2
7. goto door green_door_1 room_3 room_1
8. toggle green_door_1
9. gotoroom room_3 room_1 green_door_1
10. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_1
11. pick red_ball_1 room_1
12. gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3
13. gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1
14. gotoempty room_3
15. drop red_ball_1 room_3
16. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_3 (satisfy constraint 1)
17. gotodoor red_door_2 room_3 room_4
18. gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_2
19. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_2
20. gotoroom room_4 room_2 purple_door_1
21. gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_1
22. toggle red_door_1 (unlock, satisfy constraint 2)
23. gotoroom room_2 room_1 red_door_1
24. gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3 (now in front of green_door_1, which is unlocked)

This plan has 24 steps. But maybe some steps can be optimized. For example, after step 15 (drop red_ball_1 in room_3), the agent can go to blue_box_1 (step 16) immediately. Then proceed to exit room_3.

But perhaps even shorter. Let's see if there's a way to reduce steps.

Wait, after step 15 (agent in room_3), they need to go to blue_box_1 (step 16) to satisfy constraint 1. Then, they need to exit room_3 to unlock red_door_1. So steps 17-20 are necessary.

Alternatively, after step 15, the agent can go to blue_box_1, then proceed to exit. But that's the same.

Another possible optimization: When the agent is in room_3 after step 13 (before dropping the ball), they could drop the ball, then go to blue_box_1. So steps 13-16:

13. gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1 (now in room_3)
14. gotoempty room_3 (drop)
15. drop red_ball_1 room_3
16. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_3

Then, exit room_3. That's the same.

Another possible optimization: When the agent is in room_3 after step 8 (unlocking green_door_1), before moving to room_1, they could gotoobject blue_box_1. But then they would have to pick it up, which may complicate things, but since the constraint is just to be in front of it, maybe:

After step 8 (in room_3):

7. goto door green_door_1 room_3 room_1
8. toggle green_door_1
9. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_3 (constraint 1)
10. gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_1
11. gotoroom room_3 room_1 green_door_1
...

This would save a step. So let's see:

Revised steps:

1. goto door purple_door_1 room_2 room_4
2. toggle purple_door_1
3. gotoroom room_2 room_4 purple_door_1
4. goto door red_door_2 room_4 room_3
5. toggle red_door_2
6. gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_2
7. goto door green_door_1 room_3 room_1
8. toggle green_door_1
9. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_3 (constraint 1)
10. gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_1
11. gotoroom room_3 room_1 green_door_1 (now in room_1)
12. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_1
13. pick red_ball_1 room_1
14. gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3
15. gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1 (now in room_3)
16. gotoempty room_3
17. drop red_ball_1 room_3
18. gotodoor red_door_2 room_3 room_4
19. gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_2
20. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_2
21. gotoroom room_4 room_2 purple_door_1
22. gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_1
23. toggle red_door_1 (unlock)
24. gotoroom room_2 room_1 red_door_1
25. gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3 (final step)

This reduces the steps by combining the blue_box_1 visit earlier. Now, step 9 is gotoobject blue_box_1, which satisfies constraint 1. Now, the plan is 25 steps. But is there a way to shorten it further?

Alternatively, after step 6 (agent in room_3), they can go to blue_box_1 before toggling green_door_1:

6. gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_2 (now in room_3)
7. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_3 (constraint 1)
8. goto door green_door_1 room_3 room_1
9. toggle green_door_1
...

This would save a step. So:

1. goto door purple_door_1 room_2 room_4
2. toggle purple_door_1
3. gotoroom room_2 room_4 purple_door_1
4. goto door red_door_2 room_4 room_3
5. toggle red_door_2
6. gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_2
7. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_3 (constraint 1)
8. goto door green_door_1 room_3 room_1
9. toggle green_door_1
10. gotoroom room_3 room_1 green_door_1 (now in room_1)
11. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_1
12. pick red_ball_1 room_1
13. gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3
14. gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1 (now in room_3)
15. gotoempty room_3
16. drop red_ball_1 room_3
17. gotodoor red_door_2 room_3 room_4
18. gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_2
19. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_2
20. gotoroom room_4 room_2 purple_door_1
21. gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_1
22. toggle red_door_1 (unlock)
23. gotoroom room_2 room_1 red_door_1
24. gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3 (final step)

Now, steps are 24. This seems better.

Now, check if all constraints are satisfied:

- Constraint 1: Step 7 (gotoobject blue_box_1 room_3) ✅
- Constraint 2: Step 22 (toggle red_door_1, now unlocked) ✅
- Constraint 3: After step 16, red_ball_1 is in room_3. Step 22 occurs after that. ✅
- Constraint 4: The agent must be in room_3 and holding an object. This happens in steps 12-14: agent is in room_3 (after step 14), holding red_ball_1. ✅

Yes, all constraints are satisfied.

Now, verify the plan's correctness:

- The final step (24) is gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3, which places the agent in front of green_door_1 in room_1. The door is green (green_door_1 is green), connects room_3 and room_1, and was unlocked in step 9. So the final goal is achieved.

Now, check if this is the shortest possible. Are there any redundant steps?

For example, after step 20, agent is back in room_2. Then, steps 21-24:

21. goto door red_door_1 room_2 room_1
22. toggle red_door_1 (unlock)
23. goto room_1 via red_door_1
24. goto door green_door_1 room_1 room_3

These steps are necessary to unlock red_door_1 (constraint 2) and get to green_door_1.

Is there a way to avoid going back to room_2? No, because the agent needs to unlock red_door_1 which is in room_2.

Alternative idea: After dropping red_ball_1 in room_3 (step 16), the agent could go directly to room_4 via red_door_2, then to room_2 via purple_door_1, unlock red_door_1, then go to room_1 and then to green_door_1.

Yes, that's exactly what steps 17-24 are doing.

So this plan seems optimal. Let's count the steps again:

1. goto door purple_door_1 room_2 room_4
2. toggle purple_door_1
3. gotoroom room_2 room_4 purple_door_1
4. goto door red_door_2 room_4 room_3
5. toggle red_door_2
6. gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_2
7. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_3
8. goto door green_door_1 room_3 room_1
9. toggle green_door_1
10. gotoroom room_3 room_1 green_door_1
11. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_1
12. pick red_ball_1 room_1
13. gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3
14. gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1
15. gotoempty room_3
16. drop red_ball_1 room_3
17. gotodoor red_door_2 room_3 room_4
18. gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_2
19. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_2
20. gotoroom room_4 room_2 purple_door_1
21. gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_1
22. toggle red_door_1
23. gotoroom room_2 room_1 red_door_1
24. gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3

This is 24 steps. Can we make it shorter?

Alternative idea: After step 16, the agent is in room_3. Instead of going through room_4 and room_2, maybe use the green_door_1 to go back to room_1, then use red_door_1 (if it's unlocked) to get to room_2. But red_door_1 is locked until step 22. So after step 16, agent is in room_3. They need to get to room_2 to unlock red_door_1. The fastest way is via room_4 and purple_door_1. So the steps are necessary.

Another optimization: When the agent is in room_3 after step 16, they can go directly to red_door_2 without gotodoor? No, gotodoor is needed before gotoroom.

Wait, to go from room_3 to room_4 via red_door_2, the agent must first goto the door in room_3. But red_door_2 is in room_3 and room_4. So in room_3, red_door_2 is present. So steps:

17. gotodoor red_door_2 room_3 room_4
18. gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_2

That's necessary. So steps 17-18 are needed.

Similarly, steps 19-20 are needed to go from room_4 to room_2 via purple_door_1.

Thus, I think this is the shortest possible plan given the constraints.
