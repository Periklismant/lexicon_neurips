Let me understand the problem:

We have a 2D gridworld consisting of 4 rooms arranged in a square formation. Room_1 is in the North-West, Room_2 is in the South-West, Room_3 is in the North-East, and Room_4 is in the South-East. There are 4 doors connecting the rooms, colored purple, green, purple, and blue.

Our task is to bring about a situation where a blue door is unlocked and we are in front of it.

Now let's understand the initial state:
- We are in room_4 initially.
- There are various boxes and balls in different rooms.
- All doors are locked.
- We have only visited room_4.

Now, let's consider the constraints:
1. Blue_door_1 must be locked at some point (which it already is in the initial state).
2. If blue_door_1 is locked, we must hold some object at that state or in a future state.
3. Blue_door_1 must be unlocked at some point.
4. If blue_door_1 is unlocked, there must be an earlier state where we are in room_1.
5. At some point, we must either be in front of purple_door_1 or holding green_box_1.

Let's think step by step. Our goal is to have a blue door that is unlocked and we are in front of it. The only blue door is blue_door_1, which connects room_4 and room_3. Since this door is initially locked, we need to unlock it.

According to constraint 4, before blue_door_1 is unlocked, we must have been in room_1. So we need to go to room_1, and then later unlock blue_door_1. To get from room_4 to room_1, we have a few options:
- Go from room_4 to room_2 via purple_door_2, then from room_2 to room_1 via purple_door_1.
- Go from room_4 to room_3 via blue_door_1, then from room_3 to room_1 via green_door_1.

But since all doors are locked, we need to unlock them. According to constraint 2, if blue_door_1 is locked, which it is initially, we must hold some object. Let's pick one of the objects in room_4.

Let's think about a plan:

1. We start in room_4.
2. Pick up an object in room_4, let's say purple_ball_1.
3. Go to purple_door_2 (which connects room_4 and room_2), and unlock it.
4. Go to room_2 via purple_door_2.
5. Go to purple_door_1 (which connects room_2 and room_1), and unlock it.
6. Go to room_1 via purple_door_1.
7. From room_1, we need to return to room_4 to be in front of blue_door_1, or to room_3 to access the blue door from the other side. Since we're already in room_1, it's shorter to go to room_3 via green_door_1, and then go to room_4.
8. Unlock green_door_1 (which connects room_1 and room_3) while in room_1.
9. Go to room_3 via green_door_1.
10. Go to blue_door_1 (which connects room_3 and room_4) while in room_3.
11. Unlock blue_door_1.
12. Stay in front of blue_door_1.

Now let's check if this plan satisfies the constraints:
- Constraint 1: Blue_door_1 is locked in the initial state, so this is satisfied.
- Constraint 2: When blue_door_1 is locked, we must hold some object at that state or in a future state. We pick up an object in step 2, so this is satisfied.
- Constraint 3: Blue_door_1 must be unlocked at some point, which we do in step 11, so this is satisfied.
- Constraint 4: If blue_door_1 is unlocked, there must be an earlier state where we are in room_1. We go to room_1 in steps 5-6, so this is satisfied.
- Constraint 5: At some point, we must either be in front of purple_door_1 or holding green_box_1. We go in front of purple_door_1 in step 5, so this is satisfied.

Actually, let me reconsider the plan, because I think I wasn't being specific enough about all the movments. I'll go through more step by step:

1. We start in room_4.
2. Go in front of purple_ball_1 in room_4 using "gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4".
3. Pick up purple_ball_1 using "pick purple_ball_1 room_4".
4. Go in front of purple_door_2 in room_4 using "gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_2".
5. Unlock purple_door_2 using "toggle purple_door_2".
6. Go to room_2 via purple_door_2 using "gotoroom room_4 room_2 purple_door_2".
7. Go in front of purple_door_1 in room_2 using "gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1".
8. Unlock purple_door_1 using "toggle purple_door_1".
9. Go to room_1 via purple_door_1 using "gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1".
10. Go in front of green_door_1 in room_1 using "gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3".
11. Drop the purple_ball_1 using "drop purple_ball_1 room_1".
12. Unlock green_door_1 using "toggle green_door_1".
13. Go to room_3 via green_door_1 using "gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1".
14. Go in front of blue_door_1 in room_3 using "gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_4".
15. Go in front of green_box_1 in room_3 using "gotoobject green_box_1 room_3". (this is to satisfy constraint 5)
16. Pick up green_box_1 using "pick green_box_1 room_3".
17. Go in front of blue_door_1 in room_3 using "gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_4".
18. Unlock blue_door_1 using "toggle blue_door_1".

Wait, in step 15, I realized there's a mistake in my plan. Let me reconsider:

Actually, I realize constraint 5 can be satisfied by being in front of purple_door_1. This happens in our plan when we're in room_2 and go in front of purple_door_1 to go to room_1. So we don't need to do any extra steps.

Let's also double-check our constraints again:
- Constraint 1: Blue_door_1 is locked in the initial state, so this is satisfied.
- Constraint 2: When blue_door_1 is locked, we must hold some object at that state or in a future state. We pick up an object in step 3, so this is satisfied.
- Constraint 3: Blue_door_1 must be unlocked at some point, which we do in step 18, so this is satisfied.
- Constraint 4: If blue_door_1 is unlocked, there must be an earlier state where we are in room_1. We go to room_1 in step 9, so this is satisfied.
- Constraint 5: At some point, we must either be in front of purple_door_1 or holding green_box_1. We go in front of purple_door_1 in step 7, so this is satisfied.

Let me adjust the plan one more time:

1. We start in room_4.
2. Go in front of purple_ball_1 in room_4 using "gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4".
3. Pick up purple_ball_1 using "pick purple_ball_1 room_4".
4. Go in front of purple_door_2 in room_4 using "gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_2".
5. Unlock purple_door_2 using "toggle purple_door_2".
6. Go to room_2 via purple_door_2 using "gotoroom room_4 room_2 purple_door_2".
7. Go in front of purple_door_1 in room_2 using "gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1".
8. Unlock purple_door_1 using "toggle purple_door_1".
9. Go to room_1 via purple_door_1 using "gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1".
10. Go in front of green_door_1 in room_1 using "gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3".
11. Unlock green_door_1 using "toggle green_door_1".
12. Go to room_3 via green_door_1 using "gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1".
13. Go in front of blue_door_1 in room_3 using "gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_4".
14. Unlock blue_door_1 using "toggle blue_door_1".

This plan should satisfy all the constraints and the goal condition.

Actually, I made another mistake earlier. We never specified that we should drop the purple_ball_1. Let's keep it simple and modify our plan:

1. We start in room_4.
2. Go in front of purple_ball_1 in room_4 using "gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4".
3. Pick up purple_ball_1 using "pick purple_ball_1 room_4".
4. Go in front of purple_door_2 in room_4 using "gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_2".
5. Unlock purple_door_2 using "toggle purple_door_2".
6. Go to room_2 via purple_door_2 using "gotoroom room_4 room_2 purple_door_2".
7. Go in front of purple_door_1 in room_2 using "gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1".
8. Unlock purple_door_1 using "toggle purple_door_1".
9. Go to room_1 via purple_door_1 using "gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1".
10. Go to an empty position using "gotoempty".
11. Drop purple_ball_1 using "drop purple_ball_1 room_1".
12. Go in front of green_door_1 in room_1 using "gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3".
13. Unlock green_door_1 using "toggle green_door_1".
14. Go to room_3 via green_door_1 using "gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1".
15. Go in front of blue_door_1 in room_3 using "gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_4".
16. Unlock blue_door_1 using "toggle blue_door_1".

Actually, let me reconsider. Dropping the purple_ball_1 is not a requirement, and the point of our plan would be to be as efficient as possible. Let's maximize efficiency by handling fewer objects.

So the action sequence is as follows:

```
gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4
pick purple_ball_1 room_4
gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_2
toggle purple_door_2
gotoroom room_4 room_2 purple_door_2
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1
toggle purple_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1
gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3
toggle green_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1
gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_4
toggle blue_door_1
```

However, upon reflection, I'm actually not sure that this plan satisfies constraint 2. Constraint 2 says:

"If expression 'blue_door_1 is locked' holds in some state s, then expression 'you are holding some object' must hold at s or at some state after s."

Since blue_door_1 is locked in the initial state, we need to be holding some object at some point, which we are. But then, in step 14, we unlock blue_door_1 while still holding purple_ball_1. What happens next is unclear, but if we still need to be in front of blue_door_1 in the final state, I'm a bit unsure how to set things up.

Let me read the goal again:

"There is a door d such that "The following conditions are all true: "d is blue", "you are in front of d", "d is not locked"""

So our final state needs to have us in front of blue_door_1, and blue_door_1 must be unlocked. We're already in front of blue_door_1 after step 15 of my revised plan, and after we unlock it, we'll still be in front of it.

So my plan from above does work:

```
gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4
pick purple_ball_1 room_4
gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_2
toggle purple_door_2
gotoroom room_4 room_2 purple_door_2
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1
toggle purple_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1
gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3
toggle green_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1
gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_4
toggle blue_door_1
```

After these steps, we're in front of blue_door_1, which is unlocked, and we're still holding purple_ball_1. This should satisfy the goal and all the constraints.

Let me double-check one more time:

- The goal: We need to be in front of a blue door which is unlocked. In the final state, we're in front of blue_door_1, which is blue and unlocked, after we toggle it. So the goal is satisfied.

Now the constraints:
- Constraint 1: Blue_door_1 must be locked at some point. It's locked in the initial state, so this is satisfied.
- Constraint 2: If blue_door_1 is locked, we must hold some object at that state or in a future state. In the initial state, blue_door_1 is locked, and later we pick up purple_ball_1, so this is satisfied.
- Constraint 3: Blue_door_1 must be unlocked at some point. We unlock it in the final step, so this is satisfied.
- Constraint 4: If blue_door_1 is unlocked, there must be an earlier state where we are in room_1. We go to room_1 before unlocking blue_door_1, so this is satisfied.
- Constraint 5: At some point, we must either be in front of purple_door_1 or holding green_box_1. We go in front of purple_door_1 in room_2, so this is satisfied.

This plan seems to satisfy everything, and I believe it's the most optimal plan.

Actually, I'm just double-checking once more. The action sequence is as follows:

```
gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4
pick purple_ball_1 room_4
gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_2
toggle purple_door_2
gotoroom room_4 room_2 purple_door_2
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1
toggle purple_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1
gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3
toggle green_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1
gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_4
toggle blue_door_1
```

Yep, this should be the optimal solution.
