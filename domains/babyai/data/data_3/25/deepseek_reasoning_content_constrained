Okay, let's tackle this planning problem step by step. The goal is to end up in front of a blue door that's unlocked. The blue door in question is blue_door_1, which connects room_3 and room_4. The initial state has me in room_4, and all doors are locked. So, first, I need to unlock blue_door_1. But there are several constraints to satisfy.

First, the constraints:

1. blue_door_1 must be locked in at least one state. Since it's initially locked, that's already covered as long as we don't unlock it immediately. But since the goal requires it to be unlocked, we'll have to toggle it at some point, which will change its state. So we need to make sure that when we unlock it, we first check that the initial locked state is considered in the plan.

2. If blue_door_1 is locked in some state, then I must be holding an object either at that state or later. So whenever blue_door_1 is locked (initially it is), I need to have held an object at some point after. Since the initial state has me not holding anything, I need to pick up an object before or after toggling the door. Wait, but the constraint says if blue_door_1 is locked in state s, then in s or some state after, I must be holding an object. Initially, blue_door_1 is locked, and I'm not holding anything. So that's a problem. So to satisfy this, I must pick up an object before or after the initial state where blue_door_1 is locked. But the initial state can't be changed, so the initial locked state of blue_door_1 must have a subsequent state where I hold an object. So I need to pick up an object at some point in the plan.

3. blue_door_1 must be unlocked in at least one state, which is the goal. So after toggling it, that's covered.

4. If blue_door_1 is unlocked in some state, there must be a prior state where I was in room_1. So before unlocking blue_door_1, I need to have been in room_1. Hmm. So I need to go to room_1 at some point before unlocking blue_door_1.

5. At least one state must have me in front of purple_door_1 or holding green_box_1. So either I go to purple_door_1 or pick up green_box_1.

Now, the goal is to be in front of a blue door (blue_door_1) that's unlocked. Let's outline the steps.

Starting in room_4. The doors from room_4 are purple_door_2 (connecting to room_2) and blue_door_1 (connecting to room_3). But all doors are locked. So I can't leave room_4 unless I unlock a door. But to unlock a door, I need to be in front of it and toggle it. But to get in front of a door, I need to be in the room where the door is connected, and there's no object blocking the position in front of the door. The initial state in room_4 has objects purple_ball_1 and grey_ball_1. Are any of these blocking the doors? The problem statement says that objects can block doors if they are in front of them. So if, for example, in room_4, the purple_door_2 and blue_door_1 are present. Are there objects blocking them? The initial state says that purple_ball_1 and grey_ball_1 are in room_4. If they are in front of the doors, then going to the door would be blocked. But the problem's initial state doesn't mention any objects blocking doors. Wait, the preconditions for "goto door" require that there's no object blocking the position in front of the door in the current room. So if in room_4, trying to goto a door, we need that position to be unblocked. Since the initial state doesn't state any objects blocking doors, perhaps they are not blocked. So maybe I can go to the doors in room_4.

Wait, but the initial positions of the objects are not specified beyond their room. So maybe the doors are not blocked. So in room_4, I can try to go to blue_door_1, but since it's locked, I can't go through yet. Wait, but to toggle a door, I need to be in front of it. So if I can go to blue_door_1 in room_4, then I can toggle it. But initially, I'm in room_4, and blue_door_1 connects room_4 to room_3. So the door is in both rooms? Or each door is in two rooms. So to go to the door from room_4, I can use gotodoor blue_door_1 room_4 room_3. Then, since the door is locked, I need to toggle it. But to toggle, I need to be in front of it. So if I can get in front of blue_door_1, then I can toggle it to unlock. Then, after unlocking, I can go to room_3 through blue_door_1.

But wait, the initial state says that all doors are locked. So to get in front of blue_door_1, I can do gotodoor blue_door_1 room_4 room_3. Then toggle it. But after toggling, it becomes unlocked. Then, the goal is to be in front of a blue door (blue_door_1) that's unlocked. So maybe after unlocking it, I can be in front of it. But after toggling, I'm already in front of it. Wait, the effect of toggle is just changing the lock state. So if I gotodoor blue_door_1 room_4 room_3, then toggle it, then I'm still in front of it. Then the goal is satisfied. But wait, the problem says that the goal is "There is a door d such that d is blue, you are in front of d, and d is not locked". So after toggling, blue_door_1 is unlocked, and I'm in front of it. So that would satisfy the goal. But what about the constraints?

Let's check the constraints:

1. blue_door_1 is locked in at least one state. Initially, it's locked. So that's covered.

2. If blue_door_1 is locked in any state, then in that state or after, I must be holding an object. The initial state has blue_door_1 locked, and I'm not holding anything. So I need to hold an object at some point after. So in this plan, after the initial state, I need to pick up an object. But in the current plan (go to door, toggle), I don't pick up anything. So this violates constraint 2. Therefore, the plan must include picking up an object after the initial state, to satisfy that whenever blue_door_1 is locked (which it is initially), I must hold an object at some point after.

So I need to pick up an object in room_4. The objects in room_4 are purple_ball_1 and grey_ball_1. So pick one of them. Let's say purple_ball_1. So:

1. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4
2. pick purple_ball_1 room_4
3. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_4 room_3
4. toggle blue_door_1
5. (now in front of blue_door_1, which is unlocked)

But wait, after picking up the object, I'm holding it. Then, when I go to the door, I can toggle it. But when I pick up the object, that satisfies the constraint that after blue_door_1 is locked (initially), I hold an object. So that's good. But then, after toggling, the door is unlocked, but the plan is not complete because the goal requires being in front of it, which we are after step 3 and 4. Wait, step 3 is gotodoor, which puts me in front of blue_door_1. Then step 4 is toggle, which requires being in front of it. Then after toggle, I'm still in front of it. So the final state would have me in front of blue_door_1, which is now unlocked. So that's the goal. But let's check the other constraints.

Constraint 4: If blue_door_1 is unlocked in a state, there must be a prior state where I was in room_1. Oh! So even if I unlock blue_door_1, I must have been in room_1 before that. But in the current plan, I started in room_4, never went to room_1. So this constraint is violated. Therefore, I need to go to room_1 before unlocking blue_door_1.

So how can I get to room_1 from room_4? The doors are all locked initially. So let's see the map:

Rooms are arranged as:

room_1 (NW) connected to room_2 (SW) via purple_door_1.

room_1 connected to room_3 (NE) via green_door_1.

room_2 connected to room_4 (SE) via purple_door_2.

room_3 connected to room_4 via blue_door_1.

So from room_4, the doors are purple_door_2 (to room_2) and blue_door_1 (to room_3). All doors locked. So to get to room_1, I need to go through room_3 or room_2. Let's see.

If I can unlock blue_door_1, then I can go to room_3. But that's the door we need to unlock for the goal. But constraint 4 says that before unlocking blue_door_1, I must have been in room_1. So that's a problem. So perhaps I need to find another path to room_1.

Alternatively, maybe unlock another door first. Let's look at the doors:

purple_door_1 connects room_1 and room_2.

green_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3.

purple_door_2 connects room_2 and room_4.

blue_door_1 connects room_3 and room_4.

All doors are locked. So starting in room_4, doors to room_2 and room_3 are locked. So I can't go directly to room_1. So perhaps I need to unlock another door first. But how? To unlock a door, I need to be in front of it and toggle it. But to get in front of a door, I need to be in the room where the door is. For example, to unlock purple_door_2 (connecting room_2 and room_4), I can go to room_4's side of the door. But purple_door_2 is in room_4 and room_2. So from room_4, gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_2. Then toggle it. But the problem is that initially, all doors are locked. So unless I can get to another door, but how?

Wait, but if I'm in room_4, I can attempt to go to the door purple_door_2. But to do that, I need to perform gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_2. The preconditions for gotodoor are that I'm in a room connected by the door and that no object is blocking the position. If that's possible, then I can go to the door, toggle it to unlock, then go to room_2. Then from room_2, perhaps go to room_1 via purple_door_1. But purple_door_1 is locked. So I would need to unlock that as well. But this seems complicated. Let's see.

Alternatively, perhaps the path is:

room_4 -> (unlock purple_door_2) -> room_2 -> (unlock purple_door_1) -> room_1. Then, after visiting room_1, go back to room_4 via purple_door_2 and room_2, then unlock blue_door_1.

But this requires multiple steps and toggling multiple doors. Let's outline the steps:

1. In room_4, go to purple_door_2 (room_4 to room_2). But since it's locked, can I go to the door? Yes, gotodoor is possible as long as no object is blocking. So:

- gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_2 (precondition: in room_4, door connects to room_2, no object blocking. Assuming no blocking, this is possible.

Then toggle purple_door_2 to unlock it.

Then, go to room_2 via gotoroom room_4 room_2 purple_door_2. Now, in room_2.

From room_2, need to go to room_1 via purple_door_1. But purple_door_1 is locked. So I need to unlock it. To unlock it, go to purple_door_1 in room_2.

But in room_2, the door purple_door_1 connects to room_1. So gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1. Then toggle it. Now, purple_door_1 is unlocked. Then, go to room_1 via gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1. Now, in room_1. This satisfies the constraint that before unlocking blue_door_1, I was in room_1.

But then, how do I get back to room_4 to unlock blue_door_1? From room_1, go back to room_2, then to room_4 via purple_door_2 (already unlocked), then go to blue_door_1, unlock it, and be in front of it.

But also, during this process, I need to handle the constraint that when blue_door_1 is locked (initially), I must have held an object at some point. So maybe I need to pick up an object in room_4, room_2, room_1, or room_3.

Wait, but in the initial plan where I unlock blue_door_1 directly from room_4, I need to pick up an object to satisfy constraint 2. So perhaps in this longer path, I can pick up an object in room_4 first. Let's see:

Alternate plan:

1. In room_4, pick up purple_ball_1.

   - gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4

   - pick purple_ball_1 room_4

   Now holding purple_ball_1. This satisfies constraint 2 because after the initial state (where blue_door_1 is locked), I am holding an object.

2. Then, go to purple_door_2 in room_4.

   - gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_2

3. Toggle purple_door_2 to unlock.

4. Go to room_2.

   - gotoroom room_4 room_2 purple_door_2

5. Now in room_2. Next, go to purple_door_1 in room_2.

   - gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1

6. Toggle purple_door_1 to unlock.

7. Go to room_1.

   - gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1

   Now in room_1. This satisfies constraint 4 (since after this, when we unlock blue_door_1, we have visited room_1).

8. Now, need to return to room_4. From room_1, go back to room_2 via purple_door_1.

   - gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1

9. Then from room_2 to room_4 via purple_door_2.

   - gotoroom room_2 room_4 purple_door_2

10. Now back in room_4. Need to unlock blue_door_1.

11. Go to blue_door_1 in room_4.

    - gotodoor blue_door_1 room_4 room_3

12. Toggle blue_door_1 to unlock.

Now, after step 12, I'm in front of blue_door_1, which is unlocked. So the goal is achieved.

But also, check other constraints:

Constraint 5: At least one state where I'm in front of purple_door_1 or holding green_box_1. In this plan, when we went to purple_door_1 in room_2 (step 5), we were in front of it. So that satisfies the condition of being in front of purple_door_1. So constraint 5 is satisfied.

Other constraints:

- blue_door_1 was locked in the initial state (satisfied).

- When blue_door_1 was locked (initial state), we picked up purple_ball_1 (step 1) so we were holding an object after. That satisfies constraint 2.

- blue_door_1 is unlocked in the end (satisfied).

- Before unlocking blue_door_1 (step 12), we were in room_1 (step 7), so constraint 4 is satisfied.

Also, constraint 3 requires that blue_door_1 is unlocked in at least one state, which is achieved in step 12.

Now, check if all actions are possible:

At step 1: gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4. Since we start in room_4, this is allowed. Then pick it up. Since we're not holding anything, that's allowed.

Then step 2: gotodoor purple_door_2 room4 room2. Possible since in room4 and the door connects to room2, no blocking objects.

Toggle purple_door_2 (unlock).

Then gotoroom to room2. Door is now unlocked.

In room2, step5: gotodoor purple_door_1 room2 room1. Possible. Toggle to unlock. Then go to room1.

Return to room2, then to room4. Then goto blue_door_1, toggle to unlock.

This seems feasible. Now, the plan steps:

But wait, when we are holding purple_ball_1, we need to drop it somewhere if we need to pick up another object. But in this plan, we are holding purple_ball_1 from step 1 to the end. Unless we need to drop it. But the actions don't require dropping unless we need to pick something else. But in this plan, we don't need to pick anything else. So holding purple_ball_1 throughout is acceptable. However, when we go through doors, we can still hold the object.

Wait, the gotoroom action only requires that the door is unlocked. So holding an object doesn't prevent moving through doors.

So the plan is:

1. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4

2. pick purple_ball_1 room_4

3. gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_2

4. toggle purple_door_2

5. gotoroom room_4 room_2 purple_door_2

6. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1

7. toggle purple_door_1

8. gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1

9. gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1

10. gotoroom room_2 room_4 purple_door_2

11. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_4 room_3

12. toggle blue_door_1

But wait, after step 12, we are in front of blue_door_1, which is unlocked, satisfying the goal. However, after step 12, the toggle action would unlock the door. But we need to ensure that in the final state, we are in front of it. Since after step 11, we are in front of blue_door_1 (from gotodoor), then step 12 (toggle) keeps us in front of it. So yes.

Now, check the constraints again:

- Constraint 5: Being in front of purple_door_1 (step 6: gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1) which is in front of the door. So that's covered.

- All other constraints are satisfied.

But wait, step 3: gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_2. Then step 4: toggle. Now, after step 4, the door is unlocked. Then step 5: gotoroom room_4 to room_2. Correct.

But when you perform gotoroom, you leave the current room and enter the new room. Also, you are no longer in front of any object or door.

Now, in step 6, gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1. Since we are in room_2, that's allowed. Toggling unlocks it.

Then step 8: gotoroom to room_1. Now in room_1. Then step 9: go back to room_2. Then step 10: back to room_4.

Then step 11: gotodoor blue_door_1 in room_4, step 12: toggle.

This plan seems to work. But let's count the steps. Are there any unnecessary steps? The optimal plan requires the shortest possible length. So perhaps there's a shorter path.

Alternative approach: Instead of going through room_2 and room_1, is there a way to reach room_1 from room_4 through another path? For example, via room_3? But blue_door_1 is locked initially. So from room_4, can't go to room_3. Unless we can unlock blue_door_1 first, but that would require going to room_1 first, which is the constraint.

Wait, no. The constraint says that if blue_door_1 is unlocked, there must have been a prior state in room_1. So unlocking blue_door_1 can only happen after visiting room_1.

So the path must include visiting room_1 before unlocking blue_door_1.

So the previous plan is necessary.

But let's check if there's a shorter way. Suppose instead of going all the way to room_1, but maybe there's a way to visit room_1 without unlocking multiple doors. But given that all doors are initially locked, we have to unlock doors to move between rooms.

Alternative idea: Since the constraint is to have been in room_1 before unlocking blue_door_1, maybe after unlocking purple_door_2 and going to room_2, then unlock purple_door_1 to go to room_1. Then return to room_4 via room_2, and then unlock blue_door_1.

Which is what the previous plan does.

But can we optimize steps?

For example, after step 8 (in room_1), maybe we don't need to return to room_4 immediately. Wait, but we need to be in room_4 to unlock blue_door_1. So after visiting room_1, we have to go back to room_4.

Alternatively, is there a way to go from room_1 to room_3 via green_door_1? But green_door_1 is locked. So need to unlock it.

Wait, room_1 is connected to room_3 via green_door_1, which is locked. So if in room_1, we can unlock green_door_1, then go to room_3, then to room_4 via blue_door_1. But that would require unlocking green_door_1 and blue_door_1. Let's see:

1. In room_4, pick up purple_ball_1.

2. Go to purple_door_2, unlock it.

3. Go to room_2.

4. Go to purple_door_1, unlock it.

5. Go to room_1.

6. In room_1, go to green_door_1, unlock it.

7. Go to room_3.

8. Go to blue_door_1 in room_3, unlock it.

But blue_door_1 is between room_3 and room_4. So after unlocking it, go to room_4 and be in front of it.

But this adds more steps. However, the plan might be longer. Also, the constraint requires that blue_door_1 is unlocked only after being in room_1. So if we unlock green_door_1 in room_1, go to room_3, then unlock blue_door_1, which is now possible because we've been to room_1. But does this plan satisfy the constraints?

Let's see:

- blue_door_1 is unlocked in room_3. So after unlocking, go to room_4 via blue_door_1. Then gotodoor blue_door_1 room_4 to be in front of it.

But this might require more steps. Let's outline:

1. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4

2. pick purple_ball_1 room_4

3. gotodoor purple_door_2 room4 room2

4. toggle purple_door_2

5. gotoroom room4 room2 purple_door_2

6. gotodoor purple_door_1 room2 room1

7. toggle purple_door_1

8. gotoroom room2 room1 purple_door_1

9. gotodoor green_door_1 room1 room3

10. toggle green_door_1

11. gotoroom room1 room3 green_door_1

12. gotodoor blue_door_1 room3 room4

13. toggle blue_door_1

14. gotoroom room3 room4 blue_door_1

15. gotodoor blue_door_1 room4 room3

Then, in step 15, I'm in front of blue_door_1 in room4, which is unlocked. But step 13 unlocks blue_door_1, but after moving to room4, I would need to go to the door again. Wait, after step 14, I'm in room4, but not in front of the door. So need to do gotodoor again.

So steps would be:

1. pick up purple_ball_1

2-8: reach room1.

9-11: go to room3 via green_door_1.

12-13: unlock blue_door_1 in room3.

14: go to room4.

15: goto blue_door_1 in room4.

Now, after step 15, I'm in front of blue_door_1 (unlocked), satisfying the goal.

But this is longer than the previous plan. So the previous plan is shorter.

Original plan steps: 12 steps.

Alternative plan: 15 steps.

So the first plan is better.

But let's count the steps in the first plan:

1. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room4

2. pick purple_ball_1 room4

3. gotodoor purple_door_2 room4 room2

4. toggle purple_door_2

5. gotoroom room4 room2 purple_door_2

6. gotodoor purple_door_1 room2 room1

7. toggle purple_door_1

8. gotoroom room2 room1 purple_door_1

9. gotoroom room1 room2 purple_door_1

10. gotoroom room2 room4 purple_door_2

11. gotodoor blue_door_1 room4 room3

12. toggle blue_door_1

So 12 steps. But is there a way to make it shorter?

For example, after step 8 (in room_1), we can go directly back to room_4 via the same path. But that's what steps 9-10 do.

Alternatively, after step 8 (in room_1), we need to return to room_4. The shortest path is room_1 -> room_2 -> room_4. Which requires steps 9 and 10.

Is there a way to avoid some steps?

Wait, when in room_1, can we use green_door_1 to go to room_3, then to room_4 via blue_door_1? But green_door_1 is locked initially. So we need to unlock it. Which would require steps:

In room_1:

9. gotodoor green_door_1 room1 room3

10. toggle green_door_1

11. gotoroom room1 room3 green_door_1

12. gotodoor blue_door_1 room3 room4

13. toggle blue_door_1

14. gotoroom room3 room4 blue_door_1

15. gotodoor blue_door_1 room4 room3

But this adds more steps. So it's not shorter.

Thus, the first plan is optimal with 12 steps.

Now, check if all preconditions are met in each step:

Step 1: gotoobject purple_ball_1 room4. Precondition: in room4 (yes). Yes.

Step 2: pick purple_ball_1 room4. Pre: in room4, holding nothing. Yes.

Step3: gotodoor purple_door_2 room4 room2. Pre: in room4, door connects to room2, no object blocking. Assuming no blocking, yes.

Step4: toggle purple_door_2. Pre: in front of door. After step3, yes.

Step5: gotoroom room4 to room2. Pre: door is unlocked (step4 toggled it to unlock). Yes.

Step6: gotodoor purple_door_1 room2 room1. Pre: in room2, door connects to room1. Yes.

Step7: toggle purple_door_1. Pre: in front of door. After step6, yes.

Step8: gotoroom room2 to room1. Pre: door unlocked. Yes.

Step9: gotoroom room1 to room2. Pre: door unlocked. Yes.

Step10: gotoroom room2 to room4. Pre: door unlocked. Yes.

Step11: gotodoor blue_door_1 room4 room3. Pre: in room4, door connects to room3. Yes.

Step12: toggle blue_door_1. Pre: in front of door. Yes.

All preconditions are met.

Now, check the constraints again:

- Constraint 5: Being in front of purple_door_1 (step6) or holding green_box_1. Step6 is in front of purple_door_1. So satisfied.

- Constraint 4: Before unlocking blue_door_1 (step12), was in room_1 (step8). Yes.

- Constraint 2: After initial state where blue_door_1 is locked, held an object (step2 onwards). Yes.

Other constraints are satisfied.

Thus, this plan is valid and optimal.
