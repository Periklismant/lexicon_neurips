Alright, I'm given a planning problem where I need to find a valid sequence of actions to bring about a goal, while satisfying constraints.

Let me break down the problem:

**Goal**: 
I need to end up in room_3, with a red box in room_3, with me not holding anything, and me being in front of the red box.

**Constraints**:
1. yellow_door_2 must always remain locked.
2. I must be in room_3 at some point.
3. If I am in room_3, there must be an earlier state where I am holding red_box_1.
4. I must be in room_4 at some point.
5. If I am in room_4, then at that state or in some later state, I must be in room_1 or holding grey_ball_1.

**Initial State**:
- I am in room_4.
- There are red boxes (red_box_1, red_box_2) in room_1 and room_3, respectively. 
- There's a grey ball (grey_ball_1) in room_1.
- Various other objects are in rooms 1, 3, and 4.
- All doors are locked.
- Doors connect rooms: room_1-room_2 (green_door_1), room_1-room_3 (grey_door_1), room_2-room_4 (yellow_door_1), room_3-room_4 (yellow_door_2).

Let's think about a plan:

The goal states that I need to be in room_3, with a red box in room_3, and me not holding any objects. There are two red boxes: red_box_1 in room_1 and red_box_2 in room_3. Since red_box_2 is already in room_3, it might be easier to use that. 

But constraint 3 says that if I am in room_3, there must be an earlier state where I am holding red_box_1. So I need to get red_box_1 from room_1 to room_3 at some point.

Constraint 1 says yellow_door_2 must remain locked, which means I can't use the direct connection from room_4 to room_3. Instead, I need to go from room_4 to room_2, then to room_1, and then to room_3.

Let's plan:

1. First, I need to unlock the yellow_door_1 to go from room_4 to room_2:
   - gotoobject purple_box_2 room_4 (to get away from any objects)
   - gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_2
   - toggle yellow_door_1

2. Then, I go to room_2:
   - gotoroom room_4 room_2 yellow_door_1

3. Then, I need to unlock green_door_1 to go from room_2 to room_1:
   - gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_1
   - toggle green_door_1

4. Then, I go to room_1:
   - gotoroom room_2 room_1 green_door_1

5. In room_1, I pick up red_box_1:
   - gotoobject red_box_1 room_1
   - pick red_box_1 room_1

6. I also need to satisfy constraint 5, which means I need to either be in room_1 (which I am now) or holding grey_ball_1 sometime after being in room_4. I'm already in room_1, so that satisfies the constraint.

7. Then, I need to unlock grey_door_1 to go from room_1 to room_3:
   - gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_3
   - toggle grey_door_1

8. Then, I go to room_3:
   - gotoroom room_1 room_3 grey_door_1

9. In room_3, I drop red_box_1 (satisfying constraint 3):
   - gotoempty
   - drop red_box_1 room_3

10. Then, I go back in front of red_box_1:
    - gotoobject red_box_1 room_3

But wait, I realized that the goal states "There is a box v such that..." which means any red box will do. Since red_box_2 is already in room_3, I can simplify the plan.

But I'm still constrained by constraint 3, which states that if I am in room_3, there must be an earlier state where I am holding red_box_1. So I still need to get red_box_1 from room_1 to room_3.

Considering this, I think the original plan is best.

Let me check if my plan satisfies all constraints:
1. yellow_door_2 remains locked throughout the plan. ✓
2. I go to room_3 in step 8. ✓
3. I hold red_box_1 in step 5, which is before being in room_3 in step 8. ✓
4. I start in room_4, so I am in room_4 at least once. ✓
5. I am in room_1 in steps 4-6, which is after being in room_4 in steps 1-2. ✓

The plan looks good! Let me translate it into the required format:

```
gotoobject purple_box_2 room_4
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_2
toggle yellow_door_1
gotoroom room_4 room_2 yellow_door_1
gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_1
toggle green_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_1 green_door_1
gotoobject red_box_1 room_1
pick red_box_1 room_1
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_3
toggle grey_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_3 grey_door_1
gotoempty
drop red_box_1 room_3
gotoobject red_box_1 room_3
```

Wait, let me double-check the preconditions and effects of each action to make sure my plan is valid:

1. **gotoobject purple_box_2 room_4**:
   - Precondition: I need to be in the same room as purple_box_2, which I am (room_4).
   - Effect: I am in front of purple_box_2.

2. **gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_2**:
   - Precondition: I need to be in a room that's connected to yellow_door_1, which I am (room_4).
   - Effect: I am in front of yellow_door_1.

3. **toggle yellow_door_1**:
   - Precondition: I need to be in front of yellow_door_1, which I am.
   - Effect: yellow_door_1 becomes unlocked.

And so on for the rest of the actions. It looks like my plan is valid.

But wait, I realized an issue with constraint 5. It says that if I am in room_4, then at that state or some later state, I must be in room_1 or holding grey_ball_1. I'm already in room_4 at the beginning, so I need to ensure this constraint is met in my plan.

In my current plan, I go to room_1 later on, which satisfies the constraint, but I want to be sure.  Actually looking back, constraint 5 is already satisfied since I go to room_1 from room_4.

One last check: is my plan optimal? Can I reduce the number of steps?

Actually, since red_box_2 is already in room_3, I could potentially just go straight to room_3 and use that box for the goal, rather than moving red_box_1 from room_1 to room_3. But, there's a complication - constraint 3 states that if I am in room_3, there must be an earlier state where I am holding red_box_1.

So either I go to room_1, grab red_box_1, go to room_3, drop red_box_1, and then use it for the goal, or I grab red_box_1, bring it to room_3, use it for the goal, and don't care about red_box_2.

To decide which is more efficient, let's count the steps:

- If I use red_box_1: I need to go to room_1, pick it up, go to room_3, drop it, and then go in front of it.
- If I use red_box_2: I need to go to room_1, pick up red_box_1, go to room_3, drop red_box_1, and then go in front of red_box_2.

Both plans seem to have a similar number of steps, so I'll stick with my original plan of using red_box_1 for the goal.

Actually, I think my original plan is optimal.

Let me think about this again: If I am in room_3, I need to have held red_box_1 earlier. If I want to satisfy the goal, I need to be in room_3 with a red box in room_3, and be in front of that red box. If I just went straight to room_3, I would satisfy the "be in room_3" constraint, but I wouldn't satisfy the constraint of having held red_box_1 earlier. If I go to room_1, pick up red_box_1, go to room_3, drop it, and then go in front of it, I satisfy both the constraint and the goal.

Actually there is a problem with my plan. Since yellow_door_2 has to remain locked, but all doors start out locked, I can't just go from room_4 to room_3 as I had originally thought. The available path is from room_4 to room_2, room_2 to room_1, and room_1 to room_3. So I need to revise my plan.

1. First, I need to unlock the yellow_door_1 to go from room_4 to room_2:
   - gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_2
   - toggle yellow_door_1

2. Then, I go to room_2:
   - gotoroom room_4 room_2 yellow_door_1

3. Then, I need to unlock green_door_1 to go from room_2 to room_1:
   - gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_1
   - toggle green_door_1

4. Then, I go to room_1:
   - gotoroom room_2 room_1 green_door_1

5. In room_1, I pick up red_box_1:
   - gotoobject red_box_1 room_1
   - pick red_box_1 room_1

6. I also need to satisfy constraint 5, which means I need to either be in room_1 (which I am now) or holding grey_ball_1 sometime after being in room_4. I'm already in room_1, so that satisfies the constraint.

7. Then, I need to unlock grey_door_1 to go from room_1 to room_3:
   - gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_3
   - toggle grey_door_1

8. Then, I go to room_3:
   - gotoroom room_1 room_3 grey_door_1

9. In room_3, I drop red_box_1 (satisfying constraint 3):
   - gotoempty
   - drop red_box_1 room_3

10. Then, I go back in front of red_box_1:
    - gotoobject red_box_1 room_3

Ah, I need to be more careful. I'm not sure if I can just do "gotodoor" immediately. I might need to first move to the door. Let me check the action descriptions again.

From the action description, "goto door" means I go in front of a door. The precondition is that I'm in a room that's connected to the door, and there's no object blocking the door. Since the initial state doesn't state any object blocking doors, I assume all doors are accessible.

So I think my plan is valid. Let me double check the actions once more:

1. **gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_2**:
   - Precondition: I need to be in a room that's connected to yellow_door_1, which I am (room_4).
   - Effect: I am in front of yellow_door_1.

2. **toggle yellow_door_1**:
   - Precondition: I need to be in front of yellow_door_1, which I am after step 1.
   - Effect: yellow_door_1 becomes unlocked.

3. **gotoroom room_4 room_2 yellow_door_1**:
   - Precondition: I need to be in a room adjacent to room_2 (which I am, room_4), and the door connecting them (yellow_door_1) must be unlocked (which it is after step 2).
   - Effect: I move from room_4 to room_2, and I'm no longer in front of yellow_door_1.

4. **gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_1**:
   - Precondition: I need to be in a room that's connected to green_door_1, which I am (room_2).
   - Effect: I am in front of green_door_1.

5. **toggle green_door_1**:
   - Precondition: I need to be in front of green_door_1, which I am after step 4.
   - Effect: green_door_1 becomes unlocked.

6. **gotoroom room_2 room_1 green_door_1**:
   - Precondition: I need to be in a room adjacent to room_1 (which I am, room_2), and the door connecting them (green_door_1) must be unlocked (which it is after step 5).
   - Effect: I move from room_2 to room_1, and I'm no longer in front of green_door_1.

7. **gotoobject red_box_1 room_1**:
   - Precondition: I need to be in the same room as red_box_1, which I am (room_1).
   - Effect: I am in front of red_box_1.

8. **pick red_box_1 room_1**:
   - Precondition: I need to be in the same room as red_box_1 (which I am, room_1), and I need to not be holding any object (which I'm not).
   - Effect: I pick up red_box_1, my hands are no longer empty, and red_box_1 is no longer in the room.

9. **gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_3**:
   - Precondition: I need to be in a room that's connected to grey_door_1, which I am (room_1).
   - Effect: I am in front of grey_door_1.

10. **toggle grey_door_1**:
    - Precondition: I need to be in front of grey_door_1, which I am after step 9.
    - Effect: grey_door_1 becomes unlocked.

11. **gotoroom room_1 room_3 grey_door_1**:
    - Precondition: I need to be in a room adjacent to room_3 (which I am, room_1), and the door connecting them (grey_door_1) must be unlocked (which it is after step 10).
    - Effect: I move from room_1 to room_3, and I'm no longer in front of grey_door_1.

12. **gotoempty**:
    - Precondition: None.
    - Effect: I am in front of an empty position.

13. **drop red_box_1 room_3**:
    - Precondition: I need to be holding red_box_1 (which I am), and the position in front of me needs to be empty (which it is after step 12).
    - Effect: I drop red_box_1, my hands are empty, and red_box_1 is now in room_3.

14. **gotoobject red_box_1 room_3**:
    - Precondition: I need to be in the same room as red_box_1, which I am (room_3).
    - Effect: I am in front of red_box_1.

The plan seems valid, and it achieves the goal of being in room_3, in front of a red box, with empty hands. It also respects all the constraints.

The goal is "There is a box v such that "The following conditions are all true: "v is red", "you are in room_3", "v is in room_3", "you are not holding any object", "you are in front of v"""

At the end of my plan:
- I am in room_3.
- red_box_1 is in room_3.
- red_box_1 is red.
- I am not holding any object.
- I am in front of red_box_1.

So the goal is achieved.

And the constraints are respected:
1. yellow_door_2 remains locked throughout.
2. I am in room_3 in steps 11-14.
3. I hold red_box_1 in steps 8-12, which is before being in room_3 in step 11.
4. I start in room_4, so I am in room_4 in the initial state.
5. I am in room_1 in steps 6-10, which is after being in room_4 in the initial state.

My plan is:

```
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_2
toggle yellow_door_1
gotoroom room_4 room_2 yellow_door_1
gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_1
toggle green_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_1 green_door_1
gotoobject red_box_1 room_1
pick red_box_1 room_1
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_3
toggle grey_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_3 grey_door_1
gotoempty
drop red_box_1 room_3
gotoobject red_box_1 room_3
```

This plan should achieve the goal while respecting all constraints.

Let me double check it once more to be careful:

1. Starting in room_4, I go to the door connecting room_4 and room_2 (yellow_door_1).
2. I toggle yellow_door_1 to unlock it.
3. I go to room_2.
4. I go to the door connecting room_2 and room_1 (green_door_1).
5. I toggle green_door_1 to unlock it.
6. I go to room_1.
7. I go to red_box_1 in room_1.
8. I pick up red_box_1.
9. I go to the door connecting room_1 and room_3 (grey_door_1).
10. I toggle grey_door_1 to unlock it.
11. I go to room_3.
12. I go to an empty position.
13. I drop red_box_1 in room_3.
14. I go back to red_box_1 in room_3.

At the end, I am in room_3, in front of red_box_1, with empty hands, and red_box_1 is in room_3. All constraints are satisfied. So this is a valid plan. And it's a plan with 14 steps, which is reasonable.

Is there any way to make the plan more optimal? Let's see:

- I need to pick up red_box_1 in room_1, which means I need to go to room_1.
- From room_4, the shortest path to room_1 is through room_2.
- After getting to room_1 and picking up red_box_1, I need to go to room_3 to drop it.
- The direct path from room_1 to room_3 is through grey_door_1.

So my plan follows the shortest path, and I doubt there's a more optimal plan.

Let me double check the goal again to be certain. The goal is: "There is a box v such that "The following conditions are all true: "v is red", "you are in room_3", "v is in room_3", "you are not holding any object", "you are in front of v""".

This means there needs to be a red box in room_3, and I need to be in room_3, in front of that red box, with empty hands.

There's already red_box_2 in room_3 in the initial state. Could I simplify my plan by just going to room_3 and standing in front of red_box_2?

But, there's a constraint that says: "If expression 'you are in room_3' holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: 'you are holding red_box_1'".

So, I need to hold red_box_1 before being in room_3. If I go straight to room_3, I violate this constraint. Therefore, I need to go to room_1, pick up red_box_1, and then go to room_3.

Once I'm in room_3, I have two options:
1. Drop red_box_1 and stand in front of it.
2. Drop red_box_1 and stand in front of red_box_2, which is already in room_3.

Both options would satisfy the goal. The difference is whether I go to an empty position, drop red_box_1, and then go back to red_box_1, or go directly to red_box_2 after dropping red_box_1.

Let me count the steps for both options:

Using red_box_1:
1. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_2
2. toggle yellow_door_1
3. gotoroom room_4 room_2 yellow_door_1
4. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_1
5. toggle green_door_1
6. gotoroom room_2 room_1 green_door_1
7. gotoobject red_box_1 room_1
8. pick red_box_1 room_1
9. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_3
10. toggle grey_door_1
11. gotoroom room_1 room_3 grey_door_1
12. gotoempty
13. drop red_box_1 room_3
14. gotoobject red_box_1 room_3

Using red_box_2:
1. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_2
2. toggle yellow_door_1
3. gotoroom room_4 room_2 yellow_door_1
4. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_1
5. toggle green_door_1
6. gotoroom room_2 room_1 green_door_1
7. gotoobject red_box_1 room_1
8. pick red_box_1 room_1
9. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_3
10. toggle grey_door_1
11. gotoroom room_1 room_3 grey_door_1
12. gotoobject red_box_2 room_3 (not sure if I can go straight to red_box_2 if I'm holding something, but let's assume)
13. drop red_box_1 room_3
14. gotoobject red_box_2 room_3

Both plans have 14 steps, so they are equally optimal. Let's go with the first option, which is simpler.

So, my final plan is:

```
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_2
toggle yellow_door_1
gotoroom room_4 room_2 yellow_door_1
gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_1
toggle green_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_1 green_door_1
gotoobject red_box_1 room_1
pick red_box_1 room_1
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_3
toggle grey_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_3 grey_door_1
gotoempty
drop red_box_1 room_3
gotoobject red_box_1 room_3
```

This plan should achieve the goal while respecting all constraints. And the plan is optimal because there isn't another plan that would solve the problem in fewer steps.

Actually, I'm a bit concerned with the second option using red_box_2. Let's dig into step 12 and 13 a bit more.

12. gotoobject red_box_2 room_3: I'm going to red_box_2 while holding red_box_1. Is this allowed?
13. drop red_box_1 room_3: I'm dropping red_box_1 in front of red_box_2. Is this allowed?

From the action descriptions, "drop" can only be performed if "the position in front of you is empty". If I'm in front of red_box_2, then the position isn't empty, and I can't drop red_box_1 there.

So, the second option isn't feasible, and I need to go with the first option (which is the plan I already laid out).

These are the steps:

```
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_2
toggle yellow_door_1
gotoroom room_4 room_2 yellow_door_1
gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_1
toggle green_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_1 green_door_1
gotoobject red_box_1 room_1
pick red_box_1 room_1
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_3
toggle grey_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_3 grey_door_1
gotoempty
drop red_box_1 room_3
gotoobject red_box_1 room_3
```

Given all the constraints and the goal, this is the optimal plan.
