Okay, let's tackle this planning problem step by step. The goal is to get a red box into room_3, be in front of it, not holding anything, and meet all the constraints. Let's break down the initial state, the goal, and the constraints first.

Starting in room_4. The red boxes are red_box_1 in room_1 and red_box_2 in room_3. The goal requires a red box in room_3, but red_box_2 is already there. Wait, but the goal says "there is a box v such that v is red, you are in room_3, v is in room_3, etc." So maybe red_box_2 already satisfies part of the goal. Wait, but maybe the problem is that the agent needs to be in front of v (the red box in room_3). But red_box_2 is already in room_3. So perhaps the solution is simply to go to room_3, go to red_box_2, and drop nothing. Wait, but the initial state says you're in room_4. So the agent needs to move to room_3, but all doors are locked. Let's check the doors:

Doors are green_door_1 (connects room_1 and 2), grey_door_1 (connects room_1 and 3), yellow_door_1 (room_2 and 4), yellow_door_2 (room_3 and 4). All doors are locked initially. But the constraint says that yellow_door_2 must stay locked in every state. So we can't unlock yellow_door_2 to go between room_3 and 4. That complicates things because the agent starts in room_4. To get to room_3, normally you could use yellow_door_2, but since it must always be locked, that's not possible. So alternative path: from room_4, the agent can go to room_2 via yellow_door_1 (but it's locked), then room_2 to room_1 via green_door_1 (also locked), then room_1 to room_3 via grey_door_1 (locked). So the agent needs to unlock some doors. But which ones can be toggled?

Wait, the toggle action can unlock a door if you are in front of it. But to get in front of a door, you need to be in a room connected by that door and no object is blocking it. Let's check the doors:

To get to room_3 from room_4: yellow_door_2 is locked and must stay locked. So can't use that. So the agent needs another path. Let's see possible routes:

From room_4, can go to room_2 via yellow_door_1 if unlocked. Then from room_2 to room_1 via green_door_1 if unlocked, then from room_1 to room_3 via grey_door_1 if unlocked. Then room_3 to room_1, etc. But all doors are locked initially.

So the agent needs to unlock doors. But to unlock a door, they need to be in front of it. To get in front of a door, they need to be in a room connected by that door and no object is blocking the position in front of the door.

Looking at the initial positions:

In room_4, the objects are purple_box_2 and blue_ball_1. The doors connected to room_4 are yellow_door_1 (room_2 and 4) and yellow_door_2 (room_3 and 4). But since yellow_door_2 must remain locked, the agent can't use that. So the only exit from room_4 is yellow_door_1 to room_2, but it's locked. So to unlock yellow_door_1, the agent needs to go in front of it. But is there an object blocking in front of yellow_door_1 in room_4? The problem states that "the position in front of d in the room you are currently in" must not be blocked. The objects in room_4 are purple_box_2 and blue_ball_1. Are they blocking the door? The problem doesn't mention any objects blocking doors initially. Wait, the initial state doesn't say any objects are blocking doors. So maybe all doors are unblocked. So the agent can go to the door.

So steps:

1. In room_4, go to yellow_door_1 (which connects room_4 and 2). Since in room_4, gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_2. Precondition: in a room connected by the door (yes, room_4 and 2 via yellow_door_1). No object blocking. So action: gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_2. Then toggle yellow_door_1 to unlock it. Then goto room_4 to room_2 via yellow_door_1.

But wait, the agent is in room_4. To go to room_2, need to use yellow_door_1. So:

- gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_2
- toggle yellow_door_1 (unlocks it)
- gotoroom room_4 room_2 yellow_door_1

Once in room_2, then need to go to room_1 via green_door_1, but green_door_1 is locked. So:

- gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_1
- toggle green_door_1 (unlock)
- gotoroom room_2 room_1 green_door_1

Now in room_1. In room_1, there are red_box_1, grey_ball_1, purple_box_1. Then need to go to room_3 via grey_door_1. But grey_door_1 is locked.

So:

- gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_3
- toggle grey_door_1 (unlock)
- gotoroom room_1 room_3 grey_door_1

Now in room_3. But the goal requires the agent to be in room_3, in front of a red box. The red_box_2 is already in room_3. So the agent can just go to red_box_2 in room_3 and be in front of it. But wait, the goal says "you are in front of v" where v is the red box in room_3, and you are not holding anything. So maybe the steps are:

Once in room_3:

- gotoobject red_box_2 room_3 (since agent is in room_3, preconditions met)
- then the goal is achieved.

But wait, the constraints:

Constraints:

1. yellow_door_2 must stay locked in every state. So if the agent ever toggles it, that's a problem. But in the initial state, it's locked, and the constraint is that it must remain locked in all states. So the plan must not toggle yellow_door_2.

2. The agent must be in room_3 in at least one state (which the final state will satisfy).

3. If the agent is in room_3 in some state, there must be an earlier state where they were holding red_box_1. Wait, but in this case, the agent is using red_box_2, which is already in room_3. So the constraint is that whenever the agent is in room_3, they must have held red_box_1 before. But if the agent's plan is to go to room_3 without ever holding red_box_1, that would violate the constraint. So this complicates things.

Ah, the third constraint says that if the agent is in room_3 at any state, there must be a prior state where they were holding red_box_1. So even if the agent uses red_box_2 in the goal, they still need to have held red_box_1 before entering room_3. So the plan must include picking up red_box_1 at some point before entering room_3.

But red_box_1 is in room_1. So the agent needs to go to room_1, pick up red_box_1, then proceed to room_3. But then they need to drop it somewhere, or carry it. But the goal requires that the agent is not holding any object. So perhaps the agent picks up red_box_1 in room_1, then moves to room_3, drops it there, but that would leave a red box in room_3, but there's already red_box_2. Wait, but the goal just requires that there exists a red box in room_3, which is already satisfied by red_box_2. So why would the agent need to move red_box_1 there? Because the constraint requires that whenever the agent is in room_3, they must have held red_box_1 before. So even if the agent uses red_box_2, they still need to have held red_box_1 previously.

So the agent must pick up red_box_1 in room_1, then proceed to room_3. But since the agent needs to drop it somewhere, perhaps they can carry it to room_3 and drop it there. But that's redundant since there's already a red box. Alternatively, they can pick it up and then drop it again in room_1. But that would satisfy the constraint, as long as they held red_box_1 before entering room_3.

So the plan needs to include:

1. Go to room_1.
2. Pick up red_box_1.
3. Drop it (maybe immediately, but then you need to be in front of an empty spot to drop).
4. Then proceed to room_3.

But how to get to room_1:

From room_4, go to room_2 via yellow_door_1 (after unlocking), then to room_1 via green_door_1 (after unlocking). Then in room_1, pick up red_box_1. Then drop it, then proceed to room_3 via grey_door_1 (unlocking it), then in room_3, go to red_box_2.

But the goal requires the agent to be in front of a red box in room_3, which is red_box_2. So the steps would be:

- Unlock yellow_door_1 (room4 to room2)
- Go to room2
- Unlock green_door_1 (room2 to room1)
- Go to room1
- Pick red_box_1 (satisfy the constraint that when in room3, had held red_box_1 before)
- Drop red_box_1 (maybe in room1)
- Then unlock grey_door_1 (room1 to room3)
- Go to room3
- Goto red_box_2 in room3
- Now, the agent is in room3, in front of red_box_2, not holding anything. This meets the goal.

But let's check the constraints:

- The yellow_door_2 must stay locked. The agent never toggles it, so that's okay.
- The agent is in room3 in the final state, so that's covered.
- The agent was in room3 only in the final state, and before that, they held red_box_1. So that satisfies the constraint.
- The agent must be in room4 at least once. The initial state is room4, but the constraint says "in at least one state", which the initial state counts. So that's okay.
- The fourth constraint: if the agent is in room4 in some state s, then in s or after, they must be in room1 or holding grey_ball_1. The agent starts in room4. So after the initial state, when they leave room4, they need to ensure that either in the initial state (room4) or after, they are in room1 or holding grey_ball_1. But in the initial state, they are in room4, so the condition must hold at s (room4) or after. Since the agent leaves room4 immediately, they need to satisfy that after leaving, in some state after s (room4), they are in room1 or holding grey_ball_1. The agent will go to room1 later, so that's covered. So when they are in room4 (the initial state), the condition must hold at s or after. The agent in the initial state is in room4. So at s (the initial state), they are in room4, but the condition is that in s or after, they must be in room1 or holding grey_ball_1. Since after leaving room4, they go to room2, then room1, which satisfies the "in room1" part. So that's okay.

Now, let's outline the steps:

1. Start in room4.

First, need to unlock yellow_door_1 to get to room2.

Action: gotodoor yellow_door_1 room4 room2 (pre: in room4, door connects to room2, no blocking objects)
Effect: in front of yellow_door_1.

Action: toggle yellow_door_1 (unlocks it)

Action: gotoroom room4 room2 yellow_door_1 (now in room2)

Then unlock green_door_1 to get to room1.

In room2:

Action: gotodoor green_door_1 room2 room1 (pre: in room2, door connects to room1)
Action: toggle green_door_1 (unlock)
Action: gotoroom room2 room1 green_door_1 (now in room1)

In room1, need to pick up red_box_1.

Action: gotoobject red_box_1 room1 (pre: in room1)
Action: pick red_box_1 room1 (pre: not holding anything)
Now holding red_box_1.

But to satisfy the constraint, after picking red_box_1, the agent can drop it somewhere. But maybe just picking it up is enough, as the constraint is that when entering room3, there was a prior state holding red_box_1. So perhaps after picking it up, the agent can drop it, but that's optional. However, the agent can't carry it to room3 because the goal requires not holding anything. So steps after picking:

Action: drop red_box_1 room1. But to drop, need to be in front of an empty position. So after picking, the agent is no longer in front of red_box_1. So they need to gotoempty first.

Wait, after picking, the effects are: no longer in front of x, hands not empty, carrying x, x removed from room. So after picking red_box_1, the agent is carrying it, not in front of anything. To drop, they need to be in front of an empty spot. So:

After picking, do:

Action: gotoempty (moves to empty spot)
Action: drop red_box_1 room1 (drops it)

But is dropping necessary? The constraint is that when the agent is in room3, they must have held red_box_1 before. So even if they just pick it up and carry it to room3, then drop it there, that's okay. But then the agent would have to carry it through doors. Let's see.

Alternative plan:

Pick red_box_1 in room1, then carry it to room3. Then drop it in room3, but since red_box_2 is already there, maybe that's okay. But the goal requires the agent to be in front of a red box in room3. If they drop red_box_1 in room3, they can be in front of it. But the goal just requires that there exists such a box. However, the initial problem's goal is "There is a box v such that...", so either red_box_1 or red_box_2 would work. But in the initial state, red_box_2 is already in room3. So perhaps the agent doesn't need to move red_box_1. But the constraint requires that when the agent is in room3, they have held red_box_1 before. So even if the agent uses red_box_2, they must have held red_box_1 earlier.

So the simplest way is to pick red_box_1 in room1, then drop it (maybe back in room1), then proceed to room3. Then, in room3, go to red_box_2.

So steps after arriving in room1:

1. gotoobject red_box_1 room1
2. pick red_box_1 room1
3. gotoempty room1
4. drop red_box_1 room1
5. Then unlock grey_door_1 to go to room3.

But then, after dropping, red_box_1 is back in room1, but the constraint is satisfied because the agent held it before going to room3.

So proceeding:

In room1:

Action: gotoobject red_box_1 room1
Action: pick red_box_1 room1
Action: gotoempty
Action: drop red_box_1 room1

Then proceed to unlock grey_door_1.

Action: gotodoor grey_door_1 room1 room3
Action: toggle grey_door_1 (unlock)
Action: gotoroom room1 room3 grey_door_1 (now in room3)

Then in room3, go to red_box_2:

Action: gotoobject red_box_2 room3

Now, the agent is in room3, in front of red_box_2, not holding anything. That meets the goal.

Now, check all constraints:

- yellow_door_2 remains locked: yes, never touched.
- Agent is in room3: yes.
- Agent held red_box_1 before entering room3: yes, picked it in room1.
- Agent was in room4: initial state counts.
- After leaving room4, agent eventually goes to room1, satisfying the fourth constraint.

But wait, the fourth constraint says that if the agent is in room4 in some state s, then in s or after, they must be in room1 or holding grey_ball_1. Since the agent starts in room4 (state s0), then after s0, they move to room2, then room1. So after s0, they are in room1, which satisfies the condition.

So the plan is:

1. In room4, go to yellow_door_1 (room4 to room2)
2. Toggle (unlock) yellow_door_1
3. Go to room2
4. Go to green_door_1 (room2 to room1)
5. Toggle (unlock) green_door_1
6. Go to room1
7. Go to red_box_1 in room1
8. Pick red_box_1
9. Go to empty spot
10. Drop red_box_1
11. Go to grey_door_1 (room1 to room3)
12. Toggle (unlock) grey_door_1
13. Go to room3
14. Go to red_box_2 in room3

But steps 9 and 10 (drop) may not be necessary if the agent can carry red_box_1 to room3. Let's see:

Alternative plan after picking red_box_1 in room1:

- Then go to grey_door_1 (room1 to room3)
- Toggle grey_door_1 (unlock)
- Go to room3 (carrying red_box_1)
- Drop red_box_1 in room3 (needs to be in front of empty spot)
- Then go to red_box_2.

But this way, the agent is holding red_box_1 when entering room3. So the constraint is satisfied because they held red_box_1 before entering room3. Then they can drop it in room3, but the goal requires the agent to be in front of a red box in room3. If they drop red_box_1 in room3, they can be in front of it. However, the problem states the goal as "there is a box v... in room3", which can be either red_box_1 or red_box_2. But since red_box_2 is already there, maybe it's easier to use that. But the agent still needs to have held red_box_1 before entering room3. So in either case, the steps are similar.

But perhaps the shorter plan is to pick red_box_1, carry it to room3, drop it there, then go to red_box_2. But that's longer. Alternatively, pick red_box_1, drop in room1, then proceed.

But let's count the steps. Which plan is shorter?

Option 1: pick, drop in room1, then proceed to room3. Steps:

gotoobject red_box_1, pick, gotoempty, drop: 4 actions.

Then unlock grey_door_1: gotodoor, toggle, gotoroom: 3 actions.

Then gotoobject red_box_2: 1 action. Total: 4+3+1=8 actions for this part.

Option 2: pick red_box_1, carry to room3, drop there, then goto red_box_2.

After picking red_box_1 in room1:

goto door grey_door_1: 1 action.

toggle: 1.

gotoroom: 1.

Now in room3, holding red_box_1.

gotoempty: 1.

drop: 1.

then gotoobject red_box_2: 1.

Total: 1+1+1+1+1+1=6 actions from pick to finish.

So option 2 is shorter. So the plan would be:

1. From room4:

gotodoor yellow_door_1 room4 room2
toggle yellow_door_1
gotoroom room4 room2 yellow_door_1

2. In room2:

gotodoor green_door_1 room2 room1
toggle green_door_1
gotoroom room2 room1 green_door_1

3. In room1:

gotoobject red_box_1 room1
pick red_box_1 room1

4. Now holding red_box_1, go to grey_door_1:

gotodoor grey_door_1 room1 room3
toggle grey_door_1
gotoroom room1 room3 grey_door_1

5. In room3:

gotoempty
drop red_box_1 room3
gotoobject red_box_2 room3

But wait, after dropping red_box_1 in room3, the agent is in front of it. Then they need to go to red_box_2. So steps:

drop red_box_1 in room3 (now in front of it), then gotoobject red_box_2. But the agent is in room3, so that's possible.

But the goal requires the agent to be in front of a red box in room3. So if they drop red_box_1, they can just stay in front of it. But then they need to be not holding anything, which they are after dropping. So maybe the final steps can be:

After dropping red_box_1, the agent is in front of it, so that's already meeting the goal. However, the problem's goal says "you are in front of v" where v is the red box in room3. If the agent drops red_box_1 in room3 and is in front of it, that satisfies the goal. So perhaps the final steps can be shorter.

Wait, after dropping, the agent is in front of red_box_1, which is in room3. So the final state would have the agent in room3, in front of red_box_1, not holding anything. That meets the goal. So steps:

After entering room3 while carrying red_box_1:

Action: gotoempty (to find a spot to drop)
Action: drop red_box_1 room3 (now in front of it)

So the final state is in room3, in front of red_box_1. So that's acceptable. But red_box_2 is also in room3, but that's okay. The goal just requires existence.

But does the problem's goal specify that the agent must be in front of a red box that is in room3, which could be either. So this plan would work.

But let's count the steps:

1. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room4 room2
2. toggle yellow_door_1
3. gotoroom room4 room2 yellow_door_1
4. gotodoor green_door_1 room2 room1
5. toggle green_door_1
6. gotoroom room2 room1 green_door_1
7. gotoobject red_box_1 room1
8. pick red_box_1 room1
9. gotodoor grey_door_1 room1 room3
10. toggle grey_door_1
11. gotoroom room1 room3 grey_door_1
12. gotoempty
13. drop red_box_1 room3

That's 13 steps. But maybe there's a way to optimize. For example, after step 8 (pick red_box_1), can the agent go directly to the door without needing to gotoempty first? Because after picking, the agent is no longer in front of any object. So to go to the door, they can use gotodoor grey_door_1 room1 room3. The preconditions for gotodoor: in a room connected by the door (yes, room1), and no object blocking. So yes.

So steps after picking red_box_1:

9. gotodoor grey_door_1 room1 room3
10. toggle grey_door_1
11. gotoroom room1 room3 grey_door_1
12. drop red_box_1 room3 (but can't drop unless in front of empty spot)

Wait, the drop action requires being in front of an empty spot. After entering room3, the agent is no longer in front of anything (effect of gotoroom is to leave front of any object/door). So when the agent arrives in room3, they are not in front of anything. So to drop, they need to be in front of an empty spot. But the drop action's precondition is (i) holding x, (ii) position in front is empty. Wait, the drop action's preconditions are: you may drop x if you are holding x and the position in front of you is empty. Wait, no: the drop action's precondition is (i) holding x, (ii) the position in front is empty. Wait, but according to the problem statement, the preconditions for drop are:

"drop": you may only drop x if (i) you are holding x, and (ii) the position in front of you is empty.

So when the agent arrives in room3 after gotoroom, they are not in front of anything. So the position in front is empty? Or does the agent need to be in front of an empty spot to drop?

Wait, the drop action's effect is that after dropping, you are in front of x, which is now in the room. So the preconditions for drop are that you are holding x and the position in front is empty. So when the agent is in room3, after arriving, they are not in front of anything. So their current position is not in front of any object or door. So to drop, they need to be in a position where the spot they are dropping into is empty. But how do they ensure that? They need to be in front of an empty spot. So they have to perform gotoempty to move to an empty spot, then drop.

So after arriving in room3:

12. gotoempty (room3)
13. drop red_box_1 room3

Now, they are in front of red_box_1 in room3. So that satisfies the goal.

Alternatively, if there's an empty spot in room3, they can gotoempty and drop. So the plan steps are as before.

But this makes the plan 13 actions. Can it be shortened?

Alternatively, after arriving in room3, the agent can drop red_box_1 immediately if the position they are in is considered empty. But according to the problem's action effects, after gotoroom, the agent is no longer in front of any object or door. So when they arrive in room3, they are not in front of anything. So their current position is empty? Not necessarily; the gotoempty action moves them to an empty spot. The agent's position after gotoroom is unspecified except that they are no longer in front of any object or door. So to drop, they need to be in front of an empty spot. Therefore, they must perform gotoempty to ensure they are in front of an empty spot before dropping.

So steps 12 and 13 are necessary.

But is there a way to avoid this? For example, when the agent is in room3, maybe they can directly drop if their current position is considered empty. But according to the problem's description, the "gotoempty" action moves them to an empty position. So if they are not in front of anything after gotoroom, maybe they are already in front of an empty spot. Wait, the problem says:

The effect of "gotoroom" is (iv) if you were in front of some object or door x0, then you are no longer in front of x0. But it doesn't say you are in front of something else. So after gotoroom, the agent is in room3 but not in front of any object or door. So their position is empty, so they can drop.

Wait, the "drop" action requires that the position in front is empty. If after gotoroom, the agent is not in front of any object or door, does that mean the position is empty? Or is the agent's position considered to be in front of an empty spot? The problem's description is a bit ambiguous here.

Looking back at the effects of "gotoroom":

(iv) if you were in front of some object or door x0, then you are no longer in front of x0.

So after gotoroom, the agent is in room3, and no longer in front of any x0. So their current position is not in front of anything. So can they drop without using gotoempty? The preconditions for drop are (i) holding x, (ii) position in front is empty. If the agent is not in front of any object or door, then the position is empty. So yes, they can drop immediately.

So after arriving in room3 (step 11), the agent is holding red_box_1, and is not in front of any object or door. So the position in front is empty. Therefore, they can perform "drop red_box_1 room3" immediately. So step 12 would be drop, saving the gotoempty step.

That would shorten the plan. So the revised steps would be:

1. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room4 room2
2. toggle yellow_door_1
3. gotoroom room4 room2 yellow_door_1
4. gotodoor green_door_1 room2 room1
5. toggle green_door_1
6. gotoroom room2 room1 green_door_1
7. gotoobject red_box_1 room1
8. pick red_box_1 room1
9. gotodoor grey_door_1 room1 room3
10. toggle grey_door_1
11. gotoroom room1 room3 grey_door_1
12. drop red_box_1 room3

Now, after step 11, the agent is in room3, not in front of anything, holding red_box_1. So they can drop it immediately because the position in front is empty (since they are not in front of any object or door). So step 12 is valid.

Then the agent is in front of red_box_1 in room3, not holding anything. This meets the goal.

This plan is 12 steps. Now check all constraints again:

- yellow_door_2 remains locked: yes.
- Agent is in room3: yes.
- Agent held red_box_1 before entering room3: yes, steps 7-8.
- Agent was in room4: initial state.
- After leaving room4, agent eventually goes to room1, which satisfies the fourth constraint.

Thus, this plan is valid and shorter.

Another thing to check: when the agent drops red_box_1 in room3, does that block any doors? The problem states that when an object is dropped, it's placed in the current room. But if the position in front of a door is blocked by an object, then gotodoor actions would fail. However, in this plan, after dropping red_box_1 in room3, the agent is in front of it, but there's no indication that it's blocking a door. Since the agent doesn't need to use any doors in room3 after dropping, this should be fine.

Another possible optimization: after step 8 (pick red_box_1), can the agent go directly to the door without using gotodoor? For example, after picking, the agent is not in front of any object. To go to the door, they need to use gotodoor.

Yes, because to perform gotodoor, they must be in the same room as the door. Since grey_door_1 is in room1, they can perform gotodoor grey_door_1 room1 room3. So steps 9-10-11-12 are correct.

Thus, the final plan is 12 steps.
