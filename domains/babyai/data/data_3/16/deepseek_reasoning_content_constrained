Okay, let's tackle this planning problem step by step. The goal is to end up in front of a red door connecting room_3 and room_4 (which would be red_door_2) that's unlocked. Plus, there are some constraints to satisfy.

First, the initial state: I'm in room_2, and all doors are locked. The doors are grey_door_1 (connects room_1 and 2), green_door_1 (room_1 and 3), red_door_1 (room_2 and 4), and red_door_2 (room_3 and 4). All are locked. The final goal needs me to be in front of a red door connecting room_3 and room_4 (red_door_2), which must be unlocked. Also, the constraints are:

1. Must be in room_4 at least once.
2. If I'm in room_4, I must have held blue_box_1 before.
3. red_ball_1 must be in room_4 at some point.
4. red_door_1 must always stay locked.

So, let's break this down. To get to room_4, but red_door_1 is always locked, so I can't use that. The other way is via room_3 and red_door_2. But red_door_2 is locked initially, so I need to unlock it. But to unlock it, I need to toggle it, which requires being in front of it. So I need to get to red_door_2, which is in room_3 and room_4. But starting in room_2, how to get there?

Path: room_2 -> room_1 via grey_door_1? But grey_door_1 is locked. To unlock it, I need to be in front of it. Since I'm in room_2, I can go to grey_door_1 (if not blocked). Wait, but to go to a door, the preconditions are: I'm in a room connected by the door, and the position in front of the door in my current room isn't blocked.

Check initial objects in rooms. In room_2, green_box_1 is present. If the door's front is blocked by an object, I can't go there. So, is grey_door_1 in room_2 blocked? The initial objects in room_2 are green_box_1. But the door's position might not be blocked. So assuming that the doors' positions are not blocked unless an object is placed there. Since green_box_1 is in room_2, but not specified to be in front of the door. So maybe I can go to the door.

So steps:

1. From room_2, goto grey_door_1 (connecting room_2 and 1). But door is locked. Need to toggle it. So first, goto the door, then toggle to unlock. Then go to room_1.

Wait, but "gotodoor d r1 r2" requires being in a room connected by d, and no object blocking the position. Since room_2 is connected via grey_door_1 to room_1, I can go to the door. Then toggle it to unlock. Then go to room_1.

But after that, from room_1, perhaps go to room_3 via green_door_1. But green_door_1 is locked. Need to unlock that as well. So similar steps: goto green_door_1 in room_1, toggle to unlock, then go to room_3. Then in room_3, go to red_door_2 (connecting to room_4), unlock it, then go to room_4. But need to fulfill the constraint that when in room_4, I must have held blue_box_1 before. Blue_box_1 is in room_1. So I need to pick it up at some point.

Additionally, red_ball_1 must be in room_4. red_ball_1 is initially in room_3. So I need to move it to room_4. But to do that, I need to pick it up in room_3 and drop it in room_4.

But how do I carry both blue_box_1 and red_ball_1? Since I can only hold one object at a time. So I need to make multiple trips or find a way to combine steps.

Let's outline possible steps:

1. From room_2, go to grey_door_1 (room_2 and room_1), toggle to unlock. Then go to room_1.
2. In room_1, pick up blue_box_1 (since it's there). Then maybe drop it somewhere, but why? Wait, the constraint says that if I'm in room_4, I must have held blue_box_1 in an earlier state. So once I pick it up and then drop it, that's okay as long as before entering room_4, I have held it.

But how to get to room_4. Let's see:

After step 1: I'm in room_1. Then, to get to room_3, need to go through green_door_1, which is locked. So in room_1, go to green_door_1, toggle to unlock. Then go to room_3.

In room_3, there's red_ball_1 and red_ball_2. Need to pick up red_ball_1 and take it to room_4. But to get to room_4, need to go through red_door_2, which is locked. So first, in room_3, go to red_door_2 (connecting to room_4), toggle it to unlock. Then go to room_4. But when I go to room_4, I need to have held blue_box_1 before. So before entering room_4, I must have picked up blue_box_1.

Wait, but blue_box_1 is in room_1. So steps:

After unlocking grey_door_1 and going to room_1:

Pick up blue_box_1 (if possible). Preconditions for pick: same room, not holding anything. So yes. So:

Action: pick blue_box_1 room_1. Now holding it.

Then, maybe drop it somewhere else. But why? Because we need to carry other items? Wait, but the constraint is that if you are in room_4, you must have held blue_box_1 before. So once you've picked it up, even if you drop it later, that's okay. So perhaps:

After picking blue_box_1 in room_1, you can drop it, then proceed. But maybe you need to carry it to room_4? No, the constraint is just that you held it before entering room_4. So even if you pick it up and drop it in room_1, then later go to room_4, that's acceptable.

But let's see. The steps could be:

In room_2:

1. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_1 (assuming that's allowed if no object is blocking the door in room_2). Then toggle grey_door_1 to unlock it. Then gotoroom room_2 room_1 grey_door_1.

Now in room_1.

2. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1. Then pick blue_box_1. Now holding it.

3. Then drop it in room_1 (maybe not necessary, but to free hands). Or proceed while holding it. Wait, but if I need to pick up other objects, I need to drop it. But perhaps I can drop it in room_1 and proceed.

But the plan requires that when in room_4, there's an earlier state where I held blue_box_1. So even if I pick and drop in room_1, that's okay.

So after picking blue_box_1 and dropping it, then proceed to unlock green_door_1.

But to unlock green_door_1, need to be in front of it in room_1. So:

4. gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3. Toggle to unlock. Then gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1.

Now in room_3. Here, red_ball_1 is present. Need to take it to room_4.

But to get to room_4, need to unlock red_door_2. So:

5. In room_3, gotodoor red_door_2 room_3 room_4. Toggle to unlock. Then gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_2.

But wait, when I go to room_4, I need to have held blue_box_1 before. Since I did that in step 2, that's satisfied.

Now, once in room_4, I can drop red_ball_1 there. But wait, I need to carry red_ball_1 from room_3 to room_4. So in room_3, before going to room_4, I need to pick red_ball_1.

So steps in room_3:

After step 4, I'm in room_3. So:

5. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_3. Pick red_ball_1. Now holding it.

6. Then, gotodoor red_door_2 room_3 room_4. Toggle it (but it's initially locked). So first, gotodoor red_door_2, toggle to unlock. Then gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_2.

Wait, but after toggling, the door is unlocked. Then go to room_4. Then drop red_ball_1 there. That satisfies the red_ball_1 in room_4.

But wait, the initial state of red_door_2 is locked, so in room_3, when I go to red_door_2, I can toggle it to unlock.

So let's adjust:

After step 4 (in room_3):

5. gotodoor red_door_2 room_3 room_4. Toggle red_door_2 (unlocking it). Now, the door is unlocked.

6. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_3. Pick red_ball_1.

7. gotodoor red_door_2 room_3 room_4. Then gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_2.

Now in room_4. Drop red_ball_1 here (since drop requires being in front of an empty spot. But maybe after entering room_4, I need to gotoempty, then drop.

Wait, when you goto a room, you are no longer in front of any object. So after entering room_4, I'm in the room but not in front of anything. So to drop red_ball_1, need to be in front of an empty spot. So:

8. gotoempty in room_4. Then drop red_ball_1. Now it's in room_4.

Now, the goal requires being in front of the red door (red_door_2) which is now unlocked. So after dropping the ball, need to go back to red_door_2. But red_door_2 is in room_4 and room_3. So in room_4, gotodoor red_door_2 room_4 room_3. Then I'm in front of it. And since it's unlocked, that's the goal.

But let's check all steps for constraints:

- Must be in room_4 at least once: achieved when we go there.

- When in room_4, must have held blue_box_1 before: yes, step 2.

- red_ball_1 in room_4: achieved by dropping it there.

- red_door_1 remains locked: since we never toggled it, it stays locked. So all constraints are met.

But wait, the plan needs to end with being in front of the red door (d) which is red, connects room_3 and 4, and is unlocked. So the final steps after dropping the ball would be:

In room_4, go to red_door_2 (which connects room_4 and 3). So gotodoor red_door_2 room_4 room_3. Then check if it's unlocked. Since we toggled it in step 5, it's unlocked. So now, the agent is in front of red_door_2 in room_4. The door is red, connects room_3 and 4, and is unlocked. That satisfies the goal.

Putting it all together:

Let's outline the steps:

1. From room_2, go to grey_door_1 (room_2 to room_1). Preconditions: in room_2, door connects room_2 and 1. So:

Action: gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_1

2. Toggle grey_door_1 to unlock.

Action: toggle grey_door_1

3. Go to room_1.

Action: gotoroom room_2 room_1 grey_door_1

4. Go to blue_box_1 in room_1.

Action: gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1

5. Pick blue_box_1.

Action: pick blue_box_1 room_1

6. Drop blue_box_1 (optional? No, the constraint is just to have held it before entering room_4. So maybe we can drop it here or later. But to proceed, perhaps we need to drop it to have free hands for unlocking other doors. Let's drop it.

Action: drop blue_box_1 room_1. Wait, but to drop, need to be in front of an empty position. So after picking, the agent is no longer in front of blue_box_1. So need to gotoempty first.

Wait, after picking, the agent is not in front of anything. Wait, the effect of pick is: you are no longer in front of x, and carrying x. So after picking blue_box_1, the agent is not in front of any object. So to drop it, they need to gotoempty, then drop. So after step 5:

6. gotoempty in room_1.

Action: gotoempty

7. Drop blue_box_1.

Action: drop blue_box_1 room_1

But maybe this isn't necessary. Wait, the constraint is that when in room_4, you have held blue_box_1 before. So even if you just pick it up and then carry it to room_4, that's better. But maybe carrying it would help in some way. Alternatively, perhaps dropping it is unnecessary. Let me think.

If I carry blue_box_1, then when I go to room_3, I can drop it there, but that's extra steps. Alternatively, after picking it up in room_1, I can carry it while unlocking the next doors. But the problem is that when you carry an object, you can't pick up another. But since we need to pick up red_ball_1 in room_3, we need to have free hands. So perhaps:

After step 5 (picking blue_box_1), then drop it in room_1. So:

6. gotoempty in room_1.

Action: gotoempty

7. drop blue_box_1 room_1.

Now, hands free. Then proceed to unlock green_door_1.

8. gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3.

Action: gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3

9. toggle green_door_1 to unlock.

Action: toggle green_door_1

10. go to room_3.

Action: gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1

Now in room_3.

11. gotodoor red_door_2 room_3 room_4.

Action: gotodoor red_door_2 room_3 room_4

12. toggle red_door_2 to unlock.

Action: toggle red_door_2

13. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_3.

Action: gotoobject red_ball_1 room_3

14. pick red_ball_1.

Action: pick red_ball_1 room_3

15. gotodoor red_door_2 room_3 room_4.

Action: gotodoor red_door_2 room_3 room_4

16. go to room_4.

Action: gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_2

Now in room_4. Now, we need to drop red_ball_1 here.

17. gotoempty in room_4.

Action: gotoempty

18. drop red_ball_1 room_4.

Action: drop red_ball_1 room_4

Now, red_ball_1 is in room_4. Now, need to get in front of red_door_2 (which is unlocked). So from room_4, go to red_door_2.

19. gotodoor red_door_2 room_4 room_3.

Action: gotodoor red_door_2 room_4 room_3

Now, the agent is in front of red_door_2, which is unlocked. This satisfies the goal.

Checking constraints:

- Must be in room_4: step 16.

- If in room_4, must have held blue_box_1 before: step 5.

- red_ball_1 in room_4: step 18.

- red_door_1 remains locked: never touched it, so yes.

This seems to satisfy all constraints. Let's count the steps. But maybe there's a shorter path. Let's see.

Alternative path: After picking blue_box_1 in room_1, carry it to room_3, then room_4. But then, when you need to pick red_ball_1, you have to drop blue_box_1 first. But that might add steps. Let's see.

Alternative steps:

1. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_1

2. toggle grey_door_1

3. gotoroom room_2 room_1 grey_door_1

4. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1

5. pick blue_box_1 room_1

6. gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3

7. toggle green_door_1

8. gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1 (carrying blue_box_1)

9. drop blue_box_1 in room_3: need to gotoempty.

10. gotoempty in room_3

11. drop blue_box_1 room_3

12. proceed to unlock red_door_2, etc.

This adds steps. So the initial plan is better.

So the original plan has 19 steps. Wait, but maybe some steps can be optimized. For example, after step 5 (picking blue_box_1), instead of dropping it, carry it to room_3 and drop it there. Then pick up red_ball_1. But would that save steps? Let's see:

Original steps after picking blue_box_1 (step5):

6. gotoempty (room_1)

7. drop blue_box_1 (room_1)

8. gotodoor green_door_1

9. toggle

10. goto room_3

11. gotodoor red_door_2

12. toggle

13. goto red_ball_1

14. pick

15. gotodoor red_door_2

16. goto room_4

17. gotoempty

18. drop

19. gotodoor red_door_2

Alternative:

After step5 (carrying blue_box_1):

6. gotodoor green_door_1 (room_1)

7. toggle

8. goto room_3 (carrying blue_box_1)

9. gotoempty in room_3

10. drop blue_box_1

11. gotodoor red_door_2

12. toggle

13. gotoobject red_ball_1

14. pick

15. gotodoor red_door_2

16. goto room_4

17. gotoempty

18. drop

19. gotodoor red_door_2

Same number of steps. So no improvement. Alternatively, maybe after step5, go to green_door_1 without dropping. Let's see:

Step5: holding blue_box_1 in room_1.

Step6: gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3 (possible as long as no object is blocking the door's position in room_1. Assuming that's okay.

Step7: toggle green_door_1.

Step8: gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1 (carrying blue_box_1).

Now in room_3.

Step9: gotoempty in room_3.

Step10: drop blue_box_1.

Then proceed as before. This is same as the alternative approach. So no step saving.

Alternatively, after dropping blue_box_1 in room_1, perhaps it's not needed. But the plan works either way.

So the initial plan is valid. Now, let's check if all preconditions are met for each action.

Check step by step:

1. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_1: Pre: in room_2 (yes), grey_door_1 connects room_2 and 1 (yes), no object blocking. Since green_box_1 is in room_2, but not mentioned to be blocking the door. Assuming allowed.

2. toggle grey_door_1: Pre: in front of it (yes, after step1).

3. gotoroom room_2 room_1 grey_door_1: Pre: in room_2 (yes), connected via grey_door_1 (yes), door is unlocked (yes after toggle).

4. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1: in room_1 (yes), blue_box_1 is there.

5. pick blue_box_1 room_1: in room_1, not holding anything (yes after step3).

6. gotoempty room_1: allowed.

7. drop blue_box_1 room_1: holding it, in room_1, front is empty (after gotoempty).

8. gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3: in room_1, door connects to room_3, no blocking.

9. toggle green_door_1: in front of it.

10. gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1: door is unlocked.

11. gotodoor red_door_2 room_3 room_4: in room_3, door connects to 4, no blocking.

12. toggle red_door_2: in front of it.

13. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_3: in room_3, red_ball_1 present.

14. pick red_ball_1: holding nothing, in room_3.

15. gotodoor red_door_2 room_3 room_4: in room_3.

16. gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_2: door unlocked.

17. gotoempty room_4: allowed.

18. drop red_ball_1: holding it, front empty.

19. gotodoor red_door_2 room_4 room_3: in room_4, door connects to 3, no blocking.

This all seems valid. The final step puts the agent in front of red_door_2 (which is red, connects room_3 and 4, and is unlocked). All constraints are met.

So the final answer would be this sequence of actions.
