Alright, let's break down the problem:

The gridworld consists of 4 rooms arranged in a square formation: 
- room_1 (north-west)
- room_2 (south-west)
- room_3 (north-east)
- room_4 (south-east)

The rooms are connected by 4 doors:
- grey_door_1 connects room_1 and room_2
- green_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3
- red_door_1 connects room_2 and room_4
- red_door_2 connects room_3 and room_4

The initial state of the world is:
- You are in room_2
- green_ball_1 is in room_1
- blue_box_1 is in room_1
- green_box_1 is in room_2
- yellow_box_1 is in room_3
- red_ball_1 is in room_3
- red_ball_2 is in room_3
- green_ball_2 is in room_4
- yellow_box_2 is in room_4
- All doors are locked

The goal is to bring about:
- There is a door d such that 
  - d is red
  - room_3 and room_4 are connected via d
  - you are in front of d
  - d is not locked

Given the facts, the door d in the goal is clearly red_door_2, which connects room_3 and room_4. So the goal is to unlock red_door_2 and be in front of it.

The constraints are:
1. You must be in room_4 at some point.
2. If you are in room_4, then you must have been holding blue_box_1 earlier.
3. red_ball_1, which starts in room_3, must be in room_4 at some point.
4. red_door_1 must always remain locked.

Let's plan our approach. We need to:

1. Go from room_2 to room_1 via grey_door_1 to pick up blue_box_1.
2. Go back to room_2 and then to room_3 via room_1 and green_door_1.
3. Once in room_3, pick up red_ball_1.
4. Unlock red_door_2, which connects room_3 and room_4.
5. Go to room_4 via red_door_2 (we need to have held blue_box_1 before this point, which we have).
6. Drop red_ball_1 in room_4.
7. Go back to room_3 via red_door_2.
8. Stand in front of red_door_2, which is unlocked.

Let's start planning the actions:

1. First, we need to go to grey_door_1, unlock it, and go to room_1 to pick up blue_box_1.
2. Then, we need to go back to room_2 using grey_door_1, and then go to green_door_1, unlock it, and go to room_3.
3. In room_3, we pick up red_ball_1, then go to red_door_2, unlock it, and go to room_4.
4. In room_4, we drop red_ball_1, then go back to room_3 using red_door_2, and finally go to red_door_2 and stand in front of it.

Let's write out the plan:

1. `gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_1` - Go to grey_door_1 in room_2.
2. `toggle grey_door_1` - Unlock grey_door_1.
3. `gotoroom room_2 room_1 grey_door_1` - Go to room_1 using grey_door_1.
4. `gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1` - Go to blue_box_1 in room_1.
5. `pick blue_box_1 room_1` - Pick up blue_box_1.

Wait, we need to satisfy the constraint that we've held blue_box_1 before entering room_4, but we also need to have our hands free to pick up red_ball_1 and to toggle the doors. Let's revise. After picking up blue_box_1, we can drop it in room_1, which will satisfy our constraint.

1. `gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_1` - Go to grey_door_1 in room_2.
2. `toggle grey_door_1` - Unlock grey_door_1.
3. `gotoroom room_2 room_1 grey_door_1` - Go to room_1 using grey_door_1.
4. `gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1` - Go to blue_box_1 in room_1.
5. `pick blue_box_1 room_1` - Pick up blue_box_1.
6. `gotoempty` - Go to an empty position in room_1.
7. `drop blue_box_1 room_1` - Drop blue_box_1.

Now we need to go to room_3, pick up red_ball_1, and then go to room_4 via red_door_2.

8. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3` - Go to green_door_1 in room_1.
9. `toggle green_door_1` - Unlock green_door_1.
10. `gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1` - Go to room_3 using green_door_1.
11. `gotoobject red_ball_1 room_3` - Go to red_ball_1 in room_3.
12. `pick red_ball_1 room_3` - Pick up red_ball_1.
13. `gotodoor red_door_2 room_3 room_4` - Go to red_door_2 in room_3.
14. `toggle red_door_2` - Unlock red_door_2.
15. `gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_2` - Go to room_4 using red_door_2.
16. `gotoempty` - Go to an empty position in room_4.
17. `drop red_ball_1 room_4` - Drop red_ball_1 in room_4.

Now we need to go back to room_3 and stand in front of red_door_2, which is unlocked.

18. `gotodoor red_door_2 room_4 room_3` - Go to red_door_2 in room_4.
19. `gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_2` - Go to room_3 using red_door_2.
20. `gotodoor red_door_2 room_3 room_4` - Go to red_door_2 in room_3.

Wait, I realized a problem. The constraint says "If you are in room_4, then you must have been holding blue_box_1 earlier," which means we need to have actually held blue_box_1, not just be in the same room as it. Let's revise our plan...

1. `gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_1` - Go to grey_door_1 in room_2.
2. `toggle grey_door_1` - Unlock grey_door_1.
3. `gotoroom room_2 room_1 grey_door_1` - Go to room_1 using grey_door_1.
4. `gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1` - Go to blue_box_1 in room_1.
5. `pick blue_box_1 room_1` - Pick up blue_box_1.
6. `gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2` - Go to grey_door_1 in room_1.
7. `gotoroom room_1 room_2 grey_door_1` - Go to room_2 using grey_door_1.
8. `gotoempty` - Go to an empty position in room_2.
9. `drop blue_box_1 room_2` - Drop blue_box_1 in room_2.
10. `gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_1` - Go to grey_door_1 in room_2.
11. `gotoroom room_2 room_1 grey_door_1` - Go to room_1 using grey_door_1.
12. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3` - Go to green_door_1 in room_1.
13. `toggle green_door_1` - Unlock green_door_1.
14. `gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1` - Go to room_3 using green_door_1.
15. `gotoobject red_ball_1 room_3` - Go to red_ball_1 in room_3.
16. `pick red_ball_1 room_3` - Pick up red_ball_1.
17. `gotodoor red_door_2 room_3 room_4` - Go to red_door_2 in room_3.
18. `toggle red_door_2` - Unlock red_door_2.
19. `gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_2` - Go to room_4 using red_door_2.
20. `gotoempty` - Go to an empty position in room_4.
21. `drop red_ball_1 room_4` - Drop red_ball_1 in room_4.
22. `gotodoor red_door_2 room_4 room_3` - Go to red_door_2 in room_4.
23. `gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_2` - Go to room_3 using red_door_2.
24. `gotodoor red_door_2 room_3 room_4` - Go to red_door_2 in room_3.

Hmm, I realize I'm overcomplicating. Let's focus on the constraints:

1. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'you are in room_4'": This means I need to go to room_4 at some point.
2. "If expression 'you are in room_4' holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: 'you are holding blue_box_1'": This means I need to be holding blue_box_1 before I go to room_4.
3. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'red_ball_1 is in room_4'": This means I need to move red_ball_1 to room_4 at some point.
4. "The following expression must hold in every state: 'red_door_1 is locked'": This means I can't use red_door_1 at any point.

Given these constraints, I need to:
- Get blue_box_1 (which is in room_1) and hold it.
- Get to room_4 (which means I need to go through room_3 and then through red_door_2, since red_door_1 must remain locked).
- Move red_ball_1 (which is in room_3) to room_4.
- Finally, be in room_3 in front of an unlocked red_door_2.

Let's simplify our plan:

1. `gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_1` - Go to grey_door_1 in room_2.
2. `toggle grey_door_1` - Unlock grey_door_1.
3. `gotoroom room_2 room_1 grey_door_1` - Go to room_1 using grey_door_1.
4. `gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1` - Go to blue_box_1 in room_1.
5. `pick blue_box_1 room_1` - Pick up blue_box_1.
6. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3` - Go to green_door_1 in room_1.
7. `toggle green_door_1` - Unlock green_door_1.
8. `gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1` - Go to room_3 using green_door_1.
9. `gotoempty` - Go to an empty position in room_3.
10. `drop blue_box_1 room_3` - Drop blue_box_1 in room_3 (we've satisfied constraint 2).
11. `gotoobject red_ball_1 room_3` - Go to red_ball_1 in room_3.
12. `pick red_ball_1 room_3` - Pick up red_ball_1.
13. `gotodoor red_door_2 room_3 room_4` - Go to red_door_2 in room_3.
14. `toggle red_door_2` - Unlock red_door_2.
15. `gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_2` - Go to room_4 using red_door_2 (we've satisfied constraint 1).
16. `gotoempty` - Go to an empty position in room_4.
17. `drop red_ball_1 room_4` - Drop red_ball_1 in room_4 (we've satisfied constraint 3).
18. `gotodoor red_door_2 room_4 room_3` - Go to red_door_2 in room_4.
19. `gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_2` - Go to room_3 using red_door_2.
20. `gotodoor red_door_2 room_3 room_4` - Go to red_door_2 in room_3. (we've satisfied the main goal)

Actually, I think there's a more straightforward approach that minimizes actions. Let's try:

1. `gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_1` - Go to grey_door_1 in room_2.
2. `toggle grey_door_1` - Unlock grey_door_1.
3. `gotoroom room_2 room_1 grey_door_1` - Go to room_1 using grey_door_1.
4. `gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1` - Go to blue_box_1 in room_1.
5. `pick blue_box_1 room_1` - Pick up blue_box_1.
6. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3` - Go to green_door_1 in room_1.
7. `toggle green_door_1` - Unlock green_door_1.
8. `gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1` - Go to room_3 using green_door_1.
9. `gotodoor red_door_2 room_3 room_4` - Go to red_door_2 in room_3.
10. `toggle red_door_2` - Unlock red_door_2.
11. `gotoempty` - Go to an empty position in room_3.
12. `drop blue_box_1 room_3` - Drop blue_box_1 in room_3 (we've satisfied constraint 2).
13. `gotoobject red_ball_1 room_3` - Go to red_ball_1 in room_3.
14. `pick red_ball_1 room_3` - Pick up red_ball_1.
15. `gotodoor red_door_2 room_3 room_4` - Go to red_door_2 in room_3.
16. `gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_2` - Go to room_4 using red_door_2 (we've satisfied constraint 1).
17. `gotoempty` - Go to an empty position in room_4.
18. `drop red_ball_1 room_4` - Drop red_ball_1 in room_4 (we've satisfied constraint 3).
19. `gotodoor red_door_2 room_4 room_3` - Go to red_door_2 in room_4.
20. `gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_2` - Go to room_3 using red_door_2.
21. `gotodoor red_door_2 room_3 room_4` - Go to red_door_2 in room_3. (we've satisfied the main goal)

Let's double-check that this plan satisfies all constraints:

1. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'you are in room_4'": Satisfied in step 16.
2. "If expression 'you are in room_4' holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: 'you are holding blue_box_1'": Satisfied in step 5, which is before step 16.
3. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'red_ball_1 is in room_4'": Satisfied in step 18.
4. "The following expression must hold in every state: 'red_door_1 is locked'": Satisfied throughout the plan, as we never unlock red_door_1.

And the main goal:
- There is a door d such that 
  - d is red (red_door_2 is red)
  - room_3 and room_4 are connected via d (red_door_2 connects room_3 and room_4)
  - you are in front of d (satisfied in step 21)
  - d is not locked (red_door_2 is unlocked in step 10)

The plan is valid.

Actually, I spotted a mistake. Step 11 tells us to go to an empty position in room_3 but we're already in front of red_door_2. Let's fix that by ensuring we only go to an empty position when necessary.

1. `gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_1` - Go to grey_door_1 in room_2.
2. `toggle grey_door_1` - Unlock grey_door_1.
3. `gotoroom room_2 room_1 grey_door_1` - Go to room_1 using grey_door_1.
4. `gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1` - Go to blue_box_1 in room_1.
5. `pick blue_box_1 room_1` - Pick up blue_box_1.
6. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3` - Go to green_door_1 in room_1.
7. `toggle green_door_1` - Unlock green_door_1.
8. `gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1` - Go to room_3 using green_door_1.
9. `gotodoor red_door_2 room_3 room_4` - Go to red_door_2 in room_3.
10. `toggle red_door_2` - Unlock red_door_2.
11. `gotoobject red_ball_1 room_3` - Go to red_ball_1 in room_3.
12. `gotoempty` - Go to an empty position in room_3.
13. `drop blue_box_1 room_3` - Drop blue_box_1 in room_3 (we've satisfied constraint 2).
14. `gotoobject red_ball_1 room_3` - Go to red_ball_1 in room_3.
15. `pick red_ball_1 room_3` - Pick up red_ball_1.
16. `gotodoor red_door_2 room_3 room_4` - Go to red_door_2 in room_3.
17. `gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_2` - Go to room_4 using red_door_2 (we've satisfied constraint 1).
18. `gotoempty` - Go to an empty position in room_4.
19. `drop red_ball_1 room_4` - Drop red_ball_1 in room_4 (we've satisfied constraint 3).
20. `gotodoor red_door_2 room_4 room_3` - Go to red_door_2 in room_4.
21. `gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_2` - Go to room_3 using red_door_2.
22. `gotodoor red_door_2 room_3 room_4` - Go to red_door_2 in room_3. (we've satisfied the main goal)

Wait, that doesn't look right. Let me check if there are any logical mistakes in this plan.

In step 11, we go to red_ball_1 in room_3. We haven't dropped blue_box_1 yet, so our hands aren't empty. Then in step 12-13, we go to an empty position and drop blue_box_1. After that, in step 14-15, we go to red_ball_1 (which is still in room_3) and pick it up. This sequence seems correct.

I think there's a mistake in the steps around dropping blue_box_1 and picking up red_ball_1. If we're already holding blue_box_1, we need to drop it first before we can pick up red_ball_1. Let's clarify this sequence:

1. We are in room_3 holding blue_box_1.
2. We go to red_door_2 and unlock it.
3. We need to pick up red_ball_1, but we're already holding blue_box_1, so we need to drop it first. To drop it, we need to go to an empty position.
4. After dropping blue_box_1, we go to red_ball_1 and pick it up.
5. We then go to red_door_2, go to room_4, drop red_ball_1, go back to room_3, and stand in front of red_door_2.

Let's correct our plan:

1. `gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_1` - Go to grey_door_1 in room_2.
2. `toggle grey_door_1` - Unlock grey_door_1.
3. `gotoroom room_2 room_1 grey_door_1` - Go to room_1 using grey_door_1.
4. `gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1` - Go to blue_box_1 in room_1.
5. `pick blue_box_1 room_1` - Pick up blue_box_1.
6. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3` - Go to green_door_1 in room_1.
7. `toggle green_door_1` - Unlock green_door_1.
8. `gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1` - Go to room_3 using green_door_1.
9. `gotodoor red_door_2 room_3 room_4` - Go to red_door_2 in room_3.
10. `toggle red_door_2` - Unlock red_door_2.
11. `gotoempty` - Go to an empty position in room_3.
12. `drop blue_box_1 room_3` - Drop blue_box_1 in room_3 (we've satisfied constraint 2).
13. `gotoobject red_ball_1 room_3` - Go to red_ball_1 in room_3.
14. `pick red_ball_1 room_3` - Pick up red_ball_1.
15. `gotodoor red_door_2 room_3 room_4` - Go to red_door_2 in room_3.
16. `gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_2` - Go to room_4 using red_door_2 (we've satisfied constraint 1).
17. `gotoempty` - Go to an empty position in room_4.
18. `drop red_ball_1 room_4` - Drop red_ball_1 in room_4 (we've satisfied constraint 3).
19. `gotodoor red_door_2 room_4 room_3` - Go to red_door_2 in room_4.
20. `gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_2` - Go to room_3 using red_door_2.
21. `gotodoor red_door_2 room_3 room_4` - Go to red_door_2 in room_3. (we've satisfied the main goal)

I believe this plan now properly sequences the actions of dropping blue_box_1 and picking up red_ball_1.

Let's triple-check:

1. We start in room_2.
2. We go to room_1, pick up blue_box_1, and go to room_3.
3. In room_3, we unlock red_door_2, drop blue_box_1, pick up red_ball_1, and go to room_4.
4. In room_4, we drop red_ball_1 and go back to room_3.
5. In room_3, we stand in front of red_door_2, which is unlocked.

This plan satisfies all constraints and the main goal, and it ensures that all actions are performed in the correct order.

Actually, let me double-check if we need to hold the blue box before entering room_4, or if we just need to have held it at any point before entering room_4. The constraint reads "If expression 'you are in room_4' holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: 'you are holding blue_box_1'"

This seems to indicate that we just need to have held blue_box_1 at any point before entering room_4, not necessarily immediately before. Therefore, our sequence of dropping blue_box_1 in room_3, picking up red_ball_1, and then going to room_4 holding red_ball_1 should satisfy this constraint.

I believe our final plan is correct, but I'm not sure if we're duplicating any steps.

1. `gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_1` - Go to grey_door_1 in room_2.
2. `toggle grey_door_1` - Unlock grey_door_1.
3. `gotoroom room_2 room_1 grey_door_1` - Go to room_1 using grey_door_1.
4. `gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1` - Go to blue_box_1 in room_1.
5. `pick blue_box_1 room_1` - Pick up blue_box_1.
6. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3` - Go to green_door_1 in room_1.
7. `toggle green_door_1` - Unlock green_door_1.
8. `gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1` - Go to room_3 using green_door_1.
9. `gotodoor red_door_2 room_3 room_4` - Go to red_door_2 in room_3.
10. `toggle red_door_2` - Unlock red_door_2.
11. `gotoempty` - Go to an empty position in room_3.
12. `drop blue_box_1 room_3` - Drop blue_box_1 in room_3.
13. `gotoobject red_ball_1 room_3` - Go to red_ball_1 in room_3.
14. `pick red_ball_1 room_3` - Pick up red_ball_1.
15. `gotodoor red_door_2 room_3 room_4` - Go to red_door_2 in room_3.
16. `gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_2` - Go to room_4 using red_door_2.
17. `gotoempty` - Go to an empty position in room_4.
18. `drop red_ball_1 room_4` - Drop red_ball_1 in room_4.
19. `gotodoor red_door_2 room_4 room_3` - Go to red_door_2 in room_4.
20. `gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_2` - Go to room_3 using red_door_2.
21. `gotodoor red_door_2 room_3 room_4` - Go to red_door_2 in room_3.

I believe this plan is optimized and satisfies all constraints and the main goal. But let me recheck to make sure.

The goal is to be in front of red_door_2 in room_3, with red_door_2 being unlocked. The constraints are:
1. We need to visit room_4 at some point.
2. Before we visit room_4, we need to have held blue_box_1 at some point.
3. Red_ball_1 needs to be in room_4 at some point.
4. Red_door_1 must always remain locked.

Let's check if our plan satisfies these:

1. We visit room_4 in step 16. ✓
2. We hold blue_box_1 in step 5, which is before step 16. ✓
3. Red_ball_1 is in room_4 after step 18. ✓
4. We never toggle red_door_1, so it remains locked throughout. ✓

The plan also achieves the main goal, as we end up in front of red_door_2 in room_3, and red_door_2 is unlocked (we unlock it in step 10).

This plan is valid, and I don't see any unnecessary or redundant steps. This should be our final answer.

Hmm, when I drop an object, one of the effects is "your hands are empty". When I go to room_4 holding red_ball_1 and drop it, do I need to specifically go to an empty position, or can I drop it just after entering the room? Let me check.

The preconditions for "drop" are:
1. You may only drop an object x if (i) you are currently holding x, and (ii) the position in front of you is empty.

And the effects are:
1. You are no longer carrying x.
2. You are in front of x.
3. Your hands are empty.
4. Object x is situated in the room you are currently in.

So, when I enter room_4, I'm not in front of any object, since the "goto room" action has the effect "if you were in front of some object or door x0, then you are no longer in front of x0." I should be able to drop red_ball_1 immediately after entering room_4 without needing to use the "goto empty" action. The position in front of me is already empty.

Let's revise our plan once more to ensure it's as efficient as possible:

1. `gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_1` - Go to grey_door_1 in room_2.
2. `toggle grey_door_1` - Unlock grey_door_1.
3. `gotoroom room_2 room_1 grey_door_1` - Go to room_1 using grey_door_1.
4. `gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1` - Go to blue_box_1 in room_1.
5. `pick blue_box_1 room_1` - Pick up blue_box_1.
6. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3` - Go to green_door_1 in room_1.
7. `toggle green_door_1` - Unlock green_door_1.
8. `gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1` - Go to room_3 using green_door_1.
9. `gotoempty` - Go to an empty position in room_3.
10. `drop blue_box_1 room_3` - Drop blue_box_1 in room_3.
11. `gotoobject red_ball_1 room_3` - Go to red_ball_1 in room_3.
12. `pick red_ball_1 room_3` - Pick up red_ball_1.
13. `gotodoor red_door_2 room_3 room_4` - Go to red_door_2 in room_3.
14. `toggle red_door_2` - Unlock red_door_2.
15. `gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_2` - Go to room_4 using red_door_2.
16. `drop red_ball_1 room_4` - Drop red_ball_1 in room_4. (Since we just entered the room, the position in front of us is empty)
17. `gotodoor red_door_2 room_4 room_3` - Go to red_door_2 in room_4.
18. `gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_2` - Go to room_3 using red_door_2.
19. `gotodoor red_door_2 room_3 room_4` - Go to red_door_2 in room_3.

Actually, I realized there's an issue here. After entering room_4, according to the effect of "gotoroom", the position in front of us is not necessarily empty. It just says "if you were in front of some object or door x0, then you are no longer in front of x0." It doesn't specify what's in front of us after entering the room. We might still need to use the "gotoempty" action to ensure we're in front of an empty position before dropping the ball.

I'm going back and forth on this, but to be safe, let's keep the "gotoempty" action before dropping the ball in room_4. Also, I realized there might be a mistake after reviewing the preconditions for `toggle`: We can only toggle a door if we're in front of it.

This means I need to ensure we're in front of a door before attempting to toggle it. Let's revise our steps again.

Wait, the issue is: after we pick up red_ball_1, we need to go to red_door_2, toggle it, and then go through it. But we're already holding red_ball_1 when we try to toggle the door. Let's think through this…

1. We are in room_3, have dropped blue_box_1, and picked up red_ball_1.
2. We want to go to red_door_2 and unlock it, but we're already holding red_ball_1.
3. So, we can either drop red_ball_1 temporarily, toggle red_door_2, and then pick up red_ball_1 again, or we can toggle red_door_2 while holding red_ball_1.

Wait, let me double-check the preconditions for toggle. The precondition for toggle is just "you may only toggle a door d if you are in front of d." There's no requirement to have empty hands.

In that case, steps 11-16 in our revised plan should be:

11. `gotoobject red_ball_1 room_3` - Go to red_ball_1 in room_3.
12. `pick red_ball_1 room_3` - Pick up red_ball_1.
13. `gotodoor red_door_2 room_3 room_4` - Go to red_door_2 in room_3.
14. `toggle red_door_2` - Unlock red_door_2. (We can do this while holding red_ball_1)
15. `gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_2` - Go to room_4 using red_door_2.
16. `gotoempty` - Go to an empty position in room_4.

I think this is correct. Let's reclaim our plan from the start:

1. `gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_1` - Go to grey_door_1 in room_2.
2. `toggle grey_door_1` - Unlock grey_door_1.
3. `gotoroom room_2 room_1 grey_door_1` - Go to room_1 using grey_door_1.
4. `gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1` - Go to blue_box_1 in room_1.
5. `pick blue_box_1 room_1` - Pick up blue_box_1.
6. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3` - Go to green_door_1 in room_1.
7. `toggle green_door_1` - Unlock green_door_1.
8. `gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1` - Go to room_3 using green_door_1.
9. `gotoempty` - Go to an empty position in room_3.
10. `drop blue_box_1 room_3` - Drop blue_box_1 in room_3.
11. `gotoobject red_ball_1 room_3` - Go to red_ball_1 in room_3.
12. `pick red_ball_1 room_3` - Pick up red_ball_1.
13. `gotodoor red_door_2 room_3 room_4` - Go to red_door_2 in room_3.
14. `toggle red_door_2` - Unlock red_door_2.
15. `gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_2` - Go to room_4 using red_door_2.
16. `gotoempty` - Go to an empty position in room_4.
17. `drop red_ball_1 room_4` - Drop red_ball_1 in room_4.
18. `gotodoor red_door_2 room_4 room_3` - Go to red_door_2 in room_4.
19. `gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_2` - Go to room_3 using red_door_2.
20. `gotodoor red_door_2 room_3 room_4` - Go to red_door_2 in room_3.

This plan should be correct now. Let's verify one more time.
