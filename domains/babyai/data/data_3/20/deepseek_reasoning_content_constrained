Okay, let's tackle this planning problem step by step. The goal is to end up in front of a grey ball, which is grey_ball_1. The initial state has me in room_4, and the grey_ball_1 is also in room_4. So, maybe I can just pick it up or drop it there? Wait, the goal is to be in front of it. Let's check the goal again. The final goal is "There is a ball v such that v is grey and you are in front of v." So I just need to be in front of grey_ball_1. Since it's already in room_4 where I am, maybe I can go to it directly. But wait, the initial state says I'm in room_4, but am I in front of anything? The initial state doesn't mention that. So perhaps my first action is to gotoobject grey_ball_1 in room_4. But wait, can I do that? The preconditions for gotoobject are that I'm in the same room as the object. Since I'm in room_4 and the grey_ball_1 is in room_4, that's possible. Then the action would put me in front of it. But wait, let's check the constraints. The constraints are that at some point, the yellow_door_1 is unlocked, I hold the grey_ball_1, and I'm in front of red_box_1. So even if the direct path seems possible, I need to satisfy those constraints.

So the plan needs to include actions that meet those three constraints. Let's list the constraints again:

1. At least one state where yellow_door_1 is not locked.
2. At least one state where I'm holding grey_ball_1.
3. At least one state where I'm in front of red_box_1.

So I need to make sure that during the plan, each of these conditions is met at least once.

First, let's see where red_box_1 is. It's in room_1. So to be in front of red_box_1, I need to go to room_1. But initially, I'm in room_4. To get to room_1, I need to move through doors. Let's look at the door connections:

- room_1 is connected to room_2 via grey_door_1, and to room_3 via yellow_door_1.
- room_2 is connected to room_4 via purple_door_1.
- room_3 is connected to room_4 via red_door_1.

All doors start locked. So to move between rooms, I need to unlock doors. But the toggle action requires being in front of the door, which requires going to the door. However, if an object is blocking the door's position, I can't goto the door. The initial state doesn't mention any objects blocking doors, so maybe all doors are accessible if I can reach them.

Let me outline the possible path from room_4 to room_1. From room_4, I can go to room_3 via red_door_1, but it's locked. Alternatively, from room_4 to room_2 via purple_door_1, which is also locked. So first, I need to unlock doors.

Wait, but the doors in the initial state are all locked. So to unlock a door, I need to be in front of it and toggle it. So maybe I can unlock red_door_1 first. Since I'm in room_4, the red_door_1 connects room_4 and room_3. So I can goto the red_door_1 from room_4. Let's check: the gotodoor action's preconditions. I can go to a door if I'm in a room connected by it and no object is blocking the door's position. Are there any objects blocking doors? The initial state doesn't mention any, so perhaps they are unblocked. So, I can go to red_door_1 from room_4. Then toggle it to unlock. Then use gotoroom to go to room_3. Then in room_3, maybe go to yellow_door_1 (which connects room_1 and room_3), unlock it (since it's locked initially), then go to room_1. Then in room_1, gotoobject red_box_1. That would satisfy the third constraint. Then I need to get back to room_4 to handle the grey_ball_1. Wait, but the grey_ball_1 is already in room_4. But I need to hold it at some point. So perhaps after unlocking the necessary doors and visiting red_box_1, I can return to room_4, pick up the grey_ball_1, then drop it again to be in front of it. But the goal is to be in front of it, not necessarily holding it. However, the constraint requires that at some point I hold it. Let's plan step by step.

First, the initial state: in room_4. Need to unlock yellow_door_1 at some point. Yellow_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3. So to unlock it, I need to be in either room_1 or room_3 and go to the door. But initially, I'm in room_4. So perhaps the path is room_4 → room_3 via red_door_1 (unlock it first), then room_3 → room_1 via yellow_door_1 (unlock that), then room_1 → room_3 → room_4, etc.

Alternatively, maybe another path. Let's think of the steps needed:

Constraints:

1. Unlock yellow_door_1 at some point. So, need to toggle it when it's locked. So, first, get in front of yellow_door_1, toggle it. To get in front of it, must be in room_1 or room_3. So to reach room_3, need to unlock red_door_1 (since it's connecting room_4 and room_3). Let's start there.

Step 1: In room_4. Need to unlock red_door_1. So goto red_door_1 from room_4. Action: gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_3. Then toggle it. That would unlock it.

Then, gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_1. Now in room_3. Then, need to go to yellow_door_1 (connecting room_1 and room_3). So gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1. Then toggle it to unlock. Now, yellow_door_1 is unlocked. That satisfies the first constraint. Now, go to room_1 via gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_1. Now in room_1. Here, red_box_1 is present. So gotoobject red_box_1 room_1. This satisfies the third constraint (being in front of red_box_1). Then, perhaps proceed to pick up something? Wait, but the second constraint is to hold grey_ball_1. Which is in room_4. So after handling room_1, need to get back to room_4. Let's see. From room_1, maybe go back to room_3 via yellow_door_1 (already unlocked), then to room_4 via red_door_1 (unlocked earlier). Once back in room_4, go to grey_ball_1, pick it up (satisfying the second constraint), then drop it again to be in front of it. But the goal is to be in front of it. So maybe:

After returning to room_4, gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_4. Then, since the goal is to be in front of it, maybe that's the last action. But wait, the initial state says the grey_ball_1 is in room_4. So if I can just gotoobject it while in room_4, but the constraints require that I also have to hold it at some point. So perhaps:

Once back in room_4, gotoempty (to be in front of empty), then pick grey_ball_1. That would require being in the same room and not holding anything. Then drop it, but why? The goal is to be in front of it. Wait, if I pick it up, then drop it again, I can be in front of it after dropping. Let's see:

After picking up grey_ball_1, the effect is that I'm carrying it, and it's no longer in the room. Then, to drop it, I need to be in front of an empty position. So gotoempty, then drop grey_ball_1. Then I'm in front of it. But maybe there's a simpler way. Let's think.

But maybe the order is:

In room_4, gotoobject grey_ball_1 (precondition: same room). Then pick it up (satisfies the constraint of holding it). Then drop it (but to drop, I need to be in front of an empty position. So after picking, I'm no longer in front of it. So I need to gotoempty, then drop it. Then I'm in front of it. So the final state would be in front of grey_ball_1. Let's outline steps:

1. Unlock red_door_1 (from room_4)
2. Go to room_3 via red_door_1
3. Unlock yellow_door_1 (from room_3)
4. Go to room_1 via yellow_door_1
5. Goto red_box_1 (satisfy third constraint)
6. Return to room_4 via room_3
7. Goto grey_ball_1, pick it up (satisfy second constraint)
8. Gotoempty, drop grey_ball_1 (now in front of it)

But let's check the steps in detail.

Starting in room_4.

Action 1: gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_3. (Precondition: in room_4, door connects room_4 and room_3. No object blocking. So possible.)

Action 2: toggle red_door_1. Now red_door_1 is unlocked.

Action 3: gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_1. Now in room_3.

Action 4: gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1. (Yellow_door_1 connects room_3 and room_1.)

Action 5: toggle yellow_door_1. Now yellow_door_1 is unlocked. This satisfies the first constraint (yellow_door_1 is not locked in this state).

Action 6: gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_1. Now in room_1.

Action 7: gotoobject red_box_1 room_1. Now in front of red_box_1, satisfying the third constraint.

Then, need to get back to room_4. So from room_1, go back to room_3 via yellow_door_1 (already unlocked).

Action 8: gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3.

Wait, but gotodoor's syntax is "gotodoor d r1 r2" where you are in r1. So from room_1, gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3.

Action 8: gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3.

Action 9: gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1. Now back in room_3.

Then from room_3, go to room_4 via red_door_1 (already unlocked).

Action 10: gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_4.

Action 11: gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_1. Back in room_4.

Now, in room_4. Need to pick up grey_ball_1. So:

Action 12: gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_4. (Now in front of it.)

Action 13: pick grey_ball_1 room_4. Now holding it, which satisfies the second constraint.

But after picking, you're no longer in front of it. To drop it and be in front of it, you need to go to an empty spot, then drop.

Action 14: gotoempty. (Now in front of empty.)

Action 15: drop grey_ball_1 room_4. Now, after dropping, you're in front of grey_ball_1. Which satisfies the goal.

So the plan would be 15 actions. But maybe there's a shorter way. Let's check if some steps can be merged.

Wait, after action 13 (pick grey_ball_1), I'm holding it. Then I need to drop it to be in front of it. But to drop, I need to be in front of an empty position. So after picking, I need to go to empty, then drop. So steps 14 and 15 are necessary.

But what if after picking, I don't drop it, but just gotoempty and then drop? But the goal requires being in front of the ball. So dropping it in front of me would achieve that.

Alternatively, maybe after picking, the ball is no longer in the room. Wait, the effect of pick is that the object is no longer in the room. So if I pick grey_ball_1 in room_4, it's removed from the room. Then when I drop it, it's placed back in the current room (room_4) and I'm in front of it. So yes, that would work.

So the steps seem necessary. But let's check if the order of unlocking doors can be optimized. For example, maybe we can unlock yellow_door_1 first, but that's in room_3, which requires going through red_door_1 first.

Is there a way to satisfy the constraints with fewer steps? Let's think. The constraints require that at some point, yellow_door_1 is unlocked, which we do in action 5. Then that we hold grey_ball_1 in action 13. And that we are in front of red_box_1 in action 7. So those steps are necessary.

Another thought: when returning to room_4, after visiting room_1, perhaps we can go via room_2. Let's see. From room_1, can we go to room_2 via grey_door_1, which is locked. So to unlock grey_door_1, which connects room_1 and room_2, we'd need to be in front of it. But since we're in room_1, maybe goto grey_door_1, toggle it, then go to room_2, then to room_4 via purple_door_1 (which is locked). That might add more steps. Probably not better.

So the initial plan of 15 steps seems necessary. Let's count again:

1. gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_3
2. toggle red_door_1
3. gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_1
4. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1
5. toggle yellow_door_1
6. gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_1
7. gotoobject red_box_1 room_1
8. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3
9. gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1
10. gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_4
11. gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_1
12. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_4
13. pick grey_ball_1 room_4
14. gotoempty
15. drop grey_ball_1 room_4

But wait, action 8 is gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3. Then action 9 is gotoroom to room_3. Then action 10 is gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_4, action 11 gotoroom to room_4. Then 12-15. So that's 15 steps. Is there any way to make this shorter?

For example, after step 7 (gotoobject red_box_1), can we go back to room_4 without going through room_3? Let's see. From room_1, the doors are grey_door_1 (to room_2) and yellow_door_1 (to room_3). To get to room_4, the only path is through room_3 (yellow_door_1) and then room_3 to room_4 (red_door_1). So the path is necessary.

Alternatively, maybe after unlocking yellow_door_1, can we avoid going to room_1? No, because we need to be in front of red_box_1, which is in room_1.

So perhaps the steps are necessary.

But let's check if some steps can be merged. For example, when in room_4 initially, after unlocking red_door_1 and moving to room_3, we can then unlock yellow_door_1 and proceed to room_1, etc.

Another thought: when we are in front of red_box_1 (step 7), can we pick it up? But the constraints don't require that, and we need to hold grey_ball_1. But perhaps it's unnecessary. So no, we can leave it.

Wait, the constraints require that in at least one state, we are in front of red_box_1. So step 7 satisfies that. Then we can proceed back.

Another possible optimization: after step 11 (back in room_4), instead of going to grey_ball_1, can we go to empty, then pick it up? Wait, to pick up an object, you have to be in the same room as the object and in front of it. So to pick grey_ball_1 in room_4, you need to be in front of it. So step 12 is necessary.

Wait, but after step 11, we are in room_4. We can goto grey_ball_1 (step 12), pick it (step13), then gotoempty (step14), drop (step15). That's four actions. But maybe after picking, we can drop immediately? No, because after picking, you are no longer in front of the object. So to drop, you need to be in front of an empty spot. So yes, steps 14 and 15 are needed.

So I think the 15-step plan is the minimum. But maybe there's a shorter way. Let's see.

Alternative approach: What if instead of going all the way to room_1, can we find another way to satisfy being in front of red_box_1? But red_box_1 is in room_1, so we must go there.

Another idea: Maybe after unlocking red_door_1 and yellow_door_1, go to room_1, then return to room_4 via room_3 and room_4. Then, once in room_4, handle the grey_ball_1. But that seems the same as the original plan.

Alternatively, can we unlock the doors in a different order? For example, unlock purple_door_1 (connects room_2 and room_4) first. But purple_door_1 is in room_2 and room_4. But initial state is room_4. So to unlock purple_door_1, need to goto it from room_4. Let's check: purple_door_1 connects room_2 and room_4. So from room_4, can we goto purple_door_1? Yes. So:

Alternative plan:

1. goto purple_door_1 from room_4 (gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_2)
2. toggle to unlock it.
3. gotoroom room_4 to room_2 via purple_door_1.
4. Then in room_2, can unlock grey_door_1 (connecting to room_1) and then proceed to room_1. But grey_door_1 is locked initially. So steps would be:

But this path would require more steps. Let's see:

1. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_2
2. toggle purple_door_1 (now unlocked)
3. gotoroom room_4 room_2 purple_door_1
4. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_1
5. toggle grey_door_1 (unlock)
6. gotoroom room_2 room_1 grey_door_1
7. gotoobject red_box_1 room_1 (satisfy constraint)
8. Then need to get back to room_4 via room_2 and purple_door_1 (unlocked)
9. In room_4, handle grey_ball_1.

But this path requires unlocking purple_door_1 and grey_door_1. However, the first constraint is that yellow_door_1 must be unlocked at some point. So this approach doesn't satisfy that constraint. Therefore, this path is invalid because it doesn't unlock yellow_door_1. Hence, the original plan is necessary.

Thus, the original plan is required to unlock yellow_door_1, which is necessary for the first constraint.

Therefore, the initial 15-step plan seems to be the minimal. Let's verify each constraint:

1. yellow_door_1 is unlocked in step 5.
2. holding grey_ball_1 in step 13.
3. in front of red_box_1 in step 7.

All constraints are met. The final action (step15) drops grey_ball_1, putting the agent in front of it, satisfying the goal.

So the plan is valid. Let's write it out in the required format.
