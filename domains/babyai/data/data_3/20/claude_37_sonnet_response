Let me break down the problem:

We're in a 2D gridworld with 4 rooms arranged in a square:
- room_1 (north-west)
- room_2 (south-west)
- room_3 (north-east)
- room_4 (south-east)

The rooms are connected by 4 doors:
- grey_door_1 connects room_1 and room_2
- yellow_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3
- purple_door_1 connects room_2 and room_4
- red_door_1 connects room_3 and room_4

Initially:
- We are in room_4.
- All doors are locked.

Objects present:
- room_1 has red_box_1 and green_box_1
- room_2 has grey_box_1 and red_ball_1
- room_3 has blue_ball_1
- room_4 has green_box_2, yellow_ball_1, and grey_ball_1

The goal is to be in front of grey_ball_1, which is in room_4.

There are additional constraints:
1. yellow_door_1 must be unlocked at some point
2. We must hold grey_ball_1 at some point
3. We must be in front of red_box_1 at some point

Now, let's plan our approach:

1. First, we need to unlock some doors to navigate between rooms.
2. We need to navigate to room_1 to get in front of red_box_1 (as per constraint 3).
3. We need to unlock yellow_door_1 (as per constraint 1).
4. We need to pick up grey_ball_1 (as per constraint 2).
5. Finally, we need to be in front of grey_ball_1 (the main goal).

Starting from room_4, we first need to be in front of a door (to unlock it), then move to other rooms, and so on. 

I'll walkthrough this step by step:

1. We start in room_4. We need to move in front of a door to unlock it. We'll start with the door connecting room_4 and room_2 (purple_door_1), so we can move to room_2.
2. From room_2, we can go to room_1 via grey_door_1 after unlocking it.
3. In room_1, we'll get in front of red_box_1 (constraint 3).
4. While in room_1, we'll unlock yellow_door_1 (constraint 1).
5. Then, we'll navigate back to room_4 to pick up grey_ball_1 (constraint 2).
6. Finally, we'll drop grey_ball_1 and go in front of it (the main goal).

Let's write the plan:

We start in room_4. We want to unlock one of the doors. Since purple_door_1 connects room_4 and room_2, let's start by unlocking it.

1. `gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_2` - Go in front of the door to room_2.
2. `toggle purple_door_1` - Unlock the door.
3. `gotoroom room_4 room_2 purple_door_1` - Go to room_2.

Now we're in room_2 and want to go to room_1. We need to unlock grey_door_1.

4. `gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_1` - Go in front of the door to room_1.
5. `toggle grey_door_1` - Unlock the door.
6. `gotoroom room_2 room_1 grey_door_1` - Go to room_1.

Now we're in room_1. We need to satisfy constraint 3 by being in front of red_box_1.

7. `gotoobject red_box_1 room_1` - Go in front of red_box_1.

Now we need to satisfy constraint 1 by unlocking yellow_door_1.

8. `gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3` - Go in front of the door to room_3.
9. `toggle yellow_door_1` - Unlock the door.

(At this point, we've satisfied constraints 1 and 3)

Now, let's go back to room_4 to pick up grey_ball_1. The shortest path is via room_2.

10. `gotoroom room_1 room_2 grey_door_1` - Go to room_2.
11. `gotoroom room_2 room_4 purple_door_1` - Go to room_4.

Now we pick up grey_ball_1 to satisfy constraint 2.

12. `gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_4` - Go in front of grey_ball_1.
13. `pick grey_ball_1 room_4` - Pick up grey_ball_1.

Let's drop it to be in front of it again (as per the goal).

14. `gotoempty` - Go in front of an empty position.
15. `drop grey_ball_1 room_4` - Drop grey_ball_1.

(At this point, we've satisfied constraint 2 and have achieved the goal).

But wait, I realized there's a simpler solution. If grey_ball_1 is already in room_4, and we're also in room_4, we can simply go directly to it. Let's revisit the task.

Reading the initial state again:
- We are in room_4.
- grey_ball_1 is also in room_4.
- All doors are locked.

Given the goal: "There is a ball v such that 'The following conditions are all true: 'v is grey', 'you are in front of v'"

Actually, we only need to satisfy constraints 1, 2, and 3, and then finally be in front of grey_ball_1.

Let's replan:

We start in room_4 with grey_ball_1. We can first satisfy constraint 2 by picking up grey_ball_1, and then come back to it later.

1. `gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_4` - Go in front of grey_ball_1.
2. `pick grey_ball_1 room_4` - Pick up grey_ball_1.

Now, we need to satisfy constraints 1 and 3. For this, we need to navigate to room_1 via room_2 or room_3. Let's go via room_2.

3. `gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_2` - Go in front of the door to room_2.
4. `toggle purple_door_1` - Unlock the door.
5. `gotoroom room_4 room_2 purple_door_1` - Go to room_2.
6. `gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_1` - Go in front of the door to room_1.
7. `toggle grey_door_1` - Unlock the door.
8. `gotoroom room_2 room_1 grey_door_1` - Go to room_1.

Now we're in room_1. We'll satisfy constraint 3 by being in front of red_box_1.

9. `gotoobject red_box_1 room_1` - Go in front of red_box_1.

Next, we need to satisfy constraint 1 by unlocking yellow_door_1.

10. `gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3` - Go in front of the door to room_3.
11. `toggle yellow_door_1` - Unlock the door.

(At this point, we've satisfied constraints 1 and 3)

Now, let's go back to room_4 and drop grey_ball_1. Since yellow_door_1 is unlocked, we can go via room_3.

12. `gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1` - Go to room_3.
13. `gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_4` - Go in front of the door to room_4.
14. `toggle red_door_1` - Unlock the door.
15. `gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_1` - Go to room_4.

Now we're back in room_4 and holding grey_ball_1. Let's drop it and then be in front of it.

16. `gotoempty` - Go in front of an empty position.
17. `drop grey_ball_1 room_4` - Drop grey_ball_1.
18. `gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_4` - Go in front of grey_ball_1.

However, I notice I made a mistake. After dropping grey_ball_1, we're already in front of it (according to the effects of the drop action: "you are in front of x"). So, the last step is unnecessary.

Let's revise the final part:

16. `gotoempty` - Go in front of an empty position.
17. `drop grey_ball_1 room_4` - Drop grey_ball_1. (At this point, we've achieved the goal).

However, I need to double-check the effects of the drop action. It does say "you are in front of x" after dropping, so the goal should be satisfied immediately after dropping grey_ball_1.

Ok let me take a step back and rethink:

If I understand the actions correctly, we might not need to drop grey_ball_1 after picking it up. The goal is "There is a ball v such that 'The following conditions are all true: 'v is grey', 'you are in front of v'", and when we pick up grey_ball_1, we're no longer in front of it (as per action effect). So after fulfilling all constraints we need to go back to grey_ball_1 if it's still in room_4 or drop it if we're holding it.

So, let's think through the plan once more:

1. We start in room_4.
2. We need to satisfy constraint 2 by picking up grey_ball_1, unlock yellow_door_1 for constraint 1, be in front of red_box_1 for constraint 3, and finally be in front of grey_ball_1 for the goal.

Let's start:

1. `gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_4` - Go in front of grey_ball_1.
2. `pick grey_ball_1 room_4` - Pick up grey_ball_1. (This satisfies constraint 2)

Now, we need to navigate to room_1 via room_2 or room_3 to satisfy constraints 1 and 3. Let's go via room_2.

3. `gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_2` - Go in front of the door to room_2.
4. `toggle purple_door_1` - Unlock the door.
5. `gotoroom room_4 room_2 purple_door_1` - Go to room_2.
6. `gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_1` - Go in front of the door to room_1.
7. `toggle grey_door_1` - Unlock the door.
8. `gotoroom room_2 room_1 grey_door_1` - Go to room_1.

Now we're in room_1. We'll satisfy constraint 3 by being in front of red_box_1.

9. `gotoobject red_box_1 room_1` - Go in front of red_box_1. (This satisfies constraint 3)

Next, we need to satisfy constraint 1 by unlocking yellow_door_1.

10. `gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3` - Go in front of the door to room_3.
11. `toggle yellow_door_1` - Unlock the door. (This satisfies constraint 1)

(At this point, we've satisfied all three constraints)

Now, to achieve the goal, we need to be in front of grey_ball_1. But we're currently holding it. According to the action descriptions, after dropping an object, we're in front of it. So, we need to find an empty spot and drop grey_ball_1.

12. `gotoempty` - Go in front of an empty position.
13. `drop grey_ball_1 room_1` - Drop grey_ball_1.

(At this point, we've achieved the goal)

Actually, I was overthinking this. The goal is to be in front of a grey ball. We're in room_4, and grey_ball_1 is also in room_4. We just need to go in front of it.

Let me trace through one more solution from the beginning:

1. We start in room_4 with grey_ball_1, which is grey.
2. We need to satisfy constraint 2 by picking up grey_ball_1, unlock yellow_door_1 for constraint 1, be in front of red_box_1 for constraint 3, and finally be in front of grey_ball_1 for the goal.

Let's also recall the effects of the actions drop and pick:
The effect of the pick action is "you are no longer in front of x" after picking x.
The effect of the drop action is "you are in front of x" after dropping x.

Given these, let's plan:

1. `gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_4` - Go in front of grey_ball_1.
2. `pick grey_ball_1 room_4` - Pick up grey_ball_1. (This satisfies constraint 2)

Now, we need to navigate to room_1 via room_2 or room_3 to satisfy constraints 1 and 3. Let's go via room_2.

3. `gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_2` - Go in front of the door to room_2.
4. `toggle purple_door_1` - Unlock the door.
5. `gotoroom room_4 room_2 purple_door_1` - Go to room_2.
6. `gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_1` - Go in front of the door to room_1.
7. `toggle grey_door_1` - Unlock the door.
8. `gotoroom room_2 room_1 grey_door_1` - Go to room_1.

Now we're in room_1. We'll satisfy constraint 3 by being in front of red_box_1.

9. `gotoobject red_box_1 room_1` - Go in front of red_box_1. (This satisfies constraint 3)

Next, we need to satisfy constraint 1 by unlocking yellow_door_1.

10. `gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3` - Go in front of the door to room_3.
11. `toggle yellow_door_1` - Unlock the door. (This satisfies constraint 1)

(At this point, we've satisfied all three constraints)

Now, to achieve the goal, we need to be in front of grey_ball_1. But we're currently holding it. According to the action descriptions, after dropping an object, we're in front of it. So, we need to find an empty spot and drop grey_ball_1.

12. `gotoempty` - Go in front of an empty position.
13. `drop grey_ball_1 room_1` - Drop grey_ball_1.

(At this point, we've achieved the goal)

Actually, the goal was quite explicit to be in front of a gray ball, which is grey_ball_1.

I think the above plan is correct. Let me double-check:

- Constraint 1: "yellow_door_1 is not locked" - satisfied in step 11.
- Constraint 2: "you are holding grey_ball_1" - satisfied in step 2.
- Constraint 3: "you are in front of red_box_1" - satisfied in step 9.
- Goal: "There is a ball v such that 'The following conditions are all true: 'v is grey', 'you are in front of v'" - satisfied in step 13, as after dropping grey_ball_1, we are in front of it.

We dropped grey_ball_1 in room_1, and we are in front of it after dropping (as per the effect of the drop action). grey_ball_1 is grey, so the goal is satisfied. The plan is optimal given the constraints we have.

Actually, I'm not sure if we need to drop grey_ball_1 in room_1 to satisfy the goal. Let me think through this once more.

The goal is: "There is a ball v such that 'The following conditions are all true: 'v is grey', 'you are in front of v'"

And from the initial state, "grey_ball_1 is grey". 

Hmm, looking at this again, I realized we initially start in room_4, and grey_ball_1 is also in room_4. So, a simpler plan might be:

1. `gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_4` - Go in front of grey_ball_1. (This already satisfies the goal, but we still have the constraints)

2. `pick grey_ball_1 room_4` - Pick up grey_ball_1. (This satisfies constraint 2, but we are no longer in front of grey_ball_1, so the goal is no longer satisfied)

(Now we need to satisfy constraints 1 and 3)

3. `gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_2` - Go in front of the door to room_2.
4. `toggle purple_door_1` - Unlock the door.
5. `gotoroom room_4 room_2 purple_door_1` - Go to room_2.
6. `gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_1` - Go in front of the door to room_1.
7. `toggle grey_door_1` - Unlock the door.
8. `gotoroom room_2 room_1 grey_door_1` - Go to room_1.
9. `gotoobject red_box_1 room_1` - Go in front of red_box_1. (This satisfies constraint 3)
10. `gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3` - Go in front of the door to room_3.
11. `toggle yellow_door_1` - Unlock the door. (This satisfies constraint 1)

Now, we need to re-satisfy the goal by being in front of grey_ball_1. Since we are holding grey_ball_1, we need to drop it to be in front of it.

12. `gotoempty` - Go in front of an empty position.
13. `drop grey_ball_1 room_1` - Drop grey_ball_1. (This re-satisfies the goal)

Ok, I think this is my final answer:

1. `gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_4` - Go in front of grey_ball_1.
2. `pick grey_ball_1 room_4` - Pick up grey_ball_1. (This satisfies constraint 2)
3. `gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_2` - Go in front of the door to room_2.
4. `toggle purple_door_1` - Unlock the door.
5. `gotoroom room_4 room_2 purple_door_1` - Go to room_2.
6. `gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_1` - Go in front of the door to room_1.
7. `toggle grey_door_1` - Unlock the door.
8. `gotoroom room_2 room_1 grey_door_1` - Go to room_1.
9. `gotoobject red_box_1 room_1` - Go in front of red_box_1. (This satisfies constraint 3)
10. `gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3` - Go in front of the door to room_3.
11. `toggle yellow_door_1` - Unlock the door. (This satisfies constraint 1)
12. `gotoempty` - Go in front of an empty position.
13. `drop grey_ball_1 room_1` - Drop grey_ball_1. (This re-satisfies the goal)
