Let me break down the problem, understand the initial state, the goal, and the constraints:

Initial State:
1. We're in room_1
2. In room_1: yellow_ball_1, yellow_ball_2, purple_ball_1
3. In room_3: yellow_box_1, green_ball_1
4. In room_4: purple_ball_2, green_box_1, purple_ball_3
5. All doors are locked (purple_door_1, blue_door_1, green_door_1, yellow_door_1)
6. Room connections:
   - room_1 and room_2 via purple_door_1
   - room_1 and room_3 via blue_door_1
   - room_2 and room_4 via green_door_1
   - room_3 and room_4 via yellow_door_1
7. We're not holding any object

Goal:
1. We need to pick up a purple ball. There are three purple balls:
   - purple_ball_1 in room_1
   - purple_ball_2 in room_4
   - purple_ball_3 in room_4

Constraints:
1. At some point, yellow_ball_1 should be in room_3 and we should be in room_3
2. At some point, we should hold an object
3. Before holding any object, we should either be in front of yellow_door_1 or in room_4
4. At some point, green_door_1 should be unlocked and we should be in front of green_ball_1

Now, let's think about a plan to achieve the goal while respecting the constraints:

1. First, we need to comply with constraint 3: before holding any object, we need to either be in front of yellow_door_1 or in room_4.

2. Considering constraint 4: we need to unlock green_door_1 and be in front of green_ball_1, which is in room_3.

3. Considering constraint 1: we need to bring yellow_ball_1 from room_1 to room_3 and be in room_3 at some point.

4. The goal is to hold a purple ball. We have purple_ball_1 in room_1, and purple_ball_2 and purple_ball_3 in room_4.

Here's a potential plan:

1. To satisfy constraint 3, let's go to room_3 first, which has yellow_door_1 connecting it to room_4.
   a. We need to unlock blue_door_1 connecting room_1 and room_3.
   b. Go in front of blue_door_1, toggle it, then go to room_3.

2. Now, we're in room_3. Let's go in front of yellow_door_1 to satisfy constraint 3.

3. After that, we can return to room_1, pick up a purple ball (purple_ball_1), and complete the goal.

4. But wait, we also need to satisfy constraints 1 and 4. Let's revise:
   a. Start in room_1, go in front of blue_door_1, toggle to unlock it.
   b. Go to room_3, go in front of yellow_door_1 (satisfying constraint 3).
   c. Go in front of green_ball_1 while in room_3 (part of constraint 4).
   d. Go back to room_1, pick up yellow_ball_1.
   e. Return to room_3 with yellow_ball_1 (satisfying constraint 1).
   f. Drop yellow_ball_1 in room_3.
   g. We need to go to room_2, then to room_4 through green_door_1, but for that, we need to unlock green_door_1 (part of constraint 4).
   h. Go back to room_1, then to room_2 through purple_door_1 (need to unlock it).
   i. In room_2, go in front of green_door_1, toggle to unlock it (satisfying constraint 4 completely).
   j. Go to room_4, pick purple_ball_2 or purple_ball_3 (achieving the goal).

Wait, there's an issue with the above plan. According to the constraints, before holding any object, we need to be in front of yellow_door_1 or in room_4. But we're planning to pick up yellow_ball_1 in room_1 before going to room_4. Let's revise:

1. Start in room_1, go in front of blue_door_1, toggle to unlock it.
2. Go to room_3.
3. In room_3, go in front of yellow_door_1 (satisfying constraint 3).
4. Toggle yellow_door_1 to unlock it.
5. Go to room_4.
6. In room_4, pick up purple_ball_2 or purple_ball_3 (achieving the goal, and also satisfying constraint 2).

Wait, this doesn't satisfy constraints 1 and 4. Let's refine the plan:

Actually, the constraints are a bit complex, and I'm trying to fulfill them all together, which is making it challenging. Let's approach this one constraint at a time:

Constraint 3 says that before holding any object, we should be in front of yellow_door_1 or in room_4. This means we can't pick up any object until we've been in one of these places.

Constraint 1 requires yellow_ball_1 to be in room_3 and us to be in room_3 at some point. This means we need to move yellow_ball_1 from room_1 to room_3.

Constraint 4 requires green_door_1 to be unlocked and us to be in front of green_ball_1 at some point. green_ball_1 is in room_3.

The goal is to hold a purple ball. We have purple_ball_1 in room_1, purple_ball_2 and purple_ball_3 in room_4.

Let's refine the plan:

1. Start in room_1, go in front of blue_door_1, toggle to unlock it.
2. Go to room_3.
3. In room_3, go in front of yellow_door_1 (satisfying constraint 3).
4. Go in front of green_ball_1 (part of constraint 4).
5. Go back to room_1.
6. In room_1, go in front of purple_door_1, toggle to unlock it.
7. Go to room_2.
8. In room_2, go in front of green_door_1, toggle to unlock it (satisfying constraint 4 completely).
9. Go back to room_1.
10. In room_1, pick up yellow_ball_1 (we've satisfied constraint 3, so we can pick up objects now).
11. Go to room_3, drop yellow_ball_1 (satisfying constraint 1).
12. Go back to room_1.
13. In room_1, pick up purple_ball_1 (achieving the goal).

This satisfies all constraints:
- Constraint 1: yellow_ball_1 is in room_3 and we are in room_3.
- Constraint 2: We hold an object (yellow_ball_1, and later purple_ball_1).
- Constraint 3: Before holding any object, we're in front of yellow_door_1.
- Constraint 4: green_door_1 is unlocked and we're in front of green_ball_1.

Let's add specific actions based on the available actions in the domain:

```
gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_3
toggle blue_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_1
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_4
gotoobject green_ball_1 room_3
gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_1
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2
toggle purple_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1
gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4
toggle green_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1
gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_1
pick yellow_ball_1 room_1
gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_1
gotoempty
drop yellow_ball_1 room_3
gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_1
gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_1
pick purple_ball_1 room_1
```

Hmm, actually I notice there's a flaw in this plan. Specifically, I'm not sure that the preconditions for picking up an object allow us to, essentially, go in front of an object and immediately pick it up. The "pick" action requires us to be in the same room as the object, not necessarily in front of it. So let's adjusted the actions:

```
gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_3
toggle blue_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_1
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_4
gotoobject green_ball_1 room_3
gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_1
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2
toggle purple_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1
gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4
toggle green_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1
gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_1
pick yellow_ball_1 room_1
gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_1
gotoempty
drop yellow_ball_1 room_3
gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_1
gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_1
pick purple_ball_1 room_1
```

Let me double-check this plan against the constraints and the goal:

1. Goal: We end up holding purple_ball_1.
2. Constraint 1: We have yellow_ball_1 in room_3 and we are in room_3.
3. Constraint 2: We hold an object (yellow_ball_1, and later purple_ball_1).
4. Constraint 3: Before holding any object, we go in front of yellow_door_1 (which connects room_3 and room_4).
5. Constraint 4: We unlock green_door_1 and go in front of green_ball_1.

The plan looks good, but I'm actually missing something for constraint 3. It requires that before holding any object, we should be in front of yellow_door_1 or in room_4. We've gone in front of yellow_door_1, but we haven't actually been in room_4. Let's adjust the plan to ensure we satisfy constraint 3:

```
gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_3
toggle blue_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_1
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_4
toggle yellow_door_1
gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_1
gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_1
gotoobject green_ball_1 room_3
gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_1
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2
toggle purple_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1
gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4
toggle green_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1
gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_1
pick yellow_ball_1 room_1
gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_1
gotoempty
drop yellow_ball_1 room_3
gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_1
gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_1
pick purple_ball_1 room_1
```

Wait, I'm overthinking constraint 3. It says "If you are holding an object, then before holding the object, we should be either in front of yellow_door_1 or in room_4". We do go in front of yellow_door_1 before picking up any object, so we're good.

Let's double-check the actions against the preconditions:

- "gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_3": We're in room_1, which is connected to room_3 via blue_door_1. The door isn't blocked. This is valid.
- "toggle blue_door_1": We're in front of blue_door_1, so we can toggle it. After this, blue_door_1 is unlocked.
- "gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_1": We're in room_1, adjacent to room_3, and the door is unlocked. This is valid. After this, we're in room_3.
- "gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_4": We're in room_3, which is connected to room_4 via yellow_door_1. The door isn't blocked. This is valid.

Wait, I think I've been taking the constraint wording wrong, so let's clarify it:

Constraint 3: "If "you are holding some object" holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: "At least one of the following conditions is true: "you are in front of yellow_door_1", "you are in room_4""

So this is saying that before holding any object, I need to have been in front of yellow_door_1 or in room_4 at some point. I don't necessarily need to go directly from one of these states to picking up an object.

So, our plan does satisfy this constraint. We go in front of yellow_door_1 before picking up any object.

Let's continue checking:

- "gotoobject green_ball_1 room_3": We're in room_3, which has green_ball_1. This is valid.
- "gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_1": We're in room_3, adjacent to room_1, and the door is unlocked. This is valid. After this, we're in room_1.
- "gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2": We're in room_1, which is connected to room_2 via purple_door_1. The door isn't blocked. This is valid.
- "toggle purple_door_1": We're in front of purple_door_1, so we can toggle it. After this, purple_door_1 is unlocked.
- "gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1": We're in room_1, adjacent to room_2, and the door is unlocked. This is valid. After this, we're in room_2.
- "gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4": We're in room_2, which is connected to room_4 via green_door_1. The door isn't blocked. This is valid.
- "toggle green_door_1": We're in front of green_door_1, so we can toggle it. After this, green_door_1 is unlocked.
- "gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1": We're in room_2, adjacent to room_1, and the door is unlocked. This is valid. After this, we're in room_1.
- "gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_1": We're in room_1, which has yellow_ball_1. This is valid.
- "pick yellow_ball_1 room_1": We're in front of yellow_ball_1, our hands are empty, and the object is in the room. This is valid. After this, we're holding yellow_ball_1.
- "gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_1": We're in room_1, adjacent to room_3, and the door is unlocked. This is valid. After this, we're in room_3 with yellow_ball_1.
- "gotoempty": We go in front of an empty position. This is valid.
- "drop yellow_ball_1 room_3": We're in room_3, we're carrying yellow_ball_1, and we're in front of an empty position. This is valid. After this, yellow_ball_1 is in room_3 and we're in front of it.
- "gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_1": We're in room_3, adjacent to room_1, and the door is unlocked. This is valid. After this, we're in room_1.
- "gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_1": We're in room_1, which has purple_ball_1. This is valid.
- "pick purple_ball_1 room_1": We're in front of purple_ball_1, our hands are empty, and the object is in the room. This is valid. After this, we're holding purple_ball_1, which satisfies the goal.

The plan seems to satisfy all the constraints and achieves the goal of picking up a purple ball. Let's finalize our plan with the complete sequence of actions:

```
gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_3
toggle blue_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_1
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_4
gotoobject green_ball_1 room_3
gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_1
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2
toggle purple_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1
gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4
toggle green_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1
gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_1
pick yellow_ball_1 room_1
gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_1
gotoempty
drop yellow_ball_1 room_3
gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_1
gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_1
pick purple_ball_1 room_1
```

Upon review, I just realized we can have a more optimal plan:

1. From room_1, unlock blue_door_1 to get to room_3.
2. In room_3, go in front of green_ball_1 (part of constraint 4) and yellow_door_1 (for constraint 3).
3. Go back to room_1, get yellow_ball_1, and bring it to room_3 (for constraint 1).
4. Go back to room_1, pick up purple_ball_1 (achieving the goal).

But for constraint 4, green_door_1 should be unlocked...

Actually, let me just come up with a new plan that addresses all the constraints:

1. From room_1, unlock blue_door_1, go to room_3.
2. In room_3, go in front of yellow_door_1 (for constraint 3) and then in front of green_ball_1 (part of constraint 4).
3. Go back to room_1, unlock purple_door_1, go to room_2.
4. In room_2, unlock green_door_1 (for constraint 4).
5. Go back to room_1, pick up yellow_ball_1, bring it to room_3, and drop it (for constraint 1).
6. Go back to room_1, pick up purple_ball_1 (achieving the goal).

This should be an optimal sequence of actions:

```
gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_3
toggle blue_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_1
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_4
gotoobject green_ball_1 room_3
gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_1
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2
toggle purple_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1
gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4
toggle green_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1
gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_1
pick yellow_ball_1 room_1
gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_1
gotoempty
drop yellow_ball_1 room_3
gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_1
gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_1
pick purple_ball_1 room_1
```

Actually, let me see if I can make this even more efficient...

Here's a slightly different plan:

1. From room_1, unlock blue_door_1, go to room_3.
2. In room_3, go in front of yellow_door_1 (for constraint 3).
3. Toggle yellow_door_1 (to simplify the rest of the plan).
4. Go in front of green_ball_1 (part of constraint 4).
5. Go back to room_1, unlock purple_door_1, go to room_2.
6. In room_2, unlock green_door_1 (for constraint 4).
7. Go back to room_1, pick up yellow_ball_1, bring it to room_3, and drop it (for constraint 1).
8. Pick purple_ball_1 from room_1 (achieving the goal).

Actually, we don't need to unlock yellow_door_1. We only need to be in front of it.

I think this plan is already quite optimal. Let's stick with:

```
gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_3
toggle blue_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_1
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_4
gotoobject green_ball_1 room_3
gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_1
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2
toggle purple_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1
gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4
toggle green_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1
gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_1
pick yellow_ball_1 room_1
gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_1
gotoempty
drop yellow_ball_1 room_3
gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_1
gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_1
pick purple_ball_1 room_1
```

Actually, I realized that picking up yellow_ball_1 and dropping it in room_3 is just to satisfy the constraint of yellow_ball_1 being in room_3. We could actually pick up purple_ball_1 first, which would achieve the goal, and then move yellow_ball_1 to room_3 to satisfy the constraint.

But that would violate the constraint:
"The following expression must hold in at least one state: The following conditions are all true: yellow_ball_1 is in room_3, you are in room_3"

Because if we're holding purple_ball_1 when we drop yellow_ball_1 in room_3, then we won't satisfy the condition "you are in room_3 and yellow_ball_1 is in room_3" at the same time.

So, I think the current plan is optimal. Let's check once more:

1. We start in room_1.
2. We unlock blue_door_1 and go to room_3.
3. We go in front of yellow_door_1 (satisfying constraint 3) and green_ball_1 (part of constraint 4).
4. We go back to room_1, unlock purple_door_1, and go to room_2.
5. We unlock green_door_1 (satisfying constraint 4 completely).
6. We go back to room_1, pick up yellow_ball_1, bring it to room_3, and drop it (satisfying constraint 1).
7. We go back to room_1 and pick up purple_ball_1 (satisfying the goal).

All good, so the sequence of actions we are using is:
```
gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_3
toggle blue_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_1
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_4
gotoobject green_ball_1 room_3
gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_1
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2
toggle purple_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1
gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4
toggle green_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1
gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_1
pick yellow_ball_1 room_1
gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_1
gotoempty
drop yellow_ball_1 room_3
gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_1
gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_1
pick purple_ball_1 room_1
```

That's our final plan.

Actually, I think I found another optimization: After we drop yellow_ball_1 in room_3, we can just go ahead and pick up purple_ball_1 from room_1. We don't need to go back to room_1 first.

Sorry for the confusion. I'm starting to overthink this. Let's revise the sequence of actions once more:

```
gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_3
toggle blue_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_1
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_4
gotoobject green_ball_1 room_3
gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_1
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2
toggle purple_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1
gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4
toggle green_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1
gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_1
pick yellow_ball_1 room_1
gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_1
gotoempty
drop yellow_ball_1 room_3
gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_1
gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_1
pick purple_ball_1 room_1
```

Actually, I'm being silly—the end of the plan is:

```
...
gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_1
gotoempty
drop yellow_ball_1 room_3
gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_1
gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_1
pick purple_ball_1 room_1
```

Which is already what I had. No further optimization needed.

Let me double check everything:

Initial State:
1. We're in room_1
2. In room_1: yellow_ball_1, yellow_ball_2, purple_ball_1
3. In room_3: yellow_box_1, green_ball_1
4. In room_4: purple_ball_2, green_box_1, purple_ball_3
5. All doors are locked (purple_door_1, blue_door_1, green_door_1, yellow_door_1)
6. Room connections:
   - room_1 and room_2 via purple_door_1
   - room_1 and room_3 via blue_door_1
   - room_2 and room_4 via green_door_1
   - room_3 and room_4 via yellow_door_1
7. We're not holding any object

Goal:
1. We need to pick up a purple ball. There are three purple balls:
   - purple_ball_1 in room_1
   - purple_ball_2 in room_4
   - purple_ball_3 in room_4

Constraints:
1. At some point, yellow_ball_1 should be in room_3 and we should be in room_3
2. At some point, we should hold an object
3. Before holding any object, we should either be in front of yellow_door_1 or in room_4
4. At some point, green_door_1 should be unlocked and we should be in front of green_ball_1

Our plan:

1. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_3
2. toggle blue_door_1
3. gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_1
4. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_4
5. gotoobject green_ball_1 room_3
6. gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_1
7. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2
8. toggle purple_door_1
9. gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1
10. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4
11. toggle green_door_1
12. gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1
13. gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_1
14. pick yellow_ball_1 room_1
15. gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_1
16. gotoempty
17. drop yellow_ball_1 room_3
18. gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_1
19. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_1
20. pick purple_ball_1 room_1

Let's verify this plan against the constraints:

1. Constraint 1: yellow_ball_1 is in room_3 and we are in room_3. This happens after step 17.
2. Constraint 2: We hold an object. This happens at steps 14 and 20.
3. Constraint 3: Before holding any object, we go in front of yellow_door_1. This happens at step 4, which is before we hold any object at step 14.
4. Constraint 4: green_door_1 is unlocked and we go in front of green_ball_1. green_door_1 is unlocked at step 11, and we go in front of green_ball_1 at step 5.
5. Goal: We pick up a purple ball. This happens at step 20.

The plan satisfies all the constraints and achieves the goal. 

Upon more thinking, though, there's one more optimization I can make. After we toggle green_door_1, we go back to room_1 via purple_door_1. However, we could go directly to room_4 via green_door_1. This would satisfy the constraint of being in room_4 before holding any object, but it would complicate the rest of the plan. Let's stick with the current plan, as it's already optimal in terms of the number of steps.

The final sequence of actions is:

```
gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_3
toggle blue_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_1
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_4
gotoobject green_ball_1 room_3
gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_1
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2
toggle purple_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1
gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4
toggle green_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1
gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_1
pick yellow_ball_1 room_1
gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_1
gotoempty
drop yellow_ball_1 room_3
gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_1
gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_1
pick purple_ball_1 room_1
```

This plan satisfies all the constraints and achieves the goal of picking up a purple ball.
