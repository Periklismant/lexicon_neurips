Okay, let's try to figure out this planning problem. So the goal is to have a purple ball being held by the agent. The initial state is in room_1, and there are several balls and boxes in different rooms. All doors are locked initially, which complicates movement. Also, there are some constraints to satisfy.

First, I need to get a purple ball. The purple balls are purple_ball_1 in room_1, purple_ball_2 in room_4, and purple_ball_3 in room_4. So the closest one is purple_ball_1 in room_1. Wait, but maybe I can't get that because of the constraints. Let me check the constraints.

The constraints are:
1. At some point, yellow_ball_1 must be in room_3 and the agent is in room_3.
2. At some point, the agent is holding an object.
3. If the agent is holding an object, then there must be an earlier state where they are in front of yellow_door_1 or in room_4.
4. At some point, green_door_1 is unlocked and the agent is in front of green_ball_1.

So, the plan must include actions that meet these constraints. Let's break them down.

First, the goal is to hold a purple ball. Let's see the possible purple balls. The ones in room_4 would require going through doors that are locked. Since all doors start locked, the agent needs to unlock them. But to unlock a door, the agent must be in front of it and toggle it. But to get in front of a door, the agent must be in a room connected by that door and there's no object blocking the door. Wait, the preconditions for gotodoor are that the agent is in a room connected by the door and no object is blocking the position in front of the door.

Looking at the initial state, the agent is in room_1. The doors connected to room_1 are purple_door_1 (connects room_1 and room_2) and blue_door_1 (connects room_1 and room_3). Both are locked. So the agent needs to unlock these doors to move.

But the problem is that to toggle a door, the agent must be in front of it. So the agent needs to go to the door first. But to go to a door, the door's position must not be blocked. Are there any objects blocking the doors in the initial state?

In room_1, there are yellow_ball_1, yellow_ball_2, and purple_ball_1. The doors in room_1 are purple_door_1 (to room_2) and blue_door_1 (to room_3). Are any of the objects in front of the doors? The problem statement says that objects can block the position in front of a door. But in the initial state, the objects in room_1 are just present, but their positions aren't specified. Wait, the problem's initial state lists the objects in each room but doesn't mention their exact positions. So perhaps the assumption is that unless specified, the doors are not blocked. Because the "goto door" action's precondition is that there's no object blocking the position in front of d in the current room. So maybe the doors are not blocked unless there's an object in front of them. Since the initial state doesn't mention any such blocking, the agent can go to the doors.

So, the agent can go to the doors in room_1 (purple_door_1 and blue_door_1), toggle them to unlock, then move through.

But let's look at the constraints. The fourth constraint requires that at some state, green_door_1 is unlocked and the agent is in front of green_ball_1. Green_ball_1 is in room_3. Green_door_1 connects room_2 and room_4. So the agent must unlock green_door_1 and then be in front of green_ball_1. But green_ball_1 is in room_3. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, no, green_ball_1 is in room_3. So to be in front of green_ball_1, the agent must be in room_3. But green_door_1 is between room_2 and room_4. So how does that constraint work? The agent needs to have green_door_1 unlocked and be in front of green_ball_1. So maybe the agent unlocks green_door_1 (but that's between room_2 and room_4), but then goes to room_3, where green_ball_1 is. So that requires moving from room_1 to room_3 via blue_door_1, then perhaps moving to room_4 via yellow_door_1, which is connected between room_3 and room_4. But yellow_door_1 is initially locked. Hmm.

Wait, let's re-express the fourth constraint: in some state, green_door_1 is unlocked and the agent is in front of green_ball_1. Green_ball_1 is in room_3. So the agent needs to be in room_3 and in front of green_ball_1, and at that moment, green_door_1 (which connects room_2 and room_4) must be unlocked. But how can green_door_1's state affect the agent being in room_3? The agent can't be in front of green_ball_1 unless they are in room_3. So perhaps the agent needs to unlock green_door_1 at some point before or after, and then at some point when they are in room_3 in front of green_ball_1, the green_door_1 is still unlocked.

So the steps might involve unlocking green_door_1, then going to room_3, then going in front of green_ball_1. But how to unlock green_door_1? To unlock green_door_1, the agent needs to be in front of it. green_door_1 is in room_2 and room_4. So the agent must be in room_2 or room_4 to access green_door_1. But to get to room_2 from room_1, they need to go through purple_door_1. Purple_door_1 is locked initially. So the agent can go to purple_door_1 in room_1, toggle it (unlock), then go through to room_2. Then in room_2, go to green_door_1 (since room_2 and room_4 are connected via green_door_1), toggle it (unlock). Then later, when the agent is in room_3 (from room_1 via blue_door_1, perhaps), and in front of green_ball_1, the green_door_1 must be unlocked. So during the plan, after unlocking green_door_1, the agent can go to room_3, perhaps pick up green_ball_1, which would require being in front of it, thus satisfying the fourth constraint if green_door_1 is already unlocked.

But wait, the fourth constraint is that in some state, green_door_1 is not locked (i.e., unlocked) and the agent is in front of green_ball_1. So the agent must be in room_3 (since green_ball_1 is there) and green_door_1 must be unlocked. So during the plan, after unlocking green_door_1, the agent needs to be in room_3 and in front of green_ball_1. That could be after moving from room_2 to room_4 via green_door_1, then to room_3 via yellow_door_1, but that requires unlocking yellow_door_1 as well.

Alternatively, perhaps the agent can unlock blue_door_1 first, go to room_3, then later unlock green_door_1, but that requires going through room_2 and room_4. Let's try to outline possible steps.

First, the agent is in room_1. To unlock doors, they need to go in front of them and toggle.

Step 1: goto door purple_door_1 (from room_1 to room_2). Since the agent is in room_1, which is connected via purple_door_1. If there's no object blocking, then they can goto purple_door_1. Then toggle it to unlock.

But wait, the initial state says purple_door_1 is locked. So the steps would be:

1. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2
2. toggle purple_door_1 (now it's unlocked)
3. gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1 (move to room_2)
4. Now in room_2. Next, need to unlock green_door_1 which connects room_2 to room_4. So:

5. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4
6. toggle green_door_1 (unlocks it)
7. Now, can go to room_4 via green_door_1:
   gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1

Once in room_4, there's purple_ball_2 and purple_ball_3. But the agent needs to pick up a purple ball. However, the constraints also require that the agent must have, at some point, been in room_3 with yellow_ball_1. So maybe the agent needs to move yellow_ball_1 to room_3. Wait, the first constraint is that in some state, yellow_ball_1 is in room_3 and the agent is in room_3. But yellow_ball_1 is initially in room_1. So the agent needs to move yellow_ball_1 to room_3. That requires picking it up in room_1, then moving it to room_3. But how?

Wait, the agent starts in room_1. So first, perhaps:

In room_1:

- gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_1
- pick yellow_ball_1 room_1 (but wait, the agent can pick only if not holding anything. They start empty, so yes.)

But after picking, the agent is holding yellow_ball_1, which is yellow, not purple. But the goal is to hold a purple ball. However, the constraints require that at some point the agent is holding an object. So this action would satisfy constraint 2. However, constraint 3 says that if the agent is holding an object, there must be a prior state where they were in front of yellow_door_1 or in room_4. So if the agent picks up yellow_ball_1 in room_1, then they need to have been in front of yellow_door_1 or in room_4 before. But if they pick up yellow_ball_1 early on, they might not have visited those places yet. So that's a problem. So perhaps the agent needs to first go to room_4 or be in front of yellow_door_1 before picking up any object.

But how to get to room_4? The doors from room_1 are to room_2 (purple_door_1) and room_3 (blue_door_1). To get to room_4, from room_2 via green_door_1 or from room_3 via yellow_door_1. Both green_door_1 and yellow_door_1 are initially locked. So the agent needs to unlock those doors.

Alternatively, the agent can go through room_3. To get to room_3, unlock blue_door_1. So steps:

1. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_3
2. toggle blue_door_1 (unlocks)
3. gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_1 (now in room_3)
4. Now in room_3. yellow_box_1 and green_ball_1 are here. So to satisfy the first constraint (yellow_ball_1 in room_3 and agent in room_3), the agent must bring yellow_ball_1 to room_3. Since yellow_ball_1 starts in room_1, the agent needs to pick it up in room_1, then carry it to room_3. But to do that, they need to go back to room_1 from room_3. But the blue_door_1 is now unlocked. So steps could be:

From room_3:

5. gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_1 (back to room_1)
6. gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_1
7. pick yellow_ball_1 room_1
8. Then, return to room_3:

gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_1 (but while holding the ball, which is allowed as long as the door is unlocked. But the gotoroom action doesn't mention anything about holding objects, just the door being unlocked.

Once in room_3, drop the yellow_ball_1:

9. gotoempty (to get to an empty spot)
10. drop yellow_ball_1 room_3

Now, yellow_ball_1 is in room_3, and the agent is in room_3. So constraint 1 is satisfied here.

But when the agent picked up yellow_ball_1 (step 7), they were holding an object. According to constraint 3, before that, there must be a state where they were in front of yellow_door_1 or in room_4. However, up to step 7, the agent hasn't been to room_4 or in front of yellow_door_1. So this would violate the constraint. Therefore, this approach is invalid.

Hmm. So the agent must first either be in room_4 or in front of yellow_door_1 before picking up any object. So how can they get there?

Let's think again. The agent starts in room_1. The possible doors are purple_door_1 (to room_2) and blue_door_1 (to room_3). All doors are locked. To unlock, need to toggle.

Suppose the agent first unlocks blue_door_1 (room_1 to room_3):

1. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_3
2. toggle blue_door_1 (unlocks)
3. gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_1 (now in room_3)
4. Now in room_3. To get to yellow_door_1 (connecting room_3 and room_4), the agent can:

5. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_4
6. toggle yellow_door_1 (unlocks)
7. Now, the agent is in front of yellow_door_1. So if they pick up an object later, this state (step 5 or 6) would satisfy the constraint 3 (since they were in front of yellow_door_1). So if after step 6, they return to room_1, pick up an object, then constraint 3 is met.

But the problem is that after step 6, the agent is in room_3. To get back to room_1, they can go through blue_door_1 again. Then, in room_1, pick up yellow_ball_1. But when they pick it up (step 8), the constraint 3 is satisfied because they were in front of yellow_door_1 in step 5 or 6.

So let's outline this:

1. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_3
2. toggle blue_door_1
3. gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_1
4. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_4
5. toggle yellow_door_1
6. Now, agent is in front of yellow_door_1 in room_3. Then, they can return to room_1:

7. gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_1
8. Now in room_1. Then, go to yellow_ball_1:

9. gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_1
10. pick yellow_ball_1 room_1 → now holding an object. Before this (steps 4 or 5), they were in front of yellow_door_1, satisfying constraint 3.

Then, the agent needs to take yellow_ball_1 to room_3:

11. gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_1
12. drop yellow_ball_1 room_3 (need to go to empty spot first)
13. gotoempty
14. drop yellow_ball_1 room_3

Now, the first constraint is satisfied (yellow_ball_1 in room_3 and agent in room_3).

But the fourth constraint requires that in some state, green_door_1 is unlocked and the agent is in front of green_ball_1. Green_ball_1 is in room_3. So the agent needs to be in front of green_ball_1 in room_3 while green_door_1 is unlocked. green_door_1 connects room_2 and room_4. So the agent must unlock green_door_1 at some point, then go to room_3 and be in front of green_ball_1. How to do that?

To unlock green_door_1, the agent needs to be in room_2 or room_4. Let's think:

After step 14, the agent is in room_3. To unlock green_door_1, they need to go to room_2 or room_4. But from room_3, they can go to room_4 via yellow_door_1 (which is unlocked now). So:

15. gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_1 (now in room_4)
16. In room_4, they can go to green_door_1 (which connects to room_2). So:

17. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2
18. toggle green_door_1 (unlocks it)
19. Now, green_door_1 is unlocked. The agent is in room_4. To get to green_ball_1 (which is in room_3), they need to go back through yellow_door_1 to room_3.

20. gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_1
21. Now in room_3. Then, go to green_ball_1:

22. gotoobject green_ball_1 room_3
23. Now, in front of green_ball_1. At this point, green_door_1 is unlocked (from step 18). So this state satisfies constraint 4: green_door_1 is unlocked and agent is in front of green_ball_1.

Now, the agent can pick up green_ball_1 if needed, but the goal is to hold a purple ball. The purple balls in room_4 are purple_ball_2 and purple_ball_3. So after this, the agent needs to go to room_4 to pick one of them. But perhaps they can also pick a purple ball from room_1 (purple_ball_1). Let's see.

Wait, the agent is now in room_3, after step 23. They can go back to room_4 (step 20) and then to room_2 via green_door_1 (unlocked), then to room_1 via purple_door_1 (unlocked?), but purple_door_1 was unlocked earlier? Wait, no. The purple_door_1 was initially locked. Earlier steps only unlocked blue_door_1 and yellow_door_1. So purple_door_1 is still locked. So to get back to room_1 from room_2, the agent needs to unlock purple_door_1. So maybe:

After step 23 (in room_3 in front of green_ball_1), the agent needs to proceed to room_4 and then pick a purple ball. Let's continue:

24. Since agent is in room_3, they can go to room_4 via yellow_door_1 (already unlocked):

25. gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_1 (again, but perhaps they are already there. Wait, step 20 already moved them to room_3. Wait, step 20 is moving from room_4 to room_3. Then step 21-23 are in room_3. So step 24: from room_3, go to room_4 again.

24. gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_1 (now in room_4)
25. Now, in room_4. There's purple_ball_2 and purple_ball_3. The agent needs to pick one of them. But to pick, they need to be in the same room and not holding anything. Currently, after step 23, the agent may or may not be holding green_ball_1. Wait, no, after step 23, they are in front of green_ball_1, but haven't picked it up. So they are empty-handed. So to pick a purple ball in room_4:

25. gotoobject purple_ball_2 room_4
26. pick purple_ball_2 room_4 → now holding a purple ball. But need to check the constraints.

Wait, when the agent picks up purple_ball_2 (step 26), they are holding an object. According to constraint 3, before this, there must be a state where they were in front of yellow_door_1 or in room_4. The agent is in room_4 when picking, so the state of being in room_4 (step 24) satisfies the 'in room_4' part. So constraint 3 is satisfied.

But wait, constraint 3 says that if the agent is holding an object, there must be an earlier state where they were in front of yellow_door_1 or in room_4. When the agent picks up purple_ball_2 in room_4, they are in room_4, which satisfies the 'earlier state' because they were in room_4 in step 24. So that's okay.

So this seems to work. Let's check all constraints:

1. There must be a state where yellow_ball_1 is in room_3 and agent is in room_3. This was achieved in steps 14 (drop) and then agent is in room_3.

2. Agent must hold an object at some point. This happens when picking yellow_ball_1 (step 10) and purple_ball_2 (step 26). But the goal requires holding a purple ball, which is step 26.

3. For each time the agent holds an object, there must be an earlier state where they were in front of yellow_door_1 or in room_4.

- When holding yellow_ball_1 (step 10): the earlier state of being in front of yellow_door_1 was steps 4-5 (gotoroom to room_3, then gotodoor yellow_door_1 and toggle). So yes.

- When holding purple_ball_2 (step 26): the earlier state is being in room_4 (steps 24), which satisfies.

4. There must be a state where green_door_1 is unlocked and agent is in front of green_ball_1. This was achieved in step 23, where green_door_1 was unlocked in step 18, and agent is in front of green_ball_1 in room_3.

So all constraints are satisfied.

Now, let's put this all together into a step-by-step plan. Let's list all necessary actions:

1. Go to blue_door_1 in room_1.
2. Toggle it to unlock.
3. Go to room_3 through blue_door_1.
4. Go to yellow_door_1 in room_3.
5. Toggle it to unlock.
6. Return to room_1 via blue_door_1.
7. Go to yellow_ball_1 in room_1.
8. Pick yellow_ball_1 (now holding, but need to have been in front of yellow_door_1 or room_4 before. Steps 4-5 were in front of yellow_door_1, so that's okay.)
9. Go back to room_3 via blue_door_1.
10. Drop yellow_ball_1 in room_3 (after going to empty spot).
11. Go to room_4 via yellow_door_1.
12. Go to green_door_1 in room_4.
13. Toggle to unlock green_door_1.
14. Return to room_3 via yellow_door_1.
15. Go to green_ball_1 in room_3 (satisfies constraint 4 when green_door_1 is unlocked).
16. Go back to room_4 via yellow_door_1.
17. Go to purple_ball_2 in room_4.
18. Pick purple_ball_2 (now holding, and earlier in room_4, so constraint 3 is met).

But wait, some steps can be optimized. Let's see:

Let me outline the actual sequence:

1. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_3
2. toggle blue_door_1
3. gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_1
4. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_4
5. toggle yellow_door_1
6. gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_1 (back to room_1)
7. gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_1
8. pick yellow_ball_1 room_1
9. gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_1 (to room_3)
10. gotoempty room_3 (since after entering room, the agent is not in front of anything)
11. drop yellow_ball_1 room_3 (now constraint 1 is met)
12. gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_1 (to room_4)
13. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2
14. toggle green_door_1 (unlocks)
15. gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_1 (back to room_3)
16. gotoobject green_ball_1 room_3 (now in front of green_ball_1, green_door_1 is unlocked → constraint 4)
17. gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_1 (to room_4 again)
18. gotoobject purple_ball_2 room_4
19. pick purple_ball_2 room_4 (goal achieved)

But wait, step 10: after entering room_3 via blue_door_1 in step 9, the agent is no longer in front of anything. So to drop yellow_ball_1, they need to be in front of an empty spot. So step 10: gotoempty in room_3. Then drop. Then step 12 to room_4.

This sequence should satisfy all constraints and achieve the goal.

But let's check all steps:

- After step 8 (pick yellow_ball_1), the agent is holding an object. The prior state where they were in front of yellow_door_1 is step 4-5. So constraint 3 satisfied.

- In step 16, agent is in front of green_ball_1 in room_3 and green_door_1 is unlocked (step 14). So constraint 4 satisfied.

- Step 11: yellow_ball_1 is in room_3 and agent is in room_3 (step 11 after drop). So constraint 1 satisfied.

- Step 8 and 19: agent is holding an object (constraint 2).

The goal is to be holding a purple ball, which is achieved in step 19.

So this plan should work. Now, let's write it out properly with the actions.
