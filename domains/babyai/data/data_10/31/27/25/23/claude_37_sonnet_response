Let me understand this grid world problem:

1. We have 4 rooms in a grid: room_1 (north-west), room_2 (south-west), room_3 (north-east), and room_4 (south-east).
2. Rooms are connected by 4 doors: room_1-room_2, room_1-room_3, room_2-room_4, room_3-room_4.
3. The world has objects: boxes, balls, doors, all with colors.
4. We can move, pick up and drop objects, and toggle doors from locked to unlocked and vice versa.

Now, let's look at the problem:

Initial State:
- We are in room_1.
- Room_1 contains: green_box_1, grey_ball_1, and green_box_2.
- Room_3 contains: purple_ball_1, purple_box_1, red_ball_1, and grey_ball_2.
- Room_4 contains: yellow_box_1.
- All doors are locked.
- We're not holding any object.

Goal:
- We need to be in front of a green door, and that door should be unlocked.

Constraints:
- We need to pick up grey_ball_1 before unlocking green_door_1.
- green_door_1 should be unlocked at some point.

So, the general strategy would be:
1. Pick up grey_ball_1.
2. Go to green_door_1.
3. Use grey_ball_1 in some way to unlock green_door_1.
4. Drop grey_ball_1 (if needed).
5. Ensure we're in front of a green door and it's unlocked.

Let's see what actions we can take to fulfill this:

1. Since we're in room_1 and grey_ball_1 is in room_1, we can first go in front of grey_ball_1.
2. Then pick it up.
3. Then go in front of green_door_1, which connects room_1 and room_2.
4. Then toggle it to unlock it.
5. We're now in front of an unlocked green door, which satisfies the goal.

But wait, the constraints say we need to pick up grey_ball_1 before unlocking green_door_1. This is something we've followed in our plan. Let's ensure it satisfies all the conditions.

Checking the constraints:
- "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'green_door_1 is not locked'": Our plan has a step where we unlock green_door_1, so this is satisfied.
- "If expression 'green_door_1 is not locked' holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: 'you are holding grey_ball_1'": We pick up grey_ball_1 before unlocking green_door_1, so this is also satisfied.

The plan seems to meet all the constraints. Let's write out the detailed plan:

```
gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_1
pick grey_ball_1 room_1
gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_2
toggle green_door_1
```

This should be a valid plan to achieve the goal.

Actually, let me double-check the effects of the actions to ensure our plan is valid:

1. "gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_1": After this, we'll be in front of grey_ball_1 in room_1.
2. "pick grey_ball_1 room_1": After this, we're no longer in front of grey_ball_1, our hands are not empty, we're carrying grey_ball_1, and grey_ball_1 is no longer in room_1. So far, so good.
3. "gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_2": After this, we'll be in front of green_door_1 in room_1, connecting room_1 and room_2.
4. "toggle green_door_1": After this, green_door_1 will be unlocked.

So, at the end of the plan:
- We are in front of green_door_1.
- green_door_1 is a green door (as specified in the initial state).
- green_door_1 is unlocked.

This satisfies the goal: "There is a door d such that 'The following conditions are all true: "d is green", "you are in front of d", "d is not locked""

So, our plan is valid.

Let me think again...

Ok, as I think about it, and review the constraints, I misread one thing. The constraints don't mandate that we use the grey_ball_1 to unlock green_door_1. They just specify that if green_door_1 is unlocked, then we must have been holding grey_ball_1 at an earlier point.

This means we don't necessarily need to be holding grey_ball_1 when we unlock green_door_1; we just need to have held it sometime before.

But in our specific plan, we'll indeed be holding grey_ball_1 when we unlock green_door_1. So, the correct plan is:

```
gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_1
pick grey_ball_1 room_1
gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_2
toggle green_door_1
```

This satisfies both the goal and the constraints. Let me retrace the steps:

1. We start in room_1.
2. We go in front of grey_ball_1 (which is in room_1).
3. We pick up grey_ball_1.
4. We go in front of green_door_1, which connects room_1 and room_2.
5. We toggle green_door_1, making it unlocked.
6. At this point, we're in front of an unlocked green door, which satisfies the goal.

But wait, I'm wondering if I'm missing something. The task says we need to provide an "optimal" plan, meaning the shortest plan. Let's think about alternatives.

There are multiple green doors: green_door_1, green_door_2, and green_door_3. The goal just asks for an unlocked green door without specifying which one. So, potentially, we could use any of these three doors.

However, the constraints specifically mention green_door_1. So, if we're going to unlock a green door, if we're considering green_door_1, we need to have held grey_ball_1 at some point. But it doesn't say anything about the other green doors.

So, could we skip the grey_ball_1 step and just go to another green door, like green_door_2 or green_door_3? Let's check:

1. green_door_1 connects room_1 and room_2. We're already in room_1.
2. green_door_2 connects room_2 and room_4. To reach it, we'd need to go through room_2, which means going through a door to get to room_2. But all doors are initially locked.
3. green_door_3 connects room_3 and room_4. Similarly, we'd need to go through either room_3 or room_4, which would require passing through a locked door.

So, essentially, we can only reach green_door_1 directly. And unlocking it would require having held grey_ball_1 at some point, as per the constraints.

So, it seems like the shortest plan would indeed be the one we outlined:

```
gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_1
pick grey_ball_1 room_1
gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_2
toggle green_door_1
```

This should be the optimal plan to achieve the goal.

Let's double check the plan to make sure it's valid:

1. "gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_1":
   - Precondition: We are in room_1, grey_ball_1 is in room_1. This action satisfies its preconditions.
   - Effect: We are now in front of grey_ball_1 in room_1.

2. "pick grey_ball_1 room_1":
   - Precondition: We are in front of grey_ball_1 in room_1, and we are not holding any object. This action satisfies its preconditions.
   - Effect: We are now holding grey_ball_1, our hands are not empty, and grey_ball_1 is no longer in room_1.

3. "gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_2":
   - Precondition: We are in room_1, green_door_1 connects room_1 and room_2, and there is no object blocking the position in front of green_door_1 in room_1. This action satisfies its preconditions.
   - Effect: We are now in front of green_door_1 in room_1.

4. "toggle green_door_1":
   - Precondition: We are in front of green_door_1. This action satisfies its preconditions.
   - Effect: green_door_1 is now unlocked.

End state: We are in front of green_door_1, green_door_1 is a green door (as specified in the initial state), and green_door_1 is unlocked.

So, the goal is achieved. We are in front of a green door (green_door_1), and it's unlocked.

Also, the constraints are respected:
- "green_door_1 is not locked" holds in the end state.
- Before this, we were holding grey_ball_1 (after the "pick" action).

Again, I believe this is a valid and optimal plan.
