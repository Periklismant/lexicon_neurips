Let me understand the scenario and problem first:

The world is a 2D gridworld with 4 rooms arranged in a square: room_1 (NW), room_2 (SW), room_3 (NE), and room_4 (SE). Rooms are connected by doors, which can be locked or unlocked.

The goal is:
- Have a grey ball in room_4
- Be in room_4
- Be in front of that grey ball

The constraint is:
- At some point, purple_ball_1 must be in room_4 and I must be in front of red_box_1

The initial state:
- I am in room_2
- grey_ball_1 is in room_1
- red_ball_1 is in room_1
- blue_box_1 is in room_2
- red_box_1 is in room_3
- green_box_1 is in room_3
- grey_ball_2 is in room_3
- purple_ball_1 is in room_3
- grey_ball_3 is in room_4
- All doors are locked

Let me check the available actions and their preconditions and effects again.

Now, let me plan:

1. There are three grey balls (grey_ball_1, grey_ball_2, grey_ball_3). Since grey_ball_3 is already in room_4, it's the most direct way to satisfy the first part of the goal.

2. To get to room_4, I need to unlock and go through a door. From room_2, I can go to room_4 via purple_door_1.

3. The constraint requires that at some point, purple_ball_1 (currently in room_3) must be in room_4 and I must be in front of red_box_1 (currently in room_3).

So, I need to:
- Unlock and go through doors to reach room_3
- Pick up purple_ball_1
- Go in front of red_box_1 (satisfying the constraint)
- Take purple_ball_1 to room_4
- Drop purple_ball_1 in room_4
- Go in front of grey_ball_3 in room_4

Let's work out the detailed plan:

Starting in room_2:
1. Go to purple_door_1 to unlock it (this leads to room_4)
2. But wait, I need to satisfy the constraint first
3. I need to go to room_3 to get purple_ball_1 and be in front of red_box_1

To get to room_3 from room_2, I have two options:
a. room_2 -> room_1 (via red_door_1) -> room_3 (via green_door_1)
b. room_2 -> room_4 (via purple_door_1) -> room_3 (via grey_door_1)

Let's go with option a:

1. Go to red_door_1 in room_2
2. Toggle red_door_1 to unlock it
3. Go to room_1 via red_door_1
4. Go to green_door_1 in room_1
5. Toggle green_door_1 to unlock it
6. Go to room_3 via green_door_1
7. Go to purple_ball_1 in room_3
8. Pick up purple_ball_1
9. Go to red_box_1 in room_3 (satisfying the constraint)
10. Go to grey_door_1 in room_3
11. Toggle grey_door_1 to unlock it
12. Go to room_4 via grey_door_1
13. Drop purple_ball_1 in room_4
14. Go to grey_ball_3 in room_4

Let me validate this plan:

Steps 1-6 get me from room_2 to room_3.
Steps 7-8 have me pick up purple_ball_1.
Step 9 satisfies the constraint (I'm in front of red_box_1 while holding purple_ball_1, which will eventually end up in room_4).
Steps 10-12 get me to room_4.
Step 13 drops purple_ball_1 in room_4, completing the constraint.
Step 14 puts me in front of grey_ball_3 in room_4, satisfying the goal.

Wait, there's an issue with step 9. If I'm holding purple_ball_1, I can't really be directly "in front of" red_box_1 since I need to be in front of an object to pick it up. Let me adjust:

1. Go to red_door_1 in room_2
2. Toggle red_door_1 to unlock it
3. Go to room_1 via red_door_1
4. Go to green_door_1 in room_1
5. Toggle green_door_1 to unlock it
6. Go to room_3 via green_door_1
7. Go to red_box_1 in room_3
8. Go to purple_ball_1 in room_3
9. Pick up purple_ball_1
10. Go to red_box_1 in room_3 (satisfying the constraint - I'm in front of red_box_1 while holding purple_ball_1)
11. Go to grey_door_1 in room_3
12. Toggle grey_door_1 to unlock it
13. Go to room_4 via grey_door_1
14. Drop purple_ball_1 in room_4
15. Go to grey_ball_3 in room_4

Wait, no - I need to plan this more carefully. The constraint states: "The following conditions are all true: 'purple_ball_1 is in room_4', 'you are in front of red_box_1'".

So I need to:
1. Get purple_ball_1 to room_4
2. Then be in front of red_box_1

Since red_box_1 is in room_3 and purple_ball_1 needs to be in room_4, I need to:
1. Pick up purple_ball_1 from room_3
2. Take it to room_4
3. Drop it
4. Then go back to room_3 to be in front of red_box_1

Let's revise:

1. Go to red_door_1 in room_2
2. Toggle red_door_1 to unlock it
3. Go to room_1 via red_door_1
4. Go to green_door_1 in room_1
5. Toggle green_door_1 to unlock it
6. Go to room_3 via green_door_1
7. Go to purple_ball_1 in room_3
8. Pick up purple_ball_1
9. Go to grey_door_1 in room_3
10. Toggle grey_door_1 to unlock it
11. Go to room_4 via grey_door_1
12. Drop purple_ball_1 in room_4
13. Go to room_3 via grey_door_1 (already unlocked)
14. Go to red_box_1 in room_3 (satisfying the constraint)
15. Go to room_4 via grey_door_1 (already unlocked)
16. Go to grey_ball_3 in room_4

Actually, I don't have to go to room_1. Let me try to find a more direct path:

Starting in room_2:
1. Go to purple_door_1 in room_2
2. Toggle purple_door_1 to unlock it
3. Go to room_4 via purple_door_1
4. Go to grey_door_1 in room_4
5. Toggle grey_door_1 to unlock it
6. Go to room_3 via grey_door_1
7. Go to purple_ball_1 in room_3
8. Pick up purple_ball_1
9. Go to room_4 via grey_door_1 (already unlocked)
10. Drop purple_ball_1 in room_4
11. Go to room_3 via grey_door_1 (already unlocked)
12. Go to red_box_1 in room_3 (satisfying the constraint)
13. Go to room_4 via grey_door_1 (already unlocked)
14. Go to grey_ball_3 in room_4

This seems more efficient. Let's translate to the specific action format:

```
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_4
toggle purple_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_4 purple_door_1
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3
toggle grey_door_1
gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1
gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_3
pick purple_ball_1 room_3
gotoroom room_3 room_4 grey_door_1
gotoempty
drop purple_ball_1 room_4
gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1
gotoobject red_box_1 room_3
gotoroom room_3 room_4 grey_door_1
gotoobject grey_ball_3 room_4
```

Hmm, let me check that I'm meeting the constraint correctly.

The constraint requires that at some point:
- purple_ball_1 is in room_4
- I am in front of red_box_1

In the plan above, after I drop purple_ball_1 in room_4 and go back to room_3 to face red_box_1, the purple_ball_1 is indeed in room_4 and I am in front of red_box_1. So the constraint is satisfied.

Now, let's double-check if I'm meeting the goal correctly:
- There is a grey ball in room_4 (grey_ball_3 is already there)
- I am in room_4 (I go there in the second-to-last step)
- I am in front of that grey ball (the last step)

So the goal is satisfied too.

Let me trace through the entire plan to make sure all preconditions are met for each action:

1. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_4: I'm in room_2, so I can go to the door.
2. toggle purple_door_1: I'm in front of the door, so I can toggle it.
3. gotoroom room_2 room_4 purple_door_1: Door is unlocked, so I can go through.
4. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3: I'm in room_4, so I can go to the door.
5. toggle grey_door_1: I'm in front of the door, so I can toggle it.
6. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1: Door is unlocked, so I can go through.
7. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_3: I'm in room_3, so I can go to the ball.
8. pick purple_ball_1 room_3: I'm in front of the ball and my hands are empty, so I can pick it up.
9. gotoroom room_3 room_4 grey_door_1: Door is unlocked, so I can go through.
10. gotoempty: I can go to an empty position.
11. drop purple_ball_1 room_4: I'm holding the ball and in front of an empty position, so I can drop it.
12. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1: Door is unlocked, so I can go through.
13. gotoobject red_box_1 room_3: I'm in room_3, so I can go to the box.
14. gotoroom room_3 room_4 grey_door_1: Door is unlocked, so I can go through.
15. gotoobject grey_ball_3 room_4: I'm in room_4, so I can go to the ball.

This plan seems correct. Let me just make sure the format of the actions is correct, with each action on a new line.

```
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_4
toggle purple_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_4 purple_door_1
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3
toggle grey_door_1
gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1
gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_3
pick purple_ball_1 room_3
gotoroom room_3 room_4 grey_door_1
gotoempty
drop purple_ball_1 room_4
gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1
gotoobject red_box_1 room_3
gotoroom room_3 room_4 grey_door_1
gotoobject grey_ball_3 room_4
```

Wait, I spotted a mistake. After I drop the purple ball, I actually need to be in front of an empty position. Let me correct the plan:

```
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_4
toggle purple_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_4 purple_door_1
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3
toggle grey_door_1
gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1
gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_3
pick purple_ball_1 room_3
gotoroom room_3 room_4 grey_door_1
gotoempty
drop purple_ball_1 room_4
gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1
gotoobject red_box_1 room_3
gotoroom room_3 room_4 grey_door_1
gotoobject grey_ball_3 room_4
```

Upon further reflection, I think the plan is correct as is. After I pick up the purple ball and go to room_4, I go to an empty position using `gotoempty` and then drop the ball in that position. This means I'll be in front of the purple ball after dropping it, which is fine.

So, the final plan is:

```
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_4
toggle purple_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_4 purple_door_1
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3
toggle grey_door_1
gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1
gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_3
pick purple_ball_1 room_3
gotoroom room_3 room_4 grey_door_1
gotoempty
drop purple_ball_1 room_4
gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1
gotoobject red_box_1 room_3
gotoroom room_3 room_4 grey_door_1
gotoobject grey_ball_3 room_4
```

This plan should satisfy both the constraint and the goal.
