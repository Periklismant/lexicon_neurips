Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. So, the goal is to have a purple box in room_1, be in room_1, and be in front of that box. The initial state is that I'm in room_2, and all doors are locked. Let me see what steps I need to take.

First, I need to get to room_1. The doors connecting room_2 to room_1 is red_door_1. But it's locked. To unlock it, I need to toggle it, but to toggle a door, I have to be in front of it. So I need to go to the red_door_1 in room_2. But wait, the red_door_1 connects room_1 and room_2. So I'm in room_2, so I can go to the red_door_1. But wait, the precondition for "gotodoor" says that there's no object blocking the position in front of the door in my current room. Are there any objects blocking doors in room_2? Let me check the initial state. The objects in room_2 are not mentioned except maybe me. The initial state lists objects in room_1, 3, and 4. So room_2's objects aren't listed, so maybe there are none. So I can go to the red_door_1 from room_2.

So steps would be: gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_1. Then toggle it to unlock. Then use gotoroom to go from room_2 to room_1 via red_door_1.

Once in room_1, I need to check if the purple_box_1 is already there. Wait, the initial state says purple_box_1 is in room_1. Oh, wait, the goal requires that there's a purple box in room_1, which is already true. But the other conditions are that I'm in room_1 and in front of that box. So the purple_box_1 is already in room_1. So maybe I just need to get to room_1 and then go in front of the purple_box_1.

Wait, but the doors are all locked initially. So the red_door_1 is locked. So I need to unlock it. Let's outline:

1. From room_2, go to red_door_1 (since it connects room_2 and room_1). So gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_1.

2. Toggle red_door_1 to unlock it.

3. Then go from room_2 to room_1 via red_door_1 using gotoroom room_2 room_1 red_door_1.

4. Now in room_1, need to go in front of purple_box_1. So gotoobject purple_box_1 room_1.

But wait, the "gotoobject" action requires that I'm in the same room as the object, which I would be after step 3. So that's possible.

But wait, are there any objects blocking the path to the purple_box_1? The initial state says purple_box_1 is in room_1, along with blue_ball_1 and red_ball_1. But I don't know their positions. The problem states that the agent can go to an object if they are in the same room. The "gotoobject" action's precondition is that you are in the same room as x. Since I'm in room_1, I can go to the purple_box_1. So the plan would be:

gotoobject purple_box_1 room_1.

So putting it all together:

1. gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_1

2. toggle red_door_1

3. gotoroom room_2 room_1 red_door_1

4. gotoobject purple_box_1 room_1

But wait, after step 3, when I go to room_1, the effect is that I'm no longer in front of anything. So after entering room_1, I'm in room_1 but not in front of any object. So then I need to use gotoobject to get in front of the purple box.

That seems correct. Let me check the preconditions again.

For step 1: gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_1. Preconditions: I'm in a room connected by door d (red_door_1 connects room_2 and room_1, so yes). Also, no object is blocking the position in front of d in the current room (room_2). Since initial state doesn't mention any objects in room_2 blocking doors, this should be okay.

Then toggle red_door_1: need to be in front of it, which step 1 puts me there.

After unlocking, gotoroom room_2 room_1 red_door_1: door is now unlocked, so this is allowed.

Then in room_1, gotoobject purple_box_1 room_1: which is allowed because I'm in the same room.

This plan should work. Let me check if there are any constraints I missed. The problem mentions that the valid plan must satisfy all constraints. Wait, the user mentioned constraints, but the problem's original description didn't list any specific constraints beyond the actions' preconditions. Wait, looking back:

"A valid plan for the abovementioned problem must abide by the following constraints:"

But then there's nothing written. Maybe a formatting error. Oh, maybe the user forgot to include the constraints. But in the problem as given, the constraints section is empty. So perhaps there are no additional constraints beyond the usual action preconditions. So the plan I outlined should be valid.

But let's double-check the initial state. The purple_box_1 is in room_1. So the goal requires that a purple box is there, which is already true. So we don't need to move it. The agent just needs to be in room_1 and in front of it.

So the plan is correct. The steps are: unlock the door, go through, then go to the box. The optimal plan should have four steps. Are there any shorter plans?

Wait, could I combine any steps? Let's see. After toggling the door, can I go through immediately? Yes. So steps 1-4 are necessary. There's no way to skip any of these steps. Because initially, the doors are locked, so you have to toggle them. Then move through. Then navigate to the box.

Yes, this is the minimal plan.
