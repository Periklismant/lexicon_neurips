Okay, let's try to figure out how to solve this planning problem. The goal is to have a blue box that I'm in front of. So, I need to be in front of a blue box. The initial state has me in room_1 with blue_box_1 and blue_box_2. So maybe I can just go to one of them? But wait, the doors are all locked. Let me check the initial state again.

The doors yellow_door_1, yellow_door_2, red_door_1, and green_door_1 are all locked. Since I'm in room_1, the doors connecting to room_2 (yellow_door_1) and room_3 (yellow_door_2) are locked. So I can't leave room_1 unless I can unlock them. But to unlock a door, I need to toggle it, which requires being in front of it. But to get in front of the door, I need to go to it. However, if there's an object blocking the door's position, I can't go there. Let's check if any objects are blocking doors in room_1.

In room_1, there are blue_box_1 and blue_box_2. Are these boxes blocking the doors? The problem mentions that objects can block doors. So if a box is in front of a door in room_1, then when I try to goto door, I can't if there's an object there. But how do I know where the boxes are placed relative to the doors? The initial state doesn't specify positions, just that the boxes are in the room. Maybe the assumption is that unless stated otherwise, objects are not blocking doors. Wait, the preconditions for "goto door" require that there's no object blocking the position in front of the door in the current room. So I need to check if any objects are blocking the doors in room_1. If the boxes are not in front of the doors, then I can go to the door. But since the initial state doesn't mention blocking, maybe they aren't. So perhaps I can proceed.

So here's the plan: I'm in room_1. I need to unlock either yellow_door_1 or yellow_door_2 to leave. But wait, the goal is to be in front of a blue box. Since I'm already in room_1 with blue boxes, maybe I can just go to one of them. But wait, the "gotoobject x r" action requires that I'm in the same room as x. I am in room_1. So can I just do "gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1"? That would put me in front of it. Then the goal is achieved. But why isn't that possible? Let me check the preconditions for "gotoobject". The precondition is that I'm in the same room as x. Yes. So if I can perform "gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1", then that's the shortest plan. But wait, what's preventing me from doing that? Are there any constraints?

Wait, the constraints weren't specified here. The user mentioned the problem includes a set of constraints, but in the provided problem description, under "A valid plan for the abovementioned problem must abide by the following constraints:", there's nothing written. Maybe that's a formatting error, but assuming there are no additional constraints beyond the action preconditions, then the answer is simple: just go to the blue box in room_1.

But let me recheck the initial state. The initial state says "you are in room_1", and "blue_box_1 is in room_1", "blue_box_2 is in room_1". So both are in room_1. So the agent is in room_1. To achieve the goal, they need to be in front of a blue box. So the action would be "gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1" or "gotoobject blue_box_2 room_1".

But wait, the problem says "you are in room_1" but doesn't mention where in the room. The "gotoobject" action moves you in front of the object. So unless there's a precondition that the object is not blocked by something else, but the preconditions only state that you are in the same room. So as long as the agent is in the same room as the object, they can go to it. So the plan would be a single action: gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1.

But that seems too simple. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me check again.

Wait, the doors are all locked, but the agent doesn't need to leave the room. The goal can be achieved in room_1. So why isn't the solution just that one action?

Unless there's a constraint that the agent can't be in front of an object unless certain conditions are met. Let me check the preconditions again. The "gotoobject" action's preconditions are: you must be in the same room as x. That's all. So if the agent is in room_1 and the object is in room_1, then yes.

So the optimal plan is just one step: gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1. But why is the initial problem setup so complicated then? Maybe the user made a mistake in the problem description, or perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, the original problem states that the doors are locked. But the agent is in room_1, and the blue boxes are in room_1. So even if the doors are locked, the agent doesn't need to go through them. So the answer is simply to go to the blue box in the same room.

Therefore, the optimal plan is:

```
gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1
```

But I need to make sure there's no constraint preventing this. The user might have forgotten to include constraints, but according to the given problem, there are no additional constraints. So the answer is straightforward.
