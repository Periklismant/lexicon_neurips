Okay, let's see. The goal is to have a yellow door that I'm in front of and it's unlocked. The initial state has all doors locked. So I need to find a yellow door, go in front of it, and toggle it to unlock. But first, I have to navigate through the rooms since I'm starting in room_4.

The doors are: purple_door_1 (purple) connects room_1 and room_2. yellow_door_1 (yellow) connects room_1 and room_3. green_door_1 (green) connects room_2 and room_4. yellow_door_2 (yellow) connects room_3 and room_4. So the yellow doors are yellow_door_1 (between 1 and 3) and yellow_door_2 (between 3 and 4). 

But I'm in room_4. The closest yellow door would be yellow_door_2, connecting room_4 and room_3. But that door is locked. To get in front of it, I need to be in room_4 and go to that door. But the door is locked. Wait, the precondition for "gotodoor d r1 r2" is that I'm in a room connected by d, and there's no object blocking the position in front of d. Are there any objects blocking doors in room_4? Let's check the initial state.

In room_4, the objects are blue_ball_1, red_ball_1, blue_ball_2. The doors connected to room_4 are green_door_1 (with room_2) and yellow_door_2 (with room_3). So in room_4, the doors are green_door_1 and yellow_door_2. Are there any objects blocking these doors? The initial positions of objects: blue_ball_1, red_ball_1, blue_ball_2 are in room_4. But unless they are in front of the doors, which I don't know. The problem doesn't specify where exactly the objects are placed in the room. But the preconditions for "gotodoor" require that there's no object blocking the position in front of d. If the objects are in the way, then I can't go to the door. But the problem statement doesn't mention any such blocking. So maybe the default is that objects aren't blocking doors unless stated. So perhaps I can go to the door.

But wait, the doors are all locked. So even if I go in front of a door, I need to toggle it. But "toggle d" can only be done if I'm in front of d. So the plan would be: go to the door in room_4 (yellow_door_2), which is connected to room_3. Then toggle it. But first, I need to get in front of it.

Wait, but the problem is that the doors are locked. So to toggle, I can unlock them. So here's the initial thought: In room_4, go to the door yellow_door_2 (since it's yellow). Then toggle it, which will unlock it. Then, since the goal requires that the door is not locked, that would satisfy the conditions. But the goal says "there is a door d such that d is yellow, you are in front of d, and d is not locked." So after toggling yellow_door_2, it's unlocked. But after toggling, the action's effect is to unlock if it was locked. So initial state: yellow_door_2 is locked. So after toggle, it becomes unlocked. Then, I need to be in front of it. But when you perform the toggle action, you have to be in front of the door. So the steps would be:

1. Gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_3. But am I allowed? The preconditions are that I'm in a room connected by d (room_4 is connected via yellow_door_2 to room_3), and no object is blocking the position in front of d in the current room. Assuming no blocking, then I can go to the door. Then, once in front of it, toggle it. Then the door is unlocked. Then, since I'm still in front of it, the goal is achieved.

Wait, but the action "toggle d" requires being in front of d. So the sequence would be:

- gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_3 (so I'm in front of it)
- toggle yellow_door_2 (unlocking it)
But after that, the door is unlocked, and I'm still in front of it. So the goal is satisfied: there exists a door (yellow_door_2) which is yellow, I'm in front of it, and it's not locked. That seems like the shortest plan. But is there a reason why this wouldn't work?

Wait, in the initial state, the agent is in room_4. The yellow_door_2 connects room_4 and room_3. So the action "gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_3" is possible because the agent is in room_4, which is connected via that door. Then, after going to the door, the toggle action can be performed. Then the door is unlocked. So the plan would be:

```
gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_3
toggle yellow_door_2
```

But wait, after the toggle, the door is unlocked. Then the agent is still in front of the door. So all conditions are met: a yellow door (yellow_door_2 is yellow), agent is in front of it, and it's unlocked. So this seems to satisfy the goal. But the problem says the initial doors are all locked, so toggling once unlocks them. So this should be a valid plan with two steps. But I need to check if there's any constraints that prevent this.

The constraints are part of the problem. Wait, the user mentioned "A valid plan for the abovementioned problem must abide by the following constraints:" but then in the original message, after the initial state, the constraints section is empty. Wait, looking back:

The user wrote:

"The task is to bring about the following situation:
	"There is a door d such that "The following conditions are all true: "d is yellow", "you are in front of d", "d is not locked"""

A valid plan for the abovementioned problem must abide by the following constraints:

"

Wait, after that, there's nothing. So maybe the constraints are empty? Or maybe there was a formatting error. Let me check again. The original problem says:

"Provided a planning problem, consisting of an initial state of the world, a final goal and a set of constraints, your task is to provide a valid sequence of actions that solves the planning problem, i.e., bringing about the goal of the problem while satisfying all constraints."

But in the problem description given, after stating the goal, it says "A valid plan for the abovementioned problem must abide by the following constraints:" but then there's no constraints listed. So perhaps there are no additional constraints beyond the preconditions of the actions. So in that case, the plan I thought of would work.

But let's check the preconditions again. For "gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_3": the agent is in room_4, which is connected via yellow_door_2 to room_3. So condition (i) is met. (ii) there is no object blocking the position in front of d in the current room (room_4). The initial state says that room_4 has blue_ball_1, red_ball_1, and blue_ball_2. Are any of these blocking the door? The problem doesn't specify the positions of objects in the room, only their presence. So perhaps the default assumption is that objects are not blocking doors unless stated. Therefore, the gotodoor action is allowed. Then, toggle is allowed because the agent is in front of the door.

Therefore, the optimal plan is just two actions. But wait, the initial state says that the agent is in room_4. Let me confirm that. Yes, the original state says "you are in room_4".

So the steps would be:

1. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_3 (so now agent is in front of yellow_door_2)
2. toggle yellow_door_2 (unlocks it, now the door is unlocked)

After these actions, the agent is in front of a yellow door (yellow_door_2) that is not locked, satisfying the goal. Therefore, this is the shortest possible plan.
