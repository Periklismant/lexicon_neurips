Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. The goal is to have a yellow door that's unlocked, and I need to be in front of it. The constraints are a bit complex, so I need to make sure each one is satisfied at some point in the plan. Let me start by understanding all the requirements.

First, the final goal: there exists a door d that is yellow, I'm in front of it, and it's not locked. The doors in the problem are yellow_door_1 (connecting room_1 and room_3), yellow_door_2 (connecting room_3 and room_4). Since I start in room_4, maybe yellow_door_2 is the easier target because it's connected to room_4. But I need to check which doors are yellow. Both yellow_door_1 and yellow_door_2 are yellow. However, the initial position is room_4. So maybe yellow_door_2 is more accessible.

But first, all the doors are locked initially. So I need to unlock at least one yellow door. The toggle action can unlock a door if I'm in front of it. But to get in front of a door, I need to be in a room connected by that door and have no object blocking it. Wait, the preconditions for "gotodoor d r1 r2" require that I'm in a room connected by d and that there's no object blocking the position in front of d in the current room. So I need to check if any doors are blocked by objects.

Looking at the initial state, the objects in each room:

- room_1 has yellow_ball_1.
- room_2 has red_box_1.
- room_3 has purple_box_1, blue_box_1, grey_box_1.
- room_4 has blue_ball_1, red_ball_1, blue_ball_2.

Doors:

- purple_door_1 connects room_1 and room_2.
- yellow_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3.
- green_door_1 connects room_2 and room_4.
- yellow_door_2 connects room_3 and room_4.

Since I'm in room_4 initially, the doors here are green_door_1 (to room_2) and yellow_door_2 (to room_3). To reach yellow_door_2, I need to be in room_4 or room_3. But yellow_door_2 is between room_3 and room_4. Wait, the "gotodoor" action requires that I'm in a room connected by the door. So if I'm in room_4, I can go to yellow_door_2 (since it connects room_4 and room_3), but I need to check if there's an object blocking the position in front of the door in room_4. The objects in room_4 are balls, but are any of them blocking the door? The problem statement doesn't mention objects blocking doors unless they are in front. Since the initial state doesn't specify any objects blocking doors, I assume that the doors are not blocked. So maybe I can go to yellow_door_2 from room_4, but the door is locked. So to unlock it, I need to be in front of it and toggle it. But since it's locked, toggling would unlock it. But wait, the toggle action toggles the state. So if it's locked, toggle unlocks it. So after toggling, it becomes unlocked.

But the problem is that all doors are locked initially. So to get to yellow_door_2, I need to first unlock the door leading to it. Wait, but I'm already in room_4, which is connected via yellow_door_2 to room_3. So to go to the door yellow_door_2 from room_4, I can use "gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_3". But the preconditions for gotodoor are that I'm in a room connected by the door (which I am, room_4) and that there's no object blocking the position. Since room_4 has balls, but unless they are in front of the door, they aren't blocking. Since the initial positions aren't specified, maybe they aren't blocking. So I can go to the door. Then toggle it to unlock. But wait, the door is locked, so I can't go through it yet. But I just need to be in front of it to toggle.

But let's outline the steps. To unlock yellow_door_2:

1. From room_4, go to yellow_door_2 (gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_3). But is that allowed? The door connects room_4 and room_3. So yes, I can do that from room_4. Then toggle it. That would unlock it. But according to the constraints, there's a constraint that if yellow_door_2 is unlocked in some state, there must be an earlier state where I'm holding red_box_1. So I need to have held red_box_1 before unlocking yellow_door_2.

Red_box_1 is in room_2. So how do I get to room_2? The doors from room_4 to room_2 is green_door_1, which is also locked. So to get to room_2, I need to unlock green_door_1. But green_door_1 is in room_4 and room_2. So from room_4, I can go to green_door_1, toggle it to unlock. But again, the same problem: toggling green_door_1 requires being in front of it. But first, I need to go to green_door_1 from room_4. Then toggle it. Then go through it to room_2. But how do I reach green_door_1? Let's see.

But before all that, the constraints require that:

- "The following expression must hold in at least one state: "green_door_1 is not locked"". So green_door_1 must be unlocked at some point.

Also, "The following expression must hold in at least one state: "you are holding red_box_1"". So I need to pick up red_box_1, which is in room_2. So to get to room_2, I need to go through green_door_1. But green_door_1 is locked. So I need to unlock it. So the plan would involve:

1. From room_4, go to green_door_1 (gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2). Then toggle it to unlock. Then go to room_2 via green_door_1. Then pick up red_box_1. But how to get to green_door_1? Let's see.

But green_door_1 connects room_2 and room_4. So from room_4, I can go to green_door_1. The preconditions for gotodoor are met if I'm in room_4 (since green_door_1 connects room_4 and room_2) and no object is blocking the door in room_4. Since room_4 has balls, but unless they are in front of the door, which is not stated, it's allowed. So:

Action: gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2

Then toggle green_door_1 (since it's locked, toggling unlocks it). Now green_door_1 is unlocked.

Then, gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_1. Now I'm in room_2. Then, gotoobject red_box_1 room_2. Pick it up. Now I'm holding red_box_1. This satisfies the constraint that I must have held red_box_1 before unlocking yellow_door_2 (if that's needed later). Also, another constraint requires that "you are holding red_box_1" at some state, which this satisfies.

Then, after picking red_box_1, I need to drop it somewhere, but maybe not yet. Wait, the constraints also require that "At least one of the following conditions is true: "you are holding red_box_1", "red_box_1 is in room_4"". So either I'm holding it or it's in room_4. If I take it to room_4, that's possible. But perhaps after using it for the yellow_door_2 unlocking.

But let's think. The constraint for yellow_door_2 being unlocked requires that I was holding red_box_1 before. So if I unlock yellow_door_2 after picking up red_box_1, that's okay. So after picking up red_box_1 in room_2, I can go back to room_4 via green_door_1 (since it's now unlocked). Then go to yellow_door_2 in room_4, toggle it (unlocking it). At that point, yellow_door_2 is unlocked, and I was holding red_box_1 earlier, which satisfies the constraint.

But let's outline the steps so far:

1. goto green_door_1 from room_4 (gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2)
2. toggle green_door_1 (unlocks it)
3. gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_1 (move to room_2)
4. gotoobject red_box_1 room_2
5. pick red_box_1 room_2 (now holding it)
6. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4 (go to green door from room_2)
7. toggle green_door_1 (lock it again? Wait, but the constraint is that green_door_1 must be unlocked at least once. So unlocking it once is enough. But after step 2, it's unlocked. Then moving to room_2. Then step 6 is to go back to the door from room_2. Toggling again would lock it. But maybe not necessary. Instead, after picking up red_box_1, I need to return to room_4 to access yellow_door_2. So step 6: gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4 (since in room_2, the door connects to room_4). Then step 7: gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1 (since the door is unlocked). Now back in room_4. Then go to yellow_door_2.

But first, after returning to room_4, I need to go to yellow_door_2:

8. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_3
9. toggle yellow_door_2 (unlocking it)
10. Now, the final goal requires being in front of a yellow, unlocked door. So after step 9, I'm in front of yellow_door_2, which is now unlocked. So that satisfies the goal.

But wait, after step 9, the door is unlocked, and I'm in front of it. So the goal is achieved. But let's check the constraints:

- "yellow_door_2 is not locked" must hold in some state. Step 9 makes it true.
- The constraint that if yellow_door_2 is unlocked, I must have held red_box_1 before. Steps 5 (holding) happens before step 9.
- "green_door_1 is not locked" must hold in some state. Step 2 unlocks it, so that's covered.
- "you are holding red_box_1" is step 5.
- The "At least one of red_box_1 held or in room_4": after step 5, held; later, if we drop it in room_4, that also satisfies. But in the current plan, after step 5, we carry it back to room_4. So if we drop it there, that's another state where it's in room_4. But the constraint is that at least once either held or in room_4. Since we have step 5 (held), that's covered.
- "At least one of grey_box_1 in room_4 or holding some object": grey_box_1 is in room_3. So unless we move it, it's not in room_4. So during the time when we're holding red_box_1 (steps 5-7, 8,9), we are holding an object. So that satisfies the constraint.
- "you are in front of yellow_door_2" is step 8 and 9. So that's covered.
- If in front of yellow_door_2, must have held some object earlier. When we are in front of yellow_door_2 (step 8), the previous steps include holding red_box_1 (step 5-9). So that's satisfied.
- "At least one of holding some object or in room_1": We need to be in room_1 at some point. Wait, another constraint is "you are in room_1" must hold in some state. So the current plan doesn't include going to room_1. That's a problem. So we need to ensure that the agent visits room_1 at some point.

Ah, right! The constraints include:

- "The following expression must hold in at least one state: "you are in room_1""

So the current plan doesn't include going to room_1. That's a problem. So I need to adjust the plan to include visiting room_1.

How can I get to room_1? Let's see. The doors connecting to room_1 are purple_door_1 (room_1-room_2) and yellow_door_1 (room_1-room_3). Both are locked initially.

So to get to room_1, I need to unlock either purple_door_1 or yellow_door_1. Let's see:

Purple_door_1 connects room_1 and room_2. So if I can get to room_2, which I can via green_door_1 (after unlocking), then from room_2, I can go to purple_door_1. But purple_door_1 is locked. So I need to unlock it.

But purple_door_1 is purple. There's a purple_box_1 in room_3. Maybe that's relevant? Wait, but how does that help? Unless I need to use the purple box to unlock the purple door. But the problem doesn't mention any such mechanics. The toggle action just requires being in front of the door. So to unlock purple_door_1, I need to be in front of it and toggle it. But to get in front of it, I need to be in room_1 or room_2. Since room_2 is accessible after unlocking green_door_1, from room_2, I can go to purple_door_1 (gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1). Then toggle it to unlock. Then go to room_1.

But adding this to the plan would require:

After step 3 (in room_2), before step 4 (picking up red_box_1):

3a. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1
3b. toggle purple_door_1 (unlock)
3c. gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1 (enter room_1)
3d. Now in room_1. Then need to go back to room_2 to pick up red_box_1.

But this adds several steps. Also, after going to room_1, the agent would have visited room_1, satisfying that constraint. Then return to room_2, pick up red_box_1, and proceed as before.

But this complicates the plan. Let's see if there's another way. Alternatively, after unlocking yellow_door_2 and achieving the goal, perhaps the agent can go to room_3 via yellow_door_2, then to room_1 via yellow_door_1, but yellow_door_1 is locked. So need to unlock that.

But that's even more steps. Let's evaluate the current constraints. The constraint is that "you are in room_1" must hold in some state. So even a temporary visit is enough. So inserting a trip to room_1 into the plan.

Let's adjust the plan to include visiting room_1:

After step 3 (in room_2), go to purple_door_1:

3a. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1
3b. toggle purple_door_1 (unlock)
3c. gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1 (enter room_1)
3d. Now in room_1. So the constraint is met here.

Then return to room_2 via purple_door_1:

3e. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2
3f. toggle purple_door_1 (lock it again? No, because the constraint only requires that green_door_1 is unlocked once, and others are not mentioned. But perhaps toggling is needed to go back. Wait, after unlocking purple_door_1 in step 3b, it's unlocked. So to go back from room_1 to room_2, the door is already unlocked.

So steps 3e: gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1. Because the door is already unlocked.

So steps would be:

1. goto green_door_1 in room_4
2. toggle green_door_1 (unlock)
3. goto room_2 via green_door_1
4. goto purple_door_1 in room_2
5. toggle purple_door_1 (unlock)
6. goto room_1 via purple_door_1
7. Now in room_1. This satisfies the "you are in room_1" constraint.
8. Then return to room_2 via purple_door_1 (since it's unlocked)
9. Now in room_2, proceed to pick up red_box_1.

Continuing the plan:

10. gotoobject red_box_1 room_2
11. pick red_box_1 room_2
12. Then go back to room_4 via green_door_1 (unlocked)
13. goto yellow_door_2 in room_4
14. toggle yellow_door_2 (unlock)
15. Now in front of yellow_door_2, which is unlocked. Goal achieved.

But this adds several steps, but it's necessary to visit room_1. Also, need to check other constraints.

Another constraint: "At least one of the following conditions is true: "you are holding some object", "you are in room_1"". So when in room_1 (step 7), that condition is met. Also, when holding red_box_1 (steps 11 onwards), that condition is met.

Another constraint: "you are in front of green_door_1" must hold in some state. Step 1 (gotodoor green_door_1) satisfies that.

Also, "you are holding some object" must hold in some state (step 11).

So this plan seems to cover all constraints. Now let's check the order and steps.

Let me outline the steps again:

1. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2 (in room_4, go to green door)
2. toggle green_door_1 (unlock)
3. gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_1 (enter room_2)
4. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1 (go to purple door in room_2)
5. toggle purple_door_1 (unlock)
6. gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1 (enter room_1)
7. (now in room_1, constraint met)
8. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2 (go back to purple door in room_1)
9. toggle purple_door_1 (lock it again? Not necessary. Just need to go back)
Wait, no. The door is already unlocked. So to go back to room_2, just use gotoroom.

Wait, after step 6, the agent is in room_1. To return to room_2, use gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1. Since the door is unlocked. So step 8 would be:

8. gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1 (back to room_2)
9. Now in room_2 again. Then go to red_box_1.

10. gotoobject red_box_1 room_2
11. pick red_box_1 room_2
12. Then go to green_door_1 in room_2.

13. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4
14. toggle green_door_1 (lock it again? Not necessary. The door is already unlocked from step 2. But perhaps not needed. We just need to go through it.)

15. gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1 (back to room_4)
16. Now in room_4. Then go to yellow_door_2.

17. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_3
18. toggle yellow_door_2 (unlock)
19. Now in front of yellow_door_2, which is unlocked. Goal achieved.

This plan includes all necessary steps. Let's check all constraints:

- "yellow_door_2 is not locked" in step 18: yes.
- Before step 18, step 11: holding red_box_1. So the constraint that unlocking yellow_door_2 requires earlier holding red_box_1 is met.
- "green_door_1 is not locked" in step 2: yes.
- "you are holding red_box_1" in step 11: yes.
- "At least one of holding red_box_1 or it's in room_4": after step 11, holding. If we drop it in room_4 later, but in the current plan, we don't drop it. So step 11 covers it.
- "At least one of grey_box_1 in room_4 or holding some object": during steps 11-19, holding red_box_1, so that's covered.
- "you are in front of yellow_door_2" in step 17 and 18: yes.
- Before being in front of yellow_door_2 (step 17), step 11: holding red_box_1. So that's covered.
- "At least one of holding some object or in room_1": step 7 (in room_1) and steps 11-19 (holding). So covered.
- "you are in room_1" in step 6: yes.
- "you are in front of green_door_1" in step 1 and 13: yes.
- "you are holding some object" in steps 11-19: yes.

All constraints are satisfied. Now, is this plan optimal? Let's see if there's a shorter way.

Alternative approach: Can we avoid visiting room_1 by using another door? For example, going from room_3 to room_1 via yellow_door_1. But room_3 is connected to room_1 via yellow_door_1, which is locked. To unlock yellow_door_1, need to be in room_1 or room_3. But room_3 has purple_box_1, etc. But the agent starts in room_4. To get to room_3, need to go through yellow_door_2 (room_4 to room_3). But yellow_door_2 is locked. To unlock it, need to be in front of it, which requires going to room_4's side. Which is possible. Wait, but unlocking yellow_door_2 requires having held red_box_1 before. So if I first unlock yellow_door_2, but that requires having held red_box_1. Which is in room_2. To get to room_2, need to unlock green_door_1. So it's a similar dependency.

Alternatively, perhaps the agent can unlock green_door_1, go to room_2, get red_box_1, then go to room_1 via purple_door_1 (unlocking it), then proceed. That's similar to the previous plan. So the steps are necessary. I think the current plan is the minimal steps required to meet all constraints. Let's count the steps:

The steps are:

1. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2
2. toggle green_door_1
3. gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_1
4. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1
5. toggle purple_door_1
6. gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1
7. gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1
8. gotoobject red_box_1 room_2
9. pick red_box_1 room_2
10. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4
11. gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1
12. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_3
13. toggle yellow_door_2

That's 13 steps. Is there a way to shorten it?

Wait, after step 6 (in room_1), do we need to return to room_2 immediately? If the plan can proceed from room_1 to room_3 via yellow_door_1 (if unlocked). But yellow_door_1 is locked. So to unlock it, need to be in front of it. But that would require more steps. So perhaps not.

Alternatively, after step 6 (in room_1), we could go back to room_2 via purple_door_1 (step 7), then proceed to pick up red_box_1, etc. So steps 1-13 as above.

I think this is the minimal path. Now, let's write the plan in the required format.
