Alright, let's analyze this problem step-by-step:

1. Initial State:
   - We start in room_4.
   - There are various objects in different rooms.
   - All doors are locked.
   - We're not holding any object.

2. Goal:
   - To be in front of a yellow door (which can be either yellow_door_1 or yellow_door_2) and the door should not be locked.

3. Constraints:
   - We need to ensure yellow_door_2 is unlocked at some point.
   - Before yellow_door_2 is unlocked, we must have been holding red_box_1.
   - We need to ensure green_door_1 is unlocked at some point.
   - We need to hold red_box_1 at some point.
   - At some point, either we're holding red_box_1 or red_box_1 is in room_4.
   - At some point, either grey_box_1 is in room_4 or we're holding some object.
   - We need to be in front of yellow_door_2 at some point.
   - Before being in front of yellow_door_2, we need to have been holding some object.
   - At some point, either we're holding some object or we're in room_1.
   - We need to be in room_1 at some point.
   - We need to be in front of green_door_1 at some point.
   - We need to be holding some object at some point.

Let's start by understanding the connections between rooms and thinking about a possible plan:

- Room_1 is connected to Room_2 via purple_door_1.
- Room_1 is connected to Room_3 via yellow_door_1.
- Room_2 is connected to Room_4 via green_door_1.
- Room_3 is connected to Room_4 via yellow_door_2.

Currently, all doors are locked. To reach our goal, we need to toggle (unlock) a yellow door and be in front of it.

Let's think about a possible plan:

1. We start in room_4.
2. We'll need to pick up an object first (constraint: "We need to be holding some object at some point").
3. From the constraints, we specifically need to hold red_box_1 at some point.
4. red_box_1 is in room_2, so we need to go to room_2. We need to unlock green_door_1 to do this.
5. We'll need to go in front of green_door_1 and toggle it.
6. Then, go to room_2 and pick up red_box_1.
7. We need to be in room_1 at some point, so we'll need to go to room_1 from room_2 via purple_door_1, which we'll need to toggle.
8. After that, we need to go to room_3 from room_1 via yellow_door_1, which we'll need to toggle.
9. Then, go to room_4 from room_3 via yellow_door_2, which we'll need to toggle.
10. Finally, we'll meet the goal: be in front of a yellow door that's unlocked.

Let's detail this plan more precisely:

1. We start in room_4. First, we need to pick up an object. There are blue_ball_1, red_ball_1, and blue_ball_2 in room_4. Any of these would do.
2. Go to blue_ball_1: `gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_4`.
3. Pick up blue_ball_1: `pick blue_ball_1 room_4`.
4. Go to green_door_1: `gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2`.
5. Toggle green_door_1: `toggle green_door_1`.
6. Go to room_2: `gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_1`.
7. Drop blue_ball_1 (as we'll need to pick up red_box_1): `gotoempty`, then `drop blue_ball_1 room_2`.
8. Go to red_box_1: `gotoobject red_box_1 room_2`.
9. Pick up red_box_1: `pick red_box_1 room_2`.
10. Go to purple_door_1: `gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1`.
11. Toggle purple_door_1: `toggle purple_door_1`.
12. Go to room_1: `gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1`.
13. Now, to go to room_3, we need to unlock yellow_door_1: `gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3`.
14. Toggle yellow_door_1: `toggle yellow_door_1`.
15. Now we have a choice: Either drop red_box_1 in room_1 and be in front of yellow_door_1 (which is now unlocked) to satisfy the goal, or continue with the plan to go to room_3 and then to room_4 via yellow_door_2.

Actually from the constraints, it seems like we need to unlock yellow_door_2 after we have held red_box_1, so let's continue our plan:

16. Go to room_3: `gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1`.
17. Go to yellow_door_2: `gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_3 room_4`.
18. Toggle yellow_door_2: `toggle yellow_door_2`.

Now we have yellow_door_2 unlocked, and we're in front of it, which satisfies our goal. This also satisfies the constraint that yellow_door_2 was unlocked after holding red_box_1.

Let's review our plan against the constraints:

1. ✓ yellow_door_2 is unlocked at some point.
2. ✓ Before yellow_door_2 is unlocked, we held red_box_1.
3. ✓ green_door_1 is unlocked at some point.
4. ✓ We held red_box_1 at some point.
5. ✓ At some point, we held red_box_1.
6. ✓ At some point, we're holding an object (red_box_1).
7. ✓ We're in front of yellow_door_2 at some point.
8. ✓ Before being in front of yellow_door_2, we held an object (red_box_1).
9. ✓ At some point, we're holding an object (red_box_1).
10. ✓ We're in room_1 at some point.
11. ✓ We're in front of green_door_1 at some point.
12. ✓ We're holding an object at some point.

All constraints are satisfied by this plan. Let's finalize our plan:

1. `gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_4`
2. `pick blue_ball_1 room_4`
3. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2`
4. `toggle green_door_1`
5. `gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_1`
6. `gotoempty`
7. `drop blue_ball_1 room_2`
8. `gotoobject red_box_1 room_2`
9. `pick red_box_1 room_2`
10. `gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1`
11. `toggle purple_door_1`
12. `gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1`
13. `gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3`
14. `toggle yellow_door_1`
15. `gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1`
16. `gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_3 room_4`
17. `toggle yellow_door_2`

Now, I'm in front of yellow_door_2, which is unlocked, satisfying the goal.

Wait, let me double-check if our plan is optimal and if there's any room for improvement.

Actually, I notice that steps 6 and 7 (dropping blue_ball_1) might be unnecessary. We can just hold blue_ball_1 until we need to pick up red_box_1. Let's refine our plan:

1. `gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_4`
2. `pick blue_ball_1 room_4`
3. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2`
4. `toggle green_door_1`
5. `gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_1`
6. `gotoempty`
7. `drop blue_ball_1 room_2`
8. `gotoobject red_box_1 room_2`
9. `pick red_box_1 room_2`
10. `gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1`
11. `toggle purple_door_1`
12. `gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1`
13. `gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3`
14. `toggle yellow_door_1`
15. `gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1`
16. `gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_3 room_4`
17. `toggle yellow_door_2`

Actually, I don't think I can omit steps 6 and 7. From the preconditions of the "pick" action, I can only pick up an object if I'm not currently holding any object. So, I need to drop blue_ball_1 before I can pick up red_box_1.

Is there any other way to optimize the plan? Maybe I can directly pick up red_ball_1 in room_4, which would save me from having to pick up blue_ball_1 and then drop it. Let's refine our plan again:

1. `gotoobject red_ball_1 room_4`
2. `pick red_ball_1 room_4`
3. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2`
4. `toggle green_door_1`
5. `gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_1`
6. `gotoempty`
7. `drop red_ball_1 room_2`
8. `gotoobject red_box_1 room_2`
9. `pick red_box_1 room_2`
10. `gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1`
11. `toggle purple_door_1`
12. `gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1`
13. `gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3`
14. `toggle yellow_door_1`
15. `gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1`
16. `gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_3 room_4`
17. `toggle yellow_door_2`

This plan is still the same length as the previous one, just swapping `blue_ball_1` for `red_ball_1`. I don't think we can optimize this any further.

Actually, wait, can I just use red_box_1 directly to unlock doors? If so, I wouldn't need to pick up any other object.

1. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2`
2. `toggle green_door_1`
3. `gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_1`
4. `gotoobject red_box_1 room_2`
5. `pick red_box_1 room_2`
6. `gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1`
7. `toggle purple_door_1`
8. `gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1`
9. `gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3`
10. `toggle yellow_door_1`
11. `gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1`
12. `gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_3 room_4`
13. `toggle yellow_door_2`

This is more optimized and should satisfy all the constraints.

Actually, I need to reconsider the preconditions for the "toggle" action. The precondition says: "you may only toggle a door d if you are in front of d."

It doesn't say we need an object to toggle a door. So, I can toggle the doors without holding anything.

But one of the constraints says: "Before being in front of yellow_door_2, we need to have been holding some object." So, at some point before I'm in front of yellow_door_2, I need to have held an object. I can satisfy this by picking up red_box_1 in room_2, as I already planned.

So, the plan remains:

1. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2`
2. `toggle green_door_1`
3. `gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_1`
4. `gotoobject red_box_1 room_2`
5. `pick red_box_1 room_2`
6. `gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1`
7. `toggle purple_door_1`
8. `gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1`
9. `gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3`
10. `toggle yellow_door_1`
11. `gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1`
12. `gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_3 room_4`
13. `toggle yellow_door_2`

This plan is the most optimized and should satisfy all the constraints. The goal is to be in front of a yellow door that's unlocked, which we achieve by being in front of yellow_door_2 and unlocking it.

Actually, one more constraint I need to check is: "At some point, either grey_box_1 is in room_4 or we're holding some object."

Grey_box_1 starts in room_3 and our plan doesn't involve moving it to room_4. But, the constraint can be satisfied by us holding an object, which we do (red_box_1).

Let's review the plan one last time against the constraints:

1. ✓ yellow_door_2 is unlocked at some point (step 13).
2. ✓ Before yellow_door_2 is unlocked, we held red_box_1 (steps 5-13).
3. ✓ green_door_1 is unlocked at some point (step 2).
4. ✓ We held red_box_1 at some point (step 5).
5. ✓ At some point, we held red_box_1 (step 5).
6. ✓ At some point, we're holding an object (red_box_1 from step 5).
7. ✓ We're in front of yellow_door_2 at some point (step 12).
8. ✓ Before being in front of yellow_door_2, we held an object (red_box_1 from step 5).
9. ✓ At some point, we're holding an object (red_box_1 from step 5).
10. ✓ We're in room_1 at some point (step 8).
11. ✓ We're in front of green_door_1 at some point (step 1).
12. ✓ We're holding an object at some point (red_box_1 from step 5).

All constraints are satisfied by this plan. The plan is:

1. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2`
2. `toggle green_door_1`
3. `gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_1`
4. `gotoobject red_box_1 room_2`
5. `pick red_box_1 room_2`
6. `gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1`
7. `toggle purple_door_1`
8. `gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1`
9. `gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3`
10. `toggle yellow_door_1`
11. `gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1`
12. `gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_3 room_4`
13. `toggle yellow_door_2`

Actually, there's one constraint I missed: "At some point, either red_box_1 is in room_4 or we're holding red_box_1."

Our plan has us holding red_box_1, but we've never placed it in room_4. But since the constraint is an OR condition, and we are holding red_box_1 at some point (step 5), this constraint is satisfied.

So, our final plan is:

1. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2`
2. `toggle green_door_1`
3. `gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_1`
4. `gotoobject red_box_1 room_2`
5. `pick red_box_1 room_2`
6. `gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1`
7. `toggle purple_door_1`
8. `gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1`
9. `gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3`
10. `toggle yellow_door_1`
11. `gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1`
12. `gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_3 room_4`
13. `toggle yellow_door_2`
