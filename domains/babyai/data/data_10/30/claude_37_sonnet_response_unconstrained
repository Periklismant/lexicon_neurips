Let me analyze the problem:

1. I am currently in room_4.
2. I need to be in front of a yellow door that is unlocked.
3. There are two yellow doors:
   - yellow_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3
   - yellow_door_2 connects room_3 and room_4
4. Both yellow doors are initially locked.

So to achieve my goal, I need to:
1. Navigate to a yellow door (either yellow_door_1 or yellow_door_2)
2. Unlock it by performing the "toggle" action
3. Position myself in front of the unlocked yellow door

Let's plan for the closest yellow door, which is yellow_door_2 connecting room_3 and room_4.

Since I'm in room_4, I need to:
1. Go in front of yellow_door_2
2. Toggle it to unlock it
3. Stay in front of it

Let's see if I can execute this plan:

1. "gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_3" - Go in front of yellow_door_2 from room_4
2. "toggle yellow_door_2" - Unlock yellow_door_2
3. Done - I'm now in front of an unlocked yellow door

Let me verify that this plan meets the goal:
- I need to be in front of a yellow door.
- The door needs to be unlocked.

After executing these actions, I'll be in front of yellow_door_2, which is yellow, and I will have unlocked it.

So the plan is:
```
gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_3
toggle yellow_door_2
```

Wait, let me double-check the preconditions for "gotodoor" to make sure I can execute this plan:

"goto door": you may only go in front of a door d if 
(i) you are in a room which door d is connecting with another room, and 
(ii) there is no object blocking the position in front of d in the room you are currently in.

I am in room_4, and yellow_door_2 connects room_4 and room_3. There's no mention of any object blocking the door, so I should be able to go in front of it.

I think this plan should work, but let me think if there's any other approach or if I missed something.

Actually, let me be extra careful and check if there are any objects blocking doors. The problem description doesn't explicitly mention any objects blocking doors, so I should be able to navigate to the door.

The final plan is:
```
gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_3
toggle yellow_door_2
```

This should achieve the goal of being in front of an unlocked yellow door.
