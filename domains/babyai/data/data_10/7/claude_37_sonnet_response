Let's break down this planning problem to understand what I need to do:

1. The goal is to be in front of a purple ball.
2. There are constraints I must follow, some of which must hold in every state, and some that must hold in at least one state during the plan execution.

Let's start by analyzing the constraints:

Constraints that must hold in every state:
- "purple_door_1 is locked": This means I cannot unlock purple_door_1 at any point in the plan.
- "you are not in room_1": I cannot enter room_1 at any point in the plan.

Constraints that must hold in at least one state:
- "you are holding blue_ball_1": At some point, I need to pick up blue_ball_1.
- "grey_door_1 is not locked and blue_door_1 is not locked": At some point, both grey_door_1 and blue_door_1 must be unlocked.
- "you are in room_3": At some point, I need to be in room_3.
- "you are holding purple_ball_2 and red_box_2 is in room_2": At some point, I need to hold purple_ball_2 while red_box_2 is in room_2.
- "you are in room_2": At some point, I need to be in room_2 (which I already am in the initial state).

There's also a conditional constraint:
- If "you are in room_2" holds, then "you are holding purple_ball_2 and blue_door_1 is not locked" must hold in the same state or some later state. This means that once I'm in room_2, I must eventually pick up purple_ball_2 and ensure blue_door_1 is unlocked.

Let's think about the goal: being in front of a purple ball. There are two purple balls in the world: purple_ball_1 in room_1 and purple_ball_2 in room_3. Since I can't enter room_1 (due to the constraint), I must aim to be in front of purple_ball_2 in room_3.

Now, let's work out the plan:

1. I start in room_2. I need to reach room_3 to get purple_ball_2. But there's no direct route from room_2 to room_3.
2. I can either go room_2 -> room_1 -> room_3 or room_2 -> room_4 -> room_3.
3. Since I can't enter room_1 (constraint), I must go via room_4.
4. But I also have a constraint that I need to hold purple_ball_2 while red_box_2 is in room_2. red_box_2 is initially in room_4, so I need to move it to room_2.
5. To reach room_4, I need to unlock grey_door_1. And to reach room_3 from room_4, I need to unlock purple_door_2.
6. I also need to unlock blue_door_1 at some point (though I won't use it).

Let's try to formulate a plan:

1. Unlock grey_door_1 to access room_4.
2. Go to room_4.
3. Pick up red_box_2.
4. Return to room_2 and drop red_box_2.
5. Go back to room_4 to eventually access room_3.
6. Unlock purple_door_2 to access room_3.
7. Go to room_3.
8. There's blue_door_1, which I should unlock to fulfill the constraint (although I won't use it).
9. Go to purple_ball_2 in room_3.
10. Pick up purple_ball_2. This also fulfills the constraint that at some point I'm holding purple_ball_2 while red_box_2 is in room_2.
11. Go to blue_ball_1 in room_2.
12. Pick up blue_ball_1 to fulfill the constraint that at some point I'm holding it.
13. Return to room_3 and drop blue_ball_1.
14. Go to purple_ball_2 and drop it.
15. Go in front of purple_ball_2 to fulfill the goal.

Actually, I need to be more careful about the ordering. Let's try again:

I start in room_2 and my goal is to be in front of purple_ball_2. Let's revise the plan:

1. In room_2, I'll go to blue_ball_1 and pick it up (to fulfill the constraint that at some point I'm holding blue_ball_1).
2. I'll go to the door grey_door_1 and unlock it (this starts to fulfill the constraint that at some point grey_door_1 and blue_door_1 are unlocked).
3. I'll go to room_4 via grey_door_1.
4. I'll go to red_box_2 and pick it up.
5. I'll go back to room_2 via grey_door_1 and drop red_box_2 (this prepares for the constraint that at some point I'm holding purple_ball_2 while red_box_2 is in room_2).
6. I'll go back to room_4 via grey_door_1.
7. I'll go to the door purple_door_2 and unlock it.
8. I'll go to room_3 via purple_door_2.
9. I'll go to the door blue_door_1 and unlock it (this completes the constraint that at some point grey_door_1 and blue_door_1 are unlocked).
10. I'll go to purple_ball_2 and pick it up.
11. At this point, I'm holding purple_ball_2 and red_box_2 is in room_2, which fulfills that constraint.
12. I also have the constraint that if I'm in room_2, I must eventually hold purple_ball_2 and blue_door_1 must be unlocked. I've unlocked blue_door_1 in step 9, so if I go back to room_2 while holding purple_ball_2, I'll satisfy this constraint.
13. Actually for simplicity, I can take a simpler approach and just go back to room_3, go to purple_ball_2, drop it, and then go in front of it to fulfill the goal. I need to make sure I've fulfilled the constraint about being in room_2 while holding purple_ball_2 and blue_door_1 is unlocked. Let me check the initial state again... Yes, I was originally in room_2, so I'll satisfy this constraint if I re-enter room_2 while holding purple_ball_2 and after unlocking blue_door_1.

With this in mind, let's reformulate the plan:

1. In room_2, I'll go to blue_ball_1 and pick it up.
2. I'll go to the door grey_door_1 and unlock it.
3. I'll go to room_4 via grey_door_1.
4. I'll go to red_box_2 and pick it up.
5. I'll go back to room_2 via grey_door_1 and drop red_box_2.
6. I'll go back to room_4 via grey_door_1.
7. I'll go to the door purple_door_2 and unlock it.
8. I'll go to room_3 via purple_door_2.
9. I'll go to the door blue_door_1 and unlock it.
10. I'll go to purple_ball_2 and pick it up.
11. I'll go back to room_2 via grey_door_1 (which is a valid route: room_3 -> room_4 -> room_2) while holding purple_ball_2 (this fulfills the conditional constraint).
12. Ah, I just realized there's a problem. If I'm holding purple_ball_2, I can't pick up blue_ball_1. Let me rethink the plan...

Actually, this is a bit trickier than I initially thought. Let's first make sure I understand the layout of the rooms:
- room_1 (NW) and room_2 (SW) are connected by purple_door_1, which must remain locked.
- room_1 (NW) and room_3 (NE) are connected by blue_door_1, which I need to unlock at some point.
- room_2 (SW) and room_4 (SE) are connected by grey_door_1, which I need to unlock at some point.
- room_3 (NE) and room_4 (SE) are connected by purple_door_2, which I need to unlock to reach room_3.

I start in room_2, and I can't enter room_1. So I need to go from room_2 to room_4 to room_3 to reach purple_ball_2. And I also need to ensure I'm holding purple_ball_2 at some point while red_box_2 is in room_2, and I need to hold blue_ball_1 at some point.

Ok, let's trace through a clearer plan now:

1. In room_2, go to blue_ball_1.
2. Pick up blue_ball_1 (this fulfills the constraint that at some point I'm holding blue_ball_1).
3. Go to the door grey_door_1.
4. Toggle grey_door_1 to unlock it.
5. Go to room_4 via grey_door_1.
6. Go to red_box_2.
7. Drop blue_ball_1.
8. Pick up red_box_2.
9. Go to the door grey_door_1.
10. Go to room_2 via grey_door_1.
11. Drop red_box_2 (so now red_box_2 is in room_2).
12. Go to the door grey_door_1.
13. Go to room_4 via grey_door_1.
14. Go to blue_ball_1.
15. Pick up blue_ball_1.
16. Go to the door purple_door_2.
17. Toggle purple_door_2 to unlock it.
18. Go to room_3 via purple_door_2.
19. Go to the door blue_door_1.
20. Toggle blue_door_1 to unlock it (this fulfills the constraint that at some point both grey_door_1 and blue_door_1 are unlocked, and also prepares for the conditional constraint).
21. Go to purple_ball_2.
22. Drop blue_ball_1.
23. Pick up purple_ball_2.
24. Go to the door purple_door_2.
25. Go to room_4 via purple_door_2.
26. Go to the door grey_door_1.
27. Go to room_2 via grey_door_1 (this fulfills the conditional constraint: I'm in room_2, holding purple_ball_2, and blue_door_1 is unlocked). It also fulfills the constraint that at some point I'm holding purple_ball_2 while red_box_2 is in room_2.
28. Go to the door grey_door_1.
29. Go to room_4 via grey_door_1.
30. Go to the door purple_door_2.
31. Go to room_3 via purple_door_2.
32. Go to blue_ball_1.
33. Drop purple_ball_2.
34. Go to purple_ball_2 (this fulfills the goal: I'm in front of a purple ball, specifically purple_ball_2).

Wait, there's an issue. In room_3, if I've placed blue_ball_1 at a particular spot, I can't place purple_ball_2 there as well. Let me double-check the actions for dropping an object: "drop: you may only drop an object x if (i) you are currently holding x, and (ii) the position in front of you is empty."

So, I can drop an object to have it in front of me. I need to be more precise about the layout. Let's revise the plan:

1. In room_2, go to blue_ball_1.
2. Pick up blue_ball_1.
3. Go to the door grey_door_1.
4. Toggle grey_door_1 to unlock it.
5. Go to room_4 via grey_door_1.
6. Go to red_box_2.
7. Drop blue_ball_1 (now blue_ball_1 is in front of me, but I need to move away to pick up red_box_2).
8. Go to red_box_2 (this puts me in front of red_box_2 and no longer in front of blue_ball_1).
9. Pick up red_box_2.
10. Go to the door grey_door_1.
11. Go to room_2 via grey_door_1.
12. Go to an empty position.
13. Drop red_box_2 (so now red_box_2 is in room_2).
14. Go to the door grey_door_1.
15. Go to room_4 via grey_door_1.
16. Go to blue_ball_1.
17. Pick up blue_ball_1.
18. Go to the door purple_door_2.
19. Toggle purple_door_2 to unlock it.
20. Go to room_3 via purple_door_2.
21. Go to the door blue_door_1.
22. Toggle blue_door_1 to unlock it.
23. Go to purple_ball_2.
24. Go to an empty position.
25. Drop blue_ball_1 (now blue_ball_1 is in front of me and I'm no longer in front of purple_ball_2).
26. Go to purple_ball_2.
27. Pick up purple_ball_2.
28. Go to the door purple_door_2.
29. Go to room_4 via purple_door_2.
30. Go to the door grey_door_1.
31. Go to room_2 via grey_door_1 (I'm in room_2, holding purple_ball_2, and blue_door_1 is unlocked). I've also satisfied the constraint that at some point I'm holding purple_ball_2 while red_box_2 is in room_2.
32. Go to the door grey_door_1.
33. Go to room_4 via grey_door_1.
34. Go to the door purple_door_2.
35. Go to room_3 via purple_door_2.
36. Go to blue_ball_1.
37. Go to an empty position.
38. Drop purple_ball_2 (now purple_ball_2 is in front of me).
39. Go to purple_ball_2 (this fulfills the goal: I'm in front of a purple ball, specifically purple_ball_2).

Wait, the action "gotoempty" makes me go in front of an empty position. So, by using "gotoempty" and then "drop", the object is not necessarily in front of me, but it's in the room at an empty position.

Let me revise again.

Hm, let me look at the action effects more closely: "drop: After performing this action regarding an object x, (i) you are no longer carrying x, (ii) you are in front of x, (iii) your hands are empty, and (iv) object x is situated in the room you are currently in."

So, the "drop" action puts the object in front of me. And I need to be in front of an empty position to drop an object. With this understanding, let's revise once more:

1. In room_2, go to blue_ball_1 (using "gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_2").
2. Pick up blue_ball_1 (using "pick blue_ball_1 room_2").
3. Go to the door grey_door_1 (using "gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_4").
4. Toggle grey_door_1 to unlock it (using "toggle grey_door_1").
5. Go to room_4 via grey_door_1 (using "gotoroom room_2 room_4 grey_door_1").
6. Go to red_box_2 (using "gotoobject red_box_2 room_4").
7. Go to an empty position (using "gotoempty").
8. Drop blue_ball_1 (using "drop blue_ball_1 room_4"). Now blue_ball_1 is in room_4, and I'm in front of it.
9. Go to red_box_2 (using "gotoobject red_box_2 room_4").
10. Pick up red_box_2 (using "pick red_box_2 room_4").
11. Go to the door grey_door_1 (using "gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_2").
12. Go to room_2 via grey_door_1 (using "gotoroom room_4 room_2 grey_door_1").
13. Go to an empty position (using "gotoempty").
14. Drop red_box_2 (using "drop red_box_2 room_2"). Now red_box_2 is in room_2, and I'm in front of it.
15. Go to the door grey_door_1 (using "gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_4").
16. Go to room_4 via grey_door_1 (using "gotoroom room_2 room_4 grey_door_1").
17. Go to blue_ball_1 (using "gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_4").
18. Pick up blue_ball_1 (using "pick blue_ball_1 room_4").
19. Go to the door purple_door_2 (using "gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_3").
20. Toggle purple_door_2 to unlock it (using "toggle purple_door_2").
21. Go to room_3 via purple_door_2 (using "gotoroom room_4 room_3 purple_door_2").
22. Go to the door blue_door_1 (using "gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_1").
23. Toggle blue_door_1 to unlock it (using "toggle blue_door_1"). Now, both grey_door_1 and blue_door_1 are unlocked, which fulfills one constraint.
24. Go to purple_ball_2 (using "gotoobject purple_ball_2 room_3").
25. Go to an empty position (using "gotoempty").
26. Drop blue_ball_1 (using "drop blue_ball_1 room_3"). Now blue_ball_1 is in room_3, and I'm in front of it.
27. Go to purple_ball_2 (using "gotoobject purple_ball_2 room_3").
28. Pick up purple_ball_2 (using "pick purple_ball_2 room_3").
29. Go to the door purple_door_2 (using "gotodoor purple_door_2 room_3 room_4").
30. Go to room_4 via purple_door_2 (using "gotoroom room_3 room_4 purple_door_2").
31. Go to the door grey_door_1 (using "gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_2").
32. Go to room_2 via grey_door_1 (using "gotoroom room_4 room_2 grey_door_1"). I'm now in room_2, holding purple_ball_2, and blue_door_1 is unlocked, which fulfills the conditional constraint. I'm also holding purple_ball_2 while red_box_2 is in room_2, which fulfills another constraint.
33. Go to the door grey_door_1 (using "gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_4").
34. Go to room_4 via grey_door_1 (using "gotoroom room_2 room_4 grey_door_1").
35. Go to the door purple_door_2 (using "gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_3").
36. Go to room_3 via purple_door_2 (using "gotoroom room_4 room_3 purple_door_2").
37. Go to an empty position (using "gotoempty").
38. Drop purple_ball_2 (using "drop purple_ball_2 room_3"). Now purple_ball_2 is in room_3, and I'm in front of it, which fulfills the goal.

Actually, we don't even need to move blue_ball_1 from room_2 to room_4. Let's simplify the plan:

1. In room_2, go to blue_ball_1 (using "gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_2").
2. Pick up blue_ball_1 (using "pick blue_ball_1 room_2"). This fulfills the constraint that at some point I'm holding blue_ball_1.
3. Go to the door grey_door_1 (using "gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_4").
4. Toggle grey_door_1 to unlock it (using "toggle grey_door_1").
5. Go to room_4 via grey_door_1 (using "gotoroom room_2 room_4 grey_door_1").
6. Go to red_box_2 (using "gotoobject red_box_2 room_4").
7. Go to an empty position (using "gotoempty").
8. Drop blue_ball_1 (using "drop blue_ball_1 room_4"). Now blue_ball_1 is in room_4, and I'm in front of it.
9. Go to red_box_2 (using "gotoobject red_box_2 room_4").
10. Pick up red_box_2 (using "pick red_box_2 room_4").
11. Go to the door grey_door_1 (using "gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_2").
12. Go to room_2 via grey_door_1 (using "gotoroom room_4 room_2 grey_door_1").
13. Go to an empty position (using "gotoempty").
14. Drop red_box_2 (using "drop red_box_2 room_2"). Now red_box_2 is in room_2, and I'm in front of it.
15. Go to the door grey_door_1 (using "gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_4").
16. Go to room_4 via grey_door_1 (using "gotoroom room_2 room_4 grey_door_1").
17. Go to the door purple_door_2 (using "gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_3").
18. Toggle purple_door_2 to unlock it (using "toggle purple_door_2").
19. Go to room_3 via purple_door_2 (using "gotoroom room_4 room_3 purple_door_2").
20. Go to the door blue_door_1 (using "gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_1").
21. Toggle blue_door_1 to unlock it (using "toggle blue_door_1"). Now, both grey_door_1 and blue_door_1 are unlocked, which fulfills one constraint.
22. Go to purple_ball_2 (using "gotoobject purple_ball_2 room_3").
23. Pick up purple_ball_2 (using "pick purple_ball_2 room_3").
24. Go to the door purple_door_2 (using "gotodoor purple_door_2 room_3 room_4").
25. Go to room_4 via purple_door_2 (using "gotoroom room_3 room_4 purple_door_2").
26. Go to the door grey_door_1 (using "gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_2").
27. Go to room_2 via grey_door_1 (using "gotoroom room_4 room_2 grey_door_1"). I'm now in room_2, holding purple_ball_2, and blue_door_1 is unlocked, which fulfills the conditional constraint. I'm also holding purple_ball_2 while red_box_2 is in room_2, which fulfills another constraint.
28. Go to the door grey_door_1 (using "gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_4").
29. Go to room_4 via grey_door_1 (using "gotoroom room_2 room_4 grey_door_1").
30. Go to the door purple_door_2 (using "gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_3").
31. Go to room_3 via purple_door_2 (using "gotoroom room_4 room_3 purple_door_2"). This fulfills the constraint that at some point I'm in room_3.
32. Go to an empty position (using "gotoempty").
33. Drop purple_ball_2 (using "drop purple_ball_2 room_3"). Now I'm in front of purple_ball_2.

Actually, I realized the last step can be even more direct. After dropping purple_ball_2, I'm already in front of it, so I've fulfilled the goal. The action says: "drop: After performing this action regarding an object x, (i) you are no longer carrying x, (ii) you are in front of x, (iii) your hands are empty, and (iv) object x is situated in the room you are currently in."

This gives us the following plan:

1. In room_2, go to blue_ball_1 (using "gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_2").
2. Pick up blue_ball_1 (using "pick blue_ball_1 room_2"). This fulfills the constraint that at some point I'm holding blue_ball_1.
3. Go to the door grey_door_1 (using "gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_4").
4. Toggle grey_door_1 to unlock it (using "toggle grey_door_1").
5. Go to room_4 via grey_door_1 (using "gotoroom room_2 room_4 grey_door_1").
6. Go to red_box_2 (using "gotoobject red_box_2 room_4").
7. Go to an empty position (using "gotoempty").
8. Drop blue_ball_1 (using "drop blue_ball_1 room_4"). Now blue_ball_1 is in room_4, and I'm in front of it.
9. Go to red_box_2 (using "gotoobject red_box_2 room_4").
10. Pick up red_box_2 (using "pick red_box_2 room_4").
11. Go to the door grey_door_1 (using "gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_2").
12. Go to room_2 via grey_door_1 (using "gotoroom room_4 room_2 grey_door_1"). This fulfills the constraint that at some point I'm in room_2.
13. Go to an empty position (using "gotoempty").
14. Drop red_box_2 (using "drop red_box_2 room_2"). Now red_box_2 is in room_2, and I'm in front of it.
15. Go to the door grey_door_1 (using "gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_4").
16. Go to room_4 via grey_door_1 (using "gotoroom room_2 room_4 grey_door_1").
17. Go to the door purple_door_2 (using "gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_3").
18. Toggle purple_door_2 to unlock it (using "toggle purple_door_2").
19. Go to room_3 via purple_door_2 (using "gotoroom room_4 room_3 purple_door_2"). This fulfills the constraint that at some point I'm in room_3.
20. Go to the door blue_door_1 (using "gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_1").
21. Toggle blue_door_1 to unlock it (using "toggle blue_door_1"). Now, both grey_door_1 and blue_door_1 are unlocked, which fulfills one constraint.
22. Go to purple_ball_2 (using "gotoobject purple_ball_2 room_3").
23. Pick up purple_ball_2 (using "pick purple_ball_2 room_3").
24. Go to the door purple_door_2 (using "gotodoor purple_door_2 room_3 room_4").
25. Go to room_4 via purple_door_2 (using "gotoroom room_3 room_4 purple_door_2").
26. Go to the door grey_door_1 (using "gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_2").
27. Go to room_2 via grey_door_1 (using "gotoroom room_4 room_2 grey_door_1"). I'm now in room_2, holding purple_ball_2, and blue_door_1 is unlocked, which fulfills the conditional constraint. I'm also holding purple_ball_2 while red_box_2 is in room_2, which fulfills another constraint.
28. Go to the door grey_door_1 (using "gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_4").
29. Go to room_4 via grey_door_1 (using "gotoroom room_2 room_4 grey_door_1").
30. Go to the door purple_door_2 (using "gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_3").
31. Go to room_3 via purple_door_2 (using "gotoroom room_4 room_3 purple_door_2").
32. Go to an empty position (using "gotoempty").
33. Drop purple_ball_2 (using "drop purple_ball_2 room_3"). After dropping, I'm in front of purple_ball_2, which fulfills the goal.

Let me check once more to make sure all the constraints are met during this plan:

1. "purple_door_1 is locked" holds in every state: Yes, I never unlock purple_door_1.
2. "you are holding blue_ball_1" holds in at least one state: Yes, after step 2.
3. "grey_door_1 is not locked, blue_door_1 is not locked" holds in at least one state: Yes, after step 21.
4. "you are in room_3" holds in at least one state: Yes, after step 19, and several times afterwards.
5. "you are not in room_1" holds in every state: Yes, I never enter room_1.
6. "you are holding purple_ball_2, red_box_2 is in room_2" holds in at least one state: Yes, after step 27.
7. "you are in room_2" holds in at least one state: Yes, this is the initial state, and I'm there several times throughout the plan.
8. Conditional constraint: If "you are in room_2" holds in some state s, then "you are holding purple_ball_2, blue_door_1 is not locked" must hold at s or some state after s: Yes, this is fulfilled by step 27, where I'm in room_2, holding purple_ball_2, and blue_door_1 is already unlocked.

So the plan satisfies all the constraints and achieves the goal.

Let's consolidate the plan in the format required:

```
gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_2
pick blue_ball_1 room_2
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_4
toggle grey_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_4 grey_door_1
gotoobject red_box_2 room_4
gotoempty
drop blue_ball_1 room_4
gotoobject red_box_2 room_4
pick red_box_2 room_4
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_2
gotoroom room_4 room_2 grey_door_1

Actually I need to check my solution a bit more. Let's go through the original state of the world again:
- "you are in room_2"
- "green_box_1 is in room_1"
- "red_box_1 is in room_1"
- "purple_ball_1 is in room_1"
- "blue_ball_1 is in room_2"
- "blue_ball_2 is in room_2"
- "purple_ball_2 is in room_3"
- "red_ball_1 is in room_3"
- "red_box_2 is in room_4"

Alright, so there are two blue balls: blue_ball_1 in room_2 and blue_ball_2 also in room_2. And there's a purple_ball_2 in room_3, which I need to be in front of for the goal.

Let me now check this with the constraints from the problem:

1. "purple_door_1 is locked" holds in every state: Yes, I never unlock purple_door_1 in my plan.
2. "you are holding blue_ball_1" holds in at least one state: Yes, after step 2 in my plan.
3. "grey_door_1 is not locked, blue_door_1 is not locked" holds in at least one state: Yes, after step 21 in my plan.
4. "you are in room_3" holds in at least one state: Yes, after step 19 in my plan.
5. "you are not in room_1" holds in every state: Yes, I never enter room_1 in my plan.
6. "you are holding purple_ball_2, red_box_2 is in room_2" holds in at least one state: Yes, after step 27 in my plan.
7. "you are in room_2" holds in at least one state: Yes, this is the initial state.
8. Conditional constraint: If "you are in room_2" holds in some state s, then "you are holding purple_ball_2, blue_door_1 is not locked" must hold at s or some state after s: Yes, this is fulfilled by step 27, where I'm in room_2, holding purple_ball_2, and blue_door_1 is already unlocked.

My plan meets all the constraints and achieves the goal.

Let's check once more with the action definitions:

- "gotoobject x r": Go in front of to object x in room r.
    - Precondition: you may only go in front of an object x if you are in the same room as x.
    
- "gotoempty": Go in front of an empty position of the room, which does not contain any object.
    - No specific preconditions stated.
    
- "gotodoor d r1 r2": Go in front of door d, connecting room r1 to room r2.
    - Precondition: you may only go in front of a door d if (i) you are in a room which door d is connecting with another room, and (ii) there is no object blocking the position in front of d in the room you are currently in.
    
- "gotoroom r1 r2 d": Go to room r2 from room r1 using door d.
    - Precondition: you may only go in a room r if (i) you are currently in a room r0 that is adjacent to r, and (ii) the door that is connecting r0 and r is unlocked.
    
- "pick x r": Pick up object x in room r.
    - Precondition: you may only pick up an object x if (i) you are in the same room as x, and (ii) you are currently not holding any object.
    
- "drop x r": Drop object x in room r.
    - Precondition: you may only drop an object x if (i) you are currently holding x, and (ii) the position in front of you is empty.
    
- "toggle d": Unlock door d if is locked. Lock door d if is unlocked.
    - Precondition: you may only toggle a door d if you are in front of d.

Let's go through the plan and check if it meets all the preconditions:

All preconditions are met at each step. The plan is valid.

Let's make sure that the goal is achieved:
- The goal is to be in front of a purple ball.
- After dropping purple_ball_2, I'm in front of it, which achieves the goal.

Alright, so my plan is:

```
gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_2
pick blue_ball_1 room_2
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_4
toggle grey_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_4 grey_door_1
gotoobject red_box_2 room_4
gotoempty
drop blue_ball_1 room_4
gotoobject red_box_2 room_4
pick red_box_2 room_4
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_2
gotoroom room_4 room_2 grey_door_1
gotoempty
drop red_box_2 room_2
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_4
gotoroom room_2 room_4 grey_door_1
gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_3
toggle purple_door_2
gotoroom room_4 room_3 purple_door_2
gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_1
toggle blue_door_1
gotoobject purple_ball_2 room_3
pick purple_ball_2 room_3
gotodoor purple_door_2 room_3 room_4
gotoroom room_3 room_4 purple_door_2
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_2
gotoroom room_4 room_2 grey_door_1
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_4
gotoroom room_2 room_4 grey_door_1
gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_3
gotoroom room_4 room_3 purple_door_2
gotoempty
drop purple_ball_2 room_3
```

This plan satisfies all the constraints and achieves the goal of being in front of purple_ball_2, a purple ball.
