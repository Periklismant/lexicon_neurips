Okay, let's try to tackle this planning problem. Hmm, the goal is to end up in front of a purple ball. The constraints are a bit tricky, so I need to make sure all of them are satisfied. Let me start by understanding the initial state and the goal.

First, the initial state: I'm in room_2. There are balls and boxes in various rooms. The purple balls are in room_1 (purple_ball_1) and room_3 (purple_ball_2). The goal is to be in front of a purple ball. But the constraints say I can never enter room_1. So, purple_ball_1 is in room_1, which I can't go to. Therefore, the target must be purple_ball_2 in room_3.

So I need to get to room_3 and be in front of purple_ball_2. But how do I get there from room_2? Let's check the doors. The doors connecting rooms:

- room_1 and room_2 via purple_door_1 (locked)
- room_1 and room_3 via blue_door_1 (locked)
- room_2 and room_4 via grey_door_1 (locked)
- room_3 and room_4 via purple_door_2 (locked)

Since I can't go into room_1, I can't use the blue_door_1 from room_1 to room_3. So the alternative path would be from room_2 to room_4 via grey_door_1, then room_4 to room_3 via purple_door_2. But both doors are locked. I need to unlock them. Wait, but the toggle action can unlock a door if I'm in front of it. However, to get in front of a door, there must be no object blocking it.

Wait, the preconditions for gotodoor: I can go to a door if I'm in a room connected by that door and there's no object blocking the position in front of the door in the current room. So for grey_door_1 in room_2, are there any objects blocking it? The initial state says room_2 has blue_ball_1 and blue_ball_2. If either is in front of the door, then I can't go to the door. But the problem doesn't specify positions, so maybe they aren't blocking. Assuming they aren't blocking, I can go to grey_door_1, toggle it to unlock, then go to room_4. Then from room_4, go to purple_door_2 (but need to check if any objects are blocking in room_4. Room_4 has red_box_2. If it's blocking purple_door_2, then I can't go to the door. Hmm, but the initial state doesn't mention any objects blocking doors. So maybe they're not blocking. Then I can toggle purple_door_2, unlock it, and go to room_3.

Once in room_3, I can go to purple_ball_2 and drop any object if needed, but the goal is just to be in front of it. Wait, no, the goal is to have a purple ball that I'm in front of. So perhaps I just need to gotoobject purple_ball_2 in room_3.

But wait, the constraints require that at some state, I'm holding purple_ball_2 and red_box_2 is in room_2. Also, another constraint says if I'm in room_2 at any state, then in that state or a later one, I must be holding purple_ball_2 and blue_door_1 is unlocked. Oh, that's a tricky one. So if I ever go back to room_2 after some point, I need to have those conditions met.

Let's outline the steps:

1. From room_2, go to grey_door_1 (room_2 to room_4). But first, need to unlock grey_door_1. So:

- gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_4
- toggle grey_door_1 (unlocks it)
- gotoroom room_2 room_4 grey_door_1 (now in room_4)
- Then, go to purple_door_2 (connecting room_4 and room_3). Need to unlock it:
- gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_3
- toggle purple_door_2 (unlocks it)
- gotoroom room_4 room_3 purple_door_2 (now in room_3)
- Then, gotoobject purple_ball_2 room_3. That would satisfy the goal.

But wait, the constraints:

- Must have in every state: purple_door_1 is locked. Since we never touch it, that's okay.

- Must hold blue_ball_1 at some state. So need to pick it up. But when? If I'm in room_2 initially, I can pick up blue_ball_1 before leaving. But the constraints also say that in some state, I must be holding purple_ball_2 and red_box_2 is in room_2. How does red_box_2 get to room_2? It's initially in room_4. So I need to move it. But how? To move red_box_2 from room_4 to room_2, I would have to pick it up in room_4, carry it through room_4 to room_2 via grey_door_1. But that requires multiple steps.

Wait, but the plan I outlined earlier doesn't involve moving red_box_2. So that's a problem. The constraint says that in at least one state, I must be holding purple_ball_2 and red_box_2 is in room_2. So how can red_box_2 be in room_2? It's initially in room_4. So I need to bring it to room_2. To do that, I need to go to room_4, pick up red_box_2, bring it back to room_2. But that requires going back to room_2, which triggers the constraint that if I'm in room_2, then in that state or after, I must be holding purple_ball_2 and blue_door_1 is unlocked. Hmm, this complicates things.

Let's break it down:

Constraints:

1. Always: purple_door_1 is locked. So no need to touch that door.

2. At some point: holding blue_ball_1.

3. At some point: grey_door_1 and blue_door_1 are both unlocked.

4. At some point: in room_3.

5. Always: not in room_1.

6. At some point: holding purple_ball_2 and red_box_2 is in room_2.

7. At some point: in room_2.

8. If in room_2 in state s, then in s or after, hold purple_ball_2 and blue_door_1 is unlocked.

So the plan must include steps that satisfy all these.

Let me try to sketch a path:

Start in room_2. Need to pick up blue_ball_1 at some point. Let's do that first.

Action: gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_2

Then pick it up: pick blue_ball_1 room_2. Now holding blue_ball_1. That satisfies constraint 2.

Then drop it somewhere else? Or carry it. But maybe better to drop it later.

But after that, need to go to room_4 via grey_door_1. But grey_door_1 is locked. So need to toggle it.

So:

1. gotoempty (to not be in front of anything, but maybe unnecessary. Wait, can I go to a door if I'm in the same room? So from room_2, gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_4.

But first, check if there's any object blocking the door. The initial state in room_2 has blue_ball_1 and blue_ball_2. Are they blocking the door? The problem doesn't specify positions, so assuming they are not. So proceed.

Action: gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_4.

Then toggle grey_door_1 to unlock it. Now grey_door_1 is unlocked. Then gotoroom room_2 room_4 grey_door_1. Now in room_4.

Now, red_box_2 is here. Need to pick it up and take it to room_2. But to do that, I need to:

In room_4, gotoobject red_box_2 room_4. Then pick it up. Then go back to room_2 via grey_door_1. But when returning to room_2, the constraint 8 applies: if I'm in room_2, then in that state or after, I must be holding purple_ball_2 and blue_door_1 is unlocked. But purple_ball_2 is in room_3. So how can I be holding it when I'm in room_2? That seems challenging.

Alternatively, perhaps after moving red_box_2 to room_2, but before returning to room_2, I need to go to room_3 to get purple_ball_2, then bring it to room_2. But that requires a path through room_4 to room_3.

Wait, let's think step by step.

After picking up red_box_2 in room_4, I need to drop it in room_2. So:

After getting to room_4:

gotoobject red_box_2 room_4

pick red_box_2 room_4

Now holding red_box_2.

Then, go back to room_2 via grey_door_1 (which is now unlocked). So:

gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_2 (wait, no. The gotoroom action is gotoroom r1 r2 d. So to go from room_4 to room_2 via grey_door_1, which connects room_2 and room_4. So in room_4, the door connects to room_2. So gotoroom room_4 room_2 grey_door_1.

But when entering room_2, the constraint 8 applies. So in that state, I must either be holding purple_ball_2 and blue_door_1 is unlocked, or achieve that in a later state.

But currently, I'm holding red_box_2. So I need to drop it in room_2. Then proceed to unlock blue_door_1 and get purple_ball_2.

Wait, but blue_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3. To unlock blue_door_1, I need to be in front of it. But blue_door_1 is in room_1 and room_3. I can't go to room_1 (constraint 5). So the only way is to be in room_3 and toggle blue_door_1 there.

So, after dropping red_box_2 in room_2, I need to go to room_3, unlock blue_door_1, then get purple_ball_2 and bring it to room_2.

But how to get to room_3 from room_2? The doors are:

From room_2, can go to room_4 via grey_door_1 (already unlocked). Then from room_4 to room_3 via purple_door_2. Which is locked. So need to unlock purple_door_2.

So the steps would be:

1. In room_2, pick up blue_ball_1 (to satisfy constraint 2).

2. Unlock grey_door_1 and go to room_4.

3. In room_4, pick up red_box_2 and bring it back to room_2.

4. Drop red_box_2 in room_2.

5. Now, need to get to room_3. To do that, from room_2, go back to room_4, unlock purple_door_2, go to room_3.

But that's a long path. Let's see:

After dropping red_box_2 in room_2, go to room_4 again via grey_door_1 (already unlocked). Then in room_4, go to purple_door_2 (connecting to room_3). Unlock it, then go to room_3. Now in room_3.

In room_3, unlock blue_door_1 (since blue_door_1 is locked initially). But blue_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3. So in room_3, gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_1. Then toggle to unlock it. Now, blue_door_1 is unlocked. This satisfies constraint 3 (grey_door_1 and blue_door_1 unlocked at some point). Because grey_door_1 was unlocked earlier, and blue_door_1 is now unlocked.

Then, pick up purple_ball_2 in room_3. Then go back to room_4, then room_2. But when entering room_2 again, we need to have purple_ball_2 and blue_door_1 unlocked. Which they are.

So putting it all together:

Initial steps:

1. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_2

2. pick blue_ball_1 room_2 (satisfies constraint 2)

3. drop blue_ball_1 room_2 (so that hands are free for other actions)

Wait, but maybe not necessary. Let's see:

But after picking blue_ball_1, we need to carry it until we can drop it. But perhaps it's better to drop it immediately to free hands.

Alternatively, perhaps keep it to drop later. But let's see.

Next steps:

4. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_4

5. toggle grey_door_1 (unlocks it, so now grey_door_1 is unlocked. This helps with constraint 3, but need blue_door_1 also to be unlocked. So later steps will handle that.

6. gotoroom room_2 room_4 grey_door_1 (now in room_4)

7. gotoobject red_box_2 room_4

8. pick red_box_2 room_4 (now holding red_box_2)

9. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_2

10. gotoroom room_4 room_2 grey_door_1 (back in room_2, now holding red_box_2. But constraint 8: when in room_2, need to either in this state or later have purple_ball_2 and blue_door_1 unlocked. So need to plan for that.

So, after step 10, we are in room_2 holding red_box_2. We need to drop it here to satisfy constraint 6 (at some point, holding purple_ball_2 and red_box_2 is in room_2). But currently, we're holding red_box_2, so dropping it here would place it in room_2. So:

11. drop red_box_2 room_2 (now red_box_2 is in room_2, satisfying part of constraint 6. But need to hold purple_ball_2 at some point. Also, constraint 8 requires that when in room_2 (which we are now), in this state or later, we must be holding purple_ball_2 and blue_door_1 is unlocked. So we need to ensure that after this, we eventually unlock blue_door_1 and get purple_ball_2.

So next steps would be to go to room_3 via room_4 and unlock blue_door_1 and get purple_ball_2.

12. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_4

13. gotoroom room_2 room_4 grey_door_1 (back in room_4)

14. gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_3

15. toggle purple_door_2 (unlocks it)

16. gotoroom room_4 room_3 purple_door_2 (now in room_3)

Now in room_3, need to unlock blue_door_1.

17. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_1

18. toggle blue_door_1 (unlocks it. Now blue_door_1 is unlocked. This, along with grey_door_1 being unlocked, satisfies constraint 3.)

19. gotoobject purple_ball_2 room_3

20. pick purple_ball_2 room_3 (now holding it. This satisfies part of constraint 6.)

Now, need to go back to room_2. So:

21. gotodoor purple_door_2 room_3 room_4

22. gotoroom room_3 room_4 purple_door_2 (in room_4 again)

23. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_2

24. gotoroom room_4 room_2 grey_door_1 (back in room_2. Now, in this state, we are holding purple_ball_2, and blue_door_1 is unlocked. So constraint 8 is satisfied here.)

Now, the goal is to be in front of a purple ball. Since we are holding purple_ball_2, we need to drop it to be in front of it. But the goal requires that "there is a ball v such that you are in front of v and v is purple". So dropping it in room_2 would achieve that. However, we need to be in front of it. So after dropping, we would be in front of it.

So:

25. drop purple_ball_2 room_2 (now, in front of it. This satisfies the goal.)

But wait, after dropping, according to the drop effect: (i) you are no longer carrying x, (ii) you are in front of x. So yes, after dropping, you are in front of it. So the goal is achieved.

But let's check if all constraints are met:

- Always: purple_door_1 is locked. Yes, never touched.

- At some point: holding blue_ball_1. Yes, step 2.

- At some point: grey_door_1 and blue_door_1 unlocked. Yes, after steps 5 (grey) and 18 (blue).

- At some point: in room_3. Yes, step 16.

- Always: not in room_1. Correct.

- At some point: holding purple_ball_2 and red_box_2 in room_2. Yes, step 20 (holding purple_ball_2) and after step 11, red_box_2 is in room_2. But need to be holding purple_ball_2 and red_box_2 in room_2 at the same time. Wait, the constraint says "The following conditions are all true: "you are holding purple_ball_2", "red_box_2 is in room_2". So in step 20, when we are holding purple_ball_2, red_box_2 is already in room_2 (from step 11). So that state satisfies this constraint.

- At some point: in room_2. Yes, steps 1-3, 10-11, 24-25.

- If in room_2 (steps 10, 11, 24,25), then in that state or after, hold purple_ball_2 and blue_door_1 unlocked. In step 24, when returning to room_2, we are holding purple_ball_2 and blue_door_1 was unlocked in step 18. So this is satisfied.

Now, let's check the plan steps:

But wait, when we drop purple_ball_2 in room_2 (step 25), we are in front of it, so that satisfies the goal. But need to make sure that the final state has the agent in front of a purple ball.

But according to the drop action, after dropping, you are in front of x. So yes, step 25 would be the final action.

So the plan would look like:

1. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_2

2. pick blue_ball_1 room_2

3. drop blue_ball_1 room_2

4. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_4

5. toggle grey_door_1

6. gotoroom room_2 room_4 grey_door_1

7. gotoobject red_box_2 room_4

8. pick red_box_2 room_4

9. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_2

10. gotoroom room_4 room_2 grey_door_1

11. drop red_box_2 room_2

12. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_4

13. gotoroom room_2 room_4 grey_door_1

14. gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_3

15. toggle purple_door_2

16. gotoroom room_4 room_3 purple_door_2

17. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_1

18. toggle blue_door_1

19. gotoobject purple_ball_2 room_3

20. pick purple_ball_2 room_3

21. gotodoor purple_door_2 room_3 room_4

22. gotoroom room_3 room_4 purple_door_2

23. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_2

24. gotoroom room_4 room_2 grey_door_1

25. drop purple_ball_2 room_2

But wait, step 3: dropping blue_ball_1 may not be necessary. If we can carry it through, but since we need to pick up red_box_2 later, we need to drop it. So step 3 is needed.

But this plan seems long. Maybe there's a shorter way. Let's see if some steps can be optimized.

Alternative approach: After picking up red_box_2 and dropping it in room_2, when going to room_3, can we avoid going back to room_4 again? Let's see.

Wait, after dropping red_box_2 in room_2 (step 11), the next step is to go to room_4 (steps 12-13), then to room_3 via purple_door_2. Then unlock blue_door_1, pick purple_ball_2, return to room_4, then room_2. That's necessary.

Alternatively, is there a way to go from room_2 to room_3 directly? No, because the doors between room_1 and room_3 are blue_door_1, but we can't go through room_1.

So the path is necessary.

But perhaps steps can be optimized. For example, after step 5 (unlocking grey_door_1), when going to room_4, can we immediately go to purple_door_2, unlock it, and proceed to room_3 before handling red_box_2?

But then we need to bring red_box_2 to room_2, which would require going back to room_4 again. So perhaps not better.

Alternatively, maybe we can handle unlocking blue_door_1 before moving red_box_2. Let's see:

Another approach:

1. Unlock grey_door_1, go to room_4.

2. Unlock purple_door_2, go to room_3.

3. Unlock blue_door_1.

4. Pick purple_ball_2.

5. Return to room_2 via room_4.

6. Then handle moving red_box_2.

But moving red_box_2 requires going to room_4 again. Also, the constraint to have red_box_2 in room_2 and holding purple_ball_2 at some state. So when holding purple_ball_2, we can be in room_2, and red_box_2 can be moved there earlier.

But this seems more steps.

Hmm, perhaps the initial plan is the optimal one.

But let's count the steps. The initial plan has 25 steps. Maybe there's redundancy. For example, after step 2 (pick blue_ball_1), dropping it immediately (step 3) may not be necessary if we can carry it. But later steps require picking up red_box_2, so we need to drop it before step 8. So perhaps steps 2 and 3 can be avoided by not picking blue_ball_1 early, but instead picking it up later.

Wait, constraint 2 says we must hold blue_ball_1 at some state. So we can do that at any point. For example, after returning to room_2 with purple_ball_2, drop it, then pick blue_ball_1 again. But that adds steps.

Alternatively, after step 25 (dropping purple_ball_2 in room_2), then pick blue_ball_1 again. But that's additional steps.

Hmm. Let's see if we can optimize by picking blue_ball_1 later.

Alternative plan:

Start in room_2.

1. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_4

2. toggle grey_door_1

3. gotoroom room_2 room_4 grey_door_1

4. gotoobject red_box_2 room_4

5. pick red_box_2 room_4

6. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_2

7. gotoroom room_4 room_2 grey_door_1 (now in room_2, holding red_box_2. Need to drop it here.)

8. drop red_box_2 room_2 (now red_box_2 is in room_2.)

Now, need to go to room_3.

9. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_4

10. gotoroom room_2 room_4 grey_door_1

11. gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_3

12. toggle purple_door_2

13. gotoroom room_4 room_3 purple_door_2

14. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_1

15. toggle blue_door_1

16. gotoobject purple_ball_2 room_3

17. pick purple_ball_2 room_3

18. gotodoor purple_door_2 room_3 room_4

19. gotoroom room_3 room_4 purple_door_2

20. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_2

21. gotoroom room_4 room_2 grey_door_1 (now in room_2, holding purple_ball_2 and blue_door_1 is unlocked. This satisfies constraint 8.)

22. drop purple_ball_2 room_2 (now in front of it, goal achieved.)

Now, need to pick blue_ball_1 at some point. Let's do that after dropping purple_ball_2:

23. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_2

24. pick blue_ball_1 room_2 (satisfies constraint 2.)

But this adds two more steps. Total steps: 24. But is this valid?

Check constraints:

- At some point, hold blue_ball_1 (step 24).

- At some point, grey_door_1 and blue_door_1 are unlocked (steps 2 and 15).

- At some point, in room_3 (steps 13-19).

- At some point, holding purple_ball_2 and red_box_2 in room_2: step 17 (holding purple_ball_2), step 8 (red_box_2 in room_2). So yes.

- If in room_2 at step 7, 8, 21, 22, 23, 24: after step 21, we are in room_2 holding purple_ball_2 and blue_door_1 is unlocked. So constraint 8 is satisfied.

This plan has 24 steps. But maybe even shorter.

Wait, after step 8 (red_box_2 in room_2), we can go to room_4, then room_3, unlock doors, pick purple_ball_2, return to room_2. Then after dropping, pick blue_ball_1.

But is there a way to reduce steps further?

Alternatively, when in room_3 after step 13, we can pick purple_ball_2 and then carry it back. Let's see:

In the alternative plan, steps 1-22 are required. Then steps 23-24 to pick blue_ball_1. Total 24 steps.

Original plan had 25 steps. So this is better. But maybe even shorter.

Another approach: When in room_2 initially, instead of immediately going to grey_door_1, first pick blue_ball_1 and drop it. Then proceed.

But that adds steps. Hmm.

Alternatively, after dropping red_box_2 in room_2 (step 8), go to room_4, then room_3, unlock blue_door_1 and get purple_ball_2. Then return to room_2. Then pick blue_ball_1. This would require:

9. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_4

10. gotoroom room_2 room_4 grey_door_1

11. gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_3

12. toggle purple_door_2

13. gotoroom room_4 room_3 purple_door_2

14. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_1

15. toggle blue_door_1

16. gotoobject purple_ball_2 room_3

17. pick purple_ball_2 room_3

18. gotodoor purple_door_2 room_3 room_4

19. gotoroom room_3 room_4 purple_door_2

20. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_2

21. gotoroom room_4 room_2 grey_door_1

22. drop purple_ball_2 room_2

23. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_2

24. pick blue_ball_1 room_2

So 24 steps. But in this case, after step 22, we're in front of purple_ball_2. The goal is satisfied. Then steps 23-24 are for picking blue_ball_1, which is required. So the plan ends at step 24.

But is the goal satisfied at step 22? Yes. But the problem requires the final state to have the goal. So steps 23-24 are unnecessary for the goal, but required for the constraint.

But since the problem says "bring about the goal of the problem while satisfying all constraints", the plan must end with the goal achieved, but all constraints must be met during the plan. So the blue_ball_1 can be picked up after achieving the goal, but the plan can continue beyond the goal as long as all constraints are met. However, since the plan must be optimal (shortest possible), we need to see if we can merge steps.

Wait, after step 22 (dropping purple_ball_2), the goal is achieved. But we still need to pick blue_ball_1 to satisfy constraint 2. So the plan must include that step. So the optimal plan would be the minimal steps that achieve the goal and all constraints.

But in this case, the plan must include picking blue_ball_1 at some point. So perhaps the initial approach where we pick blue_ball_1 early is better.

Alternatively, can we pick blue_ball_1 after dropping purple_ball_2? Like:

After step 22 (drop purple_ball_2), which achieves the goal, then:

23. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_2

24. pick blue_ball_1 room_2

25. drop blue_ball_1 room_2 (if needed, but not necessary as long as we pick it up once.)

But step 24 would satisfy constraint 2. So the plan ends at step 24.

But in this case, the steps are:

1. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_4

2. toggle grey_door_1

3. gotoroom room_2 room_4 grey_door_1

4. gotoobject red_box_2 room_4

5. pick red_box_2 room_4

6. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_2

7. gotoroom room_4 room_2 grey_door_1

8. drop red_box_2 room_2

9. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_4

10. gotoroom room_2 room_4 grey_door_1

11. gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_3

12. toggle purple_door_2

13. gotoroom room_4 room_3 purple_door_2

14. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_1

15. toggle blue_door_1

16. gotoobject purple_ball_2 room_3

17. pick purple_ball_2 room_3

18. gotodoor purple_door_2 room_3 room_4

19. gotoroom room_3 room_4 purple_door_2

20. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_2

21. gotoroom room_4 room_2 grey_door_1

22. drop purple_ball_2 room_2

23. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_2

24. pick blue_ball_1 room_2

That's 24 steps. Now, does this plan satisfy all constraints?

Yes:

- Constraint 2: step 24.

- Constraint 3: steps 2 (grey_door_1 unlocked), step 15 (blue_door_1 unlocked). So at step 15, both are unlocked, but they might not be in the same state. However, the constraint requires that "The following conditions are all true: grey_door_1 is not locked, blue_door_1 is not locked" at least once. So there must be a state where both are unlocked. But in this plan, after step 15, blue_door_1 is unlocked, and grey_door_1 was unlocked in step 2. However, grey_door_1 remains unlocked unless toggled again. Since the plan doesn't toggle it again, grey_door_1 stays unlocked. So after step 15, both are unlocked. Therefore, the state after step 15 satisfies that condition.

- Constraint 6: step 17 (holding purple_ball_2) and step 8 (red_box_2 in room_2). So any state after step 8 and during step 17 onward would satisfy this. For example, step 17 is in room_3, but red_box_2 is in room_2. So the constraint is satisfied.

- Constraint 8: when in room_2 (steps 7,8,21,22,23,24). In step 21, the agent enters room_2 holding purple_ball_2, and blue_door_1 was unlocked in step 15. So constraint 8 is satisfied here.

This plan seems to satisfy all constraints and has 24 steps. Is there a way to make it shorter?

For example, after step 8 (dropping red_box_2 in room_2), can we immediately go to room_3 via room_4 and unlock doors, then return. Let's see:

After step 8:

9. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_4

10. gotoroom room_2 room_4 grey_door_1

11. gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_3

12. toggle purple_door_2

13. gotoroom room_4 room_3 purple_door_2

14. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_1

15. toggle blue_door_1

16. gotoobject purple_ball_2 room_3

17. pick purple_ball_2 room_3

18. gotodoor purple_door_2 room_3 room_4

19. gotoroom room_3 room_4 purple_door_2

20. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_2

21. gotoroom room_4 room_2 grey_door_1

22. drop purple_ball_2 room_2

23. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_2

24. pick blue_ball_1 room_2

This is 24 steps. Can any steps be merged or removed?

For instance, after step 21 (back in room_2), can we drop purple_ball_2 and pick blue_ball_1 in fewer steps?

But dropping requires being in front of an empty position. So after dropping, we are in front of purple_ball_2. To pick blue_ball_1, we need to gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_2, which requires being in the same room. So steps would be:

21. gotoroom ... (now in room_2, holding purple_ball_2)

22. drop purple_ball_2 room_2 (now in front of it)

23. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_2 (move to blue_ball_1)

24. pick blue_ball_1 room_2

But step 23 requires that the agent is in room_2, which they are. So these steps are necessary.

Alternatively, can we drop purple_ball_2 and pick blue_ball_1 without the extra goto?

No, because after dropping, you are in front of purple_ball_2. To pick blue_ball_1, you need to be in front of it, which requires gotoobject.

So steps 22-24 are necessary.

Another possible optimization: when returning to room_2 (step 21), can we drop purple_ball_2 and pick blue_ball_1 in one action? No, because each action is separate.

Thus, the plan is 24 steps. Is there a shorter plan?

Wait, when we first go to room_4 to get red_box_2, we could also unlock purple_door_2 at the same time. Let's see:

After step 3 (in room_4):

4. gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_3

5. toggle purple_door_2

6. gotoobject red_box_2 room_4

7. pick red_box_2 room_4

8. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_2

9. gotoroom room_4 room_2 grey_door_1

10. drop red_box_2 room_2

Then go back to room_4, but purple_door_2 is already unlocked. So this saves steps.

Let me adjust the plan:

1. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_4

2. toggle grey_door_1

3. gotoroom room_2 room_4 grey_door_1

4. gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_3

5. toggle purple_door_2

6. gotoobject red_box_2 room_4

7. pick red_box_2 room_4

8. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_2

9. gotoroom room_4 room_2 grey_door_1

10. drop red_box_2 room_2

11. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_4

12. gotoroom room_2 room_4 grey_door_1

13. gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_3

14. gotoroom room_4 room_3 purple_door_2

15. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_1

16. toggle blue_door_1

17. gotoobject purple_ball_2 room_3

18. pick purple_ball_2 room_3

19. gotodoor purple_door_2 room_3 room_4

20. gotoroom room_3 room_4 purple_door_2

21. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_2

22. gotoroom room_4 room_2 grey_door_1

23. drop purple_ball_2 room_2

24. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_2

25. pick blue_ball_1 room_2

Wait, but this is 25 steps again. By unlocking purple_door_2 earlier (step 5), we saved a step later. But steps increase again. Not helpful.

Alternative idea: After step 5 (unlock purple_door_2), proceed to room_3 directly, unlock blue_door_1, get purple_ball_2, then come back to room_4, then to room_2. But then moving red_box_2 comes later. But how?

Let me try:

1. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_4

2. toggle grey_door_1

3. gotoroom room_2 room_4 grey_door_1

4. gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_3

5. toggle purple_door_2

6. gotoroom room_4 room_3 purple_door_2

7. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_1

8. toggle blue_door_1

9. gotoobject purple_ball_2 room_3

10. pick purple_ball_2 room_3

11. gotodoor purple_door_2 room_3 room_4

12. gotoroom room_3 room_4 purple_door_2

13. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_2

14. gotoroom room_4 room_2 grey_door_1

15. drop purple_ball_2 room_2

16. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_2

17. pick blue_ball_1 room_2

18. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_4

19. gotoroom room_2 room_4 grey_door_1

20. gotoobject red_box_2 room_4

21. pick red_box_2 room_4

22. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_2

23. gotoroom room_4 room_2 grey_door_1

24. drop red_box_2 room_2

But now, red_box_2 is moved to room_2 in step 24, but we need to have held purple_ball_2 and red_box_2 in room_2. In this plan, after step 15, purple_ball_2 is in room_2, and red_box_2 is moved in step 24. So the state after step 24 has red_box_2 in room_2, but purple_ball_2 was already dropped there in step 15. So the constraint requires that at some state, you are holding purple_ball_2 and red_box_2 is in room_2. In step 10-14, you are holding purple_ball_2, but red_box_2 is still in room_4. After step 24, red_box_2 is in room_2, but you are not holding purple_ball_2. So this approach doesn't satisfy constraint 6.

Thus, the previous plan where red_box_2 is moved to room_2 first is necessary.

After several iterations, the optimal plan seems to be 24 steps. But I need to check if there's a shorter path.

Another angle: Can we toggle blue_door_1 and grey_door_1 in a way that their unlocked states overlap?

For example, in the initial plan, after unlocking grey_door_1 (step 5) and blue_door_1 (step 18), both remain unlocked. So after step 18, both are unlocked. So the state after step 18 satisfies constraint 3 (both doors unlocked).

But in the plan, after step 18, the agent is in room_3. So the state after step 18: grey_door_1 is unlocked, blue_door_1 is unlocked. That satisfies constraint 3.

Thus, that state meets constraint 3. So no need to do anything else.

But in the initial plan, after step 18, the agent is in room_3, so that's acceptable.

Thus, the initial plan of 24 steps is valid.

But let's confirm:

- Constraint 3: "The following conditions are all true: grey_door_1 is not locked, blue_door_1 is not locked". This is true after step 18, as both are unlocked.

- Constraint 6: "you are holding purple_ball_2 and red_box_2 is in room_2". After step 17 (holding purple_ball_2), red_box_2 was moved to room_2 in step 8. So any state after step 8 and during step 17-22 would satisfy this.

- Constraint 8: when in room_2 at step 9, 10, 22, 23, 24. In step 22, when entering room_2, holding purple_ball_2 and blue_door_1 is unlocked. So satisfies.

Thus, this plan meets all constraints and the goal.

But now, the step count is 24. Is there a way to do it in fewer steps?

What if after picking purple_ball_2 in room_3, we go back to room_2 via room_4 and grey_door_1, drop it, then pick blue_ball_1. That's what the plan does.

Another idea: Instead of picking blue_ball_1 in the beginning, pick it later. For example, after dropping purple_ball_2 in room_2, then goto and pick blue_ball_1. This way, we avoid the initial pick and drop of blue_ball_1.

Let's see:

Revised plan:

1. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_4

2. toggle grey_door_1

3. gotoroom room_2 room_4 grey_door_1

4. gotoobject red_box_2 room_4

5. pick red_box_2 room_4

6. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_2

7. gotoroom room_4 room_2 grey_door_1

8. drop red_box_2 room_2

9. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_4

10. gotoroom room_2 room_4 grey_door_1

11. gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_3

12. toggle purple_door_2

13. gotoroom room_4 room_3 purple_door_2

14. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_1

15. toggle blue_door_1

16. gotoobject purple_ball_2 room_3

17. pick purple_ball_2 room_3

18. gotodoor purple_door_2 room_3 room_4

19. gotoroom room_3 room_4 purple_door_2

20. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_2

21. gotoroom room_4 room_2 grey_door_1

22. drop purple_ball_2 room_2

23. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_2

24. pick blue_ball_1 room_2

This is 24 steps. By not picking blue_ball_1 early, we save steps 1-3 from the initial approach. Now, this plan has 24 steps, and satisfies all constraints.

Yes, in this plan:

- blue_ball_1 is picked at step 24.

- grey_door_1 and blue_door_1 are both unlocked after step 15.

- purple_ball_2 is held and red_box_2 is in room_2 after step 17.

- all other constraints are met.

This seems to be the optimal plan. But the problem requires the optimal plan, i.e., the shortest possible. Can this be done in fewer steps?

Let me think: after dropping purple_ball_2 in room_2 (step 22), the goal is achieved. But the constraint requires holding blue_ball_1 at some point. So steps 23-24 are necessary. Can we merge these steps?

No, because each action is separate. So this is necessary.

Is there a way to avoid moving red_box_2? Because moving red_box_2 requires several steps. But the constraint requires that red_box_2 is in room_2 at some point when holding purple_ball_2. So it's mandatory.

Thus, this plan seems to be the shortest possible.
