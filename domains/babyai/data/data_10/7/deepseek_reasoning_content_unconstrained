Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. So the goal is to have a purple ball that I'm in front of. The initial state has me in room_2, and there are various objects in different rooms. The doors are all locked initially, which might be a problem. Let's see where the purple balls are.

Looking at the initial state: purple_ball_1 is in room_1, and purple_ball_2 is in room_3. So I need to get to one of those. But I'm starting in room_2. Let's check the doors. The doors connecting room_2 to room_1 is purple_door_1, and room_2 to room_4 is grey_door_1. Both are locked. So first, I need to unlock those doors to move between rooms.

Wait, the problem is to be in front of a purple ball. Let's see. The closest purple balls are in room_1 and room_3. From room_2, I can reach room_1 via purple_door_1, but it's locked. To unlock it, I need to toggle it. But to toggle a door, I need to be in front of it. So the steps would be: go to the door, toggle it, then go through the door to the next room.

But first, I'm in room_2. Let's see. The doors connected to room_2 are purple_door_1 (to room_1) and grey_door_1 (to room_4). Both are locked. So if I can get to one of those doors, toggle them, then go through.

But how do I get to the door? The goto door action requires that I'm in a room connected by that door, and that there's no object blocking the position in front of the door. Wait, the initial state doesn't mention any objects blocking doors. Let me check the initial objects. In room_2, there's blue_ball_1 and blue_ball_2. Are they blocking the doors? The problem statement says that "the position in front of d in the room you are currently in" must not be blocked. But the initial state doesn't mention any objects being in front of doors. So maybe the doors aren't blocked. So I can go to the door.

So step by step:

1. From room_2, go to purple_door_1 (which connects room_2 to room_1). The precondition for gotodoor is that I'm in a room connected by the door (yes, room_2 is connected via purple_door_1 to room_1) and no object is blocking the position. Since the initial state doesn't mention any objects blocking doors, I assume this is okay.

So action: gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1.

Then, toggle the door to unlock it. Since it's locked, toggling it will unlock it. Action: toggle purple_door_1.

Now the door is unlocked. Then, I can go to room_1 via gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1.

Once in room_1, I need to go to the purple_ball_1. So action: gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_1.

Then pick it up. Wait, but the goal is to be in front of a purple ball, not necessarily to pick it up. But the goal is "there is a ball v such that v is purple and you are in front of v". So just being in front of it is sufficient. So maybe after entering room_1, I can just go to the purple_ball_1 and that's it.

Wait, but the initial state says the agent is in room_2. So steps:

1. Go to purple_door_1 from room_2: gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1.

2. Toggle purple_door_1 to unlock it.

3. Gotoroom from room_2 to room_1 via purple_door_1.

4. Now in room_1, go to purple_ball_1: gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_1.

That would make me in front of a purple ball, satisfying the goal.

But wait, after step 3, when you enter room_1, you are no longer in front of any door or object. So you have to go to the object. So steps 1-4 would work.

But let's check if that's possible. Let's verify each action's preconditions.

First action: gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1. Preconditions: I'm in a room connected by the door (room_2 is connected to room_1 via purple_door_1) and no object is blocking the position. Since there's no mention of objects in front of the door in room_2, this is allowed. So this action is valid.

Then toggle purple_door_1. Precondition: must be in front of the door. After gotodoor, I am in front of purple_door_1. So toggle is allowed.

Then gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1. Preconditions: current room is room_2 (which I am in after the first two actions?), wait, wait. Wait, after the gotodoor action, the agent is in front of the door, but still in room_2. The gotoroom action moves from room_2 to room_1, using door purple_door_1, which is now unlocked. So yes, that's allowed. After that, the agent is in room_1.

Then, in room_1, the agent can perform gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_1. Since they are in room_1, this is allowed. Then the effect is that they are in front of purple_ball_1, which satisfies the goal.

So the plan would be:

gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1

toggle purple_door_1

gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1

gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_1

That's four actions. Is there a shorter path? Let's see.

Alternatively, maybe there's another door to unlock that allows access to a different purple ball. For example, the purple_ball_2 is in room_3. To get to room_3 from room_2, I could go through room_1 via blue_door_1, but that's locked. Or go through room_4 via grey_door_1 and then to room_4, then to room_3 via purple_door_2.

Let's see. Let's compare both options.

Option 1: Go to room_1 via purple_door_1 (unlock, go through) then gotoobject purple_ball_1. Four steps as above.

Option 2: Go to room_4 via grey_door_1. Let's see:

To get to room_4 from room_2, need to unlock grey_door_1.

So steps:

gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_4

toggle grey_door_1

gotoroom room_2 room_4 grey_door_1

Now in room_4. Then, from room_4, need to go to room_3 via purple_door_2, which is locked. So need to go to that door, unlock it, then go through.

So:

gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_3

toggle purple_door_2

gotoroom room_4 room_3 purple_door_2

Now in room_3. Then gotoobject purple_ball_2 room_3.

That's 6 actions, which is longer than option 1. So option 1 is better.

Alternatively, from room_2, can I go to room_3 via some other path? Let's see. room_2 is connected to room_4 via grey_door_1, and room_1 via purple_door_1. To get to room_3, perhaps via room_1 and then blue_door_1. But blue_door_1 is locked. So:

From room_2 to room_1 (unlock purple_door_1, go in). Then in room_1, go to blue_door_1 (connecting to room_3). That door is locked. So need to unlock it.

So steps:

1. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1

2. toggle purple_door_1

3. gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1

4. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_3

5. toggle blue_door_1

6. gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_1

7. gotoobject purple_ball_2 room_3

That's 7 steps, which is even longer. So definitely the first option is better.

Therefore, the optimal plan is the first one: four steps.

Wait, but wait, after step 3 (gotoroom to room_1), the agent is in room_1. Then, they need to gotoobject purple_ball_1 in room_1. The preconditions for gotoobject are that they are in the same room as the object. Since purple_ball_1 is in room_1, yes. So that's allowed.

So the plan is:

gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1

toggle purple_door_1

gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1

gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_1

But let me check if the agent can perform these actions in sequence.

After the first action (gotodoor), the agent is in front of purple_door_1 in room_2. Then toggle the door, which unlocks it. Then gotoroom from room_2 to room_1. Then in room_1, the agent is not in front of any object or door. Then gotoobject purple_ball_1 in room_1, which is allowed.

Yes. So this plan works and is four steps. Is there any way to make it shorter?

Wait, maybe there's a way to pick up the ball and drop it in front of me, but the goal is just to be in front of a purple ball. Since the purple_ball_1 is already in room_1, just going there and being in front of it suffices. So no need to pick or drop.

Therefore, the four-step plan is valid and optimal, as any other path would require more steps.
