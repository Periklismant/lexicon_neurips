Okay, let's see. I need to figure out a plan to get the agent to room_1, in front of a red ball that's already in room_1. The initial state says the red_ball_1 is in room_1. So the goal is to be in room_1, in front of red_ball_1. 

First, the agent starts in room_3. To get to room_1, the doors between rooms are all locked initially. So the agent needs to unlock doors to move. Let's check the connections. Rooms are connected as follows:

- room_1 and room_2 via green_door_1 (locked)
- room_1 and room_3 via yellow_door_1 (locked)
- room_2 and room_4 via grey_door_1 (locked)
- room_3 and room_4 via green_door_2 (locked)

Since the agent is in room_3, the possible doors are yellow_door_1 (connecting to room_1) and green_door_2 (connecting to room_4). But all doors are locked. So the agent needs to unlock a door to move.

Wait, to unlock a door, the agent must be in front of it. To get in front of a door, they need to be in a room connected by that door. For example, to get to yellow_door_1 from room_3, the agent is in room_3, which is connected to room_1 via yellow_door_1. But wait, the connections are room_3 and room_1 via yellow_door_1. So the agent can go to the door if there's no object blocking it. Are there any objects blocking doors?

In the initial state, the objects in room_3 are purple_box_1, grey_ball_2, and purple_ball_1. The doors in room_3 would be yellow_door_1 (to room_1) and green_door_2 (to room_4). Are any of these doors blocked by objects? The precondition for gotodoor is that there's no object blocking the position in front of the door in the current room. So, if there's an object in front of the door in room_3, then the agent can't go to the door. But how do we know if objects are blocking doors?

The initial state doesn't mention any objects blocking doors. The problem description says that objects may block doors, but the initial state doesn't state that. So maybe none of the doors are blocked. So the agent can go to the door in their current room (room_3), which is yellow_door_1 (connecting to room_1) and green_door_2 (connecting to room_4). 

But to toggle (unlock) a door, the agent needs to be in front of it. So first, the agent needs to go to yellow_door_1 in room_3. Let's try that.

So steps could be:

1. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1
2. toggle yellow_door_1 (unlocks it)
3. gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_1 (move to room_1)
4. Then, in room_1, go to red_ball_1 and be in front of it.

But wait, after moving to room_1, the agent is there. Then, they need to go to the red_ball_1. So the steps would be:

- After entering room_1, perform gotoobject red_ball_1 room_1.

But the preconditions for gotoobject are that the agent is in the same room as the object, which they would be after moving to room_1. Then pick up? Wait, no. The goal is to be in front of the ball, not holding it. So just gotoobject red_ball_1 room_1.

But the problem is: when the agent moves to room_1 via the door, they are no longer in front of any object. So after gotoroom, they are in room_1 but not in front of anything. Then they need to go to the red_ball_1.

So the plan would be:

1. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1 (agent is now in front of the door)
2. toggle yellow_door_1 (unlocks it)
3. gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_1 (agent moves to room_1)
4. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_1 (now in front of it)

But wait, step 1: gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1. The gotodoor action's preconditions require that the agent is in a room connected by the door. Since the agent is in room_3, and yellow_door_1 connects room_3 and room_1, that's correct. Also, there's no object blocking the position in front of the door in room_3. Assuming that's the case, then gotodoor is possible.

After toggling, the door becomes unlocked. Then gotoroom from room_3 to room_1 via yellow_door_1 is possible.

Once in room_1, the agent can gotoobject red_ball_1.

But wait, the initial state has the agent in room_3. Let's verify the initial state:

Original state: you are in room_3. The doors are all locked. So the steps above make sense.

But let's check for any constraints. The user mentioned constraints, but the problem statement says "A valid plan for the abovementioned problem must abide by the following constraints:" but the constraints section is empty. So maybe there are no additional constraints beyond the action preconditions. So the plan above is possible.

But wait, the initial state says that all doors are locked. So step 1: gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1. Preconditions: agent is in a room connected by the door (yes, room_3), and no object is blocking the door's position in the current room. Since room_3 has objects, but the problem doesn't state that any are blocking doors, so this is allowed.

Then step 2: toggle yellow_door_1. Since the agent is in front of it, this unlocks the door.

Step 3: gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_1. Now, the door is unlocked, so this is allowed.

Upon entering room_1, the agent is no longer in front of anything. Then, step 4: gotoobject red_ball_1 room_1. Since the agent is in room_1 and the ball is there, this is allowed.

But wait, after moving to room_1, the agent is in the room, but not in front of any object. So they need to perform the gotoobject action to get in front of the red_ball_1.

So the plan is four steps. But is there a shorter path?

Alternatively, is there a way to unlock the door while already in front of it, then move through, and then go to the ball. That's exactly what's happening here. So this seems optimal. Let me check for any possible shorter path.

But the doors are all locked. The agent must unlock at least one door to get from room_3 to room_1. The yellow_door_1 is the direct connection. So the steps are necessary: go to door, unlock, move through, then go to ball.

Alternatively, maybe another path through other rooms, but that would require more steps. For example, going to room_4 via green_door_2, but that's also locked, so needing to unlock that door as well. Which would be longer.

So the shortest path is the direct one through yellow_door_1.

Therefore, the optimal plan should be:

gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1

toggle yellow_door_1

gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_1

gotoobject red_ball_1 room_1

But let's check if all preconditions are met for each action.

First action: gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1. The agent is in room_3, which is connected via yellow_door_1 to room_1. So precondition (i) is met. Precondition (ii): no object blocking the door's position in room_3. Since the initial state in room_3 has purple_box_1, grey_ball_2, purple_ball_1. Are any of these blocking the door? The problem statement doesn't mention objects blocking doors, so unless stated otherwise, the doors are not blocked. So the agent can go to the door.

Second action: toggle yellow_door_1. Agent is in front of it, so allowed.

Third action: gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_1. The door is now unlocked. So allowed.

Fourth action: gotoobject red_ball_1 room_1. Agent is in room_1, red_ball_1 is in room_1. So allowed.

Yes, that seems to work. So this is a valid 4-step plan. And since unlocking and moving through the door is necessary, this is the minimal steps.
