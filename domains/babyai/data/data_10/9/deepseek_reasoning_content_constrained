Okay, let's tackle this planning problem step by step. First, I need to understand the initial state, the goal, and the constraints. 

The initial state says the agent is in room_3. The goal is to have a red ball (v) in room_1, the agent in room_1, and in front of that red ball. The red_ball_1 is already in room_1, so maybe the agent just needs to get there and be in front of it. But there are constraints to satisfy along the way.

Constraints to consider:
1. At least once, grey_door_1 must be unlocked.
2. Yellow_door_1 must always be locked. So we can't unlock it at any point.
3. The agent must be in room_1 at least once.
4. If the agent is in room_1 in some state, there must be an earlier state where they were holding an object.
5. Must be in room_3 at least once. But the agent starts there, so that's covered unless they leave and need to return. Wait, the initial state says they've visited room_3. But the constraint is that in at least one state, they are in room_3. Since they start there, maybe that's already satisfied. But if they leave, they might need to come back. Hmm, but the initial "you have visited room_3" is part of the state. The constraint is about being in room_3 in some state, which is already true. So maybe that's already satisfied. Wait, the problem says "the following expression must hold in at least one state: you are in room_3". Since the initial state is part of the plan, that's already covered. So no action needed for that.

Other constraints:
6. If the agent is in room_3 in any state s, then they must be holding an object at s or after. So if the agent is in room_3 again after leaving, they need to be holding something then or later. Since they start in room_3, but not holding anything, but the initial state is okay as long as in any subsequent state where they are in room_3, they either hold something then or later. Wait, the constraint says "If you are in room_3 holds in some state s, then you must be holding an object at s or after." So the initial state is s0 where they are in room_3 but not holding anything. That would violate the constraint unless the agent picks up something later. So they need to, after being in room_3 (like maybe when they come back?), make sure they are holding something. Wait, but the initial state is part of the plan. So the constraint applies to all states in the plan. So the initial state has the agent in room_3 and not holding anything. That violates the constraint because if the agent is in room_3 in state s (the initial state), then in s or a subsequent state, they must be holding an object. So the agent must pick up an object in room_3 before leaving. Because if they leave room_3 without picking up anything, then the initial state (s0) violates the constraint. Because in s0, they are in room_3 but not holding anything, and there's no later state where they are holding something if they leave and never pick up. Wait, but the plan starts in room_3. So the initial state is s0. The constraint says, for any state s where they are in room_3, they must be holding an object at s or some state after s. So s0 is in room_3, so in s0 or later, they must hold something. Since in s0 they are not holding anything, they must hold something in some later state. So if they pick up something later, even if they are no longer in room_3, that's okay. Wait, no. Because the constraint is: if in state s you are in room_3, then in s or any state after s, you must hold an object. So if the agent is in room_3 again later, say after leaving and coming back, then at that time or after, they must hold an object. But the initial state is s0: in room_3, not holding anything. So to satisfy the constraint, there must be a state after s0 where they hold an object. Because in s0, they are in room_3 and not holding, so the constraint requires that at s0 or later, they hold something. Since s0 is not holding, they must hold in some state after s0. So the agent must pick up an object at some point in the plan. But perhaps when they are in room_3 again? Wait, the agent starts in room_3. Suppose they leave room_3, go to room_1 via yellow_door_1, but that's locked. Wait, initial state says yellow_door_1 is locked, and the constraint says it must always be locked. So they can't use yellow_door_1. So they have to go through other doors. Let's see the connections:

Rooms are connected as follows:
- room_1 and room_2 via green_door_1 (locked initially)
- room_1 and room_3 via yellow_door_1 (locked, must remain locked)
- room_2 and room_4 via grey_door_1 (locked)
- room_3 and room_4 via green_door_2 (locked)

So all doors are locked. The agent is in room_3. To get to room_4, they need to go through green_door_2, which is locked. So they need to unlock it. But the toggle action requires being in front of the door. To get in front of green_door_2 in room_3, they need to goto the door. But to go to the door, there must be no object blocking it. Are any objects blocking doors? Let's check the initial positions. In room_3: purple_box_1, grey_ball_2, purple_ball_1. Do any of these block the door? The 'blocking' is mentioned in the preconditions for gotodoor: you can only go to a door if there's no object blocking the position in front of d in the current room. So the position in front of the door in the current room must be clear. So for green_door_2 in room_3, is there an object blocking it? The initial state in room_3 has objects purple_box_1, grey_ball_2, purple_ball_1. But we don't know their exact positions. The problem description doesn't state that any objects are blocking doors. So perhaps by default, doors are not blocked. So the agent can go to the door.

So from room_3, the agent can go to green_door_2, toggle (unlock) it, then go through to room_4. Then from room_4, perhaps use grey_door_1 to get to room_2, but that's locked. Need to unlock it. But unlocking doors requires being in front of them. So agent would need to go to grey_door_1 in room_4, toggle it, then go to room_2. Then from room_2, maybe use green_door_1 to get to room_1, but green_door_1 is locked. Need to unlock that as well. But wait, the constraints require that grey_door_1 must be unlocked at least once. So if the agent unlocks grey_door_1, that satisfies that constraint.

But the goal is to be in room_1 in front of red_ball_1. So how to get there. Let's outline possible steps:

1. From room_3, go to green_door_2 (room_3 and room_4), unlock it (toggle), then go to room_4.

But to unlock green_door_2, the agent needs to be in front of it. So:

Action: gotodoor green_door_2 room_3 room_4
Precondition: in a room connected by the door (room_3), and no object blocking. Assuming possible.

Then toggle green_door_2. Now it's unlocked. Then goto room_4 via green_door_2.

Then in room_4, the agent can go to grey_door_1 (connecting room_4 and room_2). Unlock it (toggle), which satisfies the constraint that grey_door_1 is not locked at least once. Then go to room_2 via grey_door_1.

From room_2, need to get to room_1. The door connecting room_1 and room_2 is green_door_1, which is locked. So need to unlock it. But to unlock green_door_1, the agent must be in front of it. So go to green_door_1 in room_2, toggle it (unlock), then go to room_1.

Once in room_1, the agent can gotoobject red_ball_1 room_1, then drop any object they might be holding? Wait, but the goal requires the agent to be in front of the red ball in room_1. So perhaps they just need to go there. But the agent starts in room_3. Let's see.

But wait, the constraints:

- The agent must be in room_1 at least once. So arriving there is part of the plan.

- Also, if the agent is in room_1 in some state, there must be an earlier state where they were holding an object. So before entering room_1, the agent must have held something.

So perhaps the agent needs to pick up an object in room_3 (since they start there), then carry it through. But in room_3, there's purple_box_1, grey_ball_2, purple_ball_1. So maybe pick up one of them. But when they pick up an object, they need to be in front of it. So first, gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_3, then pick it up.

But when they pick up the object, they are no longer in front of it, and the object is no longer in the room. So after picking up, the agent can carry the object.

But the agent needs to drop it somewhere? Or maybe hold it until they reach room_1. But the goal doesn't require the agent to be holding anything. So perhaps the agent can pick up an object in room_3, carry it through to room_1, and then drop it there. But the constraint that if the agent is in room_1, there must be an earlier state where they held an object is satisfied by holding the object before entering room_1.

Wait, the constraint says: if the agent is in room_1 in some state, then there must be an earlier state where they held an object. So even if they drop the object before entering room_1, as long as they held it earlier, that's okay. But if they are in room_1, they must have held an object before that state.

So possible steps:

1. In room_3, gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_3
2. pick purple_ball_1 room_3 → now holding it
3. Then proceed to unlock doors and move towards room_1, carrying the ball. Then when in room_1, they can drop it (but the goal requires being in front of red_ball_1, which is already there). So maybe they don't need to drop, but just have to be in room_1 in front of red_ball_1.

But let's see:

The goal is that there exists a ball v (which is red, in room_1, agent in room_1, and in front of v). The red_ball_1 is already in room_1, so the agent just needs to get there and be in front of it.

So the steps would involve moving from room_3 to room_4, then to room_2, then to room_1, then gotoobject red_ball_1 room_1.

But the constraints require that during the plan:

- At least once, the agent is in front of green_door_2. So when they goto green_door_2 in room_3, that's covered.

- At least once, in front of yellow_door_1. So maybe the agent has to go to yellow_door_1 in room_3. But since yellow_door_1 is locked and must remain locked, they can't go through it. But the constraint is just to be in front of it. So they can goto yellow_door_1 in room_3, but can't go through it. But when they go in front of it, the constraint that if in front of yellow_door_1 in state s, then they must be holding blue_box_1 at s or after. But blue_box_1 is in room_4. So the agent can't be holding blue_box_1 when in front of yellow_door_1 unless they first go to room_4, pick it up, then return to room_3. But how? Because to get back to room_3 from room_4, they have to go through green_door_2 again. But maybe that's possible.

Wait, this is a complication. The agent needs to be in front of yellow_door_1 (which connects room_1 and room_3). But the agent starts in room_3, so to be in front of yellow_door_1, they can do gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1. But then, according to the constraint, when they are in front of yellow_door_1, they must be holding blue_box_1 at that state or later. But blue_box_1 is in room_4. So the agent would need to go to room_4, get the blue_box_1, bring it back to room_3, then go to yellow_door_1. But that's a lot of steps.

Alternatively, maybe the agent can first go to room_4, get blue_box_1, then return to room_3, go to yellow_door_1, which satisfies the constraint, then proceed. But that adds steps. Let's see.

So possible plan outline:

1. From room_3, go to green_door_2 (gotodoor green_door_2 room_3 room_4)
2. toggle green_door_2 to unlock
3. gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_2 → now in room_4
4. In room_4, pick up blue_box_1: gotoobject blue_box_1 room_4, then pick it
5. Now holding blue_box_1, need to go back to room_3 via green_door_2 (but door is unlocked)
6. gotodoor green_door_2 room_4 room_3 (but wait, the gotodoor action is in the current room. So in room_4, green_door_2 connects to room_3. So agent can goto green_door_2 in room_4.
7. gotodoor green_door_2 room_4 room_3
8. toggle green_door_2 again to lock it? No, because the constraint only requires grey_door_1 to be unlocked at least once. But green_door_2 can be unlocked. Wait, no constraints on green_door_2's state except yellow_door_1 must stay locked.

But the agent needs to go back to room_3. So from room_4, gotodoor green_door_2 room_4 room_3, then gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_2. Now back in room_3, holding blue_box_1.

Now, in room_3, need to go to yellow_door_1. So:

9. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1 → now in front of yellow_door_1. At this state, the agent is holding blue_box_1, so the constraint is satisfied (if they are in front of yellow_door_1, they must hold blue_box_1 now or later. Since they are holding it now, it's okay.)

Then proceed to other steps. But the agent needs to get to room_1. Since yellow_door_1 is locked and must remain locked, they can't use it. So they have to take another route. So after being in front of yellow_door_1, the agent can proceed to go to room_1 via other doors.

Wait, but the agent is in room_3 again. So from room_3, they can go back to room_4 via green_door_2, then to room_2 via grey_door_1, then to room_1 via green_door_1.

But this seems convoluted. Let's outline steps again:

1. In room_3, pick up purple_ball_1 (to satisfy the constraint that when in room_3, they hold something now or later). But wait, the initial state is in room_3. So in the first step, the agent is in room_3, not holding anything. So to satisfy the constraint, they must pick up something in room_3 before leaving. Because once they leave room_3, if they come back later, they need to hold something then. But the initial state is already in room_3, so the agent must pick up something in room_3 to satisfy the constraint.

Wait, the constraint says: if in any state s the agent is in room_3, then in s or a subsequent state, they must hold an object. So in the initial state (s0), they are in room_3 and not holding anything. So they must hold something in some state after s0. So the agent must pick up an object at some point in the plan. But not necessarily while in room_3 again. Wait, no. Because the constraint is that for any state s where the agent is in room_3, the holding condition applies. So s0 is a state where they are in room_3, and they are not holding. So they need to hold something in s0 or later. Since they can't hold in s0, they must hold something later. Even if they leave room_3 and never come back, they still have to hold something after s0. But the plan's goal requires them to be in room_1, so they will leave room_3. So in that case, the agent just needs to pick up any object at some point in the plan. But the other constraints may require picking up specific objects.

Alternatively, maybe the agent must pick up an object in room_3 before leaving. Because if they don't, and they leave room_3, then s0 (initial state) is in room_3 and not holding, and the constraint requires that in s0 or after, they hold something. So the agent must pick up something at least once in the plan.

But the constraint about room_3 says that if the agent is in room_3 in any state, they must hold an object then or after. So if the agent leaves room_3 and never returns, then the only state where they are in room_3 is s0. So they must hold an object at some point after s0, regardless of the room. So as long as they pick up any object later, that's okay. So perhaps they can pick up an object in room_4, for example. But then, the constraint about room_3 is satisfied because the agent was in room_3 (s0), and later holds an object (even if not in room_3). So that's acceptable.

But let's check again: the constraint is "If you are in room_3 in some state s, then you must be holding some object at s or at some state after s". So for s0 (room_3, not holding), they need to hold something after s0. So the agent must pick up an object at some point in the plan. Which they need to do anyway to satisfy the room_1 constraint (since to enter room_1, they must have held an object before).

So the agent can pick up an object anywhere, as long as they do it once. However, the constraint regarding yellow_door_1 says that when in front of it, they must be holding blue_box_1 then or after. So the agent needs to handle that.

Let's try to plan:

Agent starts in room_3.

1. gotodoor green_door_2 room_3 room_4
2. toggle green_door_2 (unlocks it)
3. gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_2 → now in room_4
4. In room_4, gotoobject blue_box_1 room_4
5. pick blue_box_1 room_4 → now holding blue_box_1
6. gotodoor green_door_2 room_4 room_3
7. toggle green_door_2 (lock it again? Not necessary unless required. But the constraints don't care about green_door_2's state except that grey_door_1 must be unlocked once.)
8. gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_2 → back to room_3, holding blue_box_1
9. Now in room_3, need to go to yellow_door_1 to satisfy the constraint of being in front of it.
10. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1 → now in front of yellow_door_1, holding blue_box_1. This satisfies the constraint that when in front of yellow_door_1, they are holding blue_box_1 (current state meets it)
11. Now, need to proceed to room_1. But yellow_door_1 is locked and must remain locked. So can't use it. So need another path.

From room_3, the agent can go back to room_4 via green_door_2 (unlocked), then go to room_2 via grey_door_1 (which is locked). So need to unlock grey_door_1.

12. gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_2
13. In room_4, gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_2
14. toggle grey_door_1 → unlocks it (satisfies the constraint that grey_door_1 is not locked at least once)
15. gotoroom room_4 room_2 grey_door_1 → now in room_2
16. Now, need to go to room_1 via green_door_1 (which is locked)
17. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_1
18. toggle green_door_1 → unlocks it
19. gotoroom room_2 room_1 green_door_1 → now in room_1
20. Now, in room_1, need to gotoobject red_ball_1 room_1
21. So gotoobject red_ball_1 room_1 → now in front of it. Goal achieved.

Check constraints:

- grey_door_1 is unlocked in step 14 → satisfies "grey_door_1 is not locked" in at least one state.
- yellow_door_1 remains locked throughout → satisfies "yellow_door_1 is locked" in every state.
- agent is in room_1 in step 19 and 20 → satisfies "you are in room_1".
- Before entering room_1 (step 19), the agent was holding blue_box_1 (from step 5 onwards) → satisfies the constraint that when in room_1, there's an earlier state holding an object.
- The agent was in room_3 in steps 1-3, then again in steps 8-10. In step 8, they are in room_3 and holding blue_box_1 → satisfies the constraint that if in room_3, they hold something then or after.
- The agent was in front of green_door_2 in steps 1 and 6 → satisfies "in front of green_door_2".
- In front of yellow_door_1 in step 10 → satisfies that.
- In front of yellow_door_1 while holding blue_box_1 → satisfies the constraint that when in front of yellow_door_1, they hold blue_box_1 then or after. In this case, they are holding it at the same state.
- The agent was in room_2 in step 15-18 → satisfies "you are in room_2".

But wait, when the agent is in room_3 again in step 8, they are holding blue_box_1. So the constraint is satisfied because they are holding an object in that state. Also, any subsequent states after that, even if they are in room_3 again (which they aren't), they would need to hold something. But once they leave room_3 again, they are in room_4, then room_2, then room_1. So the only room_3 states are the initial and steps 8-10. In step 8, they are holding, which satisfies the constraint.

Other points: when the agent toggles green_door_2 in step 2, it's unlocked. When they go back to room_3 in step 8, they could toggle it again to lock, but it's not required. The constraint doesn't care about green_door_2's state. Similarly, green_door_1 is unlocked in step 18, but there's no constraint against that.

But wait, the constraint regarding room_3: the agent was in room_3 in step 8 (after returning from room_4), and they were holding blue_box_1. So that's okay.

Also, the agent has to drop the blue_box_1 somewhere? Or can they carry it to the end? The goal doesn't require dropping. So maybe they carry it to room_1. Then when in room_1, they are holding blue_box_1. But the goal requires being in front of red_ball_1 and in room_1. So they can gotoobject red_ball_1 even while holding blue_box_1. Because the preconditions for gotoobject are that they are in the same room as the object, which they are. So step 20: gotoobject red_ball_1 room_1. Then the goal is achieved. The agent is in room_1, in front of red_ball_1, which is red and in room_1. All constraints are satisfied.

But wait, the agent is holding blue_box_1 when they gotoobject red_ball_1. The preconditions for gotoobject are that they are in the same room as the object. Holding an object doesn't prevent that. So that's allowed.

But the drop action is only needed if they want to put something down. But in this plan, they don't need to drop anything. The goal doesn't require being empty-handed.

So the plan would be:

1. gotodoor green_door_2 room_3 room_4
2. toggle green_door_2
3. gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_2
4. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_4
5. pick blue_box_1 room_4
6. gotodoor green_door_2 room_4 room_3
7. toggle green_door_2 (lock it again? Wait, no, the toggle action toggles the state. Initially, green_door_2 is locked. After step 2, it's unlocked. Then step 7 toggles it again, locking it. But why? It's not necessary unless required for some reason. But if the agent wants to go back to room_3, they can do so through the unlocked door. Wait, after step 2, green_door_2 is unlocked. So when they go back in step 6, gotodoor green_door_2 room_4 room_3, then in step 7, toggle would lock it. But why would they do that? It's not required. So maybe steps 6 and 7 are unnecessary. Let me re-express.

Wait, after step 3, agent is in room_4. Then step 4-5: pick up blue_box_1. Then step 6: gotodoor green_door_2 in room_4 (connecting to room_3). Then step 7: toggle green_door_2 (which is unlocked, so toggling would lock it). But why lock it? It's not needed. So maybe skip step 7. Instead:

After step 5, agent is in room_4, holding blue_box_1. To return to room_3, they need to go to green_door_2 in room_4, then gotoroom to room_3. So steps:

6. gotodoor green_door_2 room_4 room_3
7. gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_2 → now in room_3 again.

Then proceed to step 8: gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1.

So steps 6 and 7 are just moving back to room_3. The door is already unlocked from step 2. So no need to toggle again. So steps would be:

1. gotodoor green_door_2 room_3 room_4
2. toggle green_door_2 (unlock)
3. gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_2
4. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_4
5. pick blue_box_1 room_4
6. gotodoor green_door_2 room_4 room_3
7. gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_2 → now in room_3
8. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1
9. toggle yellow_door_1 → Wait, but the constraint says yellow_door_1 must remain locked. So we can't unlock it. So the toggle action here would unlock it, which violates the constraint. Wait, no. The agent is in front of yellow_door_1. The current state of yellow_door_1 is locked. So toggle would unlock it, but the constraint says it must always be locked. So this is a problem. Therefore, step 9 cannot include toggling yellow_door_1. So the agent can't toggle it. So they can't go through it. But they just need to be in front of it. So step 8 is gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1. Then proceed without toggling. So after step 8, the agent is in front of yellow_door_1, which is locked. Then they need to go back to room_3's green_door_2 to proceed.

Wait, but after step 8, the agent is in front of yellow_door_1. To proceed, they need to go to another door. But yellow_door_1 is locked and must stay locked. So they can't use it. So after step 8, the agent is in front of yellow_door_1, and must go back to green_door_2 to go to room_4 again.

So steps would proceed:

After step 8 (gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1), the agent is in front of it. Now, they need to go to room_4 again via green_door_2 (already unlocked), then to room_2 via grey_door_1.

But the agent is in room_3, so steps after step 8 would be:

9. gotodoor green_door_2 room_3 room_4
10. gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_2 → in room_4 again
11. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_2
12. toggle grey_door_1 (unlock)
13. gotoroom room_4 room_2 grey_door_1 → now in room_2
14. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_1
15. toggle green_door_1 (unlock)
16. gotoroom room_2 room_1 green_door_1 → now in room_1
17. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_1

But wait, when the agent is in room_2, step 14: gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_1. Then toggle to unlock. Then go to room_1.

But the agent is holding blue_box_1 the entire time, which satisfies the constraint that when entering room_1, they had held an object before. So that's okay.

But this adds more steps. Let's count the steps:

1. gotodoor green_door_2 room_3 room_4
2. toggle green_door_2
3. gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_2
4. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_4
5. pick blue_box_1 room_4
6. gotodoor green_door_2 room_4 room_3
7. gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_2
8. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1
9. gotodoor green_door_2 room_3 room_4
10. gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_2
11. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_2
12. toggle grey_door_1
13. gotoroom room_4 room_2 grey_door_1
14. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_1
15. toggle green_door_1
16. gotoroom room_2 room_1 green_door_1
17. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_1

This seems long. But perhaps it's necessary. Let's check the constraints again:

- grey_door_1 is unlocked in step 12 → satisfied.
- yellow_door_1 remains locked → yes, since step 8 only goes in front of it, no toggle.
- agent in room_1 at step 16-17 → yes.
- agent held object (blue_box_1) before room_1 (step 5 onwards) → yes.
- agent in room_3 at steps 1,7-8 → yes, and in those steps, held object in step 5 onwards → satisfied.
- agent in front of green_door_2 in steps 1,6,9 → yes.
- agent in front of yellow_door_1 in step 8 → yes, and holding blue_box_1 → satisfies the constraint.
- agent in room_2 in step 13-15 → yes.

So this plan meets all constraints and the goal. But is it optimal? Let's see if there's a shorter path.

Alternative approach: Instead of going back to room_3 after picking up blue_box_1, can the agent proceed directly from room_4 to room_2 via grey_door_1?

Yes. So steps:

1. gotodoor green_door_2 room_3 room_4
2. toggle green_door_2 (unlock)
3. gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_2 → room_4
4. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_4
5. pick blue_box_1 room_4
6. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_2
7. toggle grey_door_1 (unlock)
8. gotoroom room_4 room_2 grey_door_1 → room_2
9. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_1
10. toggle green_door_1 (unlock)
11. gotoroom room_2 room_1 green_door_1 → room_1
12. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_1

But then, the agent hasn't been in front of yellow_door_1. So that's missing. Also, the agent must be in front of yellow_door_1 at least once. So this plan doesn't satisfy that. So we need to include that step.

So the agent needs to get in front of yellow_door_1. How? They are in room_3 initially. So after step 3 (in room_4), they pick up blue_box_1, then go to room_2 via grey_door_1. Then to room_1, but never go back to room_3. So how to get in front of yellow_door_1?

They have to return to room_3. So maybe after step 11, the agent is in room_1. They need to go back to room_3 via yellow_door_1, but it's locked. So can't. Alternatively, from room_1, they can't go back to room_3. So they have to go to room_2, then room_4, then room_3 again. Which complicates things.

Alternatively, after picking up blue_box_1 in room_4 (step 5), the agent goes back to room_3 via green_door_2, then to yellow_door_1. So steps:

6. gotodoor green_door_2 room_4 room_3
7. gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_2 → room_3
8. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1 → in front of yellow_door_1, holding blue_box_1. Satisfies the constraint.
9. Then proceed to go to room_4 again via green_door_2 (unlocked), then to room_2 via grey_door_1 (unlock), then to room_1.

This adds steps but ensures being in front of yellow_door_1. So the plan would be:

1. gotodoor green_door_2 room_3 room_4
2. toggle green_door_2
3. gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_2
4. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_4
5. pick blue_box_1 room_4
6. gotodoor green_door_2 room_4 room_3
7. gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_2
8. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1
9. gotodoor green_door_2 room_3 room_4
10. gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_2
11. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_2
12. toggle grey_door_1
13. gotoroom room_4 room_2 grey_door_1
14. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_1
15. toggle green_door_1
16. gotoroom room_2 room_1 green_door_1
17. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_1

This plan has 17 steps, but maybe it's possible to optimize. For example, after step 8 (in front of yellow_door_1), can the agent go directly to green_door_2 and proceed without going back to room_3 again? Wait, after step 8, the agent is in room_3, in front of yellow_door_1. Then they can go to green_door_2 in room_3 (step 9), then to room_4 (step 10), then to grey_door_1 (step 11), unlock, and so on. That seems necessary.

But is there a shorter path? Let's think differently. Maybe the agent doesn't need to go back to room_3 after step 7. Instead, after step 7 (back in room_3), gotodoor yellow_door_1 (step 8), then proceed to room_4 via green_door_2 again. So steps 9-10 are necessary.

Alternatively, maybe after step 8, the agent can go directly to room_4 via green_door_2, but that's what the current plan does. So it's unavoidable.

Alternatively, could the agent pick up a different object in room_3 initially to satisfy the holding constraint and then use that to satisfy the yellow_door_1 constraint? For example, pick up grey_ball_2 in room_3. But the constraint for yellow_door_1 requires holding blue_box_1. So no, that won't work. The constraint says that if you are in front of yellow_door_1, you must be holding blue_box_1 at that time or after. So the agent must hold blue_box_1 at some point when or after being in front of yellow_door_1. So they can't use another object.

Thus, the plan must include picking up blue_box_1 and being in front of yellow_door_1 while holding it.

Therefore, the steps outlined earlier seem necessary.

But let's check for optimality. The plan has 17 steps, but maybe there's a way to reduce.

For example, after step 5 (holding blue_box_1 in room_4), instead of returning to room_3, could the agent go to grey_door_1 directly? But they need to be in front of yellow_door_1. So no, unless there's a way to be in front of yellow_door_1 without returning to room_3. But yellow_door_1 is in room_3 and room_1. The agent is in room_4, so can't get to yellow_door_1 from there. So they must return to room_3.

Thus, the plan is as follows.
