Let me understand the problem step by step and then devise a plan.

The gridworld has 4 rooms arranged in a square:
- room_1 (north-west)
- room_2 (south-west)
- room_3 (north-east)
- room_4 (south-east)

Rooms are connected by doors:
- green_door_1 connects room_1 and room_2
- yellow_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3
- grey_door_1 connects room_2 and room_4
- green_door_2 connects room_3 and room_4

I start in room_3, and all doors are locked.

Objects in the rooms:
- room_1: yellow_box_1, grey_ball_1, red_ball_1
- room_2: (empty)
- room_3: purple_box_1, grey_ball_2, purple_ball_1
- room_4: purple_ball_2, blue_box_1

My goal is to be in room_1, in front of red_ball_1.

Let's analyze the constraints:
1. "grey_door_1 is not locked" must be true at least once
2. "yellow_door_1 is locked" must be true in every state (I can never unlock it)
3. "you are in room_1" must be true at least once (part of my goal)
4. If I am in room_1, I must have been holding an object earlier
5. "you are in room_3" must be true at least once (I start here)
6. If I am in room_3, I must hold an object at that state or later
7. "you are in front of green_door_2" must be true at least once
8. "you are in front of yellow_door_1" must be true at least once
9. If I am in front of yellow_door_1, I must hold blue_box_1 at that state or later
10. "you are in room_2" must be true at least once

Let me plan a path to satisfy these constraints and reach the goal:

Starting state:
- I am in room_3
- I need to pick up an object to satisfy constraint #6
- I need to go to room_4 to get blue_box_1 to satisfy constraint #9
- I need to go to room_2 to satisfy constraint #10
- I need to go to room_1 to achieve the goal

Since yellow_door_1 must remain locked (constraint #2), I cannot directly go from room_3 to room_1. I need to follow a path like room_3 → room_4 → room_2 → room_1.

Here's a draft plan:

1. First, to satisfy constraint #6, I need to pick up an object while in room_3:
   - gotoobject grey_ball_2 room_3
   - pick grey_ball_2 room_3

2. To satisfy constraint #7, I need to go in front of green_door_2:
   - gotodoor green_door_2 room_3 room_4
   - toggle green_door_2 (unlock it)

3. Go to room_4:
   - gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_2

4. Drop the grey_ball_2 since I'll need to pick up blue_box_1:
   - gotoempty
   - drop grey_ball_2 room_4

5. Pick up blue_box_1:
   - gotoobject blue_box_1 room_4
   - pick blue_box_1 room_4

6. Go to door connecting room_4 and room_2:
   - gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_2
   - toggle grey_door_1 (to satisfy constraint #1)

7. Go to room_2:
   - gotoroom room_4 room_2 grey_door_1 (to satisfy constraint #10)

8. Go to the door connecting room_2 and room_1:
   - gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_1
   - toggle green_door_1 (unlock it)

9. Go to room_1:
   - gotoroom room_2 room_1 green_door_1 (to satisfy constraint #3 and #4 since I'm holding blue_box_1)

10. To satisfy constraint #8 and #9, I need to go to yellow_door_1 while holding blue_box_1:
    - gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3

11. Now I can drop blue_box_1 and go to the goal:
    - gotoempty
    - drop blue_box_1 room_1
    - gotoobject red_ball_1 room_1

This plan should satisfy all constraints and achieve the goal.

Wait, let me check once more if there's a problem with this plan:

Constraint #1: "grey_door_1 is not locked" - Yes, I unlock it.
Constraint #2: "yellow_door_1 is locked" - Yes, I never unlock it.
Constraint #3: "you are in room_1" - Yes, I go to room_1.
Constraint #4: I need to hold an object before going to room_1 - Yes, I'll be holding blue_box_1.
Constraint #5: "you are in room_3" - Yes, I start there.
Constraint #6: In room_3, I must hold an object at that state or later - Yes, I pick up grey_ball_2.
Constraint #7: "you are in front of green_door_2" - Yes, I go to green_door_2.
Constraint #8: "you are in front of yellow_door_1" - Yes, I go to yellow_door_1.
Constraint #9: At yellow_door_1, I must hold blue_box_1 at that state or later - Yes, I'm holding blue_box_1.
Constraint #10: "you are in room_2" - Yes, I go to room_2.

But I notice I'm at room_3 at the start so I've already satisfied constraint #5. Also, constraint #6 says "If you are in room_3, you must be holding some object at that state or later". Since I'll pick up grey_ball_2 later, this constraint is already satisfied.

Let me verify my plan once more:

1. In room_3 (constraint #5 satisfied)
2. gotoobject grey_ball_2 room_3
3. pick grey_ball_2 room_3 (constraint #6 satisfied)
4. gotodoor green_door_2 room_3 room_4 (constraint #7 satisfied)
5. toggle green_door_2
6. gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_2
7. gotoempty
8. drop grey_ball_2 room_4
9. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_4
10. pick blue_box_1 room_4
11. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_2
12. toggle grey_door_1 (constraint #1 satisfied)
13. gotoroom room_4 room_2 grey_door_1 (constraint #10 satisfied)
14. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_1
15. toggle green_door_1
16. gotoroom room_2 room_1 green_door_1 (constraints #3 and #4 satisfied)
17. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3 (constraint #8 satisfied)
18. (I'm holding blue_box_1 at this point, so constraint #9 is satisfied)
19. gotoempty
20. drop blue_box_1 room_1
21. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_1 (goal satisfied)

This plan should work and satisfy all constraints.

Actually, I want to double-check the actions to make sure I understand them correctly:

"gotoobject x r": Go in front of to object x in room r.
- I need to be in room r to do this.

"gotoempty": Go in front of an empty position of the room, which does not contain any object.
- This can be done anytime I'm in a room.

"gotodoor d r1 r2": Go in front of door d, connecting room r1 to room r2.
- I need to be in room r1 to go to the door connecting to r2.

"gotoroom r1 r2 d": Go to room r2 from room r1 using door d.
- I need to be in room r1 and in front of door d, and door d must be unlocked.

"pick x r": Pick up object x in room r.
- I need to be in room r and in front of object x, and not holding anything.

"drop x r": Drop object x in room r.
- I need to be in room r, holding object x, and in front of an empty space.

"toggle d": Unlock door d if is locked. Lock door d if is unlocked.
- I need to be in front of door d.

Upon reflection, there might be issues with my plan. Let me review more carefully:

1. I start in room_3
2. gotoobject grey_ball_2 room_3
3. pick grey_ball_2 room_3
4. gotodoor green_door_2 room_3 room_4
5. toggle green_door_2
6. gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_2
7. gotoempty
8. drop grey_ball_2 room_4
9. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_4
10. pick blue_box_1 room_4
11. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_2
12. toggle grey_door_1
13. gotoroom room_4 room_2 grey_door_1
14. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_1
15. toggle green_door_1
16. gotoroom room_2 room_1 green_door_1
17. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3
18. gotoempty
19. drop blue_box_1 room_1
20. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_1

I believe this plan is correct and satisfies all constraints.

Wait, I see a potential issue. Let me check again:

Constraint #9: "If expression 'you are in front of yellow_door_1' holds in some state s, then expression 'you are holding blue_box_1' must hold at s or at some state after s"

In my plan, I go to yellow_door_1 in room_1 (step 17), then I drop blue_box_1 (step 19). This satisfies constraint #9 because I'm holding blue_box_1 when I'm in front of yellow_door_1.

So I think my plan is correct. Let me finalize it:

```
gotoobject grey_ball_2 room_3
pick grey_ball_2 room_3
gotodoor green_door_2 room_3 room_4
toggle green_door_2
gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_2
gotoempty
drop grey_ball_2 room_4
gotoobject blue_box_1 room_4
pick blue_box_1 room_4
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_2
toggle grey_door_1
gotoroom room_4 room_2 grey_door_1
gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_1
toggle green_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_1 green_door_1
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3
gotoempty
drop blue_box_1 room_1
gotoobject red_ball_1 room_1
```

This plan satisfies all constraints and achieves the goal of being in room_1 in front of red_ball_1.

Hmm, let me check the validity of the plan once more, following all preconditions and effects carefully:

1. I start in room_3.
2. "gotoobject grey_ball_2 room_3" - I can do this because I'm in room_3 and grey_ball_2 is in room_3.
3. "pick grey_ball_2 room_3" - I can do this because I'm in front of grey_ball_2 and my hands are empty.
4. "gotodoor green_door_2 room_3 room_4" - I can do this because I'm in room_3 and green_door_2 connects room_3 and room_4.
5. "toggle green_door_2" - I can do this because I'm in front of green_door_2. This unlocks green_door_2.
6. "gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_2" - I can do this because I'm in room_3, green_door_2 is unlocked, and it connects to room_4.
7. "gotoempty" - I can do this anytime.
8. "drop grey_ball_2 room_4" - I can do this because I'm holding grey_ball_2, I'm in room_4, and I'm in front of an empty space.
9. "gotoobject blue_box_1 room_4" - I can do this because I'm in room_4 and blue_box_1 is in room_4.
10. "pick blue_box_1 room_4" - I can do this because I'm in front of blue_box_1, I'm in room_4, and my hands are empty.
11. "gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_2" - I can do this because I'm in room_4 and grey_door_1 connects room_4 and room_2.
12. "toggle grey_door_1" - I can do this because I'm in front of grey_door_1. This unlocks grey_door_1.
13. "gotoroom room_4 room_2 grey_door_1" - I can do this because I'm in room_4, grey_door_1 is unlocked, and it connects to room_2.
14. "gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_1" - I can do this because I'm in room_2 and green_door_1 connects room_2 and room_1.
15. "toggle green_door_1" - I can do this because I'm in front of green_door_1. This unlocks green_door_1.
16. "gotoroom room_2 room_1 green_door_1" - I can do this because I'm in room_2, green_door_1 is unlocked, and it connects to room_1.
17. "gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3" - I can do this because I'm in room_1 and yellow_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3.
18. "gotoempty" - I can do this anytime.
19. "drop blue_box_1 room_1" - I can do this because I'm holding blue_box_1, I'm in room_1, and I'm in front of an empty space.
20. "gotoobject red_ball_1 room_1" - I can do this because I'm in room_1 and red_ball_1 is in room_1.

The plan seems valid according to the action definitions, preconditions, and effects. It satisfies all constraints and achieves the goal of being in room_1 in front of red_ball_1.

However, I realize there might be a shorter plan that achieves the same goal while still satisfying all constraints. Let me revisit:

Constraint #6 says "If expression 'you are in room_3' holds in some state s, then expression 'you are holding some object' must hold at s or at some state after s." Since I start in room_3, I must pick up an object at some point.

Constraint #9 says "If expression 'you are in front of yellow_door_1' holds in some state s, then expression 'you are holding blue_box_1' must hold at s or at some state after s." This means I must pick up blue_box_1 before or after I'm in front of yellow_door_1.

I need to go through room_2 (constraint #10) and be in front of green_door_2 (constraint #7).

I can't use yellow_door_1 because it must remain locked (constraint #2).

Let me reconsider the plan:

1. Start in room_3 (constraint #5 satisfied)
2. gotoobject purple_box_1 room_3
3. pick purple_box_1 room_3 (constraint #6 satisfied)
4. gotodoor green_door_2 room_3 room_4 (constraint #7 satisfied)
5. toggle green_door_2
6. gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_2
7. gotoempty
8. drop purple_box_1 room_4
9. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_4
10. pick blue_box_1 room_4
11. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_2
12. toggle grey_door_1 (constraint #1 satisfied)
13. gotoroom room_4 room_2 grey_door_1 (constraint #10 satisfied)
14. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_1
15. toggle green_door_1
16. gotoroom room_2 room_1 green_door_1 (constraints #3 and #4 satisfied)
17. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3 (constraints #8 and #9 satisfied)
18. gotoempty
19. drop blue_box_1 room_1
20. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_1 (goal satisfied)

This plan works too. In fact, I could pick any object in room_3 to satisfy constraint #6.

Is this the shortest plan? Let me think...

Actually, I think the plan is optimal. To satisfy all constraints, I need to:
- Start in room_3 (given)
- Pick up an object in room_3 (to satisfy constraint #6)
- Go to green_door_2 (to satisfy constraint #7)
- Get to room_4 to pick up blue_box_1 (needed for constraint #9)
- Go through grey_door_1 and unlock it (to satisfy constraint #1)
- Go to room_2 (to satisfy constraint #10)
- Go to room_1 (to satisfy constraint #3 and reach the goal)
- Go to yellow_door_1 while holding blue_box_1 (to satisfy constraints #8 and #9)
- Finally, go to red_ball_1 (the ultimate goal)

I don't see a way to achieve all of these with fewer steps.

Let me make one final check to ensure this is the optimal plan:

```
gotoobject purple_box_1 room_3
pick purple_box_1 room_3
gotodoor green_door_2 room_3 room_4
toggle green_door_2
gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_2
gotoempty
drop purple_box_1 room_4
gotoobject blue_box_1 room_4
pick blue_box_1 room_4
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_2
toggle grey_door_1
gotoroom room_4 room_2 grey_door_1
gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_1
toggle green_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_1 green_door_1
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3
gotoempty
drop blue_box_1 room_1
gotoobject red_ball_1 room_1
```

Actually, I see I can skip the steps with purple_box_1 and just directly pick up blue_box_1 in room_4. This would satisfy constraint #6 because I will still be holding an object (blue_box_1) after being in room_3.

Let me correct the plan:

1. Start in room_3 (constraint #5 satisfied)
2. gotodoor green_door_2 room_3 room_4 (constraint #7 satisfied)
3. toggle green_door_2
4. gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_2
5. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_4
6. pick blue_box_1 room_4 (constraint #6 satisfied because I'm holding an object after being in room_3)
7. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_2
8. toggle grey_door_1 (constraint #1 satisfied)
9. gotoroom room_4 room_2 grey_door_1 (constraint #10 satisfied)
10. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_1
11. toggle green_door_1
12. gotoroom room_2 room_1 green_door_1 (constraints #3 and #4 satisfied)
13. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3 (constraints #8 and #9 satisfied)
14. gotoempty
15. drop blue_box_1 room_1
16. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_1 (goal satisfied)

This is a shorter plan with 16 steps instead of 20, but it still satisfies all constraints and achieves the goal.

Actually, I'm not sure this shorter plan satisfies constraint #6. Let me revisit it:

Constraint #6: "If expression 'you are in room_3' holds in some state s, then expression 'you are holding some object' must hold at s or at some state after s"

In the shorter plan, I start in room_3, then I go to room_4, then I pick up blue_box_1. This satisfies constraint #6 because I'm holding an object (blue_box_1) after being in room_3.

So the shorter plan is valid and optimal.

Final optimal plan:
```
gotodoor green_door_2 room_3 room_4
toggle green_door_2
gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_2
gotoobject blue_box_1 room_4
pick blue_box_1 room_4
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_2
toggle grey_door_1
gotoroom room_4 room_2 grey_door_1
gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_1
toggle green_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_1 green_door_1
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3
gotoempty
drop blue_box_1 room_1
gotoobject red_ball_1 room_1
```

This plan is optimal, valid, and satisfies all constraints.
