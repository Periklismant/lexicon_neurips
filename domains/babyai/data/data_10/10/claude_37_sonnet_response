Alright, so I need to create a plan that brings about the goal: "There is a box v such that "The following conditions are all true: "v is grey", "you are in front of v""". In other words, I need to end up in front of the grey box, which is `grey_box_1`. Additionally, there are several constraints that must be satisfied during the execution of the plan.

Let's start by analyzing the initial state:

1. I'm in room_1.
2. green_box_1 and grey_box_1 are in room_1.
3. blue_ball_1, blue_ball_2, yellow_box_1, and green_ball_1 are in room_2.
4. purple_box_1 and red_ball_1 are in room_4.
5. All doors (purple_door_1, grey_door_1, blue_door_1, green_door_1) are locked.
6. I'm not holding any object.

Now, let's check the constraints I need to satisfy during the plan execution:

1. At some point, I need to be in front of blue_ball_2 (which is in room_2).
2. At some point, I need to be in room_3.
3. At some point, I need to be in front of red_ball_1 in room_4.
4. At some point, I need to be holding blue_ball_2.
5. At some point, I need to either be in front of purple_box_1 OR grey_door_1 should be unlocked.
6. At some point, blue_ball_2 needs to be in room_3.
7. At some point, green_box_1 needs to be in room_2.
8. At some point, I need to be holding some object while in room_2.
9. At some point, I need to be in front of an empty space.

Let's think about the goal: I need to end up in front of the grey box (grey_box_1), which is currently in room_1. Since the goal doesn't specify which room I should be in, as long as I'm in the same room as the grey box and I'm in front of it, it should satisfy the goal.

Now, let's plan with the constraints in mind:

1. First, since I'm in room_1 and the grey box is also in room_1, I should first go in front of the grey box.
2. To satisfy the constraint about being in front of an empty space, I'll do that next in room_1.
3. I'll then need to go to room_2. But to do that, I need to unlock the purple door. So, I'll go in front of the purple door, toggle it to unlock it, and then proceed to room_2.
4. Once in room_2, I'll go in front of blue_ball_2 to satisfy that constraint.
5. I'll then pick up blue_ball_2 to satisfy the constraint about holding it.
6. I need to have green_box_1 in room_2, so I'll go back to room_1, pick up green_box_1, and take it to room_2. This also ensures I'm holding an object while in room_2.
7. Next, to bring blue_ball_2 to room_3, I'll need to go back to room_1, unlock the grey door, and then proceed to room_3 with blue_ball_2. Once in room_3, I'll drop blue_ball_2.
8. For the constraint requiring me to be in front of red_ball_1 in room_4, I'll need to unlock the door between room_3 and room_4, go to room_4, and then go in front of red_ball_1.
9. At this point, I need to decide how to satisfy the constraint about either being in front of purple_box_1 or having grey_door_1 unlocked. Since I need to go through the grey door to go to room_3, I've already satisfied this constraint by unlocking the grey door.
10. Finally, to accomplish the goal, I need to return to room_1 and go in front of the grey box.

Let's draft a plan:

1. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_1    (satisfies the goal and also the constraint about facing grey_box_1)
2. gotoempty    (satisfies constraint about facing an empty space)
3. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2    (to get to purple_door_1)
4. toggle purple_door_1    (unlock door to room_2)
5. gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1    (go to room_2)
6. gotoobject blue_ball_2 room_2    (satisfies constraint about facing blue_ball_2)
7. pick blue_ball_2 room_2    (satisfies constraint about holding blue_ball_2)
8. gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1    (return to room_1 to get green_box_1)
9. drop blue_ball_2 room_1    (drop blue_ball_2 temporarily to pick up green_box_1)
10. gotoobject green_box_1 room_1    (prepare to pick up green_box_1)
11. pick green_box_1 room_1    (pick up green_box_1)
12. gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1    (take green_box_1 to room_2, satisfying the constraint about green_box_1 being in room_2 and also holding an object while in room_2)
13. drop green_box_1 room_2    (drop green_box_1 in room_2)
14. gotoobject blue_ball_2 room_1    (back to room_1 to pick blue_ball_2 again)
15. pick blue_ball_2 room_1    (pick up blue_ball_2)
16. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_3    (get to grey_door_1)
17. toggle grey_door_1    (unlock door to room_3, satisfying constraint about grey_door_1 being unlocked)
18. gotoroom room_1 room_3 grey_door_1    (go to room_3, satisfying constraint about being in room_3)
19. drop blue_ball_2 room_3    (drop blue_ball_2 in room_3, satisfying the constraint about blue_ball_2 being in room_3)
20. gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4    (get to the door to room_4)
21. toggle green_door_1    (unlock door to room_4)
22. gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_1    (go to room_4)
23. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_4    (satisfies constraint about facing red_ball_1 in room_4)
24. gotoobject purple_box_1 room_4    (satisfies constraint about facing purple_box_1)
25. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_4 room_2    (get to door to room_2)
26. toggle blue_door_1    (unlock door to room_2)
27. gotoroom room_4 room_2 blue_door_1    (go to room_2)
28. gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1    (return to room_1)
29. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_1    (go in front of grey_box_1, achieving the goal)

Wait, let me review this plan again to make sure all the constraints are satisfied and there are no logical errors.

Hmm, there might be an issue in steps 14-15. If blue_ball_2 is in room_1, I can pick it up again, but originally blue_ball_2 is in room_2, and I dropped blue_ball_2 in room_1 in step 9. So steps 14-15 are correct.

Let me double-check the constraints again:

1. `you are in front of blue_ball_2`: Satisfied in step 6.
2. `you are in room_3`: Satisfied in step 18.
3. `The following conditions are all true: "you are in front of red_ball_1", "you are in room_4"`: Satisfied in step 23.
4. `you are holding blue_ball_2`: Satisfied in step 7.
5. `At least one of the following conditions is true: "you are in front of purple_box_1", "grey_door_1 is not locked"`: Satisfied in step 17 (grey_door_1 is unlocked) and step 24 (in front of purple_box_1).
6. `blue_ball_2 is in room_3`: Satisfied in step 19.
7. `green_box_1 is in room_2`: Satisfied in step 13.
8. `The following conditions are all true: "you are holding some object", "you are in room_2"`: Satisfied in step 12 (holding green_box_1 in room_2).
9. `you are in front of empty`: Satisfied in step 2.

And the goal:
`There is a box v such that "The following conditions are all true: "v is grey", "you are in front of v"""`: Satisfied in step 29.

Based on this review, the plan seems logically sound, but let me check if there's a more efficient way to achieve the goal and satisfy all the constraints.

Actually, let me think if this is an optimal solution. We've a lot of going back and forth between different rooms. Let's see if we can optimize it.

Here's an optimized plan:

1. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_1    (satisfies the goal - facing grey_box_1 and also serves as a starting point)
2. gotoempty    (satisfies constraint about facing an empty space)
3. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2    (get to purple_door_1)
4. toggle purple_door_1    (unlock door to room_2)
5. gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1    (go to room_2)
6. gotoobject blue_ball_2 room_2    (satisfies constraint about facing blue_ball_2)
7. pick blue_ball_2 room_2    (satisfies constraint about holding blue_ball_2 and holding an object while in room_2)
8. gotoobject green_box_1 room_1    (go in front of green_box_1)
9. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1    (go back to room_1, but we can't do that while holding the ball; we need to be in front of the purple door)
10. drop blue_ball_2 room_2    (drop blue_ball_2 temporarily to go back to room_1)

Actually, hold on, let me step back and reconsider. I think there's still the issue with the constraints and the optimal plan. Let me rethink this from the beginning.

Let's go step by step:

1. Initial state: I'm in room_1, green_box_1 and grey_box_1 are in room_1, all doors are locked, and I'm not holding anything.
2. Goal: I need to be in front of grey_box_1, which is in room_1.

Since the goal is already achievable from the initial state (I just need to go in front of grey_box_1), I could do that right away. But I first need to satisfy all the constraints.

Let me just try to create a plan from scratch, focusing on minimizing steps.

1. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_1    (this satisfies the goal, I can end here if there are no constraints)
2. gotoempty    (satisfies the constraint about facing an empty space)
3. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2    (prepare to go to room_2)
4. toggle purple_door_1    (unlock door to room_2)
5. gotoobject green_box_1 room_1    (prepare to pick up green_box_1)
6. pick green_box_1 room_1    (pick up green_box_1 to take it to room_2)
7. gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1    (go to room_2 with green_box_1, satisfying the constraint about holding an object while in room_2)
8. drop green_box_1 room_2    (drop green_box_1 in room_2, satisfying the constraint about green_box_1 being in room_2)
9. gotoobject blue_ball_2 room_2    (go in front of blue_ball_2, satisfying the constraint about facing blue_ball_2)
10. pick blue_ball_2 room_2    (pick up blue_ball_2, satisfying the constraint about holding blue_ball_2)
11. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_3    (I need to go to the grey door in room_1, but I'm in room_2 holding blue_ball_2)
12. gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1    (return to room_1 with blue_ball_2)
13. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_3    (go to the grey door in room_1)
14. toggle grey_door_1    (unlock grey_door_1, satisfying the constraint about grey_door_1 being unlocked)
15. gotoroom room_1 room_3 grey_door_1    (go to room_3 with blue_ball_2, satisfying the constraint about being in room_3)
16. drop blue_ball_2 room_3    (drop blue_ball_2 in room_3, satisfying the constraint about blue_ball_2 being in room_3)
17. gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4    (go to the green door in room_3)
18. toggle green_door_1    (unlock the door to room_4)
19. gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_1    (go to room_4)
20. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_4    (go in front of red_ball_1 in room_4, satisfying the constraint about facing red_ball_1 in room_4)
21. gotoobject purple_box_1 room_4    (go in front of purple_box_1, satisfying the constraint about facing purple_box_1)
22. gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1    (return to room_3)
23. gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1    (return to room_1)
24. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_1    (go in front of grey_box_1, achieving the goal)

This plan satisfies all constraints and achieves the goal. However, I'm still not sure if it's optimal in terms of the number of steps. Let's review to see if we can further optimize it.

Let me double-check the constraints one more time:

1. `you are in front of blue_ball_2`: Satisfied in step 9.
2. `you are in room_3`: Satisfied in step 15.
3. `The following conditions are all true: "you are in front of red_ball_1", "you are in room_4"`: Satisfied in step 20.
4. `you are holding blue_ball_2`: Satisfied in step 10.
5. `At least one of the following conditions is true: "you are in front of purple_box_1", "grey_door_1 is not locked"`: Satisfied in step 14 (grey_door_1 is unlocked) and step 21 (in front of purple_box_1).
6. `blue_ball_2 is in room_3`: Satisfied in step 16.
7. `green_box_1 is in room_2`: Satisfied in step 8.
8. `The following conditions are all true: "you are holding some object", "you are in room_2"`: Satisfied in step 7 (holding green_box_1 in room_2).
9. `you are in front of empty`: Satisfied in step 2.

And the goal:
`There is a box v such that "The following conditions are all true: "v is grey", "you are in front of v"""`: Satisfied in step 24.

This plan seems to satisfy all the constraints and is relatively efficient. Let's see if there's a way to further optimize it.

Actually, there's an optimization I can make. Steps 11-13 are redundant. After picking up blue_ball_2 in room_2, I can directly go back to room_1 and then to the grey door. I'll adjust the plan:

1. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_1    (this satisfies the goal, I can end here if there are no constraints)
2. gotoempty    (satisfies the constraint about facing an empty space)
3. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2    (prepare to go to room_2)
4. toggle purple_door_1    (unlock door to room_2)
5. gotoobject green_box_1 room_1    (prepare to pick up green_box_1)
6. pick green_box_1 room_1    (pick up green_box_1 to take it to room_2)
7. gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1    (go to room_2 with green_box_1, satisfying the constraint about holding an object while in room_2)
8. drop green_box_1 room_2    (drop green_box_1 in room_2, satisfying the constraint about green_box_1 being in room_2)
9. gotoobject blue_ball_2 room_2    (go in front of blue_ball_2, satisfying the constraint about facing blue_ball_2)
10. pick blue_ball_2 room_2    (pick up blue_ball_2, satisfying the constraint about holding blue_ball_2)
11. gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1    (return to room_1 with blue_ball_2)
12. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_3    (go to the grey door in room_1)
13. toggle grey_door_1    (unlock grey_door_1, satisfying the constraint about grey_door_1 being unlocked)
14. gotoroom room_1 room_3 grey_door_1    (go to room_3 with blue_ball_2, satisfying the constraint about being in room_3)
15. drop blue_ball_2 room_3    (drop blue_ball_2 in room_3, satisfying the constraint about blue_ball_2 being in room_3)
16. gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4    (go to the green door in room_3)
17. toggle green_door_1    (unlock the door to room_4)
18. gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_1    (go to room_4)
19. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_4    (go in front of red_ball_1 in room_4, satisfying the constraint about facing red_ball_1 in room_4)
20. gotoobject purple_box_1 room_4    (go in front of purple_box_1, satisfying the constraint about facing purple_box_1)
21. gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1    (return to room_3)
22. gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1    (return to room_1)
23. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_1    (go in front of grey_box_1, achieving the goal)

Okay, this is a bit more optimized, but I realized that I've been thinking about it the wrong way. The goal is to be in front of a grey box. The only grey box in the initial state is grey_box_1, which is in room_1. I just need to make sure all the constraints are satisfied, and then end up in front of grey_box_1.

Let's optimize this plan further:

1. gotoempty    (satisfies the constraint about facing an empty space)
2. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2    (prepare to go to room_2)
3. toggle purple_door_1    (unlock door to room_2)
4. gotoobject green_box_1 room_1    (prepare to pick up green_box_1)
5. pick green_box_1 room_1    (pick up green_box_1 to take it to room_2)
6. gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1    (go to room_2 with green_box_1, satisfying the constraint about holding an object while in room_2)
7. drop green_box_1 room_2    (drop green_box_1 in room_2, satisfying the constraint about green_box_1 being in room_2)
8. gotoobject blue_ball_2 room_2    (go in front of blue_ball_2, satisfying the constraint about facing blue_ball_2)
9. pick blue_ball_2 room_2    (pick up blue_ball_2, satisfying the constraint about holding blue_ball_2)
10. gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1    (return to room_1 with blue_ball_2)
11. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_3    (go to the grey door in room_1)
12. toggle grey_door_1    (unlock grey_door_1, satisfying the constraint about grey_door_1 being unlocked)
13. gotoroom room_1 room_3 grey_door_1    (go to room_3 with blue_ball_2, satisfying the constraint about being in room_3)
14. drop blue_ball_2 room_3    (drop blue_ball_2 in room_3, satisfying the constraint about blue_ball_2 being in room_3)
15. gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4    (go to the green door in room_3)
16. toggle green_door_1    (unlock the door to room_4)
17. gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_1    (go to room_4)
18. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_4    (go in front of red_ball_1 in room_4, satisfying the constraint about facing red_ball_1 in room_4)
19. gotoobject purple_box_1 room_4    (go in front of purple_box_1, satisfying the constraint about facing purple_box_1)
20. gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1    (return to room_3)
21. gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1    (return to room_1)
22. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_1    (go in front of grey_box_1, achieving the goal)

Upon further review, this is the most optimized plan I can think of to achieve the goal and satisfy all constraints. It takes 22 steps.

Let me summarize the plan again:

```
gotoempty
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2
toggle purple_door_1
gotoobject green_box_1 room_1
pick green_box_1 room_1
gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1
drop green_box_1 room_2
gotoobject blue_ball_2 room_2
pick blue_ball_2 room_2
gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_3
toggle grey_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_3 grey_door_1
drop blue_ball_2 room_3
gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4
toggle green_door_1
gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_1
gotoobject red_ball_1 room_4
gotoobject purple_box_1 room_4
gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1
gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1
gotoobject grey_box_1 room_1
```

Actually, I've just realized another mistake in my reasoning. I don't need to visit both purple_box_1 and unlock grey_door_1; I only need to do one or the other according to the constraint "At least one of the following conditions is true: "you are in front of purple_box_1", "grey_door_1 is not locked"". So for efficiency, I could choose to unlock grey_door_1 (which I need to do to get to room_3 anyway).

Also, I don't need to visit both blue_ball_1 and blue_ball_2; I just need to visit one blue ball based on the constraint. Since blue_ball_2 is mentioned in other constraints, I'll stick with that.

Let me revise the plan once more:

```
gotoempty
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2
toggle purple_door_1
gotoobject green_box_1 room_1
pick green_box_1 room_1
gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1
drop green_box_1 room_2
gotoobject blue_ball_2 room_2
pick blue_ball_2 room_2
gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_3
toggle grey_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_3 grey_door_1
drop blue_ball_2 room_3
gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4
toggle green_door_1
gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_1
gotoobject red_ball_1 room_4
gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1
gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1
gotoobject grey_box_1 room_1
```

Wait, I think I need to misinterpretted the constraint about purple_box_1 and grey_door_1. Let's review. The constraints says "At least one of the following conditions is true: "you are in front of purple_box_1", "grey_door_1 is not locked"". This means that at some point in the plan, at least one of these conditions must be true.

If I go in front of purple_box_1, I would need to go to room_4. However, to get to room_4, I need to unlock grey_door_1 (to get to room_3), and then unlock green_door_1 (to get to room_4). If I already have grey_door_1 unlocked, I'd partially satisfied the constraint. So I should probably just stick with grey_door_1 being unlocked.

Actually, the constraint says "At least one of the following conditions is true: "you are in front of purple_box_1", "grey_door_1 is not locked"". This means that at least one of these conditions must be true at some point in the plan.

If grey_door_1 is unlocked at some point, the constraint is satisfied. I will unlock grey_door_1 to get to room_3, so this constraint will be implicitly satisfied.

However, let's re-examine the constraint: "At least one of the following conditions is true: "you are in front of purple_box_1", "grey_door_1 is not locked"". The constraint is only satisfied if I'm in front of purple_box_1 or if grey_door_1 is not locked. It doesn't specify that grey_door_1 needs to be unlocked; it could be satisfied by being in front of purple_box_1.

But I don't see any reasons why it wouldn't be satisfied if grey_door_1 is unlocked. I'm going to proceed with the understanding that grey_door_1 being unlocked satisfies the constraint.

Let's further review the plan. 

Constraints:
1. `you are in front of blue_ball_2`: Satisfied in step 8.
2. `you are in room_3`: Satisfied in step 13 (after going to room_3).
3. `The following conditions are all true: "you are in front of red_ball_1", "you are in room_4"`: Satisfied in step 17 (the step after going to room_4 and then going in front of red_ball_1).
4. `you are holding blue_ball_2`: Satisfied in step 9.
5. `At least one of the following conditions is true: "you are in front of purple_box_1", "grey_door_1 is not locked"`: Satisfied in step 12 (grey_door_1 is unlocked).
6. `blue_ball_2 is in room_3`: Satisfied in step 14.
7. `green_box_1 is in room_2`: Satisfied in step 7.
8. `The following conditions are all true: "you are holding some object", "you are in room_2"`: Satisfied in step 6.
9. `you are in front of empty`: Satisfied in step 1.

I think this plan satisfies all constraints and achieves the goal. But let's reconsider going in front of purple_box_1 again.

The constraint says "At least one of the following conditions is true: "you are in front of purple_box_1", "grey_door_1 is not locked"". It suggests that I need to either be in front of purple_box_1 or have grey_door_1 unlocked at some point. Since I already have grey_door_1 unlocked in the plan, I don't need to be in front of purple_box_1 to satisfy this constraint.

So I think I can remove the step for going in front of purple_box_1.

Wait, let's be more careful about the constraint. It says: "The following expression must hold in at least one state: "At least one of the following conditions is true: "you are in front of purple_box_1", "grey_door_1 is not locked""". This means that at some point in the execution of the plan, either I should be in front of purple_box_1 or grey_door_1 should be unlocked.

Since I unlock grey_door_1 in step 12, this constraint will be satisfied for steps 12 onwards, as long as I don't re-lock grey_door_1 later in the plan (which I don't).

So, I don't need to specifically go in front of purple_box_1 just to satisfy this constraint. I think I can remove this step from my plan.

Here's the updated plan:

```
gotoempty
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2
toggle purple_door_1
gotoobject green_box_1 room_1
pick green_box_1 room_1
gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1
drop green_box_1 room_2
gotoobject blue_ball_2 room_2
pick blue_ball_2 room_2
gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_3
toggle grey_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_3 grey_door_1
drop blue_ball_2 room_3
gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4
toggle green_door_1
gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_1
gotoobject red_ball_1 room_4
gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1
gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1
gotoobject grey_box_1 room_1
```

Let's go through constraints one more time:

1. `you are in front of blue_ball_2`: Satisfied in step 8.
2. `you are in room_3`: Satisfied in step 13 (after going to room_3).
3. `The following conditions are all true: "you are in front of red_ball_1", "you are in room_4"`: Satisfied in step 17 (the step after going to room_4).
4. `you are holding blue_ball_2`: Satisfied in step 9.
5. `At least one of the following conditions is true: "you are in front of purple_box_1", "grey_door_1 is not locked"`: Satisfied in step 12 (grey_door_1 is unlocked).
6. `blue_ball_2 is in room_3`: Satisfied in step 14.
7. `green_box_1 is in room_2`: Satisfied in step 7.
8. `The following conditions are all true: "you are holding some object", "you are in room_2"`: Satisfied in step 6.
9. `you are in front of empty`: Satisfied in step 1.

And the goal:
`There is a box v such that "The following conditions are all true: "v is grey", "you are in front of v"""`: Satisfied in step 20.

This seems correct, and I think this plan is the most optimized I can make it given the constraints.

Here's the final plan:

```
gotoempty
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2
toggle purple_door_1
gotoobject green_box_1 room_1
pick green_box_1 room_1
gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1
drop green_box_1 room_2
gotoobject blue_ball_2 room_2
pick blue_ball_2 room_2
gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_3
toggle grey_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_3 grey_door_1
drop blue_ball_2 room_3
gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4
toggle green_door_1
gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_1
gotoobject red_ball_1 room_4
gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1
gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1
gotoobject grey_box_1 room_1
```

Actually now I'm wondering if I need to be more precise about "empty". Let me revisit the preconditions:

"goto empty": you may go in front of an empty position anytime.

It's not super clear what "empty_0 empty" from the world objects is about, but I assumed this just means "empty position" rather than a specific empty object. And when I execute "gotoempty", it just means I'm going to an empty position.

Actually, I'm confused about what "empty_0 empty" means, becuase it's in the following format: "object type". So "empty_0" is an object and "empty" is it's type? Let me reread the world objects:

The world includes the following objects:
	"empty_0 empty"
	"room room_1"
	"room room_2"
	"room room_3"
	"room room_4"
	"color redtype"
	"color greentype"
	"color bluetype"
	"color yellowtype"
	"color purpletype"
	"color greytype"
	"door purple_door_1"
	"door grey_door_1"
	"door blue_door_1"
	"door green_door_1"
	"ball blue_ball_1"
	"ball blue_ball_2"
	"ball red_ball_1"
	"ball green_ball_1"
	"box green_box_1"
	"box grey_box_1"
	"box purple_box_1"
	"box yellow_box_1"

So actually, "empty_0" is a specific object of type "empty". Thus "gotoempty" is ambiguous, and I can't be sure if that's what's meant. Let's be more specific:

Actually, let's refer to the action description again:

"goto empty": you may go in front of an empty position anytime.

And the effects of goto empty:
"goto empty": After performing this action, (i) if you were in front of some object or door x0, then you are no longer in front of x0 and (ii) you are in front of an empty position.

But now, let's look at the constraint: "you are in front of empty".

This is ambiguous: am I supposed to be in front of an empty position, or am I supposed to be in front of the specific object "empty_0"? If the former, I just execute "gotoempty"; if the latter, I need to execute "gotoobject empty_0 room_X" (where X is the room containing empty_0, but I don't know where empty_0 is).

Given the ambiguous constraint, I'll assume I'm supposed to be in front of an empty position.

But wait actually, I just realized that the constraint `you are in front of empty` probably means `you are in front of empty_0`, which is a specific object in the domain. But I don't know which room empty_0 is in, so I don't know how to get to it.

Hmm, I'm quite confused. Let me double check the constraint again: "you are in front of empty". It's unclear to me if this means "you are in front of an empty position" or "you are in front of the object empty_0".

Let me reread the action description once more:

"goto empty": you may go in front of an empty position anytime.

And the effect is: "goto empty": After performing this action, (i) if you were in front of some object or door x0, then you are no longer in front of x0 and (ii) you are in front of an empty position.

So when I execute "gotoempty", the effect is that I'm in front of an empty position. But the constraint is "you are in front of empty", which is ambiguous. Let me assume that "empty" is just a shorthand for "an empty position", and that executing "gotoempty" satisfies the constraint. If I'm wrong, I apologize.

So this means if I execute "gotoempty" at any point, it should satisfy the constraint about being in front of an empty position.

Ok, with that clarification (or guesswork) out of the way, I think my plan is correct:

```
gotoempty
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2
toggle purple_door_1
gotoobject green_box_1 room_1
pick green_box_1 room_1
gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1
drop green_box_1 room_2
gotoobject blue_ball_2 room_2
pick blue_ball_2 room_2
gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_3
toggle grey_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_3 grey_door_1
drop blue_ball_2 room_3
gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4
toggle green_door_1
gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_1
gotoobject red_ball_1 room_4
gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1
gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1
gotoobject grey_box_1 room_1
```

Checking the constraints:

1. `you are in front of blue_ball_2`: Satisfied in step 8.
2. `you are in room_3`: Satisfied in step 13 (after going to room_3).
3. `The following conditions are all true: "you are in front of red_ball_1", "you are in room_4"`: Satisfied in step 18.
4. `you are holding blue_ball_2`: Satisfied in steps 9-13.
5. `At least one of the following conditions is true: "you are in front of purple_box_1", "grey_door_1 is not locked"`: Satisfied in steps 12-21.
6. `blue_ball_2 is in room_3`: Satisfied in step 14 (after dropping blue_ball_2).
7. `green_box_1 is in room_2`: Satisfied in step 7 (after dropping green_box_1).
8. `The following conditions are all true: "you are holding some object", "you are in room_2"`: Satisfied in step 6.
9. `you are in front of empty`: Satisfied in step 1 (after executing "gotoempty").

And the goal:
`There is a box v such that "The following conditions are all true: "v is grey", "you are in front of v"""`: Satisfied in step 21 (be in front of grey_box_1).

So I think the plan above is valid and close to optimal if not optimal, though I've still got some unsurity about the "empty" constraint. But I'm pretty sure it works.

Actually, let me double check the consistency in my explanation.

1. Yes, I'm consistent with "you are in front of blue_ball_2": I go in front of blue_ball_2 in step 8.
2. Yes, I'm consistent with "you are in room_3": I go to room_3 in step 13 and stay there for steps 14-18.
3. Yes, I'm consistent with "you are in front of red_ball_1 and in room_4": I go to room_4 in step 17 and then immediately go in front of red_ball_1 in step 18.
4. Yes, I'm consistent with "you are holding blue_ball_2": I pick up blue_ball_2 in step 9 and hold it until I drop it in step 14.
5. Yes, I'm consistent with "you are in front of purple_box_1 or grey_door_1 is not locked": I unlock grey_door_1 in step 12.
6. Yes, I'm consistent with "blue_ball_2 is in room_3": I drop blue_ball_2 in room_3 in step 14.
7. Yes, I'm consistent with "green_box_1 is in room_2": I drop green_box_1 in room_2 in step 7.
8. Yes, I'm consistent with "you are holding some object (green_box_1) and are in room_2": I'm in room_2 with green_box_1 in step 6.
9. Yes, I'm consistent with "you are in front of empty": I go in front of an empty position in step 1.

And the goal: "There is a box v such that v is grey and you are in front of v": I end up in front of grey_box_1 in step 21.

I believe the plan is correct and valid:
