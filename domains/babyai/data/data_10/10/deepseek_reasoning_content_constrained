Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. Hmm, the goal is to be in front of a grey box, which must be grey_box_1 since that's the only grey box mentioned. The initial state has grey_box_1 in room_1. So the final goal is to be in front of grey_box_1 in room_1. But wait, the constraints complicate things. Let me list all the constraints first:

1. Must be in front of blue_ball_2 at some point.
2. Must be in room_3 at some state.
3. Must be in front of red_ball_1 in room_4 at some state.
4. Must hold blue_ball_2 at some point.
5. Either be in front of purple_box_1 or have grey_door_1 unlocked.
6. blue_ball_2 must be in room_3.
7. green_box_1 must be in room_2.
8. Holding an object while in room_2.
9. Be in front of empty at some point.

So the plan needs to achieve all these constraints while getting to the final goal. Let's start by figuring out the main steps.

First, the final goal is to be in front of grey_box_1 in room_1. Since grey_box_1 is initially in room_1, maybe we can just go to it, but perhaps there are obstacles. Wait, the initial state says the agent is in room_1. So if the agent is in room_1 and grey_box_1 is there, the action "gotoobject grey_box_1 room_1" would achieve the goal. But we need to satisfy all constraints first.

Constraints:

- Need to have blue_ball_2 in room_3. Blue_ball_2 starts in room_2. So we need to move it to room_3. But how? The agent must pick it up and carry it there. But doors are locked initially. Let's check the doors. The doors are purple_door_1 (connects room_1 and 2), grey_door_1 (connects 1 and 3), blue_door_1 (connects 2 and 4), green_door_1 (connects 3 and 4). All doors are locked. So to move between rooms, the agent needs to unlock doors. But to toggle a door, you need to be in front of it. And to get in front of a door, the path must not be blocked by an object. So, for example, to unlock grey_door_1 (connecting room_1 and 3), the agent is in room_1. Are there any objects blocking the door? The initial objects in room_1 are green_box_1 and grey_box_1. Are they blocking doors? The problem states that an object blocks a door if it's in front of it. So unless the boxes are in front of doors, they don't block. The initial state doesn't mention any blocking, so I assume doors are not blocked. So the agent can go to the doors.

So steps for moving from room_1 to room_2 via purple_door_1. But purple_door_1 is locked. So the agent needs to go to the door, toggle it (unlock), then go through. But to go to room_2 from room_1, the door is purple_door_1. Let's see.

Wait, initial position is room_1. Let's outline the possible movements:

From room_1, possible doors are purple_door_1 (to room_2) and grey_door_1 (to room_3). Both locked. So first, the agent needs to unlock these doors.

So first, in room_1:

1. Go to purple_door_1 (since it's in room_1). Action: gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2. But preconditions: must be in a room connected by the door. Yes, in room_1. Also, no object blocking the position in front of the door. Assuming that's true. Then toggle the door to unlock it. Then gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1. Then in room_2.

But let's also need to go to room_3 and room_4. Let's think about the constraints.

Constraint 2: must be in room_3. So the agent needs to go there. To get to room_3 from room_1, use grey_door_1. But it's locked. So need to unlock it. So in room_1, go to grey_door_1, toggle it (unlock), then go to room_3.

But perhaps there's a way to combine these steps.

Also, constraint 5: at some point, either in front of purple_box_1 (in room_4) or grey_door_1 is unlocked. Since we need to unlock grey_door_1 to get to room_3, that would satisfy the constraint. So unlocking grey_door_1 would handle constraint 5.

So steps so far:

1. In room_1, go to grey_door_1 (gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_3)
2. Toggle grey_door_1 (unlock it)
3. Go to room_3 via grey_door_1.

But why? Because we need to be in room_3 (constraint 2). Also, blue_ball_2 needs to be in room_3 (constraint 6). So maybe the agent needs to carry blue_ball_2 to room_3.

But blue_ball_2 is in room_2. So the agent needs to go to room_2 first. Let's think:

First, unlock purple_door_1 (from room_1 to room_2):

- In room_1: gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2
- toggle purple_door_1 (unlock)
- gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1 (now in room_2)

In room_2, there are blue_ball_1, blue_ball_2, yellow_box_1, green_ball_1. The agent needs to pick up blue_ball_2 (to fulfill holding it at some point). So:

- gotoobject blue_ball_2 room_2
- pick blue_ball_2 room_2 (now holding it, which satisfies constraint 4 and 8 (holding in room_2). Then, need to drop it in room_3. But to get to room_3, from room_2, the path is room_2 to room_1 via purple_door_1 (already unlocked), then room_1 to room_3 via grey_door_1 (unlocked earlier). Alternatively, room_2 to room_4 via blue_door_1 (locked), then room_4 to room_3 via green_door_1 (locked). But that's longer. So better to go through room_1 and room_3.

Wait, but after picking blue_ball_2 in room_2, the agent can go back to room_1 via purple_door_1 (already unlocked), then to room_3 via grey_door_1 (which was unlocked earlier). Then drop blue_ball_2 in room_3. But to drop, the agent needs to be in front of an empty position. So after entering room_3, gotoempty, then drop blue_ball_2. That would place blue_ball_2 in room_3, satisfying constraint 6.

But first, the agent must unlock grey_door_1. So the steps would be:

1. Unlock purple_door_1 (to get to room_2)
2. Go to room_2, pick blue_ball_2
3. Return to room_1, unlock grey_door_1
4. Go to room_3, drop blue_ball_2

But wait, let's sequence this properly.

Initial steps:

- Start in room_1.
- Need to unlock purple_door_1 to get to room_2.

So:

1. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2
2. toggle purple_door_1 (unlock)
3. gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1 (now in room_2)
4. gotoobject blue_ball_2 room_2
5. pick blue_ball_2 room_2 (now holding it, satisfies constraints 4 and 8)
6. Now, need to get to room_3. But to go to room_3 from room_2, the path is room_2 -> room_1 -> room_3. So back to room_1.

But the agent is in room_2. So:

6. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1 (since the agent is in room_2 now)
Wait, the gotodoor action requires the agent to be in a room connected by the door. So in room_2, purple_door_1 connects to room_1. So:

6. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1
7. gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1 (back to room_1)
8. Now, need to unlock grey_door_1 (room_1 to room_3). So:

8. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_3
9. toggle grey_door_1 (unlock)
10. gotoroom room_1 room_3 grey_door_1 (now in room_3, satisfying constraint 2)
11. Now, in room_3. Need to drop blue_ball_2 here. But first, the agent is holding it. To drop, need to be in front of an empty position.

11. gotoempty (in room_3)
12. drop blue_ball_2 room_3 (now blue_ball_2 is in room_3, satisfying constraint 6)

Now, constraint 3: be in front of red_ball_1 in room_4. red_ball_1 is in room_4. So the agent needs to go to room_4. How?

From room_3, the door to room_4 is green_door_1, which is locked. So need to unlock it. But to do that, the agent must be in front of green_door_1 in room_3.

But first, the agent is in room_3. Let's proceed:

13. gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4
14. toggle green_door_1 (unlock)
15. gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_1 (now in room_4)
16. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_4 (now in front of red_ball_1 in room_4, satisfying constraint 3)

But also, constraint 5: either be in front of purple_box_1 (which is in room_4) or have grey_door_1 unlocked. Since we already unlocked grey_door_1, that's satisfied. So that's covered.

Now, the agent is in room_4. What next? Need to get back to room_1 to handle the green_box_1 constraint (constraint 7: green_box_1 must be in room_2). green_box_1 is initially in room_1. So the agent needs to move it to room_2. How?

So, the agent is in room_4. To get back to room_1, the path could be room_4 -> room_3 via green_door_1 (already unlocked), then room_3 -> room_1 via grey_door_1 (unlocked). Then in room_1, pick up green_box_1 and take it to room_2.

But let's check:

From room_4:

17. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3
18. gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1 (back to room_3)
19. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1 (already unlocked)
20. gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1 (now in room_1)
21. Now, in room_1, need to pick green_box_1 and take it to room_2. So:

21. gotoobject green_box_1 room_1
22. pick green_box_1 room_1
23. Then, go to room_2 via purple_door_1 (unlocked)
24. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2
25. gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1 (now in room_2)
26. gotoempty (to drop the box)
27. drop green_box_1 room_2 (now green_box_1 is in room_2, satisfying constraint 7)

Now, the agent is in room_2 with green_box_1 placed. Next, need to get back to room_1 to handle the final goal (grey_box_1). Also, the constraint 9: be in front of empty. The agent has done that when dropping objects, like step 12 and 27. Let's confirm:

In step 12: after dropping blue_ball_2, the agent is in front of empty (since drop action leaves the agent in front of the object, but wait, the effect of drop is that you are in front of x. Wait, the effect of drop is: (i) you are no longer carrying x, (ii) you are in front of x, (iii) hands empty, (iv) x is in the current room. So when you drop, you end up in front of the object. So the agent is in front of the object, not empty. So when does the agent get in front of empty? For example, after using gotoempty. So step 11: gotoempty in room_3, then drop. So step 11 is gotoempty, which puts the agent in front of empty, satisfying constraint 9. Similarly, step 26 is gotoempty before dropping, so that would also satisfy constraint 9. So constraint 9 is handled.

Now, after step 27, the agent is in room_2. Need to get back to room_1 to reach grey_box_1. So:

28. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1
29. gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1 (now in room_1)
30. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_1 (now in front of grey_box_1, achieving the goal)

But let's check all constraints:

1. In front of blue_ball_2: step 4 (gotoobject blue_ball_2) satisfies this.
2. In room_3: step 10.
3. In front of red_ball_1 in room_4: step 16.
4. Holding blue_ball_2: step 5.
5. Either in front of purple_box_1 or grey_door_1 unlocked: grey_door_1 is unlocked (step 9), so satisfied.
6. blue_ball_2 in room_3: step 12.
7. green_box_1 in room_2: step 27.
8. Holding something in room_2: step 5 (holding blue_ball_2 in room_2).
9. In front of empty: step 11 (gotoempty).

All constraints are satisfied. Now, the plan steps:

But wait, let's check the order and see if all steps are necessary. Let's list the steps in order:

1. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2
2. toggle purple_door_1
3. gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1
4. gotoobject blue_ball_2 room_2
5. pick blue_ball_2 room_2
6. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1
7. gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1
8. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_3
9. toggle grey_door_1
10. gotoroom room_1 room_3 grey_door_1
11. gotoempty
12. drop blue_ball_2 room_3
13. gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4
14. toggle green_door_1
15. gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_1
16. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_4
17. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3
18. gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1
19. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1
20. gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1
21. gotoobject green_box_1 room_1
22. pick green_box_1 room_1
23. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2
24. gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1
25. gotoempty
26. drop green_box_1 room_2
27. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1
28. gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1
29. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_1

But wait, step 25: gotoempty in room_2 before dropping. That's necessary because the drop action requires being in front of an empty position. So when you drop, you have to be in front of an empty spot, but after dropping, you're in front of the object. So the sequence would be: gotoempty, then drop. So steps 25 and 26.

But maybe there's a way to optimize. Let's see:

After step 24 (in room_2), to drop green_box_1, need to be in front of an empty spot. So:

24. gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1 (now in room_2)
25. gotoempty (room_2)
26. drop green_box_1 room_2

Yes.

Now, let's count the steps. It's a bit long, but is there a shorter way?

Alternative approach: After moving blue_ball_2 to room_3, instead of going to room_4, maybe handle moving green_box_1 first. But the constraints require being in room_3, room_4, and having blue_ball_2 in room_3. So the steps as outlined are necessary.

Alternatively, after dropping blue_ball_2 in room_3, can the agent go back to room_1, pick green_box_1, take it to room_2, then proceed to room_4? Let's see:

After step 12 (blue_ball_2 in room_3):

13. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1
14. gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1 (back to room_1)
15. gotoobject green_box_1 room_1
16. pick green_box_1 room_1
17. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2
18. gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1 (now in room_2)
19. gotoempty
20. drop green_box_1 room_2 (now constraint 7 satisfied)
21. Then, need to get to room_4. From room_2, blue_door_1 connects to room_4. Blue_door_1 is locked. So need to unlock it.

So:

21. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_4
22. toggle blue_door_1 (unlock)
23. gotoroom room_2 room_4 blue_door_1 (now in room_4)
24. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_4 (constraint 3)
25. Then, perhaps return to room_3 via green_door_1 (unlock?), but maybe not needed. But after this, the agent is in room_4. To get back to room_1, need to go through room_2 or room_3.

But the final goal is to be in front of grey_box_1 in room_1. So after handling all constraints, the agent must return to room_1. So this alternative path might save steps.

But let's compare the two approaches. Original plan had 29 steps. Alternative might have fewer steps. Let's outline:

Original path steps (simplified):

1. Unlock purple_door_1
2. Pick blue_ball_2 in room_2
3. Return to room_1, unlock grey_door_1
4. Go to room_3, drop blue_ball_2
5. Unlock green_door_1, go to room_4, meet red_ball_1
6. Return to room_1 via room_3
7. Pick green_box_1, move to room_2, drop
8. Return to room_1, go to grey_box_1

Alternative path after step 12 (blue_ball_2 in room_3):

13. Return to room_1
14. Pick green_box_1
15. Move to room_2, drop
16. Unlock blue_door_1, go to room_4
17. Meet red_ball_1
18. Then return to room_1 via room_2 and purple_door_1
19. Go to grey_box_1

This might save steps by not needing to unlock green_door_1, but requires unlocking blue_door_1. But in the original plan, we had to unlock green_door_1 to get to room_4. In this alternative, unlocking blue_door_1 (from room_2 to room_4) could be another way.

But initially, blue_door_1 is locked and connects room_2 and room_4. So in the alternative path:

After step 20 (green_box_1 in room_2):

21. In room_2, need to unlock blue_door_1 to get to room_4.

So:

21. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_4
22. toggle blue_door_1 (unlock)
23. gotoroom room_2 room_4 blue_door_1 (now in room_4)
24. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_4 (satisfies constraint 3)
25. Then, to return to room_1, go back through blue_door_1 to room_2, then through purple_door_1 to room_1.

So steps:

25. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_4 room_2
26. gotoroom room_4 room_2 blue_door_1 (back to room_2)
27. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1
28. gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1 (now in room_1)
29. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_1

But this alternative path would have steps:

1. Unlock purple_door_1
2. Go to room_2, pick blue_ball_2
3. Return to room_1, unlock grey_door_1
4. Go to room_3, drop blue_ball_2
5. Return to room_1, pick green_box_1
6. Drop in room_2
7. Unlock blue_door_1, go to room_4, meet red_ball_1
8. Return to room_1, goto grey_box_1

This might be shorter. Let's count the steps:

Action sequence:

1. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2
2. toggle purple_door_1
3. gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1
4. gotoobject blue_ball_2 room_2
5. pick blue_ball_2 room_2
6. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1
7. gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1
8. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_3
9. toggle grey_door_1
10. gotoroom room_1 room_3 grey_door_1
11. gotoempty
12. drop blue_ball_2 room_3
13. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1
14. gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1
15. gotoobject green_box_1 room_1
16. pick green_box_1 room_1
17. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2
18. gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1
19. gotoempty
20. drop green_box_1 room_2
21. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_4
22. toggle blue_door_1
23. gotoroom room_2 room_4 blue_door_1
24. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_4
25. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_4 room_2
26. gotoroom room_4 room_2 blue_door_1
27. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1
28. gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1
29. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_1

This is still 29 steps. But in the original plan, there were steps to unlock green_door_1 and go through room_3 to room_4, which may not be necessary if using blue_door_1. However, both paths have similar lengths. Which one is shorter? Well, the alternative path uses blue_door_1, which requires unlocking, but avoids going through room_3 again after dropping blue_ball_2. However, in the original plan, after dropping blue_ball_2 in room_3, the agent proceeds to room_4 via green_door_1, which needs unlocking. Then returns via green_door_1 to room_3, then back to room_1. Whereas the alternative uses blue_door_1.

But in terms of steps, perhaps it's similar. Let's see which path has fewer steps.

Original plan steps after dropping blue_ball_2 in room_3:

13. gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4
14. toggle green_door_1
15. gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_1 (now in room_4)
16. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_4
17. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3
18. gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1 (back to room_3)
19. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1
20. gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1 (back to room_1)
21. gotoobject green_box_1 room_1
22. pick green_box_1 room_1
23. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2
24. gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1 (room_2)
25. gotoempty
26. drop green_box_1 room_2
27. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1
28. gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1 (room_1)
29. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_1

That's 17 steps after step 12. So total steps would be 12 + 17 = 29.

The alternative path after step 12:

Steps 13-29: 17 steps as well.

So both paths have the same number of steps. However, maybe there's a way to optimize further.

Wait, after dropping blue_ball_2 in room_3 (step 12), the agent needs to go to room_4 to satisfy constraint 3. In the original plan, the agent goes from room_3 to room_4 via green_door_1. In the alternative, the agent goes back to room_1, handles green_box_1, then goes to room_4 via blue_door_1. But in that case, the agent needs to unlock blue_door_1 (room_2 to room_4). Which would require being in room_2. So after moving green_box_1 to room_2, the agent is in room_2, then unlocks blue_door_1, goes to room_4. That's possible.

But the original plan's path may have more steps. Let's see:

Original plan after step 12 (room_3):

13. gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4 (room_3)
14. toggle green_door_1 (unlock)
15. gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_1 (room_4)
16. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_4 (constraint 3)
17. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3
18. gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1 (room_3)
19. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1
20. gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1 (room_1)
21. gotoobject green_box_1 room_1
22. pick green_box_1 room_1
23. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2
24. gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1 (room_2)
25. gotoempty
26. drop green_box_1 room_2
27. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1
28. gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1 (room_1)
29. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_1

Alternative path after step 12 (room_3):

13. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1
14. gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1 (room_1)
15. gotoobject green_box_1 room_1
16. pick green_box_1 room_1
17. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2
18. gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1 (room_2)
19. gotoempty
20. drop green_box_1 room_2 (now constraint 7)
21. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_4
22. toggle blue_door_1 (unlock)
23. gotoroom room_2 room_4 blue_door_1 (room_4)
24. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_4 (constraint 3)
25. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_4 room_2
26. gotoroom room_4 room_2 blue_door_1 (room_2)
27. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1
28. gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1 (room_1)
29. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_1

So both approaches have the same number of steps. However, perhaps there's a way to combine actions.

Another observation: when moving from room_1 to room_2 after picking green_box_1, the agent could directly go to room_2 and drop it. Then, from room_2, unlock blue_door_1, go to room_4, meet red_ball_1, return, and then proceed to the final goal.

Alternatively, after dropping green_box_1 in room_2 (step 20 in alternative), the agent is in room_2. Then, to get to room_4, they unlock blue_door_1 (step 21-23), go to room_4, meet red_ball_1, then return to room_2, then back to room_1.

This seems necessary. So the steps are unavoidable.

Is there a way to avoid toggling green_door_1 or blue_door_1? Let's see. To get to room_4 from room_2, blue_door_1 must be unlocked. From room_3, green_door_1 must be unlocked. Either way, one door needs to be unlocked. So no shortcut.

Thus, the plan seems to require 29 steps. But perhaps there's a shorter path.

Wait, the agent can carry multiple objects? No, the agent can only hold one object at a time. So when moving green_box_1, the agent must pick it up, move, then drop it.

Another thought: After dropping blue_ball_2 in room_3 (step 12), the agent is in room_3. Instead of going back to room_1 to pick green_box_1, can the agent go to room_4 via green_door_1 (unlock it), then in room_4, perhaps pick up purple_box_1 or red_ball_1? But constraint 5 requires either being in front of purple_box_1 or having grey_door_1 unlocked. Since grey_door_1 is unlocked, that's already satisfied. So no need to go to purple_box_1. But the agent must be in front of red_ball_1 in room_4. So the agent must go to room_4.

So maybe after step 12, the agent goes to room_4 via green_door_1, then returns to room_3, then to room_1, picks green_box_1, moves it to room_2, then back to room_1.

But this would still require steps similar to the original plan.

Hmm. I think the plan as initially outlined is necessary. It's quite lengthy, but I don't see a way to reduce the steps further. Let's make sure all constraints are met:

- In front of blue_ball_2: step 4 (gotoobject blue_ball_2)
- In room_3: step 10 (gotoroom to room_3)
- In front of red_ball_1 in room_4: step 16 (gotoobject red_ball_1)
- Holding blue_ball_2: step 5 (pick)
- Either front of purple_box_1 or grey_door_1 unlocked: grey_door_1 is unlocked (step 9)
- blue_ball_2 in room_3: step 12 (drop)
- green_box_1 in room_2: step 26 (drop)
- Holding object in room_2: step 5 (holding in room_2)
- In front of empty: step 11 (gotoempty)

All constraints are met. The final step is gotoobject grey_box_1 in room_1.

So the plan should be valid. Now, let's write it out in the required format.
