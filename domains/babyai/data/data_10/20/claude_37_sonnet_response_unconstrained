Alright, let's break down this problem:

We have 4 rooms arranged in a square formation:
- room_1 (north-west)
- room_2 (south-west)
- room_3 (north-east)
- room_4 (south-east)

There are 4 doors:
- blue_door_1 connects room_1 and room_2
- purple_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3
- green_door_1 connects room_2 and room_4
- green_door_2 connects room_3 and room_4

The world contains various objects: boxes, balls of different colors.

We're given the initial state:
- We're in room_3
- All the doors are locked
- Items are distributed in different rooms

Our goal is to:
- Find a door (d) that is blue, connects room_1 and room_2, and we need to be in front of it, and it should be unlocked.

Looking at the objects, the only blue door is `blue_door_1`, which connects room_1 and room_2. So our task is to:
1. Go to room_1 (which means we need to go through purple_door_1 from room_3)
2. Go in front of blue_door_1 in room_1
3. Toggle blue_door_1 to unlock it

Let's plan our actions:

1. First, we need to go in front of purple_door_1 in room_3.
   Action: `gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_1`

2. Toggle purple_door_1 to unlock it.
   Action: `toggle purple_door_1`

3. Go to room_1 from room_3 using purple_door_1.
   Action: `gotoroom room_3 room_1 purple_door_1`

4. Go in front of blue_door_1 in room_1.
   Action: `gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2`

5. Toggle blue_door_1 to unlock it.
   Action: `toggle blue_door_1`

However, let me double-check this plan against the preconditions and effects of each action to make sure it's valid.

For the action `gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_1`:
Preconditions:
- We're in a room that is connected by purple_door_1 (which is true, we're in room_3)
- No object is blocking the position in front of purple_door_1 in room_3 (the state doesn't mention any object blocking the door, so I assume this is met)

For the action `toggle purple_door_1`:
Preconditions:
- We're in front of purple_door_1 (which would be true after the first action)

For the action `gotoroom room_3 room_1 purple_door_1`:
Preconditions:
- We're in room_3 (which is true)
- room_3 is adjacent to room_1 via purple_door_1 (which is true)
- purple_door_1 is unlocked (which will be true after the toggle action)

For the action `gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2`:
Preconditions:
- We're in a room that is connected by blue_door_1 (which would be true after going to room_1)
- No object is blocking the position in front of blue_door_1 in room_1 (the state doesn't mention any object blocking the door, so I assume this is met)

For the action `toggle blue_door_1`:
Preconditions:
- We're in front of blue_door_1 (which would be true after the fourth action)

I believe all preconditions are satisfied for our planned actions. But let's continue to verify with effects.

After `gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_1`:
- We're in front of purple_door_1 (if we were in front of any other object or door in room_3, we no longer are)

After `toggle purple_door_1`:
- purple_door_1 becomes unlocked

After `gotoroom room_3 room_1 purple_door_1`:
- We're no longer in room_3
- We're now in room_1
- room_1 has been visited
- We're no longer in front of purple_door_1

After `gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2`:
- We're in front of blue_door_1

After `toggle blue_door_1`:
- blue_door_1 becomes unlocked

Our goal is to have a blue door (which blue_door_1 is) that connects room_1 and room_2 (which blue_door_1 does), and we need to be in front of it (which we are after the fourth action), and it should be unlocked (which it is after the fifth action).

So our plan meets the goal. But I want to double-check in case I've misunderstood anything.

The goal is: "There is a door d such that 'The following conditions are all true: "d is blue", "room_1 and room_2 are connected via d", "you are in front of d", "d is not locked"'"

We're trying to find a door d that:
1. Is blue
2. Connects room_1 and room_2
3. We are in front of it
4. It is not locked

blue_door_1 satisfies condition 1 (it's blue) and condition 2 (it connects room_1 and room_2).
After our plan, we satisfy condition 3 (we're in front of blue_door_1) and condition 4 (blue_door_1 is unlocked).

So, our plan should achieve the goal.

Let me list the final plan:

1. `gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_1`
2. `toggle purple_door_1`
3. `gotoroom room_3 room_1 purple_door_1`
4. `gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2`
5. `toggle blue_door_1`

Actually, I see a problem with my plan. The action `gotodoor` only takes a door and a room, not two rooms. Let me adjust the plan based on the given action description:

The actual signature is:
"gotodoor d r1 r2": Go in front of door d, connecting room r1 to room r2.

So, the corrected plan is:

1. `gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_1`
2. `toggle purple_door_1`
3. `gotoroom room_3 room_1 purple_door_1`
4. `gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2`
5. `toggle blue_door_1`

This seems correct based on the action descriptions provided.

Actually, I need to double-check something. My interpretation of the door-related actions is that:
- The action `gotodoor d r1 r2` is used to approach a door in a room. r1 is the current room, and r2 is the room on the other side of the door.
- The action `gotoroom r1 r2 d` is used to actually go through a door from room r1 to room r2 using door d.

Given this interpretation, let's again reconsider the plan:

1. `gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_1` - Go in front of purple_door_1 in room_3, which connects room_3 to room_1.
2. `toggle purple_door_1` - Unlock purple_door_1.
3. `gotoroom room_3 room_1 purple_door_1` - Go from room_3 to room_1 using purple_door_1.
4. `gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2` - Go in front of blue_door_1 in room_1, which connects room_1 to room_2.
5. `toggle blue_door_1` - Unlock blue_door_1.

Yes, this plan seems correct.

Let me actually recheck one more time.

We start in room_3.
We approach purple_door_1 in room_3.
We toggle (unlock) purple_door_1.
We go through purple_door_1 to room_1.
We approach blue_door_1 in room_1.
We toggle (unlock) blue_door_1.

After these actions, we are in room_1, in front of blue_door_1, which is now unlocked, and it connects room_1 and room_2. blue_door_1 is blue. So, all the conditions of the goal are met.

The final plan is:

1. `gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_1`
2. `toggle purple_door_1`
3. `gotoroom room_3 room_1 purple_door_1`
4. `gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2`
5. `toggle blue_door_1`

This plan is optimal, as it takes the most direct path from our starting position to achieve the goal. We need to go from room_3 to room_1, which we do by unlocking and going through purple_door_1. Then, we need to be in front of blue_door_1 in room_1 and have it unlocked, which we achieve with the last two actions.

So, the final optimal plan is:

```
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_1
toggle purple_door_1
gotoroom room_3 room_1 purple_door_1
gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2
toggle blue_door_1
```
