Okay, let's tackle this planning problem step by step. The goal is to get to a blue door that connects room_1 and room_2, be in front of it, and have it unlocked. The door in question is blue_door_1, which is initially locked. So the main steps would involve unlocking blue_door_1, getting to it, and ensuring all constraints are met along the way.

First, let's look at the initial state. The agent is in room_3. The blue_door_1 is locked and connects room_1 and room_2. To unlock it, the agent needs to toggle it, which requires being in front of it. But to get to blue_door_1, the agent needs to be in either room_1 or room_2. Since the agent starts in room_3, they need to navigate through the rooms.

Looking at the doors: room_3 is connected to room_1 via purple_door_1 (locked) and to room_4 via green_door_2 (locked). The constraints say that purple_door_1 must always stay locked, so that door can't be used. So the only way from room_3 is through green_door_2 to room_4. But green_door_2 is locked. To unlock it, the agent needs to toggle it, which requires being in front of it. But to get in front of green_door_2, the agent must be in room_3 or room_4. They are already in room_3. So maybe go to green_door_2, toggle it, then go to room_4.

Wait, but the agent starts in room_3. So first, "gotodoor green_door_2 room_3 room_4". But before that, they need to check if any object is blocking the position in front of green_door_2 in room_3. The initial objects in room_3 are purple_box_1 and grey_ball_1. If either is blocking the door, then the agent can't go to the door. The problem statement mentions that objects can block doors. So the preconditions for "gotodoor" require that there's no object blocking the position in front of the door in the current room. So if purple_box_1 or grey_ball_1 is in front of green_door_2 in room_3, the agent can't go there. But the initial state doesn't specify positions of objects relative to doors. Maybe the problem assumes that objects are not blocking doors unless stated. Since the problem doesn't mention any objects blocking doors initially, perhaps the agent can go to the door.

So first action: gotodoor green_door_2 room_3 room_4. Then toggle green_door_2 to unlock it. Then gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_2 to move to room_4.

Once in room_4, there's grey_box_1 and green_ball_1. The constraints require that at some point, "you are in room_1", but before that, the agent must have been in room_4 or in front of green_door_1. Since room_4 is connected to room_2 via green_door_1, which is locked. So maybe after reaching room_4, the agent can go to green_door_1, unlock it, go to room_2, then proceed to room_1 via blue_door_1 once it's unlocked.

But there's a constraint that when unlocking blue_door_1, the agent must have previously held purple_box_1 or have purple_ball_1 in room_3. Let's check the initial positions. Purple_ball_1 is in room_1. So to get purple_ball_1 to room_3, the agent would need to pick it up from room_1 and drop it there. But how to get to room_1? The agent is in room_3, but purple_door_1 is locked and can't be unlocked (since the constraint requires it to always be locked). So the only way to room_1 is through room_4, room_2, then room_1 via blue_door_1. Wait, but blue_door_1 is initially locked. So the agent needs to unlock blue_door_1. But to unlock it, the agent needs to be in front of it. To get in front of blue_door_1, the agent needs to be in room_1 or room_2. Let's think: if the agent is in room_2, they can go to blue_door_1 (since it connects room_1 and room_2). Then toggle it to unlock. But how to get to room_2? From room_4 via green_door_1. So the steps would be:

1. Unlock green_door_2 to get to room_4.
2. Then unlock green_door_1 to get to room_2.
3. From room_2, unlock blue_door_1 to get to room_1.

But let's check the constraints. One constraint says that if the agent is in room_1, there must have been an earlier state where they were in room_4 or in front of green_door_1. So if the agent goes from room_3 to room_4 (via green_door_2), then to room_2 (via green_door_1), then to room_1 (via blue_door_1), then when in room_1, their path included being in room_4, which satisfies that constraint.

Another constraint is that when the agent is in front of blue_door_1, there must have been a prior state where purple_box_1 is in room_4. The initial position of purple_box_1 is room_3. So the agent needs to move purple_box_1 to room_4. How? Since the agent starts in room_3, they can pick up purple_box_1, carry it to room_4 via green_door_2 (after unlocking it), then drop it there.

So steps:

- From room_3, go to purple_box_1 (gotoobject purple_box_1 room_3)
- pick it up (pick purple_box_1 room_3)
- go to green_door_2 (gotodoor green_door_2 room_3 room_4)
- toggle green_door_2 (unlock)
- gotoroom to room_4
- drop purple_box_1 in room_4 (but to drop, they need to be in front of an empty position. So after entering room_4, they need to gotoempty, then drop.

Wait, when the agent enters room_4 via gotoroom, they are no longer in front of any door. So after entering room_4, they can gotoempty, then drop purple_box_1. Then purple_box_1 is in room_4, satisfying the requirement for the blue_door_1 constraint.

But then, after dropping, they can proceed to unlock green_door_1. To do that, they need to go to green_door_1 from room_4. So gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2. Toggle it (unlock), then gotoroom to room_2. Now in room_2, they can go to blue_door_1 (gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1). Then toggle it to unlock. Now blue_door_1 is unlocked. Then the agent can go to room_1 via blue_door_1. But the goal is to be in front of blue_door_1 when it's unlocked, not necessarily to enter room_1. Wait, the goal is "you are in front of d" where d is blue_door_1, which is unlocked. So after unlocking blue_door_1, the agent is in front of it (since they just toggled it), so that would satisfy the goal. But wait, the toggle action requires being in front of the door. So after gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1, toggle blue_door_1 (unlocking it). Then the agent is in front of blue_door_1, which is now unlocked. That would satisfy the goal: d is blue, connects room_1 and room_2, agent is in front of it, and it's not locked. So that's the goal state.

But we need to ensure all constraints are met. Let's check each one:

1. purple_door_1 must remain locked. The agent never interacts with it, so it stays locked. Good.

2. green_door_1 must be unlocked at least once. When the agent toggles green_door_1, it becomes unlocked. So that's covered.

3. Must be in room_1 at least once. Wait, the goal doesn't require being in room_1, but the constraints require that the agent is in room_1 in some state. So after unlocking blue_door_1, the agent can go to room_1 using blue_door_1. But that would be an extra step. Alternatively, perhaps the agent doesn't need to enter room_1. Wait, the constraint says "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'you are in room_1'". So even if the goal is achieved without entering room_1, the agent must still visit room_1 at some point. So after unlocking blue_door_1, the agent can go to room_1 via blue_door_1, thus satisfying that constraint.

But how to get to room_1? From room_2, after unlocking blue_door_1, they can gotoroom room_2 room_1 blue_door_1. But that requires being in room_2. So after unlocking blue_door_1, the agent is in front of it in room_2. To enter room_1, they need to use gotoroom room_2 room_1 blue_door_1. Then they are in room_1, satisfying the constraint. But that's an extra step. However, the problem says the plan must be optimal, so we need the shortest possible.

Wait, but the constraint is that "you are in room_1" must hold in at least one state. If the agent is never in room_1, the constraint is violated. So they need to visit room_1. So after unlocking blue_door_1, the agent must enter room_1. But the goal is just to be in front of blue_door_1 (which is in room_2's perspective). So maybe after unlocking blue_door_1, the agent is in front of it in room_2. Then, to enter room_1, they can use gotoroom. That would satisfy the "you are in room_1" constraint. But that's an additional action. So perhaps the plan requires that.

Another constraint: if the agent is in room_1, they must have previously been in room_4 or in front of green_door_1. Since the agent went from room_3 to room_4, then to room_2, then to room_1, their path includes room_4, so that's satisfied.

Another constraint: must be in front of purple_door_1 at least once. Purple_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3. The agent is starting in room_3, but to get in front of purple_door_1, they need to be in room_1 or room_3. But since they can't go through purple_door_1 (it's locked and must stay locked), how to get in front of it? From room_3, they can goto purple_door_1. But the initial state says purple_door_1 is locked. But the preconditions for gotodoor are that the agent is in a room connected by the door and no object is blocking. Assuming the agent can go to purple_door_1 from room_3, but since they can't unlock it, but the constraint is that they must be in front of purple_door_1 at least once. So they can go to purple_door_1 in room_3, which is allowed. But the constraint for being in front of purple_door_1 requires that before that, the agent either holds grey_box_1 or yellow_box_1 is in room_4. Initially, yellow_box_1 is in room_2. So the agent must either have grey_box_1 (which is in room_4) or move yellow_box_1 to room_4. Since grey_box_1 is in room_4, if the agent is holding it before going to purple_door_1, that would satisfy the condition. Alternatively, moving yellow_box_1 to room_4. But moving yellow_box_1 from room_2 to room_4 would require going through room_2, green_door_1 to room_4, which may be possible.

Wait, the agent needs to be in front of purple_door_1 at some point. Let's say they do that early in the plan. For example, from room_3, goto purple_door_1. But to do that, they need to have either held grey_box_1 or have yellow_box_1 in room_4. Since initially, grey_box_1 is in room_4 and yellow_box_1 is in room_2, but the agent hasn't picked up grey_box_1 yet. So if the agent first goes to room_4, picks up grey_box_1, then returns to room_3, then goes to purple_door_1, that would satisfy the condition. But that adds more steps.

Alternatively, move yellow_box_1 to room_4. But that requires getting to room_2, which needs green_door_1 unlocked. So the agent would have to unlock green_door_1, go to room_2, pick up yellow_box_1, take it to room_4. But that's a lot of steps. So perhaps it's easier to pick up grey_box_1 in room_4. Let's see.

But the agent's initial path is from room_3 to room_4 via green_door_2. Once in room_4, they can pick up grey_box_1. Then when they go back to room_3 (if needed), they can be holding grey_box_1, then go to purple_door_1. But why would they need to go back to room_3? Because to get in front of purple_door_1, they can be in room_3. So after getting grey_box_1, they can go back to room_3 via green_door_2, then goto purple_door_1. But that would require toggling green_door_2 again (since after the first time, it's unlocked, but after going back, they can pass through). Wait, after unlocking green_door_2, it's unlocked. So to return from room_4 to room_3, they can use green_door_2 again.

But the agent's plan would be:

1. In room_3: gotodoor green_door_2 room_3 room_4
2. toggle green_door_2 (unlocks it)
3. gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_2 (now in room_4)
4. pick grey_box_1 in room_4 (need to gotoobject first, then pick)
   - gotoobject grey_box_1 room_4
   - pick grey_box_1 room_4
5. Now holding grey_box_1, go back to room_3
   - gotodoor green_door_2 room_4 room_3
   - gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_2
6. Now in room_3, holding grey_box_1. Then goto purple_door_1 in room_3.
   - gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_1
7. Now in front of purple_door_1, satisfying the constraint that they were holding grey_box_1 before.

But this adds several steps. However, the constraint is that if they are in front of purple_door_1, they must have previously held grey_box_1 or yellow_box_1 is in room_4. If the agent does step 4 (picks grey_box_1), then step 6, that satisfies the condition because they are holding grey_box_1 in an earlier state. But wait, the constraint says "if you are in front of purple_door_1 in some state, then there must be an earlier state where you were holding grey_box_1 or yellow_box_1 is in room_4". So as long as before step 6, either condition is met. So if the agent picks up grey_box_1 in room_4, then goes back to room_3 and goes to purple_door_1, that's okay. But this would require steps to pick and carry grey_box_1.

But maybe there's a more efficient way. Alternatively, the agent could move yellow_box_1 to room_4. But that requires going to room_2, which needs green_door_1 unlocked. Let's see:

After unlocking green_door_2 and going to room_4, the agent can go to green_door_1 (in room_4), toggle it to unlock, then go to room_2. In room_2, pick yellow_box_1, take it to room_4. Then, when yellow_box_1 is in room_4, the agent can go to purple_door_1 in room_3, satisfying the condition. But this is a longer path.

Comparing the two options, picking up grey_box_1 seems shorter. So steps would include:

- Unlock green_door_2
- Go to room_4, pick grey_box_1
- Return to room_3, go to purple_door_1 (satisfying the constraint)
- Then proceed to unlock other doors.

But this adds steps. However, it's necessary to fulfill the constraint about being in front of purple_door_1.

Another constraint: "blue_box_1 is in room_3" must hold in at least one state. Initially, blue_box_1 is in room_1. So the agent needs to move it to room_3. But how? The agent is in room_3 initially. To get to room_1, they need to go through room_4, room_2, then room_1 via blue_door_1 (once it's unlocked). Then pick up blue_box_1, carry it back to room_3. But that's a lot of steps. However, this is a required constraint.

So the agent must move blue_box_1 from room_1 to room_3. Let's see:

After unlocking blue_door_1, the agent can go to room_1, pick up blue_box_1, carry it back through blue_door_1 to room_2, then through green_door_1 to room_4, then through green_door_2 to room_3, and drop it there. But this is a long path. Alternatively, after unlocking blue_door_1, maybe there's a shorter path. But let's think:

Once blue_door_1 is unlocked, the agent can move between room_1 and room_2. To get blue_box_1 to room_3, the agent would need to carry it through room_2, room_4, then room_3 via green_door_2. But room_4 is connected to room_3 via green_door_2 (which is unlocked). So steps would be:

- After unlocking blue_door_1, go to room_1 via blue_door_1.
- Pick up blue_box_1.
- Return to room_2.
- Go through green_door_1 to room_4.
- Go through green_door_2 to room_3.
- Drop blue_box_1.

But this adds several steps, which may not be optimal. However, the constraint requires that blue_box_1 is in room_3 at least once, so this is necessary.

Another constraint: "If blue_door_1 is not locked, then previously the agent held purple_box_1 or purple_ball_1 is in room_3." The initial state has purple_ball_1 in room_1. So unless the agent moves it to room_3, they must have held purple_box_1 before unlocking blue_door_1. Purple_box_1 is in room_3 initially. So if the agent picks up purple_box_1 in room_3, carries it to room_4 (as part of moving to room_4), then when they unlock blue_door_1, they have previously held purple_box_1, which satisfies the constraint.

So here's a possible plan outline:

1. In room_3, goto purple_box_1.
2. Pick purple_box_1.
3. Gotodoor green_door_2.
4. Toggle green_door_2 (unlock).
5. Gotoroom to room_4.
6. Drop purple_box_1 (so it's in room_4, satisfying the constraint for blue_door_1's unlock condition).
7. Now, purple_box_1 is in room_4. The agent is in room_4, empty-handed.
8. Gotodoor green_door_1 in room_4.
9. Toggle green_door_1 (unlock).
10. Gotoroom to room_2.
11. Gotodoor blue_door_1 in room_2.
12. Toggle blue_door_1 (unlock) → now blue_door_1 is unlocked.
13. At this point, the agent is in front of blue_door_1, which is blue, connects room_1 and 2, and is unlocked. So goal is achieved. But need to check other constraints.

But wait, after step 12, the agent is in front of blue_door_1 in room_2. The goal requires that the agent is in front of d (blue_door_1) and d is not locked. That's satisfied. So that's the goal state. But let's check other constraints.

Constraints:

- Must be in room_1 at least once. So after step 12, the agent can goto room_1 via blue_door_1. But that's an extra step. However, the constraint requires being in room_1 at least once. So step 13: gotoroom room_2 room_1 blue_door_1. Now in room_1.

- The constraint about being in room_1: when the agent is in room_1, they must have been in room_4 or in front of green_door_1 before. Since the agent was in room_4 (step 5), that's satisfied.

- The constraint about being in front of purple_door_1: need to include that. So earlier steps must include going to purple_door_1. For example, before leaving room_3 initially, the agent could go to purple_door_1. But they need to have either held grey_box_1 or yellow_box_1 in room_4. Since the agent has purple_box_1 in room_4 (from step 6), not grey_box_1. Wait, the constraint says "you are holding grey_box_1" or "yellow_box_1 is in room_4". So if the agent hasn't picked grey_box_1, and yellow_box_1 is still in room_2, then when they go to purple_door_1, this condition isn't met. So the agent must have either held grey_box_1 or moved yellow_box_1 to room_4 before going to purple_door_1.

But in the current plan outline, the agent hasn't interacted with grey_box_1 or yellow_box_1. So if the agent needs to go to purple_door_1, they must arrange for one of those conditions. Let's say they go to purple_door_1 after dropping purple_box_1 in room_4. Wait, but how? The agent is in room_4. To get to purple_door_1 in room_3, they need to go back to room_3. But they can do that via green_door_2, which is unlocked. So steps after step 6:

6.5: gotodoor green_door_2 in room_4.
6.6: gotoroom to room_3.
6.7: goto purple_door_1 in room_3.

But before step 6.7, the agent needs to have either held grey_box_1 or yellow_box_1 in room_4. Since grey_box_1 is in room_4, but the agent hasn't picked it up. So the condition isn't met. So to satisfy the constraint, the agent needs to either pick up grey_box_1 or move yellow_box_1 to room_4. Moving yellow_box_1 would require going to room_2, which is possible after unlocking green_door_1. So let's adjust the plan:

After step 10 (in room_2):

10.5: gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_2
10.6: pick yellow_box_1 room_2
10.7: gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4
10.8: gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1
10.9: drop yellow_box_1 room_4 (after gotoempty)
10.10: Now yellow_box_1 is in room_4. Then proceed to step 11.

Then, after moving to room_3 (step 6.6), when they go to purple_door_1, the condition is met because yellow_box_1 is in room_4. But this adds a lot of steps. Alternatively, pick up grey_box_1 in room_4 before returning to room_3. Let's see:

After step 5 (in room_4):

5.5: gotoobject grey_box_1 room_4
5.6: pick grey_box_1 room_4
5.7: drop grey_box_1 room_4 (but why?) No, the agent needs to hold it when they go to purple_door_1. So after picking grey_box_1, carry it back to room_3:

5.7: gotodoor green_door_2 room_4 room_3
5.8: gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_2
5.9: goto purple_door_1 room_3 room_1 → now in front of purple_door_1, while holding grey_box_1. Then drop it if needed.

But this adds steps. Let's see:

Original plan steps with additions for purple_door_1:

1. gotoobject purple_box_1 room_3
2. pick purple_box_1 room_3
3. gotodoor green_door_2 room_3 room_4
4. toggle green_door_2
5. gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_2
6. gotoempty room_4
7. drop purple_box_1 room_4
8. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_4
9. pick grey_box_1 room_4
10. gotodoor green_door_2 room_4 room_3
11. toggle green_door_2 (already unlocked, so toggling would lock it. Wait, no. The initial toggle in step 4 unlocks it. Then step 10 uses it to go back. Toggling again would lock it. But the constraint for green_door_2 is only that green_door_1 must be unlocked at least once, which is handled later. However, the agent needs to go back to room_3. So step 10: gotodoor green_door_2 room_4 room_3. Then step 11: gotoroom to room_3. Now in room_3, holding grey_box_1.

12. goto purple_door_1 room_3 room_1 (gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_1)
13. Now in front of purple_door_1, and since the agent is holding grey_box_1, the constraint is satisfied.

14. Then proceed to unlock green_door_1 and blue_door_1.

But this is getting very complicated. Let's try to organize this into a coherent plan.

Here's a tentative step-by-step plan:

1. gotoobject purple_box_1 room_3
2. pick purple_box_1 room_3
3. gotodoor green_door_2 room_3 room_4
4. toggle green_door_2 (unlocks it)
5. gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_2 (now in room_4)
6. gotoempty room_4
7. drop purple_box_1 room_4 (now purple_box_1 is in room_4, satisfying the blue_door_1 unlock condition)
8. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_4
9. pick grey_box_1 room_4
10. gotodoor green_door_2 room_4 room_3
11. gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_2 (back to room_3)
12. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_1 (now in front of purple_door_1, holding grey_box_1 → satisfies constraint)
13. drop grey_box_1 room_3 (if needed, but not necessary)
14. Now, need to unlock green_door_1 to get to room_2. But to get to room_4 again:

15. gotodoor green_door_2 room_3 room_4
16. toggle green_door_2 (was unlocked, now toggling locks it again. But we need to keep it unlocked? Wait, the constraint doesn't require green_door_2 to stay unlocked. But after step 4, it's unlocked. Step 16 would lock it again, but the agent needs to go back to room_4. So perhaps after step 11, when the agent is in room_3, they can go to room_4 again via green_door_2, which is already unlocked. Wait, after step 11, the agent is in room_3 again. To go back to room_4, they need to go through green_door_2 again. But after step 4, green_door_2 is unlocked. So step 15: gotodoor green_door_2 room_3 room_4 (assuming no object is blocking)
17. toggle green_door_2 (but it's already unlocked; toggling would lock it. Wait, no: step 4 was toggle, which unlocked it. So step 15, the agent is in room_3, goes to green_door_2 again, which is unlocked. They don't need to toggle it again to pass through. So gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_2 again. But after step 11, they are in room_3. So:

15. gotodoor green_door_2 room_3 room_4
16. gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_2 (now in room_4 again)
17. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2
18. toggle green_door_1 (unlocks it)
19. gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_1 (now in room_2)
20. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1
21. toggle blue_door_1 (unlocks it → now blue_door_1 is unlocked, and agent is in front of it. Goal achieved.)
22. Now, need to satisfy being in room_1. So:
23. gotoroom room_2 room_1 blue_door_1 (now in room_1 → satisfies constraint)
24. Also, need to move blue_box_1 to room_3. So from room_1:
25. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1
26. pick blue_box_1 room_1
27. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2
28. gotoroom room_1 room_2 blue_door_1 (back to room_2)
29. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4
30. gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1 (room_4)
31. gotodoor green_door_2 room_4 room_3
32. gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_2 (room_3)
33. gotoempty room_3
34. drop blue_box_1 room_3 → now blue_box_1 is in room_3, satisfying the constraint.

This is a very long plan, but let's check if all constraints are met:

- purple_door_1 remains locked. Correct, as the agent never toggles it.
- green_door_1 is unlocked in step 18.
- agent is in room_1 in step 23.
- before being in room_1 (step 23), agent was in room_4 (step 16), satisfying the constraint.
- agent is in front of purple_door_1 in step 12, and before that, held grey_box_1 (step 9), satisfying that constraint.
- agent is in front of blue_door_1 in step 21.
- before step 21, purple_box_1 was moved to room_4 (step 7), satisfying the constraint for blue_door_1's unlock.
- the constraint "you are in room_2 or holding an object" is satisfied multiple times (e.g., step 9, holding grey_box_1).
- blue_box_1 is in room_3 after step 34.
- blue_door_1 is unlocked in step 21.
- the constraint for blue_door_1 unlock: agent held purple_box_1 (steps 1-2) before step 21.
- the constraint "in front of yellow_box_1 or green_door_2 unlocked": green_door_2 was unlocked in step 4, so this holds in step 4 onward.
- the constraint "grey_ball_1 in room_4 and green_door_1 unlocked": grey_ball_1 is initially in room_3. Need to move it to room_4. But in the current plan, grey_ball_1 remains in room_3. Oops, that's a problem. So the final constraint is that in some state, grey_ball_1 is in room_4 and green_door_1 is unlocked. So the agent needs to move grey_ball_1 to room_4.

This adds even more steps. For example, after step 34 (blue_box_1 in room_3), the agent is in room_3. They can:

35. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_3
36. pick grey_ball_1 room_3
37. gotodoor green_door_2 room_3 room_4
38. toggle green_door_2 (unlock again if needed)
39. gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_2
40. drop grey_ball_1 room_4
41. Now, grey_ball_1 is in room_4. And green_door_1 was unlocked in step 18. So in the state after step 40, both conditions are met.

This is getting extremely long, which contradicts the requirement for an optimal (shortest) plan. So perhaps there's a more efficient way.

Alternative approach: Focus on the main goal and necessary constraints, trying to combine steps.

Let me try to outline a more efficient plan:

1. Start in room_3. Pick up purple_box_1.
2. Unlock green_door_2 and go to room_4.
3. Drop purple_box_1 in room_4 (satisfies the condition for blue_door_1's unlock).
4. Go back to room_3 via green_door_2.
5. Go to purple_door_1 (satisfies the constraint because purple_box_1 was held earlier).
6. Unlock green_door_2 again (if needed) to go back to room_4.
7. Unlock green_door_1 and go to room_2.
8. Unlock blue_door_1 (now satisfies the goal).
9. Go to room_1 to satisfy the room_1 constraint.
10. Move blue_box_1 to room_3 via room_2, room_4.
11. Move grey_ball_1 to room_4.

But this is still complex. Let's see step count.

Detailed steps:

1. gotoobject purple_box_1 room_3
2. pick purple_box_1 room_3
3. gotodoor green_door_2 room_3 room_4
4. toggle green_door_2 (unlock)
5. gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_2 (now in room_4)
6. gotoempty room_4
7. drop purple_box_1 room_4 (purple_box_1 in room_4)
8. gotodoor green_door_2 room_4 room_3
9. gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_2 (back to room_3)
10. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_1 (now in front of it, satisfies constraint)
11. gotodoor green_door_2 room_3 room_4
12. toggle green_door_2 (unlocks if needed; but already unlocked)
13. gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_2 (room_4)
14. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2
15. toggle green_door_1 (unlock)
16. gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_1 (room_2)
17. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1
18. toggle blue_door_1 (unlock → goal achieved)
19. gotoroom room_2 room_1 blue_door_1 (room_1)
20. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1
21. pick blue_box_1 room_1
22. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2
23. gotoroom room_1 room_2 blue_door_1 (room_2)
24. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4
25. gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1 (room_4)
26. gotodoor green_door_2 room_4 room_3
27. gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_2 (room_3)
28. gotoempty room_3
29. drop blue_box_1 room_3 (blue_box_1 in room_3)
30. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_3
31. pick grey_ball_1 room_3
32. gotodoor green_door_2 room_3 room_4
33. gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_2 (room_4)
34. gotoempty room_4
35. drop grey_ball_1 room_4 (now grey_ball_1 in room_4)
36. Now, in room_4, green_door_1 is unlocked (step15), so the constraint "grey_ball_1 in room_4 and green_door_1 not locked" is met.

This is 36 steps, which is far from optimal. The user requested an optimal plan with the shortest possible steps. Clearly, this approach is not optimal. So I must find a way to minimize steps while fulfilling all constraints.

Let's reevaluate the constraints to see which can be satisfied with minimal steps.

Constraints:

1. purple_door_1 must always be locked. → Never toggle it.

2. green_door_1 must be unlocked at least once. → Need to toggle it once.

3. Agent must be in room_1 at least once. → Visit room_1.

4. When in room_1, earlier state in room_4 or in front of green_door_1. → Path through room_4.

5. In front of purple_door_1 at least once. → Must visit it once.

6. When in front of purple_door_1, earlier state holding grey_box_1 or yellow_box_1 in room_4.

7. In front of blue_door_1 at least once. → Unlocking it.

8. When in front of blue_door_1, earlier state purple_box_1 in room_4.

9. At least once in room_2 or holding an object. → Holding objects during transport.

10. blue_box_1 in room_3 at least once. → Move it from room_1.

11. blue_door_1 unlocked at least once. → Toggle it.

12. When blue_door_1 is unlocked, earlier state holding purple_box_1 or purple_ball_1 in room_3.

13. At least once in front of yellow_box_1 or green_door_2 unlocked. → green_door_2 is unlocked during the plan.

14. At least once grey_ball_1 in room_4 and green_door_1 unlocked.

So the plan must address all these.

Perhaps the most efficient way is:

- Move purple_box_1 to room_4 (to satisfy blue_door_1 unlock condition).

- Unlock green_door_2, go to room_4.

- Unlock green_door_1, go to room_2.

- Unlock blue_door_1 (after ensuring purple_box_1 is in room_4).

- Visit room_1.

- Move blue_box_1 to room_3.

- Move grey_ball_1 to room_4.

- Ensure purple_door_1 is visited after holding grey_box_1.

But how to integrate all these steps optimally.

Alternative plan:

1. In room_3, goto purple_box_1 and pick it.

2. Go to green_door_2, unlock it, go to room_4.

3. Drop purple_box_1 in room_4.

4. Pick grey_box_1 in room_4.

5. Return to room_3 via green_door_2.

6. Goto purple_door_1 (now holding grey_box_1, satisfies constraint).

7. Drop grey_box_1.

8. Go back to room_4 via green_door_2.

9. Unlock green_door_1, go to room_2.

10. Goto blue_door_1, unlock it (now in front of blue_door_1, unlocked → goal met).

11. Go to room_1 (satisfy constraint).

12. Pick blue_box_1, carry it back to room_3 via room_2, room_4, room_3.

13. While in room_4, pick grey_ball_1 (wait, grey_ball_1 is in room_3 initially. Need to move it to room_4).

Wait, grey_ball_1 is in room_3 initially. So to satisfy the constraint, the agent must move it to room_4 while green_door_1 is unlocked.

So steps after step 11:

13. Return to room_2 via blue_door_1.

14. Go to room_4 via green_door_1.

15. Go to room_3 via green_door_2.

16. Pick grey_ball_1 in room_3.

17. Go to room_4 via green_door_2.

18. Drop grey_ball_1 in room_4.

Now, green_door_1 is unlocked (from step 9), and grey_ball_1 is in room_4 → satisfies constraint.

This is still many steps. Let's count:

1. gotoobject purple_box_1 room_3

2. pick purple_box_1 room_3

3. gotodoor green_door_2 room_3 room_4

4. toggle green_door_2

5. gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_2

6. drop purple_box_1 room_4

7. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_4

8. pick grey_box_1 room_4

9. gotodoor green_door_2 room_4 room_3

10. gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_2

11. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_1

12. drop grey_box_1 room_3 (optional, but not needed)

13. gotodoor green_door_2 room_3 room_4

14. gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_2

15. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2

16. toggle green_door_1

17. gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_1

18. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1

19. toggle blue_door_1 (goal met)

20. gotoroom room_2 room_1 blue_door_1 (room_1)

21. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1

22. pick blue_box_1 room_1

23. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2

24. gotoroom room_1 room_2 blue_door_1

25. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4

26. gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1

27. gotodoor green_door_2 room_4 room_3

28. gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_2

29. drop blue_box_1 room_3

30. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_3

31. pick grey_ball_1 room_3

32. gotodoor green_door_2 room_3 room_4

33. gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_2

34. drop grey_ball_1 room_4

This is 34 steps. Still too long. 

Perhaps there's a way to combine steps. For example, when moving purple_box_1 to room_4, the agent can pick grey_box_1 in the same trip. But need to drop purple_box_1 first.

Another observation: The constraint about grey_ball_1 in room_4 and green_door_1 unlocked can be satisfied during the same trip when the agent is in room_4 after unlocking green_door_1. So after step 26 (room_4), the agent can pick grey_ball_1 from room_3 and drop it in room_4. But grey_ball_1 is in room_3. So after step 28 (back in room_3), the agent can pick grey_ball_1 and carry it to room_4.

But this adds steps. 

Alternatively, after step 34 (drop grey_ball_1 in room_4), the agent is in room_4, green_door_1 is unlocked (from step 16), so that state satisfies the constraint.

But this requires moving grey_ball_1, which is in room_3. So steps 30-34 are needed.

This is getting too complicated. The optimal plan must be shorter. Let's think differently.

Maybe the agent can use the fact that green_door_2 is unlocked early on to move between room_3 and room_4 multiple times without toggling again. Also, perhaps some constraints can be satisfied in overlapping steps.

Alternative plan focusing on key steps:

1. Pick purple_box_1 in room_3.

2. Unlock green_door_2, go to room_4.

3. Drop purple_box_1 in room_4 (satisfies blue_door_1's unlock condition).

4. Return to room_3, goto purple_door_1 (needs to have held grey_box_1 or have yellow_box_1 in room_4. Since the agent hasn't picked grey_box_1, but purple_box_1 is in room_4. Wait, the condition is either holding grey_box_1 or yellow_box_1 in room_4. Purple_box_1 in room_4 doesn't help. So the agent must either carry grey_box_1 or move yellow_box_1.

But in this case, since purple_box_1 is in room_4, that doesn't satisfy the condition. So the agent must pick grey_box_1 in room_4 and carry it back to room_3 to satisfy the condition when going to purple_door_1.

So steps after 3:

4. Pick grey_box_1 in room_4.

5. Return to room_3.

6. Goto purple_door_1 (now holding grey_box_1).

7. Drop grey_box_1 in room_3 (optional).

8. Proceed to unlock green_door_1 and blue_door_1.

But how to move blue_box_1 to room_3.

This is still many steps. Let's try to outline:

1. gotoobject purple_box_1 room_3

2. pick purple_box_1

3. gotodoor green_door_2 room_3 room_4

4. toggle green_door_2

5. gotoroom to room_4

6. drop purple_box_1

7. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_4

8. pick grey_box_1

9. gotodoor green_door_2 room_4 room_3

10. gotoroom to room_3

11. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_1 (now in front of it, holding grey_box_1 → satisfies constraint)

12. drop grey_box_1 room_3 (optional)

13. gotodoor green_door_2 room_3 room_4

14. gotoroom to room_4

15. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2

16. toggle green_door_1

17. gotoroom to room_2

18. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1

19. toggle blue_door_1 (unlocks it → goal met)

20. gotoroom to room_1 (satisfies room_1 constraint)

21. pick blue_box_1 room_1

22. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2

23. gotoroom to room_2

24. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4

25. gotoroom to room_4

26. gotodoor green_door_2 room_4 room_3

27. gotoroom to room_3

28. drop blue_box_1 (now in room_3)

29. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_3

30. pick grey_ball_1

31. gotodoor green_door_2 room_3 room_4

32. gotoroom to room_4

33. drop grey_ball_1 (now in room_4 with green_door_1 unlocked → satisfies constraint)

This is 33 steps. Still too long. The key constraints that require many steps are moving blue_box_1 and grey_ball_1. Maybe there's a way to combine these steps.

Another observation: When the agent is in room_4 after step 25, they can pick grey_box_1 again and carry it to room_3 when moving blue_box_1. But this may not help.

Alternatively, after step 33, the agent has dropped grey_ball_1 in room_4. So in that state, green_door_1 is unlocked (step 16), and grey_ball_1 is in room_4. So that satisfies the last constraint.

But this requires steps 29-33.

This seems unavoidable. However, the user insists on an optimal plan. Maybe there's a smarter way.

Wait, the agent needs to have blue_box_1 in room_3 at some point. Let's see if moving blue_box_1 can be combined with other steps.

After unlocking blue_door_1 (step 19), the agent is in room_2. To get to room_1, they can go through blue_door_1, pick blue_box_1, and return to room_2, then go through green_door_1 to room_4, then through green_door_2 to room_3. So steps:

19. toggle blue_door_1 (unlock)

20. gotoroom room_2 room_1 blue_door_1 (room_1)

21. pick blue_box_1

22. gotoroom room_1 room_2 blue_door_1 (room_2)

23. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4

24. gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1 (room_4)

25. gotodoor green_door_2 room_4 room_3

26. gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_2 (room_3)

27. drop blue_box_1 (now in room_3)

Then, steps to move grey_ball_1:

28. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_3

29. pick grey_ball_1

30. gotodoor green_door_2 room_3 room_4

31. gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_2 (room_4)

32. drop grey_ball_1 (now in room_4)

This is 32 steps. Still long.

But perhaps the agent can move grey_ball_1 while moving blue_box_1. For example, after step 27 (room_3 with blue_box_1), the agent can pick grey_ball_1 and carry it to room_4 when moving back. But that would require additional steps.

Alternatively, after step 27, the agent is in room_3, drops blue_box_1, picks grey_ball_1, and goes to room_4.

But I think given all constraints, it's impossible to avoid the lengthy steps. Therefore, the optimal plan would require at least these actions.

However, perhaps some steps can be optimized. For example, when moving from room_3 to room_4 and back, some gotoempty or gotoobject steps can be omitted if the agent is already in the correct position.

But according to the action preconditions, certain steps are required. For example, to pick an object, the agent must be in front of it, which requires a gotoobject action first.

Given the complexity, the optimal plan would need to carefully sequence actions to minimize steps while satisfying all constraints. After careful consideration, here's the step-by-step plan:
