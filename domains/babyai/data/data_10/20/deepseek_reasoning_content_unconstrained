Okay, let's tackle this planning problem step by step. The goal is to get to a blue door connecting room_1 and room_2, be in front of it, and have it unlocked. The initial state has me in room_3, and all doors are locked. The blue_door_1 connects room_1 and room_2, which is blue and currently locked. So the target door is blue_door_1.

First, I need to get to blue_door_1. But since all doors are locked, I need to unlock them. To unlock a door, I have to be in front of it and toggle it. But to get to the door, I might need to go through other doors, which are locked. Hmm, this seems tricky.

Looking at the connections: room_3 is connected to room_1 via purple_door_1 (locked) and to room_4 via green_door_2 (locked). Room_4 is connected to room_2 via green_door_1 (locked). Room_1 is connected to room_2 via blue_door_1 (locked). So all doors are locked. But how can I get to blue_door_1?

Wait, maybe there's a way to unlock doors by using objects. The toggle action requires being in front of the door. But to get in front of a door, I need to be in a room connected by that door. For example, to get in front of purple_door_1 in room_3, I can do "gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_1" but wait, the preconditions for gotodoor are that I'm in a room connected by the door and that there's no object blocking the position in front of the door. Are there any objects blocking doors?

In the initial state, the objects are in various rooms. Let's check each door's position. For example, in room_3, there's purple_box_1 and grey_ball_1. If the purple_door_1 is in room_3, is there an object blocking it? The problem says that to go to a door, there must be no object blocking the position in front of it. So if the door's position in the current room is blocked by an object, I can't go there. But the initial state doesn't mention any objects blocking doors. Wait, the problem's initial state doesn't state any objects blocking doors, so maybe all doors are accessible as long as I'm in the right room and the door isn't blocked by an object.

So, in room_3, can I go to purple_door_1? Since there's a purple_box_1 and grey_ball_1 in room_3, but unless they are in front of the door, they don't block it. The problem doesn't say they're blocking, so maybe it's safe. So, first step: goto the purple_door_1 in room_3.

But the purple_door_1 is locked. So I can "goto door purple_door_1 room_3 room_1", then "toggle purple_door_1" to unlock it. Then, use "gotoroom room_3 room_1 purple_door_1" to move to room_1.

Once in room_1, I need to get to blue_door_1. But blue_door_1 connects room_1 and room_2. So from room_1, I can go to blue_door_1. But blue_door_1 is locked. So I need to unlock it. But to get in front of it, I need to be in room_1 or room_2.

Since I'm in room_1 after moving through purple_door_1, I can "goto door blue_door_1 room_1 room_2". Then toggle it to unlock. Then, be in front of it, and it's unlocked. That would satisfy the goal.

But wait, the initial state says blue_door_1 is locked, and in room_1. So the plan would be:

1. From room_3, go to purple_door_1 (gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_1)
2. Toggle it (unlock)
3. Gotoroom to room_1 via purple_door_1
4. In room_1, goto blue_door_1 (gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2)
5. Toggle blue_door_1 (unlock)
6. Now, I'm in front of blue_door_1, which is unlocked. So the goal is achieved.

But wait, after step 3, when I move to room_1, I need to make sure that the path to blue_door_1 isn't blocked. Are there any objects in room_1 blocking blue_door_1? In room_1, there's red_box_1, blue_box_1, and purple_ball_1. If any of these are in front of the blue_door_1, then gotodoor blue_door_1 would fail. But the initial state doesn't mention their positions relative to the door. The problem says that objects are in rooms but not necessarily blocking doors unless specified. So assuming they're not blocking, the steps should work.

But let's check the constraints. The problem says the plan must satisfy all constraints, but in the given problem, there are no additional constraints mentioned beyond the preconditions. So the main constraints are the action preconditions and the goal.

So the steps would be:

1. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_1 (since I'm in room_3, and purple_door_1 connects room_3 and room_1)
2. toggle purple_door_1 (unlocks it)
3. gotoroom room_3 room_1 purple_door_1 (move to room_1)
4. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2 (now in room_1)
5. toggle blue_door_1 (unlock)
6. Now, the agent is in front of blue_door_1, which is blue, connects room_1 and room_2, and is unlocked. That meets the goal.

Wait, but the initial position is in room_3. After step 3, the agent is in room_1. Then step 4 is to go to the door blue_door_1 in room_1. Then step 5 toggles it. So after step 5, the agent is in front of blue_door_1 in room_1, and the door is unlocked. That should satisfy the goal.

Yes, this seems like a valid plan. Let me check each action's preconditions:

1. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_1: Precondition is that the agent is in a room connected by the door (room_3 is connected via purple_door_1 to room_1), and no object is blocking. Since no objects are mentioned as blocking, this is okay.

2. toggle purple_door_1: Agent is in front of the door after step 1, so allowed.

3. gotoroom room_3 room_1 purple_door_1: The door is now unlocked (after toggle), so moving is allowed.

4. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2: Agent is in room_1, which is connected via blue_door_1. Assuming no blocking objects.

5. toggle blue_door_1: Now in front of it, so allowed. This unlocks it.

Then, the final state meets the goal: blue_door_1 is blue, connects room_1 and room_2, agent is in front of it, and it's unlocked.

This plan has 5 actions. Is there a shorter way? Let me think. Maybe if there's a way to unlock blue_door_1 without going through room_1. But blue_door_1 is between room_1 and room_2. The agent starts in room_3. So to reach blue_door_1, the agent must go through either room_1 or room_2. Since room_3 connects to room_1 via purple_door_1 and to room_4 via green_door_2. Going through room_4 might require unlocking green_door_2 and green_door_1, which would take more steps. So the initial plan is the shortest.
