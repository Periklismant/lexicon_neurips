Let me understand the problem:

1. We have a 2D gridworld with 4 rooms in a square formation (room_1 is NW, room_2 is SW, room_3 is NE, room_4 is SE).
2. There are 4 doors connecting the rooms: grey_door_1 (room_1-room_2), purple_door_1 (room_1-room_3), yellow_door_1 (room_2-room_4), red_door_1 (room_3-room_4).
3. The rooms may have boxes and balls of different colors.
4. We have a set of actions with their preconditions and effects.

Initial State:
- We are in room_1.
- yellow_ball_1, green_box_1, and blue_ball_1 are in room_1.
- green_ball_1 and blue_box_1 are in room_2.
- green_ball_2, red_ball_1, and yellow_ball_2 are in room_3.
- All the doors are locked.
- We have visited room_1.

Goal:
- To find a yellow door (which is yellow_door_1), stand in front of it, and ensure it is unlocked.

Constraints:
1. At some point, we need to be in front of grey_door_1.
2. After being in front of grey_door_1, we must either keep grey_door_1 locked and be in front of green_box_1 immediately after, or do so at some later state.

Now, let's think through the problem:

1. We need to reach yellow_door_1, which is between room_2 and room_4.
2. We're currently in room_1, so we need to get to room_2 using grey_door_1.
3. To use grey_door_1, we need to unlock it.
4. Once we're in room_2, we need to reach yellow_door_1 and unlock it.

Let's devise a plan:

1. Go to grey_door_1 from room_1.
2. Toggle grey_door_1 to unlock it.
3. Go to room_2 from room_1 using grey_door_1.
4. Go to yellow_door_1 from room_2.
5. Toggle yellow_door_1 to unlock it.

But wait, we have a constraint that after being in front of grey_door_1, we need to either keep it locked and be in front of green_box_1, or do so at a later state. 

So, our plan might change to:

1. Go to grey_door_1 from room_1.
2. Go to green_box_1 from room_1 (we're keeping grey_door_1 locked as per the constraint).
3. Go to grey_door_1 from room_1 (again).
4. Toggle grey_door_1 to unlock it.
5. Go to room_2 from room_1 using grey_door_1.
6. Go to yellow_door_1 from room_2.
7. Toggle yellow_door_1 to unlock it.

But wait, I'm given a constraint that after being in front of grey_door_1, we must keep grey_door_1 locked and be in front of green_box_1. This doesn't let us unlock grey_door_1 right after going to it. We need to find a workaround.

Let's rethink our plan:

1. Go to grey_door_1 from room_1.
2. Go to green_box_1 from room_1 (we're keeping grey_door_1 locked as per the constraint).
3. Toggle grey_door_1 to unlock it.
4. Go to room_2 from room_1 using grey_door_1.
5. Go to yellow_door_1 from room_2.
6. Toggle yellow_door_1 to unlock it.

Actually, I think I'm misunderstanding the constraint. It says "If 'you are in front of grey_door_1' holds in some state s, then 'The following conditions are all true: grey_door_1 is locked, you are in front of green_box_1' must hold at s or at some state after s".

This means if we're ever in front of grey_door_1, then at that state or some future state, grey_door_1 must be locked and we must be in front of green_box_1. It doesn't mean we can't unlock grey_door_1 at some point, but it means we must ensure that at some state after being in front of grey_door_1, we have grey_door_1 locked and we're in front of green_box_1.

So, a valid plan could be:

1. Go to grey_door_1 from room_1.
2. Toggle grey_door_1 to unlock it.
3. Go to room_2 from room_1 using grey_door_1.
4. Go to yellow_door_1 from room_2.
5. Toggle yellow_door_1 to unlock it.
6. Go back to room_1 from room_2 using grey_door_1.
7. Toggle grey_door_1 to lock it.
8. Go to green_box_1 from room_1.

This way, we're in front of green_box_1 and grey_door_1 is locked, satisfying the constraint.

Wait, I think I got it wrong again. The constraint says "grey_door_1 is locked, you are in front of green_box_1". So, we need to be in front of green_box_1, and grey_door_1 should be locked. It doesn't say we need to be in front of grey_door_1 and it should be locked.

In our current plan, we unlock grey_door_1, go to room_2, unlock yellow_door_1, go back to room_1, lock grey_door_1, and go to green_box_1. This satisfies the constraint because after being in front of grey_door_1, we (at a later state) have grey_door_1 locked and we're in front of green_box_1.

Actually, there's a more efficient plan:

1. Go to grey_door_1 from room_1.
2. Go to green_box_1 from room_1. (Now, grey_door_1 is locked and we're in front of green_box_1, satisfying the constraint)
3. Toggle grey_door_1 to unlock it.
4. Go to room_2 from room_1 using grey_door_1.
5. Go to yellow_door_1 from room_2.
6. Toggle yellow_door_1 to unlock it.

This achieves our goal in 6 steps, and satisfies the constraint.

Actually, I realized that this plan doesn't work either. After going to green_box_1, we can't immediately toggle grey_door_1 because we're not in front of it.

Let's revise:

1. Go to grey_door_1 from room_1.
2. Go to green_box_1 from room_1. (Now, grey_door_1 is locked and we're in front of green_box_1, satisfying the constraint)
3. Go to grey_door_1 from room_1 (again).
4. Toggle grey_door_1 to unlock it.
5. Go to room_2 from room_1 using grey_door_1.
6. Go to yellow_door_1 from room_2.
7. Toggle yellow_door_1 to unlock it.

This plan should work. Let's check if it achieves our goal and satisfies the constraint.

Goal: Have a yellow door (yellow_door_1) that we're in front of and it's unlocked. This is achieved after step 7.

Constraint: If we're ever in front of grey_door_1, then at that state or some future state, grey_door_1 must be locked and we must be in front of green_box_1. This is satisfied after step 2.

All preconditions for the actions are met:
- "gotodoor" for grey_door_1 from room_1: We're in room_1, which is connected to room_2 by grey_door_1.
- "gotoobject" for green_box_1 from room_1: We're in room_1, and green_box_1 is in room_1.
- "gotodoor" for grey_door_1 from room_1 (again): We're in room_1, which is connected to room_2 by grey_door_1.
- "toggle" for grey_door_1: We're in front of grey_door_1.
- "gotoroom" from room_1 to room_2 using grey_door_1: We're in room_1, which is adjacent to room_2, and grey_door_1 is unlocked.
- "gotodoor" for yellow_door_1 from room_2: We're in room_2, which is connected to room_4 by yellow_door_1.
- "toggle" for yellow_door_1: We're in front of yellow_door_1.

All effects are as expected:

Okay, I think our plan is solid now. Let's review it once more:

1. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2
2. gotoobject green_box_1 room_1
3. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2
4. toggle grey_door_1
5. gotoroom room_1 room_2 grey_door_1
6. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_4
7. toggle yellow_door_1

Let me double check that we're meeting the constraints.

Constraint: "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'you are in front of grey_door_1'."
After step 1 and step 3, we're in front of grey_door_1, so the constraint is met.

Constraint: "If expression 'you are in front of grey_door_1' holds in some state s, then expression 'The following conditions are all true: "grey_door_1 is locked", "you are in front of green_box_1"' must hold at s or at some state after s."
After step 1, we're in front of grey_door_1. According to the constraint, at this state or at some state after, we need to have grey_door_1 locked and be in front of green_box_1. After step 2, we're in front of green_box_1 and grey_door_1 is still locked, so this constraint is satisfied.

However, I'm not sure if this also applies to step 3. If it does, then after step 3, we need to ensure that at some state, grey_door_1 is locked and we're in front of green_box_1. But we unlock grey_door_1 in step 4 and never lock it again. So, this would violate the constraint.

Let's reconsider. The constraint says "If expression 'you are in front of grey_door_1' holds in some state s, then expression 'The following conditions are all true: "grey_door_1 is locked", "you are in front of green_box_1"' must hold at s or at some state after s."

According to this, for every state in which we're in front of grey_door_1, we need to ensure there's a state (the same state or a later one) where grey_door_1 is locked and we're in front of green_box_1.

So, the right way to interpret this is: every time we're in front of grey_door_1, we need to follow it up with a state where grey_door_1 is locked and we're in front of green_box_1. Since we're in front of grey_door_1 twice in our plan (steps 1 and 3), we need to satisfy the constraint after each of these steps.

So, we need to revise our plan to ensure that after step 3, we still have a state where grey_door_1 is locked and we're in front of green_box_1. One way to achieve this is:

1. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2
2. gotoobject green_box_1 room_1  (After this step, we've satisfied the constraint for step 1)
3. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2
4. gotoobject green_box_1 room_1  (After this step, we've satisfied the constraint for step 3, but we're back where we were)

This is becoming a loop. We need to rethink our approach.

Actually, there might be a better interpretation of the constraint. It says: "If you're ever in front of grey_door_1, then at that moment or at a future moment, grey_door_1 is locked and you're in front of green_box_1". This doesn't mean we need to satisfy this every time we're in front of grey_door_1, just that if we're ever in front of grey_door_1, this condition must be true at some point during the remainder of our plan.

In our current plan:
1. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2  (We're in front of grey_door_1)
2. gotoobject green_box_1 room_1       (We're in front of green_box_1 and grey_door_1 is locked, satisfying the constraint)
3. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2  (We're in front of grey_door_1 again, so the constraint applies again)
4. toggle grey_door_1                 (We unlock grey_door_1)
5. gotoroom room_1 room_2 grey_door_1
6. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_4
7. toggle yellow_door_1

We don't ever have a state after step 3 where grey_door_1 is locked and we're in front of green_box_1. So, this plan violates the constraint.

Let's design a new plan that satisfies both constraints, but it differs based on how we interpret the second constraint.

Interpretation 1: If we're ever in front of grey_door_1, we need to ensure that, at some point in the remainder of our plan, grey_door_1 is locked and we're in front of green_box_1.

Plan for Interpretation 1:
1. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2  (We're in front of grey_door_1)
2. toggle grey_door_1                 (We unlock grey_door_1)
3. gotoroom room_1 room_2 grey_door_1  (We go to room_2)
4. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_4 (We're in front of yellow_door_1)
5. toggle yellow_door_1                (We unlock yellow_door_1)
6. gotoroom room_2 room_1 grey_door_1   (We go back to room_1)
7. toggle grey_door_1                  (We lock grey_door_1)
8. gotoobject green_box_1 room_1        (After this step, grey_door_1 is locked and we're in front of green_box_1, satisfying the constraint)

Interpretation 2: For every state in which we're in front of grey_door_1, we need to ensure there's a state (the same state or a later one) where grey_door_1 is locked and we're in front of green_box_1. If we're in front of grey_door_1 multiple times, we need to satisfy this condition after each such instance.

Plan for Interpretation 2:
1. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2   (We're in front of grey_door_1)
2. gotoobject green_box_1 room_1        (After this step, grey_door_1 is locked and we're in front of green_box_1, satisfying the constraint for step 1)
3. toggle grey_door_1                  (We can't toggle grey_door_1 from in front of green_box_1)

This plan won't work because after step 2, we're in front of green_box_1, not grey_door_1, so we can't toggle it.

I believe Interpretation 1 is more reasonable for this problem. So, let's go with that plan. However I failed to realize step 6 is invalid. We can't go from room_2 to room_1 using grey_door_1 if we're not in front of grey_door_1.

Let's fix it:

1. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2   (We're in front of grey_door_1)
2. toggle grey_door_1                  (We unlock grey_door_1)
3. gotoroom room_1 room_2 grey_door_1   (We go to room_2)
4. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_4  (We're in front of yellow_door_1)
5. toggle yellow_door_1                 (We unlock yellow_door_1, achieving our goal)
6. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_1    (We go to the grey door from room_2)
7. gotoroom room_2 room_1 grey_door_1    (We go back to room_1)
8. toggle grey_door_1                   (We lock grey_door_1)
9. gotoobject green_box_1 room_1         (After this step, grey_door_1 is locked and we're in front of green_box_1, satisfying the constraint)

This plan should work. But it's a bit longer than necessary. Can we optimize it?

Actually, I don't think it's necessary to include steps 6-9 in our plan, as we've already achieved our goal after step 5. Once we've unlocked yellow_door_1 and are in front of it, we've fulfilled our original task. The constraint about grey_door_1 only applies if we're ever in front of grey_door_1, which we are in step 1. The constraint then says at that state or some state afterwards, grey_door_1 must be locked and we must be in front of green_box_1. Since all doors are initially locked, including grey_door_1, we could achieve this by going to grey_door_1 and then to green_box_1 without unlocking grey_door_1.

So, a shorter but still valid plan would be:

1. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2   (We're in front of grey_door_1 and it's locked)
2. gotoobject green_box_1 room_1        (We're in front of green_box_1 and grey_door_1 is still locked, satisfying the constraint)
3. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2   (We go back to grey_door_1)
4. toggle grey_door_1                  (We unlock grey_door_1)
5. gotoroom room_1 room_2 grey_door_1   (We go to room_2)
6. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_4  (We're in front of yellow_door_1)
7. toggle yellow_door_1                 (We unlock yellow_door_1, achieving our goal)

Let's make sure this plan satisfies the constraints:

Constraint 1: "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'you are in front of grey_door_1'."
We're in front of grey_door_1 in steps 1 and 3, so this constraint is satisfied.

Constraint 2: "If expression 'you are in front of grey_door_1' holds in some state s, then expression 'The following conditions are all true: "grey_door_1 is locked", "you are in front of green_box_1"' must hold at s or at some state after s."
We're in front of grey_door_1 in step 1, and in step 2, grey_door_1 is locked and we're in front of green_box_1. So, the constraint is satisfied for step 1.
We're in front of grey_door_1 again in step 3. After this, we unlock grey_door_1 in step 4, and it remains unlocked for the rest of our plan. So, the constraint is not satisfied for step 3.

I think there's a misinterpretation on my part. The constraint doesn't say "For every state in which we're in front of grey_door_1, we need to ensure..." It says "If expression 'you are in front of grey_door_1' holds in some state s, then..."

This means if there's a state s where we're in front of grey_door_1, then at s or at some state after s, grey_door_1 must be locked and we must be in front of green_box_1. Since we're in front of grey_door_1 in step 1, and in step 2, grey_door_1 is locked and we're in front of green_box_1, the constraint is satisfied.

Now, let's get back to our plan. It satisfies all the constraints and achieves our goal. So, the plan is:

1. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2   (We're in front of grey_door_1 and it's locked)
2. gotoobject green_box_1 room_1        (We're in front of green_box_1 and grey_door_1 is still locked, satisfying the constraint)
3. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2   (We go back to grey_door_1)
4. toggle grey_door_1                  (We unlock grey_door_1)
5. gotoroom room_1 room_2 grey_door_1   (We go to room_2)
6. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_4  (We're in front of yellow_door_1)
7. toggle yellow_door_1                 (We unlock yellow_door_1, achieving our goal)

Let's make sure there are no further misinterpretations. The constraint says:

"If expression 
		'you are in front of grey_door_1'
		holds in some state s, then expression
		'The following conditions are all true: "grey_door_1 is locked", "you are in front of green_box_1"'
		must hold at s or at some state after s"

If there's any state in which we're in front of grey_door_1, then at that state or at some state after it, grey_door_1 must be locked and we must be in front of green_box_1.

Given our plan:
- In step 1, we're in front of grey_door_1.
- In step 2, grey_door_1 is locked and we're in front of green_box_1. This satisfies the constraint for step 1.
- In step 3, we're in front of grey_door_1 again.
- After step 3, we never have a state where grey_door_1 is locked and we're in front of green_box_1. This violates the constraint for step 3.

Mmm, I think I've been misunderstanding. Here's what the constraint is really saying: "for each state where 'you are in front of grey_door_1' is true, there must exist a state either equal to or after it where both 'grey_door_1 is locked' and 'you are in front of green_box_1' are true."

Given this correct interpretation, our plan violates the constraint because for step 3, there's no subsequent state where grey_door_1 is locked and we're in front of green_box_1.

Let's revise our plan. For our goal, we need to unlock yellow_door_1 and be in front of it. To do this, we need to get to room_2, which means we need to unlock grey_door_1. But, we also need to ensure that every time we're in front of grey_door_1, there's a state afterwards where grey_door_1 is locked and we're in front of green_box_1.

Here's a plan for a valid plan:

1. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2   (We're in front of grey_door_1)
2. gotoobject green_box_1 room_1        (After this step, grey_door_1 is locked and we're in front of green_box_1, satisfying the constraint for step 1)
3. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2   (We're in front of grey_door_1 again)
4. toggle grey_door_1                  (We unlock grey_door_1)
5. gotoroom room_1 room_2 grey_door_1   (We go to room_2)
6. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_4  (We're in front of yellow_door_1)
7. toggle yellow_door_1                 (We unlock yellow_door_1)
8. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_1    (We go to the grey door from room_2)
9. gotoroom room_2 room_1 grey_door_1    (We go back to room_1)
10. toggle grey_door_1                   (We lock grey_door_1)
11. gotoobject green_box_1 room_1         (After this step, grey_door_1 is locked and we're in front of green_box_1, satisfying the constraint for step 3)

This gives us a valid plan, but it's not the most optimal. We have to check if we can omit steps 8-11 and still have a valid plan, or if we're truly bound by the constraint to include them.

On second thought, I'm unsure if we'd need to worry about satisfying the constraint after achieving our goal. The goal is to unlock yellow_door_1 and be in front of it, which we've done after step 7.

But, to be safe and to ensure our plan is valid under the strictest interpretation of the constraints, let's go with the longer plan:

1. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2   (We're in front of grey_door_1)
2. gotoobject green_box_1 room_1        (After this step, grey_door_1 is locked and we're in front of green_box_1, satisfying the constraint for step 1)
3. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2   (We're in front of grey_door_1 again)
4. toggle grey_door_1                  (We unlock grey_door_1)
5. gotoroom room_1 room_2 grey_door_1   (We go to room_2)
6. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_4  (We're in front of yellow_door_1)
7. toggle yellow_door_1                 (We unlock yellow_door_1)
8. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_1    (We go to the grey door from room_2)
9. gotoroom room_2 room_1 grey_door_1    (We go back to room_1)
10. toggle grey_door_1                   (We lock grey_door_1)
11. gotoobject green_box_1 room_1         (After this step, grey_door_1 is locked and we're in front of green_box_1, satisfying the constraint for step 3)

This plan satisfies both constraints and achieves our goal.

Actually, now I'm not sure that I need to include steps 8-11. The goal is clearly defined as having a yellow door unlocked and being in front of it, which is achieved after step 7. The constraints should only apply up until the goal is achieved. Including steps 8-11 ensures the constraint is fully satisfied for the entire plan, but they might not be necessary if we assume the plan ends after the goal is achieved.

To be safe, let's include all steps for a complete plan that satisfies all constraints:

1. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2   (We're in front of grey_door_1)
2. gotoobject green_box_1 room_1        (After this step, grey_door_1 is locked and we're in front of green_box_1, satisfying the constraint for step 1)
3. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2   (We're in front of grey_door_1 again)
4. toggle grey_door_1                  (We unlock grey_door_1)
5. gotoroom room_1 room_2 grey_door_1   (We go to room_2)
6. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_4  (We're in front of yellow_door_1)
7. toggle yellow_door_1                 (We unlock yellow_door_1, achieving our goal)
8. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_1    (We go to the grey door from room_2)
9. gotoroom room_2 room_1 grey_door_1    (We go back to room_1)
10. toggle grey_door_1                   (We lock grey_door_1)
11. gotoobject green_box_1 room_1         (After this step, grey_door_1 is locked and we're in front of green_box_1, satisfying the constraint for step 3)

Actually, I've been overthinking this. The goal statement clearly says "...your task is to provide a valid sequence of actions that solves the planning problem, i.e., bringing about the goal of the problem while satisfying all constraints."

This means our plan must bring about the goal (which we've identified as having a yellow door unlocked and being in front of it) AND satisfy all constraints. There's no implication that the constraints only apply up to the goal state.

So, a valid plan would be:

1. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2   (We're in front of grey_door_1)
2. gotoobject green_box_1 room_1        (After this step, grey_door_1 is locked and we're in front of green_box_1, satisfying the constraint for step 1)
3. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2   (We're in front of grey_door_1 again)
4. toggle grey_door_1                  (We unlock grey_door_1)
5. gotoroom room_1 room_2 grey_door_1   (We go to room_2)
6. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_4  (We're in front of yellow_door_1)
7. toggle yellow_door_1                 (We unlock yellow_door_1, achieving our goal)
8. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_1    (We go to the grey door from room_2)
9. gotoroom room_2 room_1 grey_door_1    (We go back to room_1)
10. toggle grey_door_1                   (We lock grey_door_1)
11. gotoobject green_box_1 room_1         (After this step, grey_door_1 is locked and we're in front of green_box_1, satisfying the constraint for step 3)

Upon further reflection, I'm not sure if steps 8-11 are necessary, because the goal was achieved after step 7. However, to be safe and ensure all constraints are satisfied, I'll stick with the full plan.

Alright then, the final plan is:

1. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2
2. gotoobject green_box_1 room_1
3. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2
4. toggle grey_door_1
5. gotoroom room_1 room_2 grey_door_1
6. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_4
7. toggle yellow_door_1
8. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_1
9. gotoroom room_2 room_1 grey_door_1
10. toggle grey_door_1
11. gotoobject green_box_1 room_1

With this plan, we achieve our goal (having the yellow door unlocked and being in front of it) and satisfy all constraints. The first constraint is met because we're in front of grey_door_1 in steps 1, 3, and 8. The second constraint is met because after step 1, we have a state (step 2) where grey_door_1 is locked and we're in front of green_box_1, and after step 3, we have a state (step 11) where grey_door_1 is locked and we're in front of green_box_1.

Actually, for the constraint:
"If expression 
		'you are in front of grey_door_1'
		holds in some state s, then expression
		'The following conditions are all true: "grey_door_1 is locked", "you are in front of green_box_1"'
		must hold at s or at some state after s"

We're in front of grey_door_1 in step 8, but we don't have a state after that where grey_door_1 is locked and we're in front of green_box_1. In step 10, we lock grey_door_1, and in step 11, we're in front of green_box_1. So, after step 8, grey_door_1 is locked in step 10 and we're in front of green_box_1 in step 11, but these conditions aren't met in the same state.

Let's fix this:

1. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2   (We're in front of grey_door_1)
2. gotoobject green_box_1 room_1        (After this step, grey_door_1 is locked and we're in front of green_box_1, satisfying the constraint for step 1)
3. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2   (We're in front of grey_door_1 again)
4. toggle grey_door_1                  (We unlock grey_door_1)
5. gotoroom room_1 room_2 grey_door_1   (We go to room_2)
6. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_4  (We're in front of yellow_door_1)
7. toggle yellow_door_1                 (We unlock yellow_door_1, achieving our goal)
8. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_1    (We go to the grey door from room_2)
9. toggle grey_door_1                   (We lock grey_door_1)
10. gotoroom room_2 room_1 grey_door_1    (We go back to room_1)
11. gotoobject green_box_1 room_1         (After this step, grey_door_1 is locked and we're in front of green_box_1, satisfying the constraint for step 3 and step 8)

But wait, after step 8, we're in front of grey_door_1 from the room_2 side. Can we toggle the door from either side? If we can, then the above plan works. If not, there's an issue.

Let's reconsider. The actions in this domain have the following preconditions:
"toggle": you may only toggle a door d if you are in front of d.

So, as long as we're in front of the door, we can toggle it. Doesn't matter which side. So, the plan should work.

Wait, I see an issue. I'm proposing "gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_1" in step 8, but I just realized that the door might be on the room_1 side if that's where we initially interacted with it. If that's the case, this action would fail because we're trying to go to a door in room_2 that's not there.

Let's replan, being clear about which room the door is in:

1. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2   (We approach grey_door_1 from room_1)
2. gotoobject green_box_1 room_1        (We're in front of green_box_1 in room_1. grey_door_1 is locked, satisfying the constraint)
3. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2   (We approach grey_door_1 from room_1 again)
4. toggle grey_door_1                  (We unlock grey_door_1)
5. gotoroom room_1 room_2 grey_door_1   (We move from room_1 to room_2 using grey_door_1)
6. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_4  (We approach yellow_door_1 from room_2)
7. toggle yellow_door_1                 (We unlock yellow_door_1, achieving our goal)

So, our goal is achieved after step 7. But, we're left with a second occurrence of being in front of grey_door_1 (in step 3) without a subsequent state where grey_door_1 is locked and we're in front of green_box_1.

To fix this, I think we'd have to add more steps:

8. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_1    (We approach grey_door_1 from room_2)
9. toggle grey_door_1                   (We lock grey_door_1)
10. gotoroom room_2 room_1 grey_door_1    (We move from room_2 to room_1 using grey_door_1)
11. gotoobject green_box_1 room_1         (We go to green_box_1. Now, grey_door_1 is locked and we're in front of green_box_1, satisfying the constraint for step 3)

But now, we have a third occurrence of being in front of grey_door_1 (in step 8) without a subsequent state that satisfies the constraint. And if we add more steps to fix this, we'll create another occurrence, leading to an infinite loop.

I think I'm overthinking this problem. Let me re-read the original constraints.

So, to clarify the constraint:
"If expression 
		'you are in front of grey_door_1'
		holds in some state s, then expression
		'The following conditions are all true: "grey_door_1 is locked", "you are in front of green_box_1"'
		must hold at s or at some state after s"

The key here is "holds in some state s". We are in front of grey_door_1 in step 1, and after that, we satisfy the constraint in step 2. We're also in front of grey_door_1 in step 3, but we don't have a subsequent state that satisfies the constraint.

I think the constraint is ambiguous. Let me interpret it this way: "for any state s in which 'you are in front of grey_door_1' is true, there must exist at least one state (s itself or a state after s) in which both 'grey_door_1 is locked' and 'you are in front of green_box_1' are true."

Given this interpretation, and the fact that we're in front of grey_door_1 in steps 1 and 3, we need to make sure that for both of these states, there's at least one state (the state itself or a state after it) in which grey_door_1 is locked and we're in front of green_box_1.

For step 1, this is satisfied in step 2.

For step 3, we don't have a state after it where grey_door_1 is locked and we're in front of green_box_1. This is the issue, and it means our current plan doesn't satisfy the constraint.

Given our goal (having a yellow door unlocked and being in front of it), the optimal plan would be to first satisfy the constraint for step 1 (being in front of grey_door_1) by going to green_box_1 when grey_door_1 is still locked. Then, we go to grey_door_1, unlock it, go to room_2, go to yellow_door_1, and unlock it. This achieves our goal.

But, since the constraint says "for any state s in which 'you are in front of grey_door_1' is true", we need to ensure this for step 3 as well. This is where the plan gets tricky.

Maybe the constraint can be interpreted as "for any state s in which we stand in front of the door for a purpose beyond just passing through, the constraint must hold". In step 1, we stand there to fulfill the first constraint. In step 3, we stand there with the intention to unlock the door. These are deliberate actions, not just passing by.

But wait, that's an interpretation on my part, not inherently given in the constraint. But it make little sense to have the constraint for every time we're in front of the door, as it would create an infinite loop.

Ok let's try again. I think I was overthinking and putting constraints where there are none. Let's re-read the problem statement to get a clear understanding.

The problem states:
"The task is to bring about the following situation:
	"There is a door d such that "The following conditions are all true: "d is yellow", "you are in front of d", "d is not locked"""

So, our goal is to have a yellow door (which is yellow_door_1 based on the initial state) which is unlocked and we're standing in front of it.

The constraints are:
1. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'you are in front of grey_door_1'"
2. "If expression 'you are in front of grey_door_1' holds in some state s, then expression 'The following conditions are all true: "grey_door_1 is locked", "you are in front of green_box_1"' must hold at s or at some state after s"

Constraint 1 is clear: at some point, we must be in front of grey_door_1.

Constraint 2 is saying: if there's a state s where we're in front of grey_door_1, then at some state (s itself or a later state), grey_door_1 must be locked and we must be in front of green_box_1.

To achieve our goal, we need to get to yellow_door_1 and unlock it. Yellow_door_1 is between room_2 and room_4, so we need to get to either of these rooms.

Given the initial state, we're in room_1. From room_1, we can go to room_2 via grey_door_1 or to room_3 via purple_door_1. Since room_2 is directly connected to our destination (room_4) via yellow_door_1, let's go via room_2.

To get from room_1 to room_2, we need to unlock grey_door_1. But we also need to satisfy the constraints.

Constraint 1 is satisfied if we stand in front of grey_door_1, which we'll do in our plan.

Constraint 2 doesn't necessarily make our task more difficult. Let me take a step back. The constraint says: "if there's a state s where we're in front of grey_door_1, then at some state (s itself or a later state), grey_door_1 must be locked and we must be in front of green_box_1."

Most interpreations of this statement suggest that everytime we're in front of grey_door_1 (there can be multiple such times in our plan), there must be a state after that where grey_door_1 is locked and we're in front of green_box_1.

BUT, the statement can also be interpreted as: "if there's any state in our plan where we're in front of grey_door_1, then our plan must include at least one state (which can be the same state or a later one) where grey_door_1 is locked and we're in front of green_box_1."

Given the problem statement, I think the second interpretation makes more sense.

Actually, the problem statement says:

A valid plan for the abovementioned problem must abide by the following constraints:
	"The following expression must hold in at least one state: 
		"you are in front of grey_door_1""
	"If expression 
		"you are in front of grey_door_1"
		holds in some state s, then expression
		"The following conditions are all true: "grey_door_1 is locked", "you are in front of green_box_1""
		must hold at s or at some state after s"


Reading it again, I think the first interpretation is correct. If there's any state s in our plan where we're in front of grey_door_1, then there must be a state (s itself or a later state) where grey_door_1 is locked and we're in front of green_box_1.

This means, if we're in front of grey_door_1 multiple times, after each such instance, grey_door_1 must remain locked or return to being locked, and we must be in front of green_box_1. This would create the problem I described earlier.

I think the best way to understand this is that the constraint is a universally quantified statement over states in the plan. For every state s in the plan, if you are in front of grey_door_1 in state s, then there must be a state s' (either s itself or a state after s) such that grey_door_1 is locked and you are in front of green_box_1.

With this in mind, let's try a different approach. We know that we'll be in front of grey_door_1 at least once, and after that, grey_door_1 must be locked and we must be in front of green_box_1. Let's first ensure this portion of the constraint is satisfied, and then proceed to achieve our goal.

For each step, I'll note any violations of the constraint, if any:

1. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2   (We approach grey_door_1 from room_1. Constraint 1 is now satisfied. For Constraint 2, we're in front of grey_door_1, so at some point from now on, grey_door_1 must be locked and we must be in front of green_box_1.)
2. gotoobject green_box_1 room_1        (We're in front of green_box_1 in room_1. grey_door_1 is still locked. No constraints violated.)

We've addressed the constraints. Now, let's achieve our goal, which is to get to yellow_door_1 and unlock it. This requires us to go back to grey_door_1 and unlock it. But every time we're in front of grey_door_1, there must be a subsequent state where grey_door_1 is locked and we're in front of green_box_1. This introduces a repetitive pattern, as I mentioned earlier.

Here's the plan for the remainder of our task:

3. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2   (We're in front of grey_door_1. Now, we must have a subsequent state where grey_door_1 is locked and we're in front of green_box_1, but we'll be unlocking grey_door_1 next, so this won't be immediately satisfied.)
4. toggle grey_door_1                  (We unlock grey_door_1. Constraint 2 is potentially unsatisfied for the grey_door_1 visit in step 3, but we'll make sure to satisfy it later.)
5. gotoroom room_1 room_2 grey_door_1   (We go to room_2. No constraints violated.)
6. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_4  (We're in front of yellow_door_1. No constraints violated.)
7. toggle yellow_door_1                 (We unlock yellow_door_1. Our goal is achieved. No constraints violated, except for possibly the violation from step 3.)

Alright, we've achieved our goal. But we have a potential violation from step 3, where we were in front of grey_door_1, but we don't have a subsequent state where grey_door_1 is locked and we're in front of green_box_1. Let's modify our plan to address this.

3. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2   
4. toggle grey_door_1                  
5. gotoroom room_1 room_2 grey_door_1   
6. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_4  
7. toggle yellow_door_1                 
8. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_1    (We're in front of grey_door_1 from room_2. Constraint 2 requires a subsequent state where grey_door_1 is locked and we're in front of green_box_1, but at the moment, we don't have that in our plan.)
9. toggle grey_door_1                   (We lock grey_door_1.)
10. gotoroom room_2 room_1 grey_door_1    (We go back to room_1. No constraints violated.)
11. gotoobject green_box_1 room_1         (We're in front of green_box_1 and grey_door_1 is locked. Constraint 2 for step 3 is now satisfied. Constraint 2 for step 8 is also satisfied.)

But in the above, are we violating the precondition of step 10? If grey_door_1 is locked, how can we use it to go from room_2 to room_1?

The actions of this domain have the following preconditions:
"goto room": you may only go in a room r if (i) you are currently in a room r0 that is adjacent to r, and (ii) the door that is connecting r0 and r is unlocked.

So, by locking grey_door_1 in step 9, we would be preventing our ability to go from room_2 to room_1 using grey_door_1. I think our plan needs to be revisited.

Actually, should I be thinking of stepping through grey_door_1 after toggling it? Maybe step 4 should be followed directly by step 5, and our revised plan would be:

1. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2   
2. gotoobject green_box_1 room_1        
3. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2   
4. toggle grey_door_1                  
5. gotoroom room_1 room_2 grey_door_1   
6. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_4  
7. toggle yellow_door_1                 

So, after step 7, we've achieved our goal, but we have a potential constraint violation from step 3. Could there be a way to address this without locking ourselves between rooms?

Actually, I think I'm misinterpreting the constraint again. Let's be very precise:
"If expression 'you are in front of grey_door_1' holds in some state s, then expression 'The following conditions are all true: "grey_door_1 is locked", "you are in front of green_box_1"' must hold at s or at some state after s."

This is a universal statement over states. It's saying: for every state in which you're in front of grey_door_1, there must be a subsequent state (or the same state) in which grey_door_1 is locked and you're in front of green_box_1.

If we stand in front of grey_door_1 in step 3, then at some state after it, grey_door_1 must be locked and we must be in front of green_box_1. But where in our plan does this condition get satisfied? After achieving our goal, we would have an unsatisfied constraint.

Here's our current best plan with the potential in constraint 2 caused by step 3:

1. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2
2. gotoobject green_box_1 room_1
3. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2
4. toggle grey_door_1
5. gotoroom room_1 room_2 grey_door_1
6. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_4
7. toggle yellow_door_1

Note that after step 3 we don't have any state in our plan with grey_door_1 is locked and we're in front of green_box_1, which violates constraint 2.

Wait, what if I can satisify constraint 2 in step 3 itself? Let me try to see if it's possible for grey_door_1 to be locked and for us to be in front of green_box_1 at the same time. Is that possible? Can we be in front of two objects at the same time?

Based on the effects of the "goto" actions, particularly the part that says "if you were in front of some object or door x0, then you are no longer in front of x0", it seems that we can't be in front of multiple objects at the same time. This means we can't be in front of grey_door_1 and green_box_1 at the same time.

Wait. Since we know that to satisfy the constraint, for each state where we're in front of grey_door_1, there must be a subsequent state in the plan where grey_door_1 is locked and we're in front of green_box_1, and our goal is to have a plan that has at least one state where we're in front of grey_door_1, maybe the simplest solution is to have just one state in our plan where we're in front of grey_door_1.

Our plan would then be:

1. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2   (We're in front of grey_door_1.)
2. gotoobject green_box_1 room_1        (We're in front of green_box_1. grey_door_1 is still locked, so Constraint 2 is satisfied.)
3. gotoempty                           (We go to an empty position in room_1, away from objects or doors.)
4. toggle grey_door_1                  (Wait, this won't work because we're not in front of grey_door_1.)

This plan won't work, as expected, because we can't toggle a door when we're not in front of it. We need to be in front of grey_door_1 to toggle it, which means we'll be in front of grey_door_1 at least twice in our plan.

Wait, can we  pick up the green box, go to the grey door, unlock it, and then go to room_2?

Our plan would be:

1. gotoobject green_box_1 room_1      (We go to green_box_1.)
2. pick green_box_1 room_1            (We pick up green_box_1.)
3. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2 (We're in front of grey_door_1.)
4. drop green_box_1 room_1           (We drop green_box_1. Now, we're in front of green_box_1 and grey_door_1 is still locked, satisfying Constraint 2.)
5. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2 (We're in front of grey_door_1 again.)
6. toggle grey_door_1                (We unlock grey_door_1. Constraint 2 is potentially unsatisfied for this second visit to grey_door_1.)

Seems we're back to the same problem. I'm at a loss on how to satisfy this constraint for multiple visits to grey_door_1 without creating a recursive pattern.

Actually, I know. We don't have to satisfy constraint 2 for step 5 above, because by that point we're no longer in front of grey_door_1 anymore, we're in front of green_box_1. So once we drop green_box_1, we're standing in front of it, and no longer in front of grey_door_1.

Let me clarify:

1. gotoobject green_box_1 room_1      (We go to green_box_1.)
2. pick green_box_1 room_1            (We pick up green_box_1.)
3. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2 (We're in front of grey_door_1. For Constraint 2, we're in front of grey_door_1, so at some point from now on, grey_door_1 must be locked and we must be in front of green_box_1.)
4. toggle grey_door_1                (We unlock grey_door_1. Constraint 2 is potentially unsatisfied for this visit to grey_door_1.)

Ugh, this doesn't work either. It has the typical problem where after step 3, we have to satisfy Constraint 2. But I don't think we'll ever be able to satisfy it for the entire plan, because we need to unlock grey_door_1. If we try another approach, such as dropping green_box_1 after step 3, then we'll be facing even more issues with the constraint.

I think I'm overthinking this challenge a bit. Let me step back and consider the constraint a bit differently.

So constraint 2 says:
"If expression 'you are in front of grey_door_1' holds in some state s, then expression 'The following conditions are all true: "grey_door_1 is locked", "you are in front of green_box_1"' must hold at s or at some state after s."

This doesn't necessarily mean there needs to be a state after step 3 where grey_door_1 is locked and we're in front of green_box_1. There might be a more straightforward interpretation: for every state s where we're in front of grey_door_1, there must be a state (s itself or a later one) where grey_door_1 is locked and we're in front of green_box_1. But this doesn't mean right after s. It could be many steps after s.

This interpretation would mean we can have our original plan:

1. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2   (We're in front of grey_door_1 and it's locked. For Constraint 2, at some state from now or later, grey_door_1 must be locked and we must be in front of green_box_1.)
2. gotoobject green_box_1 room_1        (We're in front of green_box_1 and grey_door_1 is still locked. Constraint 2 for step 1 is satisfied here.)
3. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2   (We're in front of grey_door_1 again. For Constraint 2, at some state from now or later, grey_door_1 must be locked and we must be in front of green_box_1.)
4. toggle grey_door_1                  (We unlock grey_door_1.)
5. gotoroom room_1 room_2 grey_door_1   (We go to room_2.)
6. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_4  (We go to yellow_door_1.)
7. toggle yellow_door_1                 (We unlock yellow_door_1, achieving our goal.)

After step 7, we have a state where we've achieved our goal, but we have a potential violation of Constraint 2 for step 3. If the plan needs to be fully valid, we would need to extend it:

8. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_1    (We go to grey_door_1 from room_2.)
9. toggle grey_door_1                   (We lock grey_door_1.)
10. gotoroom room_2 room_1 grey_door_1    (Wait, this won't work if grey_door_1 is locked. We can't go through a locked door.)

This approach also leads to a contradiction. It seems like a vicious cycle: we need to unlock the door to achieve our goal, but then we need to lock it to satisfy the constraint, but after locking it, we can't move back and forth to satisfy the constraint for subsequent visits to the door.

Maybe we're supposed to use a different door? Instad of grey_door_1, would it be better to go through purple_door_1 to room_3 and then through red_door_1 to room_4?

Then we can completely avoid grey_door_1 right? Actually we can't avoid grey_door_1, if read the first constraint: "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'you are in front of grey_door_1'", it is an obligation to visit grey_door_1.

So maybe the way to approach this is:

1. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2   (We satisfy the obligation to be in front of grey_door_1.)
2. gotoobject green_box_1 room_1        (We satisfy the constraint that after being in front of grey_door_1, there must be a state where grey_door_1 is locked and we're in front of green_box_1.)
3. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_3  (We go to purple_door_1 instead of back to grey_door_1.)
4. toggle purple_door_1                 (We unlock purple_door_1.)
5. gotoroom room_1 room_3 purple_door_1  (We go from room_1 to room_3.)
6. gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_4     (We go to red_door_1.)
7. toggle red_door_1                    (We unlock red_door_1.)
8. gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_1     (We go from room_3 to room_4.)
9. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_2   (We go to yellow_door_1 from the room_4 side.)
10. toggle yellow_door_1                  (We unlock yellow_door_1, achieving our goal.)

I think this satisfies all the constraints:
1. We're in front of grey_door_1 in step 1, satisfying the first constraint.
2. After step 1, we have step 2 where grey_door_1 is locked and we're in front of green_box_1, satisfying the second constraint.
3. We don't go to grey_door_1 again, so there's no potential violation of the second constraint for additional visits to grey_door_1.

Hmm wait, I think I really was overthinking.

Let me re-read the constraint one more time:
"If expression 'you are in front of grey_door_1' holds in some state s, then expression 'The following conditions are all true: "grey_door_1 is locked", "you are in front of green_box_1"' must hold at s or at some state after s."

For every state s where we're in front of grey_door_1, grey_door_1 must be locked and we must be in front of green_box_1 at s or at some state after s. But this doesn't mean that that the locked door and being in front of the green box need to happen at the same time!

The constraint read: "if [condition A] holds in s, then [condition B and condition C] must hold at s or at some state after s."

I think the proper reading of this is that if condition A holds in state s, then both condition B and condition C must hold *simultaneously* in at least once state (s or some state after s).

So I think my original interpretation is correct. For every state s in which we're in front of grey_door_1, there has to be a subsequent state s' (which can be s itself) in which both of the following are true: grey_door_1 is locked and we're in front of green_box_1.

I think the optimal plan is:

1. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2   (We satisfy the obligation to be in front of grey_door_1.)
2. gotoobject green_box_1 room_1        (We satisfy the constraint that after being in front of grey_door_1, there must be a state where grey_door_1 is locked and we're in front of green_box_1.)
3. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_3  (We go to purple_door_1 instead of back to grey_door_1.)
4. toggle purple_door_1                 (We unlock purple_door_1.)
5. gotoroom room_1 room_3 purple_door_1  (We go from room_1 to room_3.)
6. gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_4     (We go to red_door_1.)
7. toggle red_door_1                    (We unlock red_door_1.)
8. gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_1     (We go from room_3 to room_4.)
9. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_2   (We go to yellow_door_1 from the room_4 side.)
10. toggle yellow_door_1                  (We unlock yellow_door_1, achieving our goal.)

This accomplishes our task and adheres to all constraints.

Here's the final plan:

1. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2
2. gotoobject green_box_1 room_1
3. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_3
4. toggle purple_door_1
5. gotoroom room_1 room_3 purple_door_1
6. gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_4
7. toggle red_door_1
8. gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_1
9. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_2
10. toggle yellow_door_1
