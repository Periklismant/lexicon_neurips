```
gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2
```
``` 

The optimal plan consists of a single action: moving in front of the yellow ball (yellow_ball_1) in room_2. Since the agent starts in room_2 where the yellow ball is located, and no doors need to be unlocked or objects moved, this directly achieves the goal of being in front of a yellow ball with minimal steps.
