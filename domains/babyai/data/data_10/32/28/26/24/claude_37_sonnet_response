Let me analyze this problem:

1. Initial state:
   - We are in room_1
   - Various boxes and balls are distributed in rooms 2 and 4
   - All doors are locked: blue_door_1 (connecting rooms 1-2), blue_door_2 (connecting rooms 1-3), yellow_door_1 (connecting rooms 2-4), purple_door_1 (connecting rooms 3-4)
   - We are not holding any object

2. Goal:
   - Be in front of yellow_door_1 (connecting rooms 2-4)
   - yellow_door_1 should be unlocked

3. Constraints:
   - At some point, we need to be in front of blue_door_1
   - Before we are in front of blue_door_1, we must be holding some object

Now, let's trace the steps to achieve the goal:

1. We need to get to room_2 to access yellow_door_1, but all doors are locked
2. We need to unlock blue_door_1 first to move between rooms 1 and 2
3. Before going in front of blue_door_1, we must pick up some object
4. No objects are in room_1 initially, so we need to get to rooms with objects

Let's think about it step by step:

1. I can't go to room_2 or room_3 directly because all doors are locked.
2. I need to unlock blue_door_1 to get to room_2, but before going in front of blue_door_1, I must be holding an object.
3. There are no objects in room_1 initially.

Wait, I think there's a circular dependency here. Let me reevaluate:

1. I need to go to yellow_door_1, which means I need to be in room_2 or room_4.
2. To get to room_2, I need to unlock blue_door_1.
3. Before going in front of blue_door_1, I must hold an object, but I can't get any objects because they're in other rooms.

Hmm, let me check the preconditions and effects again...

The constraint says: "If expression 'you are in front of blue_door_1' holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: 'you are holding some object'"

This means I must pick up an object at some point before going in front of blue_door_1.

Let me carefully review the available actions and think about this:

Actually, I need to first check if I can go to an empty position in room_1, then go to blue_door_1, toggle it, move to room_2, pick up an object, go back to room_1, go to blue_door_1 (fulfilling the constraint since I held an object earlier), and then proceed to yellow_door_1.

Let's try this approach:

1. gotoempty (go to an empty position in room_1)
2. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2 (go in front of blue_door_1)
3. toggle blue_door_1 (unlock blue_door_1)
4. gotoroom room_1 room_2 blue_door_1 (go to room_2)
5. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_2 (go to grey_box_1 in room_2)
6. pick grey_box_1 room_2 (pick up grey_box_1)
7. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_4 (go to yellow_door_1)
8. toggle yellow_door_1 (unlock yellow_door_1)

Wait, we have a problem. The constraint is interpreted as: before I ever go in front of blue_door_1, I must have held an object. But I can't get to any object without going through blue_door_1 first.

Let me rethink this. The constraint says:

"If expression 'you are in front of blue_door_1' holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: 'you are holding some object'"

This means I can't go to blue_door_1 until after I've held an object. But I can't get to an object without going through a door, and all doors are locked.

I need to find a solution to this apparent circular dependency.

Ah, I see an oversight! The constraint requires that BEFORE I stand in front of blue_door_1, I must have held an object. It doesn't say I need to be holding the object when I'm in front of blue_door_1.

So I could:
1. Unlock blue_door_1 without standing directly in front of it
2. Go to room_2, pick up an object
3. Then later go in front of blue_door_1 (after having held an object)
4. Continue to yellow_door_1

But can I unlock blue_door_1 without standing in front of it? Let me check the action preconditions again.

The toggle action says: "you may only toggle a door d if you are in front of d."

So I do need to stand in front of the door to unlock it.

Let me reconsider. I need to:
1. Get an object
2. At some point after holding that object, go in front of blue_door_1
3. End up in front of an unlocked yellow_door_1

The challenge is that all objects are in rooms I can't access because all doors are locked.

Wait, I may have misunderstood the constraints. Let me revisit them:

"The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'you are in front of blue_door_1'"

"If expression 'you are in front of blue_door_1' holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: 'you are holding some object'"

So the constraints say:
1. At some point, I must be in front of blue_door_1
2. Before I ever go in front of blue_door_1, I must have held some object

But the constraint doesn't say I have to go in front of blue_door_1 before unlocking it. Maybe I can unlock it by some other means? Let me check again.

No, the toggle action requires being in front of the door. And I can't go in front of blue_door_1 until after I've held an object. But I can't get an object without going through a door, and all doors are locked.

Let's carefully examine the problem again. If all doors are locked, how can I get any object, which I need before going in front of blue_door_1?

Ok, I think I've been missing something important. The constraint says I need to have held an object before going in front of blue_door_1, but it doesn't mean I need to hold it immediately before. I can:

1. Unlock blue_door_1 (by standing in front of it and toggling)
2. Go to room_2
3. Pick up an object
4. Go back to room_1
5. Go in front of blue_door_1 again (now satisfying the constraint because I've previously held an object)
6. Proceed to yellow_door_1

Let me check if this plan works or if there's a better approach.

Wait, this doesn't work either. The constraint still says that before I ever go in front of blue_door_1, I must have held an object.

Let me carefully reread the problem statement to make sure I haven't missed anything.

I finally understand. The constraint says that IF I ever go in front of blue_door_1, then I must have previously held an object. This means:

1. I must go in front of blue_door_1 at some point (constraint 1)
2. Before that point, I must have held an object (constraint 2)

But there's no object in room_1, and all doors are locked. How do I resolve this paradox?

The key insight is that the constraints only specify the order of events, not how to achieve them. Let me try a different approach:

1. Start in room_1
2. Go to blue_door_1 (satisfying constraint 1)
3. Toggle blue_door_1 to unlock it
4. Go to room_2
5. Pick up an object in room_2
6. Go back to room_1
7. Go to blue_door_2
8. Toggle blue_door_2 to unlock it
9. Go to room_3
10. Go to purple_door_1 
11. Toggle purple_door_1 to unlock it
12. Go to room_4
13. Go to yellow_door_1
14. Toggle yellow_door_1 to unlock it
15. Drop the object
16. Go to blue_door_1 again (now satisfying constraint 2 because I held an object earlier)
17. Go back to room_2
18. Go to yellow_door_1 (achieving the goal)

Wait, but this still doesn't satisfy the constraint because I go to blue_door_1 before I've held any object.

Let me restate the second constraint more carefully: "If expression 'you are in front of blue_door_1' holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: 'you are holding some object'"

This means: "If at any point you are in front of blue_door_1, then at some earlier point you must have been holding an object."

Now I think we're getting somewhere. Let's review the problem again:

Actually, I think I've been overcomplicating things. Let's go back to basics:

1. I start in room_1 with no objects
2. No objects are in room_1
3. All doors are locked
4. I need to unlock and go through doors to get objects, but I need to satisfy the constraints.

Let's check the preconditions for the following actions again:
- "goto door": I can go to a door if I'm in the same room and nothing blocks it
- "toggle": I can toggle a door if I'm in front of it
- "goto room": I can go to a room if the connecting door is unlocked

I'm in room_1, and no objects are blocking the doors, so I can go to blue_door_1 or blue_door_2. The problem is that if I go to blue_door_1, I must have previously held an object.

Wait, I realize it might not be possible to satisfy both constraints simultaneously. Let's read them again:

1. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'you are in front of blue_door_1'"
2. "If expression 'you are in front of blue_door_1' holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: 'you are holding some object'"

Let me see if I can come up with a valid plan despite these constraints, or if there's something else I'm missing.

I've been thinking in circles, so let me try to break down the problem differently:

I need to carefully think about the specific wording of the constraint: "If expression 'you are in front of blue_door_1' holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: 'you are holding some object'"

This is a conditional statement: IF A THEN B, where:
- A = "you are in front of blue_door_1"
- B = "at some earlier point, you were holding an object"

The key insight is that the constraint doesn't force me to ever be in front of blue_door_1. It only says that IF I ever am, THEN I must have previously held an object.

So I can either:
1. Never go in front of blue_door_1 (making the condition false, so the implication is satisfied)
2. Go in front of blue_door_1, but only after holding an object

But there's also the first constraint that says I must be in front of blue_door_1 at some point. So I must do option 2.

But again, I encounter the circular dependency:
- I need to pick up an object before going to blue_door_1
- All objects are in other rooms
- All doors are locked
- To unlock a door, I need to go in front of it and toggle it

Let me think more about the physical layout of the gridworld. The problem statement mentions a 2D gridworld with 4 rooms arranged in a square formation:
- room_1 (northwest)
- room_2 (southwest)
- room_3 (northeast)
- room_4 (southeast)

with doors connecting:
- room_1-room_2 (blue_door_1)
- room_1-room_3 (blue_door_2)
- room_2-room_4 (yellow_door_1)
- room_3-room_4 (purple_door_1)

I need to get to room_2 or room_4 to access yellow_door_1. To do this, I need to unlock at least one door.

Let me have another look at the drop action's preconditions: "you may only drop an object x if (i) you are currently holding x, and (ii) the position in front of you is empty."

I'm struggling to find a solution because all objects are in rooms 2 and 4, but to get there, I need to unlock a door, which means going in front of a door. But to go in front of blue_door_1, I need to have previously held an object.

Could the problem be that there's no valid solution? Let's try once more:

Actually, I notice that the first constraint says "you are in front of blue_door_1" must hold in at least one state. It doesn't say this has to be the first time I go to blue_door_1.

Let me try this plan:
1. Go to blue_door_2 (not blue_door_1)
2. Toggle blue_door_2 to unlock it
3. Go to room_3
4. Go to purple_door_1
5. Toggle purple_door_1 to unlock it
6. Go to room_4
7. Pick up an object in room_4
8. Go back to room_3
9. Go to room_1
10. Now go to blue_door_1 (satisfying both constraints because I've held an object)
11. Toggle blue_door_1 to unlock it
12. Go to room_2
13. Go to yellow_door_1
14. Toggle yellow_door_1 to unlock it
15. The goal is achieved: I'm in front of an unlocked yellow_door_1

This plan should work! Let me verify it step by step:

1. gotodoor blue_door_2 room_1 room_3
2. toggle blue_door_2
3. gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_2
4. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_4
5. toggle purple_door_1
6. gotoroom room_3 room_4 purple_door_1
7. gotoobject green_ball_1 room_4
8. pick green_ball_1 room_4
9. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_3
10. gotoroom room_4 room_3 purple_door_1
11. gotodoor blue_door_2 room_3 room_1
12. gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_2
13. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2 (satisfying both constraints)
14. toggle blue_door_1
15. gotoroom room_1 room_2 blue_door_1
16. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_4
17. toggle yellow_door_1
18. We're now in front of an unlocked yellow_door_1, achieving the goal

This should satisfy all constraints and achieve the goal. Let me double-check:

Constraint 1: "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'you are in front of blue_door_1'"
- Satisfied in step 13

Constraint 2: "If expression 'you are in front of blue_door_1' holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: 'you are holding some object'"
- Satisfied because I pick up green_ball_1 in step 8, before going in front of blue_door_1 in step 13

Goal: "There is a door d such that 'The following conditions are all true: "d is yellow", "room_4 and room_2 are connected via d", "you are in front of d", "d is not locked"'"
- Satisfied after step 17: I'm in front of yellow_door_1, which connects rooms 2 and 4, and I've just unlocked it

The plan is valid and satisfies all constraints!

Wait, I just realized that I can formulate a shorter plan by going from room_4 directly to room_2 after unlocking yellow_door_1, instead of going through rooms 3 and 1. Let me revise:

1. gotodoor blue_door_2 room_1 room_3
2. toggle blue_door_2
3. gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_2
4. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_4
5. toggle purple_door_1
6. gotoroom room_3 room_4 purple_door_1
7. gotoobject green_ball_1 room_4
8. pick green_ball_1 room_4
9. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_2
10. toggle yellow_door_1
11. gotoroom room_4 room_2 yellow_door_1
12. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1
13. toggle blue_door_1
14. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_4
15. We're now in front of an unlocked yellow_door_1, achieving the goal

Wait, this doesn't work because I need to be in front of blue_door_1 at some point, and in this revised plan, I'm never in front of blue_door_1 from room_1's side.

Actually, do I need to toggle blue_door_1? The goal only mentions being in front of an unlocked yellow_door_1, not using blue_door_1. But constraint 1 does require being in front of blue_door_1 at some point.

Let me try a different approach:

1. gotodoor blue_door_2 room_1 room_3
2. toggle blue_door_2
3. gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_2
4. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_4
5. toggle purple_door_1
6. gotoroom room_3 room_4 purple_door_1
7. gotoobject green_ball_1 room_4
8. pick green_ball_1 room_4
9. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_2
10. toggle yellow_door_1
11. gotoroom room_4 room_2 yellow_door_1
12. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1 (satisfying both constraints)
13. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_4
14. We're now in front of an unlocked yellow_door_1, achieving the goal

This plan works. Let me verify it step by step:

Constraint 1: "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'you are in front of blue_door_1'"
- Satisfied in step 12

Constraint 2: "If expression 'you are in front of blue_door_1' holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: 'you are holding some object'"
- Satisfied because I pick up green_ball_1 in step 8, before going in front of blue_door_1 in step 12

Goal: "There is a door d such that 'The following conditions are all true: "d is yellow", "room_4 and room_2 are connected via d", "you are in front of d", "d is not locked"'"
- Satisfied after step 14: I'm in front of yellow_door_1, which connects rooms 2 and 4, and I unlocked it in step 10

The plan is valid and satisfies all constraints. Let me check if there's an even shorter solution:

Actually I don't think we can significantly shorten this plan much further as we need to:
1. Get an object (which requires unlocking doors to reach either room_2 or room_4)
2. Go in front of blue_door_1 (after holding an object)
3. End up in front of an unlocked yellow_door_1

The plan I outlined uses the minimum number of steps to satisfy these requirements.

So here's the final plan:

```
gotodoor blue_door_2 room_1 room_3
toggle blue_door_2
gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_2
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_4
toggle purple_door_1
gotoroom room_3 room_4 purple_door_1
gotoobject green_ball_1 room_4
pick green_ball_1 room_4
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_2
toggle yellow_door_1
gotoroom room_4 room_2 yellow_door_1
gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_4
```

Wait, I realized there's one more optimization. The goal specifies that we need to be in front of yellow_door_1 and it should be unlocked. We don't explicitly need to be in room_2. So we could be in room_4, in front of yellow_door_1, and it would still satisfy the goal.

Here's the optimized plan:

1. gotodoor blue_door_2 room_1 room_3
2. toggle blue_door_2
3. gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_2
4. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_4
5. toggle purple_door_1
6. gotoroom room_3 room_4 purple_door_1
7. gotoobject green_ball_1 room_4
8. pick green_ball_1 room_4
9. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_2
10. toggle yellow_door_1
11. gotoroom room_4 room_2 yellow_door_1
12. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1 (satisfying both constraints)
13. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_4
14. We're now in front of an unlocked yellow_door_1, achieving the goal

But I realize we've gone back and forth on the same solution and verified it multiple times. I'm confident this is the optimal solution. So here's the final answer.

Wait, I realized one more thing. In this plan I went to room_2 on my way to satisfying the blue_door_1 constraint, but I actually need to verify that the goal of being in front of an unlocked yellow_door_1 is still satisfied at the end. 

Let me check the effects of the "gotodoor" action: "After performing this action regarding a door d, (i) if you were in front of some object or door x0, then you are no longer in front of x0 and (ii) you are in front of door d."

This means that after step 12 (going to blue_door_1), I'm no longer in front of yellow_door_1. I need to add an additional step to go back to yellow_door_1 in order to satisfy the goal. 

Actually, I'm in room_2 at step 12, and I go to blue_door_1, so I'm in front of blue_door_1 connecting room_2 and room_1. Then in step 13, I go to yellow_door_1, which connects room_2 and room_4, so I'm in front of yellow_door_1. This is correct.

But I want to double-check this plan one more time to make sure it's optimal and valid:

1. gotodoor blue_door_2 room_1 room_3
2. toggle blue_door_2
3. gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_2
4. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_4
5. toggle purple_door_1
6. gotoroom room_3 room_4 purple_door_1
7. gotoobject green_ball_1 room_4
8. pick green_ball_1 room_4
9. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_2
10. toggle yellow_door_1
11. gotoroom room_4 room_2 yellow_door_1
12. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1 (satisfying both constraints)
13. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_4
14. We're now in front of an unlocked yellow_door_1 from room_2's side, satisfying the goal

But I realize that my step 13 is problematic. After step 12, I'm in front of blue_door_1 on room_2's side. If I execute "gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_4" as step 13, I'll be in front of yellow_door_1 on room_2's side.

So the final plan should be:

1. gotodoor blue_door_2 room_1 room_3
2. toggle blue_door_2
3. gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_2
4. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_4
5. toggle purple_door_1
6. gotoroom room_3 room_4 purple_door_1
7. gotoobject green_ball_1 room_4
8. pick green_ball_1 room_4
9. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_2
10. toggle yellow_door_1
11. gotoroom room_4 room_2 yellow_door_1
12. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1 (satisfying both constraints)
13. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_4
14. We're now in front of an unlocked yellow_door_1, achieving the goal

This plan is valid and optimal, given the constraints.
