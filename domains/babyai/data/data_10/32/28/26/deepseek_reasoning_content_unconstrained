Okay, let's see. The goal is to have a yellow ball in front of me. The initial state says I'm in room_2, and there's yellow_ball_1 here. Wait, but the actions require me to pick up or drop objects, but the goal is just to be in front of a yellow ball. So maybe I can just go to the yellow_ball_1 in room_2. But first, I need to check if there are any obstacles or locked doors preventing me from doing that.

Wait, the initial state says I'm in room_2. The yellow_ball_1 is in room_2. So maybe I can directly use the "gotoobject" action. But let's check the preconditions for "gotoobject x r". The precondition is that I'm in the same room as x. Since I'm already in room_2 and the ball is here, that's satisfied. So the action would be "gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2". Then I'm in front of it, which meets the goal. But wait, are there any constraints or other issues?

Wait, the problem mentions constraints. Let me check the constraints part. Oh, the user mentioned "A valid plan for the abovementioned problem must abide by the following constraints:" but then there's nothing listed. Maybe that's a formatting error. Or perhaps the original problem had constraints that weren't copied here. Hmm. Since the user didn't specify any constraints beyond the initial problem description, maybe there are none. So maybe the solution is straightforward.

But wait, the initial state says all doors are locked. So if I need to move between rooms, I'd have to unlock doors. But since the yellow_ball_1 is already in room_2 where I am, maybe I don't need to move. So the plan would be:

1. gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2

That's it. Because after that action, I'm in front of the yellow ball, which satisfies the goal. Let me verify the preconditions.

- Precondition for "gotoobject": I must be in the same room as the object. Yes, I'm in room_2, and the ball is there. Also, the action's effect is that I'm in front of the object, and no longer in front of anything else. Since initially, I'm not in front of anything, after this action, I am. So that should work.

But wait, the initial state says "you have visited room_2". So that's just part of the initial state. Doesn't affect the current position. So yes, the action is valid. Therefore, the optimal plan is just that single action.
