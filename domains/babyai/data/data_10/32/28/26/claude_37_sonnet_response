Alright, I have a planning problem to solve. Let me break down the initial state and goal, as well as the constraints, to understand what I need to do.

**Initial State:**
- I'm in room_2.
- There are several objects, including yellow_ball_1, grey_box_1, yellow_box_1, and grey_box_2 in room_2.
- All doors (blue_door_1, blue_door_2, blue_door_3, green_door_1) are locked.
- Room_2 and room_1 are connected via blue_door_1.
- Room_1 and room_3 are connected via blue_door_2.
- Room_4 and room_2 are connected via blue_door_3.
- Room_4 and room_3 are connected via green_door_1.
- I'm not holding any object.
- I have visited room_2.

**Goal:**
- I need to be in front of a yellow ball.

**Constraints:**
- At least once during my plan, I need to be holding some object.

**Available Objects:**
- Yellow Balls: yellow_ball_1 (in room_2), yellow_ball_2 (in room_3)
- Grey Boxes: grey_box_1 (in room_2), grey_box_2 (in room_2)
- Yellow Box: yellow_box_1 (in room_2)
- Green Box: green_box_1 (in room_3)
- Purple Ball: purple_ball_1 (in room_4)
- Blue Ball: blue_ball_1 (in room_4)

Since I'm already in room_2, and yellow_ball_1 is also in room_2, I can simply go to that ball and pick it up to satisfy the constraint that I need to be holding some object. Then I can drop the ball and go in front of it to satisfy the goal.

Let me try to formulate a plan:

1. "gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2" - Go to yellow_ball_1 in room_2.
2. "pick yellow_ball_1 room_2" - Pick up yellow_ball_1 to satisfy the constraint.
3. "gotoempty" - Go to an empty position.
4. "drop yellow_ball_1 room_2" - Drop yellow_ball_1.
5. "gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2" - Go to yellow_ball_1 to satisfy the goal.

Actually, I realized that the goal says "There is a ball v such that "The following conditions are all true: "v is yellow", "you are in front of v"". This means that any yellow ball will do, not just yellow_ball_1. I'm already in room_2, and yellow_ball_1 is in room_2, so it's simplest to use that one.

Let's check if this plan satisfies both the goal and the constraint:

Goal: Be in front of a yellow ball. 
After step 5, I am in front of yellow_ball_1, which is a yellow ball, satisfying the goal.

Constraint: At some point, I need to be holding some object. 
After step 2, I am holding yellow_ball_1, which satisfies the constraint.

There's one more thing to ensure: I need to start and end the plan with a valid action. Let's check:

1. "gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2":
   - Precondition: I need to be in the same room as yellow_ball_1. I am in room_2, and yellow_ball_1 is in room_2, so this is valid.

2. "pick yellow_ball_1 room_2":
   - Preconditions: I need to be in the same room as yellow_ball_1 and I need to not be holding any object. Both conditions are met, so this is valid.

3. "gotoempty":
   - Precondition: None. This is valid.

4. "drop yellow_ball_1 room_2":
   - Preconditions: I need to be holding yellow_ball_1, and I need to be in front of an empty position. After step 3, I am in front of an empty position, and I'm holding yellow_ball_1, so this is valid.

5. "gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2":
   - Precondition: I need to be in the same room as yellow_ball_1. After dropping yellow_ball_1 in room_2, yellow_ball_1 is in room_2, and I am also in room_2, so this is valid.

The plan seems to be valid and efficient. Let me see if there's an even simpler solution. Actually, I think this is as simple as it gets, since I need to satisfy the constraint of holding an object at some point, and I need to end in front of a yellow ball.

So the final plan is:

1. "gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2"
2. "pick yellow_ball_1 room_2"
3. "gotoempty"
4. "drop yellow_ball_1 room_2"
5. "gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2"

Let me double-check if this plan is indeed optimal.

wait, I'm not sure if I need all these steps. The goal is just to be in front of a yellow ball, and there's a constraint that I need to be holding an object at some point.

Actually, I don't think I need to drop the yellow_ball_1. I could just: 

1. "gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2"
2. "pick yellow_ball_1 room_2"
3. "gotoempty"
4. "drop yellow_ball_1 room_2"
5. "gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2"

but actually, I don't think I need to drop the ball and then go back to it. Specifically, the constraint is "At some point, I need to be holding some object" but that doesn't mean I need to stop holding the object, does it?

Let's re-read the goal: "There is a ball v such that "The following conditions are all true: "v is yellow", "you are in front of v""". 

"you are in front of v" means I need to be in front of a yellow ball. After I pick up the yellow ball, I'm no longer in front of it (I'm holding it). So I do need to drop the ball to be in front of it again.

Actually, I'm not sure if I misunderstood the goal. Let me re-read it more carefully. The goal is to be in front of some yellow ball.

There are two yellow balls:
- yellow_ball_1 in room_2
- yellow_ball_2 in room_3

I'm currently in room_2, where yellow_ball_1 is. There's also yellow_ball_2 in room_3, but to get there I would need to unlock doors, which seems more complex. So I should aim to be in front of yellow_ball_1.

After "pick yellow_ball_1 room_2", I'm holding yellow_ball_1 and I'm no longer in front of it. So, I need to drop it somewhere and then go back to it to be in front of it.

So I do need all the steps I specified:

1. "gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2"
2. "pick yellow_ball_1 room_2"
3. "gotoempty"
4. "drop yellow_ball_1 room_2"
5. "gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2"

Actually, since I need to be holding an object at some point to satisfy the constraint but I can pick any object, I could pick a different object instead, and just go to the yellow ball in the end. But that would still require me to pick, drop, and go to the yellow ball, which is the same number of steps.

I think the above plan is optimal for solving the problem. Let's go with it.

1. "gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2"
2. "pick yellow_ball_1 room_2"
3. "gotoempty"
4. "drop yellow_ball_1 room_2"
5. "gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2"
