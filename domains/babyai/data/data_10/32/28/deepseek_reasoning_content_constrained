Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. So, the goal is to have a red ball in front of me, and I need to be in front of it. The constraints are that at some point, the red_door_1 must be unlocked and I'm in front of green_door_3. Let's start by understanding the initial state and the steps needed.

First, the agent starts in room_1. There are red_ball_1 and yellow_ball_1 here. But the problem is that all doors are locked. The doors are green_door_1 (connecting room_1 and room_2), green_door_2 (connecting room_1 and room_3), green_door_3 (connecting room_2 and room_4), and red_door_1 (connecting room_3 and room_4). All doors are locked initially.

The goal is to have a red ball in front of me. The available red balls are red_ball_1 in room_1 and red_ball_2 in room_2. So, either of these could be the target. However, to get to red_ball_2 in room_2, I need to go through green_door_1 from room_1, but that door is locked. Similarly, green_door_2 is locked, which connects to room_3. So, the first challenge is unlocking a door to move between rooms.

But the constraints require that in some state, red_door_1 is unlocked and I'm in front of green_door_3. Let's break that down. Red_door_1 is between room_3 and room_4. To unlock it, I need to toggle it, which requires being in front of it. But to get there, I need to reach room_3 or room_4. However, all initial doors from room_1 are locked. Wait, how can I move? Unless there's a way to unlock a door from room_1. Let's see.

Looking at the doors connected to room_1: green_door_1 (to room_2) and green_door_2 (to room_3). Both are locked. So, I can't leave room_1 unless I unlock one of these doors. But to unlock a door, I need to toggle it, which requires being in front of it. So, first, I need to go to the door in the current room. For example, in room_1, green_door_1 is connecting to room_2. So, I can 'goto door green_door_1 room_1 room_2' if I'm in room_1. Wait, but the precondition for gotodoor is that I'm in a room connected by that door. Since I'm in room_1, which is connected via green_door_1 to room_2, that's okay. But also, there must be no object blocking the position in front of the door. Are there any objects blocking doors in the initial state?

In room_1, the objects are red_ball_1 and yellow_ball_1. Are they blocking any doors? The problem statement mentions that objects can block doors. However, the initial state doesn't state any such blockages. Wait, the initial state says "you are in room_1", but there's no mention of objects blocking doors. So, perhaps doors are not blocked by objects by default. So, maybe I can go to the door.

So, the first steps might be:

1. In room_1, goto green_door_1 (connecting to room_2). Since there's no blocking object, I can go there.
2. Toggle green_door_1 to unlock it.
3. Then use gotoroom to go from room_1 to room_2 via green_door_1.

Once in room_2, there's grey_box_1, purple_ball_1, red_ball_2, and green_box_1. Now, if the goal is to have a red ball in front, red_ball_2 is here. But maybe I need to pick it up and drop it again, but the goal just requires being in front of it. Wait, the goal is "There is a ball v such that v is red and you are in front of v". So, if I'm in front of red_ball_2 in room_2, that would satisfy the goal. But how do I get there? Also, the constraints require that at some point, red_door_1 is unlocked and I'm in front of green_door_3. So, perhaps the plan needs to include unlocking red_door_1 and being in front of green_door_3.

Wait, green_door_3 connects room_2 and room_4. To be in front of green_door_3, I need to be in room_2 or room_4. Let's say I go to room_2 first. From room_2, green_door_3 connects to room_4. So, I can go to green_door_3 in room_2. Then toggle it to unlock (but initially it's locked). Wait, the initial state says all green doors (1,2,3) are locked, and red_door_1 is locked. So, green_door_3 is locked. To unlock it, I need to be in front of it and toggle it. But why would I need to unlock red_door_1? Because the constraint requires that red_door_1 is not locked in at least one state. So, the plan must include unlocking red_door_1 at some point.

So, to meet the constraint, I need to unlock red_door_1. But red_door_1 is between room_3 and room_4. So, to get there, I need to go through room_3 or room_4. Let's see possible paths.

If I can get to room_3 from room_1 by unlocking green_door_2. Or from room_2 to room_4 via green_door_3, then to room_4, then to room_3 via red_door_1. But red_door_1 is locked, so I need to unlock it. Let's outline possible steps:

Alternative path:

1. Start in room_1. Unlock green_door_2 (connecting to room_3) by going to it, toggling, then go to room_3. But to do that:

- goto door green_door_2 room_1 room_3 (since in room_1)
- toggle green_door_2 (unlocking it)
- gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_2

From room_3, can I reach red_door_1? Yes, red_door_1 connects room_3 and room_4. So, in room_3, go to red_door_1, toggle to unlock it. Then, perhaps go to room_4 via red_door_1. But also, the constraint requires being in front of green_door_3. Green_door_3 is in room_2 and room_4. So, if I can get to room_4, then go to green_door_3 from there. But how?

Alternatively, maybe the path involves going from room_2 to room_4 via green_door_3, but first unlocking green_door_3.

Wait, the constraint is that at some point, red_door_1 is not locked, and I'm in front of green_door_3. So, perhaps during the plan, after unlocking red_door_1, and then I go to green_door_3. Let's see.

So, possible steps:

1. In room_1, unlock green_door_1 (to room_2), go to room_2.

2. In room_2, unlock green_door_3 (to room_4), go to room_4.

3. In room_4, find green_ball_1 and grey_ball_1, but that's not helpful. Then go to red_door_1 (connecting room_4 to room_3). Unlock red_door_1 here (since in room_4, you can go to red_door_1, toggle it to unlock). Then, go to room_3 via red_door_1.

But how does this help with the goal? The goal is to be in front of a red ball. The red_ball_1 is in room_1, red_ball_2 in room_2. So, after moving around, perhaps I need to return to room_2 to get red_ball_2.

But let's think about the constraints. The plan must include a state where red_door_1 is unlocked and I'm in front of green_door_3. Green_door_3 is in room_2 and room_4. So, if I'm in room_4, and go to green_door_3 (from room_4's side), then while in front of green_door_3 (in room_4), if red_door_1 is unlocked, that satisfies the constraint. Or, if I'm in room_2, front of green_door_3, and red_door_1 is unlocked (but that might not happen unless the unlocking happens earlier).

Alternatively, the plan could be:

- Unlock green_door_1 in room_1, go to room_2.

- In room_2, go to green_door_3, unlock it.

- Then go to room_4 via green_door_3.

- In room_4, go to red_door_1, unlock it (toggle).

- Then, go to room_3 via red_door_1.

But how does this help with the goal? The goal is to have a red ball in front. Let's see, red_ball_2 is in room_2, red_ball_1 in room_1. So, maybe after unlocking doors, go back to room_2, pick up red_ball_2, drop it in front of me.

Wait, but the goal is just to be in front of a red ball. So, if I'm in front of red_ball_2 in room_2, that's sufficient. But how to get there? Let's see:

1. Start in room_1. The initial room has red_ball_1. But the doors are locked. So, can I use that ball? But to pick it up, I need to go to it, then pick. But after dropping, I need to be in front of it again. But the goal requires being in front of it. So, maybe:

- gotoobject red_ball_1 room_1

- pick red_ball_1 room_1

Then, drop it again. But after dropping, I'm in front of it. That would satisfy the goal. But wait, the constraints require that during the plan, at some point, red_door_1 is unlocked and I'm in front of green_door_3. So, maybe this approach skips that. So, that's a problem.

So, perhaps the agent has to first unlock red_door_1 and be in front of green_door_3, then handle the ball.

But how can the agent do both? Let's think.

The plan must include steps to unlock red_door_1 and be in front of green_door_3. Let's outline the steps needed for that.

To unlock red_door_1, the agent must be in front of it. Red_door_1 connects room_3 and room_4. So, the agent needs to be in either room_3 or room_4 to be in front of red_door_1. Then toggle it.

But to get to room_3 or room_4, the agent must first unlock doors. Let's consider:

From room_1, unlock green_door_1 (to room_2):

1. gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_2

2. toggle green_door_1 (now unlocked)

3. gotoroom room_1 room_2 green_door_1 (now in room_2)

In room_2, there's green_door_3 connecting to room_4. But it's locked. So:

4. gotodoor green_door_3 room_2 room_4

5. toggle green_door_3 (unlock)

6. gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_3 (now in room_4)

In room_4, the red_door_1 connects to room_3. So:

7. gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_3

8. toggle red_door_1 (unlock it)

Now, red_door_1 is unlocked. But the constraint requires that at some state, red_door_1 is unlocked and the agent is in front of green_door_3. When is the agent in front of green_door_3? That would be when they are in room_2 or room_4. For example, in step 4, after going to green_door_3 in room_2, they are in front of it. But at that time, red_door_1 is still locked. After step 8, red_door_1 is unlocked, but the agent is in room_4. So, to be in front of green_door_3 after unlocking red_door_1, the agent could go back to room_4's green_door_3.

Wait, green_door_3 connects room_2 and room_4. So, in room_4, the agent can go to green_door_3 (from room_4's side) by:

9. gotodoor green_door_3 room_4 room_2

Now, the agent is in front of green_door_3 (in room_4). At this point, red_door_1 is unlocked (step 8). So, this satisfies the constraint: red_door_1 is not locked, and agent is in front of green_door_3.

Then, the agent needs to achieve the goal of being in front of a red ball. The red balls are in room_1 and room_2. But the agent is currently in room_4. To get to room_2, they can go through green_door_3 (already unlocked). From room_4 to room_2 via green_door_3:

10. gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_3

Now in room_2, find red_ball_2.

11. gotoobject red_ball_2 room_2

Now, the agent is in front of red_ball_2, which is red. This satisfies the goal.

So the steps would be:

1. gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_2

2. toggle green_door_1

3. gotoroom room_1 room_2 green_door_1

4. gotodoor green_door_3 room_2 room_4

5. toggle green_door_3

6. gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_3

7. gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_3

8. toggle red_door_1

9. gotodoor green_door_3 room_4 room_2

10. gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_3

11. gotoobject red_ball_2 room_2

But wait, step 9 is gotodoor green_door_3 room_4 room_2. After that, step 10 is gotoroom to room_2. But perhaps after step 9, the agent is already in front of green_door_3 (room_4 side). Then, gotoroom to room_2. So, steps 9 and 10 are needed to be in front of green_door_3 while red_door_1 is unlocked.

Yes. So during step 9, the agent is in front of green_door_3 (room_4 side), and red_door_1 is unlocked (step 8). So, this satisfies the constraint. Then, moving back to room_2 and going to the red_ball_2.

So this plan would satisfy the goal and the constraint. Now, check if all preconditions are met.

Let's verify each step:

1. gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_2: in room_1, door connects to room_2. No blocking objects. Valid.

2. toggle green_door_1: after step 1, agent is in front of door. Toggle unlocks it.

3. gotoroom room_1 room_2 green_door_1: door is now unlocked. Move to room_2.

4. gotodoor green_door_3 room_2 room_4: in room_2, door connects to room_4. No blocking objects? The objects in room_2 are grey_box_1, purple_ball_1, red_ball_2, green_box_1. Are any of these blocking the door? The initial state doesn't mention any objects blocking doors, so assuming they don't. So, valid.

5. toggle green_door_3: unlock it.

6. gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_3: move to room_4.

7. gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_3: in room_4, door connects to room_3. No blocking objects.

8. toggle red_door_1: unlock it.

9. gotodoor green_door_3 room_4 room_2: in room_4, door connects to room_2. Valid.

10. gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_3: door is unlocked. Move back to room_2.

11. gotoobject red_ball_2 room_2: in room_2, so valid. Now in front of red_ball_2.

This sequence should meet all preconditions and the constraints. Now, check if this is the optimal (shortest possible) plan. Are there any unnecessary steps?

Alternative approach: After step 8 (unlocking red_door_1), can the agent go directly to room_2 via green_door_3 without step 9? Wait, step 9 is gotodoor green_door_3 in room_4. Then step 10 is gotoroom to room_2. But to move from room_4 to room_2 via green_door_3, the agent needs to be in front of green_door_3 in room_4. So steps 9 and 10 are necessary.

Is there a shorter path? For example, after unlocking red_door_1, can the agent go to room_3, then to room_1 via green_door_2, but that might not help. Let's see.

Another approach: After unlocking green_door_1, go to room_2. Then, go to red_ball_2 directly. But to unlock red_door_1 and be in front of green_door_3, the agent must do those steps. So the steps are necessary.

Alternatively, maybe unlock green_door_2 from room_1 to reach room_3, then unlock red_door_1 from room_3, and then go to room_4 and green_door_3. But that path may take more steps. Let's see:

Alternative plan:

1. gotodoor green_door_2 room_1 room_3

2. toggle green_door_2

3. gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_2

4. gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_4

5. toggle red_door_1 (now unlocked)

6. gotodoor green_door_3 ... wait, but green_door_3 is in room_2 and room_4. So, if agent is in room_3, can't reach green_door_3 directly. To get to green_door_3, need to go to room_4 via red_door_1.

So:

6. gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_1 (now in room_4)

7. gotodoor green_door_3 room_4 room_2 (now in front of green_door_3)

At this point, red_door_1 is unlocked (step 5), and agent is in front of green_door_3 (step7). So that satisfies the constraint. Then, proceed to room_2, goto red_ball_2.

8. gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_3

9. gotoobject red_ball_2 room_2

So that's 9 steps. Let's compare:

Original plan: 11 steps.

Alternative plan: 9 steps. So that's shorter. So maybe this is better.

Let's verify this alternative plan:

1. goto door green_door_2 room_1 room_3

2. toggle green_door_2 (unlock)

3. goto room_1 room_3 green_door_2 (now in room_3)

4. goto door red_door_1 room_3 room_4 (now in front of red_door_1)

5. toggle red_door_1 (unlock)

6. goto room_3 room_4 red_door_1 (now in room_4)

7. goto door green_door_3 room_4 room_2 (in front of green_door_3 in room_4)

At this step, red_door_1 is unlocked (step5) and agent is in front of green_door_3 (step7). So constraint is met.

8. goto room_4 room_2 green_door_3 (now in room_2)

9. gotoobject red_ball_2 room_2 (in front of red_ball_2)

This is 9 actions. So this is shorter. So this would be optimal.

But wait, does step7 require unlocking green_door_3? Because green_door_3 is locked initially, so to go from room_4 to room_2 via green_door_3, the door must be unlocked. But in the alternative plan, the agent is in room_4, and steps 7 is going to green_door_3. Then step8 is moving to room_2. But green_door_3 is initially locked. So the agent can't move through green_door_3 unless it's unlocked. So, in the alternative plan, after step6 (agent is in room_4), green_door_3 is still locked. So step8 would require the door to be unlocked. Therefore, in this alternative plan, the agent hasn't unlocked green_door_3, so step8 is not possible. So the plan is invalid.

Ah, that's a problem. Because in this alternative plan, when the agent is in room_4 and wants to go to room_2 via green_door_3, they need green_door_3 to be unlocked. But in the initial state, green_door_3 is locked, and in this plan, the agent hasn't toggled it. So step8 would fail.

Therefore, the alternative plan is invalid. Hence, the original plan must include unlocking green_door_3. Which brings us back to the original plan. So, the agent must unlock green_door_3 to move from room_2 to room_4. Therefore, the steps to unlock green_door_3 are necessary.

Therefore, the original plan of 11 steps is required. But let's check again.

Wait, in the first plan, after unlocking green_door_1 and moving to room_2, then unlock green_door_3, move to room_4, unlock red_door_1, then go back to green_door_3 in room_4, then move to room_2. But green_door_3 is already unlocked by step5. So when the agent is in room_4 and wants to go to room_2 via green_door_3, the door is unlocked. So step10 (goto room_4 to room_2 via green_door_3) is allowed.

So, in the first plan, steps:

1. gotodoor green_door_1 (room_1 to room_2)

2. toggle (unlock)

3. goto room_2

4. gotodoor green_door_3 (room_2 to room_4)

5. toggle (unlock)

6. goto room_4

7. gotodoor red_door_1 (room_4 to room_3)

8. toggle (unlock)

9. gotodoor green_door_3 (room_4 side)

10. goto room_2 via green_door_3

11. goto red_ball_2

This sequence works, and the constraint is met during step9 and step8 (after step8, red_door_1 is unlocked, and during step9, agent is in front of green_door_3). So step9 is after step8, so in that state, both conditions hold.

So this plan is valid and has 11 steps. But can we make it shorter?

Wait, after step8 (toggle red_door_1 in room4), the agent is in room4. To be in front of green_door_3 in room4, they need to do gotodoor green_door_3 room4 room2 (step9). Then, to move to room2 (step10), which is allowed. So steps9 and 10 are necessary. Then step11 is gotoobject.

Alternatively, after step8, the agent is in room4. Can they instead go to green_door_3, which is in room4, then move to room2 via green_door_3. Then, in room2, goto red_ball_2. That would require steps:

After step8 (unlock red_door_1), step9: gotodoor green_door_3 room4 room2.

Step10: gotoroom room4 room2 green_door_3.

Step11: gotoobject red_ball_2 room2.

But the constraint is met during step9 and step8. So yes. So that's 11 steps. Is there a way to merge some steps?

Wait, after step5 (unlock green_door_3), step6 is gotoroom room2 room4. Then step7 is gotodoor red_door_1, step8 toggle. Then step9 gotodoor green_door_3 in room4. Then step10 gotoroom to room2. step11 gotoobject.

Is there a way to avoid step9? For example, after step8, can the agent directly move to room2 via green_door_3 without first going to the door? No, because to use gotoroom, you have to be in the room connected by the door. But the agent is in room4, so to move via green_door_3 to room2, they can do it without needing to first goto the door. Wait, the gotoroom action requires that the door is unlocked, which it is (step5), but the agent can be anywhere in the room. Wait, the gotoroom action's precondition is that you are in a room adjacent via the door, and the door is unlocked. So, in room4, to go to room2 via green_door_3, the door is unlocked, so you can perform gotoroom room4 room2 green_door_3 regardless of where you are in room4. So, perhaps step9 (gotodoor) is unnecessary. Let's check:

The effect of gotoroom is that you leave the previous room, enter the new room, and are no longer in front of any object. So, after step8, the agent is in room4, not in front of anything. Then, step9 can be skipped. So, step9 is gotoroom room4 room2 green_door_3. Which is allowed because green_door_3 is unlocked, and the agent is in room4. So, after step8:

8. toggle red_door_1 (now unlocked)

9. gotoroom room4 room2 green_door_3 (move to room2)

At this point, the agent is in room2. Now, the constraint requires that in some state, red_door_1 is unlocked and the agent is in front of green_door_3. But in this scenario, after step9, the agent is in room2, not in front of green_door_3. However, during step8, the agent is in front of red_door_1 (room4) and after step8, red_door_1 is unlocked. To be in front of green_door_3, the agent needs to be in front of it either in room2 or room4. So, if the agent moves from room4 to room2 via green_door_3 (step9), then during that action, they were in front of green_door_3 in room4. But the gotoroom action requires that you are not in front of any door when you move. Wait, the effect of gotoroom is that you are no longer in front of any object or door. So, during the movement, the agent is not in front of the door. Therefore, the state after step8 is that the agent is in room4, in front of red_door_1 (from step7). After step8 (toggle), they are still in front of red_door_1. Then, step9 is gotoroom, which moves them to room2. But before moving, they are in front of red_door_1? Or not?

Wait, after step7: gotodoor red_door_1 room4 room3 (agent is now in front of red_door_1). Step8: toggle red_door_1 (unlock). Then step9: gotoroom room4 room2 green_door_3. But for gotoroom, you need to be in the room connected by the door. But you are in room4. The door green_door_3 connects room2 and room4. So, the agent is in room4, door green_door_3 is unlocked. So, the agent can perform gotoroom room4 room2 green_door_3, but the precondition is that you are in room4 (adjacent to room2 via green_door_3) and the door is unlocked. But you don't need to be in front of the door to use gotoroom. Wait, the gotoroom action's precondition is: you are in a room r0 adjacent to r via door d, and the door is unlocked. So, the agent can be anywhere in room4 and use gotoroom to move to room2 via green_door_3, as long as the door is unlocked. So, they don't need to be in front of the door. So, the steps could be:

After step8 (toggle red_door_1), the agent is in room4, in front of red_door_1. But to move to room2 via green_door_3, they can directly do gotoroom room4 room2 green_door_3. So, step9 would be that. But during this step, they are in room4, and the door is unlocked. But they are not in front of green_door_3. So, when would they be in front of green_door_3? They need to have a step where they are in front of green_door_3 (room4 or room2) and red_door_1 is unlocked.

In this case, after step8, red_door_1 is unlocked, but the agent is in front of red_door_1. Then, step9 is moving to room2 via green_door_3. But during step9, they are not in front of green_door_3. So, the constraint isn't met. Therefore, the agent must have a step where they are in front of green_door_3 while red_door_1 is unlocked.

Thus, the original plan's step9 (gotodoor green_door_3 room4 room2) is necessary to be in front of green_door_3. Then, step10 moves to room2. So during step9, agent is in front of green_door_3 (room4 side) and red_door_1 is unlocked. That satisfies the constraint.

Therefore, steps9 and 10 are necessary.

Thus, the plan with 11 steps is needed. Now, is there any way to shorten this?

Wait, after step8 (toggle red_door_1), can the agent do the following:

9. gotodoor green_door_3 room4 room2 (now in front of green_door_3)

10. gotoempty (to get away from the door?)

Wait, but why? Because after step9, the agent is in front of green_door_3. The constraint requires that in at least one state, red_door_1 is unlocked and agent is in front of green_door_3. So during step9, red_door_1 is unlocked (step8), and agent is in front of green_door_3. So that meets the constraint. Then, steps10 and 11 are moving to room2 and gotoobject. So steps9-11 are:

9. gotodoor green_door_3 room4 room2

10. gotoroom room4 room2 green_door_3

11. gotoobject red_ball_2 room2

Thus, total steps are 11. I think that's the minimal plan.

Alternatively, can the agent, after step9, stay in front of green_door_3 and have the goal met? The goal requires being in front of a red ball. So, if the agent can drop a red ball in front of themselves in room4, but that requires carrying one. The red balls in room4 are grey_ball_1 and green_ball_1, which are not red. So, no. The agent must return to room2 to be in front of red_ball_2.

Thus, the plan with 11 steps is necessary. Now, let's check if all steps are valid.

Step1: gotodoor green_door_1 room1 room2: valid.

Step2: toggle: door is now unlocked.

Step3: gotoroom to room2: valid.

Step4: gotodoor green_door_3 room2 room4: valid.

Step5: toggle: unlock.

Step6: gotoroom to room4.

Step7: gotodoor red_door_1 room4 room3: valid.

Step8: toggle: unlock.

Step9: gotodoor green_door_3 room4 room2: valid.

Step10: gotoroom to room2.

Step11: gotoobject red_ball_2 room2: valid.

Yes, all steps are valid. So this is the plan.
