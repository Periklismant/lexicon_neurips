Alright, I need to plan a sequence of actions to achieve the given goal while satisfying the constraints.

First, let me understand the goal:
- I need to find a state where I'm in front of a red ball.

The constraint is:
- At some point, I need to be in front of green_door_3 and red_door_1 should be unlocked.

Let's look at the initial state:
- I am in room_1.
- There's a red ball (red_ball_1) in room_1.
- There's another red ball (red_ball_2) in room_2.
- All doors are locked.

To satisfy the goal, I can be in front of either red_ball_1 in room_1 or red_ball_2 in room_2. Since I'm already in room_1, it seems more efficient to use red_ball_1.

To satisfy the constraint, I need to:
1. Unlock red_door_1 at some point.
2. Be in front of green_door_3 at some point, with red_door_1 being unlocked.

Let's think about the most efficient path to achieve both the goal and constraint:

1. First, I'll go to red_ball_1 in room_1 (which satisfies the goal).
2. Then, I need to unlock red_door_1. For this, I need to be in front of red_door_1, which is between room_3 and room_4. This means I need to go to either of these rooms.
3. To go to room_3 from room_1, I need to unlock green_door_2.
4. After I'm in room_3, I can go to red_door_1 and unlock it.
5. Then, I need to be in front of green_door_3 which is between room_2 and room_4. So, I need to be in either of these rooms.
6. Given my current position, it seems more efficient to go from room_3 to room_4 (through the now unlocked red_door_1). From room_4, I can go to green_door_3.

Let's plan the actions step by step:

1. In room_1, go to red_ball_1.
   `gotoobject red_ball_1 room_1`
   
This satisfies the first goal.

Now, for the constraint:

2. Go to green_door_2 in room_1.
   `gotodoor green_door_2 room_1 room_3`
   
3. Unlock green_door_2.
   `toggle green_door_2`
   
4. Go to room_3.
   `gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_2`
   
5. Go to red_door_1 in room_3.
   `gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_4`
   
6. Unlock red_door_1.
   `toggle red_door_1`
   
7. Go to room_4.
   `gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_1`
   
8. Go to green_door_3 in room_4.
   `gotodoor green_door_3 room_4 room_2`
   
At this point, I'm in front of green_door_3 and red_door_1 is unlocked. This satisfies the constraint.

Let me double-check if all the actions are valid and if I'm missing anything:

In the initial state, I'm in room_1, and all doors are locked. I need to go to red_ball_1 to satisfy the goal, and then navigate to be in front of green_door_3 with red_door_1 unlocked to satisfy the constraint.

I think my plan is fine. Let's list out the sequence of actions that I've determined:

```
gotoobject red_ball_1 room_1
gotodoor green_door_2 room_1 room_3
toggle green_door_2
gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_2
gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_4
toggle red_door_1
gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_1
gotodoor green_door_3 room_4 room_2
```

Hmm, wait, I think I misunderstood what the constraint meant. It states:
"The following expression must hold in at least one state: 
'The following conditions are all true: "red_door_1 is not locked", "you are in front of green_door_3"'".

This means that at some point in the plan, I should be in front of green_door_3 while red_door_1 is unlocked. My plan above does achieve this, but let me double-check if it's the most efficient way.

Actually, there's an optimization I can make. After unlocking red_door_1, I can go directly to room_4 and then to green_door_3.

Actually, no, my existing plan is already optimized for this. After unlocking red_door_1, I go to room_4 and then to green_door_3. Let's keep this plan.

Actually, I think I'm still misunderstanding the goal. Let me re-examine it.

The goal is:
"There is a ball v such that "The following conditions are all true: "v is red", "you are in front of v"".

So, I need to be in front of a red ball, which can be either red_ball_1 in room_1 or red_ball_2 in room_2. My original plan goes to red_ball_1 in the first step, which satisfies this goal.

Let me trace through the actions again:

1. `gotoobject red_ball_1 room_1` - At this point, I'm in front of red_ball_1, which is red. This satisfies the goal.

The constraint is: At some point, red_door_1 should be unlocked and I should be in front of green_door_3.

To achieve this:
1. From my current position in front of red_ball_1 in room_1, I go to green_door_2.
   `gotodoor green_door_2 room_1 room_3`
2. I unlock green_door_2.
   `toggle green_door_2`
3. I go to room_3.
   `gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_2`
4. I go to red_door_1 in room_3.
   `gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_4`
5. I unlock red_door_1.
   `toggle red_door_1`
6. I go to room_4.
   `gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_1`
7. I go to green_door_3 in room_4.
   `gotodoor green_door_3 room_4 room_2`

At this point, I'm in front of green_door_3 and red_door_1 is unlocked. This satisfies the constraint.

But, I think there is a more efficient route:

1. From my current position in front of red_ball_1 in room_1, I go to green_door_1.
   `gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_2`
2. I unlock green_door_1.
   `toggle green_door_1`
3. I go to room_2.
   `gotoroom room_1 room_2 green_door_1`
4. I go to green_door_3 in room_2.
   `gotodoor green_door_3 room_2 room_4`
5. I unlock green_door_3.
   `toggle green_door_3`
6. I go to room_4.
   `gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_3`
7. I go to red_door_1 in room_4.
   `gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_3`
8. I unlock red_door_1.
   `toggle red_door_1`
9. I go to green_door_3 in room_4.
   `gotodoor green_door_3 room_4 room_2`

Actually, this second route is longer and still doesn't satisfy the goal and constraint together.

I realize I've been overthinking this. The crucial point is that the door red_door_1 must be unlocked, and I must be in front of green_door_3 at some state.

Let's try a more straightforward approach:

1. `gotoobject red_ball_1 room_1`: This satisfies the goal of being in front of a red ball.
2. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_2`: Go to green_door_1.
3. `toggle green_door_1`: Unlock green_door_1.
4. `gotoroom room_1 room_2 green_door_1`: Go to room_2.
5. `gotodoor green_door_3 room_2 room_4`: Go to green_door_3 in room_2.
6. `toggle green_door_3`: Unlock green_door_3.
7. `gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_3`: Go to room_4.
8. `gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_3`: Go to red_door_1 in room_4.
9. `toggle red_door_1`: Unlock red_door_1.
10. `gotodoor green_door_3 room_4 room_2`: Go back to green_door_3 in room_4.

After step 10, I'm in front of green_door_3 and red_door_1 is unlocked. This satisfies the constraint. The goal of being in front of a red ball is satisfied in step 1.

Actually, I can also pursue another goal where I'm in front of red_ball_2 in room_2.

Let's consider an alternative approach:

1. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_2`: Go to green_door_1 in room_1.
2. `toggle green_door_1`: Unlock green_door_1.
3. `gotoroom room_1 room_2 green_door_1`: Go to room_2.
4. `gotoobject red_ball_2 room_2`: Go to red_ball_2. This satisfies the goal of being in front of a red ball.
5. `gotodoor green_door_3 room_2 room_4`: Go to green_door_3 in room_2.
6. `toggle green_door_3`: Unlock green_door_3.
7. `gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_3`: Go to room_4.
8. `gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_3`: Go to red_door_1 in room_4.
9. `toggle red_door_1`: Unlock red_door_1.
10. `gotodoor green_door_3 room_4 room_2`: Go back to green_door_3 in room_4.

This approach is also viable. However, it's the same length as the previous one.

Now, let me see if there's an even more efficient approach. The constraint is: "At some point, be in front of green_door_3 with red_door_1 unlocked."

Red_door_1 connects room_3 and room_4. Green_door_3 connects room_2 and room_4.

1. `gotodoor green_door_2 room_1 room_3`: Go to green_door_2 in room_1.
2. `toggle green_door_2`: Unlock green_door_2.
3. `gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_2`: Go to room_3.
4. `gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_4`: Go to red_door_1 in room_3.
5. `toggle red_door_1`: Unlock red_door_1.
6. `gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_1`: Go to room_4.
7. `gotodoor green_door_3 room_4 room_2`: Go to green_door_3 in room_4.

At this point, I'm in front of green_door_3 with red_door_1 unlocked. Now, I need to satisfy the goal of being in front of a red ball. The closest red ball is red_ball_2 in room_2.

8. `toggle green_door_3`: Unlock green_door_3.
9. `gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_3`: Go to room_2.
10. `gotoobject red_ball_2 room_2`: Go to red_ball_2. This satisfies the goal of being in front of a red ball.

This approach has the same number of steps as the other two approaches.

Actually, since the constraint doesn't require green_door_3 to be unlocked, just to be in front of it, I can save one step:

1. `gotodoor green_door_2 room_1 room_3`: Go to green_door_2 in room_1.
2. `toggle green_door_2`: Unlock green_door_2.
3. `gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_2`: Go to room_3.
4. `gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_4`: Go to red_door_1 in room_3.
5. `toggle red_door_1`: Unlock red_door_1.
6. `gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_1`: Go to room_4.
7. `gotodoor green_door_3 room_4 room_2`: Go to green_door_3 in room_4.
8. `gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_3`: Go to room_2. (Hmm, but I can't do this since the door is locked).
9. `toggle green_door_3`: Unlock green_door_3.
10. `gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_3`: Go to room_2.
11. `gotoobject red_ball_2 room_2`: Go to red_ball_2. This satisfies the goal of being in front of a red ball.

So this approach is actually longer.

Let's consider another approach:

1. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_2`: Go to green_door_1 in room_1.
2. `toggle green_door_1`: Unlock green_door_1.
3. `gotoroom room_1 room_2 green_door_1`: Go to room_2.
4. `gotodoor green_door_3 room_2 room_4`: Go to green_door_3 in room_2.

Even if I unlock `green_door_3` now, I still need to get to room_4 to access red_door_1. And to satisfy the constraint, I need to be in front of green_door_3 when red_door_1 is unlocked, not just after I unlock green_door_3.

Actually, there's a more straightforward approach:

1. `gotoobject red_ball_1 room_1`: This satisfies the goal of being in front of a red ball.
2. `gotodoor green_door_2 room_1 room_3`: Go to green_door_2 in room_1.
3. `toggle green_door_2`: Unlock green_door_2.
4. `gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_2`: Go to room_3.
5. `gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_4`: Go to red_door_1 in room_3.
6. `toggle red_door_1`: Unlock red_door_1.
7. `gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_1`: Go to room_4.
8. `gotodoor green_door_3 room_4 room_2`: Go to green_door_3 in room_4. This satisfies the constraint of being in front of green_door_3 with red_door_1 unlocked.

This approach takes 8 steps, the goal is satisfied in step 1, and the constraint is satisfied in step 8.

Given the information I have, this seems to be one of the most efficient approaches.

But there's another approach that might be just as efficient:

1. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_2`: Go to green_door_1 in room_1.
2. `toggle green_door_1`: Unlock green_door_1.
3. `gotoroom room_1 room_2 green_door_1`: Go to room_2.
4. `gotoobject red_ball_2 room_2`: Go to red_ball_2. This satisfies the goal of being in front of a red ball.
5. `gotodoor green_door_3 room_2 room_4`: Go to green_door_3 in room_2.
6. `toggle green_door_3`: Unlock green_door_3.
7. `gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_3`: Go to room_4.
8. `gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_3`: Go to red_door_1 in room_4.
9. `toggle red_door_1`: Unlock red_door_1.
10. `gotodoor green_door_3 room_4 room_2`: Go back to green_door_3 in room_4. This satisfies the constraint of being in front of green_door_3 with red_door_1 unlocked.

Wait, there's a subtlety here that I missed. In the action descriptions, it says:
"goto door": go to door d only if (i) you are in a room which door d is connecting with another room, and (ii) there is no object blocking the position in front of d in the room

OK I'm going to be careful here. 

Alright, let's reconsider our approaches, being mindful of the action descriptions.

Let's revisit the plan I had in mind:

Approach 1:
1. `gotoobject red_ball_1 room_1`: This satisfies the goal of being in front of a red ball.
2. `gotodoor green_door_2 room_1 room_3`: Go to green_door_2 in room_1. (I'm in the correct room for this action).
3. `toggle green_door_2`: Unlock green_door_2.
4. `gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_2`: Go to room_3. (The door is now unlocked, so this is valid.)
5. `gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_4`: Go to red_door_1 in room_3. (I'm in the correct room for this action).
6. `toggle red_door_1`: Unlock red_door_1.
7. `gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_1`: Go to room_4. (The door is now unlocked, so this is valid.)
8. `gotodoor green_door_3 room_4 room_2`: Go to green_door_3 in room_4. (I'm in the correct room for this action). This satisfies the constraint of being in front of green_door_3 with red_door_1 unlocked.

This approach seems valid. Let me check if there are any issues with the other approach:

Approach 2:
1. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_2`: Go to green_door_1 in room_1. (I'm in the correct room for this action).
2. `toggle green_door_1`: Unlock green_door_1.
3. `gotoroom room_1 room_2 green_door_1`: Go to room_2. (The door is now unlocked, so this is valid.)
4. `gotoobject red_ball_2 room_2`: Go to red_ball_2. This satisfies the goal of being in front of a red ball.
5. `gotodoor green_door_3 room_2 room_4`: Go to green_door_3 in room_2. (I'm in the correct room for this action).
6. `toggle green_door_3`: Unlock green_door_3.
7. `gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_3`: Go to room_4. (The door is now unlocked, so this is valid.)
8. `gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_3`: Go to red_door_1 in room_4. (I'm in the correct room for this action).
9. `toggle red_door_1`: Unlock red_door_1.
10. `gotodoor green_door_3 room_4 room_2`: Go back to green_door_3 in room_4. (I'm in the correct room for this action). This satisfies the constraint of being in front of green_door_3 with red_door_1 unlocked.

I think both approaches are valid, but Approach 1 is more efficient with 8 steps, while Approach 2 takes 10 steps.

Let me check once more for any optimizations or issues.

Actually, I think I can further optimize Approach 1. Instead of going to red_ball_1 first, I can directly go to green_door_2, which saves me one step.

Optimized Approach 1:
1. `gotodoor green_door_2 room_1 room_3`: Go to green_door_2 in room_1. (I'm in the correct room for this action).
2. `toggle green_door_2`: Unlock green_door_2.
3. `gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_2`: Go to room_3. (The door is now unlocked, so this is valid.)
4. `gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_4`: Go to red_door_1 in room_3. (I'm in the correct room for this action).
5. `toggle red_door_1`: Unlock red_door_1.
6. `gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_1`: Go to room_4. (The door is now unlocked, so this is valid.)
7. `gotodoor green_door_3 room_4 room_2`: Go to green_door_3 in room_4. (I'm in the correct room for this action). This satisfies the constraint of being in front of green_door_3 with red_door_1 unlocked.
8. `toggle green_door_3`: Unlock green_door_3.
9. `gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_3`: Go to room_2. (The door is now unlocked, so this is valid.)
10. `gotoobject red_ball_2 room_2`: Go to red_ball_2. This satisfies the goal of being in front of a red ball.

This is just a re-ordering, and it's still 10 steps, so the original Approach 1 is still more efficient.

Actually, Approach 1 still has red_ball_1 as the first goal to satisfy. I think what makes Approach 1 more efficient is that it completes the goal at the first step. Both the goal and constraint are independent and need to be satisfied. Approach 1 satisfies the goal early, which is more efficient for this problem.

Let's finalize with the most efficient approach, which is Approach 1:

1. `gotoobject red_ball_1 room_1`: This satisfies the goal of being in front of a red ball.
2. `gotodoor green_door_2 room_1 room_3`: Go to green_door_2 in room_1.
3. `toggle green_door_2`: Unlock green_door_2.
4. `gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_2`: Go to room_3.
5. `gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_4`: Go to red_door_1 in room_3.
6. `toggle red_door_1`: Unlock red_door_1.
7. `gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_1`: Go to room_4.
8. `gotodoor green_door_3 room_4 room_2`: Go to green_door_3 in room_4. This satisfies the constraint of being in front of green_door_3 with red_door_1 unlocked.

I don't see any more optimizations, so this seems to be one of the most efficient approaches to satisfy both the goal and the constraint.

Actually, the statement of the problem says I need to provide an optimal plan. I'm confident that Approach 1 is optimal. Let's reiterate:

```
gotoobject red_ball_1 room_1
gotodoor green_door_2 room_1 room_3
toggle green_door_2
gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_2
gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_4
toggle red_door_1
gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_1
gotodoor green_door_3 room_4 room_2
```

This approach takes 8 steps, in which the goal is satisfied in step 1, and the constraint is satisfied in step 8. I don't believe it's possible to satisfy both the goal and the constraint in fewer than 8 steps, given the layout of the rooms and the initial state.

I also don't think there's an alternative 8-step approach that's as efficient. If I were to satisfy the constraint first, then I'd need to go to red_ball_1 or red_ball_2 afterwards. This would require at least as many steps, if not more.

So, I'm confident that the 8-step approach listed above is one of the most efficient ways to satisfy both the goal and the constraint.
