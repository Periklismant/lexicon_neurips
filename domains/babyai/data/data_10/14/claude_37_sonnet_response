Let me understand the planning problem:

We're in a 2D gridworld with 4 rooms:
- Room 1 (north-west)
- Room 2 (south-west)
- Room 3 (north-east)
- Room 4 (south-east)

Connected by 4 doors:
- Grey Door 1: Room 1 - Room 2
- Blue Door 1: Room 1 - Room 3
- Yellow Door 1: Room 2 - Room 4
- Yellow Door 2: Room 3 - Room 4

The initial state:
- We are in Room 1
- Green Ball 1, Green Ball 2, Grey Ball 1, Green Ball 3 are in Room 1
- Purple Box 1 is in Room 2
- Red Ball 1, Red Ball 2 are in Room 3
- Grey Ball 2 is in Room 4
- All doors are locked
- We've visited Room 1

Goal:
- Be in front of an unlocked Yellow Door that connects Room 2 and Room 4 (which is Yellow Door 1)

Constraints:
1. Must be in front of Green Ball 2 at some point
2. Must be holding an object while Blue Door 1 is unlocked at some point
3. Yellow Door 1 must be unlocked at some point
4. Before Yellow Door 1 is unlocked, must be holding Grey Ball 2
5. Must be in Room 1 at some point
6. If in Room 1, then either holding Red Ball 1 or Green Ball 2 is in Room 2
7. Never be in Room 2
8. Grey Door 1 must remain locked
9. Yellow Door 1 must be locked at some point
10. After Yellow Door 1 is locked, Blue Door 1 must be unlocked
11. Must be holding Grey Ball 1 at some point
12. Must be holding some object at some point
13. Must be in front of Grey Door 1 at some point
14. Before being in front of Grey Door 1, either you or Purple Box 1 must be in Room 4

This is tricky because:
- We can't go to Room 2 (constraint 7)
- But we need to be in front of Yellow Door 1 (the goal) which connects Room 2 and Room 4
- This means we need to be in front of Yellow Door 1 from Room 4

Let's think through a possible plan:

1. We start in Room 1
2. Go in front of Green Ball 2 (satisfies constraint 1)
3. Pick up Grey Ball 1 (helps satisfy constraint 11 and 12)
4. Go to Blue Door 1
5. Toggle Blue Door 1 to unlock it (holding Grey Ball 1)
6. Go to Room 3
7. Drop Grey Ball 1 (already satisfied constraint 11 and part of 12)
8. Pick up Red Ball 1 (to satisfy constraint 6)
9. Go to Yellow Door 2
10. Toggle Yellow Door 2 to unlock it
11. Go to Room 4
12. Drop Red Ball 1 (constraint 6 is now satisfied)
13. Pick up Grey Ball 2 (for constraint 4)
14. Go to Yellow Door 1 (from Room 4 side)
15. Toggle Yellow Door 1 to unlock it (satisfies constraint 3, and with Grey Ball 2 in hand satisfies constraint 4)
16. Toggle Yellow Door 1 to lock it again (satisfies constraint 9)
17. Go to Yellow Door 2
18. Toggle Yellow Door 2 to lock it
19. Go to Room 3
20. Go to Blue Door 1
21. Toggle Blue Door 1 to make sure it's unlocked (satisfies constraint 10)
22. Pick up an object (e.g., Red Ball 2)
23. Go to Room 1 (satisfies constraint 5, and with Red Ball 1 in hand satisfies constraint 6)
24. Go to Grey Door 1 (satisfies constraint 13, but we need Purple Box 1 or ourselves to be in Room 4 first)

Hmm, we have a problem with constraint 14. We need to have been in Room 4 or have Purple Box 1 in Room 4 before going in front of Grey Door 1. Purple Box 1 starts in Room 2 and we can't go to Room 2, so we need to be in Room 4 before going in front of Grey Door 1.

Let's revise the plan:

1. We start in Room 1
2. Go in front of Green Ball 2 (satisfies constraint 1)
3. Pick up Grey Ball 1 (helps satisfy constraint 11 and 12)
4. Go to Blue Door 1
5. Toggle Blue Door 1 to unlock it (holding Grey Ball 1 satisfies constraint 2)
6. Go to Room 3
7. Drop Grey Ball 1 (already satisfied constraint 11 and part of 12)
8. Pick up Red Ball 1 (to satisfy constraint 6)
9. Go to Yellow Door 2
10. Toggle Yellow Door 2 to unlock it
11. Go to Room 4 (this will help satisfy constraint 14)
12. Drop Red Ball 1 (constraint 6 is now satisfied)
13. Pick up Grey Ball 2 (for constraint 4)
14. Go to Yellow Door 1 (from Room 4 side)
15. Toggle Yellow Door 1 to unlock it (satisfies constraint 3, and with Grey Ball 2 in hand satisfies constraint 4)
16. Toggle Yellow Door 1 to lock it again (satisfies constraint 9)
17. Go to Yellow Door 2
18. Go to Room 3
19. Go to Blue Door 1
20. Toggle Blue Door 1 to make sure it's unlocked (satisfies constraint 10)
21. Pick up an object (e.g., Red Ball 2) to satisfy part of constraint 2
22. Go to Room 1 (satisfies constraint 5, and with Red Ball 1 in hand satisfies constraint 6)
23. Go to Grey Door 1 (satisfies constraint 13, and we've been in Room 4 to satisfy constraint 14)

Now we need to come back to Room 4 and unlock Yellow Door 1, which will be the goal:

24. Go to Blue Door 1
25. Go to Room 3
26. Drop Red Ball 2
27. Go to Yellow Door 2
28. Toggle Yellow Door 2 to unlock it (if it's locked)
29. Go to Room 4
30. Go to Yellow Door 1
31. Toggle Yellow Door 1 to unlock it (goal achieved)

But I see a problem. Constraint 7 says we can never be in Room 2, but the goal requires us to be in front of Yellow Door 1 which connects Room 2 and Room 4. Since we can't go to Room 2, we must be in front of it from Room 4's side.

Now there's a contradiction with the goal. The goal says:
"There is a door d such that 'The following conditions are all true: "d is yellow", "room_2 and room_4 are connected via d", "you are in front of d", "d is not locked"'"

This means we need to be in front of Yellow Door 1 (from either Room 2 or Room 4) and it needs to be unlocked. But constraint 7 says we can never be in Room 2, so we have to be in front of Yellow Door 1 from Room 4.

Let me revise the plan again with this in mind:

1. We start in Room 1
2. Go in front of Green Ball 2 (satisfies constraint 1)
3. Pick up Grey Ball 1 (helps satisfy constraint 11 and 12)
4. Go to Blue Door 1
5. Toggle Blue Door 1 to unlock it (holding Grey Ball 1 satisfies constraint 2)
6. Go to Room 3
7. Drop Grey Ball 1 (already satisfied constraint 11 and part of 12)
8. Pick up Red Ball 1 (to satisfy constraint 6)
9. Go to Yellow Door 2
10. Toggle Yellow Door 2 to unlock it
11. Go to Room 4 (this will help satisfy constraint 14)
12. Drop Red Ball 1
13. Pick up Grey Ball 2 (for constraint 4)
14. Go to Yellow Door 1 (from Room 4 side)
15. Toggle Yellow Door 1 to unlock it (satisfies constraint 3, and with Grey Ball 2 in hand satisfies constraint 4)
16. Drop Grey Ball 2
17. Go to Yellow Door 1 (goal achieved: in front of Yellow Door 1, which is unlocked)

But I just realized we're missing constraint 9: "Yellow Door 1 must be locked at some point". Yellow Door 1 starts locked, but I'm not sure if that counts as satisfying the constraint. Let's assume we need to explicitly have it locked after it's been unlocked.

And also constraint 10: "If Yellow Door 1 is locked, then Blue Door 1 must be unlocked". We've already unlocked Blue Door 1, so this will be satisfied.

There's one more issue: constraint 6 requires that if we're in Room 1, then either we're holding Red Ball 1 or Green Ball 2 is in Room 2. Since we can never be in Room 2 (constraint 7), we can't move Green Ball 2 there. So when we're in Room 1, we must be holding Red Ball 1.

Let's revise the plan:

1. We start in Room 1 - need to hold Red Ball 1 or have Green Ball 2 in Room 2, but we can't ever be in Room 2
2. Go in front of Green Ball 2 (satisfies constraint 1)
3. Pick up Grey Ball 1 (helps satisfy constraint 11 and 12)
4. Go to Blue Door 1
5. Toggle Blue Door 1 to unlock it (holding Grey Ball 1 satisfies constraint 2)
6. Go to Room 3
7. Drop Grey Ball 1 (already satisfied constraint 11 and part of 12)
8. Pick up Red Ball 1 (to satisfy constraint 6)
9. Go to Yellow Door 2
10. Toggle Yellow Door 2 to unlock it
11. Go to Room 4 (this will help satisfy constraint 14)
12. Go in front of Grey Door 1 (from Room 4 side, satisfies constraint 13)
13. Go to Yellow Door 1 (from Room 4 side)
14. Drop Red Ball 1 (still in Room 4)
15. Pick up Grey Ball 2 (for constraint 4)
16. Toggle Yellow Door 1 to unlock it (satisfies constraint 3, and with Grey Ball 2 in hand satisfies constraint 4)
17. Toggle Yellow Door 1 to lock it again (satisfies constraint 9)
18. Go to Yellow Door 2
19. Go to Room 3
20. Go to Blue Door 1
21. Toggle Blue Door 1 (to make sure it's unlocked, satisfies constraint 10)
22. Go to Room 1 with Red Ball 1 (satisfies constraint 5 and 6)
23. Go to Blue Door 1
24. Go to Room 3
25. Drop Grey Ball 2
26. Go to Yellow Door 2
27. Go to Room 4
28. Pick up Red Ball 1
29. Go to Yellow Door 1
30. Toggle Yellow Door 1 to unlock it
31. Drop Red Ball 1
32. Goal achieved: in front of Yellow Door 1, which is unlocked

Oops, I think I made a mistake. In step 22, I said "Go to Room 1 with Red Ball 1", but we dropped Red Ball 1 in step 14. Let me fix the plan:

1. We start in Room 1 - need to hold Red Ball 1 or have Green Ball 2 in Room 2, but we can't ever be in Room 2
2. Go in front of Green Ball 2 (satisfies constraint 1)
3. Pick up Grey Ball 1 (helps satisfy constraint 11 and 12)
4. Go to Blue Door 1
5. Toggle Blue Door 1 to unlock it (holding Grey Ball 1 satisfies constraint 2)
6. Go to Room 3
7. Drop Grey Ball 1 (already satisfied constraint 11 and part of 12)
8. Pick up Red Ball 1 (to satisfy constraint 6)
9. Go to Blue Door 1
10. Go to Room 1 (satisfies constraint 5 and 6, since we're holding Red Ball 1)
11. Go to Blue Door 1
12. Go to Room 3
13. Go to Yellow Door 2
14. Toggle Yellow Door 2 to unlock it
15. Go to Room 4 (this will help satisfy constraint 14)
16. Go in front of Grey Door 1 (from Room 4 side, satisfies constraint 13)
17. Go to Yellow Door 1 (from Room 4 side)
18. Drop Red Ball 1 (still in Room 4)
19. Pick up Grey Ball 2 (for constraint 4)
20. Toggle Yellow Door 1 to unlock it (satisfies constraint 3, and with Grey Ball 2 in hand satisfies constraint 4)
21. Toggle Yellow Door 1 to lock it again (satisfies constraint 9)
22. Go to Yellow Door 2
23. Go to Room 3
24. Go to Blue Door 1
25. Toggle Blue Door 1 (to make sure it's unlocked, satisfies constraint 10)
26. Go to Yellow Door 2
27. Go to Room 4
28. Go to Yellow Door 1
29. Toggle Yellow Door 1 to unlock it
30. Drop Grey Ball 2
31. Goal achieved: in front of Yellow Door 1, which is unlocked

Let me check all the constraints one more time:

1. ✅ Be in front of Green Ball 2 at some point (step 2)
2. ✅ Be holding an object while Blue Door 1 is unlocked (steps 5-11)
3. ✅ Yellow Door 1 must be unlocked at some point (step 20, 29)
4. ✅ Before Yellow Door 1 is unlocked, be holding Grey Ball 2 (steps 19-20)
5. ✅ Be in Room 1 at some point (step 10)
6. ✅ If in Room 1, then either holding Red Ball 1 or Green Ball 2 is in Room 2 (step 10, holding Red Ball 1)
7. ✅ Never be in Room 2 (we never go to Room 2)
8. ✅ Grey Door 1 must remain locked (we never toggle Grey Door 1)
9. ✅ Yellow Door 1 must be locked at some point (step 21)
10. ✅ After Yellow Door 1 is locked, Blue Door 1 must be unlocked (steps 21, 25)
11. ✅ Be holding Grey Ball 1 at some point (steps 3-6)
12. ✅ Be holding some object at some point (steps 3-6, 8-11, 19-20, etc.)
13. ✅ Be in front of Grey Door 1 at some point (step 16)
14. ✅ Before being in front of Grey Door 1, either you or Purple Box 1 must be in Room 4 (step 15, we're in Room 4)

And the goal:
✅ Be in front of Yellow Door 1 while it's unlocked (steps 29-31)

I think this plan works!

One more thing: let me just double-check the optimal plan by eliminating any unnecessary steps:

1. We start in Room 1
2. gotoobject green_ball_2 room_1
3. pick green_ball_2 room_1
4. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_3
5. toggle blue_door_1
6. gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_1
7. drop green_ball_2 room_3
8. pick red_ball_1 room_3
9. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_3 room_4
10. toggle yellow_door_2
11. gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_2
12. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_2
13. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_2
14. drop red_ball_1 room_4
15. pick grey_ball_2 room_4
16. toggle yellow_door_1
17. toggle yellow_door_1
18. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_3
19. gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_2
20. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_1
21. toggle blue_door_1
22. gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_1
23. pick grey_ball_1 room_1
24. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_3
25. gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_1
26. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_3 room_4
27. gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_2
28. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_2
29. toggle yellow_door_1
30. drop grey_ball_1 room_4

Wait, I realize I've been making a mistake. I need to specifically go in front of Green Ball 2 (constraint 1), not pick it up. Let me correct:

1. We start in Room 1
2. gotoobject green_ball_2 room_1 (satisfies constraint 1)
3. pick grey_ball_1 room_1 (satisfies constraint 11 and part of 12)
4. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_3
5. toggle blue_door_1 (satisfies constraint 2 since we're holding Grey Ball 1)
6. gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_1
7. drop grey_ball_1 room_3
8. pick red_ball_1 room_3
9. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_1
10. gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_1 (satisfies constraint 5 and 6, since we're holding Red Ball 1)
11. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_3
12. gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_1
13. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_3 room_4
14. toggle yellow_door_2
15. gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_2 (helps satisfy constraint 14)
16. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_2 (satisfies constraint 13)
17. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_2
18. drop red_ball_1 room_4
19. pick grey_ball_2 room_4
20. toggle yellow_door_1 (satisfies constraint 3, and with Grey Ball 2 in hand satisfies constraint 4)
21. toggle yellow_door_1 (satisfies constraint 9)
22. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_3
23. gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_2
24. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_1
25. toggle blue_door_1 (ensures it's unlocked, satisfies constraint 10)
26. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_3 room_4
27. gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_2
28. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_2
29. toggle yellow_door_1 (unlocks it again)
30. drop grey_ball_2 room_4
31. Goal achieved: in front of Yellow Door 1, which is unlocked

I realize step 25 is unnecessary since Blue Door 1 is already unlocked. Let me remove it:

1. We start in Room 1
2. gotoobject green_ball_2 room_1 (satisfies constraint 1)
3. pick grey_ball_1 room_1 (satisfies constraint 11 and part of 12)
4. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_3
5. toggle blue_door_1 (satisfies constraint 2 since we're holding Grey Ball 1)
6. gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_1
7. drop grey_ball_1 room_3
8. pick red_ball_1 room_3
9. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_1
10. gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_1 (satisfies constraint 5 and 6, since we're holding Red Ball 1)
11. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_3
12. gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_1
13. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_3 room_4
14. toggle yellow_door_2
15. gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_2 (helps satisfy constraint 14)
16. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_2 (satisfies constraint 13)
17. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_2
18. drop red_ball_1 room_4
19. pick grey_ball_2 room_4
20. toggle yellow_door_1 (satisfies constraint 3, and with Grey Ball 2 in hand satisfies constraint 4)
21. toggle yellow_door_1 (satisfies constraint 9)
22. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_3
23. gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_2
24. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_3 room_4
25. gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_2
26. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_2
27. toggle yellow_door_1 (unlocks it again)
28. drop grey_ball_2 room_4
29. Goal achieved: in front of Yellow Door 1, which is unlocked

Wait, I made a mistake in removing step 25. We need to explicitly make sure Blue Door 1 is unlocked after Yellow Door 1 is locked (constraint 10). But Blue Door 1 is already unlocked since we never locked it. Let me review the entire plan once more to make sure it's optimal:

1. We start in Room 1
2. gotoobject green_ball_2 room_1 (satisfies constraint 1)
3. pick grey_ball_1 room_1 (satisfies constraint 11 and part of 12)
4. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_3
5. toggle blue_door_1 (satisfies constraint 2 since we're holding Grey Ball 1)
6. gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_1
7. drop grey_ball_1 room_3
8. pick red_ball_1 room_3
9. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_1
10. gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_1 (satisfies constraint 5 and 6, since we're holding Red Ball 1)
11. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_3
12. gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_1
13. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_3 room_4
14. toggle yellow_door_2
15. gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_2 (helps satisfy constraint 14)
16. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_2 (satisfies constraint 13)
17. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_2
18. drop red_ball_1 room_4
19. pick grey_ball_2 room_4
20. toggle yellow_door_1 (satisfies constraint 3, and with Grey Ball 2 in hand satisfies constraint 4)
21. toggle yellow_door_1 (satisfies constraint 9)
22. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_3
23. gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_2
24. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_3 room_4
25. gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_2
26. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_2
27. toggle yellow_door_1 (unlocks it again)
28. Goal achieved: in front of Yellow Door 1, which is unlocked

Actually, I think we can make the plan even more efficient by eliminating the loop through Room 1 (steps 9-12) since it doesn't seem necessary:

1. gotoobject green_ball_2 room_1 (satisfies constraint 1)
2. pick grey_ball_1 room_1 (satisfies constraint 11 and part of 12)
3. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_3
4. toggle blue_door_1 (satisfies constraint 2 since we're holding Grey Ball 1)
5. gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_1
6. drop grey_ball_1 room_3
7. pick red_ball_1 room_3
8. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_1
9. gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_1 (satisfies constraint 5 and 6, since we're holding Red Ball 1)
10. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_3
11. gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_1
12. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_3 room_4
13. toggle yellow_door_2
14. gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_2 (helps satisfy constraint 14)
15. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_2 (satisfies constraint 13)
16. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_2
17. drop red_ball_1 room_4
18. pick grey_ball_2 room_4
19. toggle yellow_door_1 (satisfies constraint 3, and with Grey Ball 2 in hand satisfies constraint 4)
20. toggle yellow_door_1 (satisfies constraint 9)
21. drop grey_ball_2 room_4
22. pick red_ball_1 room_4
23. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_2
24. toggle yellow_door_1 (unlocks it again)
25. Goal achieved: in front of Yellow Door 1, which is unlocked

Oops, I introduced an unnecessary step. Let me fix it:

1. gotoobject green_ball_2 room_1 (satisfies constraint 1)
2. pick grey_ball_1 room_1 (satisfies constraint 11 and part of 12)
3. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_3
4. toggle blue_door_1 (satisfies constraint 2 since we're holding Grey Ball 1)
5. gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_1
6. drop grey_ball_1 room_3
7. pick red_ball_1 room_3
8. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_1
9. gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_1 (satisfies constraint 5 and 6, since we're holding Red Ball 1)
10. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_3
11. gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_1
12. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_3 room_4
13. toggle yellow_door_2
14. gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_2 (helps satisfy constraint 14)
15. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_2 (satisfies constraint 13)
16. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_2
17. drop red_ball_1 room_4
18. pick grey_ball_2 room_4
19. toggle yellow_door_1 (satisfies constraint 3, and with Grey Ball 2 in hand satisfies constraint 4)
20. toggle yellow_door_1 (satisfies constraint 9)
21. drop grey_ball_2 room_4
22. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_2
23. toggle yellow_door_1 (unlocks it again)
24. Goal achieved: in front of Yellow Door 1, which is unlocked

Hmm, I think I'm not understanding the constraint 6 correctly. Let me restate it:

"If expression 'you are in room_1' holds in some state s, then expression 'At least one of the following conditions is true: "you are holding red_ball_1", "green_ball_2 is in room_2"' must hold at s or at some state after s"

This means that at least once after being in Room 1, either we must be holding Red Ball 1, or Green Ball 2 must be in Room 2. Since we can't enter Room 2, we can't move Green Ball 2 there. So we need to pick up Red Ball 1 at some point after being in Room 1.

But this is a bit of a problem. We start in Room 1, so we need to pick up Red Ball 1 at some point after that. But if we go back to Room 1 (like in step 9 above), then we need to pick up Red Ball 1 again after that. Let me be careful about this constraint.

Since we start in Room 1, we need to make sure that at some point after the initial state, we're holding Red Ball 1. This is satisfied in steps 7-17 above.

But if we go back to Room 1 again (step 9), then we need to make sure that afterwards, we either hold Red Ball 1 or Green Ball 2 is in Room 2. Since we continue to hold Red Ball 1 until step 17, this constraint is satisfied.

So I think the plan is correct, but let me check all the constraints once more:

1. ✅ Be in front of Green Ball 2 at some point (step 1)
2. ✅ Be holding an object while Blue Door 1 is unlocked (steps 4-11)
3. ✅ Yellow Door 1 must be unlocked at some point (step 19, 23)
4. ✅ Before Yellow Door 1 is unlocked, be holding Grey Ball 2 (steps 18-19)
5. ✅ Be in Room 1 at some point (we start there, and again in step 9)
6. ✅ If in Room 1, then either holding Red Ball 1 or Green Ball 2 is in Room 2 (we hold Red Ball 1 in steps 7-17, which is after both instances of being in Room 1)
7. ✅ Never be in Room 2 (we never go to Room 2)
8. ✅ Grey Door 1 must remain locked (we never toggle Grey Door 1)
9. ✅ Yellow Door 1 must be locked at some point (step 20)
10. ✅ After Yellow Door 1 is locked, Blue Door 1 must be unlocked (Blue Door 1 is unlocked in step 4 and remains unlocked)
11. ✅ Be holding Grey Ball 1 at some point (steps 2-5)
12. ✅ Be holding some object at some point (steps 2-9, 18-20, etc.)
13. ✅ Be in front of Grey Door 1 at some point (step 15)
14. ✅ Before being in front of Grey Door 1, either you or Purple Box 1 must be in Room 4 (step 14, we're in Room 4)

And the goal:
✅ Be in front of Yellow Door 1 while it's unlocked (steps 23-24)

I think this plan is correct!

Let me make sure the final plan is formatted according to the requirements:

```
gotoobject green_ball_2 room_1
pick grey_ball_1 room_1
gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_3
toggle blue_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_1
drop grey_ball_1 room_3
pick red_ball_1 room_3
gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_1
gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_1
gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_3
gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_1
gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_3 room_4
toggle yellow_door_2
gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_2
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_2
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_2
drop red_ball_1 room_4
pick grey_ball_2 room_4
toggle yellow_door_1
toggle yellow_door_1
drop grey_ball_2 room_4
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_2
toggle yellow_door_1
```

Actually I realize I might be making things too complicated. Since constraint 6 says "If in Room 1, then afterwards either holding Red Ball 1 or Green Ball 2 is in Room 2", and we start in Room 1, and later we hold Red Ball 1, the constraint is automatically satisfied without having to go back to Room 1. Let me re-optimize the plan:

1. gotoobject green_ball_2 room_1 (satisfies constraint 1)
2. pick grey_ball_1 room_1 (satisfies constraint 11 and part of 12)
3. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_3
4. toggle blue_door_1 (satisfies constraint 2 since we're holding Grey Ball 1)
5. gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_1
6. drop grey_ball_1 room_3
7. pick red_ball_1 room_3 (to satisfy constraint 6, since we were in Room 1 at the start)
8. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_3 room_4
9. toggle yellow_door_2
10. gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_2 (helps satisfy constraint 14)
11. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_2 (satisfies constraint 13)
12. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_2
13. drop red_ball_1 room_4
14. pick grey_ball_2 room_4
15. toggle yellow_door_1 (satisfies constraint 3, and with Grey Ball 2 in hand satisfies constraint 4)
16. toggle yellow_door_1 (satisfies constraint 9)
17. drop grey_ball_2 room_4
18. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_2
19. toggle yellow_door_1 (unlocks it again)
20. Goal achieved: in front of Yellow Door 1, which is unlocked

This plan is more efficient and still satisfies all the constraints.

Let me revise it one more time to see if I can make it even more efficient:

1. gotoobject green_ball_2 room_1 (satisfies constraint 1)
2. pick grey_ball_1 room_1 (satisfies constraint 11 and part of 12)
3. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_3
4. toggle blue_door_1 (satisfies constraint 2 since we're holding Grey Ball 1)
5. gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_1
6. drop grey_ball_1 room_3
7. pick red_ball_1 room_3 (to satisfy constraint 6, since we were in Room 1 at the start)
8. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_3 room_4
9. toggle yellow_door_2
10. gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_2 (helps satisfy constraint 14)
11. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_2 (satisfies constraint 13)
12. drop red_ball_1 room_4
13. pick grey_ball_2 room_4
14. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_2
15. toggle yellow_door_1 (satisfies constraint 3, and with Grey Ball 2 in hand satisfies constraint 4)
16. toggle yellow_door_1 (satisfies constraint 9)
17. drop grey_ball_2 room_4
18. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_2
19. toggle yellow_door_1 (unlocks it again)
20. Goal achieved: in front of Yellow Door 1, which is unlocked

This looks quite optimal to me. Let me see if we can remove any more steps:

- Can't remove steps 1-7 because they satisfy important constraints.
- Steps 8-10 are necessary to get to Room 4.
- Step 11 is needed to satisfy constraint 13.
- Step 12-13 are needed to get Grey Ball 2.
- Step 14 is needed to get to Yellow Door 1.
- Steps 15-16 satisfy constraints 3, 4, and 9.
- Step 17 is needed because we need empty hands to operate the door.
- Steps 18-19 are needed to achieve the goal.

I don't think we can remove any more steps. The final optimal plan is:

```
gotoobject green_ball_2 room_1
pick grey_ball_1 room_1
gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_3
toggle blue_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_1
drop grey_ball_1 room_3
pick red_ball_1 room_3
gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_3 room_4
toggle yellow_door_2
gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_2
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_2
drop red_ball_1 room_4
pick grey_ball_2 room_4
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_2
toggle yellow_door_1
toggle yellow_door_1
drop grey_ball_2 room_4
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_2
toggle yellow_door_1
```

Wait, I just realized a possible issue with constraint 10. It says "If Yellow Door 1 is locked, then Blue Door 1 must be unlocked". Yellow Door 1 starts locked, so Blue Door 1 needs to be unlocked initially too. But Blue Door 1 also starts locked according to the initial state. We unlock Blue Door 1 in step 4, which is before we interact with Yellow Door 1, so this should be fine.

There's also the period after we lock Yellow Door 1 again in step 16. Blue Door 1 is already unlocked, so this constraint is still satisfied.

I believe the plan is optimal and satisfies all constraints.

Actually, after rereading constraint 10, I think I might have misinterpreted it before. It says:

"If expression 'yellow_door_1 is locked' holds in some state s, then expression 'blue_door_1 is not locked' must hold at s or at some state after s"

This means that whenever Yellow Door 1 is locked, either at that moment or sometime after, Blue Door 1 must be unlocked. Since Yellow Door 1 starts locked, we need to make sure Blue Door 1 is unlocked at some point, which we do in step 4. And after we lock Yellow Door 1 again in step 16, Blue Door 1 is already unlocked, so this constraint is satisfied.

I think the plan is correct and optimal.
