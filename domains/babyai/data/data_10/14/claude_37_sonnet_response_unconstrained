Alright, so I have a planning problem in a gridworld. Let me break it down:

1. **Environment**: 
   - 4 rooms (room_1 to room_4) arranged in a square.
   - 4 doors connecting rooms: room_1-room_2, room_1-room_3, room_2-room_4, room_3-room_4.
   - Objects: boxes and balls with colors.

2. **Initial State**:
   - I am in room_1
   - Various balls in different rooms:
     - In room_1: green_ball_1, green_ball_2, grey_ball_1, green_ball_3
     - In room_2: purple_box_1
     - In room_3: red_ball_1, red_ball_2
     - In room_4: grey_ball_2
   - All doors are locked: grey_door_1, blue_door_1, yellow_door_1, yellow_door_2
   - I am not holding any object

3. **Goal**:
   - I need to be in front of an unlocked yellow door that connects room_2 and room_4.

From the objects, I can see that yellow_door_1 connects room_2 and room_4. So, my goal is to:
1. Go to room_2
2. Go in front of yellow_door_1
3. Unlock yellow_door_1 (using the toggle action)
4. Ensure I am in front of yellow_door_1

First, let's think about how to get to room_2 from room_1. I need to go through grey_door_1, but it's locked. I need to:
1. Go in front of grey_door_1
2. Unlock grey_door_1 (toggle)
3. Go to room_2

Now, let's plan the steps:

1. `gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2`: Go in front of grey_door_1.
2. `toggle grey_door_1`: Unlock grey_door_1.
3. `gotoroom room_1 room_2 grey_door_1`: Move to room_2.
4. `gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_4`: Go in front of yellow_door_1.
5. `toggle yellow_door_1`: Unlock yellow_door_1.

Let's check this plan against the constraints and preconditions:

- `gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2`: I can go in front of grey_door_1 if I'm in room_1, and there's no object blocking the door. I'm in room_1, and there's no indication that an object is blocking the door.
- `toggle grey_door_1`: I can toggle a door if I'm in front of it, which I will be after the first action.
- `gotoroom room_1 room_2 grey_door_1`: I can go to room_2 if I'm in room_1 and the door is unlocked, which it will be after the second action.
- `gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_4`: I can go in front of yellow_door_1 if I'm in room_2 and there's no object blocking the door. I'll be in room_2 after the third action, and there's no indication that an object is blocking the door.
- `toggle yellow_door_1`: I can toggle a door if I'm in front of it, which I will be after the fourth action.

At the end of this plan, the goal conditions should be satisfied:
- I am in front of yellow_door_1
- yellow_door_1 is yellow (from the initial state)
- yellow_door_1 connects room_2 and room_4 (from the initial state)
- yellow_door_1 is unlocked (after toggling it)

So, the plan seems valid. Let's finalize it:

```
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2
toggle grey_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_2 grey_door_1
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_4
toggle yellow_door_1
```

Actually, wait. Let's make sure I'm interpreting the goal correctly. The goal is:
```
"There is a door d such that "The following conditions are all true: "d is yellow", "room_2 and room_4 are connected via d", "you are in front of d", "d is not locked"""
```

In logical terms, this means there exists a door d such that:
1. d is yellow
2. room_2 and room_4 are connected via d
3. I am in front of d
4. d is not locked

From the initial state, only yellow_door_1 satisfies conditions 1 and 2. The task is to make conditions 3 and 4 true as well. So my plan aims to get me in front of yellow_door_1 and make it unlocked. I think my plan should achieve this goal, so it's valid.

Let me check the actions again:

**gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2**:
- Preconditions: I should be in room_1 (I am from the initial state) and the door should be accessible (no objects blocking, which seems to be the case).
- Effect: I am now in front of grey_door_1.

**toggle grey_door_1**:
- Preconditions: I should be in front of grey_door_1 (I am after the first action).
- Effect: grey_door_1 is now unlocked.

**gotoroom room_1 room_2 grey_door_1**:
- Preconditions: I should be in room_1 (I am from the initial state), in front of grey_door_1 (I am after the first action), and grey_door_1 should be unlocked (it is after the second action).
- Effect: I am now in room_2.

**gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_4**:
- Preconditions: I should be in room_2 (I am after the third action) and the door should be accessible.
- Effect: I am now in front of yellow_door_1.

**toggle yellow_door_1**:
- Preconditions: I should be in front of yellow_door_1 (I am after the fourth action).
- Effect: yellow_door_1 is now unlocked.

After these actions, the goal conditions should be met: I am in front of yellow_door_1, which is a yellow door connecting room_2 and room_4, and it's unlocked. So, the plan is valid.

Let me provide the final solution:

```
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2
toggle grey_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_2 grey_door_1
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_4
toggle yellow_door_1
```

Actually, I need to double-check the syntax. The goal says:

"There is a door d such that 'The following conditions are all true: d is yellow', 'room_2 and room_4 are connected via d', 'you are in front of d', 'd is not locked'"

According to the initial state, yellow_door_1 connects room_2 and room_4, and it is yellow. We need to be in front of it and it should be unlocked.

Actually, I think I got a bit confused earlier. Let me break down the problem once again:

1. Initial State:
   - I am in room_1
   - All doors are locked
   - yellow_door_1 connects room_2 and room_4

2. Goal:
   - There exists a door d such that:
     a. d is yellow
     b. d connects room_2 and room_4
     c. I am in front of d
     d. d is unlocked

The only door that satisfies conditions (a) and (b) is yellow_door_1. Hence, our goal simplifies to:
   - I am in front of yellow_door_1
   - yellow_door_1 is unlocked

To achieve this, I need to:
1. Go to room_2
2. Go in front of yellow_door_1
3. Unlock yellow_door_1

To go to room_2 from room_1, I need to use grey_door_1, but it's locked. So, I need to:
1. Go in front of grey_door_1
2. Unlock grey_door_1
3. Go from room_1 to room_2 using grey_door_1

So, the plan seems correct. Let's ensure the syntax is right:

1. `gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2`: Go in front of grey_door_1 from room_1.
2. `toggle grey_door_1`: Unlock grey_door_1.
3. `gotoroom room_1 room_2 grey_door_1`: Go from room_1 to room_2 using grey_door_1.
4. `gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_4`: Go in front of yellow_door_1 from room_2.
5. `toggle yellow_door_1`: Unlock yellow_door_1.

Actually, I need to verify that the syntax is correct given the description:

1. "gotoobject x r": Go in front of to object x in room r.
2. "gotoempty": Go in front of an empty position of the room, which does not contain any object.
3. "gotodoor d r1 r2": Go in front of door d, connecting room r1 to room r2.
4. "gotoroom r1 r2 d": Go to room r2 from room r1 using door d.
5. "pick x r": Pick up object x in room r.
6. "drop x r": Drop object x in room r.
7. "toggle d": Unlock door d if is locked. Lock door d if is unlocked.

Let me re-check my plan syntax:

1. `gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2`: Correct, using the syntax for "gotodoor".
2. `toggle grey_door_1`: Correct, using the syntax for "toggle".
3. `gotoroom room_1 room_2 grey_door_1`: Correct, using the syntax for "gotoroom".
4. `gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_4`: Correct, using the syntax for "gotodoor".
5. `toggle yellow_door_1`: Correct, using the syntax for "toggle".

The syntax of my plan seems correct. Now, let's check if the plan achieves the goal:

After all these actions:
- I am in room_2
- I am in front of yellow_door_1
- yellow_door_1 is unlocked
- yellow_door_1 is yellow (from the initial state)
- yellow_door_1 connects room_2 and room_4 (from the initial state)

This matches the goal conditions.

Actually, I just realized something: When we do `gotodoor`, there's no guarantee that I'll be in a specific room. Let me re-check the preconditions for `gotodoor`:

"goto door": you may only go in front of a door d if (i) you are in a room which door d is connecting with another room, and (ii) there is no object blocking the position in front of d in the room you are currently in.

So, if I'm in room_1, I can only go in front of doors that connect to room_1. After I use `gotoroom room_1 room_2 grey_door_1`, I'm in room_2. From room_2, I can go in front of doors that connect to room_2, like yellow_door_1.

So, the `gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_4` action is valid, since yellow_door_1 connects room_2 and room_4, and I'm in room_2 after the previous action.

I think I was confused in my explanation, but the plan is correct.

Let me provide the final solution:

```
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2
toggle grey_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_2 grey_door_1
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_4
toggle yellow_door_1
```

Actually, one more time. The precise goal is:
"There is a door d such that 'The following conditions are all true: "d is yellow", "room_2 and room_4 are connected via d", "you are in front of d", "d is not locked"'"

This means the goal is to find a door d such that:
1. d is yellow
2. d connects room_2 and room_4
3. I am in front of d
4. d is unlocked

The only door that fits conditions 1 and 2 is yellow_door_1. So, the goal simplifies to:
- I am in front of yellow_door_1
- yellow_door_1 is unlocked

Let's trace how my plan achieves this goal:

1. `gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2`:
   - I am in room_1.
   - I go in front of grey_door_1, which connects room_1 and room_2.

2. `toggle grey_door_1`:
   - I unlock grey_door_1.

3. `gotoroom room_1 room_2 grey_door_1`:
   - I move from room_1 to room_2 using grey_door_1.

4. `gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_4`:
   - I am in room_2.
   - I go in front of yellow_door_1, which connects room_2 and room_4.

5. `toggle yellow_door_1`:
   - I unlock yellow_door_1.

After these actions:
- I am in front of yellow_door_1.
- yellow_door_1 is unlocked.
- yellow_door_1 is yellow (from the initial state).
- yellow_door_1 connects room_2 and room_4 (from the initial state).

This satisfies all the goal conditions. Therefore, my plan is valid and correct.

Let's provide the solution with the required format.

```
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2
toggle grey_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_2 grey_door_1
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_4
toggle yellow_door_1
```
