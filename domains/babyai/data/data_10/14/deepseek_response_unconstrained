```
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2
toggle grey_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_2 grey_door_1
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_4
toggle yellow_door_1
```
``` 

The plan starts by navigating to and unlocking the grey_door_1 connecting room_1 and room_2. After moving to room_2, the agent proceeds to yellow_door_1 (which connects room_2 and room_4) and unlocks it. This satisfies all goal conditions: yellow_door_1 is yellow, connects room_2-room_4, the agent is in front of it, and it's unlocked. The plan is optimal with 5 actions.
