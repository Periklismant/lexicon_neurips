Okay, let's try to figure out this planning problem. So, the goal is to have a yellow door that connects room_2 and room_4, be in front of it, and have it unlocked. The initial state has all doors locked. Let me check the doors first.

Looking at the doors: grey_door_1 connects room_1 and room_2, blue_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3, yellow_door_1 connects room_2 and room_4, and yellow_door_2 connects room_3 and room_4. Both yellow doors are yellow, but the problem mentions that the door d should connect room_2 and room_4. So the correct door here is yellow_door_1. The goal is to be in front of yellow_door_1, which is unlocked.

So the steps needed are: get to room_2, unlock yellow_door_1, and be in front of it. But all doors are initially locked. The agent starts in room_1. To get to room_2, the connecting door is grey_door_1, which is grey and locked. So the agent needs to unlock grey_door_1 first. But to unlock a door, you need to be in front of it. So first, go to grey_door_1, which is in room_1 (since it connects room_1 and room_2). Wait, the doors are between rooms, so to go to a door, the agent must be in one of the connected rooms. So to reach grey_door_1 from room_1, use 'gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2'. Then toggle (unlock) it. Then go to room_2 through grey_door_1. Once in room_2, go to yellow_door_1 (which connects room_2 and room_4). Then toggle it to unlock. Then the door is unlocked, and the agent is in front of it. That should satisfy the goal.

Wait, but the initial state says that all doors are locked. So steps:

1. From room_1, go to grey_door_1 (gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2). But wait, the preconditions for gotodoor require that there's no object blocking the position in front of the door in the current room. The initial state in room_1 has green_ball_1, green_ball_2, grey_ball_1, green_ball_3. Are any of these blocking the door? The problem description says that objects can block doors. So if any object is in front of the door, the agent can't go there. But the initial state doesn't mention any objects blocking doors. Wait, the effects of 'drop' mention that if x was blocking a door, then it's no longer blocking. So maybe objects can block doors if they are placed in front of them. But in the initial state, all objects are in their rooms, but not necessarily blocking doors. So maybe the doors are not blocked initially. So the agent can go to the door as long as they are in the right room.

So first action: gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2. Then toggle it to unlock. Then gotoroom room_1 room_2 grey_door_1. Now in room_2. Then in room_2, go to yellow_door_1 (gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_4). Then toggle it to unlock. Now the door is unlocked, and the agent is in front of it. That should meet the goal.

But the constraints: the user hasn't mentioned any constraints, but the problem says to follow the constraints provided. Wait, the problem statement says "A valid plan for the abovementioned problem must abide by the following constraints:" but then there's nothing after. Maybe the user forgot to include them? Or perhaps the constraints are in the problem setup. Wait, looking back at the original problem, the constraints are not listed here. The user might have intended to include constraints, but in the provided input, the constraints section is empty. So maybe there are no additional constraints beyond the preconditions of the actions.

So proceeding under the assumption that there are no other constraints. Then the plan would be:

1. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2
2. toggle grey_door_1 (unlocks it)
3. gotoroom room_1 room_2 grey_door_1 (now in room_2)
4. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_4
5. toggle yellow_door_1 (unlocks it)
6. Now, the agent is in front of yellow_door_1, which is unlocked. So the goal is achieved.

But wait, after step 5, the agent is in front of yellow_door_1 (from step 4), then toggling it changes its state to unlocked. So the final state would have the agent in front of yellow_door_1, which is now unlocked. So steps 1-5 would be the plan. But let me check the preconditions for each step.

Step 1: gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2. The agent is in room_1, which is connected via grey_door_1. The preconditions are met (in the correct room and no object blocking). So allowed.

Step 2: toggle grey_door_1. Since the agent is in front of it after step 1, this is allowed. Toggles it to unlocked.

Step 3: gotoroom room_1 room_2 grey_door_1. The door is now unlocked, so allowed. The agent moves to room_2.

Step 4: gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_4. Agent is in room_2, which is connected via yellow_door_1. Assuming no objects are blocking the door. The initial state in room_2 has purple_box_1. But is that box blocking the door? The initial state doesn't mention that. So assuming it's not blocking. So allowed.

Step 5: toggle yellow_door_1. Now, the door is unlocked.

After step 5, the agent is in front of yellow_door_1, which is yellow, connects room_2 and room_4, and is unlocked. That meets the goal. So the plan is 5 steps. But wait, in step 5, after toggling, the door is unlocked. But the agent is still in front of it, so the final state meets all conditions.

Yes, that seems correct. So the plan would be these steps. Let me write them out properly.
