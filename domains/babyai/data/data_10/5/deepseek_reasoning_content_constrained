Okay, let's try to tackle this planning problem. The goal is to get to a yellow door that's unlocked and be in front of it. The constraints are pretty complex, so I need to make sure each one is satisfied at some point. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the initial state: I'm in room_1. There are a few objects here: yellow_ball_1, green_box_1, and blue_ball_1. All doors are locked. The doors are grey_door_1 (connects room_1 and room_2), purple_door_1 (room_1 and room_3), yellow_door_1 (room_2 and room_4), and red_door_1 (room_3 and room_4). The goal is a yellow door, which must be yellow_door_1 since that's the only yellow door. But yellow_door_1 is in room_2 and room_4. But wait, the constraints say I can't be in room_2 at any state. So I can't go through room_2. So maybe I need to go via room_3 and room_4?

Wait, the doors: purple_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3. So from room_1, I can go to room_3 via purple_door_1 if I can unlock it. Then from room_3, red_door_1 connects to room_4. So maybe the path is room_1 -> room_3 -> room_4. Then, in room_4, there's yellow_door_1 connecting to room_2, but since I can't go to room_2, I just need to be in front of yellow_door_1 in room_4.

But first, all doors are locked. So I need to unlock them. To unlock a door, I need to toggle it, which requires being in front of it. But to get to the door, I need to go to it, which might require being in the correct room and not having an object blocking the door's position.

Let's check the initial room_1. The doors here are grey_door_1 (to room_2) and purple_door_1 (to room_3). Are there any objects blocking these doors? The initial objects in room_1 are yellow_ball_1, green_box_1, blue_ball_1. If any of these are in front of the doors, then I can't go to the door until they are moved. But how do objects block doors? The precondition for "gotodoor" is that there's no object blocking the position in front of d in the current room. So if, say, green_box_1 is blocking purple_door_1, I can't go to the door unless I move the box. But I don't know their positions relative to doors. The problem statement doesn't specify where objects are in the room, just that they are in the room. So maybe the assumption is that objects are not blocking doors unless specified? Wait, the initial state doesn't mention any objects blocking doors, so perhaps all doors are unblocked. So I can go to any door in the current room as long as I'm in that room.

So in room_1, I can go to grey_door_1 (but room_2 is forbidden) or purple_door_1. But grey_door_1 is in room_1 and room_2. So to go to grey_door_1 from room_1, I can use gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2. But since I can't enter room_2, maybe I can just be in front of grey_door_1 in room_1. But there's a constraint that requires being in front of grey_door_1 in some state, but then another constraint that says if that happens, then in that state or after, grey_door_1 must be locked and I'm in front of green_box_1. Wait, but in the initial state, grey_door_1 is locked. So if I go to grey_door_1 in room_1, then in that state, grey_door_1 is locked. Then, to satisfy the implication, I need to also be in front of green_box_1 in that state or a later one. But green_box_1 is in room_1. So maybe after going to grey_door_1, I can go to green_box_1. But how?

So possible steps:

1. gotoobject green_box_1 room_1. But to do that, I need to be in room_1, which I am. Then pick up green_box_1. Wait, no, "gotoobject" just moves me in front of it. Then perhaps:

Action sequence:

- gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2 (since I'm in room_1). That would satisfy the constraint of being in front of grey_door_1. Then, in that state, grey_door_1 is locked (since initially locked), so the condition for the implication is met. But the implication requires that either in that state or after, "grey_door_1 is locked" (which it is) and "you are in front of green_box_1". So after being in front of grey_door_1, I need to go to green_box_1. So next action: gotoobject green_box_1 room_1. Then I'm in front of green_box_1. That would satisfy the implication's consequent.

But I also need to unlock the doors to get to room_4. Let's see. The goal is to be in front of a yellow door (yellow_door_1) that's unlocked. So first, unlock yellow_door_1. But yellow_door_1 is between room_2 and room_4. But since we can't enter room_2, we need to reach it from room_4. But how to get to room_4? The other path is room_1 -> room_3 via purple_door_1, then room_3 -> room_4 via red_door_1. So I need to unlock purple_door_1 and red_door_1.

But purple_door_1 is locked. To unlock it, I need to be in front of it. So from room_1, gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_3. Then toggle it to unlock. Then gotoroom room_1 room_3 purple_door_1. Then in room_3, go to red_door_1, unlock it, then go to room_4. Then in room_4, go to yellow_door_1, unlock it (but wait, the goal is to have it unlocked, so maybe just unlock it once and leave it unlocked. But the goal is that in the final state, the door is not locked. So perhaps we need to toggle it if it's locked.

But let's outline the steps:

1. Unlock purple_door_1:
   - gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_3
   - toggle purple_door_1 (unlocks it)
   - gotoroom room_1 room_3 purple_door_1 (now in room_3)
2. In room_3, unlock red_door_1 to get to room_4:
   - gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_4
   - toggle red_door_1 (unlocks it)
   - gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_1 (now in room_4)
3. Now in room_4, need to unlock yellow_door_1:
   - gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_2
   - toggle yellow_door_1 (unlocks it)
   - Now, the goal is to be in front of a yellow door (yellow_door_1) that's unlocked. So after toggling, we are in front of it, and it's unlocked. So that would satisfy the goal.

But wait, the goal is "There is a door d such that d is yellow, you are in front of d, and d is not locked". So if after toggling yellow_door_1 in room_4, we are in front of it, that's the goal. So the final action would be gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_2, then toggle, but after toggle, the door is unlocked, and we are still in front of it. So the final state after toggle would meet the goal.

But let's check the constraints:

Constraints:

1. Must be in front of grey_door_1 in some state. So earlier steps need to include that.

But in the steps above, we didn't go to grey_door_1. So we need to fit that in. Let's see: To satisfy the first constraint, the plan must include being in front of grey_door_1. So maybe before leaving room_1, go to grey_door_1.

So step 0: gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2. Now, in front of grey_door_1. Then, according to constraint 2: if in front of grey_door_1 in state s, then in s or later, grey_door_1 is locked and in front of green_box_1. Since grey_door_1 is initially locked, in state s (after step 0), it's locked. But we need to be in front of green_box_1 in s or later. So after step 0, need to go to green_box_1. So step 1: gotoobject green_box_1 room_1. Now in front of green_box_1. That satisfies the implication.

Then proceed to unlock purple_door_1, etc.

But then, the constraint 4 says that "grey_door_1 is not locked" must hold in at least one state. But initially it's locked, so we have to unlock it at some point. But constraint 5 says that if grey_door_1 is unlocked, there must be an earlier state where you are in room_4 and red_door_1 is unlocked. Wait, this is a bit tricky. Let's parse constraint 5:

"If 'grey_door_1 is not locked' holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state where you are in room_4 and red_door_1 is not locked."

So if we ever unlock grey_door_1, then before that, we must have been in room_4 with red_door_1 unlocked. But maybe we don't need to unlock grey_door_1 at all. Because the constraint 4 says "grey_door_1 is not locked" must hold in at least one state. So we have to toggle grey_door_1 at least once. Because initially it's locked. So to satisfy constraint 4, we need to toggle it to unlocked. But then, according to constraint 5, that state where it's unlocked must be preceded by a state where we are in room_4 and red_door_1 is not locked.

Hmm, this complicates things. Let's outline:

- To satisfy constraint 4, we need to have a state where grey_door_1 is not locked. So we must toggle it at least once (from locked to unlocked).

- But when we do that, according to constraint 5, there must have been an earlier state where we were in room_4 and red_door_1 was unlocked.

So the sequence must be:

1. Reach room_4.

2. Unlock red_door_1 (if it's not already unlocked).

Wait, red_door_1 connects room_3 and room_4. To unlock it, we need to be in front of it in room_3 or room_4. Let's see:

If we go from room_1 to room_3 via purple_door_1, then in room_3, we can go to red_door_1, unlock it, then go to room_4. Then, after being in room_4, we can go back to room_1 via room_3 and purple_door_1, and then unlock grey_door_1. But that's a long path.

Wait, but the problem is that to unlock grey_door_1, which is in room_1 and room_2, we need to be in front of it. But we can't enter room_2. So we have to toggle it from room_1. But to satisfy constraint 5, before toggling grey_door_1 to unlock (thus making it not locked), we need to have been in room_4 when red_door_1 was not locked.

So steps:

- Unlock purple_door_1 (room_1 to room_3)

- Go to room_3, unlock red_door_1 (from room_3), then go to room_4.

- In room_4, unlock yellow_door_1 (but that's not needed for constraint 5). Wait, the requirement for constraint 5 is that when grey_door_1 is unlocked, there was an earlier state where you were in room_4 and red_door_1 was not locked. So after unlocking red_door_1 (in room_3), you go to room_4. At that point, red_door_1 is unlocked. So being in room_4 and red_door_1 is unlocked (since you just came through it). So that state satisfies the condition for constraint 5. Then, later, when you unlock grey_door_1, you have already been in room_4 with red_door_1 unlocked.

So after unlocking red_door_1 and entering room_4, then you can go back to room_3, then to room_1, and then unlock grey_door_1. But how to get back? Let's see:

After being in room_4, to get back to room_1:

room_4 -> room_3 via red_door_1 (which is unlocked), then room_3 -> room_1 via purple_door_1 (which we unlocked earlier). So possible.

But this seems like a lot of steps. Let's try to outline:

1. In room_1:

   a. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2 (satisfy constraint 1)
   b. gotoobject green_box_1 room_1 (satisfy constraint 2)
   c. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_3
   d. toggle purple_door_1 (unlock)
   e. gotoroom room_1 room_3 purple_door_1 (now in room_3)
2. In room_3:

   a. gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_4
   b. toggle red_door_1 (unlock)
   c. gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_1 (now in room_4)
3. In room_4:

   a. Now, we are in room_4, and red_door_1 is unlocked. This satisfies the condition needed for constraint 5 (since when we later unlock grey_door_1, we have this prior state)
   b. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_2
   c. toggle yellow_door_1 (unlock) but wait, the goal is to have a yellow door that's unlocked and in front of it. So after toggling, yellow_door_1 is unlocked. But to satisfy the goal, we need to end in front of it. So perhaps this is the final step. But we also need to meet other constraints.

But let's check other constraints:

Constraint 6: At least one state where either holding red_ball_1 or blue_ball_1 is in room_2. But room_2 is forbidden. So blue_ball_1 is initially in room_1. If we move it to room_2, but we can't enter room_2. So maybe instead, pick up red_ball_1 (which is in room_3). But when are we in room_3? After step 1e. So in room_3, perhaps pick up red_ball_1. Then that satisfies constraint 6.

Constraint 7: At least one state where holding some object and holding yellow_ball_2. yellow_ball_2 is in room_3. So need to pick it up. But when in room_3 (step 2), after arriving, can we pick up yellow_ball_2?

Constraint 8: yellow_door_1 must be unlocked in some state. Which we do in step 3c.

Constraint 9: If yellow_door_1 is not locked in some state, then there was an earlier state where you were in front of red_door_1 and blue_ball_1 is in room_4. So when we unlock yellow_door_1 (step 3c), we need to have earlier been in front of red_door_1 (step 2a) and have blue_ball_1 in room_4. But blue_ball_1 starts in room_1. So we need to bring blue_ball_1 to room_4. To do that, we need to pick it up in room_1, carry it through rooms.

So steps to move blue_ball_1 to room_4:

After step 1e (in room_3), but to get back to room_1 to pick up blue_ball_1, we need to go back through purple_door_1. But that's possible. Let's adjust the plan:

After step 1e (in room_3), perhaps return to room_1 to pick up blue_ball_1 and then bring it to room_4.

But this will complicate the steps. Let's see:

1. In room_1:

   a. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2
   b. gotoobject green_box_1 room_1
   c. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_3
   d. toggle purple_door_1
   e. gotoroom room_1 room_3 purple_door_1 (now in room_3)
2. In room_3:

   a. gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_4
   b. toggle red_door_1
   c. gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_1 (now in room_4)
3. Now, need to go back to room_1 to get blue_ball_1. So from room_4:

   a. gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_3
   b. toggle red_door_1 (if needed, but already unlocked)
   c. gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_1 (back to room_3)
   d. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_1
   e. toggle purple_door_1 (already unlocked)
   f. gotoroom room_3 room_1 purple_door_1 (back to room_1)
4. In room_1:

   a. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_1
   b. pick blue_ball_1 room_1 (now holding it)
   c. Now, need to take it to room_4. So go through purple_door_1 again:

   d. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_3
   e. toggle purple_door_1 (unlocked, so no need)
   f. gotoroom room_1 room_3 purple_door_1 (to room_3)
   g. gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_4
   h. toggle red_door_1 (already unlocked)
   i. gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_1 (now in room_4 with blue_ball_1)
   j. drop blue_ball_1 room_4 (to leave it there)
5. Now, blue_ball_1 is in room_4. So in step 3i, when we are in front of red_door_1 (step 3g), blue_ball_1 is in room_4 (after dropping). Wait, but we need the condition when yellow_door_1 is unlocked (step 3c) to have a prior state where in front of red_door_1 and blue_ball_1 is in room_4. But if we unlock yellow_door_1 before moving blue_ball_1, then this condition isn't met. So the order is important. We need to first bring blue_ball_1 to room_4, then unlock yellow_door_1.

So adjust steps:

After step 4i (in room_4 with blue_ball_1), drop it. Then, go to yellow_door_1 in room_4 and unlock it.

But this is getting complicated. Let's outline the steps again, considering all constraints:

Constraints to satisfy:

1. At least once in front of grey_door_1. (Step 1a)
2. If in front of grey_door_1, then in that state or later, grey_door_1 is locked and in front of green_box_1. (Step 1a and 1b)
3. Never in room_2. (Avoid room_2)
4. At least once grey_door_1 is not locked. (Need to toggle it)
5. If grey_door_1 is unlocked, then prior state in room_4 with red_door_1 unlocked.
6. At least once holding red_ball_1 or blue_ball_1 in room_2 (but can't be in room_2, so must hold red_ball_1)
7. At least once holding an object and holding yellow_ball_2. (Need to pick yellow_ball_2)
8. At least once yellow_door_1 unlocked. (Step 3c)
9. If yellow_door_1 unlocked, then prior state in front of red_door_1 and blue_ball_1 in room_4.
10. At least once grey_door_1 is locked. (Initially locked, but maybe toggled again)
11. If grey_door_1 is locked in state s, then in s or later, holding some object.
12. At least once in front of empty. (Maybe after dropping an object)
13. At least once in front of yellow_ball_2. (Need to gotoobject yellow_ball_2)

Also, the goal is to be in front of a yellow door (yellow_door_1) that's unlocked.

So putting it all together:

Plan Steps:

1. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2 (satisfy constraint 1)
2. gotoobject green_box_1 room_1 (satisfy constraint 2's consequent)
3. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_3
4. toggle purple_door_1 (unlock)
5. gotoroom room_1 room_3 purple_door_1 (now in room_3)
6. gotoobject yellow_ball_2 room_3 (satisfy constraint 13)
7. pick yellow_ball_2 room_3 (satisfy constraint 7: holding some object and yellow_ball_2)
8. drop yellow_ball_2 room_3 (to free hands)
9. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_3 (to pick it up for constraint 6)
10. pick red_ball_1 room_3 (now holding red_ball_1, satisfying constraint 6)
11. gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_4
12. toggle red_door_1 (unlock)
13. gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_1 (now in room_4)
14. drop red_ball_1 room_4 (to free hands)
15. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_2 (front of yellow_door_1)
16. Now, to satisfy constraint 9: before unlocking yellow_door_1, must have been in front of red_door_1 (step 11) and blue_ball_1 in room_4. But blue_ball_1 is still in room_1. So need to bring it to room_4. But how?

Wait, this is a problem. To satisfy constraint 9, when we unlock yellow_door_1 (step 16 toggle), we need to have had a prior state where we were in front of red_door_1 (step 11) and blue_ball_1 is in room_4. But blue_ball_1 is in room_1. So perhaps we need to go back to room_1, pick up blue_ball_1, bring it to room_4, then proceed.

So steps after step 14:

15. gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_3 (to go back)
16. toggle red_door_1 (unlocked)
17. gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_1 (back to room_3)
18. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_1
19. toggle purple_door_1 (already unlocked)
20. gotoroom room_3 room_1 purple_door_1 (back to room_1)
21. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_1
22. pick blue_ball_1 room_1 (now holding it)
23. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_3
24. gotoroom room_1 room_3 purple_door_1 (to room_3)
25. gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_4
26. gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_1 (to room_4)
27. drop blue_ball_1 room_4 (now blue_ball_1 is in room_4)
28. Now, step 15: gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_2
29. toggle yellow_door_1 (unlock)
   - Now, this satisfies constraint 8. But before this, in step 25, when we were in front of red_door_1 (step 25?), and blue_ball_1 was dropped in room_4 (step 27), so the prior state (step 25: in front of red_door_1) and blue_ball_1 in room_4 (after step 27). So that satisfies constraint 9.

30. Now, the goal is to be in front of yellow_door_1 (which we are after step 28) and it's unlocked (after step 29). So step 29 is the final action.

But also, need to satisfy constraint 4: grey_door_1 must be unlocked at least once. So after step 1, grey_door_1 is locked. To satisfy constraint 4, we need to toggle it to unlocked. But when? We can't go to room_2, so we can only toggle it from room_1.

But according to constraint 5, if we unlock grey_door_1, then before that, we must have been in room_4 with red_door_1 unlocked. So after step 27 (blue_ball_1 in room_4), we can go back to room_1 and unlock grey_door_1.

But after step 27, we are in room_4. So steps after 27:

28. gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_3
29. gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_1 (to room_3)
30. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_1
31. gotoroom room_3 room_1 purple_door_1 (back to room_1)
32. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2
33. toggle grey_door_1 (unlock it; now constraint 4 is satisfied)
   - But before this, in step 27, we were in room_4 with red_door_1 unlocked (after step 12, red_door_1 is unlocked, and in room_4 after step 13). So when we unlock grey_door_1 in step 33, the prior state (step 13) is being in room_4 with red_door_1 unlocked. So that satisfies constraint 5.

34. Then, need to satisfy constraint 10: grey_door_1 must be locked in some state. Initially locked, then unlocked in step 33. To have it locked again, we need to toggle it again. But constraint 10 requires at least one state where it's locked. Since it starts locked and we unlock it in step 33, the initial state and steps before 33 satisfy constraint 10. So perhaps we don't need to lock it again.

But constraint 10 says "grey_door_1 is locked" must hold in at least one state. Since it starts locked, that's satisfied in the initial state. So no need to toggle it again.

But constraint 11 says if grey_door_1 is locked in state s, then in s or after, you are holding an object. Initially, grey_door_1 is locked, and you are not holding anything. So this violates constraint 11 unless in the initial state, you are holding an object. But you are not. So we need to ensure that whenever grey_door_1 is locked, you are holding an object in that state or later.

Wait, constraint 11: "If grey_door_1 is locked in some state s, then expression 'you are holding some object' must hold at s or at some state after s".

In the initial state, grey_door_1 is locked, and you are not holding anything. So this is a problem. To satisfy constraint 11, after the initial state, you must hold an object at some point. But you need to pick up an object later. So as long as you eventually pick up an object, the constraint is satisfied. Because in the initial state, s0: grey_door_1 is locked, and you are not holding anything. Then, in a later state s1, you pick up an object. So s0 is a state where grey_door_1 is locked, and in s1 (after s0), you are holding an object. So that satisfies the constraint.

In our plan, step 7: pick yellow_ball_2. So after the initial state, in step 7, you hold an object. So constraint 11 is satisfied for the initial state.

Another time when grey_door_1 is locked: after step 33, you unlock it. If you lock it again, then you must have an object. But we don't need to lock it again. The only time grey_door_1 is locked is initially and after any toggles that lock it. But if you don't toggle it again, it remains unlocked. So the initial state is the only time it's locked, and constraint 11 is satisfied by step 7.

Now, constraint 12: at least once in front of empty. After dropping an object, you can use gotoempty. For example, after step 8 (drop yellow_ball_2), gotoempty. Or after step 14 (drop red_ball_1), gotoempty.

Let's adjust step 15 (after step 14):

15. gotoempty (satisfy constraint 12)
16. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_2
17. toggle yellow_door_1 (unlock)
18. Now, in front of yellow_door_1, which is unlocked. This is the goal.

But also need to make sure all other constraints are met. Let's check all:

1. Step 1: front of grey_door_1. ✅
2. Step 1 and 2: after front of grey_door_1, front of green_box_1. ✅
3. Never in room_2. ✅
4. Step 33: grey_door_1 is unlocked. ✅
5. Step 33 (unlock grey_door_1) is preceded by step 13 (in room_4 with red_door_1 unlocked). ✅
6. Step 10: holding red_ball_1. ✅
7. Step 7: holding yellow_ball_2. ✅
8. Step 17: yellow_door_1 unlocked. ✅
9. Step 17: before that, step 25 (front of red_door_1) and step 27 (blue_ball_1 in room_4). ✅
10. Initial state: grey_door_1 locked. ✅
11. Initial state's constraint satisfied by step 7. ✅
12. Step 15: gotoempty. ✅
13. Step 6: front of yellow_ball_2. ✅

Additionally, after step 33 (unlock grey_door_1), we need to lock it again if needed? No, because constraint 10 just needs at least one state where it's locked (initial state).

Wait, but after step 33, grey_door_1 is unlocked. But the initial state is still a state where it's locked. So constraint 10 is satisfied.

Now, the final steps to achieve the goal: after step 17, you are in front of yellow_door_1 (room_4) and it's unlocked. So that's the goal.

But wait, after step 17, you are in front of yellow_door_1 (step 16: gotodoor, then step 17: toggle). The effect of toggle is to unlock it, and you remain in front of it. So that state meets the goal.

So the complete plan would be:

1. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2
2. gotoobject green_box_1 room_1
3. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_3
4. toggle purple_door_1
5. gotoroom room_1 room_3 purple_door_1
6. gotoobject yellow_ball_2 room_3
7. pick yellow_ball_2 room_3
8. drop yellow_ball_2 room_3
9. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_3
10. pick red_ball_1 room_3
11. gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_4
12. toggle red_door_1
13. gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_1
14. drop red_ball_1 room_4
15. gotoempty
16. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_2
17. toggle yellow_door_1

But wait, in step 15 (gotoempty), we are in front of empty, satisfying constraint 12. Then step 16: goto yellow_door_1, step 17: toggle to unlock.

But we also need to bring blue_ball_1 to room_4 for constraint 9. Oh no! In the current plan, blue_ball_1 is still in room_1. So when we toggle yellow_door_1 (step 17), the prior state must have been in front of red_door_1 (which is step 11) and blue_ball_1 in room_4. But blue_ball_1 is not in room_4. So this violates constraint 9.

So we need to adjust the plan to move blue_ball_1 to room_4 before toggling yellow_door_1.

So after step 14, we need to go back to room_1, pick up blue_ball_1, and bring it to room_4.

So inserting steps after step 14:

14. drop red_ball_1 room_4
15. gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_3
16. toggle red_door_1 (already unlocked)
17. gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_1 (room_3)
18. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_1
19. toggle purple_door_1 (already unlocked)
20. gotoroom room_3 room_1 purple_door_1 (room_1)
21. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_1
22. pick blue_ball_1 room_1
23. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_3
24. toggle purple_door_1 (unlocked)
25. gotoroom room_1 room_3 purple_door_1 (room_3)
26. gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_4
27. toggle red_door_1 (unlocked)
28. gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_1 (room_4)
29. drop blue_ball_1 room_4
30. gotoempty (satisfy constraint 12)
31. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_2
32. toggle yellow_door_1

Now, when we toggle yellow_door_1 (step 32), the prior state must have been in front of red_door_1 (step 26) and blue_ball_1 in room_4 (after step 29). This satisfies constraint 9.

But this makes the plan very long. Let's check all constraints again with this extended plan.

But this might exceed the optimal plan length. However, the problem requires an optimal plan, which is the shortest possible. So perhaps there's a shorter way.

Wait, maybe instead of moving blue_ball_1, can we use another object? No, because constraint 9 requires blue_ball_1 to be in room_4. So we have to move it.

Alternative approach: After unlocking purple_door_1 and red_door_1, go to room_4, then return to room_1 to get blue_ball_1, bring it to room_4, then unlock yellow_door_1.

But this requires multiple back-and-forth steps.

Let's try to outline the optimal path:

1. Handle grey_door_1 and green_box_1 constraints early.
2. Unlock doors to reach room_4.
3. Bring blue_ball_1 to room_4.
4. Unlock yellow_door_1.

But the steps would be:

1. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2
2. gotoobject green_box_1 room_1
3. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_3
4. toggle purple_door_1
5. gotoroom room_1 room_3 purple_door_1
6. gotoobject yellow_ball_2 room_3
7. pick yellow_ball_2 room_3 (constraint 7)
8. drop yellow_ball_2 room_3
9. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_3
10. pick red_ball_1 room_3 (constraint 6)
11. gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_4
12. toggle red_door_1
13. gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_1 (now in room_4)
14. drop red_ball_1 room_4
15. gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_3
16. gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_1 (back to room_3)
17. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_1
18. gotoroom room_3 room_1 purple_door_1 (back to room_1)
19. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_1
20. pick blue_ball_1 room_1
21. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_3
22. gotoroom room_1 room_3 purple_door_1 (room_3)
23. gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_4
24. gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_1 (room_4)
25. drop blue_ball_1 room_4 (now constraint 9's blue_ball_1 is in room_4)
26. gotoempty (constraint 12)
27. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_2
28. toggle yellow_door_1 (constraint 8)
29. Now, in front of yellow_door_1 unlocked, goal achieved.

But also need to satisfy constraint 4 and 5:

Constraint 4: grey_door_1 must be unlocked at least once. So we need to toggle it after step 1.

Insert after step 2:

3. toggle grey_door_1 (unlock it)
But wait, after step 1, you are in front of grey_door_1. So step 3 can be toggle grey_door_1 (unlocking it). Then, step 4 onwards.

But then, according to constraint 5, unlocking grey_door_1 (step 3) must be preceded by being in room_4 with red_door_1 unlocked. But at step 3, we haven't even unlocked purple_door_1 yet. So this is impossible. So the only way to satisfy constraint 4 and 5 is to first reach room_4 with red_door_1 unlocked, then go back and unlock grey_door_1.

So steps:

After step 25 (blue_ball_1 in room_4), go back to room_1 and unlock grey_door_1.

26. gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_3
27. gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_1
28. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_1
29. gotoroom room_3 room_1 purple_door_1 (room_1)
30. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2
31. toggle grey_door_1 (unlock)
32. Now, grey_door_1 is unlocked (constraint 4 satisfied). Before this, step 13 (in room_4 with red_door_1 unlocked). So constraint 5 is satisfied.

33. Then, go back to room_4 to unlock yellow_door_1.

33. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_3
34. gotoroom room_1 room_3 purple_door_1
35. gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_4
36. gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_1
37. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_2
38. toggle yellow_door_1 (unlock)
39. Now, in front of yellow_door_1 unlocked, goal achieved.

But this is getting extremely long. There must be a more optimal way.

Alternative idea: After step 13 (in room_4), instead of dropping red_ball_1 and going back, maybe carry blue_ball_1 earlier.

Wait, blue_ball_1 is in room_1. So after unlocking purple_door_1 and going to room_3, maybe return to room_1 to pick up blue_ball_1 and take it to room_4.

Let's try:

1. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2
2. gotoobject green_box_1 room_1
3. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_3
4. toggle purple_door_1
5. gotoroom room_1 room_3 purple_door_1 (room_3)
6. gotoobject yellow_ball_2 room_3
7. pick yellow_ball_2 room_3
8. drop yellow_ball_2 room_3
9. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_3
10. pick red_ball_1 room_3
11. gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_4
12. toggle red_door_1
13. gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_1 (room_4)
14. drop red_ball_1 room_4
15. gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_3
16. gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_1 (room_3)
17. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_1
18. gotoroom room_3 room_1 purple_door_1 (room_1)
19. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_1
20. pick blue_ball_1 room_1
21. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_3
22. gotoroom room_1 room_3 purple_door_1 (room_3)
23. gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_4
24. gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_1 (room_4)
25. drop blue_ball_1 room_4
26. gotoempty
27. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_2
28. toggle yellow_door_1
29. Now, unlock grey_door_1 to satisfy constraint 4. But how?

After step 28, we need to unlock grey_door_1. But we're in room_4. So:

30. gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_3
31. gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_1
32. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_1
33. gotoroom room_3 room_1 purple_door_1
34. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2
35. toggle grey_door_1 (unlock)
36. Now, grey_door_1 is unlocked (constraint 4). Before this, we were in room_4 with red_door_1 unlocked (step 24), so constraint 5 is satisfied.

This plan has 36 steps, which is very long. The problem asks for an optimal plan with minimal length. There must be a shorter way.

Alternative approach: Combine steps where possible. For example, after picking up red_ball_1 in room_3, carry it to room_4 and drop it there. Then, use that as the object for constraint 6 (holding red_ball_1). Then, when returning to room_1, pick up blue_ball_1 and carry it to room_4. But perhaps there's a way to carry both objects, but since you can only hold one at a time, that's not possible.

Wait, constraint 6 requires at least one state where either holding red_ball_1 or blue_ball_1 is in room_2. But since room_2 is forbidden, the only option is to hold red_ball_1. So as long as we pick up red_ball_1 at some point, constraint 6 is satisfied. Which we do in step 10.

So maybe we don't need to drop red_ball_1 in room_4. Maybe we can carry it through, but then we need to drop it to pick up blue_ball_1.

Alternatively, after step 10 (pick red_ball_1), go to room_4, drop it, then return to room_1 to get blue_ball_1. But this adds steps.

Another idea: Use the blue_box_1 in room_2. But we can't enter room_2. So no.

Hmm. This is very complex. Let's try to find the minimal steps.

Alternative plan focusing on essential steps:

- Unlock purple_door_1 and red_door_1 to reach room_4.
- Bring blue_ball_1 to room_4.
- Unlock yellow_door_1.
- Unlock grey_door_1 after being in room_4.

But also handle constraints:

1. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2
2. gotoobject green_box_1 room_1
3. toggle grey_door_1 (unlock) → but this violates constraint 5 unless we have been in room_4 with red_door_1 unlocked. So can't do this yet.

So, after reaching room_4:

Steps:

1. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2
2. gotoobject green_box_1 room_1
3. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_3
4. toggle purple_door_1
5. gotoroom room_1 room_3 purple_door_1
6. gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_4
7. toggle red_door_1
8. gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_1 (now in room_4)
9. gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_3
10. gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_1 (back to room_3)
11. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_1
12. gotoroom room_3 room_1 purple_door_1 (back to room_1)
13. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_1
14. pick blue_ball_1 room_1
15. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_3
16. gotoroom room_1 room_3 purple_door_1 (room_3)
17. gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_4
18. gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_1 (room_4)
19. drop blue_ball_1 room_4
20. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_2
21. toggle yellow_door_1 (unlock)
22. gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_3
23. gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_1 (room_3)
24. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_1
25. gotoroom room_3 room_1 purple_door_1 (room_1)
26. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2
27. toggle grey_door_1 (unlock)
28. gotoobject green_box_1 room_1 (already done in step 2, but maybe not needed again)
29. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_3
30. gotoroom room_1 room_3 purple_door_1 (room_3)
31. gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_4
32. gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_1 (room_4)
33. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_2
34. toggle yellow_door_1 (already done in step 21)

But this still seems too long. There's a lot of back-and-forth.

Perhaps the minimal steps involve:

- Unlock purple_door_1 and red_door_1.
- Go to room_4.
- Return to room_1 to get blue_ball_1.
- Bring it to room_4.
- Unlock yellow_door_1.
- Unlock grey_door_1.

But each step requires moving between rooms, which takes several actions.

Alternatively, perhaps we can pick up blue_ball_1 early on and carry it through.

For example:

1. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2
2. gotoobject green_box_1 room_1
3. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_1
4. pick blue_ball_1 room_1 (now holding it)
5. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_3
6. toggle purple_door_1 (unlock)
7. gotoroom room_1 room_3 purple_door_1 (room_3, holding blue_ball_1)
8. gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_4
9. toggle red_door_1 (unlock)
10. gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_1 (room_4, still holding blue_ball_1)
11. drop blue_ball_1 room_4 (now blue_ball_1 in room_4)
12. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_2
13. toggle yellow_door_1 (unlock)
14. Now, in front of yellow_door_1 unlocked. Goal achieved.
15. Also, need to satisfy constraint 4 (grey_door_1 unlocked). So after step 11, go back to room_1 and unlock grey_door_1.

But this would require:

14. gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_3
15. gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_1 (room_3)
16. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_1
17. gotoroom room_3 room_1 purple_door_1 (room_1)
18. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2
19. toggle grey_door_1 (unlock)

But this adds steps. However, this plan now includes:

- Steps 1-19.

But let's check constraints:

1. Step 1: front of grey_door_1. ✅
2. Step 1 and 2: front of green_box_1 after grey_door_1. ✅
3. Never in room_2. ✅
4. Step 19: grey_door_1 unlocked. ✅
5. Step 19's unlock is preceded by step 11 (blue_ball_1 in room_4) and step 9 (red_door_1 unlocked). But need to check if step 19 is after being in room_4. Yes, after step 11 (in room_4), then steps 14-17 back to room_1. So step 19's unlock of grey_door_1 is preceded by being in room_4 with red_door_1 unlocked. ✅
6. Step 4: holding blue_ball_1. But constraint 6 requires holding red_ball_1 or blue_ball_1 in room_2. Since blue_ball_1 is in room_4 after step 11, but during step 4-11, it's being carried. So the state where blue_ball_1 is in room_2 never happens, but step 4-11: holding blue_ball_1. But constraint 6 is satisfied by holding blue_ball_1 (as long as it's held at some point). Wait, no: constraint 6 says "At least one of the following conditions is true: you are holding red_ball_1, blue_ball_1 is in room_2". Since room_2 is forbidden, the only way is to hold red_ball_1. But in this plan, we never hold red_ball_1. So this plan violates constraint 6.

Ah, right! So we need to pick up red_ball_1 at some point.

So modifying the plan:

After step 11 (drop blue_ball_1 in room_4), go to room_3 to pick up red_ball_1.

12. gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_3
13. gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_1 (room_3)
14. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_3
15. pick red_ball_1 room_3 (now holding it, satisfying constraint 6)
16. drop red_ball_1 room_3 (optional)
17. gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_4
18. gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_1 (room_4)
19. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_2
20. toggle yellow_door_1 (unlock)
21. Now, goal achieved.

But then we still need to unlock grey_door_1, which requires going back to room_1.

This is getting too long again. I think this problem requires a lot of steps to satisfy all constraints, but there might be a more optimal path I'm missing.

Perhaps the key is to find an order where multiple constraints are satisfied with fewer steps.

For example, when in room_3, pick up both yellow_ball_2 and red_ball_1 in sequence, satisfying constraints 7 and 6.

Then, when in room_4, ensure blue_ball_1 is there for constraint 9.

But this requires careful planning.

Final attempt to outline an optimal plan:

1. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2 (constraint 1)
2. gotoobject green_box_1 room_1 (constraint 2)
3. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_3
4. toggle purple_door_1 (unlock)
5. gotoroom room_1 room_3 purple_door_1 (room_3)
6. gotoobject yellow_ball_2 room_3 (constraint 13)
7. pick yellow_ball_2 room_3 (constraint 7)
8. drop yellow_ball_2 room_3 (free hands)
9. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_3
10. pick red_ball_1 room_3 (constraint 6)
11. gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_4
12. toggle red_door_1 (unlock)
13. gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_1 (room_4)
14. drop red_ball_1 room_4
15. gotoempty (constraint 12)
16. gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_3
17. gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_1 (room_3)
18. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_1
19. gotoroom room_3 room_1 purple_door_1 (room_1)
20. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_1
21. pick blue_ball_1 room_1 (now holding it)
22. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_3
23. gotoroom room_1 room_3 purple_door_1 (room_3)
24. gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_4
25. gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_1 (room_4)
26. drop blue_ball_1 room_4 (constraint 9's blue_ball_1 in room_4)
27. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_2
28. toggle yellow_door_1 (unlock) (constraint 8)
29. Now, goal achieved (in front of yellow_door_1 unlocked)
30. Also, need to satisfy constraint 4 (grey_door_1 unlocked). So return to room_1:
31. gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_3
32. gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_1 (room_3)
33. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_1
34. gotoroom room_3 room_1 purple_door_1 (room_1)
35. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2
36. toggle grey_door_1 (unlock) (constraint 4)

But this plan is very long. The problem asks for an optimal plan, which is the shortest possible. I'm probably missing a more efficient path.

Perhaps the key is to toggle grey_door_1 after being in room_4 and red_door_1 unlocked, but without needing to go back and forth multiple times.

Let me try one last approach:

1. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2 (constraint 1)
2. gotoobject green_box_1 room_1 (constraint 2)
3. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_3
4. toggle purple_door_1 (unlock)
5. gotoroom room_1 room_3 purple_door_1 (room_3)
6. gotoobject yellow_ball_2 room_3 (constraint 13)
7. pick yellow_ball_2 room_3 (constraint 7)
8. drop yellow_ball_2 room_3
9. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_3
10. pick red_ball_1 room_3 (constraint 6)
11. gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_4
12. toggle red_door_1 (unlock)
13. gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_1 (room_4)
14. drop red_ball_1 room_4
15. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_1 → but blue_ball_1 is in room_1. So need to go back.

Wait, can't directly go from room_4 to room_1. Need to go through room_3.

16. gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_3
17. gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_1 (room_3)
18. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_1
19. gotoroom room_3 room_1 purple_door_1 (room_1)
20. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_1
21. pick blue_ball_1 room_1
22. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_3
23. gotoroom room_1 room_3 purple_door_1 (room_3)
24. gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_4
25. gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_1 (room_4)
26. drop blue_ball_1 room_4 (now constraint 9 satisfied)
27. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_2
28. toggle yellow_door_1 (unlock)
29. Now, goal achieved. Also need to unlock grey_door_1.

30. gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_3
31. gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_1 (room_3)
32. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_1
33. gotoroom room_3 room_1 purple_door_1 (room_1)
34. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2
35. toggle grey_door_1 (unlock) (constraint 4)

This plan has 35 steps. I'm not sure if this is the shortest possible, but given the constraints, it might be necessary. However, the optimal plan should be shorter. Let's try to minimize steps by combining actions.

For example, after step 13 (in room_4 with red_ball_1), instead of dropping it immediately, carry it to toggle yellow_door_1. But we need to drop it to pick up blue_ball_1.

Alternatively, use blue_ball_1 earlier.

But time is limited, so I'll proceed with the best possible plan I can devise, even if it's long.
