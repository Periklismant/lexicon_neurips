Okay, let's try to figure this out. The goal is to be in front of a yellow door that's unlocked. The initial state has all doors locked. So, I need to unlock a yellow door. The doors available are grey_door_1, purple_door_1, yellow_door_1, red_door_1. Looking at their colors: yellow_door_1 is yellow. So that's the door we need.

First, the agent starts in room_1. The yellow_door_1 connects room_2 and room_4. But room_1 is connected to room_3 via purple_door_1 and to room_2 via grey_door_1. Since all doors are locked, the agent can't move between rooms unless they can unlock the doors. But to unlock a door, you need to be in front of it, which requires being in a room connected by that door. 

So, the agent is in room_1. The yellow_door_1 is between room_2 and room_4. To get to yellow_door_1, the agent needs to be in room_2 or room_4. But room_2 is connected to room_1 via grey_door_1, which is locked. So maybe the agent needs to first unlock grey_door_1. Wait, but how? To toggle a door, you need to be in front of it, which requires being in a room connected by that door. So to unlock grey_door_1, the agent needs to go to grey_door_1's location. But grey_door_1 connects room_1 and room_2. So the agent is in room_1, can go to grey_door_1 (if not blocked), then toggle it to unlock. Wait, but in the initial state, is there any object blocking the doors?

Looking at the initial state: in room_1, there's yellow_ball_1, green_box_1, blue_ball_1. So these objects are in room_1. But the doors are in the room connections. The 'goto door' action requires that there's no object blocking the position in front of the door. So the agent can go to grey_door_1 from room_1 only if there's no object blocking it. But the problem is, the initial state doesn't mention any objects blocking doors. Wait, the problem's initial state doesn't state any door being blocked. So maybe the doors are not blocked. So the agent can go to the door, toggle it, then go through.

Wait, but the agent is in room_1. To get to room_2, they need to use grey_door_1. But grey_door_1 is locked. So first, the agent can go to grey_door_1 (since they're in room_1, which is connected via grey_door_1), then toggle it to unlock. Then go to room_2. Once in room_2, the yellow_door_1 connects to room_4. But yellow_door_1 is locked. So the agent needs to go to yellow_door_1 from room_2, toggle it, but then the goal is to be in front of a yellow door (yellow_door_1) that's unlocked. So maybe after unlocking yellow_door_1, the agent just stays in front of it.

Wait, but how does the agent get to yellow_door_1? Let's outline the steps:

1. Start in room_1.
2. Go to grey_door_1 (which connects room_1 and room_2) using 'gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2'. Precondition: in a room connected by the door (room_1 is connected via grey_door_1, so okay) and no object blocking. Since no objects are mentioned blocking doors, this is possible.
3. Toggle grey_door_1 to unlock it. Now grey_door_1 is unlocked.
4. Use 'gotoroom room_1 room_2 grey_door_1' to move to room_2.
5. Now in room_2, go to yellow_door_1 (which connects room_2 and room_4) using 'gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_4'.
6. Toggle yellow_door_1 to unlock it.
7. Now, the agent is in front of yellow_door_1, which is yellow and now unlocked. So that satisfies the goal: there exists a door d (yellow_door_1) that is yellow, the agent is in front of it, and it's not locked.

But wait, after step 6, the agent is in front of yellow_door_1. Because after toggling, they stay in front of it. So the final state would have the agent in front of yellow_door_1, which is now unlocked. That meets the goal. So the plan would be:

gotoobject might not be needed. Let's check the steps again.

Starting in room_1. The first step is to go to grey_door_1. So 'gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2'. Then 'toggle grey_door_1' (since preconditions are met). Then 'gotoroom room_1 room_2 grey_door_1' to move to room_2. Then in room_2, go to yellow_door_1: 'gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_4'. Then 'toggle yellow_door_1' to unlock it. Now, the agent is in front of yellow_door_1, which is yellow and unlocked. That's the goal.

Wait, but the initial state says all doors are locked. So after toggling yellow_door_1, it becomes unlocked. Then the agent is in front of it, which satisfies the goal. So the steps would be:

1. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2
2. toggle grey_door_1
3. gotoroom room_1 room_2 grey_door_1
4. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_4
5. toggle yellow_door_1

But after step 5, the door is unlocked, and the agent is in front of it. So that's the goal. So that's a 5-step plan.

Is there a shorter plan? Let's see. Is there another way to reach a yellow door that's unlocked? The only yellow door is yellow_door_1. So the agent must get in front of it, unlock it. But to unlock it, they have to toggle it, which requires being in front of it. So steps 4 and 5 are necessary. To get to room_2, the agent has to go through grey_door_1, which is initially locked. So steps 1-3 are necessary. Then steps 4-5. So total 5 steps. Is there a way to avoid going to room_2? Let's see.

Alternatively, maybe the agent can go from room_1 to room_3 via purple_door_1. But purple_door_1 is locked. So same problem. To unlock purple_door_1, the agent would need to go to it from room_1. Let's say:

1. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_3
2. toggle purple_door_1
3. gotoroom room_1 room_3 purple_door_1
But then, from room_3, how to get to yellow_door_1? The yellow_door_1 is between room_2 and room_4. Room_3 is connected to room_4 via red_door_1. So maybe go from room_3 to room_4 via red_door_1. But red_door_1 is locked. So the agent would need to unlock red_door_1 as well, which is in room_3 and room_4. So that's a longer path. So this approach would take more steps. So the first approach (through room_2) is better.

So the initial plan of 5 steps is optimal. Let's check each action's preconditions.

Step 1: gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2. Preconditions: agent is in room_1 (yes) and no object blocking the position in front of grey_door_1 in room_1. Since room_1 has objects but they don't block the door, as per initial state. So allowed.

Step 2: toggle grey_door_1. Precondition: agent is in front of grey_door_1 (after step 1, yes). So allowed.

Step 3: gotoroom room_1 room_2 grey_door_1. Preconditions: current room is room_1 (yes), adjacent to room_2 (yes), door is unlocked (after toggle, yes). So allowed. After this, agent is in room_2, not in front of any object/door.

Step 4: gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_4. Agent is in room_2, which is connected via yellow_door_1. No objects blocking (room_2 has green_ball_1 and blue_box_1, but not blocking the door). So allowed.

Step 5: toggle yellow_door_1. Agent is in front of it, so allowed. This unlocks the door.

So the final state has agent in front of yellow_door_1 (which is now unlocked). That satisfies the goal. So this plan works and is optimal.
