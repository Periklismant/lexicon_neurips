Let me carefully analyze this planning problem.

First, I need to understand the environment and the current state:
- 4 rooms arranged in a square formation:
  - room_1 (north-west)
  - room_2 (south-west)
  - room_3 (north-east)
  - room_4 (south-east)
- 4 doors connecting the rooms:
  - grey_door_1 connects room_1 and room_2
  - purple_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3
  - yellow_door_1 connects room_2 and room_4
  - red_door_1 connects room_3 and room_4
- Currently, all doors are locked
- I start in room_1
- Various balls and boxes are distributed across the rooms

The goal is to reach a situation where:
- There is a yellow door (which would be yellow_door_1)
- I am in front of this yellow door
- This door is unlocked

Now let's consider the constraints:

1. I must be in front of grey_door_1 at some point.
2. After being in front of grey_door_1, I must also be in front of green_box_1 with grey_door_1 still locked.
3. I can never be in room_2.
4. grey_door_1 must be unlocked at some point.
5. Before grey_door_1 is unlocked, I must be in room_4 with red_door_1 unlocked.
6. I must either hold red_ball_1 or have blue_ball_1 in room_2 at some point.
7. I must hold yellow_ball_2 at some point.
8. yellow_door_1 must be unlocked at some point.
9. Before yellow_door_1 is unlocked, I must be in front of red_door_1 with blue_ball_1 in room_4.
10. grey_door_1 must be locked at some point (it starts locked, so this is already satisfied).
11. After grey_door_1 is locked, I must hold some object.
12. I must be in front of an empty position at some point.
13. I must be in front of yellow_ball_2 at some point.

Let me think about how to approach this problem:

Constraint 3 says I can never be in room_2, but I need to unlock yellow_door_1 which connects room_2 and room_4. This means I must unlock yellow_door_1 from room_4, not room_2.

Constraint 5 says that before unlocking grey_door_1, I must be in room_4 with red_door_1 unlocked. So I need to:
1. Go to room_3 (through purple_door_1)
2. Unlock red_door_1
3. Go to room_4
4. Then at some point unlock grey_door_1 (but I can't enter room_2, so I must do this from room_1)

Constraint 9 says that before unlocking yellow_door_1, I must be in front of red_door_1 with blue_ball_1 in room_4. So I need to:
1. Get blue_ball_1 (which starts in room_1)
2. Somehow get it to room_4
3. Be in front of red_door_1
4. Then at some point unlock yellow_door_1

The goal is to be in front of yellow_door_1 when it's unlocked. Since I can't be in room_2, I must be in room_4 in front of yellow_door_1.

Let me devise a plan:

1. In room_1, pick up blue_ball_1
2. Go to room_3 through purple_door_1 (unlock it first)
3. Go to red_door_1 and unlock it
4. Go to room_4 through red_door_1
5. Drop blue_ball_1 in room_4 (to satisfy constraint 9)
6. Go back to room_3 through red_door_1
7. Pick up yellow_ball_2 (to satisfy constraint 7)
8. Go back to room_4 through red_door_1
9. Go to yellow_door_1 and unlock it (satisfying constraint 8 and part of constraint 9)
10. At some point, also satisfy constraint 6 (either hold red_ball_1 or have blue_ball_1 in room_2)
11. At some point, unlock grey_door_1 (from room_1)
12. Ensure all other constraints are met

Let me revise this plan to make sure all constraints are satisfied:

First, I need to check if it's even possible to satisfy constraint 6: either hold red_ball_1 or have blue_ball_1 in room_2. Since I can't enter room_2 (constraint 3), I can't directly place blue_ball_1 there. So I must hold red_ball_1 at some point.

I also notice a potential issue with constraint 11: after grey_door_1 is locked, I must hold some object. Since grey_door_1 starts locked, I must hold an object at some point. But we already know I'll need to hold objects for other constraints.

Let's think about this step by step, making sure all constraints are satisfied:

1. First, I need to address constraints 1 and 2: I must be in front of grey_door_1, and after that, I must be in front of green_box_1 with grey_door_1 still locked.
   - I can go to grey_door_1 in room_1
   - Then I can go to green_box_1 in room_1

2. For constraint 11, after grey_door_1 is locked, I must hold some object. grey_door_1 starts locked, so I need to pick up an object.
   - I pick up green_box_1 or any other object in room_1

3. For constraint 9, before unlocking yellow_door_1, I must be in front of red_door_1 with blue_ball_1 in room_4.
   - I'll need to pick up blue_ball_1 from room_1
   - Get to room_3 (through purple_door_1)
   - Get to red_door_1
   - Unlock red_door_1
   - Go to room_4
   - Drop blue_ball_1 in room_4
   - Go back to red_door_1

4. For constraint 5, before unlocking grey_door_1, I must be in room_4 with red_door_1 unlocked.
   - This will be satisfied during step 3

5. For constraint 7, I must hold yellow_ball_2 at some point.
   - I need to pick up yellow_ball_2 from room_3

6. For constraint 6, I must either hold red_ball_1 or have blue_ball_1 in room_2.
   - Since I can't enter room_2, I must hold red_ball_1 (which is in room_3)

7. For constraint 13, I must be in front of yellow_ball_2 at some point.
   - This will be satisfied when I pick up yellow_ball_2

8. For constraint 12, I must be in front of an empty position at some point.
   - I can do this at any time by using the gotoempty action

Now, let me create a detailed plan:

1. In room_1:
   - gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2 (satisfies constraint 1)
   - gotoobject green_box_1 room_1 (satisfies constraint 2)
   - pick green_box_1 room_1 (satisfies constraint 11)
   - gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_3
   - toggle purple_door_1 (unlock it)
   - gotoroom room_1 room_3 purple_door_1

2. In room_3:
   - gotoobject yellow_ball_2 room_3 (satisfies constraint 13)
   - drop green_box_1 room_3
   - pick yellow_ball_2 room_3 (satisfies constraint 7)
   - gotoobject red_ball_1 room_3
   - drop yellow_ball_2 room_3
   - pick red_ball_1 room_3 (satisfies constraint 6)
   - gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_4
   - toggle red_door_1 (unlock it)
   - gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_1 (now in room_4 with red_door_1 unlocked, will help satisfy constraint 5)

3. In room_4:
   - gotoempty (satisfies constraint 12)
   - drop red_ball_1 room_4
   - gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_1

4. Back in room_3:
   - gotoroom room_3 room_1 purple_door_1

5. Back in room_1:
   - gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_1
   - pick blue_ball_1 room_1
   - gotoroom room_1 room_3 purple_door_1

6. In room_3 again:
   - gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_1

7. In room_4 again:
   - drop blue_ball_1 room_4 (blue_ball_1 is now in room_4)
   - gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_3 (satisfies part of constraint 9)
   - gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_2
   - toggle yellow_door_1 (unlock it, satisfies constraint 8 and completes constraint 9)
   - gotoroom room_4 room_1 ??? (we need to get back to room_1 to unlock grey_door_1)

Wait, we hit a problem. We need to get from room_4 back to room_1, but we can't go through room_2 due to constraint 3, and there's no direct door from room_4 to room_1. We would need to go through room_3, so we need:

7. In room_4 again:
   - drop blue_ball_1 room_4 (blue_ball_1 is now in room_4)
   - gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_3 (satisfies part of constraint 9)
   - gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_1
   - gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_2
   - toggle yellow_door_1 (unlock it, satisfies constraint 8 and completes constraint 9)

Wait, we still have a problem: we can't be in front of yellow_door_1 in room_4 if we're in room_3. Let me rethink this.

After going from room_4 to room_3, we need to go to room_1, and then unlock grey_door_1 (satisfying constraint 4). But before that, we need to be in front of yellow_door_1 and unlock it.

The problem is that yellow_door_1 connects room_2 and room_4, and we can't enter room_2. So we must be in room_4 to be in front of yellow_door_1. But we need to satisfy constraint 9 first: we need to be in front of red_door_1 with blue_ball_1 in room_4.

Let me revise the plan:

1. In room_1:
   - gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2 (satisfies constraint 1)
   - gotoobject green_box_1 room_1 (satisfies constraint 2)
   - pick green_box_1 room_1 (satisfies constraint 11)
   - gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_3
   - toggle purple_door_1 (unlock it)
   - gotoroom room_1 room_3 purple_door_1

2. In room_3:
   - gotoobject yellow_ball_2 room_3 (satisfies constraint 13)
   - drop green_box_1 room_3
   - pick yellow_ball_2 room_3 (satisfies constraint 7)
   - gotoobject red_ball_1 room_3
   - drop yellow_ball_2 room_3
   - pick red_ball_1 room_3 (satisfies constraint 6)
   - gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_4
   - toggle red_door_1 (unlock it)
   - gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_1 (now in room_4 with red_door_1 unlocked, helps satisfy constraint 5)

3. In room_4:
   - gotoempty (satisfies constraint 12)
   - drop red_ball_1 room_4
   - gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_1

4. Back in room_3:
   - gotoroom room_3 room_1 purple_door_1

5. Back in room_1:
   - gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_1
   - pick blue_ball_1 room_1
   - gotoroom room_1 room_3 purple_door_1

6. In room_3 again:
   - gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_1

7. In room_4 again:
   - drop blue_ball_1 room_4 (blue_ball_1 is now in room_4)
   - gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_3 (we're now in front of red_door_1 with blue_ball_1 in room_4, satisfying part of constraint 9)
   - gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_1
   - gotoroom room_3 room_1 purple_door_1
   - gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2
   - toggle grey_door_1 (unlock it, satisfying constraint 4, and we've satisfied constraint 5 before doing this)
   - gotoroom room_1 room_3 purple_door_1
   - gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_1
   - gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_2
   - toggle yellow_door_1 (unlock it, satisfying constraint 8 and complete constraint 9)

Great, we're now in front of yellow_door_1 when it's unlocked, which is our goal! Let me check that all constraints are satisfied:

1. ✓ I was in front of grey_door_1
2. ✓ After being in front of grey_door_1, I was in front of green_box_1 with grey_door_1 still locked
3. ✓ I was never in room_2
4. ✓ grey_door_1 was unlocked
5. ✓ Before grey_door_1 was unlocked, I was in room_4 with red_door_1 unlocked
6. ✓ I held red_ball_1
7. ✓ I held yellow_ball_2
8. ✓ yellow_door_1 was unlocked
9. ✓ Before yellow_door_1 was unlocked, I was in front of red_door_1 with blue_ball_1 in room_4
10. ✓ grey_door_1 was locked (it started locked)
11. ✓ After grey_door_1 was locked, I held green_box_1
12. ✓ I was in front of an empty position
13. ✓ I was in front of yellow_ball_2

It looks like all constraints are satisfied. Let me finalize the plan:

```
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2
gotoobject green_box_1 room_1
pick green_box_1 room_1
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_3
toggle purple_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_3 purple_door_1
gotoobject yellow_ball_2 room_3
drop green_box_1 room_3
pick yellow_ball_2 room_3
gotoobject red_ball_1 room_3
drop yellow_ball_2 room_3
pick red_ball_1 room_3
gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_4
toggle red_door_1
gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_1
gotoempty
drop red_ball_1 room_4
gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_1
gotoroom room_3 room_1 purple_door_1
gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_1
pick blue_ball_1 room_1
gotoroom room_1 room_3 purple_door_1
gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_1
drop blue_ball_1 room_4
gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_3
gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_1
gotoroom room_3 room_1 purple_door_1
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2
toggle grey_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_3 purple_door_1
gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_1
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_2
toggle yellow_door_1
```

Actually, I realize there's a slight oversight in my reasoning. When I gotoroom, I'm not in front of any door or object after the action. Let me make sure I go in front of yellow_door_1 after I unlock it:

```
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2
gotoobject green_box_1 room_1
pick green_box_1 room_1
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_3
toggle purple_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_3 purple_door_1
gotoobject yellow_ball_2 room_3
drop green_box_1 room_3
pick yellow_ball_2 room_3
gotoobject red_ball_1 room_3
drop yellow_ball_2 room_3
pick red_ball_1 room_3
gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_4
toggle red_door_1
gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_1
gotoempty
drop red_ball_1 room_4
gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_1
gotoroom room_3 room_1 purple_door_1
gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_1
pick blue_ball_1 room_1
gotoroom room_1 room_3 purple_door_1
gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_1
drop blue_ball_1 room_4
gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_3
gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_1
gotoroom room_3 room_1 purple_door_1
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2
toggle grey_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_3 purple_door_1
gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_1
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_2
toggle yellow_door_1
```

This ensures that at the end of the plan, I'm in front of yellow_door_1 and it's unlocked, which is our goal.

Actually, let me quickly review constraints 5 and 9 to make sure I fully understood them.

Constraint 5: "If expression 'grey_door_1 is not locked' holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: 'The following conditions are all true: "you are in room_4", "red_door_1 is not locked"'"

This means that before I unlock grey_door_1, I must have been in room_4 at some point with red_door_1 unlocked. In my plan, I'm in room_4 with red_door_1 unlocked from steps 15-18, and I don't unlock grey_door_1 until step 28. So this constraint is satisfied.

Constraint 9: "If expression 'yellow_door_1 is not locked' holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: 'The following conditions are all true: "you are in front of red_door_1", "blue_ball_1 is in room_4"'"

This means that before I unlock yellow_door_1, I must have been in front of red_door_1 with blue_ball_1 in room_4. In my plan, I drop blue_ball_1 in room_4 at step 23, then go in front of red_door_1 at step 24. I don't unlock yellow_door_1 until step 33. So this constraint is also satisfied.

Our final plan is:

```
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2
gotoobject green_box_1 room_1
pick green_box_1 room_1
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_3
toggle purple_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_3 purple_door_1
gotoobject yellow_ball_2 room_3
drop green_box_1 room_3
pick yellow_ball_2 room_3
gotoobject red_ball_1 room_3
drop yellow_ball_2 room_3
pick red_ball_1 room_3
gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_4
toggle red_door_1
gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_1
gotoempty
drop red_ball_1 room_4
gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_1
gotoroom room_3 room_1 purple_door_1
gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_1
pick blue_ball_1 room_1
gotoroom room_1 room_3 purple_door_1
gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_1
drop blue_ball_1 room_4
gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_3
gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_1
gotoroom room_3 room_1 purple_door_1
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2
toggle grey_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_3 purple_door_1
gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_1
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_2
toggle yellow_door_1
```

Great! The final result satisfies all constraints and achieves the goal.

Actually, I just realized that I need to optimize this plan. I'll look for any unnecessary actions:

1. After dropping red_ball_1 in room_4, I immediately go to room_3, then room_1, pick up blue_ball_1, and return to room_4. I could optimize this by picking up blue_ball_1 before going to room_3 initially.

Let me revise the plan:

```
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2
gotoobject green_box_1 room_1
pick green_box_1 room_1
gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_1
drop green_box_1 room_1
pick blue_ball_1 room_1
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_3
toggle purple_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_3 purple_door_1
gotoobject yellow_ball_2 room_3
drop blue_ball_1 room_3
pick yellow_ball_2 room_3
gotoobject red_ball_1 room_3
drop yellow_ball_2 room_3
pick red_ball_1 room_3
gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_4
toggle red_door_1
gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_1
gotoempty
drop red_ball_1 room_4
pick blue_ball_1 room_3 # Wait, this doesn't work because we're in room_4
```

Oh, this won't work because blue_ball_1 is now in room_3, not room_1.

Let me revise the original plan, focusing on making it optimal:

```
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2  # Satisfying constraint 1
gotoobject green_box_1 room_1  # Satisfying constraint 2
pick green_box_1 room_1  # Satisfying constraint 11
gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_1  # Getting blue_ball_1 for constraint 9
drop green_box_1 room_1  # Need to drop to pick up blue_ball_1
pick blue_ball_1 room_1  # Getting blue_ball_1 for constraint 9
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_3
toggle purple_door_1  # Unlocking purple_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_3 purple_door_1
gotoobject yellow_ball_2 room_3  # Going to yellow_ball_2 for constraints 7 and 13
drop blue_ball_1 room_3  # Need to drop to pick up yellow_ball_2
pick yellow_ball_2 room_3  # Satisfying constraint 7
gotoempty  # Satisfying constraint 12
drop yellow_ball_2 room_3  # Need to drop to pick up other objects
gotoobject red_ball_1 room_3
pick red_ball_1 room_3  # Satisfying constraint 6
gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_4
toggle red_door_1  # Unlocking red_door_1
gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_1  # Now in room_4 with red_door_1 unlocked (for constraint 5)
drop red_ball_1 room_4
gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_3  # Blue_ball_1 is in room_3, not room_4
pick blue_ball_1 room_3  # Wait, I can't do this because I'm in room_4
```

I've hit the same issue. I can't optimize by picking up blue_ball_1 earlier because I need it to be in room_4 for constraint 9.

Let me go back to the original plan and check if there are other optimizations:

```
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2  # Satisfying constraint 1
gotoobject green_box_1 room_1  # Satisfying constraint 2
pick green_box_1 room_1  # Satisfying constraint 11
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_3
toggle purple_door_1  # Unlocking purple_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_3 purple_door_1
gotoobject yellow_ball_2 room_3  # Satisfying constraint 13
drop green_box_1 room_3
pick yellow_ball_2 room_3  # Satisfying constraint 7
gotoobject red_ball_1 room_3
drop yellow_ball_2 room_3
pick red_ball_1 room_3  # Satisfying constraint 6
gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_4
toggle red_door_1  # Unlocking red_door_1
gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_1  # Now in room_4 with red_door_1 unlocked (for constraint 5)
gotoempty  # Satisfying constraint 12
drop red_ball_1 room_4
gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_1
gotoroom room_3 room_1 purple_door_1
gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_1
pick blue_ball_1 room_1
gotoroom room_1 room_3 purple_door_1
gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_1
drop blue_ball_1 room_4  # blue_ball_1 is now in room_4
gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_3  # in front of red_door_1 with blue_ball_1 in room_4 (for constraint 9)
gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_1
gotoroom room_3 room_1 purple_door_1
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2
toggle grey_door_1  # Unlocking grey_door_1 (satisfying constraint 4, and we've satisfied constraint 5 before)
gotoroom room_1 room_3 purple_door_1
gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_1
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_2
toggle yellow_door_1  # Unlocking yellow_door_1 (satisfying constraint 8 and complete constraint 9)
```

I think this plan is already quite optimized. I'm not seeing any obvious unnecessary actions. The constraints force a specific sequence of room visits and object manipulations. Going from room_4 to room_1 and back to room_4 might seem inefficient, but it's necessary due to the constraints.

I'll review the constraints one more time:

Constraint 3 says we can never be in room_2. This means we must unlock yellow_door_1 from room_4, not room_2.

Constraint 5 says that before unlocking grey_door_1, we must be in room_4 with red_door_1 unlocked. In our plan, we enter room_4 with red_door_1 unlocked at step 15, and we don't unlock grey_door_1 until step 28.

Constraint 9 says that before unlocking yellow_door_1, we must be in front of red_door_1 with blue_ball_1 in room_4. In our plan, we drop blue_ball_1 in room_4 at step 24, go in front of red_door_1 at step 25, and don't unlock yellow_door_1 until step 33.

Constraint 11 says that after grey_door_1 is locked, we must hold some object. grey_door_1 starts locked, and we pick up green_box_1 right after being in front of grey_door_1 and green_box_1.

All the other constraints are also satisfied by our plan. I think this plan is as optimized as it can be given the constraints.

One small optimization might be to combine some steps when possible:

```
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2  # Satisfying constraint 1
gotoobject green_box_1 room_1  # Satisfying constraint 2
pick green_box_1 room_1  # Satisfying constraint 11
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_3
toggle purple_door_1  # Unlocking purple_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_3 purple_door_1
gotoempty  # Satisfying constraint 12
drop green_box_1 room_3
gotoobject yellow_ball_2 room_3  # Satisfying constraint 13
pick yellow_ball_2 room_3  # Satisfying constraint 7
gotoobject red_ball_1 room_3
drop yellow_ball_2 room_3
pick red_ball_1 room_3  # Satisfying constraint 6
gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_4
toggle red_door_1  # Unlocking red_door_1
gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_1  # Now in room_4 with red_door_1 unlocked (for constraint 5)
drop red_ball_1 room_4
gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_1
gotoroom room_3 room_1 purple_door_1
gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_1
pick blue_ball_1 room_1
gotoroom room_1 room_3 purple_door_1
gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_1
drop blue_ball_1 room_4  # blue_ball_1 is now in room_4
gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_3  # in front of red_door_1 with blue_ball_1 in room_4 (for constraint 9)
gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_1
gotoroom room_3 room_1 purple_door_1
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2
toggle grey_door_1  # Unlocking grey_door_1 (satisfying constraint 4, and we've satisfied constraint 5 before)
gotoroom room_1 room_3 purple_door_1
gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_1
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_2
toggle yellow_door_1  # Unlocking yellow_door_1 (satisfying constraint 8 and complete constraint 9)

I moved the gotoempty action earlier in the plan, but overall, the plan is very similar to the original. I don't see many opportunities for further optimization given the constraints.

Let me ensure the plan satisfies all constraints one final time:

1. ✓ I was in front of grey_door_1 (step 1)
2. ✓ After being in front of grey_door_1, I was in front of green_box_1 with grey_door_1 still locked (steps 1-2)
3. ✓ I was never in room_2 (I only go to rooms 1, 3, and 4)
4. ✓ grey_door_1 was unlocked (step 28)
5. ✓ Before grey_door_1 was unlocked, I was in room_4 with red_door_1 unlocked (step 15)
6. ✓ I held red_ball_1 (step 13)
7. ✓ I held yellow_ball_2 (step 10)
8. ✓ yellow_door_1 was unlocked (step 33)
9. ✓ Before yellow_door_1 was unlocked, I was in front of red_door_1 with blue_ball_1 in room_4 (steps 24-25)
10. ✓ grey_door_1 was locked (it started locked)
11. ✓ After grey_door_1 was locked, I held green_box_1 (step 3)
12. ✓ I was in front of an empty position (step 7)
13. ✓ I was in front of yellow_ball_2 (step 9)

The plan satisfies all constraints and achieves the goal.

drop blue_ball_1 room_4
gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_3
gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_1
gotoroom room_3 room_1 purple_door_1
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2
toggle grey_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_3 purple_door_1
gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_1
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_2
toggle yellow_door_1
```

This is the final optimized plan.
