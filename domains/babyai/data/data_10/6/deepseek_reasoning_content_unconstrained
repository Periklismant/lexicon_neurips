Okay, let's see. The goal is to have a red door that's unlocked, and I need to be in front of it. The initial state has all doors locked. So, first, I need to find a red door. Looking at the doors, red_door_1 is red. It connects room_1 and room_3. But right now, I'm in room_4. How can I get to red_door_1?

Hmm. Starting in room_4. The doors from room_4 are purple_door_1 (connects to room_2) and green_door_1 (connects to room_3). Both are locked. So I need to unlock them? Wait, but all doors are initially locked. So to get through a door, I need to toggle it first. But to toggle a door, I have to be in front of it. But to get in front of a door, I need to be in a room connected by that door, and there's no object blocking the position in front of the door.

Wait, let's check the initial positions. In room_4, there's red_box_2. So the doors in room_4 are purple_door_1 (connecting to room_2) and green_door_1 (connecting to room_3). Are there any objects blocking those doors? The initial state doesn't mention any blocking, but the "blocking" is part of the effects. Wait, the problem says that the preconditions for "goto door" include that there's no object blocking the position in front of d in the current room. So if there's an object in front of the door, you can't go there. But how do objects block doors? Maybe when they are placed in front of the door. Since the initial state doesn't say any objects are blocking doors, except maybe if objects are in front. Wait, the initial state doesn't mention any positions, so maybe we assume that objects are placed in positions that don't block doors unless stated. Hmm. Maybe the initial positions of objects don't block doors unless specified. So, perhaps I can go to the doors in room_4 as long as there's nothing in front of them.

In room_4, there's red_box_2. But if it's not in front of a door, then I can go to the door. So let's assume that the red_box_2 isn't blocking the doors. So I can go to the door.

So, first step: I need to get to red_door_1, which is in room_1 and room_3. But I'm in room_4. So the path would be room_4 -> room_3 via green_door_1, but it's locked. So I need to unlock green_door_1. But to do that, I need to be in front of it. So from room_4, I can go to green_door_1 (since it's connecting room_4 and room_3). So, first, go to green_door_1 in room_4. Then toggle it to unlock. Then go through to room_3. Once in room_3, I can go to red_door_1 (since room_3 is connected to room_1 via red_door_1). Then toggle red_door_1 to unlock it. Then be in front of it. Wait, but the goal is to have a red door (which is red_door_1) that's unlocked and I'm in front of it. So once I unlock red_door_1 and am in front of it, that would satisfy the goal.

But how to get there. Let's plan step by step.

Start in room_4. To get to room_3, need to use green_door_1. But green_door_1 is locked. So:

1. Go to green_door_1 in room_4 (gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3)
2. Toggle green_door_1 (unlocks it)
3. Go to room_3 from room_4 via green_door_1 (gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1)
Now in room_3. Then need to get to red_door_1, which connects room_3 and room_1. But red_door_1 is locked. So:
4. Go to red_door_1 in room_3 (gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1)
5. Toggle red_door_1 (unlocks it)
6. Now, I need to be in front of red_door_1, but after toggling, I'm already in front of it. Wait, when I perform the toggle action, I have to be in front of the door. So after step 4, I'm in front of red_door_1. Then step 5 toggles it to unlocked. So after that, I'm still in front of red_door_1. So the goal is achieved: there's a red door (red_door_1), I'm in front of it, and it's unlocked. So that would satisfy the goal.

But wait, the initial plan steps would be:

- gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3
- toggle green_door_1
- gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1
- gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1
- toggle red_door_1

Then after step 5, the red_door_1 is unlocked, and I'm in front of it. That meets the goal.

But let's verify each step's preconditions.

Starting in room_4.

1. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3: Preconditions: I'm in a room connected by green_door_1 (room_4 is connected via green_door_1 to room_3). Also, no object is blocking the position in front of green_door_1 in room_4. Since room_4 has red_box_2, but unless it's in front of the door, which isn't stated, so allowed. So this action is valid.

2. toggle green_door_1: Precondition is that I'm in front of it. After step 1, I'm in front of green_door_1. So valid. Toggling it will unlock it.

3. gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1: Preconditions: current room is room_4, adjacent to room_3 via green_door_1. Door is unlocked (after step 2). So yes. Action valid. After this, I'm in room_3, not in front of any object.

4. gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1: Preconditions: in room_3, which is connected via red_door_1 to room_1. Also, no object blocking the door's position in room_3. The initial state in room_3 has red_box_1. If red_box_1 is not in front of red_door_1, then allowed. So assuming it's allowed, this action is valid.

5. toggle red_door_1: Precondition is being in front of it. After step 4, yes. Toggling unlocks it. Now, red_door_1 is unlocked, and I'm in front of it. So goal achieved.

So the plan would be these five steps. But wait, the initial step count: from room_4, after unlocking green_door_1, moving to room_3, then moving to the door red_door_1, and unlocking it. That's five actions. But maybe there's a shorter path.

Alternatively, is there another red door? The doors are blue_door_1 (blue), red_door_1 (red), purple_door_1 (purple), green_door_1 (green). So the only red door is red_door_1. So that's the target.

Alternatively, could I go through other doors? Let's see. Starting in room_4. Another door is purple_door_1 connecting to room_2. If I go through purple_door_1, but it's locked. So need to unlock it. But that's more steps, perhaps.

For example:

1. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_2
2. toggle purple_door_1 (unlock)
3. gotoroom room_4 room_2 purple_door_1
Now in room_2. Then from room_2, blue_door_1 connects to room_1. But blue_door_1 is locked. So need to unlock it. But that's blue, not red. So even if I go to room_1, then red_door_1 is connecting to room_3. But then to get to red_door_1 from room_1, need to unlock red_door_1 as well. So that path would be longer.

So the original path through room_3 is better. So five steps. Is that the shortest?

Wait, perhaps after step 3, when in room_3, I can immediately go to red_door_1 and toggle it. Let's count:

1. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3
2. toggle green_door_1
3. gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1 (now in room_3)
4. gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1
5. toggle red_door_1

Yes, five steps. But is there a way to combine steps? For example, after step 1, you're in front of green_door_1. Then toggle it (step 2). Then gotoroom (step 3). Then gotodoor red_door_1 (step4), toggle (step5). That's five actions. Is there a way to do it in fewer steps?

Alternatively, after toggling green_door_1, when moving to room_3, maybe I don't need to go to the door again. Wait, when you use gotoroom, you leave the current room and enter the new room. After moving to room_3, you are not in front of any object or door. So to get to red_door_1 in room_3, you need to do gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1. Then toggle. So that's necessary.

So five steps. Is there any possible shorter path? Let's see.

Alternatively, if there's a way to unlock red_door_1 without going to room_3. But red_door_1 is in room_1 and room_3. So to unlock it, you have to be in front of it from either room. But starting in room_4, you can't reach room_1 directly unless you go through room_3 or room_2. Either way, you need to unlock doors.

So the initial plan seems optimal. So the answer should be these five steps.
