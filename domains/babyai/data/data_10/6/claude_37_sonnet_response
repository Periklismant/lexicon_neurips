Let me first understand the problem:

We have a 2D gridworld with 4 rooms arranged in a square. The rooms are connected by doors, and we need to solve a planning problem. The rooms may contain boxes and balls of different colors, and doors connecting the rooms also have colors.

Here's a visual representation of the rooms:
```
| room_1 | room_3 |
|--------|--------|
| room_2 | room_4 |
```

The doors connecting the rooms are:
- blue_door_1: room_1 and room_2
- red_door_1: room_1 and room_3
- purple_door_1: room_2 and room_4
- green_door_1: room_3 and room_4

The initial state:
- We're in room_4
- red_ball_1 and yellow_ball_1 are in room_1
- green_ball_1, grey_box_1, green_box_1, and blue_ball_1 are in room_2
- red_box_1 is in room_3
- red_box_2 is in room_4
- All doors are locked
- We've visited room_4 (we're currently there)

The goal:
- Find a door d that is red, we're in front of it, and it's unlocked.

From the goal, we need to unlock red_door_1 (which connects room_1 and room_3) and be in front of it.

Now, let's go through the constraints:

1. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'green_door_1 is not locked'"
   This means we need to unlock green_door_1 at some point.

2. "If expression 'green_door_1 is not locked' holds in some state s, then expression 'The following conditions are all true: "you are holding red_ball_1", "you are in front of green_box_1"' must hold at s or at some state after s"
   This means after unlocking green_door_1, we need to pick up red_ball_1 and go in front of green_box_1.

3. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'red_door_1 is locked'"
   red_door_1 is already locked in the initial state.

4. "If expression 'red_door_1 is locked' holds in some state s, then expression 'you are in front of green_ball_1' must hold at s or at some state after s"
   This means after red_door_1 is locked (it already is in the initial state), we need to go in front of green_ball_1.

5. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'red_door_1 is not locked'"
   This means we need to unlock red_door_1 at some point (which is also required for the goal).

6. "If expression 'red_door_1 is not locked' holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: 'The following conditions are all true: "you are in front of red_box_2", "you are holding grey_box_1"'"
   This means before unlocking red_door_1, we need to be in front of red_box_2 while holding grey_box_1.

7. "The following expression must hold in every state: 'you are not in room_3'"
   We cannot enter room_3 at any point.

8. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'you are in room_4'"
   We're already in room_4 in the initial state.

9. "If expression 'you are in room_4' holds in some state s, then expression 'you are holding some object' must hold at s or at some state after s"
   This means we need to pick up some object after being in room_4 (or while in room_4).

10. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'you are holding grey_box_1'"
    We need to pick up grey_box_1 at some point, and from constraint 6, we need to hold it while being in front of red_box_2 before unlocking red_door_1.

11. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'you are in room_1'"
    We need to visit room_1 at some point.

Great, now I understand the constraints better.

Let me think about how to solve this problem, taking into consideration all the constraints:

1. We start in room_4.
2. From constraint 9, after being in room_4, we need to hold some object.
3. Constraint 10 says we need to hold grey_box_1 at some point. grey_box_1 is in room_2, so we need to get to room_2 first.
4. From constraint 6, before unlocking red_door_1, we need to be in front of red_box_2 while holding grey_box_1. red_box_2 is in room_4.
5. From constraint 7, we can't enter room_3 at any point, so we need to unlock red_door_1 from room_1 side.
6. Constraint 11 says we need to be in room_1 at some point.
7. From the goal, we need to be in front of red_door_1 when it's unlocked.

Let's formulate a plan:

1. We start in room_4.
2. Go to purple_door_1 connecting room_4 and room_2.
3. Unlock purple_door_1.
4. Move to room_2 through the now unlocked purple_door_1.
5. Go to grey_box_1 in room_2 and pick it up.
6. Go to green_ball_1 in room_2 to satisfy constraint 4.
7. Go back to purple_door_1 (from the room_2 side).
8. Go to room_4 through purple_door_1.
9. Go to red_box_2 in room_4 (while still holding grey_box_1) to satisfy constraint 6.
10. Go to green_door_1 connecting room_4 and room_3.
11. Unlock green_door_1 to satisfy constraint 1.
12. Go to blue_door_1 connecting room_2 and room_1.
13. Unlock blue_door_1.
14. Go to room_1 through blue_door_1 to satisfy constraint 11.
15. Drop grey_box_1 to free our hands.
16. Go to red_ball_1 in room_1 and pick it up.
17. Go to green_box_1 in room_2 (after going back to room_2 through blue_door_1) to be in front of it while holding red_ball_1 to satisfy constraint 2.
18. Go back to room_1 through blue_door_1.
19. Go to red_door_1 connecting room_1 and room_3.
20. Unlock red_door_1 to satisfy constraint 5 and the goal.

Wait, let's check the constraints and the goal again to make sure the plan is valid:

Constraint 1: We unlock green_door_1 in step 11.
Constraint 2: After unlocking green_door_1, we need to hold red_ball_1 and be in front of green_box_1. We achieve this in step 17 after completing step 11.
Constraint 3: red_door_1 is already locked in the initial state.
Constraint 4: After red_door_1 is locked, we need to go in front of green_ball_1. We achieve this in step 6.
Constraint 5: We unlock red_door_1 in step 20.
Constraint 6: Before unlocking red_door_1, we need to be in front of red_box_2 while holding grey_box_1. We achieve this in step 9, which is before step 20.
Constraint 7: We never enter room_3 in our plan.
Constraint 8: We start in room_4, so this constraint is already satisfied.
Constraint 9: After being in room_4, we need to hold some object. We pick up grey_box_1 in step 5, which is after being in room_4 in step 1.
Constraint 10: We hold grey_box_1 in steps 5-15.
Constraint 11: We're in room_1 in steps 14-19.

Goal: We're in front of red_door_1 and it's unlocked in step 20.

But wait, I made a mistake in my plan. Let me redo it:

1. We start in room_4.
2. Go to purple_door_1 connecting room_4 and room_2.
3. Unlock purple_door_1.
4. Move to room_2 through the now unlocked purple_door_1.
5. Go to green_ball_1 in room_2 to satisfy constraint 4.
6. Go to grey_box_1 in room_2 and pick it up.
7. Go back to purple_door_1 (from the room_2 side).
8. Go to room_4 through purple_door_1.
9. Go to red_box_2 in room_4 (while still holding grey_box_1) to satisfy constraint 6.
10. Go to green_door_1 connecting room_4 and room_3.
11. Unlock green_door_1 to satisfy constraint 1.
12. Go to purple_door_1 connecting room_4 and room_2.
13. Go to room_2 through purple_door_1.
14. Go to blue_door_1 connecting room_2 and room_1.
15. Unlock blue_door_1.
16. Go to room_1 through blue_door_1 to satisfy constraint 11.
17. Drop grey_box_1 to free our hands.
18. Go to red_ball_1 in room_1 and pick it up.
19. Go to blue_door_1 connecting room_1 and room_2.
20. Go to room_2 through blue_door_1.
21. Go to green_box_1 in room_2 (while holding red_ball_1) to satisfy constraint 2.
22. Go to blue_door_1 connecting room_2 and room_1.
23. Go to room_1 through blue_door_1.
24. Go to red_door_1 connecting room_1 and room_3.
25. Unlock red_door_1 to satisfy constraint 5 and the goal.

Actually, I realize that if I'm already in room_4 with the grey_box_1, then I can go to red_box_2 in room_4 to satisfy constraint 6, and also to green_box_1 to satisfy constraint 2. I think the plan can be simplified. Let me try again:

Actually, I need to be careful about the constraints and their dependencies. Let's break down the constraints and see what order we need to satisfy them:

Constraints that need to be satisfied in specific states:
1. At some point, green_door_1 needs to be unlocked.
2. After unlocking green_door_1, we need to hold red_ball_1 and be in front of green_box_1.
3. At some point, red_door_1 needs to be locked (already true in the initial state).
4. After red_door_1 is locked, we need to go in front of green_ball_1.
5. At some point, red_door_1 needs to be unlocked.
6. Before unlocking red_door_1, we need to be in front of red_box_2 while holding grey_box_1.
7. We can never enter room_3.
8. At some point, we need to be in room_4 (already true in the initial state).
9. After being in room_4, we need to hold some object.
10. At some point, we need to hold grey_box_1.
11. At some point, we need to be in room_1.

Goal: We need to end up in front of a red door (which is red_door_1) and that door needs to be unlocked.

So, the overall dependencies are:
- We need to go to room_2 to pick up grey_box_1 and go in front of green_ball_1.
- Then, while holding grey_box_1, we need to go in front of red_box_2 in room_4.
- At some point, we need to unlock green_door_1.
- After unlocking green_door_1, we need to pick up red_ball_1 and go in front of green_box_1.
- Finally, we need to unlock red_door_1 and be in front of it.

This gives us a clearer order of operations:
1. Go to room_2 and pick up grey_box_1.
2. Go in front of green_ball_1 in room_2 to satisfy constraint 4.
3. Go back to room_4 and go in front of red_box_2 while holding grey_box_1 to satisfy constraint 6.
4. Unlock green_door_1 to satisfy constraint 1.
5. Go to room_1 to satisfy constraint 11.
6. Drop grey_box_1 to free our hands.
7. Pick up red_ball_1 in room_1.
8. Go to room_2 and go in front of green_box_1 while holding red_ball_1 to satisfy constraint 2.
9. Go back to room_1 and go in front of red_door_1.
10. Unlock red_door_1 to satisfy constraint 5 and the goal.

But wait, we need to think about how to move between rooms. All doors are initially locked, so we need to unlock them as we go. Let's incorporate that into the plan:

1. We start in room_4.
2. Go to purple_door_1 connecting room_4 and room_2.
3. Toggle purple_door_1 to unlock it.
4. Move to room_2 through the now unlocked purple_door_1.
5. Go to green_ball_1 in room_2 to satisfy constraint 4.
6. Go to grey_box_1 in room_2 and pick it up.
7. Go back to purple_door_1 (from the room_2 side).
8. Go to room_4 through purple_door_1.
9. Go to red_box_2 in room_4 (while still holding grey_box_1) to satisfy constraint 6.
10. Go to green_door_1 connecting room_4 and room_3.
11. Toggle green_door_1 to unlock it and satisfy constraint 1.
12. Go to purple_door_1 connecting room_4 and room_2.
13. Go to room_2 through purple_door_1.
14. Go to blue_door_1 connecting room_2 and room_1.
15. Toggle blue_door_1 to unlock it.
16. Go to room_1 through blue_door_1 to satisfy constraint 11.
17. Go to a empty position in room_1.
18. Drop grey_box_1 to free our hands.
19. Go to red_ball_1 in room_1 and pick it up.
20. Go to blue_door_1 connecting room_1 and room_2.
21. Go to room_2 through blue_door_1.
22. Go to green_box_1 in room_2 (while holding red_ball_1) to satisfy constraint 2.
23. Go to blue_door_1 connecting room_2 and room_1.
24. Go to room_1 through blue_door_1.
25. Go to red_door_1 connecting room_1 and room_3.
26. Toggle red_door_1 to unlock it and satisfy constraint 5 and the goal.

Let's check if this is a valid plan:
- We never enter room_3 (constraint 7)
- We pick up an object (grey_box_1) after being in room_4 (constraint 9)
- We hold grey_box_1 at some point (constraint 10)
- We are in room_1 at some point (constraint 11)
- red_door_1 is locked in the initial state (constraint 3)
- We go in front of green_ball_1 after red_door_1 is locked (constraint 4)
- We go in front of red_box_2 while holding grey_box_1 before unlocking red_door_1 (constraint 6)
- We unlock green_door_1 at some point (constraint 1)
- We hold red_ball_1 and go in front of green_box_1 after unlocking green_door_1 (constraint 2)
- We unlock red_door_1 at some point (constraint 5)
- We end up in front of red_door_1 when it's unlocked (goal)

Great! This seems like a valid plan that satisfies all constraints and the goal. Let's convert it to the format specified in the description.

Actually, I realize that the format for the actions is not quite right. Let me fix that:

1. We start in room_4.
2. Go in front of purple_door_1 connecting room_4 and room_2: "gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_2"
3. Toggle purple_door_1 to unlock it: "toggle purple_door_1"
4. Move to room_2 through the now unlocked purple_door_1: "gotoroom room_4 room_2 purple_door_1"
5. Go in front of green_ball_1 in room_2 to satisfy constraint 4: "gotoobject green_ball_1 room_2"
6. Go in front of grey_box_1 in room_2: "gotoobject grey_box_1 room_2"
7. Pick up grey_box_1: "pick grey_box_1 room_2"
8. Go in front of purple_door_1 (from the room_2 side): "gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_4"
9. Go to room_4 through purple_door_1: "gotoroom room_2 room_4 purple_door_1"
10. Go in front of red_box_2 in room_4 (while still holding grey_box_1) to satisfy constraint 6: "gotoobject red_box_2 room_4"
11. Go in front of green_door_1 connecting room_4 and room_3: "gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3"
12. Toggle green_door_1 to unlock it and satisfy constraint 1: "toggle green_door_1"
13. Go in front of purple_door_1 connecting room_4 and room_2: "gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_2"
14. Go to room_2 through purple_door_1: "gotoroom room_4 room_2 purple_door_1"
15. Go in front of blue_door_1 connecting room_2 and room_1: "gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1"
16. Toggle blue_door_1 to unlock it: "toggle blue_door_1"
17. Go to room_1 through blue_door_1 to satisfy constraint 11: "gotoroom room_2 room_1 blue_door_1"
18. Go in front of an empty position in room_1: "gotoempty"
19. Drop grey_box_1 to free our hands: "drop grey_box_1 room_1"
20. Go in front of red_ball_1 in room_1: "gotoobject red_ball_1 room_1"
21. Pick up red_ball_1: "pick red_ball_1 room_1"
22. Go in front of blue_door_1 connecting room_1 and room_2: "gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2"
23. Go to room_2 through blue_door_1: "gotoroom room_1 room_2 blue_door_1"
24. Go in front of green_box_1 in room_2 (while holding red_ball_1) to satisfy constraint 2: "gotoobject green_box_1 room_2"
25. Go in front of blue_door_1 connecting room_2 and room_1: "gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1"
26. Go to room_1 through blue_door_1: "gotoroom room_2 room_1 blue_door_1"
27. Go in front of red_door_1 connecting room_1 and room_3: "gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3"
28. Toggle red_door_1 to unlock it and satisfy constraint 5 and the goal: "toggle red_door_1"

Let me refine the plan even more to make sure it's correct. The main actions are:

1. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_2
2. toggle purple_door_1
3. gotoroom room_4 room_2 purple_door_1
4. gotoobject green_ball_1 room_2
5. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_2
6. pick grey_box_1 room_2
7. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_4
8. gotoroom room_2 room_4 purple_door_1
9. gotoobject red_box_2 room_4
10. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3
11. toggle green_door_1
12. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_2
13. gotoroom room_4 room_2 purple_door_1
14. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1
15. toggle blue_door_1
16. gotoroom room_2 room_1 blue_door_1
17. gotoempty
18. drop grey_box_1 room_1
19. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_1
20. pick red_ball_1 room_1
21. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2
22. gotoroom room_1 room_2 blue_door_1
23. gotoobject green_box_1 room_2
24. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1
25. gotoroom room_2 room_1 blue_door_1
26. gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3
27. toggle red_door_1

```
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_2
toggle purple_door_1
gotoroom room_4 room_2 purple_door_1
gotoobject green_ball_1 room_2
gotoobject grey_box_1 room_2
pick grey_box_1 room_2
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_4
gotoroom room_2 room_4 purple_door_1
gotoobject red_box_2 room_4
gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3
toggle green_door_1
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_2
gotoroom room_4 room_2 purple_door_1
gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1
toggle blue_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_1 blue_door_1
gotoempty
drop grey_box_1 room_1
gotoobject red_ball_1 room_1
pick red_ball_1 room_1
gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2
gotoroom room_1 room_2 blue_door_1
gotoobject green_box_1 room_2
gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1
gotoroom room_2 room_1 blue_door_1
gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3
toggle red_door_1
```

This seems like a valid plan that satisfies all the constraints and the goal. Let's check:

- We never enter room_3 (constraint 7)
- We pick up an object (grey_box_1) after being in room_4 (constraint 9)
- We hold grey_box_1 at some point (constraint 10)
- We are in room_1 at some point (constraint 11)
- red_door_1 is locked in the initial state (constraint 3)
- We go in front of green_ball_1 after red_door_1 is locked (constraint 4)
- We go in front of red_box_2 while holding grey_box_1 before unlocking red_door_1 (constraint 6)
- We unlock green_door_1 at some point (constraint 1)
- We hold red_ball_1 and go in front of green_box_1 after unlocking green_door_1 (constraint 2)
- We unlock red_door_1 at some point (constraint 5)
- We end up in front of red_door_1 when it's unlocked (goal)
