Okay, let's tackle this planning problem step by step. So, the goal is to get to a red door that's unlocked and be in front of it. Also, there are a bunch of constraints we need to satisfy. Let me start by understanding all the requirements and the initial state.

First, the initial state: the agent is in room_4. All doors are locked. The doors are blue_door_1 (connecting room_1 and room_2), red_door_1 (connecting room_1 and room_3), purple_door_1 (connecting room_2 and room_4), and green_door_1 (connecting room_3 and room_4). The objects are scattered in different rooms. The agent isn't holding anything initially.

The goal is to have a red door (d) that is unlocked, and the agent is in front of it. The red doors here are red_door_1 and red_box_1/red_box_2 (but boxes aren't doors). Wait, red_door_1 is a door connecting room_1 and room_3. So, the target door must be red_door_1. Because that's the only red door. Wait, looking back: "door red_door_1 is red". So the goal is to have the agent in front of red_door_1, which is unlocked.

But wait, the constraints say that we can never enter room_3. Because one of the constraints is "you are not in room_3" in every state. So room_3 is off-limits. So red_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3. But if we can't go into room_3, then the agent must be in front of red_door_1 from room_1's side. But to unlock red_door_1, we need to toggle it, which requires being in front of it. So the agent must go to room_1, go to red_door_1, unlock it. But wait, red_door_1 is initially locked. So the steps would involve unlocking it. But the agent is starting in room_4. How do they get to room_1?

Looking at the doors: From room_4, the doors are purple_door_1 (connecting to room_2) and green_door_1 (connecting to room_3). But room_3 is forbidden. So the only way out of room_4 is via purple_door_1 to room_2. But purple_door_1 is locked. So first, the agent needs to unlock purple_door_1. But to toggle a door, they need to be in front of it. So they have to be in room_4, go to purple_door_1 (which connects room_4 and room_2), but in room_4, the door is purple_door_1. So the agent can "gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_2" (since they are in room_4), but the door is locked. So they need to toggle it. Wait, the preconditions for gotodoor: you can go to the door if you are in a room connected by it and no object is blocking the position. Are there any objects blocking doors? Let's check the initial state. The initial objects in rooms:

- room_2 has green_ball_1, grey_box_1, green_box_1, blue_ball_1. So if any of these are in front of a door in room_2? The doors in room_2 are blue_door_1 (to room_1) and purple_door_1 (to room_4). So if any objects are blocking those doors, the agent can't go to the door. But the problem states that "there is no object blocking the position in front of d in the room you are currently in". Wait, the initial state doesn't mention any objects blocking doors. So maybe all doors are unblocked initially. So the agent can go to the doors as long as they are in the right room.

So starting in room_4, the agent can go to purple_door_1 (connecting to room_2) by using "gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_2". Then toggle it to unlock. Then go through to room_2. From room_2, they can go to blue_door_1 (connecting to room_1), which is blue and locked. Need to unlock that as well. But blue_door_1 is in room_2. So the agent would need to go to blue_door_1 from room_2, toggle it to unlock, then go to room_1. Once in room_1, go to red_door_1 (connecting to room_3), toggle it to unlock. But wait, the goal is to have the red door (red_door_1) unlocked and be in front of it. But since room_3 is forbidden, the agent must be in room_1 in front of red_door_1. So the plan would involve getting to room_1, unlocking red_door_1, and being in front of it.

But wait, the constraints have several conditions:

Constraints:

1. At least one state where green_door_1 is not locked. But green_door_1 connects room_3 and room_4, and we can't go to room_3. So unlocking green_door_1 would require being in room_4 in front of it. But since room_3 is forbidden, maybe the agent can toggle green_door_1 from room_4. But why would they need to? The goal is about red_door_1. But the constraint says that green_door_1 must be unlocked at least once. So the agent must unlock green_door_1 at some point. But that's in room_4. So maybe the agent needs to go to green_door_1 in room_4, unlock it (but then lock it again?), but the constraint is that it must be not locked in at least one state. So unlocking it once would satisfy that. But the problem is that the agent can't go into room_3, so maybe they can just toggle green_door_1 once.

But when they toggle it, it alternates between locked and unlocked. Since it's initially locked, toggling once would unlock it, which satisfies the constraint. Then, maybe toggle it again to lock it again if needed. But the constraint only requires that in at least one state it's unlocked. So perhaps the agent can unlock green_door_1, then proceed.

But also, the second constraint: if green_door_1 is not locked in some state s, then at s or after, the agent must be holding red_ball_1 and in front of green_box_1. So unlocking green_door_1 (making it not locked) requires that at some point after, the agent is holding red_ball_1 and in front of green_box_1. But green_box_1 is in room_2. So the agent must go to room_2, pick up green_box_1? Wait, but green_box_1 is a box, not a ball. Wait, the objects are boxes and balls. The action "pick" can pick up any object, I think. So the agent can pick up boxes or balls.

But red_ball_1 is in room_1. So the agent needs to get to room_1, pick up red_ball_1, and also be in front of green_box_1 (which is in room_2). So after unlocking green_door_1 (which is in room_4), the agent needs to at some point be holding red_ball_1 and in front of green_box_1. But green_box_1 is in room_2. So the agent needs to be in room_2, in front of green_box_1, while holding red_ball_1. So perhaps after unlocking green_door_1, the agent must go to room_2, get green_box_1's location, go there, then have red_ball_1 in hand. But red_ball_1 is in room_1. So the agent must go to room_1, pick up red_ball_1, then go back to room_2, go to green_box_1, and be in front of it while holding red_ball_1. That seems possible but requires a lot of steps.

Another constraint: At least one state where red_door_1 is locked. But initially, red_door_1 is locked. So that's already satisfied. Wait, the initial state has red_door_1 locked. So the first state (initial) already has red_door_1 locked. So that constraint is already met. But the fourth constraint says that if red_door_1 is locked in some state s, then the agent must be in front of green_ball_1 at s or after. So in the initial state, red_door_1 is locked, so the agent must at some point (now or later) be in front of green_ball_1. Green_ball_1 is in room_2. So the agent must go to room_2 and be in front of green_ball_1.

Another constraint: At least one state where red_door_1 is not locked. So we have to unlock it. But when we unlock it, we have to ensure that in an earlier state, the agent was in front of red_box_2 and holding grey_box_1. Red_box_2 is in room_4. So the agent must at some point be in room_4, in front of red_box_2, holding grey_box_1. Grey_box_1 is in room_2. So the agent needs to pick up grey_box_1 in room_2, then go to room_4, go to red_box_2, and be holding grey_box_1 while in front of red_box_2. Then, after that, unlock red_door_1.

Also, the agent must be in room_4 at least once (they start there, so initial state counts), and whenever they are in room_4, they must be holding something at that state or later. So after being in room_4, they need to pick up something. But since they start in room_4, the initial state counts. So the agent must hold something at some point after being in room_4. Since the initial state is room_4 and they are not holding anything, they must pick up something after that. For example, pick up red_box_2 in room_4, but red_box_2 is a box, so possible. But maybe they need to hold grey_box_1, which is in room_2.

Another constraint: The agent must be holding grey_box_1 in at least one state. So they need to pick up grey_box_1 from room_2.

And the agent must be in room_1 at least once.

Putting all this together, the plan must:

1. Start in room_4. Need to unlock doors to move.

2. Unlock green_door_1 (since it's a constraint to have it unlocked at least once). But since green_door_1 connects room_4 and room_3, and room_3 is forbidden, the agent can only access it from room_4. So go to green_door_1 in room_4, toggle to unlock. Then, according to constraint, after that, the agent must at some point hold red_ball_1 and be in front of green_box_1. But green_box_1 is in room_2, and red_ball_1 is in room_1. So after unlocking green_door_1, the agent needs to go to room_1, pick up red_ball_1, then go to room_2, go to green_box_1, and be in front of it while holding red_ball_1. But that's a lot of steps.

Alternatively, maybe unlock green_door_1, then proceed to room_2 via purple_door_1 (after unlocking it), then go to room_1 via blue_door_1 (unlocking it), pick up red_ball_1, then return to room_2, go to green_box_1, drop the ball there? Wait, but the constraint requires that when green_door_1 is unlocked (at some state), the agent must be holding red_ball_1 and in front of green_box_1 at that state or later. So maybe after unlocking green_door_1, the agent proceeds to room_2, then to room_1, picks up red_ball_1, goes back to room_2, goes to green_box_1, and is in front of it while holding red_ball_1. That would satisfy the constraint.

Also, the agent must be in room_1 at least once, which this path covers.

Another constraint: When red_door_1 is unlocked, there must have been a previous state where the agent was in front of red_box_2 and holding grey_box_1. So to unlock red_door_1 (which is in room_1), the agent needs to toggle it. But to do that, they need to be in front of it. So after unlocking red_door_1 (which is initially locked), the agent toggles it, making it unlocked. But before that unlock, they need to have been in front of red_box_2 (in room_4) and holding grey_box_1. So the agent must have picked up grey_box_1 (from room_2), gone to room_4, gone to red_box_2, then later unlock red_door_1.

So steps could be:

1. From room_4, go to purple_door_1 (room_4 to room_2), but it's locked. So need to toggle it. But to toggle, must be in front of it. So first, gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_2, then toggle it. That unlocks purple_door_1. Then go through to room_2. Now, in room_2.

2. In room_2, need to pick up grey_box_1. So gotoobject grey_box_1 room_2, pick it up. Now holding grey_box_1. Then, drop it somewhere? Wait, no. The constraint is that the agent must have been holding grey_box_1 in at least one state, so picking it up satisfies that. But for the red_door_1 unlock constraint, the agent must have been in front of red_box_2 while holding grey_box_1. So after picking grey_box_1 in room_2, the agent needs to go back to room_4 (via purple_door_1), then gotoobject red_box_2 room_4. So:

3. From room_2, gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_4, then gotoroom room_2 room_4 purple_door_1. Now in room_4. Then gotoobject red_box_2 room_4. Now in front of red_box_2, holding grey_box_1. This satisfies the condition for the red_door_1 unlock.

4. Now, the agent can proceed to unlock red_door_1. But to do that, they need to get to room_1. From room_4, go to room_2 via purple_door_1 (already unlocked). Then from room_2, go to room_1 via blue_door_1, which is locked. So need to unlock blue_door_1. So in room_2, gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1, toggle to unlock. Then gotoroom room_2 room_1 blue_door_1. Now in room_1.

5. In room_1, gotoobject red_ball_1, pick it up. Now holding red_ball_1. Then, need to go to green_box_1 in room_2. So go back to room_2 via blue_door_1. Then gotoobject green_box_1 room_2. Now in front of green_box_1, holding red_ball_1. This satisfies the green_door_1 unlock condition.

6. Now, the agent needs to unlock red_door_1. But red_door_1 is in room_1. So go back to room_1. Wait, they are in room_2. So from room_2, go to room_1 via blue_door_1. Then, gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3. Toggle it to unlock. Now red_door_1 is unlocked. The goal is to be in front of it, which the agent is after gotodoor. So that's the goal state.

But let's check all constraints:

- green_door_1 must be unlocked at least once. When was that done? Wait, in the initial plan steps I thought of, I didn't unlock green_door_1. Oh right, that's another constraint. So the agent needs to toggle green_door_1 in room_4. So adding that step.

So step 0: In room_4, goto green_door_1 (gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3), toggle it to unlock. Now green_door_1 is unlocked. Then, proceed to unlock purple_door_1 as before. But after unlocking green_door_1, the agent must at some point hold red_ball_1 and be in front of green_box_1. So after step 0, the agent needs to eventually pick up red_ball_1 and be in front of green_box_1.

So revised steps:

1. In room_4, go to green_door_1 (gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3), toggle to unlock. Now green_door_1 is unlocked. This satisfies the first constraint.

2. Then, go to purple_door_1 (gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_2), toggle to unlock. Then go to room_2.

3. In room_2, pick up grey_box_1 (gotoobject, pick).

4. Go back to room_4 via purple_door_1, gotoobject red_box_2 (to satisfy the red_door_1 unlock condition). Now, holding grey_box_1 and in front of red_box_2.

5. Then go back to room_2, then to room_1 via blue_door_1 (unlock blue_door_1 first).

6. In room_1, pick up red_ball_1.

7. Go back to room_2, go to green_box_1, now holding red_ball_1 and in front of green_box_1. This satisfies the green_door_1 constraint.

8. Then go to room_1 again, unlock red_door_1 (gotodoor red_door_1, toggle), which is now unlocked, and be in front of it.

But also, the agent must not enter room_3 at any point, which is covered.

Additionally, the agent must be in room_1 at least once (step 5 and 8).

The constraint about being in room_4: the agent starts there, and after step 4, they are in room_4 again. But when they are in room_4, they must be holding something at that state or later. When they are in room_4 in step 4, they are holding grey_box_1. So that's satisfied.

Now, let's check all constraints:

1. green_door_1 is unlocked in step 1: satisfied.

2. If green_door_1 is unlocked (step 1), then at some point after, agent holds red_ball_1 and in front of green_box_1 (steps 6-7): satisfied.

3. red_door_1 is locked initially: constraint requires at least one state where it's locked. Initial state satisfies this.

4. If red_door_1 is locked (initial state), then agent must be in front of green_ball_1 (in room_2) at some point. When agent is in room_2 (steps 2,3,4, etc.), they can go to green_ball_1. For example, after step 3, when holding grey_box_1, before leaving room_2, they can gotoobject green_ball_1. But the current plan steps don't include that. Wait, this is a problem. The fourth constraint says that if red_door_1 is locked in some state s, then agent must be in front of green_ball_1 at s or after. The initial state has red_door_1 locked. So the agent must be in front of green_ball_1 at some point. But in the current steps, they are in room_2 (where green_ball_1 is) but do they go in front of it?

In step 3, after picking grey_box_1, the agent may need to go to green_ball_1. Or, perhaps when moving to room_2, they can go to green_ball_1 first. Let's adjust:

After step 2 (unlock purple_door_1 and go to room_2), the agent can go to green_ball_1, then proceed to pick up grey_box_1. But then, being in front of green_ball_1 satisfies the constraint that if red_door_1 is locked (as it is in the initial state and until step 8), then the agent must be in front of green_ball_1 at some point. So adding:

After step 2: gotoobject green_ball_1 room_2. Then proceed to pick grey_box_1. This way, the agent is in front of green_ball_1, which satisfies the constraint.

So revised steps:

1. goto green_door_1 in room_4, toggle to unlock.

2. goto purple_door_1 in room_4, toggle to unlock.

3. go to room_2 via purple_door_1.

4. goto green_ball_1 in room_2 (satisfy constraint when red_door_1 is locked).

5. goto grey_box_1 in room_2, pick it up.

6. return to room_4 via purple_door_1.

7. goto red_box_2 in room_4 (now holding grey_box_1, in front of red_box_2).

8. go back to room_2 via purple_door_1.

9. goto blue_door_1 in room_2, toggle to unlock.

10. go to room_1 via blue_door_1.

11. goto red_ball_1 in room_1, pick it up.

12. go back to room_2 via blue_door_1.

13. goto green_box_1 in room_2 (now holding red_ball_1, in front of green_box_1).

14. go back to room_1 via blue_door_1.

15. goto red_door_1 in room_1, toggle to unlock.

16. Now in front of red_door_1, which is unlocked.

But need to check if all constraints are met.

Let's verify each constraint:

- Constraint 1: green_door_1 is not locked in step 1. Done.

- Constraint 2: After step 1, agent holds red_ball_1 and is in front of green_box_1 (step 13). Yes.

- Constraint 3: red_door_1 is locked in initial state. Yes.

- Constraint 4: If red_door_1 is locked (initially), then agent is in front of green_ball_1 (step 4). Yes.

- Constraint 5: red_door_1 must be unlocked at least once. Step 15 unlocks it. Yes.

- Constraint 6: When red_door_1 is unlocked (step 15), there must be a prior state where agent was in front of red_box_2 and holding grey_box_1 (step 7). Yes.

- Constraint 7: Never in room_3. All steps avoid room_3. Yes.

- Constraint 8: Agent is in room_4 in steps 1, 2, 6,7. And in those states or later, they hold something. In step 5, they pick up grey_box_1, so after step 5, they are holding something. So when in room_4 (steps 6 and 7), they are holding grey_box_1. Satisfied.

- Constraint 9: Agent holds grey_box_1 in step 5. Yes.

- Constraint 10: Agent is in room_1 in steps 10,11,14,15. Yes.

Now, check if the plan is optimal (shortest possible). Let's count the steps:

1. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3

2. toggle green_door_1

3. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_2

4. toggle purple_door_1

5. gotoroom room_4 room_2 purple_door_1

6. gotoobject green_ball_1 room_2

7. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_2

8. pick grey_box_1 room_2

9. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_4

10. gotoroom room_2 room_4 purple_door_1

11. gotoobject red_box_2 room_4

12. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_2

13. gotoroom room_4 room_2 purple_door_1

14. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1

15. toggle blue_door_1

16. gotoroom room_2 room_1 blue_door_1

17. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_1

18. pick red_ball_1 room_1

19. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2

20. gotoroom room_1 room_2 blue_door_1

21. gotoobject green_box_1 room_2

22. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1

23. gotoroom room_2 room_1 blue_door_1

24. gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3

25. toggle red_door_1

That's 25 steps. But maybe there's a shorter path.

Wait, maybe some steps can be combined. For example, after step 5 (arrive in room_2), the agent can directly goto green_ball_1 (step 6), then goto grey_box_1 (step7), pick it (step8). Then, return to room_4 via purple_door_1 (steps9-10). Then goto red_box_2 (step11). Then return to room_2 (steps12-13). Then goto blue_door_1 (step14), toggle (step15), go to room_1 (step16). Pick red_ball_1 (step17-18). Then go back to room_2 (step19-20), goto green_box_1 (step21). Then go to room_1 (step22-23), goto red_door_1 (step24), toggle (step25). That's 25 steps. Is there a way to optimize?

For example, after picking grey_box_1 in room_2, the agent goes to room_4 to be in front of red_box_2. Then, when returning to room_2, perhaps they don't need to go through purple_door_1 again. But they have to use the door.

Alternatively, can the order of some steps be rearranged to save steps?

Alternatively, perhaps after unlocking green_door_1, the agent can unlock purple_door_1, go to room_2, unlock blue_door_1, then go to room_1, pick red_ball_1, and so on.

But let's think again. The main constraints are:

- Unlock green_door_1 once, then later hold red_ball_1 and be in front of green_box_1.

- When unlocking red_door_1, must have been in front of red_box_2 holding grey_box_1.

- Be in room_1 once.

So maybe a more optimal path:

1. Start in room_4.

2. Unlock green_door_1 (steps: goto green_door_1, toggle).

3. Unlock purple_door_1 (goto purple_door_1, toggle).

4. Go to room_2 via purple_door_1.

5. Pick grey_box_1 (goto grey_box_1, pick).

6. Go back to room_4 (via purple_door_1).

7. Goto red_box_2 (in room_4, now holding grey_box_1).

8. Go back to room_2.

9. Unlock blue_door_1 (goto blue_door_1, toggle).

10. Go to room_1.

11. Pick red_ball_1.

12. Go back to room_2.

13. Goto green_box_1 (now holding red_ball_1).

14. Go back to room_1.

15. Unlock red_door_1 (goto red_door_1, toggle).

But also need to be in front of green_ball_1 after red_door_1 is locked. Since red_door_1 is initially locked, we need to be in front of green_ball_1. So perhaps during step 5, after picking grey_box_1, goto green_ball_1.

So insert after step 5: goto green_ball_1. Then proceed.

This would add steps but satisfy the constraint.

So revised steps:

1. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3

2. toggle green_door_1

3. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_2

4. toggle purple_door_1

5. gotoroom room_4 room_2 purple_door_1

6. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_2

7. pick grey_box_1 room_2

8. gotoobject green_ball_1 room_2

9. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_4

10. gotoroom room_2 room_4 purple_door_1

11. gotoobject red_box_2 room_4

12. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_2

13. gotoroom room_4 room_2 purple_door_1

14. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1

15. toggle blue_door_1

16. gotoroom room_2 room_1 blue_door_1

17. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_1

18. pick red_ball_1 room_1

19. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2

20. gotoroom room_1 room_2 blue_door_1

21. gotoobject green_box_1 room_2

22. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1

23. gotoroom room_2 room_1 blue_door_1

24. gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3

25. toggle red_door_1

This is still 25 steps, but step 8 makes sure the agent is in front of green_ball_1. This satisfies the constraint related to red_door_1 being locked initially.

So this plan meets all constraints and achieves the goal. But is there a way to make it shorter?

For example, after step 7 (picking grey_box_1), can the agent immediately go to green_ball_1 (step 8), then proceed to room_4. Then, after being in front of red_box_2, return to room_2, unlock blue_door_1, etc. Seems necessary.

Alternatively, can the agent after step 5 (room_2) go to green_ball_1 first, then pick grey_box_1? That way, step 5 is goto green_ball_1, step 6 is goto grey_box_1, step7 pick. This would save a step? Let's see:

Original steps 6-8:

6. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_2

7. pick grey_box_1 room_2

8. gotoobject green_ball_1 room_2

New order:

6. gotoobject green_ball_1 room_2

7. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_2

8. pick grey_box_1 room_2

This saves one step (no need for step8 in original plan). Because after step6, the agent is in front of green_ball_1. Then step7 moves to grey_box_1, step8 picks it. Then, step9 goes to purple_door_1.

So steps:

1. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3

2. toggle green_door_1

3. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_2

4. toggle purple_door_1

5. gotoroom room_4 room_2 purple_door_1

6. gotoobject green_ball_1 room_2

7. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_2

8. pick grey_box_1 room_2

9. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_4

10. gotoroom room_2 room_4 purple_door_1

11. gotoobject red_box_2 room_4

12. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_2

13. gotoroom room_4 room_2 purple_door_1

14. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1

15. toggle blue_door_1

16. gotoroom room_2 room_1 blue_door_1

17. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_1

18. pick red_ball_1 room_1

19. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2

20. gotoroom room_1 room_2 blue_door_1

24. gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3

25. toggle red_door_1

Now step6 is goto green_ball_1, step7 goto grey_box_1, step8 pick. This way, after being in front of green_ball_1 (step6), which satisfies the constraint when red_door_1 is locked. Then proceed to pick grey_box_1.

This reduces the steps from 25 to 24? Let's count:

Steps 1-25: no, steps are still 25. Wait, perhaps in the original plan, after step7 (pick), step8 was goto green_ball_1, but in the new plan, steps6-8 are goto green_ball_1, goto grey_box_1, pick. So steps remain the same number. But this way, the agent is in front of green_ball_1 earlier, which satisfies the constraint earlier.

But the constraint requires that if red_door_1 is locked in state s, then the agent is in front of green_ball_1 in s or after. Since red_door_1 is locked in all states until step25, but the agent is in front of green_ball_1 in step6, which is after the initial state. So that's okay.

Another possible optimization: after step11 (in room_4, front of red_box_2), instead of going back to room_2 via purple_door_1, can the agent go to green_door_1 (already unlocked), but room_3 is forbidden. So no. Must use purple_door_1.

Another idea: when the agent is in room_4 after step11, can they go to green_door_1 and toggle it again to lock it? But the constraint only requires that green_door_1 is not locked in at least one state. Unlocking it once suffices.

Another possible optimization: after unlocking green_door_1 and purple_door_1, the agent goes to room_2, handles green_ball_1 and grey_box_1, then to room_4, then back to room_2, then to room_1.

But I think the steps are already minimal. The agent must toggle green_door_1, purple_door_1, blue_door_1, red_door_1. Each requires going to the door and toggling. Each room transition requires a door. So it's hard to shorten further.

Therefore, the final plan should be as outlined, ensuring all constraints are met.
