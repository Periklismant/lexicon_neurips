Alright, I'm tasked with navigating a 2D gridworld, moving through rooms, interacting with objects, and bringing about a specific goal while satisfying a set of constraints. Let's break down the problem and devise a plan.

First, let's understand the initial state:
- I'm in room_4.
- Objects are spread across rooms.
- All doors are locked.

The goal is to:
- Be in room_1.
- Be in front of a red ball in room_1.

There are two red balls (red_ball_1 and red_ball_2) in room_1 initially, so I can choose either of them to accomplish the goal.

Now, let's look at the constraints:
1. At some point, I must be in front of purple_door_1.
2. At some point, grey_door_1 must be unlocked.
3. Before grey_door_1 is unlocked, I must be holding some object.
4. I must never be in room_2.
5. At some point, red_door_1 must be unlocked.
6. At some point, I must be holding some object.
7. At some point, I must be in front of red_door_2.
8. After being in front of red_door_2, I must at some point be holding red_ball_1 or purple_ball_1.
9. At some point, I must be in front of grey_door_1.
10. Before being in front of grey_door_1, I must either have purple_door_1 unlocked or be in room_3.
11. At some point, red_door_2 must be locked.
12. After red_door_2 is locked, I must at some point be holding green_ball_1 or have purple_door_1 unlocked.
13. At some point, I must be holding some object and have purple_door_1 unlocked.
14. At some point, red_door_2 must be unlocked.
15. Before red_door_2 is unlocked, I must be holding some object.

First, let's understand the room layout:
- room_1 (NW) connects to room_2 (SW) via grey_door_1.
- room_1 (NW) connects to room_3 (NE) via red_door_1.
- room_2 (SW) connects to room_4 (SE) via red_door_2.
- room_3 (NE) connects to room_4 (SE) via purple_door_1.

I'm initially in room_4, and I need to reach room_1 to achieve the goal. I can't go through room_2 due to constraint 4, so the path must be room_4 -> room_3 -> room_1.

From the constraints:
- I need to unlock purple_door_1 to go from room_4 to room_3.
- Then, I need to unlock red_door_1 to go from room_3 to room_1.
- Before unlocking grey_door_1, I must be holding an object.
- I must pick up red_ball_1 or purple_ball_1 after being in front of red_door_2.
- I need to be in front of grey_door_1, but before that, I must either have purple_door_1 unlocked or be in room_3.
- I must unlock red_door_2 at some point, and before that, I must be holding some object.

One approach would be:
1. Pick up purple_ball_1 from room_4.
2. Go to purple_door_1 and unlock it.
3. Go from room_4 to room_3.
4. While in room_3, go to red_door_1 and unlock it.
5. Go from room_3 to room_1.
6. Drop purple_ball_1 and go in front of red_ball_1 or red_ball_2 (since both are red balls in room_1).

But let's check if this satisfies all constraints:
- Constraint 1: I'll be in front of purple_door_1. ✓
- Constraint 2: I don't need to unlock grey_door_1 since I don't need to go through it. But the constraint states I must unlock it. I'll need to incorporate this.
- Constraint 3: Before unlocking grey_door_1, I must be holding some object. ✓
- Constraint 4: I'll never be in room_2. ✓
- Constraint 5: I'll unlock red_door_1. ✓
- Constraint 6: I'll pick up purple_ball_1. ✓
- Constraint 7: I need to be in front of red_door_2 at some point. I'll need to incorporate this.
- Constraint 8: After being in front of red_door_2, I need to pick up red_ball_1 or purple_ball_1. ✓
- Constraint 9: I need to be in front of grey_door_1 at some point. I'll need to incorporate this.
- Constraint 10: Before being in front of grey_door_1, I must either have purple_door_1 unlocked or be in room_3. ✓
- Constraint 11: red_door_2 must be locked at some point. It starts locked, so that's fine. ✓
- Constraint 12: After red_door_2 is locked, I must either be holding green_ball_1 or have purple_door_1 unlocked. ✓
- Constraint 13: At some point, I must be holding some object and have purple_door_1 unlocked. ✓
- Constraint 14: I need to unlock red_door_2 at some point. I'll need to incorporate this.
- Constraint 15: Before unlocking red_door_2, I must be holding some object. ✓

Let's revise the plan to satisfy all constraints:

1. Pick up purple_ball_1 from room_4.
2. Go to red_door_2 to satisfy constraint 7.
3. Go to purple_door_1.
4. Unlock purple_door_1.
5. Go from room_4 to room_3. This satisfies part of constraint 10.
6. Drop purple_ball_1 (temporarily).
7. Unlock red_door_2 (to satisfy constraint 14. By then, I had been holding purple_ball_1, which satisfies constraint 15).
8. Pick up purple_ball_1 again.
9. Go to red_door_1.
10. Unlock red_door_1. This satisfies constraint 5.
11. Go from room_3 to room_1.
12. Drop purple_ball_1.
13. Go to grey_door_1. This satisfies constraint 9. By then, I had been in room_3 and purple_door_1 was unlocked, which satisfies constraint 10.
14. Pick up red_ball_1 (to satisfy part of constraint 8, since I was in front of red_door_2 earlier).
15. Unlock grey_door_1. By then, I had been holding objects, which satisfies constraint 3.
16. Drop red_ball_1.
17. Go in front of red_ball_2 (or red_ball_1, doesn't matter) to satisfy the goal.

However, there's still an issue: I don't go back to red_door_2 after picking it up to satisfy constraint 8. Let me revise the plan once more.

Ok, looking at this again, I realize that I don't need to physically go to red_door_2 to unlock it, since doors can be locked or unlocked remotely via the "toggle" action if I'm in front of them. I can toggle various doors without going through them. So let's revise the plan.

Also, I've been misunderstanding constraint 8. It says I need to hold red_ball_1 or purple_ball_1 after (not before) I'm in front of red_door_2.

So, let's revise the plan again.

From the constraints, I need to:
- Go to room_1.
- Never enter room_2.
- Pick up and hold an object (at least once).
- Be in front of purple_door_1, red_door_2, and grey_door_1.
- Unlock grey_door_1, red_door_1, and red_door_2.
- Ensure certain conditions are met before/after certain actions.

Given the room layout and the constraints, I'll try to design a plan:

1. Pick up purple_ball_1 from room_4.
2. Go to purple_door_1.
3. Unlock purple_door_1. This satisfies constraints 1 and part of 13.
4. Go from room_4 to room_3. This satisfies part of constraint 10.
5. Go to red_door_1.
6. Unlock red_door_1. This satisfies constraint 5.
7. Go to red_door_2. (Actually, red_door_2 connects room_2 and room_4. Since I'm in room_3, I can't directly go to red_door_2.)

Hmm, this is a bit tricky. Let me re-read the problem statement to make sure I'm understanding the room layout correctly.

...

Now I'm more clear. The rooms are arranged in a square formation with:
- room_1 (NW) connects to room_2 (SW) via grey_door_1.
- room_1 (NW) connects to room_3 (NE) via red_door_1.
- room_2 (SW) connects to room_4 (SE) via red_door_2.
- room_3 (NE) connects to room_4 (SE) via purple_door_1.

Starting in room_4 and needing to go to room_1 while never entering room_2, the only path is:
room_4 -> room_3 -> room_1.

Now, let's consider the constraints related to red_door_2. It connects room_2 and room_4, so I'd need to be in room_4 to see it. If I'm in room_4, I'd be on the room_4 side of the door, so I'd go to red_door_2 (not gotoroom) to be in front of it.

The constraint states that if I'm in front of red_door_2, then at that state or some state after, I must be holding red_ball_1 or purple_ball_1. So, I'd need to go to room_4, be in front of red_door_2, and then at some point, pick up red_ball_1 or purple_ball_1.

Similarly, for grey_door_1, it connects room_1 and room_2. Since I can't enter room_2, I'd need to be in room_1 to go to grey_door_1. To be in front of it.

With this clarity, let's revise the plan:

1. In room_4, pick up purple_ball_1.
2. Go to red_door_2 to satisfy constraint 7. After this action, I later need to hold red_ball_1 or purple_ball_1 to satisfy constraint 8. I'm already holding purple_ball_1, so that's fine.
3. Go to purple_door_1.
4. Unlock purple_door_1. This satisfies constraint 1 and part of 13.
5. Go from room_4 to room_3. This satisfies part of constraint 10.
6. Drop purple_ball_1 (temporarily).
7. Go to red_door_1.
8. Unlock red_door_1. This satisfies constraint 5.
9. Pick up purple_ball_1 again.
10. Go from room_3 to room_1.
11. Go to grey_door_1. This satisfies constraint 9. By then, I had been in room_3 and purple_door_1 was unlocked, which satisfies constraint 10.
12. Drop purple_ball_1 (temporarily).
13. Unlock grey_door_1. This satisfies constraint 2. By then, I had been holding purple_ball_1, which satisfies constraint 3.
14. Pick up red_ball_1 or red_ball_2.
15. Go in front of the other red ball to satisfy the goal.

Wait, there's a constraint that I need to unlock red_door_2 at some point. Since I can't be in room_2, I'd need to be in room_4 to see red_door_2. But I've already left room_4 in this plan. I need to revisit this.

I am a bit confused about how the toggle action works. The problem statement says for the toggle action: "you may only toggle a door d if you are in front of d." But the effects say it changes the lock status. It doesn't specify that I need to be on a specific side of the door. So, if I'm in front of a door, I can toggle its lock status, but I don't necessarily move through it.

With that understanding, let's revise the plan:

1. In room_4, pick up purple_ball_1.
2. Go to red_door_2 to satisfy constraint 7. After this action, I later need to hold red_ball_1 or purple_ball_1 to satisfy constraint 8. I'm already holding purple_ball_1, so that's fine.
3. Unlock red_door_2 (to satisfy constraint 14. I'm holding purple_ball_1, which satisfies constraint 15).
4. Lock red_door_2 again (to fully satisfy constraint 11. I'm holding purple_ball_1 and will later unlock purple_door_1, which satisfies constraint 12).
5. Go to purple_door_1.
6. Unlock purple_door_1. This satisfies constraint 1 and part of 13.
7. Go from room_4 to room_3. This satisfies part of constraint 10.
8. Go to red_door_1.
9. Unlock red_door_1. This satisfies constraint 5.
10. Go from room_3 to room_1.
11. Go to grey_door_1. This satisfies constraint 9. By then, I had been in room_3 and purple_door_1 was unlocked, which satisfies constraint 10.
12. Unlock grey_door_1. This satisfies constraint 2. By then, I had been holding purple_ball_1, which satisfies constraint 3.
13. Drop purple_ball_1.
14. Go in front of red_ball_1 or red_ball_2 to satisfy the goal.

This revised plan satisfies all the constraints:
- Constraint 1: I'll be in front of purple_door_1. ✓
- Constraint 2: I'll unlock grey_door_1. ✓
- Constraint 3: Before unlocking grey_door_1, I'll be holding purple_ball_1. ✓
- Constraint 4: I'll never be in room_2. ✓
- Constraint 5: I'll unlock red_door_1. ✓
- Constraint 6: I'll pick up and hold purple_ball_1. ✓
- Constraint 7: I'll be in front of red_door_2. ✓
- Constraint 8: I'm holding purple_ball_1 after being in front of red_door_2. ✓
- Constraint 9: I'll be in front of grey_door_1. ✓
- Constraint 10: Before being in front of grey_door_1, I'll have purple_door_1 unlocked and be in room_3. ✓
- Constraint 11: red_door_2 will be locked after I've unlocked it. ✓
- Constraint 12: After red_door_2 is locked, I'll have purple_door_1 unlocked. ✓
- Constraint 13: I'll be holding purple_ball_1 and have purple_door_1 unlocked. ✓
- Constraint 14: I'll unlock red_door_2. ✓
- Constraint 15: Before unlocking red_door_2, I'll be holding purple_ball_1. ✓

Let's trace through the plan step by step to ensure it works:

1. "pick purple_ball_1 room_4" - Pick up purple_ball_1 from room_4. Now I'm holding it.
2. "gotodoor red_door_2 room_4 room_2" - Go in front of red_door_2 in room_4. This satisfies constraint 7.
3. "toggle red_door_2" - Unlock red_door_2. This satisfies constraint 14.
4. "toggle red_door_2" - Lock red_door_2 again. This satisfies constraint 11.
5. "gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_3" - Go in front of purple_door_1 in room_4. This satisfies constraint 1.
6. "toggle purple_door_1" - Unlock purple_door_1. This, along with the fact I'm holding purple_ball_1, satisfies constraint 13.
7. "gotoroom room_4 room_3 purple_door_1" - Go from room_4 to room_3. This satisfies part of constraint 10.
8. "gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1" - Go in front of red_door_1 in room_3.
9. "toggle red_door_1" - Unlock red_door_1. This satisfies constraint 5.
10. "gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1" - Go from room_3 to room_1.
11. "gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2" - Go in front of grey_door_1 in room_1. This satisfies constraint 9.
12. "toggle grey_door_1" - Unlock grey_door_1. This satisfies constraint 2.
13. "drop purple_ball_1 room_1" - Drop purple_ball_1 in room_1.
14. "gotoobject red_ball_1 room_1" - Go in front of red_ball_1 in room_1 to satisfy the goal.

This seems like a correct plan that satisfies all constraints.

Wait, there's an issue. In step 13, when I drop purple_ball_1, I need to be in front of an empty position. I need to go to an empty position before dropping.

Also I realize that the action string is not exactly what I described. Let me read the problem statement again for the exact format.

...

The action strings should be:
- "gotoobject x r" - Go in front of object x in room r.
- "gotoempty" - Go in front of an empty position.
- "gotodoor d r1 r2" - Go in front of door d connecting room r1 to room r2.
- "gotoroom r1 r2 d" - Go to room r2 from room r1 using door d.
- "pick x r" - Pick up object x in room r.
- "drop x r" - Drop object x in room r.
- "toggle d" - Unlock/Lock door d.

With this, let's correct the plan:

1. "pick purple_ball_1 room_4" - Pick up purple_ball_1 from room_4.
2. "gotodoor red_door_2 room_4 room_2" - Go in front of red_door_2.
3. "toggle red_door_2" - Unlock red_door_2.
4. "toggle red_door_2" - Lock red_door_2 again.
5. "gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_3" - Go in front of purple_door_1.
6. "toggle purple_door_1" - Unlock purple_door_1.
7. "gotoroom room_4 room_3 purple_door_1" - Go to room_3.
8. "gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1" - Go in front of red_door_1.
9. "toggle red_door_1" - Unlock red_door_1.
10. "gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1" - Go to room_1.
11. "gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2" - Go in front of grey_door_1.
12. "toggle grey_door_1" - Unlock grey_door_1.
13. "gotoempty" - Go in front of an empty position.
14. "drop purple_ball_1 room_1" - Drop purple_ball_1.
15. "gotoobject red_ball_1 room_1" - Go in front of red_ball_1. Or "gotoobject red_ball_2 room_1" if I want to go to the other red ball.

Actually, let me think again. The goal is to be in front of a red ball in room_1. If I drop purple_ball_1 in front of an empty position, I'm in front of purple_ball_1 (not an empty position). Then if I go to red_ball_1, I'm satisfying the goal.

Let's check this plan again against the constraints:
- Constraint 1: I'll be in front of purple_door_1 (step 5). ✓
- Constraint 2: I'll unlock grey_door_1 (step 12). ✓
- Constraint 3: Before unlocking grey_door_1, I'll be holding purple_ball_1. ✓
- Constraint 4: I'll never be in room_2. ✓
- Constraint 5: I'll unlock red_door_1 (step 9). ✓
- Constraint 6: I'll pick up and hold purple_ball_1 (step 1). ✓
- Constraint 7: I'll be in front of red_door_2 (step 2). ✓
- Constraint 8: I'm holding purple_ball_1 after being in front of red_door_2. ✓
- Constraint 9: I'll be in front of grey_door_1 (step 11). ✓
- Constraint 10: Before being in front of grey_door_1, I'll have purple_door_1 unlocked and be in room_3. ✓
- Constraint 11: red_door_2 will be locked after I've unlocked it (step 4). ✓
- Constraint 12: After red_door_2 is locked, I'll have purple_door_1 unlocked. ✓
- Constraint 13: I'll be holding purple_ball_1 and have purple_door_1 unlocked simultaneously. ✓
- Constraint 14: I'll unlock red_door_2 (step 3). ✓
- Constraint 15: Before unlocking red_door_2, I'll be holding purple_ball_1. ✓

The plan seems to satisfy all constraints, and it's optimal in terms of the number of steps.

Actually, there's one thing I just realized. After dropping the purple_ball_1, I'm in front of it, not at an empty position. So, when I want to go in front of red_ball_1, I might not be able to use "gotoobject" directly because I'm not at an empty position. 

Let me think about the preconditions and effects again. The "gotoobject" action requires that I be in the same room as the object, but it doesn't specify that I must be at an empty position. So, I think I can go from being in front of purple_ball_1 to being in front of red_ball_1 directly.

Final plan:
1. "pick purple_ball_1 room_4" - Pick up purple_ball_1 from room_4.
2. "gotodoor red_door_2 room_4 room_2" - Go in front of red_door_2.
3. "toggle red_door_2" - Unlock red_door_2.
4. "toggle red_door_2" - Lock red_door_2 again.
5. "gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_3" - Go in front of purple_door_1.
6. "toggle purple_door_1" - Unlock purple_door_1.
7. "gotoroom room_4 room_3 purple_door_1" - Go to room_3.
8. "gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1" - Go in front of red_door_1.
9. "toggle red_door_1" - Unlock red_door_1.
10. "gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1" - Go to room_1.
11. "gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2" - Go in front of grey_door_1.
12. "toggle grey_door_1" - Unlock grey_door_1.
13. "gotoempty" - Go in front of an empty position.
14. "drop purple_ball_1 room_1" - Drop purple_ball_1.
15. "gotoobject red_ball_1 room_1" - Go in front of red_ball_1. (Or "gotoobject red_ball_2 room_1" if I want to go to the other red ball.)

I think this plan is correct. Let me double check the actions.

Action: "pick x r". Preconditions: (1) You are in the same room as x. (2) You are not holding any object. Effects: (1) You are no longer in front of x. (2) Your hands are no longer empty. (3) You are carrying x. (4) x is no longer in the room. (5) If x was blocking some door, then it is no longer blocking that door.

Action: "gotodoor d r1 r2". Preconditions: (1) You are in a room which door d is connecting with another room. (2) There is no object blocking the position in front of d in the room you are currently in. Effects: (1) If you were in front of some object or door x0, then you are no longer in front of x0. (2) You are in front of door d.

Action: "toggle d". Preconditions: You are in front of d. Effects: (1) If d was locked, then it becomes unlocked. (2) If d was unlocked, then it becomes locked.

Action: "gotodoor d r1 r2". (Already described)

Action: "toggle d". (Already described)

Action: "gotoroom r1 r2 d". Preconditions: (1) You are currently in a room r0 that is adjacent to r. (2) The door that is connecting r0 and r is unlocked. Effects: (1) You are no longer in r1. (2) You are in r2. (3) You have visited r2. (4) If you were in front of some object or door x0, then you are no longer in front of x0.

Action: "gotodoor d r1 r2". (Already described)

Action: "toggle d". (Already described)

Action: "gotoroom r1 r2 d". (Already described)

Action: "gotodoor d r1 r2". (Already described)

Action: "toggle d". (Already described)

Action: "gotoempty". Preconditions: None (you may go in front of an empty position anytime). Effects: (1) If you were in front of some object or door x0, then you are no longer in front of x0. (2) You are in front of an empty position.

Action: "drop x r". Preconditions: (1) You are currently holding x. (2) The position in front of you is empty. Effects: (1) You are no longer carrying x. (2) You are in front of x. (3) Your hands are empty. (4) Object x is situated in the room you are currently in.

Action: "gotoobject x r". Preconditions: You may only go in front of an object x if you are in the same room as x. Effects: (1) If you were in front of some object or door x0, then you are no longer in front of x0. (2) You are in front of object x.

All actions in the plan are valid with their preconditions met.

Let me review the plan one last time to ensure it meets all constraints:
1. "pick purple_ball_1 room_4" - I pick up purple_ball_1 from room_4.
2. "gotodoor red_door_2 room_4 room_2" - I go in front of red_door_2 while in room_4. This satisfies constraint 7.
3. "toggle red_door_2" - I unlock red_door_2. This satisfies constraint 14. Before this, I'm holding purple_ball_1, which satisfies constraint 15.
4. "toggle red_door_2" - I lock red_door_2 again. This satisfies constraint 11. After this, I'll unlock purple_door_1, which satisfies constraint 12.
5. "gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_3" - I go in front of purple_door_1 while in room_4. This satisfies constraint 1.
6. "toggle purple_door_1" - I unlock purple_door_1. This, along with the fact I'm holding purple_ball_1, satisfies constraint 13.
7. "gotoroom room_4 room_3 purple_door_1" - I go from room_4 to room_3. This satisfies part of constraint 10.
8. "gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1" - I go in front of red_door_1 while in room_3.
9. "toggle red_door_1" - I unlock red_door_1. This satisfies constraint 5.
10. "gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1" - I go from room_3 to room_1.
11. "gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2" - I go in front of grey_door_1 while in room_1. This satisfies constraint 9. Before this, I've been in room_3 and purple_door_1 is unlocked, which satisfies constraint 10.
12. "toggle grey_door_1" - I unlock grey_door_1. This satisfies constraint 2. Before this, I'm holding purple_ball_1, which satisfies constraint 3.
13. "gotoempty" - I go in front of an empty position in room_1.
14. "drop purple_ball_1 room_1" - I drop purple_ball_1 in room_1.
15. "gotoobject red_ball_1 room_1" - I go in front of red_ball_1 in room_1 to satisfy the goal. (Or "gotoobject red_ball_2 room_1" if I want to go to the other red ball.)

The plan satisfies all constraints and achieves the goal. It's also optimal in terms of the number of steps.

```
pick purple_ball_1 room_4
gotodoor red_door_2 room_4 room_2
toggle red_door_2
toggle red_door_2
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_3
toggle purple_door_1
gotoroom room_4 room_3 purple_door_1
gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1
toggle red_door_1
gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2
toggle grey_door_1
gotoempty
drop purple_ball_1 room_1
gotoobject red_ball_1 room_1
```

Hmm, I have a last thought. I drop purple_ball_1 in room_1, and I end up in front of it. And then I go in front of red_ball_1, which satisfies the goal. But what if being in front of purple_ball_1 prevents me from going in front of red_ball_1 directly? Let's check the precondition for "gotoobject".

Action: "gotoobject x r". Preconditions: You may only go in front of an object x if you are in the same room as x. 

It doesn't say I can't be in front of another object. But it does say that after the action, I'm no longer in front of any previous object. So, it should be fine.

Let's double-check the effects:

Effects for "gotoobject": (1) If you were in front of some object or door x0, then you are no longer in front of x0. (2) You are in front of object x.

Yes, I can be in front of purple_ball_1 and then go directly to being in front of red_ball_1 using "gotoobject red_ball_1 room_1".

Final Plan:
```
pick purple_ball_1 room_4
gotodoor red_door_2 room_4 room_2
toggle red_door_2
toggle red_door_2
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_3
toggle purple_door_1
gotoroom room_4 room_3 purple_door_1
gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1
