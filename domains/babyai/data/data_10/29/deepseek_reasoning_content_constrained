Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. The goal is to get a red ball into room_1, be in room_1, and be in front of that red ball. But there are a bunch of constraints to satisfy. Let me first list out all the constraints and the initial state to make sure I don't miss anything.

Starting in room_4. The red balls are in room_1, but I need to end up in room_1 in front of one of them. Wait, the goal is that there exists a red ball in room_1 (which they already are) and I'm in room_1 in front of it. So maybe I just need to get to room_1 and go to one of the red balls. But there are locked doors everywhere. Let's check the doors:

Doors:
- grey_door_1 connects room_1 and room_2. It's locked initially.
- red_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3. Locked.
- red_door_2 connects room_2 and room_4. Locked.
- purple_door_1 connects room_3 and room_4. Locked.

Constraints:
1. Must be in front of purple_door_1 at least once.
2. grey_door_1 must be unlocked at some point.
3. If grey_door_1 is unlocked, must have held an object before.
4. Never be in room_2.
5. red_door_1 must be unlocked at some point.
6. Must hold an object at some point.
7. Must be in front of red_door_2 at least once.
8. If in front of red_door_2, then either holding red_ball_1 or purple_ball_1 during or after that state.
9. Must be in front of grey_door_1 at some point.
10. If in front of grey_door_1, then either purple_door_1 is unlocked or in room_3 before.
11. red_door_2 must be locked at some state.
12. If red_door_2 is locked, then either hold green_ball_1 or purple_door_1 is unlocked during or after.
13. Must have a state where holding an object and purple_door_1 is unlocked.
14. red_door_2 must be unlocked at some point.
15. If red_door_2 is unlocked, must have held an object before.

So, the constraints are quite intertwined. Let's think step by step.

First, since we start in room_4, and need to get to room_1. The doors from room_4 are red_door_2 (connects to room_2) and purple_door_1 (connects to room_3). But we can't go into room_2 (constraint 4), so we must go through purple_door_1 to room_3. But purple_door_1 is locked, so we need to unlock it. To toggle a door, we need to be in front of it. So first, go to purple_door_1 in room_4, toggle it. But before that, maybe we need to pick up an object, since some constraints require holding objects. For example, constraint 6 requires holding an object at least once. Also, constraint 13 requires a state where holding an object and purple_door_1 is unlocked. So if we unlock purple_door_1 while holding something, that might satisfy that.

But in room_4, there's purple_ball_1. So possible steps:

1. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4
2. pick purple_ball_1 room_4
3. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_3 (but need to check if there's any object blocking the door. The initial state says "grey_box_2 is in room_3", but not in room_4. So maybe in room_4, the position in front of the door isn't blocked. So go to the door.
4. toggle purple_door_1 (unlocks it). Now purple_door_1 is unlocked. But we are holding purple_ball_1, so this satisfies constraint 13 (holding object and door unlocked). Then, we can go to room_3 via purple_door_1.

But from room_3, we need to get to room_1. The door from room_3 to room_1 is red_door_1, which is locked. So need to unlock that. To unlock red_door_1, need to be in front of it. So in room_3, go to red_door_1 (gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1), then toggle it. But to toggle, need to be in front of it. However, before that, the preconditions: when going to a door, there must be no object blocking the position in front of the door in the current room. In room_3, the objects are blue_ball_1, red_box_1, grey_box_2. Are any of these blocking the door? The initial state doesn't mention objects blocking doors, unless the presence of an object in the room implies blocking. Wait, the preconditions for "gotodoor" include (ii) there is no object blocking the position in front of d in the room you are currently in. But the problem statement doesn't mention any initial blockages. So maybe by default, doors are not blocked unless an object is in front. So if there's an object in front of the door, which would be in the same room as the door. For example, if in room_3, the red_door_1 connects to room_1. The position in front of red_door_1 in room_3 might be blocked by an object. Are there any objects in room_3 near the door? The initial state lists blue_ball_1, red_box_1, grey_box_2 in room_3, but their positions aren't specified. Since the problem doesn't state any doors are blocked, we can assume that the doors are not blocked, so we can go to them.

So steps in room_3:

5. After entering room_3 via purple_door_1, gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1
6. toggle red_door_1 (unlocking it). Now red_door_1 is unlocked (satisfies constraint 5). Then, go through red_door_1 to room_1. But wait, the agent is in room_3, wants to go to room_1 via red_door_1. So gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1. But to do that, need to be in front of red_door_1. So step 5 is gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1, then step 6 is toggle, then step 7 is gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1. Once in room_1, we need to go to a red ball (red_ball_1 or red_ball_2) and be in front of it.

But there's a problem: the agent is holding purple_ball_1. To drop it? But the goal is to be in front of a red ball in room_1. So perhaps after arriving in room_1, drop the purple_ball_1, then gotoobject red_ball_1. But maybe not necessary. Alternatively, maybe the agent can just drop the purple_ball_1 in room_1, but the goal doesn't require that. But constraints:

Constraint 8: If in front of red_door_2 (which connects room_2 and room_4), then at that state or after, must hold red_ball_1 or purple_ball_1. But since we're not supposed to go into room_2 (constraint 4), how do we get in front of red_door_2? Wait, red_door_2 is in room_4 (connecting to room_2) and room_2 (connecting to room_4). But we can't enter room_2. So the only way to be in front of red_door_2 is in room_4. Because in room_4, the door connects to room_2, but the agent can be in front of red_door_2 in room_4 without entering room_2. So perhaps after dropping the purple_ball_1, the agent needs to go back to room_4, go to red_door_2 in room_4, which would satisfy being in front of it, and then must hold either red_ball_1 or purple_ball_1 at that state or after. But if the agent has already dropped purple_ball_1 in room_1, then maybe need to pick it up again.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let's try to outline the steps considering all constraints.

Starting in room_4. Need to satisfy:

- Must be in front of purple_door_1 (room_4 to room_3). So first action could be gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_3, but to do that, need to be in room_4. But before that, if there's an object blocking, but initial state doesn't mention that, so possible.

Wait, but to toggle a door, you need to be in front of it. So first, maybe:

1. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_3 (now in front of purple_door_1)
   - This satisfies constraint 1 (in front of purple_door_1)
   - Now, need to unlock it. But it's locked. So toggle it. But to toggle, need to be in front of it. So action 2: toggle purple_door_1. Now it's unlocked.

But constraint 13 requires a state where holding an object and purple_door_1 is unlocked. So if we do this before picking up anything, then when we toggle purple_door_1, we are not holding anything. So that won't satisfy constraint 13. Therefore, maybe we need to pick up an object first, then go to purple_door_1, unlock it while holding the object.

So:

1. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4
2. pick purple_ball_1 room_4 (now holding it, which satisfies constraint 6 and 13 if we unlock purple_door_1 while holding)
3. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_3
4. toggle purple_door_1 (now unlocked, and we're holding the ball. So this satisfies constraint 13)
5. gotoroom room_4 room_3 purple_door_1 (now in room_3)
6. Now need to unlock red_door_1 (connects room_1 and room_3). It's locked. So:
7. gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1
8. toggle red_door_1 (now unlocked, satisfying constraint 5)
9. gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1 (now in room_1)
10. Now in room_1. Need to be in front of a red ball. The red_ball_1 and red_ball_2 are here. So:
11. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_1 (now in front of it)
12. Now, check if all constraints are met.

But wait, other constraints need to be satisfied:

- Must be in front of grey_door_1 (connects room_1 and room_2). But room_2 is forbidden (constraint 4). So how to get in front of grey_door_1? Since grey_door_1 is in room_1 (and room_2), the agent can be in room_1 and go to grey_door_1 there. So:

After step 9, the agent is in room_1. Then:

10. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2 (this is allowed because the agent is in room_1, and the door connects room_1 and room_2. But need to check if there's an object blocking the door in room_1. The initial state in room_1 has red_ball_1 and red_ball_2. If their positions don't block the door, then possible.

So step 10: gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2 (satisfies constraint 9). Now, constraint 10 says that if in front of grey_door_1, then either purple_door_1 was unlocked before or the agent was in room_3 before. Since we were in room_3 earlier (step 5), this is satisfied. So that's okay.

Then, need to unlock grey_door_1 (constraint 2). But to unlock it, we need to toggle it. But since we are holding purple_ball_1, can we toggle while holding? Yes, the toggle action only requires being in front of the door. So step 11: toggle grey_door_1 (unlocking it, satisfying constraint 2). But constraint 3 says that if grey_door_1 is unlocked, then must have held an object before. Since we picked up purple_ball_1 in step 2, this is satisfied.

Now, after unlocking grey_door_1, we can proceed. But we can't enter room_2. So no need to go there. But now, other constraints:

- Must be in front of red_door_2 (connects room_4 and room_2). So how? The agent is in room_1, needs to get to room_4. To get back, maybe via room_3. So after step 11, maybe:

12. drop purple_ball_1 room_1 (to free hands, but not sure if needed)
13. But then, to go back to room_3 via red_door_1 (already unlocked). So gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1.
14. Then, go to purple_door_1 in room_3, go back to room_4.
But maybe a better path. Alternatively, the agent is in room_1, needs to get to room_4. Let's think.

Wait, after step 9, the agent is in room_1. Then steps 10 and 11 are in room_1. Then, the agent needs to get to red_door_2, which is in room_4 and room_2. But can't go to room_2, so must go to red_door_2 from room_4. So the agent needs to go back to room_4.

So after step 11, the agent is in room_1, holding purple_ball_1, in front of grey_door_1. Let's see:

12. gotoempty (to leave the front of grey_door_1)
13. gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1 (since red_door_1 is unlocked)
14. Then, gotoroom room_3 room_4 purple_door_1 (since it's unlocked)
15. Now back in room_4. Then, need to go to red_door_2 (connects to room_2) in room_4.

16. gotodoor red_door_2 room_4 room_2 (satisfies constraint 7)
But constraint 8: when in front of red_door_2, must hold red_ball_1 or purple_ball_1 during or after. The agent is currently holding purple_ball_1 (if they didn't drop it). Wait, after step 11, the agent is holding purple_ball_1. So if they go back to room_4 and then go to red_door_2, they are still holding it. So step 16: gotodoor red_door_2 room_4 room_2. Now in front of red_door_2, and holding purple_ball_1. This satisfies constraint 8.

Also, constraint 14 requires red_door_2 to be unlocked at some point. But initially, red_door_2 is locked. So we need to unlock it? Or maybe lock it again. Wait, constraint 11 says red_door_2 must be locked at some state. So need to toggle it. But when? Let's think.

After being in front of red_door_2 (step 16), the agent can toggle it. But currently, it's locked. So toggling would unlock it. Then, maybe toggle it again to lock it. But this might complicate the steps.

Alternatively, perhaps after unlocking red_door_2, then lock it again. Let's see.

17. toggle red_door_2 (unlocks it, satisfying constraint 14). Then, constraint 15 says if it's unlocked, must have held an object before. Which we did (step 2).

But then, constraint 11 requires red_door_2 to be locked at some state. So after unlocking it (step 17), we need to lock it again. So:

18. toggle red_door_2 (now locked again, satisfying constraint 11). Then, constraint 12 says if red_door_2 is locked in some state s, then either holding green_ball_1 or purple_door_1 is unlocked during or after. Purple_door_1 is already unlocked (step 4), so that's satisfied.

So step 18 would satisfy constraint 11. Also, step 17 satisfies constraint 14 (unlocked), and step 18 satisfies constraint 11 (locked). But this adds steps. However, the plan needs to be optimal, so maybe there's a way to do it in fewer steps.

Alternatively, maybe we can lock red_door_2 without unlocking it. But initially, it's locked. So to lock it again, we need to unlock it first. Wait, the toggle action toggles the state. So if it's locked, toggle makes it unlocked. Then toggle again to lock it. So to have a state where it's locked, we can do that. But maybe there's a way to have it locked again. But the initial state is locked, so if we never unlock it, then it remains locked. But constraint 14 requires it to be unlocked at some point. So we have to unlock it once, then maybe lock it again.

But this might complicate the plan. Let's try to structure the steps:

From room_4, after returning via room_3:

16. gotodoor red_door_2 room_4 room_2
17. toggle red_door_2 (now unlocked) → satisfies constraint 14
18. toggle red_door_2 again (now locked) → satisfies constraint 11
But now, when we lock it (step 18), constraint 12 requires that during or after this state, either holding green_ball_1 or purple_door_1 is unlocked. Purple_door_1 is already unlocked, so that's okay. So step 18 is allowed.

But during step 17, we have red_door_2 unlocked, which requires that before that, the agent held an object (constraint 15). Since step 2 was holding purple_ball_1, which is before, that's satisfied.

So steps 16-18 would handle constraints 7,8,11,12,14,15.

Then, after that, the agent needs to get back to room_1 to achieve the goal. So:

19. drop purple_ball_1 room_4 (if needed, but maybe not necessary)
Wait, but the agent needs to be in room_1 in front of a red ball. So after step 18, the agent is in front of red_door_2 in room_4. Then, need to go back to room_1. The path would be room_4 → room_3 via purple_door_1, then room_3 → room_1 via red_door_1. But the agent is holding purple_ball_1. To enter room_1, need to drop it somewhere or keep holding.

But the goal requires being in room_1 in front of a red ball. So after getting back to room_1:

19. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_1 (assuming the agent is in room_1 and not holding anything. Wait, but the agent is holding purple_ball_1. So need to drop it first.

So steps:

19. gotoroom room_4 room_3 purple_door_1 (from room_4 to room_3)
20. gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1
21. drop purple_ball_1 room_1 (since we need to be in front of red_ball_1, and can't be holding anything to pick it up. Wait, no, the goal just requires being in front of it, not necessarily picking it up. So maybe after step 20, the agent is in room_1, still holding purple_ball_1. Then:

21. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_1 (precondition: in same room as object. Since in room_1, possible. Then, this action puts the agent in front of red_ball_1. The goal is achieved.

But wait, the drop is needed only if the agent needs to perform other actions. Since the goal is to be in front of a red ball in room_1, holding it is not necessary. So steps 1-11, then 12-18, then back to room_1, then gotoobject.

But let's check the path again:

Original steps:

1. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4
2. pick purple_ball_1 room_4
3. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_3
4. toggle purple_door_1 (unlocked)
5. gotoroom room_4 room_3 purple_door_1 (now in room_3)
6. gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1
7. toggle red_door_1 (unlocked)
8. gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1 (now in room_1)
9. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2
10. toggle grey_door_1 (unlocked)
11. gotoempty (to leave door)
12. gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1
13. gotoroom room_3 room_4 purple_door_1 (back to room_4)
14. gotodoor red_door_2 room_4 room_2
15. toggle red_door_2 (unlocked)
16. toggle red_door_2 (locked again)
17. gotoroom room_4 room_3 purple_door_1
18. gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1 (back to room_1)
19. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_1

This sequence seems long. Let's check constraints:

- Constraint 1: in front of purple_door_1 (step 3)
- Constraint 2: grey_door_1 unlocked (step 10)
- Constraint 3: before step 10, agent held object (step 2)
- Constraint 4: never in room_2 (all steps avoid room_2)
- Constraint 5: red_door_1 unlocked (step7)
- Constraint 6: held object (step2)
- Constraint7: in front of red_door_2 (step14)
- Constraint8: when in front of red_door_2 (step14), holding purple_ball_1 (yes)
- Constraint9: in front of grey_door_1 (step9)
- Constraint10: before step9, was in room_3 (steps5-8)
- Constraint11: red_door_2 locked (step16)
- Constraint12: when red_door_2 is locked (step16), purple_door_1 is unlocked (step4), so satisfies
- Constraint13: must have a state where holding object and purple_door_1 unlocked. Step4: holding purple_ball_1 and purple_door_1 is unlocked after toggle. But step4 is the toggle action. So after step4, the door is unlocked, and the agent is still holding the ball. So that state satisfies constraint13.
- Constraint14: red_door_2 unlocked (step15)
- Constraint15: before step15, held object (step2)

So all constraints seem satisfied. The steps include going back and forth between rooms, which might be necessary. But the problem requires an optimal plan, i.e., minimal steps. Let's count the steps in the above sequence:

Steps 1-19: 19 actions. Can we optimize?

Let me see. Maybe after step8 (in room_1), instead of going to grey_door_1, then back to room_4, perhaps there's a shorter path. But the constraints require being in front of grey_door_1 and red_door_2.

Alternatively, after step8, the agent is in room_1. They need to go to grey_door_1 (step9), unlock it (step10). Then, to get to red_door_2, they have to go back to room_4. So steps 11-13.

But perhaps there's a way to avoid some steps. For example, after step10, instead of going back to room_4, maybe use another path. But how?

Alternatively, after unlocking grey_door_1, the agent can stay in room_1 and then proceed to the goal. But they still need to satisfy being in front of red_door_2 and other constraints.

Alternatively, maybe after unlocking grey_door_1 and being in room_1, the agent can drop the ball, go to room_4, pick up another ball, etc. But time is limited; perhaps the current plan is acceptable.

But wait, the final goal is to be in room_1 in front of a red ball. After step8, the agent is in room_1. So why not just gotoobject red_ball_1 room_1 right away, then done? But then other constraints wouldn't be met, like being in front of grey_door_1, red_door_2, etc.

So the plan must include all those steps to satisfy constraints.

But perhaps there's a smarter way. Let me try to outline again:

Alternative plan:

1. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room4, pick it up.
2. gotodoor purple_door_1, toggle (unlock) → meets constraint1 and13.
3. go to room3.
4. gotodoor red_door_1, toggle (unlock) → constraint5.
5. go to room1.
6. gotodoor grey_door_1 → constraint9.
7. toggle (unlock grey_door_1) → constraint2. Also, since we're holding purple_ball_1, constraint3 is met.
8. go back to room3, then room4.
9. gotodoor red_door_2 → constraint7. Holding purple_ball_1 meets constraint8.
10. toggle red_door_2 (unlock → constraint14)
11. toggle again (lock → constraint11)
12. go back to room1.
13. gotoobject red_ball_1 → goal.

This way, the steps are fewer. Let's count:

1. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room4
2. pick purple_ball_1
3. gotodoor purple_door_1 room4 room3
4. toggle → unlock
5. gotoroom room4 room3
6. gotodoor red_door_1 room3 room1
7. toggle → unlock
8. gotoroom room3 room1
9. gotodoor grey_door_1 room1 room2
10. toggle → unlock
11. gotoempty (optional?)
12. gotoroom room1 room3
13. gotoroom room3 room4
14. gotodoor red_door_2 room4 room2
15. toggle → unlock (constraint14)
16. toggle → lock (constraint11)
17. gotoroom room4 room3
18. gotoroom room3 room1
19. gotoobject red_ball_1

Still around 19 steps. Maybe there's a way to avoid some back-and-forth.

Wait, after step5 (in room3), step6 is gotodoor red_door_1, then toggle, then goto room1. Then in room1, go to grey_door_1, toggle, then need to get to red_door_2. But to get to red_door_2, must go back to room4.

Alternatively, after step10 (unlock grey_door_1), the agent is in room1. Then, they can go directly to room2? But constraint4 forbids being in room2. So no.

So the agent has to go back through room3 to room4. This seems unavoidable.

Another approach: perhaps combine some steps. For example, after unlocking purple_door_1 and red_door_1, the agent can go to room1, unlock grey_door_1, then return to room4 via room3, then handle red_door_2.

But this still requires multiple trips.

Alternatively, after unlocking grey_door_1, the agent can drop the purple_ball_1 in room1, then go to room3 and room4, pick up another object, but the other objects in room4 is only purple_ball_1, which was dropped. Wait, no, initial objects in room4: purple_ball_1. If the agent drops it in room1, then room4 has no objects. So can't pick anything there. But perhaps in room3, there's blue_ball_1, red_box_1, grey_box_2. But the agent can't pick boxes (actions are for balls and boxes, but the actions "pick x r" apply to both? The problem says objects can be boxes or balls. The preconditions for pick are: same room as x, not holding anything. So yes, can pick boxes. But boxes might be useful for blocking, but in this problem, the constraints don't require moving boxes. But maybe picking a box would help in some constraints. However, the constraint8 requires holding red_ball_1 or purple_ball_1 when in front of red_door_2. So if the agent picks a box, that won't help. So must hold purple_ball_1 or red_ball_1.

But the red_ball_1 is in room1. So after the agent is in room1, they could pick it up. But the goal requires being in front of it, not necessarily holding it. So maybe after dropping purple_ball_1 in room1, pick up red_ball_1, then go to red_door_2. But that might add steps.

Alternatively, after step8 (in room1), the agent is holding purple_ball_1. They can drop it, then pick up red_ball_1. Then go back to room4, go to red_door_2, which would satisfy constraint8 (holding red_ball_1). But this adds steps. Let's see:

After step8 in room1:

9. drop purple_ball_1 room1
10. pick red_ball_1 room1
11. gotodoor grey_door_1 room1 room2
12. toggle (unlock)
13. gotoroom room1 room3
14. gotoroom room3 room4
15. gotodoor red_door_2 room4 room2
16. toggle (unlock)
17. toggle (lock)
18. gotoempty
19. gotoroom room4 room3
20. gotoroom room3 room1
21. gotoobject red_ball_1

This adds steps for picking and dropping. But now, when in front of red_door_2 (step15), holding red_ball_1, which satisfies constraint8. Also, constraint13 is already satisfied when holding purple_ball_1 and unlocking purple_door_1. But this approach requires more steps.

Given the requirement for an optimal plan, perhaps the first approach is better.

But let's see if we can find a shorter path.

Wait, the agent starts in room4. They need to get to room1. The shortest path would be room4 → room3 via purple_door_1 (unlock), then room3 → room1 via red_door_1 (unlock). But along the way, satisfy all constraints.

But the constraints require visiting other doors. For example, being in front of grey_door_1 and red_door_2.

So steps:

1. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room4 → pick it up (satisfies constraint6)
2. gotodoor purple_door_1 room4 room3 → toggle (unlock, satisfies constraint1 and13)
3. gotoroom room4 room3
4. gotodoor red_door_1 room3 room1 → toggle (unlock, satisfies constraint5)
5. gotoroom room3 room1
6. gotodoor grey_door_1 room1 room2 → toggle (unlock, satisfies constraint2 and9)
7. gotoroom room1 room3
8. gotoroom room3 room4
9. gotodoor red_door_2 room4 room2 → (satisfies constraint7)
   - At this step, holding purple_ball_1 → satisfies constraint8
10. toggle red_door_2 (unlock, satisfies constraint14)
11. toggle red_door_2 (lock, satisfies constraint11)
12. gotoroom room4 room3
13. gotoroom room3 room1
14. gotoobject red_ball_1 room1

This is 14 steps. Let's count:

1. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room4
2. pick purple_ball_1 room4
3. gotodoor purple_door_1 room4 room3
4. toggle purple_door_1
5. gotoroom room4 room3
6. gotodoor red_door_1 room3 room1
7. toggle red_door_1
8. gotoroom room3 room1
9. gotodoor grey_door_1 room1 room2
10. toggle grey_door_1
11. gotoroom room1 room3
12. gotoroom room3 room4
13. gotodoor red_door_2 room4 room2
14. toggle red_door_2
15. toggle red_door_2
16. gotoroom room4 room3
17. gotoroom room3 room1
18. gotoobject red_ball_1 room1

Wait, that's 18 steps. Hmm. Maybe combining steps.

Alternatively, after step10 (toggle grey_door_1), the agent is in room1. Then steps to get to red_door_2:

11. gotoroom room1 room3 via red_door_1
12. gotoroom room3 room4 via purple_door_1
13. gotodoor red_door_2 room4 room2
14. toggle (unlock)
15. toggle (lock)
16. gotoroom room4 room3
17. gotoroom room3 room1
18. gotoobject red_ball_1

This is 18 steps. But perhaps there's a way to reduce.

Wait, after step8 (in room1), steps 9-10 (goto grey_door_1 and unlock). Then, steps11-12 to return to room4. Then steps13-15 to handle red_door_2. Then back to room1. It's a lot of moving, but necessary due to constraints.

Alternatively, is there a way to toggle red_door_2 without going back? For example, after step10, agent is in room1, but needs to get to room4. So the path is room1 → room3 → room4. Then, handle red_door_2. Then go back to room1.

This seems necessary.

So the minimal steps would be around 18. But perhaps there's a way to optimize.

Wait, after step5 (gotoroom room4 room3), can we proceed to room3's red_door_1, unlock it, go to room1, then handle grey_door_1, then return to room3, then room4, handle red_door_2, then back to room1. This seems unavoidable.

Alternatively, perhaps after step14 (unlock red_door_2), the agent can immediately lock it (step15) and then proceed to room1. But that would require going back through room3 again.

Alternatively, perhaps the agent doesn't need to return to room1 after step18. Because after step18, they are in room1, in front of red_ball_1. So the final step is achieved.

But the question is, is there a way to avoid some of the steps?

Let me think again. After unlocking grey_door_1 (step10), the agent is in room1. They need to get to room4 to reach red_door_2. So:

11. gotoroom room1 room3 (via red_door_1)
12. gotoroom room3 room4 (via purple_door_1)
13. gotodoor red_door_2 room4 room2
14. toggle (unlock)
15. toggle (lock)
16. gotoroom room4 room3
17. gotoroom room3 room1
18. gotoobject red_ball_1

So steps 1-18. But maybe steps 11-17 can be optimized.

Wait, when in room4 after step12, the agent is in room4. Then step13: gotodoor red_door_2. Then steps14-15: toggle twice. Then step16-17: go back to room1.

But perhaps after step15 (lock red_door_2), the agent can directly go to room1 via room3. So steps16-17 are needed.

Alternatively, is there a way to avoid going back to room1 twice? Like, after step17 (in room1), then gotoobject.

Yes, that's what happens. So steps1-18:

1. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room4
2. pick purple_ball_1
3. gotodoor purple_door_1 room4 room3
4. toggle purple_door_1
5. gotoroom room4 room3
6. gotodoor red_door_1 room3 room1
7. toggle red_door_1
8. gotoroom room3 room1
9. gotodoor grey_door_1 room1 room2
10. toggle grey_door_1
11. gotoroom room1 room3
12. gotoroom room3 room4
13. gotodoor red_door_2 room4 room2
14. toggle red_door_2
15. toggle red_door_2
16. gotoroom room4 room3
17. gotoroom room3 room1
18. gotoobject red_ball_1 room1

This is 18 actions. Let's check if all constraints are met:

- Constraint 1: step3 (in front of purple_door_1)
- Constraint2: step10 (grey_door_1 unlocked)
- Constraint3: step2 (held object before step10)
- Constraint4: never in room2
- Constraint5: step7 (red_door_1 unlocked)
- Constraint6: step2
- Constraint7: step13
- Constraint8: step13 (holding purple_ball_1)
- Constraint9: step9
- Constraint10: before step9, was in room3 (step5)
- Constraint11: step15 (red_door_2 locked)
- Constraint12: step15, purple_door_1 is unlocked (step4)
- Constraint13: step4 (holding object and purple_door_1 unlocked)
- Constraint14: step14 (unlocked)
- Constraint15: step14, had held object (step2)

All constraints are satisfied. Now, can we make this shorter?

For example, after step10 (toggle grey_door_1), can we directly go to room3 and room4, then handle red_door_2? Seems like yes. Steps are as above.

Is there a way to avoid toggling red_door_2 twice? That is, can we satisfy the constraints without toggling it back to locked? Let's see:

Constraint11 requires red_door_2 to be locked at least once. Initially, it's locked. If we unlock it (step14), then the state after step14 is unlocked. Then, we need to have a state where it's locked again. But if we don't toggle it back, the only state where it's locked is the initial state. But the initial state is before any actions. So the constraint requires that in at least one state (after some actions), red_door_2 is locked. If we unlock it, then the only locked state is initial. But the constraint says "in at least one state", which could include the initial state. But the problem states that the plan must bring about the goal and satisfy the constraints. The constraints are about the entire execution, including the initial state and all intermediate states. So if the constraint requires that red_door_2 is locked in at least one state, then the initial state satisfies this. But the problem may require that the plan includes the state. Let me check the problem statement:

The constraints must hold in the plan's states. For example, the constraint "red_door_2 is locked" must hold in at least one state during the execution. The initial state has red_door_2 locked. So if during the execution, red_door_2 is locked in the initial state, then that satisfies the constraint. But after the agent toggles it (unlocks), it's no longer locked. But the constraint requires that there's at least one state where it's locked. The initial state counts. So maybe we don't need to lock it again. But the problem may require that the constraint is met in the plan's states, not counting the initial state. The problem says: "A valid plan for the abovementioned problem must abide by the following constraints". The initial state is part of the problem, so if a constraint is already satisfied in the initial state, it doesn't need to be done again. So for constraint11: "red_door_2 is locked" in at least one state. The initial state satisfies this. So perhaps we don't need to lock it again. Then, steps14 (unlock) would satisfy constraint14 (unlocked), and constraint11 is already satisfied by the initial state. Then, we can skip step15 (toggle again), saving a step.

But the problem says: "If expression "red_door_2 is locked" holds in some state s, then expression ... must hold at s or after." So if s is the initial state, then the condition must hold. The initial state has red_door_2 locked, and in the initial state, we are not holding any object, and purple_door_1 is locked. So the condition for constraint12 is:

If red_door_2 is locked in s (initial state), then during or after s, either hold green_ball_1 or purple_door_1 is unlocked. But in the initial state, purple_door_1 is locked. So after s (the initial state), during the plan's execution, purple_door_1 is unlocked (step4), so the constraint is satisfied.

Therefore, constraint11 is satisfied by the initial state. So we don't need to lock red_door_2 again. Therefore, step15 can be omitted. This reduces the plan by one step.

So revised steps:

1. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room4
2. pick purple_ball_1
3. gotodoor purple_door_1 room4 room3
4. toggle purple_door_1
5. gotoroom room4 room3
6. gotodoor red_door_1 room3 room1
7. toggle red_door_1
8. gotoroom room3 room1
9. gotodoor grey_door_1 room1 room2
10. toggle grey_door_1
11. gotoroom room1 room3
12. gotoroom room3 room4
13. gotodoor red_door_2 room4 room2
14. toggle red_door_2 (unlocks it)
15. gotoroom room4 room3
16. gotoroom room3 room1
17. gotoobject red_ball_1 room1

This is 17 steps. Now, check constraints:

- Constraint11: red_door_2 is locked in initial state, which counts. So satisfied.
- Constraint12: initial state s (red_door_2 locked), then during or after, purple_door_1 is unlocked (step4). Satisfied.
- The other constraints are still met.

This reduces the plan to 17 steps. So this is better.

Another possible optimization: after step14 (toggle red_door_2 to unlock), the agent is in front of it. Then, can they go directly to room1 via room3 without toggling back.

Yes, since red_door_2 is now unlocked, but the agent doesn't need to go through it. So steps15-16: go back to room1.

Thus, the plan is now 17 steps.

Now, check if all constraints are met:

- Constraint7: step13 (in front of red_door_2)
- Constraint8: step13 (holding purple_ball_1)
- Constraint14: step14 (unlocked)
- constraint15: step14 (unlocked), had held object (step2)
- constraint11: initial state (locked)
- All others are met.

Yes, this works. So the final plan is 17 steps. Is there any way to further optimize?

For example, after step8 (in room1), can we go to grey_door_1 and then directly to red_door_2 without going back? But room1 and red_door_2 are in different rooms. So no.

Another check: after step10 (unlock grey_door_1), the agent is in room1. Then steps11-12 to go back to room4. But room1 to room3 via red_door_1 (unlocked), then room3 to room4 via purple_door_1 (unlocked). Then step13-14.

Yes, this is necessary.

So the plan seems optimized now. Let's write it out:

```
gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4
pick purple_ball_1 room_4
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_3
toggle purple_door_1
gotoroom room_4 room_3 purple_door_1
gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1
toggle red_door_1
gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2
toggle grey_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1
gotoroom room_3 room_4 purple_door_1
gotodoor red_door_2 room_4 room_2
toggle red_door_2
gotoroom room_4 room_3 purple_door_1
gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1
gotoobject red_ball_1 room_1
```

Let's count the steps:

1. gotoobject
2. pick
3. gotodoor
4. toggle
5. gotoroom
6. gotodoor
7. toggle
8. gotoroom
9. gotodoor
10. toggle
11. gotoroom
12. gotoroom
13. gotodoor
14. toggle
15. gotoroom
16. gotoroom
17. gotoobject

Yes, 17 steps. This should be the optimal plan.
