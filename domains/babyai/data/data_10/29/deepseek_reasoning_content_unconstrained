Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. So, the goal is to have a red ball in room_1, with me also in room_1 and in front of that red ball. The initial state has me in room_4. Let's see what the initial state has.

First, the doors are all locked. The doors are grey_door_1 connecting room_1 and room_2, red_door_1 between room_1 and room_3, red_door_2 between room_2 and room_4, and purple_door_1 between room_3 and room_4. All locked. So moving between rooms requires unlocking doors, but toggling a door (unlock) requires being in front of it. But to get in front of a door, I need to be in a room connected by that door, and the position in front of the door must not be blocked by an object.

Looking at the objects: room_1 has red_ball_1 and red_ball_2. Room_2 has grey_box_1 and green_ball_1. Room_3 has blue_ball_1, red_box_1, grey_box_2. Room_4 has purple_ball_1. The boxes and balls have various colors, and the doors are colored as well.

So, the initial position is room_4. To get to room_1, I need to navigate through the doors. Since all doors are locked, I need to unlock them. But to unlock a door, I need to be in front of it. So, how can I get to the doors?

Starting in room_4. The doors connected to room_4 are red_door_2 (connecting room_2 and room_4) and purple_door_1 (connecting room_3 and room_4). Wait, room_4 is connected to room_2 via red_door_2 and to room_3 via purple_door_1. So from room_4, I can access those two doors. But to go to room_2, I need to go through red_door_2, which is in room_4's connection to room_2. But first, that door is locked. So I need to go to the door in room_4, toggle it, then go through.

Wait, the "gotodoor" action requires that the agent is in a room connected by that door and that there's no object blocking the position in front of the door. So in room_4, the doors are red_door_2 (to room_2) and purple_door_1 (to room_3). Are there any objects blocking those doors? Let's check the initial state: room_4 has purple_ball_1. But where is it located? The problem says "purple_ball_1 is in room_4". But does it block the door? The problem states that to "goto door", the position in front of d in the current room must not be blocked. So if there's an object in front of the door in room_4, then I can't go to the door. But the initial state doesn't mention any objects blocking doors. Wait, the problem mentions that the positions in front of doors are blocked if there's an object there. So, for example, if in room_4, there's an object (like purple_ball_1) in front of purple_door_1 or red_door_2, then I can't go to that door. But the initial state just says purple_ball_1 is in room_4. It doesn't specify its exact position. Hmm. The problem probably abstracts positions, so unless specified, we can assume that objects are not blocking doors. So maybe I can go to the doors in room_4.

So, starting in room_4. Let's see. The doors available here are red_door_2 (to room_2) and purple_door_1 (to room_3). Both are locked. So to unlock them, I need to go to the door, toggle it, then go through.

But the goal is to get to room_1. The path from room_4 to room_1 would be room_4 -> room_2 via red_door_2, then room_2 -> room_1 via grey_door_1. Or room_4 -> room_3 via purple_door_1, then room_3 -> room_1 via red_door_1. Let's see which path is shorter.

Option 1: room_4 to room_2 via red_door_2. But in room_2, the grey_door_1 connects to room_1. Both doors (red_door_2 and grey_door_1) are initially locked. So steps would be: go to red_door_2 in room_4, toggle (unlock), then go to room_2. Then in room_2, go to grey_door_1, toggle it (unlock), then go to room_1. Once in room_1, I need to be in front of a red ball. But the red balls are already in room_1. So perhaps after reaching room_1, go to one of the red balls and be in front of it. That's the plan.

Option 2: room_4 to room_3 via purple_door_1. Toggle purple_door_1, go to room_3. Then in room_3, red_door_1 connects to room_1. Toggle red_door_1 (unlock), then go to room_1. Then go to a red ball.

Comparing the two options. Both require two door toggles. Let's count steps. For option 1: from room_4, gotodoor red_door_2 room_4 room_2. Then toggle. Then gotoroom room_4 room_2 red_door_2. Now in room_2. Then gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_1. Toggle. Then gotoroom room_2 room_1 grey_door_1. Now in room_1. Then gotoobject red_ball_1 room_1. Then done. That's 5 actions: 2 gotodoor, 2 toggle, 2 gotoroom, 1 gotoobject. Wait, let me count:

1. gotodoor red_door_2 room_4 room_2
2. toggle red_door_2
3. gotoroom room_4 room_2 red_door_2
4. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_1
5. toggle grey_door_1
6. gotoroom room_2 room_1 grey_door_1
7. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_1

But wait, after step 3, the agent is in room_2. Then step 4: gotodoor grey_door_1 in room_2. Then toggle. Then gotoroom to room_1. Then gotoobject. So total 7 actions.

Option 2: From room_4, gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_3. Toggle. Gotoroom to room_3. Then gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1. Toggle. Gotoroom to room_1. Then gotoobject red_ball_1. Also 7 actions. Same length. So either path is possible.

But maybe there's a shorter path. Let's see. Wait, the problem requires that the final state is in room_1, in front of a red ball. The red balls are already in room_1, so maybe I don't need to move them. So the main task is getting to room_1 and then positioning in front of a red ball there. So the steps would be navigating through doors, unlocking them as needed.

But let's check if any constraints apply. The problem mentions constraints, but in the user's message, the constraints section is empty. Wait, looking back: "A valid plan for the abovementioned problem must abide by the following constraints:" but then there's nothing. Maybe that's a formatting error, but in the original problem statement, perhaps there were constraints. However, the user provided the problem as is, so perhaps there are no additional constraints beyond the action preconditions and the goal.

So, the main issue is to find the shortest path from room_4 to room_1, unlocking doors as needed. Let's consider the two options again.

But perhaps there's an even shorter path. For example, can I go from room_4 to room_3 via purple_door_1, then to room_1 via red_door_1. That's two doors. Alternatively, room_4 to room_2 via red_door_2, then room_2 to room_1 via grey_door_1. Also two doors. Both paths require unlocking two doors.

But what about the initial position? The agent is in room_4. So first, the agent must go to a door in room_4. Let's pick either red_door_2 or purple_door_1. Let's try the purple_door_1 first.

So:

1. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_3
2. toggle purple_door_1 (unlocks it)
3. gotoroom room_4 room_3 purple_door_1 (now in room_3)
4. gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1
5. toggle red_door_1 (unlocks it)
6. gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1 (now in room_1)
7. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_1

That's 7 steps. Alternatively, using the other path:

1. gotodoor red_door_2 room_4 room_2
2. toggle red_door_2
3. gotoroom room_4 room_2 red_door_2
4. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_1
5. toggle grey_door_1
6. gotoroom room_2 room_1 grey_door_1
7. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_1

Same number of steps. So both are equal. So either path is acceptable.

But perhaps there's a way to combine actions. For example, after unlocking a door, can we proceed immediately? Let's make sure the steps are correct.

Each action's preconditions must be met. For example, to do 'gotodoor', the agent must be in the same room as the door's connecting room. Let's verify each step.

First path (through purple_door_1):

1. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_3. The agent is in room_4. purple_door_1 connects room_4 and room_3. So preconditions met (agent is in room_4, which is connected via purple_door_1 to room_3). Also, no object blocking the door's position in room_4. Assuming purple_ball_1 is not blocking it. Since the problem doesn't mention any objects blocking doors, we can proceed.

2. toggle purple_door_1. The agent is in front of the door, so preconditions met.

3. gotoroom room_4 room_3 purple_door_1. Since the door is now unlocked, this is allowed. Now agent is in room_3.

4. gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1. Agent is in room_3, which is connected via red_door_1 to room_1. No object blocking door in room_3? The objects in room_3 are blue_ball_1, red_box_1, grey_box_2. If any of these are in front of red_door_1, then gotodoor is not possible. But the problem doesn't specify positions, so assuming they are not blocking. So gotodoor is allowed.

5. toggle red_door_1. Agent is in front of it.

6. gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1. Now in room_1.

7. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_1. The agent is in room_1, so allowed. Now in front of red_ball_1.

This works.

Similarly, the other path would also work. So either way, the plan is 7 steps. Is there a shorter way? Let's think.

Wait, perhaps the doors' colors can be used. For example, maybe using a key or object to unlock doors. Wait, but the actions don't involve using keys. The toggle action just toggles the door's state. So any door can be toggled if the agent is in front of it. So the color of the door doesn't matter here, unless some constraint is imposed. But the problem as given doesn't mention any constraints related to door colors. So the plan can proceed as above.

Another thing to consider: after unlocking a door, do we need to lock it again? No, the goal doesn't require doors to be in any particular state. So leaving them unlocked is fine.

Therefore, the optimal plan should have 7 steps. Both paths are equally optimal. Let's pick one. Let's go through room_3.

Wait, but wait, in room_3, after unlocking red_door_1 and going to room_1, the agent is there. The red balls are already in room_1, so no need to pick or drop anything. The goal is to have a red ball in room_1 (which it already is), and the agent in room_1 in front of it. So the steps are correct.

Another check: when the agent is in room_1, they need to be in front of a red ball. So after arriving in room_1, they need to gotoobject red_ball_1 or red_ball_2. Both are in room_1. So that's the last step.

Yes. So the plan would be:

1. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_3
2. toggle purple_door_1
3. gotoroom room_4 room_3 purple_door_1
4. gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1
5. toggle red_door_1
6. gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1
7. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_1

Alternatively, using red_ball_2. Either is acceptable. Since the goal is "there exists a ball v...", either red_ball_1 or red_ball_2 is acceptable. So the plan is valid.

Another possible optimization: after step 6, the agent is in room_1. Are they in front of anything? After gotoroom, the effect is that the agent is no longer in front of any object or door. So they are just in room_1, not in front of anything. So step 7 is necessary to go to the object.

Yes, this plan is valid.
