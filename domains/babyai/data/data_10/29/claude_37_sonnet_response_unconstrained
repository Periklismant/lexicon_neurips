Let's analyze our task. We need to be in room_1, in front of a red ball, which is also in room_1.

In the initial state:
- We are in room_4
- red_ball_1 is in room_1
- red_ball_2 is in room_1
- All doors are locked
- The rooms have connections as follows:
  - room_1 <-> room_2 via grey_door_1
  - room_1 <-> room_3 via red_door_1
  - room_2 <-> room_4 via red_door_2
  - room_3 <-> room_4 via purple_door_1

Our goal is to be in room_1, in front of a red ball, which could be either red_ball_1 or red_ball_2, since both are in room_1 and both are red.

Now, let's plan the steps:

1. We start in room_4. We need to get to room_1. There are two possible paths: 
   - room_4 -> room_2 -> room_1
   - room_4 -> room_3 -> room_1

2. All doors are locked, so we need to unlock at least one door to leave room_4 and at least one more door to enter room_1.

3. To unlock a door, we need to use the "toggle" action, and we need to be in front of the door. 

So let's first decide on our route. We can choose either path, but let's pick room_4 -> room_2 -> room_1 for this plan.

Our steps would be:
1. Go to the door red_door_2 that connects room_4 and room_2
2. Toggle red_door_2 to unlock it
3. Go to room_2 from room_4 using red_door_2
4. Go to the door grey_door_1 that connects room_2 and room_1
5. Toggle grey_door_1 to unlock it
6. Go to room_1 from room_2 using grey_door_1
7. Go to red_ball_1 (or red_ball_2) in room_1

Let's now convert these into the formal action sequence:

```
gotodoor red_door_2 room_4 room_2
toggle red_door_2
gotoroom room_4 room_2 red_door_2
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_1
toggle grey_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_1 grey_door_1
gotoobject red_ball_1 room_1
```

Let me check if this plan satisfies all the preconditions and constraints.

1. `gotodoor red_door_2 room_4 room_2`: We are in room_4, and red_door_2 connects room_4 and room_2. There's no mention of an object blocking the door, so this should be valid.
2. `toggle red_door_2`: We are now in front of red_door_2, so we can toggle it.
3. `gotoroom room_4 room_2 red_door_2`: We are in room_4, room_2 is adjacent to room_4, and red_door_2 is now unlocked, so we can go to room_2.
4. `gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_1`: We are in room_2, and grey_door_1 connects room_2 and room_1. There's no mention of an object blocking the door, so this should be valid.
5. `toggle grey_door_1`: We are now in front of grey_door_1, so we can toggle it.
6. `gotoroom room_2 room_1 grey_door_1`: We are in room_2, room_1 is adjacent to room_2, and grey_door_1 is now unlocked, so we can go to room_1.
7. `gotoobject red_ball_1 room_1`: We are in room_1, and red_ball_1 is in room_1, so we can go in front of it.

This plan seems valid, and it achieves our goal of being in room_1, in front of a red ball (red_ball_1), which is also in room_1. Let's use this plan.

Wait, let me double-check the "gotoobject" action's preconditions. The problem says:

"goto object": you may only go in front of an object x if you are in the same room as x.

And we are in room_1, red_ball_1 is in room_1, so we can go in front of red_ball_1. This seems correct.

So our final plan is:

```
gotodoor red_door_2 room_4 room_2
toggle red_door_2
gotoroom room_4 room_2 red_door_2
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_1
toggle grey_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_1 grey_door_1
gotoobject red_ball_1 room_1
```

Actually, after another thought, let's also consider the alternate route through room_3.

Our steps would be:
1. Go to the door purple_door_1 that connects room_4 and room_3
2. Toggle purple_door_1 to unlock it
3. Go to room_3 from room_4 using purple_door_1
4. Go to the door red_door_1 that connects room_3 and room_1
5. Toggle red_door_1 to unlock it
6. Go to room_1 from room_3 using red_door_1
7. Go to red_ball_1 (or red_ball_2) in room_1

Converting these into the formal action sequence:

```
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_3
toggle purple_door_1
gotoroom room_4 room_3 purple_door_1
gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1
toggle red_door_1
gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1
gotoobject red_ball_1 room_1
```

This alternate plan also seems valid. Both plans have the same number of steps, so they're both optimal in terms of plan length. I'll stick with the first plan, but either would work.

Actually, I just realized both plans share the same number of actions: 7. Since the problem asks for an optimal plan, both qualify. I'll go with the first plan for the solution.

```
gotodoor red_door_2 room_4 room_2
toggle red_door_2
gotoroom room_4 room_2 red_door_2
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_1
toggle grey_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_1 grey_door_1
gotoobject red_ball_1 room_1
```
