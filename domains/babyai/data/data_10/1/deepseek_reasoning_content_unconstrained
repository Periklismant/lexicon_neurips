Okay, let's tackle this planning problem step by step. The goal is to get a grey ball into room_4, be in room_4, and be in front of that grey ball. The initial state has the agent in room_2 with several objects in different rooms, and all doors are locked. So first, I need to figure out how to unlock doors to move between rooms and which objects might be needed to toggle the doors.

Looking at the doors and their colors: red_door_1 connects room_1 and room_2, green_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3, purple_door_1 connects room_2 and room_4, and grey_door_1 connects room_3 and room_4. All doors are locked initially. To unlock a door, I need to toggle it, which requires being in front of it. But to get in front of a door, there must be no object blocking that position. Wait, the "goto door" action's precondition says that there's no object blocking the position in front of the door in the current room. So if a door is blocked by an object, I can't go there unless I move the object first.

Let's check where the objects are. In room_2, there's blue_box_1. If that's blocking the purple_door_1 (which connects room_2 to room_4), then I can't go to that door until I move the box. But the problem statement doesn't mention any objects blocking doors in the initial state. Wait, the initial state doesn't state any blocking, so maybe the doors aren't blocked. So perhaps I can go to the doors directly.

But the doors are locked. To toggle a door, I need to be in front of it. So the plan might involve going to a door, toggling it to unlock, then moving through.

The grey balls are in room_1 (grey_ball_1), room_3 (grey_ball_2), and room_4 (grey_ball_3). The goal is any grey ball in room_4. Since grey_ball_3 is already in room_4, maybe the simplest plan is to get to room_4 and be in front of grey_ball_3. But the agent starts in room_2. Let's see the path from room_2 to room_4.

Room_2 is connected to room_4 via purple_door_1. But purple_door_1 is locked. So the agent needs to go to purple_door_1, toggle it to unlock, then go through. But can the agent go to the purple_door_1 from room_2? Since the agent is in room_2, which is connected to room_4 via purple_door_1, the agent can gotoempty or gotoobject if there's any in room_2. Wait, in room_2, there's blue_box_1. So first, maybe the agent needs to go to blue_box_1, but why? Unless moving the box is necessary. Wait, but the blue_box_1 is in room_2. If the purple_door_1's position in room_2 is not blocked, then the agent can go to the door. Let's check the initial state. The initial state says "blue_box_1 is in room_2" but doesn't mention it blocking any door. So maybe it's not blocking. So the agent can go directly to the purple_door_1 from room_2.

So steps could be:

1. Go to purple_door_1 in room_2: gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_4. But wait, the "gotodoor" action requires being in a room connected by the door. Since the agent is in room_2, which is connected to room_4 via purple_door_1, this should be possible. Then toggle the door to unlock it. Then use gotoroom room_2 room_4 purple_door_1 to move to room_4. Then, in room_4, go to grey_ball_3. But wait, the agent needs to be in front of the grey ball in room_4. So once in room_4, perform gotoobject grey_ball_3 room_4. But wait, the preconditions for gotoobject require being in the same room as the object, which would be true after moving to room_4.

But wait, in the initial state, grey_ball_3 is already in room_4. So if the agent can get to room_4 and then go in front of grey_ball_3, that would satisfy the goal. So the plan could be:

- gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_4
- toggle purple_door_1
- gotoroom room_2 room_4 purple_door_1
- gotoobject grey_ball_3 room_4

But let's check each step's preconditions.

Starting in room_2. The first action is gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_4. Preconditions: (i) agent is in a room connected by the door (room_2 is connected via purple_door_1 to room_4, yes), (ii) no object is blocking the position in front of the door in the current room. Since the initial state doesn't mention any blocking, assuming it's unblocked. So this action is possible. Then toggle purple_door_1: requires being in front of the door. After gotodoor, the agent is in front of purple_door_1, so toggle is possible. Toggling it will unlock it. Then gotoroom room_2 room_4 purple_door_1: requires the door is unlocked (now it is), so possible. Then in room_4, gotoobject grey_ball_3 room_4: agent is in room_4, so possible. Then the goal is achieved: grey_ball_3 is in room_4, agent is in room_4, and in front of it.

But wait, the initial state has grey_ball_3 in room_4, so no need to move it. The problem's goal is that there exists a grey ball in room_4 (already true), the agent is in room_4, and in front of it. So the plan seems valid. But let's check constraints.

Are there any constraints mentioned? The user says "A valid plan for the abovementioned problem must abide by the following constraints:" but then the constraints are not listed. Wait, looking back at the problem statement, it says "Provided a planning problem, consisting of an initial state of the world, a final goal and a set of constraints, your task is to provide a valid sequence of actions that solves the planning problem, i.e., bringing about the goal of the problem while satisfying all constraints."

But in the problem as given, the user didn't list any constraints except for the preconditions of the actions. Wait, looking at the problem statement again, after the task description, the user says "A valid plan for the abovementioned problem must abide by the following constraints:" but then there's nothing. Maybe it's a formatting error. Alternatively, perhaps the constraints were omitted. Assuming that there are no additional constraints beyond the action preconditions, then the plan I outlined is valid.

But wait, let's check the initial state again. The agent is in room_2. The purple_door_1 is locked. So the steps are:

1. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_4
   - Preconditions: in room_2 (yes), door connects room_2 and room_4 (yes), and no object blocking (assuming yes).
2. toggle purple_door_1
   - Precondition: in front of the door. After step 1, agent is in front of purple_door_1.
   - Effect: unlock the door.
3. gotoroom room_2 room_4 purple_door_1
   - Preconditions: in room_2 (yes), adjacent room (room_4 is connected), door is unlocked (now yes after toggle).
4. gotoobject grey_ball_3 room_4
   - Precondition: in room_4 (yes after step 3), grey_ball_3 is in room_4 (yes).

This should work. But wait, the initial state says that all doors are locked, including purple_door_1. So the toggle action on purple_door_1 will unlock it, allowing passage.

Is there a shorter plan? Let's see. The plan has four actions. Is there a way to do it in fewer steps?

Alternatively, maybe using another door. For example, from room_2 to room_4 via purple_door_1. But since purple_door_1 is locked, the steps are necessary. So the plan is optimal.

But let's verify if moving through other doors would require more steps. Suppose the agent goes from room_2 to room_4 via purple_door_1, which is the most direct path. So the steps I outlined seem optimal.

Another possible issue: when the agent uses gotoroom, they are no longer in front of any object. So after step 3, the agent is in room_4 but not in front of anything. Then step 4 is necessary to go to the grey_ball_3.

Yes, that makes sense. So the plan is valid and optimal.
