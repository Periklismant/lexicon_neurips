Let's start by understanding the problem:

1. We have a 2D gridworld with 4 rooms arranged in a square formation: room_1 (NW), room_2 (SW), room_3 (NE), room_4 (SE).
2. There are 4 doors connecting the following room pairs: room_1-room_2 (red_door_1), room_1-room_3 (green_door_1), room_2-room_4 (purple_door_1), room_3-room_4 (grey_door_1).
3. We start in room_2, and all doors are locked.

The goal is to reach a state where:
- There is a grey ball in room_4,
- We are in room_4,
- We are in front of the grey ball.

Looking at the objects, there are three grey balls:
- grey_ball_1 is in room_1,
- grey_ball_2 is in room_3,
- grey_ball_3 is in room_4.

Since grey_ball_3 is already in room_4, the simplest solution would be to go to room_4 and get in front of grey_ball_3. However, we need to check the constraints to see if this simple solution is valid.

Let's analyze the constraints:

1. "blue_box_1 is in room_4" and "you are in room_1" must be true at some point. This means we need to move blue_box_1 from room_2 to room_4 and then go to room_1.
2. "purple_door_1 is not locked" must be true at some point. And before that, we need to either be holding purple_ball_1 or be in front of it.
3. "you are in room_4" must be true at some point. But before that, we need to be holding grey_ball_1 and green_door_1 must be unlocked.
4. "purple_door_1 is locked" must be true at some point. And after that, we need to be holding grey_ball_3 at some point.
5. "you are in room_2" must be true at some point (we start here). After that, we need to be in front of purple_ball_1 at some point.
6. "you are holding some object" must be true at some point.
7. Either "grey_door_1 is not locked" or "you are in front of purple_ball_1" must be true at some point.
8. "you are in front of grey_ball_3" must be true at some point. But before that, "you are holding some object" must be true.

These constraints give us a sequence of actions to follow. Let's trace through a potential plan:

1. We start in room_2.
2. We need to be in front of purple_ball_1 at some point (constraint 5). purple_ball_1 is in room_3, so we need to go to room_3.
3. To go to room_3, we need to unlock green_door_1 or go through room_1. Both require unlocking doors, so we need to find a way to unlock doors.
4. We need to be holding grey_ball_1 before we can go to room_4 (constraint 3). grey_ball_1 is in room_1. So, we need to go to room_1 first.
5. To go to room_1, we need to unlock red_door_1.
6. To unlock red_door_1, we need to be in front of it and then toggle it.

Actually, I'm not considering the full problem correctly, as rooms and doors are bidirectional. Let's trace through the problem step by step:

1. We start in room_2.
2. To unlock red_door_1, which connects room_2 and room_1, we need to go in front of it and toggle it.
3. Then, we can go to room_1 and pick up grey_ball_1.
4. Once we have grey_ball_1, we need to unlock green_door_1, which connects room_1 and room_3. We go in front of it and toggle it.
5. Now, we can go to room_3, where purple_ball_1 is. We might need to drop grey_ball_1 to interact with purple_ball_1.
6. After interaction with purple_ball_1 (being in front of it or picking it up), we can unlock purple_door_1.
7. We need to also bring blue_box_1 to room_4. Since blue_box_1 is in room_2, we need to go back to room_2, pick it up, and then take it to room_4.
8. Finally, we can go to room_4 and get in front of grey_ball_3.

But there's another constraint: "If purple_door_1 is locked holds in some state s, then you are holding grey_ball_3 must hold at s or at some state after s." This means we need to pick up grey_ball_3 after locking purple_door_1.

Let's plan this out systematically:

Step 1: Unlock red_door_1 to access room_1.
- Go in front of red_door_1 in room_2.
- Toggle red_door_1.

Step 2: Go to room_1 and pick up grey_ball_1.
- Go through red_door_1 to room_1.
- Go in front of grey_ball_1.
- Pick up grey_ball_1.

Step 3: Unlock green_door_1 to access room_3.
- Go in front of green_door_1 in room_1.
- Toggle green_door_1.

Step 4: Go to room_3 to interact with purple_ball_1.
- Go through green_door_1 to room_3.
- Drop grey_ball_1 (to free hands).
- Go in front of purple_ball_1.
- Pick up purple_ball_1.

Step 5: Unlock purple_door_1 to access room_4.
- Go back to room_1.
- Go to room_2.
- Go in front of purple_door_1.
- Toggle purple_door_1 (to unlock it).

Step 6: Move blue_box_1 to room_4.
- Go in front of blue_box_1 in room_2.
- Drop purple_ball_1 (to free hands).
- Pick up blue_box_1.
- Go through purple_door_1 to room_4.
- Drop blue_box_1.

Step 7: Go back to room_1 (constraint 1).
- Go back to room_2.
- Go to room_1.

Step 8: Lock purple_door_1 and then pick up grey_ball_3.
- Go back to room_2.
- Go in front of purple_door_1.
- Toggle purple_door_1 (to lock it).
- Go to room_4.
- Go in front of grey_ball_3.
- Pick up grey_ball_3.

However, there seems to be a conflict. Constraint 4 suggests we need to go to room_4 after holding grey_ball_1 and unlocking green_door_1. But to do this, we need to unlock purple_door_1, which requires interacting with purple_ball_1 in room_3. I have to re-evaluate the sequence of actions.

Actually, let's be a bit more structured. Let's first list the objects and their initial locations, then list the constraints more clearly, and then plan out a valid sequence of actions.

Objects:
- grey_ball_1: room_1
- red_ball_1: room_1
- blue_box_1: room_2
- red_box_1: room_3
- green_box_1: room_3
- grey_ball_2: room_3
- purple_ball_1: room_3
- grey_ball_3: room_4

Doors:
- red_door_1: Connects room_1 and room_2
- green_door_1: Connects room_1 and room_3
- purple_door_1: Connects room_2 and room_4
- grey_door_1: Connects room_3 and room_4

Initial State:
- We are in room_2.
- All doors are locked.
- We have no object in hand.

Goal:
- There's a grey ball in room_4.
- We are in room_4.
- We are in front of the grey ball.

Constraints:
1. At some point, blue_box_1 must be in room_4 and we must be in room_1.
2. purple_door_1 must be unlocked at some point. Before unlocking it, we must interact with purple_ball_1.
3. We must be in room_4 at some point. Before going to room_4, we must have grey_ball_1 in hand and green_door_1 must be unlocked.
4. purple_door_1 must be locked at some point. After locking it, we must pick up grey_ball_3 at some point.
5. After being in room_2, we must be in front of purple_ball_1 at some point.
6. We must hold some object at some point.
7. Either grey_door_1 is unlocked or we are in front of purple_ball_1 at some point.
8. We must be in front of grey_ball_3 at some point. Before that, we must have held some object.

Now, let's think of a plan step by step:

1. We start in room_2.
2. We need to unlock red_door_1 to access room_1:
   - gotoobject red_door_1 room_2
   - toggle red_door_1

3. Go to room_1 and pick up grey_ball_1:
   - gotoroom room_2 room_1 red_door_1
   - gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_1
   - pick grey_ball_1 room_1

4. Unlock green_door_1 to access room_3:
   - gotoobject green_door_1 room_1
   - toggle green_door_1

5. Go to room_3 to interact with purple_ball_1 (constraint 5):
   - gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1
   - gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_3
   
6. Need to drop grey_ball_1 to pick up purple_ball_1:
   - gotoempty
   - drop grey_ball_1 room_3
   - gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_3
   - pick purple_ball_1 room_3

7. Unlock purple_door_1 to access room_4 (constraint 2):
   - gotoroom room_3 room_1 green_door_1
   - gotoroom room_1 room_2 red_door_1
   - gotoobject purple_door_1 room_2
   - gotoempty
   - drop purple_ball_1 room_2
   - gotoobject purple_door_1 room_2
   - toggle purple_door_1

8. Pick up blue_box_1 and move it to room_4 (constraint 1):
   - gotoobject blue_box_1 room_2
   - pick blue_box_1 room_2
   - gotoobject purple_door_1 room_2
   - gotoroom room_2 room_4 purple_door_1
   - gotoempty
   - drop blue_box_1 room_4

9. Go back to room_1 (constraint 1):
   - gotoobject purple_door_1 room_4
   - gotoroom room_4 room_2 purple_door_1
   - gotoobject red_door_1 room_2
   - gotoroom room_2 room_1 red_door_1

10. Go back to room_3 and pick up grey_ball_1:
    - gotoobject green_door_1 room_1
    - gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1
    - gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_3
    - pick grey_ball_1 room_3

11. Go to room_4 (constraint 3, we now have grey_ball_1 in hand and green_door_1 is unlocked):
    - We need to decide which route to take: room_3 -> grey_door_1 -> room_4 or room_3 -> room_1 -> room_2 -> purple_door_1 -> room_4.
    - If we take the first route, we need to unlock grey_door_1. 
    - If we take the second route, we can access room_4 via purple_door_1 which is already unlocked.
    - Let's go through room_3 -> room_1 -> room_2 -> purple_door_1 -> room_4:
    
    - gotoobject green_door_1 room_3
    - gotoroom room_3 room_1 green_door_1
    - gotoobject red_door_1 room_1
    - gotoroom room_1 room_2 red_door_1
    - gotoobject purple_door_1 room_2
    - gotoroom room_2 room_4 purple_door_1

12. Lock purple_door_1 (constraint 4):
    - gotoobject purple_door_1 room_4
    - gotoempty
    - drop grey_ball_1 room_4
    - gotoobject purple_door_1 room_4
    - toggle purple_door_1

13. Pick up grey_ball_3 (constraint 4):
    - gotoobject grey_ball_3 room_4
    - pick grey_ball_3 room_4

14. Get in front of a grey ball in room_4 (goal):
    - If holding grey_ball_3, drop it:
    - gotoempty
    - drop grey_ball_3 room_4
    - Now, get in front of a grey ball (either grey_ball_3 or grey_ball_1):
    - gotoobject grey_ball_3 room_4

But wait, we have a constraint "you are in front of grey_ball_3 must be true at some point. But before that, you are holding some object must be true." And we've been holding objects before, so this constraint should be satisfied.

Let's recheck the constraints to ensure our plan is valid:

1. "blue_box_1 is in room_4" and "you are in room_1" must be true at some point.
   - We move blue_box_1 to room_4 in step 8.
   - We go back to room_1 in step 9.
   - Satisfied!

2. "purple_door_1 is not locked" must be true at some point. And before that, we need to either be holding purple_ball_1 or be in front of it.
   - We interact with purple_ball_1 in step 6.
   - We unlock purple_door_1 in step 7.
   - Satisfied!

3. "you are in room_4" must be true at some point. But before that, we need to be holding grey_ball_1 and green_door_1 must be unlocked.
   - We unlock green_door_1 in step 4.
   - We pick up grey_ball_1 in step 10.
   - We go to room_4 in step 11.
   - Satisfied!

4. "purple_door_1 is locked" must be true at some point. And after that, we need to be holding grey_ball_3 at some point.
   - We lock purple_door_1 in step 12.
   - We pick up grey_ball_3 in step 13.
   - Satisfied!

5. "you are in room_2" must be true at some point (we start here). After that, we need to be in front of purple_ball_1 at some point.
   - We start in room_2.
   - We get in front of purple_ball_1 in step 5.
   - Satisfied!

6. "you are holding some object" must be true at some point.
   - We hold several objects throughout the plan.
   - Satisfied!

7. Either "grey_door_1 is not locked" or "you are in front of purple_ball_1" must be true at some point.
   - We are in front of purple_ball_1 in step 5.
   - Satisfied!

8. "you are in front of grey_ball_3" must be true at some point. Before that, "you are holding some object" must be true.
   - We hold objects before getting in front of grey_ball_3.
   - We get in front of grey_ball_3 in steps 13 and 14.
   - Satisfied!

So, our plan satisfies all the constraints. Let's summarize the final plan:

1. gotoobject red_door_1 room_2
2. toggle red_door_1
3. gotoroom room_2 room_1 red_door_1
4. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_1
5. pick grey_ball_1 room_1
6. gotoobject green_door_1 room_1
7. toggle green_door_1
8. gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1
9. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_3
10. gotoempty
11. drop grey_ball_1 room_3
12. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_3
13. pick purple_ball_1 room_3
14. gotoobject green_door_1 room_3
15. gotoroom room_3 room_1 green_door_1
16. gotoobject red_door_1 room_1
17. gotoroom room_1 room_2 red_door_1
18. gotoobject purple_door_1 room_2
19. gotoempty
20. drop purple_ball_1 room_2
21. gotoobject purple_door_1 room_2
22. toggle purple_door_1
23. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_2
24. pick blue_box_1 room_2
25. gotoobject purple_door_1 room_2
26. gotoroom room_2 room_4 purple_door_1
27. gotoempty
28. drop blue_box_1 room_4
29. gotoobject purple_door_1 room_4
30. gotoroom room_4 room_2 purple_door_1
31. gotoobject red_door_1 room_2
32. gotoroom room_2 room_1 red_door_1
33. gotoobject green_door_1 room_1
34. gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1
35. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_3
36. pick grey_ball_1 room_3
37. gotoobject green_door_1 room_3
38. gotoroom room_3 room_1 green_door_1
39. gotoobject red_door_1 room_1
40. gotoroom room_1 room_2 red_door_1
41. gotoobject purple_door_1 room_2
42. gotoroom room_2 room_4 purple_door_1
43. gotoobject purple_door_1 room_4
44. gotoempty
45. drop grey_ball_1 room_4
46. gotoobject purple_door_1 room_4
47. toggle purple_door_1
48. gotoobject grey_ball_3 room_4
49. pick grey_ball_3 room_4
50. gotoempty
51. drop grey_ball_3 room_4
52. gotoobject grey_ball_3 room_4

Upon re-evaluating the plan, it seems good, but I just realized we are also targeting a particular goal: to have a grey ball in room_4, to be in room_4, and to be in front of the grey ball. Since grey_ball_3 is already in room_4, we can simplify our plan to ending with step 52.

Actually looking at the constraints again, I realized there's another problem with our plan. Constraint 2 says "purple_door_1 is not locked must be true at some point. And before that, we need to either be holding purple_ball_1 or be in front of it." We correctly unlock purple_door_1 after interacting with purple_ball_1.

But constraint 3 says "you are in room_4 must be true at some point. But before that, we need to be holding grey_ball_1 and green_door_1 must be unlocked." We are meant to go to room_4 while holding grey_ball_1 (after already unlocking green_door_1).

In our current plan, after unlocking purple_door_1, we bring blue_box_1 to room_4, then go back to room_3 to pick up grey_ball_1, and then go to room_4 again. This seems to satisfy the constraints. We're holding grey_ball_1 before going to room_4 (in step 42).

Actually, no. When we go to room_4 in step 26, I don't think we're holding grey_ball_1. We're holding blue_box_1 at that point. But when we revisit room_4 in step 42, we are holding grey_ball_1 (after picking it up in step 36), so this part of the constraint is satisfied.

I see the confusion now. After we've gone to room_4 in step 26, the statement "you are in room_4" becomes true. The constraint says "If 'you are in room_4' holds at some state, then there must be an earlier state in which 'you are holding grey_ball_1' and 'green_door_1 is not locked' both hold". But in our plan, we haven't held grey_ball_1 before step 26. We only pick up grey_ball_1 in step 36, which is after we've been to room_4.

Let's fix this. We need to be holding grey_ball_1 before going to room_4 for the first time.

Let's adjust the plan:

1. gotoobject red_door_1 room_2
2. toggle red_door_1
3. gotoroom room_2 room_1 red_door_1
4. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_1
5. pick grey_ball_1 room_1
6. gotoobject green_door_1 room_1
7. toggle green_door_1
8. gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1
9. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_3
10. gotoempty
11. drop grey_ball_1 room_3
12. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_3
13. pick purple_ball_1 room_3
14. gotoroom room_3 room_1 green_door_1
15. gotoroom room_1 room_2 red_door_1
16. gotoobject purple_door_1 room_2
17. gotoempty
18. drop purple_ball_1 room_2
19. gotoobject purple_door_1 room_2
20. toggle purple_door_1
21. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_2
22. pick blue_box_1 room_2
23. gotoroom room_2 room_1 red_door_1
24. gotoempty
25. drop blue_box_1 room_1

Now, let's pick up grey_ball_1 before going to room_4:

26. gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1
27. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_3
28. pick grey_ball_1 room_3
29. gotoroom room_3 room_1 green_door_1
30. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1
31. gotoempty
32. drop grey_ball_1 room_1
33. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1
34. pick blue_box_1 room_1
35. gotoroom room_1 room_2 red_door_1
36. gotoobject purple_door_1 room_2
37. gotoroom room_2 room_4 purple_door_1
38. gotoempty
39. drop blue_box_1 room_4

Now, go back to pick up grey_ball_1 and bring it to room_4:

40. gotoroom room_4 room_2 purple_door_1
41. gotoroom room_2 room_1 red_door_1
42. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_1
43. pick grey_ball_1 room_1
44. gotoroom room_1 room_2 red_door_1
45. gotoobject purple_door_1 room_2
46. gotoroom room_2 room_4 purple_door_1

Now, we need to lock purple_door_1 and then pick up grey_ball_3:

47. gotoobject purple_door_1 room_4
48. gotoempty
49. drop grey_ball_1 room_4
50. gotoobject purple_door_1 room_4
51. toggle purple_door_1
52. gotoobject grey_ball_3 room_4
53. pick grey_ball_3 room_4
54. gotoempty
55. drop grey_ball_3 room_4
56. gotoobject grey_ball_3 room_4

Actually, I think we're missing a few constraints again.

Constraint 1 says "blue_box_1 is in room_4" and "you are in room_1" must be true at some point.
Currently, in step 39, we drop blue_box_1 in room_4. But we need to be in room_1 after this to satisfy the constraint. In step 41, we are in room_1, so we satisfy this constraint.

Actually, let me go through and verify the constraints step by step with my updated plan:

1. At some point, blue_box_1 must be in room_4 and we must be in room_1.
   - We move blue_box_1 to room_4 in step 39.
   - We go to room_1 in step 41.
   - Satisfied!

2. purple_door_1 must be unlocked at some point. Before unlocking it, we must interact with purple_ball_1.
   - We interact with purple_ball_1 in step 12-13.
   - We unlock purple_door_1 in step 20.
   - Satisfied!

3. We must be in room_4 at some point. Before going to room_4, we must have grey_ball_1 in hand and green_door_1 must be unlocked.
   - We unlock green_door_1 in step 7.
   - We pick up grey_ball_1 in step 43.
   - We go to room_4 in step 46.
   - Satisfied!

Ah, wait. I think there's a mistake in my understanding. The constraint doesn't necessarily mean we have to be in room_4 WHILE holding grey_ball_1. It just means that before we ever go to room_4, we must have held grey_ball_1 (maybe we put it down by then) and green_door_1 must be unlocked.

Let me reintegrate the constraints. Before we go to room_4, we must have at some point held grey_ball_1 and green_door_1 must be unlocked. We unlock green_door_1 in step 7, and we pick up grey_ball_1 in step 5, so by the time we go to room_4 in step 37, we have satisfied this constraint.

Let's continue:

4. purple_door_1 must be locked at some point. After locking it, we need to be holding grey_ball_3 at some point.
   - We lock purple_door_1 in step 51.
   - We pick up grey_ball_3 in step 53.
   - Satisfied!

5. After being in room_2, we need to be in front of purple_ball_1 at some point.
   - We start in room_2.
   - We get in front of purple_ball_1 in step 12.
   - Satisfied!

6. We must hold some object at some point.
   - We hold several objects throughout the plan.
   - Satisfied!

7. Either grey_door_1 is unlocked or we are in front of purple_ball_1 at some point.
   - We are in front of purple_ball_1 in step 12.
   - Satisfied!

8. We must be in front of grey_ball_3 at some point. Before that, we must have held some object.
   - We hold objects before getting in front of grey_ball_3.
   - We get in front of grey_ball_3 in step 52.
   - Satisfied!

My plan seems to satisfy all constraints. Now, I've made changes to when we handle blue_box_1, making sure we handle it after interacting with purple_ball_1 and ensuring we are in room_1 after putting it in room_4.

There seems to be a mistake in my planning. In step 24-25, I have us drop blue_box_1 in room_1, but I just realized it was never in room_1 to begin with. It's in room_2. Let me re-correct the plan.

Actually, let me just rewrite the plan from scratch to avoid confusion:

1. gotoobject red_door_1 room_2
2. toggle red_door_1
3. gotoroom room_2 room_1 red_door_1
4. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_1
5. pick grey_ball_1 room_1
6. gotoobject green_door_1 room_1
7. toggle green_door_1
8. gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1
9. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_3
10. gotoempty
11. drop grey_ball_1 room_3
12. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_3
13. pick purple_ball_1 room_3
14. gotoroom room_3 room_1 green_door_1
15. gotoroom room_1 room_2 red_door_1
16. gotoobject purple_door_1 room_2
17. gotoempty
18. drop purple_ball_1 room_2
19. gotoobject purple_door_1 room_2
20. toggle purple_door_1
21. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_2
22. pick blue_box_1 room_2
23. gotoobject purple_door_1 room_2
24. gotoroom room_2 room_4 purple_door_1
25. gotoempty
26. drop blue_box_1 room_4
27. gotoobject purple_door_1 room_4
28. gotoroom room_4 room_2 purple_door_1
29. gotoobject red_door_1 room_2
30. gotoroom room_2 room_1 red_door_1

We now have blue_box_1 in room_4 and we are in room_1, satisfying constraint 1.

31. gotoobject green_door_1 room_1
32. gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1
33. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_3
34. pick grey_ball_1 room_3
35. gotoobject green_door_1 room_3
36. gotoroom room_3 room_1 green_door_1
37. gotoobject red_door_1 room_1
38. gotoroom room_1 room_2 red_door_1
39. gotoobject purple_door_1 room_2
40. gotoroom room_2 room_4 purple_door_1

We now go to room_4 while holding grey_ball_1, and green_door_1 is already unlocked, satisfying constraint 3.

41. gotoobject purple_door_1 room_4
42. gotoempty
43. drop grey_ball_1 room_4
44. gotoobject purple_door_1 room_4
45. toggle purple_door_1

We now lock purple_door_1, satisfying part of constraint 4.

46. gotoobject grey_ball_3 room_4
47. pick grey_ball_3 room_4

We pick up grey_ball_3 after locking purple_door_1, satisfying the rest of constraint 4.

48. gotoempty
49. drop grey_ball_3 room_4
50. gotoobject grey_ball_3 room_4

We end up in front of grey_ball_3 in room_4, satisfying the goal.

Let's check the constraints one last time:

1. blue_box_1 is in room_4 (step 26) and we are in room_1 (step 30): Satisfied.
2. purple_door_1 is not locked (step 20) and before that, we interacted with purple_ball_1 (step 12-13): Satisfied.
3. We are in room_4 (step 40) and before that, we were holding grey_ball_1 (step 34-40) and green_door_1 was unlocked (step 7): Satisfied.
4. purple_door_1 is locked (step 45) and after that, we pick up grey_ball_3 (step 47): Satisfied.
5. After being in room_2 (initial state), we get in front of purple_ball_1 (step 12): Satisfied.
6. We hold several objects throughout the plan: Satisfied.
7. We are in front of purple_ball_1 at step 12: Satisfied.
8. We are in front of grey_ball_3 (step 46-47 and step 50) and before that, we've held objects: Satisfied.

All constraints seem to be satisfied. Here's the final plan:

1. gotoobject red_door_1 room_2
2. toggle red_door_1
3. gotoroom room_2 room_1 red_door_1
4. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_1
5. pick grey_ball_1 room_1
6. gotoobject green_door_1 room_1
7. toggle green_door_1
8. gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1
9. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_3
10. gotoempty
11. drop grey_ball_1 room_3
12. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_3
13. pick purple_ball_1 room_3
14. gotoroom room_3 room_1 green_door_1
15. gotoroom room_1 room_2 red_door_1
16. gotoobject purple_door_1 room_2
17. gotoempty
18. drop purple_ball_1 room_2
19. gotoobject purple_door_1 room_2
20. toggle purple_door_1
21. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_2
22. pick blue_box_1 room_2
23. gotoobject purple_door_1 room_2
24. gotoroom room_2 room_4 purple_door_1
25. gotoempty
26. drop blue_box_1 room_4
27. gotoobject purple_door_1 room_4
28. gotoroom room_4 room_2 purple_door_1
29. gotoobject red_door_1 room_2
30. gotoroom room_2 room_1 red_door_1
31. gotoobject green_door_1 room_1
32. gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1
33. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_3
34. pick grey_ball_1 room_3
35. gotoobject green_door_1 room_3
36. gotoroom room_3 room_1 green_door_1
37. gotoobject red_door_1 room_1
38. gotoroom room_1 room_2 red_door_1
39. gotoobject purple_door_1 room_2
40. gotoroom room_2 room_4 purple_door_1
41. gotoobject purple_door_1 room_4
42. gotoempty
43. drop grey_ball_1 room_4
44. gotoobject purple_door_1 room_4
45. toggle purple_door_1
46. gotoobject grey_ball_3 room_4
47. pick grey_ball_3 room_4
48. gotoempty
49. drop grey_ball_3 room_4
50. gotoobject grey_ball_3 room_4

Actually our plan isn't fully satisfying the constraints yet. The 8th constraint says "you are in front of grey_ball_3 must be true at some point. Before that, you are holding some object must be true." The phrasing "before that" means before we are in front of grey_ball_3, not after. In our plan, we have held objects before getting in front of grey_ball_3, so this constraint is satisfied.

Looking back at the constraints, I want to make one more check. Constraint 5 says "If 'you are in room_2' holds in some state s, then 'you are in front of purple_ball_1' must hold at s or at some state after s."

We start in room_2, so the antecedent "you are in room_2" is true from the beginning. The consequent requires us to be in front of purple_ball_1 at some point, which we are in step 12, so this constraint is satisfied.

Similarly, constraint 7 says "Either 'grey_door_1 is not locked' or 'you are in front of purple_ball_1' must be true at some point." We are in front of purple_ball_1 in step 12, so this constraint is satisfied.

I think our plan is indeed valid and satisfies all constraints. Here's the final optimal plan:

1. gotoobject red_door_1 room_2
2. toggle red_door_1
3. gotoroom room_2 room_1 red_door_1
4. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_1
