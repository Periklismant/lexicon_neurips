Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. Hmm, the goal is to have a grey ball in room_4, with me in room_4 and in front of that ball. The constraints are a bit complex, so I need to make sure each one is satisfied in the plan. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the initial state: I'm in room_2. The doors are all locked. The grey_ball_1 and red_ball_1 are in room_1, blue_box_1 in room_2, red_box_1, green_box_1, grey_ball_2, and purple_ball_1 in room_3, and grey_ball_3 in room_4. So the target grey ball is grey_ball_3 in room_4. Wait, the goal says "a ball v such that v is grey, in room_4..." so grey_ball_3 is already there. But I need to be in room_4 and in front of it. But how do I get there since all doors are locked?

But the constraints complicate things. Let's list the constraints:

1. At some state, blue_box_1 must be in room_4 and I must be in room_1.
2. Purple_door_1 must be unlocked at some point.
3. If purple_door_1 is unlocked, then earlier I was holding or in front of purple_ball_1.
4. I must be in room_4 at some state.
5. If I'm in room_4, earlier I was holding grey_ball_1 and green_door_1 was unlocked.
6. Purple_door_1 must be locked at some state.
7. If purple_door_1 is locked in a state, then I must be holding grey_ball_3 at that state or after.
8. I must be in room_2 at some state.
9. If I'm in room_2 in a state, then later I must be in front of purple_ball_1.
10. I must be holding some object at some state.
11. At some state, either grey_door_1 is unlocked or I'm in front of purple_ball_1.
12. I must be in front of grey_ball_3 at some state.
13. If I'm in front of grey_ball_3, then earlier I was holding some object.

So the plan has to satisfy all these. Let's start by figuring out how to get to room_4. The doors connecting room_2 to room_4 is purple_door_1, but it's locked. To unlock it, I need to toggle it, which requires being in front of it. But to get to purple_door_1 from room_2, I need to go to the door. However, if there's an object blocking the door's position, I can't go there. Wait, the initial state mentions that objects can block doors. Let's check the initial positions. In room_2, there's blue_box_1. If the purple_door_1 is in room_2, is blue_box_1 blocking it? The initial state doesn't say any objects are blocking doors, so maybe they aren't. So maybe I can go to the door, toggle it, then go through.

But first, the constraints. Let's handle the constraint that when I'm in room_4, there must have been a state where I was holding grey_ball_1 and green_door_1 was unlocked. Grey_ball_1 is in room_1. So to hold it, I need to get to room_1. But room_1 is connected to room_2 via red_door_1, which is locked. Also, room_1 is connected to room_3 via green_door_1, which is locked. So I need to unlock those doors.

Wait, but how do I unlock red_door_1? To toggle it, I need to be in front of it. So from room_2, I can go to red_door_1 (since room_2 and room_1 are connected via red_door_1). So maybe:

1. gotoempty in room_2 (since there's blue_box_1; but wait, gotoempty just goes to an empty spot. Then, gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_1. Wait, but if the door is locked, can I go in front of it? The preconditions for gotodoor are that I'm in a room connected by the door, and no object is blocking the position. Assuming blue_box_1 isn't blocking, then yes. Then toggle red_door_1 to unlock it. Then go to room_1 via red_door_1. Then pick grey_ball_1. But then I need to unlock green_door_1 as per constraint 5. So after getting to room_1, perhaps go to green_door_1 (room_1 and room_3 are connected via green_door_1), toggle it to unlock, then maybe that satisfies the green_door_1 being unlocked when I later go to room_4. But how does that connect to getting to room_4?

Alternatively, maybe I need to first get to room_3, then room_4 via grey_door_1. But grey_door_1 is locked. So need to unlock that as well.

This is getting complicated. Let's outline possible steps:

- Start in room_2. Need to unlock doors to move around.

First, unlock red_door_1 (connects room_2 and room_1) to access room_1. Then, go to room_1, pick grey_ball_1. Then unlock green_door_1 (connects room_1 and room_3). Then go to room_3. Then unlock grey_door_1 (connects room_3 and room_4) to get to room_4. But also, need to handle purple_door_1 (connects room_2 and room4). But according to the constraints, purple_door_1 must be unlocked at some point (constraint 2), and then locked again (constraint 6). Also, when unlocking purple_door_1, I must have been holding or in front of purple_ball_1 (constraint3). Purple_ball_1 is in room_3. So maybe I need to go to room_3, get in front of purple_ball_1, then unlock purple_door_1. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps using the purple_door_1 path. Let's think:

Start in room_2. Unlock purple_door_1 (which is in room_2). To do that, I need to be in front of it. So:

1. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room4 (but need to check if possible). If I'm in room_2, gotodoor purple_door_1 room2 room4. Then toggle to unlock. Then, to satisfy constraint3, before unlocking purple_door_1, I need to have been holding purple_ball_1 or in front of it. But purple_ball_1 is in room_3. So unless I can get to room_3 first. But to get to room_3, I need to go through room_1 via green_door_1 (which is locked), or from room_4 via grey_door_1 (which is locked). Alternatively, maybe from room_2 to room_4 via purple_door_1 once unlocked, then to room_3 via grey_door_1. But that would require unlocking grey_door_1 as well.

But let's see. To unlock purple_door_1, I have to be in front of it. So in room_2, gotodoor purple_door_1, toggle. But according to constraint3, when I unlock purple_door_1, I must have previously been holding or in front of purple_ball_1. But that's in room_3. So how can I satisfy that? Unless I first go to room_3, get in front of purple_ball_1, then somehow return to room_2 to unlock purple_door_1. But how to get to room_3?

Alternatively, maybe the sequence is:

- Go to room_1 via red_door_1 (unlock it first), then to room_3 via green_door_1 (unlock it). In room_3, get in front of purple_ball_1 (so constraint3 is satisfied), then go back to room_2 via green_door_1 and red_door_1, then unlock purple_door_1. But that's a long path.

Alternatively, maybe use the grey_door_1. Let's see.

But let's consider all constraints. Let's list the required states:

- blue_box_1 in room_4 and me in room_1. So at some point, I need to move blue_box_1 from room_2 to room_4, and be in room_1. How? To move blue_box_1, I need to pick it up and drop it in room_4. But blue_box_1 is in room_2 initially. So I can pick it up in room_2, then carry it to room_4. But to get to room_4, I need to unlock purple_door_1 (from room_2) or go through room_3 via grey_door_1. But moving blue_box_1 to room_4 would require me to be in room_4 to drop it. So, perhaps:

After unlocking purple_door_1, go from room_2 to room_4, drop blue_box_1 there, then go back to room_1. But how to get back to room_1? From room_4, via purple_door_1 back to room_2, then to room_1 via red_door_1. But this would require multiple trips.

But the constraint says that in some state, blue_box_1 is in room_4 and I'm in room_1. So perhaps after dropping blue_box_1 in room_4, I go back to room_1. So that state would satisfy the constraint.

Now, let's think of a possible plan:

1. In room_2: gotoempty (to position in front of nothing)
2. gotodoor red_door_1 room2 room1 (to stand in front of red_door_1)
3. toggle red_door_1 (unlocks it)
4. gotoroom room2 room1 red_door_1 (now in room1)
5. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room1 (to pick it up)
6. pick grey_ball_1 room1 (now holding it)
   - This satisfies constraint10 (holding some object)
7. Now, need to unlock green_door_1 (since constraint5 requires that when I'm in room4, there was a state where green_door_1 was unlocked and I was holding grey_ball_1. So if I unlock green_door_1 while holding grey_ball_1, that would satisfy part of constraint5.

But to unlock green_door_1, which is between room1 and room3. So:

8. gotodoor green_door_1 room1 room3
9. toggle green_door_1 (unlocks it)
   - Now green_door_1 is unlocked.

At this point, I'm in room1, holding grey_ball_1, and green_door_1 is unlocked. So this satisfies the condition for constraint5 (when I later get to room4, I need to have had a state where I was holding grey_ball_1 and green_door_1 was unlocked. So that's done here.

Then, perhaps proceed to room3 via green_door_1.

10. gotoroom room1 room3 green_door_1 (now in room3)
11. Now, in room3. Need to get to purple_ball_1 to satisfy constraint3 (when unlocking purple_door_1, need to have been in front of it or holding it). So:

12. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room3
    - Now in front of purple_ball_1. This satisfies the condition for constraint3. So later when we unlock purple_door_1, this state will have been before.

But wait, the constraint says that if purple_door_1 is unlocked in some state, there must be an earlier state where I was holding or in front of purple_ball_1. So this step would cover that.

Now, perhaps return to room2 via green_door_1 and red_door_1, then go to purple_door_1 to unlock it. But that's a long way. Alternatively, from room3, can I go to room4 via grey_door_1? But grey_door_1 is locked. So need to unlock it. But unlocking grey_door_1 would require being in front of it. Let's see:

13. gotodoor grey_door_1 room3 room4
14. toggle grey_door_1 (unlocks it)
15. gotoroom room3 room4 grey_door_1 (now in room4)
16. Now in room4. But the goal requires me to be in room4 in front of grey_ball_3, which is already there. But I need to drop grey_ball_1 here? Wait, no. The goal is that there exists a grey ball in room4 (grey_ball_3 is already there), and I'm in room4 and in front of it. So I just need to get to room4 and in front of grey_ball_3.

But how? Currently, I'm in room4, holding grey_ball_1. Let's proceed.

17. drop grey_ball_1 room4 (so now I'm in front of it, but grey_ball_3 is also in room4. But the goal requires being in front of a grey ball in room4. So perhaps I can go to grey_ball_3.

Wait, but after dropping grey_ball_1, I can then gotoobject grey_ball_3 room4. But I need to have grey_ball_3 in room4, which it is. So:

18. gotoobject grey_ball_3 room4
19. Now, the goal is satisfied: I'm in room4, in front of grey_ball_3, which is grey and in room4.

But we need to check all constraints. Let's check the constraints one by one.

1. blue_box_1 in room4 and me in room1: Not yet done. So need to move blue_box_1 to room4 and be in room1.

Currently, blue_box_1 is in room2. So I need to pick it up and move it to room4. But how?

Wait, in the current plan steps, after step 16, I'm in room4. But to move blue_box_1, I need to go back to room2, pick it up, then take it to room4. Let's adjust the plan.

But this is getting complex. Let's see:

After step 10: in room3.

Wait, perhaps after unlocking green_door_1 and being in room3 (step10), I need to go back to room1, then room2, then to room4 via purple_door_1. But unlocking purple_door_1 requires being in front of it. So steps:

From room3:

11. gotoroom room3 room1 green_door_1 (back to room1)
12. gotoroom room1 room2 red_door_1 (back to room2)
13. gotodoor purple_door_1 room2 room4
14. toggle purple_door_1 (unlocks it)
    - Now purple_door_1 is unlocked (satisfies constraint2)
    - Earlier, in step12 (step12 in the earlier list was in room3, but need to track correctly), when we were in front of purple_ball_1 (step12 in original plan), that satisfies constraint3.

15. gotoroom room2 room4 purple_door_1 (now in room4)
16. drop grey_ball_1 room4 (since we need to have hands free to pick blue_box_1)
17. gotoempty (to leave front of object)
18. gotoroom room4 room2 purple_door_1 (back to room2)
19. gotoobject blue_box_1 room2
20. pick blue_box_1 room2 (now holding it)
21. gotoroom room2 room4 purple_door_1 (back to room4)
22. drop blue_box_1 room4 (now blue_box_1 is in room4)
23. Now, need to get back to room1. So from room4, go back to room2 via purple_door_1, then to room1 via red_door_1.

24. gotoroom room4 room2 purple_door_1
25. gotoroom room2 room1 red_door_1 (now in room1)
    - Now, in room1 with blue_box_1 in room4. This satisfies constraint1.

Now, back in room1. Then need to proceed to room4 again to satisfy the goal. But how?

From room1, go to room2, then to room4 again. But need to have grey_ball_3 in room4. So:

26. gotoroom room1 room2 red_door_1
27. gotoroom room2 room4 purple_door_1
28. Now in room4. Need to be in front of grey_ball_3. So:

29. gotoobject grey_ball_3 room4
    - Now in front of it. This satisfies the goal.

But also, constraint12 requires being in front of grey_ball_3, which is done here. Constraint13 says that if I'm in front of grey_ball_3, then earlier I held some object. Which I did when carrying blue_box_1 (step20) and grey_ball_1 (step6). So that's satisfied.

Constraint7: If purple_door_1 is locked in a state, then I must be holding grey_ball_3 at that state or after. Currently, purple_door_1 was unlocked in step14. But constraint6 requires that purple_door_1 is locked in some state. So need to lock it again. Let's see:

After step14, purple_door_1 is unlocked. To lock it again, need to toggle it again. So:

After step14, perhaps:

14. toggle purple_door_1 (unlocks it)
15. (after using it to go to room4, then come back, lock it again?)

Wait, but in the plan above, after unlocking purple_door_1 (step14), we use it to go to room4 (step15). Then later steps involve moving back and forth. But to lock it again, we need to be in front of it again. So perhaps after dropping blue_box_1 in room4 (step22), we need to go back to room2, gotodoor purple_door_1, toggle it again to lock. Then, when we lock it (satisfies constraint6), at that state or after, we need to be holding grey_ball_3. But grey_ball_3 is in room4. So after locking purple_door_1, how do we get to room4 again? Because locking it would require it to be unlocked again? Or maybe use another door.

Alternatively, maybe we need to lock purple_door_1 after using it, and then unlock it again if needed. Let's adjust.

After step22: blue_box_1 is in room4. Then:

23. gotoroom room4 room2 purple_door_1 (back to room2)
24. gotodoor purple_door_1 room2 room4
25. toggle purple_door_1 (locks it) → satisfies constraint6
    - Now, in this state, purple_door_1 is locked. According to constraint7, in this state or after, I must be holding grey_ball_3. But grey_ball_3 is in room4. So after locking the door, I can't get back to room4 unless I unlock it again. But perhaps after locking it, I go to room4 via another door, like grey_door_1 from room3. But that would require unlocking grey_door_1.

This is getting complicated. Let's see:

After step25 (locking purple_door_1), I need to get to room4 again. To do that, I need to go through room3 via grey_door_1. So:

26. gotoroom room2 room1 red_door_1 (back to room1)
27. gotoroom room1 room3 green_door_1 (to room3)
28. gotodoor grey_door_1 room3 room4 (assuming it's unlocked from earlier steps? If not, need to unlock it. Earlier steps may have unlocked it in step14 (if grey_door_1 was unlocked when we went to room4 via grey_door_1). Wait, no, in the previous plan steps, we went to room4 via purple_door_1, so grey_door_1 might still be locked. So need to unlock grey_door_1.

So:

28. gotodoor grey_door_1 room3 room4
29. toggle grey_door_1 (unlocks it)
30. gotoroom room3 room4 grey_door_1 (now in room4)
31. gotoobject grey_ball_3 room4 (now in front of it)
    - This satisfies the goal.

But now, after locking purple_door_1 (step25), I need to have grey_ball_3 in hand or later. So in step31, I'm in front of grey_ball_3. To satisfy constraint7, after step25, I need to hold grey_ball_3 at some point. So perhaps pick it up:

32. pick grey_ball_3 room4 (now holding it)
    - Now, in state after step25 (locking purple_door_1), I am holding grey_ball_3 in step32. So constraint7 is satisfied.

But then I need to drop it again to satisfy the goal of being in front of it. So:

33. drop grey_ball_3 room4 (now in front of it)
    - But now, the goal is to be in room4 in front of a grey ball. Since grey_ball_3 was already there, but now I dropped it again. Wait, but dropping it would place it in room4 again, but I'm in front of it. So the goal is satisfied.

But this is getting too long. Let's try to streamline.

Alternative approach:

1. Unlock red_door_1 to get to room1, pick grey_ball_1.
2. Unlock green_door_1 to go to room3, get in front of purple_ball_1.
3. Return to room2, unlock purple_door_1 (satisfy constraint3 by step2).
4. Go to room4 via purple_door_1, drop grey_ball_1, then go back to room2, pick blue_box_1, take it to room4.
5. Then go back to room1 to satisfy constraint1.
6. Then return to room4 via purple_door_1 (if unlocked) or via grey_door_1 if needed.
7. Lock purple_door_1 after moving blue_box_1, then hold grey_ball_3.

But each step has to be checked for preconditions and effects.

Let's outline the plan step-by-step, ensuring all constraints are met:

Initial state: room_2, holding nothing.

Actions:

1. gotoempty room2 → to have no object in front.
2. gotodoor red_door_1 room2 room1 → go to red door.
3. toggle red_door_1 → unlock it.
4. gotoroom room2 room1 red_door_1 → enter room1.
5. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room1 → go to grey_ball_1.
6. pick grey_ball_1 room1 → now holding it (satisfies constraint10).
7. gotodoor green_door_1 room1 room3 → go to green door.
8. toggle green_door_1 → unlock it (now green_door_1 is unlocked, which is needed for constraint5).
9. gotoroom room1 room3 green_door_1 → enter room3.
10. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room3 → in front of it (satisfies constraint3's condition for when purple_door_1 is unlocked later).
11. gotoempty room3 → move away.
12. gotodoor grey_door_1 room3 room4 → go to grey door.
13. toggle grey_door_1 → unlock it.
14. gotoroom room3 room4 grey_door_1 → enter room4 (now in room4, satisfies constraint4).
   - But constraint5 says when in room4, there must have been a state where I held grey_ball_1 and green_door_1 was unlocked. Steps 6 (holding) and step8 (unlocked) satisfy that.
15. drop grey_ball_1 room4 → now in front of it. But goal requires being in front of grey_ball_3. So need to go to grey_ball_3.
16. gotoobject grey_ball_3 room4 → now in front of it (satisfies constraint12).
   - Also, constraint13: since I was holding grey_ball_1 earlier (step6), which is some object, this is satisfied.
17. Now, need to move blue_box_1 to room4 and be in room1. So return to room2.

17. gotoroom room4 room3 grey_door_1 → back to room3.
18. gotoroom room3 room1 green_door_1 → back to room1.
19. gotoroom room1 room2 red_door_1 → back to room2.
20. gotoobject blue_box_1 room2 → go to blue box.
21. pick blue_box_1 room2 → now holding it.
22. gotodoor purple_door_1 room2 room4 → go to purple door.
23. toggle purple_door_1 → unlock it (now satisfies constraint2).
   - Earlier step10 was in front of purple_ball_1, so constraint3 is satisfied.
24. gotoroom room2 room4 purple_door_1 → enter room4.
25. drop blue_box_1 room4 → now blue_box_1 is in room4 (satisfies part of constraint1).
26. gotoempty room4 → move away.
27. gotoroom room4 room2 purple_door_1 → back to room2.
28. toggle purple_door_1 → lock it (satisfies constraint6).
   - Now, after this step, constraint7 requires that in this state or after, I'm holding grey_ball_3. So need to go get grey_ball_3.
29. gotoroom room2 room1 red_door_1 → back to room1 (now in room1, while blue_box_1 is in room4 → satisfies constraint1).
30. Now, need to get back to room4 and in front of grey_ball_3. From room1, go through room3 and grey_door_1.
30. gotoroom room1 room3 green_door_1 → to room3.
31. gotoroom room3 room4 grey_door_1 → to room4.
32. gotoobject grey_ball_3 room4 → in front of it (satisfies goal).
   - Also, constraint12: in front of grey_ball_3. And constraint13: held objects earlier (steps6,21).

Other constraints:

- constraint8: be in room2 at some state. Steps0 (initial), 2,3,4,19,20, etc. Satisfied.
- constraint9: if in room2 in a state, later be in front of purple_ball_1. In step19, we are in room2. Later in step10, we were in front of purple_ball_1. So yes.
- constraint11: at some state, either grey_door_1 is unlocked or in front of purple_ball_1. Step13 unlocks grey_door_1, so yes.
- constraint4: in room4. Steps14,24, etc.

Also, constraint7: when purple_door_1 is locked (step28), need to be holding grey_ball_3 after. So after step28, we go to room4, pick grey_ball_3. But in current plan, step32 is just going in front of it. So perhaps need to pick it up after step32.

Wait, after step32, in front of grey_ball_3. Then:

33. pick grey_ball_3 room4 → now holding it (satisfies constraint7, since after step28 (locking purple_door_1), we hold grey_ball_3 in step33).

But then the goal requires being in front of it. So after picking it up, need to drop it again.

34. drop grey_ball_3 room4 → now in front of it.

But this adds steps. However, the problem requires an optimal plan (shortest possible). Let's see if this can be optimized.

Wait, maybe after step28 (locking purple_door_1), we need to go to room4 via grey_door_1 (already unlocked), pick grey_ball_3, then drop it. But maybe that's necessary to satisfy constraint7.

But this is getting very long. Let's verify all constraints:

1. blue_box_1 in room4 and me in room1 → step29 (in room1, blue_box_1 in room4).
2. purple_door_1 unlocked in step23 → satisfied.
3. when unlocking purple_door_1 (step23), earlier step10 was in front of purple_ball_1 → yes.
4. be in room4 → steps14,24,31.
5. when in room4, earlier held grey_ball_1 and green_door_1 was unlocked → steps6 and8.
6. purple_door_1 locked in step28 → yes.
7. after step28 (locked), need to hold grey_ball_3 at or after. If in step33 we pick it, yes.
8. be in room2 → yes, multiple times.
9. when in room2 (step19), later step10 in front of purple_ball_1 → yes.
10. holding some object → steps6,21,33.
11. grey_door_1 unlocked in step13 → yes.
12. in front of grey_ball_3 → step32.
13. when in front of grey_ball_3 (step32), earlier held objects → steps6,21,33.

This seems to satisfy all constraints. Now, the plan steps would be:

But this is very long. Let's count the steps. Is there a way to shorten it?

Alternative plan optimizing steps:

1. Unlock red_door_1, go to room1, pick grey_ball_1.
2. Unlock green_door_1, go to room3, be in front of purple_ball_1.
3. Return to room2, unlock purple_door_1 (using the earlier step10 to satisfy constraint3).
4. Go to room4, drop grey_ball_1.
5. Return to room2, pick blue_box_1, take to room4.
6. Return to room1 (satisfy constraint1).
7. Lock purple_door_1, then go to room4 via grey_door_1.
8. Pick grey_ball_3 to satisfy constraint7, then drop it.

But need to check if this is shorter.

Let's try to outline:

1. gotoempty (room2)
2. gotodoor red_door_1 room2 room1
3. toggle red_door_1
4. gotoroom room2 room1 red_door_1
5. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room1
6. pick grey_ball_1 room1
7. gotodoor green_door_1 room1 room3
8. toggle green_door_1
9. gotoroom room1 room3 green_door_1
10. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room3 (satisfy constraint3)
11. gotoempty room3
12. gotodoor grey_door_1 room3 room4
13. toggle grey_door_1
14. gotoroom room3 room4 grey_door_1 (in room4)
15. drop grey_ball_1 room4
16. gotoobject grey_ball_3 room4 (goal satisfied?)
17. But need to move blue_box_1 to room4 and be in room1.

But this skips handling blue_box_1 and purple_door_1 unlocking. So perhaps not. It's a trade-off between using grey_door_1 or purple_door_1.

But the constraints require that purple_door_1 must be both unlocked and locked at some states. So we have to include steps for that.

Final plan:

```
gotoempty
gotodoor red_door_1 room2 room1
toggle red_door_1
gotoroom room2 room1 red_door_1
gotoobject grey_ball_1 room1
pick grey_ball_1 room1
gotodoor green_door_1 room1 room3
toggle green_door_1
gotoroom room1 room3 green_door_1
gotoobject purple_ball_1 room3
gotoempty room3
gotodoor purple_door_1 room3 room2? No, purple_door_1 connects room2 and room4. So in room3, can't access purple_door_1. So need to go back to room2.

gotoroom room3 room1 green_door_1
gotoroom room1 room2 red_door_1
gotodoor purple_door_1 room2 room4
toggle purple_door_1
gotoroom room2 room4 purple_door_1
drop grey_ball_1 room4
gotoempty room4
gotoroom room4 room2 purple_door_1
gotoobject blue_box_1 room2
pick blue_box_1 room2
gotodoor purple_door_1 room2 room4
toggle purple_door_1
gotoroom room2 room4 purple_door_1
drop blue_box_1 room4
gotoempty room4
gotoroom room4 room2 purple_door_1
toggle purple_door_1
gotoroom room2 room1 red_door_1
gotoroom room1 room3 green_door_1
gotodoor grey_door_1 room3 room4
toggle grey_door_1
gotoroom room3 room4 grey_door_1
gotoobject grey_ball_3 room4
pick grey_ball_3 room4
drop grey_ball_3 room4
```

But this is very long. Perhaps there's a shorter path. Let's see if we can combine steps.

Wait, after step14 (in room4 via grey_door_1), we can drop grey_ball_1, then take blue_box_1 via purple_door_1. Let's try:

1. gotoempty room2
2. gotodoor red_door_1 room2 room1
3. toggle red_door_1
4. gotoroom room2 room1 red_door_1
5. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room1
6. pick grey_ball_1 room1
7. gotodoor green_door_1 room1 room3
8. toggle green_door_1
9. gotoroom room1 room3 green_door_1
10. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room3 (satisfy constraint3)
11. gotodoor grey_door_1 room3 room4
12. toggle grey_door_1
13. gotoroom room3 room4 grey_door_1 (now in room4)
14. drop grey_ball_1 room4
15. gotoempty room4
16. gotoroom room4 room3 grey_door_1
17. gotoroom room3 room1 green_door_1
18. gotoroom room1 room2 red_door_1
19. gotoobject blue_box_1 room2
20. pick blue_box_1 room2
21. gotodoor purple_door_1 room2 room4
22. toggle purple_door_1 (unlock)
23. gotoroom room2 room4 purple_door_1
24. drop blue_box_1 room4
25. gotoempty room4
26. gotoroom room4 room2 purple_door_1
27. toggle purple_door_1 (lock) → satisfies constraint6
28. gotoroom room2 room1 red_door_1 (now in room1 with blue_box_1 in room4 → constraint1)
29. gotoroom room1 room3 green_door_1
30. gotodoor grey_door_1 room3 room4
31. toggle grey_door_1 (unlock if needed)
32. gotoroom room3 room4 grey_door_1
33. gotoobject grey_ball_3 room4
34. pick grey_ball_3 room4 (satisfies constraint7)
35. drop grey_ball_3 room4 (now in front of it)

This way, all constraints are met. But the plan is quite long, but I think this is the minimal steps considering all constraints. However, I might have missed some shortcuts. For example, after step24 (blue_box_1 in room4), maybe go back to room1 directly from room4 via grey_door_1 and room3:

24. drop blue_box_1 room4
25. gotoroom room4 room3 grey_door_1
26. gotoroom room3 room1 green_door_1 (now in room1, which satisfies constraint1)
27. Then proceed to go back to room4.

But this saves some steps. Let's try:

1. gotoempty
2. gotodoor red_door_1 room2 room1
3. toggle red_door_1
4. gotoroom room2 room1 red_door_1
5. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room1
6. pick grey_ball_1 room1
7. gotodoor green_door_1 room1 room3
8. toggle green_door_1
9. gotoroom room1 room3 green_door_1
10. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room3
11. gotodoor grey_door_1 room3 room4
12. toggle grey_door_1
13. gotoroom room3 room4 grey_door_1
14. drop grey_ball_1 room4
15. gotoroom room4 room3 grey_door_1
16. gotoroom room3 room1 green_door_1
17. gotoroom room1 room2 red_door_1
18. gotoobject blue_box_1 room2
19. pick blue_box_1 room2
20. gotodoor purple_door_1 room2 room4
21. toggle purple_door_1
22. gotoroom room2 room4 purple_door_1
23. drop blue_box_1 room4
24. gotoroom room4 room2 purple_door_1
25. toggle purple_door_1 (lock)
26. gotoroom room2 room1 red_door_1 (now in room1, constraint1 satisfied)
27. gotoroom room1 room3 green_door_1
28. gotodoor grey_door_1 room3 room4
29. toggle grey_door_1
30. gotoroom room3 room4 grey_door_1
31. gotoobject grey_ball_3 room4
32. pick grey_ball_3 room4
33. drop grey_ball_3 room4

This plan has 33 steps. But perhaps there's redundancy. For example, after step23 (drop blue_box_1), we can go directly to room1 via grey_door_1 and green_door_1, instead of via room2.

Let me adjust:

After step23 (drop blue_box_1 in room4):

24. gotoroom room4 room3 grey_door_1
25. gotoroom room3 room1 green_door_1 (now in room1, which satisfies constraint1: blue_box_1 in room4 and me in room1)
26. Then proceed to go back to room4 to reach the goal.

26. gotoroom room1 room3 green_door_1
27. gotoroom room3 room4 grey_door_1
28. gotoobject grey_ball_3 room4
29. pick grey_ball_3 room4
30. drop grey_ball_3 room4

But now, after step25 (locking purple_door_1), we need to lock it and then hold grey_ball_3. Wait, in this plan, when do we lock purple_door_1? Oh, in the previous steps, step25 was to lock it. Wait, in the adjusted steps, after dropping blue_box_1 (step23), we go back to room3 and room1, then to room4. But purple_door_1 was unlocked in step21. To satisfy constraint6 (purple_door_1 must be locked at some state), we need to lock it. So after step21 (unlocking purple_door_1), we need to lock it again. So after step23:

24. gotoroom room4 room2 purple_door_1
25. toggle purple_door_1 (lock)
26. gotoroom room2 room1 red_door_1 (now in room1, satisfying constraint1)
27. ... proceed to room4 via grey_door_1.

This adds steps but ensures purple_door_1 is locked. So perhaps the initial plan is necessary.

Given the complexity, I think the first plan I outlined with all steps is necessary to meet all constraints. But let's try to present a concise version.
