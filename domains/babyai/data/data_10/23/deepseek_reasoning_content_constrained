Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. The goal is to end up in front of a yellow ball. The initial state has me in room_1 with a yellow_ball_1 there. But there are a bunch of constraints I need to satisfy along the way. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the constraints. I need to make sure that during the plan, each of these conditions is met at least once. Let me list them out:

1. Be in front of green_ball_2 in room_2.
2. Be holding some object.
3. Hold either green_ball_2 or grey_box_1.
4. Be in front of red_door_2.
5. Have yellow_door_1 unlocked and be in front of grey_ball_1.
6. Either hold grey_box_1 or have purple_door_1 unlocked.
7. Be in front of grey_ball_1.
8. Be in room_3 or have yellow_door_1 unlocked.
9. Hold grey_ball_1.
10. Be holding grey_box_1 or be in room_4.

Hmm, some of these might overlap. Let's see. The goal is a yellow ball. The initial yellow_ball_1 is in room_1. But maybe I need to go through other rooms to satisfy constraints. Let's check where the other yellow ball is: yellow_ball_2 is in room_4. So maybe the final goal could be either yellow_ball_1 or yellow_ball_2. But the problem says "a ball v such that v is yellow". So either is acceptable. But since I'm starting in room_1 with yellow_ball_1, maybe that's the easiest. But wait, let's check the constraints. For example, constraint 1 requires being in front of green_ball_2 in room_2. Green_ball_2 is in room_4. To get to room_4, I might need to go through room_2 or room_3. Let's see the doors. The doors are:

- yellow_door_1 connects room_1 and room_2 (but it's locked initially).
- red_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3 (locked).
- purple_door_1 connects room_2 and room_4 (locked).
- red_door_2 connects room_3 and room_4 (locked).

So all doors are locked initially. So I need to unlock some doors. But to toggle a door, I need to be in front of it. So first, I need to go to a door, then toggle it. But doors are locked, so initially, I can't go through them unless I unlock them first.

Starting in room_1. The yellow_door_1 connects to room_2. To get to room_2, I need to unlock yellow_door_1. But to toggle it, I need to be in front of it. So first, go to yellow_door_1 in room_1, then toggle it. Then I can go to room_2. Similarly, red_door_1 connects to room_3, but it's locked. So maybe I need to unlock that too.

But let's look at the constraints. Let's see which constraints can be satisfied in which rooms. For example, constraint 5 requires yellow_door_1 to be unlocked and being in front of grey_ball_1. Grey_ball_1 is in room_3. So to get to grey_ball_1, I need to go to room_3, which requires unlocking red_door_1. But red_door_1 is in room_1. So maybe first, unlock yellow_door_1, go to room_2, then go to room_4 via purple_door_1 (but that's locked). Wait, but maybe another path. Let's think.

Alternatively, perhaps the plan involves unlocking multiple doors. Let's see the steps needed:

1. To toggle a door, I need to be in front of it. So first, I need to go to the door in the current room.

For example, in room_1, I can go to yellow_door_1 (which connects to room_2) or red_door_1 (connects to room_3). Let's start with yellow_door_1.

So:

Action: gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2 (but wait, the 'gotodoor' action requires that the current room is one of the connected rooms. Since I'm in room_1, yes. So 'gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2' would position me in front of it. Then toggle it.

But wait, the 'gotodoor' preconditions: (i) you are in a room connected by d, and (ii) no object is blocking the position in front of d in the current room. Are there any objects blocking doors in room_1? The initial state lists yellow_ball_1 in room_1. If the ball is in front of the door, it would block. But the problem says that objects can block doors. Wait, in the effects of 'pick', if x was blocking a door, then it's no longer blocking. So the initial state doesn't mention any objects blocking doors. So perhaps the doors are not blocked by any objects. Therefore, I can go to the doors.

So step by step:

1. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2 (now in front of yellow_door_1)
2. toggle yellow_door_1 (unlocks it)
3. gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1 (now in room_2)

This allows me to get to room_2. Now, in room_2, I need to satisfy constraint 1: be in front of green_ball_2 in room_2. But green_ball_2 is in room_4. So I can't satisfy that yet. To get to room_4 from room_2, need to go through purple_door_1. But that's locked. So I need to unlock it. But to unlock it, I need to be in front of it. So in room_2, go to purple_door_1 (connects room_2 and room_4), toggle it. Then go to room_4.

But maybe there's another way. Let's see. The constraints require:

- At some point, be in room_4 or holding grey_box_1 (constraint 10). Grey_box_1 is in room_3. So if I can get to room_3, maybe pick it up. But room_3 is connected to room_1 via red_door_1, which is locked. So perhaps I need to unlock red_door_1.

Alternatively, from room_2, if I can get to room_4, then I can access green_ball_2. Let's see. Let's try to proceed to room_4.

From room_2:

4. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_4
5. toggle purple_door_1 (unlocks it)
6. gotoroom room_2 room_4 purple_door_1 (now in room_4)

In room_4, green_ball_2 is there. So:

7. gotoobject green_ball_2 room_4
8. pick green_ball_2 room_4 (now holding it, which satisfies constraint 2 (holding something) and part of constraint 3 (holding green_ball_2). Also, being in room_4 satisfies constraint 10 (if not holding grey_box_1, but we are in room_4, so that's okay).

But wait, constraint 1 requires being in front of green_ball_2 in room_2. But green_ball_2 is in room_4. So how can that be? Unless I have to move it to room_2. Wait, but the initial state says green_ball_2 is in room_4. So to satisfy constraint 1, I need to be in front of green_ball_2 in room_2. That implies that green_ball_2 must be moved to room_2. So I need to pick it up in room_4, then carry it to room_2 and drop it there. But that might complicate things. Let's check.

Wait, the problem says the final goal is to have a yellow ball in front of me. But the constraints require that at some point, I'm in front of green_ball_2 in room_2. So maybe I need to move green_ball_2 to room_2. But how?

Alternatively, maybe the initial statement has a typo. Wait, no. Let me recheck the initial state. The user says:

"green_ball_2 is in room_4"

So to be in front of green_ball_2 in room_2, that ball must be moved to room_2. Therefore, I need to carry green_ball_2 from room_4 to room_2. Which requires:

- Go to room_4 (which we can do via room_2 and purple_door_1 once unlocked)
- Pick up green_ball_2 in room_4
- Bring it back to room_2 via purple_door_1
- Drop it in room_2.

Then, in that state, I can be in front of green_ball_2 in room_2. But that's a lot of steps. Let's see if this is necessary.

But maybe there's another way. Let's check all constraints again. Let's list all constraints:

1. In front of green_ball_2 in room_2 (so green_ball_2 must be in room_2 when this happens)
2. Holding some object (easy, pick any object)
3. Holding green_ball_2 or grey_box_1 (so if I pick green_ball_2, that's covered)
4. In front of red_door_2 (which connects room_3 and room_4; so must be in either room_3 or room_4, in front of that door)
5. yellow_door_1 unlocked and in front of grey_ball_1 (grey_ball_1 is in room_3; so need to be in room_3 and in front of it, and yellow_door_1 must be unlocked)
6. Hold grey_box_1 or purple_door_1 unlocked (if I unlock purple_door_1, then this is satisfied)
7. In front of grey_ball_1 (so need to be in room_3)
8. In room_3 or yellow_door_1 unlocked (if I unlock yellow_door_1, which I already did in step 2, then this is satisfied in any state after that)
9. Holding grey_ball_1 (so pick it up in room_3)
10. Hold grey_box_1 or be in room_4 (if I go to room_4, that's covered)

So to satisfy constraint 1, I need to have green_ball_2 in room_2. Therefore, I must carry it there.

So steps after getting to room_4:

7. gotoobject green_ball_2 room_4
8. pick green_ball_2 room_4 (now holding it; satisfies constraints 2, 3)
9. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_2 (wait, no. The door connects room_2 and room_4. So from room_4, to go back to room_2, I need to use purple_door_1. So:

9. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_2 (but the door is already unlocked from earlier)
10. gotoroom room_4 room_2 purple_door_1 (now in room_2)
11. drop green_ball_2 room_2 (now it's in room_2; then gotoobject green_ball_2 room_2 to satisfy constraint 1)

But wait, after dropping it, I'm in front of it. So maybe:

11. drop green_ball_2 room_2 (now in front of it in room_2; this action would leave me in front of green_ball_2 in room_2. So that action's effect is (ii) you are in front of x. So after dropping, I'm in front of green_ball_2. So that state would satisfy constraint 1. So step 11 is the drop action, which would satisfy constraint 1.

So that's handled. Then, moving on.

But then, we need to handle other constraints. For example, constraint 4: in front of red_door_2. red_door_2 connects room_3 and room_4. To be in front of it, I need to be in either room_3 or room_4 and go to that door. Let's see. Suppose after handling green_ball_2, we need to go to room_3 or room_4 to reach red_door_2.

But let's see: after dropping green_ball_2 in room_2, I'm in room_2. To get to red_door_2, which is in room_3 or room_4. Let's think. From room_2, if I go back to room_4 via purple_door_1, then in room_4, red_door_2 connects to room_3. So in room_4, I can go to red_door_2:

But wait, in room_4, the doors are purple_door_1 (to room_2) and red_door_2 (to room_3). So to get to red_door_2 from room_4:

12. gotodoor red_door_2 room_4 room_3 (now in front of red_door_2 in room_4; that satisfies constraint 4)

Then, perhaps toggle it to unlock, but not necessary unless needed for movement. But the constraint just requires being in front of it once.

So step 12: gotodoor red_door_2 room_4 room_3 → satisfies constraint 4.

But then, after that, maybe proceed to room_3. Because in room_3, there's grey_ball_1 and grey_box_1, which are needed for other constraints.

To get to room_3 from room_4, need to go through red_door_2. But red_door_2 is locked initially. So need to unlock it. So after step 12:

13. toggle red_door_2 (unlocks it)
14. gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_2 (now in room_3)

In room_3, there's grey_ball_1, grey_box_1, etc. So:

15. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_3 (satisfies constraint 7)
16. pick grey_ball_1 room_3 (satisfies constraint 9)
17. Then, need to handle constraint 5: yellow_door_1 unlocked (which it is) and in front of grey_ball_1. Wait, but after picking grey_ball_1, it's no longer in the room. So this constraint must be satisfied before picking it. Wait, constraint 5 requires that in some state, yellow_door_1 is unlocked and I'm in front of grey_ball_1. So step 15 (gotoobject grey_ball_1) would have me in front of it, and yellow_door_1 was unlocked in step 2. So that state (after step 15) satisfies constraint 5.

Then, after picking grey_ball_1 (step 16), I'm holding it, which satisfies constraint 9. Then, maybe drop it later if needed, but the goal is to have a yellow ball in front. So perhaps after handling all constraints, proceed to get a yellow ball.

But the yellow_ball_1 is in room_1. To get back to room_1, need to go through red_door_1 (from room_3 to room_1), but red_door_1 is locked. So need to unlock it.

So from room_3:

18. gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1 (since I'm in room_3, this door connects to room_1)
19. toggle red_door_1 (unlock it)
20. gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1 (now back in room_1)

Now, in room_1, yellow_ball_1 is here. So:

21. gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_1 (now in front of it, which is the goal)

But wait, the goal is to be in front of a yellow ball. So this action would achieve the goal.

But need to check all constraints. Let's verify each constraint:

1. At some point, in front of green_ball_2 in room_2 → achieved when dropping it in room_2 (step 11)
2. Holding some object → when holding green_ball_2 (steps 8-10, 16)
3. Holding green_ball_2 or grey_box_1 → held green_ball_2 (step 8)
4. In front of red_door_2 → step 12
5. yellow_door_1 unlocked and in front of grey_ball_1 → step 15 (in front of grey_ball_1) and yellow_door_1 was unlocked in step 2
6. Hold grey_box_1 or purple_door_1 unlocked → purple_door_1 was unlocked in step 5, so yes
7. In front of grey_ball_1 → step 15
8. In room_3 or yellow_door_1 unlocked → yes, since we were in room_3 (steps 14-20), and yellow_door_1 is unlocked
9. Holding grey_ball_1 → step 16
10. Hold grey_box_1 or in room_4 → we were in room_4 (steps 6-12, and maybe others)

Wait, but in step 10, after going to room_2, then to room_4, then back to room_2, then to room_4 again? Let me retrace:

Wait, initial steps:

1. Unlock yellow_door_1, go to room_2 (steps 1-3)
2. Unlock purple_door_1, go to room_4 (steps 4-6)
3. Pick green_ball_2 (7-8)
4. Go back to room_2 (9-10)
5. Drop green_ball_2 in room_2 (11)
6. Go to red_door_2 in room_4 (steps 12 requires being in room_4 again? Wait, after step 11, we are in room_2. To get to red_door_2 (which is in room_4 and room_3), need to go back to room_4. So from room_2:

12. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_4
13. gotoroom room_2 room_4 purple_door_1 (now in room_4)
14. gotodoor red_door_2 room_4 room_3 (now in front of red_door_2 → satisfies constraint 4)
15. toggle red_door_2 (unlock)
16. gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_2 (now in room_3)
17. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_3 (step 15 in original plan)
18. pick grey_ball_1 (step 16)
19. Then unlock red_door_1 to get back to room_1.

But this adds more steps. Let me adjust the earlier steps to account for needing to go back to room_4 after dropping green_ball_2.

Wait, maybe after dropping green_ball_2 in room_2 (step 11), I need to go to room_4 again to reach red_door_2. So:

11. drop green_ball_2 room_2 (now in room_2, in front of it)
12. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_4
13. gotoroom room_2 room_4 purple_door_1 (now in room_4)
14. gotodoor red_door_2 room_4 room_3 (now in front of red_door_2 → constraint 4 satisfied)
15. toggle red_door_2 (unlock)
16. gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_2 (now in room_3)
17. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_3 (constraint 7)
18. pick grey_ball_1 (constraint 9)
19. gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1
20. toggle red_door_1 (unlock)
21. gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1 (back to room_1)
22. gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_1 (achieve goal)

But then, what about constraint 8: in room_3 or yellow_door_1 unlocked. Since we were in room_3 (steps 16-21), that's satisfied. Also, yellow_door_1 was unlocked earlier.

Constraint 6: either hold grey_box_1 or purple_door_1 unlocked. Since purple_door_1 was unlocked in step 5, this is satisfied.

Constraint 10: hold grey_box_1 or be in room_4. We were in room_4 (steps 13-14), so that's covered.

Now, what about constraint 3: holding green_ball_2 or grey_box_1. We held green_ball_2 (steps 8-10), so that's covered.

But wait, in this adjusted plan, when do we hold grey_box_1? We don't. So if the plan doesn't require holding grey_box_1, but only satisfy constraint 3 by holding green_ball_2, then it's okay. Because constraint 3 says "at least one" of those, so holding green_ball_2 satisfies it.

Similarly, constraint 6 says either hold grey_box_1 or purple_door_1 unlocked. Since purple_door_1 was unlocked, that's satisfied.

So all constraints seem to be covered in this plan.

Let me check each constraint again with the steps:

1. In front of green_ball_2 in room_2 → step 11 (after drop)
2. Holding some object → steps 8, 16-18 (holding green_ball_2 and grey_ball_1)
3. Hold green_ball_2 or grey_box_1 → step 8 (green_ball_2)
4. In front of red_door_2 → step 14
5. yellow_door_1 unlocked and in front of grey_ball_1 → step 17 (goto grey_ball_1 in room_3) and yellow_door_1 was unlocked in step 2
6. grey_box_1 or purple_door_1 unlocked → purple_door_1 unlocked in step 5
7. front of grey_ball_1 → step 17
8. in room_3 or yellow_door_1 unlocked → in room_3 steps 16-21
9. holding grey_ball_1 → step 18
10. grey_box_1 or room_4 → in room_4 steps 13-14

Yes, all constraints are met.

Now, the final step is to get in front of a yellow ball. The yellow_ball_1 is in room_1, so after returning to room_1 (step 21), gotoobject yellow_ball_1 (step 22) achieves the goal.

Now, let's count the steps to make sure it's optimal. Is there a shorter path?

Alternative approach: Instead of moving green_ball_2 to room_2, is there another way to satisfy constraint 1? No, because green_ball_2 starts in room_4, so to be in front of it in room_2, it must be moved there. So that's necessary.

But maybe there's a shorter path. For example, after unlocking yellow_door_1 and going to room_2, then unlocking purple_door_1 and going to room_4, pick green_ball_2, return to room_2, drop it. Then go to room_4 again to get to red_door_2, then to room_3, handle grey_ball_1, unlock red_door_1, return to room_1. That seems necessary.

Is there any redundant steps? For example, after dropping green_ball_2 in room_2, we go back to room_4 to reach red_door_2. Then proceed to room_3, etc. That seems necessary.

Alternatively, could we unlock red_door_2 from room_3? If we go to room_3 via red_door_1 (unlocking it first), then maybe go to red_door_2 from room_3. Let's explore that.

Alternative path:

1. In room_1, unlock red_door_1 (since grey_ball_1 is in room_3, which is needed for several constraints). Steps:

1. gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3
2. toggle red_door_1 (unlock)
3. gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1 (now in room_3)
4. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_3 (constraint 7)
5. pick grey_ball_1 (constraint 9)
6. drop grey_ball_1 (maybe not needed)
But then need to handle green_ball_2 in room_2, which requires going to room_2 and 4.

But this approach might complicate other constraints. For example, constraint 1 requires green_ball_2 in room_2. So we still need to move it there. So this path might require more steps.

So the initial plan seems optimal. Let's outline the steps again concisely:

1. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2
2. toggle yellow_door_1
3. gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1
4. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_4
5. toggle purple_door_1
6. gotoroom room_2 room_4 purple_door_1
7. gotoobject green_ball_2 room_4
8. pick green_ball_2 room_4
9. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_2
10. gotoroom room_4 room_2 purple_door_1
11. drop green_ball_2 room_2
12. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_4
13. gotoroom room_2 room_4 purple_door_1
14. gotodoor red_door_2 room_4 room_3
15. toggle red_door_2
16. gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_2
17. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_3
18. pick grey_ball_1 room_3
19. gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1
20. toggle red_door_1
21. gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1
22. gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_1

Now, checking for optimality: can any steps be merged or skipped?

For example, after step 11 (dropping green_ball_2 in room_2), steps 12-13 go back to room_4. Is there a way to avoid that?

Alternatively, after step 11, can we go directly to room_3 via another path? But from room_2, the doors are yellow_door_1 (to room_1) and purple_door_1 (to room_4). To get to room_3, need to go through room_1 via red_door_1 (unlocked?), but red_door_1 is initially locked. So unless we unlock it earlier, which we don't in this path.

So in this plan, unlocking red_door_1 happens after going to room_3 via red_door_2 from room_4.

Alternatively, after step 11 (in room_2), go back to room_1 via yellow_door_1 (already unlocked), then unlock red_door_1, go to room_3, etc. But that might add steps.

But in the current plan, after step 11, going back to room_4 to reach red_door_2 is necessary to satisfy constraint 4 (in front of red_door_2). Then proceed to room_3.

Alternatively, after step 11, go to room_1 and unlock red_door_1:

12. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_1
13. gotoroom room_2 room_1 yellow_door_1 (now in room_1)
14. gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3
15. toggle red_door_1
16. gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1 (now in room_3)
17. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_3
18. pick grey_ball_1
19. gotodoor red_door_2 room_3 room_4
20. toggle red_door_2 (but already unlocked in step 15? No, red_door_2 is a different door. Wait, red_door_2 connects room_3 and room_4. So in room_3, I can go to red_door_2.

20. gotodoor red_door_2 room_3 room_4
21. toggle red_door_2 (unlock)
22. gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_2 (now in room_4)
23. gotodoor red_door_2 room_4 room_3 (now in front of it, satisfying constraint 4)

But this approach would require more steps and may not be shorter.

The original plan seems to handle all constraints with fewer steps. Thus, it's likely the optimal path.
