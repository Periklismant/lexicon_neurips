```
gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_1
```
```

Wait, no. That's just the final action. The full plan needs to include all steps. Let me write the full plan with the steps outlined earlier.

But considering the initial plan steps, here's the correct sequence:

```
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2
toggle yellow_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_4
toggle purple_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_4 purple_door_1
gotoobject green_ball_2 room_4
pick green_ball_2 room_4
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_2
gotoroom room_4 room_2 purple_door_1
drop green_ball_2 room_2
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_4
gotoroom room_2 room_4 purple_door_1
gotodoor red_door_2 room_4 room_3
toggle red_door_2
gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_2
gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_3
pick grey_ball_1 room_3
gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1
toggle red_door_1
gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1
gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_1
```

But need to check if each step is correct. For example, after step 9: gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_2 (correct), then gotoroom room_4 room_2 purple_door_1 (correct). Then drop green_ball_2 room_2 (step 11). Then step 12: gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_4 (since in room_2, purple_door_1 connects to room_4). Then gotoroom room_2 room_4 purple_door_1 (step 13). Then step 14: gotodoor red_door_2 room_4 room_3. Then toggle (step15), etc.

This sequence includes all necessary steps to meet the constraints and achieve the goal. Each action is needed and the plan is optimal in length.

```
```
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2
toggle yellow_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_4
toggle purple_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_4 purple_door_1
gotoobject green_ball_2 room_4
pick green_ball_2 room_4
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_2
gotoroom room_4 room_2 purple_door_1
drop green_ball_2 room_2
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_4
gotoroom room_2 room_4 purple_door_1
gotodoor red_door_2 room_4 room_3
toggle red_door_2
gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_2
gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_3
pick grey_ball_1 room_3
gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1
toggle red_door_1
gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1
gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_1
