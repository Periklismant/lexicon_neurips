Okay, let's see. The goal is to have a yellow ball in front of me. The initial state is that I'm in room_1, and there's a yellow_ball_1 in room_1. But wait, the yellow_ball_1 is in room_1, right? So maybe I can just go to it and pick it up? But wait, the goal is to be in front of a yellow ball, not necessarily holding it. Hmm. Wait, the goal says "there is a ball v such that v is yellow and you are in front of v". So I just need to be in front of any yellow ball. Since yellow_ball_1 is in room_1, maybe I can just go to it. Let me check the initial state again.

In room_1, yellow_ball_1 is present. So the initial plan might be as simple as "gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_1". But wait, the preconditions for gotoobject require that I'm in the same room as the object. Since I start in room_1, that's possible. So the action would be "gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_1". Then I'm in front of it, which satisfies the goal. But why is the problem presented as needing a plan? Maybe there are constraints or doors locked that prevent this?

Wait, let's check the constraints. The problem mentions that the valid plan must abide by constraints, but the user hasn't listed any specific constraints here. Wait, looking back, the user included the problem statement. Wait, under the original problem, the user says "the task is to bring about the following situation...", and the constraints are probably part of the problem. Wait, the user might have intended to include constraints but maybe they got cut off? Let me check again.

Wait, looking at the original problem statement provided by the user: The final part says "A valid plan for the abovementioned problem must abide by the following constraints:" but there's nothing after that. Hmm. That's odd. Maybe the user made a mistake in the input. But given that, perhaps the only constraints are the ones inherent in the problem's actions and initial state. So, perhaps there's a missing part here, but given the information, I have to work with what's provided.

Wait, the initial state shows that all doors are locked. The yellow_door_1 (connecting room_1 and room_2), red_door_1 (connecting room_1 and room_3), purple_door_1 (connecting room_2 and room_4), and red_door_2 (connecting room_3 and room_4) are all locked. So, if I start in room_1, but all doors are locked, can I move to other rooms? Let's see. The only way to move between rooms is through doors, but they're all locked. So unless I can unlock them, I can't move. The 'toggle' action can unlock a door if I'm in front of it. But to get in front of a door, I need to be in a room connected by that door. For example, yellow_door_1 connects room_1 and room_2. To go to the door, I need to be in room_1 or room_2, but since I'm in room_1, I can go to yellow_door_1 from room_1. But wait, the preconditions for "gotodoor d r1 r2" require that (i) you're in a room connected by d, and (ii) there's no object blocking the position in front of d in the current room. Are there any objects blocking doors in the initial state? Let's check the initial objects. The objects in room_1 are yellow_ball_1. The other objects are in room_3 and room_4. So, in room_1, the yellow_ball_1 is present, but is it blocking the door? The problem says that objects block doors if they are in front of them. Wait, the effect of "drop" says that if the object was blocking a door, then it's no longer blocking. So perhaps when an object is placed in front of a door, it blocks it. But in the initial state, are any objects blocking doors? The initial positions: yellow_ball_1 is in room_1. If the doors in room_1 are red_door_1 (connecting to room_3) and yellow_door_1 (connecting to room_2). So unless the yellow_ball_1 is in front of one of those doors, it would block. But the initial state doesn't mention any objects blocking doors. The problem's initial state lists "you are in room_1", "yellow_ball_1 is in room_1", but not that it's blocking any door. So perhaps the doors in room_1 are not blocked by objects. Therefore, to go to yellow_door_1 from room_1, I can do "gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2", assuming there's no object blocking. Since yellow_ball_1 is in room_1 but not blocking the door, this action's precondition (ii) is satisfied.

So, steps could be:

1. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2 (since I'm in room_1, and the door connects room_1 and room_2, and no object is blocking it)
2. toggle yellow_door_1 (to unlock it)
3. gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1 (now the door is unlocked, so I can move to room_2)
Wait, but why would I need to go to room_2? Because the goal is to be in front of a yellow ball. The yellow_ball_1 is in room_1. So maybe the simplest plan is just to go to that ball. Let me check the initial state again. The yellow_ball_1 is in room_1. So if I can just gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_1, then that's the plan. But why are the doors all locked? Because in the initial state, the doors are locked. But if I'm in room_1 and the yellow_ball_1 is in room_1, perhaps the doors being locked don't affect me. So the plan could be:

1. gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_1.

But the preconditions for gotoobject are that I'm in the same room as the object. Since I start in room_1, that's true. Then, performing that action would put me in front of yellow_ball_1, which satisfies the goal. But why is the problem presented as needing a plan? Maybe there's a mistake here, or perhaps I'm missing something. Wait, the initial state says that I have visited room_1. So maybe the initial position is in front of nothing. Wait, the initial state doesn't mention being in front of anything. The 'gotoobject' action makes me in front of the object. So if I start in room_1, not in front of anything, then the first action is to go to the object. So the plan would just be that single action. But that seems too easy. Let me check the problem again.

Wait, the user might have intended to have the door locked and the ball in another room, but according to the given initial state, yellow_ball_1 is in room_1, and the agent is in room_1. So maybe the answer is simply to gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_1. However, let me check if there are any constraints that I'm missing. The user mentioned that the plan must satisfy all constraints, but the constraints section is empty. So perhaps there's a mistake in the input. If there are no constraints, then the optimal plan is just one action. But maybe the initial problem intended that the doors are locked, and the agent can't reach the ball without unlocking doors. Wait, no, because the agent is already in room_1 with the ball. So unless the ball is blocked by a locked door, which it's not. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the yellow_ball_1 is in room_1, but the agent can't reach it because the doors are locked. Wait, but the doors being locked only prevent moving between rooms, not moving within a room. So the agent can move within room_1 even if the doors are locked. So the plan would be straightforward. But perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me check again.

Original problem: The agent starts in room_1. The yellow_ball_1 is in room_1. All doors are locked. The goal is to be in front of a yellow ball. Since the ball is in the same room, the agent can just gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_1. That's a valid action. The preconditions are met: agent is in room_1, the object is in room_1, and not holding anything. So the action is possible. Then the effect is that the agent is in front of yellow_ball_1, which satisfies the goal. So the plan would be just that one action. But maybe there's a constraint not mentioned, like you can't have any doors locked when you achieve the goal? But the problem's constraints section is empty, so no. Therefore, the optimal plan is one action. But perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again.

Wait, the problem's initial state says "you are in room_1", but not in front of anything. So to be in front of the ball, the agent must perform the 'gotoobject' action. So the plan is simply:

Action: gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_1

Which brings the agent in front of the yellow_ball_1. Therefore, the goal is satisfied. All constraints are satisfied as there are no additional constraints mentioned. So that's the plan. But this seems too simple, so maybe there's a misunderstanding. Let me check the problem again.

Wait, the user provided the initial state, which includes that all doors are locked. But since the agent is already in room_1 with the yellow_ball_1, there's no need to go through any doors. So the answer is indeed that single action. Therefore, the optimal plan is one step.
