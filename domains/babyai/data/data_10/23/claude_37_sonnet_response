Let's analyze the problem. I am an agent in a gridworld with 4 rooms arranged in a square. The rooms are connected via doors, and each door, box and ball has a color. I need to provide a valid sequence of actions to solve the planning problem.

First, let's understand the initial state:
1. I am in room_1
2. yellow_ball_1 is in room_1
3. red_box_1, grey_box_1, blue_ball_1, grey_ball_1, green_ball_1 are in room_3
4. green_ball_2, yellow_ball_2 are in room_4
5. All doors (yellow_door_1, red_door_1, purple_door_1, red_door_2) are locked
6. I am not holding any object
7. I have visited room_1

The task is to be in front of a yellow ball.

Additionally, there are several constraints I must satisfy:
1. At some point, I need to be in front of green_ball_2 while in room_2
2. At some point, I need to be holding some object
3. At some point, I need to be holding either green_ball_2 or grey_box_1
4. At some point, I need to be in front of red_door_2
5. At some point, yellow_door_1 should be unlocked and I need to be in front of grey_ball_1
6. At some point, I need to either be holding grey_box_1 or purple_door_1 should be unlocked
7. At some point, I need to be in front of grey_ball_1
8. At some point, I need to either be in room_3 or yellow_door_1 should be unlocked
9. At some point, I need to be holding grey_ball_1
10. At some point, I need to either be holding grey_box_1 or be in room_4

Let me plan a valid sequence of actions to solve this problem.

First, I need to figure out the locations of the objects and doors. Based on the initial state, I know:
- yellow_ball_1 is in room_1
- red_box_1, grey_box_1, blue_ball_1, grey_ball_1, green_ball_1 are in room_3
- green_ball_2, yellow_ball_2 are in room_4

Looking at the task, I need to be in front of a yellow ball. There are two yellow balls in the world: yellow_ball_1 in room_1, and yellow_ball_2 in room_4. The easiest way to achieve the task is to go to yellow_ball_1 since I'm already in room_1.

But I need to satisfy the constraints. Let's think through them:

1. I need to be in front of green_ball_2, which is in room_4, while in room_2.
   - This is impossible since an object can't be in a different room than me.
   - Oh, I think it's saying I need to move green_ball_2 from room_4 to room_2, and then be in front of it in room_2.

2-10. These constraints involve me holding and being in front of various objects, being in certain rooms, and having certain doors unlocked.

Let's try to build a plan:

First, let's fulfill the task and be in front of a yellow ball:
1. I can use the "gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_1" action to go in front of yellow_ball_1 in room_1.

However, this doesn't satisfy most of the constraints.

Let's revisit this. I need to access other rooms:
- To get to room_2, I need to unlock yellow_door_1 (connecting room_1 and room_2)
- To get to room_3, I need to unlock red_door_1 (connecting room_1 and room_3)
- To get to room_4 from room_2, I need to unlock purple_door_1, or alternatively, from room_3, I need to unlock red_door_2

Constraint 8 says I need to be in room_3 or yellow_door_1 should be unlocked. Let's choose to unlock yellow_door_1 and go to room_3 (which will satisfy constraint 8).

So a partial plan could be:
1. gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_1 (to fulfill the task)
2. pick yellow_ball_1 room_1 (to satisfy constraint 2: hold some object)
3. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2
4. toggle yellow_door_1 (this unlocks yellow_door_1, satisfying part of constraint 8)
5. gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1 (now I'm in room_2)
6. drop yellow_ball_1 room_2 (this drops the yellow ball in room_2)

Now, I'm in room_2. From here, I can try to fulfill more constraints.

Constraint 1 says I need to be in front of green_ball_2 in room_2, but green_ball_2 is in room_4. I need to get it to room_2.

To do that, I need to go to room_4, pick up green_ball_2, and bring it back to room_2.

Let's add to our plan:
7. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_4
8. toggle purple_door_1 (this unlocks purple_door_1, satisfying part of constraint 6)
9. gotoroom room_2 room_4 purple_door_1 (now I'm in room_4, satisfying constraint 10)
10. gotoobject green_ball_2 room_4
11. pick green_ball_2 room_4 (this satisfies constraint 3: holding green_ball_2)
12. gotoobject yellow_ball_2 room_4 (this can satisfy the main task if needed)
13. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_2
14. gotoroom room_4 room_2 purple_door_1 (back to room_2)
15. drop green_ball_2 room_2
16. gotoobject green_ball_2 room_2 (this satisfies constraint 1: in front of green_ball_2 in room_2)

Now, I'm in room_2, and I've already satisfied several constraints. To continue, I need to go to room_3 to fulfill the remaining constraints.

Let's go back to room_1, and then to room_3:
17. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_1
18. gotoroom room_2 room_1 yellow_door_1 (back to room_1)
19. gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3
20. toggle red_door_1 (this unlocks red_door_1)
21. gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1 (now I'm in room_3, which satisfies part of constraint 8)

Now I'm in room_3. Constraints 4, 5, 7, and 9 require me to be in front of red_door_2, grey_ball_1, and to hold grey_ball_1.

22. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_3 (this satisfies constraint 7)
23. pick grey_ball_1 room_3 (this satisfies constraint 9)
24. gotodoor red_door_2 room_3 room_4 (this satisfies constraint 4)
25. toggle red_door_2 (this unlocks red_door_2)
26. gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_2 (back to room_4)
27. drop grey_ball_1 room_4
28. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_2
29. gotoroom room_4 room_2 purple_door_1 (back to room_2)
30. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_1
31. gotoroom room_2 room_1 yellow_door_1 (back to room_1)
32. gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3
33. gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1 (back to room_3)
34. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_3
35. pick grey_box_1 room_3 (this satisfies constraint 3 and part of constraint 6)
36. gotoobject red_door_2 room_3 room_4
37. gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_2 (back to room_4)
38. gotoobject yellow_ball_2 room_4
39. drop grey_box_1 room_4
40. gotoobject yellow_ball_2 room_4 (this satisfies the main task)

There's one more constraint to satisfy: constraint 5 requires yellow_door_1 to be unlocked and me to be in front of grey_ball_1.

However, there's a contradiction. grey_ball_1 was in room_3, but I moved it to room_4. And yellow_door_1 connects room_1 and room_2, not room_3 or room_4. I can't be in front of grey_ball_1 while yellow_door_1 is unlocked because they are in different parts of the gridworld.

Let me revisit this plan. I think I missed something or made an error.

Let's reconsider the constraints:
5. The following expression must hold in at least one state: "The following conditions are all true: 'yellow_door_1 is not locked', 'you are in front of grey_ball_1'"

This means that at some point, I need to be in front of grey_ball_1 (which is in room_3) and yellow_door_1 (which connects room_1 and room_2) should be unlocked. I can unlock yellow_door_1, then go to room_3 and be in front of grey_ball_1. The constraint doesn't say I need to be in the room with yellow_door_1, just that yellow_door_1 should be unlocked while I'm in front of grey_ball_1.

Let's rebuild the plan:

1. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2
2. toggle yellow_door_1 (this unlocks yellow_door_1, satisfying parts of constraints 5 and 8)
3. gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3
4. toggle red_door_1 (this unlocks red_door_1)
5. gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1 (now I'm in room_3, which satisfies part of constraint 8)
6. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_3 (this, combined with the fact that yellow_door_1 is unlocked, satisfies constraint 5 and 7)
7. pick grey_ball_1 room_3 (this satisfies constraint 9)
8. gotodoor red_door_2 room_3 room_4 (this satisfies constraint 4)
9. toggle red_door_2 (this unlocks red_door_2)
10. gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_2 (now I'm in room_4, satisfying constraint 10)
11. drop grey_ball_1 room_4
12. gotoobject green_ball_2 room_4
13. pick green_ball_2 room_4 (this satisfies constraint 3: holding green_ball_2, and constraint 2: holding some object)
14. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_2
15. toggle purple_door_1 (this unlocks purple_door_1, satisfying constraint 6)
16. gotoroom room_4 room_2 purple_door_1 (now I'm in room_2)
17. drop green_ball_2 room_2
18. gotoobject green_ball_2 room_2 (this satisfies constraint 1: in front of green_ball_2 in room_2)
19. gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_1 (to fulfill the task, I need to go back to room_1)
20. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_1
21. gotoroom room_2 room_1 yellow_door_1 (back to room_1)
22. gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_1 (this satisfies the main task)

Hold on, I've made an error again. According to the initial state, yellow_ball_1 is in room_1. But if I've been in room_1 the entire time and haven't moved yellow_ball_1, yellow_ball_1 should still be in room_1.

Let's revise the plan:

1. gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_1 (this could satisfy the main task, but it doesn't satisfy the constraints)
2. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2
3. toggle yellow_door_1 (this unlocks yellow_door_1, satisfying parts of constraints 5 and 8)
4. gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3
5. toggle red_door_1 (this unlocks red_door_1)
6. gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1 (now I'm in room_3, which satisfies part of constraint 8)
7. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_3 (this, combined with the fact that yellow_door_1 is unlocked, satisfies constraint 5 and 7)
8. pick grey_ball_1 room_3 (this satisfies constraint 9 and constraint 2: holding some object)
9. gotodoor red_door_2 room_3 room_4 (this satisfies constraint 4)
10. toggle red_door_2 (this unlocks red_door_2)
11. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_3
12. drop grey_ball_1 room_3
13. pick grey_box_1 room_3 (this satisfies constraint 3 and part of constraint 6)
14. gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_2 (now I'm in room_4, satisfying constraint 10)
15. drop grey_box_1 room_4
16. gotoobject green_ball_2 room_4
17. pick green_ball_2 room_4 (this satisfies constraint 3: holding green_ball_2)
18. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_2
19. toggle purple_door_1 (this unlocks purple_door_1, satisfying constraint 6)
20. gotoroom room_4 room_2 purple_door_1 (now I'm in room_2)
21. drop green_ball_2 room_2
22. gotoobject green_ball_2 room_2 (this satisfies constraint 1: in front of green_ball_2 in room_2)
23. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_1
24. gotoroom room_2 room_1 yellow_door_1 (back to room_1)
25. gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_1 (this satisfies the main task)

Okay, I've now satisfied all the constraints. Let's verify my solution is still valid by double-checking the preconditions of each action in my plan:

1. gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_1: Valid because I am in room_1 and yellow_ball_1 is in room_1.
2. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2: Valid because I am in room_1 and yellow_door_1 connects room_1 and room_2.
3. toggle yellow_door_1: Valid because I am in front of yellow_door_1.
4. gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3: Valid because I am in room_1 and red_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3.
5. toggle red_door_1: Valid because I am in front of red_door_1.
6. gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1: Valid because I am in room_1, red_door_1 is unlocked and connects room_1 and room_3.
7. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_3: Valid because I am in room_3 and grey_ball_1 is in room_3.
8. pick grey_ball_1 room_3: Valid because I am in room_3, I am in front of grey_ball_1, and my hands are empty.
9. gotodoor red_door_2 room_3 room_4: Valid because I am in room_3, red_door_2 connects room_3 and room_4, and I am holding grey_ball_1, so I can't be in front of an object in the room.
10. toggle red_door_2: Valid because I am in front of red_door_2.
11. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_3: Valid because I am in room_3 and grey_box_1 is in room_3.
12. drop grey_ball_1 room_3: Valid because I am in room_3, I am holding grey_ball_1, and the position in front of me (which is in front of grey_box_1) is occupied by grey_box_1, so I can't drop grey_ball_1 here.

Wait, I can't drop grey_ball_1 at step 12 because the position in front of me is not empty. I need to go to an empty position first.

Fixed plan:
1. gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_1 (this could satisfy the main task, but it doesn't satisfy the constraints)
2. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2
3. toggle yellow_door_1 (this unlocks yellow_door_1, satisfying parts of constraints 5 and 8)
4. gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3
5. toggle red_door_1 (this unlocks red_door_1)
6. gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1 (now I'm in room_3, which satisfies part of constraint 8)
7. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_3 (this, combined with the fact that yellow_door_1 is unlocked, satisfies constraint 5 and 7)
8. pick grey_ball_1 room_3 (this satisfies constraint 9 and constraint 2: holding some object)
9. gotodoor red_door_2 room_3 room_4 (this satisfies constraint 4)
10. toggle red_door_2 (this unlocks red_door_2)
11. gotoempty (going to an empty position in room_3)
12. drop grey_ball_1 room_3
13. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_3
14. pick grey_box_1 room_3 (this satisfies constraint 3 and part of constraint 6)
15. gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_2 (now I'm in room_4, satisfying constraint 10)
16. gotoempty (going to an empty position in room_4)
17. drop grey_box_1 room_4
18. gotoobject green_ball_2 room_4
19. pick green_ball_2 room_4 (this satisfies constraint 3: holding green_ball_2)
20. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_2
21. toggle purple_door_1 (this unlocks purple_door_1, satisfying constraint 6)
22. gotoroom room_4 room_2 purple_door_1 (now I'm in room_2)
23. gotoempty (going to an empty position in room_2)
24. drop green_ball_2 room_2
25. gotoobject green_ball_2 room_2 (this satisfies constraint 1: in front of green_ball_2 in room_2)
26. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_1
27. gotoroom room_2 room_1 yellow_door_1 (back to room_1)
28. gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_1 (this satisfies the main task)

Let's quickly verify the plan once more:

1. gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_1: Valid.
2. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2: Valid.
3. toggle yellow_door_1: Valid.
4. gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3: Valid.
5. toggle red_door_1: Valid.
6. gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1: Valid.
7. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_3: Valid.
8. pick grey_ball_1 room_3: Valid.
9. gotodoor red_door_2 room_3 room_4: Valid.
10. toggle red_door_2: Valid.
11. gotoempty: Valid.
12. drop grey_ball_1 room_3: Valid.
13. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_3: Valid.
14. pick grey_box_1 room_3: Valid.
15. gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_2: Valid.
16. gotoempty: Valid.
17. drop grey_box_1 room_4: Valid.
18. gotoobject green_ball_2 room_4: Valid.
19. pick green_ball_2 room_4: Valid.
20. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_2: Valid.
21. toggle purple_door_1: Valid.
22. gotoroom room_4 room_2 purple_door_1: Valid.
23. gotoempty: Valid.
24. drop green_ball_2 room_2: Valid.
25. gotoobject green_ball_2 room_2: Valid.
26. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_1: Valid.
27. gotoroom room_2 room_1 yellow_door_1: Valid.
28. gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_1: Valid.

The plan seems valid, but I'm still a bit worried about the "drop" actions. The precondition for the "drop" action states that I can only drop an object if the position in front of me is empty. So after using "gotoempty", I would be in front of an empty position, which should allow me to drop the object.

Let's verify again that I've satisfied all the constraints:

1. Be in front of green_ball_2 in room_2: Satisfied at step 25.
2. Hold some object: Satisfied at steps 8, 14, and 19.
3. Hold green_ball_2 or grey_box_1: Satisfied at steps 14 and 19.
4. Be in front of red_door_2: Satisfied at step 9.
5. yellow_door_1 is unlocked and I'm in front of grey_ball_1: Satisfied at step 7 (yellow_door_1 is unlocked at step 3, and I'm in front of grey_ball_1 at step 7).
6. Hold grey_box_1 or purple_door_1 is unlocked: Satisfied at steps 14 and 21.
7. Be in front of grey_ball_1: Satisfied at step 7.
8. Be in room_3 or yellow_door_1 is unlocked: Satisfied at steps 3 and 6.
9. Hold grey_ball_1: Satisfied at step 8.
10. Hold grey_box_1 or be in room_4: Satisfied at steps 14 and 15.

Yes, I've satisfied all the constraints. The main task is to be in front of a yellow ball, which is satisfied at step 28 when I'm in front of yellow_ball_1 in room_1.

Let me provide the final plan:

1. gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_1
2. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2
3. toggle yellow_door_1
4. gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3
5. toggle red_door_1
6. gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1
7. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_3
8. pick grey_ball_1 room_3
9. gotodoor red_door_2 room_3 room_4
10. toggle red_door_2
11. gotoempty
12. drop grey_ball_1 room_3
13. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_3
14. pick grey_box_1 room_3
15. gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_2
16. gotoempty
17. drop grey_box_1 room_4
18. gotoobject green_ball_2 room_4
19. pick green_ball_2 room_4
20. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_2
21. toggle purple_door_1
22. gotoroom room_4 room_2 purple_door_1
23. gotoempty
24. drop green_ball_2 room_2
25. gotoobject green_ball_2 room_2
26. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_1
27. gotoroom room_2 room_1 yellow_door_1
28. gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_1

Wait, I think I may have misunderstood the state in the gridworld. I need to understand the exact layout and which objects are in which rooms.

Rooms are arranged in a square formation:
- room_1 is on the north-west
- room_2 is on the south-west
- room_3 is on the north-east
- room_4 is on the south-east

The rooms are connected by doors:
- yellow_door_1 connects room_1 and room_2
- red_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3
- purple_door_1 connects room_2 and room_4
- red_door_2 connects room_3 and room_4

The objects in each room:
- room_1: yellow_ball_1
- room_3: red_box_1, grey_box_1, blue_ball_1, grey_ball_1, green_ball_1
- room_4: green_ball_2, yellow_ball_2

All doors are locked initially.

I am in room_1 and need to be in front of a yellow ball, either yellow_ball_1 (which is already in room_1) or yellow_ball_2 (which is in room_4).

Now, let's revise the plan based on this understanding:

1. gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_1 (to be in front of a yellow ball, satisfying the main task, but I still need to fulfill all the constraints)
2. pick yellow_ball_1 room_1 (to satisfy constraint 2: hold some object)
3. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2
4. toggle yellow_door_1 (this unlocks yellow_door_1, satisfying parts of constraints 5 and 8)
5. gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1 (now I'm in room_2)
6. gotoempty
7. drop yellow_ball_1 room_2
8. gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_1
9. gotoroom room_2 room_1 yellow_door_1 (back to room_1)
10. gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3
11. toggle red_door_1 (this unlocks red_door_1)
12. gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1 (now I'm in room_3, which satisfies part of constraint 8)
13. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_3 (this, combined with the fact that yellow_door_1 is unlocked, satisfies constraint 5 and 7)
14. pick grey_ball_1 room_3 (this satisfies constraint 9 and constraint 2: holding some object)
15. gotodoor red_door_2 room_3 room_4 (this satisfies constraint 4)
16. toggle red_door_2 (this unlocks red_door_2)
17. gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_2 (now I'm in room_4, satisfying constraint 10)
18. gotoempty
19. drop grey_ball_1 room_4
20. gotoobject green_ball_2 room_4
21. pick green_ball_2 room_4 (this satisfies constraint 3: holding green_ball_2)
22. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_2
23. toggle purple_door_1 (this unlocks purple_door_1, satisfying constraint 6)
24. gotoroom room_4 room_2 purple_door_1 (now I'm in room_2)
25. gotoempty
26. drop green_ball_2 room_2
27. gotoobject green_ball_2 room_2 (this satisfies constraint 1: in front of green_ball_2 in room_2)
28. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_3 (to pick up grey_box_1 for constraint 3)
29. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_1
30. gotoroom room_2 room_1 yellow_door_1 (back to room_1)
31. gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3
32. gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1 (back to room_3)
33. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_3
34. pick grey_box_1 room_3 (this satisfies constraint 3 and part of constraint 6)
35. gotoempty
36. drop grey_box_1 room_3
37. gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2 (to satisfy the main task)
38. gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1
39. gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1 (back to room_1)
40. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2
41. gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1 (back to room_2)
42. gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2 (this satisfies the main task)

I think I need to be more careful about the current state of the world after each action. The actions have effects which change the state of the world. This is getting a bit complex to keep track of manually.

Let me simplify my plan. The main task is to be in front of a yellow ball. yellow_ball_1 is in room_1, and yellow_ball_2 is in room_4. It would be easiest to just go to yellow_ball_1 in room_1, but I need to satisfy all the constraints.

OK, let me reorganize this. I'm revisiting my plan.

1. I am initially in room_1 and yellow_ball_1 is also in room_1.
2. I'll start by going to yellow_ball_1: gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_1.
3. I want to fulfill the constraint requiring yellow_door_1 to be unlocked and me to be in front of grey_ball_1. I'll do the following:
   a. First, go to yellow_door_1: gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2.
   b. Toggle yellow_door_1 to unlock it: toggle yellow_door_1.
   c. Go to room_3 to be in front of grey_ball_1.
      i. First, go to red_door_1: gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3.
      ii. Toggle red_door_1 to unlock it: toggle red_door_1.
      iii. Go to room_3: gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1.
