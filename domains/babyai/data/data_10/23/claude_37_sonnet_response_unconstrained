Let's understand the problem and goal:

We're navigating a 2D gridworld with 4 rooms in a square formation. We have various objects (balls and boxes) and doors with colors. Our task is to find a sequence of actions to satisfy the goal.

The goal is to be in front of a yellow ball.

Let's assess the initial state:
- We're in room_1.
- There's a yellow_ball_1 in room_1 (and it's yellow).
- There's also a yellow_ball_2 in room_4 (and it's yellow).
- All doors are locked.

Since our goal is to be in front of a yellow ball, and there's a yellow_ball_1 in room_1 where we are currently, we should be able to accomplish this goal by just moving to stand in front of yellow_ball_1.

Let's construct the plan:
1. gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_1 - This will position us in front of the yellow ball in room_1.

Let me double-check if this plan satisfies the goal:
The goal is to find a yellow ball v and to be in front of v. After executing our plan, we'll be in front of yellow_ball_1, which is indeed yellow. So, this should satisfy the goal.

Let's see if there are any constraints or complications I'm missing:
- We don't need to pick up the ball or do anything with the doors, since we only need to be in front of the yellow ball.
- We don't need to navigate to other rooms.

So, the plan should be simple: gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_1.

Let me just double-check the available actions and constraints to ensure this is valid:

"gotoobject x r": Go in front of to object x in room r.
Precondition: you may only go in front of an object x if you are in the same room as x.
Effects: (i) if you were in front of some object or door x0, then you are no longer in front of x0 and (ii) you are in front of object x.

In our case, we're in room_1 and yellow_ball_1 is also in room_1. So, the precondition for gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_1 is satisfied. After executing this action, we'll be in front of yellow_ball_1, satisfying the goal.

So, the optimal plan is:
```
gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_1
```

One thing to check is that we're not already in front of something at the start. The initial state doesn't say anything about us being in front of an object or door, so I'll assume we're not in front of anything. If we were, the effect of the gotoobject action would ensure we're no longer in front of the previous object/door.

Actually, the gotoobject action has an important precondition: the object needs to be in the room where we are. Let's double-check this:
Initial state: "yellow_ball_1 is in room_1" and "you are in room_1". So, the precondition is satisfied.

So, the optimal plan is:
```
gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_1
```

Actually, the action names in the available actions are a bit inconsistent. Let me check how the action is defined:

Actually, rereading the problem description, the action is indeed "gotoobject" as I've written, not "goto object" with a space. So, I'm confident that the plan is:

```
gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_1
```

And this should satisfy the goal: "There is a ball v such that "The following conditions are all true: "v is yellow", "you are in front of v""".

Actually, let me check the precise wording of the action again:

"gotoobject x r": Go in front of to object x in room r.

Actually, looking back through the problem description, it seems I got confused with the spacing in the action names. The actions are described with spaces:

"goto object": you may only go in front of an object x if you are in the same room as x.
"goto empty": you may go in front of an empty position anytime.

But in the preconditions/effects, it's written as "goto object", "goto empty", etc. with a space.

I need to be careful about the action names. Let's check the action in the problem definition:

"goto object x r": Go in front of to object x in room r.

Actually, I'm getting confused. The problem description lists the available actions as:

	"gotoobject x r": Go in front of to object x in room r.
	"gotoempty": Go in front of an empty position of the room, which does not contain any object.
	"gotodoor d r1 r2": Go in front of door d, connecting room r1 to room r2.
	"gotoroom r1 r2 d": Go to room r2 from room r1 using door d.
	"pick x r": Pick up object x in room r.
	"drop x r": Drop object x in room r.
	"toggle d": Unlock door d if is locked. Lock door d if is unlocked.

But in the preconditions/effects section, it refers to actions like "goto object". I think the correct action names are without spaces, as listed in the available actions section.

So, the optimal plan is:
```
gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_1
```

Wait, I need to be more careful here. Let me re-read the available actions:

"gotoobject x r": Go in front of to object x in room r.

Yes, "gotoobject" without a space. And when I looked at the preconditions, it says:

"goto object": you may only go in front of an object x if you are in the same room as x.

This is confusing. It's "gotoobject" in one section and "goto object" in another. Let me look at similar actions to infer the correct format.

For instance, "gotoempty" in the available actions section matches with "goto empty" in the preconditions/effects section. This suggests that there's a discrepancy in formatting, but they're referring to the same action.

Since the actual plan I'm formulating should use the format from the available actions section, I'll use "gotoobject" (without a space).

So, the optimal plan is:
```
gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_1
```

I think we're overthinking the action naming convention. Let's go with the format from the available actions section, which is what's expected for the plan. The format for "gotoobject" is:

"gotoobject x r": Go in front of to object x in room r.

So, the plan is:

```
gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_1
```

This should position us in front of yellow_ball_1, which is yellow, thereby satisfying the goal.

Actually, let me reconsider from the start to ensure I'm not missing anything.

Goal: "There is a ball v such that "The following conditions are all true: "v is yellow", "you are in front of v""".

We need to be in front of a yellow ball. There are two yellow balls in the world: yellow_ball_1 in room_1 and yellow_ball_2 in room_4.

We're initially in room_1, so we can directly go to yellow_ball_1 using the "gotoobject" action. The precondition for this action is that we need to be in the same room as the object, which is satisfied.

So, the optimal plan should be:
```
gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_1
```

Let me think about the whole action, not just the action name. If we look at the "gotoobject" action:

"gotoobject x r": Go in front of to object x in room r.

The action requires two parameters: the object x and the room r. In our case, x = yellow_ball_1 and r = room_1.

So the action would be: "gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_1".

This is what I've been concluding, and I'm confident it's the correct format and plan for the given problem. By executing this action, we'll be in front of yellow_ball_1, which is a yellow ball, satisfying the goal.

Let's double check the plan:
```
gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_1
```

The format of each action in the plan should be: 'ActionName Argument1 ... ArgumentN', where each argument is an element of the domain. Also, we need to delineate the plan with one top line and one bottom line containing only 3 '`' characters.

So, the optimal plan will be:
```
gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_1
```

Actually, I'm checking the problem description again, and it says:

"The format of each action in the plan should be: 'ActionName Argument1 ... ArgumentN', where each argument is an element of the domain. Write each action of a plan in a separate line. Delineate the plan with one top line and one bottom line containing only 3  '`' characters."

So I need to format the plan with the top and bottom lines containing only 3 '`' characters, like this:

```
gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_1
```

But actually, this is what I've already written. So I think my plan is correct. For clarity, let me write it again with the specified delineation:

```
gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_1
```

Actually, let me revise the plan to the format I think is being expected:

```
```
gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_1
```
```

Hmm, that's not right, as the backticks would be 3, not the whole line. Let me try again:

```
```
gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_1
```
```

Wait, I'm misinterpreting something. Let's see what the exact instruction is:

"The format of each action in the plan should be: 'ActionName Argument1 ... ArgumentN', where each argument is an element of the domain. Write each action of a plan in a separate line. Delineate the plan with one top line and one bottom line containing only 3  '`' characters."

So, the plan should be delineated with a top and bottom line, each containing only 3 backtick characters. The rest of the lines should contain the actions of the plan.

Here's the format:
```
(top line with 3 backticks)
Action1 Arg1 ... ArgN
Action2 Arg1 ... ArgN
...
(bottom line with 3 backticks)
```

Given that the optimal plan has only one action, the formatted plan would look like:

```
```
gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_1
```
```

No, that's not right. I'm trying to represent a plan that has the following three lines:
1. A line with three backticks.
2. The action "gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_1".
3. Another line with three backticks.

But the way I'm writing it in Markdown, the backticks are interpreted as code blocks. I want to produce an output that has exactly three lines, as described above.

So the final plan would be 

(3 backticks)
gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_1
(3 backticks)

But I'm finding it difficult to represent all these in Markdown. Let me try once more:

\`\`\`
gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_1
\`\`\`

No, that doesn't work because the backslashes are interfering. Let's try another approach:

The first line contains only three backticks.
The second line contains the action.
The third line contains only three backticks.

Maybe this will help convey the format more clearly.

OK, I give up on trying to get Markdown to display exactly what I want. I'll try to describe the plan as explicitly as possible:

The plan consists of three lines:
1. The first line contains only three backtick characters: ```
2. The second line contains the action: gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_1
3. The third line contains only three backtick characters: ```

OK so my answer is:

```
gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_1
```

I'm not explicitly writing the top and bottom lines with three backticks here because they're getting interpreted as Markdown code blocks. But the answer should include these as its first and third lines.

Actually the above representation of the plan, with 3 backticks at the top and 3 backticks at the bottom, does make sense as a standard Markdown code block. The problem is requesting a specific format for the plan where it's delineated with these exact lines. It makes more sense this way. Let me proceed with the Markdown code block format:

```
gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_1
```

I think this conveys the correct plan in the specified format.
