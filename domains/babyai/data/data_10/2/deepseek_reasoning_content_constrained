Okay, let's tackle this planning problem step by step. The goal is to get a yellow ball in front of me, but there are a bunch of constraints I need to satisfy along the way. Let's break down what needs to be done.

First, the initial state: I'm in room_2. The yellow_ball_1 is here, along with some boxes. The final goal is to be in front of a yellow ball. Since yellow_ball_1 is in room_2 initially, maybe that's the easiest target. But wait, there's also yellow_ball_2 in room_3 and purple_ball_1 in room_4. But the goal is any yellow ball, so either works. But maybe room_2's yellow_ball_1 is the closest, but I need to check the constraints.

Now, the constraints. Let's list them:

1. At some point, I must be holding an object.
2. At some point, I must be in front of blue_door_3.
3. At some point, I'm in room_3 and yellow_box_1 is there.
4. Either I'm in front of purple_ball_1 or green_box_1 is in room_4.
5. I must visit room_1.
6. At some point, I'm in front of green_box_1 and green_door_1 is unlocked.
7. Either empty is in room_1 (which it always is, maybe?) or grey_box_1 is in room_3.
8. blue_door_1 must be unlocked at some point.
9. green_box_1 must be in room_2 at some point.

Hmm. Let's see. Starting with room_2. The doors are all locked initially. So I can't move unless I unlock them. But to unlock a door, I need to toggle it, which requires being in front of it. But to get in front of a door, I need to be in a room connected by that door, and no object is blocking the position in front of the door. Wait, but in room_2, there's blue_door_1 (connects to room_1) and blue_door_3 (connects to room_4). Are there any objects blocking those doors? The initial state says in room_2, there's yellow_ball_1, grey_box_1, yellow_box_1, grey_box_2. The doors are blue_door_1 and blue_door_3. So if any of these objects are in front of the doors, then I can't go to the door. But the problem doesn't specify positions of objects relative to doors. Wait, the problem's initial state only mentions which room objects are in, not their exact positions. So maybe the assumption is that objects are not blocking doors unless stated. So maybe I can go to the doors as long as I'm in the right room.

Wait, the preconditions for "gotodoor d r1 r2" are: (i) in a room connected by d, and (ii) no object blocking the position in front of d in the current room. But since the initial state doesn't mention any object blocking doors, maybe they're not blocked. So I can go to the door.

But all doors are locked. So to unlock a door, I need to toggle it. But to toggle, I need to be in front of it. So first, go to the door, then toggle it. Let's start with blue_door_1, which connects room_2 and room_1. If I can unlock that, I can go to room_1, which is one of the constraints (constraint 5). Also, constraint 8 requires blue_door_1 to be unlocked at some point. So unlocking blue_door_1 would satisfy that.

So steps:

1. gotoempty in room_2. Since I can go to an empty position any time. But why? Maybe to move around. Wait, but maybe I need to first go to the door. Let's see. To unlock blue_door_1, I need to be in front of it. So first, "gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1". Then "toggle blue_door_1" to unlock it. Then I can go to room_1 via gotoroom room_2 room_1 blue_door_1. That would satisfy constraint 5 (being in room_1) and constraint 8 (blue_door_1 unlocked).

But wait, constraint 8 requires that blue_door_1 is not locked at some point. So after toggling, it becomes unlocked. So that's covered.

But then, after unlocking blue_door_1, I can go to room_1. But room_1 is connected to room_3 via blue_door_2, which is also locked. So maybe I need to unlock that next. Let's see.

But also, constraint 3 requires that at some point, I'm in room_3 and yellow_box_1 is there. Currently, yellow_box_1 is in room_2. So I need to move it to room_3. But how? To move it, I need to pick it up and drop it in room_3. But to carry it, I need to pick it up. But to pick it up, I need to be in the same room as it (room_2) and not holding anything. So perhaps after unlocking blue_door_1, I can go back to room_2, pick up yellow_box_1, then take it to room_3 via blue_door_2 (unlocking that door first). Let's see.

Wait, but room_3 is connected to room_1 via blue_door_2, which is locked. So to get to room_3 from room_1, I need to unlock blue_door_2. But that's in room_1. So steps:

- From room_2, unlock blue_door_1, go to room_1. Then go to blue_door_2 in room_1, unlock it, then go to room_3. But then I can take yellow_box_1 from room_2 to room_3. But how?

Wait, maybe it's better to first unlock blue_door_1, go to room_1, unlock blue_door_2, go to room_3. But then, how do I get yellow_box_1 from room_2 to room_3? Because I can't carry it unless I go back to room_2, pick it up, and then go through room_1 and room_3. But that's a long path. Alternatively, maybe there's another door. Let me check the connections.

The doors are:

- blue_door_1 connects room_1 and room_2.

- blue_door_2 connects room_1 and room_3.

- blue_door_3 connects room_2 and room_4.

- green_door_1 connects room_3 and room_4.

So, to get from room_2 to room_3, the path is room_2 -> room_1 (via blue_door_1) -> room_3 (via blue_door_2). But both doors are locked initially. So need to unlock them.

Alternatively, maybe go through room_4. Room_2 is connected to room_4 via blue_door_3, which is locked. Room_4 is connected to room_3 via green_door_1, which is locked. So that's another path. But unlocking those doors would take more steps. So maybe the first path is better.

But let's think about all the constraints. Let's list all constraints again to see what's needed:

Constraints:

1. Hold an object: So need to pick up something.

2. In front of blue_door_3: That's in room_2 or room_4. Since I start in room_2, maybe I can go to blue_door_3 there.

3. Be in room_3 and have yellow_box_1 there. Since yellow_box_1 starts in room_2, need to move it.

4. Either be in front of purple_ball_1 (in room_4) or have green_box_1 in room_4. Green_box_1 is initially in room_3. So maybe moving it to room_4 would satisfy this. Alternatively, visiting room_4 and being in front of purple_ball_1.

5. Visit room_1.

6. Be in front of green_box_1 (in room_3) and green_door_1 is unlocked. So need to unlock green_door_1, which connects room_3 and room_4. So need to be in front of green_door_1 in room_3 or 4, then toggle it. Also, green_box_1 is in room_3 initially, so being in front of it there after unlocking green_door_1 would satisfy this.

7. Either empty is in room_1 (which is always true, since empty is a position, not an object?) or grey_box_1 is in room_3. Since grey_box_1 is in room_2 initially, need to move it to room_3. So this constraint can be satisfied by moving grey_box_1 to room_3.

8. blue_door_1 unlocked: already covered by unlocking it.

9. green_box_1 in room_2: so need to move green_box_1 from room_3 to room_2.

So, the constraints require moving multiple objects:

- yellow_box_1 from room_2 to room_3 (for constraint 3)

- grey_box_1 from room_2 to room_3 (for constraint 7)

- green_box_1 from room_3 to room_2 (for constraint 9)

Also, need to unlock green_door_1 (for constraint 6), which connects room_3 and room_4. To unlock it, need to be in front of it. So either from room_3 or room_4. Since green_box_1 is in room_3, maybe go to room_3, unlock green_door_1, then go to room_4.

But let's outline the steps:

First, unlock blue_door_1 in room_2. Then go to room_1. Then unlock blue_door_2 in room_1. Then go to room_3. Then unlock green_door_1. Then perhaps go to room_4. But also need to move objects.

But the key is to plan a sequence that satisfies all constraints with minimal steps.

Let me try to outline a possible plan:

1. Start in room_2.

2. Go to blue_door_1 in room_2 (gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1).

3. Toggle blue_door_1 (unlocks it, satisfying constraint 8).

4. Gotoroom room_2 room_1 blue_door_1 (now in room_1, satisfying constraint 5).

5. Now in room_1. Need to unlock blue_door_2 to get to room_3.

6. Go to blue_door_2 in room_1 (gotodoor blue_door_2 room_1 room_3).

7. Toggle blue_door_2 (unlock it).

8. Gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_2 (now in room_3).

Now, in room_3, which has green_box_1. Need to satisfy constraint 6: in front of green_box_1 and green_door_1 is unlocked. So first, unlock green_door_1.

9. Go to green_door_1 in room_3 (gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4).

10. Toggle green_door_1 (unlock it).

11. Now, in front of green_door_1. Also, green_box_1 is in room_3. So gotoobject green_box_1 room_3. Then, since green_door_1 is unlocked, this satisfies constraint 6 (in front of green_box_1 and green_door_1 is unlocked). But wait, need to be in front of green_box_1 and have green_door_1 unlocked. So after step 10, green_door_1 is unlocked. Then, go to green_box_1. So steps:

After step 10 (unlocking green_door_1):

11. gotoobject green_box_1 room_3. Now in front of green_box_1, and green_door_1 is unlocked. So constraint 6 is satisfied here.

Now, need to move green_box_1 to room_2 (constraint 9). To do that, pick it up, take it back through room_1 to room_2.

12. pick green_box_1 room_3. Now holding it (satisfies constraint 1).

13. Need to go back to room_1. So go to blue_door_2 (already unlocked) in room_3, then gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_2.

14. Then go to blue_door_1 in room_1 (unlocked), gotoroom room_1 room_2 blue_door_1.

15. Drop green_box_1 in room_2: drop green_box_1 room_2. Now constraint 9 is satisfied.

Now, need to get yellow_box_1 to room_3 (constraint 3). Since yellow_box_1 is in room_2, pick it up and take it to room_3.

But I'm now in room_2. So:

16. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_2.

17. pick yellow_box_1 room_2. (Now holding it again, but constraint 1 already satisfied earlier.)

18. Go to blue_door_1 in room_2 (unlocked), gotoroom room_2 room_1 blue_door_1.

19. Then to blue_door_2 in room_1, gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_2.

20. Drop yellow_box_1 in room_3. Now constraint 3 is satisfied (I'm in room_3, and yellow_box_1 is there).

But also, constraint 3 requires that at some point, I'm in room_3 and yellow_box_1 is there. So after dropping it, that's true.

Now, constraint 7: either empty is in room_1 (which it is, since empty positions are always there) or grey_box_1 is in room_3. If we choose the first option, that's automatically true. But maybe the problem considers "empty" as an object, but likely not. So perhaps the constraint is satisfied by empty being in room_1. But if the problem requires that "empty is in room_1" as an object, which I don't think is the case. The empty_0 is an object, but it's of type empty. Wait, the objects include "empty_0 empty", but the initial state doesn't say where it is. Hmm, this is confusing. The constraint says "empty is in room_1" or "grey_box_1 is in room_3". Since empty_0 is an object of type empty, but the initial state doesn't mention its location, maybe it's not present. So perhaps the only way to satisfy constraint 7 is to move grey_box_1 to room_3. So that's another required action.

So we need to move grey_box_1 from room_2 to room_3.

So after step 15 (green_box_1 is in room_2), perhaps before moving yellow_box_1, go back to room_2, pick grey_box_1, take it to room_3.

But this adds steps. Let's see:

After step 15 (green_box_1 in room_2), we are in room_2. Then:

16. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_2.

17. pick grey_box_1 room_2. (Now holding it, but constraint 1 already satisfied earlier.)

18. Go to room_1 via blue_door_1.

19. Go to room_3 via blue_door_2.

20. Drop grey_box_1 in room_3. Now constraint 7 is satisfied.

Then proceed to handle yellow_box_1 as before.

But this adds several steps. Alternatively, maybe during the initial movement of yellow_box_1, we can also move grey_box_1. But that would require multiple trips.

Alternatively, maybe after moving green_box_1 to room_2, we can pick up both grey_box_1 and yellow_box_1 in room_2, but we can only carry one at a time.

This is getting complicated. Let's see if there's a more optimal path.

Wait, another constraint is constraint 4: either be in front of purple_ball_1 (in room_4) or have green_box_1 in room_4. Since green_box_1 is moved to room_2 (constraint 9), so the second condition (green_box_1 in room_4) is not possible. So to satisfy constraint 4, must be in front of purple_ball_1 in room_4. So need to go to room_4 and be in front of purple_ball_1.

So steps to room_4:

From room_3, after unlocking green_door_1 (step 10), can go to room_4 via green_door_1.

So after step 10, perhaps:

11. gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_1 (now in room_4).

12. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4. Now in front of purple_ball_1, satisfying constraint 4.

Then, return to room_3 via green_door_1 (but need to make sure the door is still unlocked). Since we toggled it once (unlocked), unless we toggle it again, it remains unlocked.

But this adds steps. Alternatively, during the process of moving to room_4, we can satisfy constraint 4.

But this requires going to room_4. How?

Alternatively, from room_2, there's blue_door_3 connecting to room_4. If we can unlock blue_door_3, then go to room_4. But blue_door_3 is in room_2, initially locked. So steps:

From room_2, after unlocking blue_door_1 and going to room_1, but maybe instead, first unlock blue_door_3 in room_2, then go to room_4. Let's see.

Alternative path:

1. Start in room_2.

2. Gotodoor blue_door_3 room_2 room_4.

3. Toggle blue_door_3 (unlocks it).

4. Now can go to room_4.

But this would satisfy constraint 2 (being in front of blue_door_3) during step 2.

Then, in room_4, can go to purple_ball_1 (satisfy constraint 4).

But then need to also handle other constraints. For example, moving green_box_1 to room_2, which is in room_3 initially. So maybe combining both paths.

But this might complicate the plan. Let's see.

Alternatively, let's try to find the optimal path by considering all constraints and how they can be satisfied with minimal steps.

Let's list all constraints again:

1. Hold an object. (Must pick up something once.)

2. In front of blue_door_3. (Can do in room_2.)

3. In room_3 with yellow_box_1. (Need to move yellow_box_1 to room_3.)

4. In front of purple_ball_1 or green_box_1 in room_4. (But green_box_1 is moved to room_2, so must go to room_4.)

5. Visit room_1.

6. In front of green_box_1 (room_3) and green_door_1 unlocked.

7. empty in room_1 or grey_box_1 in room_3. (Probably move grey_box_1.)

8. blue_door_1 unlocked.

9. green_box_1 in room_2.

So the steps need to include:

- Unlock blue_door_1 (to visit room_1 and unlock constraint 8).

- Unlock blue_door_2 (to reach room_3).

- Unlock green_door_1 (to reach room_4 and satisfy constraint 6).

- Move green_box_1 from room_3 to room_2 (constraint 9).

- Move yellow_box_1 from room_2 to room_3 (constraint 3).

- Move grey_box_1 from room_2 to room_3 (constraint 7).

- Visit room_4 to be in front of purple_ball_1 (constraint 4).

- Be in front of blue_door_3 (constraint 2).

- Hold an object (constraint 1).

Also, after dropping green_box_1 in room_2, need to pick up yellow_box_1 and grey_box_1.

But carrying objects requires multiple pick and drop steps.

Let me try to outline a possible optimal path:

1. Start in room_2.

2. Go to blue_door_1 in room_2 (gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1).

3. Toggle blue_door_1 (unlock it; constraint 8).

4. Gotoroom room_2 room_1 blue_door_1 (now in room_1; constraint 5).

5. Go to blue_door_2 in room_1 (gotodoor blue_door_2 room_1 room_3).

6. Toggle blue_door_2 (unlock it).

7. Gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_2 (now in room_3).

8. Go to green_door_1 in room_3 (gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4).

9. Toggle green_door_1 (unlock it).

10. Gotoobject green_box_1 room_3 (now in front of it; green_door_1 is unlocked, so constraint 6 satisfied).

11. Pick green_box_1 room_3 (holding it; constraint 1 satisfied).

12. Return to room_1 via blue_door_2.

13. Go back to room_2 via blue_door_1.

14. Drop green_box_1 in room_2 (constraint 9 satisfied).

15. Now, need to move yellow_box_1 and grey_box_1 to room_3.

But first, pick up yellow_box_1:

16. Gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_2.

17. Pick yellow_box_1 room_2.

18. Go to room_1, then room_3.

19. Drop yellow_box_1 in room_3 (constraint 3 satisfied).

20. Return to room_2, pick grey_box_1.

21. Take it to room_3 and drop it (constraint 7 satisfied).

Then, go to room_4 to satisfy constraint 4:

22. From room_3, go to green_door_1 (unlocked), then to room_4.

23. Gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4 (constraint 4 satisfied).

Also, need to be in front of blue_door_3 (constraint 2). Since blue_door_3 is in room_2 and room_4. So maybe after step 14 (in room_2), go to blue_door_3:

15. After dropping green_box_1 in room_2, gotoempty to clear front, then gotodoor blue_door_3 room_2 room_4 (satisfy constraint 2).

Then proceed to pick up yellow_box_1.

Wait, let's adjust the steps:

After step 14 (green_box_1 in room_2):

15. Gotodoor blue_door_3 room_2 room_4 (constraint 2 satisfied here).

16. Toggle blue_door_3 (unlock it).

17. Gotoroom room_2 room_4 blue_door_3 (now in room_4).

18. Gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4 (constraint 4 satisfied).

19. Then return to room_2 via blue_door_3 (but it's now unlocked).

Then proceed to pick up yellow_box_1 and grey_box_1.

This way, constraint 2 is satisfied at step 15, and constraint 4 at step 18.

But this adds steps. Alternatively, after unlocking blue_door_3, go to room_4 and then return.

But how does this affect the overall plan length?

Alternatively, when moving from room_2 to room_4 via blue_door_3, after unlocking it, can go to room_4 and satisfy constraint 4, then return to room_2 to pick up objects.

But let's try to integrate this.

Revised steps:

1. room_2: goto blue_door_1, unlock, go to room_1.

2. room_1: goto blue_door_2, unlock, go to room_3.

3. room_3: unlock green_door_1, go to green_box_1, pick it up.

4. Return to room_2 via room_1, drop green_box_1.

5. Go to blue_door_3 in room_2, unlock it (toggle), go to room_4, goto purple_ball_1 (constraint 4), then return.

6. Pick yellow_box_1 and grey_box_1 in room_2, take to room_3.

But this is getting quite lengthy. Let's count the steps.

Alternative approach: Since the final goal is to be in front of a yellow ball, which could be yellow_ball_1 in room_2, but after moving it, perhaps not. Wait, the final goal is "There is a ball v such that v is yellow, and you are in front of v". So as long as at the end, I'm in front of any yellow ball. yellow_ball_1 is in room_2 initially. So maybe I can just pick it up and drop it again to be in front of it. But if I need to be in front of it, perhaps the simplest way is to gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2 and drop there. But the final state must have me in front of a yellow ball.

But if I have to drop it, then I need to pick it up and then drop it. Because after dropping, I'm in front of it.

Wait, the drop action's effect is that you are in front of the object. So, if I pick up yellow_ball_1 and then drop it in the same room, I'll be in front of it, satisfying the goal.

So the final steps could be: pick yellow_ball_1, then drop it. But need to ensure that after dropping, I'm in front of it.

But let's check the preconditions for drop: you must be holding the object and the position in front must be empty. So after picking up yellow_ball_1, to drop it, I need to be in front of an empty position. Wait, no: when you drop, you are in front of x. The drop action's precondition is that you're holding x and the position in front is empty. Wait, but the "drop x r" action's effect is that you are in front of x. So after dropping, you are in front of x, which would satisfy the goal.

So maybe the plan can end with dropping yellow_ball_1 in room_2, thus being in front of it. But during the plan, we need to pick it up and drop it again.

But the initial state has yellow_ball_1 in room_2, so if I pick it up and drop it in room_2, it's still there, and I'm in front of it. So this could be a quick way to satisfy the goal. But then, all constraints must be satisfied during the plan.

However, this approach would require:

- Pick up yellow_ball_1 (satisfy constraint 1).

- Drop it, being in front of it (satisfy goal).

But need to also satisfy other constraints. For example, constraint 2 requires being in front of blue_door_3. So before dropping the ball, I need to have gone to blue_door_3.

But how to fit all constraints.

Let's see:

If the plan is:

1. gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2. (Precondition: in same room.)

2. pick yellow_ball_1 room_2. (Now holding it, constraint 1 satisfied.)

3. drop yellow_ball_1 room_2. (Now in front of it, goal achieved.)

But this doesn't satisfy other constraints. For example, constraint 2 (in front of blue_door_3), constraint 3 (in room_3 with yellow_box_1), etc. So this approach won't work.

Thus, need to find a path that satisfies all constraints.

Alternative idea: Use the movement of objects to satisfy multiple constraints. For example, moving green_box_1 to room_2 satisfies constraint 9. Moving grey_box_1 to room_3 satisfies constraint 7. Moving yellow_box_1 to room_3 satisfies constraint 3. Unlocking blue_door_3 and being in front of it satisfies constraint 2. Unlocking green_door_1 and being in front of green_box_1 satisfies constraint 6. Visiting room_1 satisfies constraint 5. Unlocking blue_door_1 satisfies constraint 8. Going to room_4 and being in front of purple_ball_1 satisfies constraint 4. And holding an object (green_box_1, yellow_box_1, grey_box_1) satisfies constraint 1.

Now, let's try to structure the plan step-by-step, integrating all these.

Start in room_2.

1. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1. (Pre: in room_2, door connects here. No object blocking.)

2. toggle blue_door_1. (Now unlocked, constraint 8.)

3. gotoroom room_2 room_1 blue_door_1. (Now in room_1, constraint 5.)

4. gotodoor blue_door_2 room_1 room_3.

5. toggle blue_door_2. (Unlocks it.)

6. gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_2. (Now in room_3.)

7. gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4.

8. toggle green_door_1. (Unlocks it.)

9. gotoobject green_box_1 room_3. (Now in front of it; green_door_1 is unlocked. Constraint 6 satisfied.)

10. pick green_box_1 room_3. (Holding, constraint 1.)

11. gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_2. (Back to room_1.)

12. gotoroom room_1 room_2 blue_door_1. (Back to room_2.)

13. drop green_box_1 room_2. (Constraint 9 satisfied.)

14. gotodoor blue_door_3 room_2 room_4. (Constraint 2 satisfied.)

15. toggle blue_door_3. (Unlocks it.)

16. gotoroom room_2 room_4 blue_door_3. (Now in room_4.)

17. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4. (Constraint 4 satisfied.)

18. gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1. (Back to room_3.)

19. gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_2. (To room_1.)

20. gotoroom room_1 room_2 blue_door_1. (Back to room_2.)

21. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_2.

22. pick grey_box_1 room_2.

23. gotoroom room_2 room_1 blue_door_1.

24. gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_2.

25. drop grey_box_1 room_3. (Constraint 7 satisfied.)

26. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_3. (Now in room_3, yellow_box_1 is here. Constraint 3 satisfied.)

But wait, yellow_box_1 was initially in room_2. Did we move it? No, in the steps so far, we haven't moved yellow_box_1. So this is a problem. We need to move yellow_box_1 to room_3.

So after step 13 (green_box_1 in room_2), we need to pick up yellow_box_1.

Let's adjust steps:

After step 13:

14. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_2.

15. pick yellow_box_1 room_2.

16. gotoroom room_2 room_1 blue_door_1.

17. gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_2.

18. drop yellow_box_1 room_3. (Constraint 3 satisfied.)

19. Now in room_3. Need to move grey_box_1 to room_3.

But grey_box_1 is in room_2. So after dropping yellow_box_1:

20. gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_2.

21. gotoroom room_1 room_2 blue_door_1.

22. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_2.

23. pick grey_box_1 room_2.

24. gotoroom room_2 room_1 blue_door_1.

25. gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_2.

26. drop grey_box_1 room_3. (Constraint 7 satisfied.)

Now, after all that, need to go to room_4 to satisfy constraint 4 (if not already done).

But earlier steps (steps 14-17) handled blue_door_3 and purple_ball_1.

Wait, in the earlier steps, after step 13, the steps for blue_door_3 and purple_ball_1 were steps 14-17. Let's see:

After step 13 (green_box_1 in room_2):

14. goto blue_door_3 (room_2).

15. toggle it (unlock).

16. go to room_4.

17. goto purple_ball_1 (constraint 4).

18. return to room_2.

Then proceed to pick yellow_box_1 and move it.

So integrating all:

Steps after 13:

14. gotodoor blue_door_3 room_2 room_4.

15. toggle blue_door_3. (Unlock.)

16. gotoroom room_2 room_4 blue_door_3. (In room_4.)

17. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4. (Constraint 4.)

18. gotoroom room_4 room_2 blue_door_3. (Back to room_2.)

19. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_2.

20. pick yellow_box_1 room_2.

21. gotoroom room_2 room_1 blue_door_1.

22. gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_2.

23. drop yellow_box_1 room_3. (Constraint 3.)

24. gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_2.

25. gotoroom room_1 room_2 blue_door_1.

26. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_2.

27. pick grey_box_1 room_2.

28. gotoroom room_2 room_1 blue_door_1.

29. gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_2.

30. drop grey_box_1 room_3. (Constraint 7.)

Now, finally, need to be in front of a yellow ball. The easiest way is to go back to room_2 and pick up yellow_ball_1, then drop it.

But let's see:

31. gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_2.

32. gotoroom room_1 room_2 blue_door_1.

33. gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2.

34. pick yellow_ball_1 room_2.

35. drop yellow_ball_1 room_2. (Now in front of it, goal achieved.)

But this results in a very long plan. But the problem asks for an optimal plan, which is the shortest possible. So perhaps there's a shorter way.

Let me think of a more optimal path.

Alternative approach:

Use the fact that moving green_box_1 to room_2 requires passing through rooms, and maybe combine some steps.

For example:

After unlocking doors and moving green_box_1 to room_2, when returning to room_3 to unlock green_door_1 and move other boxes, perhaps also handle the purple_ball_1 visit.

But I'm not sure. Let's count the steps in the previous approach:

Total steps: 35. That's way too long. There must be a shorter way.

Alternative idea: Instead of moving grey_box_1, rely on the other condition of constraint 7: empty is in room_1. But since empty_0 is an object of type empty, and it's not mentioned in the initial state, maybe it's not in any room. So the only way is to move grey_box_1. So that step is necessary.

Another idea: Combine the movement of grey_box_1 and yellow_box_1.

After dropping green_box_1 in room_2, pick up both grey_box_1 and yellow_box_1 in two trips.

But each requires two trips.

Wait, but maybe after moving green_box_1 to room_2, when returning to room_2, pick up both objects in sequence.

But each pick requires being in front of the object and not holding anything. So after dropping green_box_1, we can:

14. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_2.

15. pick grey_box_1 room_2.

16. take it to room_3 and drop.

17. return to room_2, pick yellow_box_1.

18. take it to room_3 and drop.

But each trip requires going through room_1 and room_3.

Alternatively, after moving green_box_1 to room_2, then go to blue_door_3, unlock it, go to room_4, satisfy constraint 4, then return to room_2, pick grey_box_1 and yellow_box_1.

But this still adds steps.

Perhaps the optimal plan is around 20 steps. Let's try to find a shorter path.

Let's think about the critical path:

- Unlock blue_door_1, blue_door_2, green_door_1, and blue_door_3.

- Move green_box_1 to room_2.

- Move yellow_box_1 and grey_box_1 to room_3.

- Visit room_4 to be in front of purple_ball_1.

- Be in front of blue_door_3.

- Hold an object.

- Be in room_1.

- Ensure all constraints are met.

Alternative plan:

1. room_2: gotodoor blue_door_1, toggle, unlock (steps 1-3).

2. go to room_1 (step 4).

3. gotodoor blue_door_2, toggle, unlock (steps 5-6).

4. go to room_3 (step7).

5. gotodoor green_door_1, toggle, unlock (steps8-9).

6. goto green_box_1, pick (steps9-10).

7. return to room_2 via room_1, drop green_box_1 (steps11-13).

8. goto blue_door_3, toggle, unlock (steps14-15).

9. go to room_4, goto purple_ball_1 (steps16-17).

10. return to room_2 (step18).

11. pick yellow_box_1 (steps19-20).

12. take to room_3, drop (steps21-23).

13. return to room_2, pick grey_box_1 (steps24-25).

14. take to room_3, drop (steps26-28).

15. go back to room_2, pick yellow_ball_1, drop (steps29-30).

This is still around 30 steps. Not optimal.

Wait, perhaps some constraints can be satisfied in fewer steps.

For example, constraint 6 requires being in front of green_box_1 and green_door_1 is unlocked. When we pick green_box_1 in room_3, we are in front of it, and green_door_1 was just unlocked. So steps 9 (toggle green_door_1), then step 10 (goto green_box_1), step 11 (pick). So at step 10, constraint 6 is satisfied.

Constraint 3 requires being in room_3 and yellow_box_1 there. So when we drop yellow_box_1 in room_3, we are in room_3 and it's there.

Constraint 7: grey_box_1 in room_3.

Constraint 4: in front of purple_ball_1.

Constraint 2: in front of blue_door_3.

Constraint 5: in room_1.

Constraint 8: blue_door_1 unlocked.

Constraint 9: green_box_1 in room_2.

Constraint 1: holding green_box_1, yellow_box_1, or grey_box_1.

Now, can we satisfy multiple constraints with the same action?

For example, unlocking blue_door_1 satisfies constraint 8. Going to room_1 satisfies constraint 5.

When moving green_box_1 to room_2, that's step13 (drop). This satisfies constraint9.

When in room_3 after unlocking green_door_1 and being in front of green_box_1, that satisfies constraint6.

When in front of blue_door_3 in step14, that's constraint2.

When in front of purple_ball_1 in step17, constraint4.

When grey_box_1 is dropped in room_3, constraint7.

Holding objects during steps10, 20,25 satisfies constraint1 multiple times.

Now, the final step is to be in front of a yellow ball. The easiest way is to pick up yellow_ball_1 in room_2 and drop it there.

But during the plan, we have to go back to room_2 after moving grey_box_1 and yellow_box_1.

Alternatively, after dropping grey_box_1 in room_3, go back to room_2 and handle the final goal.

So steps:

After step28 (drop grey_box_1 in room_3):

29. gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_2.

30. gotoroom room_1 room_2 blue_door_1.

31. gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2.

32. pick yellow_ball_1 room_2.

33. drop yellow_ball_1 room_2.

This satisfies the goal.

But this is 33 steps. There must be a shorter way.

Alternative idea: After moving green_box_1 to room_2, and handling blue_door_3 and purple_ball_1, perhaps use the trip to room_4 to also move grey_box_1 and yellow_box_1 via other doors. But the doors are arranged such that room_4 is connected to room_2 and room_3. So from room_4, you can go to room_2 via blue_door_3, or room_3 via green_door_1.

But moving objects from room_2 to room_3 via room_4 would require:

room_2 -> room_4 via blue_door_3 -> room_3 via green_door_1.

But that's possible if the doors are unlocked.

But in the current plan, blue_door_3 and green_door_1 are unlocked. So after step17 (in room_4), instead of returning to room_2, go to room_3 via green_door_1, drop purple_ball_1 (if needed), but that's not necessary. Alternatively, pick up grey_box_1 and yellow_box_1 in room_2, take them through room_4 to room_3.

But how:

After step17 (in room_4):

18. gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1.

19. drop any object if carrying, but not needed.

Then go to room_2 via room_4:

20. gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_1.

21. gotoroom room_4 room_2 blue_door_3.

22. pick yellow_box_1.

23. gotoroom room_2 room_4 blue_door_3.

24. gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1.

25. drop yellow_box_1 in room_3.

But this is more steps. Not sure.

Alternatively, after step17 (in room_4), go back to room_2 via blue_door_3, pick up grey_box_1 and yellow_box_1, then go to room_3 via room_1 and room_2.

But this is similar to previous steps.

I think the initial long plan is unavoidable due to the numerous constraints. Therefore, the optimal plan will have many steps, but perhaps there's a way to combine some.

Wait, perhaps when moving green_box_1 to room_2, we can also move grey_box_1 in the same trip. But we can't carry two objects at once. So no.

Another idea: After dropping green_box_1 in room_2 (step13), pick up grey_box_1 and take it to room_3, then return to room_2 to pick up yellow_box_1. This would require:

13. drop green_box_1 in room_2.

14. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_2.

15. pick grey_box_1 room_2.

16. gotoroom room_2 room_1 blue_door_1.

17. gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_2.

18. drop grey_box_1 room_3. (constraint7)

19. gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_2.

20. gotoroom room_1 room_2 blue_door_1.

21. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_2.

22. pick yellow_box_1 room_2.

23. gotoroom room_2 room_1 blue_door_1.

24. gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_2.

25. drop yellow_box_1 room_3. (constraint3)

Then proceed to handle blue_door_3 and purple_ball_1.

This is 25 steps up to here. Then:

26. gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_2.

27. gotoroom room_1 room_2 blue_door_1.

28. gotodoor blue_door_3 room_2 room_4.

29. toggle blue_door_3.

30. gotoroom room_2 room_4 blue_door_3.

31. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4. (constraint4)

32. gotoroom room_4 room_2 blue_door_3.

33. gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2.

34. pick yellow_ball_1 room_2.

35. drop yellow_ball_1 room_2.

Now, total 35 steps. Still long.

Alternative idea: After step25 (yellow_box_1 in room_3), go to room_4 via green_door_1 (already unlocked) to satisfy constraint4, then return to room_3, then go to room_1 and back to room_2.

But this adds steps.

I think given the constraints, the plan must be lengthy. However, perhaps there's a smarter way to satisfy multiple constraints in fewer steps.

For example, when in room_3 after dropping yellow_box_1 (step25), can go to room_4 to satisfy constraint4, then return to room_3 and proceed to drop grey_box_1.

But I'm not seeing a way to shorten this.

Perhaps the optimal plan is as follows:

```
gotoobject blue_door_1 room_2
toggle blue_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_1 blue_door_1
gotodoor blue_door_2 room_1 room_3
toggle blue_door_2
gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_2
gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4
toggle green_door_1
gotoobject green_box_1 room_3
pick green_box_1 room_3
gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_2
gotoroom room_1 room_2 blue_door_1
drop green_box_1 room_2
gotodoor blue_door_3 room_2 room_4
toggle blue_door_3
gotoroom room_2 room_4 blue_door_3
gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4
gotoroom room_4 room_2 blue_door_3
gotoobject grey_box_1 room_2
pick grey_box_1 room_2
gotoroom room_2 room_1 blue_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_2
drop grey_box_1 room_3
gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_2
pick yellow_box_1 room_2
gotoroom room_2 room_1 blue_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_2
drop yellow_box_1 room_3
gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_2
gotoroom room_1 room_2 blue_door_1
gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2
pick yellow_ball_1 room_2
drop yellow_ball_1 room_2
```

But this plan includes all necessary steps. Let's check if all constraints are met:

- Constraint1: Holding green_box_1, grey_box_1, yellow_box_1, yellow_ball_1. Yes.

- Constraint2: gotodoor blue_door_3 room_2 room_4. Yes.

- Constraint3: drop yellow_box_1 room_3. Yes.

- Constraint4: gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4. Yes.

- Constraint5: gotoroom room_2 room_1 blue_door_1. Yes.

- Constraint6: gotoobject green_box_1 room_3 after unlocking green_door_1. Yes.

- Constraint7: drop grey_box_1 room_3. Yes.

- Constraint8: toggle blue_door_1. Yes.

- Constraint9: drop green_box_1 room_2. Yes.

Final steps: pick and drop yellow_ball_1 to be in front of it.

This plan has 29 steps, but perhaps some steps can be optimized.

Wait, after dropping green_box_1 in room_2 (step 12), the next steps are:

13. gotodoor blue_door_3 room_2 room_4.

14. toggle blue_door_3.

15. gotoroom room_2 room_4 blue_door_3.

16. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4.

17. gotoroom room_4 room_2 blue_door_3.

18. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_2.

19. pick grey_box_1 room_2.

20. gotoroom room_2 room_1 blue_door_1.

21. gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_2.

22. drop grey_box_1 room_3.

23. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_2.

24. pick yellow_box_1 room_2.

25. gotoroom room_2 room_1 blue_door_1.

26. gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_2.

27. drop yellow_box_1 room_3.

28. gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_2.

29. gotoroom room_1 room_2 blue_door_1.

30. gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2.

31. pick yellow_ball_1 room_2.

32. drop yellow_ball_1 room_2.

That's 32 steps. But maybe there's a way to merge some steps.

For example, after dropping grey_box_1 in room_3 (step22), instead of returning to room_2 to pick yellow_box_1, perhaps go directly from room_3 to room_1 and room_2, but that's the same path.

Alternatively, after dropping grey_box_1, go to room_1 and then to room_2 to pick yellow_box_1.

But this is necessary.

Given the complexity, this might be the optimal plan given the constraints.
