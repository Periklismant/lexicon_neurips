Let's break down the problem.

The goal is: "There is a ball v such that "The following conditions are all true: "v is yellow", "you are in front of v"""

So I need to end up standing in front of a yellow ball. There are two yellow balls in this world: yellow_ball_1 (in room_2) and yellow_ball_2 (in room_3).

There are also constraints that need to be satisfied at some point during the plan execution:

1. "you are holding some object"
2. "you are in front of blue_door_3"
3. "The following conditions are all true: "you are in room_3", "yellow_box_1 is in room_3""
4. "At least one of the following conditions is true: "you are in front of purple_ball_1", "green_box_1 is in room_4""
5. "you are in room_1"
6. "The following conditions are all true: "you are in front of green_box_1", "green_door_1 is not locked""
7. "At least one of the following conditions is true: "empty is in room_1", "grey_box_1 is in room_3""
8. "blue_door_1 is not locked"
9. "green_box_1 is in room_2"

So my plan needs to achieve all of these at some point. 

Let's think about how to structure the plan. I start in room_2, and there's a yellow ball (yellow_ball_1) already there. I could simply go to it to satisfy the goal, but I need to make sure all the constraints are also satisfied.

Constraint 3 requires yellow_box_1 to be in room_3, but yellow_box_1 starts in room_2. 
Constraint 9 requires green_box_1 to be in room_2, but green_box_1 starts in room_3.

This suggests I'll need to move at least these two objects between rooms.

Constraint 4 requires either being in front of purple_ball_1 or having green_box_1 in room_4. Since I need green_box_1 to be in room_2 for constraint 9, I'll probably need to stand in front of purple_ball_1 at some point.

Let's start building a plan:

Initial state: in room_2, and there are several objects including yellow_ball_1, which I could use to satisfy the goal.

First, I need to unlock all the doors I'll need to use. The doors connecting room_2 to room_1 (blue_door_1) and room_2 to room_4 (blue_door_3) are relevant initially since I start in room_2.

1. First, I'll go to blue_door_1, toggle it, and go to room_1 to satisfy constraint 5 and 8.
2. Then I'll go back to room_2.
3. I'll go to blue_door_3, toggle it, and go to room_4 to satisfy constraint 2.
4. In room_4, I can go in front of purple_ball_1 to satisfy constraint 4.
5. Then I'll go to green_door_1, toggle it, and go to room_3.
6. In room_3, I can pick up green_box_1 to satisfy constraint 1.
7. I'll go back to room_4, then to room_2, and drop green_box_1 to satisfy constraint 9.
8. Now I'll pick up yellow_box_1 from room_2, go to room_4, room_3, and drop it to satisfy constraint 3.
9. While in room_3, I can go in front of green_box_1 (which should still be there) to satisfy constraint 6 (green_door_1 is already unlocked).
10. I can also pick up grey_box_1 in room_2 and drop it in room_3 to satisfy constraint 7.
11. Finally, I can go to room_2 or room_3 (whichever is more convenient based on the previous steps) and go in front of a yellow ball to satisfy the goal.

Let's try to write down this plan more precisely, keeping track of the state of the world.

Wait, there's a concern here. I noticed that green_box_1 starts in room_3 and I need it to be both in room_2 (constraint 9) and to stand in front of it while green_door_1 is unlocked (constraint 6). Let me confirm whether I need these to be simultaneously true or if they can be satisfied at different points in the plan...

It seems that the constraints only need to be satisfied at some point during the plan, not necessarily simultaneously. This means I can have green_box_1 in room_3, go in front of it with green_door_1 unlocked to satisfy constraint 6, and then move it to room_2 to satisfy constraint 9.

Let's refine the plan:

1. Go to blue_door_1, toggle it, go to room_1 (satisfies constraints 5 and 8).
2. Go back to room_2.
3. Go to blue_door_3, toggle it (satisfies constraint 2).
4. Go to room_4.
5. Go in front of purple_ball_1 (satisfies constraint 4).
6. Go to green_door_1, toggle it.
7. Go to room_3.
8. Go in front of green_box_1, with green_door_1 unlocked (satisfies constraint 6).
9. Pick up green_box_1 (satisfies constraint 1).
10. Go back to room_4, then to room_2.
11. Drop green_box_1 (satisfies constraint 9).
12. Pick up yellow_box_1.
13. Go to room_4, then to room_3.
14. Drop yellow_box_1 (satisfies constraint 3).
15. Pick up grey_box_1 from room_2 and drop it in room_3 (satisfies constraint 7). (Actually, I realize I need to go back to room_2 first to pick up grey_box_1)
16. Go back to room_2, pick up grey_box_1.
17. Go to room_4, then to room_3.
18. Drop grey_box_1 (satisfies constraint 7).
19. Go to room_2.
20. Go in front of yellow_ball_1 (satisfies the goal).

Let me refine this a bit more into the exact action format the problem specifies.

Wait, there's an issue with step 15. I mentioned picking up grey_box_1 from room_2, but grey_box_1 is in room_2 at the start, not room_3. Let me fix that.

Actually, let me just write out the full plan now with the proper action format:

1. `gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1` - Go in front of the door connecting room_2 and room_1.
2. `toggle blue_door_1` - Unlock the door.
3. `gotoroom room_2 room_1 blue_door_1` - Go to room_1.
4. `gotoroom room_1 room_2 blue_door_1` - Go back to room_2.
5. `gotodoor blue_door_3 room_2 room_4` - Go in front of the door connecting room_2 and room_4.
6. `toggle blue_door_3` - Unlock the door.
7. `gotoroom room_2 room_4 blue_door_3` - Go to room_4.
8. `gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4` - Go in front of purple_ball_1.
9. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3` - Go in front of the door connecting room_4 and room_3.
10. `toggle green_door_1` - Unlock the door.
11. `gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1` - Go to room_3.
12. `gotoobject green_box_1 room_3` - Go in front of green_box_1.
13. `pick green_box_1 room_3` - Pick up green_box_1.
14. `gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_1` - Go back to room_4.
15. `gotoroom room_4 room_2 blue_door_3` - Go to room_2.
16. `gotoempty` - Go in front of an empty position.
17. `drop green_box_1 room_2` - Drop green_box_1.
18. `gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_2` - Go in front of yellow_box_1.
19. `pick yellow_box_1 room_2` - Pick up yellow_box_1.
20. `gotoroom room_2 room_4 blue_door_3` - Go to room_4.
21. `gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1` - Go to room_3.
22. `gotoempty` - Go in front of an empty position.
23. `drop yellow_box_1 room_3` - Drop yellow_box_1.
24. `gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_1` - Go back to room_4.
25. `gotoroom room_4 room_2 blue_door_3` - Go to room_2.
26. `gotoobject grey_box_1 room_2` - Go in front of grey_box_1.
27. `pick grey_box_1 room_2` - Pick up grey_box_1.
28. `gotoroom room_2 room_4 blue_door_3` - Go to room_4.
29. `gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1` - Go to room_3.
30. `gotoempty` - Go in front of an empty position.
31. `drop grey_box_1 room_3` - Drop grey_box_1.
32. `gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_1` - Go back to room_4.
33. `gotoroom room_4 room_2 blue_door_3` - Go to room_2.
34. `gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2` - Go in front of yellow_ball_1.

But wait, I need to go through the constraints again to verify that my plan satisfies all of them:

1. "you are holding some object" - Satisfied when I pick up green_box_1, yellow_box_1, and grey_box_1.
2. "you are in front of blue_door_3" - Satisfied when I go in front of blue_door_3.
3. "The following conditions are all true: "you are in room_3", "yellow_box_1 is in room_3"" - Satisfied after I drop yellow_box_1 in room_3.
4. "At least one of the following conditions is true: "you are in front of purple_ball_1", "green_box_1 is in room_4"" - Satisfied when I go in front of purple_ball_1 in room_4.
5. "you are in room_1" - Satisfied when I go to room_1.
6. "The following conditions are all true: "you are in front of green_box_1", "green_door_1 is not locked"" - Satisfied when I go in front of green_box_1 in room_3 after unlocking green_door_1.
7. "At least one of the following conditions is true: "empty is in room_1", "grey_box_1 is in room_3"" - Satisfied after I drop grey_box_1 in room_3.
8. "blue_door_1 is not locked" - Satisfied after I toggle blue_door_1.
9. "green_box_1 is in room_2" - Satisfied after I drop green_box_1 in room_2.

I'm still missing one constraint: "you are in room_1" (constraint 5). Let me add that to my plan... Actually, I already have that in steps 1-3. I go to blue_door_1, toggle it, and then go to room_1.

Actually, let me double-check the initial state again. I start in room_2 and there's a yellow ball (yellow_ball_1) there. The goal is to be in front of a yellow ball (any yellow ball). There's no need to move around. I could just go straight to yellow_ball_1 and that would fulfill the goal. But I still need to check that all constraints are satisfied.

Let me check if there's a more efficient plan.

1. `gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2` - Go in front of yellow_ball_1 to satisfy the goal.
2. `gotoempty` - Move away from the yellow ball to prepare for the next step.
3. `gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1` - Go in front of the door connecting room_2 and room_1.
4. `toggle blue_door_1` - Unlock the door to satisfy constraint 8.
5. `gotoroom room_2 room_1 blue_door_1` - Go to room_1 to satisfy constraint 5.
6. `gotoroom room_1 room_2 blue_door_1` - Go back to room_2.
7. `gotodoor blue_door_3 room_2 room_4` - Go in front of the door connecting room_2 and room_4 to satisfy constraint 2.
8. `toggle blue_door_3` - Unlock the door.
9. `gotoroom room_2 room_4 blue_door_3` - Go to room_4.
10. `gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4` - Go in front of purple_ball_1 to satisfy constraint 4.
11. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3` - Go in front of the door connecting room_4 and room_3.
12. `toggle green_door_1` - Unlock the door.
13. `gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1` - Go to room_3.
14. `gotoobject green_box_1 room_3` - Go in front of green_box_1.
15. `pick green_box_1 room_3` - Pick up green_box_1 to satisfy constraint 1 and constraint 6 (since green_door_1 is unlocked).
16. `gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_1` - Go back to room_4.
17. `gotoroom room_4 room_2 blue_door_3` - Go to room_2.
18. `gotoempty` - Go in front of an empty position.
19. `drop green_box_1 room_2` - Drop green_box_1 to satisfy constraint 9.
20. `gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_2` - Go in front of yellow_box_1.
21. `pick yellow_box_1 room_2` - Pick up yellow_box_1.
22. `gotoroom room_2 room_4 blue_door_3` - Go to room_4.
23. `gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1` - Go to room_3.
24. `gotoempty` - Go in front of an empty position.
25. `drop yellow_box_1 room_3` - Drop yellow_box_1 to satisfy constraint 3.
26. `gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_1` - Go back to room_4.
27. `gotoroom room_4 room_2 blue_door_3` - Go to room_2.
28. `gotoobject grey_box_1 room_2` - Go in front of grey_box_1.
29. `pick grey_box_1 room_2` - Pick up grey_box_1.
30. `gotoroom room_2 room_4 blue_door_3` - Go to room_4.
31. `gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1` - Go to room_3.
32. `gotoempty` - Go in front of an empty position.
33. `drop grey_box_1 room_3` - Drop grey_box_1 to satisfy constraint 7.
34. `gotoobject yellow_ball_2 room_3` - Go in front of yellow_ball_2 to satisfy the goal again (in case the previous goal satisfaction was invalidated).

This plan should satisfy all constraints and the goal. However, it's not optimal because I'm moving around a lot. Let me see if I can optimize it more by reducing the number of times I go between rooms.

Actually, there's a way to reduce the plan by making one observation: the goal is "There is a ball v such that "The following conditions are all true: "v is yellow", "you are in front of v"", and there are two yellow balls: yellow_ball_1 in room_2 and yellow_ball_2 in room_3. So we could finish the plan by being in front of either one. 

Let me try to rearrange the plan to be more efficient:

1. `gotodoor blue_door_3 room_2 room_4` - Go in front of the door connecting room_2 and room_4 to satisfy constraint 2.
2. `toggle blue_door_3` - Unlock the door.
3. `gotoroom room_2 room_4 blue_door_3` - Go to room_4.
4. `gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4` - Go in front of purple_ball_1 to satisfy constraint 4.
5. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3` - Go in front of the door connecting room_4 and room_3.
6. `toggle green_door_1` - Unlock the door.
7. `gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1` - Go to room_3.
8. `gotoobject green_box_1 room_3` - Go in front of green_box_1.
9. `pick green_box_1 room_3` - Pick up green_box_1 to satisfy constraint 1 and constraint 6 (since green_door_1 is unlocked).
10. `gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_1` - Go back to room_4.
11. `gotoroom room_4 room_2 blue_door_3` - Go to room_2.
12. `gotoempty` - Go in front of an empty position.
13. `drop green_box_1 room_2` - Drop green_box_1 to satisfy constraint 9.
14. `gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1` - Go in front of the door connecting room_2 and room_1.
15. `toggle blue_door_1` - Unlock the door to satisfy constraint 8.
16. `gotoroom room_2 room_1 blue_door_1` - Go to room_1 to satisfy constraint 5.
17. `gotoroom room_1 room_2 blue_door_1` - Go back to room_2.
18. `gotoobject grey_box_1 room_2` - Go in front of grey_box_1.
19. `pick grey_box_1 room_2` - Pick up grey_box_1.
20. `gotoroom room_2 room_4 blue_door_3` - Go to room_4.
21. `gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1` - Go to room_3.
22. `gotoempty` - Go in front of an empty position.
23. `drop grey_box_1 room_3` - Drop grey_box_1 to satisfy constraint 7.
24. `gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_2` - Go in front of yellow_box_1. (wait, I'm in room_3 now, but yellow_box_1 is in room_2).

I need to go back to room_2 to pick up yellow_box_1:

24. `gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_1` - Go back to room_4.
25. `gotoroom room_4 room_2 blue_door_3` - Go to room_2.
26. `gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_2` - Go in front of yellow_box_1.
27. `pick yellow_box_1 room_2` - Pick up yellow_box_1.
28. `gotoroom room_2 room_4 blue_door_3` - Go to room_4.
29. `gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1` - Go to room_3.
30. `gotoempty` - Go in front of an empty position.
31. `drop yellow_box_1 room_3` - Drop yellow_box_1 to satisfy constraint 3.
32. `gotoobject yellow_ball_2 room_3` - Go in front of yellow_ball_2 to satisfy the goal.

Actually, I see a simpler plan:

1. `gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1` - Go in front of the door connecting room_2 and room_1.
2. `toggle blue_door_1` - Unlock the door to satisfy constraint 8.
3. `gotoroom room_2 room_1 blue_door_1` - Go to room_1 to satisfy constraint 5.
4. `gotoroom room_1 room_2 blue_door_1` - Go back to room_2.
5. `gotodoor blue_door_3 room_2 room_4` - Go in front of the door connecting room_2 and room_4 to satisfy constraint 2.
6. `toggle blue_door_3` - Unlock the door.
7. `gotoroom room_2 room_4 blue_door_3` - Go to room_4.
8. `gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4` - Go in front of purple_ball_1 to satisfy constraint 4.
9. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3` - Go in front of the door connecting room_4 and room_3.
10. `toggle green_door_1` - Unlock the door.
11. `gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1` - Go to room_3.
12. `gotoobject green_box_1 room_3` - Go in front of green_box_1.
13. `pick green_box_1 room_3` - Pick up green_box_1 to satisfy constraint 1 and constraint 6 (since green_door_1 is unlocked).
14. `gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_1` - Go back to room_4.
15. `gotoroom room_4 room_2 blue_door_3` - Go to room_2.
16. `gotoempty` - Go in front of an empty position.
17. `drop green_box_1 room_2` - Drop green_box_1 to satisfy constraint 9.
18. `gotoobject grey_box_1 room_2` - Go in front of grey_box_1.
19. `pick grey_box_1 room_2` - Pick up grey_box_1.
20. `gotoroom room_2 room_4 blue_door_3` - Go to room_4.
21. `gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1` - Go to room_3.
22. `gotoempty` - Go in front of an empty position.
23. `drop grey_box_1 room_3` - Drop grey_box_1 to satisfy constraint 7.
24. `gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_1` - Go back to room_4.
25. `gotoroom room_4 room_2 blue_door_3` - Go to room_2.
26. `gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_2` - Go in front of yellow_box_1.
27. `pick yellow_box_1 room_2` - Pick up yellow_box_1.
28. `gotoroom room_2 room_4 blue_door_3` - Go to room_4.
29. `gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1` - Go to room_3.
30. `gotoempty` - Go in front of an empty position.
31. `drop yellow_box_1 room_3` - Drop yellow_box_1 to satisfy constraint 3.
32. `gotoobject yellow_ball_2 room_3` - Go in front of yellow_ball_2 to satisfy the goal.

Let me review this plan once more.

... Reviewing, I'm not seeing any ways to substantially optimize it further. The plan requires moving between rooms several times because of the interrelated constraints. In each journey between rooms, I make efficient use by carrying objects that need to be relocated. The plan satisfies all the constraints and ends with me in front of a yellow ball (yellow_ball_2), thus satisfying the goal. So I think this is the correct plan.

Actually, I just realized that the plan can be slightly simplified. The goal is to be in front of a yellow ball, and yellow_ball_1 is already in room_2 where I start. So I could just go in front of yellow_ball_1 at the very end, saving a few steps.

Let me once more check all the constraints against this simpler plan:

1. "you are holding some object" - Satisfied when I pick up green_box_1, grey_box_1, or yellow_box_1.
2. "you are in front of blue_door_3" - Satisfied in step 5.
3. "The following conditions are all true: "you are in room_3", "yellow_box_1 is in room_3"" - Satisfied after step 31.
4. "At least one of the following conditions is true: "you are in front of purple_ball_1", "green_box_1 is in room_4"" - Satisfied in step 8.
5. "you are in room_1" - Satisfied in step 3.
6. "The following conditions are all true: "you are in front of green_box_1", "green_door_1 is not locked"" - Satisfied after steps 12 and 10.
7. "At least one of the following conditions is true: "empty is in room_1", "grey_box_1 is in room_3"" - Satisfied after step 23.
8. "blue_door_1 is not locked" - Satisfied after step 2.
9. "green_box_1 is in room_2" - Satisfied after step 17.

So even with the simplifications, the plan satisfies all the constraints and ends with me in front of a yellow ball, thus satisfying the goal. I think this is the optimal plan.

Let me make one final check to see if I can optimize a bit more:

1. `gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1` - Go in front of the door connecting room_2 and room_1.
2. `toggle blue_door_1` - Unlock the door to satisfy constraint 8.
3. `gotoroom room_2 room_1 blue_door_1` - Go to room_1 to satisfy constraint 5.
4. `gotoroom room_1 room_2 blue_door_1` - Go back to room_2.

Since I'm in room_2, I need to move green_box_1 from room_3 to room_2, move grey_box_1 from room_2 to room_3, and move yellow_box_1 from room_2 to room_3. I'll go to room_3 via room_4, doing some of the other constraints along the way:

5. `gotodoor blue_door_3 room_2 room_4` - Go in front of the door connecting room_2 and room_4 to satisfy constraint 2.
6. `toggle blue_door_3` - Unlock the door.
7. `gotoroom room_2 room_4 blue_door_3` - Go to room_4.
8. `gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4` - Go in front of purple_ball_1 to satisfy constraint 4.
9. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3` - Go in front of the door connecting room_4 and room_3.
10. `toggle green_door_1` - Unlock the door.
11. `gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1` - Go to room_3.
12. `gotoobject green_box_1 room_3` - Go in front of green_box_1.
13. `pick green_box_1 room_3` - Pick up green_box_1 to satisfy constraint 1 and constraint 6 (since green_door_1 is unlocked).
14. `gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_1` - Go back to room_4.
15. `gotoroom room_4 room_2 blue_door_3` - Go to room_2.
16. `gotoempty` - Go in front of an empty position.
17. `drop green_box_1 room_2` - Drop green_box_1 to satisfy constraint 9.

I've now moved green_box_1 from room_3 to room_2. Next, I'll move grey_box_1 from room_2 to room_3:

18. `gotoobject grey_box_1 room_2` - Go in front of grey_box_1.
19. `pick grey_box_1 room_2` - Pick up grey_box_1.
20. `gotoroom room_2 room_4 blue_door_3` - Go to room_4.
21. `gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1` - Go to room_3.
22. `gotoempty` - Go in front of an empty position.
23. `drop grey_box_1 room_3` - Drop grey_box_1 to satisfy constraint 7.

I've now moved grey_box_1 from room_2 to room_3. Next, I'll move yellow_box_1 from room_2 to room_3:

24. `gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_1` - Go back to room_4.
25. `gotoroom room_4 room_2 blue_door_3` - Go to room_2.
26. `gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_2` - Go in front of yellow_box_1.
27. `pick yellow_box_1 room_2` - Pick up yellow_box_1.
28. `gotoroom room_2 room_4 blue_door_3` - Go to room_4.
29. `gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1` - Go to room_3.
30. `gotoempty` - Go in front of an empty position.
31. `drop yellow_box_1 room_3` - Drop yellow_box_1 to satisfy constraint 3.

I've now moved yellow_box_1 from room_2 to room_3. To satisfy the goal, I'll go in front of a yellow ball. Since both yellow_ball_1 (in room_2) and yellow_ball_2 (in room_3) are yellow, I'll go in front of yellow_ball_2 since I'm already in room_3:

32. `gotoobject yellow_ball_2 room_3` - Go in front of yellow_ball_2 to satisfy the goal.

Wait, I just realized I made a mistake. In the process of checking the constraints, I got confused thinking that step 12 was about "going in front of green_box_1 with green_door_1 unlocked," but in fact that's satisfied by steps 10-12. So the constraint check is still valid.

So my final plan is:

1. `gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1` - Go in front of the door connecting room_2 and room_1.
2. `toggle blue_door_1` - Unlock the door to satisfy constraint 8.
3. `gotoroom room_2 room_1 blue_door_1` - Go to room_1 to satisfy constraint 5.
4. `gotoroom room_1 room_2 blue_door_1` - Go back to room_2.
5. `gotodoor blue_door_3 room_2 room_4` - Go in front of the door connecting room_2 and room_4 to satisfy constraint 2.

12. `gotoobject green_box_1 room_3` - Go in front of green_box_1.
13. `pick green_box_1 room_3` - Pick up green_box_1 to satisfy constraint 1 and constraint 6 (since green_door_1 is unlocked).
14. `gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_1` - Go back to room_4.
15. `gotoroom room_4 room_2 blue_door_3` - Go to room_2.
16. `gotoempty` - Go in front of an empty position.
17. `drop green_box_1 room_2` - Drop green_box_1 to satisfy constraint 9.
18. `gotoobject grey_box_1 room_2` - Go in front of grey_box_1.
19. `pick grey_box_1 room_2` - Pick up grey_box_1.
