Okay, let's try to figure out how to solve this planning problem. So the goal is to have a yellow ball that I'm in front of. The initial state says I'm in room_2, and there are several objects in different rooms. Let's start by understanding where the yellow balls are.

Looking at the initial state, yellow_ball_1 is in room_2, and yellow_ball_2 is in room_3. Both are yellow. The purple_ball_1 is in room_4 but that's purple, so not relevant. The blue_ball_1 is blue. So the target is either yellow_ball_1 in room_2 or yellow_ball_2 in room_3.

But the problem is that all doors are locked initially. The doors blue_door_1 (connecting room_1 and 2), blue_door_2 (room_1 and 3), blue_door_3 (room_2 and 4), and green_door_1 (room_3 and 4) are all locked. So I can't move between rooms unless I unlock a door. But to toggle a door, I need to be in front of it, which requires going to the door. But going to a door has a precondition that there's no object blocking the position in front of the door in the current room.

Looking at room_2's objects: yellow_ball_1, grey_box_1, yellow_box_1, grey_box_2. Are any of these blocking the doors? The problem states that objects can block doors if they're in front of them. So in room_2, the doors connected are blue_door_1 (to room_1) and blue_door_3 (to room_4). So I need to check if any objects are blocking those doors. But the initial state doesn't mention anything about objects blocking doors. Wait, the effects of the "drop" action mention that if x was blocking a door, it's no longer blocking. But the initial state doesn't say any objects are blocking doors. So maybe in the initial state, none of the objects are blocking the doors. Therefore, I can go to the doors in room_2.

But wait, the "goto door" action's precondition is (i) you are in a room which door d is connecting with another room, and (ii) no object is blocking the position in front of d. Since the initial state doesn't mention any objects blocking doors, then it's safe to assume that I can go to the doors. So maybe I can go to blue_door_1 in room_2, toggle it to unlock, then go through to room_1. Wait, but the goal is to be in front of a yellow ball. The yellow_ball_1 is already in room_2. So maybe I don't need to move anywhere else. Wait, but I'm in room_2, and yellow_ball_1 is there. So maybe I can just go to the object, pick it up, then drop it again? Wait, no, the goal is to be in front of a yellow ball. If I'm already in room_2, can I just go to yellow_ball_1?

Wait, the initial state says I'm in room_2. The "gotoobject x r" action requires that I'm in the same room as x. Since yellow_ball_1 is in room_2, I can perform "gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2". After that, I would be in front of yellow_ball_1, which satisfies the goal. So why isn't that the solution? Because the doors are locked, but maybe I don't need to go through any doors. Wait, but the problem is that the initial state may have me in room_2, but maybe I'm not in front of the yellow_ball_1 yet. So the initial position is just being in the room, but not in front of any object. So the first step would be to "gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2". Then, the goal is achieved.

But wait, let me check the preconditions for "gotoobject". The preconditions are that I'm in the same room as x. Since I'm in room_2 and yellow_ball_1 is in room_2, that's satisfied. So the action "gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2" would make me in front of it. Then the goal is met. So why isn't the plan just that single action?

But maybe there's a constraint I'm missing. The problem mentions that there are constraints the plan must abide by, but the user didn't list them here. Wait, looking back at the problem statement: "A valid plan for the abovementioned problem must abide by the following constraints:" but then the user didn't paste the constraints. Wait, looking at the original problem statement again. Oh, wait, the user provided the problem, but in the copy-paste, maybe the constraints were omitted. Let me check again.

Wait, the user's problem statement says: "Provided a planning problem, consisting of an initial state of the world, a final goal and a set of constraints, your task is to provide a valid sequence of actions that solves the planning problem, i.e., bringing about the goal of the problem while satisfying all constraints."

But in the problem data provided, the constraints section is empty. Wait, looking at the user input again. After the initial state and the goal, the user wrote: "A valid plan for the abovementioned problem must abide by the following constraints:" but then there's nothing. That's strange. Maybe it's a formatting error. But in the actual problem, perhaps the constraints were omitted. Alternatively, maybe the user intended to include constraints but forgot. But given the information provided, perhaps there are no additional constraints beyond the preconditions and effects of the actions.

Assuming that, then the solution is straightforward. Since the agent is already in room_2 where yellow_ball_1 is located, they can perform "gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2" to be in front of it. That would satisfy the goal of having a yellow ball that the agent is in front of. So the plan is just that single action.

But wait, let me make sure. The initial state says "you have visited room_2". The agent is in room_2. The action "gotoobject" requires that the agent is in the same room as the object, which is true. So performing "gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2" is possible, and after that, the agent is in front of yellow_ball_1. The goal is "There is a ball v such that v is yellow and you are in front of v". So that action achieves the goal. Therefore, the optimal plan is just that one action.

But perhaps there's a catch. For example, maybe the doors being locked prevent moving within the room. But the "gotoobject" action doesn't require the doors to be unlocked because it's within the same room. Doors are for moving between rooms. So the locked doors shouldn't affect moving within the same room. Therefore, the plan should be just the one action.

Wait, but the initial state mentions that all doors are locked. But the agent is in room_2. The doors in room_2 are blue_door_1 (connecting to room_1) and blue_door_3 (connecting to room_4). But if the agent is in room_2 and wants to go to an object in room_2, the doors aren't involved. So the action is possible.

Therefore, the optimal plan is:

```
gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2
```

But let me double-check. Are there any other constraints? For example, maybe the agent starts in front of another object, which would require moving away first. The initial state says "you are not holding any object" but doesn't mention being in front of any object. The effects of the goto actions involve leaving the previous position if you were in front of something. But initially, the agent is just in the room, not in front of anything. So the first action can be to go to the yellow_ball_1. Therefore, the plan is correct.
