Okay, let's try to figure out how to solve this planning problem. So the goal is to have a purple ball in room_4, be in room_4, and be in front of that ball. The initial state says that the purple_ball_1 is already in room_4. So the main challenge is getting the agent to room_4 and in front of that ball. But wait, there are constraints, right? Let me check the constraints again.

Oh right, the constraints aren't listed here, but the problem mentions that the plan must satisfy all constraints. Wait, maybe the constraints are part of the problem description? Let me look back. The user provided the initial state, the goal, and the set of constraints. The constraints are probably in the problem, but in the given input, perhaps the constraints are the door colors and their locked states. Wait, in the original state, all doors are locked. The blue doors 1, 2, 3 and the green door are all locked. So the agent needs to unlock doors to move between rooms.

The agent starts in room_2. The goal is to be in room_4, in front of the purple_ball_1, which is already in room_4. So the steps needed are: get to room_4, unlock the necessary doors, and position in front of the ball.

Let me map out the connections. From room_2, the doors are blue_door_1 connecting to room_1, blue_door_3 connecting to room_4, and maybe others. Wait, looking at the original state:

- room_2 and room_1 are connected via blue_door_1.
- room_2 and room_4 are connected via blue_door_3.
- room_4 and room_3 are connected via green_door_1.

So from room_2, the agent can go to room_1 via blue_door_1 or to room_4 via blue_door_3. But both doors are locked initially. So the agent needs to unlock at least one of these doors to move. But to toggle a door, they need to be in front of it. To get in front of a door, they must be in a room connected by that door, and there's no object blocking the position in front of the door.

Wait, the preconditions for "gotodoor d r1 r2" are that you're in a room connected by d (either r1 or r2) and that there's no object blocking the position in front of d in the current room. So the agent is in room_2. So blue_door_1 connects room_1 and room_2. So in room_2, the agent can go to blue_door_1. But are there any objects blocking that door's position? The initial state says in room_2 there are grey_box_2 and grey_box_3. Are these boxes blocking the door? The problem statement says that objects can block doors if they are in front of them. Wait, the effect of "drop" is that the object is in the room, and if it's blocking a door, then when picked up, it's no longer blocking. But in the initial state, are any boxes blocking doors?

In the initial state, the boxes are in their respective rooms, but we don't know their positions relative to doors. The problem says that "goto door" requires that there's no object blocking the position in front of d in the current room. So if there's an object in front of the door, you can't go there. So if in room_2, the blue_door_3 (connecting to room_4) is present, but if the grey_box_2 or grey_box_3 are in front of it, then the agent can't go to that door. However, the initial state doesn't specify positions of objects relative to doors. Hmm. This is a bit ambiguous. Since the problem doesn't state that any objects are blocking doors, we can assume that they are not blocking. Unless the problem's initial state includes that, but in the given original state, there's no mention of objects blocking doors. So maybe all doors are unblocked.

Assuming that the doors are not blocked, the agent can go to them. So in room_2, the agent can go to blue_door_3 (connecting to room_4), but the door is locked. So the agent needs to toggle it. But to toggle, they need to be in front of the door. So the steps would be: goto door blue_door_3 in room_2 (from room_2), then toggle it to unlock. Then use gotoroom to go to room_4. Then go to the purple_ball_1 in room_4.

Wait, but the purple_ball_1 is in room_4. The agent needs to be in front of it. So once in room_4, the agent needs to perform "gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4". But before that, they need to be in room_4.

So the plan steps would be:

1. In room_2, go to blue_door_3 (which connects room_2 and room_4). The agent is in room_2, so gotodoor blue_door_3 room_2 room_4.

2. Toggle blue_door_3 to unlock it.

3. Use gotoroom to go from room_2 to room_4 via blue_door_3.

4. Now in room_4, go to the purple_ball_1 (gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4).

But wait, the purple_ball_1 is in room_4. The agent is now in room_4. So step 4 is possible.

But let's check preconditions for each action.

First, starting in room_2. The initial state says the agent is in room_2 and has visited it. So first action: gotodoor blue_door_3 room_2 room_4.

Precondition: the agent is in a room connected by blue_door_3 (room_2 is connected via blue_door_3 to room_4), and there's no object blocking the position in front of the door in room_2. Assuming no blocking objects, so this is possible.

After gotodoor, the agent is in front of blue_door_3.

Then toggle blue_door_3: possible because the agent is in front of it.

This unlocks the door. Then, gotoroom room_2 room_4 blue_door_3. Preconditions: the agent is in room_2 (yes), which is adjacent to room_4 via blue_door_3 (yes), and the door is unlocked (yes, after toggle). So this action is possible. After this, the agent is in room_4, and not in front of anything.

Then, the agent needs to go to the purple_ball_1 in room_4. So gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4. Precondition: agent is in room_4 (yes), so allowed. Then, after that, the agent is in front of the purple_ball_1. That satisfies the goal: "There is a ball v (purple_ball_1) such that v is purple, in room_4, agent is in room_4, and in front of v."

So the plan would be:

1. gotodoor blue_door_3 room_2 room_4
2. toggle blue_door_3
3. gotoroom room_2 room_4 blue_door_3
4. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4

But wait, after step 3, the agent is in room_4. Then step 4 is needed to be in front of the ball. Yes.

But the initial state says that the agent is not holding any objects. So no need for pick or drop actions here, since the ball is already in room_4.

So this seems like the minimal plan. Let's check if there are any constraints that would block this.

Wait, the problem says that all doors are locked initially. So the agent must unlock blue_door_3. But to toggle it, they must be in front of it. The steps above do that. Then move through the door.

Alternatively, another path: from room_2, maybe go through room_1 to room_3, then to room_4. But that's longer. The direct path via blue_door_3 is shorter.

Another check: in room_2, after unlocking blue_door_3, the agent can go through. So that's the optimal path.

So the steps are as above. Let me write them in the required format.
