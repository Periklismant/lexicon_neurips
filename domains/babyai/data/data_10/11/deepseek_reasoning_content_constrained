Okay, let me try to figure out how to solve this planning problem. The goal is to get a purple ball into room_4, be in room_4, and be in front of that ball. Also, there are a bunch of constraints to satisfy. Let's break this down step by step.

First, the initial state: I'm in room_2. The purple_ball_1 is already in room_4, so the goal might already be partially satisfied. But I need to be in room_4 and in front of it. Wait, the goal is that there's a ball v (which would be purple_ball_1) in room_4, me in room_4, and in front of it. So maybe the main challenge is getting to room_4 and positioning in front of the ball, but there are constraints to meet along the way.

Now, the constraints. Let's list them:

1. Must be in front of green_door_1 at least once.
2. Must be in room_4 at least once (which is part of the goal).
3. If in room_4 in some state, there must be an earlier state where I was in room_1 or holding grey_box_3.
4. Blue_door_3 must always be locked. So I can't unlock it.
5. Must be in front of blue_door_3 at least once.
6. If I'm in front of blue_door_3, then earlier I must have either blue_door_2 unlocked or holding purple_box_1.
7. Must be in room_3 at least once.
8. Must have grey_box_3 in room_4 at least once.
9. Must be in room_2 at least once (already true in the initial state, but maybe again later).
10. If in room_2 at any state, then I must be holding an object either then or after.
11. At least once, I must be holding some object or specifically purple_box_1.
12. At least once, hold green_box_1.
13. At least once, hold some object.

The constraints complicate things. Let's see:

Starting in room_2. The purple_ball_1 is in room_4. To get to room_4, the doors available from room_2 are blue_door_3 (connecting to room_4) and blue_door_1 (to room_1). But blue_door_3 is locked and must remain locked. So I can't go through blue_door_3. Wait, constraint 4 says blue_door_3 must be locked in every state. So if I ever toggle it, that would violate the constraint. Therefore, blue_door_3 must stay locked. Therefore, I can't use blue_door_3 to get to room_4. So how else can I get to room_4? The other door is green_door_1 connecting room_3 and room_4. So maybe I need to go through room_3 to room_4 via green_door_1. But green_door_1 is initially locked. So I need to unlock it. But to unlock it, I have to be in front of it and toggle it. But green_door_1 is between room_3 and room_4. So I need to get to room_3 first, then to green_door_1, toggle it, then go to room_4.

But how do I get to room_3 from room_2? Looking at the connections: room_2 is connected to room_1 (blue_door_1) and room_4 (blue_door_3). But room_1 is connected to room_3 via blue_door_2. So possible path: room_2 -> room_1 via blue_door_1 (but blue_door_1 is locked), then room_1 to room_3 via blue_door_2 (also locked). So both doors are locked. So I need to unlock them. But to unlock a door, I need to be in front of it. So maybe go to room_1's door (blue_door_1) from room_2. But blue_door_1 is locked. To toggle it, I need to be in front of it.

Wait, initial state: I'm in room_2. The doors in room_2 are blue_door_1 (to room_1) and blue_door_3 (to room_4). Both are locked. So to unlock blue_door_1, I need to go in front of it. But to get in front of it, I need to use the gotodoor action, which requires that there's no object blocking the position in front of the door in my current room. Are there any objects blocking doors in room_2? The initial state has grey_box_2 and grey_box_3 in room_2. Are they blocking doors? The problem statement mentions that objects may block doors. But the initial state doesn't say anything about objects blocking doors. So maybe by default, objects are not blocking unless specified. Wait, the preconditions for gotodoor say: "(ii) there is no object blocking the position in front of d in the room you are currently in." So unless an object is in front of the door, which would block it. But in the initial state, the boxes are in the rooms but not necessarily in front of doors. So maybe in room_2, grey_box_2 and grey_box_3 are not blocking the doors. So I can go in front of blue_door_1 from room_2. Let me check the initial positions of the objects. The problem doesn't specify exact positions, just which room they're in. So perhaps the doors are not blocked by default. So I can use gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1.

So steps:

1. From room_2, go to blue_door_1 (gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1). Then toggle it to unlock. Then go through to room_1.

But wait, to toggle a door, you have to be in front of it. So gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1, then toggle blue_door_1. Then gotoroom room_2 room_1 blue_door_1.

But let's check the constraints. Let's see:

Constraint 4: blue_door_3 must remain locked. So we can't toggle that. Other doors can be toggled as needed.

But after unlocking blue_door_1, we can go to room_1.

Then in room_1, the door to room_3 is blue_door_2. Which is locked. So need to unlock that. So go to blue_door_2 in room_1, toggle it, then go to room_3.

Once in room_3, the door to room_4 is green_door_1, which is locked. Need to unlock it. So go to green_door_1 in room_3, toggle it, then go to room_4.

Once in room_4, go to purple_ball_1, pick it up, and drop it again? Wait, the goal is to be in front of the purple ball in room_4, which is already there. So perhaps just navigating to room_4 and then going to the ball. But the goal is to have the ball in room_4 (which it already is), me in room_4, and in front of it.

So maybe the steps are:

- Get to room_4 via room_3.

But along the way, I need to satisfy all constraints.

Let's check constraints:

Constraint 3: If in room_4, must have been in room_1 or holding grey_box_3 before.

Grey_box_3 is in room_2. So perhaps pick up grey_box_3 in room_2 and carry it, then go to room_4. But how?

Wait, the path would be room_2 -> room_1 via blue_door_1 (unlock it), then room_1 -> room_3 via blue_door_2 (unlock), then room_3 -> room_4 via green_door_1 (unlock). But to carry grey_box_3 from room_2, I need to pick it up. But then I have to carry it through the doors.

But also, constraint 8: grey_box_3 must be in room_4 at least once. So maybe after picking it up in room_2, take it to room_4 and drop it there.

But how? If I'm carrying it through the path: room_2 -> room_1 -> room_3 -> room_4. Then drop it in room_4. But also, constraint 12 requires holding green_box_1, which is in room_4. So perhaps after getting to room_4, pick up green_box_1 and drop it again?

But let's outline the steps:

1. In room_2, initial state. Need to unlock blue_door_1.

   - gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1 (precondition: in room_2, door connects room_2 and room_1, no block in front of door. Assuming possible.)

   - toggle blue_door_1 (unlock it)

   - gotoroom room_2 room_1 blue_door_1 (now in room_1)

   Now, constraint 3: when we get to room_4, must have been in room_1 before. So that's covered.

2. In room_1, need to unlock blue_door_2 to go to room_3.

   - gotodoor blue_door_2 room_1 room_3

   - toggle blue_door_2 (unlock)

   - gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_2 (now in room_3)

   Now in room_3, need to unlock green_door_1 to room_4.

3. In room_3:

   - gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4

   - toggle green_door_1 (unlock)

   - gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_1 (now in room_4)

   Now, in room_4. The goal is to be in room_4 and in front of purple_ball_1.

   So:

   - gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4 (if possible)

   Then, the goal is achieved.

   But also, check constraints:

   - Must be in front of green_door_1. Which we did when in room_3, gotodoor green_door_1.

   - Must be in room_4 (done).

   - Constraint 3: when in room_4, must have been in room_1 before (yes, step 1).

   - Constraint 5: must be in front of blue_door_3. Blue_door_3 is in room_2 and room_4. But we can't go to room_4 via blue_door_3 because it's locked. But maybe when in room_4, go to blue_door_3 (room_4 side) and be in front of it. But blue_door_3 is locked, but the constraint says it must remain locked. So that's allowed. So:

   While in room_4:

   - gotodoor blue_door_3 room_4 room_2. But blue_door_3 is locked, but the action gotodoor just requires being in the room and door not blocked. So yes.

   Then, being in front of blue_door_3 in room_4.

   But also, constraint 6: if in front of blue_door_3, then earlier state where blue_door_2 is unlocked or holding purple_box_1.

   In our path, blue_door_2 was unlocked (step 2), so that's satisfied.

   So after entering room_4, we can go to blue_door_3 (room_4 side) to satisfy constraint 5.

   Also, constraint 8: grey_box_3 must be in room_4. Currently, grey_box_3 is in room_2. So we need to move it. So perhaps in room_2, pick up grey_box_3, carry it through rooms to room_4, then drop it.

   So let's adjust the plan:

   Start in room_2. Pick up grey_box_3.

   But to pick up, need to be in front of it. So:

   - gotoobject grey_box_3 room_2

   - pick grey_box_3 room_2

   Then proceed to unlock blue_door_1, go to room_1, then room_3, then room_4. Then drop grey_box_3 in room_4.

   But when moving through doors, you can carry objects.

   But also, constraint 10: if in room_2 (any state), must be holding an object then or after. So since we start in room_2, pick up grey_box_3, which satisfies holding an object. So that's okay.

   Also, constraint 12: must hold green_box_1. Green_box_1 is in room_4, so after arriving in room_4, need to pick it up.

   So steps after arriving in room_4:

   - gotoobject green_box_1 room_4

   - pick green_box_1 room_4

   Then drop it somewhere? Or just hold it temporarily.

   Also, constraint 11: at least once, hold some object or purple_box_1. We are holding grey_box_3 and green_box_1, which satisfies that.

   Let's outline the plan:

   1. In room_2:

      a. gotoobject grey_box_3 room_2

      b. pick grey_box_3 room_2

      Now holding grey_box_3.

   2. gotoempty (to leave front of the box?)

      Wait, after picking, you are no longer in front of it. So maybe after picking, you can proceed to the door.

   3. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1

   4. toggle blue_door_1 (unlock)

   5. gotoroom room_2 room_1 blue_door_1 (now in room_1)

   6. gotodoor blue_door_2 room_1 room_3

   7. toggle blue_door_2 (unlock)

   8. gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_2 (now in room_3)

   9. gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4

   10. toggle green_door_1 (unlock)

   11. gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_1 (now in room_4)

   12. drop grey_box_3 room_4 (now grey_box_3 is in room_4, satisfying constraint 8)

   13. gotoobject green_box_1 room_4

   14. pick green_box_1 room_4 (satisfies constraint 12)

   15. drop green_box_1 room_4 (if needed)

   16. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4

   Now, check constraints:

   - Constraint 1: in front of green_door_1. Step 9 and 10.

   - Constraint 2: in room_4. Steps 11 onward.

   - Constraint 3: when in room_4 (step 11), earlier state was in room_1 (step 5) and holding grey_box_3 (from step 1 onward).

   - Constraint 4: blue_door_3 is always locked. We never touched it.

   - Constraint 5: in front of blue_door_3. Need to do that. So after step 11, in room_4, go to blue_door_3:

   17. gotodoor blue_door_3 room_4 room_2 (now in front of blue_door_3 in room_4)

   Then proceed to step 16.

   Also, constraint 6: when in front of blue_door_3 (step 17), earlier state must have blue_door_2 unlocked (step 7) or holding purple_box_1. We have blue_door_2 unlocked, so okay.

   Constraint 7: must be in room_3. Step 8-10.

   Constraint 8: grey_box_3 in room_4 after step 12.

   Constraint 9: be in room_2. Initial state, but after step 5, we left. But in step 3, we were in room_2. Also, in the initial state, you have visited room_2, but need to be in room_2 again. Wait, constraint 9 says must be in room_2 at least once. The initial state counts. But if during the plan, we leave room_2 and never return, that's okay. So the initial state satisfies constraint 9.

   Constraint 10: if in room_2 at any state, must hold object then or after. The initial state is in room_2 and not holding, but after step 1, we pick up grey_box_3 in room_2, so in the initial state, we are in room_2 and not holding, but in step 1 (same room?), wait, the initial state is room_2, and step 1 is gotoobject in room_2, then pick. So during the initial state (step 0), you are in room_2 and not holding. But constraint 10 says that if in room_2 in any state, then you must be holding at that state or after. So after the initial state, step 1: you are in room_2 and pick up the object, satisfying that. So the initial state is in room_2, but after that, you pick up an object, so the constraint is satisfied.

   Constraint 11: at least once, holding some object or purple_box_1. We hold grey_box_3 and green_box_1.

   Constraint 12: hold green_box_1. Step 14.

   Constraint 13: hold some object. Steps 1,14.

   So the plan seems to satisfy all constraints.

   Now, the sequence of actions would be:

   1. gotoobject grey_box_3 room_2

   2. pick grey_box_3 room_2

   3. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1

   4. toggle blue_door_1

   5. gotoroom room_2 room_1 blue_door_1

   6. gotodoor blue_door_2 room_1 room_3

   7. toggle blue_door_2

   8. gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_2

   9. gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4

   10. toggle green_door_1

   11. gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_1

   12. drop grey_box_3 room_4

   13. gotoobject green_box_1 room_4

   14. pick green_box_1 room_4

   15. drop green_box_1 room_4

   16. gotodoor blue_door_3 room_4 room_2

   17. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4

   Wait, but after step 17, we are in front of purple_ball_1 in room_4, which is the goal.

   Also, step 16 is gotodoor blue_door_3 room_4 room_2 to satisfy constraint 5 (being in front of blue_door_3). Then step 17 is gotoobject purple_ball_1.

   Now, check the order. After dropping grey_box_3 and green_box_1, we need to go to the purple_ball_1. But in step 12, we drop grey_box_3, then in step 13, go to green_box_1, pick it up, drop it in 15. Then go to blue_door_3 (step 16), then to the ball.

   That should work. Also, after step 11, we are in room_4, which requires that earlier we were in room_1 or holding grey_box_3. We were holding grey_box_3 since step 2, so that's satisfied.

   Also, step 16 is in front of blue_door_3, which requires that in an earlier state, blue_door_2 was unlocked (step7) or holding purple_box_1. Blue_door_2 was unlocked, so okay.

   All constraints seem met. Let's check again:

   - Be in front of green_door_1: step9.

   - Be in room_4: step11.

   - When in room_4, earlier in room_1 (step5) and holding grey_box_3 (steps2-12).

   - blue_door_3 remains locked always (no toggle).

   - Be in front of blue_door_3: step16.

   - When in front of blue_door_3, earlier blue_door_2 was unlocked (step7).

   - Be in room_3: step8-10.

   - grey_box_3 in room_4: step12.

   - Be in room_2: initial state and step3.

   - When in room_2 (initial state), later hold object (step2).

   - At least once holding some object or purple_box_1: yes.

   - Hold green_box_1: step14.

   - Hold some object: yes.

   So the plan is valid. Now, check if it's optimal (shortest possible). Maybe there's a shorter path, but given the constraints, this seems necessary. For example, moving grey_box_3 to room_4 requires going through the doors. Also, unlocking doors requires multiple steps. So this seems optimal.
