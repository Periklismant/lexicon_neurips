This is a planning problem in a 2D gridworld. Let me summarize the problem:

1. There are 4 rooms arranged in a square formation: room_1 (NW), room_2 (SW), room_3 (NE), and room_4 (SE).
2. The rooms are connected via doors: blue_door_1 (room_1-room_2), blue_door_2 (room_1-room_3), blue_door_3 (room_2-room_4), and green_door_1 (room_3-room_4).
3. All doors are initially locked.
4. I am in room_2, and there are various boxes and balls distributed across the rooms.

My goal is to be in room_4, in front of a purple ball.

Let's analyze the available actions and their preconditions and effects to plan a solution.

From the initial state:
- I am in room_2.
- purple_ball_1 is in room_4 (this is the only purple ball mentioned).
- To reach room_4 from room_2, I need to use blue_door_3.
- blue_door_3 is locked, so I need to go to it and toggle it to unlock it.

So the general plan should be:
1. Go to blue_door_3 in room_2.
2. Toggle blue_door_3 to unlock it.
3. Go to room_4 from room_2 using blue_door_3.
4. Inside room_4, go to purple_ball_1.

Let's execute this plan step by step:

1. First, I need to go to blue_door_3 in room_2:
   - Action: "gotodoor blue_door_3 room_2 room_4"

2. Toggle blue_door_3 to unlock it:
   - Action: "toggle blue_door_3"

3. Go to room_4 from room_2 using blue_door_3:
   - Action: "gotoroom room_2 room_4 blue_door_3"

4. Inside room_4, go to purple_ball_1:
   - Action: "gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4"

This plan should satisfy the goal of being in room_4 and in front of purple_ball_1, which is a purple ball.

Let's double-check the actions and their preconditions:

1. "gotodoor blue_door_3 room_2 room_4": I am in room_2, and blue_door_3 connects room_2 and room_4. No objects are mentioned as blocking the door, so this should be valid.

2. "toggle blue_door_3": I am in front of blue_door_3 after the previous action, so this should be valid.

3. "gotoroom room_2 room_4 blue_door_3": I am in room_2, and blue_door_3 connects room_2 and room_4 and is now unlocked, so this should be valid.

4. "gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4": I am in room_4, and purple_ball_1 is in room_4, so this should be valid.

Let's check the final state after executing this plan:
- I am in room_4.
- I am in front of purple_ball_1.
- purple_ball_1 is purple and is in room_4.

This matches the goal state, so the plan should be valid and optimal. The optimal plan consists of 4 actions.

Let me confirm that this is the shortest plan possible:
- I need to unlock blue_door_3 to go from room_2 to room_4, which requires 2 actions.
- I then need to go to room_4, which requires 1 action.
- Finally, I need to go to purple_ball_1 in room_4, which requires 1 action.

In total, this is 4 actions, which is minimal. There might be alternative optimal plans, but they would have the same length.

Actually, I just realized another path: I could go from room_2 to room_1 (via blue_door_1), then to room_3 (via blue_door_2), and finally to room_4 (via green_door_1). This would require unlocking 3 doors instead of 1, so it would be longer.

So the optimal plan is:
1. "gotodoor blue_door_3 room_2 room_4"
2. "toggle blue_door_3"
3. "gotoroom room_2 room_4 blue_door_3"
4. "gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4"
