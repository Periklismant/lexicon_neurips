Okay, let's try to figure out this planning problem. The goal is to get a purple box into room_1, be in room_1 in front of that box. The constraints are a bit complex, so I need to make sure all of them are satisfied. Let me start by listing out the initial state and the goal.

Initial State:
- I'm in room_2.
- Purple_box_1 is in room_1.
- All doors are locked: red_door_1, grey_door_1, yellow_door_1, purple_door_1.
- The goal requires a purple box (v) in room_1, me in room_1, in front of v. Since purple_box_1 is already in room_1, maybe the main challenge is getting there and being in front of it. But wait, the goal is to have "there exists a box v" meeting those conditions. So maybe the existing purple_box_1 is sufficient. So the main task is to get me to room_1, in front of purple_box_1.

Constraints:
1. At some point, I must be holding an object.
2. At some point, yellow_door_1 must be unlocked.
3. red_door_1 must always be locked. So never unlock it.
4. At some point, I must be in room_2. Well, initial state is room_2, so that's covered.
5. If I'm in room_2 in any state, then either in that state or a subsequent one, I must be holding red_ball_1 and yellow_ball_2 must be in room_2. But yellow_ball_2 is initially in room_3. So I need to move it to room_2. But how? Since yellow_door_1 connects room_2 and room_4, and room_4 is connected to room_3 via purple_door_1. Hmm. Maybe through room_4?
6. At some point, purple_door_1 must be unlocked.
7. At some point, blue_box_1 must be in room_1. It's initially in room_3. So need to move it there. But how? Doors between room_3 and room_1 are grey_door_1, which is locked. So need to unlock that first.
8. At some point, I must be in front of purple_box_1. That's part of the goal, so that's covered once I achieve the goal.
9. If I'm in front of purple_box_1 (which is the goal state), then in an earlier state, I must have been holding green_ball_1 or some object. So when I go to front of purple_box_1, I need to have held something before. So maybe pick up an object, then drop it later.
10. At some point, I must be in room_1. The goal requires that, so that's covered.
11. If I'm in room_1, then grey_door_1 must have been unlocked in a previous state. So to get to room_1 from room_3, which is connected via grey_door_1. But initially, I'm in room_2. The doors from room_2 to room_1 is red_door_1, which is locked and must remain locked. So how do I get to room_1? Wait, the initial connections: room_2 is connected to room_1 via red_door_1 (locked), and to room_4 via yellow_door_1 (locked). So from room_2, the only door is red_door_1 (locked, can't be toggled because red_door_1 must stay locked). Wait, the constraint says that red_door_1 must be locked in every state. So I can't unlock it. So the initial path to room_1 is blocked. How can I get to room_1 then?

Wait, the connections: room_1 is connected to room_3 via grey_door_1. So if I can get to room_3, then perhaps unlock grey_door_1 to go to room_1. But how to get to room_3? From room_4 via purple_door_1. Room_4 is connected to room_2 via yellow_door_1 and to room_3 via purple_door_1. So maybe the path is room_2 → room_4 (if we unlock yellow_door_1) → room_3 via purple_door_1 (unlock it?), then room_1 via grey_door_1 (unlock it). Then from room_1, I can access the purple_box_1.

But let's step through the possible steps.

Starting in room_2. All doors are locked. To move to another room, I need to unlock a door. But red_door_1 can't be unlocked (must remain locked). So the only other door from room_2 is yellow_door_1 to room_4. So I need to unlock yellow_door_1. But to toggle a door, I need to be in front of it. So first, go to the door, then toggle.

So steps:

1. From room_2, go to yellow_door_1. But to goto door, I need to be in a room connected via that door. So yellow_door_1 connects room_2 and room_4. So in room_2, I can goto yellow_door_1. But the precondition for gotodoor is that there's no object blocking the position in front of the door. Are there any objects blocking doors in room_2? The initial state doesn't mention any objects in room_2 except possibly the boxes and balls. Wait, initial objects: blue_ball_1, purple_box_1, red_ball_1 in room_1; yellow_ball_1, blue_box_1, yellow_ball_2, grey_box_1 in room_3; green_ball_1 in room_4. So in room_2, there are no objects. So the doors in room_2 (red_door_1 and yellow_door_1) are not blocked. So I can go to yellow_door_1.

So:

Action: gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_4

Then toggle it to unlock. Since it's initially locked, toggling once will unlock it.

Action: toggle yellow_door_1

Now, yellow_door_1 is unlocked. Now, I can go to room_4 from room_2 via yellow_door_1.

Action: gotoroom room_2 room_4 yellow_door_1

Now I'm in room_4. Now, from room_4, I can go to room_3 via purple_door_1 (which is locked). Need to unlock that. So first, goto purple_door_1 in room_4.

Action: gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_3

Then toggle it to unlock.

Action: toggle purple_door_1

Now, purple_door_1 is unlocked. Now go to room_3.

Action: gotoroom room_4 room_3 purple_door_1

Now in room_3. Now, need to unlock grey_door_1 (connecting room_3 to room_1). But grey_door_1 is initially locked. So goto grey_door_1 in room_3.

Action: gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1

Toggle it to unlock.

Action: toggle grey_door_1

Now, grey_door_1 is unlocked. Now, go to room_1 from room_3.

Action: gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1

Now in room_1. Now, need to be in front of purple_box_1. So gotoobject purple_box_1 room_1.

But wait, the preconditions for gotoobject: you must be in the same room as x. Since I'm in room_1, that's okay.

Action: gotoobject purple_box_1 room_1

But according to the constraints, when I'm in front of purple_box_1, there must have been a prior state where I was holding an object. So I need to have picked up and possibly dropped an object before this.

So perhaps during the journey, I need to pick up an object. Let's see. Let's check the constraints:

Constraints:
- Must hold an object at some point. So I need to pick up something.
- The constraint related to being in room_2: when in room_2 (which is the initial state), then either at that state or later, I must be holding red_ball_1 and yellow_ball_2 must be in room_2. But in the initial state, red_ball_1 is in room_1. So unless I bring it to room_2. Wait, but I can't get back to room_2 once I leave, because to return, I need to go through red_door_1 (which is locked and must stay locked). So initial state is room_2. If I leave, can I come back? Let's think.

Wait, after moving to room_4, to get back to room_2, yellow_door_1 is now unlocked. So yes, if I go back to room_4, I can return to room_2. So perhaps after moving to room_4, room_3, etc., I can come back to room_2 to fulfill the constraint. But the constraint says that whenever I'm in room_2 (in any state), then in that state or a subsequent one, I must be holding red_ball_1 and yellow_ball_2 must be in room_2. But the initial state is room_2, so that's a problem. Because in the initial state, I'm not holding red_ball_1 and yellow_ball_2 is not in room_2. So the initial state violates the constraint? Wait, no. The constraint says: if in a state s, I'm in room_2, then in s or some state after s, I must hold red_ball_1 and yellow_ball_2 is in room_2. So the initial state is s0 where I'm in room_2. So s0 must satisfy that in s0 or some state after s0, I hold red_ball_1 and yellow_ball_2 is in room_2. So I need to achieve that at some point after s0. So I need to eventually have red_ball_1 in my possession and yellow_ball_2 in room_2.

But red_ball_1 is in room_1. To get it, I need to go to room_1. Which I can do via room_3. But how to get red_ball_1 to room_2? Since red_door_1 is locked. So unless I bring it through another path. Wait, room_1 is connected to room_3 via grey_door_1. So from room_1 to room_3, then to room_4 via purple_door_1, then to room_2 via yellow_door_1. But that's a long way. So I can pick up red_ball_1 in room_1, carry it to room_3, then room_4, then room_2. Then drop it in room_2. But also, yellow_ball_2 is in room_3. So I need to bring yellow_ball_2 to room_2. So maybe pick up yellow_ball_2 in room_3, carry it to room_4, then to room_2.

So this seems like a lot. Let's outline the steps:

1. From room_2, unlock yellow_door_1 and go to room_4.
2. Unlock purple_door_1 and go to room_3.
3. Unlock grey_door_1 and go to room_1.
4. Pick up red_ball_1 in room_1.
5. Bring it back to room_3, then to room_4, then to room_2.
6. Also, pick up yellow_ball_2 in room_3 and bring it to room_2.

But this adds a lot of steps. Also, the constraint that blue_box_1 must be in room_1. It's initially in room_3. So need to move it to room_1. Which requires moving through room_3 to room_1 via grey_door_1 (which is now unlocked). So perhaps after unlocking grey_door_1, go to room_3, pick up blue_box_1, bring it to room_1, then proceed.

Wait, but the goal is to have the purple box in room_1, which is already there. But the constraint requires that blue_box_1 must be in room_1 at some point. So blue_box_1 is in room_3. So need to move it to room_1. So steps:

After unlocking grey_door_1 (from room_3 to room_1), go to room_3, pick up blue_box_1, bring to room_1, drop it. Then later, perhaps move it again? Or just once.

Also, the constraint that when in front of purple_box_1, must have held an object before. So when I eventually get to front of purple_box_1, I need to have held something. Maybe during the process of moving blue_box_1, I pick it up and drop it, which would satisfy that.

So let's try to map out the steps in order.

Initial plan outline:

1. Start in room_2.
2. Go to yellow_door_1 (room_2, room_4).
3. Toggle yellow_door_1 (unlock).
4. Go to room_4.
5. Go to purple_door_1 (room_4, room_3).
6. Toggle purple_door_1 (unlock).
7. Go to room_3.
8. Go to grey_door_1 (room_3, room_1).
9. Toggle grey_door_1 (unlock).
10. Go to room_1. (Now in room_1)
11. Now, need to get blue_box_1 to room_1. Blue_box_1 is in room_3. So need to go back to room_3, pick it up, bring to room_1.
    a. From room_1, go to grey_door_1 (room_1, room_3) [grey_door_1 is unlocked]
    b. Go to room_3.
    c. Go to blue_box_1 in room_3.
    d. Pick blue_box_1.
    e. Go back to room_1 via grey_door_1.
    f. Drop blue_box_1 in room_1. (Now constraint 7 is satisfied)
12. Then, pick up red_ball_1 in room_1.
13. Bring it back to room_3, then room_4, room_2, drop in room_2.
14. Also, pick up yellow_ball_2 in room_3 and bring to room_2.
15. Finally, go back to room_1 and be in front of purple_box_1.

But this seems very long. Let's see if there's a more optimal path.

Alternatively, after step 10 (being in room_1), perhaps:

11. Gotoobject purple_box_1 room_1. But then the constraint requires that I had held something before. So maybe first pick up red_ball_1 in room_1, then drop it, then go to purple_box_1.

But that would satisfy the holding constraint. Also, need to bring blue_box_1 to room_1. So:

After step 10:

11. Gotoobject red_ball_1 room_1.
12. Pick red_ball_1. (Now holding it, satisfies constraint 1)
13. Drop red_ball_1 room_1. (But why? Maybe to free hands)
14. Now, go to grey_door_1, go back to room_3.
15. Gotoobject blue_box_1 room_3.
16. Pick blue_box_1.
17. Gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1.
18. Drop blue_box_1 room_1. (Now constraint 7 is met)
19. Now, need to get red_ball_1 and yellow_ball_2 to room_2.

But red_ball_1 is in room_1. To bring it to room_2, need a path. But red_door_1 is locked, so can't go directly. Must go through room_1 → room_3 → room_4 → room_2.

So:

20. Pick red_ball_1 again in room_1.
21. Go to room_3, then room_4, then room_2.
22. Drop red_ball_1 in room_2. (But then, when in room_2, must have red_ball_1 in hand or yellow_ball_2 in room_2. So if I drop it, then when in room_2 again, yellow_ball_2 must be there.)

But yellow_ball_2 is in room_3. So need to bring it to room_2. So:

23. After dropping red_ball_1 in room_2, go back to room_4, then room_3.
24. Pick yellow_ball_2 in room_3.
25. Bring to room_4, then room_2, drop it.

But this is getting complicated and possibly not optimal. Let's see if there's a smarter way.

Alternatively, after dropping blue_box_1 in room_1 (step 18), perhaps proceed to pick red_ball_1, carry it to room_3, then to room_4, then to room_2. Then drop it. Then pick up yellow_ball_2 in room_3, bring to room_4, then room_2. But this adds many steps. However, the constraint for room_2 is that whenever you are in room_2 (including when you return), you must have red_ball_1 and yellow_ball_2 in room_2 at some point after.

Wait, the constraint is: If in some state s, you are in room_2, then in s or after, you must hold red_ball_1 and yellow_ball_2 must be in room_2. So if after returning to room_2, you have red_ball_1 in your hand or dropped in room_2, and yellow_ball_2 in room_2, then it's satisfied.

So perhaps when you return to room_2 with red_ball_1, drop it there. Then go back again to get yellow_ball_2. Alternatively, if you can carry both, but you can only hold one object at a time.

Wait, the action "pick" requires that you are not holding any other object. So you can only carry one at a time.

This suggests that the plan will have to include multiple trips.

But this is getting very long. Let's think about the minimal steps required.

The main goal is to be in room_1 in front of purple_box_1. Along the way, meet all constraints.

Constraints to satisfy:

- Must hold an object (done by picking red_ball_1 or others)
- Yellow_door_1 must be unlocked (done when we toggle it)
- purple_door_1 must be unlocked (done when toggled)
- blue_box_1 in room_1 (move it there)
- in front of purple_box_1 (done in goal)
- when in front of purple_box_1, must have held something before (done by picking red_ball_1)
- when in room_1, must have unlocked grey_door_1 before (done by unlocking it before entering room_1)
- etc.

So here's a possible plan:

1. From room_2: goto yellow_door_1 (room_2 to room4)
   Action: gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_4
2. Toggle yellow_door_1 (unlock)
   Action: toggle yellow_door_1
3. Gotoroom room_2 room_4 yellow_door_1 (now in room4)
4. goto purple_door_1 in room4
   Action: gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_3
5. toggle purple_door_1 (unlock)
   Action: toggle purple_door_1
6. gotoroom room4 to room3 via purple_door_1
7. goto grey_door_1 in room3
   Action: gotodoor grey_door_1 room3 room1
8. toggle grey_door_1 (unlock)
   Action: toggle grey_door_1
9. gotoroom room3 to room1 via grey_door_1 (now in room1)
10. Now, need to move blue_box_1 to room1. It's in room3. So go back to room3:
    Action: gotodoor grey_door_1 room1 room3
    Action: gotoroom room1 room3 grey_door_1 (back to room3)
11. goto blue_box_1 in room3
    Action: gotoobject blue_box_1 room3
12. pick blue_box_1
    Action: pick blue_box_1 room3
13. go back to room1:
    Action: gotodoor grey_door_1 room3 room1
    Action: gotoroom room3 room1 grey_door_1
14. drop blue_box_1 in room1
    Action: drop blue_box_1 room1 (now constraint 7 met)
15. Now, to satisfy the room_2 constraint: need to have red_ball_1 in hand and yellow_ball_2 in room2.

But red_ball_1 is in room1. So pick it up:

16. gotoobject red_ball_1 room1
17. pick red_ball_1 (now holding it, satisfies constraint 1)
18. Now need to take it to room2. Path: room1 → room3 → room4 → room2.

19. gotodoor grey_door_1 room1 room3
20. gotoroom room1 room3 grey_door_1 (now in room3)
21. gotodoor purple_door_1 room3 room4
22. gotoroom room3 room4 purple_door_1 (now in room4)
23. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room4 room2
24. gotoroom room4 room2 yellow_door_1 (now in room2)
25. drop red_ball_1 room2 (now in room2, so the constraint says that in this state (room2) or after, must hold red_ball_1 and yellow_ball_2 in room2. Since I just dropped it, the state after has red_ball_1 in room2. But yellow_ball_2 is still in room3. So need to bring yellow_ball_2 to room2.

So:

26. Now, need to get yellow_ball_2 from room3 to room2. So go back:

    Action: gotodoor yellow_door_1 room2 room4
    Action: gotoroom room2 room4 yellow_door_1 (to room4)
    Action: gotodoor purple_door_1 room4 room3
    Action: gotoroom room4 room3 purple_door_1 (to room3)
27. gotoobject yellow_ball_2 room3
28. pick yellow_ball_2
29. return to room2:
    Action: gotodoor purple_door_1 room3 room4
    Action: gotoroom room3 room4 purple_door_1
    Action: gotodoor yellow_door_1 room4 room2
    Action: gotoroom room4 room2 yellow_door_1
30. drop yellow_ball_2 room2

Now, in room2, red_ball_1 is there and yellow_ball_2 is there. So whenever I'm in room2 (like now), the constraint is satisfied.

Now, need to go back to room1 to be in front of purple_box_1.

Path: room2 → room4 → room3 → room1.

31. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room2 room4
32. gotoroom room2 room4 yellow_door_1 (room4)
33. gotodoor purple_door_1 room4 room3
34. gotoroom room4 room3 purple_door_1 (room3)
35. gotodoor grey_door_1 room3 room1
36. gotoroom room3 room1 grey_door_1 (room1)
37. gotoobject purple_box_1 room1 (this is the goal)

But when I do this, the constraint that being in front of purple_box_1 requires having held an object earlier is satisfied because I held red_ball_1 and yellow_ball_2.

Now, check all constraints:

- Hold an object: yes, when picked red_ball_1.
- yellow_door_1 unlocked: yes, step 2.
- red_door_1 always locked: yes, never touched.
- been in room_2: yes, multiple times.
- When in room_2, held red_ball_1 and yellow_ball_2 in room2: yes, after steps 25 and 30.
- purple_door_1 unlocked: yes, step5.
- blue_box_1 in room1: yes, step14.
- in front of purple_box_1: step37.
- constraint for front of purple_box_1: had held objects (steps 17 and 28).
- been in room1: yes.
- when in room1, grey_door_1 was unlocked earlier: yes, step8.

So this plan seems to satisfy all constraints. But it's very long. Is there a shorter path?

Let's think: maybe after moving blue_box_1 to room1, instead of going all the way back to room2 with red_ball_1 and yellow_ball_2, perhaps combine steps.

But the problem is that the constraint requires that whenever you are in room2, you must eventually have red_ball_1 and yellow_ball_2 there. Since you start in room2, you have to ensure that after the initial state, you eventually bring those items to room2. So even if you leave room2 and come back, you need to satisfy that.

But maybe there's a smarter way. Let's see:

After step 14 (blue_box_1 in room1), can we go to room3, pick yellow_ball_2, bring it to room4, then room2. Then drop it. Then pick red_ball_1 in room1, bring to room3, room4, room2, drop. Then finally go back to room1. But this would require:

Steps after step14:

15. go back to room3 (from room1)
16. pick yellow_ball_2 in room3
17. go to room4, then room2
18. drop yellow_ball_2 in room2 (now satisfies part of room2 constraint)
19. then go back to room1 via room4 and room3
20. pick red_ball_1 in room1
21. go back to room2 via room3, room4, and drop red_ball_1
22. then go back to room1 again.

This adds even more steps. Alternatively, maybe after step14, when in room1, pick red_ball_1 and yellow_ball_2 in the same trip. But you can't carry both. So no.

Alternatively, after step14 (blue_box_1 in room1), you're in room1. Maybe:

15. pick red_ball_1 in room1
16. go to room3, room4, room2, drop red_ball_1 in room2
17. then go back to room3, pick yellow_ball_2, bring to room2
18. then go back to room1.

This would be:

After step14:

15. gotoobject red_ball_1 room1
16. pick red_ball_1
17. gotodoor grey_door_1 room1 room3
18. gotoroom room1 room3 grey_door_1
19. gotodoor purple_door_1 room3 room4
20. gotoroom room3 room4 purple_door_1
21. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room4 room2
22. gotoroom room4 room2 yellow_door_1
23. drop red_ball_1 room2
24. Now, in room2. Need to pick yellow_ball_2 from room3 and bring to room2.
25. goto yellow_door_1 room2 room4
26. gotoroom room2 room4 yellow_door_1
27. goto purple_door_1 room4 room3
28. gotoroom room4 room3 purple_door_1
29. gotoobject yellow_ball_2 room3
30. pick yellow_ball_2
31. gotodoor purple_door_1 room3 room4
32. gotoroom room3 room4 purple_door_1
33. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room4 room2
34. gotoroom room4 room2 yellow_door_1
35. drop yellow_ball_2 room2
36. Now, need to go back to room1.
37. goto yellow_door_1 room2 room4
38. gotoroom room2 room4 yellow_door_1
39. goto purple_door_1 room4 room3
40. gotoroom room4 room3 purple_door_1
41. goto grey_door_1 room3 room1
42. gotoroom room3 room1 grey_door_1
43. gotoobject purple_box_1 room1

But this is still very long. Is there a shorter path?

Wait, maybe after dropping blue_box_1 in room1 (step14), we can proceed to pick red_ball_1 and bring it to room2, then pick yellow_ball_2 and bring it to room2, then go to room1. But each trip takes multiple steps.

Alternatively, maybe after step14, instead of immediately handling the room2 constraints, proceed to the goal first, but that might not satisfy the constraints.

Alternatively, perhaps the room2 constraint can be satisfied when we return to room2 after dropping red_ball_1 and yellow_ball_2. But the plan must include all necessary steps.

Given the complexity, perhaps the minimal plan involves all these steps. However, considering that the problem requires an optimal plan (shortest possible), there might be a smarter way.

Wait, the goal is to be in room1 in front of purple_box_1. The purple_box_1 is already in room1. So the main steps are getting to room1. The other constraints are to be satisfied along the way.

Another approach:

Unlock yellow_door_1 and purple_door_1, then go to room3, unlock grey_door_1, go to room1. Then do the necessary steps.

But when you're in room1, you need to have blue_box_1 there. So you need to go back to room3, get it, bring to room1. Also, handle the room2 constraints.

But perhaps the room2 constraints can be satisfied during the initial trip to room2. Wait, initial state is room2. So the constraint requires that in s0 (initial state) or after, you must hold red_ball_1 and yellow_ball_2 must be in room2. So if you can get red_ball_1 and yellow_ball_2 to room2 before leaving room2 for the first time, but that's impossible because you can't go to room1 (red_door_1 is locked). So you have to leave room2 first, unlock doors, get the items, then return to room2.

But the initial plan outline requires multiple trips. It's possible that this is the only way.

Alternatively, think about the fact that the room2 constraint is only triggered when you are in room2. So once you leave room2 and never return, the constraint is only applied to the initial state. But in the initial state, you are in room2, so you must satisfy that you hold red_ball_1 and yellow_ball_2 is in room2 at some point after. So even if you leave room2 and never return, you have to have those conditions met in the future. So you can't avoid bringing red_ball_1 and yellow_ball_2 to room2.

So the steps are necessary.

But this seems to require a lot of steps. However, given that the problem asks for an optimal plan, maybe there's a shorter way.

Wait, perhaps after unlocking the necessary doors, you can bring both red_ball_1 and yellow_ball_2 to room2 in a single trip.

For example:

After step14 (blue_box_1 in room1):

15. goto red_ball_1 in room1, pick it, go to room3, then room4, then room2, drop it.

16. Then, return to room3, pick yellow_ball_2, go to room4, then room2, drop it.

But this requires two separate trips. So steps 15-16 add 8 steps each trip.

Alternatively, perhaps after moving blue_box_1 to room1, you can pick red_ball_1, carry it to room2, then go back to room3, pick yellow_ball_2, and carry it to room2. Then proceed to room1.

But each trip takes several steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the order in which you handle objects can be optimized. For example, when you are in room3 after unlocking grey_door_1, pick blue_box_1 and take it to room1, then pick red_ball_1 and carry it to room2 via room3, room4.

But no, red_ball_1 is in room1, so after moving blue_box_1, you need to go back to room1 to get red_ball_1.

This seems unavoidable.

Alternatively, after step9 (arrive in room1 for the first time), instead of immediately going back to room3 to get blue_box_1, perhaps first pick red_ball_1, carry it to room3, room4, room2, drop it. Then return to room3, get blue_box_1, bring to room1. Then proceed to get yellow_ball_2.

But this way, you can satisfy the room2 constraint earlier.

Let me try:

1. Initial steps 1-9: arrive in room1.

10. goto red_ball_1 room1, pick it.

11. go to room3 via grey_door_1.

12. go to room4 via purple_door_1.

13. go to room2 via yellow_door_1.

14. drop red_ball_1 in room2. Now, when you are in room2, the constraint is satisfied for red_ball_1. But yellow_ball_2 is still in room3. So need to bring it.

15. go back to room4, then room3.

16. pick yellow_ball_2.

17. go to room4, then room2.

18. drop yellow_ball_2. Now, both are in room2. Then go back to room1.

But then need to get blue_box_1 to room1.

19. go to room3 via room4.

20. pick blue_box_1.

21. go to room1 via grey_door_1.

22. drop blue_box_1.

23. then goto purple_box_1.

This approach might save some steps. Let's count the actions:

1. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room2 room4
2. toggle yellow_door_1
3. gotoroom room2 room4 yellow_door_1
4. gotodoor purple_door_1 room4 room3
5. toggle purple_door_1
6. gotoroom room4 room3 purple_door_1
7. gotodoor grey_door_1 room3 room1
8. toggle grey_door_1
9. gotoroom room3 room1 grey_door_1
10. gotoobject red_ball_1 room1
11. pick red_ball_1 room1
12. gotodoor grey_door_1 room1 room3
13. gotoroom room1 room3 grey_door_1
14. gotodoor purple_door_1 room3 room4
15. gotoroom room3 room4 purple_door_1
16. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room4 room2
17. gotoroom room4 room2 yellow_door_1
18. drop red_ball_1 room2
19. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room2 room4
20. gotoroom room2 room4 yellow_door_1
21. gotodoor purple_door_1 room4 room3
22. gotoroom room4 room3 purple_door_1
23. gotoobject yellow_ball_2 room3
24. pick yellow_ball_2 room3
25. gotodoor purple_door_1 room3 room4
26. gotoroom room3 room4 purple_door_1
27. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room4 room2
28. gotoroom room4 room2 yellow_door_1
29. drop yellow_ball_2 room2
30. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room2 room4
31. gotoroom room2 room4 yellow_door_1
32. gotodoor purple_door_1 room4 room3
33. gotoroom room4 room3 purple_door_1
34. gotoobject blue_box_1 room3
35. pick blue_box_1 room3
36. gotodoor grey_door_1 room3 room1
37. gotoroom room3 room1 grey_door_1
38. drop blue_box_1 room1
39. gotoobject purple_box_1 room1

This is 39 actions. The previous approach had around 43 steps. So this is better but still long.

But maybe there's a way to optimize further. For example, after dropping red_ball_1 in room2 (step18), instead of going back to room3, perhaps go to room4 and room3 via the same path.

But I think this is as optimized as it gets. The problem is that all the constraints require multiple trips.

Alternatively, after step18 (drop red_ball_1 in room2), I need to get yellow_ball_2. But how? I'm in room2. To get to room3, I have to go through room4. So steps:

19. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room2 room4
20. gotoroom room2 room4 yellow_door_1
21. gotodoor purple_door_1 room4 room3
22. gotoroom room4 room3 purple_door_1
23. gotoobject yellow_ball_2 room3
24. pick yellow_ball_2
25. gotodoor purple_door_1 room3 room4
26. gotoroom room3 room4 purple_door_1
27. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room4 room2
28. gotoroom room4 room2 yellow_door_1
29. drop yellow_ball_2 room2
30. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room2 room4
31. gotoroom room2 room4 yellow_door_1
32. gotodoor purple_door_1 room4 room3
33. gotoroom room4 room3 purple_door_1
34. gotoobject blue_box_1 room3
35. pick blue_box_1 room3
36. gotodoor grey_door_1 room3 room1
37. gotoroom room3 room1 grey_door_1
38. drop blue_box_1 room1
39. gotoobject purple_box_1 room1

Still 39 steps. Not sure if there's a way to reduce this.

Alternatively, after step18, when in room2, instead of going back to room3 via room4, perhaps there's another path. But no, all doors are locked except the ones we've unlocked.

Another angle: perhaps when moving blue_box_1, combine it with moving yellow_ball_2. But since you can only carry one object at a time, you have to make separate trips.

Alternatively, maybe after step9 (in room1), instead of immediately going to pick red_ball_1, first go back to room3, pick blue_box_1 and yellow_ball_2, but can't carry both. So pick blue_box_1 first, bring to room1, then go back for yellow_ball_2.

But this also requires multiple steps.

Given that the problem asks for an optimal plan, perhaps the minimal steps are around 30-40 actions. But maybe there's a way to avoid some back-and-forth.

Wait, after step9 (in room1), if I can bring blue_box_1 first, then handle the room2 constraints.

Alternatively, here's a shorter plan:

1. goto yellow_door_1 in room2 and unlock it.
2. go to room4.
3. goto purple_door_1, unlock, go to room3.
4. unlock grey_door_1, go to room1.
5. pick red_ball_1.
6. go back to room3, room4, room2, drop red_ball_1.
7. go back to room3, pick yellow_ball_2, bring to room2.
8. go back to room1 via room3.
9. goto purple_box_1.

But this skips moving blue_box_1 to room1. But the constraint requires that blue_box_1 is in room1 at some point. So need to do that.

So inserting steps after step4:

5. go back to room3, pick blue_box_1, drop in room1.
6. pick red_ball_1, bring to room2.
7. pick yellow_ball_2, bring to room2.
8. go to room1.

This adds steps. But perhaps the order is different.

Alternatively, here's a possible optimized plan:

1. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room2 room4
2. toggle yellow_door_1
3. gotoroom room2 room4 yellow_door_1
4. gotodoor purple_door_1 room4 room3
5. toggle purple_door_1
6. gotoroom room4 room3 purple_door_1
7. gotodoor grey_door_1 room3 room1
8. toggle grey_door_1
9. gotoroom room3 room1 grey_door_1
10. gotoobject blue_box_1 room3 (wait, blue_box_1 is in room3. But I'm in room1 now. Can't go to room3's objects while in room1.)

Ah, right, so after step9, I'm in room1. So to get blue_box_1 from room3 to room1, I need to:

10. gotodoor grey_door_1 room1 room3
11. gotoroom room1 room3 grey_door_1
12. gotoobject blue_box_1 room3
13. pick blue_box_1
14. gotodoor grey_door_1 room3 room1
15. gotoroom room3 room1 grey_door_1
16. drop blue_box_1 room1

Now, blue_box_1 is in room1.

Then, pick red_ball_1:

17. gotoobject red_ball_1 room1
18. pick red_ball_1
19. gotodoor grey_door_1 room1 room3
20. gotoroom room1 room3 grey_door_1
21. gotodoor purple_door_1 room3 room4
22. gotoroom room3 room4 purple_door_1
23. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room4 room2
24. gotoroom room4 room2 yellow_door_1
25. drop red_ball_1 room2

Now, red_ball_1 is in room2.

Then, go back to room3 to get yellow_ball_2:

26. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room2 room4
27. gotoroom room2 room4 yellow_door_1
28. gotodoor purple_door_1 room4 room3
29. gotoroom room4 room3 purple_door_1
30. gotoobject yellow_ball_2 room3
31. pick yellow_ball_2
32. gotodoor purple_door_1 room3 room4
33. gotoroom room3 room4 purple_door_1
34. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room4 room2
35. gotoroom room4 room2 yellow_door_1
36. drop yellow_ball_2 room2

Now, both red_ball_1 and yellow_ball_2 are in room2. Now, need to go to room1:

37. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room2 room4
38. gotoroom room2 room4 yellow_door_1
39. gotodoor purple_door_1 room4 room3
40. gotoroom room4 room3 purple_door_1
41. gotodoor grey_door_1 room3 room1
42. gotoroom room3 room1 grey_door_1
43. gotoobject purple_box_1 room1

This plan has 43 actions. But maybe there's a way to shorten it.

Wait, after step25 (drop red_ball_1 in room2), I'm in room2. So I can directly go to room4 and then room3 to pick yellow_ball_2. Steps 26-36 are needed.

But perhaps when I'm in room2 after step25, I can go to room4, then room3, pick yellow_ball_2, bring back to room2. Then, go to room1.

But this is what's already in the plan.

Alternatively, after step36 (drop yellow_ball_2 in room2), I can go back to room1 via room4 and room3. But that's what steps37-42 do.

But this seems necessary.

Given that, I think this is the minimal plan given the constraints. The problem requires that all constraints are met, and this plan does that. Although it's long, it's necessary due to the constraints.

Now, let's write the plan in the required format, listing each action on a separate line.

```
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_4
toggle yellow_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_4 yellow_door_1
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_3
toggle purple_door_1
gotoroom room_4 room_3 purple_door_1
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1
toggle grey_door_1
gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_3
gotoroom room_1 room_3 grey_door_1
gotoobject blue_box_1 room_3
pick blue_box_1 room_3
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1
gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1
drop blue_box_1 room_1
gotoobject red_ball_1 room_1
pick red_ball_1 room_1
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_3
gotoroom room_1 room_3 grey_door_1
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_4
gotoroom room_3 room_4 purple_door_1
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_2
gotoroom room_4 room_2 yellow_door_1
drop red_ball_1 room_2
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_4
gotoroom room_2 room_4 yellow_door_1
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_3
gotoroom room_4 room_3 purple_door_1
gotoobject yellow_ball_2 room_3
pick yellow_ball_2 room_3
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_4
gotoroom room_3 room_4 purple_door_1
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_2
gotoroom room_4 room_2 yellow_door_1
drop yellow_ball_2 room_2
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_4
gotoroom room_2 room_4 yellow_door_1
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_3
gotoroom room_4 room_3 purple_door_1
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1
gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1
gotoobject purple_box_1 room_1
```

This plan has 37 actions, which seems a bit shorter than previous counts, but I might have miscounted. However, this plan meets all the constraints and achieves the goal. The key is to ensure that all required objects are moved and doors are toggled as needed.
