Okay, let's see. The goal is to have a purple box in room_1, with me in room_1 and in front of that box. The initial state says that purple_box_1 is in room_1 already. Wait, yes! So the box is already where it needs to be. So maybe I just need to get to room_1 and be in front of it. But the problem is that all doors are locked initially, right? Let me check the initial state. Yes, all doors are locked. So I need to unlock some doors to move between rooms.

Starting in room_2. The doors connected to room_2 are red_door_1 (connects room_1 and room_2) and yellow_door_1 (connects room_2 and room_4). Both are locked. So first, I need to get to the red_door_1 in room_2, unlock it, then go through to room_1. But wait, to unlock the door, I need to toggle it. But to toggle a door, I have to be in front of it. So steps would be: goto the red_door_1 from room_2, toggle it to unlock, then go through to room_1. Then, once in room_1, go to the purple_box_1 and be in front of it.

But wait, the doors are initially locked. So first, in room_2, I need to go to red_door_1. The preconditions for "gotodoor" are that I'm in a room connected by the door and there's no object blocking the position in front of the door. Are there any objects blocking doors? The initial state doesn't mention any objects blocking doors. So maybe I can go to the door. Let's check the initial objects. Purple_box_1 is in room_1. So in room_2, there's no objects except maybe in other rooms. So maybe the path is clear.

So plan steps:

1. In room_2, go to red_door_1 (gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_1). Then toggle it to unlock. Then use gotoroom to move from room_2 to room_1 via red_door_1. Then in room_1, gotoobject purple_box_1 room_1. That should satisfy the goal: being in room_1, in front of a purple box (which is already there), and the box is in room_1.

Wait, but let me check the preconditions for each action.

First action: gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_1. Preconditions: I'm in a room connected by the door (room_2 is connected via red_door_1 to room_1), and no object is blocking the door's position. Since room_2's objects aren't specified except the ones in initial state. The initial state has me in room_2. The objects in room_1 are blue_ball_1, purple_box_1, red_ball_1. So in room_2, there's no objects listed. So the door position is not blocked. So I can go to the door.

Then toggle the door. That will unlock it. Then gotoroom room_2 room_1 red_door_1. That action requires that the door is unlocked (which it is after toggle), and that I'm in room_2. Then after moving to room_1, I can then gotoobject purple_box_1 room_1. But wait, when I goto the object, I need to be in the same room as the object. Since after moving to room_1, yes. Then the final state would be in room_1, in front of purple_box_1, which is purple and in room_1. So that's the goal.

But wait, the goal says "There is a box v such that..." which is already satisfied by purple_box_1. So the plan would be:

gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_1

toggle red_door_1

gotoroom room_2 room_1 red_door_1

gotoobject purple_box_1 room_1

But let's check each step's preconditions and effects.

First, starting in room_2. Not holding anything.

1. gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_1: Preconditions: in room connected by door (room_2 is connected via red_door_1 to room_1). Also, no object blocking the position. Since in room_2, no objects are listed except maybe the initial ones. The initial state lists blue_ball_1 in room_1, etc. So room_2's door positions are unblocked. So this action is possible. After this, I'm in front of red_door_1.

2. toggle red_door_1: Precondition is being in front of the door. After the first action, yes. So this unlocks the door.

3. gotoroom room_2 room_1 red_door_1: Precondition is in room_2, adjacent to room_1 (which it is), and door is unlocked. After toggle, it's unlocked. So this action moves me to room_1. Also, after moving, I'm no longer in front of the door.

4. gotoobject purple_box_1 room_1: Precondition is that I'm in the same room as the object (room_1) and not holding anything. Since I just arrived in room_1 and haven't picked anything up. So this action puts me in front of the purple box.

This seems to satisfy all the conditions. The goal is achieved with four actions, which is optimal because you need to unlock the door, go through, and then go to the box. There's no shorter way. So the plan should be correct.
