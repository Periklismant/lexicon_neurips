Let me break down the planning problem:

Initial State:
- You are in room_1
- Objects in room_1: purple_ball_1, purple_box_1, yellow_box_1
- Objects in room_2: yellow_box_2
- Objects in room_3: grey_ball_1
- Objects in room_4: green_box_1, green_box_2, blue_ball_1
- All doors (green_door_1, yellow_door_1, yellow_door_2, blue_door_1) are locked
- The doors connect the rooms as follows:
  - green_door_1 connects room_1 and room_2
  - yellow_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3
  - yellow_door_2 connects room_2 and room_4
  - blue_door_1 connects room_3 and room_4
- You have visited room_1
- Your hands are empty

Goal:
- You are in room_4
- There is a green box in room_4
- You are in front of the green box

Given that there are two green boxes (green_box_1 and green_box_2) already in room_4, we need to:
1. Navigate to room_4
2. Go in front of either green_box_1 or green_box_2

To navigate to room_4, we need to:
1. Go to a door connecting room_1 to another room
2. Unlock the door
3. Go through the door to the next room
4. Repeat until we reach room_4

Since all doors are locked, we need to toggle them to unlock them.

Let's determine the shortest path from room_1 to room_4:

Path 1: room_1 → room_2 (via green_door_1) → room_4 (via yellow_door_2)
Path 2: room_1 → room_3 (via yellow_door_1) → room_4 (via blue_door_1)

Both paths require going through two doors, so they are equally efficient. Let's choose Path 1.

Plan:
1. Go to green_door_1 from room_1
2. Unlock green_door_1
3. Go through green_door_1 to room_2
4. Go to yellow_door_2 from room_2
5. Unlock yellow_door_2
6. Go through yellow_door_2 to room_4
7. Go to either green_box_1 or green_box_2 in room_4

Let's now try to implement this plan with the given actions:

1. "gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_2" - Go to green_door_1 from room_1
2. "toggle green_door_1" - Unlock green_door_1
3. "gotoroom room_1 room_2 green_door_1" - Move from room_1 to room_2 through green_door_1
4. "gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_2 room_4" - Go to yellow_door_2 from room_2
5. "toggle yellow_door_2" - Unlock yellow_door_2
6. "gotoroom room_2 room_4 yellow_door_2" - Move from room_2 to room_4 through yellow_door_2
7. "gotoobject green_box_1 room_4" - Go to green_box_1 in room_4

Wait, there's a slight issue with the action format. Let me check the expected format again.

The action format is:
- "gotoobject x r": Go in front of an object x in room r.
- "gotoempty": Go in front of an empty position of the room, which does not contain any object.
- "gotodoor d r1 r2": Go in front of door d, connecting room r1 to room r2.
- "gotoroom r1 r2 d": Go to room r2 from room r1 using door d.
- "pick x r": Pick up object x in room r.
- "drop x r": Drop object x in room r.
- "toggle d": Unlock door d if is locked. Lock door d if is unlocked.

Let me update the plan:

1. "gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_2" - Go to green_door_1 from room_1
2. "toggle green_door_1" - Unlock green_door_1
3. "gotoroom room_1 room_2 green_door_1" - Move from room_1 to room_2 through green_door_1
4. "gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_2 room_4" - Go to yellow_door_2 from room_2
5. "toggle yellow_door_2" - Unlock yellow_door_2
6. "gotoroom room_2 room_4 yellow_door_2" - Move from room_2 to room_4 through yellow_door_2
7. "gotoobject green_box_1 room_4" - Go to green_box_1 in room_4

Actually, I think I'm still a bit confused about the action format. Let me review the domain definition once more.

"gotoobject x r": Go in front of to object x in room r.
Precondition: You may only go in front of an object x if you are in the same room as x.

"gotodoor d r1 r2": Go in front of door d, connecting room r1 to room r2.
Precondition: You may only go in front of a door d if (i) you are in a room which door d is connecting with another room, and (ii) there is no object blocking the position in front of d in the room you are currently in.

"gotoroom r1 r2 d": Go to room r2 from room r1 using door d.
Precondition: You may only go in a room r if (i) you are currently in a room r0 that is adjacent to r, and (ii) the door that is connecting r0 and r is unlocked.

"toggle d": Unlock door d if is locked. Lock door d if is unlocked.
Precondition: You may only toggle a door d if you are in front of d.

Based on these preconditions and the actions, let me rework the plan:

1. I'm in room_1.
2. "gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_2" - Go in front of green_door_1 from room_1
3. "toggle green_door_1" - Unlock green_door_1 (now it's unlocked)
4. "gotoroom room_1 room_2 green_door_1" - Move from room_1 to room_2 through green_door_1
5. Now I'm in room_2.
6. "gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_2 room_4" - Go in front of yellow_door_2 from room_2
7. "toggle yellow_door_2" - Unlock yellow_door_2 (now it's unlocked)
8. "gotoroom room_2 room_4 yellow_door_2" - Move from room_2 to room_4 through yellow_door_2
9. Now I'm in room_4.
10. "gotoobject green_box_1 room_4" - Go to green_box_1 in room_4

This should be a valid plan to achieve the goal, so let me check if there are any issues or if there's a more efficient way.

The goal is to be in room_4, in front of a green box. We accomplish this by following the plan above. There are two green boxes in room_4 (green_box_1 and green_box_2), and we choose to go in front of green_box_1, but going in front of green_box_2 would also satisfy the goal.

The plan seems efficient and valid. I've chosen one of the shortest paths to room_4 (requiring toggling and passing through two doors), and then I go in front of a green box to satisfy the goal.

Let's finalize:

1. "gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_2"
2. "toggle green_door_1"
3. "gotoroom room_1 room_2 green_door_1"
4. "gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_2 room_4"
5. "toggle yellow_door_2"
6. "gotoroom room_2 room_4 yellow_door_2"
7. "gotoobject green_box_1 room_4"

The required solution is:

```
gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_2
toggle green_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_2 green_door_1
gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_2 room_4
toggle yellow_door_2
gotoroom room_2 room_4 yellow_door_2
gotoobject green_box_1 room_4
```

Wait, I just realized the exact delimiter should be three "```" characters on both lines rather than the word "Plan" or "End of Plan". Let me fix that:

```
gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_2
toggle green_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_2 green_door_1
gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_2 room_4
toggle yellow_door_2
gotoroom room_2 room_4 yellow_door_2
gotoobject green_box_1 room_4
```

Actually, I need to double-check the domain definition again. 

Here's how I interpret the domain definition:

- "gotoobject x r": Go in front of object x in room r.
- "gotodoor d r1 r2": Go in front of door d, connecting room r1 to room r2.
- "gotoroom r1 r2 d": Go to room r2 from room r1 using door d.
- "toggle d": Unlock door d if is locked. Lock door d if is unlocked.

The preconditions for "gotodoor" specify that you must currently be in a room that the door is connecting with another room. So, when you're in room_1, you can go in front of green_door_1 (connecting room_1 and room_2) or yellow_door_1 (connecting room_1 and room_3).

I think the plan is valid, and the action format looks correct. Let's go with it.

Hmm, actually, let's take a closer look at the "gotodoor" action:

"gotodoor d r1 r2": Go in front of door d, connecting room r1 to room r2.
Precondition: You may only go in front of a door d if (i) you are in a room which door d is connecting with another room, and (ii) there is no object blocking the position in front of d in the room you are currently in.

For "gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_2", is this saying I'm going to the door that connects room_1 to room_2 (which is green_door_1) from room_1?

Let's double-check:

- "gotodoor d r1 r2" means go in front of door d, which connects room r1 and room r2
- You're already in a room (let's say room_1)
- If the door d connects your current room (room_1) with another room (room_2), you can go in front of door d

So the action "gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_2" means go in front of green_door_1, which connects room_1 and room_2, and you're doing this from room_1.

Similarly, "gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_2 room_4" means go in front of yellow_door_2, which connects room_2 and room_4, and you're doing this from room_2.

That seems correct with the domain definition. My plan uses "gotodoor" to position in front of a door, "toggle" to unlock the door, and "gotoroom" to move through the door to the other room.

Given all that, I'm pretty confident that my plan is valid:

```
gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_2
toggle green_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_2 green_door_1
gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_2 room_4
toggle yellow_door_2
gotoroom room_2 room_4 yellow_door_2
gotoobject green_box_1 room_4
```

Ah, I think I was overthinking and second-guessing myself. The action formats seem to align with what's described in the domain, and the plan seems valid:
1. Go to the door that connects room_1 and room_2 (green_door_1)
2. Unlock the door
3. Go through the door to room_2
4. Go to the door that connects room_2 and room_4 (yellow_door_2)
5. Unlock the door
6. Go through the door to room_4
7. Go in front of a green box in room_4

This plan satisfies the goal:
- You are in room_4
- There is a green box (green_box_1) in room_4
- You are in front of the green box

This looks right, so the final plan is:

```
gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_2
toggle green_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_2 green_door_1
gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_2 room_4
toggle yellow_door_2
gotoroom room_2 room_4 yellow_door_2
gotoobject green_box_1 room_4
```
