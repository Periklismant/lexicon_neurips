Let's analyze this planning problem:

Initial state:
- You are in room_1
- purple_ball_1 is in room_1
- purple_box_1 is in room_1
- yellow_box_1 is in room_1
- yellow_box_2 is in room_2
- grey_ball_1 is in room_3
- green_box_1 is in room_4
- green_box_2 is in room_4
- blue_ball_1 is in room_4
- All doors (green_door_1, yellow_door_1, yellow_door_2, blue_door_1) are locked
- You are not holding any object
- You have visited room_1

Goal state:
- There is a green box v in room_4
- You are in room_4
- You are in front of this green box v

Constraints:
1. At some point, either yellow_box_2 is in room_3 or you are holding an object
2. You are never in room_2
3. At some point, green_door_1 is unlocked
4. If green_door_1 is unlocked, then eventually you are in front of grey_ball_1
5. At some point, yellow_door_2 is unlocked
6. If yellow_door_2 is unlocked, then eventually you are holding green_box_1 or purple_ball_1
7. At some point, you are in front of empty AND green_box_1 is in room_1
8. At some point, green_door_1 is locked
9. If green_door_1 is locked, then eventually you are in front of blue_door_1 or holding some object
10. At some point, you are holding green_box_1
11. At some point, you are in room_1
12. If you are in room_1, then eventually you are in front of yellow_door_1
13. At some point, green_box_1 is in room_1
14. At some point, you are holding some object

Based on the goal, we need to get into room_4 and stand in front of a green box. There are two green boxes: green_box_1 and green_box_2, and both are initially in room_4.

Let's see if we can construct a path that satisfies all constraints:

1. We start in room_1
2. Constraint 2 prohibits us from entering room_2
3. Constraint 13 says that at some point, green_box_1 needs to be in room_1. This means we need to go to room_4, pick up green_box_1, and bring it to room_1
4. We cannot go through room_2 due to constraint 2, so we need to go from room_1 to room_3 to room_4
5. All doors are locked initially, so we need to unlock them
6. After we bring green_box_1 to room_1 (satisfying constraint 13), we need to eventually have green_box_1 in room_4 (from the goal)
7. Constraint 10 requires us to hold green_box_1 at some point, which aligns with our need to move it

Let me try to outline a plan:

1. From room_1, unlock yellow_door_1
2. Go to room_3
3. Go to grey_ball_1 (needed for constraint 4)
4. Unlock blue_door_1
5. Go to room_4
6. Pick up green_box_1 (satisfying constraint 10 and preparing for 13)
7. Go back to room_3
8. Go back to room_1
9. Drop green_box_1 in room_1 (satisfying constraint 13)
10. Ensure we're in front of empty with green_box_1 in room_1 (constraint 7)
11. Go to yellow_door_1 (constraint 12)
12. At some point, green_door_1 needs to be unlocked (constraint 3) and then locked again (constraint 8). Since we can't enter room_2, we need to do this from room_1.
13. At some point, yellow_door_2 needs to be unlocked (constraint 5). Since we can't enter room_2, we need to do this indirectly, likely by picking up an object (constraint 6).
14. Pick up green_box_1 again
15. Go back to room_3 and then to room_4
16. Drop green_box_1 in room_4
17. Stand in front of green_box_1 (completing the goal)

Let's revise this to ensure all constraints are met:

Constraint 5 requires yellow_door_2 to be unlocked. But since we can't enter room_2 (constraint 2), we can't directly interact with yellow_door_2. This is problematic.

Let me think more about the connections between the rooms and how we might address this. The world looks like:

```
room_1 --- yellow_door_1 --- room_3
   |                             |
green_door_1                 blue_door_1
   |                             |
room_2 --- yellow_door_2 --- room_4
```

The constraint says we can't be in room_2, but maybe we can unlock yellow_door_2 from room_4? If so, we'd go:
room_1 -> room_3 -> room_4 -> unlock yellow_door_2

Wait, looking at the constraint for yellow_door_2 being unlocked, it says we should hold either green_box_1 or purple_ball_1 after unlocking it. This aligns with our plan to pick up green_box_1.

Ok, let me think through this step by step again.

Let's see which constraints are easier to satisfy and start with those:

- Constraint 10 and 14 can be satisfied by picking up green_box_1.
- Constraint 13 requires green_box_1 to be in room_1 at some point. This means we need to bring it from room_4.
- Constraint 7 requires us to be in front of empty with green_box_1 in room_1.
- Constraint 11 and 12 requires us to be in room_1 and then in front of yellow_door_1.
- Constraint 3 and 8 require green_door_1 to be both unlocked and locked at different points.
- Constraint 4 says after unlocking green_door_1, we should be in front of grey_ball_1.
- Constraint 5 requires yellow_door_2 to be unlocked.
- Constraint 6 says after unlocking yellow_door_2, we should be holding green_box_1 or purple_ball_1.

For the goal, we need to have green_box_1 or green_box_2 in room_4, and be in front of it. Since green_box_1 needs to be in room_1 at some point, it might be more convenient to aim for green_box_2 for the goal. But then again, green_box_1 needs to be held at some point (Constraint 10), so maybe we should move green_box_1 to room_1 and then back to room_4.

Let's plan this step-by-step:

1. Start in room_1.
2. Go to yellow_door_1.
3. Unlock yellow_door_1.
4. Go to room_3 via yellow_door_1.
5. Go to blue_door_1.
6. Unlock blue_door_1.
7. Go to room_4 via blue_door_1.
8. Go to green_box_1.
9. Pick up green_box_1 (satisfying constraint 10 and 14).
10. Go to blue_door_1.
11. Go to room_3 via blue_door_1.
12. Go to yellow_door_1.
13. Go to room_1 via yellow_door_1.
14. Go to an empty position.
15. Drop green_box_1 (satisfying constraint 13).
16. Ensure we're in front of empty with green_box_1 in room_1 (satisfying constraint 7).
17. Go to yellow_door_1 (satisfying constraint 12).
18. Go to room_3 via yellow_door_1.
19. Go to grey_ball_1 (preparing for constraint 4).
20. Go to yellow_door_1.
21. Go to room_1 via yellow_door_1.
22. Go to green_door_1.
23. Unlock green_door_1 (satisfying constraint 3).
24. Go to yellow_door_1.
25. Go to room_3 via yellow_door_1.
26. Go to grey_ball_1 (satisfying constraint 4).
27. Go to blue_door_1.
28. Go to room_4 via blue_door_1.
29. Go to yellow_door_2.
30. Unlock yellow_door_2 (satisfying constraint 5).
31. Go to green_box_1.
32. Pick up green_box_1 (satisfying constraint 6).
33. Go to yellow_door_1.
34. Go to room_1 via room_3.
35. Go to green_door_1.
36. Lock green_door_1 (satisfying constraint 8).
37. We are now holding green_box_1, which satisfies constraint 9.
38. Go to yellow_door_1.
39. Go to room_3 via yellow_door_1.
40. Go to blue_door_1.
41. Go to room_4 via blue_door_1.
42. Drop green_box_1.
43. Stand in front of green_box_1 (satisfying the goal).

The plan above should satisfy all the constraints and achieve the goal. However, there are several nuances I need to account for to ensure the plan is valid:

1. Constraint 1 is satisfied either if yellow_box_2 is in room_3 at some point, or if we're holding an object. We're already holding green_box_1 several times in the plan, so this constraint is satisfied.
2. Constraint 2 says we should never be in room_2. The plan avoids room_2 altogether.
3. Constraint 9 is satisfied because after we lock green_door_1, we are holding green_box_1.

I notice that I was careless with the goto object and goto empty actions. They require the object or empty space to be in the same room as the agent. Let me revise the plan, ensuring the actions have proper arguments:

1. Start in room_1.
2. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3
3. toggle yellow_door_1
4. gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1
5. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_4
6. toggle blue_door_1
7. gotoroom room_3 room_4 blue_door_1
8. gotoobject green_box_1 room_4
9. pick green_box_1 room_4
10. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_4 room_3
11. gotoroom room_4 room_3 blue_door_1
12. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1
13. gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_1
14. gotoempty
15. drop green_box_1 room_1
16. gotoempty
17. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3
18. gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1
19. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_3
20. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1
21. gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_1
22. gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_2
23. toggle green_door_1
24. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3
25. gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1
26. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_3
27. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_4
28. gotoroom room_3 room_4 blue_door_1
29. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_2
30. toggle yellow_door_2
31. gotoobject green_box_1 room_1
32. oops, I can't do this because green_box_1 is in room_1 and I'm in room_4.

Let me revise the plan:

1. Start in room_1.
2. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3
3. toggle yellow_door_1 (unlock)
4. gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1
5. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_4
6. toggle blue_door_1 (unlock)
7. gotoroom room_3 room_4 blue_door_1
8. gotoobject green_box_1 room_4
9. pick green_box_1 room_4
10. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_4 room_3
11. gotoroom room_4 room_3 blue_door_1
12. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1
13. gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_1
14. gotoempty
15. drop green_box_1 room_1
16. gotoempty (satisfying constraint 7)
17. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3 (satisfying constraint 12)
18. gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1
19. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_3
20. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1
21. gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_1
22. gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_2
23. toggle green_door_1 (unlock, satisfying constraint 3)
24. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3
25. gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1
26. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_3 (satisfying constraint 4)
27. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_4
28. gotoroom room_3 room_4 blue_door_1
29. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_2
30. toggle yellow_door_2 (unlock, satisfying constraint 5)
31. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_4 room_3
32. gotoroom room_4 room_3 blue_door_1
33. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1
34. gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_1
35. gotoobject green_box_1 room_1
36. pick green_box_1 room_1 (satisfying constraint 6)
37. gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_2
38. toggle green_door_1 (lock, satisfying constraint 8)
39. (We are holding green_box_1, which satisfies constraint 9)
40. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3
41. gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1
42. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_4
43. gotoroom room_3 room_4 blue_door_1
44. gotoempty
45. drop green_box_1 room_4
46. gotoobject green_box_1 room_4 (satisfying the goal)

Let me double check that this plan satisfies all constraints:

1. Constraint 1: "At some point, either yellow_box_2 is in room_3 or you are holding an object". This is satisfied as we hold green_box_1 multiple times in the plan.
2. Constraint 2: "You are never in room_2". We never enter room_2 in the plan.
3. Constraint 3: "At some point, green_door_1 is unlocked". We unlock green_door_1 in step 23.
4. Constraint 4: "If green_door_1 is unlocked, then eventually you are in front of grey_ball_1". We stand in front of grey_ball_1 in step 26, after unlocking green_door_1 in step 23.
5. Constraint 5: "At some point, yellow_door_2 is unlocked". We unlock yellow_door_2 in step 30.
6. Constraint 6: "If yellow_door_2 is unlocked, then eventually you are holding green_box_1 or purple_ball_1". We pick up green_box_1 in step 36, after unlocking yellow_door_2 in step 30.
7. Constraint 7: "At some point, you are in front of empty AND green_box_1 is in room_1". This is satisfied in step 16, after dropping green_box_1 in room_1 and going to an empty position.
8. Constraint 8: "At some point, green_door_1 is locked". We lock green_door_1 back in step 38.
9. Constraint 9: "If green_door_1 is locked, then eventually you are in front of blue_door_1 or holding some object". After locking green_door_1 in step 38, we are holding green_box_1.
10. Constraint 10: "At some point, you are holding green_box_1". We pick up green_box_1 in steps 9 and 36.
11. Constraint 11: "At some point, you are in room_1". We start in room_1 and return to it multiple times.
12. Constraint 12: "If you are in room_1, then eventually you are in front of yellow_door_1". After returning to room_1, we go in front of yellow_door_1 in step 17.
13. Constraint 13: "At some point, green_box_1 is in room_1". We drop green_box_1 in room_1 in step 15.
14. Constraint 14: "At some point, you are holding some object". We hold green_box_1 multiple times.

All constraints are satisfied, and the plan achieves the goal of having a green box (green_box_1) in room_4 and standing in front of it.

Let me check if the plan can be optimized:

Actually, steps 28-30 (going to and unlocking yellow_door_2) could be skipped, and instead, we could just go to green_box_2 in room_4 and use that for the goal. However, constraint 5 specifically requires yellow_door_2 to be unlocked, so we need to keep these steps.

Oh, wait. When we return to room_1 after unlocking yellow_door_2, we pick up green_box_1 and lock green_door_1. This is correct based on the constraints, but something that's redundant is that we then take green_box_1 back to room_4, instead of just using green_box_2 which is already in room_4 for the goal. 

Let's revise the plan to be more optimal:

1. Start in room_1.
2. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3
3. toggle yellow_door_1 (unlock)
4. gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1
5. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_3 (preparing for constraint 4)
6. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_4
7. toggle blue_door_1 (unlock)
8. gotoroom room_3 room_4 blue_door_1
9. gotoobject green_box_1 room_4
10. pick green_box_1 room_4 (satisfying constraint 10 and 14)
11. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_4 room_3
12. gotoroom room_4 room_3 blue_door_1
13. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1
14. gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_1
15. gotoempty
16. drop green_box_1 room_1 (satisfying constraint 13)
17. gotoempty (satisfying constraint 7)
18. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3 (satisfying constraint 12)
19. gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1
20. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_3
21. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1
22. gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_1
23. gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_2
24. toggle green_door_1 (unlock, satisfying constraint 3)
25. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3
26. gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1
27. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_3 (satisfying constraint 4)
28. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_4
29. gotoroom room_3 room_4 blue_door_1
30. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_2
31. toggle yellow_door_2 (unlock, satisfying constraint 5)
32. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_4 room_3
33. gotoroom room_4 room_3 blue_door_1
34. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1
35. gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_1
36. gotoobject green_box_1 room_1
37. pick green_box_1 room_1 (satisfying constraint 6)
38. gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_2
39. toggle green_door_1 (lock, satisfying constraint 8)
40. (We are holding green_box_1, which satisfies constraint 9)
41. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3
42. gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1
43. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_4
44. gotoroom room_3 room_4 blue_door_1
45. gotoempty
46. drop green_box_1 room_4
47. gotoobject green_box_1 room_4 (satisfying the goal)

Actually, is there a way I can optimize this further? Let me rethink this:

The major constraints are:

1. We need to get green_box_1 from room_4 to room_1 at some point.
2. We need to unlock and then lock green_door_1.
3. After unlocking green_door_1, we need to stand in front of grey_ball_1.
4. We need to unlock yellow_door_2.
5. After unlocking yellow_door_2, we need to hold green_box_1 or purple_ball_1.
6. We need a green box in room_4 at the end.

I think we can reduce some steps by:
1. After unlocking green_door_1, immediately going to grey_ball_1 without an extra trip.
2. After unlocking yellow_door_2, considering if we can combine the requirement to hold green_box_1 with our need to bring it back to room_4.

Let me optimize the plan:

1. Start in room_1.
2. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3
3. toggle yellow_door_1 (unlock)
4. gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1
5. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_4
6. toggle blue_door_1 (unlock)
7. gotoroom room_3 room_4 blue_door_1
8. gotoobject green_box_1 room_4
9. pick green_box_1 room_4 (satisfying constraint 10 and 14)
10. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_4 room_3
11. gotoroom room_4 room_3 blue_door_1
12. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1
13. gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_1
14. gotoempty
15. drop green_box_1 room_1 (satisfying constraint 13)
16. gotoempty (satisfying constraint 7)
17. gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_2
18. toggle green_door_1 (unlock, satisfying constraint 3)
19. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3 (satisfying constraint 12)
20. gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1
21. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_3 (satisfying constraint 4)
22. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_4
23. gotoroom room_3 room_4 blue_door_1
24. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_2
25. toggle yellow_door_2 (unlock, satisfying constraint 5)
26. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_4 room_3
27. gotoroom room_4 room_3 blue_door_1
28. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1
29. gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_1
30. gotoobject green_box_1 room_1
31. pick green_box_1 room_1 (satisfying constraint 6)
32. gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_2
33. toggle green_door_1 (lock, satisfying constraint 8)
34. (We are holding green_box_1, which satisfies constraint 9)
35. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3
36. gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1
37. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_4
38. gotoroom room_3 room_4 blue_door_1
39. gotoempty
40. drop green_box_1 room_4
41. gotoobject green_box_1 room_4 (satisfying the goal)

This plan is now optimized by combining a couple of steps from the previous plan.

Let's do a final check for any other optimizations:

Constraing 12 says "if you are in room_1, then eventually you are in front of yellow_door_1". In the initial state, we're in room_1. So, I've added specific steps for this. However, the spirit of the constraint is that we'll reach it if we stay true to the plan since we'll go to yellow_door_1 anyways.

Hmm, there's actually a bug in my plan. In step 7, we're in room_3 (after going through unlocked yellow_door_1) and going to blue_door_1. Then we want to go from room_3 to room_4 using this blue_door_1. So, we need to first unlock blue_door_1.

Let me correct:

1. Start in room_1.
2. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3
3. toggle yellow_door_1 (unlock)
4. gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1
5. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_4
6. toggle blue_door_1 (unlock)
7. gotoroom room_3 room_4 blue_door_1
8. gotoobject green_box_1 room_4
9. pick green_box_1 room_4 (satisfying constraint 10 and 14)
10. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_4 room_3
11. gotoroom room_4 room_3 blue_door_1
12. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1
13. gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_1
14. gotoempty
15. drop green_box_1 room_1 (satisfying constraint 13)
16. gotoempty (satisfying constraint 7)
17. gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_2
18. toggle green_door_1 (unlock, satisfying constraint 3)
19. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3 (satisfying constraint 12)
20. gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1
21. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_3 (satisfying constraint 4)
22. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_4
23. gotoroom room_3 room_4 blue_door_1
24. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_2
25. toggle yellow_door_2 (unlock, satisfying constraint 5)
26. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_4 room_3
27. gotoroom room_4 room_3 blue_door_1
28. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1
29. gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_1
30. gotoobject green_box_1 room_1
31. pick green_box_1 room_1 (satisfying constraint 6)
32. gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_2
33. toggle green_door_1 (lock, satisfying constraint 8)
34. (We are holding green_box_1, which satisfies constraint 9)
35. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3
36. gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1
37. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_4
38. gotoroom room_3 room_4 blue_door_1
39. gotoempty
40. drop green_box_1 room_4
41. gotoobject green_box_1 room_4 (satisfying the goal)

I believe this is the final, optimized plan that satisfies all constraints and reaches the goal.

Let me, one last time, review the plan to ensure all constraints are met:

1. Constraint 1: "At some point, either yellow_box_2 is in room_3 or you are holding an object". This is satisfied as we hold green_box_1 multiple times in the plan.
2. Constraint 2: "You are never in room_2". We never enter room_2 in the plan.
3. Constraint 3: "At some point, green_door_1 is unlocked". We unlock green_door_1 in step 18.
4. Constraint 4: "If green_door_1 is unlocked, then eventually you are in front of grey_ball_1". We stand in front of grey_ball_1 in step 21, after unlocking green_door_1 in step 18.
5. Constraint 5: "At some point, yellow_door_2 is unlocked". We unlock yellow_door_2 in step 25.
6. Constraint 6: "If yellow_door_2 is unlocked, then eventually you are holding green_box_1 or purple_ball_1". We pick up green_box_1 in step 31, after unlocking yellow_door_2 in step 25.
7. Constraint 7: "At some point, you are in front of empty AND green_box_1 is in room_1". This is satisfied in step 16, after dropping green_box_1 in room_1 and going to an empty position.
8. Constraint 8: "At some point, green_door_1 is locked". We lock green_door_1 back in step 33.
9. Constraint 9: "If green_door_1 is locked, then eventually you are in front of blue_door_1 or holding some object". After locking green_door_1 in step 33, we are holding green_box_1.
10. Constraint 10: "At some point, you are holding green_box_1". We pick up green_box_1 in steps 9 and 31.
11. Constraint 11: "At some point, you are in room_1". We start in room_1 and return to it multiple times.
12. Constraint 12: "If you are in room_1, then eventually you are in front of yellow_door_1". After returning to room_1, we go in front of yellow_door_1 in step 19.
13. Constraint 13: "At some point, green_box_1 is in room_1". We drop green_box_1 in room_1 in step 15.
14. Constraint 14: "At some point, you are holding some object". We hold green_box_1 multiple times.

The goal, of having a green box in room_4 and standing in front of it, is achieved in step 40 and 41.

Wait, I made an error. In step 14, I used "gotoempty" but I should be more specific about the action. According to the domain description, it's just "gotoempty" with no further arguments. Let me correct that.

1. Start in room_1.
2. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3
3. toggle yellow_door_1
4. gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1
5. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_4
6. toggle blue_door_1
7. gotoroom room_3 room_4 blue_door_1
8. gotoobject green_box_1 room_4
9. pick green_box_1 room_4
10. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_4 room_3
11. gotoroom room_4 room_3 blue_door_1
12. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1
13. gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_1
14. gotoempty
15. drop green_box_1 room_1
16. gotoempty
17. gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_2
18. toggle green_door_1
19. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3
20. gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1
21. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_3
22. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_4
23. gotoroom room_3 room_4 blue_door_1
24. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_2
25. toggle yellow_door_2
26. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_4 room_3
27. gotoroom room_4 room_3 blue_door_1
28. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1
29. gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_1
30. gotoobject green_box_1 room_1
31. pick green_box_1 room_1
32. gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_2
33. toggle green_door_1
34. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3
35. gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1
36. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_4
37. gotoroom room_3 room_4 blue_door_1
38. gotoempty
39. drop green_box_1 room_4
40. gotoobject green_box_1 room_4

I believe this is the final, corrected plan.
