Okay, let me try to figure out this planning problem. So, the goal is to have a green box in room_4, with me in room_4 and in front of it. The constraints are a bit complicated, so I need to make sure each one is satisfied.

First, let's look at the initial state. I'm in room_1, and there are some boxes and balls here. The green boxes are in room_4 (green_box_1 and green_box_2). The goal wants a green box in room_4, so maybe I need to be there with one of them. But wait, green_box_1 and green_box_2 are already in room_4. So maybe I just need to go to room_4 and be in front of one of them. But how do I get there?

The doors are all locked initially. The doors connecting rooms are green_door_1 (room_1 and room_2), yellow_door_1 (room_1 and room_3), yellow_door_2 (room_2 and room_4), blue_door_1 (room_3 and room_4). All are locked. So to move between rooms, I need to unlock doors. But the constraints say I can't be in room_2 at all. So any path through room_2 is off-limits. That means I can't go through green_door_1 (which connects to room_2), so the only way from room_1 is to go to room_3 via yellow_door_1, then to room_4 via blue_door_1. But those doors are also locked. So I need to unlock them.

But wait, the constraints require that green_door_1 is not locked in at least one state. But since I can't go to room_2, how can I unlock green_door_1? Because to toggle a door, I need to be in front of it. If green_door_1 connects room_1 and room_2, then to be in front of it in room_1, but then if I unlock it, the constraint says that after unlocking green_door_1, I must be in front of grey_ball_1 (which is in room_3) at some point. Hmm. But if I'm in room_1, and I unlock green_door_1, then I need to somehow get to room_3 to be in front of grey_ball_1. But maybe that's possible. Let's think.

But also, there's a constraint that if green_door_1 is unlocked in some state, then I must be in front of grey_ball_1 in that state or a later one. Grey_ball_1 is in room_3. So after unlocking green_door_1, I need to get to room_3 and go to grey_ball_1. But how? Because room_1 connects to room_3 via yellow_door_1, which is locked. So to get to room_3, I need to unlock yellow_door_1. But that's another door.

Wait, the constraints also say that I must have yellow_door_2 unlocked in some state. Yellow_door_2 connects room_2 and room_4, but since I can't enter room_2, maybe that's a problem. Unless unlocking it from room_4. But room_4 is connected to room_2 via yellow_door_2. So if I'm in room_4, can I go to the door connecting to room_2 and unlock it? But the problem is, if I unlock yellow_door_2, then the constraint says that in that state or later, I must be holding either green_box_1 or purple_ball_1. Green_box_1 is in room_4 initially. Purple_ball_1 is in room_1.

So maybe I need to plan a path that involves unlocking certain doors while satisfying all these constraints. Let's outline the steps:

1. Start in room_1. Need to unlock yellow_door_1 to get to room_3. But yellow_door_1 is locked. To unlock it, I need to be in front of it. So first, goto door yellow_door_1 in room_1, then toggle it. Then, go to room_3. Then, from room_3, unlock blue_door_1 to get to room_4.

But wait, the initial state says that all doors are locked. So steps could be:

- goto door yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3 (since I'm in room_1)
- toggle yellow_door_1 (unlocks it)
- gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1
- Now in room_3. Then go to blue_door_1 (door connecting to room_4)
- goto door blue_door_1 room_3 room_4
- toggle blue_door_1 (unlock)
- gotoroom room_3 room_4 blue_door_1
- Now in room_4. Then, goto object green_box_1 in room_4. Then, drop if needed, but the goal requires being in front of a green box in room_4. But green_box_1 is already there. So maybe just gotoobject green_box_1 room_4.

But the constraints require several things:

- At least one state where yellow_box_2 is in room_3 or I'm holding something. Since yellow_box_2 is in room_2 initially, which I can't go to. So maybe I need to pick up something to satisfy that.

Also, constraints:

- Must have green_door_1 unlocked in some state. But I can't go to room_2. How? Maybe I can unlock green_door_1 from room_1. Because green_door_1 connects room_1 and room_2. So in room_1, goto door green_door_1, toggle it (unlock), but then the constraint says that after unlocking it, I must be in front of grey_ball_1 (in room_3) at some point. So after unlocking green_door_1, I need to eventually get to room_3 and go to grey_ball_1.

So maybe the plan needs to include unlocking green_door_1, then later go to room_3 and goto grey_ball_1.

But if I first unlock yellow_door_1, go to room_3, unlock blue_door_1, go to room_4, then maybe go back to room_3, go to grey_ball_1. But that would require moving back and forth.

Alternatively, maybe I need to unlock green_door_1 first, then proceed through other doors, but without entering room_2.

Wait, but unlocking green_door_1 requires being in front of it in room_1. So:

Action: gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_2 (but room_2 is off-limits, but the action is allowed as long as I'm in a room connected by the door. Since I'm in room_1, which is connected via green_door_1, and there's no object blocking the position in front of the door. The initial state says that in room_1, there are purple_ball_1, purple_box_1, and yellow_box_1. Are any of these blocking the door? The problem says "there is no object blocking the position in front of d in the room you are currently in." So if the door's position is blocked by an object, then gotodoor is not possible. But the initial state doesn't mention any objects blocking doors. So assuming that doors are not blocked. So I can goto green_door_1 in room_1, toggle it (unlock), which satisfies the "green_door_1 is not locked" in some state. Then, according to the constraint, after that, I must be in front of grey_ball_1 at some point. So I need to reach room_3 and goto grey_ball_1.

But how? To get to room_3 from room_1, I need to go through yellow_door_1, which is locked. So I need to unlock yellow_door_1. So maybe:

1. goto door green_door_1 room_1 room_2
2. toggle green_door_1 (unlock)
   - Now, green_door_1 is unlocked. This satisfies the "green_door_1 is not locked" in some state.
   - Then, later, I must be in front of grey_ball_1. So need to get to room_3 and goto grey_ball_1.
3. goto door yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3
4. toggle yellow_door_1 (unlock)
5. gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1
6. Now in room_3. Then, goto door blue_door_1 room_3 room_4
7. toggle blue_door_1 (unlock)
8. gotoroom room_3 room_4 blue_door_1
9. Now in room_4. Then, to satisfy the goal, gotoobject green_box_1 room_4.
10. But also, need to satisfy the constraints:
    - At some state, green_door_1 is locked. So after unlocking it, maybe lock it again? But the constraint requires that if green_door_1 is locked in a state, then in that state or later, I must be in front of blue_door_1 or holding something. Let's see.

But the plan steps so far have green_door_1 unlocked. To satisfy the constraint that "green_door_1 is locked" in some state, perhaps we need to lock it again. So after step 2, we have it unlocked. Then, later, go back to it and lock it. But that would require going back to room_1. But after step 5, we're in room_3. To return to room_1, we need to go through yellow_door_1 again. Let's see.

Alternatively, maybe after unlocking green_door_1, we need to lock it again. But that would require being in front of it again. But if I'm in room_1, I can do that. So after step 2, maybe:

11. goto door green_door_1 room_1 room_2
12. toggle green_door_1 (lock it again)
    - Now, green_door_1 is locked. This satisfies the "green_door_1 is locked" in some state. Then, according to the constraint, if green_door_1 is locked in some state s, then in s or after, I must be in front of blue_door_1 or holding something. So after step 12, I need to either go to blue_door_1 (which is in room_3 or room_4) or hold something. But if I'm in room_1, how can I get to blue_door_1? I need to proceed to room_3 and then room_4.

This is getting complicated. Let's outline all the constraints again:

Constraints:

1. At least once: yellow_box_2 in room_3 or holding something. Since yellow_box_2 is in room_2, which we can't go to, so this must be achieved by holding something. So at some point, pick up an object.

2. Never be in room_2. So all actions must avoid room_2.

3. At least once: green_door_1 is unlocked. So step 2 (toggle green_door_1 to unlock) satisfies this.

4. If green_door_1 is unlocked in state s, then in s or after, be in front of grey_ball_1. So after unlocking green_door_1, need to go to room_3 and front of grey_ball_1.

5. At least once: yellow_door_2 is unlocked. But yellow_door_2 connects room_2 and room_4. Since we can't be in room_2, the only way to unlock yellow_door_2 is from room_4. So need to be in room_4, go to yellow_door_2 (door connecting to room_2), toggle it. Then, the constraint that if yellow_door_2 is unlocked, then in that state or later, hold green_box_1 or purple_ball_1. Since purple_ball_1 is in room_1, maybe we need to carry green_box_1 from room_4. But green_box_1 is in room_4 initially. So perhaps pick it up.

6. At least once: in front of empty and green_box_1 in room_1. So need to have green_box_1 moved to room_1. But green_box_1 starts in room_4. So we need to move it to room_1. But to do that, we need to carry it through rooms. From room_4 to room_3 (blue_door_1), then room_1 (yellow_door_1). But moving through doors requires them to be unlocked.

7. At least once: green_door_1 is locked. So after unlocking it, we need to lock it again.

8. If green_door_1 is locked in state s, then in s or after, be in front of blue_door_1 or holding something. So after locking green_door_1, we need to either go to blue_door_1 or pick up an object.

9. At least once: holding green_box_1. So pick up green_box_1.

10. At least once: in room_1. But we start there, so maybe need to return after leaving.

11. If in room_1 in state s, then in s or after, be in front of yellow_door_1. Since we start in room_1, but the initial visited is room_1. So when we leave room_1, do we need to return? Wait, the constraint says that if you are in room_1 in some state s, then in s or after, you must be in front of yellow_door_1. So the initial state is in room_1, so we need to be in front of yellow_door_1 at some point. So perhaps when we first leave room_1 via yellow_door_1, we have to go through it, which requires being in front of it. So maybe the initial steps must include going to yellow_door_1 and unlocking it.

12. At least once: green_box_1 in room_1. So need to move green_box_1 from room_4 to room_1.

13. At least once: holding some object. Which can be satisfied by picking up any object.

So putting this all together:

The steps need to:

- Unlock green_door_1 (to satisfy constraint 3), then lock it again (constraint 7).

- After unlocking green_door_1, go to grey_ball_1 in room_3 (constraint 4).

- Unlock yellow_door_2 from room_4, then hold green_box_1 (constraint 5 and 9).

- Move green_box_1 to room_1 (constraint 6).

- Be in room_1 again (constraint 10), then be in front of yellow_door_1 (constraint 11).

- Ensure that at some point, you are in front of empty and green_box_1 is in room_1 (constraint 6).

- Ensure that you hold some object (constraint 13) and green_box_1 (constraint 9).

Let me try to outline a possible plan:

1. Start in room_1.

2. goto door green_door_1 room_1 room_2 (precondition: in room_1, door connects to room_2, no object blocking)

3. toggle green_door_1 (unlock) → satisfies constraint 3.

4. Now, need to go to room_3 and front of grey_ball_1. So:

   goto door yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3

5. toggle yellow_door_1 (unlock)

6. gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1 → now in room_3.

7. goto object grey_ball_1 room_3 → satisfies constraint 4 (after unlocking green_door_1, we are in front of grey_ball_1)

8. Now, need to unlock blue_door_1 to get to room_4.

   goto door blue_door_1 room_3 room_4

9. toggle blue_door_1 (unlock)

10. gotoroom room_3 room_4 blue_door_1 → now in room_4.

11. Now, need to unlock yellow_door_2 from room_4.

    goto door yellow_door_2 room_4 room_2 (precondition: in room_4, door connects to room_2)

12. toggle yellow_door_2 (unlock) → satisfies constraint 5.

    Now, after this, need to hold green_box_1 or purple_ball_1. Since purple_ball_1 is in room_1, and we're in room_4, it's easier to pick up green_box_1.

13. goto object green_box_1 room_4

14. pick green_box_1 room_4 → now holding green_box_1 (satisfies constraint 9 and 13)

15. Now, need to move green_box_1 to room_1. To do that, go back through blue_door_1 to room_3, then through yellow_door_1 to room_1.

    gotoroom room_4 room_3 blue_door_1 → to room_3.

16. goto door yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1 (but wait, yellow_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3. So from room_3, goto door yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1.

17. toggle yellow_door_1 (it's already unlocked)

18. gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_1 → now in room_1.

19. Now, in room_1. The constraint 11 says if in room_1, must be in front of yellow_door_1. We arrived via yellow_door_1, so after gotoroom, we are in room_1 but not in front of anything. So need to go to yellow_door_1 again.

    goto door yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3

    → Now in front of yellow_door_1, satisfying constraint 11.

20. Now, need to drop green_box_1 in room_1 to satisfy constraint 6 (green_box_1 in room_1). But to drop, need to be in front of empty.

    gotoempty

21. drop green_box_1 room_1 → now green_box_1 is in room_1. This satisfies constraint 6 when we are in front of empty (step 20) and green_box_1 is in room_1 (after step 21).

22. Now, need to lock green_door_1 again to satisfy constraint 7.

    But we are in room_1. So:

    goto door green_door_1 room_1 room_2

23. toggle green_door_1 (lock) → now green_door_1 is locked. Satisfies constraint 7.

    Now, according to constraint 8, if green_door_1 is locked in state s (step 23), then in s or after, be in front of blue_door_1 or holding something. After step 23, we are not holding anything (since we dropped green_box_1). So need to go to blue_door_1 or hold something. But blue_door_1 is in room_3 and room_4. Since we're in room_1, the only way is to go back to room_3 and then to room_4.

    Alternatively, pick up another object in room_1. For example, pick up purple_ball_1.

24. goto object purple_ball_1 room_1

25. pick purple_ball_1 room_1 → now holding something. This satisfies the constraint 8 because after locking green_door_1, we are holding an object.

26. Now, need to go back to room_4 to be in front of a green box. But the goal is to be in room_4, in front of a green box. So:

    goto door yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3

27. gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1 → room_3.

28. goto door blue_door_1 room_3 room_4

29. gotoroom room_3 room_4 blue_door_1 → room_4.

30. Now, drop purple_ball_1 if needed, but the goal requires being in front of a green box. Since green_box_1 is in room_1, but green_box_2 is in room_4. So:

    goto object green_box_2 room_4

    → Now in front of green_box_2. The goal requires a green box in room_4 (which it is), you in room_4, and in front of it. So this satisfies the goal.

But wait, the goal is "There is a box v such that v is green, in room_4, you are in room_4, and in front of v." So green_box_2 is in room_4. So step 30 would be the final step.

But let's check all constraints again:

- Constraint 1: at least once yellow_box_2 in room_3 or holding something. We were holding green_box_1 and purple_ball_1, so satisfied.

- Constraint 2: never in room_2. All steps avoid room_2.

- Constraint 3: green_door_1 unlocked in step 3.

- Constraint 4: after step 3, we went to grey_ball_1 in step 7.

- Constraint 5: unlocked yellow_door_2 in step 12.

- Constraint 6: after step 21, green_box_1 is in room_1, and step 20 was in front of empty.

- Constraint 7: locked green_door_1 in step 23.

- Constraint 8: after locking green_door_1 (step 23), we picked up purple_ball_1 (step 25), so holding something.

- Constraint 9: held green_box_1 in steps 14-21.

- Constraint 10: were in room_1 initially and after step 18.

- Constraint 11: in room_1 (step 18), then step 19 goes to yellow_door_1.

- Constraint 12: green_box_1 in room_1 after step 21.

- Constraint 13: held objects in steps 14-21 and 25 onwards.

So this plan seems to satisfy all constraints. Let me check the steps again to ensure they are possible.

Step-by-step plan:

1. Initial state: room_1, not holding anything.

2. goto door green_door_1 room_1 room_2 → possible, as in room_1 and door connects.

3. toggle green_door_1 → unlock. Now green_door_1 is unlocked.

4. goto door yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3 → possible.

5. toggle yellow_door_1 → unlock.

6. gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1 → now in room_3.

7. goto object grey_ball_1 room_3 → possible.

8. goto door blue_door_1 room_3 room_4 → possible.

9. toggle blue_door_1 → unlock.

10. gotoroom room_3 room_4 blue_door_1 → in room_4.

11. goto door yellow_door_2 room_4 room_2 → possible.

12. toggle yellow_door_2 → unlock.

13. goto object green_box_1 room_4 → possible.

14. pick green_box_1 → now holding it.

15. gotoroom room_4 room_3 blue_door_1 → to room_3.

16. goto door yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1 → possible.

17. toggle yellow_door_1 → already unlocked, toggles to locked? Wait, the effect of toggle is to unlock if locked, lock if unlocked. So after step 5, yellow_door_1 is unlocked. Toggling it again would lock it. But step 17 is after step 15, which is after step 10. So in room_3, we need to go back to room_1. But door yellow_door_1 is already unlocked. So when we do gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_1, the door must be unlocked. So after step 5, it's unlocked. If we toggled it again, it would lock. But step 17: if we are in room_3, goto door yellow_door_1 and toggle it, that would lock it again. But then, when we try to go back to room_1, the door would be locked. So maybe step 17 is not necessary. Wait, step 16 is goto door yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1. Then, step 17 is toggle yellow_door_1. If it's unlocked, toggling would lock it. But after that, when trying to go to room_1, the door is locked. That would be a problem.

Wait, in step 15, we are in room_4, then go back to room_3 (step 15). Then, need to go back to room_1. But yellow_door_1 is still unlocked from step 5. So step 16: goto door yellow_door_1 in room_3. Then step 17: toggle would lock it, which is not desired. Because then, we can't go back. So maybe we don't need to toggle it again. So steps 16-18 would be:

16. goto door yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1

17. gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_1 → possible since door is unlocked.

Wait, step 17 should be gotoroom, not toggle. Wait, the steps after step 15:

15. gotoroom room_4 room_3 blue_door_1 → in room_3.

16. goto door yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1 → in front of yellow_door_1 in room_3.

17. gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_1 → move to room_1.

Because the door is already unlocked. So no need to toggle again. So the previous steps had an error. Let me correct that.

So after step 15:

15. gotoroom room_4 room_3 blue_door_1 → room_3.

16. goto door yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1 → front of door.

17. gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_1 → room_1.

Now, in room_1. Then step 18:

18. goto door yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3 → front of door.

19. Now, need to be in front of yellow_door_1 when in room_1. Which step 18 satisfies.

20. Then, gotoempty → front of empty.

21. drop green_box_1 room_1 → now green_box_1 is in room_1.

22. goto door green_door_1 room_1 room_2 → front of green_door_1.

23. toggle green_door_1 → lock it.

24. Now, need to satisfy constraint 8: after locking green_door_1, be in front of blue_door_1 or hold something. Since after step 23, we are not holding anything. So need to pick up something. So:

24. goto object purple_ball_1 room_1 → front of it.

25. pick purple_ball_1 room_1 → now holding.

26. Then, go back to room_4:

    goto door yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3 → front of door.

27. gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1 → room_3.

28. goto door blue_door_1 room_3 room_4 → front of door.

29. gotoroom room_3 room_4 blue_door_1 → room_4.

30. goto object green_box_2 room_4 → front of it. This achieves the goal.

Now, check all constraints again:

- Constraint 6: green_box_1 is in room_1 after step 21, and step 20 is gotoempty (front of empty). So satisfied.

- Constraint 5: unlocked yellow_door_2 in step 12. Then, after that, held green_box_1 (step 14), which satisfies the conditional constraint.

- Constraint 8: after locking green_door_1 (step 23), picked up purple_ball_1 (step 25), so holding something.

- The goal is achieved in step 30.

Now, is this plan optimal? Are there redundant steps? For example, after dropping green_box_1 in room_1, we pick up purple_ball_1 to satisfy holding something. But perhaps there's a shorter way. Let me see.

Alternatively, after dropping green_box_1 in room_1, we could pick up purple_box_1 or yellow_box_1 instead. But any object would do. The key is to hold something after locking green_door_1.

But this plan seems to work. Let's count the steps:

1. gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_2

2. toggle green_door_1

3. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3

4. toggle yellow_door_1

5. gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1

6. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_3

7. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_4

8. toggle blue_door_1

9. gotoroom room_3 room_4 blue_door_1

10. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_2

11. toggle yellow_door_2

12. gotoobject green_box_1 room_4

13. pick green_box_1 room_4

14. gotoroom room_4 room_3 blue_door_1

15. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1

16. gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_1

17. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3

18. gotoempty

19. drop green_box_1 room_1

20. gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_2

21. toggle green_door_1

22. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_1

23. pick purple_ball_1 room_1

24. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3

25. gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1

26. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_4

27. gotoroom room_3 room_4 blue_door_1

28. gotoobject green_box_2 room_4

That's 28 steps. Maybe we can shorten it. For example, after dropping green_box_1 in room_1, instead of picking up purple_ball_1, can we use another object? Or maybe after step 19 (drop), we can directly go to room_4 via the same path.

Wait, but after step 19, we are in room_1, holding nothing. To get to room_4 again, we need to go through room_3. But the doors are unlocked (yellow_door_1 was unlocked in step 4, but after step 17, we didn't lock it again. Wait, in the corrected steps, after step 16 (gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_1), the door remains unlocked. So when returning to room_3, we can use it again. So steps after dropping green_box_1:

19. drop green_box_1 room_1.

20. Lock green_door_1.

21. Pick up purple_ball_1.

22. Go back to room_3 and then to room_4.

But perhaps there's a shorter path. Let me think.

Another approach: after unlocking yellow_door_2 in step 12, we have to hold green_box_1 or purple_ball_1. We picked green_box_1 in step 13, which is correct. Then, moving it to room_1. But maybe after that, we can go directly to room_4 without needing to pick up purple_ball_1. But the constraint 8 requires that after locking green_door_1 (step 21), we must be in front of blue_door_1 or holding something. If after locking green_door_1, we are not holding anything, then we must be in front of blue_door_1. But blue_door_1 is in room_3 and room_4. So after locking green_door_1 (step 21), we need to go to room_3 or room_4 and be in front of blue_door_1.

But that would require more steps. So perhaps it's better to pick up an object in room_1 after locking green_door_1. Hence, the steps 22-23 (pick purple_ball_1) are necessary.

Alternatively, after step 19 (drop green_box_1), can we go to room_4 through another path? But how? From room_1, we can go to room_3 via yellow_door_1, then to room_4 via blue_door_1. So steps would be:

After step 19 (drop green_box_1):

20. goto door yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3

21. gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1

22. goto door blue_door_1 room_3 room_4

23. gotoroom room_3 room_4 blue_door_1

24. goto object green_box_2 room_4 → goal achieved.

But during this, after step 19, we locked green_door_1 in step 20 (original step 20 was locking). Wait, no. The step to lock green_door_1 is necessary to satisfy constraint 7. So the steps must include unlocking and then locking green_door_1.

So the initial steps are necessary. So perhaps the plan as outlined is the optimal one. I can't think of a shorter way. Let's proceed to write the plan in the required format.
