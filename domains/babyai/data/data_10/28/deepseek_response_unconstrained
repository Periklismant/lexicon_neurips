``` 

This plan unlocks the necessary doors to move from room_1 to room_2 and then to room_4. Upon reaching room_4, the agent navigates to the green box (already present in the initial state), fulfilling all goal conditions without violating any constraints (no green objects picked up). The sequence is optimal with 7 actions, matching the minimal steps required to traverse two locked doors and reach the target room/object.
