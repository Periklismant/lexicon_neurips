Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. The goal is to get a green box in room 4, be in room 4, and be in front of that box. The initial state has me in room 1 with some objects, and all doors are locked. The constraints are that I can't pick up any green objects. Hmm, so the green boxes in room 4 (green_box_1 and green_box_2) are already there. But I need to be in front of one of them in room 4. Wait, but I'm starting in room 1. So I need to navigate to room 4, which is connected via doors. Let me think about the door connections.

The doors are: green_door_1 connects room_1 and room_2. Yellow_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3. Yellow_door_2 connects room_2 and room_4. Blue_door_1 connects room_3 and room_4. All doors are locked initially. So to get to room 4 from room 1, I need to unlock some doors.

But how do I unlock the doors? The toggle action requires being in front of the door. But to get in front of the door, I need to be in a room connected by that door. For example, green_door_1 is between room_1 and room_2. So to toggle it, I need to be in room_1 or room_2 and go in front of it. But if there's an object blocking the door's position, I can't go there. Let me check the initial positions.

In room_1, there's purple_ball_1, purple_box_1, and yellow_box_1. Are any of these blocking the doors? The problem statement doesn't explicitly say where objects are located relative to doors. Wait, the 'gotoobject' action requires being in the same room as the object. So if I need to go to a door in room_1, like green_door_1 (connecting room_1 and room_2), I can do that only if there's no object blocking that position. But since the initial state doesn't mention any objects blocking doors, perhaps the doors are accessible. Wait, but the problem might be that objects are placed in front of doors. For example, if an object is in front of a door in the current room, then the "gotodoor" action can't be performed because the position is blocked. The preconditions for "gotodoor d r1 r2" require that there's no object blocking the position in front of d in the current room.

So I need to check if any objects are blocking the doors. Let's look at the initial state. In room_1, there are purple_ball_1, purple_box_1, yellow_box_1. Are any of these in front of a door? The problem statement doesn't specify exact positions, so maybe by default, objects are not blocking doors unless stated. Therefore, I can assume that the doors are accessible. So in room_1, I can go to green_door_1 (connecting to room_2) or yellow_door_1 (connecting to room_3). But all doors are locked. So I need to unlock them.

But to toggle a door, I need to be in front of it. So steps would be: go to the door, toggle it to unlock, then go through. But since all doors are locked, I can't move through them until they are unlocked. So let's plan a path from room_1 to room_4.

Possible paths from room_1 to room_4:

1. room_1 → room_2 via green_door_1 → room_4 via yellow_door_2. But both doors are locked. So I need to unlock green_door_1 first, then go to room_2, unlock yellow_door_2, then go to room_4.

2. room_1 → room_3 via yellow_door_1 → room_4 via blue_door_1. Both doors locked. Unlock yellow_door_1, go to room_3, unlock blue_door_1, go to room_4.

Which path is better? Let's see. Which doors need to be unlocked.

Option 1: Unlock green_door_1 (in room_1), go to room_2. Then in room_2, unlock yellow_door_2 (connecting to room_4), then go to room_4.

Option 2: Unlock yellow_door_1 (in room_1) to go to room_3. Then in room_3, unlock blue_door_1 to go to room_4.

But the green boxes are already in room_4, so perhaps either path works. Let's check which doors can be accessed without blocked positions. But the problem says that to "gotodoor", the current room must have the door connected to another room, and no object is blocking the door's position.

In room_1, the doors are green_door_1 (to room_2) and yellow_door_1 (to room_3). Are there any objects blocking these doors? Since the initial state doesn't mention any blocking, we can assume not. So I can go to either door, toggle it, then go through.

But wait, to toggle a door, I need to be in front of it. So first, in room_1, I need to "gotodoor" to green_door_1, then toggle it. Then "gotoroom" to room_2. Then in room_2, "gotodoor" yellow_door_2, toggle it, then go to room_4.

Alternatively, in room_1, "gotodoor" yellow_door_1, toggle it, then go to room_3. Then in room_3, "gotodoor" blue_door_1, toggle it, then go to room_4.

Which path is shorter? Let's see:

Option 1:

1. goto green_door_1 in room_1.

2. toggle green_door_1 (now unlocked).

3. go from room_1 to room_2 via green_door_1.

4. in room_2, goto yellow_door_2 (door to room_4).

5. toggle yellow_door_2 to unlock.

6. go from room_2 to room_4 via yellow_door_2.

Then in room_4, the green boxes are already there. So then I need to gotoobject one of the green boxes (green_box_1 or green_box_2). But the constraint is that the agent can't pick up any green objects. Wait, the problem's constraints are not listed here. Wait, looking back, the user mentioned "a valid plan for the abovementioned problem must abide by the following constraints:" but the constraints were not pasted. Wait, looking back at the user message, after the original state, the task is to bring about the goal, and then the constraints are mentioned. Wait, the user input is a bit cut off. Let me check again.

Wait, the user input says: "A valid plan for the abovementioned problem must abide by the following constraints:" but then there's no text after that. That's a problem. Wait, maybe the user made a mistake in pasting. But according to the original problem statement, the constraints are missing here. But since the user provided the initial state and the goal, maybe the constraints were omitted. Wait, looking at the problem description again, the user wrote:

"The task is to bring about the following situation: "There is a box v such that "The following conditions are all true: "v is green", "v is in room_4", "you are in room_4", "you are in front of v"""

A valid plan must abide by the following constraints:

But then nothing. That's a problem. Wait, perhaps the user forgot to include the constraints. But since the original problem mentions constraints, maybe they are in the user's input. Let me check again.

Wait, the user message after the original state says:

"A valid plan for the abovementioned problem must abide by the following constraints:

"

But nothing after that. So maybe there are no constraints? But the original problem mentioned constraints. Alternatively, perhaps the constraints were cut off. In that case, the problem is to reach the goal with the given actions, considering the preconditions and effects.

But given that the user's input ends the constraints section without listing them, perhaps it's a mistake. But proceeding, perhaps the only constraint is the one mentioned in the problem statement. Wait, the user wrote:

"Provided a planning problem, consisting of an initial state of the world, a final goal and a set of constraints, your task is to provide a valid sequence of actions that solves the planning problem, i.e., bringing about the goal of the problem while satisfying all constraints."

But in the problem given, the constraints are missing. Hmm. But looking back, maybe the constraints are part of the problem. Wait, looking again:

Wait, the user input after the original state says:

The task is to bring about the following situation:
	"There is a box v such that "The following conditions are all true: "v is green", "v is in room_4", "you are in room_4", "you are in front of v"""

A valid plan for the abovementioned problem must abide by the following constraints:

Then nothing. So perhaps the user intended to include constraints but forgot. Alternatively, maybe the constraints are in the problem description above. Wait, the problem mentioned "the following constraints" but none are listed. That complicates things. Without knowing the constraints, it's hard to proceed. But perhaps the user made a mistake, and the constraints are part of the problem. Let me recheck the original problem statement.

Wait, in the problem description provided by the user, after the initial state and the goal, it says:

"A valid plan for the abovementioned problem must abide by the following constraints:"

But there's nothing after that. Therefore, the user might have made an error, perhaps in pasting the problem. Without the constraints, it's impossible to know if there are any restrictions. However, given that the problem requires an optimal plan, and the user mentioned that the agent cannot pick up green objects (in the thought process), perhaps that's part of the constraints. Wait, in the original problem, perhaps the constraints were that the agent cannot pick up green objects. But how would the assistant know that? Since the user input is incomplete, perhaps it's an error. But given that the assistant has to work with the provided information, perhaps there are no constraints except the ones inherent in the actions' preconditions.

Wait, the original problem mentions "a set of constraints" but they are not provided. So maybe the constraints are not present, and the assistant should proceed without considering additional constraints beyond the action preconditions.

Assuming that, then the plan would be to navigate to room_4, which requires unlocking doors, and then go in front of a green box in room_4.

The green boxes are already in room_4 (green_box_1 and green_box_2). So the steps would be:

1. From room_1, unlock the necessary doors to reach room_4.

2. Navigate to room_4.

3. Go in front of a green box in room_4.

So the key is unlocking the doors. Let's consider the path options.

Option 1: room_1 → room_2 via green_door_1 → room_4 via yellow_door_2.

But green_door_1 is locked. So steps:

- In room_1, goto green_door_1 (room_1 and room_2 are connected via green_door_1). Then toggle to unlock it. Then go to room_2. Then in room_2, goto yellow_door_2 (connects to room_4). Toggle to unlock it, then go to room_4.

But in room_2, there's yellow_box_2. Are there any objects blocking yellow_door_2 in room_2? Since the initial state doesn't mention blocking, perhaps not. So possible steps:

Action sequence:

1. gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_2

2. toggle green_door_1

3. gotoroom room_1 room_2 green_door_1

4. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_2 room_4

5. toggle yellow_door_2

6. gotoroom room_2 room_4 yellow_door_2

7. gotoobject green_box_1 room_4 (assuming green_box_1 is in room_4)

But the goal is to be in front of a green box in room_4. Since green_box_1 and green_box_2 are already in room_4, I just need to be in front of one. So step 7 is to gotoobject either green_box_1 or green_box_2 in room_4.

Alternatively, after step 6, the agent is in room_4, not in front of any object. So step 7 is gotoobject green_box_1 room_4.

But wait, after step 6 (gotoroom room_2 room_4 yellow_door_2), the agent is in room_4. Then, to gotoobject green_box_1 in room_4, since they are in the same room, it's allowed.

This would be a valid plan. Let's check the actions:

1. gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_2: Preconditions: in room_1 (yes), door connects to another room (yes), no object blocking (assumed yes). Then toggle green_door_1 to unlock.

3. gotoroom room_1 to room_2 via green_door_1: door is now unlocked, so allowed.

Then in room_2, goto yellow_door_2 (connecting to room_4). Toggle to unlock. Then go to room_4. Then goto green_box_1.

That's 7 actions.

Option 2: room_1 → room_3 via yellow_door_1 → room_4 via blue_door_1.

Steps:

1. In room_1, goto yellow_door_1 (connects to room_3). Toggle to unlock.

2. gotoroom room_1 to room_3.

3. In room_3, goto blue_door_1 (connects to room_4). Toggle to unlock.

4. gotoroom room_3 to room_4.

5. gotoobject green_box_1 in room_4.

That's 5 actions. But wait, blue_door_1 is locked initially. So steps:

1. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3

2. toggle yellow_door_1 (unlocks)

3. gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1

4. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_4

5. toggle blue_door_1

6. gotoroom room_3 room_4 blue_door_1

7. gotoobject green_box_1 room_4

So 7 actions again. So same length.

Wait, but maybe there's a shorter path. Let me think again.

If I can unlock two doors in the same room? For example, in room_1, unlock both green_door_1 and yellow_door_1. But that's not helpful. The optimal path would be the one with the fewest steps.

Wait, but maybe there's another way. Let's think about whether any doors are already unlocked. No, all doors are locked initially. So each door that needs to be passed must be unlocked.

So regardless of the path, two doors need to be unlocked and passed. So each path requires 7 actions. But maybe one path has fewer steps. Let's count:

Option 1:

1. gotodoor green_door_1 room1 room2

2. toggle green_door_1

3. gotoroom room1 room2 green_door_1

4. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room2 room4

5. toggle yellow_door_2

6. gotoroom room2 room4 yellow_door_2

7. gotoobject green_box_1 room4

Total: 7 actions.

Option 2:

1. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room1 room3

2. toggle yellow_door_1

3. gotoroom room1 room3 yellow_door_1

4. gotodoor blue_door_1 room3 room4

5. toggle blue_door_1

6. gotoroom room3 room4 blue_door_1

7. gotoobject green_box_1 room4

Same number of steps. So either path is acceptable. But maybe the green boxes are already in room_4, so no need to move them. The goal is to be in front of any green box in room_4. So the plan is to reach room_4 and then gotoobject one of them.

But wait, the problem says "you are in front of v", where v is a green box in room_4. So the agent must end up in room_4 and in front of a green box there.

So the plan is to unlock two doors and navigate to room_4, then gotoobject.

Now, the constraints: the user mentioned in the thought process that the agent can't pick up any green objects. But in the problem statement as given, the constraints section is empty. If there are no constraints, then the plan is straightforward. But if there's a constraint not to pick up green objects, but since the goal doesn't require moving any boxes, the agent doesn't need to pick up the green boxes. So the plan is as above.

Therefore, the optimal plan would be either path. Let's pick the first one: through room_2.

Wait, but in room_1, after unlocking green_door_1, you go to room_2. Then in room_2, you have to unlock yellow_door_2. Are there any objects blocking yellow_door_2 in room_2? The initial state says yellow_box_2 is in room_2. If the yellow_box_2 is blocking the door, then the gotodoor action would fail. Because the precondition for gotodoor is that there is no object blocking the door's position in the current room.

But the problem statement doesn't specify object positions relative to doors, so we have to assume that objects are not blocking doors unless stated. But since the problem doesn't mention that, we can proceed under the assumption that they are not blocking. So the plan is possible.

Thus, the steps would be:

1. gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_2

2. toggle green_door_1

3. gotoroom room_1 room_2 green_door_1

4. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_2 room_4

5. toggle yellow_door_2

6. gotoroom room_2 room_4 yellow_door_2

7. gotoobject green_box_1 room_4

Alternatively, using the other path:

1. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3

2. toggle yellow_door_1

3. gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1

4. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_4

5. toggle blue_door_1

6. gotoroom room_3 room_4 blue_door_1

7. gotoobject green_box_1 room_4

Either way, seven steps.

But maybe there's a shorter path. Wait, can the agent go through room_1 to room_3, then to room_4 via blue_door_1. Let's count:

That path is also seven steps. So no shorter plan.

Therefore, the optimal plan has seven actions.
