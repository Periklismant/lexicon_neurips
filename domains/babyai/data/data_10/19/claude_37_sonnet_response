Let me analyze the problem step by step:

1. We need to solve a planning problem in a 2D gridworld with 4 rooms arranged in a square formation.
2. The agent can navigate between rooms using doors, pick up and drop objects, go to objects/doors, and toggle doors (lock/unlock).
3. The initial state is given, and we need to find a valid sequence of actions to reach the goal state.
4. We need to satisfy various constraints.

Let's start by understanding the goal:
"There is a box v such that 'The following conditions are all true: "v is grey", "v is in room_3", "you are in room_3", "you are in front of v'"

So our goal is:
- Be in room_3
- Have a grey box in room_3
- Be in front of that grey box

From the initial state, we have three grey boxes: grey_box_1 (in room_1), grey_box_2 (in room_2), and grey_box_3 (in room_3). So, the simplest way to achieve the goal seems to be to go to room_3, go in front of grey_box_3, and we're done!

However, we need to satisfy various constraints. Let's go through them:

1. "Either holding an object or green_ball_1 is in room_1" must be true at some point.
2. "green_door_1 is locked" must always be true.
3. "You are in front of green_door_1" must be true at some point.
4. Before being in front of green_door_1, you must be holding an object.
5. Either yellow_door_1 or red_door_1 must be unlocked at some point.
6. "You are in front of grey_box_3" must be true at some point (this aligns with our goal).
7. Before being in front of grey_box_3, either grey_box_1 is in room_2 or you are holding some object.
8. Either yellow_door_1 is unlocked or you are holding some object at some point.
9. "You are in room_1" must be true at some point (it's already true in the initial state).
10. After being in room_1, you must hold an object at some point.
11. "purple_box_1 is in room_3" must be true at some point.
12. "You are holding some object" must be true at some point.
13. "yellow_door_2 is not locked" must be true at some point.

Let's think about this strategically:

From the initial state, we're in room_1. We have grey_box_1 and red_box_1 in this room. Constraint 10 says that after being in room_1, we must hold an object at some point. So, let's pick up one of these boxes.

But before that, constraint 2 says that green_door_1 should always remain locked. Constraint 3 says we need to be in front of green_door_1 at some point, and constraint 4 says that before being in front of green_door_1, we must be holding an object. So, this suggests that we need to pick up an object, go in front of green_door_1, but not toggle it.

Constraint 5 says that either yellow_door_1 or red_door_1 must be unlocked at some point. Initially, all doors are locked, so we'll need to unlock one of them.

Constraint 7 says that before being in front of grey_box_3, either grey_box_1 is in room_2 or we are holding some object. Given that we'll be picking up an object anyway, this constraint can be satisfied by holding the object before going to grey_box_3.

Constraint 11 says that purple_box_1 must be in room_3 at some point. Initially, it's in room_4, so we'll need to move it.

Constraint 13 says yellow_door_2 must be unlocked at some point, so we'll need to toggle it.

Now, let's sketch a high-level plan:

1. Pick up an object in room_1 (either grey_box_1 or red_box_1).
2. Go in front of green_door_1 (but don't toggle it).
3. Go in front of yellow_door_1 and unlock it.
4. Go to room_2.
5. Potentially drop the object we're holding in room_2 to satisfy constraint 1 (moving the object from room_1 to room_2).
6. Go in front of red_door_1 and unlock it.
7. Go to room_4.
8. Pick up purple_box_1.
9. Go in front of yellow_door_2 and unlock it.
10. Go to room_3.
11. Drop purple_box_1 to satisfy constraint 11.
12. Go in front of grey_box_3 to satisfy constraint 6 and part of the goal.

Let me check if this plan satisfies all constraints:

Constraint 1: If we drop an object in room_2, then pick up green_ball_1 and move it to room_1, this will be satisfied.
Constraint 2: We never toggle green_door_1, so it remains locked.
Constraint 3: We go in front of green_door_1.
Constraint 4: Before going in front of green_door_1, we pick up an object.
Constraint 5: We unlock either yellow_door_1 or red_door_1.
Constraint 6: We go in front of grey_box_3.
Constraint 7: Before going in front of grey_box_3, we are holding an object.
Constraint 8: We either unlock yellow_door_1 or hold an object.
Constraint 9: We are in room_1 in the initial state.
Constraint 10: After being in room_1, we pick up an object.
Constraint 11: We move purple_box_1 to room_3.
Constraint 12: We hold objects during our plan.
Constraint 13: We unlock yellow_door_2.

Actually, I don't think we need to move green_ball_1 to room_1 according to constraint 1. Constraint 1 requires that at some point, either we're holding an object OR green_ball_1 is in room_1. Since we'll be holding objects during our plan, this constraint will be satisfied.

Ok, actually let's revise the plan to more fully detail all the actions we'll take:

1. In room_1:
   - Pick up grey_box_1
   - Go in front of green_door_1 (but don't toggle it)
   - Go in front of yellow_door_1
   - Toggle yellow_door_1 to unlock it
2. Go to room_2 via yellow_door_1
3. In room_2:
   - Go in front of red_door_1
   - Toggle red_door_1 to unlock it
4. Go to room_4 via red_door_1
5. In room_4:
   - Go in front of purple_box_1
   - Drop grey_box_1 (to free our hands)
   - Pick up purple_box_1
   - Go in front of yellow_door_2
   - Toggle yellow_door_2 to unlock it
6. Go to room_3 via yellow_door_2
7. In room_3:
   - Go in front of an empty position
   - Drop purple_box_1
   - Go in front of grey_box_3 (to fulfill the goal)

Wait, actually the goal requires a grey box to be in room_3, and we to be in front of that grey box. There's already a grey box in room_3, which is grey_box_3. So, all we need to do is to go to room_3 and stand in front of grey_box_3. But we still need to fulfill all the constraints.

Let's revise the plan:

1. In room_1:
   - Pick up grey_box_1
   - Go in front of green_door_1 (but don't toggle it)
   - Go in front of yellow_door_1
   - Toggle yellow_door_1 to unlock it
2. Go to room_2 via yellow_door_1
3. In room_2:
   - Go in front of red_door_1
   - Toggle red_door_1 to unlock it
4. Go to room_4 via red_door_1
5. In room_4:
   - Go in front of purple_box_1
   - Pick up purple_box_1 (after dropping grey_box_1)
   - Go in front of yellow_door_2
   - Toggle yellow_door_2 to unlock it
6. Go to room_3 via yellow_door_2
7. In room_3:
   - Drop purple_box_1
   - Go in front of grey_box_3 (to fulfill the goal)

But there's a problem: the constraints 1 and 8 say at some point we either need to be holding an object OR yellow_door_1 is unlocked. If we drop grey_box_1 in room_4, we won't be holding any object when we're in room_3. Similarly for constraint 1, it states we either need to be holding an object OR green_ball_1 is in room_1. However, there's nothing in the constraints that says we can't be holding an object in room_3. So, let's revise the plan:

Actually, let's carefully go through the plan step by step, ensuring that each action is valid and all constraints are met.

Revised Plan:

1. In room_1:
   - Go in front of grey_box_1
   - Pick up grey_box_1  (Constraints 1, 8, 10, and 12 are satisfied: we are holding an object)
   - Go in front of green_door_1 (Constraint 3 is satisfied: we are in front of green_door_1; Constraint 4 is satisfied: before being in front of green_door_1, we are holding an object)
   - Go in front of yellow_door_1
   - Toggle yellow_door_1 to unlock it (Constraint 5 and 8 are satisfied: yellow_door_1 is not locked)
2. Go to room_2 via yellow_door_1
3. In room_2:
   - Go in front of red_door_1
   - Toggle red_door_1 to unlock it (Constraint 5 is further satisfied: red_door_1 is not locked)
4. Go to room_4 via red_door_1
5. In room_4:
   - Go in front of purple_box_1
   - Go to an empty spot
   - Drop grey_box_1
   - Go in front of purple_box_1
   - Pick up purple_box_1 (Constraint 12 is still satisfied: we are holding some object)
   - Go in front of yellow_door_2
   - Toggle yellow_door_2 to unlock it (Constraint 13 is satisfied: yellow_door_2 is not locked)
6. Go to room_3 via yellow_door_2
7. In room_3:
   - Go to an empty spot
   - Drop purple_box_1 (Constraint 11 is satisfied: purple_box_1 is in room_3)
   - Go in front of grey_box_3 (Constraint 6 is satisfied: we are in front of grey_box_3; Constraint 7 is satisfied: before being in front of grey_box_3, we were holding an object; Goal is satisfied: grey_box_3 is a grey box in room_3, we are in room_3, and we are in front of grey_box_3)

But actually, let's go through all the constraints again to make sure we've satisfied them:

1. "Either holding an object or green_ball_1 is in room_1" must be true at some point.
   - We're holding grey_box_1 at some point, so this is satisfied.

2. "green_door_1 is locked" must always be true.
   - We never unlock green_door_1, so this is satisfied.

3. "You are in front of green_door_1" must be true at some point.
   - We go in front of green_door_1, so this is satisfied.

4. Before being in front of green_door_1, you must be holding an object.
   - We pick up grey_box_1 before going in front of green_door_1, so this is satisfied.

5. Either yellow_door_1 or red_door_1 must be unlocked at some point.
   - We unlock both, so this is satisfied.

6. "You are in front of grey_box_3" must be true at some point.
   - We go in front of grey_box_3, so this is satisfied.

7. Before being in front of grey_box_3, either grey_box_1 is in room_2 or you are holding some object.
   - We are holding objects (grey_box_1 and then purple_box_1) before going in front of grey_box_3, so this is satisfied.

8. Either yellow_door_1 is unlocked or you are holding some object at some point.
   - We both unlock yellow_door_1 and hold objects, so this is satisfied.

9. "You are in room_1" must be true at some point.
   - We start in room_1, so this is satisfied.

10. After being in room_1, you must hold an object at some point.
    - We pick up grey_box_1 in room_1, so this is satisfied.

11. "purple_box_1 is in room_3" must be true at some point.
    - We bring purple_box_1 to room_3 and drop it there, so this is satisfied.

12. "You are holding some object" must be true at some point.
    - We hold grey_box_1 and purple_box_1 at different points, so this is satisfied.

13. "yellow_door_2 is not locked" must be true at some point.
    - We unlock yellow_door_2, so this is satisfied.

All constraints are satisfied.

Now, let's make sure the sequence of actions is valid, considering the preconditions of each action:

1. "gotoobject grey_box_1 room_1" - We're in room_1 with grey_box_1, so this is valid.
2. "pick grey_box_1 room_1" - We're in front of grey_box_1 and not holding any object, so this is valid.
3. "gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3" - We're in room_1 and green_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3, so this is valid.
4. "gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2" - We're in room_1 and yellow_door_1 connects room_1 and room_2, so this is valid.
5. "toggle yellow_door_1" - We're in front of yellow_door_1, so this is valid.
6. "gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1" - We're in room_1, yellow_door_1 connects room_1 and room_2, and yellow_door_1 is unlocked, so this is valid.
7. "gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_4" - We're in room_2 and red_door_1 connects room_2 and room_4, so this is valid.
8. "toggle red_door_1" - We're in front of red_door_1, so this is valid.
9. "gotoroom room_2 room_4 red_door_1" - We're in room_2, red_door_1 connects room_2 and room_4, and red_door_1 is unlocked, so this is valid.
10. "gotoobject purple_box_1 room_4" - We're in room_4 with purple_box_1, so this is valid.
11. "gotoempty" - We can go to an empty position anytime, so this is valid.
12. "drop grey_box_1 room_4" - We're holding grey_box_1 and in front of an empty position, so this is valid.
13. "gotoobject purple_box_1 room_4" - We're in room_4 with purple_box_1, so this is valid.
14. "pick purple_box_1 room_4" - We're in front of purple_box_1 and not holding any object, so this is valid.
15. "gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_3" - We're in room_4 and yellow_door_2 connects room_4 and room_3, so this is valid.
16. "toggle yellow_door_2" - We're in front of yellow_door_2, so this is valid.
17. "gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_2" - We're in room_4, yellow_door_2 connects room_4 and room_3, and yellow_door_2 is unlocked, so this is valid.
18. "gotoempty" - We can go to an empty position anytime, so this is valid.
19. "drop purple_box_1 room_3" - We're holding purple_box_1 and in front of an empty position, so this is valid.
20. "gotoobject grey_box_3 room_3" - We're in room_3 with grey_box_3, so this is valid.

All actions are valid.

Let's finalize the plan:

```
gotoobject grey_box_1 room_1
pick grey_box_1 room_1
gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2
toggle yellow_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1
gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_4
toggle red_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_4 red_door_1
gotoobject purple_box_1 room_4
gotoempty
drop grey_box_1 room_4
gotoobject purple_box_1 room_4
pick purple_box_1 room_4
gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_3
toggle yellow_door_2
gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_2
gotoempty
drop purple_box_1 room_3
gotoobject grey_box_3 room_3
```

I'm pretty sure this plan is optimal, as it doesn't contain any redundant actions.

Actually, wait, let me check once more that all the constraints are satisfied.

Constraints:
1. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 
   "At least one of the following conditions is true: "you are holding some object", "green_ball_1 is in room_1"""
   - We hold grey_box_1 and then purple_box_1, so this constraint is satisfied.

2. "The following expression must hold in every state: 
   "green_door_1 is locked""
   - We never toggle green_door_1, so it remains locked throughout, and this constraint is satisfied.

3. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 
   "you are in front of green_door_1""
   - After picking up grey_box_1, we go in front of green_door_1, so this constraint is satisfied.

4. "If expression 
   "you are in front of green_door_1"
   holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: 
   "you are holding some object""
   - We pick up grey_box_1 before going in front of green_door_1, so this constraint is satisfied.

5. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 
   "At least one of the following conditions is true: "yellow_door_1 is not locked", "red_door_1 is not locked"""
   - We unlock both yellow_door_1 and red_door_1, so this constraint is satisfied.

6. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 
   "you are in front of grey_box_3""
   - Our last action is to go in front of grey_box_3, so this constraint is satisfied.

7. "If expression 
   "you are in front of grey_box_3"
   holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: 
   "At least one of the following conditions is true: "grey_box_1 is in room_2", "you are holding some object"""
   - We hold grey_box_1 and then purple_box_1 before going in front of grey_box_3, so this constraint is satisfied.

8. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 
   "At least one of the following conditions is true: "yellow_door_1 is not locked", "you are holding some object"""
   - We both unlock yellow_door_1 and hold objects, so this constraint is satisfied.

9. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 
   "you are in room_1""
   - We start in room_1, so this constraint is satisfied.

10. "If expression 
    "you are in room_1"
    holds in some state s, then expression
    "you are holding some object"
    must hold at s or at some state after s"
    - We pick up grey_box_1 in room_1, so this constraint is satisfied.

11. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 
    "purple_box_1 is in room_3""
    - We bring purple_box_1 to room_3 and drop it there, so this constraint is satisfied.

12. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 
    "you are holding some object""
    - We hold grey_box_1 and then purple_box_1, so this constraint is satisfied.

13. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 
    "yellow_door_2 is not locked""
    - We unlock yellow_door_2, so this constraint is satisfied.

All constraints are satisfied.

Actually, let's check once more the plan to ensure all actions are valid:

1. "gotoobject grey_box_1 room_1" - We're in room_1 with grey_box_1, so this is valid.
2. "pick grey_box_1 room_1" - We're in front of grey_box_1 and not holding any object, so this is valid.
3. "gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3" - We're in room_1 and green_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3, so this is valid.
4. "gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2" - We're in room_1 and yellow_door_1 connects room_1 and room_2, so this is valid.
5. "toggle yellow_door_1" - We're in front of yellow_door_1, so this is valid.
6. "gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1" - We're in room_1, yellow_door_1 connects room_1 and room_2, and yellow_door_1 is unlocked, so this is valid.
7. "gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_4" - We're in room_2 and red_door_1 connects room_2 and room_4, so this is valid.
8. "toggle red_door_1" - We're in front of red_door_1, so this is valid.
9. "gotoroom room_2 room_4 red_door_1" - We're in room_2, red_door_1 connects room_2 and room_4, and red_door_1 is unlocked, so this is valid.
10. "gotoobject purple_box_1 room_4" - We're in room_4 with purple_box_1, so this is valid.
11. "gotoempty" - We can go to an empty position anytime, so this is valid.
12. "drop grey_box_1 room_4" - We're holding grey_box_1 and in front of an empty position, so this is valid.
13. "gotoobject purple_box_1 room_4" - We're in room_4 with purple_box_1, so this is valid.
14. "pick purple_box_1 room_4" - We're in front of purple_box_1 and not holding any object, so this is valid.
15. "gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_3" - We're in room_4 and yellow_door_2 connects room_4 and room_3, so this is valid.
16. "toggle yellow_door_2" - We're in front of yellow_door_2, so this is valid.
17. "gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_2" - We're in room_4, yellow_door_2 connects room_4 and room_3, and yellow_door_2 is unlocked, so this is valid.
18. "gotoempty" - We can go to an empty position anytime, so this is valid.
19. "drop purple_box_1 room_3" - We're holding purple_box_1 and in front of an empty position, so this is valid.
20. "gotoobject grey_box_3 room_3" - We're in room_3 with grey_box_3, so this is valid.

All actions are valid.

Now, let's think about the most optimal plan. Is there a shorter path to reach our goal? Let me think through different options:

We need to go to room_3 and be in front of grey_box_3. There are a few routes we could take:
1. room_1 -> room_3 directly via green_door_1
2. room_1 -> room_2 -> room_4 -> room_3

But we have several constraints. For one, constraint 11 says that at some point, purple_box_1 must be in room_3. So we definitely need to visit room_4 to pick up purple_box_1 and then bring it to room_3. Given this, it would be most efficient to use the second route.

Additionally, constraint 2 says green_door_1 must always remain locked, so we can't even use the first route.

Let's check if there are any steps in our current plan that can be optimized or removed:

- We need to go in front of green_door_1 due to constraint 3, but we don't need to unlock it due to constraint 2.
- We need to unlock yellow_door_1 to satisfy constraint 5 and to move to room_2.
- We need to unlock red_door_1 to satisfy constraint 5 and to move to room_4.
- We need to pick up grey_box_1 to satisfy constraints 1, 4, 7, 8, 10, and 12.
- We need to drop grey_box_1 to pick up purple_box_1 (since we can't hold two objects at once).
- We need to pick up purple_box_1 to move it to room_3 to satisfy constraint 11.
- We need to unlock yellow_door_2 to satisfy constraint 13 and to move to room_3.
- We need to drop purple_box_1 in room_3 to satisfy constraint 11 and free our hands.
- We need to go in front of grey_box_3 to satisfy constraint 6 and to fulfill the goal.

So, all steps in our current plan seem necessary.

Let me check if the order of these steps can be optimized. We might be able to satisfy constraint 7 more efficiently if we move grey_box_1 to room_2 before going in front of grey_box_3, rather than holding an object. But that would likely require more steps because we'd need to drop grey_box_1 in room_2, and later, we'd still need to pick up purple_box_1 and bring it to room_3.

I think the order in the current plan is optimal.

Let's finalize the optimal plan:

```
gotoobject grey_box_1 room_1
pick grey_box_1 room_1
gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2
toggle yellow_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1
gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_4
toggle red_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_4 red_door_1
gotoobject purple_box_1 room_4
gotoempty
drop grey_box_1 room_4
gotoobject purple_box_1 room_4
pick purple_box_1 room_4
gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_3
toggle yellow_door_2
gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_2
gotoempty
drop purple_box_1 room_3
gotoobject grey_box_3 room_3
```

I'm confident this is the optimal plan to satisfy all constraints and achieve the goal. It has 20 steps, and I don't see a way to further reduce the number of steps while still satisfying all the constraints and achieving the goal.

Actually, wait. The goal is "There is a box v such that 'The following conditions are all true: "v is grey", "v is in room_3", "you are in room_3", "you are in front of v'". Can we achieve this goal by moving grey_box_1 to room_3 and standing in front of it, rather than standing in front of grey_box_3?

The goal would be satisfied if:
- grey_box_1 is in room_3
- We're in room_3
- We're in front of grey_box_1

But we can't use the direct path from room_1 to room_3 because green_door_1 must remain locked. So, we'd need to go through room_2 and room_4 to get to room_3.

Let's sketch an alternative plan:
1. Pick up grey_box_1 in room_1.
2. Go in front of green_door_1 (but don't toggle it).
3. Go in front of yellow_door_1 and unlock it.
4. Go to room_2.
5. Go in front of red_door_1 and unlock it.
6. Go to room_4.
7. Go in front of yellow_door_2 and unlock it.
8. Go to room_3.
9. Go to an empty position.
10. Drop grey_box_1 in room_3.
11. Go in front of grey_box_1 to satisfy the goal.

This plan would satisfy most of the constraints, but it doesn't address constraint 11, which requires purple_box_1 to be in room_3 at some point.

So, it would still be necessary to drop grey_box_1, pick up purple_box_1, bring it to room_3, and then pick up grey_box_1 again. This would involve more steps than our current plan.

I think our current plan is optimal.

Actually, it just occurred to me that our goal is to have a grey box in room_3 and be in front of it. We already have grey_box_3 in room_3 at the start of the problem, so the path to the goal could be simpler than we've been considering.

Let's check all the constraints once more:

Constraints:
1. "Either holding an object or green_ball_1 is in room_1" must be true at some point.
2. "green_door_1 is locked" must always be true.
3. "You are in front of green_door_1" must be true at some point.
4. Before being in front of green_door_1, you must be holding an object.
5. Either yellow_door_1 or red_door_1 must be unlocked at some point.
6. "You are in front of grey_box_3" must be true at some point.
7. Before being in front of grey_box_3, either grey_box_1 is in room_2 or you are holding some object.
8. Either yellow_door_1 is unlocked or you are holding some object at some point.
9. "You are in room_1" must be true at some point.
10. After being in room_1, you must hold an object at some point.
11. "purple_box_1 is in room_3" must be true at some point.
12. "You are holding some object" must be true at some point.
13. "yellow_door_2 is not locked" must be true at some point.

There do seem to be a lot of constraints that require us to pick up and move objects. I think our current plan is already good.

Let's once more check all the steps of our current plan to ensure we didn't miss any efficiency improvements:

1. "gotoobject grey_box_1 room_1"
2. "pick grey_box_1 room_1"
3. "gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3"
4. "gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2"
5. "toggle yellow_door_1"
6. "gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1"
7. "gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_4"
8. "toggle red_door_1"
9. "gotoroom room_2 room_4 red_door_1"
10. "gotoobject purple_box_1 room_4"
11. "gotoempty"
12. "drop grey_box_1 room_4"
13. "gotoobject purple_box_1 room_4"
14. "pick purple_box_1 room_4"
15. "gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_3"
16. "toggle yellow_door_2"
17. "gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_2"
18. "gotoempty"
19. "drop purple_box_1 room_3"
20. "gotoobject grey_box_3 room_3"

Each step seems necessary given the constraints we have.

Alright, the plan is:

```
gotoobject grey_box_1 room_1
pick grey_box_1 room_1
gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2
toggle yellow_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1
gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_4
toggle red_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_4 red_door_1
gotoobject purple_box_1 room_4
gotoempty
drop grey_box_1 room_4
gotoobject purple_box_1 room_4
pick purple_box_1 room_4
gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_3
toggle yellow_door_2
gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_2
gotoempty
drop purple_box_1 room_3
gotoobject grey_box_3 room_3
```

I'm confident this is the optimal plan to satisfy all constraints and achieve the goal. It has 20 steps, and I don't see a way to further reduce the number of steps while still satisfying all the constraints and achieving the goal.
