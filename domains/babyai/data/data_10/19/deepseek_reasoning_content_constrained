Okay, let's tackle this planning problem step by step. The goal is to get a grey box (v) into room_3, be in room_3, and be in front of it. The constraints are quite a lot, so I need to make sure each one is satisfied.

First, let's list out the initial state. The agent starts in room_1. The doors are all locked initially: yellow_door_1 (connecting room_1 and room_2), green_door_1 (connecting room_1 and room_3), red_door_1 (room_2 and room_4), and yellow_door_2 (room_3 and room_4). The boxes and balls are in their respective rooms. The green_ball_1 is in room_2, and the grey_box_3 (which is grey) is already in room_3. Wait, the goal is to have a grey box in room_3. So maybe grey_box_3 is already there. But the goal also requires the agent to be in room_3 and in front of that box. So maybe the solution involves moving to room_3 and being in front of grey_box_3. But wait, the initial state has grey_box_3 in room_3. So perhaps the main task is to get to room_3 and position in front of it. But how?

But there are constraints. Let's go through them one by one.

Constraints:
1. At least one state must have the agent holding an object or green_ball_1 in room_1.
2. green_door_1 must always be locked.
3. At least once, the agent is in front of green_door_1.
4. If the agent is in front of green_door_1, they must have held an object before.
5. At least once, either yellow_door_1 or red_door_1 is unlocked.
6. At least once, the agent is in front of grey_box_3.
7. If the agent is in front of grey_box_3, then earlier they must have had grey_box_1 in room_2 or be holding something.
8. At least once, either yellow_door_1 is unlocked or the agent is holding an object.
9. At least once, the agent is in room_1.
10. If in room_1, then in that state or a subsequent state, the agent is holding an object.
11. At least once, purple_box_1 is in room_3.
12. At least once, the agent is holding an object.
13. At least once, yellow_door_2 is unlocked.

Hmm. Let's start by thinking about how to reach room_3. The agent starts in room_1. The doors to room_2 (yellow_door_1) and room_3 (green_door_1) are both locked. To unlock a door, the agent needs to toggle it, which requires being in front of it. But to get to the door, they need to go to it. However, the green_door_1 is in room_1, connecting to room_3. Wait, the agent is in room_1, so can they go to green_door_1? The preconditions for "gotodoor d r1 r2" are that they are in a room connected by d, and there's no object blocking the position in front of d. Are there any objects blocking doors? The initial state doesn't mention any objects blocking doors, so perhaps they can go to the door.

But the problem is that all doors are locked. Wait, no: the "toggle" action can unlock a door if it's locked. So the agent can go to green_door_1 (which connects room_1 and room_3), but since green_door_1 is locked, they can't go through it unless they unlock it. However, constraint 2 says that green_door_1 must always be locked. So toggling it would unlock it, but then we have to make sure it's locked again? Because the constraint is that in every state, green_door_1 is locked. So if the agent toggles it, that would unlock it, violating the constraint. Therefore, the agent cannot toggle green_door_1 at all. Therefore, they can never unlock green_door_1, so they can't use it to go to room_3. So the only way to get to room_3 is through room_4? Let's see the connections.

Rooms are connected as follows:
- room_1 connected to room_2 via yellow_door_1 (locked)
- room_1 connected to room_3 via green_door_1 (locked, must stay locked)
- room_2 connected to room_4 via red_door_1 (locked)
- room_3 connected to room_4 via yellow_door_2 (locked)

So all doors are initially locked. To unlock a door, the agent needs to toggle it, but for that, they need to be in front of it. However, they can only go to a door if they are in the room connected by that door. So, for example, to get to yellow_door_1 (connecting room_1 and room_2), the agent is in room_1. So they can go to yellow_door_1 in room_1. Then toggle it to unlock. But constraint 2 requires green_door_1 to remain locked always. So the agent can't toggle that one. But other doors can be toggled as needed, as long as the constraints that require certain doors to be unlocked at some point are met.

Wait, but the agent starts in room_1. The doors in room_1 are yellow_door_1 (to room_2) and green_door_1 (to room_3). Since green_door_1 must remain locked, the agent can't use that door. So the only way out of room_1 is via yellow_door_1. But it's locked. So the agent needs to unlock it. Let's see: to unlock yellow_door_1, the agent must go in front of it and toggle it. Then they can go through.

But let's check the constraints. Constraint 5 requires that at least once, either yellow_door_1 or red_door_1 is unlocked. So if we unlock yellow_door_1, that satisfies this. Also, constraint 8 requires that at least once, either yellow_door_1 is unlocked or the agent is holding an object. So unlocking yellow_door_1 would satisfy that. Also, constraint 13 requires that yellow_door_2 is unlocked at least once. So we need to plan to unlock that as well.

So the plan might involve unlocking yellow_door_1, moving to room_2, then perhaps unlocking red_door_1 to get to room_4, then from room_4 to room_3 via yellow_door_2, which also needs to be unlocked. But wait, the goal is to be in room_3. So perhaps the path is room_1 -> room_2 via yellow_door_1 (unlock it), then room_2 -> room_4 via red_door_1 (unlock it), then room_4 -> room_3 via yellow_door_2 (unlock it). But then, once in room_3, the agent can go to grey_box_3 and be in front of it.

But also, the constraints require:

- The agent must be in room_1 at least once. Since they start there, that's satisfied, but if they leave, they need to come back? Wait, constraint 9 says at least once, the agent is in room_1. Since they start there, that's already true. But constraint 10 says that if the agent is in room_1 in some state, then in that state or a subsequent one, they must hold an object. So since the initial state is in room_1, the agent must hold an object either in the initial state (which they aren't) or in some subsequent state after being in room_1. So when the agent is in room_1, they need to pick up an object before leaving or at some point after being in room_1. But they start in room_1. So their first actions could be to pick up an object in room_1. But in room_1, there's grey_box_1 and red_box_1. So maybe pick up one of them.

But let's think: the agent is in room_1. To unlock yellow_door_1, they need to go to it and toggle it. But before that, can they pick up an object? Let's see. The steps could be:

1. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_1
2. pick grey_box_1 room_1
3. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2
4. toggle yellow_door_1 (unlocks it)
5. gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1
6. Now in room_2. Then proceed to room_4 via red_door_1 (unlock it), then to room_4, then to room_3 via yellow_door_2 (unlock it), then go to grey_box_3.

But let's check the constraints:

- Constraint 1: At least one state where holding an object or green_ball_1 in room_1. Since we pick up grey_box_1 in room_1, that satisfies the holding part. So that's covered.

- Constraint 3: Must be in front of green_door_1 at least once. But how? The agent is in room_1. They can go to green_door_1. But since green_door_1 is locked and must stay locked, perhaps they need to go to it, but can't go through. So maybe after picking up the box, they go to green_door_1 to satisfy being in front of it. But constraint 4 says that if they are in front of green_door_1, they must have held an object before. So if they pick up the box first, then go to green_door_1, that would satisfy it.

So steps after picking up the box:

3. gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3 (to be in front of green_door_1)
4. Then go to yellow_door_1 and unlock it.

But wait, this adds steps. Let's outline:

1. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_1
2. pick grey_box_1 room_1 (now holding, satisfies constraints 12, 1)
3. gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3 (agent is in front of green_door_1, which satisfies constraint 3)
4. Now, need to unlock yellow_door_1. So gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2
5. toggle yellow_door_1 (unlocks it, satisfies constraint 5 and 8)
6. gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1 (now in room_2)
7. drop grey_box_1 room_2 (so that we can pick up another object if needed, but maybe not necessary)
Wait, but why drop it? Maybe we need to carry it further. Alternatively, perhaps after toggling yellow_door_1, go to room_2, then unlock red_door_1, which is in room_2 connecting to room_4. So steps:

7. gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_4
8. toggle red_door_1 (unlocks it, which also helps with constraint 5)
9. gotoroom room_2 room_4 red_door_1 (now in room_4)
10. Now, need to get to room_3. From room_4, the door to room_3 is yellow_door_2. So gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_3
11. toggle yellow_door_2 (unlocks it, satisfying constraint 13)
12. gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_2 (now in room_3)
13. Now, in room_3, need to be in front of grey_box_3. So gotoobject grey_box_3 room_3 (satisfies constraint 6)
14. But the goal is to be in room_3, in front of a grey box. Since grey_box_3 is already there, this would achieve the goal.

But let's check the other constraints:

- Constraint 7: If in front of grey_box_3, then earlier either grey_box_1 was in room_2 or holding something. Since the agent was holding grey_box_1 earlier (step 2), this is satisfied.

- Constraint 11: At least once, purple_box_1 is in room_3. But purple_box_1 is initially in room_4. To get it to room_3, the agent would need to pick it up in room_4 and drop it in room_3. However, in the current plan, the agent is in room_4 (step 9) but doesn't pick up purple_box_1. So constraint 11 is not satisfied. Oh, right, this is a problem. So the agent needs to bring purple_box_1 to room_3.

So, after step 9 (in room_4), the agent needs to pick up purple_box_1 and carry it to room_3.

So revising steps:

9. (In room_4) gotoobject purple_box_1 room_4
10. pick purple_box_1 room_4 (now holding it)
11. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_3
12. toggle yellow_door_2 (unlocks)
13. gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_2 (now in room_3)
14. drop purple_box_1 room_3 (now purple_box_1 is in room_3, satisfying constraint 11)
15. gotoobject grey_box_3 room_3 (satisfies constraint 6 and the goal)

But wait, when the agent drops purple_box_1 in room_3, they need to be in front of an empty position. The "drop" action requires that the position in front is empty. So after dropping, the agent is in front of purple_box_1. Then, to go to grey_box_3, they need to gotoobject grey_box_3, which requires being in the same room. But after dropping, they are in room_3. So that's possible.

But let's check the steps again:

In room_4, after step 9 (gotoroom room_2 room_4 red_door_1), the agent is in room_4. Then:

10. gotoobject purple_box_1 room_4
11. pick purple_box_1 room_4 (now holding)
12. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_3
13. toggle yellow_door_2 (unlock)
14. gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_2 (now in room_3)
15. drop purple_box_1 room_3 (drops it here)
16. gotoobject grey_box_3 room_3 (now in front of it)

This satisfies constraint 11 (purple_box_1 in room_3). But also, the agent is holding an object (step 11-15), which covers constraint 12.

But also, during the plan, when the agent is in room_1 (initially), they pick up grey_box_1 (step 2), which satisfies constraint 10 (since after being in room_1, they are holding an object). Also, constraint 9 is satisfied because they start in room_1.

Constraint 4: If they are in front of green_door_1 (step 3), then they must have held an object before. Since step 2 is picking up the box, step 3 comes after, so that's satisfied.

Constraint 8: At least once, yellow_door_1 is unlocked or holding an object. When they unlock yellow_door_1 (step 5), that satisfies it. Also, when holding the box (steps 2-7, 10-14), that also covers it.

Now, let's check all constraints again:

1. Satisfied by holding grey_box_1 in step 2.
2. green_door_1 is always locked. The agent only toggles yellow_door_1, red_door_1, yellow_door_2. So green_door_1 remains locked. Correct.
3. Step 3: gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3. Yes.
4. Step 3 (front of green_door_1) comes after step 2 (holding object). Correct.
5. When yellow_door_1 is unlocked (step 5), that's true.
6. Step 16: in front of grey_box_3. Correct.
7. When in front of grey_box_3 (step 16), earlier step 2 holds the box. Correct.
8. Step 5 (yellow_door_1 unlocked) and steps with holding object. Correct.
9. Initial state is in room_1. Correct.
10. After room_1, in step 2, they are holding an object. Correct.
11. Step 15: purple_box_1 is in room_3. Correct.
12. Steps 2, 11, etc. Correct.
13. Step 13: toggle yellow_door_2, unlocking it. Correct.

So this plan seems to satisfy all constraints. Now, let's check if the sequence is possible.

But there's a problem: after step 3 (gotodoor green_door_1), the agent is in front of green_door_1. Then, to go to yellow_door_1, they need to goto door yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2. But in step 3, after being in front of green_door_1, to get to yellow_door_1, they need to use gotodoor again. The agent is still in room_1. So steps would be:

1. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_1
2. pick grey_box_1 room_1
3. gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3 (now in front of green_door_1)
4. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2 (must be possible if no objects are blocking. Since the initial state doesn't mention objects blocking doors, this is allowed)
5. toggle yellow_door_1 (unlock)
6. gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1 (now in room_2)
7. gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_4 (needs to go to red_door_1 in room_2)
8. toggle red_door_1 (unlock)
9. gotoroom room_2 room_4 red_door_1 (now in room_4)
10. gotoobject purple_box_1 room_4
11. pick purple_box_1 room_4
12. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_3
13. toggle yellow_door_2 (unlock)
14. gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_2 (now in room_3)
15. drop purple_box_1 room_3
16. gotoobject grey_box_3 room_3

This sequence should work. Let's check each action's preconditions:

- Step 1: gotoobject requires being in room_1. Correct.
- Step 2: pick requires being in room_1 and not holding anything. Correct.
- Step 3: gotodoor green_door_1 (connecting room_1 and room_3). Agent is in room_1. Correct.
- Step 4: gotodoor yellow_door_1 (room_1 and room_2). Correct. No blocking objects.
- Step 5: toggle requires being in front of door. Yes, after step 4.
- Step 6: gotoroom from room_1 to room_2 via yellow_door_1, which is now unlocked. Correct.
- Step 7: gotodoor red_door_1 (room_2 to room_4). Agent is in room_2. Correct.
- Step 8: toggle red_door_1 (now unlocked)
- Step 9: gotoroom to room_4 via red_door_1. Correct.
- Step 10: gotoobject purple_box_1 in room_4. Correct.
- Step 11: pick it up. Hands are empty. Correct.
- Step 12: gotodoor yellow_door_2 (room_4 to room_3). Correct.
- Step 13: toggle. Now unlocked.
- Step 14: gotoroom to room_3. Correct.
- Step 15: drop purple_box_1. In front of empty position? After entering room_3, the agent is not in front of anything (effect of gotoroom). So they can drop it. Wait, after gotoroom, the agent is no longer in front of anything. So they need to gotoempty or gotoobject before dropping. Wait, the drop action requires that the position in front is empty. But after entering a room via gotoroom, the agent is not in front of anything. So to drop, they need to be in front of an empty spot. So perhaps after entering room_3 (step 14), they need to gotoempty to be in front of an empty spot, then drop.

Ah, right! The drop action requires that the position in front is empty. So after step 14 (gotoroom room_4 to room_3), the agent is not in front of anything. So they can't drop unless they go to an empty spot. So step 14 is followed by:

14. gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_2
15. gotoempty (in room_3)
16. drop purple_box_1 room_3
17. gotoobject grey_box_3 room_3

So inserting step 15 (gotoempty) before dropping.

But wait, the "gotoempty" action allows the agent to go to an empty position. Then, when they drop, they are in front of that empty spot, which is now occupied by the dropped object. So the sequence would be:

14. gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_2
15. gotoempty (now in front of empty spot)
16. drop purple_box_1 room_3 (now in front of purple_box_1)
17. gotoobject grey_box_3 room_3 (must be in the same room)

So this adds an extra step. But is that necessary? Yes, because after entering room_3, the agent isn't in front of anything. So to drop, they need to be in front of an empty position.

Similarly, after dropping, they need to go to grey_box_3.

So the revised steps:

After step 14 (enter room_3):

15. gotoempty (room_3)
16. drop purple_box_1 room_3
17. gotoobject grey_box_3 room_3

Now, the plan includes this. Let's check if all preconditions are met.

Yes:

- Step 15: gotoempty is always allowed.
- Step 16: drop requires holding the object (yes) and being in front of empty spot (yes, after gotoempty).
- Step 17: gotoobject grey_box_3 in room_3 (agent is in room_3, correct).

Now, all steps are valid.

Now, let's check all constraints again with the updated steps.

Yes, all constraints are satisfied.

Now, let's check the optimality. The plan has 17 steps. Is there a shorter way? For example, can we avoid going to room_4? Let's think. The agent needs to bring purple_box_1 to room_3. But purple_box_1 is in room_4, so they have to go there. Alternatively, maybe there's a way through room_2 and room_4 to get to room_3. But given the doors, it's necessary to go through room_4 to reach room_3 from room_2, since room_2 connects to room_4 via red_door_1, and room_4 connects to room_3 via yellow_door_2. So that's the only path.

Alternatively, could the agent unlock yellow_door_2 from room_3? But to reach room_3, they need to go through room_4. Since green_door_1 is locked and must stay locked. So no. So the path is necessary.

Therefore, the plan is optimal.
