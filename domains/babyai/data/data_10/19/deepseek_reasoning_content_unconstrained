Okay, let's tackle this planning problem step by step. So, the goal is to have a grey box in room_3, with me (the agent) in room_3 and in front of that box. The initial state has me in room_1, and there are several boxes and doors, all of which are locked. Let's break down what needs to happen.

First, I need to get to room_3. The initial position is room_1. Looking at the doors, room_1 is connected to room_3 via green_door_1, which is locked. So I need to unlock that door. But to toggle a door, I have to be in front of it. So the first step is to go to green_door_1 in room_1. However, the preconditions for gotodoor are that there's no object blocking the position in front of the door. Wait, in room_1, there's grey_box_1 and red_box_1. Are they blocking any doors? The problem states that objects can block doors. But in the initial state, there's no mention of objects blocking doors. Wait, but the effect of the "drop" action says that if the object was blocking a door, it's no longer blocking. But initially, are any objects blocking doors? The original state doesn't mention any blocking, so maybe the doors are not blocked by objects. So I can go to the door.

So, first action: gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3. Then toggle it to unlock. Then go through the door to room_3. Once in room_3, there's yellow_box_2 and grey_box_3. The goal requires a grey box in room_3. grey_box_3 is already in room_3 and is grey. So maybe that's the box we need. So the goal is to be in room_3 in front of a grey box. Since grey_box_3 is already there, perhaps I just need to go to it. But how do I get there?

Wait, the initial state says I'm in room_1. So steps would be:

1. Go to green_door_1 in room_1.
2. Toggle green_door_1 to unlock it.
3. Use gotoroom to move from room_1 to room_3 via green_door_1.
4. Once in room_3, go to grey_box_3.
5. Then, check if that satisfies the goal: grey_box_3 is in room_3, I'm in room_3, and in front of it.

But let's check the initial positions. The boxes in room_3 are yellow_box_2 and grey_box_3. So yes, grey_box_3 is already in room_3. So the plan would be:

- Navigate from room_1 to room_3 via green_door_1, unlock the door first, then go through. Then gotoobject grey_box_3 room_3.

But wait, the doors are initially locked. So the green_door_1 is locked. So steps:

1. In room_1: gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3. This is allowed if I'm in a room connected by the door and no object is blocking. Since the initial state doesn't mention any blocking, this should be possible.

2. toggle green_door_1. Now it's unlocked.

3. gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1. This moves me to room_3.

4. Now in room_3. Then gotoobject grey_box_3 room_3.

That's four actions. But let's check the preconditions for each step.

First, "gotodoor d r1 r2": I must be in a room connected by d. Since I'm in room_1, and green_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3, yes. And no object blocking. So that's okay.

Then toggle: must be in front of the door. After gotodoor, I'm in front of green_door_1. So toggle is allowed.

Then gotoroom: since the door is now unlocked, moving to room_3 is possible.

Then, in room_3, gotoobject grey_box_3 room_3. Since I'm in room_3, and grey_box_3 is there, that's allowed.

So the plan would be:

```
gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3
toggle green_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1
gotoobject grey_box_3 room_3
```

But wait, after moving to room_3, when I use gotoobject, I need to be in the same room as the object, which I am. So this should work.

But let me check if there are any constraints I missed. The problem mentions constraints, but the user didn't list any specific ones here. Wait, the original problem says "A valid plan for the abovementioned problem must abide by the following constraints:" but then there's nothing listed. Maybe a formatting error. But assuming there are no additional constraints beyond the action preconditions.

So this plan seems valid. Let's count the steps: 4 actions. Is there a shorter way? For example, is there a way to unlock the door without having to go to it first? No, because toggle requires being in front of the door. So steps 1 and 2 are necessary. Then moving to room_3, then going to the box. So 4 steps. Is there a possibility that the grey_box_3 is not in room_3? No, initial state says grey_box_3 is in room_3. So this should be the optimal plan.
