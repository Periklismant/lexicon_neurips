Let me carefully analyze this problem:

1. We start in room_4.
2. We need to end up in front of the grey door (grey_door_1) which connects room_3 and room_4, with the door being unlocked.

There are several constraints to satisfy:

1. Grey door must be unlocked at some point.
2. Before grey door is unlocked, we must hold some object.
3. Grey door must be locked at some point.
4. After grey door is locked, we must be in front of green_ball_1 or purple_ball_1.
5. At some point, we must hold purple_ball_1 or some other object.
6. At some point, we must hold some object.
7. At some point, we must be in room_3.
8. At some point, we must be in room_3 or yellow_door_1 must be unlocked.
9. At some point, we must be in front of green_door_1 and yellow_door_1 must be unlocked.
10. At some point, we must be in front of purple_ball_1.
11. At some point, we must be in room_3 holding purple_box_1.
12. At some point, we must be in front of grey_door_1.
13. Before we are in front of grey_door_1, purple_box_1 must be in room_1.

Given these constraints, let me plan a sequence of actions:

First, let's think about how to navigate between rooms:
- We start in room_4
- To reach room_3, we need to unlock and use grey_door_1
- To reach room_2, we need to unlock and use yellow_door_1
- To reach room_1, we need to unlock and use purple_door_1 from room_2 or green_door_1 from room_3

One constraint is that purple_box_1 must be in room_1 before we are in front of grey_door_1. Currently, purple_box_1 is in room_3, so we need to move it to room_1. This means we need to:
1. Get to room_3
2. Pick up purple_box_1
3. Move to room_1
4. Drop purple_box_1

But to get to room_3, we need to first unlock grey_door_1, and before unlocking it, we need to hold some object.

Let's try to work backward from our goal:
- We need to be in front of grey_door_1 with it unlocked
- Before we're in front of grey_door_1, purple_box_1 must be in room_1
- To unlock grey_door_1, we must be holding an object

Starting from room_4, we can:
1. Pick up green_ball_1 or purple_box_2 (to satisfy the constraint of holding an object)
2. Go to grey_door_1
3. Toggle grey_door_1 to unlock it
4. Go to room_3
5. Pick up purple_box_1
6. Go to green_door_1
7. Toggle green_door_1
8. Go to room_1
9. Drop purple_box_1 (now purple_box_1 is in room_1)
10. Go back to room_3
11. Go to grey_door_1
12. (If grey_door_1 is locked, toggle it again)
13. We're now in front of grey_door_1 and it's unlocked

But we also need to ensure other constraints are met:
- At some point we must be in front of purple_ball_1 (which is in room_3)
- At some point we must be in front of green_door_1 with yellow_door_1 unlocked

Let me revise the plan:

1. Pick up green_ball_1 from room_4
2. Go to grey_door_1
3. Toggle grey_door_1 to unlock it
4. Go to room_3
5. Go to purple_ball_1 (satisfying constraint #10)
6. Go to purple_box_1
7. Drop green_ball_1
8. Pick up purple_box_1 (satisfying constraint #11 since we're in room_3 holding purple_box_1)
9. Go to green_door_1
10. Toggle green_door_1 to unlock it
11. Go to room_1
12. Drop purple_box_1 (now purple_box_1 is in room_1, satisfying constraint #13)
13. Go to green_door_1
14. Toggle green_door_1 (to lock it again if needed)
15. Go to room_3
16. Go to yellow_door_1 (it's not in room_3, so this step needs revision)

Hmm, I realize I've made a mistake. Yellow_door_1 connects room_2 and room_4, not room_3. Let me rethink this.

From the initial state, we know all doors are locked. Here's a corrected plan:

1. In room_4, pick up green_ball_1
2. Go to yellow_door_1
3. Toggle yellow_door_1 to unlock it
4. Go to room_2
5. Go to purple_door_1
6. Toggle purple_door_1 to unlock it
7. Go to room_1
8. Drop green_ball_1
9. Go to green_door_1
10. Toggle green_door_1 to unlock it
11. Go to room_3
12. Go to purple_ball_1 (satisfying constraint #10)
13. Go to purple_box_1
14. Pick up purple_box_1 (satisfying constraint #11 since we're in room_3 holding purple_box_1)
15. Go to green_door_1
16. Toggle green_door_1 (to lock it if it's unlocked)
17. Go to room_1
18. Drop purple_box_1 (now purple_box_1 is in room_1, satisfying constraint #13)
19. Go to green_door_1
20. Toggle green_door_1 (to unlock it if it's locked)
21. Go to room_3
22. Go to grey_door_1
23. Toggle grey_door_1 (to unlock it if it's locked or lock it if it's unlocked)
24. Drop the object I'm holding (wait, I'm not holding anything at this point)

I'm noticing some issues with the plan. Let me re-read the constraints more carefully:

1. Grey door must be unlocked at some point.
2. Before grey door is unlocked, we must hold some object.
3. Grey door must be locked at some point.
4. After grey door is locked, we must be in front of green_ball_1 or purple_ball_1.
5. At some point, we must hold purple_ball_1 or some other object.
6. At some point, we must hold some object.
7. At some point, we must be in room_3.
8. At some point, we must be in room_3 or yellow_door_1 must be unlocked.
9. At some point, we must be in front of green_door_1 and yellow_door_1 must be unlocked.
10. At some point, we must be in front of purple_ball_1.
11. At some point, we must be in room_3 holding purple_box_1.
12. At some point, we must be in front of grey_door_1.
13. Before we are in front of grey_door_1, purple_box_1 must be in room_1.

The goal is to be in front of grey_door_1, which is unlocked, connecting room_3 and room_4.

So, we need to:
- Make sure grey_door_1 is unlocked at the end
- Before unlocking grey_door_1, we need to hold an object
- At some point, grey_door_1 must be locked
- After locking grey_door_1, we need to be in front of green_ball_1 or purple_ball_1
- We need to move purple_box_1 from room_3 to room_1 before we go in front of grey_door_1
- We need to be in room_3 holding purple_box_1 at some point

Let me try again to construct a plan:

1. Pick up green_ball_1 (which is in room_4)
2. Go to grey_door_1
3. Toggle grey_door_1 (unlocking it, satisfying constraint #1 and #2)
4. Go to room_3
5. Go to purple_ball_1 (satisfying constraint #10)
6. Go to purple_box_1
7. Drop green_ball_1
8. Pick up purple_box_1 (satisfying constraint #11)
9. Go to green_door_1
10. Toggle green_door_1 (unlocking it)
11. Go to room_1
12. Drop purple_box_1 (satisfying constraint #13)
13. Go to green_door_1
14. Toggle green_door_1 (locking it)
15. Go to room_3
16. Go to grey_door_1
17. Toggle grey_door_1 (locking it, satisfying constraint #3)
18. Go to purple_ball_1 (satisfying constraint #4)
19. Pick up purple_ball_1 (satisfying constraint #5)
20. Go to grey_door_1
21. Toggle grey_door_1 (unlocking it again)
22. We are now in front of grey_door_1, which is unlocked, satisfying the goal

But there's still a constraint I'm missing. Let's check constraint #9: "At some point, we must be in front of green_door_1 and yellow_door_1 must be unlocked."

Green_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3, and yellow_door_1 connects room_2 and room_4. So I need to unlock yellow_door_1 at some point and then be in front of green_door_1.

Let me modify my plan:

1. Pick up green_ball_1 (which is in room_4)
2. Go to yellow_door_1
3. Toggle yellow_door_1 (unlocking it)
4. Go to grey_door_1
5. Toggle grey_door_1 (unlocking it, satisfying constraint #1 and #2)
6. Go to room_3
7. Go to purple_ball_1 (satisfying constraint #10)
8. Go to purple_box_1
9. Drop green_ball_1
10. Pick up purple_box_1 (satisfying constraint #11)
11. Go to green_door_1
12. Toggle green_door_1 (unlocking it)
13. (At this point, yellow_door_1 is unlocked and we're in front of green_door_1, satisfying constraint #9)
14. Go to room_1
15. Drop purple_box_1 (satisfying constraint #13)
16. Go to green_door_1
17. Toggle green_door_1 (locking it)
18. Go to room_3
19. Go to grey_door_1
20. Toggle grey_door_1 (locking it, satisfying constraint #3)
21. Go to purple_ball_1 (satisfying constraint #4)
22. Pick up purple_ball_1 (satisfying constraint #5)
23. Go to grey_door_1
24. Toggle grey_door_1 (unlocking it again)
25. We are now in front of grey_door_1, which is unlocked, satisfying the goal

Now, let me double-check that all constraints are satisfied:

1. Grey door is unlocked (step 5, then locked in step 20, then unlocked again in step 24)
2. Before grey door is unlocked, we hold green_ball_1 (steps 1-5)
3. Grey door is locked at some point (step 20)
4. After grey door is locked, we are in front of purple_ball_1 (step 21)
5. At some point, we hold purple_ball_1 (step 22)
6. At some point, we hold some object (steps 1, 10, 22)
7. At some point, we are in room_3 (step 6)
8. At some point, we are in room_3 or yellow_door_1 is unlocked (both are true: room_3 in step 6, yellow_door_1 unlocked in step 3)
9. At some point, we are in front of green_door_1 and yellow_door_1 is unlocked (step 13)
10. At some point, we are in front of purple_ball_1 (step 7)
11. At some point, we are in room_3 holding purple_box_1 (step 10)
12. At some point, we are in front of grey_door_1 (steps 4, 19, 23)
13. Before we are in front of grey_door_1 (in steps 19 and 23), purple_box_1 is in room_1 (from step 15)

All constraints seem to be satisfied by this plan.

Let me formalize the actions in the required format:

1. `pick green_ball_1 room_4`
2. `gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_2`
3. `toggle yellow_door_1`
4. `gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3`
5. `toggle grey_door_1`
6. `gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1`
7. `gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_3`
8. `gotoobject purple_box_1 room_3`
9. `drop green_ball_1 room_3`
10. `pick purple_box_1 room_3`
11. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_1`
12. `toggle green_door_1`
13. `gotoroom room_3 room_1 green_door_1`
14. `drop purple_box_1 room_1`
15. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3`
16. `toggle green_door_1`
17. `gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1`
18. `gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4`
19. `toggle grey_door_1`
20. `gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_3`
21. `pick purple_ball_1 room_3`
22. `gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4`
23. `toggle grey_door_1`

This should be the complete plan. Let me check if there are any issues or optimizations:

Actually, I noticed an issue with the ordering of some steps. Let me correct it:

1. `gotoobject green_ball_1 room_4`
2. `pick green_ball_1 room_4`
3. `gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_2`
4. `toggle yellow_door_1`
5. `gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3`
6. `toggle grey_door_1`
7. `gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1`
8. `gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_3`
9. `gotoobject purple_box_1 room_3`
10. `gotoempty`
11. `drop green_ball_1 room_3`
12. `gotoobject purple_box_1 room_3`
13. `pick purple_box_1 room_3`
14. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_1`
15. `toggle green_door_1`
16. `gotoroom room_3 room_1 green_door_1`
17. `gotoempty`
18. `drop purple_box_1 room_1`
19. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3`
20. `toggle green_door_1`
21. `gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1`
22. `gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4`
23. `toggle grey_door_1`
24. `gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_3`
25. `pick purple_ball_1 room_3`
26. `gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4`
27. `toggle grey_door_1`

This plan should satisfy all constraints and achieve the goal. However, I'm noticing some inefficiencies. Let me try to optimize it further:

I'm not convinced that each gotoobject and gotodoor steps are necessary. Let me simplify the plan:

1. `gotoobject green_ball_1 room_4`
2. `pick green_ball_1 room_4`
3. `gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_2`
4. `toggle yellow_door_1`
5. `gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3`
6. `toggle grey_door_1`
7. `gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1`
8. `gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_3`
9. `gotoempty`
10. `drop green_ball_1 room_3`
11. `gotoobject purple_box_1 room_3`
12. `pick purple_box_1 room_3`
13. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_1`
14. `toggle green_door_1`
15. `gotoroom room_3 room_1 green_door_1`
16. `gotoempty`
17. `drop purple_box_1 room_1`
18. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3`
19. `toggle green_door_1`
20. `gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1`
21. `gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4`
22. `toggle grey_door_1`
23. `gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_3`
24. `pick purple_ball_1 room_3`
25. `gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4`
26. `toggle grey_door_1`

I'm still uncertain about steps 9 and 16. Let me review the preconditions for dropping objects: We can only drop an object if (i) we are currently holding it and (ii) the position in front of us is empty.

After step 8, we're in front of purple_ball_1, so we need to move to an empty position before dropping green_ball_1. Thus, step 9 is necessary.

Similarly, after step 15, we've just entered room_1, and we need to move to an empty position before dropping purple_box_1. So step 16 is also necessary.

Overall, I think this plan is optimal and satisfies all the constraints.

Actually, I need to check if we can directly go to the door after picking up the ball. If not, then we should add a gotodoor step after picking up green_ball_1. Let's check the preconditions of gotodoor:

"goto door": You may only go in front of a door d if (i) you are in a room which door d is connecting with another room, and (ii) there is no object blocking the position in front of d in the room you are currently in.

Since we're in room_4 and yellow_door_1 connects room_4 and room_2, we can use gotodoor for yellow_door_1. There's no mention of an object blocking the door, so we can proceed.

Given these considerations, I think the plan is appropriate. Let me review it once more:

1. `gotoobject green_ball_1 room_4` - Go to green_ball_1 in room_4
2. `pick green_ball_1 room_4` - Pick up green_ball_1
3. `gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_2` - Go to yellow_door_1
4. `toggle yellow_door_1` - Unlock yellow_door_1
5. `gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3` - Go to grey_door_1
6. `toggle grey_door_1` - Unlock grey_door_1
7. `gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1` - Go from room_4 to room_3 using grey_door_1
8. `gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_3` - Go to purple_ball_1 in room_3
9. `gotoempty` - Go to an empty position
10. `drop green_ball_1 room_3` - Drop green_ball_1
11. `gotoobject purple_box_1 room_3` - Go to purple_box_1
12. `pick purple_box_1 room_3` - Pick up purple_box_1
13. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_1` - Go to green_door_1
14. `toggle green_door_1` - Unlock green_door_1
15. `gotoroom room_3 room_1 green_door_1` - Go from room_3 to room_1 using green_door_1
16. `gotoempty` - Go to an empty position
17. `drop purple_box_1 room_1` - Drop purple_box_1 in room_1
18. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3` - Go to green_door_1
19. `toggle green_door_1` - Lock green_door_1
20. `gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1` - Wait, this is inconsistent. If I locked green_door_1 in step 19, I can't use it in step 20.

I'm not sure I can lock and then immediately use the same door. Let me reconsider the plan.

Actually, wait. In step 19, I'm toggling green_door_1, which means if it's unlocked (which it is), it becomes locked. Then in step 20, I'm trying to use green_door_1 to go from room_1 to room_3, but I can only do that if the door is unlocked.

So let's adjust the plan:

1. `gotoobject green_ball_1 room_4` - Go to green_ball_1 in room_4
2. `pick green_ball_1 room_4` - Pick up green_ball_1
3. `gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_2` - Go to yellow_door_1
4. `toggle yellow_door_1` - Unlock yellow_door_1
5. `gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3` - Go to grey_door_1
6. `toggle grey_door_1` - Unlock grey_door_1
7. `gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1` - Go from room_4 to room_3 using grey_door_1
8. `gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_3` - Go to purple_ball_1 in room_3
9. `gotoempty` - Go to an empty position
10. `drop green_ball_1 room_3` - Drop green_ball_1
11. `gotoobject purple_box_1 room_3` - Go to purple_box_1
12. `pick purple_box_1 room_3` - Pick up purple_box_1
13. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_1` - Go to green_door_1
14. `toggle green_door_1` - Unlock green_door_1
15. `gotoroom room_3 room_1 green_door_1` - Go from room_3 to room_1 using green_door_1
16. `gotoempty` - Go to an empty position
17. `drop purple_box_1 room_1` - Drop purple_box_1 in room_1
18. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3` - Go to green_door_1
19. `gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1` - Go from room_1 to room_3 using green_door_1
20. `gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4` - Go to grey_door_1
21. `toggle grey_door_1` - Lock grey_door_1
22. `gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_3` - Go to purple_ball_1
23. `pick purple_ball_1 room_3` - Pick up purple_ball_1
24. `gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4` - Go to grey_door_1
25. `toggle grey_door_1` - Unlock grey_door_1

This plan should work, but I'm not satisfying constraint #9: "At some point, we must be in front of green_door_1 and yellow_door_1 must be unlocked."

In my plan, I'm in front of green_door_1 in steps 13 and 18, and yellow_door_1 is unlocked from step 4. But I need to clarify if the constraint means that both conditions must be true simultaneously. If so, then I'm satisfying it.

But if constraint #9 means that yellow_door_1 must be unlocked at the time I'm in front of green_door_1, then I do need to ensure it's still unlocked at that point. Since I don't lock yellow_door_1 in my plan, it should remain unlocked, so this seems to be satisfied.

Another constraint I'm concerned about is #16: "At some point, we must be holding purple_box_1 and be in room_3." In step 12, I pick up purple_box_1 in room_3, so this should be satisfied.

Alright, I think the plan is valid. Let me confirm that the final state achieves the goal: "There is a door d such that 'The following conditions are all true: 'd is grey', 'room_3 and room_4 are connected via d', 'you are in front of d', 'd is not locked'"

In the final state after step 25, I'm in front of grey_door_1, which is grey, connects room_3 and room_4, and is unlocked. So the goal is achieved.

Let me check the entire list of constraints one more time to make sure the plan satisfies them:

1. Grey door is unlocked at some point (steps 6 and 25)
2. Before grey door is unlocked (step 6), I hold green_ball_1 (step 2)
3. Grey door is locked at some point (step 21)
4. After grey door is locked (step 21), I go in front of purple_ball_1 (step 22)
5. At some point, I hold purple_ball_1 (step 23)
6. At some point, I hold some object (steps 2, 12, 23)
7. At some point, I am in room_3 (step 7)
8. At some point, I am in room_3 or yellow_door_1 is unlocked (both true: room_3 in step 7, yellow_door_1 unlocked in step 4)
9. At some point, I am in front of green_door_1 and yellow_door_1 is unlocked (steps 13 and 18 for being in front of green_door_1, and yellow_door_1 is unlocked from step 4)
10. At some point, I am in front of purple_ball_1 (step 8)
11. At some point, I am in room_3 holding purple_box_1 (step 12)
12. At some point, I am in front of grey_door_1 (steps 5, 20, 24)
13. Before I am in front of grey_door_1 (steps 20 and 24), purple_box_1 is in room_1 (from step 17)

All constraints are satisfied by the plan.

Let me finally rewrite the complete plan:

1. `gotoobject green_ball_1 room_4`
2. `pick green_ball_1 room_4`
3. `gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_2`
4. `toggle yellow_door_1`
5. `gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3`
6. `toggle grey_door_1`
7. `gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1`
8. `gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_3`
9. `gotoempty`
10. `drop green_ball_1 room_3`
11. `gotoobject purple_box_1 room_3`
12. `pick purple_box_1 room_3`
13. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_1`
14. `toggle green_door_1`
15. `gotoroom room_3 room_1 green_door_1`
16. `gotoempty`
17. `drop purple_box_1 room_1`
18. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3`
19. `gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1`
20. `gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4`
21. `toggle grey_door_1`
22. `gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_3`
23. `pick purple_ball_1 room_3`
24. `gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4`
25. `toggle grey_door_1`

This is the final plan.
