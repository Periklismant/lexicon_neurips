Alright, I need to solve this planning problem. Let's break down the task first:

Goal: There is a door d such that "The following conditions are all true: "d is grey", "room_3 and room_4 are connected via d", "you are in front of d", "d is not locked""

In other words, I need to:
1. Find a grey door that connects rooms 3 and 4.
2. I need to be in front of this door.
3. The door should be unlocked.

From the initial state, I can identify that the grey door is "grey_door_1", which connects room_3 and room_4. Currently, I'm in room_4, and grey_door_1 is locked.

I need to get to the door and unlock it. Let's plan step by step.

Given I'm in room_4, I can:
1. Go in front of grey_door_1 (using the action "gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3").
2. Use the action "toggle grey_door_1" to unlock it.

With this, I should achieve the goal. Let me write out the plan:

```
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3
toggle grey_door_1
```

Let me double check:
- I'm initially in room_4, so I can go in front of grey_door_1 which connects room_4 and room_3.
- Once I'm in front of the door, I can toggle it to unlock it.
- After these actions, I'll be in room_4, in front of grey_door_1, and grey_door_1 will be unlocked.

This plan should satisfy the goal condition. However, let me check the action preconditions once more:

For the action "gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3":
- I need to be in a room which door grey_door_1 is connecting with another room. This is satisfied as I'm in room_4 and grey_door_1 connects room_4 and room_3.
- There should be no object blocking the position in front of grey_door_1 in room_4. The initial state doesn't mention any objects blocking doors, so I'll assume this is satisfied.

For the action "toggle grey_door_1":
- I need to be in front of grey_door_1. This will be satisfied after the first action.

The plan appears to be correct. Let's check one more time with the action effects:

After "gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3":
- If I was in front of some object or door, I'm no longer in front of it. (Not applicable since the initial state doesn't mention me being in front of anything.)
- I am now in front of grey_door_1.

After "toggle grey_door_1":
- Since grey_door_1 was locked, it becomes unlocked.

After these actions, I'll satisfy all the conditions of the goal:
- grey_door_1 is grey (given in the initial state).
- room_3 and room_4 are connected via grey_door_1 (given in the initial state).
- I am in front of grey_door_1 (after the first action).
- grey_door_1 is not locked (after the second action).

The plan is valid and achieves the goal. The plan is:

```
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3
toggle grey_door_1
```

Actually, let me just double check this. For the action "gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3":
- I need to be in a room which door grey_door_1 is connecting with another room. This is satisfied as I'm in room_4 and grey_door_1 connects room_4 and room_3.
- There should be no object blocking the position in front of grey_door_1 in room_4. The initial state doesn't mention any objects blocking doors, so I'll assume this is satisfied.

But the action "gotodoor" is defined as:
"goto door": you may only go in front of a door d if (i) you are in a room which door d is connecting with another room, and (ii) there is no object blocking the position in front of d in the room you are currently in.

So the syntax of the action should be "gotodoor d r1 r2", where d is the door, r1 is the current room, and r2 is the room the door connects to. In our case, it would be:

"gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3"

Okay, that's what I had. I was mixing up the parameters. Let me check my plan again:

```
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3
toggle grey_door_1
```

This plan should satisfy the goal. Let's finalize:

```
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3
toggle grey_door_1
```

That should be the optimal plan. Grey_door_1 is the grey door connecting room_3 and room_4, I'd be in front of it, and it would be unlocked after these two actions. The plan is just 2 actions, which seems to be the minimal possible length.

Actually, hmm, let's double check that this isn't a trick question, where I am actually required to go to room_3 and then go in front of the door from that side. 

The goal condition says:
"There is a door d such that "The following conditions are all true: "d is grey", "room_3 and room_4 are connected via d", "you are in front of d", "d is not locked"""

It doesn't specify which side of the door I need to be on, just that I need to be in front of it and it connects room_3 and room_4. So I think my plan is valid regardless of which room I'm in, as long as I'm in front of the door. Given that I start in room_4, the plan I've given seems to be the most efficient.

So the final plan is:
```
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3
toggle grey_door_1
```

Wait, actually, let me be extra careful that I'm getting the syntax of "gotodoor" right, since I didn't it's not 100% clear to me what the parameters should be.

The action is defined as:
"goto door": you may only go in front of a door d if (i) you are in a room which door d is connecting with another room, and (ii) there is no object blocking the position in front of d in the room you are currently in.

And the example given is:
"gotodoor d r1 r2": Go in front of door d, connecting room r1 to room r2.

So it's "gotodoor <door> <room_from> <room_to>". In our case, since I'm in room_4, it would be "gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3". This seems to align with my previous interpretation.

Now, let's check the final plan one more time:

```
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3
toggle grey_door_1
```

This seems correct. I'll be in front of grey_door_1, which will be unlocked, and grey_door_1 connects room_3 and room_4.

So, the final plan is:

```
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3
toggle grey_door_1
```
