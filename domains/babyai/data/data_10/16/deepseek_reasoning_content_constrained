Okay, let's tackle this planning problem step by step. The goal is to end up in front of the grey door (grey_door_1) connecting room_3 and room_4, with it unlocked. But there are a bunch of constraints to satisfy along the way. Let me break it down.

First, the initial state: I'm in room_4. The grey door is locked. The grey door connects room_3 and room_4. So, to get to room_3, I need to unlock the grey door. But the problem is, all doors are initially locked. So I need to find a way to unlock doors to move between rooms.

Looking at the constraints:

1. The grey door must be unlocked at some point (since the final goal is it being not locked). Also, there's a constraint that "grey_door_1 is not locked" must have been preceded by me holding an object. So I need to pick up something before unlocking it.

2. The grey door must also be in a locked state at some point. Since it starts locked, maybe just leaving it locked initially counts, but I might have to toggle it again later. Wait, but the final goal is it being unlocked. Hmm. So perhaps we need to lock and then unlock it again? But that might complicate things. Wait, the constraint says "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'grey_door_1 is locked'". Since it starts locked, maybe that's already satisfied. But if we unlock it and then lock it again, that would also satisfy it. But maybe we don't need to do that. Let's note that.

3. When grey_door_1 is locked in some state s, then either I'm in front of green_ball_1 or purple_ball_1 at s or after. So if I ever have grey_door_1 locked after the initial state, I need to ensure that after that, I get in front of one of those balls. But since the initial state already has it locked, maybe that's the state s. So in that case, after the initial state, I need to eventually be in front of green_ball_1 or purple_ball_1. But green_ball_1 is in room_4 (from the initial state), and purple_ball_1 is in room_3. So if I start in room_4, maybe I can go in front of green_ball_1 first. But how?

Wait, I'm in room_4. green_ball_1 is in room_4. So I can gotoobject green_ball_1 room_4. Then pick it up. But let's check the constraints. Also, the plan needs to have me holding some object at least once. Which this would satisfy.

Another constraint: "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'you are holding some object'". So picking up any object would satisfy that. Also, another constraint says "At least one of the following conditions is true: 'you are holding purple_ball_1' or 'you are holding some object'". So that's covered by any holding.

Another constraint: "you are in room_3" must hold at least once. So I need to get to room_3.

Another constraint: "At least one of: you are in room_3 or yellow_door_1 is not locked". Since yellow_door_1 starts locked, and we might have to unlock it. But if I get to room_3, that condition is satisfied.

Another constraint: "In some state, you are in front of green_door_1 and yellow_door_1 is unlocked". So I need to be in front of green_door_1 (which connects room_1 and room_3) and have yellow_door_1 unlocked. But how to get there? green_door_1 is in room_1 and room_3. Since I'm starting in room_4, getting to room_3 might require using the grey door, but that's locked. Wait, the initial doors are all locked, so how do I move?

Wait, the initial state: all doors are locked. So I can't move between rooms unless I unlock a door. But to unlock a door, I need to toggle it, which requires being in front of it. But to get in front of a door, I need to be in a room connected by that door. So for example, to get to grey_door_1 from room_4, since room_4 is connected to room_3 via grey_door_1, I can go in front of grey_door_1 in room_4. But the problem is, the door is locked. But the preconditions for gotodoor: I can go in front of a door if I'm in a room connected by it and no object is blocking the position in front of the door. Are there any objects blocking doors? The initial state doesn't mention any objects blocking doors, so maybe they are all unblocked. So in room_4, I can goto door grey_door_1 (since room_4 is connected via grey_door_1 to room_3). Then toggle it. But to toggle, I need to be in front of it, which I can do. However, the toggle action will unlock it if it's locked. So in the initial state, grey_door_1 is locked. So if I go to grey_door_1 in room_4, toggle it, it becomes unlocked. Then I can go through to room_3. But wait, the constraint says that if I ever unlock grey_door_1, I must have held an object before. But initially, I'm not holding anything. So if I unlock grey_door_1 first, that would violate the constraint. Because the constraint says if "grey_door_1 is not locked" in some state, there must be an earlier state where I was holding an object. So if I toggle grey_door_1 to unlock it, then the state after that has grey_door_1 unlocked, but before that, I need to have held an object. So I can't just go to the door and unlock it first. I need to first pick up an object, then unlock the door.

So the plan must first pick up an object. Let's see. In room_4, there's green_ball_1 and purple_box_2. So I can goto green_ball_1 in room_4, pick it up. Then go to grey_door_1 in room_4, toggle it (unlock), then go through to room_3. But then, after that, I need to drop the ball somewhere. But let's check the constraints.

Wait, the constraint about grey_door_1 being locked in some state. Since it starts locked, that's already satisfied. But when we unlock it, it's no longer locked. So the initial state has it locked, which satisfies that constraint. Then after unlocking, it's unlocked. So the "grey_door_1 is locked" holds in the initial state, so that's covered.

Another constraint: when grey_door_1 is locked (in the initial state), then in that state or after, I must be in front of green_ball_1 or purple_ball_1. Since the initial state is in room_4, and grey_door_1 is locked, but I'm not in front of any object. So that's a problem. Wait, the constraint says if the door is locked in state s, then in s or some state after, I must be in front of green_ball_1 or purple_ball_1. So in the initial state, grey_door_1 is locked. Therefore, I need to, at some point after the initial state, be in front of either green_ball_1 or purple_ball_1. Since I start in room_4, green_ball_1 is there, so I can go to it, which would satisfy that.

So steps:

1. In room_4, go to green_ball_1.

2. Pick it up. Now I'm holding an object, which satisfies several constraints.

3. Then, go to grey_door_1 in room_4.

4. Toggle it (unlock), which requires being in front of it. Now grey_door_1 is unlocked.

But the constraint says that unlocking grey_door_1 must have been preceded by holding an object. Since we picked up the ball before unlocking, that's satisfied.

Now, after unlocking grey_door_1, we can go to room_3 via gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1. That gets us to room_3, which is another constraint (must be in room_3 at least once).

Once in room_3, there's purple_ball_1, blue_ball_1, yellow_ball_1, and purple_box_1. Another constraint requires being in front of purple_ball_1 at some point. So maybe after entering room_3, go to purple_ball_1, then maybe drop the green_ball_1 here.

But wait, the final goal is to be in front of grey_door_1 (which connects room_3 and room_4) with it unlocked. So after toggling it in room_4, we went to room_3. But we need to end up in front of grey_door_1 in room_3 or room_4? The goal says "you are in front of d" where d is the grey door. So after unlocking, we can go back to room_4 and be in front of it, or stay in room_3 and be in front of it. Wait, the door connects room_3 and room_4. So in room_3, the grey_door_1 is present. So to be in front of grey_door_1, we can be in either room_3 or room_4, but need to be in front of it. Let me check the problem statement again.

The final goal is: "There is a door d such that 'd is grey', 'room_3 and room_4 are connected via d', 'you are in front of d', 'd is not locked'". So d is grey_door_1. So to be in front of d, I can be in room_3 or room_4. But since I need to end there, perhaps after unlocking it, I can go back to room_4 and be in front of it again, but that might not be necessary. Alternatively, after entering room_3, go to grey_door_1 in room_3 and be in front of it there.

But let's think through the steps.

After unlocking grey_door_1 in room_4, we go to room_3. Then, in room_3, we can go to grey_door_1 (since it's connecting room_3 and room_4). Then, we are in front of it. Since we've already unlocked it, the final goal is satisfied. But wait, when we toggled it in room_4, it became unlocked. So the final state would require being in front of it (in room_3 or 4) and it being unlocked.

But let's check the constraints again. Another constraint requires that in some state, "you are in room_3". So entering room_3 is necessary. Also, the constraint that "you are in front of purple_ball_1" must hold. So in room_3, we can go to purple_ball_1.

Another constraint: "The following conditions are all true in some state: you are in room_3, you are holding purple_box_1". So we need to pick up purple_box_1 in room_3.

But purple_box_1 is in room_3. So after entering room_3, we can go to purple_box_1, pick it up. Then drop it somewhere else if needed.

Also, the constraint that "If you are in front of grey_door_1, then there must be a previous state where purple_box_1 is in room_1". Wait, that's a tricky one. So whenever I'm in front of grey_door_1, I must have previously had purple_box_1 in room_1. But purple_box_1 starts in room_3. So to satisfy this, I need to move purple_box_1 to room_1 before being in front of grey_door_1. But how?

Wait, the initial state of purple_box_1 is in room_3. So to have it in room_1, I need to carry it from room_3 to room_1. But moving from room_3 to room_1 requires using the green_door_1, which connects room_1 and room_3. However, green_door_1 is initially locked. So I need to unlock it. To unlock green_door_1, I need to be in front of it. Which means being in room_1 or room_3. Since I'm in room_3, I can go to green_door_1 (in room_3), toggle it (unlock), then go to room_1. But to get to room_1 from room_3, I need to go through green_door_1. So steps:

After entering room_3, go to green_door_1 in room_3, toggle it (unlocking), then go to room_1. Then drop purple_box_1 there. But how do I carry it? Let's see.

Wait, the constraint says that if I'm in front of grey_door_1 in any state, then there's an earlier state where purple_box_1 is in room_1. So in the final state, I need to be in front of grey_door_1, so before that, purple_box_1 must have been in room_1. So I need to move purple_box_1 from room_3 to room_1.

So steps:

After entering room_3 from room_4 via grey_door_1 (now unlocked), I need to:

1. gotoobject purple_box_1 room_3.

2. pick purple_box_1 (since I'm holding green_ball_1 from earlier, I need to drop it first? Wait, no. Wait, after picking green_ball_1 in room_4, I went to grey_door_1, toggled it, then went to room_3. So I'm in room_3, holding green_ball_1. To pick up purple_box_1, I need to drop green_ball_1 first.

So:

In room_3:

3. gotoempty (to drop the green_ball_1).

4. drop green_ball_1 room_3.

Now, hands are empty.

5. gotoobject purple_box_1 room_3.

6. pick purple_box_1.

Now, holding purple_box_1. Then, need to move it to room_1.

To get to room_1 from room_3, need to go through green_door_1. But green_door_1 is locked initially. So:

7. gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_1 (since I'm in room_3, which is connected to room_1 via green_door_1).

8. toggle green_door_1 (unlocks it).

9. gotoroom room_3 room_1 green_door_1.

Now in room_1.

10. drop purple_box_1 room_1.

Now, purple_box_1 is in room_1. Now, to satisfy the constraint, whenever I'm in front of grey_door_1, there's an earlier state where purple_box_1 is in room_1. So after this, I can proceed to go back to room_3 and then to room_4, but let's see.

Wait, after dropping purple_box_1 in room_1, I need to get back to room_3. So:

11. gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3.

12. toggle green_door_1 (if it's unlocked, toggling would lock it again? Wait, no. The problem says that when you toggle a door, it toggles the state. So if it's unlocked, toggling locks it. But maybe we don't need to lock it again. But for the plan, perhaps we can leave it unlocked.

But maybe the constraints don't care. Let's proceed.

13. gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1.

Now back in room_3.

Now, need to get in front of grey_door_1. So in room_3:

14. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4.

15. Now, in front of grey_door_1. Since we've already moved purple_box_1 to room_1, the constraint is satisfied.

But the door is already unlocked from earlier. So the final goal requires being in front of grey_door_1 (which we are now) and it's not locked (which it is). So this would satisfy the goal.

But wait, the current state is in room_3, in front of grey_door_1, which is unlocked. So the goal is achieved.

But let's check all the constraints again.

Constraints:

1. "grey_door_1 is not locked" in some state: achieved when we toggled it in room_4.

2. If "grey_door_1 is not locked" in a state, then earlier state with holding an object: yes, we picked up green_ball_1 before unlocking.

3. "grey_door_1 is locked" in some state: initial state, so that's covered.

4. If "grey_door_1 is locked" in state s, then in s or after, be in front of green_ball_1 or purple_ball_1. The initial state has it locked, and after that, we go to green_ball_1 in room_4, so that's satisfied.

5. "At least one of holding purple_ball_1 or some object": we held green_ball_1, so covered.

6. "you are holding some object": yes, when we picked up green_ball_1 and purple_box_1.

7. "you are in room_3": yes, when we moved there.

8. "you are in room_3 or yellow_door_1 unlocked": we were in room_3.

9. "In front of green_door_1 and yellow_door_1 unlocked": when we were in front of green_door_1 in room_3 (step 7), was yellow_door_1 unlocked? No, yellow_door_1 connects room_2 and room_4. It starts locked. Unless we unlock it. But we didn't touch yellow_door_1. So this constraint is not yet satisfied. Oh, this is a problem.

Wait, the constraint says "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'The following conditions are all true: you are in front of green_door_1, yellow_door_1 is not locked'". So in some state, I must be in front of green_door_1 (which connects room_1 and room_3) and yellow_door_1 (connecting room_2 and room_4) must be unlocked.

But yellow_door_1 is initially locked. So to satisfy this, I need to have yellow_door_1 unlocked at some point when I'm in front of green_door_1.

How can I unlock yellow_door_1? To unlock it, I need to be in front of it. But yellow_door_1 is in room_2 and room_4. I'm starting in room_4, so maybe I can unlock it from there. But when I first go to room_4, but initially, all doors are locked. So to get to yellow_door_1 in room_4, I need to be in room_4. Then goto yellow_door_1 (which connects room_4 and room_2). But in room_4, can I go to yellow_door_1? Yes. Then toggle it. But when would I do this?

Wait, in the initial plan steps I outlined earlier, after unlocking grey_door_1 and moving to room_3, I didn't touch yellow_door_1. So that constraint isn't satisfied. So I need to find a way to unlock yellow_door_1 and be in front of green_door_1.

Alternatively, maybe after moving purple_box_1 to room_1, I need to unlock yellow_door_1, then go to green_door_1 while yellow_door_1 is unlocked.

But how to get to yellow_door_1. Let's think.

After step 10, purple_box_1 is in room_1, and I'm in room_1 (after dropping it). Wait, no, step 10 is in room_1. Then step 11 is gotodoor green_door_1 in room_1, then step 12 is toggle it (but it was unlocked, so toggling would lock it again). Then step 13 is going back to room_3. But perhaps this is complicating.

Alternative approach: Maybe after unlocking grey_door_1 and entering room_3, before moving purple_box_1 to room_1, I need to handle the yellow_door_1 constraint.

Alternatively, perhaps after unlocking grey_door_1 and entering room_3, I can go back to room_4, then unlock yellow_door_1, then go to room_2, then somehow get to green_door_1. But this seems lengthy.

Alternatively, let's think of a different path. Let's start in room_4.

1. gotoobject green_ball_1 room_4.

2. pick green_ball_1.

3. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3.

4. toggle grey_door_1 (unlock).

5. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1. Now in room_3.

6. gotoempty room_3.

7. drop green_ball_1 room_3.

8. Now, need to unlock green_door_1 to go to room_1.

9. gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_1.

10. toggle green_door_1 (unlock).

11. gotoroom room_3 room_1 green_door_1. Now in room_1.

12. gotoobject purple_box_1 room_1 (but wait, purple_box_1 is initially in room_3. So how is it in room_1? Wait, no. Wait, in the initial state, purple_box_1 is in room_3. So to get it to room_1, I need to carry it there. So steps are:

Wait, in the previous steps, after dropping green_ball_1 in room_3, I need to pick up purple_box_1 and carry it to room_1. But to pick it up, I need to be in room_3.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let's try to outline all steps again, ensuring all constraints are met.

Alternative Plan:

Starting in room_4.

1. gotoobject green_ball_1 room_4.

2. pick green_ball_1. (Now holding an object, satisfies constraints.)

3. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_2. (Need to check if any object is blocking. Assuming not.)

4. toggle yellow_door_1 (unlock). Now yellow_door_1 is unlocked.

5. gotoroom room_4 room_2 yellow_door_1. Now in room_2.

6. gotoobject red_box_1 room_2. (But why? Maybe not necessary. Wait, need to get to green_door_1 in room_1 or room_3. But how?)

Alternatively, after unlocking yellow_door_1, go to room_2, then to room_1 via purple_door_1 (which is locked). Wait, purple_door_1 connects room_1 and room_2, but it's locked initially. So to unlock it, need to be in front of it in room_2 or room_1.

But perhaps this is getting too convoluted. Let's think again.

The constraint that requires being in front of green_door_1 with yellow_door_1 unlocked. So when I'm in front of green_door_1 (which is in room_1 or room_3), yellow_door_1 must be unlocked. So maybe I can unlock yellow_door_1 first, then go to green_door_1.

But how to do that.

Starting in room_4:

1. gotoobject green_ball_1 room_4.

2. pick green_ball_1.

3. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_2.

4. toggle yellow_door_1 (unlock).

5. Now, yellow_door_1 is unlocked. Then, need to go to green_door_1. But green_door_1 is in room_1 and room_3. To get there from room_4, need to go through room_2 to room_1 via purple_door_1, but that's locked. Or through room_3 via grey_door_1 (which is still locked unless we unlock it).

Wait, but initially, grey_door_1 is locked. So to unlock grey_door_1, need to pick up an object first. But we already picked up green_ball_1. So maybe:

6. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3.

7. toggle grey_door_1 (unlock). Now grey_door_1 is unlocked.

8. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1. Now in room_3.

9. Now, need to go to green_door_1 in room_3.

10. gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_1.

11. Now, in front of green_door_1. At this point, yellow_door_1 is unlocked (from step 4), so the constraint that "in front of green_door_1 and yellow_door_1 unlocked" is satisfied here. So step 10: gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_1. Then step 11: maybe stay there, and that's the state where we're in front of green_door_1 and yellow_door_1 is unlocked.

Yes, that would satisfy the constraint. Because in step 10, we are in front of green_door_1, and yellow_door_1 was unlocked in step 4. So that's a valid state.

Then proceed to unlock green_door_1:

12. toggle green_door_1 (unlock).

13. gotoroom room_3 room_1 green_door_1. Now in room_1.

14. Now, need to move purple_box_1 from room_3 to room_1. Wait, purple_box_1 is in room_3. So I need to carry it there. But I'm currently in room_1. So perhaps after step 13, I need to go back to room_3, pick up purple_box_1, and bring it to room_1.

But I'm holding green_ball_1 until step 7. Wait, no. Let me retrace:

In step 2, I picked green_ball_1. Then in step 4, I toggled yellow_door_1 (still holding it). Then step 7, toggled grey_door_1 (still holding it). Then step 8, moved to room_3 (still holding it). Then step 10, goto green_door_1 in room_3 (still holding it). Step 12, toggle green_door_1 (unlock), still holding it. Then step 13, move to room_1, still holding it. But to drop it somewhere:

14. gotoempty room_1.

15. drop green_ball_1 room_1. Now hands are empty.

16. Now, need to go back to room_3 to get purple_box_1.

17. gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3.

18. toggle green_door_1 (lock it again? Or is it unlocked? After step 12, it's unlocked. Toggling would lock it. But we don't need to lock it. But to go back, since it's unlocked, we can just go through.

19. gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1. Now in room_3.

20. gotoobject purple_box_1 room_3.

21. pick purple_box_1.

22. gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_1.

23. toggle green_door_1 (if it's locked, unlock it). But after step 19, it was unlocked, so step 18 would have locked it again. Wait, this is getting confusing. Let's track the door states:

- yellow_door_1: unlocked in step 4.

- grey_door_1: unlocked in step 7.

- green_door_1: unlocked in step 12.

- purple_door_1: remains locked.

So after step 13, green_door_1 is unlocked. When we go back to room_3 in step 19, we don't need to toggle it again because it's already unlocked. So step 17: gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3.

Step 18: toggle green_door_1. This would lock it again. But we don't need to do that. So perhaps instead, after step 13, when in room_1, we can just go back to room_3 through the unlocked green_door_1 without toggling.

So step 14: drop green_ball_1 in room_1.

Step 15: gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1. (Since green_door_1 is unlocked.)

Now in room_3. Then pick up purple_box_1.

Step 16: gotoobject purple_box_1 room_3.

Step 17: pick purple_box_1.

Step 18: gotoroom room_3 room_1 green_door_1. Back to room_1.

Step 19: drop purple_box_1 room_1.

Now, purple_box_1 is in room_1, satisfying the constraint that if I'm in front of grey_door_1, there was a previous state with purple_box_1 in room_1.

Then, need to get back to grey_door_1. So from room_1, go to room_3 via green_door_1 (unlocked), then to room_4 via grey_door_1 (unlocked), then goto grey_door_1 in room_4.

But the goal is to be in front of grey_door_1 (any side) with it unlocked. So perhaps:

From room_1:

Step 20: gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1.

Step 21: gotoroom room_3 room_4 grey_door_1.

Step 22: gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3.

Now in front of grey_door_1 in room_4. It's unlocked. So this satisfies the goal.

But also need to check other constraints:

- "you are in front of grey_door_1" must hold in some state. This is step 22.

- The constraint that when in front of grey_door_1, there's an earlier state with purple_box_1 in room_1. Which is satisfied after step 19.

- Also, the constraint that "you are in room_3" is satisfied in steps 8, 19, 20.

- The constraint about being in front of purple_ball_1: when in room_3, after step 8, I could have gone to purple_ball_1. But in this current plan, I didn't. So need to address that.

Wait, another constraint: "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'you are in front of purple_ball_1'". So I need to ensure that at some point, I'm in front of purple_ball_1 in room_3.

So after step 8 (in room_3), I should go to purple_ball_1.

Let's adjust the plan:

After step 8 (in room_3):

9. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_3.

10. Then proceed to drop green_ball_1, etc.

But when I'm holding green_ball_1, I can't pick up purple_ball_1. So after step 8:

9. gotoempty room_3.

10. drop green_ball_1 room_3.

11. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_3.

Now in front of purple_ball_1. Then pick it up? No, but we need to satisfy the constraint of being in front of it. So just being in front of it satisfies that constraint.

So step 11: gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_3.

Now, in front of purple_ball_1. That satisfies the constraint. Then proceed to pick up purple_box_1.

But this complicates the plan. Let's integrate this.

Revised Plan:

1. gotoobject green_ball_1 room_4.

2. pick green_ball_1.

3. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_2.

4. toggle yellow_door_1 (unlock).

5. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3.

6. toggle grey_door_1 (unlock).

7. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1.

8. gotoempty room_3.

9. drop green_ball_1 room_3.

10. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_3. (Satisfies the constraint.)

11. gotoobject purple_box_1 room_3.

12. pick purple_box_1.

13. gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_1.

14. toggle green_door_1 (unlock).

15. gotoroom room_3 room_1 green_door_1.

16. drop purple_box_1 room_1.

17. gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1.

18. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4.

19. Now, in front of grey_door_1 in room_3. It's unlocked. So this satisfies the goal.

But need to check all constraints:

- "In front of green_door_1 with yellow_door_1 unlocked": step 13 is in front of green_door_1 in room_3, and yellow_door_1 was unlocked in step 4. So yes.

- "you are in front of purple_ball_1": step 10.

- "you are in room_3": multiple times.

- "holding purple_box_1 in room_3": step 12 (picked it up in room_3).

- "you are in front of grey_door_1": step 19.

- "purple_box_1 is in room_1" before step 19: yes, step 16.

All constraints seem satisfied now.

But wait, when do we satisfy the "you are in front of green_door_1 and yellow_door_1 is unlocked"? That would be step 13: gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_1 (step 13). At this point, yellow_door_1 is unlocked (from step 4), so this state satisfies that constraint.

Yes.

Now, the final step is to be in front of grey_door_1 with it unlocked.

So steps:

After step 17, we are back in room_3.

18. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4.

19. Now in front of grey_door_1, which is unlocked. This satisfies the goal.

Thus, the plan would be:

```
gotoobject green_ball_1 room_4
pick green_ball_1 room_4
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_2
toggle yellow_door_1
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3
toggle grey_door_1
gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1
gotoempty room_3
drop green_ball_1 room_3
gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_3
gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_1
toggle green_door_1
gotoroom room_3 room_1 green_door_1
drop purple_box_1 room_1
gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4
```

Wait, but after dropping purple_box_1 in room_1 (step 16), we need to go back to room_3. So step 17 is gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1. Then step 18 is gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4. Then we are in front of it, which is unlocked. This meets the goal.

But let's count the steps to ensure all actions are valid.

But wait, after step 16 (drop purple_box_1 in room_1), we need to go back to room_3. So:

17. gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1.

18. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4.

Now in front of grey_door_1 in room_3, which is unlocked. So this is the final state.

Yes, this should work.

Let me check each action's preconditions:

1. gotoobject green_ball_1 room_4: in room_4, valid.

2. pick green_ball_1 room_4: holding nothing, valid.

3. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_2: in room_4, which is connected via yellow_door_1. Assuming no object blocking. Valid.

4. toggle yellow_door_1: in front of it. Valid.

5. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3: in room_4, connected via grey_door_1. Valid.

6. toggle grey_door_1: in front of it. Valid.

7. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1: door is unlocked. Valid.

8. gotoempty room_3: valid.

9. drop green_ball_1 room_3: holding it, valid.

10. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_3: in room_3. Valid.

11. gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_1: in room_3, connected via green_door_1. Valid.

12. toggle green_door_1: in front of it. Valid.

13. gotoroom room_3 room_1 green_door_1: door is unlocked. Valid.

14. drop purple_box_1 room_1: holding it. Valid.

15. gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1: door is unlocked. Valid.

16. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4: in room_3, connected via grey_door_1. Valid.

At this point, we're in front of grey_door_1, which is unlocked. This meets the goal.

All constraints are satisfied:

- grey_door_1 is unlocked (step 6).

- Before unlocking grey_door_1, we held green_ball_1 (steps 2-6).

- grey_door_1 was locked initially (step 0).

- When grey_door_1 was locked (initial state), after that, we were in front of green_ball_1 (step 1).

- Held some object (steps 2-9 and 12-14).

- In room_3 (steps 7 onwards).

- In front of green_door_1 (step 11) with yellow_door_1 unlocked (step 4).

- In front of purple_ball_1 (step 10).

- In room_3 holding purple_box_1 (step 12-13: no, step 12 is toggling green_door_1, then step 13 is moving to room_1. Wait, step 12 is pick purple_box_1 in room_3? Let me check.

Wait, in the current plan after step 10 (gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_3), step 11 is gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_1. Then step 12: toggle green_door_1. Then step 13: move to room_1. But where is purple_box_1 picked up?

Ah, there's a mistake here. After step 10 (gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_3), the next step should be to pick up purple_box_1, but we haven't done that yet. So the plan I outlined earlier missed picking up purple_box_1.

Wait, let's correct this:

Revised steps after step 10 (gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_3):

11. gotoobject purple_box_1 room_3.

12. pick purple_box_1 room_3.

13. gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_1.

14. toggle green_door_1.

15. gotoroom room_3 room_1 green_door_1.

16. drop purple_box_1 room_1.

17. gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1.

18. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4.

So the corrected plan includes picking up purple_box_1 after being in front of purple_ball_1.

But to pick up purple_box_1, we need to be in front of it. So after step 10 (gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_3), we need to go to purple_box_1.

But how? Purple_box_1 is in room_3. So:

After step 10: gotoobject purple_box_1 room_3.

Then pick it up.

But after step 9, we dropped green_ball_1 in room_3. So hands are empty. So steps:

10. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_3. (Satisfy constraint.)

11. gotoobject purple_box_1 room_3.

12. pick purple_box_1 room_3.

13. gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_1.

14. toggle green_door_1.

15. gotoroom room_3 room_1 green_door_1.

16. drop purple_box_1 room_1.

17. gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1.

18. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4.

Now, in front of grey_door_1 in room_3, which is unlocked.

This should cover all steps correctly.

But let's verify all preconditions:

Step 11: gotoobject purple_box_1 room_3. In room_3, valid.

Step 12: pick purple_box_1. In room_3, hands empty. Valid.

Step 13: gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_1. In room_3, valid.

Step 14: toggle green_door_1. In front of it. Valid.

Step 15: gotoroom room_3 room_1 green_door_1. Door unlocked. Valid.

Step 16: drop purple_box_1 room_1. Holding it. Valid.

Step 17: gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1. Door unlocked. Valid.

Step 18: gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4. In room_3, valid.

Now, all steps are valid.

This plan meets all constraints and the final goal.
