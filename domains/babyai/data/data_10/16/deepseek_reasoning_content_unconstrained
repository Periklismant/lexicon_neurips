Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. The goal is to get to a grey door connecting room_3 and room_4, be in front of it, and have it unlocked. The constraints aren't listed here, but from the initial state, I need to figure out the steps.

First, let's look at the initial state. The agent is in room_4. The doors are all locked. The grey door (grey_door_1) connects room_3 and room_4. So, the target door is grey_door_1. The goal is to be in front of it, in room_3 or room_4, and have it unlocked.

But wait, the agent starts in room_4. To get to the grey door, maybe they need to go to room_4's side of the door. But since all doors are locked initially, they need to unlock grey_door_1. But to toggle a door, they need to be in front of it. So how do they get there if the door is locked?

Wait, the doors connect rooms. So, to be in front of grey_door_1, they can be in either room_3 or room_4. Since the agent is in room_4 initially, maybe they can go to the door from room_4. But the door is locked. But the action "toggle d" requires being in front of d. So first, go to the door, then toggle it to unlock.

Wait, but the doors are all locked. The problem is that to go through a door, it needs to be unlocked. But here, maybe the agent doesn't need to go through the door, just be in front of it. But the "gotodoor d r1 r2" action requires that there's no object blocking the position in front of d in the current room. Are any objects blocking doors in room_4?

Looking at the initial state, room_4 has green_ball_1 and purple_box_2. Are these objects blocking any doors? The problem statement doesn't mention which doors are blocked by objects. Wait, the preconditions for "gotodoor d r1 r2" require that there's no object blocking the position in front of d in the current room. But the initial state doesn't state any objects blocking doors. So maybe all doors are unblocked initially. Unless there's an object in front of the door. But the initial state doesn't mention that. So perhaps the agent can go to the door in room_4 (grey_door_1) since room_4 is connected via grey_door_1 to room_3. So the agent is in room_4, can perform "gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3". Then, toggle it to unlock. Then, that's the goal.

Wait, but the goal is to have the door d (which is grey) connecting room_3 and room_4, be in front of d, and d is not locked. So once the agent is in front of grey_door_1 and toggles it (unlocking it), that satisfies the goal. Let's check the steps.

Initial steps:

1. The agent is in room_4. They need to go to the grey door (grey_door_1) which connects room_4 and room_3. So, perform "gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3". But first, check if that's possible. The precondition is that the agent is in a room connected by the door (yes, room_4) and there's no object blocking the door's position in room_4. Since the initial state doesn't mention any objects blocking doors, this should be possible.

2. Then, perform "toggle grey_door_1" to unlock it. Now, the door is unlocked, and the agent is in front of it. That should meet the goal.

But wait, the goal requires the agent to be in front of d (grey_door_1), d is grey, connects room_3 and room_4, and is not locked. So after these two actions, the goal is achieved. That seems too easy. But let's check if there's any constraints or other factors.

Wait, the initial state says that all doors are locked. So grey_door_1 is locked. So to unlock it, the agent needs to toggle it. But to toggle, they need to be in front of it. So first, "gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3" (since the agent is in room_4), then "toggle grey_door_1" which will unlock it. Then, the agent is in front of the grey door, which is now unlocked. That meets the goal.

So the plan would be:

```
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3
toggle grey_door_1
```

But wait, the "gotodoor" action's syntax is "gotodoor d r1 r2", where r1 and r2 are the rooms connected by door d. The grey_door_1 connects room_4 and room_3, so the action would be "gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3" when in room_4. That's valid. Then toggle.

So this two-step plan should work. But let me check for any possible constraints or obstacles. For example, are there any objects in front of the door in room_4 that would block the agent from going there? The initial state lists objects in room_4 as green_ball_1 and purple_box_2. But unless they are positioned in front of the door, which isn't specified, the assumption is that the door is accessible. So the plan is valid.

I think this is the optimal plan with two actions. Maybe there's a shorter one, but this seems correct.
