Alright, I need to understand the problem and find a plan to solve it.

Let's first understand the goal: We need to be in room_2, and in front of a grey ball in room_2.

From the initial state, I can see that there are already two grey balls in room_2: grey_ball_1 and grey_ball_2. So, I need to:
1. Go to room_2 from room_1.
2. Go in front of either grey_ball_1 or grey_ball_2.

Starting from room_1, to go to room_2, I need to use blue_door_1. However, this door is locked. So, I need to:
1. Go to blue_door_1 in room_1.
2. Toggle blue_door_1 to unlock it.
3. Go to room_2 from room_1 using blue_door_1.
4. Go in front of one of the grey balls in room_2.

Now let's create a plan:

1. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2  // Go in front of blue_door_1 from room_1.
2. toggle blue_door_1  // Unlock blue_door_1.
3. gotoroom room_1 room_2 blue_door_1  // Go from room_1 to room_2 using blue_door_1.
4. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_2  // Go in front of grey_ball_1 in room_2.

Let's double-check if this plan satisfies the problem:
- We start in room_1.
- We go to blue_door_1 and toggle it (unlock it).
- We go from room_1 to room_2 using blue_door_1.
- We go in front of grey_ball_1 in room_2.

At the end, we are in room_2 and in front of grey_ball_1, which is a grey ball. This should satisfy the goal condition. Let's check if each step is valid based on the action preconditions and effects:

1. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2
   Preconditions: We are in room_1, and blue_door_1 connects room_1 and room_2. No object is blocking the door.
   Effects: We are no longer in front of any object, and we are in front of blue_door_1.

2. toggle blue_door_1
   Preconditions: We are in front of blue_door_1.
   Effects: blue_door_1 is unlocked (since it was locked initially).

3. gotoroom room_1 room_2 blue_door_1
   Preconditions: We are in room_1, room_1 is adjacent to room_2, blue_door_1 connects them, and blue_door_1 is unlocked.
   Effects: We are no longer in room_1, we are in room_2, we have visited room_2, and we are not in front of any object.

4. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_2
   Preconditions: We are in room_2, and grey_ball_1 is in room_2.
   Effects: We are in front of grey_ball_1.

All steps are valid and satisfy their preconditions. Let's review the final state:
- We are in room_2.
- We are in front of grey_ball_1, which is a grey ball in room_2.

This satisfies the goal.

Let me reorder the plan to ensure optimality:

1. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2
2. toggle blue_door_1
3. gotoroom room_1 room_2 blue_door_1
4. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_2

This seems optimal, as it takes the most direct path to achieve the goal without any redundant actions.

So, the optimal plan is:
```
gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2
toggle blue_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_2 blue_door_1
gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_2
```

Actually, looking at the action definitions more carefully, I realize there's a potential issue. The "gotoobject" action allows us to go in front of an object if we are in the same room. It's unclear if "gotodoor" needs to be performed first to be in front of a door, but let's assume it does. I'll maintain my plan.

Actually, let me also quickly check if there are any other constraints or conditions that I need to account for. The goal is to have a grey ball in room_2, be in room_2, and be in front of that grey ball. The plan I provided does this exactly.

Let's verify once more:
1. We start in room_1.
2. We go to blue_door_1 and toggle it.
3. We go to room_2 using blue_door_1.
4. We go in front of one of the grey balls (grey_ball_1) in room_2.

This plan moves us to room_2 and places us in front of a grey ball. Thus, the goal is satisfied. The plan is also valid, as all action preconditions are met.

So the final plan is:
```
gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2
toggle blue_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_2 blue_door_1
gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_2
```

Actually, I'm not sure about the semantics of the `gotodoor` action. Let me review it once more. The `gotodoor` action requires us to go in front of a door `d` if we are in a room which door `d` is connecting with another room. In this case, I'm in room_1, and blue_door_1 is connecting room_1 and room_2. So I do need to go in front of blue_door_1 first before I can toggle it and go through it.

So the plan is indeed:
```
gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2
toggle blue_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_2 blue_door_1
gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_2
```

I think this plan is valid and optimal.
