I'll analyze the problem and find an optimal plan.

First, let's understand the initial state:
- I am in room_1
- red_box_1 and yellow_box_1 are in room_1
- grey_ball_1 and grey_ball_2 are in room_2
- grey_ball_3 is in room_3
- green_box_1, yellow_ball_1, and green_ball_1 are in room_4
- All doors are locked (blue_door_1, red_door_1, purple_door_1, blue_door_2)
- The room connections are as follows:
  - blue_door_1 connects room_1 and room_2
  - red_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3
  - purple_door_1 connects room_2 and room_4
  - blue_door_2 connects room_3 and room_4

The goal is to be in room_2, in front of a grey ball, with the grey ball in room_2.

Let's look at the constraints:
1. I must be in front of green_box_1 at some point
2. blue_door_1 must always remain locked
3. I must be in front of blue_door_1 at some point
4. If I'm in front of blue_door_1, I must be holding red_box_1 at that point or later
5. I must hold grey_ball_1 at some point
6. I must hold green_box_1 at some point
7. At some point, I must be holding an object while in room_3
8. I must be in room_2 at some point
9. Before going to room_2, I must be holding some object
10. At some point, I must be holding grey_ball_1 while green_box_1 is in room_2
11. I must be in room_1 at some point (already satisfied in the initial state)
12. If I'm in room_1, I must go to room_3 at that point or later
13. purple_door_1 must be unlocked at some point

Now, I need to plan how to satisfy these constraints and achieve the goal. The goal is to have a grey ball in room_2, with me in room_2 and in front of the grey ball. Since grey_ball_1 and grey_ball_2 are already in room_2, I can use one of them. But I need to be holding an object before entering room_2 (constraint 9), and I also need to be holding grey_ball_1 at some point when green_box_1 is in room_2 (constraint 10).

Let me sketch a rough plan:
1. Start in room_1
2. Pick up red_box_1 (to satisfy constraint 4 later)
3. Go to the red_door_1 and unlock it (to satisfy constraint 12)
4. Go to room_3 (satisfying constraint 12)
5. Drop red_box_1
6. Go to grey_ball_3 and pick it up (to satisfy constraint 7)
7. Go to blue_door_2 and unlock it
8. Go to room_4
9. Go to green_box_1 and drop grey_ball_3 (to satisfy constraint 1)
10. Pick up green_box_1 (to satisfy constraint 6)
11. Go to purple_door_1 and unlock it (to satisfy constraint 13)
12. Go to room_2 (now satisfying constraint 8 since I'm holding green_box_1, which satisfies constraint 9)
13. Drop green_box_1 in room_2 (this satisfies constraint 10 when I later pick up grey_ball_1)
14. Go to grey_ball_1 and pick it up (satisfying constraint 5)
15. Go to blue_door_1 (satisfying constraint 3) while holding red_box_1 (satisfying constraint 4)
16. Drop grey_ball_1
17. Pick up grey_ball_1 again (now green_box_1 is in room_2 and I'm holding grey_ball_1, satisfying constraint 10)
18. Be in front of grey_ball_1 (somehow?), achieving the goal

Wait, there's a problem with this plan. I can't be holding grey_ball_1 and be in front of it at the same time. Let me revise the plan.

Actually, let's think about the goal more carefully. I need to be in room_2, in front of a grey ball, with the grey ball in room_2. This means I should drop the grey ball in room_2 and then go in front of it. I can use either grey_ball_1 or grey_ball_2 for this, as they're already in room_2.

Let me revise the plan:

1. Start in room_1
2. Pick up red_box_1 
3. Go to red_door_1, unlock it
4. Go to room_3 (satisfying constraint 12)
5. While holding red_box_1 in room_3 (satisfying constraint 7)
6. Go to grey_ball_3 and drop red_box_1
7. Pick up grey_ball_3
8. Go to blue_door_2, unlock it
9. Go to room_4
10. Go to green_box_1 (satisfying constraint 1)
11. Drop grey_ball_3
12. Pick up green_box_1 (satisfying constraint 6)
13. Go to purple_door_1, unlock it (satisfying constraint 13)
14. Go to room_2 (satisfying constraint 8 since I'm holding green_box_1, which satisfies constraint 9)
15. Drop green_box_1 in room_2
16. Go to grey_ball_1
17. Pick up grey_ball_1 (satisfying constraint 5, and now green_box_1 is in room_2 and I'm holding grey_ball_1, satisfying constraint 10)
18. Go to blue_door_1 (satisfying constraint 3) 
19. Drop grey_ball_1
20. Go to grey_ball_1
21. This achieves the goal: I'm in room_2, in front of grey_ball_1, and grey_ball_1 is in room_2

But wait, there's an issue. According to constraint 4, if I'm in front of blue_door_1, I need to be holding red_box_1 at that point or later. But I left red_box_1 in room_3. Let me revise again.

Alright, I see a path now. Let me carefully plan each step.

1. Start in room_1 with red_box_1 and yellow_box_1
2. First, I'll go to red_box_1, pick it up
3. Go to red_door_1, unlock it
4. Go to room_3 (satisfying "if in room_1, then must go to room_3")
5. In room_3 with red_box_1, satisfying "holding some object in room_3"
6. Go to grey_ball_3, drop red_box_1
7. Pick up grey_ball_3
8. Go to blue_door_2, unlock it
9. Go to room_4
10. Go to green_box_1, satisfying "must be in front of green_box_1"
11. Drop grey_ball_3
12. Pick up green_box_1, satisfying "must hold green_box_1"
13. Go to purple_door_1, unlock it, satisfying "purple_door_1 must be unlocked"
14. Go to room_2, satisfying "must be in room_2" and since I'm holding green_box_1, I satisfy "before going to room_2, must hold some object"
15. Drop green_box_1 in room_2
16. Go to grey_ball_1
17. Pick up grey_ball_1, satisfying "must hold grey_ball_1" and since green_box_1 is in room_2, I satisfy "holding grey_ball_1 while green_box_1 is in room_2"
18. Go to blue_door_1, satisfying "must be in front of blue_door_1"
19. But now I need to satisfy "if in front of blue_door_1, must hold red_box_1 at that point or later"
20. So I can't complete the plan this way...

Let me think again. I need to be holding red_box_1 at or after being in front of blue_door_1. But I also need to satisfy many other constraints.

I think I need to cycle through the rooms. Let me try a different approach:

1. Start in room_1
2. Go to blue_door_1 (satisfying "must be in front of blue_door_1" but not yet triggering the need to hold red_box_1 since I'll come back to it)
3. Go to red_box_1, pick it up
4. Go to red_door_1, unlock it
5. Go to room_3 (satisfying "if in room_1, go to room_3")
6. In room_3 with red_box_1, satisfying "holding some object in room_3"
7. Go to grey_ball_3, drop red_box_1
8. Pick up grey_ball_3
9. Go to blue_door_2, unlock it
10. Go to room_4
11. Go to green_box_1, satisfying "must be in front of green_box_1"
12. Drop grey_ball_3
13. Pick up green_box_1, satisfying "must hold green_box_1"
14. Go to purple_door_1, unlock it, satisfying "purple_door_1 must be unlocked"
15. Go to room_2, satisfying "must be in room_2" and since I'm holding green_box_1, I satisfy "before going to room_2, must hold some object"
16. Drop green_box_1 in room_2
17. Go to grey_ball_1
18. Pick up grey_ball_1, satisfying "must hold grey_ball_1" and since green_box_1 is in room_2, I satisfy "holding grey_ball_1 while green_box_1 is in room_2"
19. Go to room_4 via purple_door_1
20. Go to room_3 via blue_door_2
21. Go to red_box_1, drop grey_ball_1
22. Pick up red_box_1
23. Go to room_1 via red_door_1
24. Go to blue_door_1, now satisfying "if in front of blue_door_1, must hold red_box_1 at that point or later"
25. Go to room_3 via red_door_1
26. Go to grey_ball_3, drop red_box_1
27. Go to grey_ball_1, pick it up
28. Go to room_4 via blue_door_2
29. Go to room_2 via purple_door_1
30. Go to an empty position, drop grey_ball_1
31. Go to grey_ball_1, now I'm in room_2, in front of grey_ball_1, and grey_ball_1 is in room_2 (goal achieved)

Actually, this is getting overly complicated. Let me simplify and try a different approach.

Let's go through the constraints again:
1. I must be in front of green_box_1 at some point - This means I need to go to room_4 where green_box_1 starts.
2. blue_door_1 must always remain locked - I cannot use blue_door_1 to go between room_1 and room_2.
3. I must be in front of blue_door_1 at some point - I can do this from room_1.
4. If I'm in front of blue_door_1, I must be holding red_box_1 at that point or later - I need to pick up red_box_1 before or after going to blue_door_1.
5. I must hold grey_ball_1 at some point - grey_ball_1 is in room_2.
6. I must hold green_box_1 at some point - green_box_1 is in room_4.
7. At some point, I must be holding an object while in room_3 - I can hold any object in room_3.
8. I must be in room_2 at some point - This is also where the goal must be achieved.
9. Before going to room_2, I must be holding some object - I need to pick up something before entering room_2.
10. At some point, I must be holding grey_ball_1 while green_box_1 is in room_2 - I need to move green_box_1 to room_2 and then pick up grey_ball_1.
11. I must be in room_1 at some point - Already satisfied in the initial state.
12. If I'm in room_1, I must go to room_3 at that point or later - I need to go to room_3 after starting in room_1.
13. purple_door_1 must be unlocked at some point - I need to unlock purple_door_1.

Since I can't use blue_door_1 (it must remain locked), my path to room_2 has to be through room_1 -> room_3 -> room_4 -> room_2.

Let me try a new plan:

1. Start in room_1
2. Go to blue_door_1 (satisfying constraint 3)
3. Go to red_box_1, pick it up
4. Go to red_door_1, unlock it
5. Go to room_3 (satisfying constraint 12)
6. In room_3 with red_box_1, satisfying constraint 7
7. Go to blue_door_2, unlock it
8. Go to room_4
9. Go to green_box_1, satisfying constraint 1
10. Drop red_box_1
11. Pick up green_box_1, satisfying constraint 6
12. Go to purple_door_1, unlock it, satisfying constraint 13
13. Go to room_2, satisfying constraint 8 and since I'm holding green_box_1, I satisfy constraint 9
14. Drop green_box_1 in room_2
15. Go to grey_ball_1
16. Pick up grey_ball_1, satisfying constraint 5 and since green_box_1 is in room_2, I satisfy constraint 10
17. Go to an empty position, drop grey_ball_1
18. Go to grey_ball_1, now I'm in room_2, in front of grey_ball_1, and grey_ball_1 is in room_2 (goal achieved)

But wait, I'm still missing constraint 4: if I'm in front of blue_door_1, I must be holding red_box_1 at that point or later. In my plan above, I go to blue_door_1, then pick up red_box_1, but later I drop red_box_1 and never pick it up again.

I need to modify the plan to ensure I'm holding red_box_1 at the end:

1. Start in room_1
2. Go to blue_door_1 (satisfying constraint 3)
3. Go to red_box_1, pick it up
4. Go to red_door_1, unlock it
5. Go to room_3 (satisfying constraint 12)
6. In room_3 with red_box_1, satisfying constraint 7
7. Go to blue_door_2, unlock it
8. Go to room_4
9. Go to green_box_1, satisfying constraint 1
10. Drop red_box_1
11. Pick up green_box_1, satisfying constraint 6
12. Go to purple_door_1, unlock it, satisfying constraint 13
13. Go to room_2, satisfying constraint 8 and since I'm holding green_box_1, I satisfy constraint 9
14. Drop green_box_1 in room_2
15. Go to grey_ball_1
16. Pick up grey_ball_1, satisfying constraint 5 and since green_box_1 is in room_2, I satisfy constraint 10
17. Go to an empty position, drop grey_ball_1
18. Go to grey_ball_1, now I'm in room_2, in front of grey_ball_1, and grey_ball_1 is in room_2 (goal achieved)

Wait, I'm still not satisfying constraint 4. I need to ensure I'm holding red_box_1 after I've been in front of blue_door_1 at some point in the plan. But I don't need to be holding it at the end.

Actually, the constraint states: "If expression 'you are in front of blue_door_1' holds in some state s, then expression 'you are holding red_box_1' must hold at s or at some state after s". Since in my plan, I go to blue_door_1 and then immediately pick up red_box_1, I am indeed holding red_box_1 in a state after being in front of blue_door_1. So my plan does satisfy this constraint.

Let me review the plan against all constraints:

1. I must be in front of green_box_1 at some point - Satisfied in step 9.
2. blue_door_1 must always remain locked - Satisfied, I never unlock blue_door_1.
3. I must be in front of blue_door_1 at some point - Satisfied in step 2.
4. If I'm in front of blue_door_1, I must be holding red_box_1 at that point or later - Satisfied in step 3, I pick up red_box_1 right after being in front of blue_door_1.
5. I must hold grey_ball_1 at some point - Satisfied in step 16.
6. I must hold green_box_1 at some point - Satisfied in step 11.
7. At some point, I must be holding an object while in room_3 - Satisfied in step 6.
8. I must be in room_2 at some point - Satisfied in step 13.
9. Before going to room_2, I must be holding some object - Satisfied in step 13, I'm holding green_box_1.
10. At some point, I must be holding grey_ball_1 while green_box_1 is in room_2 - Satisfied in step 16.
11. I must be in room_1 at some point - Satisfied in the initial state.
12. If I'm in room_1, I must go to room_3 at that point or later - Satisfied in step 5.
13. purple_door_1 must be unlocked at some point - Satisfied in step 12.

And the goal is achieved in step 18.

Great, I think this plan satisfies all constraints and achieves the goal. Let me formalize the precise actions:

1. gotoobject blue_door_1 room_1
2. gotoobject red_box_1 room_1
3. pick red_box_1 room_1
4. gotoobject red_door_1 room_1
5. toggle red_door_1
6. gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1
7. gotoobject blue_door_2 room_3
8. toggle blue_door_2
9. gotoroom room_3 room_4 blue_door_2
10. gotoobject green_box_1 room_4
11. gotoempty
12. drop red_box_1 room_4
13. gotoobject green_box_1 room_4
14. pick green_box_1 room_4
15. gotoobject purple_door_1 room_4
16. toggle purple_door_1
17. gotoroom room_4 room_2 purple_door_1
18. gotoempty
19. drop green_box_1 room_2
20. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_2
21. pick grey_ball_1 room_2
22. gotoempty
23. drop grey_ball_1 room_2
24. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_2

Actually, there's a slight issue in the plan. In step 11-12, I go to an empty position and then drop red_box_1. But to drop an object, I need to be in front of an empty position. So I should combine these steps.

Similarly, in step 18-19, I go to an empty position and then drop green_box_1. These should be combined.

And in step 22-23, I go to an empty position and then drop grey_ball_1. These should also be combined.

Let me correct the plan:

1. gotoobject blue_door_1 room_1
2. gotoobject red_box_1 room_1
3. pick red_box_1 room_1
4. gotoobject red_door_1 room_1
5. toggle red_door_1
6. gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1
7. gotoobject blue_door_2 room_3
8. toggle blue_door_2
9. gotoroom room_3 room_4 blue_door_2
10. gotoobject green_box_1 room_4
11. gotoempty
12. drop red_box_1 room_4
13. gotoobject green_box_1 room_4
14. pick green_box_1 room_4
15. gotoobject purple_door_1 room_4
16. toggle purple_door_1
17. gotoroom room_4 room_2 purple_door_1
18. gotoempty
19. drop green_box_1 room_2
20. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_2
21. pick grey_ball_1 room_2
22. gotoempty
23. drop grey_ball_1 room_2
24. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_2

Wait, I notice I'm still not perfectly clear on how some of the actions work. Let me review the action descriptions one more time:

"goto empty": you may go in front of an empty position anytime.
"drop": you may only drop an object x if (i) you are currently holding x, and (ii) the position in front of you is empty.

So, "gotoempty" means going in front of an empty position, and then I can drop the object I'm holding there. This means my plan is correct.

Let me double check that the plan satisfies all constraints:

1. I must be in front of green_box_1 at some point - Satisfied in step 10 and 13.
2. blue_door_1 must always remain locked - Satisfied, I never unlock blue_door_1.
3. I must be in front of blue_door_1 at some point - Satisfied in step 1.
4. If I'm in front of blue_door_1, I must be holding red_box_1 at that point or later - Satisfied in step 3, I pick up red_box_1 right after being in front of blue_door_1.
5. I must hold grey_ball_1 at some point - Satisfied in step 21.
6. I must hold green_box_1 at some point - Satisfied in step 14.
7. At some point, I must be holding an object while in room_3 - Satisfied in step 6, I'm in room_3 and holding red_box_1.
8. I must be in room_2 at some point - Satisfied in step 17.
9. Before going to room_2, I must be holding some object - Satisfied in step 17, I'm holding green_box_1.
10. At some point, I must be holding grey_ball_1 while green_box_1 is in room_2 - Satisfied in step 21, I'm holding grey_ball_1 and green_box_1 is in room_2 (dropped in step 19).
11. I must be in room_1 at some point - Satisfied in the initial state.
12. If I'm in room_1, I must go to room_3 at that point or later - Satisfied in step 6.
13. purple_door_1 must be unlocked at some point - Satisfied in step 16.

The goal is achieved in step 24: I'm in room_2, in front of grey_ball_1, and grey_ball_1 is in room_2.

I think the plan is optimal, as it achieves all constraints with minimal actions.

So here's the final plan:

```
gotoobject blue_door_1 room_1
gotoobject red_box_1 room_1
pick red_box_1 room_1
gotoobject red_door_1 room_1
toggle red_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1
gotoobject blue_door_2 room_3
toggle blue_door_2
gotoroom room_3 room_4 blue_door_2
gotoobject green_box_1 room_4
gotoempty
drop red_box_1 room_4
gotoobject green_box_1 room_4
pick green_box_1 room_4
gotoobject purple_door_1 room_4
toggle purple_door_1
gotoroom room_4 room_2 purple_door_1
gotoempty
drop green_box_1 room_2
gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_2
pick grey_ball_1 room_2
gotoempty
drop grey_ball_1 room_2
gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_2
```

Actually, I just realized there's one more refinement to this plan. Let me check the description of the goal again:
"There is a ball v such that 'The following conditions are all true: "v is grey", "v is in room_2", "you are in room_2", "you are in front of v"'""

This means the goal is achieved when I'm in room_2, in front of a grey ball, and the grey ball is in room_2. grey_ball_1 and grey_ball_2 are already in room_2 at the start, so I actually don't need to move anything in order to achieve the goal.

However, there are constraints I need to satisfy:
- Before going to room_2, I must be holding some object.
- At some point, I must be holding grey_ball_1 while green_box_1 is in room_2.

Both of these constraints mean I still need to carry out the plan above.

One more thing to check: Is it really optimal? Let me see if I can reduce the number of steps:

1. gotoobject blue_door_1 room_1
2. gotoobject red_box_1 room_1
3. pick red_box_1 room_1
4. gotoobject red_door_1 room_1
5. toggle red_door_1
6. gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1
7. gotoobject blue_door_2 room_3
8. toggle blue_door_2
9. gotoroom room_3 room_4 blue_door_2
10. gotoobject green_box_1 room_4
11. gotoempty
12. drop red_box_1 room_4
13. gotoobject green_box_1 room_4
14. pick green_box_1 room_4
15. gotoobject purple_door_1 room_4
16. toggle purple_door_1
17. gotoroom room_4 room_2 purple_door_1
18. gotoempty
19. drop green_box_1 room_2
20. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_2
21. pick grey_ball_1 room_2
22. gotoempty
23. drop grey_ball_1 room_2
24. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_2

I think this plan is already close to optimal. I'm satisfying all the constraints while using minimal movements. Let's check if there are any redundant actions:

- I need to go to blue_door_1, pick up red_box_1, and go to room_3 holding it.
- I need to go to room_4 and be in front of green_box_1.
- I need to pick up green_box_1 and go to room_2 holding it.
- I need to drop green_box_1 in room_2 and then pick up grey_ball_1.
- I need to drop grey_ball_1 and go in front of it to achieve the goal.

No, I don't see any redundant actions. The plan is optimal.
