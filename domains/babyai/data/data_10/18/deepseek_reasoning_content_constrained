Okay, let's try to tackle this planning problem step by step. First, I need to understand the initial state, the goal, and all the constraints. Let's start by breaking down each part.

The initial state has the agent in room_1. The doors are all locked. The objects are spread out: red_box_1 and yellow_box_1 are in room_1, grey_balls in room_2 and room_3, and the green_box_1 and some balls are in room_4. The goal is to have a grey ball in room_2, with the agent in room_2 and in front of that ball. So the target is probably grey_ball_1 or grey_ball_2, which are already in room_2. But maybe they need to be moved? Wait, the goal says "there exists a ball v such that v is grey, in room_2, you are in room_2 and in front of v". Since grey_ball_1 and 2 are already in room_2, maybe just getting in front of one of them would work. But the agent starts in room_1. So the plan needs to get the agent to room_2 and in front of a grey ball there.

But there are constraints. Let's list them:

1. At least once be in front of green_box_1 (which is in room_4).
2. Always keep blue_door_1 locked. So we can't unlock it. But blue_door_1 connects room_1 and room_2. Wait, the original state says blue_door_1 is locked, and the constraint is that in every state, blue_door_1 must be locked. So we can never toggle it because that would unlock it, violating the constraint. So the agent can't use blue_door_1 to move between room_1 and room_2. But wait, blue_door_1 is locked initially. If we can't unlock it (since toggling would change its state), then the agent can't use blue_door_1. Therefore, the only way to get to room_2 is through other doors. Wait, the doors between rooms are: blue_door_1 (room_1-room_2), red_door_1 (room_1-room_3), purple_door_1 (room_2-room_4), blue_door_2 (room_3-room_4). So if blue_door_1 is locked and must remain so, then the agent can't go directly from room_1 to room_2. So how to reach room_2? Maybe through room_3 and room_4? Let's see: from room_1, the agent can go to room_3 via red_door_1, but red_door_1 is also locked. Oh, all doors are initially locked. So all doors are locked. So the agent can't move between any rooms unless they unlock the doors. But the constraints include that blue_door_1 must stay locked. So we can't toggle blue_door_1. But other doors can be toggled? Let's check the constraints. The only constraint about doors being locked is the second one: blue_door_1 must be locked in every state. So for other doors, like red_door_1, purple_door_1, blue_door_2, we can toggle them. But the agent needs to unlock them to move through. So the plan must involve unlocking some doors, but making sure that after any toggles, blue_door_1 remains locked.

So first, the agent is in room_1. To leave room_1, since both blue_door_1 (to room_2) and red_door_1 (to room_3) are locked, the agent must unlock one of those doors. But blue_door_1 can't be toggled because that would unlock it, and the constraint says it must always be locked. So the agent can't toggle blue_door_1. Therefore, the only way is to go through red_door_1. So the agent needs to unlock red_door_1. But red_door_1 is in room_1, connecting to room_3. So the agent can go to the door (gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3), then toggle it to unlock. But wait, the preconditions for toggle are that you are in front of the door. So the steps would be: goto the door, toggle it (which unlocks it), then go through to room_3. Then from room_3, perhaps go to room_4 via blue_door_2 (which is locked, so need to toggle it), then from room_4 to room_2 via purple_door_1 (also locked, need to toggle). But need to check the constraints. Also, the plan must include certain actions to meet all the constraints.

Let's look at the constraints again:

1. Must be in front of green_box_1 at least once. Green_box_1 is in room_4. So the agent must go to room_4 and go to that box.

2. Blue_door_1 must remain locked always. So no toggling that door.

3. Must be in front of blue_door_1 at least once. Since blue_door_1 connects room_1 and room_2, and the agent starts in room_1, they can goto that door (if possible). But the door is in room_1, so the agent can goto blue_door_1 in room_1. However, to be in front of blue_door_1, the agent must be in room_1 or room_2. Since they can't go to room_2 via blue_door_1 (it's locked), they can only be in room_1's side. So the agent can do gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2. But the precondition for gotodoor is that you are in a room connected by the door, and there's no object blocking the position in front of d. The initial state has red_box_1 and yellow_box_1 in room_1. Are they blocking the door? The problem statement says that objects may block doors. Wait, the effects of "pick" say that if x was blocking a door, then it's no longer blocking. So in the initial state, are any objects blocking doors? The initial state doesn't mention any objects blocking doors. So perhaps by default, objects are not blocking doors unless stated. So in the initial state, the boxes in room_1 are not blocking the doors. So the agent can go to blue_door_1 in room_1. Then, the constraint that the agent must be in front of blue_door_1 in at least one state is satisfied here. But then, the fourth constraint: if in front of blue_door_1, then the agent must be holding red_box_1 at that state or after. So when the agent is in front of blue_door_1, they need to have red_box_1 either at that moment or later. So the agent could pick up red_box_1 before or after being in front of blue_door_1.

Another constraint is that the agent must hold grey_ball_1 at least once. Since grey_ball_1 is in room_2, the agent needs to get there. But how? If the agent can't use blue_door_1, then they have to take a longer route: room_1 -> room_3 via red_door_1 (unlock it), then room_3 -> room_4 via blue_door_2 (unlock it), then room_4 -> room_2 via purple_door_1 (unlock it). But each of these doors needs to be toggled (unlocked) before moving through.

Additionally, the agent must hold green_box_1 (which is in room_4) at least once. So they need to go to room_4, pick it up, maybe drop it later. Also, the agent must be holding some object while in room_3. And when they are in room_2, there must have been a prior state where they were holding something. Also, there's a constraint that when in room_1, they must later be in room_3. Since they start in room_1, they have to go to room_3 at some point. The plan must include being in room_1 and then later in room_3. The agent starts in room_1, so the first action would involve leaving room_1, which would require unlocking red_door_1.

Another constraint is that purple_door_1 must be unlocked at least once. Since it starts locked, the agent must toggle it to unlock it. So during the plan, the agent must toggle purple_door_1 to unlock it.

So putting all this together, here's a possible sequence:

1. Agent is in room_1. They need to unlock red_door_1 to go to room_3.

So first, goto red_door_1 in room_1: gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3.

Then toggle it to unlock. Now red_door_1 is unlocked.

Then gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1. Now in room_3.

But there's a constraint that the agent must be in room_3 while holding some object. So perhaps later, after picking up something, the agent comes back to room_3. Or maybe after moving to room_3, go to room_4.

In room_3, there's grey_ball_3. So maybe pick it up, but that's not necessary for the goal. The goal is about a grey ball in room_2. But maybe the agent needs to pick up grey_ball_1 or 2 in room_2. Wait, the goal is to have a grey ball in room_2 (they are already there) and be in front of it. So perhaps just go to room_2 and goto the ball. But the agent can't go directly from room_1 to room_2 via blue_door_1 (locked and must stay locked). So the path must be room_1 -> room_3 -> room_4 -> room_2.

But let's outline the steps:

1. In room_1, go to red_door_1 (gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3). Then toggle to unlock. Then go to room_3.

2. In room_3, go to blue_door_2 (gotodoor blue_door_2 room_3 room_4). Toggle to unlock. Then go to room_4.

3. In room_4, there's green_box_1. Need to be in front of it (constraint 1). So gotoobject green_box_1 room_4. Then pick it up (to satisfy constraint 6: hold green_box_1 at least once). Then drop it somewhere, maybe in room_2 later.

But also, the agent must be in room_3 while holding some object. So after moving to room_4, perhaps the agent can return to room_3 with the green_box_1. But that might complicate things. Alternatively, after picking up green_box_1 in room_4, then go back to room_3, but that requires going through blue_door_2 again (which is now unlocked). Hmm.

But let's proceed step by step.

After entering room_4, the agent can go to the green_box_1, pick it up. Then, maybe go to purple_door_1 (connecting room_2 and room_4). To go to room_2 from room_4, need to go through purple_door_1, which is locked. So agent needs to toggle it. But first, must be in front of it. So in room_4, gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_2. Then toggle to unlock (satisfying the constraint that purple_door_1 is unlocked at least once). Then gotoroom room_4 room_2 purple_door_1. Now in room_2.

But when entering room_2, the agent must have held an object before. So before arriving in room_2, the agent must have picked something up. In this case, the agent is holding green_box_1 when moving to room_2. So that satisfies the constraint that when in room_2, there was a prior state holding something.

Once in room_2, the agent needs to be in front of a grey ball (grey_ball_1 or 2). So drop the green_box_1 (maybe in room_2, which would place it there, satisfying the constraint that in some state, "you are holding grey_ball_1" and "green_box_1 is in room_2". Wait, the constraint says: "The following conditions are all true: you are holding grey_ball_1, green_box_1 is in room_2". So the agent needs to have both conditions true in the same state. So maybe after dropping green_box_1 in room_2, then pick up grey_ball_1. But that requires being in room_2, dropping green_box_1, then going to grey_ball_1 (which is in room_2), picking it up. But the agent is holding green_box_1 when entering room_2, so when they drop it, green_box_1 is now in room_2. Then the agent can pick up grey_ball_1. That way, there's a state where the agent is holding grey_ball_1 and green_box_1 is in room_2. Also, the agent must hold grey_ball_1 at least once (constraint 5).

But let's see the steps:

In room_2 after entering from room_4 via purple_door_1. The agent is holding green_box_1. They need to drop it in room_2. To drop, they need to be in front of an empty position. So first, gotoempty in room_2. Then drop green_box_1. Now green_box_1 is in room_2. Then, gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_2. Then pick it up. Now, the agent is holding grey_ball_1. Then, they can drop it again (but the goal requires being in front of a grey ball in room_2). Wait, the goal is that the agent is in room_2, in front of a grey ball. So after dropping grey_ball_1, they are in front of it. But wait, when you drop an object, you are in front of it. So if the agent picks up grey_ball_1 and then drops it, they would be in front of it. But the goal requires that the final state has the agent in front of a grey ball in room_2. So perhaps the final action is to drop grey_ball_1, but that would leave the agent in front of it. Alternatively, after picking it up, just being in front of it (but then the agent is holding it, which doesn't meet the goal). Wait, the goal doesn't specify that the agent isn't holding the ball. The goal says "you are in front of v". So if the agent is holding v (grey_ball_1), but not in front of it. So to be in front of v, the agent must drop it. So the plan would end with dropping grey_ball_1 in room_2, which puts the agent in front of it.

But let's check all constraints again. The plan must also ensure that when in room_1, the agent later goes to room_3. Since the agent starts in room_1, and then moves to room_3, that's satisfied.

Also, the constraint that the agent must be in front of blue_door_1 at least once. Since blue_door_1 is in room_1 and room_2. The agent starts in room_1. So before leaving room_1, the agent can go to blue_door_1. But the agent needs to unlock red_door_1 first. Wait, no: the agent can first goto blue_door_1, then toggle it. But wait, no. Because blue_door_1 is locked, and the constraint says it must stay locked. So if the agent is in front of blue_door_1, they can't toggle it because that would unlock it. Wait, the toggle action toggles the state. If the door is locked, toggle unlocks it. But since blue_door_1 must always be locked, we can't toggle it. Therefore, the agent can go in front of blue_door_1 (without toggling it) as long as they meet the preconditions. So the agent can, while in room_1, perform gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2. Then, since they are in front of blue_door_1, that satisfies constraint 3. Then, according to constraint 4, they must be holding red_box_1 either at that state or after. So the agent can pick up red_box_1 before or after this.

So integrating that into the plan:

Before leaving room_1:

1. gotoobject red_box_1 room_1 (precondition: in room_1, which they are). Then pick it up (now holding red_box_1). Then go to blue_door_1 (gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2). Now in front of blue_door_1, which satisfies constraint 3. And since they are holding red_box_1, constraint 4 is satisfied. Then drop red_box_1 (needs to be in front of empty spot). So gotoempty, drop red_box_1. Then proceed to unlock red_door_1 and go to room_3.

But this adds steps. Let's see if this works.

Alternative approach:

Start in room_1.

1. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2. Now in front of blue_door_1. Constraint 3 is met. But at this state, the agent isn't holding red_box_1. So constraint 4 requires that in this state or after, the agent holds red_box_1. So after this, the agent must pick up red_box_1 at some point.

Then, the agent can proceed to pick up red_box_1.

So steps:

1. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2. (satisfies constraint 3)
2. gotoobject red_box_1 room_1. (since you are in room_1)
3. pick red_box_1 room_1. (now holding it, satisfies constraint 4's requirement)
4. Then proceed to unlock red_door_1 and go to room_3.

But this adds more steps. Let's see if this can fit into the overall plan.

Now, considering all constraints, perhaps the optimal plan would be:

- Start in room_1.
- Go to blue_door_1 to satisfy constraint 3.
- Pick up red_box_1 to satisfy constraint 4.
- Then unlock red_door_1 and move to room_3.
- Proceed to room_3, unlock blue_door_2 to go to room_4.
- In room_4, pick up green_box_1 (constraint 6), and go to purple_door_1, unlock it (satisfies constraint about purple_door_1 being unlocked), go to room_2.
- Drop green_box_1 in room_2, then pick up grey_ball_1 (constraint 5 and the combined constraint of holding it and green_box_1 in room_2).
- Drop grey_ball_1 to be in front of it in room_2 (goal).

But let's check all steps and constraints.

Let's outline the steps:

1. In room_1:
   a. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2 → satisfy constraint 3.
   b. Now in front of blue_door_1. Need to ensure that the agent holds red_box_1 at or after this state. So next steps should involve picking up red_box_1.
   c. gotoobject red_box_1 room_1.
   d. pick red_box_1 room_1. Now holding it.
   e. Then need to drop it somewhere? Or carry it. But carrying it might complicate moving through doors, but possible.
   f. Then unlock red_door_1: gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3.
   g. toggle red_door_1 → unlocks it.
   h. gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1 → now in room_3.

2. In room_3:
   a. Need to unlock blue_door_2 to go to room_4.
   b. gotodoor blue_door_2 room_3 room_4.
   c. toggle blue_door_2 → unlocks.
   d. gotoroom room_3 room_4 blue_door_2 → now in room_4.

3. In room_4:
   a. gotoobject green_box_1 room_4 → satisfy constraint 1.
   b. pick green_box_1 room_4 → satisfy constraint 6.
   c. Now holding green_box_1. Need to go to room_2 via purple_door_1.
   d. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_2.
   e. toggle purple_door_1 → unlocks (satisfies constraint 12).
   f. gotoroom room_4 room_2 purple_door_1 → now in room_2. Before arriving, the agent was holding green_box_1, which satisfies the constraint that when entering room_2, the agent had held something earlier.

4. In room_2:
   a. Now holding green_box_1. Need to drop it.
   b. gotoempty room_2.
   c. drop green_box_1 room_2 → now green_box_1 is in room_2.
   d. Now, need to pick up grey_ball_1. Gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_2.
   e. pick grey_ball_1 room_2 → satisfies constraint 5.
   f. Now, to be in front of it, perhaps drop it. But dropping it would place it in room_2 and the agent in front of it. So:
   g. gotoempty room_2.
   h. drop grey_ball_1 room_2. Now, the agent is in front of grey_ball_1 in room_2. But the goal is to be in front of a grey ball in room_2. So this satisfies the goal.

But wait, after step 4e, the agent is holding grey_ball_1. If they drop it, they are in front of it. So steps could be:

After picking grey_ball_1, drop it in room_2. Then, the agent is in front of it. So the final state is in room_2, in front of grey_ball_1, which is grey and in room_2. So goal achieved.

Also, check other constraints:

- Must be in room_1 at least once. The agent starts there, so satisfied.
- If in room_1, must later be in room_3. Yes, after leaving room_1 to room_3.
- Must be in room_2 at least once. Yes.
- Must hold some object in room_3. Wait, the agent went through room_3 but didn't hold anything there. So this is a problem. The constraint says: "The following expression must hold in at least one state: "The following conditions are all true: "you are holding some object", "you are in room_3". So the agent must be holding an object while in room_3. But in the current plan, when the agent is in room_3, they are not holding anything. Because they dropped red_box_1 before leaving room_1, or are they holding red_box_1 when moving to room_3?

Wait, in step 1d, after picking up red_box_1, the agent is holding it. Then they unlock red_door_1 (step 1f and g), then move to room_3 (step 1h). So when in room_3, the agent is holding red_box_1. So that satisfies the constraint of holding an object in room_3. But then, in room_3, the agent needs to unlock blue_door_2. So steps in room_3:

In room_3, holding red_box_1. Need to unlock blue_door_2. So:

a. gotodoor blue_door_2 room_3 room_4 → requires being in room_3 and the door connects to room_4. Then toggle to unlock. Then gotoroom to room_4. But while holding red_box_1. Then in room_4, the agent can drop red_box_1 if needed, but perhaps not necessary.

But the agent needs to pick up green_box_1 in room_4, which requires not holding anything. So after arriving in room_4, the agent is holding red_box_1. To pick up green_box_1, they must drop red_box_1 first. Or drop it somewhere else.

So let's adjust the plan:

After entering room_3 while holding red_box_1:

3a. gotodoor blue_door_2 room_3 room_4.

3b. toggle blue_door_2 → unlocks it.

3c. gotoroom room_3 room_4 blue_door_2 → now in room_4, holding red_box_1.

3d. gotoempty room_4.

3e. drop red_box_1 room_4.

3f. Now, gotoobject green_box_1 room_4.

3g. pick green_box_1 room_4.

3h. Then proceed to purple_door_1.

This way, when in room_3, the agent was holding red_box_1, which satisfies the constraint of holding an object in room_3.

But this adds more steps. Let's see:

So revised steps:

1. In room_1:
   a. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2 (front of blue_door_1)
   b. gotoobject red_box_1 room_1
   c. pick red_box_1 room_1 (now holding it)
   d. gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3
   e. toggle red_door_1 (unlocks)
   f. gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1 → now in room_3, holding red_box_1

2. In room_3:
   a. gotodoor blue_door_2 room_3 room_4
   b. toggle blue_door_2 → unlocks
   c. gotoroom room_3 room_4 blue_door_2 → now in room_4, holding red_box_1

3. In room_4:
   a. gotoempty room_4
   b. drop red_box_1 room_4
   c. gotoobject green_box_1 room_4
   d. pick green_box_1 room_4 (now holding green_box_1)
   e. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_2
   f. toggle purple_door_1 → unlocks
   g. gotoroom room_4 room_2 purple_door_1 → now in room_2, holding green_box_1

4. In room_2:
   a. gotoempty room_2
   b. drop green_box_1 room_2 (now green_box_1 is in room_2)
   c. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_2
   d. pick grey_ball_1 room_2
   e. gotoempty room_2
   f. drop grey_ball_1 room_2 → now in front of it, satisfying the goal.

But wait, after step 4d, the agent is holding grey_ball_1. Then they need to drop it to be in front. So steps 4d-f:

Pick grey_ball_1 (now holding it), then gotoempty (maybe not necessary? Because after dropping, you are in front of the object. So after picking, they are no longer in front of it. So they need to gotoempty, then drop. So steps:

4c. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_2 → in front of it.

4d. pick grey_ball_1 room_2 → now holding it, not in front.

4e. gotoempty room_2.

4f. drop grey_ball_1 room_2 → now in front of it.

This way, the agent is in front of grey_ball_1 in room_2, satisfying the goal.

Additionally, the constraint that "you are holding grey_ball_1" is satisfied (step 4d), and "green_box_1 is in room_2" is true after step 4b. So in step 4d, when the agent is holding grey_ball_1, green_box_1 is already in room_2. So the combined constraint is satisfied.

Other constraints:

- Purple_door_1 is unlocked (step 3f).
- Be in room_2 (step 3g).
- Be in room_1 (initial state) and then room_3.
- The agent must be in front of blue_door_1 (step 1a).
- The agent must hold green_box_1 (step 3d).
- The agent must hold something in room_3 (step 2, in room_3, holding red_box_1).
- When in room_2, had previously held something (green_box_1 when entering room_2).

Now, checking all constraints:

1. In front of green_box_1: step 3c (when picked up) → yes.

2. Blue_door_1 remains locked always: yes, never toggled.

3. In front of blue_door_1: step 1a.

4. When in front of blue_door_1, hold red_box_1 at or after: step 1c happens after, so yes.

5. Hold grey_ball_1: step 4d.

6. Hold green_box_1: step 3d.

7. Hold some object in room_3: step 2 (agent is in room_3 holding red_box_1).

8. Be in room_2: step 3g.

9. When in room_2, held something before: yes, green_box_1 when entering.

10. Hold grey_ball_1 and green_box_1 in room_2: after step 4b, green_box_1 is in room_2. When agent picks grey_ball_1 in step 4d, they are holding it while green_box_1 is in room_2. So yes.

11. Be in room_1: initial state.

12. If in room_1, then later in room_3: yes.

13. Purple_door_1 unlocked: step 3f.

This seems to satisfy all constraints. Now, checking if the plan is optimal (shortest possible). Are there any redundant steps?

For example, after picking up green_box_1 in room_4, the agent goes to room_2. But they could drop green_box_1 in room_2 and then pick up a grey ball. But that's necessary to meet the constraint where holding grey_ball_1 and green_box_1 is in room_2.

Alternatively, could the agent carry green_box_1 to room_2, drop it, then pick up grey_ball_1. That seems necessary.

Another possible optimization: after dropping green_box_1 in room_2, instead of picking up grey_ball_1, just goto it and be in front. But the goal requires the agent to be in front of a grey ball in room_2. If grey_ball_1 is already there, the agent could just gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_2. But why pick it up? Because the agent needs to hold it at least once (constraint 5). So yes, they must pick it up.

But then, after picking it up, the agent is not in front of it. So they have to drop it again to be in front. Or perhaps just goto it and be in front. But if they are already in front of it without picking up, then the goal is satisfied. But the agent must hold it at least once. So the steps would be:

In room_2:

a. Goto grey_ball_1.

b. Pick it up (now holding it, satisfies constraint 5).

c. Drop it (now in front of it).

But the goal is satisfied after step c. So this is necessary.

So the steps are necessary.

Alternative plan steps count:

1. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2

2. gotoobject red_box_1 room_1

3. pick red_box_1 room_1

4. gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3

5. toggle red_door_1

6. gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1

7. gotodoor blue_door_2 room_3 room_4

8. toggle blue_door_2

9. gotoroom room_3 room_4 blue_door_2

10. gotoempty room_4

11. drop red_box_1 room_4

12. gotoobject green_box_1 room_4

13. pick green_box_1 room_4

14. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_2

15. toggle purple_door_1

16. gotoroom room_4 room_2 purple_door_1

17. gotoempty room_2

18. drop green_box_1 room_2

19. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_2

20. pick grey_ball_1 room_2

21. gotoempty room_2

22. drop grey_ball_1 room_2

That's 22 actions. Can this be optimized?

Wait, after step 1 (goto blue_door_1), the agent is in front of it. Then steps 2-3 to pick up red_box_1. Then steps 4-6 to go to room_3. Then steps 7-9 to room_4. Steps 10-11 to drop red_box_1. Steps 12-13 to pick green_box_1. Steps 14-16 to room_2. Steps 17-18 to drop green_box_1. Steps 19-22 to handle grey_ball_1.

Is there a way to shorten this? For example, can the agent carry red_box_1 to room_4 and drop it there, then pick up green_box_1. But that's what's happening. Alternatively, can the agent drop red_box_1 in room_3 instead of room_4? But in room_3, there's no object blocking, so possible. Then:

After step 6, in room_3, holding red_box_1. Then steps:

7. gotoempty room_3.

8. drop red_box_1 room_3.

9. gotodoor blue_door_2 room_3 room_4.

10. toggle blue_door_2.

11. gotoroom room_3 room_4 blue_door_2.

Then proceed to pick green_box_1. This would save steps 10-11 in room_4. But then, when in room_3, the agent is holding red_box_1 (step 6), then drops it (step 8), which means when the agent is in room_3, they were holding red_box_1 (step 6-8). That still satisfies the constraint of holding an object in room_3. This way, in room_4, the agent doesn't need to drop red_box_1. So steps saved:

Original steps after entering room_4 (steps 10-11):

10. gotoempty room_4

11. drop red_box_1 room_4

But if instead, drop in room_3:

7. gotoempty room_3

8. drop red_box_1 room_3

Then steps saved: two steps (10-11 become unnecessary). So total steps would be 20 instead of 22.

Let's revise:

1. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2

2. gotoobject red_box_1 room_1

3. pick red_box_1 room_1

4. gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3

5. toggle red_door_1

6. gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1 (holding red_box_1)

7. gotoempty room_3

8. drop red_box_1 room_3

9. gotodoor blue_door_2 room_3 room_4

10. toggle blue_door_2

11. gotoroom room_3 room_4 blue_door_2

12. gotoobject green_box_1 room_4

13. pick green_box_1 room_4

14. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_2

15. toggle purple_door_1

16. gotoroom room_4 room_2 purple_door_1

17. gotoempty room_2

18. drop green_box_1 room_2

19. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_2

20. pick grey_ball_1 room_2

21. gotoempty room_2

22. drop grey_ball_1 room_2

Wait, this is still 22 steps. Because dropping in room_3 adds steps 7 and 8. So no savings. Maybe there's no optimization here.

Alternatively, after picking up red_box_1 in room_1, instead of carrying it to room_3, can the agent drop it somewhere else earlier? But the agent needs to hold it after being in front of blue_door_1. So steps 1-3 are necessary.

Another optimization: after picking up green_box_1 in room_4, the agent can go directly to purple_door_1 without going to empty first. But to drop green_box_1 in room_2, they need to be in front of an empty spot.

Alternatively, when arriving in room_2 with green_box_1, they can drop it immediately upon arrival. Because after gotoroom, the agent is no longer in front of any object. So upon arriving in room_2, they can drop green_box_1 anywhere. Wait, the drop action requires being in front of an empty position. So after arriving in room_2 via purple_door_1, the agent is not in front of any object. So they can drop green_box_1 immediately:

After step 16 (gotoroom room_4 room_2 purple_door_1), the agent is in room_2, not in front of anything. So they can:

17. drop green_box_1 room_2 (but need to be in front of empty position. So they need to gotoempty first.

But wait, after entering a room via gotoroom, you are no longer in front of any object. So you can't drop immediately unless you are in front of an empty spot. But the agent is in room_2, not in front of any object. So they need to gotoempty to drop. So steps 17-18 are needed.

Another possible optimization: after picking up grey_ball_1, instead of dropping it, can the agent just be in front of it? For example:

19. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_2 → in front of it.

But the agent is not holding it. So the goal is satisfied. But the constraint requires holding grey_ball_1 at least once. So the agent must pick it up, then drop it to be in front. So steps 19-22 are necessary.

Thus, the plan length is 22 steps. Is there a shorter way?

Alternative approach: Use grey_ball_2 instead of grey_ball_1. But the steps would be similar.

Another idea: Can the agent pick up grey_ball_1 in room_2 without moving green_box_1 there? For example, if the agent goes to room_2 via a different path, but given the constraints, the path must go through room_4.

Alternatively, can the agent carry green_box_1 to room_2 and drop it there, then pick up grey_ball_1. That's what's happening.

Is there a way to avoid carrying green_box_1 all the way? The constraint requires that the agent holds green_box_1 at least once. So they must pick it up. Then they can drop it anywhere, but another constraint requires that in some state, the agent is holding grey_ball_1 and green_box_1 is in room_2. So green_box_1 must be in room_2, which requires dropping it there.

Thus, the steps are necessary.

Therefore, the plan outlined seems to meet all constraints and is optimal in length.
