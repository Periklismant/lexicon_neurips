Let me analyze this planning problem step by step.

First, I'll summarize the initial state:
- I am in room_1
- green_ball_1, purple_box_1, and red_box_1 are in room_2
- yellow_box_1 and blue_ball_1 are in room_3
- green_ball_2, grey_box_1, and purple_box_2 are in room_4
- All doors (red_door_1, yellow_door_1, blue_door_1, grey_door_1) are locked
- I am not holding any object

The goal is:
- There is a green ball in room_2
- I am in room_2
- I am in front of that green ball

Let's identify the constraints:
1. I must hold some object at some point
2. red_door_1 must be unlocked at some point
3. Before red_door_1 is unlocked, either grey_box_1 must be in room_2 or I must be holding green_ball_1
4. red_door_1 must be locked at some point
5. When red_door_1 is locked, I must be holding some object at that point or later
6. I must be in front of purple_box_2 at some point
7. I must either be in front of blue_door_1 or holding grey_box_1 at some point
8. I must be in room_2 at some point
9. Before being in room_2, I must either be holding some object or grey_door_1 must be unlocked
10. I must be in room_1 at some point
11. When in room_1, I must be holding blue_ball_1 or some object at that point or later
12. I must either be in front of purple_box_1 or holding some object at some point
13. green_ball_1 must be in room_4 at some point
14. I must be holding red_box_1 or some object at some point

Now let's think about the plan:

Given that my goal involves green_ball_1 (which is initially in room_2), and I need to be in room_2 with it, I'll need to navigate between rooms.

To satisfy constraint 13 (green_ball_1 must be in room_4 at some point), I must move green_ball_1 from room_2 to room_4 at some point.

To move between rooms, I need to unlock doors. All doors are initially locked, so I'll need to use the toggle action on doors.

Let me explore the possible paths to achieve the goal while satisfying the constraints:

Starting in room_1, I have two possible doors to navigate through:
- red_door_1 to room_2
- yellow_door_1 to room_3

Let's try to form a plan:

1. I need to get to room_2 eventually to meet constraint 8 and to achieve my goal
2. To get to room_2, I need to unlock red_door_1 (constraint 2)
3. Before I unlock red_door_1, I need to either have grey_box_1 in room_2 or be holding green_ball_1 (constraint 3)
4. grey_box_1 is initially in room_4, and green_ball_1 is in room_2
5. To get green_ball_1, I need to get to room_2 first, but I need to unlock red_door_1 to do that
6. To move grey_box_1 to room_2, I need to get to room_4 first, pick up grey_box_1, and bring it to room_2

Let's try to go to room_3 first (via yellow_door_1), then to room_4 (via grey_door_1), pick up grey_box_1, go back to room_2 (via blue_door_1), and then unlock red_door_1.

But there's a circular dependency because I need to satisfy constraint 9: before being in room_2, I must either be holding some object or grey_door_1 must be unlocked. And to unlock grey_door_1, I need to get to it first.

Let me rethink this. Constraint 9 says that before being in room_2, I must either be holding some object or grey_door_1 must be unlocked. So I could pick up an object in room_1 before going to room_2. But there are no objects in room_1 initially.

Let me revise my approach:

1. I am in room_1
2. I need to unlock yellow_door_1 to get to room_3
3. From room_3, I can unlock grey_door_1 to get to room_4
4. In room_4, I can pick up grey_box_1
5. From room_4, I can unlock blue_door_1 to get to room_2
6. I can drop grey_box_1 in room_2, satisfying constraint 3
7. I can then unlock red_door_1 (which satisfies constraint 2)
8. I can pick up green_ball_1 from room_2
9. I need to move green_ball_1 to room_4 at some point (constraint 13)
10. Later I need to bring green_ball_1 back to room_2 and stand in front of it to complete the goal

Now let's implement this plan in detail with the available actions:

1. Starting in room_1, I will go to the yellow_door_1 to unlock it:
   - gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3
   - toggle yellow_door_1

2. Now I'll go to room_3:
   - gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1

3. In room_3, I'll go to grey_door_1 to unlock it:
   - gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4
   - toggle grey_door_1

4. I'll go to room_4:
   - gotoroom room_3 room_4 grey_door_1

5. In room_4, I need to pick up grey_box_1:
   - gotoobject grey_box_1 room_4
   - pick grey_box_1 room_4

6. I'll also need to stand in front of purple_box_2 at some point (constraint 6):
   - gotoobject purple_box_2 room_4

7. Now I'll go back to room_3:
   - gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3
   - gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1

8. From room_3, I need to pick up blue_ball_1 to satisfy constraint 11:
   - gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_3
   - pick blue_ball_1 room_3
   - Oh wait, I can't pick up blue_ball_1 because I'm already holding grey_box_1...

Let me rethink this. Constraint 11 says that when in room_1, I must be holding blue_ball_1 or some object. Since I'll be holding grey_box_1, that satisfies the constraint.

Now let's continue:

8. I'll go back to room_1:
   - gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1
   - gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_1

9. Now I'm back in room_1 holding grey_box_1, which satisfies constraint 11

10. I'll go to red_door_1 to unlock it:
    - gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_2
    - toggle red_door_1

11. Now I'll go to room_2:
    - gotoroom room_1 room_2 red_door_1

12. I'm in room_2 holding grey_box_1, which satisfies constraint 9

13. I'll go in front of purple_box_1 to satisfy constraint 12:
    - gotoobject purple_box_1 room_2

14. I'll drop grey_box_1 in room_2, which ensures that both grey_box_1 is in room_2 and I was holding an object:
    - gotoempty
    - drop grey_box_1 room_2

15. Now I'll go to blue_door_1 to unlock it and satisfy constraint 7:
    - gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_4
    - toggle blue_door_1

16. I'll go to room_4:
    - gotoroom room_2 room_4 blue_door_1

17. In room_4, I need to pick up green_ball_2:
    - gotoobject green_ball_2 room_4
    - pick green_ball_2 room_4

18. I'll go back to room_2:
    - gotodoor blue_door_1 room_4 room_2
    - gotoroom room_4 room_2 blue_door_1

19. I'll drop green_ball_2 in room_2:
    - gotoempty
    - drop green_ball_2 room_2

20. Now I'll pick up green_ball_1 in room_2:
    - gotoobject green_ball_1 room_2
    - pick green_ball_1 room_2

21. I need to move green_ball_1 to room_4 (constraint 13), so I'll go to room_4:
    - gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_4
    - gotoroom room_2 room_4 blue_door_1

22. I'll drop green_ball_1 in room_4:
    - gotoempty
    - drop green_ball_1 room_4

23. Now I need to unlock red_door_1 again, but to do that I need to go back to room_2, go to room_1, and then to red_door_1:
    - gotodoor blue_door_1 room_4 room_2
    - gotoroom room_4 room_2 blue_door_1
    - gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_1
    - gotoroom room_2 room_1 red_door_1
    - gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_2
    - toggle red_door_1

Hmm, but constraint 4 says that red_door_1 must be locked at some point, and constraint 5 says that when red_door_1 is locked, I must be holding some object. So I need to somehow lock red_door_1 again while I'm holding an object.

Let me revise this part of the plan:

23. In room_4, I'll pick up red_box_1 to satisfy constraint 14:
    - Wait, red_box_1 is in room_2, not room_4. I need to go back to room_2 first.
    - gotodoor blue_door_1 room_4 room_2
    - gotoroom room_4 room_2 blue_door_1
    - gotoobject red_box_1 room_2
    - pick red_box_1 room_2

24. Now I'll go to room_1 to lock red_door_1 again:
    - gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_1
    - gotoroom room_2 room_1 red_door_1
    - gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_2
    - toggle red_door_1 (making it locked now)

25. At this point, I'm holding red_box_1 and red_door_1 is locked, which satisfies constraint 5

26. I'll unlock red_door_1 again:
    - toggle red_door_1

27. I'll go back to room_2:
    - gotoroom room_1 room_2 red_door_1

28. I'll drop red_box_1:
    - gotoempty
    - drop red_box_1 room_2

29. I'll pick up green_ball_1 again (which is now in room_4, so I need to go there first):
    - gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_4
    - gotoroom room_2 room_4 blue_door_1
    - gotoobject green_ball_1 room_4
    - pick green_ball_1 room_4

30. I'll go back to room_2:
    - gotodoor blue_door_1 room_4 room_2
    - gotoroom room_4 room_2 blue_door_1

31. I'll drop green_ball_1 in room_2:
    - gotoempty
    - drop green_ball_1 room_2

32. Finally, I'll go in front of green_ball_1 to complete the goal:
    - gotoobject green_ball_1 room_2

Let me check if the plan satisfies all constraints:

1. I hold objects multiple times in the plan, satisfying constraint 1
2. red_door_1 is unlocked at steps 10 and 26, satisfying constraint 2
3. Before red_door_1 is unlocked (step 10), I'm holding grey_box_1, which satisfies constraint 3
4. red_door_1 is locked at step 24, satisfying constraint 4
5. When red_door_1 is locked (step 24), I'm holding red_box_1, which satisfies constraint 5
6. I stand in front of purple_box_2 at step 6, satisfying constraint 6
7. I go in front of blue_door_1 at step 15, satisfying constraint 7
8. I am in room_2 at multiple points, satisfying constraint 8
9. Before being in room_2 (step 11), I am holding grey_box_1, which satisfies constraint 9
10. I am in room_1 at the start and also return to it, satisfying constraint 10
11. When in room_1, I am holding objects at multiple points, satisfying constraint 11
12. I go in front of purple_box_1 at step 13, satisfying constraint 12
13. green_ball_1 is in room_4 at step 22, satisfying constraint 13
14. I am holding red_box_1 at step 23, satisfying constraint 14

Let me review the plan once more to make sure it's correct:

Wait, I just noticed some inconsistencies in my plan. Let me revise it:

17. In room_4, I need to pick up green_ball_2:
    - gotoobject green_ball_2 room_4
    - pick green_ball_2 room_4

I'm not sure why I decided to pick up green_ball_2. Let me get back to my original plan and refine it:

1. Start in room_1
2. Unlock yellow_door_1 and go to room_3
3. Unlock grey_door_1 and go to room_4
4. In room_4, stand in front of purple_box_2 (constraint 6)
5. In room_4, pick up grey_box_1
6. Go back to room_3, then to room_1
7. Go to red_door_1, unlock it, and go to room_2
8. In room_2, go in front of purple_box_1 (constraint 12)
9. Drop grey_box_1 in room_2
10. Go to blue_door_1, unlock it (constraint 7), and go to room_4
11. In room_4, pick up green_ball_1 (which isn't there yet)...

Wait, I'm making a mistake here. Let me carefully review the initial setup again.

Initial state:
- green_ball_1 is in room_2 (not room_4)
- We need to move green_ball_1 to room_4 at some point

Let me revise my plan:

1. Start in room_1
2. Unlock yellow_door_1 and go to room_3
3. Unlock grey_door_1 and go to room_4
4. In room_4, stand in front of purple_box_2 (constraint 6)
5. In room_4, pick up grey_box_1
6. Go back to room_3, then to room_1
7. Unlock red_door_1 and go to room_2
8. In room_2, go in front of purple_box_1 (constraint 12)
9. Drop grey_box_1 in room_2
10. Pick up green_ball_1 from room_2
11. Go to blue_door_1, unlock it (constraint 7)
12. Go to room_4 and drop green_ball_1 there (constraint 13)
13. Pick up red_box_1 (constraint 14)
14. Go back to room_1 and lock red_door_1 (constraint 4) while holding red_box_1 (constraint 5)
15. Unlock red_door_1 again and go to room_2
16. Drop red_box_1 in room_2
17. Go to room_4, pick up green_ball_1
18. Go back to room_2, drop green_ball_1
19. Go in front of green_ball_1 to complete the goal

Let me write the exact sequences of actions for this plan:

```
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3
toggle yellow_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4
toggle grey_door_1
gotoroom room_3 room_4 grey_door_1
gotoobject purple_box_2 room_4
gotoobject grey_box_1 room_4
pick grey_box_1 room_4
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3
gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1
gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_1
gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_2
toggle red_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_2 red_door_1
gotoobject purple_box_1 room_2
gotoempty
drop grey_box_1 room_2
gotoobject green_ball_1 room_2
pick green_ball_1 room_2
gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_4
toggle blue_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_4 blue_door_1
gotoempty
drop green_ball_1 room_4
gotoobject red_box_1 room_2
```

But I made another mistake! red_box_1 is in room_2, not room_4. I need to go back to room_2 to pick it up. Let me revise:

```
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3
toggle yellow_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4
toggle grey_door_1
gotoroom room_3 room_4 grey_door_1
gotoobject purple_box_2 room_4
gotoobject grey_box_1 room_4
pick grey_box_1 room_4
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3
gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1
gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_1
gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_2
toggle red_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_2 red_door_1
gotoobject purple_box_1 room_2
gotoempty
drop grey_box_1 room_2
gotoobject green_ball_1 room_2
pick green_ball_1 room_2
gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_4
toggle blue_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_4 blue_door_1
gotoempty
drop green_ball_1 room_4
gotodoor blue_door_1 room_4 room_2
gotoroom room_4 room_2 blue_door_1
gotoobject red_box_1 room_2
pick red_box_1 room_2
gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_1
gotoroom room_2 room_1 red_door_1
gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_2
toggle red_door_1
toggle red_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_2 red_door_1
gotoempty
drop red_box_1 room_2
gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_4
gotoroom room_2 room_4 blue_door_1
gotoobject green_ball_1 room_4
pick green_ball_1 room_4
gotodoor blue_door_1 room_4 room_2
gotoroom room_4 room_2 blue_door_1
gotoempty
drop green_ball_1 room_2
gotoobject green_ball_1 room_2
```

Now let me check again if all constraints are satisfied:

1. ✓ I hold objects multiple times in the plan
2. ✓ red_door_1 is unlocked at step 15 and again later
3. ✓ Before red_door_1 is unlocked (step 15), I'm holding grey_box_1
4. ✓ red_door_1 is locked when I toggle it after going to room_1
5. ✓ When red_door_1 is locked, I'm holding red_box_1
6. ✓ I stand in front of purple_box_2 in room_4
7. ✓ I go in front of blue_door_1 to unlock it
8. ✓ I am in room_2 multiple times
9. ✓ Before being in room_2, I am holding grey_box_1
10. ✓ I am in room_1 at the start and return to it
11. ✓ When in room_1, I am holding objects
12. ✓ I go in front of purple_box_1 in room_2
13. ✓ green_ball_1 is in room_4 after I drop it there
14. ✓ I am holding red_box_1 at one point

I think all constraints are satisfied. Let me review the plan once more to make sure it's optimal and correct:

1. From room_1, I unlock yellow_door_1 and go to room_3
2. From room_3, I unlock grey_door_1 and go to room_4
3. In room_4, I go in front of purple_box_2 and then pick up grey_box_1
4. I return to room_1 via room_3
5. I unlock red_door_1 and go to room_2
6. In room_2, I go in front of purple_box_1 and then drop grey_box_1
7. I pick up green_ball_1
8. I unlock blue_door_1 and go to room_4
9. I drop green_ball_1 in room_4
10. I return to room_2 and pick up red_box_1
11. I go to room_1 and lock red_door_1
12. I unlock red_door_1 again and go to room_2
13. I drop red_box_1
14. I go to room_4, pick up green_ball_1, and bring it back to room_2
15. I drop green_ball_1 and go in front of it to complete the goal

The plan seems optimal and satisfies all constraints. Here's the final sequence of actions:

```
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3
toggle yellow_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4
toggle grey_door_1
gotoroom room_3 room_4 grey_door_1
gotoobject purple_box_2 room_4
gotoobject grey_box_1 room_4
pick grey_box_1 room_4
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3
gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1
gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_1
gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_2
toggle red_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_2 red_door_1
gotoobject purple_box_1 room_2
gotoempty
drop grey_box_1 room_2
gotoobject green_ball_1 room_2
pick green_ball_1 room_2
gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_4
toggle blue_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_4 blue_door_1
gotoempty
drop green_ball_1 room_4
gotodoor blue_door_1 room_4 room_2
gotoroom room_4 room_2 blue_door_1
gotoobject red_box_1 room_2
pick red_box_1 room_2
gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_1
gotoroom room_2 room_1 red_door_1
gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_2
toggle red_door_1
toggle red_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_2 red_door_1
gotoempty
drop red_box_1 room_2
gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_4
gotoroom room_2 room_4 blue_door_1
gotoobject green_ball_1 room_4
pick green_ball_1 room_4
gotodoor blue_door_1 room_4 room_2
gotoroom room_4 room_2 blue_door_1
gotoempty
drop green_ball_1 room_2
gotoobject green_ball_1 room_2
```

This plan should achieve the goal while satisfying all the constraints. Let me double-check it one more time:

Wait, I just realized that I conflated the location of objects. Let me check again:

- green_ball_1 is in room_2 (correct)
- purple_box_1 is in room_2 (correct)
- red_box_1 is in room_2 (correct)
- yellow_box_1 is in room_3 (correct)
- blue_ball_1 is in room_3 (correct)
- green_ball_2 is in room_4 (correct)
- grey_box_1 is in room_4 (correct)
- purple_box_2 is in room_4 (correct)

So my plan is correct. The final plan is:

```
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3
toggle yellow_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4
toggle grey_door_1
gotoroom room_3 room_4 grey_door_1
gotoobject purple_box_2 room_4
gotoobject grey_box_1 room_4
pick grey_box_1 room_4
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3
gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1
gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_1
gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_2
toggle red_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_2 red_door_1
gotoobject purple_box_1 room_2
gotoempty
drop grey_box_1 room_2
gotoobject green_ball_1 room_2
pick green_ball_1 room_2
gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_4
toggle blue_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_4 blue_door_1
gotoempty
drop green_ball_1 room_4
gotodoor blue_door_1 room_4 room_2
gotoroom room_4 room_2 blue_door_1

pick red_box_1 room_2
gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_1
gotoroom room_2 room_1 red_door_1
gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_2
toggle red_door_1
toggle red_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_2 red_door_1
gotoempty
drop red_box_1 room_2
gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_4
gotoroom room_2 room_4 blue_door_1
gotoobject green_ball_1 room_4
pick green_ball_1 room_4
gotodoor blue_door_1 room_4 room_2
gotoroom room_4 room_2 blue_door_1
gotoempty
drop green_ball_1 room_2
gotoobject green_ball_1 room_2
```
