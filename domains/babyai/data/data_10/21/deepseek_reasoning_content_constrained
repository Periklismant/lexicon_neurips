Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. First, I need to understand the initial state, the goal, and all the constraints. The goal is to have a green ball in room_2, with me in room_2 and in front of that ball. The initial state says green_ball_1 is already in room_2, so maybe that's the one we need. But the constraints complicate things.

So, the constraints require several things. Let's list them:

1. At some state, I must be holding an object.
2. Red_door_1 must be unlocked at some point.
3. Before red_door_1 is unlocked, either grey_box_1 is in room_2 or I'm holding green_ball_1.
4. Red_door_1 must be locked again at some point.
5. If red_door_1 is locked in state s, then I must be holding an object at s or after.
6. I must be in front of purple_box_2 at some point.
7. At some state, either I'm in front of blue_door_1 or holding grey_box_1.
8. I must be in room_2 at some point.
9. Before being in room_2, I must have either held an object or grey_door_1 was unlocked.
10. I must be in room_1 at some point.
11. When in room_1, either I'm holding blue_ball_1 or holding some object at that state or after.
12. At some point, either in front of purple_box_1 or holding an object.
13. Green_ball_1 must be in room_4 at some point.
14. At some point, holding red_box_1 or holding any object.

Hmm, the goal is to end up in room_2 in front of a green ball (green_ball_1), which is already there. But constraints require moving green_ball_1 to room_4 at some point. Wait, constraint 13 says green_ball_1 must be in room_4 in some state. So even though the goal requires it to be in room_2, we have to move it to room_4 temporarily. But how? Because the initial state has green_ball_1 in room_2. So we need to pick it up, take it to room_4, drop it, then bring it back? That seems necessary.

But first, let's look at the doors. All doors are initially locked. So to move between rooms, I need to unlock doors. But unlocking doors requires being in front of them. To get to a door, I need to be in the room connected by that door. But doors are locked, so I can't go through until they're unlocked. Wait, but the goto door action's precondition is that I'm in a room connected by the door and there's no object blocking the position in front of the door. Once I'm in front of the door, I can toggle it (unlock). Then use gotoroom to move through.

So initial position is room_1. Let's see the doors connected to room_1: red_door_1 connects to room_2, and yellow_door_1 connects to room_3. Both are locked. So to get to room_2 from room_1, need to unlock red_door_1. But to unlock red_door_1, I need to be in front of it. But red_door_1 is between room_1 and room_2. So I'm in room_1, go to the red_door_1 (but there's no object blocking it?), then toggle to unlock.

Wait, the initial state doesn't mention any objects blocking doors. So maybe I can go to red_door_1 in room_1. So first, gotoempty to get in front of an empty spot, then gotodoor red_door_1 in room_1. Wait, the preconditions for gotodoor are that I'm in a room connected by the door (room_1 is connected via red_door_1 to room_2), and that there's no object blocking the position. Since the initial state doesn't mention any objects blocking doors, perhaps it's safe. So:

1. gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_2 (from room_1, since that's where I am)
But wait, the gotodoor action is "gotodoor d r1 r2", where r1 is the current room. So in room_1, the door is red_door_1 connecting to room_2.

So step by step:

Start in room_1.

1. gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_2. This requires being in room_1 (which I am) and no object blocking. Since initial state doesn't mention any objects in front of doors, this should work. Then, toggle red_door_1 to unlock it.

But constraint 2 says red_door_1 must be unlocked at some state. But constraint 3 says before unlocking red_door_1, either grey_box_1 is in room_2 or I'm holding green_ball_1. But initially, grey_box_1 is in room_4. So that's not possible. So to unlock red_door_1, I need to have either moved grey_box_1 to room_2 or be holding green_ball_1.

But green_ball_1 is in room_2. Wait, but I'm in room_1. How do I get to room_2? The door is locked. So I need to unlock red_door_1 first. But that's a catch-22. So maybe the only way is to first go to room_2 via another door? Wait, no. The doors are all locked. So perhaps I need to use another door. Let's see. The doors are red (room1-room2), yellow (room1-room3), blue (room2-room4), grey (room3-room4). All are locked.

So, perhaps I need to unlock another door first. For example, unlock yellow_door_1 to get to room_3. But to do that, I need to be in room_1, go to yellow_door_1, toggle it. But again, same problem: any constraints?

Wait, the constraints that are related to other doors may not apply. Let's see the constraints again.

Constraint 3: Before red_door_1 is unlocked, either grey_box_1 is in room_2 or I'm holding green_ball_1. So if I can't get to room_2 to get green_ball_1 without unlocking red_door_1, which requires already meeting that condition, this seems impossible. Therefore, the only way is to have grey_box_1 moved to room_2 before unlocking red_door_1. But how? Because grey_box_1 is in room_4. To move it to room_2, I need to go through blue_door_1 (from room_2 to room4) or grey_door_1 (from room3 to room4). But all doors are locked. So maybe the plan involves unlocking multiple doors in a certain order.

Alternatively, maybe I need to first unlock yellow_door_1 in room_1, go to room_3, unlock grey_door_1 to go to room4, get grey_box_1, bring it to room2 via room4's blue_door_1 to room2, but blue_door_1 is locked. So this seems complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a way to unlock red_door_1 without being in front of it. But the toggle action requires being in front of the door. So to toggle red_door_1, I need to be in front of it in room_1. But to do that, I need to be in room_1 and go to the door. But the precondition for gotodoor is that there's no object blocking. If there's an object blocking the door, I can't go there. But initial state doesn't mention any objects blocking doors. So maybe the initial path is possible.

But according to constraint 3, before unlocking red_door_1, either grey_box_1 is in room_2 or I'm holding green_ball_1. Initially, grey_box_1 is in room4. So unless I can move it, that condition can't be met. But I can't get to room4 without going through other doors, which are locked. So maybe the only way is to have the agent be holding green_ball_1 before unlocking red_door_1. But how can the agent hold green_ball_1 if it's in room_2 and the agent is in room_1? They can't pick it up unless they are in the same room.

So this seems impossible. Therefore, perhaps there's a mistake in my understanding. Wait, the initial state says green_ball_1 is in room_2. The agent starts in room_1. To get to room_2, the agent needs to go through red_door_1, which is locked. To unlock it, the agent needs to be in front of it. So the agent is in room_1, goes to red_door_1, toggles it (unlock). But according to constraint 3, before unlocking red_door_1, either grey_box_1 is in room_2 (which it's not) or the agent is holding green_ball_1 (which is in room_2). But the agent can't be holding green_ball_1 unless they are in room_2, which requires unlocking red_door_1 first. So this is a catch-22.

This suggests that the problem is unsolvable, but that's not possible. There must be a way. Let's check the constraints again. Constraint 3 says that if red_door_1 is unlocked in some state, then there must be an earlier state where either grey_box_1 is in room_2 or the agent is holding green_ball_1. But since the agent can't get into room_2 to pick up green_ball_1 without unlocking red_door_1, which requires the condition to be met before, how can this happen?

Wait, maybe the agent can unlock another door first. For example, go to room_3 via yellow_door_1. Let's see. The yellow_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3. So in room_1, the agent can go to yellow_door_1, toggle it to unlock. But to do that, need to check constraints related to that door. But there's no constraint specifically about yellow_door_1. So maybe:

1. In room_1, gotoempty (to get in front of empty spot, but maybe not necessary)
Wait, the initial position is in room_1. To go to a door, I can do gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3. Then toggle it. Then go to room_3. Then from room_3, go to grey_door_1, unlock it, go to room_4. Then in room_4, get grey_box_1, carry it to room_2 via blue_door_1. But blue_door_1 is between room_2 and room_4. So to get to room_2 from room_4, need to go through blue_door_1. But blue_door_1 is locked. So the agent would need to unlock it. But to unlock blue_door_1, the agent must be in room_2 or room_4. If the agent is in room_4, can they go to blue_door_1? The door connects room_2 and room_4. So in room_4, the agent can go to blue_door_1, toggle it to unlock. Then go to room_2. But initially, blue_door_1 is locked. So the steps could be:

- From room_1, unlock yellow_door_1, go to room_3.
- Unlock grey_door_1, go to room4.
- In room4, unlock blue_door_1, then go to room2.
- In room2, pick up green_ball_1, then go back through blue_door_1 to room4, drop it (to satisfy constraint 13: green_ball_1 must be in room4 at some state).
- Then carry grey_box_1 to room2 (so that condition 3 is met: grey_box_1 is in room2 before unlocking red_door_1? Wait, but red_door_1 is between room1 and room2. If the agent is in room2 via blue_door_1, then they can go to room1 via red_door_1 once it's unlocked. But to unlock red_door_1, they need to be in room1, go to red_door_1, then toggle. But before that, the agent must have grey_box_1 in room2 or be holding green_ball_1. So if the agent brings grey_box_1 to room2, then they can unlock red_door_1 from room1.

Wait, let's outline this step by step:

1. Agent starts in room1.

2. gotoempty (maybe not necessary, but to get in front of an empty spot? Not sure. Or go directly to yellow_door_1.

Action: gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3. Since in room1, and no blocking objects, this should work.

Effect: Now in front of yellow_door_1.

3. toggle yellow_door_1. Now it's unlocked.

4. gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1. Now in room3.

5. In room3, go to grey_door_1 (gotodoor grey_door_1 room3 room4). Toggle to unlock.

6. gotoroom room3 room4 grey_door_1. Now in room4.

7. In room4, go to grey_box_1 (gotoobject grey_box_1 room4). Pick it up (since hands are empty). Now holding grey_box_1. This satisfies some constraints: holding an object (constraint 1 and 14).

8. Now, need to take grey_box_1 to room2. To get to room2 from room4, need to go through blue_door_1. But blue_door_1 is locked. So agent is in room4, needs to unlock blue_door_1. So:

9. gotodoor blue_door_1 room4 room2. Toggle to unlock.

10. Now, gotoroom room4 room2 blue_door_1. Now in room2.

11. Drop grey_box_1 in room2. Now grey_box_1 is in room2. This satisfies constraint 3 (grey_box_1 is in room2 before unlocking red_door_1).

12. Now, the agent is in room2. Need to get back to room1 to unlock red_door_1. To do that, go through red_door_1. But red_door_1 is locked. So first, need to go to red_door_1 from room2. Wait, room2 is connected to room1 via red_door_1. So agent is in room2, can go to red_door_1 (gotodoor red_door_1 room2 room1). Then toggle to unlock. But wait, red_door_1 is in room2. So:

13. gotodoor red_door_1 room2 room1. Toggle to unlock. Now red_door_1 is unlocked. But constraint 2 says it must be unlocked at some state, which is now. Also, constraint 3 is satisfied because grey_box_1 is in room2 now.

14. Now, agent can go to room1 via red_door_1. gotoroom room2 room1 red_door_1. Now in room1.

But constraint 10 says the agent must be in room1 at some state, which they are now. Also, constraint 11 says when in room1, either holding blue_ball_1 or some object. Currently, after dropping grey_box_1 in room2, the agent is not holding anything. So to satisfy constraint 11, after arriving in room1, they need to pick up an object. But blue_ball_1 is in room3. So perhaps the agent needs to go back to room3. But maybe there's another way.

Wait, after step 14, the agent is in room1. They need to satisfy constraint 11: when in room1 (current state), they must hold blue_ball_1 or some object now or later. So maybe they can pick up another object later.

But let's continue. The goal requires being in room2 in front of green_ball_1, which is already there. But constraint 13 requires green_ball_1 to be in room4 at some state. So the agent needs to move green_ball_1 to room4 and then back.

So after step 14, agent is in room1. They can go back to room2 via red_door_1 (now unlocked). Then pick up green_ball_1, take it to room4 via blue_door_1, drop it, then bring it back.

But let's proceed step by step.

15. From room1, goto red_door_1 (gotodoor red_door_1 room1 room2). Then toggle to lock it again (since constraint 4 requires red_door_1 to be locked at some state). Wait, but after unlocking it, we need to lock it again. Also, constraint 5 says if red_door_1 is locked in state s, then agent must hold an object at s or after. So after locking, the agent must hold something either during or after.

So steps after step 14:

15. In room1, gotoempty (to be in front of empty spot, perhaps not necessary). Then gotodoor red_door_1 room1 room2. Then toggle to lock it. Now red_door_1 is locked again. This satisfies constraint 4. Now, constraint 5: when locked, agent must hold an object at that state or after. At this point, after locking, agent is not holding anything. So they need to pick up an object after this. So after locking, they need to pick up something.

But how? The agent is in room1. The objects in room1 are none (initial state). So they need to go to another room to get an object.

Wait, initial state: room1 has no objects except the agent. All boxes and balls are in other rooms. So agent needs to go to another room to pick up an object.

So after locking red_door_1 (step 15), agent must go to another room, pick up an object.

But let's see. The current plan:

15. gotodoor red_door_1 room1 room2. Toggle (now locked). Now in front of red_door_1.

16. gotoroom room1 room2 red_door_1. Wait, but red_door_1 is locked now. So can't go through. So this step is invalid. Therefore, after locking red_door_1, agent is stuck in room1. So that's a problem.

Ah, this is a mistake. So after step 14, agent is in room1. Then steps 15: goto red_door_1, toggle to lock. Now red_door_1 is locked. But agent is in room1, and can't go to room2 anymore unless they unlock it again. But if they lock it, they need to ensure that constraint 5 is met: when red_door_1 is locked (in this state), the agent must hold an object at this state or after. But at this state (step 15), agent is not holding anything, so they need to pick up an object after this. But they are in room1, which has no objects. So they need to go to another room. But how?

Wait, maybe the agent can go back to room3 via yellow_door_1, which is already unlocked. From room1, gotodoor yellow_door_1 room1 room3 (which is unlocked). Then go to room3, pick up blue_ball_1 (which is in room3). Then return to room1. But the yellow_door_1 was unlocked earlier, so they can go through.

Let's adjust the plan:

After step 14 (agent in room1), steps:

15. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room1 room3. Toggle? No, because yellow_door_1 was already unlocked. Wait, no. In step3, we toggled yellow_door_1 to unlock it. So it's unlocked. So agent can go through it.

16. gotoroom room1 room3 yellow_door_1. Now in room3.

17. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room3. Pick it up. Now holding blue_ball_1. This satisfies constraint 11 when they were in room1 (earlier step 14) and now, after being in room1, they are holding an object.

18. Now, need to return to room1 to lock red_door_1. So go back through yellow_door_1.

19. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room3 room1. Then gotoroom room3 room1 yellow_door_1. Now in room1.

20. Now in room1, holding blue_ball_1. Go to red_door_1 (gotodoor red_door_1 room1 room2). Toggle to lock it. Now red_door_1 is locked. This satisfies constraint 4. Also, constraint5: since the agent is holding blue_ball_1 at this state (step20), which is during the state when red_door_1 is locked. So that's good.

21. Now, agent needs to go to room2 again. But red_door_1 is locked. So they need to unlock it again. But to unlock, they need to toggle it again. But to toggle, they must be in front of it. So from room1, gotodoor red_door_1 room1 room2. Toggle to unlock again. Now red_door_1 is unlocked. But this may interfere with constraints. Wait, constraint3 says before unlocking red_door_1 (any time), either grey_box_1 is in room2 or holding green_ball_1. At this point, grey_box_1 is in room2 (step11), so condition is met. So this is allowed.

22. Now, gotoroom room1 room2 red_door_1. Now in room2.

23. Drop blue_ball_1 in room2. Now, constraint 11 is satisfied (when in room1, agent was holding blue_ball_1 in step20).

24. Now, agent is in room2. Need to pick up green_ball_1 to move it to room4.

25. gotoobject green_ball_1 room2. Pick it up. Now holding green_ball_1.

26. Need to take it to room4. So go through blue_door_1 (which is unlocked from step9). So gotodoor blue_door_1 room2 room4. Then gotoroom room2 room4 blue_door_1. Now in room4.

27. Drop green_ball_1 in room4. This satisfies constraint13: green_ball_1 is in room4.

28. Now, pick it up again. Because we need to bring it back to room2 for the goal.

29. gotoobject green_ball_1 room4. Pick it up.

30. Go back to room2 via blue_door_1. gotodoor blue_door_1 room4 room2. Toggle? No, it's already unlocked. So gotoroom room4 room2 blue_door_1. Now in room2.

31. Drop green_ball_1 in room2. Now it's back where it started.

But the goal is to have the agent in room2 in front of green_ball_1. So after dropping, the agent is in front of it. But after dropping, the agent is in front of green_ball_1. So maybe:

After step31, agent is in room2, in front of green_ball_1. So the goal is met.

But wait, the drop action requires that after dropping, the agent is in front of the object. So yes. So after dropping green_ball_1 in room2, the agent is in front of it. So the goal is satisfied.

But let's check all constraints:

1. Holding an object: yes, steps7 (grey_box_1), step17 (blue_ball_1), step25 (green_ball_1), step29 (green_ball_1).

2. Red_door_1 unlocked: steps3 (unlocked), step21 (unlocked again). But in step21, it was unlocked again, but constraint3 is satisfied because grey_box_1 is in room2.

3. Before red_door_1 is unlocked (steps3 and step21), in step3, the agent hadn't moved grey_box_1 to room2 yet. Wait, step3 is when yellow_door_1 is unlocked. Red_door_1 is unlocked in step13 and step21. Wait, step13 is in room2, unlocking red_door_1 from room2. Wait, no, step13 was gotodoor red_door_1 room2 room1, then toggle. So that's unlocking red_door_1 from room2. But initially, red_door_1 was locked, so unlocking it would require being in front of it. But in room2, the agent can go to red_door_1, toggle it. So that's a different scenario. But in this case, the condition for constraint3 is that before unlocking red_door_1, either grey_box_1 is in room2 or holding green_ball_1. At step13, grey_box_1 was moved to room2 in step11. So when unlocking red_door_1 in step13, grey_box_1 is in room2, satisfying constraint3.

Similarly, when unlocking in step21, grey_box_1 is still in room2, so it's okay.

4. Red_door_1 locked: step20.

5. When red_door_1 is locked in step20, agent is holding blue_ball_1, so constraint5 is satisfied.

6. In front of purple_box_2: purple_box_2 is in room4. So the agent needs to be in front of it. When in room4, steps7 (carrying grey_box_1), then after dropping green_ball_1 in step27, maybe go to purple_box_2. So need to add steps to gotoobject purple_box_2 in room4. Let's see:

After step27, agent is in room4, after dropping green_ball_1. Then:

28. gotoobject purple_box_2 room4. Now in front of purple_box_2. This satisfies constraint6.

Then proceed to pick it up again, but maybe not necessary. Alternatively, just being in front of it once is enough.

7. Either in front of blue_door_1 or holding grey_box_1: steps9 (goto blue_door_1 in room4) satisfies being in front of blue_door_1. Also, step7-11, agent is holding grey_box_1. So constraint7 is satisfied.

8. Agent is in room2 multiple times: steps10, step14 (if any?), step22, etc. So constraint8 is satisfied.

9. Before being in room2 (step10), agent was holding grey_box_1 (step7-10), so constraint9 is satisfied.

10. Agent is in room1 initially, step14, step19. So constraint10 is satisfied.

11. When in room1 (step14, step19, step20), in step20, agent is holding blue_ball_1. So constraint11 is satisfied.

12. In front of purple_box_1 or holding object: purple_box_1 is in room2. When agent is in room2 (step11, step22, etc.), they can gotoobject purple_box_1. Or while holding objects (steps7,17,25,29). So either way, constraint12 is satisfied.

13. Green_ball_1 is in room4 at step27, so constraint13 is met.

14. Holding red_box_1 or any object. Since the agent holds grey_box_1, blue_ball_1, green_ball_1, this is satisfied.

Other constraints:

Constraint4: red_door_1 is locked in step20.

Constraint7: step9 (in front of blue_door_1).

Constraint6: step28 (in front of purple_box_2).

So this plan seems to satisfy all constraints. Let's outline the steps properly, making sure all actions are valid.

Full plan:

1. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3
2. toggle yellow_door_1
3. gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1
4. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4
5. toggle grey_door_1
6. gotoroom room_3 room_4 grey_door_1
7. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_4
8. pick grey_box_1 room_4
9. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_4 room_2
10. toggle blue_door_1
11. gotoroom room_4 room_2 blue_door_1
12. drop grey_box_1 room_2
13. gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_1
14. toggle red_door_1
15. gotoroom room_2 room_1 red_door_1
16. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3
17. gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1
18. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_3
19. pick blue_ball_1 room_3
20. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1
21. gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_1
22. gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_2
23. toggle red_door_1
24. gotoroom room_1 room_2 red_door_1
25. drop blue_ball_1 room_2
26. gotoobject green_ball_1 room_2
27. pick green_ball_1 room_2
28. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_4
29. gotoroom room_2 room_4 blue_door_1
30. drop green_ball_1 room_4
31. gotoobject purple_box_2 room_4
32. gotoobject green_ball_1 room_4
33. pick green_ball_1 room_4
34. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_4 room_2
35. gotoroom room_4 room_2 blue_door_1
36. drop green_ball_1 room_2
37. gotoobject green_ball_1 room_2

Wait, but after step36, the agent is in room2, drops green_ball_1, and is now in front of it. So step37 is redundant. Let's check:

After step35, agent is in room2. Then step36: drop green_ball_1 room2. Now agent is in front of green_ball_1 in room2. So the goal is achieved.

But need to make sure all steps are correct. Let's check each action's preconditions and effects.

Step1: gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3. Preconditions: in room_1 (yes), door connects room_1 to room_3 (yes), no object blocking (assumed yes). Valid.

Step2: toggle yellow_door_1. Precondition: in front of it (after step1, yes). Toggles from locked to unlocked. Valid.

Step21: gotoroom room3 room1 yellow_door_1. Valid.

Step22: gotodoor red_door_1 room1 room2. In room1. Valid.

Step23: toggle red_door_1. Now locking it. Valid.

Step24: gotoroom room1 room2 red_door_1. But red_door_1 is now locked (step23). So this action is invalid. Oops! This is a mistake.

Ah, here's a problem. After step23, the agent toggled red_door_1 to lock it. So step24's precondition (door is unlocked) is not met. Therefore, this action is invalid. So this part of the plan is flawed.

This is a critical error. So after step23, the agent is in front of red_door_1 in room1, which is now locked. So they can't go through. So the plan needs to be adjusted.

So how to proceed? Let's rethink steps 22-24.

After step21, agent is in room1, holding blue_ball_1. They need to lock red_door_1 (to satisfy constraint4) and then go to room2 again. But after locking, they can't go through. So maybe they need to unlock it again, but that requires meeting constraint3 again. Since grey_box_1 is still in room2, it's okay.

So revised steps after step21:

22. gotodoor red_door_1 room1 room2. Valid.

23. toggle red_door_1. Now it's locked. Satisfies constraint4.

At this point, agent is in front of red_door_1 in room1, which is locked. They need to unlock it again to go to room2. But to unlock, they need to be in front of it. They are already there.

24. toggle red_door_1 again. Now it's unlocked.

But constraint3 requires that before unlocking, grey_box_1 is in room2 or holding green_ball_1. grey_box_1 is in room2 (step12), so valid.

25. gotoroom room1 room2 red_door_1. Now in room2.

26. drop blue_ball_1 room2. Now in front of it.

Then proceed to pick green_ball_1, take it to room4, etc.

But this adds steps. Also, constraint5 says if red_door_1 is locked in state s (step23), then agent must hold an object at s or after. In step23, agent is holding blue_ball_1, so constraint5 is satisfied.

So adjusted steps:

After step21 (agent in room1, holding blue_ball_1):

22. gotodoor red_door_1 room1 room2.

23. toggle red_door_1 (now locked).

24. toggle red_door_1 again (now unlocked).

25. gotoroom room1 room2 red_door_1.

26. drop blue_ball_1 room2.

Then proceed to pick green_ball_1.

But this requires more steps. Let's see:

22. gotodoor red_door_1 room1 room2

23. toggle red_door_1 (locked)

24. toggle red_door_1 (unlocked)

25. gotoroom room1 room2 red_door_1

26. drop blue_ball_1 room2

27. gotoobject green_ball_1 room2

28. pick green_ball_1 room2

29. gotodoor blue_door_1 room2 room4

30. gotoroom room2 room4 blue_door_1

31. drop green_ball_1 room4

32. gotoobject purple_box_2 room4

33. gotoobject green_ball_1 room4

34. pick green_ball_1 room4

35. gotodoor blue_door_1 room4 room2

36. gotoroom room4 room2 blue_door_1

37. drop green_ball_1 room2

Now, the agent is in room2 in front of green_ball_1. Goal achieved.

But this adds several steps. Let's check if all constraints are still satisfied.

- Constraint4: red_door_1 is locked in step23.

- Constraint5: during step23, agent is holding blue_ball_1, so satisfied.

- Constraint3: before unlocking red_door_1 in step24, grey_box_1 is in room2, so valid.

Other constraints should still be met.

But this makes the plan longer. However, the problem requires an optimal plan (shortest possible). So perhaps there's a shorter way.

Alternative approach: instead of toggling red_door_1 twice, maybe find a way to lock it while holding an object and then not needing to unlock it again.

Alternatively, after step15 (agent in room1), they can pick up an object from room1, but there are none. So they have to go to another room.

Alternatively, maybe after step15 (in room1), they go to room3 via yellow_door_1, pick up blue_ball_1, return to room1, lock red_door_1 while holding blue_ball_1, then drop it in room1. But room1 has no objects, so dropping would place it there. But then constraint11: when in room1, agent must hold an object then or after. If they drop it in room1, then after that, they are not holding anything. So they need to pick up something else. But there's nothing else in room1. So that's not helpful.

Hmm. This seems quite complex. The key issue is that after locking red_door_1 in step23, the agent must hold an object at that time or after. Since they are holding blue_ball_1 during step23, it's okay. Then they can drop it in room2 after unlocking and going through again.

But this requires several steps. Let's count the steps in the revised plan:

1. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3

2. toggle yellow_door_1

3. gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1

4. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4

5. toggle grey_door_1

6. gotoroom room_3 room_4 grey_door_1

7. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_4

8. pick grey_box_1 room_4

9. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_4 room_2

10. toggle blue_door_1

11. gotoroom room_4 room_2 blue_door_1

12. drop grey_box_1 room_2

13. gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_1

14. toggle red_door_1

15. gotoroom room_2 room_1 red_door_1

16. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3

17. gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1

18. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_3

19. pick blue_ball_1 room_3

20. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1

21. gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_1

22. gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_2

23. toggle red_door_1 (locked)

24. toggle red_door_1 (unlocked)

25. gotoroom room_1 room_2 red_door_1

26. drop blue_ball_1 room_2

27. gotoobject green_ball_1 room_2

28. pick green_ball_1 room_2

29. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_4

30. gotoroom room_2 room_4 blue_door_1

31. drop green_ball_1 room_4

32. gotoobject purple_box_2 room_4

33. gotoobject green_ball_1 room_4

34. pick green_ball_1 room_4

35. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_4 room_2

36. gotoroom room_4 room_2 blue_door_1

37. drop green_ball_1 room_2

This is 37 steps. But maybe there's a shorter way. For example, after step12 (grey_box_1 in room2), instead of going back to room1, maybe the agent can go directly to room3 via other doors. But I think this is the minimal path given the constraints.

Alternatively, after step12, the agent can go to room3 via blue_door_1 and room4, but that's longer.

Alternatively, after step12, the agent is in room2. They need to get back to room1 to lock red_door_1. But they can't go through red_door_1 unless it's unlocked. So they have to unlock it first. But they need to meet constraint3 again. But grey_box_1 is in room2, so it's okay.

Wait, perhaps after step12:

13. gotodoor red_door_1 room2 room1 (already unlocked from step14?)

Wait, earlier steps:

After step14: toggle red_door_1 (unlocked), then gotoroom room2 room1 red_door_1 (step15). Then agent is in room1.

So after step15, agent is in room1, and red_door_1 is unlocked. Then they go to room3, get blue_ball_1, return to room1, then lock red_door_1.

But when they lock red_door_1, they are holding blue_ball_1, satisfying constraint5.

Then, to get back to room2, they need to unlock red_door_1 again (step24), which is allowed because grey_box_1 is in room2.

This seems necessary.

Alternatively, maybe after step15, the agent can go directly to room2 via red_door_1 (which is unlocked), but they need to lock it first. Wait, no. After step15, agent is in room1. They need to lock red_door_1, which requires being in front of it and toggling. Then, they can unlock it again.

This seems unavoidable. So the plan has to include locking and unlocking red_door_1.

Thus, the plan with 37 steps may be the only way. But maybe there are redundant steps. For example, after step31 (green_ball_1 in room4), the agent can immediately pick it up and return to room2 without visiting purple_box_2. But constraint6 requires being in front of purple_box_2. So step32 is necessary.

Another optimization: after step31, drop green_ball_1 in room4, then gotoobject purple_box_2, then pick up green_ball_1 again. So steps31-34 can be:

31. drop green_ball_1 room4

32. gotoobject purple_box_2 room4

33. gotoobject green_ball_1 room4

34. pick green_ball_1 room4

But step33 is necessary to be in front of green_ball_1 to pick it up.

Alternatively, after step31, agent is in front of green_ball_1 (since drop action places them in front of it). So step31: drop green_ball_1 room4. Now in front of it. So step32 is gotoobject purple_box_2, which moves them away. Then step33: gotoobject green_ball_1 to pick it up.

But this adds steps. Alternatively, after dropping green_ball_1 in room4 (step31), the agent can immediately gotoobject purple_box_2 (step32), then return to green_ball_1. But this may not be necessary if the agent can be in front of purple_box_2 in another way.

Alternatively, during step9-11, when the agent is in room4, they can gotoobject purple_box_2 before moving to room2. But that would require extra steps.

But regardless, the plan as outlined seems to meet all constraints. Now, the final step is to drop green_ball_1 in room2 and be in front of it, achieving the goal.

Thus, the final plan would include all these steps. However, this is quite long. But given the constraints, it's necessary. The optimal plan would be the shortest possible. Maybe there's a shorter path. For example, after moving grey_box_1 to room2, maybe the agent can use red_door_1 to go back to room1, lock it, then use another door to return to room2 without needing to go through room3 and room4 again. But how?

Alternatively, after step12 (grey_box_1 in room2), agent is in room2. They can gotodoor blue_door_1 to room4, unlock it, but that's already done. Then go to room4, get green_ball_1 and move it. But the agent hasn't picked up green_ball_1 yet. Wait, green_ball_1 is initially in room2. So in step12, agent is in room2. They can pick up green_ball_1, take it to room4 via blue_door_1, drop it, then bring it back. This would satisfy constraint13.

Let's try a different approach:

1. Unlock yellow_door_1, go to room3.

2. Unlock grey_door_1, go to room4.

3. Get grey_box_1, go to room2 via blue_door_1 (unlock).

4. Drop grey_box_1 in room2.

5. Go to red_door_1 in room2, unlock, go to room1.

6. Lock red_door_1 while holding an object.

7. Unlock red_door_1 again (since grey_box_1 is in room2), go to room2.

8. Pick green_ball_1, take to room4, drop, then return.

But this requires fewer steps. Let's see:

Steps:

1. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3

2. toggle yellow_door_1

3. gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1

4. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4

5. toggle grey_door_1

6. gotoroom room_3 room_4 grey_door_1

7. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_4

8. pick grey_box_1 room_4

9. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_4 room_2

10. toggle blue_door_1

11. gotoroom room_4 room_2 blue_door_1

12. drop grey_box_1 room_2

13. gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_1

14. toggle red_door_1 (unlock)

15. gotoroom room_2 room_1 red_door_1

16. gotoobject empty (or gotodoor red_door_1 again)

17. gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_2

18. toggle red_door_1 (lock) → now, agent is holding grey_box_1 no, agent dropped it in step12. So agent is not holding anything. So can't lock here because constraint5 would require holding an object. So need to pick up something.

Thus, after step15 (in room1), agent must pick up an object. But room1 has none. So need to go to room3 again.

This leads us back to the previous plan.

Thus, the initial plan seems unavoidable. Therefore, the optimal plan is likely the one with 37 steps, but perhaps some steps can be optimized.

For example, after step31 (drop green_ball_1 in room4), the agent can immediately pick it up again without needing to gotoobject:

After dropping, agent is in front of green_ball_1, so can pick it up directly. So steps31 and 34 can be merged:

31. drop green_ball_1 room4

32. pick green_ball_1 room4

But wait, after dropping, agent is in front of green_ball_1, so they can pick it up without moving. So step31: drop, step32: pick. Then proceed.

This saves two steps (steps32 and33). Similarly, other steps may be optimized.

Let's try to shorten the plan:

Revised steps after step30 (gotoroom room2 room4 blue_door_1):

31. drop green_ball_1 room4

32. gotoobject purple_box_2 room4

33. pick green_ball_1 room4 (since after step31, agent is in front of green_ball_1, but needs to go to purple_box_2 first, then come back)

Wait, no. After step31, agent is in front of green_ball_1 (from drop action). To satisfy constraint6 (in front of purple_box_2), they need to go to it. So step32: gotoobject purple_box_2 room4.

33. Then, gotoobject green_ball_1 room4.

34. pick green_ball_1 room4.

Thus, steps31-34 are:

31. drop green_ball_1 room4

32. gotoobject purple_box_2 room4

33. gotoobject green_ball_1 room4

34. pick green_ball_1 room4

But this requires moving to purple_box_2 and back, which adds steps. Alternatively, after dropping green_ball_1, gotoobject purple_box_2, then return to green_ball_1.

But this is necessary to satisfy constraint6. Thus, it can't be avoided.

In conclusion, the optimal plan must include all necessary steps to meet all constraints. Despite its length, the plan provided meets all constraints and achieves the goal. Therefore, the final answer is as follows.
