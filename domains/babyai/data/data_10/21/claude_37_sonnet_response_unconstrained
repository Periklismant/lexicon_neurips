Let me summarize the problem:

1. We have a 2D gridworld with 4 rooms arranged in a square formation.
2. There are 4 doors connecting the rooms, each with a color.
3. The rooms may contain boxes and balls with different colors.
4. We need to find a valid sequence of actions to solve the planning problem.

Our initial state:
- We're in room_1.
- green_ball_1, purple_box_1, and red_box_1 are in room_2.
- yellow_box_1 and blue_ball_1 are in room_3.
- green_ball_2, grey_box_1, and purple_box_2 are in room_4.
- All doors are locked.
- We're not holding any object.

Our goal:
- We need to be in room_2.
- We need to be in front of a green ball in room_2.

Given that green_ball_1 is in room_2, we need to:
1. Go to room_2.
2. Go in front of green_ball_1.

To go to room_2 from room_1, we need to use the red_door_1. But it's locked, so we need to toggle it first.

Let's plan this step by step:
1. Go to red_door_1 from room_1.
2. Toggle red_door_1 (to unlock it).
3. Go to room_2 from room_1 using red_door_1.
4. Go in front of green_ball_1 in room_2.

That should be it! Let's write down the sequence of actions:

```
gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_2
toggle red_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_2 red_door_1
gotoobject green_ball_1 room_2
```

Let's double-check the validity of each action:

1. gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_2:
   - Precondition: We are in room_1, which is connected to room_2 by red_door_1.
   - Effect: We are in front of red_door_1.

2. toggle red_door_1:
   - Precondition: We are in front of red_door_1.
   - Effect: red_door_1 becomes unlocked.

3. gotoroom room_1 room_2 red_door_1:
   - Precondition: We are in room_1, which is adjacent to room_2, and red_door_1 is unlocked.
   - Effect: We are in room_2.

4. gotoobject green_ball_1 room_2:
   - Precondition: We are in room_2, where green_ball_1 is.
   - Effect: We are in front of green_ball_1.

This sequence of actions should bring about the desired goal, which is to be in room_2 and in front of green_ball_1, which is a green ball in room_2.

So the optimal plan is:

```
gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_2
toggle red_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_2 red_door_1
gotoobject green_ball_1 room_2
```

Hmm, I just realized I might have misunderstood the action specification for "gotodoor". Let me double-check the preconditions for this action.

"goto door": you may only go in front of a door d if (i) you are in a room which door d is connecting with another room, and (ii) there is no object blocking the position in front of d in the room you are currently in.

So, "gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_2" means go in front of red_door_1 which connects room_1 and room_2. This seems correct.

And for the "gotoroom" action:

"goto room": you may only go in a room r if (i) you are currently in a room r0 that is adjacent to r, and (ii) the door that is connecting r0 and r is unlocked.

So, "gotoroom room_1 room_2 red_door_1" means go from room_1 to room_2 using red_door_1. This also seems correct.

Therefore, I'm confident in the validity of the plan:

```
gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_2
toggle red_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_2 red_door_1
gotoobject green_ball_1 room_2
```

Actually, I think the format of "gotodoor" might be "gotodoor d r1 r2", where d is the door, r1 is the room we are in, and r2 is the room on the other side of the door. Let's correct the plan based on this.

Let's start over to make absolutely sure we have the action formulations correct.

For "gotodoor d r1 r2": go in front of door d, which connects room r1 (where we are) to room r2.
For "gotoroom r1 r2 d": go from room r1 to room r2 using door d.

So, the correct action sequence should be:

```
gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_2
toggle red_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_2 red_door_1
gotoobject green_ball_1 room_2
```

This looks correct!

Alright, let's double-check the plan once more:

1. We start in room_1.
2. We go in front of red_door_1, which connects room_1 to room_2.
3. We toggle red_door_1, which unlocks it.
4. We go from room_1 to room_2 using red_door_1.
5. We go in front of green_ball_1, which is a green ball in room_2.

This sequence achieves our goal, which is to be in room_2 and in front of a green ball (green_ball_1).

I think this plan is valid and optimal. Let's finalize it:

```
gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_2
toggle red_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_2 red_door_1
gotoobject green_ball_1 room_2
```

That's our answer.
