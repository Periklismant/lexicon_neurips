Okay, let's see. The goal is to get a green ball in room_2, be in room_2, and be in front of it. The initial state has me in room_1. All doors are locked initially. So first, I need to unlock the doors to move around. Let's look at the objects and doors.

The initial state mentions green_ball_1 is in room_2. So that's a green ball already in room_2. The goal requires that a green ball (which that is) is there, and I'm in front of it in room_2. So maybe I just need to go to room_2 and then go to the green_ball_1. But how to get to room_2?

The doors: room_1 and room_2 are connected via red_door_1, which is locked. So I need to unlock red_door_1. But to unlock it, I have to be in front of it and toggle it. But to get in front of the door, I need to be in a room connected by the door. Since I'm in room_1, red_door_1 connects room_1 and room_2. So I can go to the door from room_1. But wait, the preconditions for "gotodoor" are that I'm in a room connected by the door and there's no object blocking the position in front of the door. Are there any objects blocking doors in room_1? The initial state says objects are in other rooms. Room_1 has me initially, but the objects listed are in room_2, 3, 4. So in room_1, there are no objects blocking doors. So I can go to red_door_1.

So steps: first, go to red_door_1 from room_1. Then toggle it to unlock. Then go through the door to room_2. Then, once in room_2, go to green_ball_1. Then that should satisfy the goal.

Wait, but let's check the constraints. The problem says "a valid plan must abide by the following constraints". Wait, the user hasn't provided any constraints in the problem description. Wait, looking back, the original problem statement says "a set of constraints" but in the given problem, the constraints section is empty. Wait, no. Let me check again.

Wait, the user provided the problem as follows:

The task is to bring about the goal situation, and the constraints are listed after. Wait, looking back:

"A valid plan for the abovementioned problem must abide by the following constraints:"

But then there's nothing listed. That's odd. Wait, maybe a formatting error. Wait, no. Let me check again. The user input ends with "The task is to bring about the following situation... A valid plan... must abide by the following constraints:" and then nothing. So perhaps the constraints were omitted. But that's a problem. Alternatively, maybe the user intended to include constraints but forgot. Without constraints, the problem is to reach the goal state as described, following the action preconditions.

Assuming no additional constraints beyond the action preconditions, proceed.

So the steps would be:

1. Go to red_door_1 in room_1 (using gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_2). Then toggle it to unlock. Then goto room_2 via red_door_1. Then gotoobject green_ball_1 room_2.

Wait, but when you toggle the door, you need to be in front of it. So the sequence would be:

- gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_2 (since the agent is in room_1, which is connected via red_door_1 to room_2, and there's no object blocking it). Then toggle red_door_1. Then gotoroom room_1 room_2 red_door_1. Now in room_2. Then gotoobject green_ball_1 room_2, which puts the agent in front of the green_ball_1. Then the goal is achieved.

But wait, the goal is that "you are in room_2" and "you are in front of v" (the green ball). So once you are in front of green_ball_1 in room_2, that's the goal. So the plan would be:

Action sequence:

1. gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_2
2. toggle red_door_1
3. gotoroom room_1 room_2 red_door_1
4. gotoobject green_ball_1 room_2

But need to check preconditions for each step.

Step 1: gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_2. Preconditions: the agent is in a room connected by the door (room_1 is connected via red_door_1), and no object is blocking the door's position in room_1. Since room_1's objects are not mentioned (the initial state lists objects in other rooms), so no blockage. So this is allowed.

After step 1, the agent is in front of red_door_1.

Step 2: toggle red_door_1. Since the agent is in front of the door, allowed. This unlocks the door (since it was initially locked).

Step 3: gotoroom room_1 room_2 red_door_1. Preconditions: agent is in room_1 (which they are), adjacent to room_2 via red_door_1, and the door is unlocked (now it is). So allowed. After this, agent is in room_2, not in front of anything.

Step 4: gotoobject green_ball_1 room_2. Precondition: agent is in the same room as the object (room_2), which they are. So allowed. Now agent is in front of green_ball_1, in room_2. Which satisfies the goal.

But wait, after step 3, the agent is in room_2 and not in front of anything. Then step 4 makes them in front of the ball. So the final state meets all the goal conditions.

This plan has four actions. Is there a shorter plan? Let's see.

Alternative approach: Maybe using another door? But room_1 is connected to room_3 via yellow_door_1, but that's locked. So to get to room_2 directly via red_door_1 is the quickest. Any other path would require unlocking more doors, leading to longer plans. So four steps seems optimal.

Therefore, the plan is as outlined.
