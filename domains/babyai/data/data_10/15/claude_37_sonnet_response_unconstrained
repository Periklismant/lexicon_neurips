Let me analyze this planning problem:

Initial state:
- I am in room_4.
- Several balls and boxes are distributed in various rooms.
- All doors are locked.
- I'm not holding any object.
- I have only visited room_4.

Goal:
- I need to be in front of a blue door, and that door must be unlocked.

From the object list, I can identify one blue door: blue_door_1, which connects room_3 and room_4.

Since I'm currently in room_4, and blue_door_1 connects room_4 and room_3, I can:
1. Go to the blue door: `gotodoor blue_door_1 room_4 room_3`
2. Unlock (toggle) the door: `toggle blue_door_1`

That should satisfy the goal of being in front of a blue door that's not locked.

Let me verify this plan:
1. `gotodoor blue_door_1 room_4 room_3`: I go to blue_door_1 from room_4, which connects to room_3.
2. `toggle blue_door_1`: I unlock the blue door.

After these actions:
- I am in front of blue_door_1
- blue_door_1 is blue (given in initial state)
- blue_door_1 is unlocked (after toggle action)

This matches all the goal conditions:
- "There is a door d such that "The following conditions are all true: "d is blue", "you are in front of d", "d is not locked"""

So the plan is:
```
gotodoor blue_door_1 room_4 room_3
toggle blue_door_1
```

Actually, I need to double-check whether room_4 is directly connected to room_3. From the initial state description:
"room_4 and room_3 are connected via blue_door_1"
"room_3 and room_4 are connected via blue_door_1"

So my plan is valid. Let me just review once more.

Step 1: `gotodoor blue_door_1 room_4 room_3`
- Precondition: I am in room_4, and blue_door_1 connects room_4 and room_3, and the door is not blocked. All these are satisfied.
- Effect: I am now in front of blue_door_1.

Step 2: `toggle blue_door_1`
- Precondition: I am in front of blue_door_1. This is satisfied after Step 1.
- Effect: blue_door_1 is now unlocked (since it was locked in the initial state).

After these actions, I am in front of blue_door_1, which is blue and unlocked, satisfying the goal.

So my final plan is:
```
gotodoor blue_door_1 room_4 room_3
toggle blue_door_1
```

Actually, I realize that the problem statement doesn't specify whether there are any objects blocking the doors. Let me review the initial state to confirm that no objects are blocking blue_door_1 in room_4.

The initial state doesn't explicitly mention any objects blocking doors, so I assume there are no objects blocking blue_door_1 in room_4. Therefore, I believe my plan is valid.

Let me re-emphasize the final plan:
```
gotodoor blue_door_1 room_4 room_3
toggle blue_door_1
```

Let me re-read the problem statement to make sure I haven't missed anything.

The problem wants me to "provide a valid sequence of actions that solves the planning problem." The goal is: "There is a door d such that "The following conditions are all true: "d is blue", "you are in front of d", "d is not locked"""

The plan I've developed:
1. `gotodoor blue_door_1 room_4 room_3`: This action puts me in front of blue_door_1 from room_4, facing room_3.
2. `toggle blue_door_1`: This action unlocks blue_door_1.

After executing these actions, I am in front of blue_door_1, which is blue (as stated in the initial world state) and unlocked (after toggling), thus satisfying the goal.

So, the final plan is:
```
gotodoor blue_door_1 room_4 room_3
toggle blue_door_1
```

Actually, wait, let me again check the "gotodoor" action to make sure I've done this correctly.

"gotodoor d r1 r2": Go in front of door d, connecting room r1 to room r2.

Since I'm in room_4 and the door connects room_4 and room_3, I should say:
`gotodoor blue_door_1 room_4 room_3`

This specifies that I'm going to the door that connects room_4 (where I am) to room_3.

So my plan remains:
```
gotodoor blue_door_1 room_4 room_3
toggle blue_door_1
```

Let me double-check the problem statement one more time to make sure there isn't a shorter or more optimal plan. The problem statement asks for an optimal plan, so I need to ensure there isn't a valid plan with fewer steps.

Given the initial state and the goal, I need to unlock a blue door and be in front of it. The only blue door in the environment is blue_door_1, which connects room_4 (where I start) and room_3. To achieve the goal, I need to:
1. Go to the blue door.
2. Unlock the door.

There's no shorter valid sequence of actions to achieve this goal. Therefore, my plan is optimal.

```
gotodoor blue_door_1 room_4 room_3
toggle blue_door_1
```
