Let me analyze the initial state, the goal, and the constraints to come up with a valid plan.

Initial State:
- You are in room_4
- Several objects are distributed among the rooms
- All doors are locked
- You are not holding any object
- You have visited room_4

Goal:
- There is a blue door that you are in front of and is not locked

From the world description, there's only one blue door: blue_door_1, which connects room_3 and room_4. 

So to achieve the goal, I need to:
1. Go in front of blue_door_1
2. Unlock blue_door_1 (toggle it)
3. The goal state will be satisfied

However, there are several constraints I need to satisfy:

1. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'blue_door_1 is locked'" - This is already true in the initial state.

2. "If expression 'blue_door_1 is locked' holds in some state s, then expression 'you are holding some object' must hold at s or at some state after s" - This means I need to pick up an object before I toggle blue_door_1.

3. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'blue_door_1 is not locked'" - This will be true after I toggle blue_door_1.

4. "If expression 'blue_door_1 is not locked' holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: 'you are in room_1'" - This means I need to visit room_1 before I unlock blue_door_1.

5. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'At least one of the following conditions is true: "you are in front of purple_door_1", "you are holding green_box_1"'" - I need to either go in front of purple_door_1 or pick up green_box_1 at some point.

6. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'grey_ball_1 is in room_1'" - I need to move grey_ball_1 from room_4 to room_1.

7. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'green_box_1 is in room_4'" - I need to move green_box_1 from room_3 to room_4.

8. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'you are in front of blue_door_1'" - This will be satisfied when I go in front of blue_door_1 to toggle it.

9. "If expression 'you are in front of blue_door_1' holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: 'At least one of the following conditions is true: "you are in front of blue_ball_1", "grey_ball_1 is in room_2"'" - Before I go in front of blue_door_1, I need to either go in front of blue_ball_1 or move grey_ball_1 to room_2.

10. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'At least one of the following conditions is true: "grey_box_1 is in room_3", "green_ball_1 is in room_1"'" - I need to either move grey_box_1 to room_3 or move green_ball_1 to room_1.

11. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'you are holding some object'" - I need to pick up an object at some point.

12. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'At least one of the following conditions is true: "green_ball_1 is in room_2", "you are in front of empty"'" - I need to either move green_ball_1 to room_2 or go in front of an empty position.

13. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'At least one of the following conditions is true: "you are holding purple_ball_1", "you are in front of green_door_1"'" - I need to either pick up purple_ball_1 or go in front of green_door_1.

This is quite a complex set of constraints. Let me try to devise a plan that satisfies all of these:

First, let's consider the doors and the connectivity between rooms:
- purple_door_1 connects room_1 and room_2
- green_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3
- purple_door_2 connects room_2 and room_4
- blue_door_1 connects room_3 and room_4

Currently, I'm in room_4. I need to:
1. Get to room_1 (constraint 4)
2. Move grey_ball_1 to room_1 (constraint 6)
3. Move green_box_1 to room_4 (constraint 7)
4. Either go in front of blue_ball_1 or move grey_ball_1 to room_2 (constraint 9)
5. Either move grey_box_1 to room_3 or move green_ball_1 to room_1 (constraint 10)
6. Pick up an object (constraint 11)
7. Either move green_ball_1 to room_2 or go in front of an empty position (constraint 12)
8. Either pick up purple_ball_1 or go in front of green_door_1 (constraint 13)
9. Finally, go in front of blue_door_1 and toggle it (goal)

Let's plan the path:
1. Starting in room_4, I need to get to room_1. I can do this by going through room_2 or room_3. Since I need to go in front of purple_door_1 (constraint 5), I'll go through room_2.
   - Goto door purple_door_2 to go from room_4 to room_2
   - Toggle purple_door_2 to unlock it
   - Goto room room_4 room_2 purple_door_2
   - Goto door purple_door_1 to go from room_2 to room_1
   - Toggle purple_door_1 to unlock it
   - Goto room room_2 room_1 purple_door_1

2. Now I'm in room_1. I need to move grey_ball_1 to room_1 (constraint 6) and I also need to pick up an object (constraint 11). Let's pick up grey_box_1 in room_1.
   - Gotoobject grey_box_1 room_1
   - Pick grey_box_1 room_1

3. I also need to either move grey_box_1 to room_3 or move green_ball_1 to room_1 (constraint 10). Since I'm already holding grey_box_1, I'll move it to room_3.
   - Goto door green_door_1 room_1 room_3
   - Toggle green_door_1 to unlock it
   - Goto room room_1 room_3 green_door_1
   - Gotoempty (to find an empty spot to drop the box)
   - Drop grey_box_1 room_3

4. Now I need to move green_box_1 to room_4 (constraint 7). I'll pick up green_box_1 in room_3 and move it to room_4.
   - Gotoobject green_box_1 room_3
   - Pick green_box_1 room_3
   - Goto door blue_door_1 room_3 room_4
   - Toggle blue_door_1 to unlock it
   - Goto room room_3 room_4 blue_door_1
   - Gotoempty (to find an empty spot to drop the box)
   - Drop green_box_1 room_4

5. Now I need to go back to room_4 and pick up grey_ball_1, then move it to room_2 (constraint 9).
   - Gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_4
   - Pick grey_ball_1 room_4
   - Goto door purple_door_2 room_4 room_2
   - Goto room room_4 room_2 purple_door_2
   - Gotoempty (to find an empty spot to drop the ball)
   - Drop grey_ball_1 room_2

6. Now I need to go in front of blue_door_1 (constraint 8 and goal). But first, I need to go back to room_4.
   - Goto door purple_door_2 room_2 room_4
   - Goto room room_2 room_4 purple_door_2

7. I need to satisfy constraint 13 (either pick up purple_ball_1 or go in front of green_door_1). I'll pick up purple_ball_1.
   - Gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4
   - Pick purple_ball_1 room_4

8. Finally, I'll go in front of blue_door_1 and toggle it to achieve the goal.
   - Goto door blue_door_1 room_4 room_3
   - Toggle blue_door_1

Wait, I noticed a mistake. The doors are locked at the beginning, so I need to toggle them to unlock them before I can go through them. Let me review and update the plan.

Actually, there's a logical issue I need to resolve. Constraint 2 says that if blue_door_1 is locked, I must be holding an object, but constraint 3 says blue_door_1 must be unlocked at some point. This means I need to be holding an object when I toggle blue_door_1. However, the goal requires that blue_door_1 is not locked, which would happen after I toggle it. 

Also, constraint 4 requires that I visit room_1 before unlocking blue_door_1. And constraint 9 requires that I either go in front of blue_ball_1 or move grey_ball_1 to room_2 before going in front of blue_door_1.

Let me re-draft a more careful plan:

1. Starting in room_4, I need to get to room_1 (constraint 4). I'll go through room_2.
   - Gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4
   - Pick purple_ball_1 room_4 (this satisfies constraint 11 and part of constraint 13)
   - Goto door purple_door_2 room_4 room_2
   - Toggle purple_door_2 to unlock it
   - Goto room room_4 room_2 purple_door_2
   - Gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_2 (this satisfies part of constraint 9)
   - Gotoempty (this satisfies part of constraint 12)
   - Goto door purple_door_1 room_2 room_1
   - Toggle purple_door_1 to unlock it (this satisfies constraint 5)
   - Goto room room_2 room_1 purple_door_1

2. Now I'm in room_1. I'll drop purple_ball_1 and pick up grey_box_1.
   - Gotoempty
   - Drop purple_ball_1 room_1
   - Gotoobject grey_box_1 room_1
   - Pick grey_box_1 room_1

3. I need to move grey_ball_1 to room_1 (constraint 6).
   - Goto door green_door_1 room_1 room_3
   - Toggle green_door_1 to unlock it (this satisfies part of constraint 13)
   - Goto room room_1 room_3 green_door_1
   - Gotoempty
   - Drop grey_box_1 room_3 (this satisfies part of constraint 10)
   - Gotoobject green_ball_1 room_3
   - Pick green_ball_1 room_3
   - Goto door green_door_1 room_3 room_1
   - Goto room room_3 room_1 green_door_1
   - Gotoempty
   - Drop green_ball_1 room_1 (this satisfies part of constraint 10)
   - Gotoobject grey_box_1 room_3
   - Pick grey_box_1 room_3

4. I need to get grey_ball_1 from room_4 to room_1.
   - Goto door green_door_1 room_3 room_1
   - Goto room room_3 room_1 green_door_1
   - Goto door purple_door_1 room_1 room_2
   - Goto room room_1 room_2 purple_door_1
   - Goto door purple_door_2 room_2 room_4
   - Goto room room_2 room_4 purple_door_2
   - Gotoempty
   - Drop grey_box_1 room_4
   - Gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_4
   - Pick grey_ball_1 room_4
   - Goto door purple_door_2 room_4 room_2
   - Goto room room_4 room_2 purple_door_2
   - Goto door purple_door_1 room_2 room_1
   - Goto room room_2 room_1 purple_door_1
   - Gotoempty
   - Drop grey_ball_1 room_1 (this satisfies constraint 6)

5. I need to move green_box_1 to room_4 (constraint 7).
   - Goto door green_door_1 room_1 room_3
   - Goto room room_1 room_3 green_door_1
   - Gotoobject green_box_1 room_3
   - Pick green_box_1 room_3 (this satisfies constraint 5)
   - Goto door blue_door_1 room_3 room_4
   - Toggle blue_door_1 to unlock it (constraint 2 is satisfied because I'm holding green_box_1, and constraint 3 is now satisfied)
   - Goto room room_3 room_4 blue_door_1
   - Gotoempty
   - Drop green_box_1 room_4 (this satisfies constraint 7)

6. Now I need to go in front of blue_door_1 to achieve the goal.
   - Goto door blue_door_1 room_4 room_3 (this satisfies constraint 8)

Wait, there is a complexity. When I toggle blue_door_1, it will be already unlocked, so I need to make sure I satisfy constraint 9 before going in front of blue_door_1.

Let me update the plan:

1. Starting in room_4, I need to get to room_1 (constraint 4). I'll go through room_2.
   - Gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4
   - Pick purple_ball_1 room_4 (this satisfies constraint 11 and part of constraint 13)
   - Goto door purple_door_2 room_4 room_2
   - Toggle purple_door_2 to unlock it
   - Goto room room_4 room_2 purple_door_2
   - Gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_2 (this satisfies part of constraint 9)
   - Gotoempty (this satisfies part of constraint 12)
   - Goto door purple_door_1 room_2 room_1
   - Toggle purple_door_1 to unlock it (this satisfies constraint 5)
   - Goto room room_2 room_1 purple_door_1

2. Now I'm in room_1. I'll drop purple_ball_1 and pick up grey_box_1.
   - Gotoempty
   - Drop purple_ball_1 room_1
   - Gotoobject grey_box_1 room_1
   - Pick grey_box_1 room_1

3. I need to go to room_3 and then to room_4.
   - Goto door green_door_1 room_1 room_3
   - Toggle green_door_1 to unlock it (this satisfies part of constraint 13)
   - Goto room room_1 room_3 green_door_1
   - Gotoempty
   - Drop grey_box_1 room_3 (this satisfies part of constraint 10)
   - Goto door blue_door_1 room_3 room_4 (I need to unlock blue_door_1 to continue)
   - Toggle blue_door_1 to unlock it (constraint 2 is satisfied because I'm carrying nothing, and constraint 3 is now satisfied)
   - Goto room room_3 room_4 blue_door_1

4. Now I need to move grey_ball_1 to room_2 (constraint 9).
   - Gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_4
   - Pick grey_ball_1 room_4
   - Goto door purple_door_2 room_4 room_2
   - Goto room room_4 room_2 purple_door_2
   - Gotoempty
   - Drop grey_ball_1 room_2 (this satisfies part of constraint 9)

5. I need to move green_ball_1 to room_2 (constraint 12).
   - Goto door purple_door_1 room_2 room_1
   - Goto room room_2 room_1 purple_door_1
   - Goto door green_door_1 room_1 room_3
   - Goto room room_1 room_3 green_door_1
   - Gotoobject green_ball_1 room_3
   - Pick green_ball_1 room_3
   - Goto door green_door_1 room_3 room_1
   - Goto room room_3 room_1 green_door_1
   - Goto door purple_door_1 room_1 room_2
   - Goto room room_1 room_2 purple_door_1
   - Gotoempty
   - Drop green_ball_1 room_2 (this satisfies part of constraint 12)

6. I need to move green_box_1 to room_4 (constraint 7).
   - Goto door purple_door_1 room_2 room_1
   - Goto room room_2 room_1 purple_door_1
   - Goto door green_door_1 room_1 room_3
   - Goto room room_1 room_3 green_door_1
   - Gotoobject green_box_1 room_3
   - Pick green_box_1 room_3 (this satisfies constraint 5)
   - Goto door blue_door_1 room_3 room_4
   - Goto room room_3 room_4 blue_door_1
   - Gotoempty
   - Drop green_box_1 room_4 (this satisfies constraint 7)

7. I need to move grey_ball_1 to room_1 (constraint 6).
   - Goto door purple_door_2 room_4 room_2
   - Goto room room_4 room_2 purple_door_2
   - Gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_2
   - Pick grey_ball_1 room_2
   - Goto door purple_door_1 room_2 room_1
   - Goto room room_2 room_1 purple_door_1
   - Gotoempty
   - Drop grey_ball_1 room_1 (this satisfies constraint 6)

8. I need to go in front of blue_door_1 to achieve the goal.
   - Goto door green_door_1 room_1 room_3
   - Goto room room_1 room_3 green_door_1
   - Goto door blue_door_1 room_3 room_4 (this satisfies constraint 8)

Wait, I just realized that I toggled blue_door_1 in step 3, and then I go in front of it in step 8. However, since I toggled it to unlock it in step 3, it would still be unlocked in step 8, which is what the goal requires. 

There's another issue with this plan. Constraint 9 requires that before I go in front of blue_door_1, I need to either go in front of blue_ball_1 or have grey_ball_1 in room_2. In my plan, I go in front of blue_ball_1 in step 1, but that's before I toggle blue_door_1 in step 3. Since I go in front of blue_door_1 again in step 8, I need to make sure that constraint 9 is satisfied before that. So I need to ensure that either I go in front of blue_ball_1 or grey_ball_1 is in room_2 before step 8.

Actually, let's simplify this plan and avoid toggling blue_door_1 multiple times. Also, I need to be holding an object when I toggle blue_door_1 (constraint 2).

Here's a revised plan:

1. Starting in room_4, I need to get to room_1 (constraint 4). I'll go through room_2.
   - Gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_4
   - Pick grey_ball_1 room_4 (this satisfies constraint 11)
   - Goto door purple_door_2 room_4 room_2
   - Toggle purple_door_2 to unlock it
   - Goto room room_4 room_2 purple_door_2
   - Gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_2 (this satisfies part of constraint 9)
   - Gotoempty (this satisfies part of constraint 12)
   - Goto door purple_door_1 room_2 room_1
   - Toggle purple_door_1 to unlock it (this satisfies constraint 5)
   - Goto room room_2 room_1 purple_door_1

2. Now I'm in room_1. I'll drop grey_ball_1 and pick up grey_box_1.
   - Gotoempty
   - Drop grey_ball_1 room_1 (this satisfies constraint 6)
   - Gotoobject grey_box_1 room_1
   - Pick grey_box_1 room_1

3. I need to move grey_box_1 to room_3 (constraint 10).
   - Goto door green_door_1 room_1 room_3
   - Toggle green_door_1 to unlock it (this satisfies part of constraint 13)
   - Goto room room_1 room_3 green_door_1
   - Gotoempty
   - Drop grey_box_1 room_3 (this satisfies part of constraint 10)

4. I need to move green_box_1 to room_4 (constraint 7).
   - Gotoobject green_box_1 room_3
   - Pick green_box_1 room_3 (this satisfies constraint 5)
   - Goto door blue_door_1 room_3 room_4
   - Toggle blue_door_1 to unlock it (constraint 2 is satisfied because I'm holding green_box_1, and constraint 3 is now satisfied)
   - Goto room room_3 room_4 blue_door_1
   - Gotoempty
   - Drop green_box_1 room_4 (this satisfies constraint 7)

5. I need to move green_ball_1 to room_2 (constraint 12).
   - Goto door blue_door_1 room_4 room_3
   - Goto room room_4 room_3 blue_door_1
   - Gotoobject green_ball_1 room_3
   - Pick green_ball_1 room_3
   - Goto door green_door_1 room_3 room_1
   - Goto room room_3 room_1 green_door_1
   - Goto door purple_door_1 room_1 room_2
   - Goto room room_1 room_2 purple_door_1
   - Gotoempty
   - Drop green_ball_1 room_2 (this satisfies part of constraint 12)

6. I need to interact with purple_ball_1 (constraint 13).
   - Goto door purple_door_2 room_2 room_4
   - Goto room room_2 room_4 purple_door_2
   - Gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4
   - Pick purple_ball_1 room_4 (this satisfies part of constraint 13)
   - Gotoempty
   - Drop purple_ball_1 room_4

7. I need to go in front of blue_door_1 to achieve the goal.
   - Goto door blue_door_1 room_4 room_3 (this satisfies constraint 8)

Actually, I think I've been overcomplicating this. Let me simplify and make a very straightforward plan:

1. Starting in room_4, I need to get to room_2 to satisfy part of constraint 9.
   - Gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_4
   - Pick grey_ball_1 room_4 (this satisfies constraint 11)
   - Goto door purple_door_2 room_4 room_2
   - Toggle purple_door_2 to unlock it
   - Goto room room_4 room_2 purple_door_2
   - Gotoempty
   - Drop grey_ball_1 room_2 (this satisfies part of constraint 9)

2. Now I need to get to room_1 to satisfy constraint 4.
   - Goto door purple_door_1 room_2 room_1
   - Toggle purple_door_1 to unlock it (this satisfies constraint 5)
   - Goto room room_2 room_1 purple_door_1

3. Now I'm in room_1. I'll pick up grey_box_1.
   - Gotoobject grey_box_1 room_1
   - Pick grey_box_1 room_1

4. I need to move grey_box_1 to room_3 (constraint 10).
   - Goto door green_door_1 room_1 room_3
   - Toggle green_door_1 to unlock it (this satisfies part of constraint 13)
   - Goto room room_1 room_3 green_door_1
   - Gotoempty
   - Drop grey_box_1 room_3 (this satisfies part of constraint 10)

5. I need to move green_box_1 to room_4 (constraint 7).
   - Gotoobject green_box_1 room_3
   - Pick green_box_1 room_3 (this satisfies constraint 5)
   - Goto door blue_door_1 room_3 room_4
   - Toggle blue_door_1 to unlock it (constraint 2 is satisfied because I'm holding green_box_1, and constraint 3 is now satisfied)
   - Goto room room_3 room_4 blue_door_1
   - Gotoempty
   - Drop green_box_1 room_4 (this satisfies constraint 7)

6. I need to move grey_ball_1 to room_1 (constraint 6).
   - Goto door purple_door_2 room_4 room_2
   - Goto room room_4 room_2 purple_door_2
   - Gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_2
   - Pick grey_ball_1 room_2
   - Goto door purple_door_1 room_2 room_1
   - Goto room room_2 room_1 purple_door_1
   - Gotoempty
   - Drop grey_ball_1 room_1 (this satisfies constraint 6)

7. I need to satisfy constraint 12 (either move green_ball_1 to room_2 or go in front of an empty position).
   - Gotoempty (this satisfies part of constraint 12)

8. I need to satisfy constraint 13 (either pick up purple_ball_1 or go in front of green_door_1).
   - Goto door green_door_1 room_1 room_3 (this satisfies part of constraint 13)

9. I need to go in front of blue_door_1 to achieve the goal.
   - Goto room room_1 room_3 green_door_1
   - Goto door blue_door_1 room_3 room_4 (this satisfies constraint 8)

This plan seems to work, but I'll double-check to make sure I've satisfied all constraints.

Actually, I've been overthinking this. Let me make a simpler plan while ensuring that all constraints are met:

1. Starting in room_4, I need to get a clear constraint satisfaction path.
   - Gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_4
   - Pick grey_ball_1 room_4 (this satisfies constraint 11)
   - Gotoempty (this satisfies part of constraint 12)
   - Goto door purple_door_2 room_4 room_2
   - Toggle purple_door_2 to unlock it
   - Goto room room_4 room_2 purple_door_2
   - Gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_2 (this satisfies part of constraint 9)
   - Gotoempty
   - Drop grey_ball_1 room_2 (this satisfies part of constraint 9)
   - Goto door purple_door_1 room_2 room_1
   - Toggle purple_door_1 to unlock it (this satisfies constraint 5)
   - Goto room room_2 room_1 purple_door_1

2. Now I'm in room_1 (this satisfies constraint 4). I'll pick up grey_box_1.
   - Gotoobject grey_box_1 room_1
   - Pick grey_box_1 room_1
   - Goto door green_door_1 room_1 room_3
   - Toggle green_door_1 to unlock it (this satisfies part of constraint 13)
   - Goto room room_1 room_3 green_door_1
   - Gotoempty
   - Drop grey_box_1 room_3 (this satisfies part of constraint 10)

3. I need to move green_box_1 to room_4 (constraint 7).
   - Gotoobject green_box_1 room_3
   - Pick green_box_1 room_3 (this satisfies constraint 5)
   - Goto door blue_door_1 room_3 room_4
   - Toggle blue_door_1 to unlock it (constraint 2 is satisfied because I'm holding green_box_1, and constraint 3 is now satisfied)
   - Goto room room_3 room_4 blue_door_1
   - Gotoempty
   - Drop green_box_1 room_4 (this satisfies constraint 7)

4. I need to move grey_ball_1 to room_1 (constraint 6).
   - Goto door purple_door_2 room_4 room_2
   - Goto room room_4 room_2 purple_door_2
   - Gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_2
   - Pick grey_ball_1 room_2
   - Goto door purple_door_1 room_2 room_1
   - Goto room room_2 room_1 purple_door_1
   - Gotoempty
   - Drop grey_ball_1 room_1 (this satisfies constraint 6)

5. I need to satisfy constraint 13 (either pick up purple_ball_1 or go in front of green_door_1).
   - Goto door green_door_1 room_1 room_3 (this satisfies part of constraint 13)

6. I need to go in front of blue_door_1 to achieve the goal.
   - Goto room room_1 room_3 green_door_1
   - Goto door blue_door_1 room_3 room_4 (this satisfies constraint 8)

Alright, with the final plan I've outlined all actions and verified that all constraints have been met. However, let me do a final check of all the constraints to ensure I haven't missed anything:

1. blue_door_1 is locked - Satisfied in initial state
2. If blue_door_1 is locked, then you are holding some object - Satisfied because I'm holding green_box_1 when I toggle blue_door_1
3. blue_door_1 is not locked - Satisfied after I toggle blue_door_1
4. If blue_door_1 is not locked, there was an earlier state where you are in room_1 - Satisfied because I visit room_1 before I toggle blue_door_1
5. Either you are in front of purple_door_1 or you are holding green_box_1 - Satisfied because I pick up green_box_1
6. grey_ball_1 is in room_1 - Satisfied
7. green_box_1 is in room_4 - Satisfied
