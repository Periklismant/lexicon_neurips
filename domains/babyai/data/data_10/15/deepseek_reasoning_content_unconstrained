Okay, let's try to figure out this planning problem. The goal is to have a blue door that's unlocked, and I need to be in front of it. The constraints aren't listed here, but maybe they're part of the problem? Wait, the initial state says all doors are locked. So, first, I need to unlock a blue door. But there's only one blue door: blue_door_1 connects room_3 and room_4. 

Starting in room_4. So blue_door_1 is between room_3 and 4. To toggle it, I need to be in front of it. But to get there, I need to go to room_3 first. Wait, but blue_door_1 is locked. How do I get to room_3? The doors from room_4 to room_2 are purple_door_2, which is locked. The door to room_3 is blue_door_1, which is locked. So I can't go directly from room_4 to room_3 because the door is locked.

Hmm. Wait, the initial state says the agent is in room_4. The doors connected to room_4 are purple_door_2 (to room_2) and blue_door_1 (to room_3). Both are locked. So how can the agent move? Maybe there's an object blocking the doors? Wait, the preconditions for "goto door" require that there's no object blocking the position in front of the door. But in the initial state, are there any objects blocking doors? Let me check.

In room_4, the objects are purple_ball_1 and grey_ball_1. Are these blocking any doors? The problem statement doesn't mention objects blocking doors unless they are in front. But the initial state doesn't say any objects are blocking doors. So maybe the doors are accessible. Wait, but to go to a door, you need to be in a room that the door connects. So in room_4, the doors are purple_door_2 (connecting to room_2) and blue_door_1 (connecting to room_3). So the agent can go to either of those doors from room_4. But the doors are locked, so even if they go in front of the door, they can't go through. But the toggle action requires being in front of the door. So maybe the plan is:

1. Go to blue_door_1 from room_4 (since it's in room_4, connected to room_3). Wait, "gotodoor d r1 r2" requires that you are in a room connected by the door. So in room_4, the doors are purple_door_2 (to room_2) and blue_door_1 (to room_3). So from room_4, the agent can go to blue_door_1 (since it's connecting room_4 and room_3). So "gotodoor blue_door_1 room_4 room_3". Then "toggle blue_door_1" to unlock it. Then, after that, the door is unlocked. But the goal is to be in front of a blue door that's unlocked. So after toggling, blue_door_1 becomes unlocked. So then the agent is already in front of it, so that would satisfy the goal. Wait, but after the toggle, the door is unlocked, and the agent is in front of it. So the steps would be:

- goto door blue_door_1 room_4 room_3 (since agent is in room_4)
- toggle blue_door_1 (unlocks it)
Then, the goal is achieved: blue door, in front of it, and not locked.

But wait, the initial state says all doors are locked. So after toggling blue_door_1, it becomes unlocked. So that's the plan? But the agent starts in room_4. So first, the agent needs to go to the blue_door_1 in room_4. Then toggle it. That's two actions. But wait, the problem requires that the final state is that the agent is in front of the blue door, which is unlocked. So after the toggle, the door is unlocked, and the agent is still in front of it. So the plan would be:

1. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_4 room_3
2. toggle blue_door_1

Is that sufficient? Let me check the preconditions. For gotodoor: the agent must be in a room connected by the door (room_4 is connected via blue_door_1 to room_3). Also, no object is blocking the door's position in the current room (room_4). The initial state has purple_ball_1 and grey_ball_1 in room_4. Are they blocking the door? The problem states that objects can block a door if they are in front of it. But in the initial state, are any objects in front of doors? The initial state doesn't mention that, so perhaps the doors are not blocked. So the agent can go to the door.

So step 1: goto door blue_door_1 room_4 room_3. Then step 2: toggle blue_door_1. That unlocks it. Then the agent is in front of blue_door_1, which is now unlocked. That meets the goal. So that's two actions, which is optimal. But wait, the problem says to provide an optimal plan, i.e., the shortest possible. So this seems correct. Let me make sure there's no constraint I'm missing. The problem mentions constraints, but the user didn't list them here. Wait, the original problem says "A valid plan for the abovementioned problem must abide by the following constraints:" but then there's nothing. Maybe that's a formatting error. But assuming there are no additional constraints, this plan should work.

But let me double-check. The goal is: There exists a door d such that d is blue, you are in front of d, and d is not locked. So blue_door_1 is blue. After the toggle, it's unlocked. And after the gotodoor action, the agent is in front of it. The toggle action's effect is to unlock it. So after step 2, all three conditions are met. So yes, this should work. So the plan is:

```
gotodoor blue_door_1 room_4 room_3
toggle blue_door_1
```

But wait, the gotodoor action's arguments are d, r1, r2. The syntax is "gotodoor d r1 r2". So the correct command would be "gotodoor blue_door_1 room_4 room_3" because the door connects room_4 and room_3. Then the toggle. That's two steps. That's the shortest possible plan. So that's the answer.
