Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. Hmm, the goal is to be in front of a blue door that's unlocked. The blue door in the setup is blue_door_1, which connects room_4 and room_3. But initially, all doors are locked. So I need to unlock blue_door_1. But to toggle a door, I need to be in front of it. Also, the constraints add a bunch of conditions that must be met during the plan. Let me list out the constraints first to make sure I don't miss any.

Constraints:
1. At some state, blue_door_1 is locked. Well, initially it's locked, so that's covered.
2. If blue_door_1 is locked in a state, then in that state or a later one, I must be holding something. But since the initial state has it locked, I need to ensure I pick up something at some point after.
3. At some state, blue_door_1 is not locked. That's the goal, so that's covered once I unlock it.
4. If blue_door_1 is unlocked in a state, there must be an earlier state where I was in room_1. So I need to visit room_1 before unlocking blue_door_1.
5. At some state, either in front of purple_door_1 or holding green_box_1.
6. At some state, grey_ball_1 is in room_1.
7. At some state, green_box_1 is in room_4.
8. At some state, in front of blue_door_1. Which is part of the goal.
9. If in front of blue_door_1, then earlier state must have either been in front of blue_ball_1 or grey_ball_1 in room_2.
10. At some state, either grey_box_1 in room_3 or green_ball_1 in room_1.
11. At some state, holding some object. That's covered by the second constraint as well.
12. At some state, green_ball_1 in room_2 or in front of empty.
13. At some state, holding purple_ball_1 or in front of green_door_1.

So, the main steps would involve moving to room_1, then moving through rooms to unlock doors as needed, maybe moving objects to satisfy constraints, then getting to blue_door_1 and unlocking it. But let's break it down.

Starting in room_4. The goal is to be in front of blue_door_1 (which is in room_4, connecting to room_3) and have it unlocked. But first, I need to visit room_1 because constraint 4 says that before unlocking blue_door_1, I must have been in room_1. So I need to go from room_4 to room_1. How?

The doors are all locked. So I need to unlock doors along the way. Let's see the connections. From room_4, doors are purple_door_2 (connects to room_2) and blue_door_1 (connects to room_3). But blue_door_1 is locked. So from room_4, maybe go to room_2 via purple_door_2. But purple_door_2 is also locked. To unlock a door, I need to be in front of it and toggle it. But to get in front of purple_door_2 in room_4, I need to goto door purple_door_2 room_4 room_2. But that requires that there's no object blocking the position in front of the door. Are there any objects in front of doors? The initial state doesn't mention any objects blocking doors. Wait, the initial state lists objects in rooms but not their positions. The problem says that going to a door is possible if no object is blocking that position. Assuming that doors are not blocked unless an object is in front. Since the initial state doesn't mention any object being in front of a door, maybe we can go to doors directly.

So starting in room_4:

1. Gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_2 (but door is locked)
2. Toggle purple_door_2 to unlock it. But to toggle, need to be in front of it. So step 1: gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_2. Then toggle. Then go through to room_2.

But wait, after unlocking purple_door_2, we can go to room_2. Then from room_2, we can go to room_1 via purple_door_1 (which is locked). So need to unlock that as well. Let's outline the steps:

Current location: room_4.

Action 1: gotodoor purple_door_2 room4 room2. (Possible if in room4 and door connects to room2. Check. No object blocking. So yes.)

Action 2: toggle purple_door_2. Now it's unlocked.

Action 3: gotoroom room4 room2 purple_door_2. Now in room2.

Now in room2. Need to get to room1 via purple_door_1. But purple_door_1 is locked. So:

Action 4: gotodoor purple_door_1 room2 room1.

Action5: toggle purple_door_1. Unlock it.

Action6: gotoroom room2 room1 purple_door_1. Now in room1.

This satisfies constraint4 (visited room1 before unlocking blue_door_1). But wait, the goal is to unlock blue_door_1, which is in room4. So after getting to room1, how do I get back to room4? Let's see. From room1, can go to room3 via green_door_1 (which is locked). Need to unlock green_door_1. But green_door_1 connects room1 and room3. So steps from room1:

Action7: gotodoor green_door_1 room1 room3.

Action8: toggle green_door_1. Now unlocked.

Action9: gotoroom room1 room3 green_door_1. Now in room3.

In room3, blue_box_1, green_ball_1, green_box_1 are here. Then from room3, can go to room4 via blue_door_1 (which is locked). But blue_door_1 is in room3 and room4. To unlock blue_door_1, need to be in front of it. So in room3:

Action10: gotodoor blue_door_1 room3 room4.

Action11: toggle blue_door_1. Unlock it.

But wait, but the goal is to have blue_door_1 unlocked and be in front of it. So maybe after unlocking it, I can be in front of it. But the toggle action would have been done when in front of it. But after unlocking, the door is unlocked, and then I can go through it. Wait, but the goal is to be in front of blue_door_1 when it's unlocked. So perhaps after unlocking it, I need to still be in front of it. So maybe the toggle action is done while in front of it, and then that satisfies the goal. Wait, the goal is "there exists a door d such that d is blue, you are in front of d, and d is not locked". So blue_door_1 is the only blue door. So the final state must have me in front of blue_door_1, which is unlocked.

So the plan must end with being in front of blue_door_1 and having it unlocked. So after unlocking it, I need to be in front of it. But when you toggle a door, you are in front of it. So if I toggle it from locked to unlocked, then after that action, I'm still in front of it, and it's unlocked. So that would satisfy the goal. Therefore, the final action should be toggle blue_door_1, but wait, no. Toggle changes the state. Initially, blue_door_1 is locked. So toggle would unlock it. So after toggle, it's unlocked, and I'm in front of it. So that would satisfy the goal. But wait, the toggle action's effect is that if it was locked, it becomes unlocked. So after performing toggle on blue_door_1, the door is unlocked, and the agent is still in front of it. So the final state after toggle would satisfy the goal. But let's check the preconditions for toggle: must be in front of the door. So the steps would be: gotodoor blue_door_1, then toggle. Then done.

But how do I get to blue_door_1? Let's backtrack.

Starting in room4, need to reach blue_door_1 in room4. Wait, blue_door_1 connects room4 and room3. So in room4, blue_door_1 is present. So from room4, can I go to the door blue_door_1? Yes. But initially, all doors are locked. So to get to blue_door_1's position in room4, I can use gotodoor blue_door_1 room4 room3. But the door is locked. Wait, but gotodoor's precondition is that you are in a room connected by the door, and no object is blocking the position. Assuming that's possible. Then:

From room4, gotodoor blue_door_1 room4 room3. Then toggle to unlock. Then the goal is achieved. But that's a very short plan, but let's check the constraints.

But the constraints require several things. For example, constraint4 says that if blue_door_1 is not locked (which it would be after toggle), then there must be an earlier state where I was in room_1. So in this case, if I just go to blue_door_1 and toggle it, I haven't visited room_1. So that plan would fail constraint4. Therefore, I must visit room_1 before unlocking blue_door_1.

So the previous steps where I went from room4 to room2, then to room1, then to room3, then to room4, etc., but how to get back to room4. Let's see.

Alternative path:

Start in room4. Need to go to room1. The path would be room4 -> room2 via purple_door_2 (unlock), then room2 -> room1 via purple_door_1 (unlock), then room1 -> room3 via green_door_1 (unlock), then room3 -> room4 via blue_door_1 (unlock). But during this, when do I visit room1?

So steps:

1. From room4, go to purple_door_2 (gotodoor), toggle to unlock, then goto room2.

2. In room2, go to purple_door_1, toggle to unlock, goto room1.

3. Now in room1. Need to unlock green_door_1 to get to room3. So goto green_door_1 in room1, toggle to unlock, goto room3.

4. In room3, goto blue_door_1, toggle to unlock. Now, blue_door_1 is unlocked, and you are in front of it. But you are in room3. Wait, the door connects room3 and room4. So in room3, the door blue_door_1 is present. So when you goto door blue_door_1 in room3, then toggle it. After that, you're in front of blue_door_1 in room3. But the goal requires that you are in front of a blue door (blue_door_1) which is unlocked. So if you're in room3, in front of blue_door_1, and it's unlocked, that satisfies the goal. But the initial position is in room4, but after moving to room3, you can be in front of blue_door_1 there. But the problem states that the final goal is "There is a door d such that d is blue, you are in front of d, d is not locked". So as long as you are in front of blue_door_1 (either from room3 or room4 side) and it's unlocked, that's okay. However, the initial state says you're in room4, and blue_door_1 connects room4 and room3. So to be in front of blue_door_1, you can be in either room4 or room3. But after toggling it from room3, you're in front of it in room3, and it's unlocked. So that would satisfy the goal. However, the problem's constraints require that when you are in front of blue_door_1, you must have been in front of blue_ball_1 or grey_ball_1 is in room2 in an earlier state. Let's check that.

Constraint9 says: If you are in front of blue_door_1 in some state, then earlier state must have either been in front of blue_ball_1 or grey_ball_1 is in room2. So in this path, when you are in front of blue_door_1 (in room3), you need to have met that condition. Let's see: blue_ball_1 is in room2 initially. So if during the plan, grey_ball_1 is moved to room2, or you were in front of blue_ball_1. In the current plan, when you go to room2 (step 1-2), you could potentially gotoobject blue_ball_1 in room2. Let's see. Let's retrace:

After step2, you are in room2. blue_ball_1 is there. So maybe in room2, you can gotoobject blue_ball_1, then pick it up, but that might not be necessary. However, constraint9 requires that before being in front of blue_door_1, either you were in front of blue_ball_1 or grey_ball_1 is in room2. The initial state has grey_ball_1 in room4. So unless we move it to room2, we need to have been in front of blue_ball_1. So during the plan, when in room2, if you go to blue_ball_1, then that satisfies the condition.

So steps:

After step2 (in room2), do:

Action: gotoobject blue_ball_1 room2. Then you are in front of it. Then proceed. But this would satisfy the condition for constraint9, because when later you are in front of blue_door_1, you had an earlier state where you were in front of blue_ball_1. So that's covered.

So inserting that step:

After step2 (gotoroom room4 to room2), then:

Action3: gotoobject blue_ball_1 room2.

Then proceed to purple_door_1.

But this might complicate the plan. Let's see.

Alternatively, during the plan, moving grey_ball_1 to room2. But that requires picking it up from room4, then dropping it in room2. But the initial position is room4, grey_ball_1 is in room4. So maybe:

In room4, gotoobject grey_ball_1, pick it up, then go to room2 via purple_door_2, drop it in room2. Then proceed. That would satisfy the grey_ball_1 in room2 condition, which would also satisfy constraint9 when you are in front of blue_door_1.

But this adds steps, which might make the plan longer. But the problem requires an optimal plan (shortest possible). So which path is shorter?

Let's compare:

Option 1: When in room2, goto blue_ball_1 (step3), then continue. This adds 1 step (gotoobject), but no pickup.

But constraint9 requires that in the state where you are in front of blue_door_1, there's an earlier state where you were in front of blue_ball_1 or grey_ball_1 is in room2. If you just go in front of blue_ball_1 in room2, then that's enough. So no need to pick it up. So adding that step would satisfy the constraint.

So in this case, the plan would be:

1. gotodoor purple_door_2 room4 room2

2. toggle purple_door_2

3. gotoroom room4 room2 purple_door_2

4. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room2

5. gotodoor purple_door_1 room2 room1

6. toggle purple_door_1

7. gotoroom room2 room1 purple_door_1

8. gotodoor green_door_1 room1 room3

9. toggle green_door_1

10. gotoroom room1 room3 green_door_1

11. gotodoor blue_door_1 room3 room4

12. toggle blue_door_1

Now, after step12, you are in front of blue_door_1 (in room3), which is now unlocked. This meets the goal. Let's check the constraints:

Constraint1: blue_door_1 is locked in some state. Initial state has it locked. Check.

Constraint2: if blue_door_1 was locked, then at that state or after, hold something. But in the initial state, it's locked, and we don't hold anything. So we need to pick up something after the initial state. Wait, but in the current plan, we never pick up anything. That violates constraint2. Because in the initial state, blue_door_1 is locked. So constraint2 requires that in that state (initial) or later, we hold something. But in the plan above, we never pick up anything. So this plan is invalid. So we need to include picking up an object at some point.

Ah, right! So constraint2 says that if blue_door_1 is locked in some state s (like the initial state), then in s or a later state, we must be holding an object. So in the initial state, blue_door_1 is locked. So we need to hold an object at some point after that. Therefore, the plan must include picking up an object.

So the plan must include a pick action. Let's see. Which object? Maybe the purple_ball_1 in room4. Because we start in room4. So steps:

In room4, gotoobject purple_ball_1 room4, pick it up. Then proceed.

But then, after picking it up, we need to carry it, which might affect other steps. But let's adjust the plan.

So revised steps:

1. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room4

2. pick purple_ball_1 room4

3. gotodoor purple_door_2 room4 room2

4. toggle purple_door_2

5. gotoroom room4 room2 purple_door_2

6. drop purple_ball_1 room2 (to free hands for other actions? But maybe not necessary. Alternatively, hold it until needed.)

But dropping would require being in front of an empty spot. Or, perhaps not necessary to drop. But holding an object meets constraint2 and constraint11 (must hold some object at some state). So if we pick up purple_ball_1 in room4, that satisfies constraint11 and constraint2.

So inserting steps:

1. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room4

2. pick purple_ball_1 room4

Then proceed to go to purple_door_2, etc. But when you pick up an object, you are no longer in front of it, and your hands are full. So when you goto door or other rooms, you can still move, but you need to carry the object.

But when moving through doors, you can carry the object. So after picking up purple_ball_1, the steps would be:

3. gotodoor purple_door_2 room4 room2

4. toggle purple_door_2 (unlock)

5. gotoroom room4 room2 purple_door_2 (now in room2, carrying purple_ball_1)

6. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room2 (to satisfy constraint9's requirement when later in front of blue_door_1)

7. gotodoor purple_door_1 room2 room1

8. toggle purple_door_1 (unlock)

9. gotoroom room2 room1 purple_door_1 (now in room1, carrying purple_ball_1)

10. gotodoor green_door_1 room1 room3

11. toggle green_door_1 (unlock)

12. gotoroom room1 room3 green_door_1 (now in room3, carrying purple_ball_1)

13. gotodoor blue_door_1 room3 room4

14. toggle blue_door_1 (unlock it; now in front of blue_door_1, unlocked)

But now, constraint13 requires that at some state, either holding purple_ball_1 or in front of green_door_1. Since we are holding purple_ball_1 from step2 onwards until maybe dropping it, this is satisfied. So in multiple states, we are holding purple_ball_1, which covers constraint13.

Also, constraint5 requires that at some state, either in front of purple_door_1 or holding green_box_1. In this plan, when we toggled purple_door_1 (step8), we were in front of it. So that covers constraint5.

Constraint6: grey_ball_1 must be in room_1 at some state. Initially, grey_ball_1 is in room4. So we need to move it to room1. But in this current plan, we haven't done that. So this is a problem. So we need to include steps to move grey_ball_1 to room1.

So how to do that. Starting in room4, grey_ball_1 is there. So steps:

After step2 (pick purple_ball_1), perhaps we need to pick up grey_ball_1 as well. But we can only carry one object at a time. So perhaps:

But wait, after step2, we are holding purple_ball_1. To pick up grey_ball_1, we need to drop purple_ball_1 first. But that adds steps. Alternatively, maybe after moving to room1, we can go back to room4 to get grey_ball_1. But that would make the plan longer.

Alternatively, maybe after reaching room1, go back to room4 via the same path, but that's complicated. Let's think.

Alternatively, maybe use another object. For example, green_box_1 is in room3. The constraint7 requires that green_box_1 is in room4 at some state. So need to move green_box_1 from room3 to room4. How?

If we go to room3, pick up green_box_1, take it to room4. Then drop it. But when we are in room3 (step12), after arriving there, we can:

13. gotoobject green_box_1 room3

14. pick green_box_1 room3 (but we are holding purple_ball_1, so need to drop it first. Or maybe not. Wait, when you pick an object, you must not be holding anything. So to pick up green_box_1, we need to drop purple_ball_1 first.

So steps:

After step12 (in room3, holding purple_ball_1):

13. gotoempty (in room3)

14. drop purple_ball_1 room3

15. gotoobject green_box_1 room3

16. pick green_box_1 room3

17. gotodoor blue_door_1 room3 room4

18. toggle blue_door_1 (unlock)

19. gotoroom room3 room4 blue_door_1 (now in room4, holding green_box_1)

20. drop green_box_1 room4 (to satisfy constraint7)

But this adds several steps. Also, constraint10 requires that at some state, either grey_box_1 is in room3 or green_ball_1 is in room1. grey_box_1 is initially in room1. So to satisfy constraint10, either move grey_box_1 to room3 or move green_ball_1 to room1. green_ball_1 is in room3. So maybe during the plan, move green_ball_1 to room1. But that requires picking it up in room3 and carrying it to room1. That would add steps.

This is getting complicated. Let's try to outline all constraints and see which ones are not yet covered:

Constraints to cover:

5. At least once: in front of purple_door_1 or holding green_box_1. Covered by step8 (in front of purple_door_1).

6. grey_ball_1 in room1. Need to move it there.

7. green_box_1 in room4. Need to move it there.

10. grey_box_1 in room3 or green_ball_1 in room1. Either move grey_box_1 to room3 or green_ball_1 to room1.

Let's tackle constraint6: grey_ball_1 must be in room1. To do that, we need to pick it up from room4 and drop it in room1. So steps:

Starting in room4, after step2 (holding purple_ball_1):

3. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room4. But wait, we are already holding purple_ball_1. To pick up grey_ball_1, need to drop purple_ball_1 first. So:

3. gotoempty room4

4. drop purple_ball_1 room4

5. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room4

6. pick grey_ball_1 room4

Then proceed to move to room2, etc. But this adds steps.

But this would allow us to carry grey_ball_1 to room1. Then drop it there.

So revised steps:

1. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room4

2. pick purple_ball_1 room4

3. gotoempty room4

4. drop purple_ball_1 room4

5. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room4

6. pick grey_ball_1 room4

7. gotodoor purple_door_2 room4 room2

8. toggle purple_door_2

9. gotoroom room4 room2 purple_door_2

10. gotodoor purple_door_1 room2 room1

11. toggle purple_door_1

12. gotoroom room2 room1 purple_door_1

13. drop grey_ball_1 room1 (satisfies constraint6)

14. gotoobject green_box_1 room3 (but we are in room1. So need to go to room3 first.)

Wait, after dropping grey_ball_1 in room1, we need to proceed to room3. But we are in room1. So:

14. gotodoor green_door_1 room1 room3

15. toggle green_door_1

16. gotoroom room1 room3 green_door_1

17. gotoobject green_box_1 room3

18. pick green_box_1 room3

19. gotodoor blue_door_1 room3 room4

20. toggle blue_door_1

21. gotoroom room3 room4 blue_door_1

22. drop green_box_1 room4 (satisfies constraint7)

23. gotodoor blue_door_1 room4 room3

24. toggle blue_door_1 (to unlock it again? But initially it was locked, after step20 it's unlocked. So toggling again would lock it. Wait no: initial state: blue_door_1 is locked. Step20 toggles it to unlocked. Then step24 would toggle it back to locked. But we need it to be unlocked in the final state. So this is a problem. So after step20, blue_door_1 is unlocked. Then when we go to room4 via blue_door_1 (step21), then in step23, goto door blue_door_1 in room4, which is possible. Then toggle it again would lock it, which is bad.

Wait, the goal is to have blue_door_1 unlocked and in front of it. So after step20, we are in front of blue_door_1 in room3, and it's unlocked. That satisfies the goal. But then why move to room4? Maybe after step20, that's the final step. So maybe the plan ends there. Let me check:

After step20: toggle blue_door_1 (unlocked), and you are in front of it in room3. So the goal is achieved. But then, the other constraints:

constraint8: when you are in front of blue_door_1 (step20), there must be an earlier state where you were in front of blue_ball_1 or grey_ball_1 is in room2. Earlier steps: we moved grey_ball_1 to room1 (step13), so grey_ball_1 is in room1, not room2. But in step9, after arriving in room2, did we go in front of blue_ball_1? No. So in this plan, we have not satisfied constraint9. Because when we are in front of blue_door_1 (step20), there is no earlier state where we were in front of blue_ball_1 or grey_ball_1 is in room2. So this plan is invalid.

So we need to ensure that before step20, we either went in front of blue_ball_1 or moved grey_ball_1 to room2.

In this current plan, grey_ball_1 is in room1 (step13). So the only way to satisfy constraint9 is to have been in front of blue_ball_1. So during the plan, when in room2 (step9), we need to goto blue_ball_1.

So inserting that:

After step9 (in room2):

10. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room2

11. gotodoor purple_door_1 room2 room1

12. toggle purple_door_1

13. gotoroom room2 room1 purple_door_1

... and so on.

So adding step10: gotoobject blue_ball_1 room2.

This would satisfy constraint9 because when later in step20 (in front of blue_door_1), we have an earlier state (step10) where we were in front of blue_ball_1.

So revised steps:

1. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room4

2. pick purple_ball_1 room4

3. gotoempty room4

4. drop purple_ball_1 room4

5. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room4

6. pick grey_ball_1 room4

7. gotodoor purple_door_2 room4 room2

8. toggle purple_door_2

9. gotoroom room4 room2 purple_door_2

10. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room2 (satisfy constraint9)

11. gotodoor purple_door_1 room2 room1

12. toggle purple_door_1

13. gotoroom room2 room1 purple_door_1

14. drop grey_ball_1 room1 (satisfy constraint6)

15. gotodoor green_door_1 room1 room3

16. toggle green_door_1

17. gotoroom room1 room3 green_door_1

18. gotoobject green_box_1 room3

19. pick green_box_1 room3

20. gotodoor blue_door_1 room3 room4

21. toggle blue_door_1 (now unlocked, in front of it in room3. Goal achieved.)

Now, check constraints:

constraint1: blue_door_1 was locked initially. Check.

constraint2: initial state blue_door_1 locked, and later steps (steps2,5,19) we hold objects. So in step2, after picking purple_ball_1, we are holding it. So constraint2 is satisfied.

constraint3: blue_door_1 is unlocked at step21. Check.

constraint4: before unlocking blue_door_1 (step21), we were in room1 (step13-14). Check.

constraint5: in step12, we were in front of purple_door_1. Check.

constraint6: grey_ball_1 in room1 (step14). Check.

constraint7: green_box_1 is in room3 (step18-19) and later moved to room4? No, in this plan, after step19, we pick green_box_1 and take it to room4. Wait, steps19-21:

19. pick green_box_1 room3.

20. gotodoor blue_door_1 room3 room4.

21. toggle blue_door_1 (unlock). Now, in front of blue_door_1 in room3, holding green_box_1.

Then, need to go to room4 and drop it.

22. gotoroom room3 room4 blue_door_1.

23. drop green_box_1 room4.

Then, the final steps would require going back to blue_door_1 in room4 and toggling it, but that would lock it again. Alternatively, after step21, can we drop the box in room4?

Wait, after step21, we are in front of blue_door_1 in room3. To drop green_box_1 in room4, we need to go to room4. So after step21:

22. gotoroom room3 room4 blue_door_1 (now in room4, holding green_box_1).

23. drop green_box_1 room4 (satisfies constraint7).

24. gotodoor blue_door_1 room4 room3.

25. toggle blue_door_1 (but this would lock it again. So the final state would have it locked, which is bad.)

So perhaps after step23, we need to go back to blue_door_1 and unlock it again. But that's adding steps. Alternatively, after step21, we are in front of blue_door_1 (in room3) and it's unlocked. That satisfies the goal. Then, the green_box_1 is still in room3 (step19: picked it up, then step21: still holding it). So to drop it in room4, need to go to room4:

21. toggle blue_door_1 (unlock, in front of it in room3)

22. gotoroom room3 room4 blue_door_1 (now in room4, holding green_box_1)

23. drop green_box_1 room4 (constraint7)

24. gotodoor blue_door_1 room4 room3

25. toggle blue_door_1 (unlock again? It was already unlocked. Toggling would lock it.)

So this is a problem. To keep blue_door_1 unlocked, the toggle in step21 must be the only one. So the plan must end with step21, but then green_box_1 is in room3 (not room4), violating constraint7.

Alternatively, after step19 (picking green_box_1 in room3), go to room4 via blue_door_1 (which is locked initially, so need to unlock it first). Wait, but in this plan, step21 is when we unlock blue_door_1. So steps:

19. pick green_box_1 room3.

20. gotodoor blue_door_1 room3 room4.

21. toggle blue_door_1 (unlock).

22. gotoroom room3 room4 blue_door_1 (now in room4).

23. drop green_box_1 room4 (satisfies constraint7).

Now, we are in room4. To be in front of blue_door_1 again, need to goto door blue_door_1 room4 room3.

24. gotodoor blue_door_1 room4 room3.

25. toggle blue_door_1 (lock it again? No, we need it to be unlocked. So this is bad.)

But the goal is to have blue_door_1 unlocked and be in front of it. So after step21, when we are in front of blue_door_1 in room3, it's unlocked. That's the goal. But then, green_box_1 is still in room3 (carried by us). To drop it in room4, we need to go to room4, but after that, we are no longer in front of blue_door_1. So the final state would have green_box_1 in room4 (constraint7 satisfied), but the agent is in room4, not in front of blue_door_1. So the goal would not be met.

So the only way to satisfy both the goal and constraint7 is to have the final action be toggle blue_door_1 (unlocking it) while in front of it, and have green_box_1 in room4 earlier.

But how? Let's try:

After step23 (drop green_box_1 in room4), then go back to blue_door_1 in room4:

24. gotodoor blue_door_1 room4 room3

25. toggle blue_door_1 (unlock it, but it was already unlocked, so toggling would lock it. No good.)

So this approach isn't working. Alternative idea: after step19 (pick green_box_1 in room3), go to room4 via blue_door_1, but that requires unlocking it first. So:

19. pick green_box_1 room3.

20. gotodoor blue_door_1 room3 room4.

21. toggle blue_door_1 (unlock).

22. gotoroom room3 room4 blue_door_1.

23. drop green_box_1 room4 (constraint7).

24. gotodoor blue_door_1 room4 room3.

25. toggle blue_door_1 (lock again? No. But the goal requires it to be unlocked. So after step21, blue_door_1 is unlocked. Then step25 would lock it again, which is bad.

Thus, the only way to have blue_door_1 unlocked and in front of it is to end the plan at step21. But then green_box_1 is still in room3 (carried), which violates constraint7. So we need to drop it in room4 before step21. But that requires going to room4, which requires unlocking blue_door_1, which is done in step21. So a chicken-and-egg problem.

Alternative plan: Maybe move green_box_1 to room4 before unlocking blue_door_1. But how? Because blue_door_1 is locked until step21.

Wait, in step17, we are in room3. green_box_1 is in room3. So:

17. gotoroom room1 room3 green_door_1.

18. gotoobject green_box_1 room3.

19. pick green_box_1 room3.

20. gotodoor blue_door_1 room3 room4.

21. toggle blue_door_1 (unlock).

22. gotoroom room3 room4 blue_door_1 (now in room4).

23. drop green_box_1 room4 (constraint7).

24. gotodoor blue_door_1 room4 room3.

25. toggle blue_door_1 (unlock again? No, it's already unlocked. So toggling locks it.)

No, this isn't working.

Alternatively, after step23, we need to be in front of blue_door_1 in room4. So:

24. gotodoor blue_door_1 room4 room3.

25. toggle blue_door_1 (locks it, which is bad).

Thus, this path is not feasible.

Alternative approach: Don't move green_box_1 to room4. Instead, satisfy constraint10 (grey_box_1 in room3 or green_ball_1 in room1). grey_box_1 is initially in room1. So grey_box_1 is already in room1, which is one of the options. So constraint10 is satisfied without any action. Because the initial state has grey_box_1 in room1. So constraint10 is satisfied. So no need to move green_ball_1. Wait, the initial state says:

Original state:

- grey_box_1 is in room_1

So constraint10 is: "grey_box_1 is in room3 or green_ball_1 is in room1". Since grey_box_1 is in room1 (not room3), but the condition is OR, so if grey_box_1 is in room3 OR green_ball_1 is in room1. But grey_box_1 is in room1, so the condition is not satisfied. Because the condition is grey_box_1 in room3 OR green_ball_1 in room1. Initially, neither is true. So we need to make one of them true. So either move grey_box_1 to room3 or green_ball_1 to room1.

Ah, right! The initial state of grey_box_1 is in room1. So to satisfy constraint10, we need to have either grey_box_1 in room3 or green_ball_1 in room1. So in the plan, we must move either grey_box_1 to room3 or green_ball_1 to room1.

Thus, in our current plan, we have not addressed constraint10. So we need to include steps to move either grey_box_1 or green_ball_1.

grey_box_1 is in room1. To move it to room3, we need to pick it up in room1 and carry it to room3. So steps:

After step14 (drop grey_ball_1 in room1), pick up grey_box_1 in room1 and take it to room3.

So steps:

15. gotoobject grey_box_1 room1

16. pick grey_box_1 room1

17. gotodoor green_door_1 room1 room3

18. toggle green_door_1 (already unlocked from step16?)

Wait, in previous steps, after step16: toggle green_door_1 was step16? Let me check:

Current plan steps up to 14:

1. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room4

2. pick purple_ball_1 room4

3. gotoempty room4

4. drop purple_ball_1 room4

5. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room4

6. pick grey_ball_1 room4

7. gotodoor purple_door_2 room4 room2

8. toggle purple_door_2

9. gotoroom room4 room2 purple_door_2

10. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room2

11. gotodoor purple_door_1 room2 room1

12. toggle purple_door_1

13. gotoroom room2 room1 purple_door_1

14. drop grey_ball_1 room1

15. gotoobject grey_box_1 room1

16. pick grey_box_1 room1

17. gotodoor green_door_1 room1 room3

18. toggle green_door_1 (unlock, but initially it's locked. Wait, in step17, green_door_1 is connecting room1 and room3. Initially locked. So need to toggle it to unlock.

But in step17, when we gotodoor green_door_1 room1 room3, then toggle it (step18).

Then, proceed to room3:

19. gotoroom room1 room3 green_door_1

20. drop grey_box_1 room3 (satisfies constraint10: grey_box_1 in room3)

21. gotoobject green_box_1 room3

22. pick green_box_1 room3

23. gotodoor blue_door_1 room3 room4

24. toggle blue_door_1 (unlock)

25. gotoroom room3 room4 blue_door_1

26. drop green_box_1 room4 (satisfies constraint7)

But now, after step24, we are in front of blue_door_1 in room3, it's unlocked. So goal achieved. Then steps25-26 are to drop green_box_1 in room4. But after step24, the goal is already met. However, the problem requires the final state to meet the goal. But the plan's actions must end when the goal is achieved. However, in this case, after step24, the goal is achieved. Steps25-26 are additional and may not be needed, but the plan must include them to satisfy constraint7. But this makes the plan longer. However, the problem requires an optimal (shortest) plan, so perhaps there's a shorter way.

Alternatively, after step24, the plan could end, but then constraint7 (green_box_1 in room4) is not satisfied. So we must include steps to move green_box_1 to room4.

But this is getting very long. Let's count the steps:

Current steps up to 26:

1. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room4

2. pick purple_ball_1 room4

3. gotoempty room4

4. drop purple_ball_1 room4

5. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room4

6. pick grey_ball_1 room4

7. gotodoor purple_door_2 room4 room2

8. toggle purple_door_2

9. gotoroom room4 room2 purple_door_2

10. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room2

11. gotodoor purple_door_1 room2 room1

12. toggle purple_door_1

13. gotoroom room2 room1 purple_door_1

14. drop grey_ball_1 room1

15. gotoobject grey_box_1 room1

16. pick grey_box_1 room1

17. gotodoor green_door_1 room1 room3

18. toggle green_door_1

19. gotoroom room1 room3 green_door_1

20. drop grey_box_1 room3

21. gotoobject green_box_1 room3

22. pick green_box_1 room3

23. gotodoor blue_door_1 room3 room4

24. toggle blue_door_1

25. gotoroom room3 room4 blue_door_1

26. drop green_box_1 room4

27. gotodoor blue_door_1 room4 room3

28. toggle blue_door_1 (locks it again)

But step28 is bad. So after step24, the goal is met, but the plan must continue to step26 to satisfy constraint7. However, step26 requires being in room4, which is done via step25. After step26, we are in room4. To be in front of blue_door_1 again, we need to goto door blue_door_1 room4 room3 and toggle it, but that would lock it.

This is not acceptable. So the only way to have the goal met is to end the plan at step24. But then, green_box_1 is in room3 (carried), so constraint7 is not met. Thus, this approach is not working.

Alternative idea: Instead of moving green_box_1 to room4, move green_ball_1 to room1 to satisfy constraint10. This would require:

After step19 (in room3), pick green_ball_1 and move it to room1.

But how? Let's see:

After step19 (gotoroom room1 to room3 via green_door_1), we can:

20. gotoobject green_ball_1 room3

21. pick green_ball_1 room3

22. gotodoor green_door_1 room3 room1

23. gotoroom room3 room1 green_door_1

24. drop green_ball_1 room1 (satisfies constraint10: green_ball_1 in room1)

Then proceed to handle green_box_1:

25. gotoroom room1 room3 green_door_1

26. gotoobject green_box_1 room3

27. pick green_box_1 room3

28. gotodoor blue_door_1 room3 room4

29. toggle blue_door_1

30. gotoroom room3 room4 blue_door_1

31. drop green_box_1 room4

But again, this adds many steps. And the goal is achieved at step29, but need to proceed to step31 to satisfy constraint7.

This is getting too long. Perhaps there's a more optimal path.

Alternative approach: Use the green_box_1 in room3. Since constraint7 requires green_box_1 to be in room4 at some state, we need to move it. Also, constraint5 requires either in front of purple_door_1 or holding green_box_1. So if we hold green_box_1, that satisfies constraint5. So instead of going to purple_door_1, we can hold green_box_1. So maybe pick up green_box_1 and carry it, which satisfies constraint5 without needing to go to purple_door_1.

Let's try this path:

Start in room4.

1. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room4

2. pick purple_ball_1 room4 (constraint2 and 11 satisfied)

3. gotodoor purple_door_2 room4 room2

4. toggle purple_door_2

5. gotoroom room4 room2 purple_door_2

6. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room2 (satisfy constraint9)

7. gotodoor purple_door_1 room2 room1

8. toggle purple_door_1

9. gotoroom room2 room1 purple_door_1 (now in room1, satisfy constraint4)

10. gotodoor green_door_1 room1 room3

11. toggle green_door_1

12. gotoroom room1 room3 green_door_1

13. gotoobject green_box_1 room3

14. pick green_box_1 room3 (now holding green_box_1, satisfying constraint5)

15. gotodoor blue_door_1 room3 room4

16. toggle blue_door_1 (unlock, now in front of it. Goal achieved.)

But also need to satisfy other constraints:

constraint6: grey_ball_1 in room1. Not addressed. So need to move grey_ball_1 from room4 to room1.

constraint7: green_box_1 in room4. Currently, after step14, we are holding green_box_1 in room3. Then step15: gotodoor blue_door_1. Step16: toggle. So to move green_box_1 to room4, after step16:

17. gotoroom room3 room4 blue_door_1

18. drop green_box_1 room4 (satisfies constraint7)

But then, after step18, we are in room4. To be in front of blue_door_1 again, need to goto it and toggle, which may lock it.

But the goal is already achieved at step16. However, the drop in step18 is needed for constraint7. So the plan must include steps17-18.

But then, after step18, we are in room4. To satisfy the goal, we need to be in front of blue_door_1 and it's unlocked. After step16, we were in front of blue_door_1 in room3, which is unlocked. So step16 achieves the goal, but we need to also ensure constraint7 is met, which requires green_box_1 to be in room4. So after step18, constraint7 is met.

But the goal is already met at step16, but the plan continues to steps17-18. However, the problem states that the final goal must be achieved, but other constraints must be met at some state, not necessarily the final state. So if green_box_1 is dropped in room4 in step18, then constraint7 is met in that state, even if later steps move it again. But in this case, after step18, it's in room4. So that's okay.

But also, constraint6 requires grey_ball_1 to be in room1. In this plan, we haven't moved grey_ball_1. So we need to address that.

Thus, we need to include steps to move grey_ball_1 to room1. Let's adjust the plan:

After step9 (in room1):

10. gotodoor purple_door_1 room1 room2

11. toggle purple_door_1 (already unlocked)

12. gotoroom room1 room2 purple_door_1

13. gotodoor purple_door_2 room2 room4

14. toggle purple_door_2 (already unlocked)

15. gotoroom room2 room4 purple_door_2

16. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room4

17. pick grey_ball_1 room4

18. gotodoor purple_door_2 room4 room2

19. gotoroom room4 room2 purple_door_2

20. gotodoor purple_door_1 room2 room1

21. gotoroom room2 room1 purple_door_1

22. drop grey_ball_1 room1

Then proceed to step10 (original step10 is now step23):

But this adds many steps and makes the plan longer. This is not optimal.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a more efficient way. For example, when in room4 initially, pick up grey_ball_1 and carry it through to room1.

Let me try:

1. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room4

2. pick grey_ball_1 room4

3. gotodoor purple_door_2 room4 room2

4. toggle purple_door_2

5. gotoroom room4 room2 purple_door_2

6. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room2 (satisfy constraint9)

7. gotodoor purple_door_1 room2 room1

8. toggle purple_door_1

9. gotoroom room2 room1 purple_door_1

10. drop grey_ball_1 room1 (satisfy constraint6)

11. gotodoor green_door_1 room1 room3

12. toggle green_door_1

13. gotoroom room1 room3 green_door_1

14. gotoobject green_box_1 room3

15. pick green_box_1 room3

16. gotodoor blue_door_1 room3 room4

17. toggle blue_door_1 (unlock, goal achieved)

18. gotoroom room3 room4 blue_door_1

19. drop green_box_1 room4 (satisfy constraint7)

Now, this plan has 19 steps. But let's check all constraints:

constraint1: blue_door_1 is locked in initial state. Check.

constraint2: in initial state, blue_door_1 is locked, and in step2, we are holding grey_ball_1. Check.

constraint3: blue_door_1 is unlocked at step17. Check.

constraint4: before unlocking blue_door_1 (step17), we were in room1 at step9-10. Check.

constraint5: in step15, holding green_box_1. Check.

constraint6: grey_ball_1 in room1 after step10. Check.

constraint7: green_box_1 in room4 after step19. Check.

constraint8: when in front of blue_door_1 (step17), earlier state step6 (in front of blue_ball_1). Check.

constraint9: satisfied via step6.

constraint10: grey_box_1 is initially in room1, so even though we moved grey_ball_1 to room1, the constraint10 is grey_box_1 in room3 or green_ball_1 in room1. grey_box_1 is in room1, but the condition is OR. Wait, no: constraint10 is "grey_box_1 is in room3 or green_ball_1 is in room1". Initially, grey_box_1 is in room1. So the OR condition is not met, because grey_box_1 is in room1, not room3. So the condition is not satisfied. Therefore, we need to either move grey_box_1 to room3 or green_ball_1 to room1. In this plan, green_ball_1 is still in room3. So we need to move green_ball_1 to room1 or move grey_box_1 to room3.

Thus, this plan still fails constraint10.

To satisfy constraint10, need to either move green_ball_1 to room1 or grey_box_1 to room3.

In the current plan, we can add steps to move green_ball_1 to room1.

So after step13 (in room3):

14. gotoobject green_ball_1 room3

15. pick green_ball_1 room3

16. gotodoor green_door_1 room3 room1

17. gotoroom room3 room1 green_door_1

18. drop green_ball_1 room1 (now constraint10 satisfied)

19. gotoobject green_box_1 room3

... but wait, after step17, we are in room1. So need to go back to room3 to get green_box_1.

This is getting too long. This seems infeasible for an optimal plan.

Alternative idea: Since grey_box_1 is already in room1, but the constraint requires grey_box_1 in room3 OR green_ball_1 in room1. So if we move grey_box_1 to room3, then the constraint is satisfied.

So steps:

After step9 (in room1):

10. gotoobject grey_box_1 room1

11. pick grey_box_1 room1

12. gotodoor green_door_1 room1 room3

13. toggle green_door_1 (unlock)

14. gotoroom room1 room3 green_door_1

15. drop grey_box_1 room3 (satisfies constraint10)

16. gotoobject green_box_1 room3

17. pick green_box_1 room3

18. gotodoor blue_door_1 room3 room4

19. toggle blue_door_1 (unlock, goal achieved)

20. gotoroom room3 room4 blue_door_1

21. drop green_box_1 room4 (satisfies constraint7)

But this adds steps. Let's count:

1. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room4

2. pick grey_ball_1 room4

3. gotodoor purple_door_2 room4 room2

4. toggle purple_door_2

5. gotoroom room4 room2 purple_door_2

6. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room2

7. gotodoor purple_door_1 room2 room1

8. toggle purple_door_1

9. gotoroom room2 room1 purple_door_1

10. drop grey_ball_1 room1

11. gotoobject grey_box_1 room1

12. pick grey_box_1 room1

13. gotodoor green_door_1 room1 room3

14. toggle green_door_1

15. gotoroom room1 room3 green_door_1

16. drop grey_box_1 room3

17. gotoobject green_box_1 room3

18. pick green_box_1 room3

19. gotodoor blue_door_1 room3 room4

20. toggle blue_door_1

21. gotoroom room3 room4 blue_door_1

22. drop green_box_1 room4

Now, this plan has 22 steps, but it's very long. The optimal plan should be shorter.

But the problem requires the plan to be optimal (shortest possible). Given the numerous constraints, it's challenging to find a shorter plan. Perhaps there's a way to combine some actions.

For example, when moving from room4 to room2, pick up purple_ball_1 and grey_ball_1, but this requires dropping and picking up, which adds steps.

Alternatively, after step10 (drop grey_ball_1 in room1), pick up grey_box_1 there and move it to room3.

But this requires steps.

Another angle: constraint12 requires that at some state, green_ball_1 is in room2 or you are in front of empty. Since green_ball_1 is in room3, moving it to room2 would satisfy this. Or, you can gotoempty somewhere. For example, after any gotoempty action, constraint12 is satisfied. So if the plan includes a gotoempty action, that's sufficient. So maybe insert a gotoempty step somewhere.

For example, after step5 (in room2), do a gotoempty.

This would satisfy constraint12.

So adding:

6. gotoempty room2

But this adds a step but satisfies constraint12.

Similarly, constraint8 requires that when in front of blue_door_1, earlier state was in front of blue_ball_1 or grey_ball_1 in room2. If during the plan, grey_ball_1 is moved to room1, then the only way is to have been in front of blue_ball_1.

But if we can satisfy constraint8 by having been in front of blue_ball_1, then we don't need to move grey_ball_1 to room2.

But in the initial plan, when you are in room2, you can gotoobject blue_ball_1 room2, which satisfies the condition.

So perhaps, the key steps are:

1. From room4, go to room2 via purple_door_2, unlock it.

2. In room2, goto blue_ball_1 (satisfies constraint9).

3. Go to room1 via purple_door_1, unlock.

4. Go to room3 via green_door_1, unlock.

5. In room3, goto blue_door_1, unlock it (goal achieved).

But need to handle other constraints.

But also need to:

- Hold an object to satisfy constraint2 and 11.

- Move grey_ball_1 to room1 (constraint6).

- Move green_box_1 to room4 (constraint7).

- Either move grey_box_1 to room3 or green_ball_1 to room1 (constraint10).

- Ensure at least once in front of empty (constraint12).

- Ensure at least once holding purple_ball_1 or in front of green_door_1 (constraint13).

Let's try to incorporate these.

Plan outline:

1. In room4, pick up grey_ball_1.

2. Move to room2, unlock purple_door_2.

3. In room2, goto blue_ball_1.

4. Move to room1, unlock purple_door_1.

5. Drop grey_ball_1 in room1 (constraint6).

6. Move to room3, unlock green_door_1.

7. In room3, pick up green_box_1.

8. Move to room4 via blue_door_1 (unlock it, which is the goal).

9. Drop green_box_1 in room4 (constraint7).

But this requires steps to unlock blue_door_1.

Detailed steps:

1. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room4

2. pick grey_ball_1 room4 (constraint11, holding object)

3. gotodoor purple_door_2 room4 room2

4. toggle purple_door_2 (unlock)

5. gotoroom room4 room2 purple_door_2

6. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room2 (satisfies constraint9)

7. gotodoor purple_door_1 room2 room1

8. toggle purple_door_1 (unlock)

9. gotoroom room2 room1 purple_door_1

10. drop grey_ball_1 room1 (constraint6)

11. gotodoor green_door_1 room1 room3

12. toggle green_door_1 (unlock)

13. gotoroom room1 room3 green_door_1

14. gotoobject green_box_1 room3

15. pick green_box_1 room3 (holding green_box_1, satisfies constraint5)

16. gotodoor blue_door_1 room3 room4

17. toggle blue_door_1 (unlock; now in front of it in room3, goal achieved)

18. gotoroom room3 room4 blue_door_1

19. drop green_box_1 room4 (constraint7)

20. gotoempty room4 (satisfies constraint12)

Now, check constraints:

constraint1: blue_door_1 was locked initially. Check.

constraint2: initial state blue_door_1 locked, and in steps2-15-17, holding objects. Check.

constraint3: blue_door_1 unlocked at step17. Check.

constraint4: before step17, visited room1 at step9. Check.

constraint5: step15, holding green_box_1. Check.

constraint6: step10, grey_ball_1 in room1. Check.

constraint7: step19, green_box_1 in room4. Check.

constraint8: step17 in front of blue_door_1, earlier step6 in front of blue_ball_1. Check.

constraint9: step6. Check.

constraint10: grey_box_1 is in room1 initially. So the condition is grey_box_1 in room3 OR green_ball_1 in room1. Initially, neither. But after step10, grey_ball_1 is in room1. But constraint10 requires grey_box_1 in room3 OR green_ball_1 in room1. grey_ball_1 is different from green_ball_1. So constraint10 is not satisfied. Oops, mistake here. grey_ball_1 is in room1, but constraint10 requires green_ball_1 in room1 or grey_box_1 in room3. So in this plan, neither is true. Thus, this plan is invalid.

So we need to address constraint10. Either move grey_box_1 to room3 or green_ball_1 to room1.

In this plan, green_ball_1 is still in room3. So we need to move it to room1. So additional steps:

After step13 (in room3):

14. gotoobject green_ball_1 room3

15. pick green_ball_1 room3

16. gotodoor green_door_1 room3 room1

17. gotoroom room3 room1 green_door_1

18. drop green_ball_1 room1 (constraint10 satisfied)

19. gotoobject green_box_1 room3

But wait, after step17, we are in room1. So need to go back to room3.

This adds steps and makes the plan longer. 

Alternatively, move grey_box_1 from room1 to room3. So after step10 (drop grey_ball_1 in room1):

11. gotoobject grey_box_1 room1

12. pick grey_box_1 room1

13. gotodoor green_door_1 room1 room3

14. toggle green_door_1 (unlock)

15. gotoroom room1 room3 green_door_1

16. drop grey_box_1 room3 (constraint10)

17. gotoobject green_box_1 room3

18. pick green_box_1 room3

19. gotodoor blue_door_1 room3 room4

20. toggle blue_door_1 (unlock)

21. gotoroom room3 room4 blue_door_1

22. drop green_box_1 room4

23. gotoempty room4 (constraint12)

This plan has 23 steps, which is long. But considering all constraints, it's challenging to find a shorter plan. However, the problem requires an optimal (shortest) plan. Let's try to find a smarter way.

Alternative approach: Use the purple_ball_1 in room4 to satisfy constraint13 (holding purple_ball_1 or in front of green_door_1). If we hold purple_ball_1 at some point, that satisfies constraint13. So instead of moving grey_ball_1, maybe pick up purple_ball_1 first.

Plan:

1. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room4

2. pick purple_ball_1 room4 (constraint13 and 11)

3. gotodoor purple_door_2 room4 room2

4. toggle purple_door_2

5. gotoroom room4 room2 purple_door_2

6. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room2 (constraint9)

7. gotodoor purple_door_1 room2 room1

8. toggle purple_door_1

9. gotoroom room2 room1 purple_door_1 (constraint4)

10. gotoobject grey_box_1 room1

11. pick grey_box_1 room1

12. gotodoor green_door_1 room1 room3

13. toggle green_door_1

14. gotoroom room1 room3 green_door_1

15. drop grey_box_1 room3 (constraint10)

16. gotoobject green_box_1 room3

17. pick green_box_1 room3

18. gotodoor blue_door_1 room3 room4

19. toggle blue_door_1 (goal achieved)

20. gotoroom room3 room4 blue_door_1

21. drop green_box_1 room4 (constraint7)

22. gotoempty room4 (constraint12)

23. drop purple_ball_1 room4 (if needed)

But in this plan, constraint6 (grey_ball_1 in room1) is not addressed. So need to also move grey_ball_1 to room1. This requires additional steps. This approach isn't solving all constraints.

It's clear that this problem has many interdependent constraints, making it challenging to find an optimal plan. After several attempts, the most feasible plan involves moving grey_ball_1 to room1, green_box_1 to room4, and grey_box_1 to room3, while ensuring all other constraints are met. However, this results in a lengthy plan. Given the complexity, the optimal plan likely requires around 20 steps. However, I might have missed a more efficient path.

After careful consideration, here's a possible optimal plan addressing all constraints:
