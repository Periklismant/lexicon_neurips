Let's understand the problem and find a plan to reach the goal:

Goal: "There is a ball v such that "The following conditions are all true: "v is grey", "you are in front of v"""

This means we need to be in front of a grey ball. From the initial state, there is one grey ball: "grey_ball_1", which is in room_3. We're already in room_3, so we don't need to navigate to a different room.

Let's create a plan:

1. We need to go in front of grey_ball_1 in room_3.
   Action: `gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_3`

That's it. We are already in room_3, and we just need to go in front of the grey ball, which is grey_ball_1.

Let's check if there are any preconditions for this action that aren't satisfied:
- "goto object": you may only go in front of an object x if you are in the same room as x.

We are already in room_3, and grey_ball_1 is in room_3, so this precondition is satisfied.

So, the plan is:
```
gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_3
```

Let's double-check:
- Initial state: We are in room_3.
- After action `gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_3`: We are in front of grey_ball_1, which is a grey ball. This satisfies the goal.

So, the plan is:
```
gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_3
```

This is the most optimal plan as it only requires one action to achieve the goal.
