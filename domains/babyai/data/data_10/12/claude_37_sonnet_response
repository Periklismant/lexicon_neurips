In this planning problem, I need to navigate a gridworld with 4 rooms arranged in a square formation. The rooms are connected by doors, and there are objects (boxes and balls) of different colors in different rooms. I need to plan a sequence of actions to bring about a specific goal while satisfying various constraints.

Let me understand the goal and constraints:

**Goal:**
- I need to be in front of a grey ball.

**Constraints that must be satisfied at some point:**
1. green_door_1 is unlocked AND I am holding grey_ball_1
2. EITHER grey_door_1 is unlocked OR green_door_2 is unlocked
3. I am holding green_ball_2 AND I am in front of green_ball_1
4. I am holding green_ball_1 AND red_door_1 is unlocked
5. I am in room_4
6. green_door_1 is unlocked
7. I am holding some object AND yellow_ball_1 is in room_4
8. I am holding purple_box_1 AND red_door_1 is unlocked
9. grey_box_1 is in room_3
10. green_ball_1 is in room_1

**Initial State:**
- I am in room_3
- Objects in room_1: grey_box_1, yellow_ball_1
- Objects in room_2: green_ball_1, purple_box_1
- Objects in room_3: grey_box_2, yellow_box_1, grey_ball_1, green_ball_2
- All doors are locked
- Connections: room_1<->room_2 via green_door_1, room_1<->room_3 via red_door_1, room_2<->room_4 via green_door_2, room_3<->room_4 via grey_door_1
- I have visited room_3

Let me plan a sequence of actions to achieve the goal while satisfying the constraints. I'll need to think this through step by step and make sure all constraints are satisfied at some point during the plan.

First, I'll note that there are two grey balls: grey_ball_1 (in room_3) and potentially another one (though I don't see it explicitly mentioned in the objects list). So to achieve the goal, I can simply go in front of grey_ball_1 in room_3.

Let me think about the constraints:

1. "green_door_1 is unlocked AND I am holding grey_ball_1" - I need to unlock green_door_1 and pick up grey_ball_1. I can pick it up in room_3, but to unlock green_door_1, I need to get to it first. I would need to use red_door_1 to go to room_1 and then go to the green_door_1.

2. "EITHER grey_door_1 is unlocked OR green_door_2 is unlocked" - I can unlock either door.

3. "I am holding green_ball_2 AND I am in front of green_ball_1" - I need to pick up green_ball_2 (in room_3) and be in front of green_ball_1 (in room_2). I'd need to go to room_2 via room_1.

4. "I am holding green_ball_1 AND red_door_1 is unlocked" - I need to pick up green_ball_1 (in room_2) and unlock red_door_1 (between room_1 and room_3).

5. "I am in room_4" - I need to visit room_4, which I can do via room_2 or room_3.

6. "green_door_1 is unlocked" - I need to unlock green_door_1.

7. "I am holding some object AND yellow_ball_1 is in room_4" - I need to move yellow_ball_1 (from room_1) to room_4 and be holding some object.

8. "I am holding purple_box_1 AND red_door_1 is unlocked" - I need to pick up purple_box_1 (in room_2) and unlock red_door_1.

9. "grey_box_1 is in room_3" - I need to move grey_box_1 (from room_1) to room_3.

10. "green_ball_1 is in room_1" - I need to move green_ball_1 (from room_2) to room_1.

Now, let me try to create a plan that achieves the goal and satisfies all constraints. This will be complex, as I need to transport multiple objects between rooms.

First, I'll plan how to satisfy each constraint while working towards the final goal of being in front of a grey ball:

1. To satisfy constraint 1 (green_door_1 is unlocked AND I am holding grey_ball_1):
   - I need to go to grey_ball_1 in room_3, pick it up
   - Go to red_door_1, toggle it to unlock
   - Go to room_1 via red_door_1
   - Go to green_door_1, toggle it to unlock
   - Now green_door_1 is unlocked AND I am holding grey_ball_1

2. To satisfy constraint 3 (I am holding green_ball_2 AND I am in front of green_ball_1):
   - At some point, I need to drop grey_ball_1
   - Go to green_ball_2 (in room_3) and pick it up
   - Go to room_1 via red_door_1, then to room_2 via green_door_1
   - Go in front of green_ball_1 in room_2
   - Now I'm holding green_ball_2 AND in front of green_ball_1

3. To satisfy constraint 4 (I am holding green_ball_1 AND red_door_1 is unlocked):
   - After being in front of green_ball_1, I need to drop green_ball_2 and pick up green_ball_1
   - Make sure red_door_1 is already unlocked
   - Now I'm holding green_ball_1 AND red_door_1 is unlocked

4. To satisfy constraint 8 (I am holding purple_box_1 AND red_door_1 is unlocked):
   - At some point, I need to drop green_ball_1
   - Go to purple_box_1 in room_2 and pick it up
   - Make sure red_door_1 is already unlocked
   - Now I'm holding purple_box_1 AND red_door_1 is unlocked

5. To satisfy constraint 10 (green_ball_1 is in room_1):
   - After picking up green_ball_1 in room_2
   - I go to room_1 via green_door_1
   - Drop green_ball_1 in room_1
   - Now green_ball_1 is in room_1

6. To satisfy constraint 9 (grey_box_1 is in room_3):
   - I need to go to grey_box_1 in room_1, pick it up
   - Go to room_3 via red_door_1
   - Drop grey_box_1 in room_3
   - Now grey_box_1 is in room_3

7. To satisfy constraint 7 (I am holding some object AND yellow_ball_1 is in room_4):
   - I need to go to yellow_ball_1 in room_1, pick it up
   - Go to room_2 via green_door_1, then to room_4 via green_door_2 (need to unlock green_door_2)
   - Drop yellow_ball_1 in room_4
   - Pick up some other object in room_4
   - Now I'm holding some object AND yellow_ball_1 is in room_4

8. To satisfy constraint 5 (I am in room_4):
   - This is covered when I go to room_4 to drop yellow_ball_1

Let me now try to create a coherent plan, making sure I satisfy all the constraints and reach the final goal. I'll need to unlock doors, pick up and drop objects multiple times.

Here's a draft plan:

1. Start in room_3
2. "gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_3" - Go to grey_ball_1 in room_3
3. "pick grey_ball_1 room_3" - Pick up grey_ball_1
4. "gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1" - Go to red_door_1
5. "toggle red_door_1" - Unlock red_door_1
6. "gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1" - Go to room_1
7. "gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_2" - Go to green_door_1
8. "toggle green_door_1" - Unlock green_door_1 (satisfies constraint 1 and 6)
9. "gotoempty" - Go to an empty position
10. "drop grey_ball_1 room_1" - Drop grey_ball_1 in room_1
11. "gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_1" - Go to yellow_ball_1 in room_1
12. "pick yellow_ball_1 room_1" - Pick up yellow_ball_1
13. "gotoroom room_1 room_2 green_door_1" - Go to room_2
14. "gotodoor green_door_2 room_2 room_4" - Go to green_door_2
15. "toggle green_door_2" - Unlock green_door_2 (satisfies constraint 2)
16. "gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_2" - Go to room_4 (satisfies constraint 5)
17. "gotoempty" - Go to an empty position
18. "drop yellow_ball_1 room_4" - Drop yellow_ball_1 in room_4
19. "gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_2" - Go back to room_2
20. "gotoobject purple_box_1 room_2" - Go to purple_box_1
21. "pick purple_box_1 room_2" - Pick up purple_box_1 (satisfies constraint 8 since red_door_1 is already unlocked)
22. "gotoroom room_2 room_1 green_door_1" - Go to room_1
23. "gotoobject grey_box_1 room_1" - Go to grey_box_1
24. "gotoempty" - Go to an empty position
25. "drop purple_box_1 room_1" - Drop purple_box_1
26. "gotoobject grey_box_1 room_1" - Go to grey_box_1
27. "pick grey_box_1 room_1" - Pick up grey_box_1
28. "gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1" - Go to room_3
29. "gotoempty" - Go to an empty position
30. "drop grey_box_1 room_3" - Drop grey_box_1 (satisfies constraint 9)
31. "gotoobject green_ball_2 room_3" - Go to green_ball_2
32. "pick green_ball_2 room_3" - Pick up green_ball_2
33. "gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1" - Go to room_1
34. "gotoroom room_1 room_2 green_door_1" - Go to room_2
35. "gotoobject green_ball_1 room_2" - Go to green_ball_1 (satisfies constraint 3 since I'm holding green_ball_2)
36. "gotoempty" - Go to an empty position
37. "drop green_ball_2 room_2" - Drop green_ball_2
38. "gotoobject green_ball_1 room_2" - Go to green_ball_1
39. "pick green_ball_1 room_2" - Pick up green_ball_1 (satisfies constraint 4 since red_door_1 is already unlocked)
40. "gotoroom room_2 room_1 green_door_1" - Go to room_1
41. "gotoempty" - Go to an empty position
42. "drop green_ball_1 room_1" - Drop green_ball_1 (satisfies constraint 10)
43. "gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_4" - Wait, I can't go directly to yellow_ball_1 in room_4 from room_1. Let me correct...

I made a mistake. Let me reorganize my plan:

1. Start in room_3
2. "gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_3" - Go to grey_ball_1 in room_3
3. "pick grey_ball_1 room_3" - Pick up grey_ball_1
4. "gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1" - Go to red_door_1
5. "toggle red_door_1" - Unlock red_door_1 (will be used for several constraints)
6. "gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1" - Go to room_1
7. "gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_2" - Go to green_door_1
8. "toggle green_door_1" - Unlock green_door_1 (satisfies constraints 1 and 6 since I'm holding grey_ball_1)
9. "gotoobject grey_box_1 room_1" - Go to grey_box_1
10. "gotoempty" - Go to an empty position
11. "drop grey_ball_1 room_1" - Drop grey_ball_1
12. "gotoobject grey_box_1 room_1" - Go to grey_box_1
13. "pick grey_box_1 room_1" - Pick up grey_box_1
14. "gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1" - Go back to room_3
15. "gotoempty" - Go to an empty position
16. "drop grey_box_1 room_3" - Drop grey_box_1 (satisfies constraint 9)
17. "gotoobject green_ball_2 room_3" - Go to green_ball_2
18. "pick green_ball_2 room_3" - Pick up green_ball_2
19. "gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1" - Go to room_1
20. "gotoroom room_1 room_2 green_door_1" - Go to room_2
21. "gotoobject green_ball_1 room_2" - Go to green_ball_1 (satisfies constraint 3 since I'm holding green_ball_2)
22. "gotoempty" - Go to an empty position
23. "drop green_ball_2 room_2" - Drop green_ball_2
24. "gotoobject green_ball_1 room_2" - Go to green_ball_1
25. "pick green_ball_1 room_2" - Pick up green_ball_1 (satisfies constraint 4 since red_door_1 is unlocked)
26. "gotoobject purple_box_1 room_2" - Wait, I'm already holding green_ball_1, so I can't go to purple_box_1 yet...

I need to be more careful with the constraints and the fact that I can only hold one object at a time.

Let me revise my plan:

1. Start in room_3
2. "gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_3" - Go to grey_ball_1
3. "pick grey_ball_1 room_3" - Pick up grey_ball_1
4. "gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1" - Go to red_door_1
5. "toggle red_door_1" - Unlock red_door_1
6. "gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1" - Go to room_1
7. "gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_2" - Go to green_door_1
8. "toggle green_door_1" - Unlock green_door_1 (satisfies constraints 1 and 6)
9. "gotoempty" - Go to an empty position
10. "drop grey_ball_1 room_1" - Drop grey_ball_1
11. "gotoobject grey_box_1 room_1" - Go to grey_box_1
12. "pick grey_box_1 room_1" - Pick up grey_box_1
13. "gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1" - Go back to room_3
14. "gotoempty" - Go to an empty position
15. "drop grey_box_1 room_3" - Drop grey_box_1 (satisfies constraint 9)
16. "gotoobject green_ball_2 room_3" - Go to green_ball_2
17. "pick green_ball_2 room_3" - Pick up green_ball_2
18. "gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1" - Go to room_1
19. "gotoroom room_1 room_2 green_door_1" - Go to room_2
20. "gotoobject green_ball_1 room_2" - Go to green_ball_1 (satisfies constraint 3)
21. "gotoempty" - Go to an empty position
22. "drop green_ball_2 room_2" - Drop green_ball_2
23. "gotoobject green_ball_1 room_2" - Go to green_ball_1
24. "pick green_ball_1 room_2" - Pick up green_ball_1 (satisfies constraint 4)
25. "gotoroom room_2 room_1 green_door_1" - Go to room_1
26. "gotoempty" - Go to an empty position
27. "drop green_ball_1 room_1" - Drop green_ball_1 (satisfies constraint 10)
28. "gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_1" - Go to yellow_ball_1
29. "pick yellow_ball_1 room_1" - Pick up yellow_ball_1
30. "gotoroom room_1 room_2 green_door_1" - Go to room_2
31. "gotodoor green_door_2 room_2 room_4" - Go to green_door_2
32. "toggle green_door_2" - Unlock green_door_2 (satisfies constraint 2)
33. "gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_2" - Go to room_4 (satisfies constraint 5)
34. "gotoempty" - Go to an empty position
35. "drop yellow_ball_1 room_4" - Drop yellow_ball_1 in room_4 
36. ... (I need to hold something for constraint 7 while yellow_ball_1 is in room_4)

I still need to satisfy constraint 7 (I am holding some object AND yellow_ball_1 is in room_4) and constraint 8 (I am holding purple_box_1 AND red_door_1 is unlocked). 

Let me continue from step 35:

36. "gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_2" - Go back to room_2
37. "gotoobject purple_box_1 room_2" - Go to purple_box_1
38. "pick purple_box_1 room_2" - Pick up purple_box_1 (satisfies constraint 8 since red_door_1 is already unlocked)
39. "gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_2" - Go to room_4 (satisfies constraint 7 since I'm holding purple_box_1 and yellow_ball_1 is in room_4)

Now I need to actually achieve the goal, which is to be in front of a grey ball. I know there's grey_ball_1 which I've moved to room_1.

40. "gotoempty" - Go to an empty position
41. "drop purple_box_1 room_4" - Drop purple_box_1
42. "gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_2" - Go to room_2
43. "gotoroom room_2 room_1 green_door_1" - Go to room_1
44. "gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_1" - Go to grey_ball_1 (achieves the goal of being in front of a grey ball)

However, I realized that I previously moved grey_ball_1 to room_1, and I never picked it up again. So I'll end by being in front of grey_ball_1 in room_1.

Let me review the final plan to make sure it achieves the goal and satisfies all constraints:

1. "gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_3" - Go to grey_ball_1
2. "pick grey_ball_1 room_3" - Pick up grey_ball_1
3. "gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1" - Go to red_door_1
4. "toggle red_door_1" - Unlock red_door_1
5. "gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1" - Go to room_1
6. "gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_2" - Go to green_door_1
7. "toggle green_door_1" - Unlock green_door_1 (satisfies constraints 1 and 6)
8. "gotoempty" - Go to an empty position
9. "drop grey_ball_1 room_1" - Drop grey_ball_1
10. "gotoobject grey_box_1 room_1" - Go to grey_box_1
11. "pick grey_box_1 room_1" - Pick up grey_box_1
12. "gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1" - Go back to room_3
13. "gotoempty" - Go to an empty position
14. "drop grey_box_1 room_3" - Drop grey_box_1 (satisfies constraint 9)
15. "gotoobject green_ball_2 room_3" - Go to green_ball_2
16. "pick green_ball_2 room_3" - Pick up green_ball_2
17. "gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1" - Go to room_1
18. "gotoroom room_1 room_2 green_door_1" - Go to room_2
19. "gotoobject green_ball_1 room_2" - Go to green_ball_1 (satisfies constraint 3)
20. "gotoempty" - Go to an empty position
21. "drop green_ball_2 room_2" - Drop green_ball_2
22. "gotoobject green_ball_1 room_2" - Go to green_ball_1
23. "pick green_ball_1 room_2" - Pick up green_ball_1 (satisfies constraint 4)
24. "gotoroom room_2 room_1 green_door_1" - Go to room_1
25. "gotoempty" - Go to an empty position
26. "drop green_ball_1 room_1" - Drop green_ball_1 (satisfies constraint 10)
27. "gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_1" - Go to yellow_ball_1
28. "pick yellow_ball_1 room_1" - Pick up yellow_ball_1
29. "gotoroom room_1 room_2 green_door_1" - Go to room_2
30. "gotodoor green_door_2 room_2 room_4" - Go to green_door_2
31. "toggle green_door_2" - Unlock green_door_2 (satisfies constraint 2)
32. "gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_2" - Go to room_4 (satisfies constraint 5)
33. "gotoempty" - Go to an empty position
34. "drop yellow_ball_1 room_4" - Drop yellow_ball_1 in room_4
35. "gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_2" - Go back to room_2
36. "gotoobject purple_box_1 room_2" - Go to purple_box_1
37. "pick purple_box_1 room_2" - Pick up purple_box_1 (satisfies constraint 8)
38. "gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_2" - Go to room_4 (satisfies constraint 7)
39. "gotoempty" - Go to an empty position
40. "drop purple_box_1 room_4" - Drop purple_box_1
41. "gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_2" - Go to room_2
42. "gotoroom room_2 room_1 green_door_1" - Go to room_1
43. "gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_1" - Go to grey_ball_1 (achieves the goal)

Final check:
- I need to be in front of a grey ball. Step 43 makes me in front of grey_ball_1, which is grey. Goal achieved.
- Constraint 1: I need green_door_1 unlocked while holding grey_ball_1. This is satisfied in steps 7-8.
- Constraint 2: I need either grey_door_1 or green_door_2 unlocked. This is satisfied in step 31 when I unlock green_door_2.
- Constraint 3: I need to be holding green_ball_2 and in front of green_ball_1. This is satisfied in step 19.
- Constraint 4: I need to be holding green_ball_1 with red_door_1 unlocked. This is satisfied in step 23.
- Constraint 5: I need to be in room_4. This is satisfied in step 32.
- Constraint 6: green_door_1 needs to be unlocked. This is satisfied in step 7.
- Constraint 7: I need to be holding some object while yellow_ball_1 is in room_4. This is satisfied in step 38.
- Constraint 8: I need to be holding purple_box_1 with red_door_1 unlocked. This is satisfied in step 37.
- Constraint 9: grey_box_1 needs to be in room_3. This is satisfied in step 14.
- Constraint 10: green_ball_1 needs to be in room_1. This is satisfied in step 26.

It looks like my plan achieves the goal and satisfies all the constraints. Here's the final plan:

```
gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_3
pick grey_ball_1 room_3
gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1
toggle red_door_1
gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1
gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_2
toggle green_door_1
gotoempty
drop grey_ball_1 room_1
gotoobject grey_box_1 room_1
pick grey_box_1 room_1
gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1
gotoempty
drop grey_box_1 room_3
gotoobject green_ball_2 room_3
pick green_ball_2 room_3
gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_2 green_door_1
gotoobject green_ball_1 room_2
gotoempty
drop green_ball_2 room_2
gotoobject green_ball_1 room_2
pick green_ball_1 room_2
gotoroom room_2 room_1 green_door_1
gotoempty
drop green_ball_1 room_1
gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_1
pick yellow_ball_1 room_1
gotoroom room_1 room_2 green_door_1
gotodoor green_door_2 room_2 room_4
toggle green_door_2
gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_2
gotoempty
drop yellow_ball_1 room_4
gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_2
gotoobject purple_box_1 room_2
pick purple_box_1 room_2
gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_2
gotoempty
drop purple_box_1 room_4
gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_2
gotoroom room_2 room_1 green_door_1
gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_1
```

But actually, I realized we have grey_ball_1 in room_3, and the goal is to be in front of a grey ball. Since I'm starting in room_3 and grey_ball_1 is already there, I could just go in front of it to achieve the goal. 

However, I still need to satisfy all the constraints. Let me double-check if I can simplify the plan.

I need to satisfy constraints like having grey_ball_1 in my hand with green_door_1 unlocked (constraint 1), having green_ball_2 in my hand while in front of green_ball_1 (constraint 3), etc. These constraints require me to manipulate multiple objects and move between rooms.

Given the complexity of the constraints, I think the plan I've provided is reasonable in terms of length and achieves the goal while satisfying all the constraints.

One additional optimization: since I'm trying to be in front of grey_ball_1 at the end, and I've moved it to room_1, I could just leave it in room_3 initially and come back to it at the end. This could simplify the plan a bit.

Let me revise the plan with this optimization:

1. "gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_3" - Go to grey_ball_1
2. "pick grey_ball_1 room_3" - Pick up grey_ball_1
3. "gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1" - Go to red_door_1
4. "toggle red_door_1" - Unlock red_door_1
5. "gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1" - Go to room_1
6. "gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_2" - Go to green_door_1
7. "toggle green_door_1" - Unlock green_door_1 (satisfies constraints 1 and 6)
8. "gotoobject grey_box_1 room_1" - Go to grey_box_1
9. "gotoempty" - Go to an empty position
10. "drop grey_ball_1 room_1" - Drop grey_ball_1
11. "gotoobject grey_box_1 room_1" - Go to grey_box_1
12. "pick grey_box_1 room_1" - Pick up grey_box_1
13. "gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1" - Go back to room_3
14. "gotoempty" - Go to an empty position
15. "drop grey_box_1 room_3" - Drop grey_box_1 (satisfies constraint 9)
16. "gotoobject green_ball_2 room_3" - Go to green_ball_2
17. "pick green_ball_2 room_3" - Pick up green_ball_2
18. "gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1" - Go to room_1
19. "gotoroom room_1 room_2 green_door_1" - Go to room_2
20. "gotoobject green_ball_1 room_2" - Go to green_ball_1 (satisfies constraint 3)
21. "gotoempty" - Go to an empty position
22. "drop green_ball_2 room_2" - Drop green_ball_2
23. "gotoobject green_ball_1 room_2" - Go to green_ball_1

40. "gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1" - Wait, I can't go directly from room_4 to room_3 unless I unlock grey_door_1 first.

Let me correct this:

39. "gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_2" - Go to room_4 (satisfies constraint 7)
40. "gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3" - Go to grey_door_1
41. "toggle grey_door_1" - Unlock grey_door_1
42. "gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1" - Go to room_3
43. "gotoempty" - Go to an empty position
44. "drop purple_box_1 room_3" - Drop purple_box_1
45. "gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_3" - Go to grey_ball_1

But wait, grey_ball_1 isn't in room_3 anymore because I moved it to room_1 in steps 1-10.

Let me re-evaluate. I need to end up in front of a grey ball. We have grey_ball_1, which starts in room_3. I can either leave it in room_3 and come back to it at the end, or I can move it to another room.

Let me revise the plan again:

1. "gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_3" - Go to grey_ball_1 (This achieves the goal immediately, but we haven't satisfied the constraints yet)
2. "pick grey_ball_1 room_3" - Pick up grey_ball_1
3. "gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1" - Go to red_door_1
4. "toggle red_door_1" - Unlock red_door_1
5. "gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1" - Go to room_1
6. "gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_2" - Go to green_door_1
7. "toggle green_door_1" - Unlock green_door_1 (satisfies constraints 1 and 6)
8. "gotoempty" - Go to an empty position
9. "drop grey_ball_1 room_1" - Drop grey_ball_1
10. "gotoobject grey_box_1 room_1" - Go to grey_box_1
11. "pick grey_box_1 room_1" - Pick up grey_box_1
12. "gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1" - Go back to room_3
13. "gotoempty" - Go to an empty position
14. "drop grey_box_1 room_3" - Drop grey_box_1 (satisfies constraint 9)
15. "gotoobject green_ball_2 room_3" - Go to green_ball_2
16. "pick green_ball_2 room_3" - Pick up green_ball_2
17. "gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1" - Go to room_1

24. "gotoroom room_2 room_1 green_door_1" - Go to room_1
25. "gotoempty" - Go to an empty position
26. "drop green_ball_1 room_1" - Drop green_ball_1 (satisfies constraint 10)
27. "gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_1" - Go to yellow_ball_1
28. "pick yellow_ball_1 room_1" - Pick up yellow_ball_1
29. "gotoroom room_1 room_2 green_door_1" - Go to room_2
30. "gotodoor green_door_2 room_2 room_4" - Go to green_door_2
31. "toggle green_door_2" - Unlock green_door_2 (satisfies constraint 2)
32. "gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_2" - Go to room_4 (satisfies constraint 5)
33. "gotoempty" - Go to an empty position
34. "drop yellow_ball_1 room_4" - Drop yellow_ball_1 in room_4
35. "gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_2" - Go back to room_2
36. "gotoobject purple_box_1 room_2" - Go to purple_box_1
37. "pick purple_box_1 room_2" - Pick up purple_box_1 (satisfies constraint 8)
38. "gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_2" - Go to room_4 (satisfies constraint 7)
39. "gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3" - Go to grey_door_1
40. "toggle grey_door_1" - Unlock grey_door_1
41. "gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1" - Go to room_3
42. "gotoempty" - Go to an empty position
43. "drop purple_box_1 room_3" - Drop purple_box_1
44. "gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_1" - Wait, I can't go directly to grey_ball_1 in room_1 from room_3 without going through room_1 first.

Let me correct this:

43. "drop purple_box_1 room_3" - Drop purple_box_1
44. "gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1" - Go to room_1
45. "gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_1" - Go to grey_ball_1 (achieves the goal)

I think this plan satisfies all the constraints and achieves the goal. Let me check once more:

The goal is to be in front of a grey ball, and in step 45 I go in front of grey_ball_1, which is grey. Goal achieved.

All constraints are satisfied at some point in the plan.

Here's the final plan:

```
gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_3
pick grey_ball_1 room_3
gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1
toggle red_door_1
gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1
gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_2
toggle green_door_1
gotoempty
drop grey_ball_1 room_1
gotoobject grey_box_1 room_1
pick grey_box_1 room_1
gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1
gotoempty
drop grey_box_1 room_3
gotoobject green_ball_2 room_3
pick green_ball_2 room_3
gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_2 green_door_1
gotoobject green_ball_1 room_2
gotoempty
drop green_ball_2 room_2
gotoobject green_ball_1 room_2
pick green_ball_1 room_2
gotoroom room_2 room_1 green_door_1
gotoempty
drop green_ball_1 room_1
gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_1
pick yellow_ball_1 room_1
gotoroom room_1 room_2 green_door_1
gotodoor green_door_2 room_2 room_4
toggle green_door_2
gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_2
gotoempty
drop yellow_ball_1 room_4
gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_2
gotoobject purple_box_1 room_2
pick purple_box_1 room_2
gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_2
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3
toggle grey_door_1
gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1
gotoempty
drop purple_box_1 room_3
gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_3
```

Actually, I now realize in my plan I placed grey_ball_1 in room_1, but then at the end I'm trying to go to it in room_3. Let me verify the current location of grey_ball_1 and trace through my plan:

- grey_ball_1 starts in room_3
- In step 2, I pick it up
- In step 9, I drop it in room_1
- I never move it again

So grey_ball_1 should be in room_1 at the end, not room_3. I need to fix the last part of my plan:

43. "drop purple_box_1 room_3" - Drop purple_box_1
44. "gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1" - Go to room_1
45. "gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_1" - Go to grey_ball_1 (achieves the goal)

So the corrected final plan is:

```
gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_3
pick grey_ball_1 room_3
gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1
toggle red_door_1
gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1
gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_2
toggle green_door_1
gotoempty
drop grey_ball_1 room_1
gotoobject grey_box_1 room_1
pick grey_box_1 room_1
gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1
gotoempty
drop grey_box_1 room_3
gotoobject green_ball_2 room_3
pick green_ball_2 room_3
gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_2 green_door_1
gotoobject green_ball_1 room_2
gotoempty
drop green_ball_2 room_2
gotoobject green_ball_1 room_2
pick green_ball_1 room_2
gotoroom room_2 room_1 green_door_1
gotoempty
drop green_ball_1 room_1
gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_1
pick yellow_ball_1 room_1
gotoroom room_1 room_2 green_door_1
gotodoor green_door_2 room_2 room_4
toggle green_door_2
gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_2
gotoempty
drop yellow_ball_1 room_4
gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_2
gotoobject purple_box_1 room_2
pick purple_box_1 room_2
gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_2
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3
toggle grey_door_1
gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1
gotoempty
drop purple_box_1 room_3
gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1
gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_1
```

This plan satisfies all the constraints and achieves the goal.

I notice that the goal states: "There is a ball v such that "The following conditions are all true: "v is grey", "you are in front of v"""

This means I need to be in front of a grey ball, and there is one in the initial state: grey_ball_1 is in room_3. If I just go to it directly, I'd achieve the goal in one step. But I still need to satisfy all the constraints.

Wait, I realized that I can also satisfy the goal by being in front of grey_ball_1, which by the end will still be in room_3. Let me double-check.

Actually, in my plan, I moved grey_ball_1 from room_3 to room_1 and never moved it back. So, at the end of my plan, grey_ball_1 should be in room_1, and I correctly go to it in room_1 to achieve the goal.

So, the revised plan is correct:

```
gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_3
pick grey_ball_1 room_3
gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1
toggle red_door_1
gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1
gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_2
toggle green_door_1
gotoempty
drop grey_ball_1 room_1
gotoobject grey_box_1 room_1
pick grey_box_1 room_1
gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1
gotoempty
drop grey_box_1 room_3
gotoobject green_ball_2 room_3
pick green_ball_2 room_3
gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_2 green_door_1
gotoobject green_ball_1 room_2
gotoempty
drop green_ball_2 room_2
gotoobject green_ball_1 room_2
pick green_ball_1 room_2
gotoroom room_2 room_1 green_door_1
gotoempty
drop green_ball_1 room_1
gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_1
pick yellow_ball_1 room_1
gotoroom room_1 room_2 green_door_1
gotodoor green_door_2 room_2 room_4
toggle green_door_2
gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_2
gotoempty
drop yellow_ball_1 room_4
gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_2
gotoobject purple_box_1 room_2
pick purple_box_1 room_2
gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_2
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3
toggle grey_door_1
gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1
gotoempty
drop purple_box_1 room_3
gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1
gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_1
```

This plan satisfies all the constraints and achieves the goal.

(Actually, I just realized there was another constraint: "In the final state, one should be in front of a ball that is grey". However, that's already achieved by the plan so no changes needed.)
