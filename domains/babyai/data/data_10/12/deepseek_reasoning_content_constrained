Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. The goal is to have a grey ball in front of the agent. The initial state has the agent in room_3. Let's look at the grey balls. The grey_ball_1 is in room_3 initially, so maybe that's the target. The final goal is to be in front of a grey ball, which is grey_ball_1. So we need to end up in front of grey_ball_1 in its room. Wait, but maybe the ball could be moved? Let's check the constraints.

The constraints are quite a list. Let me go through them one by one:

1. At some state, green_door_1 is unlocked and the agent is holding grey_ball_1.
2. At least one of grey_door_1 or green_door_2 must be unlocked in some state.
3. At some state, the agent is holding green_ball_2 and is in front of green_ball_1. But green_ball_1 is initially in room_2. So the agent must go to room_2, be in front of green_ball_1, and hold green_ball_2. Wait, but green_ball_2 is in room_3 initially. So maybe the agent needs to carry green_ball_2 to room_2 and then be in front of green_ball_1 while holding it. That seems tricky.
4. Hold green_ball_1 and have red_door_1 unlocked. green_ball_1 is in room_2, so to get it, the agent must go to room_2. But red_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3. So maybe the agent uses another door? Let's see. The doors: room_1 connected to room_2 via green_door_1, and to room_3 via red_door_1. Room_2 connected to room_4 via green_door_2. Room_3 connected to room_4 via grey_door_1. All doors are locked initially. So to move between rooms, the agent must unlock doors. But unlocking requires being in front of the door. To get to a door, the agent must be in the room where the door is, and the position in front of the door isn't blocked. But objects might block doors. For example, if a box is in front of a door in a room, then you can't go to the door. So first, check if any doors are blocked. Let's look at the initial positions of objects.

Initial objects:

room_1 has grey_box_1 (grey) and yellow_ball_1 (yellow).
room_2 has green_ball_1 (green) and purple_box_1 (purple).
room_3 has grey_box_2 (grey), yellow_box_1 (yellow), grey_ball_1 (grey), green_ball_2 (green).
room_4 is empty initially? The problem doesn't mention any objects in room_4.

So in room_3, there are several objects. The agent starts here. To unlock doors, they need to toggle them, which requires being in front of them. But all doors are locked. So the first step is to unlock some doors.

Wait, the agent is in room_3. The doors connected to room_3 are red_door_1 (to room_1) and grey_door_1 (to room_4). Both are locked. So to go to those rooms, the agent needs to unlock the doors. But to unlock them, they need to be in front of them. But to get in front of them, they need to be in the same room. So in room_3, the agent can go to the grey_door_1 (connecting to room_4) or red_door_1 (connecting to room_1). But are there any objects blocking those doors?

The initial positions: in room_3, there's grey_box_2, yellow_box_1, grey_ball_1, green_ball_2. If any of these are in front of the doors, the agent can't go to the door. The problem states that the preconditions for "goto door" require that there's no object blocking the position in front of the door in the current room. So we need to check if the doors in room_3 (red_door_1 and grey_door_1) are blocked.

Assuming that the objects are placed in positions that might block doors, but the problem doesn't specify their exact positions. Wait, the problem says that objects are in rooms, but not their exact locations. So maybe the doors are unblocked unless an object is explicitly in front. Since the problem doesn't mention any door being blocked, perhaps the doors are accessible. So the agent can go to the doors in their current room.

So, in room_3, the agent can go to red_door_1 (connects to room_1) or grey_door_1 (connects to room_4). Both are locked. So first, the agent can go to one of the doors, toggle it to unlock, then go through.

But the constraints require several things. Let's list the constraints again:

1. At least once: green_door_1 unlocked and holding grey_ball_1.
2. At least once: either grey_door_1 or green_door_2 unlocked.
3. At least once: holding green_ball_2 and in front of green_ball_1 (which is in room_2).
4. At least once: holding green_ball_1 and red_door_1 unlocked.
5. At least once: in room_4.
6. At least once: green_door_1 unlocked.
7. At least once: holding some object and yellow_ball_1 in room_4.
8. At least once: holding purple_box_1 and red_door_1 unlocked.
9. At least once: grey_box_1 is in room_3.
10. At least once: green_ball_1 is in room_1.

So, all these constraints need to be satisfied in the plan. Let's start by trying to map out a path that satisfies all these.

First, the agent is in room_3. Let's see which doors can be accessed. Let's say the agent first unlocks grey_door_1 to get to room_4. But constraint 5 requires being in room_4, so that's needed. Also, constraint 2 requires either grey_door_1 or green_door_2 unlocked. So unlocking grey_door_1 would satisfy that. But let's think step by step.

Initial steps:

1. The agent is in room_3. To unlock grey_door_1, need to be in front of it. So first, goto door grey_door_1 in room_3 (since it's connecting room_3 and room_4). So:

Action: gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4

But to do that, the agent must be in room_3. They are. And the door's position in room_3 is unblocked. So this is possible.

Then toggle the door to unlock it.

Action: toggle grey_door_1

Now, grey_door_1 is unlocked. Then, gotoroom room_3 room_4 grey_door_1. Now, the agent is in room_4. That satisfies constraint 5.

But in room_4, there's nothing. But maybe the agent needs to come back. Also, constraint 7 requires that at some point, the agent is holding an object and yellow_ball_1 is in room_4. So yellow_ball_1 starts in room_1. So the agent must move it to room_4. How?

To move yellow_ball_1 to room_4, the agent needs to pick it up from room_1 and drop it in room_4. But how to get to room_1? The agent is in room_3. The doors from room_3 to room_1 is red_door_1, which is locked. So to get to room_1, the agent must unlock red_door_1. But to do that, need to go to red_door_1 in room_3, toggle it. Let's consider that.

But first, let's see the steps taken so far:

1. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4
2. toggle grey_door_1
3. gotoroom room_3 room_4 grey_door_1

Now, agent is in room_4. Now, room_4 is connected to room_2 via green_door_2 and to room_3 via grey_door_1. But green_door_2 is locked. So to get to room_2, the agent would need to go through room_4's door to room_2, which is green_door_2, but that's locked. So maybe the agent needs to unlock that door. But green_door_2 is in room_2 and room_4. So to unlock it, the agent would have to be in front of it in either room_2 or room_4. If the agent is in room_4, they can go to green_door_2 in room_4 (if possible), then toggle it. But the agent is in room_4 now. So:

4. gotodoor green_door_2 room_4 room_2 (if allowed)
But in room_4, is green_door_2 connecting room_4 to room_2. So yes. The agent is in room_4. So the action would be gotodoor green_door_2 room_4 room_2. Then toggle it. Then, unlock green_door_2, which would satisfy constraint 2 (since either grey_door_1 or green_door_2 is unlocked. We've unlocked both now, but at some point, one of them must be. But maybe the plan can include toggling them again, but perhaps it's easier to unlock grey_door_1 and green_door_2 as needed.

But let's think about the constraints. Let's track each constraint as we go.

But perhaps a better approach is to see which constraints are interdependent and require specific sequences. For example, constraint 7 requires holding an object while yellow_ball_1 is in room_4. So the agent must carry yellow_ball_1 to room_4 and drop it there, but during that time, they were holding it. So perhaps after dropping, the state would have the ball in room_4, but the agent isn't holding it anymore. So the constraint must be met while holding any object (could be another one) and yellow_ball_1 is in room_4. So maybe after moving it, the agent picks up another object and then that satisfies the constraint.

Alternatively, the agent could pick up another object while yellow_ball_1 is in room_4. But moving yellow_ball_1 requires bringing it from room_1 to room_4. So the agent must go to room_1, pick up yellow_ball_1, carry it to room_4, and drop it. Let's see how that could happen.

To get to room_1 from room_3, the agent needs to go through red_door_1. But it's locked. So steps to unlock red_door_1:

In room_3:

gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1

toggle red_door_1 (unlocking it)

Then gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1.

Once in room_1, the agent can pick up yellow_ball_1.

But in room_1, there's also grey_box_1. The agent needs to pick up yellow_ball_1. So:

gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_1

pick yellow_ball_1 room_1

Then, to take it to room_4, the agent needs to go back to room_3, then to room_4 via grey_door_1 (already unlocked). So:

gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1 (since red_door_1 is now unlocked)

Then, goto grey_door_1 in room_3, go to room_4.

Then drop yellow_ball_1 in room_4.

But then, the agent must hold some object while yellow_ball_1 is in room_4. So after dropping, the ball is there, but the agent isn't holding anything. So maybe after dropping, the agent picks up another object (like grey_ball_1 in room_3) but that would require moving back. Alternatively, perhaps the agent could carry yellow_ball_1 to room_4, drop it (now it's in room_4), then pick up another object (like green_ball_2 in room_3) while yellow_ball_1 is in room_4. That would satisfy constraint 7.

But let's think step by step. Let's outline a possible plan:

1. Unlock grey_door_1 (room_3 to room_4)
2. Go to room_4 (satisfies constraint 5)
3. Unlock green_door_2 (room_4 to room_2) to satisfy constraint 2 (since green_door_2 is now unlocked)
4. Go back to room_3, unlock red_door_1 to go to room_1.
5. Go to room_1, pick up yellow_ball_1.
6. Take yellow_ball_1 to room_4 via room_3.
7. Drop yellow_ball_1 in room_4. Now yellow_ball_1 is in room_4.
8. Then, go back to room_3, pick up green_ball_2. Now, while holding green_ball_2, the agent is in room_3. But the constraint 7 requires holding some object and yellow_ball_1 is in room_4. So after step 7, when the agent picks up any object (like green_ball_2), that would satisfy the constraint.

But also, constraint 3 requires holding green_ball_2 and being in front of green_ball_1 (which is in room_2). So after picking up green_ball_2, the agent needs to go to room_2, be in front of green_ball_1.

But to get to room_2 from room_3, possible paths: room_3 -> room_1 (if red_door_1 is unlocked) then room_1 -> room_2 via green_door_1 (which is locked initially). So need to unlock green_door_1.

So steps after step 4 (unlock red_door_1):

5. Go to room_1 via red_door_1.

6. In room_1, goto yellow_ball_1, pick it up.

7. Return to room_3 via red_door_1.

8. Go to room_4 via grey_door_1.

9. Drop yellow_ball_1 in room_4.

10. Now, to satisfy constraint 7: the agent needs to hold some object while yellow_ball_1 is in room_4. So after dropping, the agent is empty. So maybe they pick up another object. For example, in room_4, but there are no objects. So the agent needs to go back to room_3 and pick up green_ball_2.

11. Go back to room_3, pick green_ball_2. Now, the agent is holding green_ball_2, and yellow_ball_1 is in room_4. So constraint 7 is satisfied here.

But also, constraint 3 requires holding green_ball_2 and being in front of green_ball_1 (in room_2). So the agent needs to go to room_2. To get to room_2 from room_3, perhaps through room_1 (if green_door_1 is unlocked). So need to unlock green_door_1.

So let's insert steps to unlock green_door_1. To do that, the agent needs to go to room_1 or room_2. Let's say from room_1, green_door_1 connects to room_2. So the agent can go to room_1, then goto green_door_1 in room_1, toggle it to unlock. Then, go to room_2.

But unlocking green_door_1 would also satisfy constraint 6 (green_door_1 unlocked) and constraint 1 (if at that time the agent is holding grey_ball_1). Wait, constraint 1 requires that in some state, green_door_1 is unlocked and agent is holding grey_ball_1. So maybe after unlocking green_door_1, the agent needs to pick up grey_ball_1 (which is in room_1, but wait, grey_ball_1 is in room_3 initially. Wait, initial state: grey_ball_1 is in room_3. Oh, so to hold grey_ball_1, the agent must be in room_3. So maybe after unlocking green_door_1, the agent returns to room_3, picks up grey_ball_1, which would satisfy constraint 1.

But let's track:

- After step 6 (pick yellow_ball_1 in room_1), the agent is holding it. Then, they return to room_3 (step 7), then go to room_4 (step 8), drop it (step9). Then back to room_3 (step10), pick green_ball_2 (step11). Now, to go to room_2, the agent needs to unlock green_door_1. But green_door_1 is in room_1 and room_2. So the agent could go from room_1 to room_2 via green_door_1. So:

From room_3, the agent can go to room_1 via red_door_1 (already unlocked). Then, in room_1, go to green_door_1 (which is locked). So:

12. Go to room_1 via red_door_1.

13. gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_2.

14. toggle green_door_1 (unlocking it). Now, green_door_1 is unlocked (satisfies constraint 6).

Now, the agent can go to room_2 via green_door_1.

But constraint 1 requires that in some state, green_door_1 is unlocked and agent is holding grey_ball_1. So after unlocking green_door_1 (step14), the agent is in room_1, not holding grey_ball_1 (they are holding green_ball_2 from step11). Wait, wait, in step11, after dropping yellow_ball_1 in room_4, the agent returns to room_3, picks up green_ball_2. Then, to unlock green_door_1, they go to room_1 via red_door_1 (step12). Then, unlock green_door_1 (step14). At this point, the agent is holding green_ball_2. So this doesn't satisfy constraint 1. So we need to have a step where the agent is holding grey_ball_1 and green_door_1 is unlocked. So maybe after unlocking green_door_1, the agent needs to go back to room_3, drop green_ball_2, pick up grey_ball_1, and then perhaps return to room_1 where green_door_1 is unlocked. But this could complicate the plan.

Alternatively, maybe after unlocking green_door_1, the agent goes to room_2, picks up green_ball_1 (which is in room_2), then holds it, which would help with constraint 4 (holding green_ball_1 and red_door_1 is unlocked). Because red_door_1 was unlocked earlier.

But let's think again. To satisfy constraint 1, the agent must at some point have green_door_1 unlocked and hold grey_ball_1. So grey_ball_1 is in room_3 initially. So the agent can pick it up in room_3. So maybe after unlocking green_door_1, the agent needs to return to room_3, pick up grey_ball_1, then go to room_1 again. But that's a lot of steps.

Alternatively, during the plan, after unlocking green_door_1, the agent goes to room_3, picks up grey_ball_1, then maybe moves through room_1 to room_2. But this would require the agent to be in room_3 with grey_ball_1, then go to room_1, then room_2.

Let's try to outline this:

After step14 (green_door_1 unlocked), agent is in room_1. Then, they can go to room_2 via green_door_1.

15. gotoroom room_1 room_2 green_door_1.

Now, in room_2. Here, there's green_ball_1 and purple_box_1. The agent is holding green_ball_2 (from step11). So to satisfy constraint3: holding green_ball_2 and being in front of green_ball_1. So they need to be in front of green_ball_1 in room_2 while holding green_ball_2. So:

16. gotoobject green_ball_1 room_2.

At this point, they are in front of green_ball_1, holding green_ball_2. So constraint3 is satisfied here.

Then, maybe drop green_ball_2 here (but why?), but not sure yet. Alternatively, they could pick up green_ball_1. But constraint4 requires holding green_ball_1 and red_door_1 unlocked. So if they pick up green_ball_1, then they can satisfy that.

So:

17. drop green_ball_2 room_2. But then the agent is empty. Then pick up green_ball_1.

But maybe better to first drop green_ball_2, then pick up green_ball_1. But the agent can't pick up green_ball_1 if they are holding something. So:

17. drop green_ball_2 room_2.

18. pick green_ball_1 room_2.

Now, holding green_ball_1. And red_door_1 is unlocked (from step4). So this satisfies constraint4 (holding green_ball_1 and red_door_1 is unlocked).

Then, the agent can proceed to move back to room_1 via green_door_1, then to room_3 via red_door_1, then to room_4 via grey_door_1. But why? To get to room_4 again? Or to fulfill other constraints.

But constraint9 requires grey_box_1 to be in room_3. Initially, grey_box_1 is in room_1. So the agent must move it to room_3. So how?

To move grey_box_1 from room_1 to room_3, the agent needs to pick it up, carry it through red_door_1 (which is unlocked), and drop it in room_3. So steps:

19. go to room_1 from room_2 via green_door_1.

20. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_1.

21. pick grey_box_1 room_1.

22. go to room_3 via red_door_1.

23. drop grey_box_1 room_3. Now, grey_box_1 is in room_3 (satisfies constraint9).

Then, the agent is in room_3, empty-handed. Now, the grey_ball_1 is still in room_3 (initially there). So to satisfy the final goal, the agent needs to be in front of grey_ball_1. But they are in room_3. So:

24. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_3.

But the final goal is to be in front of a grey ball. So that's achieved here. But wait, what about the other constraints?

Let's check all constraints:

1. green_door_1 unlocked and holding grey_ball_1: Not yet achieved. Because after step14, green_door_1 is unlocked. But when is the agent holding grey_ball_1? They need to pick it up. Maybe after step23, drop grey_box_1, then pick up grey_ball_1.

But in the current plan, after step23, the agent is in room_3, dropped grey_box_1. So:

24. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_3.

25. pick grey_ball_1 room_3. Now, holding grey_ball_1. At this point, is green_door_1 unlocked? Yes, since step14 unlocked it. So the agent is holding grey_ball_1 and green_door_1 is unlocked. So this satisfies constraint1.

Then, the agent needs to drop it to be able to do other actions. But the final goal is to be in front of grey_ball_1, which is now in the agent's hands. So they need to drop it.

But wait, the final goal is to have a grey ball in front of the agent. So if the agent is holding it, they are not in front of it. So they need to drop it. So after step25, they need to drop it.

26. drop grey_ball_1 room_3. Now, they are in front of it. So that's the final goal.

But then, the final action is to drop it, which would put them in front of it. So that's the goal.

But let's track all constraints again:

Constraint1: Achieved at step25 (holding grey_ball_1 and green_door_1 is unlocked).

Constraint2: At least one of grey_door_1 or green_door_2 unlocked. grey_door_1 was unlocked at step2, so yes.

Constraint3: Holding green_ball_2 and in front of green_ball_1. This was achieved in step16 and step17, but in step16, the agent was holding green_ball_2 and in front of green_ball_1. But wait, in step16, the agent was holding green_ball_2 (from step11) and in front of green_ball_1 (step16). So yes, constraint3 is satisfied here.

Constraint4: Holding green_ball_1 and red_door_1 unlocked. This was achieved in step18 (picked green_ball_1) while red_door_1 was unlocked in step4.

Constraint5: In room_4: achieved at step3.

Constraint6: green_door_1 unlocked: achieved at step14.

Constraint7: Holding some object and yellow_ball_1 is in room_4. After step9, yellow_ball_1 is in room_4. The agent then picks up green_ball_2 in step11. So during step11, they are holding green_ball_2, and yellow_ball_1 is in room_4. So yes.

Constraint8: Holding purple_box_1 and red_door_1 unlocked. purple_box_1 is in room_2. When is this achieved? The agent hasn't picked up purple_box_1 yet. So this is missing. So we need to add steps to handle this.

Constraint8: Need to hold purple_box_1 and red_door_1 is unlocked. So the agent must go to room_2, pick up purple_box_1 while red_door_1 is unlocked.

So let's see. After step18, the agent is holding green_ball_1. They need to drop that, pick up purple_box_1.

So after step18:

19. drop green_ball_1 room_2.

20. gotoobject purple_box_1 room_2.

21. pick purple_box_1 room_2.

Now, the agent is holding purple_box_1. red_door_1 is unlocked (from step4). So this satisfies constraint8.

Then, the agent can proceed to move purple_box_1 to wherever, but perhaps they need to drop it later.

But this adds steps. Let's adjust the plan accordingly.

Revisiting steps after step18:

18. pick green_ball_1 room_2. (constraint4 satisfied here)

19. drop green_ball_1 room_2. (to pick up purple_box_1)

20. gotoobject purple_box_1 room_2.

21. pick purple_box_1 room_2. (now holding purple_box_1, red_door_1 is unlocked: constraint8 satisfied here)

22. Now, proceed to move purple_box_1 to room_3 or wherever. But maybe just drop it back.

22. drop purple_box_1 room_2.

23. Then, go back to room_1, etc. But this complicates the plan. However, the constraint is only that at some state the agent is holding purple_box_1 and red_door_1 is unlocked. So step21 satisfies that.

So inserting steps19-21:

After step18 (picking green_ball_1):

19. drop green_ball_1 room_2.

20. gotoobject purple_box_1 room_2.

21. pick purple_box_1 room_2. (now constraint8 is satisfied)

22. drop purple_box_1 room_2. (to free hands)

Then proceed to go back to room_1, then to room_3, etc.

But this adds steps. So now, the plan is getting longer. But we need to ensure all constraints are met.

Another constraint is constraint10: green_ball_1 must be in room_1 at some point. Currently, green_ball_1 is in room_2. So the agent needs to move it to room_1. How?

After step19, green_ball_1 is dropped in room_2. So perhaps the agent can pick it up again and carry it to room_1.

But let's think. After step21, the agent drops purple_box_1 in room_2 (step22). Then, they can pick up green_ball_1 again:

23. gotoobject green_ball_1 room_2.

24. pick green_ball_1 room_2.

Then, go to room_1 via green_door_1 (unlocked).

25. gotoroom room_2 room_1 green_door_1.

26. drop green_ball_1 room_1. Now, green_ball_1 is in room_1. So constraint10 is satisfied here.

Then, the agent can proceed to room_3 via red_door_1, then to room_4, etc.

But this adds even more steps. But since the problem requires an optimal plan (shortest possible), this approach may not be optimal. Perhaps there's a way to satisfy multiple constraints with fewer steps.

Alternative approach: After unlocking green_door_1 (step14), the agent can go to room_2, pick up green_ball_1, take it to room_1, drop it (satisfying constraint10). Then, when holding green_ball_1, if red_door_1 is unlocked (which it is), then constraint4 is satisfied. Then, the agent can proceed to pick up purple_box_1, etc.

But this requires careful sequencing.

Alternatively, when the agent is in room_2 after unlocking green_door_1, they can pick up green_ball_1, carry it to room_1, drop it (satisfying constraint10). While holding green_ball_1 and red_door_1 is unlocked, that satisfies constraint4. Then, pick up purple_box_1, which satisfies constraint8.

But let's outline this path:

After step14 (unlock green_door_1):

15. gotoroom room_1 room_2 green_door_1 (now in room_2).

16. gotoobject green_ball_1 room_2.

17. pick green_ball_1 room_2. (now holding it, and red_door_1 is unlocked: satisfies constraint4)

18. gotoroom room_2 room_1 green_door_1.

19. drop green_ball_1 room_1. (satisfies constraint10)

20. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_1.

21. pick grey_box_1 room_1.

22. gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1.

23. drop grey_box_1 room_3. (satisfies constraint9)

Now, the agent is in room_3. Then, pick up grey_ball_1.

24. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_3.

25. pick grey_ball_1 room_3. (now holding it; green_door_1 is unlocked, so constraint1 satisfied)

26. drop grey_ball_1 room_3. (now in front of it, achieving the final goal)

But also need to handle constraint8: holding purple_box_1 and red_door_1 unlocked. So the agent needs to go back to room_2, pick up purple_box_1.

So after step23:

24. gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1.

25. gotoroom room_1 room_2 green_door_1.

26. gotoobject purple_box_1 room_2.

27. pick purple_box_1 room_2. (now holding it, red_door_1 is unlocked: satisfies constraint8)

28. drop purple_box_1 room_2.

Then return to room_3 to pick up grey_ball_1.

But this adds steps. This is getting complicated. Maybe there's a better way.

Another angle: The final goal is to be in front of a grey ball, which is grey_ball_1 in room_3. So the agent just needs to gotoobject grey_ball_1 in room_3. But the constraints require various other steps. However, the initial state already has grey_ball_1 in room_3. So why not just gotoobject grey_ball_1 and be done? Because the constraints must be met during the plan.

Wait, the initial state has the agent in room_3, and grey_ball_1 is in room_3. So if the agent can just gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_3, that's the final goal. But in the initial state, the doors are locked. However, the agent is already in room_3, and grey_ball_1 is there. But the preconditions for "gotoobject" require that the agent is in the same room as the object, which they are. So the agent can perform:

1. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_3.

But then, the constraints are not met. All the constraints must be satisfied in at least one state along the plan. So this single-action plan doesn't meet any constraints except possibly constraint9 (grey_box_1 is in room_3 initially, so that's already true). But the initial state may not count as part of the plan's states. Or does the initial state count as a state? The problem says "a valid plan must abide by the following constraints", which must hold in at least one state of the plan. So the initial state is part of the plan's states. Let's check:

Original state:

- grey_box_1 is in room_1. So constraint9 (grey_box_1 in room_3) is not satisfied initially.

So the initial state doesn't satisfy constraint9. So the plan must include a step where grey_box_1 is in room_3.

But the initial state of the world is given, and the plan must start from there. So the agent must perform actions to satisfy all constraints.

Therefore, the minimal plan would need to include all the steps required to meet all constraints, even if the final goal could be achieved in one step.

Thus, the agent cannot just gotoobject grey_ball_1, because that doesn't meet the other constraints.

This means the agent must perform actions to meet all the constraints, even if the final goal is simple.

So the plan must include:

- Unlocking green_door_1 and holding grey_ball_1 (constraint1)
- Unlocking either grey_door_1 or green_door_2 (constraint2)
- Holding green_ball_2 and being in front of green_ball_1 (constraint3)
- Holding green_ball_1 and red_door_1 unlocked (constraint4)
- Being in room_4 (constraint5)
- Unlocking green_door_1 (constraint6)
- Holding some object and yellow_ball_1 in room_4 (constraint7)
- Holding purple_box_1 and red_door_1 unlocked (constraint8)
- Moving grey_box_1 to room_3 (constraint9)
- Moving green_ball_1 to room_1 (constraint10)

This is a lot to handle. Let's try to find a sequence that hits all these.

Here's a possible plan outline:

1. Unlock grey_door_1 in room_3 to access room_4.
2. Go to room_4 (satisfy constraint5).
3. Return to room_3.
4. Unlock red_door_1 in room_3 to access room_1.
5. Go to room_1, pick yellow_ball_1.
6. Go back to room_3, then to room_4, drop yellow_ball_1 there (satisfy constraint7 when holding it en route).
7. Go back to room_3, pick green_ball_2.
8. Go to room_1 via red_door_1.
9. Unlock green_door_1 in room_1.
10. Go to room_2 via green_door_1.
11. In room_2, pick green_ball_1 (satisfy constraint4 when holding it and red_door_1 is unlocked).
12. Drop green_ball_1 in room_1 (satisfy constraint10).
13. Pick grey_box_1 in room_1 and drop it in room_3 (satisfy constraint9).
14. Go back to room_2, pick purple_box_1 (satisfy constraint8).
15. Return to room_3.
16. Pick grey_ball_1 (satisfy constraint1 when green_door_1 is unlocked).
17. Drop grey_ball_1 and goto it (final goal).

But this is a rough outline. Let's see:

Step-by-step:

1. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4
2. toggle grey_door_1 (unlock) → constraint2 satisfied (grey_door_1 unlocked)
3. gotoroom room_3 room_4 grey_door_1 → constraint5 satisfied
4. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1
5. gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1
6. toggle red_door_1 (unlock)
7. gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1
8. gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_1
9. pick yellow_ball_1 room_1 → constraint7 (holding yellow_ball_1, later when it's in room_4)
10. gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1
11. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4
12. gotoroom room_3 room_4 grey_door_1
13. drop yellow_ball_1 room_4 → now yellow_ball_1 is in room_4. When did we hold an object while it's there? During steps9-13, the agent was holding it until step13. So constraint7 is satisfied during steps9-13.
14. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1
15. gotoobject green_ball_2 room_3
16. pick green_ball_2 room_3 → now holding it
17. gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1
18. gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1
19. gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_2
20. toggle green_door_1 → unlocks it (constraint6 and constraint1 needs green_door_1 unlocked)
21. gotoroom room_1 room_2 green_door_1
22. gotoobject green_ball_1 room_2
23. pick green_ball_1 room_2 → holding it, red_door_1 is unlocked → constraint4 satisfied
24. gotoroom room_2 room_1 green_door_1
25. drop green_ball_1 room_1 → constraint10 satisfied
26. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_1
27. pick grey_box_1 room_1
28. gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1
29. drop grey_box_1 room_3 → constraint9 satisfied
30. gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1
31. gotoroom room_1 room_2 green_door_1
32. gotoobject purple_box_1 room_2
33. pick purple_box_1 room_2 → holding it, red_door_1 is unlocked → constraint8 satisfied
34. drop purple_box_1 room_2
35. gotoroom room_2 room_1 green_door_1
36. gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1
37. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_3
38. pick grey_ball_1 room_3 → now holding it and green_door_1 is unlocked → constraint1 satisfied
39. drop grey_ball_1 room_3 → now in front of it (final goal)

This plan satisfies all constraints:

- constraint1: step38
- constraint2: step2 (grey_door_1 unlocked)
- constraint3: step22 (in front of green_ball_1) while holding green_ball_2 (step16-22). Wait, no. Between steps16 and 22, the agent is holding green_ball_2. But when they reach room_2 (step21), they are holding green_ball_2. Then step22 is gotoobject green_ball_1, which requires being in room_2. So after step22, the agent is in front of green_ball_1, holding green_ball_2. So constraint3 is satisfied here.

- constraint4: step23
- constraint5: step3
- constraint6: step20
- constraint7: steps9-13, holding yellow_ball_1 while moving it to room_4.
- constraint8: step33
- constraint9: step29
- constraint10: step25

This plan is quite long, but it covers all constraints. However, there might be a shorter path.

Alternative approach: Maybe combine steps. For example, after dropping yellow_ball_1 in room_4 (step13), instead of returning to room_3, maybe go to room_2 via room_4's green_door_2 (if unlocked). But green_door_2 is locked initially, so need to unlock it. That could help in reaching room_2 without going through room_1 and green_door_1.

But this adds steps for unlocking green_door_2. For example:

After step13 (yellow_ball_1 in room_4):

14. gotodoor green_door_2 room_4 room_2.

15. toggle green_door_2 (unlocks it → satisfies constraint2 as green_door_2 is now unlocked)

16. gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_2.

Then, in room_2, pick up green_ball_1, etc. This might save steps.

But this requires the agent to unlock green_door_2, which is in room_4. This could be done after step3 (being in room_4). Then, the agent can unlock green_door_2 there, which would satisfy constraint2.

Let's adjust the plan:

1. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4
2. toggle grey_door_1 → unlocks it (constraint2)
3. gotoroom room_3 room_4 grey_door_1 → constraint5
4. gotodoor green_door_2 room_4 room_2
5. toggle green_door_2 → unlocks it (constraint2)
6. gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_2
7. gotoobject green_ball_1 room_2
8. pick green_ball_1 room_2 → constraint4 not met yet, since red_door_1 is still locked.
But red_door_1 is in room_3 and room_1. So the agent needs to unlock it.

This approach may not be better. It depends on how steps are ordered.

Alternatively, the agent can unlock multiple doors early on to facilitate movement.

But considering time constraints, perhaps the initial outline is the way to go. However, the plan needs to be optimal (shortest possible). The initial plan I thought of has 39 steps, which is definitely not optimal. There must be a way to satisfy all constraints with fewer actions.

Let's think of a more optimal path:

To achieve the final goal (in front of grey_ball_1 in room_3), the agent needs to be there. So the plan must end with:

gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_3

But during the plan, the agent must meet all constraints.

Now, let's see how to hit each constraint with minimal steps:

Constraint1: green_door_1 unlocked and holding grey_ball_1.

To do this, after unlocking green_door_1, the agent picks up grey_ball_1. But grey_ball_1 is in room_3. So the agent must unlock green_door_1 (which is in room_1 and room_2), then go back to room_3, pick up grey_ball_1.

Constraint2: unlock either grey_door_1 or green_door_2. Unlocking grey_door_1 is easier since it's in room_3.

Constraint3: hold green_ball_2 and in front of green_ball_1 (room_2). So the agent must carry green_ball_2 from room_3 to room_2, then be in front of green_ball_1.

Constraint4: hold green_ball_1 and red_door_1 unlocked. So after unlocking red_door_1, pick up green_ball_1 in room_2.

Constraint5: be in room_4. So unlock grey_door_1 and go there.

Constraint6: unlock green_door_1.

Constraint7: hold any object and yellow_ball_1 in room_4. So move yellow_ball_1 to room_4 and while holding something.

Constraint8: hold purple_box_1 and red_door_1 unlocked. So after unlocking red_door_1, pick up purple_box_1 in room_2.

Constraint9: move grey_box_1 to room_3.

Constraint10: move green_ball_1 to room_1.

Let's try to combine actions:

Possible steps:

1. Unlock grey_door_1 (room_3): goto door, toggle. Then go to room_4 (constraint5).

2. Return to room_3, unlock red_door_1 (to access room_1).

3. Go to room_1, pick yellow_ball_1, carry it to room_4 via room_3 and grey_door_1. Drop it in room_4 (satisfy constraint7).

4. Go back to room_3, pick green_ball_2.

5. Go to room_1, unlock green_door_1 (constraint6).

6. Go to room_2 via green_door_1.

7. In room_2, pick green_ball_1 (constraint4 when red_door_1 is unlocked).

8. Take green_ball_1 to room_1 and drop (constraint10).

9. Pick grey_box_1 in room_1, take to room_3 (constraint9).

10. In room_2, pick purple_box_1 (constraint8).

11. Back to room_3, pick grey_ball_1 (constraint1).

12. Drop grey_ball_1 and goto it.

Now, let's detail this:

1. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4
2. toggle grey_door_1 → unlocks (constraint2)
3. gotoroom room_3 room_4 grey_door_1 → constraint5
4. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1
5. gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1
6. toggle red_door_1 → unlocks
7. gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1
8. gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_1
9. pick yellow_ball_1 room_1 → now holding it
10. gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1
11. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4
12. gotoroom room_3 room_4 grey_door_1
13. drop yellow_ball_1 room_4 → now in room_4, constraint7 satisfied when held during steps9-13
14. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1
15. gotoobject green_ball_2 room_3
16. pick green_ball_2 room_3 → now holding it
17. gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1
18. gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_2
19. toggle green_door_1 → unlocks (constraint6)
20. gotoroom room_1 room_2 green_door_1
21. gotoobject green_ball_1 room_2
22. pick green_ball_1 room_2 → constraint4 (red_door_1 is unlocked)
23. gotoroom room_2 room_1 green_door_1
24. drop green_ball_1 room_1 → constraint10
25. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_1
26. pick grey_box_1 room_1
27. gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1
28. drop grey_box_1 room_3 → constraint9
29. gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1
30. gotoroom room_1 room_2 green_door_1
31. gotoobject purple_box_1 room_2
32. pick purple_box_1 room_2 → constraint8 (red_door_1 is unlocked)
33. gotoroom room_2 room_1 green_door_1
34. gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1
35. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_3
36. pick grey_ball_1 room_3 → constraint1 (green_door_1 is unlocked)
37. drop grey_ball_1 room_3 → now in front of it (final goal)

This plan has 37 steps. Still quite long, but perhaps it's the minimal required. However, I must check if there's a way to reuse steps for multiple constraints.

For example, when moving yellow_ball_1 to room_4 (steps8-13), the agent is holding it, which satisfies constraint7 (holding some object and yellow_ball_1 is in room_4 after step13). But during step9-13, the agent is holding it while moving to room_4, so constraint7 is satisfied when yellow_ball_1 is in room_4 and the agent is holding it. However, after dropping it, the agent is no longer holding it. So constraint7 requires that in at least one state, the agent is holding some object and yellow_ball_1 is in room_4. That state occurs when the agent is holding yellow_ball_1 in room_4 (during step13 before dropping). So yes.

Similarly, other constraints can be met during these steps.

But perhaps there's a way to combine steps. For example, after unlocking green_door_1, the agent can go to room_2, pick up green_ball_1 and purple_box_1 in one trip.

But each action is separate. The agent can only pick one object at a time.

Another possible optimization: After picking green_ball_2 in room_3 (step16), the agent can carry it to room_2 and drop it there, then pick up green_ball_1. This would satisfy constraint3 (holding green_ball_2 and in front of green_ball_1) during the process.

For example:

After step16 (holding green_ball_2), agent goes to room_2 via room_1 and green_door_1.

17. gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1
18. gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_2
19. toggle green_door_1 (unlock)
20. gotoroom room_1 room_2 green_door_1
21. gotoobject green_ball_1 room_2 (now in front of it, holding green_ball_2 → constraint3 satisfied)
22. drop green_ball_2 room_2
23. pick green_ball_1 room_2 (constraint4)
24. take it to room_1 and drop (constraint10)

This way, constraint3 is satisfied during step21.

This reduces the steps by combining the carrying of green_ball_2 to room_2 and being in front of green_ball_1.

Incorporating this:

Let's revise the plan:

1. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4
2. toggle grey_door_1 → constraint2
3. gotoroom room_3 room_4 grey_door_1 → constraint5
4. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1
5. gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1
6. toggle red_door_1 → unlocks
7. gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1
8. gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_1
9. pick yellow_ball_1 room_1
10. gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1
11. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4
12. gotoroom room_3 room_4 grey_door_1
13. drop yellow_ball_1 room_4 → constraint7 satisfied during steps9-13
14. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1
15. gotoobject green_ball_2 room_3
16. pick green_ball_2 room_3
17. gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1
18. gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_2
19. toggle green_door_1 → constraint6
20. gotoroom room_1 room_2 green_door_1
21. gotoobject green_ball_1 room_2 → holding green_ball_2 (constraint3)
22. drop green_ball_2 room_2
23. pick green_ball_1 room_2 → constraint4
24. gotoroom room_2 room_1 green_door_1
25. drop green_ball_1 room_1 → constraint10
26. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_1
27. pick grey_box_1 room_1
28. gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1
29. drop grey_box_1 room_3 → constraint9
30. gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1
31. gotoroom room_1 room_2 green_door_1
32. gotoobject purple_box_1 room_2
33. pick purple_box_1 room_2 → constraint8
34. gotoroom room_2 room_1 green_door_1
35. gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1
36. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_3
37. pick grey_ball_1 room_3 → constraint1 (green_door_1 unlocked)
38. drop grey_ball_1 room_3 → final goal

Now, this plan has 38 steps. Still long, but perhaps this is the minimal way given the constraints. However, I suspect there's a more optimal approach. Maybe some steps can be eliminated by combining movements.

Another angle: The agent can satisfy multiple constraints in a single step. For example, when the agent is holding green_ball_2 in room_2 and in front of green_ball_1, this satisfies constraint3. If during the same trip, the agent can also pick up purple_box_1, that could help. But they can't carry two objects at once.

Alternatively, when moving grey_box_1 to room_3, maybe the agent can carry another object as well. But again, only one object at a time.

Given the complexity, it's challenging to find a shorter plan. However, perhaps some steps can be optimized. For example, after dropping yellow_ball_1 in room_4 (step13), the agent can directly go to room_2 via green_door_2 if it's unlocked. But green_door_2 is locked initially. So the agent needs to unlock it. Let's see:

After step13 (yellow_ball_1 in room_4), the agent is in room_4. They can unlock green_door_2 there:

14. gotodoor green_door_2 room_4 room_2
15. toggle green_door_2 → unlocks (constraint2)
16. gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_2
17. gotoobject green_ball_1 room_2
18. pick green_ball_1 room_2 → but red_door_1 is locked? No, step6 unlocked it.

Wait, red_door_1 is unlocked at step6. So holding green_ball_1 and red_door_1 is unlocked satisfies constraint4. Then, the agent can take green_ball_1 to room_1 via room_4 → room_2 → room_1? Not sure. This may shorten the plan.

But this approach may require fewer steps. Let's try:

1. Unlock grey_door_1 (steps1-2)
2. Go to room_4 (step3)
3. Unlock green_door_2 in room_4 (steps14-15)
4. Go to room_2 via green_door_2 (step16)
5. Pick green_ball_1 (step18)
6. Go to room_1 via green_door_1 (but it's locked). So need to unlock green_door_1 from room_2.

But this approach complicates things. It's hard to say if this would save steps.

Overall, it's clear that the problem requires a lengthy plan to satisfy all constraints. Given the time constraints, I'll proceed to outline the plan based on the earlier steps, ensuring all constraints are met.
