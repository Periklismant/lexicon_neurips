Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. The goal is to have a blue box in front of the agent. The initial state has the agent in room_1 with some boxes. There are multiple constraints that need to be satisfied at some point during the plan. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the final goal is straightforward: the agent needs to be in front of a blue box. The available blue boxes in the initial state are blue_box_1, blue_box_2 in room_1, blue_box_3 in room_3, and blue_ball_1 in room_4. But since the goal specifies a box, the balls are irrelevant here. So the possible targets are blue_box_1, blue_box_2, blue_box_3. The agent is in room_1 initially, so maybe one of those in room_1 is easier? But wait, maybe moving to another room is needed because of the constraints.

Now, the constraints are a bunch of conditions that must be true at some point in the plan. Let's list them:

1. At some state: grey_box_1 in room_3 OR agent in front of purple_box_1.
2. At some state: holding blue_ball_1 AND yellow_door_2 is unlocked.
3. At some state: in front of yellow_door_1.
4. At some state: in room_4 AND holding some object.
5. At some state: in front of purple_box_1 OR red_door_1 unlocked.
6. At some state: in front of yellow_ball_1 AND holding something.
7. At some state: blue_ball_1 in room_2.
8. At some state: blue_ball_1 in room_3 OR holding blue_box_1.
9. At some state: holding yellow_ball_1 AND in front of green_ball_1.
10. At some state: yellow_door_1 unlocked.

So, the plan must include actions that make each of these true at some point. Let's see how to integrate these.

Starting with constraint 10: yellow_door_1 must be unlocked at some point. Since all doors start locked, the agent needs to toggle it. To toggle a door, the agent must be in front of it. So the agent needs to go to yellow_door_1, which connects room_1 and room_2. The agent is in room_1 initially, so they can go to yellow_door_1 and toggle it. That would satisfy constraint 10 and also help in moving between rooms.

Constraint 3: agent must be in front of yellow_door_1. That's part of the steps needed for toggling it. So when the agent goes to yellow_door_1 and toggles it, that's covered.

Now, constraint 2: holding blue_ball_1 (which is in room_4) AND yellow_door_2 unlocked. So the agent needs to get to room_4, pick up blue_ball_1, and have yellow_door_2 unlocked. But yellow_door_2 connects room_1 and room_3. To unlock it, the agent must be in front of it. So maybe the agent needs to unlock both yellow doors? Wait, but let's see. To get to room_4, the agent can go through room_2 or room_3. Let's see the doors: from room_2 to room_4 via red_door_1 (locked initially), and from room_3 to room_4 via green_door_1 (locked). So to get to room_4, the agent would need to unlock either red_door_1 or green_door_1. But how? Let's think.

Alternatively, maybe the agent can unlock yellow_door_1 first, go to room_2, then unlock red_door_1 (but it's red; do we have any objects of red color? The red_door_1 is red. The boxes and balls don't have red colors. So maybe the agent can't interact with red_door_1 unless they have a key, but there are no keys here. Wait, but the toggle action can be done if the agent is in front of the door. So to unlock red_door_1, the agent must be in front of it, which requires being in room_2 or room_4. Since the agent starts in room_1, they can go to room_2 via yellow_door_1 once it's unlocked. Then, from room_2, go to red_door_1 (which connects to room_4). But red_door_1 is locked, so the agent can go to red_door_1 (if not blocked by an object), toggle it. But wait, in room_2, the objects are purple_box_1 and green_ball_1. Are any of these blocking the door? The problem states that the preconditions for gotodoor include that there's no object blocking the position in front of the door. So the agent needs to check if any object is blocking the door.

In room_2, the objects are purple_box_1 and green_ball_1. If either is in front of the door, the agent can't go to the door. But in the initial state, are these objects blocking doors? The problem's initial state doesn't mention objects blocking doors. The "blocking" condition is only mentioned in the effects of pick: if x was blocking some door, then it's no longer blocked. So perhaps, by default, objects are not blocking doors unless they are placed in front of them. Wait, but in the initial state, the positions of objects aren't specified. So maybe the doors are not blocked unless an object is placed in front. Since the problem doesn't state that any door is blocked, we can assume that the agent can go to any door as long as they are in the right room. So, in room_2, the agent can go to red_door_1, then toggle it to unlock. Then go to room_4.

But let's get back to constraint 2: holding blue_ball_1 and yellow_door_2 unlocked. To hold blue_ball_1, the agent must be in room_4. So the agent needs to get to room_4. Let's think of a path.

Possible path steps:

1. In room_1, go to yellow_door_1 (room_1 to room_2). Toggle it to unlock. This satisfies constraint 10 (yellow_door_1 unlocked) and constraint 3 (in front of yellow_door_1).

2. Then, goto room_2 via yellow_door_1. Now in room_2.

In room_2, the agent can go to red_door_1 (connects to room_4). But red_door_1 is locked. So need to unlock it. So:

3. gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_4. Then toggle red_door_1 to unlock.

Now red_door_1 is unlocked.

4. Then, gotoroom room_2 room_4 red_door_1. Now in room_4.

In room_4, the agent can pick up blue_ball_1 (but blue_ball_1 is a ball, not a box). But constraint 2 requires holding blue_ball_1 while yellow_door_2 is unlocked. So the agent needs to unlock yellow_door_2. How? Yellow_door_2 connects room_1 and room_3. To unlock it, the agent must be in front of it. So the agent would need to go back to room_1 or room_3. But the agent is in room_4. Let's see: from room_4, there's red_door_1 (to room_2) and green_door_1 (to room_3). Both doors are initially locked. The agent has unlocked red_door_1, so can go back to room_2. To unlock green_door_1, need to go to room_3 or room_4. But green_door_1 connects room_3 and room_4. So the agent is in room_4, can go to green_door_1, but need to unlock it. But to unlock it, the agent must be in front of it. So, in room_4, gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3, then toggle it. But green_door_1 is locked. So the agent can toggle it if they are in front. So steps:

After reaching room_4:

5. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3.

6. toggle green_door_1 (unlock it).

Now, green_door_1 is unlocked.

7. gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1. Now in room_3.

In room_3, there's yellow_ball_1 and blue_box_3. The agent can pick up yellow_ball_1. But there's a constraint (9) that requires holding yellow_ball_1 and being in front of green_ball_1. Green_ball_1 is in room_2. So the agent needs to carry yellow_ball_1 to room_2 and be in front of green_ball_1. That's a bit complex. Alternatively, maybe the agent can go back to room_1 via yellow_door_2, which is locked. To unlock yellow_door_2, the agent must go to it. So from room_3, gotodoor yellow_door_2 (since yellow_door_2 connects room_1 and room_3). If in room_3, can go to yellow_door_2, toggle it to unlock. Then go to room_1. Then go to room_2 again via yellow_door_1 (already unlocked). Then go to room_2, then to room_4 via red_door_1 (unlocked). Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let's see.

But constraint 2 requires that at some point, the agent is holding blue_ball_1 (which is in room_4) and yellow_door_2 is unlocked. So maybe after the agent unlocks yellow_door_2 (which is in room_3 or room_1), and then goes to room_4 to pick up blue_ball_1. Let's try to outline steps that cover all constraints.

Another approach: Let's list all constraints and see which ones can be combined.

Constraint 7: blue_ball_1 is in room_2. Initially, blue_ball_1 is in room_4. So the agent needs to move it. To do that, they must pick it up in room_4 and drop it in room_2. But to do that, the agent needs to get to room_4, pick up blue_ball_1, then go back to room_2 and drop it.

But moving from room_4 to room_2 requires passing through red_door_1 (already unlocked if the agent unlocked it earlier). But also, moving from room_4 to room_2 via red_door_1.

But constraint 7 requires blue_ball_1 in room_2 at some point. So if the agent drops it there, that's covered.

Constraint 8: blue_ball_1 in room_3 or holding blue_box_1. If the agent moves blue_ball_1 to room_2, then it's not in room_3, so unless they hold blue_box_1. So maybe the agent picks up blue_box_1 in room_1 at some point. Blue_box_1 is in room_1. So if the agent, at some point, is holding blue_box_1, that satisfies constraint 8.

Constraint 9: holding yellow_ball_1 and in front of green_ball_1. Yellow_ball_1 is in room_3. Green_ball_1 is in room_2. So the agent needs to pick up yellow_ball_1 in room_3, go to room_2, and be in front of green_ball_1. Then drop or something. But how to move between rooms? Maybe after unlocking the necessary doors.

Constraint 5: in front of purple_box_1 (in room_2) or red_door_1 unlocked. If the agent unlocks red_door_1 (which is needed to get to room_4), then that satisfies the second part. So constraint 5 is already covered if red_door_1 is unlocked.

Constraint 1: grey_box_1 in room_3 (it's initially in room_4) or in front of purple_box_1. To move grey_box_1 to room_3, the agent needs to pick it up in room_4 and drop it in room_3. But moving grey_box_1 would require carrying it. Alternatively, being in front of purple_box_1 (in room_2) would satisfy it. So perhaps the agent can go to purple_box_1 in room_2, which would satisfy constraint 1. That's easier.

Constraint 4: in room_4 and holding some object. So when the agent is in room_4 and holding, say, blue_ball_1, that's covered.

Constraint 6: in front of yellow_ball_1 (room_3) and holding something. So the agent needs to go to yellow_ball_1 in room_3 while holding an object. For example, pick up yellow_ball_1, but that would require dropping it again? Wait, if the agent picks up yellow_ball_1, then they are holding it. But then, the action of picking it up would require being in front of it. So when they pick it up, they are in front of it and holding it. So that action would satisfy constraint 6. But maybe they need to hold something else while being in front of yellow_ball_1. Hmm, maybe not. Let me check. If the agent is holding an object (any object) and is in front of yellow_ball_1, that satisfies constraint 6. So when the agent picks up yellow_ball_1, during the pick action, they are in front of it and then holding it. So the state after picking up would include having held it, but the action of picking it up would have required being in front of it. Wait, the "pick" action's effect is that you are no longer in front of x. So during the pick action, the agent is in front of x, then after picking, they are no longer in front. So the state during the action (when the action is executed) would have the agent in front of yellow_ball_1 and then holding it. But the effect is applied after the action. So the state where the agent is in front of yellow_ball_1 and holding something (the ball) would be during the action execution. Wait, but the constraints require that the condition holds in at least one state. So the state after the action is performed would have the agent not in front of the ball anymore. So the condition must be true at some state during the plan. So the pick action would cause the agent to be in front of the ball and then holding it. So during the action's execution, before the effects are applied, the agent is in front of the ball and not holding it. Then, after the action, they are holding it and not in front. So maybe the pick action itself doesn't satisfy the condition. Therefore, to satisfy constraint 6, the agent needs to be in front of yellow_ball_1 while holding some object. So perhaps they need to carry another object to room_3, be in front of yellow_ball_1 while holding it. For example, pick up blue_box_3 in room_3, then goto yellow_ball_1. But the gotoobject action requires being in the same room. If the agent is in room_3 and holding blue_box_3, then they can go to yellow_ball_1. But when they go to yellow_ball_1, they are in front of it while holding blue_box_3. That would satisfy constraint 6. Then, they can pick up yellow_ball_1 (but need to drop blue_box_3 first). Alternatively, maybe the agent can hold yellow_ball_1 and then go to another object, but that might not be necessary. This seems a bit complicated. Let's think of a possible path that covers all constraints.

Let me try to outline a plan step by step, considering all constraints.

Initial state: agent in room_1, not holding anything. Doors locked.

1. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1. (Possible since agent is in room_1 and the box is there.)

Wait, but after this action, the agent is in front of blue_box_1. But the goal requires being in front of a blue box. So if the agent just does this action, the goal is achieved. But we need to check all constraints. However, the constraints must be met during the plan. So even if the plan is as short as possible, all constraints must be satisfied at some point.

But this plan (just going to blue_box_1) would not satisfy any constraints except maybe some. Let's see.

Constraints:

10. yellow_door_1 unlocked: No, it's still locked.

So this plan is invalid. So the agent must perform actions that satisfy all constraints.

So the agent must unlock yellow_door_1, which requires being in front of it. So steps:

1. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2. (Precondition: agent is in room_1, door connects room_1 and room_2, no object blocking. Since no objects are blocking, this is possible.)

2. toggle yellow_door_1. Now yellow_door_1 is unlocked. This satisfies constraints 3 (in front of yellow_door_1) and 10 (yellow_door_1 unlocked).

3. gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1. Now in room_2.

4. gotoobject purple_box_1 room_2. (This satisfies constraint 1: in front of purple_box_1.)

5. Now, to satisfy constraint 5 (either in front of purple_box_1 or red_door_1 unlocked). Step 4 already covers the first part, so constraint 5 is satisfied.

Now, need to handle other constraints.

Next, constraint 4: in room_4 and holding something. So the agent needs to get to room_4 while holding an object.

But how to get to room_4? From room_2, the door to room_4 is red_door_1, which is locked. So:

6. gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_4. (Assuming no objects blocking.)

7. toggle red_door_1. Now it's unlocked.

8. gotoroom room_2 room_4 red_door_1. Now in room_4.

9. pick blue_ball_1 room_4. Now holding blue_ball_1. This satisfies constraint 4 (in room_4 and holding something).

But constraint 2 requires holding blue_ball_1 and yellow_door_2 unlocked. So the agent needs to have yellow_door_2 unlocked. Currently, yellow_door_2 is locked. How to unlock it?

Yellow_door_2 connects room_1 and room_3. The agent is in room_4. To get there, need to go through room_3 via green_door_1 (locked) or room_2 via red_door_1 (unlocked). Let's proceed:

10. From room_4, go back to room_2 via red_door_1.

11. From room_2, go to room_1 via yellow_door_1 (already unlocked).

12. Now in room_1. Need to unlock yellow_door_2, which connects to room_3.

13. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_1 room_3.

14. toggle yellow_door_2. Now it's unlocked. Now, constraint 2 (holding blue_ball_1 and yellow_door_2 unlocked) is satisfied if the agent is holding blue_ball_1 during this. Wait, but after step 9, the agent is holding blue_ball_1. But in step 10, they would drop it if they need to pick something else? No, they are still holding it. Wait, steps after 9: agent is in room_4 holding blue_ball_1. Then they go to room_2 (step 10: gotoroom room_4 room_2 red_door_1). Then to room_1 (step 11: gotoroom room_2 room_1 yellow_door_1). Then step 13: gotodoor yellow_door_2, step 14: toggle it. So during step 14, the agent is holding blue_ball_1 (assuming they didn't drop it). So this satisfies constraint 2.

So step 14: toggle yellow_door_2 (now unlocked) while holding blue_ball_1. So constraint 2 is met here.

Now, constraint 7: blue_ball_1 in room_2. The agent is holding it, so to satisfy this, they need to drop it in room_2. Let's say after step 14, the agent goes to room_2 again.

15. gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1.

16. gotoempty (to drop blue_ball_1).

17. drop blue_ball_1 room_2. Now blue_ball_1 is in room_2. This satisfies constraint 7.

But now, the agent is no longer holding blue_ball_1. So any constraints that require holding it after this would not be met. But constraint 2 was already satisfied during step 14.

Now, constraint 9: holding yellow_ball_1 and in front of green_ball_1. Yellow_ball_1 is in room_3. The agent needs to go to room_3, pick it up, then go to room_2 and be in front of green_ball_1.

To get to room_3, from room_1, use yellow_door_2 (now unlocked).

18. gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_2. Now in room_3.

19. gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_3.

20. pick yellow_ball_1 room_3. Now holding it.

21. gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_2.

22. gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1.

23. gotoobject green_ball_1 room_2. Now in front of green_ball_1 while holding yellow_ball_1. This satisfies constraint 9.

Now, constraint 6: in front of yellow_ball_1 and holding something. Wait, no. Constraint 6 is: "The following conditions are all true: "you are in front of yellow_ball_1", "you are holding some object"". But the agent picked up yellow_ball_1 in step 20. At that moment, during the pick action, they were in front of it and then became holding it. But after picking, they are no longer in front of it. So that action would not satisfy constraint 6. So the agent needs to be in front of yellow_ball_1 while holding something. For example, if the agent is carrying another object and goes to yellow_ball_1. Let's think.

But in this current path, after step 20, the agent is holding yellow_ball_1 and then moves to room_2. So how to satisfy constraint 6? Maybe the agent needs to be in front of yellow_ball_1 while holding another object. For example, they could pick up blue_box_3 in room_3, then go to yellow_ball_1.

Let's adjust steps:

After step 18 (agent in room_3):

19. gotoobject blue_box_3 room_3.

20. pick blue_box_3 room_3. Now holding it.

21. gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_3. Now in front of yellow_ball_1 while holding blue_box_3. This satisfies constraint 6.

22. drop blue_box_3 room_3 (optional, but maybe not needed).

23. pick yellow_ball_1 room_3.

Then proceed to room_2 as before. So inserting steps 19-21 would cover constraint 6.

Alternatively, maybe there's a more efficient way. But this is getting complex.

Alternatively, after step 20 (holding yellow_ball_1), the agent could go to room_3 and go to yellow_ball_1 again while holding it. But once they pick it up, they are no longer in front of it. So they can't be in front of it again unless they drop it. So maybe the agent needs to drop yellow_ball_1, then go to it again while holding something else. This is getting too complicated.

Alternatively, maybe during the initial visit to room_3, the agent picks up blue_box_3 (blue), then goes to yellow_ball_1 (satisfying constraint 6: in front of yellow_ball_1 and holding blue_box_3). Then drop blue_box_3, pick up yellow_ball_1.

So steps:

After step 18 (in room_3):

19. gotoobject blue_box_3 room_3.

20. pick blue_box_3 room_3.

21. gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_3. Now in front of yellow_ball_1 while holding blue_box_3. This satisfies constraint 6.

22. drop blue_box_3 room_3.

23. pick yellow_ball_1 room_3.

Now proceed to room_2.

This would cover constraint 6.

Now, constraint 8: blue_ball_1 in room_3 or holding blue_box_1. After step 17, blue_ball_1 is in room_2. So the first part isn't true. But the agent can pick up blue_box_1 in room_1 at some point. For example, after dropping blue_ball_1 in room_2, the agent can go back to room_1 and pick up blue_box_1.

Let's say after step 17:

18. gotoroom room_2 room_1 yellow_door_1.

19. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1.

20. pick blue_box_1 room_1. Now holding blue_box_1. This satisfies constraint 8.

Then proceed to other steps. But this adds more steps. However, this would satisfy constraint 8.

Alternatively, if the agent holds blue_box_1 earlier. For example, after step 1 (unlocking yellow_door_1), the agent could pick up blue_box_1. But they need to go to it first.

Let me reorganize the plan to include picking up blue_box_1 earlier.

Alternative approach:

1. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2.

2. toggle yellow_door_1. (unlocks it, satisfies constraints 3 and 10)

3. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1. (now in front of blue_box_1)

4. pick blue_box_1 room_1. (now holding it, which satisfies constraint 8)

5. drop blue_box_1 room_1. (optional, but maybe not needed. Or carry it.)

But the agent needs to go to room_2, so maybe carrying it would help? Not sure. But holding it would satisfy constraint 8.

But then, when the agent needs to pick up other objects, they need to drop it. So maybe better to pick it up later.

But the agent needs to have at least one state where they are holding blue_box_1 to satisfy constraint 8. If during the plan they do that once, it's sufficient.

But let's try to see: after the agent has to go to room_4, pick blue_ball_1, unlock yellow_door_2 while holding it, then drop blue_ball_1 in room_2 (for constraint 7). Then, later, pick up blue_box_1 in room_1 to satisfy constraint 8.

But this adds steps. Let's see:

After step 17 (blue_ball_1 in room_2), agent is in room_2.

18. gotoroom room_2 room_1 yellow_door_1.

19. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1.

20. pick blue_box_1 room_1. Now holding it. This satisfies constraint 8.

21. drop blue_box_1 room_1. (If needed for other steps.)

But this adds steps. However, this may be necessary to meet all constraints.

Now, constraint 1: grey_box_1 in room_3 or in front of purple_box_1. We already did in front of purple_box_1 earlier (step 4 in the initial approach), so that's covered.

Now, the only remaining constraint is constraint 9: holding yellow_ball_1 and in front of green_ball_1. So after picking up yellow_ball_1 in room_3, the agent needs to go to room_2 and be in front of green_ball_1.

So steps after picking up yellow_ball_1:

24. gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_2.

25. gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1.

26. gotoobject green_ball_1 room_2. Now in front of green_ball_1 while holding yellow_ball_1. This satisfies constraint 9.

Finally, the goal is to be in front of a blue box. The agent could go to blue_box_1 in room_1, which is blue.

So after step 26:

27. gotoroom room_2 room_1 yellow_door_1.

28. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1.

This achieves the goal.

Now, compiling all these steps, ensuring that all constraints are met at some point.

But this is getting very lengthy. Let's try to outline a step-by-step plan that covers all constraints, making sure each is met at least once.

Final plan outline:

1. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2
2. toggle yellow_door_1 (unlocks it, meets constraints 3 and 10)
3. gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1
4. gotoobject purple_box_1 room_2 (meets constraint 1)
5. gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_4
6. toggle red_door_1 (unlocks it)
7. gotoroom room_2 room_4 red_door_1
8. pick blue_ball_1 room_4 (now in room_4 holding it, meets constraint 4)
9. gotoroom room_4 room_2 red_door_1
10. gotoroom room_2 room_1 yellow_door_1
11. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_1 room_3
12. toggle yellow_door_2 (unlocks it; now holding blue_ball_1, meets constraint 2)
13. gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_2
14. gotoobject blue_box_3 room_3
15. pick blue_box_3 room_3 (now holding it)
16. gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_3 (in front of it while holding blue_box_3, meets constraint 6)
17. drop blue_box_3 room_3
18. pick yellow_ball_1 room_3 (now holding it)
19. gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_2
20. gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1
21. gotoobject green_ball_1 room_2 (in front of green_ball_1 while holding yellow_ball_1, meets constraint 9)
22. gotoroom room_2 room_1 yellow_door_1
23. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1 (goal achieved)

But also need to handle constraint 7 (blue_ball_1 in room_2). Currently, blue_ball_1 was picked up in step 8 and is still being held until step 12. But after step 12, the agent is holding blue_ball_1 and needs to drop it in room_2.

Wait, after step 8: agent is holding blue_ball_1. Then steps 9-12: moving to room_1, toggling yellow_door_2. Then in step 13, they go to room_3. But blue_ball_1 is still being held. To satisfy constraint 7 (blue_ball_1 in room_2), the agent needs to drop it in room_2. So after step 8, the agent goes to room_2 and drops it there.

Wait, after step 8 (pick blue_ball_1 in room_4), step 9: go to room_2 via red_door_1. Then, step 10: go to room_1. But to drop blue_ball_1 in room_2, after step 9 (in room_2), the agent can:

9.1. gotoempty room_2
9.2. drop blue_ball_1 room_2 (now satisfies constraint 7)
Then proceed to step 10.

So revised steps after step 8:

8. pick blue_ball_1 room_4
9. gotoroom room_4 room_2 red_door_1
10. gotoempty room_2
11. drop blue_ball_1 room_2 (meets constraint 7)
12. gotoroom room_2 room_1 yellow_door_1
13. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_1 room_3
14. toggle yellow_door_2 (unlocks it, but agent is not holding blue_ball_1 anymore. So constraint 2 is not met here. Oops! Constraint 2 requires holding blue_ball_1 AND yellow_door_2 unlocked. But after step 11, blue_ball_1 is dropped in room_2, so agent is not holding it during step 14. So this approach fails to meet constraint 2.

So this is a problem. To satisfy constraint 2, the agent must be holding blue_ball_1 while yellow_door_2 is unlocked. So the unlocking of yellow_door_2 must happen while the agent is holding blue_ball_1. Therefore, steps must be arranged so that the agent holds blue_ball_1 when unlocking yellow_door_2.

So perhaps:

After step 8 (pick blue_ball_1 in room_4), the agent needs to go to room_1 and unlock yellow_door_2 while holding it.

Revised steps after step 8:

8. pick blue_ball_1 room_4 (holding it)
9. gotoroom room_4 room_2 red_door_1
10. gotoroom room_2 room_1 yellow_door_1 (now in room_1 holding blue_ball_1)
11. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_1 room_3
12. toggle yellow_door_2 (unlocks it. Now holding blue_ball_1, so constraint 2 is met)
13. gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_2 (now in room_3)
14. gotoempty room_3
15. drop blue_ball_1 room_3 (now blue_ball_1 is in room_3, which satisfies constraint 8 if needed. Wait, constraint 8 is blue_ball_1 in room_3 OR holding blue_box_1. So if blue_ball_1 is in room_3 at step 15, then that part of constraint 8 is met. But the agent also needs to meet other constraints.

But the agent needs to eventually get blue_ball_1 to room_2 to satisfy constraint 7. So after dropping it in room_3, they need to pick it up again and move it to room_2.

This is getting very involved. Let's try to adjust the plan to ensure all constraints are met.

Alternative plan:

1. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2
2. toggle yellow_door_1 (unlocked, meets constraints 3,10)
3. gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1
4. gotoobject purple_box_1 room_2 (meets constraint 1)
5. gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_4
6. toggle red_door_1 (unlocked)
7. gotoroom room_2 room_4 red_door_1
8. pick blue_ball_1 room_4 (holding it, now in room_4 meets constraint 4)
9. gotoroom room_4 room_2 red_door_1
10. gotoempty room_2
11. drop blue_ball_1 room_2 (meets constraint 7)
12. gotoroom room_2 room_1 yellow_door_1
13. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_1 room_3
14. toggle yellow_door_2 (unlocks it, but not holding blue_ball_1 anymore. So constraint 2 not met)
Problem: step 14 does not satisfy constraint 2. So need to adjust.

Alternative approach: after step 8 (holding blue_ball_1), go directly to unlock yellow_door_2.

8. pick blue_ball_1 room_4
9. gotoroom room_4 room_2 red_door_1
10. gotoroom room_2 room_1 yellow_door_1 (now in room_1 holding blue_ball_1)
11. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_1 room_3
12. toggle yellow_door_2 (unlocks it while holding blue_ball_1; meets constraint 2)
13. gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_2
14. gotoobject blue_box_3 room_3
15. pick blue_box_3 room_3 (now holding it)
16. gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_3 (in front of it while holding blue_box_3; meets constraint 6)
17. drop blue_box_3 room_3
18. pick yellow_ball_1 room_3 (now holding it)
19. gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_2
20. gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1
21. gotoobject green_ball_1 room_2 (in front of it while holding yellow_ball_1; meets constraint 9)
22. gotoroom room_2 room_1 yellow_door_1
23. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1 (goal achieved)

But step 11 requires the agent to be in room_1 and go to yellow_door_2. Also, after step 12, the agent is in room_1, then steps 13: go to room_3.

Now, constraint 7: blue_ball_1 is in room_2. But in this plan, blue_ball_1 was dropped in room_2 at step 11? Wait, no. In this plan, after step 8 (pick blue_ball_1 in room_4), step 9 (go to room_2), step 10 (go to room_1), step 12 (toggle yellow_door_2), and then later steps. The blue_ball_1 is still being held until when? After step 12, the agent is in room_1 holding blue_ball_1. Then steps 13-18 involve going to room_3, picking up blue_box_3, then yellow_ball_1. So blue_ball_1 is still in the agent's hand until they drop it somewhere. But the agent can't carry two objects at once. So after step 8, they are holding blue_ball_1 until they drop it. 

Wait, the agent can't pick up another object while holding blue_ball_1. So steps 15-18 require dropping blue_ball_1 first. So let's adjust:

After step 12 (agent in room_1, holding blue_ball_1, yellow_door_2 unlocked):

13. gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_2
14. gotoempty room_3
15. drop blue_ball_1 room_3 (now it's in room_3, meeting part of constraint 8)
16. gotoobject blue_box_3 room_3
17. pick blue_box_3 room_3 (now holding it)
18. gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_3 (front, holding blue_box_3; meets constraint 6)
19. drop blue_box_3 room_3
20. pick yellow_ball_1 room_3 (now holding it)
21. gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_2
22. gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1
23. gotoobject green_ball_1 room_2 (front, holding yellow_ball_1; meets constraint 9)
24. drop yellow_ball_1 room_2 (optional)
25. gotoempty room_2
26. pick blue_ball_1 room_2 (if needed)
But constraint 7 requires blue_ball_1 to be in room_2. So after step 15, blue_ball_1 is in room_3. To get it to room_2:

Need to pick it up in room_3, carry it to room_2, and drop it.

So after step 15:

16. pick blue_ball_1 room_3 (but agent is not holding anything after step 15)
17. gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_2
18. gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1
19. gotoempty room_2
20. drop blue_ball_1 room_2 (now meets constraint 7)

Then proceed to handle other constraints.

But this adds more steps. This is getting quite involved. However, given the constraints, the agent must navigate through multiple rooms, unlock doors, and manipulate objects to meet all requirements.

Final plan:

1. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2
2. toggle yellow_door_1
3. gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1
4. gotoobject purple_box_1 room_2
5. gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_4
6. toggle red_door_1
7. gotoroom room_2 room_4 red_door_1
8. pick blue_ball_1 room_4
9. gotoroom room_4 room_2 red_door_1
10. gotoroom room_2 room_1 yellow_door_1
11. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_1 room_3
12. toggle yellow_door_2
13. gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_2
14. gotoempty room_3
15. drop blue_ball_1 room_3
16. gotoobject blue_box_3 room_3
17. pick blue_box_3 room_3
18. gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_3
19. drop blue_box_3 room_3
20. pick yellow_ball_1 room_3
21. gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_2
22. gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1
23. gotoobject green_ball_1 room_2
24. gotoroom room_2 room_1 yellow_door_1
25. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1

Now, check which constraints are met:

- Constraint 1: in front of purple_box_1 (step 4)
- Constraint 2: holding blue_ball_1 (step 8-14) and yellow_door_2 unlocked (step 12)
- Constraint 3: in front of yellow_door_1 (step 1)
- Constraint 4: in room_4 holding blue_ball_1 (step 8)
- Constraint 5: red_door_1 unlocked (step 6)
- Constraint 6: in front of yellow_ball_1 while holding blue_box_3 (step 18)
- Constraint 7: blue_ball_1 is in room_3 (step 15) but needs to be in room_2. Not satisfied here. Oops, this is a problem.

So this plan fails to meet constraint 7. Thus, need to adjust.

To meet constraint 7, blue_ball_1 must be in room_2 at some point. So after step 15, blue_ball_1 is in room_3. Need to move it to room_2.

Steps after 15:

16. pick blue_ball_1 room_3
17. gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_2
18. gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1
19. drop blue_ball_1 room_2 (now satisfies constraint 7)
20. gotoobject blue_box_3 room_3 (but agent is now in room_2. Need to go back to room_3)

This complicates the plan. Alternatively, after step 8, the agent should drop blue_ball_1 in room_2 instead of room_3.

Let me try again:

After step 8 (pick blue_ball_1 in room_4):

9. gotoroom room_4 room_2 red_door_1
10. gotoempty room_2
11. drop blue_ball_1 room_2 (meets constraint 7)
12. gotoroom room_2 room_1 yellow_door_1
13. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_1 room_3
14. toggle yellow_door_2 (now unlocked, but agent is not holding blue_ball_1. So constraint 2 not met)

So this plan also fails constraint 2. To fix this, the agent must hold blue_ball_1 while unlocking yellow_door_2. Therefore, they need to carry blue_ball_1 from room_2 back to room_1 and then to room_3.

Alternative steps:

After step 11 (blue_ball_1 in room_2):

12. pick blue_ball_1 room_2 (now holding it)
13. gotoroom room_2 room_1 yellow_door_1
14. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_1 room_3
15. toggle yellow_door_2 (unlocks it while holding blue_ball_1; meets constraint 2)
16. gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_2
17. drop blue_ball_1 room_3 (now meets constraint 8)
18. gotoobject blue_box_3 room_3
19. pick blue_box_3 room_3
20. gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_3 (meets constraint 6)
21. drop blue_box_3 room_3
22. pick yellow_ball_1 room_3
23. gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_2
24. gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1
25. gotoobject green_ball_1 room_2 (meets constraint 9)
26. gotoroom room_2 room_1 yellow_door_1
27. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1 (goal)

This plan meets all constraints:

- Constraint 1: step 4 (front of purple_box_1)
- Constraint 2: step 15 (holding blue_ball_1 and yellow_door_2 unlocked)
- Constraint 3: step 1
- Constraint 4: step 8 (in room_4 holding blue_ball_1)
- Constraint 5: step 6 (red_door_1 unlocked)
- Constraint 6: step 20 (front of yellow_ball_1, holding blue_box_3)
- Constraint 7: step 11 (blue_ball_1 in room_2)
- Constraint 8: step 17 (blue_ball_1 in room_3)
- Constraint 9: step 25 (front of green_ball_1, holding yellow_ball_1)
- Constraint 10: step 2 (yellow_door_1 unlocked)

Yes, this plan meets all constraints. Now, let's write the step-by-step actions.
