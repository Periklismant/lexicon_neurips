Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. The goal is to have a blue box that I'm in front of. The initial state is in room_1, where there are two blue boxes: blue_box_1 and blue_box_2. But all doors are locked, so I can't leave room_1 unless I unlock a door. Wait, but how do I unlock a door? The toggle action requires being in front of the door. But to get in front of a door, I need to go to it, which is in the same room. But room_1 has doors yellow_door_1 (connecting to room_2) and yellow_door_2 (connecting to room_3). But those doors are locked. So first, I need to get in front of one of these doors to toggle them.

But wait, can I go to a door in the same room even if it's locked? The "gotodoor" action's preconditions say: (i) you are in a room which door d is connecting with another room, which is true for yellow_door_1 and yellow_door_2 in room_1. (ii) there's no object blocking the position in front of d in the current room. Are there any objects blocking the doors in room_1? The initial state says blue_box_1 and blue_box_2 are in room_1. Do boxes block doors? The "pick" action's effect (v) says if x was blocking a door, then it's no longer blocking. So maybe if a box is in front of a door, it's blocking. But in the initial state, are any boxes blocking doors?

The problem doesn't mention any objects blocking doors initially. So maybe the doors in room_1 are not blocked. So I can go to yellow_door_1 or yellow_door_2.

So first, I need to go to one of the doors in room_1. Let's pick yellow_door_1 first. So:

Action: gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2.

But wait, the gotodoor action's syntax is "gotodoor d r1 r2" where d is the door, and r1 and r2 are the rooms it connects. So for yellow_door_1, which connects room_1 and room_2, the correct arguments would be "gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2". But since I'm in room_1, that's allowed. After that, I can toggle the door to unlock it. Then, go through the door to room_2. But why would I need to go to another room? Because the goal is to be in front of a blue box. The initial room has blue boxes, so maybe I don't need to go anywhere else. Wait, but the problem's goal is "there exists a box v such that v is blue and you are in front of v". So if I'm already in room_1 with blue boxes, perhaps I can just go to one of them. But the initial state says the agent is in room_1, but not in front of any object. So the initial position is not in front of any object. So I need to perform "gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1". But wait, the precondition for "gotoobject" is that I'm in the same room as the object. Since I'm in room_1, and blue_box_1 is there, that's allowed. So why can't I just do that?

But wait, the doors are all locked. But the "gotoobject" action doesn't require doors to be unlocked. Because you're moving within the same room. So maybe the plan is simply:

gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1.

But then, why is the initial state having all doors locked? Maybe there's a constraint I'm missing. Wait, the problem mentions that there are constraints the plan must abide by. But the user didn't list them here. Wait, looking back at the problem statement: "A valid plan for the abovementioned problem must abide by the following constraints:" but then the user didn't paste the constraints. Wait, looking back at the user's input. Wait, the original problem had constraints, but in the user's message, after the initial state and goal, the constraints are not included. Wait, the user wrote: "A valid plan for the abovementioned problem must abide by the following constraints:" but then there's nothing. Maybe it's a formatting error. But in the provided problem, perhaps the constraints are missing. Wait, the user might have intended to include constraints but forgot. But given that the problem is as presented, maybe there are no constraints beyond the preconditions. So perhaps the answer is straightforward.

Wait, but maybe the initial doors are locked, so if the boxes are in the same room, but the doors are locked, but moving within the room doesn't require doors. So the agent can just go to the blue box in room_1. Let me check the initial state again.

The initial state has the agent in room_1. blue_box_1 and blue_box_2 are in room_1. The doors are locked, but the agent is in room_1. So to go to blue_box_1, the agent can do "gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1". But are there any objects blocking the path? The preconditions for "gotoobject" are that the agent is in the same room as the object. Since the agent is in room_1, and the object is in room_1, that's allowed. So the action is possible.

But then why would the problem have all the doors locked? Because maybe the agent is supposed to not have access to other rooms, but the goal can be achieved in the initial room. So the optimal plan is just one action: gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1.

But wait, the agent is initially not in front of any object. So to get in front of a blue box, which is in the same room, the agent can directly go to it. So the plan would be:

gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1

But let me make sure there are no constraints preventing this. Since the user didn't list any constraints (maybe a formatting error), but according to the given problem, the answer is simply that.

But perhaps there's a hidden constraint. For example, maybe the doors being locked prevent movement, but since the movement is within the same room, the doors' states don't affect it. So yes, the optimal plan is just one action.
