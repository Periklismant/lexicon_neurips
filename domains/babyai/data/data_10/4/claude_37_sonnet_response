Let's understand this problem. We have a 2D gridworld with 4 rooms arranged in a square formation:
- room_1 (north-west)
- room_2 (south-west)
- room_3 (north-east)
- room_4 (south-east)

These rooms are connected by 4 doors:
- yellow_door_1 connects room_1 and room_2
- yellow_door_2 connects room_1 and room_3
- red_door_1 connects room_2 and room_4
- green_door_1 connects room_3 and room_4

All doors are initially locked.

Objects in the rooms:
- room_1: blue_box_1, blue_box_2
- room_2: purple_box_1, green_ball_1
- room_3: yellow_ball_1, blue_box_3
- room_4: blue_ball_1, grey_box_1

Initially we are in room_1, not holding any object, and have only visited room_1.

The goal is to be in front of a blue box. This seems quite simple as there are blue boxes in room_1, where we start.

However, there are 10 constraints that must be satisfied at some point during the plan:

1. Either grey_box_1 is in room_3 OR we are in front of purple_box_1
2. We are holding blue_ball_1 AND yellow_door_2 is unlocked
3. We are in front of yellow_door_1
4. We are in room_4 AND holding some object
5. Either we are in front of purple_box_1 OR red_door_1 is unlocked
6. We are in front of yellow_ball_1 AND holding some object
7. blue_ball_1 is in room_2
8. Either blue_ball_1 is in room_3 OR we are holding blue_box_1
9. We are holding yellow_ball_1 AND in front of green_ball_1
10. yellow_door_1 is unlocked

Let's sketch a plan that satisfies these constraints:

1. We need to unlock yellow_door_1 (constraint 10) and go to purple_box_1 in room_2 (constraints 1, 5).
2. We need to move blue_ball_1 from room_4 to room_2 (constraint 7).
3. We need to hold yellow_ball_1 while in front of green_ball_1 (constraint 9).
4. We need to visit room_4 while holding some object (constraint 4).
5. We need to be in front of yellow_ball_1 while holding some object (constraint 6).
6. We need to hold blue_ball_1 while yellow_door_2 is unlocked (constraint 2).
7. At the end, we need to be in front of a blue box (goal).

Let's think about the order. We need to move between rooms, so we'll need to unlock doors. Initially all doors are locked.

Here's a plan:
1. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1 - to satisfy the goal at the end
2. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2 - to unlock yellow_door_1 (constraint 10 and 3)
3. toggle yellow_door_1 - to unlock yellow_door_1 (constraint 10)
4. gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1 - go to room_2
5. gotoobject purple_box_1 room_2 - go to purple_box_1 (constraints 1 and 5)
6. gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_4 - to unlock red_door_1 (also for constraint 5)
7. toggle red_door_1 - to unlock red_door_1
8. gotoroom room_2 room_4 red_door_1 - go to room_4
9. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_4 - to pick up blue_ball_1 for constraint 2
10. pick blue_ball_1 room_4 - we're now holding an object in room_4 (constraint 4)
11. gotoroom room_4 room_2 red_door_1 - to bring blue_ball_1 to room_2 (constraint 7)
12. drop blue_ball_1 room_2 - blue_ball_1 is now in room_2 (constraint 7)
13. gotoobject green_ball_1 room_2 - to be in front of green_ball_1 for constraint 9
14. pick green_ball_1 room_2 - we need to be holding some object to go back to room_1 and unlock yellow_door_2
15. gotoroom room_2 room_1 yellow_door_1 - go back to room_1
16. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_1 room_3 - to unlock yellow_door_2
17. toggle yellow_door_2 - to unlock yellow_door_2
18. gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_2 - go to room_3
19. gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_3 - to be in front of yellow_ball_1 while holding an object (constraint 6)
20. drop green_ball_1 room_3 - to free our hands
21. pick yellow_ball_1 room_3 - to hold yellow_ball_1 for constraint 9
22. gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_2 - go back to room_1
23. gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1 - go to room_2
24. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_2 - now we have blue_ball_1 in room_2 (constraint 7) and we're going to pick it up
25. drop yellow_ball_1 room_2 - drop yellow_ball_1 to pick up blue_ball_1
26. gotoobject green_ball_1 room_2 - to be in front of green_ball_1
27. pick yellow_ball_1 room_2 - to hold yellow_ball_1 while in front of green_ball_1 (constraint 9)
28. drop yellow_ball_1 room_2 - drop it to pick up blue_ball_1
29. pick blue_ball_1 room_2 - pick up blue_ball_1
30. gotoroom room_2 room_1 yellow_door_1 - go back to room_1
31. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_1 room_3 - to go to yellow_door_2 while holding blue_ball_1 (constraint 2)
32. gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_2 - this is redundant, we've already unlocked yellow_door_2, but it's here for clarity
33. gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_2 - go back to room_1
34. drop blue_ball_1 room_1 - drop blue_ball_1
35. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1 - finally satisfy our goal

Hmm wait, there's an issue here. This plan doesn't satisfy constraint 8: "Either blue_ball_1 is in room_3 OR we are holding blue_box_1". Let's adjust our plan.

Actually, there's more than one issue. I should carefully go over each constraint again and make sure they're all satisfied at some point in the plan.

Constraint 1: Either grey_box_1 is in room_3 OR we are in front of purple_box_1.
- We are in front of purple_box_1 in step 5.

Constraint 2: We are holding blue_ball_1 AND yellow_door_2 is unlocked.
- We unlock yellow_door_2 in step 17 and hold blue_ball_1 in step 29, but not together. I need to fix this.

Constraint 3: We are in front of yellow_door_1.
- We are in front of yellow_door_1 in step 2.

Constraint 4: We are in room_4 AND holding some object.
- We are in room_4 holding blue_ball_1 in step 10.

Constraint 5: Either we are in front of purple_box_1 OR red_door_1 is unlocked.
- We are in front of purple_box_1 in step 5 and we unlock red_door_1 in step 7.

Constraint 6: We are in front of yellow_ball_1 AND holding some object.
- We are in front of yellow_ball_1 while holding green_ball_1 in step 19.

Constraint 7: blue_ball_1 is in room_2.
- We place blue_ball_1 in room_2 in step 12.

Constraint 8: Either blue_ball_1 is in room_3 OR we are holding blue_box_1.
- We never satisfy this condition in the plan. I need to fix this.

Constraint 9: We are holding yellow_ball_1 AND in front of green_ball_1.
- We hold yellow_ball_1 and are in front of green_ball_1 in step 27.

Constraint 10: yellow_door_1 is not locked.
- We unlock yellow_door_1 in step 3.

So I need to fix constraints 2 and 8. Let's redo part of the plan to take these into account.

Wait, I'm realizing now that there's a problem with my plan. Once we drop an object, we need to be in front of it to pick it up again. Let me be more careful about this.

Let's start fresh:

1. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1 - to be in front of a blue box, our eventual goal
2. pick blue_box_1 room_1 - pick up the blue box, which satisfies constraint 8
3. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2 - go to yellow_door_1 to unlock it
4. toggle yellow_door_1 - unlock yellow_door_1, which satisfies constraint 10
5. gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1 - go to room_2
6. gotoobject purple_box_1 room_2 - go to purple_box_1, which satisfies constraints 1 and 5
7. gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_4 - go to red_door_1 to unlock it
8. toggle red_door_1 - unlock red_door_1, which also satisfies constraint 5
9. gotoroom room_2 room_4 red_door_1 - go to room_4 while holding blue_box_1, which satisfies constraint 4
10. drop blue_box_1 room_4 - drop blue_box_1
11. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_4 - go to blue_ball_1
12. pick blue_ball_1 room_4 - pick up blue_ball_1
13. gotoroom room_4 room_2 red_door_1 - go back to room_2
14. drop blue_ball_1 room_2 - place blue_ball_1 in room_2, which satisfies constraint 7
15. gotoobject green_ball_1 room_2 - go to green_ball_1
16. pick green_ball_1 room_2 - pick up green_ball_1
17. gotoroom room_2 room_1 yellow_door_1 - go back to room_1
18. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_1 room_3 - go to yellow_door_2 to unlock it
19. toggle yellow_door_2 - unlock yellow_door_2
20. gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_2 - go to room_3
21. gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_3 - go to yellow_ball_1 while holding green_ball_1, which satisfies constraint 6
22. drop green_ball_1 room_3 - drop green_ball_1
23. pick yellow_ball_1 room_3 - pick up yellow_ball_1
24. gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_2 - go back to room_1
25. gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1 - go to room_2
26. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_2 - go to blue_ball_1
27. pick blue_ball_1 room_2 - pick up blue_ball_1
28. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_1 - go back to yellow_door_1
29. gotoroom room_2 room_1 yellow_door_1 - go to room_1
30. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_1 room_3 - go to yellow_door_2 while holding blue_ball_1, which satisfies constraint 2
31. gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_2 - go to room_3 with blue_ball_1, which satisfies part of constraint 8
32. gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_2 - go back to room_1
33. drop blue_ball_1 room_1 - drop blue_ball_1
34. gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1 - go to room_2
35. gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2 - if yellow_ball_1 is in room_2, go to it
36. drop yellow_ball_1 room_2 - drop yellow_ball_1 if we're holding it
37. gotoobject green_ball_1 room_2 - go to green_ball_1
38. pick yellow_ball_1 room_2 - pick up yellow_ball_1
39. gotoempty - go to an empty position in front of green_ball_1, which satisfies constraint 9
40. gotoroom room_2 room_1 yellow_door_1 - go back to room_1
41. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1 - go to blue_box_1
42. drop yellow_ball_1 room_1 - drop yellow_ball_1
43. pick blue_box_1 room_1 - pick up blue_box_1, although this shouldn't be necessary if it's still in room_1
44. gotoempty - go to an empty position in front of a blue box, which satisfies the goal

Wait, I'm getting confused about the state of objects. Let me track the state more carefully:

Initial state:
- room_1: blue_box_1, blue_box_2
- room_2: purple_box_1, green_ball_1
- room_3: yellow_ball_1, blue_box_3
- room_4: blue_ball_1, grey_box_1
- You are in room_1, not holding anything.

Let me start over and be more careful:

1. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1 - go to blue_box_1
2. pick blue_box_1 room_1 - pick up blue_box_1, which satisfies constraint 8
3. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2 - go to yellow_door_1
4. toggle yellow_door_1 - unlock yellow_door_1, which satisfies constraints 3 and 10
5. gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1 - go to room_2
6. gotoobject purple_box_1 room_2 - go to purple_box_1, which satisfies constraints 1 and 5
7. gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_4 - go to red_door_1
8. toggle red_door_1 - unlock red_door_1, which also satisfies constraint 5
9. gotoroom room_2 room_4 red_door_1 - go to room_4 while holding blue_box_1, which satisfies constraint 4
10. drop blue_box_1 room_4 - drop blue_box_1, now we have blue_box_1 in room_4
11. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_4 - go to blue_ball_1
12. pick blue_ball_1 room_4 - pick up blue_ball_1
13. gotoroom room_4 room_2 red_door_1 - go back to room_2
14. drop blue_ball_1 room_2 - place blue_ball_1 in room_2, which satisfies constraint 7
15. gotoobject green_ball_1 room_2 - go to green_ball_1
16. pick green_ball_1 room_2 - pick up green_ball_1
17. gotoroom room_2 room_1 yellow_door_1 - go back to room_1
18. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_1 room_3 - go to yellow_door_2
19. toggle yellow_door_2 - unlock yellow_door_2
20. gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_2 - go to room_3
21. gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_3 - go to yellow_ball_1 while holding green_ball_1, which satisfies constraint 6
22. drop green_ball_1 room_3 - drop green_ball_1
23. pick yellow_ball_1 room_3 - pick up yellow_ball_1
24. gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_2 - go back to room_1
25. gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1 - go to room_2
26. gotoobject green_ball_1 room_2 - I realize there's an issue: we left green_ball_1 in room_3, so we can't go to it in room_2
27. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_2 - go to blue_ball_1
28. pick blue_ball_1 room_2 - pick up blue_ball_1
29. gotoroom room_2 room_1 yellow_door_1 - go back to room_1
30. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_1 room_3 - go to yellow_door_2 while holding blue_ball_1
31. gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_2 - go to room_3 with blue_ball_1, which satisfies constraint 2
32. drop blue_ball_1 room_3 - drop blue_ball_1 in room_3, which satisfies part of constraint 8
33. gotoobject green_ball_1 room_3 - go to green_ball_1 in room_3, while holding yellow_ball_1 (we picked it up earlier)
34. gotoodoor yellow_door_2 room_3 room_1 - go back to yellow_door_2
35. gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_2 - go back to room_1
36. gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1 - go to room_2
37. gotoobject green_ball_1 room_2 - go to green_ball_1 if it's in room_2, but I realize again we left it in room_3
...

I seem to be running into consistency issues. Let me start over and track the state carefully.

Initial state:
- room_1: blue_box_1, blue_box_2
- room_2: purple_box_1, green_ball_1
- room_3: yellow_ball_1, blue_box_3
- room_4: blue_ball_1, grey_box_1
- You are in room_1, not holding anything.

Here's the plan:

7. gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_4 - go to red_door_1
8. toggle red_door_1 - unlock red_door_1, which also satisfies constraint 5 (red_door_1 is unlocked)
9. gotoroom room_2 room_4 red_door_1 - go to room_4 while holding blue_box_1, which satisfies constraint 4 (in room_4 holding an object)
   State: You are in room_4, holding blue_box_1.
10. gotoempty - go to an empty position
11. drop blue_box_1 room_4 - drop blue_box_1, now we have blue_box_1 in room_4
   State: You are in room_4, not holding anything, blue_box_1 is in room_4.
12. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_4 - go to blue_ball_1
13. pick blue_ball_1 room_4 - pick up blue_ball_1
    State: You are in room_4, holding blue_ball_1.
14. gotoroom room_4 room_2 red_door_1 - go back to room_2
    State: You are in room_2, holding blue_ball_1.
15. gotoempty - go to an empty position
16. drop blue_ball_1 room_2 - place blue_ball_1 in room_2, which satisfies constraint 7 (blue_ball_1 is in room_2)
    State: You are in room_2, not holding anything, blue_ball_1 is in room_2.
17. gotoobject green_ball_1 room_2 - go to green_ball_1

    State: You are in room_1, holding green_ball_1.
20. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_1 room_3 - go to yellow_door_2
21. toggle yellow_door_2 - unlock yellow_door_2
22. gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_2 - go to room_3
    State: You are in room_3, holding green_ball_1.
23. gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_3 - go to yellow_ball_1 while holding green_ball_1, which satisfies constraint 6 (in front of yellow_ball_1 holding an object)
24. gotoempty - go to an empty position

    State: You are in room_3, not holding anything, green_ball_1 is in room_3.

    State: You are in room_1, holding yellow_ball_1.
29. gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1 - go to room_2
    State: You are in room_2, holding yellow_ball_1.
30. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_2 - go to blue_ball_1
31. pick blue_ball_1 room_2 - I realize we can't pick up blue_ball_1 because we're already holding yellow_ball_1

Let me restart:

Initial state:
- room_1: blue_box_1, blue_box_2
- room_2: purple_box_1, green_ball_1
- room_3: yellow_ball_1, blue_box_3
- room_4: blue_ball_1, grey_box_1
- You are in room_1, not holding anything.

Here's the plan to satisfy all constraints:

1. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1 - go to blue_box_1

   State: You are in room_4, holding blue_box_1.
10. gotoempty - go to an empty position
11. drop blue_box_1 room_4 - drop blue_box_1
    State: You are in room_4, not holding anything, blue_box_1 is in room_4.
12. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_4 - go to blue_ball_1
13. pick blue_ball_1 room_4 - pick up blue_ball_1
    State: You are in room_4, holding blue_ball_1.
14. gotoroom room_4 room_2 red_door_1 - go back to room_2
    State: You are in room_2, holding blue_ball_1.
15. gotoempty - go to an empty position
16. drop blue_ball_1 room_2 - place blue_ball_1 in room_2, which satisfies constraint 7 (blue_ball_1 is in room_2)
    State: You are in room_2, not holding anything, blue_ball_1 is in room_2.
17. gotoobject green_ball_1 room_2 - go to green_ball_1

    State: You are in room_2, holding green_ball_1.
19. gotoroom room_2 room_1 yellow_door_1 - go back to room_1
    State: You are in room_1, holding green_ball_1.
20. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_1 room_3 - go to yellow_door_2
21. toggle yellow_door_2 - unlock yellow_door_2
22. gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_2 - go to room_3
    State: You are in room_3, holding green_ball_1.

29. gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1 - go to room_2
    State: You are in room_2, holding yellow_ball_1.
30. gotoobject green_ball_1 room_2 - but green_ball_1 is now in room_3, not room_2
    
I realize there's a problem with my plan. I moved green_ball_1 from room_2 to room_3 in steps 17-25, but then I'm trying to go to it in room_2 in step 30. Let me revise:

Initial state:
- room_1: blue_box_1, blue_box_2
- room_2: purple_box_1, green_ball_1
- room_3: yellow_ball_1, blue_box_3
- room_4: blue_ball_1, grey_box_1
- You are in room_1, not holding anything.

Here's a more careful plan:

1. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1 - go to blue_box_1
2. pick blue_box_1 room_1 - pick up blue_box_1, which satisfies constraint 8 (holding blue_box_1)
   State: In room_1, holding blue_box_1.
3. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2 - go to yellow_door_1
4. toggle yellow_door_1 - unlock yellow_door_1, which satisfies constraints 3 (in front of yellow_door_1) and 10 (yellow_door_1 is unlocked)
5. gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1 - go to room_2
   State: In room_2, holding blue_box_1.
6. gotoobject purple_box_1 room_2 - go to purple_box_1, which satisfies constraints 1 and 5 (in front of purple_box_1)
7. gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_4 - go to red_door_1
8. toggle red_door_1 - unlock red_door_1, which also satisfies constraint 5 (red_door_1 is unlocked)
9. gotoroom room_2 room_4 red_door_1 - go to room_4 while holding blue_box_1, which satisfies constraint 4 (in room_4 holding an object)
   State: In room_4, holding blue_box_1.
10. gotoempty - go to an empty position
11. drop blue_box_1 room_4 - drop blue_box_1
    State: In room_4, not holding anything, blue_box_1 is in room_4.
12. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_4 - go to blue_ball_1
13. pick blue_ball_1 room_4 - pick up blue_ball_1
    State: In room_4, holding blue_ball_1.
14. gotoroom room_4 room_2 red_door_1 - go back to room_2
    State: In room_2, holding blue_ball_1.
15. gotoempty - go to an empty position
16. drop blue_ball_1 room_2 - place blue_ball_1 in room_2, which satisfies constraint 7 (blue_ball_1 is in room_2)
    State: In room_2, not holding anything, blue_ball_1 is in room_2.
17. gotoroom room_2 room_1 yellow_door_1 - go back to room_1
    State: In room_1, not holding anything.
18. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_1 room_3 - go to yellow_door_2
19. toggle yellow_door_2 - unlock yellow_door_2
20. gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_2 - go to room_3
    State: In room_3, not holding anything.
21. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_3 - But blue_ball_1 is in room_2, not room_3...

Let me read the constraints again to make sure I understand what I need to do.

Wait a minute, constraint 8 says: "Either blue_ball_1 is in room_3 OR we are holding blue_box_1". So I can either move blue_ball_1 to room_3 or I can be holding blue_box_1.

Similarly, constraint 2 says: "We are holding blue_ball_1 AND yellow_door_2 is unlocked". So I need to be holding blue_ball_1 while yellow_door_2 is unlocked.

I'll start the plan over one more time:

1. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1 - go to blue_box_1
2. pick blue_box_1 room_1 - pick up blue_box_1, which satisfies constraint 8 (holding blue_box_1)
   State: In room_1, holding blue_box_1.
3. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2 - go to yellow_door_1
4. toggle yellow_door_1 - unlock yellow_door_1, which satisfies constraints 3 (in front of yellow_door_1) and 10 (yellow_door_1 is unlocked)
5. gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1 - go to room_2
   State: In room_2, holding blue_box_1.
6. gotoobject purple_box_1 room_2 - go to purple_box_1, which satisfies constraints 1 and 5 (in front of purple_box_1)
7. gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_4 - go to red_door_1
8. toggle red_door_1 - unlock red_door_1, which also satisfies constraint 5 (red_door_1 is unlocked)
9. gotoroom room_2 room_4 red_door_1 - go to room_4 while holding blue_box_1, which satisfies constraint 4 (in room_4 holding an object)
   State: In room_4, holding blue_box_1.
10. gotoempty - go to an empty position
11. drop blue_box_1 room_4 - drop blue_box_1
    State: In room_4, not holding anything, blue_box_1 is in room_4.
12. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_4 - go to blue_ball_1
13. pick blue_ball_1 room_4 - pick up blue_ball_1
    State: In room_4, holding blue_ball_1.
14. gotoroom room_4 room_2 red_door_1 - go back to room_2
    State: In room_2, holding blue_ball_1.
15. gotoempty - go to an empty position
16. drop blue_ball_1 room_2 - place blue_ball_1 in room_2, which satisfies constraint 7 (blue_ball_1 is in room_2)
    State: In room_2, not holding anything, blue_ball_1 is in room_2.
17. gotoobject green_ball_1 room_2 - go to green_ball_1
18. pick green_ball_1 room_2 - pick up green_ball_1
    State: In room_2, holding green_ball_1.
19. gotoroom room_2 room_1 yellow_door_1 - go back to room_1
    State: In room_1, holding green_ball_1.
20. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_1 room_3 - go to yellow_door_2
21. toggle yellow_door_2 - unlock yellow_door_2
22. gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_2 - go to room_3
    State: In room_3, holding green_ball_1.
23. gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_3 - go to yellow_ball_1 while holding green_ball_1, which satisfies constraint 6 (in front of yellow_ball_1 holding an object)
24. gotoempty - go to an empty position
25. drop green_ball_1 room_3 - drop green_ball_1
    State: In room_3, not holding anything, green_ball_1 is in room_3.
26. gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_3 - go to yellow_ball_1
27. pick yellow_ball_1 room_3 - pick up yellow_ball_1
    State: In room_3, holding yellow_ball_1.
28. gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_2 - go back to room_1
    State: In room_1, holding yellow_ball_1.
29. gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1 - go to room_2
    State: In room_2, holding yellow_ball_1.
30. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_2 - go to blue_ball_1 (it's in room_2 now)
31. gotoempty - go to an empty position
32. drop yellow_ball_1 room_2 - drop yellow_ball_1
    State: In room_2, not holding anything, yellow_ball_1 is in room_2.
33. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_2 - go to blue_ball_1
34. pick blue_ball_1 room_2 - pick up blue_ball_1
    State: In room_2, holding blue_ball_1.
35. gotoobject green_ball_1 room_2 - but wait, green_ball_1 is in room_3 now...

I'm having a hard time keeping track of where the objects are. Let's do this one more time but even more carefully.

Initial state:
- room_1: blue_box_1, blue_box_2
- room_2: purple_box_1, green_ball_1
- room_3: yellow_ball_1, blue_box_3
- room_4: blue_ball_1, grey_box_1
- You are in room_1, not holding anything.

Here's the plan:

1. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1 - go to blue_box_1
2. pick blue_box_1 room_1 - pick up blue_box_1, which satisfies constraint 8 (holding blue_box_1)
   State update: In room_1, holding blue_box_1. blue_box_2 is still in room_1.
3. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2 - go to yellow_door_1
4. toggle yellow_door_1 - unlock yellow_door_1, which satisfies constraints 3 (in front of yellow_door_1) and 10 (yellow_door_1 is unlocked)
5. gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1 - go to room_2

15. gotoempty - go to an empty position
16. drop blue_ball_1 room_2 - place blue_ball_1 in room_2, which satisfies constraint 7 (blue_ball_1 is in room_2)

20. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_1 room_3 - go to yellow_door_2
21. toggle yellow_door_2 - unlock yellow_door_2
22. gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_2 - go to room_3

24. gotoempty - go to an empty position
25. drop green_ball_1 room_3 - drop green_ball_1
    State update: In room_3, not holding anything. yellow_ball_1, blue_box_3, and green_ball_1 are in room_3.
26. gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_3 - go to yellow_ball_1
27. pick yellow_ball_1 room_3 - pick up yellow_ball_1
    State update: In room_3, holding yellow_ball_1. blue_box_3 and green_ball_1 are in room_3.
28. gotoobject green_ball_1 room_3 - go to green_ball_1 while holding yellow_ball_1, which satisfies constraint 9 (holding yellow_ball_1 in front of green_ball_1)
29. gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_2 - go back to room_1
    State update: In room_1, holding yellow_ball_1. blue_box_2 is in room_1.
30. gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1 - go to room_2
    State update: In room_2, holding yellow_ball_1. purple_box_1 and blue_ball_1 are in room_2.
31. gotoempty - go to an empty position
32. drop yellow_ball_1 room_2 - drop yellow_ball_1
    State update: In room_2, not holding anything. purple_box_1, blue_ball_1, and yellow_ball_1 are in room_2.
33. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_2 - go to blue_ball_1
34. pick blue_ball_1 room_2 - pick up blue_ball_1
    State update: In room_2, holding blue_ball_1. purple_box_1 and yellow_ball_1 are in room_2.
35. gotoroom room_2 room_1 yellow_door_1 - go back to room_1
    State update: In room_1, holding blue_ball_1. blue_box_2 is in room_1.
36. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_1 room_3 - go to yellow_door_2 while holding blue_ball_1 and with yellow_door_2 unlocked, which satisfies constraint 2 (holding blue_ball_1 and yellow_door_2 is unlocked)
37. gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_2 - go to room_3 with blue_ball_1
    State update: In room_3, holding blue_ball_1. blue_box_3 and green_ball_1 are in room_3.
38. gotoempty - go to an empty position

    State update: In room_3, not holding anything. blue_box_3, green_ball_1, and blue_ball_1 are in room_3.
40. gotoobject blue_box_3 room_3 - go to blue_box_3
41. pick blue_box_3 room_3 - pick up blue_box_3

42. gotoempty - go to an empty position
43. drop blue_box_3 room_3 - drop blue_box_3
    State update: In room_3, not holding anything. green_ball_1, blue_ball_1, and blue_box_3 are in room_3.
44. gotoobject blue_box_3 room_3 - go to blue_box_3, which satisfies the goal (in front of a blue box)

Actually, I don't think we need to pick up blue_box_3 just to drop it again. We just need to be in front of it to satisfy the goal. Let me clean up the plan:

1. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1 - go to blue_box_1
2. pick blue_box_1 room_1 - pick up blue_box_1, which satisfies constraint 8 (holding blue_box_1)
3. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2 - go to yellow_door_1
4. toggle yellow_door_1 - unlock yellow_door_1, which satisfies constraints 3 (in front of yellow_door_1) and 10 (yellow_door_1 is unlocked)
5. gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1 - go to room_2
6. gotoobject purple_box_1 room_2 - go to purple_box_1, which satisfies constraints 1 and 5 (in front of purple_box_1)
7. gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_4 - go to red_door_1
8. toggle red_door_1 - unlock red_door_1, which also satisfies constraint 5 (red_door_1 is unlocked)
9. gotoroom room_2 room_4 red_door_1 - go to room_4 while holding blue_box_1, which satisfies constraint 4 (in room_4 holding an object)
10. gotoempty - go to an empty position
11. drop blue_box_1 room_4 - drop blue_box_1
12. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_4 - go to blue_ball_1
13. pick blue_ball_1 room_4 - pick up blue_ball_1
14. gotoroom room_4 room_2 red_door_1 - go back to room_2
15. gotoempty - go to an empty position
16. drop blue_ball_1 room_2 - place blue_ball_1 in room_2, which satisfies constraint 7 (blue_ball_1 is in room_2)
17. gotoobject green_ball_1 room_2 - go to green_ball_1
18. pick green_ball_1 room_2 - pick up green_ball_1
19. gotoroom room_2 room_1 yellow_door_1 - go back to room_1
20. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_1 room_3 - go to yellow_door_2
21. toggle yellow_door_2 - unlock yellow_door_2
22. gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_2 - go to room_3
23. gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_3 - go to yellow_ball_1 while holding green_ball_1, which satisfies constraint 6 (in front of yellow_ball_1 holding an object)
24. gotoempty - go to an empty position
25. drop green_ball_1 room_3 - drop green_ball_1
26. gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_3 - go to yellow_ball_1
27. pick yellow_ball_1 room_3 - pick up yellow_ball_1
28. gotoobject green_ball_1 room_3 - go to green_ball_1 while holding yellow_ball_1, which satisfies constraint 9 (holding yellow_ball_1 in front of green_ball_1)
29. gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_2 - go back to room_1
30. gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1 - go to room_2
31. gotoempty - go to an empty position
32. drop yellow_ball_1 room_2 - drop yellow_ball_1
33. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_2 - go to blue_ball_1
34. pick blue_ball_1 room_2 - pick up blue_ball_1
35. gotoroom room_2 room_1 yellow_door_1 - go back to room_1
36. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_1 room_3 - go to yellow_door_2 while holding blue_ball_1 and with yellow_door_2 unlocked, which satisfies constraint 2 (holding blue_ball_1 and yellow_door_2 is unlocked)
37. gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_2 - go to room_3 with blue_ball_1
38. gotoempty - go to an empty position
39. drop blue_ball_1 room_3 - drop blue_ball_1 in room_3, which satisfies constraint 8 (blue_ball_1 is in room_3)
40. gotoobject blue_box_3 room_3 - go to blue_box_3, which satisfies the goal (in front of a blue box)

Let me check that all constraints are satisfied at some point in the plan:

1. Either grey_box_1 is in room_3 OR we are in front of purple_box_1.
   - Satisfied in step 6 (in front of purple_box_1).

2. We are holding blue_ball_1 AND yellow_door_2 is unlocked.
   - Satisfied in step 36 (holding blue_ball_1 and yellow_door_2 is unlocked).

3. We are in front of yellow_door_1.
   - Satisfied in step 3 (in front of yellow_door_1).

4. We are in room_4 AND holding some object.
   - Satisfied in step 9 (in room_4 holding blue_box_1).

5. Either we are in front of purple_box_1 OR red_door_1 is unlocked.
   - Satisfied in step 6 (in front of purple_box_1) and step 8 (red_door_1 is unlocked).

6. We are in front of yellow_ball_1 AND holding some object.
   - Satisfied in step 23 (in front of yellow_ball_1 holding green_ball_1).

7. blue_ball_1 is in room_2.
   - Satisfied in step 16 (blue_ball_1 is placed in room_2).

8. Either blue_ball_1 is in room_3 OR we are holding blue_box_1.
   - Satisfied in step 2 (holding blue_box_1) and step 39 (blue_ball_1 is in room_3).

9. We are holding yellow_ball_1 AND in front of green_ball_1.
   - Satisfied in step 28 (holding yellow_ball_1 in front of green_ball_1).

10. yellow_door_1 is not locked.
    - Satisfied in step 4 (yellow_door_1 is unlocked).

Yes, all constraints are satisfied. And the goal is satisfied in the final step (step 40) where we are in front of blue_box_3, which is blue.

Let me double-check the format of my actions and make sure they're all valid:

1. `gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1` - go to blue_box_1
   - We are in room_1, and blue_box_1 is in room_1, so this is valid.

2. `pick blue_box_1 room_1` - pick up blue_box_1
   - We are in room_1, in front of blue_box_1, and not holding anything, so this is valid.

3. `gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2` - go to yellow_door_1
   - We are in room_1, and yellow_door_1 connects room_1 and room_2, so this is valid.

4. `toggle yellow_door_1` - unlock yellow_door_1
   - We are in front of yellow_door_1, so this is valid.

5. `gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1` - go to room_2
   - We are in room_1, yellow_door_1 connects room_1 and room_2, and yellow_door_1 is unlocked, so this is valid.

Actually I think I don't need step 20 anymore, because I'm already in front of yellow_door_2 from step 18. Let me double-check the entire plan again to make sure it's all valid and optimal...

Actually, I just noticed a typo in step 36: it should be "go to yellow_door_2," not "got to yellow_door_2." Let me fix this.

After reviewing the plan, I believe it's valid and all constraints are satisfied at some point in the plan. The goal is satisfied in the final step where we are in front of blue_box_3, which is blue.
