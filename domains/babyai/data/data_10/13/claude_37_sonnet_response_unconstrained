Let's understand the task:

1. We are in a 2D gridworld with 4 rooms arranged in a square formation. There are doors connecting pairs of rooms, and there are various objects (boxes and balls) in the rooms.
2. We start in room_4.
3. The goal is to be in front of a red door (which is not locked).
4. The actions available are: gotoobject, gotoempty, gotodoor, gotoroom, pick, drop, and toggle.

First, let's identify the red door in the world:
- red_door_1 connects room_4 and room_2
- It is initially locked

To achieve our goal, we need to:
1. First, go to the red door from our starting position in room_4.
2. Then, toggle the red door to unlock it.

Here's the plan:

1. We are in room_4, and we need to find the red door (red_door_1) which connects room_4 and room_2.
2. Use gotodoor to go to red_door_1.
3. Use toggle to unlock red_door_1.

Let's check the preconditions for these actions:

For gotodoor:
- We can go to a door d if:
  (i) We are in a room which door d is connecting with another room. 
      - We are in room_4, and red_door_1 connects room_4 and room_2. Satisfied.
  (ii) There is no object blocking the position in front of d in the room you are currently in.
      - We don't have information about any object blocking red_door_1, so we'll assume it's not blocked.

For toggle:
- We can toggle a door d if we are in front of d.
  - After using gotodoor, we will be in front of red_door_1. Satisfied.

The effects of our actions will be:
1. gotodoor: We will be in front of red_door_1.
2. toggle: red_door_1 will be unlocked.

These effects align with our goal: we will be in front of red_door_1, which is a red door, and it will not be locked.

So, our plan is:
gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2
toggle red_door_1

Time to write the plan.

Actually, let me think about this again. For the gotodoor action, the format appears to be:
"gotodoor d r1 r2": Go in front of door d, connecting room r1 to room r2.

So, we need to specify both rooms connected by the door. Since we are in room_4, our action would be:
gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2

After using this action, we will be in front of red_door_1.

Next, we'll use toggle:
toggle red_door_1

This action should unlock red_door_1, satisfying our goal.

So, the final plan is:
gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2
toggle red_door_1
