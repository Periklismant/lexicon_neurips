Okay, let's tackle this planning problem step by step. The goal is to end up in front of a red door that's unlocked. There are a bunch of constraints to satisfy along the way, so I need to make sure each one is met. Let me start by understanding the initial state and the goal.

Starting in room_4. The doors are all locked initially. The red door (red_door_1) connects room_2 and room_4. So, to get to room_2, I need to unlock that door. But first, maybe I need to unlock other doors to move around.

Constraints:

1. red_door_1 must be locked in at least one state. Since it starts locked, maybe that's already covered, but if we unlock it later, we have to ensure that there's a state where it was locked. Wait, the initial state has it locked, so that's satisfied as long as we don't unlock it before some other constraint requires it. But let me check other constraints.

2. If red_door_1 is locked in some state, then grey_door_1 must be unlocked in that state or later. Since red_door_1 starts locked, we need to ensure that grey_door_1 is unlocked at some point after. But grey_door_1 is also locked initially, so we need to toggle it.

3. red_door_1 must be unlocked in at least one state. So we have to unlock it eventually.

4. If red_door_1 is unlocked, then there must be a prior state where purple_ball_1 is in room_2. Purple_ball_1 starts in room_1. So we need to move it to room_2 before unlocking red_door_1.

5. Must be in front of red_door_1 in some state. The final goal requires being in front of a red door (d) which is unlocked, so that's covered if we end up there. But maybe there's an intermediate step where we are in front of it while locked.

6. If in front of red_door_1 in some state, then must have been in front of blue_door_1 earlier. So before any step where we are at red_door_1, we need to have been at blue_door_1.

7. yellow_door_1 must be unlocked at some point. It starts locked, so need to toggle it.

8. Must hold an object at some state. So pick up something.

9. At some state, either in front of grey_ball_1 or holding purple_ball_1. Grey_ball_1 is in room_1. So need to go there.

10. At some state, hold an object and specifically hold green_box_1. So pick up green_box_1 (in room_4 initially). That's possible.

11. At some state, either grey_door_1 is unlocked or in front of purple_box_1. Purple_box_1 is in room_2. So either unlock grey_door_1 or go to purple_box_1.

12. At some state, hold purple_ball_1 or any object. Since constraint 9 requires either holding purple_ball_1 or being in front of grey_ball_1, maybe holding purple_ball_1 would cover both.

13. At some state, hold red_ball_2 or be in front of green_box_1. Since green_box_1 is in room_4, maybe we can just go in front of it early on.

Now, let's outline the steps.

Starting in room_4. The green_box_1 is here. So maybe first, satisfy constraint 13 by going to green_box_1. Then pick it up (satisfying 8, 10, and 13 if we hold it). But let's see.

But also, to unlock doors, we need to be in front of them. So to toggle a door, we have to be in front of it. But doors are in rooms. For example, red_door_1 connects room_2 and room_4. So to access it from room_4, we need to go in front of it. But if the door is locked, can we even get in front of it? Wait, the preconditions for gotodoor: you can go in front of a door d if you're in a room connected by d and no object is blocking the position in front of d. Since the initial state doesn't mention any objects blocking doors, maybe all doors are accessible to be in front of, even if locked.

Wait, the "gotodoor d r1 r2" action's precondition is (i) you are in a room connected by d, and (ii) no object is blocking the position in front of d in the current room. So if the door is in room_4 (since red_door_1 connects room_4 and room_2), then from room_4, we can go to front of red_door_1 as long as no object is blocking. But in room_4, the objects are green_box_1, blue_box_1, red_ball_2. Are they blocking the door? The initial state doesn't say. The problem statement says that objects may block doors if they are in front. So unless specified, perhaps doors are not blocked. So maybe we can go to front of red_door_1 from room_4.

But initially, red_door_1 is locked. So to toggle it, we need to be in front of it, then toggle. But if we can get there, we can unlock it. But according to constraint 4, before unlocking red_door_1, we need to have purple_ball_1 in room_2. So we need to move purple_ball_1 from room_1 to room_2 first.

So to get to room_1, we need to navigate through doors. Let's see the connections:

room_1 is connected to room_2 via yellow_door_1, and to room_3 via blue_door_1. room_2 is connected to room_4 via red_door_1, and room_3 is connected to room_4 via grey_door_1.

Starting in room_4. To get to room_1, possible paths:

From room_4 to room_2 via red_door_1 (but it's locked), or to room_3 via grey_door_1 (also locked). So first, need to unlock either grey_door_1 or red_door_1. But red_door_1's unlock would require being in front of it, but to unlock it, we need to be in front of it. However, unlocking red_door_1 would require that before that, purple_ball_1 is in room_2. So maybe we need to unlock another door first.

Alternatively, unlock grey_door_1. Grey_door_1 connects room_3 and room_4. So from room_4, go to front of grey_door_1, toggle it to unlock. Then go to room_3. From room_3, maybe go to room_1 via blue_door_1, but blue_door_1 is locked. So need to unlock blue_door_1. To unlock blue_door_1, need to be in front of it, which is in room_3 or room_1. But room_3 is accessible via grey_door_1 once unlocked. So let's outline:

1. From room_4, go to front of grey_door_1 (since in room_4, connected via grey_door_1 to room_3). So "gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3".

2. Toggle grey_door_1 to unlock it. Now grey_door_1 is unlocked. This satisfies constraint 11, since grey_door_1 is not locked now.

3. Then go from room_4 to room_3 via grey_door_1. "gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1".

4. Now in room_3. The blue_door_1 connects room_3 to room_1. But blue_door_1 is locked. So need to unlock it. Go to front of blue_door_1 in room_3: "gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_1".

5. Toggle blue_door_1 to unlock. Now blue_door_1 is unlocked.

6. Go to room_1 via blue_door_1: "gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_1".

7. Now in room_1. Here, purple_ball_1, grey_ball_1, and purple_ball_2 are present. Need to pick up purple_ball_1 to move it to room_2. But first, go to the object. So "gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_1".

8. Pick up purple_ball_1: "pick purple_ball_1 room_1". This satisfies constraints 8 (holding an object), 9 (holding purple_ball_1), 12 (holding purple_ball_1 or any object), and possibly others.

Now, need to take purple_ball_1 to room_2. To get to room_2 from room_1, the door is yellow_door_1, which is locked. So need to unlock yellow_door_1.

9. Go to front of yellow_door_1 in room_1: "gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2".

10. Toggle yellow_door_1 to unlock. Now yellow_door_1 is unlocked (satisfies constraint 7).

11. Go to room_2 via yellow_door_1: "gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1".

12. Now in room_2. Drop purple_ball_1 here. But to drop, need to be in front of an empty position. So "gotoempty" in room_2, then "drop purple_ball_1 room_2". Now purple_ball_1 is in room_2, satisfying constraint 4's condition for unlocking red_door_1.

Now, need to unlock red_door_1. To do that, need to go to front of red_door_1. But red_door_1 connects room_2 and room_4. So in room_2, go to front of red_door_1.

13. "gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_4".

14. Toggle red_door_1 to unlock it. Now red_door_1 is unlocked. This satisfies constraints 3 (red_door_1 is not locked in this state) and 2 (since red_door_1 was locked before, and now grey_door_1 was unlocked in step 2, which is after the initial state where red_door_1 was locked).

But wait, constraint 2 says if red_door_1 is locked in some state, then grey_door_1 must be not locked in that state or later. In the initial state, red_door_1 is locked, and grey_door_1 is locked. So we need to unlock grey_door_1 at some point after the initial state. Which we did in step 2. So that's satisfied.

Now, the goal is to be in front of a red door that's unlocked. The red_door_1 is now unlocked. So in room_2, after step 13, we are in front of red_door_1. Then after step 14 (toggle), the door is unlocked. But the goal requires being in front of it when it's unlocked. So after toggling, we are still in front of it. So the final state would have us in front of red_door_1, which is unlocked. But wait, the toggle action's effect is to unlock it if it's locked. So after step 14, the door is unlocked, and we are in front of it. So that would satisfy the goal.

But let's check the constraints again.

Constraint 6: if in front of red_door_1 in some state, must have been in front of blue_door_1 earlier. When did we go in front of blue_door_1? That was step 4, when we were in room_3 and went to front of blue_door_1. So that's before step 13 (being in front of red_door_1). So that's satisfied.

Constraint 5: being in front of red_door_1 in some state. That's step 13 and after step 14.

Constraint 10: holding green_box_1 at some point. We haven't done that yet. Because we picked up purple_ball_1 but not green_box_1. So we need to have a step where we hold green_box_1. So maybe after all this, we need to go back to room_4, pick up green_box_1, then drop it. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps during the plan, after dropping purple_ball_1 in room_2, we need to go back to room_4, pick up green_box_1. Let's see.

After step 14 (unlocking red_door_1), we are in front of red_door_1 in room_2. Now, to get back to room_4, we can use red_door_1 since it's unlocked. So:

15. "gotoroom room_2 room_4 red_door_1". Now back in room_4.

16. Then, in room_4, go to green_box_1: "gotoobject green_box_1 room_4".

17. Pick it up: "pick green_box_1 room_4". Now holding green_box_1. This satisfies constraints 8, 10 (hold green_box_1 and some object), and 13 (hold red_ball_2 or in front of green_box_1; since we are holding green_box_1, but not sure if that counts. Wait, constraint 13 says "you are holding red_ball_2 or in front of green_box_1". But when we went to green_box_1 in step 16, that would satisfy the "in front of green_box_1" part. So step 16 satisfies constraint 13. Then picking it up in step 17 satisfies constraint 10.

But we need to make sure that at some state, we are holding green_box_1 and some object. Wait, constraint 10 says "The following conditions are all true: you are holding some object, you are holding green_box_1". Since when we pick green_box_1, we are holding it, so that's true. So step 17 satisfies constraint 10.

But then we need to drop it somewhere. Maybe we can drop it later, but the goal doesn't require it. However, the problem says the plan must end with the goal achieved. So after unlocking red_door_1 and being in front of it, but we added steps to go back to room_4 and pick up green_box_1, which adds unnecessary steps. Wait, but the goal is just to be in front of an unlocked red door. So maybe after step 14, we are already in front of red_door_1 (since we toggled it, which requires being in front of it), and the door is now unlocked. So the final state would satisfy the goal. But wait, after step 14 (toggle), we are still in front of red_door_1. So the final action is step 14, and the state after that has us in front of red_door_1, which is unlocked. That would meet the goal.

But then the steps after that (15-17) are unnecessary. So perhaps I made a mistake. Let me re-examine.

After step 14, the plan would be:

1. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3

2. toggle grey_door_1

3. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1

4. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_1

5. toggle blue_door_1

6. gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_1

7. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_1

8. pick purple_ball_1 room_1

9. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2

10. toggle yellow_door_1

11. gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1

12. gotoempty room_2 (assuming room_2 has an empty spot)

13. drop purple_ball_1 room_2

14. gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_4

15. toggle red_door_1

At this point, after step 15, we are in front of red_door_1, which is now unlocked. So the goal is achieved. But we need to check all constraints.

Let's check each constraint:

- Constraint 1: red_door_1 is locked in at least one state. Initially, it's locked. So yes.

- Constraint 2: If red_door_1 is locked in some state, then grey_door_1 must be unlocked in that state or later. The initial state has red_door_1 locked, and in step 2, we unlock grey_door_1, which is after the initial state. So yes.

- Constraint 3: red_door_1 is unlocked in at least one state. Yes, after step 15.

- Constraint 4: If red_door_1 is unlocked, then prior state with purple_ball_1 in room_2. After step 13, purple_ball_1 is in room_2. Step 13 is before step 15. So yes.

- Constraint 5: Be in front of red_door_1. Step 14 and 15. Yes.

- Constraint 6: If in front of red_door_1, must have been in front of blue_door_1 earlier. Step 4 is gotodoor blue_door_1. Yes.

- Constraint 7: yellow_door_1 unlocked. Step 10. Yes.

- Constraint 8: Hold some object. Steps 8 (holding purple_ball_1) and step 8-13 (carrying it). Yes.

- Constraint 9: Be in front of grey_ball_1 or holding purple_ball_1. We hold purple_ball_1 from step 8 to step 13. So yes.

- Constraint 10: Hold some object and green_box_1. Wait, we never picked up green_box_1. Oops, missed that. So this is a problem. How to satisfy this?

Ah, right. Constraint 10 requires at some state to hold an object and specifically green_box_1. So we need to pick up green_box_1.

But in the current plan, we didn't do that. So we need to adjust the plan.

So after achieving the goal, but before ending, we need to pick up green_box_1. But the goal is to end in front of unlocked red door. So maybe we need to do that before the final steps.

But how? Let's think.

Alternative approach: After unlocking red_door_1 and being in front of it (step 15), we need to go back to room_4 to pick up green_box_1. But that would require leaving the front of the door and going through the door.

Wait, after step 15, we are in front of red_door_1 in room_2. The door is unlocked, so we can go back to room_4. Then in room_4, go to green_box_1, pick it up, then maybe drop it again. But that adds steps. However, the plan must be optimal (shortest possible). So perhaps there's a way to incorporate this earlier.

Alternatively, when we are in room_4 initially, before moving to room_3, pick up green_box_1. Let's see.

But in room_4, we have green_box_1. So:

1. In room_4, gotoobject green_box_1 room_4.

2. pick green_box_1 room_4. Now holding it. Then drop it to proceed. But why? Because we need to carry other objects. But maybe not. Let's see.

But if we pick up green_box_1 early, we can't pick up purple_ball_1 later. Because you can only hold one object at a time. So we have to drop it somewhere.

Alternatively, after unlocking red_door_1 and achieving the goal, go back to room_4, pick up green_box_1, then drop it. But this adds steps.

Wait, the constraint is that at some state, we are holding some object and green_box_1. So the moment we pick up green_box_1, that's the state. Even if we drop it later.

So maybe:

After step 3 (in room_3), before proceeding to blue_door_1, go back to room_4, pick up green_box_1, then drop it. But that's adding steps.

Alternatively, after step 15 (unlock red_door_1), go back to room_4, pick up green_box_1, then return to room_2 and front of red_door_1.

But this would add steps. However, maybe it's necessary.

Let's try:

After step 15, we are in front of red_door_1 in room_2, which is unlocked. Now, to satisfy constraint 10:

16. gotoroom room_2 room_4 red_door_1 (go back to room_4)

17. gotoobject green_box_1 room_4

18. pick green_box_1 room_4 (now holding it, satisfies constraint 10)

19. drop green_box_1 room_4 (optional, but not needed for goal)

20. gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2

21. toggle red_door_1 (but it's already unlocked, so this would lock it again. Not good.)

Wait, but the goal requires that the door is unlocked. So after step 15, we can't toggle it again. So step 20 would be gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2, then gotoroom to room_2 again. But this complicates things.

Alternatively, perhaps during the initial steps in room_4, before moving to room_3, we can pick up green_box_1 and then drop it, just to satisfy the constraint. Let's see.

Original steps modified:

Starting in room_4.

1. gotoobject green_box_1 room_4

2. pick green_box_1 room_4 (now holding it, satisfies constraints 8, 10, 13)

3. drop green_box_1 room_4 (to free hands)

Then proceed as before.

But this adds steps but allows us to satisfy constraint 10. However, this might not be optimal. But given that the problem requires an optimal plan, we need the shortest possible.

Alternative plan:

1. In room_4, go to green_box_1.

2. Pick it up. Now, we are holding green_box_1 (satisfies constraints 8, 10, 13).

3. Drop it.

Then proceed to unlock grey_door_1, etc. But this adds three steps. Maybe there's a smarter way.

Alternatively, after dropping purple_ball_1 in room_2, go back to room_4 via red_door_1 (now unlocked), pick up green_box_1, then return to front of red_door_1.

Let's adjust:

After step 13 (drop purple_ball_1 in room_2):

14. gotoroom room_2 room_4 red_door_1 (but red_door_1 is still locked at this point. Wait, no. We haven't unlocked it yet. So this isn't possible. So we need to unlock red_door_1 first.

Wait, steps after dropping purple_ball_1 in room_2:

13. drop purple_ball_1 room_2.

14. gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_4.

15. toggle red_door_1 (unlock it).

Now, in front of red_door_1, which is unlocked. Then:

16. gotoroom room_2 room_4 red_door_1.

17. gotoobject green_box_1 room_4.

18. pick green_box_1 room_4.

19. drop green_box_1 room_4.

20. gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2.

21. toggle red_door_1 (lock it again? No, because the goal requires it to be unlocked. So can't do that.)

Hmm, this complicates things. Alternatively, after step 15 (unlock red_door_1), we are in front of it. That's the goal. But we still need to satisfy constraint 10.

Wait, constraint 10 says "you are holding some object and green_box_1". So in step 18, when we pick up green_box_1, that's the state where we are holding it and some object (since green_box_1 is the object). So that satisfies it. But how to fit that into the plan without adding too many steps.

Alternatively, after unlocking red_door_1 (step 15), we can go back to room_4, pick up green_box_1, and then return to front of red_door_1.

But then the final state must be in front of red_door_1 and it's unlocked. So steps would be:

After step 15:

16. gotoroom room_2 room_4 red_door_1.

17. gotoobject green_box_1 room_4.

18. pick green_box_1 room_4 (satisfy constraint 10).

19. gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2.

20. gotoroom room_4 room_2 red_door_1.

21. gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_4.

Now, after step 21, we are in front of red_door_1, which is unlocked. So the goal is met.

But this adds several steps, making the plan longer. Is there a way to avoid this?

Alternatively, when in room_4 initially, before moving to room_3, pick up green_box_1, carry it through the plan, and drop it somewhere. But this would require carrying it through multiple rooms, which might block other actions since we can't pick up another object while holding it.

Let me try integrating this:

1. In room_4, gotoobject green_box_1 room_4.

2. pick green_box_1 room_4. Now holding it.

3. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3.

4. toggle grey_door_1.

5. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1.

6. Now in room_3, holding green_box_1. Need to go to blue_door_1, but can't pick up anything else until dropping green_box_1.

7. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_1.

8. toggle blue_door_1.

9. gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_1.

10. Now in room_1, still holding green_box_1. Need to drop it to pick up purple_ball_1.

11. gotoempty room_1.

12. drop green_box_1 room_1.

13. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_1.

14. pick purple_ball_1 room_1.

... continue as before.

But this adds many steps and requires moving green_box_1 to room_1, which is unnecessary. This would make the plan longer. Since we need an optimal plan, this is not ideal.

Alternative approach: Find a way to pick up green_box_1 after unlocking red_door_1 but before ending the plan.

After step 15 (toggle red_door_1 to unlock it), we are in front of it in room_2. Then:

16. gotoroom room_2 room_4 red_door_1.

17. gotoobject green_box_1 room_4.

18. pick green_box_1 room_4.

19. gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2.

20. gotoroom room_4 room_2 red_door_1.

21. gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_4.

Now in front of red_door_1, unlocked, and holding green_box_1. Then drop it:

22. gotoempty room_2.

23. drop green_box_1 room_2.

But this adds a lot of steps. However, the constraint is satisfied in step 18.

But the goal is to be in front of a red door that's unlocked. So after step 15, we are already there. Steps 16-23 are unnecessary for the goal, but required to satisfy constraint 10. But wait, constraint 10 requires that in at least one state, you are holding some object and green_box_1. So step 18 (picking green_box_1) satisfies that. So even if we do steps 16-18 after step 15, then the plan would be valid, but the final goal is achieved at step 15, and the rest are extra steps. However, the problem states that the plan must end with the goal achieved. So the final action should be the one that results in the goal.

But how to handle this. Maybe we need to rearrange the plan to include picking up green_box_1 before achieving the final goal.

Alternative idea: After unlocking red_door_1 (step 15), go back to room_4 to pick up green_box_1, then return to front of red_door_1.

But this would require:

15. toggle red_door_1 (now unlocked)

16. gotoroom room_2 room_4 red_door_1.

17. gotoobject green_box_1 room_4.

18. pick green_box_1 room_4.

19. gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2.

20. gotoroom room_4 room_2 red_door_1.

21. gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_4.

Now, in front of red_door_1, which is unlocked, and holding green_box_1. Then drop it:

22. gotoempty room_2.

23. drop green_box_1 room_2.

But the goal is already achieved at step 15. However, the constraints require that certain states are visited. So even if the plan ends at step 15, but we haven't picked up green_box_1, then constraint 10 is not met. Therefore, we must include steps to pick up green_box_1.

So, integrating this, the optimal plan must include picking up green_box_1. How to do that in the fewest steps.

Alternative approach: After unlocking red_door_1 and being in front of it (step 15), the goal is achieved. But we need to also have a state where we are holding green_box_1. So perhaps, before achieving the goal, we can pick up green_box_1 earlier in the plan.

But how? Let's think.

Suppose after moving to room_4 to room_3, we go back to room_4 to pick up green_box_1.

Original steps:

1. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3

2. toggle grey_door_1

3. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1

4. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_1

5. toggle blue_door_1

6. gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_1

7. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_1

8. pick purple_ball_1 room_1

9. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2

10. toggle yellow_door_1

11. gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1

12. gotoempty room_2

13. drop purple_ball_1 room_2

14. gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_4

15. toggle red_door_1

Now, after step 15, goal is achieved but constraint 10 is not. So, perhaps before step 15, we need to go back to room_4, pick up green_box_1, then return.

But that would require:

After step 13 (drop purple_ball_1 in room_2), we need to go to room_4.

But red_door_1 is locked. So we can't. So we need to unlock red_door_1 first. But unlocking it would require that purple_ball_1 is already in room_2, which it is. So after step 13:

14. gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_4

15. toggle red_door_1 (unlock)

16. gotoroom room_2 room_4 red_door_1

17. gotoobject green_box_1 room_4

18. pick green_box_1 room_4 (satisfy constraint 10)

19. gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2

20. gotoroom room_4 room_2 red_door_1

21. gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_4

Now, in front of red_door_1, which is unlocked. So the goal is achieved at step 21.

This adds steps 16-21. But is there a shorter way?

Alternatively, after step 15 (unlock red_door_1), we are in front of it. Then:

16. gotoroom room_2 room_4 red_door_1.

17. gotoobject green_box_1 room_4.

18. pick green_box_1 room_4.

19. gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2.

20. gotoroom room_4 room_2 red_door_1.

21. gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_4.

Now, in front of red_door_1, unlocked, and holding green_box_1. Drop it:

22. gotoempty room_2.

23. drop green_box_1 room_2.

But the goal is to be in front of the door, not holding anything. So after step 21, we are in front of the door, which is unlocked, but holding green_box_1. So the drop is necessary. But this adds steps. However, the constraint is satisfied in step 18.

But the plan must be optimal. So perhaps there's a way to pick up green_box_1 earlier without adding too many steps.

Wait, what if we pick up green_box_1 right at the beginning:

1. In room_4, gotoobject green_box_1.

2. pick green_box_1.

3. drop green_box_1.

Then proceed. This adds three steps but satisfies constraint 10 and 13 (since step 1 is in front of green_box_1).

Then, the rest of the plan as before. This would make the total steps longer, but maybe it's necessary.

But since the problem requires an optimal plan, we need to minimize the steps. Is there a way to combine picking up green_box_1 with other steps?

Alternatively, after step 15 (unlock red_door_1), we are in front of it. Then, we can immediately go to room_4, pick up green_box_1, and return. But this requires:

15. toggle red_door_1 (unlock)

16. gotoroom room_2 room_4 red_door_1

17. gotoobject green_box_1 room_4

18. pick green_box_1 room_4

19. gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2

20. gotoroom room_4 room_2 red_door_1

21. gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_4

Now, at step 21, we are in front of red_door_1, which is unlocked, and holding green_box_1. Then drop it:

22. gotoempty room_2

23. drop green_box_1 room_2

But this makes the plan 23 steps, which is longer than necessary. However, it's necessary to satisfy constraint 10.

Alternatively, perhaps during the initial steps, when in room_4, after unlocking grey_door_1 and before moving to room_3, pick up green_box_1.

So:

1. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3

2. toggle grey_door_1

3. gotoobject green_box_1 room_4

4. pick green_box_1 room_4

5. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1

Now, holding green_box_1 in room_3.

6. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_1

7. toggle blue_door_1

8. gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_1

9. gotoempty room_1

10. drop green_box_1 room_1

11. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_1

12. pick purple_ball_1 room_1

... proceed as before.

This adds steps but allows us to satisfy constraint 10 when we pick up green_box_1 in step 4.

But this increases the plan length. However, it's necessary to meet all constraints.

This is getting quite complicated. Let's try to outline the final plan, ensuring all constraints are met.

Final Plan Steps:

1. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3

2. toggle grey_door_1

3. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1

4. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_1

5. toggle blue_door_1

6. gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_1

7. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_1

8. pick purple_ball_1 room_1

9. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2

10. toggle yellow_door_1

11. gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1

12. gotoempty room_2

13. drop purple_ball_1 room_2

14. gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_4

15. toggle red_door_1

16. gotoroom room_2 room_4 red_door_1

17. gotoobject green_box_1 room_4

18. pick green_box_1 room_4

19. gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2

20. gotoroom room_4 room_2 red_door_1

21. gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_4

Now, after step 21, we are in front of red_door_1, which is unlocked. But we are holding green_box_1. The goal doesn't require us to not be holding anything, just to be in front of the door with it unlocked. So step 21 satisfies the goal. However, step 18 satisfies constraint 10. The problem requires that all constraints are met in at least one state, which they are.

But the plan is now 21 steps. However, the initial plan before considering constraint 10 was 15 steps. But we need to include the steps to pick up green_box_1.

But maybe there's a shorter path. Let's see:

Wait, after step 15, we are in front of red_door_1, which is unlocked. The goal is achieved. But constraint 10 requires holding green_box_1. So we need to have a step where we pick it up. However, if we can pick it up after achieving the goal, but the problem requires the plan to end with the goal achieved. So perhaps the final state is after step 15, and the other constraints must be met in earlier steps.

But no, the constraints must hold in at least one state, which can be before the final state. For example, constraint 10 requires that in some state, you are holding green_box_1. So even if you pick it up and then drop it before the final step, that's acceptable.

So, perhaps:

After step 15 (achieving the goal), we can go back to room_4, pick up green_box_1, and then drop it, but this adds steps. But the goal is already achieved, so the plan can end after step 15, and the constraints are met in earlier steps.

Wait, but constraint 10 requires that in at least one state, you are holding green_box_1 and some object. Which is only true when you are holding green_box_1. So if we never pick it up, it's not met. Therefore, we must include picking up green_box_1 in the plan.

So, the only way is to add steps to pick it up. This means that the initial plan was missing this, so we need to adjust.

Thus, the correct plan must include steps to pick up green_box_1.

But how to do this optimally.

Here's an optimal plan that includes picking up green_box_1 early:

1. gotoobject green_box_1 room_4

2. pick green_box_1 room_4 (satisfies constraints 8, 10, 13)

3. drop green_box_1 room_4

4. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3

5. toggle grey_door_1

6. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1

7. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_1

8. toggle blue_door_1

9. gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_1

10. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_1

11. pick purple_ball_1 room_1

12. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2

13. toggle yellow_door_1

14. gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1

15. gotoempty room_2

16. drop purple_ball_1 room_2

17. gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_4

18. toggle red_door_1

Now, this plan has 18 steps and satisfies all constraints.

Check constraint 10: step 2 (picking green_box_1) satisfies it.

Constraint 13: step 1 (front of green_box_1) and step 2 (holding it).

Other constraints:

- Being in front of red_door_1: step 17 and 18.

- Before step 17, being in front of blue_door_1: step 7.

- etc.

Yes, this should work. But is there a way to make it shorter?

Wait, after step 3 (drop green_box_1), we have to go to grey_door_1. But maybe instead of dropping it, we can carry it through the doors. But we need to pick up purple_ball_1 later, which requires dropping green_box_1 first.

So steps:

1. gotoobject green_box_1 room_4

2. pick green_box_1 room_4

3. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3

4. toggle grey_door_1

5. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1 (now in room_3, holding green_box_1)

6. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_1

7. toggle blue_door_1

8. gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_1 (now in room_1, holding green_box_1)

9. gotoempty room_1

10. drop green_box_1 room_1

11. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_1

12. pick purple_ball_1 room_1

... continue as before.

This adds steps 9 and 10, making the plan longer. So the initial approach of picking up and dropping green_box_1 early is better, resulting in 18 steps.

But maybe there's a more optimal path.

Alternative Idea: Use the initial steps to pick up green_box_1, then carry it to room_2 and drop it there when we go to drop purple_ball_1. But this may not save steps.

Alternatively, when in room_2 after dropping purple_ball_1, go back to room_4 via red_door_1 (now unlocked), pick up green_box_1, then return to room_2 to be in front of red_door_1.

But how many steps would that add?

After step 16 (drop purple_ball_1 in room_2):

17. gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_4

18. toggle red_door_1 (unlock)

19. gotoroom room_2 room_4 red_door_1

20. gotoobject green_box_1 room_4

21. pick green_box_1 room_4

22. gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2

23. gotoroom room_4 room_2 red_door_1

24. gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_4

Now, step 24: in front of red_door_1, unlocked, and holding green_box_1. Then drop it:

25. gotoempty room_2

26. drop green_box_1 room_2

So this adds 10 steps after dropping purple_ball_1, making the plan much longer.

Thus, the earlier approach of picking up green_box_1 in the beginning and dropping it immediately seems better, adding only 3 steps (steps 1-3), making the total steps 18.

But is there a way to integrate picking up green_box_1 without adding those steps?

Alternatively, after unlocking red_door_1 and being in front of it (step 18 in the 18-step plan), the goal is achieved. All constraints are met, including holding green_box_1 in step 2. So that plan is valid.

But the problem requires the plan to be optimal. So perhaps this is the minimal steps required.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a way to pick up green_box_1 after unlocking red_door_1 but without returning to room_4.

But how? If we are in room_2, after unlocking red_door_1, we can't access green_box_1 in room_4 unless we go there.

Thus, it seems the minimal plan would have to include those steps.

But let me recount the steps in the 18-step plan:

1. gotoobject green_box_1 room_4

2. pick green_box_1 room_4

3. drop green_box_1 room_4

4. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3

5. toggle grey_door_1

6. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1

7. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_1

8. toggle blue_door_1

9. gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_1

10. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_1

11. pick purple_ball_1 room_1

12. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2

13. toggle yellow_door_1

14. gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1

15. gotoempty room_2

16. drop purple_ball_1 room_2

17. gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_4

18. toggle red_door_1

After step 18, we are in front of red_door_1, which is unlocked. All constraints are met:

- Constraint 10 is met at step 2.

- The rest are covered as before.

This plan has 18 steps, but maybe there's a way to optimize further.

Wait, steps 1-3 can be omitted if we pick up green_box_1 after step 18. But then we have to add steps to do that, which might be longer.

Alternatively, can we use the action of picking up green_box_1 while already holding purple_ball_1? No, because you can't hold two objects.

Thus, the plan must include steps to pick up green_box_1 and then drop it before picking up purple_ball_1. Therefore, steps 1-3 are necessary.

But is there a way to avoid dropping green_box_1? For example, carry it to room_1, drop it there, then pick up purple_ball_1.

Let's see:

1. gotoobject green_box_1 room_4

2. pick green_box_1 room_4

3. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3

4. toggle grey_door_1

5. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1

6. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_1

7. toggle blue_door_1

8. gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_1

9. gotoempty room_1

10. drop green_box_1 room_1

11. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_1

12. pick purple_ball_1 room_1

... continue as before.

This results in 12 steps before picking up purple_ball_1, which adds more steps than the previous approach.

Thus, the initial 18-step plan seems to be the optimal one, given the constraints.
