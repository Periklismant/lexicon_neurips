Let me analyze this problem step by step.

First, let's understand the goal. We need to:
- Have a red door (which is red_door_1) unlocked
- Be in front of the red door
- The red door must be unlocked

Now, let's understand the constraints:
1. At some point, red_door_1 must be locked (initially it's locked, so that's already satisfied)
2. After red_door_1 is locked, at some point grey_door_1 must be unlocked
3. At some point, red_door_1 must be unlocked
4. Before red_door_1 is unlocked, purple_ball_1 must be in room_2 (initially it's in room_1)
5. At some point, we must be in front of red_door_1
6. Before being in front of red_door_1, we must first be in front of blue_door_1
7. At some point, yellow_door_1 must be unlocked (initially it's locked)
8. At some point, we must be holding some object
9. At some point, we must either be in front of grey_ball_1 or holding purple_ball_1
10. At some point, we must be holding green_box_1
11. At some point, either grey_door_1 is unlocked or we are in front of purple_box_1
12. At some point, we must either be holding purple_ball_1 or holding some object (redundant with 8)
13. At some point, we must either be holding red_ball_2 or be in front of green_box_1

Now let's think about the initial state:
- We are in room_4
- There are three balls in room_1
- There's one box and one ball in room_2
- There are two boxes and one ball in room_4 (the room we're in)
- All doors are locked

Let's plan the steps needed to satisfy all constraints and reach the goal:

1. We need purple_ball_1 to be in room_2 before unlocking red_door_1, and purple_ball_1 starts in room_1. We also need to unlock doors to move between rooms.

2. To get to room_1 from room_4, we can either go through room_3 or room_2. Let's go through room_2 since there's a constraint about unlocking yellow_door_1 which connects room_1 and room_2.

3. First, let's unlock the red_door_1 that connects room_4 and room_2:
   - Go in front of red_door_1 in room_4
   - Toggle red_door_1 to unlock it
   - Go to room_2 through red_door_1

4. Now, let's go to yellow_door_1 which connects room_2 and room_1:
   - Go in front of yellow_door_1 in room_2
   - Toggle yellow_door_1 to unlock it
   - Go to room_1 through yellow_door_1

5. Now in room_1, let's pick up purple_ball_1:
   - Go in front of purple_ball_1 in room_1
   - Pick up purple_ball_1
   
6. Let's also go in front of grey_ball_1 to satisfy constraint 9:
   - Go in front of grey_ball_1 in room_1

7. Now let's go back to room_2 to place purple_ball_1 there (to satisfy constraint 4):
   - Go to yellow_door_1
   - Go to room_2 through yellow_door_1
   - Go to an empty position in room_2
   - Drop purple_ball_1 in room_2

8. Now, let's go to blue_door_1 which connects room_1 and room_3 (to satisfy constraint 6):
   - Go back to room_1 through yellow_door_1
   - Go in front of blue_door_1 in room_1
   - Toggle blue_door_1 to unlock it

9. Now let's go in front of purple_box_1 in room_2 to satisfy constraint 11:
   - Go back to room_2 through yellow_door_1
   - Go in front of purple_box_1 in room_2

10. Now, let's go back to room_4 to pick up green_box_1 (to satisfy constraint 10):
   - Go in front of red_door_1 in room_2
   - Go to room_4 through red_door_1
   - Go in front of green_box_1 in room_4
   - Pick up green_box_1 (satisfies constraint 10 and part of 13)

11. Now, let's unlock grey_door_1 to satisfy constraint 2:
   - Go in front of grey_door_1 in room_4
   - Toggle grey_door_1 to unlock it

12. Finally, let's go back to red_door_1 to satisfy the main goal:
   - Drop green_box_1 (we need empty hands to toggle the door)
   - Go in front of red_door_1 in room_4
   - Toggle red_door_1 to lock it (red_door_1 was unlocked, now it's locked again)
   - Toggle red_door_1 to unlock it (satisfies the goal)

Let's double-check that all constraints are satisfied:

1. "red_door_1 is locked" - Initially satisfied and also after we lock it in step 12
2. "After red_door_1 is locked, grey_door_1 must be unlocked" - We unlock grey_door_1 in step 11
3. "red_door_1 is not locked" - Satisfied when we first unlock it in step 3 and again in step 12
4. "Before red_door_1 is unlocked, purple_ball_1 must be in room_2" - We put purple_ball_1 in room_2 in step 7 before unlocking red_door_1 in step 12
5. "you are in front of red_door_1" - Satisfied in steps 3 and 12
6. "Before being in front of red_door_1, you must be in front of blue_door_1" - We go in front of blue_door_1 in step 8
7. "yellow_door_1 is not locked" - Satisfied in step 4
8. "you are holding some object" - Satisfied when holding purple_ball_1 in steps 5-7 and green_box_1 in step 10
9. "Either in front of grey_ball_1 or holding purple_ball_1" - Satisfied by both being in front of grey_ball_1 in step 6 and holding purple_ball_1 in steps 5-7
10. "you are holding green_box_1" - Satisfied in step 10
11. "Either grey_door_1 is unlocked or you are in front of purple_box_1" - Satisfied by both unlocking grey_door_1 in step 11 and going in front of purple_box_1 in step 9
12. "Either holding purple_ball_1 or holding some object" - Satisfied in steps 5-7 and 10
13. "Either holding red_ball_2 or in front of green_box_1" - Satisfied in step 10 by being in front of green_box_1

Oh wait, I notice some issues with this plan. Let me review and revise:

1. I need to actually go in front of the doors before toggling them, and I need to make sure I'm in the right room to see each door.
2. I wasn't careful about ensuring I'm in front of blue_door_1 before being in front of red_door_1.

Let me revise the plan:

Starting from room_4:

1. Unlock grey_door_1 to satisfy constraint 2:
   - gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3
   - toggle grey_door_1

2. Unlock red_door_1 to satisfy constraint 3:
   - gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2
   - toggle red_door_1
   - gotoroom room_4 room_2 red_door_1

3. Go to yellow_door_1 and unlock it to satisfy constraint 7:
   - gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_1
   - toggle yellow_door_1
   - gotoroom room_2 room_1 yellow_door_1

4. Go to blue_door_1 to satisfy constraint 6:
   - gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_3
   - toggle blue_door_1

5. Pick up purple_ball_1 to satisfy constraint 12:
   - gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_1
   - pick purple_ball_1 room_1
   (This also helps satisfy constraint 9)

6. Go to grey_ball_1 to ensure constraint 9 is satisfied:
   - gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_1

7. Take purple_ball_1 to room_2 to satisfy constraint 4:
   - gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2
   - gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1
   - gotoempty
   - drop purple_ball_1 room_2

8. Go to purple_box_1 to satisfy constraint 11:
   - gotoobject purple_box_1 room_2

9. Go back to room_4 to pick up green_box_1:
   - gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_4
   - gotoroom room_2 room_4 red_door_1
   - gotoobject green_box_1 room_4
   - pick green_box_1 room_4
   (This satisfies constraint 10 and part of 13)

10. Finally, go to red_door_1 to complete the goal:
    - gotoempty
    - drop green_box_1 room_4
    - gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2
    - toggle red_door_1 (locks it, satisfying constraint 1)
    - toggle red_door_1 (unlocks it, satisfying the goal)

The goal state is: "There is a door d such that "The following conditions are all true: "d is red", "you are in front of d", "d is not locked"""

After the last toggle, we have:
- d is red_door_1 which is red
- We are in front of red_door_1
- red_door_1 is not locked

Let's double-check that all constraints are satisfied:

1. "red_door_1 is locked" - Initially satisfied and also after we lock it in step 10
2. "After red_door_1 is locked, grey_door_1 must be unlocked" - We unlock grey_door_1 in step 1
3. "red_door_1 is not locked" - Satisfied when we unlock it in step 2 and again in step 10
4. "Before red_door_1 is unlocked, purple_ball_1 must be in room_2" - We put purple_ball_1 in room_2 in step 7
5. "you are in front of red_door_1" - Satisfied in steps 2 and 10
6. "Before being in front of red_door_1, you must be in front of blue_door_1" - We go in front of blue_door_1 in step 4
7. "yellow_door_1 is not locked" - Satisfied in step 3
8. "you are holding some object" - Satisfied when holding purple_ball_1 in steps 5-7 and green_box_1 in step 9
9. "Either in front of grey_ball_1 or holding purple_ball_1" - Satisfied by both being in front of grey_ball_1 in step 6 and holding purple_ball_1 in steps 5-7
10. "you are holding green_box_1" - Satisfied in step 9
11. "Either grey_door_1 is unlocked or you are in front of purple_box_1" - Satisfied by both unlocking grey_door_1 in step 1 and going in front of purple_box_1 in step 8
12. "Either holding purple_ball_1 or holding some object" - Satisfied in steps 5-7 and 9
13. "Either holding red_ball_2 or in front of green_box_1" - Satisfied in step 9 by being in front of green_box_1

I think this plan should work, but I'm a bit concerned about the sequence of constraints 4, 6, and the main goal. Let me revise the plan again to make sure we satisfy them all:

Starting from room_4:

1. Unlock grey_door_1 to satisfy constraint 2:
   - gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3
   - toggle grey_door_1

2. Go to room_2 through red_door_1:
   - gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2
   - toggle red_door_1
   - gotoroom room_4 room_2 red_door_1

3. Go to room_1 through yellow_door_1:
   - gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_1
   - toggle yellow_door_1
   - gotoroom room_2 room_1 yellow_door_1

4. Go to blue_door_1 to satisfy constraint 6:
   - gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_3
   - toggle blue_door_1

5. Pick up purple_ball_1 to satisfy constraint 12:
   - gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_1
   - pick purple_ball_1 room_1
   (This also helps satisfy constraint 9)

6. Go to grey_ball_1 to ensure constraint 9 is satisfied:
   - gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_1

7. Take purple_ball_1 to room_2 to satisfy constraint 4:
   - gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2
   - gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1
   - gotoempty
   - drop purple_ball_1 room_2

8. Go to purple_box_1 to satisfy constraint 11:
   - gotoobject purple_box_1 room_2

9. Go back to room_4 to pick up green_box_1:
   - gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_4
   - gotoroom room_2 room_4 red_door_1
   - gotoobject green_box_1 room_4
   - pick green_box_1 room_4
   (This satisfies constraint 10 and part of 13)

10. Finally, go to red_door_1 to complete the goal:
    - gotoempty
    - drop green_box_1 room_4
    - gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2
    - toggle red_door_1 (locks it, satisfying constraint 1)
    - toggle red_door_1 (unlocks it, satisfying the goal)

The above plan seems to satisfy all constraints. Let me condense this into the list of actions in the required format:

```
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3
toggle grey_door_1
gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2
toggle red_door_1
gotoroom room_4 room_2 red_door_1
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_1
toggle yellow_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_1 yellow_door_1
gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_3
toggle blue_door_1
gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_1
pick purple_ball_1 room_1
gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_1
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2
gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1
gotoempty
drop purple_ball_1 room_2
gotoobject purple_box_1 room_2
gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_4
gotoroom room_2 room_4 red_door_1
gotoobject green_box_1 room_4
pick green_box_1 room_4
gotoempty
drop green_box_1 room_4
gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2
toggle red_door_1
toggle red_door_1
```

Actually, let's think through this plan one more time to make sure the constraints are satisfied in the right order:

Starting in room_4.

1. First, we need to make sure we satisfy constraint 4: before red_door_1 is unlocked, purple_ball_1 must be in room_2. 
   - purple_ball_1 starts in room_1, so we need to move it to room_2.
   - To get to room_1, we need to unlock some doors.

2. Let's unlock grey_door_1 first to satisfy constraint 2:
   - gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3
   - toggle grey_door_1

3. Next, let's unlock red_door_1 to get to room_2:
   - gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2
   - toggle red_door_1
   - gotoroom room_4 room_2 red_door_1

4. Now from room_2, let's unlock yellow_door_1 to get to room_1:
   - gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_1
   - toggle yellow_door_1
   - gotoroom room_2 room_1 yellow_door_1

5. In room_1, we need to go in front of blue_door_1 before we can be in front of red_door_1 (constraint 6):
   - gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_3
   - toggle blue_door_1

6. Now let's pick up purple_ball_1:
   - gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_1
   - pick purple_ball_1 room_1
   (This satisfies constraint 8, 9, and 12)

7. Let's also go in front of grey_ball_1 to ensure constraint 9 is satisfied:
   - gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_1

8. Now we take purple_ball_1 to room_2:
   - gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2
   - gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1
   - gotoempty
   - drop purple_ball_1 room_2
   (This satisfies constraint 4)

9. Go to purple_box_1 to satisfy constraint 11:
   - gotoobject purple_box_1 room_2

10. Now let's go back to room_4 to pick up green_box_1:
    - gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_4
    - gotoroom room_2 room_4 red_door_1
    - gotoobject green_box_1 room_4
    - pick green_box_1 room_4
    (This satisfies constraint 10 and part of 13)

11. Finally, let's go to red_door_1 to toggle it again, completing the goal:
    - gotoempty
    - drop green_box_1 room_4
    - gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2
    - toggle red_door_1 (to lock it, satisfying constraint 1)
    - toggle red_door_1 (to unlock it again, satisfying the goal)

Wait, let me check if the constraints are properly satisfied:

1. "red_door_1 is locked" - Satisfied initially and after we lock it in step 11
2. "After red_door_1 is locked, grey_door_1 must be unlocked" - We unlock grey_door_1 in step 2.
3. "red_door_1 is not locked" - Satisfied when we unlock it in step 3 and again in step 11
4. "Before red_door_1 is unlocked, purple_ball_1 must be in room_2" - We put purple_ball_1 in room_2 in step 8, but we already unlocked red_door_1 in step 3.

There's a problem with constraint 4. We need to ensure that purple_ball_1 is in room_2 before we unlock red_door_1, but in our plan, we unlock red_door_1 in step 3 before we move purple_ball_1 to room_2 in step 8.

Let's revise the plan. Since red_door_1 is initially locked and purple_ball_1 is in room_1, we need to get purple_ball_1 to room_2 first before unlocking red_door_1. 

New plan:

Starting in room_4.

1. Unlock grey_door_1:
   - gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3
   - toggle grey_door_1
   - gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1

2. Unlock blue_door_1:
   - gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_1
   - toggle blue_door_1
   - gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_1

3. Pick up purple_ball_1:
   - gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_1
   - pick purple_ball_1 room_1
   (Satisfies constraint 8, 9, and 12)

4. Go in front of grey_ball_1:
   - gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_1
   (Ensures constraint 9 is satisfied)

5. Unlock yellow_door_1:
   - gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2
   - toggle yellow_door_1
   - gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1

6. Drop purple_ball_1 in room_2:
   - gotoempty
   - drop purple_ball_1 room_2
   (Now purple_ball_1 is in room_2, satisfying part of constraint 4)

7. Go to purple_box_1:
   - gotoobject purple_box_1 room_2
   (Satisfies constraint 11)

8. Unlock red_door_1:
   - gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_4
   - toggle red_door_1
   - gotoroom room_2 room_4 red_door_1
   (Now red_door_1 is unlocked and purple_ball_1 is in room_2, satisfying constraint 4)

9. Pick up green_box_1:
   - gotoobject green_box_1 room_4
   - pick green_box_1 room_4
   (Satisfies constraint 10 and part of 13)

10. Complete the goal:
    - gotoempty
    - drop green_box_1 room_4
    - gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2
    - toggle red_door_1 (to lock it, satisfying constraint 1)
    - toggle red_door_1 (to unlock it again, satisfying the goal)

Now let me check if the constraints are properly satisfied:

1. "red_door_1 is locked" - Satisfied initially and after we lock it in step 10
2. "After red_door_1 is locked, grey_door_1 must be unlocked" - We unlock grey_door_1 in step 1
3. "red_door_1 is not locked" - Satisfied when we unlock it in step 8 and again in step 10
4. "Before red_door_1 is unlocked, purple_ball_1 must be in room_2" - We put purple_ball_1 in room_2 in step 6 before unlocking red_door_1 in step 8
5. "you are in front of red_door_1" - Satisfied in steps 8 and 10
6. "Before being in front of red_door_1, you must be in front of blue_door_1" - We go in front of blue_door_1 in step 2
7. "yellow_door_1 is not locked" - Satisfied after step 5
8. "you are holding some object" - Satisfied when holding purple_ball_1 in steps 3-6 and green_box_1 in step 9
9. "Either in front of grey_ball_1 or holding purple_ball_1" - Satisfied by both being in front of grey_ball_1 in step 4 and holding purple_ball_1 in steps 3-6
10. "you are holding green_box_1" - Satisfied in step 9
11. "Either grey_door_1 is unlocked or you are in front of purple_box_1" - Satisfied by both unlocking grey_door_1 in step 1 and going in front of purple_box_1 in step 7
12. "Either holding purple_ball_1 or holding some object" - Satisfied in steps 3-6 and 9
13. "Either holding red_ball_2 or in front of green_box_1" - Satisfied in step 9 by being in front of green_box_1

I believe this updated plan satisfies all constraints. Let me condense this into the list of actions in the required format:

```
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3
toggle grey_door_1
gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1
gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_1
toggle blue_door_1
gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_1
gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_1
pick purple_ball_1 room_1
gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_1
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2
toggle yellow_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1
gotoempty
drop purple_ball_1 room_2
gotoobject purple_box_1 room_2
gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_4
toggle red_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_4 red_door_1
gotoobject green_box_1 room_4
pick green_box_1 room_4
gotoempty
drop green_box_1 room_4
gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2
toggle red_door_1
toggle red_door_1
```

Let me trace through the execution one more time to make sure this works and to see if we can optimize it.

1. Unlock grey_door_1:
   - gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3
   - toggle grey_door_1
   - gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1

2. Unlock blue_door_1:
   - gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_1
   - toggle blue_door_1
   - gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_1

3. Pick up purple_ball_1:
   - gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_1
   - pick purple_ball_1 room_1

4. Go in front of grey_ball_1:
   - gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_1

5. Unlock yellow_door_1:
   - gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2
   - toggle yellow_door_1
   - gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1

6. Drop purple_ball_1 in room_2:
   - gotoempty
   - drop purple_ball_1 room_2

7. Go to purple_box_1:
   - gotoobject purple_box_1 room_2

8. Unlock red_door_1:
   - gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_4
   - toggle red_door_1
   - gotoroom room_2 room_4 red_door_1

9. Pick up green_box_1:
   - gotoobject green_box_1 room_4
   - pick green_box_1 room_4

10. Complete the goal:
    - gotoempty
    - drop green_box_1 room_4
    - gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2
    - toggle red_door_1 (to lock it)
    - toggle red_door_1 (to unlock it again)

This plan satisfies all the constraints in the right order. Let me check if I can optimize it by removing unnecessary steps.

I believe we need every step in the plan to satisfy the constraints, so I don't see any obvious optimizations.

Let's finalize the plan:

```
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3
toggle grey_door_1
gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1
gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_1
toggle blue_door_1
gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_1
gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_1
pick purple_ball_1 room_1
gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_1
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2
toggle yellow_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1
gotoempty
drop purple_ball_1 room_2
gotoobject purple_box_1 room_2
gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_4
toggle red_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_4 red_door_1
gotoobject green_box_1 room_4
pick green_box_1 room_4
gotoempty
drop green_box_1 room_4
gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2
toggle red_door_1

```
