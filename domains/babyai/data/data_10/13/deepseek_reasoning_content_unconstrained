Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. The goal is to find a sequence of actions that gets me in front of a red door that's unlocked. Let me start by understanding the initial state and the constraints.

First, the initial state: I'm in room_4. All doors are locked. The doors are yellow, blue, red, and grey. The red door connects room_2 and room_4. The grey door connects room_3 and room_4. So, to get to a red door, which is red_door_1, I need to go from room_4 to room_2 via red_door_1, but it's locked. Similarly, the other doors are also locked.

The goal is to be in front of a red door that's unlocked. So I need to unlock the red door first. To unlock it, I have to toggle it, which requires being in front of it. But to get in front of it, I need to go to the door, which might be blocked if there's an object in front of it. Wait, the preconditions for "gotodoor" say that there's no object blocking the position in front of the door in the current room.

Looking at the objects in each room: In room_4, there's green_box_1, blue_box_1, and red_ball_2. So, are any of these blocking the doors? The doors in room_4 are red_door_1 (connecting to room_2) and grey_door_1 (connecting to room_3). So, if any objects are in front of these doors in room_4, then I can't go to the door until they're moved. But how do objects block doors? The problem mentions that picking up an object that's blocking a door unblocks it. So maybe the presence of an object in front of the door is considered blocking.

Wait, the effect of picking up an object x includes: (v) if x was blocking some door, then it's no longer blocking that door. So perhaps objects can block doors. But the initial state doesn't mention any objects blocking doors. So maybe initially, no doors are blocked by objects. Therefore, I can go to the doors in room_4 (red_door_1 and grey_door_1) as long as there's no object in front of them. But the initial state doesn't state that any objects are blocking doors. So maybe the doors are not blocked. So I can go to red_door_1 from room_4.

Wait, but the red_door_1 is in room_4 connected to room_2. So to go to red_door_1 from room_4, I can do "gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2". Then, toggle it to unlock. But since the door is locked, I can't go through it yet, but I can unlock it by toggling. Once unlocked, I can be in front of it, and since the goal requires it to be unlocked, that's the state we need.

But the problem is that all doors start locked. So I need to unlock the red door. Let's think step by step.

Current location: room_4. The red door (red_door_1) connects room_4 and room_2. So in room_4, I can go to the red door. Let's check if there's any object blocking it. In room_4, the objects are green_box_1, blue_box_1, red_ball_2. But unless they are in front of the door, they don't block. The problem doesn't specify where exactly the objects are placed relative to the doors. Since the initial state doesn't mention any blocking, I assume that the doors are not blocked. So I can go to red_door_1.

So steps:

1. Go to red_door_1 in room_4. Action: gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2. Then, toggle it to unlock. Then, since after toggling, the door becomes unlocked. Now, the goal is to be in front of a red door that's not locked. But after toggling, the door is unlocked. Wait, the toggle action toggles the state. Since the door is initially locked, toggling it once will unlock it. So the steps would be:

- gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2 (from room_4, which is current)
- toggle red_door_1

But wait, the preconditions for "toggle d" require being in front of d. So I need to be in front of the door before toggling. So first, go to the door, then toggle.

So the plan would be:

1. gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2
2. toggle red_door_1

After that, the red_door_1 is unlocked, and I'm in front of it. That satisfies the goal: there's a door (red_door_1) that is red, I'm in front of it, and it's not locked. So this should work.

But wait, let's check if red_door_1 is red. The initial state says red_door_1 is red. So yes.

So the plan would be:

goto door red_door_1 room_4 room_2
toggle red_door_1

But wait, the action "gotodoor" requires that I'm in a room connected by the door. Since I'm in room_4, which is connected to room_2 via red_door_1, that's correct. So the first action is valid.

Then, toggle the door. Since I'm in front of it, the toggle is allowed, and it unlocks the door. Then the goal is achieved.

But wait, the initial state says that red_door_1 is locked. So after toggling once, it's unlocked. So that's correct.

So the plan is two actions. But maybe there's a shorter path? Let's see. Are there any constraints that I'm missing?

The problem's constraints: Are there any constraints provided? The user mentions "the following constraints" but then there's nothing. Wait, looking back:

"A valid plan for the abovementioned problem must abide by the following constraints:"

But after that, there's no text. Maybe that's a formatting error. Wait, looking at the original input, maybe the user forgot to include constraints. But in the problem as presented, perhaps there are no additional constraints beyond the standard action preconditions. So the constraints mentioned are the ones inherent in the problem (actions' preconditions and effects).

So the plan would be those two actions. But let's check if there's any blocking.

Wait, when I perform "gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2", the precondition is that I'm in a room connected by the door (room_4 is connected via red_door_1 to room_2, so that's okay) and that there's no object blocking the position in front of d in the current room (room_4). Are there any objects blocking that position?

The initial state in room_4 has green_box_1, blue_box_1, red_ball_2. But the problem doesn't state that they are in front of the door. So unless specified, we can assume that the position in front of the door is empty. Therefore, the gotodoor action is allowed.

Therefore, the two actions should suffice. Let me confirm:

After gotodoor, I'm in front of red_door_1. Then toggle it, which unlocks it. Now, the door is unlocked, I'm in front of it, and it's red. So the goal is achieved. This seems correct.

But let's check if the agent needs to be in the same room as the door. Since the door connects two rooms, but when you're in front of the door, you're still in the same room. So after gotodoor, I'm in room_4, in front of red_door_1. Then toggle it, which unlocks. The goal requires being in front of a red door that's not locked. So yes.

So the optimal plan is two actions. That's the shortest possible, as any other plan would involve more steps. For example, if the door was blocked, you'd need to move objects, but here it's not the case.
