Let's analyze this planning problem:

**Initial state:**
- I am in room_4.
- red_ball_1 and red_ball_2 are in room_1.
- green_box_1 is in room_1.
- green_box_2 and yellow_box_1 are in room_2.
- blue_box_1 and grey_ball_1 are in room_3.
- purple_ball_1 is in room_4.
- All doors are locked.
- I'm not holding any object.
- Rooms are connected as follows:
  - room_1 and room_2 via green_door_1
  - room_1 and room_3 via yellow_door_1
  - room_2 and room_4 via yellow_door_2
  - room_3 and room_4 via purple_door_1
- I have visited room_4.

**Goal:**
- I need to be in room_1.
- There must be a green box in room_1.
- I need to be in front of this green box.

Looking at the initial state, I see that green_box_1 is already in room_1. So, my goal is to:
1. Navigate to room_1.
2. Go in front of green_box_1.

To navigate to room_1 from room_4, I have a few potential paths:
- room_4 -> room_2 -> room_1
- room_4 -> room_3 -> room_1

Let's plan for the first path:

1. Go to the yellow_door_2 that connects room_4 and room_2.
2. Unlock (toggle) yellow_door_2.
3. Go to room_2.
4. Go to the green_door_1 that connects room_2 and room_1.
5. Unlock (toggle) green_door_1.
6. Go to room_1.
7. Go in front of green_box_1.

Let's execute this plan step by step:

```
gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_2
toggle yellow_door_2
gotoroom room_4 room_2 yellow_door_2
gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_1
toggle green_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_1 green_door_1
gotoobject green_box_1 room_1
```

Let's double-check this plan to ensure I'm meeting all the preconditions and effects:

1. `gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_2`:
   - Precondition: I'm in room_4, and yellow_door_2 connects room_4 with room_2.
   - Effect: I'm in front of yellow_door_2.

2. `toggle yellow_door_2`:
   - Precondition: I'm in front of yellow_door_2.
   - Effect: yellow_door_2 becomes unlocked.

3. `gotoroom room_4 room_2 yellow_door_2`:
   - Precondition: I'm in room_4, room_2 is adjacent via yellow_door_2, and yellow_door_2 is unlocked.
   - Effect: I'm in room_2, and I've visited room_2.

4. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_1`:
   - Precondition: I'm in room_2, and green_door_1 connects room_2 with room_1.
   - Effect: I'm in front of green_door_1.

5. `toggle green_door_1`:
   - Precondition: I'm in front of green_door_1.
   - Effect: green_door_1 becomes unlocked.

6. `gotoroom room_2 room_1 green_door_1`:
   - Precondition: I'm in room_2, room_1 is adjacent via green_door_1, and green_door_1 is unlocked.
   - Effect: I'm in room_1, and I've visited room_1.

7. `gotoobject green_box_1 room_1`:
   - Precondition: I'm in room_1, and green_box_1 is in room_1.
   - Effect: I'm in front of green_box_1.

After executing this plan, I should be in room_1, in front of green_box_1, which satisfies all the goal conditions.

Actually, let me reconsider the plan. The question says I should provide an optimal plan (minimal number of actions), and there might be more efficient ways to reach room_1 from room_4. Let's consider both paths again:

Path 1: room_4 -> room_2 -> room_1
Steps:
1. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_2
2. toggle yellow_door_2
3. gotoroom room_4 room_2 yellow_door_2
4. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_1
5. toggle green_door_1
6. gotoroom room_2 room_1 green_door_1
7. gotoobject green_box_1 room_1

Path 2: room_4 -> room_3 -> room_1
Steps:
1. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_3
2. toggle purple_door_1
3. gotoroom room_4 room_3 purple_door_1
4. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1
5. toggle yellow_door_1
6. gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_1
7. gotoobject green_box_1 room_1

Both paths have the same number of steps, so they are equally optimal. I'll provide the first one as the solution:

```
gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_2
toggle yellow_door_2
gotoroom room_4 room_2 yellow_door_2
gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_1
toggle green_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_1 green_door_1
gotoobject green_box_1 room_1
```

Wait, looking at the goal again, I need to ensure that "There is a box v such that v is green, v is in room_1, you are in room_1, and you are in front of v." From the initial state, green_box_1 is already in room_1. So I don't need to move any boxes; I just need to navigate to room_1 and be in front of green_box_1.

Actually, let's double check if the actions are in the right format. The action descriptions are:

- "gotoobject x r": Go in front of to object x in room r.
- "gotoempty": Go in front of an empty position of the room, which does not contain any object.
- "gotodoor d r1 r2": Go in front of door d, connecting room r1 to room r2.
- "gotoroom r1 r2 d": Go to room r2 from room r1 using door d.
- "pick x r": Pick up object x in room r.
- "drop x r": Drop object x in room r.
- "toggle d": Unlock door d if is locked. Lock door d if is unlocked.

My plan seems to match the correct format for each action. Let's submit the plan:

```
gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_2
toggle yellow_door_2
gotoroom room_4 room_2 yellow_door_2
gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_1
toggle green_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_1 green_door_1
gotoobject green_box_1 room_1
```

Hmm, let's take one more careful look at everything just for safety.

The objective is to be in room_1, in front of a green box (that is, satisfying the condition "There is a box v such that "The following conditions are all true: "v is green", "v is in room_1", "you are in room_1", "you are in front of v"""

The initial state says that green_box_1 is in room_1. So I don't need to move any green box to room_1. I just need to get to room_1 and then go in front of green_box_1.

My plan is:
1. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_2
2. toggle yellow_door_2
3. gotoroom room_4 room_2 yellow_door_2
4. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_1
5. toggle green_door_1
6. gotoroom room_2 room_1 green_door_1
7. gotoobject green_box_1 room_1

This seems correct, and the most efficient path from room_4 to room_1.

Actually, let me double check that the orders of the arguments for the actions match the proper format.

For "gotodoor", it's "gotodoor d r1 r2": Go in front of door d, connecting room r1 to room r2.
- Step 1: gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_2
- Step 4: gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_1

These match the format.

For "gotoroom", it's "gotoroom r1 r2 d": Go to room r2 from room r1 using door d.
- Step 3: gotoroom room_4 room_2 yellow_door_2
- Step 6: gotoroom room_2 room_1 green_door_1

These also match the format.

For "gotoobject", it's "gotoobject x r": Go in front of to object x in room r.
- Step 7: gotoobject green_box_1 room_1

This matches the format too.

For "toggle", it's "toggle d": Unlock door d if is locked. Lock door d if is unlocked.
- Step 2: toggle yellow_door_2
- Step 5: toggle green_door_1

These match the format as well.

So the plan is:
```
gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_2
toggle yellow_door_2
gotoroom room_4 room_2 yellow_door_2
gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_1
toggle green_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_1 green_door_1
gotoobject green_box_1 room_1
```
Actually, I forgot to consider another valid path for reaching the goal: room_4 -> room_3 -> room_1.

Let's compare both paths again:

Path 1: room_4 -> room_2 -> room_1
Steps:
1. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_2
2. toggle yellow_door_2
3. gotoroom room_4 room_2 yellow_door_2
4. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_1
5. toggle green_door_1
6. gotoroom room_2 room_1 green_door_1
7. gotoobject green_box_1 room_1

Path 2: room_4 -> room_3 -> room_1
Steps:
1. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_3
2. toggle purple_door_1
3. gotoroom room_4 room_3 purple_door_1
4. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1
5. toggle yellow_door_1
6. gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_1
7. gotoobject green_box_1 room_1

Both paths require the same number of steps (7). Since they are equally optimal, I'll go with the first one as my final answer.

Actually, wait, there's another thing I should confirm. The goal says I need to be in front of a green box in room_1, and green_box_1 is initially in room_1. But I need to check if there's any other green box. From the initial state, I see that green_box_2 is in room_2. So I have two options:

1. Go to room_1 and be in front of green_box_1 (which is already in room_1).
2. Transport green_box_2 from room_2 to room_1, and then be in front of it.

Let's analyze the second option:
1. Navigate to room_2.
2. Go in front of green_box_2.
3. Pick up green_box_2.
4. Navigate to room_1.
5. Drop green_box_2.

This is more steps than simply going to room_1 and standing in front of green_box_1, which is already there. So the first option is more optimal, which is the plan I've provided.

Alright, so my optimal plan is:
```
gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_2
toggle yellow_door_2
gotoroom room_4 room_2 yellow_door_2
gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_1
toggle green_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_1 green_door_1
gotoobject green_box_1 room_1
```

Actually, I need to reconsider. I'm trying to find the optimal plan, which means I need to choose the path with the fewest steps.

Both paths from room_4 to room_1 have the same number of steps, so they are equally optimal. But I should double-check if I'm using the correct format for the action primitives.

Let's recall that:
- "gotodoor d r1 r2": Go in front of door d, connecting room r1 to room r2.
- "gotoroom r1 r2 d": Go to room r2 from room r1 using door d.

So, for the "gotodoor" action, I need to specify the door first, then the two rooms it connects. And for the "gotoroom" action, I need to specify the starting room, the destination room, and then the door.

With that in mind, my plan (for the path room_4 -> room_2 -> room_1) is:
```
gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_2
toggle yellow_door_2
gotoroom room_4 room_2 yellow_door_2
gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_1
toggle green_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_1 green_door_1
gotoobject green_box_1 room_1
```

And for the alternative path (room_4 -> room_3 -> room_1):
```
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_3
toggle purple_door_1
gotoroom room_4 room_3 purple_door_1
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1
toggle yellow_door_1
gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_1
gotoobject green_box_1 room_1
```

Both of these plans are correct and have the same number of steps. Since I've been working with the first one throughout, I'll stick with it as my final answer.

Actually, a subtle issue that might arise is the order of the room arguments in "gotodoor", so let's be extra careful. The initial state says:
- "room_2 and room_1 are connected via green_door_1"
- "room_1 and room_2 are connected via green_door_1"
- "room_3 and room_1 are connected via yellow_door_1"
- "room_1 and room_3 are connected via yellow_door_1"
- "room_4 and room_2 are connected via yellow_door_2"
- "room_2 and room_4 are connected via yellow_door_2"
- "room_4 and room_3 are connected via purple_door_1"
- "room_3 and room_4 are connected via purple_door_1"

This means the door is symmetrically connecting both rooms. So when I'm in room_4, I can refer to the door as connecting room_4 and room_2 or room_2 and room_4. The same applies to the other doors.

With that in mind, I think my plan is correct. Let's go with the path from room_4 to room_2 to room_1:
```
gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_2
toggle yellow_door_2
gotoroom room_4 room_2 yellow_door_2
gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_1
toggle green_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_1 green_door_1
gotoobject green_box_1 room_1
```

One last thing: did I miss any edge cases? Let's check:

- Is green_box_1 accessible in room_1? There's no indication that it's blocked or not accessible, so I assume I can go in front of it once I'm in room_1.
- Are there any constraints on the plan? The problem statement just says "A valid plan for the abovementioned problem must abide by the following constraints:", but doesn't list any specific constraints. Hmm, maybe a typo? I'll assume there are no additional constraints to the problem.

Alright, I think the plan I provided is correct. Let's  (finally) actually finish:

```
gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_2
toggle yellow_door_2
gotoroom room_4 room_2 yellow_door_2
gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_1
toggle green_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_1 green_door_1
gotoobject green_box_1 room_1
```
