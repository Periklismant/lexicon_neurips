Okay, let's see. The goal is to have a green box in room_1, with me in room_1 in front of it. The initial state has me in room_4. So I need to get to room_1 and be in front of a green box there. Let's check the initial objects. Green boxes are green_box_1 and green_box_2. Green_box_1 is already in room_1. So maybe that's the one. But wait, the initial state says green_box_1 is in room_1. So if that's already there, why do I need to do anything? Wait, the goal is that there exists a box v that is green, in room_1, and I'm in room_1 in front of it. So if green_box_1 is already in room_1, maybe I just need to go there and position myself in front of it. But how to get there from room_4?

But the doors are all locked. The doors are green_door_1, yellow_door_1, yellow_door_2, purple_door_1. All are locked. So I need to unlock doors to move between rooms. Let's look at the connections. The rooms are connected as per the doors: room_1 connects to room_2 via green_door_1, room_1 to room_3 via yellow_door_1, room_2 to room_4 via yellow_door_2, and room_3 to room_4 via purple_door_1. Since I'm in room_4, to get to room_1, I need to go through the connected rooms.

Possible path: room_4 to room_2 via yellow_door_2, then room_2 to room_1 via green_door_1. Or room_4 to room_3 via purple_door_1, then room_3 to room_1 via yellow_door_1. Let's check which doors are in the path. 

But all doors are locked. So I need to unlock them. To unlock a door, I have to toggle it, but to do that, I need to be in front of it. But to get in front of a door, I need to be in a room connected by that door and have no object blocking the position in front of the door. Wait, the preconditions for gotodoor: I must be in a room connected by the door, and there's no object blocking the position in front of d in the current room. So if there's an object in front of the door, I can't go there. But initially, are there any objects blocking doors?

Looking at the initial state, the objects are placed in rooms. For example, room_4 has purple_ball_1. But I don't see any information about objects blocking doors. The problem statement doesn't mention any initial blockages, except that the 'toggle' action's effect mentions that if a door was blocked by an object, picking up the object would unblock it. So perhaps doors are not initially blocked, unless objects are in front of them. Wait, the initial positions of objects: are any objects in front of doors? For example, in room_4, the purple_ball_1 is there, but unless it's in front of a door, which isn't specified. The initial state only states that objects are in rooms, but not their exact positions. So I assume that doors are not blocked unless an object is in front of them, but since the problem doesn't mention any, perhaps we can assume that initially, doors are not blocked. So, can I move in front of the doors?

So starting in room_4. The doors connected to room_4 are yellow_door_2 (connecting to room_2) and purple_door_1 (connecting to room_3). Wait, room_4 is connected to room_2 via yellow_door_2 and to room_3 via purple_door_1. So from room_4, the doors available are yellow_door_2 (to room_2) and purple_door_1 (to room_3). Both are locked. So I need to go to one of these doors, toggle them to unlock, then go through.

But to toggle a door, I need to be in front of it. So first, I need to go to the door in the current room. Let's say I choose to go through purple_door_1 first. So in room_4, I can go to purple_door_1 (since room_4 is connected to room_3 via purple_door_1). So action: gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_3. Then toggle it. Then go through to room_3. Then from room_3, go to yellow_door_1 (connecting to room_1), unlock that, go to room_1. Then in room_1, go to green_box_1. So let's outline this path.

But let's check if there are any constraints. The problem mentions constraints that the plan must abide by, but the user didn't list them here. Wait, looking back at the problem statement: "A valid plan for the abovementioned problem must abide by the following constraints:" but then nothing is listed. Hmm, maybe a formatting error. Wait, the original problem had constraints, but in the user's message, perhaps they got cut off. Wait, looking at the input again:

The user provided the problem, including constraints, but in the copy here, after "The task is to bring about the following situation...", it says "A valid plan... must abide by the following constraints:" but then there's no content. That's confusing. So maybe there are no constraints, or perhaps the user intended to include some but it's missing. Assuming there are no additional constraints beyond the preconditions and the goal.

So proceeding. The goal is to have a green box (v) in room_1, with me in room_1 and in front of v. Since green_box_1 is already in room_1, I just need to get to room_1 and go in front of it. But to get from room_4 to room_1, I need to navigate through the doors, unlocking them.

Possible path:

1. From room_4, go to purple_door_1 (connecting to room_3). But since I'm in room_4, I can do gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_3. Then toggle it to unlock. Then go through to room_3. Then from room_3, go to yellow_door_1 (connecting to room_1). Toggle that door, then go to room_1. Once in room_1, gotoobject green_box_1 room_1. Then done.

Let's check the steps:

Current location: room_4.

Action 1: gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_3. Precondition: I'm in a room connected by the door (yes, room_4 is connected via purple_door_1 to room_3). Also, no object is blocking the position in front of d in the current room. Assuming that's true. So gotodoor is possible.

Then toggle purple_door_1. Now, purple_door_1 becomes unlocked.

Then gotoroom room_4 room_3 purple_door_1. That should move me to room_3. Now in room_3.

In room_3, next step: go to yellow_door_1, which connects room_3 and room_1. So gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1. But wait, the initial state says room_1 and room_3 are connected via yellow_door_1, so yes. Then toggle yellow_door_1 (since it's locked initially). Then gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_1. Now in room_1.

Then gotoobject green_box_1 room_1. Since green_box_1 is in room_1, and I'm in room_1, this should work.

But let's check all preconditions step by step.

Starting in room_4. So:

1. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_3. Since I'm in room_4, which is connected to room_3 via purple_door_1. And no objects blocking. So allowed.

2. toggle purple_door_1. Since I'm in front of it, this action is allowed. Effect: unlock the door.

3. gotoroom room_4 room_3 purple_door_1. Since door is now unlocked, allowed. Now in room_3.

4. In room_3: gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1. Because room_3 is connected to room_1 via yellow_door_1. No blocking object. Precondition met.

5. toggle yellow_door_1. Now unlocked.

6. gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_1. Now in room_1.

7. gotoobject green_box_1 room_1. Since in room_1, and green_box_1 is here. Preconditions met.

So this plan would achieve the goal. The steps are 7 actions.

Alternative path: going through room_2. Let's see. From room_4 to room_2 via yellow_door_2. But yellow_door_2 is locked. So need to unlock it. But in room_4, can I reach yellow_door_2? Wait, yellow_door_2 connects room_2 and room_4. So in room_4, the door yellow_door_2 is present. So gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_2. Then toggle it. Then go to room_2. Then from room_2, go to green_door_1 (connects to room_1). Toggle green_door_1 (locked initially). Then go to room_1. Then gotoobject green_box_1.

This path would also work. Let's count steps:

1. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_2.

2. toggle yellow_door_2.

3. gotoroom room_4 room_2 yellow_door_2.

4. In room_2: gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_1.

5. toggle green_door_1.

6. gotoroom room_2 room_1 green_door_1.

7. gotoobject green_box_1 room_1.

Same number of steps. So which path is better? Both have 7 steps. But perhaps there's a shorter path. Wait, maybe there's a way to do it in fewer steps.

Wait, in the initial state, green_door_1 is locked, and the agent is in room_4. The two possible paths both require unlocking two doors. So either path would need the same number of steps. So the minimal plan is 7 steps. But maybe there's a way to combine steps. Wait, no, because each action is required. For example, moving through a door requires first going to the door, then toggling it, then moving through. So each door transition requires at least three actions: gotodoor, toggle, gotoroom. Wait, no. Wait, when you go to a door (gotodoor), you can then toggle it. Then to move through, you need to use gotoroom. So for each door you pass through, you need three steps: gotodoor, toggle, gotoroom. But if the door is already unlocked, you don't need to toggle. But in this problem, all doors are initially locked.

So, to get from room_4 to room_1 via room_3: requires two doors (purple_door_1 and yellow_door_1), each needing gotodoor, toggle, gotoroom. But that's 3 steps per door, so 6 steps, plus the final gotoobject. Total 7 steps. Similarly, via room_2: two doors (yellow_door_2 and green_door_1), each 3 steps, plus gotoobject. Also 7 steps. So either path is 7 steps.

But wait, maybe there's a door that can be left unlocked, but since all are locked, we need to toggle each. So the minimal steps are 7.

Alternatively, if there's a box that can be moved to unlock a door. Wait, the problem mentions that if a door is blocked by an object, picking up that object would unblock it. But initially, are any doors blocked? The problem doesn't state that any doors are blocked. So perhaps the doors are unblocked, so I can just go to them.

So the plan would be either path. Let's pick the first path through room_3 and yellow_door_1. Let's write the steps.

Another thing to check: the preconditions for gotoroom. For example, after toggling a door, it's unlocked, so gotoroom is allowed.

Let me write the plan step by step:

1. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_3
2. toggle purple_door_1
3. gotoroom room_4 room_3 purple_door_1
4. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1
5. toggle yellow_door_1
6. gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_1
7. gotoobject green_box_1 room_1

Yes, that's 7 steps. Now verify each action's preconditions.

1. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_3: in room_4, which is connected via purple_door_1 to room_3. No object blocking. Correct.

2. toggle purple_door_1: must be in front of it. Yes, after step 1.

3. gotoroom room_4 room_3 purple_door_1: door is now unlocked. Correct.

4. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1: in room_3, connected via yellow_door_1. No blocking.

5. toggle yellow_door_1: in front of it.

6. gotoroom to room_1.

7. gotoobject green_box_1 in room_1.

Yes. This plan should work. The goal is to be in room_1, in front of a green box (green_box_1 is there already). So this meets the goal.

Another possible check: is there a green box in room_1? Yes, green_box_1 is there initially. So no need to move boxes. The goal is to have such a box, which exists, so the agent just needs to be in front of it in room_1. So the plan is correct.

Therefore, this sequence should be the optimal plan with 7 steps.
