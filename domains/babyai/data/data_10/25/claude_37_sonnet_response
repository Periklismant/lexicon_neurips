Let me first understand the problem statement and the constraints to devise a valid plan. I'll start by summarizing the current state and the goal, and then analyze all constraints to understand what's required.

Initial state:
- I am in room_4
- Various objects are distributed across rooms
- All doors are locked
- I have visited room_4

Goal state:
- There is a green box (either green_box_1 or green_box_2) in room_1
- I am in room_1
- I am in front of the green box

Now, let's analyze the constraints:

1. At some point, I must be holding green_box_1 or some other object
2. At some point, I must be in room_4 (already satisfied at the start)
3. If I am in room_4, I must be holding some object at that state or later
4. At some point, I must be in front of green_box_1
5. Before being in front of green_box_1, I must have been in front of yellow_door_1
6. At some point, yellow_door_2 must be unlocked
7. Before yellow_door_2 is unlocked, I must have held blue_box_1
8. I must never be in room_2
9. At some point, I must be holding green_box_1
10. At some point, I must be holding purple_ball_1
11. At some point, I must be holding purple_ball_1 (seems redundant with constraint 10)
12. At some point, I must be in room_3 and in front of purple_door_1
13. green_door_1 must always remain locked

The most restrictive constraint is that I must never enter room_2. Given the room layout, this means:
- I can go between room_4 and room_3 using purple_door_1
- I can go between room_3 and room_1 using yellow_door_1
- I cannot use green_door_1 (which connects room_1 and room_2)
- I cannot use yellow_door_2 (which connects room_2 and room_4)

However, there's a constraint that yellow_door_2 must be unlocked at some point, and before that I must have held blue_box_1. This is tricky because I can't enter room_2, but I need to unlock yellow_door_2 which is between room_2 and room_4.

Looking more closely, I think I can unlock the door from room_4 without entering room_2. I'll need to:
1. Get blue_box_1 from room_3
2. Go to room_4 and use it to unlock yellow_door_2
3. But never actually pass through to room_2

Let me try to formulate a plan:

1. First, I need to unlock the purple_door_1 to go from room_4 to room_3
2. In room_3, I need to pick up blue_box_1
3. Return to room_4 with blue_box_1
4. While in room_4, I need to unlock yellow_door_2 (but not enter room_2)
5. I also need to pick up purple_ball_1 from room_4 at some point
6. Go to room_3, then unlock yellow_door_1
7. Go to room_1
8. Pick up green_box_1
9. Drop green_box_1 in room_1
10. Go in front of green_box_1

Let me verify if this plan satisfies all constraints:
- I will be holding green_box_1 (constraints 1, 9)
- I start in room_4 (constraint 2)
- While in room_4, I will pick up blue_box_1 and later purple_ball_1 (constraint 3)
- I will be in front of green_box_1 at the end (constraint 4)
- I'll need to be in front of yellow_door_1 before being in front of green_box_1 (constraint 5)
- I will unlock yellow_door_2 (constraint 6)
- I will hold blue_box_1 before unlocking yellow_door_2 (constraint 7)
- I will never enter room_2 (constraint 8)
- I will be holding purple_ball_1 (constraints 10, 11)
- I will be in room_3 and in front of purple_door_1 (constraint 12)
- green_door_1 will remain locked (constraint 13)

Now I'll detail the actual plan step by step.

Actually, I have a concern. Some of the constraints may be impossible to satisfy simultaneously. Let's go through a careful analysis:

1. I must never be in room_2 (constraint 8)
2. I need to unlock yellow_door_2 which connects room_2 and room_4 (constraint 6)
3. Before unlocking yellow_door_2, I must hold blue_box_1 (constraint 7)

This seems possible - I can get blue_box_1 from room_3, go to room_4, and unlock yellow_door_2 from the room_4 side.

4. I must be in front of green_box_1 (constraint 4)
5. Before being in front of green_box_1, I must have been in front of yellow_door_1 (constraint 5)

This is fine - I can go from room_3 to room_1 via yellow_door_1.

6. I must be holding green_box_1 at some point (constraint 9)
7. green_box_1 starts in room_1

So I need to go to room_1, pick up green_box_1, and then drop it in room_1 again.

Let me try to finalize the plan:

1. Initial state: I am in room_4
2. Go in front of purple_door_1
3. Toggle purple_door_1 to unlock it
4. Go to room_3 via purple_door_1
5. Go in front of blue_box_1
6. Pick up blue_box_1
7. Go in front of purple_door_1
8. Go to room_4 via purple_door_1
9. Go in front of yellow_door_2
10. Toggle yellow_door_2 (unlocks it - satisfies constraint 6)
11. Drop blue_box_1 (need empty hands for later)
12. Go in front of purple_ball_1
13. Pick up purple_ball_1 (satisfies constraints 10, 11)
14. Go in front of purple_door_1
15. Go to room_3 via purple_door_1
16. Go in front of yellow_door_1
17. Drop purple_ball_1 (need empty hands for later)
18. Toggle yellow_door_1 (unlocks it)
19. Go to room_1 via yellow_door_1
20. Go in front of green_box_1
21. Pick up green_box_1 (satisfies constraint 9)
22. Go in front of empty spot
23. Drop green_box_1
24. Go in front of green_box_1 (satisfies the goal and constraint 4)

Wait, I need to be careful about the sequence. Let me rethink parts of it:

1. Initial state: I am in room_4
2. Go in front of purple_door_1
3. Toggle purple_door_1 to unlock it
4. Go to room_3 via purple_door_1
5. Go in front of blue_box_1
6. Pick up blue_box_1 (now holding blue_box_1)
7. Go in front of purple_door_1
8. Go to room_4 via purple_door_1 (now in room_4 holding blue_box_1)
9. Go in front of yellow_door_2
10. Toggle yellow_door_2 (unlocks it - satisfies constraint 6)
11. Go in front of an empty spot
12. Drop blue_box_1 (need empty hands for later)
13. Go in front of purple_ball_1
14. Pick up purple_ball_1 (satisfies constraints 10, 11)
15. Go in front of purple_door_1
16. Go to room_3 via purple_door_1 (now in room_3 holding purple_ball_1)
17. Go in front of yellow_door_1 (satisfies constraint 5)
18. Go in front of an empty spot
19. Drop purple_ball_1 (need empty hands for later)
20. Go in front of yellow_door_1
21. Toggle yellow_door_1 (unlocks it)
22. Go to room_1 via yellow_door_1 (now in room_1)
23. Go in front of green_box_1
24. Pick up green_box_1 (satisfies constraint 9)
25. Go in front of an empty spot
26. Drop green_box_1
27. Go in front of green_box_1 (satisfies the goal and constraint 4)

Let me check if this plan satisfies all constraints:
- I am holding green_box_1 at step 24 (constraint 9)
- I start in room_4 (constraint 2)
- While in room_4, I hold blue_box_1 and purple_ball_1 (constraint 3)
- I am in front of green_box_1 at step 27 (constraint 4)
- I am in front of yellow_door_1 at step 17, before being in front of green_box_1 at step 23 (constraint 5)
- I unlock yellow_door_2 at step 10 (constraint 6)
- I hold blue_box_1 before unlocking yellow_door_2 (constraint 7)
- I never enter room_2 (constraint 8)
- I hold purple_ball_1 at steps 14-18 (constraints 10, 11)
- I am in room_3 and in front of purple_door_1 at step 7 (constraint 12)
- green_door_1 remains locked (constraint 13)

This plan should satisfy all constraints and achieve the goal. Let me finalize the formal action sequence:

Actually, constraint 12 says "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'The following conditions are all true: "you are in room_3", "you are in front of purple_door_1"'"

In my plan, I've stated "I am in room_3 and in front of purple_door_1 at step 7", but this is inaccurate. At step 7, I'm in room_3 but in front of purple_door_1. Let me fix this:

1. Initial state: I am in room_4
2. Go in front of purple_door_1
3. Toggle purple_door_1 to unlock it
4. Go to room_3 via purple_door_1
5. Go in front of blue_box_1
6. Pick up blue_box_1
7. Go in front of purple_door_1 (now I am in room_3 and in front of purple_door_1 - satisfies constraint 12)
8. Go to room_4 via purple_door_1
9. Go in front of yellow_door_2
10. Toggle yellow_door_2 (unlocks it - satisfies constraint 6)
11. Go in front of an empty spot
12. Drop blue_box_1
13. Go in front of purple_ball_1
14. Pick up purple_ball_1 (satisfies constraints 10, 11)
15. Go in front of purple_door_1
16. Go to room_3 via purple_door_1
17. Go in front of yellow_door_1 (satisfies constraint 5)
18. Go in front of an empty spot
19. Drop purple_ball_1
20. Go in front of yellow_door_1
21. Toggle yellow_door_1 (unlocks it)
22. Go to room_1 via yellow_door_1
23. Go in front of green_box_1
24. Pick up green_box_1 (satisfies constraint 9)
25. Go in front of an empty spot
26. Drop green_box_1
27. Go in front of green_box_1 (satisfies the goal and constraint 4)

This plan should now correctly satisfy all constraints. Let me format it according to the required action format:

```
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_3
toggle purple_door_1
gotoroom room_4 room_3 purple_door_1
gotoobject blue_box_1 room_3
pick blue_box_1 room_3
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_4
gotoroom room_3 room_4 purple_door_1
gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_2
toggle yellow_door_2
gotoempty
drop blue_box_1 room_4
gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4
pick purple_ball_1 room_4
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_3
gotoroom room_4 room_3 purple_door_1
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1
gotoempty
drop purple_ball_1 room_3
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1
toggle yellow_door_1
gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_1
gotoobject green_box_1 room_1
pick green_box_1 room_1
gotoempty
drop green_box_1 room_1
gotoobject green_box_1 room_1
```

Wait, I think I've made a mistake about which action to use. Let me clarify the "gotodoor" action. Looking back at the description, "gotodoor d r1 r2" means "Go in front of door d, connecting room r1 to room r2." So I need to specify the two rooms the door connects, not the room I want to go to.

Let me revise the plan:

```
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_3
toggle purple_door_1
gotoroom room_4 room_3 purple_door_1
gotoobject blue_box_1 room_3
pick blue_box_1 room_3
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_4
gotoroom room_3 room_4 purple_door_1
gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_2
toggle yellow_door_2
gotoempty
drop blue_box_1 room_4
gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4
pick purple_ball_1 room_4
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_3
gotoroom room_4 room_3 purple_door_1
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1
gotoempty
drop purple_ball_1 room_3
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1
toggle yellow_door_1
gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_1
gotoobject green_box_1 room_1
pick green_box_1 room_1
gotoempty
drop green_box_1 room_1
gotoobject green_box_1 room_1
```

Actually, I'm still not confident in the proper syntax for the "gotodoor" action. The description says:
"gotodoor d r1 r2": Go in front of door d, connecting room r1 to room r2.

Let me revise the plan one more time to ensure correctness:

```
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_3
toggle purple_door_1
gotoroom room_4 room_3 purple_door_1
gotoobject blue_box_1 room_3
pick blue_box_1 room_3
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_4
gotoroom room_3 room_4 purple_door_1
gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_2
toggle yellow_door_2
gotoempty
drop blue_box_1 room_4
gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4
pick purple_ball_1 room_4
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_3
gotoroom room_4 room_3 purple_door_1
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1
gotoempty
drop purple_ball_1 room_3
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1
toggle yellow_door_1
gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_1
gotoobject green_box_1 room_1
pick green_box_1 room_1
gotoempty
drop green_box_1 room_1
gotoobject green_box_1 room_1
```

This looks right to me now. Let me verify it one more time:

1. Initial state: I am in room_4
2. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_3 - go in front of purple_door_1
3. toggle purple_door_1 - unlock purple_door_1
4. gotoroom room_4 room_3 purple_door_1 - go to room_3
5. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_3 - go in front of blue_box_1
6. pick blue_box_1 room_3 - pick up blue_box_1 (satisfies constraint 1)
7. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_4 - go in front of purple_door_1 (satisfies constraint 12)
8. gotoroom room_3 room_4 purple_door_1 - go back to room_4 (satisfies constraint 2)
9. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_2 - go in front of yellow_door_2
10. toggle yellow_door_2 - unlock yellow_door_2 (satisfies constraint 6)
11. gotoempty - go in front of an empty spot
12. drop blue_box_1 room_4 - drop blue_box_1
13. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4 - go in front of purple_ball_1
14. pick purple_ball_1 room_4 - pick up purple_ball_1 (satisfies constraints 10, 11)
15. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_3 - go in front of purple_door_1
16. gotoroom room_4 room_3 purple_door_1 - go to room_3
17. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1 - go in front of yellow_door_1 (satisfies constraint 5)
18. gotoempty - go in front of an empty spot
19. drop purple_ball_1 room_3 - drop purple_ball_1
20. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1 - go in front of yellow_door_1
21. toggle yellow_door_1 - unlock yellow_door_1
22. gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_1 - go to room_1
23. gotoobject green_box_1 room_1 - go in front of green_box_1 (partially satisfies constraint 4)
24. pick green_box_1 room_1 - pick up green_box_1 (satisfies constraint 9)
25. gotoempty - go in front of an empty spot
26. drop green_box_1 room_1 - drop green_box_1
27. gotoobject green_box_1 room_1 - go in front of green_box_1 (satisfies the goal and constraint 4)

This plan satisfies all constraints and achieves the goal. It's also optimal in terms of the steps needed. The formal sequence of actions is:

```
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_3
toggle purple_door_1
gotoroom room_4 room_3 purple_door_1
gotoobject blue_box_1 room_3
pick blue_box_1 room_3
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_4
gotoroom room_3 room_4 purple_door_1
gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_2
toggle yellow_door_2
gotoempty
drop blue_box_1 room_4
gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4
pick purple_ball_1 room_4
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_3
gotoroom room_4 room_3 purple_door_1
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1
gotoempty
drop purple_ball_1 room_3
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1
toggle yellow_door_1
gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_1
gotoobject green_box_1 room_1
pick green_box_1 room_1
gotoempty
drop green_box_1 room_1
gotoobject green_box_1 room_1
```

Actually, I realized I haven't addressed this constraint properly:

"If expression 'you are in room_4' holds in some state s, then expression 'you are holding some object' must hold at s or at some state after s"

I start in room_4, so I need to be holding an object at that state or later. In my plan, I first move to room_3, pick up blue_box_1, then return to room_4 while holding blue_box_1. This satisfies the constraint.

I also need to check constraint 1:
"The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'At least one of the following conditions is true: "you are holding green_box_1", "you are holding some object"'"

This is satisfied at multiple points in my plan: when I'm holding blue_box_1, purple_ball_1, and green_box_1.

Constraint 3:
"If expression 'you are in room_4' holds in some state s, then expression 'you are holding some object' must hold at s or at some state after s"

This is satisfied as mentioned above.

Constraint 7:
"If expression 'yellow_door_2 is not locked' holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: 'you are holding blue_box_1'"

This is satisfied because I pick up blue_box_1 in step 6 and unlock yellow_door_2 in step 10.

Let me do another check on all constraints:

1. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'At least one of the following conditions is true: "you are holding green_box_1", "you are holding some object"'"
   - Satisfied at multiple points (steps 6-7, 14-16, 24)

2. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'you are in room_4'"
   - Satisfied at the beginning and steps 8-15

3. "If expression 'you are in room_4' holds in some state s, then expression 'you are holding some object' must hold at s or at some state after s"
   - Satisfied: I'm in room_4 at the beginning and later hold objects

4. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'you are in front of green_box_1'"
   - Satisfied at steps 23 and 27

5. "If expression 'you are in front of green_box_1' holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: 'you are in front of yellow_door_1'"
   - Satisfied: I'm in front of yellow_door_1 at step 17, before being in front of green_box_1 at step 23

6. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'yellow_door_2 is not locked'"
   - Satisfied after step 10

7. "If expression 'yellow_door_2 is not locked' holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: 'you are holding blue_box_1'"
   - Satisfied: I hold blue_box_1 at steps 6-11, before unlocking yellow_door_2 at step 10

8. "The following expression must hold in every state: 'you are not in room_2'"
   - Satisfied: I never enter room_2

9. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'you are holding green_box_1'"
   - Satisfied at step 24

10. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'you are holding purple_ball_1'"
    - Satisfied at steps 14-18

11. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'The following conditions are all true: "you are holding some object", "you are holding purple_ball_1"'"
    - Satisfied at steps 14-18

12. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'The following conditions are all true: "you are in room_3", "you are in front of purple_door_1"'"
    - Satisfied at step 7

13. "The following expression must hold in every state: 'green_door_1 is locked'"
    - Satisfied: I never toggle green_door_1

All constraints are satisfied by my plan. The plan is:

```
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_3
toggle purple_door_1
gotoroom room_4 room_3 purple_door_1
gotoobject blue_box_1 room_3
