Okay, let's tackle this planning problem step by step. The goal is to get a green box (v) into room_1, be in room_1, and be in front of v. The constraints are quite a few, so I need to make sure each one is satisfied. Let's start by understanding the initial state and the constraints.

First, initial state:
- I'm in room_4.
- The green boxes are green_box_1 in room_1 and green_box_2 in room_2. But the constraints say I can't be in room_2 at all, so green_box_2 is out of reach. So the target must be green_box_1, which is already in room_1. But I need to be in front of it in room_1. Wait, but how do I get there? Because I'm in room_4 initially.

Doors are all locked. The doors are:
- green_door_1 connects room_1 and room_2. But since we can't enter room_2, that door is irrelevant.
- yellow_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3.
- yellow_door_2 connects room_2 and room_4. Again, room_2 is forbidden.
- purple_door_1 connects room_3 and room_4.

So, to get from room_4 to room_3 via purple_door_1, but it's locked. Then from room_3 to room_1 via yellow_door_1, which is also locked. So I need to unlock these doors. But the constraints require that whenever yellow_door_2 is unlocked, I must have held blue_box_1 earlier. Wait, but yellow_door_2 connects room_2 and 4, and we can't go to room_2. So maybe we don't need to touch yellow_door_2? But the constraint says that "yellow_door_2 is not locked" must hold in at least one state, and that state must have been preceded by holding blue_box_1. But blue_box_1 is in room_3. Hmm. So I need to unlock yellow_door_2 at some point, which is in room_2/4, but since I can't be in room_2, maybe I can access it from room_4. Wait, yellow_door_2 is connecting room_4 and room_2. But room_2 is forbidden. So to unlock yellow_door_2, I need to be in front of it, which is in room_4. But how? Because to go to the door, I need to be in a room connected by it. So in room_4, can I go to yellow_door_2? The action "gotodoor d r1 r2" requires that I'm in a room connected by d. So if I'm in room_4, and yellow_door_2 connects room_4 and room_2, then I can go to yellow_door_2 from room_4. But then, if I'm in room_4, I can go to the door, toggle it (unlock) if I'm holding blue_box_1. But first, I need to get blue_box_1 from room_3. So the plan might involve going to room_3, getting blue_box_1, bringing it to room_4, then unlocking yellow_door_2. But why would I need to do that? Because the constraint says that whenever yellow_door_2 is unlocked, I must have held blue_box_1 earlier. So perhaps I need to unlock yellow_door_2 once, which requires having held blue_box_1 before. So maybe I need to pick up blue_box_1, then go to yellow_door_2 in room_4, toggle it (unlock), but then drop the blue_box_1 somewhere. But the problem is, once I unlock yellow_door_2, that satisfies the constraint. But I also need to avoid ever being in room_2. So maybe I can go to yellow_door_2 from room_4, but not enter room_2.

Other constraints:
- Must be in room_4 at least once. Initially, we are there, and the initial state counts as a state where "you are in room_4" holds. But the constraint says "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'you are in room_4'". The initial state already satisfies this. However, another constraint says that if you are in room_4 in some state, then you must be holding some object at that state or after. So in the initial state, I'm in room_4 but not holding anything. So that violates the constraint unless I pick up something in room_4 before leaving. Because the initial state is s0, and if s0 is in room_4, then in s0 or some state after, I must hold an object. But since s0 is the starting point, and I'm not holding anything, I need to pick up something in room_4 (like purple_ball_1) before leaving. But the plan's first step must include that.

Another constraint: "you are holding purple_ball_1" must be true in at least one state, and also a state where you are holding both some object and purple_ball_1. Wait, the tenth constraint is: "The following conditions are all true: 'you are holding some object', 'you are holding purple_ball_1'". But you can't hold two objects at once, so this is impossible unless the phrasing is a mistake. Wait, maybe it's a typo. Let me check the constraints again.

Wait, looking back:

"The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'The following conditions are all true: "you are holding some object", "you are holding purple_ball_1""'"

But you can only hold one object at a time. So this seems impossible. Unless the problem has a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the phrasing is meant to say that you are holding some object (which is purple_ball_1). But that would be redundant. Alternatively, maybe it's a mistake, and the intended constraint is that in some state, you are holding purple_ball_1 (which would satisfy both "holding some object" and "holding purple_ball_1"). So perhaps the correct interpretation is that the state must have both conditions, which can only be true if you are holding purple_ball_1. So I need to pick up purple_ball_1 at some point.

Another constraint: "you are in front of green_box_1" must hold in some state, and whenever that's true, there must be an earlier state where you were in front of yellow_door_1. So before being in front of green_box_1, you must have been in front of yellow_door_1.

Also, "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'you are in room_3', 'you are in front of purple_door_1'". So need to be in room_3 and in front of purple_door_1 at the same time.

Another constraint: "The following expression must hold in every state: 'green_door_1 is locked'". So we can never unlock green_door_1. So that door remains locked, meaning we can't use it. So movement from room_1 to room_2 is impossible, which is fine since we can't be in room_2.

So putting it all together:

The goal is to have a green box (green_box_1) in room_1, be in room_1, and be in front of it. Since green_box_1 is already in room_1, perhaps I just need to get to room_1 and position myself in front of it. But how?

But the initial position is room_4. To get to room_1, the path would be room_4 → room_3 via purple_door_1 (needs unlocking), then room_3 → room_1 via yellow_door_1 (needs unlocking). Then in room_1, go to green_box_1. But there are constraints along the way.

Let's outline the steps:

1. Start in room_4. Must pick up an object here (purple_ball_1) to satisfy the constraint that if in room_4, then hold something in that state or after. So first, pick up purple_ball_1 in room_4.

But to pick up, need to be in front of it. So first, gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4, then pick it.

Then, need to unlock purple_door_1 to go to room_3. So go to purple_door_1 in room_4 (gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_3), then toggle it (unlock). Then go to room_3 via gotoroom room_4 room_3 purple_door_1.

But after entering room_3, I need to pick up blue_box_1 to satisfy the constraint that when yellow_door_2 is unlocked, I had held blue_box_1 earlier. So in room_3, go to blue_box_1, pick it up.

Then, perhaps return to room_4, go to yellow_door_2, toggle it (unlock), which requires being in front of it. Since yellow_door_2 connects room_2 and 4, but we can't go to room_2. So in room_4, gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_2. Then toggle to unlock. But since we have blue_box_1 in hand, this meets the precondition for the constraint. Then, we can drop blue_box_1 somewhere (maybe in room_4), but need to hold it before toggling yellow_door_2.

Wait, the constraint says: if yellow_door_2 is not locked in some state, there must be an earlier state where you held blue_box_1. So after picking up blue_box_1 in room_3, if I then go to room_4, unlock yellow_door_2, that's okay. Because the action of unlocking yellow_door_2 (toggle) requires being in front of it, and after that, yellow_door_2 is unlocked. The constraint is that in the state where yellow_door_2 is unlocked, there must have been a previous state where I held blue_box_1. So as long as I pick up blue_box_1 before unlocking yellow_door_2, that's satisfied.

So steps so far:

1. In room_4: gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4
2. pick purple_ball_1 room_4
3. Now holding purple_ball_1. Need to go to purple_door_1. So gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_3
4. toggle purple_door_1 (unlocks it)
5. gotoroom room_4 room_3 purple_door_1 (now in room_3)
6. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_3
7. pick blue_box_1 room_3 (now holding blue_box_1)
8. Need to go back to room_4 to unlock yellow_door_2. So gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_4 (since purple_door_1 is now unlocked)
9. toggle purple_door_1? Wait, no. Wait, after step 4, we toggled purple_door_1 (unlocked it). Then in step 5, we used it to go to room_3. Now, when in room_3, to return to room_4, we can use the same door. So:

8. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_4
9. gotoroom room_3 room_4 purple_door_1 (back to room_4)
10. Now, in room_4, need to go to yellow_door_2. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_2
11. toggle yellow_door_2 (unlocks it)
12. Now, yellow_door_2 is unlocked. This satisfies the constraint that in some state, yellow_door_2 is not locked. And since we picked up blue_box_1 earlier (step7), the constraint is satisfied.

Now, after this, need to proceed to room_1. To get to room_1 from room_4, the path would be room_4 → room_3 via purple_door_1 (already unlocked), then room_3 → room_1 via yellow_door_1 (which is locked). So need to unlock yellow_door_1.

But to unlock yellow_door_1, which connects room_1 and room_3, I need to be in front of it. So from room_3, gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1. Then toggle it (unlock). But yellow_door_1 is initially locked, so toggling it will unlock. But the preconditions for toggle are that you are in front of the door. So steps:

13. After step 11, I'm in room_4. Need to go back to room_3.

Wait, step 9: after step 9, I'm back in room_4. Then steps 10-12: in room_4, unlock yellow_door_2. Then need to go back to room_3 again. So:

13. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_3
14. gotoroom room_4 room_3 purple_door_1 (now in room_3)
15. Now, need to unlock yellow_door_1. So gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1
16. toggle yellow_door_1 (unlocks it)
17. Now, go to room_1 via yellow_door_1: gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_1
18. Now in room_1. Need to go to green_box_1. So gotoobject green_box_1 room_1
19. Then drop any object if needed? Wait, the goal is to be in front of green_box_1 in room_1. So step 18 would put me in front of green_box_1. But wait, the initial state says green_box_1 is in room_1, but after I pick it up and drop it again, it would still be in room_1. Wait, but the goal is that there exists a box v (green and in room_1). Since green_box_1 is already in room_1, the goal is satisfied as long as I'm in room_1 and in front of it. So step 18 would satisfy the goal. But let's check the constraints.

Constraints to check:

- Must hold green_box_1 in at least one state. So need to pick it up at some point. But the goal doesn't require moving it, just being in front of it. So if I can get in front of it without picking it up, that's better. But to be in front of it, I need to use the gotoobject action. So steps would be:

After entering room_1 (step 17), then:

18. gotoobject green_box_1 room_1

That puts me in front of green_box_1. Then the goal is achieved.

But the constraint says that whenever you are in front of green_box_1, there must have been an earlier state where you were in front of yellow_door_1. So before step 18, there must be a step where I was in front of yellow_door_1. That would be step 15 (gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1) and step 16 (toggle). So step 15 puts me in front of yellow_door_1, which satisfies that.

Other constraints:

- Must be in front of green_box_1 (step 18).

- Must have been in room_4 (initial state counts, but also when we went back to room_4 steps 9-12. However, when we were in room_4 after step 9, we were holding blue_box_1 (from step7). So the constraint that whenever in room_4, you must hold an object in that state or after is satisfied because in step 9, when entering room_4, you're holding blue_box_1. Then in step 11, when toggling yellow_door_2, you're still holding it. Then you can drop it later if needed. But according to the plan so far, we're still holding blue_box_1 until when? Let's see:

After step7: holding blue_box_1.

Steps 8-9: moving back to room_4, still holding it.

Steps10-12: goto yellow_door_2 in room_4, toggle it (unlock), still holding blue_box_1.

Then steps13-14: moving back to room_3. Still holding blue_box_1.

Then steps15-17: unlock yellow_door_1, move to room_1. Still holding blue_box_1.

But then, in room_1, need to drop it somewhere to be able to pick green_box_1? Wait, the goal doesn't require picking green_box_1, just being in front of it. So perhaps we don't need to pick it. But one of the constraints is that "you are holding green_box_1" must be true in at least one state. So we need to pick it up. So after step18 (gotoobject green_box_1), we can pick it up.

But then, after that, we need to drop it again to be in front of it? Wait, the goal is to be in front of it. So perhaps:

18. gotoobject green_box_1 room_1 (now in front of it)
19. pick green_box_1 room_1 (now holding it, which satisfies the constraint)
20. Then drop it again? But why? Because the goal is to be in front of it. If we pick it up, then we are no longer in front of it (due to the effect of pick). Wait, the effect of pick is that you are no longer in front of x. So after picking, you're not in front. So to satisfy the goal, which is to be in front of v (green_box_1) in room_1, we need to be in front of it at the end. So the sequence would have to end with gotoobject green_box_1 room_1. But after picking it up, you can't do that unless you drop it again. Hmm.

Wait, the goal is "There is a box v such that: v is green, in room_1, you are in room_1, and you are in front of v." So v is green_box_1. So the final state must have me in room_1, in front of green_box_1, and green_box_1 is in room_1. So if I pick it up, then green_box_1 is no longer in room_1 (as per the pick effect). So I can't pick it up and then drop it again. Because that would require me to drop it in room_1, which is allowed. So steps could be:

18. gotoobject green_box_1 room_1 (now in front of it)
19. pick green_box_1 room_1 (now holding it, which satisfies the constraint)
20. drop green_box_1 room_1 (now it's back in room_1, and you're in front of it)

But dropping requires that the position in front is empty. After picking, you are no longer in front of it. So to drop, you need to be in front of an empty position. So after step19, you're not in front of anything. Then you need to gotoempty to be in front of an empty spot, then drop. But this complicates things.

Alternatively, perhaps after moving to room_1, go to green_box_1, pick it up (to satisfy the constraint of holding it), then drop it again in room_1. But how?

So:

After step17, in room_1.

18. gotoobject green_box_1 room_1
19. pick green_box_1 room_1 (now holding it)
20. gotoempty room_1 (to find an empty spot)
21. drop green_box_1 room_1 (now it's in room_1 again, and you're in front of it)

But step21 would require that after dropping, you are in front of it. Wait, the effect of drop is: (i) you are no longer carrying x, (ii) you are in front of x, (iii) your hands are empty, (iv) x is in the current room. So when you drop, you end up in front of x. So step21 would put you in front of green_box_1. So that would satisfy the goal.

But then the steps would be:

17. gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_1 (now in room_1)
18. gotoobject green_box_1 room_1
19. pick green_box_1 room_1 (now holding it)
20. drop green_box_1 room_1 (now in front of it, and it's in room_1)

This would achieve the goal. Also, step19 satisfies the constraint of holding green_box_1, and step20 puts us in front of it.

But let's check other constraints:

- The constraint that in some state, you are holding purple_ball_1. We picked it up in step2 and then... when do we drop it? Because after step2, we are holding purple_ball_1. Then in step7, we pick up blue_box_1, which requires dropping purple_ball_1 first. Wait, no: the preconditions for pick require that you are not holding any object. So after step2, we have purple_ball_1. Then in step3, we go to purple_door_1, toggle it (step4), then go to room_3 (step5). Then in step6, gotoobject blue_box_1, but to pick it up (step7), we need to not be holding anything. So we must have dropped purple_ball_1 before step7. But when? Because in step5, we moved to room_3. So perhaps after entering room_3 (step5), we need to drop purple_ball_1.

Wait, this is a problem. Because in step2, we pick up purple_ball_1, then in step3, we go to the door. Then step4: toggle the door (unlock). Step5: go to room_3. Now, in room_3, we need to pick up blue_box_1. But to pick up blue_box_1, we must not be holding anything. So we need to drop purple_ball_1 in room_3 before step7.

But when? After entering room_3 (step5), we are in room_3, holding purple_ball_1. So steps would be:

5. gotoroom room_4 room_3 purple_door_1 (now in room_3, holding purple_ball_1)
6. gotoempty room_3 (to find an empty spot)
7. drop purple_ball_1 room_3 (now not holding anything, and purple_ball_1 is in room_3)
8. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_3
9. pick blue_box_1 room_3 (now holding blue_box_1)

But this adds steps. However, this way, we satisfy the constraint that we held purple_ball_1 (step2-7). Also, the constraint that "you are holding purple_ball_1" and "you are holding some object" (since when holding purple_ball_1, you are holding some object). So that's covered.

But then, after dropping purple_ball_1 in room_3, we need to pick it up again to satisfy the constraint that "you are holding purple_ball_1" in some state. Wait, no. Because we already held it in steps 2-7. The constraint says "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'you are holding purple_ball_1'". So step2-7 (holding it) satisfies that. But the tenth constraint says: "The following conditions are all true: 'you are holding some object', 'you are holding purple_ball_1'". Which is redundant because if you're holding purple_ball_1, you're holding some object. So that's satisfied in step2-7.

But then, when we drop purple_ball_1 in room_3, it's there. But later, we need to hold it again? Not necessarily. The constraints don't require that we hold it again, just that at some point we did.

So adjusting the steps:

1. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4
2. pick purple_ball_1 room_4 (holding it)
3. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_3
4. toggle purple_door_1 (unlock)
5. gotoroom room_4 room_3 purple_door_1 (now in room_3, holding purple_ball_1)
6. gotoempty room_3
7. drop purple_ball_1 room_3 (now in front of it, but not holding)
8. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_3
9. pick blue_box_1 room_3 (now holding blue_box_1)
10. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_4
11. toggle purple_door_1 (lock it again? Wait, no, we need to return to room_4. Wait, after step4, purple_door_1 is unlocked. So when we go back from room_3 to room_4 via purple_door_1 (step10: gotodoor, step11: gotoroom), the door is unlocked. So steps:

10. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_4
11. gotoroom room_3 room_4 purple_door_1 (now in room_4)
12. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_2
13. toggle yellow_door_2 (unlock)
14. Now, need to go back to room_3 to proceed to room_1. So:

14. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_3
15. gotoroom room_4 room_3 purple_door_1 (now in room_3)
16. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1
17. toggle yellow_door_1 (unlock)
18. gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_1 (now in room_1)
19. gotoobject green_box_1 room_1
20. pick green_box_1 room_1 (now holding it)
21. drop green_box_1 room_1 (now in front of it)

But step21 requires that after dropping, you're in front of it, which satisfies the goal.

Now checking all constraints:

- Must hold green_box_1 (step20).
- Must hold purple_ball_1 (step2-6).
- Must be in room_4 at least once (initial and steps11).
- When in room_4 (steps11), must be holding an object (blue_box_1 in steps11-13).
- Must be in front of green_box_1 (step19 and step21). The requirement is that before step19 or 21, there was a step where you were in front of yellow_door_1. That's step16 (gotodoor yellow_door_1) and step17 (toggle).
- yellow_door_2 must be unlocked (step13), and before that, held blue_box_1 (steps9-13).
- Must be in room_3 and in front of purple_door_1: when in room_3, step10 (gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room4), which puts you in front of it. So step10 satisfies that.
- Every state: not in room_2. Check all steps: no movement to room_2.
- green_door_1 remains locked. Since we never interact with it.

Also, the constraint that in every state, green_door_1 is locked. Since we never toggle it, it remains locked.

Another constraint: "If you are in room_4 in some state, you must hold an object in that state or after." In step11, after entering room_4, you are holding blue_box_1 (from step9). Then steps12-13: still holding it. So that's okay.

Now, let's count the steps and see if any can be optimized. For example, after step13 (unlocking yellow_door_2), do we need to go back to room_3? Yes, to proceed to room_1.

But perhaps there's a way to shorten the plan. Let's see:

Alternative approach: After unlocking yellow_door_2, instead of going back to room_3, can we go directly to room_1 via another path? No, because from room_4, the only doors are purple_door_1 (to room3) and yellow_door_2 (to room2, which is forbidden). So the only path is room4→3→1.

Another optimization: When in room3 after dropping purple_ball_1, pick blue_box_1, go back to room4 to unlock yellow_door_2, then return to room3 to unlock yellow_door_1. That's what we have.

Is this the minimal path? It seems so. Let's verify all steps:

1. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4
2. pick purple_ball_1 room_4
3. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_3
4. toggle purple_door_1
5. gotoroom room_4 room_3 purple_door_1
6. gotoempty room_3
7. drop purple_ball_1 room_3
8. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_3
9. pick blue_box_1 room_3
10. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_4
11. gotoroom room_3 room_4 purple_door_1
12. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_2
13. toggle yellow_door_2
14. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_3
15. gotoroom room_4 room_3 purple_door_1
16. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1
17. toggle yellow_door_1
18. gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_1
19. gotoobject green_box_1 room_1
20. pick green_box_1 room_1
21. drop green_box_1 room_1

This is 21 steps. But perhaps some steps can be merged. For example, after step5 (in room3), can we immediately drop purple_ball_1 without going to empty? No, because to drop, you must be in front of an empty position. So you need to gotoempty first.

Alternatively, maybe after entering room3 (step5), you are not in front of anything. So you can directly drop purple_ball_1 if you are in front of an empty spot. Wait, the effect of gotoroom is that you are no longer in front of anything. So after step5, you are in room3, not in front of any object or door. So to drop purple_ball_1, you need to be in front of an empty spot. So you must perform gotoempty first.

Yes, so step6 is necessary.

Another possible optimization: after step9 (holding blue_box_1), when returning to room4, can we toggle yellow_door_2 directly? Steps10-13 are necessary.

Now, checking if all constraints are met:

- Must be in room_4 at least once: yes (steps1, 11-13).

- If in room_4, must hold an object then or later: in steps11-13, holding blue_box_1.

- Must be in front of green_box_1: steps19 and 21.

- Before that, in front of yellow_door_1: step16.

- yellow_door_2 unlocked (step13), and before that, held blue_box_1 (step9).

- In room3 and in front of purple_door_1: step10 (gotodoor purple_door_1 room3 room4).

- Every state not in room2: yes.

- green_door_1 locked always: yes.

- Must hold green_box_1 (step20).

- Must hold purple_ball_1 (step2-7).

- The combined holding of some object and purple_ball_1 is satisfied in step2-7.

Thus, the plan meets all constraints.
