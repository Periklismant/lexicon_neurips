Let me analyze this grid world planning problem step by step, understand the constraints, and then develop an optimal plan.

First, I need to understand the initial state:
- I am in room_4
- There are various boxes and balls in different rooms
- All doors are locked
- I'm not holding any object

The goal is:
- I should be in room_2
- There should be a red box in room_2
- I should be in front of that red box

The constraints are numerous, but I'll need to satisfy all of them while reaching the goal.

Let me construct a mental map of the grid world:
```
+----------+----------+
|  room_1  |  room_3  |
| blue_box | purple_b |
| green_box| red_ball1|
|          | red_ball2|
+----------+----------+
|  room_2  |  room_4  |
| yellow_b | yellow_b2|
| red_box  |    me    |
+----------+----------+
```

The doors are: 
- yellow_door_1: between room_1 and room_2
- red_door_1: between room_1 and room_3
- grey_door_1: between room_2 and room_4
- green_door_1: between room_3 and room_4

Now, let me analyze the constraints to understand what I need to do:

1. I must hold some object at some point
2. grey_door_1 must be locked at some point (it starts locked, so this is initially satisfied)
3. After grey_door_1 is locked, I must either unlock green_door_1 or be in front of yellow_door_1
4. grey_door_1 must be unlocked at some point
5. Before grey_door_1 is unlocked, I must either be in room_3 or holding yellow_box_1
6. At some point, I must be in room_3 holding green_box_1
7. At some point, I must be in front of red_box_1
8. Before being in front of red_box_1, I must be in front of an empty position
9. At some point, I must hold either red_box_1 or green_box_1
10. At some point, I must be holding some object while purple_box_1 is in room_4
11. At some point, I must be in front of grey_door_1
12. After being in front of grey_door_1, either red_ball_1 must be in room_1 or grey_door_1 must be locked
13. At some point, I must be in room_4 (already satisfied in the initial state)
14. After being in room_4, I must visit room_1 at some point
15. At some point, I must either be in front of yellow_box_1 or holding some object

To summarize, I need to:
1. Move to room_3 (through green_door_1)
2. Pick up green_box_1 from room_1 and bring it to room_3
3. Move red_ball_1 to room_1
4. Move purple_box_1 to room_4
5. Unlock grey_door_1 after being in room_3 or holding yellow_box_1
6. Go to room_2
7. Go in front of red_box_1
8. Make sure I go in front of an empty position before going in front of red_box_1

Let me try to construct a plan. I'll think carefully about the order of operations to satisfy all constraints.

Starting in room_4:
1. First, I need to unlock a door to get out of room_4. The green_door_1 connects to room_3, so I'll start with that.
   - goto door green_door_1 room_4 room_3
   - toggle green_door_1

2. Now I can go to room_3
   - gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1

3. In room_3, I see purple_box_1, red_ball_1, and red_ball_2
   - I need to pick up green_box_1 from room_1, but I need to go through room_3 to get there

4. To get to room_1, I need to unlock red_door_1
   - gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1
   - toggle red_door_1

5. Now I can go to room_1
   - gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1

6. In room_1, I want to pick up green_box_1
   - gotoobject green_box_1 room_1
   - pick green_box_1 room_1

7. Return to room_3 (need to hold green_box_1 in room_3 as per constraint 6)
   - gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1

8. Now I'm in room_3 holding green_box_1 (satisfies constraint 6). I need to move red_ball_1 to room_1 and purple_box_1 to room_4. Let me drop green_box_1 first
   - gotoempty
   - drop green_box_1 room_3

9. Now pick up red_ball_1
   - gotoobject red_ball_1 room_3
   - pick red_ball_1 room_3

10. Take red_ball_1 to room_1
    - gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1
    - gotoempty
    - drop red_ball_1 room_1

11. Return to room_3
    - gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1

12. Pick up purple_box_1
    - gotoobject purple_box_1 room_3
    - pick purple_box_1 room_3

13. Take purple_box_1 to room_4
    - gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_1
    - gotoempty
    - drop purple_box_1 room_4

14. Now I'm in room_4 with purple_box_1 (satisfies constraint 10)

15. I need to go to room_2, but grey_door_1 is locked. I need to go to the door and unlock it
    - gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_2
    - toggle grey_door_1

16. Now I can go to room_2
    - gotoroom room_4 room_2 grey_door_1

17. In room_2, I need to go to an empty spot before I go in front of red_box_1 (constraint 8)
    - gotoempty

18. Now go in front of red_box_1 (satisfies constraint 7)
    - gotoobject red_box_1 room_2

Now I check if I have satisfied all the constraints:

1. ✓ I held several objects during the plan
2. ✓ grey_door_1 was locked initially
3. ✓ After grey_door_1 was locked, I unlocked green_door_1
4. ✓ grey_door_1 was unlocked at some point
5. ? Before grey_door_1 is unlocked, I must either be in room_3 or holding yellow_box_1.
   - I was in room_3 before unlocking grey_door_1, so this is satisfied
6. ✓ I was in room_3 holding green_box_1
7. ✓ I went in front of red_box_1
8. ✓ I went to an empty position before going in front of red_box_1
9. ✓ I held green_box_1
10. ✓ I was holding purple_box_1 while it was in room_4
11. ✓ I went in front of grey_door_1
12. ✓ After being in front of grey_door_1, red_ball_1 was in room_1
13. ✓ I was in room_4
14. ✓ After being in room_4, I visited room_1
15. ✓ I held objects during the plan

I think I've satisfied all the constraints. Let me double check if I've reached the goal:
- I am in room_2
- I'm in front of red_box_1
- red_box_1 is in room_2

Yes, that's the goal state. Let me review the plan once more to make sure it's correct:

1. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3
2. toggle green_door_1
3. gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1
4. gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1
5. toggle red_door_1
6. gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1
7. gotoobject green_box_1 room_1
8. pick green_box_1 room_1
9. gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1
10. gotoempty
11. drop green_box_1 room_3
12. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_3
13. pick red_ball_1 room_3
14. gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1
15. gotoempty
16. drop red_ball_1 room_1
17. gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1
18. gotoobject purple_box_1 room_3
19. pick purple_box_1 room_3
20. gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_1
21. gotoempty
22. drop purple_box_1 room_4
23. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_2
24. toggle grey_door_1
25. gotoroom room_4 room_2 grey_door_1
26. gotoempty
27. gotoobject red_box_1 room_2

Wait, I'm checking constraint 5 again: Before grey_door_1 is unlocked, I must either be in room_3 or holding yellow_box_1. I was in room_3 earlier in the plan, but the constraint seems to suggest I need to be in room_3 or holding yellow_box_1 immediately before unlocking grey_door_1. I've gone from room_3 to room_4 before unlocking grey_door_1, so I might need to re-order my actions.

Also, let me check constraint 9: At some point, I must hold either red_box_1 or green_box_1. I held green_box_1, so this is satisfied.

Let me revise my plan to make sure I satisfy all constraints properly, particularly constraint 5:

1. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3
2. toggle green_door_1
3. gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1
4. gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1
5. toggle red_door_1
6. gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1
7. gotoobject green_box_1 room_1
8. pick green_box_1 room_1
9. gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1
   (Now I'm in room_3 holding green_box_1, satisfying constraint 6)
10. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_3
    (I can't pick up red_ball_1 since I'm already holding green_box_1. I need to drop green_box_1 first)
11. gotoempty
12. drop green_box_1 room_3
13. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_3
14. pick red_ball_1 room_3
15. gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1
16. gotoempty
17. drop red_ball_1 room_1
    (Now red_ball_1 is in room_1, which will satisfy constraint 12 later)
18. gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1
19. gotoobject purple_box_1 room_3
20. pick purple_box_1 room_3
21. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_2
    (Wait, I'm in room_3, and there's no direct connection from room_3 to room_2)
    (I need to go through room_4 to get to room_2)
21. gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_1
    (Now I'm in room_4 holding purple_box_1)
22. gotoempty
23. drop purple_box_1 room_4
    (Now I'm in room_4, purple_box_1 is in room_4, satisfying constraint 10)
24. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_2
    (Now I'm in front of grey_door_1, satisfying constraint 11)
25. toggle grey_door_1
    (grey_door_1 is now unlocked, satisfying constraint 4)
    (Constraint 5 says before grey_door_1 is unlocked, I must be in room_3 or holding yellow_box_1. I was in room_3 earlier, but not right before this. I might need to get yellow_box_1)
    (Let me go back and change the plan)

Let me reconsider the plan from the beginning, particularly focusing on constraint 5:

1. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3
2. toggle green_door_1
3. gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1
   (Now I'm in room_3)
4. gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1
5. toggle red_door_1
6. gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1
   (Now I'm in room_1)
7. gotoobject green_box_1 room_1
8. pick green_box_1 room_1
   (Now I'm holding green_box_1)
9. gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1
   (Now I'm in room_3 holding green_box_1, satisfying constraint 6)
10. gotoempty
11. drop green_box_1 room_3
    (Now I'm in front of green_box_1)
12. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_3
13. pick red_ball_1 room_3
    (Now I'm holding red_ball_1)
14. gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1
    (Now I'm in room_1 holding red_ball_1)
15. gotoempty
16. drop red_ball_1 room_1
    (Now red_ball_1 is in room_1, which will satisfy constraint 12 later)
17. gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1
    (Wait, yellow_door_1 is locked. I need to unlock it first)
17. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2
18. toggle yellow_door_1
    (Now yellow_door_1 is unlocked)
19. gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1
    (Now I'm in room_2)
20. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_2
21. pick yellow_box_1 room_2
    (Now I'm holding yellow_box_1, which will help satisfy constraint 5)
22. gotoroom room_2 room_4 grey_door_1
    (Wait, grey_door_1 is locked. But I want to approach it from room_4 anyway)
22. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_4
    (Now I'm in front of grey_door_1 from room_2)
23. toggle grey_door_1
    (Now grey_door_1 is unlocked, satisfying constraint 4)
    (Constraint 5 says before grey_door_1 is unlocked, I must be in room_3 or holding yellow_box_1. I'm holding yellow_box_1, so this is satisfied)
24. gotoroom room_2 room_4 grey_door_1
    (Now I'm in room_4 holding yellow_box_1)
25. gotoempty
26. drop yellow_box_1 room_4
    (Now I've dropped yellow_box_1 in room_4)
27. gotoobject purple_box_1 room_3
    (Wait, I'm in room_4 and purple_box_1 is in room_3. I need to go to room_3 first)
27. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3
28. gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1
    (Now I'm in room_3)
29. gotoobject purple_box_1 room_3
30. pick purple_box_1 room_3
    (Now I'm holding purple_box_1)
31. gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_1
    (Now I'm in room_4 holding purple_box_1, satisfying constraint 10)
32. gotoempty
33. drop purple_box_1 room_4
    (Now I've dropped purple_box_1 in room_4)
34. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_2
    (Now I'm in front of grey_door_1, satisfying constraint 11)
    (Constraint 12 says after being in front of grey_door_1, red_ball_1 must be in room_1 or grey_door_1 must be locked. red_ball_1 is already in room_1, so this is satisfied)
35. gotoroom room_4 room_2 grey_door_1
    (Now I'm in room_2)
36. gotoempty
    (Now I'm in front of an empty position, which satisfies part of constraint 8)
37. gotoobject red_box_1 room_2
    (Now I'm in front of red_box_1, satisfying constraint 7 and the other part of constraint 8)

Wait, let's check if all doors are in the right state now:
- green_door_1: unlocked
- yellow_door_1: unlocked
- red_door_1: unlocked
- grey_door_1: unlocked

Let me check constraints again:
1. ✓ I held objects during the plan
2. ✓ grey_door_1 was locked initially
3. ? After grey_door_1 is locked, I must either unlock green_door_1 or be in front of yellow_door_1
   - I unlocked green_door_1 at the beginning, so this is satisfied
4. ✓ grey_door_1 was unlocked
5. ✓ Before grey_door_1 is unlocked, I was holding yellow_box_1
6. ✓ I was in room_3 holding green_box_1
7. ✓ I went in front of red_box_1
8. ✓ I went to an empty position before going in front of red_box_1
9. ✓ I held green_box_1
10. ✓ I was holding purple_box_1 while it was in room_4
11. ✓ I went in front of grey_door_1
12. ✓ After being in front of grey_door_1, red_ball_1 was in room_1
13. ✓ I was in room_4
14. ✓ After being in room_4, I visited room_1
15. ✓ I held objects during the plan

Let me check if I've reached the goal state:
- I am in room_2
- I'm in front of red_box_1
- red_box_1 is in room_2

Yes, that's the goal state. 

However, I realized there's still an issue with my plan. I'm not sure I handled the doors correctly. Let me make sure I understand the state transitions properly:

1. Initially, all doors are locked
2. I go to green_door_1 and toggle it, making it unlocked
3. I go through green_door_1 to room_3
4. I go to red_door_1 and toggle it, making it unlocked
5. I go through red_door_1 to room_1
6. I go to yellow_door_1 and toggle it, making it unlocked
7. I go through yellow_door_1 to room_2
8. I go to grey_door_1 and toggle it, making it unlocked
9. I go through grey_door_1 to room_4

I think there's some confusion with my door navigation. Let me rewrite the plan more carefully:

1. Initially, I'm in room_4, and all doors are locked.
2. I go to green_door_1:
   - gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3
3. I unlock green_door_1:
   - toggle green_door_1
4. I go to room_3:
   - gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1
5. I go to red_door_1:
   - gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1
6. I unlock red_door_1:
   - toggle red_door_1
7. I go to room_1:
   - gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1
8. I go to green_box_1:
   - gotoobject green_box_1 room_1
9. I pick up green_box_1:
   - pick green_box_1 room_1
10. I go back to room_3:
    - gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1
    (Now I'm in room_3 holding green_box_1, satisfying constraint 6)
11. I find an empty position:
    - gotoempty
12. I drop green_box_1:
    - drop green_box_1 room_3
13. I go to red_ball_1:
    - gotoobject red_ball_1 room_3
14. I pick up red_ball_1:
    - pick red_ball_1 room_3
15. I go back to room_1:
    - gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1
16. I find an empty position:
    - gotoempty
17. I drop red_ball_1:
    - drop red_ball_1 room_1
    (Now red_ball_1 is in room_1, which satisfies constraint 12)
18. I go to yellow_door_1:
    - gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2
19. I unlock yellow_door_1:
    - toggle yellow_door_1
20. I go to room_2:
    - gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1
21. I go to yellow_box_1:
    - gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_2
22. I pick up yellow_box_1:
    - pick yellow_box_1 room_2
    (Now I'm holding yellow_box_1, which satisfies constraint 5 for when I later unlock grey_door_1)
23. I go to grey_door_1:
    - gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_4
24. I unlock grey_door_1:
    - toggle grey_door_1
    (grey_door_1 is now unlocked, satisfying constraint 4)
25. I go to room_4:
    - gotoroom room_2 room_4 grey_door_1
26. I find an empty position:
    - gotoempty
27. I drop yellow_box_1:
    - drop yellow_box_1 room_4
28. I go back to room_3:
    - gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3
    - gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1
29. I go to purple_box_1:
    - gotoobject purple_box_1 room_3
30. I pick up purple_box_1:
    - pick purple_box_1 room_3
31. I go back to room_4:
    - gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_1
    (Now I'm in room_4 holding purple_box_1, satisfying constraint 10)
32. I find an empty position:
    - gotoempty
33. I drop purple_box_1:
    - drop purple_box_1 room_4
34. I go back to grey_door_1:
    - gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_2
    (Now I'm in front of grey_door_1, satisfying constraint 11)
35. I go to room_2:
    - gotoroom room_4 room_2 grey_door_1
36. I find an empty position:
    - gotoempty
    (Now I'm in front of an empty position, satisfying part of constraint 8)
37. I go to red_box_1:
    - gotoobject red_box_1 room_2
    (Now I'm in front of red_box_1, satisfying constraint 7 and completing constraint 8)

This should reach the goal state while satisfying all constraints. Let me double check:
1. ✓ I held objects during the plan
2. ✓ grey_door_1 was locked initially
3. ✓ After grey_door_1 is locked, I unlocked green_door_1
4. ✓ grey_door_1 was unlocked
5. ✓ Before grey_door_1 is unlocked, I was holding yellow_box_1
6. ✓ I was in room_3 holding green_box_1
7. ✓ I went in front of red_box_1
8. ✓ I went to an empty position before going in front of red_box_1
9. ✓ I held green_box_1
10. ✓ I was holding purple_box_1 while it was in room_4
11. ✓ I went in front of grey_door_1
12. ✓ After being in front of grey_door_1, red_ball_1 was in room_1
13. ✓ I was in room_4
14. ✓ After being in room_4, I visited room_1
15. ✓ I held objects during the plan

And the goal state:
- I am in room_2
- I'm in front of red_box_1
- red_box_1 is in room_2

Yes, I have satisfied all constraints and reached the goal state. This is the final plan:

1. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3
2. toggle green_door_1
3. gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1
4. gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1
5. toggle red_door_1
6. gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1
7. gotoobject green_box_1 room_1
8. pick green_box_1 room_1
9. gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1

14. gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1
15. gotoempty
16. drop red_ball_1 room_1
17. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2
18. toggle yellow_door_1
19. gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1
20. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_2
21. pick yellow_box_1 room_2
22. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_4
23. toggle grey_door_1
24. gotoroom room_2 room_4 grey_door_1

26. drop yellow_box_1 room_4
27. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3
28. gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1
29. gotoobject purple_box_1 room_3
30. pick purple_box_1 room_3
31. gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_1
32. gotoempty
33. drop purple_box_1 room_4
34. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_2
35. gotoroom room_4 room_2 grey_door_1
36. gotoempty
37. gotoobject red_box_1 room_2
