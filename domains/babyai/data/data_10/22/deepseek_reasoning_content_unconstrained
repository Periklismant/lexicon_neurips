Okay, let's tackle this planning problem step by step. The goal is to have a red box in room_2, with me in room_2 and in front of that box. Let's start by understanding the initial state and the constraints.

First, the initial state: I'm in room_4. The red boxes are red_box_1 in room_2 and the red_balls are in room_3. Wait, the boxes are green_box_1, yellow_box_1, red_box_1, etc. So red_box_1 is already in room_2. But the goal is to have a red box in room_2, which is already true. However, the goal also requires me to be in room_2 and in front of that box. So maybe I just need to get to room_2 and be in front of red_box_1. But wait, are there any constraints that might prevent that?

Looking at the constraints: The plan must not pick up or drop any ball, and must not use the green_door_1. Also, must not toggle any door unless it's necessary. So I need to find a path from room_4 to room_2 without using green_door_1. The doors connecting rooms are:

- room_1 and room_2 via yellow_door_1 (locked)
- room_1 and room_3 via red_door_1 (locked)
- room_2 and room_4 via grey_door_1 (locked)
- room_3 and room_4 via green_door_1 (locked)

So all doors are initially locked. So to move between rooms, I need to unlock the doors. But the constraints say I can't toggle any door unless necessary. So maybe I need to find the minimal doors to toggle. Let's see the path from room_4 to room_2.

Possible paths: room_4 is connected to room_2 via grey_door_1 and to room_3 via green_door_1. But I can't use green_door_1 due to constraints. So the only direct path is via grey_door_1 from room_4 to room_2. But that door is locked. So I need to toggle it. But to toggle a door, I need to be in front of it. But to get in front of it, I need to be in a room connected by that door. So in room_4, grey_door_1 connects to room_2. So I can go to the grey_door_1 from room_4, then toggle it to unlock, then go through to room_2. Once in room_2, go to red_box_1 and be in front of it.

Wait, but how do I get in front of the grey_door_1 in room_4? The "goto door" action requires that there's no object blocking the position in front of the door in the current room. In room_4, the objects are yellow_box_2. So if yellow_box_2 is blocking the door, then I can't go to the door. Wait, the initial state doesn't mention any objects blocking doors. The problem statement says that objects may block doors, but in the initial state, is there any blocking? The original state lists objects in rooms but doesn't explicitly state any blocking. So maybe by default, objects are not blocking doors unless specified. But the preconditions for "goto door" include that there's no object blocking the position in front of d in the current room. So if in room_4, the door grey_door_1's front position is blocked by an object, then I can't go there. But the initial state has yellow_box_2 in room_4. If the yellow_box_2 is in front of the grey_door_1, then that would block it. But the initial state doesn't specify positions of objects relative to doors. Hmm, this is a problem. The problem description doesn't mention any objects blocking doors initially, so perhaps none are blocked. Therefore, I can assume that the grey_door_1 in room_4 is not blocked by any object, so I can go to it.

So the steps would be:

1. From room_4, go to the grey_door_1 (gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_2)
2. Toggle grey_door_1 to unlock it.
3. Use the door to go to room_2 (gotoroom room_4 room_2 grey_door_1)
4. Once in room_2, go to red_box_1 (gotoobject red_box_1 room_2)
5. Then, the goal is achieved: red_box_1 is red, in room_2, I'm in room_2, and in front of it.

But wait, the problem says "there is a box v such that the conditions are met". The red_box_1 is already in room_2. So maybe I just need to get to room_2 and be in front of it. So the plan would be:

- Gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_2 (precondition: in room_4, door connects to room_2, no object blocking)
- Toggle grey_door_1 (unlocks it)
- Gotoroom room_4 room_2 grey_door_1
- Gotoobject red_box_1 room_2

That's four actions. But wait, when you do gotoroom, you leave the front of the door. Then, in room_2, you need to go to the object. Are there any constraints that prevent this? The constraints are: cannot pick up or drop any ball, cannot use green_door_1, cannot toggle any door unless necessary. In this plan, only grey_door_1 is toggled once, which is necessary. No balls are involved, so it's okay.

But wait, after toggling grey_door_1, it's unlocked. Then using gotoroom to move from room_4 to room_2 via grey_door_1. Then in room_2, gotoobject red_box_1. But is red_box_1 in room_2? Yes, according to initial state. So this should work.

But let's check the preconditions step by step.

Initial state: in room_4, not holding anything. All doors locked.

Action 1: gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_2. Preconditions: I'm in a room connected by grey_door_1 (room_4 is connected to room_2 via grey_door_1). Also, no object blocking the position in front of grey_door_1 in room_4. Assuming no blocking, this is possible. After this, I'm in front of grey_door_1.

Action 2: toggle grey_door_1. Precondition: in front of it. So toggle unlocks it.

Action 3: gotoroom room_4 room_2 grey_door_1. Preconditions: current room is room_4, adjacent to room_2 (yes), door is unlocked (now it is). So can move to room_2. Now in room_2, not in front of any object.

Action 4: gotoobject red_box_1 room_2. Precondition: in same room as red_box_1 (yes, room_2). So this works. Now in front of red_box_1, which is red, in room_2. So the goal is achieved.

This plan has 4 actions. Are there any shorter plans? Let's think. Is there a way to get to room_2 with fewer actions? Let's see. The steps are necessary: you need to go to the door, unlock it, move through, then go to the box. That's four steps. I don't think it's possible to do it in fewer steps. For example, if the door was already unlocked, you could go directly, but it's initially locked. So this seems optimal.

Now check constraints: no balls are picked or dropped, green_door_1 isn't used, and only the necessary door (grey_door_1) is toggled once. So all constraints are satisfied.
