Let me analyze this planning problem step by step.

**Initial State:**
- I am in room_4.
- There's a yellow box (yellow_box_2) in room_4.
- In room_1, there's a blue box (blue_box_1) and a green box (green_box_1).
- In room_2, there's a yellow box (yellow_box_1) and a red box (red_box_1).
- In room_3, there's a purple box (purple_box_1), a red ball (red_ball_1), and another red ball (red_ball_2).
- All doors (yellow_door_1, red_door_1, grey_door_1, green_door_1) are locked.
- I'm not holding any object.

**Goal:**
I need to:
1. Be in room_2
2. Be in front of a red box
3. The red box needs to be in room_2

Looking at the initial state, there is already a red box (red_box_1) in room_2. So, I don't need to move any box. I just need to:
1. Get from room_4 to room_2
2. Go in front of the red box in room_2

To get from room_4 to room_2, I need to:
1. Go to the door connecting room_4 and room_2 (grey_door_1)
2. Unlock the door
3. Go through the door to room_2

Then, once in room_2, I need to go in front of the red box (red_box_1).

Let's plan the sequence of actions:

1. `gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_2` - Go to the grey door connecting room_4 and room_2.
2. `toggle grey_door_1` - Unlock the grey door.
3. `gotoroom room_4 room_2 grey_door_1` - Go from room_4 to room_2 through the grey door.
4. `gotoobject red_box_1 room_2` - Go in front of the red box in room_2.

Let me check if this plan meets all the constraints:

- We are initially in room_4.
- We go to the door connecting room_4 and room_2 (grey_door_1).
- We toggle the door to unlock it.
- We go through the door to room_2.
- We go in front of the red box (red_box_1) in room_2.

After executing this plan, we will be in room_2 and in front of the red box, which is already in room_2. This matches the goal state.

But let me check if there are any preconditions we might have missed:

For "gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_2":
- We need to be in room_4, which we are initially.
- The door shouldn't be blocked by an object, which it doesn't seem to be.

For "toggle grey_door_1":
- We need to be in front of the door, which we will be after the first action.

For "gotoroom room_4 room_2 grey_door_1":
- We need to be in room_4, which we are.
- The door connecting room_4 and room_2 should be unlocked, which it will be after the second action.

For "gotoobject red_box_1 room_2":
- We need to be in the same room as the object, which we will be after the third action.

It seems like all preconditions are met. This plan should be valid and optimal since it directly achieves the goal with a minimal number of actions.

Hmm, actually, now that I think about it, let me recheck the goal condition:

"There is a box v such that "The following conditions are all true: "v is red", "v is in room_2", "you are in room_2", "you are in front of v""

The goal is to find a red box in room_2 and be in front of it.

Looking at the initial state:
- In room_2, there's a yellow box (yellow_box_1) and a red box (red_box_1).

So, the red box we're looking for is red_box_1 which is already in room_2.

Our plan is:
1. `gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_2` - Go to the grey door connecting room_4 and room_2.
2. `toggle grey_door_1` - Unlock the grey door.
3. `gotoroom room_4 room_2 grey_door_1` - Go from room_4 to room_2 through the grey door.
4. `gotoobject red_box_1 room_2` - Go in front of the red box in room_2.

This plan should satisfy the goal.

Actually, wait, I need to double check if we can even toggle the door. Looking at the preconditions for "toggle":

"toggle": you may only toggle a door d if you are in front of d.

So we need to be in front of the door to toggle it. Let's revise the plan:

1. `gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_2` - Go to the grey door connecting room_4 and room_2.
2. `toggle grey_door_1` - Unlock the grey door (now that we're in front of it).
3. `gotoroom room_4 room_2 grey_door_1` - Go from room_4 to room_2 through the grey door.
4. `gotoobject red_box_1 room_2` - Go in front of the red box in room_2.

Let me double check the plan one more time:

For the first action "gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_2":
Precondition: we are in room_4 (which is true in the initial state), and door is connecting room_4 with another room (which is room_2, true in the initial state), and there is no object blocking the position in front of the door (seems to be true in the initial state).
Effect: we are in front of the grey door connecting room_4 and room_2.

For the second action "toggle grey_door_1":
Precondition: we are in front of grey_door_1 (which is true after the first action).
Effect: grey_door_1 is unlocked (because it was locked in the initial state).

For the third action "gotoroom room_4 room_2 grey_door_1":
Precondition: we are in room_4 (true), room_4 is adjacent to room_2 (true), and grey_door_1 is unlocked (true after the second action).
Effect: we are no longer in room_4, we are in room_2, we have visited room_2, and we are no longer in front of grey_door_1.

For the fourth action "gotoobject red_box_1 room_2":
Precondition: we are in room_2 (true after the third action), red_box_1 is in room_2 (true in the initial state).
Effect: we are in front of red_box_1.

After these actions, the goal is satisfied because:
- There is a box v (red_box_1) such that v is red, v is in room_2, we are in room_2, and we are in front of v.

This plan is valid and optimal since it uses the minimum number of actions to achieve the goal, given the constraints.

Actually, one more thing to check: we need to make sure that red_box_1 is really a box (and not a ball). Given the naming "red_box_1", it should be a box, but let's double-check in the objects list:

"box red_box_1"

Indeed, red_box_1 is a box, not a ball. So our plan is still valid.

Let me summarize the final plan:

1. `gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_2` - Go to the grey door connecting room_4 and room_2.
2. `toggle grey_door_1` - Unlock the grey door.
3. `gotoroom room_4 room_2 grey_door_1` - Go from room_4 to room_2 through the grey door.
4. `gotoobject red_box_1 room_2` - Go in front of the red box in room_2.

This plan achieves the goal: be in room_2 and in front of a red box.
