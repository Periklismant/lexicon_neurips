Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. The goal is to get a red box in room_2, be in room_2, and be in front of it. The initial state has me in room_4. Let's look at the boxes. There's red_box_1 in room_2. So that's the target. So the final goal is to be in room_2, in front of red_box_1. But there are a bunch of constraints to satisfy along the way.

First, let's list all the constraints. There are several that must be met at some point, and some conditional ones. Let's go through them one by one.

1. Must hold some object at least once.
2. grey_door_1 must be locked in at least one state.
3. If grey_door_1 is locked in state s, then after s (or in s), either green_door_1 is unlocked or I'm in front of yellow_door_1.
4. grey_door_1 must be unlocked in at least one state.
5. If grey_door_1 is unlocked in a state, there must be an earlier state where I was in room_3 or holding yellow_box_1.
6. Must be in room_3 holding green_box_1 at some point.
7. Must be in front of red_box_1 (which is part of the goal, but maybe another occurrence?).
8. If in front of red_box_1, there was a prior state where I was in front of empty.
9. Must hold either red_box_1 or green_box_1 at some point.
10. Must hold some object while purple_box_1 is in room_4.
11. Must be in front of grey_door_1.
12. If in front of grey_door_1, then in that state or later, red_ball_1 is in room_1 or grey_door_1 is locked.
13. Must be in room_4 (already true initially, but maybe again? The initial state says "you have visited room_4" so maybe the constraint is already satisfied, but perhaps needs to be there again later. Wait, the initial state says "you are in room_4" and "you have visited room_4". The constraint is that "you are in room_4" must hold in some state. Since the initial state has that, maybe that's already satisfied. But need to check if the plan requires moving back to room_4 again. Wait, the constraint says "The following expression must hold in at least one state: "you are in room_4"". Since the initial state is room_4, as long as the plan doesn't require being in room_4 again, that's already covered. But maybe during the plan, the agent leaves room_4 and comes back. Need to confirm.

14. If in room_4 in some state s, then in s or later, must be in room_1. Since the initial state is room_4, then this constraint requires that at some point after the start, the agent is in room_1. So even if the initial state is room_4, the agent must later go to room_1.

15. Must be in front of yellow_box_1 or holding some object at some point.

Also, the plan must be optimal (shortest possible). Let's outline the steps needed.

Starting in room_4. The goal is room_2 with red_box_1. So need to get to room_2, be in front of red_box_1. But room_2 is connected to room_4 via grey_door_1, which is locked. Also, the doors are initially all locked. So first, I need to unlock doors to move around.

The doors are yellow_door_1 (room_1-room_2), red_door_1 (room_1-room_3), grey_door_1 (room_2-room_4), green_door_1 (room_3-room_4). All locked.

So from room_4, the adjacent rooms are room_2 (via grey_door_1) and room_3 (via green_door_1). Both doors are locked. So to get out of room_4, I need to unlock either grey_door_1 or green_door_1. But to toggle a door, I need to be in front of it. So first, go to the door, then toggle it.

But to go to a door, I need to be in a room connected by that door. Since I'm in room_4, I can go to grey_door_1 (connecting room_4 and room_2) or green_door_1 (connecting room_4 and room_3). But both doors are blocked if there's an object in front. Wait, the preconditions for "gotodoor" are: (i) in a room connected by the door, and (ii) no object blocking the position in front of the door in the current room.

Looking at the initial objects in room_4: yellow_box_2 is in room_4. So if the door's front position is blocked by an object, then I can't go to the door. So where are the objects in each room?

Initial objects:

room_1: blue_box_1, green_box_1.

room_2: yellow_box_1, red_box_1.

room_3: purple_box_1, red_ball_1, red_ball_2.

room_4: yellow_box_2.

Assuming that the doors are positioned in each room. For example, in room_4, grey_door_1 connects to room_2. So to go to grey_door_1 from room_4, the position in front of the door in room_4 must not be blocked. But if yellow_box_2 is blocking that position, then gotodoor is not possible. Wait, but how do objects block doors? The problem says that an object blocks a door if it's in front of the door. So in room_4, the grey_door_1's front position is where? Maybe the doors are at specific positions, and if an object is in front (i.e., in the same position as the door's front), then it's blocked. But the initial state doesn't mention any door being blocked. Wait, the initial state doesn't state any door being blocked. So maybe none of the doors are blocked by objects initially. The only objects in room_4 is yellow_box_2. Unless the yellow_box_2 is in front of a door, then it's blocking. But the initial state doesn't mention that. So perhaps, by default, the doors are not blocked unless an object is placed in front. Since the problem's initial state doesn't mention any blocking, we can assume that all doors are not blocked, so we can go to them.

So, from room_4, I can go to grey_door_1 (connecting room_4 and room_2). So:

1. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_2

But wait, the action is "gotodoor d r1 r2", where r1 is the current room. Since I'm in room_4, grey_door_1 connects room_4 and room_2. So the correct command would be gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_2. Then, toggle the door to unlock it. Then go through to room_2.

Wait, but the grey_door_1 is locked. So to get to room_2, I need to unlock grey_door_1. But to unlock it, I need to be in front of it. So steps:

- goto grey_door_1 from room_4.

- toggle grey_door_1 (unlocks it).

- gotoroom room_4 room_2 grey_door_1.

But in room_2, there's red_box_1. So then, once in room_2, go to red_box_1 and be in front of it.

But the constraints complicate things. Let's check all constraints.

First constraint: must hold some object at least once. So at some point, pick up something.

Second constraint: grey_door_1 must be locked in at least one state. Initially, it's locked, so if we unlock it, then later lock it again, that would satisfy the constraint. But maybe the initial state already counts. Wait, the initial state is part of the plan's states. So the first state (initial) has grey_door_1 locked, so that satisfies the "must hold in at least one state". But if during the plan, we unlock it and don't lock it again, then the constraint is still satisfied because the initial state is included. However, the problem says "provided a planning problem, consisting of an initial state...". The plan starts from the initial state, so the initial state is part of the state sequence. So the initial locked state of grey_door_1 counts for constraint 2. So constraint 2 is already satisfied. But we need to check if any action in the plan changes that. For example, if the plan toggles grey_door_1 to unlock it, but then later toggles it again to lock it. But the constraint is that in at least one state, grey_door_1 is locked. Since the initial state is already locked, that's covered. So no need to lock it again. So constraint 2 is already satisfied by the initial state. However, if the plan requires that during the execution, grey_door_1 is locked again, then maybe, but according to the constraints, it's sufficient that it was locked in the initial state. So maybe constraint 2 is already satisfied, but the problem might require that during the plan execution, it's locked again. Wait, the constraints are part of the problem, so the user's problem includes these constraints. The user's problem says that the plan must satisfy all constraints. So even if the initial state satisfies some of them, the plan must not violate any constraints. For example, constraint 3: if in some state s, grey_door_1 is locked, then in s or later, either green_door_1 is unlocked or you are in front of yellow_door_1. The initial state has grey_door_1 locked, so constraint 3 must hold for that state. In the initial state, green_door_1 is locked, so the condition is "green_door_1 is not locked" (unlocked) or in front of yellow_door_1. Since in the initial state, you are in room_4, which is connected to room_3 via green_door_1. To be in front of yellow_door_1, which connects room_1 and room_2, you would need to be in room_1 or room_2. Since you start in room_4, you can't be in front of yellow_door_1 in the initial state. So in the initial state, the constraint 3 is violated unless the plan ensures that after the initial state, either green_door_1 is unlocked or you are in front of yellow_door_1. But the initial state s is part of the plan's states. So the initial state s (before any actions) has grey_door_1 locked, and in that state, neither green_door_1 is unlocked (it's locked) nor are you in front of yellow_door_1. So the constraint would require that in s or a later state, either green_door_1 is unlocked or you are in front of yellow_door_1. So even though the initial state has grey_door_1 locked, the plan must ensure that after the initial state (since during the plan execution, the initial state is the starting point), there is a state where either green_door_1 is unlocked or you are in front of yellow_door_1. So the plan must include unlocking green_door_1 or moving to front of yellow_door_1 at some point after the initial state. Because the initial state itself is part of the states, and the constraint is that if in a state s (which could be the initial state), then in s or a subsequent state, the condition holds. So in this case, the initial state s has grey_door_1 locked, so the plan must ensure that either in s (initial) or after s, green_door_1 is unlocked or you are in front of yellow_door_1. Since in the initial state, green_door_1 is locked, and you're not in front of yellow_door_1, the plan must have an action that makes one of these conditions true at some point. So perhaps unlocking green_door_1 later.

This complicates things. So even though constraint 2 is satisfied by the initial state, constraint 3 requires that after the initial state, we unlock green_door_1 or get in front of yellow_door_1.

Similarly, other constraints need to be considered.

So, let's outline the steps required to achieve the goal while satisfying all constraints.

The goal is to be in room_2, in front of red_box_1, which is already in room_2. So steps:

1. Unlock grey_door_1 (room_4 to room_2) to get to room_2.

But to unlock grey_door_1, need to be in front of it. So:

- gotoempty (since in room_4, can go to empty spot, but maybe need to go to the door first).

Wait, no. The action "gotodoor" requires that you are in a room connected by the door, and no object is blocking the position in front of the door. In room_4, grey_door_1 connects room_4 and room_2. So:

Action: gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_2.

Then toggle to unlock it.

Then, gotoroom room_4 room_2 grey_door_1.

Once in room_2, gotoobject red_box_1 room_2.

But that would be the basic plan. However, the constraints must be satisfied.

Now, let's check each constraint.

Constraint 1: Hold some object. So need to pick up something.

Constraint 6: Be in room_3 holding green_box_1. Green_box_1 is in room_1. So need to go to room_1, get green_box_1, and take it to room_3.

But how to get to room_1 from room_2? The doors between room_1 and room_2 are yellow_door_1, which is locked. So need to unlock yellow_door_1. But to unlock it, need to be in front of it. So from room_2, gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_1, toggle it, then go to room_1.

But this seems like a lot. Also, other constraints must be met.

Constraint 5: If grey_door_1 is unlocked (which we need to do to get to room_2), then there must be an earlier state where you were in room_3 or holding yellow_box_1. So unlocking grey_door_1 requires that before that, you were in room_3 or holding yellow_box_1. Wait, the constraint is that if in some state s, grey_door_1 is unlocked, then there exists an earlier state where you were in room_3 or holding yellow_box_1.

Wait, the constraint says: If grey_door_1 is not locked in some state, then there must be an earlier state where you were in room_3 or holding yellow_box_1.

Wait, the fifth constraint is: If "grey_door_1 is not locked" holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state where "you are in room_3" or "you are holding yellow_box_1".

So when you unlock grey_door_1 (changing it from locked to unlocked), that's a state where grey_door_1 is not locked. So after that action, you need to have previously been in room_3 or held yellow_box_1.

But initially, you are in room_4. So, to unlock grey_door_1 (to go to room_2), you need to have been in room_3 or held yellow_box_1 before that. But how? Because you start in room_4. To get to room_3, you need to go through green_door_1, which is locked. So to unlock green_door_1, you need to be in front of it. So:

From room_4, gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3, toggle to unlock, then go to room_3. Once in room_3, you can meet the condition of being in room_3. Then go back to room_4, unlock grey_door_1, then go to room_2. But this adds steps. But maybe necessary to satisfy constraint 5.

Alternatively, pick up yellow_box_1. yellow_box_1 is in room_2. But to get to room_2, you need to unlock grey_door_1, which requires going through constraint 5. So it's a catch-22.

Wait, this seems like a problem. Let's think again.

If I need to unlock grey_door_1 (to get to room_2), then when I do that, the state after toggling has grey_door_1 unlocked. According to constraint 5, there must have been a prior state where I was in room_3 or holding yellow_box_1. But before unlocking grey_door_1, how can I have been in room_3? Because to get to room_3 from room_4, green_door_1 is locked. So need to unlock green_door_1 first. But to unlock green_door_1, need to be in front of it in room_4.

So steps:

1. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3 (precondition: in room_4, door connects to room_3; no object blocking front. Since yellow_box_2 is in room_4, but not blocking the door, assuming it's not in front of the door. So this action is possible.

2. toggle green_door_1 (unlock it).

3. gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1 (now in room_3).

Now, being in room_3 satisfies the condition for constraint 5. Then, after that, go back to room_4, unlock grey_door_1, then go to room_2.

But this adds steps, but is necessary to satisfy constraint 5.

But this also helps with constraint 6: "you are in room_3 holding green_box_1". So after getting to room_3, maybe pick up green_box_1. But green_box_1 is in room_1. So to get green_box_1 to room_3, need to go to room_1 first.

Wait, green_box_1 is in room_1. To get to room_1, from room_3, the connecting door is red_door_1 (room_1-room_3), which is locked. So need to unlock red_door_1. But to unlock red_door_1, need to be in front of it from room_3.

So:

From room_3, gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1.

Toggle red_door_1 (unlock).

Gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1.

Then, in room_1, pick up green_box_1.

Then return to room_3, drop it? But the constraint is to be in room_3 holding green_box_1. So pick up green_box_1 in room_1, then go back to room_3 while holding it.

But this is getting complicated. Let's see.

So, the constraints require:

- At least once, be in room_3 holding green_box_1.

So, steps to achieve that:

From room_3, go to room_1 via red_door_1 (after unlocking it), pick up green_box_1, return to room_3.

But then, after that, we can proceed to unlock grey_door_1, which requires having been in room_3 (which was done), thus satisfying constraint 5.

But this is a lot of steps. Let's try to map out the plan step by step, considering all constraints.

Let me outline a possible plan:

1. Start in room_4.

Constraints:

- Constraint 13: "you are in room_4" is already satisfied in the initial state.

- Constraint 14: If in room_4 (which is true initially), then in that state or after, must be in room_1. So the plan must eventually reach room_1.

So the agent must go to room_1 at some point.

Now, the plan must include:

- Unlock green_door_1 to get to room_3.

- Unlock red_door_1 to get to room_1.

- Unlock grey_door_1 to get to room_2.

But let's proceed step by step.

Possible steps:

1. In room_4: gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3.

2. toggle green_door_1 (unlock).

3. gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1 (now in room_3).

Now in room_3. This helps with constraint 5 when later unlocking grey_door_1.

4. gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1.

5. toggle red_door_1 (unlock).

6. gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1 (now in room_1).

7. gotoobject green_box_1 room_1.

8. pick green_box_1 room_1. (Now holding green_box_1, which satisfies constraint 8 and 9.)

Constraint 6: must be in room_3 holding green_box_1. So need to return to room_3 with it.

9. gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1.

Now in room_3 holding green_box_1. This satisfies constraint 6.

10. drop green_box_1 room_3. (But do we need to? Or just holding it is enough. The constraint is that the agent is in room_3 and holding green_box_1, so dropping it would end that state. So step 9: in room_3 holding green_box_1. Then, after that, the agent can drop it if needed.)

But other constraints: constraint 10 requires that there's a state where you are holding some object and purple_box_1 is in room_4. Purple_box_1 is initially in room_3. So to have purple_box_1 in room_4, you need to move it there. But the agent is holding green_box_1. To move purple_box_1, you need to pick it up. So perhaps after step 9, drop green_box_1 in room_3, then pick up purple_box_1.

But this is getting too long. Let's see.

Constraint 10: Must be holding some object while purple_box_1 is in room_4. So during the plan, purple_box_1 needs to be moved to room_4, and during that time or after, the agent must hold some object. But purple_box_1 is initially in room_3. So to get it to room_4, the agent must pick it up in room_3, carry it to room_4.

But to do that:

From room_3, pick up purple_box_1 (requires being in room_3 and not holding anything. But after step 9, the agent is holding green_box_1. So need to drop green_box_1 first.

So steps after step 9:

10. drop green_box_1 room_3. (Now empty hands.)

11. gotoobject purple_box_1 room_3.

12. pick purple_box_1 room_3.

13. gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_1. (Need to unlock green_door_1 again? Wait, in step 2, we unlocked green_door_1. So assuming it's still unlocked.)

But when you go from room_3 to room_4 via green_door_1, if the door is unlocked, it's possible.

14. drop purple_box_1 room_4. (Now purple_box_1 is in room_4. But the constraint requires that there is a state where you are holding some object and purple_box_1 is in room_4. So if you drop it in room_4, then after dropping, purple_box_1 is there, but you're not holding it. So the constraint requires that during the time you are holding some object (like when you're carrying purple_box_1 to room_4), and purple_box_1 is in room_4 (which is after you drop it). Wait, no. The state where you are holding the object and purple_box_1 is in room_4 can only happen if you are holding it while in room_4. Because when you drop it, purple_box_1 is in room_4, but you're no longer holding it. So perhaps the correct way is to carry purple_box_1 to room_4, and while holding it in room_4, that satisfies the constraint. Because in that state, you are holding purple_box_1 (so some object) and purple_box_1 is in room_4 (since you are in room_4 and holding it, but technically, when you are holding it, it's not in any room. Wait, according to the effects of "pick": after picking, the object is no longer in the room. So when you pick up purple_box_1 in room_3, it's no longer in room_3. When you drop it in room_4, it's placed there. So the constraint requires that in some state, you are holding some object and purple_box_1 is in room_4. But when you're holding it, it's not in any room. So the only way this can be true is if you drop it in room_4 and then pick up another object while purple_box_1 is in room_4. For example, after dropping purple_box_1 in room_4, you pick up yellow_box_2 (in room_4), then you are holding it while purple_box_1 is in room_4. So that would satisfy constraint 10.

This adds more steps. So after step 14 (dropping purple_box_1 in room_4):

15. gotoobject yellow_box_2 room_4.

16. pick yellow_box_2 room_4. (Now holding yellow_box_2, and purple_box_1 is in room_4. So this state satisfies constraint 10.)

But this is adding many steps. However, the plan must be optimal (shortest possible). So perhaps there's a more efficient way.

Alternatively, after moving purple_box_1 to room_4 (step 14), when you drop it, you are no longer holding it, but purple_box_1 is in room_4. Then, you can pick up yellow_box_2 in room_4, which is still there. So:

14. drop purple_box_1 room_4.

15. gotoobject yellow_box_2 room_4.

16. pick yellow_box_2 room_4.

Now, in this state, you are holding yellow_box_2 and purple_box_1 is in room_4. So constraint 10 is satisfied.

But this is a lot of steps. Is there a shorter way? Let's think.

Alternatively, after step 13 (carrying purple_box_1 to room_4), while holding it, you are in room_4. But purple_box_1 is not in room_4 yet (it's in your hands). So you need to drop it, then pick up something else while it's in room_4. So steps:

13. gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_1 (carrying purple_box_1).

14. drop purple_box_1 room_4.

15. pick yellow_box_2 room_4.

Now, when you pick yellow_box_2, you are holding it, and purple_box_1 is in room_4. So this satisfies constraint 10.

But this requires steps 13-15.

Moving on. Now, after this, the agent needs to get to room_2.

But to get to room_2, need to go through grey_door_1 from room_4. But grey_door_1 is initially locked. So need to unlock it. But constraint 5 requires that before unlocking grey_door_1, the agent was in room_3 or holding yellow_box_1.

In the current plan, the agent was in room_3 (step 3) and also has held yellow_box_2 (step 15). Wait, but yellow_box_1 is in room_2. The agent is holding yellow_box_2, which is a different box. So constraint 5 requires being in room_3 or holding yellow_box_1. Holding yellow_box_2 doesn't count. So in the current plan, when the agent toggles grey_door_1 to unlock it, they need to have previously been in room_3. Which they were in step 3. So that's okay.

So next steps:

17. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_2.

18. toggle grey_door_1 (unlock it).

19. gotoroom room_4 room_2 grey_door_1 (now in room_2).

Constraint 5 is satisfied because step 3 (being in room_3) occurred before step 18 (unlocking grey_door_1).

Now in room_2. Need to be in front of red_box_1. So:

20. gotoobject red_box_1 room_2.

But constraint 8 says that if in front of red_box_1, there must have been a prior state where you were in front of empty. So before step 20, the agent needs to have been in front of empty. The agent was in front of empty when they did gotoempty, or after dropping an object. Let's check the current steps.

After step 16 (picking yellow_box_2), the agent is in front of yellow_box_2. Then steps 17-20: goto grey_door_1, toggle, goto room_2, then goto red_box_1. So between step 16 and 20, the agent was in front of grey_door_1 (step 17), then toggled it, then went to room_2. In room_2, the agent is not in front of any object until step 20. But when you enter a room using gotoroom, you are no longer in front of anything. So in room_2, before step 20, the agent is not in front of any object. So to go to red_box_1, they use gotoobject, but before that, they might need to go to an empty position. So perhaps after entering room_2, they need to gotoempty first to satisfy constraint 8. Because when you enter a room via gotoroom, you are not in front of any object. Then, gotoempty would make you in front of empty. Then gotoobject red_box_1. So:

19. gotoroom room_4 room_2 grey_door_1.

20. gotoempty.

21. gotoobject red_box_1 room_2.

Now, step 20 (gotoempty) satisfies the precondition for constraint 8: before being in front of red_box_1 (step 21), you were in front of empty (step 20).

But wait, the constraint says: If in front of red_box_1 in some state, there must be an earlier state where you were in front of empty. So step 21 (in front of red_box_1) must have a prior state where you were in front of empty. Step 20 is before 21, so that's satisfied.

Now, the goal is to be in room_2, in front of red_box_1. Step 21 achieves that. But the agent may need to drop the object they are holding (yellow_box_2) to be free to pick up red_box_1. Wait, no. The goal is to have a red box in room_2, which is already there. The agent just needs to be in front of it. So even if holding another box, it's okay. But the actions require that to pick up red_box_1, the agent must not be holding anything. But the goal doesn't require holding the box, just being in front of it.

So the current state after step 21 is: in room_2, in front of red_box_1, holding yellow_box_2. The goal is satisfied. But also need to ensure that all constraints are met.

Let's check each constraint:

1. Hold some object: satisfied in steps 8 (green_box_1), 12 (purple_box_1), 15 (yellow_box_2), etc.

2. grey_door_1 is locked: initially true. In step 18, it's unlocked. Unless we lock it again, but the constraint is that it's locked in at least one state, which is already true in the initial state.

3. For any state where grey_door_1 is locked (including initial), in that state or after, green_door_1 is not locked or in front of yellow_door_1. In the initial state, green_door_1 is locked, so the condition requires that after the initial state, either green_door_1 is unlocked or you are in front of yellow_door_1. In step 2, green_door_1 is unlocked. So after step 2, green_door_1 is unlocked. So the condition is satisfied for the initial state (s=initial) because in a later state (step 2), green_door_1 is unlocked.

4. grey_door_1 must be not locked in at least one state: step 18 onwards, it's unlocked, so satisfied.

5. For any state where grey_door_1 is unlocked (step 18 onwards), there's an earlier state where in room_3 or holding yellow_box_1. Step 3 (being in room_3) satisfies this.

6. Must be in room_3 holding green_box_1: step 9 (gotoroom room_1 to room_3 while holding green_box_1), then step 9 is in room_3 holding green_box_1.

7. Must be in front of red_box_1: step 21.

8. If in front of red_box_1, prior state with front of empty: step 20.

9. Must hold red_box_1 or green_box_1 at some point: step 8 (green_box_1), step 12 (purple_box_1 doesn't count), step 15 (yellow_box_2 doesn't count). So step 8 satisfies this.

10. Hold some object while purple_box_1 is in room_4: step 15 (holding yellow_box_2 after dropping purple_box_1 in room_4). Or step 14 (purple_box_1 is dropped in room_4) and step 15 (picking yellow_box_2). So during step 15, when holding yellow_box_2, purple_box_1 is in room_4. So satisfied.

11. Must be in front of grey_door_1: step 17.

12. If in front of grey_door_1 (step 17), then in that state or after, grey_door_1 is locked or red_ball_1 is in room_1. In step 17, after that, step 18 toggles grey_door_1 to unlocked, so grey_door_1 is not locked. red_ball_1 is initially in room_3. To satisfy the condition, either grey_door_1 is locked in that state or after, or red_ball_1 is in room_1. But after step 17, grey_door_1 is locked until step 18. So in step 17, grey_door_1 is locked. So during step 17, the condition is satisfied because grey_door_1 is locked. So the constraint is met.

13. Be in room_4: initial state and steps after returning there.

14. If in room_4 (step 0 and steps 13-16), then must be in room_1 at some point. Steps 6-8: agent goes to room_1. So satisfied.

15. Must be in front of yellow_box_1 or holding some object. yellow_box_1 is in room_2. The agent goes to room_2 in step 19. So in room_2, they can go to yellow_box_1. But in the current plan, they go to red_box_1. But constraint 15 is satisfied multiple times when holding objects (steps 8, 12, 15, etc.), so this is covered.

This seems to cover all constraints.

But let's count the steps to see if this is optimal.

The steps outlined are:

1. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3

2. toggle green_door_1

3. gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1

4. gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1

5. toggle red_door_1

6. gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1

7. gotoobject green_box_1 room_1

8. pick green_box_1 room_1

9. gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1

10. gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4

11. toggle green_door_1 (lock it again? Wait, no, need to go back to room_4.)

Wait, no. After step 9, the agent is in room_3 holding green_box_1. Then, to go back to room_4, they need to use green_door_1 (already unlocked in step 2). So:

10. gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4

11. gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_1

12. drop green_box_1 room_4

13. gotoobject purple_box_1 room_3 → Wait, no. After step 9, the agent is in room_3. Oh no, in step 9, the agent was in room_1, then gotoroom to room_3, which is correct. So after step 9, they are in room_3 holding green_box_1. Then, need to go back to room_4 to get purple_box_1 to room_4.

But purple_box_1 is in room_3. So steps after step 9:

10. drop green_box_1 room_3

11. gotoobject purple_box_1 room_3

12. pick purple_box_1 room_3

13. gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_1

14. drop purple_box_1 room_4

15. gotoobject yellow_box_2 room_4

16. pick yellow_box_2 room_4

17. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_2

18. toggle grey_door_1

19. gotoroom room_4 room_2 grey_door_1

20. gotoempty

21. gotoobject red_box_1 room_2

That's 21 steps. But maybe there's a shorter way.

Wait, perhaps after step 9 (in room_3 holding green_box_1), instead of dropping it, the agent can proceed to carry it to room_4. But the constraint requires that purple_box_1 is in room_4 while holding some object. So perhaps:

After step 9:

10. gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_1 (still holding green_box_1)

11. drop green_box_1 room_4

12. gotoobject purple_box_1 room_3 → but agent is in room_4 now. Can't do that. So need to go back to room_3.

This complicates things.

Alternatively, after step 9 (room_3 holding green_box_1), the agent can pick up purple_box_1 in room_3. But to pick up purple_box_1, need to drop green_box_1 first.

So:

10. drop green_box_1 room_3

11. gotoobject purple_box_1 room_3

12. pick purple_box_1 room_3

13. gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_1

14. drop purple_box_1 room_4

15. gotoobject yellow_box_2 room_4

16. pick yellow_box_2 room_4

Then proceed to unlock grey_door_1.

But this adds steps. However, this ensures that when the agent is holding yellow_box_2 (step 16), purple_box_1 is in room_4 (step 14). So constraint 10 is satisfied.

Then:

17. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_2

18. toggle grey_door_1

19. gotoroom room_4 room_2 grey_door_1

20. gotoempty

21. gotoobject red_box_1 room_2

That's 21 steps. Is there a shorter path?

Let me think differently. The goal is to be in room_2, in front of red_box_1. The red_box_1 is already there. So the minimal steps would be:

- Unlock grey_door_1.

- Go to room_2.

- Go to red_box_1.

But the constraints force additional steps.

For example, the need to be in room_3 holding green_box_1 requires a detour.

But perhaps there's a way to combine some steps.

Alternative plan:

1. From room_4, go to green_door_1, unlock it.

2. Go to room_3.

3. Go to red_door_1, unlock it.

4. Go to room_1, pick green_box_1.

5. Return to room_3 (now holding green_box_1: satisfies constraint 6).

6. Go to room_4, drop green_box_1.

7. Pick up purple_box_1 in room_3 (requires going back to room_3).

Wait, no. After step 5, agent is in room_3 holding green_box_1. Then, go to room_4 via green_door_1.

7. gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_1.

8. drop green_box_1 room_4.

9. gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1.

10. gotoobject purple_box_1 room_3.

11. pick purple_box_1 room_3.

12. gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_1.

13. drop purple_box_1 room_4.

14. pick yellow_box_2 room_4.

15. unlock grey_door_1 and go to room_2.

16. gotoempty then goto red_box_1.

This is still lengthy. However, the constraints make it impossible to have a shorter plan. Each constraint adds steps.

But maybe there's a smarter way to satisfy multiple constraints with fewer steps.

For example, when the agent is in room_3 holding green_box_1 (step 5), this satisfies constraint 6. Then, if they take green_box_1 to room_4 and drop it, then pick up yellow_box_2, that satisfies constraint 10 (holding yellow_box_2 while purple_box_1 is in room_4, but purple_box_1 is still in room_3. So that doesn't work. So purple_box_1 needs to be moved to room_4.

Thus, the steps to move purple_box_1 to room_4 are necessary.

Given all this, the optimal plan would have around 20 steps. But perhaps there's a way to optimize.

Wait, when the agent is in room_4 after step 13 (drop purple_box_1), they can pick up yellow_box_2 (step 14). Then, instead of toggling grey_door_1, can they proceed to room_2 via room_3 and room_1? No, because room_2 is connected to room_4 via grey_door_1 and to room_1 via yellow_door_1. But unlocking grey_door_1 is necessary.

Alternatively, maybe after unlocking grey_door_1, go to room_2, and then the goal is met.

But the constraints require multiple other steps.

After careful consideration, the plan I outlined earlier seems to cover all constraints but may not be optimal. Let's try to find a shorter path.

Alternative approach:

- Unlock grey_door_1 first to reach room_2 quickly. But to unlock grey_door_1, need to have been in room_3 or held yellow_box_1. Since yellow_box_1 is in room_2, which is locked behind grey_door_1, can't reach it. So must go to room_3 first.

Thus, the steps are unavoidable.

So the minimal plan would involve:

- Unlock green_door_1.

- Go to room_3.

- Unlock red_door_1.

- Go to room_1, pick green_box_1.

- Return to room_3 to satisfy constraint 6.

- Go back to room_4, move purple_box_1 there.

- Pick yellow_box_2 in room_4.

- Unlock grey_door_1.

- Go to room_2, gotoempty, then goto red_box_1.

This seems to be the necessary path. Now, let's write the steps in order, ensuring that each action's preconditions are met.

Final plan steps:

1. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3

2. toggle green_door_1

3. gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1

4. gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1

5. toggle red_door_1

6. gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1

7. gotoobject green_box_1 room_1

8. pick green_box_1 room_1

9. gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1

10. drop green_box_1 room_3

11. gotoobject purple_box_1 room_3

12. pick purple_box_1 room_3

13. gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_1

14. drop purple_box_1 room_4

15. gotoobject yellow_box_2 room_4

16. pick yellow_box_2 room_4

17. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_2

18. toggle grey_door_1

19. gotoroom room_4 room_2 grey_door_1

20. gotoempty

21. gotoobject red_box_1 room_2

This plan has 21 steps. Now, check if all constraints are met:

Constraint 1: Holding objects in steps 8, 12, 16.

Constraint 2: grey_door_1 locked in initial state.

Constraint 3: For initial state (grey_door_1 locked), after step 2, green_door_1 is unlocked.

Constraint 4: grey_door_1 unlocked in step 18.

Constraint 5: After step 18, grey_door_1 is unlocked. Earlier state step 3 (in room_3).

Constraint 6: Step 9: in room_3 holding green_box_1? No. Step 9 is gotoroom from room_1 to room_3, holding green_box_1. So yes.

Constraint 7: Step 21.

Constraint 8: Step 20 before 21.

Constraint 9: Step 8 (holding green_box_1).

Constraint 10: Step 16 (holding yellow_box_2) and step 14 (purple_box_1 in room_4).

Constraint 11: Step 17.

Constraint 12: Step 17 (front of grey_door_1), in that state, grey_door_1 is locked (before step 18 toggles it).

Constraint 13: Initial state.

Constraint 14: Step 6 (room_1) after initial room_4.

Constraint 15: Holding objects multiple times.

This seems to cover all constraints, but it's a long plan. Is there a way to optimize further?

For example, after step 8 (holding green_box_1), can the agent directly go to room_4 via room_3 and green_door_1 without dropping green_box_1?

Let me see:

After step 8, the agent is in room_1 holding green_box_1.

Step 9: gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1 (now in room_3).

Step 10: gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_1 (still holding green_box_1).

Step 11: drop green_box_1 room_4.

Now, purple_box_1 needs to be moved to room_4. So step 12: go back to room_3, pick purple_box_1, return to room_4.

But this adds steps but may save some.

Alternatively, after step 9 (room_3 holding green_box_1), go to room_4, drop green_box_1, then pick up purple_box_1 from room_3.

But this requires:

9. gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1.

10. gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_1.

11. drop green_box_1 room_4.

12. gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1.

13. gotoobject purple_box_1 room_3.

14. pick purple_box_1 room_3.

15. gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_1.

16. drop purple_box_1 room_4.

17. pick yellow_box_2 room_4.

This is more steps than before. So it's not better.

Alternatively, after step 9, drop green_box_1 in room_3, then pick up purple_box_1, take to room_4, then pick yellow_box_2. This is the original plan.

Alternatively, can we avoid moving purple_box_1? Because constraint 10 requires that there's a state where you are holding some object and purple_box_1 is in room_4. So if you can get purple_box_1 to room_4 without moving it, but that's impossible since it starts in room_3. So it must be moved.

Thus, the steps are unavoidable.

Given all this, the plan I outlined is necessary to meet all constraints. Therefore, the optimal plan is as follows:
