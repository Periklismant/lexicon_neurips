Alright, I need to solve a planning problem in a 2D gridworld. Let me make sure I understand the problem:

The goal is to have a blue box in room_4, be in room_4 myself, and be standing in front of the blue box.

From the original state:
- I am in room_3
- blue_box_1 is in room_4 (and it's blue)
- All doors are locked

So I need to go from room_3 to room_4, and then go to the blue box in room_4. Let's break down the steps:

1. First, I need to get to room_4 from room_3. To do that, I need to go through the grey_door_1 that connects these rooms.
2. But since grey_door_1 is locked, I need to go to the door and toggle it to unlock it.
3. Then, I can pass through the door to room_4.
4. Once in room_4, I can go to the blue box.

Now let's formulate the plan:

1. "gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4" - Go to the door connecting room_3 to room_4.
2. "toggle grey_door_1" - Unlock the door.
3. "gotoroom room_3 room_4 grey_door_1" - Go to room_4 from room_3 through the grey door.
4. "gotoobject blue_box_1 room_4" - Go to the blue box in room_4.

Let's check if this plan is valid according to the constraints and preconditions:

Action 1: "gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4"
Preconditions: 
- I am in room_3 (satisfied from the initial state)
- Grey_door_1 connects room_3 to another room (satisfied, it connects to room_4)
- No object is blocking the position in front of the door (no information about blocking in the initial state, so I assume it's not blocked)

Action 2: "toggle grey_door_1"
Preconditions:
- I am in front of grey_door_1 (satisfied after action 1)

Action 3: "gotoroom room_3 room_4 grey_door_1"
Preconditions:
- I am in room_3 (satisfied from the initial state)
- Room_3 is adjacent to room_4 (satisfied)
- The door connecting them (grey_door_1) is unlocked (satisfied after action 2)

Action 4: "gotoobject blue_box_1 room_4"
Preconditions:
- I am in room_4 (satisfied after action 3)
- blue_box_1 is in room_4 (satisfied from the initial state)

This plan seems valid and achieves the goal. Actually, let me make sure I understand the goal correctly:

"There is a box v such that "The following conditions are all true: "v is blue", "v is in room_4", "you are in room_4", "you are in front of v"""

This means:
1. The box is blue.
2. The box is in room_4.
3. I am in room_4.
4. I am in front of the box.

From my plan:
- blue_box_1 is blue (from initial state)
- blue_box_1 is in room_4 (from initial state)
- I will be in room_4 (after action 3)
- I will be in front of blue_box_1 (after action 4)

So, the plan works.

Actually, since blue_box_1 is already in room_4, the goal is quite straightforward. I think the optimal plan is indeed:

1. "gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4" - Go to the door connecting room_3 to room_4.
2. "toggle grey_door_1" - Unlock the door.
3. "gotoroom room_3 room_4 grey_door_1" - Go to room_4 from room_3 through the grey door.
4. "gotoobject blue_box_1 room_4" - Go to the blue box in room_4.

This plan seems optimal, as I am using the most direct path to achieve the goal.

Let me review it one more time:

Action 1: "gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4"
This action puts me in front of the grey door connecting room_3 to room_4.

Action 2: "toggle grey_door_1"
This action unlocks the grey door.

Action 3: "gotoroom room_3 room_4 grey_door_1"
This action moves me from room_3 to room_4 through the grey door.

Action 4: "gotoobject blue_box_1 room_4"
This action positions me in front of the blue box in room_4.

After executing these actions, the goal state will be achieved. This plan is valid and optimal.

So my final plan is:
```
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4
toggle grey_door_1
gotoroom room_3 room_4 grey_door_1
gotoobject blue_box_1 room_4
```

Alright, let's double check my initial understanding of the goal, goal state, and how to achieve it one more time to ensure I haven't missed anything.

Checking my goal definition:
"There is a box v such that "The following conditions are all true: "v is blue", "v is in room_4", "you are in room_4", "you are in front of v"""

I need:
1. A box in room_4 that's blue.
2. Me to be in room_4.
3. Me to be in front of the blue box.

From the initial state:
- I am in room_3.
- There's a blue box (blue_box_1) in room_4.
- All doors are locked.

I'm pretty confident that my plan is optimal to achieve the goal:
1. "gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4" - Go to the door connecting room_3 to room_4.
2. "toggle grey_door_1" - Unlock the door.
3. "gotoroom room_3 room_4 grey_door_1" - Go to room_4 from room_3 through the grey door.
4. "gotoobject blue_box_1 room_4" - Go to the blue box in room_4.

Given all of this, I believe my solution is correct and optimal.

```
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4
toggle grey_door_1
gotoroom room_3 room_4 grey_door_1
gotoobject blue_box_1 room_4
```
