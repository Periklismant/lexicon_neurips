Okay, let's tackle this planning problem step by step. The goal is to get a blue box into room_4, be in room_4, and be in front of that box. The constraints are a bit complex, so I need to make sure each one is satisfied. Let me start by understanding the initial state and the goal.

Initial State:
- You're in room_3.
- Blue_box_1 is in room_4. Wait, no, looking back, blue_box_1 is in room_4? Wait, the original state says "blue_box_1 is in room_4". So the blue box is already where it needs to be. The goal is to have a blue box (which is blue_box_1) in room_4, you in room_4, and in front of it. So maybe the main challenge is getting to room_4 and being in front of blue_box_1 there. But wait, room_4's doors are connected via green_door_1 (from room_2) and grey_door_1 (from room_3). But the constraints say that grey_door_1 must always be locked. So you can't use grey_door_1 to go from room_3 to room_4. So you have to go through another path. Let me check the connections.

Doors:
- yellow_door_1 connects room_1 and room_2.
- yellow_door_2 connects room_1 and room_3.
- green_door_1 connects room_2 and room_4.
- grey_door_1 connects room_3 and room_4.

All doors are initially locked. The constraints require that grey_door_1 is always locked, so we can't unlock it. Therefore, to get from room_3 to room_4, the only possible path is room_3 -> room_1 via yellow_door_2, then room_1 -> room_2 via yellow_door_1, then room_2 -> room_4 via green_door_1. But all these doors are locked initially. So the plan must involve unlocking some doors.

Constraints:
1. At least once, hold some object and specifically blue_box_1. So we need to pick up blue_box_1 at some point.
2. grey_door_1 must always be locked. So never toggle it.
3. At least once be in room_4. That's part of the goal.
4. If in room_4 in some state, must have held an object before that state.
5. At least once be in front of blue_box_1. Which is needed for the goal.
6. If in front of blue_box_1, must have been in room_2 before.
7. At least once hold green_ball_1.
8. At least once hold grey_box_1.
9. At least once be in room_1 or have yellow_door_2 unlocked.
10. At least once hold yellow_box_1 or have green_door_1 unlocked.
11. At least once have yellow_door_1 unlocked.
12. At least once be in room_3. Which is already true initially, but maybe need to revisit.
13. If in room_3 at any state, must hold red_box_1 at that state or later.

So the plan needs to satisfy all these. Let's outline the steps.

First, the main goal: be in room_4, in front of blue_box_1, which is already there. So maybe just go there. But doors are locked. So need to unlock doors.

Since grey_door_1 can't be toggled (must remain locked), the path to room_4 must be through room_1 and room_2. So from room_3, unlock yellow_door_2 (connects room_3 and room_1), go to room_1, then unlock yellow_door_1 (connects room_1 and room_2), go to room_2, unlock green_door_1 (connects room_2 and room_4), go to room_4. Then go in front of blue_box_1 and drop it (but it's already there). Wait, but the goal is just to have it there, so maybe just being in front is enough. Wait, the goal is "there is a box v such that v is blue, in room_4, you are in room_4, and in front of v". Since blue_box_1 is already in room_4, perhaps the steps are just getting to room_4 and in front of it. But the doors are locked.

But to unlock the doors, you need to toggle them. However, to toggle a door, you must be in front of it. To get in front of a door, you need to be in a room connected by that door and have no object blocking the door's position.

But the initial state doesn't mention any objects blocking doors. Wait, the preconditions for "gotodoor d r1 r2" require that there's no object blocking the position in front of the door in the current room. So if there's an object in front of the door, you can't go there. But in the initial state, are there any objects blocking doors? Let's see. The objects in room_1: red_box_1, grey_box_1, red_box_2. In room_3: grey_ball_1, blue_ball_1, yellow_box_1, green_ball_1. In room_4: blue_box_1. The doors' positions aren't specified as blocked, so perhaps they are not. So maybe possible to go to doors.

So steps:

1. From room_3, go to yellow_door_2 (since it connects room_3 and room_1). Then toggle it to unlock. Then go through to room_1. Then from room_1, go to yellow_door_1, unlock, go to room_2. Then go to green_door_1, unlock, go to room_4. Then go to blue_box_1 and be in front of it.

But along the way, we need to satisfy all constraints.

Constraints:

- Must hold blue_box_1 at least once. But blue_box_1 is in room_4. So perhaps after reaching room_4, pick it up and drop it again? But the goal just needs it to be in room_4, which it already is. Alternatively, maybe the problem is that the initial blue_box_1 is in room_4, so we just need to be in front of it. But then why the constraint to hold blue_box_1? Let me check the first constraint: "The following expression must hold in at least one state: you are holding some object, you are holding blue_box_1." So we need to hold blue_box_1 at least once. So in the plan, after reaching room_4, pick up blue_box_1, then drop it again (to satisfy the goal of being in front of it).

But also, other constraints:

- Must hold green_ball_1 at least once. Green_ball_1 is in room_3. So need to pick it up. But how? Since you start in room_3. So maybe before leaving room_3, pick up green_ball_1, then drop it somewhere. But when you pick up objects, they are removed from the room, but maybe that's okay as long as you hold them once.

Wait, but if you pick up green_ball_1 in room_3, you have to be in front of it. So steps in room_3: gotoobject green_ball_1 room_3, then pick it up. Then you're holding it, satisfying that constraint. Then drop it again in room_3.

Similarly, must hold grey_box_1. Which is in room_1. So need to go to room_1, gotoobject grey_box_1, pick it up, then drop it.

Also, constraint 9: at least once in room_1 or yellow_door_2 unlocked. Since we unlock yellow_door_2, that satisfies this (since yellow_door_2 is unlocked after toggling). So that's covered.

Constraint 10: hold yellow_box_1 or have green_door_1 unlocked. Since we need to unlock green_door_1 to go to room_4, that satisfies the second part (green_door_1 is unlocked). So that's covered.

Constraint 11: yellow_door_1 must be unlocked at least once. We need to unlock it to go from room_1 to room_2. So that's covered.

Constraint 12: at least once in room_3. The initial state already has that, but if we leave, we need to maybe return. But the constraint is "at least once", which is already satisfied. However, the last constraint says if you are in room_3 at any state, you must hold red_box_1 at that state or later. Since we start in room_3, and the initial state is that you are not holding anything, then the constraint requires that at some point after being in room_3 (including the initial state), you hold red_box_1. But red_box_1 is in room_1. So to satisfy this, you need to go to room_1, pick up red_box_1, but that's a lot. Alternatively, maybe when you are in room_3 initially, you need to pick up something and then later when you go back to room_3, you have to pick up red_box_1? Wait, red_box_1 is in room_1. So the only way to hold red_box_1 is to go to room_1, pick it up. But the last constraint says: if you are in room_3 in some state s (including the initial state), then in s or later, you must hold red_box_1. Since you start in room_3 and in the initial state you are not holding anything, you must at some point after the initial state hold red_box_1. But how? Because you need to go to room_1 to get it. So perhaps after leaving room_3, going to room_1, then getting red_box_1, then maybe returning to room_3 again? But that's a detour.

Alternatively, maybe after unlocking yellow_door_2 and going to room_1, you can pick up red_box_1 there. Then, when you go back through room_1 to room_3 (if needed), you would have held it. But the constraint is that whenever you are in room_3, you must hold red_box_1 at that time or later. So if you are in room_3 initially, then at some point after, you have to hold red_box_1. So even if you leave room_3 and never return, you still have to have held red_box_1. Because the initial state counts as being in room_3. So you have to hold red_box_1 at some point in the plan.

But red_box_1 is in room_1. So the steps would include going to room_1, picking up red_box_1, then dropping it (if needed). But that's adding more steps. Let's see.

So putting it all together:

The main steps would be:

1. In room_3, pick up green_ball_1 (to satisfy constraint 7).
   - Gotoobject green_ball_1 room_3
   - pick green_ball_1 room_3
   - drop green_ball_1 room_3 (if needed, but maybe just holding it once is enough)
2. Then, unlock yellow_door_2 (to go to room_1).
   - gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_3 room_1
   - toggle yellow_door_2 (unlocks it)
3. Go to room_1 via yellow_door_2.
   - gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_2
4. In room_1, pick up grey_box_1 (constraint 8).
   - gotoobject grey_box_1 room_1
   - pick grey_box_1 room_1
   - drop grey_box_1 room_1
5. Also in room_1, pick up red_box_1 (to satisfy constraint 13).
   - gotoobject red_box_1 room_1
   - pick red_box_1 room_1
   - drop red_box_1 room_1
6. Then, unlock yellow_door_1 (to go to room_2).
   - gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2
   - toggle yellow_door_1
7. Go to room_2.
   - gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1
8. In room_2, unlock green_door_1 (to go to room_4).
   - gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4
   - toggle green_door_1
9. Go to room_4.
   - gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1
10. Now in room_4, go to blue_box_1.
    - gotoobject blue_box_1 room_4
11. Pick up blue_box_1 (satisfies constraint 1).
    - pick blue_box_1 room_4
12. Drop blue_box_1 (to be in front of it again, fulfilling the goal).
    - drop blue_box_1 room_4

But wait, the goal is to be in room_4 and in front of a blue box. After step 12, you are in front of blue_box_1, and in room_4. So that's the goal.

Now let's check all constraints:

1. Hold blue_box_1 (step 11) and some object: yes.
2. grey_door_1 remains locked: never toggled.
3. Be in room_4 (step 9 onwards): yes.
4. Entering room_4 (step 9) requires having held an object before. Let's see: before step 9, you picked up green_ball_1, grey_box_1, red_box_1. So yes.
5. Be in front of blue_box_1 (step 10 and 12): yes.
6. Being in front of blue_box_1 (steps 10 and 12) requires having been in room_2 before (step 7). Yes.
7. Hold green_ball_1 (step 1): yes.
8. Hold grey_box_1 (step 4): yes.
9. At least once in room_1 or yellow_door_2 unlocked. We unlocked yellow_door_2 (step 2), so yes.
10. At least once hold yellow_box_1 or green_door_1 unlocked. We unlocked green_door_1 (step 8), so yes.
11. At least once yellow_door_1 unlocked (step 6): yes.
12. At least once in room_3. Initial state, yes.
13. If in room_3 (initially), then hold red_box_1 at some point. We do pick it up (step 5), so yes.

This seems to satisfy all constraints. Now, the plan steps:

But let's check the order. Let me outline the steps properly.

Starting in room_3.

1. gotoobject green_ball_1 room_3
2. pick green_ball_1 room_3 (now holding it)
3. drop green_ball_1 room_3 (optional? Maybe not needed, but if we need to free hands)
But we need to drop it somewhere. But the drop requires being in front of an empty spot. So after picking, we can gotoempty, then drop. Or just drop in the same spot. Wait, the drop action requires that you are in front of the object you drop. Wait, no. The drop action's effect is that you drop the object in front of you, and you must be in the same room. So after picking, you are no longer in front of the object, so to drop, you need to be in front of an empty position. So maybe:

1. gotoobject green_ball_1 room_3
2. pick green_ball_1 room_3
3. gotoempty (in room_3)
4. drop green_ball_1 room_3 (now holding nothing again)

But this adds steps. However, since the constraint is just to hold green_ball_1 at least once, step 2 suffices. Do we need to drop it? Not necessarily, unless we need to free hands for other actions. But the "pick" action requires that you're not holding anything. So after picking green_ball_1, you can't pick another object unless you drop it. But in this plan, after step 2, you need to go to the door, which requires moving. So maybe after step 2, you can drop the green_ball_1 to have free hands. Let's see:

But the "drop" action requires that you are holding the object and in front of an empty spot. So after picking green_ball_1, you are no longer in front of it. So you need to go to an empty spot, then drop. So steps:

1. gotoobject green_ball_1 room_3
2. pick green_ball_1 room_3
3. gotoempty (room_3)
4. drop green_ball_1 room_3

But this uses 4 steps. Alternatively, after picking, you can just proceed to the door, but you need to toggle the door, which requires being in front of it. So maybe after step 2, you go to the door:

1. gotoobject green_ball_1 room_3
2. pick green_ball_1 room_3
3. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_3 room_1 (but can you do this while holding the ball? The preconditions for gotodoor are that you're in a room connected by the door and no object is blocking. Holding an object doesn't block that. So yes, possible.
4. toggle yellow_door_2 (unlock)
5. gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_2 (now in room_1)
6. Now, in room_1, need to pick up grey_box_1 and red_box_1.

But after step 2, you're holding green_ball_1, so to pick up other objects, you need to drop it first. So perhaps steps:

1. gotoobject green_ball_1 room_3
2. pick green_ball_1 room_3
3. gotoempty room_3
4. drop green_ball_1 room_3
5. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_3 room_1
6. toggle yellow_door_2
7. gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_2
8. Now in room_1, gotoobject grey_box_1 room_1
9. pick grey_box_1 room_1
10. gotoempty room_1
11. drop grey_box_1 room_1
12. gotoobject red_box_1 room_1
13. pick red_box_1 room_1
14. gotoempty room_1
15. drop red_box_1 room_1
16. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2
17. toggle yellow_door_1
18. gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1
19. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4
20. toggle green_door_1
21. gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1
22. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_4
23. pick blue_box_1 room_4
24. gotoempty room_4
25. drop blue_box_1 room_4

But this is getting long. Let me check if all steps are necessary.

Wait, after step 7, you're in room_1. You need to pick grey_box_1 (constraint 8) and red_box_1 (constraint 13). So steps 8-15 handle that. Then unlock yellow_door_1, go to room_2, unlock green_door_1, go to room_4, then handle blue_box_1.

But is this the shortest possible plan? Let's see if any steps can be optimized.

For example, after dropping green_ball_1, you don't need to carry it. But to satisfy the constraint, you just need to hold it once. So steps 1-4 are necessary. Then steps 5-7 to get to room_1. Then in room_1, steps 8-15 to pick and drop grey_box_1 and red_box_1.

But maybe instead of dropping grey_box_1 and red_box_1, we could carry them, but since we need to unlock doors, we need free hands to toggle. Wait, the toggle action can be done while holding an object. The preconditions for toggle are that you are in front of the door. Holding an object doesn't prevent that. So perhaps after picking up grey_box_1, you can carry it while unlocking doors. But to pick up red_box_1, you need to drop grey_box_1 first. Let's see:

Alternative approach in room_1:

8. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_1
9. pick grey_box_1 room_1 (now holding it)
10. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2
11. toggle yellow_door_1 (unlock)
12. gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1 (carrying grey_box_1)
13. in room_2, gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4
14. toggle green_door_1 (still holding grey_box_1)
15. gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1 (now in room_4, holding grey_box_1)
16. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_4
17. drop grey_box_1 room_4 (no, because you need to drop in front of an empty spot. Wait, no. The drop action allows you to drop the object in front of you, which must be empty. So after step 16, you're in front of blue_box_1. Can't drop there because it's occupied. So need to gotoempty first.

But this complicates things. Also, we need to pick up red_box_1 to satisfy constraint 13. So perhaps it's better to handle red_box_1 in room_1.

Let me rethink. Maybe after entering room_1, pick up red_box_1 and carry it through.

But then when you go to room_2, you can't pick up anything else unless you drop it. But maybe that's okay. However, the constraint for room_3 requires that if you're in room_3 (which you are initially), you must hold red_box_1 at some point. Since you pick it up in room_1, that's after leaving room_3, which satisfies the constraint.

Wait, the constraint says: if you are in room_3 in state s, then in s or later you must hold red_box_1. Since you were in room_3 initially, you need to hold red_box_1 at some point after that. So picking it up in room_1 is after leaving room_3, which is okay.

So steps could be:

1. In room_3, pick green_ball_1, drop it.
2. Unlock yellow_door_2, go to room_1.
3. In room_1, pick grey_box_1, drop it.
4. Pick red_box_1, carry it.
5. Unlock yellow_door_1, go to room_2.
6. Unlock green_door_1, go to room_4, carrying red_box_1.
7. Drop red_box_1 in room_4 (if needed).
8. Go to blue_box_1, pick and drop it.

But why carry red_box_1? Because after picking it up in room_1, you can carry it to room_4 and drop it there. But this would satisfy the requirement to have held red_box_1 after being in room_3. However, dropping it isn't necessary unless you need to free hands. But you need to pick up blue_box_1, which requires dropping red_box_1 first.

So steps:

1. gotoobject green_ball_1 room_3
2. pick green_ball_1 room_3
3. gotoempty room_3
4. drop green_ball_1 room_3
5. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_3 room_1
6. toggle yellow_door_2
7. gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_2
8. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_1
9. pick grey_box_1 room_1
10. gotoempty room_1
11. drop grey_box_1 room_1
12. gotoobject red_box_1 room_1
13. pick red_box_1 room_1
14. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2
15. toggle yellow_door_1
16. gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1
17. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4
18. toggle green_door_1
19. gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1
20. gotoempty room_4
21. drop red_box_1 room_4
22. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_4
23. pick blue_box_1 room_4
24. gotoempty room_4
25. drop blue_box_1 room_4

But this is quite long. Is there a shorter way?

Alternatively, after step 13 (holding red_box_1), go directly to the door:

14. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2 (while holding red_box_1)
15. toggle yellow_door_1
16. gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1 (still holding red_box_1)
17. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4 (still holding)
18. toggle green_door_1
19. gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1
20. gotoempty room_4
21. drop red_box_1 room_4
22. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_4
23. pick blue_box_1 room_4
24. drop blue_box_1 room_4 (if needed)

But this skips dropping grey_box_1. But we need to hold grey_box_1 (constraint 8). So step 9-11 are necessary.

So the steps are:

- Handle green_ball_1 in room_3.
- Unlock and go to room_1.
- Pick and drop grey_box_1 in room_1.
- Pick red_box_1 and carry it to room_4, drop it there.
- Then handle blue_box_1.

This covers all constraints except perhaps the last one. But holding red_box_1 in step 13 satisfies the constraint that after being in room_3, you hold red_box_1.

Now, checking all constraints again:

1. Hold blue_box_1: yes (step 23).
2. grey_door_1 remains locked: yes.
3. Be in room_4: yes (step 19 onwards).
4. Entering room_4 requires having held an object before (red_box_1 in step 13).
5. In front of blue_box_1: yes (steps 22-24).
6. Before step 22, was in room_2 (step 16-19): yes.
7. Hold green_ball_1: step 2.
8. Hold grey_box_1: step 9.
9. yellow_door_2 is unlocked: step 6.
10. green_door_1 is unlocked: step 18.
11. yellow_door_1 is unlocked: step 15.
12. Be in room_3 initially: yes.
13. Hold red_box_1 after being in room_3: yes (step 13).

This seems to work. Now, the plan steps would be:

```
gotoobject green_ball_1 room_3
pick green_ball_1 room_3
gotoempty room_3
drop green_ball_1 room_3
gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_3 room_1
toggle yellow_door_2
gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_2
gotoobject grey_box_1 room_1
pick grey_box_1 room_1
gotoempty room_1
drop grey_box_1 room_1
gotoobject red_box_1 room_1
pick red_box_1 room_1
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2
toggle yellow_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1
gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4
toggle green_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1
gotoempty room_4
drop red_box_1 room_4
gotoobject blue_box_1 room_4
pick blue_box_1 room_4
gotoempty room_4
drop blue_box_1 room_4
```

But this is 23 actions. Maybe there's a shorter way. For example, after picking up green_ball_1 in room_3, perhaps we don't need to drop it if we can carry it to room_1 and drop it there, but that would require more steps. Alternatively, if we can unlock doors while holding objects, then maybe we can optimize.

Wait, when you toggle a door, you just need to be in front of it. Holding an object doesn't affect that. So after picking green_ball_1, you can go to yellow_door_2, unlock it, then go to room_1. Then drop the green_ball_1 in room_1. That saves the steps of dropping in room_3 and then moving to the door.

Let me try:

1. gotoobject green_ball_1 room_3
2. pick green_ball_1 room_3
3. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_3 room_1
4. toggle yellow_door_2
5. gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_2
6. gotoempty room_1
7. drop green_ball_1 room_1
8. Now in room_1, handle grey_box_1 and red_box_1.
...

This reduces steps. So steps 3-7 replace the previous steps 3-7. Now steps would be:

1. gotoobject green_ball_1 room_3
2. pick green_ball_1 room_3
3. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_3 room_1
4. toggle yellow_door_2
5. gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_2
6. gotoempty room_1
7. drop green_ball_1 room_1
8. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_1
9. pick grey_box_1 room_1
10. gotoempty room_1
11. drop grey_box_1 room_1
12. gotoobject red_box_1 room_1
13. pick red_box_1 room_1
14. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2
15. toggle yellow_door_1
16. gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1
17. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4
18. toggle green_door_1
19. gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1
20. gotoempty room_4
21. drop red_box_1 room_4
22. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_4
23. pick blue_box_1 room_4
24. gotoempty room_4
25. drop blue_box_1 room_4

This is 25 steps, which is longer. So maybe the original approach is better.

Alternatively, after step 2 (holding green_ball_1), go directly to the door, unlock it, go to room_1, drop green_ball_1 there. Then proceed.

But this may save steps. Let's count:

Original approach: 23 steps.

Alternative approach:

1. gotoobject green_ball_1 room_3
2. pick green_ball_1 room_3
3. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_3 room_1
4. toggle yellow_door_2
5. gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_2
6. gotoempty room_1
7. drop green_ball_1 room_1 (now in room_1, dropped green_ball_1)
8. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_1
9. pick grey_box_1 room_1
10. gotoempty room_1
11. drop grey_box_1 room_1
12. gotoobject red_box_1 room_1
13. pick red_box_1 room_1
14. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2
15. toggle yellow_door_1
16. gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1
17. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4
18. toggle green_door_1
19. gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1
20. gotoempty room_4
21. drop red_box_1 room_4
22. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_4
23. pick blue_box_1 room_4
24. gotoempty room_4
25. drop blue_box_1 room_4

This is 25 steps. The only difference is saving the initial drop in room_3. But in this case, we have to carry green_ball_1 to room_1 and drop it there. The step count increases, so this isn't better. So the original plan might be more efficient.

But perhaps there's a way to avoid dropping grey_box_1 and red_box_1. For example, if we don't need to drop them, but that's not possible because we need to pick up multiple objects. For example, after picking grey_box_1, we need to drop it to pick red_box_1. So steps 8-11 are necessary.

Alternatively, can we toggle doors without dropping objects? Yes, but carrying objects doesn't affect toggling. So after picking red_box_1 in room_1, we can carry it through to room_4 and drop it there. That's fine.

So the steps after picking red_box_1 in room_1 (step 13):

14. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2 (while holding red_box_1)
15. toggle yellow_door_1
16. gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1
17. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4
18. toggle green_door_1
19. gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1
20. gotoempty room_4
21. drop red_box_1 room_4
22. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_4
23. pick blue_box_1 room_4
24. gotoempty room_4
25. drop blue_box_1 room_4

This saves some steps. But the total steps are still 25. Hmm.

Wait, maybe after unlocking green_door_1, you can immediately go to room_4, and then handle blue_box_1. But you need to drop red_box_1 first. Let's see:

After step 19, you're in room_4 holding red_box_1. Then you need to drop it (step 20-21). Then go to blue_box_1 (step 22), pick and drop. So steps are necessary.

Is there a way to avoid dropping blue_box_1? The goal requires being in front of it. If you pick it up and then drop it, you're in front of it. Alternatively, if you just go to it and are in front of it without picking, that would be better. But the constraint requires holding blue_box_1 at least once, so you have to pick it up.

So steps 22-25 are necessary.

Alternatively, after picking blue_box_1, you can drop it in the same spot, but you need to be in front of an empty position to drop. So after picking, you have to move to an empty spot to drop. Hence steps 24-25.

But maybe there's an empty spot in front of blue_box_1. Wait, when you pick up blue_box_1, it's removed from the room, so the spot where it was is now empty. So after picking it up, you can drop it back in the same spot. Let's see:

After picking blue_box_1 (step 23), you are no longer in front of it. So to drop it back, you need to go to where it was. But when you pick it up, it's removed from the room. So the position becomes empty. So you can gotoempty (the same spot) and drop. So:

23. pick blue_box_1 room_4
24. gotoempty room_4 (the spot where blue_box_1 was)
25. drop blue_box_1 room_4

But this requires that after picking, you move back to the empty spot.

Alternatively, after picking, you can just drop it immediately if you're in front of an empty spot. But after picking, you are no longer in front of the object. So you need to move to an empty spot to drop. So steps 24-25 are needed.

Thus, the plan seems to require these steps. Now, checking for optimality. Is there a shorter path?

What if we don't need to drop some objects? For example, after picking green_ball_1, can we carry it through and drop it in room_1, then proceed. But that's what we did.

Alternatively, can we combine some actions? For example, after unlocking yellow_door_2 and entering room_1, can we pick both grey_box_1 and red_box_1 without dropping? No, because you can only carry one object at a time.

Another optimization: After dropping grey_box_1 in room_1, you can go directly to red_box_1 without moving to empty. But you need to be in front of red_box_1 to pick it up. So steps would be:

8. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_1
9. pick grey_box_1 room_1
10. drop grey_box_1 room_1 (if you're still in front of it after picking? Wait, no. The effect of pick is that you are no longer in front of x. So after picking, you need to go to an empty spot to drop. Or, after picking, you can go to another object's location. But to drop, you need to be in front of an empty spot.

Wait, after picking grey_box_1, you are no longer in front of it. So to drop it, you need to go to an empty spot and drop. So steps 10-11 are necessary.

Similarly for red_box_1.

Thus, the steps can't be shortened further. The plan length is 25 steps, but perhaps there's a shorter way.

Wait, perhaps after picking green_ball_1, instead of dropping it, you can use it to satisfy another constraint. For example, if you need to hold green_ball_1 and also need to hold blue_box_1, but since they are different objects, you have to pick and drop each.

Alternatively, maybe some steps can be merged. Let's see:

Wait, after step 13 (pick red_box_1), you can immediately go to the door without dropping, since you need to carry it. Then in room_4, drop it. So steps:

13. pick red_box_1 room_1
14. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2
15. toggle yellow_door_1
16. gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1
17. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4
18. toggle green_door_1
19. gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1
20. gotoempty room_4
21. drop red_box_1 room_4
22. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_4
23. pick blue_box_1 room_4
24. gotoempty room_4
25. drop blue_box_1 room_4

This part is the same.

But perhaps in room_1, after dropping grey_box_1, you can go directly to red_box_1 without moving to empty. For example:

8. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_1
9. pick grey_box_1 room_1
10. gotoempty room_1
11. drop grey_box_1 room_1
12. gotoobject red_box_1 room_1
13. pick red_box_1 room_1
14. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2
...

This seems necessary.

Is there any way to avoid picking and dropping grey_box_1? No, because the constraint requires holding grey_box_1 at least once.

Similarly, must hold green_ball_1.

So the steps seem unavoidable.

Thus, the optimal plan is likely the one with 25 steps. However, perhaps there's a way to optimize by combining some actions.

Wait, let's think differently. The main goal is to be in room_4 in front of blue_box_1. Since blue_box_1 is already in room_4, perhaps the optimal path is to go there directly, but given the constraints.

But to get to room_4 from room_3, the only available door is grey_door_1, which must remain locked. So you have to take the long path: room_3 -> room_1 -> room_2 -> room_4.

But all doors are initially locked. So the steps must include unlocking yellow_door_2 (room_3 to room_1), yellow_door_1 (room_1 to room_2), and green_door_1 (room_2 to room_4).

So the minimal steps would be:

1. Unlock yellow_door_2.
2. Go to room_1.
3. Unlock yellow_door_1.
4. Go to room_2.
5. Unlock green_door_1.
6. Go to room_4.
7. Go to blue_box_1 and pick/drop.

But this is 7 steps, but ignoring the constraints. However, the constraints require additional actions:

- Hold blue_box_1.
- Hold green_ball_1.
- Hold grey_box_1.
- Hold red_box_1 after being in room_3.
- Etc.

So integrating these steps into the plan.

But maybe the minimal plan would be:

1. gotoobject green_ball_1 room_3
2. pick green_ball_1 room_3
3. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_3 room_1
4. toggle yellow_door_2
5. gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_2
6. gotoempty room_1
7. drop green_ball_1 room_1
8. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_1
9. pick grey_box_1 room_1
10. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2
11. toggle yellow_door_1
12. gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1
13. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4
14. toggle green_door_1
15. gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1
16. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_4
17. pick blue_box_1 room_4
18. gotoempty room_4
19. drop blue_box_1 room_4
20. gotoobject red_box_1 room_1 (but wait, red_box_1 is in room_1, but we are now in room_4. So this approach misses picking red_box_1, which is required by constraint 13. So we need to handle that.

Ah, this is the problem. To satisfy constraint 13, you must hold red_box_1 after being in room_3. So you have to go back to room_1 after unlocking the doors, pick red_box_1, and carry it to room_4.

But that adds steps. For example, after step 15 (in room_4), you need to return to room_1 via the same path, pick red_box_1, then go back to room_4. Which is very inefficient. So the earlier approach of picking red_box_1 in room_1 before going to room_2 is better.

Thus, the minimal plan has to include these steps. Therefore, the plan I outlined earlier is likely optimal, but it's possible that there's a shorter way.

Wait, another idea: Maybe after unlocking yellow_door_2 and entering room_1, you can pick up red_box_1 and carry it through to room_4, satisfying the constraint. Then in room_4, you can drop it and pick up blue_box_1. This way, you don't need to handle grey_box_1 and red_box_1 separately. But wait, the constraint requires holding grey_box_1 at least once, so you can't skip that.

So you have to pick up grey_box_1 and red_box_1 in room_1. This means:

In room_1:

1. Pick grey_box_1, drop it.
2. Pick red_box_1, carry it.

Thus, steps 8-13 in the earlier plan.

This seems unavoidable. So the total steps are:

- 4 steps for green_ball_1 in room_3.
- 5 steps to get to room_1.
- 6 steps in room_1 (grey_box_1 and red_box_1).
- 6 steps to get to room_4.
- 4 steps for blue_box_1 in room_4.
Total: 4+5+6+6+4=25 steps.

But maybe there's a way to reduce this. For example, after picking red_box_1 in room_1, instead of going to yellow_door_1, maybe go directly to green_door_1. But room_1 and room_4 are not connected directly. You have to go through room_2.

No, the connections are room_1 connected to room_2 via yellow_door_1, and room_2 connected to room_4 via green_door_1. So path is necessary.

Thus, the plan is optimal as outlined.
