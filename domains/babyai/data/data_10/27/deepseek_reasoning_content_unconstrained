Okay, let's try to figure out how to solve this planning problem. So the goal is to have a blue box in room_4, with me also in room_4 and in front of that box. The constraints aren't listed here, but I need to make sure I follow all the action preconditions and effects.

First, let's look at the initial state. I'm in room_3. The blue_box_1 is in room_4. Wait, that's already in the goal room. So maybe I just need to get to room_4 and be in front of blue_box_1. But wait, the initial state says all doors are locked. So I need to unlock doors to move between rooms.

So, starting in room_3. The doors connected to room_3 are yellow_door_2 (connects to room_1) and grey_door_1 (connects to room_4). Both are locked. So to get to room_4 from room_3, I need to go through grey_door_1, but it's locked. So I need to toggle it. But to toggle a door, I need to be in front of it. To get in front of it, I have to go to the door in my current room. Since I'm in room_3, the grey_door_1 connects room_3 and room_4. So I can goto door grey_door_1 from room_3. But wait, the preconditions for "gotodoor" are that I'm in a room connected by the door, and no object is blocking the position in front of the door. Are there any objects blocking doors in room_3?

Looking at the initial state: in room_3, there's grey_ball_1, blue_ball_1, yellow_box_1, green_ball_1. Are any of these blocking the door? The problem states that objects can block doors if they are in front of them. But the initial state doesn't mention any objects blocking doors. So maybe the doors aren't blocked. So I can go to the grey_door_1 in room_3.

So first step: gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4. Then toggle it to unlock. Then gotoroom room_3 room_4 grey_door_1. Then once in room_4, I need to go to the blue_box_1. Since blue_box_1 is already in room_4, I just need to gotoobject blue_box_1 room_4. Then drop any object if needed? Wait, no. The goal is to be in front of a blue box in room_4. But I don't need to pick or drop anything. Wait, the goal is "there is a box v such that v is blue, in room_4, you are in room_4, and you are in front of v". Since blue_box_1 is already in room_4, I just need to be in room_4 and in front of it. So the plan should be:

1. Go to grey_door_1 in room_3.
2. Toggle grey_door_1 to unlock it.
3. Move through grey_door_1 to room_4.
4. Go to blue_box_1 in room_4.

But wait, the preconditions for "gotoobject" require that I'm in the same room as the object. Once in room_4, yes. So steps would be:

Action: gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4
Action: toggle grey_door_1
Action: gotoroom room_3 room_4 grey_door_1
Action: gotoobject blue_box_1 room_4

But wait, after moving to room_4, the agent is no longer in front of anything. So after entering room_4, they need to go to the blue_box_1. Let's check each action's effects.

After gotoroom, the agent is in room_4 and not in front of anything. So next step is gotoobject blue_box_1 room_4, which requires being in the same room as the object (room_4), which is true. Then the agent is in front of blue_box_1, meeting the goal.

But let's check if any doors are blocked. For example, when going to the door in room_3, are there any objects blocking the position in front of the door? The initial state doesn't mention any objects blocking doors, so assuming that doors are not blocked. So the plan should work.

But wait, the doors are all locked initially. So I need to unlock grey_door_1. So the toggle action after going to the door will unlock it, allowing me to move through.

So the plan would be:

```
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4
toggle grey_door_1
gotoroom room_3 room_4 grey_door_1
gotoobject blue_box_1 room_4
```

But wait, when you perform gotoroom, you leave the current room and enter the new one, and you are no longer in front of any object. Then, in room_4, you need to go to the blue_box_1. Since the blue_box_1 is in room_4, that's allowed.

Yes, that seems correct. Let me check if there's a shorter plan. For example, can I go through another door? Let's see. From room_3, the other door is yellow_door_2 to room_1. But that's locked. To get to room_4, maybe via room_1 and room_2? But that would be longer. The direct path through grey_door_1 is better.

So the plan is 4 actions. That should be optimal.
