Alright, I need to solve a planning problem in a gridworld. Let me analyze the problem first:

**Domain:**
- 4 rooms arranged in a square: room_1 (northwest), room_2 (southwest), room_3 (northeast), room_4 (southeast)
- Doors connecting rooms: room_1-room_2, room_1-room_3, room_2-room_4, room_3-room_4
- Objects: boxes and balls, each with a color
- The agent can move, pick up objects, drop objects, and toggle doors

**Initial State:**
- Agent is in room_3
- red_box_1, grey_box_1, red_box_2 are in room_1
- grey_ball_1, blue_ball_1, yellow_box_1, green_ball_1 are in room_3
- blue_box_1 is in room_4
- All doors are locked
- Agent is not holding any object
- Agent has visited room_3

**Goal:**
- Be in room_4
- Be in front of blue_box_1, which is in room_4

**Constraints:**
1. At some point, you must be holding blue_box_1
2. grey_door_1 is always locked (can't use this door)
3. At some point, you must be in room_4
4. Before being in room_4, you must have held some object
5. At some point, you must be in front of blue_box_1
6. Before being in front of blue_box_1, you must have been in room_2
7. At some point, you must be holding green_ball_1
8. At some point, you must be holding grey_box_1
9. At some point, either you are in room_1 or yellow_door_2 is unlocked
10. At some point, either you are holding yellow_box_1 or green_door_1 is unlocked
11. At some point, yellow_door_1 must be unlocked
12. At some point, you must be in room_3
13. If you are in room_3, you must hold red_box_1 at that point or afterward

Alright, let's start planning:

First, I need to outline a path that satisfies all constraints. Let's think through this logically:

1. We start in room_3.
2. We need to visit room_1 and room_2 before going to room_4 (due to constraints 6 and 9).
3. We need to pick up multiple objects (green_ball_1, grey_box_1, red_box_1, blue_box_1, possibly yellow_box_1).
4. We need to toggle some doors to move between rooms (yellow_door_1, yellow_door_2, green_door_1).
5. We must end up in room_4 with blue_box_1.

Let me trace a possible path:

1. Start in room_3.
2. Pick up green_ball_1 (to satisfy constraint 7).
3. Go to the yellow_door_2 which connects room_3 and room_1.
4. Toggle yellow_door_2 to unlock it (satisfying part of constraint 9).
5. Enter room_1.
6. Drop green_ball_1 (so we can pick up other objects).
7. Pick up grey_box_1 (to satisfy constraint 8).
8. Go to yellow_door_1 which connects room_1 and room_2.
9. Toggle yellow_door_1 to unlock it (satisfying constraint 11).
10. Enter room_2 (satisfying part of constraint 6).
11. Drop grey_box_1.
12. Pick up yellow_box_1 (to satisfy part of constraint 10, assuming we bring it from room_3 to room_2 somehow).
13. Go to green_door_1 which connects room_2 and room_4.
14. Toggle green_door_1 to unlock it.
15. Enter room_4 (satisfying constraint 3).
16. Drop yellow_box_1.
17. Go in front of blue_box_1 (satisfying constraint 5).
18. Pick up blue_box_1 (satisfying constraint 1).
19. Drop blue_box_1 (to return to the initial state where it's in room_4).
20. Go in front of blue_box_1 (completing the goal).

But there's an issue: I need to pick up red_box_1 after being in room_3 (constraint 13) and I need to bring yellow_box_1 from room_3 to room_2 for constraint 10. Let me refine this plan.

Actually, let's look at this more carefully. The constraints are quite intricate and I want to make sure I understand them correctly:

- Constraint 9: At some point, either I'm in room_1 OR yellow_door_2 is unlocked.
- Constraint 10: At some point, either I'm holding yellow_box_1 OR green_door_1 is unlocked.
- Constraint 13: If I'm in room_3, I must hold red_box_1 at that point or afterward.

Let me trace a new path:

1. Start in room_3.
2. Pick up green_ball_1 (to satisfy constraint 7).
3. Go to yellow_door_2 which connects room_3 and room_1.
4. Toggle yellow_door_2 to unlock it (satisfying part of constraint 9).
5. Enter room_1 (satisfying the other part of constraint 9).
6. Drop green_ball_1.
7. Pick up grey_box_1 (to satisfy constraint 8).
8. Go to yellow_door_1 which connects room_1 and room_2.
9. Toggle yellow_door_1 to unlock it (satisfying constraint 11).
10. Enter room_2 (satisfying part of constraint 6).
11. Drop grey_box_1.
12. Pick up red_box_1 (to satisfy constraint 13 later).
13. Go to green_door_1 which connects room_2 and room_4.
14. Toggle green_door_1 to unlock it (satisfying part of constraint 10).
15. Enter room_4 (satisfying constraint 3).
16. Drop red_box_1.
17. Go in front of blue_box_1 (satisfying constraint 5).
18. Pick up blue_box_1 (satisfying constraint 1).
19. Go back to room_3 (using the now unlocked doors).
20. (This satisfies constraint 13: I'm in room_3 and holding red_box_1).
21. Return to room_4.
22. Drop blue_box_1 (to return to the initial state where it's in room_4).
23. Go in front of blue_box_1 (completing the goal).

Ah, I still have some issues. Let me go through the constraints again and make sure I'm meeting all of them:

1. ✅ At some point, you must be holding blue_box_1.
2. ✅ grey_door_1 is always locked (I won't use this door).
3. ✅ At some point, you must be in room_4.
4. ✅ Before being in room_4, you must have held some object.
5. ✅ At some point, you must be in front of blue_box_1.
6. ✅ Before being in front of blue_box_1, you must have been in room_2.
7. ✅ At some point, you must be holding green_ball_1.
8. ✅ At some point, you must be holding grey_box_1.
9. ✅ At some point, either you are in room_1 or yellow_door_2 is unlocked.
10. ❌ At some point, either you are holding yellow_box_1 or green_door_1 is unlocked. (I've unlocked green_door_1 in my plan, but I also need to make sure I pick up yellow_box_1 which is in room_3 initially).
11. ✅ At some point, yellow_door_1 must be unlocked.
12. ✅ At some point, you must be in room_3.
13. ❌ If you are in room_3, you must hold red_box_1 at that point or afterward. (I need to pick up red_box_1 from room_1, but the constraint says I need to hold red_box_1 after being in room_3).

So I have two issues to resolve:
1. I need to pick up yellow_box_1 from room_3 at some point.
2. I need to hold red_box_1 after being in room_3, but red_box_1 is in room_1 initially.

Let me refine the plan:

1. Start in room_3.
2. Pick up yellow_box_1 (to satisfy part of constraint 10).
3. Go to yellow_door_2 which connects room_3 and room_1.
4. Toggle yellow_door_2 to unlock it (satisfying part of constraint 9).
5. Enter room_1 (satisfying the other part of constraint 9).
6. Drop yellow_box_1.
7. Pick up red_box_1 (to satisfy constraint 13 later).
8. Go to yellow_door_1 which connects room_1 and room_2.
9. Toggle yellow_door_1 to unlock it (satisfying constraint 11).
10. Enter room_2 (satisfying part of constraint 6).
11. Drop red_box_1.
12. Pick up grey_box_1 (which should be in room_1 initially, so I need to adjust).
13. Go to green_door_1 which connects room_2 and room_4.
14. Toggle green_door_1 to unlock it (satisfying part of constraint 10).
15. Enter room_4 (satisfying constraint 3).
16. Drop grey_box_1.
17. Go in front of blue_box_1 (satisfying constraint 5).
18. Pick up blue_box_1 (satisfying constraint 1).
19. Go back to room_2, then room_1, then room_3 (using the now unlocked doors).
20. (This satisfies constraint 13: I'm in room_3 and holding blue_box_1).
21. Drop blue_box_1.
22. Pick up green_ball_1 (to satisfy constraint 7).
23. Return to room_4 (via room_1 and room_2).
24. Drop green_ball_1.
25. Pick up blue_box_1.
26. Drop blue_box_1 (to return to the state where it's in room_4).
27. Go in front of blue_box_1 (completing the goal).

Actually, the plan is still not satisfying all constraints. Let's revise more carefully:

1. Constraint 13 says: "If you are in room_3, you must hold red_box_1 at that point or afterward."
   Since we start in room_3, we must pick up red_box_1 at some point in our plan. But red_box_1 is in room_1 initially, so we need to go to room_1, pick it up, and then hold it.

2. Constraint 6 says: "Before being in front of blue_box_1, you must have been in room_2."
   So we need to visit room_2 before heading to room_4 to be in front of blue_box_1.

3. Constraint 4 says: "Before being in room_4, you must have held some object."
   So we need to pick up at least one object before entering room_4.

Let's try another plan:

1. Start in room_3.
2. Pick up green_ball_1 (to satisfy constraint 7).
3. Go to yellow_door_2 which connects room_3 and room_1.
4. Toggle yellow_door_2 to unlock it (satisfying part of constraint 9).
5. Enter room_1 (satisfying the other part of constraint 9).
6. Drop green_ball_1.
7. Pick up red_box_1 (to satisfy constraint 13 later).
8. Go to yellow_door_1 which connects room_1 and room_2.
9. Toggle yellow_door_1 to unlock it (satisfying constraint 11).
10. Enter room_2 (satisfying part of constraint 6).
11. Drop red_box_1.
12. Pick up grey_box_1 (to satisfy constraint 8). But grey_box_1 is in room_1 initially, not room_2.

Okay, I need to keep track of where each object is. Let me state the initial positions more explicitly:

- red_box_1 is in room_1
- grey_box_1 is in room_1
- red_box_2 is in room_1
- grey_ball_1 is in room_3
- blue_ball_1 is in room_3
- yellow_box_1 is in room_3
- green_ball_1 is in room_3
- blue_box_1 is in room_4

Let me try a new approach:

1. Start in room_3.
2. Pick up yellow_box_1 (to satisfy part of constraint 10).
3. Go to yellow_door_2 which connects room_3 and room_1.
4. Toggle yellow_door_2 to unlock it (satisfying part of constraint 9).
5. Enter room_1 (satisfying the other part of constraint 9).
6. Drop yellow_box_1.
7. Pick up grey_box_1 (to satisfy constraint 8).
8. Go to yellow_door_1 which connects room_1 and room_2.
9. Toggle yellow_door_1 to unlock it (satisfying constraint 11).
10. Enter room_2 (satisfying part of constraint 6).
11. Drop grey_box_1.
12. Go back to room_1.
13. Pick up red_box_1 (for constraint 13).
14. Go back to room_2.
15. Go to green_door_1 which connects room_2 and room_4.
16. Toggle green_door_1 to unlock it (satisfying part of constraint 10).
17. Enter room_4 (satisfying constraint 3 and 4 since I'm holding red_box_1).
18. Drop red_box_1.
19. Go in front of blue_box_1 (satisfying constraint 5).
20. Pick up blue_box_1 (satisfying constraint 1).
21. Go back to room_2, then room_1, then room_3 (using the now unlocked doors).
22. (This satisfies constraint 13: I'm in room_3 and holding blue_box_1).
23. Go back to room_1, then room_2, then room_4.
24. Drop blue_box_1.
25. Go in front of blue_box_1 (completing the goal).

But I'm skipping constraint 7, which requires me to hold green_ball_1 at some point. Let me incorporate that:

1. Start in room_3.
2. Pick up green_ball_1 (to satisfy constraint 7).
3. Go to yellow_door_2 which connects room_3 and room_1.
4. Toggle yellow_door_2 to unlock it (satisfying part of constraint 9).
5. Enter room_1 (satisfying the other part of constraint 9).
6. Drop green_ball_1.
7. Pick up grey_box_1 (to satisfy constraint 8).
8. Go to yellow_door_1 which connects room_1 and room_2.
9. Toggle yellow_door_1 to unlock it (satisfying constraint 11).
10. Enter room_2 (satisfying part of constraint 6).
11. Drop grey_box_1.
12. Go back to room_1.
13. Pick up red_box_1 (for constraint 13).
14. Go back to room_2.
15. Go to green_door_1 which connects room_2 and room_4.
16. Toggle green_door_1 to unlock it (satisfying part of constraint 10).
17. Enter room_4 (satisfying constraint 3 and 4 since I'm holding red_box_1).
18. Drop red_box_1.
19. Go in front of blue_box_1 (satisfying constraint 5).
20. Pick up blue_box_1 (satisfying constraint 1).
21. Go back to room_2, then room_1, then room_3 (using the now unlocked doors).
22. (This satisfies constraint 13: I'm in room_3 and holding blue_box_1).
23. Go back to room_1, then room_2, then room_4.
24. Drop blue_box_1.
25. Go in front of blue_box_1 (completing the goal).

Actually, I'm still not satisfying constraint 10: "At some point, either you are holding yellow_box_1 or green_door_1 is unlocked."

I need to pick up yellow_box_1 at some point or unlock green_door_1. In my current plan, I'm unlocking green_door_1, so I'm satisfying the constraint. 

Let me check again:

1. ✅ At some point, you must be holding blue_box_1. (Step 20)
2. ✅ grey_door_1 is always locked. (I never toggle it)
3. ✅ At some point, you must be in room_4. (Step 17)
4. ✅ Before being in room_4, you must have held some object. (I'm holding red_box_1 at step 17)
5. ✅ At some point, you must be in front of blue_box_1. (Step 19)
6. ✅ Before being in front of blue_box_1, you must have been in room_2. (Step 10)
7. ✅ At some point, you must be holding green_ball_1. (Step 2)
8. ✅ At some point, you must be holding grey_box_1. (Step 7)
9. ✅ At some point, either you are in room_1 or yellow_door_2 is unlocked. (Step 5)
10. ✅ At some point, either you are holding yellow_box_1 or green_door_1 is unlocked. (Step 16)
11. ✅ At some point, yellow_door_1 must be unlocked. (Step 9)
12. ✅ At some point, you must be in room_3. (We start in room_3 and go back in step 21)
13. ✅ If you are in room_3, you must hold red_box_1 at that point or afterward. (We pick up red_box_1 in step 13 and hold it until at least step 18)

Now, let me write the actions more explicitly for each step:

1. gotoobject green_ball_1 room_3
2. pick green_ball_1 room_3
3. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_3 room_1
4. toggle yellow_door_2
5. gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_2
6. gotoempty
7. drop green_ball_1 room_1
8. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_1
9. pick grey_box_1 room_1
10. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2
11. toggle yellow_door_1
12. gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1
13. gotoempty
14. drop grey_box_1 room_2
15. gotoroom room_2 room_1 yellow_door_1
16. gotoobject red_box_1 room_1
17. pick red_box_1 room_1
18. gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1
19. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4
20. toggle green_door_1
21. gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1
22. gotoempty
23. drop red_box_1 room_4
24. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_4
25. pick blue_box_1 room_4
26. gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_1
27. gotoroom room_2 room_1 yellow_door_1
28. gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_2
29. gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_2
30. gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1
31. gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1
32. gotoempty
33. drop blue_box_1 room_4
34. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_4

Wait, let me double-check this plan:

The first issue is that in step 13, I say I'm dropping grey_box_1 in room_2, but I'm not specifying that I need to be in front of an empty space to drop it. Let me recheck the actions:

- "drop x r": Drop object x in room r.
  Preconditions: (i) you are currently holding x, and (ii) the position in front of you is empty.

So I need to go to an empty position before dropping. Let me revise:

Another issue is that in step 25, I'm picking up blue_box_1 without specifying that I need to be in front of it first. Let me recheck the "pick" action:

- "pick x r": Pick up object x in room r.
  Preconditions: (i) you are in the same room as x, and (ii) you are currently not holding any object.

Let me revise the plan once more:

1. gotoobject green_ball_1 room_3
2. pick green_ball_1 room_3
3. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_3 room_1
4. toggle yellow_door_2
5. gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_2
6. gotoempty
7. drop green_ball_1 room_1
8. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_1
9. pick grey_box_1 room_1
10. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2
11. toggle yellow_door_1
12. gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1
13. gotoempty
14. drop grey_box_1 room_2
15. gotoroom room_2 room_1 yellow_door_1
16. gotoobject red_box_1 room_1
17. pick red_box_1 room_1
18. gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1
19. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4
20. toggle green_door_1
21. gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1
22. gotoempty
23. drop red_box_1 room_4
24. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_4
25. pick blue_box_1 room_4
26. gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_1
27. gotoroom room_2 room_1 yellow_door_1
28. gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_2
29. gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_2
30. gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1
31. gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1
32. gotoempty
33. drop blue_box_1 room_4
34. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_4

Let's check this plan against our constraints again, focusing on the sequence of states:

1. Start in room_3, not holding any object.
2. Go in front of green_ball_1 in room_3.
3. Pick up green_ball_1 (satisfying constraint 7).
4. Go in front of yellow_door_2.
5. Toggle yellow_door_2 to unlock it (satisfying part of constraint 9).
6. Enter room_1 (satisfying the other part of constraint 9).
7. Go to an empty position.
8. Drop green_ball_1.
9. Go in front of grey_box_1.
10. Pick up grey_box_1 (satisfying constraint 8).
11. Go in front of yellow_door_1.
12. Toggle yellow_door_1 to unlock it (satisfying constraint 11).
13. Enter room_2 (satisfying part of constraint 6).
14. Go to an empty position.
15. Drop grey_box_1.
16. Go back to room_1.
17. Go in front of red_box_1.
18. Pick up red_box_1 (for constraint 13).
19. Go back to room_2.
20. Go in front of green_door_1.
21. Toggle green_door_1 to unlock it (satisfying part of constraint 10).
22. Enter room_4 (satisfying constraint 3 and 4 since I'm holding red_box_1).
23. Go to an empty position.
24. Drop red_box_1.
25. Go in front of blue_box_1 (satisfying constraint 5).
26. Pick up blue_box_1 (satisfying constraint 1).
27. Go back to room_2.
28. Go back to room_1.
29. Go to room_3 (satisfying constraint 12).
30. (This satisfies constraint 13: I'm in room_3 and holding blue_box_1).
31. Go back to room_1.
32. Go back to room_2.
33. Go back to room_4.
34. Go to an empty position.
35. Drop blue_box_1.
36. Go in front of blue_box_1 (completing the goal).

This plan satisfies all the constraints. Let me write out the actions formally:

1. gotoobject green_ball_1 room_3
2. pick green_ball_1 room_3
3. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_3 room_1
4. toggle yellow_door_2
5. gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_2
6. gotoempty
7. drop green_ball_1 room_1
8. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_1
9. pick grey_box_1 room_1
10. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2
11. toggle yellow_door_1
12. gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1
13. gotoempty
14. drop grey_box_1 room_2
15. gotoroom room_2 room_1 yellow_door_1
16. gotoobject red_box_1 room_1
17. pick red_box_1 room_1
18. gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1
19. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4
20. toggle green_door_1
21. gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1
22. gotoempty
23. drop red_box_1 room_4
24. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_4
25. pick blue_box_1 room_4
26. gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_1
27. gotoroom room_2 room_1 yellow_door_1
28. gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_2
29. gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_2
30. gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1
31. gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1
32. gotoempty
33. drop blue_box_1 room_4
34. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_4

Actually, I'm realizing there's a problem here. In step 26, I'm holding blue_box_1 and trying to go from room_4 to room_2. But if I'm holding blue_box_1, then it's no longer in room_4, it's in my hands. The goal requires blue_box_1 to be in room_4. Let me revise:

Actually, no, that's fine. The plan correctly accounts for the fact that after being picked up, blue_box_1 is no longer in room_4, but rather being carried by the agent. Then, at step 33, I drop blue_box_1 back in room_4, so it's again in room_4 for the goal.

Let me review the plan once more:

1. Start in room_3, go in front of green_ball_1 in room_3.
2. Pick up green_ball_1 (satisfying constraint 7).
3. Go in front of yellow_door_2.
4. Toggle yellow_door_2 to unlock it (satisfying part of constraint 9).
5. Enter room_1 (satisfying the other part of constraint 9).
6. Go to an empty position.
7. Drop green_ball_1.
8. Go in front of grey_box_1.
9. Pick up grey_box_1 (satisfying constraint 8).
10. Go in front of yellow_door_1.
11. Toggle yellow_door_1 to unlock it (satisfying constraint 11).
12. Enter room_2 (satisfying part of constraint 6).
13. Go to an empty position.
14. Drop grey_box_1.
15. Go back to room_1.
16. Go in front of red_box_1.
17. Pick up red_box_1 (for constraint 13).
18. Go back to room_2.
19. Go in front of green_door_1.
20. Toggle green_door_1 to unlock it (satisfying part of constraint 10).
21. Enter room_4 (satisfying constraint 3 and 4 since I'm holding red_box_1).
22. Go to an empty position.
23. Drop red_box_1.
24. Go in front of blue_box_1 (satisfying constraint 5).
25. Pick up blue_box_1 (satisfying constraint 1).
26. Go back to room_2.
27. Go back to room_1.
28. Go to room_3 (satisfying constraint 12).
29. (This satisfies constraint 13: I'm in room_3 and holding blue_box_1).
30. Go back to room_1.
31. Go back to room_2.
32. Go back to room_4.
33. Go to an empty position.
34. Drop blue_box_1.
35. Go in front of blue_box_1 (completing the goal).

The plan satisfies all constraints, so let's finalize the actions:

1. gotoobject green_ball_1 room_3
2. pick green_ball_1 room_3
3. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_3 room_1
4. toggle yellow_door_2
5. gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_2
6. gotoempty
7. drop green_ball_1 room_1
8. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_1
9. pick grey_box_1 room_1
10. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2
11. toggle yellow_door_1
12. gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1
13. gotoempty
14. drop grey_box_1 room_2
15. gotoroom room_2 room_1 yellow_door_1
16. gotoobject red_box_1 room_1
17. pick red_box_1 room_1
18. gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1
19. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4
20. toggle green_door_1
21. gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1
22. gotoempty
23. drop red_box_1 room_4
24. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_4
25. pick blue_box_1 room_4
26. gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_1
27. gotoroom room_2 room_1 yellow_door_1
28. gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_2
29. gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_2
30. gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1
31. gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1
32. gotoempty
33. drop blue_box_1 room_4
34. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_4

This plan seems optimal and satisfies all constraints.

Actually, let me go through the constraints one more time to make sure I've understood them correctly:

1. ✅ At some point, you must be holding blue_box_1. (Step 25)
2. ✅ grey_door_1 is always locked. (I never toggle it)
3. ✅ At some point, you must be in room_4. (Step 21)
4. ✅ Before being in room_4, you must have held some object. (I'm holding red_box_1 at step 21)
5. ✅ At some point, you must be in front of blue_box_1. (Step 24 and 34)
6. ✅ Before being in front of blue_box_1, you must have been in room_2. (Step 12)
7. ✅ At some point, you must be holding green_ball_1. (Step 2)
8. ✅ At some point, you must be holding grey_box_1. (Step 9)
9. ✅ At some point, either you are in room_1 or yellow_door_2 is unlocked. (Step 5)
10. ✅ At some point, either you are holding yellow_box_1 or green_door_1 is unlocked. (Step 20)
11. ✅ At some point, yellow_door_1 must be unlocked. (Step 11)
12. ✅ At some point, you must be in room_3. (We start in room_3 and go back in step 28)
13. ✅ If you are in room_3, you must hold red_box_1 at that point or afterward. (We pick up red_box_1 in step 17 and hold it until at least step 23)

I had a question about constraint 13: "If you are in room_3, you must hold red_box_1 at that point or afterward." But I'm worried that this is not satisfied for the initial state, where the agent is in room_3 but doesn't hold red_box_1 immediately (and, in fact, drops it in step 23).

But on second thought, the constraint says "at that point or afterward." So if the agent is in room_3 at the start, it means at some point afterward, the agent must hold red_box_1, which is satisfied by step 17.

But wait, there's another issue: In step 28, the agent goes back to room_3, but at this point, the agent is holding blue_box_1, not red_box_1. So the constraint is not satisfied for this instance of being in room_3.

Let me reconsider constraint 13: "If you are in room_3, you must hold red_box_1 at that point or afterward." This constraint is like a trigger: whenever the agent is in room_3, it must make sure to hold red_box_1 at that moment or at some future moment.

So for the initial state, the agent must pick up red_box_1 at some point, which is satisfied by step 17.

But for step 28, where the agent re-enters room_3, the constraint triggers again, and the agent must pick up red_box_1 after this point. Currently, in my plan, the agent never holds red_box_1 after step 28, so the constraint is violated.

Let's fix this. The agent is in room_3 at step 28, so it must hold red_box_1 at that point or later. But the agent already dropped red_box_1 in room_4. So, the agent needs to pick up red_box_1 again.

Actually, let me reinterpret constraint 13. It says: "If expression 'you are in room_3' holds in some state s, then expression 'you are holding red_box_1' must hold at s or at some state after s."

So for each state where the agent is in room_3, there must be a state (either the same or a later one) where the agent is holding red_box_1.

In the initial state, the agent is in room_3. The agent holds red_box_1 in step 17, which is after the initial state. So the constraint is satisfied for the initial state.

In step 28, the agent is again in room_3. But the agent doesn't hold red_box_1 after step 28 in my current plan, so the constraint is violated for this state.

Let me adjust the plan:

1. gotoobject green_ball_1 room_3
2. pick green_ball_1 room_3
3. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_3 room_1
4. toggle yellow_door_2
5. gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_2
6. gotoempty
7. drop green_ball_1 room_1
8. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_1
9. pick grey_box_1 room_1
10. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2
11. toggle yellow_door_1
12. gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1
13. gotoempty
14. drop grey_box_1 room_2
15. gotoroom room_2 room_1 yellow_door_1
16. gotoobject red_box_1 room_1
17. pick red_box_1 room_1
18. gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1
19. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4
20. toggle green_door_1
21. gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1
22. gotoempty
23. drop red_box_1 room_4
24. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_4
25. pick blue_box_1 room_4
26. gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_1
27. gotoroom room_2 room_1 yellow_door_1
28. gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_2

Now the agent is in room_3 holding blue_box_1, which doesn't satisfy constraint 13. I need to ensure the agent holds red_box_1 after being in room_3.

I could go back to room_4, drop blue_box_1, pick up red_box_1, and continue. But that complicates the plan.

Actually, on further thought, there's a simpler interpretation of constraint 13: it doesn't care about each time the agent is in room_3. The constraint is satisfied as long as for any state where the agent is in room_3, there exists a state (the same or later) where the agent holds red_box_1. So it's sufficient to have one state where the agent holds red_box_1 after the start (since the agent starts in room_3).

Let's go with this interpretation, which means my original plan satisfies the constraint.

Actually, we're overthinking this. Let me read the constraint one more time:

"If expression 'you are in room_3' holds in some state s, then expression 'you are holding red_box_1' must hold at s or at some state after s."

This constraint says: If you're in room_3 at some point, then at that point or later, you must hold red_box_1.

In the initial state, the agent is in room_3. The agent holds red_box_1 in step 17, which is after the initial state. So the constraint is satisfied for the initial state.

In step 28, the agent is again in room_3. The constraint is triggered again, which means the agent must hold red_box_1 at that point or later. But my plan doesn't have the agent hold red_box_1 after step 28, so the constraint is violated for this state.

Alright, let me rework the end of the plan:

28. gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_2
29. gotoempty
30. drop blue_box_1 room_3
31. gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_2
32. gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1
33. gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1
34. gotoobject red_box_1 room_4
35. pick red_box_1 room_4
36. gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_1
37. gotoroom room_2 room_1 yellow_door_1
38. gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_2 (Now the agent is in room_3 and holding red_box_1, satisfying constraint 13 for step 28)
39. gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_2
40. gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1
41. gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1
42. gotoempty
43. drop red_box_1 room_4
44. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_3
45. pick blue_box_1 room_3
46. gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_2
47. gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1
48. gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1
49. gotoempty
50. drop blue_box_1 room_4
51. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_4

But I realize there's a problem at step 44: blue_box_1 is in room_3 now, not room_4. Also, this plan is getting quite long, and there might be more efficient ways to satisfy the constraints.

Actually, I was mistaken in leaving the blue_box_1 in room_3. Let me reobserve my steps, keeping the objects in the correct rooms:

1. We start with blue_box_1 in room_4.
2. In step 25, the agent picks up blue_box_1 in room_4.
3. The agent travels to room_3, holding blue_box_1.
4. If the agent drops blue_box_1 in room_3, then blue_box_1 is now in room_3, not room_4.
5. But the goal is to have blue_box_1 in room_4 at the end.

So the agent should not drop blue_box_1 in room_3. Instead, it should carry blue_box_1 back to room_4, drop it there, and complete the goal.

And the constraint 13 issue still needs to be addressed. Let me rethink this:

At step 28, the agent is in room_3 holding blue_box_1. The constraint requires the agent to hold red_box_1 at that point or later.

So the agent needs to go back to room_4, drop blue_box_1, pick up red_box_1, possibly bring it somewhere, and then get back to room_4 to pick up blue_box_1 again and complete the goal.

This is getting complex.

Let me try a different approach. Let's start with a simpler plan that doesn't go to room_3 a second time, avoiding the triggering of constraint 13 again:

1. gotoobject green_ball_1 room_3
2. pick green_ball_1 room_3
3. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_3 room_1
4. toggle yellow_door_2
5. gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_2
6. gotoempty
7. drop green_ball_1 room_1
8. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_1
9. pick grey_box_1 room_1
10. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2
11. toggle yellow_door_1
12. gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1
13. gotoempty
14. drop grey_box_1 room_2
15. gotoroom room_2 room_1 yellow_door_1
16. gotoobject red_box_1 room_1
17. pick red_box_1 room_1
18. gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1
19. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4
20. toggle green_door_1
21. gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1
22. gotoempty
23. drop red_box_1 room_4
24. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_4
25. pick blue_box_1 room_4
26. gotoempty
27. drop blue_box_1 room_4
28. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_4

But this isn't satisfying constraints 9, 10, 11, and 12, because they're specific to actions, not just to the final state.

Actually, I'm not sure if I need to go back to room_3 a second time for constraint 12. The constraint just says the agent needs to be in room_3 at some point, which is satisfied from the start. Let's stick with that interpretation and check the constraints for my simpler plan:

1. ✅ At some point, you must be holding blue_box_1. (Step 25)
2. ✅ grey_door_1 is always locked. (I never toggle it)
3. ✅ At some point, you must be in room_4. (Step 21)
4. ✅ Before being in room_4, you must have held some object. (I'm holding red_box_1 at step 21)
5. ✅ At some point, you must be in front of blue_box_1. (Step 24 and 28)
6. ✅ Before being in front of blue_box_1, you must have been in room_2. (Step 12)
7. ✅ At some point, you must be holding green_ball_1. (Step 2)
8. ✅ At some point, you must be holding grey_box_1. (Step 9)
9. ✅ At some point, either you are in room_1 or yellow_door_2 is unlocked. (Step 5 and 4)
10. ✅ At some point, either you are holding yellow_box_1 or green_door_1 is unlocked. (Step 20)
11. ✅ At some point, yellow_door_1 must be unlocked. (Step 11)
12. ✅ At some point, you must be in room_3. (We start in room_3)
13. ✅ If you are in room_3, you must hold red_box_1 at that point or afterward. (We pick up red_box_1 in step 17, which is after the start)

But wait, the constraint on not being able to reenter room_3 feels strange, just because the agent starts in room_3. Let me reconsider this constraint.

Actually, constraint 12 just says the agent needs to be in room_3 at some point, which is satisfied from the start. We don't need to revisit room_3 for this constraint.

And for constraint 13, it says: "If expression 'you are in room_3' holds in some state s, then expression 'you are holding red_box_1' must hold at s or at some state after s."

Since the agent is in room_3 at the start, it means the agent must hold red_box_1 at some point, which is satisfied by step 17. The constraint doesn't necessarily mean the agent must hold red_box_1 after every instance of being in room_3, just that for each time the agent is in room_3, there must be a corresponding state (the same or later) where the agent holds red_box_1.

So if the agent doesn't revisit room_3, the constraint is satisfied.

In conclusion, I believe the simpler plan is valid:

1. gotoobject green_ball_1 room_3
2. pick green_ball_1 room_3
3. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_3 room_1
4. toggle yellow_door_2
5. gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_2
6. gotoempty
7. drop green_ball_1 room_1
8. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_1
9. pick grey_box_1 room_1
10. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2
11. toggle yellow_door_1
12. gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1
13. gotoempty
14. drop grey_box_1 room_2
15. gotoroom room_2 room_1 yellow_door_1
16. gotoobject red_box_1 room_1
17. pick red_box_1 room_1
18. gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1
19. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4
20. toggle green_door_1
21. gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1
22. gotoempty
23. drop red_box_1 room_4
24. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_4
25. pick blue_box_1 room_4
26. gotoempty
27. drop blue_box_1 room_4
28. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_4

This plan is optimal for the given constraints.

But actually, I'm realizing I might be overthinking this. Let me approach this more systematically:

1. Start in room_3.
2. Pick up some objects in room_3 to satisfy the constraints that require the agent to hold them.
3. Unlock the necessary doors to navigate the gridworld.
4. Get to room_2 (required before going to room_4 and being in front of blue_box_1).
5. Go to room_4, find blue_box_1, and complete the goal.

For constraint 10, either the agent holds yellow_box_1 or green_door_1 is unlocked. We need to unlock green_door_1 to get to room_4 anyway, so that satisfies the constraint.

For constraint 13, if the agent is in room_3, it must hold red_box_1 at that point or afterward. Since the agent starts in room_3, it means the agent must hold red_box_1 at some point in the plan. We can handle this by having the agent pick up red_box_1 in room_1.

Let's refine the plan:

1. gotoobject green_ball_1 room_3
2. pick green_ball_1 room_3
3. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_3 room_1
4. toggle yellow_door_2
5. gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_2
6. gotoempty
7. drop green_ball_1 room_1
8. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_1
9. pick grey_box_1 room_1
10. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2
11. toggle yellow_door_1
12. gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1
13. gotoempty
14. drop grey_box_1 room_2
15. gotoroom room_2 room_1 yellow_door_1
16. gotoobject red_box_1 room_1
17. pick red_box_1 room_1
18. gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1
19. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4
20. toggle green_door_1
21. gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1
22. gotoempty
23. drop red_box_1 room_4
24. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_4
25. pick blue_box_1 room_4
26. gotoempty
27. drop blue_box_1 room_4
28. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_4

This plan seems optimal and satisfies all constraints.

Actually, I think this is overthinking. Let me simplify this once more and check the constraints:

1. ✅ At some point, you must be holding blue_box_1. (Step 25)
2. ✅ grey_door_1 is always locked. (I never toggle it)
3. ✅ At some point, you must be in room_4. (Step 21)
4. ✅ Before being in room_4, you must have held some object. (I'm holding red_box_1 at step 21)
5. ✅ At some point, you must be in front of blue_box_1. (Step 24 and 28)
6. ✅ Before being in front of blue_box_1, you must have been in room_2. (Step 12)
7. ✅ At some point, you must be holding green_ball_1. (Step 2)
8. ✅ At some point, you must be holding grey_box_1. (Step 9)
9. ✅ At some point, either you are in room_1 or yellow_door_2 is unlocked. (Step 5 and 4)
10. ✅ At some point, either you are holding yellow_box_1 or green_door_1 is unlocked. (Step 20)
11. ✅ At some point, yellow_door_1 must be unlocked. (Step 11)
12. ✅ At some point, you must be in room_3. (We start in room_3)
13. ✅ If you are in room_3, you must hold red_box_1 at that point or afterward. (We pick up red_box_1 in step 17, which is after the start)

The plan satisfies all constraints. It is valid and optimal.
