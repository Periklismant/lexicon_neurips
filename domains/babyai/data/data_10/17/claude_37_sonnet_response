Alright, I need to understand the planning problem and address each of the constraints to develop a valid plan. Let me break down the initial state, the goal, and the constraints.

Initial State:
- You are in room_4
- Boxes and balls are distributed across rooms as stated
- All doors are locked
- You are not holding any object
- You have visited only room_4

Goal:
- Be in front of green_door_1 (which connects room_4 and room_2) and make sure it's unlocked

Constraints:
1. green_door_1 must be unlocked at some point
2. Before green_door_1 is unlocked, blue_box_1 must be in room_4
3. At some point, blue_box_2 must be in room_1 while you're holding some object
4. At some point, either you're holding blue_box_1 or purple_ball_1 is in room_2
5. green_door_1 must be locked at some point (already satisfied in the initial state)
6. If green_door_1 is locked at some state, you must be holding an object at that state or after
7. At some point, you must be holding grey_box_1
8. At some point, either you're in room_2 or you're holding purple_box_1
9. At some point, you must be holding some object
10. At some point, you must be in front of yellow_door_1
11. At some point, you must be in front of green_door_1
12. Before you're in front of green_door_1, you must have been holding some object
13. At some point, either empty is in room_2 or you're in front of purple_box_1

Now, let me think about a plan based on the goal and constraints:

1. We start in room_4 with all doors locked.
2. We need to unlock green_door_1, which connects room_4 and room_2.
3. Before unlocking green_door_1, we need to bring blue_box_1 to room_4 (constraint 2). But blue_box_1 is initially in room_3.
4. To get to room_3, we need to unlock grey_door_2, which connects room_4 and room_3.
5. We also need to fulfill other constraints, like being in front of yellow_door_1, holding grey_box_1, etc.

Let's outline a plan step by step:

1. In room_4, approach grey_door_2.
2. Unlock grey_door_2.
3. Go through the unlocked door to room_3.
4. In room_3, pick up blue_box_1.
5. Go back to room_4 through grey_door_2.
6. Drop blue_box_1 in room_4 (satisfying constraint 2).
7. Go back to room_3 through grey_door_2.
8. Pick up blue_box_2.
9. In room_3, approach yellow_door_1 (satisfying constraint 10).
10. Unlock yellow_door_1.
11. Go to room_1 through yellow_door_1.
12. Drop blue_box_2 in room_1 (satisfying constraint 3 as we're holding an object and blue_box_2 is in room_1).
13. In room_1, pick up grey_box_1 (satisfying constraint 7).
14. In room_1, approach grey_door_1.
15. Unlock grey_door_1.
16. Go to room_2 through grey_door_1 (satisfying constraint 8 as we're in room_2).
17. Drop grey_box_1 in room_2.
18. In room_2, approach green_door_1 (satisfying constraint 11).
19. Unlock green_door_1 (satisfying constraint 1).
20. We've now satisfied the goal: you're in front of green_door_1, which is unlocked.

Hmm, but we need to ensure all constraints are met.

- Constraint 4: Either hold blue_box_1 or have purple_ball_1 in room_2. We can handle this by either picking up blue_box_1 at some point or moving purple_ball_1 to room_2.
- Constraint 6: If green_door_1 is locked (which it is in the initial state), you must be holding an object at that state or after. This means we need to pick up an object at some point.
- Constraint 9: Must be holding some object at some point. This is satisfied as we pick up various objects.
- Constraint 12: Before being in front of green_door_1, must have held some object. Satisfied as we pick up objects earlier.
- Constraint 13: Either empty is in room_2 or you're in front of purple_box_1. I'm not sure what "empty is in room_2" means, but we can ensure we're in front of purple_box_1 at some point.

Actually, let me revise the plan to address all of these:

1. In room_4, approach grey_door_2.
2. Unlock grey_door_2.
3. Go through the unlocked door to room_3.
4. In room_3, approach purple_box_1 (satisfying constraint 13).
5. Pick up purple_box_1 (satisfying constraint 8, 9, and potentially 6).
6. In room_3, approach blue_box_1.
7. Drop purple_box_1 to free your hands.
8. Pick up blue_box_1 (satisfying constraint 4).
9. Go back to room_4 through grey_door_2.
10. Drop blue_box_1 in room_4 (satisfying constraint 2).
11. Go back to room_3 through grey_door_2.
12. Pick up blue_box_2.
13. In room_3, approach yellow_door_1 (satisfying constraint 10).
14. Unlock yellow_door_1.
15. Go to room_1 through yellow_door_1.
16. Drop blue_box_2 in room_1 (satisfying constraint 3).
17. In room_1, pick up grey_box_1 (satisfying constraint 7).
18. In room_1, approach grey_door_1.
19. Unlock grey_door_1.
20. Go to room_2 through grey_door_1 (satisfying constraint 8).
21. Drop grey_box_1 in room_2.
22. In room_2, approach green_door_1 (satisfying constraint 11).
23. Unlock green_door_1 (satisfying constraint 1).
24. We've now satisfied the goal: you're in front of green_door_1, which is unlocked.

Actually, I think there's a slight flaw in this plan. After we drop grey_box_1 in room_2 (step 21), we won't be holding any object when we approach green_door_1. This would violate constraint 12, which states that before we're in front of green_door_1, we must have been holding some object. Let me revise again:

1. In room_4, approach grey_door_2.
2. Unlock grey_door_2.
3. Go through the unlocked door to room_3.
4. In room_3, approach purple_box_1 (satisfying constraint 13).
5. Pick up purple_box_1 (satisfying constraint 8, 9, and potentially 6).
6. In room_3, approach blue_box_1.
7. Drop purple_box_1 to free your hands.
8. Pick up blue_box_1 (satisfying constraint 4).
9. Go back to room_4 through grey_door_2.
10. Drop blue_box_1 in room_4 (satisfying constraint 2).
11. Go back to room_3 through grey_door_2.
12. Pick up blue_box_2.
13. In room_3, approach yellow_door_1 (satisfying constraint 10).
14. Unlock yellow_door_1.
15. Go to room_1 through yellow_door_1.
16. Drop blue_box_2 in room_1 (satisfying constraint 3).
17. In room_1, pick up grey_box_1 (satisfying constraint 7).
18. In room_1, approach grey_door_1.
19. Unlock grey_door_1.
20. Go to room_2 through grey_door_1 (satisfying constraint 8).
21. In room_2, approach green_door_1 (satisfying constraint 11 and we're still holding grey_box_1, satisfying constraint 12).
22. Unlock green_door_1 (satisfying constraint 1).
23. Drop grey_box_1 in room_2.
24. We've now satisfied the goal: you're in front of green_door_1, which is unlocked.

But wait, after unlocking green_door_1, I'd no longer be in front of it, and I'd need to "gotoobject" again to be in front of green_door_1 for the goal.

Revising:

1. In room_4, approach grey_door_2.
2. Unlock grey_door_2.
3. Go through the unlocked door to room_3.
4. In room_3, approach purple_box_1 (satisfying constraint 13).
5. Pick up purple_box_1 (satisfying constraint 8, 9, and potentially 6).
6. In room_3, approach blue_box_1.
7. Drop purple_box_1 to free your hands.
8. Pick up blue_box_1 (satisfying constraint 4).
9. Go back to room_4 through grey_door_2.
10. Drop blue_box_1 in room_4 (satisfying constraint 2).
11. Go back to room_3 through grey_door_2.
12. Pick up blue_box_2.
13. In room_3, approach yellow_door_1 (satisfying constraint 10).
14. Unlock yellow_door_1.
15. Go to room_1 through yellow_door_1.
16. Drop blue_box_2 in room_1 (satisfying constraint 3).
17. In room_1, pick up grey_box_1 (satisfying constraint 7).
18. In room_1, approach grey_door_1.
19. Unlock grey_door_1.
20. Go to room_2 through grey_door_1 (satisfying constraint 8).
21. In room_2, approach green_door_1 (satisfying constraint 11 and we're still holding grey_box_1, satisfying constraint 12).
22. Unlock green_door_1 (satisfying constraint 1).
23. Go to room_4 through green_door_1 (to unlock it from the other side).
24. Drop grey_box_1 in room_4.
25. In room_4, approach green_door_1.
26. We've now satisfied the goal: you're in front of green_door_1, which is unlocked.

But wait, I think there's a hole in our plan again. We need to bring blue_box_1 to room_4 before unlocking green_door_1 (as per constraint 2). But after bringing blue_box_1 to room_4, we're planning to go back to room_3. However, we're not ensuring green_door_1 remains locked at that point.

So, the revised plan:

1. In room_4, approach grey_ball_1.
2. Pick up grey_ball_1 (satisfying constraint 9).
3. In room_4, approach grey_door_2.
4. Toggle grey_door_2 (unlocking it).
5. Go to room_3 through grey_door_2.
6. In room_3, approach purple_box_1 (satisfying constraint 13).
7. Drop grey_ball_1.
8. Pick up purple_box_1 (satisfying constraint 8).
9. In room_3, approach blue_box_1.
10. Drop purple_box_1.
11. Pick up blue_box_1 (satisfying constraint 4).
12. Go back to room_4 through grey_door_2.
13. Drop blue_box_1 in room_4 (satisfying constraint 2).
14. In room_4, approach green_door_1 (green_door_1 is still locked at this point, satisfying constraint 5).
15. Go back to room_3 through grey_door_2.
16. Pick up blue_box_2.
17. In room_3, approach yellow_door_1 (satisfying constraint 10).
18. Toggle yellow_door_1 (unlocking it).
19. Go to room_1 through yellow_door_1.
20. Drop blue_box_2 in room_1 (satisfying constraint 3 as we're holding blue_box_2 and it's in room_1).
21. In room_1, pick up grey_box_1 (satisfying constraint 7).
22. In room_1, approach grey_door_1.
23. Toggle grey_door_1 (unlocking it).
24. Go to room_2 through grey_door_1 (satisfying constraint 8 as we're in room_2).
25. In room_2, approach green_door_1 (satisfying constraint 11 and we're still holding grey_box_1, satisfying constraint 12).
26. Toggle green_door_1 (unlocking it, satisfying constraint 1).
27. We've now satisfied the goal: we're in front of green_door_1 (which connects room_2 and room_4), and it's unlocked.

I believe this plan covers all the constraints. Let me double-check:

1. ✓ green_door_1 must be unlocked at some point (step 26)
2. ✓ Before green_door_1 is unlocked, blue_box_1 must be in room_4 (step 13)
3. ✓ At some point, blue_box_2 must be in room_1 while you're holding some object (step 20)
4. ✓ At some point, either you're holding blue_box_1 or purple_ball_1 is in room_2 (step 11)
5. ✓ green_door_1 must be locked at some point (initial state and steps 1-25)
6. ✓ If green_door_1 is locked at some state, you must be holding an object at that state or after (multiple steps, including 2, 8, 11, etc.)
7. ✓ At some point, you must be holding grey_box_1 (step 21)
8. ✓ At some point, either you're in room_2 or you're holding purple_box_1 (step 8 and 24)
9. ✓ At some point, you must be holding some object (step 2, 8, 11, etc.)
10. ✓ At some point, you must be in front of yellow_door_1 (step 17)
11. ✓ At some point, you must be in front of green_door_1 (step 25)
12. ✓ Before you're in front of green_door_1, you must have been holding some object (step 21, you're holding grey_box_1)
13. ✓ At some point, either empty is in room_2 or you're in front of purple_box_1 (step 6)

This plan seems to satisfy all the constraints and achieve the goal. Let's double-check the detailed actions:

1. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_4
2. pick grey_ball_1 room_4
3. gotodoor grey_door_2 room_4 room_3
4. toggle grey_door_2
5. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_2
6. gotoobject purple_box_1 room_3
7. drop grey_ball_1 room_3
8. pick purple_box_1 room_3
9. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_3
10. drop purple_box_1 room_3
11. pick blue_box_1 room_3
12. gotoroom room_3 room_4 grey_door_2
13. drop blue_box_1 room_4
14. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2
15. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_2
16. gotoobject blue_box_2 room_3
17. pick blue_box_2 room_3
18. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1
19. toggle yellow_door_1
20. gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_1
21. drop blue_box_2 room_1
22. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_1
23. pick grey_box_1 room_1
24. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2
25. toggle grey_door_1
26. gotoroom room_1 room_2 grey_door_1
27. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4
28. toggle green_door_1

Actually, I think I misinterpreted an earlier constraint where it says "before you're in front of green_door_1, you must have been holding some object." I took this to mean that you must be holding an object immediately before being in front of green_door_1, but it actually means "at some point before being in front of green_door_1, you must have held an object."

Also, I just realized we might not be directly in front of green_door_1 after unlocking it, since toggling might change our position. Let's be safe and add a "gotodoor green_door_1" step after toggling it.

So the final plan is:

1. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_4
2. pick grey_ball_1 room_4
3. gotodoor grey_door_2 room_4 room_3
4. toggle grey_door_2
5. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_2
6. gotoobject purple_box_1 room_3
7. drop grey_ball_1 room_3
8. pick purple_box_1 room_3
9. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_3
10. drop purple_box_1 room_3
11. pick blue_box_1 room_3
12. gotoroom room_3 room_4 grey_door_2
13. drop blue_box_1 room_4
14. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2
15. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_2
16. gotoobject blue_box_2 room_3
17. pick blue_box_2 room_3
18. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1
19. toggle yellow_door_1
20. gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_1
21. drop blue_box_2 room_1
22. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_1
23. pick grey_box_1 room_1
24. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2
25. toggle grey_door_1
26. gotoroom room_1 room_2 grey_door_1
27. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4
28. toggle green_door_1
29. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4

Checking the final goal:
- We're in front of green_door_1, which connects room_2 and room_4
- green_door_1 is unlocked

Yes, all conditions are met. This is the final plan.

Actually, I think I mistakingly added a "gotodoor green_door_1" after toggling it. Let me check if this is necessary.

The effect of the "toggle" action is not that you're no longer in front of the door, so after toggling, we should still be in front of the door. Thus, step 29 is unnecessary.

Also, let me double check if we're satisfied in room_2 (not room_4). The goal says:

d is green", "room_4 and room_2 are connected via d", "you are in front of d", "d is not locked"

Here, d is green_door_1, which connects room_4 and room_2, and we need to be in front of it once it's not locked. So, we need to:
1. Be in room_2 or room_4
2. Be in front of green_door_1
3. Have green_door_1 be unlocked

From our plan, we're in room_2, in front of green_door_1, and green_door_1 is unlocked. So, the goal is achieved.

Let's double check the plan again:

1. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_4
2. pick grey_ball_1 room_4
3. gotodoor grey_door_2 room_4 room_3
4. toggle grey_door_2
5. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_2
6. gotoobject purple_box_1 room_3
7. drop grey_ball_1 room_3
8. pick purple_box_1 room_3
9. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_3
10. drop purple_box_1 room_3
11. pick blue_box_1 room_3
12. gotoroom room_3 room_4 grey_door_2
13. drop blue_box_1 room_4
14. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2
15. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_2
16. gotoobject blue_box_2 room_3
17. pick blue_box_2 room_3
18. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1
19. toggle yellow_door_1
20. gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_1
21. drop blue_box_2 room_1
22. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_1
23. pick grey_box_1 room_1
24. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2
25. toggle grey_door_1
26. gotoroom room_1 room_2 grey_door_1
27. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4
28. toggle green_door_1

Wait, I just realized we can't go from room_4 to room_3 through grey_door_2 in step 15 if green_door_1 is in front of us (step 14). We need a gotoempty step to move away from green_door_1:

1. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_4
2. pick grey_ball_1 room_4
3. gotodoor grey_door_2 room_4 room_3
4. toggle grey_door_2
5. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_2
6. gotoobject purple_box_1 room_3
7. drop grey_ball_1 room_3
8. pick purple_box_1 room_3
9. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_3
10. drop purple_box_1 room_3
11. pick blue_box_1 room_3
12. gotoroom room_3 room_4 grey_door_2
13. drop blue_box_1 room_4
14. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2
15. gotoempty
16. gotodoor grey_door_2 room_4 room_3
17. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_2
18. gotoobject blue_box_2 room_3
19. pick blue_box_2 room_3
20. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1
21. toggle yellow_door_1
22. gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_1
23. drop blue_box_2 room_1
24. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_1
25. pick grey_box_1 room_1
26. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2
27. toggle grey_door_1
28. gotoroom room_1 room_2 grey_door_1
29. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4
30. toggle green_door_1

That should be the final plan. Let me just review it to be extra certain:

1. ✓ gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_4 (we go to grey ball in room_4)
2. ✓ pick grey_ball_1 room_4 (we pick up the grey ball)
3. ✓ gotodoor grey_door_2 room_4 room_3 (we go to the grey door that connects room_4 and room_3)
4. ✓ toggle grey_door_2 (we unlock the grey door)
5. ✓ gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_2 (we go from room_4 to room_3 through the grey door)
6. ✓ gotoobject purple_box_1 room_3 (we go to the purple box in room_3)
7. ✓ drop grey_ball_1 room_3 (we drop the grey ball)
8. ✓ pick purple_box_1 room_3 (we pick up the purple box)
9. ✓ gotoobject blue_box_1 room_3 (we go to the blue box in room_3)
10. ✓ drop purple_box_1 room_3 (we drop the purple box)
11. ✓ pick blue_box_1 room_3 (we pick up the blue box)
12. ✓ gotoroom room_3 room_4 grey_door_2 (we go back to room_4)
13. ✓ drop blue_box_1 room_4 (we drop the blue box in room_4, satisfying the constraint that blue_box_1 must be in room_4 before unlocking green_door_1)
14. ✓ gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2 (we go to the green door that connects room_4 and room_2)
15. ✓ gotoempty (we move away from the green door)
16. ✓ gotodoor grey_door_2 room_4 room_3 (we go back to the grey door)
17. ✓ gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_2 (we go back to room_3)
18. ✓ gotoobject blue_box_2 room_3 (we go to the second blue box in room_3)
19. ✓ pick blue_box_2 room_3 (we pick up the second blue box)
20. ✓ gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1 (we go to the yellow door that connects room_3 and room_1)
21. ✓ toggle yellow_door_1 (we unlock the yellow door)
22. ✓ gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_1 (we go from room_3 to room_1 through the yellow door)
23. ✓ drop blue_box_2 room_1 (we drop the blue box in room_1, satisfying the constraint that blue_box_2 must be in room_1 while we're holding it)
24. ✓ gotoobject grey_box_1 room_1 (we go to the grey box in room_1)
25. ✓ pick grey_box_1 room_1 (we pick up the grey box, satisfying the constraint that we must hold grey_box_1 at some point)
26. ✓ gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2 (we go to the grey door that connects room_1 and room_2)
27. ✓ toggle grey_door_1 (we unlock the grey door)
28. ✓ gotoroom room_1 room_2 grey_door_1 (we go from room_1 to room_2 through the grey door, satisfying the constraint that we must be in room_2 at some point)
29. ✓ gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4 (we go to the green door from the room_2 side)
30. ✓ toggle green_door_1 (we unlock the green door, satisfying the constraint that green_door_1 must be unlocked at some point, and also achieving the goal)

I believe this final plan is valid, addresses all constraints, and achieves the goal. The plan ensures:
- blue_box_1 is in room_4 before unlocking green_door_1
- blue_box_2 is in room_1 while we're holding it
- We hold grey_box_1 at some point
- We're in room_2 at some point
- We're in front of yellow_door_1 at some point
- We're in front of green_door_1 at the end, and it's unlocked, achieving the goal

This is our final plan.

Actually, let's triple check:

1. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_4
2. pick grey_ball_1 room_4
3. gotodoor grey_door_2 room_4 room_3
4. toggle grey_door_2
5. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_2
6. gotoobject purple_box_1 room_3
7. drop grey_ball_1 room_3
8. pick purple_box_1 room_3
9. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_3
10. drop purple_box_1 room_3
11. pick blue_box_1 room_3
12. gotoroom room_3 room_4 grey_door_2
13. drop blue_box_1 room_4
14. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2
15. gotoempty
16. gotodoor grey_door_2 room_4 room_3
17. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_2
18. gotoobject blue_box_2 room_3
19. pick blue_box_2 room_3
20. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1
21. toggle yellow_door_1
22. gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_1
23. drop blue_box_2 room_1
24. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_1
25. pick grey_box_1 room_1
26. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2
27. toggle grey_door_1
28. gotoroom room_1 room_2 grey_door_1
29. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4
30. toggle green_door_1

Great, this final plan looks correct and addresses all constraints. Let me just make sure the plan flows logically and all actions are valid:

1. We start in room_4, so "gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_4" is a valid action.
2. We're now in front of grey_ball_1, so "pick grey_ball_1 room_4" is valid.
3. We're in room_4, so "gotodoor grey_door_2 room_4 room_3" is valid.

14. We're in room_4, so "gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2" is valid.
15. "gotoempty" is always valid.
16. We're in room_4, so "gotodoor grey_door_2 room_4 room_3" is valid.
17. grey_door_2 is unlocked, so "gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_2" is valid.
18. We're in room_3, so "gotoobject blue_box_2 room_3" is valid.

20. We're in room_3, so "gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1" is valid.
21. We're in front of yellow_door_1, so "toggle yellow_door_1" is valid.
22. yellow_door_1 is now unlocked, so "gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_1" is valid.
23. We're holding blue_box_2, so "drop blue_box_2 room_1" is valid.
24. We're in room_1, so "gotoobject grey_box_1 room_1" is valid.

29. We're in room_2, so "gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4" is valid.
30. We're in front of green_door_1, so "toggle green_door_1" is valid.

We've now unlocked green_door_1 and we're in front of it in room_2, which is the goal of the problem. And all the steps flow logically, one after the other. So again, the final plan is:

1. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_4
2. pick grey_ball_1 room_4
3. gotodoor grey_door_2 room_4 room_3
4. toggle grey_door_2
5. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_2
6. gotoobject purple_box_1 room_3
7. drop grey_ball_1 room_3
8. pick purple_box_1 room_3
9. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_3
10. drop purple_box_1 room_3
11. pick blue_box_1 room_3
12. gotoroom room_3 room_4 grey_door_2
13. drop blue_box_1 room_4
14. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2
15. gotoempty
16. gotodoor grey_door_2 room_4 room_3
17. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_2
18. gotoobject blue_box_2 room_3
19. pick blue_box_2 room_3
20. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1
21. toggle yellow_door_1
22. gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_1
23. drop blue_box_2 room_1
24. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_1
25. pick grey_box_1 room_1
26. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2
27. toggle grey_door_1
28. gotoroom room_1 room_2 grey_door_1
29. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4
30. toggle green_door_1
