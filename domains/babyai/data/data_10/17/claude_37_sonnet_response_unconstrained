Let's analyze the problem step by step.

Initial state:
- I am in room_4
- There are various boxes and balls distributed across the rooms
- All doors (grey_door_1, yellow_door_1, green_door_1, grey_door_2) are locked
- I am not holding any object
- I have visited room_4

Goal:
- I need to be in front of a green door (green_door_1)
- This door connects room_4 and room_2
- The door needs to be unlocked
- I need to be in front of this door

Let's identify the green door that connects room_4 and room_2:
- In the initial state, it says "room_4 and room_2 are connected via green_door_1" and "green_door_1 is green"
- So the door I need to unlock and be in front of is green_door_1

Let's break down the steps to achieve this goal:
1. I'm in room_4 initially
2. I need to go to the door green_door_1 which connects room_4 and room_2
3. I need to unlock (toggle) the door
4. After that, I need to make sure I'm in front of the door

Let's plan the sequence of actions:

1. I need to go in front of green_door_1 from room_4
   - Action: gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2
   
2. I need to unlock (toggle) green_door_1
   - Action: toggle green_door_1
   
Let me check if this plan works:

1. Initial state: I'm in room_4, all doors are locked.
2. I go in front of green_door_1 using "gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2"
3. Now I'm in front of green_door_1 in room_4
4. I toggle green_door_1 using "toggle green_door_1"
5. Now green_door_1 is unlocked, and I'm still in front of it

This satisfies all the goal conditions:
- I'm in front of a door d (green_door_1)
- d is green (green_door_1 is green)
- room_4 and room_2 are connected via d (given in the initial state)
- d is not locked (I toggled it)

So the plan is:
1. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2
2. toggle green_door_1

Let me double-check if this plan is valid and satisfies all constraints:

- "gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2" preconditions:
  - I'm in room_4, which is connected to room_2 via green_door_1 ✓
  - No object is blocking the door (not mentioned in the initial state, so assumed to be true) ✓

- "toggle green_door_1" preconditions:
  - I'm in front of green_door_1 (after the previous action) ✓

- After the sequence:
  - green_door_1 is unlocked ✓
  - I'm in front of green_door_1 ✓
  - green_door_1 is green ✓
  - room_4 and room_2 are connected via green_door_1 ✓

This plan fulfills the goal conditions and satisfies all constraints. Let's provide the final plan:

```
gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2
toggle green_door_1
```

Actually, let me carefully re-check the action definitions to make sure my understanding is correct.

"gotodoor d r1 r2": Go in front of door d, connecting room r1 to room r2.
Preconditions:
- I may only go in front of a door d if (i) I am in a room which door d is connecting with another room, and (ii) there is no object blocking the position in front of d in the room I am currently in.

Effects:
- After performing this action regarding a door d, (i) if I was in front of some object or door x0, then I am no longer in front of x0 and (ii) I am in front of door d.

"toggle d": Unlock door d if is locked. Lock door d if is unlocked.
Preconditions:
- I may only toggle a door d if I am in front of d.

Effects:
- After performing this action on a door d, (i) if d was locked, then it becomes unlocked, and (ii) if d was unlocked, then it becomes locked.

So my plan is correct. Starting in room_4, I go in front of green_door_1 (which connects room_4 and room_2), and then I toggle it to unlock it. At the end, I'm in front of an unlocked green door that connects room_4 and room_2, which fulfills the goal.

The final plan is:
```
gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2
toggle green_door_1
```
