Okay, let's tackle this planning problem step by step. The goal is to get to a green door that connects room_4 and room_2, be in front of it, and have it unlocked. Let me first understand the initial state and the constraints.

Starting in room_4. The doors are all locked initially. The green door is green_door_1, which connects room_2 and room_4. So the target door is green_door_1. We need to be in front of it in room_4 or room_2, but since we start in room_4, maybe we can go to that door from room_4.

But first, all doors are locked. So to unlock green_door_1, we need to toggle it. But to toggle a door, we have to be in front of it. However, doors are locked, so we can't go through them. Wait, the "gotodoor d r1 r2" action requires that there's no object blocking the position in front of d in the current room. So maybe even if the door is locked, we can go in front of it as long as there's nothing blocking. But the problem is, to get to the door, do we need to be in the room where the door is? For example, green_door_1 connects room_2 and room_4. So if we're in room_4, can we go to green_door_1? Let me check the preconditions of "gotodoor d r1 r2". The precondition is (i) you are in a room which door d is connecting with another room, and (ii) no object is blocking the position in front of d. So since green_door_1 connects room_4 and room_2, if we're in room_4, we can go to green_door_1, provided nothing is blocking it.

But in room_4, what's blocking? The initial state says that grey_ball_1 and grey_box_2 are in room_4. Are they blocking the door? Wait, the problem states that objects (boxes and balls) can block doors. Wait, the effect of picking up an object x is that if x was blocking a door, then it's no longer blocking. So maybe in the initial state, some objects are blocking doors. But the initial state description doesn't mention any objects blocking doors. Wait, the original state doesn't state any objects blocking doors. So perhaps none are blocking. Therefore, we can go to green_door_1 from room_4.

So the steps would be: from room_4, go to green_door_1 (gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2). Then toggle it to unlock. Then the door is unlocked, and we need to be in front of it. But the goal requires being in front of d (green_door_1) and d is not locked. So after unlocking, we just need to stay in front of it. But wait, after toggling, does the door become unlocked? Yes. So the plan would be:

1. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2 (since we're in room_4, and the door connects room_4 and room_2)
2. toggle green_door_1 (unlock it)
3. Now, after toggling, the door is unlocked. The goal requires that the door is not locked and we are in front of it. So after step 2, we are already in front of the door (since we just toggled it), so maybe that's sufficient. But need to check the goal conditions.

Wait the goal is: there exists a door d that is green, connects room_4 and room_2, you are in front of d, and d is not locked. So after steps 1 and 2, we have done that. But wait, after the toggle action, are we still in front of the door? Because the effect of toggle is just changing the door's state, not moving us. So after gotodoor and toggle, we are still in front of green_door_1. So that would satisfy the goal. So the plan is just those two actions.

But wait, the initial state says that all doors are locked, including green_door_1. So yes, we need to toggle it. So the steps would be:

gotoempty (to get in front of an empty spot, maybe not necessary if we're already in front of nothing). Wait, initially, the agent is in room_4 but not in front of any object or door. Wait, the initial state doesn't mention the agent's position in front of anything, so maybe they start in front of nothing. So the first action is to go to the door. So the plan would be:

1. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2
2. toggle green_door_1

But wait, in the initial state, green_door_1 is locked. So after toggling, it becomes unlocked. So this would satisfy the goal: d is green (green_door_1), connects room_4 and room_2, you are in front of it, and it's unlocked. So that's two actions. Is that correct?

But wait, the preconditions for gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2. Are we allowed to do that? Because we are in room_4, which is connected via green_door_1 to room_2. So condition (i) is satisfied. And (ii) no object is blocking the position in front of the door in room_4. Since the initial state doesn't mention any objects blocking doors, we can assume that there's nothing blocking. Therefore, gotodoor is possible.

So the plan is:

```
gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2
toggle green_door_1
```

But let's check for any constraints. The problem mentions constraints, but the user hasn't listed them here. Wait, the original problem states "A valid plan for the abovementioned problem must abide by the following constraints:" but then there's nothing. Maybe a formatting error. But assuming there are no additional constraints beyond the action preconditions, this plan should work.

Wait, the user might have forgotten to paste the constraints. Let me check again. The original problem says "A valid plan for the abovementioned problem must abide by the following constraints:" but then nothing. So perhaps the constraints are part of the problem but were not included here. Wait, looking back, the user's input includes "Provided a planning problem, consisting of an initial state of the world, a final goal and a set of constraints...". So the constraints are part of the problem. But in the problem statement provided, the constraints section is empty. That's probably a mistake. But since the user hasn't provided them, I have to proceed without knowing them, which is impossible. But in the actual problem, maybe the constraints are present. Wait, looking back at the user's message, after the task description, they have a section "The task is to bring about..." and then "A valid plan for the abovementioned problem must abide by the following constraints:", but there's no content after that. So perhaps it's a formatting error. Alternatively, maybe the constraints are part of the problem but were omitted. But without knowing the constraints, it's hard to proceed. However, given that the user is asking for the plan, perhaps the constraints are not present, and the only constraints are the action preconditions. So proceeding under that assumption.

Therefore, the minimal plan is two actions: go to the green door and toggle it. That satisfies the goal.
