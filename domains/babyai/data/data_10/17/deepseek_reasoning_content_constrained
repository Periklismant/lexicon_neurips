Okay, let's tackle this planning problem step by step. The goal is to get to a situation where there's a green door (d) connecting room_4 and room_2, I'm in front of it, and it's unlocked. From the initial state, the doors are all locked, so I need to unlock them. But there are a bunch of constraints to satisfy along the way. Let's break it down.

First, the initial state: I'm in room_4. The green_door_1 connects room_2 and room_4, and it's locked. The goal requires this door to be unlocked and me in front of it. So the final action should probably be toggling green_door_1 after unlocking it. But to unlock a door, I need to be in front of it, which requires going there. However, doors are locked initially, so I need to find a way to get through other doors to reach green_door_1.

Wait, the doors are all locked. So how do I move between rooms initially? Let's see the connections. The doors are grey_door_1 (room_1-room_2), yellow_door_1 (room_1-room_3), green_door_1 (room_2-room_4), and grey_door_2 (room_3-room_4). All are locked. So starting in room_4, I can't go to room_2 or room_3 unless those doors are unlocked. But how can I unlock them if I can't reach them?

Wait, the toggle action can unlock a door if I'm in front of it. But to get in front of a door, I need to be in a room that the door connects. For example, to get to green_door_1, I need to be in room_4 or room_2. Since I'm in room_4 initially, maybe I can go to the green_door_1 from room_4, but if the door is locked, can I still go in front of it? The "goto door" action's preconditions say that I can go in front of door d if I'm in a room connected by d and there's no object blocking the position. So even if the door is locked, I can go in front of it, right? Because the door being locked doesn't block the position in front of it unless there's an object there. But the problem is that toggling the door requires being in front of it, which I can do even if it's locked. Wait, the "toggle" action's precondition is that I'm in front of the door. So perhaps the plan is:

1. In room_4, go to green_door_1 (since room_4 and room_2 are connected via green_door_1). So use gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2. But wait, the syntax is "gotodoor d r1 r2". So in room_4, the door connects room_4 and room_2, so the correct command would be gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2. Then toggle it to unlock. But initially, green_door_1 is locked. But after toggling, it becomes unlocked. Then, I can use gotoroom to move from room_4 to room_2 via green_door_1. Wait, but the goal is to have green_door_1 unlocked and be in front of it. But after unlocking it, I can just stay in front of it. However, the constraints require that when green_door_1 is unlocked, there must have been a prior state where blue_box_1 is in room_4. So I need to move blue_box_1 to room_4 at some point.

Wait, let's list all constraints:

Constraints:

1. At some state, green_door_1 is not locked. (Which is part of the goal, but also required as a constraint.)

2. If green_door_1 is not locked in any state, then there's an earlier state where blue_box_1 is in room_4.

3. At some state: blue_box_2 is in room_1 and I'm holding something.

4. At some state: either I'm holding blue_box_1 or purple_ball_1 is in room_2.

5. At some state: green_door_1 is locked.

6. If green_door_1 is locked in state s, then I'm holding something in s or after.

7. At some state: holding grey_box_1.

8. At some state: either in room_2 or holding purple_box_1.

9. At some state: holding some object.

10. At some state: in front of yellow_door_1.

11. At some state: in front of green_door_1 (which is part of the goal).

12. If in front of green_door_1 in some state, then earlier state where I was holding something.

13. At some state: either empty is in room_2 (which is always true since "empty_0" is an object? Or maybe a position is empty?) or in front of purple_box_1.

Hmm, this is complex. Let's start by considering the main goal and then see how to satisfy the constraints.

Main goal: There exists a door d that is green, connects room_4 and room_2, I'm in front of d, and d is unlocked. The only green door is green_door_1, which connects room_2 and room_4. So the goal is to be in front of green_door_1, which is unlocked.

So steps needed:

1. Unlock green_door_1.

To unlock it, I need to toggle it, which requires being in front of it. Since I'm in room_4 initially, I can go to green_door_1 from room_4, then toggle it. But wait, green_door_1 is in room_4's connection to room_2. So in room_4, I can use "gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2". Then "toggle green_door_1" to unlock it. However, the initial state says green_door_1 is locked. So toggling it would unlock it. Then, the goal would be satisfied if I'm in front of it and it's unlocked. But the goal requires that "d is not locked" and I'm in front of d. So after toggling, the door is unlocked, and I'm in front of it. So the plan could be:

- gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2

- toggle green_door_1

But wait, the problem is that after toggling, the door is unlocked. However, this would satisfy the goal. But we need to check the constraints.

But let's check constraints. For example, constraint 2 says that if green_door_1 is not locked in some state, then earlier state where blue_box_1 is in room_4. So before unlocking green_door_1, we need to have blue_box_1 in room_4.

Blue_box_1 is initially in room_3. So I need to move it to room_4. But how?

To move blue_box_1 to room_4, I need to pick it up from room_3 and drop it in room_4. But to get to room_3 from room_4, I need to go through grey_door_2 (connecting room_3 and room_4), which is locked. So I need to unlock grey_door_2 first.

But to unlock grey_door_2, I need to be in front of it. Since I'm in room_4, I can go to grey_door_2 (which connects room_4 and room_3). So:

- gotodoor grey_door_2 room_4 room_3

- toggle grey_door_2 (unlock it)

Then, use gotoroom to go to room_3.

But then, in room_3, I can pick up blue_box_1. But to pick up an object, I need to be in the same room and not holding anything. So:

After unlocking grey_door_2:

- gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_2

- gotoobject blue_box_1 room_3

- pick blue_box_1 room_3

Then, return to room_4:

- gotodoor grey_door_2 room_3 room_4 (or just use gotoroom back?)

Wait, after being in room_3, to go back to room_4 via grey_door_2 (now unlocked), so:

- gotodoor grey_door_2 room_3 room_4

Wait, the gotoroom action is "gotoroom r1 r2 d", so to go from room_3 to room_4 via grey_door_2:

- gotoroom room_3 room_4 grey_door_2

But before that, I need to be in front of the door. So perhaps:

In room_3:

- gotodoor grey_door_2 room_3 room_4

- gotoroom room_3 room_4 grey_door_2

Then in room_4, drop the blue_box_1:

- gotoempty (to be in front of empty spot)

- drop blue_box_1 room_4

This way, blue_box_1 is now in room_4. So this satisfies constraint 2 when later we unlock green_door_1.

But let's track the steps so far:

1. gotodoor grey_door_2 room_4 room_3

2. toggle grey_door_2 (unlocking it)

3. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_2 (now in room_3)

4. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_3

5. pick blue_box_1 room_3

6. gotodoor grey_door_2 room_3 room_4

7. gotoroom room_3 room_4 grey_door_2 (back to room_4)

8. gotoempty

9. drop blue_box_1 room_4

Now, blue_box_1 is in room_4. Then, proceed to unlock green_door_1:

10. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2

11. toggle green_door_1 (unlocking it)

Now, after step 11, green_door_1 is unlocked, and I'm in front of it. This satisfies the goal. But also, when we toggle green_door_1 (step 11), the constraint 2 is satisfied because step 9 had blue_box_1 in room_4.

But wait, in step 9, blue_box_1 is dropped in room_4. So the state after step 9 has blue_box_1 in room_4. Then step 11 toggles green_door_1 to unlocked, which requires that before step 11, blue_box_1 was in room_4. So that's satisfied.

But there are other constraints to handle. Let's check them one by one.

Constraint 3: At some state, blue_box_2 is in room_1 and I'm holding some object. Blue_box_2 is initially in room_3. So I need to move it to room_1. But room_1 is connected via yellow_door_1 to room_3. But yellow_door_1 is locked. So I need to unlock yellow_door_1. To unlock it, I need to be in front of it. To get to room_1, I can go from room_3 via yellow_door_1, but that's locked. So steps:

From room_3, after picking blue_box_1, but before returning to room_4, maybe I should handle moving blue_box_2 to room_1. Wait, but this is getting complicated. Let's see.

Alternatively, after unlocking grey_door_2 and getting blue_box_1 to room_4, maybe I can proceed to unlock other doors.

But let's think about the constraints step by step.

Constraint 7: At some state, holding grey_box_1. Grey_box_1 is in room_1. So I need to go to room_1, pick it up. But how? To get to room_1, from room_4, I can go through room_3, then room_1 via yellow_door_1. But yellow_door_1 is locked, so need to unlock it. Let's see.

Alternatively, from room_4, maybe go to room_2 via green_door_1 (after unlocking it), but green_door_1 is locked initially. Wait, but after step 11, green_door_1 is unlocked. So after step 11, I can go to room_2. Then from room_2, go to room_1 via grey_door_1, which is locked. So I need to unlock grey_door_1.

This is getting too complex. Maybe there's a more optimal path.

Alternatively, perhaps after moving blue_box_1 to room_4, I need to handle other constraints. For example, constraint 3 requires blue_box_2 in room_1 while I'm holding something. So I need to carry blue_box_2 to room_1. But blue_box_2 is in room_3. So steps:

After dropping blue_box_1 in room_4 (step 9), go back to room_3 via grey_door_2 (which is unlocked), pick up blue_box_2, then take it to room_1. But how to get to room_1? From room_3, I can use yellow_door_1 to room_1, but it's locked. So I need to unlock yellow_door_1.

To unlock yellow_door_1, I need to be in front of it. So from room_3, go to yellow_door_1 (connecting room_3 and room_1), gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1, then toggle it. But since I'm in room_3, I can go to yellow_door_1, toggle it to unlock, then go to room_1.

So steps after step 9:

10. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_2 (back to room_3)

11. gotoobject blue_box_2 room_3

12. pick blue_box_2 room_3 (now holding it)

13. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1

14. toggle yellow_door_1 (unlocking it)

15. gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_1 (now in room_1)

16. drop blue_box_2 room_1 (now blue_box_2 is in room_1)

But during step 12, I'm holding blue_box_2. So constraint 3 is satisfied when blue_box_2 is in room_1 and I'm holding it (but wait, when I drop it, I'm no longer holding it. So the state where blue_box_2 is in room_1 and I'm holding something would be during step 15 (when I'm in room_1, still holding blue_box_2 before dropping). Or perhaps after dropping, but that doesn't satisfy the holding part. So maybe during step 15, before dropping, in room_1, I'm holding blue_box_2, and blue_box_2 is in room_1 (but only after dropping). Wait, no. When I pick up blue_box_2 in room_3, it's no longer in room_3. Then, after moving to room_1 and dropping, it's in room_1. So the state where blue_box_2 is in room_1 and I'm holding some object is during the time between entering room_1 and dropping. So after step 15 (in room_1), I'm holding blue_box_2, and blue_box_2 is not yet in room_1. Then, after dropping, blue_box_2 is in room_1, but I'm not holding anything. So how to satisfy constraint 3? The constraint says "blue_box_2 is in room_1" AND "you are holding some object". That can only be true during the time when I'm in room_1, holding blue_box_2, and then drop it. Wait, no. When I drop it, the object is placed in the room. So after dropping, blue_box_2 is in room_1, but I'm not holding anything. So the only way for both conditions to be true is if I'm holding blue_box_2 while in room_1, but blue_box_2 is in room_1. But when I pick it up in room_3, it's removed from room_3. So when I'm in room_1 holding it, it's not in room_1 yet. Only after dropping. So perhaps this approach doesn't work. Maybe I need to have blue_box_2 in room_1 while holding another object. Hmm, this is tricky.

Alternatively, maybe I can carry another object. For example, after dropping blue_box_2 in room_1, pick up another object in room_1 (like grey_box_1) and be holding it while blue_box_2 is in room_1. But grey_box_1 is in room_1. So steps:

After step 16 (blue_box_2 in room_1), goto grey_box_1 in room_1, pick it up. Then, while holding grey_box_1, blue_box_2 is in room_1. So that satisfies the constraint.

So steps:

17. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_1

18. pick grey_box_1 room_1

Now, in this state, blue_box_2 is in room_1 (from step 16), and I'm holding grey_box_1. So constraint 3 is satisfied here.

But this adds more steps. However, this also satisfies constraint 7 (holding grey_box_1) in step 18.

So far, constraints 3 and 7 are covered.

Now, constraint 4: At some state, either holding blue_box_1 or purple_ball_1 in room_2. Let's see. We have blue_box_1 in room_4 (from step 9). If I pick it up again, that would satisfy "holding blue_box_1". Or, move purple_ball_1 to room_2.

Purple_ball_1 is in room_3. To move it to room_2, need to go from room_3 to room_1 via yellow_door_1 (unlocked), then to room_2 via grey_door_1 (which is locked). So need to unlock grey_door_1.

Alternatively, maybe after unlocking green_door_1 (connecting room_4 and room_2), I can go from room_4 to room_2 via green_door_1, then go to room_1 via grey_door_1 (if unlocked). But grey_door_1 is initially locked. So need to unlock it.

But this is getting too involved. Perhaps the easier way is to hold blue_box_1 at some point. Since blue_box_1 is in room_4 after step 9, I can pick it up again. So during step 9, we dropped blue_box_1 in room_4. So later, in room_4, I can gotoobject blue_box_1, pick it up. That would satisfy constraint 4.

So let's say after step 18 (holding grey_box_1 in room_1), perhaps we need to move back to room_4. But this is getting too long. Maybe there's a more optimal path.

Alternatively, when we are in room_4 after dropping blue_box_1 (step 9), we can pick it up again. Let's say:

After step 9:

10. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_4

11. pick blue_box_1 room_4

Now, holding blue_box_1. This satisfies constraint 4 (holding blue_box_1). But then we need to drop it somewhere. But this adds steps. However, this might help satisfy constraint 4.

But this would require steps after step 9 to include picking up blue_box_1 again.

But maybe it's better to plan in such a way that multiple constraints are satisfied with fewer actions.

Now, let's think about constraint 5: green_door_1 must be locked in some state. Initially, it's locked. So that's already satisfied in the initial state. But the problem is that after we toggle it to unlock, we need to have a state where it's locked again? No, the constraint says "at least one state" where it's locked. The initial state has it locked, so that's covered. So constraint 5 is already satisfied by the initial state.

Constraint 6: If green_door_1 is locked in any state s, then I must be holding some object in s or after. Since initially, green_door_1 is locked, and in the initial state I'm not holding anything. So this violates constraint 6 unless during or after the state where green_door_1 is locked, I hold something. But the initial state is a state where green_door_1 is locked and I'm not holding anything. So this would violate constraint 6. Therefore, the initial state cannot be considered as satisfying the "if" part unless we ensure that after any state where green_door_1 is locked, I hold something at some point.

Wait, the constraint says: "If green_door_1 is locked in some state s, then expression 'you are holding some object' must hold at s or at some state after s."

In the initial state, green_door_1 is locked, and I'm not holding anything. So this would require that at some state after the initial state, I hold something. Which I do when I pick up blue_box_1 in step 5. So that's okay. So as long as I eventually hold something, this constraint is satisfied.

Constraint 8: At some state, either in room_2 or holding purple_box_1. Purple_box_1 is in room_3. So either I go to room_2 or hold purple_box_1. To go to room_2, I can use green_door_1 after unlocking it. But after unlocking green_door_1 (step 11 in the initial plan), I can go to room_2. So that would satisfy being in room_2.

Constraint 9: Holding some object. This is satisfied in steps where I pick up any object.

Constraint 10: In front of yellow_door_1. Yellow_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3. To be in front of it, I need to be in room_1 or room_3 and use gotodoor. For example, when unlocking yellow_door_1 (step 14), we are in front of it. So that step satisfies constraint 10.

Constraint 11: In front of green_door_1. This is part of the goal, so after step 10 (if that's the step where we goto green_door_1), we are in front of it.

Constraint 12: If in front of green_door_1 in some state, then earlier state where holding something. So before going to green_door_1, I must have held something. For example, when I move blue_box_1 to room_4 (steps 5-9), I was holding it. So that's satisfied.

Constraint 13: Either empty is in room_2 or in front of purple_box_1. Empty is an object, but I think this might refer to an empty position. Alternatively, perhaps "empty_0" is in room_2. But "empty_0" is a special object. However, the initial state doesn't mention empty_0 being in any room. Maybe this is a misinterpretation. Alternatively, "empty" could mean that there's an empty spot in room_2. But rooms have positions, and being in front of an empty position is possible. But the constraint says "empty is in room_2" or "in front of purple_box_1". Purple_box_1 is in room_3. So if I go in front of purple_box_1 in room_3, that satisfies the second part. For example, when I picked blue_box_2 in room_3, maybe I passed by purple_box_1. Or, perhaps during the process of moving around room_3, I can gotoempty, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, gotoobject purple_box_1 in room_3. So perhaps during step 11 (if in room_3), gotoobject purple_box_1. But in the earlier steps, when I'm in room_3 to pick blue_box_1, maybe I can also gotoobject purple_box_1. But this may not be necessary. Alternatively, after dropping blue_box_2 in room_1, I can go back to room_3 and gotoobject purple_box_1. But this adds steps. However, the constraint just needs one state where either empty is in room_2 or in front of purple_box_1. Since room_2 initially has yellow_box_1, but after moving blue_box_2 to room_1, perhaps room_2 still has yellow_box_1. So "empty is in room_2" is not true unless there's an empty position. But maybe the presence of any object doesn't block empty positions. This is unclear. Alternatively, if I gotoempty in room_2, that would satisfy the first condition. But to gotoempty in room_2, I need to be in room_2. So after unlocking green_door_1, I can go to room_2 and gotoempty there, which satisfies the first part of the constraint.

So, putting this all together, the plan would involve:

1. Unlocking grey_door_2 to move blue_box_1 to room_4.

2. Unlocking yellow_door_1 to move blue_box_2 to room_1.

3. Picking up grey_box_1 in room_1.

4. Unlocking green_door_1 to be in front of it, unlocked.

But this is getting quite involved. Let's try to outline the steps with the necessary actions:

- Start in room_4.

Steps to move blue_box_1 to room_4:

1. gotodoor grey_door_2 room_4 room_3

2. toggle grey_door_2 (unlock)

3. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_2 (now in room_3)

4. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_3

5. pick blue_box_1 room_3

6. gotodoor grey_door_2 room_3 room_4

7. gotoroom room_3 room_4 grey_door_2 (back to room_4)

8. gotoempty

9. drop blue_box_1 room_4 (now constraint 2 is satisfied when green_door_1 is unlocked)

Now, to handle constraint 3 (blue_box_2 in room_1 while holding something):

10. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_2 (back to room_3)

11. gotoobject blue_box_2 room_3

12. pick blue_box_2 room_3 (now holding it)

13. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1

14. toggle yellow_door_1 (unlock)

15. gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_1 (now in room_1)

16. drop blue_box_2 room_1 (now blue_box_2 is in room_1)

17. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_1

18. pick grey_box_1 room_1 (now holding grey_box_1, satisfying constraints 7 and 9)

Now, to satisfy constraint 4 (holding blue_box_1 or purple_ball_1 in room_2):

We have blue_box_1 in room_4. If we can go to room_4 and pick it up again, but we need to get back. Alternatively, move purple_ball_1 to room_2.

Purple_ball_1 is in room_3. To move it to room_2, we need to go from room_3 to room_1 via yellow_door_1 (unlocked), then to room_2 via grey_door_1 (which is locked). So need to unlock grey_door_1.

Steps:

19. gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1 (back to room_3)

20. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_3

21. pick purple_ball_1 room_3

22. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1

23. gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_1 (now in room_1)

24. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2

25. toggle grey_door_1 (unlock)

26. gotoroom room_1 room_2 grey_door_1 (now in room_2)

27. drop purple_ball_1 room_2 (now constraint 4 is satisfied)

But this adds many steps. Alternatively, since we already have blue_box_1 in room_4, maybe we can pick it up again to satisfy constraint 4:

From room_4:

19. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_4

20. pick blue_box_1 room_4 (now holding it, satisfying constraint 4)

But then we have to drop it again.

But this might be more optimal.

Now, to handle constraint 8: being in room_2 or holding purple_box_1. If we go to room_2, that's covered in step 26. Or, we can hold purple_box_1. But purple_box_1 is in room_3. So if we pick it up:

From room_3:

But this is getting too long. Maybe going to room_2 via green_door_1 after unlocking it.

Steps to unlock green_door_1:

After step 18 (holding grey_box_1 in room_1):

19. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2

20. toggle grey_door_1 (unlock)

21. gotoroom room_1 room_2 grey_door_1 (now in room_2)

22. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4

23. toggle green_door_1 (unlock)

But wait, green_door_1 connects room_2 and room_4. So from room_2, gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4, toggle to unlock. Then, be in front of it, which satisfies the goal. However, we need to ensure that blue_box_1 is in room_4 before this toggle.

In this path, after step 9, blue_box_1 is in room_4. Then, when we toggle green_door_1 in step 23, the constraint 2 is satisfied.

So steps after step 18:

19. gotoroom room_1 room_2 grey_door_1 (assuming grey_door_1 is unlocked)

But wait, grey_door_1 is initially locked. So in step 19, we need to unlock it first.

This is getting too complicated. Perhaps the optimal plan is shorter by focusing on the main goal and satisfying the constraints with minimal steps.

Let me try to outline a more optimal path:

Initial state: room_4.

Need to unlock green_door_1 and be in front of it, with blue_box_1 in room_4 beforehand.

Also, need to handle constraints.

Steps:

1. gotodoor grey_door_2 room_4 room_3

2. toggle grey_door_2 (unlock)

3. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_2 (now in room_3)

4. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_3

5. pick blue_box_1 room_3 (holding it, satisfies constraints 9, 4)

6. gotodoor grey_door_2 room_3 room_4

7. gotoroom room_3 room_4 grey_door_2 (back to room_4)

8. gotoempty

9. drop blue_box_1 room_4 (now blue_box_1 is in room_4, satisfying constraint 2)

10. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2

11. toggle green_door_1 (unlock; now in front of green_door_1 and it's unlocked, achieving the goal)

But need to check other constraints.

Constraints:

3. blue_box_2 in room_1 and holding something: Not satisfied yet. So need additional steps.

7. holding grey_box_1: Not satisfied yet.

8. in room_2 or holding purple_box_1: Not satisfied yet.

10. in front of yellow_door_1: Not satisfied yet.

13. empty in room_2 or in front of purple_box_1: Not satisfied yet.

So this plan is insufficient. Need to add steps.

Alternative approach: After step 9 (blue_box_1 in room_4), go to room_3 again, pick blue_box_2, take it to room_1.

Steps:

10. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_2

11. gotoobject blue_box_2 room_3

12. pick blue_box_2 room_3 (holding it, satisfies constraint 9)

13. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1

14. toggle yellow_door_1 (unlock)

15. gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_1 (now in room_1)

16. drop blue_box_2 room_1 (blue_box_2 in room_1)

17. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_1

18. pick grey_box_1 room_1 (satisfies constraints 7 and 9)

19. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2

20. toggle grey_door_1 (unlock)

21. gotoroom room_1 room_2 grey_door_1 (now in room_2, satisfying constraint 8)

22. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4

23. toggle green_door_1 (unlock; now in front of green_door_1, which is unlocked)

Now, let's check the constraints:

Constraint 3: blue_box_2 in room_1 (step 16) and holding something (step 12 when picking blue_box_2). So during step 12-15, while holding blue_box_2, blue_box_2 is not yet in room_1. Only after step 16 is blue_box_2 in room_1, but I'm not holding it. So this doesn't satisfy the constraint. So perhaps during step 15, when entering room_1 while holding blue_box_2, blue_box_2 is not in room_1 yet. So to satisfy the constraint, we need to be holding something while blue_box_2 is in room_1. That can only happen if after dropping blue_box_2 in room_1, I pick up another object (like grey_box_1) and then blue_box_2 is in room_1. So steps 16-18: after dropping blue_box_2, pick up grey_box_1. Then, in step 18, I'm holding grey_box_1 and blue_box_2 is in room_1. So this satisfies constraint 3.

Constraint 4: Either holding blue_box_1 (which was done in step 5) or purple_ball_1 in room_2. Step 5 satisfies this.

Constraint 8: In room_2 (step 21) or holding purple_box_1. Step 21 satisfies this.

Constraint 10: In front of yellow_door_1. Step 13: gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1. So yes, in front of yellow_door_1.

Constraint 13: Either empty in room_2 (after step 21, I'm in room_2. gotoempty here would satisfy it) or in front of purple_box_1. But purple_box_1 is in room_3. So maybe during step 10-14, gotoobject purple_box_1 in room_3. But no, we went to blue_box_2. Alternatively, after step 21, in room_2, do gotoempty, which satisfies the first part.

But need to ensure one of these is done.

Step 21: in room_2. Then:

24. gotoempty (in room_2, satisfying constraint 13's first part)

Now, all constraints are covered.

The final steps would then be:

24. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4

25. toggle green_door_1 (unlock)

But wait, in step 23, we already toggled green_door_1. Wait, no, in the previous steps, after step 21, we are in room_2. Then step 22: gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4. Then step 23: toggle green_door_1 (unlocking it). Then, we are in front of green_door_1, which is unlocked, satisfying the goal.

So the final plan would include these steps, ensuring all constraints are met. However, this seems quite lengthy, and the problem requires an optimal plan with minimal steps. But given the constraints, it's challenging to find a shorter path.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a way to combine some steps. For example, when moving blue_box_1 to room_4, then immediately go to green_door_1, toggle it. But need to satisfy constraint 3, which requires blue_box_2 in room_1 and holding something. So maybe during the process of moving blue_box_1, we also handle other constraints.

But given time constraints, I'll proceed to outline the steps as described, ensuring all constraints are covered.
