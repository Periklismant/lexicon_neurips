Okay, let's analyze this planning problem step by step:

**Initial State:**
- We are in room_2
- Various objects are located in different rooms:
  - purple_box_1 and blue_box_1 are in room_1
  - red_ball_1 is in room_2
  - purple_box_2, green_ball_1, grey_ball_1, and blue_box_2 are in room_3
  - red_box_1 is in room_4
- All doors (blue_door_1, red_door_1, red_door_2, yellow_door_1) are locked
- We are not holding any object
- We have visited room_2

**Goal:**
- We need to be in front of an unlocked red door that connects room_1 and room_3 (which must be red_door_1)

**Constraints:**
1. At some point, we must hold purple_box_2
2. At some point, blue_door_1 must be locked
3. If blue_door_1 is locked, yellow_door_1 must be unlocked at that state or later
4. At some point, we must hold red_box_1
5. At some point, we must either be in front of red_box_1 or holding purple_box_2
6. At some point, we must be in room_2
7. If we are in room_2, we must either be in front of an empty position or holding an object
8. At some point, we must be in room_4
9. At some point, red_door_1 must be unlocked
10. If red_door_1 is unlocked, we must have previously either had grey_ball_1 in room_2 or been holding some object
11. We must never be in room_1
12. At some point, we must either hold purple_box_2 or be in front of it
13. At some point, we must be in front of red_door_1
14. If we are in front of red_door_1, we must have previously either been holding some object or been in front of red_box_1

Let's think about the plan. The final goal is to be in front of an unlocked red_door_1. Given that we can never enter room_1 (constraint 11), we must approach red_door_1 from room_3.

Let's think about how to satisfy all the constraints:
- We start in room_2
- We need to get to room_3 to access purple_box_2
- We need to get to room_4 to access red_box_1
- We need to manipulate doors to move between rooms
- We need to ensure constraints about the order of actions and states are met

Let's start planning:

1. From room_2, we need to go to room_4 to get red_box_1
   - First, we need to unlock red_door_2 between room_2 and room_4

2. From room_4, we need to go to room_3 to get purple_box_2
   - We need to unlock yellow_door_1 between room_4 and room_3

3. We need to ensure that at some point blue_door_1 is locked while yellow_door_1 is unlocked
   - This is easy since blue_door_1 starts locked

4. We need to ensure that before unlocking red_door_1, we either have grey_ball_1 in room_2 or are holding an object
   - We'll be holding objects during our plan

5. We need to make sure we're in front of red_door_1 after having either held an object or been in front of red_box_1
   - We'll be in front of red_box_1 and hold objects

Let's write a more detailed plan:

1. In room_2:
   - We need to go to red_door_2 connecting room_2 and room_4
   - Unlock red_door_2
   - Go to room_4

2. In room_4:
   - Go to red_box_1
   - Pick up red_box_1 (satisfies constraint 4)
   - Go to yellow_door_1
   - Drop red_box_1 (to free our hands)
   - Unlock yellow_door_1 (satisfies constraint 3 since blue_door_1 is locked)
   - Go to room_3

3. In room_3:
   - Go to purple_box_2
   - Pick up purple_box_2 (satisfies constraints 1, 5, and 12)
   - Go to red_door_1
   - Drop purple_box_2 (to free our hands)
   - Unlock red_door_1 (satisfies constraint 9, and constraint 10 is satisfied since we were holding objects)
   - Pick up purple_box_2 again
   - Drop purple_box_2 (to be in front of it for the final state)
   - Go to red_door_1 (satisfies constraint 13, and constraint 14 is satisfied since we were holding objects)

This covers all our constraints and achieves our goal. Let's verify:
- We hold purple_box_2 at some point (constraint 1) ✓
- blue_door_1 is locked (constraint 2) ✓ (it starts locked)
- If blue_door_1 is locked, yellow_door_1 must be unlocked (constraint 3) ✓ (we unlock yellow_door_1)
- We hold red_box_1 at some point (constraint 4) ✓
- We are either in front of red_box_1 or holding purple_box_2 (constraint 5) ✓ (we do both)
- We are in room_2 (constraint 6) ✓ (we start in room_2)
- When in room_2, we go in front of empty or hold an object (constraint 7) ✓ (we go to door)
- We are in room_4 (constraint 8) ✓
- red_door_1 is unlocked (constraint 9) ✓
- Before unlocking red_door_1, we held an object (constraint 10) ✓
- We never enter room_1 (constraint 11) ✓
- We hold purple_box_2 or are in front of it (constraint 12) ✓ (we do both)
- We are in front of red_door_1 (constraint 13) ✓
- Before being in front of red_door_1, we held objects (constraint 14) ✓

Actually, I've realized we need to be more careful about constraint 14. We need to be in front of red_box_1 or hold an object before being in front of red_door_1. Let's make sure we're in front of red_box_1 in room_4 before going to red_door_1 in room_3.

Also, constraint 7 says if we are in room_2, we need to be in front of empty or holding an object. We should make sure this happens immediately after the initial state.

Let me refine the plan:

1. We start in room_2
   - Go to an empty position (satisfies constraint 7)
   - Go to red_ball_1 (in room_2)
   - Pick up red_ball_1 (this also satisfies constraint 7 for later visits to room_2)
   - Go to red_door_2
   - Toggle red_door_2 to unlock it
   - Go to room_4 using red_door_2 (satisfies constraint 8)

2. In room_4:
   - Go to red_box_1 (satisfies part of constraint 14)
   - Put down red_ball_1 (to free hands)
   - Pick up red_box_1 (satisfies constraint 4)
   - Go to yellow_door_1
   - Toggle yellow_door_1 to unlock it (satisfies constraint 3 since blue_door_1 is locked)
   - Go to room_3 using yellow_door_1

3. In room_3:
   - Go to purple_box_2
   - Drop red_box_1 (to free hands)
   - Pick up purple_box_2 (satisfies constraints 1, 5, and 12)
   - Go to red_door_1
   - Toggle red_door_1 to unlock it (satisfies constraint 9, and constraint 10 is satisfied since we were holding objects)
   - Goto empty (to ensure we're not in front of red_door_1 yet)
   - Go to red_door_1 (satisfies constraint 13, and constraint 14 is satisfied since we were in front of red_box_1)

This refined plan should satisfy all constraints and achieve our goal.

But wait, one more check. I said we would drop red_ball_1 in room_4 before picking up red_box_1, but I forgot to specify going to an empty position first. Let me fix that.

Let me now write the precise sequence of actions:

1. gotoempty
2. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_2
3. pick red_ball_1 room_2
4. gotodoor red_door_2 room_2 room_4
5. toggle red_door_2
6. gotoroom room_2 room_4 red_door_2
7. gotoobject red_box_1 room_4
8. gotoempty
9. drop red_ball_1 room_4
10. gotoobject red_box_1 room_4
11. pick red_box_1 room_4
12. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_3
13. toggle yellow_door_1
14. gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_1
15. gotoobject purple_box_2 room_3
16. gotoempty
17. drop red_box_1 room_3
18. gotoobject purple_box_2 room_3
19. pick purple_box_2 room_3
20. gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1
21. toggle red_door_1
22. gotoempty
23. drop purple_box_2 room_3
24. gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1

Actually, let me just triple-check all the constraints:

1. We hold purple_box_2 in step 19 ✓
2. blue_door_1 is locked from the beginning ✓
3. We unlock yellow_door_1 in step 13 while blue_door_1 is locked ✓ 
4. We hold red_box_1 from step 11 to step 17 ✓
5. We are in front of red_box_1 in step 7 and hold purple_box_2 in step 19 ✓
6. We start in room_2 ✓
7. In room_2, we go to an empty position in step 1 ✓
8. We are in room_4 after step 6 ✓
9. We unlock red_door_1 in step 21 ✓
10. Before unlocking red_door_1, we hold objects (red_ball_1, red_box_1, purple_box_2) ✓
11. We never enter room_1 ✓
12. We hold purple_box_2 in step 19 and are in front of it in steps 15 and 18 ✓
13. We are in front of red_door_1 in steps 20 and 24 ✓
14. Before being in front of red_door_1 in step 20, we were in front of red_box_1 in step 7 ✓

Let me check if this achieves our final goal: 
- Be in front of an unlocked red door that connects room_1 and room_3 (red_door_1)

We end in step 24 by being in front of red_door_1, which we unlocked in step 21. So our goal is achieved. The plan looks valid!

Actually, I think I need to double-check constraint 10. It says:
"If expression 'red_door_1 is not locked' holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: 'At least one of the following conditions is true: "grey_ball_1 is in room_2", "you are holding some object"'"

So before we unlock red_door_1, we need to either have grey_ball_1 in room_2 or be holding an object. In our plan, we are holding purple_box_2 when we unlock red_door_1, so this constraint is satisfied.

Actually, let's double-check our end state. We need to be in front of an unlocked red door that connects room_1 and room_3. In our plan, we have:
1. Unlocked red_door_1 which connects room_1 and room_3
2. Ended with being in front of red_door_1

This satisfies our goal state. I believe our plan is correct.

But I think we could make the plan more efficient by eliminating unnecessary steps. Let's try to optimize:

1. gotoempty  // To satisfy constraint 7
2. gotodoor red_door_2 room_2 room_4  // Go to the door to room_4
3. toggle red_door_2  // Unlock the door
4. gotoroom room_2 room_4 red_door_2  // Go to room_4 (satisfies constraint 8)
5. gotoobject red_box_1 room_4  // Go to red_box_1 (satisfies part of constraint 14)
6. pick red_box_1 room_4  // Pick up red_box_1 (satisfies constraint 4)
7. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_3  // Go to the door to room_3
8. toggle yellow_door_1  // Unlock the door (satisfies constraint 3)
9. gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_1  // Go to room_3
10. gotoobject purple_box_2 room_3  // Go to purple_box_2
11. gotoempty  // Go to empty position to drop red_box_1
12. drop red_box_1 room_3  // Free hands
13. gotoobject purple_box_2 room_3  // Go back to purple_box_2 (satisfies constraint 12)
14. pick purple_box_2 room_3  // Pick up purple_box_2 (satisfies constraints 1, 5, and 12)
15. gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1  // Go to red_door_1
16. toggle red_door_1  // Unlock red_door_1 (satisfies constraint 9, and constraint 10 is satisfied)
17. gotoempty  // Go to empty position to drop purple_box_2
18. drop purple_box_2 room_3  // Drop purple_box_2
19. gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1  // Go back to red_door_1 (satisfies constraint 13)

Since we never need red_ball_1 for anything specific, we can skip picking it up altogether, which makes our plan more efficient.

Final check:
1. We hold purple_box_2 in step 14 (constraint 1) ✓
2. blue_door_1 is locked from the beginning (constraint 2) ✓
3. We unlock yellow_door_1 in step 8 while blue_door_1 is locked (constraint 3) ✓
4. We hold red_box_1 from steps 6-12 (constraint 4) ✓
5. We are in front of red_box_1 in step 5 and hold purple_box_2 in step 14 (constraint 5) ✓
6. We start in room_2 (constraint 6) ✓
7. In room_2, we go to an empty position in step 1 (constraint 7) ✓
8. We are in room_4 after step 4 (constraint 8) ✓
9. We unlock red_door_1 in step 16 (constraint 9) ✓
10. Before unlocking red_door_1, we hold objects (red_box_1, purple_box_2) (constraint 10) ✓
11. We never enter room_1 (constraint 11) ✓
12. We hold purple_box_2 in step 14 and are in front of it in steps 10 and 13 (constraint 12) ✓
13. We are in front of red_door_1 in steps 15 and 19 (constraint 13) ✓
14. Before being in front of red_door_1 in step 15, we were in front of red_box_1 in step 5 (constraint 14) ✓

And our goal is to be in front of an unlocked red door connecting room_1 and room_3, which we achieve in step 19. The plan looks valid and optimized.

Wait, let's revisit constraint 7:
"If expression 'you are in room_2' holds in some state s, then expression 'At least one of the following conditions is true: "you are in front of empty", "you are holding some object"' must hold at s or at some state after s"

When we start, we are in room_2 but not in front of empty and not holding any object. So the first action must be to go to an empty position (which we have in our plan). This satisfies constraint 7.

The optimized plan looks good.

Let me see if it can be further optimized:

From steps 10-14, we have:
10. gotoobject purple_box_2 room_3  // Go to purple_box_2
11. gotoempty  // Go to empty position to drop red_box_1
12. drop red_box_1 room_3  // Free hands
13. gotoobject purple_box_2 room_3  // Go back to purple_box_2
14. pick purple_box_2 room_3  // Pick up purple_box_2

We can simplify this by dropping red_box_1 while in front of purple_box_2, avoiding step 11 and 13:

10. gotoobject purple_box_2 room_3  // Go to purple_box_2
11. drop red_box_1 room_3  // Free hands
12. pick purple_box_2 room_3  // Pick up purple_box_2

Similarly, for steps 15-19, we have:
15. gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1  // Go to red_door_1
16. toggle red_door_1  // Unlock red_door_1
17. gotoempty  // Go to empty position to drop purple_box_2
18. drop purple_box_2 room_3  // Drop purple_box_2
19. gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1  // Go back to red_door_1

We can simplify by dropping purple_box_2 while in front of red_door_1, avoiding step 17 and 19:

15. gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1  // Go to red_door_1
16. toggle red_door_1  // Unlock red_door_1
17. drop purple_box_2 room_3  // Drop purple_box_2

But wait, our goal is to be in front of an unlocked red door connecting room_1 and room_3, which we would still achieve after dropping purple_box_2 in front of red_door_1. But since we're being asked for an optimal plan (minimizing length), we should not do unnecessary drops if they don't help us achieve the goal or constraints.

Since our goal is just to be in front of an unlocked red_door_1, we can simplify the end of our plan:

15. gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1  // Go to red_door_1
16. toggle red_door_1  // Unlock red_door_1

We don't need to drop purple_box_2 since our goal doesn't specify that we need to have empty hands at the end. We're still in front of the unlocked red_door_1, which achieves our goal.

But wait, the goal specifically mentions:
"There is a door d such that "The following conditions are all true: "d is red", "room_1 and room_3 are connected via d", "you are in front of d", "d is not locked"""

It doesn't mention anything about whether we're holding an object or not. So, we can end the plan after unlocking red_door_1 and still achieve the goal.

Final optimized plan:
1. gotoempty  // To satisfy constraint 7
2. gotodoor red_door_2 room_2 room_4  // Go to the door to room_4
3. toggle red_door_2  // Unlock the door
4. gotoroom room_2 room_4 red_door_2  // Go to room_4 (satisfies constraint 8)
5. gotoobject red_box_1 room_4  // Go to red_box_1 (satisfies part of constraint 14)
6. pick red_box_1 room_4  // Pick up red_box_1 (satisfies constraint 4)
7. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_3  // Go to the door to room_3
8. toggle yellow_door_1  // Unlock the door (satisfies constraint 3)
9. gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_1  // Go to room_3
10. gotoobject purple_box_2 room_3  // Go to purple_box_2
11. drop red_box_1 room_3  // Free hands
12. pick purple_box_2 room_3  // Pick up purple_box_2 (satisfies constraints 1, 5, and 12)
13. gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1  // Go to red_door_1
14. toggle red_door_1  // Unlock red_door_1 (satisfies constraint 9, and constraint 10 is satisfied)

This 14-step plan should satisfy all constraints and achieve our goal in the most efficient way.

Actually, there's a slight issue. We end up holding purple_box_2, but we also need to be in front of red_door_1. Let's double-check if after we pick up an object, we're still in front of it. Let's see...

The description says that after performing the "pick" action regarding an object x, "you are no longer in front of x" and "you are carrying x". So, after picking up purple_box_2, we are no longer in front of it.

So, after step 12, we're holding purple_box_2 but not in front of it. We need to add step 13 to go to red_door_1.

Checking our constraints again, it seems like we need to be in front of red_door_1 (constraint 13) and before that, we need to have either been in front of red_box_1 or holding an object (constraint 14). We satisfy constraint 14 by being in front of red_box_1 in step 5.

The final plan looks correct. Let me just double-check all the effects of our actions to make sure we're in the correct state after each action.

State after each action:
1. We're in room_2, in front of an empty position.
2. We're in room_2, in front of red_door_2.
3. We're in room_2, in front of red_door_2, and red_door_2 is unlocked.
4. We're in room_4, not in front of anything.
5. We're in room_4, in front of red_box_1.
6. We're in room_4, holding red_box_1, not in front of anything.
7. We're in room_4, holding red_box_1, in front of yellow_door_1.
8. We're in room_4, holding red_box_1, in front of yellow_door_1, and yellow_door_1 is unlocked.
9. We're in room_3, holding red_box_1, not in front of anything.
10. We're in room_3, holding red_box_1, in front of purple_box_2.
11. We're in room_3, not holding anything, in front of red_box_1 (after dropping it).
12. We're in room_3, holding purple_box_2, not in front of anything.
13. We're in room_3, holding purple_box_2, in front of red_door_1.
14. We're in room_3, holding purple_box_2, in front of red_door_1, and red_door_1 is unlocked.

Actually, there's a discrepancy in step 11. The description says that after performing the "drop" action regarding an object x, "you are no longer carrying x", "you are in front of x", "your hands are empty", and "object x is situated in the room you are currently in". So, after dropping red_box_1, we should be in front of red_box_1, not in front of purple_box_2. We need to add an extra step to go back to purple_box_2.

Let's restate the plan with this correction:

1. gotoempty  // To satisfy constraint 7
2. gotodoor red_door_2 room_2 room_4  // Go to the door to room_4
3. toggle red_door_2  // Unlock the door
4. gotoroom room_2 room_4 red_door_2  // Go to room_4 (satisfies constraint 8)
5. gotoobject red_box_1 room_4  // Go to red_box_1 (satisfies part of constraint 14)
6. pick red_box_1 room_4  // Pick up red_box_1 (satisfies constraint 4)
7. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_3  // Go to the door to room_3
8. toggle yellow_door_1  // Unlock the door (satisfies constraint 3)
9. gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_1  // Go to room_3
10. gotoobject purple_box_2 room_3  // Go to purple_box_2
11. drop red_box_1 room_3  // Free hands (now we're in front of red_box_1)
12. gotoobject purple_box_2 room_3  // Go back to purple_box_2
13. pick purple_box_2 room_3  // Pick up purple_box_2 (satisfies constraints 1, 5, and 12)
14. gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1  // Go to red_door_1
15. toggle red_door_1  // Unlock red_door_1 (satisfies constraint 9, and constraint 10 is satisfied)

This 15-step plan should be correct and achieve our goal in the most efficient way.

Let me double-check the state after dropping red_box_1 in step 11. If we're in front of purple_box_2 in step 10 and then drop red_box_1, according to the drop action's effects, we should be in front of red_box_1 after dropping it, not in front of purple_box_2. So we need to go back to purple_box_2 in step 12.

I notice a subtlety in the drop effects: after dropping an object, "you are in front of x". But I was saying we'd be in front of red_box_1 after dropping it. The correct interpretation is that we'd be in front of the object we dropped, which is red_box_1. So after step 11, we are in front of red_box_1, not purple_box_2 or anything else. So our corrected plan is correct.

The 15-step plan is:
1. gotoempty
2. gotodoor red_door_2 room_2 room_4
3. toggle red_door_2
4. gotoroom room_2 room_4 red_door_2
5. gotoobject red_box_1 room_4
6. pick red_box_1 room_4
7. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_3
8. toggle yellow_door_1
9. gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_1
10. gotoobject purple_box_2 room_3
11. drop red_box_1 room_3
12. gotoobject purple_box_2 room_3
13. pick purple_box_2 room_3
14. gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1
15. toggle red_door_1

Wait, there's one more issue. When we drop red_box_1 in step 11, we end up in front of red_box_1, not in front of purple_box_2. So in step 12, we're going from being in front of red_box_1 to being in front of purple_box_2.

Let's see if this plan achieves our goal and satisfies all constraints. Our goal is to be in front of an unlocked red door connecting room_1 and room_3, which we achieve in step 15. Let's check the constraints one more time:

1. We hold purple_box_2 after step 13 (constraint 1) ✓
2. blue_door_1 is locked from the beginning (constraint 2) ✓
3. We unlock yellow_door_1 in step 8 while blue_door_1 is locked (constraint 3) ✓
4. We hold red_box_1 from steps 6-10 (constraint 4) ✓
5. We are in front of red_box_1 in step 5 and hold purple_box_2 after step 13 (constraint 5) ✓
6. We start in room_2 (constraint 6) ✓
7. In room_2, we go to an empty position in step 1 (constraint 7) ✓
8. We are in room_4 after step 4 (constraint 8) ✓
9. We unlock red_door_1 in step 15 (constraint 9) ✓
10. Before unlocking red_door_1, we hold objects (red_box_1, purple_box_2) (constraint 10) ✓
11. We never enter room_1 (constraint 11) ✓
12. We hold purple_box_2 after step 13 and are in front of it in steps 10 and 12 (constraint 12) ✓
13. We are in front of red_door_1 in steps 14 and 15 (constraint 13) ✓
14. Before being in front of red_door_1 in step 14, we were in front of red_box_1 in step 5 (constraint 14) ✓

The plan looks correct and optimal.

Actually, one last check. With the "toggle" action, if we're in front of a door d, after toggling, the effects are "if d was locked, then it becomes unlocked, and if d was unlocked, then it becomes locked." We're toggling red_door_1 in step 15, so we're correctly unlocking it. So after step 15, we're in front of an unlocked red_door_1, which achieves our goal. The plan is correct and optimal.

Let me write out the final plan one more time for clarity:
```
gotoempty
gotodoor red_door_2 room_2 room_4
toggle red_door_2
gotoroom room_2 room_4 red_door_2
gotoobject red_box_1 room_4
pick red_box_1 room_4
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_3
toggle yellow_door_1
gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_1
gotoobject purple_box_2 room_3
drop red_box_1 room_3
gotoobject purple_box_2 room_3
pick purple_box_2 room_3
gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1
toggle red_door_1
```

This is our optimal plan.
