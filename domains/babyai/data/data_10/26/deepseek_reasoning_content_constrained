Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. It's a bit complex with all the constraints, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

First, let's understand the goal. The final situation requires a red door d that connects room_1 and room_3, we need to be in front of it, and it must be unlocked. From the initial state, the doors connecting room_1 and room_3 are red_door_1. So d is red_door_1. The goal is to have red_door_1 unlocked, be in front of it, and it's already connecting room_1 and room_3. So we need to unlock red_door_1, go to front of it, and ensure it's not locked.

Now, the initial state: the agent is in room_2. All doors are locked initially. So to get to red_door_1 (which connects room_1 and room_3), the agent needs to navigate through other doors, but the problem is that all doors are locked. Wait, but maybe some doors can be unlocked by toggling. The toggle action can unlock a door if you are in front of it. But to get in front of a door, you need to be in a room that the door connects and that the position in front of the door is not blocked. However, the initial position is room_2. Let's see the connections:

From room_2, the doors are blue_door_1 (connecting to room_1) and red_door_2 (connecting to room_4). Both are locked. So initially, the agent is in room_2 and can't go anywhere unless they unlock a door. But to unlock a door (toggle), the agent must be in front of it. But to go to a door, the agent must be in a room connected by that door, and the position in front of the door isn't blocked. So for example, in room_2, the doors are blue_door_1 (connects to room_1) and red_door_2 (connects to room_4). The agent is in room_2, so can go to blue_door_1 or red_door_2. But if the door is locked, can the agent still go in front of it? Wait, the "gotodoor" action's preconditions are: you can go to door d if you are in a room connected by d and there's no object blocking the position in front of d in the current room. The door being locked doesn't affect the ability to go in front of it. So the agent can go to the door's front even if it's locked. Then, once in front of the door, toggle it to unlock.

So first step: go to blue_door_1 from room_2. But wait, blue_door_1 is in room_2 and room_1. So in room_2, the agent can use gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1. Then toggle it to unlock. Then, using gotoroom room_2 room_1 blue_door_1, the agent can move to room_1. However, the constraint says "you are not in room_1" must hold in every state. So the agent can never enter room_1. So that complicates things. Because the initial state's blue_door_1 is locked, but if we unlock it, we can't go to room_1. So maybe we need to find another way.

Wait, the constraints include that "you are not in room_1" in every state. So the agent cannot enter room_1 at any point. That's a critical constraint. So any action that would move the agent to room_1 is invalid. So blue_door_1 connects room_1 and room_2. Since the agent can't go to room_1, they can't use that door to move. So the only doors available from room_2 are red_door_2 to room_4. But red_door_2 is locked. So the agent needs to unlock red_door_2. To do that, they need to go to red_door_2 in room_2, toggle it. But is the position in front of red_door_2 in room_2 blocked by any objects? The initial state's room_2 has red_ball_1. But objects in the room may block doors if they are placed in front of them. Wait, the problem states that the "goto door" action requires that there's no object blocking the position in front of d in the current room. So if an object is in front of the door in the current room, you can't go to the door. So in room_2, the red_ball_1 is present. Is it blocking red_door_2? The initial state doesn't mention any objects blocking doors. Wait, the problem's initial state lists where objects are, but not their positions relative to doors. So unless specified, we can assume that objects are not blocking the doors. So the agent can go to red_door_2 in room_2.

So the plan could start with:

1. gotodoor red_door_2 room_2 room_4
2. toggle red_door_2 (unlocking it)
3. gotoroom room_2 room_4 red_door_2 (moving to room_4)
4. Now in room_4, which has red_box_1. From room_4, the doors are red_door_2 (connects to room_2) and yellow_door_1 (connects to room_3). Both are locked. So in room_4, the agent can go to yellow_door_1. But yellow_door_1 is locked. So need to toggle it. But to do that, go to yellow_door_1 in room_4, toggle it. Then move to room_3 via yellow_door_1.

But let's check the constraints. Let's list all constraints again to make sure:

Constraints:

1. Must hold in at least one state: holding purple_box_2
2. blue_door_1 is locked in at least one state (which it is initially)
3. If blue_door_1 is locked in state s, then yellow_door_1 must be unlocked in s or after
4. Must hold: holding red_box_1 in some state
5. At least one state has either in front of red_box_1 or holding purple_box_2
6. Must be in room_2 in some state (initially true, but maybe after moving)
7. If in room_2, then in that state or after, must be in front of empty or holding something
8. Must be in room_4 in some state
9. red_door_1 must be unlocked in some state
10. If red_door_1 is unlocked, then earlier state must have grey_ball_1 in room_2 or holding something
11. Never in room_1
12. At least one state: holding purple_box_2 or in front of it
13. Must be in front of red_door_1 in some state
14. If in front of red_door_1, then earlier state had holding something or in front of red_box_1

So, the goal is to be in front of red_door_1 (which is in room_1 and room_3) with it unlocked. But since the agent can't enter room_1, they must be in room_3 to be in front of red_door_1. Because red_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3, so in room_3, the agent can go to red_door_1. Then toggle it to unlock, satisfying the goal.

But how to get to room_3? Let's see possible paths. Starting in room_2, the agent can go to room_4 via red_door_2 (after unlocking it). Then from room_4, go to room_3 via yellow_door_1 (needs to unlock yellow_door_1). So steps could be:

1. gotodoor red_door_2 room_2 room_4
2. toggle red_door_2 (unlock)
3. gotoroom room_2 room_4 red_door_2 (now in room_4)
4. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_3
5. toggle yellow_door_1 (unlock)
6. gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_1 (now in room_3)
7. Now in room_3, which has purple_box_2, green_ball_1, grey_ball_1, blue_box_2. Need to go to red_door_1 (which connects room_1 and room_3). So in room_3, the agent can go to red_door_1.

But first, the agent needs to pick up purple_box_2 to satisfy constraint 1 and 12. Let's plan that.

In room_3:

8. gotoobject purple_box_2 room_3
9. pick purple_box_2 room_3 (now holding it; satisfies constraints 1 and 12)
Then drop it somewhere? Wait, but maybe not necessary. Also, constraint 5 requires that in some state, the agent is either in front of red_box_1 (in room_4) or holding purple_box_2. Since step 9 picks up purple_box_2, that satisfies condition 5.

But also, constraint 4 requires holding red_box_1 in some state. red_box_1 is in room_4. So after going to room_4, the agent can pick it up.

So after step 6 (in room_3), agent can go to room_4 again, but that might not be necessary. Let's see.

Wait, the agent needs to get to red_door_1 in room_3. So steps:

After step 6 (in room_3):

7. gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1
8. toggle red_door_1 (unlocking it; this will satisfy the goal once we are in front of it and it's unlocked)
But red_door_1 is initially locked. So after step 8, it's unlocked. Then the agent is in front of red_door_1 (room_3 side), which meets the goal condition. But the goal requires that the door is red. red_door_1 is red, connects room_1 and room_3, and now it's unlocked. So after step 8, the agent is in front of red_door_1, which is unlocked, satisfying the goal. So that's the final step.

But also, the constraints:

- Constraint 9: red_door_1 must be unlocked in some state. That's achieved here.

- Constraint 10: if red_door_1 is unlocked (step 8), then in an earlier state, either grey_ball_1 is in room_2 or the agent was holding something. grey_ball_1 starts in room_3. To get it to room_2, the agent would need to carry it. But in step 9, the agent picks up purple_box_2. So when the agent is holding purple_box_2, that's holding something, which would satisfy the condition for constraint 10. So step 9 (holding purple_box_2) occurs before step 8 (unlocking red_door_1). Therefore, when we unlock red_door_1 (step 8), the agent was holding something (purple_box_2) in an earlier state, satisfying constraint 10.

But wait, the steps need to be ordered correctly. Let's outline again:

After getting to room_3 (step 6):

7. gotoobject purple_box_2 room_3
8. pick purple_box_2 room_3 (now holding it)
9. gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1
10. toggle red_door_1 (unlocking it)

At step 10, red_door_1 is unlocked. The earlier state (step 8) has the agent holding something, satisfying constraint 10.

Now, the agent is in front of red_door_1 (room_3 side) and it's unlocked. So the goal is achieved.

But let's check other constraints:

- Constraint 13: must be in front of red_door_1 in some state. Step 10 is that.

- Constraint 14: if in front of red_door_1 (step 10), then earlier state must have holding something (step 8) or in front of red_box_1. Since step 8 is holding something, that satisfies it.

Now, other constraints:

- Must be in room_4 (constraint 8). The agent goes to room_4 in step 3, so that's satisfied.

- Must be in room_2 again (constraint 6). The initial state already has the agent in room_2, but after moving to room_4 and then to room_3, the agent is no longer in room_2. So need to return to room_2 at some point. But constraint 6 says "the following expression must hold in at least one state: you are in room_2". The initial state counts, so unless the agent leaves and never returns, the initial visit to room_2 satisfies it. But after step 3, the agent leaves room_2. However, the initial state says "you have visited room_2", but the agent is in room_2 initially. So the agent starts in room_2, so constraint 6 is satisfied by the initial state. But the problem says "you have visited room_2" in the initial state, so as long as the agent is in room_2 at least once (which they are initially), that's covered. But if the agent leaves room_2 and returns, that would also satisfy it. However, if the agent leaves and doesn't return, does the initial state count? The problem says "the following expression must hold in at least one state". The initial state is part of the states. So yes, the initial state meets that constraint. Therefore, no need to return to room_2 again.

But constraint 7 says: if in room_2 (in some state s), then in s or after, must be in front of empty or holding something. The initial state has the agent in room_2, not holding anything and not in front of anything (since the initial state doesn't mention being in front of any object or door). Wait, the initial state says "you are in room_2" and "you are not holding any object". But the "in front of" status isn't mentioned. So perhaps, by default, the agent is not in front of anything initially. So in the initial state, the agent is in room_2, not holding anything, and not in front of any object or door. Therefore, constraint 7 is triggered: if in room_2 (as in initial state), then in that state or after, must be in front of empty or holding something. But in the initial state, the agent isn't in front of empty or holding something. So the first action must address this. Because the initial state is a state where they are in room_2 but not holding anything or in front of empty. So the first action must be to either go to an empty position (gotoempty) or pick up an object. But the first step in the initial plan I thought of was gotodoor red_door_2 room_2 room_4, which would make the agent in front of red_door_2. But in that case, after the action, the agent is in front of red_door_2, which is a door. But constraint 7 requires that when in room_2, the agent must be in front of empty or holding something. Wait, the constraint says: if in room_2 in state s, then in s or after, must be in front of empty or holding something. So the initial state is in room_2, but not in front of empty or holding something. Therefore, in the initial state s, the agent must perform an action that leads to being in front of empty or holding something in s or after. So the first action must be either gotoempty or pick up an object. However, to pick up an object in room_2, they need to go to it first. But in room_2, there's red_ball_1. So possible steps:

Initial state: in room_2, not holding anything, not in front of anything.

1. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_2 (precondition: in same room as object)
2. pick red_ball_1 room_2 (now holding something, satisfying constraint 7 when in room_2)
But then, after picking up, they can proceed to the door.

But this adds steps. However, constraint 7 must be satisfied. So perhaps the initial steps need to include either going to an empty spot or picking up an object while in room_2.

Wait, in the initial plan I considered steps starting with gotodoor red_door_2, but after that action, the agent is in front of red_door_2. But being in front of a door is not considered "in front of empty" or holding something. So after that action, the agent is in room_2, in front of red_door_2. Then, the next action is toggle. Then, gotoroom to room_4. So after the first action (gotodoor), the agent is in room_2, in front of red_door_2. But the constraint 7 requires that when in room_2, in that state or after, the agent must be in front of empty or holding something. So after the first action (gotodoor), the agent is in room_2 and in front of a door. That doesn't satisfy the constraint. So in the state after the first action (s1), the agent is in room_2 and in front of red_door_2. But the constraint says, if in room_2 (s1), then in s1 or after, must be in front of empty or holding something. So the agent must, in s1 or a subsequent state, be in front of empty or holding something. So perhaps after gotodoor, they can do toggle (which doesn't change their position) and then gotoempty or pick something up.

But the problem is, the agent can't pick up anything in room_2 unless they are in front of the object. So maybe:

1. gotoempty (go to empty spot in room_2) → satisfies constraint 7 in the initial state.
Then proceed with gotodoor red_door_2.

So revised plan:

1. gotoempty (now in front of empty in room_2; satisfies constraint 7)
2. gotodoor red_door_2 room_2 room_4
3. toggle red_door_2 (unlock)
4. gotoroom room_2 room_4 red_door_2 (now in room_4)
5. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_3
6. toggle yellow_door_1 (unlock)
7. gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_1 (now in room_3)
8. gotoobject purple_box_2 room_3
9. pick purple_box_2 room_3 (now holding it; satisfies constraints 1, 12, and during this step, in room_3, but constraint 7 is about room_2)
10. gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1
11. toggle red_door_1 (unlocking it; now satisfies the goal)
But need to check constraint 14: if in front of red_door_1 (step 10), then earlier state had holding something (step 9) or in front of red_box_1. Yes, step 9 is before step 10.

Also, constraint 4 requires holding red_box_1. red_box_1 is in room_4. So the agent needs to go back to room_4 and pick it up. But after step 7, the agent is in room_3. To get back to room_4, they can use yellow_door_1 again. But steps would be:

After step 7 (in room_3):

8. gotoobject purple_box_2 room_3
9. pick purple_box_2 room_3 (hold it)
10. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_4
11. toggle yellow_door_1 (assuming it's locked again? Wait, after step 6, yellow_door_1 was unlocked. But if the agent toggles it again, it would lock it. Wait, in step 6, the agent toggled yellow_door_1 from locked to unlocked. Then, when the agent moves to room_3 via yellow_door_1, the door is unlocked. If the agent wants to return to room_4, they need to use yellow_door_1 again. But the door is already unlocked. So step 10: gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_4. Then gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_1. But that's possible as the door is unlocked.

But after step 9, the agent is holding purple_box_2. To drop it, but maybe not necessary. Let's proceed:

12. gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_1 (now in room_4)
13. gotoobject red_box_1 room_4
14. pick red_box_1 room_4 (now holding it, satisfying constraint 4)
15. drop red_box_1 room_4 (optional, but maybe needed to free hands for other actions)
But this adds steps. However, the plan must include holding red_box_1 in some state. So step 14 satisfies that.

But after holding red_box_1, the agent needs to proceed to the final goal. But this might complicate the plan. Let's see:

Alternatively, after step 7 (in room_3), the agent can go to room_4, pick up red_box_1, then return to room_3, then proceed to red_door_1.

But this adds more steps. Let's outline:

After step 7 (in room_3):

8. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_4
9. gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_1 (now in room_4)
10. gotoobject red_box_1 room_4
11. pick red_box_1 room_4 (hold it; satisfies constraint 4)
12. drop red_box_1 room_4 (maybe not needed)
13. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_3
14. gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_1 (back to room_3)
15. gotoobject purple_box_2 room_3
16. pick purple_box_2 room_3
17. gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1
18. toggle red_door_1

This would satisfy all constraints but adds more steps. However, we need to check the optimality. The problem requires the optimal plan, i.e., the shortest possible. So perhaps there's a way to minimize steps.

But perhaps the agent can pick up purple_box_2 and red_box_1 in the same plan without dropping them. Wait, but the agent can only carry one object at a time. Because the "pick" action requires that you are not holding any other object. So after picking up purple_box_2, to pick up red_box_1, the agent must drop purple_box_2 first. But that complicates things.

Alternatively, after picking up purple_box_2 and toggling red_door_1, maybe the agent can go back to room_4 via room_3's yellow_door_1, then go to room_4, pick up red_box_1, but that requires dropping purple_box_2 first.

This seems to be getting complicated. Let's try to find a minimal path that satisfies all constraints.

Another approach: the agent needs to hold red_box_1 (constraint 4) and purple_box_2 (constraint 1). So they need to pick up both at some point, but since they can only hold one at a time, they need to pick up one, drop it, then pick up the other.

But maybe the sequence could be:

1. In room_2, gotoempty (satisfy constraint 7)
2. gotodoor red_door_2 room_2 room_4
3. toggle red_door_2 (unlock)
4. gotoroom room_2 room_4 red_door_2 (now in room_4)
5. gotoobject red_box_1 room_4
6. pick red_box_1 room_4 (hold it; satisfies constraint 4)
7. drop red_box_1 room_4 (to free hands)
8. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_3
9. toggle yellow_door_1 (unlock)
10. gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_1 (now in room_3)
11. gotoobject purple_box_2 room_3
12. pick purple_box_2 room_3 (hold it; satisfies constraints 1 and 12)
13. gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1
14. toggle red_door_1 (unlock; now satisfies goal)
15. drop purple_box_2 room_3 (if needed, but not necessary)

But after step 14, the agent is in front of red_door_1, which is unlocked. So the goal is met.

Now, let's check all constraints:

- Constraint 1: holding purple_box_2 in step 12: satisfied.
- Constraint 2: blue_door_1 is locked in at least one state. Initial state has it locked, so yes.
- Constraint 3: if blue_door_1 is locked (always true except if toggled, which isn't done), then yellow_door_1 must be unlocked. In step 9, yellow_door_1 is unlocked. Since blue_door_1 remains locked throughout, the constraint is satisfied as yellow_door_1 is unlocked after step 9.
- Constraint 4: holding red_box_1 in step 6: yes.
- Constraint 5: at least one state has in front of red_box_1 or holding purple_box_2. Step 6 is holding red_box_1, step 12 is holding purple_box_2. Also, step 5 is gotoobject red_box_1, so in front of it. So multiple states satisfy this.
- Constraint 6: in room_2 in some state. Initial state counts.
- Constraint 7: if in room_2 (initial state), then in that state or after, must be in front of empty or holding something. Step 1 is gotoempty, so after step 1, in room_2 and in front of empty. So satisfies.
- Constraint 8: in room_4 in some state. Steps 4 and 4+.
- Constraint 9: red_door_1 unlocked in step 14: yes.
- Constraint 10: if red_door_1 is unlocked (step14), then earlier state has grey_ball_1 in room_2 or holding something. The agent held red_box_1 (step6) and purple_box_2 (step12), so earlier states have holding something.
- Constraint 11: never in room_1: correct.
- Constraint 12: holding purple_box_2 (step12) or in front of it (step11). Step11 is in front, step12 is holding: yes.
- Constraint 13: in front of red_door_1 in step13: yes.
- Constraint 14: in front of red_door_1 (step13), then earlier state had holding something (step12) or in front of red_box_1 (step5). Both are true.

Now, let's check if all steps are valid:

Step1: gotoempty in room_2. Valid as preconditions for gotoempty are met (anytime).
Step2: gotodoor red_door_2 room_2 room_4. Precondition: agent is in room_2 (yes), and no object blocking door in room_2. Assuming no objects block red_door_2 in room_2. Initial state has red_ball_1 in room_2, but not blocking the door. So allowed.
Step3: toggle red_door_2. Precondition: in front of it. After step2, agent is in front of red_door_2, so allowed. Toggles it to unlocked.
Step4: gotoroom room_2 room_4 red_door_2. Preconditions: in room_2 (yes), adjacent to room_4 via red_door_2, and door is unlocked (step3). Valid. Now in room_4.
Step5: gotoobject red_box_1 room_4. Valid as in room_4 and object is there.
Step6: pick red_box_1 room_4. Preconditions: in room_4, not holding anything (after step4, agent is not holding anything). Valid. Now holding red_box_1.
Step7: drop red_box_1 room_4. Preconditions: holding it, and in front of empty. But after step6, the agent is no longer in front of red_box_1 (effect of pick is no longer in front). So before dropping, need to go to an empty spot. So missing a step here. Oh, right! After picking up an object, the agent is no longer in front of it. So after step6, agent is not in front of anything. To drop, they need to be in front of an empty spot. So after step6, need to gotoempty in room_4, then drop.

So revise steps:

After step6:

7. gotoempty room_4
8. drop red_box_1 room_4 (now holding nothing)
9. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_3
10. toggle yellow_door_1 (unlock)
11. gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_1 (now in room3)
12. gotoobject purple_box_2 room3
13. pick purple_box_2 room3 (now holding)
14. gotodoor red_door_1 room3 room1
15. toggle red_door_1 (unlock)
16. Now in front of red_door_1, unlocked.

But this adds steps. Also, after dropping red_box_1 in room4, the agent is in front of empty. Then proceed to yellow_door_1.

This makes the plan longer. So initial plan may not account for needing to gotoempty before dropping.

But the problem requires an optimal (shortest) plan. So perhaps there's a way to avoid dropping red_box_1. For example, after picking up red_box_1 (step6), can the agent carry it to room3 and then drop it there, but then pick up purple_box_2?

But steps:

6. pick red_box_1 room4
7. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room4 room3
8. toggle yellow_door_1 (unlock)
9. gotoroom room4 room3 yellow_door_1 (now in room3)
10. drop red_box_1 room3 (needs to be in front of empty)
11. gotoempty room3
12. drop red_box_1 room3 (now not holding)
13. gotoobject purple_box_2 room3
14. pick purple_box_2 room3
15. gotodoor red_door_1 room3 room1
16. toggle red_door_1

This adds more steps. But the agent needs to drop red_box_1 before picking up purple_box_2. Alternatively, after step6, the agent can go to yellow_door_1, unlock it, move to room3, then drop red_box_1 there, but that requires extra steps.

But in the initial revised plan, the agent drops red_box_1 in room4 after picking it up. So let's adjust:

Original steps with corrections:

1. gotoempty (room2)
2. gotodoor red_door_2 room2 room4
3. toggle red_door_2
4. gotoroom room2 room4 red_door_2 (now in room4)
5. gotoobject red_box_1 room4
6. pick red_box_1 room4
7. gotoempty room4 (new step)
8. drop red_box_1 room4
9. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room4 room3
10. toggle yellow_door_1
11. gotoroom room4 room3 yellow_door_1 (room3)
12. gotoobject purple_box_2 room3
13. pick purple_box_2 room3
14. gotodoor red_door_1 room3 room1
15. toggle red_door_1

Now, steps 1-15. But this is quite lengthy. Is there a way to avoid dropping red_box_1?

Alternatively, after picking up red_box_1 (step6), can the agent carry it to room3, and then use it somehow? But the agent needs to hold purple_box_2 as well, which requires dropping red_box_1 first.

Hmm. This is getting complicated. Maybe the optimal plan requires picking up purple_box_2 and red_box_1 in separate steps, but with minimal backtracking.

Alternatively, perhaps the agent can go to room4, pick up red_box_1, then go to room3, drop it, pick up purple_box_2, then proceed.

But that adds steps. However, the constraints require holding both objects at some point. So maybe the minimal plan would include:

1. gotoempty (room2)
2. gotodoor red_door_2 room2 room4
3. toggle red_door_2
4. gotoroom room2 room4 red_door_2 (room4)
5. gotoobject red_box_1 room4
6. pick red_box_1 room4 (hold it)
7. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room4 room3
8. toggle yellow_door_1 (unlock)
9. gotoroom room4 room3 yellow_door_1 (room3)
10. gotoempty room3
11. drop red_box_1 room3 (now not holding)
12. gotoobject purple_box_2 room3
13. pick purple_box_2 room3 (hold it)
14. gotodoor red_door_1 room3 room1
15. toggle red_door_1 (unlock)

This plan has 15 steps, but maybe it's necessary. However, let's check all constraints again with this plan.

- Constraint 4: holding red_box_1 in step6: yes.
- Constraint 1: holding purple_box_2 in step13: yes.
- Constraint 12: step13 (holding) and step12 (in front) both occur.
- Constraint 5: step6 (holding red_box_1) satisfies "holding some object", which is part of the condition (either in front of red_box_1 or holding purple_box_2). But step5 is gotoobject red_box_1, so in front of it. So step5 also satisfies condition5.
- Constraint 10: when red_door_1 is unlocked (step15), earlier state has holding something (step6 and step13). Yes.
- Constraint 14: in front of red_door_1 (step14), earlier states include step6 (holding red_box_1) and step13 (holding purple_box_2). So yes.
- Constraint 3: blue_door_1 remains locked, and yellow_door_1 is unlocked in step8, so satisfies "if blue_door_1 is locked, then yellow_door_1 is unlocked after".

Now, the goal is achieved in step15: in front of red_door_1 (room3 side), which is red, connects room1 and room3, and is unlocked.

But this plan has 15 actions, but perhaps there's a shorter way. For example, after step6 (holding red_box_1), can the agent go directly to room3 without dropping it, then drop it there, pick up purple_box_2, and proceed. But that would require:

Steps:

1. gotoempty
2. gotodoor red_door_2 room2 room4
3. toggle
4. gotoroom room2 room4
5. gotoobject red_box_1
6. pick
7. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room4 room3
8. toggle
9. gotoroom room4 room3 (now in room3, holding red_box_1)
10. gotoempty room3
11. drop red_box_1
12. gotoobject purple_box_2
13. pick
14. gotodoor red_door_1 room3 room1
15. toggle

This is the same as before, 15 steps. But maybe there's a way to optimize.

Alternatively, after step6 (holding red_box_1), instead of going to room3 immediately, maybe the agent can go to room2 again, but that's blocked by the constraint of never entering room1. Wait, room2 is allowed. So:

After step4 (in room4), the agent picks up red_box_1 (step5-6), then returns to room2 via red_door_2 (which is unlocked). But why? Maybe to satisfy some constraint. But I don't think so. Because constraint6 is already satisfied by the initial state. But this would add steps.

Alternatively, after step6, the agent can go to room3 via yellow_door_1 (steps7-9), then drop, pick up purple_box_2, etc.

I think the initial plan I outlined with 15 steps is necessary, given the constraints. However, perhaps there's a shorter path. For example, if after picking up red_box_1, the agent doesn't need to drop it but can proceed to room3 and then pick up purple_box_2, but since they can't hold two objects, they need to drop one. So that's unavoidable.

Another angle: constraint 5 requires that in some state, the agent is either in front of red_box_1 or holding purple_box_2. If the agent is in front of red_box_1 when they pick it up, that state satisfies the condition. So step5 (gotoobject red_box_1) is in front of it, and that state satisfies condition5. Therefore, even if the agent doesn't hold purple_box_2, as long as they are in front of red_box_1, that's enough. But the agent does hold purple_box_2 later, which also satisfies it. So constraint5 is satisfied in multiple steps.

But in the initial plan where the agent only picks up purple_box_2 and not red_box_1, that would not satisfy constraint4 (must hold red_box_1). So the agent must pick up red_box_1 at some point.

Now, putting it all together, the plan must include:

- Going to room4, picking up red_box_1.
- Going to room3, picking up purple_box_2.
- Unlocking red_door_1.

Plus all the necessary movements and toggles.

But to make this optimal, perhaps there's a way to combine some steps.

Wait, after step6 (holding red_box_1), the agent needs to go to room3. To do that, they need to unlock yellow_door_1. So:

7. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room4 room3
8. toggle yellow_door_1 (unlock)
9. gotoroom room4 room3 yellow_door_1 (now in room3, holding red_box_1)
10. drop red_box_1 room3 (requires being in front of empty)
11. gotoempty room3
12. drop red_box_1 room3
13. gotoobject purple_box_2 room3
14. pick purple_box_2 room3
15. gotodoor red_door_1 room3 room1
16. toggle red_door_1

But step9: after moving to room3, the agent is not in front of anything. To drop red_box_1, they need to be in front of an empty spot. So step10: gotoempty, then drop.

This adds steps, but perhaps it's unavoidable.

Alternatively, after step9 (in room3, holding red_box_1), can the agent directly drop it without gotoempty? No, because the drop action requires that the position in front is empty. Since after moving to room3, the agent is not in front of anything. So they need to first gotoempty, then drop.

So steps 9-12 are necessary.

This makes the plan have 16 steps. But maybe there's a way to optimize.

Wait, when the agent is in room4 and holding red_box_1 (step6), can they go to the yellow_door_1 in room4 without dropping it?

Yes:

7. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room4 room3 (precondition: in room4, which is connected via yellow_door_1. Also, no object blocking the door. Assuming the initial objects don't block doors.)

8. toggle yellow_door_1 (unlock)

9. gotoroom room4 room3 yellow_door_1 (now in room3, holding red_box_1)

10. gotoempty room3

11. drop red_box_1 room3

12. gotoobject purple_box_2 room3

13. pick purple_box_2

14. gotodoor red_door_1 room3 room1

15. toggle red_door_1

This would be 15 steps, which seems more optimized. Let's check:

Step-by-step:

1. gotoempty (room2) → front of empty
2. gotodoor red_door_2 room2 room4
3. toggle red_door_2 → unlocked
4. gotoroom room2 room4 red_door_2 → in room4
5. gotoobject red_box_1 room4
6. pick red_box_1 → holding it
7. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room4 room3
8. toggle yellow_door_1 → unlocked
9. gotoroom room4 room3 yellow_door_1 → in room3
10. gotoempty room3 → front of empty
11. drop red_box_1 room3 → now not holding
12. gotoobject purple_box_2 room3 → front of it
13. pick purple_box_2 → holding
14. gotodoor red_door_1 room3 room1 → front of door
15. toggle red_door_1 → unlocked

This plan has 15 steps and satisfies all constraints. Let's verify each constraint again:

1. Holding purple_box_2 in step13: yes.
2. blue_door_1 is locked initially, so yes.
3. blue_door_1 remains locked, yellow_door_1 is unlocked in step8: yes.
4. Holding red_box_1 in step6: yes.
5. In step5, in front of red_box_1; step13, holding purple_box_2: yes.
6. Initial state in room_2: yes.
7. In room_2 (step1), after step1, in front of empty: yes.
8. In room_4 in step4 and after: yes.
9. red_door_1 unlocked in step15: yes.
10. When red_door_1 is unlocked (step15), earlier states holding red_box_1 (step6) and purple_box_2 (step13): yes.
11. Never in room_1: correct.
12. Holding purple_box_2 (step13) or in front of it (step12): yes.
13. In front of red_door_1 in step14: yes.
14. When in front of red_door_1 (step14), earlier states holding red_box_1 (step6) and purple_box_2 (step13): yes.

All constraints are satisfied. This plan has 15 actions. Is there a shorter way?

Another thought: after step9 (in room3 holding red_box_1), instead of dropping it, can the agent proceed to toggle red_door_1? No, because they need to be in front of red_door_1 to toggle it. So steps:

9. In room3 holding red_box_1.
10. gotoobject red_door_1 room3 room1 → preconditions: in room3 (yes), door connects room3 and room1 (yes), no objects blocking. Assuming no blocking, then yes.
11. toggle red_door_1 → unlock. Now, the agent is in front of red_door_1, which is unlocked. But they're holding red_box_1. The goal requires being in front of d (red_door_1), d is red, connected to room1 and room3, and unlocked. So this would satisfy the goal. However, the agent is holding red_box_1, which isn't a problem. But also, the agent needs to have held purple_box_2 at some point (constraint1) and be in front of purple_box_2 or holding it (constraint12).

So if the agent skips picking up purple_box_2, they would violate constraints1 and 12. So they must pick up purple_box_2. Thus, even if they toggle red_door_1 while holding red_box_1, they still need to handle purple_box_2.

So this approach doesn't work. They must pick up purple_box_2.

Therefore, the earlier plan with 15 steps is necessary. But wait, after step9 (room3, holding red_box_1), can the agent gotoobject purple_box_2 directly? No, because they are holding red_box_1. To pick up purple_box_2, they need to drop red_box_1 first. So:

9. In room3, holding red_box_1.
10. gotoempty room3
11. drop red_box_1
12. gotoobject purple_box_2
13. pick
14. gotodoor red_door_1
15. toggle

This is 15 steps. So it's the same length as before.

Thus, this seems to be the optimal plan.
