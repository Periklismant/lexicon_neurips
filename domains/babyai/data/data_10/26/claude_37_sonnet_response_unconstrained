Let's analyze the problem and formulate a plan:

The goal is to achieve the state where:
- There is a red door connecting room_1 and room_3
- I am in front of that door
- The door is not locked

From the initial state, I can see:
- I am in room_2
- There's a red door (red_door_1) connecting room_1 and room_3, which is currently locked
- All doors are locked initially

To achieve the goal, I need to:
1. Go to the red door that connects room_1 and room_3 (red_door_1)
2. Make sure I'm in front of it
3. Unlock it by toggling it

Let's reason step by step. From room_2, I need to get to either room_1 or room_3 in order to reach the red door that connects these rooms. But there's a challenge - all doors are locked initially.

From room_2:
- I can access room_1 via blue_door_1 (locked)
- I can access room_4 via red_door_2 (locked)

Let's plan the sequence of actions:

1. First, I need to go to the blue door that connects room_2 and room_1
2. Toggle that door to unlock it
3. Go to room_1
4. Go to the red door that connects room_1 and room_3
5. Toggle that door to unlock it
6. The goal is achieved (I'll be in front of the red door connecting room_1 and room_3, and the door will be unlocked)

Now let's write this as a proper action sequence:

```
gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1
toggle blue_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_1 blue_door_1
gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3
toggle red_door_1
```

Let me check if this plan meets the requirements:

After executing this plan:
- I'll be in room_1
- I'll be in front of red_door_1
- red_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3
- red_door_1 will be unlocked
- red_door_1 is red

This seems to satisfy the goal conditions.

Let me double-check the preconditions for each action:

1. "gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1"
   - I'm in room_2 ✓
   - blue_door_1 connects room_2 and room_1 ✓
   - No object blocks the position in front of blue_door_1 (not specified otherwise) ✓

2. "toggle blue_door_1"
   - I'm in front of blue_door_1 ✓

3. "gotoroom room_2 room_1 blue_door_1"
   - I'm in room_2 ✓
   - blue_door_1 connects room_2 and room_1 ✓
   - blue_door_1 is unlocked (after the toggle) ✓

4. "gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3"
   - I'm in room_1 ✓
   - red_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3 ✓
   - No object blocks the position in front of red_door_1 (not specified otherwise) ✓

5. "toggle red_door_1"
   - I'm in front of red_door_1 ✓

All preconditions seem to be met. The plan appears valid.

Let me just double-check if there's an even more optimal solution. The plan I formulated has 5 actions, which seems minimal for achieving the goal from the given initial state.

I think this is the optimal plan. Let me write it in the requested format:

```
gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1
toggle blue_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_1 blue_door_1
gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3
toggle red_door_1
```

Wait, let me double-check if the goal actually requires me to be in room_1 or if I just need to be in front of the red door connecting room_1 and room_3. The goal states "you are in front of d", but doesn't specify which room I need to be in.

The goal says: "There is a door d such that "The following conditions are all true: "d is red", "room_1 and room_3 are connected via d", "you are in front of d", "d is not locked"""

This means:
- I need to be in front of a red door
- That door must connect room_1 and room_3
- The door must be unlocked

From the description, "gotodoor" action seems to require me to be in one of the rooms that the door connects. So I can be in either room_1 or room_3 to be in front of red_door_1.

My plan puts me in room_1, in front of red_door_1, and the door will be unlocked. This should satisfy the goal.

Actually, wait, let me make sure I'm reading the action descriptions correctly, particularly about being "in front of" a door.

For "gotodoor d r1 r2", the precondition says: "you may only go in front of a door d if (i) you are in a room which door d is connecting with another room, and (ii) there is no object blocking the position in front of d in the room you are currently in."

This means I need to be in either room_1 or room_3 to go in front of red_door_1, and there shouldn't be any object blocking it.

For the effect, it says: "After performing this action regarding a door d, (i) if you were in front of some object or door x0, then you are no longer in front of x0 and (ii) you are in front of door d."

So after executing "gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3", I will be in front of red_door_1, which is what the goal requires.

I believe my plan is correct and optimal:

```
gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1
toggle blue_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_1 blue_door_1
gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3
toggle red_door_1
```
