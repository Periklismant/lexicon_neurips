Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. The goal is to get to a red door connecting room_1 and room_3, be in front of it, and have it unlocked. The initial state has all doors locked. The relevant doors here are red_door_1, which connects room_1 and room_3. So the target door must be red_door_1.

First, I'm in room_2. To get to red_door_1, which is between room_1 and room_3, I need to reach room_1 or room_3. Let's see the connections. From room_2, the doors are blue_door_1 to room_1 and red_door_2 to room_4. Both are locked. So I can't go through them yet. Wait, but all doors are locked initially. So I need to unlock them. But to toggle a door, I need to be in front of it. But how do I get there if the doors are locked?

Wait, the preconditions for gotodoor: I can go in front of a door d if I'm in a room connected by d, and there's no object blocking the position in front of d. So even if the door is locked, I can go in front of it as long as the path isn't blocked. Then, once in front, I can toggle it to unlock.

So maybe I can first go to the door in the current room. Let's see. In room_2, the doors are blue_door_1 (connecting to room_1) and red_door_2 (connecting to room_4). But blue_door_1 is in room_2, so I can goto that door. Are there any objects blocking it? The initial state in room_2 has red_ball_1. Where is it placed? If the red_ball_1 is blocking the position in front of blue_door_1, then I can't go there. But the problem says objects may block doors. Wait, the effect of drop is that if the object was blocking a door, it's no longer blocking. But in the initial state, are any objects blocking doors?

The initial state doesn't mention any objects blocking doors. So maybe the doors are not blocked. Therefore, in room_2, I can go to blue_door_1. Let's check: "goto door d r1 r2" requires that I'm in a room connected by d (yes, room_2 is connected via blue_door_1 to room_1), and no object is blocking the position in front of d in the current room. Since initial state doesn't mention any blocking, maybe it's allowed.

So action: gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1. Then, toggle blue_door_1 to unlock it. Then, go to room_1 via blue_door_1. Once in room_1, the doors there are blue_door_1 (to room_2) and red_door_1 (to room_3). So I can then go to red_door_1 in room_1. Then toggle it to unlock. Then, be in front of it. That would satisfy the goal: red door (red_door_1), connects room_1 and room_3, in front of it, and unlocked.

But let's check the steps.

Starting in room_2.

1. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1. (This is allowed if no object is blocking. Assuming no, proceed.)

2. toggle blue_door_1. Now it's unlocked.

3. gotoroom room_2 room_1 blue_door_1. Now I'm in room_1.

4. gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3. (Check if possible: in room_1, which is connected via red_door_1 to room_3. Any object blocking? In room_1, there's purple_box_1 and blue_box_1. Are they blocking the door? If not, then can proceed.

5. toggle red_door_1. Now it's unlocked.

Now, after step 5, the door is unlocked. Then, the agent is in front of red_door_1. So the goal would be achieved. So the plan would be:

goto door blue_door_1 room_2 room_1

toggle blue_door_1

go to room_1 via blue_door_1

goto door red_door_1 room_1 room_3

toggle red_door_1

So the sequence would be:

Action 1: gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1

Action 2: toggle blue_door_1

Action 3: gotoroom room_2 room_1 blue_door_1

Action 4: gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3

Action 5: toggle red_door_1

After step 5, the agent is in front of red_door_1, which is red, connects room_1 and room_3, and is unlocked. That meets the goal.

But wait, after step 3 (gotoroom room_2 room_1 blue_door_1), the agent is in room_1. Then, when they perform gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3, they are in front of the door. Then toggle it. So yes, that's correct.

So the plan would be these five actions. Let's check if there's any shorter path. For example, can we get to room_1 via another door? But from room_2, the only door is blue_door_1 and red_door_2. To reach room_1, only blue_door_1 is possible. So yes, must unlock that door first. Then proceed.

Alternatively, maybe another path. Suppose the agent can go to room_4 via red_door_2, but that's locked. To unlock red_door_2, they need to be in front of it. But room_2 has red_door_2 connecting to room_4. So:

goto red_door_2 in room_2, toggle it, then go to room_4. Then from room_4, go to room_3 via yellow_door_1, but that's locked. So that's longer. So the original path is better.

So the plan is as outlined. Let's write the actions step by step.
