Let's carefully analyze the problem and design a plan to satisfy the goal and all the constraints.

The goal is: "There is a box v such that 'The following conditions are all true: 'v is yellow', 'you are in front of v'"

So, we need to be in front of a yellow box. We have several yellow boxes to choose from:
- yellow_box_1 in room_1
- yellow_box_2 in room_2
- yellow_box_3 in room_3

Now let's go through the constraints:

1. "The following expression must hold in every state: 'red_door_2 is locked'"
   - We can never unlock red_door_2, which connects room_2 and room_4.

2. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'you are in room_4'"
   - We start in room_4, so this constraint is already satisfied.

3. "If expression 'you are in room_4' holds in some state s, then expression 'At least one of the following conditions is true: 'you are holding grey_box_1', 'red_door_3 is not locked' must hold at s or at some state after s"
   - Since we start in room_4, we must either pick up grey_box_1 or unlock red_door_3 at some point.

4. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'you are in room_2'"
   - We need to visit room_2 at some point.

5. "If expression 'you are in room_2' holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: 'you are in front of red_door_3'"
   - Before we enter room_2, we must be in front of red_door_3 (which connects room_3 and room_4).

6. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'grey_box_1 is in room_1'"
   - We need to move grey_box_1 from room_4 to room_1 at some point.

7. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'At least one of the following conditions is true: 'grey_box_1 is in room_1', 'you are in front of blue_door_1'"
   - We either need to put grey_box_1 in room_1 or be in front of blue_door_1 (which connects room_1 and room_3).

8. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'At least one of the following conditions is true: 'you are in front of red_ball_1', 'you are holding some object'"
   - We either need to be in front of red_ball_1 or be holding some object.

9. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'you are in front of red_box_1'"
   - We need to be in front of red_box_1, which is in room_2.

10. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'you are holding yellow_box_3'"
    - We need to pick up yellow_box_3, which is in room_3.

11. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'The following conditions are all true: 'you are in front of grey_box_1', 'you are holding some object'"
    - We need to be in front of grey_box_1 while holding some object.

12. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'yellow_box_2 is in room_3'"
    - We need to move yellow_box_2 from room_2 to room_3.

Let's think about this step by step:

1. We start in room_4.
2. We must pick up grey_box_1 or unlock red_door_3 (constraint 3). Let's choose to pick up grey_box_1.
3. Before going to room_2, we must be in front of red_door_3 (constraint 5). So we need to go to red_door_3.
4. We need to unlock red_door_3 to leave room_4 (since we can't use red_door_2 as it must remain locked).
5. We need to go to room_3, then pick up yellow_box_3 (constraint 10).
6. We need to move yellow_box_2 to room_3 (constraint 12), which means we need to go to room_2 first.
7. We need to be in front of red_box_1 in room_2 (constraint 9).
8. We need to move grey_box_1 to room_1 (constraint 6).
9. Finally, we need to be in front of a yellow box for the goal.

Let's try to design a plan:

1. We start in room_4.
2. Go in front of grey_box_1 and pick it up (satisfies constraint 11 if we do this while holding something else, which we'll handle).
3. Go in front of red_door_3 and unlock it (satisfies constraint 3).
4. Go to room_3.
5. Drop grey_box_1 in room_3.
6. Go in front of yellow_box_3 and pick it up (satisfies constraint 10).
7. Go in front of red_door_3.
8. Go to room_4.
9. Go in front of red_ball_1 (satisfies constraint 8, since we're holding yellow_box_3).
10. Go in front of red_door_3.
11. Go to room_3.
12. Go in front of blue_door_1 (satisfies constraint 7, since we're in front of blue_door_1).
13. Unlock blue_door_1.
14. Go to room_1.
15. Drop yellow_box_3 in room_1.
16. Go in front of grey_box_1 (which we moved to room_3 earlier).
17. Pick up grey_box_1.
18. Go to room_1 (via blue_door_1).
19. Drop grey_box_1 in room_1 (satisfies constraint 6).
20. Go in front of yellow_box_1 (satisfies the goal).

Wait, I think I made an error in my reasoning. Let's reconsider:

1. We start in room_4 with grey_box_1, blue_box_1, and red_ball_1.
2. We need to pick up grey_box_1 or unlock red_door_3 (constraint 3). Let's go with unlocking red_door_3.
3. We need to be in front of red_door_3 before going to room_2 (constraint 5).
4. We need to go to room_3 and pick up yellow_box_3 (constraint 10).
5. We need to go to room_2 and be in front of red_box_1 (constraint 9).
6. We need to pick up yellow_box_2 from room_2 and move it to room_3 (constraint 12).
7. We need to move grey_box_1 to room_1 (constraint 6).
8. We need to be in front of a yellow box for the goal.

Let's try again:

1. Go in front of red_door_3.
2. Unlock red_door_3 (satisfies constraint 3).
3. Go to room_3.
4. Go in front of yellow_box_3 and pick it up (satisfies constraint 10).
5. Go in front of blue_door_1 (satisfies constraint 7, since we'll later move grey_box_1 to room_1).
6. Unlock blue_door_1.
7. Go to room_1.
8. Drop yellow_box_3 in room_1.
9. Go in front of yellow_box_1 (satisfies the goal).
10. Go in front of blue_door_1.
11. Go to room_3.
12. Go in front of red_door_3.
13. Go to room_4.
14. Go in front of grey_box_1.
15. Pick up grey_box_1 (satisfies constraint 8, since we're holding an object).
16. Go in front of red_door_3.
17. Go to room_3.
18. Go in front of blue_door_1.
19. Go to room_1.
20. Drop grey_box_1 in room_1 (satisfies constraint 6).
21. Go in front of yellow_box_1 (satisfies the goal).

Wait, I'm still missing some constraints. Let me be more methodical and reanalyze:

1. Constraint 1: "red_door_2 is locked" in every state (already satisfied, we won't touch it).
2. Constraint 2: "you are in room_4" in at least one state (already satisfied, we start there).
3. Constraint 3: If "you are in room_4", then at some later point "you are holding grey_box_1" or "red_door_3 is not locked".
4. Constraint 4: "you are in room_2" in at least one state.
5. Constraint 5: Before "you are in room_2", "you are in front of red_door_3".
6. Constraint 6: "grey_box_1 is in room_1" in at least one state.
7. Constraint 7: "grey_box_1 is in room_1" or "you are in front of blue_door_1" in at least one state.
8. Constraint 8: "you are in front of red_ball_1" or "you are holding some object" in at least one state.
9. Constraint 9: "you are in front of red_box_1" in at least one state.
10. Constraint 10: "you are holding yellow_box_3" in at least one state.
11. Constraint 11: "you are in front of grey_box_1" and "you are holding some object" in at least one state.
12. Constraint 12: "yellow_box_2 is in room_3" in at least one state.

I think my plan misses constraints 4, 9, and 12. Let me revise:

1. Go in front of red_door_3.
2. Unlock red_door_3 (satisfies constraint 3).
3. Go to room_3.
4. Go in front of yellow_box_3 and pick it up (satisfies constraint 10).
5. Go in front of red_door_1 (there's a door from room_3 to room_2?).
   Wait, I don't think there's a direct door from room_3 to room_2.
   Let me revisit the room layout.

We have doors:
- red_door_1 connects room_1 and room_2
- blue_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3
- red_door_2 connects room_2 and room_4
- red_door_3 connects room_3 and room_4

So, to go from room_3 to room_2, we need to go through either:
- room_3 -> room_1 (via blue_door_1) -> room_2 (via red_door_1), or
- room_3 -> room_4 (via red_door_3) -> room_2 (via red_door_2)

Since we can't use red_door_2 (it must stay locked), we must go through room_1.

Revising again:

1. Go in front of red_door_3.
2. Unlock red_door_3 (satisfies constraint 3).
3. Go to room_3.
4. Go in front of yellow_box_3 and pick it up (satisfies constraint 10 and 8).
5. Go in front of blue_door_1 (satisfies constraint 7).
6. Unlock blue_door_1.
7. Go to room_1.
8. Go in front of red_door_1.
9. Unlock red_door_1.
10. Go to room_2 (satisfies constraint 4).
11. Go in front of red_box_1 (satisfies constraint 9).
12. Go in front of yellow_box_2 and pick it up (we're still holding yellow_box_3 from earlier, so we need to drop it first).
    Wait, that's a problem. We can only hold one object at a time. Let me revise the plan again.

1. Go in front of red_door_3.
2. Unlock red_door_3 (satisfies constraint 3).
3. Go to room_3.
4. Go in front of blue_door_1 (satisfies constraint 7).
5. Unlock blue_door_1.
6. Go to room_1.
7. Go in front of red_door_1.
8. Unlock red_door_1.
9. Go to room_2 (satisfies constraint 4).
10. Go in front of red_box_1 (satisfies constraint 9).
11. Go in front of yellow_box_2.
12. Pick up yellow_box_2 (satisfies constraint 8).
13. Go in front of red_door_1.
14. Go to room_1.
15. Go in front of blue_door_1.
16. Go to room_3.
17. Drop yellow_box_2 in room_3 (satisfies constraint 12).
18. Go in front of yellow_box_3.
19. Pick up yellow_box_3 (satisfies constraint 10).
20. Go in front of blue_door_1.
21. Go to room_1.
22. Go in front of yellow_box_1 (satisfies the goal).
23. Go to room_4 (we still need to satisfy constraint 11).
24. Go in front of grey_box_1.
25. Drop yellow_box_3.
26. Pick up grey_box_1.
27. Go in front of yellow_box_3 (satisfies constraint 11).
28. Pick up yellow_box_3.
29. Drop grey_box_1.
30. Go in front of red_door_3.
31. Go to room_3.
32. Go in front of blue_door_1.
33. Go to room_1.
34. Drop yellow_box_3.
35. Go in front of red_ball_1 (satisfies constraint 8).
36. Go to room_4.
37. Go in front of grey_box_1.
38. Pick up grey_box_1.
39. Go in front of red_door_3.
40. Go to room_3.
41. Go in front of blue_door_1.
42. Go to room_1.
43. Drop grey_box_1 (satisfies constraint 6).
44. Go in front of yellow_box_1 (satisfies the goal).

I'm having a hard time organizing this correctly. Let me be more methodical and trace through the state step by step to make sure we satisfy all constraints. I'll try to find a more efficient plan.

Let me recall our start state:
- We are in room_4.
- grey_box_1, blue_box_1, red_ball_1 are in room_4.
- red_door_2 (connecting room_2 and room_4) is locked and must stay locked.
- red_door_3 (connecting room_3 and room_4) is locked.
- red_door_1 (connecting room_1 and room_2) is locked.
- blue_door_1 (connecting room_1 and room_3) is locked.

Our goal is to be in front of a yellow box.

Constraints that are already satisfied:
- Constraint 1: red_door_2 is locked (as long as we don't toggle it).
- Constraint 2: We are in room_4 (initial state).

Unsatisfied constraints:
- Constraint 3: Being in room_4, we need to either hold grey_box_1 or unlock red_door_3.
- Constraint 4: We need to be in room_2.
- Constraint 5: Before entering room_2, we need to be in front of red_door_3.
- Constraint 6: grey_box_1 needs to be in room_1.
- Constraint 7: grey_box_1 needs to be in room_1 or we need to be in front of blue_door_1.
- Constraint 8: We need to be in front of red_ball_1 or hold some object.
- Constraint 9: We need to be in front of red_box_1.
- Constraint 10: We need to hold yellow_box_3.
- Constraint 11: We need to be in front of grey_box_1 while holding some object.
- Constraint 12: yellow_box_2 needs to be in room_3.

Let's try a more systematic approach:

1. Go in front of red_ball_1 (satisfies constraint 8).
2. Go in front of grey_box_1.
3. Pick up grey_box_1 (satisfies constraint 3).
4. Go in front of red_door_3 (setting up for constraint 5).
5. Toggle red_door_3 to unlock it.
6. Go to room_3.
7. Go in front of yellow_box_3.
8. Drop grey_box_1.
9. Pick up yellow_box_3 (satisfies constraint 10).
10. Go in front of grey_box_1 (satisfies constraint 11).
11. Go in front of blue_door_1 (satisfies constraint 7).
12. Toggle blue_door_1 to unlock it.
13. Go to room_1.
14. Drop yellow_box_3.
15. Go in front of red_door_1.
16. Toggle red_door_1 to unlock it.
17. Go to room_2 (satisfies constraint 4, and we previously were in front of red_door_3, so constraint 5 is satisfied).
18. Go in front of red_box_1 (satisfies constraint 9).
19. Go in front of yellow_box_2.
20. Pick up yellow_box_2.
21. Go in front of red_door_1.
22. Go to room_1.
23. Go in front of blue_door_1.
24. Go to room_3.
25. Drop yellow_box_2 (satisfies constraint 12).
26. Go back to room_1 (via blue_door_1).
27. Go in front of yellow_box_3 (satisfies the goal).
28. Wait, we still need to move grey_box_1 to room_1 (constraint 6). Let's fix that:
29. Go to room_3 (via blue_door_1).
30. Go in front of grey_box_1.
31. Pick up grey_box_1.
32. Go in front of blue_door_1.
33. Go to room_1.
34. Drop grey_box_1 (satisfies constraint 6).
35. Go in front of yellow_box_3 (satisfies the goal).

Let me double-check:
- Constraint 1: red_door_2 remains locked (satisfied).
- Constraint 2: We start in room_4 (satisfied).
- Constraint 3: We pick up grey_box_1 in room_4 (satisfied).
- Constraint 4: We enter room_2 (satisfied).
- Constraint 5: We are in front of red_door_3 before entering room_2 (satisfied).
- Constraint 6: We move grey_box_1 to room_1 (satisfied).
- Constraint 7: We are in front of blue_door_1 (satisfied).
- Constraint 8: We are in front of red_ball_1 (satisfied).
- Constraint 9: We are in front of red_box_1 (satisfied).
- Constraint 10: We hold yellow_box_3 (satisfied).
- Constraint 11: We are in front of grey_box_1 while holding yellow_box_3 (satisfied).
- Constraint 12: We move yellow_box_2 to room_3 (satisfied).
- Goal: We end up in front of yellow_box_3 in room_1 (satisfied).

I'm missing something in the plan: we don't take grey_box_1 to room_3 in the first place. Here's the corrected version:

1. Go in front of red_ball_1 (satisfies constraint 8).
2. Go in front of grey_box_1.
3. Pick up grey_box_1 (satisfies constraint 3).
4. Go in front of red_door_3 (setting up for constraint 5).
5. Toggle red_door_3 to unlock it.
6. Go to room_3.
7. Drop grey_box_1.
8. Go in front of yellow_box_3.
9. Pick up yellow_box_3 (satisfies constraint 10).
10. Go in front of grey_box_1 (satisfies constraint 11).
11. Go in front of blue_door_1 (satisfies constraint 7).
12. Toggle blue_door_1 to unlock it.
13. Go to room_1.
14. Drop yellow_box_3.
15. Go in front of red_door_1.
16. Toggle red_door_1 to unlock it.
17. Go to room_2 (satisfies constraint 4, and we previously were in front of red_door_3, so constraint 5 is satisfied).
18. Go in front of red_box_1 (satisfies constraint 9).
19. Go in front of yellow_box_2.
20. Pick up yellow_box_2.
21. Go in front of red_door_1.
22. Go to room_1.
23. Go in front of blue_door_1.
24. Go to room_3.
25. Drop yellow_box_2 (satisfies constraint 12).
26. Go in front of grey_box_1.
27. Pick up grey_box_1.
28. Go in front of blue_door_1.
29. Go to room_1.
30. Drop grey_box_1 (satisfies constraint 6).
31. Go in front of yellow_box_3 (satisfies the goal).

Let me do a final check of the modified plan:
- Constraint 1: red_door_2 remains locked (satisfied).
- Constraint 2: We start in room_4 (satisfied).
- Constraint 3: We pick up grey_box_1 in room_4 (satisfied).
- Constraint 4: We enter room_2 (satisfied).
- Constraint 5: We are in front of red_door_3 before entering room_2 (satisfied).
- Constraint 6: We move grey_box_1 to room_1 (satisfied).
- Constraint 7: We are in front of blue_door_1 (satisfied).
- Constraint 8: We are in front of red_ball_1 (satisfied).
- Constraint 9: We are in front of red_box_1 (satisfied).
- Constraint 10: We hold yellow_box_3 (satisfied).
- Constraint 11: We are in front of grey_box_1 while holding yellow_box_3 (satisfied).
- Constraint 12: We move yellow_box_2 to room_3 (satisfied).
- Goal: We end up in front of yellow_box_3 in room_1 (satisfied).

I believe this plan satisfies all constraints and achieves the goal. Let me finalize it with the precise action formulation:

```
gotoobject red_ball_1 room_4
gotoobject grey_box_1 room_4
pick grey_box_1 room_4
gotodoor red_door_3 room_4 room_3
toggle red_door_3
gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_3
gotoempty
drop grey_box_1 room_3
gotoobject yellow_box_3 room_3
pick yellow_box_3 room_3
gotoobject grey_box_1 room_3
gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_1
toggle blue_door_1
gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_1
gotoempty
drop yellow_box_3 room_1
gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_2
toggle red_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_2 red_door_1
gotoobject red_box_1 room_2
gotoobject yellow_box_2 room_2
pick yellow_box_2 room_2
gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_1
gotoroom room_2 room_1 red_door_1
gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_3
gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_1
gotoempty
drop yellow_box_2 room_3
gotoobject grey_box_1 room_3
pick grey_box_1 room_3
gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_1
gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_1
gotoempty
drop grey_box_1 room_1
gotoobject yellow_box_3 room_1
```

Actually, I see an inconsistency: after dropping yellow_box_3 in room_1, we go in front of red_door_1. But I'm not sure if the plan is explicit about whether the room is empty at that position. Let me be more careful with the gotoempty and drop steps:

```
gotoobject red_ball_1 room_4
gotoobject grey_box_1 room_4
pick grey_box_1 room_4
gotodoor red_door_3 room_4 room_3
toggle red_door_3
gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_3
gotoempty
drop grey_box_1 room_3
gotoobject yellow_box_3 room_3
pick yellow_box_3 room_3
gotoobject grey_box_1 room_3
gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_1
toggle blue_door_1
gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_1
gotoempty
drop yellow_box_3 room_1
gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_2
toggle red_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_2 red_door_1
gotoobject red_box_1 room_2
gotoobject yellow_box_2 room_2
pick yellow_box_2 room_2
gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_1
gotoroom room_2 room_1 red_door_1
gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_3
gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_1
gotoempty
drop yellow_box_2 room_3
gotoobject grey_box_1 room_3
pick grey_box_1 room_3
gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_1
gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_1
gotoempty
drop grey_box_1 room_1
gotoobject yellow_box_3 room_1
```

That looks okay. This plan satisfies all the constraints and achieves the goal.

Let me quickly double-check if this is the optimal solution (i.e., the shortest one that satisfies all constraints). I don't think there's a significantly shorter path that can satisfy all the constraints, but let me check if I've included any unnecessary steps.

The plan has 34 steps. Let me see if I can trim any:

1. We need to pick up and move grey_box_1 to room_1, which requires multiple steps.
2. We need to go to room_2 and be in front of red_box_1.
3. We need to move yellow_box_2 to room_3.
4. We need to pick up yellow_box_3.
5. We need to be in front of a yellow box at the end.

I don't see any unnecessary steps in the plan I've laid out. Each action serves a purpose in satisfying a constraint or setting up for a future constraint.

I believe this is the optimal solution to the problem.
