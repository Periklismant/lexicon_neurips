Okay, let's tackle this planning problem step by step. The goal is to get a yellow box in front of the agent. The constraints are a bit complex, so I need to make sure each one is satisfied while finding the shortest path.

First, the initial state: the agent is in room_4. The yellow boxes are in room_1 (yellow_box_1), room_2 (yellow_box_2), and room_3 (yellow_box_3). The final goal is to have a yellow box (any of them) in front of the agent. So, the agent needs to reach one of these yellow boxes and position in front of it.

But there are multiple constraints. Let's list them out:

1. red_door_2 must always be locked. So, the agent can't unlock it at any point.
2. The agent must be in room_4 at least once. Since the start is there, that's covered, but maybe needs to return.
3. If the agent is in room_4, then either they are holding grey_box_1 or red_door_3 is unlocked at that state or later.
4. Must visit room_2 at least once.
5. If in room_2, there must have been a prior state where the agent was in front of red_door_3.
6. grey_box_1 must be in room_1 at some point.
7. At some point, either grey_box_1 is in room_1 or the agent is in front of blue_door_1.
8. At some point, the agent is in front of red_ball_1 or holding an object.
9. Must be in front of red_box_1 at some point.
10. Must hold yellow_box_3 at some point.
11. At some point, be in front of grey_box_1 while holding an object.
12. yellow_box_2 must be in room_3 at some point.

So, the plan needs to satisfy all these while achieving the goal. Let's see how to integrate each constraint.

Starting in room_4. The yellow boxes in room_4 are grey_box_1 and blue_box_1, but those aren't yellow. So the agent needs to go to room_1, 2, or 3 to get a yellow box.

But let's check the constraints. The agent must end up in front of a yellow box. Let's see which yellow boxes are available:

- yellow_box_1 in room_1
- yellow_box_2 in room_2
- yellow_box_3 in room_3

To reach room_1 from room_4, the path would be room_4 to room_3 via red_door_3, then room_3 to room_1 via blue_door_1. But doors are locked initially. The doors red_door_1, blue_door_1, red_door_2, red_door_3 are all locked. So the agent needs to unlock doors to move.

But the constraints: red_door_2 must remain locked. So the agent can't use that door. So movement from room_2 to room_4 via red_door_2 is blocked. But since the agent starts in room_4, how can they get out? The doors connecting room_4 are red_door_2 (locked, must stay locked) and red_door_3 (locked). So the only way out of room_4 is through red_door_3 to room_3, but that door is locked. So the agent needs to toggle red_door_3. But to toggle a door, the agent needs to be in front of it. So first, goto red_door_3 from room_4, then toggle it to unlock. But the door is locked, so toggling will unlock it.

Wait, the effect of toggle is: if locked, unlock; if unlocked, lock. So the agent can unlock red_door_3. Then use gotoroom to move to room_3. Once in room_3, then proceed to blue_door_1, which is locked. So need to toggle that as well. But blue_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3. So in room_3, the agent can go to blue_door_1, toggle it to unlock, then go to room_1.

Alternatively, maybe there's a better path. Let's outline possible steps.

Start in room_4. Need to get to a room with a yellow box. Let's consider going to room_3 first. To do that:

1. gotoempty (since agent is in room_4, maybe needs to move to door)
But to goto door, need to be in a room connected by that door. red_door_3 connects room_4 and room_3. So agent is in room_4, can goto red_door_3. But the preconditions for gotodoor: (i) in a room connected by door d, and (ii) no object blocking the position in front of d in current room.

Are any objects blocking red_door_3 in room_4? In room_4, there's grey_box_1, blue_box_1, red_ball_1. The doors are red_door_2 (connects room_2 and room_4) and red_door_3 (connects room_4 and room_3). So the position in front of red_door_3 in room_4: is there an object there? The initial positions aren't specified, but the problem says that the preconditions for gotodoor require that there's no object blocking. So unless the initial state has objects blocking doors, which isn't mentioned, we can assume that the agent can go to the door.

So steps:

1. gotodoor red_door_3 room_4 room_3 (agent is in front of red_door_3)
2. toggle red_door_3 (unlocks it)
3. gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_3 (now in room_3)
Now, room_3 has yellow_box_3. So can pick it up. But the agent needs to be in front of it. So:

4. gotoobject yellow_box_3 room_3
5. pick yellow_box_3 room_3

But wait, after step 3, the agent is in room_3. Then they can gotoobject yellow_box_3 (since it's in room_3). Then pick it up. But then, the goal requires being in front of a yellow box. So maybe after dropping it again? Wait, the goal is to have a yellow box in front of the agent. So once the agent is in front of yellow_box_3 (step 4), that would satisfy the goal. Wait, but the goal is "There is a box v such that v is yellow and you are in front of v". So if the agent is in front of yellow_box_3, then that's achieved. But the constraints require several other things.

Wait, but the agent needs to perform actions to reach that state. So maybe the plan is to go to room_3, unlock blue_door_1, go to room_1, pick yellow_box_1, etc. But let's check the constraints.

Looking at the constraints:

Constraint 12: yellow_box_2 must be in room_3 at some point. So the agent must move yellow_box_2 from room_2 to room_3. How? The agent needs to pick it up in room_2 and drop it in room_3. But getting to room_2 from room_4: via room_4 to room_2 requires red_door_2, which is locked and must remain locked. So that's impossible. So the only way to get to room_2 is through room_1 or room_4. Wait, rooms are arranged as 1 (NW), 2 (SW), 3 (NE), 4 (SE). Doors: room_1-2 (red_door_1), 1-3 (blue_door_1), 2-4 (red_door_2), 3-4 (red_door_3). So room_2 is connected to room_1 and room_4. But red_door_2 is locked and must stay locked. So from room_2, you can't get to room_4. So agent must get to room_2 via room_1. So path from room_4 to room_3 (unlock red_door_3), then room_3 to room_1 via blue_door_1 (unlock blue_door_1), then room_1 to room_2 via red_door_1 (unlock red_door_1), then to room_2.

But let's see. To get to room_2, agent needs to go from room_1 to room_2 via red_door_1. But red_door_1 is locked. So need to unlock it.

So steps would be:

From room_4:

1. gotodoor red_door_3 room_4 room_3
2. toggle red_door_3 (unlock)
3. gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_3 (now in room_3)
4. gotoempty (to move to a position to go to blue_door_1)
5. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_1
6. toggle blue_door_1 (unlock)
7. gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_1 (now in room_1)
8. gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_2
9. toggle red_door_1 (unlock)
10. gotoroom room_1 room_2 red_door_1 (now in room_2)
Now in room_2, which has red_box_1 and yellow_box_2.

But constraint 5 says that if the agent is in room_2, there must have been a prior state where they were in front of red_door_3. Let's check: prior steps include being in front of red_door_3 (step 1). So that's satisfied.

Constraint 9: must be in front of red_box_1. So in room_2, the agent can gotoobject red_box_1 room_2. That would satisfy that.

Constraint 12: yellow_box_2 must be in room_3 at some point. So the agent needs to pick up yellow_box_2 in room_2, carry it to room_3. But how? The path back would be room_2 to room_1 via red_door_1 (unlocked), then room_1 to room_3 via blue_door_1 (unlocked). Then to room_3, drop yellow_box_2 there.

So steps after being in room_2:

11. gotoobject red_box_1 room_2 (satisfies constraint 9)
12. pick red_box_1 room_2 (but agent can't, unless they are not holding anything. Since they might have picked up yellow_box_3 earlier. Wait, no, in the current path, after step 10, agent is in room_2, not holding anything. So step 11: goto red_box_1, then step 12: pick red_box_1. But then they need to drop it somewhere? Not sure, but the constraint 9 is to be in front of red_box_1. That's satisfied by step 11.

But then the agent needs to get yellow_box_2 to room_3. So after step 10, agent is in room_2. Then:

11. gotoobject yellow_box_2 room_2
12. pick yellow_box_2 room_2 (now holding it)
Then go back to room_1 via red_door_1 (already unlocked), then to room_3 via blue_door_1, then drop in room_3.

But then:

13. gotoroom room_2 room_1 red_door_1
14. gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_1
15. gotoempty (to drop)
16. drop yellow_box_2 room_3 (now yellow_box_2 is in room_3, satisfying constraint 12)

But that's a lot of steps. Let's see if there's a better way.

Alternatively, after step 10 (agent in room_2), they need to get yellow_box_2 to room_3. So pick it up, take it to room_1, then to room_3, then drop. But that requires carrying the box through doors.

But then the agent would have to drop it in room_3. Then to achieve the goal, maybe they can go to yellow_box_3 in room_3. But the goal is to be in front of a yellow box, which can be yellow_box_3 in room_3. So maybe after moving yellow_box_2 to room_3 (to satisfy constraint 12), the agent can just go to yellow_box_3 and be in front of it.

But let's outline all the steps needed considering all constraints.

Constraints:

3. Whenever in room_4, either hold grey_box_1 or red_door_3 is unlocked. Since the agent starts in room_4, but leaves. If they return to room_4 later, they need to ensure that either they have grey_box_1 or red_door_3 is unlocked. Since red_door_3 was unlocked in step 2, but toggling it again would lock it. Wait, no. Toggling once unlocks it. If the agent toggles it again, it locks. But constraint 1 requires red_door_2 to stay locked. red_door_3 can be unlocked or locked as long as the constraint 3 is satisfied when in room_4.

So if the agent returns to room_4 after unlocking red_door_3, but then if red_door_3 is locked again, then when in room_4, they need to have grey_box_1 or red_door_3 unlocked. So perhaps after the first time they leave room_4, red_door_3 is unlocked. If they come back later, they need to make sure that if they are in room_4, either holding grey_box_1 or red_door_3 is unlocked.

But the agent starts in room_4 and leaves via red_door_3 (unlocked). Suppose they don't return. Then constraint 2 (must be in room_4 at least once) is satisfied by initial state. So no need to return. So maybe the agent doesn't have to go back to room_4. But if they do, need to handle constraint 3.

But let's see. The plan so far:

Agent starts in room_4.

1. gotodoor red_door_3 room_4 room_3
2. toggle red_door_3 (unlock)
3. gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_3 (now in room_3)
4. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_1
5. toggle blue_door_1 (unlock)
6. gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_1 (now in room_1)
7. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_1
8. pick yellow_box_1 room_1 (now holding it)
But the goal is to be in front of a yellow box. If the agent is in front of yellow_box_1 and picks it up, then they are no longer in front of it. So maybe better to just be in front of it without picking. Wait, the goal is "there exists a box v that is yellow and you are in front of v". So if the agent is in front of yellow_box_1 (step 7), then the goal is achieved. But wait, step 7 is before picking. So if the agent stops there, but then the plan must include the action that results in being in front of the yellow box. So the plan would end at step 7. But there are other constraints that must be satisfied.

But the problem requires that the plan brings about the goal, but also satisfies all constraints. So even if the goal is achieved early, the rest of the constraints must be met.

But let's check all constraints.

Constraint 6: grey_box_1 must be in room_1 at some state. So we need to move grey_box_1 from room_4 to room_1. How? The agent is in room_1 (step 6), but grey_box_1 is in room_4. So the agent must go back to room_4, pick up grey_box_1, and bring it to room_1.

But to get back to room_4, the agent would have to go through room_3 and red_door_3. But when they left room_4, red_door_3 was unlocked. If they go back, they can use red_door_3. So steps:

From room_1, after step 6:

7. gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_1 (back to room_3)
8. gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_3 (back to room_4)
Now in room_4, which has grey_box_1. Then:

9. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_4
10. pick grey_box_1 room_4 (now holding it)
11. gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_3
12. gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_1
13. drop grey_box_1 room_1 (now grey_box_1 is in room_1, satisfying constraint 6)

But this adds more steps. Also, when the agent is back in room_4 (step 8), they must satisfy constraint 3: if in room_4, then either holding grey_box_1 or red_door_3 is unlocked. At step 8, the agent is in room_4. red_door_3 was unlocked in step 2. Unless they toggled it again. Wait, after step 2, red_door_3 is unlocked. The agent uses it to go to room_3. Then returns via red_door_3 again. So when they come back to room_4 (step 8), red_door_3 is still unlocked. So constraint 3 is satisfied because red_door_3 is unlocked. So no problem.

But this adds several steps. However, this is necessary to meet constraint 6 (grey_box_1 in room_1).

Also, constraint 11: at some state, the agent is in front of grey_box_1 while holding an object. When the agent picks up grey_box_1 (step 10), they are in front of it and holding it. So that satisfies constraint 11.

Constraint 8: at some point, agent is in front of red_ball_1 or holding an object. Since red_ball_1 is in room_4, when the agent is in room_4 (step 8), they can gotoobject red_ball_1. But if they don't, but are holding grey_box_1 (step 10-13), then that satisfies the constraint. So holding an object during steps 10-13 covers that.

Constraint 7: at some point, grey_box_1 is in room_1 or agent is in front of blue_door_1. After step 13, grey_box_1 is in room_1, so that's satisfied.

Constraint 10: must hold yellow_box_3 at some point. Currently, the steps don't include that. So the agent needs to pick up yellow_box_3. But yellow_box_3 is in room_3. So after step 3 (in room_3), the agent can go to yellow_box_3 and pick it up. But that would require:

4. gotoobject yellow_box_3 room_3
5. pick yellow_box_3 room_3 (now holding it)
But then the agent would need to drop it somewhere. Or maybe just holding it for one step to satisfy the constraint.

But if they pick it up and then drop it, that adds steps. Alternatively, after picking yellow_box_3, the agent can carry it to room_1, then drop it. But why?

Alternatively, after step 3 (in room_3):

4. gotoobject yellow_box_3 room_3
5. pick yellow_box_3 room_3 (satisfies constraint 10)
6. drop yellow_box_3 room_3 (after maybe moving to empty)
But then the agent is holding it in step 5, which satisfies constraint 10.

But then need to proceed to unlock blue_door_1.

This adds steps but satisfies constraint 10.

So integrating this:

1. gotodoor red_door_3 room_4 room_3
2. toggle red_door_3
3. gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_3
4. gotoobject yellow_box_3 room_3
5. pick yellow_box_3 room_3 (now holding it, satisfies constraint 10)
6. drop yellow_box_3 room_3 (maybe)
Wait, but the agent needs to drop it somewhere. If they drop it in room_3, then it's back where it was, but constraint 10 is satisfied by step 5.

Alternatively, after picking it up, the agent can carry it to room_1 and drop it there. But that's more steps.

But maybe it's better to pick it up and then drop it immediately. So steps:

4. gotoobject yellow_box_3 room_3
5. pick yellow_box_3 room_3 (satisfies constraint 10)
6. gotoempty room_3 (since after picking, they are no longer in front of it)
7. drop yellow_box_3 room_3

But then the agent is back to not holding anything. But constraint 10 is satisfied in step 5.

So now, after these steps, the agent can proceed to unlock blue_door_1 and go to room_1.

But this adds steps. Let's see if all constraints are covered.

Constraint 10: holding yellow_box_3 at some point: yes, step 5.

Now, let's adjust the plan:

Original steps after starting in room_4:

1. gotodoor red_door_3 room_4 room_3
2. toggle red_door_3 (unlocks)
3. gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_3 (now in room_3)
4. gotoobject yellow_box_3 room_3
5. pick yellow_box_3 room_3 (holding it, satisfies constraint 10)
6. drop yellow_box_3 room_3 (drops it)
7. gotoempty room_3
8. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_1
9. toggle blue_door_1 (unlocks)
10. gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_1 (now in room_1)
11. gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_2
12. toggle red_door_1 (unlocks)
13. gotoroom room_1 room_2 red_door_1 (now in room_2)
14. gotoobject red_box_1 room_2 (satisfies constraint 9)
15. gotoobject yellow_box_2 room_2
16. pick yellow_box_2 room_2 (now holding it)
17. gotoroom room_2 room_1 red_door_1
18. gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_1
19. gotoempty room_3
20. drop yellow_box_2 room_3 (satisfies constraint 12)
21. gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_1
22. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_1 (now in front of yellow box, goal achieved)
But wait, the goal is to have a yellow box in front of the agent. So step 22 satisfies the goal. However, there are other constraints to check.

But we also need to move grey_box_1 to room_1 (constraint 6). So after step 22, the agent is in room_1, front of yellow_box_1. But grey_box_1 is still in room_4.

So, after achieving the goal, the agent needs to go back to room_4, get grey_box_1, and bring it to room_1. But the goal is already achieved, but the constraints must be satisfied during the entire plan. So even if the goal is achieved early, the rest of the steps must satisfy the constraints.

Alternatively, maybe the agent can pick up yellow_box_1 in room_1 and carry it somewhere, but that's not necessary for the goal.

But constraint 6 requires that grey_box_1 is in room_1 at some state. So the agent must do that before the plan ends.

So, after step 22, the agent is in front of yellow_box_1. The goal is achieved. But the plan needs to include steps to move grey_box_1 to room_1.

So perhaps after step 22, the agent can go back to room_4 via room_3:

23. gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_1
24. gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_3
25. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_4
26. pick grey_box_1 room_4 (now holding it, satisfies constraint 11 when in front of grey_box_1 and holding)
27. gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_3
28. gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_1
29. drop grey_box_1 room_1 (satisfies constraint 6)

Now, the plan has all constraints met:

- red_door_2 remains locked (never touched)
- agent is in room_4 in steps 0 and 24-27. In step 24, when agent is in room_4, red_door_3 is unlocked (step 2, toggled once). So constraint 3 satisfied.
- agent is in room_2 in step 13-17. Constraint 4 satisfied.
- constraint 5: when in room_2 (step 13), prior state in front of red_door_3 (step 1)
- constraint 6: grey_box_1 in room_1 after step 29
- constraint 7: grey_box_1 in room_1 after step 29
- constraint 8: agent holds yellow_box_3 (step 5), yellow_box_2 (step 16), grey_box_1 (step 26), etc., so satisfies holding some object
- constraint 9: in front of red_box_1 (step 14)
- constraint 10: holding yellow_box_3 (step 5)
- constraint 11: in front of grey_box_1 and holding it (step 25-26)
- constraint 12: yellow_box_2 in room_3 (step 20)

So all constraints are covered. But the plan is quite long. Is there a shorter path?

Alternative approach: Maybe instead of moving grey_box_1 to room_1, use the other part of constraint 7: "you are in front of blue_door_1". If the agent is in front of blue_door_1 at some point, that satisfies constraint 7 without needing to move grey_box_1. But that's an OR condition. So either grey_box_1 in room_1 or agent in front of blue_door_1.

If the agent goes to blue_door_1 in room_3, that would satisfy constraint 7. For example, step 8 in the earlier plan where the agent is in front of blue_door_1 in room_3 (step 8: gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_1). So that action would mean the agent is in front of blue_door_1, satisfying constraint 7. So if the agent can reach step 8 (gotodoor blue_door_1), then constraint 7 is satisfied, and there's no need to move grey_box_1 to room_1. That would save several steps.

So, let's re-examine. If the agent is in front of blue_door_1 (step 8 in the earlier plan), then constraint 7 is satisfied. Thus, we don't need to move grey_box_1 to room_1. That would save steps 23-29.

But wait, constraint 6 is "grey_box_1 is in room_1" at some state. So if we avoid moving grey_box_1, constraint 6 is not satisfied. So we can't do that. Therefore, the agent must move grey_box_1 to room_1. So that constraint is mandatory.

So regardless of other constraints, grey_box_1 must be moved to room_1. So the earlier steps involving moving grey_box_1 are necessary.

But perhaps there's a more optimal path.

Alternative idea: After unlocking red_door_3 and blue_door_1, the agent goes to room_1, picks yellow_box_1 and is in front of it (satisfying the goal), then returns to room_4, picks grey_box_1 and brings it to room_1. But this requires:

1. gotodoor red_door_3 room_4 room_3
2. toggle red_door_3
3. gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_3
4. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_1
5. toggle blue_door_1
6. gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_1
7. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_1 (goal achieved)
Now, the agent is in front of yellow_box_1. The goal is met. But need to satisfy other constraints.

But constraint 6 requires grey_box_1 to be in room_1. So after step 7, agent needs to go back to room_4, get grey_box_1, bring to room_1.

So:

8. gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_1
9. gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_3
10. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_4
11. pick grey_box_1 room_4
12. gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_3
13. gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_1
14. drop grey_box_1 room_1 (constraint 6 satisfied)
Now, grey_box_1 is in room_1.

This plan is shorter. Let's check constraints:

Constraint 3: when returning to room_4 in step 9, agent is in room_4. At that point, red_door_3 is unlocked (step 2). So constraint 3 is satisfied.

Constraint 5: agent must have been in front of red_door_3 before being in room_2. But in this plan, the agent never goes to room_2. But constraint 4 requires being in room_2 at least once. So this plan fails constraint 4. So this approach is invalid.

Ah, right. The agent must visit room_2 at least once. So the earlier plan where the agent goes to room_2 is necessary.

So the agent must go to room_2 to satisfy constraint 4. Which means the steps involving unlocking red_door_1 and moving to room_2 are required.

This complicates things. So the optimal plan must include:

- Unlock red_door_3 and blue_door_1 to get to room_1.
- Unlock red_door_1 to get to room_2.
- Move yellow_box_2 to room_3.
- Move grey_box_1 to room_1.
- Be in front of a yellow box.

This seems unavoidable given the constraints.

Putting it all together, the steps would be:

1. gotodoor red_door_3 room_4 room_3
2. toggle red_door_3 (unlocks)
3. gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_3
4. gotoobject yellow_box_3 room_3
5. pick yellow_box_3 room_3 (satisfies constraint 10)
6. drop yellow_box_3 room_3 (optional, but needed to free hands)
7. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_1
8. toggle blue_door_1 (unlocks)
9. gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_1
10. gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_2
11. toggle red_door_1 (unlocks)
12. gotoroom room_1 room_2 red_door_1 (now in room_2)
13. gotoobject red_box_1 room_2 (satisfies constraint 9)
14. gotoobject yellow_box_2 room_2
15. pick yellow_box_2 room_2
16. gotoroom room_2 room_1 red_door_1
17. gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_1
18. drop yellow_box_2 room_3 (satisfies constraint 12)
19. gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_1
20. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_1 (goal achieved)
21. gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_1
22. gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_3
23. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_4
24. pick grey_box_1 room_4 (satisfies constraint 11)
25. gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_3
26. gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_1
27. drop grey_box_1 room_1 (satisfies constraint 6)

But this is very long. Let's see if any steps can be optimized.

For example, after step 5 (pick yellow_box_3), the agent can carry it to room_1 and drop it there instead of dropping in room_3. Then, when they go to room_1, they can drop it, but that may not help.

Alternatively, perhaps after step 5, they can keep yellow_box_3 and use it to satisfy other constraints. For example, when in room_1, drop it there. But that may not help.

Alternatively, when the agent is in room_3 after step 3, instead of picking yellow_box_3, go directly to unlock blue_door_1. Then go to room_1 and pick yellow_box_1. But then constraint 10 (holding yellow_box_3) isn't satisfied. So must pick yellow_box_3.

So step 4-5 are necessary.

This suggests that the plan has to be lengthy to satisfy all constraints.

But perhaps there's a shorter path. Let's think again.

Another approach: The agent needs to get to a yellow box and be in front of it. The closest yellow box is yellow_box_3 in room_3. But to get there, the agent needs to unlock red_door_3. So steps:

1. gotodoor red_door_3 room_4 room_3
2. toggle red_door_3
3. gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_3
4. gotoobject yellow_box_3 room_3 (goal achieved)

But this plan would end here, but then many constraints are not met: visiting room_2, moving yellow_box_2 to room_3, etc.

So this is impossible. So the agent must perform additional steps.

But the problem says to provide an optimal plan, which is the shortest possible. So the challenge is to find the minimal sequence that meets all constraints and the goal.

Let me try to outline a minimal path:

1. Unlock red_door_3 and go to room_3.

2. Pick yellow_box_3 (satisfies constraint 10).

3. Unlock blue_door_1 and go to room_1.

4. Drop yellow_box_3 in room_1 (optional, but not needed for goal).

5. Unlock red_door_1 and go to room_2.

6. Be in front of red_box_1 (constraint 9).

7. Pick yellow_box_2 and move it to room_3 (constraint 12).

8. Return to room_4 to get grey_box_1 (constraint 6).

9. Move grey_box_1 to room_1.

10. Finally, go to a yellow box (like yellow_box_1 in room_1) to satisfy the goal.

But this involves many steps. Let's try to count the steps:

1. gotodoor red_door_3 room_4 room_3
2. toggle red_door_3
3. gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_3
4. gotoobject yellow_box_3 room_3
5. pick yellow_box_3 room_3
6. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_1
7. toggle blue_door_1
8. gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_1
9. drop yellow_box_3 room_1 (optional)
10. gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_2
11. toggle red_door_1
12. gotoroom room_1 room_2 red_door_1
13. gotoobject red_box_1 room_2 (constraint 9)
14. gotoobject yellow_box_2 room_2
15. pick yellow_box_2 room_2
16. gotoroom room_2 room_1 red_door_1
17. gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_1
18. drop yellow_box_2 room_3 (constraint 12)
19. gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_1
20. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_1 (goal achieved)
21. gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_1
22. gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_3
23. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_4
24. pick grey_box_1 room_4 (constraint 11)
25. gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_3
26. gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_1
27. drop grey_box_1 room_1 (constraint 6)

This is still 27 steps. There must be a smarter way.

Wait, maybe some steps can be merged. For example, after step 5 (holding yellow_box_3), instead of dropping it, the agent can carry it to room_1 and use it to satisfy some constraints. For instance, when in room_1, being in front of grey_box_1 while holding yellow_box_3. But grey_box_1 is in room_4. So that's not possible.

Alternatively, when moving grey_box_1 to room_1, the agent can pick it up while holding yellow_box_3? No, because the agent can't hold two objects. So they must drop yellow_box_3 first.

Alternatively, after moving yellow_box_2 to room_3, the agent can proceed to room_4 and pick grey_box_1, then return to room_1 via room_3 and blue_door_1.

But this still requires many steps.

Another idea: After step 18 (yellow_box_2 in room_3), the agent is in room_3. They can go to room_4 via red_door_3 (already unlocked), pick grey_box_1, and bring it to room_1. Then, go to yellow_box_1.

Steps after 18:

19. gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_3
20. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_4
21. pick grey_box_1 room_4
22. gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_3
23. gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_1
24. drop grey_box_1 room_1 (constraint 6)
25. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_1 (goal)

This reduces some steps. Let's see:

Combined plan:

1. gotodoor red_door_3 room_4 room_3
2. toggle red_door_3
3. gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_3
4. gotoobject yellow_box_3 room_3
5. pick yellow_box_3 room_3
6. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_1
7. toggle blue_door_1
8. gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_1
9. drop yellow_box_3 room_1 (maybe unnecessary)
10. gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_2
11. toggle red_door_1
12. gotoroom room_1 room_2 red_door_1
13. gotoobject red_box_1 room_2 (constraint 9)
14. gotoobject yellow_box_2 room_2
15. pick yellow_box_2 room_2
16. gotoroom room_2 room_1 red_door_1
17. gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_1
18. drop yellow_box_2 room_3 (constraint 12)
19. gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_3
20. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_4
21. pick grey_box_1 room_4 (constraint 11)
22. gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_3
23. gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_1
24. drop grey_box_1 room_1 (constraint 6)
25. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_1 (goal)

This is 25 steps. Still long, but maybe that's necessary.

But perhaps some steps can be skipped. For example, step 9 (drop yellow_box_3) is optional if the agent can proceed while holding it. But after step 5, the agent is holding yellow_box_3. To unlock blue_door_1, they need to goto door blue_door_1. To do that, they must drop the box first, because the preconditions for gotodoor don't mention holding objects, but when moving through doors, the agent can carry objects. However, the action "gotodoor" can be performed while holding an object. The preconditions for gotodoor are (i) in a room connected by the door, and (ii) no object blocking the position in front of the door. Holding an object doesn't block gotodoor.

So the agent can carry yellow_box_3 while performing gotodoor and toggle actions. So steps 6-8 can be done while holding yellow_box_3. Then, in room_1, the agent can drop it.

So:

After step 5 (pick yellow_box_3):

6. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_1 (while holding yellow_box_3)
7. toggle blue_door_1 (still holding)
8. gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_1 (still holding)
9. drop yellow_box_3 room_1 (now in room_1)

This saves a step (no need to drop and pick up again).

Then proceed to unlock red_door_1 and goto room_2.

Then, after moving yellow_box_2 to room_3 and returning to room_1, the agent can goto yellow_box_1.

Revised plan:

1. gotodoor red_door_3 room_4 room_3
2. toggle red_door_3
3. gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_3
4. gotoobject yellow_box_3 room_3
5. pick yellow_box_3 room_3
6. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_1
7. toggle blue_door_1
8. gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_1
9. drop yellow_box_3 room_1
10. gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_2
11. toggle red_door_1
12. gotoroom room_1 room_2 red_door_1
13. gotoobject red_box_1 room_2
14. gotoobject yellow_box_2 room_2
15. pick yellow_box_2 room_2
16. gotoroom room_2 room_1 red_door_1
17. gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_1
18. drop yellow_box_2 room_3
19. gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_3
20. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_4
21. pick grey_box_1 room_4
22. gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_3
23. gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_1
24. drop grey_box_1 room_1
25. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_1

This is still 25 steps. But perhaps combining steps where possible.

Wait, after step 9 (drop yellow_box_3 in room_1), the agent can immediately go to unlock red_door_1. So steps 10-12 proceed as before.

But the agent needs to visit room_2, which is done in step 12.

After moving yellow_box_2 to room_3 (step 18), then move to room_4 to get grey_box_1.

But the agent must visit room_4 again. When they do, they must satisfy constraint 3: in room_4, either holding grey_box_1 or red_door_3 is unlocked. When agent is in room_4 (step 19), red_door_3 was unlocked in step 2, so constraint 3 is satisfied.

When the agent picks grey_box_1 (step 21), they are holding it, which also satisfies constraint 3 if they are in room_4 again. But they leave room_4 after step 19.

This plan meets all constraints. However, it's still very long. Is there a way to shorten it?

Another observation: The agent needs to be in front of red_box_1 (constraint 9). This can be done when in room_2 (step 13). So that's covered.

Constraint 11: being in front of grey_box_1 and holding an object. This happens in step 20-21: gotoobject grey_box_1 (front), then pick it up (holding). So step 20: in front of grey_box_1, step 21: holding it. So constraint 11 is satisfied during step 21 (the state after picking).

Constraint 8: in front of red_ball_1 or holding an object. The agent holds objects during steps 5-9 (yellow_box_3), 15-18 (yellow_box_2), and 21-24 (grey_box_1). So constraint 8 is satisfied.

Constraint 7: grey_box_1 in room_1 or in front of blue_door_1. The agent is in front of blue_door_1 in step 6 (when toggling), so constraint 7 is satisfied there. Additionally, after step 24, grey_box_1 is in room_1.

Constraint 12: yellow_box_2 in room_3 after step 18.

Constraint 6: grey_box_1 in room_1 after step 24.

Constraint 4: visited room_2 in step 12.

Constraint 5: when in room_2 (step 12), prior state was being in front of red_door_3 (step 1).

Thus, all constraints are satisfied.

The goal is achieved at step 25: gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_1.

But is there a way to achieve the goal earlier? For example, after step 8, the agent is in room_1 with yellow_box_3. If they drop it in room_1, then gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_1. But that would achieve the goal earlier. However, they need to satisfy all constraints, including moving yellow_box_2 to room_3 and moving grey_box_1.

So perhaps the goal can be achieved earlier, but the remaining steps are still needed for constraints. For example:

After step 9 (drop yellow_box_3 in room_1), the agent can gotoobject yellow_box_1 (step 10), which achieves the goal. Then proceed to unlock red_door_1, go to room_2, etc. But the agent must then continue to satisfy the other constraints.

So the plan would look like:

1. gotodoor red_door_3 room_4 room_3
2. toggle red_door_3
3. gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_3
4. gotoobject yellow_box_3 room_3
5. pick yellow_box_3 room_3
6. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_1
7. toggle blue_door_1
8. gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_1
9. drop yellow_box_3 room_1
10. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_1 (goal achieved)
11. gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_2
12. toggle red_door_1
13. gotoroom room_1 room_2 red_door_1
14. gotoobject red_box_1 room_2
15. gotoobject yellow_box_2 room_2
16. pick yellow_box_2 room_2
17. gotoroom room_2 room_1 red_door_1
18. gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_1
19. drop yellow_box_2 room_3
20. gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_3
21. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_4
22. pick grey_box_1 room_4
23. gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_3
24. gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_1
25. drop grey_box_1 room_1

This way, the goal is achieved at step 10. The remaining steps are to meet the other constraints. But since the problem requires that the plan brings about the goal and satisfies all constraints, the plan can end once the goal is achieved and all constraints are met. However, some constraints require certain states to be true at some point in the plan, not necessarily after the goal is achieved. So the plan must include all necessary steps to meet all constraints, even after achieving the goal.

But in this case, the agent must visit room_2 (step 13) after achieving the goal. So the plan must include steps after the goal is achieved. So the total number of steps is still high.

In conclusion, given the numerous constraints, the optimal plan is lengthy but necessary. The steps must include unlocking doors, moving objects, and visiting specific rooms. The shortest possible plan would require at least 25 actions as outlined above.
