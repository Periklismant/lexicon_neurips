Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. The goal is to have a yellow box in front of me. The initial state has me in room_4, and all doors are locked. I need to figure out the steps to get to a yellow box and be in front of it.

First, looking at the objects: there are yellow boxes in room_1 (yellow_box_1), room_2 (yellow_box_2), and room_3 (yellow_box_3). The problem is that all doors are locked initially, so I need to unlock them to move between rooms. But how?

Starting in room_4, which doors connect here? From the initial state, room_4 is connected to room_2 via red_door_2 and to room_3 via red_door_3. Both doors are locked. So, to leave room_4, I need to unlock either red_door_2 or red_door_3. But to unlock a door, I have to be in front of it and toggle it. But to get in front of a door, I need to go there, which might be blocked by an object. Wait, the preconditions for "gotodoor d r1 r2" require that there's no object blocking the position in front of the door in the current room.

In room_4, there's grey_box_1, blue_box_1, and red_ball_1. Are any of these blocking the doors? The problem states that objects can block doors if they are in front of them. So, if any of these objects are in front of the doors leading out of room_4, then I can't go to the door until I move them. But the initial positions of the objects aren't specified beyond their rooms. Assuming that they are not blocking the doors unless stated. The problem doesn't mention any blocked doors initially, so maybe the doors are accessible.

So, first step: go to red_door_2 (connecting room_4 and room_2) or red_door_3 (connecting room_4 and room_3). Let's pick one. Let's say I choose red_door_2 first. So, I can do "gotodoor red_door_2 room_4 room_2". Then, toggle it to unlock. Then, go through to room_2. Once in room_2, there's yellow_box_2. But wait, the yellow boxes in room_2 are yellow_box_2 and red_box_1 (no, red_box_1 is red). Wait, the initial state says red_box_1 is in room_2 and is red. Yellow_box_2 is in room_2 and is yellow. So in room_2, yellow_box_2 is present. So if I can get to room_2, I can go to that box and be in front of it.

But let's outline the steps:

1. From room_4, go to red_door_2 (since it connects room_4 and room_2). Preconditions: I'm in a room that the door connects (room_4) and no object is blocking the door. Assuming no blocking, so I can do "gotodoor red_door_2 room_4 room_2".

2. Then, toggle red_door_2 to unlock it. Since it's locked, toggling will unlock it.

3. Then, use "gotoroom room_4 room_2 red_door_2" to move to room_2.

4. Once in room_2, go to yellow_box_2 using "gotoobject yellow_box_2 room_2".

Then, the goal is achieved because I'm in front of a yellow box (yellow_box_2). So that's the plan?

Wait, but the initial state says all doors are locked. So red_door_2 is locked. To unlock it, I need to toggle it, but I can only toggle if I'm in front of it. So steps:

1. In room_4, go to red_door_2 (gotodoor red_door_2 room_4 room_2). Precondition: in room_4, which I am. And no object is blocking. Assuming no blocking.

2. Toggle red_door_2 (unlocks it).

3. Then, go through the door to room_2 (gotoroom room_4 room_2 red_door_2).

4. Now in room_2, go to yellow_box_2 (gotoobject yellow_box_2 room_2).

That's four actions. But wait, when you go through the door, you are no longer in front of the door. So after step 3, you are in room_2, not in front of any object. Then step 4 is to go to the yellow box. So that seems correct.

But let's check the preconditions again. When going to the door (step 1), the room must be connected via the door, which it is (room_4 and room_2 via red_door_2). No blocking objects, which I assume is the case. Then toggle (step 2) requires being in front of the door, which we are after step 1. Then, gotoroom (step3) requires that the door is unlocked (which it is after toggle). Then, step4: in room_2, need to go to the object in the same room. So that's okay.

Alternatively, maybe the doors are blocked by objects in room_4. For example, if the grey_box_1 is in front of red_door_2, then I can't go to the door until I move it. But the problem doesn't specify object positions beyond their rooms. The problem states that the initial state includes "grey_box_1 is in room_4", but not where. So unless the problem states that an object is blocking a door, we can assume it's not. Therefore, the initial plan should work.

Another possible path: using red_door_3 to room_3. But in room_3, there's yellow_box_3. So steps would be:

1. gotodoor red_door_3 room_4 room_3

2. toggle red_door_3

3. gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_3

4. gotoobject yellow_box_3 room_3

That's also four steps. But the problem requires the optimal (shortest) plan. Both paths are four steps. So either is acceptable. But perhaps the original plan via room_2 is better.

Wait, but the initial state says that in room_4, the blue_door_1 is locked. Wait, blue_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3. So that's not directly accessible from room_4. So the only doors from room_4 are red_door_2 (to room_2) and red_door_3 (to room_3). Both are locked. So whichever door I choose, I have to unlock it first.

So the plan via red_door_2 to room_2, then yellow_box_2 is in room_2, which is yellow. So that's valid.

Another consideration: after moving to room_2, do I need to do anything else? The goal is just to have a yellow box in front of me. So once I'm in front of yellow_box_2, the goal is achieved. So the plan would be four steps.

But wait, after step 3 (gotoroom), I'm in room_2, but not in front of any object. Then step4 is gotoobject yellow_box_2 room_2. So that's correct.

Alternatively, maybe there's a shorter path. But given that all doors start locked, I need to unlock at least one door to get out of room_4. So the minimal steps would be four. Let me check again.

Start in room_4. To get to a yellow box, which is in rooms 1,2,3. So I have to leave room_4, which requires unlocking a door. The steps are: gotodoor, toggle, gotoroom, gotoobject. Four steps. That seems minimal.

But maybe there's a way to have fewer steps. Let's think: for example, if I can unlock a door without moving. But no, to unlock a door, I have to be in front of it. So I have to first go to the door (gotodoor), then toggle it. Then go through (gotoroom), then go to the object. So four steps. There's no way to do it in fewer steps. So the plan is four actions.

So the answer should be:

```
gotodoor red_door_2 room_4 room_2
toggle red_door_2
gotoroom room_4 room_2 red_door_2
gotoobject yellow_box_2 room_2
```

Alternatively, using red_door_3 to room_3 and then yellow_box_3. Either way, same number of steps. The problem doesn't specify which yellow box, so either is acceptable. Let's pick one. The answer uses red_door_2 and room_2's yellow_box_2.

Another check: constraints. The constraints weren't mentioned, but the problem says to satisfy all constraints. The user mentioned the constraints in the problem statement but didn't list them here. Wait, looking back, the user provided the problem's constraints after the initial state. Wait, the user wrote:

"A valid plan for the abovementioned problem must abide by the following constraints:"

But in the provided input, the user didn't list the constraints. Wait, looking back at the user message, after the initial state and the goal, the user wrote:

"A valid plan for the abovementioned problem must abide by the following constraints:"

But then there's nothing. Maybe a formatting error. But assuming that the constraints are not present, or perhaps the user intended to include them but they're missing. Since the user might have made a mistake, but in the problem as presented, there are no additional constraints beyond the preconditions of the actions. So the plan I outlined is valid.

Therefore, the correct plan is the four steps as above.
