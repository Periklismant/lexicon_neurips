Let's break down the problem:

Initial State:
- I am in room_4
- yellow_box_1 is in room_1
- yellow_box_2 is in room_2
- yellow_box_3 is in room_3
- grey_box_1 is in room_4
- blue_box_1 is in room_4
- red_ball_1 is in room_4
- grey_ball_1 is in room_1
- red_box_1 is in room_2
- I am not holding any object
- All doors are locked

Goal:
- I need to be standing in front of a yellow box

Since I'm starting in room_4 and there are no yellow boxes in room_4, I need to go to one of the other rooms where yellow boxes are located. 

Let's think about how to unlock doors and navigate to a room with a yellow box:

1. From room_4, I can go to room_2 via red_door_2 or to room_3 via red_door_3.
2. From room_2, I can go to room_1 via red_door_1.
3. From room_3, I can go to room_1 via blue_door_1.
4. yellow_box_1 is in room_1, yellow_box_2 is in room_2, and yellow_box_3 is in room_3.

So, I have multiple paths to find a yellow box.

Optimal Plan:
1. I am in room_4 and need to stand in front of a yellow box.

Option 1: Go to room_2 (where yellow_box_2 is):
- Go to the red_door_2 that connects room_4 and room_2.
- Unlock red_door_2.
- Go to room_2 from room_4 using red_door_2.
- Go to yellow_box_2 in room_2.

Option 2: Go to room_3 (where yellow_box_3 is):
- Go to the red_door_3 that connects room_4 and room_3.
- Unlock red_door_3.
- Go to room_3 from room_4 using red_door_3.
- Go to yellow_box_3 in room_3.

Option 3: Go to room_1 (where yellow_box_1 is):
- This would involve passing through at least two doors, which is longer than the other options.

Given that I want an optimal plan, I'll take either Option 1 or Option 2. They both involve the same number of steps, so either is valid. Let's go with Option 1 to reach yellow_box_2 in room_2:

1. gotodoor red_door_2 room_4 room_2 (Go to the door connecting room_4 and room_2)
2. toggle red_door_2 (Unlock the door)
3. gotoroom room_4 room_2 red_door_2 (Go to room_2)
4. gotoobject yellow_box_2 room_2 (Go to yellow_box_2 in room_2)

This should be a valid and optimal plan to achieve the goal. Let's check if there are any preconditions I might have missed:

- For "gotodoor", I need to be in room_4, which I am. I also need to ensure there's no object blocking the door in room_4. Since the problem description doesn't mention any objects blocking doors, I assume this precondition is met.
- For "toggle", I need to be in front of the door, which I will be after the "gotodoor" action.
- For "gotoroom", I need to be in front of the door and the door should be unlocked, which will be the case after the "toggle" action.
- For "gotoobject", I need to be in the same room as the object, which I will be after the "gotoroom" action.

The plan seems to satisfy all the required preconditions.

Actually, I'm a bit concerned because the initial state doesn't specify whether any objects are blocking doors. Let's assume no objects are blocking doors initially, as this isn't specified in the problem. Given that assumption, my plan should work.

Actually, let me verify the optimality of the plan. The goal is to be standing in front of a yellow box, and the options are:

1. yellow_box_1 in room_1 (would require going through room_2 or room_3)
2. yellow_box_2 in room_2 (would require going through red_door_2)
3. yellow_box_3 in room_3 (would require going through red_door_3)

Given that I'm starting in room_4, options 2 and 3 would require going through one door, which is fewer steps than option 1 (which requires going through two doors). So going to either room_2 or room_3 would be optimal.

Let's go with the plan to reach yellow_box_2 in room_2, but the analogous plan for yellow_box_3 in room_3 would also be optimal.

Let me rewrite the plan with the exact action syntax:

1. gotodoor red_door_2 room_4 room_2
2. toggle red_door_2
3. gotoroom room_4 room_2 red_door_2
4. gotoobject yellow_box_2 room_2

This is a correct, optimal plan.

Hmm wait actually, Let me also solve this with getting to yellow_box_3 in room_3 and see which one is more optimal:

1. gotodoor red_door_3 room_4 room_3
2. toggle red_door_3
3. gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_3
4. gotoobject yellow_box_3 room_3

And one more time for getting to the yellow box in room_1, to be thorough:

1. gotodoor red_door_2 room_4 room_2
2. toggle red_door_2
3. gotoroom room_4 room_2 red_door_2
4. gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_1
5. toggle red_door_1
6. gotoroom room_2 room_1 red_door_1
7. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_1

The shortest path is either to room_2 or room_3, both of which have a yellow box, so either solution is optimal. I'll stick with the plan to get to yellow_box_2 in room_2, which is 4 steps:

1. gotodoor red_door_2 room_4 room_2
2. toggle red_door_2
3. gotoroom room_4 room_2 red_door_2
4. gotoobject yellow_box_2 room_2
