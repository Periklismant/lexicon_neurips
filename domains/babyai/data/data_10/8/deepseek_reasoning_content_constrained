Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. Hmm, the goal is to have a green box that I'm in front of. The initial state is in room_1, and there are a lot of constraints to satisfy. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the final goal: I need to be in front of a green box. Looking at the objects, the green boxes are green_box_1 and green_box_2, both in room_3. So I need to get to one of those. But how do I get to room_3 from room_1? The red_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3. However, all doors are initially locked, including red_door_1. But there's a constraint that red_door_1 must always be locked. So I can't unlock it. Wait, that's a problem. Because to get to room_3, I need to go through red_door_1, but if it's locked and I can't toggle it (since the constraint says it must stay locked), then how can I get there? Wait, no. The constraint says that "red_door_1 is locked" must hold in every state. So I can never unlock it. That means I can't use red_door_1 to go to room_3. Hmm, that's a major issue. So how else can I get to room_3?

Let me see the door connections. The doors are blue_door_1 connects room_1 and room_2. Red_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3. Yellow_door_1 connects room_2 and room_4. Green_door_1 connects room_3 and room_4. Since red_door_1 is always locked, I can't go from room_1 to room_3 directly. So I need an alternative path. Let's see: Maybe go from room_1 to room_2 via blue_door_1. Then from room_2 to room_4 via yellow_door_1. Then from room_4 to room_3 via green_door_1. But green_door_1 is initially locked. So I need to unlock it. But how?

So, the path would be: room_1 -> room_2 (blue_door_1, but it's locked). Wait, all doors are locked initially. So first, I need to unlock some doors. Let's check the constraints again. The constraints require that yellow_door_1 must be unlocked in at least one state. Also, blue_door_1 must be unlocked in a state where I'm holding green_box_2. And green_door_1 must be unlocked at or after any state where I'm in room_1.

Wait, the constraint says: If I'm in room_1 in some state s, then green_door_1 must be unlocked at s or after. So when I'm in room_1 initially, I need to ensure that green_door_1 is unlocked at some point after that. But green_door_1 is in room_3 and room_4. So maybe I have to unlock it later.

But first, let's consider how to unlock doors. To toggle a door, I need to be in front of it. So I need to go to the door and toggle it. But doors are in between rooms. For example, blue_door_1 connects room_1 and room_2. So to toggle blue_door_1, I can be in room_1 or room_2, go in front of it, then toggle.

But initially, all doors are locked. So let's think about which doors need to be unlocked to get around. The required constraints include that yellow_door_1 must be unlocked in some state. Also, the plan must include being in room_3 and room_4, and room_1 again, with certain conditions.

Starting in room_1. Let's see:

1. First, unlock blue_door_1. Because blue_door_1 is connecting room_1 and room_2. So I can go to blue_door_1 from room_1. But blue_door_1 is locked. Wait, to go to a door, the preconditions say I can go in front of a door d if I'm in a room connected by d, and there's no object blocking the position in front of d. Are there any objects blocking doors? The initial state doesn't mention any objects blocking doors. So maybe I can go to blue_door_1 in room_1.

So steps:

- gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2 (since I'm in room_1, and blue_door_1 connects room_1 and room_2)
- toggle blue_door_1 (this unlocks it)
Then, go to room_2 via gotoroom room_1 room_2 blue_door_1.

But wait, after unlocking blue_door_1, I can use it to move to room_2.

Once in room_2, there's red_box_1 and grey_box_1. But the goal is to get to a green box in room_3. So from room_2, I can go to room_4 via yellow_door_1. But yellow_door_1 is locked. So need to unlock that. But one of the constraints is that yellow_door_1 must be unlocked at least once. So perhaps we can unlock it here.

So in room_2, go to yellow_door_1 (gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_4), then toggle it (unlock). Then go to room_4.

In room_4, there's yellow_box_1 and grey_ball_1. Then from room_4, go to room_3 via green_door_1. But green_door_1 is locked. Need to unlock it. But green_door_1 connects room_3 and room_4. So to toggle it, I need to be in room_4 or room_3. Since I'm in room_4, I can go to green_door_1 in room_4, toggle it (unlock), then go to room_3.

Once in room_3, there are green_box_1 and green_box_2. So the goal is to be in front of one of these. So gotoobject green_box_1 room_3. Then drop or pick? No, the goal is just to be in front of a green box. So perhaps after arriving in room_3, I can go to one of the boxes. But also, the constraints require that I must have been in front of empty or holding something before entering room_3. So let's check that.

The third constraint says if I'm in room_3 in some state, there must be an earlier state where I was in front of empty or holding something. So before entering room_3, I need to have either been in front of empty or holding an object. For example, if I pick up an object in room_4 before going to room_3, that would satisfy holding something. Alternatively, I can gotoempty in room_4 before moving to room_3.

But let's think. When moving to room_3 from room_4 via green_door_1, I need to first unlock green_door_1. So steps in room_4:

- gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3
- toggle green_door_1 (unlock)
- gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1

But before going to room_3, maybe I need to satisfy the condition for entering room_3. So before entering room_3, I have to have either been in front of empty or holding an object. Let's see. Suppose I'm in room_4. Maybe I pick up grey_ball_1 in room_4. So:

In room_4:

- gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_4
- pick grey_ball_1 room_4

Then, when I go to room_3, I'm holding an object. So when I enter room_3, the state where I'm in room_3 would have had an earlier state (when I picked up the ball) where I was holding something. That satisfies the constraint.

Alternatively, if I gotoempty in room_4 before moving, that would also work. But picking up the ball might be necessary for other constraints. Wait, the constraints also require that in some state, either grey_ball_1 is in room_1 or I'm in front of yellow_door_1. So if I pick up grey_ball_1 in room_4 and then carry it to room_3, then maybe later drop it somewhere else. But perhaps that's complicating things. Let's see.

Another constraint is that in some state, I must be in front of red_door_1. Since red_door_1 is in room_1 and room_3, but I can't go through it because it's locked. So I need to go in front of red_door_1 while in room_1. But how? Because after leaving room_1, can I come back?

Wait, the constraint says that if I'm in room_1 in some state s, then green_door_1 must be unlocked at s or after. So after returning to room_1, I need to ensure that green_door_1 is unlocked. But green_door_1 is between room_3 and room_4. So maybe after unlocking green_door_1, I can go back to room_1 via some path. But that seems complicated. Let's think step by step.

Let me outline a possible path:

1. Start in room_1.

Constraints:
- Must be in room_1 at some state. Check.
- Must be in front of red_door_1 at some state. So perhaps after doing some actions in room_1.

But in room_1, the doors are blue_door_1 (connects to room_2) and red_door_1 (connects to room_3). But red_door_1 is locked and must remain locked. So I can't go through it, but I can go in front of it. So maybe:

In room_1:

- gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3 (but red_door_1 is in room_1, connected to room_3)
- Then, the constraint to be in front of red_door_1 is satisfied here. But then, the other part: if in front of red_door_1 in state s, then in s or after, blue_door_1 is unlocked and holding green_box_1. So after being in front of red_door_1, I need to have blue_door_1 unlocked and hold green_box_1 at some point.

But blue_door_1 is the door between room_1 and room_2. So perhaps unlock blue_door_1 first, then go to room_2, get green_box_1 from room_3? Wait, green_box_1 is in room_3. Hmm.

This is getting complicated. Let's try to outline a possible sequence:

1. Start in room_1.

Need to be in front of red_door_1. So:

Action: gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3

Now, in front of red_door_1. This satisfies the constraint of being in front of it. But then, according to the constraint, after this, in some state, blue_door_1 must be unlocked and I must be holding green_box_1. So after this, I need to unlock blue_door_1 and get green_box_1.

But how to unlock blue_door_1: since it's in room_1 and room_2. From room_1, can I go to blue_door_1 and toggle it.

But after being in front of red_door_1, I can go to blue_door_1:

Action: gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2

Then toggle blue_door_1 (unlocking it). Now, blue_door_1 is unlocked.

Then, go to room_2 via blue_door_1.

In room_2, there are red_box_1 and grey_box_1. But I need to get green_box_1 from room_3. To get to room_3, I need to go through room_4 and green_door_1. Let's proceed.

From room_2, need to go to room_4 via yellow_door_1. But yellow_door_1 is locked. So:

In room_2:

- gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_4
- toggle yellow_door_1 (unlocks it)
- gotoroom room_2 room_4 yellow_door_1 (now in room_4)

In room_4, there's yellow_box_1 and grey_ball_1. Need to get to room_3. So unlock green_door_1:

In room_4:

- gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3
- toggle green_door_1 (unlocks it)
- gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1 (now in room_3)

Now, in room_3 with green_box_1 and green_box_2. Need to pick up one of them. But to satisfy the constraint that when entering room_3, there was an earlier state where I was holding something or in front of empty. Let's see: the path to room_3 was from room_4. Before entering room_3, in room_4, did I do something? Let's see:

When in room_4, before going to room_3, I can pick up grey_ball_1. So:

In room_4:

- gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_4
- pick grey_ball_1 room_4

Then, after that, go to room_3. Now, when in room_3, the earlier state (picking up the ball) satisfies the condition of holding something. So that's good.

Now, in room_3, holding grey_ball_1. Need to get green_box_1. But can't pick it up while holding something. So need to drop grey_ball_1 first. Or maybe just go in front of green_box_1 and drop it there? Wait, the goal is to be in front of a green box. So perhaps:

In room_3:

- drop grey_ball_1 room_3 (but need to be in front of a position to drop it)
Wait, drop action requires that I'm holding the object and the position in front is empty. So perhaps:

In room_3:

- gotoempty (to get in front of an empty spot)
- drop grey_ball_1 room_3 (now, I'm in front of grey_ball_1, but the goal is to be in front of a green box)

Alternatively, pick up green_box_1:

But first, need to drop the grey_ball_1. So:

- gotoempty room_3
- drop grey_ball_1 room_3 (now holding nothing)
- gotoobject green_box_1 room_3 (now in front of it, which satisfies the goal)

But wait, the goal is to have a green box that I'm in front of. So being in front of green_box_1 in room_3 would satisfy that. So maybe after dropping the grey_ball_1, just go to green_box_1 and that's it.

But also, there's a constraint that in some state, I must be holding green_box_2 and blue_door_1 is unlocked. Let's check that.

The constraint: "The following expression must hold in at least one state: "The following conditions are all true: "blue_door_1 is not locked", "you are holding green_box_2"".

So at some point, I need to be holding green_box_2 while blue_door_1 is unlocked. But green_box_2 is in room_3. So after getting to room_3, pick up green_box_2, then perhaps return to room_1 via the same path, but blue_door_1 is already unlocked. Let's see.

But how to return to room_1 from room_3. Since red_door_1 is locked, the path would be room_3 -> green_door_1 -> room_4 -> yellow_door_1 -> room_2 -> blue_door_1 -> room_1. But green_door_1 was unlocked earlier, and yellow_door_1 was unlocked, blue_door_1 is unlocked. So possible.

So steps:

In room_3:

- gotoobject green_box_2 room_3
- pick green_box_2 room_3 (now holding it)
- At this point, blue_door_1 is unlocked (from earlier steps), so the state of blue_door_1 being unlocked and holding green_box_2 is satisfied.

Then, need to go back to room_1 to satisfy the constraint that if I'm in room_1, then green_door_1 must be unlocked at or after that. But I'm not in room_1 yet. Wait, the constraint says that if in some state s, you are in room_1, then green_door_1 is not locked in s or after. So when I return to room_1, I need to have green_door_1 unlocked. But green_door_1 was already unlocked when I went from room_4 to room_3. So that's okay.

So after picking up green_box_2 in room_3, I can return to room_1 via:

room_3 -> green_door_1 -> room_4 -> yellow_door_1 -> room_2 -> blue_door_1 -> room_1.

But this requires going through several rooms. Let's outline:

From room_3, go to room_4 via green_door_1 (already unlocked).

In room_4:

- gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_1 (no, wait, to go from room_3 to room_4, use green_door_1. So action would be gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_1.

Then, from room_4 to room_2 via yellow_door_1 (unlocked). Then from room_2 to room_1 via blue_door_1 (unlocked). So:

In room_4:

- gotoroom room_4 room_2 yellow_door_1 (to room_2)

In room_2:

- gotoroom room_2 room_1 blue_door_1 (to room_1)

Now, in room_1. Here, the constraint says that if I'm in room_1, then green_door_1 must be unlocked at or after. Since green_door_1 was unlocked earlier, this is satisfied.

But also, when returning to room_1, I'm holding green_box_2. So the constraint about blue_door_1 being unlocked and holding green_box_2 is already satisfied when I was in room_3 after picking up green_box_2, because blue_door_1 was unlocked earlier.

Wait, no. The constraint requires that in some state, both blue_door_1 is unlocked and I'm holding green_box_2. So if I'm holding green_box_2 in room_3, and blue_door_1 is unlocked (since we toggled it earlier), then that state satisfies the condition. So that's covered.

Now, back to room_1. The final goal is to be in front of a green box. But I'm in room_1, holding green_box_2. To drop it here:

In room_1:

- gotoempty (to find an empty spot)
- drop green_box_2 room_1 (now in front of it)

But then, the goal is achieved. However, the initial boxes in room_3 are green_box_1 and green_box_2, but if I drop green_box_2 in room_1, then there's a green box in room_1, and I can be in front of it. So this would satisfy the goal.

Alternatively, after returning to room_1 with green_box_2, I can drop it there, then gotoobject green_box_2 room_1. That would meet the goal.

But wait, the goal is "There is a box v such that v is green and you are in front of v". So as long as I'm in front of any green box in any room. So if I drop green_box_2 in room_1 and then go in front of it, that's acceptable.

But this requires more steps. Let's see:

After returning to room_1 with green_box_2:

- gotoempty room_1
- drop green_box_2 room_1
- gotoobject green_box_2 room_1

Now, in front of green_box_2 in room_1. This satisfies the goal. But this adds more steps. Alternatively, when in room_3, after picking up green_box_2, just gotoobject green_box_1 (but can't because I'm holding green_box_2). Wait, no, I can't be in front of an object while holding another. Wait, the "gotoobject" action requires that you are in the same room as the object. So in room_3, if I'm holding green_box_2, I can drop it, then goto green_box_1. But the goal is just to be in front of any green box, so if I drop green_box_2 in room_3, then goto it, that would work. But why go through all the trouble of moving it to room_1? Maybe that's unnecessary.

Alternatively, after picking up green_box_2 in room_3, maybe just drop it in room_3, then goto it. But then, when I drop it, I'm in front of it. So the drop action would leave me in front of it, satisfying the goal immediately. Wait, the drop action's effect is (i) you are no longer carrying x, (ii) you are in front of x. So after dropping, you're in front of x. So if I drop green_box_2 in room_3, then I'm in front of it, which satisfies the goal. That's efficient.

So let's adjust the plan:

In room_3:

- gotoobject green_box_2 room_3
- pick green_box_2 room_3 (now holding it)
- At this point, the constraint about holding green_box_2 and blue_door_1 being unlocked is satisfied, since blue_door_1 was unlocked earlier.

Then:

- gotoempty room_3 (to find a spot to drop)
- drop green_box_2 room_3 (now in front of it, goal achieved)

But wait, no. The drop action requires that I'm holding the object and the position in front is empty. So if I'm in front of an empty spot, I can drop it there, which would place the box there and leave me in front of it. So:

After picking up green_box_2, I can:

- gotoempty room_3 (move to an empty spot)
- drop green_box_2 room_3 (now in front of green_box_2, which is green)

This would immediately satisfy the goal. So this seems better, avoiding the need to move back to room_1.

But then, what about the constraint that requires being in room_1 again? The constraint says that the following must hold in at least one state: "you are in room_1". Since we start in room_1, that's already satisfied. Wait, initial state says "you have visited room_1". So the initial state counts as having been in room_1. But the constraint says "The following expression must hold in at least one state: "you are in room_1"". So the initial state counts. So we don't need to return to room_1 again. So the initial state already satisfies that constraint.

Wait, but the initial state is the starting point, so any plan must include being in room_1 at the start. So that's already covered. So we don't need to return to room_1 again. Therefore, the plan can end in room_3 after dropping green_box_2 there.

So this would be more efficient. Let's outline the entire plan step by step:

1. Start in room_1.

2. gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3 (to satisfy being in front of red_door_1)

3. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2 (to prepare to unlock it)

4. toggle blue_door_1 (unlocks it)

5. gotoroom room_1 room_2 blue_door_1 (now in room_2)

6. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_4 (prepare to unlock)

7. toggle yellow_door_1 (unlocks it; satisfies the constraint that yellow_door_1 is unlocked in some state)

8. gotoroom room_2 room_4 yellow_door_1 (now in room_4)

9. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_4 (to pick it up)

10. pick grey_ball_1 room_4 (now holding it; this ensures that when entering room_3, there's an earlier state where holding something)

11. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3 (prepare to unlock)

12. toggle green_door_1 (unlocks it)

13. gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1 (now in room_3; the constraint for being in room_3 is satisfied, and the earlier state of holding grey_ball_1 meets the condition)

14. gotoempty room_3 (to have an empty spot to drop green_box_2)

15. drop grey_ball_1 room_3 (now not holding anything; but we need to pick up green_box_2)

Wait, but in step 10, we picked grey_ball_1, then in step 15, we drop it. Then we need to pick up green_box_2. But maybe instead, after picking up grey_ball_1, we go to room_3, drop it there, then pick up green_box_2.

But let's think again. The goal is to have a green box in front of me. So after step 13, I'm in room_3, holding grey_ball_1. To satisfy the goal, I need to drop that, then pick up a green box and drop it in front of me. Or just drop the grey_ball_1 and then goto a green box.

Alternatively, after dropping grey_ball_1, I can pick up green_box_2 and drop it in front of me.

But let's proceed:

14. gotoempty room_3 (to find a spot to drop grey_ball_1)

15. drop grey_ball_1 room_3 (now in front of it, but it's a ball, not a box)

16. gotoobject green_box_2 room_3 (now in front of it)

But after dropping grey_ball_1, I'm in front of it. So step 15 leaves me in front of grey_ball_1. Then I need to go to green_box_2. But step 16 would require moving to green_box_2.

Alternatively, after step 13 (in room_3), I can:

14. drop grey_ball_1 room_3 (but need to be in front of an empty spot. So first, gotoempty)

14. gotoempty room_3

15. drop grey_ball_1 room_3 (now in front of empty spot, but the grey_ball_1 is now in room_3)

16. gotoobject green_box_2 room_3 (now in front of it)

17. pick green_box_2 room_3 (now holding it; this allows us to satisfy the constraint of holding green_box_2 while blue_door_1 is unlocked)

18. gotoempty room_3 (to drop it)

19. drop green_box_2 room_3 (now in front of it, satisfying the goal)

But this adds more steps. Alternatively, after step 13, I can:

14. drop grey_ball_1 room_3 (but need to be in front of empty first)

Wait, the drop action requires that the position in front is empty. So after entering room_3, I'm not in front of any object (since the effect of gotoroom is that you're no longer in front of anything). So I can just drop the grey_ball_1 immediately:

14. drop grey_ball_1 room_3 (but since I'm not in front of any object, maybe I can drop it in the current position?)

Wait, no. The drop action's precondition is that the position in front of you is empty. So after entering room_3, the agent is not in front of any object. So where is the agent? The gotoroom action's effect is that you are no longer in front of any object. So the agent is in room_3, not in front of any object. So to drop the grey_ball_1, the agent needs to be in front of an empty position. So:

14. gotoempty room_3

15. drop grey_ball_1 room_3 (now in front of it)

16. gotoobject green_box_2 room_3 (now in front of it; this satisfies the goal)

But steps 14-16 are necessary. Alternatively, after dropping grey_ball_1, I can just stay in front of it, but it's a ball, not a box. So I need to go to a green box.

Alternatively, after dropping the grey_ball_1 in room_3, I can pick up green_box_2 and then drop it again in front of me. But that's redundant. Alternatively, after step 13, holding grey_ball_1, I can gotoobject green_box_2 room_3. But can I do that while holding an object? The gotoobject action doesn't require holding nothing. The precondition for gotoobject is that you're in the same room as x. So yes. So:

14. gotoobject green_box_2 room_3 (now in front of it, holding grey_ball_1)

15. drop grey_ball_1 room_3 (now in front of green_box_2, but need to have an empty spot. Wait, no. The drop action requires that the position in front is empty. If I'm in front of green_box_2, then the position in front is occupied by green_box_2. So I can't drop there. So I need to gotoempty first.

So correct steps:

14. gotoempty room_3

15. drop grey_ball_1 room_3 (now in front of empty, but after dropping, I'm in front of grey_ball_1)

16. gotoobject green_box_2 room_3 (now in front of it, which is green. Goal achieved)

But step 16 achieves the goal. So the plan would end here.

But we need to ensure all constraints are met. Let's check:

Constraints:

1. red_door_1 is locked in every state. Yes, never toggled.

2. At least one state in room_3. Step 13.

3. When in room_3 (step 13), there's an earlier state (step 10) where holding grey_ball_1. Yes.

4. At least one state in room_4. Steps 8-12.

5. At least one state where yellow_door_1 is unlocked. Step 7.

6. At least one state in room_1. Initial state.

7. If in room_1, then green_door_1 unlocked at or after. Since in initial state (room_1), green_door_1 is locked, but in step 12, we unlocked it. So after the initial state, green_door_1 is unlocked. So the constraint is satisfied.

8. At least one state where blue_door_1 is unlocked and holding green_box_2. After step 13, we are in room_3, holding grey_ball_1. But when we pick green_box_2 in step 17, blue_door_1 is already unlocked. So when holding green_box_2 in step 17, blue_door_1 is unlocked. That satisfies the constraint.

9. At least one state where grey_ball_1 is in room_1 or in front of yellow_door_1. grey_ball_1 is moved to room_3 in step 15. But in step 9, we were in front of yellow_door_1 (step 6: gotodoor yellow_door_1 in room_2, which is in front of it). So step 6 is gotodoor yellow_door_1, which puts us in front of it. So step 6 satisfies the condition of being in front of yellow_door_1. So that's covered.

10. At least one state in front of red_door_1. Step 2.

11. If in front of red_door_1 (step 2), then in some state after, blue_door_1 is unlocked and holding green_box_1. Wait, the constraint says: if in front of red_door_1 in state s, then in s or after, blue_door_1 is not locked and holding green_box_1. But in our plan, after step 2, we unlock blue_door_1 (step 4), but we are holding green_box_2, not green_box_1. So this constraint is not satisfied. Oh, this is a problem.

So the constraint requires that after being in front of red_door_1, we must have a state where blue_door_1 is unlocked and we're holding green_box_1. But in the current plan, we hold green_box_2. So this is an issue.

Ah, this is a mistake. The constraint says:

"If expression 
"you are in front of red_door_1"
holds in some state s, then expression
"The following conditions are all true: "blue_door_1 is not locked", "you are holding green_box_1""
must hold at s or at some state after s"

So after being in front of red_door_1 (step 2), we need to have a state where blue_door_1 is unlocked and we're holding green_box_1. In the current plan, blue_door_1 is unlocked (step 4), but we never pick up green_box_1. We picked green_box_2. So this constraint is not satisfied. Therefore, the plan is invalid.

So we need to adjust the plan to include picking up green_box_1 instead of green_box_2. Let's see.

So after reaching room_3 (step 13), instead of picking green_box_2, we need to pick green_box_1.

But how to satisfy the other constraint about holding green_box_2 and blue_door_1 being unlocked. Wait, that's a separate constraint. The constraint says:

"The following expression must hold in at least one state: "The following conditions are all true: "blue_door_1 is not locked", "you are holding green_box_2"""

So we need to satisfy both:

1. After being in front of red_door_1 (step 2), we need to have blue_door_1 unlocked and holding green_box_1.

2. At least once, have blue_door_1 unlocked and holding green_box_2.

So the plan must include both.

This complicates things. Let's adjust the plan to pick both boxes.

But that's going to increase the steps. Let's think:

After step 13 (in room_3):

14. gotoobject green_box_1 room_3

15. pick green_box_1 room_3 (now holding it)

This satisfies the constraint related to red_door_1, since after step 2, we have step 4 (blue_door_1 unlocked) and step 15 (holding green_box_1).

Then, we need to also pick green_box_2 to satisfy the other constraint.

So after step 15:

16. drop green_box_1 room_3 (need to be in front of empty)

17. gotoobject green_box_2 room_3

18. pick green_box_2 room_3 (now holding it, blue_door_1 is unlocked)

This satisfies the other constraint.

Then, drop green_box_2 in room_3 and goto it.

But this adds more steps. Let's outline the revised plan:

1. Start in room_1.

2. gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3 (in front of red_door_1)

3. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2

4. toggle blue_door_1 (unlocks it)

5. gotoroom room_1 room_2 blue_door_1 (now in room_2)

6. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_4

7. toggle yellow_door_1 (unlocks it)

8. gotoroom room_2 room_4 yellow_door_1 (now in room_4)

9. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_4

10. pick grey_ball_1 room_4

11. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3

12. toggle green_door_1 (unlocks it)

13. gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1 (now in room_3)

14. gotoempty room_3

15. drop grey_ball_1 room_3 (now in front of it)

16. gotoobject green_box_1 room_3

17. pick green_box_1 room_3 (now holding it; this satisfies the constraint after step 2)

18. gotoempty room_3

19. drop green_box_1 room_3

20. gotoobject green_box_2 room_3

21. pick green_box_2 room_3 (now holding it; satisfies the other constraint)

22. gotoempty room_3

23. drop green_box_2 room_3 (now in front of it, goal achieved)

This way, both constraints are satisfied. But this adds many steps, which may not be optimal. However, the problem requires an optimal plan with minimal steps. So perhaps there's a way to optimize this.

Alternative approach: After picking green_box_1, instead of dropping it, carry it through the journey to also satisfy the other constraint.

Wait, the other constraint requires holding green_box_2 while blue_door_1 is unlocked. So if I pick green_box_2 after picking green_box_1, but that's impossible since I can only carry one object at a time. So need to pick them sequentially.

Alternatively, after picking green_box_1, carry it back to room_1, drop it, then go back to room_3 to pick green_box_2, but that's even more steps.

Alternatively, after step 17 (holding green_box_1), go back to room_1 to satisfy the constraint. Let's see:

17. pick green_box_1 room_3

Then, return to room_1:

18. gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_1 (room_4)

19. gotoroom room_4 room_2 yellow_door_1 (room_2)

20. gotoroom room_2 room_1 blue_door_1 (room_1)

21. drop green_box_1 room_1

22. gotoobject green_box_1 room_1 (now in front of it, but it's in room_1)

But the goal is to be in front of a green box. If we drop green_box_1 in room_1, then goto it, that satisfies the goal. But then, we also need to pick green_box_2 to satisfy the other constraint.

This seems too lengthy. Maybe there's a smarter way.

Wait, perhaps after step 17 (holding green_box_1), we can proceed to room_4, then room_2, then room_1. While holding green_box_1, when in room_1, drop it and be in front of it. Then go back to room_3 to pick green_box_2.

But this would make the plan very long, which is not optimal.

Alternatively, perhaps the constraint about holding green_box_2 and blue_door_1 can be satisfied in room_3, after unlocking blue_door_1 and then picking green_box_2. But blue_door_1 is in room_1 and room_2. So being in room_3, blue_door_1's state is unlocked, but I'm in room_3. So if I'm holding green_box_2 in room_3 and blue_door_1 is unlocked, does that satisfy the constraint? Yes, because the constraint doesn't require being in a specific room, just that blue_door_1 is unlocked and holding green_box_2.

So after step 21 (holding green_box_2 in room_3), that state satisfies the constraint, because blue_door_1 is unlocked. So that works. But then, the constraint related to red_door_1 is satisfied when holding green_box_1.

So the revised plan is:

1. gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3

2. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2

3. toggle blue_door_1

4. gotoroom room_1 room_2 blue_door_1

5. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_4

6. toggle yellow_door_1

7. gotoroom room_2 room_4 yellow_door_1

8. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_4

9. pick grey_ball_1 room_4

10. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3

11. toggle green_door_1

12. gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1

13. gotoempty room_3

14. drop grey_ball_1 room_3

15. gotoobject green_box_1 room_3

16. pick green_box_1 room_3

17. gotoempty room_3

18. drop green_box_1 room_3

19. gotoobject green_box_2 room_3

20. pick green_box_2 room_3

21. gotoempty room_3

22. drop green_box_2 room_3

This plan includes both picking green_box_1 and green_box_2, but this is time-consuming. However, the problem requires an optimal plan with minimal steps.

Wait, maybe there's a way to combine these. For example, after picking green_box_1, instead of dropping it, use it to satisfy the constraint, then pick green_box_2.

But how? Let's see:

After step 16 (holding green_box_1), we can:

17. gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_1 (room_4)

18. gotoroom room_4 room_2 yellow_door_1 (room_2)

19. gotoroom room_2 room_1 blue_door_1 (room_1)

20. drop green_box_1 room_1

21. gotoobject green_box_1 room_1 (goal achieved)

But this also requires many steps, and we still need to pick green_box_2 to satisfy the other constraint.

Alternatively, after step 16 (holding green_box_1), we can proceed to room_2, then room_4, then room_3 again, but this is not efficient.

Alternatively, can we pick green_box_1 and then green_box_2 without dropping? No, since we can only hold one object at a time.

This is getting too complicated. Perhaps the optimal plan is to pick green_box_1 to satisfy the red_door_1 constraint, then drop it and pick green_box_2 to satisfy the other constraint, then drop it and be in front of it.

But this leads to 22 steps as above, which may not be optimal.

Wait, perhaps there's a way to satisfy both constraints with fewer steps.

The constraint related to red_door_1 requires that after being in front of it, at some point we hold green_box_1 and blue_door_1 is unlocked. So if we pick green_box_1 and have blue_door_1 unlocked, that's satisfied.

The other constraint requires holding green_box_2 with blue_door_1 unlocked. So if we pick green_box_2 after that, it's okay.

So in the same plan:

After step 16 (holding green_box_1), we can drop it, then pick green_box_2.

But how to do this efficiently.

Let me try to outline a plan with minimal steps:

1. gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3 (front of red_door_1)

2. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2

3. toggle blue_door_1 (unlock)

4. gotoroom room_1 room_2 blue_door_1 (room_2)

5. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_4

6. toggle yellow_door_1 (unlock)

7. gotoroom room_2 room_4 yellow_door_1 (room_4)

8. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_4

9. pick grey_ball_1 room_4

10. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3

11. toggle green_door_1 (unlock)

12. gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1 (room_3)

13. gotoempty room_3

14. drop grey_ball_1 room_3 (now in front of it)

15. gotoobject green_box_1 room_3

16. pick green_box_1 room_3 (now holding green_box_1, blue_door_1 is unlocked. This satisfies the red_door_1 constraint)

17. gotoempty room_3

18. drop green_box_1 room_3 (in front of it)

19. gotoobject green_box_2 room_3

20. pick green_box_2 room_3 (now holding green_box_2, blue_door_1 is unlocked. This satisfies the other constraint)

21. gotoempty room_3

22. drop green_box_2 room_3 (now in front of it, goal achieved)

This plan has 22 steps, but perhaps it's the minimal possible given the constraints.

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to avoid dropping grey_ball_1 and green_box_1, but I can't see it.

Alternatively, after step 16 (holding green_box_1), we can gotoempty and drop it, then pick green_box_2.

But this would require steps 17-20. So the plan length is 22 steps.

But maybe there's a shorter way. Let me think again.

Wait, after step 16 (holding green_box_1), if I drop it in room_3, then pick green_box_2, the plan would be:

16. pick green_box_1 room_3

17. gotoempty room_3

18. drop green_box_1 room_3

19. gotoobject green_box_2 room_3

20. pick green_box_2 room_3

21. gotoempty room_3

22. drop green_box_2 room_3

But steps 17-22 are necessary. So that's six steps after entering room_3.

Alternatively, can we pick green_box_2 first, then green_box_1?

But then the constraint for red_door_1 requires holding green_box_1. So no.

Hmm.

Alternatively, after step 12 (in room_3), we can pick green_box_2 first, then drop it, then pick green_box_1, drop it, then pick green_box_2 again. But this seems longer.

No, that's worse.

Alternatively, maybe combining some steps.

But I think the initial plan with 22 steps is necessary to meet all constraints.

However, perhaps there's a way to optimize.

Wait, after step 12 (in room_3), holding grey_ball_1, can we directly go to green_box_1, drop grey_ball_1 there, then pick green_box_1?

But how:

13. gotoobject green_box_1 room_3 (while holding grey_ball_1)

14. drop grey_ball_1 room_3 (requires front to be empty. So no.)

Alternatively:

13. gotoempty room_3

14. drop grey_ball_1 room_3

15. gotoobject green_box_1 room_3

16. pick green_box_1 room_3 (satisfies red_door_1 constraint)

17. gotoempty room_3

18. drop green_box_1 room_3

19. gotoobject green_box_2 room_3

20. pick green_box_2 room_3 (satisfies other constraint)

21. drop green_box_2 room_3 (in front of it)

This reduces steps by one (from 22 to 21).

But let's count:

1. gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3

2. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2

3. toggle blue_door_1

4. gotoroom room_1 room_2 blue_door_1

5. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_4

6. toggle yellow_door_1

7. gotoroom room_2 room_4 yellow_door_1

8. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_4

9. pick grey_ball_1 room_4

10. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3

11. toggle green_door_1

12. gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1

13. gotoempty room_3

14. drop grey_ball_1 room_3

15. gotoobject green_box_1 room_3

16. pick green_box_1 room_3

17. gotoempty room_3

18. drop green_box_1 room_3

19. gotoobject green_box_2 room_3

20. pick green_box_2 room_3

21. gotoempty room_3

22. drop green_box_2 room_3

Still 22 steps. Hmm.

Alternatively, after step 14 (drop grey_ball_1), can I go directly to green_box_2 and pick it up? But then the red_door_1 constraint isn't met. So no.

This seems like the minimal plan given the constraints. Therefore, this is the best I can do.
