Alright, I need to solve this planning problem. I'll first understand the goal and the constraints, and then I'll develop a plan.

The goal is:
"There is a box v such that "The following conditions are all true: "v is green", "you are in front of v"""

So I need to be in front of a green box. There are two green boxes: green_box_1 and green_box_2, both in room_3.

Next, let's analyze the constraints:

1. "red_door_1 is locked" - This means I can't unlock the red door at any point in my plan.
2. "you are in room_3" - I need to visit room_3 at some point.
3. "If 'you are in room_3' holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which 'At least one of the following conditions is true: "you are in front of empty", "you are holding some object"'" - Before I go to room_3, I must either be in front of an empty position or holding an object.
4. "you are in room_4" - I need to visit room_4 at some point.
5. "yellow_door_1 is not locked" - I need to unlock the yellow door at some point.
6. "you are in room_1" - I'm already in room_1 at the start, so this is satisfied.
7. "If 'you are in room_1' holds in some state s, then 'green_door_1 is not locked' must hold at s or at some state after s" - Since I'm in room_1 at the start, I must unlock the green door at some point.
8. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'The following conditions are all true: "blue_door_1 is not locked", "you are holding green_box_2"'" - I need to unlock the blue door and hold green_box_2 at the same time at some point.
9. "At least one of the following conditions is true: 'grey_ball_1 is in room_1', 'you are in front of yellow_door_1'" - I need to either move grey_ball_1 to room_1 or stand in front of yellow_door_1 at some point.
10. "you are in front of red_door_1" - I need to stand in front of red_door_1 at some point.
11. "If 'you are in front of red_door_1' holds in some state s, then 'The following conditions are all true: "blue_door_1 is not locked", "you are holding green_box_1"' must hold at s or at some state after s" - After standing in front of red_door_1, I need to unlock the blue door and hold green_box_1 at some point.

Now, let's assess the initial state and think about a plan:

I start in room_1. There are two doors in room_1: blue_door_1 (to room_2) and red_door_1 (to room_3).

Constraint 1 says I can't unlock red_door_1, so I can't directly go from room_1 to room_3. This means I need to find another route to room_3.

The only route available would be:
- Go from room_1 to room_2 via blue_door_1
- Go from room_2 to room_4 via yellow_door_1
- Go from room_4 to room_3 via green_door_1

Let's work on a plan:

1. I'm in room_1. I should stand in front of an empty position to satisfy constraint 3 before going to room_3.
2. Unlock blue_door_1.
3. Go to room_2 via blue_door_1.
4. Unlock yellow_door_1 to satisfy constraint 5.
5. Go to room_4 via yellow_door_1 to satisfy constraint 4.
6. Pick up grey_ball_1 in room_4.
7. Drop grey_ball_1 in room_4 (not necessary, just to free hands).
8. Unlock green_door_1 to satisfy constraint 7.
9. Go to room_3 via green_door_1 to satisfy constraint 2.
10. Pick up green_box_2 in room_3.
11. Stand in front of red_door_1 to satisfy constraint 10.
12. Go back to room_4 via green_door_1.
13. Go to room_2 via yellow_door_1.
14. Satisfy constraint 8: Ensure blue_door_1 is not locked (it already is since step 2) and hold green_box_2 (I'm already holding it since step 10).
15. Go to room_1 via blue_door_1.
16. Stand in front of yellow_door_1 or ensure grey_ball_1 is in room_1 to satisfy constraint 9. I might need to pick up grey_ball_1 in room_4 and take it to room_1.
17. Go back to room_2 via blue_door_1.
18. Go to room_4 via yellow_door_1.
19. Go to room_3 via green_door_1.
20. Drop green_box_2 in room_3.
21. Pick up green_box_1 in room_3.
22. Satisfy constraint 11: Hold green_box_1 and ensure blue_door_1 is not locked.
23. Stand in front of green_box_1 or green_box_2 to satisfy the goal.

But there are some issues with this plan. Let me reconsider.

Constraint 11 requires me to stand in front of red_door_1 and then at some point have blue_door_1 not locked and hold green_box_1. But constraint 1 says red_door_1 must always be locked. 

Actually, let me re-read and understand better. Constraint 1 says red_door_1 must always be locked, but constraint 10 says I need to stand in front of red_door_1, not necessarily unlock it.

Let's proceed with a refined plan:

1. I'm in room_1. I should go to empty position (gotoempty) to satisfy constraint 3 before going to room_3.
2. Now, I'll go to blue_door_1 (gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2).
3. Toggle blue_door_1 to unlock it (toggle blue_door_1).
4. Go to room_2 via blue_door_1 (gotoroom room_1 room_2 blue_door_1).
5. I'm now in room_2. I'll go to yellow_door_1 (gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_4).
6. Toggle yellow_door_1 to unlock it (toggle yellow_door_1). This satisfies constraint 5.
7. Go to room_4 via yellow_door_1 (gotoroom room_2 room_4 yellow_door_1). This satisfies constraint 4.
8. Go to green_door_1 (gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3).
9. Toggle green_door_1 to unlock it (toggle green_door_1). This satisfies constraint 7.
10. Go to room_3 via green_door_1 (gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1). This satisfies constraint 2.
11. Go to green_box_2 (gotoobject green_box_2 room_3).
12. Pick green_box_2 (pick green_box_2 room_3).
13. Go to red_door_1 (gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1). This satisfies constraint 10.
14. Go back to room_4 via green_door_1 (gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_1).
15. Go to yellow_door_1 (gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_2). This satisfies constraint 9.
16. Go to room_2 via yellow_door_1 (gotoroom room_4 room_2 yellow_door_1).
17. Go to blue_door_1 (gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1).
18. Go to room_1 via blue_door_1 (gotoroom room_2 room_1 blue_door_1). At this point, I'm in room_1, blue_door_1 is not locked, and I'm holding green_box_2. This satisfies constraint 8.
19. Now I need to return to room_3 to achieve the goal...

But wait, I just realized that I'm holding green_box_2 and need to drop it at some point because to satisfy constraint 11, I need to hold green_box_1. Let me adjust the plan:

1. I'm in room_1. I should go to empty position (gotoempty) to satisfy constraint 3 before going to room_3.
2. Now, I'll go to blue_door_1 (gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2).
3. Toggle blue_door_1 to unlock it (toggle blue_door_1).
4. Go to room_2 via blue_door_1 (gotoroom room_1 room_2 blue_door_1).
5. I'm now in room_2. I'll go to yellow_door_1 (gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_4).
6. Toggle yellow_door_1 to unlock it (toggle yellow_door_1). This satisfies constraint 5.
7. Go to room_4 via yellow_door_1 (gotoroom room_2 room_4 yellow_door_1). This satisfies constraint 4.
8. Go to green_door_1 (gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3).
9. Toggle green_door_1 to unlock it (toggle green_door_1). This satisfies constraint 7.
10. Go to room_3 via green_door_1 (gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1). This satisfies constraint 2.
11. Go to red_door_1 (gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1). This satisfies constraint 10.
12. Go to green_box_1 (gotoobject green_box_1 room_3).
13. Pick green_box_1 (pick green_box_1 room_3).
14. Go to room_4 via green_door_1 (gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_1).
15. Go to yellow_door_1 (gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_2). This satisfies constraint 9.
16. Go to room_2 via yellow_door_1 (gotoroom room_4 room_2 yellow_door_1).
17. Go to blue_door_1 (gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1).
18. At this point, I am holding green_box_1 and blue_door_1 is unlocked. This satisfies constraint 11.
19. Go to room_1 via blue_door_1 (gotoroom room_2 room_1 blue_door_1).
20. Drop green_box_1 in room_1 (drop green_box_1 room_1).
21. Pick up yellow_ball_1 (pick yellow_ball_1 room_1).
22. Go to blue_door_1 (gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2).
23. Go to room_2 via blue_door_1 (gotoroom room_1 room_2 blue_door_1).
24. Go to yellow_door_1 (gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_4).
25. Go to room_4 via yellow_door_1 (gotoroom room_2 room_4 yellow_door_1).
26. Go to green_door_1 (gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3).
27. Go to room_3 via green_door_1 (gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1).
28. Go to green_box_2 (gotoobject green_box_2 room_3).
29. Drop yellow_ball_1 (drop yellow_ball_1 room_3).
30. Pick green_box_2 (pick green_box_2 room_3).
31. Go to room_4 via green_door_1 (gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_1).
32. Go to yellow_door_1 (gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_2).
33. Go to room_2 via yellow_door_1 (gotoroom room_4 room_2 yellow_door_1).
34. Go to blue_door_1 (gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1).
35. Go to room_1 via blue_door_1 (gotoroom room_2 room_1 blue_door_1). At this point, I'm in room_1, blue_door_1 is not locked, and I'm holding green_box_2. This satisfies constraint 8.
36. Go to blue_door_1 (gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2).
37. Go to room_2 via blue_door_1 (gotoroom room_1 room_2 blue_door_1).
38. Go to yellow_door_1 (gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_4).
39. Go to room_4 via yellow_door_1 (gotoroom room_2 room_4 yellow_door_1).
40. Go to green_door_1 (gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3).
41. Go to room_3 via green_door_1 (gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1).
42. Drop green_box_2 (drop green_box_2 room_3).
43. Now I'm in front of green_box_2, which satisfies the goal.

This plan is quite lengthy and might not be the most efficient. Let me review it and see if there are ways to optimize.

Actually, let me ensure that I understand the goal correctly. The goal is to be in front of a green box. In my plan above, I end up in front of green_box_2 in room_3. Let's verify that this meets all the constraints.

I'm going to reconsider the plan and ensure it meets all constraints:

1. "red_door_1 is locked" - In my plan, I never unlock red_door_1, so this is satisfied.
2. "you are in room_3" - I am in room_3 at step 10, 27, and 41, so this is satisfied.
3. "If 'you are in room_3' holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which 'At least one of the following conditions is true: "you are in front of empty", "you are holding some object"'" - I stand in front of empty at step 1 (before going to room_3), so this is satisfied.
4. "you are in room_4" - I am in room_4 at step 7, 14, 25, 31, and 39, so this is satisfied.
5. "yellow_door_1 is not locked" - I unlock yellow_door_1 at step 6, so this is satisfied.
6. "you are in room_1" - I start in room_1, and also return at step 19 and 35, so this is satisfied.
7. "If 'you are in room_1' holds in some state s, then 'green_door_1 is not locked' must hold at s or at some state after s" - I unlock green_door_1 at step 9, which is after I start in room_1, so this is satisfied.
8. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'The following conditions are all true: "blue_door_1 is not locked", "you are holding green_box_2"'" - I am holding green_box_2 at step 35, and blue_door_1 is unlocked since step 3, so this is satisfied.
9. "At least one of the following conditions is true: 'grey_ball_1 is in room_1', 'you are in front of yellow_door_1'" - I stand in front of yellow_door_1 at step 15, so this is satisfied.
10. "you are in front of red_door_1" - I stand in front of red_door_1 at step 11, so this is satisfied.
11. "If 'you are in front of red_door_1' holds in some state s, then 'The following conditions are all true: "blue_door_1 is not locked", "you are holding green_box_1"' must hold at s or at some state after s" - I stand in front of red_door_1 at step 11, and at step 18, blue_door_1 is unlocked and I am holding green_box_1, so this is satisfied.

So the plan indeed satisfies all constraints.

But let me take another look and see if the plan can be simplified.

Actually, I can simplify the plan:

1. Step 1 to 11 remain the same.
2. From step 11, I go to green_box_1 and pick it up.
3. I go to room_4, room_2, and then I'm at blue_door_1 with green_box_1 in my hands, satisfying constraint 11.
4. I go to room_1, drop green_box_1, and go back to room_3 via the same path.
5. I pick up green_box_2, which satisfies constraint 8 when I go back to room_1.
6. I return to room_3, drop green_box_2, and I'm in front of a green box, satisfying the goal.

Let me try to simplify:

1. I'm in room_1. I go to an empty position (gotoempty) to satisfy constraint 3 before going to room_3.
2. I go to blue_door_1 (gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2).
3. Toggle blue_door_1 to unlock it (toggle blue_door_1).
4. Go to room_2 via blue_door_1 (gotoroom room_1 room_2 blue_door_1).
5. I go to yellow_door_1 (gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_4).
6. Toggle yellow_door_1 to unlock it (toggle yellow_door_1). This satisfies constraint 5.
7. Go to room_4 via yellow_door_1 (gotoroom room_2 room_4 yellow_door_1). This satisfies constraint 4.
8. I go to green_door_1 (gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3).
9. Toggle green_door_1 to unlock it (toggle green_door_1). This satisfies constraint 7.
10. Go to room_3 via green_door_1 (gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1). This satisfies constraint 2.
11. I go to red_door_1 (gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1). This satisfies constraint 10.
12. I go to green_box_1 (gotoobject green_box_1 room_3).
13. Pick green_box_1 (pick green_box_1 room_3).
14. Go to room_4 via green_door_1 (gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_1).
15. I go to yellow_door_1 (gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_2). This satisfies constraint 9.
16. Go to room_2 via yellow_door_1 (gotoroom room_4 room_2 yellow_door_1).
17. I go to blue_door_1 (gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1). At this point, I am holding green_box_1 and blue_door_1 is unlocked. This satisfies constraint 11.
18. Go to room_1 via blue_door_1 (gotoroom room_2 room_1 blue_door_1).
19. I drop green_box_1 (drop green_box_1 room_1).
20. I go to blue_door_1 (gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2).
21. Go to room_2 via blue_door_1 (gotoroom room_1 room_2 blue_door_1).
22. I go to yellow_door_1 (gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_4).
23. Go to room_4 via yellow_door_1 (gotoroom room_2 room_4 yellow_door_1).
24. I go to green_door_1 (gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3).
25. Go to room_3 via green_door_1 (gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1).
26. I go to green_box_2 (gotoobject green_box_2 room_3).
27. Pick green_box_2 (pick green_box_2 room_3).
28. Go to room_4 via green_door_1 (gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_1).
29. I go to yellow_door_1 (gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_2).
30. Go to room_2 via yellow_door_1 (gotoroom room_4 room_2 yellow_door_1).
31. I go to blue_door_1 (gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1).
32. Go to room_1 via blue_door_1 (gotoroom room_2 room_1 blue_door_1). At this point, I'm in room_1, blue_door_1 is not locked, and I'm holding green_box_2. This satisfies constraint 8.
33. I go to blue_door_1 (gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2).
34. Go to room_2 via blue_door_1 (gotoroom room_1 room_2 blue_door_1).
35. I go to yellow_door_1 (gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_4).
36. Go to room_4 via yellow_door_1 (gotoroom room_2 room_4 yellow_door_1).
37. I go to green_door_1 (gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3).
38. Go to room_3 via green_door_1 (gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1).
39. Drop green_box_2 (drop green_box_2 room_3).
40. Now I'm in front of green_box_2, which satisfies the goal.

This plan still seems a bit long, but I think it's better. I'm trying to see if there are any more redundancies:

- I'm going back and forth between rooms a lot.
- I pick up, drop, and re-pick up objects multiple times.

Let's try to streamline the plan:

1. I'm in room_1. I go to an empty position (gotoempty) to satisfy constraint 3 before going to room_3.
2. I go to blue_door_1 (gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2).
3. Toggle blue_door_1 to unlock it (toggle blue_door_1).
4. Go to room_2 via blue_door_1 (gotoroom room_1 room_2 blue_door_1).
5. I go to yellow_door_1 (gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_4).
6. Toggle yellow_door_1 to unlock it (toggle yellow_door_1). This satisfies constraint 5.
7. Go to room_4 via yellow_door_1 (gotoroom room_2 room_4 yellow_door_1). This satisfies constraint 4.
8. I go to green_door_1 (gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3).
9. Toggle green_door_1 to unlock it (toggle green_door_1). This satisfies constraint 7.
10. Go to room_3 via green_door_1 (gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1). This satisfies constraint 2.
11. I go to red_door_1 (gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1). This satisfies constraint 10.
12. I go to green_box_1 (gotoobject green_box_1 room_3).
13. Pick green_box_1 (pick green_box_1 room_3).
14. I go to green_door_1 (gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4).
15. Go to room_4 via green_door_1 (gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_1).
16. I go to yellow_door_1 (gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_2). This satisfies constraint 9.
17. Go to room_2 via yellow_door_1 (gotoroom room_4 room_2 yellow_door_1).
18. I go to blue_door_1 (gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1). At this point, I am holding green_box_1 and blue_door_1 is unlocked. This satisfies constraint 11.
19. I drop green_box_1 (drop green_box_1 room_2).
20. I go to yellow_door_1 (gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_4).
21. Go to room_4 via yellow_door_1 (gotoroom room_2 room_4 yellow_door_1).
22. I go to green_door_1 (gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3).
23. Go to room_3 via green_door_1 (gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1).
24. I go to green_box_2 (gotoobject green_box_2 room_3).
25. Pick green_box_2 (pick green_box_2 room_3).
26. I go to green_door_1 (gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4).
27. Go to room_4 via green_door_1 (gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_1).
28. I go to yellow_door_1 (gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_2).
29. Go to room_2 via yellow_door_1 (gotoroom room_4 room_2 yellow_door_1).
30. I go to blue_door_1 (gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1).
31. Go to room_1 via blue_door_1 (gotoroom room_2 room_1 blue_door_1). At this point, I'm in room_1, blue_door_1 is not locked, and I'm holding green_box_2. This satisfies constraint 8.
32. I go to blue_door_1 (gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2).
33. Go to room_2 via blue_door_1 (gotoroom room_1 room_2 blue_door_1).
34. I go to yellow_door_1 (gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_4).
35. Go to room_4 via yellow_door_1 (gotoroom room_2 room_4 yellow_door_1).
36. I go to green_door_1 (gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3).
37. Go to room_3 via green_door_1 (gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1).
38. I go to green_box_1 (gotoobject green_box_1 room_3).

Hold on, I think I'm misremembering the effects of the actions. Let me re-check the "drop" action:

"drop": After performing this action regarding an object x, (i) you are no longer carrying x, (ii) you are in front of x, (iii) your hands are empty, and (iv) object x is situated in the room you are currently in.

So when I drop an object, I will automatically be in front of it.

Let's reconsider once more:

1. I'm in room_1. I go to an empty position (gotoempty) to satisfy constraint 3 before going to room_3.
2. I go to blue_door_1 (gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2).
3. Toggle blue_door_1 to unlock it (toggle blue_door_1).
4. Go to room_2 via blue_door_1 (gotoroom room_1 room_2 blue_door_1).
5. I go to yellow_door_1 (gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_4).
6. Toggle yellow_door_1 to unlock it (toggle yellow_door_1). This satisfies constraint 5.
7. Go to room_4 via yellow_door_1 (gotoroom room_2 room_4 yellow_door_1). This satisfies constraint 4.
8. I go to green_door_1 (gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3).
9. Toggle green_door_1 to unlock it (toggle green_door_1). This satisfies constraint 7.
10. Go to room_3 via green_door_1 (gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1). This satisfies constraint 2.
11. I go to red_door_1 (gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1). This satisfies constraint 10.
12. I go to green_box_1 (gotoobject green_box_1 room_3).
13. Pick green_box_1 (pick green_box_1 room_3).
14. I go to green_door_1 (gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4).
15. Go to room_4 via green_door_1 (gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_1).
16. I go to yellow_door_1 (gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_2). This satisfies constraint 9.
17. Go to room_2 via yellow_door_1 (gotoroom room_4 room_2 yellow_door_1).
18. I go to blue_door_1 (gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1). At this point, I am holding green_box_1 and blue_door_1 is unlocked. This satisfies constraint 11.
19. Go to room_1 via blue_door_1 (gotoroom room_2 room_1 blue_door_1).
20. I go to blue_door_1 (gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2).
21. Go to room_2 via blue_door_1 (gotoroom room_1 room_2 blue_door_1).
22. I go to yellow_door_1 (gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_4).
23. Go to room_4 via yellow_door_1 (gotoroom room_2 room_4 yellow_door_1).
24. I go to green_door_1 (gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3).
25. Go to room_3 via green_door_1 (gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1).
26. I go to green_box_2 (gotoobject green_box_2 room_3).
27. Drop green_box_1 (drop green_box_1 room_3). Now I'm in front of green_box_1, which satisfies the goal. But let's continue to fulfill all constraints.
28. Pick green_box_2 (pick green_box_2 room_3).
29. I go to green_door_1 (gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4).
30. Go to room_4 via green_door_1 (gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_1).
31. I go to yellow_door_1 (gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_2).
32. Go to room_2 via yellow_door_1 (gotoroom room_4 room_2 yellow_door_1).
33. I go to blue_door_1 (gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1).
34. Go to room_1 via blue_door_1 (gotoroom room_2 room_1 blue_door_1). At this point, I'm in room_1, blue_door_1 is not locked, and I'm holding green_box_2. This satisfies constraint 8.
35. I go to blue_door_1 (gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2).
36. Go to room_2 via blue_door_1 (gotoroom room_1 room_2 blue_door_1).
37. I go to yellow_door_1 (gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_4).
38. Go to room_4 via yellow_door_1 (gotoroom room_2 room_4 yellow_door_1).
39. I go to green_door_1 (gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3).
40. Go to room_3 via green_door_1 (gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1).
41. Drop green_box_2 (drop green_box_2 room_3). Now I'm in front of green_box_2, which also satisfies the goal.

But hang on, in this revised plan, since I'm already in front of green_box_1 at step 27, I've already satisfied the goal. So I can stop there. Actually, to be thorough, let me check if I've satisfied all constraints up to step 27:

1. "red_door_1 is locked" - I never unlock red_door_1, so this is satisfied.
2. "you are in room_3" - I am in room_3 at step 10 and 25, so this is satisfied.
3. "If 'you are in room_3' holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which 'At least one of the following conditions is true: "you are in front of empty", "you are holding some object"'" - I stand in front of empty at step 1 (before going to room_3), so this is satisfied.
4. "you are in room_4" - I am in room_4 at step 7, 15, and 23, so this is satisfied.
5. "yellow_door_1 is not locked" - I unlock yellow_door_1 at step 6, so this is satisfied.
6. "you are in room_1" - I start in room_1, and also return at step 19, so this is satisfied.
7. "If 'you are in room_1' holds in some state s, then 'green_door_1 is not locked' must hold at s or at some state after s" - I unlock green_door_1 at step 9, which is after I start in room_1, so this is satisfied.
8. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'The following conditions are all true: "blue_door_1 is not locked", "you are holding green_box_2"'" - Hmm, this is not satisfied up to step 27. I need to pick up green_box_2 and have blue_door_1 unlocked at the same time.
9. "At least one of the following conditions is true: 'grey_ball_1 is in room_1', 'you are in front of yellow_door_1'" - I stand in front of yellow_door_1 at step 16, so this is satisfied.
10. "you are in front of red_door_1" - I stand in front of red_door_1 at step 11, so this is satisfied.
11. "If 'you are in front of red_door_1' holds in some state s, then 'The following conditions are all true: "blue_door_1 is not locked", "you are holding green_box_1"' must hold at s or at some state after s" - I stand in front of red_door_1 at step 11, and at step 18, blue_door_1 is unlocked and I am holding green_box_1, so this is satisfied.

So I haven't satisfied constraint 8 yet, so I need to proceed further.

In this case, I think the full plan above is the most efficient way to satisfy all constraints and achieve the goal. Let's reconsider one more time to ensure I'm optimizing.

Actually, I think I can optimize by swapping the order of picking up the green boxes:

1. I'm in room_1. I go to an empty position (gotoempty) to satisfy constraint 3 before going to room_3.
2. I go to blue_door_1 (gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2).
3. Toggle blue_door_1 to unlock it (toggle blue_door_1).
4. Go to room_2 via blue_door_1 (gotoroom room_1 room_2 blue_door_1).
5. I go to yellow_door_1 (gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_4).
6. Toggle yellow_door_1 to unlock it (toggle yellow_door_1). This satisfies constraint 5.
7. Go to room_4 via yellow_door_1 (gotoroom room_2 room_4 yellow_door_1). This satisfies constraint 4.
8. I go to green_door_1 (gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3).
9. Toggle green_door_1 to unlock it (toggle green_door_1). This satisfies constraint 7.
10. Go to room_3 via green_door_1 (gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1). This satisfies constraint 2.
11. I go to red_door_1 (gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1). This satisfies constraint 10.
12. I go to green_box_2 (gotoobject green_box_2 room_3).
13. Pick green_box_2 (pick green_box_2 room_3).
14. I go to green_door_1 (gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4).
15. Go to room_4 via green_door_1 (gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_1).
16. I go to yellow_door_1 (gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_2). This satisfies constraint 9.
17. Go to room_2 via yellow_door_1 (gotoroom room_4 room_2 yellow_door_1).
18. I go to blue_door_1 (gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1).
19. Go to room_1 via blue_door_1 (gotoroom room_2 room_1 blue_door_1). At this point, I'm in room_1, blue_door_1 is not locked, and I'm holding green_box_2. This satisfies constraint 8.
20. I go to blue_door_1 (gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2).
21. Go to room_2 via blue_door_1 (gotoroom room_1 room_2 blue_door_1).
22. I drop green_box_2 (drop green_box_2 room_2). Now I'm in front of green_box_2, but this doesn't satisfy the goal because I'm not in room_3. green_box_2 is not green.
23. I go to yellow_door_1 (gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_4).
24. Go to room_4 via yellow_door_1 (gotoroom room_2 room_4 yellow_door_1).
25. I go to green_door_1 (gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3).
26. Go to room_3 via green_door_1 (gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1).
27. I go to green_box_1 (gotoobject green_box_1 room_3).
28. Pick green_box_1 (pick green_box_1 room_3).
29. I go to green_door_1 (gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4).
30. Go to room_4 via green_door_1 (gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_1).
31. I go to yellow_door_1 (gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_2).
32. Go to room_2 via yellow_door_1 (gotoroom room_4 room_2 yellow_door_1).
33. I go to blue_door_1 (gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1). At this point, I am holding green_box_1 and blue_door_1 is unlocked. This satisfies constraint 11.
34. I go to yellow_door_1 (gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_4).
35. Go to room_4 via yellow_door_1 (gotoroom room_2 room_4 yellow_door_1).
36. I go to green_door_1 (gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3).
37. Go to room_3 via green_door_1 (gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1).
38. I go to gotoempty (gotoempty).
39. Drop green_box_1 (drop green_box_1 room_3). Now I'm in front of green_box_1, which satisfies the goal.

Actually, this doesn't save us any steps. Let's try once more, focusing on the immediate goal:

1. I'm in room_1. I go to an empty position (gotoempty) to satisfy constraint 3 before going to room_3.
2. I go to blue_door_1 (gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2).
3. Toggle blue_door_1 to unlock it (toggle blue_door_1).
4. Go to room_2 via blue_door_1 (gotoroom room_1 room_2 blue_door_1).
5. I go to yellow_door_1 (gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_4).
6. Toggle yellow_door_1 to unlock it (toggle yellow_door_1). This satisfies constraint 5.
7. Go to room_4 via yellow_door_1 (gotoroom room_2 room_4 yellow_door_1). This satisfies constraint 4.
8. I go to green_door_1 (gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3).
9. Toggle green_door_1 to unlock it (toggle green_door_1). This satisfies constraint 7.
10. Go to room_3 via green_door_1 (gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1). This satisfies constraint 2.
11. I go to green_box_1 (gotoobject green_box_1 room_3). Now I'm in front of a green box, which satisfies the goal.

But if I stop at this step 11, I'm not satisfying all constraints:
- Constraint 8 requires me to be holding green_box_2 with blue_door_1 unlocked.
- Constraint 10 requires me to be in front of red_door_1.
- Constraint 11 requires that after being in front of red_door_1, I must be holding green_box_1 with blue_door_1 unlocked.

So I need to continue the plan:

12. I go to red_door_1 (gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1). This satisfies constraint 10.
13. I go to green_box_1 (gotoobject green_box_1 room_3).
14. Pick green_box_1 (pick green_box_1 room_3).
15. I go to green_door_1 (gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4).
16. Go to room_4 via green_door_1 (gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_1).
17. I go to yellow_door_1 (gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_2). This satisfies constraint 9.
18. Go to room_2 via yellow_door_1 (gotoroom room_4 room_2 yellow_door_1).
19. I go to blue_door_1 (gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1). At this point, I am holding green_box_1 and blue_door_1 is unlocked. This satisfies constraint 11.
20. I drop green_box_1 (drop green_box_1 room_2).
21. I go to yellow_door_1 (gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_4).
22. Go to room_4 via yellow_door_1 (gotoroom room_2 room_4 yellow_door_1).
23. I go to green_door_1 (gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3).
24. Go to room_3 via green_door_1 (gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1).
25. I go to green_box_2 (gotoobject green_box_2 room_3).
26. Pick green_box_2 (pick green_box_2 room_3).
27. I go to green_door_1 (gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4).
28. Go to room_4 via green_door_1 (gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_1).
29. I go to yellow_door_1 (gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_2).
30. Go to room_2 via yellow_door_1 (gotoroom room_4 room_2 yellow_door_1).
31. I go to blue_door_1 (gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1).
32. Go to room_1 via blue_door_1 (gotoroom room_2 room_1 blue_door_1). At this point, I'm in room_1, blue_door_1 is not locked, and I'm holding green_box_2. This satisfies constraint 8.
33. I go to blue_door_1 (gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2).
34. Go to room_2 via blue_door_1 (gotoroom room_1 room_2 blue_door_1).
35. I go to yellow_door_1 (gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_4).
36. Go to room_4 via yellow_door_1 (gotoroom room_2 room_4 yellow_door_1).
37. I go to green_door_1 (gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3).
38. Go to room_3 via green_door_1 (gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1).
39. I go to gotoempty (gotoempty).
40. Drop green_box_2 (drop green_box_2 room_3). Now I'm in front of green_box_2, which also satisfies the goal.

Actually, this plan seems quite efficient, given the constraints. Let me see if I can shave off any more steps...

I wonder, actually, if I accomplish the goal at step 11, whether we need to satisfy all of the constraints. Let me double-check the task...

The task is to provide a valid sequence of actions that solves the planning problem, i.e., bringing about the goal of the problem while satisfying all constraints.

This implies that I need to satisfy all constraints regardless of when I accomplish the goal. Let me think about whether there's a more efficient plan.

Actually, I wonder if I misunderstood the specification of the plan. The specification says: "A valid plan for the abovementioned problem must abide by the following constraints."

This suggests that the validity of the plan is determined by whether it satisfies all the constraints, not whether every constraint is satisfied in a single state. Let me re-read the constraints to ensure I'm understanding them correctly.

Actually, I think what's happening is that some of the constraints specify that "if X holds in some state, then Y must hold in that state or a later state." If X never holds in any state, then the constraint is trivially satisfied. For other constraints, the constraint is that "X must hold in at least one state."

So to satisfy all constraints, I need to ensure:
1. At every state: red_door_1 is locked.
2. At at least one state: I'm in room_3.
3. If I'm in room_3, there was a previous state where I was in front of empty or holding an object.
4. At at least one state: I'm in room_4.
5. At at least one state: yellow_door_1 is not locked.
6. At at least one state: I'm in room_1.
7. If I'm in room_1, then at that state or a later state, green_door_1 is not locked.
8. At at least one state: blue_door_1 is not locked and I'm holding green_box_2.
9. At at least one state: grey_ball_1 is in room_1 or I'm in front of yellow_door_1.
10. At at least one state: I'm in front of red_door_1.
11. If I'm in front of red_door_1, then at that state or a later state, blue_door_1 is not locked and I'm holding green_box_1.

So, to be explicit, these are the states I need to ensure occur in my plan:
- At every state: red_door_1 is locked.
- At at least one state: I'm in room_3.
- At at least one state: I'm in room_4.
- At at least one state: yellow_door_1 is not locked.
- At at least one state: I'm in room_1. (This is already satisfied at the start.)
- At at least one state: blue_door_1 is not locked and I'm holding green_box_2.
- At at least one state: grey_ball_1 is in room_1 or I'm in front of yellow_door_1.
- At at least one state: I'm in front of red_door_1.
- At at least one state: blue_door_1 is not locked and I'm holding green_box_1.

And there are these implication constraints:
- If I'm in room_3, there was a previous state where I was in front of empty or holding an object.
- If I'm in room_1, then at that state or a later state, green_door_1 is not locked.
- If I'm in front of red_door_1, then at that state or a later state, blue_door_1 is not locked and I'm holding green_box_1.

So now let's design a plan to satisfy the goal (be in front of a green box) and all these constraints:

1. I'm in room_1. I go to an empty position (gotoempty) to satisfy the requirement that before being in room_3, I was in front of empty.
2. I go to blue_door_1 (gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2).
3. Toggle blue_door_1 to unlock it (toggle blue_door_1).
4. Go to room_2 via blue_door_1 (gotoroom room_1 room_2 blue_door_1).
5. I go to yellow_door_1 (gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_4).
6. Toggle yellow_door_1 to unlock it (toggle yellow_door_1). This satisfies the requirement for yellow_door_1 to be unlocked at some state.
7. Go to room_4 via yellow_door_1 (gotoroom room_2 room_4 yellow_door_1). This satisfies the requirement to be in room_4 at some state.
8. I go to green_door_1 (gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3).
9. Toggle green_door_1 to unlock it (toggle green_door_1). This satisfies the requirement that after being in room_1, at some point green_door_1 is unlocked.
10. Go to room_3 via green_door_1 (gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1). This satisfies the requirement to be in room_3 at some state.
11. I go to red_door_1 (gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1). This satisfies the requirement to be in front of red_door_1 at some state.
12. I go to green_box_1 (gotoobject green_box_1 room_3).
13. Pick green_box_1 (pick green_box_1 room_3).
14. I go to green_door_1 (gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4).
15. Go to room_4 via green_door_1 (gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_1).
16. I go to yellow_door_1 (gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_2). This satisfies the requirement for grey_ball_1 to be in room_1 or being in front of yellow_door_1 at some state.
17. Go to room_2 via yellow_door_1 (gotoroom room_4 room_2 yellow_door_1).
18. I go to blue_door_1 (gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1). At this point, blue_door_1 is unlocked and I'm holding green_box_1. This satisfies the requirement that after being in front of red_door_1, at some point blue_door_1 is unlocked and I'm holding green_box_1.
19. I drop green_box_1 (drop green_box_1 room_2).
20. I go to yellow_door_1 (gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_4).
21. Go to room_4 via yellow_door_1 (gotoroom room_2 room_4 yellow_door_1).
22. I go to green_door_1 (gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3).
23. Go to room_3 via green_door_1 (gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1).
24. I go to green_box_2 (gotoobject green_box_2 room_3).
25. Pick green_box_2 (pick green_box_2 room_3).
26. I go to green_door_1 (gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4).
27. Go to room_4 via green_door_1 (gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_1).
28. I go to yellow_door_1 (gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_2).
29. Go to room_2 via yellow_door_1 (gotoroom room_4 room_2 yellow_door_1).
30. I go to blue_door_1 (gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1).
31. Go to room_1 via blue_door_1 (gotoroom room_2 room_1 blue_door_1). At this point, blue_door_1 is unlocked and I'm holding green_box_2. This satisfies the requirement for blue_door_1 to be unlocked and holding green_box_2 at some state.
32. I go to blue_door_1 (gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2).
33. Go to room_2 via blue_door_1 (gotoroom room_1 room_2 blue_door_1).
34. I go to yellow_door_1 (gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_4).
35. Go to room_4 via yellow_door_1 (gotoroom room_2 room_4 yellow_door_1).
36. I go to green_door_1 (gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3).
37. Go to room_3 via green_door_1 (gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1).
38. I drop green_box_2 (drop green_box_2 room_3). Now I'm in front of green_box_2, which satisfies the goal.

But that's a lot of steps. Let's see if I can accomplish the goal more efficiently.

Let's consider a strategy to more efficiently satisfy the goal and all the constraints.

I'm starting to think that given the constraint to be holding green_box_1 after going to red_door_1, and the goal to end in front of a green box, it might be most efficient to work towards that goal to satisfy both.

Let me reconsider:

1. I'm in room_1. I do "gotoempty" to satisfy the constraint for room_3 (constraint 3).
2. I go to blue_door_1 (gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2).
3. Toggle blue_door_1 to unlock it (toggle blue_door_1).
4. Go to room_2 via blue_door_1 (gotoroom room_1 room_2 blue_door_1).
5. I go to yellow_door_1 (gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_4). This satisfies constraint 9.
6. Toggle yellow_door_1 to unlock it (toggle yellow_door_1). This satisfies constraint 5.
7. Go to room_4 via yellow_door_1 (gotoroom room_2 room_4 yellow_door_1). This satisfies constraint 4.
8. I go to green_door_1 (gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3).
9. Toggle green_door_1 to unlock it (toggle green_door_1). This satisfies constraint 7.
10. Go to room_3 via green_door_1 (gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1). This satisfies constraint 2.
11. I go to red_door_1 (gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1). This satisfies constraint 10.
12. I go to green_box_1 (gotoobject green_box_1 room_3).
13. Pick green_box_1 (pick green_box_1 room_3).
14. I go to green_door_1 (gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4).
15. Go to room_4 via green_door_1 (gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_1).
16. I go to yellow_door_1 (gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_2).
17. Go to room_2 via yellow_door_1 (gotoroom room_4 room_2 yellow_door_1).
18. I go to blue_door_1 (gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1). At this point, I am holding green_box_1 and blue_door_1 is unlocked. This satisfies constraint 11.
19. I go to yellow_door_1 (gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_4).
20. Go to room_4 via yellow_door_1 (gotoroom room_2 room_4 yellow_door_1).
21. I go to green_door_1 (gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3).
22. Go to room_3 via green_door_1 (gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1).
23. I go to green_box_2 (gotoobject green_box_2 room_3).
24. Drop green_box_1 (drop green_box_1 room_3). Now I'm in front of green_box_1, which satisfies the goal.
25. Pick green_box_2 (pick green_box_2 room_3).
26. I go to green_door_1 (gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4).
27. Go to room_4 via green_door_1 (gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_1).
28. I go to yellow_door_1 (gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_2).
29. Go to room_2 via yellow_door_1 (gotoroom room_4 room_2 yellow_door_1).
30. I go to blue_door_1 (gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1).
31. Go to room_1 via blue_door_1 (gotoroom room_2 room_1 blue_door_1). At this point, blue_door_1 is unlocked and I'm holding green_box_2. This satisfies constraint 8.

Actually, actually, since we're at step 24, the goal is satisfied and all constraints are also met. Let me double-check:

- Constraint 1: red_door_1 is locked. ✓ (It's always locked in my plan.)
- Constraint 2: I need to be in room_3 at some state. ✓ (I'm in room_3 at step 24.)
- Constraint 3: Before being in room_3, I was in front of empty. ✓ (I went to empty at step 1, which is before entering room_3 at step 10.)
- Constraint 4: I need to be in room_4 at some state. ✓ (I was in room_4 at steps 7, 15, 20.)
- Constraint 5: yellow_door_1 needs to be unlocked at some state. ✓ (I unlocked it at step 6.)
- Constraint 6: I need to be in room_1 at some state. ✓ (I was already in room_1 at the start.)
- Constraint 7: After being in room_1, green_door_1 needs to be unlocked at some state. ✓ (I unlocked it at step 9.)
- Constraint 8: blue_door_1 needs to be unlocked and I need to be holding green_box_2 at some state. ✗ (I haven't accomplished this by step 24.)
- Constraint 9: grey_ball_1 needs to be in room_1 or I need to be in front of yellow_door_1 at some state. ✓ (I was in front of yellow_door_1 at steps 5, 16.)
- Constraint 10: I need to be in front of red_door_1 at some state. ✓ (I was at step 11.)
- Constraint 11: After being in front of red_door_1, blue_door_1 needs to be unlocked and I need to be holding green_box_1 at some state. ✓ (This happened at step 18.)

So I haven't satisfied constraint 8 yet. I need to continue to step 31, at which point all constraints are satisfied and I've already accomplished the goal at step 24.

Actually I can optimize the plan after step 24:

1. I'm in room_1. I do "gotoempty" to satisfy the constraint for room_3 (constraint 3).
2. I go to blue_door_1 (gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2).
3. Toggle blue_door_1 to unlock it (toggle blue_door_1).
4. Go to room_2 via blue_door_1 (gotoroom room_1 room_2 blue_door_1).
5. I go to yellow_door_1 (gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_4). This satisfies constraint 9.
6. Toggle yellow_door_1 to unlock it (toggle yellow_door_1). This satisfies constraint 5.
7. Go to room_4 via yellow_door_1 (gotoroom room_2 room_4 yellow_door_1). This satisfies constraint 4.
8. I go to green_door_1 (gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3).
9. Toggle green_door_1 to unlock it (toggle green_door_1). This satisfies constraint 7.
10. Go to room_3 via green_door_1 (gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1). This satisfies constraint 2.
11. I go to red_door_1 (gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1). This satisfies constraint 10.
12. I go to green_box_1 (gotoobject green_box_1 room_3).
13. Pick green_box_1 (pick green_box_1 room_3).
14. I go to green_door_1 (gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4).
15. Go to room_4 via green_door_1 (gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_1).
16. I go to yellow_door_1 (gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_2).
17. Go to room_2 via yellow_door_1 (gotoroom room_4 room_2 yellow_door_1).
18. I go to blue_door_1 (gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1). At this point, I am holding green_box_1 and blue_door_1 is unlocked. This satisfies constraint 11.
19. I go to yellow_door_1 (gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_4).
20. Go to room_4 via yellow_door_1 (gotoroom room_2 room_4 yellow_door_1).
21. I go to green_door_1 (gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3).
22. Go to room_3 via green_door_1 (gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1).
23. I go to green_box_2 (gotoobject green_box_2 room_3).
24. Drop green_box_1 (drop green_box_1 room_3). Now I'm in front of green_box_1, which satisfies the goal.
25. Pick green_box_2 (pick green_box_2 room_3).
26. I go to green_door_1 (gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4).
27. Go to room_4 via green_door_1 (gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_1).
28. I go to yellow_door_1 (gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_2).
29. Go to room_2 via yellow_door_1 (gotoroom room_4 room_2 yellow_door_1).
30. I go to blue_door_1 (gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1).
31. Go to room_1 via blue_door_1 (gotoroom room_2 room_1 blue_door_1). At this point, blue_door_1 is unlocked and I'm holding green_box_2. This satisfies constraint 8.

Actually, I think that's right.

Let me check that all the constraints are satisfied:

- Constraint 1: red_door_1 is locked. ✓ (It's always locked in my plan.)
- Constraint 2: I need to be in room_3 at some state. ✓ (I'm in room_3 at steps 10, 22, etc.)
- Constraint 3: Before being in room_3, I was in front of empty. ✓ (I went to empty at step 1, which is before entering room_3 at step 10.)
- Constraint 4: I need to be in room_4 at some state. ✓ (I was in room_4 at steps 7, 15, 20, etc.)
- Constraint 5: yellow_door_1 needs to be unlocked at some state. ✓ (I unlocked it at step 6.)
- Constraint 6: I need to be in room_1 at some state. ✓ (I was already in room_1 at the start.)
- Constraint 7: After being in room_1, green_door_1 needs to be unlocked at some state. ✓ (I unlocked it at step 9.)
- Constraint 8: blue_door_1 needs to be unlocked and I need to be holding green_box_2 at some state. ✓ (I accomplished this at step 31.)
- Constraint 9: grey_ball_1 needs to be in room_1 or I need to be in front of yellow_door_1 at some state. ✓ (I was in front of yellow_door_1 at steps 5, 16, etc.)
- Constraint 10: I need to be in front of red_door_1 at some state. ✓ (I was at step 11.)
- Constraint 11: After being in front of red_door_1, blue_door_1 needs to be unlocked and I need to be holding green_box_1 at some state. ✓ (This happened at step 18.)

All constraints are satisfied, and the goal is achieved at step 24.
