Okay, let me try to figure out how to solve this planning problem. The goal is to get a yellow ball that I'm in front of. The initial state says the yellow_ball_1 is in room_2, where I start. But wait, the final goal is to have a yellow ball v such that I'm in front of it. So maybe I can just go to the yellow_ball_1 in room_2 and be in front of it. But I need to check the constraints and make sure all of them are satisfied in at least one state during the plan.

First, let's list the constraints:

1. At some state, yellow_door_1 is unlocked.
2. At some state, either yellow_box_1 is in room_3 or I'm in front of green_ball_1.
3. At some state, either I'm holding an object or in front of yellow_door_1.
4. At some state, yellow_box_2 is in room_3.
5. At some state, I'm in room_3.
6. At some state, I'm in room_4.

So the plan must include actions that make all these conditions true at least once. Let's see.

Starting in room_2. The yellow_ball_1 is there. But if I just go to it and pick it up, maybe that's not enough because I need to satisfy all constraints. Wait, but the goal is to be in front of a yellow ball. So maybe I can do that in room_2. But let's check the constraints.

Constraints 5 and 6 require me to be in room_3 and room_4 at some point. So I have to move through rooms. Also, the yellow_box_2 is in room_4 initially, and the constraint requires it to be in room_3. So I need to move yellow_box_2 from room_4 to room_3. But how? Since boxes are in rooms, maybe I need to pick them up and drop them. But the boxes can only be moved if I can get to them. Also, doors are locked initially. Let's check the doors:

Doors:

purple_door_1 (connects room_1 and room_2) is locked.
yellow_door_1 (connects room_1 and room_3) is locked.
grey_door_1 (connects room_2 and room_4) is locked.
purple_door_2 (connects room_3 and room_4) is locked.

All doors are locked. So I need to unlock some doors to move between rooms. But to unlock a door, I need to toggle it, which requires being in front of it. But to get in front of a door, I need to go to it from the current room. However, doors are blocked if there's an object in front of them. Wait, the preconditions for "goto door" say that there's no object blocking the position in front of the door in the current room. So if there's a box or ball in front of the door, I can't go there. But how do I know where objects are located? The initial state lists objects in rooms. For example, purple_box_1 is in room_1. The yellow_ball_1 is in room_2. So perhaps the doors are not blocked by objects, unless specified. The problem doesn't mention any objects blocking doors initially, so maybe I can assume that the doors are accessible if I can reach them.

But since all doors are locked, I can't move through them unless I unlock them. But to unlock a door, I need to toggle it. So first, I need to go to the door, then toggle it. But to go to the door, I need to be in a room connected by that door. Let's see. Starting in room_2. The doors connected to room_2 are purple_door_1 (to room_1) and grey_door_1 (to room_4). So from room_2, I can go to purple_door_1 or grey_door_1. But both are locked, so I can't go through them yet. But to unlock them, I need to toggle them. So first, I need to go to the door (while in room_2) and toggle it. Let's take purple_door_1. So:

Action: gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1. Wait, the gotodoor action's arguments are the door and the two rooms it connects. The syntax is "gotodoor d r1 r2". So from room_2, purple_door_1 connects to room_1. So in room_2, I can do gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1. Then toggle it. Then go through to room_1. But why would I need to go to room_1? Maybe not. Alternatively, unlock grey_door_1 in room_2, which connects to room_4. Then go to room_4. But the constraint requires being in room_4 and room_3. So let's think.

The constraints require me to be in room_3 and room_4. Also, moving yellow_box_2 from room_4 to room_3. So perhaps the plan involves moving from room_2 to room_4 via grey_door_1, then to room_3 via purple_door_2, but that door is locked. So maybe need to unlock multiple doors.

Let me outline possible steps:

1. In room_2, go to grey_door_1 (connects room_2 and room_4). Precondition: I'm in room_2, which is connected via grey_door_1. No object is blocking the door. So "gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_4". Then toggle (unlock) it. Then go to room_4. Now I'm in room_4. That satisfies constraint 6.

In room_4, there's yellow_box_2 and green_ball_1. To move yellow_box_2 to room_3, I need to pick it up and drop it in room_3. But to get to room_3 from room_4, I need to go through purple_door_2, which connects room_3 and room_4. But that door is locked. So I need to unlock it. But I'm in room_4, so I can go to purple_door_2 (which connects room_4 and room_3), then toggle it. But first, I need to get in front of it. So:

In room_4, do gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_3. Then toggle it (unlock). Then go to room_3. Now in room_3, which satisfies constraint 5.

Once in room_3, I can drop yellow_box_2 here. But wait, I need to have picked it up from room_4. So steps:

After entering room_4 from room_2 via grey_door_1 (after unlocking it), then in room_4:

- Gotoobject yellow_box_2 room_4 (if possible). Then pick it up. Then go to door purple_door_2, unlock it, then go to room_3, drop yellow_box_2 there. This would satisfy constraint 4 (yellow_box_2 is in room_3).

But let's check the steps:

Starting in room_2:

1. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_4
2. toggle grey_door_1 (unlocks it)
3. gotoroom room_2 room_4 grey_door_1 (now in room_4)
   - Now in room_4, constraint 6 is satisfied.

In room_4:

4. gotoobject yellow_box_2 room_4 (since it's in room_4)
5. pick yellow_box_2 room_4 (now holding it)
   - Now, constraint 3: holding an object is true. So this state satisfies constraint 3.

6. drop yellow_box_2 room_4 (Wait, no. Because we need to take it to room_3. Wait, no. Wait, we need to drop it in room_3. So after picking it up, need to go to room_3.

But to get to room_3 from room_4, need to go through purple_door_2. Which is locked. So:

In room_4:

4. gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_3
5. toggle purple_door_2 (unlock)
6. gotoroom room_4 room_3 purple_door_2 (now in room_3)
7. drop yellow_box_2 room_3 (since I'm in room_3 now, and holding it)
   - Now, yellow_box_2 is in room_3, satisfying constraint 4.

Now, in room_3, which has blue_box_1 and green_box_2.

But another constraint is that yellow_door_1 must be unlocked. Yellow_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3. So to unlock it, I need to be in front of it. To get there, I need to go from room_3 to room_1 via yellow_door_1. But initially, yellow_door_1 is locked. So I need to unlock it. But I'm in room_3. So:

In room_3:

8. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1
9. toggle yellow_door_1 (unlock)
   - Now, constraint 1 is satisfied (yellow_door_1 is not locked).

Then, perhaps move to room_1. But why? Because another constraint is that either yellow_box_1 is in room_3 or I'm in front of green_ball_1. Currently, green_ball_1 is in room_4. So to satisfy this constraint, I need to either move yellow_box_1 to room_3 or be in front of green_ball_1.

Yellow_box_1 is in room_1 initially. So to move it to room_3, I would need to pick it up in room_1 and drop it in room_3. But first, I need to get to room_1 from room_3. Since yellow_door_1 is now unlocked, I can go through it.

So from room_3:

10. gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_1 (now in room_1)
11. In room_1, there's purple_box_1, yellow_box_1, green_box_1. Need to pick up yellow_box_1.

But to pick it up, I need to be in front of it. So:

12. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_1
13. pick yellow_box_1 room_1 (now holding it)
14. Then go back to room_3 via yellow_door_1:

    gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3
    gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1
15. drop yellow_box_1 room_3 (now yellow_box_1 is in room_3, satisfying constraint 2)

Alternatively, instead of moving yellow_box_1, maybe I can go to green_ball_1 in room_4. Since green_ball_1 is in room_4, I can go to room_4 again. But how?

Wait, after dropping yellow_box_2 in room_3, I'm in room_3. To get to room_4 again, I need to go through purple_door_2 (already unlocked). So:

From room_3:

15. gotodoor purple_door_2 room_3 room_4
16. gotoroom room_3 room_4 purple_door_2 (now in room_4)
17. gotoobject green_ball_1 room_4 (now in front of it, which satisfies constraint 2)

So this would satisfy constraint 2 (being in front of green_ball_1).

So which path is shorter? Let's see.

Alternatively, if I can satisfy constraint 2 by being in front of green_ball_1, I don't need to move yellow_box_1. Let's see.

So after unlocking yellow_door_1 (step 9), maybe I can go back to room_4 via purple_door_2 (already unlocked) and then goto green_ball_1.

But let's trace the steps again.

After step 7: yellow_box_2 is in room_3.

Then step 8: gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1

step 9: toggle yellow_door_1 (unlocked)

Now, to satisfy constraint 2, I can either:

Option A: move yellow_box_1 to room_3 (requires going to room_1, pick it up, return to room_3, drop it).

Option B: go to green_ball_1 in room_4 and be in front of it.

Option B might be shorter.

So from room_3, after unlocking yellow_door_1 (step 9), perhaps:

10. gotodoor purple_door_2 room_3 room_4 (already unlocked)

11. gotoroom room_3 room_4 purple_door_2 (now in room_4)

12. gotoobject green_ball_1 room_4 (now in front of it, which satisfies constraint 2)

Then, after that, need to get back to the yellow_ball_1 in room_2. But the goal is to be in front of a yellow ball, which is in room_2. So I need to return to room_2.

But how?

From room_4, the doors are grey_door_1 (to room_2) and purple_door_2 (to room_3). Grey_door_1 was unlocked earlier.

So from room_4:

13. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_2

14. toggle grey_door_1 (to unlock? Wait, initially we toggled it to unlock when moving from room_2 to room_4. So if we unlocked it once, it's now unlocked. Wait, the toggle action toggles the state. So if it was locked, toggle makes it unlocked. Then if you toggle again, it locks again.

But in our initial plan, when moving from room_2 to room_4, we toggled grey_door_1 (step 2: toggle grey_door_1, which was locked, so it becomes unlocked). Then we used gotoroom to go to room_4. So grey_door_1 is now unlocked. So when returning from room_4 to room_2, we can use it without toggling again.

So from room_4:

13. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_2

14. gotoroom room_4 room_2 grey_door_1 (now back in room_2)

Now, in room_2, the yellow_ball_1 is here. So:

15. gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2

16. Now, the goal is to be in front of a yellow ball. So this step satisfies the goal.

But need to check if all constraints are met.

Let's check each constraint:

1. yellow_door_1 is not locked in at least one state. When we toggled it in step 9, it became unlocked. So yes.

2. Either yellow_box_1 in room_3 or in front of green_ball_1. We went to green_ball_1 in step 12, so that's satisfied.

3. Holding some object or in front of yellow_door_1. When we picked up yellow_box_2 in step 5, we were holding it, so that satisfies constraint 3. Also, when we were in front of yellow_door_1 during step 8, that would also satisfy it. But the constraint needs to hold in at least one state. So step 5 satisfies.

4. yellow_box_2 in room_3. After step 7, yes.

5. Be in room_3. Steps 6 (gotoroom to room_3) and others.

6. Be in room_4. Steps 3 and 11.

So all constraints are met.

Now, let's check the plan steps and see if they form a valid sequence. Let's list all actions step by step:

1. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_4
2. toggle grey_door_1
3. gotoroom room_2 room_4 grey_door_1
4. gotoobject yellow_box_2 room_4
5. pick yellow_box_2 room_4
6. gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_3
7. toggle purple_door_2
8. gotoroom room_4 room_3 purple_door_2
9. drop yellow_box_2 room_3
10. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1
11. toggle yellow_door_1
12. gotodoor purple_door_2 room_3 room_4
13. gotoroom room_3 room_4 purple_door_2
14. gotoobject green_ball_1 room_4
15. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_2
16. gotoroom room_4 room_2 grey_door_1
17. gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2

Wait, step 9: after dropping yellow_box_2 in room_3, we need to proceed to unlock yellow_door_1.

Wait, after step 8: gotoroom to room_3. Then step 9: drop yellow_box_2. Then step 10: gotodoor yellow_door_1 in room_3. Then toggle it. Then steps to go to room_4.

But perhaps some steps can be optimized. Let me check:

Wait, after step 8: in room_3, we need to drop yellow_box_2. So:

Step 8: gotoroom room_4 room_3 purple_door_2 (now in room_3)

Step 9: drop yellow_box_2 room_3 (since we were holding it from step 5)

Then step 10: gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1

Step 11: toggle yellow_door_1 (now unlocked)

Then, to go to room_4 via purple_door_2:

Step 12: gotodoor purple_door_2 room_3 room_4

Step 13: gotoroom room_3 room_4 purple_door_2 (now in room_4)

Step 14: gotoobject green_ball_1 room_4 (satisfies constraint 2)

Then back to room_2 via grey_door_1.

But perhaps there's a shorter path. Let me check again.

Wait, maybe after dropping yellow_box_2 in room_3, we can go directly to room_1 via yellow_door_1 (now unlocked) to get yellow_box_1, but maybe that's not necessary if we can satisfy constraint 2 via green_ball_1.

Alternatively, maybe the steps can be arranged to minimize backtracking.

Another approach: After step 9 (drop yellow_box_2 in room_3), instead of going to room_4, perhaps we can go to room_1 and handle yellow_box_1, but that might add more steps. However, the current plan already satisfies constraint 2 via green_ball_1.

So the current steps are:

1. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_4
2. toggle grey_door_1
3. gotoroom room_2 room_4 grey_door_1
4. gotoobject yellow_box_2 room_4
5. pick yellow_box_2 room_4
6. gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_3
7. toggle purple_door_2
8. gotoroom room_4 room_3 purple_door_2
9. drop yellow_box_2 room_3
10. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1
11. toggle yellow_door_1
12. gotodoor purple_door_2 room_3 room_4
13. gotoroom room_3 room_4 purple_door_2
14. gotoobject green_ball_1 room_4
15. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_2
16. gotoroom room_4 room_2 grey_door_1
17. gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2

But wait, after step 13, you're in room_4 again. Then step 14: goto green_ball_1. Then step 15: go to grey_door_1 in room_4. Then step 16: go back to room_2. Then step 17: goto yellow_ball_1 in room_2.

This would achieve the goal. Now, check if all actions' preconditions are met.

Let's check each action:

1. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_4: Preconditions: in room_2 (yes), which is connected via grey_door_1. No object blocking. Valid.

2. toggle grey_door_1: Must be in front of it. After step 1, you are in front of grey_door_1. So valid.

3. gotoroom room_2 room_4 grey_door_1: Door is now unlocked. Valid.

4. gotoobject yellow_box_2 room_4: Now in room_4. Valid.

5. pick yellow_box_2 room_4: In room_4, not holding anything. Valid.

6. gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_3: In room_4, which is connected via purple_door_2. No blocking. Valid.

7. toggle purple_door_2: In front of it. Valid.

8. gotoroom room_4 room_3 purple_door_2: Door is unlocked. Valid.

9. drop yellow_box_2 room_3: Holding it, in room_3. Need to be in front of an empty spot. After gotoroom, you are not in front of anything. So need to gotoempty or gotoobject first. Wait, after step 8, you are in room_3 but not in front of any object. So to drop, you need to be in front of an empty spot. So after entering room_3, you are not in front of any object. So to drop, you need to perform 'gotoempty' first, then drop.

Wait, here's a problem. The drop action requires that you are in front of an empty position. Because when you drop, you place the object in front of you. So after moving to room_3 via gotoroom, you are not in front of any object. But to drop, you need to be in front of an empty position. But the 'drop' action's precondition is: (i) holding the object, (ii) the position in front of you is empty. But when you move to a room via gotoroom, you are no longer in front of anything. So the position in front of you is empty. So can you drop immediately?

Wait, the effect of gotoroom is that you are no longer in front of any object or door. So when you arrive in room_3, you're not in front of anything, which means the position you're facing is empty. So you can drop the object there. So step 9: drop yellow_box_2 room_3 is possible.

Yes, because after gotoroom, you are not in front of anything, which implies the spot in front is empty. So the drop is allowed.

Proceeding:

10. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1: In room_3, which is connected via yellow_door_1. No blocking. Valid.

11. toggle yellow_door_1: In front of it. Valid.

12. gotodoor purple_door_2 room_3 room_4: In room_3. Valid.

13. gotoroom room_3 room_4 purple_door_2: Door is unlocked. Valid.

14. gotoobject green_ball_1 room_4: In room_4, green_ball_1 is there. Valid.

15. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_2: In room_4, connected via grey_door_1. Valid.

16. gotoroom room_4 room_2 grey_door_1: Door is unlocked. Valid.

17. gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2: In room_2, yellow_ball_1 is there. Valid.

Now, this plan seems to work. But let's check the constraints again:

Constraint 3: At some state, holding an object or in front of yellow_door_1. When we pick up yellow_box_2 (step 5), we are holding it, so that's one state where constraint 3 is satisfied. Also, when we are in front of yellow_door_1 (steps 10 and 11), but after toggling, perhaps the door is now unlocked. So step 10: gotodoor yellow_door_1, then step 11: toggle. So during step 10, we are in front of yellow_door_1. So that's another state satisfying constraint 3. But since the constraint is to have at least one state where either holds, the holding in step 5 suffices.

All other constraints are covered.

Now, is this the shortest possible plan? Let's see if any steps can be optimized.

For example, after dropping yellow_box_2 in room_3 (step 9), instead of going to yellow_door_1, maybe we can go directly to purple_door_2 to room_4. But we need to unlock yellow_door_1 to satisfy constraint 1. So that step is necessary.

Another possible optimization: After unlocking yellow_door_1 (step 11), do we need to go to room_4 again? Because we could go from room_3 to room_1 via yellow_door_1, but that might not be necessary. However, in the current plan, we go back to room_4 to satisfy constraint 2 (being in front of green_ball_1). Alternatively, if we could satisfy constraint 2 by moving yellow_box_1 to room_3, but that requires more steps.

Alternatively, perhaps after step 11, instead of going to room_4, we can go to room_1, pick up yellow_box_1, and drop it in room_3. Then that satisfies constraint 2. Let's see:

After step 11 (toggle yellow_door_1), we are in front of yellow_door_1 in room_3.

12. gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_1 (now in room_1)

13. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_1

14. pick yellow_box_1 room_1

15. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3

16. gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1 (now in room_3)

17. drop yellow_box_1 room_3 (now yellow_box_1 is in room_3, satisfying constraint 2)

Then, proceed to room_4:

18. gotodoor purple_door_2 room_3 room_4

19. gotoroom room_3 room_4 purple_door_2 (now in room_4)

20. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_2

21. gotoroom room_4 room_2 grey_door_1

22. gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2

But this adds more steps. The original plan has 17 steps, while this alternative would have 22. So the original plan is shorter.

Therefore, the initial plan is better.

But let's count the steps again in the original plan:

1. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_4

2. toggle grey_door_1

3. gotoroom room_2 room_4 grey_door_1

4. gotoobject yellow_box_2 room_4

5. pick yellow_box_2 room_4

6. gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_3

7. toggle purple_door_2

8. gotoroom room_4 room_3 purple_door_2

9. drop yellow_box_2 room_3

10. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1

11. toggle yellow_door_1

12. gotodoor purple_door_2 room_3 room_4

13. gotoroom room_3 room_4 purple_door_2

14. gotoobject green_ball_1 room_4

15. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_2

16. gotoroom room_4 room_2 grey_door_1

17. gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2

That's 17 actions. Can we find a shorter plan?

Maybe by combining some steps. For example, after dropping yellow_box_2 in room_3 (step 9), instead of going to yellow_door_1, perhaps we can directly go to room_4 and then go to green_ball_1. But we need to unlock yellow_door_1 to satisfy constraint 1.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a way to unlock yellow_door_1 earlier. But how?

Wait, initially, all doors are locked. To unlock yellow_door_1, I need to be in room_3 or room_1. But initially, I'm in room_2, which is connected to room_1 via purple_door_1. If I can unlock purple_door_1, I can go to room_1, then to room_3 via yellow_door_1. But purple_door_1 is locked. So perhaps:

Alternative plan:

1. Unlock purple_door_1 (room_2 to room_1)

But let's see:

Starting in room_2:

1. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1

2. toggle purple_door_1 (unlocks it)

3. gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1 (now in room_1)

Then in room_1, unlock yellow_door_1:

4. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3

5. toggle yellow_door_1 (unlocks it)

6. gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1 (now in room_3)

Then in room_3, unlock purple_door_2 (connects to room_4):

7. gotodoor purple_door_2 room_3 room_4

8. toggle purple_door_2 (unlocks it)

9. gotoroom room_3 room_4 purple_door_2 (now in room_4)

Then pick up yellow_box_2 and move it to room_3:

10. gotoobject yellow_box_2 room_4

11. pick yellow_box_2 room_4

12. gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_3

13. gotoroom room_4 room_3 purple_door_2

14. drop yellow_box_2 room_3 (now constraint 4 is satisfied)

Then go to room_4 again:

15. gotodoor purple_door_2 room_3 room_4

16. gotoroom room_3 room_4 purple_door_2

17. gotoobject green_ball_1 room_4 (constraint 2)

Then go back to room_2 via grey_door_1. But grey_door_1 is still locked. Because in this alternative plan, we didn't unlock grey_door_1. So we need to unlock it.

So from room_4:

18. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_2

19. toggle grey_door_1 (unlocks it)

20. gotoroom room_4 room_2 grey_door_1

21. gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2

This is 21 steps, which is longer than the previous plan. So the original plan is better.

Therefore, the initial plan with 17 steps seems to be the shortest. However, perhaps there's a way to reduce steps by reordering.

Wait, in the original plan, after step 13 (gotoroom room_3 room_4 purple_door_2), you are in room_4. Then step 14: gotoobject green_ball_1. Then step 15: gotodoor grey_door_1, then step 16: gotoroom to room_2. Then step 17: gotoobject yellow_ball_1.

But can we combine some steps? For example, after dropping yellow_box_2 in room_3 (step 9), instead of going to yellow_door_1, maybe we can go directly to room_4 and then to green_ball_1. But we need to unlock yellow_door_1. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps when we are in room_3 after dropping yellow_box_2, we can go to yellow_door_1, unlock it (step 10 and 11), then go to room_1, then back to room_3, then to room_4. But this seems to add steps.

Alternatively, after unlocking yellow_door_1, can we go directly to room_1, then to room_2 via purple_door_1 (if it's unlocked), but in the original plan, purple_door_1 was not unlocked. Because in the first steps, we used grey_door_1 to go to room_4.

So perhaps the initial plan is the shortest possible.

Now, let's verify if all the constraints are met in the original plan:

1. yellow_door_1 is not locked: yes, after step 11.

2. yellow_box_1 in room_3 or in front of green_ball_1: yes, step 14.

3. holding an object or in front of yellow_door_1: step 5 (holding) and step 10 (in front of yellow_door_1).

4. yellow_box_2 in room_3: yes, after step 9.

5. be in room_3: steps 8, 9, etc.

6. be in room_4: steps 3, 13, etc.

All constraints are satisfied.

The final goal is to be in front of a yellow ball. The yellow_ball_1 is in room_2, and in step 17, we are in front of it. So the goal is achieved.

Thus, the plan is valid and meets all constraints. Now, I need to present the plan in the correct format.
