Let's break down the problem:

1. We need to navigate a 2D gridworld with 4 rooms arranged in a square formation.
2. There are doors connecting certain room pairs, and each door, box, and ball has a color.
3. We need to provide a valid sequence of actions to satisfy a goal and constraints.

Let me analyze the initial state and the goal:

**Initial State:**
- We are in room_2.
- purple_box_1, yellow_box_1, green_box_1 are in room_1.
- yellow_ball_1 is in room_2.
- blue_box_1, green_box_2 are in room_3.
- yellow_box_2, green_ball_1 are in room_4.
- All doors are locked.
- We are not holding any object.

**Goal:**
- We need to be in front of a yellow ball (which is yellow_ball_1).

**Constraints:**
1. At some point, yellow_door_1 is not locked.
2. At some point, either yellow_box_1 is in room_3 OR we are in front of green_ball_1.
3. At some point, either we are holding some object OR we are in front of yellow_door_1.
4. At some point, yellow_box_2 is in room_3.
5. At some point, we are in room_3.
6. At some point, we are in room_4.

Now, let me plan how to achieve the goal while satisfying the constraints:

First, note that our goal is to be in front of yellow_ball_1, which is already in room_2, and we start in room_2. So we just need to go in front of it.

However, we need to satisfy the constraints as well. Let's address them one by one:

1. For yellow_door_1 to be unlocked, we need to go to yellow_door_1 and toggle it.
2. For yellow_box_1 to be in room_3, we need to pick it up from room_1 and drop it in room_3. Alternatively, we need to go in front of green_ball_1, which is in room_4.
3. We will be holding an object at some point OR we will be in front of yellow_door_1. We are already planning to be in front of yellow_door_1, so we satisfy this.
4. For yellow_box_2, we need to move it from room_4 to room_3.
5. We will be visiting room_3 to satisfy other constraints.
6. We will be visiting room_4 as well.

Now, let's plan the sequence of actions to achieve all of this:

Given the initial state, we are in room_2. 

First, let's focus on moving to room_1, room_3, and room_4 to ensure we visit all rooms:
1. We need to go to the door connecting room_2 and room_1 (purple_door_1).
2. Toggle the door to unlock it.
3. Go to room_1.
4. Go to the door connecting room_1 and room_3 (yellow_door_1).
5. Toggle the door to unlock it. This satisfies constraint 1 and also helps with constraint 3.
6. Go to room_3. This satisfies constraint 5.
7. Go to the door connecting room_3 and room_4 (purple_door_2).
8. Toggle the door to unlock it.
9. Go to room_4. This satisfies constraint 6.

Now, let's look at constraint 2. We need either yellow_box_1 to be in room_3 OR to be in front of green_ball_1. For now, let's go with being in front of green_ball_1 since it's simpler:
10. While in room_4, go in front of green_ball_1. This satisfies constraint 2.

Next, for constraint 4, we need to move yellow_box_2 from room_4 to room_3:
11. Go in front of yellow_box_2.
12. Pick up yellow_box_2.
13. Go to the door connecting room_4 and room_3 (purple_door_2).
14. Go to room_3.
15. Drop yellow_box_2 in room_3. This satisfies constraint 4.

Finally, we need to achieve our goal, which is to go in front of yellow_ball_1 in room_2:
16. Go to the door connecting room_3 and room_1 (yellow_door_1).
17. Go to room_1.
18. Go to the door connecting room_1 and room_2 (purple_door_1).
19. Go to room_2.
20. Go in front of yellow_ball_1. This achieves the goal.

Let's double-check:
- We are in front of yellow_ball_1, which is yellow and a ball. This satisfies the goal.
- We have unlocked yellow_door_1 (constraint 1).
- We have been in front of green_ball_1 (constraint 2).
- We have been in front of yellow_door_1 (constraint 3).
- We have moved yellow_box_2 to room_3 (constraint 4).
- We have visited room_3 (constraint 5).
- We have visited room_4 (constraint 6).

Wait, let me double-check the constraint 2. It says:
"The following expression must hold in at least one state: "At least one of the following conditions is true: "yellow_box_1 is in room_3", "you are in front of green_ball_1"""

So either yellow_box_1 is in room_3 OR we are in front of green_ball_1. In our plan, we chose to go in front of green_ball_1. This should be fine.

However, let's also double-check if our plan is valid. Specifically, let's check the preconditions of each action:

1. "gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1": We are in room_2 which is connected to room_1 via purple_door_1. This checks out.
2. "toggle purple_door_1": We are in front of purple_door_1. This checks out.
3. "gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1": We are in room_2, purple_door_1 connects room_2 and room_1, and purple_door_1 is unlocked. This checks out.
4. "gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3": We are in room_1 which is connected to room_3 via yellow_door_1. This checks out.
5. "toggle yellow_door_1": We are in front of yellow_door_1. This checks out.
6. "gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1": We are in room_1, yellow_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3, and yellow_door_1 is unlocked. This checks out.
7. "gotodoor purple_door_2 room_3 room_4": We are in room_3 which is connected to room_4 via purple_door_2. This checks out.
8. "toggle purple_door_2": We are in front of purple_door_2. This checks out.
9. "gotoroom room_3 room_4 purple_door_2": We are in room_3, purple_door_2 connects room_3 and room_4, and purple_door_2 is unlocked. This checks out.
10. "gotoobject green_ball_1 room_4": We are in room_4 where green_ball_1 is. This checks out.
11. "gotoobject yellow_box_2 room_4": We are in room_4 where yellow_box_2 is. This checks out.
12. "pick yellow_box_2 room_4": We are in front of yellow_box_2 and our hands are empty. This checks out.
13. "gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_3": We are in room_4 which is connected to room_3 via purple_door_2, and we're holding yellow_box_2 (which is fine, as holding an object doesn't prevent movement). This checks out.
14. "gotoroom room_4 room_3 purple_door_2": We are in room_4, purple_door_2 connects room_4 and room_3, and purple_door_2 is unlocked. This checks out.
15. "gotoempty": We want to go to an empty position in room_3. This checks out.
16. "drop yellow_box_2 room_3": We are in front of an empty position, are in room_3, and are holding yellow_box_2. This checks out.
17. "gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1": We are in room_3 which is connected to room_1 via yellow_door_1. This checks out.
18. "gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_1": We are in room_3, yellow_door_1 connects room_3 and room_1, and yellow_door_1 is unlocked. This checks out.
19. "gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2": We are in room_1 which is connected to room_2 via purple_door_1. This checks out.
20. "gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1": We are in room_1, purple_door_1 connects room_1 and room_2, and purple_door_1 is unlocked. This checks out.
21. "gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2": We are in room_2 where yellow_ball_1 is. This checks out.

All the actions seem to check out. 

But wait, I think I might need to be more careful with the "gotoobject" and "drop" actions, as the problem statement says objects can block doors. Let me re-check this carefully.

The "gotoobject" action says you may only go in front of an object x if you are in the same room as x. There's no mention of objects blocking other objects, only doors. So our "gotoobject" actions should be fine.

For the "drop" action, it says, "you may only drop an object x if (i) you are currently holding x, and (ii) the position in front of you is empty." This seems fine too. But let's make sure that the "gotoempty" action before dropping yellow_box_2 in room_3 is valid.

The "gotoempty" action says, "you may go in front of an empty position anytime." This seems like there's no restriction, so our use of "gotoempty" should be fine.

So let me revise our plan, with slight reordering for clarity:

1. "gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1": We go to the door connecting room_2 and room_1.
2. "toggle purple_door_1": We unlock the door.
3. "gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1": We go to room_1.
4. "gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3": We go to the door connecting room_1 and room_3.
5. "toggle yellow_door_1": We unlock the door. This satisfies constraint 1 (yellow_door_1 is not locked) and also helps with constraint 3 (we are in front of yellow_door_1).
6. "gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1": We go to room_3. This satisfies constraint 5 (we are in room_3).
7. "gotodoor purple_door_2 room_3 room_4": We go to the door connecting room_3 and room_4.
8. "toggle purple_door_2": We unlock the door.
9. "gotoroom room_3 room_4 purple_door_2": We go to room_4. This satisfies constraint 6 (we are in room_4).
10. "gotoobject green_ball_1 room_4": We go in front of green_ball_1. This satisfies constraint 2 (we are in front of green_ball_1).
11. "gotoobject yellow_box_2 room_4": We go in front of yellow_box_2.
12. "pick yellow_box_2 room_4": We pick up yellow_box_2. This helps satisfy constraint 3 (we are holding some object).
13. "gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_3": We go to the door connecting room_4 and room_3.
14. "gotoroom room_4 room_3 purple_door_2": We go to room_3.
15. "gotoempty": We go to an empty position in room_3.
16. "drop yellow_box_2 room_3": We drop yellow_box_2 in room_3. This satisfies constraint 4 (yellow_box_2 is in room_3).
17. "gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1": We go to the door connecting room_3 and room_1.
18. "gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_1": We go to room_1.
19. "gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2": We go to the door connecting room_1 and room_2.
20. "gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1": We go to room_2.
21. "gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2": We go in front of yellow_ball_1. This achieves the goal.

Actually, wait! I just realized we need to be careful with the doors between rooms. We should ensure that we're specifying the right door for the right room pair. Let me re-check this.

Given the initial state:
- "room_2 and room_1 are connected via purple_door_1"
- "room_1 and room_2 are connected via purple_door_1"
- "room_3 and room_1 are connected via yellow_door_1"
- "room_1 and room_3 are connected via yellow_door_1"
- "room_4 and room_2 are connected via grey_door_1"
- "room_2 and room_4 are connected via grey_door_1"
- "room_4 and room_3 are connected via purple_door_2"
- "room_3 and room_4 are connected via purple_door_2"

Actually I do see I always got the door-room mappings correct. So my revised plan should be correct.

However, now I think that I used "gotodoor" incorrectly.

Let me look at the "gotodoor" action again:
"gotodoor d r1 r2": Go in front of door d, connecting room r1 to room r2.

So I shouldn't say "gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1" since we are already in room_2. Rather, I should say "gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1".

Let me recheck my steps with that change:

1. "gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1": We go to the door connecting room_2 and room_1. Correct.
2. "toggle purple_door_1": We unlock the door. Correct.
3. "gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1": We go to room_1. Correct.
4. "gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3": We go to the door connecting room_1 and room_3. Correct.
5. "toggle yellow_door_1": We unlock the door. Correct.
6. "gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1": We go to room_3. Correct.
7. "gotodoor purple_door_2 room_3 room_4": We go to the door connecting room_3 and room_4. Correct.
8. "toggle purple_door_2": We unlock the door. Correct.
9. "gotoroom room_3 room_4 purple_door_2": We go to room_4. Correct.
10. "gotoobject green_ball_1 room_4": We go in front of green_ball_1. Correct.
11. "gotoobject yellow_box_2 room_4": We go in front of yellow_box_2. Correct.
12. "pick yellow_box_2 room_4": We pick up yellow_box_2. Correct.
13. "gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_3": We go to the door connecting room_4 and room_3. Correct.
14. "gotoroom room_4 room_3 purple_door_2": We go to room_3. Correct.
15. "gotoempty": We go to an empty position in room_3. Correct.
16. "drop yellow_box_2 room_3": We drop yellow_box_2 in room_3. Correct.
17. "gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1": We go to the door connecting room_3 and room_1. Correct.
18. "gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_1": We go to room_1. Correct.
19. "gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2": We go to the door connecting room_1 and room_2. Correct.
20. "gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1": We go to room_2. Correct.
21. "gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2": We go in front of yellow_ball_1. Correct.

Actually, now I notice that we've gone from room_2 to room_1 to room_3 to room_4, and then back to room_3, room_1, and finally room_2. I can check if we can optimize this to shorten the plan.

Actually, I think we can probably go directly from room_2 to room_4 via grey_door_1, which would save several steps. The problem mentions a grey_door_1 connecting room_2 and room_4, which I hadn't used in my plan.

Let me revise our plan:

1. "gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_4": We go to the door connecting room_2 and room_4.
2. "toggle grey_door_1": We unlock the door.
3. "gotoroom room_2 room_4 grey_door_1": We go to room_4. This satisfies constraint 6 (we are in room_4).
4. "gotoobject green_ball_1 room_4": We go in front of green_ball_1. This satisfies constraint 2 (we are in front of green_ball_1).
5. "gotoobject yellow_box_2 room_4": We go in front of yellow_box_2.
6. "pick yellow_box_2 room_4": We pick up yellow_box_2. This helps satisfy constraint 3 (we are holding some object).
7. "gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_3": We go to the door connecting room_4 and room_3.
8. "toggle purple_door_2": We unlock the door.
9. "gotoroom room_4 room_3 purple_door_2": We go to room_3. This satisfies constraint 5 (we are in room_3).
10. "gotoempty": We go to an empty position in room_3.
11. "drop yellow_box_2 room_3": We drop yellow_box_2 in room_3. This satisfies constraint 4 (yellow_box_2 is in room_3).
12. "gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1": We go to the door connecting room_3 and room_1.
13. "toggle yellow_door_1": We unlock the door. This satisfies constraint 1 (yellow_door_1 is not locked) and also helps with constraint 3 (we are in front of yellow_door_1).
14. "gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_1": We go to room_1.
15. "gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2": We go to the door connecting room_1 and room_2.
16. "toggle purple_door_1": We unlock the door.
17. "gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1": We go to room_2.
18. "gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2": We go in front of yellow_ball_1. This achieves the goal.

This plan has 18 actions, which is shorter than our previous one. Let's double-check that it's valid:

- We are in front of yellow_ball_1, which is yellow and a ball. This satisfies the goal.
- We have unlocked yellow_door_1 (constraint 1).
- We have been in front of green_ball_1 (constraint 2).
- We have held an object (yellow_box_2) and have been in front of yellow_door_1 (constraint 3).
- We have moved yellow_box_2 to room_3 (constraint 4).
- We have visited room_3 (constraint 5).
- We have visited room_4 (constraint 6).

This plan also satisfies all the constraints correctly.

Wait, hold on. I just realized that we also need to make sure that the plan is optimal, i.e., it has the shortest possible length. Let me think about whether we can optimize this further.

From room_2, we can go directly to room_4, then to room_3, then back to room_2. But the goal is to be in front of yellow_ball_1, which is already in room_2. So actually, there's an even shorter plan:

1. "gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2": We go in front of yellow_ball_1. This partially achieves the goal.
2. "gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_4": We go to the door connecting room_2 and room_4.
3. "toggle grey_door_1": We unlock the door.
4. "gotoroom room_2 room_4 grey_door_1": We go to room_4. This satisfies constraint 6 (we are in room_4).
5. "gotoobject green_ball_1 room_4": We go in front of green_ball_1. This satisfies constraint 2 (we are in front of green_ball_1).
6. "gotoobject yellow_box_2 room_4": We go in front of yellow_box_2.
7. "pick yellow_box_2 room_4": We pick up yellow_box_2. This helps satisfy constraint 3 (we are holding some object).
8. "gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_3": We go to the door connecting room_4 and room_3.
9. "toggle purple_door_2": We unlock the door.
10. "gotoroom room_4 room_3 purple_door_2": We go to room_3. This satisfies constraint 5 (we are in room_3).
11. "gotoempty": We go to an empty position in room_3.
12. "drop yellow_box_2 room_3": We drop yellow_box_2 in room_3. This satisfies constraint 4 (yellow_box_2 is in room_3).
13. "gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1": We go to the door connecting room_3 and room_1.
14. "toggle yellow_door_1": We unlock the door. This satisfies constraint 1 (yellow_door_1 is not locked) and constraint 3 (we are in front of yellow_door_1).
15. "gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_1": We go to room_1.
16. "gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2": We go to the door connecting room_1 and room_2.
17. "toggle purple_door_1": We unlock the door.
18. "gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1": We go to room_2.
19. "gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2": We go in front of yellow_ball_1. This achieves the goal.

Wait, this is actually not shorter. Looking at it, this plan has 19 actions, and the previous one had 18. Let's see if I can find an even shorter path.

Actually, let me first make a note that I can't end my plan with just going in front of yellow_ball_1, because the goal was to be in front of a yellow ball, and it needs to be fully achieved by the end of the plan. So my first attempted optimization doesn't work.

Let's see if there's a different way to reduce the number of steps.

Wait, I think I was wrong about the need to visit all those rooms. Let's look at the constraints again:

1. At some point, yellow_door_1 is not locked.
2. At some point, either yellow_box_1 is in room_3 OR we are in front of green_ball_1.
3. At some point, either we are holding some object OR we are in front of yellow_door_1.
4. At some point, yellow_box_2 is in room_3.
5. At some point, we are in room_3.
6. At some point, we are in room_4.

For constraint 1, we need to unlock yellow_door_1, which connects room_1 and room_3. For constraint 2, we chose to go in front of green_ball_1, which is in room_4. For constraint 3, we chose to both hold an object and go in front of yellow_door_1. For constraint 4, we moved yellow_box_2 from room_4 to room_3.

Let's think about an alternate plan:

For constraint 2, we have two options: either yellow_box_1 is in room_3 OR we are in front of green_ball_1. The first option would involve moving yellow_box_1 from room_1 to room_3, which would require multiple steps (picking up yellow_box_1 in room_1, moving to room_3, dropping it). The second option only requires us to go in front of green_ball_1 in room_4, which likely takes fewer steps. 

For constraint 3, we have two options as well: either we are holding some object OR we are in front of yellow_door_1. Going in front of yellow_door_1 is something we'd likely do anyway for constraint 1. 

For constraint 4, we need to move yellow_box_2 from room_4 to room_3. This requires multiple steps: going to room_4, picking up yellow_box_2, going to room_3, and dropping it. We can't avoid this.

For constraints 5 and 6, we need to visit room_3 and room_4 at some point, which is also required for our other constraints.

But for the goal, we need to be in front of yellow_ball_1, which is already in room_2 where we start. So, ideally, we want to minimize the steps we take away from room_2, fulfill all the constraints, and then return to room_2 to achieve the goal.

Let's think about this step by step:

1. From room_2, we can go to room_1 via purple_door_1 or to room_4 via grey_door_1.
2. From room_1, we can go to room_3 via yellow_door_1.
3. From room_3, we can go to room_4 via purple_door_2.
4. From room_4, we can go to room_2 via grey_door_1 or to room_3 via purple_door_2.

To minimize the path, we should avoid revisiting rooms when possible.

Let's try this plan:

1. "gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_4": We go to the door connecting room_2 and room_4.
2. "toggle grey_door_1": We unlock the door.
3. "gotoroom room_2 room_4 grey_door_1": We go to room_4. This satisfies constraint 6 (we are in room_4).
4. "gotoobject green_ball_1 room_4": We go in front of green_ball_1. This satisfies constraint 2 (we are in front of green_ball_1).
5. "gotoobject yellow_box_2 room_4": We go in front of yellow_box_2.
6. "pick yellow_box_2 room_4": We pick up yellow_box_2. This helps satisfy constraint 3 (we are holding some object).
7. "gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_3": We go to the door connecting room_4 and room_3.
8. "toggle purple_door_2": We unlock the door.
9. "gotoroom room_4 room_3 purple_door_2": We go to room_3. This satisfies constraint 5 (we are in room_3).
10. "gotoempty": We go to an empty position in room_3.
11. "drop yellow_box_2 room_3": We drop yellow_box_2 in room_3. This satisfies constraint 4 (yellow_box_2 is in room_3).
12. "gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1": We go to the door connecting room_3 and room_1.
13. "toggle yellow_door_1": We unlock the door. This satisfies constraint 1 (yellow_door_1 is not locked) and constraint 3 (we are in front of yellow_door_1).
14. "gotodoor purple_door_2 room_3 room_4": We go to the door connecting room_3 and room_4.
15. "gotoroom room_3 room_4 purple_door_2": We go back to room_4.
16. "gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_2": We go to the door connecting room_4 and room_2.
17. "gotoroom room_4 room_2 grey_door_1": We go back to room_2.
18. "gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2": We go in front of yellow_ball_1. This achieves the goal.

This plan has 18 actions, and it fulfills all our constraints and achieves the goal. But it's the same length as one of our previous plans.

Let's trying removing an action and see if there's an optimization we missed:

In our plan:
1. We go to room_4. 
2. We go in front of green_ball_1. (constraint 2)
3. We go in front of, pick up, and later drop yellow_box_2. (constraints 3 and 4)
4. We go to room_3. (constraint 5)
5. We unlock yellow_door_1. (constraint 1)
6. We return to room_2.
7. We go in front of yellow_ball_1.

Are there any steps we can remove or combine? Let's see...

Hmm, I don't see an obvious optimization. The plan seems pretty tight, and all the actions are necessary to fulfill the constraints and achieve the goal.

Let me review the plan one more time to make sure it's correct:

1. "gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_4": Go to the door in room_2 that connects to room_4.
2. "toggle grey_door_1": Unlock grey_door_1.
3. "gotoroom room_2 room_4 grey_door_1": Move from room_2 to room_4.
4. "gotoobject green_ball_1 room_4": Go in front of green_ball_1.
5. "gotoobject yellow_box_2 room_4": Go in front of yellow_box_2.
6. "pick yellow_box_2 room_4": Pick up yellow_box_2.
7. "gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_3": Go to the door in room_4 that connects to room_3.
8. "toggle purple_door_2": Unlock purple_door_2.
9. "gotoroom room_4 room_3 purple_door_2": Move from room_4 to room_3.
10. "gotoempty": Go to an empty position in room_3.
11. "drop yellow_box_2 room_3": Drop yellow_box_2.
12. "gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1": Go to the door in room_3 that connects to room_1.
13. "toggle yellow_door_1": Unlock yellow_door_1.
14. "gotodoor purple_door_2 room_3 room_4": Go to the door in room_3 that connects to room_4.
15. "gotoroom room_3 room_4 purple_door_2": Move from room_3 to room_4.
16. "gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_2": Go to the door in room_4 that connects to room_2.
17. "gotoroom room_4 room_2 grey_door_1": Move from room_4 to room_2.
18. "gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2": Go in front of yellow_ball_1.

I think that's correct, and it's also optimal.

Let me just do sanity checks and see if all constraints are satisfied, and whether the goal state is reached at the end:

Constraint 1: At some point, yellow_door_1 is not locked. 
- This is satisfied at step 13 after we toggle yellow_door_1.

Constraint 2: At some point, either yellow_box_1 is in room_3, or we are in front of green_ball_1. 
- This is satisfied at step 4 when we go in front of green_ball_1.

Constraint 3: At some point, either we are holding some object, or we are in front of yellow_door_1. 
- This is satisfied at step 6 when we pick up yellow_box_2, and again at step 12 when we go in front of yellow_door_1.

Constraint 4: At some point, yellow_box_2 is in room_3. 
- This is satisfied at step 11 after we drop yellow_box_2 in room_3.

Constraint 5: At some point, we are in room_3. 
- This is satisfied at step 9 after we move from room_4 to room_3.

Constraint 6: At some point, we are in room_4. 
- This is satisfied at step 3 after we move from room_2 to room_4.

Goal: There is a ball v such that "The following conditions are all true: "v is yellow", "you are in front of v". 
- This is satisfied at step 18 after we go in front of yellow_ball_1, which is a yellow ball.

All checks pass. Our plan achieves the goal and satisfies all the constraints.

Here is the final plan:

```
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_4
toggle grey_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_4 grey_door_1
gotoobject green_ball_1 room_4
gotoobject yellow_box_2 room_4
pick yellow_box_2 room_4
gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_3
toggle purple_door_2
gotoroom room_4 room_3 purple_door_2
gotoempty
drop yellow_box_2 room_3
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1
toggle yellow_door_1
gotodoor purple_door_2 room_3 room_4
gotoroom room_3 room_4 purple_door_2
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_2
gotoroom room_4 room_2 grey_door_1
gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2
