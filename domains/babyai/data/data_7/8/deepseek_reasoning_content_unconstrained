Okay, let's see. I need to figure out how to get the agent to be in front of a yellow ball. The initial state says the agent is in room_2, and the yellow_ball_1 is in room_2. So maybe the simplest way is to go to that ball and be in front of it. But wait, the problem mentions constraints. Let me check the constraints again. Oh, the user didn't list any specific constraints here beyond the usual action preconditions. Wait, the original problem statement says "a set of constraints" but in the provided input, the constraints section is empty. Hmm. So maybe there are no additional constraints beyond the action rules.

So the goal is to have the agent in front of a yellow ball. The yellow_ball_1 is in room_2 initially. The agent is also in room_2. So the steps would be: go to the yellow_ball_1 in room_2, then pick it? Wait, no. The goal is just to be in front of it. So maybe the agent just needs to perform "gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2". But let's check the preconditions for "gotoobject". The precondition is that the agent is in the same room as the object. Since the agent starts in room_2, and the ball is in room_2, that's okay. So the action "gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2" should work. But wait, what's the initial state of the agent's position? The problem states that the agent is in room_2 but doesn't mention being in front of any object. So initially, the agent isn't in front of anything. So performing "gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2" would make them in front of it. Then that's the plan. But is there any obstacle? Like doors being locked. Wait, the doors are locked. But the agent doesn't need to move through doors because they're already in room_2. So the steps are straightforward. But wait, the initial state says all doors are locked. But the "gotoobject" action doesn't require the door to be unlocked unless the agent is moving through it. Since the agent is already in the correct room, they can just perform the gotoobject action. So the plan would be just one action: gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2. But let me double-check.

Wait, the "gotoobject" preconditions: you can only go in front of an object x if you are in the same room as x. Yes, agent is in room_2, object is in room_2. So yes. So the action is valid. Then the plan is just that single action. But wait, the problem says the agent has to bring about the goal situation. So the goal is "there is a ball v such that v is yellow and you are in front of v". Since the yellow_ball_1 is already in room_2, the agent just needs to go in front of it. So the plan is simply:

gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2

But let me check if any doors need to be unlocked. For example, if the agent was in another room, they'd have to go through doors. But here, since they are already in room_2 where the yellow ball is, they don't need to move through any doors. So no unlocking is needed. So that action should suffice. Therefore, the optimal plan is one step.
