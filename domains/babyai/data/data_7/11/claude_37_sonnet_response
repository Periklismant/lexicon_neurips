Let me break down this planning problem to understand it better:

**Gridworld**: 4 rooms arranged in a square formation:
- room_1: north-west
- room_2: south-west
- room_3: north-east
- room_4: south-east

Doors connect the following room pairs:
- room_1-room_2 (yellow_door_1)
- room_1-room_3 (purple_door_1)
- room_2-room_4 (green_door_1)
- room_3-room_4 (yellow_door_2)

**Initial State**:
- I am in room_2
- green_box_1 and yellow_ball_1 are in room_1
- purple_box_1 is in room_2
- blue_ball_1, green_box_2, and yellow_ball_2 are in room_3
- purple_box_2 and blue_box_1 are in room_4
- All doors are locked
- I am not holding any object
- I have visited room_2

**Goal**:
- I need to be in front of a blue ball (in this case, blue_ball_1)

**Constraints**:
1. purple_door_1 must always be locked
2. I must never enter room_1
3. I must visit room_3 at some point
4. Before I can visit room_3, I must have been in front of blue_box_1 or an empty position
5. I must visit room_2 at some point (already satisfied in the initial state)
6. After I visit room_2, I must be in front of yellow_ball_1 or holding blue_ball_1 either immediately or at a later state
7. I must be in front of purple_door_1 at some point
8. Before I can be in front of purple_door_1, I must have been in front of blue_box_1 or in room_4
9. I must hold some object at some point
10. At some point, either blue_box_1 must be in room_3 or I must be in front of yellow_ball_1

Now, let's think about how to solve this problem.

First, let me understand the spatial relationships:
- From room_2, I can go to room_1 (via yellow_door_1) or room_4 (via green_door_1)
- From room_1, I can go to room_2 (via yellow_door_1) or room_3 (via purple_door_1)
- From room_3, I can go to room_1 (via purple_door_1) or room_4 (via yellow_door_2)
- From room_4, I can go to room_2 (via green_door_1) or room_3 (via yellow_door_2)

However, based on constraint 2, I cannot enter room_1. This means I can't use yellow_door_1 or purple_door_1 to move between rooms.

Based on constraint 1, purple_door_1 must always be locked, which aligns with the restriction that I can't enter room_1.

The goal is to be in front of blue_ball_1, which is in room_3. Constraint 3 requires me to visit room_3, so I need to find a way to get there.

From my starting position in room_2, I can go to room_4 via green_door_1, but I need to unlock it first. From room_4, I can go to room_3 via yellow_door_2, but again, I need to unlock it first.

Constraint 4 states that before I can visit room_3, I must have been in front of blue_box_1 or an empty position. blue_box_1 is in room_4, so I might want to visit blue_box_1 first before going to room_3.

Given the constraints 7 and 8, I must be in front of purple_door_1 at some point, and before I can do that, I must have been in front of blue_box_1 or in room_4. purple_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3, so I'd need to be in one of these rooms to go in front of it. Since I can't enter room_1, I must access purple_door_1 from room_3. Before I can do that, I need to have been in front of blue_box_1 or in room_4.

For constraint 10, I need to ensure that either blue_box_1 is in room_3 or I'm in front of yellow_ball_1. Since yellow_ball_1 is in room_1 and I can't enter room_1, it seems I need to move blue_box_1 to room_3.

Let's plan out our actions:

1. I start in room_2 with purple_box_1.
2. I need to go to room_4 to find blue_box_1, but first, I need to unlock green_door_1.
3. I go in front of green_door_1 and unlock it.
4. I enter room_4.
5. I go in front of blue_box_1 (satisfying a precondition for constraint 8).
6. I pick up blue_box_1 (satisfying constraint 9).
7. I go in front of yellow_door_2 and unlock it.
8. I enter room_3, bringing blue_box_1 with me (satisfying constraint 10).
9. I drop blue_box_1 in room_3 (ensuring blue_box_1 is in room_3 for constraint 10).
10. I go in front of blue_ball_1 (achieving the goal).

However, there's a potential issue: constraint 6 requires that after I'm in room_2, I must be in front of yellow_ball_1 or holding blue_ball_1. yellow_ball_1 is in room_1, which I can't enter, so I need to be holding blue_ball_1. But this means I need to start in room_2, get blue_ball_1 from room_3, and then come back to room_2 while holding it.

Let me rethink this...

Actually, the initial state says I start in room_2, and I've already visited it. So, constraint 5 is already satisfied. For constraint 6, after being in room_2, I need to be in front of yellow_ball_1 or holding blue_ball_1 at some point. Since I can't enter room_1 to go in front of yellow_ball_1, I must hold blue_ball_1 at some point after starting.

So, I need to get to room_3, pick up blue_ball_1, and then the goal is to be in front of blue_ball_1. But once I pick it up, I'm no longer in front of it. This is confusing.

Oh, I misunderstood. The goal is to be in front of a blue ball, not specifically blue_ball_1. In this case, blue_ball_1 is the only blue ball in the world.

Let's rethink the plan:

1. I start in room_2 with purple_box_1.
2. I need to go to room_3 to find blue_ball_1, but I need to do a few things first based on the constraints.
3. I need to have been in front of blue_box_1 or an empty position before going to room_3 (constraint 4).
4. I need to be in front of purple_door_1 at some point, and before that, I need to have been in front of blue_box_1 or in room_4 (constraints 7 and 8).
5. After being in room_2, I need to be in front of yellow_ball_1 or holding blue_ball_1 (constraint 6).

Given these constraints, it seems like I should:
1. Go to room_4 first (via green_door_1 from room_2).
2. Go in front of blue_box_1 (satisfying a precondition for constraints 4 and 8).
3. Go to room_3 (via yellow_door_2 from room_4).
4. Pick up blue_ball_1 (satisfying constraint 6 and 9).
5. Go in front of purple_door_1 (satisfying constraint 7).
6. Go in front of blue_ball_1 (achieving the goal).

Wait, if I pick up blue_ball_1, it's no longer in the room for me to be in front of. I need to be careful here.

Let's reconsider:

- For constraint 6, after being in room_2, I need to be in front of yellow_ball_1 or holding blue_ball_1. Since I can't go to room_1 to see yellow_ball_1, I need to hold blue_ball_1 at some point. blue_ball_1 is in room_3.
- For constraint 9, I need to hold some object. This could be blue_ball_1 or any other object.
- The goal is to be in front of a blue ball. blue_ball_1 is the only blue ball in the world.

Hmm, there seems to be a contradiction: I need to hold blue_ball_1 for constraint 6, but I also need to be in front of it for the goal. Maybe I need to pick it up, and then drop it to be in front of it again?

Let's refine the plan:

1. Start in room_2.
2. Go in front of green_door_1.
3. Toggle green_door_1 to unlock it.
4. Go to room_4 via green_door_1.
5. Go in front of blue_box_1 (satisfying a precondition for constraints 4 and 8).
6. Pick up blue_box_1 (satisfying constraint 9).
7. Go in front of yellow_door_2.
8. Toggle yellow_door_2 to unlock it.
9. Go to room_3 via yellow_door_2 (satisfying constraint 3). I bring blue_box_1 with me, so now blue_box_1 is in room_3 (satisfying constraint 10).
10. Go in front of purple_door_1 (satisfying constraint 7).
11. Go in front of blue_ball_1.
12. Drop blue_box_1.
13. Pick up blue_ball_1 (satisfying constraint 6).
14. Go to room_2 via paths we've unlocked.
15. Go in front of green_door_1.
16. Go to room_4 via green_door_1.
17. Go in front of yellow_door_2.
18. Go to room_3 via yellow_door_2.
19. Drop blue_ball_1.
20. Go in front of blue_ball_1 (achieving the goal).

This plan seems to work! Let's translate it into the action format provided.

Actually, let me first check if there's a more efficient plan. The current plan has a lot of steps, especially with the back-and-forth movements. Maybe we can optimize it.

Considering the goal and constraints again:
- Goal: Be in front of a blue ball (blue_ball_1).
- Constraint 6: After being in room_2, I need to be in front of yellow_ball_1 or holding blue_ball_1 at some point.

Since I start in room_2 and have already visited it, we're already at the starting point for constraint 6. I need to be holding blue_ball_1 at some point after this (since I can't go to room_1 to see yellow_ball_1).

However, the actual goal is just to be in front of blue_ball_1, not to hold it. So, I can pick up blue_ball_1 to satisfy constraint 6 and then drop it again to satisfy the goal.

Let's revise the plan:

1. Start in room_2.
2. Go in front of green_door_1.
3. Toggle green_door_1 to unlock it.
4. Go to room_4 via green_door_1.
5. Go in front of blue_box_1 (satisfying a precondition for constraints 4 and 8).
6. Go in front of yellow_door_2.
7. Toggle yellow_door_2 to unlock it.
8. Go to room_3 via yellow_door_2 (satisfying constraint 3).
9. Go in front of purple_door_1 (satisfying constraint 7).
10. Go in front of blue_ball_1.
11. Pick up blue_ball_1 (satisfying constraints 6 and 9).
12. Drop blue_ball_1 (to be in front of it again).
13. Go in front of blue_ball_1 (achieving the goal).

This revised plan is more efficient and still satisfies all the constraints. Let's translate this into the action format.

Actually, I think we're forgetting constraint 10: either blue_box_1 is in room_3 or I must be in front of yellow_ball_1. Since I can't go to room_1 to see yellow_ball_1, I need to make sure blue_box_1 is in room_3 at some point.

Revising the plan again:

1. Start in room_2.
2. Go in front of green_door_1.
3. Toggle green_door_1 to unlock it.
4. Go to room_4 via green_door_1.
5. Go in front of blue_box_1 (satisfying a precondition for constraints 4 and 8).
6. Pick up blue_box_1.
7. Go in front of yellow_door_2.
8. Toggle yellow_door_2 to unlock it.
9. Go to room_3 via yellow_door_2 (satisfying constraint 3). Since I'm carrying blue_box_1, it's now in room_3 (satisfying constraint 10).
10. Drop blue_box_1 (to ensure it's in room_3 for constraint 10).
11. Go in front of purple_door_1 (satisfying constraint 7).
12. Go in front of blue_ball_1.
13. Pick up blue_ball_1 (satisfying constraints 6 and 9).
14. Drop blue_ball_1 (to be in front of it again).
15. Go in front of blue_ball_1 (achieving the goal).

This plan satisfies all the constraints. Let me translate it into the action format:

1. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4`
2. `toggle green_door_1`
3. `gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1`
4. `gotoobject blue_box_1 room_4`
5. `pick blue_box_1 room_4`
6. `gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_3`
7. `toggle yellow_door_2`
8. `gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_2`
9. `gotoempty`
10. `drop blue_box_1 room_3`
11. `gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_1`
12. `gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_3`
13. `pick blue_ball_1 room_3`
14. `gotoempty`
15. `drop blue_ball_1 room_3`
16. `gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_3`

Hmm, wait. Steps 14 and 15 involve dropping blue_ball_1 in an empty position and then going in front of it. But when I drop an object, the effect is "you are in front of x". So I don't need to go to blue_ball_1 after dropping it. Let's correct this:

1. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4`
2. `toggle green_door_1`
3. `gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1`
4. `gotoobject blue_box_1 room_4`
5. `pick blue_box_1 room_4`
6. `gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_3`
7. `toggle yellow_door_2`
8. `gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_2`
9. `gotoempty`
10. `drop blue_box_1 room_3`
11. `gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_1`
12. `gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_3`
13. `pick blue_ball_1 room_3`
14. `gotoempty`
15. `drop blue_ball_1 room_3` (Now I'm in front of blue_ball_1, satisfying the goal)

Actually, steps 14 and 15 can be further optimized. I can drop blue_ball_1 at the empty position I'm in front of, and the effect will be that I'm now in front of blue_ball_1. Let's refine:

1. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4`
2. `toggle green_door_1`
3. `gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1`
4. `gotoobject blue_box_1 room_4`
5. `pick blue_box_1 room_4`
6. `gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_3`
7. `toggle yellow_door_2`
8. `gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_2`
9. `gotoempty`
10. `drop blue_box_1 room_3`
11. `gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_1`
12. `gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_3`
13. `pick blue_ball_1 room_3`
14. `gotoempty`
15. `drop blue_ball_1 room_3` (Now I'm in front of blue_ball_1, satisfying the goal)

However, I notice here that constraint 6 is a bit confusing: after being in room_2, I need to be in front of yellow_ball_1 or holding blue_ball_1 at some point. If I interpret this as "at some point after being in room_2, I need to be in front of yellow_ball_1 OR at some point after being in room_2, I need to be holding blue_ball_1", then this plan works.

But if I interpret it as "at some point after being in room_2, I need to be in front of yellow_ball_1 OR at some point after being in room_2, I need to be holding blue_ball_1 AND be in room_2", then I would need to take blue_ball_1 back to room_2 at some point. Let's assume the first interpretation.

Let's double-check the constraints:

1. Purple_door_1 must always be locked - Met.
2. I never enter room_1 - Met.
3. I visit room_3 at some point - Met (step 8).
4. Before I visit room_3, I've been in front of blue_box_1 or an empty position - Met (steps 4 and 9).
5. I visit room_2 at some point - Met (I start there).
6. After being in room_2, I'm in front of yellow_ball_1 or holding blue_ball_1 at some point - Met (step 13).
7. I'm in front of purple_door_1 at some point - Met (step 11).
8. Before being in front of purple_door_1, I've been in front of blue_box_1 or in room_4 - Met (steps 4 and 3).
9. I hold some object at some point - Met (steps 5 and 13).
10. At some point, either blue_box_1 is in room_3 or I'm in front of yellow_ball_1 - Met (step 10).

Great! Let's finalize our plan:

1. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4`
2. `toggle green_door_1`
3. `gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1`
4. `gotoobject blue_box_1 room_4`
5. `pick blue_box_1 room_4`
6. `gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_3`
7. `toggle yellow_door_2`
8. `gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_2`
9. `gotoempty`
10. `drop blue_box_1 room_3`
11. `gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_1`
12. `gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_3`
13. `pick blue_ball_1 room_3`
14. `gotoempty`
15. `drop blue_ball_1 room_3`

This plan satisfies all the constraints and achieves the goal of being in front of blue_ball_1.

Actually, I'm still confused about step 9. After step 8, I enter room_3. For step 9, I go to an empty position in room_3. Is this correct? Then for step 10, I drop blue_box_1 in the empty position, and now I'm in front of blue_box_1.

Actually, to simplify, I can go directly in front of an empty position after entering room_3, drop blue_box_1 there, and then proceed. This ensures blue_box_1 is in room_3 for constraint 10.

So, our final plan:

1. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4`
2. `toggle green_door_1`
3. `gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1`
4. `gotoobject blue_box_1 room_4`
5. `pick blue_box_1 room_4`
6. `gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_3`
7. `toggle yellow_door_2`
8. `gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_2`
9. `gotoempty`
10. `drop blue_box_1 room_3`
11. `gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_1`
12. `gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_3`
13. `pick blue_ball_1 room_3`
14. `gotoempty`
15. `drop blue_ball_1 room_3`

This should be the optimal plan for this problem. Let me just double-check my interpretation of the problem again.

Actually, I see a mistake in my plan. In steps 13-15, I'm picking up blue_ball_1, going to an empty position, and dropping it. But the goal is to be in front of blue_ball_1, not to manipulate it. I should just go in front of blue_ball_1 and stay there.

Revising the plan:

1. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4`
2. `toggle green_door_1`
3. `gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1`
4. `gotoobject blue_box_1 room_4`
5. `pick blue_box_1 room_4`
6. `gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_3`
7. `toggle yellow_door_2`
8. `gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_2`
9. `gotoempty`
10. `drop blue_box_1 room_3`
11. `gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_1`
12. `gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_3`
13. `pick blue_ball_1 room_3`
14. `gotoempty`
15. `drop blue_ball_1 room_3`

Wait, I'm confused again. Let me just carefully discuss the steps:

The goal is: "There is a ball v such that "The following conditions are all true: "v is blue", "you are in front of v"""

That means I need to be in front of a blue ball, which is blue_ball_1 in this world. But constraint 6 requires that after being in room_2, I need to be in front of yellow_ball_1 or holding blue_ball_1 at some point. Since I can't go to room_1 to see yellow_ball_1, I need to hold blue_ball_1 at some point.

So, I need to pick up blue_ball_1 to satisfy constraint 6. But once I pick it up, I'm no longer in front of it to satisfy the goal. Therefore, I need to drop it again to be in front of it.

Let's think about this step-by-step:

1. Start in room_2.
2. Go to room_4 via green_door_1 (after unlocking it).
3. Go in front of blue_box_1 in room_4 (satisfying a precondition for constraints 4 and 8).
4. Pick up blue_box_1 (satisfying constraint 9).
5. Go to room_3 via yellow_door_2 (after unlocking it). Now blue_box_1 is in room_3 (satisfying constraint 10).
6. Drop blue_box_1 somewhere in room_3.
7. Go in front of purple_door_1 (satisfying constraint 7).
8. Go in front of blue_ball_1.
9. Pick up blue_ball_1 (satisfying constraint 6).
10. Drop blue_ball_1 again (so I can be in front of it, satisfying the goal).

Translated to the action format provided, the plan would be:

1. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4`
2. `toggle green_door_1`
3. `gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1`
4. `gotoobject blue_box_1 room_4`
5. `pick blue_box_1 room_4`
6. `gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_3`
7. `toggle yellow_door_2`
8. `gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_2`
9. `gotoempty`
10. `drop blue_box_1 room_3`
11. `gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_1`
12. `gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_3`
13. `pick blue_ball_1 room_3`
14. `gotoempty`
15. `drop blue_ball_1 room_3`

Alright, I think this plan is correct. Let's double-check the constraints and our satisfaction of them:

1. Purple_door_1 must always be locked - Met (we never unlock or use it).
2. I never enter room_1 - Met (we never go to room_1).
3. I visit room_3 at some point - Met (step 8).
4. Before I visit room_3, I've been in front of blue_box_1 or an empty position - Met (step 4).
5. I visit room_2 at some point - Met (we start there).
6. After being in room_2, I'm in front of yellow_ball_1 or holding blue_ball_1 at some point - Met (step 13).
7. I'm in front of purple_door_1 at some point - Met (step 11).
8. Before being in front of purple_door_1, I've been in front of blue_box_1 or in room_4 - Met (steps 4 and 3).
9. I hold some object at some point - Met (steps 5 and 13).
10. At some point, either blue_box_1 is in room_3 or I'm in front of yellow_ball_1 - Met (steps 8-10).

Indeed, our goal is also met: after dropping blue_ball_1 in step 15, the effect is that I'm in front of it.

I think this plan is optimal. Let's review once more:

Actually, I'm a bit uncertain about step 11. In this step, after dropping blue_box_1, I go in front of purple_door_1. But purple_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3. Since I'm in room_3, I should be able to go in front of purple_door_1.

However, the action for going in front of a door is `gotodoor d r1 r2`, where d is the door, r1 is the current room, and r2 is the connected room. So, for purple_door_1, it would be `gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_1`.

Let's finalize our plan:

1. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4`
2. `toggle green_door_1`
3. `gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1`
4. `gotoobject blue_box_1 room_4`
5. `pick blue_box_1 room_4`
6. `gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_3`
7. `toggle yellow_door_2`
8. `gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_2`
9. `gotoempty`
10. `drop blue_box_1 room_3`
11. `gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_1`
12. `gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_3`
13. `pick blue_ball_1 room_3`
14. `gotoempty`
15. `drop blue_ball_1 room_3`

This is our final plan, and it should be optimal for this problem.
