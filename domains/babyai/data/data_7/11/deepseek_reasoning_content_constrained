Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. So, the goal is to have a blue ball that I'm in front of. The initial state says I'm in room_2. Let's look at the objects: blue_ball_1 is in room_3, and blue_box_1 is in room_4. So the target must be blue_ball_1 since it's a ball.

Constraints are a bit complex. Let's list them out:

1. Purple_door_1 must always be locked. So I can't toggle it. Also, I can't be in room_1 at any time. So any path through room_1 is off-limits. But purple_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3. Since I can't go to room_1, maybe I can ignore that door.

2. Must be in room_3 at least once. Also, if I'm in room_3, there must have been an earlier state where I was in front of blue_box_1 or empty. Hmm.

3. Must be in room_2 at least once. And when I'm in room_2 in some state, either I'm in front of yellow_ball_1 (which is in room_1, which I can't enter) or holding blue_ball_1. But since I can't go to room_1, the only option is to hold blue_ball_1. So at some point after being in room_2, I need to hold blue_ball_1.

4. Must be in front of purple_door_1 at least once. And before that, I must have been in front of blue_box_1 or in room_4. Since purple_door_1 is in room_1 and room_3, but room_1 is forbidden, I must approach it from room_3. So to reach purple_door_1, I need to be in room_3. But how? Let's see the doors: room_2 connects to room_4 via green_door_1, and room_4 connects to room_3 via yellow_door_2. So maybe go from room_2 to room_4, then to room_3.

But all doors are initially locked. So I need to unlock them. Wait, the toggle action can unlock a door if it's locked. But purple_door_1 must stay locked. So I can't toggle that. The doors I can toggle are yellow_door_1 (connects room_1 and 2, but room_1 is forbidden), purple_door_1 (must stay locked), green_door_1 (connects room_2 and 4), yellow_door_2 (connects 3 and 4). So to get from room_2 to room_4, I need to unlock green_door_1. Then from room_4 to room_3 via yellow_door_2, which is also locked. So I need to unlock that too.

Wait, initial state says all doors are locked. So to move between rooms, I have to go to the door, toggle it to unlock, then go through. But let's think step by step.

Starting in room_2. Need to get to room_3 to get the blue_ball_1. So possible path: room_2 -> room_4 via green_door_1 (unlock it), then room_4 -> room_3 via yellow_door_2 (unlock it). Then in room_3, pick up blue_ball_1 and bring it back? But the goal is to be in front of it. Wait, the goal is to have a blue ball that I'm in front of. So if blue_ball_1 is in room_3, maybe I can just go there and be in front of it. But I need to make sure that I can reach room_3.

But the constraints require that I must be in room_3 at least once. Also, when in room_3, there must have been an earlier state where I was in front of blue_box_1 (which is in room_4) or empty. So to fulfill that, perhaps when going from room_4 to room_3 via yellow_door_2, I first go to blue_box_1 in room_4, then to the door. Or maybe after entering room_4, go to an empty spot first. But how?

Also, another constraint: must be in front of purple_door_1. Since purple_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3, but room_1 is forbidden, the only way is to be in room_3 and go to purple_door_1. But how? In room_3, the door connects to room_1, which is off-limits. But the action gotodoor would require being in a room connected by the door. So in room_3, I can go to purple_door_1. But before that, I need to have been in front of blue_box_1 (in room_4) or in room_4. So if I go from room_4 to room_3, then in room_3, go to purple_door_1. But the prior state would have been in room_4. So being in room_4 counts as the earlier state. So that would satisfy the constraint.

Also, need to be in room_2 at least once. Since I start there, that's covered. But the constraint says if I'm in room_2 in some state, then in that state or a later one, I must be in front of yellow_ball_1 (can't because it's in room_1) or holding blue_ball_1. So after leaving room_2, I need to eventually hold blue_ball_1. So once I pick it up, that's satisfied.

Another constraint: must be holding some object at least once. So I have to pick up something. Since the goal requires being in front of a blue ball, which I can achieve by being in front of blue_ball_1 in room_3. But maybe I have to pick it up and drop it again? Or can I just go to it? Let's check the preconditions for being in front of it. To gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_3, I must be in room_3. So once I'm in room_3, I can go to it. But if I pick it up, then drop it, I can be in front of it again. But the goal just requires that in the final state, there exists a blue ball that I'm in front of. So blue_ball_1 is already in room_3. So if I can reach room_3 and go to it, that would satisfy the goal. But perhaps the doors are locked, so I need to unlock them.

So steps:

1. Unlock green_door_1 (connects room_2 and 4). To do that, I need to go to the door in room_2. So:

- gotoempty (since starting in room_2, maybe not in front of anything). Or maybe gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4. But preconditions for gotodoor: must be in a room connected by the door (yes, room_2 is connected via green_door_1 to room_4). Also, no object blocking the position in front of d in current room. Are there any objects blocking doors? The initial state doesn't mention any objects blocking doors. The effects of drop mention that if an object is blocking a door, then picking it up removes the block. But initial state doesn't state any blocking. So perhaps doors are not blocked. So can go to green_door_1 in room_2.

So:

Action: gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4

Then toggle it to unlock.

Action: toggle green_door_1

Now, green_door_1 is unlocked.

Then, go to room_4 via green_door_1.

Action: gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1

Now in room_4. Need to unlock yellow_door_2 to go to room_3. So go to yellow_door_2 in room_4.

Action: gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_3

Then toggle it.

Action: toggle yellow_door_2

Now yellow_door_2 is unlocked.

Gotoroom from room_4 to room_3 via yellow_door_2.

Action: gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_2

Now in room_3. Now, blue_ball_1 is here. So need to go to it.

But also, the constraint that when in room_3, there must have been an earlier state where I was in front of blue_box_1 (in room_4) or empty. So when I was in room_4, maybe I went to empty. Let's check the steps. When I went to room_4, I did gotoroom, which makes me not in front of anything. So after entering room_4, I was in the room but not in front of anything. Wait, the effect of gotoroom is that you are no longer in front of any object or door. So after entering room_4, I'm in room_4 and not in front of anything. So to satisfy the condition for room_3, perhaps when in room_4, I need to gotoempty, which would make me in front of empty. Then when I go to room_3, the earlier state (being in front of empty) would satisfy the condition.

So revising steps:

After arriving in room_4 (from room_2 via green_door_1), do:

Action: gotoempty

Then proceed to unlock yellow_door_2 and go to room_3. That way, when in room_3, the earlier state of being in front of empty (in room_4) satisfies the constraint.

So steps so far:

1. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4

2. toggle green_door_1

3. gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1

4. gotoempty

5. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_3

6. toggle yellow_door_2

7. gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_2

Now in room_3. Then need to go to blue_ball_1.

Action: gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_3

Now in front of blue_ball_1. That would satisfy the goal, but wait: the goal is "there exists a ball v such that v is blue and you are in front of v". So being in front of blue_ball_1 in room_3 meets the goal.

But there's another constraint: the expression "blue_box_1 is in room_3" or "you are in front of yellow_ball_1" must hold at least once. Since blue_box_1 is in room_4, unless we move it. But moving it would require picking it up and dropping in room_3. But that's extra steps. Alternatively, being in front of yellow_ball_1 is impossible because it's in room_1 which is forbidden. So the only way is to have blue_box_1 in room_3. But that's not part of the goal. Wait, the constraint says "at least one of the following must hold in at least one state: blue_box_1 in room_3 or you are in front of yellow_ball_1". Since yellow_ball_1 is inaccessible, the only way is to move blue_box_1 to room_3. But the initial state says blue_box_1 is in room_4. So to satisfy this, perhaps we need to pick up blue_box_1 from room_4, carry it to room_3, and drop it there.

But this adds steps. Let's see if that's necessary. The constraint says this must hold in at least one state. So if we can do this during the plan, then it's okay. For example, when we are in room_4, we can pick up blue_box_1, carry it to room_3, and drop it. Then, in that state, blue_box_1 is in room_3. That would satisfy the constraint. But this requires:

After step 3 (gotoroom to room_4), before going to room_3, do:

gotoobject blue_box_1 room_4

pick blue_box_1 room_4

Then, when moving to room_3, carry it, and drop it there.

But this adds steps. Also, the constraint for when in room_2: after being in room_2, must hold blue_ball_1. But if we have to carry blue_box_1, then we can't hold blue_ball_1 until we drop blue_box_1. So maybe this complicates things. Alternatively, maybe there's another way.

Wait, the constraint is that "The following expression must hold in at least one state: At least one of the following conditions is true: blue_box_1 is in room_3, you are in front of yellow_ball_1". Since we can't be in front of yellow_ball_1, the only option is moving blue_box_1 to room_3. So we have to do that. So let's adjust the plan.

After entering room_4 (step 3), go to blue_box_1:

Action: gotoobject blue_box_1 room_4

Pick it up:

Action: pick blue_box_1 room_4

Now holding blue_box_1. Then proceed to unlock yellow_door_2 and go to room_3. Then drop it in room_3.

But after picking up blue_box_1, when we goto the door, we need to drop it somewhere. Wait, no: when moving between rooms, you can carry objects. The goto_room action's effect is that you are in the new room, and no longer in front of anything, but holding is not affected. So, when you pick up blue_box_1 in room_4, then go to room_3, you are still holding it. Then, in room_3, you can drop it. But the problem is, the goal is to be in front of a blue ball (blue_ball_1). So after dropping blue_box_1 in room_3, then go to blue_ball_1.

But let's outline this:

Revised steps after entering room_4:

3. gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1

4. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_4

5. pick blue_box_1 room_4

6. gotoempty (to get to a position to go to the door?)

Wait, after picking up blue_box_1, to go to the door, need to be in the same room. So in room_4:

7. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_3

8. toggle yellow_door_2 (unlock)

9. gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_2

Now in room_3, holding blue_box_1. Then drop it:

10. drop blue_box_1 room_3

Now blue_box_1 is in room_3, satisfying the constraint.

Then, go to blue_ball_1:

11. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_3

But blue_ball_1 is already in room_3. So this action would make me in front of it, satisfying the goal.

But also, when I'm in room_2, the constraint says that in some state after, I must hold blue_ball_1. Wait, the constraint says: if you are in room_2 in some state s, then either in s or after, you must be in front of yellow_ball_1 or holding blue_ball_1. Since we started in room_2 (initial state), but according to the initial state, "you have visited room_2". So the first state is room_2. So the constraint applies here. So after the initial state, which is room_2, the agent must eventually hold blue_ball_1. But in this plan, the agent holds blue_box_1 and then drops it. So blue_ball_1 is still in room_3. So the agent needs to pick up blue_ball_1 after dropping blue_box_1.

Wait, but after step 11, the agent is in front of blue_ball_1. Then, to hold it, need to pick it up. But the goal is just to be in front of it, not necessarily holding it. But the constraint requires that after being in room_2 (the initial state), the agent must hold blue_ball_1 at some point. So even if the goal is achieved by being in front of it, the constraint requires holding it at some point.

So the plan needs to include picking up blue_ball_1. Let's adjust.

After step 11: being in front of blue_ball_1, pick it up.

12. pick blue_ball_1 room_3

Now holding it. Then, perhaps drop it again to be in front of it. But that's unnecessary. Because the goal is to be in front of a blue ball. If you're holding it, you can't be in front of it unless you drop it. Because when you pick it up, you're no longer in front of it. So after picking it up, you need to drop it again to be in front of it.

But maybe there's another approach. Let's see:

After step 9: in room_3, holding blue_box_1.

10. drop blue_box_1 room_3 (now blue_box_1 is in room_3, satisfying the constraint)

11. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_3

12. pick blue_ball_1 room_3 (now holding it, which satisfies the constraint about holding some object, and also the room_2 constraint)

13. Then, to be in front of it, need to drop it.

But after dropping, you are in front of it. So:

13. drop blue_ball_1 room_3

Now, you're in front of blue_ball_1, satisfying the goal.

But let's check the steps:

After step 12, holding blue_ball_1. To drop it, need to be in front of an empty position. So:

13. gotoempty (in room_3)

14. drop blue_ball_1 room_3

But after dropping, you're in front of it. Wait, the drop action's effect is that you are in front of x after dropping. So if you drop it in room_3, you are now in front of blue_ball_1, which satisfies the goal.

So steps would be:

After dropping blue_box_1 (step 10):

11. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_3

12. pick blue_ball_1 room_3 (now holding it)

13. drop blue_ball_1 room_3 (now in front of it)

But step 13 requires being in a position to drop. The preconditions for drop are that you are holding the object and the position in front is empty. Wait, when you pick up blue_ball_1, you are no longer in front of it (effect of pick is you are no longer in front of x). Then, after picking, you need to go to an empty spot and drop. Or perhaps you can drop immediately if the spot is empty.

Wait, when you pick up blue_ball_1, you are in front of it before picking. After picking, you are no longer in front of it. To drop it, you need to be in front of an empty position. So after picking, you can gotoempty (if there's an empty spot in room_3) then drop.

So:

12. pick blue_ball_1 room_3

13. gotoempty (in room_3)

14. drop blue_ball_1 room_3

Now, you are in front of blue_ball_1.

This achieves the goal. Also, the constraint about holding an object is satisfied in step 12.

Now, check other constraints:

- Must be in front of purple_door_1 at least once. Purple_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3. Since we can't go to room_1, we can approach it from room_3. So in room_3, after dropping blue_ball_1, go to purple_door_1.

15. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_1

But the precondition is that you are in a room connected by the door. Since room_3 is connected via purple_door_1 to room_1, this is allowed. But room_1 is off-limits, but just being in front of the door in room_3 is okay.

But before that, the constraint for being in front of purple_door_1 requires that in an earlier state, you were in front of blue_box_1 or in room_4. Earlier steps: in room_4, we were in front of blue_box_1 (step 4) and in room_4 (step 3). So this is satisfied.

So adding step 15: gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_1

Now, in front of purple_door_1. This satisfies that constraint.

Also, the constraint that you are in room_3 at least once is satisfied (steps 9 onwards).

Also, must be in room_2 at least once. The initial state is room_2, so that's covered. And after leaving room_2, eventually holding blue_ball_1 (step 12), which satisfies the constraint that in some state after being in room_2, you hold blue_ball_1.

Another constraint: you must hold some object. That's satisfied in step 12.

So the full plan would be:

1. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4
2. toggle green_door_1
3. gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1
4. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_4
5. pick blue_box_1 room_4
6. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_3
7. toggle yellow_door_2
8. gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_2
9. drop blue_box_1 room_3
10. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_3
11. pick blue_ball_1 room_3
12. gotoempty
13. drop blue_ball_1 room_3
14. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_1

Wait, but after step 8, you are in room_3, holding blue_box_1. So step 9 is drop in room_3. Then steps 10-13 to handle blue_ball_1. Then step 14 to go to purple_door_1.

But wait, after dropping blue_box_1 (step 9), then gotoobject blue_ball_1 (step10) is possible because blue_ball_1 is in room_3. Then pick it up (step11), then gotoempty (step12) to drop (step13). Then gotodoor purple_door_1 (step14).

But let's check the order. Also, after step13, you are in front of blue_ball_1, satisfying the goal. Then step14 is needed to fulfill the constraint of being in front of purple_door_1. But the goal only requires the final state to have you in front of a blue ball. However, the constraints require that certain conditions are met at some state. So even if after achieving the goal, you need to do additional steps to fulfill other constraints. But the problem states that the plan must bring about the goal while satisfying all constraints. So the plan must have all constraints met in some state, not necessarily in the final state. So after dropping blue_ball_1 (step13), the goal is achieved, but we still need to be in front of purple_door_1. So step14 must be part of the plan.

But the problem says the plan should be optimal (shortest possible). So maybe there's a way to combine steps. For example, after dropping blue_ball_1 (step13), can you go to purple_door_1 directly? Let's see.

Another point: when you drop blue_ball_1 (step13), you are in front of it. Then you need to go to purple_door_1. So:

After step13:

14. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_1

Which is possible as you're in room_3.

But this adds steps, making the plan longer. Is there a way to optimize?

Wait, maybe after dropping blue_box_1 (step9), you can go to purple_door_1 first before handling blue_ball_1. Let's see:

After step9 (drop blue_box_1 in room_3):

10. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_1 (satisfy the constraint of being in front of purple_door_1)

Then proceed to handle blue_ball_1. But then when you go to blue_ball_1, you are no longer in front of purple_door_1, but the constraint just requires being in front of it at least once, which step10 would achieve.

But this way, steps could be:

9. drop blue_box_1 room_3

10. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_1

11. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_3

12. pick blue_ball_1 room_3

13. gotoempty

14. drop blue_ball_1 room_3

This way, step10 fulfills the purple_door_1 constraint. Then steps11-14 achieve the goal. But this adds steps. However, the initial plan would have steps up to 14 (gotodoor purple_door_1). The alternative would be 14 steps. But maybe there's a shorter way.

Alternatively, after step9 (drop blue_box_1), go to purple_door_1, then to blue_ball_1, pick and drop. Let's see:

9. drop blue_box_1 room_3

10. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_1

11. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_3

12. pick blue_ball_1 room_3

13. drop blue_ball_1 room_3 (since after picking, you need to drop in front of empty, but after step11, you are in front of blue_ball_1. Wait, after picking, you're no longer in front of it. So to drop, need to gotoempty first.

So:

13. gotoempty

14. drop blue_ball_1 room_3

Then you're in front of blue_ball_1. So this adds steps. So original plan had 14 steps. But maybe there's a way to optimize.

Wait, let's recount the steps in the original plan:

1. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4

2. toggle green_door_1

3. gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1

4. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_4

5. pick blue_box_1 room_4

6. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_3

7. toggle yellow_door_2

8. gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_2

9. drop blue_box_1 room_3

10. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_3

11. pick blue_ball_1 room_3

12. gotoempty

13. drop blue_ball_1 room_3

14. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_1

That's 14 steps. But maybe some steps can be merged or omitted. For example, after step3 (entering room_4), instead of going to blue_box_1, can we go to the door directly? No, because we need to pick up blue_box_1 to move it to room_3. So step4 is necessary.

Alternatively, can we avoid moving blue_box_1? Let's see. The constraint requires that at least one state has blue_box_1 in room_3 or in front of yellow_ball_1. Since yellow_ball_1 is inaccessible, the only option is moving blue_box_1 to room_3. So step4-5,9 are necessary.

Another point: after step3, in room_4, the constraint for being in room_3 requires that before entering room_3, we were in front of blue_box_1 or empty. If we just gotoempty in room_4, that would satisfy the condition. So perhaps instead of moving blue_box_1, just gotoempty in room_4. But then the other constraint (blue_box_1 in room_3 or in front of yellow_ball_1) isn't satisfied. So we can't avoid moving blue_box_1.

So the steps are necessary. Therefore, the plan is as above.

Now, check all constraints:

- Purple_door_1 remains locked. Because we never toggle it. Step14 is gotodoor purple_door_1, but toggle is not done. Since the initial state has it locked, and we don't toggle it, it remains locked. Good.

- Never in room_1. All steps are in rooms 2,4,3. Good.

- At least once in room_3: steps8 onwards.

- When in room_3, earlier state in front of blue_box_1 (step4) or in room_4 (step3). Yes, step3 is room_4 before step8.

- At least once in room_2: initial state.

- When in room_2 (initial state), after that, hold blue_ball_1 (step11). Yes.

- At least once in front of purple_door_1: step14.

- When in front of purple_door_1 (step14), earlier state was in room_4 (step3) or in front of blue_box_1 (step4). Yes.

- At least once holding an object: steps5, 11.

- At least once blue_box_1 in room_3 (step9) or in front of yellow_ball_1. Step9 satisfies it.

So all constraints are met.

The final step is step13 (drop blue_ball_1) and step14 (goto purple_door_1). But the goal is achieved at step13. The problem requires the final goal to be achieved, but other constraints can be met in any state. So the plan can end after step13, but we need to ensure that all constraints are met. However, step14 is necessary to fulfill the constraint of being in front of purple_door_1. Therefore, the plan must include step14.

But wait, the goal is to have a blue ball in front of you. So the final state should be that. But step14 makes you in front of purple_door_1, not the blue ball. So the plan must end with being in front of the blue ball. So perhaps after step14, you need to go back to the blue ball. But that would add steps. Alternatively, rearrange the steps.

Alternative approach:

After dropping blue_ball_1 (step13), you are in front of it. Then go to purple_door_1, but that would require leaving the front of the ball. Then the final state is in front of the door, which doesn't satisfy the goal. Therefore, the plan must end with being in front of the ball, so step13 is the last step, but step14 must be done before that. But that's not possible because step14 requires being in front of the door after step13.

Hmm, this is a problem. Because the goal requires the final state to have you in front of a blue ball. But the constraint requires being in front of purple_door_1 at least once. So you must have a step where you are in front of the door, but then you need to return to the ball. This increases the plan length.

So adjusted steps:

13. drop blue_ball_1 room_3 (now in front of it, goal achieved)

14. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_1 (fulfills the constraint)

15. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_3 (to end in front of it)

Now, the final state is step15, in front of blue_ball_1. But step14 is required. So the plan has 15 steps. But maybe there's a smarter way.

Wait, after step13 (drop blue_ball_1), you are in front of it. Then, step14 (goto purple_door_1) makes you no longer in front of it. Then step15 (goto blue_ball_1 again) brings you back. But this adds steps. Is there a way to do this without adding steps?

Alternative plan:

After step9 (drop blue_box_1), goto purple_door_1, then goto blue_ball_1, pick, drop, and then goto blue_ball_1 again.

But this seems inefficient. Perhaps the optimal plan must include these steps. Alternatively, after step13, you can toggle the door and return, but that's unnecessary.

Alternatively, can you fulfill the purple_door_1 constraint earlier? For example, after arriving in room_3 (step8), before dropping blue_box_1, go to purple_door_1. Then drop blue_box_1, then proceed.

So revised steps:

8. gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_2 (in room_3, holding blue_box_1)

9. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_1

10. drop blue_box_1 room_3 (now in front of blue_box_1, but need to gotoempty to drop?)

Wait, drop requires that the position in front is empty. When you are in front of purple_door_1 (step9), then you can drop blue_box_1 only if the position is empty. But doors might not be considered as objects blocking. Assuming that doors are not objects that block dropping, then after step9, you can drop blue_box_1 in front of purple_door_1.

But the drop action's effect is that you are in front of x after dropping. So if you drop blue_box_1 in room_3, you are in front of it. But in this case, after step9 (in front of purple_door_1), you can drop blue_box_1 there. Then, blue_box_1 is in room_3, satisfying the constraint. Then, you can proceed to handle blue_ball_1.

But this might block the purple_door_1. However, the problem doesn't mention doors being blocked by objects. The initial state doesn't state any doors as blocked. So assuming that dropping an object in front of a door doesn't block it. Or does it? The effect of picking up an object that was blocking a door removes the block. So perhaps when an object is in front of a door, it blocks it. So if we drop blue_box_1 in front of purple_door_1, it would block it. But the constraint requires that purple_door_1 remains locked, but doesn't care about being blocked. However, the preconditions for gotodoor require that there is no object blocking the door's position in the current room.

Wait, the precondition for gotodoor is: (ii) there is no object blocking the position in front of d in the room you are currently in.

So if you drop blue_box_1 in front of purple_door_1 in room_3, then later when trying to goto that door, it would be blocked. But in this plan, after dropping blue_box_1 there, you can't goto purple_door_1 again because it's blocked. But we already did step9 (gotodoor purple_door_1) before dropping. So perhaps this isn't a problem.

But this approach complicates things. Let's try:

8. gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_2 (in room_3, holding blue_box_1)

9. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_1

10. drop blue_box_1 room_3 (now in front of purple_door_1, blue_box_1 is in room_3)

11. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_3

12. pick blue_ball_1 room_3

13. gotoempty

14. drop blue_ball_1 room_3

This way, step9 fulfills the purple_door_1 constraint. Then steps11-14 achieve the goal. And blue_box_1 is in room_3. This would be 14 steps.

But then step10 is dropping blue_box_1 in front of purple_door_1. If that blocks the door, then future actions might be affected, but in this plan, after step9, we don't need to go to the door again. So it's acceptable.

This way, the steps are:

1. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4

2. toggle green_door_1

3. gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1

4. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_4

5. pick blue_box_1 room_4

6. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_3

7. toggle yellow_door_2

8. gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_2

9. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_1

10. drop blue_box_1 room_3

11. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_3

12. pick blue_ball_1 room_3

13. gotoempty

14. drop blue_ball_1 room_3

Now, check constraints:

- purple_door_1 remains locked: yes, never toggled.

- never in room_1: yes.

- in room_3: steps8 onwards.

- in room_3, earlier state in front of blue_box_1 (step4 in room_4) or in room_4 (step3). Yes.

- in room_2: initial state.

- after room_2, hold blue_ball_1 (step12).

- in front of purple_door_1: step9.

- before step9, in room_4 (step3) or in front of blue_box_1 (step4). Yes.

- holding object: steps5,12.

- blue_box_1 in room_3: step10.

So all constraints are met. And the goal is achieved at step14. This plan has 14 steps, same as previous, but step9 is done earlier.

But in step10, when dropping blue_box_1 in room_3, if it's in front of purple_door_1, would that block the door? If so, then when we try to gotoobject blue_ball_1, we might need to navigate around. But since the problem doesn't specify positions other than rooms and objects, perhaps the agent can move freely within the room as long as they use the actions. So even if blue_box_1 is in front of purple_door_1, the agent can gotoobject blue_ball_1 directly, as long as they are in the same room.

Thus, this plan is valid and shorter by one step.

But wait, step count:

Original plan steps: 14 (with step14 being gotodoor purple_door_1 after dropping blue_ball_1).

New plan steps: 14, but the gotodoor purple_door_1 is done earlier.

But in the new plan, after step10 (drop blue_box_1 in front of purple_door_1), when you gotoobject blue_ball_1, you are no longer in front of purple_door_1. So the constraint of being in front of purple_door_1 is satisfied at step9. The final state is step14, in front of blue_ball_1.

This plan seems valid and meets all constraints with 14 steps. But is there a way to make it shorter?

Another optimization: after step8 (arrive in room_3), you are holding blue_box_1. Can you drop it immediately?

Step8: gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_2 (in room_3, holding blue_box_1, not in front of anything)

Step9: drop blue_box_1 room_3 (but drop requires being in front of an empty position. Wait, no: the drop action's preconditions are that you are holding x and the position in front is empty. After step8, you are not in front of anything. So to drop, you need to be in front of an empty position. So:

Step9: gotoempty

Step10: drop blue_box_1 room_3

But this adds steps. So the plan becomes:

1. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4

2. toggle green_door_1

3. gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1

4. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_4

5. pick blue_box_1 room_4

6. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_3

7. toggle yellow_door_2

8. gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_2

9. gotoempty

10. drop blue_box_1 room_3

11. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_1

12. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_3

13. pick blue_ball_1 room_3

14. gotoempty

15. drop blue_ball_1 room_3

Now this is 15 steps, which is longer. So the previous plan with dropping blue_box_1 in front of purple_door_1 is better.

Alternatively, after arriving in room_3 (step8), go to purple_door_1 (step9), then drop blue_box_1 there (step10). Then goto blue_ball_1 (step11), pick (step12), gotoempty (step13), drop (step14). Total steps:14.

This seems to be the shortest possible. So the final plan is:

```
1. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4
2. toggle green_door_1
3. gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1
4. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_4
5. pick blue_box_1 room_4
6. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_3
7. toggle yellow_door_2
8. gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_2
9. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_1
10. drop blue_box_1 room_3
11. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_3
12. pick blue_ball_1 room_3
13. gotoempty
14. drop blue_ball_1 room_3
```

But step10: after being in front of purple_door_1 (step9), drop blue_box_1. Since you are in front of purple_door_1, dropping puts blue_box_1 there. Then, step11: gotoobject blue_ball_1 requires being in the same room (room_3), which is true. So possible.

But the drop action's precondition is that the position in front is empty. When you are in front of purple_door_1 (step9), then the position in front is the door. If the door's position is considered an empty position for dropping, then you can drop there. But according to the problem statement, the drop action's precondition is that the position in front is empty. The door is not an object (doors are separate), so perhaps the position in front of the agent when at the door is considered empty. Therefore, dropping blue_box_1 there is allowed. This would satisfy the drop precondition.

Thus, this plan is valid and meets all constraints with 14 steps. Now, check if all steps are necessary and in order.

Another possible optimization: after step8 (in room_3), can we immediately go to purple_door_1 before dropping blue_box_1? No, because we need to drop blue_box_1 in room_3. But we can drop it in front of the door. So step9: gotodoor purple_door_1, step10: drop. Yes.

This plan seems correct.
