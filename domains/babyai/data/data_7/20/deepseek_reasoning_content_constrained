Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. Hmm, the goal is to have a green door that I'm in front of and it's unlocked. The doors are yellow_door_1, grey_door_1, green_door_1, and yellow_door_2. Oh right, green_door_1 is green. So the final goal is to be in front of green_door_1 (since it's the only green door) and have it unlocked.

But there are a bunch of constraints to satisfy. Let me list them out:

1. At least once, yellow_door_2 is locked. Well, initially it's locked, so maybe that's covered if we don't unlock it until later. But need to check if any action might unlock it. Wait, the toggle action can lock or unlock. So maybe we need to ensure that at some point, yellow_door_2 is locked. Since it starts locked, as long as we don't toggle it until after that state is recorded, that's okay. But if we toggle it before, then we might have to relock it. Hmm.

2. If yellow_door_2 is locked in some state, then either yellow_door_1 is unlocked or blue_box_1 is in room_2 at that state or later. Since the initial state has yellow_door_2 locked, but the constraint requires that if it's locked in any state, then one of those conditions must hold in that state or after. So maybe when we first start, yellow_door_2 is locked, so we need to ensure that either yellow_door_1 is unlocked (which is initially locked) or blue_box_1 is moved to room_2. So perhaps we need to unlock yellow_door_1 or move blue_box_1 to room_2. But blue_box_1 is in room_3 initially. So moving it would require picking it up and taking it to room_2. Alternatively, unlocking yellow_door_1 might be part of the plan.

3. At least once, be in front of green_box_1. Green_box_1 is in room_4. So need to go to room_4 and gotoobject green_box_1 room_4.

4. At least once, green_door_1 is unlocked. Since the goal requires green_door_1 to be unlocked, but the constraint is that it must be unlocked in at least one state. So that's probably covered when we toggle it.

5. If green_door_1 is unlocked in some state, then in an earlier state, I was holding an object. So before unlocking green_door_1, I must have held something. So maybe pick up an object, drop it, then toggle the door. Or maybe use the object to unblock a door? Wait, the doors might be blocked by objects. For example, to goto a door, there must be no object blocking the position in front of it. So if a door is blocked, I need to move the object first. But in the initial state, are any doors blocked? Let's check the initial positions. The objects in each room: room_3 has blue_box_1, blue_ball_1, yellow_box_1. So in room_3, which doors are connected? grey_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3. yellow_door_2 connects room_3 and room_4. So if any of those doors have objects in front, but the initial positions don't say anything about being in front. Wait, the initial state doesn't mention any objects blocking doors. The problem states that "goto door" is allowed if there's no object blocking the position in front of d in the current room. So maybe the initial state has no doors blocked. So perhaps the doors are not blocked initially. So maybe that's not an issue. But to be safe, when moving through doors, need to ensure that the path is clear.

6. At least once, be in room_3. The initial state is room_3, so that's already satisfied. But maybe the plan requires leaving and returning. Wait, the constraint says "The following expression must hold in at least one state: you are in room_3". Since the initial state is room_3, that's already true. So unless the agent leaves and never comes back, but the problem might require other steps. But perhaps after leaving room_3, we have to come back. Wait, but the constraint just needs it to be true at least once. Since the initial state is room_3, that's covered. But there's another constraint: if you are in room_3 in some state s, then you must be in front of red_box_1 at s or later. But red_box_1 is in room_4. So if you are in room_3 at any point (including the initial state), you need to be in front of red_box_1 at some point. But red_box_1 is in room_4, so you can't be in front of it unless you are in room_4. So how to satisfy this? Because when you are in room_3 (initially), you need to eventually be in front of red_box_1. But red_box_1 is in room_4. So perhaps you have to go to room_4, gotoobject red_box_1 there. But the constraint is triggered by being in room_3. So even if you leave room_3 and then later go to room_4 and face red_box_1, does that satisfy it? The constraint says, if you are in room_3 in state s, then in s or some state after, you are in front of red_box_1. So the initial state is s where you are in room_3. So you need to, after the initial state, at some point be in front of red_box_1. Since red_box_1 is in room_4, you have to go to room_4 and face it.

7. At least once, holding blue_box_2. Blue_box_2 is in room_4. So need to go to room_4, pick it up.

8. At least once, yellow_door_1 is unlocked. Initially locked. So need to toggle it.

9. At least once, blue_ball_1 is in room_2. Blue_ball_1 is in room_3. So need to move it to room_2.

Putting this all together, the plan has to achieve the final goal (green_door_1 is unlocked and you're in front of it) while satisfying all these constraints.

First, let's outline the steps needed to get to the goal. To unlock green_door_1, which connects room_2 and room_4. To get to green_door_1, you need to be in room_2 or room_4. Since you start in room_3, you need to navigate through doors. Let's see the connections:

room_3 is connected to room_1 via grey_door_1 (locked initially) and to room_4 via yellow_door_2 (locked initially). So from room_3, doors are locked. So to move out of room_3, you need to unlock doors. But how? To toggle a door, you need to be in front of it. So first, in room_3, you can go to grey_door_1 or yellow_door_2.

But grey_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3. To unlock it, you need to be in front of it. So goto door grey_door_1 room_3 room_1 (since you're in room_3). Then toggle it. Then you can go to room_1. Similarly for yellow_door_2 to room_4.

But let's think about the constraints. We need to have yellow_door_2 locked at some point. It starts locked. If we toggle it to unlock, then it's unlocked. But the constraint requires that in some state, it's locked. So if we unlock it, then later lock it again, that would satisfy, but that's extra steps. But maybe we can avoid toggling it at all, so it remains locked. But to get to room_4, which is connected to room_3 via yellow_door_2, we need to unlock it. Because the door is locked, so to go through, it needs to be unlocked. So perhaps the plan requires unlocking yellow_door_2.

But wait, initial state: yellow_door_2 is locked. So to go from room_3 to room_4, you need to unlock yellow_door_2. So steps would be: gotoempty (to be in front of nothing), then gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_3 room_4. Then toggle it (unlock), then gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_2. Then you're in room_4.

But then, when you unlock yellow_door_2, it becomes unlocked. So if you later lock it again, then the state where it's locked is after that. But the constraint says that at some state, yellow_door_2 is locked. Since it starts locked, as long as we don't toggle it before that state is recorded, then the initial state counts. But if the plan requires toggling it, say, unlocking it to go to room_4, then in the initial state, it's locked, which satisfies the first constraint. But then the second constraint: if in any state s yellow_door_2 is locked, then in s or after, yellow_door_1 is unlocked or blue_box_1 is in room_2. So in the initial state, yellow_door_2 is locked, so we need that either yellow_door_1 is unlocked at some point (which we need to do anyway because of constraint 8) or blue_box_1 is moved to room_2 (constraint 9). Wait, constraint 9 is about blue_ball_1 in room_2, not blue_box_1. Oh right, constraint 9 is blue_ball_1 in room_2. So the second constraint is if yellow_door_2 is locked (as in initial state), then in that state or later, yellow_door_1 is not locked or blue_box_1 is in room_2. So since initial state has yellow_door_1 locked and blue_box_1 in room_3, we need to either unlock yellow_door_1 (which is constraint 8) or move blue_box_1 to room_2. But moving blue_box_1 to room_2 would require taking it through doors. Let's see: blue_box_1 is in room_3. To get it to room_2, you have to go from room_3 to room_1 via grey_door_1, then room_1 to room_2 via yellow_door_1. But both doors are locked. So to do that, you need to unlock grey_door_1 and yellow_door_1. Alternatively, maybe use another path.

But unlocking yellow_door_1 is required by constraint 8. So perhaps the plan includes unlocking yellow_door_1, which would satisfy both the second constraint and constraint 8. That seems efficient. So if we unlock yellow_door_1, then in the initial state where yellow_door_2 is locked, the condition is satisfied because yellow_door_1 is unlocked later. So the second constraint is satisfied because after the initial state, we unlock yellow_door_1, so in a later state, the condition holds.

Now, the constraints:

- Must be in front of green_box_1 (in room_4). So need to go to room_4, gotoobject green_box_1.

- Must have green_door_1 unlocked. So need to toggle it, which requires being in front of it. So green_door_1 connects room_2 and room_4. So to get in front of it, you can be in room_2 or room_4 and goto door green_door_1. Then toggle it.

- When you unlock green_door_1, you must have held an object before. So before toggling green_door_1, you need to have picked up and possibly dropped an object. For example, pick up blue_box_2 in room_4, then drop it, then unlock green_door_1. But need to hold it at some point before.

- Must hold blue_box_2. So in room_4, pick it up.

- Must have blue_ball_1 in room_2. So need to move it from room_3 to room_2. To do that, you need to carry it. So pick it up in room_3, take it through doors to room_2. But how? From room_3, the doors are grey_door_1 (to room_1) and yellow_door_2 (to room_4). Both are locked initially. So first, unlock yellow_door_2, go to room_4. Then perhaps go to room_2 via green_door_1 (but that's locked initially). Alternatively, unlock grey_door_1, go to room_1, unlock yellow_door_1 (since it's locked), go to room_2.

This is getting complicated. Let's sketch a possible path:

1. Start in room_3. Need to unlock doors to move.

2. To move blue_ball_1 to room_2, perhaps take this path: room_3 -> room_1 via grey_door_1 (needs unlocking), then room_1 -> room_2 via yellow_door_1 (needs unlocking). Then drop the ball in room_2.

But also need to go to room_4 for other constraints (green_box_1, blue_box_2, red_box_1). So maybe first go to room_4 via yellow_door_2.

So steps:

- From room_3, go to yellow_door_2 (gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_3 room_4). Then toggle (unlock), then go to room_4.

In room_4, pick up blue_box_2 (satisfy holding it), then drop it (maybe). Then goto green_door_1 (in room_4, connecting to room_2). But green_door_1 is locked. So need to unlock it. But before unlocking, need to have held an object. So pick up blue_box_2, then drop it, then goto door green_door_1, toggle it (unlock). Then go to room_2 via green_door_1.

But then in room_2, can drop the ball. Wait, but blue_ball_1 is in room_3. So to move it to room_2, need to carry it from room_3 to room_2. So maybe after unlocking yellow_door_1, go back to room_3, pick up blue_ball_1, then take it through room_1 and yellow_door_1 to room_2.

But this is getting complicated. Let's outline possible steps:

1. Start in room_3. Need to unlock grey_door_1 to get to room_1. But grey_door_1 is in room_3. So:

Action: gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1 (precondition: in room_3, door connects, no object blocking. Assuming no objects blocking, so allowed). Then toggle grey_door_1 (unlock). Then gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1. Now in room_1.

But in room_1, there's purple_ball_1. But perhaps not needed yet. Next, unlock yellow_door_1 to get to room_2. So in room_1, goto yellow_door_1 (gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2). Toggle to unlock. Then go to room_2.

Now in room_2. Yellow_ball_1 is here. Then need to get to room_4 via green_door_1. But green_door_1 is locked. So need to unlock it. But to unlock green_door_1, must be in front of it. So from room_2, goto green_door_1, toggle to unlock. Then go to room_4.

But before unlocking green_door_1, need to have held an object. So perhaps pick up yellow_ball_1 in room_2, then drop it, then unlock green_door_1. But yellow_ball_1 is in room_2. So pick it up, drop it, then unlock door.

But then, in room_4, need to handle green_box_1, blue_box_2, red_box_1. Need to be in front of green_box_1. Also need to hold blue_box_2. So in room_4, pick up blue_box_2, then drop it somewhere. Then goto green_box_1. Also, need to be in front of red_box_1 (constraint: if ever in room_3, which we were initially, need to be in front of red_box_1. So after leaving room_3, go to room_4 and face red_box_1. Since red_box_1 is in room_4, that's possible.

But how do we get back to room_3? Maybe after handling other steps. Also, need to get blue_ball_1 to room_2. So perhaps after unlocking doors, go back to room_3, pick up blue_ball_1, carry it to room_2 via room_1 and yellow_door_1.

But this seems like a lot of steps. Let's see if there's a more efficient path.

Alternative approach:

Start in room_3. Need to unlock yellow_door_2 to go to room_4.

1. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_3 room_4. Toggle to unlock. Now door is unlocked.

2. gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_2. Now in room_4.

3. In room_4, pick up blue_box_2 (satisfy holding it). Then drop it (maybe).

4. Now, need to unlock green_door_1. So goto green_door_1 from room_4 (gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2). Toggle to unlock. But before that, must have held an object. So step 3 picks up blue_box_2, step 4 drops it, then step 5: gotodoor green_door_1, step 6: toggle. Now green_door_1 is unlocked.

5. Now go to room_2 via green_door_1.

6. In room_2, need to unlock yellow_door_1 (constraint 8). So goto yellow_door_1, toggle to unlock.

7. Now, need to get blue_ball_1 to room_2. Blue_ball_1 is in room_3. So go back to room_4, then to room_3 via yellow_door_2 (which is now unlocked). But need to unlock yellow_door_2 again if it was locked. Wait, we toggled it in step 1 to unlock, so it's now unlocked. So can go back.

Wait, after step 2, we're in room_4. Then steps 3-6: in room_4, then room_2. To get back to room_3, from room_2, can go to room_4 via green_door_1, then to room_3 via yellow_door_2.

So:

After step 6 (in room_2), need to go back to room_3 to get blue_ball_1.

7. gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1. Now in room_4.

8. gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_2. Now back in room_3.

9. Pick up blue_ball_1.

10. Carry it to room_2. Path: room_3 -> room_1 via grey_door_1 (need to unlock it first? Wait, in initial steps, we didn't unlock grey_door_1. So grey_door_1 is still locked. So to get to room_1 from room_3, need to unlock grey_door_1.

So, after step 8 (back in room_3):

9. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1. Toggle to unlock.

10. gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1. Now in room_1.

11. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2. Already unlocked in step 6.

12. gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1. Now in room_2.

13. Drop blue_ball_1 here.

Now, blue_ball_1 is in room_2. Satisfies constraint 9.

But this is getting very long. Also, need to consider the constraint that when in room_3 (initially), must later be in front of red_box_1. Since red_box_1 is in room_4, after step 2 (in room_4), need to gotoobject red_box_1 room_4. So after step 2:

3. gotoobject red_box_1 room_4. Now in front of it. Satisfies the constraint.

But wait, the constraint says that if you are in room_3 in state s (including the initial state), then you must be in front of red_box_1 at s or after. So after the initial state, you leave room_3, go to room_4, and then goto red_box_1. That would satisfy the constraint.

So let's adjust the steps:

Initial state: room_3.

1. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_3 room_4. Toggle (unlock). Now yellow_door_2 is unlocked.

2. gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_2. Now in room_4.

3. gotoobject red_box_1 room_4. Now in front of it. Satisfies the constraint from being in room_3 earlier.

4. pick up blue_box_2. Now holding it.

5. drop blue_box_2. Now, since we need to have held it (constraint 7), and this action satisfies that.

6. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2. Toggle (unlock). Now green_door_1 is unlocked. Before this, we held blue_box_2 (step 4), so satisfies the constraint that before unlocking green_door_1, we held something.

7. gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_1. Now in room_2.

8. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_1. Toggle (unlock). Now yellow_door_1 is unlocked. Satisfies constraint 8.

Now, need to get blue_ball_1 to room_2. So:

9. gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1. Back to room_4.

10. gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_2. Back to room_3.

11. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_3. Pick it up.

12. Now need to take it to room_2. Path: room_3 -> room_1 via grey_door_1 (locked). So need to unlock grey_door_1.

12. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1. Toggle (unlock).

13. gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1. Now in room_1.

14. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2. Toggle is already unlocked.

15. gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1. Now in room_2.

16. drop blue_ball_1. Now it's in room_2. Satisfies constraint 9.

Now, the final goal is to be in front of green_door_1 (which is green) and have it unlocked. Since we already unlocked green_door_1 in step 6, and it's in room_4 and room_2. So we can be in front of it from room_2 or room_4. Let's go to room_2 and goto door green_door_1.

17. In room_2, gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4. Now in front of green_door_1, which is unlocked. This satisfies the goal.

Now, check all constraints:

- yellow_door_2 is locked in initial state, which is covered.

- After that, yellow_door_1 is unlocked in step 8, so the condition for constraint 2 is met.

- In step 3, in front of red_box_1.

- green_door_1 is unlocked in step 6.

- Before step 6, held blue_box_2 in step 4.

- Been in room_3 initially, which is covered.

- After initial room_3, in step 3, in front of red_box_1.

- Held blue_box_2 in step 4.

- yellow_door_1 unlocked in step 8.

- blue_ball_1 moved to room_2 in step 16.

So this seems to satisfy all constraints. Now, let's check the steps:

But wait, the plan needs to end with being in front of green_door_1 (d is green, you're in front of it, and it's not locked). So after step 17, which is in room_2, gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4. Then you are in front of green_door_1, which is unlocked. That's the goal. Then the plan is complete.

But let's count the steps:

1. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_3 room_4

2. toggle yellow_door_2

3. gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_2

4. gotoobject red_box_1 room_4

5. pick blue_box_2 room_4

6. drop blue_box_2 room_4

7. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2

8. toggle green_door_1

9. gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_1

10. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_1

11. toggle yellow_door_1

12. gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1

13. gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_2

14. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1

15. toggle grey_door_1

16. gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1

17. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2

18. gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1

19. drop blue_ball_1 room_2

20. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4

But this is very long. Maybe there's a shorter path.

Alternative approach: Use room_4 to unlock green_door_1, and use the fact that we need to hold blue_box_2.

Let's try to condense steps:

1. In room_3, goto yellow_door_2, unlock it, go to room_4.

2. In room_4, pick up blue_box_2 (hold it), then drop it.

3. goto green_door_1 in room_4, toggle (unlock).

4. go to room_2 via green_door_1.

5. unlock yellow_door_1.

6. return to room_3 via grey_door_1 (unlock if needed), pick up blue_ball_1, take it to room_2.

7. Finally, go to green_door_1 in room_2 and be in front of it.

Wait, steps:

1. goto yellow_door_2 (room_3), toggle, unlock.

2. gotoroom to room_4.

3. goto red_box_1 (to satisfy the constraint when in room_3 earlier).

4. pick blue_box_2, drop it (to satisfy holding).

5. goto green_door_1 in room_4, toggle (unlock).

6. go to room_2.

7. goto yellow_door_1, toggle (unlock).

8. go to room_1 via yellow_door_1.

9. go to room_3 via grey_door_1 (needs unlocking? Initially locked. So need to toggle grey_door_1. But we are in room_1, so goto grey_door_1 from room_1? Wait, grey_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3. So from room_1, gotodoor grey_door_1, toggle to unlock.

Then go to room_3, pick blue_ball_1, take it to room_1, then to room_2 via yellow_door_1 (now unlocked), drop it.

Then, goto green_door_1 in room_2.

This seems possible. Let's outline:

1. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_3 room_4

2. toggle yellow_door_2 (unlock)

3. gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_2

4. gotoobject red_box_1 room_4

5. pick blue_box_2 room_4

6. drop blue_box_2 room_4

7. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2

8. toggle green_door_1 (unlock)

9. gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_1

10. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_1

11. toggle yellow_door_1 (unlock)

12. gotoroom room_2 room_1 yellow_door_1

13. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_3

14. toggle grey_door_1 (unlock)

15. gotoroom room_1 room_3 grey_door_1

16. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_3

17. pick blue_ball_1 room_3

18. gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1

19. gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1

20. drop blue_ball_1 room_2

21. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4

22. (now in front of green_door_1, which is unlocked)

This satisfies all constraints. But is this the shortest path? Let's see if steps can be optimized.

For example, after step 9 (in room_2), can we go directly to room_3 via some path? Not unless doors are unlocked. To get back to room_3 from room_2, need to go through room_1 (unlocking doors) or room_4 (already unlocked green_door_1). Alternatively, from room_2, go to room_4 via green_door_1, then to room_3 via yellow_door_2. But then, in room_3, pick up blue_ball_1 and take it to room_2 via room_4 and green_door_1. This might be shorter.

Alternative path after step 9 (in room_2):

10. gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1

11. gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_2

12. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_3, pick it up.

13. gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_2

14. gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_1

15. drop blue_ball_1 room_2

16. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4

This way, steps 10-16 replace steps 10-20 in the previous plan. So let's see:

1. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_3 room_4

2. toggle yellow_door_2

3. gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_2

4. gotoobject red_box_1 room_4

5. pick blue_box_2 room_4

6. drop blue_box_2 room_4

7. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2

8. toggle green_door_1

9. gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_1

10. gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1

11. gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_2

12. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_3

13. pick blue_ball_1 room_3

14. gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_2

15. gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_1

16. drop blue_ball_1 room_2

17. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4

Now, in step 17, we're in front of green_door_1, which is unlocked. This plan has 17 steps. Also, in step 10, we need to unlock yellow_door_1 (constraint 8). Wait, no, in this path, we didn't unlock yellow_door_1. Because step 8 unlocks green_door_1, but constraint 8 requires yellow_door_1 to be unlocked. So this approach misses unlocking yellow_door_1. So we need to include that.

So after step 9 (in room_2), need to unlock yellow_door_1. So step 10: goto yellow_door_1 in room_2, toggle to unlock.

But to unlock yellow_door_1, need to be in front of it. So:

10. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_1

11. toggle yellow_door_1

Now, yellow_door_1 is unlocked. Then proceed to room_4.

But this adds steps. So the plan must include unlocking yellow_door_1.

So perhaps the optimized plan is:

1. goto yellow_door_2, unlock, go to room4.

2. goto red_box_1.

3. pick and drop blue_box_2.

4. unlock green_door_1.

5. go to room2, unlock yellow_door_1.

6. go back to room3 via room4, pick blue_ball_1.

7. take it to room2 via room4 and green_door_1.

8. be in front of green_door_1.

This way, all constraints are met.

Now, let's write the step-by-step actions:

1. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_3 room_4

2. toggle yellow_door_2

3. gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_2

4. gotoobject red_box_1 room_4

5. pick blue_box_2 room_4

6. drop blue_box_2 room_4

7. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2

8. toggle green_door_1

9. gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_1

10. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_1

11. toggle yellow_door_1

12. gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1

13. gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_2

14. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_3

15. pick blue_ball_1 room_3

16. gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_2

17. gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_1

18. drop blue_ball_1 room_2

19. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4

Now, step 19 is in front of green_door_1, which is green and unlocked. This satisfies the goal. All constraints are checked:

- yellow_door_2 is locked in initial state (step 0), satisfies constraint.

- yellow_door_1 is unlocked in step 11, so the constraint for yellow_door_2 being locked (initial state) is met because yellow_door_1 is unlocked after.

- green_box_1 is in room4, we goto it? No, wait, step 4 is red_box_1. Oh right, constraint 3 requires being in front of green_box_1. So this plan misses that. Oops, I forgot that step.

So in room4, after step 3, need to gotoobject green_box_1 room4. So insert:

4. gotoobject green_box_1 room_4

Then step5: pick blue_box_2, etc.

So revised steps:

1. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_3 room_4

2. toggle yellow_door_2

3. gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_2

4. gotoobject green_box_1 room_4

5. gotoobject red_box_1 room_4

6. pick blue_box_2 room_4

7. drop blue_box_2 room_4

8. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2

9. toggle green_door_1

10. gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_1

11. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_1

12. toggle yellow_door_1

13. gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1

14. gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_2

15. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_3

16. pick blue_ball_1 room_3

17. gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_2

18. gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_1

19. drop blue_ball_1 room_2

20. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4

Now, step4 satisfies being in front of green_box_1. Also, step5 in front of red_box_1.

This now covers all constraints. This plan has 20 steps. But maybe some steps can be optimized. For example, after step4 (green_box_1), goto red_box_1 directly if possible. But each gotoobject requires being in the same room, which they are.

But perhaps after step3, you can go to green_box_1, then to red_box_1, then pick blue_box_2. But how to optimize further?

Alternatively, after step3, do:

4. gotoobject green_box_1 room_4

5. gotoempty (to not be in front of anything)

6. gotoobject red_box_1 room_4

But each gotoobject requires moving. But the important thing is to have been in front of green_box_1 and red_box_1. So step4 and step5.

Alternatively, after step3, goto green_box_1, then pick blue_box_2 (but blue_box_2 is in room_4). So step4: goto green_box_1, step5: goto blue_box_2, pick it up.

Wait, blue_box_2 is in room_4. So maybe:

1. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room3 room4

2. toggle

3. goto room4

4. goto green_box_1 room4

5. goto blue_box_2 room4

6. pick blue_box_2

7. drop it

8. goto red_box_1 room4

But steps must be sequential. Each action is separate.

Alternatively:

After step3:

4. gotoobject green_box_1 room4 (satisfies constraint3)

5. gotoempty

6. gotoobject red_box_1 room4 (satisfies constraint related to being in room3 earlier)

7. pick blue_box_2 room4

8. drop blue_box_2 room4

9. proceed to unlock green_door_1.

This would add steps but ensure all constraints are met.

But in any case, the plan must include these steps. It's possible that this is the minimal plan given the constraints. I'll proceed to write the final answer as per the steps outlined.
