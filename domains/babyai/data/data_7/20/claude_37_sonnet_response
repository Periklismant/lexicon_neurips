Alright, I need to analyze the problem step by step to come up with a valid plan. Let me first understand the layout of the world and the constraints that need to be satisfied.

**Initial State:**
- I am in room_3
- purple_ball_1 is in room_1
- yellow_ball_1 is in room_2
- blue_box_1, blue_ball_1, yellow_box_1 are in room_3
- green_box_1, blue_box_2, red_box_1 are in room_4
- All doors (yellow_door_1, grey_door_1, green_door_1, yellow_door_2) are locked
- I have only visited room_3 so far

**Goal:**
- Find a door d such that: d is green, I am in front of d, and d is not locked

From the given objects, I can see that green_door_1 is the only green door. So my goal is to be in front of green_door_1 when it's unlocked.

**Constraints:**
1. At some point, yellow_door_2 must be locked (initially it is, so this is already satisfied)
2. After yellow_door_2 is locked, at some point either yellow_door_1 must be unlocked or blue_box_1 must be in room_2
3. At some point, I must be in front of green_box_1
4. At some point, green_door_1 must be unlocked
5. Before green_door_1 is unlocked, I must have been holding some object
6. At some point, I must be in room_3 (already satisfied in the initial state)
7. After being in room_3, I must at some point be in front of red_box_1
8. At some point, I must be holding blue_box_2
9. At some point, yellow_door_1 must be unlocked
10. At some point, blue_ball_1 must be in room_2

Now let's plan the sequence of actions to satisfy all of these constraints and achieve the goal.

From the room layout, I know:
- room_1 (NW) is connected to room_2 (SW) via yellow_door_1
- room_1 (NW) is connected to room_3 (NE) via grey_door_1
- room_2 (SW) is connected to room_4 (SE) via green_door_1
- room_3 (NE) is connected to room_4 (SE) via yellow_door_2

I start in room_3. I need to:
1. Get to room_4 (to get blue_box_2 and also to see green_box_1 and red_box_1)
2. Go back to room_3, pick up blue_ball_1, and move it to room_2
3. Unlock yellow_door_1 and green_door_1
4. End up in front of green_door_1 when it's unlocked

Let me plan step by step:

1. First, I need to unlock yellow_door_2 to get from room_3 to room_4
2. I'll go to yellow_door_2, toggle it, and go to room_4
3. In room_4, I'll go in front of green_box_1 (satisfying constraint 3)
4. I'll go in front of red_box_1 (part of constraint 7)
5. I'll go to blue_box_2 and pick it up (working on constraint 8)
6. I'll go back to room_3 via yellow_door_2
7. I'll drop blue_box_2 in room_3
8. Since I've held an object, I can now unlock green_door_1 later (for constraint 5)
9. I need to go to room_1 via grey_door_1, so I'll go to it and toggle it
10. I'll go to room_1
11. Now I'll go to yellow_door_1 and toggle it (for constraint 9)
12. I'll go to room_2
13. Now I need to go back to room_3 to get blue_ball_1
14. I'll go back to room_1 via yellow_door_1
15. Then go to room_3 via grey_door_1
16. Go to blue_ball_1, pick it up
17. Go back to room_1 via grey_door_1
18. Go to room_2 via yellow_door_1
19. Drop blue_ball_1 in room_2 (satisfying constraint 10)
20. Now I need to get to green_door_1 and unlock it
21. Go to green_door_1 and toggle it
22. Now I'm in front of green_door_1, it's green, and it's unlocked (satisfying the goal)

But wait, there's a problem with this plan. Constraint 2 says that after yellow_door_2 is locked, I need to either unlock yellow_door_1 or move blue_box_1 to room_2. In my plan, I unlock yellow_door_2 at the beginning. I could lock it again later, but then I'd need to satisfy one of those conditions.

Actually, if I reread the constraint:
"If expression 'yellow_door_2 is locked' holds in some state s, then expression 'At least one of the following conditions is true: 'yellow_door_1 is not locked', 'blue_box_1 is in room_2'' must hold at s or at some state after s"

This is saying that any time yellow_door_2 is locked, one of those two conditions must be true at that time or later. Since yellow_door_2 is initially locked, I need to ensure one of those conditions is met either in the initial state or at some point after.

Let me revise my plan:

1. First, I'll unlock grey_door_1 to get from room_3 to room_1
2. From room_1, I'll unlock yellow_door_1 (satisfying part of constraint 2)
3. Now I'll go to room_2
4. From room_2, I'll unlock green_door_1
5. I'll go to room_4
6. In room_4, I'll go in front of green_box_1 and red_box_1 (satisfying constraints 3 and 7)
7. I'll pick up blue_box_2 (satisfying constraint 8)
8. I'll go back to room_2
9. I'll go to room_1
10. I'll go to room_3
11. I'll go to blue_ball_1, pick it up
12. I'll go back to room_1
13. I'll go to room_2
14. I'll drop blue_ball_1 (satisfying constraint 10)
15. I'll go to green_door_1
16. I've now satisfied all constraints and am at the goal

Actually, as I think about it more, I realize another issue. Constraint 5 says that before green_door_1 is unlocked, I must have been holding some object. So I need to pick up an object before unlocking green_door_1. Let me revise again:

1. I start in room_3
2. I go to blue_ball_1 and pick it up (now I've held an object)
3. I go to grey_door_1 and toggle it
4. I go to room_1
5. I go to yellow_door_1 and toggle it (satisfying constraint 9)
6. I go to room_2
7. I drop blue_ball_1 in room_2 (satisfying constraint 10)
8. I go to green_door_1 and toggle it (I've held an object before, satisfying constraint 5)
9. Now I'm in front of green_door_1, it's green, and it's unlocked (satisfying the goal and constraint 4)

But I'm not sure if this satisfies all constraints. Let's check:

1. At some point, yellow_door_2 is locked - YES (initially)
2. After yellow_door_2 is locked, at some point yellow_door_1 is unlocked - YES (steps 5-6)
3. At some point, I am in front of green_box_1 - MISSING
4. At some point, green_door_1 is unlocked - YES (step 8)
5. Before green_door_1 is unlocked, I have held some object - YES (step 2)
6. At some point, I am in room_3 - YES (initially)
7. After being in room_3, I am in front of red_box_1 - MISSING
8. At some point, I hold blue_box_2 - MISSING
9. At some point, yellow_door_1 is unlocked - YES (step 5)
10. At some point, blue_ball_1 is in room_2 - YES (step 7)

I'm missing constraints 3, 7, and 8. Let me revise the plan again:

1. I start in room_3
2. I go to blue_ball_1 and pick it up
3. I go to yellow_door_2 and toggle it
4. I go to room_4
5. I go in front of green_box_1 (satisfying constraint 3)
6. I go in front of red_box_1 (satisfying constraint 7)
7. I go to blue_box_2 and drop blue_ball_1 (to free my hands)
8. I go to blue_box_2 and pick it up (satisfying constraint 8)
9. I go to yellow_door_2 and toggle it (locking it again)
10. Now that yellow_door_2 is locked again, I need to satisfy constraint 2 by either unlocking yellow_door_1
11. I go to grey_door_1 and toggle it
12. I go to room_1
13. I go to yellow_door_1 and toggle it (satisfying constraint 9, and part of constraint 2)
14. I go to room_2
15. I drop blue_box_2 (to free my hands)
16. I go to room_1
17. I go to room_3
18. I go to blue_ball_1 and pick it up
19. I go to room_1
20. I go to room_2
21. I drop blue_ball_1 (satisfying constraint 10)
22. I go to green_door_1 and toggle it (I've held objects before, satisfying constraint 5)
23. Now I'm in front of green_door_1, it's green, and it's unlocked (satisfying the goal and constraint 4)

Wait, there's a mistake in my plan. I can't drop blue_ball_1 in step 7 because I don't have it at that point anymore (I dropped it in step 7). Let me redo this.

1. I start in room_3
2. I go to blue_ball_1 and pick it up
3. I go to yellow_door_2 and toggle it
4. I go to room_4
5. I go in front of green_box_1 (satisfying constraint 3)
6. I go in front of red_box_1 (satisfying constraint 7)
7. I use gotoempty to go to an empty position
8. I drop blue_ball_1 (to free my hands)
9. I go to blue_box_2 and pick it up (satisfying constraint 8)
10. I go to yellow_door_2 and toggle it (locking it again)
11. Now that yellow_door_2 is locked again, I need to satisfy constraint 2 by either unlocking yellow_door_1
12. I go to grey_door_1 and toggle it
13. I go to room_1
14. I go to yellow_door_1 and toggle it (satisfying constraint 9, and part of constraint 2)
15. I go to room_2
16. I drop blue_box_2 (to free my hands)
17. I go to green_door_1 and toggle it (I've held objects before, satisfying constraint 5)
18. Now I'm in front of green_door_1, it's green, and it's unlocked (satisfying the goal and constraint 4)

Wait, I'm still not satisfying constraint 10 - blue_ball_1 needs to be in room_2 at some point. Let me redo this:

1. I start in room_3
2. I go to blue_ball_1 and pick it up
3. I go to grey_door_1 and toggle it
4. I go to room_1
5. I go to yellow_door_1 and toggle it (satisfying constraint 9)
6. I go to room_2
7. I drop blue_ball_1 (satisfying constraint 10)
8. I go to room_1
9. I go to room_3
10. I go to yellow_door_2 and toggle it
11. I go to room_4
12. I go in front of green_box_1 (satisfying constraint 3)
13. I go in front of red_box_1 (satisfying constraint 7)
14. I go to blue_box_2 and pick it up (satisfying constraint 8)
15. I go to yellow_door_2 (it's unlocked)
16. I toggle yellow_door_2 (locking it again)
17. Now that yellow_door_2 is locked again, I've already unlocked yellow_door_1 (satisfying constraint 2)
18. I go to green_door_1 and toggle it (I've held objects before, satisfying constraint 5)
19. Now I'm in front of green_door_1, it's green, and it's unlocked (satisfying the goal and constraint 4)

Oops, I can't go to yellow_door_2 in step 15 because I'm in room_4, not room_3. Let me correct:

1. I start in room_3
2. I go to blue_ball_1 and pick it up
3. I go to grey_door_1 and toggle it
4. I go to room_1
5. I go to yellow_door_1 and toggle it (satisfying constraint 9)
6. I go to room_2
7. I drop blue_ball_1 (satisfying constraint 10)
8. I go to room_1
9. I go to room_3
10. I go to yellow_door_2 and toggle it
11. I go to room_4
12. I go in front of green_box_1 (satisfying constraint 3)
13. I go in front of red_box_1 (satisfying constraint 7)
14. I go to blue_box_2 and pick it up (satisfying constraint 8)
15. I go to green_door_1
16. I toggle green_door_1 (I've held objects before, satisfying constraint 5)
17. Now I'm in front of green_door_1, it's green, and it's unlocked (satisfying the goal and constraint 4)

Wait, I forgot constraint 2. Let me check:
"If expression 'yellow_door_2 is locked' holds in some state s, then expression 'At least one of the following conditions is true: 'yellow_door_1 is not locked', 'blue_box_1 is in room_2'' must hold at s or at some state after s"

In the initial state, yellow_door_2 is locked, so I need to ensure that either yellow_door_1 is unlocked or blue_box_1 is in room_2 at some point. In my plan, I unlock yellow_door_1 in step 5, which satisfies this constraint.

But let me double-check all constraints:

1. At some point, yellow_door_2 is locked - YES (initially)
2. After yellow_door_2 is locked, yellow_door_1 is unlocked - YES (step 5)
3. At some point, I am in front of green_box_1 - YES (step 12)
4. At some point, green_door_1 is unlocked - YES (step 16)
5. Before green_door_1 is unlocked, I have held some object - YES (steps 2, 14)
6. At some point, I am in room_3 - YES (initially)
7. After being in room_3, I am in front of red_box_1 - YES (step 13)
8. At some point, I hold blue_box_2 - YES (step 14)
9. At some point, yellow_door_1 is unlocked - YES (step 5)
10. At some point, blue_ball_1 is in room_2 - YES (step 7)

It looks like this plan satisfies all constraints. Let me now write out the full sequence of actions:

1. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_3
2. pick blue_ball_1 room_3
3. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1
4. toggle grey_door_1
5. gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1
6. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2
7. toggle yellow_door_1
8. gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1
9. gotoempty
10. drop blue_ball_1 room_2
11. gotoroom room_2 room_1 yellow_door_1
12. gotoroom room_1 room_3 grey_door_1
13. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_3 room_4
14. toggle yellow_door_2
15. gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_2
16. gotoobject green_box_1 room_4
17. gotoobject red_box_1 room_4
18. gotoobject blue_box_2 room_4
19. pick blue_box_2 room_4
20. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2
21. toggle green_door_1
22. (I'm now in front of green_door_1, it's green, and it's unlocked - goal achieved)

Actually, I'm noticing that I don't have any way to make yellow_door_2 be locked again after unlocking it. Let me go through the plan more carefully:

1. I start in room_3
2. I go to blue_ball_1 and pick it up
3. I go to grey_door_1 and toggle it
4. I go to room_1
5. I go to yellow_door_1 and toggle it (satisfying constraint 9)
6. I go to room_2
7. I drop blue_ball_1 (satisfying constraint 10)
8. I go to room_1
9. I go to room_3
10. I go to yellow_door_2 and toggle it
11. I go to room_4
12. I go in front of green_box_1 (satisfying constraint 3)
13. I go in front of red_box_1 (satisfying constraint 7)
14. I go to blue_box_2 and pick it up (satisfying constraint 8)
15. I go to yellow_door_2
16. I toggle yellow_door_2 (locking it again, satisfying constraint 1 again)
17. I go to green_door_1
18. I toggle green_door_1 (I've held objects before, satisfying constraint 5)
19. Now I'm in front of green_door_1, it's green, and it's unlocked (satisfying the goal and constraint 4)

Wait, there's another issue - in step 15, I can't go to yellow_door_2 while in room_4 because I need to specify which room is on the other side. Let me correct:

1. I start in room_3
2. I go to blue_ball_1 and pick it up
3. I go to grey_door_1 and toggle it
4. I go to room_1
5. I go to yellow_door_1 and toggle it (satisfying constraint 9)
6. I go to room_2
7. I drop blue_ball_1 (satisfying constraint 10)
8. I go to room_1
9. I go to room_3
10. I go to yellow_door_2 and toggle it
11. I go to room_4
12. I go in front of green_box_1 (satisfying constraint 3)
13. I go in front of red_box_1 (satisfying constraint 7)
14. I go to blue_box_2 and pick it up (satisfying constraint 8)
15. I go back to room_3 via yellow_door_2
16. I go to yellow_door_2 and toggle it (locking it again, satisfying constraint 1 again)
17. I go back to room_4 via yellow_door_2 (wait, this is a problem - I just locked the door!)

I'm running into issues with the plan. Let me think this through more carefully. I need to:

1. Find a way to bring blue_ball_1 to room_2
2. Find a way to be in front of green_box_1 and red_box_1 in room_4
3. Find a way to hold blue_box_2
4. Make sure yellow_door_1 is unlocked at some point
5. Make sure green_door_1 is unlocked at some point
6. Make sure yellow_door_2 is locked at some point (it is initially)
7. End up in front of green_door_1 when it's unlocked

Let me restart the plan:

1. I start in room_3
2. I go to blue_ball_1 and pick it up
3. I go to grey_door_1 and toggle it
4. I go to room_1
5. I go to yellow_door_1 and toggle it (satisfying constraint 9)
6. I go to room_2
7. I drop blue_ball_1 (satisfying constraint 10)
8. I go to green_door_1 and toggle it (satisfying constraint 5)
9. I go to room_4
10. I go in front of green_box_1 (satisfying constraint 3)
11. I go in front of red_box_1 (satisfying constraint 7)
12. I go to blue_box_2 and pick it up (satisfying constraint 8)
13. I go to green_door_1
14. (I'm now in front of green_door_1, it's green, and it's unlocked - goal achieved)

Let me check all constraints:

1. At some point, yellow_door_2 is locked - YES (initially)
2. After yellow_door_2 is locked, yellow_door_1 is unlocked - YES (step 5)
3. At some point, I am in front of green_box_1 - YES (step 10)
4. At some point, green_door_1 is unlocked - YES (step 8)
5. Before green_door_1 is unlocked, I have held some object - YES (step 2)
6. At some point, I am in room_3 - YES (initially)
7. After being in room_3, I am in front of red_box_1 - YES (step 11)
8. At some point, I hold blue_box_2 - YES (step 12)
9. At some point, yellow_door_1 is unlocked - YES (step 5)
10. At some point, blue_ball_1 is in room_2 - YES (step 7)

Alright, this plan seems to satisfy all constraints. Let me now write out the complete sequence of actions:

1. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_3
2. pick blue_ball_1 room_3
3. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1
4. toggle grey_door_1
5. gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1
6. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2
7. toggle yellow_door_1
8. gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1
9. gotoempty
10. drop blue_ball_1 room_2
11. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4
12. toggle green_door_1
13. gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1
14. gotoobject green_box_1 room_4
15. gotoobject red_box_1 room_4
16. gotoobject blue_box_2 room_4
17. pick blue_box_2 room_4
18. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2
19. (I'm now in front of green_door_1, it's green, and it's unlocked - goal achieved)

Actually, on review, I think I should drop the blue_box_2 before the plan ends, because otherwise the statement "I'm in front of green_door_1" might not be true if I'm still holding blue_box_2. But that's maybe overthinking it.

Let me do a final check of my plan:

1. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_3 - I go to blue_ball_1 in room_3
2. pick blue_ball_1 room_3 - I pick up blue_ball_1
3. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1 - I go to grey_door_1
4. toggle grey_door_1 - I unlock grey_door_1
5. gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1 - I go to room_1
6. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2 - I go to yellow_door_1
7. toggle yellow_door_1 - I unlock yellow_door_1 (satisfying constraint 9)
8. gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1 - I go to room_2
9. gotoempty - I go to an empty position
10. drop blue_ball_1 room_2 - I drop blue_ball_1 in room_2 (satisfying constraint 10)
11. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4 - I go to green_door_1
12. toggle green_door_1 - I unlock green_door_1 (satisfying constraint 4, with constraint 5 satisfied because I held blue_ball_1)
13. gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1 - I go to room_4
14. gotoobject green_box_1 room_4 - I go to green_box_1 (satisfying constraint 3)
15. gotoobject red_box_1 room_4 - I go to red_box_1 (satisfying constraint 7)
16. gotoobject blue_box_2 room_4 - I go to blue_box_2
17. pick blue_box_2 room_4 - I pick up blue_box_2 (satisfying constraint 8)
18. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2 - I go to green_door_1

At this point, I am in front of green_door_1, green_door_1 is green, and green_door_1 is unlocked, satisfying the goal. Let's check all constraints:

1. At some point, yellow_door_2 is locked - YES (initially)
2. After yellow_door_2 is locked, at some point yellow_door_1 is unlocked - YES (step 7)
3. At some point, I am in front of green_box_1 - YES (step 14)
4. At some point, green_door_1 is unlocked - YES (step 12)
5. Before green_door_1 is unlocked, I have held some object - YES (steps 2-11)
6. At some point, I am in room_3 - YES (initially)
7. After being in room_3, at some point I am in front of red_box_1 - YES (step 15)
8. At some point, I hold blue_box_2 - YES (step 17)
9. At some point, yellow_door_1 is unlocked - YES (step 7)
10. At some point, blue_ball_1 is in room_2 - YES (step 10)

So this plan satisfies all constraints and achieves the goal.

Let me review my logic one more time. The two trickiest constraints are:

Constraint 2: "If expression 'yellow_door_2 is locked' holds in some state s, then expression 'At least one of the following conditions is true: 'yellow_door_1 is not locked', 'blue_box_1 is in room_2'' must hold at s or at some state after s"

Initially, yellow_door_2 is locked, so I need to ensure that at some point, either yellow_door_1 is unlocked or blue_box_1 is in room_2. In my plan, I unlock yellow_door_1 in step 7, which satisfies this constraint.

Constraint 5: "If expression 'green_door_1 is not locked' holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: 'you are holding some object'"

I unlock green_door_1 in step 12, and I pick up blue_ball_1 in step 2, so this constraint is satisfied.

I'm satisfied with this plan. Let me finalize the sequence of actions:

1. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_3
2. pick blue_ball_1 room_3
3. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1
4. toggle grey_door_1
5. gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1
6. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2
7. toggle yellow_door_1
8. gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1
9. gotoempty
10. drop blue_ball_1 room_2
11. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4
12. toggle green_door_1
13. gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1
14. gotoobject green_box_1 room_4
15. gotoobject red_box_1 room_4
16. gotoobject blue_box_2 room_4
17. pick blue_box_2 room_4
18. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2

Actually, I think I'm not correctly interpreting the goal:
"There is a door d such that 'The following conditions are all true: 'd is green', 'you are in front of d', 'd is not locked'"

Given that the only green door is green_door_1, I think the goal is to be in front of green_door_1 when it's unlocked. I achieve this at step 18 in my plan, after unlocking green_door_1 in step 12.

Alright, I'm satisfied with this plan. It satisfies all constraints and achieves the goal of being in front of green_door_1 when it's unlocked.

Since the goal state has us in front of green_door_1 from room_4 (after step 18) and green_door_1 is unlocked (after step 12), this plan achieves the goal. The optimal plan length is 18 steps.

1. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_3
2. pick blue_ball_1 room_3
