Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. The goal is to have a grey box that I'm in front of. The constraints are quite a few, so I need to make sure each one is satisfied. Let's start by understanding the initial state and the goal.

Initial State:
- I'm in room_3.
- Objects in room_1: grey_ball_1 (grey), red_box_1 (red), green_ball_1 (green).
- Objects in room_2: grey_box_1 (grey), red_box_2 (red).
- Objects in room_3: blue_box_1 (blue), purple_box_1 (purple).
- Objects in room_4: grey_box_2 (grey).
- All doors are locked: purple_door_1 (purple), grey_door_1 (grey), red_door_1 (red), green_door_1 (green).

Goal:
- There exists a grey box (v) such that I'm in front of v.

Constraints:
1. Never enter room_4.
2. At some point, green_door_1 must be locked.
3. If green_door_1 is locked in a state, I must be holding red_box_1 at that state or later.
4. At some point, green_door_1 must be unlocked.
5. If green_door_1 is unlocked, I must have held red_box_1 earlier.
6. Be in front of red_box_1 at some point.
7. Be in room_3 at some point.
8. If in room_3, then either red_door_1 is unlocked or I'm holding something.
9. Hold grey_box_1 at some point.
10. Hold an object and be in front of red_box_2 at some point.

First, the goal requires a grey box in front of me. The grey boxes are grey_box_1 (room_2), grey_box_2 (room_4). But room_4 is off-limits due to constraint 1. So the target must be grey_box_1 in room_2.

To get to grey_box_1 in room_2, I need to move from room_3 to room_1 via grey_door_1, then to room_2 via purple_door_1. But all doors are locked. So I need to unlock doors.

But doors can be toggled (unlocked) only if I'm in front of them. So first, I need to go to the doors and toggle them.

Starting in room_3. The doors connected to room_3 are grey_door_1 (connecting to room_1) and green_door_1 (connecting to room_4). But green_door_1 leads to room_4, which we can't enter. So maybe go to grey_door_1 first.

Wait, but to go to a door, I need to be in a room connected by that door. For example, to go to grey_door_1 from room_3, I can use gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1. But the preconditions for gotodoor are that I'm in a room connected by the door, and no object is blocking the position in front of the door. So I need to check if there's any object blocking the door in room_3.

Looking at room_3's objects: blue_box_1 and purple_box_1. Are they blocking the doors? The problem statement says that objects may block doors. But the initial state doesn't mention any door being blocked. So maybe assuming doors are not blocked. So I can go to the doors.

So step 1: gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1. Then toggle it to unlock. But wait, the toggle action requires being in front of the door. So after going to the door, toggle it.

Wait, but initial doors are locked. So after going to grey_door_1, I can toggle it to unlock. Then, I can go to room_1 via gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1.

Once in room_1, then proceed to purple_door_1 connecting room_1 and room_2. But purple_door_1 is locked. So need to go to that door, toggle it.

But room_1 has objects: grey_ball_1, red_box_1, green_ball_1. Are any of these blocking the doors? Again, initial state doesn't say, so assuming not. So in room_1, I can go to purple_door_1 (gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2), toggle to unlock, then go to room_2 via gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1.

Once in room_2, I can gotoobject grey_box_1 room_2, then pick it up. But wait, the goal is to be in front of a grey box. So maybe just being in front of it is enough. But the goal says "there is a box v such that v is grey and you are in front of v". So the final state requires that I'm in front of a grey box, which can be grey_box_1 in room_2.

But to get there, I need to navigate through doors, unlock them, etc. Let's outline the steps:

1. From room_3, go to grey_door_1 (gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1)
2. Toggle grey_door_1 to unlock.
3. Go to room_1 via grey_door_1.
4. In room_1, go to purple_door_1 (gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2)
5. Toggle purple_door_1 to unlock.
6. Go to room_2 via purple_door_1.
7. In room_2, gotoobject grey_box_1 room_2. Now in front of grey_box_1, which satisfies the goal.

But wait, the constraints must be satisfied as well. Let's check each constraint:

Constraint 1: Never enter room_4. So avoid using green_door_1. That's okay.

Constraint 2: At some state, green_door_1 is locked. Initially, it's locked. So in the initial state, that's true. But the problem says "in at least one state". However, if we toggle it, we have to ensure that at some point it's locked again. But according to the initial state, green_door_1 is locked. So unless we unlock it, it remains locked. But constraint 4 requires that at some state, green_door_1 is not locked. So we need to unlock it and then perhaps lock it again. Wait, the constraints:

Constraint 2: green_door_1 is locked in some state. Which is already true initially. But after that, if we unlock it, then we need to lock it again to satisfy constraint 2. But constraint 4 says it must be unlocked in at least one state. So we need to unlock it once, and then maybe lock it again. But constraint 3 says that if green_door_1 is locked in some state, then we must be holding red_box_1 at that state or after. So if we lock it again, we need to have red_box_1.

But in the initial state, green_door_1 is locked. So constraint 2 is already satisfied. Wait, but the problem says "must hold in at least one state". So if we never touch green_door_1, then it's locked throughout. So constraint 2 is satisfied by the initial state. However, constraint 4 requires that green_door_1 is not locked in at least one state. So we need to toggle it to unlock it at some point. Then, if we lock it again, constraint 3 would require that we hold red_box_1 at that time or later.

But the problem is that we need to unlock green_door_1 at some point (to satisfy constraint 4), but then if we lock it again, we must have red_box_1. But perhaps we can unlock it once, and leave it unlocked. But then constraint 2 is satisfied by the initial state, constraint 4 by the state after unlocking. But constraint 5 says that if green_door_1 is not locked in some state, then there must be an earlier state where we held red_box_1.

So, to unlock green_door_1 (to satisfy constraint 4), we need to have held red_box_1 before that.

But how can we hold red_box_1? red_box_1 is in room_1. So we need to go to room_1, pick it up. But to get to room_1, we need to unlock grey_door_1. Then, go to room_1, pick red_box_1, then go to green_door_1 (which is in room_3 and room_4?), but we can't go to room_4. Wait, green_door_1 connects room_3 and room_4. So to access green_door_1, we need to be in room_3 or room_4. But room_4 is off-limits. So we can only access green_door_1 from room_3.

But in the initial state, we are in room_3. So maybe:

After unlocking grey_door_1 and purple_door_1, go to room_2, get grey_box_1. But that's the goal. But to satisfy the other constraints, perhaps need to involve green_door_1.

Alternatively, perhaps the plan needs to include toggling green_door_1. Let's think.

To satisfy constraint 4, green_door_1 must be unlocked at some point. So we need to toggle it from locked to unlocked. But we are in room_3 initially. So in room_3, we can go to green_door_1 (gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4). Then toggle it. That would unlock it, satisfying constraint 4. But then, according to constraint 5, if green_door_1 is not locked (i.e., after we unlocked it), we must have held red_box_1 in an earlier state.

So before unlocking green_door_1, we need to have held red_box_1.

So steps would involve:

1. From room_3, go to grey_door_1 and unlock it.
2. Go to room_1.
3. Pick up red_box_1.
4. Return to room_3 via grey_door_1.
5. Go to green_door_1 in room_3, unlock it (now green_door_1 is unlocked, satisfying constraint 4).
6. Then, perhaps lock it again (but to satisfy constraint 3, if we lock it again, we need to hold red_box_1 at that time or later. But if we already have red_box_1, then it's okay. But after unlocking, we might have to drop red_box_1 somewhere, but need to check constraints.

Alternatively, after unlocking green_door_1 (step 5), we can proceed to lock it again, but only if we are holding red_box_1. But if we are holding red_box_1 when we lock it, then constraint 3 is satisfied.

But let's outline:

- To get red_box_1, need to be in room_1. To get to room_1, unlock grey_door_1.

So steps:

1. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1
2. toggle grey_door_1 (unlocks it)
3. gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1 (now in room_1)
4. gotoobject red_box_1 room_1
5. pick red_box_1 room_1 (now holding red_box_1)
6. Now, need to go back to room_3 to access green_door_1.
7. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_3
8. gotoroom room_1 room_3 grey_door_1 (back to room_3)
9. gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4
10. toggle green_door_1 (unlocks it) → now constraint 4 is satisfied (green_door_1 is not locked)
11. Now, constraint 5 requires that before this state, we held red_box_1. Which we did in step 5.

Then, perhaps we need to lock it again to satisfy constraint 2 (but constraint 2 is already satisfied by the initial state). But maybe not necessary. However, if we toggle it again (lock it), then in that state, green_door_1 is locked, and according to constraint 3, we must be holding red_box_1 at that time or later. Since we are holding red_box_1 in step 5, but after that, if we drop it, then when we lock green_door_1 again, we need to have held red_box_1 either at that state or after. But if we lock it again after step 10, we need to ensure that we are holding red_box_1 at that time or later.

Wait, after step 10, green_door_1 is unlocked. Then, if we lock it again (toggle), then in that state (locked), we must have held red_box_1 in that state or later. But if we are holding red_box_1 when we lock it, then it's okay. But in step 5, we picked red_box_1, and in step 10, we're still holding it? No, because to perform other actions like gotoroom or gotoobject, we need to have our hands free. Wait, the "pick" action requires that we are not holding anything. Once we pick up red_box_1, we are holding it. But to perform other actions like "gotoroom", we can still do that while holding the object. The "gotoroom" action's preconditions don't mention holding an object. So after picking red_box_1 in step 5, we can carry it to room_3.

So steps 5-8: holding red_box_1.

Then, in step 9-10: still holding red_box_1. So when we toggle green_door_1 in step 10, we are holding red_box_1. Then, if we toggle it again (lock), we are still holding red_box_1, satisfying constraint 3.

But why would we need to lock it again? Because constraint 2 says that green_door_1 must be locked in some state. The initial state already satisfies that. However, if we unlocked it in step 10, and then lock it again, then the final state may have green_door_1 locked or unlocked. But the constraints don't require it to be locked in the final state, just that it was locked in some state (which is already true initially). So perhaps we don't need to lock it again. However, the problem says "a valid plan must abide by the constraints". The constraints are:

Constraint 2: At least one state has green_door_1 locked. Initial state satisfies this.

Constraint 4: At least one state has green_door_1 not locked. Our step 10 satisfies this.

Constraint 3: If green_door_1 is locked in some state s, then in s or after, we must be holding red_box_1. Since in the initial state, green_door_1 is locked, but we have not held red_box_1 yet. So constraint 3 is violated unless in some state after the initial state, when green_door_1 is locked, we are holding red_box_1.

Wait, this is a problem. Because in the initial state, green_door_1 is locked, but we are not holding red_box_1. So the constraint says that if in any state s (including the initial state) green_door_1 is locked, then in s or after, we must hold red_box_1.

So the initial state violates this constraint unless we later hold red_box_1. Because in the initial state, green_door_1 is locked, but we are not holding red_box_1. Therefore, the plan must include a state where green_door_1 is locked (could be the initial state or later) and in that state or a subsequent one, we hold red_box_1.

But in the initial state, the constraint is not met because green_door_1 is locked, and we are not holding red_box_1. Therefore, to satisfy constraint 3, we must hold red_box_1 at some point after the initial state. Which we do when we pick it up in step 5. So even if green_door_1 is locked in the initial state, as long as we later hold red_box_1, the constraint is satisfied. Because the constraint says "in s or at some state after s". So for the initial state s0 where green_door_1 is locked, we need to have in s0 or after, holding red_box_1. Since in step 5, we hold it, that's after s0, so constraint 3 is satisfied.

So perhaps we don't need to lock green_door_1 again. But we do need to unlock it once (step 10) to satisfy constraint 4.

Now, after step 10, green_door_1 is unlocked, which is required by constraint 4. And the unlocking was done after holding red_box_1 (step 5), satisfying constraint 5.

Now, proceeding to the main goal: getting in front of a grey box. The available grey boxes are grey_box_1 (room_2) and grey_box_2 (room_4, which is forbidden). So target is grey_box_1 in room_2.

From step 10, we are in room_3, in front of green_door_1, holding red_box_1. But to get to room_2, we need to go via room_1 and purple_door_1.

But currently, we are in room_3. To go to room_1, we can use grey_door_1 (already unlocked). Then go to room_1, then unlock purple_door_1, then go to room_2.

But we are holding red_box_1. To unlock purple_door_1, we need to go to it, toggle it. But if we are holding red_box_1, can we toggle doors? The toggle action's precondition is being in front of the door. Holding an object doesn't prevent that. So yes.

So steps after step 10:

11. gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1 (back to room_1, still holding red_box_1)
12. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2
13. toggle purple_door_1 (unlock it)
14. gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1 (now in room_2)
15. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_2
16. Now, in front of grey_box_1. Need to drop red_box_1? Because the goal is to be in front of a grey box. But if we are holding red_box_1, can we be in front of grey_box_1? Yes, because "gotoobject" just positions us in front of it, regardless of holding.

Wait, the "gotoobject" action's effect is that you are in front of the object. So step 15 puts us in front of grey_box_1. Then, the goal is satisfied. But do we need to drop red_box_1? Not necessarily. The goal doesn't require holding or not holding.

But other constraints may require us to drop it. Let's check.

Constraint 9: must hold grey_box_1 at some point. So we need to pick it up. But the plan so far hasn't done that. So after step 15, we need to pick up grey_box_1.

But wait, constraint 9 requires that at some state, we are holding grey_box_1. So after step 15 (in front of grey_box_1), we can pick it up. But we are currently holding red_box_1. To pick up grey_box_1, we need to drop red_box_1 first.

But dropping requires being in front of an empty position. So:

16. gotoempty (moves to empty spot)
17. drop red_box_1 room_2 (now holding nothing)
18. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_2
19. pick grey_box_1 room_2 (now holding grey_box_1, satisfying constraint 9)
20. Now, the goal is to be in front of a grey box. We were in front of grey_box_1 in step 15 and 18, but after step 19, we are no longer in front of it (effect of pick is to no longer be in front). So after picking, we need to go back in front.

Alternatively, maybe we can just stay in front after step 15 and not pick it up. But the goal requires that there exists a grey box that we are in front of. So step 15 satisfies the goal. However, we also need to satisfy constraint 9 (hold grey_box_1) and constraint 10 (hold an object and be in front of red_box_2).

So let's see:

After step 15: in front of grey_box_1 (goal satisfied), holding red_box_1.

But to satisfy constraint 9, need to hold grey_box_1. So after step 15, need to drop red_box_1, then pick grey_box_1.

But also, constraint 10 requires holding an object and being in front of red_box_2. red_box_2 is in room_2. So after picking grey_box_1, we can go to red_box_2, drop grey_box_1, then pick red_box_2. But that may complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps after dropping red_box_1, we can go to red_box_2, pick it up, which would satisfy constraint 10 (holding it and being in front of it). But let's outline:

After step 15:

16. gotoempty (to drop red_box_1)
17. drop red_box_1 room_2
18. Now, holding nothing.
19. gotoobject red_box_2 room_2
20. pick red_box_2 room_2 (now holding red_box_2, in front of it → satisfies constraint 10)
21. Then, gotoobject grey_box_1 room_2 (to be in front again)
22. Now, the goal is satisfied.

But this adds steps. Alternatively, perhaps after step 15, we can drop red_box_1 somewhere, pick up grey_box_1, then go to red_box_2 while holding it, then be in front of red_box_2. But being in front of red_box_2 while holding grey_box_1 would satisfy constraint 10 (holding some object and in front of red_box_2).

So:

After step 15:

16. gotoempty
17. drop red_box_1 room_2
18. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_2
19. pick grey_box_1 room_2 (now holding it, satisfies constraint 9)
20. gotoobject red_box_2 room_2 (now in front of red_box_2 while holding grey_box_1 → satisfies constraint 10)
21. Then, we can proceed to drop grey_box_1 if needed, but the goal is already satisfied in step 18 or 20? Wait, the goal requires being in front of a grey box. So step 18: after dropping red_box_1, we go back to grey_box_1 and are in front of it. Then, pick it up (step 19), which removes us from being in front. So the goal is only satisfied when we are in front of grey_box_1, which is step 15 and step 18. However, after step 19, we are no longer in front. So the final state needs to have us in front of a grey box. Therefore, after step 19, we need to go back to grey_box_1 again.

So perhaps:

19. pick grey_box_1 room_2
20. gotoempty
21. drop grey_box_1 room_2
22. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_2

Now, step 22 puts us in front of grey_box_1, which satisfies the goal. But this adds more steps. However, the problem requires an optimal plan (shortest possible). So maybe there's a shorter way.

Alternatively, maybe the goal is satisfied as soon as we are in front of grey_box_1, even if we later move away. The problem states that the final goal must be achieved, so the final state must have us in front of a grey box. So the last action must be gotoobject grey_box_1 room_2.

But let's try to outline all steps again, considering all constraints.

Full Plan Outline:

1. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1
2. toggle grey_door_1 (unlock)
3. gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1
4. gotoobject red_box_1 room_1
5. pick red_box_1 room_1
6. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_3
7. gotoroom room_1 room_3 grey_door_1
8. gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4
9. toggle green_door_1 (unlock)
10. gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1
11. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2
12. toggle purple_door_1 (unlock)
13. gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1
14. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_2 (goal satisfied here)
15. gotoempty
16. drop red_box_1 room_2
17. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_2
18. pick grey_box_1 room_2 (constraint 9)
19. gotoobject red_box_2 room_2 (constraint 10: holding grey_box_1 and in front of red_box_2)
20. gotoempty
21. drop grey_box_1 room_2
22. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_2 (final step to satisfy goal)

But this is lengthy. Let's check constraints:

- Constraint 6: in front of red_box_1. Step 4 is gotoobject red_box_1, so that's satisfied.

- Constraint 7: in room_3. Steps 1-3: we were in room_3, then moved to room_1. So need to return to room_3 at some point. Step 7 returns to room_3. So step 7: gotoroom room_1 room_3 grey_door_1 (step 7). So constraint 7 is satisfied here. Then, after step 7, we are in room_3. The constraint requires that in at least one state, we are in room_3. Step 7 and steps 8-9 are in room_3. So yes.

- Constraint 8: if in room_3, then either red_door_1 is unlocked or holding something. When we are in room_3 after step 7, we are holding red_box_1 (from step 5). So that satisfies constraint 8.

- Constraint 9: hold grey_box_1. Step 18.

- Constraint 10: hold an object and in front of red_box_2. Step 19: holding grey_box_1 and in front of red_box_2.

- Constraint 2: green_door_1 is locked in some state. Initially locked. Also, after step 9, it's unlocked. If we lock it again, but that's optional. But since constraint 2 is satisfied by the initial state, no need.

- Constraint 3: when green_door_1 is locked (initially), then must hold red_box_1 at or after. We hold red_box_1 from step 5 onward, which is after the initial state. So satisfied.

- Constraint 4: green_door_1 not locked in some state (step 9).

- Constraint 5: if green_door_1 is not locked (step 9), then must have held red_box_1 earlier. Yes, step 5 is before step 9.

So all constraints are satisfied with this plan.

But is this the shortest possible? Let's see if some steps can be optimized.

For example, after step 9 (unlocking green_door_1), we go back to room_1 (step 10). But maybe from room_3, go directly to room_1 via grey_door_1 (already unlocked), then proceed to room_2 via purple_door_1, unlock it, etc.

Another approach: after step 9 (in room_3), instead of going back to room_1, can we go directly to room_2 via another path? No, because room_3 is connected to room_1 and room_4. To get to room_2, must go through room_1.

Wait, the doors are room_1-room_2 (purple_door_1), room_1-room_3 (grey_door_1), room_2-room_4 (red_door_1), room_3-room_4 (green_door_1). So from room_3, the only way to room_2 is via room_1 and then room_2.

So steps 10-13 are necessary.

Alternative idea: After step 9, go to room_1 (step 10), unlock purple_door_1 (step 11-12), then go to room_2 (step13). Then proceed to grey_box_1.

But maybe we can carry red_box_1 all the way, then drop it in room_2, pick up grey_box_1, then be in front of it.

But the plan needs to be optimal (shortest). Let's count the steps in the current outline:

Steps 1-22. That's 22 actions. Probably too long. Let's see where we can shorten.

Alternative Plan:

1. From room_3, goto grey_door_1 (step1)
2. toggle to unlock (step2)
3. go to room_1 (step3)
4. pick red_box_1 (step4)
5. go back to room_3 (step5)
6. goto green_door_1 (step6)
7. toggle to unlock (step7) → now constraint 4 satisfied
8. go to room_1 again (step8)
9. goto purple_door_1 (step9)
10. toggle to unlock (step10)
11. go to room_2 (step11)
12. goto grey_box_1 (step12) → goal met
13. drop red_box_1 (step13)
14. pick grey_box_1 (step14) → constraint9
15. goto red_box_2 (step15) → constraint10
16. drop grey_box_1 (step16)
17. goto grey_box_1 (step17) → final goal

But let's count the steps:

1. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1
2. toggle grey_door_1
3. gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1
4. gotoobject red_box_1 room_1
5. pick red_box_1 room_1
6. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_3
7. gotoroom room_1 room_3 grey_door_1
8. gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4
9. toggle green_door_1
10. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1
11. gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1
12. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2
13. toggle purple_door_1
14. gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1
15. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_2
16. gotoempty
17. drop red_box_1 room_2
18. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_2
19. pick grey_box_1 room_2
20. gotoobject red_box_2 room_2
21. gotoempty
22. drop grey_box_1 room_2
23. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_2

This is 23 steps, which is longer. Not better.

Alternative Idea: After unlocking green_door_1 (step9), go directly to room_1, then to purple_door_1.

Wait, after step9 (unlock green_door_1), we are in room_3. To go to room_1, we need to use grey_door_1 again.

But perhaps there's a shorter path. Let's try to minimize steps.

Let me think of the essential steps required:

- Unlock grey_door_1 to reach room_1.
- Pick red_box_1 in room_1.
- Unlock green_door_1 in room_3 (requires returning to room_3).
- Unlock purple_door_1 in room_1.
- Go to room_2, get in front of grey_box_1.
- Also, meet all constraints.

But perhaps the optimal plan is:

1. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1
2. toggle grey_door_1
3. gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1
4. gotoobject red_box_1 room_1
5. pick red_box_1 room_1
6. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_3
7. gotoroom room_1 room_3 grey_door_1
8. gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4
9. toggle green_door_1
10. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1
11. gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1
12. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2
13. toggle purple_door_1
14. gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1
15. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_2
16. gotoempty
17. drop red_box_1 room_2
18. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_2
19. pick grey_box_1 room_2
20. gotoobject red_box_2 room_2
21. drop grey_box_1 room_2
22. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_2

This is still 22 steps. Is there a way to reduce this?

Wait, perhaps after step 14 (in room_2), we can directly goto grey_box_1 (step15), then drop red_box_1 (need to gotoempty first), but then pick grey_box_1 and go to red_box_2.

But this seems necessary.

Alternatively, can we avoid dropping red_box_1? For example, after step 15 (in front of grey_box_1), we can drop red_box_1 there, but then we need to be in front of an empty spot to drop. So:

15. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_2
16. drop red_box_1 room_2 (but to drop, we need to be in front of an empty spot. So we can't drop here. So we have to gotoempty first.

Thus:

15. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_2
16. gotoempty room_2
17. drop red_box_1 room_2
18. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_2 (now in front)
19. pick grey_box_1 room_2
20. gotoobject red_box_2 room_2
21. drop grey_box_1 room_2
22. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_2

Still many steps.

But the problem requires an optimal plan. So maybe there's a shorter path.

Wait, perhaps after unlocking purple_door_1, go to room_2, and since we are holding red_box_1, we can drop it in room_2, then pick grey_box_1, then be in front of it.

But dropping requires being in front of an empty spot.

So:

14. gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1 (step14)
15. gotoempty room_2
16. drop red_box_1 room_2
17. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_2
18. pick grey_box_1 room_2 (now holding it)
19. gotoobject red_box_2 room_2 (in front, holding grey_box_1 → satisfies constraint10)
20. gotoempty
21. drop grey_box_1 room_2
22. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_2

But the goal is satisfied at step17 (in front of grey_box_1) and again at step22. However, the final state must be in front of a grey box. So the last action is step22.

But this is still 22 steps. However, perhaps there's a way to combine steps.

Wait, after step14 (in room_2), we can gotoobject grey_box_1 directly. Then, since we're holding red_box_1, we need to drop it. So:

14. gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1
15. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_2
16. gotoempty
17. drop red_box_1 room_2
18. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_2 (now in front, goal met)
19. pick grey_box_1 room_2 (constraint9)
20. gotoobject red_box_2 room_2 (constraint10)
21. drop grey_box_1 room_2 (if needed)
22. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_2 (final)

But this is still 22 steps. Not sure if shorter.

Another Idea: When in room_2, after dropping red_box_1 and picking grey_box_1, can we avoid moving again? For example, after step19 (holding grey_box_1), we can go to red_box_2 while holding it, which satisfies constraint10 (holding an object and in front of red_box_2). Then, the final step is to go back to grey_box_1.

But how many steps does that take?

Alternatively, after step19, gotoobject red_box_2 (step20), then gotoempty and drop, then gotoobject grey_box_1. But that's more steps.

Hmm. It seems challenging to reduce the number of steps further.

But perhaps there's a smarter way. For example, after unlocking purple_door_1, can we proceed to room_2 without going back to room_3 and unlocking green_door_1 first? Let's see.

Wait, the constraints require that we unlock green_door_1 (constraint4) and that when we do so, we have previously held red_box_1 (constraint5). So we need to unlock green_door_1 after picking red_box_1.

So the unlocking of green_door_1 must happen after step5.

So the order is:

1. Unlock grey_door_1
2. Go to room_1, pick red_box_1
3. Return to room_3, unlock green_door_1
4. Then proceed to room_2.

But this adds steps, but it's necessary for constraints.

Alternative Idea: Can we unlock green_door_1 before going to room_1? No, because to unlock green_door_1, we need to be in room_3. But to pick red_box_1, we need to go to room_1. So the order is fixed.

I think the minimal number of steps is around 20. But perhaps the optimal plan is shorter.

Let me try to outline the essential steps without redundant movements:

1. From room_3, go to grey_door_1 and unlock it. (goto, toggle)
2. Go to room_1, pick red_box_1. (gotoroom, goto, pick)
3. Return to room_3, go to green_door_1, unlock it. (gotoroom, goto, toggle)
4. Go back to room_1, go to purple_door_1, unlock it. (gotoroom, goto, toggle)
5. Go to room_2, goto grey_box_1. (gotoroom, goto)
6. Drop red_box_1 (gotoempty, drop)
7. Pick grey_box_1 (goto, pick)
8. Go to red_box_2 (goto)
9. Drop grey_box_1 (gotoempty, drop)
10. Go back to grey_box_1 (goto)

This is 10 steps, but let's count each action:

1. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1
2. toggle grey_door_1
3. gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1
4. gotoobject red_box_1 room_1
5. pick red_box_1 room_1
6. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_3
7. gotoroom room_1 room_3 grey_door_1
8. gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4
9. toggle green_door_1
10. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1
11. gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1
12. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2
13. toggle purple_door_1
14. gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1
15. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_2
16. gotoempty
17. drop red_box_1 room_2
18. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_2
19. pick grey_box_1 room_2
20. gotoobject red_box_2 room_2
21. gotoempty
22. drop grey_box_1 room_2
23. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_2

This is 23 steps, but maybe some steps can be skipped. For example, after step5 (pick red_box_1), can we go directly to purple_door_1 in room_1 instead of returning to room_3 first? Because we need to unlock green_door_1, which requires being in room_3.

Yes, we need to unlock green_door_1 after picking red_box_1. So steps 6-9 are necessary.

So the steps are:

1. goto grey_door_1
2. toggle
3. goto room_1
4. goto red_box_1
5. pick
6. goto grey_door_1 in room_1
7. goto room_3
8. goto green_door_1
9. toggle (unlock)
10. goto grey_door_1
11. goto room_1
12. goto purple_door_1
13. toggle (unlock)
14. goto room_2
15. goto grey_box_1
16. goto empty
17. drop
18. goto grey_box_1
19. pick
20. goto red_box_2
21. goto empty
22. drop
23. goto grey_box_1

But this is still 23 steps. However, some steps can be optimized. For example, after step5 (holding red_box_1), we can go directly to purple_door_1 in room_1, unlock it, then go to room_2. But we need to unlock green_door_1 first.

No, because unlocking green_door_1 requires being in room_3 and in front of it, which requires steps 6-9.

So the steps are mandatory.

But perhaps the key is that after unlocking green_door_1, we don't need to lock it again, which saves steps. Also, some steps can be merged.

Wait, after step9 (unlock green_door_1), we are in room_3, in front of green_door_1. To go back to room_1, we need to go through grey_door_1 again.

So step10: gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1

step11: gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1

step12: gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2

step13: toggle purple_door_1

step14: gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1

step15: gotoobject grey_box_1 room_2

step16: gotoempty

step17: drop red_box_1 room_2

step18: gotoobject grey_box_1 room_2

step19: pick grey_box_1 room_2

step20: gotoobject red_box_2 room_2

step21: drop grey_box_1 room_2

step22: gotoobject grey_box_1 room_2

This is 22 steps. Still a lot.

But perhaps some steps can be omitted. For example, after step19 (picking grey_box_1), being in front of red_box_2 would require going there. But if we are holding grey_box_1 and in front of red_box_2, that satisfies constraint10. So steps19 and 20.

But after picking grey_box_1, we are no longer in front of it. So the final step must be to gotoobject grey_box_1 again.

But this seems unavoidable.

Alternatively, after step18 (in front of grey_box_1), we can just stay there. But the goal requires that the final state is in front of a grey box. So if step18 is the last action, then the goal is satisfied. However, we also need to satisfy constraint9 (hold grey_box_1) and constraint10 (hold an object in front of red_box_2).

So after step18, we are in front of grey_box_1, not holding it. So we need to pick it up (step19), then go to red_box_2 (step20), then drop (step21), then return to grey_box_1 (step22). This adds steps, but is necessary.

Alternatively, after step17 (drop red_box_1), we are in front of empty. Then step18: goto grey_box_1. Then step19: pick. Then step20: goto red_box_2. Now, holding grey_box_1 and in front of red_box_2: satisfies constraint10. Then step21: drop. step22: goto grey_box_1.

This is necessary.

So the steps can't be reduced further. Therefore, the optimal plan is likely this sequence.

Now, let's write the plan in the required format.
