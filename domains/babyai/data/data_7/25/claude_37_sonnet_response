Let's start by understanding the problem:

1. We have a 2D gridworld with 4 rooms (room_1, room_2, room_3, room_4).
2. We have various objects (boxes and balls) and doors, each with a color.
3. We have several actions we can perform: gotoobject, gotoempty, gotodoor, gotoroom, pick, drop, toggle.
4. Our goal is to find a grey box and be in front of it.

Now, let's understand the constraints:

1. We are not allowed to be in room_4 at any point.
2. There must be at least one state where green_door_1 is locked.
3. If green_door_1 is locked, we must be holding red_box_1 at that state or a later state.
4. There must be at least one state where green_door_1 is not locked.
5. If green_door_1 is not locked, we must have been holding red_box_1 before that.
6. We must be in front of red_box_1 at least once.
7. We must be in room_3 at least once.
8. If we are in room_3, red_door_1 should be not locked OR we should be holding some object.
9. We must be holding grey_box_1 at least once.
10. There must be a state where we are holding some object and are in front of red_box_2.

Let's first identify the grey boxes in the initial state:
- grey_box_1 is in room_2
- grey_box_2 is in room_4

Since we can't go to room_4 (constraint 1), we need to be in front of grey_box_1 which is in room_2.

Let's start planning:

Initial state: We are in room_3 and don't have any object.

To reach grey_box_1, we need to go to room_2. To go from room_3 to room_2, we need to go through room_1. But the doors are locked, so we'll need to unlock them.

Let's see what rooms we need to visit:
- room_3 (initial location)
- room_1 (to reach room_2 from room_3)
- room_2 (where grey_box_1 is)

Let's check the door connections:
- room_3 and room_1 are connected via grey_door_1
- room_1 and room_2 are connected via purple_door_1

Both grey_door_1 and purple_door_1 are locked.

Now, let's also ensure we satisfy all the constraints while planning:

Constraints related to green_door_1:
- green_door_1 connects room_3 and room_4. We won't be using it since we can't enter room_4.
- But, green_door_1 must be both locked and unlocked at different times. And if it's unlocked, we must be holding red_box_1 before that.

Constraints related to red_box_1:
- We need to be in front of red_box_1 at least once.
- red_box_1 is in room_1.

Constraints related to room_3:
- If we are in room_3, red_door_1 should be not locked OR we should be holding some object.

Constraints related to grey_box_1:
- We need to hold grey_box_1 at least once.
- grey_box_1 is in room_2.

Constraints related to red_box_2:
- We need to be holding an object and be in front of red_box_2 at least once.
- red_box_2 is in room_2.

There's a lot to consider! Let's start planning step-by-step:

1. We start in room_3.
2. We need to go to room_1, so we need to unlock grey_door_1.
   - Go in front of grey_door_1: `gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1`
   - Toggle the lock: `toggle grey_door_1`
   - Go to room_1: `gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1`
3. In room_1, we need to:
   - Go in front of red_box_1: `gotoobject red_box_1 room_1` (to satisfy the constraint of being in front of red_box_1)
   - Pick red_box_1: `pick red_box_1 room_1` (to satisfy the constraint related to green_door_1)
4. We need to unlock purple_door_1 to go to room_2:
   - Go in front of purple_door_1: `gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2`
   - Toggle the lock: `toggle purple_door_1`
   - Go to room_2: `gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1`
5. In room_2, we need to:
   - Go in front of red_box_2: `gotoobject red_box_2 room_2` (to satisfy the constraint of being in front of red_box_2 while holding an object)
   - Drop red_box_1: `drop red_box_1 room_2`
   - Go in front of grey_box_1: `gotoobject grey_box_1 room_2`
   - Pick grey_box_1: `pick grey_box_1 room_2` (to satisfy the constraint of holding grey_box_1)
6. We need to go back to room_1:
   - Go in front of purple_door_1: `gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1`
   - Go to room_1: `gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1`
7. We need to go back to room_3:
   - Go in front of grey_door_1: `gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_3`
   - Go to room_3: `gotoroom room_1 room_3 grey_door_1`
8. We need to toggle green_door_1:
   - Go in front of green_door_1: `gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4`
   - Toggle the lock: `toggle green_door_1` (This satisfies the constraint of having green_door_1 unlocked after holding red_box_1.)
   - Toggle the lock again: `toggle green_door_1` (This satisfies the constraint of having green_door_1 locked at some point.)
9. We need to drop grey_box_1 in room_3 and go back to room_2:
   - Drop grey_box_1: `drop grey_box_1 room_3`
   - Go in front of grey_door_1: `gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1`
   - Go to room_1: `gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1`
   - Go in front of purple_door_1: `gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2`
   - Go to room_2: `gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1`
10. Finally, we need to be in front of grey_box_1:
    - Go in front of grey_box_1: `gotoobject grey_box_1 room_2`

Let's review this plan against the constraints:

1. "you are not in room_4": We never enter room_4.
2. "green_door_1 is locked": We toggle green_door_1 once to unlock it and then toggle it again to lock it.
3. "If green_door_1 is locked, then you are holding red_box_1 at some point after": We hold red_box_1 after toggling green_door_1 to lock it.
4. "green_door_1 is not locked": We toggle green_door_1 once to unlock it, so it satisfies this constraint.
5. "If green_door_1 is not locked, then you must be holding red_box_1 before that": We pick red_box_1 before toggling green_door_1.
6. "you are in front of red_box_1": We go in front of red_box_1 in room_1.
7. "you are in room_3": We start in room_3 and return to it.
8. "If you are in room_3, then red_door_1 is not locked OR you are holding some object": We'll be holding grey_box_1 when we return to room_3.
9. "you are holding grey_box_1": We pick up grey_box_1 in room_2.
10. "you are holding some object and are in front of red_box_2": We will be holding red_box_1 and go in front of red_box_2.

Alright, the the plan looks good and meets all the constraints. Let's trace it step-by-step to ensure everything flows logically.

Wait, upon re-reading the constraints, constraint 3 says:
"If expression 'green_door_1 is locked' holds in some state s, then expression 'you are holding red_box_1' must hold at s or at some state after s"

And constraint 5 says:
"If expression 'green_door_1 is not locked' holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: 'you are holding red_box_1'"

As per my plan, I'm toggling green_door_1 after picking red_box_1, which means green_door_1 is not locked, and I've held red_box_1 earlier, satisfying constraint 5. But after toggling it again, green_door_1 is locked, and I've already dropped red_box_1, which means I'm not holding red_box_1 at or after the state when green_door_1 is locked. This violates constraint 3.

So, I need to pick up red_box_1 again after re-locking green_door_1.

Let's revise the plan a bit:

1. We start in room_3.
2. We need to go to room_1, so we need to unlock grey_door_1.
   - Go in front of grey_door_1: `gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1`
   - Toggle the lock: `toggle grey_door_1`
   - Go to room_1: `gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1`
3. In room_1, we need to:
   - Go in front of red_box_1: `gotoobject red_box_1 room_1` (to satisfy the constraint of being in front of red_box_1)
   - Pick red_box_1: `pick red_box_1 room_1` (to satisfy the constraint related to green_door_1)
4. We need to unlock purple_door_1 to go to room_2:
   - Go in front of purple_door_1: `gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2`
   - Toggle the lock: `toggle purple_door_1`
   - Go to room_2: `gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1`
5. In room_2, we need to:
   - Go in front of red_box_2: `gotoobject red_box_2 room_2` (to satisfy the constraint of being in front of red_box_2 while holding an object)
   - Drop red_box_1: `drop red_box_1 room_2`
   - Go in front of grey_box_1: `gotoobject grey_box_1 room_2`
   - Pick grey_box_1: `pick grey_box_1 room_2` (to satisfy the constraint of holding grey_box_1)
6. We need to go back to room_1:
   - Go in front of purple_door_1: `gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1`
   - Go to room_1: `gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1`
7. We need to go back to room_3:
   - Go in front of grey_door_1: `gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_3`
   - Go to room_3: `gotoroom room_1 room_3 grey_door_1`
8. We need to toggle green_door_1:
   - Go in front of green_door_1: `gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4`
   - Toggle the lock: `toggle green_door_1` (This satisfies the constraint of having green_door_1 unlocked after holding red_box_1.)
9. We need to drop grey_box_1 in room_3 and go back to room_2 to pick red_box_1 again:
   - Drop grey_box_1: `drop grey_box_1 room_3`
   - Go in front of grey_door_1: `gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1`
   - Go to room_1: `gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1`
   - Go in front of purple_door_1: `gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2`
   - Go to room_2: `gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1`
   - Go in front of red_box_1: `gotoobject red_box_1 room_2`
   - Pick red_box_1: `pick red_box_1 room_2` (This ensures we are holding red_box_1 after green_door_1 is unlocked.)
10. We need to go back to room_3 and toggle green_door_1 again:
    - Go in front of purple_door_1: `gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1`
    - Go to room_1: `gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1`
    - Go in front of grey_door_1: `gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_3`
    - Go to room_3: `gotoroom room_1 room_3 grey_door_1`
    - Go in front of green_door_1: `gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4`
    - Toggle the lock: `toggle green_door_1` (This satisfies the constraint of having green_door_1 locked at some point and ensures we are holding red_box_1 after green_door_1 is locked.)
11. Now, we need to drop red_box_1 and go to room_2 to be in front of grey_box_1:
    - Drop red_box_1: `drop red_box_1 room_3`
    - Go in front of grey_door_1: `gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1`
    - Go to room_1: `gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1`
    - Go in front of purple_door_1: `gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2`
    - Go to room_2: `gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1`
    - Go in front of grey_box_1: `gotoobject grey_box_1 room_2`

Ah, I realized there's a problem with the revised plan. I mentioned that we go in front of red_box_1 in room_2, but red_box_1 is actually in room_1 initially. After we drop red_box_1 in room_2 in step 5, red_box_1 will be in room_2. But then we leave room_2, and later I'm trying to pick up red_box_1 from room_2 again.

So, we need to remember where objects are after we drop them. 

Let's revise the plan again:

1. We start in room_3.
2. We need to go to room_1, so we need to unlock grey_door_1.
   - Go in front of grey_door_1: `gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1`
   - Toggle the lock: `toggle grey_door_1`
   - Go to room_1: `gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1`
3. In room_1, we need to:
   - Go in front of red_box_1: `gotoobject red_box_1 room_1` (to satisfy the constraint of being in front of red_box_1)
   - Pick red_box_1: `pick red_box_1 room_1` (to satisfy the constraint related to green_door_1)
4. We need to unlock purple_door_1 to go to room_2:
   - Go in front of purple_door_1: `gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2`
   - Toggle the lock: `toggle purple_door_1`
   - Go to room_2: `gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1`
5. In room_2, we need to:
   - Go in front of red_box_2: `gotoobject red_box_2 room_2` (to satisfy the constraint of being in front of red_box_2 while holding an object)
   - Go in front of grey_box_1: `gotoobject grey_box_1 room_2`
   - Drop red_box_1: `drop red_box_1 room_2`
   - Pick grey_box_1: `pick grey_box_1 room_2` (to satisfy the constraint of holding grey_box_1)
6. We need to go back to room_1:
   - Go in front of purple_door_1: `gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1`
   - Go to room_1: `gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1`
7. We need to go back to room_3:
   - Go in front of grey_door_1: `gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_3`
   - Go to room_3: `gotoroom room_1 room_3 grey_door_1`
8. We need to toggle green_door_1:
   - Go in front of green_door_1: `gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4`
   - Toggle the lock: `toggle green_door_1` (This satisfies the constraint of having green_door_1 unlocked after holding red_box_1.)
9. We need to drop grey_box_1 in room_3 and go back to room_2 to pick red_box_1 again:
   - Drop grey_box_1: `drop grey_box_1 room_3`
   - Go in front of grey_door_1: `gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1`
   - Go to room_1: `gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1`
   - Go in front of purple_door_1: `gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2`
   - Go to room_2: `gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1`
   - Go in front of red_box_1: `gotoobject red_box_1 room_2`
   - Pick red_box_1: `pick red_box_1 room_2` (This ensures we are holding red_box_1 after green_door_1 is unlocked.)
10. We need to go back to room_3 and toggle green_door_1 again:
    - Go in front of purple_door_1: `gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1`
    - Go to room_1: `gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1`
    - Go in front of grey_door_1: `gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_3`
    - Go to room_3: `gotoroom room_1 room_3 grey_door_1`
    - Go in front of green_door_1: `gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4`
    - Toggle the lock: `toggle green_door_1` (This satisfies the constraint of having green_door_1 locked at some point and ensures we are holding red_box_1 after green_door_1 is locked.)
11. Now, we need to drop red_box_1 and go to room_2 to be in front of grey_box_1:
    - Go in front of grey_door_1: `gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1`
    - Go to room_1: `gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1`
    - Go in front of purple_door_1: `gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2`
    - Go to room_2: `gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1`
    - Drop red_box_1: `drop red_box_1 room_2`
    - Go in front of grey_box_1: `gotoobject grey_box_1 room_2`

But there's a problem again. The goal is to be in front of a grey box, but grey_box_1 is no longer in room_2 because we picked it up. So the goal can't be to be in front of grey_box_1 in room_2 after we've picked it up. 

Let's think about this again. The goal is: "There is a box v such that 'The following conditions are all true: "v is grey", "you are in front of v"'"

So we need to be in front of a grey box. We have two grey boxes: grey_box_1 and grey_box_2.
- grey_box_1 is initially in room_2
- grey_box_2 is initially in room_4

Since we can't go to room_4 (constraint 1), we need to be in front of grey_box_1 in room_2. But we also need to pick it up at some point (constraint 9). After we pick it up, it's no longer in room_2, so we need to drop it back in room_2 or bring grey_box_2 from room_4 to another room.

No, we can't bring grey_box_2 from room_4 because we can't go to room_4.

So, we need to drop grey_box_1 back in room_2 and then be in front of it.

Let's revise the plan one more time:

1. We start in room_3.
2. We need to go to room_1, so we need to unlock grey_door_1.
   - Go in front of grey_door_1: `gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1`
   - Toggle the lock: `toggle grey_door_1`
   - Go to room_1: `gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1`
3. In room_1, we need to:
   - Go in front of red_box_1: `gotoobject red_box_1 room_1` (to satisfy the constraint of being in front of red_box_1)
   - Pick red_box_1: `pick red_box_1 room_1` (to satisfy the constraint related to green_door_1)
4. We need to unlock purple_door_1 to go to room_2:
   - Go in front of purple_door_1: `gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2`
   - Toggle the lock: `toggle purple_door_1`
   - Go to room_2: `gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1`
5. In room_2, we need to:
   - Go in front of red_box_2: `gotoobject red_box_2 room_2` (to satisfy the constraint of being in front of red_box_2 while holding an object)
   - Go in front of grey_box_1: `gotoobject grey_box_1 room_2`
   - Drop red_box_1: `drop red_box_1 room_2`
   - Pick grey_box_1: `pick grey_box_1 room_2` (to satisfy the constraint of holding grey_box_1)
6. We need to go back to room_3:
   - Go in front of purple_door_1: `gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1`
   - Go to room_1: `gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1`
   - Go in front of grey_door_1: `gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_3`
   - Go to room_3: `gotoroom room_1 room_3 grey_door_1`
7. We need to toggle green_door_1:
   - Go in front of green_door_1: `gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4`
   - Toggle the lock: `toggle green_door_1` (This satisfies the constraint of having green_door_1 unlocked after holding red_box_1.)
8. We drop grey_box_1, go back to room_2 to pick red_box_1, and then go back to room_3 to toggle green_door_1 again:
   - Drop grey_box_1: `drop grey_box_1 room_3`
   - Go in front of grey_door_1: `gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1`
   - Go to room_1: `gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1`
   - Go in front of purple_door_1: `gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2`
   - Go to room_2: `gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1`
   - Go in front of red_box_1: `gotoobject red_box_1 room_2`
   - Pick red_box_1: `pick red_box_1 room_2` (This ensures we are holding red_box_1 after green_door_1 is unlocked.)
9. Go back to room_3, toggle green_door_1, and then go back to room_2:
   - Go in front of purple_door_1: `gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1`
   - Go to room_1: `gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1`
   - Go in front of grey_door_1: `gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_3`
   - Go to room_3: `gotoroom room_1 room_3 grey_door_1`
   - Go in front of green_door_1: `gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4`
   - Toggle the lock: `toggle green_door_1` (This satisfies the constraint of having green_door_1 locked at some point and ensures we are holding red_box_1 after green_door_1 is locked.)
10. Go back to room_2, drop red_box_1, pick grey_box_1, and be in front of it:
    - Go in front of grey_door_1: `gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1`
    - Go to room_1: `gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1`
    - Go in front of purple_door_1: `gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2`
    - Go to room_2: `gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1`
    - Go in front of grey_box_1: `gotoobject grey_box_1 room_2`
    - Drop red_box_1: `drop red_box_1 room_2`
    - Pick grey_box_1: `pick grey_box_1 room_2`
    - Drop grey_box_1: `drop grey_box_1 room_2`
    - Go in front of grey_box_1: `gotoobject grey_box_1 room_2`

Wait, step 10 is problematic again. I said "Go in front of grey_box_1: gotoobject grey_box_1 room_2" but I had picked up grey_box_1 earlier, so it's not in room_2 anymore. After I drop grey_box_1 in room_2, it's in front of me, so I don't need to do another "Go in front of grey_box_1" step.

Also, if I've picked up grey_box_1 in step 5, I can't be holding both grey_box_1 and red_box_1 at the same time. I need to drop one to pick up the other. So step 8 and 9 are problematic as well.

Let's re-trace the plan once more:

1. We start in room_3.
2. We need to go to room_1, so we need to unlock grey_door_1.
   - Go in front of grey_door_1: `gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1`
   - Toggle the lock: `toggle grey_door_1`
   - Go to room_1: `gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1`
3. In room_1, we need to:
   - Go in front of red_box_1: `gotoobject red_box_1 room_1` (to satisfy the constraint of being in front of red_box_1)
   - Pick red_box_1: `pick red_box_1 room_1` (to satisfy the constraint related to green_door_1)
4. We need to unlock purple_door_1 to go to room_2:
   - Go in front of purple_door_1: `gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2`
   - Toggle the lock: `toggle purple_door_1`
   - Go to room_2: `gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1`
5. In room_2, we need to:
   - Go in front of red_box_2: `gotoobject red_box_2 room_2` (to satisfy the constraint of being in front of red_box_2 while holding an object)
   - Go to room_3 to unlock green_door_1:
     - Go in front of purple_door_1: `gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1`
     - Go to room_1: `gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1`
     - Go in front of grey_door_1: `gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_3`
     - Go to room_3: `gotoroom room_1 room_3 grey_door_1`
     - Go in front of green_door_1: `gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4`
     - Toggle the lock: `toggle green_door_1` (This satisfies the constraint of having green_door_1 unlocked after holding red_box_1.)
6. Go back to room_2:
   - Go in front of grey_door_1: `gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1`
   - Go to room_1: `gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1`
   - Go in front of purple_door_1: `gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2`
   - Go to room_2: `gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1`
7. In room_2, drop red_box_1 and pick grey_box_1:
   - Go in front of grey_box_1: `gotoobject grey_box_1 room_2`
   - Drop red_box_1: `drop red_box_1 room_2`
   - Pick grey_box_1: `pick grey_box_1 room_2` (to satisfy the constraint of holding grey_box_1)
8. Go back to room_3:
   - Go in front of purple_door_1: `gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1`
   - Go to room_1: `gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1`
   - Go in front of grey_door_1: `gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_3`
   - Go to room_3: `gotoroom room_1 room_3 grey_door_1`
9. Go back to room_2:
   - Go in front of grey_door_1: `gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1`
   - Go to room_1: `gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1`
   - Go in front of purple_door_1: `gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2`
   - Go to room_2: `gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1`
10. In room_2, drop grey_box_1, pick red_box_1, and go back to room_3:
    - Drop grey_box_1: `drop grey_box_1 room_2`
    - Go in front of red_box_1: `gotoobject red_box_1 room_2`
    - Pick red_box_1: `pick red_box_1 room_2` (This ensures we are holding red_box_1 after green_door_1 is unlocked.)
    - Go in front of purple_door_1: `gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1`
    - Go to room_1: `gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1`
    - Go in front of grey_door_1: `gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_3`
    - Go to room_3: `gotoroom room_1 room_3 grey_door_1`
11. In room_3, toggle green_door_1 and go back to room_2:
    - Go in front of green_door_1: `gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4`
    - Toggle the lock: `toggle green_door_1` (This satisfies the constraint of having green_door_1 locked at some point and ensures we are holding red_box_1 after green_door_1 is locked.)
    - Go in front of grey_door_1: `gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1`
    - Go to room_1: `gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1`
    - Go in front of purple_door_1: `gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2`
    - Go to room_2: `gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1`
12. In room_2, drop red_box_1 and go in front of grey_box_1:
    - Drop red_box_1: `drop red_box_1 room_2`
    - Go in front of grey_box_1: `gotoobject grey_box_1 room_2`

Ok, actually this is still not quite right. After we drop grey_box_1 in room_2 in step 10, we say `Go in front of red_box_1: gotoobject red_box_1 room_2`. But we've just dropped grey_box_1, so we are already in front of an object. We need to first go to an empty position or go directly to the position of red_box_1.

Hmm, this is tricky. I need to be careful about the positions of objects and where we're situated.

Let's try a different approach. I'm going to be more explicit about the positions of objects and whether we're in front of an object or not.

1. We start in room_3, not in front of any object.
2. We need to go to room_1, so we need to unlock grey_door_1.
   - Go in front of grey_door_1: `gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1`
   - Toggle the lock: `toggle grey_door_1`
   - Go to room_1: `gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1` (now we're in room_1, not in front of any object)
3. In room_1, we need to:
   - Go in front of red_box_1: `gotoobject red_box_1 room_1` (now we're in front of red_box_1 in room_1)
   - Pick red_box_1: `pick red_box_1 room_1` (now we're holding red_box_1 and not in front of any object)
4. We need to unlock purple_door_1 to go to room_2:
   - Go in front of purple_door_1: `gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2`
   - Toggle the lock: `toggle purple_door_1`
   - Go to room_2: `gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1` (now we're in room_2, not in front of any object)
5. In room_2, we need to:
   - Go in front of red_box_2: `gotoobject red_box_2 room_2` (now we're in front of red_box_2 while holding red_box_1, this satisfies the constraint of being in front of red_box_2 while holding an object)
   - Go to an empty position: `gotoempty` (now we're not in front of any object)
   - Go in front of grey_box_1: `gotoobject grey_box_1 room_2` (now we're in front of grey_box_1 in room_2)
   - Drop red_box_1: `drop red_box_1 room_2` (now we're in front of red_box_1 in room_2 and not holding any object)
   - Go to an empty position: `gotoempty` (now we're not in front of any object)
   - Go in front of grey_box_1: `gotoobject grey_box_1 room_2` (now we're in front of grey_box_1 in room_2)
   - Pick grey_box_1: `pick grey_box_1 room_2` (now we're holding grey_box_1 and not in front of any object)
6. We need to go to room_3 to toggle green_door_1:
   - Go in front of purple_door_1: `gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1`
   - Go to room_1: `gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1` (now we're in room_1, not in front of any object)
   - Go in front of grey_door_1: `gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_3`
   - Go to room_3: `gotoroom room_1 room_3 grey_door_1` (now we're in room_3, not in front of any object)
   - Go in front of green_door_1: `gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4`
   - Toggle the lock: `toggle green_door_1` (This satisfies the constraint of having green_door_1 unlocked after holding red_box_1.)
7. We need to drop grey_box_1, go back to room_2, and pick red_box_1:
   - Go to an empty position: `gotoempty` (now we're not in front of any object)
   - Drop grey_box_1: `drop grey_box_1 room_3` (now we're in front of grey_box_1 in room_3 and not holding any object)
   - Go in front of grey_door_1: `gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1`
   - Go to room_1: `gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1` (now we're in room_1, not in front of any object)
   - Go in front of purple_door_1: `gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2`
   - Go to room_2: `gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1` (now we're in room_2, not in front of any object)
   - Go in front of red_box_1: `gotoobject red_box_1 room_2` (now we're in front of red_box_1 in room_2)
   - Pick red_box_1: `pick red_box_1 room_2` (now we're holding red_box_1 and not in front of any object)
8. We need to go back to room_3 to toggle green_door_1 again:
   - Go in front of purple_door_1: `gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1`
   - Go to room_1: `gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1` (now we're in room_1, not in front of any object)
   - Go in front of grey_door_1: `gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_3`
   - Go to room_3: `gotoroom room_1 room_3 grey_door_1` (now we're in room_3, not in front of any object)
   - Go in front of green_door_1: `gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4`
   - Toggle the lock: `toggle green_door_1` (This satisfies the constraint of having green_door_1 locked at some point and ensures we are holding red_box_1 after green_door_1 is locked.)
9. We need to go back to room_2, and be in front of grey_box_1:
   - Go in front of grey_door_1: `gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1`
   - Go to room_1: `gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1` (now we're in room_1, not in front of any object)
   - Go in front of purple_door_1: `gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2`
   - Go to room_2: `gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1` (now we're in room_2, not in front of any object)
   - Drop red_box_1: `drop red_box_1 room_2` (now we're in front of red_box_1 in room_2 and not holding any object)
   - Go to an empty position: `gotoempty` (now we're not in front of any object)
   - Go in front of grey_box_1: `gotoobject grey_box_1 room_2` (now we're in front of grey_box_1 in room_2, which satisfies the goal)

Ok, this should finally be a more detailed and correct plan. I've traced it step-by-step, keeping track of where objects are and whether we're in front of an object or not. 

However, I just realized a potential issue. After step 5, I've picked up grey_box_1 from room_2, and in step 7, I've dropped it in room_3. But in step 9, I'm trying to go in front of grey_box_1 in room_2. But grey_box_1 is now in room_3, not in room_2!

So, after step 7, grey_box_1 is in room_3, not in room_2. I can't be in front of grey_box_1 in room_2 in step 9.

Let's revise the plan one more time:

1. We start in room_3, not in front of any object.
2. We need to go to room_1, so we need to unlock grey_door_1.
   - Go in front of grey_door_1: `gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1`
   - Toggle the lock: `toggle grey_door_1`
   - Go to room_1: `gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1` (now we're in room_1, not in front of any object)
3. In room_1, we need to:
   - Go in front of red_box_1: `gotoobject red_box_1 room_1` (now we're in front of red_box_1 in room_1)
   - Pick red_box_1: `pick red_box_1 room_1` (now we're holding red_box_1 and not in front of any object)
4. We need to unlock purple_door_1 to go to room_2:
   - Go in front of purple_door_1: `gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2`
   - Toggle the lock: `toggle purple_door_1`
   - Go to room_2: `gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1` (now we're in room_2, not in front of any object)
5. In room_2, we need to:
   - Go in front of red_box_2: `gotoobject red_box_2 room_2` (now we're in front of red_box_2 while holding red_box_1, this satisfies the constraint of being in front of red_box_2 while holding an object)
   - Go to an empty position: `gotoempty` (now we're not in front of any object)
6. We need to go to room_3 to toggle green_door_1:
   - Go in front of purple_door_1: `gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1`
   - Go to room_1: `gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1` (now we're in room_1, not in front of any object)
   - Go in front of grey_door_1: `gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_3`
   - Go to room_3: `gotoroom room_1 room_3 grey_door_1` (now we're in room_3, not in front of any object)
   - Go in front of green_door_1: `gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4`
   - Toggle the lock: `toggle green_door_1` (This satisfies the constraint of having green_door_1 unlocked after holding red_box_1.)
7. We need to toggle green_door_1 again:
   - Toggle the lock: `toggle green_door_1` (This satisfies the constraint of having green_door_1 locked at some point and ensures we are holding red_box_1 after green_door_1 is locked.)
8. We need to drop red_box_1 and bring grey_box_1 from room_2 to room_3:
   - Go to an empty position: `gotoempty` (now we're not in front of any object)
   - Drop red_box_1: `drop red_box_1 room_3` (now we're in front of red_box_1 in room_3 and not holding any object)
   - Go in front of grey_door_1: `gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1`
   - Go to room_1: `gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1` (now we're in room_1, not in front of any object)
   - Go in front of purple_door_1: `gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2`
   - Go to room_2: `gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1` (now we're in room_2, not in front of any object)
   - Go in front of grey_box_1: `gotoobject grey_box_1 room_2` (now we're in front of grey_box_1 in room_2)
   - Pick grey_box_1: `pick grey_box_1 room_2` (now we're holding grey_box_1 and not in front of any object)
9. We need to go back to room_2 and be in front of grey_box_1 (to satisfy the goal):
   - Go in front of purple_door_1: `gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1`
   - Go to room_1: `gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1` (now we're in room_1, not in front of any object)
   - Go in front of grey_door_1: `gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_3`
   - Go to room_3: `gotoroom room_1 room_3 grey_door_1` (now we're in room_3, not in front of any object)
   - Drop grey_box_1: `drop grey_box_1 room_3` (now we're in front of grey_box_1 in room_3, which satisfies the goal)

But again, the goal is to be in front of a grey box. I've dropped grey_box_1 in room_3, so I'm in front of it in room_3. That doesn't satisfy the constraint that I can't be in room_4, but it's not room_4, it's room_3.

Actually, I think the plan is getting overly complicated. Let's go back to the goal: "There is a box v such that 'The following conditions are all true: "v is grey", "you are in front of v"'"

So, I need to be in front of a grey box.

The constraints are:
1. I can't be in room_4.
2. There must be at least one state where green_door_1 is locked.
3. If green_door_1 is locked, I must be holding red_box_1 at that state or a later state.
4. There must be at least one state where green_door_1 is not locked.
5. If green_door_1 is not locked, I must have been holding red_box_1 before that.
6. I must be in front of red_box_1 at least once.
7. I must be in room_3 at least once.
8. If I'm in room_3, red_door_1 should be not locked OR I should be holding some object.
9. I must be holding grey_box_1 at least once.
10. There must be a state where I'm holding some object and are in front of red_box_2.

So, a plan where I'm holding grey_box_1 in room_3 at some point, and then I drop it and remain in front of it, would satisfy the goal. I would never enter room_4, so constraint 1 is satisfied.

It seems like a good idea to check the doors as I go along. I couldn't get to room_4 where grey_box_2 was, but I could go to room_2 where grey_box_1 was. So I need to go to room_2, pick up grey_box_1, and return to a room where I can drop it and be in front of it.

Let's simplify the plan:

1. We start in room_3, not in front of any object.
2. We need to go to room_1, so we need to unlock grey_door_1.
   - Go in front of grey_door_1: `gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1`
   - Toggle the lock: `toggle grey_door_1`
   - Go to room_1: `gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1` (now we're in room_1, not in front of any object)
3. In room_1, we need to:
   - Go in front of red_box_1: `gotoobject red_box_1 room_1` (now we're in front of red_box_1 in room_1, this satisfies constraint 6)
   - Pick red_box_1: `pick red_box_1 room_1` (now we're holding red_box_1 and not in front of any object)
4. We need to unlock purple_door_1 to go to room_2:
   - Go in front of purple_door_1: `gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2`
   - Toggle the lock: `toggle purple_door_1`
   - Go to room_2: `gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1` (now we're in room_2, not in front of any object)
5. In room_2, we need to:
   - Go in front of red_box_2: `gotoobject red_box_2 room_2` (now we're in front of red_box_2 while holding red_box_1, this satisfies constraint 10)
   - Go to an empty position: `gotoempty` (now we're not in front of any object)
6. We need to go to room_3 to toggle green_door_1:
   - Go in front of purple_door_1: `gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1`
   - Go to room_1: `gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1` (now we're in room_1, not in front of any object)
   - Go in front of grey_door_1: `gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_3`
   - Go to room_3: `gotoroom room_1 room_3 grey_door_1` (now we're in room_3, not in front of any object, this satisfies constraint 7. We're holding red_box_1, so constraint 8 is satisfied.)
   - Go in front of green_door_1: `gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4`
   - Toggle the lock: `toggle green_door_1` (This satisfies constraint 4, having green_door_1 unlocked after holding red_box_1.)
7. We need to toggle green_door_1 again:
   - Toggle the lock: `toggle green_door_1` (This satisfies constraint 2, having green_door_1 locked at some point. Constraint 3 is satisfied because we're holding red_box_1 at this point.)
8. We need to drop red_box_1 and go get grey_box_1:
   - Go to an empty position: `gotoempty` (now we're not in front of any object)
   - Drop red_box_1: `drop red_box_1 room_3` (now we're in front of red_box_1 in room_3 and not holding any object)
   - Go in front of grey_door_1: `gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1`
   - Go to room_1: `gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1` (now we're in room_1, not in front of any object)
   - Go in front of purple_door_1: `gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2`
   - Go to room_2: `gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1` (now we're in room_2, not in front of any object)
   - Go in front of grey_box_1: `gotoobject grey_box_1 room_2` (now we're in front of grey_box_1 in room_2)
   - Pick grey_box_1: `pick grey_box_1 room_2` (now we're holding grey_box_1 and not in front of any object, this satisfies constraint 9)

Now, we've satisfied all the constraints except for the main goal, which is to be in front of a grey box. 

We can either:
1. Go back to room_3, drop grey_box_1, and be in front of it OR
2. Stay in room_2, drop grey_box_1, and be in front of it.

Option 2 is more efficient since we're already in room_2:

9. Drop grey_box_1 in room_2:
   - Go to an empty position: `gotoempty` (now we're not in front of any object)
   - Drop grey_box_1: `drop grey_box_1 room_2` (now we're in front of grey_box_1 in room_2, which satisfies the goal)

Let's check if this plan satisfies all the constraints:
1. "you are not in room_4": We never enter room_4.
2. "green_door_1 is locked": We toggle green_door_1 twice, so it's locked in step 7.
3. "If green_door_1 is locked, then you are holding red_box_1 at some point after": We're holding red_box_1 when we toggle green_door_1 to lock it.
4. "green_door_1 is not locked": We toggle green_door_1 once to unlock it in step 6.
5. "If green_door_1 is not locked, then you must be holding red_box_1 before that": We pick red_box_1 in step 3, before toggling green_door_1 to unlock it.
6. "you are in front of red_box_1": We go in front of red_box_1 in step 3.
7. "you are in room_3": We start in room_3 and return to it in step 6.
8. "If you are in room_3, then red_door_1 is not locked OR you are holding some object": We're holding red_box_1 when we return to room_3.
9. "you are holding grey_box_1": We pick up grey_box_1 in step 8.
10. "you are holding some object and are in front of red_box_2": We are holding red_box_1 when we go in front of red_box_2 in step 5.

Yes, this plan satisfies all the constraints.

Ready for the final plan:

1. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1
2. toggle grey_door_1
3. gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1
4. gotoobject red_box_1 room_1
5. pick red_box_1 room_1
6. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2
7. toggle purple_door_1
8. gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1
9. gotoobject red_box_2 room_2
10. gotoempty
11. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1
12. gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1
13. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_3
14. gotoroom room_1 room_3 grey_door_1
15. gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4
16. toggle green_door_1
17. toggle green_door_1
18. gotoempty
19. drop red_box_1 room_3
20. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1
21. gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1
22. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2
23. gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1
24. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_2
25. pick grey_box_1 room_2
26. gotoempty
27. drop grey_box_1 room_2
28. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_2

Wait, step 27 and 28 don't make sense. After dropping grey_box_1, we're already in front of it, so there's no need to do another "Go in front of grey_box_1" step.

So, the last two steps should be:

26. gotoempty
27. drop grey_box_1 room_2

After dropping grey_box_1, we're automatically in front of it, so we are in front of a grey box, which satisfies the goal. (Actually wait, is that how the game works? Let me just double check. The effect of drop says: "After performing this action regarding an object x, (i) you are no longer carrying x, (ii) you are in front of x, (iii) your hands are empty, and (iv) object x is situated in the room you are currently in." So indeed I'm correct, after dropping grey_box_1, we're automatically in front of it.)

So our final plan is:

1. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1
2. toggle grey_door_1
3. gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1
4. gotoobject red_box_1 room_1
5. pick red_box_1 room_1
6. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2
7. toggle purple_door_1
8. gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1
9. gotoobject red_box_2 room_2
10. gotoempty
11. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1
12. gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1
13. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_3
14. gotoroom room_1 room_3 grey_door_1
15. gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4
16. toggle green_door_1
17. toggle green_door_1
18. gotoempty
19. drop red_box_1 room_3
20. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1
21. gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1
22. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2
23. gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1
24. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_2
25. pick grey_box_1 room_2
26. gotoempty
27. drop grey_box_1 room_2

Actually, I've been thinking a lot, and I still think this may not be the most efficient solution. Let me double check that this is the most efficient way to satisfy all the constraints.

Let me re-read the constraints one more time:

1. "you are not in room_4": We never enter room_4.
2. "green_door_1 is locked": We toggle green_door_1 twice, so it's locked in step 17.
3. "If green_door_1 is locked, then you are holding red_box_1 at some point after": We're holding red_box_1 when we toggle green_door_1 to lock it (in steps 17-19), and we drop it immediately after in step 19.
4. "green_door_1 is not locked": We toggle green_door_1 once to unlock it in step 16.
5. "If green_door_1 is not locked, then you must be holding red_box_1 before that": We pick red_box_1 in step 5, before toggling green_door_1 to unlock it.
6. "you are in front of red_box_1": We go in front of red_box_1 in step 4.
7. "you are in room_3": We start in room_3 and return to it in step 14.
8. "If you are in room_3, then red_door_1 is not locked OR you are holding some object": We're holding red_box_1 when we return to room_3 in step 14.
9. "you are holding grey_box_1": We pick up grey_box_1 in step 25.
10. "you are holding some object and are in front of red_box_2": We are holding red_box_1 when we go in front of red_box_2 in step 9.

After thinking all this through - this is optimal and satisfies all constraints.

Wait - I missed something important, which is that I need to be in front of a *box* that is grey, not in front of a *ball*. So grey_box_1 in room_2 is the right target (grey_box_2 is in room_4, which I'm not allowed to enter).

I missed one optimization where we are taking a longer path through room_1 in steps 10-14. Instead of going from room_2 to room_1 to room_3, we could have gone drom room_2 to room_4 to room_3. But we can't go to room_4 because of constraint 1. So, going from room_2 to room_1 to room_3 is the only valid path.

Let's double check that it's most efficient. To satisfy all the constraints, we need to:
1. Get red_box_1 from room_1.
2. Go in front of red_box_2 in room_2 while holding red_box_1.
3. Toggle green_door_1 in room_3 while holding red_box_1.
4. Get grey_box_1 from room_2.
5. Be in front of grey_box_1.

Our plan accomplishes all of these as efficiently as possible, given the constraints. And I believe this most efficient plan is:

1. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1
2. toggle grey_door_1
3. gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1
4. gotoobject red_box_1 room_1
5. pick red_box_1 room_1
6. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2
7. toggle purple_door_1
8. gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1
9. gotoobject red_box_2 room_2
10. gotoempty
11. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1
12. gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1
13. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_3
14. gotoroom room_1 room_3 grey_door_1
15. gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4
16. toggle green_door_1
17. toggle green_door_1
18. gotoempty
19. drop red_box_1 room_3
20. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1
21. gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1
22. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2
23. gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1
24. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_2
25. pick grey_box_1 room_2
26. gotoempty
27. drop grey_box_1 room_2
