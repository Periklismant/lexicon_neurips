Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. Hmm, the goal is to be in front of a red door that's unlocked. The initial state has all doors locked, and I'm in room_4. The constraints are quite a few, so I need to make sure each one is satisfied.

First, let's list the constraints to remember them:

1. At least one state where red_door_1 is locked.
2. If red_door_1 is locked in a state, then either in that state or a later one, grey_door_1 must be unlocked.
3. At least one state where red_door_1 is unlocked.
4. If red_door_1 is unlocked in a state, there must be an earlier state where purple_ball_2 is in room_2.
5. At least one state where I'm in front of red_door_1.
6. If I'm in front of red_door_1, there must be an earlier state where I was in front of blue_door_1.
7. At least one state where yellow_door_1 is unlocked.
8. At least one state where purple_box_1 is in room_4.
9. At least one state where I'm holding red_ball_1 (and holding some object).
10. At least one state where I'm in front of purple_box_1.

The goal is to be in front of a red door (red_door_1) that's unlocked. So, I need to unlock red_door_1 and get in front of it. But according to constraint 4, before unlocking red_door_1, purple_ball_2 must be in room_2. Also, constraint 6 requires that before being in front of red_door_1, I was in front of blue_door_1. Let's see how to approach this.

Starting in room_4. The doors connected to room_4 are red_door_1 (to room_2) and grey_door_1 (to room_3). Both are locked. So, initially, I can't move to room_2 or room_3 unless I unlock those doors. But to unlock a door, I need to be in front of it. But to get in front of a door, I have to be in a room connected by that door. Since I'm in room_4, the doors here are red_door_1 (connecting to room_2) and grey_door_1 (connecting to room_3). Wait, the doors are in pairs. For example, room_4 and room_2 are connected via red_door_1. So, to get in front of red_door_1, I need to be in room_4 or room_2. Since I'm in room_4, I can go to the front of red_door_1 here. Wait, but the "goto door" action requires that I'm in a room connected by the door, which I am. So maybe I can go to red_door_1 from room_4. Let's check.

But the problem is that all doors are locked. So even if I go in front of red_door_1, I can't toggle it unless I'm in front of it. Wait, the toggle action's precondition is that I'm in front of the door. So, I can go to red_door_1 in room_4, toggle it to unlock. But then, after unlocking, I can go to room_2 via red_door_1. But according to constraint 2, if red_door_1 is ever locked (which it is initially), then in that state or later, grey_door_1 must be unlocked. So, perhaps after unlocking red_door_1, I need to unlock grey_door_1 as well? Or maybe when I lock it again? Wait, the constraints say that if red_door_1 is locked in some state s, then grey_door_1 must be not locked in s or a later state. Since red_door_1 starts locked, we have to ensure that grey_door_1 is unlocked at some point after. But grey_door_1 is initially locked, so maybe we need to toggle it to unlock it at some point.

But let's think step by step. The goal is to have red_door_1 unlocked and be in front of it. So, steps needed:

1. Unlock red_door_1.
2. Be in front of red_door_1 while it's unlocked.

But to unlock red_door_1, I need to toggle it. Which requires being in front of it. So:

- From room_4, goto red_door_1 (gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2). But wait, the "gotodoor" action is "gotodoor d r1 r2", but the agent must be in a room connected by d. Since I'm in room_4, which is connected to room_2 via red_door_1, I can go to red_door_1. But is there any object blocking the position in front of the door? The initial state doesn't mention any objects blocking doors. The only objects in room_4 are green_box_1, blue_box_1, red_ball_2. Unless any of these are in front of the door. The problem statement doesn't mention that, so I assume the doors are not blocked. So, I can perform "gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2". Then, "toggle red_door_1" to unlock it. That would satisfy the goal once I'm in front of it. But wait, the goal is to be in front of a red door that's not locked. So after unlocking, I can just be there. But according to constraint 5, I need to be in front of red_door_1 at least once. That's covered here.

But wait, the initial state has red_door_1 locked, so the first time I toggle it, it becomes unlocked. Then, the final state would have it unlocked. But the problem is that there are other constraints to satisfy.

Let's check the constraints:

Constraint 1: At least one state where red_door_1 is locked. Well, initially it's locked. So that's covered.

Constraint 2: If red_door_1 is locked in a state, then in that state or a later one, grey_door_1 is not locked. Since initially, red_door_1 is locked, and grey_door_1 is also locked. So we need to have grey_door_1 unlocked at some point after the initial state. So, we need to unlock grey_door_1. But how? To unlock it, we need to be in front of it. grey_door_1 connects room_4 and room_3. So from room_4, goto grey_door_1, toggle it. But since it's locked, toggling it will unlock it. So maybe after unlocking red_door_1, we can go unlock grey_door_1 as well. But when? Let's think.

But constraint 2 says that whenever red_door_1 is locked (which happens in the initial state), then in that state or later, grey_door_1 is not locked. So, the initial state has red_door_1 locked, but grey_door_1 is also locked. So this violates constraint 2 unless in some later state, grey_door_1 becomes unlocked. So, we need to unlock grey_door_1 at some point after the initial state.

So, after unlocking red_door_1, maybe we need to unlock grey_door_1. But how to reach it? From room_4, we can go to grey_door_1 (gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3), toggle it. Then it becomes unlocked. So that would satisfy the constraint.

Constraint 3: At least one state where red_door_1 is unlocked. That's achieved after toggling it once.

Constraint 4: If red_door_1 is unlocked in some state, there must be an earlier state where purple_ball_2 is in room_2. So, before unlocking red_door_1, purple_ball_2 must be moved to room_2. But purple_ball_2 is initially in room_1. So, how to move it to room_2?

To move it, I need to pick it up and drop it in room_2. But to do that, I need to be in room_1, pick it up, then go to room_2 and drop it. But how to get to room_1 from room_4? The doors are all locked initially.

The doors connecting rooms:

room_1 is connected to room_2 via yellow_door_1 and to room_3 via blue_door_1. room_2 is connected to room_4 via red_door_1. room_3 is connected to room_4 via grey_door_1.

So the path from room_4 to room_1 would be through room_3 (using grey_door_1) to room_3, then via blue_door_1 to room_1. Or via room_2 using red_door_1, then yellow_door_1 to room_1. But all doors are locked. So first, we need to unlock doors to move around.

But since I'm in room_4, the available doors are red_door_1 (to room_2) and grey_door_1 (to room_3). Both are locked. So first, I need to unlock either of these doors to proceed.

But according to the plan, after unlocking red_door_1, I can go to room_2. But to get purple_ball_2 to room_2, which is in room_1, I need to go from room_4 to room_2 via red_door_1 (after unlocking it), then from room_2 to room_1 via yellow_door_1. But yellow_door_1 is locked. So I need to unlock that as well.

Wait, constraint 7 requires that yellow_door_1 is unlocked in at least one state. So we need to toggle yellow_door_1 to unlock it. But to do that, I need to be in front of yellow_door_1. Which is in room_1 or room_2. So if I can reach room_2, then from room_2, go to yellow_door_1 (connecting to room_1), toggle it to unlock. Then, go to room_1 via yellow_door_1.

But how to reach room_2 from room_4? Unlock red_door_1 first.

So the steps could be:

1. From room_4, goto red_door_1 (gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2). Then toggle it to unlock. Now red_door_1 is unlocked. Then, gotoroom room_4 room_2 red_door_1 to move to room_2.

But before that, need to handle the constraint that purple_ball_2 must be in room_2 before unlocking red_door_1. Wait, constraint 4 says that if red_door_1 is unlocked in a state, there must be an earlier state where purple_ball_2 is in room_2. So unlocking red_door_1 must come after moving purple_ball_2 to room_2. But how can I move purple_ball_2 to room_2 if I can't reach room_1 to pick it up?

This seems like a chicken-and-egg problem. Because to get to room_1, I need to unlock doors, but to unlock doors, I need to be in front of them. But maybe there's another path. Let's think:

Alternative approach: Unlock grey_door_1 first. From room_4, goto grey_door_1 (gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3). Then toggle it to unlock. Then, go to room_3 via grey_door_1. From room_3, goto blue_door_1 (connecting to room_1), toggle it to unlock. Then go to room_1 via blue_door_1. Then, in room_1, pick up purple_ball_2, then go back to room_3, then to room_4, then to room_2 via red_door_1 (if unlocked). But then how to unlock red_door_1? Because to unlock it, I need to be in front of it. But if I'm in room_4, I can goto red_door_1 and toggle it. But according to constraint 4, before unlocking red_door_1, purple_ball_2 must be in room_2. So if I'm in room_1, I can take purple_ball_2 to room_2 via yellow_door_1, but yellow_door_1 is locked. So need to unlock it as well.

This is getting complicated. Let's outline the steps required:

- Move purple_ball_2 from room_1 to room_2. This requires:

   a. Access to room_1: So unlock blue_door_1 (connecting room_1 and room_3) or yellow_door_1 (connecting room_1 and room_2).

   b. From room_4, to get to room_1, possible path is room_4 → room_3 via grey_door_1 (unlock it first) → room_1 via blue_door_1 (unlock it) → then to room_1. Then pick up purple_ball_2. Then take it to room_2 via yellow_door_1 (which needs to be unlocked). So need to unlock yellow_door_1 as well.

But this requires unlocking multiple doors. Let's see:

Steps outline:

1. Unlock grey_door_1 from room_4: gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3 → toggle → unlock. Then go to room_3.

2. In room_3, unlock blue_door_1: gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_1 → toggle → unlock. Then go to room_1.

3. In room_1, pick up purple_ball_2.

4. Go to room_2 via yellow_door_1. But yellow_door_1 is locked. So need to unlock it. But to unlock yellow_door_1, need to be in front of it. So from room_1 or room_2. If I'm in room_1, goto yellow_door_1 (connecting to room_2), toggle to unlock. Then go to room_2.

5. Drop purple_ball_2 in room_2. Now constraint 4 is satisfied (purple_ball_2 is in room_2 before unlocking red_door_1).

6. Now, need to unlock red_door_1. To do that, go back to room_4 via room_3 (grey_door_1) or other paths.

Wait, but after dropping purple_ball_2 in room_2, maybe I can go to room_2's red_door_1 (connecting to room_4) and unlock it. But to unlock red_door_1, I can be in room_2 and goto red_door_1 (room_2 to room_4), then toggle it. That would unlock it.

But then, after unlocking red_door_1, the agent can go back to room_4, and then be in front of red_door_1 in room_4 (since the goal is to be in front of a red door that's unlocked). But the goal is to have the final state where I'm in front of such a door.

But let's track all constraints:

Constraint 6: Being in front of red_door_1 requires being in front of blue_door_1 earlier. So, in this path, when would the agent be in front of blue_door_1? When they unlock blue_door_1 (step 2 above). So that satisfies constraint 6.

Constraint 9: At least once holding red_ball_1. red_ball_1 is in room_2. So after getting to room_2, the agent can pick it up. But need to be in room_2 with red_ball_1. So perhaps after moving purple_ball_2 to room_2, the agent can pick up red_ball_1, then drop it (but why?), but constraint 9 just requires holding it once. So perhaps after unlocking yellow_door_1 and entering room_2, pick up red_ball_1, then drop it again. But that's an extra step. Alternatively, pick it up and carry it for a while.

Constraint 8: purple_box_1 must be in room_4. purple_box_1 is initially in room_2. So need to move it to room_4. To do that, the agent needs to pick it up in room_2 and drop it in room_4. But to carry it, the agent must be in room_2, pick up the box, then move to room_4 via red_door_1 (after unlocking it) and drop it there.

Constraint 10: Be in front of purple_box_1. Since it's in room_2 initially, the agent can gotoobject purple_box_1 room_2 when in room_2. That satisfies this constraint.

So putting this all together:

Plan steps:

1. From room_4, go to grey_door_1 (gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3) → toggle to unlock. Now grey_door_1 is unlocked.

2. Gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1 → now in room_3.

3. In room_3, goto blue_door_1 (gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_1) → toggle to unlock. Now blue_door_1 is unlocked.

4. Gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_1 → now in room_1.

5. Gotoobject purple_ball_2 room_1 → pick purple_ball_2.

6. Now, need to go to room_2. To do that, unlock yellow_door_1. But yellow_door_1 is in room_1 and room_2. So from room_1, goto yellow_door_1 (gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2) → toggle to unlock. Now yellow_door_1 is unlocked (satisfies constraint 7).

7. Gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1 → now in room_2.

8. Drop purple_ball_2 in room_2 (drop purple_ball_2 room_2). Now constraint 4 is satisfied (purple_ball_2 is in room_2).

9. Now, need to unlock red_door_1. From room_2, goto red_door_1 (gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_4) → toggle to unlock. Now red_door_1 is unlocked. But wait, we were supposed to have a state where red_door_1 is locked (constraint 1 is covered by initial state) and now it's unlocked (constraint 3). Also, constraint 2: since red_door_1 was locked in the initial state, we need to have grey_door_1 unlocked at some point after. We already unlocked grey_door_1 in step 1, so that's satisfied.

10. Now, in room_2, need to pick up purple_box_1 to move it to room_4 (constraint 8). So gotoobject purple_box_1 room_2 → pick purple_box_1.

11. Gotoroom room_2 room_4 red_door_1 (since it's now unlocked) → now in room_4.

12. Drop purple_box_1 in room_4 → drop purple_box_1 room_4. Now constraint 8 is satisfied.

13. Now, need to handle constraint 9: holding red_ball_1. red_ball_1 is in room_2. So the agent must have picked it up at some point. But after moving to room_4, the agent is in room_4. So perhaps after step 12, go back to room_2 via red_door_1 (unlocked), pick up red_ball_1, then maybe drop it again. Let's see:

14. Gotoroom room_4 room_2 red_door_1 → back to room_2.

15. Gotoobject red_ball_1 room_2 → pick red_ball_1 (now satisfies constraint 9).

16. Drop red_ball_1 room_2 (optional, but since we just need to hold it once, maybe not necessary to drop. But since the agent can't hold multiple objects, maybe just drop it.)

17. Now, to satisfy constraint 5 (be in front of red_door_1), the agent can go to red_door_1 again. But also, the goal is to be in front of an unlocked red door. So from room_4, goto red_door_1 (gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2), then since it's unlocked, that's the final state.

But let's check the steps:

Wait, after step 12, the agent is in room_4 with purple_box_1 there. Then steps 14-16 are in room_2. Then need to get back to room_4 to be in front of red_door_1. So after step 16, the agent is in room_2. Need to go back to room_4 via red_door_1 again.

17. Gotoroom room_2 room_4 red_door_1 → back to room_4.

18. Now, goto red_door_1 (gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2) → now in front of red_door_1, which is unlocked. This satisfies the goal and constraint 5. Also, constraint 6 is satisfied because earlier, in step 3, the agent was in front of blue_door_1 (step 3: gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_1). Wait, no. Step 3 was in room_3, going to blue_door_1. So step 3 is when they were in front of blue_door_1. Then step 18 is being in front of red_door_1. So that satisfies constraint 6 (earlier state with blue_door_1).

Additionally, constraint 10 requires being in front of purple_box_1. That was done in step 10 (gotoobject purple_box_1 room_2). So all constraints are covered.

Now, let's check the sequence of actions:

1. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3

2. toggle grey_door_1

3. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1

4. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_1

5. toggle blue_door_1

6. gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_1

7. gotoobject purple_ball_2 room_1

8. pick purple_ball_2 room_1

9. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2

10. toggle yellow_door_1

11. gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1

12. drop purple_ball_2 room_2

13. gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_4

14. toggle red_door_1

15. gotoobject purple_box_1 room_2

16. pick purple_box_1 room_2

17. gotoroom room_2 room_4 red_door_1

18. drop purple_box_1 room_4

19. gotoroom room_4 room_2 red_door_1

20. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_2

21. pick red_ball_1 room_2

22. drop red_ball_1 room_2 (optional, but maybe not needed. Or maybe just pick and hold for a step.)

23. gotoroom room_2 room_4 red_door_1

24. gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2

But this seems very long. Let's see if we can optimize steps. For example, after step 12 (drop purple_ball_2 in room_2), the next step is to unlock red_door_1. So step 13: gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_4 → toggle red_door_1 (unlocks it). Then pick purple_box_1 and move to room_4. Then, go back to room_2 to get red_ball_1.

Wait, maybe after step 14 (toggle red_door_1), the agent is in front of red_door_1 in room_2. Then they can go to room_4. Then, in room_4, goto red_door_1 again to satisfy being in front of it. Let's see:

After step 14: toggle red_door_1 (now unlocked). Then step 15: gotoroom room_2 room_4 red_door_1 → in room_4. Then, goto purple_box_1 is not necessary because purple_box_1 is in room_2. Wait, no. The agent needs to move purple_box_1 to room_4. So after unlocking red_door_1, the agent is in room_2. They can pick up purple_box_1 in room_2 (step 15: gotoobject purple_box_1 room_2, pick it). Then go to room_4 (step 16: gotoroom room_2 room_4 red_door_1), then drop it (step 17: drop purple_box_1 room_4). Then, to pick red_ball_1, they need to go back to room_2 (step 18: gotoroom room_4 room_2 red_door_1), gotoobject red_ball_1 room_2 (step 19), pick it (step 20). Now holding red_ball_1 satisfies constraint 9. Then, drop it if needed (step 21). Then go back to room_4 (step 22), and goto red_door_1 (step 23: gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2). Now, the agent is in front of red_door_1, which is unlocked. This meets the goal and constraint 5.

So the plan would have these steps. Let's count the actions:

1. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3

2. toggle grey_door_1

3. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1

4. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_1

5. toggle blue_door_1

6. gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_1

7. gotoobject purple_ball_2 room_1

8. pick purple_ball_2 room_1

9. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2

10. toggle yellow_door_1

11. gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1

12. drop purple_ball_2 room_2

13. gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_4

14. toggle red_door_1

15. gotoobject purple_box_1 room_2

16. pick purple_box_1 room_2

17. gotoroom room_2 room_4 red_door_1

18. drop purple_box_1 room_4

19. gotoroom room_4 room_2 red_door_1

20. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_2

21. pick red_ball_1 room_2

22. gotoroom room_2 room_4 red_door_1

23. gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2

This is 23 steps. But maybe there's a shorter way. Let's see:

Wait, after step 14 (toggle red_door_1), can the agent immediately go to room_4 and then goto red_door_1 to satisfy the goal? But need to move purple_box_1 to room_4 (constraint 8). So steps 15-18 are necessary.

Also, constraint 9 requires holding red_ball_1. So steps 19-21 are needed. Unless the agent can pick up red_ball_1 earlier. For example, after step 12 (drop purple_ball_2 in room_2), the agent can pick up red_ball_1 before moving to unlock red_door_1. But then, when they go to unlock red_door_1, they are holding red_ball_1. Is that possible?

Yes. Let's adjust:

After step 12 (drop purple_ball_2), agent is in room_2. Then:

13. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_2

14. pick red_ball_1 room_2 (now constraint 9 is satisfied)

15. drop red_ball_1 room_2 (if needed, but not necessary. The agent can carry it.)

16. gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_4

17. toggle red_door_1 (unlocks it)

18. gotoroom room_2 room_4 red_door_1 (now in room_4, carrying red_ball_1)

19. drop red_ball_1 room_4 (optional, but may not be needed)

Then proceed to move purple_box_1 to room_4.

But this way, constraint 9 is satisfied earlier. Let's try this:

Revised steps after step 12 (drop purple_ball_2):

13. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_2

14. pick red_ball_1 room_2 → satisfies constraint 9

15. drop red_ball_1 room_2 (optional)

16. gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_4

17. toggle red_door_1 → now unlocked

18. gotoroom room_2 room_4 red_door_1 → in room_4

19. gotoobject purple_box_1 room_2 → wait, but agent is in room_4. Can't gotoobject in room_2. So need to go back to room_2.

20. gotoroom room_4 room_2 red_door_1 → back to room_2

21. gotoobject purple_box_1 room_2

22. pick purple_box_1 room_2

23. gotoroom room_2 room_4 red_door_1 → back to room_4

24. drop purple_box_1 room_4 → satisfies constraint 8

25. gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2 → in front of red_door_1 (unlocked), which meets the goal.

This is 25 steps, which is longer. So the first approach might be better.

Alternatively, after step 14 (toggle red_door_1), agent is in front of red_door_1 in room_2. Then they can pick up purple_box_1, go to room_4, drop it, then pick up red_ball_1. Let's see:

After step 14:

15. gotoobject purple_box_1 room_2

16. pick purple_box_1 room_2

17. gotoroom room_2 room_4 red_door_1 → in room_4

18. drop purple_box_1 room_4 → constraint 8 satisfied

19. gotoroom room_4 room_2 red_door_1 → back to room_2

20. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_2

21. pick red_ball_1 room_2 → constraint 9 satisfied

22. drop red_ball_1 room_2 (optional)

23. gotoroom room_2 room_4 red_door_1 → back to room_4

24. gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2 → in front of red_door_1, which is unlocked. Goal achieved.

This is 24 steps, but maybe there's a way to optimize. For example, after dropping purple_box_1 in room_4 (step 18), instead of going back to room_2, the agent can go to red_door_1 from room_4. But they need to be in front of it. So:

After step 18, agent is in room_4. Then:

19. gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2 → now in front of red_door_1 (unlocked). This satisfies the goal. But then constraint 9 (holding red_ball_1) is not addressed. Because the agent hasn't picked up red_ball_1 yet. So need to go back to room_2 to pick it up, but that's after being in front of red_door_1. But constraint 9 requires that at some state, the agent is holding red_ball_1. So maybe after achieving the goal, the agent can proceed to pick it up. But the goal is already achieved. However, the constraints require that all constraints are met in the plan, not necessarily in the final state. So as long as during the plan, the agent holds red_ball_1 once, even after the goal is achieved, it's okay. But that would add steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the agent can pick up red_ball_1 before unlocking red_door_1. Let's see:

After step 12 (drop purple_ball_2 in room_2), agent is in room_2.

13. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_2

14. pick red_ball_1 room_2 → constraint 9 satisfied.

15. drop red_ball_1 room_2

16. gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_4

17. toggle red_door_1 → unlocks it.

18. gotoobject purple_box_1 room_2

19. pick purple_box_1 room_2

20. gotoroom room_2 room_4 red_door_1 → in room_4

21. drop purple_box_1 room_4 → constraint 8 satisfied.

22. gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2 → in front of red_door_1 (unlocked). Goal achieved.

This way, steps 13-15 handle constraint 9. So total steps:

Original steps up to 12: 12 steps.

Steps 13-22: 10 steps. Total 22 steps.

This seems better. Let's outline:

1. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3

2. toggle grey_door_1

3. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1

4. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_1

5. toggle blue_door_1

6. gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_1

7. gotoobject purple_ball_2 room_1

8. pick purple_ball_2 room_1

9. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2

10. toggle yellow_door_1

11. gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1

12. drop purple_ball_2 room_2

13. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_2

14. pick red_ball_1 room_2

15. drop red_ball_1 room_2

16. gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_4

17. toggle red_door_1

18. gotoobject purple_box_1 room_2

19. pick purple_box_1 room_2

20. gotoroom room_2 room_4 red_door_1

21. drop purple_box_1 room_4

22. gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2

This is 22 steps. But step 15 (drop red_ball_1) is optional. If the agent doesn't need to drop it, they can carry it to room_4. But when moving to room_4, the agent must drop it before going through the door? No, the goto room action doesn't require that. The agent can carry objects through doors. So perhaps step 15 can be skipped. So:

After step 14 (pick red_ball_1), the agent is holding it. Then steps 16-20:

16. gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_4

17. toggle red_door_1 → unlocks it.

18. gotoobject purple_box_1 room_2 → wait, agent is in front of red_door_1 in room_2. To gotoobject purple_box_1, they need to be in room_2, which they are, but they are currently in front of red_door_1. So they can perform gotoobject purple_box_1 room_2 to move in front of it.

19. pick purple_box_1 room_2 (but agent is holding red_ball_1; can't pick another object. So this is a problem. So step 14: agent picks red_ball_1, then can't pick purple_box_1 unless they drop red_ball_1 first. Hence, step 15 (drop) is necessary.

So steps must include dropping red_ball_1 before picking up purple_box_1. Hence, the plan must include step 15. So the 22-step plan is correct.

Now, checking all constraints:

1. red_door_1 is locked in initial state → satisfied.

2. When red_door_1 is locked (initial state), grey_door_1 is unlocked in step 2 (toggled). So satisfied.

3. red_door_1 is unlocked in step 17 → satisfied.

4. Before step 17, purple_ball_2 is in room_2 (step 12) → satisfied.

5. In step 22, agent is in front of red_door_1 → satisfied.

6. Before step 22, agent was in front of blue_door_1 in step 4 → satisfied.

7. yellow_door_1 is unlocked in step 10 → satisfied.

8. purple_box_1 is in room_4 after step 21 → satisfied.

9. Holding red_ball_1 in step 14 → satisfied.

10. In step 18, agent is in front of purple_box_1 → satisfied.

All constraints are met. The goal is achieved in step 22: in front of red_door_1 (which is unlocked). So this plan should work.
