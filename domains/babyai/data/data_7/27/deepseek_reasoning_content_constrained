Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. Hmm, the goal is to have a grey box in room_3, be in room_3, and be in front of that box. The initial state has several boxes and a ball in different rooms. All doors are locked initially, which complicates movement. Also, there are a bunch of constraints to satisfy. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the final goal requires being in room_3 with a grey box there. Looking at the initial state, grey_box_3 is already in room_3. So maybe we just need to get to room_3 and be in front of grey_box_3. But wait, the agent starts in room_1. So how do we get to room_3?

The doors connecting room_1 to other rooms are yellow_door_1 (to room_2) and green_door_1 (to room_3). But both are locked. The constraints say that green_door_1 must remain locked in every state. So we can't use green_door_1. Therefore, the only way from room_1 is through yellow_door_1 to room_2. But yellow_door_1 is locked. Wait, the initial state says yellow_door_1 is locked. So the agent needs to unlock it. But to toggle a door, you have to be in front of it. So the agent needs to go to yellow_door_1 in room_1, toggle it to unlock, then go through to room_2.

But wait, the constraints also mention that at some point, the red_door_1 (connecting room_2 and room_4) must be unlocked. Also, when in room_1, the agent must ensure that either they are in front of purple_box_1 (which is in room_4) or grey_box_2 is in room_4. But purple_box_1 is in room_4 initially. So maybe after going to room_2, the agent can go through red_door_1 to room_4, but red_door_1 is locked. So they need to unlock that too. But first, they need to get to red_door_1 in room_2, which might require moving objects blocking it.

Wait, the preconditions for gotodoor are that you are in a room connected by the door and there's no object blocking the position in front of the door. The initial state doesn't mention any objects blocking doors, so maybe doors are unblocked. So maybe the agent can go to the doors directly.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Start in room_1. Need to unlock yellow_door_1 to get to room_2. But to toggle it, need to be in front of it. So:
   - gotoempty (since in room_1, to move in front of empty spot first)
   - gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2 (but wait, the agent is in room_1, which is connected via yellow_door_1. So that's allowed. But is there an object blocking the position? The initial state doesn't mention any, so maybe it's okay.
   - toggle yellow_door_1 (unlocks it)
   - gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1 (now in room_2)

Now in room_2. Need to unlock red_door_1 to get to room_4, perhaps. But the constraint requires that red_door_1 is unlocked at some state. Also, when in room_1, the agent must have either in front of purple_box_1 (which is in room_4) or grey_box_2 in room_4. Since grey_box_2 starts in room_2, maybe we need to move it to room_4. But to do that, the agent needs to pick it up and drop it in room_4. But to get to room_4, red_door_1 must be unlocked. So steps in room_2:

2. In room_2. Need to unlock red_door_1.
   - gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_4
   - toggle red_door_1 (unlocks it)
   - gotoroom room_2 room_4 red_door_1 (now in room_4)

But purple_box_1 is in room_4. So if the agent is in room_1 again later, they need to be in front of purple_box_1 or have grey_box_2 in room_4. But grey_box_2 is in room_2. So maybe the agent needs to bring grey_box_2 to room_4. Let's see.

But wait, after getting to room_4, maybe the agent can go back to room_2, pick up grey_box_2, then take it to room_4. But to carry objects, need to pick them up. So:

Wait, the agent is in room_4. To get back to room_2, use red_door_1 again. But red_door_1 is now unlocked. So:

3. From room_4, gotoempty, then gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2 (but red_door_1 connects room_2 and room_4, so from room_4, it's allowed. Then toggle is not needed since it's already unlocked. Then gotoroom room_4 room_2 red_door_1.

Back in room_2. Now, pick up grey_box_2:

   - gotoobject grey_box_2 room_2
   - pick grey_box_2 room_2 (preconditions: not holding anything, in same room)
   - Now, need to take it to room_4. So go through red_door_1 again.

   - gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_4
   - gotoroom room_2 room_4 red_door_1 (now in room_4)
   - drop grey_box_2 room_4 (since in front of empty spot after moving?)

Wait, after moving to room_4, the agent is in room_4. To drop the box, need to be in front of an empty spot. So:

   - gotoempty in room_4
   - drop grey_box_2 room_4

This satisfies the constraint that when in room_1 (later), there's grey_box_2 in room_4. So now, that constraint is met.

But wait, the agent is in room_4. How to get to room_3? The only door from room_4 is red_door_1 (to room_2) and yellow_door_2 (to room_3). Yellow_door_2 is locked. So need to unlock that. To do that, the agent needs to go to yellow_door_2 in room_4, toggle it. Then go to room_3.

So steps:

4. In room_4. Gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_3
   - toggle yellow_door_2 (unlock it)
   - gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_2 (now in room_3)

Now in room_3, where grey_box_3 is. The goal is to be in room_3 in front of a grey box (grey_box_3). So:

5. In room_3. Gotoobject grey_box_3 room_3
   - Now in front of it. The final goal is achieved.

But wait, the agent needs to have visited room_3, which they just did. Also, the constraints:

- Must have been in room_1 at some point. The agent starts there, so that's covered.

- When in room_1, the condition must hold that either in front of purple_box_1 (in room_4) or grey_box_2 is in room_4. Since we moved grey_box_2 to room_4, that condition holds even if the agent is back in room_1 later. But the agent started in room_1, so unless they return, how does that constraint apply? Wait, the constraint says if the agent is in room_1 in some state s, then in s or a later state, either they are in front of purple_box_1 or grey_box_2 is in room_4. Since we moved grey_box_2 to room_4, even if the agent is in room_1 (initial state), after moving grey_box_2, that condition holds. But the initial state is s0, where the agent is in room_1. At s0, grey_box_2 is not in room_4. So the constraint requires that either in s0 or after, the condition must hold. Since we moved grey_box_2 to room_4 later, that satisfies the constraint.

Another constraint: when in room_3, there must be a prior state where the agent is holding something or red_box_1 is in room_2. red_box_1 starts in room_1. So unless moved, the prior state would require the agent to have held something before entering room_3. In the steps above, the agent held grey_box_2, which counts. So that's covered.

Another constraint: the agent must be in front of green_door_1 at some state. green_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3. Since green_door_1 must stay locked always, but the agent can be in front of it even if it's locked. But to be in front of it, the agent must be in room_1 or room_3. But the agent starts in room_1. So they can go to green_door_1 from room_1. But green_door_1 is locked, but gotodoor only requires that the door connects the current room and another, and that there's no object blocking. So the agent can go to green_door_1 in room_1. But why would they do that? Because the constraint requires being in front of green_door_1 at least once, and another constraint says that if you are in front of green_door_1, you must have held yellow_box_2 earlier. yellow_box_2 is in room_3. So the agent needs to get yellow_box_2, hold it, then go to green_door_1.

Wait, this complicates things. So steps to satisfy the constraint about being in front of green_door_1 and having held yellow_box_2 before.

Let's see. The agent needs to:

At some point, be in front of green_door_1. To do that, they need to be in room_1 or room_3. Since green_door_1 connects them. The agent starts in room_1, so maybe they can go to green_door_1 from there. But the constraint says that when they are in front of green_door_1, there must have been a prior state where they held yellow_box_2.

yellow_box_2 is in room_3. So the agent needs to get to room_3, pick up yellow_box_2, then go to green_door_1. But getting to room_3 requires unlocking green_door_1, but that's not allowed because the constraint says green_door_1 must be locked in every state. So the agent can't go through green_door_1. So how to get to room_3? The other way is through room_4. From room_1 to room_2 via yellow_door_1, then to room_4 via red_door_1, then to room_3 via yellow_door_2. But yellow_door_2 is initially locked. So the agent can unlock it once in room_4.

Wait, in the steps I outlined earlier, the agent went to room_4, unlocked yellow_door_2, then went to room_3. So that's possible. Once in room_3, the agent can pick up yellow_box_2 (since it's in room_3), then perhaps go back through yellow_door_2 to room_4, then to room_2, then to room_1, then go to green_door_1 in room_1. But that's a long path. Let's see.

After step 5, the agent is in room_3 in front of grey_box_3. But they need to satisfy the constraint about being in front of green_door_1. So after achieving the goal, perhaps they can do that. But the plan must end when the goal is achieved. Wait, no. The goal is to have a grey box in room_3, be in room_3, and in front of it. Once that's achieved, the plan can end. But the constraints must be satisfied during the plan. So perhaps before achieving the goal, the agent must have already been in front of green_door_1 and met the other constraints.

Let me adjust the plan. Let's say after getting to room_3 via room_4, the agent picks up yellow_box_2, then returns to room_1 to go to green_door_1. But that's complicated. Let's outline:

After step 4 (in room_3), the agent can:

6. In room_3. Gotoobject yellow_box_2 room_3
7. pick yellow_box_2 room_3
8. Now holding yellow_box_2. Then need to go back to room_1 to be in front of green_door_1.

But how to get back? From room_3, doors are green_door_1 (locked) and yellow_door_2 (now unlocked). So go through yellow_door_2 to room_4, then red_door_1 to room_2, then yellow_door_1 to room_1.

So:

8. From room_3, gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_3 room_4
9. gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_2 (now in room_4)
10. gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2
11. gotoroom room_4 room_2 red_door_1 (now in room_2)
12. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_1
13. gotoroom room_2 room_1 yellow_door_1 (back in room_1)
14. gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3 (now in front of green_door_1)
15. Then, drop yellow_box_2 in room_1? But maybe not necessary. The constraint is that when in front of green_door_1, the agent must have held yellow_box_2 before. Since they are holding it now, they can drop it later.

But the agent needs to be in front of green_door_1. So step 14 is 'gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3' which puts them in front of green_door_1. That satisfies the constraint because they previously picked up yellow_box_2 (step 7).

But then, after that, the agent needs to get back to room_3 to achieve the goal. So:

15. toggle green_door_1 is not allowed because it must remain locked. So can't go through it. So need to go back through room_2, room_4, room_3 again.

16. From room_1, gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2
17. gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1 (room_2)
18. gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_4 (already unlocked)
19. gotoroom room_2 room_4 red_door_1 (room_4)
20. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_3
21. gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_2 (room_3 again)
22. gotoobject grey_box_3 room_3 (achieve the goal)

But this makes the plan very long. Also, the agent is still holding yellow_box_2 until step 22? Wait, no. After step 7, the agent picks up yellow_box_2. Then they go through rooms to room_1, step 14 is in front of green_door_1. Then they need to drop the box somewhere. Otherwise, they can't pick up anything else. But the final goal doesn't require holding anything, just being in front of the grey box. So maybe after being in front of green_door_1, the agent can drop yellow_box_2 in room_1. But that's extra steps.

Alternatively, after step 14 (in front of green_door_1), they can drop yellow_box_2 in room_1. Then proceed.

But this is making the plan longer. Also, there's another constraint: at least one state must have "empty is in room_1" or "in front of yellow_box_2". If we drop yellow_box_2 in room_1, then "empty is in room_1" would be false, but "you are in front of yellow_box_2" when you drop it. Because when you drop, you are in front of it. So that would satisfy that constraint.

Alternatively, when the agent is in room_3 initially (after step 5), they can go to yellow_box_2, pick it up, then go to room_1 via the long path, drop it there, and then proceed.

But this is getting complicated. Let me try to outline a plan that includes all these steps.

Alternative approach:

1. Start in room_1. Unlock yellow_door_1.
   - gotoempty (to move)
   - gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2
   - toggle yellow_door_1 (unlock)
   - gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1 (now in room_2)

2. In room_2. Unlock red_door_1.
   - gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_4
   - toggle red_door_1 (unlock)
   - gotoroom room_2 room_4 red_door_1 (now in room_4)

3. In room_4. Unlock yellow_door_2.
   - gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_3
   - toggle yellow_door_2 (unlock)
   - gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_2 (now in room_3)

4. In room_3. Pick up yellow_box_2.
   - gotoobject yellow_box_2 room_3
   - pick yellow_box_2 room_3

5. Return to room_1 to go to green_door_1.
   - From room_3, go back to room_4 via yellow_door_2.
   - gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_3 room_4
   - gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_2
   - From room_4, go to room_2 via red_door_1.
   - gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2
   - gotoroom room_4 room_2 red_door_1
   - From room_2, go to room_1 via yellow_door_1.
   - gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_1
   - gotoroom room_2 room_1 yellow_door_1 (now in room_1)

6. In room_1. Go to green_door_1.
   - gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3 (now in front of green_door_1, which satisfies the constraint. Also, since the agent is holding yellow_box_2, which was picked up earlier, this meets the precondition for the constraint that when in front of green_door_1, they had held yellow_box_2 before.)

7. Drop yellow_box_2 in room_1.
   - gotoempty in room_1 (since after entering room_1, they are not in front of any object)
   - drop yellow_box_2 room_1 (now, in front of it. This satisfies the constraint that in at least one state, either empty is in room_1 (which is not the case here) or in front of yellow_box_2 (which is true here). So that's covered.)

8. Now, need to return to room_3 to achieve the goal. Since the agent is in room_1, they can go back through the same path.

   - gotoempty (in room_1)
   - gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2
   - gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1 (room_2)
   - gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_4
   - gotoroom room_2 room_4 red_door_1 (room_4)
   - gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_3
   - gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_2 (room_3)

9. In room_3. Now, need to be in front of grey_box_3.
   - gotoobject grey_box_3 room_3
   - Since the agent is not holding anything, they can be in front of it.

But wait, the goal requires that the agent is in room_3, there's a grey box (grey_box_3) in room_3, and they are in front of it. All these are now true.

But the constraint that when in room_3, there must be a prior state where the agent was holding something or red_box_1 is in room_2. The agent was holding yellow_box_2 earlier (steps 4-7), so that's satisfied.

The constraint that red_door_1 is unlocked at some state: done in step 2.

The constraint that you are in room_3 at least once: done in steps 3, 4, 8, 9.

The constraint that when in room_1, either in front of purple_box_1 or grey_box_2 in room_4. After step 7, grey_box_2 is still in room_2. Wait, no. Earlier steps didn't move grey_box_2. Oh no! I forgot that part. Because in the initial plan I thought of moving grey_box_2 to room_4, but in the steps I outlined above, we picked up yellow_box_2 instead. So that's a problem.

Because when the agent is in room_1 (steps 5-7), the condition requires that either they are in front of purple_box_1 (which is in room_4) or grey_box_2 is in room_4. Since grey_box_2 is in room_2 initially, and we didn't move it, this condition isn't met. So the constraint is violated.

So that's a mistake. Therefore, the agent needs to move grey_box_2 to room_4 to satisfy the constraint that whenever they are in room_1, either they are in front of purple_box_1 or grey_box_2 is in room_4. Since the agent starts in room_1 (state s0), which is before moving grey_box_2, the condition must be met in s0 or later. But in s0, grey_box_2 is in room_2, so the agent must later move it to room_4.

So steps must include moving grey_box_2 to room_4.

Let me revise the plan:

1. Start in room_1. Unlock yellow_door_1.
   - gotoempty
   - gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2
   - toggle yellow_door_1 (unlock)
   - gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1 (now in room_2)

2. In room_2. Unlock red_door_1.
   - gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_4
   - toggle red_door_1 (unlock)
   - Now, pick up grey_box_2 to move to room_4.
   - gotoobject grey_box_2 room_2
   - pick grey_box_2 room_2
   - gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_4
   - gotoroom room_2 room_4 red_door_1 (now in room_4)
   - gotoempty room_4
   - drop grey_box_2 room_4 (now grey_box_2 is in room_4, satisfying the constraint when in room_1)

3. Now, in room_4. Unlock yellow_door_2.
   - gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_3
   - toggle yellow_door_2 (unlock)
   - gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_2 (now in room_3)

4. In room_3. Pick up yellow_box_2.
   - gotoobject yellow_box_2 room_3
   - pick yellow_box_2 room_3

5. Return to room_1 via room_4 and room_2.
   - gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_3 room_4
   - gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_2 (room_4)
   - gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2
   - gotoroom room_4 room_2 red_door_1 (room_2)
   - gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_1
   - gotoroom room_2 room_1 yellow_door_1 (room_1)

6. In room_1. Go to green_door_1.
   - gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3
   - Now in front of green_door_1, which satisfies that constraint. Also, the agent is holding yellow_box_2, meeting the precondition for that constraint.

7. Drop yellow_box_2 in room_1.
   - gotoempty room_1 (to drop)
   - drop yellow_box_2 room_1 (now in front of it, satisfying the constraint about empty or in front of yellow_box_2)

8. Now, return to room_3 to achieve the goal.
   - gotoempty room_1
   - gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2
   - gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1 (room_2)
   - gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_4
   - gotoroom room_2 room_4 red_door_1 (room_4)
   - gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_3
   - gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_2 (room_3)

9. In room_3. Go to grey_box_3.
   - gotoobject grey_box_3 room_3
   - Now, the agent is in room_3, in front of grey_box_3, which is grey and in room_3. Goal achieved.

Now, let's check all constraints:

- Must hold something or grey_box_3 in room_1 at least once. The agent picked grey_box_2 and moved it to room_4, so that's holding something. So satisfied.

- green_door_1 remains locked always. The agent never toggled it, so yes.

- Must be in room_1 at least once. Started there, and returned later.

- When in room_1 (steps 1,5,6,7), after step 2, grey_box_2 is in room_4. So whenever in room_1 after moving grey_box_2, the condition holds. For the initial state (s0), since grey_box_2 isn't in room_4 yet, but after step 2, when the agent is in room_1 again (step 5), grey_box_2 is in room_4. So the condition holds from step 5 onwards.

- red_door_1 is unlocked in step 2. Satisfied.

- Must be in room_3 at least once. Steps 3,4,8,9.

- When in room_3 (steps 3,4,8,9), the prior state where holding something (yellow_box_2) exists (steps 4,5,6,7).

- Must be in front of green_door_1. Done in step 6.

- When in front of green_door_1 (step 6), prior state of holding yellow_box_2 (steps 4-5).

- At least one state where empty in room_1 or in front of yellow_box_2. Step 7 drops yellow_box_2 in room_1, so in front of it. Satisfied.

All constraints are met. Now, the plan:

But wait, let's list the steps properly:

1. gotoempty room_1
2. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2
3. toggle yellow_door_1
4. gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1
5. gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_4
6. toggle red_door_1
7. gotoobject grey_box_2 room_2
8. pick grey_box_2 room_2
9. gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_4
10. gotoroom room_2 room_4 red_door_1
11. gotoempty room_4
12. drop grey_box_2 room_4
13. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_3
14. toggle yellow_door_2
15. gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_2
16. gotoobject yellow_box_2 room_3
17. pick yellow_box_2 room_3
18. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_3 room_4
19. gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_2
20. gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2
21. gotoroom room_4 room_2 red_door_1
22. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_1
23. gotoroom room_2 room_1 yellow_door_1
24. gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3
25. gotoempty room_1
26. drop yellow_box_2 room_1
27. gotoempty room_1
28. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2
29. gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1
30. gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_4
31. gotoroom room_2 room_4 red_door_1
32. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_3
33. gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_2
34. gotoobject grey_box_3 room_3

But this is a very long plan. However, the problem states that an optimal plan (shortest possible) is needed. So maybe there's a shorter way.

Alternative approach: After moving grey_box_2 to room_4, instead of going all the way back to room_1 to satisfy the green_door_1 front constraint, can the agent somehow do that after achieving the goal?

But the goal requires being in room_3 in front of grey_box_3. So after achieving the goal, the agent is done. But the constraints must be met during the plan. For example, being in front of green_door_1 must happen before the end.

Alternatively, after achieving the goal, the agent can then go back to room_1 and do the necessary steps. But the plan must end when the goal is achieved. So the agent must do all required steps before achieving the goal.

Hmm. Let's see if there's a shorter path.

Alternative steps:

1. Unlock yellow_door_1, go to room_2.

2. Unlock red_door_1, go to room_4.

3. Move grey_box_2 to room_4.

4. Unlock yellow_door_2, go to room_3.

5. Pick up yellow_box_2.

6. Go back to room_1 via room_4 and room_2.

7. Go to green_door_1, drop yellow_box_2.

8. Go back to room_3 via the same path.

9. Go to grey_box_3.

That's the same as before.

But perhaps there's a smarter way. Let's think: Can the agent pick up yellow_box_2 before moving grey_box_2? Probably not, since grey_box_2 is in room_2 and yellow_box_2 is in room_3. The agent needs to unlock doors to get there.

Wait, after moving grey_box_2 to room_4, the agent can go to room_3, pick up yellow_box_2, then return to room_1. But the path is still long.

Alternatively, after moving grey_box_2 to room_4, the agent can go to room_3, pick up yellow_box_2, then go to room_4, then room_2, then room_1, then to green_door_1, drop the box, then return to room_3. But this adds steps.

Another way: After dropping grey_box_2 in room_4 (step 12), the agent can go to room_3, pick up yellow_box_2, then return to room_4, room_2, room_1, then go to green_door_1, drop the box, then go back to room_3.

But this seems necessary. So the plan must be as long as needed.

But perhaps some steps can be optimized. For example, after step 12 (drop grey_box_2 in room_4), the agent can directly proceed to unlock yellow_door_2 and go to room_3.

Yes. So steps 13-15 are:

13. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_3
14. toggle yellow_door_2
15. gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_2 (room_3)

Then pick up yellow_box_2 (steps 16-17), then return to room_1.

But how to get back? From room_3 to room_4 (step 18-19), then room_4 to room_2 (steps 20-21), then room_2 to room_1 (steps 22-23), then go to green_door_1 (step24), drop yellow_box_2 (step25-26), then go back to room_3 (steps27-33), then goto grey_box_3.

But this is indeed the same as before. It's unavoidable.

Is there a way to avoid carrying yellow_box_2 all the way to room_1? For example, can the agent drop it in room_4, then pick it up again later? But that would add more steps.

Alternatively, after picking up yellow_box_2 in room_3, the agent could drop it somewhere along the way, but the constraint requires being in front of green_door_1, which is in room_1. So the agent must take it to room_1.

Thus, the plan I outlined earlier seems necessary, though it's long. But the problem asks for an optimal plan, which is the shortest possible. Is there a shorter path?

Wait, let's see. When the agent is in room_3 after step 15, they can go to green_door_1 via room_1. But green_door_1 is locked. So they can't go through it. But can they goto the door from room_1?

Yes. So the agent needs to be in room_1 to be in front of green_door_1. Thus, the steps to return to room_1 are necessary.

Another idea: Can the agent, after moving grey_box_2 to room_4 and unlocking yellow_door_2, go to room_3, pick up yellow_box_2, then go back to room_4, then room_2, room_1, and in room_1, go to green_door_1. That's the same as before.

Alternatively, can the agent, after dropping grey_box_2 in room_4, pick up purple_box_1 and carry it to room_1? But purple_box_1 is in room_4. Then, when in room_1, being in front of purple_box_1 would satisfy the constraint. But purple_box_1 is in room_4. Unless the agent moves it to room_1.

But moving purple_box_1 would require picking it up in room_4. Then, when in room_1, dropping it there. Then, the agent could be in front of purple_box_1 in room_1, satisfying the constraint. This might save steps compared to moving yellow_box_2.

Let's explore this:

Revised plan:

1. Unlock yellow_door_1, go to room_2.

2. Unlock red_door_1, go to room_4.

3. Pick up purple_box_1 in room_4.

4. Return to room_1, drop purple_box_1 there. Now, when in room_1, being in front of purple_box_1 satisfies the constraint.

5. Then proceed to unlock yellow_door_2, go to room_3, and achieve the goal.

This way, the agent doesn't need to handle yellow_box_2 and the green_door_1 constraint is satisfied by having purple_box_1 in room_1. But does this work?

Let's outline:

1. gotoempty (room_1)
2. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2
3. toggle yellow_door_1
4. gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1
5. gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_4
6. toggle red_door_1
7. gotoroom room_2 room_4 red_door_1 (now in room_4)
8. gotoobject purple_box_1 room_4
9. pick purple_box_1 room_4
10. gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2
11. gotoroom room_4 room_2 red_door_1 (room_2)
12. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_1
13. gotoroom room_2 room_1 yellow_door_1 (room_1)
14. gotoempty room_1
15. drop purple_box_1 room_1 (now in front of it, so when in room_1, you can be in front of purple_box_1, satisfying the constraint)
16. Then proceed to unlock yellow_door_2 and go to room_3.

But how to unlock yellow_door_2? From room_1, you need to go through room_2, room_4, then to room_3.

So:

16. gotoempty room_1
17. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2
18. gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1 (room_2)
19. gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_4
20. gotoroom room_2 room_4 red_door_1 (room_4)
21. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_3
22. toggle yellow_door_2
23. gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_2 (room_3)
24. gotoobject grey_box_3 room_3

Now, check constraints:

- The constraint about being in front of green_door_1: not addressed. The agent needs to be in front of green_door_1 at least once. So this approach doesn't satisfy that. Therefore, this path is invalid.

Thus, the initial approach where the agent handles yellow_box_2 is necessary to meet the constraint about being in front of green_door_1.

Back to the original plan.

But maybe there's a way to avoid carrying yellow_box_2 all the way to room_1. For example, after picking it up in room_3, drop it in room_4, then when in room_1, pick it up again. But that adds steps.

Alternatively, after unlocking yellow_door_2, the agent can go to room_3, pick up yellow_box_2, then return to room_4, drop it there, then go to room_1 via room_2. Then, in room_1, pick up yellow_box_2 from room_4 (which requires going back to room_4 again). Not efficient.

Hmm. It seems that the original plan is the only way to satisfy all constraints, even though it's lengthy. Therefore, the plan provided must include all those steps.

But wait, maybe there's a shorter path. Let me think again.

What if the agent, after moving grey_box_2 to room_4 (step 12), instead of going to room_3, first goes to room_1 to satisfy the green_door_1 constraint. Let's see:

After step 12 (grey_box_2 in room_4, agent in room_4):

13. From room_4, go to room_2 via red_door_1.

14. From room_2, go to room_1 via yellow_door_1.

15. In room_1, go to green_door_1.

But the agent needs to have held yellow_box_2 before being in front of green_door_1. But yellow_box_2 is in room_3. So this doesn't work. The agent hasn't picked up yellow_box_2 yet.

Thus, the agent must first get yellow_box_2 from room_3, then return to room_1.

Thus, the original plan is necessary.

Therefore, the optimal plan is the sequence of actions I outlined earlier, even though it's long. However, perhaps there's a shorter way if some steps can be reordered.

Wait, after step 12 (dropping grey_box_2 in room_4), the agent is in room_4. Instead of immediately going to room_3, could they go to room_1 first to handle the green_door_1 constraint?

But to satisfy the constraint when in front of green_door_1, the agent must have held yellow_box_2 before. So they need to pick up yellow_box_2 first.

Thus, the order must be:

- Move grey_box_2 to room_4.

- Unlock yellow_door_2 and go to room_3.

- Pick up yellow_box_2.

- Return to room_1 to be in front of green_door_1.

Thus, the original plan is the correct path.

So the final plan is as follows:

```
```
gotoempty
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2
toggle yellow_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1
gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_4
toggle red_door_1
gotoobject grey_box_2 room_2
pick grey_box_2 room_2
gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_4
gotoroom room_2 room_4 red_door_1
gotoempty
drop grey_box_2 room_4
gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_3
toggle yellow_door_2
gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_2
gotoobject yellow_box_2 room_3
pick yellow_box_2 room_3
gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_3 room_4
gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_2
gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2
gotoroom room_4 room_2 red_door_1
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_1
gotoroom room_2 room_1 yellow_door_1
gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3
gotoempty
drop yellow_box_2 room_1
gotoempty
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2
gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1
gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_4
gotoroom room_2 room_4 red_door_1
gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_3
gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_2
gotoobject grey_box_3 room_3
```
```

But I need to make sure each action is correctly formatted and the steps are correct.

For example, after step 'drop grey_box_2 room_4', the agent is in room_4 and in front of grey_box_2. Then, to go to yellow_door_2, they need to gotoempty first or goto the door. Since the drop action leaves them in front of the object, they can't immediately go to the door unless they move away. So after dropping, they need to gotoempty or another object.

Wait, the drop action's effect is that the agent is in front of the object they dropped. So after dropping grey_box_2 in room_4, the agent is in front of it. Therefore, to go to yellow_door_2, they need to gotoempty first to move away.

So after step 'drop grey_box_2 room_4', add:

gotoempty room_4

Then gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_3

So the plan needs to include that step.

Similarly, after dropping yellow_box_2 in room_1, the agent is in front of it. To leave, they need to gotoempty or another object.

This adds more steps. So the initial plan might have missed these steps, leading to invalid preconditions.

Let me correct the plan with these steps:

Revised plan:

1. gotoempty (room_1)
2. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2
3. toggle yellow_door_1
4. gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1
5. gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_4
6. toggle red_door_1
7. gotoobject grey_box_2 room_2
8. pick grey_box_2 room_2
9. gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_4
10. gotoroom room_2 room_4 red_door_1
11. gotoempty room_4
12. drop grey_box_2 room_4
13. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_3
14. toggle yellow_door_2
15. gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_2
16. gotoobject yellow_box_2 room_3
17. pick yellow_box_2 room_3
18. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_3 room_4
19. gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_2
20. gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2
21. gotoroom room_4 room_2 red_door_1
22. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_1
23. gotoroom room_2 room_1 yellow_door_1
24. gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3
25. gotoempty room_1
26. drop yellow_box_2 room_1
27. gotoempty room_1
28. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2
29. gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1
30. gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_4
31. gotoroom room_2 room_4 red_door_1
32. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_3
33. gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_2
34. gotoobject grey_box_3 room_3

Now, checking each action's preconditions:

- After dropping grey_box_2 (step 12), agent is in front of it. To go to yellow_door_2, they must gotoempty first (step 13).

Similarly, after dropping yellow_box_2 (step 26), agent is in front of it. To leave, gotoempty (step 27) is needed.

This adds steps but ensures preconditions are met.

This plan now has 34 steps, which seems long, but it's necessary to meet all constraints and preconditions. However, perhaps there's a more optimal path.

Alternative idea: After step 12 (drop grey_box_2 in room_4), the agent is in front of it. Instead of gotoempty, they can directly go to yellow_door_2. But the gotodoor action requires that there's no object blocking the door's position. Since grey_box_2 is in front of the agent, but not blocking the door, perhaps it's allowed. Wait, the precondition for gotodoor is that there's no object blocking the position in front of the door in the current room. The agent's current position is in front of grey_box_2, not blocking the door. So maybe they can go directly to the door without gotoempty. Let me check the preconditions.

The "goto door" action's precondition: (i) you are in a room connected by the door, (ii) no object blocking the position in front of the door.

If the agent is in room_4 and wants to go to yellow_door_2, which connects room_4 and room_3. The position in front of the door in room_4 must not be blocked. Since grey_box_2 is in room_4, but not necessarily blocking the door's position. Assuming that the doors' positions are separate from objects' positions, then it's allowed. So maybe the agent can go from in front of grey_box_2 directly to the door. Thus, steps 13-14 can be:

13. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_3
14. toggle yellow_door_2
15. gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_2

This would save the gotoempty step (step 11 in the previous plan).

But is this possible? The agent is in front of grey_box_2. To go to the door, they need to move from their current position. The gotodoor action moves them to the door's position. The effect is that they are no longer in front of the previous object (grey_box_2) and now in front of the door. So perhaps they can directly perform gotodoor without needing to gotoempty first. This would reduce steps.

Similarly, after dropping yellow_box_2 in room_1 (step 26), the agent is in front of it. To leave, they can goto the door directly without gotoempty.

So revised plan:

1. gotoempty (room_1)
2. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2
3. toggle yellow_door_1
4. gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1
5. gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_4
6. toggle red_door_1
7. gotoobject grey_box_2 room_2
8. pick grey_box_2 room_2
9. gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_4
10. gotoroom room_2 room_4 red_door_1
11. drop grey_box_2 room_4 (now in front of it)
12. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_3
13. toggle yellow_door_2
14. gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_2
15. gotoobject yellow_box_2 room_3
16. pick yellow_box_2 room_3
17. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_3 room_4
18. gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_2
19. gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2
20. gotoroom room_4 room_2 red_door_1
21. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_1
22. gotoroom room_2 room_1 yellow_door_1
23. gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3
24. drop yellow_box_2 room_1 (now in front of it)
25. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2
26. gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1
27. gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_4
28. gotoroom room_2 room_4 red_door_1
29. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_3
30. gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_2
31. gotoobject grey_box_3 room_3

Wait, but step 24's drop action requires that the agent is in front of an empty position. However, after step 23, the agent is in front of green_door_1. To drop yellow_box_2, they need to be in front of an empty spot. So they need to gotoempty first.

Thus, after step 23 (in front of green_door_1), the agent needs to:

24. gotoempty room_1
25. drop yellow_box_2 room_1

Then proceed.

So steps:

23. gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3
24. gotoempty room_1
25. drop yellow_box_2 room_1
26. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2
27. gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1
28. gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_4
29. gotoroom room_2 room_4 red_door_1
30. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_3
31. gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_2
32. gotoobject grey_box_3 room_3

This reduces the steps to 32. Let's check if this works.

Checking preconditions:

- After step 11 (drop grey_box_2), agent is in front of it. To goto yellow_door_2 (step 12), they can do it directly because being in front of grey_box_2 doesn't block the door's position. So allowed.

- After step 25 (drop yellow_box_2), agent is in front of it. To goto yellow_door_1 (step 26), they can go directly, as being in front of yellow_box_2 doesn't block the door. So allowed.

This reduces the plan by two steps. Now, the plan has 32 steps. Let's verify each constraint:

- At least one state with holding something or grey_box_3 in room_1: agent holds grey_box_2 and yellow_box_2, so satisfied.

- green_door_1 remains locked always: yes.

- Been in room_1: yes.

- When in room_1, either in front of purple_box_1 or grey_box_2 in room_4: grey_box_2 is in room_4 after step 11, so whenever the agent is in room_1 (steps 1-4, 22-25), after step 11, grey_box_2 is in room_4. Thus, the condition holds.

- red_door_1 unlocked: yes in step 6.

- Been in room_3: yes.

- When in room_3 (steps 14-16, 30-32), prior state holding yellow_box_2: yes.

- Been in front of green_door_1: step 23.

- When in front of green_door_1 (step 23), prior state holding yellow_box_2: yes (steps 16-25).

- At least one state with empty in room_1 or in front of yellow_box_2: after step 25, agent is in front of yellow_box_2, so satisfied.

All constraints are met. This plan is shorter than the previous version, so it's more optimal. Therefore, this is the optimal plan.
