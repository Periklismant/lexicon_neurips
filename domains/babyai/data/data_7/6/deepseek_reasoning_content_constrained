Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. Hmm, the goal is to be in front of a yellow door that connects room_3 and room_1, which must be unlocked. From the initial state, the yellow_door_1 is locked and connects room_1 and room_3. But the constraints are tricky. Let me break it down.

First, the initial state: the agent is in room_4. The yellow_door_1 is locked and connects room_1 and room_3. The goal requires being in front of this door when it's unlocked. But the constraints say the agent can never be in room_3 (so must stay out of there), and purple_door_1 must always be locked. Also, there are various conditions about being in front of certain doors and holding objects.

Constraints to remember:
- Must hold an object at least once.
- Never enter room_3.
- Purple_door_1 is always locked.
- Must be in front of yellow_door_1 and purple_door_1 at some point.
- When in front of yellow_door_1, must have held an object before.
- When in front of purple_door_1, must have been in room_1 or held an object before.
- yellow_door_1 must be unlocked at some point, which requires having held yellow_ball_1 before.

So, the key steps would involve:
1. Unlocking yellow_door_1 by toggling it, which requires being in front of it. But to unlock it, the agent must have held yellow_ball_1 first.
2. Since yellow_ball_1 is in room_2, the agent needs to get there. But how? The agent starts in room_4. To get to room_2, the red_door_1 connects room_4 and room_2. But red_door_1 is locked. Need to unlock it. Wait, but how? To toggle a door, you need to be in front of it. So the agent must go to red_door_1 in room_4, which connects to room_2. But red_door_1 is in room_4 and room_2. Wait, the initial state says "room_4 and room_2 are connected via red_door_1", so the agent is in room_4. So first, the agent can go to red_door_1 from room_4, then toggle it to unlock. Then go through red_door_1 to room_2. But wait, the action gotoroom requires the door to be unlocked. So steps would be:

- gotoempty (since starting in room_4, maybe there's an empty spot)
- gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2 (but need to check if there's an object blocking. In room_4, red_box_2, blue_ball_2, green_ball_1 are present. Are any of them blocking red_door_1? The problem doesn't specify positions, but the preconditions for gotodoor require that there's no object blocking the position in front of the door. If the agent can go to the door unless an object is in front. Assuming that in room_4, red_door_1's position isn't blocked. So gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2. Then toggle red_door_1 to unlock it. Then gotoroom room_4 room_2 red_door_1. Now in room_2.

In room_2, the yellow_ball_1 is present. So the agent can pick it up. But to pick, need to be in front of it. So gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2. Then pick yellow_ball_1 room_2. Now holding it. Then, the agent needs to get back to room_1 to access yellow_door_1? But room_1 is connected via green_door_1 to room_2. But green_door_1 is locked. Wait, but room_1 is connected to room_2 via green_door_1. So to get to room_1 from room_2, the agent would need to go through green_door_1. But green_door_1 is locked. So need to unlock it. But how? The agent is in room_2. To toggle green_door_1, the agent must be in front of it. So first, gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_1. If there's no object blocking, then toggle it. But in room_2, there's grey_box_1, yellow_box_1, yellow_ball_1 (but the agent has picked up yellow_ball_1, so it's no longer there). So after picking yellow_ball_1, maybe the door isn't blocked. So steps:

After getting to room_2, pick up yellow_ball_1. Then, gotoempty? Or gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_1. If possible. Then toggle green_door_1 (unlock it), then gotoroom room_2 room_1 green_door_1. Now in room_1. Then, go to yellow_door_1 (which connects room_1 and room_3). But the agent can't enter room_3, so must stay in room_1. So gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3. Then toggle it (unlock). Then the agent is in front of yellow_door_1, which is unlocked, satisfying the goal.

But wait, the goal is to have a door d that is yellow, connects room_3 and room_1, and the agent is in front of it, and it's not locked. yellow_door_1 fits that. So after unlocking it, the agent is in front of it in room_1. That would satisfy the goal.

But there are constraints to check. Let's check each constraint:

1. Must hold an object at least once. Picking yellow_ball_1 satisfies that.

2. Never enter room_3. The agent goes from room_4 to room_2, then to room_1. No room_3, so good.

3. Purple_door_1 is always locked. The agent never interacts with it, so it remains locked. Good.

4. Must be in front of yellow_door_1. Achieved when toggling it.

5. When in front of yellow_door_1, must have held an object before. Yes, after picking yellow_ball_1.

6. Must be in front of purple_door_1 at some point. The agent starts in room_4. purple_door_1 connects room_4 and room_3. Since the agent is in room_4, can they go to purple_door_1? But since purple_door_1 is locked, and the agent needs to gotodoor. So perhaps after dropping the ball, they can go to purple_door_1 in room_4. But when? Let's see.

Wait, the constraint says the agent must be in front of purple_door_1 in some state. So the plan must include that. Also, when they are in front of purple_door_1, they must have been in room_1 or holding an object before. So maybe after unlocking yellow_door_1, the agent can go back to room_4 via room_2, then goto purple_door_1 in room_4. But how?

Alternatively, after the main steps, the agent can go to purple_door_1. Let's think:

After achieving the goal (in front of yellow_door_1, unlocked), the agent needs to also be in front of purple_door_1 at some point. Let's say after completing the goal steps, the agent can return to room_4. For example, from room_1, go back to room_2 via green_door_1 (if unlocked), then to room_4 via red_door_1. Then in room_4, goto purple_door_1. But since purple_door_1 is locked, but the agent is just going in front of it, not passing through. So steps:

After unlocking yellow_door_1 in room_1, the agent can go back to room_2 (if green_door_1 is now unlocked), then to room_4 via red_door_1 (which was unlocked earlier). Then in room_4, gotoempty, then gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_3. Then they are in front of purple_door_1. At this point, they are not holding any object (since they might have dropped the yellow_ball_1 earlier). But the constraint for being in front of purple_door_1 requires that before that, they were either in room_1 or holding an object. So, if they were in room_1 before, that's okay. The path from room_1 to room_2 to room_4 would have them in room_1 earlier. So that satisfies the condition.

Also, the constraint that when in front of purple_door_1, there's an earlier state where they were in room_1 or holding something. Since they were in room_1 before, that's okay.

So the steps would be:

1. From room_4, go to red_door_1 (room_4 to room_2) â€“ gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2.

2. Toggle red_door_1 to unlock it.

3. Go to room_2 via red_door_1.

4. In room_2, gotoobject yellow_ball_1.

5. Pick yellow_ball_1.

6. Gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_1.

7. Toggle green_door_1 to unlock it.

8. Gotoroom room_2 room_1 green_door_1.

9. Gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3.

10. Toggle yellow_door_1 (unlocks it).

11. Now, in front of yellow_door_1, which is unlocked. Goal achieved. But need to satisfy being in front of purple_door_1.

12. So, from room_1, go back to room_2 via green_door_1 (which is now unlocked).

13. Then go back to room_4 via red_door_1.

14. In room_4, gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_3.

15. Now in front of purple_door_1. 

Also, check the constraint that when unlocking yellow_door_1, the agent had held yellow_ball_1, which they did. Also, the constraint that when in front of yellow_door_1, they had held an object before (they did). 

But wait, after step 10, they are in front of yellow_door_1, which is unlocked. So that's the goal. But the other constraints need to be met. Let's check all constraints:

- At least once holding an object: yes, when they picked yellow_ball_1.

- Never in room_3: correct.

- Purple_door_1 always locked: yes, since the agent never toggles it, so it remains locked.

- In front of yellow_door_1: yes, step 10.

- When in front of yellow_door_1, earlier state holding object: yes, step 5.

- In front of purple_door_1: step 14.

- When in front of purple_door_1, earlier state in room_1 or holding: they were in room_1 in step 8-10, so yes.

- yellow_door_1 is not locked (step 10), which required having held yellow_ball_1 (step5).

So the plan seems to satisfy all constraints. Now, the order of steps.

Let's outline the plan step by step:

1. gotoempty (to move away from any initial position, but maybe not necessary if already in front of nothing. Since the agent starts in room_4, and the initial state doesn't mention being in front of anything. So maybe first action is gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2.

But the gotodoor requires that there's no object blocking the position. In room_4, there are objects: red_box_2, blue_ball_2, green_ball_1. If any of these are blocking the door, then gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2 is not possible. But the problem doesn't specify positions of objects relative to doors. Assuming that doors are accessible unless specified otherwise. So proceed.

Action 1: gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2.

Effect: in front of red_door_1.

Action 2: toggle red_door_1. Now it's unlocked.

Action 3: gotoroom room_4 room_2 red_door_1. Now in room_2.

Action 4: gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2.

Action 5: pick yellow_ball_1 room_2. Now holding it.

Action 6: gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_1. 

Action 7: toggle green_door_1. Unlocks it.

Action 8: gotoroom room_2 room_1 green_door_1. Now in room_1.

Action 9: gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3.

Action 10: toggle yellow_door_1. Now it's unlocked.

This achieves the goal. Now, need to handle the purple_door_1 constraint. So after step 10, the agent is in room_1, in front of yellow_door_1. Now, they need to get to room_4 to face purple_door_1.

So:

Action 11: gotoroom room_1 room_2 green_door_1. (Back to room_2)

Action 12: gotoroom room_2 room_4 red_door_1. (Back to room_4)

Action 13: gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_3.

This puts them in front of purple_door_1. Now, check the constraints for this action:

When they are in front of purple_door_1 (action13), there must have been a prior state where they were in room_1 or holding an object. They were in room_1 in action8-10, and earlier steps. So that's satisfied.

But after action5, they are holding yellow_ball_1. When do they drop it? Because in step11 and 12, they need to be holding it to drop it? Wait, the constraints don't require holding it after, but the agent can't carry it forever. Wait, the problem's goal doesn't require anything about the ball, so the agent can drop it anywhere. But to drop, they need to be in a room and have an empty spot. However, the constraints only require holding an object at least once, which is satisfied in action5.

So the agent can drop the ball in room_1 after unlocking yellow_door_1, but that's optional. But in the current plan, the agent is still holding the ball when they go back to room_2 and room_4. Because the pick action is step5, and they never drop it. Wait, but in action9 (gotodoor) requires that the agent is in the same room as the door. So they are in room_1 when they goto yellow_door_1. The pick action is in room_2, then they move to room_1. So they are carrying the ball into room_1. Then, when they go back to room_2 (action11), they are carrying it. Then to room_4 (action12), still holding it. Then in room_4, to gotodoor purple_door_1, they need to be in room_4. But to drop the ball, they need to be in front of an empty spot. So maybe after step10, the agent should drop the ball in room_1.

But dropping is not required unless necessary. However, the plan as currently outlined has the agent holding the ball when they go back to room_2 and room_4. However, when they do gotoroom actions, they can still be holding the ball. The problem is when they need to perform actions that require not holding anything, but in this plan, after step5, the agent holds the ball until they drop it.

But the constraints don't require holding it after. So perhaps after unlocking yellow_door_1, the agent can drop the ball in room_1. Let's see:

After step10 (toggle yellow_door_1), the agent is in front of yellow_door_1 in room_1, holding the ball. They need to drop it to proceed. Because when moving to room_2, they can carry it, but when they need to gotoempty or gotodoor again, maybe not necessary. But the plan can proceed with the agent still holding the ball.

Wait, the 'drop' action requires being in front of an empty position. So after step10, the agent is in front of yellow_door_1. To drop the ball, they need to gotoempty first. So:

Action11: gotoempty (in room_1)

Action12: drop yellow_ball_1 room_1.

Then proceed to go back to room_2. But adding these steps increases the plan length. However, since the problem requires an optimal (shortest) plan, we need to check if this is necessary.

Alternatively, maybe the agent can drop the ball in room_2 when returning. Let's see:

After step10 (in room_1, front of yellow_door_1, holding ball):

Action11: gotoroom room_1 room_2 green_door_1. (Requires green_door_1 is unlocked, which it is after step7)

Now in room_2, still holding the ball.

Action12: gotoempty room_2.

Action13: drop yellow_ball_1 room_2.

But why drop it? Because the agent needs to perform gotodoor or other actions, but if they are carrying the ball, they can still proceed. However, when they need to toggle purple_door_1, but they don't need to. Wait, the agent only needs to be in front of purple_door_1, not toggle it. So they can be holding the ball when they are in front of purple_door_1. But when they are in front of purple_door_1, they must have been in room_1 or holding an object before. Since they were in room_1 earlier, that's satisfied even if they aren't holding the ball anymore. So perhaps dropping the ball is unnecessary. But holding it doesn't prevent any actions except those that require empty hands (like picking another object, but that's not needed here).

But the agent has to get back to room_4. So:

Action11: gotoroom room_1 room_2 green_door_1.

Action12: gotoroom room_2 room_4 red_door_1.

Now in room_4, still holding the ball.

Action13: gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_3.

Now in front of purple_door_1. Now, the agent is holding the ball, which satisfies the condition for being in front of purple_door_1 (since they are holding an object, which meets the 'at least one' condition). But the constraint when in front of purple_door_1 requires that in an earlier state, they were in room_1 or holding an object. Since they were in room_1 (step8), even if they are holding the ball now, it's okay. But the constraint is satisfied either way.

However, the plan would then end with the agent holding the ball, which is allowed as long as the goal is achieved. The goal doesn't require dropping the ball. So the agent can stay holding it.

But the problem requires that the plan must be optimal (shortest possible). So if we can avoid unnecessary steps like dropping, that's better.

So the initial plan steps would be:

1. gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2

2. toggle red_door_1

3. gotoroom room_4 room_2 red_door_1

4. gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2

5. pick yellow_ball_1 room_2

6. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_1

7. toggle green_door_1

8. gotoroom room_2 room_1 green_door_1

9. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3

10. toggle yellow_door_1

11. gotoroom room_1 room_2 green_door_1

12. gotoroom room_2 room_4 red_door_1

13. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_3

So this is 13 actions. But maybe there's a shorter path. Let's see.

Alternatively, after step10 (in front of yellow_door_1, unlocked), can the agent immediately go to purple_door_1 from room_1? But how? The agent is in room_1. To get to room_4, they need to go back through room_2. So steps 11-13 are needed.

Is there a shorter way to satisfy the purple_door_1 front condition? For example, before going to room_1, the agent could go to purple_door_1 from room_4 earlier. Let me see.

Wait, the agent starts in room_4. Before doing anything else, they can goto purple_door_1 in room_4. But the constraint when they do that requires that they were in room_1 or holding an object before. But at the start, they haven't been in room_1 or held any object. So that would violate the constraint. Therefore, they can't go to purple_door_1 in the initial steps. They need to first either go to room_1 or hold an object.

So the earliest they can goto purple_door_1 is after holding the yellow_ball_1 (step5) or after entering room_1 (step8). So steps 13 (gotodoor purple_door_1) must come after step5 or step8.

But in the current plan, step13 is after step12, which is after returning to room_4. That's okay.

Alternatively, after step3 (in room_2), the agent could goto purple_door_1 from room_4, but they are in room_2. So no. They have to get back to room_4 first.

Hmm. So the plan as outlined seems necessary. Now, checking if all constraints are met:

- Must hold an object: yes, step5.

- Never in room_3: yes.

- purple_door_1 remains locked: the agent never toggles it, so yes.

- In front of yellow_door_1: step9-10.

- When in front of yellow_door_1, held object before: yes, step5.

- In front of purple_door_1: step13.

- When in front of purple_door_1, earlier state in room_1 (step8) or holding (step5 onwards): yes.

- yellow_door_1 is unlocked (step10), which required holding yellow_ball_1 (step5).

Yes, all constraints are satisfied.

Now, count the steps:

1. gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2

2. toggle red_door_1

3. gotoroom room_4 room_2 red_door_1

4. gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2

5. pick yellow_ball_1 room_2

6. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_1

7. toggle green_door_1

8. gotoroom room_2 room_1 green_door_1

9. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3

10. toggle yellow_door_1

11. gotoroom room_1 room_2 green_door_1

12. gotoroom room_2 room_4 red_door_1

13. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_3

That's 13 actions. Is there a shorter way? Let's think.

Is there a way to avoid going back to room_4? For example, after step10, can the agent go to room_4 via another route? But room_1 is connected to room_3 via yellow_door_1, but room_3 is forbidden. So no. So the only way is back through room_2 and room_4.

Alternatively, after step8 (in room_1), can the agent goto purple_door_1 from room_4? No, because they are in room_1. To get to room_4, they need to go back through room_2.

So the steps seem necessary. Therefore, this plan is optimal.
