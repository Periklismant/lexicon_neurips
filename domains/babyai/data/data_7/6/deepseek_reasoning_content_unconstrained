Okay, let's see. The goal is to have a yellow door that connects room_3 and room_1, be in front of it, and have it unlocked. Also, all doors start locked. So, first, check which doors are yellow. The initial state says yellow_door_1 is yellow and connects room_1 and room_3. So that's the door we need. The goal is to be in front of yellow_door_1, which is unlocked.

The initial state: I'm in room_4. All doors are locked. So I need to get to yellow_door_1, which is between room_1 and room_3. To unlock it, I need to toggle it, which requires being in front of it. But to get there, I have to navigate through the rooms. Let's see the connections.

From room_4, connected to room_2 via red_door_1 and to room_3 via purple_door_1. Both doors are locked. So I can't go directly. But maybe I can unlock them. Wait, but to unlock a door, I need to be in front of it. But how do I get there if the doors are locked?

Wait, the doors are in the rooms. For example, to go to a door connecting room_4 and room_3 (purple_door_1), I can go in front of it from room_4. But the door is locked. But the action "gotodoor" requires that there's no object blocking the position in front of the door. Are any objects blocking? Let's check the initial state. In room_4, there are red_box_2, blue_ball_2, green_ball_1. But are they blocking the door? The problem description says that objects can block doors. But the initial state doesn't mention any blocking. So maybe by default, they are not blocking unless specified. Wait, the effect of "drop" says that if x was blocking a door, then it's no longer blocking. So maybe the initial state doesn't have any objects blocking doors. So the preconditions for gotodoor would be met as long as I'm in the correct room.

Wait, for "gotodoor d r1 r2", I can perform it if I'm in r1 or r2. Since purple_door_1 connects room_4 and room_3. So from room_4, I can go to purple_door_1. But since it's locked, can I go through? No, but to toggle it, I need to be in front of it. So maybe I can go to the door, toggle it (unlock), then go through.

So the plan might be:

Start in room_4. Go to purple_door_1 (gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_3). Then toggle it to unlock. Then go to room_3 via purple_door_1. Once in room_3, then go to yellow_door_1 (connecting room_3 and room_1). But yellow_door_1 is locked. So I need to unlock that. So from room_3, go to yellow_door_1 (gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1). Then toggle it. Then the door is unlocked, and I'm in front of it. That would satisfy the goal.

Wait, but the goal requires that the door is not locked, connected to room_3 and room_1, is yellow, and I'm in front of it. So if I unlock yellow_door_1, then that's the door.

But how do I get from room_4 to room_3? Let's see:

1. In room_4, go to purple_door_1 (gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room3). Preconditions: I'm in a room connected by the door (room_4 is connected via purple_door_1), and no object is blocking. Since initial state doesn't mention any blocking objects, this should be okay. Then toggle purple_door_1 (unlock). Then use gotoroom to go from room4 to room3 via purple_door_1. Then in room3, go to yellow_door_1 (gotodoor yellow_door_1 room3 room1). Toggle to unlock. Now, yellow_door_1 is unlocked, and I'm in front of it. That's the goal.

So the steps would be:

1. gotodoor purple_door_1 room4 room3 (from room4, which I'm in)
2. toggle purple_door_1 (unlocks it)
3. gotoroom room4 room3 purple_door_1 (move to room3)
4. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room3 room1 (now in room3)
5. toggle yellow_door_1 (unlocks it)

At step 5, after toggling, the door is unlocked, and I'm in front of it. That meets all the goal conditions: door is yellow (yes, yellow_door_1 is yellow), connects room3 and room1, I'm in front of it, and it's not locked.

But wait, initial state says yellow_door_1 is locked. So after toggling it once, it becomes unlocked. So step 5 would unlock it. Then the goal is achieved.

So the plan would be those five steps. Let's check if each step's preconditions are met.

1. gotodoor purple_door_1 room4 room3: I'm in room4, which is connected via purple_door_1. No blocking objects (assuming). So this is allowed. After this, I'm in front of purple_door_1.

2. toggle purple_door_1: I'm in front of it, so allowed. This unlocks it.

3. gotoroom room4 room3 purple_door_1: door is now unlocked. Precondition met. Move to room3. Now in room3.

4. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room3 room1: in room3, door connects to room1. No blocking objects. So allowed. Now in front of yellow_door_1.

5. toggle yellow_door_1: in front of it. Toggle unlocks it. Now it's unlocked.

That's five actions. Is there a shorter plan? Let's see. Maybe there's a way to go through other doors. For example, from room4 to room2 via red_door_1. But red_door_1 is locked. To unlock it, I need to go to it. So:

Alternative path:

1. gotodoor red_door_1 room4 room2 (but red_door_1 connects room2 and room4. From room4, can I go to red_door_1? Yes. Then toggle it, unlock. Then go to room2. Then from room2 to room1 via green_door_1 (which is locked). Then need to unlock green_door_1. But that's more steps. So original path is better.

So the first plan is optimal. Five steps. Let me check if all actions are possible.

Yes, each step's preconditions are met. So the plan should be:

```
gotoempty
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_3
toggle purple_door_1
gotoroom room_4 room_3 purple_door_1
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1
toggle yellow_door_1
```

Wait, wait, first action. Wait, initial state: the agent is in room_4. But do they start in front of an object or door? The initial state doesn't mention being in front of anything. So the initial position is not in front of any object or door. So perhaps the first action isn't needed. Wait, the first action is "gotoempty". But according to the problem, the initial state may not have the agent in front of any object. So maybe the first action is unnecessary. Let's re-examine.

The initial state says "you are in room_4" and "you have visited room_4". There's no mention of being in front of any object. So the agent is in room_4 but not in front of anything. So to perform "gotodoor", they need to be in front of the door. Wait, no. The "gotodoor" action moves them in front of the door. Wait, the preconditions for "gotodoor d r1 r2" are that they are in a room connected by d (room4 for purple_door_1), and that there's no object blocking. So the action "gotodoor purple_door_1 room4 room3" can be executed from room4, even if not in front of anything. Because the effect is that they are now in front of the door. So the first action can be "gotodoor purple_door_1 room4 room3" directly. The initial state is not in front of anything, so no need to "gotoempty" first. So the initial steps can be:

1. gotodoor purple_door_1 room4 room3 (now in front of purple_door_1)
2. toggle purple_door_1 (unlock)
3. gotoroom room4 room3 purple_door_1 (move to room3)
4. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room3 room1 (now in front of yellow_door_1)
5. toggle yellow_door_1 (unlock)

That's five actions. No need for the initial gotoempty. Because the agent can directly go to the door from their current position, which is not in front of any object. The "gotodoor" action's effect is that they are now in front of the door, regardless of previous position. So the initial steps are possible without first going to an empty spot. Thus, the plan is five steps. That seems optimal.
