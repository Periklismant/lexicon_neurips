Alright, I'm faced with a gridworld planning problem. Let me understand the problem step by step.

Given:
1. A 2D gridworld with 4 rooms arranged in a square: room_1 (NW), room_2 (SW), room_3 (NE), room_4 (SE).
2. 4 doors connecting the rooms: 
   - green_door_1 connects room_1 and room_2
   - yellow_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3
   - red_door_1 connects room_2 and room_4
   - purple_door_1 connects room_3 and room_4
3. There are boxes and balls in the gridworld.
4. I can perform several actions like moving, picking up objects, dropping them, and toggling doors.

Initial State:
- I am in room_4
- All doors are locked
- Various objects are distributed across the rooms

Goal:
- There exists a door d such that d is yellow, d connects room_3 and room_1, I am in front of d, and d is not locked.

Looking at the initial state, I see that yellow_door_1 is the door connecting room_1 and room_3, and it's yellow. So, the goal is to be in front of yellow_door_1 while it's unlocked.

Constraints:
1. At some point, I must be holding an object.
2. I can never be in room_3.
3. purple_door_1 must always remain locked.
4. At some point, I must be in front of yellow_door_1.
5. Before I can be in front of yellow_door_1, I must have held an object at some point.
6. At some point, I must be in front of purple_door_1.
7. Before I can be in front of purple_door_1, I must have either been in room_1 or held an object.
8. At some point, yellow_door_1 must be unlocked.
9. Before yellow_door_1 can be unlocked, I must have held yellow_ball_1.

Let's think through this:

1. I can't be in room_3, but I need to be in front of yellow_door_1, which connects room_1 and room_3. This means I need to be in room_1 in front of yellow_door_1.
2. I need to pick up yellow_ball_1 at some point so that I can unlock yellow_door_1.
3. I need to go to room_2 to pick up yellow_ball_1.
4. I also need to be in front of purple_door_1, and before doing so, I must either be in room_1 or hold an object.

So, a high-level plan would be:
1. From room_4, go to room_2 via red_door_1.
2. In room_2, pick up yellow_ball_1.
3. Go back to room_4 from room_2.
4. Go in front of purple_door_1 (after holding yellow_ball_1 which satisfies the constraint).
5. Go to room_1 via room_2.
6. Go in front of yellow_door_1.
7. Drop yellow_ball_1 (if needed).
8. Toggle yellow_door_1 (unlock it).

But, there's an issue: I need to toggle red_door_1 to go from room_4 to room_2, but I need to be in front of it in room_4 first. And similarly, for other doors.

Let's refine the plan:
1. In room_4, go in front of red_door_1.
2. Toggle red_door_1 (unlock it).
3. Go to room_2 from room_4 via red_door_1.
4. In room_2, go in front of green_door_1.
5. Toggle green_door_1 (unlock it).
6. Pick up yellow_ball_1 in room_2.
7. Go to room_1 from room_2 via green_door_1.
8. In room_1, go in front of yellow_door_1.
9. Drop yellow_ball_1.
10. Toggle yellow_door_1 (unlock it).

Hmm, but I also need to be in front of purple_door_1 at some point. Let's adjust:
1. In room_4, go in front of purple_door_1.
2. (This fulfills the constraint: Before I can be in front of purple_door_1, I need to have been in room_1 or held an object. I haven't been in room_1, so I'll need to hold an object before this step. Let's pick up an object in room_4 first).
3. In room_4, go in front of an object (e.g., red_box_2).
4. Pick up red_box_2.
5. Go in front of purple_door_1 with red_box_2 in hand.
6. Go in front of red_door_1.
7. Toggle red_door_1 (unlock it).
8. Drop red_box_2 (if needed).
9. Go to room_2 from room_4 via red_door_1.
10. In room_2, go in front of yellow_ball_1.
11. Pick up yellow_ball_1.
12. Go in front of green_door_1.
13. Toggle green_door_1 (unlock it).
14. Go to room_1 from room_2 via green_door_1.
15. In room_1, go in front of yellow_door_1.
16. Toggle yellow_door_1 (unlock it).

But wait, I need to be holding yellow_ball_1 before I can unlock yellow_door_1 (constraint 9). Let's adjust again:
1. In room_4, go in front of red_box_2.
2. Pick up red_box_2.
3. Go in front of purple_door_1 with red_box_2 in hand.
4. Drop red_box_2 (to free up my hand).
5. Go in front of red_door_1.
6. Toggle red_door_1 (unlock it).
7. Go to room_2 from room_4 via red_door_1.
8. In room_2, go in front of yellow_ball_1.
9. Pick up yellow_ball_1.
10. Go in front of green_door_1.
11. Toggle green_door_1 (unlock it).
12. Go to room_1 from room_2 via green_door_1.
13. In room_1, go in front of yellow_door_1.
14. Toggle yellow_door_1 (unlock it).

But there's still an issue: after unlocking yellow_door_1, I'll be in front of it but it's not enough to fulfill the goal if I've already dropped yellow_ball_1. I need to be in front of yellow_door_1 while it's unlocked.

Actually, let's step back and think more clearly about the goal:
"There is a door d such that d is yellow, room_3 and room_1 are connected via d, you are in front of d, d is not locked."

And the constraints:
"The following expression must hold in every state: "you are not in room_3""
"If expression "yellow_door_1 is not locked" holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: "you are holding yellow_ball_1""

So, the goal is to be in front of yellow_door_1 while it's unlocked. And, before I can unlock yellow_door_1, I must have held yellow_ball_1 at some point (but I don't necessarily need to be holding it while unlocking yellow_door_1).

Let's adjust the plan again:
1. In room_4, go in front of red_box_2.
2. Pick up red_box_2.
3. Go in front of purple_door_1 with red_box_2 in hand.
4. Drop red_box_2 (to free up my hand).
5. Go in front of red_door_1.
6. Toggle red_door_1 (unlock it).
7. Go to room_2 from room_4 via red_door_1.
8. In room_2, go in front of yellow_ball_1.
9. Pick up yellow_ball_1.
10. Go in front of green_door_1.
11. Toggle green_door_1 (unlock it).
12. Go to room_1 from room_2 via green_door_1.
13. In room_1, go in front of yellow_door_1.
14. Drop yellow_ball_1 (to free up my hand).
15. Toggle yellow_door_1 (unlock it).
16. Go in front of yellow_door_1.

But wait, step 16 is unnecessary because after toggling the door, I remain in front of it.

Let's check if this plan satisfies all constraints:
1. At some point, I hold an object. ✓ (I hold red_box_2 and later yellow_ball_1)
2. I never enter room_3. ✓ (The plan doesn't involve entering room_3)
3. purple_door_1 remains locked. ✓ (I don't toggle purple_door_1)
4. At some point, I'm in front of yellow_door_1. ✓ (Step 13)
5. Before being in front of yellow_door_1, I've held an object. ✓ (I've held red_box_2 and yellow_ball_1)
6. At some point, I'm in front of purple_door_1. ✓ (Step 3)
7. Before being in front of purple_door_1, I've either been in room_1 or held an object. ✓ (I've held red_box_2)
8. At some point, yellow_door_1 is unlocked. ✓ (Step 15)
9. Before yellow_door_1 is unlocked, I've held yellow_ball_1. ✓ (Step 9)

But now I'm noticing something: the 14th step "Drop yellow_ball_1" is not necessary for the constraints and the goal.  I could keep holding yellow_ball_1 while unlocking yellow_door_1. 

Let's refine the plan one more time:
1. In room_4, go in front of red_box_2.
2. Pick up red_box_2.
3. Go in front of purple_door_1 with red_box_2 in hand.
4. Drop red_box_2 (to free up my hand).
5. Go in front of red_door_1.
6. Toggle red_door_1 (unlock it).
7. Go to room_2 from room_4 via red_door_1.
8. In room_2, go in front of yellow_ball_1.
9. Pick up yellow_ball_1.
10. Go in front of green_door_1.
11. Toggle green_door_1 (unlock it).
12. Go to room_1 from room_2 via green_door_1.
13. In room_1, go in front of yellow_door_1.
14. Toggle yellow_door_1 (unlock it).

Actually, wait.  I now realize that if we look at the "toggle" action, the condition for "toggle" says "you may only toggle a door d if you are in front of d."  But it doesn't say anything about whether the hands need to be empty or not. That means I can toggle a door while holding an object.

Let's refine the plan once more:
1. In room_4, go in front of red_box_2.
2. Pick up red_box_2.
3. Go in front of purple_door_1 with red_box_2 in hand.
4. Go in front of red_door_1 (still holding red_box_2).
5. Toggle red_door_1 (unlock it, still holding red_box_2).
6. Go to room_2 from room_4 via red_door_1 (still holding red_box_2).
7. Drop red_box_2 in room_2.
8. In room_2, go in front of yellow_ball_1.
9. Pick up yellow_ball_1.
10. Go in front of green_door_1 (holding yellow_ball_1).
11. Toggle green_door_1 (unlock it, holding yellow_ball_1).
12. Go to room_1 from room_2 via green_door_1 (holding yellow_ball_1).
13. In room_1, go in front of yellow_door_1 (holding yellow_ball_1).
14. Toggle yellow_door_1 (unlock it, holding yellow_ball_1).

This plan satisfies all constraints.

But let me check the initial state and actions one more time to ensure there aren't any issues or oversights.

The initial state mentions:
- I'm in room_4.
- red_box_2, blue_ball_2, and green_ball_1 are in room_4.

That still fits with my plan.

Let me now be more specific with the actions for the plan. I'll break down each step in detail:

1. `gotoobject red_box_2 room_4` (Go in front of red_box_2 in room_4)
2. `pick red_box_2 room_4` (Pick up red_box_2 in room_4)
3. `gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_3` (Go in front of purple_door_1 in room_4)
4. `gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2` (Go in front of red_door_1 in room_4)
5. `toggle red_door_1` (Unlock red_door_1)
6. `gotoroom room_4 room_2 red_door_1` (Go to room_2 from room_4 via red_door_1)
7. `gotoempty` (Go in front of an empty position in room_2)
8. `drop red_box_2 room_2` (Drop red_box_2 in room_2)
9. `gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2` (Go in front of yellow_ball_1 in room_2)
10. `pick yellow_ball_1 room_2` (Pick up yellow_ball_1 in room_2)
11. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_1` (Go in front of green_door_1 in room_2)
12. `toggle green_door_1` (Unlock green_door_1)
13. `gotoroom room_2 room_1 green_door_1` (Go to room_1 from room_2 via green_door_1)
14. `gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3` (Go in front of yellow_door_1 in room_1)
15. `toggle yellow_door_1` (Unlock yellow_door_1)

This should be a valid plan that fulfills all the constraints and the goal.

But wait, there might be room for optimization. Maybe I don't need to pick up red_box_2 at all?

The constraint "At some point, I must be holding an object" can be satisfied by holding yellow_ball_1.
The constraint "Before I can be in front of purple_door_1, I must have either been in room_1 or held an object" means that I can be in front of purple_door_1 after I pick up yellow_ball_1.

Let's try to optimize:

1. In room_4, go in front of red_door_1.
2. Toggle red_door_1 (unlock it).
3. Go to room_2 from room_4 via red_door_1.
4. In room_2, go in front of yellow_ball_1.
5. Pick up yellow_ball_1.
6. Go back to room_4 from room_2 via red_door_1.
7. Go in front of purple_door_1 (holding yellow_ball_1).
8. Go in front of red_door_1.
9. Go to room_2 from room_4 via red_door_1 (holding yellow_ball_1).
10. Go in front of green_door_1 (holding yellow_ball_1).
11. Toggle green_door_1 (unlock it, holding yellow_ball_1).
12. Go to room_1 from room_2 via green_door_1 (holding yellow_ball_1).
13. In room_1, go in front of yellow_door_1 (holding yellow_ball_1).
14. Toggle yellow_door_1 (unlock it, holding yellow_ball_1).

Actually, hang on a second. The constraint "If expression "you are in front of purple_door_1" holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: "At least one of the following conditions is true: "you are in room_1", "you are holding some object"" means I need to have either been in room_1 or held an object before (specifically "earlier state") I am in front of purple_door_1. This means I need to pick up an object first or be in room_1 before going in front of purple_door_1.

Also, the constraint "If expression "you are in front of yellow_door_1" holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: "you are holding some object"" means I need to have held an object before (specifically "earlier state") I am in front of yellow_door_1.

So, I think the first plan is more valid for the constraints. Let's go with that.

1. `gotoobject red_box_2 room_4` (Go in front of red_box_2 in room_4)
2. `pick red_box_2 room_4` (Pick up red_box_2 in room_4)
3. `gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_3` (Go in front of purple_door_1 in room_4)
4. `gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2` (Go in front of red_door_1 in room_4)
5. `toggle red_door_1` (Unlock red_door_1)
6. `gotoroom room_4 room_2 red_door_1` (Go to room_2 from room_4 via red_door_1)
7. `gotoempty` (Go in front of an empty position in room_2)
8. `drop red_box_2 room_2` (Drop red_box_2 in room_2)
9. `gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2` (Go in front of yellow_ball_1 in room_2)
10. `pick yellow_ball_1 room_2` (Pick up yellow_ball_1 in room_2)
11. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_1` (Go in front of green_door_1 in room_2)
12. `toggle green_door_1` (Unlock green_door_1)
13. `gotoroom room_2 room_1 green_door_1` (Go to room_1 from room_2 via green_door_1)
14. `gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3` (Go in front of yellow_door_1 in room_1)
15. `toggle yellow_door_1` (Unlock yellow_door_1)

Wait, actually this could be optimized further. The constraint says "there must be an earlier state", not "the immediately prior state". So, I could pick up an object, drop it, and then go in front of purple_door_1. But let's ensure I've understood all the constraints correctly:

Constraints:
1. At some point, I must be holding an object. (Satisfied by picking up red_box_2 or yellow_ball_1)
2. I can never be in room_3. (The plan doesn't involve entering room_3)
3. purple_door_1 must always remain locked. (I don't toggle purple_door_1)
4. At some point, I must be in front of yellow_door_1. (Step 14)
5. Before I can be in front of yellow_door_1, I must have held an object at some point. (I've held red_box_2 from steps 2-8 and yellow_ball_1 from step 10 onwards)
6. At some point, I must be in front of purple_door_1. (Step 3)
7. Before I can be in front of purple_door_1, I must have either been in room_1 or held an object. (I've held red_box_2 from steps 2-8)
8. At some point, yellow_door_1 must be unlocked. (Step 15)
9. Before yellow_door_1 can be unlocked, I must have held yellow_ball_1. (I pick up yellow_ball_1 in step 10)

My interpretation is correct. The plan satisfies all constraints and the goal.

Let's review the plan once more:

1. `gotoobject red_box_2 room_4` (Go in front of red_box_2 in room_4)
2. `pick red_box_2 room_4` (Pick up red_box_2 in room_4)
3. `gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_3` (Go in front of purple_door_1 in room_4)
4. `gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2` (Go in front of red_door_1 in room_4)
5. `toggle red_door_1` (Unlock red_door_1)
6. `gotoroom room_4 room_2 red_door_1` (Go to room_2 from room_4 via red_door_1)
7. `gotoempty` (Go in front of an empty position in room_2)
8. `drop red_box_2 room_2` (Drop red_box_2 in room_2)
9. `gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2` (Go in front of yellow_ball_1 in room_2)
10. `pick yellow_ball_1 room_2` (Pick up yellow_ball_1 in room_2)
11. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_1` (Go in front of green_door_1 in room_2)
12. `toggle green_door_1` (Unlock green_door_1)
13. `gotoroom room_2 room_1 green_door_1` (Go to room_1 from room_2 via green_door_1)
14. `gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3` (Go in front of yellow_door_1 in room_1)
15. `toggle yellow_door_1` (Unlock yellow_door_1)

This plan should work.

But I think I can further optimize to avoid dropping red_box_2. Since I've already held red_box_2 to satisfy the purple_door_1 constraint, I can just keep holding it while going to room_2, but then I won't be able to pick up yellow_ball_1. I'll have to drop red_box_2 at some point.

1. `gotoobject red_box_2 room_4`
2. `pick red_box_2 room_4`
3. `gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_3`
4. `gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2`
5. `toggle red_door_1`
6. `gotoroom room_4 room_2 red_door_1`
7. `gotoempty`
8. `drop red_box_2 room_2`
9. `gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2`
10. `pick yellow_ball_1 room_2`
11. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_1`
12. `toggle green_door_1`
13. `gotoroom room_2 room_1 green_door_1`
14. `gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3`
15. `toggle yellow_door_1`

I believe this plan is optimized. But let's check the initial state and constraints one more time:

Initial State:
- I am in room_4
- All doors are locked
- I'm not holding any object.
- red_box_2, blue_ball_2, and green_ball_1 are in room_4.
- yellow_ball_1 is in room_2.

Constraints:
1. At some point, I must be holding an object. (Satisfied by picking up red_box_2 in step 2 and yellow_ball_1 in step 10)
2. I can never be in room_3. (The plan doesn't involve entering room_3)
3. purple_door_1 must always remain locked. (I don't toggle purple_door_1)
4. At some point, I must be in front of yellow_door_1. (Step 14)
5. Before I can be in front of yellow_door_1, I must have held an object at some point. (I've held red_box_2 and yellow_ball_1)
6. At some point, I must be in front of purple_door_1. (Step 3)
7. Before I can be in front of purple_door_1, I must have either been in room_1 or held an object. (I've held red_box_2 from steps 2-8, which is before step 3)
8. At some point, yellow_door_1 must be unlocked. (Step 15)
9. Before yellow_door_1 can be unlocked, I must have held yellow_ball_1. (I pick up yellow_ball_1 in step 10)

The plan appears to satisfy all constraints and the goal. I'll reiterate:

1. `gotoobject red_box_2 room_4`
2. `pick red_box_2 room_4`
3. `gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_3`
4. `gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2`
5. `toggle red_door_1`
6. `gotoroom room_4 room_2 red_door_1`
7. `gotoempty`
8. `drop red_box_2 room_2`
9. `gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2`
10. `pick yellow_ball_1 room_2`
11. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_1`
12. `toggle green_door_1`
13. `gotoroom room_2 room_1 green_door_1`
14. `gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3`
15. `toggle yellow_door_1`

Ok, so this appears to be a valid plan that achieves the goals and satisfies the constraints.

Let me read through the problem statement one more time. Actually, hold on. Let's just double-check if I can pick up yellow_ball_1 directly, without first picking up red_box_2.

The 7th constraint says: "Before I can be in front of purple_door_1, I must have either been in room_1 or held an object."

If I can get to room_1 without going through room_3 (which I can't be in due to constraint 2), I can satisfy this constraint.

From room_4, I can go to room_2 (via red_door_1), then to room_1 (via green_door_1). But these doors are initially locked, so I need to unlock them. However, to toggle a door, I need to be in front of it. This means I need to go to the door, but the 7th constraint says I need to have either been in room_1 or held an object before going in front of purple_door_1. 

This creates a circular dependency: To be in room_1, I need to unlock green_door_1, which requires me to be in front of it in room_2. To get to room_2, I need to unlock red_door_1, which requires me to be in front of it in room_4. But to be in front of purple_door_1, I need to have either been in room_1 (which I haven't been to yet) or held an object (which I need to pick up).

So it seems I do need to pick up an object first.

Still, I wonder if I can go to room_1 without going through purple_door_1. Let's think about the layout. From the connections:
- room_1 and room_2 are connected via green_door_1.
- room_1 and room_3 are connected via yellow_door_1.
- room_2 and room_4 are connected via red_door_1.
- room_3 and room_4 are connected via purple_door_1.

From room_4, I can get to room_1 by:
1. Go to room_2 (via red_door_1)
2. Go to room_1 (via green_door_1)

Wait a minute, I'm still confused. Constraint 6 says "At some point, I must be in front of purple_door_1." But constraint 7 says "Before I can be in front of purple_door_1, I must have either been in room_1 or held an object."

Alright, the 6th constraint mandates that I must be in front of purple_door_1 at some point, and the 7th constraint says I must have either been in room_1 or held an object before being in front of purple_door_1. To satisfy these, I can do one of two things:
1. Pick up an object, then go in front of purple_door_1.
2. Go to room_1, then go in front of purple_door_1.

Option 1 fits my current plan. Let's check if Option 2 is feasible:
From room_4 (my starting location), I can go to room_2 (via red_door_1), then to room_1 (via green_door_1). But to do this, I need to toggle red_door_1 and green_door_1. For that, I need to be in front of red_door_1 in room_4 and then in front of green_door_1 in room_2. 

In fact, the constraint 7 says I need to have been in room_1 or held an object before being in front of purple_door_1. It doesn't restrict me from being in front of other doors.

So, I can:
1. Go in front of red_door_1 in room_4.
2. Toggle red_door_1.
3. Go to room_2 from room_4.
4. Go in front of green_door_1 in room_2.
5. Toggle green_door_1.
6. Go to room_1 from room_2.
7. Go back to room_2 from room_1.
8. Go back to room_4 from room_2.
9. Go in front of purple_door_1 in room_4.

But, I also need to satisfy constraint 8, which says yellow_door_1 must be unlocked at some point, and constraint 9, which says I must have held yellow_ball_1 before unlocking yellow_door_1. Given that I need to be holding yellow_ball_1 to unlock yellow_door_1, I'll have to pick it up.

The best place to pick up yellow_ball_1 is in room_2, since that's where it's located. 

Given all of this, I think the optimal plan is as follows:

1. Go in front of red_door_1 in room_4.
2. Toggle red_door_1.
3. Go to room_2 from room_4.
4. Pick up yellow_ball_1 in room_2.
5. Go in front of green_door_1 in room_2.
6. Toggle green_door_1.
7. Go to room_1 from room_2.
8. Go in front of yellow_door_1 in room_1.
9. Toggle yellow_door_1.
10. Go back to room_2 from room_1.
11. Go back to room_4 from room_2.
12. Go in front of purple_door_1 in room_4.

Oops, I think I'm overthinking. Wiat, let me rethink the constraints.

The 7th constraint says "Before I can be in front of purple_door_1, I must have either been in room_1 or held an object."

OK, so I need to either have been to room_1 or held an object before I go in front of purple_door_1. One way of meeting that requirement is to pick up an object in room_4 (such as red_box_2). Then I can go in front of purple_door_1.

But what if I first go to room_1 and then come back to room_4 to be in front of purple_door_1? That would also satisfy the constraint.

Let's see if I can get to room_1 from my starting position in room_4:
1. Go in front of red_door_1 in room_4.
2. Toggle red_door_1.
3. Go to room_2 from room_4.
4. Go in front of green_door_1 in room_2.
5. Toggle green_door_1.
6. Go to room_1 from room_2.

Now I've been to room_1, which means I can go in front of purple_door_1 without having held an object.

But I also need to pick up yellow_ball_1 at some point to unlock yellow_door_1. The best place to do this is in room_2 on my way back from room_1 to room_4.

Let me adjust the plan:
1. `gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2` (Go in front of red_door_1 in room_4)
2. `toggle red_door_1` (Unlock red_door_1)
3. `gotoroom room_4 room_2 red_door_1` (Go to room_2 from room_4)
4. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_1` (Go in front of green_door_1 in room_2)
5. `toggle green_door_1` (Unlock green_door_1)
6. `gotoroom room_2 room_1 green_door_1` (Go to room_1 from room_2)
7. `gotoroom room_1 room_2 green_door_1` (Go back to room_2 from room_1)
8. `gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2` (Go in front of yellow_ball_1 in room_2)
9. `pick yellow_ball_1 room_2` (Pick up yellow_ball_1 in room_2)
10. `gotoroom room_2 room_4 red_door_1` (Go back to room_4 from room_2)
11. `gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_3` (Go in front of purple_door_1 in room_4)
12. `gotoroom room_4 room_2 red_door_1` (Go back to room_2 from room_4)
13. `gotoroom room_2 room_1 green_door_1` (Go back to room_1 from room_2)
14. `gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3` (Go in front of yellow_door_1 in room_1)
15. `toggle yellow_door_1` (Unlock yellow_door_1)

OK, so I think the above is a valid plan, but I can simplify. 

Constraints:
1. At some point, I must be holding an object. (Satisfied by picking up yellow_ball_1)
2. I can never be in room_3. (The plan doesn't involve entering room_3)
3. purple_door_1 must always remain locked. (I don't toggle purple_door_1)
4. At some point, I must be in front of yellow_door_1. (Step 14)
5. Before I can be in front of yellow_door_1, I must have held an object at some point. (I've held yellow_ball_1)
6. At some point, I must be in front of purple_door_1. (Step 11)
7. Before I can be in front of purple_door_1, I must have either been in room_1 or held an object. (I've been to room_1 in step 6)
8. At some point, yellow_door_1 must be unlocked. (Step 15)
9. Before yellow_door_1 can be unlocked, I must have held yellow_ball_1. (I pick up yellow_ball_1 in step 9)

This plan satisfies all constraints and the goal. 

Let me just double-check that I've understood the problem correctly, and there isn't a more efficient solution.

To achieve the goal "There is a door d such that 'd is yellow', 'room_3 and room_1 are connected via d', 'you are in front of d', 'd is not locked'", I need to be in room_1, in front of yellow_door_1, with yellow_door_1 unlocked. To do this, I need to have held yellow_ball_1 at some point.

My final answer is:

1. `gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2` (Go in front of red_door_1 in room_4)
2. `toggle red_door_1` (Unlock red_door_1)
3. `gotoroom room_4 room_2 red_door_1` (Go to room_2 from room_4)
4. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_1` (Go in front of green_door_1 in room_2)
5. `toggle green_door_1` (Unlock green_door_1)
6. `gotoroom room_2 room_1 green_door_1` (Go to room_1 from room_2)
7. `gotoroom room_1 room_2 green_door_1` (Go back to room_2 from room_1)
8. `gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2` (Go in front of yellow_ball_1 in room_2)
9. `pick yellow_ball_1 room_2` (Pick up yellow_ball_1 in room_2)
10. `gotoroom room_2 room_4 red_door_1` (Go back to room_4 from room_2)
11. `gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_3` (Go in front of purple_door_1 in room_4)
12. `gotoroom room_4 room_2 red_door_1` (Go back to room_2 from room_4)
13. `gotoroom room_2 room_1 green_door_1` (Go back to room_1 from room_2)
14. `gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3` (Go in front of yellow_door_1 in room_1)
15. `toggle yellow_door_1` (Unlock yellow_door_1)

I'm thinking I might be able to optimize it a bit more.

After picking up yellow_ball_1 in step 9, I go to room_4, then to purple_door_1, then back to room_2, and finally to room_1 to toggle yellow_door_1. But I could also just be in front of purple_door_1 after step 6, and then continue with the plan.

Let me refine:
1. `gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2` (Go in front of red_door_1 in room_4)
2. `toggle red_door_1` (Unlock red_door_1)
3. `gotoroom room_4 room_2 red_door_1` (Go to room_2 from room_4)
4. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_1` (Go in front of green_door_1 in room_2)
5. `toggle green_door_1` (Unlock green_door_1)
6. `gotoroom room_2 room_1 green_door_1` (Go to room_1 from room_2)
7. `gotoroom room_1 room_2 green_door_1` (Go back to room_2 from room_1)
8. `gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2` (Go in front of yellow_ball_1 in room_2)
9. `pick yellow_ball_1 room_2` (Pick up yellow_ball_1 in room_2)
10. `gotoroom room_2 room_1 green_door_1` (Go back to room_1 from room_2)
11. `gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3` (Go in front of yellow_door_1 in room_1)
12. `toggle yellow_door_1` (Unlock yellow_door_1)
13. `gotoroom room_1 room_2 green_door_1` (Go back to room_2 from room_1)
14. `gotoroom room_2 room_4 red_door_1` (Go back to room_4 from room_2)
15. `gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_3` (Go in front of purple_door_1 in room_4)

OK, wait a second, there are a lot of issues here. Let me go back over the goal and constraints one more time.

Goal: To be in room_1 in front of yellow_door_1, with yellow_door_1 unlocked.

Constraints:
1. At some point, I must be holding an object.
2. I can never be in room_3.
3. purple_door_1 must always remain locked.
4. At some point, I must be in front of yellow_door_1.
5. Before I can be in front of yellow_door_1, I must have held an object at some point.
6. At some point, I must be in front of purple_door_1.
7. Before I can be in front of purple_door_1, I must have either been in room_1 or held an object.
8. At some point, yellow_door_1 must be unlocked.
9. Before yellow_door_1 can be unlocked, I must have held yellow_ball_1.

OK now I'm starting to get confused again because I misunderstood the layout. The goal state is to be in front of yellow_door_1 in room_1, with yellow_door_1 unlocked. After I unlock yellow_door_1, constraint 6 requires me to be in front of purple_door_1 at some point. But I've also met constraint 7 because I've been to room_1.

So, I can actually wait to be in front of purple_door_1 until after I've unlocked yellow_door_1. That's more efficient:

1. `gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2` (Go in front of red_door_1 in room_4)
2. `toggle red_door_1` (Unlock red_door_1)
3. `gotoroom room_4 room_2 red_door_1` (Go to room_2 from room_4)
4. `gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2` (Go in front of yellow_ball_1 in room_2)
5. `pick yellow_ball_1 room_2` (Pick up yellow_ball_1 in room_2)
6. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_1` (Go in front of green_door_1 in room_2)
7. `toggle green_door_1` (Unlock green_door_1)
8. `gotoroom room_2 room_1 green_door_1` (Go to room_1 from room_2)
9. `gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3` (Go in front of yellow_door_1 in room_1)
10. `toggle yellow_door_1` (Unlock yellow_door_1)
11. `gotoroom room_1 room_2 green_door_1` (Go back to room_2 from room_1)
12. `gotoroom room_2 room_4 red_door_1` (Go back to room_4 from room_2)
13. `gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_3` (Go in front of purple_door_1 in room_4)

OK the plan above is good. Let me double check one more time.

The goal is satisfied after step 10, when I am in front of yellow_door_1 in room_1 and it's unlocked.
Constraint 1 is satisfied by picking up yellow_ball_1 in step 5.
Constraint 2 is satisfied because I never enter room_3.
Constraint 3 is satisfied because I never toggle purple_door_1.
Constraint 4 is satisfied by step 9.
Constraint 5 is satisfied because I've held yellow_ball_1 before being in front of yellow_door_1.
Constraint 6 is satisfied by step 13.
Constraint 7 is satisfied because I've been to room_1 (step 8) before being in front of purple_door_1 (step 13).
Constraint 8 is satisfied by step 10.
Constraint 9 is satisfied because I've held yellow_ball_1 (step 5) before unlocking yellow_door_1 (step 10).

But there's a gotcha: after step 10, I'm still holding yellow_ball_1. The goal has been achieved, but I continue the plan to fulfill constraint 6 (being in front of purple_door_1 at some point). Steps 11-13 are "cleanup steps" to ensure constraint 6 is met.

If I can't drop yellow_ball_1 after achieving the goal, that might be an issue. But the goal says I need to be in front of yellow_door_1 with it unlocked. It doesn't say I can't be holding something.

So, I think the final plan is:

1. `gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2` (Go in front of red_door_1 in room_4)
2. `toggle red_door_1` (Unlock red_door_1)
3. `gotoroom room_4 room_2 red_door_1` (Go to room_2 from room_4)
4. `gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2` (Go in front of yellow_ball_1 in room_2)
5. `pick yellow_ball_1 room_2` (Pick up yellow_ball_1 in room_2)
6. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_1` (Go in front of green_door_1 in room_2)
7. `toggle green_door_1` (Unlock green_door_1)
8. `gotoroom room_2 room_1 green_door_1` (Go to room_1 from room_2)
9. `gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3` (Go in front of yellow_door_1 in room_1)
10. `toggle yellow_door_1` (Unlock yellow_door_1)
11. `gotoroom room_1 room_2 green_door_1` (Go back to room_2 from room_1)
12. `gotoroom room_2 room_4 red_door_1` (Go back to room_4 from room_2)
13. `gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_3` (Go in front of purple_door_1 in room_4)

Actually, I've seen I could further optimize the plan, because I'm toggling green_door_1 after I've picked up yellow_ball_1. This means I'm holding yellow_ball_1 when I toggle green_door_1. Let's check the constraints for the "toggle" action to see if this is allowed.

The precondition for "toggle" says "you may only toggle a door d if you are in front of d." It doesn't say I can't be holding an object. So, toggling green_door_1 while holding yellow_ball_1 is valid.

Given this, I think the plan is as optimal as it can be.

1. `gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2` (Go in front of red_door_1 in room_4)
2. `toggle red_door_1` (Unlock red_door_1)
3. `gotoroom room_4 room_2 red_door_1` (Go to room_2 from room_4)
4. `gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2` (Go in front of yellow_ball_1 in room_2)
5. `pick yellow_ball_1 room_2` (Pick up yellow_ball_1 in room_2)
6. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_1` (Go in front of green_door_1 in room_2)
7. `toggle green_door_1` (Unlock green_door_1)
8. `gotoroom room_2 room_1 green_door_1` (Go to room_1 from room_2)
9. `gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3` (Go in front of yellow_door_1 in room_1)
10. `toggle yellow_door_1` (Unlock yellow_door_1)
11. `gotoroom room_1 room_2 green_door_1` (Go back to room_2 from room_1)
12. `gotoroom room_2 room_4 red_door_1` (Go back to room_4 from room_2)
13. `gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_3` (Go in front of purple_door_1 in room_4)

This is our final answer to the problem.

Actually, wait—I'm thinking about the goal again. Now I realize that after accomplishing the goal, there is no need to continue fulfilling the constraints because constraints are enforced before the goal. Once the goal is achieved, the constraints are no longer relevant. If that's the case, I should just end the plan after step 10.

But to be sure, let's double-check if all constraints were fulfilled by step 10:

1. At some point, I must be holding an object. ✓ (I hold yellow_ball_1 from steps 5-10 and beyond)
2. I can never be in room_3. ✓ (I don't enter room_3)
3. purple_door_1 must always remain locked. ✓ (I don't toggle purple_door_1)
4. At some point, I must be in front of yellow_door_1. ✓ (Step 9)
5. Before I can be in front of yellow_door_1, I must have held an object at some point. ✓ (I've held yellow_ball_1 from steps 5 onwards)
6. At some point, I must be in front of purple_door_1. ✗ (Not satisfied by step 10)
7. Before I can be in front of purple_door_1, I must have either been in room_1 or held an object. ✓ (I've been to room_1 and held yellow_ball_1)
8. At some point, yellow_door_1 must be unlocked. ✓ (Step 10)
9. Before yellow_door_1 can be unlocked, I must have held yellow_ball_1. ✓ (I pick up yellow_ball_1 in step 5)

Constraint 6 is not satisfied by step 10, which means the plan must continue beyond step 10 to be in front of purple_door_1 at some point. So our final answer is the full plan:

1. `gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2` (Go in front of red_door_1 in room_4)
2. `toggle red_door_1` (Unlock red_door_1)
3. `gotoroom room_4 room_2 red_door_1` (Go to room_2 from room_4)
4. `gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2` (Go in front of yellow_ball_1 in room_2)
5. `pick yellow_ball_1 room_2` (Pick up yellow_ball_1 in room_2)
6. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_1` (Go in front of green_door_1 in room_2)
7. `toggle green_door_1` (Unlock green_door_1)
8. `gotoroom room_2 room_1 green_door_1` (Go to room_1 from room_2)
9. `gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3` (Go in front of yellow_door_1 in room_1)
10. `toggle yellow_door_1` (Unlock yellow_door_1)
11. `gotoroom room_1 room_2 green_door_1` (Go back to room_2 from room_1)
12. `gotoroom room_2 room_4 red_door_1` (Go back to room_4 from room_2)
13. `gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_3` (Go in front of purple_door_1 in room_4)

Actually, now I'm second-guessing myself. The problem says, "bring about the goal of the problem while satisfying all constraints." That suggests that I need to satisfy all the constraints in the process of achieving the goal.

So the question is: is there a better way of satisfying the constraint to to be in front of purple_door_1 at some point, other than doing so after achieving the goal?

What if, after step 2, I inserted steps to go to purple_door_1?
1. `gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2` (Go in front of red_door_1 in room_4)
2. `toggle red_door_1` (Unlock red_door_1)
3. `gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_3` (Go in front of purple_door_1 in room_4)

But wait, constraint 7 says "Before I can be in front of purple_door_1, I must have either been in room_1 or held an object." I haven't been to room_1 yet, and I haven't held an object yet. 

So, I do need to be in front of purple_door_1 at the end, after achieving the goal. 

So the final plan is:
1. `gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2` (Go in front of red_door_1 in room_4)
2. `toggle red_door_1` (Unlock red_door_1)
3. `gotoroom room_4 room_2 red_door_1` (Go to room_2 from room_4)
4. `gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2` (Go in front of yellow_ball_1 in room_2)
5. `pick yellow_ball_1 room_2` (Pick up yellow_ball_1 in room_2)
6. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_1` (Go in front of green_door_1 in room_2)
7. `toggle green_door_1` (Unlock green_door_1)
8. `gotoroom room_2 room_1 green_door_1` (Go to room_1 from room_2)
9. `gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3` (Go in front of yellow_door_1 in room_1)
10. `toggle yellow_door_1` (Unlock yellow_door_1)
11. `gotoroom room_1 room_2 green_door_1` (Go back to room_2 from room_1)
12. `gotoroom room_2 room_4 red_door_1` (Go back to room_4 from room_2)
13. `gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_3` (Go in front of purple_door_1 in room_4)

Actually, I want to prove that constraint 7 is satisfied in the above plan. Constraint 7 says: "Before I can be in front of purple_door_1, I must have either been in room_1 or held an object."

In the plan, I'm in front of purple_door_1 at step 13. Before that, I held yellow_ball_1 from steps 5-13, and I was in room_1 from steps 8-11. So constraint 7 is satisfied.

Let me check if the plan is optimal. I don't think there's a shorter valid plan, because:
1. I need to unlock red_door_1 to get to room_2 (steps 1-2).
2. I need to pick up yellow_ball_1 in room_2 (steps 3-5).
3. I need to unlock green_door_1 to get to room_1 (steps 6-7).
4. I need to unlock yellow_door_1 in room_1 (steps 8-10).
5. I need to go in front of purple_door_1 to satisfy constraint 6 (steps 11-13).

All of these steps are necessary (I can't skip any steps in the plan). So the plan is optimal.

1. `gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2` (Go in front of red_door_1 in room_4)
2. `toggle red_door_1` (Unlock red_door_1)
3. `gotoroom room_4 room_2 red_door_1` (Go to room_2 from room_4)
4. `gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2` (Go in front of yellow_ball_1 in room_2)
5. `pick yellow_ball_1 room_2` (Pick up yellow_ball_1 in room_2)
6. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_1` (Go in front of green_door_1 in room_2)
7. `toggle green_door_1` (Unlock green_door_1)
8. `gotoroom room_2 room_1 green_door_1` (Go to room_1 from room_2)
9. `gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3` (Go in front of yellow_door_1 in room_1)
10. `toggle yellow_door_1` (Unlock yellow_door_1)
11. `gotoroom room_1 room_2 green_door_1` (Go back to room_2 from room_1)
12. `gotoroom room_2 room_4 red_door_1` (Go back to room_4 from room_2)
13. `gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_3` (Go in front of purple_door_1 in room_4)

This is the final answer.
