Let's understand the problem. I need to create a plan to achieve the goal "There is a ball v such that 'The following conditions are all true: 'v is grey', 'you are in front of v''" with several constraints.

From the initial state, I am in room_3, and there is a grey ball (grey_ball_1) also in room_3. So the goal state can be achieved by simply going to the grey ball in room_3. However, I also need to satisfy several constraints:

1. At some point, green_door_1 is unlocked and I'm in front of green_ball_2. green_ball_2 is in room_3, and green_door_1 connects room_1 and room_2. So I'll need to unlock green_door_1 at some point and be in front of green_ball_2.

2. At some point, either I am holding some object or grey_box_2 is in room_2. grey_box_2 is in room_3, so I could move it to room_2 or pick up some object.

3. At some point, either green_door_2 is unlocked or I am in front of grey_box_2. green_door_2 connects room_2 and room_4. grey_box_2 is in room_3. So I can either unlock green_door_2 or go in front of grey_box_2.

4. At some point, I am in room_4 and red_door_1 is unlocked. red_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3. So I need to visit room_4 and unlock red_door_1.

5. At some point, either yellow_ball_1 is in room_3 or I am in front of green_ball_1. yellow_ball_1 is in room_1, green_ball_1 is in room_2. So I can either move yellow_ball_1 to room_3 or go in front of green_ball_1.

6. At some point, either I am holding grey_box_2 or I am in room_4. grey_box_2 is in room_3. So I can either pick up grey_box_2 or visit room_4.

7. At some point, I am in front of green_ball_2. green_ball_2 is in room_3.

Let me think about a plan:

Starting in room_3, I can first go in front of green_ball_2 (constraint 7) and then in front of grey_box_2 (part of constraint 3).

Then, I can pick up grey_box_2, which satisfies the "you are holding some object" part of constraint 2 and the "you are holding grey_box_2" part of constraint 6.

Now, I can move to room_1 via red_door_1, but it's locked. So I need to go to the door first and unlock it.

```
gotoobject green_ball_2 room_3
gotoobject grey_box_2 room_3
pick grey_box_2 room_3
gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1
toggle red_door_1
```

Now red_door_1 is unlocked (part of constraint 4).

Next, I go to room_1. After being in room_1, I can drop grey_box_2 (since I've already satisfied constraint 2 and constraint 6) and pick up yellow_ball_1.

```
gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1
gotoempty
drop grey_box_2 room_1
gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_1
pick yellow_ball_1 room_1
```

Now I can go back to room_3, which would place yellow_ball_1 in room_3 (part of constraint 5).

```
gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3
gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1
gotoempty
drop yellow_ball_1 room_3
```

Now I need to go to room_2 to see green_ball_1 (another option for constraint 5), but first I'll need to unlock green_door_1.

```
gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1
gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1
gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_2
toggle green_door_1
```

Now green_door_1 is unlocked.

Let's go to room_2, in front of green_ball_1.

```
gotoroom room_1 room_2 green_door_1
gotoobject green_ball_1 room_2
```

Now, I'm in front of green_ball_1, which satisfies the other part of constraint 5.

To satisfy constraint 1, I need to go back to room_3 in front of green_ball_2 while green_door_1 is still unlocked.

```
gotodoor green_door_2 room_2 room_4
toggle green_door_2
```

Now green_door_2 is unlocked (part of constraint 3).

```
gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_2
```

Now I'm in room_4 (part of constraint 4 and constraint 6).

I need to go to room_3 to be in front of green_ball_2 while green_door_1 is still unlocked (constraint 1).

```
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3
toggle grey_door_1
gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1
gotoobject green_ball_2 room_3
```

Now I'm in front of green_ball_2 while green_door_1 is unlocked (constraint 1), and I've also satisfied constraint 7 again.

Finally, I need to go in front of grey_ball_1 to satisfy the goal.

```
gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_3
```

Let me walk through the entire plan again to check if it's valid and satisfies all constraints:

```
gotoobject green_ball_2 room_3  # Constraints 7
gotoobject grey_box_2 room_3  # Part of constraint 3
pick grey_box_2 room_3  # Part of constraints 2 and 6
gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1
toggle red_door_1  # red_door_1 is unlocked
gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1
gotoempty
drop grey_box_2 room_1
gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_1
pick yellow_ball_1 room_1
gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3
gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1
gotoempty
drop yellow_ball_1 room_3  # Part of constraint 5: yellow_ball_1 is in room_3
gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1
gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1
gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_2
toggle green_door_1  # green_door_1 is unlocked
gotoroom room_1 room_2 green_door_1
gotoobject green_ball_1 room_2  # Part of constraint 5: you are in front of green_ball_1
gotodoor green_door_2 room_2 room_4
toggle green_door_2  # Part of constraint 3: green_door_2 is not locked
gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_2  # Part of constraints 4 and 6: you are in room_4
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3
toggle grey_door_1
gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1
gotoobject green_ball_2 room_3  # Constraint 1: green_door_1 is not locked and you are in front of green_ball_2
gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_3  # Goal: you are in front of grey_ball_1
```

Wait, there's a problem with constraint 4: "you are in room_4" and "red_door_1 is not locked". I unlocked red_door_1 but then locked it again before going to room_4. Let me revise the plan.

Let's rethink this:

1. For constraint 1, I need to be in front of green_ball_2 while green_door_1 is unlocked.
2. For constraint 2, I need to either be holding an object or move grey_box_2 to room_2.
3. For constraint 3, I need to either unlock green_door_2 or be in front of grey_box_2.
4. For constraint 4, I need to be in room_4 while red_door_1 is unlocked.
5. For constraint 5, I need to either move yellow_ball_1 to room_3 or be in front of green_ball_1.
6. For constraint 6, I need to either hold grey_box_2 or be in room_4.
7. For constraint 7, I need to be in front of green_ball_2.

Let's revise the plan:

```
gotoobject green_ball_2 room_3  # Constraint 7
gotoobject grey_box_2 room_3  # Part of constraint 3
pick grey_box_2 room_3  # Part of constraints 2 and 6
gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1
toggle red_door_1  # red_door_1 is unlocked
gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1
gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_2
toggle green_door_1  # green_door_1 is unlocked
gotoroom room_1 room_2 green_door_1
gotoempty
drop grey_box_2 room_2  # Part of constraint 2: grey_box_2 is in room_2
gotoobject green_ball_1 room_2  # Part of constraint 5: you are in front of green_ball_1
gotodoor green_door_2 room_2 room_4
toggle green_door_2  # Part of constraint 3: green_door_2 is not locked
gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_2  # Part of constraints 4 and 6: you are in room_4
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3
toggle grey_door_1
gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1
gotoobject green_ball_2 room_3  # Constraint 1: green_door_1 is not locked and you are in front of green_ball_2
gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_3  # Goal: you are in front of grey_ball_1
```

But wait, there's still a problem with constraint 4. When I'm in room_4, red_door_1 might be locked again if I locked it at some point. Let me reconsider the entire plan.

Actually, let me rethink this. The constraint doesn't specify that I need to execute any actions in room_4 while red_door_1 is unlocked. I just need to be in room_4 at some point while red_door_1 is unlocked at the same time. So I can unlock red_door_1, then go to room_4, and as long as I don't lock red_door_1 again, constraint 4 is satisfied.

So, let's come up with a new plan:

1. First, go in front of green_ball_2 (constraint 7).
2. Then, go in front of grey_box_2 (part of constraint 3).
3. Pick up grey_box_2 (part of constraints 2 and 6).
4. Go to and unlock red_door_1.
5. Go to room_1.
6. Go to and unlock green_door_1.
7. Go to room_2.
8. Go in front of green_ball_1 (part of constraint 5).
9. Drop grey_box_2 in room_2 (part of constraint 2).
10. Go to and unlock green_door_2 (part of constraint 3).
11. Go to room_4 (part of constraints 4 and 6).
12. Go to and unlock grey_door_1.
13. Go back to room_3.
14. Go in front of green_ball_2 again (constraint 1, as green_door_1 is still unlocked).
15. Finally, go in front of grey_ball_1 to satisfy the goal.

Let's write out the full plan:

```
gotoobject green_ball_2 room_3  # Constraint 7
gotoobject grey_box_2 room_3  # Part of constraint 3
pick grey_box_2 room_3  # Part of constraints 2 and 6
gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1
toggle red_door_1  # red_door_1 is unlocked
gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1
gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_2
toggle green_door_1  # green_door_1 is unlocked
gotoroom room_1 room_2 green_door_1
gotoobject green_ball_1 room_2  # Part of constraint 5: you are in front of green_ball_1
gotoempty
drop grey_box_2 room_2  # Part of constraint 2: grey_box_2 is in room_2
gotodoor green_door_2 room_2 room_4
toggle green_door_2  # Part of constraint 3: green_door_2 is not locked
gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_2  # Part of constraints 4 and 6: you are in room_4 while red_door_1 is unlocked
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3
toggle grey_door_1
gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1
gotoobject green_ball_2 room_3  # Constraint 1: green_door_1 is not locked and you are in front of green_ball_2
gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_3  # Goal: you are in front of grey_ball_1
```

Actually let me check again if the above plan satisifes all the constraints correctly:

1. "The following conditions are all true: 'green_door_1 is not locked', 'you are in front of green_ball_2'". This is satisfied in the second-to-last step.

2. "At least one of the following conditions is true: 'you are holding some object', 'grey_box_2 is in room_2'". This is satisfied after dropping grey_box_2 in room_2.

3. "At least one of the following conditions is true: 'green_door_2 is not locked', 'you are in front of grey_box_2'". This is satisfied after unlocking green_door_2.

4. "The following conditions are all true: 'you are in room_4', 'red_door_1 is not locked'". This is satisfied when I'm in room_4 and red_door_1 is still unlocked.

5. "At least one of the following conditions is true: 'yellow_ball_1 is in room_3', 'you are in front of green_ball_1'". I go in front of green_ball_1 in room_2.

6. "At least one of the following conditions is true: 'you are holding grey_box_2', 'you are in room_4'". Both are satisfied at different points in the plan.

7. "you are in front of green_ball_2". Satisfied at two different points in the plan.

So the plan is valid.

Let me double-check and make sure the plan respects the actions' preconditions:

1. `gotoobject green_ball_2 room_3`: I'm in room_3, and green_ball_2 is in room_3. OK.
2. `gotoobject grey_box_2 room_3`: I'm in room_3, and grey_box_2 is in room_3. OK.
3. `pick grey_box_2 room_3`: I'm in room_3, in front of grey_box_2, and my hands are empty. OK.
4. `gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1`: I'm in room_3, and red_door_1 connects room_3 and room_1. OK.
5. `toggle red_door_1`: I'm in front of red_door_1. OK.
6. `gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1`: I'm in room_3, red_door_1 connects room_3 and room_1, and red_door_1 is unlocked. OK.
7. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_2`: I'm in room_1, and green_door_1 connects room_1 and room_2. OK.
8. `toggle green_door_1`: I'm in front of green_door_1. OK.
9. `gotoroom room_1 room_2 green_door_1`: I'm in room_1, green_door_1 connects room_1 and room_2, and green_door_1 is unlocked. OK.
10. `gotoobject green_ball_1 room_2`: I'm in room_2, and green_ball_1 is in room_2. OK.
11. `gotoempty`: No specific preconditions. OK.
12. `drop grey_box_2 room_2`: I'm holding grey_box_2 and in front of an empty position. OK.
13. `gotodoor green_door_2 room_2 room_4`: I'm in room_2, and green_door_2 connects room_2 and room_4. OK.
14. `toggle green_door_2`: I'm in front of green_door_2. OK.
15. `gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_2`: I'm in room_2, green_door_2 connects room_2 and room_4, and green_door_2 is unlocked. OK.
16. `gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3`: I'm in room_4, and grey_door_1 connects room_4 and room_3. OK.
17. `toggle grey_door_1`: I'm in front of grey_door_1. OK.
18. `gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1`: I'm in room_4, grey_door_1 connects room_4 and room_3, and grey_door_1 is unlocked. OK.
19. `gotoobject green_ball_2 room_3`: I'm in room_3, and green_ball_2 is in room_3. OK.
20. `gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_3`: I'm in room_3, and grey_ball_1 is in room_3. OK.

All preconditions are satisfied. The plan is valid.

Let me actually double-check that the plan satisifes all the constraints correctly:

1. "The following conditions are all true: 'green_door_1 is not locked', 'you are in front of green_ball_2'". This is satisfied in the second-to-last step (step 19), because green_door_1 remains unlocked after step 8.

2. "At least one of the following conditions is true: 'you are holding some object', 'grey_box_2 is in room_2'". This is satisfied after dropping grey_box_2 in room_2 (step 12).

3. "At least one of the following conditions is true: 'green_door_2 is not locked', 'you are in front of grey_box_2'". This is satisfied after unlocking green_door_2 (step 14).

4. "The following conditions are all true: 'you are in room_4', 'red_door_1 is not locked'". This is satisfied when I'm in room_4 (step 15) and red_door_1 is still unlocked (from step 5).

5. "At least one of the following conditions is true: 'yellow_ball_1 is in room_3', 'you are in front of green_ball_1'". I go in front of green_ball_1 in room_2 (step 10).

6. "At least one of the following conditions is true: 'you are holding grey_box_2', 'you are in room_4'". I'm holding grey_box_2 from step 3 to step 12, and I'm in room_4 from step 15 to step 18.

7. "you are in front of green_ball_2". Satisfied in steps 1 and 19.

So the plan is valid and satisfies all the constraints. Let me write the final plan:

```
gotoobject green_ball_2 room_3
gotoobject grey_box_2 room_3
pick grey_box_2 room_3
gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1
toggle red_door_1
gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1
gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_2
toggle green_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_2 green_door_1
gotoobject green_ball_1 room_2
gotoempty
drop grey_box_2 room_2
gotodoor green_door_2 room_2 room_4
toggle green_door_2
gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_2
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3
toggle grey_door_1
gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1
gotoobject green_ball_2 room_3
gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_3
```

That's the final plan. It achieves the goal and satisfies all the constraints.

Actually, I realized that achieving the goal state is very simple—I just need to go in front of the grey ball in room_3. But there are many constraints I need to satisfy along the way. Let me see if I can find a shorter valid plan, since the problem asks for an optimal (i.e., shortest) valid plan.

Let's think about the constraints again and see what actions I actually need to take to satisfy them:

1. For constraint 1, I need to be in front of green_ball_2 while green_door_1 is unlocked.
2. For constraint 2, I need to either be holding an object or move grey_box_2 to room_2.
3. For constraint 3, I need to either unlock green_door_2 or be in front of grey_box_2.
4. For constraint 4, I need to be in room_4 while red_door_1 is unlocked.
5. For constraint 5, I need to either move yellow_ball_1 to room_3 or be in front of green_ball_1.
6. For constraint 6, I need to either hold grey_box_2 or be in room_4.
7. For constraint 7, I need to be in front of green_ball_2.

I actually already satisfied constraint 3 by going in front of grey_box_2 in step 2. And going to room_4 satisfies constraint 6 as well. So I don't need to pick up grey_box_2 for constraint 6; I only need to pick it up for constraint 2, and to satisfy that I can also move grey_box_2 to room_2.

Let me try to shorten the plan:

1. First, go in front of green_ball_2 (constraint 7).
2. Then, go in front of grey_box_2 (constraint 3).
3. Pick up grey_box_2 (part of constraint 2).
4. Go to and unlock red_door_1.
5. Go to room_1.
6. Go to and unlock green_door_1.
7. Go to room_2.
8. Drop grey_box_2 in room_2 (part of constraint 2).
9. Go in front of green_ball_1 (part of constraint 5).
10. Go to and unlock green_door_2.
11. Go to room_4 (part of constraints 4 and 6).
12. Go to and unlock grey_door_1.
13. Go back to room_3.
14. Go in front of green_ball_2 again (constraint 1, as green_door_1 is still unlocked).
15. Finally, go in front of grey_ball_1 to satisfy the goal.

Actually it looks like I can't think of a shorter plan at the moment, so I'll stick with this one. Let's make sure it's still valid:
Actually, let me try a different approach. Let's see if we can use the "gotoempty" action to satisfy the goal more efficiently. For example:

1. Start in room_3.
2. Go in front of grey_box_2 (constraint 3).
3. Go in front of green_ball_2 (constraints 7).
4. Unlock red_door_1.
5. Go to room_1.
6. Unlock green_door_1 (will remain unlocked for constraint 1).
7. Go to room_2.
8. Go in front of green_ball_1 (constraint 5).
9. Unlock green_door_2.
10. Go to room_4 (constraints 4 and 6).
11. Return to room_3.
12. Go in front of green_ball_2 (constraint 1, as green_door_1 is unlocked).
13. Go in front of grey_ball_1 (goal).

This doesn't address constraint 2 though, which requires either holding an object or moving grey_box_2 to room_2. So I need to pick up grey_box_2 and drop it in room_2. But the plan is still shorter because it doesn't use the "gotoempty" and "drop" actions unnecessarily.

Let's verify this plan:

1. `gotoobject grey_box_2 room_3`: I'm in room_3, and grey_box_2 is in room_3. OK.
2. `gotoobject green_ball_2 room_3`: I'm in room_3, and green_ball_2 is in room_3. OK.
3. `pick grey_box_2 room_3`: Oh, gray_box_2 is not in front of me anymore after step 2. So I need to go back to grey_box_2 first.

So it seems like the original plan was more optimal after all. Let me reconsider.

Actually, let me think of another approach. I can simply go to room_2, pick up green_ball_1, and bring it to room_3. Then, I can satisfy constraint 5 by having green_ball_1 in room_3. This might lead to a shorter plan.

Let me try to construct a plan from scratch again:

1. Go in front of green_ball_2 (constraint 7).
2. Go in front of grey_box_2 (constraint 3).
3. Pick up grey_box_2.
4. Go to and unlock red_door_1.
5. Go to room_1.
6. Go to and unlock green_door_1 (will remain unlocked for constraint 1).
7. Go to room_2.
8. Drop grey_box_2 in room_2 (constraint 2).
9. Unlock green_door_2 (constraint 3).
10. Go to room_4 (constraints 4 and 6).
11. Return to room_3.
12. Go in front of green_ball_2 (constraint 1, as green_door_1 is unlocked).
13. Go in front of grey_ball_1 (goal).

This is essentially the plan I had before. Let me double-check if it satisfies all the constraints:

1. "The following conditions are all true: 'green_door_1 is not locked', 'you are in front of green_ball_2'". Satisfied in step 12.
2. "At least one of the following conditions is true: 'you are holding some object', 'grey_box_2 is in room_2'". Satisfied in step 8.
3. "At least one of the following conditions is true: 'green_door_2 is not locked', 'you are in front of grey_box_2'". Satisfied in step 9.
4. "The following conditions are all true: 'you are in room_4', 'red_door_1 is not locked'". Satisfied in step 10, as red_door_1 remains unlocked.
5. "At least one of the following conditions is true: 'yellow_ball_1 is in room_3', 'you are in front of green_ball_1'". I don't think this is satisfied. I need to either move yellow_ball_1 to room_3 or go in front of green_ball_1 in room_2.

Let me revise the plan to include going in front of green_ball_1:

1. Go in front of green_ball_2 (constraint 7).
2. Go in front of grey_box_2 (constraint 3).
3. Pick up grey_box_2.
4. Go to and unlock red_door_1.
5. Go to room_1.
6. Go to and unlock green_door_1 (will remain unlocked for constraint 1).
7. Go to room_2.
8. Go in front of green_ball_1 (constraint 5).
9. Drop grey_box_2 in room_2 (constraint 2).
10. Go to and unlock green_door_2 (constraint 3).
11. Go to room_4 (constraints 4 and 6).
12. Go to and unlock grey_door_1.
13. Go back to room_3.
14. Go in front of green_ball_2 (constraint 1, as green_door_1 is still unlocked).
15. Finally, go in front of grey_ball_1 to satisfy the goal.

Let me double-check that this plan satisfies all the constraints:

1. "The following conditions are all true: 'green_door_1 is not locked', 'you are in front of green_ball_2'". Satisfied in step 14.
2. "At least one of the following conditions is true: 'you are holding some object', 'grey_box_2 is in room_2'". Satisfied in step 9.
3. "At least one of the following conditions is true: 'green_door_2 is not locked', 'you are in front of grey_box_2'". Satisfied in step 10.
4. "The following conditions are all true: 'you are in room_4', 'red_door_1 is not locked'". Satisfied in step 11, as red_door_1 remains unlocked.
5. "At least one of the following conditions is true: 'yellow_ball_1 is in room_3', 'you are in front of green_ball_1'". Satisfied in step 8.
6. "At least one of the following conditions is true: 'you are holding grey_box_2', 'you are in room_4'". Satisfied in steps 3 (holding grey_box_2) and 11 (in room_4).
7. "you are in front of green_ball_2". Satisfied in steps 1 and 14.

So this plan satisfies all the constraints. Let me try to optimize it further.

Let me see if I can find a more efficient path. Going to room_1 and then to room_2 might be unnecessary if I can go from room_3 to room_2 directly. But the rooms are arranged in a square, so there's no direct path from room_3 to room_2. I need to go through either room_1 or room_4. The plan I have goes through room_1, which seems reasonable.

I can't think of a more efficient plan, so I'll stick with this one. Let me check the step logic to satisfy the preconditions one more time and the actions' effects to make sure they're valid.

1. `gotoobject green_ball_2 room_3`: I'm in room_3, and green_ball_2 is in room_3. After this action, I'm in front of green_ball_2.
2. `gotoobject grey_box_2 room_3`: I'm in room_3, and grey_box_2 is in room_3. After this action, I'm in front of grey_box_2 and no longer in front of green_ball_2.
3. `pick grey_box_2 room_3`: I'm in room_3, in front of grey_box_2, and my hands are empty. After this action, I'm holding grey_box_2 and no longer in front of it.

All the actions and their effects are valid. The plan should work!

So the final plan is:

```
gotoobject green_ball_2 room_3
gotoobject grey_box_2 room_3
pick grey_box_2 room_3
gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1
toggle red_door_1
gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1
gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_2
toggle green_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_2 green_door_1
gotoobject green_ball_1 room_2
gotoempty
drop grey_box_2 room_2
gotodoor green_door_2 room_2 room_4
toggle green_door_2
gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_2
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3
toggle grey_door_1
gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1
gotoobject green_ball_2 room_3
gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_3
```

This plan accomplishes the goal and satisfies all the constraints. It's optimal in the sense that I can't think of a shorter valid plan.
