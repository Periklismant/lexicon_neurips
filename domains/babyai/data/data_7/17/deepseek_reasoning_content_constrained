Okay, let's tackle this planning problem step by step. The goal is to get a grey ball in front of me, and there are several constraints that need to be satisfied at some point during the plan. Let me start by understanding the initial state and the goal.

Starting in room_3, which has grey_box_2, yellow_box_1, grey_ball_1, and green_ball_2. The grey_ball_1 is grey, so that's the one I need to be in front of. But wait, the goal is "there exists a ball v such that v is grey and I'm in front of v." So the grey_ball_1 is already in room_3. If I can get in front of it, that's the solution. But maybe there are obstacles or constraints that require other actions.

Looking at the constraints:

1. At some point, green_door_1 must be unlocked and I'm in front of green_ball_2.
2. At some point, either I'm holding something or grey_box_2 is in room_2.
3. At some point, either green_door_2 is unlocked or I'm in front of grey_box_2.
4. At some point, I'm in room_4 and red_door_1 is unlocked.
5. At some point, either yellow_ball_1 is in room_3 or I'm in front of green_ball_1.
6. At some point, either I'm holding grey_box_2 or I'm in room_4.
7. At some point, I'm in front of green_ball_2.

So, the constraints require that during the plan, each of these conditions must be met at least once. Let's see how to satisfy each one while moving towards the goal.

First, the main goal is to be in front of a grey ball. The grey_ball_1 is in room_3. So, if I can just go to it, that's the simplest. But why can't I do that immediately? Because maybe the path is blocked or there are doors locked.

Wait, the initial state has all doors locked. All doors are locked: green_door_1, red_door_1, green_door_2, grey_door_1. So initially, all doors are locked. The agent starts in room_3. The doors connected to room_3 are red_door_1 (connecting to room_1) and grey_door_1 (connecting to room_4). But since all doors are locked, the agent can't move to another room unless they unlock a door.

But the problem is, the grey_ball_1 is already in room_3. So maybe the agent can just go to it. Let's check the preconditions for "gotoobject x r". The agent must be in the same room as x. Since the agent is in room_3 and grey_ball_1 is in room_3, they can perform "gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_3". Then, that's the final action. But wait, the constraints must be satisfied in the plan. So even if the main goal is achieved in one step, the constraints need to be checked.

Wait, but the constraints are that each of the seven conditions must hold in at least one state during the plan. So even if the main goal is achieved quickly, the plan must include actions that make those conditions true at some point.

So the challenge is to find a path that achieves the goal while also passing through all the required constraint states.

Let's list the constraints again and see how to satisfy each:

1. green_door_1 is not locked AND in front of green_ball_2. So, need to unlock green_door_1 and be in front of green_ball_2. green_ball_2 is in room_3. green_door_1 connects room_1 and room_2. So to unlock green_door_1, the agent must be in front of it. But green_door_1 is in room_1 or room_2. The agent starts in room_3. So the agent can't reach green_door_1 without first unlocking doors. Wait, but all doors are locked. So the agent is stuck in room_3 unless they can unlock a door.

Wait, the initial doors are all locked. The agent is in room_3. The doors from room_3 are red_door_1 (to room_1) and grey_door_1 (to room_4). Both are locked. So the agent can't leave room_3 unless they unlock one of these doors.

But to unlock a door, they need to be in front of it. So first, the agent needs to go to a door in room_3. The doors in room_3 are red_door_1 (connecting to room_1) and grey_door_1 (connecting to room_4). So in room_3, the agent can "gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1" but first check if the preconditions are met. The preconditions for "gotodoor d r1 r2" are: (i) the agent is in a room connected by door d, which they are (room_3 is connected to room_1 via red_door_1), and (ii) there is no object blocking the position in front of d in the current room. Are there any objects blocking the doors in room_3? The initial state lists objects in room_3 as grey_box_2, yellow_box_1, grey_ball_1, green_ball_2. The doors are in the room, but the problem states that "there are no objects blocking the position in front of d in the current room". Wait, the problem's initial state doesn't mention any objects blocking doors. So the agent can go to the door. So first, the agent can "gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1", then "toggle red_door_1" to unlock it, allowing them to go to room_1. But why would they need to do that? Let's see.

But the main goal is to be in front of grey_ball_1 in room_3. So perhaps the agent can just do "gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_3" immediately. But then, the constraints need to be checked. Let's check each constraint:

Constraint 7: At some state, the agent is in front of green_ball_2. Since green_ball_2 is in room_3, the agent could go there. So maybe the plan includes going to green_ball_2 first, then to grey_ball_1, satisfying constraint 7.

But other constraints need to be addressed. Let's go through each constraint:

1. green_door_1 is not locked and in front of green_ball_2. green_ball_2 is in room_3. green_door_1 is in room_1 and room_2. So the agent needs to unlock green_door_1, but that's in room_1 or room_2. The agent is in room_3. To get to green_door_1, the agent would need to go through red_door_1 (room_3 to room_1), then go to green_door_1 in room_1 or room_2, unlock it, and then return to room_3 to be in front of green_ball_2. But this seems complicated.

Alternatively, maybe the agent can unlock red_door_1, go to room_1, then go to room_2 via green_door_1 (which is locked), but that's not possible. Wait, maybe there's another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the agent can unlock grey_door_1 (which connects room_3 to room_4), go to room_4, then unlock green_door_2 (connects room_2 and room_4), but that requires moving through multiple rooms.

This is getting complicated. Let's try to outline steps that satisfy all constraints.

First, the main goal is to be in front of grey_ball_1 in room_3. The constraints require various things:

Constraint 4: Must be in room_4 with red_door_1 unlocked. So at some point, red_door_1 must be unlocked and agent is in room_4. But red_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3. To get to room_4, the agent needs to go through grey_door_1 from room_3. So first, unlock grey_door_1 in room_3, go to room_4. Then, red_door_1 is in room_1 and room_3. To unlock red_door_1, the agent would have to be in front of it. But to get to room_1, the agent would need to unlock red_door_1 from room_3. Wait, the agent is in room_3. If they unlock red_door_1 (which is in room_3 and room_1), then they can go to room_1. But how does constraint 4 come into play? Constraint 4 says that in some state, the agent is in room_4 AND red_door_1 is unlocked. So even if the agent unlocks red_door_1 in room_3, then later goes to room_4, that would satisfy the condition because red_door_1 is unlocked. So unlocking red_door_1, then going to room_4 via grey_door_1, which requires unlocking grey_door_1 first. But to unlock grey_door_1, the agent must be in front of it in room_3.

Let's outline steps:

1. Unlock red_door_1 and grey_door_1 in room_3.
   - But each toggle requires being in front of the door.
   So steps could be:
   a. goto red_door_1 in room_3.
   b. toggle to unlock it.
   c. goto grey_door_1 in room_3.
   d. toggle to unlock it.
   Then, agent can go to room_4 via grey_door_1.

But how does this help with constraint 4? Once red_door_1 is unlocked, and agent goes to room_4, then in room_4, the red_door_1 is still unlocked. So the state where agent is in room_4 and red_door_1 is unlocked would be satisfied after unlocking red_door_1 and then going to room_4.

So steps could be:

- goto red_door_1 in room_3 (gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1)
- toggle red_door_1 (unlocks it)
- goto grey_door_1 in room_3 (gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4)
- toggle grey_door_1 (unlocks it)
- goto room_4 from room_3 via grey_door_1 (gotoroom room_3 room_4 grey_door_1)
Now, in room_4. At this point, red_door_1 is unlocked (still), so constraint 4 is satisfied here.

But wait, after unlocking red_door_1, it remains unlocked unless toggled again. So when the agent is in room_4, red_door_1 is still unlocked. So constraint 4 is satisfied here.

So that takes care of constraint 4.

Now, constraint 6 requires either holding grey_box_2 or being in room_4. Since the agent is in room_4 now, that satisfies constraint 6 at this step.

Constraint 3 requires either green_door_2 is unlocked or in front of grey_box_2. green_door_2 connects room_2 and room_4. So if the agent is in room_4, they can go to green_door_2, unlock it. But green_door_2 is locked initially. Alternatively, if they are in front of grey_box_2 (which is in room_3), but that would require being in room_3. Alternatively, if they unlock green_door_2, which is in room_4 and room_2. So to unlock green_door_2, the agent needs to be in front of it in room_4. Then, unlocking it would satisfy the first part of constraint 3.

But the agent is in room_4. So maybe:

After entering room_4, go to green_door_2 (gotodoor green_door_2 room_4 room_2), then toggle to unlock it. That would satisfy constraint 3's first condition (green_door_2 is unlocked). But then, that's one step. However, the agent is in room_4, so to get to green_door_2 in room_4, they need to go there. But after arriving in room_4, they are not in front of any door. So:

From room_4, gotodoor green_door_2 room_4 room_2, then toggle green_door_2. This unlocks it, satisfying the first part of constraint 3.

Alternatively, maybe the agent can pick up grey_box_2 in room_3 before moving. Let's see.

Wait, constraint 2: at some state, either holding an object or grey_box_2 is in room_2. grey_box_2 is initially in room_3. To have it in room_2, the agent would need to carry it there. But the agent is in room_3, can pick up grey_box_2, then take it to room_2. But to get to room_2, the agent would need to go through room_1 (via red_door_1) and then room_1 to room_2 via green_door_1, which is locked. So that's a longer path. Alternatively, via room_4: room_3 to room_4 (unlock grey_door_1), then room_4 to room_2 via green_door_2 (which is locked). So that's not possible unless green_door_2 is unlocked. So maybe the agent needs to unlock green_door_2 as part of the plan.

But this is getting complicated. Let's try to outline a possible plan step by step, considering all constraints.

Starting in room_3.

1. goto grey_ball_1 in room_3. But wait, no. Because then the main goal is achieved, but none of the constraints are met. So the constraints need to be satisfied in the plan's steps.

So the plan must include actions that trigger each constraint at least once.

Let me list each constraint and think about how to satisfy them:

Constraint 1: green_door_1 unlocked and in front of green_ball_2. green_ball_2 is in room_3. So the agent must be in front of green_ball_2 (in room_3) and green_door_1 must be unlocked. To unlock green_door_1, which connects room_1 and room_2, the agent must go to it (in room_1 or room_2) and toggle it. But the agent starts in room_3. So they need to unlock red_door_1 (room_3 to room_1), go to room_1, then go to room_2 via green_door_1 (which is locked), but that's not possible. Wait, but after unlocking red_door_1, agent can go to room_1, but then green_door_1 is in room_1 and room_2. To unlock green_door_1, agent must be in front of it in room_1. Then toggle it. Then, return to room_3, go to green_ball_2. But how?

This seems like a long path, but maybe necessary. Let's outline:

- Unlock red_door_1 (room_3) to go to room_1.
- Go to room_1.
- Unlock green_door_1 (room_1) to go to room_2.
- Then, in room_2, maybe do something.
- Then return to room_3, go to green_ball_2, ensuring that green_door_1 is unlocked and agent is in front of green_ball_2 (constraint 1).

But this seems lengthy. Let's see if there's a shorter way.

Alternatively, maybe the agent can unlock green_door_1 from room_2. But to get to room_2, the agent needs to go through room_1 via red_door_1 (unlocked) then green_door_1 (locked). But since green_door_1 is locked, they can't enter room_2. So they can't unlock green_door_1 unless they are in room_2 or room_1. So the agent must first unlock red_door_1, go to room_1, then unlock green_door_1 in room_1, then go to room_2. But this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, maybe the agent can pick up green_ball_2 in room_3, carry it to another room, but that's not needed for the main goal. Wait, the main goal is to be in front of a grey ball, which is already in room_3. So perhaps the plan can be:

1. In room_3, go to grey_ball_1. But then the constraints are not met. So the plan must include other steps.

Alternatively, the agent must first satisfy the constraints before achieving the main goal.

Let's tackle the constraints one by one.

Constraint 7: be in front of green_ball_2. Since green_ball_2 is in room_3, the agent can go to it. So action: gotoobject green_ball_2 room_3. That satisfies constraint 7. But when they do this, they are in front of green_ball_2. Then, to satisfy constraint 1, green_door_1 must be unlocked at some point when they are in front of green_ball_2. Wait, but how can green_door_1 be unlocked while the agent is in front of green_ball_2 in room_3? Because green_door_1 is in room_1 and room_2. So unless the agent unlocks green_door_1 while being in front of green_ball_2, but that's not possible. So the agent would have to unlock green_door_1 in a previous step, then later be in front of green_ball_2 while green_door_1 is unlocked.

So steps could be:

- Unlock green_door_1 (requires going to room_1 or room_2 and toggling it).
- Then, in room_3, go to green_ball_2. At that moment, green_door_1 is unlocked, satisfying constraint 1.

But to unlock green_door_1, the agent must have gone to room_1 or room_2. Let's see:

Agent starts in room_3. To get to room_1, unlock red_door_1 (in room_3), then go to room_1. Then, in room_1, go to green_door_1 (which connects to room_2), toggle it to unlock. Then return to room_3 via red_door_1. Now, green_door_1 is unlocked. Then, in room_3, go to green_ball_2. At this step, green_door_1 is unlocked, and agent is in front of green_ball_2. That satisfies constraint 1.

This seems possible. Let's outline:

1. goto red_door_1 in room_3 (gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1)
2. toggle red_door_1 (unlocks it)
3. gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1 (move to room_1)
4. goto green_door_1 in room_1 (gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_2)
5. toggle green_door_1 (unlocks it)
6. gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1 (return to room_3)
7. gotoobject green_ball_2 room_3 (now, green_door_1 is unlocked and agent is in front of green_ball_2: satisfies constraint 1)

But this is a lot of steps. Also, need to check other constraints.

Constraint 2: either holding an object or grey_box_2 in room_2. Currently, grey_box_2 is in room_3. So to satisfy this, the agent could pick up grey_box_2 and hold it (satisfying "holding some object"), or move grey_box_2 to room_2. Moving it would require carrying it through rooms. But moving from room_3 to room_1 (via red_door_1), then to room_2 (via green_door_1, now unlocked), then drop it. But this adds steps.

Alternatively, the agent can pick up grey_box_2 in room_3, then drop it somewhere. But during the time they are holding it, that satisfies constraint 2.

For example, after step 7 (in front of green_ball_2), if the agent picks up green_ball_2, they are holding an object. So constraint 2 is satisfied. But the main goal is to be in front of grey_ball_1. So after picking up green_ball_2, they would need to drop it and then go to grey_ball_1. But this adds steps. Alternatively, maybe the agent can pick up grey_box_2 in room_3 before moving to other rooms.

Wait, let's think of steps:

If the agent picks up grey_box_2 in room_3, that satisfies constraint 2 (holding some object). Then they can proceed. But to pick up grey_box_2, they need to be in front of it. So:

In room_3:

1. gotoobject grey_box_2 room_3
2. pick grey_box_2 room_3 (now holding it, satisfying constraint 2)
3. drop it somewhere else, but not necessary. However, carrying it may block other actions. But the main goal is to be in front of grey_ball_1. So after picking up grey_box_2, they can drop it later.

But maybe this is a way to satisfy constraint 2 without moving it to room_2. So the agent can pick up grey_box_2, then drop it somewhere in room_3. But that would require two actions. Alternatively, if they hold it during some steps, that's sufficient.

But let's see: if in step 2, after picking up grey_box_2, the agent is holding it. Then during that time, constraint 2 is satisfied. So if they pick it up at some point, that's enough.

But maybe the plan can integrate this. For example:

After step 7 (in front of green_ball_2), the agent can pick up green_ball_2, then drop it, then go to grey_ball_1. But this may complicate things.

Alternatively, during the plan, the agent could pick up grey_box_2 in room_3, then carry it to room_4, drop it there. But that requires going to room_4.

Let me try to outline a plan that satisfies all constraints.

Possible steps:

1. gotoobject grey_box_2 room_3
2. pick grey_box_2 room_3 (now holding it, satisfies constraint 2)
3. drop grey_box_2 room_3 (but why? Maybe not necessary)
4. gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1
5. toggle red_door_1 (unlock)
6. gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1 (now in room_1)
7. gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_2
8. toggle green_door_1 (unlock)
9. gotoroom room_1 room_2 green_door_1 (now in room_2)
10. gotoobject green_ball_1 room_2 (satisfies constraint 5: in front of green_ball_1)
11. gotodoor green_door_2 room_2 room_4
12. toggle green_door_2 (unlock)
13. gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_2 (now in room_4, satisfies constraint 6)
14. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3
15. toggle grey_door_1 (unlock)
16. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1 (back to room_3)
17. gotoobject green_ball_2 room_3 (satisfies constraint 7)
18. toggle red_door_1 (lock again? Not needed, but perhaps need to have red_door_1 unlocked when in room_4)
Wait, no. Constraint 4 requires being in room_4 with red_door_1 unlocked. After step 13, agent is in room_4, and red_door_1 was unlocked in step 5. So constraint 4 is satisfied during step 13.

But wait, red_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3. So when the agent is in room_4, red_door_1 is in room_1 and room_3. But the state of red_door_1 is unlocked. So in room_4, the agent is in room_4 and red_door_1 is unlocked. That's the condition for constraint 4. So step 13 satisfies constraint 4.

Then, after returning to room_3, the agent can go to green_ball_2 (step 17), which satisfies constraint 7. Also, in step 17, if green_door_1 is unlocked (from step 8), then constraint 1 is satisfied (green_door_1 is unlocked and agent is in front of green_ball_2). Yes, because step 8 unlocks green_door_1, and step 17 is after that. So constraint 1 is satisfied at step 17.

Constraint 3 requires that green_door_2 is unlocked or in front of grey_box_2. Step 12 unlocks green_door_2, so that satisfies the first part. So during step 12, after toggle, green_door_2 is unlocked, satisfying constraint 3.

Constraint 5: either yellow_ball_1 is in room_3 (which it already is) or in front of green_ball_1. In step 10, the agent is in front of green_ball_1, so that satisfies constraint 5.

Constraint 6: either holding grey_box_2 or in room_4. During step 2-3, the agent is holding grey_box_2, satisfying constraint 2. During step 13, the agent is in room_4, satisfying constraint 6.

Now, after step 17, the agent is in front of green_ball_2. Then, need to go to grey_ball_1. So:

19. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_3 (achieves the goal)

But wait, after step 17, the agent is in front of green_ball_2. To go to grey_ball_1, they need to go to it. So:

19. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_3

This would be the final step.

But let's check if all constraints are met:

1. Constraint 1: green_door_1 unlocked (step 8) and in front of green_ball_2 (step 17). Yes.
2. Constraint 2: holding grey_box_2 (step 2-3) or grey_box_2 in room_2 (no). So step 2 satisfies it.
3. Constraint 3: green_door_2 unlocked (step 12). Yes.
4. Constraint 4: in room_4 (step 13) with red_door_1 unlocked. Yes.
5. Constraint 5: in front of green_ball_1 (step 10). Yes.
6. Constraint 6: in room_4 (step 13). Yes.
7. Constraint 7: in front of green_ball_2 (step 17). Yes.

All constraints are satisfied. Now, the plan is:

1. gotoobject grey_box_2 room_3
2. pick grey_box_2 room_3
3. drop grey_box_2 room_3 (but why? To free hands? Or maybe not needed. Wait, after picking it up, to satisfy constraint 2, it's enough to hold it once. Then, the agent can carry it, but they might need to drop it later to perform other actions like toggling doors. But in the steps I outlined earlier, after step 2, the agent is holding grey_box_2. Then, to go to red_door_1, they need to be in front of it. But the "gotoobject" requires being in the same room, which they are. But "gotodoor" requires that there's no object blocking the door. Assuming that carrying grey_box_2 doesn't block the door. So the agent can carry grey_box_2 while moving. However, to perform "gotodoor", they need to not be holding anything? No, the preconditions for "gotodoor" don't mention holding objects. So the agent can be holding an object and still go to a door. The only issue is when they want to "toggle" a door, which requires being in front of it. They can do that while holding an object. So maybe the agent doesn't need to drop grey_box_2. So steps could be:

1. gotoobject grey_box_2 room_3
2. pick grey_box_2 room_3 (now holding it)
3. gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1
4. toggle red_door_1 (unlock)
5. gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1 (now in room_1)
6. gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_2
7. toggle green_door_1 (unlock)
8. gotoroom room_1 room_2 green_door_1 (now in room_2)
9. gotoobject green_ball_1 room_2 (satisfies constraint 5)
10. gotodoor green_door_2 room_2 room_4
11. toggle green_door_2 (unlock)
12. gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_2 (now in room_4, satisfies constraint 4 and 6)
13. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3
14. toggle grey_door_1 (unlock)
15. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1 (back to room_3)
16. gotoobject green_ball_2 room_3 (satisfies constraint 7 and 1 if green_door_1 is unlocked)
17. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_3 (achieve goal)

But in this plan, the agent is holding grey_box_2 from step 2 onward. So when they perform "toggle" actions (steps 4,7,11,14), they are holding the box, but the preconditions for "toggle" only require being in front of the door, which they are. So this is allowed.

However, when the agent is holding an object, they cannot pick up another. But since they only need to pick up grey_box_2 once, this is okay.

But the problem is that when they drop the box, but in this plan, they don't drop it. They keep holding it until the end. But dropping is not necessary unless required by other actions. However, the final goal is to be in front of grey_ball_1. So if the agent is holding grey_box_2, can they still drop it before going to grey_ball_1? Because the "drop" action requires being in front of an empty position. So after step 16 (in front of green_ball_2), they can "gotoempty" to an empty spot, then drop grey_box_2, then goto grey_ball_1.

But perhaps it's easier to drop the box earlier. Let's see:

After step 2, the agent is holding grey_box_2. Then, after unlocking red_door_1 and moving to room_1, maybe drop it there. But why? To free hands for other actions. But in this plan, the agent doesn't need to pick up anything else, so holding it is fine. The only issue is when they need to drop it to meet the goal. The goal requires being in front of a grey ball, not holding anything. So the agent can be holding the box when achieving the goal. Wait, no. The goal is just that there exists a ball v (grey) that the agent is in front of. It doesn't specify that the agent isn't holding anything. So even if the agent is holding the box, as long as they are in front of grey_ball_1, the goal is achieved. So dropping the box is not necessary.

But wait, the initial state says "you are not holding any object". The goal doesn't require the agent to not be holding anything. So the final state can have the agent holding grey_box_2 while in front of grey_ball_1. That's acceptable. So the plan can end with the agent holding grey_box_2.

However, the "drop" action is only needed if required by constraints. In this case, the constraints are already satisfied.

But wait, constraint 2 requires that in at least one state, the agent is holding some object OR grey_box_2 is in room_2. In this plan, the agent is holding grey_box_2 from step 2 onwards, so constraint 2 is satisfied throughout. That's okay.

But the plan outlined above includes holding grey_box_2 the entire time. Is that allowed? Let's check the preconditions for other actions. For example, "gotoroom" requires that the door is unlocked. The agent is holding an object, but that doesn't affect moving through doors. So yes, this is allowed.

But in the step where the agent is in room_2 and goes to green_door_2 (step 10-11), they are holding grey_box_2, but that's okay.

So the plan would be:

1. gotoobject grey_box_2 room_3
2. pick grey_box_2 room_3
3. gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1
4. toggle red_door_1
5. gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1
6. gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_2
7. toggle green_door_1
8. gotoroom room_1 room_2 green_door_1
9. gotoobject green_ball_1 room_2
10. gotodoor green_door_2 room_2 room_4
11. toggle green_door_2
12. gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_2
13. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3
14. toggle grey_door_1
15. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1
16. gotoobject green_ball_2 room_3
17. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_3

Now, checking constraints:

1. After step 7, green_door_1 is unlocked. Step 16 is in front of green_ball_2. So at step 16, green_door_1 is unlocked and agent is in front of green_ball_2. Satisfies constraint 1.
2. Agent is holding grey_box_2 from step 2 onwards. Satisfies constraint 2.
3. After step 11, green_door_2 is unlocked. Satisfies constraint 3.
4. Step 12: in room_4, red_door_1 was unlocked in step 4. Satisfies constraint 4.
5. Step 9: in front of green_ball_1. Satisfies constraint 5.
6. Step 12: in room_4. Satisfies constraint 6.
7. Step 16: in front of green_ball_2. Satisfies constraint 7.

This plan seems to satisfy all constraints and achieve the goal. But is it optimal? The length is 17 actions. Maybe there's a shorter way.

Wait, perhaps some steps can be optimized. For example, after step 15, the agent is back in room_3. They need to go to green_ball_2 (step 16) and then to grey_ball_1 (step 17). But maybe they can go directly to grey_ball_1 after step 15. But then, constraint 7 requires being in front of green_ball_2. So step 16 is necessary.

Alternatively, can the agent go to green_ball_2 first, then grey_ball_1, combining some steps?

Wait, after step 15, the agent is in room_3. They can go to green_ball_2 (step 16), which is in room_3, then go to grey_ball_1 (step 17). That's two steps. Necessary.

Alternatively, is there a way to visit green_ball_2 earlier in the plan, thus satisfying constraint 7 earlier and avoiding some steps?

For example, after unlocking red_door_1 and grey_door_1 in room_3, go to green_ball_2 before moving to other rooms. Let's try:

Alternative plan:

1. gotoobject green_ball_2 room_3 (satisfies constraint 7)
2. gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1
3. toggle red_door_1 (unlocks it)
4. gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1
5. gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_2
6. toggle green_door_1 (unlocks it)
7. gotoroom room_1 room_2 green_door_1
8. gotoobject green_ball_1 room_2 (satisfies constraint 5)
9. gotodoor green_door_2 room_2 room_4
10. toggle green_door_2 (unlocks it)
11. gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_2 (satisfies constraint 4 and 6)
12. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3
13. toggle grey_door_1 (unlocks it)
14. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1
15. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_3 (achieves goal)

But in this plan:

Constraint 1: green_door_1 unlocked and in front of green_ball_2. At step 1, agent is in front of green_ball_2, but green_door_1 is still locked. After step 6, green_door_1 is unlocked. But after step 14, agent is back in room_3. So to satisfy constraint 1, after step 6, green_door_1 is unlocked, but agent is in room_2. They need to return to room_3 and be in front of green_ball_2 again. But in this plan, after step 14, agent is in room_3. So they can go to green_ball_2 again:

15. gotoobject green_ball_2 room_3 (now, green_door_1 is unlocked. So constraint 1 is satisfied here)
16. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_3

But this adds two more steps. So the plan becomes longer. So the initial plan is better.

Alternatively, can the agent satisfy constraint 1 by being in front of green_ball_2 after green_door_1 is unlocked, even if it's later in the plan.

In the alternative plan, after step 14 (room_3), green_door_1 is unlocked. So agent can go to green_ball_2 (step 15) which satisfies constraint 1. Then go to grey_ball_1 (step 16). This would work, making the plan length 16 steps, but requires additional steps.

But the initial plan (17 steps) seems longer. So perhaps there's a way to optimize.

Wait, perhaps the agent doesn't need to go to room_4 twice. Let's see:

Original plan after step 12 (room_4), then steps 13-15 return to room_3. But maybe after step 12 (room_4), the agent can go to grey_door_1 in room_4, unlock it, then go back to room_3, then proceed to green_ball_2 and grey_ball_1.

Alternatively, perhaps the agent can avoid going to room_4 and back, but that's necessary to satisfy constraint 4.

Alternatively, think of a different order.

Another approach: Since the agent needs to be in room_4 at least once (constraint 4 and 6), they must go there. Also, constraint 3 requires green_door_2 unlocked or in front of grey_box_2. So unlocking green_door_2 is one way.

But perhaps the agent can unlock grey_door_1 first, go to room_4, unlock green_door_2 there, then return. But grey_door_1 is initially locked. So steps:

1. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4
2. toggle grey_door_1 (unlock)
3. gotoroom room_3 room_4 grey_door_1 (now in room_4)
4. gotodoor green_door_2 room_4 room_2
5. toggle green_door_2 (unlock)
6. gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_2 (now in room_2)
7. gotoobject green_ball_1 room_2 (satisfies constraint 5)
8. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_1
9. toggle green_door_1 (unlock)
10. gotoroom room_2 room_1 green_door_1
11. gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3
12. toggle red_door_1 (unlock)
13. gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1 (back to room_3)
14. gotoobject green_ball_2 room_3 (satisfies constraint 7 and 1 if green_door_1 is unlocked)
15. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_3 (achieve goal)

But in this plan:

Constraint 4: must be in room_4 with red_door_1 unlocked. In this plan, after step 3, agent is in room_4. When is red_door_1 unlocked? In step 12. So after step 12, red_door_1 is unlocked. But the agent is in room_1, then room_3. So to satisfy constraint 4, the agent must be in room_4 and red_door_1 is unlocked. But in this plan, after step 12, red_door_1 is unlocked, but the agent is in room_3. So constraint 4 is not satisfied.

Thus, this plan doesn't satisfy constraint 4.

Therefore, the earlier plan is better.

Another idea: combine the unlocking of doors in a way that allows shorter paths.

But I think the initial plan is the way to go. However, maybe there's a shorter path.

Wait, the agent starts in room_3. They need to unlock red_door_1 and grey_door_1 to move to other rooms. Also, green_door_1 and green_door_2 need to be unlocked for certain constraints.

But perhaps the agent can go to room_4 via grey_door_1 first, unlock it, then go to room_4, unlock green_door_2, then go to room_2, then room_1, etc. Let's try:

1. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4
2. toggle grey_door_1 (unlock)
3. gotoroom room_3 room_4 grey_door_1 (room_4)
4. gotodoor green_door_2 room_4 room_2
5. toggle green_door_2 (unlock)
6. gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_2 (room_2)
7. gotoobject green_ball_1 room_2 (satisfies constraint 5)
8. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_1
9. toggle green_door_1 (unlock)
10. gotoroom room_2 room_1 green_door_1 (room_1)
11. gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3
12. toggle red_door_1 (unlock)
13. gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1 (room_3)
14. gotoobject green_ball_2 room_3 (satisfies constraint 7 and 1 if green_door_1 is unlocked)
15. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_3 (achieve goal)

In this plan:

Constraint 4: must be in room_4 and red_door_1 unlocked. After step 3, agent is in room_4. But red_door_1 is still locked (unlocked in step 12). So when agent is in room_4 (step 3), red_door_1 is locked. Thus, constraint 4 is not satisfied. So this plan is invalid.

Thus, the earlier plan where agent unlocks red_door_1 before going to room_4 is necessary.

Going back to the first plan:

The steps are necessary to satisfy all constraints. So the plan length is 17 actions. But perhaps there's a way to optimize.

Wait, after step 12 (in room_4), the agent can satisfy constraint 6 (being in room_4), and constraint 4 (red_door_1 is unlocked, agent is in room_4). So steps 12 and 13 in the initial plan.

Wait, perhaps after unlocking red_door_1 (step 4), the agent can proceed to unlock grey_door_1, go to room_4, then return, and then proceed to other rooms.

Alternative plan:

1. gotoobject grey_box_2 room_3
2. pick grey_box_2 room_3
3. gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1
4. toggle red_door_1 (unlock)
5. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4
6. toggle grey_door_1 (unlock)
7. gotoroom room_3 room_4 grey_door_1 (now in room_4)
   - Satisfies constraint 4 (in room_4, red_door_1 is unlocked)
   - Satisfies constraint 6 (in room_4)
8. gotodoor green_door_2 room_4 room_2
9. toggle green_door_2 (unlock)
10. gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_2 (room_2)
11. gotoobject green_ball_1 room_2 (constraint 5)
12. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_1
13. toggle green_door_1 (unlock)
14. gotoroom room_2 room_1 green_door_1 (room_1)
15. gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1 (room_3)
16. gotoobject green_ball_2 room_3 (constraint 7 and 1)
17. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_3

This plan has 17 steps. Let's check constraints:

1. green_door_1 is unlocked (step 13), and agent is in front of green_ball_2 (step 16). Yes.
2. Holding grey_box_2 (step 2 onwards). Yes.
3. green_door_2 unlocked (step 9). Yes.
4. In room_4 (step 7), red_door_1 unlocked (step 4). Yes.
5. In front of green_ball_1 (step 11). Yes.
6. In room_4 (step 7). Yes.
7. In front of green_ball_2 (step 16). Yes.

This plan also satisfies all constraints. But is it shorter? No, same number of steps.

But perhaps some steps can be optimized. For example, after step 7, the agent is in room_4. Then, they go to green_door_2, unlock it, and go to room_2. Then proceed to room_1, unlock green_door_1, and return to room_3.

But this seems necessary. So the plan length is 17 actions.

But the problem asks for an optimal plan, i.e., the shortest possible. Is there a shorter way?

Alternative approach: The agent can go to room_4 via grey_door_1 after unlocking it, satisfy constraints 4 and 6 there, then return to room_3, and proceed to unlock other doors.

But to satisfy constraint 1 (green_door_1 unlocked and in front of green_ball_2), the agent must unlock green_door_1 and then be in front of green_ball_2.

But to unlock green_door_1, the agent must go to room_1 or room_2. Which requires unlocking red_door_1 first.

So the steps are necessary.

Another idea: After unlocking red_door_1 and grey_door_1, the agent can go to room_1 and room_4. Then, in room_1, unlock green_door_1. Then, go to room_2 via green_door_1, unlock green_door_2, go to room_4, then return to room_3.

But this still requires multiple steps.

Is there a way to avoid going to room_2? Let's see.

Constraint 5 requires being in front of green_ball_1 or having yellow_ball_1 in room_3. yellow_ball_1 is initially in room_1. So if the agent can move yellow_ball_1 to room_3, that would satisfy constraint 5. But that requires picking it up and carrying it to room_3. But the agent is in room_3 initially. To get yellow_ball_1 from room_1, the agent needs to unlock red_door_1, go to room_1, pick it up, and bring it back.

So steps:

1. Unlock red_door_1 (steps as before)
2. Go to room_1, pick up yellow_ball_1
3. Return to room_3, drop it.

This would satisfy constraint 5 (yellow_ball_1 in room_3), but requires additional steps. However, this might be shorter than going to room_2 and in front of green_ball_1.

So let's try this approach:

Plan:

1. gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1
2. toggle red_door_1 (unlock)
3. gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1 (room_1)
4. gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_1
5. pick yellow_ball_1 room_1
6. gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3
7. gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1 (room_3)
8. drop yellow_ball_1 room_3 (now yellow_ball_1 is in room_3, satisfying constraint 5)
9. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4
10. toggle grey_door_1 (unlock)
11. gotoroom room_3 room_4 grey_door_1 (room_4, satisfies constraint 4 and 6)
12. gotodoor green_door_2 room_4 room_2
13. toggle green_door_2 (unlock)
14. gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_2 (room_2)
15. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_1
16. toggle green_door_1 (unlock)
17. gotoroom room_2 room_1 green_door_1 (room_1)
18. gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1 (room_3)
19. gotoobject green_ball_2 room_3 (satisfies constraint 7 and 1 if green_door_1 is unlocked)
20. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_3

But this plan is longer (20 steps). So it's worse. So the initial approach of going to room_2 and in front of green_ball_1 is better.

Thus, the initial plan seems to be the optimal one.

After thorough consideration, the initial plan with 17 steps seems necessary to meet all constraints. However, let's verify if all actions are necessary.

Wait, in the initial plan, after step 2, the agent picks up grey_box_2. But perhaps this step can be omitted if the agent can satisfy constraint 2 by moving grey_box_2 to room_2. But that would require carrying it to room_2, which involves more steps. So picking it up and holding it is more efficient.

Another optimization: after step 12 (room_4), the agent needs to unlock grey_door_1 again? No, in step 14, they unlock grey_door_1 in room_4. But in the initial plan, the agent returns to room_3 via grey_door_1, which was unlocked in step 14. But actually, after unlocking grey_door_1 in room_3, the agent can go to room_4 and back without needing to unlock it again. Wait, no. The initial state has grey_door_1 locked. So to go from room_3 to room_4 via grey_door_1, the agent must unlock it in room_3. Then, to return from room_4 to room_3, they need to unlock it again in room_4? No. Once unlocked, a door remains unlocked until toggled again. So if the agent unlocks grey_door_1 in room_3, then goes to room_4, they can return via grey_door_1 without toggling it again. But wait, the "toggle" action toggles the door's state. So unlocking it once makes it unlocked, and toggling again would lock it. But the agent only needs to unlock it once.

Wait, the initial plan steps:

1. gotoobject grey_box_2 room_3
2. pick grey_box_2 room_3
3. gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1
4. toggle red_door_1 (now unlocked)
5. gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1 (room_1)
6. gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_2
7. toggle green_door_1 (unlocked)
8. gotoroom room_1 room_2 green_door_1 (room_2)
9. gotoobject green_ball_1 room_2 (satisfies constraint 5)
10. gotodoor green_door_2 room_2 room_4
11. toggle green_door_2 (unlocked)
12. gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_2 (room_4)
13. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3
14. toggle grey_door_1 (now unlocked)
15. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1 (room_3)
16. gotoobject green_ball_2 room_3 (satisfies constraints 1 and 7)
17. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_3

Wait, step 14 toggles grey_door_1 in room_4. Initially, grey_door_1 was locked. After step 14, it's unlocked. But when the agent leaves room_3 to go to room_4 via grey_door_1, they must unlock it in room_3 first. But in this plan, the agent hasn't unlocked grey_door_1 in room_3. Oh, this is a mistake. Because the agent starts in room_3, and grey_door_1 is locked. So to go to room_4, they need to unlock grey_door_1 in room_3. But in the initial plan steps above, the agent goes to room_4 via grey_door_1 in step 12, which would require unlocking grey_door_1 first. But in the current steps, the agent hasn't unlocked grey_door_1 in room_3. So this is an error.

This means that the initial plan is invalid because the agent cannot go to room_4 via grey_door_1 unless they unlock it first. So the initial plan has a mistake.

This changes everything. So the agent cannot go from room_2 to room_4 via green_door_2 unless green_door_2 is unlocked. But in the initial plan, step 11 unlocks green_door_2 in room_2. So agent can go to room_4 via green_door_2. But to return to room_3 from room_4, the agent needs to use grey_door_1, which is locked. So they need to unlock grey_door_1 in room_4.

But grey_door_1 connects room_3 and room_4. So in room_4, the agent can go to grey_door_1, toggle it (unlock), then go to room_3.

So in the initial plan:

After step 12 (in room_4), the agent needs to unlock grey_door_1 in room_4 to return to room_3. So steps 13 and 14 are:

13. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3
14. toggle grey_door_1 (unlocks it)
15. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1 (room_3)

Then proceed to step 16 and 17.

But in this case, grey_door_1 is now unlocked. So when the agent is in room_3, grey_door_1 is unlocked. But in the initial state, grey_door_1 was locked. So after step 14, grey_door_1 is unlocked, allowing movement between room_3 and room_4.

But this corrects the initial mistake. So the initial plan is still valid, but with the necessary step of unlocking grey_door_1 in room_4.

So the correct plan steps are:

1. gotoobject grey_box_2 room_3
2. pick grey_box_2 room_3
3. gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1
4. toggle red_door_1
5. gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1 (room_1)
6. gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_2
7. toggle green_door_1
8. gotoroom room_1 room_2 green_door_1 (room_2)
9. gotoobject green_ball_1 room_2
10. gotodoor green_door_2 room_2 room_4
11. toggle green_door_2
12. gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_2 (room_4)
13. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3
14. toggle grey_door_1
15. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1 (room_3)
16. gotoobject green_ball_2 room_3
17. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_3

This plan correctly unlocks grey_door_1 in room_4 (step 14), allowing the agent to return to room_3.

Now, all constraints are satisfied as before. The plan has 17 steps. However, I need to check if any steps can be removed.

For example, after step 12 (room_4), the agent can go to grey_door_1, unlock it, and return to room_3. This is necessary.

Another optimization: After step 15, the agent is back in room_3. They need to go to green_ball_2 and then grey_ball_1. These are two separate steps, but necessary.

Is there a way to combine these? No, because they are two different objects. So each requires a separate "gotoobject" action.

Thus, the plan is optimal with 17 steps. But perhaps there's a shorter way by not carrying grey_box_2.

Alternative plan without picking up grey_box_2:

To satisfy constraint 2, either hold an object or move grey_box_2 to room_2. If the agent moves grey_box_2 to room_2, that would require:

1. gotoobject grey_box_2 room_3
2. pick grey_box_2 room_3
3. gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1
4. toggle red_door_1
5. gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1
6. gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_2
7. toggle green_door_1
8. gotoroom room_1 room_2 green_door_1
9. drop grey_box_2 room_2 (now grey_box_2 is in room_2, satisfying constraint 2)
10. proceed to other steps.

But this adds steps, making the plan longer. So it's better to carry grey_box_2 and satisfy constraint 2 by holding it.

Therefore, the initial plan with 17 steps is optimal.
