Okay, let's try to figure out how to solve this planning problem. The goal is to have a purple box (v) in room_1, with me in room_1 and in front of that box. The initial state is that I'm in room_2, and there's a purple_box_1 already in room_1. So the box is already in the right place. But I need to get to room_1 and be in front of it. However, all doors are locked initially, so I need to unlock them somehow.

First, the doors: room_2 is connected to room_1 via red_door_1, which is locked. To get to room_1 from room_2, I need to go through red_door_1, but it's locked. So I need to unlock it. To toggle a door, I have to be in front of it. So I need to go to red_door_1 in room_2, then toggle it to unlock. Then I can go from room_2 to room_1 via red_door_1. Once in room_1, I can go to the purple_box_1 and be in front of it.

Wait, but the initial state says the purple_box_1 is in room_1. So the box is already there. So the steps would be: unlock red_door_1, go through it to room_1, then gotoobject purple_box_1 in room_1. That should satisfy the goal. Let me check the constraints.

Constraints: The problem says there are constraints, but the user hasn't listed any specific ones beyond the general action preconditions. So assuming the main constraints are the door locks and needing to be in front of doors to toggle them.

So starting in room_2. Doors are all locked. So first, go to red_door_1 in room_2. But to goto the door, I need to make sure there's no object blocking the position in front of it in my current room (room_2). The initial state doesn't mention any objects in room_2 except the ones listed. The objects in room_2 initially are none except me. So the red_door_1's front position in room_2 is not blocked. So I can do gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_1. Then toggle red_door_1 to unlock. Then gotoroom room_2 room_1 red_door_1. Then gotoobject purple_box_1 room_1. That should do it.

Wait, but after toggling the door, it becomes unlocked. Then I can go through. Then in room_1, I can goto the purple_box_1. Let me verify each step's preconditions.

First action: gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_1. Preconditions: I'm in a room connected by the door (room_2 is connected via red_door_1 to room_1, so yes). And there's no object blocking the position in front of the door in room_2. Since the initial state doesn't mention any objects in room_2, this is okay. So that's allowed. Then I'm in front of red_door_1.

Next action: toggle red_door_1. Precondition: must be in front of it. Yes. Toggling it will unlock it since it was locked.

Then, gotoroom room_2 room_1 red_door_1. Preconditions: I'm in room_2 (yes), the door connects room_2 and room_1 (yes), and the door is unlocked (now yes after toggle). So that's allowed. Then I move to room_1, and I'm no longer in front of anything.

Now, in room_1, I need to gotoobject purple_box_1. The precondition is that I'm in the same room as the object. Since purple_box_1 is in room_1, and I'm now in room_1, that's allowed. So do gotoobject purple_box_1 room_1. Then I'm in front of it. That meets the goal: purple_box_1 is purple, in room_1, I'm in room_1, and in front of it.

So the plan would be:

gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_1
toggle red_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_1 red_door_1
gotoobject purple_box_1 room_1

That's four actions. Is there a shorter plan? Let's see. The initial doors are all locked. To get from room_2 to room_1, the red_door_1 is the only direct connection. So I must unlock it first. So these steps are necessary. There's no way around unlocking the door, moving through it, then going to the box. So this should be the optimal plan with four steps.
