Alright, I'll analyze this planning problem step by step.

First, let's understand what our goal state is:
- We need to be in room_1, in front of a purple box (purple_box_1), which should also be in room_1.

Initial state:
- We start in room_2.
- All doors (red_door_1, grey_door_1, yellow_door_1, purple_door_1) are locked.
- Various objects are in different rooms, including purple_box_1 being in room_1.
- We are not holding any object.

Constraints:
1. At some point, we must be holding an object.
2. At some point, yellow_door_1 must be unlocked.
3. In every state, red_door_1 must remain locked.
4. At some point, we must be in room_2.
5. If we are in room_2, then at that state or some later state, we must be holding yellow_ball_2 and grey_box_1 must be in room_2.
6. At some point, purple_door_1 must be unlocked.
7. At some point, yellow_ball_1 must be in room_1.

Let's think about the problem. 

The goal is to be in room_1, in front of purple_box_1. However, we start in room_2 and need to reach room_1. The door between room_2 and room_1 is red_door_1, which must remain locked according to the constraints. This means we cannot use the direct route from room_2 to room_1.

Instead, we need to find another path, probably through room_3 or room_4.

Room connections:
- room_1 and room_2 are connected via red_door_1.
- room_1 and room_3 are connected via grey_door_1.
- room_2 and room_4 are connected via yellow_door_1.
- room_3 and room_4 are connected via purple_door_1.

Given these constraints, a possible path from room_2 to room_1 could be:
room_2 -> room_4 -> room_3 -> room_1

But we need to satisfy all the constraints along the way.

Let's sketch out a plan:

1. Satisfy the constraint "If you are in room_2, then you need to be holding yellow_ball_2 and grey_box_1 must be in room_2".
   - yellow_ball_2 is in room_3, and grey_box_1 is also in room_3. We need to move them.
   - First, we need to unlock the doors to get to room_3.

2. Satisfy the constraint "At some point, yellow_door_1 must be unlocked".
   - We need to go to yellow_door_1 and toggle it.

3. Satisfy the constraint "At some point, purple_door_1 must be unlocked".
   - We need to go to purple_door_1 and toggle it.

4. Satisfy the constraint "At some point, yellow_ball_1 must be in room_1".
   - yellow_ball_1 is in room_3, and we need to move it to room_1.

5. Satisfy the constraint "At some point, we must be holding an object".
   - This will be fulfilled during our plan.

6. Ensure that "red_door_1 is locked" in every state.
   - We should avoid toggling red_door_1.

7. Finally, achieve the goal: "Be in room_1, in front of purple_box_1, which should also be in room_1".

Now, let's trace out a plan step by step:

We are in room_2:
1. Go to the door yellow_door_1.
2. Toggle yellow_door_1 to unlock it.
3. Go to room_4 using yellow_door_1.

From room_4:
4. Go to the door purple_door_1.
5. Toggle purple_door_1 to unlock it.
6. Go to room_3 using purple_door_1.

From room_3:
7. Go to grey_box_1.
8. Pick up grey_box_1.
9. Go to door grey_door_1.
10. While holding grey_box_1, toggle grey_door_1 to unlock it.
11. Go to room_1 using grey_door_1.
12. Goto empty to drop grey_box_1 in front of an empty position.
13. Drop grey_box_1.
14. Go back to room_3 using grey_door_1.
15. Go to yellow_ball_1.
16. Pick up yellow_ball_1.
17. Go to door grey_door_1.
18. Go to room_1 using grey_door_1.
19. Goto empty.
20. Drop yellow_ball_1. (This satisfies the constraint "At some point, yellow_ball_1 must be in room_1".)
21. Go back to room_3 using grey_door_1.
22. Go to yellow_ball_2.
23. Pick up yellow_ball_2.
24. Go to door grey_door_1.
25. Go to room_1 using grey_door_1.
26. Go to door red_door_1.
27. Go to room_2 using red_door_1. (This is a mistake, as red_door_1 is locked and must remain so.)

Actually, there's a mistake in my last steps. We cannot use red_door_1, as it's locked and must remain so. I need to rethink this.

Since we need to be in room_2 at some point and hold yellow_ball_2 while grey_box_1 is in room_2, and since we can't use red_door_1, we need to get back to room_2 via room_4:
room_1 -> room_3 -> room_4 -> room_2

So, let's revise the plan:

From room_1:
26. Go back to room_3 using grey_door_1.
27. Go to door purple_door_1.
28. Go to room_4 using purple_door_1.
29. Go to door yellow_door_1.
30. Go to room_2 using yellow_door_1.

Now we are in room_2, holding yellow_ball_2. But we need grey_box_1 to be in room_2 as well. We left grey_box_1 in room_1. Let's revise:

First, let's fix a mistake: we should not have dropped grey_box_1 in room_1; we should have kept it and taken it to room_2.

But now, we need to rethink the order of operations to ensure all constraints are met.

Let's restart our plan:

We are in room_2:
1. Go to the door yellow_door_1.
2. Toggle yellow_door_1 to unlock it.
3. Go to room_4 using yellow_door_1.

From room_4:
4. Go to the door purple_door_1.
5. Toggle purple_door_1 to unlock it.
6. Go to room_3 using purple_door_1.

From room_3:
7. Go to grey_door_1.
8. Toggle grey_door_1 to unlock it.
9. Go to yellow_ball_2.
10. Pick up yellow_ball_2.
11. Go to door grey_door_1.
12. Go to room_1 using grey_door_1.
13. Goto empty.
14. Drop yellow_ball_2.
15. Go back to room_3 using grey_door_1.
16. Go to yellow_ball_1.
17. Pick up yellow_ball_1.
18. Go to door grey_door_1.
19. Go to room_1 using grey_door_1.
20. Goto empty.
21. Drop yellow_ball_1. (This satisfies the constraint "At some point, yellow_ball_1 must be in room_1".)
22. Go back to room_3 using grey_door_1.
23. Go to grey_box_1.
24. Pick up grey_box_1.
25. Go to door purple_door_1.
26. Go to room_4 using purple_door_1.
27. Go to door yellow_door_1.
28. Go to room_2 using yellow_door_1.
29. Goto empty.
30. Drop grey_box_1. (Now grey_box_1 is in room_2.)
31. Go to yellow_ball_2 (which is in room_1).

Wait, that's not right. I need to be more careful with the room layouts.

Let's restart the plan with a clearer understanding of where things are.

We are in room_2, and we need to get to room_1. The direct path is via red_door_1, but that door must remain locked. So, we need to go:
room_2 -> room_4 -> room_3 -> room_1

We also need to satisfy the constraint: "If you are in room_2, then at that state or a later state, you must be holding yellow_ball_2 and grey_box_1 must be in room_2."

Let's trace out the plan again:

We are in room_2:
1. Go to the door yellow_door_1.
2. Toggle yellow_door_1 to unlock it.
3. Go to room_4 using yellow_door_1.

From room_4:
4. Go to the door purple_door_1.
5. Toggle purple_door_1 to unlock it.
6. Go to room_3 using purple_door_1.

From room_3:
7. Go to grey_box_1.
8. Pick up grey_box_1.
9. Go to door purple_door_1.
10. Go to room_4 using purple_door_1.
11. Go to door yellow_door_1.
12. Go to room_2 using yellow_door_1.
13. Goto empty.
14. Drop grey_box_1. (Now grey_box_1 is in room_2.)
15. Go to door yellow_door_1.
16. Go to room_4 using yellow_door_1.
17. Go to door purple_door_1.
18. Go to room_3 using purple_door_1.
19. Go to yellow_ball_2.
20. Pick up yellow_ball_2.
21. Go to door purple_door_1.
22. Go to room_4 using purple_door_1.
23. Go to door yellow_door_1.
24. Go to room_2 using yellow_door_1. (Now we are in room_2, holding yellow_ball_2, and grey_box_1 is also in room_2.)
25. Now, we need to head to room_1. But we can't go directly via red_door_1 since it must remain locked. We need to go via room_4 and room_3.
26. Go to door yellow_door_1.
27. Go to room_4 using yellow_door_1.
28. Go to door purple_door_1.
29. Go to room_3 using purple_door_1.
30. Go to grey_door_1.
31. Toggle grey_door_1 to unlock it.
32. Go to room_1 using grey_door_1. (We're still holding yellow_ball_2.)
33. Goto empty.
34. Drop yellow_ball_2. (Now yellow_ball_2 is in room_1.)
35. To satisfy the constraint "At some point, yellow_ball_1 must be in room_1," we need to get yellow_ball_1 from room_3 to room_1.
36. Go back to room_3 using grey_door_1.
37. Go to yellow_ball_1.
38. Pick up yellow_ball_1.
39. Go to door grey_door_1.
40. Go to room_1 using grey_door_1.
41. Goto empty.
42. Drop yellow_ball_1. (Now yellow_ball_1 is in room_1, satisfying the constraint.)
43. Finally, to achieve the goal, we need to be in room_1, in front of purple_box_1, which is already in room_1.
44. Go to purple_box_1. (We are now in room_1, in front of purple_box_1, which is also in room_1.)

But wait, I'm forgetting something. In the state description, it says that we have only visited room_2. This means we haven't actually been to rooms 1, 3, or 4 yet. The "goto room" action has an effect that we have visited the room. But this doesn't change our plan, it just means that we're visiting rooms 1, 3, and 4 for the first time.

Now, let's check if this plan satisfies all constraints:
1. "At some point, we must be holding an object." YES, we hold grey_box_1 and yellow_ball_2 at different steps.
2. "At some point, yellow_door_1 must be unlocked." YES, we unlock it.
3. "In every state, red_door_1 must remain locked." YES, we don't unlock it.
4. "At some point, we must be in room_2." YES, we start in room_2 and return to it later.
5. "If we are in room_2, then at that state or some later state, we must be holding yellow_ball_2 and grey_box_1 must be in room_2." YES, when we return to room_2 after dropping grey_box_1 and picking up yellow_ball_2.
6. "At some point, purple_door_1 must be unlocked." YES, we unlock it.
7. "At some point, yellow_ball_1 must be in room_1." YES, we move yellow_ball_1 to room_1.
8. Goal: "Be in room_1, in front of purple_box_1, which should also be in room_1." YES, we end in room_1, in front of purple_box_1.

I've realized that might be more complicated than necessary, because I'm using a complex path to get the objects where they need to be. Let's try a more direct approach.

We're trying to achieve the goal of being in room_1, in front of purple_box_1, which is already in room_1. Let's think about the constraints again. We need:
1. At some point, we must be holding an object.
2. At some point, yellow_door_1 must be unlocked.
3. In every state, red_door_1 must remain locked.
4. At some point, we must be in room_2.
5. If we are in room_2, then at that state or some later state, we must be holding yellow_ball_2 and grey_box_1 must be in room_2.
6. At some point, purple_door_1 must be unlocked.
7. At some point, yellow_ball_1 must be in room_1.

We start in room_2, so constraint 4 is immediately satisfied. Now, we need to satisfy constraint 5, which is the most intricate one because it involves both holding an object and having another object in a specific room.

First, let's get the objects we need:

We are in room_2:
1. Go to the door yellow_door_1.
2. Toggle yellow_door_1 to unlock it. (This satisfies constraint 2.)
3. Go to room_4 using yellow_door_1.

From room_4:
4. Go to the door purple_door_1.
5. Toggle purple_door_1 to unlock it. (This satisfies constraint 6.)
6. Go to room_3 using purple_door_1.

From room_3:
7. Go to grey_box_1.
8. Pick up grey_box_1. (This satisfies constraint 1, holding an object.)
9. Go to door purple_door_1.
10. Go to room_4 using purple_door_1.
11. Go to door yellow_door_1.
12. Go to room_2 using yellow_door_1.
13. Goto empty.
14. Drop grey_box_1. (Now grey_box_1 is in room_2.)
15. Go to door yellow_door_1.
16. Go to room_4 using yellow_door_1.
17. Go to door purple_door_1.
18. Go to room_3 using purple_door_1.
19. Go to yellow_ball_2.
20. Pick up yellow_ball_2.
21. Go to door purple_door_1.
22. Go to room_4 using purple_door_1.
23. Go to door yellow_door_1.
24. Go to room_2 using yellow_door_1. (Now we are in room_2, holding yellow_ball_2, and grey_box_1 is also in room_2, satisfying constraint 5.)

Now we need to get to room_1 to achieve our goal. We can't go directly through red_door_1, so we need to go the long way through room_4 and room_3:

25. Go to door yellow_door_1.
26. Go to room_4 using yellow_door_1.
27. Go to door purple_door_1.
28. Go to room_3 using purple_door_1.
29. Go to door grey_door_1.
30. Toggle grey_door_1 to unlock it.
31. Go to room_1 using grey_door_1. (We're still holding yellow_ball_2.)

Now we need to satisfy constraint 7:

32. Goto empty.
33. Drop yellow_ball_2. (Now yellow_ball_1 is in room_3, and we need to get it to room_1.)
34. Go back to room_3 using grey_door_1.
35. Go to yellow_ball_1.
36. Pick up yellow_ball_1.
37. Go to door grey_door_1.
38. Go to room_1 using grey_door_1.
39. Goto empty.
40. Drop yellow_ball_1. (Now yellow_ball_1 is in room_1, satisfying constraint 7.)

Finally, to achieve the goal, we need to be in room_1, in front of purple_box_1:

41. Go to purple_box_1. (We are now in room_1, in front of purple_box_1, which is also in room_1.)

Alright, now let's double check our constraints once more:
1. "At some point, we must be holding an object." YES, we hold grey_box_1, yellow_ball_2, and yellow_ball_1 at different steps.
2. "At some point, yellow_door_1 must be unlocked." YES, we unlock it.
3. "In every state, red_door_1 must remain locked." YES, we don't unlock it.
4. "At some point, we must be in room_2." YES, we start in room_2 and return to it later.
5. "If we are in room_2, then at that state or some later state, we must be holding yellow_ball_2 and grey_box_1 must be in room_2." YES, when we return to room_2 after dropping grey_box_1 and picking up yellow_ball_2.
6. "At some point, purple_door_1 must be unlocked." YES, we unlock it.
7. "At some point, yellow_ball_1 must be in room_1." YES, we move yellow_ball_1 to room_1.
8. Goal: "Be in room_1, in front of purple_box_1, which should also be in room_1." YES, we end in room_1, in front of purple_box_1.

I think this plan should work and satisfy all the constraints. Let me encode it in the proper format:

```
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_4
toggle yellow_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_4 yellow_door_1
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_3
toggle purple_door_1
gotoroom room_4 room_3 purple_door_1
gotoobject grey_box_1 room_3
pick grey_box_1 room_3
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_4
gotoroom room_3 room_4 purple_door_1
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_2
gotoroom room_4 room_2 yellow_door_1
gotoempty
drop grey_box_1 room_2
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_4
gotoroom room_2 room_4 yellow_door_1
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_3
gotoroom room_4 room_3 purple_door_1
gotoobject yellow_ball_2 room_3
pick yellow_ball_2 room_3
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_4
gotoroom room_3 room_4 purple_door_1
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_2
gotoroom room_4 room_2 yellow_door_1
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_4
gotoroom room_2 room_4 yellow_door_1
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_3
gotoroom room_4 room_3 purple_door_1
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1
toggle grey_door_1
gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1
gotoempty
drop yellow_ball_2 room_1
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_3
gotoroom room_1 room_3 grey_door_1
gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_3
pick yellow_ball_1 room_3
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1
gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1
gotoempty
drop yellow_ball_1 room_1
gotoobject purple_box_1 room_1
```

Hmm, but there's a problem. The goal says that we need to be in room_1, in front of purple_box_1, which should also be in room_1. The initial state says that purple_box_1 is indeed in room_1. But the constraint says "There is a box v such that "The following conditions are all true: "v is purple", "v is in room_1", "you are in room_1", "you are in front of v"". Here, v is a variable that could be any box that satisfies those conditions. We might have more than one purple box.

But the world objects list shows only one purple box, purple_box_1, so that's the one we need to be in front of.

I think the plan is correct, but let me triple check:
1. We start in room_2.
2. We unlock yellow_door_1.
3. We go to room_4, then room_3.
4. We pick up grey_box_1 and bring it to room_2.
5. We pick up yellow_ball_2 from room_3 and bring it to room_2. Now we satisfy: "If you are in room_2, then you must be holding yellow_ball_2 and grey_box_1 must be in room_2."
6. We go to room_4, then room_3, and unlock grey_door_1.
7. We go to room_1 (still holding yellow_ball_2) and drop it.
8. We go back to room_3, pick up yellow_ball_1, bring it to room_1, and drop it. Now we satisfy: "At some point, yellow_ball_1 must be in room_1."
9. We go to purple_box_1 in room_1, achieving the goal.

Given the constraints and the goal, that's the most optimal path I can think of. Let me encode it as a final plan:

```
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_4
toggle yellow_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_4 yellow_door_1
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_3
toggle purple_door_1
gotoroom room_4 room_3 purple_door_1
gotoobject grey_box_1 room_3
pick grey_box_1 room_3
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_4
gotoroom room_3 room_4 purple_door_1
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_2
gotoroom room_4 room_2 yellow_door_1
gotoempty
drop grey_box_1 room_2
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_4
gotoroom room_2 room_4 yellow_door_1
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_3
gotoroom room_4 room_3 purple_door_1
gotoobject yellow_ball_2 room_3
pick yellow_ball_2 room_3
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_4
gotoroom room_3 room_4 purple_door_1
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_2
gotoroom room_4 room_2 yellow_door_1
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_4
gotoroom room_2 room_4 yellow_door_1
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_3
gotoroom room_4 room_3 purple_door_1
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1
toggle grey_door_1
gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1
gotoempty
drop yellow_ball_2 room_1
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_3
gotoroom room_1 room_3 grey_door_1
gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_3
pick yellow_ball_1 room_3
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1
gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1
gotoempty
drop yellow_ball_1 room_1
gotoobject purple_box_1 room_1
```

Wait, before I finalize, let me double check the goal and constraint 5 once more.

Goal: "There is a box v such that The following conditions are all true: 'v is purple', 'v is in room_1', 'you are in room_1', 'you are in front of v'".

Constraint 5: "If expression 'you are in room_2' holds in some state s, then expression 'The following conditions are all true: 'you are holding yellow_ball_2', 'grey_box_1 is in room_2'' must hold at s or at some state after s."

So, once we're in room_2 (which we are at the start and return to later), we need to ensure that at that moment or later, we are holding yellow_ball_2 and grey_box_1 is in room_2. This is exactly what our plan does: we bring grey_box_1 to room_2 and then pick up yellow_ball_2.

One moment, I should check if I'm using the correct format for the actions.

The action "pick" should be: "pick x r" where x is the object and r is the room.
So, the correct format would be: "pick grey_box_1 room_3" not just "pick grey_box_1".

Let me finalize the plan with the correct action formats:

```
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_4
toggle yellow_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_4 yellow_door_1
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_3
toggle purple_door_1
gotoroom room_4 room_3 purple_door_1
gotoobject grey_box_1 room_3
pick grey_box_1 room_3
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_4
gotoroom room_3 room_4 purple_door_1
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_2
gotoroom room_4 room_2 yellow_door_1
gotoempty
drop grey_box_1 room_2
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_4
gotoroom room_2 room_4 yellow_door_1
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_3
gotoroom room_4 room_3 purple_door_1
gotoobject yellow_ball_2 room_3
pick yellow_ball_2 room_3
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_4
gotoroom room_3 room_4 purple_door_1
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_2
gotoroom room_4 room_2 yellow_door_1
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_4
gotoroom room_2 room_4 yellow_door_1
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_3
gotoroom room_4 room_3 purple_door_1
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1
toggle grey_door_1
gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1
gotoempty
drop yellow_ball_2 room_1
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_3
gotoroom room_1 room_3 grey_door_1
gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_3
pick yellow_ball_1 room_3
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1
gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1
gotoempty
drop yellow_ball_1 room_1
gotoobject purple_box_1 room_1
```

This should be the correct plan.
