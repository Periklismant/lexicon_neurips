Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. Hmm, the goal is to have a purple box in room_1, with me in room_1 in front of it. The initial state says the purple_box_1 is already in room_1. Wait, so the goal is already partially met? But the agent needs to be in room_1 and in front of that box. But starting in room_2. So first, I need to get to room_1.

But the doors are all locked initially. The red_door_1 connects room_1 and room_2, but it's locked. To unlock it, I need to toggle it. But to toggle a door, I need to be in front of it. So to get to the red_door_1, I have to go to it from room_2. But are there any objects blocking the door in room_2? The initial state doesn't mention any objects blocking doors. So maybe I can go to the red_door_1 from room_2.

Wait, the preconditions for gotodoor: I need to be in a room connected by the door, and no object is blocking the position in front of the door. Since the initial state doesn't list any objects blocking doors, I can go to the door. Then toggle it to unlock. Then use gotoroom to go from room_2 to room_1 via red_door_1. Once in room_1, I can gotoobject purple_box_1 in room_1. Then drop something if needed, but the goal just requires being in front of the box. Wait, but the goal is to have the box in room_1 (which it already is), me in room_1, and in front of it. So maybe after entering room_1, go to the box.

But let's check constraints. The constraints are:

1. At least one state where I'm holding an object.
2. At least one state where yellow_door_1 is unlocked.
3. In every state, red_door_1 is locked. Wait, but if I unlock red_door_1 to go through, that would violate this constraint. Wait, the third constraint says "red_door_1 is locked" must hold in every state. So if I unlock it, that would make it not locked, which violates the constraint. So I can't toggle the red_door_1. That's a problem. Because initially, all doors are locked. So how do I get to room_1 from room_2 if the red_door_1 is locked and can't be unlocked because that would break the constraint that red_door_1 must always be locked.

Wait, the third constraint says: "The following expression must hold in every state: red_door_1 is locked". So at every state of the plan, red_door_1 must be locked. That means we can never toggle it, because that would unlock it, violating the constraint. Therefore, the red_door_1 must remain locked throughout. So the agent cannot use the red_door_1 to go from room_2 to room_1. So how else can the agent reach room_1?

Looking at the door connections:

- room_2 is connected to room_4 via yellow_door_1, and to room_1 via red_door_1.

Since red_door_1 is locked and must stay locked, the agent can't use that. So maybe take another path. Let's see:

From room_2, the other door is yellow_door_1 leading to room_4. But yellow_door_1 is locked. To go through, need to unlock it. But the second constraint requires that at least once, yellow_door_1 is not locked. So perhaps unlock yellow_door_1, then go to room_4, then from room_4 to room_3 via purple_door_1. But purple_door_1 is also locked. The sixth constraint requires that purple_door_1 is unlocked in at least one state, so we need to toggle that as well. Then from room_3, maybe go to room_1 via grey_door_1, which is locked. So need to unlock that too. But the initial state has all doors locked. Let's think:

Path possibilities:

room_2 -> room_4 (via yellow_door_1, unlock first) -> room_4 -> room_3 (via purple_door_1, unlock) -> room_3 -> room_1 (via grey_door_1, unlock). Then in room_1, go to the purple_box_1.

But this requires unlocking multiple doors. Also, the constraints:

- The agent must hold an object at least once. So need to pick up something.

- The seventh constraint: yellow_ball_1 must be in room_1 in at least one state. Currently, yellow_ball_1 is in room_3. So need to move it. Since the agent can carry objects, maybe pick it up in room_3 and drop it in room_1.

Also, the fifth constraint: if the agent is in room_2 at any state, then either in that state or a later one, the agent must be holding yellow_ball_2 and grey_box_1 is in room_2. The initial state has the agent in room_2, so the first state is room_2. Therefore, either in the initial state or later, when the agent is in room_2 again, they must hold yellow_ball_2 and have grey_box_1 in room_2. But initially, grey_box_1 is in room_3. So this requires moving grey_box_1 to room_2. But the agent can't carry boxes, only pick up objects. Wait, boxes are objects. Wait, the objects include boxes and balls, and the actions allow picking up any object. So the agent can pick up boxes. But boxes may be heavy, but the problem description doesn't mention that. So, possible.

So, let's outline steps:

1. The agent starts in room_2. Since the fifth constraint requires that whenever the agent is in room_2, then they must be holding yellow_ball_2 and grey_box_1 is in room_2 at that state or later. But the agent starts in room_2, so the initial state is room_2. So either in the initial state (which they aren't holding anything, and grey_box_1 is in room_3), so this condition must be met later. So during the plan, whenever the agent is in room_2, either they have yellow_ball_2 and grey_box_1 is in room_2 at that time or later.

This complicates things. So the agent might need to return to room_2 later, but when they do, they must ensure that they are holding yellow_ball_2 and grey_box_1 is in room_2. Alternatively, if the agent leaves room_2 and never returns, then the fifth constraint is satisfied because the agent is not in room_2 in any state except the initial. But the fourth constraint requires that the agent is in room_2 in at least one state. Since the initial state counts, that's covered. However, the fifth constraint says that if the agent is in room_2 in some state, then in that state or a later one, the conditions must hold. The initial state is room_2, but in that state, the agent isn't holding yellow_ball_2, and grey_box_1 is in room_3. So, the agent must, after leaving room_2, eventually bring grey_box_1 to room_2 and pick up yellow_ball_2. But since the agent can't go back through red_door_1 (as it's locked), but maybe through other doors.

But perhaps the plan can avoid returning to room_2. Wait, but the fifth constraint says "if you are in room_2 in some state s, then..." The initial state is s, so in that s, the conditions must hold either at s or after. So the agent must, at some point after the initial state, have grey_box_1 in room_2 and be holding yellow_ball_2. But since the initial state is s0 (room_2), and in s0, the conditions don't hold, they must hold in some state after s0. So the agent needs to, after leaving room_2, eventually bring grey_box_1 to room_2 and have yellow_ball_2 in hand at some point.

But how? Let's think. The grey_box_1 is initially in room_3. The agent needs to get to room_3, pick it up, then bring it to room_2. But to get from room_3 to room_2, possible doors are grey_door_1 (connects room_1 and room_3), so if the agent is in room_3, can go to room_1 via grey_door_1 (if unlocked), then to room_2 via red_door_1. But red_door_1 is locked and must remain locked. So that's not possible. Alternative path: room_3 to room_4 via purple_door_1, then to room_2 via yellow_door_1. So need to unlock those doors.

Yellow_ball_2 is in room_3. So the agent can pick it up when in room_3. So perhaps:

Plan steps:

1. From room_2, go to yellow_door_1 (since it's in room_2 connected to room_4). But yellow_door_1 is locked. So need to toggle it. But to toggle, need to be in front of it. So:

Action: gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_4

Preconditions: in room_2 (yes), door connects room_2 and room_4 (yes), no object blocking. So possible.

Then toggle yellow_door_1. That unlocks it. Now yellow_door_1 is unlocked. This satisfies the second constraint (at least one state where yellow_door_1 is not locked).

Then goto room_4 from room_2 via yellow_door_1.

Now in room_4. Then need to get to room_3 via purple_door_1. But purple_door_1 is locked. So need to toggle it. So go to purple_door_1 in room_4 (gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_3). Then toggle it. Now purple_door_1 is unlocked (satisfies constraint 6). Then goto room_3.

In room_3, there are several objects: yellow_ball_1, blue_box_1, yellow_ball_2, grey_box_1.

The seventh constraint requires that yellow_ball_1 is in room_1 at least once. So need to move it. So pick up yellow_ball_1 in room_3, then carry it to room_1. But how to get to room_1 from room_3? The grey_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3. So unlock grey_door_1. But grey_door_1 is initially locked. So go to grey_door_1 in room_3 (gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1). Then toggle to unlock. Now grey_door_1 is unlocked. Then goto room_1.

But wait, after entering room_1, the agent is in room_1. Then drop yellow_ball_1 here. That satisfies the seventh constraint.

But also, the fifth constraint requires that after leaving room_2, the agent must eventually have grey_box_1 in room_2 and hold yellow_ball_2. So after handling the room_1 part, the agent needs to go back to room_3, pick up grey_box_1 and yellow_ball_2, then bring them to room_2.

But how? Let's see:

Once in room_1, the agent can go back to room_3 via grey_door_1 (unlocked), then from room_3 to room_4 via purple_door_1 (unlocked), then from room_4 to room_2 via yellow_door_1 (unlocked). Then drop grey_box_1 in room_2 and hold yellow_ball_2.

But the agent can carry only one object at a time. So need to handle these steps carefully.

Alternatively, the agent can pick up grey_box_1 in room_3, carry it to room_4, then to room_2. Then drop it. Then return to room_3 to pick up yellow_ball_2, carry to room_2. But this might take many steps.

But let's outline the steps:

1. Start in room_2.
2. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_4
3. toggle yellow_door_1 (now unlocked)
4. gotoroom room_2 room_4 yellow_door_1 (now in room_4)
5. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_3
6. toggle purple_door_1 (unlocks it)
7. gotoroom room_4 room_3 purple_door_1 (now in room_3)
8. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_3
9. pick grey_box_1 room_3 (now holding it)
   - This satisfies constraint 1 (holding an object)
10. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_4
11. toggle purple_door_1 (lock it again? No, because we need to go back. Wait, step 6 toggled it to unlock. After step 6, it's unlocked. Step 10, if we toggle again, it would lock it. But step 11 is toggling again. So maybe better to not toggle again here. Wait, no. After step 7, the agent is in room_3. To go back to room_4, they need to use purple_door_1 again. So if the door is unlocked, they can go through. But step 10 is going to the door in room_3. Then step 11 is toggling, which would lock it. That might complicate things. But perhaps the agent can go through without toggling again.

Wait, once the purple_door_1 is unlocked (from step 6), the agent can go back and forth between room_3 and room_4. So after step 7, in room_3, after picking up grey_box_1, the agent can go back to room_4 via purple_door_1 without needing to toggle again (since it's already unlocked). So steps:

8. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_3
9. pick grey_box_1 room_3
10. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_4
11. gotoroom room_3 room_4 purple_door_1 (now in room_4)
12. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_2
13. gotoroom room_4 room_2 yellow_door_1 (now in room_2)
14. drop grey_box_1 room_2 (this places grey_box_1 in room_2, satisfying part of constraint 5)
15. Now, need to pick up yellow_ball_2. But yellow_ball_2 is in room_3. So the agent needs to go back to room_3.

But this will take more steps. From room_2, go to room_4 via yellow_door_1 (unlocked), then to room_3 via purple_door_1 (unlocked). Then gotoobject yellow_ball_2 room_3, pick it up, then return to room_2.

So steps:

16. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_4
17. gotoroom room_2 room_4 yellow_door_1
18. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_3
19. gotoroom room_4 room_3 purple_door_1
20. gotoobject yellow_ball_2 room_3
21. pick yellow_ball_2 room_3 (now holding it)
22. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_4
23. gotoroom room_3 room_4 purple_door_1
24. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_2
25. gotoroom room_4 room_2 yellow_door_1 (now in room_2, holding yellow_ball_2)
26. Now, in room_2, holding yellow_ball_2, and grey_box_1 is in room_2 (from step 14). This satisfies constraint 5.

But the agent needs to drop the ball somewhere. But the constraints don't require holding it in the final state. So after step 25, the agent is in room_2, holding yellow_ball_2, and grey_box_1 is in room_2. The fifth constraint is satisfied because in this state, the agent is in room_2, holding yellow_ball_2, and grey_box_1 is there. Then, the agent can drop it, but that's optional.

But the main goal is to be in room_1 in front of purple_box_1. So after handling constraint 5, the agent needs to proceed to room_1.

But how? Since red_door_1 is locked and can't be toggled, the agent must take the long way: from room_2 to room_4, then to room_3, then to room_1 via grey_door_1 (needs to unlock it).

So after step 25:

27. drop yellow_ball_2 room_2 (optional, but to free hands)
28. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_4
29. gotoroom room_2 room_4 yellow_door_1
30. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_3
31. gotoroom room_4 room_3 purple_door_1 (now in room_3)
32. Now, need to unlock grey_door_1 to go to room_1.

But grey_door_1 is in room_3, connecting to room_1. It's initially locked. So:

32. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1
33. toggle grey_door_1 (unlocks it)
34. gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1 (now in room_1)
35. gotoobject purple_box_1 room_1 (now in front of it)
36. Now, the agent is in room_1 in front of purple_box_1. The goal is met.

But also, need to ensure that yellow_ball_1 is in room_1 at some point. Currently, yellow_ball_1 is in room_3. So the agent needs to move it. Let's see: in room_3, after step 31, the agent is in room_3 again. So between steps 31 and 32, the agent can pick up yellow_ball_1.

Wait, let's adjust the steps. After step 31, in room_3, perhaps:

31. gotoroom room_4 room_3 purple_door_1 (now in room_3)
32. gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_3
33. pick yellow_ball_1 room_3 (now holding it)
34. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1
35. toggle grey_door_1 (unlock)
36. gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1 (now in room_1)
37. drop yellow_ball_1 room_1 (now it's in room_1, satisfying constraint 7)
38. gotoobject purple_box_1 room_1

Now, the agent is in room_1 in front of purple_box_1, which is the goal. Also, all constraints are satisfied:

- Held an object (grey_box_1, yellow_ball_2, yellow_ball_1)
- yellow_door_1 was unlocked (step 3)
- red_door_1 remained locked throughout (never toggled)
- agent was in room_2 (initial state, and later steps)
- when in room_2 (steps 14 and 25), grey_box_1 is there and agent held yellow_ball_2
- purple_door_1 was unlocked (step 6)
- yellow_ball_1 is in room_1 (step 37)

So this seems to cover all constraints.

But let's check the steps again for correctness.

The initial steps:

1. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_4 (agent is in room_2)
2. toggle yellow_door_1 (now unlocked)
3. gotoroom room_2 room_4 yellow_door_1 (now in room_4)
4. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_3
5. toggle purple_door_1 (unlocks it)
6. gotoroom room_4 room_3 purple_door_1 (now in room_3)
7. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_3
8. pick grey_box_1 room_3 (holding it)
9. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_4
10. gotoroom room_3 room_4 purple_door_1 (now in room_4)
11. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_2
12. gotoroom room_4 room_2 yellow_door_1 (now in room_2)
13. drop grey_box_1 room_2 (now grey_box_1 is in room_2)
14. Now need to pick up yellow_ball_2. So:
15. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_4
16. gotoroom room_2 room_4 yellow_door_1 (room_4)
17. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_3
18. gotoroom room_4 room_3 purple_door_1 (room_3)
19. gotoobject yellow_ball_2 room_3
20. pick yellow_ball_2 room_3 (now holding it)
21. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_4
22. gotoroom room_3 room_4 purple_door_1 (room_4)
23. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_2
24. gotoroom room_4 room_2 yellow_door_1 (room_2)
25. Now in room_2 holding yellow_ball_2, grey_box_1 is here. So constraint 5 is satisfied.
26. drop yellow_ball_2 room_2 (optional, but needed to free hands)
27. Now, to go to room_1, need to unlock grey_door_1. So:
28. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_4
29. gotoroom room_2 room_4 yellow_door_1 (room_4)
30. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_3
31. gotoroom room_4 room_3 purple_door_1 (room_3)
32. gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_3
33. pick yellow_ball_1 room_3
34. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1
35. toggle grey_door_1 (unlock)
36. gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1 (now in room_1)
37. drop yellow_ball_1 room_1 (satisfies constraint 7)
38. gotoobject purple_box_1 room_1 (goal met)

But during step 35, toggling grey_door_1, which was initially locked. Now it's unlocked. But the constraint only requires that red_door_1 is always locked. So that's okay.

Now, check all constraints:

- Held object: steps 8, 20, 33: yes.
- yellow_door_1 unlocked in step 2: yes.
- red_door_1 always locked: never toggled, yes.
- in room_2 in steps 1, 12, 24: yes.
- when in room_2 (steps 1 is initial, but in step 12, after dropping grey_box_1, and in step 24, holding yellow_ball_2), the fifth constraint requires that either in that state or later, the agent is holding yellow_ball_2 and grey_box_1 is in room_2. At step 12, grey_box_1 is in room_2 but agent is not holding yellow_ball_2. At step 24, agent is holding yellow_ball_2 and grey_box_1 is in room_2. So in state after step 24, the fifth constraint is satisfied.
- purple_door_1 was unlocked in step 5: yes.
- yellow_ball_1 is in room_1 after step 37: yes.

The plan seems to satisfy all constraints and reach the goal. Now, check for optimality. The steps could be optimized. For example, after dropping grey_box_1 in room_2 (step 13), instead of immediately going back to get yellow_ball_2, maybe first handle moving yellow_ball_1 to room_1. Or find a shorter path.

But considering all the required steps, this seems to be the minimal path. Each necessary action is included. So the final plan would be the sequence of actions as outlined.
