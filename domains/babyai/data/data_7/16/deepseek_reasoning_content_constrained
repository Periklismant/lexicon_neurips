Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. The goal is to get to a situation where there's a purple door (which must be purple_door_1) connecting room_3 and room_4, I'm in front of it, and it's unlocked. Plus, there are several constraints to satisfy. Let's break this down step by step.

First, the initial state: I'm in room_2. All doors are locked. The purple_door_1 connects room_3 and room_4. To reach that door, I need to get to room_3 or room_4. But all doors are locked, so I need to unlock them. However, the constraints say that blue_door_2 must always remain locked. So I can't use blue_door_2 to move between room_2 and room_4. Hmm, that complicates things.

Constraints to remember:
- Must be in front of blue_door_2 at least once, but before that, must be holding grey_box_1. Also, blue_door_2 must stay locked always. So even if I go there, I can't toggle it. Wait, but the toggle action requires being in front of the door. But since blue_door_2 must stay locked, I can't unlock it. So the only way to satisfy the "in front of blue_door_2" is to go there but not toggle it. But how can I do that if the door is locked? Because to go through a door, it must be unlocked. But since blue_door_2 is locked and must stay that way, maybe I can just go to the door in room_2 without going through it. Let's check the "gotodoor" action's preconditions. It says I can go in front of door d if I'm in a room connected by d and no object is blocking the position in front of d. So if there's no object blocking, I can go there. But in the initial state, are there any objects blocking blue_door_2 in room_2? The initial objects in room_2 are yellow_ball_1 and grey_box_1. So unless they are in front of the door, which isn't specified. Maybe by default, they are not blocking. So I can go to blue_door_2 in room_2. But I need to hold grey_box_1 before that. So I need to pick up grey_box_1 in room_2, then go to blue_door_2, then drop it maybe? But after that, I need to proceed.

Another constraint: Must be in room_4 at least once. And before entering room_4, either yellow_ball_1 is in room_4 or red_ball_1 is in room_2. Initially, red_ball_1 is in room_1. So that condition isn't met. So I need to move either yellow_ball_1 to room_4 or red_ball_1 to room_2. But moving red_ball_1 to room_2 would require going to room_1, picking it up, bringing it back. But how to get to room_1 from room_2? The red_door_1 is locked. So I need to unlock red_door_1. But to unlock it, I have to be in front of it. To get there, since I'm in room_2, I can go to red_door_1 in room_2. Then toggle it. Then I can go through to room_1. Alternatively, maybe there's another way. Let's think.

Also, the goal requires purple_door_1 to be unlocked. So I need to be in front of it and toggle it. But to get to purple_door_1, I have to be in room_3 or room_4. But initial position is room_2. How to get there? Let's look at the connections. From room_2, doors are red_door_1 (connects to room_1) and blue_door_2 (connects to room_4, but it's locked and must stay locked). So blue_door_2 can't be used. So the only way out of room_2 is red_door_1. But red_door_1 is locked. So first step: unlock red_door_1.

But to unlock red_door_1, I need to be in front of it. Since I'm in room_2, I can go to red_door_1 (gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_1), then toggle it. But preconditions: to go to the door, no object is blocking. Are there any objects in room_2 in front of red_door_1? The initial objects in room_2 are yellow_ball_1 and grey_box_1. Unless they are placed in front of doors, which isn't specified. Assuming they are not, so I can go to red_door_1, then toggle it. Then go through to room_1.

But let's check constraints. One constraint says that in some state, blue_door_1 must be unlocked. Blue_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3. So maybe after going to room_1, I can unlock blue_door_1. But how? To unlock blue_door_1, I need to be in front of it. So in room_1, I can go to blue_door_1, then toggle it. Then go to room_3. Then in room_3, I can go to purple_door_1 (connecting to room_4), unlock it, and be in front of it.

But wait, the goal is to have purple_door_1 unlocked and be in front of it. So maybe after unlocking purple_door_1, I can be in front of it. Let's outline possible steps:

1. From room_2, go to red_door_1 (gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_1)
2. Toggle red_door_1 to unlock it.
3. Gotoroom room_2 room_1 red_door_1. Now in room_1.
4. In room_1, there's red_ball_1, red_ball_2, yellow_box_1. Need to pick up grey_box_1, but that's in room_2. Wait, no. Wait, the constraint about being in front of blue_door_2 requires holding grey_box_1. So maybe I need to first get grey_box_1 from room_2. But that's where I started. So perhaps:

But initial steps:

Start in room_2. Need to go to blue_door_2, but before that, hold grey_box_1. So first, pick up grey_box_1 in room_2.

But to pick up grey_box_1, I need to be in front of it. So:

1. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_2
2. pick grey_box_1 room_2
3. gotodoor blue_door_2 room_2 room_4 (since I need to be in front of blue_door_2)
4. Now, the constraint is satisfied: in front of blue_door_2 and previously held grey_box_1. Then maybe drop it, but not sure yet.

But after that, I need to proceed. But blue_door_2 is locked and must remain so. So I can't go through it. So how do I get to room_4? Because one constraint requires being in room_4. But the only other way to room_4 is from room_2 via blue_door_2 (locked) or from room_3 via purple_door_1. So perhaps I need to go through room_1 to room_3, then to room_4.

But how to get to room_3? From room_1, there's blue_door_1 connecting to room_3, but it's locked. So need to unlock blue_door_1. Let's see:

So after picking grey_box_1 and going to blue_door_2 in room_2, maybe then proceed to unlock red_door_1.

Wait, but after step 3, I'm holding grey_box_1 and in front of blue_door_2. Then I need to drop it somewhere, but maybe not necessary. Let's see:

After step 3, I'm in front of blue_door_2. Then, maybe I can drop the grey_box_1 here? But the drop action requires being in front of an empty position. Wait, no: the drop action's precondition is that you are holding the object, and the position in front is empty. Wait, no, the preconditions for drop are: (i) holding x, (ii) the position in front is empty. Wait, but the "drop x r" action's effect is that you drop x in room r, but you need to be in front of an empty position. Wait, the "drop" action requires that you are in the room where you drop it. So if I'm in room_2, I can drop grey_box_1 there. But if I'm in front of blue_door_2 in room_2, then after dropping, the grey_box_1 would be in room_2, possibly blocking the door? Because the effect of drop is that x is in the room you're currently in. But the problem says that if an object is in front of a door, it blocks it. So if I drop grey_box_1 in front of blue_door_2, then the next time I try to go to that door, it's blocked. But since the constraint is that blue_door_2 must stay locked, maybe that's okay. But perhaps I should drop it elsewhere. But maybe it's not necessary to drop it yet. Let's see.

But after satisfying the constraint of being in front of blue_door_2 while having held grey_box_1, maybe I can proceed to unlock red_door_1.

But to do that, I need to go to red_door_1 in room_2. But right now, I'm in front of blue_door_2. So first, I need to go to red_door_1. So:

4. gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_1
5. toggle red_door_1 (unlocks it)
6. gotoroom room_2 room_1 red_door_1 (now in room_1)

Now, in room_1, I can go to blue_door_1 (connecting to room_3). But blue_door_1 is locked. So:

7. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_3
8. toggle blue_door_1 (unlocks it) → satisfies the constraint that blue_door_1 is unlocked in some state.
9. gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_1 (now in room_3)

In room_3, there's purple_ball_1 and green_box_1. Also, the purple_door_1 connects to room_4. But purple_door_1 is locked. So:

10. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_4
11. toggle purple_door_1 (unlocks it) → this would satisfy the goal's requirement that d (purple_door_1) is not locked. Also, being in front of purple_door_1. But the goal requires being in front of it and it's unlocked. So after this toggle, we are in front of it and it's unlocked. But the goal requires that in the final state, those conditions hold. So after this action, we might need to be in front of it. Let's see.

But after step 11, the door is unlocked, and we are in front of it. So that satisfies the goal. But the problem says the final goal is that "There is a door d such that..." So if after step 11, we are in front of purple_door_1 and it's unlocked, that would meet the goal. But we also need to check other constraints.

Other constraints:

- Must have at least one state where purple_ball_1 is in room_1 and yellow_ball_1 is in room_3. So how to achieve that? Purple_ball_1 starts in room_3. To get it to room_1, we need to pick it up in room_3 and carry it to room_1. Similarly, yellow_ball_1 starts in room_2. To get it to room_3, we need to carry it from room_2 to room_3. But how to get from room_2 to room_3? Let's see the path: room_2 → room_1 via red_door_1 (if unlocked), then room_1 → room_3 via blue_door_1 (unlocked). Then room_3 → room_1 again. So possible.

But let's track the steps. Let's say after step 9, I'm in room_3. Then I can pick up purple_ball_1 and take it to room_1. Then, also, get yellow_ball_1 from room_2 to room_3. Let's see.

But let's also remember the constraint that red_ball_2 must be in room_3 at some point. So red_ball_2 is in room_1 initially. Need to move it to room_3.

This is getting complex. Let's outline the steps needed to satisfy all constraints:

1. Must be in front of blue_door_2 while having held grey_box_1. So first, pick up grey_box_1 in room_2, then go to blue_door_2.

2. Must be in room_4. So need to get there. Since blue_door_2 is locked and can't be toggled, the only path is room_3 → room_4 via purple_door_1. So need to get to room_3, then room_4.

3. Before entering room_4, need to have either yellow_ball_1 in room_4 or red_ball_1 in room_2. Let's see: red_ball_1 is in room_1. So perhaps easier to move yellow_ball_1 from room_2 to room_4. But how? From room_2, can't go to room_4 via blue_door_2 (locked). So need to go via room_1 → room_3 → room_4. So pick up yellow_ball_1 in room_2, carry it through room_1, room_3, to room_4.

But to carry objects, need to have hands free. So steps would involve picking and dropping as needed.

Also, the constraint that purple_ball_1 is in room_1 and yellow_ball_1 is in room_3. So:

- Move purple_ball_1 from room_3 to room_1.

- Move yellow_ball_1 from room_2 to room_3.

Plus, red_ball_2 must be in room_3.

This requires a lot of object movement. Let's plan this.

First, handle the initial steps to unlock doors and get to room_3.

Initial steps:

1. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_2
2. pick grey_box_1 room_2 → now holding it
3. gotodoor blue_door_2 room_2 room_4 → now in front of blue_door_2, which satisfies the constraint with holding grey_box_1 earlier
4. drop grey_box_1 room_2 → since we need to free hands for other actions. But where? If we drop in room_2, maybe in front of blue_door_2, but then that blocks the door. But since we can't use that door anyway, maybe it's okay. Or drop elsewhere. Maybe after step 3, we can go to an empty position in room_2 to drop.

Wait, after step 3, we're in front of blue_door_2. To drop, we need to be in front of an empty position. So:

4. gotoempty (in room_2)
5. drop grey_box_1 room_2 → now grey_box_1 is in room_2, but not blocking the door.

Then proceed to unlock red_door_1:

6. gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_1
7. toggle red_door_1 → unlocks it
8. gotoroom room_2 room_1 red_door_1 → now in room_1

Now in room_1. Need to unlock blue_door_1 to get to room_3.

9. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_3
10. toggle blue_door_1 → unlocks it (satisfies the constraint that blue_door_1 is unlocked in some state)
11. gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_1 → now in room_3

In room_3, need to handle purple_ball_1 and green_box_1. Also, need to unlock purple_door_1.

12. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_4
13. toggle purple_door_1 → unlocks it (now, this door is unlocked)
14. → Now, we are in front of purple_door_1 in room_3, which is unlocked. But the goal requires being in front of d (purple_door_1) and it's not locked. So this satisfies the goal. But wait, the goal is a final state. So after this action, the current state would have us in front of purple_door_1, which is unlocked. So perhaps this is the final step. But there are other constraints to satisfy.

Other constraints:

- purple_ball_1 in room_1 and yellow_ball_1 in room_3. So need to move them.

Let's see. From room_3, we can go back to room_1 via blue_door_1. Let's pick up purple_ball_1:

15. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_3
16. pick purple_ball_1 room_3 → now holding it
17. gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_1 → back to room_1
18. drop purple_ball_1 room_1 → now purple_ball_1 is in room_1. This satisfies part of that constraint.

Now, need to get yellow_ball_1 to room_3. Yellow_ball_1 is in room_2. So:

19. gotoroom room_1 room_2 red_door_1 → back to room_2
20. gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2
21. pick yellow_ball_1 room_2 → holding it
22. gotoroom room_2 room_1 red_door_1 → to room_1
23. gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_1 → to room_3
24. drop yellow_ball_1 room_3 → now yellow_ball_1 is in room_3. This satisfies the other part of the constraint.

Now, the constraint that red_ball_2 must be in room_3. red_ball_2 is in room_1. So:

25. gotoobject red_ball_2 room_1
26. pick red_ball_2 room_1 → holding it
27. gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_1 → to room_3
28. drop red_ball_2 room_3 → now in room_3.

Now, the constraint to be in room_4. So from room_3, via purple_door_1 (unlocked):

29. gotoroom room_3 room_4 purple_door_1 → now in room_4. This satisfies the constraint of being in room_4. But before entering room_4, we need to have either yellow_ball_1 in room_4 or red_ball_1 in room_2. At this point, yellow_ball_1 is in room_3, not 4. Red_ball_1 is in room_1. So this doesn't satisfy the precondition for entering room_4. Wait, this is a problem. Because according to the constraints, if I'm in room_4 in some state, there must be an earlier state where yellow_ball_1 is in room_4 or red_ball_1 is in room_2.

So before entering room_4 (step 29), I need to ensure that either yellow_ball_1 is in room_4 or red_ball_1 is in room_2. Currently, red_ball_1 is in room_1, yellow_ball_1 is in room_3. So neither condition holds. Therefore, I need to adjust the plan.

So perhaps before entering room_4, I need to move yellow_ball_1 to room_4. Let's see. To do that, after step 24, when yellow_ball_1 is in room_3, I need to pick it up again and take it to room_4. But room_4 is accessible via purple_door_1. Let's adjust steps:

After step 24 (yellow_ball_1 in room_3):

25. gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_3
26. pick yellow_ball_1 room_3 → holding it
27. gotoroom room_3 room_4 purple_door_1 → now in room_4
28. drop yellow_ball_1 room_4 → now yellow_ball_1 is in room_4. Now, the condition for entering room_4 is satisfied (yellow_ball_1 is in room_4). So when we enter room_4 again later, it's okay. But we need to have been in room_4 at least once. So step 27 already puts us in room_4, satisfying that constraint.

But then, after that, we need to handle red_ball_2. So let's continue:

29. gotoroom room_4 room_3 purple_door_1 → back to room_3
30. Now, pick up red_ball_2 (which is in room_1). Wait, no, red_ball_2 is in room_1. So we need to go back to room_1. This is getting complicated. Maybe there's a better path.

Alternatively, after moving yellow_ball_1 to room_4 (step 28), then we can proceed to enter room_4 again. But perhaps that's overcomplicating. Let's see.

Wait, the constraint says that if you are in room_4 in some state, there must be an earlier state where either yellow_ball_1 is in room_4 or red_ball_1 is in room_2. So the first time we enter room_4 (step 27), we need to have satisfied that condition. But at that point, the only way is if yellow_ball_1 was moved to room_4 before entering. So in this case, step 27 is entering room_4 for the first time, and before that, we moved yellow_ball_1 to room_4. Wait, but step 27 is entering room_4 with yellow_ball_1 in hand. When we drop it in room_4 (step 28), then yellow_ball_1 is in room_4. So when we entered room_4 in step 27, the condition wasn't met yet, because yellow_ball_1 wasn't in room_4. But after step 28, it is. So if later we enter room_4 again, that's okay. But the first entry into room_4 (step 27) doesn't satisfy the condition. So this is a problem.

Alternative approach: Before entering room_4 for the first time, ensure that yellow_ball_1 is already in room_4 or red_ball_1 is in room_2. Since red_ball_1 is in room_1, moving it to room_2 would require:

From room_1, pick red_ball_1, take it to room_2. Let's see:

After step 18 (purple_ball_1 in room_1):

19. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_1
20. pick red_ball_1 room_1 → holding it
21. gotoroom room_1 room_2 red_door_1 → to room_2
22. drop red_ball_1 room_2 → now red_ball_1 is in room_2. This satisfies the condition that before entering room_4, red_ball_1 is in room_2. Now, when entering room_4, this condition holds.

Then proceed to room_3 and room_4 as before.

But this adds more steps. Let's integrate this into the plan.

Revised steps after step 18 (purple_ball_1 in room_1):

19. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_1
20. pick red_ball_1 room_1 → holding it
21. gotoroom room_1 room_2 red_door_1 → to room_2
22. drop red_ball_1 room_2 → now red_ball_1 is in room_2. This satisfies the condition for entering room_4 later.

Now, proceed to room_3 and room_4:

23. gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2
24. pick yellow_ball_1 room_2 → holding it
25. gotoroom room_2 room_1 red_door_1 → to room_1
26. gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_1 → to room_3
27. drop yellow_ball_1 room_3 → now in room_3. This satisfies part of the purple_ball_1 and yellow_ball_1 constraint.
28. Now, move purple_ball_1 to room_1 is already done. So next, red_ball_2 to room_3.

But red_ball_2 is in room_1. So:

29. gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_1 → to room_1
30. gotoobject red_ball_2 room_1
31. pick red_ball_2 room_1 → holding it
32. gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_1 → to room_3
33. drop red_ball_2 room_3 → now in room_3. Satisfies the red_ball_2 in room_3 constraint.

Now, need to unlock purple_door_1 and be in front of it.

34. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_4
35. toggle purple_door_1 → unlocks it. Now, in front of unlocked door, which is the goal.

Now, need to get to room_4 to satisfy the constraint of being in room_4. But before entering, we have red_ball_1 in room_2. So:

36. gotoroom room_3 room_4 purple_door_1 → now in room_4. Since red_ball_1 is in room_2 (from step 22), this satisfies the condition.

So now, all constraints are met:

- At step 3: in front of blue_door_2 after holding grey_box_1.

- blue_door_2 remains locked.

- In step 36: in room_4, with prior state of red_ball_1 in room_2.

- Purple_ball_1 in room_1 (step 18), yellow_ball_1 in room_3 (step 27).

- In step 34: in front of purple_door_1. The constraint here requires that before that, either in room_1 or holding yellow_box_1. At step 34, prior steps include being in room_1 (steps 29-32). So that's satisfied.

- blue_door_1 was toggled unlocked in step 10.

- red_ball_2 in room_3 (step 33).

- The goal is achieved in step 35: in front of purple_door_1, which is unlocked.

But need to check the exact order. Let's list all the steps again, ensuring they're in order and preconditions are met.

But this is getting quite long. Let's compile the steps:

1. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_2
2. pick grey_box_1 room_2
3. gotodoor blue_door_2 room_2 room_4
4. gotoempty room_2
5. drop grey_box_1 room_2
6. gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_1
7. toggle red_door_1
8. gotoroom room_2 room_1 red_door_1
9. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_3
10. toggle blue_door_1
11. gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_1
12. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_3
13. pick purple_ball_1 room_3
14. gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_1
15. drop purple_ball_1 room_1
16. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_1
17. pick red_ball_1 room_1
18. gotoroom room_1 room_2 red_door_1
19. drop red_ball_1 room_2
20. gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2
21. pick yellow_ball_1 room_2
22. gotoroom room_2 room_1 red_door_1
23. gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_1
24. drop yellow_ball_1 room_3
25. gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_1
26. gotoobject red_ball_2 room_1
27. pick red_ball_2 room_1
28. gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_1
29. drop red_ball_2 room_3
30. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_4
31. toggle purple_door_1
32. gotoroom room_3 room_4 purple_door_1

Now, check if each action's preconditions are met.

But this is quite lengthy. Maybe there's a shorter path. Let's consider optimizing steps.

Alternative approach: After unlocking red_door_1 and blue_door_1, go to room_3, unlock purple_door_1, then proceed to room_4. But need to handle constraints.

Wait, after step 11, I'm in room_3. Then:

12. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_4
13. toggle purple_door_1 (unlock)
14. gotoroom room_3 room_4 purple_door_1 → now in room_4 (satisfies being in room_4). Before entering room_4, need to have yellow_ball_1 in room_4 or red_ball_1 in room_2. But at this point, neither is true. So this would violate the constraint. Therefore, need to arrange that before entering room_4 the first time.

So maybe, before entering room_4, move red_ball_1 to room_2.

But how? Let's see:

After unlocking red_door_1 and blue_door_1, go back to room_2 to move red_ball_1.

But this adds backtracking. Let's try:

1. goto grey_box_1, pick, goto blue_door_2, drop (steps 1-5)
2. unlock red_door_1, go to room_1
3. unlock blue_door_1, go to room_3
4. unlock purple_door_1, but don't enter yet
5. go back to room_1, pick red_ball_1, take to room_2, drop
6. then go to room_3, then to room_4.

But this involves more steps.

Alternatively, after step 5 (drop grey_box_1), go to room_1, pick red_ball_1, drop in room_2, then proceed.

Let me try:

1. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_2
2. pick grey_box_1 room_2
3. gotodoor blue_door_2 room_2 room_4
4. gotoempty room_2
5. drop grey_box_1 room_2
6. gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_1
7. toggle red_door_1
8. gotoroom room_2 room_1 red_door_1
9. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_1
10. pick red_ball_1 room_1
11. gotoroom room_1 room_2 red_door_1
12. drop red_ball_1 room_2 → now red_ball_1 in room_2
13. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_3 → wait, no, after step 11, we're in room_2. Need to go back to room_1.

Wait, after step 11, we're in room_2. To unlock blue_door_1, need to go to room_1 again.

14. gotoroom room_2 room_1 red_door_1
15. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_3
16. toggle blue_door_1
17. gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_1
18. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_4
19. toggle purple_door_1
20. gotoroom room_3 room_4 purple_door_1 → now in room_4. Before this step, red_ball_1 is in room_2 (step 12), so condition satisfied.

Then handle the other constraints:

- purple_ball_1 to room_1, yellow_ball_1 to room_3.

From room_4, need to go back to room_3:

21. gotoroom room_4 room_3 purple_door_1
22. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_3
23. pick purple_ball_1 room_3
24. gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_1
25. drop purple_ball_1 room_1

Then, yellow_ball_1 from room_2 to room_3:

26. gotoroom room_1 room_2 red_door_1
27. gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2
28. pick yellow_ball_1 room_2
29. gotoroom room_2 room_1 red_door_1
30. gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_1
31. drop yellow_ball_1 room_3

Then, red_ball_2 to room_3:

32. gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_1
33. gotoobject red_ball_2 room_1
34. pick red_ball_2 room_1
35. gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_1
36. drop red_ball_2 room_3

Finally, ensure in front of purple_door_1 and it's unlocked:

37. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_4
38. → here, we are in front of purple_door_1, which is unlocked (step 19). So this meets the goal.

But in this plan, step 19 toggles purple_door_1 to unlock it, and step 37 is gotodoor purple_door_1 in room_3. So after step 19, we are in front of purple_door_1. Wait, step 19 is toggle, which requires being in front of it. So after step 18 (gotoroom to room_4), we are in room_4. Wait, no. Let's correct:

After step 17: in room_3.

18. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_4
19. toggle purple_door_1 → now unlocked
20. gotoroom room_3 room_4 purple_door_1 → now in room_4 (step 20)

But after step 19, we are in front of purple_door_1 in room_3, having toggled it. So that satisfies the goal: being in front of d (purple_door_1), d is purple, connects room_3 and 4, and not locked. So the final state after step 19 meets the goal. But we need to ensure that the plan ends with the goal state. However, after step 20, we are in room_4. But the goal requires being in front of the door. So the final action should be gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_4 and toggle it, then stop there. But in the current plan, after toggling, we go to room_4. Which moves us away from the door.

So perhaps the optimal plan is to unlock purple_door_1 and stay in front of it. Let's adjust:

After step 19: in front of purple_door_1, toggled to unlocked. That meets the goal. Then the plan can end here. But other constraints may require additional steps. However, the other constraints are to have certain states at some point, not necessarily in the final state. So even if after step 19, we are in front of the door, which meets the goal, then proceed to other steps to meet other constraints.

Wait, the goal is a final state. So the final state must satisfy the goal conditions. So after step 19, we are in front of purple_door_1, which is unlocked, and it's purple. So that's the goal. So the plan can end there. But the other constraints need to be satisfied somewhere in the plan.

But in this approach, some constraints are not yet met. For example, purple_ball_1 needs to be in room_1, and yellow_ball_1 in room_3. So steps after step 19 would be needed. But if we end the plan at step 19, the other constraints wouldn't be met. So we need to ensure all constraints are met at some state in the plan.

So the plan must include steps to satisfy all constraints, even if they are not in the final state. So the final state is the goal, but other states must satisfy the other constraints.

This makes the problem quite complex. The optimal plan would be the shortest sequence that satisfies all constraints and the goal. Given the complexity, I think the initial plan I outlined earlier may be too long. Perhaps there's a shorter way.

Alternative Idea:

- Use the fact that after unlocking purple_door_1, being in front of it meets the goal. So focus on reaching there while fulfilling constraints.

Steps:

1. Pick grey_box_1 in room_2.
2. Go to blue_door_2 (satisfies constraint).
3. Drop grey_box_1.
4. Unlock red_door_1.
5. Go to room_1.
6. Unlock blue_door_1.
7. Go to room_3.
8. Unlock purple_door_1 (now in front of it, goal met).

But need to handle other constraints:

- Must move yellow_ball_1 to room_3 and purple_ball_1 to room_1.

But after step 8, we can:

9. Pick purple_ball_1 in room_3.
10. Go to room_1 via blue_door_1.
11. Drop in room_1.
12. Go back to room_2 via red_door_1.
13. Pick yellow_ball_1.
14. Go to room_1, then room_3, drop in room_3.
15. Go to room_1, pick red_ball_2, drop in room_3.

Also, need to be in room_4 at least once. But purple_door_1 is unlocked. So after step 8, can go to room_4. But before that, ensure yellow_ball_1 is in room_4 or red_ball_1 in room_2. Let's say after step 14, yellow_ball_1 is in room_3. So to enter room_4, need to move yellow_ball_1 to room_4. Or move red_ball_1 to room_2.

Let's say after step 11 (purple_ball_1 in room_1), step 12-14 (yellow_ball_1 in room_3), then move to room_4:

16. Go to room_4 via purple_door_1 (from room_3). But before entering, need to meet the condition. So either yellow_ball_1 is in room_4 or red_ball_1 in room_2. At this point, red_ball_1 is in room_1. So need to move yellow_ball_1 to room_4.

17. Pick yellow_ball_1 from room_3.
18. Go to room_4, drop it.
19. Now, when entering room_4 again, condition is met.

But this adds steps. Alternatively, after step 14, move red_ball_1 to room_2.

But red_ball_1 is in room_1. So:

15. Go to room_1.
16. Pick red_ball_1.
17. Drop in room_2.

Then, enter room_4. This way, the condition is met.

But this is getting too long again. It's clear that the optimal plan requires careful sequencing to satisfy all constraints without unnecessary steps.

After several iterations, the optimal plan likely involves:

1. Handle grey_box_1 and blue_door_2 first.
2. Unlock red_door_1 and blue_door_1.
3. Unlock purple_door_1 and be in front of it (goal).
4. Ensure all other constraints are met through strategic object movements.

But time is limited, so I'll proceed to write the final answer based on the initial plan but condensed to meet all constraints efficiently.
