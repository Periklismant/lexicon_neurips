Let me understand the planning problem.

We need to navigate a 2D gridworld with 4 rooms arranged in a square:
- room_1: north-west
- room_2: south-west
- room_3: north-east
- room_4: south-east

The rooms are connected by 4 doors:
- red_door_1 connects room_1 and room_2
- blue_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3
- blue_door_2 connects room_2 and room_4
- purple_door_1 connects room_3 and room_4

In the rooms, there might be boxes and balls of different colors.

I'll summarize the initial state:
- I am in room_2
- red_ball_1, red_ball_2, yellow_box_1 are in room_1
- yellow_ball_1, grey_box_1 are in room_2
- purple_ball_1, green_box_1 are in room_3
- blue_box_1 is in room_4
- All doors are locked
- I am not holding any object
- I have visited room_2

The goal is to achieve: "There is a door d such that "The following conditions are all true: "d is purple", "room_3 and room_4 are connected via d", "you are in front of d", "d is not locked""

So, I need to stand in front of purple_door_1 (which connects room_3 and room_4) and make sure it's unlocked.

Now, let's go through the constraints:

1. At some point, I need to be in front of blue_door_2.
2. Before being in front of blue_door_2, I need to be holding grey_box_1.
3. blue_door_2 must always remain locked.
4. At some point, I need to be in room_4.
5. Before being in room_4, either yellow_ball_1 must be in room_4 or red_ball_1 must be in room_2.
6. At some point, purple_ball_1 must be in room_1, and yellow_ball_1 must be in room_3.
7. At some point, I need to be in front of purple_door_1.
8. Before being in front of purple_door_1, I need to either be in room_1 or be holding yellow_box_1.
9. At some point, blue_door_1 must be unlocked.
10. At some point, red_ball_2 must be in room_3.

Given these constraints and the goal, let's see how I should plan my actions.

First, let's check constraint 3: "blue_door_2 is locked" must hold in every state. This means I can't unlock blue_door_2, so I can't use it to go from room_2 to room_4 or vice versa. But constraints 1 and 2 say that at some point, I need to be in front of blue_door_2 and before that, I need to be holding grey_box_1. This means I need to pick up grey_box_1, go in front of blue_door_2, but I can't unlock it or pass through it.

Looking at constraint 4 and 5, I need to be in room_4 at some point, and before that, either yellow_ball_1 must be in room_4 or red_ball_1 must be in room_2. Since blue_door_2 must remain locked, the only way to get to room_4 is from room_3 via purple_door_1. And constraint 7 says I need to be in front of purple_door_1, and before that, either be in room_1 or be holding yellow_box_1.

Constraint 6 says that at some point, purple_ball_1 must be in room_1 and yellow_ball_1 must be in room_3. This means I need to move these balls from their initial positions.

Constraint 9 says blue_door_1 must be unlocked at some point, which I'll need to do using the toggle action.

Constraint 10 says red_ball_2 must be in room_3 at some point, which means I need to move it there from room_1.

Let's think about the sequence of actions:

1. I'm in room_2. I'll pick up grey_box_1 first (to satisfy constraint 2).
2. Then, I'll go in front of blue_door_2 (to satisfy constraint 1), but I won't unlock it (due to constraint 3).
3. Next, I need to head towards room_1. I'll unlock red_door_1 and go through it.
4. In room_1, I'll drop grey_box_1 and pick up red_ball_1. I'll then go back to room_2 and drop it there (to satisfy part of constraint 5).
5. I'll go back to room_1, pick up yellow_box_1, and come back to room_2. Then, I'll be holding yellow_box_1 (which will help with constraint 8).
6. I'll go back to room_1 and unlock blue_door_1 (to satisfy constraint 9).
7. I'll go to room_3 via blue_door_1, being in room_1 with yellow_box_1 helps with constraint 8.
8. In room_3, I'll drop yellow_box_1 and pick up purple_ball_1. I'll go back to room_1 via blue_door_1 and drop purple_ball_1 there (to satisfy part of constraint 6).
9. I'll go back to room_2, pick up yellow_ball_1, go to room_1, and then to room_3, and drop yellow_ball_1 there (to satisfy the other part of constraint 6).
10. I'll go back to room_1, pick up red_ball_2, go to room_3, and drop it there (to satisfy constraint 10).
11. I'll unlock purple_door_1 (which is part of the goal) and stand in front of it (to satisfy constraint 7 and the goal).

Wait, I need to redo constraint 5. I need to be in room_4 at some point, and before that, either yellow_ball_1 must be in room_4 or red_ball_1 must be in room_2. Part of my plan ensures red_ball_1 is in room_2, so this constraint is already addressed.

Alright, let's execute this plan:

Initialize: I'm in room_2, and there are yellow_ball_1 and grey_box_1 in the room.

1. `gotoobject grey_box_1 room_2`: Go in front of grey_box_1 in room_2.
2. `pick grey_box_1 room_2`: Pick up grey_box_1.
3. `gotodoor blue_door_2 room_2 room_4`: Go in front of blue_door_2, which connects room_2 and room_4.

Hmm, now I'm in front of blue_door_2 and holding grey_box_1, satisfying constraints 1 and 2. And blue_door_2 remains locked, satisfying constraint 3.

Next, I need to head towards room_1.

4. `gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_1`: Go in front of red_door_1, which connects room_2 and room_1.
5. `toggle red_door_1`: Unlock red_door_1.
6. `gotoroom room_2 room_1 red_door_1`: Go from room_2 to room_1 using red_door_1.

Now, I'm in room_1, and there are red_ball_1, red_ball_2, and yellow_box_1 in the room. I'm still holding grey_box_1.

7. `gotoempty`: Go in front of an empty position in room_1.
8. `drop grey_box_1 room_1`: Drop grey_box_1 in room_1.
9. `gotoobject red_ball_1 room_1`: Go in front of red_ball_1 in room_1.
10. `pick red_ball_1 room_1`: Pick up red_ball_1.
11. `gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_2`: Go in front of red_door_1, which connects room_1 and room_2.
12. `gotoroom room_1 room_2 red_door_1`: Go from room_1 to room_2 using red_door_1.
13. `gotoempty`: Go in front of an empty position in room_2.
14. `drop red_ball_1 room_2`: Drop red_ball_1 in room_2.

I've now satisfied part of constraint 5, having red_ball_1 in room_2.

Next, I'll go back to room_1, pick up yellow_box_1, and come back to room_2.

15. `gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_1`: Go in front of red_door_1.
16. `gotoroom room_2 room_1 red_door_1`: Go from room_2 to room_1 using red_door_1.
17. `gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_1`: Go in front of yellow_box_1 in room_1.
18. `pick yellow_box_1 room_1`: Pick up yellow_box_1.

Now, I'm in room_1 and holding yellow_box_1. Both of these facts help with constraint 8, which says "Before being in front of purple_door_1, I need to either be in room_1 or be holding yellow_box_1."

Next, I'll continue to unlock blue_door_1 and go to room_3.

19. `gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_3`: Go in front of blue_door_1, which connects room_1 and room_3.
20. `toggle blue_door_1`: Unlock blue_door_1, satisfying constraint 9.
21. `gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_1`: Go from room_1 to room_3 using blue_door_1.

Now, I'm in room_3, holding yellow_box_1, and there are purple_ball_1 and green_box_1 in the room.

22. `gotoempty`: Go in front of an empty position in room_3.
23. `drop yellow_box_1 room_3`: Drop yellow_box_1 in room_3.
24. `gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_3`: Go in front of purple_ball_1 in room_3.
25. `pick purple_ball_1 room_3`: Pick up purple_ball_1.
26. `gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_1`: Go in front of blue_door_1, which connects room_3 and room_1.
27. `gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_1`: Go from room_3 to room_1 using blue_door_1.
28. `gotoempty`: Go in front of an empty position in room_1.
29. `drop purple_ball_1 room_1`: Drop purple_ball_1 in room_1.

Now, I've satisfied part of constraint 6, having purple_ball_1 in room_1.

Let's continue to move yellow_ball_1 to room_3 and red_ball_2 to room_3.

30. `gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_2`: Go in front of red_door_1.
31. `gotoroom room_1 room_2 red_door_1`: Go from room_1 to room_2 using red_door_1.
32. `gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2`: Go in front of yellow_ball_1 in room_2.
33. `pick yellow_ball_1 room_2`: Pick up yellow_ball_1.
34. `gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_1`: Go in front of red_door_1.
35. `gotoroom room_2 room_1 red_door_1`: Go from room_2 to room_1 using red_door_1.
36. `gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_3`: Go in front of blue_door_1.
37. `gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_1`: Go from room_1 to room_3 using blue_door_1.
38. `gotoempty`: Go in front of an empty position in room_3.
39. `drop yellow_ball_1 room_3`: Drop yellow_ball_1 in room_3.

Now, I've also satisfied the other part of constraint 6, having yellow_ball_1 in room_3.

40. `gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_1`: Go in front of blue_door_1.
41. `gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_1`: Go from room_3 to room_1 using blue_door_1.
42. `gotoobject red_ball_2 room_1`: Go in front of red_ball_2 in room_1.
43. `pick red_ball_2 room_1`: Pick up red_ball_2.
44. `gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_3`: Go in front of blue_door_1.
45. `gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_1`: Go from room_1 to room_3 using blue_door_1.
46. `gotoempty`: Go in front of an empty position in room_3.
47. `drop red_ball_2 room_3`: Drop red_ball_2 in room_3, satisfying constraint 10.

Now, I'll unlock purple_door_1 and stand in front of it to satisfy constraint 7 and the goal.

48. `gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_4`: Go in front of purple_door_1, which connects room_3 and room_4.
49. `toggle purple_door_1`: Unlock purple_door_1.

I've now achieved the goal and satisfied all constraints. Let's double-check:

1. At some point, I was in front of blue_door_2 (Step 3).
2. Before being in front of blue_door_2, I was holding grey_box_1 (Step 2).
3. blue_door_2 remained locked throughout.
4. At some point, I still need to be in room_4. Let's fix that by adding:
   50. `gotoroom room_3 room_4 purple_door_1`: Go from room_3 to room_4 using purple_door_1.
   51. `gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_3`: Go in front of purple_door_1, which connects room_4 and room_3.
   52. `gotoroom room_4 room_3 purple_door_1`: Go from room_4 to room_3 using purple_door_1.
   53. `gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_4`: Go in front of purple_door_1, which connects room_3 and room_4.

Wait, if my goal is to make sure I'm in front of purple_door_1 and it's unlocked, I can just stop at Step 49. I've already achieved the goal, and based on the constraints, I don't necessarily need to go to room_4 for any reason other than satisfying constraint 4. Let me check the wording carefully: "The following expression must hold in at least one state: you are in room_4". So, I do need to actually go into room_4. Let me revise:

48. `gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_4`: Go in front of purple_door_1, which connects room_3 and room_4.
49. `toggle purple_door_1`: Unlock purple_door_1.
50. `gotoroom room_3 room_4 purple_door_1`: Go from room_3 to room_4 using purple_door_1, satisfying constraint 4.
51. `gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_3`: Go in front of purple_door_1, which connects room_4 and room_3.

There's another constraint to check that I missed: "Before being in room_4, either yellow_ball_1 must be in room_4 or red_ball_1 must be in room_2." I did put red_ball_1 in room_2, so this constraint is satisfied.

5. Before being in room_4, red_ball_1 was in room_2 (I put it there in steps 13 and 14).
6. At some point, purple_ball_1 was in room_1 and yellow_ball_1 was in room_3 (Satisfied by steps 29 and 39).
7. I was in front of purple_door_1 (Steps 48 and 51).
8. Before being in front of purple_door_1, I was in room_1 (Step 19 onwards, including at steps 21-27).
9. blue_door_1 was unlocked (Step 20).
10. red_ball_2 was in room_3 (Step 47).

All constraints are satisfied.

Let me sanity-check the sequence one more time:

Initialize: I'm in room_2, and there are yellow_ball_1 and grey_box_1 in the room.

1. `gotoobject grey_box_1 room_2`: Go in front of grey_box_1 in room_2.
2. `pick grey_box_1 room_2`: Pick up grey_box_1.
3. `gotodoor blue_door_2 room_2 room_4`: Go in front of blue_door_2, which connects room_2 and room_4.

5. `toggle red_door_1`: Unlock red_door_1.
6. `gotoroom room_2 room_1 red_door_1`: Go from room_2 to room_1 using red_door_1.
7. `gotoempty`: Go in front of an empty position in room_1.

27. `gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_1`: Go from room_3 to room_1 using blue_door_1.
28. `gotoempty`: Go in front of an empty position in room_1.
29. `drop purple_ball_1 room_1`: Drop purple_ball_1 in room_1.
30. `gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_2`: Go in front of red_door_1.
31. `gotoroom room_1 room_2 red_door_1`: Go from room_1 to room_2 using red_door_1.
32. `gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2`: Go in front of yellow_ball_1 in room_2.
33. `pick yellow_ball_1 room_2`: Pick up yellow_ball_1.
34. `gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_1`: Go in front of red_door_1.
35. `gotoroom room_2 room_1 red_door_1`: Go from room_2 to room_1 using red_door_1.
36. `gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_3`: Go in front of blue_door_1.
37. `gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_1`: Go from room_1 to room_3 using blue_door_1.
38. `gotoempty`: Go in front of an empty position in room_3.
39. `drop yellow_ball_1 room_3`: Drop yellow_ball_1 in room_3.
40. `gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_1`: Go in front of blue_door_1.
41. `gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_1`: Go from room_3 to room_1 using blue_door_1.
42. `gotoobject red_ball_2 room_1`: Go in front of red_ball_2 in room_1.
43. `pick red_ball_2 room_1`: Pick up red_ball_2.
44. `gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_3`: Go in front of blue_door_1.
45. `gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_1`: Go from room_1 to room_3 using blue_door_1.
46. `gotoempty`: Go in front of an empty position in room_3.
47. `drop red_ball_2 room_3`: Drop red_ball_2 in room_3, satisfying constraint 10.
48. `gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_4`: Go in front of purple_door_1, which connects room_3 and room_4.
49. `toggle purple_door_1`: Unlock purple_door_1.
50. `gotoroom room_3 room_4 purple_door_1`: Go from room_3 to room_4 using purple_door_1, satisfying constraint 4.
51. `gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_3`: Go in front of purple_door_1, which connects room_4 and room_3.

The sequence looks correct, and the goal has been achieved. Let me just double-check the state at step 51, which is the final state:

- I am in room_4 (from step 50)
- I am in front of purple_door_1 (from step 51)
- purple_door_1 is unlocked (from step 49)

These bring about the goal specified in the problem:
"There is a door d such that "The following conditions are all true: "d is purple", "room_3 and room_4 are connected via d", "you are in front of d", "d is not locked""

Actually, I don't think step 51 works since I can't move to room_3 via the purple door while I'm already in room_4. This step was mean to just position me in front of the door from the room_4 side.

Let me correct this:

50. `gotoroom room_3 room_4 purple_door_1`: Go from room_3 to room_4 using purple_door_1, satisfying constraint 4.
51. `gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_3`: Go in front of purple_door_1 from the room_4 side.

So the final state is:
- I am in room_4 (from step 50)
- I am in front of purple_door_1 (from step 51)
- purple_door_1 is unlocked (from step 49)

This matches the goal. Actually, I think there's an issue with the sequence. After achieving the goal, I'm making it to room_4. But actually I might not maintain the goal that I need to be in front of the purple door. Let me re-read the goal again:

The goal is to bring about the following situation:
	"There is a door d such that "The following conditions are all true: "d is purple", "room_3 and room_4 are connected via d", "you are in front of d", "d is not locked"""

So I need to be in front of the purple door, and the door needs to be unlocked. But it needs to be in this state at the end of the plan.

Let's re-sequence the last few steps:

48. `gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_4`: Go in front of purple_door_1, which connects room_3 and room_4.
49. `toggle purple_door_1`: Unlock purple_door_1.
50. `gotoroom room_3 room_4 purple_door_1`: Go from room_3 to room_4 using purple_door_1, satisfying constraint 4.
51. `gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_3`: Go in front of purple_door_1 from the room_4 side.

So I've satisfied the constraint that "at some point you are in room_4", but the goal requires me to be in front of the purple door. So I should end with the state achieved by step 51, where I'm in front of the purple door from the room_4 side.

Actually, since it seems that the most efficient way to achieve all constraints and the goal is to end the plan at step 51, let's just go with that. But let me trace through the plan once more to make sure it's all valid and optimal.

Let's step through the plan again and check:

Is step 50 really necessary? Let's check that constraint: "The following expression must hold in at least one state: you are in room_4"
Yes, this requires us to actually be in room_4 at some point in our plan, so step 50 is indeed necessary.

OK, this is the final plan!

We've completed all of the constraints:
1. At some point, I was in front of blue_door_2 (Step 3).
2. Before being in front of blue_door_2, I was holding grey_box_1 (Step 2).
3. blue_door_2 remained locked throughout.
4. At some point, I was in room_4 (Step 50).
5. Before being in room_4, red_ball_1 was in room_2 (Steps 13 and 14).
6. At some point, purple_ball_1 was in room_1 and yellow_ball_1 was in room_3 (Steps 29 and 39).
7. I was in front of purple_door_1 (Steps 48 and 51).
8. Before being in front of purple_door_1, I was in room_1 (various earlier steps).
9. blue_door_1 was unlocked (Step 20).
10. red_ball_2 was in room_3 (Step 47).

At the final state, I'm in room_4, in front of the unlocked purple_door_1, which connects room_3 and room_4, which precisely matches the goal:
"There is a door d such that "The following conditions are all true: "d is purple", "room_3 and room_4 are connected via d", "you are in front of d", "d is not locked"""
