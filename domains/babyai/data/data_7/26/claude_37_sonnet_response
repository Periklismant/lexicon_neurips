Let's break down this planning problem and think through the constraints.

World Description:
- 4 rooms arranged in a square
- Room 1: NW, Room 2: SW, Room 3: NE, Room 4: SE
- Doors connect Room1-Room2, Room1-Room3, Room2-Room4, Room3-Room4
- Objects can be boxes or balls, each with a color
- Each door has a color
- Various actions we can take: goto, pick, drop, toggle

Initial state:
- We are in room_1
- red_box_1 and yellow_box_1 are in room_1
- grey_ball_1 and grey_ball_2 are in room_2
- grey_ball_3 is in room_3
- green_box_1, yellow_ball_1, and green_ball_1 are in room_4
- All doors are locked
- We're not holding anything
- blue_door_1 connects room_1 and room_2
- red_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3
- purple_door_1 connects room_2 and room_4
- blue_door_2 connects room_3 and room_4

Goal:
- We are in room_2
- We are in front of some grey ball in room_2

Constraints:
1. We must hold green_box_1 at some point
2. blue_door_1 must always be locked
3. We must be in front of blue_door_1 at some point
4. If we're in front of blue_door_1, we must hold yellow_box_1 at that point or later
5. We must hold grey_ball_2 at some point
6. We must hold grey_ball_1 at some point
7. We must be in front of grey_ball_1 at some point
8. Before we're in front of grey_ball_1, we must have held yellow_box_1
9. We must either be in front of red_door_1 or hold grey_ball_1 at some point

These constraints significantly shape our solution.

Let's plan:

1. First, I need to understand how to satisfy these constraints.
2. Since blue_door_1 must always be locked (constraint 2), and blue_door_1 connects room_1 and room_2, I can't use that door to get to room_2 (which is part of the goal).
3. I need to find an alternate path to room_2.
4. I must hold green_box_1 (constraint 1), which is initially in room_4.
5. I must also be in front of blue_door_1 (constraint 3) and when I do that, I must hold yellow_box_1 then or later (constraint 4).
6. I must also hold grey_ball_2 and grey_ball_1 (constraints 5 and 6), which are initially in room_2.
7. I must be in front of grey_ball_1 (constraint 7), and before that, I must have held yellow_box_1 (constraint 8).
8. I must also either be in front of red_door_1 or hold grey_ball_1 (constraint 9).

Let's map out a possible path:
- Start in room_1
- Go to room_3 via red_door_1 (need to unlock it first)
- Go to room_4 via blue_door_2 (need to unlock it first)
- Pick up green_box_1 (satisfying constraint 1)
- Drop green_box_1 as we don't need it anymore
- Go back to room_3 via blue_door_2
- Go back to room_1 via red_door_1
- Pick up yellow_box_1 (needed for constraint 8)
- Stand in front of blue_door_1 (satisfying constraint 3 and 4)
- Go to room_3 via red_door_1
- Go to room_4 via blue_door_2
- Go to room_2 via purple_door_1 (need to unlock it first)
- Drop yellow_box_1 as we don't need it anymore
- Go to grey_ball_1 (satisfying part of constraint 7)
- Pick up grey_ball_1 (satisfying constraint 6)
- Drop grey_ball_1 as we don't need it anymore
- Go to grey_ball_2
- Pick up grey_ball_2 (satisfying constraint 5)
- Drop grey_ball_2
- Go in front of grey_ball_1 or grey_ball_2 (to meet the goal)

Let's refine the plan with specific actions:

1. gotoobject red_door_1 room_1 (to unlock it)
2. toggle red_door_1 (unlock)
3. gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1
4. gotoobject blue_door_2 room_3 (to unlock it)
5. toggle blue_door_2 (unlock)
6. gotoroom room_3 room_4 blue_door_2
7. gotoobject green_box_1 room_4
8. pick green_box_1 room_4 (satisfying constraint 1)
9. gotoempty
10. drop green_box_1 room_4
11. gotoobject blue_door_2 room_4
12. gotoroom room_4 room_3 blue_door_2
13. gotoobject red_door_1 room_3
14. gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1
15. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_1
16. pick yellow_box_1 room_1 (needed for constraint 8)
17. gotoobject blue_door_1 room_1 (satisfying constraint 3 and setting up constraint 4)
18. gotoobject red_door_1 room_1
19. gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1
20. gotoobject blue_door_2 room_3
21. gotoroom room_3 room_4 blue_door_2
22. gotoobject purple_door_1 room_4 (to unlock it)
23. toggle purple_door_1 (unlock)
24. gotoroom room_4 room_2 purple_door_1
25. gotoempty
26. drop yellow_box_1 room_2 (satisfying constraint 4)
27. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_2
28. pick grey_ball_1 room_2 (satisfying constraint 6 and 9)
29. gotoempty
30. drop grey_ball_1 room_2
31. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_2 (satisfying constraint 7 and the goal)

Wait, I think I may have some issues with the plan. Let's double-check:

1. Constraint 1: Hold green_box_1 at some point - Satisfied at step 8.
2. Constraint 2: blue_door_1 must always be locked - This is satisfied as we never toggle blue_door_1.
3. Constraint 3: Be in front of blue_door_1 at some point - Satisfied at step 17.
4. Constraint 4: If in front of blue_door_1, must hold yellow_box_1 then or later - Satisfied as we hold yellow_box_1 from step 16 through step 26.
5. Constraint 5: Hold grey_ball_2 at some point - Not satisfied yet, need to add this.
6. Constraint 6: Hold grey_ball_1 at some point - Satisfied at step 28.
7. Constraint 7: Be in front of grey_ball_1 at some point - Satisfied at step 27 and 31.
8. Constraint 8: Before in front of grey_ball_1, must have held yellow_box_1 - Satisfied as we hold yellow_box_1 from step 16 through step 26, which is before step 27.
9. Constraint 9: Either be in front of red_door_1 or hold grey_ball_1 - Satisfied at steps 1, 13, 18, 28.

The main issue is constraint 5 - we need to hold grey_ball_2 at some point. Let's update the plan:

1. gotoobject red_door_1 room_1 (to unlock it)
2. toggle red_door_1 (unlock)
3. gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1
4. gotoobject blue_door_2 room_3 (to unlock it)
5. toggle blue_door_2 (unlock)
6. gotoroom room_3 room_4 blue_door_2
7. gotoobject green_box_1 room_4
8. pick green_box_1 room_4 (satisfying constraint 1)
9. gotoempty
10. drop green_box_1 room_4
11. gotoobject blue_door_2 room_4
12. gotoroom room_4 room_3 blue_door_2
13. gotoobject red_door_1 room_3
14. gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1
15. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_1
16. pick yellow_box_1 room_1 (needed for constraint 8)
17. gotoobject blue_door_1 room_1 (satisfying constraint 3 and setting up constraint 4)
18. gotoobject red_door_1 room_1
19. gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1
20. gotoobject blue_door_2 room_3
21. gotoroom room_3 room_4 blue_door_2
22. gotoobject purple_door_1 room_4 (to unlock it)
23. toggle purple_door_1 (unlock)
24. gotoroom room_4 room_2 purple_door_1
25. gotoempty
26. drop yellow_box_1 room_2 (satisfying constraint 4)
27. gotoobject grey_ball_2 room_2
28. pick grey_ball_2 room_2 (satisfying constraint 5)
29. gotoempty
30. drop grey_ball_2 room_2
31. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_2
32. pick grey_ball_1 room_2 (satisfying constraint 6 and 9)
33. gotoempty
34. drop grey_ball_1 room_2
35. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_2 (satisfying constraint 7 and the goal)

Hmm, I realize I still have a logical issue: after picking up grey_ball_2, I say "gotoempty" and drop it, but I need to be in front of an empty spot to drop it. Let me be more precise with the actions:

1. gotoobject red_door_1 room_1 (to unlock it)
2. toggle red_door_1 (unlock)
3. gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1
4. gotoobject blue_door_2 room_3 (to unlock it)
5. toggle blue_door_2 (unlock)
6. gotoroom room_3 room_4 blue_door_2
7. gotoobject green_box_1 room_4
8. pick green_box_1 room_4 (satisfying constraint 1)
9. gotoempty
10. drop green_box_1 room_4
11. gotoobject blue_door_2 room_4
12. gotoroom room_4 room_3 blue_door_2
13. gotoobject red_door_1 room_3
14. gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1
15. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_1
16. pick yellow_box_1 room_1 (needed for constraint 8)
17. gotoobject blue_door_1 room_1 (satisfying constraint 3 and setting up constraint 4)
18. gotoobject red_door_1 room_1
19. gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1
20. gotoobject blue_door_2 room_3
21. gotoroom room_3 room_4 blue_door_2
22. gotoobject purple_door_1 room_4 (to unlock it)
23. toggle purple_door_1 (unlock)
24. gotoroom room_4 room_2 purple_door_1
25. gotoempty
26. drop yellow_box_1 room_2 (satisfying constraint 4)
27. gotoobject grey_ball_2 room_2
28. pick grey_ball_2 room_2 (satisfying constraint 5)
29. gotoempty
30. drop grey_ball_2 room_2
31. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_2
32. pick grey_ball_1 room_2 (satisfying constraint 6 and 9)
33. gotoempty
34. drop grey_ball_1 room_2
35. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_2 (satisfying constraint 7 and the goal)

I've reviewed this plan again and I think it meets all requirements. We:
- Hold green_box_1 at step 8
- Never unlock blue_door_1
- Stand in front of blue_door_1 at step 17
- Hold yellow_box_1 from steps 16-26, which covers step 17
- Hold grey_ball_2 at step 28
- Hold grey_ball_1 at step 32
- Stand in front of grey_ball_1 at steps 31 and 35
- Before standing in front of grey_ball_1, we held yellow_box_1
- Stand in front of red_door_1 at steps 1, 13, 18

And the goal is achieved at step 35, where we're in room_2 and in front of grey_ball_1 (which is grey).

However, let me double-check if I'm properly understanding the "gotoempty" action. I interpreted it as "go to an empty position in the current room," which might be used before dropping an object.

Let me review the task description again:

"gotoempty": Go in front of an empty position of the room, which does not contain any object.

The effects of "gotoempty" are:
(i) if you were in front of some object or door x0, then you are no longer in front of x0 and
(ii) you are in front of an empty position.

So "gotoempty" does allow me to go to an empty position in the room. This seems right.

The effects of "drop" are:
(i) you are no longer carrying x,
(ii) you are in front of x,
(iii) your hands are empty, and
(iv) object x is situated in the room you are currently in.

So after dropping an object, you are in front of it, not at an empty position anymore. This makes sense.

I think my plan is correct, but let me check one more time:

1. gotoobject red_door_1 room_1 (to unlock it)
2. toggle red_door_1 (unlock)
3. gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1
4. gotoobject blue_door_2 room_3 (to unlock it)
5. toggle blue_door_2 (unlock)
6. gotoroom room_3 room_4 blue_door_2
7. gotoobject green_box_1 room_4
8. pick green_box_1 room_4 (satisfying constraint 1)
9. gotoempty
10. drop green_box_1 room_4
11. gotoobject blue_door_2 room_4
12. gotoroom room_4 room_3 blue_door_2
13. gotoobject red_door_1 room_3
14. gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1
15. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_1
16. pick yellow_box_1 room_1 (needed for constraint 8)
17. gotoobject blue_door_1 room_1 (satisfying constraint 3 and setting up constraint 4)
18. gotoobject red_door_1 room_1
19. gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1
20. gotoobject blue_door_2 room_3
21. gotoroom room_3 room_4 blue_door_2
22. gotoobject purple_door_1 room_4 (to unlock it)
23. toggle purple_door_1 (unlock)
24. gotoroom room_4 room_2 purple_door_1
25. gotoempty
26. drop yellow_box_1 room_2 (satisfying constraint 4)
27. gotoobject grey_ball_2 room_2
28. pick grey_ball_2 room_2 (satisfying constraint 5)
29. gotoempty
30. drop grey_ball_2 room_2
31. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_2
32. pick grey_ball_1 room_2 (satisfying constraint 6 and 9)
33. gotoempty
34. drop grey_ball_1 room_2
35. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_2 (satisfying constraint 7 and the goal)

The plan satisfies all constraints and achieves the goal. The final state has us in room_2, standing in front of grey_ball_1.

Let me see if there's any optimization I can make to shorten the plan...

I'm not sure if there's a significantly shorter path given all the constraints. Let me double-check a few things:

1. Do I need to pick up both grey_ball_1 and grey_ball_2? Yes, due to constraints 5 and 6.
2. Do I need to hold green_box_1? Yes, due to constraint 1.
3. Can I use blue_door_1? No, due to constraint 2.
4. Do I need to stand in front of blue_door_1? Yes, due to constraint 3.
5. Do I need to hold yellow_box_1? Yes, due to constraints 4 and 8.

These requirements essentially force me to:
- Make a detour to room_4 to pick up green_box_1
- Return to room_1 to pick up yellow_box_1 and stand in front of blue_door_1
- Go to room_2 through an alternate path (through rooms 3 and 4)
- Pick up both grey balls in room_2

I don't see an obvious way to optimize this plan further. I think it's already optimal given the constraints.

Therefore, the final plan is:

```
gotoobject red_door_1 room_1
toggle red_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1
gotoobject blue_door_2 room_3
toggle blue_door_2
gotoroom room_3 room_4 blue_door_2
gotoobject green_box_1 room_4
pick green_box_1 room_4
gotoempty
drop green_box_1 room_4
gotoobject blue_door_2 room_4
gotoroom room_4 room_3 blue_door_2
gotoobject red_door_1 room_3
gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1
gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_1
pick yellow_box_1 room_1
gotoobject blue_door_1 room_1
gotoobject red_door_1 room_1
gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1
gotoobject blue_door_2 room_3
gotoroom room_3 room_4 blue_door_2
gotoobject purple_door_1 room_4
toggle purple_door_1
gotoroom room_4 room_2 purple_door_1
gotoempty
drop yellow_box_1 room_2
gotoobject grey_ball_2 room_2
pick grey_ball_2 room_2
gotoempty
drop grey_ball_2 room_2
gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_2
pick grey_ball_1 room_2
gotoempty
drop grey_ball_1 room_2
gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_2
```

Okay, I think our plan is correct, but now that I look at it, I'm not sure if the goal is fully achieved with the current plan.

The goal is: "There is a ball v such that "The following conditions are all true: "v is grey", "v is in room_2", "you are in room_2", "you are in front of v"""

My plan ends with me in room_2, in front of grey_ball_1, which is a grey ball in room_2. So I believe the goal is achieved.

Let me review my plan one more time:

1. We start in room_1 with yellow_box_1 and red_box_1
2. We navigate to room_4 to pick up green_box_1 (satisfying constraint 1)
3. We return to room_1 to pick up yellow_box_1
4. We stand in front of blue_door_1 while holding yellow_box_1 (satisfying constraints 3 and 4)
5. We navigate to room_2 via room_3 and room_4
6. In room_2, we pick up grey_ball_2 (satisfying constraint 5)
7. We then pick up grey_ball_1 (satisfying constraints 6 and 9)
8. We end up in room_2, in front of grey_ball_1 (satisfying constraint 7 and the goal)
9. At multiple points we're in front of red_door_1 (also satisfying constraint 9)
10. Before standing in front of grey_ball_1, we held yellow_box_1 (satisfying constraint 8)
11. blue_door_1 remains locked throughout (satisfying constraint 2)

This plan satisfies all constraints and achieves the goal. It's 35 steps long, which seems reasonable given the complex set of constraints.

Let me check if I can optimize any further... No, I don't see any obvious optimizations. The plan as it stands is valid and achieves the goal while satisfying all constraints.
