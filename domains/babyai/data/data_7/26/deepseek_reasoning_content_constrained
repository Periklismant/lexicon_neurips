Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. The goal is to end up in room_2 in front of a grey ball that's also in room_2. Plus, there are several constraints to satisfy. Let's break it down step by step.

First, initial state: I'm in room_1. There are two boxes here, red_box_1 and yellow_box_1. The grey balls are in room_2 (grey_ball_1 and grey_ball_2) and room_3 (grey_ball_3). The goal requires a grey ball in room_2, so maybe I need to pick one of those already there. But I need to end up in front of it in room_2. Also, the constraints include holding green_box_1 (which is in room_4), holding grey_ball_1 and grey_ball_2 at some point, being in front of grey_ball_1, and more.

Constraints to remember:
- blue_door_1 must always be locked. So even if I go through it, I can't unlock it. Wait, but the action "toggle" can unlock or lock a door. But the constraint says blue_door_1 must be locked in every state. So I can't toggle it to unlock. So any door that's blue_door_1 must remain locked. Wait, the initial state says blue_door_1 is locked. So I must not toggle it, because toggling would unlock it, violating the constraint. Therefore, blue_door_1 must stay locked. So I can't use blue_door_1 to move between room_1 and room_2. Because "goto room" requires the door to be unlocked. So I can't go through blue_door_1. So how do I get to room_2?

Wait, the doors connecting rooms are blue_door_1 (room_1-room_2), red_door_1 (room_1-room_3), purple_door_1 (room_2-room_4), and blue_door_2 (room_3-room_4). All doors are initially locked. But blue_door_1 must stay locked. So I can't use blue_door_1 to get to room_2. So how else can I get to room_2? Let's see the room connections. From room_1, I can go to room_3 via red_door_1. Then from room_3 to room_4 via blue_door_2. From room_4 to room_2 via purple_door_1. So perhaps a path through room_1 -> room_3 -> room_4 -> room_2.

But first, I need to unlock those doors. Let's check the initial states: all doors are locked. So to go through red_door_1 (connecting room_1 and room_3), I need to unlock it. Similarly for purple_door_1 and blue_door_2. But each toggle action requires being in front of the door, and toggling changes the state. So the plan would involve going to each door, toggling it to unlock, then moving through.

Wait, but the constraint says that blue_door_1 must always be locked. So even if I don't use it, but maybe if I'm near it, I can't toggle it. So blue_door_1 must remain locked. So the initial state has blue_door_1 locked, and we can't toggle it, because that would unlock it, violating the constraint. So that's a critical point. So I must never toggle blue_door_1.

So the path to room_2 must be through other doors. Let's plan the route:

Current location: room_1.

Possible route: room_1 -> room_3 via red_door_1. But red_door_1 is locked. So I need to go to red_door_1, toggle it to unlock. Then go from room_1 to room_3. Then from room_3 to room_4 via blue_door_2 (which is locked initially), so need to toggle blue_door_2. Then from room_4 to room_2 via purple_door_1 (also locked, need to toggle). Then I can reach room_2.

But then, in room_2, I can get the grey balls. Also, the green_box_1 is in room_4. So I need to pick that up at some point to satisfy the constraint that I must hold it at least once. So perhaps during the route to room_4, I can pick up green_box_1.

But let's outline the steps.

First, in room_1, I need to unlock red_door_1.

To toggle red_door_1, I need to be in front of it. So first, goto door red_door_1 in room_1. But to do that, I need to be in room_1 (which I am), and there's no object blocking the position in front of the door. The initial state in room_1 has red_box_1 and yellow_box_1. Are any of these blocking the door? The problem statement says that "the position in front of d in the room you are currently in" must not be blocked. So if there's an object in front of red_door_1 in room_1, then I can't goto door. But initial state has red_box_1 and yellow_box_1 in room_1. Are they blocking the door? The problem doesn't specify, so I assume that unless stated, objects are not blocking doors. So I can proceed.

So actions:

1. gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3
2. toggle red_door_1 (now unlocked)
3. gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1 (now in room_3)
4. Now in room_3. grey_ball_3 is here. But need to go to room_4. So unlock blue_door_2.

In room_3, door blue_door_2 connects to room_4. So:

5. gotodoor blue_door_2 room_3 room_4
6. toggle blue_door_2 (unlock)
7. gotoroom room_3 room_4 blue_door_2 (now in room_4)
8. In room_4: green_box_1, yellow_ball_1, green_ball_1. Need to pick up green_box_1 to satisfy the constraint. But before that, need to go to it.

9. gotoobject green_box_1 room_4
10. pick green_box_1 room_4 (now holding it; this satisfies the first constraint)
But after picking, I need to drop it somewhere? Or can I carry it? Let's see. But the constraint is that "you are holding green_box_1" must hold in at least one state. So as long as I pick it up and hold it at some point, that's satisfied. So maybe after picking, I can drop it later. But maybe I need to carry it for other reasons. Let's see.

Next, need to get to room_2. From room_4, the door to room_2 is purple_door_1. Which is locked. So need to unlock it.

11. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_2
12. toggle purple_door_1 (unlock)
13. gotoroom room_4 room_2 purple_door_1 (now in room_2)

Now in room_2. Here, grey_ball_1 and grey_ball_2 are present. The goal is to be in room_2 in front of a grey ball. Also, constraints: must hold grey_ball_1 and grey_ball_2 at some point, be in front of grey_ball_1, and when in front of grey_ball_1, there must have been a previous state where I held yellow_box_1. Also, when in front of blue_door_1 (which is in room_1 and room_2), I must hold yellow_box_1 now or later. Wait, but blue_door_1 is in room_1 and room_2. But I'm in room_2 now. Let's check the constraints.

Constraints:

- "you are holding green_box_1" at least once: done when I picked it in room_4.

- "blue_door_1 is locked" in every state: since we never toggled it, it remains locked.

- "you are in front of blue_door_1" at least once: So need to go to blue_door_1. But blue_door_1 connects room_1 and room_2. So in room_2, can I go to blue_door_1? Let's see. The preconditions for gotodoor: must be in a room connected by the door, and no object blocking the position in front of the door.

But in room_2, the door blue_door_1 is present. So from room_2, gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1. But in room_2, are there any objects blocking the door? The initial state has grey_ball_1 and grey_ball_2 in room_2. Are they blocking blue_door_1? Not specified, so assuming not. So possible.

But after that, when I'm in front of blue_door_1, the constraint says that I must be holding yellow_box_1 at that state or after. But yellow_box_1 is in room_1. How can I get it? Because blue_door_1 is locked, so I can't go back to room_1 through it. So maybe I need to get yellow_box_1 earlier.

Wait, but the initial state has me in room_1 with yellow_box_1. But to get to room_2 via the other path, I went through room_3 and room_4, but how can I get yellow_box_1? Because yellow_box_1 is in room_1, and after leaving room_1 to room_3, I can't get back to room_1 unless through red_door_1 again. But if I need to get yellow_box_1, I have to go back to room_1, which would require unlocking red_door_1 again (if it's locked again?), but after toggling it once, it's unlocked. Wait, initial state: all doors are locked. After toggling red_door_1, it becomes unlocked. Unless I toggle it again, it remains unlocked. So after step 3, when I go from room_1 to room_3, red_door_1 is unlocked. So if I need to return to room_1 from room_3, I can go through red_door_1 again, since it's unlocked.

But in the current plan, after step 13, I'm in room_2. To get back to room_1, I would have to go through blue_door_1, which is locked. Or from room_2 to room_4 via purple_door_1 (unlocked now), then to room_3 via blue_door_2 (unlocked), then to room_1 via red_door_1 (unlocked). So possible.

But perhaps there's a way to collect yellow_box_1 earlier. Let's think.

Original path:

room_1 -> room_3 -> room_4 -> room_2.

But after step 3, I'm in room_3. Then steps 4-13 take me to room_2. But to get yellow_box_1, which is in room_1, I need to go back. So perhaps after step 3 (in room_3), go back to room_1, pick up yellow_box_1, then proceed.

Wait, but that would add steps. Let me outline:

Alternative path:

1. In room_1, go to red_door_1, unlock it.
2. Go to room_3.
3. Then return to room_1 via red_door_1 (since it's unlocked).
4. Pick up yellow_box_1 in room_1.
5. Then proceed to room_3 again, then room_4, etc.

But this would require more steps, but maybe necessary for the constraint that when in front of blue_door_1, I must be holding yellow_box_1 now or later.

Wait, the constraint says: If you are in front of blue_door_1 in some state s, then you must be holding yellow_box_1 in s or after. So, to satisfy this, if at any point I'm in front of blue_door_1, I need to have yellow_box_1 either at that time or later.

So, perhaps in the plan, when I'm in room_2, I can go to blue_door_1 (room_2 side), which would require being in front of it. But at that point, I need to have yellow_box_1 either then or later.

But yellow_box_1 is in room_1. How can I get it? Unless I have to bring it with me.

But if I first go to room_1, pick up yellow_box_1, then carry it through the path. Let's see:

Alternative plan steps:

Starting in room_1.

1. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_1
2. pick yellow_box_1 room_1 (now holding it)
But wait, the preconditions for pick: I must be in the same room as the object and not holding anything. Initially, I'm not holding anything. So possible.

But then, to proceed, I need to drop it somewhere to do other actions? Because I can't pick up another object while holding it. But maybe I can carry it all the way.

But then, when I go to room_3, I need to have it with me. Let's see:

After picking yellow_box_1, I need to unlock red_door_1. But to toggle red_door_1, I need to be in front of it. But if I'm holding yellow_box_1, can I still toggle? Yes, as long as I'm in front of the door. So:

3. gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3
4. toggle red_door_1 (unlocks)
5. gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1 (now in room_3, holding yellow_box_1)
6. Now in room_3. Proceed to unlock blue_door_2.
7. gotodoor blue_door_2 room_3 room_4
8. toggle blue_door_2 (unlock)
9. gotoroom room_3 room_4 blue_door_2 (now in room_4, still holding yellow_box_1)
10. In room_4, need to pick up green_box_1. But I'm holding yellow_box_1. So I need to drop it first.

11. drop yellow_box_1 room_4 (now in front of it, hands empty)
12. gotoobject green_box_1 room_4
13. pick green_box_1 room_4 (now holding it)
14. Now, proceed to unlock purple_door_1 in room_4.
15. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_2
16. toggle purple_door_1 (unlock)
17. gotoroom room_4 room_2 purple_door_1 (now in room_2, holding green_box_1)
18. Need to drop green_box_1 to pick up grey balls.
19. drop green_box_1 room_2
20. Now, goto grey_ball_1 in room_2 (satisfies the constraint of being in front of it)
21. pick grey_ball_1 (now holding it, satisfying that constraint)
22. Then, perhaps drop it again, then pick up grey_ball_2 to satisfy that constraint.

But wait, the goal is to be in room_2 in front of a grey ball. So after step 20, being in front of grey_ball_1, maybe that's sufficient. But then I need to be holding grey_ball_1 and grey_ball_2 at some point.

But let's see: the constraints require:

- Must hold grey_ball_1 at least once.

- Must hold grey_ball_2 at least once.

- Must be in front of grey_ball_1 at least once.

- When in front of grey_ball_1, there must be an earlier state where I held yellow_box_1.

In this alternative plan, after picking up yellow_box_1 in room_1, then dropping it in room_4 (step 11), the earlier state of holding yellow_box_1 is before being in front of grey_ball_1. So that's good.

But now, when I'm in room_2, after step 20, I'm in front of grey_ball_1. Then I pick it up (step 21). That satisfies holding grey_ball_1. Then, need to hold grey_ball_2. So I can go to it, pick it up, then drop it.

But also, the goal is to be in front of a grey ball in room_2. So after step 20, I'm in front of grey_ball_1. But the goal requires that the final state is in room_2, in front of a grey ball. So maybe the final action is to be in front of either grey_ball_1 or grey_ball_2. But the goal says "there is a ball v such that...", so as long as I'm in front of one of them in room_2, that's okay.

But in the current plan, after step 20, I'm in front of grey_ball_1. Then I pick it up (step 21), which makes me no longer in front of it. So perhaps after dropping it again, I can go back in front of it.

Alternatively, after step 19 (dropping green_box_1 in room_2), I can go to grey_ball_1 (step 20), then stay there without picking it up, which would satisfy the goal. But then I need to have held grey_ball_1 and grey_ball_2 at some point.

Wait, the constraints are that in at least one state, I'm holding grey_ball_1 and in another state holding grey_ball_2. So I need to pick both up at some point.

So steps after 19:

20. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_2 (in front of it, satisfying that constraint)
21. pick grey_ball_1 room_2 (now holding it; satisfies the constraint)
22. drop grey_ball_1 room_2 (now in front of it again)
23. gotoobject grey_ball_2 room_2
24. pick grey_ball_2 room_2 (now holding it)
25. drop grey_ball_2 room_2

Then, the final step is to be in front of a grey ball (either grey_ball_1 or grey_ball_2). So after step 22, I'm in front of grey_ball_1, which could be the final state. But then I have to ensure that I'm in room_2 and in front of v (which is grey_ball_1). Also, the goal requires that "you are in room_2" and "v is in room_2". Since grey_ball_1 is in room_2, that's okay.

But in this case, after step 22, I'm in front of grey_ball_1, which is in room_2, and I'm in room_2. So that would satisfy the goal.

But I also need to check the constraints:

- Must be in front of blue_door_1 at least once. When does that happen? In this alternative plan, not yet. So I need to go to blue_door_1 in room_2.

So after step 17 (in room_2), perhaps before dropping green_box_1, I can go to blue_door_1.

Wait, let's retrace:

After step 17: in room_2, holding green_box_1.

18. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1 (since blue_door_1 connects room_2 and room_1)
19. Now in front of blue_door_1. At this state, the constraint requires that I'm holding yellow_box_1 now or in a future state. But in this plan, I'm holding green_box_1 now, and yellow_box_1 was dropped in room_4. So unless I retrieve it, this constraint would be violated. Because in the state where I'm in front of blue_door_1 (step 18), I'm holding green_box_1, not yellow_box_1. And after that, I don't have yellow_box_1. So this violates the constraint.

So this approach won't work. Hence, the need to have yellow_box_1 when in front of blue_door_1 or later.

In the previous alternative plan where I picked up yellow_box_1 early and carried it until needed:

Original steps:

1. pick yellow_box_1 in room_1.
2. unlock red_door_1, go to room_3.
3. unlock blue_door_2, go to room_4.
4. unlock purple_door_1, go to room_2.
5. Now in room_2, holding yellow_box_1.
6. goto blue_door_1 (room_2 side), which requires being in front of it. Now, since I'm holding yellow_box_1, the constraint is satisfied.

Then proceed to drop yellow_box_1, pick up green_box_1, etc.

But how to carry yellow_box_1 through all these steps. Let's see:

Starting in room_1:

1. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_1
2. pick yellow_box_1 room_1
3. gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3
4. toggle red_door_1 (unlock)
5. gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1 (now in room_3, holding yellow_box_1)
6. gotodoor blue_door_2 room_3 room_4
7. toggle blue_door_2 (unlock)
8. gotoroom room_3 room_4 blue_door_2 (now in room_4, holding yellow_box_1)
9. Now need to pick up green_box_1. So drop yellow_box_1:
   drop yellow_box_1 room_4
10. gotoobject green_box_1 room_4
11. pick green_box_1 room_4 (now holding it)
12. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_2
13. toggle purple_door_1 (unlock)
14. gotoroom room_4 room_2 purple_door_1 (now in room_2, holding green_box_1)
15. drop green_box_1 room_2
16. Now, need to get back to room_4 to retrieve yellow_box_1? But that's time-consuming. Alternatively, after step 9, perhaps carry yellow_box_1 through room_4 to room_2.

Wait, in step 8, I'm in room_4, holding yellow_box_1. But I need to pick up green_box_1. So I have to drop yellow_box_1 first. So steps 8-11 would be:

8. In room_4, holding yellow_box_1.
9. drop yellow_box_1 room_4 (now in front of it)
10. gotoobject green_box_1 room_4
11. pick green_box_1 room_4
12. Now, need to carry green_box_1 to room_2. But then, yellow_box_1 is in room_4. So to get yellow_box_1 back, I have to go back to room_4, which is possible via purple_door_1 (unlocked).

But this seems complicated. Let's think differently.

Alternatively, after step 5 (in room_3, holding yellow_box_1), go back to room_1, drop yellow_box_1, then proceed. But that adds steps.

Alternatively, find a way to have yellow_box_1 with me when I'm in front of blue_door_1.

In room_2, after arriving via purple_door_1, I need to go to blue_door_1's position in room_2. So:

14. gotoroom room_4 room_2 purple_door_1 (now in room_2)
15. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1 (now in front of blue_door_1)
16. At this point, the constraint requires that I hold yellow_box_1 now or later. But I'm not holding it. So I need to have it in my possession.

But if I had carried yellow_box_1 from room_4 to room_2, then I could be holding it here. But how?

Alternative plan:

1. In room_1: pick yellow_box_1, go to room_3, then room_4, carrying yellow_box_1 all the way.

But in room_4, I need to pick up green_box_1. So I have to drop yellow_box_1 first.

But then, after picking green_box_1, can I carry both? No, because you can only hold one object at a time.

So steps:

1. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_1
2. pick yellow_box_1 room_1
3. gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3
4. toggle red_door_1
5. gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1 (in room_3, holding yellow_box_1)
6. gotodoor blue_door_2 room_3 room_4
7. toggle blue_door_2
8. gotoroom room_3 room_4 blue_door_2 (now in room_4, holding yellow_box_1)
9. drop yellow_box_1 room_4
10. gotoobject green_box_1 room_4
11. pick green_box_1 room_4
12. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_2
13. toggle purple_door_1
14. gotoroom room_4 room_2 purple_door_1 (now in room_2, holding green_box_1)
15. drop green_box_1 room_2
16. Now, need to get yellow_box_1 from room_4. So go back to room_4 via purple_door_1 (unlocked)
17. gotoroom room_2 room_4 purple_door_1 (now in room_4)
18. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_4
19. pick yellow_box_1 room_4
20. gotoroom room_4 room_2 purple_door_1 (back to room_2, holding yellow_box_1)
21. Now in room_2, holding yellow_box_1. Then go to blue_door_1:
22. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1 (now in front of blue_door_1, holding yellow_box_1. This satisfies the constraint.)
23. Now, drop yellow_box_1 room_2
24. Now, proceed to handle grey_balls.

But this adds a lot of steps. However, this satisfies the constraint when being in front of blue_door_1 (step 22) while holding yellow_box_1.

Then, after step 23, I can proceed to handle the grey balls:

25. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_2 (in front of it. The constraint requires that before this, I held yellow_box_1. Since I held it in steps 2 and 19-22, this is satisfied.)
26. pick grey_ball_1 room_2 (satisfies holding it)
27. drop grey_ball_1 room_2
28. gotoobject grey_ball_2 room_2
29. pick grey_ball_2 room_2 (satisfies holding it)
30. drop grey_ball_2 room_2

Finally, to be in front of a grey ball in room_2, after step 27 or 30, I can choose to stay in front of either.

But the goal requires that "you are in front of v" where v is a grey ball in room_2. So the final action could be gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_2.

But after step 27, I'm already in front of grey_ball_1 (after dropping it). Wait, when you drop an object, you are in front of it. So after step 27, I'm in front of grey_ball_1 in room_2, which would satisfy the goal. So the final state after step 27 would be:

- In room_2.

- grey_ball_1 is in room_2 (was picked and dropped here).

- I'm in front of grey_ball_1.

So steps up to 27 would achieve the goal. Then steps 28-30 are for satisfying holding grey_ball_2.

But need to check all constraints:

- Hold green_box_1: done in step 11.

- blue_door_1 remains locked: yes, never toggled.

- In front of blue_door_1: step 22.

- When in front of blue_door_1 (step 22), holding yellow_box_1: yes.

- Hold grey_ball_2: step 29.

- Hold grey_ball_1: step 26.

- In front of grey_ball_1: steps 25 and 27.

- When in front of grey_ball_1 (step 25), there must be an earlier state holding yellow_box_1: step 2 and 19-22, which are before step 25.

- The last constraint: at least one of being in front of red_door_1 or holding grey_ball_1. In step 25, I'm holding grey_ball_1 (step 26), so during step 26, I'm holding it, which satisfies that. Also, when I was in front of red_door_1 in step 3, which is part of the plan.

So this seems to satisfy all constraints.

Now, let's count the steps to see if this is optimal. But maybe there's a shorter path. For example, after step 20, when returning to room_2 with yellow_box_1, can we immediately go to blue_door_1, then proceed to handle the grey balls without needing to go back to room_4 again?

Let me try to outline the entire plan step by step:

1. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_1
2. pick yellow_box_1 room_1
3. gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3
4. toggle red_door_1
5. gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1
6. gotodoor blue_door_2 room_3 room_4
7. toggle blue_door_2
8. gotoroom room_3 room_4 blue_door_2
9. drop yellow_box_1 room_4
10. gotoobject green_box_1 room_4
11. pick green_box_1 room_4
12. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_2
13. toggle purple_door_1
14. gotoroom room_4 room_2 purple_door_1
15. drop green_box_1 room_2
16. gotoroom room_2 room_4 purple_door_1
17. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_4
18. pick yellow_box_1 room_4
19. gotoroom room_4 room_2 purple_door_1
20. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1
21. drop yellow_box_1 room_2
22. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_2
23. pick grey_ball_1 room_2
24. drop grey_ball_1 room_2
25. gotoobject grey_ball_2 room_2
26. pick grey_ball_2 room_2
27. drop grey_ball_2 room_2
28. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_2

Wait, but this is quite lengthy. Can we optimize?

Alternative approach: After step 14 (in room_2, holding green_box_1), instead of dropping it and going back to room_4 to get yellow_box_1, can we first go to blue_door_1 while holding green_box_1, then after toggling, drop green_box_1 and proceed. But then, when in front of blue_door_1, we're holding green_box_1, not yellow_box_1, which violates the constraint. So no.

Alternative idea: When in room_4, after picking green_box_1 (step 11), carry it to room_2, drop it, then return to room_4 to get yellow_box_1, carry it to room_2, then go to blue_door_1 while holding yellow_box_1.

But that's still many steps.

Another angle: Maybe after step 5 (in room_3, holding yellow_box_1), instead of proceeding to room_4, go back to room_1 and drop yellow_box_1 there. Then proceed to room_3, room_4, etc., and later come back to room_1 to pick it up again. But this adds steps.

Alternatively, after step 5 (in room_3, holding yellow_box_1), go to room_4, drop yellow_box_1, then unlock doors, go to room_2, and later retrieve yellow_box_1.

But perhaps there's a smarter way. Let's think: The key constraints are:

- Must be in front of blue_door_1 at least once, and when you are, you must hold yellow_box_1 then or later.

So if I can be in front of blue_door_1 while holding yellow_box_1, that satisfies it. Or, if I'm in front of blue_door_1 and later hold yellow_box_1.

But in the plan where I drop yellow_box_1 in room_4, then later pick it up again and carry it to room_2, I can go to blue_door_1 after that.

But this requires extra steps to retrieve it.

Alternatively, maybe I can pick up yellow_box_1 in room_1, carry it all the way to room_2, but this would require unlocking doors while holding it, which is possible.

Let's try:

1. In room_1:

   a. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_1
   b. pick yellow_box_1 room_1

2. Unlock red_door_1:

   c. gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3
   d. toggle red_door_1
   e. gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1 (now in room_3, holding yellow_box_1)

3. Unlock blue_door_2:

   f. gotodoor blue_door_2 room_3 room_4
   g. toggle blue_door_2
   h. gotoroom room_3 room_4 blue_door_2 (now in room_4, holding yellow_box_1)

4. Unlock purple_door_1:

   i. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_2
   j. toggle purple_door_1
   k. gotoroom room_4 room_2 purple_door_1 (now in room_2, holding yellow_box_1)

5. Now, in room_2, holding yellow_box_1. Need to pick up green_box_1, which is in room_4. But I'm holding yellow_box_1. So:

   l. drop yellow_box_1 room_2
   m. gotoroom room_2 room_4 purple_door_1
   n. gotoobject green_box_1 room_4
   o. pick green_box_1 room_4
   p. gotoroom room_4 room_2 purple_door_1 (now in room_2, holding green_box_1)
   q. drop green_box_1 room_2
   r. Now, need to pick up yellow_box_1 again:

   s. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_2
   t. pick yellow_box_1 room_2

6. Now, go to blue_door_1:

   u. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1 (now in front of it, holding yellow_box_1)

7. Proceed to handle grey balls:

   v. drop yellow_box_1 room_2
   w. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_2
   x. pick grey_ball_1 room_2
   y. drop grey_ball_1 room_2
   z. gotoobject grey_ball_2 room_2
   aa. pick grey_ball_2 room_2
   ab. drop grey_ball_2 room_2
   ac. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_2 (final state)

This plan satisfies all constraints:

- green_box_1 is picked in step o.

- blue_door_1 remains locked (never toggled).

- in front of blue_door_1 in step u.

- in step u, holding yellow_box_1.

- holding grey_ball_1 in x and grey_ball_2 in aa.

- in front of grey_ball_1 in steps w and y.

- when in front of grey_ball_1 (step w), previous steps include holding yellow_box_1 in steps b, t.

- the last constraint: either in front of red_door_1 (step c) or holding grey_ball_1 (steps x, y, etc.)

But this plan is also quite long. Is there a shorter way?

Let me think again. Maybe after unlocking the doors, instead of carrying yellow_box_1 all the way, find a way to use the grey_ball_3 in room_3.

But the goal requires a grey ball in room_2, so moving grey_ball_3 to room_2 might be an option, but it's not necessary since room_2 already has two grey balls.

Alternatively, perhaps the shortest path is to go to room_2 via the long route, pick up the balls there, and handle the constraints.

But the main challenge is the constraint related to blue_door_1 and yellow_box_1.

Another Idea: Instead of carrying yellow_box_1 all the way to room_2, maybe use the fact that after dropping it in room_4, I can go back to room_1 via room_3 to pick it up again.

But this would add steps. Let's see:

Original path to room_2:

room_1 -> room_3 -> room_4 -> room_2.

Then, after reaching room_2, need to go back to room_1 to get yellow_box_1.

But how? Since blue_door_1 is locked, I can't go directly. So path back would be room_2 -> room_4 -> room_3 -> room_1.

But that's possible if the doors are unlocked.

So steps:

After arriving in room_2:

15. gotoroom room_2 room_4 purple_door_1 (unlocked)
16. gotoroom room_4 room_3 blue_door_2 (unlocked)
17. gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1 (unlocked)
18. Now in room_1. Pick up yellow_box_1.
19. Go back to room_2 via the same path.

But this adds many steps. But maybe it's necessary.

Alternatively, after reaching room_2, I can go to blue_door_1's position (room_2 side), and since I'm not holding yellow_box_1, I must hold it later. But yellow_box_1 is in room_1, so I need to find a way to get it.

But this seems impossible without unlocking blue_door_1, which is forbidden.

So perhaps the only way is to carry yellow_box_1 through the entire journey.

But this requires dropping it when necessary and retrieving it.

But how to minimize steps.

Another Idea: When in room_4, after dropping yellow_box_1, pick up green_box_1, go to room_2, drop it, then return to room_4 to get yellow_box_1, bring it to room_2, then proceed.

This would be:

Steps after room_4:

14. in room_4, after dropping yellow_box_1 (step 9), pick green_box_1 (step 10-11), go to room_2 (step 12-14), drop green_box_1 (step 15), return to room_4 (step 16), pick yellow_box_1 (step 17-18), go back to room_2 (step 19), then go to blue_door_1 (step 20), then drop yellow_box_1 (step 21), and handle grey balls.

This seems to be the required path.

But this plan is quite long, but perhaps it's the shortest possible given the constraints.

Now, let's try to outline the plan with the minimum steps:

1. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_1
2. pick yellow_box_1 room_1
3. gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3
4. toggle red_door_1
5. gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1
6. gotodoor blue_door_2 room_3 room_4
7. toggle blue_door_2
8. gotoroom room_3 room_4 blue_door_2
9. drop yellow_box_1 room_4
10. gotoobject green_box_1 room_4
11. pick green_box_1 room_4
12. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_2
13. toggle purple_door_1
14. gotoroom room_4 room_2 purple_door_1
15. drop green_box_1 room_2
16. gotoroom room_2 room_4 purple_door_1
17. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_4
18. pick yellow_box_1 room_4
19. gotoroom room_4 room_2 purple_door_1
20. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1
21. drop yellow_box_1 room_2
22. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_2
23. pick grey_ball_1 room_2
24. drop grey_ball_1 room_2
25. gotoobject grey_ball_2 room_2
26. pick grey_ball_2 room_2
27. drop grey_ball_2 room_2
28. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_2

This plan has 28 steps. But is there a way to shorten it?

For example, after step 19, I'm in room_2 holding yellow_box_1. Instead of dropping it (step 21), maybe go directly to blue_door_1 while holding it, then drop it after:

20. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1 (now in front of blue_door_1, holding yellow_box_1)
21. drop yellow_box_1 room_2 (but in front of blue_door_1, which is a door, so when you drop, you are in front of the object. So after dropping, you're in front of yellow_box_1, not the door. So need to adjust.)

Alternatively, after step 20 (in front of blue_door_1), drop yellow_box_1 there. Then, you're in front of yellow_box_1, not the door. So the constraint for being in front of blue_door_1 is satisfied at step 20, and holding yellow_box_1 at that state.

So steps 20-21 would be:

20. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1
21. drop yellow_box_1 room_2 (now in front of yellow_box_1, not the door)

But then, after dropping, you're no longer in front of blue_door_1. But the constraint requires that at some state, you're in front of blue_door_1, which is satisfied at step 20.

So after step 20, you've satisfied that constraint.

Then, proceed to handle the grey balls:

22. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_2
23. pick grey_ball_1 room_2
24. drop grey_ball_1 room_2 (now in front of it)
25. gotoobject grey_ball_2 room_2
26. pick grey_ball_2 room_2
27. drop grey_ball_2 room_2
28. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_2

This reduces the steps from 28 to 28? Not really. But perhaps combining some steps.

Alternatively, after step 20 (in front of blue_door_1), drop yellow_box_1 there, then goto grey_ball_1.

So steps:

20. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1
21. drop yellow_box_1 room_2 (now in front of yellow_box_1)
22. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_2
23. pick grey_ball_1 room_2
24. drop grey_ball_1 room_2
25. gotoobject grey_ball_2 room_2
26. pick grey_ball_2 room_2
27. drop grey_ball_2 room_2
28. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_2

This is still 28 steps.

Alternatively, after dropping yellow_box_1 in room_2 (step 21), you're in front of it. So if you can use that position for something else. But I think this is as short as it gets.

But wait, the initial plan may have unnecessary steps. For example, after step 15 (dropping green_box_1 in room_2), steps 16-19 are going back to room_4 to get yellow_box_1. But maybe there's a way to avoid that.

Wait, when you're in room_2 after step 14, you can go to blue_door_1 first, but then you need to have yellow_box_1. But it's in room_4. So you need to retrieve it.

Alternatively, perhaps after step 14 (in room_2, holding green_box_1), drop it, then immediately go back to room_4 to get yellow_box_1.

But this would require:

15. drop green_box_1 room_2
16. gotoroom room_2 room_4 purple_door_1
17. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_4
18. pick yellow_box_1 room_4
19. gotoroom room_4 room_2 purple_door_1 (now in room_2, holding yellow_box_1)
20. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1 (now in front of it)
21. drop yellow_box_1 room_2
22. proceed to grey_ball_1.

This is similar to before.

But is there a way to combine steps?

For instance, when in room_4 after step 8, can I pick up green_box_1 without dropping yellow_box_1? No, because you can only hold one object at a time.

So the steps are necessary.

Given all this, the plan must include these steps to satisfy all constraints. Therefore, the optimal plan is as outlined.
