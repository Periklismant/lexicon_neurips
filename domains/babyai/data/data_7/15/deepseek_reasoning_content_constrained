Okay, let's try to figure out how to solve this planning problem. The goal is to get to a red door connecting room_3 and room_4 (which would be red_door_2), be in front of it, and have it unlocked. Plus, there are a bunch of constraints to satisfy. Let me start by breaking down the problem.

First, the initial state. The agent is in room_2. The doors are all locked initially: grey_door_1 (between room_1 and 2), green_door_1 (between 1 and 3), red_door_1 (between 2 and 4), and red_door_2 (between 3 and 4). So, moving between rooms requires unlocking doors. But some constraints say that red_door_1 must stay locked throughout. So we can't use red_door_1 to go from room_2 to 4. That complicates things. So how do we get to room_4? Maybe through room_3 and then via red_door_2?

The constraints include that we must be in room_4 at least once. Also, whenever we are in room_4, we must have held yellow_box_1 before. So we need to pick up yellow_box_1, which is in room_3. Then, maybe carry it to room_4. Also, blue_box_1 must be in room_4 at some point. Blue_box_1 is initially in room_1, so we need to move it there. But moving boxes requires picking them up, which requires being in the same room. So maybe the agent needs to go to room_1, pick up blue_box_1, carry it to room_4. But how to get to room_1 from room_2? The door between 1 and 2 is grey_door_1, which is locked. So we need to unlock it. But wait, the preconditions for toggle: you can only toggle a door if you're in front of it. So to unlock grey_door_1, the agent must first goto the door from room_2 (since they're in room_2 initially). Let me check the doors: room_2 is connected to room_1 via grey_door_1 and to room_4 via red_door_1. But red_door_1 must stay locked always, so that's not an option.

Wait, the constraints state that "red_door_1 is locked" must hold in every state. So we can't toggle it. So the only way to get to room_4 is through room_3 and red_door_2? Let's see. So the path would be room_2 -> room_1 via grey_door_1 (unlock it), then room_1 -> room_3 via green_door_1 (unlock that), then room_3 -> room_4 via red_door_2 (which is initially locked, but we can unlock it). But then we need to unlock green_door_1 and grey_door_1 first.

Wait, initial state: the agent is in room_2. The doors are all locked. So first step: go to the grey_door_1 from room_2. To do that, need to gotoempty or gotoobject, but maybe first, they need to go to the door. The "gotodoor" action for grey_door_1 in room_2. But to use gotodoor d r1 r2, the agent must be in a room connected by door d. So since the agent is in room_2, and grey_door_1 connects room_1 and 2, they can go to the door. But the precondition for gotodoor is that there's no object blocking the position in front of the door in the current room. So, in room_2, the objects present are green_box_1. Is green_box_1 blocking the door? The initial state doesn't mention any objects blocking doors. The problem description says that doors may be blocked by objects. Wait, the effect of drop is that if x was blocking a door, it's no longer blocked. So perhaps objects are blocking doors if they are in front of them. But in the initial state, the agent is in room_2, and green_box_1 is in room_2. But unless the agent is in front of the door, the box isn't blocking it. So maybe in the initial state, there's no object blocking the doors. So the agent can go to grey_door_1 in room_2.

So steps:

1. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_1 (since agent is in room_2, and door connects to room_1)
2. toggle grey_door_1 to unlock it.
3. Then, gotoroom room_2 room_1 grey_door_1 to move to room_1.
Once in room_1, the agent can go to green_door_1 (door to room_3). But green_door_1 is locked. So need to unlock it.
4. gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3
5. toggle green_door_1 to unlock it.
6. gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1 to get to room_3.
In room_3, there's yellow_box_1, red_ball_1, red_ball_2. The goal requires that when we are in room_4, we must have held yellow_box_1 before. So perhaps pick up yellow_box_1 here.

But first, to unlock red_door_2 (connecting room_3 and 4), which is locked. So the agent needs to go to red_door_2 from room_3. So:

7. gotodoor red_door_2 room_3 room_4
But before that, check if the door is blocked. Are there objects in room_3 blocking the door? The initial state has yellow_box_1, red_ball_1, and red_ball_2 in room_3. If any of these are in front of the door, they would block it. But the initial state doesn't specify positions, only which room the objects are in. Assuming that the doors are not blocked by objects unless stated. So agent can go to the door.

8. toggle red_door_2 (unlock it)
But wait, the goal requires that in the final state, the door is not locked. So we need to unlock red_door_2. But the initial state has it locked. So toggle once to unlock. Then, to get through, the door must be unlocked. So after toggling, it's unlocked.

Then, to go to room_4:

9. gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_2.

Once in room_4, the agent is there, satisfying the constraint that they must be in room_4 at least once. But the constraint says that if they are in room_4, they must have held yellow_box_1 earlier. So before step 9, the agent must have picked up yellow_box_1.

So let's adjust. When in room_3, before going to room_4, the agent needs to pick up yellow_box_1. So steps in room_3:

7. After entering room_3, gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_3
8. pick yellow_box_1 room_3 (since agent is not holding anything)
Then, proceed to the door.

But wait, after picking up the box, the agent needs to drop it somewhere, but maybe the constraint is just that they held it at some point before entering room_4. So even if they pick it up and then drop it in room_3, that's okay. But the constraint is that if you are in room_4 in any state, you must have held yellow_box_1 in an earlier state. So perhaps just picking it up and then dropping it in room_3 would suffice. But maybe it's better to carry it to room_4. Let me think. But maybe the agent can pick it up and then drop it later. Let's see.

So steps in room_3:

After step 6 (entering room_3):

7. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_3
8. pick yellow_box_1 room_3
9. drop yellow_box_1 room_3 (if needed, but maybe not necessary. The action of picking it up satisfies the constraint that they held it.)

But maybe the agent can just pick it up and then proceed. Then, when they go to room_4, they are holding it. Then drop it there? But that's optional unless required by other constraints. Let's proceed.

But first, after step 6, the agent is in room_3.

Then, need to handle the door to room_4 (red_door_2). So:

7. gotodoor red_door_2 room_3 room_4 (precondition: in room_3, which they are)
8. toggle red_door_2 (unlock it)
9. gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_2 (now in room_4)
But before this, the agent must have held yellow_box_1. So they need to pick it up in room_3 before going to room_4.

So steps in room_3:

7. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_3
8. pick yellow_box_1 room_3 (now holding it)
9. drop yellow_box_1 room_3 (so they can proceed to the door, but maybe they can go to the door while holding it? Wait, the "gotodoor" action requires that you are in the same room as the door, which they are. But when you pick up the box, you are no longer in front of it. Then, you can go to the door. Let's see.

Alternatively, after picking up yellow_box_1, they can go to the door. So:

7. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_3
8. pick yellow_box_1 room_3 (now holding it)
9. gotodoor red_door_2 room_3 room_4
10. toggle red_door_2 (unlock)
11. gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_2 (now in room_4, holding yellow_box_1)
Then, drop it in room_4? Or not necessary. But the constraint is that if they are in room_4, they must have held yellow_box_1 before. Since they are holding it when entering, that's okay. But when they enter room_4, they are in room_4 and have held it, so that's satisfied. But if they drop it in room_4, then in the state where they are in room_4, they are not holding it, but they did hold it before. So that's okay.

So perhaps after entering room_4, drop it. But maybe it's not needed. However, another constraint is that blue_box_1 must be in room_4 at least once. So blue_box_1 is in room_1 initially. So the agent needs to move it to room_4. How?

To do that, the agent needs to go to room_1, pick up blue_box_1, carry it to room_4. But the agent is currently in room_4. So how to get back to room_1. Let's see the path.

From room_4, the doors are red_door_1 (connects to room_2, but it's locked and must stay locked) and red_door_2 (connects to room_3, which is unlocked). So the agent can go back to room_3 via red_door_2. Then to room_1 via green_door_1 (which was unlocked earlier). Then room_1 to room_2 via grey_door_1 (unlocked earlier). So let's see:

But this is getting complicated. Let's plan step by step.

First, the main goal is to have a red door (d) connecting room_3 and room_4 (which is red_door_2), be in front of it, and it's unlocked. The final goal requires that the agent is in front of d, d is red, connects room_3 and 4, and is not locked. So the agent must be in front of red_door_2 in the final state, which is in room_3 or room_4? Since doors connect two rooms, the agent can be in front of the door from either room. Wait, the gotodoor action allows you to go in front of the door from the current room. So to be in front of red_door_2, the agent must be in either room_3 or room_4 and use gotodoor red_door_2 room3 room4 (if in room3) or gotodoor red_door_2 room4 room3 (if in room4). But the problem states that the door connects room3 and room4. So the final goal is to be in front of red_door_2 (which is red), have it unlocked, and it's connecting room3 and 4. So the final action should be gotodoor red_door_2, then toggle it to unlock if necessary. Wait, but initially, red_door_2 is locked. The agent toggles it once to unlock. Then, the final state requires it to be not locked. So if the agent toggles it once, it becomes unlocked. Then, in the final state, being in front of it and it's unlocked.

So the plan needs to end with being in front of red_door_2, which is unlocked.

But the agent might have to go through room_3 or room_4 to be in front of it. Let's think.

Suppose the agent is in room_4. To be in front of red_door_2, they need to go to the door from room_4. But the door connects room3 and 4. So gotodoor red_door_2 room4 room3. Then, they are in front of the door. But since the door is already unlocked, that's the final state. But the agent needs to reach that point.

But let's retrace. The agent is in room_2 initially. Let's outline the steps:

1. Unlock grey_door_1 (room_2 to room_1)
2. Unlock green_door_1 (room_1 to room_3)
3. Unlock red_door_2 (room_3 to room_4)
4. Pick up yellow_box_1 in room_3 before going to room_4.
5. Go to room_4, satisfying the constraint that the agent is in room_4 and had held yellow_box_1.
6. Then, return to room_3 to handle blue_box_1 in room_1.

But blue_box_1 is in room_1. So the agent needs to go from room_4 back to room3, then to room1, pick up blue_box_1, carry it to room4. How?

From room_4, the agent can go back to room3 via red_door_2 (unlocked). Then from room3, go to room1 via green_door_1 (unlocked). Then pick up blue_box_1 in room1, then return to room3, then to room4. But then, how to get blue_box_1 to room4. The agent can carry it through.

But this seems a lot. Let's see.

Alternatively, perhaps after the initial steps, the agent can go to room_1, get blue_box_1, bring it to room4 via room3 and red_door_2.

But let's plan:

Initial steps:

1. In room_2, go to grey_door_1 (gotodoor grey_door_1 room2 room1)
2. toggle grey_door_1 (unlocks it)
3. gotoroom room2 room1 grey_door_1 (now in room1)
4. gotoobject blue_box_1 room1 (since blue_box_1 is there)
5. pick blue_box_1 room1 (now carrying it)
6. Then, go to green_door_1 (gotodoor green_door_1 room1 room3)
7. toggle green_door_1 (unlock)
8. gotoroom room1 room3 green_door_1 (now in room3)
9. Now, need to go to red_door_2 in room3, unlock it, then go to room4
10. gotodoor red_door_2 room3 room4
11. toggle red_door_2 (unlock)
12. gotoroom room3 room4 red_door_2 (now in room4, carrying blue_box_1)
13. drop blue_box_1 room4 (satisfies the constraint that blue_box_1 is in room4)
14. Now, need to get back to room3 to handle yellow_box_1.

Wait, but the constraint for room4 is that whenever you are in room4, you must have held yellow_box_1 before. So when you first enter room4 (step12), you are holding blue_box_1, not yellow_box_1. So that would violate the constraint. Because in the state where you are in room4 (after step12), you haven't held yellow_box_1 yet. So this is a problem.

So the steps need to be adjusted. The agent must pick up yellow_box_1 in room3 before entering room4 for the first time. So the agent should first, after arriving in room3, pick up yellow_box_1, then proceed to unlock red_door_2 and go to room4.

Let's reorder:

After step8 (agent is in room3):

9. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room3
10. pick yellow_box_1 room3 (now holding it)
11. gotodoor red_door_2 room3 room4
12. toggle red_door_2 (unlock)
13. gotoroom room3 room4 red_door_2 (now in room4, holding yellow_box_1)
14. drop yellow_box_1 room4 (optional, but the constraint is satisfied because the agent held it before entering room4)
But wait, when the agent is in room4, the state after step13 is that they are in room4, holding yellow_box_1. So in that state, they are in room4 and have held yellow_box_1 (since they are holding it now, which implies they picked it up before). So that's okay. So the constraint is satisfied.

Then, the agent can proceed to drop yellow_box_1 in room4, but maybe not necessary. However, the agent needs to move blue_box_1 to room4. So after dropping yellow_box_1, they need to go back to room1 to get blue_box_1. But that's a lot of steps.

Alternatively, after entering room4, drop yellow_box_1, then go back to room3, then to room1, get blue_box_1, and bring it to room4. Let's see.

But this is getting very long. Let's think of a more optimal path. The plan needs to be as short as possible.

Alternative approach:

The main goal is to have the agent in front of red_door_2 (which is red, connects room3 and 4, and is unlocked). So perhaps the agent can do everything in room3 and not go to room4 until the end, but then the constraints require that they are in room4 at least once. Also, blue_box_1 must be in room4. So the agent must transport blue_box_1 to room4.

So steps:

1. Unlock grey_door_1 (room2 to room1)
2. Go to room1, pick up blue_box_1
3. Unlock green_door_1 (room1 to room3)
4. Go to room3, then unlock red_door_2
5. Go to room4, drop blue_box_1 there (satisfies blue_box_1 in room4)
6. Return to room3, pick up yellow_box_1 (to satisfy the constraint when entering room4 again)
7. Go back to room4 (but why? Maybe to satisfy being in room4 again, but perhaps once is enough)
But this seems complicated.

Alternatively, after bringing blue_box_1 to room4, the agent can then proceed to be in front of red_door_2 in room4.

Wait, the final goal requires the agent to be in front of red_door_2, which is unlocked. So perhaps the agent can be in room4, goto red_door_2 from room4, and then ensure it's unlocked.

But to unlock red_door_2, the agent must be in front of it. So steps:

From room3:

gotodoor red_door_2 room3 room4 → toggle (unlock) → then go to room4. But after that, to be in front of red_door_2 in room4, the agent can goto that door from room4.

But perhaps it's easier to be in front of red_door_2 from room3.

But the problem is that the final goal requires that the agent is in front of the door, which is red, connecting room3 and 4, and unlocked. So the agent can be in either room3 or room4, in front of the door. Let's choose the shortest path.

Let's try to plan the steps:

Initial steps:

1. In room2, go to grey_door_1: gotodoor grey_door_1 room2 room1
2. toggle grey_door_1 (unlock)
3. goto room1 via grey_door_1
4. In room1, pick up blue_box_1: gotoobject blue_box_1 room1 → pick blue_box_1 room1
5. Go to green_door_1: gotodoor green_door_1 room1 room3
6. toggle green_door_1 (unlock)
7. goto room3 via green_door_1
8. In room3, pick up yellow_box_1: gotoobject yellow_box_1 room3 → pick yellow_box_1 room3 (now holding yellow_box_1)
9. Go to red_door_2: gotodoor red_door_2 room3 room4
10. toggle red_door_2 (unlock)
11. goto room4 via red_door_2 (now in room4, holding yellow_box_1 and blue_box_1? Wait, no. At step8, agent picks up yellow_box_1. Then steps 9-11: carrying yellow_box_1. Then, in room4, need to drop blue_box_1. But the agent is holding blue_box_1? No, in step4, the agent picks up blue_box_1. Wait, no. Step4: pick blue_box_1. Then steps5-7: agent is carrying blue_box_1 to room3. So in room3, the agent is holding blue_box_1 and then picks up yellow_box_1? No, the agent can only carry one object at a time. Oh right! The "pick" action requires that you are not holding any other object. So steps need to be adjusted.

Ah, here's a mistake. After step4, the agent is holding blue_box_1. Then, when trying to pick up yellow_box_1 in step8, they can't because they are already holding blue_box_1. So this is a problem. Therefore, the agent needs to drop blue_box_1 somewhere before picking up yellow_box_1.

So revised steps:

1. goto grey_door_1 in room2, unlock, go to room1.
2. pick blue_box_1 in room1.
3. take it to room3 (unlock green_door_1, go there)
4. drop blue_box_1 in room3.
5. then pick up yellow_box_1 in room3.
6. take yellow_box_1 to room4 (unlock red_door_2, go there)
7. drop yellow_box_1 in room4.
8. return to room3, pick up blue_box_1, take it to room4.
But this is getting too long. Maybe there's a better way.

Alternatively:

After picking up blue_box_1 in room1, the agent can carry it to room4 via room3. But need to drop it somewhere. Let's see.

Another approach: since the agent can only carry one object at a time, the plan needs to include multiple pick and drop actions.

Let me try again:

Initial steps:

1. gotodoor grey_door_1 room2 room1
2. toggle grey_door_1 (unlock)
3. gotoroom room2 room1 grey_door_1 (now in room1)
4. gotoobject blue_box_1 room1
5. pick blue_box_1 room1 (now holding blue_box_1)
6. gotodoor green_door_1 room1 room3
7. toggle green_door_1 (unlock)
8. gotoroom room1 room3 green_door_1 (now in room3, carrying blue_box_1)
9. drop blue_box_1 room3 (now blue_box_1 is in room3)
10. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room3
11. pick yellow_box_1 room3 (now holding it)
12. gotodoor red_door_2 room3 room4
13. toggle red_door_2 (unlock)
14. gotoroom room3 room4 red_door_2 (now in room4, holding yellow_box_1)
15. drop yellow_box_1 room4 (optional)
16. Now, need to bring blue_box_1 from room3 to room4. So go back to room3:
17. gotodoor red_door_2 room4 room3 (since in room4, door connects to room3)
18. toggle red_door_2 (but it's already unlocked)
19. gotoroom room4 room3 red_door_2 (back to room3)
20. gotoobject blue_box_1 room3
21. pick blue_box_1 room3
22. gotodoor red_door_2 room3 room4
23. gotoroom room3 room4 red_door_2 (now in room4 with blue_box_1)
24. drop blue_box_1 room4 (now blue_box_1 is in room4)
25. Now, the agent needs to be in front of red_door_2, which is unlocked. So go to red_door_2 from room4:
26. gotodoor red_door_2 room4 room3
   Now, the agent is in front of red_door_2, which is unlocked. This satisfies the final goal.

But this seems very long. Let's check the constraints:

- Must be in room4 at least once: steps14 and 23, etc.

- If in room4, must have held yellow_box_1 earlier: in step14, agent is holding yellow_box_1 when entering room4. So that's satisfied.

- blue_box_1 must be in room4: achieved after step24.

- red_door_1 must stay locked in every state: yes, we never touched it.

- Must be in front of empty at least once: when? For example, after dropping an object, the agent is in front of it. Or when using gotoempty. Maybe after step9, when the agent drops blue_box_1 in room3, they are in front of empty. Or when using gotoempty action.

But the agent must perform gotoempty at least once. The problem states that "The following expression must hold in at least one state: "you are in front of empty"". So the agent must have used gotoempty or dropped an object which leaves them in front of empty. Wait, when you drop an object, you are in front of it (effect iv of drop). So after dropping, you are in front of the object, not empty. So to be in front of empty, the agent must use the gotoempty action. So we need to include that somewhere.

So in the current plan, the agent hasn't used gotoempty. So we need to add a step where they do that.

For example, after step3 (arrive in room1), before picking up blue_box_1, the agent can gotoempty to satisfy that constraint. But this adds steps. Alternatively, during movement, perhaps.

Another constraint: "If expression "red_door_2 is locked" holds in some state s, then "you are in front of empty" must hold at s or after". Initially, red_door_2 is locked. So the agent must be in front of empty either when red_door_2 is locked (which is initially true) or after. But since the agent needs to toggle red_door_2 to unlock it, after that, red_door_2 is not locked. So the only state where red_door_2 is locked is before step13. So the agent must use gotoempty either before step13 (when red_door_2 is locked) or after. So to satisfy this, after step12 (toggle red_door_2, which unlocks it), red_door_2 is no longer locked. So the only time red_door_2 is locked is from the initial state up to step12. So the agent must perform gotoempty in or after that time.

So, perhaps after step13 (gotoroom to room4), the agent is in room4. But red_door_2 is now unlocked, so the constraint doesn't apply. So the agent needs to have a state where red_door_2 is locked (which is true up to step12), and after that, ensure that they are in front of empty at some point.

So during the steps, after step12 (toggle red_door_2 to unlock), the agent must have a state where they are in front of empty. But how? They can perform gotoempty in room4 after arriving there. For example, after step14 (arrive in room4 with yellow_box_1), they can gotoempty.

But then, after dropping yellow_box_1 (step15), they are in front of it, not empty. So maybe after step14, before dropping, do gotoempty:

14. gotoroom room3 room4 red_door_2 (in room4)
15. gotoempty
16. drop yellow_box_1 room4

This adds a step but satisfies the constraint.

Also, another constraint: "The following expression must hold in at least one state: "you are in front of red_door_2"". This is achieved in steps12 and 26.

Another constraint: "If you are in front of red_door_2 in some state, you must have been in front of green_box_1 before". So before any step where the agent is in front of red_door_2 (like step12), there must be a prior step where they were in front of green_box_1. green_box_1 is in room2 initially. So how can the agent be in front of green_box_1? They are in room2 initially, so they can gotoobject green_box_1 room2. But when? Let's see.

The agent starts in room2. green_box_1 is in room2. So initial steps can be:

1. gotoobject green_box_1 room2
2. Then proceed to gotodoor grey_door_1.

This way, step1 satisfies being in front of green_box_1. Then, when later in step12 (gotodoor red_door_2), the agent is in front of red_door_2, and since step1 was before, the constraint is satisfied.

But this adds steps. Let's adjust the plan:

New steps:

0. Initial state: in room2.

1. gotoobject green_box_1 room2 (now in front of green_box_1)
2. gotodoor grey_door_1 room2 room1
3. toggle grey_door_1 (unlock)
4. gotoroom room2 room1 grey_door_1 (now in room1)
5. gotoobject blue_box_1 room1
6. pick blue_box_1 room1
7. gotodoor green_door_1 room1 room3
8. toggle green_door_1 (unlock)
9. gotoroom room1 room3 green_door_1 (now in room3)
10. drop blue_box_1 room3 (now in front of blue_box_1)
11. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room3
12. pick yellow_box_1 room3
13. gotodoor red_door_2 room3 room4 (now in front of red_door_2)
14. toggle red_door_2 (unlock)
15. gotoroom room3 room4 red_door_2 (now in room4)
16. gotoempty (to satisfy being in front of empty)
17. drop yellow_box_1 room4
18. gotodoor red_door_2 room4 room3 (now in front of red_door_2)
19. Now, to ensure blue_box_1 is in room4:
20. gotoroom room4 room3 red_door_2 (back to room3)
21. gotoobject blue_box_1 room3
22. pick blue_box_1 room3
23. gotodoor red_door_2 room3 room4
24. gotoroom room3 room4 red_door_2 (now in room4 with blue_box_1)
25. drop blue_box_1 room4
26. gotodoor red_door_2 room4 room3 (now in front of red_door_2, which is unlocked)
   
Now, checking the constraints:

- Be in room4: steps15, 24, 25, 26.

- When in room4 (first time at step15), the agent had held yellow_box_1 in step12-15.

- blue_box_1 in room4: step25.

- red_door_1 remains locked.

- Be in front of empty: step16.

- red_door_2 is locked in some state (initially, and up to step14). The constraint says that if red_door_2 is locked in a state, then the agent must be in front of empty at or after that state. Since red_door_2 is locked from initial until step14, and step16 is after that, it's satisfied.

- Be in front of red_door_2: steps13, 18, 23, 26. The first occurrence is step13, which must have been preceded by being in front of green_box_1 in step1.

- red_door_2 must be not locked in some state (after step14). That's true.

- If red_door_2 is not locked (after step14), then red_ball_1 must have been in room1 in a prior state. red_ball_1 is initially in room3. So this is a problem. The constraint says: if red_door_2 is not locked in any state, then red_ball_1 must have been in room1 in a prior state.

But red_ball_1 is in room3 initially. So how to satisfy this?

This is a crucial constraint. Let me re-read it:

"If expression "red_door_2 is not locked" holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: "red_ball_1 is in room_1""

So after unlocking red_door_2 (step14), the agent must have had red_ball_1 in room_1 at some point before. But red_ball_1 starts in room3, so the agent needs to move it to room1.

This adds a new requirement: move red_ball_1 from room3 to room1.

But how? The agent must go to room3, pick up red_ball_1, carry it to room1. But the agent is in room1 after step4, then moves to room3, but needs to return to room1 with red_ball_1.

This complicates the plan. Let's adjust.

So, after step9 (agent in room3, has dropped blue_box_1), the agent can pick up red_ball_1, carry it to room1, drop it there, then proceed.

So inserting steps:

After step10 (drop blue_box_1 in room3):

10a. gotoobject red_ball_1 room3
10b. pick red_ball_1 room3
10c. gotodoor green_door_1 room3 room1
10d. gotoroom room3 room1 green_door_1 (now in room1)
10e. drop red_ball_1 room1
10f. gotodoor green_door_1 room1 room3
10g. toggle green_door_1 (but it's already unlocked)
10h. gotoroom room1 room3 green_door_1 (back to room3)
Then proceed with step11 (gotoobject yellow_box_1).

But this adds many steps. This makes the plan longer, but necessary to satisfy the constraint.

Let's outline the revised steps with this addition:

0. Initial state: room2.

1. gotoobject green_box_1 room2 (front of green_box_1)
2. gotodoor grey_door_1 room2 room1
3. toggle grey_door_1 (unlock)
4. gotoroom room2 room1 grey_door_1 (room1)
5. gotoobject blue_box_1 room1
6. pick blue_box_1 room1
7. gotodoor green_door_1 room1 room3
8. toggle green_door_1 (unlock)
9. gotoroom room1 room3 green_door_1 (room3)
10. drop blue_box_1 room3
11. gotoobject red_ball_1 room3
12. pick red_ball_1 room3
13. gotodoor green_door_1 room3 room1
14. gotoroom room3 room1 green_door_1 (room1)
15. drop red_ball_1 room1 (now red_ball_1 is in room1)
16. gotodoor green_door_1 room1 room3
17. gotoroom room1 room3 green_door_1 (room3)
18. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room3
19. pick yellow_box_1 room3
20. gotodoor red_door_2 room3 room4
21. toggle red_door_2 (unlock)
22. gotoroom room3 room4 red_door_2 (room4)
23. gotoempty (satisfy front of empty)
24. drop yellow_box_1 room4
25. gotodoor red_door_2 room4 room3
26. gotoroom room4 room3 red_door_2 (room3)
27. gotoobject blue_box_1 room3
28. pick blue_box_1 room3
29. gotodoor red_door_2 room3 room4
30. gotoroom room3 room4 red_door_2 (room4)
31. drop blue_box_1 room4
32. gotodoor red_door_2 room4 room3 (now in front of red_door_2, which is unlocked)

This plan now includes moving red_ball_1 to room1 (steps11-15), satisfying the constraint that when red_door_2 is unlocked (step21), there was a prior state where red_ball_1 was in room1 (step15).

But this is a lot of steps. Is there a shorter way?

Alternatively, instead of moving blue_box_1 and red_ball_1 separately, perhaps combine steps. For example, after moving red_ball_1 to room1, then pick up blue_box_1 and take it to room4.

Wait, after step15 (drop red_ball_1 in room1), the agent is in room1. They can then pick up blue_box_1 again (if it's still there). But in step5-6, the agent picked up blue_box_1 and carried it to room3, then dropped it in step10. So blue_box_1 is in room3. So after step15, blue_box_1 is in room3. So the agent needs to go back to room3 to get it.

Hmm. This is getting very complex. It's possible that the optimal plan requires these steps. Given the constraints, especially the one about red_ball_1 needing to be in room1 before red_door_2 is unlocked, this seems unavoidable.

Let me check the final constraints:

- The final goal is achieved in step32: in front of red_door_2 (d is red, connects room3 and4, not locked).

- All constraints are satisfied:

   - Visited room4: steps22,30, etc.

   - When in room4, held yellow_box_1 before (step19-22).

   - blue_box_1 in room4: step31.

   - red_door_1 remains locked.

   - Been in front of empty: step23.

   - red_door_2 was locked in initial state, and step21 unlocks it. After step21, red_door_2 is unlocked. So the constraint that when red_door_2 is locked, then be in front of empty after. Since after step21, red_door_2 is unlocked, but in step23 (gotoempty), that's after.

   - Been in front of red_door_2: steps20,25,29,32. The first time is step20, which must have been preceded by step1 (front of green_box_1).

   - red_door_2 not locked in step21 onward, and prior step15 has red_ball_1 in room1.

This seems to satisfy all constraints. However, the plan is quite long, and maybe there's a shorter way. For example, can we avoid moving blue_box_1 twice?

Alternative idea: after moving red_ball_1 to room1 (step15), the agent can go to room1, pick up blue_box_1 (which is in room1?), but no, blue_box_1 was moved to room3 in step10. So no. So the agent has to go back to room3 to get blue_box_1.

Alternatively, after step15 (in room1), the agent can go to room2 via grey_door_1, then pick up green_box_1, but I'm not sure if that helps.

This seems to be the minimal steps required given all the constraints. Let's count the steps in the plan outlined above:

Steps 1-32, but some steps may be combined. For example, after step15 (drop red_ball_1 in room1), the agent needs to return to room3. Steps16-17: gotodoor green_door_1 and goto room3. Then step18: gotoobject yellow_box_1.

But this plan is quite long. However, since the problem requires an optimal plan (shortest possible), perhaps there's a way to optimize.

Wait, maybe after step10 (drop blue_box_1 in room3), instead of moving red_ball_1, the agent can pick up red_ball_1 and take it to room1, then proceed.

Wait, the agent is in room3, has blue_box_1 dropped there. Then:

10. drop blue_box_1 room3

11. gotoobject red_ball_1 room3

12. pick red_ball_1 room3

13. gotodoor green_door_1 room3 room1

14. gotoroom room3 room1 green_door_1 (room1)

15. drop red_ball_1 room1

16. gotodoor green_door_1 room1 room3

17. gotoroom room1 room3 green_door_1 (room3)

18. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room3

19. pick yellow_box_1 room3

20. gotodoor red_door_2 room3 room4

21. toggle red_door_2 (unlock)

22. gotoroom room3 room4 red_door_2 (room4)

23. gotoempty

24. drop yellow_box_1 room4

25. gotodoor red_door_2 room4 room3

26. gotoroom room4 room3 red_door_2 (room3)

27. gotoobject blue_box_1 room3

28. pick blue_box_1 room3

29. gotodoor red_door_2 room3 room4

30. gotoroom room3 room4 red_door_2 (room4)

31. drop blue_box_1 room4

32. gotodoor red_door_2 room4 room3

This is 32 steps, which seems long. Let me see if any steps can be optimized.

For example, after step22 (in room4), can the agent directly go to red_door_2 and be in front of it without needing to go back? Because the final goal is to be in front of red_door_2 (room3-room4 door) in an unlocked state. If the agent is in room4, they can go to the door from room4:

22. gotoroom room3 room4 red_door_2 (now in room4)

23. gotodoor red_door_2 room4 room3

24. Now in front of red_door_2, which is unlocked. This satisfies the final goal. So steps after 22 can be:

23. gotodoor red_door_2 room4 room3 (in front of door)

But then, the blue_box_1 is still in room3. So how to get it to room4.

Ah, but the constraint is that blue_box_1 must be in room4 in at least one state. So maybe the agent can leave blue_box_1 in room3 and not move it, but that's not possible because blue_box_1 is initially in room1 and moved to room3. So the agent must move it to room4.

So the steps are necessary. However, perhaps after step22, the agent can drop yellow_box_1 in room4, then go back to room3, pick up blue_box_1 and bring it to room4, then go to the door.

Alternatively, after step22, the agent is in room4. They can drop yellow_box_1, then go back to room3, get blue_box_1, return to room4, drop it, then go to the door.

But this adds steps. The plan must include moving blue_box_1 to room4.

Given all the constraints, this seems to be the minimal steps required. Therefore, the final plan would look like the one outlined above, ensuring all constraints are met.
