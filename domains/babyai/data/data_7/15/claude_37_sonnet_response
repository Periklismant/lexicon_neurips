Let's break down the problem and understand what we need to do. We'll first analyze the initial state, the goal, and the constraints. Then, we'll come up with a plan that satisfies all constraints and reaches the goal.

Initial State:
- We are in room_2.
- green_ball_1 and blue_box_1 are in room_1.
- green_box_1 is in room_2.
- yellow_box_1, red_ball_1, and red_ball_2 are in room_3.
- green_ball_2 and yellow_box_2 are in room_4.
- All doors (grey_door_1, green_door_1, red_door_1, red_door_2) are locked.

Goal:
- There is a red door connecting room_3 and room_4 (which is red_door_2), and we are in front of it, and it is unlocked.

Constraints:
1. At some point, we must be in room_4.
2. Before being in room_4, we must hold yellow_box_1.
3. At some point, blue_box_1 must be in room_4.
4. red_door_1 must always remain locked.
5. At some point, we must be in front of empty.
6. At some point, red_door_2 must be locked.
7. After red_door_2 is locked, we must be in front of empty.
8. At some point, we must be in front of red_door_2.
9. Before being in front of red_door_2, we must be in front of green_box_1.
10. At some point, red_door_2 must be unlocked.
11. Before red_door_2 is unlocked, red_ball_1 must be in room_1.

Let's think of a plan. I'll work backward from the goal.

Our goal is to be in front of red_door_2 (which connects room_3 and room_4), and the door should be unlocked. According to constraint 9, before being in front of red_door_2, we must be in front of green_box_1. And according to constraint 10, before red_door_2 is unlocked, red_ball_1 must be in room_1.

Let's also analyze the room connections:
- grey_door_1 connects room_1 and room_2.
- green_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3.
- red_door_1 connects room_2 and room_4 (must remain locked as per constraint 4).
- red_door_2 connects room_3 and room_4 (needs to be toggled to satisfy the goal).

Now, let's draft a plan.

Starting from room_2:
1. We need to be in front of green_box_1 (which is in room_2) at some point.
2. We need to unlock grey_door_1 to go to room_1 and get blue_box_1 (according to constraint 3).
3. We need to bring red_ball_1 from room_3 to room_1 (according to constraint 11).
4. We need to hold yellow_box_1 (from room_3) before going to room_4 (according to constraint 2).
5. We need to toggle red_door_2 to unlock it.

Here's a sequence of actions:

1. Go in front of green_box_1 in room_2 (to satisfy constraint 9).
2. Go in front of grey_door_1 in room_2.
3. Toggle grey_door_1 to unlock it.
4. Go to room_1 from room_2 using grey_door_1.
5. Go in front of green_door_1 in room_1.
6. Toggle green_door_1 to unlock it.
7. Go to room_3 from room_1 using green_door_1.
8. Go in front of red_ball_1 in room_3.
9. Pick up red_ball_1 in room_3.
10. Go in front of green_door_1 in room_3.
11. Go to room_1 from room_3 using green_door_1.
12. Go in front of empty to drop the red_ball_1.
13. Drop red_ball_1 in room_1 (to satisfy constraint 11).
14. Go in front of blue_box_1 in room_1.
15. Pick up blue_box_1 in room_1.
16. Go in front of green_door_1 in room_1.
17. Go to room_3 from room_1 using green_door_1.
18. Go in front of yellow_box_1 in room_3.
19. Go in front of empty.
20. Drop blue_box_1 in room_3.
21. Go in front of yellow_box_1 in room_3.
22. Pick up yellow_box_1 in room_3 (to satisfy constraint 2).
23. Go in front of red_door_2 in room_3.
24. Toggle red_door_2 to unlock it (satisfying constraint 10).
25. Go to room_4 from room_3 using red_door_2 (satisfying constraint 1).
26. Go in front of empty.
27. Drop yellow_box_1 in room_4.
28. Go in front of green_ball_2 in room_4.
29. Pick up green_ball_2 in room_4.
30. Go in front of red_door_2 in room_4.
31. Go to room_3 from room_4 using red_door_2.
32. Go in front of blue_box_1 in room_3.
33. Go in front of empty.
34. Drop green_ball_2 in room_3.
35. Go in front of blue_box_1 in room_3.
36. Pick up blue_box_1 in room_3.
37. Go in front of red_door_2 in room_3.
38. Go to room_4 from room_3 using red_door_2.
39. Go in front of empty.
40. Drop blue_box_1 in room_4 (satisfying constraint 3).
41. Go in front of red_door_2 in room_4.
42. Toggle red_door_2 to lock it.
43. Go in front of empty (satisfying constraint 7).
44. Go in front of red_door_2 in room_4.
45. Toggle red_door_2 to unlock it.
46. Go in front of red_door_2 in room_4 (satisfying the goal).

Wait, I think there's an issue with the plan. Let's reanalyze the constraints.

Constraint 4 says "red_door_1 is locked" must hold in every state, so we can't use red_door_1. But there's a problem: the only way to get from room_2 to room_4 is through red_door_1. But we can't unlock it due to constraint 4. The only other way to get to room_4 is from room_3 using red_door_2. Let's rework the plan:

Starting from room_2:
1. We need to be in front of green_box_1 (which is in room_2) at some point.
2. We need to unlock grey_door_1 to go to room_1.
3. From room_1, we can go to room_3 using green_door_1.
4. We need to bring red_ball_1 from room_3 to room_1 (according to constraint 11).
5. We need to hold yellow_box_1 (from room_3) before going to room_4 (according to constraint 2).
6. We need to toggle red_door_2 to unlock it and then go to room_4.
7. After being in room_4, we need to bring blue_box_1 from room_1 to room_4 (according to constraint 3).

Here's the revised sequence of actions:

1. Go in front of green_box_1 in room_2 (to satisfy constraint 9).
2. Go in front of grey_door_1 in room_2.
3. Toggle grey_door_1 to unlock it.
4. Go to room_1 from room_2 using grey_door_1.
5. Go in front of green_door_1 in room_1.
6. Toggle green_door_1 to unlock it.
7. Go to room_3 from room_1 using green_door_1.
8. Go in front of red_ball_1 in room_3.
9. Pick up red_ball_1 in room_3.
10. Go in front of green_door_1 in room_3.
11. Go to room_1 from room_3 using green_door_1.
12. Go in front of empty.
13. Drop red_ball_1 in room_1 (to satisfy constraint 11).
14. Go in front of green_door_1 in room_1.
15. Go to room_3 from room_1 using green_door_1.
16. Go in front of yellow_box_1 in room_3.
17. Pick up yellow_box_1 in room_3 (to satisfy constraint 2).
18. Go in front of red_door_2 in room_3.
19. Toggle red_door_2 to unlock it (satisfying constraint 10).
20. Go to room_4 from room_3 using red_door_2 (satisfying constraint 1).
21. Go in front of empty.
22. Drop yellow_box_1 in room_4.
23. Go in front of red_door_2 in room_4.
24. Go to room_3 from room_4 using red_door_2.
25. Go in front of green_door_1 in room_3.
26. Go to room_1 from room_3 using green_door_1.
27. Go in front of blue_box_1 in room_1.
28. Pick up blue_box_1 in room_1.
29. Go in front of green_door_1 in room_1.
30. Go to room_3 from room_1 using green_door_1.
31. Go in front of red_door_2 in room_3.
32. Go to room_4 from room_3 using red_door_2.
33. Go in front of empty.
34. Drop blue_box_1 in room_4 (satisfying constraint 3).
35. Go in front of red_door_2 in room_4.
36. Toggle red_door_2 to lock it (satisfying constraint 6).
37. Go in front of empty (satisfying constraint 7).
38. Go in front of red_door_2 in room_4.
39. Toggle red_door_2 to unlock it.
40. Go in front of red_door_2 in room_3 (satisfying the goal).

Wait, there's still an issue. The goal is to be in front of an unlocked red_door_2. However, in the above plan, the last action puts us in front of red_door_2 on the room_3 side, but the goal might require us to be on the side where we toggled it to unlock it, which is the room_4 side. Let me revise the last few steps:

36. Toggle red_door_2 to lock it (satisfying constraint 6).
37. Go in front of empty (satisfying constraint 7).
38. Go in front of red_door_2 in room_4.
39. Toggle red_door_2 to unlock it.
40. Stay in front of red_door_2 in room_4 (satisfying the goal).

Wait, there's another issue. I need to specify which side of the door we're referring to.

Let's think through the plan again:

Starting from room_2:
1. I go in front of green_box_1 (which is in room_2).
2. I go in front of grey_door_1 in room_2.
3. I toggle grey_door_1 to unlock it.
4. I go to room_1 from room_2 using grey_door_1.
5. I go in front of green_door_1 in room_1.
6. I toggle green_door_1 to unlock it.
7. I go to room_3 from room_1 using green_door_1.
8. I go in front of red_ball_1 in room_3.
9. I pick up red_ball_1 in room_3.
10. I go in front of green_door_1 in room_3.
11. I go to room_1 from room_3 using green_door_1.
12. I go in front of empty.
13. I drop red_ball_1 in room_1 (to satisfy constraint 11).
14. I go in front of green_door_1 in room_1.
15. I go to room_3 from room_1 using green_door_1.
16. I go in front of yellow_box_1 in room_3.
17. I pick up yellow_box_1 in room_3 (to satisfy constraint 2).
18. I go in front of red_door_2 in room_3.
19. I toggle red_door_2 to unlock it (satisfying constraint 10).
20. I go to room_4 from room_3 using red_door_2 (satisfying constraint 1).
21. I go in front of empty.
22. I drop yellow_box_1 in room_4.
23. I go in front of red_door_2 in room_4.
24. I go to room_3 from room_4 using red_door_2.
25. I go in front of green_door_1 in room_3.
26. I go to room_1 from room_3 using green_door_1.
27. I go in front of blue_box_1 in room_1.
28. I pick up blue_box_1 in room_1.
29. I go in front of green_door_1 in room_1.
30. I go to room_3 from room_1 using green_door_1.
31. I go in front of red_door_2 in room_3.
32. I go to room_4 from room_3 using red_door_2.
33. I go in front of empty.
34. I drop blue_box_1 in room_4 (satisfying constraint 3).
35. I go in front of red_door_2 in room_4.
36. I toggle red_door_2 to lock it (satisfying constraint 6).
37. I go in front of empty (satisfying constraint 7).
38. I go in front of red_door_2 in room_4.
39. I toggle red_door_2 to unlock it.
40. I go in front of red_door_2 in room_3 (satisfying the goal).

Actually, there's a problem with my plan. The constraint says "red_door_2 is not locked" and "you are in front of red_door_2". Let's look at the goal again: "There is a door d such that 'The following conditions are all true: "d is red", "room_3 and room_4 are connected via d", "you are in front of d", "d is not locked""

So, the door has to be red, connect room_3 and room_4, you need to be in front of it, and it must be unlocked. This door is indeed red_door_2. And to be in front of it, we can be in either room_3 or room_4 and be in front of red_door_2.

Let's revise the plan again:

Starting from room_2:
1. Go in front of green_box_1 in room_2 (to satisfy constraint 9).
2. Go in front of grey_door_1 in room_2.
3. Toggle grey_door_1 to unlock it.
4. Go to room_1 from room_2 using grey_door_1.
5. Go in front of green_door_1 in room_1.
6. Toggle green_door_1 to unlock it.
7. Go to room_3 from room_1 using green_door_1.
8. Go in front of red_ball_1 in room_3.
9. Pick up red_ball_1 in room_3.
10. Go in front of green_door_1 in room_3.
11. Go to room_1 from room_3 using green_door_1.
12. Go in front of empty.
13. Drop red_ball_1 in room_1 (to satisfy constraint 11).
14. Go in front of green_door_1 in room_1.
15. Go to room_3 from room_1 using green_door_1.
16. Go in front of yellow_box_1 in room_3.
17. Pick up yellow_box_1 in room_3 (to satisfy constraint 2).
18. Go in front of red_door_2 in room_3.
19. Toggle red_door_2 to unlock it (to satisfy constraint 10).
20. Go to room_4 from room_3 using red_door_2 (satisfying constraint 1).
21. Go in front of empty.
22. Drop yellow_box_1 in room_4.
23. Go in front of red_door_2 in room_4.
24. Go to room_3 from room_4 using red_door_2.
25. Go in front of green_door_1 in room_3.
26. Go to room_1 from room_3 using green_door_1.
27. Go in front of blue_box_1 in room_1.
28. Pick up blue_box_1 in room_1.
29. Go in front of green_door_1 in room_1.
30. Go to room_3 from room_1 using green_door_1.
31. Go in front of red_door_2 in room_3.
32. Go to room_4 from room_3 using red_door_2.
33. Go in front of empty.
34. Drop blue_box_1 in room_4 (satisfying constraint 3).
35. Go in front of red_door_2 in room_4.
36. Toggle red_door_2 to lock it (satisfying constraint 6).
37. Go in front of empty (satisfying constraint 5 and constraint 7).
38. Go in front of red_door_2 in room_4.
39. Toggle red_door_2 to unlock it.
40. Go in front of red_door_2 in room_3 (satisfying constraint 8 and the goal).

However, I realize that constraint 8 says "At some point, we must be in front of red_door_2" and constraint 9 says "If expression 'you are in front of red_door_2' holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: 'you are in front of green_box_1'". In my plan, I'm in front of green_box_1 at step 1 and in front of red_door_2 at step 18, which satisfies this constraint. However, I'm also in front of red_door_2 at various other points in the plan, so I'm not sure if this constraint is properly satisfied. Let me rethink this.

Actually, the constraint is satisfied as long as whenever I'm in front of red_door_2, there's a previous state where I was in front of green_box_1. Since in my plan, I'm in front of green_box_1 at step 1, any time I'm in front of red_door_2 later in the plan satisfies this constraint.

As a sanity check, let's review all constraints:

1. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'you are in room_4'" - Satisfied at step 20.
2. "If expression 'you are in room_4' holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which 'you are holding yellow_box_1' is true." - Satisfied; we pick up yellow_box_1 at step 17, before being in room_4 at step 20.
3. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'blue_box_1 is in room_4'" - Satisfied at step 34.
4. "The following expression must hold in every state: 'red_door_1 is locked'" - Satisfied as we never toggle red_door_1.
5. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'you are in front of empty'" - Satisfied at step 37 (and also at step 12 and other points in the plan).
6. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'red_door_2 is locked'" - Satisfied at step 36 (and also at the beginning of the plan).
7. "If expression 'red_door_2 is locked' holds in some state s, then expression 'you are in front of empty' must hold at s or at some state after s" - Satisfied; after step 36 (where red_door_2 is locked), we go in front of empty at step 37.
8. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'you are in front of red_door_2'" - Satisfied at several steps, including step 18, step 23, etc.
9. "If expression 'you are in front of red_door_2' holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which 'you are in front of green_box_1' is true." - Satisfied; step 1 (in front of green_box_1) occurs before all instances where we're in front of red_door_2.
10. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'red_door_2 is not locked'" - Satisfied after step 19 (when we toggle red_door_2 to unlock it).
11. "If expression 'red_door_2 is not locked' holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which 'red_ball_1 is in room_1' is true." - Satisfied; step 13 (dropping red_ball_1 in room_1) occurs before step 19 (where red_door_2 is unlocked).

It looks like all constraints are satisfied with this plan. However, let me double-check the goal again:

Goal: "There is a door d such that 'The following conditions are all true: "d is red", "room_3 and room_4 are connected via d", "you are in front of d", "d is not locked""

Let's check if the goal is satisfied at the end of our plan:
- d is red_door_2, which is red (given in the initial state).
- room_3 and room_4 are connected via red_door_2 (given in the initial state).
- At step 40, we are in front of red_door_2 in room_3.
- Red_door_2 is unlocked after step 39.

So, the goal is satisfied at the end of the plan. However, I'd like to ensure the plan is also optimal (with regards to the number of actions) and there are no redundancies. Let me check if there's anything we can optimize.

Actually, I believe there is a shorter path:

1. Go in front of green_box_1 in room_2 (to satisfy constraint 9).
2. Go in front of grey_door_1 in room_2.
3. Toggle grey_door_1 to unlock it.
4. Go to room_1 from room_2 using grey_door_1.
5. Go in front of green_door_1 in room_1.
6. Toggle green_door_1 to unlock it.
7. Go to room_3 from room_1 using green_door_1.
8. Go in front of red_ball_1 in room_3.
9. Pick up red_ball_1 in room_3.
10. Go in front of green_door_1 in room_3.
11. Go to room_1 from room_3 using green_door_1.
12. Go in front of empty.
13. Drop red_ball_1 in room_1 (to satisfy constraint 11).
14. Go in front of blue_box_1 in room_1.
15. Pick up blue_box_1 in room_1.
16. Go in front of green_door_1 in room_1.
17. Go to room_3 from room_1 using green_door_1.
18. Go in front of yellow_box_1 in room_3.
19. Go in front of empty.
20. Drop blue_box_1 in room_3.
21. Go in front of yellow_box_1 in room_3.
22. Pick up yellow_box_1 in room_3 (to satisfy constraint 2).
23. Go in front of red_door_2 in room_3.
24. Toggle red_door_2 to unlock it (to satisfy constraint 10).
25. Go to room_4 from room_3 using red_door_2 (satisfying constraint 1).
26. Go in front of empty.
27. Drop yellow_box_1 in room_4.
28. Go in front of red_door_2 in room_4.
29. Go to room_3 from room_4 using red_door_2.
30. Go in front of blue_box_1 in room_3.
31. Pick up blue_box_1 in room_3.
32. Go in front of red_door_2 in room_3.
33. Go to room_4 from room_3 using red_door_2.
34. Go in front of empty.
35. Drop blue_box_1 in room_4 (satisfying constraint 3).
36. Go in front of red_door_2 in room_4.
37. Toggle red_door_2 to lock it (satisfying constraint 6).
38. Go in front of empty (satisfying constraint 5 and constraint 7).
39. Go in front of red_door_2 in room_4.
40. Toggle red_door_2 to unlock it.
41. Go in front of red_door_2 in room_3 (satisfying the goal).

This plan seems to be more efficient because we don't have to make as many room transitions.

Wait, I think I misunderstood something in the previous step. I think instead of going back to room_3 at the end, we can just stay in room_4. So the end of the plan could be:

37. Toggle red_door_2 to lock it (satisfying constraint 6).
38. Go in front of empty (satisfying constraint 5 and constraint 7).
39. Go in front of red_door_2 in room_4.
40. Toggle red_door_2 to unlock it.
41. The goal is satisfied as we are in front of an unlocked red_door_2.

Actually, I'm confused about whether the goal requires us to be in room_3 in front of red_door_2 or in room_4 in front of red_door_2. Let's re-read the goal:

Goal: "There is a door d such that 'The following conditions are all true: "d is red", "room_3 and room_4 are connected via d", "you are in front of d", "d is not locked""

The goal mentions "you are in front of d" but doesn't specify which side (room_3 or room_4). If we're in front of red_door_2 from either room_3 or room_4 and the door is unlocked, then the goal is satisfied. Just to be sure, I'll end the plan with us being in front of red_door_2 in room_3, as I previously thought.

After re-evaluating the plan, I still believe the revised version is optimal. However I think between this and a couple versions ago, I mixed up the plan. Let me write down the plan one more time:

Revised Plan:
1. Go in front of green_box_1 in room_2 (to satisfy constraint 9).
2. Go in front of grey_door_1 in room_2.
3. Toggle grey_door_1 to unlock it.
4. Go to room_1 from room_2 using grey_door_1.
5. Go in front of green_door_1 in room_1.
6. Toggle green_door_1 to unlock it.
7. Go to room_3 from room_1 using green_door_1.
8. Go in front of red_ball_1 in room_3.
9. Pick up red_ball_1 in room_3.
10. Go in front of green_door_1 in room_3.
11. Go to room_1 from room_3 using green_door_1.
12. Go in front of empty.

20. Drop blue_box_1 in room_3.
21. Go in front of yellow_box_1 in room_3.
22. Pick up yellow_box_1 in room_3 (to satisfy constraint 2).
23. Go in front of red_door_2 in room_3.
24. Toggle red_door_2 to unlock it (to satisfy constraint 10).
25. Go to room_4 from room_3 using red_door_2 (satisfying constraint 1).
26. Go in front of empty.
27. Drop yellow_box_1 in room_4.
28. Go in front of red_door_2 in room_4.
29. Go to room_3 from room_4 using red_door_2.
30. Go in front of blue_box_1 in room_3.
31. Pick up blue_box_1 in room_3.
32. Go in front of red_door_2 in room_3.
33. Go to room_4 from room_3 using red_door_2.
34. Go in front of empty.
35. Drop blue_box_1 in room_4 (satisfying constraint 3).
36. Go in front of red_door_2 in room_4.
37. Toggle red_door_2 to lock it (satisfying constraint 6).
38. Go in front of empty (satisfying constraint 5 and constraint 7).
39. Go in front of red_door_2 in room_4.
40. Toggle red_door_2 to unlock it.
41. Go in front of red_door_2 in room_3 (satisfying the goal).

Let's enumerate all of the constraints again to make absolutely sure our plan meets each one.

1. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'you are in room_4'"
   - Satisfied at step 25.

2. "If expression 'you are in room_4' holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which 'you are holding yellow_box_1' is true."
   - Satisfied: we hold yellow_box_1 at step 22, before being in room_4 at step 25.

3. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'blue_box_1 is in room_4'"
   - Satisfied at step 35.

4. "The following expression must hold in every state: 'red_door_1 is locked'"
   - Satisfied: we never toggle red_door_1.

5. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'you are in front of empty'"
   - Satisfied at step 12, step 19, step 26, step 34, and step 38.

6. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'red_door_2 is locked'"
   - Satisfied initially and at step 37.

7. "If expression 'red_door_2 is locked' holds in some state s, then expression 'you are in front of empty' must hold at s or at some state after s"
   - Satisfied initially (red_door_2 is locked, and we later go in front of empty) and at step 37 (where red_door_2 is locked), followed by step 38 (where we go in front of empty).

8. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'you are in front of red_door_2'"
   - Satisfied at steps 23, 28, 32, 36, 39, and 41.

9. "If expression 'you are in front of red_door_2' holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which 'you are in front of green_box_1' is true."
   - Satisfied: step 1 (in front of green_box_1) occurs before all instances where we're in front of red_door_2.

10. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'red_door_2 is not locked'"
    - Satisfied at step 24 when we toggle red_door_2 to unlock it, and also at step 40.

11. "If expression 'red_door_2 is not locked' holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which 'red_ball_1 is in room_1' is true."
    - Satisfied: step 13 (dropping red_ball_1 in room_1) occurs before steps 24 and 40 (where red_door_2 is unlocked).

It looks like all constraints are satisfied with this plan.

As for the goal, "There is a door d such that 'The following conditions are all true: "d is red", "room_3 and room_4 are connected via d", "you are in front of d", "d is not locked"": this is satisfied at step 41, where we are in front of red_door_2 (which is red and connects room_3 and room_4) and the door is unlocked.

I think the revised plan is optimal and satisfies all constraints. Let's put it in the required format:

```
gotoobject green_box_1 room_2
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_1
toggle grey_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_1 grey_door_1
gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3
toggle green_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1
gotoobject red_ball_1 room_3
pick red_ball_1 room_3
gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_1
gotoroom room_3 room_1 green_door_1
gotoempty
drop red_ball_1 room_1
gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1
pick blue_box_1 room_1
gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3
gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1
gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_3
gotoempty
drop blue_box_1 room_3
gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_3
pick yellow_box_1 room_3
gotodoor red_door_2 room_3 room_4
toggle red_door_2
gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_2
gotoempty
drop yellow_box_1 room_4
gotodoor red_door_2 room_4 room_3
gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_2
gotoobject blue_box_1 room_3
pick blue_box_1 room_3
gotodoor red_door_2 room_3 room_4
gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_2
gotoempty
drop blue_box_1 room_4
gotodoor red_door_2 room_4 room_3
toggle red_door_2
gotoempty
gotodoor red_door_2 room_4 room_3
toggle red_door_2
gotodoor red_door_2 room_3 room_4
```
Hmm, step 41 says "Go in front of red_door_2 in room_3" but we were already in room_4. I don't think we can go in front of red_door_2 in room_3 without first going to room_3. We need to use `gotoroom` first. So let's update step 41:

41. Go to room_3 from room_4 using red_door_2.
42. Go in front of red_door_2 in room_3 (satisfying the goal).

Let's update our formatted plan:

```
gotoobject green_box_1 room_2
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_1
toggle grey_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_1 grey_door_1
gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3
toggle green_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1
gotoobject red_ball_1 room_3
pick red_ball_1 room_3
gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_1
gotoroom room_3 room_1 green_door_1
gotoempty
drop red_ball_1 room_1
gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1
pick blue_box_1 room_1
gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3
gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1
gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_3
gotoempty
drop blue_box_1 room_3
gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_3
pick yellow_box_1 room_3
gotodoor red_door_2 room_3 room_4
toggle red_door_2
gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_2
gotoempty
drop yellow_box_1 room_4
gotodoor red_door_2 room_4 room_3
gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_2
gotoobject blue_box_1 room_3
pick blue_box_1 room_3
gotodoor red_door_2 room_3 room_4
gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_2
gotoempty
drop blue_box_1 room_4
gotodoor red_door_2 room_4 room_3
toggle red_door_2
gotoempty
gotodoor red_door_2 room_4 room_3
toggle red_door_2
gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_2
gotodoor red_door_2 room_3 room_4
```

Actually, I'm overcomplicating things. If the goal is to be in front of an unlocked red_door_2, then I don't necessarily need to be in room_3; I could also be in room_4. If I'm in room_4 in front of red_door_2 and it's unlocked, that should satisfy the goal. Let's revisit the goal:

Goal: "There is a door d such that 'The following conditions are all true: "d is red", "room_3 and room_4 are connected via d", "you are in front of d", "d is not locked""

So the goal is satisfied if I'm in front of an unlocked red_door_2, regardless of whether I'm in room_3 or room_4. This simplifies the plan.

Revised Plan:
1. Go in front of green_box_1 in room_2 (to satisfy constraint 9).
2. Go in front of grey_door_1 in room_2.
3. Toggle grey_door_1 to unlock it.
4. Go to room_1 from room_2 using grey_door_1.
5. Go in front of green_door_1 in room_1.
6. Toggle green_door_1 to unlock it.
7. Go to room_3 from room_1 using green_door_1.
8. Go in front of red_ball_1 in room_3.
9. Pick up red_ball_1 in room_3.
10. Go in front of green_door_1 in room_3.
11. Go to room_1 from room_3 using green_door_1.
12. Go in front of empty.
13. Drop red_ball_1 in room_1 (to satisfy constraint 11).
14. Go in front of blue_box_1 in room_1.
15. Pick up blue_box_1 in room_1.
16. Go in front of green_door_1 in room_1.
17. Go to room_3 from room_1 using green_door_1.
18. Go in front of yellow_box_1 in room_3.
19. Go in front of empty.
20. Drop blue_box_1 in room_3.
21. Go in front of yellow_box_1 in room_3.
22. Pick up yellow_box_1 in room_3 (to satisfy constraint 2).
23. Go in front of red_door_2 in room_3.
24. Toggle red_door_2 to unlock it (to satisfy constraint 10).
25. Go to room_4 from room_3 using red_door_2 (satisfying constraint 1).
26. Go in front of empty.
27. Drop yellow_box_1 in room_4.
28. Go in front of red_door_2 in room_4.
29. Go to room_3 from room_4 using red_door_2.
30. Go in front of blue_box_1 in room_3.
31. Pick up blue_box_1 in room_3.
32. Go in front of red_door_2 in room_3.
33. Go to room_4 from room_3 using red_door_2.
34. Go in front of empty.
35. Drop blue_box_1 in room_4 (satisfying constraint 3).
36. Go in front of red_door_2 in room_4.
37. Toggle red_door_2 to lock it (satisfying constraint 6).
38. Go in front of empty (satisfying constraint 5 and constraint 7).
39. Go in front of red_door_2 in room_4.
40. Toggle red_door_2 to unlock it.
41. This step isn't needed and can be removed. We're already in front of red_door_2 and it's unlocked, so the goal is satisfied.

Ok let's update our formatted plan for the last time:

```
gotoobject green_box_1 room_2
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_1
toggle grey_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_1 grey_door_1
gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3
toggle green_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1
gotoobject red_ball_1 room_3
pick red_ball_1 room_3
gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_1
gotoroom room_3 room_1 green_door_1
gotoempty
drop red_ball_1 room_1
gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1
pick blue_box_1 room_1
gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3
gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1
gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_3
gotoempty
drop blue_box_1 room_3
gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_3
pick yellow_box_1 room_3
gotodoor red_door_2 room_3 room_4
toggle red_door_2
gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_2
gotoempty
drop yellow_box_1 room_4
gotodoor red_door_2 room_4 room_3
gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_2
gotoobject blue_box_1 room_3
pick blue_box_1 room_3
gotodoor red_door_2 room_3 room_4
gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_2
gotoempty
drop blue_box_1 room_4
gotodoor red_door_2 room_4 room_3
toggle red_door_2
gotoempty
gotodoor red_door_2 room_4 room_3
toggle red_door_2
```

This should satisfy all the constraints and the goal.
