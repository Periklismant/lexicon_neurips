Alright, so I need to plan my actions to navigate a 2D gridworld and satisfy a specific goal, which is to be in room_3, in front of the grey box (grey_box_1).

Let me first understand the environment:
- 4 rooms arranged in a square formation: room_1 (NW), room_2 (SW), room_3 (NE), room_4 (SE).
- 4 doors connecting the rooms: 
  - green_door_1 connects room_1 and room_2
  - red_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3
  - purple_door_1 connects room_2 and room_4
  - blue_door_1 connects room_3 and room_4
- Various boxes and balls with different colors.
- Initial position: I am in room_2 and all doors are locked.

Now, let me understand the goal: I need to be in room_3, in front of the grey box (grey_box_1). grey_box_1 is initially in room_3.

Additionally, there are several constraints that I need to abide by. Let me analyze these constraints:

1. At some point, either purple_door_1 must be unlocked or I must be in front of purple_door_1.
2. At some point, I must be holding yellow_box_1.
3. At some point, I must be in front of blue_ball_1.
4. At some point, red_door_1 must be locked.
5. If red_door_1 is locked in a state, then I must be holding some object in that state or in a subsequent state.
6. At some point, I must be in room_1.
7. If I am in room_1, then there must be a previous state where I'm holding yellow_ball_1 and in front of yellow_box_2.
8. At some point, red_door_1 must be unlocked.
9. If red_door_1 is unlocked, then there must be a previous state where I'm in room_4 and green_box_1 is in room_4.
10. At some point, I must be in room_2.
11. If I am in room_2, then blue_door_1 must be unlocked in that state or in a subsequent state.

These constraints impose a certain order on my actions and the states I have to go through. Let me try to summarize the implications:

To reach room_3 with grey_box_1, I need to unlock red_door_1 first (constraint 8). But to unlock red_door_1, I need to first be in room_4 with green_box_1 (constraint 9).

To get to room_4, I need to unlock purple_door_1 (constraint 1).

Also, at some point, I need to be in room_1 (constraint 6). But to get to room_1, I need to first be holding yellow_ball_1 and in front of yellow_box_2 (constraint 7).

And if I'm in room_2, I need to ensure blue_door_1 is unlocked (constraint 11).

Let me sketch a possible plan: Start in room_2, pick up yellow_ball_1, go to room_4 through purple_door_1, bring green_box_1 to room_4, unlock red_door_1, go to room_3, and stand in front of grey_box_1.

That ensures constraints 1, 8, 9, 10, 11. However, I'm not sure how to handle the rest yet. Let me continue planning.

Initial state: I'm in room_2, not holding anything.

First, I need to go in front of yellow_ball_1 (which is in room_2) and pick it up.
```
gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2
pick yellow_ball_1 room_2
```

Then, I need to go to yellow_box_2 (which is in room_4). But to get to room_4, I need to go through purple_door_1, which is locked. So, I need to unlock it first.
```
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_4
toggle purple_door_1
```

Now, I can go to room_4 (satisfying constraint 1).
```
gotoroom room_2 room_4 purple_door_1
```

I need to go in front of yellow_box_2 to satisfy constraint 7.
```
gotoobject yellow_box_2 room_4
```

Now, I need to bring green_box_1 to room_4. But green_box_1 is in room_2, and I'm in room_4. Also, I'm holding yellow_ball_1. I need to drop yellow_ball_1, go back to room_2, pick up green_box_1, and bring it to room_4.

I need to first find an empty spot to drop yellow_ball_1.
```
gotoempty
drop yellow_ball_1 room_4
```

Now, I go back to room_2 to pick up green_box_1.
```
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_2
gotoroom room_4 room_2 purple_door_1
gotoobject green_box_1 room_2
pick green_box_1 room_2
```

I need to go back to room_4 with green_box_1.
```
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_4
gotoroom room_2 room_4 purple_door_1
```

Now, I'm in room_4 with green_box_1 (satisfying constraint 9). I need to unlock red_door_1.
```
gotoempty
drop green_box_1 room_4
```

I need to first go to the door connecting room_1 and room_3 (which is red_door_1). However, I'm in room_4, and the red_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3. I need to find a path to reach this door.

I could go to room_3 through blue_door_1, but it's locked. I need to unlock it first.
```
gotodoor blue_door_1 room_4 room_3
toggle blue_door_1
```

Now, I can go to room_3 (satisfying constraint 11, since I'm using blue_door_1 after being in room_2 earlier).
```
gotoroom room_4 room_3 blue_door_1
```

From room_3, I can go to the red_door_1.
```
gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1
toggle red_door_1
```

Now, red_door_1 is unlocked (satisfying constraint 8).

Wait, I need to figure out how to satisfy constraint 7. I need to be holding yellow_ball_1 and in front of yellow_box_2 before I go to room_1. But I've already gone to room_3 and unlocked red_door_1.

Let me rethink this. Constraint 7 says that if I am in room_1, then there must be an earlier state where I'm holding yellow_ball_1 and in front of yellow_box_2. So I need to ensure this occurs before I enter room_1.

Wait, I'm not sure I can even satisfy all these constraints easily. Let me re-analyze and try a different approach.

Constraint 9 says that red_door_1 must be unlocked at some point, and if red_door_1 is unlocked, then there must be a previous state where I'm in room_4 and green_box_1 is in room_4. Thus, I need to first bring green_box_1 to room_4 before unlocking red_door_1.

Constraint 7 says that if I am in room_1, then there must be a previous state where I'm holding yellow_ball_1 and in front of yellow_box_2. Thus, I need to be in such a state before entering room_1.

Constraint 11 says that if I am in room_2, then blue_door_1 must be unlocked in that state or in a subsequent state. I'm initially in room_2, so I need to unlock blue_door_1 at some point.

Let me try to replan:

Initial state: I'm in room_2, not holding anything.

1. First, I need to go in front of blue_ball_1 (satisfying constraint 3).
```
gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_2
```

2. Now, I need to go to the purple door to satisfy constraint 1.
```
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_4
toggle purple_door_1
```

3. I need to go to room_4 to bring green_box_1 there.
```
gotoroom room_2 room_4 purple_door_1
```

4. I need to go back to room_2 to pick up green_box_1.
```
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_2
gotoroom room_4 room_2 purple_door_1
gotoobject green_box_1 room_2
pick green_box_1 room_2
```

5. I need to go back to room_4 with green_box_1.
```
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_4
gotoroom room_2 room_4 purple_door_1
gotoempty
drop green_box_1 room_4
```

6. Now, I need to unlock blue_door_1 (to satisfy constraint 11).
```
gotodoor blue_door_1 room_4 room_3
toggle blue_door_1
```

Hmm, I realize there's a potential conflict: I need to go to room_1 (constraint 6), but before I go to room_1, I need to satisfy constraint 7 (holding yellow_ball_1 and in front of yellow_box_2). But yellow_box_2 is in room_4 and yellow_ball_1 is in room_2.

Let me continue and see if I can resolve this:

7. I need to go back to room_2 to get yellow_ball_1.
```
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_2
gotoroom room_4 room_2 purple_door_1
gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2
pick yellow_ball_1 room_2
```

8. Now, I need to go back to room_4 to be in front of yellow_box_2 while holding yellow_ball_1.
```
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_4
gotoroom room_2 room_4 purple_door_1
gotoobject yellow_box_2 room_4
```

Now, I'm in front of yellow_box_2 while holding yellow_ball_1. This satisfies the condition in constraint 7 prior to going to room_1. But I need to get to room_1.

To get to room_1, I need to pass through either room_2 or room_3. But to go through room_3, I need to unlock red_door_1, which connects room_1 and room_3. And to unlock red_door_1, I need to be in a position adjacent to it. For that, I could go to room_3 from room_4.

9. I'll first go to room_3 (blue_door_1 is already unlocked).
```
gotodoor blue_door_1 room_4 room_3
gotoroom room_4 room_3 blue_door_1
```

But here's another constraint: Constraint 4 says red_door_1 must be locked at some point, and constraint 5 says that if red_door_1 is locked, I must be holding an object (which I am, yellow_ball_1). Let's continue:

10. I can check if red_door_1 is locked (it is locked initially, so that satisfies constraint 4) and now I'm holding yellow_ball_1 (satisfying constraint 5).

11. Now, I need to unlock red_door_1 (to satisfy constraint 8).
```
gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1
toggle red_door_1
```

12. I can now go to room_1 (satisfying constraint 6).
```
gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1
```

13. I now need to unlock green_door_1 to get back to room_2 (where I started, to satisfy constraint 10).
```
gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_2
toggle green_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_2 green_door_1
```

14. I've now satisfied constraint 10 (being in room_2). I need to satisfy constraint 2 (holding yellow_box_1).

Wait, I'm already holding yellow_ball_1. I need to drop it first before I can pick up yellow_box_1.

Hmm, I'm not sure if I'm satisfying all constraints in the right order. Let me check if I'm missing anything:

Constraint 1: Purple_door_1 must be unlocked or I must be in front of it. I've done this.
Constraint 2: I must hold yellow_box_1 at some point. I haven't done this yet.
Constraint 3: I must be in front of blue_ball_1 at some point. I've done this.
Constraint 4: Red_door_1 must be locked at some point. It was initially locked, so this is satisfied.
Constraint 5: If red_door_1 is locked, I must be holding some object in that state or in a later state. I'm holding yellow_ball_1 after checking that red_door_1 is locked.
Constraint 6: I must be in room_1 at some point. I've done this.
Constraint 7: If I'm in room_1, then there must be a previous state where I'm holding yellow_ball_1 and in front of yellow_box_2. I've done this.
Constraint 8: Red_door_1 must be unlocked at some point. I've done this.
Constraint 9: If red_door_1 is unlocked, then there must be a previous state where I'm in room_4 and green_box_1 is in room_4. I've done this.
Constraint 10: I must be in room_2 at some point. I'm initially in room_2, so this is satisfied.
Constraint 11: If I'm in room_2, then blue_door_1 must be unlocked in that state or in a later state. I've unlocked blue_door_1.

It looks like I haven't satisfied constraint 2 yet. I need to hold yellow_box_1 at some point. Yellow_box_1 is in room_1.

15. I need to go back to room_1 to pick up yellow_box_1.
```
gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_1
gotoroom room_2 room_1 green_door_1
```

16. I need to drop yellow_ball_1 before I pick up yellow_box_1.
```
gotoempty
drop yellow_ball_1 room_1
```

17. I can pick up yellow_box_1.
```
gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_1
pick yellow_box_1 room_1
```

Now, I've satisfied constraint 2 (holding yellow_box_1). My goal is to be in room_3 in front of the grey box. So I need to go back to room_3.

18. I'll go back to room_3 through red_door_1 (which is already unlocked).
```
gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3
gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1
```

19. I need to drop yellow_box_1 before I can go in front of grey_box_1.
```
gotoempty
drop yellow_box_1 room_3
```

20. Finally, I can go in front of grey_box_1.
```
gotoobject grey_box_1 room_3
```

Now, I'm in room_3 in front of grey_box_1, which is the goal.

Let me double-check that all the constraints have been satisfied:

Constraint 1: Purple_door_1 must be unlocked or I must be in front of it. I've done this.
Constraint 2: I must hold yellow_box_1 at some point. I've done this.
Constraint 3: I must be in front of blue_ball_1 at some point. I've done this.
Constraint 4: Red_door_1 must be locked at some point. It was initially locked, so this is satisfied.
Constraint 5: If red_door_1 is locked, I must be holding some object in that state or in a later state. I was holding yellow_ball_1 after checking that red_door_1 is locked.
Constraint 6: I must be in room_1 at some point. I've done this.
Constraint 7: If I'm in room_1, then there must be a previous state where I'm holding yellow_ball_1 and in front of yellow_box_2. I've done this.
Constraint 8: Red_door_1 must be unlocked at some point. I've done this.
Constraint 9: If red_door_1 is unlocked, then there must be a previous state where I'm in room_4 and green_box_1 is in room_4. I've done this.
Constraint 10: I must be in room_2 at some point. I was initially in room_2, so this is satisfied.
Constraint 11: If I'm in room_2, then blue_door_1 must be unlocked in that state or in a later state. I've unlocked blue_door_1.

All constraints have been satisfied. Let me provide the full plan:

1. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_2
2. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_4
3. toggle purple_door_1
4. gotoroom room_2 room_4 purple_door_1
5. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_2
6. gotoroom room_4 room_2 purple_door_1
7. gotoobject green_box_1 room_2
8. pick green_box_1 room_2
9. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_4
10. gotoroom room_2 room_4 purple_door_1
11. gotoempty
12. drop green_box_1 room_4
13. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_4 room_3
14. toggle blue_door_1
15. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_2
16. gotoroom room_4 room_2 purple_door_1
17. gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2
18. pick yellow_ball_1 room_2
19. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_4
20. gotoroom room_2 room_4 purple_door_1
21. gotoobject yellow_box_2 room_4
22. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_4 room_3
23. gotoroom room_4 room_3 blue_door_1
24. gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1
25. toggle red_door_1
26. gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1
27. gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_2
28. toggle green_door_1
29. gotoroom room_1 room_2 green_door_1
30. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_1
31. gotoroom room_2 room_1 green_door_1
32. gotoempty
33. drop yellow_ball_1 room_1
34. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_1
35. pick yellow_box_1 room_1
36. gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3
37. gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1
38. gotoempty
39. drop yellow_box_1 room_3
40. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_3

This looks like a valid plan, but let me double-check one more time to ensure all the actions are valid and all constraints are satisfied.

Actually, I've been misunderstanding the constraints a bit. Let me revisit them:

Constraint 7 says that if I am in room_1, then there must be a previous state where I'm holding yellow_ball_1 and in front of yellow_box_2. This means the state of "holding yellow_ball_1 and in front of yellow_box_2" must occur chronologically before the state of "being in room_1".

In my plan, I have:
19. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_4
20. gotoroom room_2 room_4 purple_door_1
21. gotoobject yellow_box_2 room_4

And then, I hold yellow_ball_1 and I'm in front of yellow_box_2 in room_4. Later, after steps 22-26, I'm in room_1. So this satisfies constraint 7.

Constraint 9 says that if red_door_1 is unlocked, then there must be a previous state where I'm in room_4 and green_box_1 is in room_4. This means the state of "being in room_4 with green_box_1" must occur chronologically before the state of "red_door_1 is unlocked".

In my plan, I have:
11. gotoempty
12. drop green_box_1 room_4

So green_box_1 is in room_4 and I'm in room_4 at this point. Later, after steps 13-24, I unlock red_door_1. So this satisfies constraint 9.

The other constraints are more straightforward and I believe I've satisfied them all. Let me provide the final plan:

1. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_2
2. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_4
3. toggle purple_door_1
4. gotoroom room_2 room_4 purple_door_1
5. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_2
6. gotoroom room_4 room_2 purple_door_1
7. gotoobject green_box_1 room_2
8. pick green_box_1 room_2
9. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_4
10. gotoroom room_2 room_4 purple_door_1
11. gotoempty
12. drop green_box_1 room_4
13. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_4 room_3
14. toggle blue_door_1
15. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_2
16. gotoroom room_4 room_2 purple_door_1
17. gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2
18. pick yellow_ball_1 room_2
19. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_4
20. gotoroom room_2 room_4 purple_door_1
21. gotoobject yellow_box_2 room_4
22. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_4 room_3
23. gotoroom room_4 room_3 blue_door_1
24. gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1
25. toggle red_door_1
26. gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1
27. gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_2
28. toggle green_door_1
29. gotoroom room_1 room_2 green_door_1
30. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_1
31. gotoroom room_2 room_1 green_door_1
32. gotoempty
33. drop yellow_ball_1 room_1
34. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_1
35. pick yellow_box_1 room_1
36. gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3
37. gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1
38. gotoempty
39. drop yellow_box_1 room_3
40. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_3
