Okay, let's try to figure out this planning problem. The goal is to end up in room_3 in front of a grey box that's also in room_3. The initial state has me in room_2, and the grey_box_1 is in room_3. So, I need to get to room_3 and be in front of that box. But there are a bunch of constraints to satisfy along the way. Let me break down each constraint and see how they affect the plan.

First, the constraints:

1. At least once, purple_door_1 must be unlocked or I must be in front of it.
2. At least once, I must be holding an object, specifically yellow_box_1.
3. At least once, I must be in front of blue_ball_1.
4. At least once, red_door_1 must be locked.
5. If red_door_1 is ever locked, then I must be holding something at that state or later.
6. At least once, I must be in room_1.
7. If I'm in room_1, there must be a prior state where I was holding yellow_ball_1 and in front of yellow_box_2. But wait, yellow_box_2 is in room_4. So to be in front of it, I need to go to room_4. But how?
8. At least once, red_door_1 must be unlocked.
9. If red_door_1 is unlocked, then before that, I must have been in room_4 with green_box_1 there. Green_box_1 is initially in room_2. So I need to move it to room_4.
10. At least once, I must be in room_2.
11. If I'm in room_2 at any point, then blue_door_1 must be unlocked at that state or later. Blue_door_1 connects room_3 and room_4. Initially, all doors are locked, so I need to unlock blue_door_1 eventually.

Starting from room_2. The doors are all locked. So first, I need to unlock doors to move around. Let's see the doors:

- green_door_1 connects room_1 and room_2. Locked.
- red_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3. Locked.
- purple_door_1 connects room_2 and room_4. Locked.
- blue_door_1 connects room_3 and room_4. Locked.

To unlock a door, I need to be in front of it and toggle it. But to get in front of a door, I need to be in a room connected by that door, and there's no object blocking the position in front of the door.

Looking at the initial positions of objects:

In room_2: green_box_1, yellow_ball_1, blue_ball_1. So if these are blocking any doors? The doors connected to room_2 are green_door_1 (to room_1) and purple_door_1 (to room_4). So if any of the objects in room_2 are in front of these doors, they would block them. But the problem states don't mention any objects blocking doors. Wait, the preconditions for gotodoor require that there's no object blocking the position in front of the door. But the initial state doesn't say any objects are blocking doors. So perhaps the doors are not blocked initially. So maybe I can go to the doors directly.

But wait, the initial state doesn't specify that any objects are blocking doors, so maybe they are not. So perhaps I can approach the doors in room_2 (green_door_1 and purple_door_1) even though there are objects in the room. The objects are in the room but not necessarily blocking the door positions. So assuming that, I can go to the door.

But first, I need to unlock doors to move. Let's think about the steps.

The main goal is to get to room_3. But how? Starting in room_2. The doors to room_1 (green_door_1) and room_4 (purple_door_1) are locked. To unlock them, I need to toggle them. So perhaps first, go to green_door_1 in room_2, toggle it to unlock. Then go to room_1. But why would I go to room_1? Because one of the constraints requires that I be in room_1 at some point. Also, the seventh constraint says that if I'm in room_1, there must have been a prior state where I was holding yellow_ball_1 and in front of yellow_box_2. But yellow_box_2 is in room_4. So this seems tricky. How can I be in front of yellow_box_2 in room_4 before entering room_1? Because to get to room_4 from room_2, I need to go through purple_door_1, which is locked. So maybe I need to first unlock purple_door_1.

Wait, let's list the constraints in order of dependencies:

- Constraint 7: If in room_1, then prior state must have held yellow_ball_1 and been in front of yellow_box_2 (which is in room_4). So to get to room_1, I must have previously been in front of yellow_box_2 in room_4. But to get to room_4 from room_2, I need to go through purple_door_1. Which is locked. So first, unlock purple_door_1.

But how? To unlock purple_door_1, I need to be in front of it. So in room_2, go to purple_door_1 (room_2 and room_4 are connected via purple_door_1). So:

Action: gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_4 (precondition: in room connected by the door, which room_2 is, and no object blocking. Assuming no blocking, this is possible. Then toggle it. So:

1. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_4
2. toggle purple_door_1 (unlocks it)

Then, I can go to room_4 via purple_door_1.

3. gotoroom room_2 room_4 purple_door_1

Now in room_4. There's green_box_2 and yellow_box_2 here. The yellow_box_2 is needed for constraint 7. So to satisfy that constraint, I need to be in front of yellow_box_2 while holding yellow_ball_1. But yellow_ball_1 is in room_2. So I need to bring it to room_4. Wait, but how? Let's backtrack.

Wait, the constraint says that when I'm in room_1, there must have been a prior state where I was holding yellow_ball_1 and in front of yellow_box_2. So before entering room_1, I must have done that. So perhaps the sequence is: go to room_4, get yellow_ball_1 from room_2, bring it to room_4, drop it, then go to room_1. But that seems complicated. Wait, maybe I can pick up yellow_ball_1 in room_2 first, then go to room_4, be in front of yellow_box_2, then proceed.

Alternatively, maybe the plan involves:

- From room_2, pick up yellow_ball_1.

But to pick it up, I need to be in front of it. So:

1. gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2
2. pick yellow_ball_1 room_2

Now holding yellow_ball_1. Then, go to purple_door_1 (already unlocked?), but initially, all doors are locked, so need to unlock purple_door_1 first.

Wait, initial state has all doors locked. So to unlock purple_door_1, I need to be in front of it. So:

1. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_4
2. toggle purple_door_1 (unlocks it)
3. gotoroom room_2 room_4 purple_door_1 (now in room_4)
4. gotoobject yellow_box_2 room_4
5. drop yellow_ball_1 room_4 (but why? Because after step 3, I'm in room_4. But I need to be in front of yellow_box_2 while holding yellow_ball_1. Wait, maybe:

Wait, after step 3, I'm in room_4. To be in front of yellow_box_2, which is in room_4, I can:

4. gotoobject yellow_box_2 room_4 (so now in front of it)
But I'm holding yellow_ball_1. So this satisfies the condition for constraint 7: holding yellow_ball_1 and in front of yellow_box_2. Then, perhaps later when I go to room_1, this prior state exists.

But then I need to go to room_1. How? From room_4, the connected rooms are room_2 (via purple_door_1) and room_3 (via blue_door_1). To get to room_1, maybe need to go through room_2 to room_1 via green_door_1. But green_door_1 is initially locked. So need to unlock that as well.

Wait, but room_1 is connected to room_2 via green_door_1, and to room_3 via red_door_1. So from room_2, I can go to room_1 once green_door_1 is unlocked.

But let's think step by step.

Current position after step 3: in room_4. Holding yellow_ball_1? No, because step 2 was toggle, then step 3 is moving. Wait, initial steps:

Wait, initial steps would be:

1. In room_2. Need to unlock purple_door_1.

Action: gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_4

Then toggle it. So:

1. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_4
2. toggle purple_door_1 (now unlocked)
3. gotoroom room_2 room_4 purple_door_1 (now in room_4)

Now in room_4. The yellow_box_2 is here. To satisfy constraint 7, I need to be holding yellow_ball_1 and in front of yellow_box_2. But yellow_ball_1 is in room_2. So I need to get it. But I'm in room_4 now. So perhaps I need to go back to room_2, pick up yellow_ball_1, then come back to room_4.

So:

4. gotoroom room_4 room_2 purple_door_1 (back to room_2)
5. gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2
6. pick yellow_ball_1 room_2 (now holding it)
7. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_4
8. toggle purple_door_1 (already unlocked, so locks it again? Wait, but we need to keep it unlocked to move. Wait, but after step 2, it's unlocked. Then after step 3, we are in room_4. Then step 4, going back to room_2. The door was unlocked, so we can pass through. So steps 7 and 8 might not be needed. Wait, after step 3, door is unlocked. So when returning from room_4 to room_2 (step4), the door is still unlocked. So no need to toggle again.

Wait, the door's state after toggling: if it was locked, toggle unlocks it. If unlocked, toggle locks it. So after step 2, purple_door_1 is unlocked. Then step3: move through to room_4. Then step4: move back to room_2 through the same door, which is still unlocked. So no need to toggle again. So steps 7 and 8 are not needed.

So after step4 (back in room_2), holding yellow_ball_1 from step6. Then:

7. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_4 (again, but door is unlocked)
8. gotoroom room_2 room_4 purple_door_1 (now in room4 again)
9. gotoobject yellow_box_2 room4 (now in front of it)
So at this point, I'm holding yellow_ball_1 and in front of yellow_box_2. This satisfies the condition for constraint7. Then later, when I go to room_1, this prior state exists.

But how to get to room_1? From room4, can I go to room3 via blue_door_1? But blue_door_1 is locked. So need to unlock it.

But blue_door_1 connects room3 and room4. To unlock it, I need to be in front of it from either room3 or room4. So if I'm in room4, go to blue_door_1 (room4 and room3), then toggle it. But initially, blue_door_1 is locked. So steps:

10. gotodoor blue_door_1 room4 room3
11. toggle blue_door_1 (unlocks it)
12. gotoroom room4 room3 blue_door_1 (now in room3)
But the goal is to be in room3 in front of grey_box_1. But let's see. If I'm in room3 now, I can go to grey_box_1 and be in front of it. But the goal requires that "you are in room_3", "you are in front of v" (v is grey and in room3). So grey_box_1 is in room3. So:

13. gotoobject grey_box_1 room3
14. (now in front of it) but the goal requires that I am in room3 and in front of grey_box_1. So perhaps after step13, that's done. But the agent is in room3, in front of grey_box_1. So the goal is achieved. But need to check all constraints.

But wait, let's check all constraints. Let's list them again:

1. At least once: purple_door_1 unlocked or in front of it. We were in front of it when we toggled it (step1), and it's unlocked. So that's satisfied.

2. At least once holding yellow_box_1. Wait, no. The constraint says holding some object and specifically yellow_box_1. Wait, constraint2 is: "The following conditions are all true: you are holding some object, you are holding yellow_box_1". So need to hold yellow_box_1 at least once. But in the current steps, we picked up yellow_ball_1, not yellow_box_1. So this is a problem. So we need to hold yellow_box_1 at some point. But yellow_box_1 is in room_1. So how to get it?

This complicates things. So the plan needs to include picking up yellow_box_1. But yellow_box_1 is in room_1. To get to room_1, we need to go through green_door_1 (room2 to room1) or red_door_1 (room1 to room3). But green_door_1 is locked initially. So need to unlock it.

So let's adjust the plan. After step4 (back in room2), perhaps go to green_door_1, unlock it, then go to room1 to get yellow_box_1.

Let's try:

After step6 (holding yellow_ball_1 in room2):

7. gotodoor green_door_1 room2 room1
8. toggle green_door_1 (unlock)
9. gotoroom room2 room1 green_door_1 (now in room1)
10. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room1
11. pick yellow_box_1 room1 (now holding it)
But this would satisfy constraint2 (holding yellow_box_1). Then drop it later if needed.

But after this, we need to get back to room4 to be in front of yellow_box_2 while holding yellow_ball_1. But now we're holding yellow_box_1 instead of yellow_ball_1. So this complicates things.

Alternatively, maybe we can pick up yellow_box_1 after dealing with the other constraints. But let's see. The constraints require:

- Constraint2: must hold yellow_box_1 and some object (since it's "you are holding some object" and "you are holding yellow_box_1". So that's redundant, but anyway, we need to hold it at least once.

- Constraint5: if red_door_1 is locked in any state, then we must be holding something at that state or later. Initially, red_door_1 is locked. So in the initial state, since we're not holding anything, this would violate unless we unlock it or ensure that when it's locked (initially), we hold something later.

Wait, the initial state has red_door_1 locked. So according to constraint5, in that state (s0), we must hold something at s0 or later. But in s0, we are not holding anything. So the plan must ensure that after s0, we hold something. So we have to pick up an object at some point, which we do when picking yellow_ball_1. So that's satisfied as long as we pick up something eventually. Which we do.

But back to constraint2: need to hold yellow_box_1. So we have to get to room1, pick it up.

So after unlocking green_door_1, go to room1, pick up yellow_box_1.

But how does that fit into the plan?

Let me try to outline a possible plan:

Start in room2.

1. gotodoor purple_door_1 room2 room4
2. toggle purple_door_1 (unlock)
3. gotoroom room2 room4 purple_door_1 (now in room4)
4. gotoobject yellow_box_2 room4
5. (need to be holding yellow_ball_1 here to satisfy constraint7 later when entering room1)
But yellow_ball_1 is in room2. So perhaps:

Return to room2.

6. gotoroom room4 room2 purple_door_1 (back to room2)
7. gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room2
8. pick yellow_ball_1 room2 (now holding it)
9. gotodoor purple_door_1 room2 room4
10. gotoroom room2 room4 purple_door_1 (now in room4)
11. gotoobject yellow_box_2 room4 (now in front of it, holding yellow_ball_1. This satisfies the prior state needed for constraint7 when we later go to room1.)

Now, to go to room1, need to unlock green_door_1 (connects room2 and room1). So:

12. gotoroom room4 room2 purple_door_1 (back to room2)
13. gotodoor green_door_1 room2 room1
14. toggle green_door_1 (unlock)
15. gotoroom room2 room1 green_door_1 (now in room1)
16. (Now in room1. This satisfies constraint6: must be in room1 at least once. Also, constraint7 is satisfied because prior to entering room1 (step15), in step11, we were holding yellow_ball_1 and in front of yellow_box_2 in room4.)

But we need to pick up yellow_box_1 in room1 to satisfy constraint2. So:

17. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room1
18. pick yellow_box_1 room1 (now holding it. This satisfies constraint2.)

But now we need to handle other constraints. For example, constraint8 says that if red_door_1 is unlocked, there must be a prior state where we are in room4 and green_box_1 is in room4. Green_box_1 is initially in room2. So to get it to room4, we need to pick it up in room2 and drop it in room4.

But when are we in room4? Steps3, 10, etc. But green_box_1 is in room2. So:

Need to pick up green_box_1 from room2 and drop it in room4.

But after step18, we're in room1 holding yellow_box_1. To get back to room2, use green_door_1 (unlocked):

19. gotoroom room1 room2 green_door_1 (back to room2)
20. drop yellow_box_1 room2 (but why? Maybe not necessary. Alternatively, proceed to pick up green_box_1.

But to pick up green_box_1, we need to be in room2 and not holding anything. Currently holding yellow_box_1. So need to drop it first.

20. gotoempty (in room2)
21. drop yellow_box_1 room2
22. gotoobject green_box_1 room2
23. pick green_box_1 room2 (now holding it)
24. gotodoor purple_door_1 room2 room4
25. gotoroom room2 room4 purple_door_1 (now in room4)
26. drop green_box_1 room4 (now green_box_1 is in room4. This would satisfy the condition for constraint9: if red_door_1 is unlocked, then before that, we were in room4 and green_box_1 is there.)

But when do we unlock red_door_1? Red_door_1 connects room1 and room3. To unlock it, we need to be in room1 or room3 and in front of it.

But red_door_1 is locked initially. We need to unlock it at some point, but according to constraint8, if red_door_1 is ever unlocked, then before that, we were in room4 with green_box_1 there. So after step26, green_box_1 is in room4. So if we then unlock red_door_1, that's okay.

So let's say after step26, we need to go to room1 or room3 to unlock red_door_1.

But currently in room4. To get to room1, need to go back to room2, then to room1.

Alternatively, go from room4 to room3 via blue_door_1 (which is locked). So need to unlock blue_door_1.

So after step26 in room4:

27. gotodoor blue_door_1 room4 room3
28. toggle blue_door_1 (unlock)
29. gotoroom room4 room3 blue_door_1 (now in room3)

Now in room3. Can go to red_door_1 from room3's side.

30. gotodoor red_door_1 room3 room1
31. toggle red_door_1 (unlock it)

Now red_door_1 is unlocked. According to constraint8, unlocking red_door_1 requires that before that, we were in room4 with green_box_1 there. Which was done in step26. So that's satisfied.

But constraint4 requires that red_door_1 is locked at least once. Initially, it's locked, so that's already satisfied. But also, the constraint8 says that if red_door_1 is unlocked, then prior state must have green_box_1 in room4. Which we have.

Now, from room3, we can go to room1 via red_door_1.

32. gotoroom room3 room1 red_door_1 (now in room1)

But why? Maybe to reach other areas. But our goal is to be in room3 in front of grey_box_1. So perhaps after step29 (in room3), we can go to grey_box_1.

Wait, after step29, we are in room3. The grey_box_1 is in room3. So:

30. gotoobject grey_box_1 room3 (now in front of it)
But also need to be in room3, which we are. So this would satisfy the goal. But let's check.

Wait, the goal is: "There is a box v such that v is grey, in room_3, you are in room_3, and in front of v". So if we are in room3 and in front of grey_box_1, that's achieved.

But let's check the steps. After step29, we are in room3. Then step30: gotoobject grey_box_1 room3. Now in front of it. So steps29 and 30 would achieve the goal.

But during these steps, need to ensure all constraints are met.

Let's check all constraints:

1. Purple_door_1 unlocked or in front of it: yes, step1 and step2 involve being in front of purple_door_1 and toggling it (unlocking), so condition holds.

2. Holding yellow_box_1: step18 picks it up. So yes.

3. In front of blue_ball_1: blue_ball_1 is in room2. So during the plan, need to be in front of it. When? For example, after initial steps, maybe goto blue_ball_1 in room2.

But in the current steps, when do we go in front of blue_ball_1? Let's see. We start in room2. Blue_ball_1 is there. If we go to it before moving elsewhere. For example, after step0 (start), maybe:

Step0: you are in room2.

But initial steps were:

1. gotodoor purple_door_1 room2 room4
2. toggle purple_door_1
3. gotoroom room2 room4 purple_door_1
...
But in this path, we didn't go in front of blue_ball_1. So we need to include that. So, to satisfy constraint3, we need to have a state where we are in front of blue_ball_1. So perhaps after step0, before moving to purple_door_1, go to blue_ball_1.

Let me adjust the steps:

1. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room2 (now in front of it)
2. gotodoor purple_door_1 room2 room4
3. toggle purple_door_1
4. gotoroom room2 room4 purple_door_1
... (proceed as before)

This way, step1 satisfies constraint3.

Now, let's rework the steps with this addition:

Revised steps:

1. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room2 (satisfies constraint3)
2. gotodoor purple_door_1 room2 room4
3. toggle purple_door_1 (unlock)
4. gotoroom room2 room4 purple_door_1 (room4)
5. gotoobject yellow_box_2 room4
6. gotoroom room4 room2 purple_door_1 (back to room2)
7. gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room2
8. pick yellow_ball_1 room2 (holding it)
9. gotodoor purple_door_1 room2 room4
10. gotoroom room2 room4 purple_door_1 (room4)
11. gotoobject yellow_box_2 room4 (now in front of it, holding yellow_ball_1)
12. gotoroom room4 room2 purple_door_1 (back to room2)
13. gotodoor green_door_1 room2 room1
14. toggle green_door_1 (unlock)
15. gotoroom room2 room1 green_door_1 (room1)
16. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room1
17. pick yellow_box_1 room1 (satisfies constraint2)
18. gotoroom room1 room2 green_door_1 (back to room2)
19. gotoempty room2 (assuming possible)
20. drop yellow_box_1 room2
21. gotoobject green_box_1 room2
22. pick green_box_1 room2 (now holding it)
23. gotodoor purple_door_1 room2 room4
24. gotoroom room2 room4 purple_door_1 (room4)
25. drop green_box_1 room4 (now green_box_1 is here)
26. gotodoor blue_door_1 room4 room3
27. toggle blue_door_1 (unlock)
28. gotoroom room4 room3 blue_door_1 (room3)
29. gotoobject grey_box_1 room3 (goal achieved)
30. (check if any other constraints)

Now check constraint8: if red_door_1 is not locked (which we need to do to unlock it), then prior state must be in room4 with green_box_1 there. But in this plan, we have not unlocked red_door_1. But constraint8 says that red_door_1 must be unlocked at least once (constraint8 is: "The following expression must hold in at least one state: red_door_1 is not locked"). So we need to unlock red_door_1.

So after step25 (green_box_1 is in room4), we need to unlock red_door_1. But red_door_1 connects room1 and room3. To unlock it, need to be in front of it from either room1 or room3.

But in the current steps, after step25 (room4), we go to room3 via blue_door_1 (steps26-28). Then in room3, we can go to red_door_1.

So insert steps:

28. gotodoor red_door_1 room3 room1
29. toggle red_door_1 (unlock it)
30. Now red_door_1 is unlocked. This satisfies constraint8 (red_door_1 is not locked) and constraint4 (red_door_1 must be locked at least once). But initially, red_door_1 is locked, so constraint4 is satisfied. Now, after unlocking, red_door_1 is not locked, so constraint8 is satisfied.

But according to constraint5: if red_door_1 is locked in some state s, then holding something at s or after. Initially locked, so in s0, need to hold something later. Which we do (step8, step17, etc.)

But also, when we toggle red_door_1 to unlock it (step29), that changes its state from locked to unlocked. So constraint8 is satisfied.

Now, after step29, proceed to goto grey_box_1.

31. gotoobject grey_box_1 room3 (goal achieved)

But let's check all constraints again:

1. Purple_door_1: steps2 and3, so satisfied.

2. Hold yellow_box_1: step17.

3. In front of blue_ball_1: step1.

4. red_door_1 locked at least once: initially yes.

5. If red_door_1 is locked (as in initial state), then we must hold something after. Yes, step8 and others.

6. Be in room1: step15.

7. If in room1 (step15), prior state must have held yellow_ball_1 and in front of yellow_box_2. That's step11 (holding yellow_ball_1 and in front of yellow_box_2 in room4 before step15).

8. red_door_1 not locked (step29).

9. If red_door_1 is not locked (step29), then prior state (step25) has green_box_1 in room4 and we were in room4. Yes.

10. Be in room2: steps6,18, etc.

11. If in room2 (multiple times), then blue_door_1 must be unlocked at or after. Blue_door_1 is unlocked in step27. So when in room2 after step27, that's satisfied. For example, step18 is in room2 after blue_door_1 is unlocked, so that's okay.

So all constraints are satisfied.

Now, the final steps would be:

After step31, the agent is in room3 in front of grey_box_1, which meets the goal.

So the plan would include all these steps. But need to check if there's a shorter path. For example, do we need to drop green_box_1 in room4? Yes, to satisfy constraint9. Also, need to toggle red_door_1 to unlock it (step29), which is required by constraint8.

But let's count the steps. It's quite long, but needs to satisfy all constraints. Let's list the actions:

1. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room2
2. gotodoor purple_door_1 room2 room4
3. toggle purple_door_1
4. gotoroom room2 room4 purple_door_1
5. gotoobject yellow_box_2 room4
6. gotoroom room4 room2 purple_door_1
7. gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room2
8. pick yellow_ball_1 room2
9. gotodoor purple_door_1 room2 room4
10. gotoroom room2 room4 purple_door_1
11. gotoobject yellow_box_2 room4
12. gotoroom room4 room2 purple_door_1
13. gotodoor green_door_1 room2 room1
14. toggle green_door_1
15. gotoroom room2 room1 green_door_1
16. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room1
17. pick yellow_box_1 room1
18. gotoroom room1 room2 green_door_1
19. gotoempty room2
20. drop yellow_box_1 room2
21. gotoobject green_box_1 room2
22. pick green_box_1 room2
23. gotodoor purple_door_1 room2 room4
24. gotoroom room2 room4 purple_door_1
25. drop green_box_1 room4
26. gotodoor blue_door_1 room4 room3
27. toggle blue_door_1
28. gotoroom room4 room3 blue_door_1
29. gotodoor red_door_1 room3 room1
30. toggle red_door_1
31. gotoobject grey_box_1 room3

But wait, after step30 (toggle red_door_1), we're in room3, in front of red_door_1. To get to grey_box_1, need to gotoobject.

So step31: gotoobject grey_box_1 room3.

That's the final action.

This plan seems to cover all constraints. Let's check if there's redundancy. For example, steps19-20: dropping yellow_box_1 in room2 to pick up green_box_1. Necessary because you can't carry two objects. So that's required.

Is there a shorter way? For instance, after step17 (holding yellow_box_1), instead of dropping it, perhaps go directly to room2, then to room4 with yellow_box_1, but then you need to drop it to pick green_box_1. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps carry yellow_box_1 to room4, drop it there, then pick green_box_1. But that would require more steps.

Alternatively, after step17, pick green_box_1 in room2. But you can't pick up green_box_1 while holding yellow_box_1. So must drop first.

So the current plan is probably optimal given the constraints.
