Okay, let's see. I need to find a plan that gets me to room_3, in front of a grey box that's in room_3. The initial state is that I'm in room_2. So first, I need to figure out how to get from room_2 to room_3. Let me check the doors.

Looking at the doors, the connections are:

- room_1 and room_2 are connected via green_door_1 (but that's locked initially).
- room_1 and room_3 via red_door_1 (also locked).
- room_2 and room_4 via purple_door_1 (locked).
- room_3 and room_4 via blue_door_1 (locked).

All doors are locked at the start. So I need to unlock doors to move between rooms. But wait, how do I unlock them? The toggle action can unlock a door if I'm in front of it. But to get in front of a door, I need to go to it. But the doors are locked, so maybe the doors are blocked by objects? Wait, the precondition for "gotodoor" is that there's no object blocking the position in front of the door in the current room. So if a door is blocked by an object in the room I'm in, I can't go to it. But in the initial state, where are the objects?

In room_2, there's green_box_1, yellow_ball_1, and blue_ball_1. So if any of these are blocking the doors in room_2, I can't go to those doors. The doors connected to room_2 are green_door_1 (connects to room_1) and purple_door_1 (connects to room_4). Are any objects blocking those doors? The problem statement doesn't mention which objects are blocking doors, except when an object is in front of a door. Wait, the effect of dropping an object is that it's placed in the room, but the only mention of blocking is in the pick action's effect: if the object was blocking a door, it's no longer blocking. So maybe objects can block doors if they are placed in front of them. But the initial state doesn't say any objects are blocking doors. So maybe all doors are not blocked initially. Wait, the initial state doesn't mention any objects blocking doors. So perhaps in the initial state, doors are not blocked. Therefore, I can go to any door in my current room.

Wait, but the problem says that "goto door" requires that there's no object blocking the position in front of d in the current room. Since the initial state doesn't mention any objects blocking doors, maybe all doors are accessible. So in room_2, I can go to green_door_1 (which connects to room_1) and purple_door_1 (connects to room_4). But since all doors are locked, I need to unlock them first.

So the plan would involve moving to a door, toggling it to unlock, then moving through. But to get to room_3 from room_2, the possible path would be room_2 → room_1 via green_door_1, then room_1 → room_3 via red_door_1. Alternatively, room_2 → room_4 via purple_door_1, then room_4 → room_3 via blue_door_1. Let's see which path is shorter.

But first, let's check what's needed. The goal is to have a grey box (v) in room_3, and I'm in room_3 in front of it. The initial state has grey_box_1 in room_3. So that's already in room_3. So the goal is already satisfied in part, except that I need to be in room_3 and in front of grey_box_1. So the steps would be:

1. Get to room_3.
2. Go to grey_box_1 in room_3.

So the main challenge is getting from room_2 to room_3.

Looking at the connections: From room_2, the available doors are green_door_1 (to room_1) and purple_door_1 (to room_4). Both doors are locked. So first, I need to unlock one of these doors. Let's see which path is possible.

Option 1: Unlock green_door_1 (in room_2), go to room_1, then unlock red_door_1 (in room_1), go to room_3.

Option 2: Unlock purple_door_1 (in room_2), go to room_4, then unlock blue_door_1 (in room_4), go to room_3.

Which is shorter? Let's count steps.

Option 1:

- goto door green_door_1 room_2 room_1
- toggle green_door_1 (unlock)
- gotoroom room_2 room_1 green_door_1 (now in room_1)
- goto door red_door_1 room_1 room_3
- toggle red_door_1 (unlock)
- gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1 (now in room_3)
- gotoobject grey_box_1 room_3

Total steps: 6.

Option 2:

- goto door purple_door_1 room_2 room_4
- toggle purple_door_1 (unlock)
- gotoroom room_2 room_4 purple_door_1 (now in room_4)
- goto door blue_door_1 room_4 room_3
- toggle blue_door_1 (unlock)
- gotoroom room_4 room_3 blue_door_1 (now in room_3)
- gotoobject grey_box_1 room_3

Also 6 steps. But maybe there's a shorter path. Wait, what if there's a way to unlock a door that's in another room? But no, because to toggle a door, you have to be in front of it, which requires being in a room connected by that door. So each door can only be toggled from one of the two rooms it connects.

Alternatively, is there a way to get to room_3 without unlocking both doors? For example, if a door is already unlocked, but in the initial state all doors are locked. So no.

But wait, the initial state says all doors are locked. So regardless of the path, I have to unlock two doors to get from room_2 to room_3. So both options take 6 steps.

But maybe there's a way to carry an object that can help. Wait, the problem doesn't mention any constraints except the ones in the task. The constraints are not given here. Wait, the user provided the problem and the constraints. Wait, in the problem description, after the original state, the task is to bring about a situation where there's a grey box in room_3, I'm in room_3, in front of it. The constraints are not listed here, but the user mentioned that the plan must abide by the following constraints. Wait, looking back:

"A valid plan for the abovementioned problem must abide by the following constraints:"

But the user didn't list any constraints. Wait, maybe that's a mistake. Wait, looking at the original input, the user wrote:

"A valid plan for the abovementioned problem must abide by the following constraints:"

But then there's nothing after. So perhaps the user forgot to include the constraints, but in the problem description. Wait, the initial problem statement says:

"Provided a planning problem, consisting of an initial state of the world, a final goal and a set of constraints, your task is to provide a valid sequence of actions that solves the planning problem, i.e., bringing about the goal of the problem while satisfying all constraints."

But in the given problem, after the initial state and the goal, the constraints are missing. Hmm. Wait, looking again at the user's input, the section after the original state says:

The task is to bring about the following situation:
	"There is a box v such that "The following conditions are all true: "v is grey", "v is in room_3", "you are in room_3", "you are in front of v"""

A valid plan for the abovementioned problem must abide by the following constraints:

But there are no constraints listed. So perhaps there's a formatting error here. Maybe the user intended to include constraints but forgot. Alternatively, maybe the constraints are part of the problem but were omitted. Without knowing the constraints, I have to assume that the only constraints are the preconditions of the actions. So the plan must just achieve the goal while following the action preconditions.

In that case, the problem is to get to room_3, in front of the grey_box_1, which is already in room_3. So the main steps are:

1. Move from room_2 to room_3.
2. Once in room_3, go to grey_box_1.

But how to get to room_3. Let's see. The doors from room_2 are green_door_1 (to room_1) and purple_door_1 (to room_4). So from room_2, I can go through either of those doors once unlocked.

If I take the path through room_1:

- Unlock green_door_1 (in room_2).
- Go to room_1.
- Unlock red_door_1 (in room_1).
- Go to room_3.
- Then gotoobject grey_box_1.

Alternatively, through room_4:

- Unlock purple_door_1 (room_2 to room_4).
- Go to room_4.
- Unlock blue_door_1 (room_4 to room_3).
- Go to room_3.
- Then gotoobject grey_box_1.

Both paths require unlocking two doors. Which is better? Let's count the steps.

Path 1 (via room_1):

1. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_1
2. toggle green_door_1
3. gotoroom room_2 room_1 green_door_1
4. gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3
5. toggle red_door_1
6. gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1
7. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_3

That's 7 actions.

Path 2 (via room_4):

1. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_4
2. toggle purple_door_1
3. gotoroom room_2 room_4 purple_door_1
4. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_4 room_3
5. toggle blue_door_1
6. gotoroom room_4 room_3 blue_door_1
7. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_3

Also 7 actions. So both paths have the same length. But perhaps there's a way to optimize further.

Wait, but when moving through a door, after gotoroom, you're in front of nothing. So after arriving in room_3, I need to go to the grey_box_1. So step 7 is necessary.

But maybe there's a way to combine steps. Let me check the preconditions again.

Wait, after arriving in a new room, you're no longer in front of any object. So after arriving in room_3, you need to gotoobject grey_box_1.

But grey_box_1 is already in room_3. So steps are necessary.

Is there a shorter path? Let's think. What if I can use a different door? For example, from room_2 to room_4, unlock purple_door_1, then go to room_4, unlock blue_door_1, go to room_3. Then gotoobject. That's 7 steps. Same as before.

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to unlock doors in a different order. But I don't think so. All doors are initially locked, so each door needs to be toggled once to unlock.

Wait, the toggle action unlocks if locked, locks if unlocked. So toggling a door that's locked will unlock it. So each door needs to be toggled once to unlock.

So both paths require the same number of steps.

But let's check if any doors are blocked by objects. For example, in room_2, the green_door_1 and purple_door_1. Are any objects blocking their positions? The initial state doesn't mention any objects blocking doors. So I can assume that I can go to those doors.

So either path is possible.

But perhaps the grey_box_1 is already in room_3, so no need to move it. So the plan is just to get to room_3 and be in front of it.

So whichever path is shorter. Both are the same.

So either path would work. Let's pick the first path through room_1.

But wait, in the initial state, room_1 has yellow_box_1. So when I go to room_1, I can ignore that.

So the plan steps:

1. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_1
2. toggle green_door_1
3. gotoroom room_2 room_1 green_door_1
4. gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3
5. toggle red_door_1
6. gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1
7. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_3

But wait, in step 1, gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_1. The gotodoor action's syntax is "gotodoor d r1 r2", where you are in r1. So in room_2, gotodoor green_door_1 (which connects room_2 and room_1). So that's correct.

After step 3, I'm in room_1. Then step 4 is gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3. Then toggle, then go to room_3. Then gotoobject.

Yes, that seems correct.

Alternatively, the other path would be:

1. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_4
2. toggle purple_door_1
3. gotoroom room_2 room_4 purple_door_1
4. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_4 room_3
5. toggle blue_door_1
6. gotoroom room_4 room_3 blue_door_1
7. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_3

Either way, seven steps.

But maybe there's a way to reduce steps. Let's think again.

Wait, when you perform gotoroom, you end up in the new room and are no longer in front of anything. So after arriving in room_3 via gotoroom, you need to gotoobject.

But the grey_box_1 is already in room_3. So the last step is necessary.

Alternatively, can I combine some steps? For example, after unlocking a door, can I go through it immediately without moving to another door?

Wait, after toggling a door, you're in front of it. So when you toggle green_door_1 in room_2, you are in front of it, then you can use gotoroom to move through it. So the steps are:

1. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_1
2. toggle green_door_1 (now unlocked)
3. gotoroom room_2 room_1 green_door_1 (now in room_1, not in front of anything)
4. gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3
5. toggle red_door_1
6. gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1 (now in room_3)
7. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_3

Yes, same as before.

Alternatively, is there a way to use a different door from room_2 to room_3? But according to the initial connections, room_2 is connected to room_1 and room_4. So no direct door from room_2 to room_3.

Thus, the minimal plan is 7 actions. Both paths are the same length. So either is acceptable.

Now, to write the plan. Let's choose the path through room_1 and room_3.

So the plan is:

```
gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_1
toggle green_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_1 green_door_1
gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3
toggle red_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1
gotoobject grey_box_1 room_3
```

Each action on a separate line, enclosed by triple backticks.
