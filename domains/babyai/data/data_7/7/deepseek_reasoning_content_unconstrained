Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. The goal is to get to a blue door that's unlocked and be in front of it. Let's start by understanding the initial state and the available actions.

First, the agent starts in room_4. The doors in the problem are purple_door_1 (connects room_1 and room_2), blue_door_1 (connects room_1 and room_3), grey_door_1 (connects room_2 and room_4), and purple_door_2 (connects room_3 and room_4). All doors are initially locked. The blue door is blue_door_1 between room_1 and room_3. So the target door is blue_door_1, but it's locked. The agent needs to unlock it and then be in front of it.

But how to get there? The agent is in room_4. The doors from room_4 are grey_door_1 to room_2 and purple_door_2 to room_3. Both are locked. So first, the agent needs to unlock one of these doors to move to another room.

Looking at the objects in each room, room_2 has a grey_box_1 and purple_ball_1. Room_3 has purple_ball_2 and blue_ball_1. Room_4 has grey_ball_2. The boxes and balls have colors. The doors require keys of their color. Wait, but the problem doesn't mention keys. Oh, right, the toggle action can unlock a door if you are in front of it. But to toggle a door, you need to be in front of it. However, the doors are initially locked, so the agent can't go through them unless they are unlocked. But how to get to a door that's locked? Because to go in front of a door, you have to be in a room connected by that door, and there's no object blocking the position in front of the door.

Wait, the preconditions for "gotodoor d r1 r2" are: you are in a room connected by d, and no object is blocking the position in front of d in your current room. So even if the door is locked, you can go in front of it as long as there's no object blocking. Then, once in front of it, you can toggle it (unlock it). But then you can use the door to move between rooms.

So the agent is in room_4. The doors from room_4 are grey_door_1 (connects to room_2) and purple_door_2 (connects to room_3). Both are locked. Let's check if there's any object blocking the front of these doors in room_4. The initial state doesn't mention any objects blocking doors. The only object in room_4 is grey_ball_2. Unless the ball is in front of the door. But the initial state doesn't specify positions, only which room objects are in. So maybe the doors are not blocked. So the agent can go to the door in room_4, say purple_door_2 (connecting to room_3), but since it's locked, the agent can't go through yet. Wait, but to go to the door, the agent just needs to be in the same room as the door's connection. Wait, the "gotodoor d r1 r2" action requires that the agent is in a room (r1 or r2) connected by door d, and that there's no object blocking the front of d in the current room.

So in room_4, the doors are grey_door_1 (room_2 and room_4) and purple_door_2 (room_3 and room_4). So the agent can go to grey_door_1 from room_4, provided there's no object blocking. Since grey_ball_2 is in room_4, but unless it's in front of the door, it's not blocking. Assuming that objects are not blocking doors unless specified, maybe the agent can go to the door. Then, once in front of the door, toggle it (unlock it). Then, use gotoroom to move to the connected room.

But the target is to unlock a blue door. The blue door is blue_door_1, which connects room_1 and room_3. So the agent needs to get to blue_door_1, unlock it, and be in front of it. But how to reach blue_door_1?

Path from room_4 to room_1: Possible routes? Let's see. From room_4, possible doors are grey_door_1 (room_2) and purple_door_2 (room_3). Both are locked. So first, the agent needs to unlock one of them. Let's try unlocking purple_door_2 first. Because room_3 has purple_door_2 connected to room_4. So agent is in room_4. They can go to purple_door_2 (gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_3). Then toggle it to unlock. Then go to room_3 via purple_door_2. Then in room_3, the doors are blue_door_1 (connects to room_1) and purple_door_2 (connects to room_4). Blue_door_1 is locked. So the agent would need to unlock blue_door_1. But to do that, they need to be in front of blue_door_1. But blue_door_1 is in room_1 and room_3. So from room_3, the agent can go to blue_door_1 (gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_1). But blue_door_1 is locked. So agent can go in front of it (if there's no object blocking in room_3), then toggle to unlock it. Then they can go through blue_door_1 to room_1. But the goal is to have a blue door (blue_door_1) that's unlocked and be in front of it. So once the agent unlocks blue_door_1, if they are in front of it, that's the goal.

But how to get to blue_door_1 from room_3? The steps would be:

1. From room_4, go to purple_door_2 (gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_3). But since the door is locked, can they go in front of it? The gotodoor action doesn't require the door to be unlocked, only that they are in a connected room and no object blocks the door's position. So yes.

So:

Action: gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_3

Then toggle it to unlock.

Action: toggle purple_door_2

Now purple_door_2 is unlocked.

Then, go from room_4 to room_3 via purple_door_2.

Action: gotoroom room_4 room_3 purple_door_2

Now in room_3. Next, go to blue_door_1 in room_3.

Action: gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_1

But blue_door_1 is locked. So then toggle it.

Action: toggle blue_door_1

Now blue_door_1 is unlocked. Then, the agent is in front of blue_door_1. So the goal is satisfied: there's a blue door (blue_door_1 is blue), the agent is in front of it, and it's unlocked.

Wait, but the goal is "There is a door d such that d is blue, you are in front of d, and d is not locked". So the plan would be:

1. gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_3
2. toggle purple_door_2
3. gotoroom room_4 room_3 purple_door_2
4. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_1
5. toggle blue_door_1

After step 5, the agent is in front of blue_door_1, which is blue and now unlocked. That meets the goal. Let's check if all preconditions are met.

Step 1: gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_3. The agent is in room_4, which is connected via purple_door_2. Is there any object blocking? The initial objects in room_4 are grey_ball_2. Unless the ball is in front of the door, which isn't stated. So assuming no blocking, this action is possible.

Step 2: toggle purple_door_2. The agent is in front of it, so possible. Now door is unlocked.

Step3: gotoroom room4 to room3 via purple_door_2. Since the door is unlocked, possible. Now in room3.

Step4: gotodoor blue_door_1 in room3. Agent is in room3, which is connected via blue_door_1 to room1. No objects blocking? In room3, there are purple_ball_2 and blue_ball_1. If they are not blocking the door's position, action is allowed. Then step4 is possible.

Step5: toggle blue_door_1. Now it's unlocked. So after this action, blue_door_1 is unlocked, and the agent is in front of it. So the goal is achieved.

But wait, the initial state says that blue_door_1 is locked. So this plan would unlock it, making it not locked, and the agent is in front of it. So this seems correct.

But let's check if there's a shorter plan. What if the agent goes through room_2 instead? Let's see.

From room4, unlock grey_door_1. Then go to room2. From room2, go to room1 via purple_door_1 (but it's locked). So then unlock purple_door_1, which is purple. Then go to room1. Then from room1, go to room3 via blue_door_1 (which is locked). Then unlock it. But that would take more steps. The previous plan is 5 steps, while this path would be longer. So the first plan is better.

Another consideration: the constraints. The problem mentions that the plan must satisfy all constraints. The user didn't list any additional constraints here beyond the preconditions. Wait, the original problem statement says "a set of constraints" but in the provided input, under "A valid plan for the abovementioned problem must abide by the following constraints:", there's nothing listed. Maybe a formatting error. But assuming no extra constraints beyond the preconditions. So the first plan is valid.

So the optimal plan is the 5-step plan as outlined.
