Okay, let me try to work through this planning problem step by step. The goal is to have a blue door that's unlocked, and I need to be in front of it. Also, there are a bunch of constraints I have to satisfy. Let's start by understanding all the requirements and the initial state.

First, the initial state: I'm in room_4. The doors are all locked. The objects are spread out in different rooms. The doors are colored, and the objects have colors too. The constraints are a bit complex, so I need to make sure each one is met in the plan.

The final goal is that there exists a blue door (d) which is not locked, and I'm in front of it. The blue doors in the problem are blue_door_1, which connects room_1 and room_3. So I need to unlock blue_door_1 and be in front of it. But wait, blue_door_1 is between room_1 and room_3. To unlock it, I need to toggle it, which requires being in front of it. But since it's locked initially, I can't move through it until it's unlocked. Hmm.

Wait, the doors are all locked. So how do I move between rooms? Let's check the connections. The doors are purple_door_1 (room_1-room_2), blue_door_1 (room_1-room_3), grey_door_1 (room_2-room_4), and purple_door_2 (room_3-room_4). All are locked. So starting in room_4, the adjacent rooms are room_2 (via grey_door_1) and room_3 (via purple_door_2). Both doors are locked, so initially, I can't leave room_4 unless I unlock one of them. But to unlock a door, I need to be in front of it, which requires being in the same room as the door's position. So, for example, to unlock grey_door_1, I need to be in room_4 (since grey_door_1 connects room_2 and room_4). But wait, if I'm in room_4, then grey_door_1 is in room_4 and room_2. To go to grey_door_1 from room_4, I can use gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_2. But the preconditions for gotodoor are that I'm in a room connected by the door and that there's no object blocking the door's position in the current room.

Looking at the initial state, room_4 has grey_ball_2. If that's blocking the door's position, then I can't go to the door. Wait, the problem states that objects can block door positions. So if there's an object in front of the door in the current room, then you can't go to the door. So in room_4, the grey_door_1 is connected to room_2 and room_4. So in room_4, the position in front of grey_door_1 might be blocked if there's an object there. But in the initial state, grey_ball_2 is in room_4. Is it blocking the door? The problem's initial state doesn't explicitly say that any objects are blocking doors. Wait, the effects of the drop action mention that if an object was blocking a door, then it's no longer blocking. So maybe objects aren't blocking doors unless they are in front of them. But how do objects get in front of doors? When you drop them there. So initially, unless the problem states that an object is in front of a door, they aren't blocking. So in the initial state, none of the doors are blocked, so I can go to them.

So, starting in room_4, I can go to grey_door_1 (since I'm in room_4, which is connected via grey_door_1 to room_2). Then toggle it to unlock. That would allow me to move to room_2 via grey_door_1. But I need to check the constraints. Let's look at the constraints one by one.

Constraints:

1. Must be in room_4 at least once. Since the initial state is room_4, that's covered already.

2. If in room_4 at some state, then must be in room_1 at that state or later. So after being in room_4, eventually reach room_1.

3. At least once, purple_door_2 is not locked. So need to unlock it at some point.

4. If purple_door_2 is unlocked in some state, then in an earlier state, I was in room_3 and holding purple_ball_1.

5. At least once, grey_door_1 is unlocked and I'm holding purple_ball_1.

6. Must be in room_3 at some point.

7. If in room_3, then earlier I was holding grey_box_1 or grey_ball_2 is in room_1.

8. At least once, grey_door_1 is unlocked and holding blue_ball_1.

9. Must be in room_1 at least once.

10. At least once, purple_door_2 is locked.

11. If purple_door_2 is locked in state s, then grey_ball_2 is in room_1 at s or later.

So the plan must include these conditions. Let's try to map out a path.

The final goal is to have a blue door (blue_door_1) unlocked and in front of it. So I need to be in front of blue_door_1, which is in room_1 or room_3. Since blue_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3, to be in front of it, I must be in either room_1 or room_3. Then I can toggle it to unlock.

But how to get there from room_4?

Possible steps:

1. From room_4, unlock grey_door_1 (connecting to room_2) by toggling it. Then go to room_2.

But wait, to unlock grey_door_1, I need to be in front of it. So first, gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_2. Then toggle it. Then gotoroom room_4 room_2 grey_door_1. Now in room_2.

In room_2, there's grey_ball_1, grey_box_1, purple_ball_1.

But how to get to room_1 from room_2? The door is purple_door_1, which is locked. So need to unlock it. To unlock purple_door_1, which connects room_1 and room_2, I need to be in front of it in room_2. So gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1. Then toggle to unlock. Then go to room_1.

But to unlock purple_door_1, I need to be in front of it. So from room_2, goto purple_door_1, toggle it, then go to room_1.

Once in room_1, can get to blue_door_1 (connects to room_3). But blue_door_1 is locked. So need to unlock it. But how? To unlock blue_door_1, I need to be in front of it in room_1. Then toggle. Then go to room_3 via blue_door_1.

But the problem is that the final goal requires being in front of a blue door (blue_door_1) which is unlocked. So perhaps the plan is to unlock blue_door_1 and then be in front of it.

But let's see the constraints.

Also, constraint 4 says that if purple_door_2 is unlocked, then earlier in room_3 and holding purple_ball_1. So purple_door_2 is between room_3 and room_4. So to unlock it, I need to be in room_3 or room_4. But initially, purple_door_2 is locked. So perhaps unlocking it requires being in room_3 or room_4 and in front of it. But why would I need to hold purple_ball_1 in room_3 to unlock purple_door_2?

Wait, constraint 4 is that if purple_door_2 is unlocked, then earlier I was in room_3 holding purple_ball_1. So perhaps to unlock purple_door_2, I need to have had that condition. Maybe purple_door_2 requires some key, which is purple_ball_1. But in this domain, the toggle action only requires being in front of the door. So maybe the constraint is a separate condition, not part of the action's preconditions. So even if the toggle can be done without holding anything, the constraint says that before unlocking purple_door_2, I must have been in room_3 holding purple_ball_1. So I need to arrange that sequence.

Similarly, constraint 5 requires that at some point, grey_door_1 is unlocked and I'm holding purple_ball_1. So after unlocking grey_door_1, I must pick up purple_ball_1 at some point. But where is purple_ball_1? It's in room_2. So maybe after unlocking grey_door_1 and going to room_2, I pick up purple_ball_1.

But let's outline the steps:

Starting in room_4:

1. gotoempty (since I need to move around, but maybe not necessary; but initially, I'm in room_4, and there's grey_ball_2 here. Maybe first goto empty to get in front of an empty spot. But perhaps I can go directly to the door.

Wait, to perform gotodoor, I need to be in a room connected by the door. So from room_4, grey_door_1 connects to room_2 and room_4. So I can goto grey_door_1 in room_4.

So step 1: gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_2.

Then toggle grey_door_1 to unlock it.

Then gotoroom room_4 room_2 grey_door_1. Now in room_2.

Now in room_2, there's grey_ball_1, grey_box_1, purple_ball_1.

Pick up purple_ball_1. But to pick it up, I need to be in front of it. So first, gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_2. Then pick purple_ball_1 room_2. Now holding it.

This satisfies constraint 5 (grey_door_1 is now unlocked, and I'm holding purple_ball_1) if this is after unlocking grey_door_1. So after step 3 (toggle grey_door_1), then step 4 (gotoroom to room_2), then steps to pick up purple_ball_1. So that would satisfy constraint 5.

But then, to meet constraint 4 (if purple_door_2 is unlocked, then earlier in room_3 holding purple_ball_1). So if later I unlock purple_door_2, I need to have been in room_3 holding purple_ball_1 before that. Hmm. So perhaps I need to bring purple_ball_1 to room_3.

But how to get to room_3. Let's think. From room_2, to get to room_1, need to unlock purple_door_1. Then from room_1, go to room_3 via blue_door_1 (which is locked). So need to unlock blue_door_1 as well.

Alternatively, from room_4, there's purple_door_2 connecting to room_3. If I can unlock purple_door_2, then I can go directly from room_4 to room_3. But purple_door_2 is locked. To unlock it, I need to be in front of it. So from room_4, gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_3. Then toggle. But according to constraint 4, if I unlock purple_door_2, I must have previously been in room_3 holding purple_ball_1. But if I unlock purple_door_2 from room_4, then I was never in room_3. So that's a problem. Therefore, unlocking purple_door_2 must be done after I have been in room_3 holding purple_ball_1.

So perhaps the only way to unlock purple_door_2 is from room_3, after having been in room_3 and holding purple_ball_1.

But how to get to room_3? The possible paths are:

From room_1 via blue_door_1 (locked), or from room_4 via purple_door_2 (locked). So initially, the only way to get to room_3 is through room_1 or room_4. But if I'm in room_4, can I go to room_3 via purple_door_2? But it's locked. To unlock it from room_4, I need to be in front of purple_door_2 in room_4, toggle it. But according to constraint 4, that would require having been in room_3 holding purple_ball_1 before unlocking. But if I unlock it from room_4, that's impossible because I haven't been in room_3 yet. Therefore, the only way to unlock purple_door_2 is from room_3. But how to get to room_3?

Alternatively, perhaps the plan requires going through room_1, then room_3.

But let's see: starting in room_4, unlock grey_door_1 (room_4 to room_2), go to room_2. Then unlock purple_door_1 (room_2 to room_1), go to room_1. Then unlock blue_door_1 (room_1 to room_3), go to room_3. Then, in room_3, I need to have purple_ball_1 to satisfy constraint 4 when I unlock purple_door_2. But purple_ball_1 is in room_2. So I need to bring it to room_3. So after picking up purple_ball_1 in room_2, go to room_1 via purple_door_1 (unlocked), then to room_3 via blue_door_1 (unlocked). Then drop purple_ball_1 in room_3. Then, if I need to unlock purple_door_2, which is between room_3 and room_4. But why would I need to unlock it? Maybe to get back to room_4? The final goal is to be in front of blue_door_1, which is in room_1 or room_3. So maybe after unlocking blue_door_1 in room_1, then go to room_3, then be in front of blue_door_1 there. Wait, blue_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3, so being in front of it in room_3 would require being in room_3. So I can unlock blue_door_1 from room_1, then go to room_3, and then goto door blue_door_1 in room_3, then toggle it (but it's already unlocked). Wait, but the goal is to have the door unlocked and be in front of it. So once it's unlocked, just being in front of it in room_3 would satisfy the goal.

But let's make sure all constraints are met.

Let's outline the steps:

1. From room_4, go to grey_door_1 (gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_2).
2. Toggle grey_door_1 (unlock).
3. Go to room_2 (gotoroom room_4 room_2 grey_door_1).
4. In room_2, goto purple_ball_1.
5. Pick purple_ball_1.
6. Now, need to go to room_3. How? From room_2, the only adjacent rooms are room_1 (via purple_door_1) and room_4 (via grey_door_1). So need to go to room_1 first.

7. Go to purple_door_1 in room_2.
8. Toggle purple_door_1 (unlock).
9. Go to room_1 (gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1).
10. Now in room_1. Need to unlock blue_door_1 to get to room_3.
11. Go to blue_door_1 in room_1.
12. Toggle blue_door_1 (unlock).
13. Go to room_3 via blue_door_1.
14. Now in room_3. Here, we need to meet constraint 7: if in room_3, then earlier held grey_box_1 or grey_ball_2 is in room_1. Grey_box_1 is in room_2. So maybe we need to have grey_ball_2 moved to room_1. Grey_ball_2 is initially in room_4. So need to bring it to room_1. But how?

But according to constraint 11: if purple_door_2 is locked in some state, then grey_ball_2 must be in room_1 at that state or later. Also, constraint 10 requires that purple_door_2 is locked at some state. So in the plan, we need to lock purple_door_2 again after unlocking it, or maybe have it locked initially (but it's already locked). Wait, no, constraint 10 says "The following expression must hold in at least one state: "purple_door_2 is locked"". Since initially it's locked, that's already covered. But the problem says "a valid plan for the abovementioned problem must abide by the following constraints". So if the initial state already satisfies some constraints, then that's okay. However, constraint 11 says that if purple_door_2 is locked in any state s (including the initial state), then grey_ball_2 must be in room_1 at s or later. In the initial state, purple_door_2 is locked, and grey_ball_2 is in room_4. So this violates constraint 11 unless in some later state, grey_ball_2 is moved to room_1. Therefore, we need to move grey_ball_2 to room_1 at some point.

So steps to move grey_ball_2 to room_1:

Starting from room_4:

In the initial steps, after moving to room_2, perhaps we can go back to room_4, pick up grey_ball_2, and carry it to room_1. Let's see:

After step 3 (in room_2), steps 4-5 (pick purple_ball_1 in room_2). Then perhaps go back to room_4 via grey_door_1 (already unlocked). Then in room_4, goto grey_ball_2, pick it up, then carry it through rooms to room_1. But that would take a lot of steps. Let's see:

But maybe after step 13 (in room_3), we need to go back to room_4, pick up grey_ball_2, and take it to room_1. But that might complicate things. Alternatively, after step 3 (in room_2), before going to room_1, go back to room_4 to get grey_ball_2.

But let's see:

Alternative path:

After step 3 (in room_2), do:

4. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_4 (but wait, grey_door_1 connects room_2 and room_4, so from room_2, gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_4.

But to go back to room_4, since grey_door_1 is already unlocked, we can go back.

5. gotoempty (to not be in front of anything)
6. gotoroom room_2 room_4 grey_door_1. Now back in room_4.

Then, in room_4, pick up grey_ball_2:

7. gotoobject grey_ball_2 room_4
8. pick grey_ball_2 room_4
9. Then, go to room_2 again via grey_door_1.
10. Then go to room_1 via purple_door_1 (unlock it if needed)
But this seems time-consuming. However, we need to move grey_ball_2 to room_1 to satisfy constraint 11. Because in the initial state, purple_door_2 is locked, and constraint 11 says that if it's locked in any state, then grey_ball_2 must be in room_1 at that state or later. Since the initial state has it locked and grey_ball_2 in room_4, we need to move it to room_1 at some point.

So moving grey_ball_2 to room_1 is necessary.

Let's adjust the plan:

1. goto grey_door_1 in room_4
2. toggle to unlock
3. goto room_2
4. pick purple_ball_1 in room_2
5. go back to room_4 via grey_door_1
6. in room_4, pick grey_ball_2
7. go back to room_2
8. go to room_1 via purple_door_1 (unlock if needed)
9. drop grey_ball_2 in room_1
10. proceed to unlock blue_door_1 and go to room_3

But this adds several steps. Let's check constraints:

- By dropping grey_ball_2 in room_1, constraint 11 is satisfied (whenever purple_door_2 is locked, which it is initially and possibly later, grey_ball_2 is in room_1 after that).

But let's proceed step by step.

But let's think again: the initial state has purple_door_2 locked, so we must have grey_ball_2 in room_1 at some point after the initial state. So moving grey_ball_2 to room_1 is necessary.

So how to do that:

From room_4:

1. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_2
2. toggle grey_door_1 (unlocks it)
3. gotoroom room_4 room_2 grey_door_1 (now in room_2)
4. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_2
5. pick purple_ball_1 room_2 (now holding it)
6. gotoempty (to leave front of object)
7. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_4
8. toggle grey_door_1 (lock it again? But why? Wait, constraint 5 requires that at least once, grey_door_1 is unlocked and holding purple_ball_1. So steps 2-5 satisfy that. Then perhaps step 7 is just moving back to the door.

Wait, after step 3, we are in room_2. Then, after picking purple_ball_1, we can go back to room_4 to get grey_ball_2.

So steps after 5:

6. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_4
7. gotoroom room_2 room_4 grey_door_1 (now in room_4)
8. gotoobject grey_ball_2 room_4
9. pick grey_ball_2 room_4 (now holding it)
10. drop it in room_1. To get to room_1:

From room_4, need to go to room_2 (via grey_door_1, which is unlocked), then room_1 via purple_door_1 (which is locked). So need to unlock purple_door_1.

But purple_door_1 is in room_2, connecting to room_1. So from room_4, back to room_2:

11. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_2
12. toggle grey_door_1 (already unlocked, so this would lock it again. But constraint 8 requires that at some point, grey_door_1 is unlocked and holding blue_ball_1. Wait, constraint 8 says: "The following conditions are all true: grey_door_1 is not locked, you are holding blue_ball_1". So in some state, grey_door_1 is unlocked and I'm holding blue_ball_1. Blue_ball_1 is in room_3. So I need to get blue_ball_1 and have grey_door_1 unlocked at the same time. So perhaps after unlocking grey_door_1, then later, when I have blue_ball_1, grey_door_1 must be unlocked. But if I toggle it again, it would lock, so I need to make sure that when I have blue_ball_1, grey_door_1 is unlocked. So maybe after unlocking grey_door_1 initially, I don't lock it again until after I've fulfilled constraint 8.

So during step 2, grey_door_1 is unlocked. Then, when I go back to room_4 (step 7), grey_door_1 is still unlocked. Then, when I pick up grey_ball_2 and go back to room_2 (step 11), grey_door_1 is still unlocked. Then, need to unlock purple_door_1 in room_2:

13. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1
14. toggle purple_door_1 (unlock)
15. gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1 (now in room_1)
16. drop grey_ball_2 in room_1: gotoempty, then drop grey_ball_2.

Now grey_ball_2 is in room_1, satisfying constraint 11 whenever purple_door_2 is locked (like in the initial state and possibly after if we lock it again).

Then, from room_1, unlock blue_door_1:

17. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_3
18. toggle blue_door_1 (unlock)
19. gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_1 (now in room_3)
20. Now in room_3. Need to satisfy constraint 7: if in room_3, then earlier held grey_box_1 or grey_ball_2 is in room_1. Grey_ball_2 is in room_1, so that's satisfied.

In room_3, we have purple_ball_2 and blue_ball_1. Need to pick up blue_ball_1 to satisfy constraint 8 (grey_door_1 unlocked and holding blue_ball_1). But grey_door_1 is in room_2 and room_4. So to have grey_door_1 unlocked and holding blue_ball_1, I need to be in room_2 or room_4 with grey_door_1 unlocked and holding blue_ball_1.

So steps:

21. In room_3, gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_3
22. pick blue_ball_1 room_3 (now holding it)
23. Now, need to go to a room where grey_door_1 is accessible. For example, go back to room_1, then to room_2, then to room_4.

But to get back to room_1, blue_door_1 is already unlocked. So:

24. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_1
25. gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_1 (back to room_1)
26. From room_1, go to room_2 via purple_door_1 (unlocked)
27. In room_2, go to grey_door_1 (room_2 room_4)
28. Now, check if grey_door_1 is unlocked. Earlier steps: grey_door_1 was unlocked in step 2, then we toggled it again in step 12, which would lock it. Wait, no: step 12 is after step 7. Wait, steps after step 5:

After step 5 (holding purple_ball_1 in room_2), step 6 is gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_4. Step 7 is gotoroom to room_4. Then step 8 is pick grey_ball_2. Then step 11 is gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_2 (which requires being in room_4 and going to grey_door_1). Then step 12 is toggle grey_door_1. But initially, grey_door_1 was unlocked in step 2. Toggling it again would lock it. So step 12 would lock grey_door_1. That's a problem because constraint 8 requires that grey_door_1 is unlocked when holding blue_ball_1.

So perhaps we should not toggle grey_door_1 again in step 12. Instead, after step 7 (returning to room_4), we don't toggle the door again. So when returning to room_4, we just use the door without toggling it, since it's already unlocked.

Wait, the gotoroom action requires that the door is unlocked, but does not change its state. So in step 3, after unlocking grey_door_1, when we go from room_4 to room_2 via grey_door_1, the door remains unlocked. Then in step 7, when returning from room_2 to room_4 via grey_door_1, the door is still unlocked, so we can pass through. No need to toggle again. So steps 6 and 7 would be:

6. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_4
7. gotoroom room_2 room_4 grey_door_1

No toggle needed here, since the door is already unlocked.

So after step 7, grey_door_1 remains unlocked. Then, in room_4, steps 8-9: pick grey_ball_2.

Then, to go back to room_2:

10. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_2
11. gotoroom room_4 room_2 grey_door_1

Now in room_2 again. Then, steps to unlock purple_door_1:

12. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1
13. toggle purple_door_1 (unlock)
14. gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1 (now in room_1)
15. drop grey_ball_2 in room_1 (gotoempty, then drop)

Now, constraint 7 is satisfied when we later go to room_3.

Then, unlock blue_door_1 in room_1:

16. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_3
17. toggle blue_door_1 (unlock)
18. gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_1 (now in room_3)

In room_3, pick up blue_ball_1:

19. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_3
20. pick blue_ball_1 room_3

Now, need to satisfy constraint 8: grey_door_1 unlocked and holding blue_ball_1. Currently, grey_door_1 is unlocked (step 2) and I'm holding blue_ball_1. But I'm in room_3. To get to a position where grey_door_1 is accessible, need to go back to room_4 or room_2. For example, go back to room_1, then room_2.

21. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_1
22. gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_1 (room_1)
23. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2
24. gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1 (room_2)
25. Now in room_2. Then, goto grey_door_1 in room_2.

26. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_4
At this point, I'm in front of grey_door_1 in room_2, which is unlocked. I'm holding blue_ball_1. So this state satisfies constraint 8 (grey_door_1 not locked, holding blue_ball_1). Now, we can proceed.

Then, to satisfy constraint 4: if purple_door_2 is unlocked, then earlier in room_3 holding purple_ball_1. So we need to unlock purple_door_2 at some point. But purple_door_2 connects room_3 and room_4. To unlock it, we need to be in front of it in room_3 or room_4. But if we're in room_3, and purple_door_2 is locked, we need to unlock it. However, the goal requires a blue door (blue_door_1) to be unlocked and in front of it. So maybe after unlocking blue_door_1 and being in front of it, we can achieve the goal.

But let's think about the final steps. After unlocking blue_door_1 in room_1 (step 17), we go to room_3 (step 18). Then, to be in front of blue_door_1 in room_3, we need to goto door blue_door_1 in room_3. Then, toggle it (but it's already unlocked). The goal just requires that the door is unlocked and we're in front of it. So perhaps:

After step 18 (in room_3):

19. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_3 (but already picked up in step 20). So after step 20, we have blue_ball_1.

Wait, maybe after step 20, we can drop it and go to blue_door_1. Let's reorganize:

After step 18 (in room_3), we need to get to blue_door_1 in room_3.

19. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_1
But blue_door_1 connects room_3 and room_1, so in room_3, gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_1.

20. Now in front of blue_door_1 in room_3. The door is unlocked. So this satisfies the goal: there exists a blue door (blue_door_1) that's not locked, and I'm in front of it. So this is the goal state.

So the final actions would be up to step 19:

But let's track all constraints:

- Must visit room_4: done in initial state and when we went back to pick grey_ball_2.

- If in room_4, then be in room_1 later: done.

- purple_door_2 not locked at least once: but in the current plan, we haven't unlocked purple_door_2. So this constraint isn't met. Oh, right! The constraint 3 requires that at least once, purple_door_2 is not locked. Currently, purple_door_2 is locked throughout the plan. So we need to unlock it at least once.

But how? To unlock purple_door_2, we need to be in front of it in room_3 or room_4. If we unlock it from room_3, then according to constraint 4, we need to have been in room_3 holding purple_ball_1 earlier. But in the current plan, purple_ball_1 was picked up in room_2 (step 5) and then carried to room_1 (step 15?), no. Wait, no: after step 5, we had purple_ball_1, then went to room_4 (steps 6-7), then room_2 again (steps 10-11), then room_1 (steps 12-14). When did we drop purple_ball_1? Oh, we never dropped it. So in step 5, we picked up purple_ball_1, then carried it through to room_4, then back to room_2, then room_1. So in room_1, we dropped grey_ball_2 but still holding purple_ball_1. Then when going to room_3 via blue_door_1, we're still holding purple_ball_1. So in room_3, we are holding purple_ball_1 and blue_ball_1? No, because when we pick up blue_ball_1 (step 20), we can't pick it up unless we drop purple_ball_1 first. Because you can't hold two objects. So this is a mistake in the earlier steps.

Wait, the agent can only carry one object at a time. So after picking up purple_ball_1 (step 5), when going to room_4 (step 7), he's still holding it. Then picks up grey_ball_2 (step 8) — but can't, because he's already holding purple_ball_1. So this is a problem.

Ah, right! The pick action requires that you're not holding any object. So after step 5, when we picked up purple_ball_1, we can't pick up grey_ball_2 until we drop it. So this is a mistake in the previous steps. So the plan needs to drop purple_ball_1 before picking up grey_ball_2.

So correcting steps:

After step 5 (holding purple_ball_1 in room_2), to pick up grey_ball_2, we need to drop purple_ball_1 first.

So revised steps:

5. pick purple_ball_1 room_2 (now holding it)
6. drop purple_ball_1 room_2 (but why? Because we need to pick up grey_ball_2 later. But this complicates things. Alternatively, find another way to move grey_ball_2 without dropping purple_ball_1. But perhaps we need to handle both.

This is getting complicated. Let me rethink the plan, ensuring that all constraints are met and actions are possible.

Alternative approach:

The main constraints that complicate things are:

- Need to unlock purple_door_2 at least once, which requires being in room_3 and having held purple_ball_1 earlier.

- Need to move grey_ball_2 to room_1.

- Need to have grey_door_1 unlocked while holding blue_ball_1.

Let's try to tackle purple_door_2 first.

To unlock purple_door_2, I need to be in room_3 or room_4 and in front of it. Let's say I'm in room_3. To unlock it, I need to be in front of purple_door_2 in room_3. But according to constraint 4, before unlocking purple_door_2, I must have been in room_3 holding purple_ball_1. So I need to have held purple_ball_1 while in room_3. But purple_ball_1 is in room_2 initially. So I need to bring it to room_3.

So steps to do that:

From room_2, pick purple_ball_1, go to room_1, then to room_3 via blue_door_1 (unlocked), drop it in room_3. Then, go to purple_door_2 in room_3, toggle to unlock. Then, maybe lock it again to satisfy constraint 10 (purple_door_2 must be locked at least once; but it's already locked initially. So perhaps the initial state satisfies constraint 10, but constraint 11 requires that whenever it's locked, grey_ball_2 is in room_1. Since we moved grey_ball_2 to room_1, that's covered.

So, integrating this into the plan:

1. Start in room_4.

2. Unlock grey_door_1 (from room_4):

   a. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_2

   b. toggle grey_door_1 (now unlocked)

   c. gotoroom room_4 room_2 grey_door_1 (now in room_2)

3. In room_2, pick purple_ball_1:

   a. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_2

   b. pick purple_ball_1 room_2

4. Unlock purple_door_1 (room_2 to room_1):

   a. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1

   b. toggle purple_door_1 (unlock)

   c. gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1 (now in room_1)

5. Unlock blue_door_1 (room_1 to room_3):

   a. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_3

   b. toggle blue_door_1 (unlock)

   c. gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_1 (now in room_3)

6. Drop purple_ball_1 in room_3:

   a. gotoempty (room_3)

   b. drop purple_ball_1 room_3

7. Now, in room_3, need to pick up purple_ball_1 again to satisfy constraint 4 (if we unlock purple_door_2 later, we must have been in room_3 holding purple_ball_1 before).

   a. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_3

   b. pick purple_ball_1 room_3

8. Now, unlock purple_door_2:

   a. gotodoor purple_door_2 room_3 room_4

   b. toggle purple_door_2 (unlock it)

This satisfies constraint 3 (purple_door_2 is not locked at least once) and constraint 4 (before unlocking, was in room_3 holding purple_ball_1).

9. Now, to meet constraint 8: grey_door_1 unlocked and holding blue_ball_1.

   a. Drop purple_ball_1 in room_3.

   b. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_3

   c. pick blue_ball_1 room_3

   d. Now, need to go to grey_door_1 while holding blue_ball_1 and grey_door_1 is unlocked.

   e. Return to room_4 via purple_door_2 (unlocked):

      i. gotodoor purple_door_2 room_3 room_4

      ii. gotoroom room_3 room_4 purple_door_2 (now in room_4)

   f. From room_4, go to grey_door_1:

      i. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_2

      ii. Now in front of grey_door_1, which is unlocked (step 2b)

      iii. At this point, holding blue_ball_1 and grey_door_1 is unlocked: satisfies constraint 8.

10. Now, need to move grey_ball_2 to room_1. Currently, grey_ball_2 is in room_4. So:

   a. gotoobject grey_ball_2 room_4

   b. pick grey_ball_2 room_4 (but already holding blue_ball_1 → need to drop first.)

   c. drop blue_ball_1 room_4

   d. pick grey_ball_2 room_4

   e. Carry it to room_1:

      i. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_2

      ii. gotoroom room_4 room_2 grey_door_1 (room_2)

      iii. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1 (unlocked)

      iv. gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1 (room_1)

      v. drop grey_ball_2 room_1

11. Now, need to go back to room_3 to unlock blue_door_1 and be in front of it.

   a. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_3

   b. gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_1 (room_3)

   c. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_1

   d. Now in front of blue_door_1 in room_3, which is unlocked. This satisfies the goal.

But this seems very long. Let's check if all constraints are met:

- Constraint 1: in room_4 initially. Yes.

- Constraint 2: after room_4, eventually room_1. Yes.

- Constraint 3: purple_door_2 unlocked in step 8b. Yes.

- Constraint 4: before step 8b, in step 7b, was in room_3 holding purple_ball_1. Yes.

- Constraint 5: grey_door_1 unlocked and holding purple_ball_1. This happens in step 2b (grey_door_1 unlocked) and step 3b (holding purple_ball_1 in room_2). But are these concurrent? No. So need to have a state where grey_door_1 is unlocked and holding purple_ball_1. Step 3: after unlocking grey_door_1, in room_2, holding purple_ball_1. But grey_door_1 is in room_2 and room_4. So in room_2, if I'm holding purple_ball_1 and grey_door_1 is unlocked, that satisfies constraint 5.

- Constraint 6: be in room_3. Yes, steps 5c, 6a, etc.

- Constraint 7: when in room_3, earlier held grey_box_1 or grey_ball_2 in room_1. grey_ball_2 is moved to room_1 in step 10e. So when in room_3 (step 5c), grey_ball_2 is not yet in room_1. So this violates constraint 7. So need to ensure that before entering room_3 for the first time, either held grey_box_1 or grey_ball_2 is in room_1.

But in the current plan, first time entering room_3 is step 5c. At that point, grey_ball_2 is still in room_4. So this violates constraint 7. Therefore, we need to ensure that before entering room_3, either we have held grey_box_1 or grey_ball_2 is in room_1.

So how to do that. grey_box_1 is in room_2. So in room_2, pick grey_box_1 and then drop it, but that's not necessary. Alternatively, move grey_ball_2 to room_1 before going to room_3.

So revised plan:

After step 4c (in room_1), we need to move grey_ball_2 to room_1 before proceeding to room_3.

So:

After step 4c (in room_1):

5. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2? No, room_1 is connected to room_2 via purple_door_1.

Wait, room_1 is connected to room_2 via purple_door_1 (already unlocked in step 4b).

So from room_1, go back to room_2:

5. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2

6. gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1 (room_2)

7. In room_2, go to grey_door_1.

8. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_4

9. gotoroom room_2 room_4 grey_door_1 (room_4)

10. pick grey_ball_2 room_4

11. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_2

12. gotoroom room_4 room_2 grey_door_1 (room_2)

13. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1

14. gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1 (room_1)

15. drop grey_ball_2 room_1

Now, grey_ball_2 is in room_1. Now, proceed to unlock blue_door_1 and go to room_3:

16. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_3

17. toggle blue_door_1 (unlock)

18. gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_1 (room_3)

Now, when entering room_3 for the first time (step 18), grey_ball_2 is in room_1, satisfying constraint 7.

Then continue with the previous steps to handle purple_door_2 and blue_ball_1.

This is getting very long, but necessary to meet all constraints.

Finally, the goal is to be in front of a blue door (blue_door_1) which is unlocked. After step 17, blue_door_1 is unlocked. So in room_3, goto blue_door_1:

19. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_1

Now in front of blue_door_1, which is unlocked. This meets the goal.

Now, checking all constraints:

1. In room_4: initial state.

2. If in room_4, then in room_1 later: yes.

3. purple_door_2 unlocked: step 8b (earlier plan) but in this revised plan, need to handle purple_door_2.

Wait, in the current revised plan, we haven't unlocked purple_door_2 yet. So need to add steps to unlock it.

After step 18 (in room_3):

19. pick purple_ball_2 (but no, need to hold purple_ball_1 for constraint 4).

Alternatively, need to bring purple_ball_1 to room_3.

Wait, in the current plan, purple_ball_1 is still in room_2 (step 3b). So after step 3b (picked purple_ball_1 in room_2), then step 4c (room_1), then steps to move grey_ball_2.

But during these steps, purple_ball_1 is being carried. Then in step 15, when dropping grey_ball_2 in room_1, the agent is holding purple_ball_1. So when going to room_3 in step 18, he's still holding purple_ball_1.

Then in room_3:

19. drop purple_ball_1 room_3 (to pick up blue_ball_1 later)

20. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_3

21. pick blue_ball_1 room_3

22. Now, to satisfy constraint 8 (grey_door_1 unlocked and holding blue_ball_1), need to go to grey_door_1 while holding blue_ball_1 and grey_door_1 is unlocked.

23. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_1

24. gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_1 (room_1)

25. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2

26. gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1 (room_2)

27. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_4

28. At this point, grey_door_1 is unlocked (step 2b), and holding blue_ball_1. Satisfies constraint 8.

Then, unlock purple_door_2 to meet constraint 3:

29. return to room_3:

   a. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1

   b. gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1 (room_1)

   c. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_3

   d. gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_1 (room_3)

30. gotodoor purple_door_2 room_3 room_4

31. toggle purple_door_2 (unlock)

Now, constraint 3 is met.

Finally, be in front of blue_door_1:

32. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_1

This satisfies the goal.

This plan seems to meet all constraints, but it's very long. However, considering all the constraints, especially the complex ones involving holding objects and door states, it's necessary.

But the problem asks for an optimal plan, which is the shortest possible. So perhaps there's a shorter path.

Let me try to optimize.

Alternative idea:

After moving grey_ball_2 to room_1, then go to room_3 via blue_door_1. While in room_3, unlock purple_door_2 (after dropping purple_ball_1 there), then go back to room_4 via purple_door_2, then go to room_3 again via purple_door_2, and be in front of blue_door_1.

But I'm not sure. Given the time constraints, I'll proceed to write the step-by-step plan based on the previous reasoning, ensuring all constraints are met.
