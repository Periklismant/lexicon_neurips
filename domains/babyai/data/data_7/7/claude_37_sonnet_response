Alright, I need to understand the initial state of the world, the goal, and the constraints, and then come up with a valid plan to achieve the goal while respecting the constraints.

First, I'll summarize the initial state of the world:
- I am in room_4.
- Various balls and a box are distributed across the rooms.
- There are four locked doors: purple_door_1 (connecting room_1 and room_2), blue_door_1 (connecting room_1 and room_3), grey_door_1 (connecting room_2 and room_4), and purple_door_2 (connecting room_3 and room_4).
- I'm not holding any object.
- I have only visited room_4 so far.

My goal is to reach a state where there's a blue door that I'm in front of and that door is unlocked. The only blue door is blue_door_1 which connects room_1 and room_3.

Let's break down the constraints:
1. I must be in room_4 at some point. (I am already in room_4.)
2. After being in room_4, I must be in room_1 at the same state or later.
3. purple_door_2 must be unlocked at some point.
4. Before purple_door_2 is unlocked, I must be in room_3 and holding purple_ball_1.
5. At some point, grey_door_1 must be unlocked and I must be holding purple_ball_1.
6. I must be in room_3 at some point.
7. Before being in room_3, I must either be holding grey_box_1 or grey_ball_2 must be in room_1.
8. At some point, grey_door_1 must be unlocked and I must be holding blue_ball_1.
9. I must be in room_1 at some point.
10. purple_door_2 must be locked at some point.
11. After purple_door_2 is locked (if it is), grey_ball_2 must be in room_1.

Now, let's formulate a plan:

First, I need to get out of room_4. I can only go to room_2 or room_3, but both doors are locked. 

Since constraint 4 requires me to be in room_3 holding purple_ball_1 (which is currently in room_2) before unlocking purple_door_2, and constraint 7 requires me to be holding grey_box_1 or have grey_ball_2 in room_1 before being in room_3, I need to plan accordingly.

Let's start by planning to move grey_ball_2 to room_1:

1. First, I need to pick up grey_ball_2 in room_4.
2. To get to room_1, I need to go through a series of rooms.
3. Given the initial state, grey_door_1, purple_door_1, and blue_door_1 are all locked. So, I need to unlock some doors.
4. I'll need to unlock purple_door_2 to go from room_4 to room_3, and later unlock blue_door_1 to go from room_3 to room_1.

However, there's a circular dependency:
- To unlock purple_door_2, I need to be in room_3 holding purple_ball_1 (constraint 4).
- To be in room_3, I need to either be holding grey_box_1 or have grey_ball_2 in room_1 (constraint 7).
- To get grey_ball_2 to room_1, I need to be in room_1, which means I need to go through room_3 (since all doors are locked).
- To get to room_3, I need to go through room_4 (which I am already in), but I need to unlock purple_door_2.

But there's another constraint: grey_door_1 must be unlocked while I'm holding purple_ball_1 (constraint 5). This means I need to go to room_2, get purple_ball_1, and then unlock grey_door_1.

Also, I need to unlock grey_door_1 while holding blue_ball_1 (constraint 8). This means I need to go to room_3, get blue_ball_1, and then unlock grey_door_1.

Let's adjust the plan:

First, I need to try starting from what I know I need to do from the goal:
- I need to be in front of blue_door_1 (which connects room_1 and room_3) and unlock it if it's locked.

Working backwards:
- To be in front of blue_door_1, I need to be in either room_1 or room_3.
- From my initial position in room_4, I can go to room_2 (via grey_door_1) or room_3 (via purple_door_2), but both are locked.

Let me consider the constraints:
- Constraint 7 says that before I go to room_3, I must either be holding grey_box_1 or grey_ball_2 must be in room_1.
- Constraint 4 says that before purple_door_2 is unlocked, I must be in room_3 and holding purple_ball_1.
- But to be in room_3 in the first place, I need to go through an unlocked door, which conflicts with the constraint.

Actually, I'm thinking about this wrong. These constraints are not saying that EVERY time I go to room_3, I must satisfy them. They're saying that at SOME point, these conditions must be met.

Let's break the problem down step by step:

1. I am in room_4 and need to reach a state where I'm in front of blue_door_1 and it's unlocked.
2. I need to be in room_1 at some point (constraint 9).
3. After being in room_4, I must be in room_1 (constraint 2).
4. Before being in room_3, I must either be holding grey_box_1 or grey_ball_2 must be in room_1 (constraint 7).
5. At some point, grey_door_1 must be unlocked and I must be holding purple_ball_1 (constraint 5).
6. At some point, grey_door_1 must be unlocked and I must be holding blue_ball_1 (constraint 8).
7. purple_door_2 must be unlocked at some point (constraint 3).
8. Before purple_door_2 is unlocked, I must be in room_3 holding purple_ball_1 (constraint 4).
9. purple_door_2 must be locked at some point (constraint 10).
10. After purple_door_2 is locked, grey_ball_2 must be in room_1 (constraint 11).

Let's figure out how to get from room_4 to the various rooms:
- To get from room_4 to room_3, I need to use purple_door_2 (which is locked).
- To get from room_4 to room_2, I need to use grey_door_1 (which is locked).
- To get from room_2 to room_1, I need to use purple_door_1 (which is locked).
- To get from room_3 to room_1, I need to use blue_door_1 (which is locked).

Now, the question is, how do I unlock any door?

The action "toggle d" allows me to unlock a door if I'm in front of it. So, I need to go in front of a door and toggle it.

Let's try to satisfy the constraints one by one.

Constraint 7 says that before being in room_3, I must either be holding grey_box_1 or grey_ball_2 must be in room_1. In my intiial state, I'm in room_4 and neither of these conditions are met.

If I want to move grey_ball_2 (which is in room_4) to room_1, I need to go from room_4 to room_1 first, which requires passing through either room_2 or room_3 (both of which require unlocked doors).

Meanwhile, grey_box_1 is in room_2, and to pick it up, I need to go from room_4 to room_2, which requires unlocking grey_door_1.

Constraint 4 says that before purple_door_2 is unlocked, I must be in room_3 and holding purple_ball_1. But to be in room_3, I need to use an unlocked door, and the only way from room_4 to room_3 is through purple_door_2 (which is locked).

There seems to be a logical loop. Let's see if there's a way around this.

Let's start by trying to satisfy constraint 7: Before being in room_3, I must either be holding grey_box_1 or grey_ball_2 must be in room_1.

1. I need to pick up grey_ball_2 (which is in room_4).
2. gotoobject grey_ball_2 room_4
3. pick grey_ball_2 room_4

But now, I need to get to room_1 to drop grey_ball_2 there. To get to room_1 from room_4, I need to go through either room_2 or room_3, which requires unlocking a door.

Let's try to unlock grey_door_1 (connecting room_4 and room_2):
4. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_2
5. toggle grey_door_1

Now, I can go to room_2:
6. gotoroom room_4 room_2 grey_door_1

But constraint 5 states that at some point, I need to have grey_door_1 unlocked while holding purple_ball_1. So, let's pick up purple_ball_1 (which is in room_2):
7. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_2
8. pick purple_ball_1 room_2

Now, I satisfy constraint 5 (grey_door_1 is unlocked and I'm holding purple_ball_1). But I'm still holding purple_ball_1, and I need to get grey_ball_2 to room_1 to satisfy constraint 7.

Wait, I misunderstood that constraint. Constraint 7 says that before being in room_3, I must either be holding grey_box_1 OR grey_ball_2 must be in room_1, but it doesn't say I have to satisfy this condition immediately.

Actually, let's re-read constraint 7: "If expression "you are in room_3" holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: "At least one of the following conditions is true: "you are holding grey_box_1", "grey_ball_2 is in room_1"".

Now I understand it better.

Another approach to consider is the following:

1. I'm in room_4 initially.
2. I'll pick up grey_ball_2 from room_4.
3. I'll unlock grey_door_1 to go to room_2.
4. I'll unlock purple_door_1 to go to room_1.
5. I'll drop grey_ball_2 in room_1.
6. Now, grey_ball_2 is in room_1, which means I can go to room_3 (satisfying constraint 7).
7. I need to go back to room_2 to pick up purple_ball_1.
8. Once I have purple_ball_1, I need to go to room_3.
9. Once I'm in room_3 with purple_ball_1, I can unlock purple_door_2 (satisfying constraint 4).
10. I also need to pick up blue_ball_1 from room_3 at some point.
11. I need to go to grey_door_1 with blue_ball_1 (satisfying constraint 8).
12. Finally, I need to be in front of blue_door_1 and unlock it (achieving my goal).

Let's formulate the detailed plan:

Actually, there's another constraint to consider: Constraint 11 states that after purple_door_2 is locked, grey_ball_2 must be in room_1.

So, I need to ensure that grey_ball_2 is in room_1 after locking purple_door_2.

Let's refine the plan:

1. I'm in room_4 initially.
2. I'll pick up grey_ball_2 from room_4.
3. I'll unlock grey_door_1 to go to room_2.
4. I'll drop grey_ball_2 (temporarily) in room_2.
5. I'll pick up purple_ball_1 from room_2.
6. I'll go back to room_4 (satisfying constraint 5: grey_door_1 is unlocked and I'm holding purple_ball_1).
7. I'll lock grey_door_1.
8. I'll unlock purple_door_2 (but this violates constraint 4 because I haven't been in room_3 with purple_ball_1 yet).

Let me rethink the plan.

The circular dependencies in the constraints are making this complex. Let's re-examine:

- Constraint 4: Before purple_door_2 is unlocked, I must be in room_3 holding purple_ball_1.
- Constraint 7: Before being in room_3, I must either be holding grey_box_1 or grey_ball_2 must be in room_1.

To be in room_3, I need to go through purple_door_2 (from room_4) or blue_door_1 (from room_1), both of which are locked.

Let's try a different approach. It doesn't necessarily need to be the case that the very first time I visit room_3, I need to have purple_ball_1. It just means that at some point, I've been in room_3 with purple_ball_1 before I unlock purple_door_2.

So, I can go to room_3, and then later come back to room_3 with purple_ball_1 before unlocking purple_door_2.

Wait, I'm misunderstanding the constraint structure. Constraints 4 and 7 are talking about a conditional: IF A THEN B. The constraints are asserting a condition that needs to be true before a specific event happens.

For constraint 4, before purple_door_2 is unlocked, there must be some state where I've been in room_3 holding purple_ball_1. It's not saying the very first time I unlock purple_door_2, I need to have purple_ball_1.

Let's re-read and reinterpret:

Constraint 4: "If expression "purple_door_2 is not locked" holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: "The following conditions are all true: "you are in room_3", "you are holding purple_ball_1"""

This means that before I unlock purple_door_2, I must have been in room_3 holding purple_ball_1 at some point.

Constraint 7: "If expression "you are in room_3" holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: "At least one of the following conditions is true: "you are holding grey_box_1", "grey_ball_2 is in room_1"""

This means that before I enter room_3, I must either have been holding grey_box_1 or grey_ball_2 must have been in room_1 at some point.

In other words, I can't directly go to room_3 without having met the condition of constraint 7. And I can't unlock purple_door_2 without having been in room_3 holding purple_ball_1.

So, before even thinking about going to room_3, I need to make sure that either I've held grey_box_1 or grey_ball_2 has been in room_1.

Let's revisit the initial state and think this through step by step.

wait, I think I'm not carefully enough understanding the structure of the constraints. The constraints are if-then statements, so they're not always requiring a specific condition to hold; they're only saying that IF a certain condition holds, THEN another condition must have held previously.

Let's go through the constraints again, carefully:

Constraint 4: "If expression "purple_door_2 is not locked" holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which [I've been in room_3 holding purple_ball_1]".

This means that I can't unlock purple_door_2 until I've been in room_3 holding purple_ball_1.

Constraint 7: "If expression "you are in room_3" holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which [I've been holding grey_box_1 OR grey_ball_2 has been in room_1]".

This means that I can't go to room_3 until I've either held grey_box_1 or put grey_ball_2 in room_1.

But there's a circular dependency:
- To go to room_3, I need to have met the condition of constraint 7. But to meet this condition (especially moving grey_ball_2 to room_1), I might need to go through room_3.
- To unlock purple_door_2, I need to have been in room_3 holding purple_ball_1. But to be in room_3, I need to use purple_door_2 (or blue_door_1, which is also locked).

I'm thinking there's a way out of this:

1. I first need to pick up grey_box_1 from room_2, which would satisfy constraint 7. 
2. To get to room_2 from room_4, I need to unlock grey_door_1.
3. After holding grey_box_1, I can go to room_3 (through an unlocked door, which I'll figure out how to get).
4. In room_3, I can drop grey_box_1 and pick up purple_ball_1 from room_2.
5. Then, with purple_ball_1 in hand, I can go back to room_3, which satisfies constraint 4 and allows me to unlock purple_door_2.

Let's check this plan against the initial state and the constraints:

Wait, purple_ball_1 is in room_2. So I'll need to:
1. Go to room_2.
2. Pick up grey_box_1 (to satisfy constraint 7).
3. Go back to room_4.
4. Unlock purple_door_2 (can I? Constraint 4 says I need to have been in room_3 with purple_ball_1, which I haven't done yet).

There's still a circular dependency. I need to break it somehow.

Let's reconsider the state and the constraints:

The initial state says purple_ball_1 is in room_2. So, to satisfy constraint, 4 I need to go from room_2 to room_3 while holding purple_ball_1. But to get from room_2 to room_3, I need to go through either room_1 or room_4, and all the connecting doors are locked.

I need to find a valid order of actions.

Let's try this:
1. I'm in room_4.
2. I'll pick up grey_ball_2.
3. I'll unlock grey_door_1 to go to room_2.
4. I'll pick up grey_box_1 (which satisfies constraint 7, allowing me to go to room_3 later).
5. I'll drop grey_ball_2 in room_2.
6. I'll pick up purple_ball_1 from room_2.
7. Oops, I can't pick up purple_ball_1 while holding grey_box_1. Let me drop grey_box_1, pick up purple_ball_1, and then pick up grey_box_1 again.
   7.1. Drop grey_box_1.
   7.2. Pick up purple_ball_1.
   7.3. I've now satisfied constraint 5 (grey_door_1 is unlocked and I'm holding purple_ball_1).
8. I'll go back to room_4 with purple_ball_1.
9. I'll unlock purple_door_2.
10. Oops, I can't do that yet. Constraint 4 says I need to have been in room_3 holding purple_ball_1 before unlocking purple_door_2.

The circular dependency is still there.

Actually, I think the easiest approach is to ignore some complexities for now and just try to create a plan step by step, making sure each step is valid. Actually, let's first clarify the goal: my goal is to find a blue door that's unlocked and be in front of it. The only blue door is blue_door_1, which connects room_1 and room_3.

Let me start:

I'm in room_4.

Constraint 7 says that before I go to room_3, I must either have been holding grey_box_1 or grey_ball_2 must have been in room_1. So, I need to satisfy one of these conditions.

To get grey_box_1 (which is in room_2), I need to go from room_4 to room_2, which requires unlocking grey_door_1.

1. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_2
2. toggle grey_door_1 (now grey_door_1 is unlocked)
3. gotoroom room_4 room_2 grey_door_1 (now I'm in room_2)

Now, I can pick up grey_box_1 from room_2.

4. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_2
5. pick grey_box_1 room_2 (now I'm holding grey_box_1)

Now, I've satisfied constraint 7 (I'm holding grey_box_1), which means I can go to room_3, but I need an unlocked door to do so.

From room_2, I can go to room_1 via purple_door_1, and then from room_1 to room_3 via blue_door_1. Alternatively, I can go back to room_4 via grey_door_1, and then from room_4 to room_3 via purple_door_2. Both of these routes require unlocking doors.

Let's choose to go from room_2 to room_1 via purple_door_1, and then from room_1 to room_3 via blue_door_1.

6. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1
7. toggle purple_door_1 (now purple_door_1 is unlocked)
8. gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1 (now I'm in room_1)

Now, I'm in room_1 and holding grey_box_1. I've satisfied constraint 9 (I've been in room_1) and constraint 2 (after being in room_4, I've been in room_1). 

To go from room_1 to room_3, I need to unlock blue_door_1.

9. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_3
10. toggle blue_door_1 (now blue_door_1 is unlocked)

Now, I've satisfied the goal if I'm in front of the blue door. But let me continue to satisfy the other constraints.

I want to go to room_3, but I need to drop grey_box_1 first so I can pick up purple_ball_1 later.

11. gotoempty
12. drop grey_box_1 room_1 (now I'm not holding any object)
13. gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_1 (now I'm in room_3)

I've now satisfied constraint 6 (I've been in room_3) and constraint 7 (before being in room_3, I had been holding grey_box_1).

To satisfy constraint 4, I need to be in room_3 holding purple_ball_1 before I unlock purple_door_2. purple_ball_1 is in room_2, so I need to go back to room_2 to get it.

14. gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_1 (now I'm in room_1)
15. gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1 (now I'm in room_2)
16. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_2
17. pick purple_ball_1 room_2 (now I'm holding purple_ball_1)
18. gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1 (now I'm in room_1)
19. gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_1 (now I'm in room_3)

Now, I'm in room_3 and holding purple_ball_1, which means I can satisfy constraint 4 and unlock purple_door_2.

20. gotodoor purple_door_2 room_3 room_4
21. toggle purple_door_2 (now purple_door_2 is unlocked)

I've now satisfied constraint 3 (purple_door_2 is unlocked).

I plan to pick up blue_ball_1 from room_3 to satisfy constraint 8 (grey_door_1 is unlocked and I'm holding blue_ball_1). First, I need to drop purple_ball_1.

22. gotoempty
23. drop purple_ball_1 room_3 (now I'm not holding any object)
24. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_3
25. pick blue_ball_1 room_3 (now I'm holding blue_ball_1)

Now, I need to go to grey_door_1 with blue_ball_1 to satisfy constraint 8.

26. gotoroom room_3 room_4 purple_door_2 (now I'm in room_4)
27. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_2

Now, I've satisfied constraint 8 (grey_door_1 is unlocked and I'm holding blue_ball_1).

I need to satisfy constraint 10 by locking purple_door_2 at some point. But before that, I need to get grey_ball_2 to room_1 to satisfy constraint 11.

28. gotoroom room_4 room_2 grey_door_1 (now I'm in room_2)
29. gotoempty
30. drop blue_ball_1 room_2 (now I'm not holding any object)
31. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_2
32. pick grey_ball_1 room_2 (now I'm holding grey_ball_1)
33. gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1 (now I'm in room_1)
34. gotoempty
35. drop grey_ball_1 room_1 (now I'm not holding any object)
36. gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1 (now I'm in room_2)
37. gotoroom room_2 room_4 grey_door_1 (now I'm in room_4)
38. gotoobject grey_ball_2 room_4
39. pick grey_ball_2 room_4 (now I'm holding grey_ball_2)
40. gotoroom room_4 room_2 grey_door_1 (now I'm in room_2)
41. gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1 (now I'm in room_1)
42. gotoempty
43. drop grey_ball_2 room_1 (now grey_ball_2 is in room_1)

Now, I've deposited grey_ball_2 in room_1, which means I can lock purple_door_2 to satisfy constraint 10 and constraint 11.

44. gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_1 (now I'm in room_3)
45. gotodoor purple_door_2 room_3 room_4
46. toggle purple_door_2 (now purple_door_2 is locked)

I've now satisfied constraint 10 (purple_door_2 is locked) and, since grey_ball_2 is in room_1, I've also satisfied constraint 11.

My goal was to find a blue door that's unlocked and be in front of it. blue_door_1 is unlocked, so I need to go in front of it.

47. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_1

Now, I'm in front of blue_door_1, which is blue and unlocked, satisfying the goal.

Wait, let me check if I've satisfied all the constraints:

1. Constraint 1: I must be in room_4 at some point. I satisfied this; I was in room_4 initially.
2. Constraint 2: After being in room_4, I must be in room_1. I satisfied this; I went to room_1 after being in room_4.
3. Constraint 3: purple_door_2 must be unlocked at some point. I satisfied this; I unlocked purple_door_2.
4. Constraint 4: Before purple_door_2 is unlocked, I must be in room_3 holding purple_ball_1. I satisfied this; I was in room_3 holding purple_ball_1 before unlocking purple_door_2.
5. Constraint 5: At some point, grey_door_1 must be unlocked and I must be holding purple_ball_1. I believe I satisfied this after step 17; I was holding purple_ball_1 and grey_door_1 was unlocked.
6. Constraint 6: I must be in room_3 at some point. I satisfied this; I went to room_3.
7. Constraint 7: Before being in room_3, I must either be holding grey_box_1 or grey_ball_2 must be in room_1. I satisfied this; I was holding grey_box_1 before going to room_3.
8. Constraint 8: At some point, grey_door_1 must be unlocked and I must be holding blue_ball_1. I satisfied this after step 27; I was holding blue_ball_1 and grey_door_1 was unlocked.
9. Constraint 9: I must be in room_1 at some point. I satisfied this; I went to room_1.
10. Constraint 10: purple_door_2 must be locked at some point. I satisfied this; I locked purple_door_2.
11. Constraint 11: After purple_door_2 is locked, grey_ball_2 must be in room_1. I satisfied this; grey_ball_2 was in room_1 when I locked purple_door_2.

I've satisfied all the constraints, and I've achieved the goal of being in front of a blue door (blue_door_1) that's unlocked.

However, I don't think my plan is correct, because I assumed I could move grey_ball_1 from room_2 to room_1. But the problem statement does say grey_ball_1 is in room_2, not room_1. So, let me revise steps 31-35 to simply be about getting grey_ball_2 to room_1.

Actually, looking at my plan, I don't have steps 31-35 dealing with grey_ball_1. Instead, I handle grey_ball_2 in steps 38-43, which seems correct. But let's double-check.

Ah, I've had one inconsistency. After step 27, I stated I was in front of grey_door_1 in room_4 while holding blue_ball_1. But my previous step (26) had me going from room_3 to room_4, and I would need an additional step to go to the door. Let me fix this:

26. gotoroom room_3 room_4 purple_door_2 (now I'm in room_4)
27. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_2

Now, I'm in front of grey_door_1 while holding blue_ball_1, satisfying constraint 8.

Also, in step 31, I referred to grey_ball_1 which was incorrect, I was trying to pick up grey_ball_2. But steps 38-43 handle grey_ball_2 correctly, so I can remove steps 31-35.

So, the corrected plan is:

1. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_2
2. toggle grey_door_1 (now grey_door_1 is unlocked)
3. gotoroom room_4 room_2 grey_door_1 (now I'm in room_2)
4. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_2
5. pick grey_box_1 room_2 (now I'm holding grey_box_1)
6. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1
7. toggle purple_door_1 (now purple_door_1 is unlocked)
8. gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1 (now I'm in room_1)
9. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_3

39. gotodoor purple_door_2 room_3 room_4
40. toggle purple_door_2 (now purple_door_2 is locked)
41. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_1

This should satisfy all the constraints and achieve the goal of being in front of blue_door_1, which is blue and unlocked. Actually, could we optimize this a bit more?

Let me think about that step by step.

I've read over the plan, and there are some unnecessary steps:

1. I picked up grey_box_1 in steps 4-5 for constraint 7 (before going to room_3, I must have held grey_box_1 or grey_ball_2 must be in room_1). I then dropped it in room_1 (steps 11-12), but this doesn't help with moving grey_ball_2 to room_1. It'd be more efficient if I didn't handle grey_box_1 at all, and instead moved grey_ball_2 to room_1 first.

2. In the later part of the plan, after satisfying constraint 8 (being in front of grey_door_1 holding blue_ball_1), I moved blue_ball_1 to room_2 (steps 28-30) and then went back to room_4 to get grey_ball_2. Instead, I could have dropped blue_ball_1 in room_4.

Let me rewrite the plan:

1. gotoobject grey_ball_2 room_4 (to pick up grey_ball_2 and move it to room_1, satisfying constraint 7)
2. pick grey_ball_2 room_4 (now I'm holding grey_ball_2)
3. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_2
4. toggle grey_door_1 (now grey_door_1 is unlocked)
5. gotoroom room_4 room_2 grey_door_1 (now I'm in room_2)
6. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1
7. toggle purple_door_1 (now purple_door_1 is unlocked)
8. gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1 (now I'm in room_1)
9. gotoempty
10. drop grey_ball_2 room_1 (now grey_ball_2 is in room_1, satisfying constraint 7)
11. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_3
12. toggle blue_door_1 (now blue_door_1 is unlocked)
13. gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_1 (now I'm in room_3, satisfying constraint 6)
14. gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_1 (now I'm in room_1)
15. gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1 (now I'm in room_2)
16. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_2
17. pick purple_ball_1 room_2 (now I'm holding purple_ball_1)
18. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_4 (I'm in room_2 in front of grey_door_1 holding purple_ball_1, satisfying constraint 5)
19. gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1 (now I'm in room_1)
20. gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_1 (now I'm in room_3)
21. gotodoor purple_door_2 room_3 room_4
22. toggle purple_door_2 (now purple_door_2 is unlocked, satisfying constraint 3 and constraint 4)
23. gotoempty
24. drop purple_ball_1 room_3 (now I'm not holding any object)
25. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_3
26. pick blue_ball_1 room_3 (now I'm holding blue_ball_1)
27. gotoroom room_3 room_4 purple_door_2 (now I'm in room_4, satisfying constraint 1)
28. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_2 (I'm in room_4 in front of grey_door_1 holding blue_ball_1, satisfying constraint 8)
29. gotoroom room_4 room_3 purple_door_2 (now I'm in room_3)
30. gotodoor purple_door_2 room_3 room_4
31. toggle purple_door_2 (now purple_door_2 is locked, satisfying constraint 10 and constraint 11)
32. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_1

Now I'm in front of blue_door_1, which is unlocked, satisfying the goal.

Let's see if there are any further optimizations I can make:

In steps 13-15, I go from room_1 to room_3, then back to room_1, and then to room_2. This can be shortened by just going from room_1 to room_2 directly, excluding room_3. But this would violate constraint 6 (I must be in room_3 at some point). I could instead move the visit to room_3 to after I pick up purple_ball_1 (which makes more sense for constraint 4). But then I'd need to come back to room_2 to pick up purple_ball_1.

Actually, this plan already has a problem. To satisfy constraint 4, I need to be in room_3 holding purple_ball_1 before I unlock purple_door_2. But to get purple_ball_1 (which is in room_2) to room_3, I need to go through room_1 or room_4. This means purple_door_2 should be locked during this transit. So, I need to ensure that I don't unlock purple_door_2 before I get to room_3 with purple_ball_1.

Let's revise:

1. gotoobject grey_ball_2 room_4 (to pick up grey_ball_2 and move it to room_1, satisfying constraint 7)
2. pick grey_ball_2 room_4 (now I'm holding grey_ball_2)
3. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_2
4. toggle grey_door_1 (now grey_door_1 is unlocked)
5. gotoroom room_4 room_2 grey_door_1 (now I'm in room_2)
6. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1
7. toggle purple_door_1 (now purple_door_1 is unlocked)
8. gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1 (now I'm in room_1)
9. gotoempty
10. drop grey_ball_2 room_1 (now grey_ball_2 is in room_1, satisfying constraint 7)
11. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_3
12. toggle blue_door_1 (now blue_door_1 is unlocked)
13. gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1 (now I'm in room_2)
14. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_2
15. pick purple_ball_1 room_2 (now I'm holding purple_ball_1)
16. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_4 (I'm in room_2 in front of grey_door_1 holding purple_ball_1, satisfying constraint 5)
17. gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1 (now I'm in room_1)
18. gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_1 (now I'm in room_3 holding purple_ball_1, satisfying constraint 4)
19. gotodoor purple_door_2 room_3 room_4
20. toggle purple_door_2 (now purple_door_2 is unlocked, satisfying constraint 3)
21. gotoempty
22. drop purple_ball_1 room_3 (now I'm not holding any object)
23. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_3
24. pick blue_ball_1 room_3 (now I'm holding blue_ball_1)
25. gotoroom room_3 room_4 purple_door_2 (now I'm in room_4)
26. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_2 (I'm in room_4 in front of grey_door_1 holding blue_ball_1, satisfying constraint 8)
27. gotoroom room_4 room_3 purple_door_2 (now I'm in room_3)
28. gotodoor purple_door_2 room_3 room_4
29. toggle purple_door_2 (now purple_door_2 is locked, satisfying constraint 10 and constraint 11)
30. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_1

Now I'm in front of blue_door_1, which is unlocked, satisfying the goal.

I realized step 26 is supposed to be "goto door" not "go to room", which means I wasn't in room_2 in front of grey_door_1. Let me fix that. Actually, wait, I think that step is correct. Steps 26 and 27 are:

26. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_2 (I'm in room_4 in front of grey_door_1 holding blue_ball_1, satisfying constraint 8)
27. gotoroom room_4 room_3 purple_door_2 (now I'm in room_3)

Which means I was in room_4 in front of grey_door_1, which is correct.

Ah wait, let me double-check another step. Steps 18 and 19 are:

18. gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_1 (now I'm in room_3 holding purple_ball_1, satisfying constraint 4)
19. gotodoor purple_door_2 room_3 room_4

Why am I immediately going to purple_door_2 after being in room_3 with purple_ball_1? I need to satisfy constraint 6 (being in room_3), and I need to go to room_3 with purple_ball_1 before unlocking purple_door_2 (constraint 4), so I need to make sure I don't unlock purple_door_2 before I fulfill these. That makes sense. Just making sure. So yes, my plan is valid.

OK, let's review the plan one more time:

1. gotoobject grey_ball_2 room_4 (to pick up grey_ball_2 and move it to room_1, satisfying constraint 7)
2. pick grey_ball_2 room_4 (now I'm holding grey_ball_2)
3. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_2
4. toggle grey_door_1 (now grey_door_1 is unlocked)
5. gotoroom room_4 room_2 grey_door_1 (now I'm in room_2)
6. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1
7. toggle purple_door_1 (now purple_door_1 is unlocked)
8. gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1 (now I'm in room_1)
9. gotoempty
10. drop grey_ball_2 room_1 (now grey_ball_2 is in room_1, satisfying constraint 7)
11. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_3
12. toggle blue_door_1 (now blue_door_1 is unlocked)
13. gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1 (now I'm in room_2)
14. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_2
15. pick purple_ball_1 room_2 (now I'm holding purple_ball_1)
16. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_4 (I'm in room_2 in front of grey_door_1 holding purple_ball_1, satisfying constraint 5)
17. gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1 (now I'm in room_1)
18. gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_1 (now I'm in room_3 holding purple_ball_1, satisfying constraint 4)
19. gotodoor purple_door_2 room_3 room_4
20. toggle purple_door_2 (now purple_door_2 is unlocked, satisfying constraint 3)
21. gotoempty
22. drop purple_ball_1 room_3 (now I'm not holding any object)
23. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_3
24. pick blue_ball_1 room_3 (now I'm holding blue_ball_1)
25. gotoroom room_3 room_4 purple_door_2 (now I'm in room_4)
26. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_2 (I'm in room_4 in front of grey_door_1 holding blue_ball_1, satisfying constraint 8)
27. gotoroom room_4 room_3 purple_door_2 (now I'm in room_3)
28. gotodoor purple_door_2 room_3 room_4
29. toggle purple_door_2 (now purple_door_2 is locked, satisfying constraint 10 and constraint 11)
30. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_1

I notice that I go to room_3 in steps 18 and 27, and I miss the opportunity to go through step 13 (which is the first time gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_1 could be an option), which would satisfy constraint 6 (I must be in room_3 at some point). I instead decide to go from room_1 to room_2. My reasoning is that I need to pick up purple_ball_1, which is in room_2, to fulfill constraint 4. But to get from room_1 to room_2, I don't need to go through room_3. So, the shorter path is to go directly from room_1 to room_2.

It seems like there are multiple ways to organize the plan, and this one is a valid approach. I've rechecked the constraints, and I believe this plan meets all of them:

Constraint 1: I must be in room_4 at some point. I'm in room_4 at the start and again at step 25.
Constraint 2: After being in room_4, I must be in room_1 at some point. I go to room_1 in step 8, after initially being in room_4.
Constraint 3: purple_door_2 must be unlocked at some point. I unlock it in step 20.
Constraint 4: Before purple_door_2 is unlocked, I must be in room_3 holding purple_ball_1. I am in room_3 holding purple_ball_1 in step 18, before I unlock purple_door_2 in step 20.
Constraint 5: At some point, grey_door_1 must be unlocked and I must be holding purple_ball_1. I satisfied this in step 16; I'm in front of grey_door_1 (which is unlocked) holding purple_ball_1.
Constraint 6: I must be in room_3 at some point. I go to room_3 in step 18.
Constraint 7: Before being in room_3, I must either be holding grey_box_1 or grey_ball_2 must be in room_1. I have grey_ball_2 in room_1 from step 10, before I go to room_3 in step 18.
Constraint 8: At some point, grey_door_1 must be unlocked and I must be holding blue_ball_1. I satisfied this in step 26; I'm in front of grey_door_1 (which is unlocked) holding blue_ball_1.
Constraint 9: I must be in room_1 at some point. I go to room_1 in step 8.
Constraint 10: purple_door_2 must be locked at some point. I lock it in step 29.
Constraint 11: After purple_door_2 is locked, grey_ball_2 must be in room_1. At step 29, grey_ball_2 is in room_1 (put there in step 10).

All constraints are satisfied and the goal (being in front of blue_door_1, which is blue and unlocked) is achieved in step 30. So this plan is valid and optimal.
