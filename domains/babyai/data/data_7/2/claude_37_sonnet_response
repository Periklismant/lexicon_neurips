Let me think about this planning problem step by step.

First, I'll analyze the initial state and the goal:

Initial state:
- You are in room_2
- grey_ball_1 is in room_1
- red_ball_1 is in room_1
- blue_box_1 is in room_2
- red_box_1 is in room_3
- green_box_1 is in room_3
- grey_ball_2 is in room_3
- purple_ball_1 is in room_3
- grey_ball_3 is in room_4
- All doors are locked
- You are not holding any object
- You have visited room_2

Goal:
- There is a ball v such that: v is grey, v is in room_4, you are in room_4, you are in front of v

There are three grey balls: grey_ball_1, grey_ball_2, and grey_ball_3. grey_ball_3 is already in room_4, so I can use that to satisfy the goal. I need to get to room_4 and be in front of grey_ball_3.

Constraints:
1. You must be in front of blue_box_1 in room_1 at some point.
2. purple_door_1 must be unlocked at some point.
3. Before unlocking purple_door_1, you must either be holding or in front of red_ball_1.
4. You must be in room_4 at some point.
5. Before entering room_4, you must be holding blue_box_1 and green_door_1 must be unlocked.
6. grey_door_1 must be unlocked at some point.
7. You must be in room_3 at some point.
8. You must be holding some object at some point.
9. You must be in front of grey_ball_3 at some point.
10. Before being in front of grey_ball_3, you must be in front of an empty position.

Let me plan a sequence of actions that satisfies the goal and all constraints:

1. First, I need to pick up blue_box_1 from room_2, which I'm already in.
2. To satisfy constraint 1, I need to go to room_1 with blue_box_1 and be in front of it there.
3. To go to room_1, I need to unlock red_door_1.
4. Before unlocking purple_door_1 (constraint 2 and 3), I need to be holding or in front of red_ball_1, which is in room_1. 
5. To satisfy constraint 5, before going to room_4, I need to be holding blue_box_1 and green_door_1 must be unlocked.
6. I also need to unlock grey_door_1 at some point (constraint 6).
7. I need to visit room_3 at some point (constraint 7).
8. Before being in front of grey_ball_3 (which is in room_4), I need to be in front of an empty position.

Let me sketch a plan:

1. First in room_2:
   - Go to blue_box_1
   - Pick up blue_box_1 (satisfies constraint 8 - holding some object)

2. Go to and unlock red_door_1:
   - Go to red_door_1 (connecting room_2 and room_1)
   - Toggle red_door_1 (unlock it)

3. Go to room_1:
   - Go to room_1 via red_door_1
   - Drop blue_box_1 (to satisfy constraint 1)
   - Go in front of blue_box_1 (satisfies constraint 1)
   - Pick up blue_box_1 again 

4. Interact with red_ball_1:
   - Go to red_ball_1
   - Drop blue_box_1 (to free hands)
   - Pick up red_ball_1 (satisfies constraint 3)

5. Go back to room_2:
   - Go to red_door_1
   - Go to room_2 via red_door_1

6. Unlock purple_door_1:
   - Go to purple_door_1 (connecting room_2 and room_4)
   - Toggle purple_door_1 (unlock it, satisfies constraint 2)

7. Go back to room_1 to get blue_box_1:
   - Go to red_door_1
   - Go to room_1 via red_door_1
   - Drop red_ball_1
   - Pick up blue_box_1

8. Unlock green_door_1:
   - Go to green_door_1 (connecting room_1 and room_3)
   - Toggle green_door_1 (unlock it)

9. Go to room_3:
   - Go to room_3 via green_door_1 (satisfies constraint 7)

10. Unlock grey_door_1:
    - Go to grey_door_1 (connecting room_3 and room_4)
    - Toggle grey_door_1 (unlock it, satisfies constraint 6)

11. Go to room_4:
    - Go to room_4 via grey_door_1 (holding blue_box_1 and with green_door_1 unlocked, satisfies constraint 5)
    - Go to empty position (satisfies constraint 10)
    - Drop blue_box_1
    - Go to grey_ball_3 (satisfies constraint 9 and goal)

Let me check if this plan satisfies all constraints:
1. ✓ You must be in front of blue_box_1 in room_1 at some point.
2. ✓ purple_door_1 must be unlocked at some point.
3. ✓ Before unlocking purple_door_1, you must either be holding or in front of red_ball_1.
4. ✓ You must be in room_4 at some point.
5. ✓ Before entering room_4, you must be holding blue_box_1 and green_door_1 must be unlocked.
6. ✓ grey_door_1 must be unlocked at some point.
7. ✓ You must be in room_3 at some point.
8. ✓ You must be holding some object at some point.
9. ✓ You must be in front of grey_ball_3 at some point.
10. ✓ Before being in front of grey_ball_3, you must be in front of an empty position.

Let me now convert this sketch into a detailed plan with the specific action format.

Actually, let me refine this plan. I notice I'm being inefficient in some parts. Let me optimize:

1. First in room_2:
   - gotoobject blue_box_1 room_2
   - pick blue_box_1 room_2

2. Go to and unlock red_door_1:
   - gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_1
   - toggle red_door_1

3. Go to room_1:
   - gotoroom room_2 room_1 red_door_1
   - gotoempty
   - drop blue_box_1 room_1
   - gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1 (satisfies constraint 1)
   - pick blue_box_1 room_1
   - gotoobject red_ball_1 room_1
   - gotoempty
   - drop blue_box_1 room_1
   - gotoobject red_ball_1 room_1 (satisfies constraint 3)
   - pick red_ball_1 room_1

4. Go back to room_2:
   - gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_2
   - gotoroom room_1 room_2 red_door_1

5. Unlock purple_door_1:
   - gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_4
   - toggle purple_door_1 (satisfies constraint 2)

6. Go back to room_1:
   - gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_1
   - gotoroom room_2 room_1 red_door_1

7. Drop red_ball_1 and pick up blue_box_1:
   - gotoempty
   - drop red_ball_1 room_1
   - gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1
   - pick blue_box_1 room_1

8. Unlock green_door_1:
   - gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3
   - toggle green_door_1

9. Go to room_3:
   - gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1 (satisfies constraint 7)

10. Unlock grey_door_1:
    - gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4
    - toggle grey_door_1 (satisfies constraint 6)

11. Go to room_4:
    - gotoroom room_3 room_4 grey_door_1 (satisfies constraint 4 and 5)
    - gotoempty (satisfies constraint 10)
    - drop blue_box_1 room_4
    - gotoobject grey_ball_3 room_4 (satisfies constraint 9 and goal)

Let me double-check this plan:

1. ✓ In step 3, we are in front of blue_box_1 in room_1.
2. ✓ In step 5, we unlock purple_door_1.
3. ✓ In step 4, before unlocking purple_door_1, we are holding red_ball_1.
4. ✓ In step 11, we are in room_4.
5. ✓ In step 11, before entering room_4, we are holding blue_box_1 and green_door_1 is unlocked.
6. ✓ In step 10, we unlock grey_door_1.
7. ✓ In step 9, we are in room_3.
8. ✓ In multiple steps, we are holding objects (blue_box_1, red_ball_1).
9. ✓ In step 11, we are in front of grey_ball_3.
10. ✓ In step 11, before being in front of grey_ball_3, we are in front of an empty position.

All constraints are satisfied!

One moment, I need to check if this can be optimized further.

Actually, there is a simpler way to satisfy constraint 3. We don't need to pick up red_ball_1, we just need to be in front of it before unlocking purple_door_1. Let me adjust the plan:

1. First in room_2:
   - gotoobject blue_box_1 room_2
   - pick blue_box_1 room_2

2. Go to and unlock red_door_1:
   - gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_1
   - toggle red_door_1

3. Go to room_1:
   - gotoroom room_2 room_1 red_door_1
   - gotoempty
   - drop blue_box_1 room_1
   - gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1 (satisfies constraint 1)
   - gotoobject red_ball_1 room_1 (satisfies constraint 3)
   - pick blue_box_1 room_1

4. Go back to room_2:
   - gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_2
   - gotoroom room_1 room_2 red_door_1

5. Unlock purple_door_1:
   - gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_4
   - toggle purple_door_1 (satisfies constraint 2)

6. Go to and unlock green_door_1:
   - gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_1
   - gotoroom room_2 room_1 red_door_1
   - gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3
   - toggle green_door_1

7. Go to room_3:
   - gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1 (satisfies constraint 7)

8. Unlock grey_door_1:
   - gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4
   - toggle grey_door_1 (satisfies constraint 6)

9. Go to room_4:
   - gotoroom room_3 room_4 grey_door_1 (satisfies constraint 4 and 5)
   - gotoempty (satisfies constraint 10)
   - drop blue_box_1 room_4
   - gotoobject grey_ball_3 room_4 (satisfies constraint 9 and goal)

Wait, I need to think more about step 3, as I'm dropping blue_box_1 and then trying to gotoobject blue_box_1. This doesn't seem right. Let me correct:

1. First in room_2:
   - gotoobject blue_box_1 room_2
   - pick blue_box_1 room_2

2. Go to and unlock red_door_1:
   - gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_1
   - toggle red_door_1

3. Go to room_1:
   - gotoroom room_2 room_1 red_door_1
   - gotoempty
   - drop blue_box_1 room_1
   - gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1 (satisfies constraint 1)
   - pick blue_box_1 room_1
   - gotoobject red_ball_1 room_1 (satisfies constraint 3)

4. Go back to room_2:
   - gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_2
   - gotoroom room_1 room_2 red_door_1

5. Unlock purple_door_1:
   - gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_4
   - toggle purple_door_1 (satisfies constraint 2)

6. Go to and unlock green_door_1:
   - gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_1
   - gotoroom room_2 room_1 red_door_1
   - gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3
   - toggle green_door_1

7. Go to room_3:
   - gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1 (satisfies constraint 7)

8. Unlock grey_door_1:
   - gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4
   - toggle grey_door_1 (satisfies constraint 6)

9. Go to room_4:
   - gotoroom room_3 room_4 grey_door_1 (satisfies constraint 4 and 5)
   - gotoempty (satisfies constraint 10)
   - drop blue_box_1 room_4
   - gotoobject grey_ball_3 room_4 (satisfies constraint 9 and goal)

That looks better. However, in Step 3, I'm trying to gotoobject red_ball_1 while holding blue_box_1. Let me re-examine the action definitions to confirm if this is allowed.

Upon review of the action definitions, I don't see any precondition that prevents going to an object while holding another object. The precondition for "gotoobject" is only that you're in the same room as the object.

So the plan is correct. Let me double-check if I'm satisfying all constraints with this plan:

1. ✓ In step 3, we are in front of blue_box_1 in room_1.
2. ✓ In step 5, we unlock purple_door_1.
3. ✓ In step 3, before unlocking purple_door_1, we are in front of red_ball_1.
4. ✓ In step 9, we are in room_4.
5. ✓ In step 9, before entering room_4, we are holding blue_box_1 and green_door_1 is unlocked.
6. ✓ In step 8, we unlock grey_door_1.
7. ✓ In step 7, we are in room_3.
8. ✓ In multiple steps, we are holding blue_box_1.
9. ✓ In step 9, we are in front of grey_ball_3.
10. ✓ In step 9, before being in front of grey_ball_3, we are in front of an empty position.

All constraints are satisfied.

I'm going to review the exact sequence of actions once more to ensure correctness and optimal planning:

1. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_2
2. pick blue_box_1 room_2
3. gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_1
4. toggle red_door_1
5. gotoroom room_2 room_1 red_door_1
6. gotoempty
7. drop blue_box_1 room_1
8. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1
9. pick blue_box_1 room_1
10. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_1
11. gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_2
12. gotoroom room_1 room_2 red_door_1
13. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_4
14. toggle purple_door_1
15. gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_1
16. gotoroom room_2 room_1 red_door_1
17. gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3
18. toggle green_door_1
19. gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1
20. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4
21. toggle grey_door_1
22. gotoroom room_3 room_4 grey_door_1
23. gotoempty
24. drop blue_box_1 room_4
25. gotoobject grey_ball_3 room_4

On further reflection, I'm not sure if we need to pick up blue_box_1 immediately after going to room_1 (step 9) if we're going to immediately go to red_ball_1 anyway. However, the constraint requires us to be holding blue_box_1 before entering room_4, so we do need to pick it up at some point.

Actually, I think there's an optimization I can make. Since we're already in room_1 with blue_box_1 and need to go to red_ball_1, we can:
1. goto red_ball_1
2. goto blue_box_1 
3. pick blue_box_1

Instead of:
1. goto blue_box_1
2. pick blue_box_1
3. goto red_ball_1

Let's adjust the plan:

1. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_2
2. pick blue_box_1 room_2
3. gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_1
4. toggle red_door_1
5. gotoroom room_2 room_1 red_door_1
6. gotoempty
7. drop blue_box_1 room_1
8. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_1
9. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1
10. pick blue_box_1 room_1
11. gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_2
12. gotoroom room_1 room_2 red_door_1
13. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_4
14. toggle purple_door_1
15. gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_1
16. gotoroom room_2 room_1 red_door_1
17. gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3
18. toggle green_door_1
19. gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1
20. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4
21. toggle grey_door_1
22. gotoroom room_3 room_4 grey_door_1
23. gotoempty
24. drop blue_box_1 room_4
25. gotoobject grey_ball_3 room_4

Wait, this doesn't seem optimal. Let me try again:

1. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_2
2. pick blue_box_1 room_2
3. gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_1
4. toggle red_door_1
5. gotoroom room_2 room_1 red_door_1
6. gotoempty
7. drop blue_box_1 room_1
8. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1 (satisfies constraint 1)
9. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_1 (satisfies constraint 3)
10. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1
11. pick blue_box_1 room_1
12. gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_2
13. gotoroom room_1 room_2 red_door_1
14. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_4
15. toggle purple_door_1 (satisfies constraint 2)
16. gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_1
17. gotoroom room_2 room_1 red_door_1
18. gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3
19. toggle green_door_1
20. gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1 (satisfies constraint 7)
21. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4
22. toggle grey_door_1 (satisfies constraint 6)
23. gotoroom room_3 room_4 grey_door_1 (satisfies constraint 4 and 5)
24. gotoempty (satisfies constraint 10)
25. drop blue_box_1 room_4
26. gotoobject grey_ball_3 room_4 (satisfies constraint 9 and goal)

This looks good. Let me check if the sequence satisfies all constraints:

1. ✓ In step 8, we are in front of blue_box_1, and we are in room_1.
2. ✓ In step 15, we unlock purple_door_1.
3. ✓ In step 9, before unlocking purple_door_1, we are in front of red_ball_1.
4. ✓ In step 23, we are in room_4.
5. ✓ In step 23, before entering room_4, we are holding blue_box_1 and green_door_1 is unlocked.
6. ✓ In step 22, we unlock grey_door_1.
7. ✓ In step 20, we are in room_3.
8. ✓ In multiple steps, we are holding blue_box_1.
9. ✓ In step 26, we are in front of grey_ball_3.
10. ✓ In step 24, before being in front of grey_ball_3, we are in front of an empty position.

All constraints are satisfied.

Let me see if there's any way to optimize the plan further by removing unnecessary steps.

I think we can simplify steps 8-10. After dropping blue_box_1, we can:
1. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_1 (satisfies constraint 3)
2. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1 (satisfies constraint 1)
3. pick blue_box_1 room_1

This way, we eliminate one unnecessary step while still satisfying all constraints. Let me update the plan:

1. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_2
2. pick blue_box_1 room_2
3. gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_1
4. toggle red_door_1
5. gotoroom room_2 room_1 red_door_1
6. gotoempty
7. drop blue_box_1 room_1
8. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_1 (satisfies constraint 3)
9. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1 (satisfies constraint 1)
10. pick blue_box_1 room_1
11. gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_2
12. gotoroom room_1 room_2 red_door_1
13. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_4
14. toggle purple_door_1 (satisfies constraint 2)
15. gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_1
16. gotoroom room_2 room_1 red_door_1
17. gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3
18. toggle green_door_1
19. gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1 (satisfies constraint 7)
20. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4
21. toggle grey_door_1 (satisfies constraint 6)
22. gotoroom room_3 room_4 grey_door_1 (satisfies constraint 4 and 5)
23. gotoempty (satisfies constraint 10)
24. drop blue_box_1 room_4
25. gotoobject grey_ball_3 room_4 (satisfies constraint 9 and goal)

Hmm, I think I misunderstood constraint 1 initially. Let me read it again:

"The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'The following conditions are all true: "you are in front of blue_box_1", "you are in room_1"'."

I was interpreting this as saying that blue_box_1 needs to be in room_1, but actually, it's just saying that I need to be in room_1 and in front of blue_box_1. So if blue_box_1 is initially in room_2, I need to move it to room_1 first. Let me review the initial state and confirm that blue_box_1 is indeed in room_2.

Yes, the initial state says "blue_box_1 is in room_2".

So the constraint doesn't require that blue_box_1 is initially in room_1, just that at some point, I'm in room_1 and in front of blue_box_1. To satisfy this, I'm moving blue_box_1 to room_1, then going in front of it.

Let me check steps 5-9 again.
5. gotoroom room_2 room_1 red_door_1 -- I'm now in room_1
6. gotoempty -- I'm in front of an empty position
7. drop blue_box_1 room_1 -- I drop blue_box_1 in room_1
8. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_1 -- I go to red_ball_1 in room_1 (for constraint 3)
9. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1 -- I go to blue_box_1 in room_1 (satisfies constraint 1)

Yes, this satisfies constraint 1 because at step 9, I'm in room_1 and in front of blue_box_1.

I think the plan is optimal and correct. Let me do one final review:

1. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_2
2. pick blue_box_1 room_2
3. gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_1
4. toggle red_door_1
5. gotoroom room_2 room_1 red_door_1
6. gotoempty
7. drop blue_box_1 room_1
8. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_1 (satisfies constraint 3)
9. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1 (satisfies constraint 1)
10. pick blue_box_1 room_1
11. gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_2
12. gotoroom room_1 room_2 red_door_1
13. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_4
14. toggle purple_door_1 (satisfies constraint 2)
15. gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_1
16. gotoroom room_2 room_1 red_door_1
17. gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3
18. toggle green_door_1
19. gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1 (satisfies constraint 7)
20. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4
21. toggle grey_door_1 (satisfies constraint 6)
22. gotoroom room_3 room_4 grey_door_1 (satisfies constraint 4 and 5)
23. gotoempty (satisfies constraint 10)
24. drop blue_box_1 room_4
25. gotoobject grey_ball_3 room_4 (satisfies constraint 9 and goal)

This plan satisfies the goal and all constraints in an optimal way. The goal is to have a grey ball in room_4, be in room_4, and be in front of the grey ball. grey_ball_3 is already in room_4, so we just need to get to room_4 and be in front of grey_ball_3.

So my final solution is:

```
gotoobject blue_box_1 room_2
pick blue_box_1 room_2
gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_1
toggle red_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_1 red_door_1
gotoempty
drop blue_box_1 room_1
gotoobject red_ball_1 room_1
gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1
pick blue_box_1 room_1
gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_2
gotoroom room_1 room_2 red_door_1
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_4
toggle purple_door_1
gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_1
gotoroom room_2 room_1 red_door_1
gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3
toggle green_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4
toggle grey_door_1
gotoroom room_3 room_4 grey_door_1
gotoempty
drop blue_box_1 room_4
gotoobject grey_ball_3 room_4
```
