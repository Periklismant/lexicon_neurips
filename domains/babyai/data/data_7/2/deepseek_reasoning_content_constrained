Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. Hmm, the goal is to have a grey ball in room_4, be in room_4, and be in front of that ball. The constraints are a bit tricky, so I need to make sure all of them are satisfied in the plan. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the initial state: I'm in room_2, and all doors are locked. The objects are spread across different rooms. The constraints include needing to be in front of blue_box_1 in room_1 at some point, unlocking purple_door_1 (but only after being in front of or holding red_ball_1), getting to room_4 which requires having held blue_box_1 and green_door_1 being unlocked, unlocking grey_door_1, visiting room_3, holding some object, and being in front of grey_ball_3 only after being in front of empty.

Starting from room_2. The blue_box_1 is here. Maybe I can pick it up. But to do that, I need to go to it first. So actions: gotoobject blue_box_1 room_2, then pick it. But wait, all doors are locked. To get to other rooms, I need to unlock doors. But how? Because I can't leave room_2 unless a door is unlocked. Let's see the doors connected to room_2: red_door_1 connects to room_1, and purple_door_1 connects to room_4. Both are locked. So first, maybe I need to unlock a door. But to toggle a door, I need to be in front of it. So in room_2, the doors are red_door_1 (to room_1) and purple_door_1 (to room_4). So maybe I can go to red_door_1 first. But wait, the preconditions for gotodoor: need to be in a room connected by the door, and no object blocking the position in front of the door. Are there any objects blocking doors? The initial state doesn't mention any objects blocking doors. So assuming they are not blocked. So I can go to red_door_1 in room_2. Then toggle it to unlock. But red_door_1 is red. Wait, the toggle action just changes the state from locked to unlocked. So maybe unlock red_door_1 first. But wait, the constraints require that at some point purple_door_1 is unlocked, and that before that, I have to be holding or in front of red_ball_1. Also, to get to room_4, I need to go through purple_door_1 or via other rooms. Let's think about the path.

The goal is to be in room_4 with a grey ball. The grey_ball_3 is already in room_4. So maybe the plan is to go to room_4, pick up the grey_ball_3 and drop it there again? But the goal is to have it in room_4, which it already is. But the goal says "there is a ball v such that v is grey, in room_4, you are in room_4, and in front of v." So maybe just moving to room_4 and then going in front of grey_ball_3. But the initial position of grey_ball_3 is in room_4. So maybe the steps are: get to room_4, gotoobject grey_ball_3 room_4. But how to get there.

But all doors are locked. So need to unlock doors. Let's see: from room_2, the doors are red_door_1 (to room_1) and purple_door_1 (to room_4). So if I can unlock purple_door_1, then I can go from room_2 to room_4. But to toggle purple_door_1, I need to be in front of it. So in room_2, gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_4. Then toggle it. But the constraint is that before unlocking purple_door_1, I must have been holding or in front of red_ball_1. Red_ball_1 is in room_1. So that complicates things. Because to get to room_1, I need to go through red_door_1 from room_2, but red_door_1 is locked. So I need to unlock red_door_1 first. But to unlock red_door_1, I need to be in front of it. So from room_2, gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_1, then toggle it. Then go through to room_1. Then gotoobject red_ball_1 in room_1. Then maybe pick it up. Then go back to room_2, then unlock purple_door_1. But that would satisfy the constraint that before purple_door_1 is unlocked, I were in front of or holding red_ball_1.

But also, the constraint that when you are in room_4, there must have been a previous state where you were holding blue_box_1 and green_door_1 was unlocked. Hmm. So green_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3. To unlock green_door_1, you need to be in front of it. So if I go to room_1, then go to green_door_1 (from room_1), toggle it. Then green_door_1 becomes unlocked. But how does that tie into holding blue_box_1? Blue_box_1 is in room_2. So maybe after unlocking red_door_1, go to room_1, then go back to room_2, pick up blue_box_1, then go to room_1 again, unlock green_door_1, then proceed to room_3 via green_door_1. But how does that fit with getting to room_4?

Alternatively, perhaps the plan requires moving through multiple rooms. Let's outline possible steps:

1. Unlock red_door_1 (from room_2):
   - gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_1
   - toggle red_door_1 (unlock)
   - gotoroom room_2 room_1 red_door_1 (now in room_1)
   Now, in room_1, there's grey_ball_1 and red_ball_1. Need to interact with red_ball_1 for the purple_door_1 constraint.

2. Go to red_ball_1 in room_1:
   - gotoobject red_ball_1 room_1
   - Then, either pick it up or just being in front satisfies the constraint. But the constraint says "at least one of holding or in front of". So maybe just being in front is enough. So after this step, the purple_door_1 can be unlocked later.

But then, we need to unlock purple_door_1. So after dealing with red_ball_1, go back to room_2, then unlock purple_door_1. But how? Let's see.

Wait, after step 1, you are in room_1. To go back to room_2, use red_door_1 again (already unlocked). So:

3. gotoroom room_1 room_2 red_door_1 (back to room_2)
4. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_4
5. toggle purple_door_1 (unlock)
   Now, purple_door_1 is unlocked. This satisfies the constraint that before unlocking it, we were in front of red_ball_1 (step 2).

But then, to get to room_4, use purple_door_1. But wait, the constraint for being in room_4 requires that in an earlier state, you were holding blue_box_1 and green_door_1 was unlocked. So need to handle that.

So before going to room_4, we need to have held blue_box_1 and green_door_1 must be unlocked. Let's see. Blue_box_1 is in room_2. So perhaps:

After step 3 (back in room_2), pick up blue_box_1.

But to pick it up, you need to be in front of it. So:

4. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_2
5. pick blue_box_1 room_2
   Now holding blue_box_1.

But then, green_door_1 must be unlocked. Green_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3. So to unlock it, need to be in front of it. So perhaps:

6. gotoroom room_2 room_1 red_door_1 (back to room_1)
7. gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3
8. toggle green_door_1 (unlock)
   Now green_door_1 is unlocked.

So now, the conditions for entering room_4 (since to get to room_4 from room_2 via purple_door_1, but we need to have in some state: holding blue_box_1 and green_door_1 is unlocked. So step 5 is holding blue_box_1, step 8 makes green_door_1 unlocked. So any state after step 5 and 8 would satisfy that. So when we eventually go to room_4, we must have had these conditions met before.

But then, how do we get to room_4? From room_2, via purple_door_1 (now unlocked). So:

9. gotoroom room_2 room_4 purple_door_1 (now in room_4)
   But the goal is to be in room_4 and in front of a grey ball. The grey_ball_3 is already there. So:

10. gotoobject grey_ball_3 room_4

But there's a constraint that when in front of grey_ball_3, there must have been a prior state where you were in front of empty. So before step 10, we need to have been in front of empty. How to achieve that.

Perhaps after dropping the blue_box_1 somewhere. Wait, but the goal doesn't require dropping it. But maybe after entering room_4, you need to drop the blue_box_1 (if you're holding it) or go to empty first.

Wait, let's see. We're holding blue_box_1 from step 5. So after step 9 (in room_4), we can:

10. gotoempty (to be in front of empty)
11. drop blue_box_1 room_4 (but need to be holding it)
Wait, but step 10: after gotoempty, you are in front of empty. Then you can drop the blue_box_1 here, which would place it in room_4. Then:

11. drop blue_box_1 room_4

Then, gotoobject grey_ball_3 room_4. But step 10 (gotoempty) makes you in front of empty, which satisfies the condition that before being in front of grey_ball_3, you were in front of empty. Then step 12: gotoobject grey_ball_3.

But the goal requires you to be in room_4 and in front of a grey ball. So step 12 would achieve that.

But let's check the constraints:

- Must be in front of blue_box_1 in room_1. When did that happen? Wait, blue_box_1 is in room_2 initially. Unless we move it to room_1. Wait, the initial state has blue_box_1 in room_2. So to be in front of it in room_1, we need to move it there. But in the current plan, we picked blue_box_1 in room_2 (step 5), then carried it to room_4 and dropped it there (step 11). So that doesn't put it in room_1. So the constraint "you are in front of blue_box_1 in room_1" is not satisfied. So that's a problem. So we need to have blue_box_1 in room_1 at some point.

So how to handle that. Maybe after picking up blue_box_1 in room_2, take it to room_1. Let's adjust the plan.

After step 5 (holding blue_box_1 in room_2):

6. gotoroom room_2 room_1 red_door_1 (back to room_1)
7. drop blue_box_1 room_1 (now it's in room_1)
   Now, in room_1, blue_box_1 is present. Then, to be in front of it, do:

8. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1

This satisfies the constraint that "you are in front of blue_box_1 in room_1" in some state. Then, proceed to unlock green_door_1.

9. gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3
10. toggle green_door_1 (unlock)
    Now green_door_1 is unlocked. Then, perhaps go to room_3 via green_door_1, which is required to visit room_3.

11. gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1 (now in room_3)
    This satisfies the "you are in room_3" constraint.

In room_3, there's red_box_1, green_box_1, grey_ball_2, purple_ball_1. Also, grey_door_1 connects room_3 to room_4. Need to unlock grey_door_1 (another constraint). But grey_door_1 is locked initially. So to unlock it, need to be in front of it.

So:

12. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4
13. toggle grey_door_1 (unlock)
    Now grey_door_1 is unlocked. Then, go to room_4 via grey_door_1.

14. gotoroom room_3 room_4 grey_door_1 (now in room_4)
    Now in room_4. But the constraint for entering room_4 requires that in an earlier state, you were holding blue_box_1 and green_door_1 was unlocked. So when we were holding blue_box_1 (steps 5-7) and green_door_1 was unlocked (step 10), that's satisfied. Also, the constraint "you are in room_4" is met here. Then, to satisfy the goal, need to be in front of grey_ball_3 in room_4. But grey_ball_3 is already there. So:

15. gotoobject grey_ball_3 room_4

But the constraint before that is that you were in front of empty. So before step 15, need to have been in front of empty. So perhaps, after entering room_4, first gotoempty:

14.5. gotoempty (in room_4)
Then step 15: gotoobject grey_ball_3.

This way, step 14.5 satisfies the prior state of being in front of empty before being in front of grey_ball_3.

But wait, in this plan, when do we unlock purple_door_1? Because the constraint requires that purple_door_1 is unlocked in some state. In the current steps, purple_door_1 is still locked. So we need to unlock it. But how? Because if we went via grey_door_1, we might not have to use purple_door_1. But the constraint requires that purple_door_1 is unlocked at least once. So we have to include that.

So perhaps we need to unlock both purple_door_1 and grey_door_1. But how?

Alternative path: From room_2, after unlocking red_door_1, go to room_1, then unlock green_door_1, go to room_3, unlock grey_door_1, then go to room_4. But also, need to unlock purple_door_1. But that door is in room_2 leading to room_4. So maybe after step 5 (holding blue_box_1 in room_2), instead of taking it to room_1, perhaps go to purple_door_1 in room_2, unlock it, but before that, satisfy the red_ball_1 condition.

Wait, let's try a different approach.

1. Start in room_2.

2. Unlock red_door_1:
   - gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_1
   - toggle red_door_1 (now unlocked)
   - gotoroom room_2 room_1 red_door_1 (now in room_1)

3. In room_1, go to red_ball_1:
   - gotoobject red_ball_1 room_1
   (This satisfies the condition for purple_door_1 unlock later)

4. Go back to room_2:
   - gotoroom room_1 room_2 red_door_1

5. Now, unlock purple_door_1:
   - gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_4
   - toggle purple_door_1 (unlocked)

6. Now, go to room_4 via purple_door_1:
   - gotoroom room_2 room_4 purple_door_1
   But then, need to satisfy the constraint that when entering room_4, you had earlier held blue_box_1 and green_door_1 was unlocked.

   But in this path, we haven't interacted with blue_box_1 or green_door_1. So that's a problem.

So this approach doesn't satisfy that constraint. Therefore, need to include steps involving blue_box_1 and green_door_1.

Alternative plan:

After step 4 (back in room_2):

5. Pick up blue_box_1:
   - gotoobject blue_box_1 room_2
   - pick blue_box_1 room_2

6. Go to room_1:
   - gotoroom room_2 room_1 red_door_1

7. Drop blue_box_1 in room_1:
   - drop blue_box_1 room_1

8. Now, in front of blue_box_1 in room_1 (after dropping, you're in front of it). So this satisfies the constraint.

9. Unlock green_door_1:
   - gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3
   - toggle green_door_1 (unlock)

10. Go to room_3:
    - gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1

11. Unlock grey_door_1:
    - gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4
    - toggle grey_door_1 (unlock)

12. Go to room_4:
    - gotoroom room_3 room_4 grey_door_1

13. Now in room_4. Need to be in front of grey_ball_3. But first, gotoempty to satisfy the prior condition.

14. gotoempty room_4

15. gotoobject grey_ball_3 room_4

This plan would satisfy:

- Being in front of blue_box_1 in room_1 (step 7 and 8)
- purple_door_1 is unlocked? No, in this plan, we didn't unlock purple_door_1. So that's a problem. The constraint requires that purple_door_1 is unlocked in some state. So this plan is invalid.

So need to include unlocking purple_door_1. How?

Maybe after step 5 (holding blue_box_1 in room_2), before going to room_1, unlock purple_door_1.

Wait:

After step 5 (holding blue_box_1 in room_2):

6. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_4
7. toggle purple_door_1 (unlock)
   Now purple_door_1 is unlocked. But the constraint says before unlocking purple_door_1, must have been in front of or holding red_ball_1. Which was satisfied in step 3 (gotoobject red_ball_1).

Then, proceed to take blue_box_1 to room_1, drop it, unlock green_door_1, etc.

But then, when you go to room_4 via purple_door_1, you can, but the other constraint when entering room_4 requires that in an earlier state, you were holding blue_box_1 (which you were) and green_door_1 was unlocked (which would be after unlocking it). So in this plan:

After step 7 (purple_door_1 unlocked):

8. gotoroom room_2 room_1 red_door_1
9. drop blue_box_1 room_1
10. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1 (satisfies the constraint)
11. gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3
12. toggle green_door_1 (unlock)
13. gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1 (now in room_3)
14. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4
15. toggle grey_door_1 (unlock)
16. gotoroom room_3 room_4 grey_door_1 (now in room_4)
17. gotoempty
18. gotoobject grey_ball_3 room_4

This plan includes unlocking purple_door_1 (step 7), which satisfies that constraint. Also, when entering room_4 (step 16), the earlier state of holding blue_box_1 (steps 5-9) and green_door_1 being unlocked (step 12) is satisfied.

Now, check all constraints:

1. "you are in front of blue_box_1 in room_1" - step 10.

2. "purple_door_1 is not locked" - step 7.

3. Before unlocking purple_door_1 (step7), must have been holding red_ball_1 or in front of it. Step 3 was in front of red_ball_1.

4. "you are in room_4" - step16.

5. Before being in room_4, must have held blue_box_1 (step5-9) and green_door_1 unlocked (step12).

6. "grey_door_1 is not locked" - step15.

7. "you are in room_3" - step13.

8. "you are holding some object" - step5-9 (holding blue_box_1).

9. "you are in front of grey_ball_3" - step18.

10. Before step18, must have been in front of empty (step17).

Additionally, we need to have visited room_3 (step13) and unlocked grey_door_1 (step15).

This seems to satisfy all constraints. Now, let's write the steps in order:

1. gotoobject red_door_1 room_2 (Wait, the gotodoor action is "gotodoor d r1 r2", where r1 is current room. So in room_2, the door is red_door_1 connecting room_2 and room_1. So:

1. gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_1
2. toggle red_door_1
3. gotoroom room_2 room_1 red_door_1
4. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_1
5. gotoroom room_1 room_2 red_door_1
6. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_2
7. pick blue_box_1 room_2
8. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_4
9. toggle purple_door_1
10. gotoroom room_2 room_1 red_door_1
11. drop blue_box_1 room_1
12. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1
13. gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3
14. toggle green_door_1
15. gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1
16. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4
17. toggle grey_door_1
18. gotoroom room_3 room_4 grey_door_1
19. gotoempty
20. gotoobject grey_ball_3 room_4

But wait, step 19 is gotoempty in room_4. Then step 20 is gotoobject. This satisfies the last constraint.

Now, check if all actions are possible.

Check preconditions:

- Step1: gotodoor red_door_1 in room_2. Preconditions: in room connected by door (yes, room_2), no object blocking. Assume no blocking. Valid.

- Step2: toggle red_door_1. Must be in front of it. After step1, you are in front. So valid.

- Step3: gotoroom from room_2 to room_1. Door is unlocked now. Valid.

- Step4: gotoobject red_ball_1 in room_1. You are in room_1. Valid.

- Step5: gotoroom back to room_2 via red_door_1, which is unlocked.

- Step6: gotoobject blue_box_1 in room_2. Valid.

- Step7: pick blue_box_1. Hands are empty. Valid.

- Step8: gotodoor purple_door_1 in room_2. Valid.

- Step9: toggle purple_door_1. In front of it. Valid.

- Step10: gotoroom room_2 to room_1 via red_door_1. Valid.

- Step11: drop blue_box_1. Holding it, and in front of empty? Wait, after step10, you are in room_1, and after gotoroom, you are no longer in front of anything. So to drop, you need to be in front of an empty position. So after arriving in room_1, you are not in front of anything. So before dropping, you need to gotoempty or goto an object.

Wait, after step10: after gotoroom, you are in room_1, not in front of anything. So to drop, you need to be in front of an empty position.

So after step10, you need to perform gotoempty first, then drop.

Wait, this is a mistake in the previous steps. Because when you use gotoroom, the effect is that you are no longer in front of anything. So to drop, you need to be in front of an empty spot. So steps after step10:

10. gotoroom room_2 room_1 red_door_1 (now in room_1, not in front of anything)

11. gotoempty (now in front of empty)

12. drop blue_box_1 room_1

But in the earlier plan, I missed the gotoempty step here. So this is a correction.

So the corrected steps would be:

After step10 (gotoroom room_2 room_1 red_door_1):

11. gotoempty (room_1)

12. drop blue_box_1 room_1

13. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1

14. gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3

15. toggle green_door_1

16. gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1

17. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4

18. toggle grey_door_1

19. gotoroom room_3 room_4 grey_door_1

20. gotoempty

21. gotoobject grey_ball_3 room_4

This adds a step (step11: gotoempty). Also, step12 becomes drop.

This way, after entering room_1, you gotoempty, then drop the box, which places you in front of it. Then gotoobject to be in front of blue_box_1 (step13), which satisfies the constraint.

Now, the steps are:

1. gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_1

2. toggle red_door_1

3. gotoroom room_2 room_1 red_door_1

4. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_1

5. gotoroom room_1 room_2 red_door_1

6. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_2

7. pick blue_box_1 room_2

8. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_4

9. toggle purple_door_1

10. gotoroom room_2 room_1 red_door_1

11. gotoempty

12. drop blue_box_1 room_1

13. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1

14. gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3

15. toggle green_door_1

16. gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1

17. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4

18. toggle grey_door_1

19. gotoroom room_3 room_4 grey_door_1

20. gotoempty

21. gotoobject grey_ball_3 room_4

Now check the constraints again:

- Step13: in front of blue_box_1 in room_1. Check.

- Step9: purple_door_1 unlocked. Check.

- Before step9 (unlocking purple_door_1), step4 was in front of red_ball_1. Check.

- Step19: in room_4. Check.

- Before step19, step7: holding blue_box_1, step15: green_door_1 unlocked. Check.

- Step18: grey_door_1 unlocked. Check.

- Step16: in room_3. Check.

- Step7-12: holding blue_box_1. Check.

- Step21: in front of grey_ball_3. Check.

- Before step21, step20: in front of empty. Check.

So all constraints are satisfied.

Now, let's count the steps. Is this the optimal plan? Maybe there's a shorter way, but given the constraints, this seems necessary. For example, unlocking purple_door_1 is required even though we don't use it, but the constraint says it must be unlocked. So even if we use grey_door_1 to enter room_4, we still need to unlock purple_door_1. Hence, the steps to unlock purple_door_1 are necessary.

Is there a shorter path? Let's see. For example, after unlocking purple_door_1 (step9), could we go directly to room_4 via purple_door_1 instead of going through room_3? But then we need to also unlock grey_door_1 and visit room_3. Because the constraints require visiting room_3 and unlocking grey_door_1. So even if we use purple_door_1 to get to room_4, we still need to go to room_3 and unlock grey_door_1. So that's unavoidable.

Alternatively, after step9 (unlock purple_door_1):

10. gotoroom room_2 room_4 purple_door_1 (enter room_4)

But then need to go to room_3 to unlock grey_door_1 and visit room_3.

But from room_4, the doors are purple_door_1 (room_2) and grey_door_1 (room_3). So to get to room_3, need to unlock grey_door_1. But grey_door_1 is locked. So from room_4, gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3, toggle it. But how to get to room_3?

But to toggle grey_door_1 from room_4, need to be in front of it. So:

After entering room_4 via purple_door_1:

10. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3

11. toggle grey_door_1

12. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1 (now in room_3)

But this requires additional steps. Also, need to ensure visiting room_3. But this approach may save steps. Let's see:

Alternative plan:

1. gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_1

2. toggle red_door_1

3. gotoroom room_2 room_1 red_door_1

4. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_1

5. gotoroom room_1 room_2 red_door_1

6. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_2

7. pick blue_box_1 room_2

8. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_4

9. toggle purple_door_1

10. gotoroom room_2 room_4 purple_door_1 (now in room_4)

11. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3

12. toggle grey_door_1

13. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1 (now in room_3)

14. gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_1

15. toggle green_door_1 (unlock?)

Wait, green_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3. So from room_3, gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_1. Then toggle to unlock.

But green_door_1 was initially locked. So now, in this plan, green_door_1 is unlocked. But the constraint for room_4 requires that when you are in room_4, you had earlier held blue_box_1 and green_door_1 was unlocked. So when we were in room_4 (step10), we need to have had green_door_1 unlocked earlier. But in this plan, green_door_1 is unlocked in step15, after being in room_4. So this violates the constraint.

Hence, this approach won't work. Therefore, the previous plan is necessary.

Thus, the first plan with 21 steps (as corrected) seems necessary. But perhaps some steps can be optimized. For example, after step12 (drop blue_box_1 in room_1), you are already in front of it (since drop places you in front of it). So maybe step13 (gotoobject blue_box_1) is redundant. Let's check:

Effect of drop x r: you are in front of x. So after step12 (drop blue_box_1 room_1), you are in front of it. So step13 is not needed. So we can eliminate step13.

So corrected steps:

After step12 (drop blue_box_1 room_1), you are in front of it. So the constraint "you are in front of blue_box_1 in room_1" is already satisfied at step12. Hence, step13 can be removed.

So the revised steps would be:

1. gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_1

2. toggle red_door_1

3. gotoroom room_2 room_1 red_door_1

4. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_1

5. gotoroom room_1 room_2 red_door_1

6. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_2

7. pick blue_box_1 room_2

8. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_4

9. toggle purple_door_1

10. gotoroom room_2 room_1 red_door_1

11. gotoempty

12. drop blue_box_1 room_1 (now in front of it)

13. gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3

14. toggle green_door_1

15. gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1

16. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4

17. toggle grey_door_1

18. gotoroom room_3 room_4 grey_door_1

19. gotoempty

20. gotoobject grey_ball_3 room_4

Now, step12 satisfies being in front of blue_box_1 in room_1. So step13 is gotodoor green_door_1, which requires being in room_1 and the door is connected. Valid.

This reduces the plan by one step. Now 20 steps.

Other optimizations? Let's see:

After step10 (gotoroom room_2 room_1 red_door_1), you are in room_1. To drop the box, you need to be in front of empty. So step11: gotoempty, step12: drop. So these steps are necessary.

Is there a way to avoid going back to room_1 after picking up blue_box_1? For example, after step7 (holding blue_box_1), instead of going to room_1, can we go to room_3 via green_door_1, but green_door_1 is locked. So we need to unlock green_door_1 first, which requires being in room_1. So no, because green_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3. So to unlock green_door_1, must be in room_1. Hence, the steps are necessary.

Thus, the current plan seems optimal with 20 steps. Let's write it in the required format.
