Okay, let's tackle this planning problem step by step. First, I need to understand the initial state and the goal. The agent starts in room_2, and the goal is to have a grey ball in room_4, be in room_4, and be in front of that grey ball. Also, all doors are initially locked, which complicates movement between rooms.

Looking at the objects, the grey balls are grey_ball_1 in room_1, grey_ball_2 in room_3, and grey_ball_3 already in room_4. The agent is in room_2 initially. The grey_ball_3 is already in room_4, so maybe that's the target. But the agent needs to be in room_4 in front of a grey ball. So, if grey_ball_3 is already there, maybe the plan is to go to room_4, pick it up, drop it again to be in front of it, but wait—the goal doesn't say the ball needs to be held, just present in room_4 and the agent in front of it. Since grey_ball_3 is already in room_4, maybe the agent just needs to get to room_4 and go in front of it. But how?

First, the doors are all locked. So the agent needs to unlock them. But to unlock a door, the agent must be in front of it and toggle it. So the steps would involve moving to a door, toggling it to unlock, then moving through.

Starting in room_2. The doors connected to room_2 are red_door_1 (connects to room_1) and purple_door_1 (connects to room_4). Also, room_2 is connected via purple_door_1 to room_4. But the purple_door_1 is locked. So, the agent needs to unlock it. To do that, the agent must go to purple_door_1 in room_2, which requires that there's no object blocking the position in front of the door. Are there any objects blocking doors in room_2? Let's check the initial state. In room_2, there's blue_box_1. If the blue_box_1 is blocking the door, then the agent can't go to the door until it's moved. Wait, the "goto door" action requires that there's no object blocking the position in front of d in the current room. So, if the blue_box_1 is in front of purple_door_1 in room_2, then the agent can't go to the door. But how do we know where the boxes are placed? The initial state just says "blue_box_1 is in room_2"—does that mean it's blocking a door? The problem statement doesn't specify, so maybe we can assume that the boxes are not blocking doors unless stated. So perhaps the agent can go to the door directly.

So, the plan could be:

1. Go to purple_door_1 in room_2 (using gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_4). But wait, the preconditions for gotodoor are that the agent is in a room connected by the door. Since the agent is in room_2, and purple_door_1 connects room_2 and room_4, that's okay. Then, toggle the door to unlock it. Then, use gotoroom room_2 room_4 purple_door_1 to move to room_4. Once in room_4, go to grey_ball_3 (gotoobject grey_ball_3 room_4). Then, the agent is in front of it, in room_4. That would satisfy the goal.

Wait, but the agent starts in room_2. Let's check the doors again. The purple_door_1 connects room_2 and room_4. So, the steps would be:

- gotoempty (to be in front of an empty spot, maybe not necessary, but perhaps the agent starts not in front of anything. Wait, the initial state says "you have visited room_2" but doesn't specify the agent's position. The actions require being in front of something to move, but maybe the initial position is unspecified. So perhaps the first action is gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_4. But is that possible? The agent is in room_2, and the door connects room_2 and room_4. The preconditions for gotodoor are met (in the correct room, no object blocking the door's position). Then toggle purple_door_1 (since the agent is in front of it after gotodoor). Then use gotoroom to move to room_4. Then gotoobject grey_ball_3 room_4. Then done.

But wait, the purple_door_1 is locked initially. So the agent needs to unlock it. So the steps are:

1. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_4
2. toggle purple_door_1 (unlocks it)
3. gotoroom room_2 room_4 purple_door_1
4. gotoobject grey_ball_3 room_4

But wait, after step 3, the agent is in room_4, but not in front of anything. Then step 4 would require being in room_4 to go to grey_ball_3, which is true. So that would work. But does grey_ball_3 need to be moved? The goal is that there's a grey ball in room_4, which is already true. So the agent just needs to be in room_4 and in front of it. So this plan would work. But let's check constraints. Are there any constraints mentioned? The problem says "a valid plan must abide by the following constraints"—but the user didn't list any constraints here. Wait, looking back, the original problem says "A valid plan for the abovementioned problem must abide by the following constraints:" but then nothing is listed. Maybe that's a formatting error. Assuming there are no additional constraints beyond the preconditions, the plan seems valid.

But wait, let's check if the doors are connected correctly. The connections are:

room_2 and room_4 connected via purple_door_1. So moving from room_2 to room_4 via purple_door_1 is possible once it's unlocked.

Another possible path: room_2 to room_1 via red_door_1, but that's locked. Or room_2 to room_4 via purple_door_1. So unlocking purple_door_1 is the shortest path.

So the plan would be:

gotoempty (maybe not needed if the agent can directly go to the door. Wait, the agent starts in room_2. To perform gotodoor, they need to be in the same room as the door. They are in room_2, which is connected via purple_door_1. So step 1: gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_4. Then toggle to unlock. Then gotoroom to room_4. Then gotoobject grey_ball_3 room_4. That's four steps. But is there a shorter way?

Alternatively, maybe the agent can pick up a key or something, but there are no keys mentioned. The doors are toggled by being in front of them. So the steps are necessary.

But wait, the initial state says that all doors are locked. So the agent has to toggle each door they need to pass through. But in this case, only the purple_door_1 needs to be unlocked to go from room_2 to room_4. Once that's done, the agent can move to room_4. So the steps are as above.

But let's verify each action's preconditions:

1. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_4: The agent is in room_2, which is connected to room_4 via purple_door_1. Also, no object is blocking the door's position in room_2. The initial state has blue_box_1 in room_2. If the blue_box_1 is not blocking the door, then this action is possible. Assuming that the box is not in front of the door, then this is okay. So step 1 is valid.

2. toggle purple_door_1: The agent is in front of the door after step 1, so this is allowed. Toggling it changes the door from locked to unlocked.

3. gotoroom room_2 room_4 purple_door_1: The agent is in room_2, which is connected to room_4 via purple_door_1, which is now unlocked. So this action is allowed. The agent moves to room_4.

4. gotoobject grey_ball_3 room_4: The agent is in room_4, and grey_ball_3 is in room_4. So this is allowed. Now the agent is in front of a grey ball in room_4, and in room_4. This meets the goal.

This seems like a valid plan with 4 steps. Is there a shorter plan? Let's see. For example, if the agent could go directly from room_2 to room_4 without unlocking any doors, but all doors are locked initially, so that's not possible. So the steps are necessary. Therefore, this is an optimal plan.
