Okay, let's tackle this planning problem step by step. The goal is to get a grey ball into room_4, be in room_4, and be in front of it. Also, there are several constraints to satisfy. First, let's understand the initial state and the goal.

Initial State:
- The agent is in room_2.
- Objects: 
  - room_1 has blue_box_1 (blue) and red_ball_1 (red).
  - room_2 has blue_ball_1 (blue) and yellow_box_1 (yellow).
  - room_3 has grey_box_1 (grey), purple_box_1 (purple), grey_ball_1 (grey).
  - room_4 has grey_ball_2 (grey).
- All doors are locked: green_door_1 (connects room_1 and room_2), yellow_door_1 (room_1 and room_3), grey_door_1 (room_2 and room_4), yellow_door_2 (room_3 and room_4).
  
Goal:
- There's a grey ball (v) in room_4, the agent is in room_4 and in front of v. Since room_4 already has grey_ball_2, maybe we can use that. But wait, the goal says "a ball v such that...", so maybe either of the grey balls. But grey_ball_2 is already in room_4. Wait, the initial state says grey_ball_2 is in room_4. So if that's the case, maybe the agent just needs to be in room_4 in front of grey_ball_2. But the problem is that all doors are locked. So how to get to room_4?

Constraints to satisfy:

1. At least once: holding blue_box_1 and red_ball_1 is in room_4.
2. At least once: either in front of blue_ball_1 or yellow_door_1 is unlocked.
3. At least once: either holding something or in front of purple_box_1.
4. At least once: grey_door_1 is locked.
5. If grey_door_1 is locked in state s, then yellow_box_1 must be in room_3 at s or after.
6. At least once: holding grey_ball_1.
7. At least once: in room_4.
8. If in room_4 at some state, there must be an earlier state where either blue_box_1 is in room_3 or in front of yellow_door_1.
9. At least once: in room_2.
10. If in room_2 in state s, then yellow_door_2 must be unlocked at s or after.

First, the main goal: agent in room_4, in front of a grey ball. Since grey_ball_2 is already in room_4, maybe we can just go to room_4 and stand in front of it. But how to get to room_4?

The doors from room_2 to room_4 is grey_door_1, which is locked. So we need to unlock it. To toggle a door, we need to be in front of it. So agent must go to grey_door_1 in room_2, toggle it to unlock. But the problem is, to go to the door, the position in front of it must not be blocked. Are there any objects blocking doors in the initial state?

In the initial state, the objects in rooms:

- room_2 has blue_ball_1 and yellow_box_1. Are these blocking doors? The problem states that doors can be blocked by objects. The doors in room_2 are green_door_1 (to room_1) and grey_door_1 (to room_4). So if in room_2, the positions in front of these doors are blocked by objects? For example, if blue_ball_1 or yellow_box_1 is in front of grey_door_1, then the agent can't goto the door until it's moved.

Wait, the preconditions for "goto door" require that there's no object blocking the position in front of the door in the current room. So, in room_2, if grey_door_1 is connected to room_4, then the position in front of grey_door_1 in room_2 must be clear. Are there any objects there? The initial state says blue_ball_1 and yellow_box_1 are in room_2. Unless they are positioned in front of the doors, which the problem doesn't specify. The problem doesn't mention the exact positions of objects except their rooms. So perhaps the doors are not blocked unless an object is explicitly in front. But according to the problem's initial state, objects are just in rooms, not necessarily blocking doors. So maybe the doors are unblocked initially. Therefore, the agent can go to grey_door_1 in room_2.

Wait, but the agent is in room_2. To goto the door, the agent can do "gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_4". The preconditions are that the agent is in a room connected by the door (room_2 is connected via grey_door_1 to room_4), and that the position in front of the door in room_2 is not blocked. Since the problem doesn't mention any objects blocking doors, maybe the initial positions are such that the doors are not blocked. So the agent can perform gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_4. Then toggle the door to unlock it. Then go through to room_4. Then gotoobject grey_ball_2 room_4. That would satisfy the goal.

But wait, the goal requires that "there is a ball v such that v is grey, in room_4, you are in room_4, and in front of v." Since grey_ball_2 is already in room_4, perhaps the plan is as simple as unlocking grey_door_1, moving to room_4, and then going to grey_ball_2. But let's check the constraints.

Constraints:

1. At least once: holding blue_box_1 and red_ball_1 is in room_4.

So, we need to have a state where the agent is holding blue_box_1 (which is initially in room_1) and red_ball_1 (initially in room_1) is in room_4. That means we need to move red_ball_1 to room_4 and pick up blue_box_1 at some point.

2. At least once: in front of blue_ball_1 (in room_2) or yellow_door_1 is unlocked.

3. At least once: holding something or in front of purple_box_1 (in room_3).

4. At least once: grey_door_1 is locked. Initially, it's locked, so maybe that's already satisfied. But maybe after unlocking, we need to lock it again. Wait, the constraint says "must hold in at least one state". So if the initial state has grey_door_1 locked, then that's already satisfied. But the problem states that the initial state has all doors locked, including grey_door_1. So constraint 4 is already satisfied in the initial state. However, we need to make sure that in our plan, this isn't violated by unlocking it and not relocking. But the constraint just requires that in at least one state, it's locked. Since the initial state is part of the plan, that's already covered. So maybe we don't need to do anything for constraint 4.

5. If grey_door_1 is locked in state s, then yellow_box_1 must be in room_3 at s or after. So whenever grey_door_1 is locked (like in the initial state), we need to ensure that yellow_box_1 (which is in room_2 initially) is moved to room_3 either at that state or later. So in the initial state, since grey_door_1 is locked, we must ensure that yellow_box_1 is moved to room_3 at some point. So we need to move yellow_box_1 from room_2 to room_3.

6. At least once: holding grey_ball_1 (in room_3).

7. At least once: in room_4.

8. If in room_4, there must be a prior state where blue_box_1 is in room_3 or agent was in front of yellow_door_1. Since blue_box_1 starts in room_1, moving it to room_3 would satisfy the first part. Alternatively, being in front of yellow_door_1 (which connects room_1 and room_3) would satisfy the second part.

9. At least once: in room_2. The agent starts in room_2, so that's already satisfied. But if the agent leaves room_2 and comes back, that's okay. But since constraint 9 requires being in room_2 at least once, and the initial state is room_2, that's covered.

10. If in room_2 in state s, then yellow_door_2 must be unlocked at s or after. So whenever the agent is in room_2 (like the initial state), they need to unlock yellow_door_2 eventually. But yellow_door_2 connects room_3 and room_4. To unlock it, the agent must go to that door (from room_3 or room_4) and toggle it. However, the agent starts in room_2. So unless they go through other doors, they can't reach yellow_door_2. Wait, but constraint 10 says that whenever the agent is in room_2 in state s, then in s or a later state, yellow_door_2 must be unlocked. The initial state is room_2, and yellow_door_2 is locked. So we need to ensure that yellow_door_2 is unlocked at some point after the initial state.

But how to reach yellow_door_2? It's between room_3 and room_4. So the agent would need to go from room_2 to room_4 (via grey_door_1), then to room_3 via yellow_door_2? But yellow_door_2 is locked. Alternatively, go from room_2 to room_1 via green_door_1 (which is locked), then to room_3 via yellow_door_1 (locked), etc. But all doors are locked initially. So the agent needs to unlock doors.

Let me try to outline a possible plan step by step, considering all constraints.

First, the agent is in room_2. To unlock grey_door_1 (which is in room_2 leading to room_4), the agent can:

1. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_4 (assuming the door is not blocked)
2. toggle grey_door_1 (unlocks it)
3. gotoroom room_2 room_4 grey_door_1 (now in room_4)
4. gotoobject grey_ball_2 room_4

This would achieve the goal. But check constraints:

Constraint 1: Need to have a state where agent is holding blue_box_1 and red_ball_1 is in room_4. This isn't addressed here. So we need to incorporate moving red_ball_1 to room_4 and picking up blue_box_1.

Constraint 5: Since grey_door_1 is locked in the initial state, yellow_box_1 (in room_2) must be moved to room_3. So we need to move yellow_box_1 from room_2 to room_3.

Constraint 6: Must hold grey_ball_1 (which is in room_3) at least once.

Constraint 8: If in room_4 (step 3), then there must be an earlier state where blue_box_1 is in room_3 or in front of yellow_door_1. So before going to room_4, we need to either have blue_box_1 in room_3 (which is not the case, since it's in room_1) or be in front of yellow_door_1 (which is in room_1 and room_3). But to be in front of yellow_door_1, the agent must be in room_1 or room_3. But the agent starts in room_2, which is connected via green_door_1 to room_1. So perhaps the agent can go to room_1 via green_door_1, but green_door_1 is locked. So to unlock green_door_1, the agent can goto the door in room_2 (green_door_1 connects room_1 and room_2). So:

But in the initial plan above, the agent unlocks grey_door_1 and goes to room_4. To satisfy constraint 8, before entering room_4, the agent must have either blue_box_1 in room_3 (which it's not) or have been in front of yellow_door_1. So the agent needs to visit yellow_door_1 at some point before entering room_4.

So perhaps the agent needs to first go to room_1, unlock green_door_1, then go to room_1, then go to yellow_door_1 (which connects room_1 and room_3), toggle it, go to room_3, etc.

But this is getting complicated. Let's try to outline steps that satisfy all constraints.

Constraints:

- Must unlock yellow_door_2 (connects room_3 and room_4) after being in room_2. Since constraint 10 says that whenever the agent is in room_2, yellow_door_2 must be unlocked at that state or later. The agent starts in room_2, so we need to unlock yellow_door_2 eventually.

But yellow_door_2 is in room_3 and room_4. To unlock it, the agent must be in front of it. So the agent needs to reach room_3 or room_4, then goto that door and toggle.

But room_4 can be reached via grey_door_1 (if unlocked), but unlocking grey_door_1 may require moving yellow_box_1 to room_3 (due to constraint 5).

Wait, constraint 5 says if grey_door_1 is locked in state s, then yellow_box_1 is in room_3 at s or after. In the initial state, grey_door_1 is locked, so we need yellow_box_1 (in room_2) to be moved to room_3 at some point. So we need to move yellow_box_1 to room_3.

So steps required:

1. Move yellow_box_1 from room_2 to room_3.

But to move it, the agent needs to pick it up in room_2, carry it to room_3, and drop it.

But how to get to room_3 from room_2? The doors are:

- From room_2, doors are green_door_1 to room_1 and grey_door_1 to room_4. To get to room_3, the agent would need to go from room_1 via yellow_door_1 to room_3, or from room_4 via yellow_door_2 to room_3.

But all doors are locked initially. So the agent must unlock doors.

Let's think:

1. Unlock green_door_1 (connects room_2 and room_1) to get to room_1.

But green_door_1 is in room_2 and room_1, and is locked. To toggle it, the agent must be in front of it. So in room_2, the agent can:

- goto green_door_1 (gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_1)
- toggle green_door_1 (unlock)
- then go to room_1.

Once in room_1, can go to yellow_door_1 (connecting room_1 and room_3), unlock it, then go to room_3.

But let's outline steps:

1. In room_2:
   a. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_1
   b. toggle green_door_1 (unlocks)
   c. gotoroom room_2 room_1 green_door_1 (now in room_1)
   d. Now, in room_1, need to unlock yellow_door_1 (connecting to room_3)
   e. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3
   f. toggle yellow_door_1 (unlock)
   g. gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1 (now in room_3)
   h. Now in room_3, can pick up grey_ball_1 (constraint 6)
   i. pick grey_ball_1 room_3
   j. Then, need to move yellow_box_1 from room_2 to room_3. So agent needs to go back to room_2, get yellow_box_1, bring it to room_3.

But agent is in room_3. To go back to room_2:

From room_3, can go back to room_1 via yellow_door_1, then to room_2 via green_door_1.

But let's see:

k. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1 (in room_3)
l. toggle yellow_door_1 (to keep it unlocked)
m. gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_1 (back to room_1)
n. Then goto green_door_1 in room_1
o. gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_2
p. toggle green_door_1 (already unlocked)
q. gotoroom room_1 room_2 green_door_1 (back to room_2)
r. Now, pick up yellow_box_1 in room_2:
   - gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_2
   - pick yellow_box_1 room_2
s. Then carry it to room_3:
   - go back to room_1 via green_door_1 (but already unlocked)
   t. goto green_door_1 in room_2 again
   u. gotoroom room_2 room_1 green_door_1 (now in room_1)
   v. goto yellow_door_1 in room_1
   w. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3
   x. toggle yellow_door_1 (if locked again? No, we toggled it once to unlock, so now it's unlocked)
   y. gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1 (now in room_3)
   z. drop yellow_box_1 in room_3: since agent is holding it, needs to be in room_3 and in front of empty spot.
   aa. gotoempty (in room_3)
   ab. drop yellow_box_1 room_3

Now, yellow_box_1 is in room_3, satisfying constraint 5 (since grey_door_1 was locked in the initial state, and now yellow_box_1 is moved to room_3 after).

But this is getting very long. Let's check other constraints.

Constraint 1: Need to hold blue_box_1 and have red_ball_1 in room_4.

Blue_box_1 is in room_1. To pick it up, the agent needs to go to room_1, gotoobject blue_box_1, pick it up. Then, red_ball_1 is in room_1; to move it to room_4, the agent needs to carry it.

But the agent can carry only one object at a time. So perhaps:

After moving yellow_box_1 to room_3, go back to room_1, pick up blue_box_1, then go to room_4 via some path. But room_4 is connected to room_2 via grey_door_1 (which is locked initially). So need to unlock grey_door_1. But to unlock grey_door_1, the agent must be in front of it in room_2.

But after moving yellow_box_1 to room_3, the agent can then go back to room_2, unlock grey_door_1, and proceed to room_4. But also, constraint 8 requires that before entering room_4, the agent must have either blue_box_1 in room_3 (which isn't yet, unless we move it) or have been in front of yellow_door_1.

Wait, in the steps above, when the agent went to room_3 via yellow_door_1, they were in front of yellow_door_1 (step e and f). So if the agent has already been in front of yellow_door_1 before going to room_4, that satisfies constraint 8. So when they go to room_4 via grey_door_1, the prior state of being in front of yellow_door_1 would satisfy constraint 8.

So let's outline:

After step ab (yellow_box_1 is in room_3), the agent is in room_3. They need to go to room_4 via yellow_door_2 (connects room_3 and room_4), but that's locked. So they need to unlock it. So:

ac. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_3 room_4
ad. toggle yellow_door_2 (unlocks)
ae. gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_2 (now in room_4)
af. Now in room_4, which satisfies constraint 7. Then need to be in front of grey_ball_2.

But the agent is in room_4. They can:

ag. gotoobject grey_ball_2 room_4
ah. Now in front of it. So the goal is achieved.

But wait, the goal is to have a grey ball in room_4 (already there), agent in room_4, and in front of it. So steps ae, ag would do that.

But we also need to handle constraint 1: holding blue_box_1 and red_ball_1 in room_4.

So perhaps after moving yellow_box_1, the agent needs to go back to room_1, pick up blue_box_1, then carry it to room_4. Also, move red_ball_1 to room_4.

But this requires more steps.

Let's try:

After step ab (yellow_box_1 in room_3), agent in room_3.

Then, to get blue_box_1 and red_ball_1:

Go back to room_1 via yellow_door_1:

ac. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1
ad. toggle (already unlocked)
ae. gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_1 (now in room_1)

Now, in room_1, pick up blue_box_1:

af. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1
ag. pick blue_box_1 room_1

Then, carry it to room_4. But how?

From room_1, can go to room_2 via green_door_1 (already unlocked), then to room_4 via grey_door_1 (which is locked initially, but the agent hasn't unlocked it yet). Wait, the agent hasn't unlocked grey_door_1 yet. So need to do that.

So after picking up blue_box_1, go to room_2:

ah. gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_2
ai. gotoroom room_1 room_2 green_door_1 (now in room_2)

Then, unlock grey_door_1:

aj. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_4
ak. toggle grey_door_1 (unlocks)
al. gotoroom room_2 room_4 grey_door_1 (now in room_4)

Now, in room_4, holding blue_box_1. Then, need to drop it here? Or maybe drop red_ball_1 here.

Wait, constraint 1 requires that in some state, the agent is holding blue_box_1 and red_ball_1 is in room_4. So red_ball_1 is initially in room_1. So the agent needs to move red_ball_1 to room_4.

But the agent is currently holding blue_box_1. To pick up red_ball_1, they need to drop blue_box_1 first.

So steps:

am. drop blue_box_1 room_4 (requires being in front of empty spot)
an. gotoempty in room_4
ao. drop blue_box_1 room_4 (now blue_box_1 is in room_4)
ap. Now, agent is free to pick up red_ball_1. But red_ball_1 is in room_1. So agent needs to go back to room_1.

But this is getting too long. Maybe there's a better way.

Alternatively, after picking up blue_box_1 in room_1 (step ag), the agent can carry it to room_4 via grey_door_1 (after unlocking). Then, drop it in room_4, then go back to room_1, pick up red_ball_1, and carry it to room_4.

But this would require multiple trips. Let's try:

After step ag (holding blue_box_1 in room_1):

ah. goto green_door_1 in room_1
ai. gotoroom room_1 room_2 green_door_1 (now in room_2)
aj. goto grey_door_1 in room_2
ak. toggle grey_door_1 (unlock)
al. gotoroom room_2 room_4 grey_door_1 (now in room_4)
am. drop blue_box_1 in room_4 (needs to gotoempty first)
an. gotoempty in room_4
ao. drop blue_box_1 room_4 (blue_box_1 now in room_4)
ap. Now, agent needs to go back to room_1 to get red_ball_1.

From room_4, go back to room_2 via grey_door_1 (unlocked), then to room_1 via green_door_1 (unlocked).

aq. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_2
ar. toggle (already unlocked)
as. gotoroom room_4 room_2 grey_door_1 (back to room_2)
at. goto green_door_1 in room_2
au. gotoroom room_2 room_1 green_door_1 (back to room_1)
av. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_1
aw. pick red_ball_1 room_1 (now holding it)
ax. Carry it to room_4:

ay. goto green_door_1 in room_1
az. gotoroom room_1 room_2 green_door_1 (room_2)
ba. goto grey_door_1 in room_2
bb. gotoroom room_2 room_4 grey_door_1 (room_4)
bc. drop red_ball_1 in room_4: gotoempty, then drop.

bd. gotoempty room_4
be. drop red_ball_1 room_4

Now, in this state, the agent has dropped red_ball_1 in room_4, and previously was holding blue_box_1. So in step ao, the agent dropped blue_box_1 in room_4, then in step be, red_ball_1 is in room_4. So the state where the agent was holding blue_box_1 (step ag to ao) and red_ball_1 was in room_1. That doesn't satisfy constraint 1. Because constraint 1 requires that in some state, the agent is holding blue_box_1 AND red_ball_1 is in room_4. So during the time the agent is holding blue_box_1 (from ag to ao), red_ball_1 is still in room_1. So that's not sufficient.

Therefore, the agent needs to be holding blue_box_1 while red_ball_1 is in room_4. To do this, after moving red_ball_1 to room_4, the agent can pick up blue_box_1 again, but that would require going back to room_1, which is time-consuming. Alternatively, maybe the agent can carry both objects, but they can only hold one at a time. So this approach isn't possible.

Alternative plan: After moving red_ball_1 to room_4, the agent can go back to room_1, pick up blue_box_1, and return to room_4. But during the time the agent is holding blue_box_1, red_ball_1 is already in room_4. So that would satisfy constraint 1.

Let me adjust:

After step be (red_ball_1 in room_4), agent is in room_4.

bf. goto green_door_1 in room_4? Wait, room_4 is connected via grey_door_1 to room_2 and via yellow_door_2 to room_3.

Wait, room_4's doors are grey_door_1 (to room_2) and yellow_door_2 (to room_3). So from room_4, to go to room_1, agent must go through room_2 and then room_1.

So:

bf. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_2
bg. toggle (unlocked)
bh. gotoroom room_4 room_2 grey_door_1 (back to room_2)
bi. goto green_door_1 in room_2
bj. gotoroom room_2 room_1 green_door_1 (room_1)
bk. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1 (which is in room_4 now? Wait, no. Earlier steps had blue_box_1 dropped in room_4 (step ao). So blue_box_1 is in room_4. Oh wait, no: in step ao, blue_box_1 was dropped in room_4. So in room_1, blue_box_1 is no longer there. So this approach won't work. The agent can't pick up blue_box_1 in room_1 anymore because it's already in room_4.

So this approach is flawed. Therefore, to satisfy constraint 1, the agent must pick up blue_box_1 in room_1, then carry it to room_4, while also moving red_ball_1 to room_4. Since they can't carry both at the same time, they need to make two trips.

But this complicates the plan. Maybe there's a smarter way.

Alternative idea: While the agent is holding blue_box_1, they can drop it in room_4, then pick up red_ball_1 and move it to room_4. But during the time they are holding blue_box_1, red_ball_1 is still in room_1, so constraint 1 isn't met. However, after dropping blue_box_1 in room_4 and picking up red_ball_1, when they are carrying red_ball_1 to room_4, blue_box_1 is already in room_4. So the state where they are holding red_ball_1 and blue_box_1 is in room_4 doesn't satisfy constraint 1 (which requires holding blue_box_1 and red_ball_1 in room_4). So that's not sufficient.

Hmm. To satisfy constraint 1, there must be a state where both conditions are true at the same time. So the agent must be holding blue_box_1, and red_ball_1 must be in room_4. So perhaps:

The agent picks up blue_box_1 in room_1, carries it to room_4 (via room_2 and grey_door_1), drops it, then picks up red_ball_1 in room_1, carries it to room_4. During the time the agent is carrying red_ball_1, blue_box_1 is in room_4. But the agent isn't holding blue_box_1 then, so constraint 1 isn't met.

Alternatively, the agent picks up red_ball_1 first, takes it to room_4, drops it, then goes back to room_1, picks up blue_box_1. While holding blue_box_1, red_ball_1 is in room_4. That would satisfy constraint 1.

So steps:

1. Unlock green_door_1 (room_2 to room_1)
2. Go to room_1, pick up red_ball_1
3. Go back to room_2, unlock grey_door_1, go to room_4, drop red_ball_1
4. Go back to room_1, pick up blue_box_1, return to room_4.

But this requires multiple trips and dealing with other constraints.

But let's see:

Initial steps:

1. In room_2: gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_1
2. toggle green_door_1 (unlocks)
3. gotoroom room_2 room_1 green_door_1 (now in room_1)
4. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_1
5. pick red_ball_1 room_1
6. gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_2
7. gotoroom room_1 room_2 green_door_1 (room_2)
8. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_4
9. toggle grey_door_1 (unlocks)
10. gotoroom room_2 room_4 grey_door_1 (room_4)
11. gotoempty room_4
12. drop red_ball_1 room_4 (now red_ball_1 is in room_4)
13. Now, agent is in room_4, needs to go back to room_1 to get blue_box_1:
14. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_2
15. gotoroom room_4 room_2 grey_door_1 (room_2)
16. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_1
17. gotoroom room_2 room_1 green_door_1 (room_1)
18. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1
19. pick blue_box_1 room_1
20. Now, holding blue_box_1. At this moment, red_ball_1 is in room_4. So this satisfies constraint 1: holding blue_box_1 and red_ball_1 is in room_4.
21. Now, carry blue_box_1 to room_4:
22. gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_2
23. gotoroom room_1 room_2 green_door_1 (room_2)
24. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_4
25. gotoroom room_2 room_4 grey_door_1 (room_4)
26. drop blue_box_1 room_4 (optional, but constraint 1 is already satisfied in step 20)

Now, during step 20, the agent is holding blue_box_1 and red_ball_1 is in room_4. So constraint 1 is satisfied.

Other constraints:

Constraint 2: At least once, in front of blue_ball_1 (room_2) or yellow_door_1 unlocked. In the initial steps, we didn't address yellow_door_1. So if we unlock yellow_door_1, that would satisfy the condition. For example, when the agent is in room_1, after step 3, they can unlock yellow_door_1.

But let's see:

In the initial plan above, step 3 is in room_1. To unlock yellow_door_1:

3a. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3
3b. toggle yellow_door_1 (unlocks)
3c. Now, yellow_door_1 is unlocked, satisfying constraint 2 (since yellow_door_1 is unlocked, so the "or" condition is met).

Alternatively, if the agent is in front of blue_ball_1 in room_2. But blue_ball_1 is in room_2 initially. So in the initial state, if the agent goes to blue_ball_1 in room_2 before moving, that would satisfy constraint 2. Let's see:

Original plan steps:

1. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_1
But before that, the agent can:

0. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_2 (this would make them in front of blue_ball_1, satisfying constraint 2)

But then proceed with unlocking doors, etc. So inserting this step:

0. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_2 (now in front of it, satisfying constraint 2)
1. gotoempty (to leave front of blue_ball_1)
2. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_1
...

This way, constraint 2 is satisfied early on.

Constraint 3: At least once, holding something or in front of purple_box_1. Since the agent picks up red_ball_1 (step 5) and blue_box_1 (step 19), and possibly grey_ball_1, this is satisfied. Also, purple_box_1 is in room_3. If the agent goes to room_3 and is in front of purple_box_1, that also satisfies the condition. For example, when moving yellow_box_1 to room_3, the agent might need to be in front of purple_box_1. Alternatively, during any step in room_3, gotoobject purple_box_1.

But in the plan outlined earlier, when the agent is in room_3 to drop yellow_box_1, they can gotoobject purple_box_1, which would satisfy constraint 3.

Alternatively, when carrying grey_ball_1 (constraint 6), the agent is holding something, satisfying constraint 3.

Constraint 4: At least once, grey_door_1 is locked. Initially, it's locked. So this is satisfied in the initial state.

Constraint 5: When grey_door_1 is locked (initially), yellow_box_1 must be in room_3 at or after that state. So moving yellow_box_1 to room_3 satisfies this.

Constraint 6: Must hold grey_ball_1. This can be done when the agent is in room_3, they can pick it up.

Constraint 7: In room_4. Achieved when the agent goes there.

Constraint 8: Before entering room_4 (step 10), there must be an earlier state where blue_box_1 is in room_3 or in front of yellow_door_1. In the initial plan, the agent unlocks yellow_door_1 (step 3b), which requires being in front of it. So step 3a and 3b (gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3 and toggle) puts the agent in front of yellow_door_1. This happens before step 10 (entering room_4), so constraint 8 is satisfied.

Constraint 9: Being in room_2. The initial state and steps 7, 15, etc., cover this.

Constraint 10: Whenever in room_2 (steps 0, 7, 15, 23), yellow_door_2 must be unlocked at or after. So after being in room_2, the agent needs to unlock yellow_door_2. But yellow_door_2 is in room_3 and room_4. To unlock it, the agent must be in front of it. So after entering room_4 via grey_door_1, the agent can go to room_3 via yellow_door_2 (which is locked), unlock it, then return to room_4. Or perhaps unlock it when in room_3.

For example, after moving yellow_box_1 to room_3 (step ab), the agent is in room_3. They can then unlock yellow_door_2:

ac. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_3 room_4
ad. toggle yellow_door_2 (unlocks)
ae. Now, yellow_door_2 is unlocked, satisfying constraint 10 whenever the agent was in room_2 before.

But the agent was in room_2 in steps 0, 7, 15, 23. After step ae, yellow_door_2 is unlocked, so any subsequent states after that would satisfy the requirement for any room_2 visits. But if the agent is in room_2 again after unlocking yellow_door_2, then the constraint is satisfied.

But in the plan outlined earlier, after unlocking yellow_door_2 in room_3, the agent proceeds to room_4, and may not need to return to room_2. However, the initial steps involve multiple visits to room_2, but before yellow_door_2 is unlocked. So this may not satisfy constraint 10.

Wait, constraint 10 says that if the agent is in room_2 in state s, then yellow_door_2 must be unlocked at s or after. So every time the agent is in room_2, from that point onward, yellow_door_2 must eventually be unlocked. So for example, if the agent is in room_2 in step 7 (before yellow_door_2 is unlocked), then at some point after step 7, yellow_door_2 must be unlocked.

So the agent must unlock yellow_door_2 after any visit to room_2. Therefore, in the plan, after any visit to room_2, the agent must eventually unlock yellow_door_2.

This complicates things. For example, in the initial plan, after step 7 (agent is in room_2), they need to unlock yellow_door_2 later. But how? Because yellow_door_2 is in room_3 and room_4. So the agent needs to get to room_3 or room_4, unlock it, which requires going through other doors.

Alternatively, after step 7 (room_2), the agent proceeds to unlock grey_door_1 and go to room_4. Then, from room_4, unlock yellow_door_2.

For example:

After step 9 (unlock grey_door_1), go to room_4 (step 10), then:

10a. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_3
10b. toggle yellow_door_2 (unlocks)
10c. Now, yellow_door_2 is unlocked, satisfying constraint 10 for all previous visits to room_2.

Yes, because after step 7 (room_2), the agent later unlocks yellow_door_2 (step 10b), which is after step 7. So any visit to room_2 before step 10b would have yellow_door_2 unlocked afterward, satisfying the constraint.

Therefore, adding steps to unlock yellow_door_2 after entering room_4.

Putting all together, the plan would look something like:

1. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_2 (satisfies constraint 2)
2. gotoempty room_2
3. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_1
4. toggle green_door_1 (unlock)
5. gotoroom room_2 room_1 green_door_1 (now in room_1)
6. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3
7. toggle yellow_door_1 (unlock) (satisfies constraint 8 by being in front of yellow_door_1)
8. gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1 (now in room_3)
9. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_3
10. pick grey_ball_1 room_3 (satisfies constraint 6)
11. gotoempty room_3
12. drop grey_ball_1 room_3 (optional? Or keep holding to satisfy constraint 3)
13. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1
14. toggle yellow_door_1 (lock/unlock again? Not needed, just to pass through)
15. gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_1 (room_1)
16. gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_2
17. gotoroom room_1 room_2 green_door_1 (room_2)
18. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_2
19. pick yellow_box_1 room_2
20. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_1
21. gotoroom room_2 room_1 green_door_1 (room_1)
22. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3
23. gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1 (room_3)
24. gotoempty room_3
25. drop yellow_box_1 room_3 (satisfies constraint 5)
26. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_3 room_4
27. toggle yellow_door_2 (unlock) (to satisfy constraint 10)
28. gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_2 (room_4)
29. gotoobject grey_ball_2 room_4 (goal achieved)
30. Now, need to handle constraint 1: hold blue_box_1 and have red_ball_1 in room_4.
31. So go back to room_1 to get blue_box_1 and red_ball_1.

But this is getting very long. Let's try to streamline:

After step 25 (yellow_box_1 in room_3), agent is in room_3.

26. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_3 room_4
27. toggle yellow_door_2 (unlock) (now satisfies constraint 10 for any room_2 visits)
28. gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_2 (now in room_4)
29. Now in room_4, which satisfies constraint 7. Also, in front of yellow_door_2.

30. To satisfy the goal, gotoobject grey_ball_2 room_4.

But also need to handle constraint 1. So after this, agent needs to go back to room_1, pick up blue_box_1 and red_ball_1.

31. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_3
32. toggle yellow_door_2 (lock/unlock as needed)
33. gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_2 (room_3)
34. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1
35. gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_1 (room_1)
36. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_1
37. pick red_ball_1 room_1
38. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3
39. gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1 (room_3)
40. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_3 room_4
41. gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_2 (room_4)
42. drop red_ball_1 room_4 (now red_ball_1 is in room_4)
43. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_4 (assuming it's there, but it's not. Wait, blue_box_1 was initially in room_1, and hasn't been moved. So agent needs to pick it up from room_1.

This is getting too complex. Perhaps the optimal plan is longer than expected, but we need to find the shortest path that satisfies all constraints.

Alternatively, maybe there's a shorter path by leveraging the initial grey_ball_2 in room_4.

But the agent needs to unlock grey_door_1 to get to room_4. However, moving yellow_box_1 to room_3 is required due to constraint 5.

So steps:

1. In room_2, goto yellow_box_1 and pick it up.
2. Unlock green_door_1, go to room_1, then to room_3 via yellow_door_1 (unlock), drop yellow_box_1 there.
3. Return to room_2, unlock grey_door_1, go to room_4, then goto grey_ball_2.

But also need to satisfy other constraints.

Let's try:

1. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_2 (satisfies constraint 2 if blue_ball_1 is not in front, but yellow_box_1 is yellow. Wait, constraint 2 requires being in front of blue_ball_1 (which is in room_2) or yellow_door_1 unlocked. If the agent goes to yellow_box_1, that's not blue_ball_1, so they need to also unlock yellow_door_1.

Alternatively, after step 1, the agent is in front of yellow_box_1. Not helpful for constraint 2.

Hmm. It's clear that this problem requires a lengthy plan with multiple steps to satisfy all constraints. The challenge is to find the optimal (shortest) plan.

Considering time constraints, I'll attempt to outline the necessary steps in the optimal order, ensuring all constraints are met.

Final Plan Outline:

1. Unlock green_door_1 (room_2 to room_1)
2. Go to room_1, unlock yellow_door_1 (satisfies constraint 2 when unlocking it)
3. Go to room_3, pick grey_ball_1 (satisfies constraint 6)
4. Drop grey_ball_1 (optional, but needed to carry other items)
5. Return to room_2, pick yellow_box_1, move it to room_3 (satisfies constraint 5)
6. Unlock grey_door_1 in room_2, go to room_4
7. Toggle yellow_door_2 in room_4 to unlock (satisfies constraint 10)
8. Go to room_3 via yellow_door_2
9. Pick up purple_box_1 (to satisfy constraint 3 by being in front of it)
10. Return to room_4, drop purple_box_1
11. Unlock green_door_1 again if needed
12. Pick up red_ball_1 and move to room_4
13. Pick up blue_box_1 and move to room_4, ensuring constraint 1 is met

But this is still quite long. Given the complexity, the optimal plan would require careful sequencing to minimize steps while satisfying all constraints.

After careful consideration, here's the step-by-step plan:
