Okay, let's tackle this planning problem step by step. The goal is to find a sequence of actions that brings about the final situation while satisfying all the constraints. Let's start by understanding the problem thoroughly.

First, the initial state: the agent is in room_4. The doors blue_door_1, red_door_1, purple_door_1, and blue_door_2 are all locked. The objects are in various rooms as listed. The constraints are quite a few, so I need to make sure each one is addressed.

The final goal is that there's a blue door d connecting room_1 and room_2 (so that must be blue_door_1, since blue_door_1 connects room_1 and room_2), the agent is in front of d, and d is unlocked. So the main objectives here are to unlock blue_door_1, be in front of it, and ensure it's not locked. However, the agent starts in room_4, so they need to navigate through the rooms to get to blue_door_1.

But there are constraints to consider. Let's list them out:

1. The agent must never be in room_2. So any action that requires going to room_2 is impossible. Therefore, the agent can't use purple_door_1 (connects room_2 and room_4) to go to room_2. Also, the blue_door_1 connects room_1 and room_2, but since the agent can't enter room_2, they must stay in room_1 when dealing with blue_door_1.

2. At some point, the agent must be holding grey_ball_2. Since grey_ball_2 is in room_1 initially, the agent needs to get to room_1, pick it up, but then maybe drop it later if needed.

3. Purple_door_1 must always be locked. Since it's initially locked, we can't toggle it. So the agent can't use purple_door_1 to move between room_4 and room_2, which is already prohibited by constraint 1 anyway.

4. At some state, the agent must be in front of red_door_1 while holding yellow_box_1. yellow_box_1 is in room_1 initially, so the agent needs to go to room_1, pick it up, and then go to red_door_1 (which connects room_1 and room_3) to be in front of it.

5. At some point, grey_ball_1 must be in room_4 and the agent is in front of yellow_box_3. grey_ball_1 is initially in room_1, so the agent needs to move it to room_4. Since the agent can carry objects, they need to pick up grey_ball_1 in room_1, carry it to room_4, drop it there, and then be in front of yellow_box_3 (which is already in room_4).

6. At some state, the agent must be in front of blue_door_2 or holding yellow_box_3. Blue_door_2 connects room_3 and room_4. Since the agent starts in room_4, maybe they can go to blue_door_2 in room_4. Or pick up yellow_box_3 in room_4.

7. At some point, the agent must be in room_1 or holding some object. Since the agent needs to go to room_1 to handle blue_door_1 and other objects, this might be naturally satisfied during the plan.

Now, let's outline the steps needed to achieve the main goal while satisfying constraints.

First, the agent is in room_4. To get to room_1, they need to navigate through the doors. The doors connecting room_4 are purple_door_1 (to room_2, which is prohibited) and blue_door_2 (to room_3). Since room_2 is off-limits, the only way is to go through blue_door_2 to room_3, then from room_3 to room_1 via red_door_1. But red_door_1 is initially locked. So the agent needs to unlock red_door_1.

Wait, let's think. From room_4, the agent can go to room_3 via blue_door_2, but blue_door_2 is locked. So first, the agent must unlock blue_door_2. To toggle a door, the agent needs to be in front of it. So in room_4, the agent can go to blue_door_2 (gotodoor blue_door_2 room_4 room_3), then toggle it to unlock. Then, go through blue_door_2 to room_3.

Once in room_3, the next step is to get to room_1. The door connecting room_3 and room_1 is red_door_1, which is locked. So the agent needs to go to red_door_1 from room_3, toggle it to unlock, then go to room_1.

But wait, the agent is in room_3. To toggle red_door_1, they need to be in front of it. So in room_3, the agent can go to red_door_1 (gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1), then toggle it to unlock. Then, use gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1 to enter room_1.

Once in room_1, the agent can handle the blue_door_1. blue_door_1 connects room_1 and room_2. The agent can't go to room_2, so they must stay in room_1. To unlock blue_door_1, the agent needs to be in front of it in room_1, then toggle it. But blue_door_1 is initially locked. So steps would be: gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2, toggle blue_door_1 (unlocking it). Then, the agent is in front of blue_door_1, which is now unlocked, satisfying the goal.

But wait, the goal is that there exists a door d (blue_door_1) that is blue, connects room_1 and room_2, the agent is in front of it, and it's not locked. So after unlocking blue_door_1 and being in front of it in room_1, that would satisfy the goal.

But there are constraints to meet along the way.

Let's outline the steps:

1. Start in room_4. Need to get to room_1.

Path: room_4 -> room_3 (via blue_door_2), then room_3 -> room_1 (via red_door_1). But doors are locked, so need to unlock them.

So first, in room_4, go to blue_door_2 (gotodoor blue_door_2 room_4 room_3). Then toggle it (unlock). Then gotoroom room_4 room_3 blue_door_2 to move to room_3.

Then in room_3, go to red_door_1 (gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1), toggle to unlock. Then gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1 to enter room_1.

Once in room_1, the agent can go to blue_door_1 (gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2), toggle to unlock. Now, the agent is in front of blue_door_1, which is unlocked. This would satisfy the goal.

But along the way, we need to satisfy the constraints.

Let's check the constraints one by one:

Constraint 1: Never be in room_2. Our path doesn't go to room_2, so that's okay.

Constraint 2: At some point hold grey_ball_2. grey_ball_2 is in room_1. Once in room_1, the agent can gotoobject grey_ball_2 room_1, then pick it up. Then maybe drop it later.

Constraint 3: purple_door_1 is always locked. Since we never interact with purple_door_1 (it's in room_4 and room_2, which we avoid), it remains locked. So this is satisfied.

Constraint 4: At some state, be in front of red_door_1 while holding yellow_box_1. yellow_box_1 is in room_1. So after entering room_1, the agent can pick up yellow_box_1, then go to red_door_1. But red_door_1 is in room_1 connecting to room_3. To be in front of red_door_1 in room_1, the agent can gotoobject red_door_1 (but wait, red_door_1 is a door between room_1 and room_3. So in room_1, the agent can go to red_door_1 via gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3. Then, if they are holding yellow_box_1, that's the state needed. So steps: after entering room_1, pick up yellow_box_1, then go to red_door_1.

Constraint 5: grey_ball_1 in room_4 and agent in front of yellow_box_3. grey_ball_1 is in room_1. So the agent needs to pick it up in room_1, carry it to room_4, drop it there. Then go to yellow_box_3 (which is in room_4). But how to get back to room_4? The agent is in room_1. To return, they would need to go back through room_3. So perhaps after handling the main goal, but we need to plan for this.

Constraint 6: At some state, in front of blue_door_2 or holding yellow_box_3. Since the agent starts in room_4, they can go to blue_door_2 in room_4 (as part of unlocking it) which would satisfy the first part. Alternatively, pick up yellow_box_3 in room_4. But yellow_box_3 is in room_4; the agent could pick it up after dropping grey_ball_1.

Constraint 7: At some state, in room_1 or holding some object. Since the agent goes to room_1, this is naturally satisfied.

Now, let's try to outline the steps, integrating all constraints.

Step-by-step plan:

1. From room_4, go to blue_door_2 (gotodoor blue_door_2 room_4 room_3). Then toggle to unlock. Now, blue_door_2 is unlocked. Then, go to room_3 via gotoroom room_4 room_3 blue_door_2. Now in room_3.

2. In room_3, go to red_door_1 (gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1), toggle to unlock. Now red_door_1 is unlocked. Then go to room_1 via gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1. Now in room_1.

3. In room_1, pick up yellow_box_1 (gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_1, then pick yellow_box_1 room_1). Now holding yellow_box_1.

4. Now, need to be in front of red_door_1 while holding yellow_box_1. So gotoobject red_door_1 room_1 (but wait, red_door_1 is a door. So use gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3). Now in front of red_door_1. This satisfies constraint 4.

5. Next, need to pick up grey_ball_2 (constraint 2). So drop yellow_box_1 (gotoempty in room_1, then drop yellow_box_1 room_1). Then gotoobject grey_ball_2 room_1 and pick it up. Now holding grey_ball_2. This satisfies constraint 2.

6. Now, need to pick up grey_ball_1 as well to move it to room_4. So drop grey_ball_2 (gotoempty, drop grey_ball_2 room_1). Then gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_1, pick it up. Now holding grey_ball_1.

7. Now, need to take grey_ball_1 to room_4. To do that, go back to room_3 via red_door_1. Since red_door_1 is already unlocked, go to red_door_1 (gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3), then gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1. Now in room_3.

8. From room_3, go through blue_door_2 to room_4. But blue_door_2 is unlocked. So gotoempty in room_3 (to get in front of nothing?), wait, no. To go to blue_door_2 from room_3, need to use gotodoor blue_door_2 room_3 room_4. Then gotoroom room_3 room_4 blue_door_2. But wait, blue_door_2 connects room_3 and room_4. So in room_3, gotodoor blue_door_2 room_3 room_4, then gotoroom room_3 room_4 blue_door_2. Now back in room_4.

9. Now in room_4, drop grey_ball_1. Need to be in front of an empty position to drop. So gotoempty in room_4, then drop grey_ball_1 room_4. Now grey_ball_1 is in room_4. Then, go to yellow_box_3 (gotoobject yellow_box_3 room_4). Now in front of yellow_box_3. This satisfies constraint 5 (grey_ball_1 in room_4 and in front of yellow_box_3).

10. Now, need to handle the main goal: be in front of blue_door_1 (which is in room_1) and have it unlocked. But the agent is now in room_4. So they need to go back to room_1. Wait, but how? The agent is in room_4. To get back to room_1, they have to go through room_3 again. So:

11. From room_4, go through blue_door_2 to room_3 (gotodoor blue_door_2 room_4 room_3, then gotoroom room_4 room_3 blue_door_2). Then from room_3, go through red_door_1 to room_1 (gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1, then gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1). Now back in room_1.

12. Now, go to blue_door_1 in room_1 (gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2). Then toggle it (since it's initially locked, this unlocks it). Now, the agent is in front of blue_door_1, which is blue, connects room_1 and room_2, and is unlocked. This satisfies the main goal.

Now, let's check all constraints again:

- Never in room_2: yes.
- Held grey_ball_2: yes, in step 5.
- purple_door_1 remains locked: yes, never touched.
- Held yellow_box_1 in front of red_door_1: yes, step 4.
- grey_ball_1 in room_4 and in front of yellow_box_3: yes, step 9.
- Either in front of blue_door_2 or holding yellow_box_3: When the agent was in room_4 after dropping grey_ball_1, they went to yellow_box_3 (step 9). Alternatively, when they first went to blue_door_2 in step 1, they were in front of blue_door_2. So this is satisfied.
- In room_1 or holding an object: The agent is in room_1 multiple times, so this is satisfied.

But wait, the agent might have to pick up yellow_box_3 to satisfy the sixth constraint. Let's see. In step 9, the agent is in front of yellow_box_3. So the sixth constraint requires that in at least one state, they are in front of blue_door_2 or holding yellow_box_3. Being in front of yellow_box_3 doesn't satisfy holding it. So if the agent just goes in front of it, that's not enough. However, in step 1, when the agent goes to blue_door_2 (gotodoor blue_door_2 room_4 room_3), they are in front of blue_door_2, which satisfies the condition. So step 1 satisfies the sixth constraint as well. So that's covered.

Now, the plan steps as outlined may have redundant steps, but we need to make sure it's optimal (shortest possible). Let's count the steps:

Let's list the actions:

1. gotodoor blue_door_2 room_4 room_3
2. toggle blue_door_2
3. gotoroom room_4 room_3 blue_door_2
4. gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1
5. toggle red_door_1
6. gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1
7. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_1
8. pick yellow_box_1 room_1
9. gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3
10. toggle red_door_1 (Wait, no, after unlocking red_door_1 in step 5, it's unlocked. So step 9 is just moving to the door, not toggling again. Wait, no, step 9 is gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3. Then, the agent is in front of red_door_1. Then, perhaps after step 8, they need to go to red_door_1 while holding yellow_box_1. So step 9 is gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3. So step 9 is just moving to the door. Then, the state after step 9 is: holding yellow_box_1, in front of red_door_1. That satisfies constraint 4.

Then, after that, step 10 would be drop yellow_box_1 (but need to drop it). Wait, no. Wait, to drop, the agent needs to be in front of an empty position. So after step 9, the agent is in front of red_door_1, holding yellow_box_1. To drop it, they need to go to an empty position. But maybe instead, after step 8 (holding yellow_box_1), they can go to red_door_1 (step 9), which satisfies constraint 4, and then proceed to drop it.

But then, after satisfying constraint 4, they need to pick up grey_ball_2. So steps after step 9 would be:

10. gotoempty room_1
11. drop yellow_box_1 room_1
12. gotoobject grey_ball_2 room_1
13. pick grey_ball_2 room_1
14. gotoempty room_1
15. drop grey_ball_2 room_1
16. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_1
17. pick grey_ball_1 room_1
18. gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3
19. gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1
20. gotodoor blue_door_2 room_3 room_4
21. gotoroom room_3 room_4 blue_door_2
22. gotoempty room_4
23. drop grey_ball_1 room_4
24. gotoobject yellow_box_3 room_4
25. gotodoor blue_door_2 room_4 room_3
26. gotoroom room_4 room_3 blue_door_2
27. gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1
28. gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1
29. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2
30. toggle blue_door_1

That's a lot of steps. Maybe there's a shorter way.

Alternative approach: Can we combine some steps?

For example, after unlocking blue_door_2 and red_door_1, go to room_1, handle the objects, and then return. Let's see.

Another idea: After step 6 (in room_1), pick up yellow_box_1 (steps 7-8), then go to red_door_1 (step 9), which satisfies constraint 4. Then, instead of dropping yellow_box_1, can we keep it until needed? But we need to pick up grey_ball_2. So perhaps:

After step 9 (in front of red_door_1, holding yellow_box_1), drop yellow_box_1 (requires gotoempty, drop). Then pick up grey_ball_2. Then pick up grey_ball_1. But this adds steps.

Alternatively, maybe use the yellow_box_1 to satisfy another constraint and then drop it.

Wait, but the agent needs to be holding grey_ball_2 at some point. So they have to drop yellow_box_1 to pick up grey_ball_2.

Alternatively, after satisfying constraint 4, the agent can drop yellow_box_1 in front of red_door_1. But to drop, the agent needs to be in front of an empty position. So they have to gotoempty, then drop.

Let's see:

After step 8 (holding yellow_box_1):

9. gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3 (now in front of red_door_1, holding yellow_box_1 → satisfies constraint 4)

10. gotoempty room_1

11. drop yellow_box_1 room_1

12. gotoobject grey_ball_2 room_1

13. pick grey_ball_2 room_1 (satisfies constraint 2)

14. gotoempty room_1

15. drop grey_ball_2 room_1

16. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_1

17. pick grey_ball_1 room_1

Then proceed to take grey_ball_1 to room_4.

But this seems lengthy. Is there a way to optimize?

Alternatively, after step 13 (holding grey_ball_2), can the agent carry it to room_4 and drop it there, but that would require moving through room_3 and room_4. But that would require additional steps. Maybe not necessary. Because the constraint just requires that at some point, the agent is holding grey_ball_2. So once they pick it up (step 13), that's satisfied. They can drop it immediately.

So steps 13-15 can be:

13. pick grey_ball_2 room_1 (now holding it → satisfies constraint 2)

14. gotoempty room_1

15. drop grey_ball_2 room_1

Then proceed to pick up grey_ball_1.

Alternatively, maybe after picking up grey_ball_2, the agent can carry it to room_4. But that would take more steps.

But the constraint is "at least one state" where holding grey_ball_2. So just picking it up and then dropping it is sufficient.

So steps 7-17:

7. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_1

8. pick yellow_box_1 room_1

9. gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3 (satisfy constraint 4)

10. gotoempty room_1

11. drop yellow_box_1 room_1

12. gotoobject grey_ball_2 room_1

13. pick grey_ball_2 room_1 (satisfy constraint 2)

14. gotoempty room_1

15. drop grey_ball_2 room_1

16. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_1

17. pick grey_ball_1 room_1

Then, take grey_ball_1 to room_4:

18. gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3

19. gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1

20. gotodoor blue_door_2 room_3 room_4

21. gotoroom room_3 room_4 blue_door_2 (now in room_4)

22. gotoempty room_4

23. drop grey_ball_1 room_4 (now grey_ball_1 is in room_4)

24. gotoobject yellow_box_3 room_4 (satisfy constraint 5)

Then, return to room_1 to unlock blue_door_1:

25. gotodoor blue_door_2 room_4 room_3

26. gotoroom room_4 room_3 blue_door_2

27. gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1

28. gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1

29. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2

30. toggle blue_door_1 (now unlocked)

This is a long sequence. Is there a way to shorten this?

Wait, maybe after step 23 (grey_ball_1 in room_4 and in front of yellow_box_3), the agent is in room_4, in front of yellow_box_3. Then, to get back to room_1, they have to go through room_3 again. But perhaps after step 24, they can go to blue_door_2, then room_3, then room_1.

But each movement through doors requires gotodoor and gotoroom.

Alternatively, after step 24 (in front of yellow_box_3), the agent can go to blue_door_2 in room_4 (gotodoor blue_door_2 room_4 room_3), then go to room_3, then to room_1 via red_door_1.

But in any case, the steps are necessary.

Is there a more optimal path?

Let me think again. The main goal is to have blue_door_1 unlocked and be in front of it. So perhaps after step 6 (entering room_1), the agent can immediately go to blue_door_1, toggle it, and that's it. But then they need to satisfy other constraints.

Wait, but other constraints require actions in room_1, such as picking up yellow_box_1 and grey_ball_2, moving grey_ball_1 to room_4, etc.

So perhaps the agent can first unlock blue_door_1 and be in front of it, satisfying the main goal, then handle the other constraints. But then, after that, the agent needs to pick up objects, which requires moving around, but since the main goal is already achieved, but the plan must include all steps until the goal is achieved.

Wait, no. The plan must achieve the goal state, and the constraints must hold during the execution of the plan. So the constraints are on all states (for some) or at least one state (for others). So the plan must include steps that satisfy all constraints in their required temporal conditions.

But the main goal is the final state. So the plan must end with the agent in front of blue_door_1, which is unlocked, and all constraints are satisfied during the execution.

But perhaps the main goal can be achieved early, and then the remaining steps handle the constraints. However, some constraints require that certain conditions hold in at least one state, which could be during or after the main goal is achieved.

But the plan must end when the goal is achieved, so all constraints must be satisfied in the sequence of actions up to that point.

Wait, no. The planning problem is to bring about the final goal situation, and the constraints must hold in the states visited during the plan. So the plan is a sequence of actions that starts from the initial state and ends in a state where the goal is true, with all intermediate states satisfying the constraints.

So the plan must end when the goal is achieved. Therefore, the last action should be the one that makes the goal true.

In this case, the goal is "there exists a door d (blue, connecting room_1 and room_2) such that the agent is in front of d and it's unlocked."

So the last action should be either toggling blue_door_1 to unlock it (if it's locked) while being in front of it, or moving in front of it after it's unlocked.

But blue_door_1 is initially locked. So the agent needs to be in front of it and toggle it to unlock it. That action would make it unlocked, and the agent remains in front of it. Therefore, the last action should be "toggle blue_door_1", which would both unlock it and leave the agent in front of it.

Therefore, the plan should end with:

gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2

toggle blue_door_1

But after toggling, the agent is in front of blue_door_1, which is now unlocked. So this would achieve the goal.

But before that, the agent must have handled all constraints.

So perhaps the optimal plan is:

1. Unlock blue_door_2 and go to room_3.

2. Unlock red_door_1 and go to room_1.

3. Pick up yellow_box_1, go to red_door_1 (satisfy constraint 4).

4. Drop yellow_box_1, pick up grey_ball_2 (satisfy constraint 2).

5. Pick up grey_ball_1, take it to room_4, drop it, go to yellow_box_3 (satisfy constraint 5).

6. Return to room_1, go to blue_door_1, toggle it (unlock) to achieve the goal.

But integrating all these steps efficiently.

Let's try to outline this:

1. gotodoor blue_door_2 room_4 room_3

2. toggle blue_door_2

3. gotoroom room_4 room_3 blue_door_2

4. gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1

5. toggle red_door_1

6. gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1

7. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_1

8. pick yellow_box_1 room_1

9. gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3 (now in front of red_door_1, holding yellow_box_1 → constraint 4)

10. gotoempty room_1

11. drop yellow_box_1 room_1

12. gotoobject grey_ball_2 room_1

13. pick grey_ball_2 room_1 (constraint 2)

14. gotoempty room_1

15. drop grey_ball_2 room_1

16. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_1

17. pick grey_ball_1 room_1

18. gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3

19. gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1

20. gotodoor blue_door_2 room_3 room_4

21. gotoroom room_3 room_4 blue_door_2

22. gotoempty room_4

23. drop grey_ball_1 room_4

24. gotoobject yellow_box_3 room_4 (constraint 5)

25. gotodoor blue_door_2 room_4 room_3

26. gotoroom room_4 room_3 blue_door_2

27. gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1

28. gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1

29. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2

30. toggle blue_door_1 (achieve goal)

This is 30 actions. But perhaps some steps can be optimized.

For example, after step 24 (in front of yellow_box_3 in room_4), constraint 5 is satisfied. Then, the agent needs to return to room_1 to toggle blue_door_1. Steps 25-29 are to go back to room_1.

But maybe there's a shorter path. However, given the room connections, the agent must go through room_3 each time.

Alternatively, after step 23 (grey_ball_1 dropped in room_4), the agent can immediately go to blue_door_2 in room_4 (step 24: gotodoor blue_door_2 room_4 room_3), then go to room_3 (step 25: gotoroom room_4 room_3 blue_door_2). Then go to red_door_1 (step 26: gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1), then room_1 (step 27: gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1). Then go to blue_door_1 (step 28: gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2), toggle (step 29: toggle blue_door_1). That's 29 steps.

But perhaps even shorter. Let's see.

Wait, after dropping grey_ball_1 in room_4 (step 23), the agent is in room_4. They need to get back to room_1. So steps:

24. gotodoor blue_door_2 room_4 room_3

25. gotoroom room_4 room_3 blue_door_2

26. gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1

27. gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1

28. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2

29. toggle blue_door_1

So steps 24-29 are 6 actions. But in between, after step 23, the agent needs to be in front of yellow_box_3 (constraint 5: grey_ball_1 in room_4 and in front of yellow_box_3). So after step 23, the agent must go to yellow_box_3. So steps after 23:

23. drop grey_ball_1 room_4

24. gotoobject yellow_box_3 room_4 (now in front of it → satisfies constraint 5)

25. gotodoor blue_door_2 room_4 room_3

26. gotoroom room_4 room_3 blue_door_2

27. gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1

28. gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1

29. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2

30. toggle blue_door_1

So this adds step 24 (gotoobject yellow_box_3), making it 30 steps. But this is necessary for constraint 5.

Is there a way to satisfy constraint 5 during an earlier step?

When the agent is in room_4 after dropping grey_ball_1 (step 23), they need to be in front of yellow_box_3. So they have to do step 24: gotoobject yellow_box_3 room_4.

But yellow_box_3 is in room_4, so this is possible.

Now, checking constraint 6: at some state, in front of blue_door_2 or holding yellow_box_3. Step 25: gotodoor blue_door_2 room_4 room_3 → in front of blue_door_2. So this satisfies constraint 6. Alternatively, step 24: in front of yellow_box_3. But the constraint is "at least one of the conditions is true". So either is sufficient. However, step 1 was gotodoor blue_door_2, which also satisfies constraint 6. So perhaps during step 1, the agent is in front of blue_door_2, which covers constraint 6. Therefore, step 24 may not be necessary for constraint 6, but is necessary for constraint 5.

So regardless, step 24 is needed for constraint 5.

Now, the total steps are 30. Is this the shortest possible?

Alternatively, can we combine some actions?

For example, after step 17 (holding grey_ball_1), the agent needs to go to room_4. Instead of going through red_door_1 and blue_door_2, is there a faster way? No, because the agent is in room_1, and the only doors are blue_door_1 (to room_2, which is prohibited) and red_door_1 (to room_3). So the path is necessary.

Another optimization: when the agent is in room_1 after step 17, they need to go to red_door_1 (step 18: gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3), then move to room_3 (step 19), then to blue_door_2 (step 20: gotodoor blue_door_2 room_3 room_4), then to room_4 (step 21). So steps 18-21: four actions.

But can these be shortened? For example, can the agent go from room_1 to room_4 directly? No, because the doors connect room_1 to room_2 and room_3, and room_4 to room_2 and room_3. So the only path is room_1 → room_3 → room_4.

Therefore, steps 18-21 are necessary.

So overall, it's unlikely to shorten the plan further. However, perhaps there's a way to satisfy multiple constraints with fewer steps.

Wait, constraint 6 requires that at some state, the agent is in front of blue_door_2 or holding yellow_box_3. When the agent first unlocks blue_door_2 (step 1: gotodoor blue_door_2 room_4 room_3), they are in front of blue_door_2. This satisfies constraint 6. So even if the agent never picks up yellow_box_3, this constraint is satisfied. But constraint 5 requires that at some state, grey_ball_1 is in room_4 and the agent is in front of yellow_box_3. So step 24 is necessary.

Another observation: when the agent is in room_4 after dropping grey_ball_1 (step 23), they can go to yellow_box_3 (step 24), which is in room_4, and then proceed to the door. So step 24 is necessary.

But maybe after step 24, the agent can proceed to toggle blue_door_1 without returning to room_1. No, because blue_door_1 is in room_1.

Alternatively, is there a way to toggle blue_door_1 from room_4? No, because the agent must be in front of blue_door_1, which is in room_1 or room_2 (but room_2 is prohibited). So the agent must be in room_1 to interact with blue_door_1.

So the steps are necessary.

Therefore, the plan as outlined is likely optimal. But let's count the steps again:

The steps are:

1. gotodoor blue_door_2 room_4 room_3

2. toggle blue_door_2

3. gotoroom room_4 room_3 blue_door_2

4. gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1

5. toggle red_door_1

6. gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1

7. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_1

8. pick yellow_box_1 room_1

9. gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3

10. gotoempty room_1

11. drop yellow_box_1 room_1

12. gotoobject grey_ball_2 room_1

13. pick grey_ball_2 room_1

14. gotoempty room_1

15. drop grey_ball_2 room_1

16. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_1

17. pick grey_ball_1 room_1

18. gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3

19. gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1

20. gotodoor blue_door_2 room_3 room_4

21. gotoroom room_3 room_4 blue_door_2

22. gotoempty room_4

23. drop grey_ball_1 room_4

24. gotoobject yellow_box_3 room_4

25. gotodoor blue_door_2 room_4 room_3

26. gotoroom room_4 room_3 blue_door_2

27. gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1

28. gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1

29. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2

30. toggle blue_door_1

This is 30 actions. But perhaps some steps can be merged or eliminated.

Wait, after step 9 (in front of red_door_1, holding yellow_box_1), constraint 4 is satisfied. Then, to drop yellow_box_1, the agent needs to go to an empty position (step 10). But perhaps instead of dropping it, the agent can carry it to room_4 and drop it there, but that would require more steps. Alternatively, maybe they can drop it in room_1 and leave it there. Since the constraint is satisfied when they are holding it in front of red_door_1, dropping it later is acceptable.

Another possible optimization: after step 9 (satisfying constraint 4), can the agent carry yellow_box_1 to room_4 and use it to satisfy other constraints? For example, drop it in room_4, but that requires extra steps. Probably not.

Another idea: when the agent is in room_4 after step 21, they drop grey_ball_1 (step 23), then go to yellow_box_3 (step 24). But yellow_box_3 is in room_4, so they can gotoobject yellow_box_3 room_4 directly. Then, they need to return to room_1. But perhaps after step 24, the agent can go to blue_door_2 (step 25), which is in room_4, then go to room_3 (step 26), then to room_1 (step 27-28), then to blue_door_1 (step 29-30). These steps are necessary.

Is there a way to avoid going back to room_1 twice? For example, after handling the constraints, can the agent go directly to blue_door_1? But they need to be in room_1 to interact with blue_door_1.

So, I think the plan as outlined is necessary. Therefore, the optimal plan is 30 actions. However, maybe there's a smarter way.

Alternative approach: After step 8 (holding yellow_box_1), instead of going to red_door_1, can the agent use yellow_box_1 to unlock blue_door_1? No, because unlocking doors requires toggling while in front of them.

Wait, but the agent needs to be in front of red_door_1 while holding yellow_box_1 to satisfy constraint 4. So they must go there.

Another idea: Maybe after unlocking blue_door_1 (step 30), the agent is in front of it, which is the goal. But all constraints must be satisfied during the plan. So perhaps some constraints can be satisfied after achieving the goal. But no, the plan must end when the goal is achieved. So all constraints must be satisfied in the actions leading up to the goal.

Therefore, the steps are necessary.

Given that, the plan must include all these steps. However, perhaps some steps can be reordered or combined. For example, when moving between rooms, the agent can combine gotodoor and gotoroom steps.

But each action is separate. So the plan is as outlined.

Now, let's check if all constraints are satisfied:

- Constraint 1: Never in room_2. Yes.

- Constraint 2: Hold grey_ball_2 in step 13.

- Constraint 3: purple_door_1 remains locked. Yes, never touched.

- Constraint 4: In step 9, holding yellow_box_1 in front of red_door_1.

- Constraint 5: In step 24, grey_ball_1 is in room_4 (step 23) and agent is in front of yellow_box_3 (step 24).

- Constraint 6: In step 1, agent is in front of blue_door_2.

- Constraint 7: Agent is in room_1 multiple times (steps 6-17, 28-30).

Therefore, all constraints are satisfied.

But the plan is quite long. Is there a way to make it shorter?

Alternative idea: After step 8 (holding yellow_box_1), go to red_door_1 (step 9), which satisfies constraint 4. Then, instead of dropping yellow_box_1, use it to block a door, but the problem states that when you pick up an object, it's no longer blocking a door. But maybe that's not relevant here.

Alternatively, after step 9, the agent can take yellow_box_1 to room_4 and drop it there, but that requires additional steps.

Alternatively, after satisfying constraint 4, the agent can carry yellow_box_1 to room_4, drop it, and then pick up grey_ball_1. But this would require more steps.

But the current plan is already handling this.

Another possible optimization: After step 17 (holding grey_ball_1), the agent goes to room_4 and drops it, then goes to yellow_box_3. But how does that save steps? It doesn't.

Another thought: When the agent is in room_4 after step 21, they can drop grey_ball_1 and then immediately go to yellow_box_3, which is in the same room. That's what steps 22-24 do.

Another possible optimization: Combine the actions of dropping grey_ball_1 and going to yellow_box_3. But each action must be separate. So steps 23 and 24 are separate.

Therefore, I think the plan is as optimal as possible. However, perhaps there's a shorter way to handle grey_ball_1 and grey_ball_2.

Wait, the agent needs to pick up grey_ball_2 (step 13) and then drop it (step 15), then pick up grey_ball_1 (step 17). But maybe the agent can pick up grey_ball_2 and carry it to room_4 along with grey_ball_1. But that would require carrying two objects, which is impossible since the agent can only carry one at a time.

So the steps are necessary.

In conclusion, the plan outlined meets all constraints and achieves the goal in the minimal number of steps possible.
