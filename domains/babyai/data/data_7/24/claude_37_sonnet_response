Let me first understand the initial state, goal, and constraints.

Initial State:
- I am in room_4.
- Various objects are in different rooms (grey_ball_1, grey_ball_2, red_box_1, yellow_box_1 in room_1, grey_ball_3, blue_ball_1, yellow_box_2 in room_3, yellow_box_3 in room_4).
- All doors (blue_door_1, red_door_1, purple_door_1, blue_door_2) are locked.
- I am not holding any object.
- I have visited room_4.

Goal:
- There is a blue door d connecting room_1 and room_2 (which is blue_door_1).
- I am in front of that door.
- The door is unlocked.

Constraints:
1. I should never be in room_2.
2. At some point, I should be holding grey_ball_2.
3. purple_door_1 should always remain locked.
4. At some point, I should be in front of red_door_1 while holding yellow_box_1.
5. At some point, grey_ball_1 should be in room_4 and I should be in front of yellow_box_3.
6. At some point, I should either be in front of blue_door_2 or holding yellow_box_3.
7. At some point, I should either be in room_1 or holding some object.

Now, let's plan a sequence of actions to reach the goal while satisfying all constraints.

First, let's think about the layout of the rooms:
- room_1 (north-west) is connected to room_2 (south-west) via blue_door_1
- room_1 (north-west) is connected to room_3 (north-east) via red_door_1
- room_2 (south-west) is connected to room_4 (south-east) via purple_door_1
- room_3 (north-east) is connected to room_4 (south-east) via blue_door_2

Since I start in room_4 and can never be in room_2 (constraint 1), and purple_door_1 must always be locked (constraint 3), my only path to room_1 (where the target door is) is through room_3, which I can access from room_4 via blue_door_2.

Let's plan a high-level approach:
1. Unlock blue_door_2 to access room_3.
2. Satisfy constraint 6 by being in front of blue_door_2 or holding yellow_box_3.
3. Move to room_3.
4. In room_3, I might need some objects. I can pick up objects to satisfy constraint 7 if needed.
5. Unlock red_door_1 to access room_1.
6. Move to room_1.
7. In room_1, pick up yellow_box_1 and grey_ball_2 to satisfy constraints 2 and 4.
8. Go to red_door_1 with yellow_box_1 to satisfy constraint 4.
9. Move back to room_4 with grey_ball_1 to satisfy constraint 5.
10. Be in front of yellow_box_3 in room_4 while grey_ball_1 is there to satisfy constraint 5.
11. Return to room_1.
12. Unlock blue_door_1 (the door connecting room_1 and room_2).
13. Go in front of blue_door_1 (the goal).

Let's now detail these steps:

Start in room_4:
1. `gotodoor blue_door_2 room_4 room_3` - Go to blue_door_2 which connects room_4 and room_3.
   - This also satisfies constraint 6 by being in front of blue_door_2.
2. `toggle blue_door_2` - Unlock blue_door_2.
3. `gotoroom room_4 room_3 blue_door_2` - Move to room_3.

Now in room_3:
4. `gotoobject yellow_box_2 room_3` - Go to yellow_box_2.
5. `pick yellow_box_2 room_3` - Pick up yellow_box_2.
   - This satisfies constraint 7 by holding an object.
6. `gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1` - Go to red_door_1 which connects room_3 and room_1.
7. `toggle red_door_1` - Unlock red_door_1.
8. `gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1` - Move to room_1.

Now in room_1:
9. `gotoempty` - Go to an empty position.
10. `drop yellow_box_2 room_1` - Drop yellow_box_2.
11. `gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_1` - Go to yellow_box_1.
12. `pick yellow_box_1 room_1` - Pick up yellow_box_1.
13. `gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3` - Go to red_door_1 while holding yellow_box_1.
    - This satisfies constraint 4 by being in front of red_door_1 while holding yellow_box_1.
14. `gotoempty` - Go to an empty position to drop yellow_box_1.
15. `drop yellow_box_1 room_1` - Drop yellow_box_1.
16. `gotoobject grey_ball_2 room_1` - Go to grey_ball_2.
17. `pick grey_ball_2 room_1` - Pick up grey_ball_2.
    - This satisfies constraint 2 by holding grey_ball_2.
18. `gotoempty` - Go to an empty position.
19. `drop grey_ball_2 room_1` - Drop grey_ball_2.
20. `gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_1` - Go to grey_ball_1.
21. `pick grey_ball_1 room_1` - Pick up grey_ball_1.
22. `gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3` - Go to red_door_1.
23. `gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1` - Move to room_3.

Now in room_3:
24. `gotodoor blue_door_2 room_3 room_4` - Go to blue_door_2.
25. `gotoroom room_3 room_4 blue_door_2` - Move to room_4.

Now in room_4:
26. `gotoempty` - Go to an empty position.
27. `drop grey_ball_1 room_4` - Drop grey_ball_1. Now grey_ball_1 is in room_4.
28. `gotoobject yellow_box_3 room_4` - Go to yellow_box_3.
    - This satisfies constraint 5 by having grey_ball_1 in room_4 and being in front of yellow_box_3.
29. `pick yellow_box_3 room_4` - Pick up yellow_box_3.
    - This also satisfies constraint 6 again by holding yellow_box_3.
30. `gotodoor blue_door_2 room_4 room_3` - Go to blue_door_2.
31. `gotoroom room_4 room_3 blue_door_2` - Move to room_3.

Now in room_3:
32. `gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1` - Go to red_door_1.
33. `gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1` - Move to room_1.

Now in room_1:
34. `gotoempty` - Go to an empty position.
35. `drop yellow_box_3 room_1` - Drop yellow_box_3.
36. `gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2` - Go to blue_door_1.
37. `toggle blue_door_1` - Unlock blue_door_1.

At this point, I am in room_1, in front of blue_door_1, which is unlocked. This satisfies the goal.

Let me check if all constraints are satisfied:

1. I never enter room_2. ✓
2. At some point, I hold grey_ball_2 (step 17). ✓
3. purple_door_1 always remains locked. ✓
4. At some point, I am in front of red_door_1 while holding yellow_box_1 (step 13). ✓
5. At some point, grey_ball_1 is in room_4 and I am in front of yellow_box_3 (step 28). ✓
6. At some point, I am in front of blue_door_2 (step 1) or holding yellow_box_3 (step 29). ✓
7. At some point, I am in room_1 (step 8 onwards) or holding an object (various steps). ✓

All constraints are satisfied, and the goal is achieved.

Let me review the steps again to make sure they are valid and optimal.

Actually, I think there are some issues with my plan. Let me revise it to make sure we're actually satisfying all the constraints correctly.

I'll redo the plan, step-by-step, ensuring each action's preconditions are met and effects are tracked properly.

Starting state:
- I am in room_4.
- All doors are locked.
- I'm not holding any objects.

Here's a revised plan:

1. `gotoobject yellow_box_3 room_4` - Go to yellow_box_3 in room_4.
2. `pick yellow_box_3 room_4` - Pick up yellow_box_3.
   - This satisfies constraint 6 (I am holding yellow_box_3) and constraint 7 (I am holding some object).
3. `gotodoor blue_door_2 room_4 room_3` - Go to blue_door_2.
4. `toggle blue_door_2` - Unlock blue_door_2.
5. `gotoroom room_4 room_3 blue_door_2` - Go to room_3.
   - Now I'm in room_3, holding yellow_box_3.
6. `gotoempty` - Go to an empty position in room_3.
7. `drop yellow_box_3 room_3` - Drop yellow_box_3 in room_3.
8. `gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1` - Go to red_door_1.
9. `toggle red_door_1` - Unlock red_door_1.
10. `gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1` - Go to room_1.
    - Now I'm in room_1, satisfying part of constraint 7.
11. `gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_1` - Go to yellow_box_1.
12. `pick yellow_box_1 room_1` - Pick up yellow_box_1.
13. `gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3` - Go to red_door_1.
    - This satisfies constraint 4 (I am in front of red_door_1 and holding yellow_box_1).
14. `gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1` - Go to room_3.
15. `gotodoor blue_door_2 room_3 room_4` - Go to blue_door_2.
    - This satisfies constraint 6 again (I am in front of blue_door_2).
16. `gotoroom room_3 room_4 blue_door_2` - Go to room_4.
17. `gotoempty` - Go to an empty position in room_4.
18. `drop yellow_box_1 room_4` - Drop yellow_box_1 in room_4.
19. `gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_4` - Go to yellow_box_1.
20. `gotodoor blue_door_2 room_4 room_3` - Go to blue_door_2.
21. `gotoroom room_4 room_3 blue_door_2` - Go to room_3.
22. `gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1` - Go to red_door_1.
23. `gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1` - Go to room_1.
24. `gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_1` - Go to grey_ball_1.
25. `pick grey_ball_1 room_1` - Pick up grey_ball_1.
26. `gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3` - Go to red_door_1.
27. `gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1` - Go to room_3.
28. `gotodoor blue_door_2 room_3 room_4` - Go to blue_door_2.
29. `gotoroom room_3 room_4 blue_door_2` - Go to room_4.
30. `gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_4` - Go to yellow_box_1 in room_4.
31. `gotoempty` - Go to an empty position in room_4.
32. `drop grey_ball_1 room_4` - Drop grey_ball_1 in room_4. Now grey_ball_1 is in room_4.
33. `gotodoor blue_door_2 room_4 room_3` - Go to blue_door_2.
34. `gotoroom room_4 room_3 blue_door_2` - Go to room_3.
35. `gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1` - Go to red_door_1.
36. `gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1` - Go to room_1.
37. `gotoobject grey_ball_2 room_1` - Go to grey_ball_2.
38. `pick grey_ball_2 room_1` - Pick up grey_ball_2.
    - This satisfies constraint 2 (I am holding grey_ball_2).
39. `gotoempty` - Go to an empty position in room_1.
40. `drop grey_ball_2 room_1` - Drop grey_ball_2 in room_1.
41. `gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2` - Go to blue_door_1.
42. `toggle blue_door_1` - Unlock blue_door_1.
    - Now blue_door_1 is unlocked.
43. `gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3` - Go to red_door_1.
44. `gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1` - Go to room_3.
45. `gotodoor blue_door_2 room_3 room_4` - Go to blue_door_2.
46. `gotoroom room_3 room_4 blue_door_2` - Go to room_4.

Wait, I realize I've made a mistake here. We need to satisfy constraint 5: At some point, grey_ball_1 should be in room_4 and I should be in front of yellow_box_3. But when I dropped grey_ball_1 in room_4, I didn't go in front of yellow_box_3.

Let's revise the plan again, carefully tracking all constraints:

I'm still missing constraint 5. Let me add another step to go in front of yellow_box_3 when grey_ball_1 is in room_4.

Also, I think there is an issue. The goal state requires me to be in room_1, in front of blue_door_1, with blue_door_1 unlocked. Let me check if I've arranged that correctly.

In the goal, we need:
"There is a door d such that "The following conditions are all true: "d is blue", "room_1 and room_2 are connected via d", "you are in front of d", "d is not locked"""

So we need:
1. A blue door (blue_door_1) that connects room_1 and room_2.
2. I am in front of that door.
3. The door is unlocked.

I've incorrectly thought I should be in room_4 at the end. I should actually end in room_1, in front of blue_door_1.

Let me redo the plan with the correct goal and all constraints in mind, step by step.

Start: I am in room_4. All doors are locked.

1. `gotodoor blue_door_2 room_4 room_3` - Go to blue_door_2 which connects room_4 and room_3.
   - This satisfies constraint 6 (I am in front of blue_door_2).
2. `toggle blue_door_2` - Unlock blue_door_2.
3. `gotoroom room_4 room_3 blue_door_2` - Move to room_3.
4. `gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1` - Go to red_door_1.
5. `toggle red_door_1` - Unlock red_door_1.
6. `gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1` - Move to room_1.
   - This satisfies constraint 7 (I am in room_1).
7. `gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_1` - Go to yellow_box_1.
8. `pick yellow_box_1 room_1` - Pick up yellow_box_1.
   - This also satisfies constraint 7 (I am holding some object).
9. `gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3` - Go to red_door_1 while holding yellow_box_1.
   - This satisfies constraint 4 (I am in front of red_door_1 and holding yellow_box_1).
10. `gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1` - Go to room_3.
11. `gotodoor blue_door_2 room_3 room_4` - Go to blue_door_2.
12. `gotoroom room_3 room_4 blue_door_2` - Go to room_4.
13. `gotoempty` - Go to an empty position in room_4.
14. `drop yellow_box_1 room_4` - Drop yellow_box_1 in room_4.
15. `gotodoor blue_door_2 room_4 room_3` - Go to blue_door_2.
16. `gotoroom room_4 room_3 blue_door_2` - Go to room_3.
17. `gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1` - Go to red_door_1.
18. `gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1` - Go to room_1.
19. `gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_1` - Go to grey_ball_1.
20. `pick grey_ball_1 room_1` - Pick up grey_ball_1.
21. `gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3` - Go to red_door_1.
22. `gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1` - Go to room_3.
23. `gotodoor blue_door_2 room_3 room_4` - Go to blue_door_2.
24. `gotoroom room_3 room_4 blue_door_2` - Go to room_4.
25. `gotoempty` - Go to an empty position in room_4.
26. `drop grey_ball_1 room_4` - Drop grey_ball_1 in room_4. Now grey_ball_1 is in room_4.
27. `gotoobject yellow_box_3 room_4` - Go to yellow_box_3 in room_4.
    - This satisfies constraint 5 (grey_ball_1 is in room_4 and I am in front of yellow_box_3).
28. `pick yellow_box_3 room_4` - Pick up yellow_box_3.
    - This satisfies constraint 6 again (I am holding yellow_box_3).
29. `gotodoor blue_door_2 room_4 room_3` - Go to blue_door_2.
30. `gotoroom room_4 room_3 blue_door_2` - Go to room_3.
31. `gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1` - Go to red_door_1.
32. `gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1` - Go to room_1.
33. `gotoempty` - Go to an empty position in room_1.
34. `drop yellow_box_3 room_1` - Drop yellow_box_3 in room_1.
35. `gotoobject grey_ball_2 room_1` - Go to grey_ball_2.
36. `pick grey_ball_2 room_1` - Pick up grey_ball_2.
    - This satisfies constraint 2 (I am holding grey_ball_2).
37. `gotoempty` - Go to an empty position in room_1.
38. `drop grey_ball_2 room_1` - Drop grey_ball_2 in room_1.
39. `gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2` - Go to blue_door_1.
40. `toggle blue_door_1` - Unlock blue_door_1.

This completes the plan. I am now in room_1, in front of blue_door_1, which is unlocked. This satisfies the goal.

Let me check if all constraints are satisfied:

1. I never enter room_2. ✓
2. At some point, I hold grey_ball_2 (step 36). ✓
3. purple_door_1 always remains locked. ✓
4. At some point, I am in front of red_door_1 while holding yellow_box_1 (step 9). ✓
5. At some point, grey_ball_1 is in room_4 and I am in front of yellow_box_3 (steps 26-27). ✓
6. At some point, I am in front of blue_door_2 (step 1) or holding yellow_box_3 (step 28). ✓
7. At some point, I am in room_1 (step 6) or holding an object (various steps). ✓

All constraints are satisfied, and the goal is achieved.

Let me review one more time to see if there's any further optimization possible.

I think the current plan is optimal. We've satisfied all constraints while taking the shortest path to the goal.

I am aware there was a slight inefficiency. We did not need to go back and pick up yellow_box_3 in room_4 only to drop it back in room_1, but I wanted to be extra sure constraint 5 was satisfied by going in front of yellow_box_3 while grey_ball_1 was in room_4. If we really want to optimize, we could:

1. After dropping grey_ball_1 in room_4 (step 26), go in front of yellow_box_3 (step 27) to satisfy constraint 5, then proceed directly to picking up grey_ball_2 in room_1 instead of moving yellow_box_3. This would skip steps 28-34.

That would shorten the plan to 33 steps.

Actually, I realize we could shorten this even further. Since we don't need to pick up and transport grey_ball_1, we could just leave it in room_1, go to room_4, pick up yellow_box_3, then go back to room_1, in front of blue_door_1, and unlock it.

Let me create a more streamlined plan:

1. `gotodoor blue_door_2 room_4 room_3` - Go to blue_door_2.
   - This satisfies constraint 6 (I am in front of blue_door_2).
2. `toggle blue_door_2` - Unlock blue_door_2.
3. `gotoroom room_4 room_3 blue_door_2` - Go to room_3.
4. `gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1` - Go to red_door_1.
5. `toggle red_door_1` - Unlock red_door_1.
6. `gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1` - Go to room_1.
   - This satisfies constraint 7 (I am in room_1).
7. `gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_1` - Go to yellow_box_1.
8. `pick yellow_box_1 room_1` - Pick up yellow_box_1.
9. `gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3` - Go to red_door_1 while holding yellow_box_1.
   - This satisfies constraint 4 (I am in front of red_door_1 and holding yellow_box_1).
10. `gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1` - Go to room_3.
11. `gotodoor blue_door_2 room_3 room_4` - Go to blue_door_2.
12. `gotoroom room_3 room_4 blue_door_2` - Go to room_4.
13. `gotoempty` - Go to an empty position in room_4.
14. `drop yellow_box_1 room_4` - Drop yellow_box_1 in room_4.
15. `gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_1` - Wait, this doesn't work. grey_ball_1 is still in room_1, not room_4. I need to revise my plan.

Hmm, I think my original plan might be close to optimal after all. Let me create a revised plan:

1. `gotodoor blue_door_2 room_4 room_3` - Go to blue_door_2.
   - This satisfies constraint 6 (I am in front of blue_door_2).
2. `toggle blue_door_2` - Unlock blue_door_2.
3. `gotoroom room_4 room_3 blue_door_2` - Go to room_3.
4. `gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1` - Go to red_door_1.
5. `toggle red_door_1` - Unlock red_door_1.
6. `gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1` - Go to room_1.
   - This satisfies constraint 7 (I am in room_1).
7. `gotoobject grey_ball_2 room_1` - Go to grey_ball_2.
8. `pick grey_ball_2 room_1` - Pick up grey_ball_2.
   - This satisfies constraint 2 (I am holding grey_ball_2).
9. `gotoempty` - Go to an empty position in room_1.
10. `drop grey_ball_2 room_1` - Drop grey_ball_2 in room_1.
11. `gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_1` - Go to grey_ball_1.
12. `pick grey_ball_1 room_1` - Pick up grey_ball_1.
13. `gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_1` - Go to yellow_box_1.
14. `gotoempty` - Go to an empty position in room_1.
15. `drop grey_ball_1 room_1` - Drop grey_ball_1 back in room_1.
16. `gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_1` - Go to yellow_box_1.
17. `pick yellow_box_1 room_1` - Pick up yellow_box_1.
18. `gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3` - Go to red_door_1 while holding yellow_box_1.
    - This satisfies constraint 4 (I am in front of red_door_1 and holding yellow_box_1).
19. `gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1` - Go to room_3.
20. `gotodoor blue_door_2 room_3 room_4` - Go to blue_door_2.
21. `gotoroom room_3 room_4 blue_door_2` - Go to room_4.
22. `gotoempty` - Go to an empty position in room_4.
23. `drop yellow_box_1 room_4` - Drop yellow_box_1 in room_4.
24. `gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_1` - This doesn't work. I need to first pick up grey_ball_1 from room_1 and take it to room_4. Let me revise again.

I think I got confused with my planning. Let me think step-by-step more carefully.

I need to satisfy constraint 5, which requires grey_ball_1 to be in room_4 and me to be in front of yellow_box_3. 

I think I need to:
1. Go to room_1 (via room_3).
2. Pick up grey_ball_1 in room_1.
3. Take it to room_4.
4. Drop it in room_4.
5. Go in front of yellow_box_3 in room_4.

This would satisfy constraint 5.

Let me rewrite the plan:

1. `gotodoor blue_door_2 room_4 room_3` - Go to blue_door_2.
   - This satisfies constraint 6 (I am in front of blue_door_2).
2. `toggle blue_door_2` - Unlock blue_door_2.
3. `gotoroom room_4 room_3 blue_door_2` - Go to room_3.
4. `gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1` - Go to red_door_1.
5. `toggle red_door_1` - Unlock red_door_1.
6. `gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1` - Go to room_1.
   - This satisfies constraint 7 (I am in room_1).
7. `gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_1` - Go to grey_ball_1.
8. `pick grey_ball_1 room_1` - Pick up grey_ball_1.
9. `gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3` - Go to red_door_1.
10. `gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1` - Go to room_3.
11. `gotodoor blue_door_2 room_3 room_4` - Go to blue_door_2.
12. `gotoroom room_3 room_4 blue_door_2` - Go to room_4.
13. `gotoempty` - Go to an empty position in room_4.
14. `drop grey_ball_1 room_4` - Drop grey_ball_1 in room_4.
15. `gotoobject yellow_box_3 room_4` - Go to yellow_box_3.
    - This satisfies constraint 5 (grey_ball_1 is in room_4 and I am in front of yellow_box_3).
16. `pick yellow_box_3 room_4` - Pick up yellow_box_3.
    - This also satisfies constraint 6 (I am holding yellow_box_3).
17. `gotodoor blue_door_2 room_4 room_3` - Go to blue_door_2.
18. `gotoroom room_4 room_3 blue_door_2` - Go to room_3.
19. `gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1` - Go to red_door_1.
20. `gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1` - Go to room_1.
21. `gotoempty` - Go to an empty position in room_1.
22. `drop yellow_box_3 room_1` - Drop yellow_box_3 in room_1.
23. `gotoobject grey_ball_2 room_1` - Go to grey_ball_2.
24. `pick grey_ball_2 room_1` - Pick up grey_ball_2.
    - This satisfies constraint 2 (I am holding grey_ball_2).
25. `gotoempty` - Go to an empty position in room_1.
26. `drop grey_ball_2 room_1` - Drop grey_ball_2 in room_1.
27. `gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_1` - Go to yellow_box_1.
28. `pick yellow_box_1 room_1` - Pick up yellow_box_1.
29. `gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3` - Go to red_door_1 while holding yellow_box_1.
    - This satisfies constraint 4 (I am in front of red_door_1 and holding yellow_box_1).
30. `gotoempty` - Go to an empty position in room_1.
31. `drop yellow_box_1 room_1` - Drop yellow_box_1 back in room_1.
32. `gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2` - Go to blue_door_1.
33. `toggle blue_door_1` - Unlock blue_door_1.

Now I am in room_1, in front of blue_door_1, which is unlocked. This satisfies the goal.

Let me check if all constraints are satisfied:

1. I never enter room_2. ✓
2. At some point, I hold grey_ball_2 (step 24). ✓
3. purple_door_1 always remains locked. ✓
4. At some point, I am in front of red_door_1 while holding yellow_box_1 (step 29). ✓
5. At some point, grey_ball_1 is in room_4 and I am in front of yellow_box_3 (steps 14-15). ✓
6. At some point, I am in front of blue_door_2 (step 1) or holding yellow_box_3 (step 16). ✓
7. At some point, I am in room_1 (step 6) or holding an object (various steps). ✓

All constraints are satisfied, and the goal is achieved.

I don't think we can further optimize this plan, so this is our final answer.
