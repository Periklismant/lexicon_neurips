Alright, let's understand the problem:

1. We're in a 2D gridworld with 4 rooms, and some doors connecting the rooms.
2. The rooms may have boxes and balls, each with a color.
3. We have a set of actions we can perform, each with preconditions and effects.
4. We are given an initial state of the world, and we need to reach a goal state.
5. We have a list of constraints that our plan must satisfy.

Let's first understand the goal:
"There is a door d such that "The following conditions are all true: "d is yellow", "you are in front of d", "d is not locked"""

This means we need to be in front of a door that is yellow and the door should be unlocked.

From the world description, there's only one yellow door: "yellow_door_1", and it's initially locked. So, we need to go to this door and unlock it.

Next, let's understand our initial position:
"you are in room_4" and "you have visited room_4"

Now, let's analyze the constraints one by one to understand what we must do during our plan:

1. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: "you are in room_4"" - We're already in room_4, so this constraint is satisfied.

2. "If expression "you are in room_4" holds in some state s, then expression "you are in front of purple_door_1" must hold at s or at some state after s" - Since we're already in room_4, we need to go in front of purple_door_1 at some point in our plan.

3. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: "you are in front of purple_door_2"" - We need to be in front of purple_door_2 at some point in our plan.

4. "If expression "you are in front of purple_door_2" holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: "At least one of the following conditions is true: "yellow_box_1 is in room_2", "you are holding green_box_1""" - Before we go in front of purple_door_2, we must either have yellow_box_1 in room_2 or be holding green_box_1.

5. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: "purple_door_2 is locked"" - purple_door_2 should be locked at some point in our plan (which is already the case initially).

6. "If expression "purple_door_2 is locked" holds in some state s, then expression "you are holding some object" must hold at s or at some state after s" - After (or at the same time as) purple_door_2 is locked, we need to be holding some object.

7. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: "purple_door_2 is not locked"" - At some point, purple_door_2 should be unlocked.

8. "If expression "purple_door_2 is not locked" holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: "At least one of the following conditions is true: "you are in room_3", "you are holding some object""" - Before purple_door_2 is unlocked, we must either be in room_3 or be holding some object.

9. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: "you are in front of purple_door_1"" - We need to be in front of purple_door_1 at some point in our plan.

10. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: "yellow_door_1 is not locked"" - At some point, yellow_door_1 should be unlocked.

11. "If expression "yellow_door_1 is not locked" holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: "At least one of the following conditions is true: "you are holding green_box_1", "you are in front of purple_door_1""" - Before yellow_door_1 is unlocked, we must either be holding green_box_1 or be in front of purple_door_1.

12. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: "red_door_1 is not locked"" - At some point, red_door_1 should be unlocked.

Now, let's devise a plan:

First, let's understand the layout:
```
Room 1 (NW) --- yellow_door_1 --- Room 3 (NE)
     |                                |
purple_door_1                  purple_door_2
     |                                |
Room 2 (SW) --- red_door_1 ---- Room 4 (SE)
```

We start in Room 4, and our goal is to be in front of yellow_door_1 when it's unlocked.

1. Since all doors are initially locked, we need to unlock the doors to navigate between rooms.
2. To unlock a door, we need to go in front of it and toggle it.

To make sense of the constraints, let's think about the constraints for unlocking each door:

1. yellow_door_1: Before unlocking it, we must either be holding green_box_1 or be in front of purple_door_1.
2. purple_door_2: Before unlocking it, we must either be in room_3 or be holding an object.
3. There's no explicit constraint for unlocking purple_door_1 or red_door_1, but we need to unlock them to navigate.

Given the initial state, where we're in Room 4, our options are to go in front of either red_door_1 or purple_door_2 (both are in Room 4). Since the constraint says we need to be in front of purple_door_1 after being in Room 4, we might need to unlock red_door_1 to reach Room 2, then unlock purple_door_1 to reach Room 1.

However, there's a constraint that before we can go in front of purple_door_2, we must either have yellow_box_1 in room_2 or be holding green_box_1. These are initially in Room 1, so we need to start by navigating to Room 1, picking up one of these, and then manipulating the board to meet all constraints.

Let's try to construct a plan:

1. We start in Room 4. We need to go to Room 2, then to Room 1.
2. To go from Room 4 to Room 2, we need to unlock red_door_1.
3. To go from Room 2 to Room 1, we need to unlock purple_door_1.
4. In Room 1, we can pick up green_box_1.
5. With green_box_1, we can return to Room 4 (via Room 2).
6. Now, before going in front of purple_door_2, we're holding green_box_1, which satisfies the constraint.
7. We can go in front of purple_door_2 and unlock it.
8. We can go to Room 3 via purple_door_2.
9. We can go in front of yellow_door_1 from Room 3.
10. At this point, we've been in front of purple_door_1 and we're holding green_box_1, which satisfies the constraint to unlock yellow_door_1.
11. We can toggle yellow_door_1 to unlock it, which satisfies our goal.

Let's trace through this plan step by step:

1. "gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2": Go in front of red_door_1 in Room 4.
2. "toggle red_door_1": Unlock red_door_1.
3. "gotoroom room_4 room_2 red_door_1": Go to Room 2 via red_door_1.
4. "gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1": Go in front of purple_door_1 in Room 2.
5. "toggle purple_door_1": Unlock purple_door_1.
6. "gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1": Go to Room 1 via purple_door_1.
7. "gotoobject green_box_1 room_1": Go in front of green_box_1 in Room 1.
8. "pick green_box_1 room_1": Pick up green_box_1.
9. "gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2": Go in front of purple_door_1 in Room 1.
10. "gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1": Go to Room 2 via purple_door_1.
11. "gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_4": Go in front of red_door_1 in Room 2.
12. "gotoroom room_2 room_4 red_door_1": Go to Room 4 via red_door_1.
13. "gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_3": Go in front of purple_door_2 in Room 4.
14. "toggle purple_door_2": Unlock purple_door_2.
15. "gotoroom room_4 room_3 purple_door_2": Go to Room 3 via purple_door_2.
16. "gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1": Go in front of yellow_door_1 in Room 3.
17. "toggle yellow_door_1": Unlock yellow_door_1.

Wait, I notice there's a constraint that states, "if purple_door_2 is not locked, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: "At least one of the following conditions is true: "you are in room_3", "you are holding some object""". Since we're toggling purple_door_2 in step 14 and we're holding green_box_1 from step 8, this constraint is satisfied.

Also, there's a constraint that states, "If expression "you are in front of purple_door_2" holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: "At least one of the following conditions is true: "yellow_box_1 is in room_2", "you are holding green_box_1""". We're going in front of purple_door_2 in step 13, and we're holding green_box_1 from step 8, so this constraint is satisfied.

Alright, the plan seems valid. However, there's one more thing to consider. The goal is to bring about the situation: "There is a door d such that "The following conditions are all true: "d is yellow", "you are in front of d", "d is not locked""". After step 17, we are in front of yellow_door_1, and yellow_door_1 is unlocked, which satisfies the goal.

Actually, I think there's a more efficient plan. We can move directly to Room 3 by unlocking purple_door_2, then go to yellow_door_1 and unlock it.

Let's replan:

1. "gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_3": Go in front of purple_door_2 in Room 4.
2. "toggle purple_door_2": Unlock purple_door_2.
3. "gotoroom room_4 room_3 purple_door_2": Go to Room 3 via purple_door_2.
4. "gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1": Go in front of yellow_door_1 in Room 3.
5. "toggle yellow_door_1": Unlock yellow_door_1.

But, there's a constraint that says, "If expression "you are in front of purple_door_2" holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: "At least one of the following conditions is true: "yellow_box_1 is in room_2", "you are holding green_box_1""". Since neither of these conditions is true initially, we can't go directly to purple_door_2.

Also, there's a constraint that says, "If expression "yellow_door_1 is not locked" holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: "At least one of the following conditions is true: "you are holding green_box_1", "you are in front of purple_door_1""". Since we're not going to Room 1 to pick up green_box_1 or to Room 2 to be in front of purple_door_1, we can't unlock yellow_door_1 directly.

So, we need to follow the longer plan I outlined earlier.

Let's refine the plan:

1. "gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2": Go in front of red_door_1 in Room 4.
2. "toggle red_door_1": Unlock red_door_1.
3. "gotoroom room_4 room_2 red_door_1": Go to Room 2 via red_door_1.
4. "gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1": Go in front of purple_door_1 in Room 2. (This satisfies the "you are in front of purple_door_1" constraint)
5. "toggle purple_door_1": Unlock purple_door_1.
6. "gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1": Go to Room 1 via purple_door_1.
7. "gotoobject green_box_1 room_1": Go in front of green_box_1 in Room 1.
8. "pick green_box_1 room_1": Pick up green_box_1. (This satisfies the "you are holding some object" constraint after purple_door_2 is locked)
9. "gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2": Go in front of purple_door_1 in Room 1.
10. "gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1": Go to Room 2 via purple_door_1.
11. "gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_4": Go in front of red_door_1 in Room 2.
12. "gotoroom room_2 room_4 red_door_1": Go to Room 4 via red_door_1.
13. "gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_3": Go in front of purple_door_2 in Room 4. (This satisfies the constraint for being in front of purple_door_2 after either having yellow_box_1 in Room 2 or holding green_box_1, since we're holding green_box_1)
14. "toggle purple_door_2": Unlock purple_door_2. (This satisfies the constraint for unlocking purple_door_2 after either being in Room 3 or holding an object, since we're holding green_box_1)
15. "gotoroom room_4 room_3 purple_door_2": Go to Room 3 via purple_door_2.
16. "gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1": Go in front of yellow_door_1 in Room 3.
17. "toggle yellow_door_1": Unlock yellow_door_1. (This satisfies the constraint for unlocking yellow_door_1 after either holding green_box_1 or being in front of purple_door_1, since we're holding green_box_1)

This plan satisfies all the constraints and reaches the goal state. 

Actually, looking at the constraints again, I'm not sure the plan fully satisfies them:

For constraint 2: If "you are in room_4" holds, then "you are in front of purple_door_1" must hold at that state or some state after. In our plan, we go from Room 4 to Room 2, then we're in front of purple_door_1. But we also return to Room 4 before reaching the goal. During this second time in Room 4, we don't go in front of purple_door_1 again.

Actually, constraint 2 is fine. It says "at s or at some state after s". Once we've been in front of purple_door_1, we've satisfied this constraint for any future states where we are in Room 4.

Let's double-check each constraint one more time to ensure our plan satisfies them:

1. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: "you are in room_4"" - We start in Room 4, so this constraint is satisfied.

2. "If expression "you are in room_4" holds in some state s, then expression "you are in front of purple_door_1" must hold at s or at some state after s" - We're in Room 4 initially and we go in front of purple_door_1 at step 4, which is after the initial state. We also return to Room 4 at step 12 and then we go in front of purple_door_2 at step 13, but since we've already been in front of purple_door_1 at step 4, this constraint is satisfied.

3. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: "you are in front of purple_door_2"" - We go in front of purple_door_2 at step 13, so this constraint is satisfied.

4. "If expression "you are in front of purple_door_2" holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: "At least one of the following conditions is true: "yellow_box_1 is in room_2", "you are holding green_box_1""" - We're in front of purple_door_2 at step 13 and we're holding green_box_1 from step 8, which is an earlier state. So, this constraint is satisfied.

5. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: "purple_door_2 is locked"" - purple_door_2 is locked in the initial state, so this constraint is satisfied.

6. "If expression "purple_door_2 is locked" holds in some state s, then expression "you are holding some object" must hold at s or at some state after s" - purple_door_2 is locked in the initial state and we're holding green_box_1 from step 8, which is after the initial state. So, this constraint is satisfied.

7. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: "purple_door_2 is not locked"" - We unlock purple_door_2 at step 14, so this constraint is satisfied.

8. "If expression "purple_door_2 is not locked" holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: "At least one of the following conditions is true: "you are in room_3", "you are holding some object""" - purple_door_2 is not locked after step 14 and we're holding green_box_1 from step 8, which is an earlier state. So, this constraint is satisfied.

9. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: "you are in front of purple_door_1"" - We go in front of purple_door_1 at step 4, so this constraint is satisfied.

10. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: "yellow_door_1 is not locked"" - We unlock yellow_door_1 at step 17, so this constraint is satisfied.

11. "If expression "yellow_door_1 is not locked" holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: "At least one of the following conditions is true: "you are holding green_box_1", "you are in front of purple_door_1""" - yellow_door_1 is not locked after step 17 and we're holding green_box_1 from step 8, which is an earlier state. And we've been in front of purple_door_1 at step 4, which is also an earlier state. So, this constraint is satisfied.

12. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: "red_door_1 is not locked"" - We unlock red_door_1 at step 2, so this constraint is satisfied.

Our plan satisfies all the constraints and reaches the goal state.

Actually, let's check if we can simplify the plan a bit. Current plan involves:
1. Going to Room 2 (through red_door_1)
2. Going to Room 1 (through purple_door_1)
3. Picking up green_box_1
4. Going back to Room 2
5. Going back to Room 4
6. Going to Room 3 (through purple_door_2)
7. Toggling yellow_door_1

If we only need to be in front of yellow_door_1 when it's unlocked, and yellow_door_1 connects Room 1 and Room 3, then we can approach it from Room 1 rather than Room 3. This could potentially simplify the plan.

Actually, the "door d" in the goal state is yellow_door_1, the only yellow door in the problem. And yellow_door_1 connects Room 1 and Room 3. So, we need to be in front of yellow_door_1 from either Room 1 or Room 3, and yellow_door_1 should be unlocked.

Let's try to optimize the plan:

1. "gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2": Go in front of red_door_1 in Room 4.
2. "toggle red_door_1": Unlock red_door_1.
3. "gotoroom room_4 room_2 red_door_1": Go to Room 2 via red_door_1.
4. "gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1": Go in front of purple_door_1 in Room 2. (This satisfies the "you are in front of purple_door_1" constraint)
5. "toggle purple_door_1": Unlock purple_door_1.
6. "gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1": Go to Room 1 via purple_door_1.
7. "gotoobject green_box_1 room_1": Go in front of green_box_1 in Room 1.
8. "pick green_box_1 room_1": Pick up green_box_1. (This satisfies the "you are holding some object" constraint after purple_door_2 is locked)
9. "gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3": Go in front of yellow_door_1 in Room 1. (Note: We're approaching yellow_door_1 from Room 1, not Room 3)
10. "toggle yellow_door_1": Unlock yellow_door_1. (This satisfies the constraint for unlocking yellow_door_1 after either holding green_box_1 or being in front of purple_door_1, since we're holding green_box_1)

Wait, this shorter plan still has a issue. It doesn't satisfy constraint 3: "The following expression must hold in at least one state: "you are in front of purple_door_2"". 

However, we know that this constraint has a precondition: "If expression "you are in front of purple_door_2" holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: "At least one of the following conditions is true: "yellow_box_1 is in room_2", "you are holding green_box_1""".

Since we've picked up green_box_1 at step 8, this precondition would be satisfied if we go in front of purple_door_2. We could potentially go to Room 3 via yellow_door_1 after unlocking it, then go to Room 4 via purple_door_2 (after unlocking it, of course). This way, we can be in front of purple_door_2 at some point, satisfying the constraint.

Let's adjust our plan:
1. "gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2": Go in front of red_door_1 in Room 4.
2. "toggle red_door_1": Unlock red_door_1.
3. "gotoroom room_4 room_2 red_door_1": Go to Room 2 via red_door_1.
4. "gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1": Go in front of purple_door_1 in Room 2. (This satisfies the "you are in front of purple_door_1" constraint)
5. "toggle purple_door_1": Unlock purple_door_1.
6. "gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1": Go to Room 1 via purple_door_1.
7. "gotoobject green_box_1 room_1": Go in front of green_box_1 in Room 1.
8. "pick green_box_1 room_1": Pick up green_box_1. (This satisfies the "you are holding some object" constraint after purple_door_2 is locked)
9. "gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3": Go in front of yellow_door_1 in Room 1.
10. "toggle yellow_door_1": Unlock yellow_door_1. (This satisfies the goal state)
11. "gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1": Go to Room 3 via yellow_door_1.
12. "gotodoor purple_door_2 room_3 room_4": Go in front of purple_door_2 in Room 3. (This satisfies the "you are in front of purple_door_2" constraint)
13. "toggle purple_door_2": Unlock purple_door_2. (This satisfies the constraint for unlocking purple_door_2 after either being in Room 3 or holding an object, since we're in Room 3)
14. "gotoroom room_3 room_4 purple_door_2": Go to Room 4 via purple_door_2.

However, after unlocking yellow_door_1 at step 10, we've already reached the goal state. The rest of the steps are to satisfy the other constraints.

Actually, given the constraints:
1. We need to have been in front of purple_door_2 at some point.
2. We need to have purple_door_2 locked and then unlocked at some point.
3. We need to have been in front of purple_door_1 at some point.
4. We need to have been in room_4 at some point (we start here, so this is satisfied).

Given these constraints, our original plan is still necessary. We need to go to Room 3 (either directly from Room 4 or indirectly through Room 1) to be in front of yellow_door_1 and unlock it. But before that, we need to satisfy the other constraints.

Let's revert to our original plan and make sure it satisfies all constraints:

1. "gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2": Go in front of red_door_1 in Room 4.
2. "toggle red_door_1": Unlock red_door_1.
3. "gotoroom room_4 room_2 red_door_1": Go to Room 2 via red_door_1.
4. "gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1": Go in front of purple_door_1 in Room 2. (This satisfies the "you are in front of purple_door_1" constraint)
5. "toggle purple_door_1": Unlock purple_door_1.
6. "gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1": Go to Room 1 via purple_door_1.
7. "gotoobject green_box_1 room_1": Go in front of green_box_1 in Room 1.
8. "pick green_box_1 room_1": Pick up green_box_1. (This satisfies the "you are holding some object" constraint after purple_door_2 is locked)
9. "gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3": Go in front of yellow_door_1 in Room 1.
10. "toggle yellow_door_1": Unlock yellow_door_1. (This satisfies the constraint for unlocking yellow_door_1 after either holding green_box_1 or being in front of purple_door_1, since we're holding green_box_1)

With step 10, we've unlocked yellow_door_1 and we're in front of it, which is our goal state.

Let's make one final check to ensure this satisfies all constraints:

Constraints we've satisfied:
1. "you are in room_4" holds in the initial state.
2. After "you are in room_4" holds, "you are in front of purple_door_1" holds after step 4.
9. "you are in front of purple_door_1" holds after step 4.
10. "yellow_door_1 is not locked" holds after step 10.
11. Before "yellow_door_1 is not locked" holds, "you are holding green_box_1" holds from step 8.
12. "red_door_1 is not locked" holds after step 2.

Constraints we haven't satisfied:
3. "you are in front of purple_door_2" needs to hold at some point.
5. "purple_door_2 is locked" holds in the initial state.
6. After "purple_door_2 is locked" holds, "you are holding some object" holds after step 8.
7. "purple_door_2 is not locked" needs to hold at some point.
8. Before "purple_door_2 is not locked" holds, either "you are in room_3" or "you are holding some object" needs to hold.

To satisfy these constraints, we need to go in front of purple_door_2 at some point and unlock it. We can do this after step 10. I'm not sure if it's necessary for the goal state, but it's necessary to satisfy the constraints.

Let's update the plan:

1. "gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2": Go in front of red_door_1 in Room 4.
2. "toggle red_door_1": Unlock red_door_1.
3. "gotoroom room_4 room_2 red_door_1": Go to Room 2 via red_door_1.
4. "gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1": Go in front of purple_door_1 in Room 2.
5. "toggle purple_door_1": Unlock purple_door_1.
6. "gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1": Go to Room 1 via purple_door_1.
7. "gotoobject green_box_1 room_1": Go in front of green_box_1 in Room 1.
8. "pick green_box_1 room_1": Pick up green_box_1.
9. "gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3": Go in front of yellow_door_1 in Room 1.
10. "toggle yellow_door_1": Unlock yellow_door_1. (This achieves our goal state)

Actually, wait. If we toggled yellow_door_1 at step 10, we've achieved the goal state. The goal is to be in front of a yellow door (which is yellow_door_1) that is unlocked. After step 10, we are in front of yellow_door_1 and it's unlocked.

Absolutely, we've achieved the goal state. But we still have a few constraints we need to satisfy. Specifically:
3. "you are in front of purple_door_2" needs to hold at some point.
7. "purple_door_2 is not locked" needs to hold at some point.

To satisfy these, let's continue our plan:

11. "gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1": Go to Room 3 via yellow_door_1.
12. "gotodoor purple_door_2 room_3 room_4": Go in front of purple_door_2 in Room 3. (This satisfies the "you are in front of purple_door_2" constraint)
13. "toggle purple_door_2": Unlock purple_door_2. (This satisfies the "purple_door_2 is not locked" constraint and the subsequent constraint since we're holding green_box_1)

Alright, our finalized plan is:

1. "gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2": Go in front of red_door_1 in Room 4.
2. "toggle red_door_1": Unlock red_door_1.
3. "gotoroom room_4 room_2 red_door_1": Go to Room 2 via red_door_1.
4. "gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1": Go in front of purple_door_1 in Room 2.
5. "toggle purple_door_1": Unlock purple_door_1.
6. "gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1": Go to Room 1 via purple_door_1.
7. "gotoobject green_box_1 room_1": Go in front of green_box_1 in Room 1.
8. "pick green_box_1 room_1": Pick up green_box_1.
9. "gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3": Go in front of yellow_door_1 in Room 1.
10. "toggle yellow_door_1": Unlock yellow_door_1. (This achieves our goal state)
11. "gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1": Go to Room 3 via yellow_door_1.
12. "gotodoor purple_door_2 room_3 room_4": Go in front of purple_door_2 in Room 3.
13. "toggle purple_door_2": Unlock purple_door_2.

This plan satisfies all constraints and reaches the goal state. Since the goal is achieved at step 10, the subsequent steps are just to satisfy the other constraints, especially the ones related to purple_door_2.

Actually, I almost missed a crucial detail: the prompt explicitly tells us that the plan should be optimal, i.e., a valid plan whose length is equal or less than the length of any other valid plan.

I don't think our current plan is optimal, but it's a valid plan.

Actually, the more I think about it, the more it seems like the goal state of the problem tells us that we need to end up in front of yellow_door_1. So, the plan should end at step 10, because that's when we've fulfilled the goal. The constraints are conditions that must be satisfied during the course of the plan, not necessarily after achieving the goal.

So, the optimal valid plan, which satisfies all constraints and ends in the goal state is:

1. "gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2": Go in front of red_door_1 in Room 4.
2. "toggle red_door_1": Unlock red_door_1.
3. "gotoroom room_4 room_2 red_door_1": Go to Room 2 via red_door_1.
4. "gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1": Go in front of purple_door_1 in Room 2.
5. "toggle purple_door_1": Unlock purple_door_1.
6. "gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1": Go to Room 1 via purple_door_1.
7. "gotoobject green_box_1 room_1": Go in front of green_box_1 in Room 1.
8. "pick green_box_1 room_1": Pick up green_box_1.
9. "gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3": Go in front of yellow_door_1 in Room 1.
10. "toggle yellow_door_1": Unlock yellow_door_1.

However, this plan doesn't satisfy the constraint that "you are in front of purple_door_2" must hold at some point. But let's double check the constraints to be sure.

I think I misunderstood some of the constraints. Some of them apply to the entire plan (i.e., they need to be true at some point during the plan), while others are conditional (i.e., if A is true at some point, then B must have been true at some point before).

Constraints that need to be true at some point during the plan:
1. "you are in room_4" - Satisfied in the initial state.
3. "you are in front of purple_door_2" - This requires us to go in front of purple_door_2 at some point.
5. "purple_door_2 is locked" - Satisfied in the initial state.
7. "purple_door_2 is not locked" - This requires us to unlock purple_door_2 at some point.
9. "you are in front of purple_door_1" - Satisfied in step 4.
10. "yellow_door_1 is not locked" - Satisfied in step 10.
12. "red_door_1 is not locked" - Satisfied in step 2.

So, we still need to go in front of purple_door_2 and unlock it to satisfy constraints 3 and 7. But we can do this before we achieve the goal state, which might lead to a shorter overall plan.

But I wonder if there's a more direct way to go from Room 4 to Room 1, where the yellow_door_1 is located. Let's draw the layout again:

```
Room 1 (NW) --- yellow_door_1 --- Room 3 (NE)
     |                                |
purple_door_1                  purple_door_2
     |                                |
Room 2 (SW) --- red_door_1 ---- Room 4 (SE)
```

We start in Room 4, and our goal is to be in front of yellow_door_1 (from either Room 1 or Room 3) when it's unlocked.

If we go from Room 4 to Room 3 via purple_door_2, then to Room 1 via yellow_door_1, we would unlock yellow_door_1 from Room 3. But wait, we can't go directly from Room 4 to Room 3 because of a constraint that says before "you are in front of purple_door_2" holds, "yellow_box_1 is in room_2" or "you are holding green_box_1" must hold. And initially, green_box_1 is in Room 1, so we need to reach Room 1 first.

It seems like our original plan is the most direct way to achieve the goal state, but we still need to satisfy all the constraints.

Let's refine the plan one more time:

1. "gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2": Go in front of red_door_1 in Room 4.
2. "toggle red_door_1": Unlock red_door_1.
3. "gotoroom room_4 room_2 red_door_1": Go to Room 2 via red_door_1.
4. "gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1": Go in front of purple_door_1 in Room 2. (This satisfies the "you are in front of purple_door_1" constraint)
5. "toggle purple_door_1": Unlock purple_door_1.
6. "gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1": Go to Room 1 via purple_door_1.
7. "gotoobject green_box_1 room_1": Go in front of green_box_1 in Room 1.
8. "pick green_box_1 room_1": Pick up green_box_1. (This satisfies the constraint for being in front of purple_door_2 after having green_box_1 in hand)
9. "gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3": Go in front of yellow_door_1 in Room 1.
10. "toggle yellow_door_1": Unlock yellow_door_1. (This satisfies the constraint for unlocking yellow_door_1 after either holding green_box_1 or being in front of purple_door_1, since we're holding green_box_1)
11. "gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1": Go to Room 3 via yellow_door_1.
12. "gotodoor purple_door_2 room_3 room_4": Go in front of purple_door_2 in Room 3. (This satisfies the "you are in front of purple_door_2" constraint)
13. "toggle purple_door_2": Unlock purple_door_2. (This satisfies the constraint for unlocking purple_door_2 after either being in Room 3 or holding an object, since we're in Room 3 and holding green_box_1)

Hmm, wait, I'm still confused about the goal state. The goal says, "There is a door d such that "The following conditions are all true: "d is yellow", "you are in front of d", "d is not locked""". After step 10, we are in front of yellow_door_1, and yellow_door_1 is unlocked. So, the goal state is achieved. The subsequent steps (11, 12, 13) are just to satisfy the other constraints.

Ah, but constraint 12 says, "The following expression must hold in at least one state: "red_door_1 is not locked"". It's one of the constraints that need to be true at some point during the plan. And we unlock red_door_1 at step 2, so this constraint is satisfied.

So, the optimal valid plan that satisfies all constraints and achieves the goal state would include steps 1-10 above, plus steps to satisfy constraints 3 and 7 about being in front of purple_door_2 and having it unlocked.

Alright, I think I've been overthinking this. Let's go back to the constraints and make sure we're satisfying them:

Constraints that need to be true at some point during the plan:
1. "you are in room_4" - Satisfied in the initial state.
3. "you are in front of purple_door_2" - We need to go in front of purple_door_2 at some point.
5. "purple_door_2 is locked" - Satisfied in the initial state.
7. "purple_door_2 is not locked" - We need to unlock purple_door_2 at some point.
9. "you are in front of purple_door_1" - Satisfied when we go in front of purple_door_1.
10. "yellow_door_1 is not locked" - Satisfied when we unlock yellow_door_1.
12. "red_door_1 is not locked" - Satisfied when we unlock red_door_1.

Conditional constraints:
2. If "you are in room_4" holds at some state s, then "you are in front of purple_door_1" must hold at s or at some state after s.
4. If "you are in front of purple_door_2" holds at some state, then there must be an earlier state in which "yellow_box_1 is in room_2" or "you are holding green_box_1" is true.
6. If "purple_door_2 is locked" holds at some state s, then "you are holding some object" must hold at s or at some state after s.
8. If "purple_door_2 is not locked" holds at some state, then there must be an earlier state in which "you are in room_3" or "you are holding some object" is true.
11. If "yellow_door_1 is not locked" holds at some state, then there must be an earlier state in which "you are holding green_box_1" or "you are in front of purple_door_1" is true.

So, I think a valid plan would be:

1. "gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2": Go in front of red_door_1 in Room 4.
2. "toggle red_door_1": Unlock red_door_1. (This satisfies constraint 12)
3. "gotoroom room_4 room_2 red_door_1": Go to Room 2 via red_door_1.
4. "gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1": Go in front of purple_door_1 in Room 2. (This satisfies constraint 9 and helps with constraint 2)
5. "toggle purple_door_1": Unlock purple_door_1.
6. "gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1": Go to Room 1 via purple_door_1.
7. "gotoobject green_box_1 room_1": Go in front of green_box_1 in Room 1.
8. "pick green_box_1 room_1": Pick up green_box_1. (This satisfies the condition for constraint 4 and also helps with constraint 6)
9. "gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3": Go in front of yellow_door_1 in Room 1.
10. "toggle yellow_door_1": Unlock yellow_door_1. (This satisfies constraint 10 and also the goal state, and the condition for constraint 11 is satisfied by the fact that we're holding green_box_1)
11. "gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1": Go to Room 3 via yellow_door_1.
12. "gotodoor purple_door_2 room_3 room_4": Go in front of purple_door_2 in Room 3. (This satisfies constraint 3, and the condition for constraint 4 is satisfied by the fact that we're holding green_box_1)
13. "toggle purple_door_2": Unlock purple_door_2. (This satisfies constraint 7, and the conditions for constraint 8 are satisfied by the fact that we're in Room 3 and holding green_box_1)

This plan:
1. Achieves the goal state (after step 10).
2. Satisfies all constraints (after step 13).

It's a valid, though not shortest, plan. But I don't think we can shorten it any further while still ensuring that all constraints are satisfied.

Actually, let me step back and think. The constraint to be "in front of purple_door_2" refers to the agent's position within a room, not the action of going through the door. Same for "in front of purple_door_1". So I need to ensure that there's a state where the agent is in front of purple_door_2 and a state where the agent is in front of purple_door_1.

1. "gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2": Go in front of red_door_1 in Room 4.
2. "toggle red_door_1": Unlock red_door_1.
3. "gotoroom room_4 room_2 red_door_1": Go to Room 2 via red_door_1.
4. "gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1": Go in front of purple_door_1 in Room 2. (Satisfies constraint 9)
5. "toggle purple_door_1": Unlock purple_door_1.
6. "gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1": Go to Room 1 via purple_door_1.
7. "gotoobject green_box_1 room_1": Go in front of green_box_1 in Room 1.
8. "pick green_box_1 room_1": Pick up green_box_1.
9. "gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3": Go in front of yellow_door_1 in Room 1.
10. "toggle yellow_door_1": Unlock yellow_door_1. (Achieves the goal state)
11. "gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1": Go to Room 3 via yellow_door_1.
12. "gotodoor purple_door_2 room_3 room_4": Go in front of purple_door_2 in Room 3. (Satisfies constraint 3)
13. "toggle purple_door_2": Unlock purple_door_2. (Satisfies constraint 7)

Yeah, I think this is the correct, valid plan.

Actually, one final optimality check: is there a way to avoid going to Room 3 after achieving the goal state? I think the answer is yes. On step 9, instead of going to yellow_door_1 from Room 1, we could go to Room 4, then to Room 3, then to yellow_door_1 from Room 3. This would require unlocking purple_door_2 first, but it would allow us to be in front of purple_door_2 before achieving the goal state. This could potentially be a shorter plan.

Let's examine this:

1. "gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2": Go in front of red_door_1 in Room 4.
2. "toggle red_door_1": Unlock red_door_1.
3. "gotoroom room_4 room_2 red_door_1": Go to Room 2 via red_door_1.
4. "gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1": Go in front of purple_door_1 in Room 2. (Satisfies constraint 9)
5. "toggle purple_door_1": Unlock purple_door_1.
6. "gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1": Go to Room 1 via purple_door_1.
7. "gotoobject green_box_1 room_1": Go in front of green_box_1 in Room 1.
8. "pick green_box_1 room_1": Pick up green_box_1.
9. "gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2": Go in front of purple_door_1 in Room 1.
10. "gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1": Go to Room 2 via purple_door_1.
11. "gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_4": Go in front of red_door_1 in Room 2.
12. "gotoroom room_2 room_4 red_door_1": Go to Room 4 via red_door_1.
13. "gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_3": Go in front of purple_door_2 in Room 4. (Satisfies constraint 3)
14. "toggle purple_door_2": Unlock purple_door_2. (Satisfies constraint 7)
15. "gotoroom room_4 room_3 purple_door_2": Go to Room 3 via purple_door_2.
16. "gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1": Go in front of yellow_door_1 in Room 3.
17. "toggle yellow_door_1": Unlock yellow_door_1. (Achieves the goal state)

This is actually longer, with 17 steps instead of 13.

I think the plan with 13 steps is the most optimal, valid plan that satisfies all constraints and achieves the goal state.

Actually, looking at the plan once more:

1. "gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2": Go in front of red_door_1 in Room 4.
2. "toggle red_door_1": Unlock red_door_1.
3. "gotoroom room_4 room_2 red_door_1": Go to Room 2 via red_door_1.
4. "gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1": Go in front of purple_door_1 in Room 2. (Satisfies constraint 9)
5. "toggle purple_door_1": Unlock purple_door_1.
6. "gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1": Go to Room 1 via purple_door_1.
7. "gotoobject green_box_1 room_1": Go in front of green_box_1 in Room 1.
8. "pick green_box_1 room_1": Pick up green_box_1.
9. "gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3": Go in front of yellow_door_1 in Room 1.
10. "toggle yellow_door_1": Unlock yellow_door_1. (Achieves the goal state)
11. "gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1": Go to Room 3 via yellow_door_1.
12. "gotodoor purple_door_2 room_3 room_4": Go in front of purple_door_2 in Room 3. (Satisfies constraint 3)
13. "toggle purple_door_2": Unlock purple_door_2. (Satisfies constraint 7)

If I've understood the constraints correctly, this is the optimal, valid plan that satisfies all constraints and achieves the goal state.

Actually, I'm so sorry for the confusion. I almost got confused again. Let me clarify my understanding one more time. 

So the goal state is:
"There is a door d such that "The following conditions are all true: "d is yellow", "you are in front of d", "d is not locked"""

There's only one yellow door in the problem, which is "yellow_door_1". So, the goal is to be in front of "yellow_door_1" and "yellow_door_1" should be unlocked.

After step 10 of the plan:
"toggle yellow_door_1": Unlock yellow_door_1.

We are in front of yellow_door_1 and yellow_door_1 is unlocked. So, we've reached the goal state.

Constraints 3 and 7 require that at some point we're in front of purple_door_2 and that purple_door_2 is unlocked. These are achieved in steps 12 and 13.

So, I'm confident that the plan with 13 steps is the optimal, valid plan for the problem.

```
1. "gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2": Go in front of red_door_1 in Room 4.
2. "toggle red_door_1": Unlock red_door_1.
3. "gotoroom room_4 room_2 red_door_1": Go to Room 2 via red_door_1.
4. "gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1": Go in front of purple_door_1 in Room 2.
5. "toggle purple_door_1": Unlock purple_door_1.
6. "gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1": Go to Room 1 via purple_door_1.
7. "gotoobject green_box_1 room_1": Go in front of green_box_1 in Room 1.
8. "pick green_box_1 room_1": Pick up green_box_1.
9. "gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3": Go in front of yellow_door_1 in Room 1.
10. "toggle yellow_door_1": Unlock yellow_door_1.
11. "gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1": Go to Room 3 via yellow_door_1.
12. "gotodoor purple_door_2 room_3 room_4": Go in front of purple_door_2 in Room 3.
13. "toggle purple_door_2": Unlock purple_door_2.
```
