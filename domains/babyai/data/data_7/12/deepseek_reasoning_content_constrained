Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. First, I need to understand the initial state, the goal, and all the constraints. 

The goal is to have a yellow door that's unlocked, and I need to be in front of it. The doors are purple_door_1 (connecting room_1 and room_2), yellow_door_1 (room_1 and room_3), red_door_1 (room_2 and room_4), and purple_door_2 (room_3 and room_4). The yellow door here is yellow_door_1. So the target is to have yellow_door_1 unlocked and be in front of it.

Now, looking at the initial state, all doors are locked. So I need to unlock yellow_door_1. To toggle a door, I need to be in front of it. So I need to reach yellow_door_1, which is between room_1 and room_3. But initially, I'm in room_4. So I need to navigate through the rooms, unlock doors as needed.

Constraints are numerous. Let's list them:

1. Must be in room_4 at least once. Already true initially, but maybe need to return there.
2. If in room_4 (which is the starting point), must be in front of purple_door_1 at that state or later. Purple_door_1 is between room_1 and room_2. So if I'm in room_4, how to get in front of purple_door_1? That door is in room_1 and room_2. So perhaps when I'm in room_2 or room_1, I can go to that door. But the constraint says that if I'm in room_4 at some state, then at that state or later, I must be in front of purple_door_1. Since the initial state is room_4, I need to eventually be in front of purple_door_1. So during the plan, after starting in room_4, I have to reach purple_door_1.

3. Must be in front of purple_door_2 at least once. Purple_door_2 connects room_3 and room_4. Since I'm starting in room_4, perhaps go to that door first.

4. If in front of purple_door_2, then earlier state must have yellow_box_1 in room_2 or holding green_box_1. So before reaching purple_door_2, I need to either move yellow_box_1 to room_2 or pick up green_box_1.

5. purple_door_2 must be locked in some state. Since initially it's locked, but maybe we toggle it. Wait, but the initial state is locked. So if we unlock it later, but the constraint requires that in some state it's locked. So even if we unlock it, as long as it's initially locked, that's covered. But if we lock it again, that would also count. So perhaps this is already satisfied by the initial state. However, the initial state is already a state where purple_door_2 is locked. So maybe that's already covered. But the plan might require toggling it, so we need to make sure that after any toggles, this condition is still met. Wait, the constraint is that in at least one state, purple_door_2 is locked. Since it starts locked, unless we unlock it and never lock it again, but the goal requires a yellow door (yellow_door_1) to be unlocked, which is separate. So maybe we can leave purple_door_2 locked in the initial state and not touch it, but the problem is that we might need to use it to move between rooms. Let me check the doors. To get from room_4 to other rooms: room_4 is connected to room_2 via red_door_1 and to room_3 via purple_door_2. But all doors are locked initially. So to get out of room_4, I need to unlock either red_door_1 or purple_door_2. But how? Because to toggle a door, I need to be in front of it, which requires being in a room connected by that door. So to toggle red_door_1 (connects room_2 and room_4), I need to be in room_4 or room_2. Since I'm in room_4, can I go to red_door_1? Let's see: gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2. The preconditions for gotodoor: I need to be in a room connected by the door, which I am (room_4), and that there's no object blocking the position in front of the door in the current room. Are there any objects blocking doors in room_4? The initial state says green_box_2 is in room_4. If the box is in front of a door, it would block it. But the problem doesn't mention objects blocking doors unless they are in front. So unless the initial positions of objects block doors, which isn't specified here. Wait, the preconditions for gotodoor d r1 r2 are: (i) you are in a room connected by d, and (ii) no object is blocking the position in front of d in the current room. But in the initial state, room_4 has green_box_2. If green_box_2 is in front of a door (like red_door_1 or purple_door_2), then the gotodoor action would be blocked. But the problem statement doesn't specify the positions of objects relative to doors. This is a problem. The initial state doesn't mention any objects blocking doors, so maybe by default, they are not blocking. So in room_4, green_box_2 is present, but not blocking any door. So I can go to the doors. So for room_4, to go to red_door_1 (connecting room_4 and room_2), I can perform gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2. But red_door_1 is locked. So after going to it, I can toggle it to unlock. Similarly for purple_door_2 in room_4.

So, first, I need to unlock a door to get out of room_4. Let's see. The doors in room_4 are red_door_1 (to room_2) and purple_door_2 (to room_3). Both are locked. So to unlock either, I need to go to the door and toggle it.

But to reach yellow_door_1 (the target door), which is in room_1 and room_3. So the path could be room_4 -> room_3 (via purple_door_2) or room_4 -> room_2 (via red_door_1), then to room_1 via purple_door_1, then to room_3 via yellow_door_1. Let's consider possible paths.

But let's check the constraints again. The plan must satisfy all constraints. Let's list the constraints again:

Constraints:

1. Be in room_4 in at least one state. Initial state satisfies this, but if we leave and come back, that's okay.

2. If in room_4 at state s, then be in front of purple_door_1 at s or later. Since we start in room_4, we need to eventually be in front of purple_door_1. Purple_door_1 is in room_1 and room_2. So to be in front of it, I need to be in either room_1 or room_2. So after leaving room_4, I need to reach room_1 or room_2 and go to that door.

3. Must be in front of purple_door_2 at least once. Purple_door_2 is in room_3 and room_4. Since starting in room_4, I can go to purple_door_2 first. But to do that, I need to go to the door (gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_3). But since it's locked, I need to unlock it. Wait, but the door is locked. So the steps would be:

From room_4, gotodoor purple_door_2 room4 room3 (possible if no object is blocking). Then toggle it to unlock. Then go to room3. But perhaps I need to do that. However, constraint 4 says that if I'm in front of purple_door_2, then earlier state must have yellow_box_1 in room_2 or holding green_box_1. So before going to purple_door_2, I need to satisfy that.

But the initial state has green_box_1 in room_1. So unless I pick it up, I can't have it. But how to get green_box_1? To get to room_1, I need to go through other doors. Let's see.

Alternatively, maybe I can first unlock purple_door_2 in room4, then go to room3, then proceed. But before that, I need to satisfy constraint 4. So before being in front of purple_door_2, I must have either yellow_box_1 in room_2 or be holding green_box_1. But yellow_box_1 is in room_1 initially, so to get it to room_2, I need to move it. But how? That would require picking it up, which requires being in room_1, which is not accessible yet. Alternatively, if I can pick up green_box_1 (in room_1), but to get to room_1, I need to go through room_2 or room3. Let's see possible paths.

Another approach: since the goal is to be in front of a yellow door (yellow_door_1) that's unlocked, which connects room_1 and room_3. So to unlock it, I need to be in front of it and toggle it. So the plan must reach yellow_door_1, toggle it to unlock. Then the goal is satisfied.

But how to reach yellow_door_1? Let's consider possible paths.

Option 1: From room_4, unlock purple_door_2 to room3, go to room3, then go to yellow_door_1 (which connects room3 and room1). But yellow_door_1 is locked initially. So need to unlock it.

But to unlock yellow_door_1, need to be in front of it. So from room3, go to yellow_door_1 (gotodoor yellow_door_1 room3 room1), then toggle to unlock. Then, the goal is achieved.

But let's check the steps:

1. Start in room4.

2. Gotodoor purple_door_2 room4 room3. But need to check if any objects are blocking. Since room4 has green_box_2, but unless it's in front of the door, which isn't stated. So assuming it's possible.

3. Toggle purple_door_2 to unlock. Now purple_door_2 is unlocked.

4. Gotoroom room4 room3 purple_door_2. Now in room3.

5. In room3, gotodoor yellow_door_1 room3 room1. But yellow_door_1 is locked. So need to toggle it. But to toggle, need to be in front of it. So:

6. Toggle yellow_door_1. Now it's unlocked.

7. Now, to satisfy the goal, need to be in front of a yellow door (yellow_door_1) that's unlocked. So after step 6, I'm in front of yellow_door_1, and it's unlocked. So that would satisfy the goal. Then the plan could end here.

But wait, the goal is "There is a door d such that d is yellow, you are in front of d, and d is not locked." So after step 6, the door is unlocked, and I'm in front of it. So steps 1-6 would achieve the goal. But need to check constraints.

Now, check all constraints:

Constraint 1: Be in room_4 in at least one state. Initial state is room4, so that's satisfied.

Constraint 2: If in room4 (which is true initially), then in front of purple_door_1 at that state or later. The initial state is in room4, so we need to be in front of purple_door_1 at some point. But in the current plan, we never go to purple_door_1. So this constraint is violated. Therefore, the plan is invalid.

So need to adjust. How to include being in front of purple_door_1.

So, after achieving the goal, we need to also go to purple_door_1. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps take a different path that includes going through purple_door_1.

Another approach: From room4, unlock red_door_1 (connects room4 and room2). Let's see:

1. In room4, gotodoor red_door_1 room4 room2.

2. Toggle red_door_1 to unlock.

3. Gotoroom room4 room2 red_door_1. Now in room2.

4. In room2, go to purple_door_1 (connects room2 and room1). But purple_door_1 is locked. So need to toggle it. But to do that, need to be in front of it.

5. Gotodoor purple_door_1 room2 room1.

6. Toggle purple_door_1 to unlock.

7. Now, go to room1 via purple_door_1.

But why? Because then from room1, we can go to room3 via yellow_door_1, but that's locked. Wait, the goal is to unlock yellow_door_1. So perhaps this path:

From room2, go to room1 via purple_door_1 (after unlocking it), then in room1, go to yellow_door_1 (room1-room3), unlock it, then be in front of it.

But let's outline this path:

1. Start in room4.

2. gotodoor red_door_1 room4 room2.

3. toggle red_door_1 (unlock).

4. gotoroom room4 room2 red_door_1. Now in room2.

5. gotodoor purple_door_1 room2 room1.

6. toggle purple_door_1 (unlock).

7. gotoroom room2 room1 purple_door_1. Now in room1.

8. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room1 room3.

9. toggle yellow_door_1 (unlock). Now it's unlocked.

10. Now, in front of yellow_door_1, which is yellow and unlocked. Goal achieved.

But need to check constraints.

Constraint 2: When in room4 (initially), must be in front of purple_door_1 at s or later. But in this plan, after leaving room4, we go to room2 and then to purple_door_1. So in step 5, gotodoor purple_door_1 in room2. So the state after step5 is in front of purple_door_1. So constraint2 is satisfied.

Constraint3: must be in front of purple_door_2. In this plan, we never go to purple_door_2. So constraint3 is violated. So need to adjust.

Ah, right. So the plan must include being in front of purple_door_2 at some point. So need to go there. How?

In the current plan, after step4 (in room2), perhaps after unlocking purple_door_1 and going to room1, etc., but then how to get to purple_door_2? Maybe after achieving the goal, go back to room4 via another door.

Alternatively, maybe a different path that includes both purple_door_1 and purple_door_2.

But this is getting complicated. Let's try to outline a plan that satisfies all constraints.

Constraints to satisfy:

- Must be in room4 at least once. Initial state covers that.

- Must be in front of purple_door_1 (after being in room4). So after step0 (initial), need to reach purple_door_1.

- Must be in front of purple_door_2 (room4-room3 door).

- When in front of purple_door_2, earlier state must have yellow_box_1 in room2 or holding green_box_1. So need to either move yellow_box_1 to room2 (which is in room1) or pick up green_box_1 (in room1). But how to get to room1? Need to unlock doors.

Also, purple_door_2 must be locked in some state. Initially, it's locked. So unless we unlock it and lock it again, but in the plan, perhaps we unlock it, but the initial state is already locked. So that's covered.

Another constraint: if purple_door_2 is locked in some state s, then in s or after, the agent is holding some object. So in the initial state, purple_door_2 is locked, and the agent is not holding anything. So this violates the constraint. Wait, no. The constraint says: If "purple_door_2 is locked" holds in some state s, then "you are holding some object" must hold at s or after. But initially, purple_door_2 is locked, and the agent is not holding anything. So this violates the constraint. Because the initial state has purple_door_2 locked, and the agent is not holding anything. So the initial state itself is invalid? No, because the constraints are part of the problem that the plan must satisfy. Wait, no. The constraints are part of the problem that the plan must abide by. Wait, the problem says: "A valid plan for the abovementioned problem must abide by the following constraints". So the constraints must hold in the plan's execution. So the initial state may violate the constraints unless the plan's actions correct it. Wait, no. The constraints are conditions that must hold during the execution of the plan. For example, the first constraint says "The following expression must hold in at least one state: you are in room_4". Which is true initially, so that's okay.

But the constraint: "If expression 'purple_door_2 is locked' holds in some state s, then expression 'you are holding some object' must hold at s or at some state after s." In the initial state, purple_door_2 is locked, and the agent is not holding anything. So this would violate the constraint unless in the plan, after the initial state, the agent picks up an object. Because the initial state is part of the plan's execution. So the plan must ensure that whenever purple_door_2 is locked, either in that state the agent is holding something, or in a subsequent state. But in the initial state, purple_door_2 is locked and the agent is not holding anything. So to satisfy this constraint, the agent must pick up an object at some point after the initial state. Because the initial state violates this constraint otherwise. So the plan must include picking up an object, and in any state where purple_door_2 is locked (like the initial state and possibly others), there must be a subsequent state where the agent is holding something.

Similarly, the constraint regarding when purple_door_2 is not locked requires that in an earlier state, the agent was in room3 or holding some object.

So let's think about this step by step.

Let's try to outline a plan that satisfies all constraints:

1. Start in room4.

2. Need to be in front of purple_door_2 at some point. So let's do that first.

But to go to purple_door_2, from room4: gotodoor purple_door_2 room4 room3. But since purple_door_2 is locked, but the action is just going in front of it. Toggling it will unlock it.

But according to constraint4: before being in front of purple_door_2, need to have yellow_box_1 in room2 or holding green_box_1. Since yellow_box_1 is in room1 initially, and green_box_1 is in room1, we can't get them unless we reach room1. So this seems impossible. Therefore, the only way is to hold green_box_1 before going to purple_door_2. But how? To get green_box_1, which is in room1, we need to go to room1, which requires going through room2 or room3. But to get to room2 or room3 from room4, we need to unlock doors.

So perhaps:

- From room4, unlock red_door_1 (room4-room2) or purple_door_2 (room4-room3). Let's try unlocking red_door_1 first.

Steps:

1. In room4, gotoempty (to ensure we're not in front of any object/door before moving).

Wait, but to go to a door, we need to use gotodoor. Let me think:

Initial state: in room4, not holding anything.

Action1: gotodoor red_door_1 room4 room2. Preconditions: in room4 (yes), no object blocking (assuming yes). So perform this.

Effect: in front of red_door_1.

Action2: toggle red_door_1. Now it's unlocked.

Action3: gotoroom room4 room2 red_door_1. Now in room2.

Action4: gotodoor purple_door_1 room2 room1. Preconditions: in room2 (yes), no object blocking. Toggle purple_door_1 to unlock.

Action5: toggle purple_door_1. Now unlocked.

Action6: gotoroom room2 room1 purple_door_1. Now in room1.

Action7: gotoobject green_box_1 room1. Preconditions: in room1, not holding anything. So yes.

Action8: pick green_box_1 room1. Now holding green_box_1.

Now, we have green_box_1. Now, need to go to purple_door_2 at some point. Since we're in room1, perhaps go back to room2, then to room4, then to purple_door_2.

Action9: drop green_box_1 somewhere? Or carry it. But need to satisfy constraint4 when we go to purple_door_2. Since we are holding green_box_1, that satisfies the condition.

So after picking up green_box_1, we can proceed to purple_door_2.

But how to get to purple_door_2 from room1:

room1 -> room3 via yellow_door_1 (needs unlocking) or room1 -> room2 via purple_door_1 (unlocked).

From room1, go back to room2 via purple_door_1 (already unlocked).

Action9: gotoroom room1 room2 purple_door_1. Now in room2.

From room2, go to room4 via red_door_1 (unlocked).

Action10: gotodoor red_door_1 room2 room4. Preconditions: in room2. yes.

Action11: toggle red_door_1 (already unlocked, so locking it? No, but we need to keep it unlocked to use it again. Wait, but the goal requires yellow_door_1 to be unlocked. Other doors can be locked again as long as they aren't needed.

Wait, but toggling a door changes its state. So if we unlocked red_door_1, toggling it again would lock it. So perhaps after unlocking red_door_1, we need to keep it unlocked until we're done using it.

But let's proceed.

Action10: gotoroom room2 room4 red_door_1. Now back in room4.

Now, in room4, need to go to purple_door_2.

Action11: gotodoor purple_door_2 room4 room3.

Action12: toggle purple_door_2 to unlock.

Now, being in front of purple_door_2 satisfies constraint3. And since we were holding green_box_1 earlier (action8), which is before action11-12, that satisfies constraint4.

But wait, when do we drop green_box_1? If we are still holding it when we go to purple_door_2, then constraint4 is satisfied. But if we dropped it earlier, then we need to have yellow_box_1 in room2. Let's see:

In action8, we picked green_box_1. Then in action9, we went to room2. If we drop it in room2:

Action9: drop green_box_1 room2. But to drop, need to be in front of an empty spot. So after action9 (gotoroom room1 room2), we are in room2. Then gotoempty, then drop.

But this complicates the steps. Alternatively, carry green_box_1 until we reach purple_door_2.

But let's assume we carry it:

Action9: gotoroom room1 room2 purple_door_1 (holding green_box_1).

Action10: gotoroom room2 room4 red_door_1 (still holding green_box_1).

Action11: gotodoor purple_door_2 room4 room3.

Action12: toggle purple_door_2 (unlock).

Now, in front of purple_door_2, which satisfies constraint3. And since we were holding green_box_1 in action11-12, which is before action12, the constraint4 is satisfied.

Now, proceed to unlock yellow_door_1.

Action13: gotoroom room4 room3 purple_door_2. Now in room3.

Action14: gotodoor yellow_door_1 room3 room1.

Action15: toggle yellow_door_1 (unlock).

Now, in front of yellow_door_1, which is yellow and unlocked. Goal achieved.

But also need to satisfy other constraints:

- Constraint6: If purple_door_2 is locked in some state, then in that state or later, you are holding something. In the initial state, purple_door_2 is locked, and we are not holding anything. But according to the plan, after the initial state, we picked up green_box_1 (action8), so in state after action8, we are holding something. So the initial state's condition is satisfied by the subsequent action of picking up green_box_1. Because the constraint says that if in state s (initial) purple_door_2 is locked, then in s or after, you are holding something. So after s (initial), in action8, you are holding something. So that's okay.

Another constraint: When purple_door_2 is not locked (after action12), there must be an earlier state where you were in room3 or holding something. After action12, purple_door_2 is unlocked. The earlier state where we were holding green_box_1 (action8 onwards) satisfies this.

Constraint7: must be in front of purple_door_1. In action4, we went to purple_door_1 in room2. So that's satisfied.

Constraint8: yellow_door_1 must be not locked. Achieved in action15.

Constraint9: If yellow_door_1 is not locked (action15), then earlier state must be holding green_box_1 or in front of purple_door_1. We were holding green_box_1 (actions8-12), which is earlier. So satisfied.

Constraint10: red_door_1 must be not locked. In action2, we unlocked it. But if we toggled it again (like action10: gotoroom room2 room4 red_door_1 requires it to be unlocked). So red_door_1 is unlocked at least in action2. So constraint10 is satisfied.

Now, checking all steps for constraints:

- Be in room4: initial state.

- After room4, in front of purple_door_1: action4.

- In front of purple_door_2: action11-12.

- Before purple_door_2, holding green_box_1: yes.

- purple_door_2 is locked in initial state: yes.

- When purple_door_2 is locked (initial), then in a later state (action8) holding something.

- purple_door_2 is not locked after action12: yes, and earlier states (action8) holding something.

- In front of purple_door_1: action4.

- yellow_door_1 is not locked: action15.

- When yellow_door_1 is unlocked (action15), earlier state (action8) holding green_box_1.

- red_door_1 is not locked: action2.

So all constraints are satisfied.

Now, the steps would be:

1. gotodoor red_door_1 room4 room2

2. toggle red_door_1

3. gotoroom room4 room2 red_door_1

4. gotodoor purple_door_1 room2 room1

5. toggle purple_door_1

6. gotoroom room2 room1 purple_door_1

7. gotoobject green_box_1 room1

8. pick green_box_1 room1

9. gotoroom room1 room2 purple_door_1

10. gotoroom room2 room4 red_door_1

11. gotodoor purple_door_2 room4 room3

12. toggle purple_door_2

13. gotoroom room4 room3 purple_door_2

14. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room3 room1

15. toggle yellow_door_1

This gives the goal: in front of yellow_door_1, which is unlocked and yellow.

But wait, after action15, are we still in front of yellow_door_1? Because the toggle action requires being in front of the door, and after toggling, we're still there. So the final state is being in front of yellow_door_1, which is unlocked.

But let's check each action's preconditions and effects:

Action1: gotodoor red_door_1 room4 room2. Pre: in room4, no blocking. Yes. Effect: in front of red_door_1.

Action2: toggle red_door_1. Pre: in front of it. Yes. Effect: unlocked.

Action3: gotoroom room4 room2 red_door_1. Pre: door unlocked. Yes. Now in room2.

Action4: gotodoor purple_door_1 room2 room1. Pre: in room2, no blocking. Yes. Now in front of purple_door_1.

Action5: toggle purple_door_1. Pre: in front. Yes. Now unlocked.

Action6: gotoroom room2 room1 purple_door_1. Now in room1.

Action7: gotoobject green_box_1 room1. Pre: in room1. Yes. Now in front of green_box_1.

Action8: pick green_box_1 room1. Pre: not holding anything. Yes. Now holding it.

Action9: gotoroom room1 room2 purple_door_1. Pre: door unlocked. Yes. Now in room2.

Action10: gotoroom room2 room4 red_door_1. Pre: door unlocked (red_door_1 was unlocked in action2). Yes. Now in room4.

Action11: gotodoor purple_door_2 room4 room3. Pre: in room4. Yes. Now in front of purple_door_2.

Action12: toggle purple_door_2. Pre: in front. Yes. Now unlocked.

Action13: gotoroom room4 room3 purple_door_2. Now in room3.

Action14: gotodoor yellow_door_1 room3 room1. Pre: in room3. Yes. Now in front of yellow_door_1.

Action15: toggle yellow_door_1. Pre: in front. Yes. Now unlocked.

So the final state is in front of yellow_door_1, which is unlocked and yellow. All constraints are satisfied.

But let's count the steps. Is this the optimal (shortest possible) plan? Maybe some steps can be optimized.

For example, after picking up green_box_1 in room1 (action8), instead of going back to room4 via room2, perhaps go to room3 via yellow_door_1. But yellow_door_1 is locked until action15. So that's not possible. So the current path is necessary.

Alternatively, after unlocking purple_door_2, go to room3, then to yellow_door_1. Which is what the plan does.

Yes, this seems necessary. So this plan is valid and optimal.
