Alright, I need to create a plan for a 2D gridworld based on the given problem. Let's first understand the scenario, the constraints, and the goal.

The world consists of 4 rooms: `room_1` (NW), `room_2` (SW), `room_3` (NE), `room_4` (SE). The rooms are connected by doors: `room_1` and `room_2` via `grey_door_1`, `room_1` and `room_3` via `yellow_door_1`, `room_2` and `room_4` via `green_door_1`, and `room_3` and `room_4` via `grey_door_2`.

The task is to bring about a situation where there is a green door connecting `room_4` and `room_2`, which the agent is in front of and which is unlocked. Based on the world description, that door is `green_door_1`.

Let's look at the initial state:
- I am in `room_4`.
- All doors are locked.
- The objects are distributed as follows:
  - `room_1`: `grey_box_1`
  - `room_2`: `yellow_box_1`
  - `room_3`: `blue_box_1`, `purple_box_1`, `blue_box_2`, `purple_ball_1`
  - `room_4`: `grey_ball_1`, `grey_box_2`
- I am not holding any object.

Let's look at the constraints and see if they help determine a valid plan:

1. `green_door_1` must be unlocked at some point.
2. Before `green_door_1` is unlocked, `yellow_box_1` must be in `room_4`.
3. At some point, `purple_box_1` must be in `room_1` and I must be holding some object.
4. At some point, I must either be holding `yellow_box_1` or `purple_ball_1` must be in `room_2`.
5. At some point, `green_door_1` must be locked.
6. If `green_door_1` is locked in state `s`, I must be holding some object at state `s` or at some state after `s`.
7. At some point, I must be holding `blue_box_2`.
8. At some point, I must either be in `room_2` or holding `grey_ball_1`.
9. At some point, I must be holding some object.

Given these constraints and the goal, I need to create a valid sequence of actions that achieves the goal while satisfying the constraints.

First, I need to think about the overall sequence to reach the goal:

1. I need to get `yellow_box_1` from `room_2` to `room_4`.
2. I need to unlock `green_door_1` (which connects `room_4` and `room_2`).
3. I need to position myself in front of `green_door_1` from `room_4`.

However, before I can do this, I need to navigate through rooms, pick up and move objects to satisfy the constraints. Let's try to put these into a coherent plan.

Initially, I'm in `room_4` and all doors are locked. I need to:
1. Go to a door (like `grey_door_2` since I'm in `room_4`).
2. Toggle the door to unlock it.
3. Go to `room_3` via `grey_door_2`.
4. Pick `blue_box_2` (satisfying constraint 7).
5. Move `purple_box_1` to `room_1` (part of constraint 3) - This needs more steps.
6. Get `yellow_box_1` from `room_2` to `room_4` (constraint 2).
7. Position myself in front of `green_door_1` and unlock it.

But there's a problem. Initially, all doors are locked, so I can't immediately move between rooms. I need to unlock doors as I go.

Let's plan this step by step:

1. I'm in `room_4`. I go to `grey_door_2`.
2. I unlock `grey_door_2`.
3. I go to `room_3` via `grey_door_2`.
4. I pick `blue_box_2` (satisfying constraint 7).
5. I go to `yellow_door_1`.
6. I unlock `yellow_door_1`.
7. I go to `room_1` via `yellow_door_1`.
8. I drop `blue_box_2` (this frees my hands).
9. I go to `grey_door_1`.
10. I unlock `grey_door_1`.
11. I go to `room_2` via `grey_door_1` (satisfying constraint 8).
12. I pick `yellow_box_1` (satisfying constraint 4 by holding `yellow_box_1`).
13. I go to `grey_door_1`.
14. I go to `room_1` via `grey_door_1`.
15. I go to `yellow_door_1`.
16. I go to `room_3` via `yellow_door_1`.
17. I go to `purple_box_1` (I'm now holding `yellow_box_1` and want to go to `purple_box_1`).
18. I drop `yellow_box_1` (freeing my hands).
19. I pick `purple_box_1`.
20. I go to `yellow_door_1`.
21. I go to `room_1` via `yellow_door_1`. (This satisfies constraint 3, as `purple_box_1` is in `room_1` and I'm holding it).
22. I drop `purple_box_1`.
23. I pick `blue_box_2` (since I dropped it in `room_1` earlier).
24. I go to `grey_door_1`.
25. I go to `room_2` via `grey_door_1`.
26. I drop `blue_box_2` (freeing my hands).
27. I pick `purple_ball_1` (to fulfill the alternate condition of constraint 4, having `purple_ball_1` in `room_2`).
28. I drop `purple_ball_1` (leaving it in `room_2`).
29. I pick `blue_box_2`.
30. I go to `green_door_1`.
31. I unlock `green_door_1` (now it's locked to satisfy constraint 5).
32. I go to `room_4` via `green_door_1`.
33. I drop `blue_box_2` (freeing my hands).
34. I pick `yellow_box_1` from the previous step.
35. I go to `green_door_1`.
36. I toggle `green_door_1` (unlocking it, which satisfies constraint 1 and also the condition of having `yellow_box_1` in `room_4` before `green_door_1` is unlocked, which satisfies constraint 2).

Wait, there's an issue. In the sequence of steps I outlined, I didn't bring `yellow_box_1` to `room_4` before unlocking `green_door_1`. Also, there's no way to pick `purple_ball_1` in `room_2` when it starts in `room_3`.

Let me rethink the plan...

1. I'm in `room_4`. I go to `grey_door_2`.
2. I toggle `grey_door_2` (unlocking it).
3. I go to `room_3` via `grey_door_2`.
4. I pick `blue_box_2` (satisfying constraint 7).
5. I go to `grey_door_2`.
6. I go to `room_4` via `grey_door_2`.
7. I go to `grey_ball_1`.
8. I drop `blue_box_2` (freeing my hands).
9. I pick `grey_ball_1` (satisfying constraint 8).
10. I go to `grey_door_2`.
11. I go to `room_3` via `grey_door_2`.
12. I go to `purple_ball_1`.
13. I drop `grey_ball_1` (freeing my hands).
14. I pick `purple_ball_1`.
15. I go to `yellow_door_1`.
16. I toggle `yellow_door_1` (unlocking it).
17. I go to `room_1` via `yellow_door_1`.
18. I go to `grey_door_1`.
19. I toggle `grey_door_1` (unlocking it).
20. I go to `room_2` via `grey_door_1`.
21. I drop `purple_ball_1` (leaving it in `room_2`, satisfying constraint 4).
22. I go to `yellow_box_1`.
23. I pick `yellow_box_1` (this also satisfies constraint 4 by holding `yellow_box_1`).
24. I go to `green_door_1`.
25. I toggle `green_door_1` (unlocking it, despite not having `yellow_box_1` in `room_4`).

Oh wait, there's another issue. Constraint 2 says that before `green_door_1` is unlocked, `yellow_box_1` must be in `room_4`. So, I can't unlock `green_door_1` as I'm holding `yellow_box_1`.

Let me rethink the plan again...

Let's see what we need:
1. At some point, `green_door_1` must be unlocked.
2. Before `green_door_1` is unlocked, `yellow_box_1` must be in `room_4`.
3. At some point, `purple_box_1` must be in `room_1` when I'm holding some object.
4. At some point, I must either hold `yellow_box_1` or `purple_ball_1` must be in `room_2`.
5. At some point, `green_door_1` must be locked.
6. If `green_door_1` is locked, I must be holding some object at that state or later.
7. At some point, I must hold `blue_box_2`.
8. At some point, I must either be in `room_2` or holding `grey_ball_1`.
9. At some point, I must be holding some object.

Initially, I'm in `room_4` and all doors are locked. I need to navigate through doors to get objects, ensuring those doors are unlocked first.

Let's try a new approach:

1. I'm in `room_4`. I go to `grey_door_2`.
2. I toggle `grey_door_2` (unlocking it).
3. I go to `room_3` via `grey_door_2` (satisfying part of constraint 6, as I'm now holding an object after the state where `green_door_1` is locked).
4. I pick `blue_box_2` (satisfying constraint 7).
5. I go to `yellow_door_1`.
6. I toggle `yellow_door_1` (unlocking it).
7. I go to `room_1` via `yellow_door_1`.
8. I go to `grey_door_1`.
9. I toggle `grey_door_1` (unlocking it).
10. I go to `room_2` via `grey_door_1` (satisfying constraint 8).
11. I go to `yellow_box_1`.
12. I drop `blue_box_2` (freeing my hands).
13. I pick `yellow_box_1` (satisfying constraint 4).
14. I go to `green_door_1`.
15. I go to `room_4` via `green_door_1`.
16. I drop `yellow_box_1` (satisfying constraint 2, since `yellow_box_1` is now in `room_4`).
17. I go to `green_door_1`.
18. I toggle `green_door_1` (unlocking it, which satisfies constraint 1).
19. I go to `room_2` via `green_door_1`.
20. I go to `blue_box_2`.
21. I pick `blue_box_2`.
22. I go to `grey_door_1`.
23. I go to `room_1` via `grey_door_1` (this part of the plan doesn't incorporate constraint 3 yet).

I'm not fitting in all the constraints yet. Let me think more about this.

I think I missed a detail. The constraint says: "If `green_door_1` is locked in state `s`, I must be holding some object at state `s` or at some state after `s`." Initially, all doors are locked, so `green_door_1` is locked in the initial state. This means I must be holding some object in the initial state or a subsequent state. Since in the initial state I'm not holding any object, I must pick an object at some point, which satisfies this constraint.

Let's rethink the plan:

1. I'm in `room_4`. I go to `grey_door_2`.
2. I toggle `grey_door_2` (unlocking it).
3. I go to `room_3` via `grey_door_2`.
4. I pick `purple_box_1`.
5. I go to `yellow_door_1`.
6. I toggle `yellow_door_1` (unlocking it).
7. I go to `room_1` via `yellow_door_1` (satisfying constraint 3, since `purple_box_1` is in `room_1` and I'm holding it).
8. I drop `purple_box_1` (leaving it in `room_1`, which continues to satisfy constraint 3).
9. I go to `grey_door_1`.
10. I toggle `grey_door_1` (unlocking it).
11. I go to `room_2` via `grey_door_1` (satisfying constraint 8).
12. I go to `yellow_box_1`.
13. I pick `yellow_box_1` (satisfying constraint 4).
14. I go to `green_door_1`.
15. I go to `room_4` via `green_door_1` (Initially `green_door_1` is locked, but after toggling `grey_door_2`, `yellow_door_1`, and `grey_door_1`, I've implicitly toggled `green_door_1` too).
16. Wait, that can't be right. All doors start locked and toggling one door doesn't toggle others. I need to toggle `green_door_1` too. But there's a constraint that before `green_door_1` is unlocked, `yellow_box_1` must be in `room_4`.

I think I need a more systematic approach:

1. I'm in `room_4`. I go to `grey_door_2`.
2. I toggle `grey_door_2` (unlocking it).
3. I go to `room_3` via `grey_door_2`.
4. I pick `blue_box_2` (satisfying constraint 7).
5. I go to `purple_box_1`.
6. I drop `blue_box_2` (freeing my hands).
7. I pick `purple_box_1`.
8. I go to `yellow_door_1`.
9. I toggle `yellow_door_1` (unlocking it).
10. I go to `room_1` via `yellow_door_1` (satisfying constraint 3, since `purple_box_1` is in `room_1` and I'm holding it).
11. I drop `purple_box_1` (leaving it in `room_1`).
12. I go to `grey_door_1`.
13. I toggle `grey_door_1` (unlocking it).
14. I go to `room_2` via `grey_door_1` (satisfying constraint 8).
15. I go to `purple_ball_1` (but wait, `purple_ball_1` is in `room_3`, not `room_2`).

I see I made a mistake again. Let me restart the plan with a clearer picture.

Objects and locations:
- `room_1`: `grey_box_1`
- `room_2`: `yellow_box_1`
- `room_3`: `blue_box_1`, `purple_box_1`, `blue_box_2`, `purple_ball_1`
- `room_4`: `grey_ball_1`, `grey_box_2`

Doors:
- `grey_door_1` connects `room_1` and `room_2`
- `yellow_door_1` connects `room_1` and `room_3`
- `green_door_1` connects `room_2` and `room_4`
- `grey_door_2` connects `room_3` and `room_4`

Let's plan:

1. I'm in `room_4`. I go to `grey_door_2`.
2. I toggle `grey_door_2` (unlocking it).
3. I go to `room_3` via `grey_door_2`.
4. I pick `blue_box_2` (satisfying constraint 7).
5. I go to `yellow_door_1`.
6. I toggle `yellow_door_1` (unlocking it).
7. I go to `room_1` via `yellow_door_1`.
8. I go to `grey_door_1`.
9. I toggle `grey_door_1` (unlocking it).
10. I go to `room_2` via `grey_door_1` (satisfying constraint 8).
11. I go to `yellow_box_1`.
12. I drop `blue_box_2` (freeing my hands).
13. I pick `yellow_box_1` (satisfying constraint 4).
14. I go to `green_door_1`.
15. I go to `room_4` via `green_door_1` (but I can't do this yet since `green_door_1` is still locked).

I forgot I need to toggle `green_door_1` to unlock it, but before I can do that, I need to have `yellow_box_1` in `room_4`.

Wait, let me reconsider the constraints. Constraint 2 says, "If expression `green_door_1 is not locked` holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: `yellow_box_1 is in room_4`."

This means before I toggle `green_door_1` to unlock it, I need to have `yellow_box_1` in `room_4`.

Given the initial setup, I can't go directly from `room_2` to `room_4` via `green_door_1` since it's locked. So, I need to take a longer route to get `yellow_box_1` to `room_4`.

Let's revise the plan...

Actually, I think the constraint is misleading me. It doesn't say I can't toggle `green_door_1` unless `yellow_box_1` is in `room_4`. It only says that before the state where `green_door_1` is not locked, there must be a state where `yellow_box_1` is in `room_4`. Let's think of it this way: I can bring `yellow_box_1` to `room_4`, then take it back to `room_2`, and then unlock `green_door_1`.

Let's try again, and be systematic:

1. I'm in `room_4`. I go to `grey_door_2`.
2. I toggle `grey_door_2` (unlocking it).
3. I go to `room_3` via `grey_door_2`.
4. I pick `purple_ball_1`.
5. I go to `yellow_door_1`.
6. I toggle `yellow_door_1` (unlocking it).
7. I go to `room_1` via `yellow_door_1`.
8. I go to `grey_door_1`.
9. I toggle `grey_door_1` (unlocking it).
10. I go to `room_2` via `grey_door_1` (satisfying constraint 8).
11. I drop `purple_ball_1` (leaving it in `room_2`, satisfying constraint 4).
12. I go to `yellow_box_1`.
13. I pick `yellow_box_1`.
14. I go to `grey_door_1`.
15. I go to `room_1` via `grey_door_1`.
16. I go to `yellow_door_1`.
17. I go to `room_3` via `yellow_door_1`.
18. I go to `blue_box_2`.
19. I drop `yellow_box_1` (freeing my hands).
20. I pick `blue_box_2` (satisfying constraint 7).
21. I go to `purple_box_1`.
22. I drop `blue_box_2` (freeing my hands).
23. I pick `purple_box_1`.
24. I go to `yellow_door_1`.
25. I go to `room_1` via `yellow_door_1` (satisfying constraint 3, since `purple_box_1` is in `room_1` and I'm holding it).
26. I drop `purple_box_1`.
27. I go to `yellow_door_1`.
28. I go to `room_3` via `yellow_door_1`.
29. I go to `yellow_box_1`.
30. I pick `yellow_box_1`.
31. I go to `grey_door_2`.
32. I go to `room_4` via `grey_door_2`.
33. I drop `yellow_box_1` (satisfying constraint 2, since `yellow_box_1` is now in `room_4`).
34. I go to `green_door_1`.
35. I toggle `green_door_1` (unlocking it, which satisfies constraint 1, and it's consistent with constraint 2 since `yellow_box_1` is in `room_4`).
36. I go to `yellow_box_1`.
37. I pick `yellow_box_1`.
38. I go to `green_door_1` (satisfying the goal, as I'm in front of `green_door_1` and it's unlocked).
39. Toggle `green_door_1` (to satisfy constraint 5).
40. Drop `yellow_box_1`.
41. Gotoempty (to not be in front of `yellow_box_1`).
42. Pick `yellow_box_1` (to satisfy constraint 6).
43. Go to `green_door_1`.
44. Toggle `green_door_1` (unlocking it, consistent with constraint 2 as `yellow_box_1` has been in `room_4`).
45. I'm now in front of `green_door_1`, which is green, connects `room_4` and `room_2`, and is unlocked. This is the goal.

But wait, I'm making things too complex. Let's simplify the plan.

Constraints:
1. At some point, `green_door_1` must be unlocked.
2. Before `green_door_1` is unlocked, `yellow_box_1` must be in `room_4`.
3. At some point, `purple_box_1` must be in `room_1` when I'm holding some object.
4. At some point, I must either hold `yellow_box_1` or `purple_ball_1` must be in `room_2`.
5. At some point, `green_door_1` must be locked.
6. If `green_door_1` is locked, I must be holding some object at that state or later.
7. At some point, I must hold `blue_box_2`.
8. At some point, I must either be in `room_2` or holding `grey_ball_1`.
9. At some point, I must be holding some object.

Goal: I need to be in front of `green_door_1` in `room_4`, and `green_door_1` must be unlocked.

Let's simplify:

1. I'm in `room_4`. I go to `grey_ball_1`.
2. I pick `grey_ball_1` (satisfying constraints 8 and 9, also constraint 6 since I'm holding an object after the state where `green_door_1` is locked).
3. I go to `grey_door_2`.
4. I toggle `grey_door_2` (unlocking it).
5. I go to `room_3` via `grey_door_2`.
6. I go to `blue_box_2`.
7. I drop `grey_ball_1` (freeing my hands).
8. I pick `blue_box_2` (satisfying constraint 7).
9. I go to `yellow_door_1`.
10. I toggle `yellow_door_1` (unlocking it).
11. I go to `room_1` via `yellow_door_1`.
12. I go to `grey_door_1`.
13. I toggle `grey_door_1` (unlocking it).
14. I go to `room_2` via `grey_door_1` (satisfying constraint 8 again).
15. I go to `yellow_box_1`.
16. I drop `blue_box_2` (freeing my hands).
17. I pick `yellow_box_1` (satisfying constraint 4).
18. I go to `grey_door_1`.
19. I go to `room_1` via `grey_door_1`.
20. I go to `yellow_door_1`.
21. I go to `room_3` via `yellow_door_1`.
22. I go to `purple_box_1`.
23. I drop `yellow_box_1` (freeing my hands).
24. I pick `purple_box_1`.
25. I go to `yellow_door_1`.
26. I go to `room_1` via `yellow_door_1` (satisfying constraint 3, since `purple_box_1` is in `room_1` and I'm holding it).
27. I drop `purple_box_1`.
28. I go to `yellow_door_1`.
29. I go to `room_3` via `yellow_door_1`.
30. I go to `yellow_box_1`.
31. I pick `yellow_box_1`.
32. I go to `grey_door_2`.
33. I go to `room_4` via `grey_door_2`.
34. I drop `yellow_box_1` (satisfying constraint 2, since `yellow_box_1` is now in `room_4`).
35. I go to `green_door_1`.
36. I toggle `green_door_1` (unlocking it, which satisfies constraint 1, and it's consistent with constraint 2 since `yellow_box_1` is in `room_4`).
37. The goal is now satisfied: I'm in front of `green_door_1`, it's unlocked, and it connects `room_4` and `room_2`.

But wait, something is still missing. Constraint 5 says, "At some point, `green_door_1` must be locked." Since all doors start locked, this constraint is already satisfied in the initial state.

Let me double-check the final plan to make sure all constraints are satisfied:

1. Initially, all doors are locked, so constraint 5 is satisfied.
2. I'm in `room_4`. I go to `grey_ball_1`.
3. I pick `grey_ball_1` (satisfying constraints 8 and 9, also constraint 6 since I'm holding an object after the state where `green_door_1` is locked).
4. I go to `grey_door_2`.
5. I toggle `grey_door_2` (unlocking it).
6. I go to `room_3` via `grey_door_2`.
7. I go to `blue_box_2`.
8. I drop `grey_ball_1` (freeing my hands).
9. I pick `blue_box_2` (satisfying constraint 7).
10. I go to `yellow_door_1`.
11. I toggle `yellow_door_1` (unlocking it).
12. I go to `room_1` via `yellow_door_1`.
13. I go to `grey_door_1`.
14. I toggle `grey_door_1` (unlocking it).
15. I go to `room_2` via `grey_door_1` (satisfying constraint 8 again).
16. I go to `yellow_box_1`.
17. I drop `blue_box_2` (freeing my hands).
18. I pick `yellow_box_1` (satisfying constraint 4).
19. I go to `grey_door_1`.
20. I go to `room_1` via `grey_door_1`.
21. I go to `yellow_door_1`.
22. I go to `room_3` via `yellow_door_1`.
23. I go to `purple_box_1`.
24. I drop `yellow_box_1` (freeing my hands).
25. I pick `purple_box_1`.
26. I go to `yellow_door_1`.
27. I go to `room_1` via `yellow_door_1` (satisfying constraint 3, since `purple_box_1` is in `room_1` and I'm holding it).
28. I drop `purple_box_1`.
29. I go to `yellow_door_1`.
30. I go to `room_3` via `yellow_door_1`.
31. I go to `yellow_box_1`.
32. I pick `yellow_box_1`.
33. I go to `grey_door_2`.
34. I go to `room_4` via `grey_door_2`.
35. I drop `yellow_box_1` (satisfying constraint 2, since `yellow_box_1` is now in `room_4`).
36. I go to `green_door_1`.
37. I toggle `green_door_1` (unlocking it, which satisfies constraint 1, and it's consistent with constraint 2 since `yellow_box_1` is in `room_4`).
38. The goal is now satisfied: I'm in front of `green_door_1`, it's unlocked, and it connects `room_4` and `room_2`.

That seems to fulfill all constraints and the goal. However, there's one thing: constraint 4 says I must either hold `yellow_box_1` or `purple_ball_1` must be in `room_2`. I pick `yellow_box_1` in step 18, but I drop it in step 24, and that's before I potentially put `purple_ball_1` in `room_2`. But I didn't end up putting `purple_ball_1` in `room_2` (because I didn't need to). Let me look at constraint 4 again. It says:

"The following expression must hold in at least one state: At least one of the following conditions is true: "you are holding yellow_box_1", "purple_ball_1 is in room_2""

So, it's satisfied in step 18 when I'm holding `yellow_box_1`. That's fine.

Let me refine the plan to ensure it's clear and works:

1. I'm in `room_4`. I go to `grey_ball_1`.
2. I pick `grey_ball_1`.
3. I go to `grey_door_2`.
4. I toggle `grey_door_2`.
5. I go to `room_3` via `grey_door_2`.
6. I go to `blue_box_2`.
7. I drop `grey_ball_1`.
8. I pick `blue_box_2`.
9. I go to `yellow_door_1`.
10. I toggle `yellow_door_1`.
11. I go to `room_1` via `yellow_door_1`.
12. I go to `grey_door_1`.
13. I toggle `grey_door_1`.
14. I go to `room_2` via `grey_door_1`.
15. I go to `yellow_box_1`.
16. I drop `blue_box_2`.
17. I pick `yellow_box_1`.
18. I go to `grey_door_1`.
19. I go to `room_1` via `grey_door_1`.
20. I go to `yellow_door_1`.
21. I go to `room_3` via `yellow_door_1`.
22. I go to `purple_box_1`.
23. I drop `yellow_box_1`.
24. I pick `purple_box_1`.
25. I go to `yellow_door_1`.
26. I go to `room_1` via `yellow_door_1`.
27. I drop `purple_box_1`.
28. I go to `yellow_door_1`.
29. I go to `room_3` via `yellow_door_1`.
30. I go to `yellow_box_1`.
31. I pick `yellow_box_1`.
32. I go to `grey_door_2`.
33. I go to `room_4` via `grey_door_2`.
34. I drop `yellow_box_1`.
35. I go to `green_door_1`.
36. I toggle `green_door_1`.

Reviewing again to make sure nothing is missed:

- Constraint 1: `green_door_1` is unlocked in step 36. ✓
- Constraint 2: `yellow_box_1` is in `room_4` from step 34, which is before step 36 when `green_door_1` is unlocked. ✓
- Constraint 3: `purple_box_1` is in `room_1` and I'm holding it in step 26. ✓
- Constraint 4: I'm holding `yellow_box_1` in step 17. ✓
- Constraint 5: `green_door_1` is locked in the initial state. ✓
- Constraint 6: When `green_door_1` is locked (initial state), I hold an object in step 2 and thereafter. ✓
- Constraint 7: I'm holding `blue_box_2` in step 8. ✓
- Constraint 8: I'm in `room_2` in step 14. ✓
- Constraint 9: I'm holding `grey_ball_1` in step 2. ✓
- Goal: After step 36, I'm in front of `green_door_1`, it's unlocked, and it connects `room_4` and `room_2`. ✓

The plan appears to work and meet all constraints and the goal.

Actually, there's one issue I just noticed. In step 35, I go to `green_door_1` from `room_4`. But `green_door_1` connects `room_2` and `room_4`. If I'm in `room_4`, I would need to use the action `gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2` to go in front of the door from inside `room_4`.

Let me correct that:

35. I go to door `green_door_1` from `room_4` to `room_2`.
36. I toggle `green_door_1`.

With this correction, the plan should be fully valid.

Let's format the actions for the plan:

1. `gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_4`
2. `pick grey_ball_1 room_4`
3. `gotodoor grey_door_2 room_4 room_3`
4. `toggle grey_door_2`
5. `gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_2`
6. `gotoobject blue_box_2 room_3`
7. `drop grey_ball_1 room_3`
8. `pick blue_box_2 room_3`
9. `gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1`
10. `toggle yellow_door_1`
11. `gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_1`
12. `gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2`
13. `toggle grey_door_1`
14. `gotoroom room_1 room_2 grey_door_1`
15. `gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_2`
16. `drop blue_box_2 room_2`
17. `pick yellow_box_1 room_2`
18. `gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_1`
19. `gotoroom room_2 room_1 grey_door_1`
20. `gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3`
21. `gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1`
22. `gotoobject purple_box_1 room_3`
23. `drop yellow_box_1 room_3`
24. `pick purple_box_1 room_3`
25. `gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1`
26. `gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_1`
27. `drop purple_box_1 room_1`
28. `gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3`
29. `gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1`
30. `gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_3`
31. `pick yellow_box_1 room_3`
32. `gotodoor grey_door_2 room_3 room_4`
33. `gotoroom room_3 room_4 grey_door_2`
34. `drop yellow_box_1 room_4`
35. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2`
36. `toggle green_door_1`

This should be the correct plan.
