Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. The goal is to end up in front of the green door (green_door_1) connecting room_4 and room_2, with it unlocked. Plus, there are a bunch of constraints to satisfy. Let's start by understanding the initial state and the required goal.

First, the initial state: The agent is in room_4. All doors are locked. The green door (green_door_1) connects room_2 and room_4. To unlock it, the agent needs to be in front of it and toggle it. But first, they need to get there. However, since all doors are locked initially, moving between rooms requires unlocking doors. But unlocking a door requires being in front of it, which requires being in a room connected by that door.

Wait, the agent starts in room_4. The doors connected to room_4 are green_door_1 (to room_2) and grey_door_2 (to room_3). Both are locked. So, the agent can't go directly to room_2 or room_3 unless they unlock those doors. But to unlock a door, they need to be in front of it. So, the agent is in room_4. To get to green_door_1, which connects room_4 and room_2, they need to be in room_4 and go to the door. But is there an object blocking the door in room_4? The initial state says objects can block doors. Let's check the initial objects in room_4: grey_ball_1 and grey_box_2. Are either of these blocking green_door_1? The problem statement says that when you pick up an object, if it was blocking a door, it's no longer blocked. But initially, the problem doesn't state any objects blocking doors. Wait, the preconditions for "goto door" require that there's no object blocking the position in front of the door in the current room. So if the door is in the room and there's an object in front of it, you can't go there. But in the initial state, are any objects blocking the doors?

The initial positions of objects: grey_ball_1 and grey_box_2 are in room_4. Are they blocking the doors? The problem doesn't explicitly state this. Hmm. The problem's initial state doesn't mention any objects blocking doors. So perhaps the doors are not blocked by any objects. Therefore, the agent can go to the door in their current room (room_4) if the door is present. So, in room_4, the doors connected are green_door_1 (to room_2) and grey_door_2 (to room_3). So the agent is in room_4, can go to green_door_1 in room_4, provided that the door is there. Wait, the doors are between rooms. So, for example, green_door_1 connects room_4 and room_2. So in room_4, the agent can go to green_door_1 (since the door is part of room_4's connections). The preconditions for "gotodoor d r1 r2" are that you're in a room connected by d, and no object is blocking the position in front of d in your current room. Since there's no mention of objects blocking doors, perhaps they aren't blocked. So the agent can go to green_door_1 in room_4.

So the plan could be:

1. Go to green_door_1 in room_4 (since they're in room_4).
2. Toggle the door to unlock it.
3. Then go to room_2 via green_door_1.
But wait, the goal is to be in front of green_door_1 (d is green, connects room_4 and room_2, agent is in front of d, and d is not locked). So the final state requires the agent to be in front of green_door_1 and the door is unlocked. So after step 1, they are in front of green_door_1, then toggle it to unlock. Then the door is unlocked. But wait, the toggle action toggles the state. Since green_door_1 is initially locked, toggling it would unlock it. So the steps would be:

- gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2
- toggle green_door_1

But after that, the agent is in front of green_door_1, which is now unlocked. So that satisfies the goal. But wait, the goal requires that the agent is in front of the door (d), which is green, connects room_4 and room_2, and is not locked. So after those two steps, the agent is in front of green_door_1, which is now unlocked. So that would satisfy the goal. But why isn't this the plan? Because there are constraints that must be satisfied during the plan.

Let's check the constraints:

1. At least one state where green_door_1 is not locked. That's achieved when we toggle it, so that's covered.

2. If green_door_1 is not locked in some state, there must be an earlier state where yellow_box_1 is in room_4. So before unlocking green_door_1, we need to have moved yellow_box_1 to room_4. But yellow_box_1 is initially in room_2. So the agent needs to get to room_2, pick up yellow_box_1, bring it to room_4. But to get to room_2 from room_4, the agent needs to unlock green_door_1. Wait, that's a problem. Because the agent can't get to room_2 initially because green_door_1 is locked. So how can they move yellow_box_1 to room_4 before unlocking green_door_1?

Hmm, this is a contradiction. Because to get to room_2, you need to go through green_door_1, but it's locked. Unless there's another path. Let's check the connections. The doors are:

- grey_door_1 connects room_1 and room_2 (locked)
- yellow_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3 (locked)
- green_door_1 connects room_2 and room_4 (locked)
- grey_door_2 connects room_3 and room_4 (locked)

So the agent is in room_4. The only doors from room_4 are green_door_1 (to room_2) and grey_door_2 (to room_3). Both are locked. So initially, the agent is stuck in room_4 unless they can unlock one of these doors.

But to unlock a door, they need to be in front of it. So from room_4, the agent can go to green_door_1 (since they are in room_4), then toggle it to unlock. Wait, but the first action would be gotodoor green_door_1 room4 room2, then toggle. Then green_door_1 is unlocked. Then they can go to room2 via gotoroom room4 room2 green_door_1. Once in room2, they can pick up yellow_box_1. But the constraint says that if green_door_1 is not locked in some state, there must be a prior state where yellow_box_1 is in room4. So, the agent can't unlock green_door_1 before moving yellow_box_1 to room4. But how can they move yellow_box_1 to room4 if they can't get to room2 before unlocking green_door_1?

This seems like a catch-22. Let's think again. The constraint is that whenever green_door_1 is unlocked, there must have been a prior state where yellow_box_1 was in room4. So perhaps the agent needs to first unlock green_door_1, then move to room2, get the yellow_box_1, bring it to room4, and then relock green_door_1, but then unlock it again. But that might complicate things. Alternatively, maybe there's another path. For example, via grey_door_2 to room3, then through yellow_door_1 to room1, then through grey_door_1 to room2. But all those doors are locked initially.

Wait, let's map the rooms:

room_1 is connected to room_2 via grey_door_1 (locked)
room_1 is connected to room_3 via yellow_door_1 (locked)
room_3 is connected to room_4 via grey_door_2 (locked)
room_2 is connected to room_4 via green_door_1 (locked)

So the agent is in room4. The only doors are to room2 (green_door_1) and room3 (grey_door_2). Both locked. So initially, the agent can't leave room4 unless they unlock one of these doors. So the agent must first unlock either green_door_1 or grey_door_2. Let's consider unlocking grey_door_2 first. Grey_door_2 connects room4 to room3. So:

1. gotodoor grey_door_2 room4 room3
2. toggle grey_door_2 (unlock)
3. gotoroom room4 room3 grey_door_2 (now in room3)
In room3, there's blue_box_1, purple_box_1, blue_box_2, and purple_ball_1. From room3, the agent can go to room1 via yellow_door_1 (locked) or back to room4 via grey_door_2 (unlocked). To get to room1, need to unlock yellow_door_1. But that requires being in room3 and going to yellow_door_1 (which connects room3 and room1). So:

4. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room3 room1
5. toggle yellow_door_1 (unlock)
6. gotoroom room3 room1 yellow_door_1 (now in room1)
In room1, there's grey_box_1. From room1, can go to room2 via grey_door_1 (locked). To unlock grey_door_1, need to be in room1 or room2. The agent is in room1, so:

7. gotodoor grey_door_1 room1 room2
8. toggle grey_door_1 (unlock)
9. gotoroom room1 room2 grey_door_1 (now in room2)
In room2, there's yellow_box_1. The agent can pick it up and carry it back to room4. But to do that, they need to go through room1, room3, room4. Let's see:

10. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room2
11. pick yellow_box_1 room2
12. Now holding yellow_box_1. Need to drop it in room4. To get back:

From room2, need to go back to room1 (via grey_door_1), then to room3 (via yellow_door_1), then to room4 (via grey_door_2). But let's check doors:

After steps 8 and 5, grey_door_1 and yellow_door_1 are unlocked. So path is room2 -> room1 (grey_door_1 is unlocked), room1 -> room3 (yellow_door_1 is unlocked), room3 -> room4 (grey_door_2 is unlocked). So:

13. gotoroom room2 room1 grey_door_1
14. gotoroom room1 room3 yellow_door_1
15. gotoroom room3 room4 grey_door_2
16. Now in room4. Drop yellow_box_1 here.

17. drop yellow_box_1 room4

Now yellow_box_1 is in room4. So this satisfies the constraint that before green_door_1 is unlocked, yellow_box_1 was in room4. Wait, but when was green_door_1 unlocked? In this path, green_door_1 was never touched. The agent went via grey_door_2. So in this plan, green_door_1 remains locked. But the goal requires the agent to be in front of green_door_1 (which is in room4) and unlocked. So after step 17, the agent is in room4. Then they can go to green_door_1, unlock it, and be in front of it. But how?

So after dropping yellow_box_1 in room4, the agent can:

18. gotodoor green_door_1 room4 room2
19. toggle green_door_1 (unlock it)
Now, the agent is in front of green_door_1, which is unlocked. That satisfies the goal. So the plan would include steps 1-19. But need to check all constraints.

Let's check the constraints one by one:

1. The following must hold in at least one state: "green_door_1 is not locked". This is achieved in step 19 when we toggle it from locked to unlocked.

2. If green_door_1 is not locked (step 19), then there must be an earlier state where yellow_box_1 is in room4 (step 17). That's satisfied.

3. At least one state where purple_box_1 is in room1 and the agent is holding some object. Let's see. Purple_box_1 is initially in room3. To get it to room1, the agent would need to pick it up in room3 and carry it to room1. But in the current plan, after step 15, the agent is in room4. But to get back to room3, they can use grey_door_2 (unlocked). Then go to room3, pick up purple_box_1, go to room1 via yellow_door_1 (unlocked), drop it there. But this would add steps. However, in the current plan, the agent hasn't moved purple_box_1. So this constraint isn't met yet. So the current plan doesn't satisfy constraint 3. Therefore, the plan needs to include moving purple_box_1 to room1 while holding it. So we need to adjust the plan.

This complicates things. Let's see. So the agent needs to have a state where purple_box_1 is in room1 and they are holding something. So perhaps during the journey, the agent can pick up purple_box_1 in room3, carry it to room1, drop it there, but also have a step where they are holding it. Let's see. Let's adjust the plan.

After step 14 (agent in room1), but before going to room3, maybe go back to room3, pick up purple_box_1, then return to room1. Wait, let's think. Let's re-examine the steps.

Wait, the current steps after picking up yellow_box_1 in room2 (step 11) is to carry it back to room4. But in the process, the agent goes through room1, room3, room4. But perhaps during this process, the agent can make a detour to move purple_box_1 to room1.

Alternatively, after step 9 (agent is in room2), pick up yellow_box_1, then go back to room1 (via grey_door_1), then go to room3 (via yellow_door_1), then in room3, pick up purple_box_1, carry it to room1, drop it, then proceed to carry yellow_box_1 to room4. Let's try:

So steps:

1-8: same as before (unlock grey_door_2, get to room3, unlock yellow_door_1, get to room1, unlock grey_door_1, get to room2)
9. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room2
10. pick yellow_box_1 room2
11. gotoroom room2 room1 grey_door_1 (back to room1)
12. gotoroom room1 room3 yellow_door_1 (back to room3)
13. gotoobject purple_box_1 room3
14. pick purple_box_1 room3 (now holding purple_box_1)
15. gotoroom room3 room1 yellow_door_1 (to room1)
16. drop purple_box_1 room1 (now purple_box_1 is in room1)
17. Now need to go back to room3, then room4 to drop yellow_box_1. But wait, after step 16, the agent is in room1, holding yellow_box_1? No, after step 10, the agent picked up yellow_box_1, then steps 11-16 involve dropping purple_box_1 in room1. Wait, no. Wait, after step 10, agent is holding yellow_box_1. Then step 11: move to room1. Step 12: move to room3. At this point, agent is in room3, holding yellow_box_1. Then step 13: goto purple_box_1 (room3). Then step 14: pick purple_box_1. But agent is already holding yellow_box_1, so can't pick up another object. So this approach won't work. Therefore, the agent needs to drop yellow_box_1 somewhere first before picking up purple_box_1.

Alternative approach:

After step 10 (holding yellow_box_1 in room2), take it to room1:

11. gotoroom room2 room1 grey_door_1 (now in room1)
12. drop yellow_box_1 room1 (now yellow_box_1 is in room1)
13. gotoroom room1 room3 yellow_door_1 (now in room3)
14. gotoobject purple_box_1 room3
15. pick purple_box_1 room3 (now holding it)
16. gotoroom room3 room1 yellow_door_1 (back to room1)
17. drop purple_box_1 room1 (now it's in room1)
18. Now, need to get yellow_box_1 back from room1 to room4. So:

19. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room1
20. pick yellow_box_1 room1
21. gotoroom room1 room3 yellow_door_1
22. gotoroom room3 room4 grey_door_2
23. drop yellow_box_1 room4 (now constraint 2 is satisfied)

But this adds a lot of steps. Then, after this, the agent needs to go to green_door_1 and unlock it.

But this approach would satisfy constraint 3: at some state, purple_box_1 is in room1 and the agent is holding some object (when they picked up purple_box_1 in room3 and carried it to room1). Also, when they pick up yellow_box_1 again, they are holding an object. So that satisfies constraint 3.

Now, checking other constraints:

4. At least one state where either holding yellow_box_1 or purple_ball_1 is in room2. The agent holds yellow_box_1 during steps 10-12 (before dropping it in room1), and again when they pick it up again in step 20. So this condition is met.

5. At least one state where green_door_1 is locked. Initially, it's locked. After step 19 (if we unlock it), then it's unlocked. But the constraint requires that at some state, it's locked. So the initial state counts, but the problem might require that during the plan, it's locked again. Wait, the constraint says "The following expression must hold in at least one state: green_door_1 is locked". Since green_door_1 starts locked, this is already true. But if during the plan, it's unlocked and then maybe relocked, but the initial state is part of the plan's states. So maybe this constraint is already satisfied by the initial state. But the problem might consider the initial state as part of the states. However, the agent's actions may change the state. So if the agent unlocks green_door_1 (step 19), then in that state, it's unlocked. So the constraint requires that at least one state in the plan (including the initial state) has green_door_1 locked. Since the initial state does, this constraint is satisfied.

6. If green_door_1 is locked in some state s, then the agent must be holding an object in s or after. Since the initial state has green_door_1 locked, and the agent is not holding anything then, the constraint requires that after the initial state, the agent holds an object at some point. Which they do (when they pick up yellow_box_1, purple_box_1, etc.). So this is satisfied.

7. At least one state where holding blue_box_2. Blue_box_2 is in room3. So the agent needs to pick it up. In the current plan, the agent goes to room3 in steps 13, 21. Maybe during step 13 (in room3 after dropping yellow_box_1 in room1), they can pick up blue_box_2. Let's adjust:

After step 17 (drop purple_box_1 in room1), the agent is in room1. Then they need to go back to room3 to get yellow_box_1 (wait, no, yellow_box_1 was dropped in room1). Wait, the plan after step 17 would have yellow_box_1 in room1 (from step 12). So when the agent is in room1 (step 17), they can pick up yellow_box_1 again. Then proceed to room3, room4. But to fulfill constraint 7, the agent needs to hold blue_box_2. So perhaps during the trip to room3, they pick up blue_box_2.

Alternative approach:

After step 22 (agent in room3), before going to room4:

23. gotoobject blue_box_2 room3
24. pick blue_box_2 room3 (now holding it)
25. gotoroom room3 room4 grey_door_2 (to room4)
26. drop blue_box_2 room4 (optional, but need to hold it at least once)

This adds steps where the agent holds blue_box_2, satisfying constraint7.

But this complicates the plan further. Let's check if the current steps would include holding blue_box_2. In the original plan, the agent doesn't interact with blue_box_2. So to satisfy constraint7, the agent must have a step where they pick up blue_box_2.

So during the trip to room3, after step 13 (goto purple_box_1), the agent could pick up blue_box_2 instead. But no, they need to pick up purple_box_1 to move it. Alternatively, after moving purple_box_1 to room1, the agent can go back to room3, pick up blue_box_2, carry it to room4. Let's adjust:

After step 17 (drop purple_box_1 in room1), the agent is in room1. They need to go back to room3 to get blue_box_2.

18. gotoroom room1 room3 yellow_door_1 (to room3)
19. gotoobject blue_box_2 room3
20. pick blue_box_2 room3
21. gotoroom room3 room4 grey_door_2 (to room4)
22. drop blue_box_2 room4 (now constraint7 is satisfied)

Then proceed to move yellow_box_1 from room1 to room4:

23. gotoroom room4 room3 grey_door_2 (to room3)
24. gotoroom room3 room1 yellow_door_1 (to room1)
25. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room1
26. pick yellow_box_1 room1
27. gotoroom room1 room3 yellow_door_1
28. gotoroom room3 room4 grey_door_2
29. drop yellow_box_1 room4

Now, after step29, yellow_box_1 is in room4. Then proceed to unlock green_door_1:

30. gotodoor green_door_1 room4 room2
31. toggle green_door_1 (unlock)
Now, the agent is in front of green_door_1, which is unlocked. Goal achieved.

This adds steps, but ensures all constraints are met.

Other constraints:

8. At least one state where agent is in room2 or holding grey_ball_1. In the current plan, the agent is in room2 in step9 (when they picked up yellow_box_1). So that satisfies the condition. Alternatively, if the agent picks up grey_ball_1 in room4. Let's check. grey_ball_1 is in room4 initially. The agent could pick it up at some point. For example, after dropping yellow_box_1 in room4 (step29), the agent could pick up grey_ball_1. But that's optional. Since the agent was in room2 earlier (step9), constraint8 is satisfied.

9. At least one state where holding some object. This is satisfied multiple times (when holding yellow_box_1, purple_box_1, blue_box_2).

Now, putting all together, the plan would look like:

1. gotodoor grey_door_2 room4 room3
2. toggle grey_door_2
3. gotoroom room4 room3 grey_door_2
4. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room3 room1
5. toggle yellow_door_1
6. gotoroom room3 room1 yellow_door_1
7. gotodoor grey_door_1 room1 room2
8. toggle grey_door_1
9. gotoroom room1 room2 grey_door_1
10. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room2
11. pick yellow_box_1 room2
12. gotoroom room2 room1 grey_door_1
13. gotoroom room1 room3 yellow_door_1
14. gotoobject purple_box_1 room3
15. pick purple_box_1 room3
16. gotoroom room3 room1 yellow_door_1
17. drop purple_box_1 room1
18. gotoroom room1 room3 yellow_door_1
19. gotoobject blue_box_2 room3
20. pick blue_box_2 room3
21. gotoroom room3 room4 grey_door_2
22. drop blue_box_2 room4
23. gotoroom room4 room3 grey_door_2
24. gotoroom room3 room1 yellow_door_1
25. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room1
26. pick yellow_box_1 room1
27. gotoroom room1 room3 yellow_door_1
28. gotoroom room3 room4 grey_door_2
29. drop yellow_box_1 room4
30. gotodoor green_door_1 room4 room2
31. toggle green_door_1

This plan seems to cover all constraints. Let's verify each constraint:

1. green_door_1 is not locked: step31.

2. Before step31, yellow_box_1 is in room4 (step29).

3. purple_box_1 is in room1 (step17) and agent was holding it (step15-17).

4. Agent held yellow_box_1 (steps11,25-29).

5. green_door_1 was locked in initial state and steps1-30.

6. When green_door_1 was locked (initial state), agent later holds objects.

7. Agent holds blue_box_2 (steps20-22).

8. Agent was in room2 (step9).

9. Agent holds objects multiple times.

Additionally, the final state has the agent in front of green_door_1, which is unlocked.

But wait, step30: gotodoor green_door_1 room4 room2. Then step31: toggle green_door_1 (which was locked, now unlocked). So the agent is in front of green_door_1, which is now unlocked. Goal achieved.

This plan is quite long. Is there a shorter way? Let's think. For example, after unlocking grey_door_2 and getting to room3, perhaps the agent can pick up purple_box_1 and carry it to room1 earlier. Also, maybe combine carrying purple_box_1 and blue_box_2.

Alternatively, after unlocking grey_door_2 and yellow_door_1, the agent can go to room3, pick up blue_box_2 and purple_box_1 in one trip. But they can't carry both at once. So maybe:

In room3, pick up purple_box_1, drop it in room1. Then return to room3, pick up blue_box_2, drop it somewhere. But this adds steps. Alternatively, the agent can pick up blue_box_2 first, drop it in room1, then pick up purple_box_1.

But regardless, the plan seems to require many steps. However, the problem asks for an optimal plan (shortest possible). So perhaps there's a shorter path.

Alternative approach: Maybe the agent can unlock green_door_1 first, but how? Because to unlock it, they need to be in front of it in room4. So:

1. gotodoor green_door_1 room4 room2 (possible because they're in room4)
2. toggle green_door_1 (unlocks it)
But according to constraint2, if green_door_1 is unlocked in step2, then there must be an earlier state where yellow_box_1 is in room4. But in this case, there isn't. So this approach violates constraint2.

So the agent can't unlock green_door_1 until after moving yellow_box_1 to room4.

But how to move yellow_box_1 to room4 without first unlocking green_door_1? As previously, the agent must take the long route through grey_door_2, room3, room1, room2, then carry yellow_box_1 back through room1, room3, room4.

Thus, the minimal steps would involve the longer path. The plan I outlined earlier might be the shortest possible. But perhaps some steps can be optimized.

For example, after step17 (purple_box_1 in room1), the agent is in room1. Instead of going back to room3 to pick up blue_box_2, maybe the agent can pick up yellow_box_1 in room1 and carry it to room4, and in room4, pick up blue_box_2 from room3.

Wait, blue_box_2 is in room3. To get it, the agent needs to go back to room3. So after dropping purple_box_1 in room1 (step17), agent is in room1. Then:

18. gotoroom room1 room3 yellow_door_1
19. gotoobject blue_box_2 room3
20. pick blue_box_2 room3
21. gotoroom room3 room4 grey_door_2
22. drop blue_box_2 room4 (satisfies constraint7)
23. Now, agent is in room4. Need to get yellow_box_1 from room1 to room4. So:

24. gotoroom room4 room3 grey_door_2
25. gotoroom room3 room1 yellow_door_1
26. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room1
27. pick yellow_box_1 room1
28. gotoroom room1 room3 yellow_door_1
29. gotoroom room3 room4 grey_door_2
30. drop yellow_box_1 room4
31. gotodoor green_door_1 room4 room2
32. toggle green_door_1

This reduces steps by combining some movements. Let's count the steps:

Original steps after step17: 18-32 is 15 steps. Total steps would be 32. But maybe some steps can be further optimized.

Wait, after step17, the agent is in room1. Then step18: to room3, step19-20: pick blue_box_2. Step21: to room4. Then steps24-30 to bring yellow_box_1. So steps:

17. drop purple_box_1 room1
18. gotoroom room1 room3 yellow_door_1
19. gotoobject blue_box_2 room3
20. pick blue_box_2 room3
21. gotoroom room3 room4 grey_door_2
22. drop blue_box_2 room4
23. gotoroom room4 room3 grey_door_2
24. gotoroom room3 room1 yellow_door_1
25. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room1
26. pick yellow_box_1 room1
27. gotoroom room1 room3 yellow_door_1
28. gotoroom room3 room4 grey_door_2
29. drop yellow_box_1 room4
30. gotodoor green_door_1 room4 room2
31. toggle green_door_1

Total steps: 31. But in this case, steps 23-28 are moving from room4 to room3 to room1, pick up yellow_box_1, then back to room4. This could be optimized. After step22 (agent in room4), to get yellow_box_1 from room1 to room4, the agent must go through room3 and room1. So steps23-28 are necessary.

But perhaps there's a way to carry yellow_box_1 and blue_box_2 in the same trip. But since the agent can only carry one object at a time, not possible.

Alternatively, after step20, the agent is holding blue_box_2. They can drop it in room3, then pick up yellow_box_1. But no, yellow_box_1 is in room1.

Hmm. It seems the plan is quite long, but given the constraints, it's necessary. Let's check if all constraints are met:

1. green_door_1 unlocked in step31.

2. yellow_box_1 is in room4 after step29.

3. purple_box_1 in room1 after step17, and agent was holding it in step15-17.

4. Agent held yellow_box_1 (steps11,26-29).

5. green_door_1 was locked in initial state.

6. Agent held objects after initial state.

7. Agent held blue_box_2 in steps20-22.

8. Agent was in room2 in step9.

9. Agent held objects multiple times.

This seems to cover all constraints. However, the plan length is 31 steps. Is there a shorter way?

Alternative idea: Maybe instead of moving purple_box_1 to room1, the agent can pick up purple_ball_1 in room3 and move it to room2 to satisfy constraint4 ("you are holding yellow_box_1 or purple_ball_1 is in room2").

If the agent picks up purple_ball_1 in room3 and drops it in room2, then constraint4 is satisfied. This might save steps compared to moving purple_box_1 to room1. Let's explore this.

Revised plan:

After unlocking the doors as before (steps1-9):

9. In room2, pick yellow_box_1.

10. Carry yellow_box_1 through room1, room3, room4.

But also, in room3, pick up purple_ball_1 and drop it in room2.

Steps:

1. gotodoor grey_door_2 room4 room3
2. toggle grey_door_2
3. gotoroom room4 room3 grey_door_2
4. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room3 room1
5. toggle yellow_door_1
6. gotoroom room3 room1 yellow_door_1
7. gotodoor grey_door_1 room1 room2
8. toggle grey_door_1
9. gotoroom room1 room2 grey_door_1
10. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room2
11. pick yellow_box_1 room2
12. gotoroom room2 room1 grey_door_1
13. gotoroom room1 room3 yellow_door_1
14. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room3
15. pick purple_ball_1 room3
16. gotoroom room3 room1 yellow_door_1
17. gotoroom room1 room2 grey_door_1
18. drop purple_ball_1 room2 (now purple_ball_1 is in room2, satisfying constraint4)
19. gotoroom room2 room1 grey_door_1
20. gotoroom room1 room3 yellow_door_1
21. gotoroom room3 room4 grey_door_2
22. drop yellow_box_1 room4 (constraint2 satisfied)
23. gotodoor green_door_1 room4 room2
24. toggle green_door_1

Now, check constraints:

3. At least one state where purple_box_1 is in room1 and agent is holding something. But in this plan, purple_box_1 is never moved. So this constraint is not met. Thus, this approach fails constraint3.

Therefore, the agent must move purple_box_1 to room1.

Thus, the original plan is necessary. Hence, the plan with 31 steps is required. But perhaps there's a shorter way.

Alternative approach for constraint3: When the agent picks up purple_box_1 in room3 and carries it to room1, even if they drop it there, there's a state where they are holding it (when they pick it up). So step15: pick purple_box_1, step16: move to room1, step17: drop it. So during step15-17, the agent is holding purple_box_1, and after step17, it's in room1. This satisfies constraint3.

So the plan must include this.

Now, considering all constraints and the need to move multiple objects, the initial long plan seems necessary. Thus, the optimal plan would be as outlined earlier.
