Okay, let me try to figure out how to solve this planning problem. So, the goal is to get a yellow ball that I'm in front of. The initial state is that I'm in room_2, and there's a yellow_ball_1 there. But there are several constraints I need to satisfy along the way. Let me break down the problem step by step.

First, the goal is to have a yellow ball (v) where I'm in front of it. The yellow_ball_1 is in room_2 initially. So maybe I can just go to that ball and be in front of it. But wait, there are constraints that must be met during the plan.

Looking at the constraints:

1. At some state, I must be holding an object.
2. At some state, I must be in front of blue_door_3.
3. At some state, I must be in room_3 and purple_ball_1 is in room_3 (but initially, purple_ball_1 is in room_4. So I need to move it to room_3? But how? Wait, can I move objects? The actions include picking and dropping. So maybe I need to carry purple_ball_1 from room_4 to room_3 and drop it there. But how to get to room_4? The doors are all locked initially.

Wait, the initial state says all doors are locked. So blue_door_1, blue_door_2, blue_door_3, and green_door_1 are all locked. So to move between rooms, I need to unlock the doors first. But to unlock a door, I need to toggle it, which requires being in front of it. But to get in front of a door, I need to go to it, which requires that the door is not blocked by an object. So first, check if any doors are blocked.

In room_2, the doors connected are blue_door_1 (connecting to room_1) and blue_door_3 (connecting to room_4). The initial objects in room_2 are yellow_ball_1, grey_box_1, yellow_box_1, grey_box_2. So maybe these boxes are blocking the doors? Wait, the problem states that for "goto door", the preconditions are that you are in a room connected by the door and there's no object blocking the position in front of the door. So if the boxes are in front of the doors in room_2, then I can't go to the door. But the initial state doesn't mention any objects blocking doors. The problem says that objects may block doors if they are in front of them. But the initial state doesn't specify any such blockages. So perhaps by default, doors are not blocked unless an object is placed in front. So in the initial state, since grey_box_1, etc., are in room_2, but it's not stated that they are in front of a door, so maybe they aren't. So maybe the doors are accessible.

So first, I need to unlock doors to move around. Let's see:

Starting in room_2. The doors here are blue_door_1 (to room_1) and blue_door_3 (to room_4). Both are locked. To unlock them, I need to go in front of them and toggle. But to go to the door, I need to be in the same room. Since I'm in room_2, I can go to blue_door_1 or blue_door_3.

Wait, the "gotodoor" action requires that you are in a room connected by the door, and that there's no object blocking the position in front of the door. Assuming no objects are blocking, then I can go to the door. So first, let's try to unlock blue_door_3 (since room_4 has purple_ball_1 and blue_ball_1, but maybe that's needed for the constraints). But the third constraint requires that at some point I'm in room_3 and purple_ball_1 is in room_3. Since purple_ball_1 is initially in room_4, I need to move it to room_3. So I need to get to room_4, pick up the purple_ball_1, take it to room_3, and drop it there. But how to get to room_4? Through blue_door_3, which is locked. So first, unlock blue_door_3.

But to unlock blue_door_3, I need to be in front of it. So I can do gotodoor blue_door_3 room_2 room_4 (since in room_2, connected via blue_door_3 to room_4). Then toggle it. Then go to room_4. But wait, after unlocking blue_door_3, I can go to room_4. Then in room_4, I can pick up purple_ball_1. Then I need to bring it to room_3. But how? From room_4, the doors are blue_door_3 (to room_2) and green_door_1 (to room_3). But green_door_1 is locked. So I need to unlock green_door_1 as well. But to unlock green_door_1, I need to go to it. Which room is green_door_1 in? It connects room_3 and room_4. So from room_4, green_door_1 is connected to room_3. So in room_4, I can go to green_door_1. Then toggle it to unlock. Then go to room_3 via green_door_1. Then drop the purple_ball_1 there. That would satisfy the third constraint (since at that point, I'm in room_3 and purple_ball_1 is there).

But let's check the other constraints:

Constraint 4: At least one of "you are in front of yellow_box_1" or "grey_box_1 is in room_4". So I need to either go in front of yellow_box_1 (which is in room_2) or move grey_box_1 to room_4. Moving grey_box_1 would require picking it up and dropping it in room_4. But to pick it up, I need to be in room_2, which is possible. Then carry it through blue_door_3 to room_4. So perhaps that's an option.

Constraint 5: Must be in room_1 at some point. So need to go to room_1. The door connecting room_2 and room_1 is blue_door_1, which is locked. So need to unlock it. So in room_2, go to blue_door_1, toggle it, then go to room_1. That would satisfy constraint 5.

Constraint 6: At some state, be in front of grey_box_1 and green_door_1 is unlocked. So green_door_1 is initially locked. So need to unlock it. Which is done by toggling it when in front. So after unlocking green_door_1 (which is needed to get to room_3 from room_4), then maybe later, when I'm in front of grey_box_1, which is in room_2, but green_door_1's state would already be unlocked. Wait, but the grey_box_1 is in room_2. So how can I be in front of grey_box_1 and have green_door_1 be unlocked? Since green_door_1 is in room_3 and room_4. So perhaps after unlocking green_door_1, I can go back to room_2, go in front of grey_box_1. At that point, green_door_1 is unlocked, so that condition is true. So that would satisfy constraint 6.

But let's outline the steps:

1. Start in room_2. Need to unlock doors to move.

First, unlock blue_door_3 to get to room_4.

Action: goto door blue_door_3 room_2 room_4 (precondition: in room_2, which we are. Also, no object blocking. Assuming that's true.)

Then toggle blue_door_3 to unlock it.

Then goto room_4 via blue_door_3.

Now in room_4. Pick up purple_ball_1.

But need to unlock green_door_1 to go to room_3.

In room_4, go to green_door_1 (gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3).

Toggle green_door_1 to unlock.

Then goto room_3 via green_door_1.

Now in room_3. Drop purple_ball_1 here. That satisfies constraint 3 (since in room_3 and purple_ball_1 is there).

But also, need to hold an object at some point (constraint 1). So picking up purple_ball_1 satisfies that.

But then, after dropping it, we are not holding anything. So need to pick something else? Or maybe just once is enough.

Now, need to get to room_1. The door blue_door_1 connects room_2 and room_1. But blue_door_1 is locked. So from room_2, need to go to blue_door_1, toggle it.

But to get back to room_2, perhaps from room_3, we can go via room_1 or room_4? Wait, room_3 is connected to room_1 via blue_door_2, which is locked. So need to unlock blue_door_2 as well.

Wait, the initial state says blue_door_2 connects room_1 and room_3, and it's locked. So to go from room_3 to room_1, need to unlock blue_door_2.

But how to get to room_1. Let's see:

Current path after dropping purple_ball_1 in room_3: we are in room_3. From here, to get to room_1, need to go through blue_door_2. So:

In room_3, go to blue_door_2 (gotodoor blue_door_2 room_3 room_1). But blue_door_2 is locked. So toggle it to unlock. Then go to room_1.

But wait, we were in room_3. So goto room_1 via blue_door_2. Then that would satisfy constraint 5 (being in room_1).

But how to get back to room_2 to handle the boxes or other constraints?

Alternatively, after handling room_3 and room_4, maybe we need to go back to room_2 to unlock blue_door_1.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to first unlock all necessary doors.

But this is getting complicated. Let's try to outline the steps:

Initial steps:

1. Unlock blue_door_3 (from room_2) to access room_4.

Actions:

goto door blue_door_3 room_2 room_4

toggle blue_door_3 (now unlocked)

gotoroom room_2 room_4 blue_door_3 (now in room_4)

Now in room_4. Need to get purple_ball_1 to room_3.

To do that, unlock green_door_1 (connecting room_4 and room_3):

goto door green_door_1 room_4 room_3

toggle green_door_1 (unlock)

gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1 (now in room_3)

Now, in room_3. Drop purple_ball_1 here.

But wait, we need to pick up purple_ball_1 first. So in room_4:

gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4

pick purple_ball_1 room_4

Then carry it to room_3.

So after entering room_4, pick the ball, then go to green_door_1, unlock it, go to room_3, then drop it.

So steps in room_4:

After arriving in room_4:

gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4

pick purple_ball_1 room_4

Then go to green_door_1:

gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3

toggle green_door_1

gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1 (now in room_3)

drop purple_ball_1 room_3 (but need to be in front of an empty position to drop. Wait, when you drop, you have to be in front of an empty position. So after entering room_3, perhaps gotoempty, then drop.

Wait, after entering room_3, you are no longer in front of anything. So you can drop anywhere. Let's see:

After entering room_3, you are in room_3. To drop the purple_ball_1, you need to be in front of an empty position. So perhaps:

gotoempty (in room_3)

drop purple_ball_1 room_3

Now, purple_ball_1 is in room_3. That satisfies constraint 3.

Now, need to get to room_1. From room_3, the door to room_1 is blue_door_2, which is locked. So:

gotodoor blue_door_2 room_3 room_1

toggle blue_door_2 (unlock)

gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_2 (now in room_1). That satisfies constraint 5.

Now, need to go back to room_2 to handle other constraints. From room_1, the door to room_2 is blue_door_1, which is locked. So:

gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2

toggle blue_door_1 (unlock)

gotoroom room_1 room_2 blue_door_1 (now in room_2)

Now, in room_2. Need to satisfy constraint 4: either be in front of yellow_box_1 (which is in room_2) or have grey_box_1 in room_4. Let's consider the first option, as it's easier. So gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_2. That satisfies the "in front of yellow_box_1" part of constraint 4.

But also, need to satisfy constraint 6: be in front of grey_box_1 and green_door_1 is unlocked. So after unlocking green_door_1 (which we did earlier), we can go to grey_box_1 in room_2.

So steps in room_2:

gotoobject grey_box_1 room_2

At this point, green_door_1 is already unlocked (since we toggled it earlier). So being in front of grey_box_1 and green_door_1 is unlocked satisfies constraint 6.

Now, the other constraints: constraint 2 requires being in front of blue_door_3. We did that when we initially went to unlock it. So that's already satisfied.

Constraint 1: holding an object. We held purple_ball_1 when moving it, so that's satisfied.

Now, the final goal is to be in front of a yellow ball. The yellow_ball_1 is in room_2. So after handling all constraints, we can go to it.

But let's check if we have already passed through that. Wait, after returning to room_2, perhaps we can directly go to yellow_ball_1.

So after returning to room_2:

gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2

But then, are we holding anything? No. So that's okay. So the final action is to gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2.

But wait, the problem says the goal is "There is a ball v such that v is yellow and you are in front of v". Since yellow_ball_1 is in room_2, and we can be in front of it, that's the goal.

Now, let's check the order of actions and constraints.

Let me outline the plan step by step:

1. goto door blue_door_3 room_2 room_4 (pre: in room_2, door connects to room_4, no blockage)

2. toggle blue_door_3 (unlocks it)

3. gotoroom room_2 room_4 blue_door_3 (now in room_4)

4. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4

5. pick purple_ball_1 room_4 (now holding it, satisfies constraint 1)

6. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3

7. toggle green_door_1 (unlocks it)

8. gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1 (now in room_3)

9. gotoempty (to have an empty spot to drop)

10. drop purple_ball_1 room_3 (now in room_3, purple_ball_1 here, satisfies constraint 3)

11. gotodoor blue_door_2 room_3 room_1

12. toggle blue_door_2 (unlocks it)

13. gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_2 (now in room_1, satisfies constraint 5)

14. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2

15. toggle blue_door_1 (unlocks it)

16. gotoroom room_1 room_2 blue_door_1 (back to room_2)

17. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_2 (now in front of grey_box_1, and green_door_1 is unlocked, satisfies constraint 6)

18. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_2 (satisfies constraint 4's first condition)

But wait, constraint 4 requires at least one of "in front of yellow_box_1" or "grey_box_1 in room_4". So either 17 or 18 would satisfy. But since step 17 is in front of grey_box_1 (but that's not part of constraint 4; constraint 4 is about yellow_box_1 or grey_box_1 in room_4). So step 17 is for constraint 6. Step 18 is for constraint 4. But do we need to do step 18?

Alternatively, maybe moving grey_box_1 to room_4 would also satisfy constraint 4. Let's see:

If we pick up grey_box_1 in room_2, carry it to room_4, and drop it there. Then grey_box_1 would be in room_4, satisfying constraint 4. But that would require additional steps.

But if we do step 18 (goto yellow_box_1), that's easier. So doing step 18 would satisfy constraint 4.

But let's check. The constraint is "At least one of the following conditions is true: 'you are in front of yellow_box_1', 'grey_box_1 is in room_4'". So either one. So if during the plan, we are in front of yellow_box_1 at any step, that's sufficient. So step 18 (gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_2) would satisfy that. So including that step.

After that, the final step is to gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2 to satisfy the goal.

So the full plan would look like:

1. goto door blue_door_3 room_2 room_4

2. toggle blue_door_3

3. gotoroom room_2 room_4 blue_door_3

4. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4

5. pick purple_ball_1 room_4

6. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3

7. toggle green_door_1

8. gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1

9. gotoempty

10. drop purple_ball_1 room_3

11. gotodoor blue_door_2 room_3 room_1

12. toggle blue_door_2

13. gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_2

14. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2

15. toggle blue_door_1

16. gotoroom room_1 room_2 blue_door_1

17. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_2

18. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_2

19. gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2

Wait, but after step 16, we are back in room_2. Then step 17: gotoobject yellow_box_1 (satisfies constraint 4). Then step 18: gotoobject grey_box_1 (satisfies constraint 6, since green_door_1 is unlocked by step 7). Then step 19: goto yellow_ball_1 to achieve the goal.

But do we need step 18? Because constraint 6 requires being in front of grey_box_1 and green_door_1 is unlocked. So after step 7, green_door_1 is unlocked. So when we go to grey_box_1 in step 18, that's in room_2. At that state, green_door_1 is unlocked. So that satisfies constraint 6.

So yes, steps 17 and 18 are needed.

But let's check if the order is correct. Let me verify each constraint:

Constraint 1: holding an object. This is satisfied when we pick purple_ball_1 in step 5.

Constraint 2: in front of blue_door_3. This happens in step 1 (goto door blue_door_3), which is in room_2. So yes.

Constraint 3: in room_3 and purple_ball_1 there. After step 10, purple_ball_1 is in room_3. And steps 8-10 are in room_3. So yes.

Constraint 4: in front of yellow_box_1 or grey_box_1 in room_4. Step 17 is in front of yellow_box_1. So yes.

Constraint 5: in room_1. Step 13 brings us to room_1. So yes.

Constraint 6: in front of grey_box_1 and green_door_1 not locked. After step 7, green_door_1 is unlocked. Step 18 is in front of grey_box_1, so yes.

Then the final step (19) achieves the goal.

Now, is this the optimal plan? Let's count the steps. The current plan is 19 steps. Maybe there's a shorter way.

Alternative approach: after unlocking blue_door_3 and green_door_1, maybe there's a way to combine steps. Let's see.

Alternatively, after step 10 (dropping purple_ball_1 in room_3), we can go to room_4 via green_door_1, but that's not needed. Wait, maybe after dropping, we can go to room_4 again, but that's unnecessary.

Alternatively, after step 10, go to room_4, pick grey_box_1 and move it. But that's more steps.

Alternatively, can we satisfy constraint 4 by moving grey_box_1 to room_4? Let's say after step 3 (in room_4), go back to room_2, pick grey_box_1, take it to room_4, drop it. But that would require:

After step 3, in room_4:

gotoroom room_4 room_2 blue_door_3 (but door is unlocked now)

gotoobject grey_box_1 room_2

pick grey_box_1 room_2

gotoroom room_2 room_4 blue_door_3

drop grey_box_1 room_4

That would add several steps, but maybe saves on later steps. But I think the original approach is shorter.

Alternatively, perhaps when we are in room_2 after returning, we can goto yellow_box_1 (step 17) and that satisfies constraint 4, so no need to move grey_box_1. That's better.

So the initial plan seems valid, but let's check if any steps can be optimized.

Wait, after step 16 (back in room_2), we need to goto yellow_box_1 (step17), then goto grey_box_1 (step18), then goto yellow_ball_1 (step19). But perhaps after step16, can we go directly to grey_box_1, then to yellow_box_1, then to yellow_ball_1. Or maybe combine them.

But each gotoobject requires moving to that object. So each step is necessary.

Alternatively, after step16, we can first goto grey_box_1 (satisfying constraint 6), then goto yellow_box_1 (constraint4), then goto yellow_ball_1. But that's the same number of steps.

Another optimization: maybe when we first unlock blue_door_1 (step14 and 15), we can go to room_1 (step13 is already there), then unlock blue_door_1 from room_1. Wait, step13 is in room_1. Then step14 is goto door blue_door_1 in room_1, toggle it, then go back to room_2. So that's correct.

Is there any redundancy? For example, after unlocking blue_door_2 (step12), we go to room_1 (step13), which is correct.

Another possible optimization: when in room_3 after dropping purple_ball_1, can we go directly to room_1 via blue_door_2 (after unlocking it), then from room_1 to room_2 via blue_door_1 (unlocking it). Then in room_2, handle the constraints. So steps are necessary.

I think the plan as outlined is valid and optimal. Let me check again for any missing steps or precondition violations.

Preconditions check:

Step1: goto door blue_door_3 room_2 room_4. Pre: in room_2 (yes), door connects room_2 and room_4 (yes), no blockage (assumed yes).

Step2: toggle blue_door_3. Pre: in front of blue_door_3 (after step1, yes).

Step3: gotoroom room_2 room_4 blue_door_3. Pre: in room_2 (yes), adjacent to room_4 (yes), door unlocked (yes, after step2).

Step4: gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4. Pre: in room_4 (yes), same room as object.

Step5: pick purple_ball_1 room_4. Pre: in room_4 (yes), not holding anything (yes).

Step6: gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3. Pre: in room_4 (yes), door connects to room_3 (yes), no blockage (assumed yes).

Step7: toggle green_door_1. Pre: in front of green_door_1 (yes).

Step8: gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1. Pre: in room_4 (yes), door unlocked (yes after step7).

Step9: gotoempty. Pre: always allowed.

Step10: drop purple_ball_1 room_3. Pre: holding it (yes), in front of empty (after step9).

Step11: gotodoor blue_door_2 room_3 room_1. Pre: in room_3 (yes), door connects to room_1 (yes), no blockage.

Step12: toggle blue_door_2. Pre: in front of it.

Step13: gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_2. Pre: door unlocked (yes after step12).

Step14: gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2. Pre: in room_1 (yes), door connects to room_2 (yes).

Step15: toggle blue_door_1. Pre: in front of it.

Step16: gotoroom room_1 room_2 blue_door_1. Pre: door unlocked (yes after step15).

Step17: gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_2. Pre: in room_2 (yes).

Step18: gotoobject grey_box_1 room_2. Pre: in room_2 (yes).

Step19: gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2. Pre: in room_2 (yes).

All preconditions seem satisfied. All constraints are met in the steps:

- Constraint1: step5 (holding purple_ball_1).

- Constraint2: step1 (in front of blue_door_3).

- Constraint3: after step10, in room_3 with purple_ball_1 there.

- Constraint4: step17 (in front of yellow_box_1).

- Constraint5: step13 (in room_1).

- Constraint6: step18 (in front of grey_box_1) and green_door_1 is unlocked (after step7).

Thus, the plan is valid. Now, is there a shorter plan? Let's see.

Is there a way to combine some steps? For example, after step16 (back in room_2), can we go directly to yellow_ball_1, but that would skip handling the constraints. But no, because constraints 4 and 6 require specific steps.

Alternatively, perhaps after step16, we can goto grey_box_1 (satisfy constraint6) and then goto yellow_box_1 (satisfy constraint4), then goto yellow_ball_1. That's three steps. Which is what the plan has.

Another possible optimization: after step10, when in room_3, instead of going to room_1, maybe go back to room_4 and then to room_2 via blue_door_3. But that might not save steps.

Alternatively, after step10, from room_3, can we go to room_4, then to room_2, and unlock blue_door_1 from room_2. But that would require:

In room_3, after step10:

gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_1 (since green_door_1 is unlocked)

Then from room_4, go back to room_2 via blue_door_3.

Then unlock blue_door_1 from room_2.

But this might save steps. Let's compare:

Original steps after step10:

11. gotodoor blue_door_2 room_3 room_1

12. toggle blue_door_2

13. gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_2

14. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2

15. toggle blue_door_1

16. gotoroom room_1 room_2 blue_door_1

That's 6 steps.

Alternative path:

After step10:

gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_1 (1 step)

Then from room_4, goto door blue_door_3 room_4 room_2 (but already unlocked)

gotoroom room_4 room_2 blue_door_3 (now in room_2)

Then unlock blue_door_1 (steps similar to original plan):

gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1

toggle blue_door_1

gotoroom room_2 room_1 blue_door_1 (now in room_1)

But need to get back to room_2 again. So steps would be:

11. gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_1

12. gotoroom room_4 room_2 blue_door_3

13. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1

14. toggle blue_door_1

15. gotoroom room_2 room_1 blue_door_1 (now in room_1)

16. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2

17. toggle blue_door_1 (lock it again? No, because we need to get back to room_2. Wait, no: after step15, we are in room_1. Then step16 is goto door blue_door_1, toggle (unlock), but it's already unlocked. Wait, initial state: blue_door_1 was locked. After step14, we unlocked it. So in step16, toggling would lock it again. But we need to go back to room_2. So after step15 (in room_1), need to go back to room_2 via blue_door_1, which is unlocked. So step16 would be gotoroom room_1 room_2 blue_door_1. So:

11. gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_1

12. gotoroom room_4 room_2 blue_door_3

13. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1

14. toggle blue_door_1 (unlocks it)

15. gotoroom room_2 room_1 blue_door_1 (now in room_1, satisfying constraint5)

16. gotoroom room_1 room_2 blue_door_1 (back to room_2)

Then proceed to handle constraints 4 and 6.

Total steps for this alternative path: steps11-16 are 6 steps, same as original steps11-16. But then we still need to handle the constraints 4,6, and goal. So total steps would be same.

Thus, no optimization here.

Therefore, the initial plan seems to be optimal with 19 steps. But wait, in the initial plan, steps 17-19 are:

17. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_2

18. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_2

19. gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2

But after step16, we are in room_2. We need to be in front of yellow_box_1 and grey_box_1. But maybe we can combine these steps if they are in the same room. However, each gotoobject requires a separate action. So those steps are necessary.

Alternatively, if after step16, we can goto yellow_ball_1 directly. But that would not satisfy constraints 4 and 6. So those steps are required.

Hence, the plan is optimal.
