```
gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2
```
``` 

The agent starts in room_2 where yellow_ball_1 is located. Since all doors are locked but the goal requires being in front of a yellow ball, the optimal solution is to directly navigate to yellow_ball_1 within the same room using the "gotoobject" action. This satisfies the goal in the minimal number of steps.
