Let me understand the problem, the initial state, and the goal, and then I'll develop a valid plan.

Initial state:
- I'm in room_2
- yellow_ball_1 is in room_2
- grey_box_1 is in room_2
- yellow_box_1 is in room_2
- grey_box_2 is in room_2
- yellow_ball_2 is in room_3
- green_box_1 is in room_3
- purple_ball_1 is in room_4
- blue_ball_1 is in room_4
- All of the objects have their respective colors
- I'm not holding any object
- All doors (blue_door_1, blue_door_2, blue_door_3, green_door_1) are locked
- The room connections are as described: 
  * room_1-room_2 via blue_door_1
  * room_1-room_3 via blue_door_2
  * room_2-room_4 via blue_door_3
  * room_3-room_4 via green_door_1
- I have visited room_2

Goal:
- Be in front of a yellow ball (either yellow_ball_1 or yellow_ball_2)

Constraints:
1. At some point, I must be holding some object
2. At some point, I must be in front of blue_door_3
3. At some point, I must be in room_3 with purple_ball_1 also in room_3
4. At some point, I must either be in front of yellow_box_1 or have grey_box_1 in room_4
5. At some point, I must be in room_1
6. At some point, I must be in front of grey_box_1 with green_door_1 unlocked

Let's think about how to satisfy these constraints while achieving the goal.

First, I'll outline a rough sketch of the plan:

1. To achieve constraint 2: Go in front of blue_door_3 in room_2.
2. Toggle blue_door_3 to unlock it.
3. Go to room_4 through blue_door_3.
4. Pick up purple_ball_1 from room_4.
5. Toggle green_door_1 to unlock it.
6. Go to room_3 through green_door_1 (now I'm in room_3 with purple_ball_1, satisfying constraint 3).
7. Drop purple_ball_1 in room_3.
8. Toggle blue_door_2 to unlock it.
9. Go to room_1 through blue_door_2 (satisfying constraint 5).
10. Toggle blue_door_1 to unlock it.
11. Go to room_2 through blue_door_1.
12. Go in front of grey_box_1 (satisfying constraint 6 as green_door_1 is already unlocked).
13. Pick up grey_box_1 (satisfying constraint 1, as I'm now holding an object).
14. Go in front of yellow_box_1 (satisfying constraint 4).
15. Go in front of yellow_ball_1 (achieving the goal).

Let's check if this plan is valid and whether it meets all the constraints:

- Constraint 1: I'm holding grey_box_1 at step 13.
- Constraint 2: I'm in front of blue_door_3 at step 1.
- Constraint 3: I'm in room_3 with purple_ball_1 at step 7.
- Constraint 4: I'm in front of yellow_box_1 at step 14.
- Constraint 5: I'm in room_1 at step 9.
- Constraint 6: I'm in front of grey_box_1 at step 12 and green_door_1 is unlocked at step 5.

Wait, there's an issue with the plan as outlined. In step 12, I'm supposed to be in front of grey_box_1 with green_door_1 unlocked. But by that point, I've gone back to room_2, and grey_box_1 is in room_2, but I'm not sure if I can verify that green_door_1 is unlocked from room_2. 

Let me think about this again. Constraint 6 says I need to be in front of grey_box_1 with green_door_1 unlocked. I unlock green_door_1 in step 5, but I need to be in front of grey_box_1 after that. Let me revise the plan:

1. Go in front of blue_door_3 in room_2 (satisfying constraint 2).
2. Toggle blue_door_3 to unlock it.
3. Go to room_4 through blue_door_3.
4. Toggle green_door_1 to unlock it (this is done in room_4).
5. Go in front of blue_ball_1.
6. Pick up blue_ball_1 (satisfying constraint 1, as I'm now holding an object).
7. Go to room_3 through green_door_1.
8. Go in front of yellow_ball_2.
9. Drop blue_ball_1 in room_3.
10. Toggle blue_door_2 to unlock it.
11. Go to room_1 through blue_door_2 (satisfying constraint 5).
12. Toggle blue_door_1 to unlock it.
13. Go to room_2 through blue_door_1.
14. Go in front of grey_box_1 (satisfying constraint 6, as green_door_1 is unlocked from step 4).
15. Go in front of yellow_box_1 (satisfying constraint 4).
16. Go in front of yellow_ball_1 (achieving the goal).

But wait, constraint 3 requires me to be in room_3 with purple_ball_1 also in room_3. However, in the initial state, purple_ball_1 is in room_4. I need to move it to room_3.

Let me revise the plan again:

1. Go in front of blue_door_3 in room_2 (satisfying constraint 2).
2. Toggle blue_door_3 to unlock it.
3. Go to room_4 through blue_door_3.
4. Go in front of purple_ball_1.
5. Pick up purple_ball_1 (satisfying constraint 1).
6. Toggle green_door_1 to unlock it.
7. Go to room_3 through green_door_1.
8. Drop purple_ball_1 in room_3 (satisfying constraint 3, as I'm in room_3 with purple_ball_1).
9. Toggle blue_door_2 to unlock it.
10. Go to room_1 through blue_door_2 (satisfying constraint 5).
11. Toggle blue_door_1 to unlock it.
12. Go to room_2 through blue_door_1.
13. Go in front of grey_box_1 (satisfying constraint 6, as green_door_1 is unlocked from step 6).
14. Go in front of yellow_box_1 (satisfying constraint 4).
15. Go in front of yellow_ball_1 (achieving the goal).

This plan should work. Let's break it down into the specific actions:

1. gotoobject blue_door_3 room_2 (Constraint 2 satisfied)
2. toggle blue_door_3
3. gotoroom room_2 room_4 blue_door_3
4. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4
5. pick purple_ball_1 room_4 (Constraint 1 satisfied)
6. gotoobject green_door_1 room_4
7. toggle green_door_1
8. gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1
9. drop purple_ball_1 room_3 (Constraint 3 satisfied)
10. gotoobject blue_door_2 room_3
11. toggle blue_door_2
12. gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_2 (Constraint 5 satisfied)
13. gotoobject blue_door_1 room_1
14. toggle blue_door_1
15. gotoroom room_1 room_2 blue_door_1
16. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_2 (Constraint 6 satisfied, as green_door_1 is unlocked)
17. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_2 (Constraint 4 satisfied)
18. gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2 (Goal achieved)

Wait, I think there's an issue with step 16 to step 17. After going in front of grey_box_1, I can't directly go in front of yellow_box_1 because I need to first use the gotoempty action and then go in front of yellow_box_1. Let me be more precise:

1. gotodoor blue_door_3 room_2 room_4 (Constraint 2 satisfied)
2. toggle blue_door_3
3. gotoroom room_2 room_4 blue_door_3
4. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4
5. pick purple_ball_1 room_4 (Constraint 1 satisfied)
6. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3
7. toggle green_door_1
8. gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1
9. drop purple_ball_1 room_3 (Constraint 3 satisfied)
10. gotodoor blue_door_2 room_3 room_1
11. toggle blue_door_2
12. gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_2 (Constraint 5 satisfied)
13. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2
14. toggle blue_door_1
15. gotoroom room_1 room_2 blue_door_1
16. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_2 (Constraint 6 satisfied, as green_door_1 is unlocked)
17. gotoempty
18. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_2 (Constraint 4 satisfied)
19. gotoempty
20. gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2 (Goal achieved)

Actually, let me reread the problem, especially focusing on constraint 6, which says: "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'The following conditions are all true: "you are in front of grey_box_1", "green_door_1 is not locked"'"

It's saying that both conditions must be true simultaneously at a given state. In my plan, I unlock green_door_1 in step 7, and I'm in front of grey_box_1 in step 16. These are different states, so it doesn't seem to satisfy the constraint. Let me think...

I need to pick up grey_box_1 from room_2, carry it to room_4, unlock green_door_1, and then be in front of grey_box_1 again. Let me revise the plan:

1. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_2
2. pick grey_box_1 room_2 (Constraint 1 satisfied)
3. gotodoor blue_door_3 room_2 room_4 (Constraint 2 satisfied)
4. toggle blue_door_3
5. gotoroom room_2 room_4 blue_door_3
6. gotoempty
7. drop grey_box_1 room_4 (Constraint 4 partially satisfied: grey_box_1 is in room_4)
8. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4
9. pick purple_ball_1 room_4
10. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3
11. toggle green_door_1
12. gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1
13. drop purple_ball_1 room_3 (Constraint 3 satisfied)
14. gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_1
15. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_4 (Constraint 6 satisfied: I'm in front of grey_box_1 and green_door_1 is unlocked)
16. pick grey_box_1 room_4
17. gotodoor blue_door_2 room_3 room_1 (wait, I'm in room_4, not room_3. This doesn't make sense)

Ok, let me try again. It seems like I'm having trouble keeping track of where everything is:

1. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_2
2. pick grey_box_1 room_2 (Constraint 1 satisfied)
3. gotodoor blue_door_3 room_2 room_4 (Constraint 2 satisfied)
4. toggle blue_door_3
5. gotoroom room_2 room_4 blue_door_3
6. gotoempty
7. drop grey_box_1 room_4 (Constraint 4 partially satisfied: grey_box_1 is in room_4)
8. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4
9. pick purple_ball_1 room_4
10. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3
11. toggle green_door_1
12. gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1
13. drop purple_ball_1 room_3 (Constraint 3 satisfied)
14. gotodoor blue_door_2 room_3 room_1
15. toggle blue_door_2
16. gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_2 (Constraint 5 satisfied)
17. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2
18. toggle blue_door_1
19. gotoroom room_1 room_2 blue_door_1
20. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_2 (Constraint 4 completely satisfied: I'm in front of yellow_box_1)
21. gotoempty
22. gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2 (Goal achieved)

Let's check if this plan meets all the constraints:

Constraint 1: "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'you are holding some object'"
- Satisfied in step 2 when I'm holding grey_box_1 and in step 9 when I'm holding purple_ball_1.

Constraint 2: "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'you are in front of blue_door_3'"
- Satisfied in step 3.

Constraint 3: "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'The following conditions are all true: "you are in room_3", "purple_ball_1 is in room_3"'"
- Satisfied in step 13 after dropping purple_ball_1 in room_3.

Constraint 4: "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'At least one of the following conditions is true: "you are in front of yellow_box_1", "grey_box_1 is in room_4"'"
- Satisfied in step 7 when grey_box_1 is in room_4 and in step 20 when I'm in front of yellow_box_1.

Constraint 5: "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'you are in room_1'"
- Satisfied in step 16 when I go to room_1.

Constraint 6: "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'The following conditions are all true: "you are in front of grey_box_1", "green_door_1 is not locked"'"
- This is not satisfied in the current plan. I drop grey_box_1 in room_4 and then leave it there. I never go back to it after unlocking green_door_1.

Let's revise the plan to satisfy this constraint. Actually, I think we need to go back to the drawing board a bit:

1. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_2
2. pick grey_box_1 room_2 (Constraint 1 satisfied)
3. gotodoor blue_door_3 room_2 room_4 (Constraint 2 satisfied)
4. toggle blue_door_3
5. gotoroom room_2 room_4 blue_door_3
6. gotoempty
7. drop grey_box_1 room_4 (Constraint 4 partially satisfied: grey_box_1 is in room_4)
8. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4
9. pick purple_ball_1 room_4
10. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3
11. toggle green_door_1
12. gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1
13. drop purple_ball_1 room_3 (Constraint 3 satisfied)
14. gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_1
15. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_4 (Constraint 6 satisfied: I'm in front of grey_box_1 and green_door_1 is unlocked)
16. gotodoor blue_door_3 room_4 room_2
17. gotoroom room_4 room_2 blue_door_3
18. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1
19. toggle blue_door_1
20. gotoroom room_2 room_1 blue_door_1 (Constraint 5 satisfied)
21. gotoroom room_1 room_2 blue_door_1
22. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_2 (Constraint 4 completely satisfied: I'm in front of yellow_box_1)
23. gotoempty
24. gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2 (Goal achieved)

Let me check this plan again:

Constraint 1: "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'you are holding some object'"
- Satisfied in step 2 when I'm holding grey_box_1 and in step 9 when I'm holding purple_ball_1.

Constraint 2: "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'you are in front of blue_door_3'"
- Satisfied in step 3.

Constraint 3: "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'The following conditions are all true: "you are in room_3", "purple_ball_1 is in room_3"'"
- Satisfied in step 13 after dropping purple_ball_1 in room_3.

Constraint 4: "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'At least one of the following conditions is true: "you are in front of yellow_box_1", "grey_box_1 is in room_4"'"
- Satisfied in step 7 when grey_box_1 is in room_4 and in step 22 when I'm in front of yellow_box_1.

Constraint 5: "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'you are in room_1'"
- Satisfied in step 20 when I go to room_1.

Constraint 6: "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'The following conditions are all true: "you are in front of grey_box_1", "green_door_1 is not locked"'"
- Satisfied in step 15 when I'm in front of grey_box_1 after unlocking green_door_1 in step 11.

I think the plan is correct now. Let me formalize the actions:

1. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_2
2. pick grey_box_1 room_2 (Constraint 1 satisfied)
3. gotodoor blue_door_3 room_2 room_4 (Constraint 2 satisfied)
4. toggle blue_door_3
5. gotoroom room_2 room_4 blue_door_3
6. gotoempty
7. drop grey_box_1 room_4 (Constraint 4 partially satisfied: grey_box_1 is in room_4)
8. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4
9. pick purple_ball_1 room_4
10. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3
11. toggle green_door_1
12. gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1
13. drop purple_ball_1 room_3 (Constraint 3 satisfied)
14. gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_1
15. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_4 (Constraint 6 satisfied: I'm in front of grey_box_1 and green_door_1 is unlocked)
16. gotodoor blue_door_3 room_4 room_2
17. gotoroom room_4 room_2 blue_door_3
18. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1
19. toggle blue_door_1
20. gotoroom room_2 room_1 blue_door_1 (Constraint 5 satisfied)
21. gotoroom room_1 room_2 blue_door_1
22. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_2 (Constraint 4 completely satisfied: I'm in front of yellow_box_1)
23. gotoempty
24. gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2 (Goal achieved)

Actually, re-checking this plan, there seem to be some issues still. For instance, in step 16, I go from "gotoobject grey_box_1 room_4" to "gotodoor blue_door_3 room_4 room_2". However, according to the rules, I can only go to a door if I'm not in front of an object. So, after step 15, I need to use the "gotoempty" action before going to the door. Let me fix these:

1. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_2
2. pick grey_box_1 room_2 (Constraint 1 satisfied)
3. gotodoor blue_door_3 room_2 room_4 (Constraint 2 satisfied)
4. toggle blue_door_3
5. gotoroom room_2 room_4 blue_door_3
6. gotoempty
7. drop grey_box_1 room_4 (Constraint 4 partially satisfied: grey_box_1 is in room_4)
8. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4
9. pick purple_ball_1 room_4
10. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3
11. toggle green_door_1
12. gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1
13. gotoempty
14. drop purple_ball_1 room_3 (Constraint 3 satisfied)
15. gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_1
16. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_4 (Constraint 6 satisfied: I'm in front of grey_box_1 and green_door_1 is unlocked)
17. gotoempty
18. gotodoor blue_door_3 room_4 room_2
19. gotoroom room_4 room_2 blue_door_3
20. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1
21. toggle blue_door_1
22. gotoroom room_2 room_1 blue_door_1 (Constraint 5 satisfied)
23. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2
24. gotoroom room_1 room_2 blue_door_1
25. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_2 (Constraint 4 completely satisfied: I'm in front of yellow_box_1)
26. gotoempty
27. gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2 (Goal achieved)

Actually, let me check the action "drop" more carefully. The rule says "you may only drop an object x if (i) you are currently holding x, and (ii) the position in front of you is empty." So after using "gotoempty", I'm in front of an empty position, so I should be able to drop the object. Ok, that works.

Also, the rule for "goto door" says "you may only go in front of a door d if (i) you are in a room which door d is connecting with another room, and (ii) there is no object blocking the position in front of d in the room you are currently in." It doesn't explicitly say I can't be in front of an object, but since objects can block doors, I think the "gotoempty" action is needed to make sure I'm not in front of an object that might block the door. Let me keep going with the cautious approach.

Now, let's check one more time if all constraints are satisfied:

Constraint 1: "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'you are holding some object'"
- Satisfied in step 2 when I'm holding grey_box_1 and in step 9 when I'm holding purple_ball_1.

Constraint 2: "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'you are in front of blue_door_3'"
- Satisfied in step 3.

Constraint 3: "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'The following conditions are all true: "you are in room_3", "purple_ball_1 is in room_3"'"
- Satisfied in step 14 after dropping purple_ball_1 in room_3.

Constraint 4: "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'At least one of the following conditions is true: "you are in front of yellow_box_1", "grey_box_1 is in room_4"'"
- Satisfied in step 7 when grey_box_1 is in room_4 and in step 25 when I'm in front of yellow_box_1.

Constraint 5: "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'you are in room_1'"
- Satisfied in step 22 when I go to room_1.

Constraint 6: "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'The following conditions are all true: "you are in front of grey_box_1", "green_door_1 is not locked"'"
- Satisfied in step 16 when I'm in front of grey_box_1 after unlocking green_door_1 in step 11.

I think the plan is now correct. Let me revisit the task as well, which is to end up in front of a yellow ball. In step 27, I go in front of yellow_ball_1, which achieves the goal.

Also, let me double-check the format of the actions to ensure they match the specified format in the problem.

1. "gotoobject x r": Go in front of to object x in room r.
   - In my plan, I use: gotoobject grey_box_1 room_2, which matches the format.

2. "gotoempty": Go in front of an empty position of the room, which does not contain any object.
   - In my plan, I use: gotoempty, which matches the format.

3. "gotodoor d r1 r2": Go in front of door d, connecting room r1 to room r2.
   - In my plan, I use: gotodoor blue_door_3 room_2 room_4, which matches the format.

4. "gotoroom r1 r2 d": Go to room r2 from room r1 using door d.
   - In my plan, I use: gotoroom room_2 room_4 blue_door_3, which matches the format.

5. "pick x r": Pick up object x in room r.
   - In my plan, I use: pick grey_box_1 room_2, which matches the format.

6. "drop x r": Drop object x in room r.
   - In my plan, I use: drop grey_box_1 room_4, which matches the format.

7. "toggle d": Unlock door d if is locked. Lock door d if is unlocked.
   - In my plan, I use: toggle blue_door_3, which matches the format.

Alright, I believe the plan is correct and all actions are correctly formatted. Here's the final plan:

1. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_2
2. pick grey_box_1 room_2
3. gotodoor blue_door_3 room_2 room_4
4. toggle blue_door_3
5. gotoroom room_2 room_4 blue_door_3
6. gotoempty
7. drop grey_box_1 room_4
8. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4
9. pick purple_ball_1 room_4
10. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3
11. toggle green_door_1
12. gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1
13. gotoempty
14. drop purple_ball_1 room_3
15. gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_1
16. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_4
17. gotoempty
18. gotodoor blue_door_3 room_4 room_2
19. gotoroom room_4 room_2 blue_door_3
20. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1
21. toggle blue_door_1
22. gotoroom room_2 room_1 blue_door_1
23. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2
24. gotoroom room_1 room_2 blue_door_1
25. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_2
26. gotoempty
27. gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2
