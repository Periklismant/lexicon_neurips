Okay, let's see. The goal is to get in front of a yellow ball. The initial state has me in room_2, and there are two yellow balls: yellow_ball_1 in room_2 and yellow_ball_2 in room_3. So I need to reach one of them. 

First, check if I can get to yellow_ball_1 directly. Since I'm already in room_2, maybe I can just go to it. But wait, what's the preconditions for "gotoobject"? I need to be in the same room as the object, which I am. But are there any objects blocking the path? The initial state doesn't mention any objects blocking doors, except when an object is in front of a door. Let me check the initial state again.

In the initial state, room_2 has yellow_ball_1, grey_box_1, yellow_box_1, grey_box_2. So the room has objects, but the problem says that "goto object x r" can be done if I'm in the same room as x. The action "gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2" should be possible. Then, after that, I need to be in front of it. Then the goal would be satisfied. But wait, the actions require that after going to the object, I'm in front of it. So maybe the plan is just "gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2". But wait, the initial state says that all doors are locked. So if I'm in room_2, can I just move to the object without any issues?

Wait, but the constraints might matter. Wait, the problem mentioned that the valid plan must abide by the constraints. Wait, the user mentioned constraints, but in the problem description, under "A valid plan for the abovementioned problem must abide by the following constraints:" but the user didn't list any constraints. Wait, maybe that's a formatting error. Let me check again.

Looking back, the original problem says: "A valid plan for the abovementioned problem must abide by the following constraints:" but there's nothing listed. Hmm, maybe a mistake in the input. But assuming there are no additional constraints beyond the preconditions, then the answer might be straightforward.

But let's think again. The initial doors are all locked. So if I need to go to another room, I have to unlock doors. But if the yellow_ball_1 is in room_2, where I already am, then maybe I can just go to it.

So the steps would be:

1. "gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2"

But wait, the preconditions for "gotoobject x r" require that I am in the same room as x. Since I'm in room_2 and yellow_ball_1 is in room_2, that's okay. Then, after performing that action, I would be in front of yellow_ball_1. That would satisfy the goal.

But wait, what about the doors being locked? Do I need to unlock any doors to move within the same room? No, because moving within the same room doesn't involve doors. The doors are for moving between rooms. So as long as I'm in the same room, I can go to the object.

But maybe there's a problem with objects blocking the position in front of the door. Wait, the initial state doesn't mention any objects blocking doors. The "blocking" is only checked when going to a door. The "goto door" action requires that there's no object blocking the position in front of d in the current room. But since I'm not trying to go to a door here, that's not an issue.

So the plan would be simply to go to the yellow_ball_1 in room_2. Therefore, the action is:

gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2

But let me check if there's any reason this wouldn't work. For example, is the agent already in front of an object? The initial state says "you are in room_2" but doesn't mention being in front of any object. So the first action would move the agent to be in front of yellow_ball_1. Then the goal is satisfied. So this is a one-step plan.

But maybe the problem is more complex. For example, perhaps the yellow_ball_1 is blocked by something. Wait, the problem states that the initial state has the objects in the rooms, but doesn't mention their positions relative to doors or each other. The "blocking" is only considered when trying to go to a door. So in room_2, if there's an object in front of another object, but since the agent can go to any object in the same room, maybe the "gotoobject" action is possible regardless. Unless the preconditions require that the path is clear, but the preconditions for "gotoobject" only require being in the same room as x. So the action is allowed.

Therefore, the optimal plan is just that one action.
