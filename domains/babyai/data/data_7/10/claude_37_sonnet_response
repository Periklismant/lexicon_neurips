Let's analyze the problem. We need to plan a sequence of actions to bring about the goal state where there is a grey door that you are in front of and that door is not locked.

In our gridworld, we have 4 rooms (room_1, room_2, room_3, room_4) arranged in a square. The doors connecting them are:
- grey_door_1 connects room_1 and room_2
- grey_door_2 connects room_1 and room_3
- green_door_1 connects room_2 and room_4
- red_door_1 connects room_3 and room_4

Initially:
- You are in room_4
- All doors are locked
- You are not holding any object

The goal is to have: "There is a door d such that "The following conditions are all true: "d is grey", "you are in front of d", "d is not locked"""

So, we need to unlock one of the grey doors (grey_door_1 or grey_door_2) and be in front of it.

There are several constraints we need to satisfy along the way:

1. We must be in room_4 at some point (already true at the start).
2. After being in room_4, at some point we must be holding an object and be in room_1.
3. We must unlock green_door_1 at some point.
4. After unlocking green_door_1, at some point we must be holding red_box_1 and red_door_1 must be unlocked.
5. Before being in front of green_door_1, we must be holding either yellow_box_1 or green_box_2.
6. Before being in room_2, we must be holding grey_box_1 and some object (which can be the same as grey_box_1).
7. Before being in front of grey_door_1, red_box_1 must be in room_3.
8. We must be holding some object at some point.
9. green_door_1 must be locked at some point.
10. After green_door_1 is locked, we must be holding some object.

Given these constraints, let me think about a plan.

Let's start from the initial state where we are in room_4, and work towards the goal of being in front of a grey door which is unlocked.

Initially, we're in room_4 and all doors connecting to it are locked (green_door_1 and red_door_1). We need to unlock one of them to leave room_4.

Constraint 3 says we need to unlock green_door_1 at some point. Let's unlock it right away.

1. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_4
2. pick yellow_box_1 room_4
3. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2
4. toggle green_door_1

Now green_door_1 is unlocked, and we're holding yellow_box_1. Constraint 4 says that after unlocking green_door_1, we need to be holding red_box_1 and red_door_1 must be unlocked. So, we should go to room_2, drop yellow_box_1, pick up red_box_1, then find a way to get to red_door_1 to unlock it.

However, constraint 6 says before we can be in room_2, we must be holding grey_box_1. But grey_box_1 is in room_3. So, we need to first get to room_3, pick up grey_box_1, then go to room_2.

But wait, room_3 is accessible only through room_1 via grey_door_2 or through room_4 via red_door_1, and both are locked. We need to find a way to unlock one of them.

Let's go back and rethink. In the initial state:
- We're in room_4
- yellow_box_1 is in room_4
- green_door_1 (to room_2) and red_door_1 (to room_3) are both locked

Constraint 5 says before being in front of green_door_1, we must be holding either yellow_box_1 or green_box_2. yellow_box_1 is in room_4, so we can pick it up.

1. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_4
2. pick yellow_box_1 room_4

Now we're holding yellow_box_1, so we can satisfy constraint 5 and go in front of green_door_1.

3. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2
4. toggle green_door_1

Now green_door_1 is unlocked. But constraint 6 says before being in room_2, we must be holding grey_box_1. grey_box_1 is in room_3, but to get to room_3, we need to go through locked doors. It seems like we have a circular dependency here.

Ah, it could be that we don't necessarily need to go to room_2 to achieve our goal. Our goal is to be in front of a grey door which is unlocked. Both grey doors are attached to room_1. So, we need to get to room_1 and unlock one of the grey doors.

But to get to room_1, we need to go through either room_2 or room_3. And before going to room_2, constraint 6 says we must be holding grey_box_1.

Actually, wait. Constraint 6 says "If expression 'you are in room_2' holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: 'The following conditions are all true: "you are holding grey_box_1", "you are holding some object"'". This is a bit confusing because we can only hold one object at a time. But I'm assuming it means that we must have been holding grey_box_1 at some point before we enter room_2.

Let's revise our plan. We need to:
1. Get grey_box_1 from room_3.
2. Go to room_2 (after having held grey_box_1).
3. Get to room_1 from room_2.
4. Unlock one of the grey doors.

To get to room_3 from room_4, we need to unlock red_door_1.

1. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_4
2. pick yellow_box_1 room_4
3. gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_3
4. toggle red_door_1
5. gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_1

Now we're in room_3, and we need to pick up grey_box_1.

6. gotoempty
7. drop yellow_box_1 room_3
8. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_3
9. pick grey_box_1 room_3

Now we're holding grey_box_1. We satisfied the condition for entering room_2.

10. gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_4
11. gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_1
12. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2
13. gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_1

Now we're in room_2. But wait, constraint 7 says before being in front of grey_door_1, red_box_1 must be in room_3. red_box_1 is initially in room_2. So, we need to move it to room_3.

But we're currently holding grey_box_1, so we need to drop it, pick up red_box_1, go to room_3, drop red_box_1, then come back to room_2, pick up grey_box_1 again, and then go to room_1.

This is getting quite involved, and I'm not sure if this is the most efficient way. Let me rethink.

Actually, constraint 7 says before being in front of grey_door_1, red_box_1 must be in room_3. grey_door_1 connects room_1 and room_2, so we can approach it from either room. If we approach it from room_1, we would be in room_1 and in front of grey_door_1. This would be valid as long as red_box_1 is in room_3 by then.

So, we need to:
1. Get red_box_1 from room_2.
2. Move it to room_3.
3. Then go to room_1 and be in front of grey_door_1.

Let's revise our plan:

1. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_4
2. pick yellow_box_1 room_4
3. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2
4. toggle green_door_1
5. gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_1
6. gotoempty
7. drop yellow_box_1 room_2
8. gotoobject red_box_1 room_2
9. pick red_box_1 room_2
10. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4
11. gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1
12. gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_3
13. toggle red_door_1
14. gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_1
15. gotoempty
16. drop red_box_1 room_3

Now red_box_1 is in room_3, satisfying constraint 7.

But wait, constraint 4 says after unlocking green_door_1, at some point we must be holding red_box_1 and red_door_1 must be unlocked. We've just accomplished that.

However, constraint 9 says green_door_1 must be locked at some point. Since we unlocked it earlier, we need to lock it again.

Also, constraint 2 says after being in room_4, at some point we must be holding an object and be in room_1. We've been in room_4, so we need to satisfy this by being in room_1 while holding an object.

Let's continue our plan:

17. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_3
18. pick grey_box_1 room_3

Now we're holding grey_box_1, which satisfies constraint 6 for when we enter room_2.

19. gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_4
20. gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_1
21. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2
22. toggle green_door_1

Now green_door_1 is locked again, satisfying constraint 9.

Constraint 10 says after green_door_1 is locked, we need to be holding an object. We're already holding grey_box_1, so this constraint is satisfied.

23. toggle green_door_1
24. gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_1
25. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_1
26. toggle grey_door_1
27. gotoroom room_2 room_1 grey_door_1

Now we're in room_1 and holding grey_box_1, which satisfies constraint 2.

We need to be in front of a grey door which is unlocked, which is our goal. grey_door_1 is now unlocked, so we need to be in front of it:

28. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2

Ah wait, I messed up the sequence. Let's back up a bit. To clarify:

If we're in room_2, we can approach grey_door_1 by moving to be in front of it from room_2. Similarly, if we're in room_1, we can approach it from room_1.

After step 27, we're in room_1, so we can approach grey_door_1 from room_1:

28. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2

Now we're in room_1, in front of grey_door_1, which is unlocked. This matches our goal: "There is a door d such that "The following conditions are all true: "d is grey", "you are in front of d", "d is not locked""

Actually, let's revisit the constraints once more to make sure we've satisfied all of them. We have seen that:

Constraint 1: We must be in room_4 at some point. 
- Satisfied. We start in room_4.

Constraint 2: After being in room_4, at some point we must be holding an object and be in room_1.
- Satisfied. In step 27, we are in room_1 and holding grey_box_1.

Constraint 3: We must unlock green_door_1 at some point.
- Satisfied. In step 4, we toggle green_door_1 to unlock it.

Constraint 4: After unlocking green_door_1, at some point we must be holding red_box_1 and red_door_1 must be unlocked.
- Satisfied. In steps 8-9, we pick up red_box_1, and in step 13, we toggle red_door_1 to unlock it.

Constraint 5: Before being in front of green_door_1, we must be holding either yellow_box_1 or green_box_2.
- Satisfied. Before step 3, we're holding yellow_box_1.

Constraint 6: Before being in room_2, we must be holding grey_box_1 and some object (which can be the same as grey_box_1).
- Satisfied. We hold grey_box_1 before entering room_2 in step 24.

Constraint 7: Before being in front of grey_door_1, red_box_1 must be in room_3.
- Satisfied. After step 16, red_box_1 is in room_3.

Constraint 8: We must be holding some object at some point.
- Satisfied. We hold yellow_box_1 at the beginning, then red_box_1, and finally grey_box_1.

Constraint 9: green_door_1 must be locked at some point.
- Satisfied. In step 22, we toggle green_door_1 to lock it.

Constraint 10: After green_door_1 is locked, we must be holding some object.
- Satisfied. After step 22, we're holding grey_box_1.

It seems like our plan should satisfy all the constraints. But wait, I just realized I made another mistake. In step 25, I noted "toggle grey_door_1" but grey_door_1 is initially locked. So, this toggle would make it unlocked, which is needed for our goal.

Let's make sure I've got the plan and constraints correct:

1. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_4
2. pick yellow_box_1 room_4
3. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2
4. toggle green_door_1 (green_door_1 becomes unlocked)
5. gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_1
6. gotoempty
7. drop yellow_box_1 room_2
8. gotoobject red_box_1 room_2
9. pick red_box_1 room_2
10. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4
11. gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1
12. gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_3
13. toggle red_door_1 (red_door_1 becomes unlocked)
14. gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_1
15. gotoempty
16. drop red_box_1 room_3
17. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_3
18. pick grey_box_1 room_3
19. gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_4
20. gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_1
21. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2
22. toggle green_door_1 (green_door_1 becomes locked)
23. toggle green_door_1 (green_door_1 becomes unlocked again)
24. gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_1
25. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_1
26. toggle grey_door_1 (grey_door_1 becomes unlocked)
27. gotoroom room_2 room_1 grey_door_1
28. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2

Let's double-check the constraints one more time. I need to make sure we're not missing anything.

Constraint 1: We must be in room_4 at some point. 
- Satisfied. We start in room_4.

Constraint 2: After being in room_4, at some point we must be holding an object and be in room_1.
- Satisfied. In step 27, we are in room_1 and holding grey_box_1.

Constraint 3: We must unlock green_door_1 at some point.
- Satisfied. In step 4, we toggle green_door_1 to unlock it.

Constraint 4: After unlocking green_door_1, at some point we must be holding red_box_1 and red_door_1 must be unlocked.
- Satisfied. In steps 8-9, we pick up red_box_1, and in step 13, we toggle red_door_1 to unlock it.

Constraint 5: Before being in front of green_door_1, we must be holding either yellow_box_1 or green_box_2.
- Satisfied. Before step 3, we're holding yellow_box_1.

Constraint 6: Before being in room_2, we must be holding grey_box_1 and some object (which can be the same as grey_box_1).
- Actually, I'm not sure if this is exactly satisfied. We're in room_2 twice: in steps 5 and 24. In step 5, we're not holding grey_box_1. In step 24, we are. Let me see if the constraint is specific.

Rereading Constraint 6: "If expression 'you are in room_2' holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: 'The following conditions are all true: "you are holding grey_box_1", "you are holding some object"'".

Actually, I think I misunderstood. This constraint says that before being in room_2, we must have been holding grey_box_1 at some point (not necessarily immediately before). However, before our first entry to room_2 in step 5, we haven't held grey_box_1 yet. So, we still don't satisfy this constraint. But I'm not even in room_2 yet. Let me check what that means.

Rereading the constraint: "If expression 'you are in room_2' holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: 'The following conditions are all true: "you are holding grey_box_1", "you are holding some object"'".

Actually, I think the constraint says that if we ever find ourselves in room_2, then at some earlier state, we must have been holding grey_box_1 (and some object, which is redundant since it's the same object). So, for the first entry to room_2 in step 5, we haven't satisfied this constraint because we haven't held grey_box_1 yet.

So, we need to pick up grey_box_1 before our first entry to room_2.

Let me revise our plan. We start in room_4 and need to get to grey_box_1, which is in room_3. To go from room_4 to room_3, we need to unlock red_door_1:

1. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_4
2. pick yellow_box_1 room_4
3. gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_3
4. toggle red_door_1 (red_door_1 becomes unlocked)
5. gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_1
6. gotoempty
7. drop yellow_box_1 room_3
8. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_3
9. pick grey_box_1 room_3
10. gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_4
11. gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_1
12. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2
13. toggle green_door_1 (green_door_1 becomes unlocked)
14. gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_1

Now we're in room_2, and we've previously held grey_box_1, so Constraint 6 is satisfied.

Constraint 7 says before being in front of grey_door_1, red_box_1 must be in room_3. red_box_1 is in room_2, so we need to move it to room_3.

15. gotoempty
16. drop grey_box_1 room_2
17. gotoobject red_box_1 room_2
18. pick red_box_1 room_2
19. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4
20. gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1
21. gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_3
22. gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_1
23. gotoempty
24. drop red_box_1 room_3

Now red_box_1 is in room_3, satisfying Constraint 7.

Constraint 4 says after unlocking green_door_1, at some point we must be holding red_box_1 and red_door_1 must be unlocked. We've satisfied this.

Constraint 9 says green_door_1 must be locked at some point. We need to lock it.

25. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_3
26. pick yellow_box_1 room_3
27. gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_4
28. gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_1
29. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2
30. toggle green_door_1 (green_door_1 becomes locked)

Now green_door_1 is locked, satisfying Constraint 9.

Constraint 10 says after green_door_1 is locked, we must be holding some object. We're currently holding yellow_box_1, so Constraint 10 is satisfied.

We now need to get to room_1 and be in front of grey_door_1 which should be unlocked. To get to room_1, we need to go through room_2. But green_door_1 is locked now. We'll unlock it and go to room_2.

31. toggle green_door_1 (green_door_1 becomes unlocked)
32. gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_1
33. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_2
34. gotoempty
35. drop yellow_box_1 room_2
36. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_2
37. pick grey_box_1 room_2
38. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_1
39. toggle grey_door_1 (grey_door_1 becomes unlocked)

Now grey_door_1 is unlocked.

40. gotoroom room_2 room_1 grey_door_1

Now we're in room_1 and holding grey_box_1, satisfying Constraint 2.

41. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2

Now we're in room_1, in front of grey_door_1, which is unlocked. This matches our goal.

Let's double-check all the constraints once more:

Constraint 1: We must be in room_4 at some point. 
- Satisfied. We start in room_4.

Constraint 2: After being in room_4, at some point we must be holding an object and be in room_1.
- Satisfied. In step 40, we are in room_1 and holding grey_box_1.

Constraint 3: We must unlock green_door_1 at some point.
- Satisfied. In step 13, we toggle green_door_1 to unlock it.

Constraint 4: After unlocking green_door_1, at some point we must be holding red_box_1 and red_door_1 must be unlocked.
- Satisfied. In steps 17-18, we pick up red_box_1, and in step 4, we toggle red_door_1 to unlock it.

Constraint 5: Before being in front of green_door_1, we must be holding either yellow_box_1 or green_box_2.
- Satisfied. Before step 12, we're holding grey_box_1. Actually, this doesn't satisfy the constraint because we're holding grey_box_1, not yellow_box_1 or green_box_2. But I can modify the plan: when we're in room_3, we can pick up green_box_2 instead of grey_box_1 initially, then go back to room_3 after dropping red_box_1, and pick up grey_box_1. Let me check if this works with the rest of the plan.

Actually, I think this constraint applies to each time we're in front of green_door_1, not just the first time. So, I need to revise the plan more carefully.

Thinking about the problem, I'm making it too complex. Let me break this down in a simpler, more direct way.

I think I misunderstood the constraint. The constraint says "Before being in front of green_door_1, we must be holding either yellow_box_1 or green_box_2." This means before any action where we're in front of green_door_1, we must have been holding either yellow_box_1 or green_box_2.

There are several times we go in front of green_door_1 in our plan: steps 3, 10, 12, 21, 29, 32.

Steps 3: We're holding yellow_box_1, so constraint 5 is satisfied.
Step 10: We're holding red_box_1, but the constraint was for being in front of green_door_1, not for going through it. But I still need to check if this is our first entry to being in front of green_door_1.
Step 12: We're holding yellow_box_1, so constraint 5 is satisfied.
Step 21: We're holding yellow_box_1, so constraint 5 is satisfied.
Step 29: We're holding yellow_box_1, so constraint 5 is satisfied.
Step 32: We're holding yellow_box_1, so constraint 5 is satisfied.

For all the times, I'm not sure if the constraint means "at some point before" or "immediately before" or "must still be holding". If it means "at some point before," then the constraint is satisfied for all these steps since we held yellow_box_1 at the beginning.

The wording is "Before being in front of green_door_1, we must be holding either yellow_box_1 or green_box_2", so I think it means at some point before, not that we must still be holding it when we're in front of the door.

Given all the complications and to simplify, let me rewrite the plan:

1. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_4
2. pick yellow_box_1 room_4
3. gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_3
4. toggle red_door_1 (now red_door_1 is unlocked)
5. gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_1
6. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_3
7. gotoempty
8. drop yellow_box_1 room_3
9. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_3
10. pick grey_box_1 room_3
11. gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_4
12. gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_1
13. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2
14. toggle green_door_1 (now green_door_1 is unlocked)
15. gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_1
16. gotoempty
17. drop grey_box_1 room_2
18. gotoobject red_box_1 room_2
19. pick red_box_1 room_2
20. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4
21. gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1
22. gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_3
23. gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_1
24. gotoempty
25. drop red_box_1 room_3 (now red_box_1 is in room_3, satisfying constraint 7)
26. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_3
27. pick yellow_box_1 room_3
28. gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_4
29. gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_1
30. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2
31. toggle green_door_1 (now green_door_1 is locked, satisfying constraint 9)
32. toggle green_door_1 (now green_door_1 is unlocked again)
33. gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_1
34. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_2
35. pick grey_box_1 room_2
36. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_1
37. toggle grey_door_1 (now grey_door_1 is unlocked)
38. gotoroom room_2 room_1 grey_door_1 (now we're in room_1 and holding grey_box_1, satisfying constraint 2)
39. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2 (now we're in front of grey_door_1, which is unlocked and grey, satisfying the goal)

We need to check constraints one more time to be sure. Let's see:

Constraint 1: We must be in room_4 at some point. 
- Satisfied. We start in room_4.

Constraint 2: After being in room_4, at some point we must be holding an object and be in room_1.
- Satisfied. In step 38, we are in room_1 and holding grey_box_1.

Constraint 3: We must unlock green_door_1 at some point.
- Satisfied. In step 14, we toggle green_door_1 to unlock it.

Constraint 4: After unlocking green_door_1, at some point we must be holding red_box_1 and red_door_1 must be unlocked.
- Satisfied. In steps 18-19, we pick up red_box_1, and red_door_1 is unlocked from step 4.

Constraint 5: Before being in front of green_door_1, we must be holding either yellow_box_1 or green_box_2.
- Satisfied for the first entry in step 13, as we had yellow_box_1 earlier. But I realize now that this constraint might apply to each time we're in front of green_door_1, not just the first. 

Actually, I think the constraint means that there was a state where we were holding either yellow_box_1 or green_box_2 before we are ever in front of green_door_1. Since we held yellow_box_1 in steps 1-8, this constraint is satisfied.

Constraint 6: Before being in room_2, we must be holding grey_box_1 and some object (which can be the same as grey_box_1).
- Satisfied. Before our first entry to room_2 in step 15, we held grey_box_1 in steps 10-16.

Constraint 7: Before being in front of grey_door_1, red_box_1 must be in room_3.
- Satisfied. After step 25, red_box_1 is in room_3, and we're in front of grey_door_1 in step 39.

Constraint 8: We must be holding some object at some point.
- Satisfied multiple times throughout the plan.

Constraint 9: green_door_1 must be locked at some point.
- Satisfied. In step 31, we toggle green_door_1 to lock it.

Constraint 10: After green_door_1 is locked, we must be holding some object.
- Satisfied. After step 31, we're holding yellow_box_1.

I think this plan satisfies all the constraints and achieves the goal. Let's simplify it:

1. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_4
2. pick yellow_box_1 room_4
3. gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_3
4. toggle red_door_1
5. gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_1
6. gotoempty
7. drop yellow_box_1 room_3
8. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_3
9. pick grey_box_1 room_3
10. gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_4
11. gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_1
12. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2
13. toggle green_door_1
14. gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_1
15. gotoempty
16. drop grey_box_1 room_2
17. gotoobject red_box_1 room_2
18. pick red_box_1 room_2
19. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4
20. gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1
21. gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_3
22. gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_1
23. gotoempty
24. drop red_box_1 room_3
25. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_3
26. pick yellow_box_1 room_3
27. gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_4
28. gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_1
29. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2
30. toggle green_door_1
31. toggle green_door_1
32. gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_1
33. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_2
34. pick grey_box_1 room_2
35. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_1
36. toggle grey_door_1
37. gotoroom room_2 room_1 grey_door_1
38. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2

Actually, I need to simplify and optimize the plan, since steps 30 and 31 are toggling the door twice, which is redundant. Let me rewrite once more:

1. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_4
2. pick yellow_box_1 room_4
3. gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_3
4. toggle red_door_1
5. gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_1
6. gotoempty
7. drop yellow_box_1 room_3
8. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_3
9. pick grey_box_1 room_3
10. gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_4
11. gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_1
12. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2
13. toggle green_door_1
14. gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_1
15. gotoempty
16. drop grey_box_1 room_2
17. gotoobject red_box_1 room_2
18. pick red_box_1 room_2
19. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4
20. gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1
21. gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_3
22. gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_1
23. gotoempty
24. drop red_box_1 room_3
25. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_3
26. pick yellow_box_1 room_3
27. gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_4
28. gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_1
29. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2
30. toggle green_door_1
31. toggle green_door_1
32. gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_1
33. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_2
34. pick grey_box_1 room_2
35. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_1
36. toggle grey_door_1
37. gotoroom room_2 room_1 grey_door_1
38. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2

But if I'm unlocking red_door_1 and then using it to get to room_3, I can immediately go to grey_box_1 and pick it up. Then I go to green_door_1 and unlock it, which means I've satisfied constraint 3. After, I need to satisfy constraint 4, which means I need to hold red_box_1 and red_door_1 needs to be unlocked. Well, red_door_1 is already unlocked. So, I need to go from room_3 to room_2 via room_4, drop grey_box_1, pick up red_box_1, then go back to room_3 (via room_4) and drop red_box_1. Now, I satisfy constraint 7 because red_box_1 is in room_3. Then, I need to pick up my yellow_box_1 again, go to room_4, and then toggle green_door_1 to lock it, satisfying constraint 9. After we lock green_door_1, we're holding yellow_box_1, so constraint 10 is satisfied. Then we unlock green_door_1 again, go to room_2, pick up grey_box_1, and go to room_1 via grey_door_1 after unlocking it. Now, we're in room_1 and holding grey_box_1, satisfying constraint 2. Finally, we go in front of grey_door_1, satisfying our goal.

Let's simplify one more time:

1. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_4
2. pick yellow_box_1 room_4
3. gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_3
4. toggle red_door_1
5. gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_1
6. gotoempty
7. drop yellow_box_1 room_3
8. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_3
9. pick grey_box_1 room_3
10. gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_4
11. gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_1
12. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2
13. toggle green_door_1
14. gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_1
15. gotoempty
16. drop grey_box_1 room_2
17. gotoobject red_box_1 room_2
18. pick red_box_1 room_2
19. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4
20. gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1
21. gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_3
22. gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_1
23. gotoempty
24. drop red_box_1 room_3
25. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_3
26. pick yellow_box_1 room_3
27. gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_4
28. gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_1
29. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2
30. toggle green_door_1
31. toggle green_door_1
32. gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_1
33. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_2
34. pick grey_box_1 room_2
35. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_1
36. toggle grey_door_1
37. gotoroom room_2 room_1 grey_door_1
38. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2

Is there a way to optimize this plan? Let's see:

In step 30, we're toggling green_door_1 to lock it, and in step 31, we're immediately unlocking it again. This is to satisfy constraint 9, but it seems wasteful. What if we skip these two steps and instead toggle green_door_1 to lock it in step 19 after we've gone through it, then unlock it again in step 29? This would save two steps and still satisfy all the constraints.

Let's rewrite once more with this optimization:

1. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_4
2. pick yellow_box_1 room_4
3. gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_3
4. toggle red_door_1
5. gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_1
6. gotoempty
7. drop yellow_box_1 room_3
8. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_3
9. pick grey_box_1 room_3
10. gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_4
11. gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_1
12. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2
13. toggle green_door_1
14. gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_1
15. gotoempty
16. drop grey_box_1 room_2
17. gotoobject red_box_1 room_2
18. pick red_box_1 room_2
19. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4
20. toggle green_door_1
21. gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1
22. gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_3
23. gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_1
24. gotoempty
25. drop red_box_1 room_3
26. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_3
27. pick yellow_box_1 room_3
28. gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_4
29. gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_1
30. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2
31. toggle green_door_1
32. gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_1
33. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_2
34. pick grey_box_1 room_2
35. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_1
36. toggle grey_door_1
37. gotoroom room_2 room_1 grey_door_1
38. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2

Ah, but actually in steps 19-20, we're toggling green_door_1 to lock it and then immediately going through it, which isn't possible if it's locked. So, my optimization doesn't work. Let's go back to the original plan and try again.

1. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_4
2. pick yellow_box_1 room_4
3. gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_3
4. toggle red_door_1
5. gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_1
6. gotoempty
7. drop yellow_box_1 room_3
8. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_3
9. pick grey_box_1 room_3
10. gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_4
11. gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_1
12. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2
13. toggle green_door_1
14. gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_1
15. gotoempty
16. drop grey_box_1 room_2
17. gotoobject red_box_1 room_2
18. pick red_box_1 room_2
19. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4
20. gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1
21. gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_3
22. gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_1
23. gotoempty
24. drop red_box_1 room_3
25. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_3
26. pick yellow_box_1 room_3
27. gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_4
28. gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_1
29. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2
30. toggle green_door_1
31. toggle green_door_1
32. gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_1
33. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_2
34. pick grey_box_1 room_2
35. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_1
36. toggle grey_door_1
37. gotoroom room_2 room_1 grey_door_1
38. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2

Actually, let me look into ways we can achieve the goal using grey_door_2 instead of grey_door_1. grey_door_2 connects room_1 and room_3. If we're in room_3, we can go directly to room_1 using grey_door_2 if it's unlocked.

Let's redo our plan with this in mind. From our initial state, we're in room_4. We'll need to go to room_3, then to room_1 via grey_door_2.

1. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_4
2. pick yellow_box_1 room_4
3. gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_3
4. toggle red_door_1
5. gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_1
6. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_3
7. gotoempty
8. drop yellow_box_1 room_3
9. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_3
10. pick grey_box_1 room_3
11. gotodoor grey_door_2 room_3 room_1
12. toggle grey_door_2
13. gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_2
14. gotodoor grey_door_2 room_1 room_3

Now we're in front of grey_door_2, which is a grey door that is unlocked. This matches our goal: "There is a door d such that "The following conditions are all true: "d is grey", "you are in front of d", "d is not locked""

Let's check if this plan satisfies all the constraints:

Constraint 1: We must be in room_4 at some point. 
- Satisfied. We start in room_4.

Constraint 2: After being in room_4, at some point we must be holding an object and be in room_1.
- Satisfied. In step 13, we are in room_1 and holding grey_box_1.

Constraint 3: We must unlock green_door_1 at some point.
- Not satisfied. We haven't unlocked green_door_1 in this plan.

So, this plan doesn't work for all the constraints. Let's go back to our original approach using grey_door_1.

Actually there's a better way I can lay out the plan. Let me consider each constraint and the goal, and then construct a simpler plan that satisfies all of them.

Goal: We need to be in front of a grey door that is unlocked. grey_door_1 and grey_door_2 are both grey doors, so we need to unlock one of them and be in front of it.

Constraint 1: We must be in room_4 at some point. This is true at the start, so it's satisfied.

Constraint 2: After being in room_4, we must be holding an object and be in room_1 at some point. This means we need to pick up an object and go to room_1 after we've been in room_4.

Constraint 3: We must unlock green_door_1 at some point. green_door_1 connects room_2 and room_4, so we need to go to one of these rooms and unlock green_door_1.

Constraint 4: After unlocking green_door_1, we must be holding red_box_1 and red_door_1 must be unlocked at some point. This means after we unlock green_door_1, we need to pick up red_box_1 (which is in room_2) and unlock red_door_1 (which connects room_3 and room_4).

Constraint 5: Before being in front of green_door_1, we must have been holding either yellow_box_1 or green_box_2. yellow_box_1 is in room_4, and green_box_2 is in room_3, so we need to pick up one of these before we're in front of green_door_1.

Constraint 6: Before being in room_2, we must have been holding grey_box_1. grey_box_1 is in room_3, so we need to go to room_3, pick up grey_box_1, then (potentially after some other steps) go to room_2.

Constraint 7: Before being in front of grey_door_1, red_box_1 must be in room_3. red_box_1 is in room_2, so we need to move it to room_3 before we're in front of grey_door_1.

Constraint 8: We must be holding some object at some point. This is easily satisfied by picking up any object.

Constraint 9: green_door_1 must be locked at some point. green_door_1 is initially locked, so this constraint is satisfied.

Constraint 10: After green_door_1 is locked, we must be holding some object at some point. Since green_door_1 is already locked, we need to be holding an object at some point after the start.

Now, let's construct a plan:

1. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_4
2. pick yellow_box_1 room_4
   - This satisfies constraint 8 (we're holding an object) and constraint 10 (we're holding an object after green_door_1 is locked).

3. gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_3
4. toggle red_door_1
5. gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_1
   - Now we're in room_3.

6. gotoempty
7. drop yellow_box_1 room_3
   - We need to drop yellow_box_1 to pick up grey_box_1.

8. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_3
9. pick grey_box_1 room_3
   - Now we're holding grey_box_1, which satisfies constraint 6 for when we'll later be in room_2.

10. gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_4
11. gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_1
    - We go back to room_4.

12. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2
    - We go in front of green_door_1. Constraint 5 is satisfied because we previously held yellow_box_1.

13. toggle green_door_1
    - We unlock green_door_1, satisfying constraint 3.

14. gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_1
    - We go to room_2. Constraint 6 is satisfied because we previously held grey_box_1.

15. gotoempty
16. drop grey_box_1 room_2
    - We drop grey_box_1 to pick up red_box_1.

17. gotoobject red_box_1 room_2
18. pick red_box_1 room_2
    - Now we're holding red_box_1. With this and red_door_1 being unlocked, constraint 4 is satisfied.

19. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4
20. gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1
    - We go back to room_4.

21. gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_3
22. gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_1
    - We go to room_3.

23. gotoempty
24. drop red_box_1 room_3
    - We drop red_box_1 in room_3, satisfying constraint 7 for when we'll later be in front of grey_door_1.

25. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_3
26. pick grey_box_1 room_3
    - Now we're holding grey_box_1.

27. gotodoor grey_door_2 room_3 room_1
28. toggle grey_door_2
    - We unlock grey_door_2.

29. gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_2
    - We go to room_1. With this and the fact that we're holding grey_box_1, constraint 2 is satisfied.

30. gotodoor grey_door_2 room_1 room_3
    - We're in front of grey_door_2, which is a grey door that is unlocked. This satisfies our goal.

Let me check if this plan satisfies all the constraints:

Constraint 1: We must be in room_4 at some point. 
- Satisfied. We start in room_4.

Constraint 2: After being in room_4, at some point we must be holding an object and be in room_1.
- Satisfied. In step 29, we are in room_1 and holding grey_box_1.

Constraint 3: We must unlock green_door_1 at some point.
- Satisfied. In step 13, we toggle green_door_1 to unlock it.

Constraint 4: After unlocking green_door_1, at some point we must be holding red_box_1 and red_door_1 must be unlocked.
- Satisfied. In steps 17-18, we pick up red_box_1, and red_door_1 is unlocked from step 4.

Constraint 5: Before being in front of green_door_1, we must be holding either yellow_box_1 or green_box_2.
- Satisfied. Before step 12, we held yellow_box_1 in steps 2-7.

Constraint 6: Before being in room_2, we must be holding grey_box_1 and some object.
- Satisfied. Before step 14, we held grey_box_1 in steps 9-16.

Constraint 7: Before being in front of grey_door_1, red_box_1 must be in room_3.
- Let's check if we ever go in front of grey_door_1. No, we don't. We use grey_door_2 instead. So, this constraint doesn't apply to our plan.

Actually, let's be careful here. We need to be in front of a grey door that is unlocked, and the goal didn't specify which grey door. I chose grey_door_2 in the plan, but if the constraint specifically mentions grey_door_1, I should consider it.

I'm reading the constraint again, and it says "Before being in front of grey_door_1, red_box_1 must be in room_3." This means if we ever go in front of grey_door_1, red_box_1 must be in room_3 before that. We're not planning to go in front of grey_door_1, so this constraint doesn't apply.

Constraint 8: We must be holding some object at some point.
- Satisfied multiple times throughout the plan.

Constraint 9: green_door_1 must be locked at some point.
- Satisfied. green_door_1 is initially locked.

Constraint 10: After green_door_1 is locked, we must be holding some object.
- Satisfied. green_door_1 is initially locked, and we pick up yellow_box_1 in step 2.

I think this plan satisfies all the constraints and achieves the goal. It's also more efficient than the previous plans.

Oh wait, I need to double check. It seems like I made an error in my plan. In steps 25-26, I'm trying to pick up grey_box_1 in room_3, but I've already picked it up and dropped it in room_2. If we need to pick up grey_box_1 in room_3, we should actually be picking yellow_box_1 again.

So, the updated plan is:

1. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_4
2. pick yellow_box_1 room_4
3. gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_3
4. toggle red_door_1
5. gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_1
6. gotoempty
7. drop yellow_box_1 room_3
8. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_3
9. pick grey_box_1 room_3
10. gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_4
11. gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_1
12. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2
13. toggle green_door_1
14. gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_1
15. gotoempty
16. drop grey_box_1 room_2
17. gotoobject red_box_1 room_2
18. pick red_box_1 room_2
19. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4
20. gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1
21. gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_3
22. gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_1
23. gotoempty
24. drop red_box_1 room_3
25. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_3
26. pick yellow_box_1 room_3
27. gotodoor grey_door_2 room_3 room_1
28. toggle grey_door_2
29. gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_2
30. gotodoor grey_door_2 room_1 room_3

Actually, wait. I think in my revised plan, I'm still satisfying all the constraints, but maybe not the goal. The goal is "There is a door d such that "The following conditions are all true: "d is grey", "you are in front of d", "d is not locked"""

In step 30, we're in front of grey_door_2, which is a grey door, and we've just toggled it to be unlocked in step 28. So, the goal is satisfied.

Actually, we can optimize this plan a bit further. In steps 1-2, we pick up yellow_box_1 in room_4, but we later pick up yellow_box_1 again in room_3. It should be the same box, so this is inconsistent. Let's correct that:

1. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_4
2. pick yellow_box_1 room_4
3. gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_3
4. toggle red_door_1
5. gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_1
6. gotoempty
7. drop yellow_box_1 room_3
8. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_3
9. pick grey_box_1 room_3
10. gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_4
11. gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_1
12. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2
13. toggle green_door_1
14. gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_1
15. gotoempty
16. drop grey_box_1 room_2
17. gotoobject red_box_1 room_2
18. pick red_box_1 room_2
19. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4
20. gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1
21. gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_3
22. gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_1
23. gotoempty
24. drop red_box_1 room_3
25. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_3
26. pick yellow_box_1 room_3
27. gotodoor grey_door_2 room_3 room_1
28. toggle grey_door_2
29. gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_2
30. gotodoor grey_door_2 room_1 room_3

I think this is correct, and it's a valid plan that satisfies all the constraints and achieves the goal.
