Okay, let's try to figure out how to solve this planning problem. The goal is to be in front of a grey door that's unlocked. The initial state has me in room_4, and all the doors are locked. The doors are grey_door_1 (connects room_1 and 2), grey_door_2 (connects room_1 and 3), green_door_1 (room_2 and 4), and red_door_1 (room_3 and 4). All are locked. The grey doors are the ones we need since the goal requires a grey door.

So, first, I need to unlock a grey door. But to toggle a door (unlock it), I have to be in front of it. But since all doors are locked, I can't go through them. Wait, but the problem is, how do I reach the grey doors? Because I'm in room_4 initially. The doors connected to room_4 are green_door_1 (room_2 and 4) and red_door_1 (room_3 and 4). Both are locked. So I can't exit room_4 through those doors unless I unlock them. But the goal is to have a grey door unlocked and be in front of it. The grey doors are grey_door_1 (room_1-2) and grey_door_2 (room_1-3). So they are not adjacent to room_4. To get to them, I need to go through other rooms, but all doors are locked. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I can unlock one of the doors in room_4 first. But the grey doors aren't in room_4. So perhaps I need to unlock the green or red door in room_4 to leave room_4, then go to the rooms where the grey doors are. Let's see.

First, the green_door_1 connects room_2 and 4. So if I can unlock that door from room_4, then I can go to room_2. But to toggle the door, I need to be in front of it. To get in front of green_door_1 in room_4, I need to go to it. But wait, the "goto door" action's precondition is that I'm in a room connected by that door, and there's no object blocking the position in front of the door. So in room_4, green_door_1 connects to room_2. So I can perform "gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2" if there's nothing blocking it. Are there any objects blocking the door in room_4? Let's check the initial state. In room_4, there's yellow_box_1. But the initial state doesn't mention any objects blocking doors. Wait, the problem says that "the position in front of d in the room you are currently in" must not be blocked. So if there's an object in front of the door, then "goto door" is blocked. But how do we know if an object is blocking a door?

Looking at the initial state, objects are in rooms. For example, yellow_box_1 is in room_4. But unless the problem states that an object is blocking a door, we can assume they aren't. The initial state doesn't mention any doors being blocked, so maybe all doors are unblocked. Therefore, I can go to green_door_1 from room_4. Then, toggle it to unlock it. Then, go through to room_2. Then, from room_2, maybe proceed towards room_1 via grey_door_1, which is locked. But that's a grey door. So perhaps I need to get to grey_door_1, unlock it, and then be in front of it.

Wait, but the goal is to have a grey door that's unlocked and be in front of it. So once I unlock a grey door and are in front of it, that's the goal. Let's think.

But starting in room_4, all doors are locked. So first step: unlock green_door_1 (which is green) to get out of room_4. Let's see:

1. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2. Since I'm in room_4, which is connected via green_door_1 to room_2, and no object is blocking it (since the initial state doesn't mention any blocking), so this is possible.

2. toggle green_door_1. This will unlock it.

3. gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_1. Now I'm in room_2.

From room_2, the doors are grey_door_1 (connects to room_1) and green_door_1 (connects to room_4). Now, in room_2, there's red_box_1 and grey_ball_2. So next, maybe go to grey_door_1. But grey_door_1 is locked. So need to unlock it. But to unlock it, I need to be in front of it.

So steps from room_2:

4. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_1. Possible if no object is blocking. Since room_2 has red_box_1 and grey_ball_2, but unless they are in front of the door, it's okay. Assuming they are not, so possible.

5. toggle grey_door_1. Now it's unlocked.

6. Now, I'm in front of grey_door_1 in room_2. The goal is to be in front of a grey door that's unlocked. So this would satisfy the goal: grey_door_1 is grey, unlocked, and I'm in front of it. So the plan would be steps 1-5, but let's check.

Wait, but after step 3, when I go to room_2, the action "gotoroom" makes me no longer in front of any object. So after step 3, I'm in room_2 but not in front of anything. Then step 4 is going to the door grey_door_1 in room_2. Then step 5, toggle it to unlock. Then the state would have me in front of grey_door_1, which is now unlocked. That meets the goal.

So the plan would be:

goto door green_door_1 room_4 room_2

toggle green_door_1

goto room_4 room_2 green_door_1

goto door grey_door_1 room_2 room_1

toggle grey_door_1

Wait, but after the third action, the agent is in room_2, not in front of anything. Then, the fourth action is gotodoor grey_door_1 in room_2. Then toggle it. Then, after that, the agent is in front of the grey door (grey_door_1) which is now unlocked. So that satisfies the goal.

But let's check each action's preconditions:

1. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2: yes, agent is in room_4, which is connected via green_door_1. No blocking object.

2. toggle green_door_1: must be in front of it. After step 1, the agent is in front of green_door_1. So yes.

3. gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_1: preconditions are that the door is unlocked (since we just toggled it, it was locked, now it's unlocked. Wait, toggle action's effect is: if locked, unlock; if unlocked, lock. So initial state: green_door_1 is locked. Step 2: toggle green_door_1, so now it's unlocked. Then step 3: using green_door_1 to go from room_4 to room_2. But wait, after step 1, the agent is in front of green_door_1 in room_4. Then step 2 toggles it (unlocking). Then step 3 is gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_1. Preconditions: in room_4 (yes), adjacent to room_2 (yes via green_door_1), and door is unlocked (yes). So that's okay.

After step 3, agent is in room_2, not in front of anything.

Step 4: gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_1. Agent is in room_2, which is connected via grey_door_1 to room_1. Assuming no blocking. Then step 4 is possible.

Step 5: toggle grey_door_1. Now, since grey_door_1 was initially locked, toggling it will unlock it. Now, agent is in front of a grey door (grey_door_1 is grey) which is now unlocked. So the goal is achieved.

So the plan would be:

```
gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2
toggle green_door_1
gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_1
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_1
toggle grey_door_1
```

But let me check if there's a shorter path. Let's see.

Alternative: Maybe using the red_door_1 from room_4 to room_3. But red_door_1 is locked. So same process: goto door red_door_1 in room_4, toggle to unlock, then go to room_3, then go to grey_door_2 (which connects room_1 and 3). But that would take similar steps.

Compare the two options:

Option 1: Green door to room_2, then grey_door_1.

Option 2: Red door to room_3, then grey_door_2.

Which is shorter? Both require unlocking a door, moving to the next room, then unlocking a grey door. Both are 5 steps. But maybe there's a better way.

Wait, the goal is to be in front of any grey door that's unlocked. So perhaps, if after unlocking the green_door_1 and moving to room_2, can I unlock grey_door_1 from room_2's side?

Yes. So the steps as before. So the plan length is 5 actions. Is that optimal?

Is there a way to do it in fewer steps? Let's see.

Alternative approach: If there's a box that can be moved to unblock a door, but the initial problem states that objects are in certain rooms. But the problem doesn't mention any doors being blocked by objects. So perhaps all doors are unblocked. So the initial plan is possible.

Another thought: Do I need to pick up or drop any objects? The goal doesn't require moving objects, so maybe not. So the plan I outlined earlier seems valid.

So the final plan would be those five steps. Let me double-check each action's preconditions and effects.

1. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2: Agent is in room_4, which is connected via green_door_1. Precondition met. Effect: now in front of green_door_1.

2. toggle green_door_1: Agent is in front of it. Toggles from locked to unlocked. Now green_door_1 is unlocked.

3. gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_1: Door is unlocked, so allowed. Moves to room_2. Now in room_2, not in front of anything.

4. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_1: Agent is in room_2, connected via grey_door_1. Precondition met.

5. toggle grey_door_1: Unlocks it. Now agent is in front of grey_door_1, which is unlocked. Goal achieved.

Yes, that works. So this plan is valid and optimal with 5 steps. I don't think there's a shorter path since each door unlock requires two actions (goto door and toggle), and moving between rooms takes another action. So this seems minimal.
