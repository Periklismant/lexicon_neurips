Okay, let's tackle this planning problem step by step. The goal is to have a grey door that's unlocked and be in front of it. The initial state has all doors locked, and the agent starts in room_4. There are a bunch of constraints to satisfy, so I need to make sure each one is addressed in the plan.

First, let's list out all the constraints and see how they might interact. 

The main goal is to have a grey door (either grey_door_1 or grey_door_2) that's unlocked and be in front of it. So the plan must end with the agent in front of either grey_door_1 or grey_door_2 after unlocking it. But all doors start locked, so we need to unlock at least one of them.

Now, the constraints:

1. The agent must be in room_4 at least once. Well, the initial state already satisfies this since they start there. But the constraint says "in at least one state," which is already true. However, there's another part: if they are in room_4 in some state, then they must be holding something and in room_1 either at that state or later. So after being in room_4 (which they are initially), they need to eventually hold an object and be in room_1. So the plan must include a step where they are in room_1 holding something after the initial state.

2. The green_door_1 must be unlocked at some point. And when that happens, the agent must later hold red_box_1 and have red_door_1 unlocked. So we need to unlock green_door_1, which connects room_2 and room_4. But green_door_1 starts locked. To unlock it, the agent must be in front of it and toggle it. However, to get in front of green_door_1, the agent needs to be in room_2 or room_4 and have the path clear. But since the agent is in room_4 initially, they might need to go to room_2 via green_door_1, but that door is locked. Wait, no, green_door_1 connects room_2 and room_4. So the agent is in room_4, so to go to room_2 via green_door_1, the door needs to be unlocked. But it's locked. So maybe they need to unlock green_door_1 first. But to do that, they need to be in front of it. So in room_4, they can go to green_door_1 (if not blocked), then toggle it to unlock. But wait, the preconditions for gotodoor: the agent must be in a room connected by the door, and there's no object blocking the position in front of the door. Are there any objects blocking doors in room_4? Let's check the initial state: room_4 has yellow_box_1. If yellow_box_1 is blocking the door, then the agent can't go to the door. But the problem statement says "the position in front of d in the room you are currently in" must not be blocked. So if in room_4, the green_door_1 is connected to room_2. So in room_4, the position in front of green_door_1 is blocked by any object? The objects in room_4 are yellow_box_1. But unless the yellow_box_1 is in front of the door, it's not blocking. The initial positions aren't specified beyond the room. So perhaps the assumption is that objects are not blocking doors unless stated. Wait, the problem mentions that "if x was blocking some door, then it is no longer blocking that door" when picked up. So in the initial state, are any objects blocking doors? The original state doesn't mention any blocking, so maybe doors are not blocked initially. So the agent can go to green_door_1 from room_4. So the steps would be: gotoempty in room_4 (to get in front of nothing), then gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2. Wait, no: gotodoor d r1 r2 requires that you are in a room connected by d. Since the agent is in room_4, which is connected to room_2 via green_door_1, they can go to the door. Then toggle it to unlock. But green_door_1 starts locked. So after toggling, it becomes unlocked. That would satisfy the constraint that green_door_1 is not locked in some state. Then, after that, the agent must hold red_box_1 and red_door_1 must be unlocked. So red_door_1 connects room_3 and room_4. So to unlock red_door_1, the agent needs to be in front of it and toggle it. But red_door_1 is in room_4 and room_3. So the agent is in room_4, can go to red_door_1, toggle it. But they need to do that after unlocking green_door_1. Also, they need to pick up red_box_1, which is in room_2. So after unlocking green_door_1, they can go to room_2 via green_door_1 (since it's now unlocked), pick up red_box_1, then maybe go back to room_4 and unlock red_door_1. But how to get to room_2 from room_4? After unlocking green_door_1, the agent can use gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_1. Then in room_2, they can pick up red_box_1. Then maybe go back to room_4, unlock red_door_1. But this seems like a possible path.

Another constraint: when the agent is in front of green_door_1, they must have previously held yellow_box_1 or green_box_2. So before any state where they are in front of green_door_1, they must have held either of those. So the first time they go to green_door_1, they need to have held one of those boxes. Wait, but initially, they are in room_4. If they go to green_door_1 from room_4, that's their first action. But they haven't held anything yet. So that would violate the constraint. Therefore, they need to first pick up either yellow_box_1 (in room_4) or green_box_2 (in room_3) before going to green_door_1. But how?

Wait, the initial state has yellow_box_1 in room_4. So the agent is in room_4. They can gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_4, then pick it up. Then drop it somewhere else? But why? Because the constraint says that if they are in front of green_door_1 in any state, there must be an earlier state where they were holding yellow_box_1 or green_box_2. So, for example, if they first pick up yellow_box_1, then drop it, then later go to green_door_1, that would satisfy the constraint because they held it earlier. So the plan would include picking up yellow_box_1, then dropping it, then proceeding to green_door_1. But why would they need to drop it? Maybe they need to carry it to another room, but maybe not. Alternatively, they could just pick it up and hold it when they go to green_door_1. But the action to go to the door requires that they are in the same room as the door. So if they are holding yellow_box_1, can they still go to the door? Yes, as long as they are in the same room. So perhaps:

1. In room_4: gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_4
2. pick yellow_box_1 room_4
3. Now holding it. Then gotoempty (to get in front of nothing)
4. Then gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2 (since now in room_4, and the door is there)
5. toggle green_door_1 (unlocking it)
6. Then, they have to go to room_2 via green_door_1, pick up red_box_1, then go to room_4 again, unlock red_door_1, etc.

But this way, when they are in front of green_door_1 (step 4), they have already held yellow_box_1 (step 2), which satisfies the constraint.

Another constraint: when in room_2, they must have previously held grey_box_1 while holding some object. So grey_box_1 is in room_3. So the agent needs to have held grey_box_1 before entering room_2. So perhaps after unlocking green_door_1, they go to room_2, but that's not possible yet because the constraint says that when they are in room_2, they must have previously held grey_box_1. So how can they get grey_box_1? It's in room_3. To get to room_3 from room_4, they can use red_door_1, but that's locked. So first, they need to unlock red_door_1. But red_door_1 is locked. To unlock it, they need to be in front of it. So from room_4, gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_3, then toggle it. But that requires that the door is not blocked. Since room_4 has yellow_box_1, but if the agent is in room_4, and the door's position is not blocked, they can go there. So steps:

After initial steps of picking yellow_box_1 and dropping it, maybe:

But wait, let's outline the steps more clearly.

Initial state: in room_4, not holding anything. All doors locked.

Constraints:

- Must be in room_4 at least once (already satisfied).
- If in room_4 (which they are initially), then at some point after, they must hold something and be in room_1. So they need to eventually reach room_1 while holding something.
- green_door_1 must be unlocked at some point. When that happens, later they must hold red_box_1 and red_door_1 must be unlocked.
- When in front of green_door_1, must have previously held yellow_box_1 or green_box_2.
- When in room_2, must have previously held grey_box_1 while holding something.
- When in front of grey_door_1, must have previously had red_box_1 in room_3.
- Must hold some object at some point.
- green_door_1 must be locked at some point. If it's locked, then the agent must hold something at that time or later.

So the plan must include:

1. Unlock green_door_1, which requires being in front of it. To get there, the agent might need to pick up yellow_box_1 first to satisfy the constraint when they go to green_door_1.

But let's start building the plan step by step.

Starting in room_4. Need to eventually get to a grey unlocked door in front.

First, perhaps the agent needs to unlock green_door_1 and red_door_1, but the main goal is a grey door. The grey doors are grey_door_1 (connecting room_1 and room_2) and grey_door_2 (connecting room_1 and room_3). Both are locked initially.

To unlock a grey door, the agent needs to be in front of it. So they need to reach either room_1, room_2, or room_3. But initially, they are in room_4. So how to get to room_1?

The connections are:

room_1 connected to room_2 via grey_door_1

room_1 connected to room_3 via grey_door_2

room_2 connected to room_4 via green_door_1

room_3 connected to room_4 via red_door_1

So from room_4, the agent can go to room_2 via green_door_1 (once unlocked) or to room_3 via red_door_1 (once unlocked).

But both green_door_1 and red_door_1 are locked. So the agent needs to unlock them first.

But to unlock them, the agent needs to be in front of them. So from room_4, the agent can go to green_door_1 and red_door_1, provided their positions are not blocked.

Assuming that in room_4, the doors are accessible (no blocking objects), the steps could be:

1. gotoempty (room_4) to get in front of an empty spot.

But maybe not necessary. Let's see:

First, the agent is in room_4. They need to go to green_door_1. To do that, gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2. But the preconditions are that they are in a room connected by the door (they are in room_4, which is connected via green_door_1 to room_2) and that there's no object blocking the position in front of the door in their current room (room_4). Since room_4 has yellow_box_1, but unless it's blocking the door, which isn't stated, the agent can go to the door. So:

Action: gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2

But wait, the constraint says that when they are in front of green_door_1, they must have previously held yellow_box_1 or green_box_2. So before this action, they need to have held one of those. So they need to first pick up yellow_box_1 (in room_4) before going to green_door_1.

So steps:

1. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_4 (since they are in room_4)
2. pick yellow_box_1 room_4 (now holding it)
3. drop yellow_box_1 room_4 (to free hands, but why? Or maybe they can carry it to the door)
Wait, but after dropping, they are in front of it. Then, they can gotoempty, then goto the door. But perhaps it's better to carry it while going to the door. Let's see:

After picking up yellow_box_1, they can then go to the door. But the action to go to the door (gotodoor) requires that they are in the same room as the door (they are), and that there's no object blocking. Since they are holding yellow_box_1, does that affect the door's accessibility? No, because they are carrying it, so it's not blocking the door. So:

1. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_4
2. pick yellow_box_1 room_4
3. Now holding it. Then, gotoempty (room_4) to move away from the object.
Wait, but after picking, they are no longer in front of the object. The effect of pick is that they are no longer in front of x. So after picking, they are just in the room, not in front of anything. So to go to the door, they can directly do gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2.

But the constraint is satisfied because they held yellow_box_1 in step 2. So step 3 would be:

3. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2
4. toggle green_door_1 (unlocking it)

Now, green_door_1 is unlocked. This satisfies the constraint that green_door_1 is not locked at some state. Then, according to the next constraint, after unlocking green_door_1, the agent must hold red_box_1 and red_door_1 must be unlocked. So after this, they need to go to room_2, pick up red_box_1, and unlock red_door_1.

But first, the agent is in front of green_door_1 in room_4. They can use gotoroom to go to room_2:

5. gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_1

Now in room_2. But the constraint says that when in room_2, the agent must have previously held grey_box_1 while holding something. So before entering room_2, they need to have held grey_box_1. But grey_box_1 is in room_3. How can they get it?

This is a problem. Because to get to room_3, they need to go through red_door_1 from room_4 or grey_door_2 from room_1. But red_door_1 is locked. So the agent needs to unlock red_door_1 first. But they are currently in room_2. To unlock red_door_1, they need to be in front of it in room_4 or room_3. But from room_2, they can't directly get to room_3 unless via room_1 and grey_door_2, but those are locked.

Alternatively, after unlocking green_door_1 and being in room_2, maybe the agent can unlock red_door_1 from room_4. But how? To unlock red_door_1, they need to be in front of it. So they need to go back to room_4, unlock red_door_1, then go to room_3 via red_door_1, get grey_box_1, then go back to room_2. But this seems complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the agent needs to first unlock red_door_1 before going to room_2. Let's think.

The agent is in room_4. They need to unlock red_door_1. To do that:

goto red_door_1 (room_4 to room_3), toggle it. But red_door_1 is locked. So:

But wait, the agent is in room_4. To unlock red_door_1, they need to be in front of it. So:

After initial steps:

1. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_4
2. pick yellow_box_1 room_4
3. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2
4. toggle green_door_1 (now unlocked)
5. Now, they need to go to room_2, but that requires using gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_1. But before entering room_2, they need to have held grey_box_1. Which is not possible yet. So perhaps they need to first unlock red_door_1 and get grey_box_1.

So perhaps after step 4, instead of going to room_2, they go to red_door_1:

5. gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_3
6. toggle red_door_1 (unlocks it)
7. gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_1 (now in room_3)
8. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_3
9. pick grey_box_1 room_3 (now holding it)
10. Then, need to go back to room_4 via red_door_1 (which is now unlocked)
11. gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_1 (now in room_4)
12. Now, to go to room_2 via green_door_1 (which is unlocked), they can:
    gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_1 (now in room_2)
    But now, when they enter room_2, the constraint is satisfied because they previously held grey_box_1 (step 9).

But they need to have held grey_box_1 while holding some object. Since they were holding it, that's satisfied.

Then, in room_2, they can pick up red_box_1:

13. gotoobject red_box_1 room_2
14. pick red_box_1 room_2 (but they are already holding grey_box_1. Wait, can't pick up another object. Oh right, the agent can only hold one object at a time. So they need to drop grey_box_1 first.

Wait, this complicates things. Because to pick up red_box_1 in room_2, the agent must not be holding anything. So steps after entering room_2:

12. gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_1 (now in room_2)
13. drop grey_box_1 room_2 (but they need to be in front of an empty position to drop. So:
    gotoempty (room_2)
    drop grey_box_1 room_2
14. Now, not holding anything. Then gotoobject red_box_1 room_2
15. pick red_box_1 room_2

But now, they have to unlock red_door_1. Wait, no. The constraint after green_door_1 is unlocked (step 4) requires that the agent holds red_box_1 and red_door_1 is not locked. So after step 4, which is toggling green_door_1, the agent must later hold red_box_1 and have red_door_1 unlocked. So step 6 already unlocked red_door_1. So when the agent toggled red_door_1 in step 6, it became unlocked, satisfying that part. Then, when they pick up red_box_1 in step 15, that's the holding part. So that satisfies the constraint.

Now, the agent is holding red_box_1. Then, they need to go back to room_4 to unlock red_door_1 again if needed, but it's already unlocked. Wait, no: the constraint is that after green_door_1 is unlocked (step 4), the agent must hold red_box_1 and red_door_1 must be unlocked. So step 4 is the unlocking of green_door_1. Then, step 6 unlocks red_door_1, and step 15 picks up red_box_1. So as long as these happen after step 4, the constraint is satisfied. So that's okay.

Now, the agent is in room_2, holding red_box_1. Next, they need to go to room_1 to unlock one of the grey doors. But how? From room_2, they can go to room_1 via grey_door_1, but it's locked. So they need to unlock grey_door_1. To do that, they need to be in front of it. So they need to go to room_1 or room_2 and be in front of grey_door_1. But grey_door_1 is between room_1 and room_2.

But the agent is in room_2. So they can goto grey_door_1 in room_2. But to do that, they need to be in room_2. So:

16. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_1 (precondition: in room connected by door, which they are)
17. toggle grey_door_1 (unlock it)

But wait, the constraint says that when they are in front of grey_door_1, there must be an earlier state where red_box_1 is in room_3. But red_box_1 is initially in room_2. The agent picked it up in room_2. So unless they drop it in room_3, this constraint isn't met. So this is a problem.

The constraint: if the agent is in front of grey_door_1 in some state, then there must be an earlier state where red_box_1 is in room_3. So before the agent can go to grey_door_1 (steps 16 and 17), red_box_1 must have been in room_3 at some point. But red_box_1 starts in room_2. The agent picked it up in room_2. To have it in room_3, they need to carry it there. So after picking it up in room_2, they need to take it to room_3. But how? From room_2, they can go to room_4 via green_door_1 (unlocked), then to room_3 via red_door_1 (unlocked). So:

After step 15 (holding red_box_1 in room_2):

16. gotoempty (room_2)
17. drop red_box_1 room_2 (but that would leave it in room_2 again. Not helpful.)

Alternatively, take red_box_1 to room_3:

15. (holding red_box_1 in room_2)
16. gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1 (back to room_4)
17. gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_3 (already unlocked)
18. gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_1 (now in room_3)
19. drop red_box_1 room_3 (now red_box_1 is in room_3)
20. Now, they can go back to room_2 via room_4, pick up red_box_1 again, but this seems inefficient.

But this way, at step 19, red_box_1 is in room_3, satisfying the constraint that before being in front of grey_door_1, red_box_1 was in room_3. Then, the agent can proceed to go to room_1 via grey_door_2 or grey_door_1, but this seems complicated.

Alternatively, after dropping red_box_1 in room_3, the agent can go to room_1 via grey_door_2 (connecting room_1 and room_3). But grey_door_2 is locked. So need to unlock it. To unlock grey_door_2, they need to be in front of it in room_1 or room_3.

If the agent is in room_3, they can goto grey_door_2 (connecting to room_1), toggle it to unlock. Then go to room_1 via grey_door_2. But then, in room_1, they can goto grey_door_1 and unlock it as well.

But this is getting complicated. Let's try to outline the steps again:

Initial steps:

1. Pick up yellow_box_1 in room_4 to satisfy the constraint when later going to green_door_1.
2. Go to green_door_1 in room_4 and unlock it.
3. Go to red_door_1 in room_4 and unlock it.
4. Go to room_3 via red_door_1, pick up grey_box_1.
5. Return to room_4, then go to room_2 via green_door_1.
6. Drop grey_box_1 in room_2 to satisfy the constraint when entering room_2.
7. Pick up red_box_1 in room_2.
8. Take red_box_1 to room_3 via room_4 and red_door_1.
9. Drop red_box_1 in room_3 to satisfy the grey_door_1 front constraint.
10. Now, go to grey_door_2 in room_3, unlock it.
11. Go to room_1 via grey_door_2.
12. Unlock grey_door_1 from room_1.
13. Go to room_2 via grey_door_1.
14. Go to grey_door_1 in room_2 (already unlocked), and be in front of it to satisfy the goal.

Wait, but the goal is to have a grey door (d) that is unlocked and be in front of it. So either grey_door_1 or grey_door_2. Once unlocked, the agent can be in front of it.

Alternatively, after unlocking grey_door_2 in step 10, the agent can go to room_1 and be in front of grey_door_2, which is grey and unlocked. But they need to be in front of it. So steps:

After step 10:

10. In room_3, toggle grey_door_2 (unlock it)
11. gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_2 (now in room_1)
12. gotodoor grey_door_2 room_1 room_3 (to be in front of it)
13. Now, grey_door_2 is grey and unlocked. The agent is in front of it. This satisfies the goal.

But the constraints also require that the agent must be in room_1 while holding something. Because when they were in room_4 (initially), they must eventually be in room_1 holding something. So when they are in room_1 (step 11), they need to be holding an object. But at step 11, they are not holding anything unless they picked something up along the way.

Wait, after step 9, the agent dropped red_box_1 in room_3, then went to unlock grey_door_2. So steps 9-11:

9. drop red_box_1 room_3
10. gotodoor grey_door_2 room_3 room_1
11. toggle grey_door_2 (unlock)
12. gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_2 (now in room_1)
13. Now, they are in room_1 but not holding anything. To satisfy the constraint that after being in room_4, they must be in room_1 holding something, they need to pick up an object in room_1. The objects in room_1 are grey_ball_1 and green_box_1.

So step 13: gotoobject green_box_1 room_1
14. pick green_box_1 room_1 (now holding it)
15. Then, they can drop it if needed, but the constraint just requires that they are holding something while in room_1 after being in room_4. So this satisfies the constraint.

Now, to achieve the main goal, the agent can be in front of grey_door_2 in room_1, which is unlocked. So:

16. gotodoor grey_door_2 room_1 room_3 (now in front of it)
17. check if it's unlocked. Yes, step 11 unlocked it.

So the final state is being in front of grey_door_2, which is grey and unlocked. This satisfies the goal.

Now, let's check all constraints:

1. Agent was in room_4 initially (yes).
2. After room_4, they are in room_1 holding green_box_1 (steps 13-14).
3. green_door_1 was unlocked in step 2.
4. When green_door_1 was unlocked, later they held red_box_1 (step 7) and red_door_1 was unlocked (step 3).
5. When in front of green_door_1 (step 2), they had previously held yellow_box_1 (step 1).
6. When in room_2 (step 5), they had previously held grey_box_1 (step 4).
7. When in front of grey_door_1 (if any), but in this plan, they didn't go there. Instead, they went to grey_door_2. So the constraint about grey_door_1 front is not triggered.
Wait, the constraint says: "The following expression must hold in at least one state: "you are in front of grey_door_1". And if so, then red_box_1 must have been in room_3 earlier. But in this plan, the agent doesn't go to grey_door_1, so that constraint is not applicable. But the original problem says "the following expression must hold in at least one state: you are in front of grey_door_1". So this is required. Oh right, one of the constraints is that the agent must be in front of grey_door_1 at least once. So the plan must include that.

This complicates things. So the agent must be in front of grey_door_1 in some state. So the current plan doesn't address that. So we need to adjust.

So the agent must:

- Be in front of grey_door_1 at least once.

And when that happens, there must have been a previous state where red_box_1 was in room_3.

In the current plan, red_box_1 was moved to room_3 (step 9), so that's satisfied. Then, the agent can go to grey_door_1 later.

So after step 15 (holding green_box_1 in room_1), the agent can go to room_2 via grey_door_1 (which is still locked). Wait, no. grey_door_1 is locked unless unlocked. So after step 4, the agent unlocked green_door_1 and red_door_1. Then, in step 11, they unlocked grey_door_2. So grey_door_1 is still locked.

To unlock grey_door_1, the agent needs to be in front of it. So from room_1 or room_2.

But the agent is in room_1. So:

16. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2
17. toggle grey_door_1 (unlock it)
18. Now, in front of grey_door_1, which is grey and unlocked. This satisfies the main goal.

But the main goal requires that the agent is in front of a grey, unlocked door. So step 17 would satisfy this. However, the agent must be in front of it after unlocking. So after step 17, the agent is in front of grey_door_1, which is now unlocked. That's the goal.

So the plan would include steps to unlock grey_door_1, and the final action is being in front of it.

But also, the constraint requires that the agent is in front of grey_door_1 at least once. So step 16 is going to the door, step 17 is toggling (unlocking), and step 18 is being in front of it. But after toggling, the door is unlocked. So the final state would be in front of grey_door_1, which is grey and unlocked. So this satisfies the main goal.

But let's check all constraints again:

- Must be in front of grey_door_1: step 16 and 17.
- When in front of grey_door_1 (step 16), red_box_1 must have been in room_3 earlier. Which happened in step 9.
- The agent must be in room_2 at least once: yes, step 5 when entering room_2.
- When in room_2, must have previously held grey_box_1: yes, step 4.
- The agent must hold some object at least once: steps 1,4,7,14.
- green_door_1 must be locked at some point. Initially, it's locked. Then step 2 unlocks it. To have it locked again, the agent must toggle it again. But the constraint says green_door_1 must be locked at some state. Initially, it's locked. So the initial state satisfies that. But the constraint says if green_door_1 is locked in some state s, then the agent must hold something at s or after. In the initial state, green_door_1 is locked, and the agent is not holding anything. So this would violate the constraint unless the agent later holds something. Which they do (step 1). So the initial state's green_door_1 being locked is okay because the agent later holds yellow_box_1.

But the constraint says "If green_door_1 is locked in some state s, then the agent must hold something at s or after." In the initial state, s is the starting state where green_door_1 is locked. At that time, the agent is not holding anything, but they must hold something at s or after. Since they do hold things later, this is satisfied.

So the plan needs to include:

- Unlocking grey_door_1 and being in front of it.

But let's rework the plan to include this.

Revised steps:

1. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_4
2. pick yellow_box_1 room_4
3. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2
4. toggle green_door_1 (unlocked)
5. gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_3
6. toggle red_door_1 (unlocked)
7. gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_1
8. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_3
9. pick grey_box_1 room_3
10. gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_1
11. gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_1 (now in room_2, holding grey_box_1)
12. gotoempty room_2
13. drop grey_box_1 room_2
14. gotoobject red_box_1 room_2
15. pick red_box_1 room_2
16. gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1
17. gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_1
18. gotoempty room_3
19. drop red_box_1 room_3 (now red_box_1 is in room_3)
20. gotodoor grey_door_2 room_3 room_1
21. toggle grey_door_2 (unlocked)
22. gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_2
23. gotoobject green_box_1 room_1
24. pick green_box_1 room_1 (now holding it)
25. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2
26. toggle grey_door_1 (unlocked)
27. Now, in front of grey_door_1, which is grey and unlocked. This satisfies the main goal.

Check the constraints:

- green_door_1 is locked initially, then unlocked. The constraint requires green_door_1 to be locked in some state (initial) and not locked in another (step 4). Also, when green_door_1 is locked (initially), the agent later holds something (steps 2, etc.).

- When in front of green_door_1 (step 3), they had held yellow_box_1 (step 2).

- When in room_2 (steps 11-15), they had held grey_box_1 (steps 9-13).

- When in front of grey_door_1 (step 25), red_box_1 was in room_3 (step 19).

- The agent holds objects at steps 2,9,15,24.

- The green_door_1 is locked initially and then unlocked. The constraint that green_door_1 must be locked in some state is satisfied by the initial state.

- The agent is in room_4 initially, then later in room_1 holding green_box_1 (step 24).

So this plan should satisfy all constraints and achieve the goal. Now, let's write this out as actions, making sure each step is possible.

But let's check the steps for validity:

Step 1: gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_4. Possible since agent is in room_4.

Step 2: pick yellow_box_1 room_4. Possible (in room_4, not holding anything).

Step 3: gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2. Possible (in room_4, door connects to room_2, no blocking object).

Step 4: toggle green_door_1. Possible (in front of it).

Step 5: gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_3. Possible (in room_4, door connects to room_3).

Step 6: toggle red_door_1. Possible (in front of it).

Step 7: gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_1. Possible (door is unlocked).

Step 8: gotoobject grey_box_1 room_3. Possible (in room_3).

Step 9: pick grey_box_1 room_3. Possible (not holding anything).

Step 10: gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_1. Possible (door unlocked).

Step 11: gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_1. Possible (green_door_1 is unlocked).

Step 12: gotoempty room_2. Possible.

Step 13: drop grey_box_1 room_2. Possible (holding it, in front of empty spot).

Step 14: gotoobject red_box_1 room_2. Possible (in room_2).

Step 15: pick red_box_1 room_2. Possible (not holding anything).

Step 16: gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1. Possible (door unlocked).

Step 17: gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_1. Possible.

Step 18: gotoempty room_3. Possible.

Step 19: drop red_box_1 room_3. Possible.

Step 20: gotodoor grey_door_2 room_3 room_1. Possible.

Step 21: toggle grey_door_2. Possible (unlock it).

Step 22: gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_2. Possible (door unlocked).

Step 23: gotoobject green_box_1 room_1. Possible.

Step 24: pick green_box_1 room_1. Possible.

Step 25: gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2. Possible.

Step 26: toggle grey_door_1. Possible (unlock it).

Step 27: Now in front of grey_door_1, which is grey and unlocked. Goal achieved.

But step 26 toggles the door from locked to unlocked. So after step 26, the door is unlocked. The agent is in front of it. So the final state is achieved.

But the agent is holding green_box_1. Do they need to be holding anything? The goal doesn't specify, so it's fine.

Now, check if all constraints are met:

- Must be in room_4 at least once: yes (initial state).

- If in room_4 (initially), then must hold something in room_1 later: yes (step 24).

- green_door_1 must be unlocked at some state: step 4.

- When green_door_1 is unlocked (step 4), later hold red_box_1 (step 15) and red_door_1 is unlocked (step 6).

- When in front of green_door_1 (step 3), previously held yellow_box_1 (step 2).

- When in room_2 (step 11), previously held grey_box_1 (step 9).

- Must be in front of grey_door_1 (step 25), which requires red_box_1 was in room_3 (step 19).

- Must hold some object: yes (multiple steps).

- green_door_1 must be locked in some state: initially yes.

- If green_door_1 is locked (initially), agent holds something later: yes (steps 2, etc.).

This seems to satisfy all constraints. Now, let's write the plan in the required format, ensuring that each action is correctly formatted and the steps are optimal.

But wait, can we optimize this plan? For example, after step 19 (dropping red_box_1 in room_3), the agent could go directly to grey_door_2 instead of going back to room_1. Let me see:

After step 19, the agent is in room_3, not holding anything. They need to unlock grey_door_2 and go to room_1.

Step 20: gotodoor grey_door_2 room_3 room_1

Step 21: toggle grey_door_2 (unlock)

Step 22: gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_2

Then pick up green_box_1 in room_1, then go to grey_door_1, unlock it, and be in front of it.

This is the same as before. But perhaps there's a shorter path.

Alternatively, after step 26, the agent is in front of grey_door_1, which is grey and unlocked. That's the goal. So steps 25-26 are sufficient.

But the plan as written has 26 steps. Let's count the actions:

Actions are numbered 1 to 26. But maybe some steps can be skipped.

For example, after step 15 (holding red_box_1 in room_2), instead of going to room_4 and then room_3 to drop it, can they go directly to room_3 via room_1 if grey_door_2 is unlocked? But grey_door_2 is still locked at this point. So no.

Another optimization: after step 6 (unlock red_door_1), the agent is in room_4. Then they go to room_3 (step7), pick grey_box_1 (steps 8-9), then return to room_4 (step10), go to room_2 (step11), drop grey_box_1 (steps12-13), pick red_box_1 (steps14-15), go to room_4 (step16), then room_3 (step17), drop red_box_1 (step19), unlock grey_door_2 (steps20-21), go to room_1 (step22), pick green_box_1 (steps23-24), go to grey_door_1 (step25), unlock it (step26).

This seems necessary to satisfy all constraints. So the plan is likely optimal as it stands.
