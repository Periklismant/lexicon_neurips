Alright, let's break down the problem and analyze the constraints to come up with a valid plan.

First, I'll summarize the initial state of the world:
- You are in room_1.
- purple_ball_1 and green_box_1 are in room_1.
- yellow_box_1 is in room_2.
- green_ball_1, red_box_1, and blue_box_1 are in room_3.
- purple_box_1 and yellow_ball_1 are in room_4.
- All doors (yellow_door_1, grey_door_1, blue_door_1, green_door_1) are locked.
- yellow_door_1 connects room_1 and room_2.
- grey_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3.
- blue_door_1 connects room_2 and room_4.
- green_door_1 connects room_3 and room_4.

The goal is: There's a door "d" such that "d is green", "room_4 and room_3 are connected via d", "you are in front of d", and "d is not locked". The only door that satisfies these conditions is green_door_1, which connects room_3 and room_4.

Now, let's look at the constraints, which will guide our plan:

1. "grey_door_1 is locked" must be true in at least one state. (It's initially locked, so this is already satisfied).
2. If "grey_door_1 is locked", then "you are in front of red_box_1" must be true in the same state or a future state.
3. "you are holding some object" must be true in at least one state.
4. "you are in room_3" must be true in at least one state.
5. If "you are in room_3", then in an earlier state, you must be "holding green_ball_1" or "holding some object".
6. "you are in front of green_ball_1" must be true in at least one state.
7. "grey_door_1 is not locked" must be true in at least one state.
8. If "grey_door_1 is not locked", then in an earlier state, you must be "in room_3".
9. Either "yellow_door_1 is not locked" or "you are holding some object" must be true in at least one state.
10. "you are holding yellow_box_1" must be true in at least one state.

Let's reason about the ordering based on the constraints:

From constraint 8, we know that before unlocking grey_door_1, we need to be in room_3. But from constraint 5, before going to room_3, we need to be holding green_ball_1 or some other object. Initially, all doors are locked, so we need to unlock a door to go anywhere.

From constraint 10, we need to hold yellow_box_1, which is in room_2. So, we need to unlock yellow_door_1 (which connects room_1 and room_2) to get to room_2.

Now, is it logically possible to satisfy these constraints:

1. If I need to go to room_3 before unlocking grey_door_1 and I need to unlock grey_door_1 to go to room_3, we might have a circular dependency.

But let's see:
- We start in room_1.
- To go to room_3, we'd need to unlock grey_door_1.
- But to unlock grey_door_1, we need to already be in room_3 (from constraint 8).
- But, maybe this means that we need to go to room_3 from somewhere else and not via grey_door_1.

The possible routes to room_3 are:
1. From room_1 via grey_door_1.
2. From room_4 via green_door_1.

To reach room_4, we need to go from room_2 via blue_door_1 or from room_3 via green_door_1 (the latter can be ruled out since we're trying to reach room_3).

So, a possible path could be:
room_1 -> unlock yellow_door_1 -> room_2 -> unlock blue_door_1 -> room_4 -> unlock green_door_1 -> room_3.

Then, after we're in room_3, we could go back to room_1 via grey_door_1 to ensure that we unlock grey_door_1 after having been in room_3, satisfying constraint 8.

However, constraint 2 says that if grey_door_1 is locked (which is true initially), then we need to be in front of red_box_1 either in the same state or later. red_box_1 is in room_3. So, we need to go to room_3 to satisfy this constraint.

Let's try to reconcile these constraints. I think the key is that "grey_door_1 is locked" is true initially, and Constraint 2 says "If grey_door_1 is locked, then you are in front of red_box_1 at that state or in the future". red_box_1 is in room_3, and we need to somehow get to room_3 to be in front of red_box_1.

If we're going to room_3 without unlocking grey_door_1, we need to go through room_4 via green_door_1. 

And once we're in room_3, we can address constraint 7, which says "grey_door_1 is not locked" must be true in at least one state. Since we would be in room_3, we can now satisfy constraint 8.

Let's try to develop a high-level plan:

1. Start in room_1.
2. Unlock yellow_door_1 and go to room_2.
3. Pick up yellow_box_1 in room_2 (satisfying constraint 10 and part of constraint 9).
4. Unlock blue_door_1 and go to room_4.
5. Unlock green_door_1 and go to room_3.
6. At this point, we've been in room_3 while holding yellow_box_1 (satisfying constraints 4 and 5).
7. Go in front of green_ball_1 and red_box_1 (satisfying constraints 6 and 2).
8. Go in front of grey_door_1 and unlock it (satisfying constraint 7).
9. Go to room_1 via grey_door_1, drop yellow_box_1, and go back to room_3.
10. Go in front of green_door_1 and unlock it (if it's locked again, which would happen if we toggled it to go from room_3 to room_4 or vice versa).

This should satisfy all the constraints. But let's check the goal again:

The goal is to be in front of green_door_1 (which connects room_3 and room_4) and for it to be unlocked. The high-level plan we've developed should end with us in front of green_door_1 and it being unlocked, satisfying the goal.

Now, let's work out the detailed plan step by step.

Actually, before going into the detailed steps, there's a small issue I noticed: In step 10 of our high-level plan, I mentioned about unlocking green_door_1 if it's locked again. But if we go from room_3 to room_4 via green_door_1 in step 10, we can't be in front of green_door_1. We'd need to go to green_door_1, unlock it if it's locked, and then not go through it. Let's be careful about this in our detailed plan.

Let's start from the beginning:

1. Start in room_1 with grey_door_1 locked (satisfying constraint 1).
2. Go in front of yellow_door_1 (this door connects room_1 and room_2).
3. Unlock yellow_door_1 (satisfying part of constraint 9).
4. Go to room_2 via yellow_door_1.
5. Go in front of yellow_box_1 in room_2.
6. Pick up yellow_box_1 (satisfying constraint 10, constraint 3, and part of constraint 9).
7. Go in front of blue_door_1 (this door connects room_2 and room_4).
8. Unlock blue_door_1.
9. Go to room_4 via blue_door_1.
10. Go in front of green_door_1 (this door connects room_3 and room_4).
11. Unlock green_door_1.
12. Go to room_3 via green_door_1 (now you're in room_3 while holding yellow_box_1, satisfying constraints 4 and 5).
13. Go in front of green_ball_1 (satisfying constraint 6).
14. Go in front of red_box_1 (satisfying constraint 2).
15. Go in front of grey_door_1 (this door connects room_1 and room_3).
16. Unlock grey_door_1 (satisfying constraint 7 and, since you've been in room_3 before unlocking it, constraint 8 is also satisfied).
17. Go to room_1 via grey_door_1.
18. Go to an empty position in room_1.
19. Drop yellow_box_1.
20. Go in front of grey_door_1.
21. Go to room_3 via grey_door_1.
22. Go in front of green_door_1 (this door connects room_3 and room_4).
23. Ensure green_door_1 is unlocked. If it's locked, unlock it.

At this point, you are in front of green_door_1, which is green, connects room_3 and room_4, and is unlocked. This satisfies the goal.

However, I'm not sure if the door gets relocked when you pass through it. I'm guessing doors stay unlocked until explicitly locked with the toggle action. But let's be careful, if after you go from room_4 to room_3 via green_door_1 the door gets automatically locked, you'd need to unlock it again. Since the rules don't specify this, I'll assume doors stay in the state you leave them.

Let me check again if the plan satisfies all the constraints:

1. "grey_door_1 is locked" is true in the initial state (constraint 1).
2. "You are in front of red_box_1" at step 14, after grey_door_1 is locked (constraint 2).
3. "You are holding some object" from step 6 to step 19, where you're holding yellow_box_1 (constraint 3).
4. "You are in room_3" at step 12 and after (constraint 4).
5. Before being in room_3 at step 12, you were "holding some object" (yellow_box_1) from step 6, satisfying constraint 5.
6. "You are in front of green_ball_1" at step 13 (constraint 6).
7. "grey_door_1 is not locked" from step 16 onwards (constraint 7).
8. Before unlocking grey_door_1 at step 16, you were in room_3 from step 12 to step 16, satisfying constraint 8.
9. "yellow_door_1 is not locked" from step 3 onwards and "you are holding some object" from step 6 to step 19, satisfying constraint 9.
10. "You are holding yellow_box_1" from step 6 to step 19 (constraint 10).

All constraints are satisfied. Now, let me provide the detailed plan using the action format specified.

Let's translate the high-level plan into the specified action format, where actions are of the form "ActionName Argument1 ... ArgumentN":

1. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2
2. toggle yellow_door_1
3. gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1
4. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_2
5. pick yellow_box_1 room_2
6. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_4
7. toggle blue_door_1
8. gotoroom room_2 room_4 blue_door_1
9. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3
10. toggle green_door_1
11. gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1
12. gotoobject green_ball_1 room_3
13. gotoobject red_box_1 room_3
14. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1
15. toggle grey_door_1
16. gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1
17. gotoempty
18. drop yellow_box_1 room_1
19. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_3
20. gotoroom room_1 room_3 grey_door_1
21. gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4

Oh wait, I'm worried I've messed up the ordering of the room names in the "goto door" and "goto room" actions. Let's make sure I'm using them correctly. 

According to the preconditions:
- "goto door": you may only go in front of a door "d" if (i) you are in a room which door "d" is connecting with another room.
- "goto room": you may only go in a room "r" if (i) you are currently in a room "r0" that is adjacent to "r".

So in "goto door", the door argument should be the door you want to go to, and the room arguments are the rooms it connects. 

In "goto room", the first room "r0" is the room you're currently in, the second room "r" is the room you want to go to, and the door "d" is the door connecting those two rooms.

For my plan, the "goto door" and "goto room" actions should be correct.

Oh I just checked, I think I'm actually mistaken about the format. For "goto door", I think I only need to specify the door and the two rooms it connects, and for "goto room", it's more like I need to say where I am, where I'm going, and the door I'm using.

Let me redo the action plan to be more precise:

1. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2
2. toggle yellow_door_1
3. gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1
4. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_2
5. pick yellow_box_1 room_2
6. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_4
7. toggle blue_door_1
8. gotoroom room_2 room_4 blue_door_1
9. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3
10. toggle green_door_1
11. gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1
12. gotoobject green_ball_1 room_3
13. gotoobject red_box_1 room_3
14. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1
15. toggle grey_door_1
16. gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1
17. gotoempty
18. drop yellow_box_1 room_1
19. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_3
20. gotoroom room_1 room_3 grey_door_1
21. gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4

This seems correct to me.

But wait, let me double check with the original goal: "There is a door d such that "The following conditions are all true: "d is green", "room_4 and room_3 are connected via d", "you are in front of d", "d is not locked"""

After the plan we have:
1. "d is green" - Yes, green_door_1 is green.
2. "room_4 and room_3 are connected via d" - Yes, room_4 and room_3 are connected via green_door_1.
3. "you are in front of d" - Yes, after the plan we're in front of green_door_1.
4. "d is not locked" - This should also be true, as we unlocked green_door_1 at step 10, and we haven't toggled it since.

Let's just double check if we may have toggled the green_door_1 implicitly by moving through it.

Actually, the plan is a bit tricky because we're going back and forth between rooms and doors, and also picking up and dropping items. Let's just be cautious and ensure that green_door_1 is definitely unlocked by the end of our plan.

After step 10, where we toggle green_door_1, we go through it at step 11. From the provided effects, toggling a door changes its locked state (if locked, it becomes unlocked, and if unlocked, it becomes locked). But there doesn't seem to be any effect that says the door state changes when you go through it. So, after step 11, green_door_1 should still be unlocked. 

Actually, at step 21, we go in front of green_door_1 from room_3. After this, we should be in front of green_door_1, and it should still be unlocked. So, the goal is satisfied.

Wait let me re-check my logic here. After step 21, I check the state:

1. We're in room_3.
2. We're in front of green_door_1 (which connects room_3 and room_4).
3. green_door_1 is not locked (it was toggled at step 10 and hasn't been toggled since, the effects don't include door states changing when going through them).

So the plan satisfies the goal. Let's write up the final plan:

```
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2
toggle yellow_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1
gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_2
pick yellow_box_1 room_2
gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_4
toggle blue_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_4 blue_door_1
gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3
toggle green_door_1
gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1
gotoobject green_ball_1 room_3
gotoobject red_box_1 room_3
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1
toggle grey_door_1
gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1
gotoempty
drop yellow_box_1 room_1
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_3
gotoroom room_1 room_3 grey_door_1
gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4
```

This should be the optimal plan that satisfies the given goal and constraints.

Let me just check if I have the format correct for the plan one more time. The plan should be delimited by lines containing only 3 '`' characters. I'll include these in the final answer.

Hmm, actually, let's make sure that the plan is optimal. Let's try to think if there's a shorter alternative:

From the constraints, we know:
1. We need to be holding yellow_box_1 at some point.
2. We need to be in room_3 at some point, and before that, we need to be holding some object.
3. We need to be in front of green_ball_1 and red_box_1 at some point.
4. We need to see grey_door_1 both as locked and unlocked. And before it's unlocked, we need to be in room_3.

Given these constraints and the goal to be in front of green_door_1 with it unlocked, I think our plan is pretty direct. I don't see an obvious way to shorten it.

Actually, I'm thinking more about it now. There are a few observations:

1. For constraint 5, it says "If expression 'you are in room_3' holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: 'At least one of the following conditions is true: "you are holding green_ball_1", "you are holding some object"'". This means that we need to be holding an object (not necessarily green_ball_1) before going to room_3. In our plan, we're holding yellow_box_1 before going to room_3, so this constraint is met.

2. For constraint 8, it says "If expression 'grey_door_1 is not locked' holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: 'you are in room_3'". This means we need to have been in room_3 before unlocking grey_door_1. In our plan, we go to room_3, then go to grey_door_1 and unlock it, satisfying this constraint.

I've checked and verified that the constraints are satisfied correctly and the goal is met.

But just re-reading constraint 2: "If grey_door_1 is locked, then red_box_1 must be in front of you in the same state or later." I want to be careful here. grey_door_1 is locked in the initial state. We satisfy the constraint by going to room_3 and being in front of red_box_1 at step 13, before we unlock grey_door_1 at step 15. 

I just wanted to double-check, and this is indeed satisfied correctly in our plan. I'm convinced that the plan is optimal and correctly satisfies all constraints and the goal.

Ok, let me restate our optimal action plan in the right format, from the beginning one more time:

```
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2
toggle yellow_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1
gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_2
pick yellow_box_1 room_2
gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_4
toggle blue_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_4 blue_door_1
gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3
toggle green_door_1
gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1
gotoobject green_ball_1 room_3
gotoobject red_box_1 room_3
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1
toggle grey_door_1
gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1
gotoempty
drop yellow_box_1 room_1
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_3
gotoroom room_1 room_3 grey_door_1
gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4
```

Now I just reread the original rules and I realized I might be making a mistake. Let me check the rule for `gotodoor`:

"goto door": you may only go in front of a door "d" if (i) you are in a room which door "d" is connecting with another room, and (ii) there is no object blocking the position in front of "d" in the room you are currently in.

It looks like this action `gotodoor d r1 r2` seems like it means that I, the agent, is in room `r1` and is going to the door `d`, that connects room `r1` and room `r2`. Note also that the door is `d` and not necessarily "`r1`\_door\_`r2`". Let me use this understanding to check my plan.

Actually, I'm a bit confused about the syntax. Let me try to infer it from the preconditions and effects.

For "goto door", the preconditions are:
- you're in a room connected by door "d"
- there's no object blocking the door in your room

For "goto room", the preconditions are:
- you're in a room "r0" adjacent to room "r" (i.e., connected to "r")
- the door connecting "r0" and "r" is unlocked

For the "goto door" action, the syntax is "gotodoor d r1 r2". From the preconditions, it's established that the agent is already in a room. So, "d" is the door the agent is going to, and "r1" and "r2" are the two rooms connected by door "d". The agent must be in one of these rooms (either "r1" or "r2").

For the "goto room" action, the syntax is "gotoroom r1 r2 d". From the preconditions, the agent is in room "r1" and is going to room "r2" using door "d", which connects these two rooms.

Given this interpretation, I think the original plan's syntax should be correct, but let me double-check once more.

At the beginning, you're in room_1. yellow_door_1 connects room_1 and room_2, so "gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2" makes sense.

Actually, wait. I'm rereading the specs. For the "gotodoor" action, its effect is: "After performing this action regarding a door d, (i) if you were in front of some object or door x0, then you are no longer in front of x0 and (ii) you are in front of door d."

I'm thinking the syntax "gotodoor d r1 r2" indicates that:
- "d" is the door the agent is going to.
- "r1" and "r2" are the two rooms that door "d" connects.

For the "gotoroom" action, its effect is: "After performing this action in order to go from room r1 to room r2, (i) you are no longer in r1, (ii) you are in r2, (iii) you have visited r2, (iv) if you were in front of some object or door x0, then you are no longer in front of x0."

I believe the syntax "gotoroom r1 r2 d" indicates that:
- "r1" is the room the agent is currently in.
- "r2" is the room the agent is going to.
- "d" is the door connecting rooms "r1" and "r2" that the agent is using to go from "r1" to "r2".

Given this understanding, I think the original plan's syntax has been correct.

But wait, actually rereading the spec, I think I need to make one more revision. For the `gotodoor` action, the precondition states "you may only go in front of a door d if (i) you are in a room which door d is connecting with another room".

This suggests that "gotodoor d r1 r2" means:
- "d" is the door the agent is going to.
- The agent is in room "r1".
- Door "d" connects room "r1" to room "r2".

I think this interpretation aligns with the spec, though I'm a bit uncertain after rereading a few times. For the sake of clarity, I'll stick with this interpretation and make sure the plan is consistent.

So, starting from room_1:

1. "gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2": We go to yellow_door_1, which connects room_1 and room_2. We're currently in room_1.
2. "toggle yellow_door_1": We unlock yellow_door_1.
3. "gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1": We go from room_1 to room_2 using yellow_door_1.
4. "gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_2": We go to yellow_box_1 in room_2.
5. "pick yellow_box_1 room_2": We pick up yellow_box_1.
6. "gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_4": We go to blue_door_1, which connects room_2 and room_4. We're currently in room_2.
7. "toggle blue_door_1": We unlock blue_door_1.
8. "gotoroom room_2 room_4 blue_door_1": We go from room_2 to room_4 using blue_door_1.
9. "gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3": We go to green_door_1, which connects room_4 and room_3. We're currently in room_4.
10. "toggle green_door_1": We unlock green_door_1.
11. "gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1": We go from room_4 to room_3 using green_door_1.
12. "gotoobject green_ball_1 room_3": We go to green_ball_1 in room_3.
13. "gotoobject red_box_1 room_3": We go to red_box_1 in room_3.
14. "gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1": We go to grey_door_1, which connects room_3 and room_1. We're currently in room_3.
15. "toggle grey_door_1": We unlock grey_door_1.
16. "gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1": We go from room_3 to room_1 using grey_door_1.
17. "gotoempty": We go to an empty position in the room.
18. "drop yellow_box_1 room_1": We drop yellow_box_1.
19. "gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_3": We go to grey_door_1, which connects room_1 and room_3. We're currently in room_1.
20. "gotoroom room_1 room_3 grey_door_1": We go from room_1 to room_3 using grey_door_1.
21. "gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4": We go to green_door_1, which connects room_3 and room_4. We're currently in room_3.

Actually, I'm thinking about the "gotodoor" action. I reread the spec, and it says "goto door": you may only go in front of a door "d" if (i) you are in a room which door "d" is connecting with another room. This to me implies that you are going to door "d" while in a room that the door is connected to.

I *think* the action format, based on the described effects, would be "gotodoor d r1 r2" where:
- "d" is the door the agent is going to.
- "r1" is one of the rooms that door "d" connects.
- "r2" is the other room that door "d" connects.

Let's use this interpretation (which I think is the right one, though I'm a bit confused by the wording of the spec) and make sure the plan remains consistent. Since both rooms r1 and r2 are rooms that the door connects, and the spec doesn't make clear which is which, let's determine the ordering of the rooms from the provided information.

Actually, I think I should be using the format given in the spec: The original state of the world says "room_2 and room_1 are connected via yellow_door_1" and "room_1 and room_2 are connected via yellow_door_1". This suggests to me that the order doesn't matter, and that yellow_door_1 connects both room_1 and room_2, and room_2 and room_1. Importantly, I also note that for gotodoor d r1 r2, we want to be in room r1 and the door connects to room r2.

At this point, I'm going to stop trying to outsmart myself. I think both the format of the plan and the plan's content are accurate.

```

This plan should satisfy all the contraints and achieve the goal of being in front of green_door_1 with it unlocked.

Oh actually wait, let me make sure the constraints are all valid:

1. "grey_door_1 is locked" is true in the initial state (constraint 1).
2. "You are in front of red_box_1" at step 13, after grey_door_1 is locked (constraint 2).
3. "You are holding some object" from step 5 to step 18, where you're holding yellow_box_1 (constraint 3).
4. "You are in room_3" at step 11 and after (constraint 4).
5. Before being in room_3 at step 11, you were "holding some object" (yellow_box_1) from step 5, satisfying constraint 5.
6. "You are in front of green_ball_1" at step 12 (constraint 6).
7. "grey_door_1 is not locked" from step 15 onwards (constraint 7).
8. Before unlocking grey_door_1 at step 15, you were in room_3 from step 11 to step 14, satisfying constraint 8.
9. "yellow_door_1 is not locked" from step 2 onwards and "you are holding some object" from step 5 to step 18, satisfying constraint 9.
10. "You are holding yellow_box_1" from step 5 to step 18 (constraint 10).

All the constraints are satisfied.

And for the goal, we are in front of the green door (which connects room_3 and room_4) from step 21 onwards, and the green door is unlocked (having been unlocked at step 10 and not locked since). So the goal is achieved.

I believe this is an optimal plan given the constraints and the goal. I'm not sure if there's a shorter alternative, but this path seems to handle the constraints in a direct manner.

Ok let's do one more check:

- Goal: "There is a door d such that "The following conditions are all true: "d is green", "room_4 and room_3 are connected via d", "you are in front of d", "d is not locked"""

At the end of our plan, we're in front of green_door_1 (which is green), green_door_1 connects room_3 and room_4, and green_door_1 is unlocked. Goal achieved.

- Constraint 1: grey_door_1 is locked during the initial state, until step 15 when we unlock it. Satisfied.
- Constraint 2: We are in front of red_box_1 at step 13, after grey_door_1 is locked. Satisfied.
- Constraint 3: We are holding yellow_box_1 from steps 5 to 18. Satisfied.
- Constraint 4: We are in room_3 at and after step 11. Satisfied.
- Constraint 5: Before being in room_3 at step 11, we are already holding yellow_box_1. Satisfied.
- Constraint 6: We are in front of green_ball_1 at step 12. Satisfied.
- Constraint 7: grey_door_1 is unlocked at and after step 15. Satisfied.
- Constraint 8: Before unlocking grey_door_1 at step 15, we are already in room_3. Satisfied.
- Constraint 9: yellow_door_1 is not locked from step 2 onwards. Satisfied.
- Constraint 10: We are holding yellow_box_1 from steps 5 to 18. Satisfied.

All constraints are satisfied, I'm confident in this plan.

Will one more time write the full plan in the correct format:
