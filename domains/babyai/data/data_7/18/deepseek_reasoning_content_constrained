Okay, let's try to figure out how to solve this planning problem. The goal is to be in front of a green door connecting room_4 and room_3, which is unlocked. The door in question here is green_door_1 since it connects room_3 and room_4 and is green. So, the final state needs me to be in front of green_door_1, which is unlocked. Also, there are a bunch of constraints that must be satisfied throughout the plan.

First, let's list out all the constraints to make sure I don't miss any:

1. At some state, grey_door_1 is locked.
2. If grey_door_1 is locked in a state, then I must be in front of red_box_1 either in that state or a later one.
3. At some state, I'm holding an object.
4. At some state, I'm in room_3.
5. If I'm in room_3 in a state, there must be an earlier state where I was holding green_ball_1 or any object.
6. At some state, I'm in front of green_ball_1.
7. At some state, grey_door_1 is unlocked.
8. If grey_door_1 is unlocked in a state, there must be an earlier state where I was in room_3.
9. At some state, either yellow_door_1 is unlocked or I'm holding an object.
10. At some state, I'm holding yellow_box_1.

Okay, so the plan must include actions that satisfy all these constraints while achieving the goal. Let's start by considering the initial state. I'm in room_1, which has purple_ball_1 and green_box_1. All doors are locked initially. The doors are yellow_door_1 (connects room_1 and room_2), grey_door_1 (connects room_1 and room_3), blue_door_1 (room_2 and room_4), and green_door_1 (room_3 and room_4).

The goal requires me to be in front of green_door_1 in room_3 or room_4, and it must be unlocked. Since green_door_1 is initially locked, I need to toggle it. To toggle a door, I have to be in front of it. But to get to green_door_1, I need to move through the rooms. Let's see the connections.

From room_1, the doors are yellow_door_1 (to room_2) and grey_door_1 (to room_3). Both are locked. So, first, I need to unlock either of these doors. But to unlock a door, I need to be in front of it. But since the doors are locked, I can't go through them yet. Wait, the action 'toggle d' can unlock a door if I'm in front of it. So, if I can reach the door in the current room, toggle it to unlock, then use gotoroom to move through.

Wait, the preconditions for 'gotodoor d r1 r2' are that I'm in a room connected by d, and there's no object blocking the position in front of d in my current room. Since initially, all doors are locked, but I can still go in front of them if there's no object blocking. Let's check the initial positions of objects. In room_1, there's purple_ball_1 and green_box_1. Are these blocking the doors? The problem statement says that "the position in front of d in the room you are currently in" must not be blocked. But I don't have information about where exactly the objects are placed relative to doors. Assuming that the presence of an object in the room doesn't block the door unless specified. Wait, the problem statement mentions that "if x was blocking some door, then it is no longer blocking that door" when you pick up x. But in the initial state, there's no mention of any door being blocked by objects. So maybe the doors are not blocked initially. Therefore, I can go to the doors even if there are objects in the room. So, perhaps the initial state allows me to go in front of doors even if there are objects elsewhere.

So, in room_1, I can 'gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_3'? Let me check the preconditions for 'gotodoor': I must be in a room connected by d (room_1 is connected via grey_door_1 to room_3), and no object is blocking the position in front of d in room_1. Since the initial state doesn't mention any door being blocked, perhaps the doors are not blocked. So I can 'gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_3' from room_1. Then, toggle it to unlock. But wait, the door is locked, so after toggling, it becomes unlocked. Then I can 'gotoroom room_1 room_3 grey_door_1' to move to room_3.

But wait, the 'gotoroom' action requires the door to be unlocked. So first, go to the door, toggle to unlock, then go through.

But first, let's see the constraints. One of the constraints is that in some state, grey_door_1 must be locked. However, in the initial state, grey_door_1 is locked. So that's already satisfied. But another constraint says that if grey_door_1 is locked in some state, then in that state or a later one, I must be in front of red_box_1. Since the initial state has grey_door_1 locked, then I need to be in front of red_box_1 at some point. Red_box_1 is in room_3. So I need to get to room_3 and go in front of red_box_1.

But to get to room_3, I need to unlock grey_door_1. Wait, but in the initial state, grey_door_1 is locked, so I can't go through it. So the plan would be:

1. In room_1, goto grey_door_1 (gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_3)
2. Toggle grey_door_1 to unlock it.
3. Gotoroom from room_1 to room_3 via grey_door_1.

Then, in room_3, there's green_ball_1, red_box_1, and blue_box_1. The constraints require that when I'm in room_3, there must have been an earlier state where I was holding some object or green_ball_1. Also, I need to be in front of green_ball_1 at some point, and hold yellow_box_1 at some point.

Moreover, the goal is to be in front of green_door_1 (which connects room_3 and room_4), which is unlocked. So after getting to room_3, I need to go to green_door_1, unlock it (if it's locked), but the initial state says green_door_1 is locked. Wait, the problem's initial state says all doors are locked, so green_door_1 is locked. So I need to unlock it by toggling it. But to toggle it, I need to be in front of it. So in room_3, I can 'gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4', then toggle it to unlock. Then, be in front of it, which would satisfy the goal (as long as it's unlocked).

But the goal requires that "there is a door d such that d is green, connects room_4 and room_3, you are in front of d, and d is not locked." The door is green_door_1, so after unlocking it and being in front of it, that's the goal state.

But let's outline the steps:

From room_1:

1. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_3
2. toggle grey_door_1 (unlocks it)
3. gotoroom room_1 room_3 grey_door_1 (now in room_3)
4. Now, in room_3, need to go to green_door_1, which connects to room_4.
5. gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4
6. toggle green_door_1 (unlocks it)
7. Now, I'm in front of green_door_1, which is unlocked. This satisfies the goal.

But wait, the problem says that the final goal is to be in front of the green door (d) that connects room_4 and room_3, and it's unlocked. So step 6 would leave me in front of green_door_1 in room_3, with it unlocked. That would meet the goal. However, let's check if all constraints are met in this process.

Let's check the constraints one by one:

1. "grey_door_1 is locked" must hold in at least one state. Initially, it's locked. Then in step 2, it's unlocked. So the initial state satisfies this.

2. If grey_door_1 is locked in some state, then in that state or a later one, I must be in front of red_box_1. The initial state has grey_door_1 locked. So I need to be in front of red_box_1 at some point. But in the current plan, after unlocking grey_door_1 and moving to room_3, I don't go to red_box_1. So that's a problem. Therefore, I need to make sure that after the initial state (where grey_door_1 is locked), I go to red_box_1 at some point.

So, after step 3 (in room_3), I need to gotoobject red_box_1 room_3. Then, that would satisfy the constraint. But when do I do that?

Let me adjust the plan:

After step 3 (arrive in room_3), step 4 would be gotoobject red_box_1 room_3. Then proceed to handle green_door_1.

But let's see:

Current steps:

1. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_3
2. toggle grey_door_1 (unlock)
3. gotoroom room_1 room_3 grey_door_1 (now in room_3)
4. gotoobject red_box_1 room_3 (to satisfy constraint 2)
5. gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4
6. toggle green_door_1 (unlock)
7. Now, in front of green_door_1, which is unlocked. Done.

But what about the other constraints?

Constraint 3: At some state, holding an object. The plan so far doesn't involve picking up anything. So we need to include an action where I pick up an object. Also, constraint 10 requires that I hold yellow_box_1 at some state. Yellow_box_1 is in room_2. So to hold yellow_box_1, I need to go to room_2, pick it up. But room_2 is connected to room_1 via yellow_door_1, which is locked. So I need to unlock yellow_door_1 as well.

But this complicates the plan. Let's see. The constraints that require holding an object (constraint 3) and specifically holding yellow_box_1 (constraint 10) must be satisfied. So I need to pick up yellow_box_1. Let's see how to get to room_2.

From room_1, the yellow_door_1 connects to room_2. But initially, it's locked. So I need to unlock it. But to do that, I need to go to yellow_door_1 in room_1, toggle it to unlock. Then go to room_2, pick up yellow_box_1.

But how does this fit into the current plan?

Alternatively, maybe after going to room_3 and handling the red_box_1 and green_door_1, but that might not be possible because room_2 is separate.

Alternatively, perhaps the plan can be adjusted to first unlock yellow_door_1, go to room_2, pick up yellow_box_1, then proceed.

But let's see the constraints again. Also, constraint 9 requires that in some state, either yellow_door_1 is unlocked or I'm holding an object. Since yellow_door_1 is initially locked, if I unlock it, that satisfies the first part. Alternatively, if I hold an object at any point, that also satisfies it. But since we need to hold yellow_box_1 (constraint 10), that would cover constraint 9 as well. So if I hold yellow_box_1, that satisfies constraint 9.

But to hold yellow_box_1, I need to be in room_2. To get to room_2, I need to unlock yellow_door_1. Let's think.

So, the initial steps could be:

1. In room_1, go to yellow_door_1 (gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2)
2. toggle to unlock it.
3. go to room_2 (gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1)
4. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_2
5. pick yellow_box_1 room_2 (now holding it)
6. Then, go back to room_1 via yellow_door_1 (if needed)

But this might complicate the other steps. Let's see how this affects the other constraints.

But wait, the main goal is to be in front of green_door_1 (room_3-room_4 door) unlocked. So perhaps after unlocking yellow_door_1 and getting yellow_box_1, then proceed to unlock grey_door_1, go to room_3, handle the other constraints.

But let's think about the order.

Alternatively, perhaps it's more efficient to handle room_3 first. Let me outline a possible plan:

1. In room_1, go to grey_door_1 (gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_3)
2. toggle grey_door_1 (unlock)
3. go to room_3 (gotoroom room_1 room_3 grey_door_1)
4. In room_3, go to red_box_1 (to satisfy constraint 2)
5. Then, go to green_ball_1 (constraint 6)
6. pick green_ball_1 (to satisfy constraint 5: when in room_3, earlier state held some object)
7. drop green_ball_1 (maybe)
8. Then, go to green_door_1 in room_3, toggle it (unlock)
9. Now, be in front of green_door_1 unlocked.

But this plan would need to also include picking up yellow_box_1 from room_2. So after step 3 (in room_3), how do I get to room_2? Because room_2 is connected to room_1 and room_4. So from room_3, maybe I need to go back to room_1, then to room_2.

But let's see. To get to room_2 from room_3, I need to go through room_1 via grey_door_1 (unlocked), then from room_1 to room_2 via yellow_door_1 (locked, needs to be unlocked). But if I have already unlocked grey_door_1 and yellow_door_1 is still locked.

Wait, but in the initial plan, I haven't unlocked yellow_door_1. So if I need to get to room_2 to pick up yellow_box_1, I need to unlock yellow_door_1 first.

This is getting complicated. Let's try to structure the plan step by step, considering all constraints.

Constraints to satisfy:

- Must hold yellow_box_1 at some point (constraint 10). So need to go to room_2, pick it up.

- Must be in room_3 (constraint 4). So need to go there.

- When in room_3, must have previously held some object (constraint 5). So before entering room_3, I need to have picked up something. Or, after entering room_3, pick up something. But entering room_3 is via grey_door_1. So if I unlock grey_door_1 and go to room_3, but before that, I need to pick up an object. But initially, I'm in room_1. The objects in room_1 are purple_ball_1 and green_box_1. So I could pick up one of them before going to room_3.

Wait, but if I pick up an object in room_1, then go to grey_door_1, unlock it, then go to room_3. That would satisfy constraint 5: when entering room_3, there was a previous state where I was holding an object.

So here's a possible approach:

1. In room_1, gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_1
2. pick purple_ball_1 room_1 (now holding it, satisfies constraint 3 and 10? No, because 10 requires holding yellow_box_1. So this only satisfies constraint 3.)
3. drop purple_ball_1 room_1 (if needed)
4. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_3
5. toggle grey_door_1 (unlock)
6. gotoroom room_1 room_3 grey_door_1 (now in room_3)
7. Now, in room_3, need to go to red_box_1 (constraint 2)
8. gotoobject red_box_1 room_3
9. Then, go to green_ball_1 (constraint 6)
10. gotoobject green_ball_1 room_3
11. pick green_ball_1 (optional, but maybe needed for constraint 5)
12. drop green_ball_1
13. Then, go to green_door_1 in room_3
14. toggle green_door_1 (unlock)
15. Now in front of green_door_1, which is unlocked. Goal achieved.

But this plan doesn't handle yellow_box_1. So need to incorporate that.

So, after dropping purple_ball_1 in room_1, I need to unlock yellow_door_1 to get to room_2, pick up yellow_box_1.

But how to fit this into the plan.

Alternative approach:

1. In room_1, go to yellow_door_1 (gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2)
2. toggle yellow_door_1 (unlock)
3. gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1 (now in room_2)
4. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_2
5. pick yellow_box_1 (satisfies constraint 10)
6. Now, need to get back to room_1. So go back through yellow_door_1 (unlocked)
7. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_1
8. toggle yellow_door_1 (lock it again? Not necessary, but maybe not needed. Alternatively, just go through.)
9. gotoroom room_2 room_1 yellow_door_1 (back to room_1)
10. Now, go to grey_door_1 in room_1
11. toggle grey_door_1 (unlock)
12. gotoroom room_1 room_3 grey_door_1 (now in room_3)
13. gotoobject red_box_1 room_3 (satisfy constraint 2)
14. gotoobject green_ball_1 room_3 (satisfy constraint 6)
15. Now, go to green_door_1 in room_3
16. toggle green_door_1 (unlock)
17. Now in front of green_door_1, unlocked. Goal achieved.

This plan includes picking up yellow_box_1 (step 5), which satisfies constraint 10. Also, constraint 3 (holding an object) is satisfied in step 5. Constraint 9 (yellow_door_1 unlocked or holding object) is satisfied when yellow_door_1 is unlocked (step 2), and also when holding yellow_box_1. So that's covered.

Constraints check:

1. grey_door_1 is locked in initial state. So that's covered.

2. When grey_door_1 is locked (initially and until step 11), after that, we go to red_box_1 in step 13. So that's satisfied.

3. Holding yellow_box_1 in step 5.

4. In room_3 at step 12.

5. When in room_3 (step 12), earlier state (step 5) where holding yellow_box_1.

6. In front of green_ball_1 in step 14.

7. grey_door_1 becomes unlocked at step 11. So some state after that, it's unlocked. So constraint 7 is satisfied.

8. When grey_door_1 is unlocked (after step 11), there must be an earlier state where I was in room_3. Wait, no. The constraint is: if grey_door_1 is unlocked in some state, there must be an earlier state where I was in room_3. But unlocking grey_door_1 happens in room_1. Wait, no. The action to toggle grey_door_1 (step 11) is done from room_1. So after toggling, grey_door_1 is unlocked. Then, gotoroom to room_3. So when grey_door_1 is unlocked (after step 11), the state after that is being in room_3. But the constraint says that if grey_door_1 is unlocked in a state, there must be an earlier state where I was in room_3. But in this plan, the first time I'm in room_3 is after unlocking grey_door_1, which would mean that when grey_door_1 is unlocked (step 11), the next state is entering room_3. So the unlocking happens in room_1, then moving to room_3. So when grey_door_1 is unlocked (state after step 11), the next step is being in room_3. So there's no earlier state where I was in room_3 before unlocking grey_door_1. That violates constraint 8. Because constraint 8 says that if grey_door_1 is not locked (i.e., unlocked) in some state, then there must be an earlier state where I was in room_3. But in this plan, grey_door_1 is unlocked in step 11 (while still in room_1), and then I go to room_3. So the state where grey_door_1 is unlocked is before being in room_3. Therefore, the constraint is not satisfied. Therefore, this plan is invalid.

So this is a problem. The constraint says that whenever grey_door_1 is not locked (unlocked), there must have been an earlier state where I was in room_3. But in this plan, grey_door_1 is unlocked in room_1, and then I go to room_3. So at the state where grey_door_1 is unlocked (after step 11), I haven't been to room_3 yet. Therefore, this violates constraint 8. So the plan is invalid.

Hmm, this is a critical issue. So how can we satisfy constraint 8? The constraint says that if grey_door_1 is not locked in any state, then there must be an earlier state where I was in room_3. But how can I have been in room_3 before unlocking grey_door_1? Because to get to room_3, I need to go through grey_door_1, which is initially locked. Unless there's another way, but the rooms are connected via doors. So the only way to room_3 is through grey_door_1 from room_1, or through green_door_1 from room_4. But room_4 is connected via blue_door_1 from room_2, which is locked. So perhaps another path.

Wait, the connections are:

- room_1 connected to room_2 via yellow_door_1.

- room_1 connected to room_3 via grey_door_1.

- room_2 connected to room_4 via blue_door_1.

- room_3 connected to room_4 via green_door_1.

So to get to room_4 from room_3 via green_door_1 (which is locked initially).

Alternatively, perhaps from room_1 to room_3 via grey_door_1 (unlocked), but to unlock grey_door_1, you have to be in front of it in room_1. But to unlock it, you need to be in room_1. So the only way to get to room_3 is by unlocking grey_door_1 from room_1, then entering. Therefore, the act of unlocking grey_door_1 happens in room_1. Therefore, after unlocking, you can enter room_3. But the constraint says that if grey_door_1 is unlocked in any state, there must be a prior state where you were in room_3. Which is impossible unless you have been to room_3 before unlocking it. Which you can't do. Therefore, this seems impossible. But there must be a way, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the constraint.

Wait, the constraint says: "If expression 'grey_door_1 is not locked' holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: 'you are in room_3'".

Wait, no. The constraint is: If grey_door_1 is not locked in some state s, then there exists an earlier state (before s) where I was in room_3.

So, for example, if I unlock grey_door_1 in room_1 (state s1), then in state s1, grey_door_1 is unlocked. But I have to have been in room_3 before s1. But how? Because to get to room_3, I need to go through grey_door_1, which was locked before s1. Therefore, it's impossible. Therefore, this constraint seems impossible. But the problem must have a solution, so perhaps I'm misinterpreting the constraint.

Wait, looking back at the constraints:

The eighth constraint is: "If expression 'grey_door_1 is not locked' holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: 'you are in room_3'".

So, whenever grey_door_1 is unlocked (in any state), I must have been in room_3 before that state. So for example, if I unlock grey_door_1 in room_1 (state s), then in some state before s, I must have been in room_3. But how can I get to room_3 before unlocking grey_door_1? It's impossible unless there's another path. But according to the problem statement, the rooms are connected only via the specified doors. So room_3 is only accessible from room_1 via grey_door_1 and from room_4 via green_door_1. So unless there's a way to get to room_4 via other doors and then to room_3.

Let's see: room_4 is connected to room_2 via blue_door_1 and to room_3 via green_door_1. So if I can get to room_4 via room_2, then from room_4 to room_3 via green_door_1. But room_2 is connected to room_1 via yellow_door_1 (locked) and to room_4 via blue_door_1 (locked). So to get to room_2, I need to unlock yellow_door_1. Then from room_2, unlock blue_door_1 to get to room_4. Then from room_4, unlock green_door_1 to get to room_3. But that's a long way around.

Wait, let's try this path:

1. In room_1, unlock yellow_door_1:

   a. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2

   b. toggle yellow_door_1 (unlock)

   c. gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1 (now in room_2)

2. In room_2, unlock blue_door_1 to room_4:

   a. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_4

   b. toggle blue_door_1 (unlock)

   c. gotoroom room_2 room_4 blue_door_1 (now in room_4)

3. In room_4, unlock green_door_1 to room_3:

   a. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3

   b. toggle green_door_1 (unlock)

   c. gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1 (now in room_3)

4. Now, in room_3, which satisfies constraint 4. Also, constraint 8 requires that if grey_door_1 is unlocked, then I was in room_3 before. So if I now go back to room_1 via grey_door_1, which is still locked. So need to unlock grey_door_1, but according to this path, I'm in room_3. To unlock grey_door_1, I need to go to room_1's side of the door. Wait, but grey_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3. So if I'm in room_3, can I go to grey_door_1 and unlock it from there?

But the problem statement says that doors are two-way. So the door is in both rooms. So from room_3, I can 'gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1', then toggle it. But initially, grey_door_1 is locked. So from room_3, can I go to grey_door_1, unlock it, then go to room_1?

Yes. Let's see:

Continuing the plan:

5. In room_3, goto grey_door_1 (gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1)

6. toggle grey_door_1 (unlock)

Now, grey_door_1 is unlocked. According to constraint 8, since grey_door_1 is now unlocked (state after step 6), there must be a previous state where I was in room_3. Which is true, since I was in room_3 before step 5. So that satisfies constraint 8.

Then, proceed to the goal.

But the goal is to be in front of green_door_1 (which is now unlocked) in room_3 or room_4. So from room_3, after unlocking green_door_1 (step 3b?), wait, no. In this path, we unlocked green_door_1 from room_4 (step 3b). Then, in room_3, we can go to green_door_1 (in room_3), which is now unlocked. So after step 3c (in room_3), we can go to green_door_1 in room_3, toggle it (already unlocked), and be in front of it.

But let's adjust the plan:

Steps 1-3:

1. Unlock yellow_door_1, go to room_2.

2. Unlock blue_door_1, go to room_4.

3. Unlock green_door_1, go to room_3.

4. Now in room_3. Need to unlock grey_door_1 from room_3's side.

5. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1.

6. toggle grey_door_1 (unlock)

Now, grey_door_1 is unlocked. At this point, according to constraint 8, since grey_door_1 is now unlocked, there must have been an earlier state where I was in room_3. Which is true (step 3c, 4, 5, etc.). So that's okay.

Now, to satisfy constraint 2: if grey_door_1 was ever locked (which it was in initial state and up to step 6), then in that state or a later one, I must be in front of red_box_1. Since grey_door_1 was locked in the initial state and up to step 6, after step 6, when it's unlocked, but I'm in room_3, I need to go to red_box_1 in room_3.

So step 7: gotoobject red_box_1 room_3.

Also, constraint 6 requires being in front of green_ball_1, which is in room_3. So step 8: gotoobject green_ball_1 room_3.

Constraint 5: when in room_3 (steps 3c, 4, etc.), there must be an earlier state where I was holding some object. So before entering room_3 for the first time (step 3c), I need to have held an object. But in this path, the first time I enter room_3 is step 3c, and before that, I was in room_4, which doesn't have any objects picked up. So need to pick up an object before step 3c.

In this path, I could pick up an object in room_2 (yellow_box_1) or room_4 (purple_box_1 or yellow_ball_1).

For example:

After step 1c (in room_2), pick up yellow_box_1:

1d. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_2

1e. pick yellow_box_1 (satisfies constraint 10 and 3)

Then proceed to room_4.

So inserting steps 1d and 1e:

1. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2

2. toggle yellow_door_1

3. gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1

4. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_2

5. pick yellow_box_1 room_2

6. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_4

7. toggle blue_door_1

8. gotoroom room_2 room_4 blue_door_1 (now in room_4)

Now, in room_4, there's purple_box_1 and yellow_ball_1. Then:

9. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3

10. toggle green_door_1 (unlock)

11. gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1 (now in room_3)

12. Now, in room_3. We have to satisfy constraint 5: when in room_3, there must be an earlier state where holding something. Earlier state was step 5 (holding yellow_box_1), so that's satisfied.

Then proceed:

13. gotoobject red_box_1 room_3 (constraint 2)

14. gotoobject green_ball_1 room_3 (constraint 6)

15. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1

16. toggle grey_door_1 (unlock)

Now, grey_door_1 is unlocked. Constraint 8 is satisfied because we were in room_3 before step 16.

Then, need to go to green_door_1 in room_3, which is already unlocked (step 10). So:

17. gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4

18. Now, in front of green_door_1, which is unlocked. This satisfies the goal.

But wait, the goal requires being in front of a green door connecting room_4 and room_3, which is green_door_1. So step 17 is goto door green_door_1 room_3 room_4, then the current position is in front of green_door_1, which is unlocked. That meets the goal.

Now, check all constraints:

1. "grey_door_1 is locked" in initial state and up to step 16. So satisfied.

2. After grey_door_1 is locked (initial state), I went to red_box_1 in step 13. So satisfied.

3. Held yellow_box_1 in step 5. Satisfied.

4. In room_3 at step 11 onwards. Satisfied.

5. When in room_3 (step 11), earlier state (step 5) holding yellow_box_1. Satisfied.

6. In front of green_ball_1 in step 14. Satisfied.

7. grey_door_1 is unlocked in step 16. Satisfied.

8. When grey_door_1 is unlocked (step 16), earlier state (step 11) being in room_3. Satisfied.

9. At some state, yellow_door_1 is unlocked (step 2) or holding an object (steps 5-...). Satisfied.

10. Held yellow_box_1 in step 5. Satisfied.

Additionally, the goal is achieved in step 17 (goto door green_door_1 room_3 room_4), which is unlocked (step 10).

But wait, after step 10, green_door_1 is unlocked. So when I goto green_door_1 in step 17, then I'm in front of it and it's unlocked. So the goal is achieved.

Now, let's check the action sequence:

1. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2

2. toggle yellow_door_1

3. gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1

4. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_2

5. pick yellow_box_1 room_2

6. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_4

7. toggle blue_door_1

8. gotoroom room_2 room_4 blue_door_1

9. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3

10. toggle green_door_1

11. gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1

12. gotoobject red_box_1 room_3

13. gotoobject green_ball_1 room_3

14. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1

15. toggle grey_door_1

16. gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4

Wait, step 16 should be 'gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4', which is step 16. After that, the agent is in front of green_door_1, which is unlocked. But the agent is in room_3. So the final state meets the goal.

But wait, after step 11, the agent is in room_3. Then steps 12-16 are all in room_3. So step 16: gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4. Then, the agent is in front of green_door_1 in room_3, which is unlocked. That satisfies the goal.

So the plan would be:

```
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2
toggle yellow_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1
gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_2
pick yellow_box_1 room_2
gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_4
toggle blue_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_4 blue_door_1
gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3
toggle green_door_1
gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1
gotoobject red_box_1 room_3
gotoobject green_ball_1 room_3
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1
toggle grey_door_1
gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4
```

But wait, after step 15 (toggle grey_door_1), the agent is still in room_3. Then step 16 is gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4. This action requires being in room_3 (which we are), and the door connects room_3 and room_4. The door is unlocked. So this is valid. After this action, the agent is in front of green_door_1 in room_3, which is unlocked. So the goal is achieved.

This plan satisfies all constraints and the goal. Let's count the steps to see if it's optimal. But perhaps there's a shorter way. For example, after step 11 (in room_3), could we immediately go to green_door_1 instead of going to red_box_1 and green_ball_1 first? But those steps are required for constraints 2 and 6.

Wait, constraint 2 requires that if grey_door_1 is locked in any state, then in that state or a later one, I must be in front of red_box_1. The initial state has grey_door_1 locked, and it remains locked until step 15 (toggle grey_door_1 in room_3). So in the plan, after step 15, grey_door_1 is unlocked. But the initial state had it locked, and the constraint applies to any state where grey_door_1 is locked. So the initial state is such a state, and any subsequent states until step 15. Therefore, we need to be in front of red_box_1 in any state after the initial state. So in this plan, step 12 (gotoobject red_box_1 room_3) occurs after the initial state, satisfying the constraint.

Similarly, step 13 (gotoobject green_ball_1 room_3) satisfies constraint 6.

But is there a way to optimize the plan by combining steps or reducing steps? For example, after being in room_3 (step 11), can we first go to green_door_1, unlock it, then handle the other constraints? But the problem is that green_door_1 is already unlocked in step 10. So after step 11, the green_door_1 is unlocked, so just going to it would satisfy the goal. But we need to fulfill all constraints.

Alternatively, perhaps the order of steps can be adjusted. For example, after step 11 (in room_3), goto green_door_1 first, then handle red_box_1 and green_ball_1. But that would still require the same number of steps. The optimal plan requires the shortest possible length. Let's see if any steps are redundant.

In the current plan:

1. goto yellow_door_1

2. toggle

3. goto room_2

4. goto yellow_box_1

5. pick

6. goto blue_door_1

7. toggle

8. goto room_4

9. goto green_door_1

10. toggle

11. goto room_3

12. goto red_box_1

13. goto green_ball_1

14. goto grey_door_1

15. toggle

16. goto green_door_1

Total 16 steps.

Is there a shorter way? Let's think.

Alternative approach:

What if after unlocking green_door_1 (step 10) and entering room_3 (step 11), instead of going to red_box_1 and green_ball_1, can we immediately go to green_door_1? But that would miss constraint 2 and 6. So no.

Another idea: Can we hold yellow_box_1 in room_2, drop it in room_1, then proceed to unlock grey_door_1, enter room_3, and pick up green_ball_1 to satisfy constraint 5. But this adds more steps.

Alternatively, after step 5 (holding yellow_box_1), drop it somewhere to free hands to pick up another object. But this would require more steps.

Alternatively, instead of going all the way through room_2 and room_4 to reach room_3, what if we unlock grey_door_1 first, but then have to satisfy constraint 8, which requires that if grey_door_1 is unlocked, there's a prior state in room_3. Which is impossible unless we go through another path. So that's why the current plan is necessary.

Thus, the current plan seems to be the shortest possible, considering all constraints. Hence, it's optimal.
