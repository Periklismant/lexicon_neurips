Let me understand the problem:

1. I'm an agent in a 2D gridworld with 4 rooms arranged in a square formation.
2. I need to plan actions to achieve a goal state.
3. My goal is to be in front of a blue box.
4. I must adhere to several constraints that must hold at some point during the plan execution.

Let's start by analyzing the initial state and the goal:

Initial State:
- I am in room_3.
- In room_1: purple_box_1
- In room_2: green_box_1, grey_box_1
- In room_3: blue_ball_1, grey_box_2, blue_ball_2, blue_box_1
- In room_4: grey_box_3
- All doors are locked.
- I have visited room_3.

Goal:
- Be in front of a blue box (could be blue_box_1).

Now, let's analyze the constraints:
1. At least one of: "you are holding grey_box_3" or "green_box_1 is in room_3" must be true at some point.
2. At least one of: "you are holding blue_ball_1" or "you are in front of purple_box_1" must be true at some point.
3. "you are holding some object" must be true at some point (this seems redundant given constraint 6, but I'll note it).
4. "you are holding some object" again (redundant).
5. At least one of: "you are holding some object" or "you are holding green_box_1" must be true at some point (this seems redundant too).
6. "you are holding blue_ball_1" and "you are in front of grey_box_1" must both be true at some point.
7. "you are holding grey_box_3" must be true at some point.

Given these constraints, I need to:
- Pick up blue_ball_1 and be in front of grey_box_1 at the same time. This means I need to be in the same room as grey_box_1 (room_2) and have blue_ball_1 in my hands.
- Pick up grey_box_3 at some point. Since it's in room_4, I need to go there.
- Either move green_box_1 to room_3 or pick up grey_box_3. Given that I need to pick up grey_box_3 for constraint 7, I can just satisfy this by doing that.
- Either pick up blue_ball_1 or be in front of purple_box_1. Given that I need to pick up blue_ball_1 for constraint 6, I can just satisfy this by doing that.

To reach the goal, I need to be in front of blue_box_1, which is in room_3.

Let's plan:
1. First, I need to access other rooms by unlocking doors. I'm in room_3, and I need to visit room_2 (for grey_box_1) and room_4 (for grey_box_3).
2. I'll first unlock the door to room_1, then to room_2, so I can get to grey_box_1.
3. Pick up blue_ball_1 in room_3 and take it to room_2.
4. While holding blue_ball_1, go in front of grey_box_1 to satisfy constraint 6.
5. Drop blue_ball_1 and go back to room_3.
6. Unlock the door to room_4.
7. Go to room_4 and pick up grey_box_3 to satisfy constraint 7.
8. Drop grey_box_3 and go back to room_3.
9. Go in front of blue_box_1 to satisfy the goal.

This plan seems to satisfy all the constraints and the goal. Let's now write out the sequence of actions:

Actually, let me verify that I understand the actions correctly:

- "gotoobject x r": Go in front of to object x in room r.
- "gotoempty": Go in front of an empty position of the room, which does not contain any object.
- "gotodoor d r1 r2": Go in front of door d, connecting room r1 to room r2.
- "gotoroom r1 r2 d": Go to room r2 from room r1 using door d.
- "pick x r": Pick up object x in room r.
- "drop x r": Drop object x in room r.
- "toggle d": Unlock door d if is locked. Lock door d if is unlocked.

Now, let's revise the plan:

1. First, I need to access other rooms by unlocking doors. I'm in room_3.
2. I need to go in front of the door connecting to room_1, unlock it, then go to room_1.
3. In room_1, I need to go in front of the door connecting to room_2, unlock it, then go to room_2.
4. Pick up blue_ball_1 in room_3 and take it to room_2.
5. While holding blue_ball_1, go in front of grey_box_1 to satisfy constraint 6.
6. Drop blue_ball_1 and go back to room_3.
7. Go in front of the door connecting to room_4, unlock it, then go to room_4.
8. In room_4, pick up grey_box_3 to satisfy constraint 7.
9. Drop grey_box_3 and go back to room_3.
10. Go in front of blue_box_1 to satisfy the goal.

Actually, I need to re-evaluate this plan. Let's consider the constraints more carefully. To satisfy constraint 6, I need to hold blue_ball_1 while being in front of grey_box_1. This means I need to pick up blue_ball_1 in room_3, go to room_2, and then go in front of grey_box_1 (while holding blue_ball_1).

But this introduces a problem: I need to go through rooms to get from room_3 to room_2, and to do that, I need to open doors first. However, I may not be able to pick up blue_ball_1 before opening the doors, because I might need to interact with the doors.

Let's re-examine the initial state and the available paths between rooms:
- I start in room_3.
- room_3 is connected to room_1 via blue_door_1.
- room_3 is connected to room_4 via grey_door_1.
- room_1 is connected to room_2 via purple_door_1.
- room_2 is connected to room_4 via red_door_1.

So to get from room_3 to room_2, I could go either through room_1 or through room_4.

Wait, I don't think the previous plan works. Let me reconsider the problem. I need to:
1. Pick up blue_ball_1 (it's in room_3) and go to room_2 to go in front of grey_box_1 (to satisfy constraint 6).
2. Pick up grey_box_3 at some point (it's in room_4) (to satisfy constraint 7).
3. Be in front of blue_box_1 at the end (it's in room_3) (to satisfy the goal).

Let's approach it step by step:

Starting position: I'm in room_3, and I need to unlock doors to access other rooms.
1. First, I need to unlock the door to room_1 (blue_door_1).
   - Go in front of blue_door_1 (connecting room_3 and room_1).
   - Unlock blue_door_1.

2. Go to room_1.

3. Unlock the door to room_2 (purple_door_1).
   - Go in front of purple_door_1 (connecting room_1 and room_2).
   - Unlock purple_door_1.

4. Go back to room_3.

5. Pick up blue_ball_1.

6. Go to room_1, then to room_2.

7. Go in front of grey_box_1 (while still holding blue_ball_1). This satisfies constraint 6.

8. Drop blue_ball_1. Now, I need to get to room_4 to satisfy constraint 7.

9. Unlock the door to room_4 (red_door_1).
   - Go in front of red_door_1 (connecting room_2 and room_4).
   - Unlock red_door_1.

10. Go to room_4.

11. Pick up grey_box_3. This satisfies constraint 7.

12. Drop grey_box_3. Now, I need to go back to room_3 to satisfy the goal.

13. Unlock the door from room_4 to room_3 (grey_door_1).
    - Go in front of grey_door_1 (connecting room_4 and room_3).
    - Unlock grey_door_1.

14. Go to room_3.

15. Go in front of blue_box_1. This satisfies the goal.

This should satisfy all the constraints and the goal. Now, let's write out the exact actions:

Hmm, I'm not sure if the problem description requires me to declare the explicit actions "gotoobject", "gotodoor", etc., or if I'm supposed to derive these from higher-level actions. Let me assume the former and give the exact sequence of actions:

Actually let me re-read the description. I see that I misunderstood some actions earlier. This is the correct interpretation:

- "gotoobject x r": Go in front of object x in room r.
- "gotoempty": Go in front of an empty position of the room, which does not contain any object.
- "gotodoor d r1 r2": Go in front of door d, connecting room r1 to room r2.
- "gotoroom r1 r2 d": Go to room r2 from room r1 using door d.
- "pick x r": Pick up object x in room r.
- "drop x r": Drop object x in room r.
- "toggle d": Unlock door d if is locked. Lock door d if is unlocked.

Now, let's write the exact sequence of actions to satisfy my plan:

1. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_1
2. toggle blue_door_1
3. gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_1
4. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2
5. toggle purple_door_1
6. gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1
7. gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_4
8. toggle red_door_1
9. gotoroom room_2 room_4 red_door_1
10. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3
11. toggle grey_door_1
12. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1
13. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_3
14. pick blue_ball_1 room_3
15. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_1
16. gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_1
17. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2
18. gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1
19. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_2
20. gotoempty
21. drop blue_ball_1 room_2
22. gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_4
23. gotoroom room_2 room_4 red_door_1
24. gotoobject grey_box_3 room_4
25. pick grey_box_3 room_4
26. gotoempty
27. drop grey_box_3 room_4
28. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3
29. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1
30. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_3

Actually, hold on. I think I made an error. If I'm holding blue_ball_1, then go to room_2, am I still holding blue_ball_1? It's not clear from the effects of the "gotoroom" action. Let me re-read the effects description.

Ok, after re-reading the effects description of "gotoroom", it doesn't say anything explicitly about dropping what you're holding. So I'm going to assume that I continue to hold an object when changing rooms.

Let me actually look at the constraints more carefully again:

1. At least one of: "you are holding grey_box_3" or "green_box_1 is in room_3" must be true at some point.
2. At least one of: "you are holding blue_ball_1" or "you are in front of purple_box_1" must be true at some point.
3. "you are holding some object" must be true at some point.
4. "you are holding some object" again.
5. At least one of: "you are holding some object" or "you are holding green_box_1" must be true at some point.
6. "you are holding blue_ball_1" and "you are in front of grey_box_1" must both be true at some point.
7. "you are holding grey_box_3" must be true at some point.

For constraint 1, I need to either hold grey_box_3 or get green_box_1 to room_3. I'm already planning to hold grey_box_3 for constraint 7, so that takes care of constraint 1.

For constraint 2, I need to either hold blue_ball_1 or be in front of purple_box_1. I'm already planning to hold blue_ball_1 for constraint 6, so that takes care of constraint 2.

For constraints 3, 4, and 5, I need to hold an object at some point. By holding blue_ball_1 and grey_box_3 at different points in my plan, I satisfy these constraints.

For constraint 6, I need to hold blue_ball_1 and be in front of grey_box_1 at the same time. This is a bit trickier and I need to plan specifically for this.

For constraint 7, I need to hold grey_box_3 at some point.

Now, let's redo the plan:

1. I start in room_3.
2. I'll first unlock all doors to ensure I can move between rooms freely.
   a. Unlock blue_door_1 to access room_1.
   b. Go to room_1 and unlock purple_door_1 to access room_2.
   c. Go back to room_3 and unlock grey_door_1 to access room_4.
   d. Go to room_4 and unlock red_door_1 to access room_2.
3. Go back to room_3 and pick up blue_ball_1.
4. Go to room_2 (via room_1) and go in front of grey_box_1 while holding blue_ball_1 to satisfy constraint 6.
5. Drop blue_ball_1 and go to room_4 to pick up grey_box_3 to satisfy constraint 7.
6. Drop grey_box_3 and go back to room_3.
7. Go in front of blue_box_1 to satisfy the goal.

Let me write out the detailed actions:

1. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_1
2. toggle blue_door_1
3. gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_1
4. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2
5. toggle purple_door_1
6. gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_1
7. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4
8. toggle grey_door_1
9. gotoroom room_3 room_4 grey_door_1
10. gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2
11. toggle red_door_1
12. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1
13. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_3
14. pick blue_ball_1 room_3
15. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_1
16. gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_1
17. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2
18. gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1
19. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_2
20. gotoempty
21. drop blue_ball_1 room_2
22. gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_4
23. gotoroom room_2 room_4 red_door_1
24. gotoobject grey_box_3 room_4
25. pick grey_box_3 room_4
26. gotoempty
27. drop grey_box_3 room_4
28. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3
29. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1
30. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_3

Hmm, I'm unsure if I need to stop at line 19 after I go in front of grey_box_1 while holding blue_ball_1, or if I should drop blue_ball_1 first. Let me re-read the constraint:

6. "The following conditions are all true: 'you are holding blue_ball_1', 'you are in front of grey_box_1'"

So I need to be holding blue_ball_1 and be in front of grey_box_1 at the same time. I satisfy this at step 19.

Let me check the plan one more time:

1. Unlock doors to access all rooms.
2. Pick up blue_ball_1 in room_3.
3. Go to room_2 and go in front of grey_box_1 while holding blue_ball_1 to satisfy constraint 6.
4. Drop blue_ball_1 and go to room_4 to pick up grey_box_3 to satisfy constraint 7.
5. Drop grey_box_3 and go back to room_3.
6. Go in front of blue_box_1 to satisfy the goal.

This seems to satisfy all the constraints and the goal. Let's write out the detailed actions:

1. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_1
2. toggle blue_door_1
3. gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_1
4. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2
5. toggle purple_door_1
6. gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_1
7. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4
8. toggle grey_door_1
9. gotoroom room_3 room_4 grey_door_1
10. gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2
11. toggle red_door_1
12. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1
13. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_3
14. pick blue_ball_1 room_3
15. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_1
16. gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_1
17. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2
18. gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1
19. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_2
20. gotoempty
21. drop blue_ball_1 room_2
22. gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_4
23. gotoroom room_2 room_4 red_door_1
24. gotoobject grey_box_3 room_4
25. pick grey_box_3 room_4
26. gotoempty
27. drop grey_box_3 room_4
28. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3
29. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1
30. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_3

Wait, I think there's an error in my plan. At step 6, I tried to go from room_1 to room_3, but I should be going back to room_3 via room_1. Let me correct the plan:

1. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_1
2. toggle blue_door_1
3. gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_1
4. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2
5. toggle purple_door_1
6. gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1
7. gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_4
8. toggle red_door_1
9. gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1
10. gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_1
11. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4
12. toggle grey_door_1
13. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_3
14. pick blue_ball_1 room_3
15. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_1
16. gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_1
17. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2
18. gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1
19. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_2
20. gotoempty
21. drop blue_ball_1 room_2
22. gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_4
23. gotoroom room_2 room_4 red_door_1
24. gotoobject grey_box_3 room_4
25. pick grey_box_3 room_4
26. gotoempty
27. drop grey_box_3 room_4
28. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3
29. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1
30. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_3

Actually I realized that the plan still doesn't quite make sense. Let's reread the gridworld description once more to make sure I understand the layout correctly:

Gridworld consists of 4 rooms arranged in a square formation:
- room_1 is on the north-west
- room_2 is on the south-west
- room_3 is on the north-east
- room_4 is on the south-east

There are 4 doors connecting the following room pairs:
- room_1-room_2 (via purple_door_1)
- room_1-room_3 (via blue_door_1)
- room_2-room_4 (via red_door_1)
- room_3-room_4 (via grey_door_1)

So the layout looks like:

[room_1] -- blue_door_1 -- [room_3]
   |                           |
   |                           |
purple_door_1              grey_door_1
   |                           |
   |                           |
[room_2] -- red_door_1 --- [room_4]

Given this layout, let me correct the plan. I start in room_3, and I'll first unlock all the doors I need:

1. Unlock blue_door_1 to access room_1.
2. Go to room_1 and unlock purple_door_1 to access room_2.
3. Go back to room_3 and unlock grey_door_1 to access room_4.
4. Go to room_4 and unlock red_door_1 to access room_2.
5. Go back to room_3 and pick up blue_ball_1.
6. Go to room_2 (via room_1) and go in front of grey_box_1 while holding blue_ball_1 to satisfy constraint 6.
7. Drop blue_ball_1 and go to room_4 (via red_door_1) to pick up grey_box_3 to satisfy constraint 7.
8. Drop grey_box_3 and go back to room_3 (via grey_door_1).
9. Go in front of blue_box_1 to satisfy the goal.

Let me write out the detailed actions:

1. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_1
2. toggle blue_door_1
3. gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_1
4. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2
5. toggle purple_door_1
6. gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_1
7. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4
8. toggle grey_door_1
9. gotoroom room_3 room_4 grey_door_1
10. gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2
11. toggle red_door_1
12. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1
13. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_3
14. pick blue_ball_1 room_3
15. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_1
16. gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_1
17. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2
18. gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1
19. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_2
20. gotoempty
21. drop blue_ball_1 room_2
22. gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_4
23. gotoroom room_2 room_4 red_door_1
24. gotoobject grey_box_3 room_4
25. pick grey_box_3 room_4
26. gotoempty
27. drop grey_box_3 room_4
28. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3
29. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1
30. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_3

Let me double-check, particularly the movement between rooms:

1. We start in room_3.
2. Steps 1-2: We unlock blue_door_1 (connecting room_3 and room_1).
3. Step 3: We go to room_1 from room_3 via blue_door_1.
4. Steps 4-5: We unlock purple_door_1 (connecting room_1 and room_2).
5. Step 6: We return to room_3 from room_1 via blue_door_1.
6. Steps 7-8: We unlock grey_door_1 (connecting room_3 and room_4).
7. Step 9: We go to room_4 from room_3 via grey_door_1.
8. Steps 10-11: We unlock red_door_1 (connecting room_4 and room_2).
9. Step 12: We return to room_3 from room_4 via grey_door_1.
10. Steps 13-14: We pick up blue_ball_1 in room_3.
11. Step 15-16: We go to room_1 from room_3 via blue_door_1.
12. Steps 17-18: We go to room_2 from room_1 via purple_door_1.
13. Step 19: We go in front of grey_box_1 in room_2 (while holding blue_ball_1), satisfying constraint 6.
14. Steps 20-21: We drop blue_ball_1 in room_2.
15. Steps 22-23: We go to room_4 from room_2 via red_door_1.
16. Steps 24-25: We pick up grey_box_3 in room_4, satisfying constraint 7.
17. Steps 26-27: We drop grey_box_3 in room_4.
18. Steps 28-29: We go to room_3 from room_4 via grey_door_1.
19. Step 30: We go in front of blue_box_1 in room_3, satisfying the goal.

Actually, I see a potential flaw in my plan. When I "gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_1", it's not clear if I'm then able to "toggle blue_door_1" without first going to room_1. Let's check the action preconditions:

For "toggle d", it says "you may only toggle a door d if you are in front of d".

So it seems like I just need to be in front of the door, not necessarily in a specific room. This should work, but let me ensure I've gotten the door directions correct.

Let me read the problem statement again. It says "room_1 and room_2 are connected via purple_door_1", and also "room_2 and room_1 are connected via purple_door_1". This means I can go from room_1 to room_2 or from room_2 to room_1 using purple_door_1.

So the directions seem to be correct in my plan.

Actually, I just realized that the plan still has a mistake. at step 6, I wrote "gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_1", but this should be "gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_1".

Let me fix my plan:

1. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_1
2. toggle blue_door_1
3. gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_1
4. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2
5. toggle purple_door_1
6. gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_1  # This doesn't make sense. We're in room_1, so we should go back to room_3.
7. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4
8. toggle grey_door_1
9. gotoroom room_3 room_4 grey_door_1
10. gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2
11. toggle red_door_1
12. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1
13. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_3
14. pick blue_ball_1 room_3
15. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_1
16. gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_1
17. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2
18. gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1
19. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_2
20. gotoempty
21. drop blue_ball_1 room_2
22. gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_4
23. gotoroom room_2 room_4 red_door_1
24. gotoobject grey_box_3 room_4
25. pick grey_box_3 room_4
26. gotoempty
27. drop grey_box_3 room_4
28. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3
29. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1
30. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_3

Let me fix the plan again:

1. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_1
2. toggle blue_door_1
3. gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_1
4. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2
5. toggle purple_door_1
6. gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_1  # Wait, this is still wrong. We're in room_1, and we want to go to room_3 via blue_door_1.

Let me revise this again. The "gotoroom" action is defined as "Go to room r2 from room r1 using door d". So if I'm in room_1 and want to go to room_3 using blue_door_1, the action should be "gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_1".

So, let's start from the beginning:

I start in room_3, and I'll first unlock all the doors I need:

1. Unlock blue_door_1 to access room_1.
2. Go to room_1 and unlock purple_door_1 to access room_2.
3. Go back to room_3 and unlock grey_door_1 to access room_4.
4. Go to room_4 and unlock red_door_1 to access room_2.
5. Go back to room_3 and pick up blue_ball_1.
6. Go to room_2 (via room_1) and go in front of grey_box_1 while holding blue_ball_1 to satisfy constraint 6.
7. Drop blue_ball_1 and go to room_4 (via red_door_1) to pick up grey_box_3 to satisfy constraint 7.
8. Drop grey_box_3 and go back to room_3 (via grey_door_1).
9. Go in front of blue_box_1 to satisfy the goal.

1. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_1
2. toggle blue_door_1
3. gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_1
4. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2
5. toggle purple_door_1
6. gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_1  # This is correct: We're in room_1 and want to go to room_3.
7. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4
8. toggle grey_door_1
9. gotoroom room_3 room_4 grey_door_1
10. gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2
11. toggle red_door_1
12. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1
13. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_3
14. pick blue_ball_1 room_3
15. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_1
16. gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_1
17. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2
18. gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1
19. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_2
20. gotoempty
21. drop blue_ball_1 room_2
22. gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_4
23. gotoroom room_2 room_4 red_door_1
24. gotoobject grey_box_3 room_4
25. pick grey_box_3 room_4
26. gotoempty
27. drop grey_box_3 room_4
28. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3
29. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1
30. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_3

Hmm, I feel like I'm making a mistake. Let me just double-check the "gotoroom" action. The definition is "gotoroom r1 r2 d": Go to room r2 from room r1 using door d.

So if I'm in room_1 and want to go to room_3, the action should be "gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_1".

Let me just focus on the exact movement pattern in my plan and verify:

1. Start in room_3.
2. Unlock blue_door_1 (connecting room_3 and room_1).
3. Go to room_1 via blue_door_1: gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_1.
4. Unlock purple_door_1 (connecting room_1 and room_2).
5. Go back to room_3 via blue_door_1: gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_1.
6. Unlock grey_door_1 (connecting room_3 and room_4).
7. Go to room_4 via grey_door_1: gotoroom room_3 room_4 grey_door_1.
8. Unlock red_door_1 (connecting room_4 and room_2).
9. Go back to room_3 via grey_door_1: gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1.
10. Pick up blue_ball_1 in room_3.
11. Go to room_1 via blue_door_1: gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_1.
12. Go to room_2 via purple_door_1: gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1.
13. Go in front of grey_box_1 in room_2 (while holding blue_ball_1).
14. Drop blue_ball_1.
15. Go to room_4 via red_door_1: gotoroom room_2 room_4 red_door_1.
16. Pick up grey_box_3 in room_4.
17. Drop grey_box_3.
18. Go to room_3 via grey_door_1: gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1.
19. Go in front of blue_box_1 in room_3.

This movement pattern seems correct. Now, let's update my full plan:

1. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_1
2. toggle blue_door_1
3. gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_1
4. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2
5. toggle purple_door_1
6. gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_1
7. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4
8. toggle grey_door_1
9. gotoroom room_3 room_4 grey_door_1
10. gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2
11. toggle red_door_1
12. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1
13. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_3
14. pick blue_ball_1 room_3
15. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_1
16. gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_1
17. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2
18. gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1
19. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_2
20. gotoempty
21. drop blue_ball_1 room_2
22. gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_4
23. gotoroom room_2 room_4 red_door_1
24. gotoobject grey_box_3 room_4
25. pick grey_box_3 room_4
26. gotoempty
27. drop grey_box_3 room_4
28. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3
29. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1
30. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_3

This should now correctly represent the plan I've described. But actually, I just realized I might be overthinking this due to the ambiguity of the "gotoroom" action. Let's simplify and assume the action only cares about the current room, the destination room, and the door connecting them.

So, I'll just revise the plan once more, focusing on the logic:

1. Unlock blue_door_1 to go from room_3 to room_1.
2. Go to room_1 and unlock purple_door_1 to go from room_1 to room_2.
3. Go back to room_3 (via room_1) and unlock grey_door_1 to go from room_3 to room_4.
4. Go to room_4 and unlock red_door_1 to go from room_4 to room_2.
5. Go back to room_3 (via room_4) and pick up blue_ball_1.
6. Go to room_2 (via room_1) and go in front of grey_box_1 while holding blue_ball_1 to satisfy constraint 6.
7. Drop blue_ball_1 and go to room_4 (via room_2) to pick up grey_box_3 to satisfy constraint 7.
8. Drop grey_box_3 and go back to room_3 (via room_4).
9. Go in front of blue_box_1 to satisfy the goal.

Let me just revise the plan one last time, focusing on the logic and ensuring I don't miss any steps:

1. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_1
2. toggle blue_door_1
3. gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_1
4. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2
5. toggle purple_door_1
6. gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_1
7. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4
8. toggle grey_door_1
9. gotoroom room_3 room_4 grey_door_1
10. gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2
11. toggle red_door_1
12. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1
13. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_3
14. pick blue_ball_1 room_3
15. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_1
16. gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_1
17. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2
18. gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1
19. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_2
20. gotoempty
21. drop blue_ball_1 room_2
22. gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_4
23. gotoroom room_2 room_4 red_door_1
24. gotoobject grey_box_3 room_4
25. pick grey_box_3 room_4
26. gotoempty
27. drop grey_box_3 room_4
28. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3
29. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1
30. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_3

Actually there's a simpler route. Let me just solve the problem one more time. Let's think through it methodically:

I start in room_3. In room_3, there's blue_ball_1, grey_box_2, blue_ball_2, and blue_box_1. blue_door_1 connects to room_1 and grey_door_1 connects to room_4.

My goal is to be in front of blue_box_1, which is already in room_3.

Let's see what constraints I need to satisfy:
1. At least one of: "you are holding grey_box_3" or "green_box_1 is in room_3" must be true. I'll need to pick up grey_box_3 or move green_box_1 to room_3.
2. At least one of: "you are holding blue_ball_1" or "you are in front of purple_box_1" must be true. I'll need to pick up blue_ball_1 or go in front of purple_box_1.
3 & 4. "you are holding some object" must be true. I'll definitely pick up an object at some point.
5. At least one of: "you are holding some object" or "you are holding green_box_1" must be true. Covered by 3 & 4.
6. "you are holding blue_ball_1" and "you are in front of grey_box_1" must both be true at some point. Blue_ball_1 is in room_3, and grey_box_1 is in room_2. I'll need to pick up blue_ball_1 and then go to room_2 to stand in front of grey_box_1.
7. "you are holding grey_box_3" must be true at some point. Grey_box_3 is in room_4, so I'll need to go to room_4 and pick it up.

So my plan is:
1. Pick up blue_ball_1 in room_3.
2. Unlock doors to go to room_2 (via room_1).
3. Go to room_2 and go in front of grey_box_1 (while holding blue_ball_1) to satisfy constraint 6.
4. Drop blue_ball_1.
5. Unlock doors to go to room_4.
6. Go to room_4 and pick up grey_box_3 to satisfy constraint 7 (and consequently, constraint 1).
7. Drop grey_box_3.
8. Go back to room_3.
9. Go in front of blue_box_1 to satisfy the goal.

Oh, I realize I've been solving the problem in a suboptimal way. Instead of unlocking each door one by one, I can just pick up blue_ball_1 first, then start unlocking doors. Let me revise the plan:

1. In room_3, pick up blue_ball_1.
2. Unlock blue_door_1 to access room_1.
3. Go to room_1 and unlock purple_door_1 to access room_2.
4. Go to room_2 and go in front of grey_box_1 (while holding blue_ball_1) to satisfy constraint 6.
5. Drop blue_ball_1.
6. Unlock the door to room_4 (red_door_1).
7. Go to room_4 and pick up grey_box_3 to satisfy constraint 7.
8. Drop grey_box_3.
9. Go back to room_3 (we need to unlock grey_door_1 first).
10. Go in front of blue_box_1 to satisfy the goal.

This is a more straightforward plan. Let me write out the actions, all the way through. Let me double-check the constraints and the room layout once again to make sure I've got everything right.

Ok, so just to be sure, let me restate the constraints:
1. At least one of: "you are holding grey_box_3" or "green_box_1 is in room_3" must be true at some point.
2. At least one of: "you are holding blue_ball_1" or "you are in front of purple_box_1" must be true at some point.
3. "you are holding some object" must be true at some point.
4. "you are holding some object" again.
5. At least one of: "you are holding some object" or "you are holding green_box_1" must be true at some point.
6. "you are holding blue_ball_1" and "you are in front of grey_box_1" must both be true at some point.
7. "you are holding grey_box_3" must be true at some point.

Room layout:
[room_1] -- blue_door_1 -- [room_3]
   |                           |
   |                           |
purple_door_1              grey_door_1
   |                           |
   |                           |
[room_2] -- red_door_1 --- [room_4]

Here's the plan:
1. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_3
2. pick blue_ball_1 room_3
3. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_1
4. toggle blue_door_1
5. gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_1
6. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2
7. toggle purple_door_1
8. gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1
9. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_2  # Satisfy constraint 6 here. holding blue_ball_1 and in front of grey_box_1
10. gotoempty
11. drop blue_ball_1 room_2
12. gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_4
13. toggle red_door_1
14. gotoroom room_2 room_4 red_door_1
15. gotoobject grey_box_3 room_4
16. pick grey_box_3 room_4  # Satisfy constraint 7 here. Also satisfy constraint 1 (since I'm holding grey_box_3), 3,4, and 5.
17. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3
18. toggle grey_door_1
19. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1
20. gotoempty
21. drop grey_box_3 room_3
22. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_3  # Satisfy the goal here. I am in front of blue_box_1.

This plan should satisfy all constraints and reach the goal. But wait a minute, I should also check constraint 2. At least one of: "you are holding blue_ball_1" or "you are in front of purple_box_1" must be true at some point.

I pick up blue_ball_1 at step 2, so constraint 2 is also satisfied. Great!

Let me double-check that I haven't missed anything else.

Actually, wait. I just realized that purple_box_1 is in room_1. So I might be able to satisfy constraint 2 by going in front of purple_box_1, but I don't need to since I'm already picking up blue_ball_1 (which satisfies constraint 2). I just thought I'd note this in case there's a more optimal solution.

The optimal solution is the one I've outlined above, which takes 22 steps. Let me list the actions again to be sure:

1. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_3
2. pick blue_ball_1 room_3
3. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_1
4. toggle blue_door_1
5. gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_1
6. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2
7. toggle purple_door_1
8. gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1
9. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_2
10. gotoempty
11. drop blue_ball_1 room_2
12. gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_4
13. toggle red_door_1
14. gotoroom room_2 room_4 red_door_1
15. gotoobject grey_box_3 room_4
16. pick grey_box_3 room_4
17. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3
18. toggle grey_door_1
19. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1
20. gotoempty
21. drop grey_box_3 room_3
22. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_3

Actually I just realized that when I pick up an object, I'm no longer in front of that object. Let me re-read the effect description for the "pick" action:

"pick": After performing this action regarding an object x, (i) you are no longer in front of x, (ii) your hands are no longer empty, (iii) you are carrying x, (iv) x is no longer in the room, and (v) if x was blocking some door, then it is no longer blocking that door.

So when I pick up an object, I'm no longer in front of it. Similarly, when I drop an object, I become in front of it. I need to take this into account. Let me revise the plan one more time:

I start in room_3. I need to:
1. Pick up blue_ball_1 in room_3.
2. Go to room_2 (via room_1) and go in front of grey_box_1 while holding blue_ball_1 to satisfy constraint 6.
3. Go to room_4 (via room_2) and pick up grey_box_3 to satisfy constraint 7.
4. Go back to room_3 (via room_4) and go in front of blue_box_1 to satisfy the goal.

Let's write the actions step by step:

1. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_3
2. pick blue_ball_1 room_3
3. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_1
4. toggle blue_door_1
5. gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_1
6. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2
7. toggle purple_door_1
8. gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1
9. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_2  # Satisfy constraint 6 here
10. gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_4
11. toggle red_door_1
12. gotoroom room_2 room_4 red_door_1
13. gotoempty
14. drop blue_ball_1 room_4
15. gotoobject grey_box_3 room_4
16. pick grey_box_3 room_4  # Satisfy constraint 7, 1, 3, 4, and 5 here
17. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3
18. toggle grey_door_1
19. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1
20. gotoempty
21. drop grey_box_3 room_3
22. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_3  # Satisfy the goal here

I think I need to fix Steps 13-14. After I go to room_4, I drop blue_ball_1. But to drop blue_ball_1, I need to be in front of an empty position. So I added the "gotoempty" action.

Oh, wait. I realized an issue in my plan. At step 3, I go to the door while holding blue_ball_1. But the "toggle" action doesn't mention anything about whether I can toggle a door while holding an object.

Let me check the precondition for "toggle" again:
"toggle": you may only toggle a door d if you are in front of d.

It doesn't say anything about not being able to toggle a door while holding an object, so I assume I can toggle a door while holding an object. So the plan above should work.

Actually, let me count the actions of my plan again:
1. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_3
2. pick blue_ball_1 room_3
3. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_1
4. toggle blue_door_1
5. gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_1
6. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2
7. toggle purple_door_1
8. gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1
9. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_2  # Satisfy constraint 6 here
10. gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_4
11. toggle red_door_1
12. gotoroom room_2 room_4 red_door_1
13. gotoempty
14. drop blue_ball_1 room_4
15. gotoobject grey_box_3 room_4
16. pick grey_box_3 room_4  # Satisfy constraint 7, 1, 3, 4, and 5 here
17. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3
18. toggle grey_door_1
19. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1
20. gotoempty
21. drop grey_box_3 room_3
22. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_3  # Satisfy the goal here

That's 22 actions, and it seems to satisfy all constraints and the goal. I think this is optimal.

Actually, one more time to check:
1. Going in front of blue_ball_1 in room_3
2. Picking up blue_ball_1 in room_3
3. Going in front of blue_door_1 (connecting room_3 and room_1)
4. Toggling blue_door_1 (unlocking it)
5. Going from room_3 to room_1 via blue_door_1
6. Going in front of purple_door_1 (connecting room_1 and room_2)
7. Toggling purple_door_1 (unlocking it)
8. Going from room_1 to room_2 via purple_door_1
9. Going in front of grey_box_1 in room_2 (while holding blue_ball_1, satisfying constraint 6)
10. Going in front of red_door_1 (connecting room_2 and room_4)
11. Toggling red_door_1 (unlocking it)
12. Going from room_2 to room_4 via red_door_1
13. Going in front of an empty position in room_4
14. Dropping blue_ball_1 in room_4
15. Going in front of grey_box_3 in room_4
16. Picking up grey_box_3 in room_4 (satisfying constraint 7, 1, 3, 4, and 5)
17. Going in front of grey_door_1 (connecting room_4 and room_3)
18. Toggling grey_door_1 (unlocking it)
19. Going from room_4 to room_3 via grey_door_1
20. Going in front of an empty position in room_3
21. Dropping grey_box_3 in room_3
22. Going in front of blue_box_1 in room_3 (satisfying the goal)

And this is 22 steps as I thought.

Actually one more brief check. Let me make sure my actions are properly formatted:

1. "gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_3"
2. "pick blue_ball_1 room_3"
3. "gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_1"
4. "toggle blue_door_1"
5. "gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_1"
6. "gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2"
7. "toggle purple_door_1"
8. "gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1"
9. "gotoobject grey_box_1 room_2"
10. "gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_4"
11. "toggle red_door_1"
12. "gotoroom room_2 room_4 red_door_1"
13. "gotoempty"
14. "drop blue_ball_1 room_4"
15. "gotoobject grey_box_3 room_4"
16. "pick grey_box_3 room_4"
17. "gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3"
18. "toggle grey_door_1"
19. "gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1"
20. "gotoempty"
21. "drop grey_box_3 room_3"
22. "gotoobject blue_box_1 room_3"

Actually, wait. When I toggle a door, am I opening the door or unlocking it? Let me check the effect description for the "toggle" action again:

"toggle": After performing this action on a door d, (i) if d was locked, then it becomes unlocked, and (ii) if d was unlocked, then it becomes locked.

Ok, I am unlocking the door, not opening it, so that's correct.

Just to make sure I haven't missed any opportunity for optimization, is there any way I can reduce the number of steps?

Moving directly from picking up the blue_ball_1 to being in front of grey_box_1 would require going through room_1, but we need to unlock the doors first, so that doesn't help.

Similarly, moving directly from being in front of grey_box_1 to picking up grey_box_3 would require going through room_4, but we need to unlock the doors first.

I think the plan is optimal. I need to unlock the doors, pick up and move with objects, and satisfy the constraints in a specific order. The 22 steps I've outlined appear to be the most efficient way to do this.

Let me make sure my plan is correctly formatted and properly satisfies all constraints:

1. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_3
2. pick blue_ball_1 room_3 # Satisfies constraint 2, 3, 4, and 5
3. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_1
4. toggle blue_door_1
5. gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_1
6. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2
7. toggle purple_door_1
8. gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1
9. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_2 # Satisfies constraint 6 here
10. gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_4
11. toggle red_door_1
12. gotoroom room_2 room_4 red_door_1
13. gotoempty
14. drop blue_ball_1 room_4
15. gotoobject grey_box_3 room_4
16. pick grey_box_3 room_4 # Satisfies constraint 7 and 1 here
17. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3
18. toggle grey_door_1
19. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1
20. gotoempty
21. drop grey_box_3 room_3
22. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_3 # Satisfies the goal

The plan satisfies all the constraints and the goal, and I believe it's optimal. This is my final plan.
