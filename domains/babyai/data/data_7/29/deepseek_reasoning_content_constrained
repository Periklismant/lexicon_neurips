Okay, let's tackle this planning problem step by step. The goal is to have a blue box in front of the agent. The initial state is in room_3, and there are several constraints to satisfy along the way. Let me break it down.

First, the final goal: "There is a box v such that v is blue and you are in front of v." Looking at the objects, the blue boxes are blue_box_1 in room_3. So, the agent needs to be in front of blue_box_1 in room_3. But wait, blue_box_1 is already in room_3. So maybe the plan is to go to blue_box_1 and drop it? Wait, no. Wait, the agent needs to be in front of it. But if blue_box_1 is already in room_3, the agent can just gotoobject blue_box_1 room_3. But wait, the initial state says that in room_3, there are blue_ball_1, grey_box_2, blue_ball_2, and blue_box_1. So the agent is already in room_3. So maybe the simplest plan is to perform "gotoobject blue_box_1 room_3" and that's it. But wait, the preconditions for gotoobject are that the agent is in the same room as the object, which they are. So that action would achieve the goal. But wait, the problem is that the agent might not be in front of it yet. So the initial state doesn't mention the agent being in front of any object, so they need to move there.

But wait, the initial state says the agent is in room_3. The action "gotoobject blue_box_1 room_3" would require being in the same room as blue_box_1, which they are. Then after that action, the agent is in front of blue_box_1, which would satisfy the goal. But then why isn't the plan just one action? Because perhaps there are constraints that must be satisfied during the plan.

Looking at the constraints:

1. At least one state must have the agent holding grey_box_3 or green_box_1 in room_3. But green_box_1 is in room_2 initially, and grey_box_3 is in room_4. So to get green_box_1 to room_3, the agent needs to move it. But that would require unlocking doors. Similarly, grey_box_3 is in room_4. To hold it, the agent needs to go to room_4, pick it up.

But the final goal is in room_3. So perhaps the plan needs to involve moving between rooms, picking up objects, and fulfilling the constraints along the way.

Another constraint is that in some state, the agent is holding blue_ball_1 or is in front of purple_box_1. Since purple_box_1 is in room_1, which is connected via blue_door_1 (locked) to room_3. But the doors are all locked initially, so the agent can't go through them unless they unlock them. But to unlock a door, they need to toggle it, which requires being in front of it. But to get in front of a door, they need to go to the door in their current room. For example, in room_3, the doors are blue_door_1 (connecting to room_1) and grey_door_1 (connecting to room_4). Both are locked. So to unlock blue_door_1, the agent needs to gotoempty, then gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_1 (but is there an object blocking the door in room_3? The initial state in room_3 has blue_ball_1, grey_box_2, blue_ball_2, blue_box_1. The positions in front of doors might be blocked if those objects are there. So the preconditions for gotodoor require that there's no object blocking the position in front of the door in the current room. So if any of the objects in room_3 are in front of blue_door_1 or grey_door_1, then the agent can't go to the door unless they move those objects. But the problem statement doesn't specify the exact positions of objects in the room, just which room they are in. So perhaps the assumption is that the positions are not blocking the doors unless specified. Wait, but the problem's initial state doesn't mention any objects blocking doors. So maybe the doors are not blocked. So the agent can go to the door as long as they are in the room connected by the door.

Wait, the "gotodoor" action's preconditions are: (i) in a room connected by door d, and (ii) no object is blocking the position in front of d in the current room. Since the initial state doesn't mention any objects blocking doors, the agent can go to the doors. So for example, in room_3, the agent can go to blue_door_1 (connecting to room_1) and grey_door_1 (connecting to room_4).

But all doors are locked. So the agent can't go through them unless they are unlocked. So to get to room_4, they need to unlock grey_door_1. To do that, they need to toggle it, which requires being in front of it. So steps could be: gotoempty (to be in front of nothing), then gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4. Then toggle grey_door_1 to unlock it. Then gotoroom room_3 room_4 grey_door_1. Then in room_4, pick up grey_box_3. Then return to room_3, etc. But why would they need to do that? Because one of the constraints is that in some state, the agent is holding grey_box_3. So that's a required step.

Another constraint: in some state, the agent is holding blue_ball_1 or is in front of purple_box_1. Since purple_box_1 is in room_1, which is connected via blue_door_1 (locked). So unless the agent unlocks blue_door_1, they can't get to room_1. But to unlock blue_door_1, they need to be in front of it in room_3, toggle it. So steps would be gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_1, toggle it, then go to room_1, then gotoobject purple_box_1 room_1. That would satisfy the condition of being in front of purple_box_1. Alternatively, the agent could pick up blue_ball_1 in room_3, which is already there. So that's another way to satisfy that constraint. So maybe picking up blue_ball_1 would be easier.

Another constraint: the agent must be holding some object in at least two states (since there are two such constraints). Also, another constraint requires that in some state, the agent is holding some object OR holding green_box_1. But since green_box_1 is in room_2, which is connected via purple_door_1 (locked, in room_1 and room_2), but the agent starts in room_3. To get to room_2, the agent would need to go through room_1 or room_4. Room_2 is connected to room_4 via red_door_1 (locked). So to get to room_2, perhaps via room_4. But room_4 is connected to room_3 via grey_door_1 (locked). So the agent needs to unlock grey_door_1 first. Then go to room_4, then unlock red_door_1 (connecting room_4 to room_2), which is also locked. Then go to room_2, pick up green_box_1. But that seems complicated. Alternatively, maybe it's easier to go through room_1. But room_1 is connected to room_3 via blue_door_1 (locked). So the agent would have to unlock blue_door_1, go to room_1, then unlock purple_door_1 (connecting room_1 to room_2), then go to room_2. But that's a lot of steps.

Alternatively, maybe the agent can satisfy some constraints without needing to go to room_2. For example, the constraint that green_box_1 is in room_3. But how? The agent would have to move green_box_1 from room_2 to room_3. That requires picking it up in room_2 and bringing it to room_3, which involves unlocking doors. But that's a lot of steps.

But let's look at the constraints again:

1. At least one state must have: holding grey_box_3 OR green_box_1 in room_3.

So if the agent can get grey_box_3 into room_3, or bring green_box_1 into room_3, that would satisfy it. But moving grey_box_3 from room_4 to room_3 is possible. Since grey_box_3 is in room_4. To get there, the agent can unlock grey_door_1 (room_3 to room_4), go to room_4, pick up grey_box_3, bring it back to room_3, drop it. Then that would make green_box_1 in room_3? No, green_box_1 is in room_2. Wait, no. The constraint is that either the agent is holding grey_box_3, or green_box_1 is in room_3. So the agent could just hold grey_box_3 at some point, which is in room_4. So steps: go to room_4, pick up grey_box_3, then drop it somewhere else. That would satisfy the first constraint.

Another constraint: in some state, the agent is holding blue_ball_1 or in front of purple_box_1. Since blue_ball_1 is in room_3, the agent can pick it up, which satisfies the condition. So that's easier. So pick up blue_ball_1, then drop it later.

Another constraint: in some state, the agent is holding some object. This needs to happen at least two times. Well, if the agent picks up and drops an object, that would count as two states where they are holding something (during the pick and before the drop). Wait, but the action "pick" makes the agent hold the object, and "drop" makes them not hold it. So during the time between pick and drop, the agent is holding the object. So each time they pick up an object, that's a state where they are holding something. So if they pick up two different objects, or the same one twice, that would satisfy multiple constraints.

Another constraint: in some state, the agent is holding some object OR holding green_box_1. Since holding some object is part of the OR, this can be satisfied by holding any object, including blue_ball_1 or grey_box_3.

Another constraint: in some state, the agent is holding blue_ball_1 and is in front of grey_box_1. But grey_box_1 is in room_2. So to be in front of grey_box_1, the agent must be in room_2. So they have to go to room_2, which requires unlocking doors. So this is a tricky constraint. Because the agent needs to be in room_2, in front of grey_box_1, while holding blue_ball_1. But blue_ball_1 starts in room_3. So the agent would have to pick up blue_ball_1 in room_3, carry it through to room_2, and then be in front of grey_box_1 while holding it. But how to get to room_2 from room_3? Let's think about the possible paths.

From room_3, the doors are blue_door_1 (room_1) and grey_door_1 (room_4). To get to room_2, possible paths:

Option 1: room_3 -> room_1 via blue_door_1 (unlock it), then room_1 -> room_2 via purple_door_1 (unlock it). Then in room_2, go to grey_box_1.

Option 2: room_3 -> room_4 via grey_door_1 (unlock), then room_4 -> room_2 via red_door_1 (unlock). Then in room_2, go to grey_box_1.

Which path is shorter? Let's count the steps.

Option 1:

1. Unlock blue_door_1:

   - gotoempty in room_3

   - gotodoor blue_door_1 room3 room1

   - toggle blue_door_1 (unlocks it)

2. goto room1 from room3 via blue_door_1

3. unlock purple_door_1 (connecting room1 and room2):

   - gotoempty in room1

   - gotodoor purple_door_1 room1 room2

   - toggle purple_door_1

4. goto room2 from room1 via purple_door_1

5. in room2, gotoobject grey_box_1

But the agent needs to be holding blue_ball_1 while in front of grey_box_1. So they must have picked up blue_ball_1 in room3, then carried it through the doors. So steps would be:

After step 1, before going to room1:

   - gotoobject blue_ball_1 room3

   - pick blue_ball_1 room3

Then proceed to room1, room2, etc. But doors need to be unlocked. Also, when moving between rooms, the agent is no longer in front of any object. So after picking up blue_ball_1, they need to carry it to room2.

But this seems like a long path. Let's outline the steps:

1. In room3:

   - gotoempty

   - gotodoor blue_door_1 room3 room1

   - toggle blue_door_1 (unlock)

   - gotoroom room3 room1 blue_door_1

2. In room1:

   - gotoempty

   - gotodoor purple_door_1 room1 room2

   - toggle purple_door_1 (unlock)

   - gotoroom room1 room2 purple_door_1

3. In room2:

   - gotoobject grey_box_1 room2

   At this point, the agent is in front of grey_box_1 but not holding blue_ball_1. So they need to have picked up blue_ball_1 in room3, then carried it through to room2.

So let's adjust:

1. In room3:

   - gotoobject blue_ball_1 room3

   - pick blue_ball_1 room3 (now holding it)

   - gotoempty (maybe not necessary)

   - gotodoor blue_door_1 room3 room1

   - toggle blue_door_1 (unlock)

   - gotoroom room3 room1 blue_door_1 (now in room1, holding blue_ball_1)

2. In room1:

   - gotodoor purple_door_1 room1 room2

   - toggle purple_door_1 (unlock)

   - gotoroom room1 room2 purple_door_1

3. In room2:

   - gotoobject grey_box_1 room2 (now in front of grey_box_1, holding blue_ball_1)

This satisfies the constraint where the agent is holding blue_ball_1 and in front of grey_box_1. But after that, they need to drop the ball or box, but the final goal is to have a blue box in front. So after satisfying that constraint, they need to proceed to drop the ball, then maybe go back to room3 to handle the blue_box_1.

But this seems like a lot of steps, and maybe the optimal plan can be shorter. Let's see.

Alternatively, maybe the agent can satisfy multiple constraints with minimal steps. Let's outline the necessary steps:

Final goal: be in front of blue_box_1 in room3.

Constraints:

- Must hold grey_box_3 at some point.

- Must hold blue_ball_1 or be in front of purple_box_1.

- Must hold some object in at least two states.

- Must hold some object or green_box_1.

- Must hold blue_ball_1 and be in front of grey_box_1.

- Must hold grey_box_3.

So the agent must:

1. At some point hold grey_box_3.

2. At some point hold blue_ball_1 and be in front of grey_box_1 (which is in room2).

3. Also, the other constraints about holding objects.

So perhaps the plan involves:

- Picking up blue_ball_1 in room3.

- Then moving to room2 via room1, unlocking doors along the way.

- In room2, go to grey_box_1 while holding blue_ball_1 (satisfying that constraint).

- Then, drop blue_ball_1, pick up green_box_1, bring it to room3 (but need to unlock doors again? Or maybe not, if already unlocked).

- Also, need to go to room4 to get grey_box_3, which is another path.

This is getting complicated. Let's see if there's a shorter path.

Alternatively, the agent can:

1. In room3, pick up blue_ball_1. This satisfies the constraint of holding some object (twice, as there are two such constraints). Also, this action would satisfy the constraint of holding blue_ball_1 or being in front of purple_box_1.

But wait, the constraint is that in some state, either hold blue_ball_1 or be in front of purple_box_1. So if the agent picks up blue_ball_1, that satisfies that constraint.

Then, the agent needs to be in front of grey_box_1 while holding blue_ball_1. So they need to get to room2. How?

But room2 is connected to room4 via red_door_1 (locked), and to room1 via purple_door_1 (locked). So to get to room2, the agent needs to unlock either the purple_door_1 (from room1) or red_door_1 (from room4).

The agent starts in room3. To get to room4, unlock grey_door_1 (room3 to room4):

Steps:

1. In room3:

   - gotoempty

   - gotodoor grey_door_1 room3 room4

   - toggle grey_door_1 (unlocks it)

   - gotoroom room3 room4 grey_door_1

Now in room4. Then, from room4, unlock red_door_1 (connecting to room2):

2. In room4:

   - gotoempty

   - gotodoor red_door_1 room4 room2

   - toggle red_door_1 (unlock)

   - gotoroom room4 room2 red_door_1

Now in room2. Then:

3. In room2:

   - gotoobject grey_box_1 room2

   - At this point, the agent is in front of grey_box_1. But they need to be holding blue_ball_1 here. So they must have brought blue_ball_1 from room3 to room2. But to do that, the agent would need to carry it through room3 -> room4 -> room2. But to do that, they need to pick up blue_ball_1 in room3, then go to room4, then to room2.

But wait, after picking up blue_ball_1 in room3, the agent needs to go to room4, which requires going through grey_door_1. So:

Alternative steps:

1. In room3:

   - gotoobject blue_ball_1 room3

   - pick blue_ball_1 room3 (now holding it)

2. gotoempty

3. gotodoor grey_door_1 room3 room4

4. toggle grey_door_1 (unlock)

5. gotoroom room3 room4 grey_door_1 (now in room4, holding blue_ball_1)

6. In room4:

   - gotoempty

   - gotodoor red_door_1 room4 room2

   - toggle red_door_1 (unlock)

   - gotoroom room4 room2 red_door_1 (now in room2, holding blue_ball_1)

7. In room2:

   - gotoobject grey_box_1 room2 (now in front of grey_box_1, holding blue_ball_1) → satisfies the constraint.

8. drop blue_ball_1 room2 (optional, but maybe needed to free hands)

Then, need to get grey_box_3 from room4. So:

9. gotoroom room2 room4 red_door_1 (back to room4)

10. In room4:

    - gotoobject grey_box_3 room4

    - pick grey_box_3 room4 (now holding it, which satisfies the constraint of holding grey_box_3 and also the other constraints about holding some object)

11. Then, return to room3 via grey_door_1 (which is already unlocked):

    - gotoempty

    - gotodoor grey_door_1 room4 room3

    - toggle grey_door_1 (lock it again? No, but the action toggles it. Wait, but the initial state is locked. After toggling once, it's unlocked. Toggling again would lock it. So if the agent toggled it once in step 4, it's unlocked. So they can go back through without toggling again, as long as it's still unlocked.

Wait, after step 4, the door was unlocked. When the agent moves from room3 to room4, the door remains unlocked unless toggled again. So when they go back from room4 to room3, they can just use the door as it's already unlocked.

So steps 9 onwards:

9. In room4, after picking grey_box_3:

   - gotoroom room4 room3 grey_door_1 (back to room3)

10. In room3:

    - drop grey_box_3 room3 (now grey_box_3 is in room3, which satisfies the constraint of green_box_1 being in room3 or holding grey_box_3. But since we've held grey_box_3, that's already satisfied)

11. Now, the agent needs to be in front of a blue box. blue_box_1 is in room3. So:

    - gotoobject blue_box_1 room3

This would achieve the final goal.

But let's check all constraints:

- Constraint 1: At least one state where holding grey_box_3 OR green_box_1 in room3. We have held grey_box_3, so this is satisfied.

- Constraint 2: At least one state where holding blue_ball_1 OR in front of purple_box_1. We held blue_ball_1, so satisfied.

- Constraints 3 and 4: At least two states where holding some object. We held blue_ball_1 and grey_box_3, so two states.

- Constraint 5: Holding some object OR green_box_1. We held some object, so satisfied.

- Constraint 6: Holding blue_ball_1 and in front of grey_box_1. Achieved in step 7.

- Constraint 7: Holding grey_box_3. Achieved in step 10 (when picked up).

So all constraints are satisfied.

Now, let's count the steps:

1. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room3

2. pick blue_ball_1 room3

3. gotoempty

4. gotodoor grey_door_1 room3 room4

5. toggle grey_door_1

6. gotoroom room3 room4 grey_door_1

7. gotoempty

8. gotodoor red_door_1 room4 room2

9. toggle red_door_1

10. gotoroom room4 room2 red_door_1

11. gotoobject grey_box_1 room2

12. drop blue_ball_1 room2

13. gotoroom room2 room4 red_door_1

14. gotoobject grey_box_3 room4

15. pick grey_box_3 room4

16. gotoroom room4 room3 grey_door_1

17. gotoobject blue_box_1 room3

But wait, step 12 is optional unless the agent needs to drop to perform other actions. But since after step 11, they are holding blue_ball_1 and in front of grey_box_1. Then, to move to room4, they need to go to the door. But they can't carry objects while moving through doors? Wait, the action "gotoroom" doesn't mention dropping objects. So the agent can carry objects through doors. So after step 11, the agent is in room2, holding blue_ball_1. They need to go to room4. So:

- gotoempty in room2 (to leave front of grey_box_1)

- gotodoor red_door_1 room2 room4 (but the door is already unlocked)

- gotoroom room2 room4 red_door_1 (now in room4, still holding blue_ball_1)

But then, to pick up grey_box_3, the agent needs to drop blue_ball_1 first (since they can only hold one object). So:

- drop blue_ball_1 room4

- then pick up grey_box_3

But this adds steps. Alternatively, maybe the agent can drop blue_ball_1 in room2 before leaving. Let's see:

After step 11, the agent is in room2, in front of grey_box_1, holding blue_ball_1.

Then:

12. drop blue_ball_1 room2 (now not holding anything)

13. gotoroom room2 room4 red_door_1

14. In room4:

    - gotoobject grey_box_3 room4

    - pick grey_box_3 room4

15. gotoroom room4 room3 grey_door_1

16. gotoobject blue_box_1 room3

But this way, the agent has to drop the ball, which requires another action.

Alternatively, perhaps they can carry the ball to room4, drop it there, then pick up grey_box_3.

But this adds steps. Alternatively, maybe after step 11, the agent can just keep holding the ball and go back to room4, but then they can't pick up grey_box_3 without dropping the ball first. So steps would be:

After step 11:

12. gotoempty (to leave front of grey_box_1)

13. gotodoor red_door_1 room2 room4

14. gotoroom room2 room4 red_door_1 (now in room4, holding blue_ball_1)

15. drop blue_ball_1 room4

16. gotoobject grey_box_3 room4

17. pick grey_box_3 room4

18. gotoroom room4 room3 grey_door_1

19. gotoobject blue_box_1 room3

So this adds more steps. The optimal plan would require minimizing the number of actions. Let's see if there's a way to combine steps.

Alternatively, after step 11 (in room2, front of grey_box_1, holding blue_ball_1), the agent can drop the ball there, then proceed to room4 to pick up grey_box_3. Then return to room3.

But then the steps would be:

12. drop blue_ball_1 room2

13. gotoroom room2 room4 red_door_1

14. gotoobject grey_box_3 room4

15. pick grey_box_3 room4

16. gotoroom room4 room3 grey_door_1

17. gotoobject blue_box_1 room3

This is 17 actions. But maybe there's a shorter way.

Wait, but the final goal is to be in front of blue_box_1. So after step 17, that's achieved.

But let's count the steps from the initial plan:

1. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room3 → 1

2. pick → 2

3. gotoempty →3

4. gotodoor grey_door_1 →4

5. toggle →5

6. gotoroom →6

7. gotoempty →7

8. gotodoor red_door_1 →8

9. toggle →9

10. gotoroom →10

11. gotoobject grey_box_1 →11

12. drop →12

13. gotoroom →13

14. gotoobject grey_box_3 →14

15. pick →15

16. gotoroom →16

17. gotoobject blue_box_1 →17

That's 17 actions. But maybe some steps can be optimized. For example, after picking up blue_ball_1, maybe the agent doesn't need to gotoempty before going to the door. Because after picking, the agent is no longer in front of the object. Wait, the effect of "pick" is that the agent is no longer in front of x. So after picking, the agent is in the same room but not in front of any object. So to go to the door, they can directly go to the door without needing to gotoempty.

So step 3 (gotoempty) may not be necessary. Let's check:

After step 2 (pick), the agent is no longer in front of blue_ball_1. So they can directly do gotodoor grey_door_1 room3 room4. The precondition for gotodoor is that there's no object blocking the door. Assuming that's true, they can go to the door without needing to gotoempty first.

So revised steps:

1. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room3

2. pick blue_ball_1 room3

3. gotodoor grey_door_1 room3 room4

4. toggle grey_door_1

5. gotoroom room3 room4 grey_door_1

6. gotodoor red_door_1 room4 room2

7. toggle red_door_1

8. gotoroom room4 room2 red_door_1

9. gotoobject grey_box_1 room2

10. drop blue_ball_1 room2

11. gotoroom room2 room4 red_door_1

12. gotoobject grey_box_3 room4

13. pick grey_box_3 room4

14. gotoroom room4 room3 grey_door_1

15. gotoobject blue_box_1 room3

Now that's 15 steps. Let's check if each step is valid.

Step 1: gotoobject blue_ball_1 room3 → valid, agent is in room3.

Step 2: pick → valid, agent is in room3 and not holding anything.

Step 3: gotodoor grey_door_1 room3 room4 → valid, agent is in room3, which is connected via grey_door_1, and no object blocks the door.

Step 4: toggle → valid, agent is in front of grey_door_1.

Step 5: gotoroom to room4 → valid, door is now unlocked.

Step 6: gotodoor red_door_1 room4 room2 → valid, agent is in room4, connected via red_door_1, no blocking.

Step 7: toggle → valid, in front of red_door_1.

Step 8: gotoroom to room2 → valid, door unlocked.

Step 9: gotoobject grey_box_1 room2 → valid, agent in room2.

Step 10: drop blue_ball_1 room2 → valid, agent is holding it, and in room2.

Step 11: gotoroom to room4 → valid.

Step 12: gotoobject grey_box_3 room4 → valid.

Step 13: pick → valid.

Step 14: gotoroom to room3 → valid, door is unlocked.

Step 15: gotoobject blue_box_1 room3 → valid.

This reduces steps from 17 to 15. Further optimizations?

After step 10 (drop in room2), agent is in room2. To get to room4, they need to go back through red_door_1. So step 11: gotoroom room2 room4 red_door_1. Then step 12: gotoobject grey_box_3 room4.

But after step 8, the agent is in room2. Then steps 9-11 are:

9. gotoobject grey_box_1 room2

10. drop blue_ball_1 room2

11. gotoroom room2 room4 red_door_1

Is step 11 valid? Yes, the door is unlocked.

But maybe after step 8, the agent is in room2. Then they can go to grey_box_1, drop the ball, then go back to room4.

Alternatively, can the agent go from room2 to room4 without needing to drop the ball? No, because they need to hold grey_box_3 later, which requires picking it up. But if they are holding blue_ball_1, they can't pick up grey_box_3 until they drop it.

But in this plan, after dropping blue_ball_1 in room2, the agent is free to pick up grey_box_3 in room4.

Another possible optimization: after picking grey_box_3 in room4, can the agent go directly back to room3, and then goto blue_box_1. Yes.

So the steps seem valid. Now, check all constraints:

- Hold grey_box_3: step 13.

- Hold blue_ball_1 and in front of grey_box_1: steps 2-9.

- Holding some object in steps 2-10 (blue_ball_1) and step 13-14 (grey_box_3). So two separate states.

- The constraint requiring holding some object or green_box_1 is satisfied by holding some object.

- The constraint requiring holding grey_box_3 is satisfied.

All other constraints are covered.

Now, the final goal is to be in front of a blue box. blue_box_1 is in room3. So step 15 achieves that.

So the final plan is 15 steps. Is there a shorter way?

What if the agent doesn't need to drop blue_ball_1 in room2 but instead drops it in room4? Let's see:

After step 8 (in room2), steps could be:

9. gotoobject grey_box_1 room2

10. gotoroom room2 room4 red_door_1 (still holding blue_ball_1)

11. drop blue_ball_1 room4

12. gotoobject grey_box_3 room4

13. pick grey_box_3 room4

14. gotoroom room4 room3 grey_door_1

15. gotoobject blue_box_1 room3

This is 15 steps again. No difference.

Alternatively, after step 9 (in front of grey_box_1, holding blue_ball_1), the agent can proceed to drop it there, then leave.

But regardless, the number of steps remains similar.

Is there a way to avoid going to room2? Because the constraint requires being in front of grey_box_1 while holding blue_ball_1. Since grey_box_1 is in room2, the agent must go there. So that part is unavoidable.

Thus, the minimal plan length is likely around 15 steps. But perhaps there's a smarter way.

Wait, the agent could pick up blue_box_1 directly in room3, but the goal is to be in front of it, not necessarily to drop it. So if the agent is already in front of blue_box_1, that's the goal. So perhaps the agent can achieve the goal without needing to move grey_box_3 or do all those steps. But the constraints require that certain actions are done, so the agent must perform those steps regardless of the final goal.

Wait, the final goal is just to have a blue box in front, but the constraints require various other things. So the agent must satisfy all constraints along the way, even if the final goal is simple.

So even though the final goal is achievable with one action (gotoobject blue_box_1 room3), the constraints require additional steps. For example, the agent must hold grey_box_3 at some point, which requires going to room4. So the plan must include those steps.

Therefore, the minimal plan must include all necessary actions to satisfy the constraints and achieve the goal.

Another angle: the agent can pick up blue_box_1 in room3, which is blue, and then drop it again. But that would require carrying it. However, the final goal is to be in front of it, so dropping it may not be necessary. But if the agent is already in front of it after dropping, that's okay. Wait, when you drop an object, you are in front of it. So perhaps:

1. gotoobject blue_box_1 room3

2. pick blue_box_1 room3

3. drop blue_box_1 room3

Now, after dropping, the agent is in front of blue_box_1. So the goal is achieved. But this ignores all the constraints. The constraints are not part of the final goal but must be satisfied in at least one state along the plan.

So even if the agent achieves the goal in three steps, they need to have satisfied all constraints during the plan. Let's check:

The constraints are:

1. At least one state with holding grey_box_3 OR green_box_1 in room3. But in this plan, the agent never handles grey_box_3 or green_box_1. So this constraint is not met.

Thus, this plan is invalid. Hence, the agent must perform the longer plan to meet all constraints.

Therefore, the minimal valid plan is the one that satisfies all constraints while achieving the goal. The steps outlined earlier are necessary.

But perhaps there's a shorter path. For example, after step 13 (picking grey_box_3), the agent can drop it in room3, then gotoobject blue_box_1. So steps:

13. pick grey_box_3 room4

14. gotoroom room4 room3 grey_door_1

15. drop grey_box_3 room3

16. gotoobject blue_box_1 room3

This adds one more step. But the agent needs to drop grey_box_3 to free hands? No, the final goal doesn't require holding anything, just being in front. So the agent can be holding grey_box_3 and be in front of blue_box_1. Wait, but to be in front of blue_box_1, they need to gotoobject, which requires being in the same room and not holding anything? No, the precondition for gotoobject is that the agent is in the same room as the object. Holding an object doesn't affect that. So the agent can be holding grey_box_3 and gotoobject blue_box_1 in room3. So step 14:

14. gotoroom room4 room3 grey_door_1

15. gotoobject blue_box_1 room3

This would achieve the goal while holding grey_box_3. So the plan would be shorter:

1. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room3

2. pick blue_ball_1 room3

3. gotodoor grey_door_1 room3 room4

4. toggle grey_door_1

5. gotoroom room3 room4 grey_door_1

6. gotodoor red_door_1 room4 room2

7. toggle red_door_1

8. gotoroom room4 room2 red_door_1

9. gotoobject grey_box_1 room2

10. drop blue_ball_1 room2

11. gotoroom room2 room4 red_door_1

12. gotoobject grey_box_3 room4

13. pick grey_box_3 room4

14. gotoroom room4 room3 grey_door_1

15. gotoobject blue_box_1 room3

Now, steps 1-15. This satisfies all constraints:

- Holding grey_box_3 in step13.

- Holding blue_ball_1 from step2 to step10.

- In step9, holding blue_ball_1 and in front of grey_box_1.

- The other constraints about holding objects are covered.

So this is 15 steps. Is there a way to reduce this?

What if the agent, after picking grey_box_3 in room4 (step13), goes directly to room3 and then to blue_box_1 without dropping anything. So steps:

13. pick grey_box_3 room4

14. gotoroom room4 room3 grey_door_1

15. gotoobject blue_box_1 room3

This works, and the agent is holding grey_box_3 when they gotoobject blue_box_1. There's no precondition that requires the agent to not be holding an object to gotoobject. So this is valid. Thus, the steps are:

1. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room3

2. pick blue_ball_1 room3

3. gotodoor grey_door_1 room3 room4

4. toggle grey_door_1

5. gotoroom room3 room4 grey_door_1

6. gotodoor red_door_1 room4 room2

7. toggle red_door_1

8. gotoroom room4 room2 red_door_1

9. gotoobject grey_box_1 room2

10. drop blue_ball_1 room2

11. gotoroom room2 room4 red_door_1

12. gotoobject grey_box_3 room4

13. pick grey_box_3 room4

14. gotoroom room4 room3 grey_door_1

15. gotoobject blue_box_1 room3

15 steps. This seems to be the minimal plan.

Now, let's verify each action's preconditions and effects.

Step 1: gotoobject blue_ball_1 room3. Preconditions: agent is in room3. Yes. Effects: in front of blue_ball_1.

Step 2: pick blue_ball_1 room3. Pre: in room3, not holding anything. Yes. Effects: holding blue_ball_1.

Step3: gotodoor grey_door_1 room3 room4. Pre: agent is in room3 (yes), door connects to room4 (yes), no object blocking. Assuming yes. Effects: in front of grey_door_1.

Step4: toggle grey_door_1. Pre: in front of it. Yes. Effects: unlock.

Step5: gotoroom room3 room4 grey_door_1. Pre: door is unlocked (yes). Effects: now in room4.

Step6: gotodoor red_door_1 room4 room2. Pre: in room4, door connects to room2. Yes. No blocking. Effects: in front of red_door_1.

Step7: toggle red_door_1. Unlocks it.

Step8: gotoroom room4 room2 red_door_1. Now in room2.

Step9: gotoobject grey_box_1 room2. Pre: in room2. Yes. Now in front of grey_box_1, holding blue_ball_1. This satisfies the constraint.

Step10: drop blue_ball_1 room2. Pre: holding it, in room2. Yes. Drops it.

Step11: gotoroom room2 room4 red_door_1. Door is unlocked. Now in room4.

Step12: gotoobject grey_box_3 room4. Pre: in room4. Yes.

Step13: pick grey_box_3 room4. Pre: not holding anything (after dropping blue_ball_1). Yes.

Step14: gotoroom room4 room3 grey_door_1. Door is unlocked. Now in room3.

Step15: gotoobject blue_box_1 room3. Pre: in room3. Yes. Now in front of blue_box_1, which is blue. Goal achieved.

All constraints are satisfied:

- Holding grey_box_3 (step13).

- Holding blue_ball_1 (steps2-10).

- In front of grey_box_1 while holding blue_ball_1 (step9).

- Etc.

This seems to be a valid and optimal plan. I don't see any unnecessary steps. Therefore, this should be the correct answer.
