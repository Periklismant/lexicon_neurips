Okay, let's try to figure out how to solve this planning problem. The goal is to have a grey ball that I'm holding while being in room_2. Let me start by understanding the initial state and the constraints.

First, the initial state: I'm in room_4. The grey_ball_1 is in room_2. All doors are locked. The doors are purple_door_1 (connects room_1 and 2), red_door_1 (room_1 and 3), blue_door_1 (room_2 and 4), and green_door_1 (room_3 and 4). So, to get from room_4 to room_2, I need to go through blue_door_1, which is locked. Alternatively, maybe through green_door_1 to room_3, then red_door_1 to room_1, then purple_door_1 to room_2. But all doors are locked, so I need to unlock them.

Wait, but to unlock a door, I have to toggle it. But to toggle a door, I need to be in front of it. So, first, I need to get to the door, unlock it, then go through. But doors are locked, so the path is blocked until I unlock them.

Since the grey_ball_1 is in room_2, I need to get there. Let's see the possible paths from room_4:

Option 1: Go from room_4 to room_2 via blue_door_1. But blue_door_1 is locked. So, I need to unlock it. But to unlock blue_door_1, I need to be in front of it. Since I'm in room_4, blue_door_1 connects room_2 and 4. So, in room_4, can I go to blue_door_1? The door connects room_4 and 2. So, in room_4, blue_door_1 is present. Wait, the doors are two-way. So, in room_4, the doors connecting to it are blue_door_1 (to room_2) and green_door_1 (to room_3). So, in room_4, I can go to blue_door_1. But the preconditions for "gotodoor d r1 r2" are that I'm in a room connected by door d, and there's no object blocking the position in front of d in my current room. Are there any objects blocking doors in room_4?

In room_4, there's grey_box_1 and blue_box_2. Are they blocking doors? The problem says that objects can block doors. Wait, the "effects" of picking up an object include that if the object was blocking a door, it's no longer blocking. So, initially, are any objects blocking doors? The initial state doesn't mention any door being blocked, so maybe none are blocked. So, the doors are not blocked by objects. Therefore, I can go to blue_door_1 in room_4.

So steps could be:

1. gotoempty in room_4 (to move to an empty position, but maybe not necessary if I can go directly to the door)

Wait, the initial position is room_4. To go to the door, I need to use "gotodoor blue_door_1 room_4 room_2". Wait, no, the action is "gotodoor d r1 r2" where d is the door, and r1 and r2 are the connected rooms. So, since I'm in room_4, which is connected via blue_door_1 to room_2, I can do "gotodoor blue_door_1 room_4 room_2". Then, toggle blue_door_1 to unlock it. Then, gotoroom room_4 room_2 blue_door_1. Once in room_2, go to the grey_ball_1, pick it up, and that's the goal.

Wait, but in room_2, the grey_ball_1 is present. But to pick it up, I need to be in front of it. So, after entering room_2 via blue_door_1, I need to "gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_2", then "pick grey_ball_1 room_2".

But let's check if all steps are possible.

Starting in room_4:

1. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_4 room_2: Preconditions: I'm in room_4 (yes), and door blue_door_1 connects room_4 and 2 (yes). No object blocking the position in front of the door in room_4. Since initial state doesn't mention any objects blocking doors, so yes. So this action is possible.

Effect: Now in front of blue_door_1.

2. toggle blue_door_1: Since I'm in front of it, this is allowed. Toggle will unlock it (since it was locked). Now blue_door_1 is unlocked.

3. gotoroom room_4 room_2 blue_door_1: Preconditions: current room is room_4 (yes), adjacent to room_2 via blue_door_1 (yes), door is unlocked (now yes). So this action moves me to room_2.

Now in room_2. Need to go to grey_ball_1.

4. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_2: Precondition: in same room as the object (yes, now in room_2). So possible.

Effect: Now in front of grey_ball_1.

5. pick grey_ball_1 room_2: Preconditions: in same room, not holding anything (yes). So pick up the ball.

Now, the goal is achieved: holding a grey ball (grey_ball_1) in room_2.

Wait, but let's check if any constraints are violated. The problem mentions constraints, but in the user's message, after the original problem description, the constraints section is empty. Wait, looking back: "A valid plan for the abovementioned problem must abide by the following constraints:" followed by nothing. So maybe there are no additional constraints beyond the preconditions. So the above plan should work.

But wait, let's check the doors again. After toggling blue_door_1, it's unlocked, so we can pass through. Then, moving to room_2. Then accessing the grey_ball_1.

But let's verify the initial positions. The grey_ball_1 is indeed in room_2. So yes.

So the steps would be:

1. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_4 room_2

2. toggle blue_door_1

3. gotoroom room_4 room_2 blue_door_1

4. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_2

5. pick grey_ball_1 room_2

But wait, when moving to room_2, the effect is that you are no longer in front of any object. So after step 3, I'm in room_2 but not in front of anything. Then step 4: gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_2, which requires being in the same room. That's correct.

But in step 3, after moving to room_2, I'm not in front of any door or object. Then, step 4: gotoobject, which moves me in front of the ball. Then pick.

This seems correct. But are there any objects blocking doors in room_2 that would prevent me from going to the ball? For example, is the blue_box_1 or grey_ball_1 blocking a door? Since the initial state doesn't mention any door being blocked, and objects are in their rooms but not necessarily blocking doors. So assuming that they are placed such that the path is clear.

So this plan should work. Let's count the steps: 5 actions. Is there a shorter way? Let's see.

Alternative approach: Maybe after unlocking the door, can I pick the ball in fewer steps?

Wait, when I'm in room_4, if I can unlock the door, go to room_2, then pick the ball. That's exactly what the plan does. So 5 steps. Is there a way to do it in fewer? Let's see.

Suppose after step 3 (gotoroom to room_2), I can pick the ball immediately. But to pick, I need to be in front of the ball. So unless I'm already in front of the ball after entering room_2, which I'm not. The effect of gotoroom is that you are no longer in front of anything. So I must gotoobject to be in front of the ball. So the steps are necessary.

So the plan is optimal with 5 steps.
