Let me break down this complex gridworld planning problem step by step:

### Initial Understanding

We have a 4-room gridworld arranged in a square:
- room_1 (northwest)
- room_2 (southwest)
- room_3 (northeast)
- room_4 (southeast)

There are 4 doors connecting:
- purple_door_1: room_1-room_2
- red_door_1: room_1-room_3
- blue_door_1: room_2-room_4
- green_door_1: room_3-room_4

All doors start locked.

Objects in each room:
- room_1: green_box_1, yellow_box_1
- room_2: blue_box_1, grey_ball_1
- room_3: green_box_2, purple_box_1
- room_4: grey_box_1, blue_box_2

The goal is: hold grey_ball_1 and be in room_2.

### Constraints Analysis

Let me analyze the constraints one by one:

1. Must hold an object at some point
2. Before holding an object, either grey_ball_1 must be in room_4 OR we must be in room_1
3. green_door_1 must be unlocked at some point
4. blue_door_1 must always stay locked
5. At some point, either red_door_1 is unlocked OR we hold green_box_1
6. We must be in room_4 at some point
7. After being in room_4, green_door_1 must be unlocked and blue_door_1 must be locked
8. We must be in room_2 at some point
9. Before being in room_2, we must hold some object
10. We must be in front of red_door_1 at some point

### Initial Situation

- We start in room_4
- All doors are locked
- grey_ball_1 (our goal object) is in room_2
- We need to get to room_2 while holding grey_ball_1

### Planning the Path

Since we need to end up in room_2 with grey_ball_1, and grey_ball_1 is already in room_2, we need to:
1. Find a path to room_2
2. Pick up grey_ball_1

Given that all doors are locked and we need to respect the constraints, let's think about the routes:

Current location: room_4
To reach room_2, we could go:
- room_4 → room_2 using blue_door_1 (BUT constraint says blue_door_1 must always stay locked)
- room_4 → room_3 → room_1 → room_2 (using green_door_1, red_door_1, purple_door_1)

This second path seems feasible if we can unlock green_door_1, red_door_1, and purple_door_1.

Let's plan step by step considering all constraints:

1. We're in room_4, and constraint #7 says we need to unlock green_door_1 (and keep blue_door_1 locked)
2. So first, we need to go to green_door_1 and unlock it
3. Then go to room_3
4. From room_3, we need to go to room_1 via red_door_1, but we need to unlock it first
5. Constraint #5 says we either need to unlock red_door_1 OR hold green_box_1
   - If we unlock red_door_1, we can proceed
   - If we hold green_box_1, we need to pick it up in room_1, but we can't get to room_1 without going through red_door_1
   - This means we must unlock red_door_1
6. From room_1, we need to go to room_2 via purple_door_1, which we need to unlock
7. Constraint #9 says before entering room_2, we must be holding some object
8. Constraint #2 says before holding an object, either grey_ball_1 must be in room_4 OR we must be in room_1
   - grey_ball_1 starts in room_2, not room_4
   - This means we need to be in room_1 before picking up an object
   - So we need to move to room_1, pick up an object there (maybe green_box_1 or yellow_box_1)
   - Then go to room_2 and swap it for grey_ball_1

Let's trace the plan:

1. In room_4:
   - gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3
   - toggle green_door_1 (unlock it)
   - gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1

2. In room_3:
   - gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1
   - toggle red_door_1 (unlock it)
   - gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1

3. In room_1:
   - gotoobject green_box_1 room_1
   - pick green_box_1 room_1
   - gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2
   - toggle purple_door_1 (unlock it)
   - gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1

4. In room_2:
   - gotoempty (to create space to drop green_box_1)
   - drop green_box_1 room_2
   - gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_2
   - pick grey_ball_1 room_2

Wait, there's a problem with this plan. Constraint #10 says we must be in front of red_door_1 at some point, which my plan includes. However, constraint #2 says before holding an object, either grey_ball_1 must be in room_4 OR we must be in room_1. In my plan, we pick up green_box_1 in room_1, which satisfies this constraint.

Let me double-check this plan against all constraints:

1. ✓ We hold an object (green_box_1 first, then grey_ball_1)
2. ✓ Before holding green_box_1, we are in room_1
3. ✓ green_door_1 is unlocked
4. ✓ blue_door_1 remains locked throughout
5. ✓ red_door_1 is unlocked
6. ✓ We start in room_4
7. ✓ After being in room_4, we unlock green_door_1 while blue_door_1 remains locked
8. ✓ We end up in room_2
9. ✓ Before being in room_2, we are holding green_box_1
10. ✓ We are in front of red_door_1 when we toggle it

This plan seems to satisfy all constraints. Let's write out the full sequence of actions:

Actually, let me review the constraints once more to be sure:

1. Must hold an object at some point
   - We hold green_box_1 and then grey_ball_1 ✓
2. Before holding an object, either grey_ball_1 must be in room_4 OR we must be in room_1
   - Before holding green_box_1, we are in room_1 ✓
3. green_door_1 must be unlocked at some point
   - We unlock green_door_1 ✓
4. blue_door_1 must always stay locked
   - blue_door_1 remains locked throughout ✓
5. At some point, either red_door_1 is unlocked OR we hold green_box_1
   - We unlock red_door_1 ✓
6. We must be in room_4 at some point
   - We start in room_4 ✓
7. After being in room_4, green_door_1 must be unlocked and blue_door_1 must be locked
   - After being in room_4, we unlock green_door_1 and blue_door_1 remains locked ✓
8. We must be in room_2 at some point
   - We end up in room_2 ✓
9. Before being in room_2, we must hold some object
   - Before entering room_2, we hold green_box_1 ✓
10. We must be in front of red_door_1 at some point
    - We go in front of red_door_1 to unlock it ✓

The plan seems valid! Here's the full sequence:

1. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3
2. toggle green_door_1
3. gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1
4. gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1
5. toggle red_door_1
6. gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1
7. gotoobject green_box_1 room_1
8. pick green_box_1 room_1
9. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2
10. toggle purple_door_1
11. gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1
12. gotoempty
13. drop green_box_1 room_2
14. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_2
15. pick grey_ball_1 room_2

This should achieve the goal of holding grey_ball_1 in room_2 while satisfying all constraints.

However, I notice one issue. Constraint #2 says:
"If expression 'you are holding some object' holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: 'At least one of the following conditions is true: "grey_ball_1 is in room_4", "you are in room_1"'"

Since grey_ball_1 starts in room_2, not room_4, we must be in room_1 before holding ANY object. In my plan, I do go to room_1 before picking up green_box_1, so this should be satisfied.

Let me check once more:
- We need to be in room_1 before picking up any object (or grey_ball_1 needs to be in room_4, which it isn't initially)
- We go to room_1, then pick up green_box_1, which satisfies this constraint
- We use green_box_1 to satisfy constraint #9 (must hold an object before entering room_2)
- In room_2, we drop green_box_1 and pick up grey_ball_1 to achieve the goal

This plan covers all constraints and achieves the goal. Let's finalize:

1. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3
2. toggle green_door_1
3. gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1
4. gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1
5. toggle red_door_1
6. gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1
7. gotoobject green_box_1 room_1
8. pick green_box_1 room_1
9. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2
10. toggle purple_door_1
11. gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1
12. gotoempty
13. drop green_box_1 room_2
14. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_2
15. pick grey_ball_1 room_2

But actually I realize two more issues:

1. At the beginning, I need to make it clear I'm going to green_door_1 by moving in front of it first.
2. I must be in front of red_door_1 at some point (constraint #10), which is satisfied when I go to toggle red_door_1.

One more time, the full plan:

1. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3
2. toggle green_door_1
3. gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1
4. gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1
5. toggle red_door_1
6. gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1
7. gotoobject green_box_1 room_1
8. pick green_box_1 room_1
9. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2
10. toggle purple_door_1
11. gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1
12. gotoempty
13. drop green_box_1 room_2
14. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_2
15. pick grey_ball_1 room_2

This plan is valid and minimal. It satisfies all constraints and achieves the goal.

Upon final review, I believe this is the complete and correct plan, covering all constraints and achieving the goal.

Actually, I do have one more concern: after reviewing the actions more carefully, when we "gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1", we are no longer "in front of green_door_1" (since the action clears that state). So in room_3, we first need to go to red_door_1 before we can toggle it. Let me make this adjustment:

1. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3
2. toggle green_door_1
3. gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1
4. gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1
5. toggle red_door_1
6. gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1
7. gotoobject green_box_1 room_1
8. pick green_box_1 room_1
9. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2
10. toggle purple_door_1
11. gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1
12. gotoempty
13. drop green_box_1 room_2
14. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_2
15. pick grey_ball_1 room_2

Now the plan should be correct and complete.
