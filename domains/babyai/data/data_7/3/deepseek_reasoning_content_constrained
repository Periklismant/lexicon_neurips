Okay, let's see. I need to solve this planning problem. The goal is to have the grey ball (grey_ball_1) in room_2, and I need to be holding it while in room_2. Also, there are a bunch of constraints to satisfy. Let me break this down step by step.

First, initial state: I'm in room_4. The grey_ball_1 is in room_2. So, I need to get to room_2 and pick up the ball. But the doors are locked initially. Let me check the doors. The doors are purple_door_1 (connects room_1 and 2), red_door_1 (room_1 and 3), blue_door_1 (room_2 and 4), green_door_1 (room_3 and 4). All doors are locked. The constraints say that blue_door_1 must always be locked. So I can't unlock that door. So how do I get from room_4 to room_2?

Wait, blue_door_1 connects room_2 and 4. Since it's always locked, I can't use that. So the only way to get to room_2 is through other rooms. Let's see the connections. To get from room_4 to room_2: room_4 is connected to room_2 via blue_door_1 (locked, can't use), and to room_3 via green_door_1. Green_door_1 is locked, but one of the constraints is that green_door_1 must be unlocked at least once. So maybe I can unlock green_door_1. To toggle a door, I need to be in front of it, right?

So first, I need to get to the green_door_1. But green_door_1 connects room_3 and 4. Since I'm in room_4, I can go to the green_door_1. But to do that, I need to goto the door. The precondition for "gotodoor d r1 r2" is that I'm in a room connected by d, and there's no object blocking the door's position in my current room. Are there any objects blocking doors in room_4? The objects in room_4 are grey_box_1 and blue_box_2. If they are blocking the door, then I can't go to the door. But how do I know if they're blocking? The problem statement says that the effects of picking up an object include that if the object was blocking a door, it's no longer blocking. But in the initial state, are any objects blocking doors? The initial state doesn't mention any objects blocking doors. So maybe all doors are unblocked initially. So I can go to green_door_1 from room_4.

So steps: 

1. From room_4, go to green_door_1 (using gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3). Then toggle it to unlock. But wait, the initial state says green_door_1 is locked. So after toggling, it becomes unlocked. But then, after unlocking green_door_1, I can go to room_3. But then from room_3, maybe go to room_1 via red_door_1, but that's locked. Need to unlock that as well. Hmm.

Wait, the goal is to be in room_2 holding the grey_ball_1. The grey_ball_1 is in room_2. But how do I get to room_2? Since blue_door_1 is always locked (the constraint says "blue_door_1 is locked" must hold in every state), I can't use that door. So perhaps the path is room_4 -> room_3 via green_door_1 (once unlocked) -> room_1 via red_door_1 (needs unlocking) -> room_2 via purple_door_1 (which is also locked). But all doors start locked. Let's think about the order.

Alternatively, maybe there's another path. Let's see:

The rooms are arranged as 1 (NW), 2 (SW), 3 (NE), 4 (SE). The doors are between 1-2 (purple_door_1), 1-3 (red_door_1), 2-4 (blue_door_1), 3-4 (green_door_1). Since blue_door_1 can't be used (must stay locked), to get from 4 to 2, I need to go through 3 and 1 and then 2. So 4 ->3 via green_door_1, then 3 ->1 via red_door_1, then 1 ->2 via purple_door_1. But all those doors are locked. So need to unlock them.

But the constraints also require:

- At least one state has green_door_1 unlocked. So I need to toggle that.

- At least one state has red_door_1 unlocked or me holding green_box_1. So either unlock red_door_1 or pick up green_box_1 (which is in room_1).

- Also, must be in front of red_door_1 at least once.

- When in room_4, at some state after, the blue_door_1 is locked and green_door_1 is unlocked. Since blue_door_1 is always locked, but when I'm in room_4, I need to ensure that after that state, at some point green_door_1 is unlocked. Which I will do by toggling it in room_4.

So the plan could be:

1. In room_4, go to green_door_1 (gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3).

2. Toggle green_door_1 to unlock it. Now green_door_1 is unlocked.

3. Go through green_door_1 to room_3 (gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1).

Now in room_3. The red_door_1 connects room_1 and 3. But red_door_1 is locked. To unlock it, need to get to it. But red_door_1 is in room_3? Or in room_1? Wait, doors are between two rooms. To toggle a door, you have to be in front of it in either room. So from room_3, can I go to red_door_1?

Yes. So:

4. In room_3, go to red_door_1 (gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1).

5. Toggle red_door_1 to unlock it. Now red_door_1 is unlocked.

6. Gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1.

Now in room_1. The purple_door_1 connects room_1 and 2. It's locked. Need to unlock it.

7. In room_1, go to purple_door_1 (gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2).

8. Toggle purple_door_1 to unlock it.

9. Gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1.

Now in room_2. The grey_ball_1 is here. But to pick it up, I need to be in front of it. Also, the constraints say that if I'm holding an object in some state, then there must be an earlier state where either grey_ball_1 is in room_4 or I was in room_1. Well, since grey_ball_1 starts in room_2 and isn't moved, that part (grey_ball_1 in room_4) is never true. So the earlier state where I was in room_1 must exist. But in this plan, I was in room_1 (step 6-8), so that's covered.

Also, the constraint that when in room_2, there must be an earlier state where I was holding an object. Wait, but the goal is to be holding grey_ball_1 in room_2. So when I pick up the grey_ball_1 in room_2, that's the first time I'm holding something. Then, when I'm in room_2, the earlier state would be the pick action. Hmm, but the constraint says if I'm in room_2 in some state, there must be an earlier state where I was holding an object. Wait, but the goal is to be in room_2 holding the ball. So when I'm in room_2, I might have just picked it up. So the holding would happen in the same state as being in room_2. But the constraint says that if I'm in room_2 in a state, there must be an earlier state where I was holding an object. That's a problem. Because in this plan, I would arrive in room_2 (step 9) and then pick up the ball. So being in room_2 (after step 9) would require that before that, I was holding an object. But in the steps so far, I haven't held any object yet.

Ah, that's a problem. So the constraint says: if you are in room_2 in some state, there must be an earlier state where you were holding some object. So when I go to room_2 (step 9), I need to have already held an object before that. So I need to pick up something before entering room_2.

But how? The path to room_2 is through room_1. Maybe I can pick up an object in room_1, then proceed to room_2. But the objects in room_1 are green_box_1 and yellow_box_1.

So let's adjust the plan. After step 6 (arriving in room_1), pick up an object, then proceed.

So step 6: arrive in room_1.

7. gotoobject green_box_1 room_1.

8. pick green_box_1 room_1.

Now, holding green_box_1.

9. drop green_box_1 room_1. (But why? Because maybe I need to unlock the door, but perhaps not. Alternatively, just carry it.)

Wait, but to unlock the door (purple_door_1), I need to be in front of it, which requires going to it. So step after 8:

9. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2.

10. toggle purple_door_1 (unlock).

11. gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1.

But when moving to room_2, the drop action isn't necessary. But the problem is, I need to be holding an object before entering room_2. So if I pick up green_box_1 in room_1, then proceed to room_2, then when I arrive in room_2, the constraint is satisfied because in an earlier state (step 8) I was holding the box. But then, in room_2, I need to drop the box to pick up the ball. But the goal is to be holding the grey_ball_1. So:

After arriving in room_2 (step 11), I have to drop the green_box_1, then pick up the grey_ball_1.

But that adds steps. Let's see:

But maybe there's another way. The constraint says that if you are in room_2 in any state, there must be an earlier state where you were holding an object. So even if you enter room_2 once, you must have held an object before. So in the initial plan, arriving in room_2 (step 9) would trigger the constraint. Therefore, before step 9, I need to have held something.

So to satisfy that, I need to pick up an object before entering room_2.

But where? In room_1, the objects are green_box_1 and yellow_box_1. So maybe pick up green_box_1 in room_1, then go to room_2.

So steps:

After arriving in room_1 (step 6):

7. gotoobject green_box_1 room_1.

8. pick green_box_1 room_1. Now holding it.

9. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2.

10. toggle purple_door_1 (unlock).

11. gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1. Now in room_2, holding green_box_1.

12. gotoempty (to drop).

13. drop green_box_1 room_2.

14. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_2.

15. pick grey_ball_1 room_2.

Now, in room_2, holding grey_ball_1. That's the goal.

But also, there's another constraint: the expression "you are holding some object" must hold in at least one state, which is satisfied here. Also, the constraint that if you are holding some object, there must be an earlier state where either grey_ball_1 is in room_4 (it's not, it's in room_2) or you were in room_1. Since we were in room_1 (steps 6-10), that's satisfied.

Also, the constraint that at least one state has "red_door_1 is not locked" or "you are holding green_box_1". Since we held green_box_1 (step 8), that satisfies this.

Another constraint: must be in front of red_door_1 at least once. When we went to red_door_1 in room_3 (step 4), we were in front of it. So that's covered.

The constraint that in every state, blue_door_1 is locked. Since we never toggled it, it remains locked.

The constraint that when you are in room_4 (which is the initial state), then at some state after that, blue_door_1 is locked (which it always is) and green_door_1 is not locked. We toggled green_door_1 in step 2, unlocking it. So after step 2, green_door_1 is unlocked. So in the initial state (room_4), the subsequent states (after step 2) have green_door_1 unlocked, satisfying that.

Also, the constraint that you must be in room_4 at least once. The initial state is room_4, so that's covered.

Now, let's check all constraints:

1. "you are holding some object" must hold in at least one state. Steps 8-13 and 15 onwards.

2. If holding an object, must have been in room_1 before. Step 6-10, yes.

3. "green_door_1 is not locked" at least once. Step 2.

4. "blue_door_1 is locked" in every state. Yes, never touched.

5. "red_door_1 is not locked" or holding green_box_1. We unlocked red_door_1 (step 5), so that's covered. Also, holding green_box_1 (step 8) also covers this.

6. "you are in room_4" at least once. Initial state.

7. If in room_4 (initial state), then after that, green_door_1 is unlocked. Yes, step 2.

8. "you are in room_2" at least once. Step 11.

9. If in room_2, must have held object before. Step 8.

10. "you are in front of red_door_1" at least once. Step 4.

Now, the plan steps would be:

1. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3

2. toggle green_door_1

3. gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1

4. gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1

5. toggle red_door_1

6. gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1

7. gotoobject green_box_1 room_1

8. pick green_box_1 room_1

9. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2

10. toggle purple_door_1

11. gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1

12. gotoempty

13. drop green_box_1 room_2

14. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_2

15. pick grey_ball_1 room_2

Wait, but step 13 is dropping the box. Then steps 14 and 15 pick up the ball. So in step 15, you're holding the ball in room_2. That's the goal.

But can we optimize this? For example, after step 11, when you are in room_2 holding the green_box_1, can you drop it immediately and then pick up the ball? Or maybe, after dropping, you can pick up the ball. But the drop requires being in front of an empty spot. So steps 12 and 13 are necessary.

But maybe there's a shorter path. Let's think.

Alternative approach: After entering room_2 (step 11), you are holding green_box_1. Then, you can drop it in room_2. Then pick up the grey_ball_1. But that's the same as above.

Alternatively, is there a way to not have to carry the green_box_1? But the constraint requires that when you are in room_2, you have held an object before. So if you can hold an object before entering room_2, maybe you can drop it earlier. For example, pick up green_box_1 in room_1, then drop it in room_1, then proceed to room_2. But then, when you enter room_2, the constraint requires that you held an object before. But in that case, the holding was in room_1, which is earlier. So that could work. Let's see.

So steps:

After step 6 (arrive in room_1):

7. gotoobject green_box_1 room_1

8. pick green_box_1 room_1

9. drop green_box_1 room_1 (after moving to empty?)

Wait, to drop, you need to be in front of an empty position. So after picking up, you're no longer in front of the object. So:

7. gotoobject green_box_1 room_1

8. pick green_box_1 room_1 (now holding it, not in front of anything)

9. gotoempty (room_1)

10. drop green_box_1 room_1 (now not holding anything)

Then proceed to unlock purple_door_1.

But then, when you enter room_2, you haven't held any object after dropping it. So the constraint for entering room_2 is that you must have held an object before. Since you held it in step 8, which is before entering room_2 (step 11 or whatever), that's okay.

So this way, you don't have to carry the box to room_2.

So modified steps:

1. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3

2. toggle green_door_1

3. gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1

4. gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1

5. toggle red_door_1

6. gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1

7. gotoobject green_box_1 room_1

8. pick green_box_1 room_1

9. gotoempty room_1

10. drop green_box_1 room_1

11. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2

12. toggle purple_door_1

13. gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1

14. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_2

15. pick grey_ball_1 room_2

But this plan is shorter. Let's check the constraints:

When entering room_2 (step 13), the previous holding of green_box_1 in step 8 is earlier. So satisfies the constraint. The other constraints:

- "you are holding some object" in step 8-9.

- The constraint about holding implies being in room_1 (step 6-10).

- green_door_1 unlocked in step 2.

- blue_door_1 always locked.

- red_door_1 unlocked (step 5) or holding green_box_1 (step 8).

- in room_4 at initial.

- when in room_4, after that, green_door_1 is unlocked (step 2).

- in room_2 at step 13.

- in front of red_door_1 at step4.

So this plan satisfies all constraints and is shorter. So this is better.

But wait, does step 14 (gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_2) require that I'm in room_2, which I am. Also, after step 13, I'm in room_2 and not in front of anything. So step 14: gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_2.

Then pick it up. Then the goal is achieved.

This plan has 15 steps, but maybe it can be optimized more. Let me count steps again:

Original steps (shorter version):

1. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3

2. toggle green_door_1

3. gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1

4. gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1

5. toggle red_door_1

6. gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1

7. gotoobject green_box_1 room_1

8. pick green_box_1 room_1

9. gotoempty room_1

10. drop green_box_1 room_1

11. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2

12. toggle purple_door_1

13. gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1

14. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_2

15. pick grey_ball_1 room_2

But after step 10, dropping the box in room_1, then proceeding to the door. So steps 11-15. But perhaps step 9 can be skipped if after picking up, you're already in front of an empty spot? No, because after picking up, you are no longer in front of the object. So you need to gotoempty before dropping.

Alternatively, maybe after picking up, you can drop directly. But the drop action requires that you are in front of an empty position. Wait, the preconditions for drop are: you are holding x, and the position in front of you is empty. So after picking up, you are not in front of anything. So you need to gotoempty to be in front of an empty spot. So step 9 is necessary.

Another way to drop: after picking up, can I drop it immediately? No, because after picking up, you're not in front of any position. So you have to move to an empty spot first.

So steps 7-10 are necessary.

But maybe after step 13 (in room_2), instead of dropping the box in room_1, you can just drop it in room_2. Wait, but in the alternative plan where you carry the box to room_2, then you can drop it there. But then, you have to carry it through the door. Let me compare the two plans.

Original plan (carrying box to room_2):

Steps: 1-11 (enter room_2), 12 (drop), 13 (goto ball), 14 (pick). So 14 steps.

Alternative plan (dropping in room_1):

Steps 1-15. Wait, no, the alternative plan where you drop in room_1 is shorter. Let me recount:

Steps:

1. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3

2. toggle green_door_1

3. gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1

4. gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1

5. toggle red_door_1

6. gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1

7. gotoobject green_box_1 room_1

8. pick green_box_1 room_1

9. gotoempty

10. drop green_box_1 room_1

11. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2

12. toggle purple_door_1

13. gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1

14. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_2

15. pick grey_ball_1 room_2

That's 15 steps. The other plan where you carry the box to room_2:

Steps:

1. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3

2. toggle green_door_1

3. gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1

4. gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1

5. toggle red_door_1

6. gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1

7. gotoobject green_box_1 room_1

8. pick green_box_1 room_1

9. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2

10. toggle purple_door_1

11. gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1

12. gotoempty

13. drop green_box_1 room_2

14. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_2

15. pick grey_ball_1 room_2

Also 15 steps. So same length. Which one is better? Both are same. But maybe there's a way to shorten.

Wait, after step 8 in the first alternative, when you pick up the box, you need to go to the door. So instead of gotoempty and drop, maybe you can go directly to the door while holding the box. So:

After step 8 (holding green_box_1), go to the door (purple_door_1), which is in room_1. So:

9. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2 (precondition: in room_1, door connects to room_2, and no object blocking. Assuming no blocking.)

10. toggle purple_door_1 (unlock)

11. gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1. Now in room_2, holding green_box_1.

12. gotoempty in room_2.

13. drop green_box_1 room_2.

14. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_2.

15. pick grey_ball_1 room_2.

That's 15 steps as well. So same.

But perhaps we can skip some steps. For example, after step 11 (arrive in room_2), can we drop the box without going to empty? No, because to drop, you need to be in front of an empty spot. So after arriving in room_2, you're not in front of anything. So you have to gotoempty to be in front of empty, then drop.

Alternatively, after arriving in room_2, you can goto the grey_ball_1, but since you're holding the box, you need to drop it first. So steps 12-13 are necessary.

So either way, it's 15 steps. But perhaps there's a way to optimize further.

Wait, when you arrive in room_2 (step 11), you are not holding any object if you dropped the box in room_1. So in that case, when you enter room_2, you need to pick up the ball. But to pick up the ball, you need to be in front of it. So steps 14-15. So steps:

13. gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1

14. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_2

15. pick grey_ball_1 room_2

That's three steps (14-15), which is two actions. So total steps for this version:

1. gotodoor green_door_1 room4 room3

2. toggle green_door_1

3. gotoroom 4 3 green

4. gotodoor red_door_1 room3 room1

5. toggle red_door_1

6. gotoroom 3 1 red

7. gotoobject green_box_1 room1

8. pick green_box_1

9. gotoempty room1

10. drop green_box_1 room1

11. gotodoor purple_door_1 room1 room2

12. toggle purple_door_1

13. gotoroom 1 2 purple

14. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room2

15. pick grey_ball_1 room2

So 15 steps. Alternatively, if you carry the box:

1. gotodoor green_door_1 room4 room3

2. toggle green_door_1

3. gotoroom 4 3 green

4. gotodoor red_door_1 room3 room1

5. toggle red_door_1

6. gotoroom 3 1 red

7. gotoobject green_box_1 room1

8. pick green_box_1 room1

9. gotodoor purple_door_1 room1 room2

10. toggle purple_door_1

11. gotoroom 1 2 purple

12. gotoempty room2

13. drop green_box_1 room2

14. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room2

15. pick grey_ball_1 room2

Also 15 steps. No difference in length.

So both plans are same length. Is there any shorter way?

Let's think: Maybe unlock doors in a different order. For example, can I unlock purple_door_1 from room_2's side? No, because initially I'm in room_4. To get to room_2, I need to go through other rooms.

Alternatively, is there a way to avoid going to room_3?

Wait, the green_door_1 connects room_3 and 4. To get to room_3, you have to go through green_door_1. From room_3, you can go to room_1 via red_door_1. So no other path.

Hmm.

Alternatively, could I use another door to reach room_2? Like room_4 -> room_2 via blue_door_1, but it's locked and must stay locked. So no.

So the path is room_4 ->3->1->2.

Therefore, the steps are necessary.

So the minimal plan is 15 steps. But wait, maybe there's a way to avoid toggling some doors. For example, the constraint about the red_door_1: at least one state must have red_door_1 unlocked or holding green_box_1. If I don't toggle red_door_1 but instead hold green_box_1, would that satisfy the constraint? Because holding green_box_1 would satisfy the "at least one of red_door_1 unlocked or holding green_box_1".

But if I don't unlock red_door_1, then I can't go from room_3 to room_1. So that's impossible. So I must unlock red_door_1 to proceed.

Wait, no. If I can find a different path to room_1. Let's see. The initial rooms are:

room_1 connected to room_2 (purple_door_1), room_3 (red_door_1).

room_2 connected to room_4 (blue_door_1), room_1.

room_3 connected to room_4 (green_door_1), room_1.

room_4 connected to room_2 and 3.

So if I can't use blue_door_1, the only way to room_1 is via room_3 and red_door_1. So unlocking red_door_1 is necessary.

So that's unavoidable.

So the plan must include unlocking green_door_1, red_door_1, and purple_door_1.

Alternatively, is there a way to avoid unlocking purple_door_1? Let me see. The purple_door_1 connects room_1 and 2. To get to room_2 from room_1, I need to use that door. So yes, must unlock it.

So all three doors must be unlocked. Therefore, the steps to unlock them are necessary.

Therefore, the plan length is 15 steps. But perhaps there's a shorter way. Let me check each action.

Alternative approach:

After arriving in room_1 (step 6), instead of picking up green_box_1, perhaps pick up yellow_box_1. Does it matter? No, because the constraint is about green_box_1. The constraint says that if in any state you are holding an object, then you must have been in room_1 or grey_ball_1 is in room_4. Since grey_ball_1 isn't, you must have been in room_1. So if you pick up any object, as long as you were in room_1 before, which you are, it's okay. But the other constraint is that at least one state must have "red_door_1 is not locked" or "you are holding green_box_1". So if you pick up yellow_box_1, then you need to have red_door_1 unlocked. But we already unlocked red_door_1 (step 5), so that's okay. So maybe that's an option.

But why does it matter? The plan would still require the same number of steps.

Hmm. So no optimization there.

Alternatively, after unlocking red_door_1, go to room_1 and then instead of picking up a box, perhaps unlock purple_door_1 and go to room_2, but then when entering room_2, you have to have held an object before. So you need to pick up something before entering room_2.

But the objects in room_1 are boxes. So you have to pick up one of them, then proceed.

So the only way to satisfy the constraint when entering room_2 is to have held an object before.

Thus, the steps to pick up and drop are necessary.

Wait, but what if you don't drop the object and keep holding it until room_2, then drop it there? That's what the first plan does. So steps:

1. gotodoor green_door_1 room4 room3

2. toggle green_door_1

3. gotoroom 4 3 green_door_1

4. gotodoor red_door_1 room3 room1

5. toggle red_door_1

6. gotoroom 3 1 red_door_1

7. gotoobject green_box_1 room1

8. pick green_box_1 room1

9. gotodoor purple_door_1 room1 room2

10. toggle purple_door_1

11. gotoroom 1 2 purple_door_1

12. gotoempty room2

13. drop green_box_1 room2

14. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room2

15. pick grey_ball_1 room2

Yes, this is still 15 steps. So no way to shorten.

Is there any way to combine actions? For example, after toggling a door, immediately go through it. But each action is separate.

Alternatively, can I avoid going to empty in room_2? For example, after dropping the box, can I go directly to the ball?

After step 13 (drop green_box_1), you're in front of an empty spot. To pick up the ball, you need to be in front of it. So you have to gotoobject grey_ball_1 room2 (step 14). So that's necessary.

Hmm. I think this is the optimal plan. It has 15 steps. But maybe there's a shorter path.

Wait, what if after picking up the green_box_1 in room_1 (step 8), instead of dropping it, carry it to room_2 and then use it to satisfy some other constraint? But the goal is to hold the grey_ball_1, so you have to drop the box anyway. So no.

Another idea: When you pick up the green_box_1, maybe you can drop it in room_3 or room_4, but that would require backtracking, which adds steps. Not helpful.

Alternatively, after step 3 (in room_3), can I pick up any object there? The objects in room_3 are green_box_2 and purple_box_1. But the constraint when holding an object requires having been in room_1. So if I pick up an object in room_3, then I need to have been in room_1 before. But I'm not in room_1 yet. So that's not possible. Therefore, the only way to satisfy the constraint when holding an object is to pick it up in room_1.

So, I think the plan has to be as described. Therefore, the optimal plan is 15 steps. But wait, let me recount:

Original steps:

1. gotodoor green_door_1 room4 room3

2. toggle green_door_1

3. gotoroom 4 3 green_door_1

4. gotodoor red_door_1 room3 room1

5. toggle red_door_1

6. gotoroom 3 1 red_door_1

7. gotoobject green_box_1 room1

8. pick green_box_1 room1

9. gotodoor purple_door_1 room1 room2

10. toggle purple_door_1

11. gotoroom 1 2 purple_door_1

12. gotoempty room2

13. drop green_box_1 room2

14. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room2

15. pick grey_ball_1 room2

Yes, 15 actions. Let me see if any steps can be merged or skipped.

Wait, after step 8 (pick green_box_1), you are in room_1 and holding it. To go to the purple_door_1, you need to be in room_1. So step 9 is gotodoor purple_door_1 room1 room2. Since you're in room_1, this is allowed. Then toggle (step 10), then gotoroom (step 11). So steps 9-11 are necessary.

After arriving in room_2, you need to drop the box (steps 12-13), then pick up the ball (14-15).

So yes, it's 15 steps. I don't see a shorter path.
