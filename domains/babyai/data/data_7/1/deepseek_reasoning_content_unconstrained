Okay, let's try to figure out how to solve this planning problem. So, the goal is to have a grey door that I'm in front of and it's unlocked. Let's start by looking at the initial state to see what doors are grey and their current status.

Looking at the doors: purple_door_1 is purple, grey_door_1 is grey, purple_door_2 is purple, green_door_1 is green. So the only grey door is grey_door_1. The problem says I need to be in front of a grey door (d) that's not locked. Currently, all doors are locked. So I need to unlock grey_door_1.

But where is grey_door_1? The initial state says room_1 and room_3 are connected via grey_door_1. So grey_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3. To toggle a door, I need to be in front of it. So I need to get to grey_door_1, which is between room_1 and room_3.

I start in room_2. So the path to room_1 might be through purple_door_1, which connects room_2 and room_1. But purple_door_1 is locked. Wait, all doors are locked initially. So I need to unlock doors to move between rooms. But to unlock a door, I have to be in front of it. But how do I get to a door if it's locked? Because to go through a door, it needs to be unlocked. Wait, the "gotodoor" action requires that there's no object blocking the position in front of the door in the current room. But maybe the doors themselves are locked, but the "gotodoor" action just requires that the door is in the room and not blocked. Wait, the "goto door" preconditions are: (i) you are in a room that door d connects, and (ii) no object is blocking the position in front of d. So even if the door is locked, I can go in front of it as long as there's no object blocking. Once in front, I can toggle it (unlock it). Then I can go through.

So starting in room_2. To get to grey_door_1, which connects room_1 and room_3, I need to get to room_1 first. The door between room_2 and room_1 is purple_door_1. So first, go to purple_door_1 in room_2. But to do that, I need to be in room_2 (which I am), and check if there's any object blocking the position in front of purple_door_1 in room_2. The initial state doesn't mention any objects blocking doors. Wait, the problem states that objects can block doors. Let's check the initial objects in each room. In room_2, there's purple_ball_1. But is it blocking a door? The initial state doesn't say anything about objects blocking doors. So perhaps by default, objects are not blocking doors unless specified. So maybe the doors are not blocked. So I can go to purple_door_1 from room_2.

So steps:

1. Goto purple_door_1 in room_2: gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1. Wait, the action is "gotodoor d r1 r2", where d is the door, and r1 and r2 are the rooms it connects. Wait, the correct syntax is "gotodoor d r1 r2" where you are in r1 or r2. Since I'm in room_2, and purple_door_1 connects room_2 and room_1, the correct command would be "gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1".

After that, I'm in front of purple_door_1. Then I can toggle it to unlock it. Then I can go through to room_1.

But wait, the door is locked. To unlock it, I need to toggle it. Since it's locked, toggling it will unlock it. So:

Action 1: gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1
Action 2: toggle purple_door_1
Now, purple_door_1 is unlocked. Then I can go to room_1 via purple_door_1.

Action 3: gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1

Now I'm in room_1. Then, I need to get to grey_door_1. Grey_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3. So in room_1, I can go to grey_door_1.

Action 4: gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_3

Now I'm in front of grey_door_1. But it's locked. Toggle it to unlock.

Action 5: toggle grey_door_1

Now grey_door_1 is unlocked. The goal requires that the door d is grey, I'm in front of d, and d is not locked. So after action 5, I'm in front of grey_door_1 (grey), which is now unlocked. So the goal is achieved. Wait, but the problem's goal is "There is a door d such that the conditions are true: d is grey, you are in front of d, d is not locked". So after action 5, that's achieved. So the plan would be:

goto door purple_door_1 (room2 to room1)
toggle purple_door_1 (unlock)
goto room1 from room2 via purple_door_1
goto door grey_door_1 in room1
toggle grey_door_1 (unlock)

So the sequence would be:

gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1
toggle purple_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_3
toggle grey_door_1

But wait, after toggling grey_door_1, the door is unlocked. So after the toggle action, the state would be that grey_door_1 is unlocked, and I'm in front of it. So that satisfies all the goal conditions. So that's five actions. Let's check if that's possible.

But let's verify each step's preconditions.

Initial state: in room_2, not holding anything.

Action 1: gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1. Preconditions: I'm in room_2 (yes), and no object is blocking in front of the door in room_2. Assuming no objects are blocking, this is allowed.

Action 2: toggle purple_door_1. Precondition: must be in front of it. After action 1, I'm in front of purple_door_1. So allowed. Toggle unlocks it.

Action3: gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1. Preconditions: in room_2 (yes), adjacent to room_1 (yes), door is unlocked (now yes, since action2 unlocked it). So allowed. Now in room_1.

Action4: gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_3. Preconditions: in room_1 (yes), no blocking object. So allowed. Now in front of grey_door_1.

Action5: toggle grey_door_1. Now unlocks it. So after this, grey_door_1 is unlocked, and I'm in front of it. So the goal is achieved.

So this plan works and has 5 steps. But is there a shorter path?

Wait, maybe there's another door. Let me check. The doors are:

- purple_door_1 connects room_1 and room_2.

- grey_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3.

- purple_door_2 connects room_2 and room_4.

- green_door_1 connects room_3 and room_4.

But the goal is to have a grey door. The only grey door is grey_door_1. So we must get to grey_door_1.

So the steps above are necessary. Let me check if there's a way to do it in fewer steps.

Alternative path: Maybe through room_3? But starting in room_2. To get to room_3, I would need to go through room_1 via grey_door_1, but that's locked. Or from room_4 via green_door_1. But starting in room_2, the path to room_3 would be room_2 -> room_1 (unlock purple_door_1) -> room_1, then unlock grey_door_1. So same as before.

Alternatively, if there's a way to reach grey_door_1 from another direction, but no. The doors are only connecting room_1 and room_3. So no other way. So the initial plan seems optimal.

But wait, maybe there's a way to unlock grey_door_1 without going through room_1. For example, if I can go to room_3 via another path. Let's see. But the initial doors are all locked, so to move between rooms, I need to unlock doors. To get to room_3, the doors are grey_door_1 (from room_1) or green_door_1 (from room_4). But green_door_1 is green and locked. So starting in room_2, to get to room_4, I need to unlock purple_door_2 (connects room_2 and room_4). Then go to room_4, then unlock green_door_1 to get to room_3. But that would be longer. Let's see:

Alternative plan:

1. gotodoor purple_door_2 room_2 room_4

2. toggle purple_door_2 (unlock)

3. gotoroom room_2 room_4 purple_door_2

4. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3

5. toggle green_door_1 (unlock)

6. gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1

7. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1

But wait, grey_door_1 is between room_1 and room_3. So in room_3, can I go to grey_door_1? Yes. So step 7: gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1.

Then step8: toggle grey_door_1 (unlock). Now in front of grey_door_1 (grey), which is unlocked. That's 8 steps, which is longer than the previous plan of 5 steps. So the initial plan is better.

Therefore, the initial plan of 5 actions is optimal.

Now, let's write the plan step by step:

1. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1

2. toggle purple_door_1

3. gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1

4. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_3

5. toggle grey_door_1

Each step is necessary. Let's check if any steps can be merged or skipped.

Wait, after step 3, I'm in room_1. Then step 4 is going to the door. Then step 5 unlocks it. So yes, this is correct.

So the final answer is the sequence of these five actions.
