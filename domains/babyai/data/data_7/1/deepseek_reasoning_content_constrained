Okay, let's try to tackle this planning problem. Hmm, the goal is to have a grey door that's unlocked, and I'm in front of it. The constraints are quite a lot, so I need to make sure each one is satisfied. Let me start by understanding the initial state and the goal.

First, the initial state: I'm in room_2. All doors are locked. The doors are purple_door_1 (connects room_1 and room_2), grey_door_1 (connects room_1 and room_3), purple_door_2 (connects room_2 and room_4), and green_door_1 (connects room_3 and room_4). The goal requires a grey door that's unlocked and I'm in front of it. The grey doors are grey_door_1 and maybe others? Looking back, the doors are: purple_door_1 is purple, grey_door_1 is grey, purple_door_2 is purple, green_door_1 is green. So the only grey door is grey_door_1, which connects room_1 and room_3. But wait, the constraints say I can't be in room_1 at any time. So I can't go to room_1. That complicates things because grey_door_1 is between room_1 and room_3. So if I can't go to room_1, how can I reach grey_door_1? Wait, unless there's another way. Let me check the door connections again.

The doors are:

- purple_door_1 connects room_1 and room_2 (locked initially)
- grey_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3 (locked)
- purple_door_2 connects room_2 and room_4 (locked)
- green_door_1 connects room_3 and room_4 (locked)

So, since I'm in room_2 initially, and I can't enter room_1, I need to find another path. The only other doors from room_2 are purple_door_2 leading to room_4, but that's locked. So maybe I need to unlock purple_door_2 first. But to unlock a door, I need to be in front of it. So to toggle it, I need to go to the door in the current room. Let's see: purple_door_2 is in room_2 and room_4. So from room_2, I can goto door purple_door_2. But the door is locked, so I can't go through it yet. Wait, but to toggle a door, I just need to be in front of it. So maybe I can unlock purple_door_2 from room_2. But wait, the preconditions for "toggle d" require that I'm in front of d. So first, I need to goto purple_door_2 in room_2. But the problem is, there might be objects blocking the position in front of the door. The initial state says... Wait, the initial state doesn't mention any objects blocking doors. The only objects are boxes and balls in various rooms. So maybe the doors aren't blocked. Let me check the initial state again.

Looking at the initial objects: in room_2, there's purple_ball_1. The boxes are in room_1, room_4, etc. So, unless an object is in front of a door, which is not mentioned here. The initial state doesn't state any door is blocked, so perhaps all doors are unblocked. So from room_2, I can go to purple_door_2 (which connects to room_4), then toggle it to unlock. Then I can go to room_4. But the constraints require that if purple_door_1 is unlocked (which is in room_1 and room_2), then I must have been in room_4 before. But purple_door_1 is in room_2 as well. Wait, the constraint says if purple_door_1 is not locked in any state, there must be an earlier state where I was in room_4. So if I ever unlock purple_door_1, I need to have been in room_4 before. But the goal doesn't involve purple_door_1. The goal is about a grey door (grey_door_1). But since I can't go to room_1, how can I reach grey_door_1? Because grey_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3. If I can't go to room_1, maybe I can approach grey_door_1 from room_3. Wait, but to get to room_3, I need to go through room_1 (via grey_door_1) or through room_4 via green_door_1. Let's see: room_3 is connected to room_1 via grey_door_1 and to room_4 via green_door_1. So if I can get to room_4, then I can go to room_3 via green_door_1. But green_door_1 is locked initially. So to unlock green_door_1, I need to be in front of it. So let's see the path:

From room_2, unlock purple_door_2 (which is in room_2), then go to room_4. Then in room_4, unlock green_door_1 (connects room_4 and room_3). Then go to room_3. From room_3, grey_door_1 connects to room_1, but since I can't enter room_1, maybe I can approach grey_door_1 from room_3. Then, to toggle it, I need to be in front of it. But grey_door_1 is in room_3, so I can goto that door (if not blocked), toggle it to unlock. Then, being in front of grey_door_1 (in room_3) would satisfy the goal. But the goal is that there's a door d that's grey, I'm in front of it, and it's unlocked. So grey_door_1 is the only grey door. So if I can unlock it and be in front of it in room_3, that would work. But how to get there without entering room_1.

But the problem is that grey_door_1 is locked initially. So steps needed:

1. Unlock purple_door_2 in room_2: goto purple_door_2 in room_2, toggle it. Then go to room_4 via purple_door_2.

2. In room_4, unlock green_door_1 by going to the door and toggling it. Then go to room_3 via green_door_1.

3. In room_3, go to grey_door_1 (which connects to room_1) and toggle it to unlock. Then, be in front of grey_door_1 in room_3.

But wait, the constraints have several conditions. Let me check the constraints:

Constraints:

1. grey_door_1 is locked must hold in at least one state. Since initially it's locked, that's covered.

2. If in some state s, grey_door_1 is locked, then in s or after, the agent must be in front of grey_box_2 and holding an object. So, since the initial state has grey_door_1 locked, this condition must be satisfied. So at some point after the initial state (when grey_door_1 is locked), the agent must be in front of grey_box_2 (which is in room_4) and holding an object. But the agent starts in room_2. So to get to room_4, they need to unlock purple_door_2. Then go to room_4, find grey_box_2 there, and pick it up. But wait, the constraint says that if grey_door_1 is locked in any state, then in that state or a later one, the agent must be in front of grey_box_2 and holding something. So perhaps after unlocking purple_door_2 and going to room_4, the agent can pick up grey_box_2 (but boxes can't be picked up? Wait, the actions include "pick x r" where x can be a box or a ball. Wait, the objects are boxes and balls. So can the agent pick up boxes? The problem doesn't state that boxes can't be picked up. So maybe yes. But in the initial state, the agent is not holding any object. So, to satisfy this constraint, after grey_door_1 is locked (which it is initially and until we unlock it), the agent must at some point be in front of grey_box_2 and holding an object. So perhaps the agent can go to room_4, pick up grey_box_2 (if possible), which would satisfy that. But first, the agent needs to get to room_4, which requires unlocking purple_door_2. So steps:

- goto purple_door_2 in room_2, toggle to unlock, then goto room_4.

- In room_4, go to grey_box_2, pick it up. Then drop it if needed. But that would satisfy the constraint.

3. The next constraint: there must be a state where the agent is holding yellow_box_1 and blue_ball_2 is in room_2. Yellow_box_1 is in room_4, blue_ball_2 is in room_3. So the agent needs to pick up yellow_box_1 and move blue_ball_2 to room_2. But moving blue_ball_2 would require picking it up from room_3 and dropping it in room_2. But to get to room_3, the agent needs to go through room_4 via green_door_1. So after unlocking green_door_1, go to room_3, pick up blue_ball_2, then go back to room_4, then to room_2 via purple_door_2. But the agent can't carry two objects at once. So they need to make multiple trips. Or perhaps, carry yellow_box_1 and blue_ball_2 in separate steps.

But the constraint requires that in at least one state, both holding yellow_box_1 and blue_ball_2 is in room_2. So maybe the agent can hold yellow_box_1 and then have blue_ball_2 in room_2 through another action. For example, drop blue_ball_2 in room_2 while holding yellow_box_1. But the agent can't hold two objects at once, so that's not possible. So perhaps, the agent needs to first bring blue_ball_2 to room_2 (by picking it up in room_3 and dropping it in room_2), then later pick up yellow_box_1. Then, in the state where the agent is holding yellow_box_1, blue_ball_2 is already in room_2. That would satisfy the constraint. So steps: go to room_3, get blue_ball_2, bring it to room_2, drop it. Then go to room_4, get yellow_box_1. Then, when holding yellow_box_1, blue_ball_2 is in room_2. That would work.

4. The next constraint: you are not in room_1 in every state. So the agent must never be in room_1. So all actions must avoid entering room_1.

5. At least one state where purple_door_1 is not locked. Purple_door_1 is between room_1 and room_2. Since the agent is in room_2 initially, they can approach purple_door_1 in room_2. But if they unlock it, but according to constraint 6, if purple_door_1 is unlocked in any state, there must be a prior state where the agent was in room_4. So before unlocking purple_door_1, the agent must have been in room_4. But the agent can't go to room_1, so unlocking purple_door_1 may not be necessary unless required by the goal. Wait, the goal is to have a grey door (grey_door_1) unlocked and in front. So perhaps unlocking purple_door_1 isn't needed. But the constraint says that purple_door_1 must be unlocked in at least one state. Wait, no. The fifth constraint is: "The following expression must hold in at least one state: purple_door_1 is not locked". So the agent must have purple_door_1 unlocked at some point. But how, since the agent is in room_2 and purple_door_1 is in room_2 (connects to room_1). But the agent can go to purple_door_1 in room_2, but to unlock it, they need to toggle it. But constraint 6 says that if purple_door_1 is unlocked in any state, the agent must have been in room_4 before that. So the agent needs to first go to room_4, then unlock purple_door_1. But to go to room_4, the agent needs to unlock purple_door_2 in room_2. So the steps would be:

- Unlock purple_door_2, go to room_4 (now the agent has been in room_4).

- Then return to room_2, go to purple_door_1, toggle to unlock it. That would satisfy the fifth constraint (purple_door_1 is not locked in that state), and since the agent was in room_4 before, it satisfies constraint 6.

But the agent has to unlock purple_door_1 for this. But does the plan require it? The goal is about grey_door_1. But the constraints require that purple_door_1 is unlocked in at least one state. So the agent must unlock purple_door_1 once. So that adds steps.

But let's see. The constraints are:

5. At least one state with purple_door_1 unlocked.

6. If purple_door_1 is unlocked in any state, agent must have been in room_4 before.

So the agent needs to first go to room_4 (unlocking purple_door_2), then return to room_2, unlock purple_door_1. But then, purple_door_1 is unlocked, which satisfies constraint 5. However, the agent is allowed to unlock and then re-lock it, but that may complicate things. But the constraint just requires that in at least one state it's unlocked. So once they unlock it, even if they lock it again later, that's okay. But the agent needs to make sure that when they unlock it, they have been in room_4 before.

7. The next constraint: At least one state where grey_door_1 is not locked. Which is part of the goal, so that's covered if we unlock it.

8. If grey_door_1 is not locked in any state, then the agent must have been holding purple_ball_1 in an earlier state. So to unlock grey_door_1, the agent must have held purple_ball_1 before. Purple_ball_1 is in room_2 initially. So the agent needs to pick up purple_ball_1, then later unlock grey_door_1. So steps: pick up purple_ball_1 in room_2, then drop it somewhere, then proceed to unlock grey_door_1. But the constraint requires that whenever grey_door_1 is unlocked, there was an earlier state where the agent was holding purple_ball_1.

9. At least one state where the agent is in room_2. Well, the initial state satisfies that, but there's another constraint: if the agent is in room_2 in any state, then at that state or a later one, green_door_1 is not locked and the agent is holding purple_ball_1. So, after being in room_2 (which is the starting point), in that state or a subsequent one, green_door_1 must be unlocked and the agent must be holding purple_ball_1. So the agent must at some point after being in room_2, unlock green_door_1 and hold purple_ball_1. But green_door_1 is in room_3 and room_4. To unlock green_door_1, the agent needs to be in front of it in room_4 or room_3. So perhaps after going to room_4, unlock green_door_1, then go to room_3, unlock grey_door_1. But then, how does this tie into holding purple_ball_1?

10. The last constraint: At least one state where the agent is holding grey_ball_1 and some object. But the agent can't hold two objects at once. So this must be a typo? Because "you are holding grey_ball_1" and "you are holding some object" is redundant. Maybe it's supposed to be "you are holding grey_ball_1 and another object"? Wait, the original constraint says "The following conditions are all true: "you are holding grey_ball_1", "you are holding some object"". But you can't hold two objects. So this seems impossible. Unless it's a mistake. Maybe it's a mistake and should be "you are holding grey_ball_1 or some object". But as written, it's a contradiction. So perhaps the intended constraint is that the agent is holding grey_ball_1 and another object, but that's impossible. Alternatively, it's a mistake and should be "you are holding grey_ball_1 OR some object". But the way it's written is "all true", so both must hold. Which is impossible. Unless the agent is holding two objects, which is not allowed. So this might be a problem. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:

"The following expression must hold in at least one state: 
		"The following conditions are all true: "you are holding grey_ball_1", "you are holding some object"""

This is impossible because you can't hold two objects. Therefore, this constraint can't be satisfied. But since the problem says to provide a valid plan, maybe there's a mistake here. Alternatively, maybe "some object" includes grey_ball_1, so it's redundant. But the way it's written, both conditions must be true. So the agent must be holding grey_ball_1 and holding some object (which includes grey_ball_1). So technically, if you're holding grey_ball_1, then you're holding some object. So maybe the constraint is just that you must be holding grey_ball_1 at some point. But perhaps the problem has a typo. But assuming that's the case, the agent needs to hold grey_ball_1 at some point. Grey_ball_1 is in room_4. So the agent needs to go to room_4, pick it up.

Putting all this together, the plan must:

1. Start in room_2.

2. Pick up purple_ball_1 in room_2 (to satisfy constraint 8 when unlocking grey_door_1 later).

3. Go to purple_door_2 in room_2, unlock it (toggle).

4. Go to room_4 via purple_door_2.

5. Now, the agent is in room_4. This satisfies constraint 6 if they later unlock purple_door_1.

6. In room_4, pick up grey_ball_1 (to satisfy constraint 10). But the agent is already holding purple_ball_1, so they can't. So they need to drop purple_ball_1 first. Wait, but they need to hold purple_ball_1 to satisfy constraint 8. So maybe:

Sequence:

- gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_2.

- pick purple_ball_1 room_2.

- gotodoor purple_door_2 room_2 room_4.

- toggle purple_door_2.

- gotoroom room_2 room_4 purple_door_2. (Now in room_4)

- drop purple_ball_1 room_4. (To free hands to pick up grey_ball_1)

- gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_4.

- pick grey_ball_1 room_4. (Now satisfies constraint 10: holding grey_ball_1 and some object, but that's redundant. But perhaps this is the intended step.)

- Then, drop grey_ball_1 and pick up purple_ball_1 again if needed.

But this is getting complicated. Let's try to outline the steps.

Main steps needed:

- Unlock purple_door_2 to go to room_4.

- Unlock green_door_1 in room_4 to go to room_3.

- Unlock grey_door_1 in room_3 (after having held purple_ball_1 earlier).

- Also, need to unlock purple_door_1 (in room_2) after having visited room_4.

- Need to handle the constraint about when in room_2, green_door_1 must be unlocked and holding purple_ball_1. So after returning to room_2, green_door_1 should be unlocked, and the agent must hold purple_ball_1.

But green_door_1 is between room_3 and room_4. To unlock it, the agent must be in room_4 or room_3. So after unlocking green_door_1 in room_4, then when back in room_2, green_door_1 is unlocked. But how does that relate to the agent being in room_2?

Wait, constraint 9 says: If you are in room_2 in any state, then at that state or after, green_door_1 is not locked and you are holding purple_ball_1. So when the agent is in room_2 (initially), they need to eventually unlock green_door_1 and hold purple_ball_1. But green_door_1 is in room_3 and room_4. So the agent must unlock green_door_1 (in room_4) and then return to room_2 with purple_ball_1.

But how to carry purple_ball_1 from room_2 to room_4 and back.

So steps:

- Start in room_2.

- Pick up purple_ball_1 (to later satisfy constraint 8 and 9).

- Unlock purple_door_2 (room_2's door to room_4).

- Go to room_4.

- Drop purple_ball_1 in room_4 (maybe to pick up grey_ball_1 or yellow_box_1).

- Unlock green_door_1 (room_4's door to room_3).

- Go to room_3.

- Unlock grey_door_1 (but need to have held purple_ball_1 before. But if the agent picked up purple_ball_1 earlier, then dropped it, but constraint 8 requires that when unlocking grey_door_1, there was a prior state where the agent held purple_ball_1. So as long as they held it before, even if they drop it later, that's okay.

But this is getting quite involved. Let me try to outline the plan step by step, considering all constraints.

Step-by-step plan outline:

1. Initial state: in room_2, holding nothing. All doors locked.

Constraints that need to be satisfied:

- At least once: grey_door_1 is locked (initially true).

- Whenever grey_door_1 is locked (which it is initially), agent must be in front of grey_box_2 and holding something. So need to go to room_4, goto grey_box_2, pick it up.

But to get to room_4, need to unlock purple_door_2.

So:

Action 1: gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_2 (since in room_2).

Action 2: pick purple_ball_1 room_2. Now holding purple_ball_1.

Action 3: gotodoor purple_door_2 room_2 room_4.

Action 4: toggle purple_door_2 (unlock it).

Action 5: gotoroom room_2 room_4 purple_door_2. Now in room_4.

Now, in room_4. Need to satisfy the constraint related to grey_door_1 being locked. So in some state after initial, when grey_door_1 is still locked (before we unlock it), agent must be in front of grey_box_2 and holding something. Since grey_door_1 is still locked until later steps, let's handle that now.

In room_4, grey_box_2 is present.

Action 6: gotoobject grey_box_2 room_4.

Action 7: pick grey_box_2 room_4. Now holding grey_box_2. This satisfies the constraint that when grey_door_1 is locked (still is), agent is in front of grey_box_2 and holding something.

Then, maybe drop it.

Action 8: drop grey_box_2 room_4. Now, hands free.

Also, need to handle the constraint that in some state, agent is holding yellow_box_1 and blue_ball_2 is in room_2. So need to get blue_ball_2 from room_3 to room_2.

To get to room_3, need to unlock green_door_1 (between room_4 and room_3). So:

Action 9: gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3.

Action 10: toggle green_door_1 (unlock it).

Action 11: gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1. Now in room_3.

In room_3, blue_ball_2 is present.

Action 12: gotoobject blue_ball_2 room_3.

Action 13: pick blue_ball_2 room_3.

Action 14: gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4.

Action 15: gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_1. Back to room_4.

Action 16: gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_2.

Action 17: gotoroom room_4 room_2 purple_door_2. Back to room_2.

Action 18: drop blue_ball_2 room_2. Now blue_ball_2 is in room_2.

Now, need to pick up yellow_box_1 (in room_4) while blue_ball_2 is in room_2.

So go back to room_4:

Action 19: gotodoor purple_door_2 room_2 room_4.

Action 20: toggle purple_door_2 (maybe locked again? Wait, no, we toggled it once to unlock, so it's unlocked now. Toggling again would lock it. But we need to keep it unlocked to go back. So perhaps this step is unnecessary. Wait, after action 4, purple_door_2 is unlocked. So actions 5-20: door remains unlocked unless toggled again.

But in action 19, the agent is going to room_4 again. So:

Action 19: gotoroom room_2 room_4 purple_door_2.

Now in room_4.

Action 20: gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_4.

Action 21: pick yellow_box_1 room_4.

Now, the agent is holding yellow_box_1, and blue_ball_2 is in room_2. This satisfies the third constraint.

Then, drop yellow_box_1 somewhere.

But need to handle other constraints.

Next, need to unlock purple_door_1 (constraint 5) and ensure that the agent was in room_4 before (which they were, multiple times).

So return to room_2:

Action 22: gotoroom room_4 room_2 purple_door_2.

Now in room_2. Need to unlock purple_door_1. But the agent is holding yellow_box_1. Need to drop it first to toggle the door.

Action 23: drop yellow_box_1 room_2.

Action 24: gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1.

Action 25: toggle purple_door_1 (unlock it). This satisfies constraint 5.

Now, constraint 6 is satisfied because the agent was in room_4 before unlocking purple_door_1.

Next, need to unlock grey_door_1. But to do that, the agent must have held purple_ball_1 before. The agent did pick up purple_ball_1 earlier (action 2), but then dropped it in room_4 (action 8? Wait, no. Let me check.

Wait, earlier steps: after action 2 (pick purple_ball_1), the agent then went to room_4 (action 5), then picked up grey_box_2 (action 7). Wait, no: after action 5 (go to room_4), the agent was in room_4, holding purple_ball_1? Because they picked it up in room_2 (action 2), then carried it to room_4.

Wait, no. When you go through a door, you drop any object? No, the "gotoroom" action doesn't drop objects. So when the agent picks up purple_ball_1 in room_2 (action 2), then goes to room_4 (action 5), they are still holding purple_ball_1. Then, when they pick up grey_box_2 (action 7), they can't because they're already holding purple_ball_1. Oh right! The "pick" action requires that you're not holding any object. So the previous steps are invalid. Oops, this is a mistake.

So the agent can't pick up grey_box_2 (action 7) while holding purple_ball_1. This is a problem. So the previous plan is flawed. So the agent must drop purple_ball_1 before picking up grey_box_2.

Let's correct that:

Revised steps:

Action 1: gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_2.

Action 2: pick purple_ball_1 room_2.

Action 3: gotodoor purple_door_2 room_2 room_4.

Action 4: toggle purple_door_2 (unlock).

Action 5: gotoroom room_2 room_4 purple_door_2. Now in room_4, holding purple_ball_1.

Action 6: drop purple_ball_1 room_4. Now free to pick up other objects.

Action 7: gotoobject grey_box_2 room_4.

Action 8: pick grey_box_2 room_4. Now holding grey_box_2.

Action 9: drop grey_box_2 room_4. (To free hands for other actions.)

Now, constraint 2 is satisfied: during the time when grey_door_1 is locked (which it still is), the agent was in front of grey_box_2 and holding an object (grey_box_2 in action 8).

Then proceed to unlock green_door_1.

Action 10: gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3.

Action 11: toggle green_door_1 (unlock).

Action 12: gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1. Now in room_3.

Action 13: gotoobject blue_ball_2 room_3.

Action 14: pick blue_ball_2 room_3.

Action 15: gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4.

Action 16: gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_1. Back to room_4.

Action 17: gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_2.

Action 18: gotoroom room_4 room_2 purple_door_2. Back to room_2.

Action 19: drop blue_ball_2 room_2. Now blue_ball_2 is in room_2.

Now, need to pick up yellow_box_1. So go back to room_4.

Action 20: gotoroom room_2 room_4 purple_door_2.

Action 21: gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_4.

Action 22: pick yellow_box_1 room_4. Now holding yellow_box_1.

This satisfies the third constraint (holding yellow_box_1 and blue_ball_2 is in room_2).

Action 23: drop yellow_box_1 room_4. (Optional, but need to proceed to other steps.)

Now, need to unlock purple_door_1 (constraint 5). But need to be in room_4 first (constraint 6). The agent has been in room_4 multiple times, so that's okay.

Action 24: gotoroom room_4 room_2 purple_door_2.

Action 25: gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1.

Action 26: toggle purple_door_1 (unlock it). Now constraint 5 is satisfied.

Now, need to handle grey_door_1. To unlock it, agent must have held purple_ball_1 before. The agent did pick up purple_ball_1 (action 2), then dropped it in room_4 (action 6). So that's okay.

Now, need to unlock grey_door_1. Grey_door_1 is in room_3 and room_1. So from room_3, agent can approach it.

So:

Action 27: gotoroom room_2 room_4 purple_door_2.

Action 28: gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1.

Action 29: gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1.

Action 30: toggle grey_door_1 (unlock it). Now, grey_door_1 is unlocked. This satisfies constraint 7.

But we need to be in front of grey_door_1 (which is in room_3) and have it unlocked for the goal. So after this, the agent is in front of grey_door_1, which is grey and unlocked. That satisfies the goal.

Additionally, when unlocking grey_door_1, the agent must have held purple_ball_1 earlier, which they did in action 2. So constraint 8 is satisfied.

Now, constraint 9: whenever the agent is in room_2 (which they were in actions 18, 19, 24-26), they need to have green_door_1 unlocked and holding purple_ball_1 at that state or after. Let's see:

After action 26, the agent is in room_2. At this point, green_door_1 is unlocked (action 11). But the agent is not holding purple_ball_1 (they dropped it in room_4, action 6). So to satisfy constraint 9, after being in room_2, they must hold purple_ball_1 again.

So after action 26, need to pick up purple_ball_1 again. But purple_ball_1 is in room_4. So:

Action 31: gotoroom room_2 room_4 purple_door_2.

Action 32: gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4.

Action 33: pick purple_ball_1 room_4. Now holding purple_ball_1.

Action 34: gotoroom room_4 room_2 purple_door_2. Back to room_2, holding purple_ball_1.

Now, in room_2, green_door_1 is unlocked, and agent is holding purple_ball_1. This satisfies constraint 9.

Finally, the goal is to be in front of a grey unlocked door. The agent is in room_2, but grey_door_1 is in room_3. So after unlocking grey_door_1 in action 30, the agent is in front of it in room_3. But they need to ensure that they are in front of it after unlocking.

But after action 30, the agent is in front of grey_door_1 in room_3, which is grey and now unlocked. So that's the goal.

So the final steps would be:

After unlocking grey_door_1 (action 30), the agent is already in front of it. So the goal is achieved.

But wait, after action 30, the agent is in room_3, in front of grey_door_1, which is grey and unlocked. That meets the goal.

But according to the plan outline, after unlocking grey_door_1, the agent needs to return to room_2 to handle constraint 9, but that's possible.

But let's make sure the sequence of actions covers all steps correctly.

Putting it all together, the plan would look like:

1. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_2
2. pick purple_ball_1 room_2
3. gotodoor purple_door_2 room_2 room_4
4. toggle purple_door_2
5. gotoroom room_2 room_4 purple_door_2
6. drop purple_ball_1 room_4
7. gotoobject grey_box_2 room_4
8. pick grey_box_2 room_4
9. drop grey_box_2 room_4
10. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3
11. toggle green_door_1
12. gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1
13. gotoobject blue_ball_2 room_3
14. pick blue_ball_2 room_3
15. gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4
16. gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_1
17. gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_2
18. gotoroom room_4 room_2 purple_door_2
19. drop blue_ball_2 room_2
20. gotoroom room_2 room_4 purple_door_2
21. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_4
22. pick yellow_box_1 room_4
23. drop yellow_box_1 room_4
24. gotoroom room_4 room_2 purple_door_2
25. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1
26. toggle purple_door_1
27. gotoroom room_2 room_4 purple_door_2
28. gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1
29. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1
30. toggle grey_door_1
31. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4
32. pick purple_ball_1 room_4
33. gotoroom room_4 room_2 purple_door_2

Wait, but after action 30, the agent is in room_3, in front of grey_door_1. So the goal is already met. The additional steps are to handle constraint 9. But maybe the agent can satisfy the goal earlier.

Let me re-examine the sequence.

After action 30: agent is in room_3, in front of grey_door_1, which is now unlocked and grey. This satisfies the goal. So the plan can end there, but need to check if all constraints are met.

But the agent also needs to handle constraint 9: after being in room_2 (which happens multiple times), in one of those instances, green_door_1 must be unlocked and agent must be holding purple_ball_1.

When the agent returns to room_2 after action 18, they are in room_2. At that point, green_door_1 is still locked. Because green_door_1 is unlocked in action 11. So after action 11, green_door_1 is unlocked. So when the agent is in room_2 after action 18, green_door_1 is unlocked (yes), but the agent isn't holding purple_ball_1. So they need to later hold purple_ball_1 while in room_2 or after. So steps 31-33 are needed.

But after action 30, the goal is already met. So perhaps the plan can end at action 30, but that leaves constraint 9 unsatisfied. Because after being in room_2 (action 24), the agent must have green_door_1 unlocked and hold purple_ball_1. So steps 31-33 are required.

But this is making the plan longer. The problem requires an optimal plan (shortest possible). So maybe there's a way to streamline.

Alternative approach:

After unlocking green_door_1 (action 11), when the agent is in room_3, they can proceed to unlock grey_door_1, provided they have held purple_ball_1 before. But they have held purple_ball_1 in action 2, dropped in action 6. So that's okay.

But after unlocking grey_door_1, the agent is in front of it, so the goal is achieved. However, they also need to satisfy constraint 9.

So after achieving the goal, the agent must return to room_2 and hold purple_ball_1 while green_door_1 is unlocked. But how?

Alternatively, when the agent is in room_2 after unlocking purple_door_1 (action 26), they need to go back to room_4, pick up purple_ball_1, and return to room_2. This would satisfy constraint 9.

But this adds steps. However, it's necessary.

So the full plan would include these steps.

But the optimal plan is the shortest possible. So perhaps there's a shorter way.

Wait, the agent can toggle grey_door_1 and be in front of it, which is the goal. So if the agent reaches that state, the goal is achieved, and the plan can end there. However, the other constraints must be satisfied in the process.

But some constraints require certain conditions in states after the goal is achieved. For example, constraint 9 says that whenever the agent is in room_2, they must later have green_door_1 unlocked and hold purple_ball_1. If the agent is in room_2 in the initial state and the goal is achieved without returning to room_2, then the constraint is not satisfied. But the agent starts in room_2, so they must, after that, have green_door_1 unlocked and hold purple_ball_1.

But in the initial state, the agent is in room_2. So according to constraint 9, they must, at that state or later, have green_door_1 unlocked and hold purple_ball_1. So even if the goal is achieved, the agent must still satisfy this constraint.

Therefore, the agent must ensure that after the initial state, they unlock green_door_1 and hold purple_ball_1 at some point.

But in the plan outlined earlier, when the agent unlocks green_door_1 (action 11), and later picks up purple_ball_1 again (action 32), then returns to room_2 (action 33), this satisfies the constraint.

So even though the goal is achieved earlier, the agent must still perform these steps to meet all constraints.

Thus, the plan needs to include these steps.

Now, the final step count may be long, but it's necessary to satisfy all constraints.

Putting it all together, the valid plan is as follows:

```
gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_2
pick purple_ball_1 room_2
gotodoor purple_door_2 room_2 room_4
toggle purple_door_2
gotoroom room_2 room_4 purple_door_2
drop purple_ball_1 room_4
gotoobject grey_box_2 room_4
pick grey_box_2 room_4
drop grey_box_2 room_4
gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3
toggle green_door_1
gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1
gotoobject blue_ball_2 room_3
pick blue_ball_2 room_3
gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4
gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_1
gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_2
gotoroom room_4 room_2 purple_door_2
drop blue_ball_2 room_2
gotoroom room_2 room_4 purple_door_2
gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_4
pick yellow_box_1 room_4
drop yellow_box_1 room_4
gotoroom room_4 room_2 purple_door_2
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1
toggle purple_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_4 purple_door_2
gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4
pick purple_ball_1 room_4
gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1
toggle grey_door_1
```

Let me check if this satisfies all constraints:

1. grey_door_1 is locked in at least one state: Yes, initially and until action 30.

2. When grey_door_1 is locked, agent must be in front of grey_box_2 and holding something: This is done in actions 7-8 (pick grey_box_2).

3. Holding yellow_box_1 and blue_ball_2 in room_2: action 22 (pick yellow_box_1) and blue_ball_2 is dropped in room_2 in action 19.

4. Never in room_1: Correct.

5. purple_door_1 not locked in at least one state: action 26 (toggle purple_door_1).

6. When purple_door_1 is unlocked, agent was in room_4 before: Yes, via actions 5 and others.

7. grey_door_1 not locked in at least one state: action 30.

8. When grey_door_1 is unlocked, agent held purple_ball_1 before: yes, via action 2 and 31.

9. At least one state in room_2: initial state. Then, after that, in action 18, 24, etc. The constraint is satisfied in action 33 (when agent returns to room_2 holding purple_ball_1 and green_door_1 is unlocked).

10. Hold grey_ball_1 and some object: But in the current plan, the agent picks grey_box_2, not grey_ball_1. Oh, there's a mistake here. The grey_ball_1 is in room_4. So to satisfy constraint 10, the agent must pick up grey_ball_1. So in room_4, after action 5, they should pick grey_ball_1 instead of grey_box_2.

Ah, this is a mistake. The constraint 10 requires holding grey_ball_1 and some object (which is redundant but required). So the agent must pick up grey_ball_1 at some point.

So revising steps:

After action 5 (in room_4), drop purple_ball_1, then goto grey_ball_1 (not grey_box_2).

Revised actions 6-8:

6. drop purple_ball_1 room_4

7. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_4

8. pick grey_ball_1 room_4

Then drop it:

9. drop grey_ball_1 room_4

This would satisfy constraint 10.

Then proceed to unlock green_door_1, etc.

So correcting the plan:

```
gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_2
pick purple_ball_1 room_2
gotodoor purple_door_2 room_2 room_4
toggle purple_door_2
gotoroom room_2 room_4 purple_door_2
drop purple_ball_1 room_4
gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_4
pick grey_ball_1 room_4
drop grey_ball_1 room_4
gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3
toggle green_door_1
gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1
gotoobject blue_ball_2 room_3
pick blue_ball_2 room_3
gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4
gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_1
gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_2
gotoroom room_4 room_2 purple_door_2
drop blue_ball_2 room_2
gotoroom room_2 room_4 purple_door_2
gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_4
pick yellow_box_1 room_4
drop yellow_box_1 room_4
gotoroom room_4 room_2 purple_door_2
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1
toggle purple_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_4 purple_door_2
gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4
pick purple_ball_1 room_4
gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1
toggle grey_door_1
```

Now, constraint 10 is satisfied in action 8 (holding grey_ball_1). Also, all other constraints are met.

This should be the correct plan.
