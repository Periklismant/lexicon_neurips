Let me analyze the problem step by step.

First, let's understand the initial state:
- I am in room_2
- Several objects are distributed across rooms
- All doors (purple_door_1, grey_door_1, purple_door_2, green_door_1) are locked
- I'm not holding any object

The goal is to reach a state where:
- There is a grey door that is unlocked and I'm in front of it

Let's identify the constraints:
1. "grey_door_1 is locked" must be true in at least one state (which is already satisfied in the initial state)
2. After "grey_door_1 is locked" holds, at some point I must be in front of grey_box_2 while holding some object
3. At some point, I must be holding yellow_box_1 while blue_ball_2 is in room_2
4. I can never be in room_1
5. At some point, purple_door_1 must be unlocked
6. Before purple_door_1 is unlocked, I must have been in room_4
7. At some point, grey_door_1 must be unlocked
8. Before grey_door_1 is unlocked, I must have been holding purple_ball_1
9. At some point, I must be in room_2 (already satisfied in the initial state)
10. After being in room_2, at some point green_door_1 must be unlocked and I must be holding purple_ball_1
11. At some point, I must be holding grey_ball_1 (which implies holding some object)

Looking at the constraints, I need to:
- Visit room_4 before unlocking purple_door_1
- Hold purple_ball_1 before unlocking grey_door_1
- Hold purple_ball_1 and unlock green_door_1 after being in room_2
- Hold grey_ball_1 at some point
- Be in front of grey_box_2 while holding something
- Hold yellow_box_1 while blue_ball_2 is in room_2
- Never enter room_1
- End up in front of a grey door that is unlocked

Let me think about a plan. I need to organize these constraints into a sequence of actions.

First, I'm in room_2 and have purple_ball_1 available. I can pick it up.

Let's think about moving blue_ball_2 to room_2. It's currently in room_3, so I need to access room_3. I have two potential paths:
1. room_2 -> room_1 -> room_3 (but I can't enter room_1 due to constraint 4)
2. room_2 -> room_4 -> room_3

So I need to go to room_4 first. This satisfies constraint 6 (being in room_4 before unlocking purple_door_1).

Let's sketch a high-level plan:
1. Pick up purple_ball_1 in room_2
2. Unlock purple_door_2 (connecting room_2 and room_4)
3. Go to room_4
4. Take yellow_box_1 from room_4
5. Unlock green_door_1 (connecting room_4 and room_3)
6. Go to room_3
7. Take blue_ball_2 from room_3
8. Go back to room_2 through room_4
9. Drop blue_ball_2 in room_2 (now blue_ball_2 is in room_2)
10. Go back to room_4
11. Be in front of grey_box_2 while holding yellow_box_1 (satisfying constraint 2)
12. Take grey_ball_1 from room_4 (satisfying constraint 11)
13. Unlock grey_door_1 (after holding purple_ball_1, satisfying constraint 8)
14. End up in front of grey_door_1, which is now unlocked (satisfying the goal)

But there might be an issue with this plan because it involves carrying multiple objects at once, which is not allowed. Let me revise the plan to account for this.

Actually, constraint 10 says that after being in room_2 (which I am in the initial state), at some point green_door_1 must be unlocked and I must be holding purple_ball_1. And constraint 8 says that before grey_door_1 is unlocked, I must have been holding purple_ball_1.

Let me refine the plan:

1. Pick up purple_ball_1 in room_2 (this sets up for constraints 8 and 10)
2. Go to the door purple_door_2
3. Unlock purple_door_2 (connecting room_2 and room_4)
4. Go to room_4 through purple_door_2 (this fulfills the prerequisite for constraint 6)
5. Go to the door green_door_1
6. Unlock green_door_1 while holding purple_ball_1 (this satisfies constraint 10)
7. Drop purple_ball_1 in room_4 (I need to free my hands to pick up other objects)
8. Pick up yellow_box_1 in room_4
9. Go to room_3 through green_door_1
10. Pick up blue_ball_2 in room_3 (but I can't, because I'm already holding yellow_box_1)

There's a problem with this approach. I need to ensure that at some point, "I am holding yellow_box_1 and blue_ball_2 is in room_2" (constraint 3). But I can only hold one object at a time.

Let me revise again:

1. Pick up purple_ball_1 in room_2
2. Go to the door purple_door_2
3. Unlock purple_door_2 (connecting room_2 and room_4)
4. Go to room_4 through purple_door_2 (this fulfills the prerequisite for constraint 6)
5. Go to the door green_door_1
6. Unlock green_door_1 while holding purple_ball_1 (this satisfies constraint 10)
7. Go to room_3 through green_door_1
8. Drop purple_ball_1 in room_3 (I need to free my hands)
9. Pick up blue_ball_2 in room_3
10. Go back to room_4 through green_door_1
11. Go to room_2 through purple_door_2
12. Drop blue_ball_2 in room_2 (now blue_ball_2 is in room_2)
13. Go back to room_4 through purple_door_2
14. Pick up yellow_box_1 in room_4 (now I'm holding yellow_box_1 and blue_ball_2 is in room_2, satisfying constraint 3)
15. Go to grey_box_2 in room_4 (now I'm in front of grey_box_2 while holding an object, satisfying constraint 2)
16. Drop yellow_box_1 in room_4
17. Pick up grey_ball_1 in room_4 (satisfying constraint 11)
18. Go back to room_3 through green_door_1
19. Pick up purple_ball_1 in room_3 (but I can't, because I'm already holding grey_ball_1)

Still having issues with the sequencing. Let me try again, considering that I need to fulfill the following requirements:
- Hold purple_ball_1 before unlocking grey_door_1
- Be in room_4 before unlocking purple_door_1
- Hold yellow_box_1 while blue_ball_2 is in room_2
- Be in front of grey_box_2 while holding something
- Hold grey_ball_1 at some point

Let me try a different approach:

1. Pick up purple_ball_1 in room_2
2. Go to the door purple_door_2
3. Unlock purple_door_2 (connecting room_2 and room_4)
4. Go to room_4 through purple_door_2 (now I've been in room_4, satisfying prerequisite for constraint 6)
5. Go back to room_2 through purple_door_2
6. Go to the door purple_door_1
7. Unlock purple_door_1 (satisfying constraint 5, and this is valid since I've been in room_4)
8. Go to the door purple_door_2 again
9. Go to room_4 through purple_door_2
10. Go to the door green_door_1
11. Unlock green_door_1 while holding purple_ball_1 (satisfying constraint 10)
12. Go to room_3 through green_door_1
13. Drop purple_ball_1 in room_3 (I need to free my hands)
14. Pick up blue_ball_2 in room_3
15. Go back to room_4 through green_door_1
16. Go to room_2 through purple_door_2
17. Drop blue_ball_2 in room_2 (now blue_ball_2 is in room_2)
18. Go back to room_4 through purple_door_2
19. Pick up yellow_box_1 in room_4 (now I'm holding yellow_box_1 and blue_ball_2 is in room_2, satisfying constraint 3)
20. Go to grey_box_2 in room_4 (now I'm in front of grey_box_2 while holding an object, satisfying constraint 2)
21. Drop yellow_box_1 in room_4
22. Pick up grey_ball_1 in room_4 (satisfying constraint 11)
23. Go back to room_3 through green_door_1
24. Pick up purple_ball_1 in room_3 (but I can't, because I'm already holding grey_ball_1)

I'm still having sequencing issues. Let's reorganize the constraints and plan more carefully.

The most critical part seems to be the correct sequencing of when to hold which objects. Let me try again:

1. I start in room_2 with purple_ball_1.
2. I need to pick up purple_ball_1 for multiple constraints.
3. I need to visit room_4 before unlocking purple_door_1.
4. After being in room_2, I must unlock green_door_1 while holding purple_ball_1.
5. At some point, I need blue_ball_2 (from room_3) to be in room_2.
6. At some point, I need to hold yellow_box_1 (from room_4) while blue_ball_2 is in room_2.
7. I need to be in front of grey_box_2 while holding some object.
8. I need to hold grey_ball_1 at some point.
9. I need to unlock grey_door_1 after having held purple_ball_1.
10. I need to end up in front of an unlocked grey door.

Let me try a new sequence:

1. Gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_2
2. Pick purple_ball_1 room_2 (now I'm holding purple_ball_1)
3. Gotodoor purple_door_2 room_2 room_4
4. Toggle purple_door_2 (unlock purple_door_2)
5. Gotoroom room_2 room_4 purple_door_2 (now I've been in room_4, satisfying prerequisite for constraint 6)
6. Gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3
7. Toggle green_door_1 (unlock green_door_1 while holding purple_ball_1, satisfying constraint 10)
8. Gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1
9. Gotoempty (to find an empty spot in room_3)
10. Drop purple_ball_1 room_3 (I need to free my hands)
11. Gotoobject blue_ball_2 room_3
12. Pick blue_ball_2 room_3
13. Gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4
14. Gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_1
15. Gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_2
16. Gotoroom room_4 room_2 purple_door_2
17. Gotoempty
18. Drop blue_ball_2 room_2 (now blue_ball_2 is in room_2)
19. Gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1
20. Toggle purple_door_1 (unlocking purple_door_1, satisfying constraint 5)
21. Gotodoor purple_door_2 room_2 room_4
22. Gotoroom room_2 room_4 purple_door_2
23. Gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_4
24. Pick yellow_box_1 room_4 (now I'm holding yellow_box_1 while blue_ball_2 is in room_2, satisfying constraint 3)
25. Gotoobject grey_box_2 room_4 (now I'm in front of grey_box_2 while holding an object, satisfying constraint 2)
26. Gotoempty
27. Drop yellow_box_1 room_4
28. Gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_4
29. Pick grey_ball_1 room_4 (satisfying constraint 11)
30. Gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3
31. Gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1
32. Gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_3
33. Gotoempty
34. Drop grey_ball_1 room_3
35. Pick purple_ball_1 room_3 (now holding purple_ball_1 again)
36. Gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1
37. Toggle grey_door_1 (unlocking grey_door_1 after having held purple_ball_1, satisfying constraint 8)
38. Gotoempty
39. Drop purple_ball_1 room_3 (I need free hands again)
40. Gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_3
41. Pick grey_ball_1 room_3
42. Gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1 (now I'm in front of grey_door_1, which is unlocked, satisfying the goal)

But there's an issue: constraint 4 says I can never be in room_1, but grey_door_1 connects room_3 and room_1. This means I need to end up in front of grey_door_1 from room_3, without going to room_1.

Let me review the doors in the problem:
- purple_door_1 connects room_1 and room_2
- grey_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3
- purple_door_2 connects room_2 and room_4
- green_door_1 connects room_3 and room_4

So the grey door in the problem is grey_door_1, which connects room_1 and room_3. The goal is to be in front of an unlocked grey door, and grey_door_1 is the only grey door.

Given constraint 4 (never enter room_1), I need to be in front of grey_door_1 from the room_3 side.

Let me refine the plan again:

1. Gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_2
2. Pick purple_ball_1 room_2 (now I'm holding purple_ball_1)
3. Gotodoor purple_door_2 room_2 room_4
4. Toggle purple_door_2 (unlock purple_door_2)
5. Gotoroom room_2 room_4 purple_door_2 (now I've been in room_4, satisfying prerequisite for constraint 6)
6. Gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3
7. Toggle green_door_1 (unlock green_door_1 while holding purple_ball_1, satisfying constraint 10)
8. Gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1
9. Gotoempty (to find an empty spot in room_3)
10. Drop purple_ball_1 room_3 (I need to free my hands)
11. Gotoobject blue_ball_2 room_3
12. Pick blue_ball_2 room_3
13. Gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4
14. Gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_1
15. Gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_2
16. Gotoroom room_4 room_2 purple_door_2
17. Gotoempty
18. Drop blue_ball_2 room_2 (now blue_ball_2 is in room_2)
19. Gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1
20. Toggle purple_door_1 (unlocking purple_door_1, satisfying constraint 5)
21. Gotodoor purple_door_2 room_2 room_4
22. Gotoroom room_2 room_4 purple_door_2
23. Gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_4
24. Pick yellow_box_1 room_4 (now I'm holding yellow_box_1 while blue_ball_2 is in room_2, satisfying constraint 3)
25. Gotoobject grey_box_2 room_4 (now I'm in front of grey_box_2 while holding an object, satisfying constraint 2)
26. Gotoempty
27. Drop yellow_box_1 room_4
28. Gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_4
29. Pick grey_ball_1 room_4 (satisfying constraint 11)
30. Gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3
31. Gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1
32. Gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_3
33. Gotoempty
34. Drop grey_ball_1 room_3
35. Pick purple_ball_1 room_3 (now holding purple_ball_1 again)
36. Gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1
37. Toggle grey_door_1 (unlocking grey_door_1 after having held purple_ball_1, satisfying constraint 8)
38. Gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1 (now I'm in front of grey_door_1, which is unlocked, satisfying the goal)

I've reviewed the plan again, and I think it's valid now. 

Actually, let me check if the constraint "grey_door_1 is locked" must be true at some point is satisfied. It is, since grey_door_1 starts locked. 

Let me quickly trace through the plan to make sure it satisfies all the constraints:

1. "grey_door_1 is locked" must be true in at least one state (satisfied in the initial state)
2. After "grey_door_1 is locked" holds, at some point I must be in front of grey_box_2 while holding some object (satisfied in step 25)
3. At some point, I must be holding yellow_box_1 while blue_ball_2 is in room_2 (satisfied in step 24)
4. I can never be in room_1 (satisfied, I never enter room_1)
5. At some point, purple_door_1 must be unlocked (satisfied in step 20)
6. Before purple_door_1 is unlocked, I must have been in room_4 (satisfied, I visit room_4 in step 5)
7. At some point, grey_door_1 must be unlocked (satisfied in step 37)
8. Before grey_door_1 is unlocked, I must have been holding purple_ball_1 (satisfied, I hold purple_ball_1 in steps 2-10 and again in steps 35-37)
9. At some point, I must be in room_2 (satisfied in the initial state and multiple other steps)
10. After being in room_2, at some point green_door_1 must be unlocked and I must be holding purple_ball_1 (satisfied in step 7)
11. At some point, I must be holding grey_ball_1 (satisfied in steps 29-34)

The goal state is reached in step 38, where I'm in front of grey_door_1, which is unlocked.

The plan looks valid. Let me format it according to the expected format:

```
Gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_2
Pick purple_ball_1 room_2
Gotodoor purple_door_2 room_2 room_4
Toggle purple_door_2
Gotoroom room_2 room_4 purple_door_2
Gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3
Toggle green_door_1
Gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1
Gotoempty
Drop purple_ball_1 room_3
Gotoobject blue_ball_2 room_3
Pick blue_ball_2 room_3
Gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4
Gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_1
Gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_2
Gotoroom room_4 room_2 purple_door_2
Gotoempty
Drop blue_ball_2 room_2
Gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1
Toggle purple_door_1
Gotodoor purple_door_2 room_2 room_4
Gotoroom room_2 room_4 purple_door_2
Gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_4
Pick yellow_box_1 room_4
Gotoobject grey_box_2 room_4
Gotoempty
Drop yellow_box_1 room_4
Gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_4
Pick grey_ball_1 room_4
Gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3
Gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1
Gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_3
Gotoempty
Drop grey_ball_1 room_3
Pick purple_ball_1 room_3
Gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1
Toggle grey_door_1
Gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1
```

Actually, I'm noticing something important again. The constraint that "you are holding grey_ball_1" and "you are holding some object" seems redundant but actually suggests that I need to be holding grey_ball_1 at the same time as being in a state of "holding some object." But that's impossible because I can only hold one object at a time. Let me re-read that constraint:

"The following expression must hold in at least one state: The following conditions are all true: "you are holding grey_ball_1", "you are holding some object""

This seems to be stating that at some point, I must be holding grey_ball_1 (which implies I'm holding some object). So the constraint is simply that I need to hold grey_ball_1 at some point, which is already satisfied in my plan.

To double-check, let me go through the sequence of actions in the plan to make sure everything works as expected:

1. Gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_2
2. Pick purple_ball_1 room_2 (now I'm holding purple_ball_1)
3. Gotodoor purple_door_2 room_2 room_4
4. Toggle purple_door_2 (unlock purple_door_2)
5. Gotoroom room_2 room_4 purple_door_2 (now I've been in room_4, satisfying prerequisite for constraint 6)
6. Gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3
7. Toggle green_door_1 (unlock green_door_1 while holding purple_ball_1, satisfying constraint 10)
8. Gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1
9. Gotoempty (to find an empty spot in room_3)
10. Drop purple_ball_1 room_3 (I need to free my hands)
11. Gotoobject blue_ball_2 room_3
12. Pick blue_ball_2 room_3
13. Gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4
14. Gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_1
15. Gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_2
16. Gotoroom room_4 room_2 purple_door_2
17. Gotoempty
18. Drop blue_ball_2 room_2 (now blue_ball_2 is in room_2)
19. Gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1
20. Toggle purple_door_1 (unlocking purple_door_1, satisfying constraint 5)
21. Gotodoor purple_door_2 room_2 room_4
22. Gotoroom room_2 room_4 purple_door_2
23. Gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_4
24. Pick yellow_box_1 room_4 (now I'm holding yellow_box_1 while blue_ball_2 is in room_2, satisfying constraint 3)
25. Gotoobject grey_box_2 room_4 (now I'm in front of grey_box_2 while holding an object, satisfying constraint 2)
26. Gotoempty
27. Drop yellow_box_1 room_4
28. Gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_4
29. Pick grey_ball_1 room_4 (satisfying constraint 11)
30. Gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3
31. Gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1
32. Gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_3
33. Gotoempty
34. Drop grey_ball_1 room_3
35. Pick purple_ball_1 room_3 (now holding purple_ball_1 again)
36. Gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1
37. Toggle grey_door_1 (unlocking grey_door_1 after having held purple_ball_1, satisfying constraint 8)
38. Gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1 (now I'm in front of grey_door_1, which is unlocked, satisfying the goal)

This looks correct to me. Let me submit this plan as the solution.

```

```

Actually, let's review the problem statement once more to make sure my plan is correct. 

The goal is: "There is a door d such that "The following conditions are all true: "d is grey", "you are in front of d", "d is not locked"""

Based on the objects list, I see that there is only one grey door: grey_door_1. So indeed, the goal is to be in front of grey_door_1 when it's unlocked. Grey_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3, so I must be in front of it from the room_3 side (since I can't enter room_1).

Let me review all the constraints again:

1. "grey_door_1 is locked" must be true in at least one state (satisfied in the initial state)
2. After "grey_door_1 is locked" holds, at some point I must be in front of grey_box_2 while holding some object (satisfied in step 25)
3. At some point, I must be holding yellow_box_1 while blue_ball_2 is in room_2 (satisfied in step 24)
4. I can never be in room_1 (satisfied, I never enter room_1)
5. At some point, purple_door_1 must be unlocked (satisfied in step 20)
6. Before purple_door_1 is unlocked, I must have been in room_4 (satisfied, I visit room_4 in step 5)
7. At some point, grey_door_1 must be unlocked (satisfied in step 37)
8. Before grey_door_1 is unlocked, I must have been holding purple_ball_1 (satisfied, I hold purple_ball_1 in steps 2-10 and again in steps 35-37)
9. At some point, I must be in room_2 (satisfied in the initial state and multiple other steps)
10. After being in room_2, at some point green_door_1 must be unlocked and I must be holding purple_ball_1 (satisfied in step 7)
11. At some point, I must be holding grey_ball_1 (satisfied in steps 29-34)

I believe the plan is correct as stated. Let me format it as required:
