Okay, let's tackle this planning problem step by step. The goal is to get a red box into room_2, be in room_2 in front of it. But there are a bunch of constraints to satisfy. Let's break down the problem.

First, the initial state: I'm in room_4. All doors are locked. The red boxes are in room_2 (red_box_1) and room_3 has red_balls. The boxes in room_1 are blue and green. The goal requires a red box in room_2, which is already there (red_box_1). So maybe I just need to get to room_2 and be in front of it. But wait, I need to check if the initial state already meets the goal. The goal is "there exists a box v such that v is red, in room_2, you are in room_2, and in front of v". Since red_box_1 is in room_2, if I can get to room_2 and be in front of it, that's the goal. So the main task is navigating to room_2 and position in front of red_box_1. But all doors are locked, so I need to unlock doors to move around.

Constraints are the tricky part. Let's list them:

1. Must hold an object at least once.
2. grey_door_1 is locked in some state.
3. If grey_door_1 is locked in state s, then either green_door_1 is unlocked or I'm in front of yellow_door_1 at s or after.
4. grey_door_1 must be unlocked in some state.
5. If grey_door_1 is unlocked, then in an earlier state, I was in room_3 or holding red_ball_2.
6. Must be in room_3 holding red_ball_1 at some point.
7. Must be in front of grey_door_1.
8. If in front of grey_door_1, then earlier held yellow_box_1.
9. Must be in front of blue_box_1.
10. Must be in room_4 at some state.
11. If in room_4, then either in room_1 or red_door_1 is unlocked in that state or after.

Starting from room_4. Let's outline the steps needed.

First, I need to unlock doors. But to toggle a door, I need to be in front of it. So to unlock a door, I have to go to it, which might require moving through other doors. But all doors are locked initially. Wait, but how do I move? Because to move through a door, it needs to be unlocked. But all doors are locked, so I can't leave room_4 unless I unlock a door. But to unlock a door, I need to be in front of it, which requires being in one of the rooms connected by that door. So in room_4, the doors connected are grey_door_1 (to room_2) and green_door_1 (to room_3). So I can go to either door in room_4, toggle it to unlock, then go through.

But let's see the initial state: I'm in room_4. The doors from room_4 are grey_door_1 (connects room_2 and room_4) and green_door_1 (connects room_3 and room_4). Both are locked. So first step: goto the door in room_4. Let's pick grey_door_1. But to go to grey_door_1 in room_4, I need to check if there's any object blocking it. The initial state in room_4 has yellow_box_2. If yellow_box_2 is blocking the door, then I can't go to grey_door_1. Wait, the preconditions for "goto door" require that there's no object blocking the position in front of the door in the current room. So if in room_4, the position in front of grey_door_1 is blocked by yellow_box_2, then I can't go to grey_door_1. Similarly for green_door_1.

Looking at the initial objects in room_4: yellow_box_2 is there. So if the doors in room_4 are blocked by objects, I can't go to them. Wait, the problem says that objects may block doors. The initial state doesn't mention any door being blocked. The 'effects' of picking an object mention that if x was blocking a door, then it's no longer blocking. So perhaps the initial state doesn't have any objects blocking doors. Therefore, in room_4, the positions in front of grey_door_1 and green_door_1 are not blocked. So I can go to those doors.

So first, go to grey_door_1 in room_4: gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_2. Then toggle it to unlock. Then go through to room_2. But wait, the grey_door_1 connects room_4 and room_2. So after unlocking, I can go from room_4 to room_2 via grey_door_1. But in room_2, there's yellow_box_1 and red_box_1. But maybe the path is possible.

Wait, but after unlocking grey_door_1, we need to satisfy the constraints. Let's check the constraints:

Constraint 2: grey_door_1 is locked in some state. Initially, it's locked. So that's already satisfied. But constraint 3: whenever grey_door_1 is locked in a state s, then in s or after, green_door_1 is not locked or I'm in front of yellow_door_1. Initially, grey_door_1 is locked, so after the initial state, we need to ensure that either green_door_1 is unlocked or I'm in front of yellow_door_1. But if I unlock grey_door_1, then in the state after that, grey_door_1 is unlocked. But the initial state has grey_door_1 locked, so the constraint 3 is triggered. So to satisfy this, after the initial state (where grey_door_1 is locked), in some later state, either green_door_1 is unlocked or I'm in front of yellow_door_1. So maybe after unlocking grey_door_1, I need to unlock green_door_1 as well. Or go to yellow_door_1.

But let's proceed step by step.

The plan needs to include steps that satisfy all constraints.

Constraint 6: must be in room_3 holding red_ball_1. So at some point, I need to go to room_3, pick up red_ball_1. But how? To get to room_3 from room_4, I need to use green_door_1. But green_door_1 is locked. So I need to unlock it. To do that, I need to be in front of it. So from room_4, I can go to green_door_1 (gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3), then toggle it. Then go to room_3. But perhaps there's a way to do that.

But let's outline the steps:

1. From room_4, go to green_door_1 (room4 to room3 door). But is that possible? The door connects room3 and room4, so in room4, green_door_1 is present. So gotodoor green_door_1 room4 room3. Then toggle to unlock. Then go to room3 via green_door_1. Once in room3, pick up red_ball_1. But to pick it up, I need to be in front of it. So gotoobject red_ball_1 room3, then pick. Then, maybe drop it later to fulfill the holding constraint.

But also, constraint 8: if I'm in front of grey_door_1 (which is needed for constraint7), then I must have held yellow_box_1 earlier. So I need to have picked up yellow_box_1 in room2. But how to get to room2? From room4, via grey_door_1. So maybe:

- Unlock grey_door_1 first.

Wait, but initial plan:

Starting in room4.

Step 1: gotodoor grey_door_1 room4 room2 (precondition: in room4, door connects room4 to room2, and no object blocking. Since initial state has yellow_box_2 in room4, but unless the box is in front of the door, it's not blocked. Assuming the boxes are placed such that they don't block the doors, the action is possible.

Then toggle grey_door_1 (since it's locked, toggling unlocks it). Now grey_door_1 is unlocked.

Then, gotoroom room4 room2 grey_door_1. Now in room2.

In room2, there's yellow_box_1 and red_box_1. The goal is to be in front of red_box_1. So gotoobject red_box_1 room2. Then drop something if needed. But the goal requires that you are in front of a red box in room2. So if I'm in room2 and in front of red_box_1, that's the goal. But I need to make sure that the constraints are satisfied.

But let's check the constraints again:

Constraint 6: need to be in room3 holding red_ball_1. So even if the main goal is achieved without going to room3, this constraint requires that at some point I'm there holding red_ball_1. So I need to include that in the plan.

Constraint 5: if grey_door_1 is unlocked in some state, then earlier I was in room3 or holding red_ball_2. Since we have to unlock grey_door_1 (constraint4 requires that grey_door_1 is unlocked at some point), then we need to have either been in room3 or held red_ball_2 before unlocking it. But in the current steps, unlocking grey_door_1 is done early. So maybe we need to first go to room3, pick up red_ball_2, then unlock grey_door_1.

But how to get to room3? From room4, via green_door_1, but green_door_1 is locked. So need to unlock it.

So plan steps:

1. From room4, go to green_door_1 (gotodoor green_door_1 room4 room3).
2. Toggle green_door_1 to unlock.
3. Gotoroom room4 room3 green_door_1. Now in room3.
4. Gotoobject red_ball_1 room3.
5. Pick red_ball_1 room3. (This satisfies constraint6)
6. Then, maybe drop it, but need to hold something else for other constraints.
7. Now, need to unlock grey_door_1. But to do that, I need to go back to room4, then to grey_door_1. But room3 and room4 are connected via green_door_1, which is now unlocked. So go back to room4 via green_door_1.

Wait, but if I'm in room3, and I need to unlock grey_door_1, which is in room4 and room2. So to get to grey_door_1, I need to be in room4. So:

7. Gotoroom room3 room4 green_door_1. Now back in room4.
8. Gotodoor grey_door_1 room4 room2.
9. Toggle grey_door_1 (unlock it). Now, when we toggle, the door is unlocked. Now, this action satisfies constraint4 (grey_door_1 is unlocked). But constraint5 requires that before this, either I was in room3 or held red_ball_2. In step5, I held red_ball_1. Not red_ball_2. So this might not satisfy constraint5. Oh, right, constraint5 requires that if grey_door_1 is unlocked in a state, then earlier I was in room3 or held red_ball_2. But in step9, when we unlock grey_door_1, we need to have prior state where either in room3 (which steps3-7 do) or held red_ball_2. Since step3-7 are in room3, that's covered. So the earlier state of being in room3 (steps3-7) satisfies the condition for constraint5.

So step9 (unlocking grey_door_1) is allowed because we were in room3 earlier.

Then proceed to room2:

10. Gotoroom room4 room2 grey_door_1. Now in room2.

11. Now, need to be in front of red_box_1. So gotoobject red_box_1 room2.

But the goal requires that I'm in room2 and in front of a red box. So step11 would satisfy that. But also, the main goal is achieved here. However, there are other constraints to check.

Constraint7: must be in front of grey_door_1. So at some point, need to be in front of grey_door_1. Which could be in room4 or room2. For example, in step8, we were in front of grey_door_1 in room4. But after step10, we are in room2, so to be in front of grey_door_1 again, we need to go back to room4 or room2's door. Wait, grey_door_1 connects room2 and room4. So in room2, can we go to grey_door_1? Yes, if it's accessible. So in room2, gotodoor grey_door_1 room2 room4. Then that's being in front of grey_door_1. But according to constraint8, when we are in front of grey_door_1, we must have held yellow_box_1 earlier. So before this step, we need to have picked up yellow_box_1.

Yellow_box_1 is in room2. So after arriving in room2 (step10), pick up yellow_box_1.

But wait, after step10, we are in room2. Let's adjust steps:

After step10: in room2.

Step11: gotoobject yellow_box_1 room2.

Step12: pick yellow_box_1 room2. Now holding yellow_box_1.

Step13: gotoempty (to drop it somewhere else? Or drop it in room2. But need to satisfy constraint8: if in front of grey_door_1, then earlier held yellow_box_1. So step11-12 would have held yellow_box_1.

Then, step14: gotodoor grey_door_1 room2 room4. Now in front of grey_door_1 in room2. This satisfies constraint7 (being in front of grey_door_1) and constraint8 (earlier held yellow_box_1).

But wait, step14 would be in room2, front of grey_door_1. Then maybe drop the yellow_box_1 here, but not necessary. But need to also satisfy constraint1: must hold an object at least once. Which is satisfied by step12 (holding yellow_box_1).

Also, constraint9: must be in front of blue_box_1. Blue_box_1 is in room1. So need to go to room1 and be in front of it. But room1 is connected to room2 via yellow_door_1 and to room3 via red_door_1. But those doors are locked initially.

So after being in room2, need to unlock yellow_door_1 to go to room1. Let's see:

To unlock yellow_door_1, which connects room1 and room2. So from room2, gotodoor yellow_door_1 room2 room1. Then toggle to unlock. Then go to room1. Then gotoobject blue_box_1 room1. That satisfies constraint9.

So steps:

After step14 (in front of grey_door_1 in room2), proceed to unlock yellow_door_1.

Step15: gotodoor yellow_door_1 room2 room1.

Step16: toggle yellow_door_1 (unlock it).

Step17: gotoroom room2 room1 yellow_door_1. Now in room1.

Step18: gotoobject blue_box_1 room1. This satisfies constraint9.

But then need to return to room2 to be in front of red_box_1. So step19: gotoroom room1 room2 yellow_door_1.

Step20: gotoobject red_box_1 room2. Now, in room2, front of red_box_1. This meets the goal.

But we also need to handle constraint3: whenever grey_door_1 is locked in a state, then either green_door_1 is unlocked or in front of yellow_door_1 at that state or after. Initially, grey_door_1 is locked. So after the initial state, we need to ensure that either green_door_1 is unlocked or in front of yellow_door_1. But in step2, we unlocked green_door_1. So after the initial state, green_door_1 is unlocked in step3. So when grey_door_1 is locked (initially), after that, green_door_1 is unlocked (step3). So that satisfies constraint3.

Other constraints:

Constraint10: must be in room4. Initially, we are in room4. So the initial state already satisfies this. But constraint11 says that if in room4 (at any point), then either you are in room1 or red_door_1 is unlocked in that state or after. Initially in room4, so need to ensure that either later go to room1 or unlock red_door_1. But in the steps above, after room4, we go to room3, then back to room4, then to room2, then room1. So when in room4 (steps7), after that, we go to room2. But in step7, after being in room4, the plan doesn't go to room1, but red_door_1 is locked. Wait, red_door_1 connects room1 and room3. So if we don't unlock red_door_1, then when in room4, constraint11 requires that after that state, either in room1 or red_door_1 is unlocked. So during the plan, after being in room4 (step7), we need to either unlock red_door_1 or go to room1. But in the current plan, after step7, we unlock grey_door_1 and proceed to room2. Then later go to room1 via yellow_door_1. So when in room4 (step7), the next steps are to room2, then room1. So after being in room4 (step7), eventually, we go to room1 (step17). So this satisfies constraint11, because after step7, in the plan, we eventually reach room1. So constraint11 is satisfied.

But need to verify. The constraint says: if you are in room4 in state s, then in s or after, either you are in room1 or red_door_1 is unlocked. So after step7 (being in room4), the plan proceeds to unlock grey_door_1, go to room2, then unlock yellow_door_1, go to room1. So after step7, eventually, we are in room1. So that satisfies the constraint.

Now, let's check all constraints:

1. Holding an object: yes (steps5 and 12).
2. grey_door_1 is locked in some state: initially true.
3. Whenever grey_door_1 is locked (initially), then green_door_1 is unlocked (step3) after that.
4. grey_door_1 is unlocked (step9).
5. When grey_door_1 is unlocked (step9), earlier state was in room3 (steps3-7).
6. In room3 holding red_ball_1 (steps3-5).
7. In front of grey_door_1 (steps8 and14).
8. When in front of grey_door_1 (steps8 and14), earlier held yellow_box_1 (step12).
9. In front of blue_box_1 (step18).
10. In room4 (steps0,7).
11. When in room4 (step7), after that, go to room1 (step17).

All constraints seem satisfied.

But let's check the steps again to ensure the plan is optimal (shortest possible).

The steps as outlined are:

1. gotodoor green_door_1 room4 room3
2. toggle green_door_1
3. gotoroom room4 room3 green_door_1
4. gotoobject red_ball_1 room3
5. pick red_ball_1 room3
6. gotoroom room3 room4 green_door_1
7. gotodoor grey_door_1 room4 room2
8. toggle grey_door_1
9. gotoroom room4 room2 grey_door_1
10. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room2
11. pick yellow_box_1 room2
12. gotodoor grey_door_1 room2 room4
13. gotoempty (maybe not needed; can directly go to next step)
14. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room2 room1
15. toggle yellow_door_1
16. gotoroom room2 room1 yellow_door_1
17. gotoobject blue_box_1 room1
18. gotoroom room1 room2 yellow_door_1
19. gotoobject red_box_1 room2

But wait, after step19, we are in front of red_box_1 in room2, which is the goal. But maybe some steps can be optimized.

Alternative approach: After picking red_ball_1 in room3, perhaps drop it later, but not necessary. Also, after picking yellow_box_1 in room2, we need to be in front of grey_door_1. So maybe after step11 (picking yellow_box_1), go to grey_door_1 in room2, then proceed.

But let's see:

Another possible shortcut: After step9 (arrive in room2), go to yellow_box_1, pick it up, then go to grey_door_1 in room2 (satisfy constraint7 and8), then go to yellow_door_1, unlock, go to room1, then return to room2 and be in front of red_box_1.

But also, the goal requires being in room2 in front of red_box_1, which is already in room2. So perhaps the steps can be shorter.

But considering all constraints, the steps outlined earlier cover all required points.

But let's count the steps:

1. gotodoor green_door_1 room4 room3
2. toggle green_door_1
3. gotoroom room4 room3 green_door_1
4. gotoobject red_ball_1 room3
5. pick red_ball_1 room3
6. gotoroom room3 room4 green_door_1
7. gotodoor grey_door_1 room4 room2
8. toggle grey_door_1
9. gotoroom room4 room2 grey_door_1
10. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room2
11. pick yellow_box_1 room2
12. gotodoor grey_door_1 room2 room4
13. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room2 room1
14. toggle yellow_door_1
15. gotoroom room2 room1 yellow_door_1
16. gotoobject blue_box_1 room1
17. gotoroom room1 room2 yellow_door_1
18. gotoobject red_box_1 room2

That's 18 steps. But maybe some steps can be merged or optimized.

Wait, after step9, you are in room2. To pick yellow_box_1, step10 is gotoobject, step11 pick. Then step12 gotodoor grey_door_1. So steps10-12.

Then, after step12 (in front of grey_door_1 in room2), need to go to yellow_door_1. So step13: gotodoor yellow_door_1 room2 room1. Then toggle, etc.

But perhaps after step12, we can directly go to yellow_door_1.

But perhaps the plan can be made shorter. For example:

After step9 (in room2):

10. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room2
11. pick yellow_box_1
12. gotodoor grey_door_1 room2 room4 (satisfies constraint7)
13. drop yellow_box_1 room4 (but need to be in front of an empty spot to drop. Wait, after step12, you are in front of grey_door_1 in room2. To drop, you need to be in room2, but you can't drop in front of the door if it's occupied. But maybe after step12, you can gotoempty, then drop. But this adds steps.

Alternatively, after step12, maybe proceed to unlock yellow_door_1:

13. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room2 room1
14. toggle yellow_door_1
15. gotoroom room2 room1 yellow_door_1
16. gotoobject blue_box_1 room1
17. gotoroom room1 room2 yellow_door_1
18. gotoobject red_box_1 room2

But then step13 is after step12. So total steps would be 18.

Alternatively, after step9 (in room2), can I go directly to red_box_1 and finish? No, because need to satisfy constraints like being in front of grey_door_1, holding yellow_box_1, etc.

Another angle: The main goal is to be in room2 in front of red_box_1. But the red_box_1 is already in room2. So all I need is to get to room2 and position in front of it. But the constraints require other steps.

Wait, if the initial state has red_box_1 in room2, but I'm in room4. So I need to navigate to room2. But all doors are locked. So I have to unlock doors to get there. But the initial plan seems necessary.

But perhaps there's a shorter path. Let me think:

Start in room4. Need to unlock grey_door_1 to get to room2. But to unlock grey_door_1, must be in front of it. So:

1. gotodoor grey_door_1 room4 room2
2. toggle grey_door_1 (unlocks)
3. gotoroom room4 room2 grey_door_1
4. gotoobject red_box_1 room2

But this would be 4 steps, but doesn't satisfy the other constraints. For example, constraint6 requires being in room3 holding red_ball_1. Also, constraint5 requires that when grey_door_1 is unlocked, earlier state was in room3 or holding red_ball_2. But in this plan, unlocking grey_door_1 (step2) is done without having been in room3 or holding red_ball_2. So this violates constraint5. So this plan is invalid.

Thus, the longer plan is necessary to satisfy all constraints.

Therefore, the earlier plan with 18 steps is required. But maybe there's a way to optimize further.

Wait, after step5 (picking red_ball_1), do we need to carry it further? Or can we drop it somewhere. For constraint6, just holding it once is enough. So perhaps:

After step5, drop red_ball_1 in room3.

Step6: drop red_ball_1 room3. But to drop, need to be in front of empty position. So after step5, you're holding red_ball_1. Then gotoempty in room3, then drop. So steps:

5. pick red_ball_1 room3
6. gotoempty room3
7. drop red_ball_1 room3

But this adds steps but allows us to free hands. But then, when we need to hold yellow_box_1 later, we can pick it up. But this adds steps. Maybe it's better to keep holding red_ball_1 until needed. But the constraint6 is satisfied once we are in room3 holding red_ball_1 (step5).

So perhaps after step5, we can proceed to go back to room4, then unlock grey_door_1, etc.

But let's see:

Step3: in room3, step4: goto red_ball_1, step5: pick. Then step6: go back to room4 via green_door_1.

Now, when we return to room4, we are holding red_ball_1. Then step7: gotodoor grey_door_1 room4 room2. Then toggle grey_door_1 (step8). Now, after unlocking grey_door_1, constraint5 requires that earlier we were in room3 or held red_ball_2. But we were in room3 (steps3-6) and holding red_ball_1 (step5). So since we were in room3, that satisfies the constraint5.

Then step9: gotoroom room4 room2 grey_door_1. Now in room2. Then, need to pick up yellow_box_1 (step10-11), then go to grey_door_1 (step12), then proceed to unlock yellow_door_1, etc.

But while holding red_ball_1, we can't pick up yellow_box_1. So we need to drop red_ball_1 somewhere. So after step9, in room2, we need to drop red_ball_1 before picking yellow_box_1.

So steps:

9. gotoroom room4 room2 grey_door_1 (now in room2, holding red_ball_1)
10. gotoempty room2
11. drop red_ball_1 room2
12. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room2
13. pick yellow_box_1 room2
14. gotodoor grey_door_1 room2 room4
15. ... (proceed as before)

This adds steps. But this might be necessary. So the total steps increase. Alternatively, after step5, drop red_ball_1 in room3, then proceed. That way, hands are free to pick yellow_box_1 later.

But this requires additional steps. For example:

5. pick red_ball_1 room3
6. gotoempty room3
7. drop red_ball_1 room3
8. gotoroom room3 room4 green_door_1
9. gotodoor grey_door_1 room4 room2
10. toggle grey_door_1
11. gotoroom room4 room2 grey_door_1
12. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room2
13. pick yellow_box_1 room2
14. gotodoor grey_door_1 room2 room4
15. ... etc.

But this also adds steps. So perhaps the initial plan is better. However, the initial plan may have a step where we are holding red_ball_1 when we need to pick up yellow_box_1, which isn't allowed. Because to pick up yellow_box_1, we must not be holding anything. So this is a problem.

Ah, yes! In step5, after picking red_ball_1, we can't pick yellow_box_1 in step12 unless we drop red_ball_1 first. So this is a flaw in the initial plan.

So the initial plan had steps:

After step5 (holding red_ball_1), go back to room4 (step6), unlock grey_door_1 (step7-9), then in room2 (step10), goto yellow_box_1 (step11), pick (step12). But at step12, we are still holding red_ball_1, so cannot pick yellow_box_1. Thus, the initial plan is invalid.

This is a critical error. So the plan needs to account for dropping red_ball_1 before picking up yellow_box_1.

So revised steps:

After step5 (pick red_ball_1), need to drop it somewhere. Let's drop it in room3.

Step5: pick red_ball_1 room3
Step6: gotoempty room3
Step7: drop red_ball_1 room3

Then proceed to room4:

Step8: gotoroom room3 room4 green_door_1
Step9: gotodoor grey_door_1 room4 room2
Step10: toggle grey_door_1
Step11: gotoroom room4 room2 grey_door_1
Step12: gotoobject yellow_box_1 room2
Step13: pick yellow_box_1 room2
Step14: gotodoor grey_door_1 room2 room4 (now in front of grey_door_1, satisfying constraint7)
Step15: gotodoor yellow_door_1 room2 room1
Step16: toggle yellow_door_1
Step17: gotoroom room2 room1 yellow_door_1
Step18: gotoobject blue_box_1 room1
Step19: gotoroom room1 room2 yellow_door_1
Step20: gotoobject red_box_1 room2

Now, this adds steps, but it's necessary. But this makes the plan longer. But it's required because you can't hold two objects.

Additionally, after dropping red_ball_1 in room3 (step7), we need to ensure that we have satisfied constraint6: being in room3 holding red_ball_1. Step5 and step6: we were holding it and then dropped it. So the state where you are in room3 holding red_ball_1 is step5. So constraint6 is satisfied.

Then, after that, proceed. Now, in room2, pick up yellow_box_1 (step13), then go to grey_door_1 (step14), satisfying constraint7 and8.

Then, unlock yellow_door_1, go to room1, be in front of blue_box_1 (step18), then return to room2 and goto red_box_1.

This plan now includes all necessary steps and addresses the error.

But now, step count is 20. Can we optimize further?

Alternative approach: After picking red_ball_1 (step5), carry it to room4, drop it there, then proceed.

But that would require:

Step5: pick red_ball_1 room3
Step6: gotoroom room3 room4 green_door_1 (still holding red_ball_1)
Step7: gotoempty room4
Step8: drop red_ball_1 room4

Then proceed to unlock grey_door_1. This way, after step8, red_ball_1 is in room4. Then unlock grey_door_1, go to room2, pick yellow_box_1, etc. This way, you drop red_ball_1 in room4 instead of room3. This may not affect other constraints, but we need to ensure that constraint6 is met (being in room3 holding red_ball_1). Which is satisfied in step5.

But this approach may save a step if possible. For example, after dropping in room4, you can proceed to unlock grey_door_1.

But this would require:

Steps:

5. pick red_ball_1 room3
6. gotoroom room3 room4 green_door_1
7. gotoempty room4
8. drop red_ball_1 room4
9. gotodoor grey_door_1 room4 room2
10. toggle grey_door_1
11. gotoroom room4 room2 grey_door_1
12. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room2
13. pick yellow_box_1 room2
14. gotodoor grey_door_1 room2 room4
15. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room2 room1
16. toggle yellow_door_1
17. gotoroom room2 room1 yellow_door_1
18. gotoobject blue_box_1 room1
19. gotoroom room1 room2 yellow_door_1
20. gotoobject red_box_1 room2

This is 20 steps as well. No difference in step count.

Another optimization: After step14 (in front of grey_door_1 in room2), instead of going to yellow_door_1, perhaps use another door. But no, to reach room1, yellow_door_1 is the only door connecting room1 and room2.

Thus, it seems the plan must be around 20 steps. But wait, let's count again with the revised steps:

1. gotodoor green_door_1 room4 room3
2. toggle green_door_1
3. gotoroom room4 room3 green_door_1
4. gotoobject red_ball_1 room3
5. pick red_ball_1 room3
6. gotoempty room3
7. drop red_ball_1 room3
8. gotoroom room3 room4 green_door_1
9. gotodoor grey_door_1 room4 room2
10. toggle grey_door_1
11. gotoroom room4 room2 grey_door_1
12. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room2
13. pick yellow_box_1 room2
14. gotodoor grey_door_1 room2 room4
15. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room2 room1
16. toggle yellow_door_1
17. gotoroom room2 room1 yellow_door_1
18. gotoobject blue_box_1 room1
19. gotoroom room1 room2 yellow_door_1
20. gotoobject red_box_1 room2

That's 20 steps. But maybe some steps can be merged. For example, after step7 (drop red_ball_1 in room3), we can directly go to room4 (step8). Then step9: gotodoor grey_door_1. But step9 requires being in room4. Yes. So steps are necessary.

Alternatively, after step3 (in room3), steps4-7 are: gotoobject, pick, gotoempty, drop. Then step8: go to room4. That's necessary.

Is there a way to avoid dropping red_ball_1? For example, can we use red_ball_2 instead for any constraints? Constraint6 requires holding red_ball_1, so we must pick that. Constraint5 requires that if grey_door_1 is unlocked, then earlier we were in room3 or held red_ball_2. So if we pick red_ball_2 instead of red_ball_1, then constraint5 is satisfied, and constraint6 would not be. So we need to pick red_ball_1 to satisfy constraint6.

Therefore, the plan must include picking red_ball_1.

Alternative Idea: After unlocking grey_door_1, can we go to room2, pick yellow_box_1, then go to grey_door_1, then proceed. But the problem is that after unlocking grey_door_1, we need to have been in room3 or held red_ball_2. If we pick red_ball_2 instead of red_ball_1, but constraint6 requires holding red_ball_1. So this isn't possible.

Thus, the plan must include the steps to pick red_ball_1 in room3, drop it, then proceed.

Another possible optimization: After step5 (pick red_ball_1), can we go directly to room4 and drop it there, saving a step? For example:

5. pick red_ball_1 room3
6. gotoroom room3 room4 green_door_1 (still holding it)
7. gotoempty room4
8. drop red_ball_1 room4

This skips the gotoempty in room3, thus saving a step. Let's count:

1. gotodoor green_door_1 room4 room3
2. toggle green_door_1
3. gotoroom room4 room3 green_door_1
4. gotoobject red_ball_1 room3
5. pick red_ball_1 room3
6. gotoroom room3 room4 green_door_1 (now in room4, holding red_ball_1)
7. gotoempty room4
8. drop red_ball_1 room4
9. gotodoor grey_door_1 room4 room2
10. toggle grey_door_1
11. gotoroom room4 room2 grey_door_1 (room2)
12. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room2
13. pick yellow_box_1 room2
14. gotodoor grey_door_1 room2 room4
15. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room2 room1
16. toggle yellow_door_1
17. gotoroom room2 room1 yellow_door_1
18. gotoobject blue_box_1 room1
19. gotoroom room1 room2 yellow_door_1
20. gotoobject red_box_1 room2

This is 20 steps as well. But step6 (gotoroom) requires that the door is unlocked. Since we toggled green_door_1 in step2, it's unlocked. So possible.

But this way, steps6-8 are in room4, dropping red_ball_1 there. This doesn't violate any constraints. But this saves a step compared to the previous version where we dropped in room3 (which required steps6-7). So this plan is 20 steps, but the previous was 20 as well. So no difference.

But perhaps step7 (gotoempty in room4) can be skipped by dropping in front of the door. But the 'drop' action requires that the position in front is empty. So after step6 (arrive in room4), we are in front of green_door_1. So if we drop there, but the position in front of the door is empty, then we can drop. Wait, after gotoroom, you are no longer in front of any object. So after step6, you are in room4, not in front of any object. So to drop, you need to be in front of an empty position. So you need to gotoempty, then drop. So steps6-8 are necessary.

Thus, no step reduction.

Another angle: After step13 (pick yellow_box_1), can we proceed directly to grey_door_1 in room2, then toggle grey_door_1 again? Not necessary, but perhaps to fulfill constraint2 (grey_door_1 is locked in some state). But initially, it's locked, so constraint2 is already satisfied.

But the plan must ensure that grey_door_1 is locked in some state. Initially, it's locked. So constraint2 is satisfied by the initial state. So no need to lock it again.

Thus, the plan remains as is.

Finally, the optimal plan would be the shortest possible that satisfies all constraints. Considering all the necessary steps, the plan outlined with 20 steps seems to be the minimal required. However, perhaps there's a way to shortcut some steps.

Wait, after step20, we are in front of red_box_1 in room2. So the goal is achieved. Let's verify all constraints again:

Constraint1: Held red_ball_1 and yellow_box_1. Satisfied.

Constraint2: grey_door_1 was locked initially.

Constraint3: When grey_door_1 was locked (initially), later green_door_1 was unlocked (step2).

Constraint4: grey_door_1 is unlocked in step10.

Constraint5: When grey_door_1 is unlocked (step10), earlier state was in room3 (steps3-6).

Constraint6: In room3 holding red_ball_1 (step5).

Constraint7: In front of grey_door_1 in step9 (room4) and step14 (room2).

Constraint8: In step14 (front of grey_door_1), earlier held yellow_box_1 (step13).

Constraint9: In front of blue_box_1 in step18.

Constraint10: In room4 initially (step0) and steps6-8.

Constraint11: In room4 (step0), later go to room1 (step17).

All constraints are satisfied.

But the plan has 20 steps. Maybe there's a way to reduce this.

Alternative Idea: After step3 (in room3), gotoobject red_ball_1, pick, then goto door green_door_1 in room3, then toggle it (but it's already unlocked). But green_door_1 was unlocked in step2. So toggling it would lock it again. But that might complicate things. So better to leave it unlocked.

Another Idea: After step10 (unlock grey_door_1), go to room2 and immediately goto red_box_1. But need to fulfill other constraints. For example, being in front of grey_door_1 (step9: gotodoor grey_door_1 in room4, then step10: toggle. So after step10, you're in front of grey_door_1 in room4. Then step11: gotoroom to room2. So arriving in room2, not in front of any object. So need to go to red_box_1. But also need to be in front of grey_door_1 in room2. So after arriving in room2, goto grey_door_1, then proceed.

But this adds steps. So perhaps:

11. gotoroom room4 room2 grey_door_1 (now in room2)
12. gotodoor grey_door_1 room2 room4 (front of grey_door_1)
13. pick yellow_box_1 requires being in front of it, so need to go there.

This complicates things. It's better to follow the earlier plan.

After multiple revisions, the plan must include all the necessary steps to meet the constraints. Therefore, the optimal plan is as outlined, with 20 steps. But perhaps I made a mistake in counting. Let me recount the steps in the latest version:

1. gotodoor green_door_1 room4 room3
2. toggle green_door_1
3. gotoroom room4 room3 green_door_1
4. gotoobject red_ball_1 room3
5. pick red_ball_1 room3
6. gotoroom room3 room4 green_door_1
7. gotoempty room4
8. drop red_ball_1 room4
9. gotodoor grey_door_1 room4 room2
10. toggle grey_door_1
11. gotoroom room4 room2 grey_door_1
12. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room2
13. pick yellow_box_1 room2
14. gotodoor grey_door_1 room2 room4
15. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room2 room1
16. toggle yellow_door_1
17. gotoroom room2 room1 yellow_door_1
18. gotoobject blue_box_1 room1
19. gotoroom room1 room2 yellow_door_1
20. gotoobject red_box_1 room2

Yes, 20 steps. However, perhaps some steps can be merged. For example, step7 (gotoempty room4) and step8 (drop) can be merged if possible. But according to the action definitions, 'drop' requires being in front of an empty position. So to drop, you must first gotoempty. Therefore, steps7 and8 are necessary.

Thus, the optimal plan is this 20-step sequence.
