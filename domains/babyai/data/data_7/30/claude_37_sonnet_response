Let's analyze this planning problem carefully:

1. We need to reach a state where there is a red box in room_2, I am in room_2, and in front of that red box. 
2. There's a red_box_1 that is in room_2 initially, so this should be the target.

Let's also understand the constraints:

1. I must hold some object at some point.
2. Grey_door_1 must be locked at some point (it is initially locked, so this is satisfied).
3. If grey_door_1 is locked, then at some point after that, either green_door_1 must be unlocked or I must be in front of yellow_door_1.
4. Grey_door_1 must be unlocked at some point.
5. If grey_door_1 is unlocked, then at some earlier point, I must either be in room_3 or holding red_ball_2.
6. I must be in room_3 and holding red_ball_1 at some point.
7. I must be in front of grey_door_1 at some point.
8. If I am in front of grey_door_1, then at some earlier point, I must be holding yellow_box_1.
9. I must be in front of blue_box_1 at some point.
10. I must be in room_4 at some point (I start in room_4, so this is satisfied).
11. If I am in room_4, then at some point after that, I must either be in room_1 or red_door_1 must be unlocked.

I start in room_4. There's a yellow_box_2 here. The doors grey_door_1 (to room_2) and green_door_1 (to room_3) are locked. I need to unlock them to move between rooms.

Let's think about how to satisfy the constraints: grey_door_1 starts locked, and if I want to unlock it, I need to either be in room_3 or holding red_ball_2 (which is in room_3) at some point. Also, I need to hold yellow_box_1 (in room_2) before being in front of grey_door_1. So, I need to first get to room_3 to get red_ball_2 or be in room_3, and then get to room_2 to get yellow_box_1.

The doors are all locked initially, so I need to toggle them to pass between rooms. To satisfy constraint 3, after grey_door_1 is locked, I need to either unlock green_door_1 or be in front of yellow_door_1. Since I'll need to move between room_4 and room_3 (to get red_ball_1, as per constraint 6), I'll probably unlock green_door_1.

Let's devise a plan:

1. Start in room_4.
2. Go to grey_door_1, which connects room_4 and room_2.
3. Toggle grey_door_1 to unlock it (this satisfies constraint 4). Note that I need to either be in room_3 or holding red_ball_2 before this (constraint 5).
4. Go to room_2.
5. Go to yellow_box_1 in room_2.
6. Pick up yellow_box_1 (this satisfies constraint 1, holding some object).
7. Go back to grey_door_1 (this satisfies constraint 7, being in front of grey_door_1, after having held yellow_box_1, satisfying constraint 8).
8. Drop yellow_box_1 (to free my hands).
9. Go to red_box_1 in room_2, which is the goal box.
10. This satisfies the goal: I am in room_2, in front of red_box_1, which is a red box.

But I'm missing a bunch of constraints. Let's reconsider.

I start in room_4. I need to be in room_3 or hold red_ball_2 before unlocking grey_door_1 (constraint 5). I need to be in room_3 and hold red_ball_1 at some point (constraint 6). I also need to be in front of blue_box_1, which is in room_1 (constraint 9).

Since green_door_1 connects room_4 and room_3, I'll first toggle it to go to room_3. Then, I'll pick up red_ball_1 (satisfying constraint 6). Then, I'll need to get to room_1 to be in front of blue_box_1 (constraint 9). For that, I'll toggle red_door_1, which connects room_3 and room_1. After that, I'll go to room_2 to get yellow_box_1, which I need to hold before being in front of grey_door_1 (constraint 8). Then, I'll unlock grey_door_1 to satisfy constraint 4.

Actually, this isn't right. Let's revise the plan.

I'm trying to piece together a coherent plan that satisfies all the constraints. Let's try again, considering the room layout and the sequence of moves.

Starting in room_4:
- The only way to reach other rooms is through grey_door_1 (to room_2) or green_door_1 (to room_3). Both are locked.
- Constraint 5 says that before unlocking grey_door_1, I must be in room_3 or holding red_ball_2.
- Constraint 11 says that after being in room_4, I must be in room_1 or red_door_1 must be unlocked.

So, I first need to unlock green_door_1 to go to room_3, fulfilling the prerequisite to unlocking grey_door_1. Then, I'll unlock red_door_1 to get to room_1, satisfying constraint 11.

Let's revise the plan:

1. Start in room_4.
2. Go to green_door_1 (connects room_4 and room_3).
3. Toggle green_door_1 to unlock it.
4. Go to room_3.
5. Go to red_ball_1 in room_3.
6. Pick up red_ball_1 (satisfying constraint 6, being in room_3 and holding red_ball_1, and constraint 1, holding some object).
7. Go to red_door_1 (connects room_3 and room_1).
8. Toggle red_door_1 to unlock it (satisfying part of constraint 11, unlocking red_door_1 after being in room_4).
9. Drop red_ball_1 (to free my hands).
10. Go to red_ball_2 in room_3.
11. Pick up red_ball_2 (this satisfies part of constraint 5, I'm holding red_ball_2 before unlocking grey_door_1).
12. Go to room_1 via red_door_1 (satisfying the rest of constraint 11, being in room_1 after being in room_4).
13. Go to blue_box_1 in room_1 (satisfying constraint 9, being in front of blue_box_1).
14. Drop red_ball_2 (to free my hands).
15. Go to yellow_door_1 (connects room_1 and room_2).
16. Toggle yellow_door_1 to unlock it.
17. Go to room_2 via yellow_door_1.
18. Go to yellow_box_1 in room_2.
19. Pick up yellow_box_1 (satisfying constraint 8 in preparation for being in front of grey_door_1).
20. Go to grey_door_1 (connects room_2 and room_4).
21. I'm now in front of grey_door_1 (satisfying constraint 7) after having held yellow_box_1 (satisfying constraint 8).
22. Toggle grey_door_1 to unlock it (satisfying constraint 4).
23. Drop yellow_box_1 (to free my hands).
24. Go to red_box_1 in room_2 (satisfying the goal, I am in room_2, in front of red_box_1, which is a red box).

But I'm noticing that I'm missing constraint 3: "If grey_door_1 is locked (which it is initially), then at some point after that, either green_door_1 is unlocked or I am in front of yellow_door_1."

I'll be unlocking green_door_1 (step 3), so that part of constraint 3 will be satisfied.

Let me double-check the constraints:

1. I must hold some object at some point. Satisfied by holding red_ball_1, red_ball_2, and yellow_box_1.
2. Grey_door_1 must be locked at some point. Satisfied initially.
3. If grey_door_1 is locked, then at some point after that, either green_door_1 must be unlocked or I must be in front of yellow_door_1. Satisfied by unlocking green_door_1 in step 3 and also by being in front of yellow_door_1 in step 15.
4. Grey_door_1 must be unlocked at some point. Satisfied in step 22.
5. If grey_door_1 is unlocked, then at some earlier point, I must either be in room_3 or holding red_ball_2. Satisfied by being in room_3 in steps 4-11 and holding red_ball_2 in steps 11-14.
6. I must be in room_3 and holding red_ball_1 at some point. Satisfied in step 6.
7. I must be in front of grey_door_1 at some point. Satisfied in step 21.
8. If I am in front of grey_door_1, then at some earlier point, I must be holding yellow_box_1. Satisfied by holding yellow_box_1 in steps 19-23 before being in front of grey_door_1 in step 21.
9. I must be in front of blue_box_1 at some point. Satisfied in step 13.
10. I must be in room_4 at some point. Satisfied initially.
11. If I am in room_4, then at some point after that, I must either be in room_1 or red_door_1 must be unlocked. Satisfied by unlocking red_door_1 in step 8 and being in room_1 in step 12.

The plan seems to satisfy all constraints, but I realized it might not be optimal. Let's try to optimize the plan a bit. I'll reconsider the room layout and the sequence of moves.

I'm starting in room_4. I need to reach room_2 and be in front of red_box_1. To reach room_2 from room_4, I need to unlock grey_door_1. Before unlocking grey_door_1, I need to be in room_3 or holding red_ball_2 (from constraint 5). Also, before being in front of grey_door_1, I need to hold yellow_box_1 (from constraint 8).

Let's optimize the plan:

1. Start in room_4.
2. Go to green_door_1.
3. Toggle green_door_1 to unlock it.
4. Go to room_3 via green_door_1.
5. Go to red_ball_1.
6. Pick up red_ball_1.
7. Go back to green_door_1.
8. Go to room_4 via green_door_1.
9. Go to grey_door_1.
10. Toggle grey_door_1 to unlock it. (This is valid because I've been in room_3, satisfying constraint 5).
11. Go to room_2 via grey_door_1.
12. Go to yellow_box_1.
13. Drop red_ball_1 (to free my hands).
14. Pick up yellow_box_1.
15. Go to grey_door_1 (satisfying constraint 7, being in front of grey_door_1, after having held yellow_box_1, satisfying constraint 8).
16. Toggle grey_door_1 to lock it (this ensures constraint 2, grey_door_1 is locked).
17. If we're following constraint 3, after grey_door_1 is locked, we need to either unlock green_door_1 or be in front of yellow_door_1. Green_door_1 is already unlocked from step 3.
18. Go to red_box_1 in room_2 (satisfying the goal, I am in room_2, in front of red_box_1, which is a red box).

Wait, let me trace this again. This plan is missing constraint 9 (being in front of blue_box_1) and constraint 11 (being in room_1 or unlocking red_door_1 after being in room_4).

Actually, let's go back to the original plan. It satisfies all constraints and it gets from the start to the goal state. It may not be the most optimal, but it ensures we hit all the required checkpoints.

Double checking the plan:

1. Start in room_4.
2. Go to green_door_1 (connects room_4 and room_3).
3. Toggle green_door_1 to unlock it (satisfying part of constraint 3, unlocking green_door_1 after grey_door_1 is locked).
4. Goto room_3 via green_door_1.
5. Go to red_ball_1 in room_3.
6. Pick up red_ball_1 (satisfying constraint 6, being in room_3 and holding red_ball_1, and constraint 1, holding some object).
7. Go to red_door_1 (connects room_3 and room_1).
8. Toggle red_door_1 to unlock it (satisfying part of constraint 11, unlocking red_door_1 after being in room_4).
9. Go to room_1 via red_door_1 (satisfying the rest of constraint 11, being in room_1 after being in room_4).
10. Go to blue_box_1 in room_1 (satisfying constraint 9, being in front of blue_box_1).
11. Drop red_ball_1 (to free my hands).
12. Go to yellow_door_1 (connects room_1 and room_2).
13. Toggle yellow_door_1 to unlock it.
14. Go to room_2 via yellow_door_1.
15. Go to yellow_box_1 in room_2.
16. Pick up yellow_box_1.
17. Go to grey_door_1 (connects room_2 and room_4).
18. I'm now in front of grey_door_1 (satisfying constraint 7) after having held yellow_box_1 (satisfying constraint 8).
19. Toggle grey_door_1 to unlock it (satisfying constraint 4).
20. Toggle grey_door_1 again to lock it (ensuring constraint 2, grey_door_1 is locked). Since I've already unlocked green_door_1 in step 3, constraint 3 is satisfied.
21. Drop yellow_box_1 (to free my hands).
22. Go to red_box_1 in room_2 (satisfying the goal, I am in room_2, in front of red_box_1, which is a red box).

Hmm, wait. If the goal is to be in front of red_box_1, which is already in room_2, do I really need to unlock grey_door_1? Let's reconsider the plan in the context of the goal.

I start in room_4 and I need to end up in room_2, in front of red_box_1. To get to room_2 from room_4, I can:
1. Go through grey_door_1 directly, but it's locked. Before unlocking it, I need to either be in room_3 or holding red_ball_2 (from constraint 5).
2. Go to room_3 via green_door_1, then to room_1 via red_door_1, then to room_2 via yellow_door_1. All these doors are locked initially.

Let's choose the second route, as it allows me to hit all the constraint checkpoints without revisiting rooms.

Let's refine the plan once more:

1. Start in room_4.
2. Go to green_door_1 (connects room_4 and room_3).
3. Toggle green_door_1 to unlock it (satisfying part of constraint 3, unlocking green_door_1 after grey_door_1 is locked).
4. Go to room_3 via green_door_1 (this fulfills part of constraint 5, I've been in room_3 before unlocking grey_door_1).
5. Go to red_ball_1 in room_3.
6. Pick up red_ball_1 (satisfying constraint 6, being in room_3 and holding red_ball_1, and constraint 1, holding some object).
7. Go to red_door_1 (connects room_3 and room_1).
8. Toggle red_door_1 to unlock it (satisfying part of constraint 11, unlocking red_door_1 after being in room_4).
9. Go to room_1 via red_door_1 (satisfying the rest of constraint 11, being in room_1 after being in room_4).
10. Go to blue_box_1 in room_1 (satisfying constraint 9, being in front of blue_box_1).
11. Drop red_ball_1 (to free my hands).
12. Go to yellow_door_1 (connects room_1 and room_2).
13. Toggle yellow_door_1 to unlock it.
14. Go to room_2 via yellow_door_1.
15. Go to yellow_box_1 in room_2.
16. Pick up yellow_box_1.
17. Go to red_box_1 in room_2 (satisfying the goal, I am in room_2, in front of red_box_1, which is a red box).

Hmm, this plan misses constraints 7 and 8. I need to be in front of grey_door_1 at some point, and before that, I need to hold yellow_box_1. So, I'll need to go back to room_4 via grey_door_1.

Let's try once more, making sure I satisfy all constraints:

1. Start in room_4.
2. Go to green_door_1 (connects room_4 and room_3).
3. Toggle green_door_1 to unlock it (satisfying part of constraint 3, unlocking green_door_1 after grey_door_1 is locked).
4. Go to room_3 via green_door_1 (this fulfills part of constraint 5, I've been in room_3 before unlocking grey_door_1).
5. Go to red_ball_1 in room_3.
6. Pick up red_ball_1 (satisfying constraint 6, being in room_3 and holding red_ball_1, and constraint 1, holding some object).
7. Go to red_door_1 (connects room_3 and room_1).
8. Toggle red_door_1 to unlock it (satisfying part of constraint 11, unlocking red_door_1 after being in room_4).
9. Go to room_1 via red_door_1 (satisfying the rest of constraint 11, being in room_1 after being in room_4).
10. Go to blue_box_1 in room_1 (satisfying constraint 9, being in front of blue_box_1).
11. Drop red_ball_1 (to free my hands).
12. Go to yellow_door_1 (connects room_1 and room_2).
13. Toggle yellow_door_1 to unlock it (satisfying part of constraint 3, being in front of yellow_door_1 after grey_door_1 is locked).
14. Go to room_2 via yellow_door_1.
15. Go to yellow_box_1 in room_2.
16. Pick up yellow_box_1.
17. Go to grey_door_1 (connects room_2 and room_4).
18. I'm now in front of grey_door_1 (satisfying constraint 7) after having held yellow_box_1 (satisfying constraint 8).
19. Toggle grey_door_1 to unlock it (satisfying constraint 4).
20. Drop yellow_box_1 (to free my hands).
21. Go to red_box_1 in room_2 (satisfying the goal, I am in room_2, in front of red_box_1, which is a red box).

Hmm, I don't think I need to go back to room_4. I can just end the plan in room_2.

Let's try once more, making sure I satisfy all constraints and keep the plan optimal:

1. Start in room_4.
2. Go to green_door_1 (connects room_4 and room_3).
3. Toggle green_door_1 to unlock it (satisfying part of constraint 3, unlocking green_door_1 after grey_door_1 is locked).
4. Go to room_3 via green_door_1 (this fulfills part of constraint 5, I've been in room_3 before unlocking grey_door_1).
5. Go to red_ball_1 in room_3.
6. Pick up red_ball_1 (satisfying constraint 6, being in room_3 and holding red_ball_1, and constraint 1, holding some object).
7. Go to red_door_1 (connects room_3 and room_1).
8. Toggle red_door_1 to unlock it (satisfying part of constraint 11, unlocking red_door_1 after being in room_4).
9. Go to room_1 via red_door_1 (satisfying the rest of constraint 11, being in room_1 after being in room_4).
10. Go to blue_box_1 in room_1 (satisfying constraint 9, being in front of blue_box_1).
11. Drop red_ball_1 (to free my hands).
12. Go to yellow_door_1 (connects room_1 and room_2).
13. Toggle yellow_door_1 to unlock it (satisfying part of constraint 3, being in front of yellow_door_1 after grey_door_1 is locked).
14. Go to room_2 via yellow_door_1.
15. Go to yellow_box_1 in room_2.
16. Pick up yellow_box_1.
17. Go to grey_door_1 (connects room_2 and room_4).
18. I'm now in front of grey_door_1 (satisfying constraint 7) after having held yellow_box_1 (satisfying constraint 8).
19. Toggle grey_door_1 to unlock it (satisfying constraint 4).
20. Drop yellow_box_1 (to free my hands).
21. Go to red_box_1 in room_2 (satisfying the goal, I am in room_2, in front of red_box_1, which is a red box).

This plan satisfies all constraints and gets from the start to the goal state.

I realized that I didn't verify constraint 3 correctly. Constraint 3 states: "If expression 'grey_door_1 is locked' holds in some state s, then expression 'At least one of the following conditions is true: "green_door_1 is not locked", "you are in front of yellow_door_1"' must hold at s or at some state after s."

Grey_door_1 is locked initially, and I'm unlocking green_door_1 in step 3 and going in front of yellow_door_1 in step 12. So both conditions of the consequent of constraint 3 are satisfied after the antecedent is satisfied. So, constraint 3 is correctly fulfilled.

Let's double-check the other constraints:

1. I must hold some object at some point. Satisfied by holding red_ball_1 in steps 6-11 and yellow_box_1 in steps 16-20.
2. Grey_door_1 must be locked at some point. Satisfied initially.
3. If grey_door_1 is locked, then at some point after that, either green_door_1 must be unlocked or I must be in front of yellow_door_1. Satisfied by unlocking green_door_1 in step 3 and being in front of yellow_door_1 in step 12.
4. Grey_door_1 must be unlocked at some point. Satisfied in step 19.
5. If grey_door_1 is unlocked, then at some earlier point, I must either be in room_3 or holding red_ball_2. Satisfied by being in room_3 in steps 4-8.
6. I must be in room_3 and holding red_ball_1 at some point. Satisfied in steps 5-7.
7. I must be in front of grey_door_1 at some point. Satisfied in step 18.
8. If I am in front of grey_door_1, then at some earlier point, I must be holding yellow_box_1. Satisfied by holding yellow_box_1 in steps 16-20 before being in front of grey_door_1 in step 18.
9. I must be in front of blue_box_1 at some point. Satisfied in step 10.
10. I must be in room_4 at some point. Satisfied initially.
11. If I am in room_4, then at some point after that, I must either be in room_1 or red_door_1 must be unlocked. Satisfied by unlocking red_door_1 in step 8 and being in room_1 in step 9.

All constraints are satisfied by this plan.

Actually, just to be sure, let me convert my high-level plan to the specific actions required by the problem, to ensure that I'm not missing any details:

- gotoobject green_door_1 room_4
- toggle green_door_1
- gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1
- gotoobject red_ball_1 room_3
- pick red_ball_1 room_3
- gotoobject red_door_1 room_3
- toggle red_door_1
- gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1
- gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1
- gotoempty
- drop red_ball_1 room_1
- gotoobject yellow_door_1 room_1
- toggle yellow_door_1
- gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1
- gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_2
- pick yellow_box_1 room_2
- gotoobject grey_door_1 room_2
- toggle grey_door_1
- gotoempty
- drop yellow_box_1 room_2
- gotoobject red_box_1 room_2

This seems right to me. Let's review the constraints again to make sure:

1. I'm holding objects in steps 5 and 16.
2. Grey_door_1 is locked initially.
3. After grey_door_1 is locked, I unlock green_door_1 in step 2 and go in front of yellow_door_1 in step 12.
4. I unlock grey_door_1 in step 18.
5. Before unlocking grey_door_1, I've been in room_3 in steps 3-7.
6. I'm in room_3 and holding red_ball_1 in steps 5-6.
7. I'm in front of grey_door_1 in step 17.
8. Before being in front of grey_door_1, I'm holding yellow_box_1 in step 16.
9. I'm in front of blue_box_1 in step 9.
10. I'm in room_4 initially.
11. After being in room_4, I unlock red_door_1 in step 7 and go to room_1 in step 8.

All constraints are satisfied, and the goal is achieved: I'm in room_2, in front of red_box_1, which is a red box.

Wait, I just caught a potential issue. When I drop an object, I need to be in front of an empty position. I should go to an empty position first, and then drop the object. Let's fix that:

- gotoobject green_door_1 room_4
- toggle green_door_1
- gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1
- gotoobject red_ball_1 room_3
- pick red_ball_1 room_3
- gotoobject red_door_1 room_3
- toggle red_door_1
- gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1
- gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1
- gotoempty
- drop red_ball_1 room_1
- gotoobject yellow_door_1 room_1
- toggle yellow_door_1
- gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1
- gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_2
- pick yellow_box_1 room_2
- gotoobject grey_door_1 room_2
- toggle grey_door_1
- gotoempty
- drop yellow_box_1 room_2
- gotoobject red_box_1 room_2

Great, looks like everything is as expected.

One more thing to note, after I pick up an object, I'm no longer in front of it. So, I need to make sure that when I say I "go to" an object after picking it up, I'm actually going to a different position.

Hmm, I just realized I might need to be more specific about the exact sequence of actions, especially with respect to being in front of objects and dropping them. Let me clarify:

1. When I pick up an object, I'm no longer in front of it (the object is in my hands).
2. When I want to drop an object, I need to be in front of an empty position.
3. After dropping an object, I'm in front of that object.

With this in mind, let's fix the exact sequence of actions:

- gotoobject green_door_1 room_4
- toggle green_door_1
- gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1
- gotoobject red_ball_1 room_3
- pick red_ball_1 room_3
- gotoobject red_door_1 room_3
- toggle red_door_1
- gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1
- gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1
- gotoempty
- drop red_ball_1 room_1
- gotoobject yellow_door_1 room_1
- toggle yellow_door_1
- gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1
- gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_2
- pick yellow_box_1 room_2
- gotoobject grey_door_1 room_2
- toggle grey_door_1
- gotoempty
- drop yellow_box_1 room_2
- gotoobject red_box_1 room_2

This should work correctly. After verifying the constraints once more, this plan seems to be the most optimal solution for the given problem.

Here's a clearer trace through the constraints:

1. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'you are holding some object'": I am holding red_ball_1 after picking it up in step 5, and yellow_box_1 after picking it up in step 16.

2. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'grey_door_1 is locked'": Grey_door_1 is locked initially.

3. "If expression 'grey_door_1 is locked' holds in some state s, then expression 'At least one of the following conditions is true: "green_door_1 is not locked", "you are in front of yellow_door_1"' must hold at s or at some state after s": Grey_door_1 is locked initially. I unlock green_door_1 in step 2 and go in front of yellow_door_1 in step 12.

4. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'grey_door_1 is not locked'": I unlock grey_door_1 in step 18.

5. "If expression 'grey_door_1 is not locked' holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: 'At least one of the following conditions is true: "you are in room_3", "you are holding red_ball_2"'": Before unlocking grey_door_1 in step 18, I've been in room_3 in steps 3-7.

6. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'The following conditions are all true: "you are in room_3", "you are holding red_ball_1"'": I am in room_3 and holding red_ball_1 in steps 5-6.

7. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'you are in front of grey_door_1'": I am in front of grey_door_1 in step 17.

8. "If expression 'you are in front of grey_door_1' holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: 'you are holding yellow_box_1'": Before being in front of grey_door_1 in step 17, I am holding yellow_box_1 in step 16.

9. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'you are in front of blue_box_1'": I am in front of blue_box_1 in step 9.

10. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'you are in room_4'": I am in room_4 initially.

11. "If expression 'you are in room_4' holds in some state s, then expression 'At least one of the following conditions is true: "you are in room_1", "red_door_1 is not locked"' must hold at s or at some state after s": After being in room_4 initially, I unlock red_door_1 in step 7 and go to room_1 in step 8.

All constraints are satisfied, and the goal is achieved: I am in room_2, in front of red_box_1, which is a red box.

Wait, let me double-check that the "gotoempty" action before dropping an object is specified consistently with the problem's definition.

This is the description of the "drop" action's preconditions:
"You may only drop an object x if (i) you are currently holding x, and (ii) the position in front of you is empty."

So, before dropping an object, I need to be in front of an empty position. I've added a "gotoempty" action before each drop in the plan, so this should be fine.

And I think that my interpretation of the problem was correct: the goal is to be in room_2, in front of a red box (which would be red_box_1). So the exact sequence of actions I've provided should achieve this.

Hmm, actually let me think carefully about this again. For constraint 3: "If expression 'grey_door_1 is locked' holds in some state s, then expression 'At least one of the following conditions is true: "green_door_1 is not locked", "you are in front of yellow_door_1"' must hold at s or at some state after s"". Grey_door_1 is locked initially, and remains locked until step 18. At no point during these initial states is the condition "green_door_1 is not locked" true because green_door_1 is locked until step 2. So during the initial state, neither of the conditions required by the consequent of constraint 3 is true. However, at step 2, green_door_1 becomes unlocked, which satisfies the consequent. Since this happens after the initial state (where the antecedent holds), constraint 3 is satisfied.

Another quick recheck: In constraint 5: "If expression 'grey_door_1 is not locked' holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: 'At least one of the following conditions is true: "you are in room_3", "you are holding red_ball_2"'", grey_door_1 becomes unlocked in step 18. Before this, I've been in room_3 in steps 3-7, which satisfies the condition.

I believe this plan is correct and satisfies all the constraints.

Let's do a final trace through the plan to ensure the goal is achieved:

1. Start in room_4.
2. Go to green_door_1 in room_4.
3. Toggle green_door_1 to unlock it.
4. Go to room_3 via green_door_1.
5. Go to red_ball_1 in room_3.
6. Pick up red_ball_1.
7. Go to red_door_1 in room_3.
8. Toggle red_door_1 to unlock it.
9. Go to room_1 via red_door_1.
10. Go to blue_box_1 in room_1.
11. Go to an empty position.
12. Drop red_ball_1.
13. Go to yellow_door_1 in room_1.
14. Toggle yellow_door_1 to unlock it.
15. Go to room_2 via yellow_door_1.
16. Go to yellow_box_1 in room_2.
17. Pick up yellow_box_1.
18. Go to grey_door_1 in room_2.
19. Toggle grey_door_1 to unlock it.
20. Go to an empty position.
21. Drop yellow_box_1.
22. Go to red_box_1 in room_2.

At the end of this plan, I'm in room_2, in front of red_box_1, which is a red box. This achieves the goal.

I believe this plan is correct and optimal. Let me present it in the format that the problem asks for:

```
gotoobject green_door_1 room_4
toggle green_door_1
gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1
gotoobject red_ball_1 room_3
pick red_ball_1 room_3
gotoobject red_door_1 room_3
toggle red_door_1
gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1
gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1
gotoempty
drop red_ball_1 room_1
gotoobject yellow_door_1 room_1
toggle yellow_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1
gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_2
pick yellow_box_1 room_2
gotoobject grey_door_1 room_2
toggle grey_door_1
gotoempty
drop yellow_box_1 room_2
gotoobject red_box_1 room_2
```
