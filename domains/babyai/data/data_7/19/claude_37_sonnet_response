Let's break down the problem:

1. **Initial State**:
   - You are in room_1
   - blue_ball_1 is in room_1
   - purple_box_1 is in room_2
   - green_ball_1, green_ball_2, grey_ball_1, blue_ball_2 are in room_3
   - red_ball_1, yellow_ball_1 are in room_4
   - All doors (purple_door_1, red_door_1, purple_door_2, yellow_door_1) are locked
   - Room connections: room_1-room_2 via purple_door_1, room_1-room_3 via red_door_1, room_2-room_4 via purple_door_2, room_3-room_4 via yellow_door_1

2. **Goal**:
   - You are in room_4
   - red_ball_1 is in room_4
   - You are in front of red_ball_1

3. **Constraints**:
   - At some point, red_door_1 must be unlocked
   - You must never be in room_2
   - At some point, you must be in front of purple_door_2
   - If you are in front of purple_door_2, then afterward you must either be in room_3 or holding some object
   - At some point, yellow_door_1 must be unlocked
   - At some point, you must be holding some object and red_door_1 must be unlocked
   - purple_door_2 must always be locked
   - At some point, blue_ball_2 must be in room_1

Considering these constraints, let's plan a sequence of actions:

First, let's think about the path from room_1 to room_4. We can't use room_2 because of a constraint, so we need to go from room_1 to room_3 to room_4. For this, we need to unlock red_door_1 and yellow_door_1.

Let's also think about the constraint that blue_ball_2 must be in room_1. Initially, it's in room_3. So we need to go to room_3, pick up blue_ball_2, and bring it to room_1.

Let's trace a plan step by step:

1. **From room_1 to room_3**: We need to unlock red_door_1 first. We go to the door, toggle it, then enter room_3.
2. **In room_3, pick up blue_ball_2**.
3. **Return to room_1 and drop blue_ball_2**.
4. **Go back to room_3**.
5. **From room_3 to room_4**: We need to unlock yellow_door_1. We go to the door, toggle it, then enter room_4.
6. **In room_4, we go to red_ball_1**.

Let's also ensure that we satisfy the constraint about being in front of purple_door_2. We need to be in room_2 or room_4. We can't be in room_2 (due to another constraint), so we need to be in room_4 and in front of purple_door_2. After that, we need to either be in room_3 or holding an object. We can pick up an object like red_ball_1.

But wait, there's a problem. We can't go to room_2 because of a constraint, so how do we get in front of purple_door_2? purple_door_2 connects room_2 and room_4.

Hmm, after re-reading, I see I misunderstood. The constraint doesn't say we can't go to purple_door_2, but rather if we go to purple_door_2, then afterward we need to either be in room_3 or holding an object. So after we're in front of purple_door_2, let's pick up red_ball_1 to satisfy this.

Let's refine the plan:

1. **From room_1 to room_3**: We need to unlock red_door_1 first. We go to the door, toggle it, then enter room_3.
2. **In room_3, pick up blue_ball_2**.
3. **Return to room_1 and drop blue_ball_2**.
4. **Go back to room_3 and pick up some object**.
5. **From room_3 to room_4**: We need to unlock yellow_door_1. While holding the object, we go to the door, toggle it, then enter room_4.
6. **In room_4, go to purple_door_2**. After that, pick up red_ball_1.
7. **Go in front of red_ball_1**.

Now, let's refine the plan based on the constraints:

1. "At some point, red_door_1 must be unlocked" - This is in step 1.
2. "You must never be in room_2" - We never go to room_2 in the plan.
3. "At some point, you must be in front of purple_door_2" - This is in step 6.
4. "If you are in front of purple_door_2, then afterward you must either be in room_3 or holding some object" - After step 6, we pick up red_ball_1, so we'll be holding an object.
5. "At some point, yellow_door_1 must be unlocked" - This is in step 5.
6. "At some point, you must be holding some object and red_door_1 must be unlocked" - This is a bit tricky, but we can adjust. We go to red_door_1, pick up blue_ball_1 in room_1, go to red_door_1 again, toggle it, then drop blue_ball_1 and continue.
7. "purple_door_2 must always be locked" - We never unlock purple_door_2.
8. "At some point, blue_ball_2 must be in room_1" - This is in step 3.

It's actually not clear if constraint 6 means that the ball is picked up AND the door is unlocked at the same time, or if they happen separately. Let me plan for the case where they are required to happen simultaneously.

Let's adjust the plan based on the constraints:

1. **From room_1, pick up blue_ball_1**.
2. **Go to red_door_1 and toggle it**. This satisfies the constraint that we are holding some object and red_door_1 is unlocked.
3. **Enter room_3**.
4. **Drop blue_ball_1 in room_3**.
5. **Pick up blue_ball_2 in room_3**.
6. **Return to room_1 using the now-unlocked red_door_1**.
7. **Drop blue_ball_2 in room_1**. This satisfies the constraint that blue_ball_2 is in room_1.
8. **Return to room_3**.
9. **Go to yellow_door_1 and toggle it**. This satisfies the constraint that yellow_door_1 is unlocked.
10. **Enter room_4**.
11. **Go to purple_door_2**. This satisfies the constraint that you are in front of purple_door_2.
12. **Pick up an object, like red_ball_1**. This satisfies the constraint that after being in front of purple_door_2, you are either in room_3 or holding an object.
13. **Go in front of red_ball_1 (if not already)**.

However there's a contradiction: steps 11-13 aren't viable because you can't be in front of purple_door_2 and then be in front of red_ball_1 at the same time without going to another room or dropping the object, but the constraint says after being in front of purple_door_2, you need to be in room_3 or holding an object.

Let's look at the constraints again:
4. "If expression 'you are in front of purple_door_2' holds in some state s, then expression 'At least one of the following conditions is true: "you are in room_3", "you are holding some object"' must hold at s or at some state after s"

Actually, this means that after we are in front of purple_door_2, we need to either be in room_3 or holding an object in that state or any state after it. The most straightforward solution would be to pick up red_ball_1 at some point after being in front of purple_door_2.

Let's refine the plan one more time:

1. **From room_1, pick up blue_ball_1**.
2. **Go to red_door_1 and toggle it**. This satisfies the constraint that we are holding some object and red_door_1 is unlocked.
3. **Enter room_3**.
4. **Drop blue_ball_1 in room_3**.
5. **Pick up blue_ball_2 in room_3**.
6. **Return to room_1 using the now-unlocked red_door_1**.
7. **Drop blue_ball_2 in room_1**. This satisfies the constraint that blue_ball_2 is in room_1.
8. **Return to room_3**.
9. **Go to yellow_door_1 and toggle it**. This satisfies the constraint that yellow_door_1 is unlocked.
10. **Enter room_4**.
11. **Go to purple_door_2**. This satisfies the constraint that you are in front of purple_door_2.
12. **Go to an empty position**. This is just to change our position.
13. **Go to red_ball_1**.
14. **Pick up red_ball_1**. This satisfies the constraint that after being in front of purple_door_2, you are either in room_3 or holding an object. This also works because we are still in room_4 and we're now holding red_ball_1.
15. **Drop red_ball_1** (we pick it up just to satisfy the constraint). This satisfies the constraint that you are in front of red_ball_1.

Actually wait, I think I'm overthinking this. The condition says "If you are in front of purple_door_2, then afterward you must either be in room_3 or holding some object". We can be in front of purple_door_2, then go to red_ball_1, and then pick it up (which satisfies the condition). The final goal is to be in front of red_ball_1, not to be holding it.

So the plan is:

1. **From room_1, pick up blue_ball_1**.
2. **Go to red_door_1 and toggle it**. This satisfies the constraint that we are holding some object and red_door_1 is unlocked.
3. **Enter room_3**.
4. **Drop blue_ball_1 in room_3**.
5. **Pick up blue_ball_2 in room_3**.
6. **Return to room_1 using the now-unlocked red_door_1**.
7. **Drop blue_ball_2 in room_1**. This satisfies the constraint that blue_ball_2 is in room_1.
8. **Return to room_3**.
9. **Go to yellow_door_1 and toggle it**. This satisfies the constraint that yellow_door_1 is unlocked.
10. **Enter room_4**.
11. **Go to purple_door_2**. This satisfies the constraint that you are in front of purple_door_2.
12. **Pick up red_ball_1**. This satisfies the constraint that after being in front of purple_door_2, you are either in room_3 or holding an object.
13. **Drop red_ball_1**. This puts you in front of red_ball_1, satisfying the goal.

Wait, I think I'm overthinking the goal state. Let me just make sure: the goal is to be in room_4, have red_ball_1 in room_4, and to be in front of red_ball_1. So, we don't need to pick up and drop red_ball_1; we just need to be in front of it after all the previous steps.

Let's refine the plan one last time:

1. **From room_1, pick up blue_ball_1**.
2. **Go to red_door_1 and toggle it**. This satisfies the constraint that we are holding some object and red_door_1 is unlocked.
3. **Enter room_3**.
4. **Drop blue_ball_1 in room_3**.
5. **Pick up blue_ball_2 in room_3**.
6. **Return to room_1 using the now-unlocked red_door_1**.
7. **Drop blue_ball_2 in room_1**. This satisfies the constraint that blue_ball_2 is in room_1.
8. **Return to room_3**.
9. **Go to yellow_door_1 and toggle it**. This satisfies the constraint that yellow_door_1 is unlocked.
10. **Enter room_4**.
11. **Go to purple_door_2**. This satisfies the constraint that you are in front of purple_door_2.
12. **Pick up a ball in room_4 (not red_ball_1)**. This satisfies the constraint that after being in front of purple_door_2, you are either in room_3 or holding an object.
13. **Drop the ball**.
14. **Go to red_ball_1**. This satisfies the goal that you are in room_4, red_ball_1 is in room_4, and you are in front of red_ball_1.

Actually I don't even need to pick up and drop any other ball. I can just pick up red_ball_1 after step 11, which satisfies the constraint of "after being in front of purple_door_2, you are holding an object". Then I can drop it to satisfy the goal of "standing in front of red_ball_1".

Let's refine:

1. **From room_1, pick up blue_ball_1**.
2. **Go to red_door_1 and toggle it**. This satisfies the constraint that we are holding some object and red_door_1 is unlocked.
3. **Enter room_3**.
4. **Drop blue_ball_1 in room_3**.
5. **Pick up blue_ball_2 in room_3**.
6. **Return to room_1 using the now-unlocked red_door_1**.
7. **Drop blue_ball_2 in room_1**. This satisfies the constraint that blue_ball_2 is in room_1.
8. **Return to room_3**.
9. **Go to yellow_door_1 and toggle it**. This satisfies the constraint that yellow_door_1 is unlocked.
10. **Enter room_4**.
11. **Go to purple_door_2**. This satisfies the constraint that you are in front of purple_door_2.
12. **Go to red_ball_1**.
13. **Pick up red_ball_1**. This satisfies the constraint that after being in front of purple_door_2, you are either in room_3 or holding an object.
14. **Drop red_ball_1**. This puts you in front of red_ball_1, satisfying the goal.

But actually, I just re-read constraint 4 again, and it says: "If expression 'you are in front of purple_door_2' holds in some state s, then expression 'At least one of the following conditions is true: "you are in room_3", "you are holding some object"' must hold at s or at some state after s".

This doesn't mean that after being in front of purple_door_2, you must hold an object. It means that either at the state where you are in front of purple_door_2 OR after that state, you must either be in room_3 or holding an object. Going to room_3 is one of the options, so we can go to purple_door_2 and then to room_3.

So we if go to purple_door_2 and then go to red_ball_1 without picking up any object, we're violating this constraint, because we're neither in room_3 nor holding any object after being in front of purple_door_2.

Let's see if we can pick up an object while we're in room_4, go in front of purple_door_2, and then go to red_ball_1 without dropping the object. But wait, that wouldn't work for the goal, which is to be in front of red_ball_1. You can't be in front of two things at once.

Alright, so after being in front of purple_door_2, one of these 2 things must be true:
1. We are in room_3
2. We are holding an object.

So either we go from room_4 to room_3 after being in front of purple_door_2, or we pick up an object after being in front of purple_door_2.

Let's revise the plan slightly for option 2, picking up the object:

1. **From room_1, pick up blue_ball_1**.
2. **Go to red_door_1 and toggle it**. This satisfies the constraint that we are holding some object and red_door_1 is unlocked.
3. **Enter room_3**.
4. **Drop blue_ball_1 in room_3**.
5. **Pick up blue_ball_2 in room_3**.
6. **Return to room_1 using the now-unlocked red_door_1**.
7. **Drop blue_ball_2 in room_1**. This satisfies the constraint that blue_ball_2 is in room_1.
8. **Return to room_3**.
9. **Go to yellow_door_1 and toggle it**. This satisfies the constraint that yellow_door_1 is unlocked.
10. **Enter room_4**.
11. **Go to purple_door_2**. This satisfies the constraint that you are in front of purple_door_2.
12. **Go to yellow_ball_1**. 
13. **Pick up yellow_ball_1**. This satisfies the constraint that after being in front of purple_door_2, you are either in room_3 or holding an object.
14. **Drop yellow_ball_1**.
15. **Go to red_ball_1**. This satisfies the goal that you are in room_4, red_ball_1 is in room_4, and you are in front of red_ball_1.

Let's double-check all the constraints again:

1. "At some point, red_door_1 must be unlocked" - This is in step 2.
2. "You must never be in room_2" - We never go to room_2 in the plan.
3. "At some point, you must be in front of purple_door_2" - This is in step 11.
4. "If you are in front of purple_door_2, then afterward you must either be in room_3 or holding some object" - After step 11, we pick up yellow_ball_1 in step 13, so we'll be holding an object.
5. "At some point, yellow_door_1 must be unlocked" - This is in step 9.
6. "At some point, you must be holding some object and red_door_1 must be unlocked" - This is in step 2, where we're holding blue_ball_1 and we unlock red_door_1.
7. "purple_door_2 must always be locked" - We never unlock purple_door_2.
8. "At some point, blue_ball_2 must be in room_1" - This is in step 7.

So the revised plan seems to satisfy all constraints. However, let me consider if there's a more efficient way to satisfy the goal.

Actually, I think I can simplify this plan further. The goal is to be in room_4, have red_ball_1 in room_4, and to be in front of red_ball_1. Initially, red_ball_1 is already in room_4, so we just need to go to room_4 and be in front of red_ball_1.

We need to go from room_1 to room_4, and we can't go through room_2 due to a constraint. So, we need to go from room_1 to room_3 to room_4, which means unlocking red_door_1 and yellow_door_1.

We need to satisfy the constraint that at some point we are holding an object while red_door_1 is unlocked. We can pick up blue_ball_1 in room_1, go to red_door_1, toggle it, and then continue.

Okay, so here's a refined plan:

0. Note: we start in room_1 with the following objects:
   - blue_ball_1 in room_1
   - blue_ball_2 in room_3
   - red_ball_1 in room_4 (our goal is to be in front of this)
   - the states of other balls don't matter much

1. **Go to blue_ball_1 in room_1**.
2. **Pick up blue_ball_1**.
3. **Go to red_door_1**.
4. **Toggle red_door_1**. This satisfies the constraint that you are holding some object and red_door_1 is unlocked.
5. **Enter room_3**.
6. **Drop blue_ball_1** (it doesn't matter where we drop it, we just need to free up our hands to pick up blue_ball_2).
7. **Go to blue_ball_2 in room_3**.
8. **Pick up blue_ball_2**.
9. **Go to red_door_1**.
10. **Enter room_1 (using the already unlocked red_door_1)**.
11. **Drop blue_ball_2 in room_1**. This satisfies the constraint that blue_ball_2 is in room_1 at some point.
12. **Go to red_door_1**.
13. **Enter room_3**.
14. **Go to yellow_door_1**.
15. **Toggle yellow_door_1**. This satisfies the constraint that yellow_door_1 is unlocked at some point.
16. **Enter room_4**.
17. **Go to purple_door_2**. This satisfies the constraint that you are in front of purple_door_2 at some point.
18. **Go to yellow_ball_1 (or any other ball in room_4)**.
19. **Pick up yellow_ball_1**. This satisfies the constraint that after being in front of purple_door_2, you are either in room_3 or holding some object.
20. **Drop yellow_ball_1**.
21. **Go to red_ball_1**. This satisfies the goal that you are in room_4, red_ball_1 is in room_4, and you are in front of red_ball_1.

Let me check if there are unnecessary actions. The constraint requires that blue_ball_2 must be in room_1 at some point. It's initially in room_3. So, at some point, we need to pick up blue_ball_2 from room_3 and drop it in room_1.

Actually, let's see if the plan is correct with the correct action formats:

```
gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_1
pick blue_ball_1 room_1
gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3
toggle red_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1
gotoempty
drop blue_ball_1 room_3
gotoobject blue_ball_2 room_3
pick blue_ball_2 room_3
gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1
gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1
gotoempty
drop blue_ball_2 room_1
gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3
gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_4
toggle yellow_door_1
gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_1
gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_2
gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_4
pick yellow_ball_1 room_4
gotoempty
drop yellow_ball_1 room_4
gotoobject red_ball_1 room_4
```

I see some potential issues here. Let me go back to the action descriptions:

For "gotodoor", the preconditions is:
> "goto door": you may only go in front of a door d if (i) you are in a room which door d is connecting with another room, and (ii) there is no object blocking the position in front of d in the room you are currently in.

This works for all our door actions.

For "drop", the preconditions is:
> "drop": you may only drop an object x if (i) you are currently holding x, and (ii) the position in front of you is empty.

We need to first go to an empty position before dropping an object. Let me add those steps.

For "pick", the preconditions is:
> "pick": you may only pick up an object x if (i) you are in the same room as x, and (ii) you are currently not holding any object.

This works for all our pick actions.

Let's revise the plan with the correct format:

```
gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_1
pick blue_ball_1 room_1
gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3
toggle red_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1
gotoempty
drop blue_ball_1 room_3
gotoobject blue_ball_2 room_3
pick blue_ball_2 room_3
gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1
gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1
gotoempty
drop blue_ball_2 room_1
gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3
gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_4
toggle yellow_door_1
gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_1
gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_2
gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_4
pick yellow_ball_1 room_4
gotoempty
drop yellow_ball_1 room_4
gotoobject red_ball_1 room_4
```

Actually, I think the above revisions are correct. Let's review the plan one final time:

1. We go to blue_ball_1 in room_1 and pick it up.
2. We go to red_door_1, toggle it (which unlocks it), and enter room_3.
3. In room_3, we go to an empty space, drop blue_ball_1, pick up blue_ball_2, and return to room_1.
4. In room_1, we drop blue_ball_2 (which satisfies the constraint that blue_ball_2 is in room_1 at some point).
5. We go back to room_3, then to yellow_door_1, toggle it (which unlocks it), and enter room_4.
6. In room_4, we go to purple_door_2 (which satisfies the constraint that you are in front of purple_door_2 at some point), then to yellow_ball_1, pick it up, go to an empty space, and drop it. This ensures that after being in front of purple_door_2, you are holding an object (yellow_ball_1).
7. Finally, we go to red_ball_1, which satisfies the goal: we are in room_4, red_ball_1 is in room_4, and we are in front of red_ball_1.

This plan seems to satisfy all constraints and lead to the goal state.

Actually, let me review this with a clearer understanding of when we're in front of an object and when we have an object in hand:

Initially, you're not in front of any object.

We go to blue_ball_1 --> you're in front of blue_ball_1
You pick up blue_ball_1 --> you're no longer in front of blue_ball_1
We go to red_door_1 --> you're in front of red_door_1
You toggle red_door_1 --> (unchanged)
You enter room_3 --> you're no longer in front of red_door_1, you're not in front of anything
We go to an empty position --> unchanged
You drop blue_ball_1 --> you're now in front of blue_ball_1
We go to blue_ball_2 --> you're now in front of blue_ball_2
You pick up blue_ball_2 --> you're no longer in front of blue_ball_2
We go to red_door_1 --> you're in front of red_door_1
You enter room_1 --> you're no longer in front of red_door_1, you're not in front of anything
We go to an empty position --> unchanged
You drop blue_ball_2 --> you're now in front of blue_ball_2
...

Actually I notice an issue. It looks like each time we drop an object, we are automatically in front of it. However this doesn't matter, because the ball we want to be in front of, red_ball_1, is already in room_4. So we don't need to pick it up. We can just go to it at the end.

I think there's a problem with the ordering. I said we need to pick up yellow_ball_1 after being in front of purple_door_2. But if we do that, when we drop it we'll be in front of the yellow ball, not in front of red_ball_1. So we need to go to red_ball_1 last.

Let's revise the steps 21-24:
21. **Go to an empty position in room_4**.
22. **Go to purple_door_2**. This satisfies the constraint that you are in front of purple_door_2 at some point.
23. **Go to yellow_ball_1**.
24. **Pick up yellow_ball_1**. This satisfies the constraint that after being in front of purple_door_2, you are either in room_3 or holding an object.
25. **Go to an empty position**.
26. **Drop yellow_ball_1**.
27. **Go to red_ball_1**. This satisfies the goal.

Actually, I think the correct solution is to first go to purple_door_2 and then go to red_ball_1, pick it up. This satisfies the condition that after being in front of purple_door_2, we are holding an object. But then we need to drop red_ball_1, which mean we'll be in front of it, which is our goal.

Let's revise one more time for steps 18-21:
18. **Go to purple_door_2**. This satisfies the constraint that you are in front of purple_door_2 at some point.
19. **Go to red_ball_1**.
20. **Pick up red_ball_1**. This satisfies the constraint that after being in front of purple_door_2, you are either in room_3 or holding an object.
21. **Drop red_ball_1**.  Now you're in front of red_ball_1, satisfying the goal.

Wait, let's fix our understanding of the "drop" action. The effect of "drop" is:

"drop": After performing this action regarding an object x, (i) you are no longer carrying x, (ii) you are in front of x, (iii) your hands are empty, and (iv) object x is situated in the room you are currently in.

So yes, after dropping an object, we are in front of it.

Let's revise the full plan one more time:

```
gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_1
pick blue_ball_1 room_1
gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3
toggle red_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1
gotoempty
drop blue_ball_1 room_3
gotoobject blue_ball_2 room_3
pick blue_ball_2 room_3
gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1
gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1
gotoempty
drop blue_ball_2 room_1
gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3
gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_4
toggle yellow_door_1
gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_1
gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_2
gotoobject red_ball_1 room_4
pick red_ball_1 room_4
gotoempty
drop red_ball_1 room_4

Let's verify the constraints:

1. "At some point, red_door_1 must be unlocked" - This is in the "toggle red_door_1" action.
2. "You must never be in room_2" - We never enter room_2.
3. "At some point, you must be in front of purple_door_2" - We go to purple_door_2 in the "gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_2" action.
4. "If you are in front of purple_door_2, afterward you must either be in room_3 or holding some object" - After being in front of purple_door_2, we pick up red_ball_1, so we're holding an object.
5. "At some point, yellow_door_1 must be unlocked" - We toggle yellow_door_1 in the "toggle yellow_door_1" action.
6. "At some point, you must be holding some object and red_door_1 must be unlocked" - We are holding blue_ball_1 after we toggle red_door_1, so this is satisfied.
7. "purple_door_2 must always be locked" - We never toggle purple_door_2.
8. "At some point, blue_ball_2 must be in room_1" - We drop blue_ball_2 in room_1.

All constraints appear to be satisfied. The goal is to end up with "v is red" (red_ball_1 is red), "v is in room_4" (red_ball_1 is in room_4), "you are in room_4" (we are in room_4 at the end), "you are in front of v" (we are in front of red_ball_1 at the end). We also satisfy all of these.

So our final plan, with the correct action formats, is:

```
gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_1
pick blue_ball_1 room_1
gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3
toggle red_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1
gotoempty
drop blue_ball_1 room_3
gotoobject blue_ball_2 room_3
pick blue_ball_2 room_3
gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1
gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1
gotoempty
drop blue_ball_2 room_1
gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3
gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_4
toggle yellow_door_1
gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_1
gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_2
gotoobject red_ball_1 room_4
pick red_ball_1 room_4
gotoempty
drop red_ball_1 room_4
```

Ok, so our final valid plan is:

```
gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_1
pick blue_ball_1 room_1
gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3
toggle red_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1
gotoempty
drop blue_ball_1 room_3
gotoobject blue_ball_2 room_3
pick blue_ball_2 room_3
gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1
gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1
gotoempty
drop blue_ball_2 room_1
gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3
gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_4
toggle yellow_door_1
gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_1
gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_2
gotoobject red_ball_1 room_4
pick red_ball_1 room_4
gotoempty
drop red_ball_1 room_4
```
