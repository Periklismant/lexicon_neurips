Okay, let's tackle this planning problem step by step. First, I need to understand the initial state, the goal, and the constraints. The initial state says the agent is in room_1, and various objects are in different rooms. All doors are locked. The goal is to have a red ball in room_4, with the agent in room_4 and in front of that red ball. The constraints are a bit complex, so I'll need to make sure each is satisfied.

Starting with the goal: the red_ball_1 is already in room_4, so I just need to get to room_4 and be in front of it. But the agent is in room_1 initially. To move between rooms, the doors need to be unlocked. However, the constraints require that in at least one state, red_door_1 is unlocked, and similarly for yellow_door_1. Also, the agent can never be in room_2, so the path must avoid that. Additionally, purple_door_2 must always be locked, which connects room_2 and room_4. Since the agent can't go to room_2, that door is irrelevant except for the constraint that the agent must be in front of purple_door_2 at some point. But how? Because room_2 is off-limits. Wait, the constraint says "you are in front of purple_door_2" in some state. But purple_door_2 connects room_2 and room_4. To be in front of it, the agent must be in either room_2 or room_4. But since room_2 is forbidden, the agent can only be in room_4 and go to the door from there. But if the agent is in room_4, then they can go to purple_door_2, but that door is locked and must remain locked. So the agent can be in front of purple_door_2 in room_4. However, when they do that, the constraint requires that either they are in room_3 or holding an object at that state or after. So maybe after being in front of purple_door_2, they need to pick up something.

Another constraint is that blue_ball_2 must be in room_1 at some point. Initially, blue_ball_2 is in room_3. So the agent needs to move it to room_1. But how? The agent is starting in room_1. To get to room_3, they need to go through red_door_1, which is locked. So first, they need to unlock red_door_1. But the toggle action requires being in front of the door. So the steps might be: go to red_door_1 in room_1, unlock it, then go to room_3. Then pick up blue_ball_2, bring it back to room_1.

But the agent can't go to room_2, so the path from room_1 to room_3 is via red_door_1. Let's outline the steps:

1. From room_1, go to red_door_1 (which connects room_1 and room_3). Precondition: in room_1, and no object is blocking the door. Since initial state has blue_ball_1 in room_1. Is that blocking the door? The problem mentions that objects can block doors if they are in front. But initially, where are the objects? blue_ball_1 is in room_1, but the door's front position may be empty. So maybe possible to go to the door.

So action: gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3. Then toggle it to unlock. That satisfies the constraint that red_door_1 is not locked in at least one state.

Then, go to room_3 using gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1.

Once in room_3, need to pick up blue_ball_2. So gotoobject blue_ball_2 room_3, then pick it. Then go back to room_1, drop it there. That satisfies the blue_ball_2 in room_1 constraint.

But after that, the agent needs to get to room_4. The path from room_1 to room_4: possible via room_1 -> room_3 via red_door_1, then room_3 to room_4 via yellow_door_1. But yellow_door_1 is locked. So need to unlock it. So the agent must go to yellow_door_1 in room_3, unlock it. Then go to room_4. Once in room_4, go to red_ball_1 and be in front of it.

But there's a constraint that in at least one state, the agent is holding an object and red_door_1 is unlocked. Since red_door_1 is unlocked when the agent toggles it, and when they are carrying blue_ball_2, that would satisfy that constraint (when they are in room_3 with blue_ball_2, red_door_1 is already unlocked, so that state would have both conditions true).

Also, the agent must be in front of purple_door_2 at some point. Purple_door_2 is in room_4 (connecting to room_2). So when the agent is in room_4, they can go to purple_door_2. But since purple_door_2 must remain locked, the agent can't go through it. So after reaching room_4, the agent can gotoempty, then gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_2. But since they are in room_4, that's allowed. However, the constraint says that if they are in front of purple_door_2, then either they are in room_3 (they aren't, they're in room_4) or holding an object (maybe they can drop the red_ball_1 after picking it up, but the goal requires being in front of it). Wait, the goal is to be in front of the red_ball_1 in room_4. So perhaps after dropping it, but the red_ball_1 is already in room_4. Wait, no, the red_ball_1 is already in room_4. So the agent just needs to go to it. But maybe the agent needs to pick it up and drop it again? No, the goal is just to have it in room_4, which it already is. So the agent just needs to be in room_4 and in front of red_ball_1.

But let's outline the steps step by step:

1. Start in room_1. blue_ball_1 is here. The agent needs to unlock red_door_1. So gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3. Then toggle it. Now red_door_1 is unlocked. This satisfies the first constraint (red_door_1 not locked in at least one state).

2. Gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1. Now in room_3. Here, green_ball_1, green_ball_2, grey_ball_1, blue_ball_2 are present. Need to pick blue_ball_2 to bring to room_1.

3. gotoobject blue_ball_2 room_3. Then pick blue_ball_2 room_3. Now holding it.

4. Return to room_1: gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1. Then drop blue_ball_2 in room_1. This satisfies the constraint that blue_ball_2 is in room_1 at some point.

5. Now, need to get to room_4. The path is room_1 -> room_3 via red_door_1 (already unlocked), then room_3 to room_4 via yellow_door_1. But yellow_door_1 is locked. So first, in room_3, go to yellow_door_1. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_4. Toggle it to unlock. Now yellow_door_1 is unlocked, satisfying another constraint.

6. Gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_1. Now in room_4. Here, red_ball_1 and yellow_ball_1 are present. The goal is to be in room_4 in front of red_ball_1. So gotoobject red_ball_1 room_4. Now in front of it. That's the goal.

But wait, the constraints require that in at least one state, the agent is in front of purple_door_2. So while in room_4, the agent can go to purple_door_2. But when would that happen? Maybe after arriving in room_4, before going to red_ball_1, the agent can go to purple_door_2. Let's adjust the steps:

After step 6 (arriving in room_4), do:

7. gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_2. Now in front of purple_door_2. This satisfies the constraint. Then, since the agent is in room_4 (not room_3) and not holding any object (they dropped blue_ball_2 in room_1 and haven't picked anything else up), they need to hold an object either at that state or after. So after step 7, they need to pick up an object. But in room_4, there's red_ball_1 and yellow_ball_1. So after being in front of purple_door_2, they can gotoempty, then gotoobject red_ball_1, pick it up. But the goal requires that in the final state, the agent is in front of red_ball_1. If they pick it up, they can't be in front of it. So maybe after step 7, they go to purple_door_2, then go to red_ball_1, drop it (but they aren't holding it yet). Wait, maybe they need to hold an object after being in front of purple_door_2. So perhaps during the process, when they are in front of purple_door_2 (step 7), they need to be holding an object. But at that point, they are not holding anything. So maybe they need to pick up an object before going to purple_door_2. Let's think:

After arriving in room_4 (step 6), first gotoobject red_ball_1, pick it up. Then gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_2. Now, when they are in front of purple_door_2, they are holding red_ball_1. That satisfies the constraint that either they are in room_3 (no) or holding an object (yes). Then, they can drop red_ball_1 again to satisfy the goal. But the goal requires that the agent is in front of red_ball_1 in room_4. So the steps would be:

6. Arrive in room_4.

7. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_4.

8. pick red_ball_1 room_4. Now holding it.

9. gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_2. Now in front of purple_door_2, holding red_ball_1. This satisfies the constraint.

10. drop red_ball_1 room_4. Now in front of it. This achieves the goal.

But does this work? Let's check:

After step 9, the agent is in front of purple_door_2, holding red_ball_1. Then they drop it, which puts them in front of red_ball_1. The goal is to be in room_4, in front of red_ball_1. So that works.

But the problem is that the agent needs to have the red_ball_1 in room_4, which it already is. Picking it up and dropping it again would still leave it in room_4. So that's acceptable.

But let's check the constraints:

- "red_door_1 is not locked" in at least one state: yes, after step 1, it's unlocked.

- Never in room_2: correct.

- In front of purple_door_2 at some state: step 9.

- When in front of purple_door_2, agent is holding an object (red_ball_1), so constraint satisfied.

- yellow_door_1 is unlocked in at least one state: after step 5 (toggle).

- Agent is holding an object and red_door_1 is unlocked: when agent is holding blue_ball_2 in room_1, after dropping it, they are not holding. But when they are in room_3, after picking blue_ball_2, red_door_1 is unlocked. So the state after step 3 (picking blue_ball_2 in room_3), red_door_1 is unlocked. So that satisfies the constraint.

- purple_door_2 remains locked always: yes, since we never toggle it.

- blue_ball_2 is in room_1 at some point: after step 4 (drop).

So the plan would be:

1. gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3

2. toggle red_door_1

3. gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1

4. gotoobject blue_ball_2 room_3

5. pick blue_ball_2 room_3

6. gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1

7. drop blue_ball_2 room_1

8. gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1

9. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_4

10. toggle yellow_door_1

11. gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_1

12. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_4

13. pick red_ball_1 room_4

14. gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_2

15. drop red_ball_1 room_4

Wait, but after step 13, the agent is holding red_ball_1, then they go to purple_door_2 (step14), then drop it (step15). After dropping, they are in front of red_ball_1 in room_4. That achieves the goal.

But step 8: the agent is in room_1 after step7. To get back to room_3, they need to use red_door_1 again. So steps 8-11: gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1 (step8), then goto yellow_door_1 in room3 (step9), toggle (step10), then goto room4 (step11).

This plan seems to satisfy all constraints. Let's check the order and count steps.

But wait, maybe there's a shorter path. For example, after dropping blue_ball_2 in room_1 (step7), the agent is in room_1. They need to go back to room_3, unlock yellow_door_1, go to room4, etc. Is there a way to avoid going back to room_1 again? Let's see. The constraint that blue_ball_2 must be in room_1 requires that at some point, it's there. So after step7, it's there. Then the agent can proceed to room3 again. But that's necessary.

Alternatively, perhaps after bringing blue_ball_2 to room1, the agent can go directly to room3, then proceed to unlock yellow door. So steps would be:

But the steps above already do that.

Another point: the agent must be in room4 in front of red_ball_1. The final action is drop red_ball_1, which puts them in front of it. So the final state is correct.

Also, when the agent is in front of purple_door_2 (step14), they are holding red_ball_1, which satisfies the conditional constraint.

Another constraint: the agent must have yellow_door_1 unlocked at some point. Step10 toggles it from locked to unlocked, so that's satisfied.

Now, checking the constraints again:

- red_door_1 unlocked in at least one state: yes (steps 2 onwards).

- Never in room_2: correct.

- In front of purple_door_2: step14.

- When in front of purple_door_2, holding red_ball_1 (step14) satisfies the condition.

- yellow_door_1 unlocked: yes, step10.

- Holding an object and red_door_1 unlocked: when the agent is in room3 after step3, holding blue_ball_2, and red_door_1 is unlocked. So that's satisfied.

- purple_door_2 remains locked: yes, never toggled.

- blue_ball_2 in room1: step7.

This seems to cover all constraints. Now, is this the optimal plan? Let's see if there's a shorter way.

Alternative approach: After step7 (blue_ball_2 in room1), the agent is in room1. Instead of going back to room3, maybe take a different route? But to get to room4, they must go through room3 and then room4 via yellow_door_1. So steps 8-11 are necessary.

Another possible optimization: When in room3 after step3 (picking blue_ball_2), maybe proceed directly to unlock yellow_door_1 before returning to room1. But that would require carrying blue_ball_2 while unlocking yellow_door_1, but that's allowed. However, the agent needs to drop blue_ball_2 in room1 to satisfy the constraint. Let's see:

Alternative steps:

After step5 (pick blue_ball_2), instead of going back to room1 immediately:

5. pick blue_ball_2 room3

6. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room3 room4

7. toggle yellow_door_1

8. gotoroom room3 room4 yellow_door_1

But wait, this skips dropping blue_ball_2 in room1. But the constraint requires blue_ball_2 to be in room1 at some point. So this approach wouldn't satisfy that. So the initial plan is necessary.

So the initial plan's steps are necessary. Let's count the steps:

The initial plan I outlined has 15 steps. Let's check each action:

1. gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3

2. toggle red_door_1

3. gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1

4. gotoobject blue_ball_2 room3

5. pick blue_ball_2 room3

6. gotoroom room3 room1 red_door_1

7. drop blue_ball_2 room1

8. gotoroom room1 room3 red_door_1

9. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room3 room4

10. toggle yellow_door_1

11. gotoroom room3 room4 yellow_door_1

12. gotoobject red_ball_1 room4

13. pick red_ball_1 room4

14. gotodoor purple_door_2 room4 room2

15. drop red_ball_1 room4

But after step13, the agent is holding red_ball_1. To drop it, they need to be in front of an empty position. Wait, the 'drop' action requires that the position in front is empty. When they pick red_ball_1, they are no longer in front of it. So after picking, they need to go to an empty position to drop. But the goal requires being in front of it. Hmm, this complicates things.

Wait, the 'drop' action places the object in front of the agent. So after picking red_ball_1, if the agent goes to an empty spot and drops it, they will be in front of it. Alternatively, they can drop it immediately after picking, but that's not possible because when you pick, you are no longer in front of the object. Let's clarify the effects of 'pick' and 'drop':

After 'pick x r', the agent is no longer in front of x, and is carrying x. To drop x, they need to be in front of an empty position. So to drop x in front of themselves, they need to gotoempty first, then drop.

But the goal requires the agent to be in front of red_ball_1 in room4. So the red_ball_1 must be in room4 (which it is initially), and the agent must be in front of it. But if the agent picks it up and drops it again, then they can be in front of it after dropping.

So the steps would be:

After arriving in room4 (step11):

12. gotoempty (to have an empty spot)

13. drop red_ball_1 room4 (but they aren't holding it yet). Wait, no. They need to pick it up first.

So correct steps:

11. gotoobject red_ball_1 room4

12. pick red_ball_1 room4

13. gotoempty

14. drop red_ball_1 room4

Now, after step14, they are in front of red_ball_1. But this adds steps. Alternatively, after picking, go to an empty spot and drop. But maybe there's a way to optimize.

Alternatively, after arriving in room4, the agent can go directly to red_ball_1, pick it up, then go to an empty spot, drop it, which places it in front. But that requires more steps.

But the goal is to have the agent in front of red_ball_1. So if the agent is in front of it without picking it up, that's better. But how? Since the red_ball_1 is already in room4. So the agent can just gotoobject red_ball_1 room4. Then they are in front of it, and in room4. So that achieves the goal without picking it up.

But why was the initial plan involving picking and dropping? Because of the constraint that when the agent is in front of purple_door_2, they need to be holding an object or be in room3. So if the agent goes to purple_door_2 after being in front of red_ball_1, but without holding anything, then they need to pick something up. Alternatively, perhaps the agent can go to purple_door_2 first, then go to red_ball_1.

Let me re-express the plan without picking up red_ball_1:

After step11 (arrive in room4):

12. gotodoor purple_door_2 room4 room2 (to satisfy the constraint)

At this point, the agent is in front of purple_door_2. Since they aren't holding anything, they need to be in room3 or holding something. But they are in room4. So they need to pick up an object. But the only objects in room4 are red_ball_1 and yellow_ball_1. So:

13. gotoobject red_ball_1 room4

14. pick red_ball_1 room4

Now holding it, which satisfies the constraint (since after being in front of purple_door_2, they are now holding an object). Then, they need to drop it to be in front of it.

15. gotoempty

16. drop red_ball_1 room4

Now in front of red_ball_1. But this adds more steps. The previous approach had the agent pick up red_ball_1, go to purple_door_2 (holding it), then drop it. Let's see:

Alternative plan after step11:

12. gotoobject red_ball_1 room4

13. pick red_ball_1 room4

14. gotodoor purple_door_2 room4 room2 (now holding red_ball_1, which satisfies the constraint)

15. gotoempty

16. drop red_ball_1 room4

This achieves the goal and satisfies the constraint. But step15 and 16 are needed.

Alternatively, after step14 (in front of purple_door_2, holding red_ball_1), the agent can drop it there. But dropping requires being in front of an empty position. If the agent is in front of purple_door_2, which is a door, then the position in front is the door, which is not empty. So they need to gotoempty first.

Thus, the steps are:

11. gotoobject red_ball_1 room4

12. pick red_ball_1 room4

13. gotodoor purple_door_2 room4 room2

14. gotoempty

15. drop red_ball_1 room4

Now, the agent is in front of red_ball_1 in room4. This requires 15 steps. But perhaps there's a way to optimize this.

Wait, the agent can be in front of red_ball_1 without picking it up. So the minimal steps would be:

After arriving in room4:

11. gotoobject red_ball_1 room4 (now in front of it, in room4: goal achieved)

But then, the constraint to be in front of purple_door_2 is not satisfied. So the agent needs to go to purple_door_2 at some point. So the steps would be:

11. gotodoor purple_door_2 room4 room2

12. gotoempty (since after being in front of the door, they need to satisfy the constraint. But they aren't holding anything, so they need to pick up an object. But they can't pick up anything if they are in front of the door. So:

13. gotoobject red_ball_1 room4

14. pick red_ball_1 room4 (now holding it)

15. gotoempty

16. drop red_ball_1 room4

But this adds steps. So the initial plan with the agent picking up red_ball_1, going to the door, then dropping it is necessary.

Hmm. It's a bit complex. The optimal plan should have the fewest steps. Let's try to find the shortest possible.

Alternative approach:

1. Unlock red_door_1.

2. Go to room3, pick blue_ball_2, bring to room1.

3. Go back to room3, unlock yellow_door_1.

4. Go to room4.

5. Go to purple_door_2 in room4.

6. Go to red_ball_1, be in front of it.

But how to satisfy the constraints in this flow.

Step-by-step:

1. gotodoor red_door_1 room1 room3

2. toggle red_door_1 (unlocked)

3. gotoroom room1 room3 red_door_1

4. gotoobject blue_ball_2 room3

5. pick blue_ball_2 room3

6. gotoroom room3 room1 red_door_1

7. drop blue_ball_2 room1 (constraint satisfied)

8. gotoroom room1 room3 red_door_1

9. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room3 room4

10. toggle yellow_door_1 (unlocked)

11. gotoroom room3 room4 yellow_door_1

12. gotodoor purple_door_2 room4 room2 (constraint to be in front of it)

13. Now, need to either be in room3 or holding object. Since in room4, must hold object. So:

13. gotoobject red_ball_1 room4

14. pick red_ball_1 room4

15. gotodoor purple_door_2 room4 room2 (now holding it, satisfies constraint)

16. gotoempty

17. drop red_ball_1 room4

But this is 17 steps. The previous approach was shorter.

Alternative plan after step11:

11. gotodoor purple_door_2 room4 room2 (step12)

12. gotoobject red_ball_1 room4 (step13)

13. pick red_ball_1 room4 (step14)

14. Now, after step12 (in front of purple_door_2), the agent is in room4 and not holding anything. So they need to pick up an object. So after step12, they must pick up an object. So:

12. gotodoor purple_door_2 room4 room2

13. gotoobject red_ball_1 room4

14. pick red_ball_1 room4 (now holding it, satisfies constraint)

15. gotoempty

16. drop red_ball_1 room4

This brings the steps to 16. But maybe there's a way to combine steps.

Wait, after step11 (arrived in room4), the agent can go to purple_door_2 first:

11. gotodoor purple_door_2 room4 room2 (step12)

12. gotoobject red_ball_1 room4 (step13)

13. pick red_ball_1 room4 (step14)

14. Now, in front of red_ball_1? No, after picking, they are no longer in front of it. So need to drop.

14. gotoempty

15. drop red_ball_1 room4 (step15)

So total steps: 15.

But how to get from room4 arrival to purple_door_2:

Arrival in room4 (step11).

Step12: gotodoor purple_door_2 room4 room2.

Step13: gotoobject red_ball_1 room4.

Step14: pick red_ball_1 room4.

Step15: gotoempty

Step16: drop red_ball_1 room4.

Total steps: 16. But the initial plan had 15 steps. Maybe there's a better way.

Alternative: After arriving in room4 (step11), go to purple_door_2, then pick up an object, drop it, but that's more steps.

The optimal plan likely requires 15 steps. Let's recheck:

Original plan steps:

1. gotodoor red_door_1 room1 room3

2. toggle red_door_1

3. gotoroom room1 room3 red_door_1

4. gotoobject blue_ball_2 room3

5. pick blue_ball_2 room3

6. gotoroom room3 room1 red_door_1

7. drop blue_ball_2 room1

8. gotoroom room1 room3 red_door_1

9. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room3 room4

10. toggle yellow_door_1

11. gotoroom room3 room4 yellow_door_1

12. gotoobject red_ball_1 room4

13. pick red_ball_1 room4

14. gotodoor purple_door_2 room4 room2

15. drop red_ball_1 room4

Wait, step15: drop requires being in front of an empty position. But after step14, the agent is in front of purple_door_2. So to drop, they need to gotoempty first.

So steps should be:

14. gotodoor purple_door_2 room4 room2

15. gotoempty

16. drop red_ball_1 room4

So now it's 16 steps. This complicates things.

Alternatively, after step13 (picking red_ball_1), go to an empty spot, then drop:

13. pick red_ball_1 room4

14. gotoempty

15. drop red_ball_1 room4

16. gotodoor purple_door_2 room4 room2

But then, being in front of purple_door_2 (step16) happens after dropping, so the agent isn't holding anything. So they need to pick up again. Which adds steps.

This is getting quite tangled. Maybe the optimal plan is longer than I thought. However, considering the constraints, perhaps there's a smarter way.

Alternative approach:

The agent needs to be in front of purple_door_2 at some point. To do that, they can go there after arriving in room4. But at that point, they aren't holding anything, so they need to pick up an object. So:

After arriving in room4:

1. gotodoor purple_door_2 room4 room2

2. gotoobject red_ball_1 room4

3. pick red_ball_1 room4

Now holding it, which satisfies the constraint. Then, drop it in front of themselves:

4. gotoempty

5. drop red_ball_1 room4

This adds five steps after arriving in room4.

But to get to room4, the steps are:

Unlock red_door_1, go to room3, unlock yellow_door_1, go to room4.

Then handle purple_door_2 and red_ball_1.

Total steps:

1. gotodoor red_door_1 room1 room3

2. toggle red_door_1

3. gotoroom room1 room3 red_door_1

4. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room3 room4

5. toggle yellow_door_1

6. gotoroom room3 room4 yellow_door_1

7. gotodoor purple_door_2 room4 room2

8. gotoobject red_ball_1 room4

9. pick red_ball_1 room4

10. gotoempty

11. drop red_ball_1 room4

But also need to bring blue_ball_2 to room1. So inserting those steps:

After step3:

3a. gotoobject blue_ball_2 room3

3b. pick blue_ball_2 room3

3c. gotoroom room3 room1 red_door_1

3d. drop blue_ball_2 room1

3e. gotoroom room1 room3 red_door_1

Then proceed to steps4-11.

This makes the total steps much longer. So the initial plan with 15 steps seems more optimal, but perhaps there's a way to optimize.

Another idea: Maybe after bringing blue_ball_2 to room1, the agent can go directly to room3 and then to room4 without returning to room1 again. Let's see:

Steps:

1. gotodoor red_door_1 room1 room3

2. toggle red_door_1

3. gotoroom room1 room3 red_door_1

4. gotoobject blue_ball_2 room3

5. pick blue_ball_2 room3

6. gotoroom room3 room1 red_door_1

7. drop blue_ball_2 room1

8. gotoroom room1 room3 red_door_1

9. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room3 room4

10. toggle yellow_door_1

11. gotoroom room3 room4 yellow_door_1

12. gotodoor purple_door_2 room4 room2

13. gotoobject red_ball_1 room4

14. pick red_ball_1 room4

15. gotoempty

16. drop red_ball_1 room4

But this is 16 steps. Is there a way to reduce this?

Alternatively, after step7 (drop blue_ball_2 in room1), the agent can go directly to room3, unlock yellow door, go to room4, and proceed. But the steps are necessary.

Another optimization: After step7, the agent is in room1. They need to go back to room3 to unlock yellow_door_1. This requires steps8: gotoroom room1 room3 red_door_1. Which is step8.

Is there a way to combine steps? For example, after dropping blue_ball_2 in room1, immediately go to yellow_door_1. But the agent is in room1, and yellow_door_1 is in room3. So no.

Thus, the minimal steps seem to be around 16. However, perhaps there's a way to avoid some steps.

Wait, the agent needs to toggle yellow_door_1. But if the agent is in room3, and yellow_door_1 connects to room4. So the agent can go to the door in room3, toggle it, then go to room4.

Another point: when the agent is in room3 after step3a, they can unlock yellow_door_1 before bringing blue_ball_2 to room1. That way, when they return to room3 after dropping blue_ball_2, they don't need to unlock yellow_door_1 again. But would that work?

Alternative steps:

1. gotodoor red_door_1 room1 room3

2. toggle red_door_1

3. gotoroom room1 room3 red_door_1

4. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room3 room4

5. toggle yellow_door_1 (now unlocked)

6. gotoobject blue_ball_2 room3

7. pick blue_ball_2 room3

8. gotoroom room3 room1 red_door_1

9. drop blue_ball_2 room1

10. gotoroom room1 room3 red_door_1

11. gotoroom room3 room4 yellow_door_1

12. gotodoor purple_door_2 room4 room2

13. gotoobject red_ball_1 room4

14. pick red_ball_1 room4

15. gotoempty

16. drop red_ball_1 room4

This reduces the steps by combining the unlocking of yellow_door_1 earlier. Now steps4 and5 are done before picking up blue_ball_2. Then when returning to room3 after step9, they can go directly to room4 via yellow_door_1.

This plan has 16 steps. But wait, after step5 (toggle yellow_door_1), the agent is in front of yellow_door_1. To pick blue_ball_2, they need to gotoobject blue_ball_2 room3. So steps:

After step5:

6. gotoobject blue_ball_2 room3

7. pick blue_ball_2 room3

8. gotoroom room3 room1 red_door_1

9. drop blue_ball_2 room1

10. gotoroom room1 room3 red_door_1

11. gotoroom room3 room4 yellow_door_1 (since yellow_door_1 is already unlocked)

12. gotodoor purple_door_2 room4 room2

13. gotoobject red_ball_1 room4

14. pick red_ball_1 room4

15. gotoempty

16. drop red_ball_1 room4

This is 16 steps, but avoids having to toggle yellow_door_1 again. So this seems better.

But does this satisfy the constraint that yellow_door_1 is unlocked in at least one state? Yes, step5 toggles it to unlocked. And the constraint is satisfied.

But wait, initially, yellow_door_1 is locked. Toggling it once unlocks it. So step5: toggle makes it unlocked. Then when the agent uses gotoroom room3 room4 yellow_door_1 (step11), the door is unlocked, so they can pass. This works.

Now, this plan has 16 steps. But perhaps it's optimal. Let's check if any steps can be merged or skipped.

Another optimization: After step5 (toggle yellow_door_1), the agent is in front of it. Can they go directly to room4 without going back to blue_ball_2? But they need to bring blue_ball_2 to room1. So steps6-9 are necessary.

Yes, this seems necessary.

So the final plan would be:

1. gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3

2. toggle red_door_1

3. gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1

4. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_4

5. toggle yellow_door_1

6. gotoobject blue_ball_2 room_3

7. pick blue_ball_2 room_3

8. gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1

9. drop blue_ball_2 room_1

10. gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1

11. gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_1

12. gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_2

13. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_4

14. pick red_ball_1 room_4

15. gotoempty

16. drop red_ball_1 room_4

But step15 and 16 are needed to drop the ball in front of the agent.

But the goal requires being in front of red_ball_1. When the agent drops it in step16, they are in front of it. So this satisfies the goal.

Now, checking all constraints:

- red_door_1 is unlocked: step2.

- Never in room_2: correct.

- In front of purple_door_2: step12.

- When in front of purple_door_2 (step12), the agent is in room4 and not holding anything. So they need to pick up an object after that. Steps13-14 do that.

- yellow_door_1 is unlocked: step5.

- Holding an object and red_door_1 unlocked: step7 (holding blue_ball_2) and red_door_1 is unlocked.

- purple_door_2 remains locked: yes.

- blue_ball_2 in room1: step9.

This plan satisfies all constraints and has 16 steps. Is there a way to reduce this?

Wait, after step12 (in front of purple_door_2), the agent needs to pick up an object. But they could pick up red_ball_1, which is in room4. So steps13-14:

13. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_4

14. pick red_ball_1 room_4

Then drop it:

15. gotoempty

16. drop red_ball_1 room_4

But perhaps after step14, the agent can go directly to drop without going to empty. But drop requires being in front of an empty position. When they pick up red_ball_1, they are no longer in front of it. So they need to gotoempty to drop it in front.

Thus, steps15-16 are necessary.

Alternative idea: After step11 (arrive in room4), first go to purple_door_2, then pick up red_ball_1, then drop it. But this requires similar steps.

Alternatively, after step11:

11. gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_1

12. gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_2

13. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_4

14. pick red_ball_1 room_4

15. gotoempty

16. drop red_ball_1 room_4

This is the same as before.

I think this is the optimal plan given the constraints. It's 16 steps. Any further reduction would require violating a constraint. So this should be the answer.
