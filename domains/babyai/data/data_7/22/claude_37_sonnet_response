Let me carefully analyze this gridworld planning problem and identify the necessary steps to achieve the goal while satisfying all constraints.

First, let's understand the goal:
- We need to have a door d such that: d is grey, we are in front of d, and d is not locked.

The only grey door is grey_door_1, so our goal is to be in front of grey_door_1 when it's unlocked.

Let's examine the constraints and what they imply:

1. "red_door_1 is locked" must hold in at least one state.
   - Given that all doors start locked, this is initially true.

2. If "red_door_1 is locked" holds in a state, then at that state or sometime after, we must either be holding grey_ball_1 or be in room_1.
   - So after we encounter the state where red_door_1 is locked, we need to either pick up grey_ball_1 or enter room_1.

3. "you are not in room_4" must hold in every state.
   - We cannot enter room_4 at any point.

4. "you are in front of grey_door_1" must hold in at least one state.
   - We need to go in front of grey_door_1 at some point.

5. If "you are in front of grey_door_1", then there must be an earlier state where we are holding some object or specifically holding yellow_box_2.
   - Before going in front of grey_door_1, we need to pick up an object.

6. "you are in room_2" must hold in at least one state.
   - Given that we start in room_2, this is initially true.

7. If "you are in room_2", then at that state or sometime after, "red_ball_4 is in room_3" must hold.
   - Since we start in room_2, we need to ensure red_ball_4 gets to room_3 at some point.

8. "you are holding red_ball_4" must hold in at least one state.
   - We need to pick up red_ball_4 at some point.

9. "grey_door_1 is not locked" must hold in at least one state.
   - We need to unlock grey_door_1 at some point.

10. If "grey_door_1 is not locked", then there must be an earlier state where "you are holding some object".
    - Before unlocking grey_door_1, we need to pick up an object.

11. "grey_door_1 is locked" must hold in at least one state.
    - Given that all doors start locked, this is initially true.

12. If "grey_door_1 is locked", then at that state or sometime after, "you are in front of red_ball_4" must hold.
    - After we encounter the state where grey_door_1 is locked, we need to go in front of red_ball_4.

Now let's develop a plan to satisfy all these constraints:

Initial state:
- We are in room_2
- All doors are locked
- red_ball_4 is in room_2
- grey_ball_1 is in room_2

1. We need to pick up red_ball_4 (satisfies constraint 8)
   - First, go to red_ball_4
   - Then pick up red_ball_4

2. We need to move red_ball_4 to room_3 (to satisfy constraint 7)
   - We need to go through yellow_door_1 to room_1, then through purple_door_1 to room_3
   - This requires unlocking yellow_door_1 and purple_door_1
   - First, go to yellow_door_1
   - Toggle yellow_door_1 to unlock it
   - Go to room_1 through yellow_door_1
   - Now we're in room_1 (satisfies part of constraint 2)
   - Go to purple_door_1
   - Toggle purple_door_1 to unlock it
   - Go to room_3 through purple_door_1
   - Drop red_ball_4 in room_3 (satisfies constraint 7)

3. We need to satisfy constraint 12 by going in front of red_ball_4
   - Since we just dropped red_ball_4, we're already in front of it

4. We need to satisfy constraint 5 by picking up an object before going in front of grey_door_1
   - We're in room_3, and purple_ball_1 and yellow_box_1 are there
   - Go to purple_ball_1
   - Pick up purple_ball_1

5. We need to go in front of grey_door_1 (satisfies constraint 4)
   - grey_door_1 connects room_3 and room_4, but we can't enter room_4 (constraint 3)
   - So we need to go to grey_door_1 from room_3
   - Go to grey_door_1

6. We need to unlock grey_door_1 (to satisfy constraint 9)
   - We're already holding an object (satisfies constraint 10)
   - Toggle grey_door_1 to unlock it

7. Now we've achieved our goal: we're in front of grey_door_1, it's grey, and it's unlocked

Let me write out the plan step by step:

1. gotoobject red_ball_4 room_2
2. pick red_ball_4 room_2
3. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_1
4. toggle yellow_door_1
5. gotoroom room_2 room_1 yellow_door_1
6. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_3
7. toggle purple_door_1
8. gotoroom room_1 room_3 purple_door_1
9. gotoempty
10. drop red_ball_4 room_3
11. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_3
12. pick purple_ball_1 room_3
13. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4
14. toggle grey_door_1

Let me verify this plan against all the constraints:

1. "red_door_1 is locked" must hold in at least one state.
   - This is true in the initial state and we never unlock red_door_1.

2. If "red_door_1 is locked" holds in a state, then at that state or sometime after, we must either be holding grey_ball_1 or be in room_1.
   - We enter room_1 in step 5.

3. "you are not in room_4" must hold in every state.
   - We never enter room_4 in this plan.

4. "you are in front of grey_door_1" must hold in at least one state.
   - We go in front of grey_door_1 in step 13.

5. If "you are in front of grey_door_1", then there must be an earlier state where we are holding some object or specifically holding yellow_box_2.
   - We pick up purple_ball_1 in step 12, before going in front of grey_door_1.

6. "you are in room_2" must hold in at least one state.
   - We start in room_2.

7. If "you are in room_2", then at that state or sometime after, "red_ball_4 is in room_3" must hold.
   - We drop red_ball_4 in room_3 in step 10.

8. "you are holding red_ball_4" must hold in at least one state.
   - We pick up red_ball_4 in step 2.

9. "grey_door_1 is not locked" must hold in at least one state.
   - We unlock grey_door_1 in step 14.

10. If "grey_door_1 is not locked", then there must be an earlier state where "you are holding some object".
    - We're holding purple_ball_1 when we unlock grey_door_1.

11. "grey_door_1 is locked" must hold in at least one state.
    - This is true in the initial state.

12. If "grey_door_1 is locked", then at that state or sometime after, "you are in front of red_ball_4" must hold.
    - We go in front of red_ball_4 in step 1.

Wait, there's a problem here. Let's read constraint 12 again: "If 'grey_door_1 is locked' holds in a state s, then 'you are in front of red_ball_4' must hold at s or at some state after s."

In my plan, grey_door_1 is locked in the initial state, but we go to red_ball_4 in step 1, not to be in front of it. Let me refine the plan to make sure we're in front of red_ball_4 at some point when grey_door_1 is locked (which is true for all states until step 14).

1. gotoobject red_ball_4 room_2
   - Now we're in front of red_ball_4 while grey_door_1 is locked (satisfies constraint 12)
2. pick red_ball_4 room_2
3. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_1
4. toggle yellow_door_1
5. gotoroom room_2 room_1 yellow_door_1
6. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_3
7. toggle purple_door_1
8. gotoroom room_1 room_3 purple_door_1
9. gotoempty
10. drop red_ball_4 room_3
11. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_3
12. pick purple_ball_1 room_3
13. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4
14. toggle grey_door_1

This plan should now satisfy all constraints. Let's check once more:

1. "red_door_1 is locked" must hold in at least one state.
   - This is true in the initial state and throughout our plan as we never unlock red_door_1.

2. If "red_door_1 is locked" holds in a state, then at that state or sometime after, we must either be holding grey_ball_1 or be in room_1.
   - red_door_1 is locked in the initial state, and we enter room_1 in step 5.

3. "you are not in room_4" must hold in every state.
   - We never enter room_4 in this plan.

4. "you are in front of grey_door_1" must hold in at least one state.
   - We go in front of grey_door_1 in step 13.

5. If "you are in front of grey_door_1", then there must be an earlier state where we are holding some object or specifically holding yellow_box_2.
   - We pick up purple_ball_1 in step 12, before going in front of grey_door_1.

6. "you are in room_2" must hold in at least one state.
   - We start in room_2.

7. If "you are in room_2", then at that state or sometime after, "red_ball_4 is in room_3" must hold.
   - We drop red_ball_4 in room_3 in step 10.

8. "you are holding red_ball_4" must hold in at least one state.
   - We pick up red_ball_4 in step 2.

9. "grey_door_1 is not locked" must hold in at least one state.
   - We unlock grey_door_1 in step 14.

10. If "grey_door_1 is not locked", then there must be an earlier state where "you are holding some object".
    - We pick up purple_ball_1 in step 12, before unlocking grey_door_1.

11. "grey_door_1 is locked" must hold in at least one state.
    - This is true in the initial state.

12. If "grey_door_1 is locked", then at that state or sometime after, "you are in front of red_ball_4" must hold.
    - We go in front of red_ball_4 in step 1.

The plan satisfies all constraints, and our goal is achieved in the final state: we are in front of grey_door_1, it is grey, and it is unlocked.

In summary, our optimal plan is:

1. gotoobject red_ball_4 room_2
2. pick red_ball_4 room_2
3. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_1
4. toggle yellow_door_1
5. gotoroom room_2 room_1 yellow_door_1
6. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_3
7. toggle purple_door_1
8. gotoroom room_1 room_3 purple_door_1
9. gotoempty
10. drop red_ball_4 room_3
11. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_3
12. pick purple_ball_1 room_3
13. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4
14. toggle grey_door_1
