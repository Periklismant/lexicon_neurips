Okay, let's try to figure out this planning problem. The goal is to end up in front of a grey door that's unlocked. But there are a bunch of constraints to satisfy. Let me start by listing all the constraints and the goal to make sure I don't miss any.

First, the goal: There exists a door d that is grey, I'm in front of it, and it's not locked. Looking at the doors, the grey door is grey_door_1, which connects room_3 and room_4. But the constraints say I can never be in room_4. So, I need to be in front of grey_door_1 from room_3? Because room_4 is off-limits.

Constraints:

1. At least one state where red_door_1 is locked. But if it's locked in any state, I must either be holding grey_ball_1 or be in room_1 at that state or later. Since red_door_1 starts locked, maybe that's the state? But initial state: red_door_1 is locked, and the agent is in room_2. So the initial state meets the first part (red_door_1 is locked). But then the second constraint requires that in that state or a later one, the agent is in room_1 or holding grey_ball_1. Since the agent starts in room_2, not room_1, and not holding anything. So, if the initial state counts as a state where red_door_1 is locked, then we need to ensure that either at that state or later, the agent is in room_1 or holds grey_ball_1. But the initial state doesn't satisfy those, so later states must. So the agent must either go to room_1 or pick up grey_ball_1 at some point after the initial state.

2. Never be in room_4. So all actions must avoid room_4. So can't use gotoroom to room_4.

3. At least one state where in front of grey_door_1. But before that, must have held some object or yellow_box_2. Since yellow_box_2 is in room_4, which is inaccessible, so the agent can't pick it up. So must hold another object. Possible objects: red_ball_1 (room_1), grey_ball_1 (room_2), red_balls 2-4 (room_2), purple_ball_1 (room_3), yellow_box_1 (room_3). So agent needs to pick up one of these before going to grey_door_1.

4. At least one state in room_2. The agent starts there, but maybe leaves. So need to return to room_2 at some point, but when in room_2, red_ball_4 must be in room_3 at that state or later. So after being in room_2, need to move red_ball_4 to room_3. So red_ball_4 starts in room_2. To move it to room_3, the agent must pick it up, carry it through doors to room_3, then drop it. But doors are locked. Let's check the doors.

Doors: yellow_door_1 connects room_1 and 2. purple_door_1 connects 1 and 3. red_door_1 connects 2 and 4 (but room_4 is forbidden). grey_door_1 connects 3 and 4 (also forbidden). All doors start locked.

So to move between rooms, the agent needs to toggle doors. But toggle requires being in front of the door. To get in front of a door, the agent must be in a room connected by that door and the door's position isn't blocked.

Wait, the "goto door" action requires that the agent is in a room connected by the door and that there's no object blocking the position in front of the door. So if an object is in front of the door in that room, you can't go there. So in the initial state, are any objects blocking doors?

Looking at the initial state: In room_2, the objects are grey_ball_1, red_balls 2-4. Are any of these in front of a door? The problem doesn't specify positions, just which room objects are in. So perhaps the objects are not blocking the doors unless specified. Assuming that objects are not blocking doors unless stated. So, maybe the doors are accessible.

But the agent starts in room_2. To unlock yellow_door_1 (connecting room_1 and 2), which is locked. So if the agent can go to yellow_door_1 in room_2, toggle it, then go to room_1. But yellow_door_1 is yellow. So steps:

1. gotoempty (since agent is in room_2, not in front of anything, maybe needs to move to empty spot first? Or maybe can directly go to the door. Let me check the preconditions for gotodoor. The agent must be in a room connected by the door. So from room_2, yellow_door_1 connects to room_1. So gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_1. But need to check if any object is blocking the door in room_2. Since the initial state has grey_ball_1 and red_balls in room_2, but unless they are blocking, which isn't stated, we can proceed.

Assuming no blocking, so:

Action: gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_1. Then toggle yellow_door_1 (since it's locked). Then gotoroom room_2 room_1 yellow_door_1. Then the agent is in room_1.

But why go to room_1? To satisfy the constraint that when red_door_1 is locked (which it is initially), the agent must be in room_1 or hold grey_ball_1. But in the initial state, the agent is in room_2, so that state would violate the constraint unless later they go to room_1 or pick up grey_ball_1. Wait, the constraint says: if red_door_1 is locked in state s, then in s or some state after, agent is in room_1 or holding grey_ball_1. So the initial state has red_door_1 locked, and agent in room_2. So after that, the agent must at some point go to room_1 or pick up grey_ball_1. So either:

Option 1: Go to room_1 at some point.

Option 2: Pick up grey_ball_1.

But let's see. If the agent picks up grey_ball_1, that would satisfy the constraint. But maybe the plan requires moving red_ball_4 to room_3, which would involve carrying it through rooms. Let's think.

The goal requires a grey door (grey_door_1) to be unlocked and in front of it. But grey_door_1 connects room_3 and 4. Since room_4 is forbidden, the agent must approach grey_door_1 from room_3. So need to get to room_3.

How to get to room_3? From room_1 via purple_door_1. Or from room_4 via grey_door_1, but room_4 is forbidden. So the path is room_2 -> room_1 via yellow_door_1, then room_1 -> room_3 via purple_door_1. Both doors are initially locked. So need to unlock them.

So steps:

1. In room_2, go to yellow_door_1 (gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_1)
2. Toggle yellow_door_1 to unlock it.
3. Gotoroom room_2 room_1 yellow_door_1. Now in room_1.
4. Then, go to purple_door_1 in room_1 (gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_3)
5. Toggle purple_door_1 to unlock.
6. Gotoroom room_1 room_3 purple_door_1. Now in room_3.
7. Now, in room_3, need to get to grey_door_1. But grey_door_1 connects to room_4, which is forbidden. But to be in front of grey_door_1, the agent can be in room_3 and go to the door. So gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4. But need to check if any object is blocking. In room_3, there's yellow_box_1 and purple_ball_1. If they are not blocking the door, then possible.

But before that, the constraint says that when going to grey_door_1, the agent must have previously held some object. So need to pick up an object before going to grey_door_1. Let's see. The objects in room_3 are purple_ball_1 and yellow_box_1. So pick up purple_ball_1.

So steps:

After step 6 (in room_3):

7. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_3
8. pick purple_ball_1 room_3
9. Then, gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4 (since agent is in room_3)
10. Toggle grey_door_1 (it's locked initially, so unlock it)
11. Now, the goal is to have grey_door_1 unlocked and be in front of it. So step 10 satisfies the toggle, but after that, the agent is in front of grey_door_1, and the door is unlocked. So that would meet the goal. But need to check if after toggling, the door is unlocked.

Wait, the toggle action changes the state: if locked, unlock; if unlocked, lock. So initial state: grey_door_1 is locked. So step 10 would unlock it. Then, the agent is in front of grey_door_1, which is now unlocked. So that would satisfy the goal: being in front of a grey door that's not locked.

But wait, the goal requires that there exists a door d where d is grey, agent is in front of d, and d is not locked. So after step 10, grey_door_1 is unlocked, and agent is in front of it. So that satisfies the goal. But the plan also needs to meet all constraints.

Let's check the constraints again:

- Constraint 4: At least one state where in front of grey_door_1. That's step 9 (gotodoor) and step 10 (toggle). So that's covered.

- Constraint 5: Before being in front of grey_door_1, must have held some object. So steps 7-8: pick up purple_ball_1. Then steps 9-10. So that's satisfied.

- Constraint 8: At least one state where grey_door_1 is not locked. Step 10 toggles it to unlocked.

- Constraint 9: If grey_door_1 is unlocked, must have held an object before. Which is satisfied by step 8 (holding purple_ball_1).

- Constraint 10: At least one state where grey_door_1 is locked. Initially, it is locked. So the initial state satisfies this. Then step 10 unlocks it. So the initial state counts. But the constraint says "in at least one state", which includes the initial state.

- Constraint 11: If grey_door_1 is locked in some state, then in that state or later, agent is in front of red_ball_4. The initial state has grey_door_1 locked. So need to be in front of red_ball_4 at some point. But red_ball_4 is in room_2 initially. So the agent needs to be in room_2 and in front of red_ball_4. But when?

Also, constraint 7: When in room_2 (at any state s), then red_ball_4 must be in room_3 at s or later. So the agent starts in room_2. So in the initial state, red_ball_4 is in room_2. Therefore, the agent must, after the initial state, move red_ball_4 to room_3. But how?

The agent is starting in room_2. So to move red_ball_4 to room_3, the agent needs to pick it up in room_2, then carry it through rooms to room_3. Let's see. The agent is in room_2. To get to room_3, the path is room_2 -> room_1 via yellow_door_1, then room_1 -> room_3 via purple_door_1. Both doors need to be unlocked.

But the agent has to pick up red_ball_4 in room_2. So steps:

But the agent is starting in room_2. Let's plan:

Initial steps:

1. gotoobject red_ball_4 room_2 (precondition: agent is in room_2, which they are)
2. pick red_ball_4 room_2 (now holding it)
3. Then, need to move to room_3. So:

But doors are locked. So need to unlock yellow_door_1 and purple_door_1.

But the agent is holding red_ball_4. So first, unlock yellow_door_1:

4. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_1 (agent in room_2, so possible)
5. toggle yellow_door_1 (unlock)
6. gotoroom room_2 room_1 yellow_door_1 (now in room_1)
7. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_3
8. toggle purple_door_1 (unlock)
9. gotoroom room_1 room_3 purple_door_1 (now in room_3)
10. drop red_ball_4 room_3 (now red_ball_4 is in room_3)

This satisfies constraint 7: whenever the agent is in room_2 (initial state and possibly later steps), then red_ball_4 must be in room_3 at that state or later. Since the agent moves red_ball_4 to room_3 in step 10, any subsequent visits to room_2 (after step 10) would satisfy that. But the initial state is in room_2, and at that time, red_ball_4 is in room_2. So the constraint requires that in the initial state or after, red_ball_4 is moved to room_3. So step 10 must occur after the initial state, which it does.

But in the initial state, the agent is in room_2, and red_ball_4 is in room_2. So the constraint says that in that state (s) or after, red_ball_4 must be in room_3. So the agent must move red_ball_4 to room_3 at some point. So step 10 does that.

But also, the agent must be in room_2 at some state (constraint 6), which is satisfied by the initial state. But if the agent leaves room_2 and never returns, then constraint 6 is satisfied by the initial state. But if the agent returns to room_2 after moving red_ball_4, then that's okay.

Now, the other constraints:

- Constraint 1: At least one state where red_door_1 is locked. The initial state has it locked. So that's covered.

- Constraint 2: If red_door_1 is locked in any state, then in that state or after, the agent is in room_1 or holding grey_ball_1. The initial state has red_door_1 locked, agent in room_2. So in some state after, agent must be in room_1 or hold grey_ball_1. The agent moves to room_1 in step 6. So that's satisfied.

- Constraint 3: Never be in room_4. The plan so far doesn't go there.

- Constraint 10: grey_door_1 must be locked in at least one state. The initial state satisfies this.

- Constraint 11: If grey_door_1 is locked in any state, then in that state or after, the agent is in front of red_ball_4. The initial state has grey_door_1 locked. So the agent must be in front of red_ball_4 at some point. The agent picks up red_ball_4 in step 2, which requires being in front of it. So step 1 (gotoobject red_ball_4) puts the agent in front of it. So step 1 satisfies that. So in the initial state (grey_door_1 locked), the agent is in front of red_ball_4 in step 1, which is after the initial state.

Wait, the initial state is the starting state. Then step 1 is the first action. So the initial state is s0, then actions lead to s1, s2, etc. So constraint 11 says if in any state s, grey_door_1 is locked, then in s or later, agent is in front of red_ball_4. The initial state s0 has grey_door_1 locked, so the agent must be in front of red_ball_4 in s0 or later. In s0, the agent is in room_2 but not in front of anything. So step 1 (gotoobject red_ball_4) is needed to be in front of it in s1. So that satisfies the constraint.

Now, the plan needs to end with the agent in front of grey_door_1 (unlocked). So after moving red_ball_4 to room_3, the agent needs to get to room_3's grey_door_1, unlock it, and be in front of it.

But in the earlier steps, after dropping red_ball_4 in room_3 (step 10), the agent is in room_3. Then:

11. gotoempty (to be in front of empty, but perhaps not necessary)
12. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4
13. toggle grey_door_1 (unlock it)
14. Now, agent is in front of grey_door_1, which is unlocked. So this satisfies the goal.

But before step 12, the agent must have held some object. The agent was holding red_ball_4 until step 10 (drop). Then in room_3, there's purple_ball_1 and yellow_box_1. So maybe pick up one of them.

But the constraint for being in front of grey_door_1 requires that before that state, the agent held some object. So after step 10 (drop red_ball_4), the agent is empty-handed. So need to pick up another object in room_3, like purple_ball_1.

So steps after step 10:

11. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_3
12. pick purple_ball_1 room_3
13. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4
14. toggle grey_door_1 (unlock)
15. Now, the agent is in front of grey_door_1, which is unlocked. This meets the goal.

But this adds more steps. Let's check all constraints again.

Wait, the agent needs to be in front of grey_door_1 (step 13 and 14). Before that, in step 12, the agent picked up purple_ball_1, so they were holding an object. That satisfies constraint 5 (before being in front of grey_door_1, must have held some object).

Also, the toggle in step 14 unlocks grey_door_1. So constraint 8 (grey_door_1 is not locked in some state) is satisfied. The initial state has it locked, step 14 unlocks it.

But after step 14, the agent is in front of grey_door_1, which is unlocked. So that's the goal.

But also, constraint 11 requires that whenever grey_door_1 is locked, the agent is in front of red_ball_4 at that state or later. Since the initial state is locked, step 1 (gotoobject red_ball_4) satisfies that.

Now, the plan so far:

1. gotoobject red_ball_4 room_2
2. pick red_ball_4 room_2
3. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_1
4. toggle yellow_door_1
5. gotoroom room_2 room_1 yellow_door_1
6. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_3
7. toggle purple_door_1
8. gotoroom room_1 room_3 purple_door_1
9. drop red_ball_4 room_3
10. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_3
11. pick purple_ball_1 room_3
12. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4
13. toggle grey_door_1

But wait, after step 9 (drop red_ball_4), the agent is in room_3. Then, they need to go to purple_ball_1 (if it's in room_3). According to the initial state, purple_ball_1 is in room_3. So step 10 is possible.

Then pick it up (step 11). Then go to grey_door_1 (step 12), toggle (step13). So this sequence.

But now, the agent is in room_3, in front of grey_door_1, which is now unlocked. So this meets the goal.

Additionally, check other constraints:

- Constraint 7: agent must be in room_2 at some state. The initial state and steps 1-3 are in room_2. So that's covered.

- Constraint 8: grey_door_1 is not locked in step13.

- Constraint 9: when grey_door_1 is not locked (step13), the agent had held some object (purple_ball_1) before (step11).

- Constraint 10: grey_door_1 is locked in the initial state.

- Constraint 11: in the initial state (grey_door_1 locked), the agent is in front of red_ball_4 in step1.

So all constraints are satisfied.

Now, the problem requires an optimal plan (shortest possible). Let's check if any steps can be eliminated.

Is there a way to avoid picking up purple_ball_1? Because the agent needs to hold an object before being in front of grey_door_1. If after dropping red_ball_4 in room_3 (step9), can the agent pick up another object in room_3? Like yellow_box_1.

Yes. So instead of steps 10-11, the agent could:

10. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_3
11. pick yellow_box_1 room_3
Then proceed to grey_door_1. But that's the same number of steps.

Alternatively, can the agent carry red_ball_4 through, drop it, and use that to fulfill the holding requirement?

Wait, after dropping red_ball_4 (step9), the agent is empty. So need to pick up another object. Thus, steps 10-11 are necessary.

Alternatively, could the agent pick up purple_ball_1 before dropping red_ball_4? But then they would be holding two objects, which isn't possible. No, because you can only carry one at a time.

Alternatively, after step9, the agent is in room_3. They need to go to grey_door_1. To do that, they must first pick up an object. So steps 10-11 are necessary.

So the plan is as above. Let's count the steps:

1. gotoobject red_ball_4 room_2
2. pick red_ball_4
3. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_1
4. toggle yellow_door_1
5. gotoroom room_2 room_1
6. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_3
7. toggle purple_door_1
8. gotoroom room_1 room_3
9. drop red_ball_4
10. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_3
11. pick purple_ball_1
12. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4
13. toggle grey_door_1

That's 13 actions. Is there a shorter way?

Wait, maybe after step5 (agent in room_1), can they go to purple_door_1 without going through gotodoor? But no, they have to go to the door first.

Wait, when in room_1, agent must first goto the door (gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_3), then toggle, then go through. So steps 6-8 are necessary.

Alternative: After picking red_ball_4 in room_2, can the agent go directly to room_3 via a different path? But the only path from room_2 to room_3 is through room_1. So no.

Another possible optimization: After step3 (goto yellow_door_1), toggle it (step4), then go to room_1 (step5). Then, goto purple_door_1 (step6), toggle (step7), then go to room_3 (step8). Then drop red_ball_4 (step9). Then pick up purple_ball_1 (steps 10-11). Then goto grey_door_1 (step12), toggle (step13). Yes, that's the same.

Alternatively, can the agent, after dropping red_ball_4 in room_3 (step9), go directly to grey_door_1 without picking up another object? But the constraint requires that before being in front of grey_door_1, the agent must have held some object. So after dropping red_ball_4, they are not holding anything, so they need to pick up another object. So steps 10-11 are necessary.

So the plan seems optimal. Let me check again for any redundancy.

In room_2, steps 1-3: goto red_ball_4, pick it, then goto yellow_door_1. That's necessary.

In room_1, steps 6-7: goto purple_door_1 and toggle. Then step8 to room_3.

So steps are all necessary.

Therefore, the final plan should be:

```
gotoobject red_ball_4 room_2
pick red_ball_4 room_2
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_1
toggle yellow_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_1 yellow_door_1
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_3
toggle purple_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_3 purple_door_1
drop red_ball_4 room_3
gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_3
pick purple_ball_1 room_3
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4
toggle grey_door_1
```

But wait, after step 13 (toggle grey_door_1), the agent is in front of it and the door is unlocked. So that's the goal.

But the agent is still holding purple_ball_1. Do they need to drop it? The goal doesn't require that. The constraints don't mention anything about not holding objects. So it's okay.

But let me verify the constraints again.

- The agent must be in front of grey_door_1 when it's unlocked. Yes, step13 toggles it to unlocked, and the agent is in front of it.

- Constraint 5: Before being in front of grey_door_1, must have held an object. Yes, they held purple_ball_1.

All other constraints are met. The steps are 13 actions. Can it be shorter?

Another approach: After step9 (drop red_ball_4), can the agent use yellow_box_1 in room_3? Let's see:

9. drop red_ball_4 room_3
10. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_3
11. pick yellow_box_1 room_3
12. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4
13. toggle grey_door_1

Same number of steps.

But is there a shorter path? Suppose the agent doesn't need to move red_ball_4 to room_3. But constraint7 says whenever the agent is in room_2, red_ball_4 must be in room_3 at that state or after. Since the agent starts in room_2 (initial state), they must move red_ball_4 to room_3 at some point. So that step is mandatory.

Another idea: After step5 (agent in room_1), can they pick up red_ball_1 (which is in room_1) and use that for holding when going to grey_door_1? But then they'd need to carry red_ball_1 to room_3, which is possible. Let's see:

Alternative plan:

1. gotoobject red_ball_4 room_2
2. pick red_ball_4
3. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_1
4. toggle yellow_door_1
5. gotoroom room_2 room_1 yellow_door_1
6. drop red_ball_4 room_1 (but then when the agent is in room_2 again, red_ball_4 is in room_1, which doesn't satisfy the constraint that it must be in room_3. So no, this would not work.)

So no, the red_ball_4 must be moved to room_3.

So the original plan seems necessary. Therefore, the steps I listed earlier are the optimal solution.
