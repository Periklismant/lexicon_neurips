Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. The goal is to have a purple ball in room_4, be in room_4, and be in front of that ball. There are several constraints to satisfy, so I need to break this down step by step.

First, the initial state: I'm in room_2. The purple_ball_1 is already in room_4, so that's good. But I need to end up in front of it in room_4. The problem is the doors are all locked initially. Blue doors 1, 2, 3, and green_door_1 are all locked. The constraints include needing to be in front of green_door_1 at some point, and ensuring blue_door_3 stays locked. Also, when in room_4, I must have previously been in room_1 or holding the purple_ball_1. Plus, other constraints like when in room_2, I must be holding something at that state or after.

Hmm. Let's see. To get to room_4 from room_2, the door is blue_door_3, but that's locked and must remain locked. So that path is blocked. So maybe I need to go through other rooms. Let's see the connections. From room_2, I can go to room_1 via blue_door_1, which is locked. Or room_4 via blue_door_3, but locked. So first, I need to unlock doors. Wait, but the toggle action can unlock a door if I'm in front of it. But to get in front of a door, I need to be in a room connected by that door. For example, blue_door_1 connects room_1 and room_2. Since I'm in room_2, I can go to blue_door_1, but is there an object blocking it? The initial state says that room_2 has grey_box_2 and grey_box_3. Are they blocking the door? The problem description mentions that "there is no object blocking the position in front of d in the room you are currently in" as a precondition for gotodoor. Wait, the initial state doesn't mention any objects blocking doors, so maybe they are not. So maybe I can go to blue_door_1 from room_2. Let's check.

So, first step: gotoempty in room_2 to move to an empty position, but maybe that's not necessary. Wait, the preconditions for gotodoor: I can go to a door d if I'm in a room connected by d, and no object is blocking the position in front of d. So if the door's position isn't blocked, I can go there. Since initial state doesn't mention any objects blocking doors, maybe I can assume they're not blocked. So let's try.

So from room_2, I can do gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1. Then toggle it to unlock. Wait, but blue_door_1 is locked initially. So I can unlock it. Then I can go to room_1. Then from room_1, maybe go to blue_door_2 which connects to room_3. Unlock that, then go to room_3. From room_3, go to green_door_1 to room_4, unlock it, then go to room_4. Then, once in room_4, go to purple_ball_1 and be in front of it.

But let's check the constraints:

- Must be in front of green_door_1 at some state. So when I'm in room_3 or room_4, I can go to green_door_1. For example, from room_3, gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4. Then toggle it if needed. That would satisfy the constraint of being in front of green_door_1.

Another constraint: If in room_4, must have been in room_1 or holding purple_ball_1 before. Since the purple_ball_1 is already in room_4, maybe entering room_4 via green_door_1 from room_3 would require that prior condition. But how? To get to room_3, I might have gone through room_1, which would satisfy the "you are in room_1" part. So that would satisfy the condition if I pass through room_1 before getting to room_4.

Another constraint: Every state must have blue_door_3 locked. So I can never unlock blue_door_3. Therefore, the only way to room_4 is through green_door_1 from room_3, which requires unlocking green_door_1. But since green_door_1 is initially locked, I need to unlock it. So the path would be: room_2 -> room_1 via blue_door_1 (unlock), then room_1 -> room_3 via blue_door_2 (unlock), then room_3 -> room_4 via green_door_1 (unlock). Then, in room_4, gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4.

But wait, the initial state says that all doors are locked. So each door must be toggled. Let's outline the steps:

1. From room_2, go to blue_door_1 (gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1). Then toggle it to unlock. Now blue_door_1 is unlocked.

2. Then, gotoroom room_2 room_1 blue_door_1. Now in room_1.

3. From room_1, go to blue_door_2 (gotodoor blue_door_2 room_1 room_3). Toggle to unlock.

4. Gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_2. Now in room_3.

5. In room_3, go to green_door_1 (gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4). Toggle to unlock.

6. Gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_1. Now in room_4.

7. In room_4, gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4. Then, done.

But wait, the goal is to be in front of the purple_ball_1 in room_4, and the agent is in room_4. So step 7 would achieve that. But need to check the constraints:

- Constraint 1: Must be in front of green_door_1 at least once. That happens in step 5 when we goto green_door_1 in room_3.

- Constraint 2: Must be in room_4. That's achieved in step 6.

- Constraint 3: If in room_4, then earlier state was in room_1 or holding purple_ball_1. Since we went through room_1 (step 2), that's satisfied.

- Constraint 4: blue_door_3 remains locked. Our plan doesn't touch blue_door_3, so that's okay.

- Constraint 5: Must be in front of purple_ball_1. Step 7.

- Constraint 6: If in front of purple_ball_1 (step 7), then earlier state must have held some object or blue_door_2 was unlocked. Blue_door_2 was unlocked in step 3, so that's satisfied.

- Constraint 7: At least once, holding some object or holding purple_ball_1. The plan as outlined doesn't involve picking up any objects. So this might be a problem. The constraint requires that in some state, the agent is holding something. But in the current plan, the agent never picks anything up. So this constraint isn't met. Therefore, the plan needs to include picking up an object.

Ah, right. So the seventh constraint is that at some point, the agent must be holding an object or the purple_ball_1. But in the current plan, the agent never holds anything, so that's a problem. So how to satisfy this?

Also, another constraint: If in room_2 in any state, then in that state or a later one, the agent is holding something. The initial state is in room_2, and the first action is gotodoor. So unless the agent picks up something while in room_2, the initial state being in room_2 would require that at some point after, the agent holds something. Since the agent starts in room_2, and leaves room_2 early on, but the constraint says that any state where the agent is in room_2 must have the agent holding something either at that state or after. So if the agent is ever in room_2 again, they need to hold something. But the initial plan only starts in room_2 and leaves. So the initial state is in room_2, but the agent isn't holding anything. So the constraint requires that in the initial state or after, the agent holds something. Wait, the constraint is: If "you are in room_2" holds in some state s, then "you are holding some object" must hold at s or after. So the initial state is in room_2, and the agent is not holding anything. Therefore, the agent must pick up something in room_2 before leaving, or later. But in the current plan, the agent leaves room_2 in step 2 (gotoroom to room_1). So after leaving room_2, the agent is in room_1. So the initial state is room_2, so the agent must hold something in room_2 (before leaving) or at some later state. So if the agent doesn't pick up anything in room_2, then after leaving, they must hold something later. But in the current plan, they don't hold anything. Therefore, to satisfy this constraint, the agent must pick up an object at some point.

So combining both constraints: the agent must hold some object at least once (constraint 7) and also satisfy the room_2 constraint. So perhaps the agent needs to pick up an object in room_2, then drop it later. Let's see.

In room_2, there are grey_box_2 and grey_box_3. So the agent could pick one of them. Let's adjust the plan:

1. In room_2, gotoobject grey_box_2 room_2.

2. pick grey_box_2 room_2.

Then proceed to the door steps. But this adds steps. Also, the agent needs to carry the box, but perhaps dropping it later. However, the goal is to be in room_4 in front of the purple_ball_1, which is already there. So maybe the agent can carry the box through the doors. Let's see:

But when the agent picks up an object, they are holding it, which would satisfy constraint 7 and the room_2 constraint. So let's add:

Step 0: gotoobject grey_box_2 room_2.

Step 1: pick grey_box_2 room_2. Now holding it.

Then proceed to gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1.

But when moving to another room, the agent can carry the object. However, when the agent uses gotoroom, they can carry the object. So after picking up the box, the agent can go through the doors. Then, perhaps drop it somewhere.

But let's see if this works with the constraints:

By picking up grey_box_2 in room_2, the agent satisfies the room_2 constraint (since in room_2, they are holding an object). Also, constraint 7 is satisfied because they are holding an object. Then, they can proceed to unlock doors while carrying the box.

But when moving through doors, they can carry the box. So let's adjust the plan:

0. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1.

Wait, no. First, after picking up the box, the agent is in front of it, but to go to the door, they need to goto the door. So steps:

1. gotoobject grey_box_2 room_2.

2. pick grey_box_2 room_2.

3. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1.

4. toggle blue_door_1.

5. gotoroom room_2 room_1 blue_door_1. Now in room_1, holding grey_box_2.

6. gotodoor blue_door_2 room_1 room_3.

7. toggle blue_door_2.

8. gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_2. Now in room_3, still holding the box.

9. gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4.

10. toggle green_door_1.

11. gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_1. Now in room_4, holding the box.

12. drop grey_box_2 room_4.

13. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4.

But this plan is longer. Also, after dropping the box in room_4, the agent can then go to the ball. But does this satisfy all constraints?

Check constraints:

- Constraint 3: When in room_4 (step 11), earlier state must be in room_1 or holding purple_ball_1. We were in room_1 (step 5) and room_3, so that's satisfied.

- Constraint 5: In front of purple_ball_1 (step 13).

- Constraint 6: When in front of purple_ball_1 (step 13), earlier state must have held an object (steps 2-11) or blue_door_2 was unlocked. Since we held the box, that's satisfied.

- Constraint 7: Held an object (steps 2-12).

- Constraint 8: At some state, green_door_1 is unlocked and agent is in room_1. Wait, the constraint says "green_door_1 is not locked" and "you are in room_1" must hold in the same state. But in the current plan, green_door_1 is toggled in step 10 (room_3), so after that, green_door_1 is unlocked. But the agent is in room_3. Then when going to room_4. So the agent is never in room_1 and green_door_1 is unlocked. Therefore, this violates constraint 8.

Ah, right. The eighth constraint requires that in some state, both green_door_1 is unlocked and the agent is in room_1. How can that happen?

Wait, green_door_1 connects room_3 and room_4. So if the agent is in room_1, how can green_door_1 be unlocked? Unless the agent unlocks green_door_1 while in room_3, but then being in room_1 and green_door_1 unlocked is not possible unless the agent goes back to room_1 after unlocking green_door_1. But that complicates the plan.

This is a problem. The constraint requires that there's a state where green_door_1 is not locked and the agent is in room_1. But green_door_1 is in rooms 3 and 4. So to have the agent in room_1 and green_door_1 unlocked, the agent must have unlocked green_door_1 and then returned to room_1. But how? Let's think.

The agent starts in room_2, goes to room_1, then to room_3, unlocks green_door_1 (in room_3), then goes to room_4. But to get back to room_1 from room_3, the agent would need to go through blue_door_2 again. But that's already unlocked. So after unlocking green_door_1, the agent could go back to room_3 -> room_1, then be in room_1 with green_door_1 unlocked. But then, that would require additional steps.

So modifying the plan:

After step 10 (unlock green_door_1 in room_3), instead of proceeding to room_4, the agent could go back to room_1.

But how?

After step 10: in room_3, in front of green_door_1. Then:

10a. gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_2. (Since blue_door_2 is unlocked.)

But wait, the agent is holding the grey_box_2. So they can move back to room_1.

So steps:

10. toggle green_door_1. Now it's unlocked.

11. gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_2. Now in room_1, holding the box. At this point, green_door_1 is unlocked and the agent is in room_1. So this satisfies constraint 8.

12. Now, need to go back to room_3 and proceed to room_4.

12. gotodoor blue_door_2 room_1 room_3.

13. gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_2.

14. gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4.

15. gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_1.

16. drop grey_box_2 room_4.

17. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4.

But this adds more steps. However, it's necessary to satisfy constraint 8.

So the plan would include:

- Unlock green_door_1.

- Go back to room_1 to satisfy constraint 8.

- Then proceed to room_4.

But now, the agent is in room_1 after unlocking green_door_1. So at that state, green_door_1 is unlocked (since we toggled it in step 10) and the agent is in room_1. So constraint 8 is satisfied.

But now, the plan is getting longer, but necessary.

Additionally, the agent is holding the grey_box_2 from room_2 until they drop it in room_4. This satisfies the room_2 constraint because when the agent was in room_2 initially, they picked up the box (step 1 and 2), so they were holding it, which satisfies the constraint that if in room_2, they must hold something then or later. Since they left room_2 while holding the box, that's okay.

Now, check all constraints again:

- Constraint 1: In front of green_door_1. Step 9 (gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4).

- Constraint 2: In room_4. Step 15.

- Constraint 3: When in room_4 (step 15), earlier state was in room_1 (step 11) or holding purple_ball_1. We were in room_1 (step 11), so satisfied.

- Constraint 4: blue_door_3 remains locked. Our plan never touches blue_door_3, so yes.

- Constraint 5: In front of purple_ball_1. Step 17.

- Constraint 6: When in front of purple_ball_1 (step 17), earlier state had holding an object (steps 2-16) or blue_door_2 unlocked (step 7). Both are true.

- Constraint 7: At least once holding an object. Steps 2-16.

- Constraint 8: green_door_1 unlocked and in room_1. Step 11, after returning to room_1 with green_door_1 unlocked.

- Constraint 9: Must be in room_2 at some state. The initial state is room_2, so that's satisfied.

- Constraint 10: If in room_2 (which is only in the initial state and possibly step 0), then in that state or after, hold something. Since in the initial state, agent is in room_2 but not holding anything. But after step 2, agent is holding the box, so the constraint is satisfied because after the initial state (which is room_2), the agent leaves but in the same state, they picked up the box. Wait, the initial state is room_2, then the first action is gotoobject grey_box_2 room_2. Then pick it up. So during the initial state, they are in room_2 and not holding anything. Then step 0: gotoobject. Step 1: pick. So after step 1, they are holding the box. So the initial state (s0) is room_2 and not holding. Then action 0: gotoobject. Then action 1: pick. So in state s1, they are in room_2, holding the box. So the constraint requires that if in room_2 (s0), then in s0 or later, hold something. Since in s1 (which is after s0), they are holding something, so that's satisfied.

Yes, this works.

Now, putting all the steps together:

1. gotoobject grey_box_2 room_2

2. pick grey_box_2 room_2

3. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1

4. toggle blue_door_1

5. gotoroom room_2 room_1 blue_door_1

6. gotodoor blue_door_2 room_1 room_3

7. toggle blue_door_2

8. gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_2

9. gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4

10. toggle green_door_1

11. gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_2

12. gotodoor blue_door_2 room_1 room_3

13. gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_2

14. gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4

15. gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_1

16. drop grey_box_2 room_4

17. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4

But wait, after step 11, the agent is back in room_1. Then step 12: gotodoor blue_door_2 again? Let's check:

After step 11: agent is in room_1. To go back to room_3, they need to use blue_door_2 again.

Step 12: gotodoor blue_door_2 room_1 room_3 (since blue_door_2 connects room_1 and room_3). Then step 13: gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_2.

Then step 14: gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4. Then step 15: gotoroom to room_4. Then drop the box, and goto the ball.

This seems correct. But this plan is quite long, and perhaps there's a shorter way. Let's think: after step 10 (unlocking green_door_1), instead of going back to room_1, can we find another way to satisfy constraint 8 (green_door_1 unlocked and in room_1)?

But the agent is in room_3 after step 10. To get back to room_1, they need to go through blue_door_2 again. So steps 11-13 are necessary. But is there a way to avoid this backtracking?

Alternatively, after unlocking green_door_1, can the agent go to room_4, then back to room_3, then to room_1? But that would require going through green_door_1 again. Let me see:

If after step 10 (unlock green_door_1), the agent proceeds to room_4 (step 11: gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_1). Then in room_4, can they drop the box (step 12: drop). Then go back to room_3 via green_door_1 (step 13: gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1). Then go to room_1 via blue_door_2 (step 14: gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_2). Now, in room_1, green_door_1 is unlocked, so constraint 8 is satisfied. Then proceed back to room_3 and room_4 again. But this would add even more steps.

Alternatively, maybe after unlocking green_door_1 and being in room_3, the agent can go to room_1 via blue_door_2, which is unlocked. So:

After step 10 (toggle green_door_1):

11. gotodoor blue_door_2 room_3 room_1 (Wait, blue_door_2 connects room_1 and room_3. So from room_3, gotodoor blue_door_2 room_3 room_1.

But wait, the gotodoor action is "gotodoor d r1 r2" where you are in a room connected by d. So in room_3, the door blue_door_2 connects to room_1. So gotodoor blue_door_2 room_3 room_1. Then gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_2. That would take the agent back to room_1. Now, in room_1, green_door_1 is unlocked (since we toggled it in step 10), so the agent is in room_1 and green_door_1 is unlocked. So this satisfies constraint 8. Then, proceed back to room_3 and go to room_4. So steps:

10. toggle green_door_1 (unlocked)

11. gotodoor blue_door_2 room_3 room_1

12. gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_2

Now in room_1 again. Then, go back to room_3:

13. gotodoor blue_door_2 room_1 room_3

14. gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_2

15. gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4

16. gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_1

17. drop grey_box_2 room_4

18. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4

This way, step 12 (room_1) satisfies constraint 8. This approach may save a step compared to the previous version. Let's count:

Original steps after step 10:

11. gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_2 (step 11)

12. gotodoor blue_door_2 room_1 room_3 (step 12)

13. gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_2 (step 13)

14. gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4 (step 14)

15. gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_1 (step 15)

16. drop (step 16)

17. gotoobject (step 17)

Total steps from 10: 7 steps.

In the alternative approach:

After step 10:

11. gotodoor blue_door_2 room_3 room_1 (step 11)

12. gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_2 (step 12) → now in room_1, which with green_door_1 unlocked.

13. gotodoor blue_door_2 room_1 room_3 (step 13)

14. gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_2 (step 14)

15. gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4 (step 15)

16. gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_1 (step 16)

17. drop grey_box_2 room_4 (step 17)

18. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4 (step 18)

So same number of steps. But maybe the order is different. But in any case, this satisfies all constraints.

But this makes the plan longer. Is there a shorter way? Let's think.

Alternatively, after picking up the box in room_2, go to room_1, unlock blue_door_2, go to room_3, unlock green_door_1, then return to room_1 to satisfy the constraint, then go back to room_3 and proceed to room_4. That's necessary.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a way to avoid carrying the box, but the constraints require that the agent holds something at least once. Also, the room_2 constraint requires that after being in room_2, the agent holds something. So they must pick up the box in room_2.

But maybe there's a shorter path. For example:

1. gotoobject grey_box_2 room_2.

2. pick grey_box_2 room_2.

3. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1.

4. toggle blue_door_1.

5. gotoroom room_2 room_1 blue_door_1.

6. gotodoor blue_door_2 room_1 room_3.

7. toggle blue_door_2.

8. gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_2.

9. gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4.

10. toggle green_door_1.

11. gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_2. → Wait, from room_3, can't go back to room_1 via blue_door_2 directly. So step 11 would be gotodoor blue_door_2 room_3 room_1.

12. toggle blue_door_2 (already unlocked, but toggling would lock it again. But that's a problem because we need to use it again. So we can't toggle it again. Hmm. So after step 10, the agent is in room_3, in front of green_door_1. To go back to room_1, they need to use blue_door_2 again, which is already unlocked. So steps:

11. gotodoor blue_door_2 room_3 room_1.

12. gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_2. → Now in room_1, with green_door_1 unlocked. This satisfies constraint 8.

13. gotodoor blue_door_2 room_1 room_3.

14. gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_2.

15. gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4.

16. gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_1.

17. drop grey_box_2 room_4.

18. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4.

This way, steps 11-14 are needed to go back and forth. So the total steps are 18. This seems lengthy, but necessary to meet all constraints.

Another thing to check: when the agent is in room_4, they drop the box, which requires being in front of an empty position. So after dropping, they can go to the ball.

But when they drop the box, they are in front of it. So step 17: drop grey_box_2 room_4. Then, to gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4, they need to move away from the box. So after dropping, they need to gotoempty or goto another object. But the purple_ball_1 is in room_4. So:

After step 16: agent is in room_4.

17. drop grey_box_2 room_4. Now in front of grey_box_2.

18. gotoempty (to move away).

19. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4.

But this adds more steps. Wait, the 'drop' action's effect is that you are in front of the object you dropped. So after dropping, you're in front of it. To go to the ball, you need to gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4, which requires being in the same room. So step 18: gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4. Which is possible because you're in room_4. So step 17: drop, step 18: gotoobject. So that's two steps. Thus, the plan becomes 18 steps.

But this is getting very long. Let's confirm the preconditions:

- To pick up an object, you must be in the same room and not holding anything.

- To drop, you must be holding the object and the position in front is empty.

Wait, the 'drop' action requires that the position in front is empty. But when you drop, you are in front of the object. So when you drop, the effect is that the object is placed in front of you. Wait, the 'drop' effect says: (iv) object x is situated in the room you are currently in. So when you drop x, you are in front of x. So after dropping, you are in front of x, which is now in the room.

So to go to the ball, you need to move away from the box you dropped. So after dropping, you can't immediately goto the ball, unless there's another object. But the ball is present in room_4, so you can gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4. But you need to be in the same room, which you are. So step after drop would be gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4. Which is allowed.

But the 'gotoobject' action requires that you are in the same room as the object. Since you are in room_4, and the ball is there, this is okay. So you can go from being in front of the box to the ball. So steps:

17. drop grey_box_2 room_4 → now in front of grey_box_2.

18. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4 → move to the ball.

This works. So the plan would have these steps.

Now, checking all constraints again:

- Constraint 8: In step 12, the agent is in room_1, and green_door_1 is unlocked (since step 10 toggled it). So yes.

- All other constraints are met as previously analyzed.

This seems to satisfy all constraints. Now, the plan is as follows:

```
gotoobject grey_box_2 room_2
pick grey_box_2 room_2
gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1
toggle blue_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_1 blue_door_1
gotodoor blue_door_2 room_1 room_3
toggle blue_door_2
gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_2
gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4
toggle green_door_1
gotodoor blue_door_2 room_3 room_1
gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_2
gotodoor blue_door_2 room_1 room_3
gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_2
gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4
gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_1
drop grey_box_2 room_4
gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4
```

Wait, but after step 10 (toggle green_door_1), step 11 is gotodoor blue_door_2 room_3 room_1. Then step 12: gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_2. Then step 13: gotodoor blue_door_2 room_1 room_3. Step 14: gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_2. Then step 15: gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4. Step 16: gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_1. Step 17: drop. Step 18: gotoobject.

But let's count the steps:

1. gotoobject grey_box_2 room_2

2. pick

3. gotodoor blue_door_1

4. toggle

5. gotoroom to room_1

6. gotodoor blue_door_2

7. toggle

8. gotoroom to room_3

9. gotodoor green_door_1

10. toggle

11. gotodoor blue_door_2 (room_3 to room_1)

12. gotoroom to room_1

13. gotodoor blue_door_2 again (room_1 to room_3)

14. gotoroom to room_3

15. gotodoor green_door_1

16. gotoroom to room_4

17. drop

18. gotoobject

So 18 steps. This seems correct.

Now, verify that this is the minimal steps. Is there a way to shorten it? For example, can the agent avoid going back to room_1 after unlocking green_door_1? The constraint 8 requires that at some state, the agent is in room_1 and green_door_1 is unlocked. So the agent must be in room_1 after green_door_1 is unlocked. Hence, the backtracking is necessary. Therefore, this seems unavoidable.

Therefore, this plan should work and satisfy all constraints.
