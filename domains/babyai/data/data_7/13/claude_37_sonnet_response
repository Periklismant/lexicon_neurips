Alright, let's break down the planning problem step by step.

First, let me understand the state transitions and then think about how to satisfy all the constraints.

The initial state is:
- I am in room_2
- grey_box_1 is in room_1
- grey_box_2 and grey_box_3 are in room_2
- purple_box_1, green_ball_1, and grey_box_4 are in room_3
- purple_ball_1 and green_box_1 are in room_4
- All doors (blue_door_1, blue_door_2, blue_door_3, green_door_1) are locked
- I am not holding any object
- I have visited room_2

The goal is to have a purple ball (which must be purple_ball_1 as there's only one purple ball in the world) in room_4, and I need to be in room_4 in front of the ball.

Now let's consider the constraints:

1. I need to be in front of green_door_1 at some point.
2. I need to be in room_4 at some point.
3. If I am in room_4, I must have been in room_1 or have been holding purple_ball_1 earlier.
4. blue_door_3 must always be locked.
5. I need to be in front of purple_ball_1 at some point.
6. Before I can be in front of purple_ball_1, I must either be holding some object or blue_door_2 must be unlocked.
7. I need to be holding either purple_ball_1 or some other object at some point.
8. At some point, green_door_1 must be unlocked and I must be in room_1.
9. I need to be in room_2 at some point (this is satisfied in the initial state).
10. If I am in room_2, I must hold some object at that state or at a later state.

Now, let's think about a plan:

Given constraint 3 and the fact that purple_ball_1 is in room_4, and constraint 4 which says blue_door_3 must always be locked, I need to reach room_4 either via green_door_1 from room_3 or via blue_door_3 from room_2. But since blue_door_3 must always be locked (constraint 4), I can only reach room_4 via green_door_1 from room_3.

Constraint 3 also says I need to either be in room_1 or be holding purple_ball_1 before I can be in room_4. 

Given constraint 8, at some point I need to be in room_1 and green_door_1 must be unlocked.

Constraint 6 says before I can be in front of purple_ball_1, I must either be holding some object or blue_door_2 must be unlocked.

Let's think of a strategy:

1. From room_2, I need to go to room_1 via blue_door_1, but it's locked, so I need to unlock it first.
2. Once in room_1, I need to unlock blue_door_2 to go to room_3.
3. From room_3, I need to unlock green_door_1 to go to room_4.
4. I need to also unlock green_door_1 while in room_1 at some point (constraint 8), but I can't do that as I'm not in front of it. This means I need to be in room_1 and green_door_1 must be unlocked at the same time, not that I need to unlock it from room_1.
5. Once in room_4, I need to go in front of purple_ball_1 and pick it up (to satisfy constraint 7).
6. Then, I need to drop purple_ball_1 in room_4 and go in front of it to satisfy the goal.

But there's a problem with constraint 6: Before I can be in front of purple_ball_1, I must either be holding some object or blue_door_2 must be unlocked. Since purple_ball_1 is in room_4, and blue_door_2 is between room_1 and room_3, I can only be in front of purple_ball_1 if I've already unlocked blue_door_2.

Constraint 10 says if I am in room_2, I must hold some object at that state or at a later state. I am in room_2 in the initial state, so I must hold some object at some point. There are grey_box_2 and grey_box_3 in room_2, so I could pick one of them.

Let's refine the plan:

1. From room_2, I'll go in front of grey_box_2 and pick it up to satisfy constraint 10.
2. Go in front of blue_door_1 and toggle it to unlock it.
3. Go to room_1 via blue_door_1.
4. Go in front of blue_door_2 and toggle it to unlock it.
5. Go to room_3 via blue_door_2.
6. Go in front of green_door_1 and toggle it to unlock it.
7. Go to room_4 via green_door_1 (now I've satisfied constraint 2).
8. Go in front of purple_ball_1 (satisfying constraint 5).
9. Drop grey_box_2 to free my hands.
10. Pick up purple_ball_1 (satisfying constraint 7).
11. Drop purple_ball_1 (to ensure it's in room_4).
12. Go in front of purple_ball_1 to satisfy the goal.

But wait, I need to double-check constraint 8: "At some point, green_door_1 must be unlocked and I must be in room_1." This is a problem because green_door_1 is between room_3 and room_4, so I can't be in room_1 when green_door_1 is unlocked. This constraint seems contradictory.

Actually, let me reconsider the constraint. It doesn't say I need to unlock green_door_1 while in room_1. It just says there should be a state where green_door_1 is unlocked and I am in room_1. 

So I need to modify my plan. I need to somehow unlock green_door_1 and then return to room_1. Here's a refined plan:

1. From room_2, I'll go in front of grey_box_2 and pick it up to satisfy constraint 10.
2. Go in front of blue_door_1 and toggle it to unlock it.
3. Go to room_1 via blue_door_1.
4. Go in front of blue_door_2 and toggle it to unlock it.
5. Go to room_3 via blue_door_2.
6. Go in front of green_door_1 and toggle it to unlock it.
7. Go back to room_1 via blue_door_2 (satisfying constraint 8: green_door_1 is unlocked and I am in room_1).
8. Go back to room_3 via blue_door_2.
9. Go to room_4 via green_door_1 (now I've satisfied constraint 2).
10. Go in front of purple_ball_1 (satisfying constraint 5).
11. Drop grey_box_2 to free my hands.
12. Pick up purple_ball_1 (satisfying constraint 7).
13. Drop purple_ball_1 (to ensure it's in room_4).
14. Go in front of purple_ball_1 to satisfy the goal.

Hmm, but constraint 3 says if I am in room_4, I must have been in room_1 or have been holding purple_ball_1 earlier. I am in room_1 at step 7, but then I go to room_4 at step 9. So, this constraint is satisfied.

Let's translate this plan to the format required:

```
gotoobject grey_box_2 room_2
pick grey_box_2 room_2
gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1
toggle blue_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_1 blue_door_1
gotodoor blue_door_2 room_1 room_3
toggle blue_door_2
gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_2
gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4
toggle green_door_1
gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_2
gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_2
gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_1
gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4
gotoempty
drop grey_box_2 room_4
gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4
pick purple_ball_1 room_4
gotoempty
drop purple_ball_1 room_4
gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4
```

Wait, I think I made a mistake. After step 10 (going in front of purple_ball_1), I need to drop grey_box_2, but I need to go to an empty position first. Let me revise the plan:

```
gotoobject grey_box_2 room_2
pick grey_box_2 room_2
gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1
toggle blue_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_1 blue_door_1
gotodoor blue_door_2 room_1 room_3
toggle blue_door_2
gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_2
gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4
toggle green_door_1
gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_2
gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_2
gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_1
gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4
gotoempty
drop grey_box_2 room_4
gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4
pick purple_ball_1 room_4
gotoempty
drop purple_ball_1 room_4
gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4
```

Actually, let me double-check again:

Constraint 6 says before I can be in front of purple_ball_1, I must either be holding some object or blue_door_2 must be unlocked. In my plan, blue_door_2 is unlocked before I go in front of purple_ball_1, so this constraint is satisfied.

But let me also double-check constraint 1: "I need to be in front of green_door_1 at some point." In my plan, I go in front of green_door_1 at step 9 to toggle it, so this constraint is satisfied.

But wait, I just realized there's a more direct way to reach room_4 given the initial state. Since blue_door_3 connects room_2 and room_4, and I start in room_2, I can potentially reach room_4 by just toggling blue_door_3. But constraint 4 forbids unlocking blue_door_3, so I can't use that route.

I guess my plan is correct. Let me triple check:

Constraint 3 says if I am in room_4, I must have been in room_1 or have been holding purple_ball_1 earlier. In my plan, I am in room_1 at step 5 and room_4 at step 13, so this constraint is satisfied.

Constraint 6 says before I can be in front of purple_ball_1, I must either be holding some object or blue_door_2 must be unlocked. In my plan, blue_door_2 is unlocked at step 7, and I go in front of purple_ball_1 at step 14, so this constraint is satisfied.

Constraint 8 says there should be a state where green_door_1 is unlocked and I am in room_1. In my plan, green_door_1 is unlocked at step 10, and I am in room_1 at step 11, so this constraint is satisfied.

Wait, I realize I'm overthinking this. Let me just systematically check all constraints against my plan:

1. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: you are in front of green_door_1": In my plan, I go in front of green_door_1 at step 9 to toggle it, so this constraint is satisfied.

2. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: you are in room_4": In my plan, I go to room_4 at step 13, so this constraint is satisfied.

3. "If expression you are in room_4 holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: 'At least one of the following conditions is true: you are in room_1, you are holding purple_ball_1'": In my plan, I am in room_1 at step 5 (and also at step 11) before I go to room_4 at step 13, so this constraint is satisfied.

4. "The following expression must hold in every state: blue_door_3 is locked": In my plan, I never toggle blue_door_3, so it remains locked throughout, and this constraint is satisfied.

5. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: you are in front of purple_ball_1": In my plan, I go in front of purple_ball_1 at step 14 (and also at steps 17 and 21), so this constraint is satisfied.

6. "If expression you are in front of purple_ball_1 holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: 'At least one of the following conditions is true: you are holding some object, blue_door_2 is not locked'": In my plan, blue_door_2 is unlocked at step 7, and I am holding grey_box_2 from step 2 to step 16, before I go in front of purple_ball_1 at step 14, so this constraint is satisfied.

7. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'At least one of the following conditions is true: you are holding purple_ball_1, you are holding some object'": In my plan, I am holding grey_box_2 from step 2 to step 16, and purple_ball_1 from step 18 to step 20, so this constraint is satisfied.

8. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'The following conditions are all true: green_door_1 is not locked, you are in room_1'": In my plan, green_door_1 is unlocked at step 10, and I am in room_1 at step 11, so this constraint is satisfied.

9. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: you are in room_2": I start in room_2 in the initial state, so this constraint is satisfied.

10. "If expression you are in room_2 holds in some state s, then expression you are holding some object must hold at s or at some state after s": I am in room_2 in the initial state and also at steps 1-4, and I am holding grey_box_2 from step 2 to step 16, which is after I am in room_2, so this constraint is satisfied.

It seems like my plan satisfies all the constraints and achieves the goal. Let's go with this plan, which I've verified is correct:

```
gotoobject grey_box_2 room_2
pick grey_box_2 room_2
gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1
toggle blue_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_1 blue_door_1
gotodoor blue_door_2 room_1 room_3
toggle blue_door_2
gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_2
gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4
toggle green_door_1
gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_2
gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_2
gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_1
gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4
gotoempty
drop grey_box_2 room_4
gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4
pick purple_ball_1 room_4
gotoempty
drop purple_ball_1 room_4
gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4
```

Hmm, let me double check the transition rules to make sure I can perform these actions in the given order.

Actually, I realized I don't need to drop grey_box_2 and pick up and drop purple_ball_1 to fulfill the goal. The goal only requires me to be in room_4 in front of purple_ball_1, and purple_ball_1 should be in room_4, which it already is in the initial state.

But, I need to be holding something if I am in room_2 (constraint 10), and I need to be holding purple_ball_1 or some object at some point (constraint 7). So, I guess I do need to pick up grey_box_2.

But, at the end, the goal is "There is a ball v such that "The following conditions are all true: "v is purple", "v is in room_4", "you are in room_4", "you are in front of v""". This doesn't require me to be holding the ball; it just requires me to be in room_4 in front of the ball.

So, the steps where I drop grey_box_2 might not be necessary for the goal, but I need to drop it to pick up purple_ball_1 (to satisfy constraint 7). And then I need to drop purple_ball_1 to satisfy the goal.

Actually, the preconditions for the pick action say I can only pick up an object if I am not holding any object. So, I do need to drop grey_box_2 before I can pick up purple_ball_1.

Let's trace through the plan again to ensure it's valid:

1. gotoobject grey_box_2 room_2: I'm in room_2, grey_box_2 is in room_2, so I can go in front of it.
2. pick grey_box_2 room_2: I'm in front of grey_box_2, I'm not holding any object, so I can pick it up.
3. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1: I'm in room_2, blue_door_1 connects room_2 and room_1, so I can go in front of it.
4. toggle blue_door_1: I'm in front of blue_door_1, so I can toggle it, unlocking it.
5. gotoroom room_2 room_1 blue_door_1: I'm in room_2, blue_door_1 connects room_2 and room_1, blue_door_1 is unlocked, so I can go to room_1.
6. gotodoor blue_door_2 room_1 room_3: I'm in room_1, blue_door_2 connects room_1 and room_3, so I can go in front of it.
7. toggle blue_door_2: I'm in front of blue_door_2, so I can toggle it, unlocking it.
8. gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_2: I'm in room_1, blue_door_2 connects room_1 and room_3, blue_door_2 is unlocked, so I can go to room_3.
9. gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4: I'm in room_3, green_door_1 connects room_3 and room_4, so I can go in front of it.
10. toggle green_door_1: I'm in front of green_door_1, so I can toggle it, unlocking it.
11. gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_2: I'm in room_3, blue_door_2 connects room_3 and room_1, blue_door_2 is unlocked, so I can go to room_1.
12. gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_2: I'm in room_1, blue_door_2 connects room_1 and room_3, blue_door_2 is unlocked, so I can go to room_3.
13. gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_1: I'm in room_3, green_door_1 connects room_3 and room_4, green_door_1 is unlocked, so I can go to room_4.
14. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4: I'm in room_4, purple_ball_1 is in room_4, so I can go in front of it.
15. gotoempty: I can go in front of an empty position anytime.
16. drop grey_box_2 room_4: I'm holding grey_box_2, the position in front of me is empty, so I can drop it.
17. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4: I'm in room_4, purple_ball_1 is in room_4, so I can go in front of it.
18. pick purple_ball_1 room_4: I'm in front of purple_ball_1, I'm not holding any object, so I can pick it up.
19. gotoempty: I can go in front of an empty position anytime.
20. drop purple_ball_1 room_4: I'm holding purple_ball_1, the position in front of me is empty, so I can drop it.
21. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4: I'm in room_4, purple_ball_1 is in room_4, so I can go in front of it.

Wait, I notice that step 11 (going back to room_1) and step 12 (going back to room_3) seem to be unnecessary. Let's drop them and see if our plan still satisfies all the constraints.

Let's check constraint 8 again: "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'The following conditions are all true: green_door_1 is not locked, you are in room_1'". 

If we drop steps 11 and 12, we'll never have a state where green_door_1 is unlocked and I am in room_1, because by the time I unlock green_door_1 at step 10, I'm in room_3. So, I do need to go back to room_1 before going to room_4.

So, my plan is correct as is:

```
gotoobject grey_box_2 room_2
pick grey_box_2 room_2
gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1
toggle blue_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_1 blue_door_1
gotodoor blue_door_2 room_1 room_3
toggle blue_door_2
gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_2
gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4
toggle green_door_1
gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_2
gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_2
gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_1
gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4
gotoempty
drop grey_box_2 room_4
gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4
pick purple_ball_1 room_4
gotoempty
drop purple_ball_1 room_4
gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4
```

I think our plan is optimal, but I want to see if we can optimize it further.

Actually, do we need to pick up and drop purple_ball_1? The goal says "There is a ball v such that 'The following conditions are all true: "v is purple", "v is in room_4", "you are in room_4", "you are in front of v"'"

So the goal doesn't actually require us to touch the ball, just be in front of it in room_4. But constraint 7 says "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'At least one of the following conditions is true: you are holding purple_ball_1, you are holding some object'". This could be satisfied by holding grey_box_2, which my plan does.

Let's also check constraint 6: "If expression you are in front of purple_ball_1 holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: 'At least one of the following conditions is true: you are holding some object, blue_door_2 is not locked'". 

In my plan, blue_door_2 is unlocked before I go in front of purple_ball_1, and I'm also holding grey_box_2, so this constraint is satisfied.

Given these considerations, I think my plan can be optimized as follows:

```
gotoobject grey_box_2 room_2
pick grey_box_2 room_2
gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1
toggle blue_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_1 blue_door_1
gotodoor blue_door_2 room_1 room_3
toggle blue_door_2
gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_2
gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4
toggle green_door_1
gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_2
gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_2
gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_1
gotoempty
drop grey_box_2 room_4
gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4
```

Actually, we can optimize the plan even further by removing the pick and drop steps. I've been misinterpreting constraint 7, which doesn't say we have to pick up something; it just says there should be a state where either we're holding purple_ball_1 or some other object. Let's check:

1. gotoobject grey_box_2 room_2: I'm in room_2, grey_box_2 is in room_2, so I can go in front of it.
2. pick grey_box_2 room_2: I'm in front of grey_box_2, I'm not holding any object, so I can pick it up.

After step 2, I am holding grey_box_2, so constraint 7 is satisfied. I don't need to pick up purple_ball_1 to satisfy constraint 7.

Let's now check constraint 6 again: "If expression you are in front of purple_ball_1 holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: 'At least one of the following conditions is true: you are holding some object, blue_door_2 is not locked'".

After step 7, blue_door_2 is unlocked, so when I go in front of purple_ball_1 later, this constraint is satisfied. I don't need to pick up anything else to satisfy this constraint.

Constraint 10 says "If expression you are in room_2 holds in some state s, then expression you are holding some object must hold at s or at some state after s". I am in room_2 in the initial state and also at steps 1-4, and I am holding grey_box_2 after step 2, so this constraint is satisfied.

So, my optimization is valid. But I realized I'm still holding grey_box_2 when I go in front of purple_ball_1. Since the goal requires me to be in front of purple_ball_1, I need to drop grey_box_2 first.

So, let's revise one more time:

```
gotoobject grey_box_2 room_2
pick grey_box_2 room_2
gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1
toggle blue_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_1 blue_door_1
gotodoor blue_door_2 room_1 room_3
toggle blue_door_2
gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_2
gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4
toggle green_door_1
gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_2
gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_2
gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_1
gotoempty
drop grey_box_2 room_4
gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4
```

It's optimal since I don't pick up any unnecessary object or do any unnecessary action, yet I still fulfill all the constraints and achieve the goal.

Actually, let me check one more thing: do I need to drop grey_box_2? The goal doesn't say I can't be holding something while being in front of purple_ball_1. It only requires me to be in room_4 in front of purple_ball_1. But I think I can't go in front of purple_ball_1 while holding grey_box_2, as the effect of the goto object action says I'd no longer be in front of whatever I was in front of before (which would be grey_box_2 right after I pick it up).

Hmm, but I think "goto object" is different from "being in front of an object". I can move to another object (the effect of the goto object action is that I'm no longer in front of the previous object and now in front of the new object).

Actually I think I do need to drop grey_box_2 before I can go in front of purple_ball_1. The reason is that after picking up grey_box_2, I am not in front of grey_box_2 anymore (as per the effect of the pick action), and then I can go to other objects or locations.

So, my plan as it stands is correct:

```
gotoobject grey_box_2 room_2
pick grey_box_2 room_2
gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1
toggle blue_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_1 blue_door_1
gotodoor blue_door_2 room_1 room_3
toggle blue_door_2
gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_2
gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4
toggle green_door_1
gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_2
gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_2
gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_1
gotoempty
drop grey_box_2 room_4
gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4
```

This plan satisfies all the constraints and achieves the goal, and it's optimal. I don't see a way to further minimize the number of actions.
