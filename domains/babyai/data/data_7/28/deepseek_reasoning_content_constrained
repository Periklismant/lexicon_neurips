Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. The goal is to end up in front of a blue door that connects room_1 and room_2, which is unlocked. The door in question here is blue_door_1 because it's the blue one connecting those rooms. But currently, all doors are locked, so I need to unlock blue_door_1. However, the constraints complicate things. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, the initial state: the agent is in room_3. The blue_door_1 is locked, and it connects room_1 and room_2. The final goal requires being in front of this door with it unlocked. So, the plan must include unlocking blue_door_1, which requires toggling it. But to toggle a door, the agent must be in front of it. So, the agent needs to get to blue_door_1, which is in room_1 or room_2. Since the agent starts in room_3, they need to move through rooms to reach room_1 or room_2.

Wait, let's check the connections. The doors are: blue_door_1 connects room_1 and room_2, purple_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3, green_door_1 connects room_2 and room_4, and green_door_2 connects room_3 and room_4. All doors are initially locked. So, how can the agent move between rooms?

The agent is in room_3. To leave room_3, the doors connected to it are purple_door_1 (to room_1) and green_door_2 (to room_4). Both are locked. But the constraint says that purple_door_1 must remain locked in every state. So, the agent can't use purple_door_1. Therefore, the only way out of room_3 is through green_door_2 to room_4. But green_door_2 is locked. So the agent needs to unlock it. But to unlock it, they need to be in front of it. So first, go to green_door_2 in room_3, toggle it to unlock. Then go through to room_4.

But wait, the preconditions for gotodoor: you can go to a door if you're in a room connected by that door and there's no object blocking the position. Are there any objects blocking green_door_2 in room_3? The initial state lists purple_box_1 and grey_ball_1 in room_3. If either is in front of the door, they would block it. But the problem doesn't mention any objects blocking doors initially, so maybe they're not. Assuming they're not blocking, the agent can go to green_door_2.

So steps so far:

1. In room_3, goto green_door_2 (room_3 and room_4 are connected via green_door_2). Use gotodoor green_door_2 room_3 room_4. Then toggle it to unlock. Then go through to room_4.

Once in room_4, there's grey_box_1 and green_ball_1. The constraints require that in some state, the agent is in room_1. But how to get to room_1 from room_4? The path would be room_4 to room_2 via green_door_1, then room_2 to room_1 via blue_door_1. But blue_door_1 is locked. So need to unlock blue_door_1. But blue_door_1 is in room_1 and room_2. To unlock it, the agent must be in front of it. So the agent needs to get to either room_1 or room_2, then go to the door and toggle it.

But the agent starts in room_3, can go to room_4 via green_door_2 (unlocking it first). Then from room_4, can go to room_2 via green_door_1. But green_door_1 is locked. So need to unlock that door as well. So steps:

From room_4, go to green_door_1 (connects room_4 and room_2), toggle it to unlock. Then go to room_2. Now in room_2. From room_2, blue_door_1 connects to room_1. But blue_door_1 is locked. So need to get to blue_door_1, toggle it. But the agent is in room_2. So gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1, then toggle to unlock. Then go through blue_door_1 to room_1. But the goal is to be in front of blue_door_1, unlocked, so maybe after unlocking it, they can stay in front of it.

But wait, the goal requires that the agent is in front of d (blue_door_1), which is unlocked. So once they toggle it, it's unlocked. So if they are in front of it after toggling, that's the goal.

But let's track the steps. Let's outline possible steps:

1. Start in room_3.

To get to room_4:

- goto door green_door_2 in room_3. Precondition: in room connected by door (room_3), and no object blocking. Assuming possible.

Action: gotodoor green_door_2 room_3 room_4.

Then toggle green_door_2 to unlock.

Then go to room_4 via gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_2.

Now in room_4. Next, need to unlock green_door_1 (connects room_4 and room_2).

But the constraint requires that in at least one state, green_door_1 is not locked. So perhaps we need to unlock it.

So from room_4, gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2. Then toggle it. Now it's unlocked. Then go to room_2 via green_door_1.

In room_2. Now, to unlock blue_door_1 (connects room_1 and room_2). So go to blue_door_1 in room_2. Action: gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1. Then toggle it to unlock. Now, the agent is in front of blue_door_1, which is unlocked. This satisfies the goal. But wait, the goal is to have such a door d where all conditions are true. So this would be achieved here.

But let's check the constraints:

Constraints:

1. purple_door_1 must always be locked. Since we never touch it, that's okay.

2. green_door_1 must be unlocked in at least one state. When we toggled it, it was unlocked. Then if we later lock it again, that would violate. But the constraint is "at least one state". So unlocking it once suffices.

3. Must be in room_1 at some point. But in the current steps, the agent goes from room_2 to room_1 via blue_door_1 after unlocking it. But wait, the goal doesn't require being in room_1, but one of the constraints requires that the agent is in room_1 in some state. So maybe after unlocking blue_door_1, the agent can go to room_1. But that's optional. However, the constraint says that if the agent is in room_1 in some state, there must be an earlier state where they were in room_4 or in front of green_door_1. Let's see: in the current steps, the agent goes to room_4, then to room_2. If they later go to room_1, then the earlier state of being in room_4 satisfies the constraint.

But the constraint says "if you are in room_1 in some state, then there's an earlier state where you are in room_4 or in front of green_door_1". Since the agent is in room_4 before going to room_2, then room_1, that would satisfy it.

Another constraint: if you are in front of purple_door_1 in some state, then earlier you held green_ball_1 or grey_ball_1 is in room_4. Since in the initial state, grey_ball_1 is in room_3. So if the agent moves grey_ball_1 to room_4, then that would satisfy the condition. But the problem states that the agent must be in front of purple_door_1 in some state. So perhaps the plan requires going to purple_door_1. Wait, looking back, one of the constraints is "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'you are in front of purple_door_1'". So the plan must include being in front of purple_door_1 at some point. But how? Because the agent starts in room_3, and purple_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3. So to get to purple_door_1 from room_3, the agent can go there. But purple_door_1 is locked and must remain locked. So the agent can go to the door, but can't go through it. But since the constraint requires being in front of it, perhaps the agent needs to go to purple_door_1 in room_3. But how? Because room_3 is connected to room_1 via purple_door_1. So in room_3, the agent can use gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_1. Then they are in front of purple_door_1. But then, the precondition for being in front of a door is that you are in a room connected by the door, and no object is blocking. Since the agent is in room_3, which is connected via purple_door_1, and assuming no objects are blocking, they can go to the door. So the plan must include this step. But when?

Also, the constraint for being in front of purple_door_1 requires that in an earlier state, the agent was holding green_ball_1 or grey_ball_1 is in room_4. Initially, grey_ball_1 is in room_3. So unless the agent moves it to room_4, the other option is to hold green_ball_1. But green_ball_1 is in room_4. So the agent needs to get to room_4, pick up green_ball_1, then go to purple_door_1. But how to get back to room_3 from room_4? Let's see. From room_4, they can go back to room_3 via green_door_2 (already unlocked), but then need to go to room_3's purple_door_1. But the agent is already in room_3, so they can go to purple_door_1. So steps would be:

After getting to room_4, go to green_ball_1, pick it up. Then return to room_3 via green_door_2. Then go to purple_door_1 in room_3. Then that would satisfy the condition for being in front of purple_door_1, because earlier they held green_ball_1. But this adds several steps. Let's see:

Original steps up to unlocking blue_door_1:

1. In room_3, go to green_door_2 (room_3 and room_4)
2. Toggle green_door_2 to unlock.
3. Gotoroom room_3 to room_4 via green_door_2.
4. In room_4, go to green_door_1 (room_4 and room_2)
5. Toggle green_door_1 to unlock.
6. Gotoroom room_4 to room_2 via green_door_1.
7. In room_2, go to blue_door_1 (room_2 and room_1)
8. Toggle blue_door_1 to unlock.
9. Now in front of blue_door_1, which is unlocked. Goal achieved.

But this plan misses several constraints:

- Must be in front of purple_door_1 at some state. So need to add steps to go there.

- Also, another constraint: if you are in front of blue_door_1 in some state, then in an earlier state, yellow_box_1 is in room_4. Currently, yellow_box_1 is in room_2. So we need to move yellow_box_1 to room_4 before being in front of blue_door_1.

So, the agent must move yellow_box_1 from room_2 to room_4. To do that, the agent needs to be in room_2, pick up the yellow_box_1, carry it to room_4 via green_door_1, then drop it there. But to pick up a box, the agent needs to be in the same room as the box and not holding anything. So steps would be:

After step 6 (in room_2), before going to blue_door_1:

6.1. In room_2, gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_2.

6.2. Pick yellow_box_1.

6.3. Goto door green_door_1 (room_2 and room_4)

6.4. Gotoroom room_2 to room_4 via green_door_1.

6.5. Drop yellow_box_1 in room_4.

Then, return to room_2:

6.6. Goto door green_door_1 in room_4.

6.7. Gotoroom room_4 to room_2 via green_door_1.

Now, yellow_box_1 is in room_4. Then proceed to step 7 (go to blue_door_1, toggle, etc.)

But this adds a lot of steps. Let's check if there's a shorter path.

Alternatively, maybe the agent can move the yellow_box_1 earlier. Let's think:

The agent starts in room_3. To get to room_2, they have to go through room_4 and then room_2. But initially, all doors are locked. So the agent unlocks green_door_2 to get to room_4, then unlocks green_door_1 to get to room_2. Then in room_2, they can pick up yellow_box_1 and take it to room_4.

But how to carry the box: need to pick it up, then go to room_4, drop it. Then return to room_2 to proceed.

This adds steps but is necessary to satisfy the constraint that when in front of blue_door_1, yellow_box_1 was in room_4 in an earlier state.

So now, the plan would look like:

1. gotodoor green_door_2 room_3 room_4

2. toggle green_door_2

3. gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_2

4. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2

5. toggle green_door_1

6. gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_1

7. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_2

8. pick yellow_box_1 room_2

9. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4

10. gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1

11. drop yellow_box_1 room_4

12. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2

13. gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_1

14. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1

15. toggle blue_door_1

Now, after step 15, the agent is in front of blue_door_1, which is unlocked. That meets the goal. But we also need to check other constraints:

- The constraint that in some state, the agent is in room_1. If the agent goes to room_1, that's another step. But the goal doesn't require being in room_1. However, the constraint says that in at least one state, the agent is in room_1. So the agent must go there. So after unlocking blue_door_1, they can go to room_1.

16. gotoroom room_2 room_1 blue_door_1

Now, they are in room_1. But according to the constraint, if they are in room_1 in some state, there must be an earlier state where they were in room_4 or in front of green_door_1. The earlier steps include being in room_4 (steps 3-5, 10-12), which satisfies this.

Another constraint: being in front of purple_door_1 at some state. So the agent must go to purple_door_1 in room_3. But how? After step 3, the agent is in room_4, then moves to room_2, etc. To get back to room_3, they need to go through room_4 via green_door_2 (already unlocked). So after step 15, perhaps go back to room_3:

17. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4

18. gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1

19. gotodoor green_door_2 room_4 room_3

20. gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_2

21. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_1

22. (now in front of purple_door_1)

But according to the constraint, when in front of purple_door_1, there must be an earlier state where the agent held green_ball_1 or grey_ball_1 is in room_4. The agent hasn't handled the green_ball_1 yet. The green_ball_1 is in room_4. So to satisfy the condition, maybe moving grey_ball_1 to room_4. The grey_ball_1 is initially in room_3. So steps to move it:

But the agent is in room_3 after step 20. They can pick up grey_ball_1 in room_3, carry it to room_4.

But how? Let's see:

After step 20, agent is in room_3.

23. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_3

24. pick grey_ball_1 room_3

25. gotodoor green_door_2 room_3 room_4

26. gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_2

27. drop grey_ball_1 room_4

Now, grey_ball_1 is in room_4. Then, go back to room_3 to get to purple_door_1:

28. gotodoor green_door_2 room_4 room_3

29. gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_2

30. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_1

Now, in front of purple_door_1. Since grey_ball_1 is now in room_4, the earlier state (step 27) satisfies the constraint. So steps 23-30 would handle that.

But this adds a lot of steps. However, maybe there's a shorter way. For example, if the agent picks up green_ball_1 in room_4 and then goes to purple_door_1. Let's see:

After step 11 (dropping yellow_box_1 in room_4), the agent is in room_4. Then they could:

12. gotoobject green_ball_1 room_4

13. pick green_ball_1 room_4

14. gotodoor green_door_2 room_4 room_3

15. gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_2

16. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_1

Now, in front of purple_door_1. Since they are holding green_ball_1, the constraint is satisfied (earlier state where they held green_ball_1). Then they can drop it somewhere, but perhaps that's not necessary. But this requires adjusting the earlier steps.

Let me try to reorganize the steps to minimize backtracking. Let's see:

1. Unlock green_door_2 and go to room_4.

2. In room_4, unlock green_door_1, go to room_2.

3. In room_2, pick up yellow_box_1, take it to room_4, drop it.

4. Return to room_2, unlock blue_door_1.

5. Go to room_1 (to satisfy being in room_1).

6. Then return to room_3 via room_4 and green_door_2.

7. In room_3, go to purple_door_1 (satisfying the constraint with grey_ball_1 in room_4, which was moved earlier? Or pick up green_ball_1 earlier).

Alternatively, when in room_4, after dropping yellow_box_1, pick up green_ball_1, then go to room_3, then go to purple_door_1 while holding green_ball_1. This would satisfy the condition for being in front of purple_door_1.

Let me outline:

Steps:

1. gotodoor green_door_2 room_3 room_4

2. toggle green_door_2

3. gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_2

4. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2

5. toggle green_door_1

6. gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_1

7. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_2

8. pick yellow_box_1 room_2

9. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4

10. gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1

11. drop yellow_box_1 room_4

12. gotoobject green_ball_1 room_4

13. pick green_ball_1 room_4

14. gotodoor green_door_2 room_4 room_3

15. gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_2

16. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_1

(Now in front of purple_door_1, and holding green_ball_1. So the constraint is satisfied because in an earlier state (step 13), they were holding green_ball_1.)

17. drop green_ball_1 room_3 (optional, but not necessary unless needed)

18. gotodoor green_door_2 room_3 room_4

19. gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_2

20. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2

21. gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_1

22. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1

23. toggle blue_door_1

24. gotoroom room_2 room_1 blue_door_1 (to satisfy being in room_1)

But this seems lengthy, but maybe necessary. Now, checking constraints:

- purple_door_1 remains locked (step 16: agent is in front of it but didn't toggle, so it's still locked. Good.)

- green_door_1 was toggled once (unlocked at step 5, then possibly locked again if toggled again? Wait, no. The effect of toggle is to unlock if locked, lock if unlocked. Since green_door_1 was locked, toggling it once makes it unlocked. If we don't toggle it again, it remains unlocked. But the constraint is that in at least one state it's not locked. Step 5 satisfies that.

- Being in room_1 is achieved in step 24.

- The condition for being in room_1: earlier state was room_4 (steps 3, 10, 14, etc.)

- Being in front of purple_door_1 at step 16.

- The condition for being in front of purple_door_1: earlier state holding green_ball_1 (step 13-16).

- Being in front of blue_door_1 at step 22-23, and earlier yellow_box_1 was moved to room_4 (step 11).

- The constraint that in some state, the agent is in room_2 or holding an object. For example, when holding yellow_box_1 (steps 8-11) or green_ball_1 (steps 13-17), that satisfies "holding some object".

- The constraint that blue_box_1 is in room_3. Initially, blue_box_1 is in room_1. The agent needs to move it to room_3. Wait, that's another constraint I missed! The last constraint is "blue_box_1 is in room_3" in at least one state. Oh right! So the agent must move blue_box_1 from room_1 to room_3. But how? Because blue_box_1 is in room_1 initially. The agent hasn't been to room_1 yet until step 24. So after getting to room_1, the agent must pick up blue_box_1 and take it to room_3.

So adding steps after step 24:

25. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1

26. pick blue_box_1 room_1

27. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2

28. gotoroom room_1 room_2 blue_door_1

29. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4

30. gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1

31. gotodoor green_door_2 room_4 room_3

32. gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_2

33. drop blue_box_1 room_3

Now, blue_box_1 is in room_3. This satisfies the last constraint.

But this adds even more steps. This is getting quite long. Let's check if there's a more optimal path.

Alternative approach: Maybe the agent can go to room_1 earlier via a different route. But purple_door_1 is locked and must remain so. So the only way to room_1 is through blue_door_1 after unlocking it.

Wait, but to unlock blue_door_1, the agent needs to be in front of it. So steps would be:

1. Unlock green_door_2, go to room_4.

2. Unlock green_door_1, go to room_2.

3. In room_2, unlock blue_door_1.

4. Go to room_1 via blue_door_1.

5. Pick blue_box_1 and take it back to room_3.

But this requires:

5. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1

6. pick blue_box_1

7. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2

8. gotoroom room_1 room_2 blue_door_1

9. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4

10. gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1

11. gotodoor green_door_2 room_4 room_3

12. gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_2

13. drop blue_box_1 room_3

But this adds steps. So the complete plan would be:

1. gotodoor green_door_2 room_3 room_4

2. toggle green_door_2

3. gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_2

4. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2

5. toggle green_door_1

6. gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_1

7. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_2

8. pick yellow_box_1 room_2

9. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4

10. gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1

11. drop yellow_box_1 room_4

12. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2

13. gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_1

14. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1

15. toggle blue_door_1

16. gotoroom room_2 room_1 blue_door_1

17. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1

18. pick blue_box_1 room_1

19. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2

20. gotoroom room_1 room_2 blue_door_1

21. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4

22. gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1

23. gotodoor green_door_2 room_4 room_3

24. gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_2

25. drop blue_box_1 room_3

26. gotoobject green_ball_1 room_4

But wait, after step 11, the agent is in room_4. Maybe after step 11, they can pick up green_ball_1 before returning to room_2.

Let's adjust:

After step 11:

12. gotoobject green_ball_1 room_4

13. pick green_ball_1 room_4

14. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2

15. gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_1

16. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1

17. toggle blue_door_1

18. gotoroom room_2 room_1 blue_door_1

19. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1

20. pick blue_box_1 room_1

21. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2

22. gotoroom room_1 room_2 blue_door_1

23. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4

24. gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1

25. gotodoor green_door_2 room_4 room_3

26. gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_2

27. drop blue_box_1 room_3

28. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_1

Now, in front of purple_door_1. Since the agent is holding green_ball_1 from step 13 until they drop it. But step 28 requires being in front of purple_door_1. So after step 27, they can go to purple_door_1.

29. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_1

Now, they are in front of purple_door_1, and earlier they were holding green_ball_1 (steps 13-27). So that satisfies the constraint.

But then they need to drop green_ball_1 somewhere. Maybe in room_3:

30. drop green_ball_1 room_3

But this is getting very long. The optimal plan requires the shortest possible steps. Let's see if there's a way to combine some steps.

Wait, the constraint for blue_box_1 in room_3 can be satisfied by moving it there. But perhaps there's a way to move it while handling other constraints. For example, when the agent is in room_3 after step 26, they can drop blue_box_1 there. Then, when going to purple_door_1, they are in front of it, and since they were holding green_ball_1 earlier, the constraint is met.

But this seems necessary. So the plan must include moving yellow_box_1 to room_4, moving blue_box_1 to room_3, and ensuring the agent is in front of purple_door_1 while having held green_ball_1 or moved grey_ball_1 to room_4.

This is quite complex, but the key is to satisfy all constraints. Now, putting it all together in the shortest possible way:

1. gotodoor green_door_2 room_3 room_4

2. toggle green_door_2

3. gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_2

4. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2

5. toggle green_door_1

6. gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_1

7. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_2

8. pick yellow_box_1 room_2

9. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4

10. gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1

11. drop yellow_box_1 room_4

12. gotoobject green_ball_1 room_4

13. pick green_ball_1 room_4

14. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2

15. gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_1

16. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1

17. toggle blue_door_1

18. gotoroom room_2 room_1 blue_door_1

19. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1

20. pick blue_box_1 room_1

21. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2

22. gotoroom room_1 room_2 blue_door_1

23. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4

24. gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1

25. gotodoor green_door_2 room_4 room_3

26. gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_2

27. drop blue_box_1 room_3

28. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_1

Now, the agent is in front of purple_door_1 (step 28), having previously held green_ball_1 (steps 13-26). The constraints are satisfied.

But the final goal is to be in front of blue_door_1, which was achieved at step 17. However, after step 17, the agent moved to room_1. So to meet the goal, the final state must be in front of blue_door_1. So perhaps the agent needs to return to blue_door_1 after unlocking it.

Wait, in step 17, after toggling blue_door_1, the agent is in front of it (action: gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1, then toggle. So after toggle, they are still in front of blue_door_1 in room_2. Then, to go to room_1, they use gotoroom, which moves them into room_1 but no longer in front of the door. So the goal requires being in front of blue_door_1. Therefore, after step 17, the agent is in front of blue_door_1, which is unlocked. That satisfies the goal. Then steps 18 and beyond are to satisfy other constraints.

But the goal is already achieved at step 17. However, the other constraints require additional steps, but those steps must be included in the plan. The problem states that the plan must bring about the goal while satisfying all constraints. So the plan must include all actions necessary to achieve the goal and satisfy constraints, even if some actions come after the goal is technically achieved. However, the optimal plan is the shortest possible. So perhaps there's a way to arrange the steps to achieve the goal and satisfy all constraints with fewer actions.

Let me re-express the steps:

Main goal: be in front of blue_door_1 (unlocked).

Constraints:

- purple_door_1 always locked.

- green_door_1 unlocked in some state.

- be in room_1 at some state.

- if in room_1, must have been in room_4 or front of green_door_1 earlier.

- be in front of purple_door_1 once.

- if in front of purple_door_1, must have held green_ball_1 or grey_ball_1 in room_4.

- be in front of blue_door_1 once.

- if in front of blue_door_1, yellow_box_1 must have been in room_4 earlier.

- in some state, be in room_2 or holding something.

- blue_box_1 in room_3.

Possible plan steps:

1. Unlock green_door_2 and go to room_4.

2. Unlock green_door_1 and go to room_2.

3. Pick yellow_box_1, take to room_4, drop it.

4. Return to room_2, go to blue_door_1, unlock it. Now in front of blue_door_1 (goal met).

5. Go to room_1 (satisfies being in room_1, which requires earlier step in room_4).

6. Pick blue_box_1, take to room_3.

7. While in room_3, go to purple_door_1. To satisfy the purple_door_1 constraint, ensure that grey_ball_1 is in room_4 or that the agent held green_ball_1.

Option: Move grey_ball_1 from room_3 to room_4.

But how? The agent is in room_3 after step 6. If they have to move grey_ball_1, they can pick it up and take it to room_4.

8. In room_3, pick grey_ball_1.

9. Go to room_4 via green_door_2.

10. Drop grey_ball_1 in room_4.

11. Return to room_3.

12. Go to purple_door_1.

This adds steps but ensures grey_ball_1 is in room_4. Alternatively, pick green_ball_1 in room_4 and hold it while going to purple_door_1.

But let's see:

After step 3, yellow_box_1 is in room_4. The agent is in room_4. They can pick green_ball_1 there.

4. gotoobject green_ball_1 room_4.

5. pick green_ball_1.

6. go to room_2 via green_door_1.

7. proceed to unlock blue_door_1, then go to room_1, then return to room_3 with blue_box_1.

While holding green_ball_1, when they go to purple_door_1, they satisfy the constraint.

This might reduce steps.

Alternative plan:

1. gotodoor green_door_2 room_3 room_4

2. toggle green_door_2

3. gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_2

4. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2

5. toggle green_door_1

6. gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_1

7. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_2

8. pick yellow_box_1 room_2

9. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4

10. gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1

11. drop yellow_box_1 room_4

12. gotoobject green_ball_1 room_4

13. pick green_ball_1 room_4

14. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2

15. gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_1

16. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1

17. toggle blue_door_1

18. (now in front of blue_door_1, unlocked. Goal achieved.)

19. gotoroom room_2 room_1 blue_door_1 (to be in room_1)

20. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1

21. pick blue_box_1 room_1

22. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2

23. gotoroom room_1 room_2 blue_door_1

24. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4

25. gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1

26. gotodoor green_door_2 room_4 room_3

27. gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_2

28. drop blue_box_1 room_3

29. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_1

Now, at step 29, in front of purple_door_1, and earlier held green_ball_1 (step 13-27). This satisfies the constraint.

Also, blue_box_1 is in room_3 (step 28).

But this is still a long plan. Is there a shorter way?

Alternative approach: After step 17 (unlocking blue_door_1 and being in front of it), the agent needs to:

- Be in room_1 at some point.

- Move blue_box_1 to room_3.

- Be in front of purple_door_1.

- Ensure that when in front of purple_door_1, the agent has held green_ball_1 or grey_ball_1 is in room_4.

If the agent picks up green_ball_1 before returning to room_3, they can carry it to room_3 and then go to purple_door_1 while holding it.

So after step 11 (yellow_box_1 in room_4):

12. gotoobject green_ball_1 room_4

13. pick green_ball_1 room_4

14. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2

15. gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_1

16. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1

17. toggle blue_door_1

18. gotoroom room_2 room_1 blue_door_1 (now in room_1)

19. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1

20. pick blue_box_1 room_1

21. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2

22. gotoroom room_1 room_2 blue_door_1

23. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4

24. gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1

25. gotodoor green_door_2 room_4 room_3

26. gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_2

27. drop blue_box_1 room_3

28. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_1

Now, agent is in front of purple_door_1, and held green_ball_1 from steps 13-27. So the constraint is satisfied. This plan includes all necessary steps.

But is there a way to combine some steps to make it shorter?

For example, after step 17 (toggle blue_door_1), the agent is in front of blue_door_1, which is unlocked. The goal is achieved here. However, the constraints require other steps. But perhaps the agent can proceed to room_1, get blue_box_1, and then on the way back, handle the purple_door_1 and green_ball_1.

Alternatively, after step 13 (picking green_ball_1 in room_4), the agent can carry it through to room_2, then room_1, then back to room_3, and then go to purple_door_1.

This way, they are holding green_ball_1 when going to purple_door_1.

So steps:

1. Unlock green_door_2, go to room_4.

2. Unlock green_door_1, go to room_2.

3. Move yellow_box_1 to room_4.

4. Pick green_ball_1 in room_4.

5. Go to room_2, then unlock blue_door_1.

6. Go to room_1, pick blue_box_1.

7. Return to room_3 via room_2, room_4.

8. Drop blue_box_1 in room_3.

9. Go to purple_door_1 while holding green_ball_1.

Then drop green_ball_1.

This would satisfy the purple_door_1 constraint because the agent was holding green_ball_1 earlier.

This might save some steps.

Let me outline:

1. gotodoor green_door_2 room_3 room_4

2. toggle green_door_2

3. gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_2

4. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2

5. toggle green_door_1

6. gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_1

7. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_2

8. pick yellow_box_1 room_2

9. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4

10. gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1

11. drop yellow_box_1 room_4

12. gotoobject green_ball_1 room_4

13. pick green_ball_1 room_4

14. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2

15. gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_1

16. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1

17. toggle blue_door_1

18. gotoroom room_2 room_1 blue_door_1

19. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1

20. pick blue_box_1 room_1

21. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2

22. gotoroom room_1 room_2 blue_door_1

23. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4

24. gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1

25. gotodoor green_door_2 room_4 room_3

26. gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_2

27. drop blue_box_1 room_3

28. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_1

29. drop green_ball_1 room_3

Now, all constraints are met. The agent was in front of purple_door_1 while holding green_ball_1 (steps 13-28). The agent is in room_1 (step 18). The agent moved yellow_box_1 to room_4 (step 11). The agent moved blue_box_1 to room_3 (step 27). The agent is in front of blue_door_1 at step 17, with it unlocked. All constraints satisfied.

This seems to be the necessary sequence. The plan is long but meets all requirements. Since the problem requires an optimal plan (shortest possible), let's check if any steps can be omitted.

For example, after step 17, the agent is in front of blue_door_1, which is unlocked. The goal is achieved here. The remaining steps are to satisfy constraints. However, the agent must perform those steps to meet all constraints. Thus, the entire sequence is required.

The optimal plan may require 29 steps, but perhaps some steps can be optimized. For instance, after dropping blue_box_1 in room_3 (step 27), the agent is already in room_3. They can immediately go to purple_door_1 (step 28) without needing to drop green_ball_1 first, as long as they are still holding it. So step 29 (drop green_ball_1) is optional unless required by another constraint. But since there's no constraint about dropping it, it can be omitted. So steps 28 and 29 can be adjusted:

27. drop blue_box_1 room_3

28. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_1 (still holding green_ball_1)

This satisfies the purple_door_1 constraint, as the agent is holding green_ball_1. Then they can drop it if needed, but it's not necessary. So step 29 can be omitted, saving one action.

Thus, the final plan would have 28 steps. But even this is quite long. Perhaps there's a way to further shorten it.

Wait, after step 13, the agent is holding green_ball_1. When they proceed to room_2, then room_1, then back to room_3, they can still be holding it. Then, when they go to purple_door_1 in room_3, they are holding green_ball_1, which satisfies the constraint. So they don't need to drop it unless required. So step 29 can be omitted, reducing the plan.

So the adjusted steps are:

... up to step 27:

27. drop blue_box_1 room_3

28. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_1

Now, the agent is in front of purple_door_1, holding green_ball_1. This meets the constraint. They don't need to drop it.

Thus, the total steps are 28.

But this is still a lengthy plan. However, given the multiple constraints, this may be the minimal steps required. It's possible that no shorter plan exists that satisfies all constraints. Therefore, the answer is the sequence outlined above.
