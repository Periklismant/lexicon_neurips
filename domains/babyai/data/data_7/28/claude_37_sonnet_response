Alright, I need to solve a planning problem for a 2D gridworld with 4 rooms. Let me break down the problem and create a plan.

First, I'll understand the current state of the world:

1. I am in room_3.
2. red_box_1 and blue_box_1 and purple_ball_1 are in room_1.
3. yellow_box_1 is in room_2.
4. purple_box_1 and grey_ball_1 are in room_3.
5. grey_box_1 and green_ball_1 are in room_4.
6. All doors (blue_door_1, purple_door_1, green_door_1, green_door_2) are locked.
7. room_1 and room_2 are connected via blue_door_1.
8. room_1 and room_3 are connected via purple_door_1.
9. room_2 and room_4 are connected via green_door_1.
10. room_3 and room_4 are connected via green_door_2.
11. I have visited room_3 (where I am initially).

The goal is to be in front of blue_door_1 (which connects room_1 and room_2), and have it unlocked.

Now, let's consider the constraints:

1. purple_door_1 must always remain locked.
2. green_door_1 must be unlocked at some point.
3. I must be in room_1 at some point.
4. Before being in room_1, I must have been in room_4 or in front of green_door_1.
5. I must be in front of purple_door_1 at some point.
6. Before being in front of purple_door_1, I must hold green_ball_1, or grey_ball_1 must be in room_4.
7. I must be in front of blue_door_1 at some point (this is part of the goal).
8. Before being in front of blue_door_1, yellow_box_1 must be in room_4.
9. I must be in room_2 or hold some object at some point.
10. blue_box_1 must be in room_3 at some point.

Now, let me think of a plan:

0. Start in room_3.
1. I need to make sure blue_box_1 is in room_3 at some point, but it's currently in room_1. I'll need to get it.
2. Before being in front of blue_door_1, yellow_box_1 must be in room_4, but it's currently in room_2. I'll need to move it.
3. Before being in front of purple_door_1, either I need to be holding green_ball_1 or grey_ball_1 needs to be in room_4. grey_ball_1 is in room_3 (with me), and green_ball_1 is in room_4. I can either move grey_ball_1 to room_4 or get green_ball_1 and hold it.
4. Before being in room_1, I need to have been in room_4 or in front of green_door_1.
5. And I need to unlock green_door_1 at some point.

Let's use the following strategy:

1. Go to grey_ball_1 in room_3, pick it up.
2. Go to green_door_2 (which connects room_3 and room_4), toggle it to unlock it, and go to room_4.
3. Drop grey_ball_1 in room_4. Now, "grey_ball_1 is in room_4" is true, which satisfies one of the conditions for constraint 6.
4. Go to green_ball_1 in room_4, pick it up.
5. Go to green_door_1 (which connects room_2 and room_4), toggle it to unlock it. Now, "green_door_1 is not locked" is true, which satisfies constraint 2.
6. Go to room_2 via green_door_1. Now, "you are in room_2" is true, which satisfies constraint 9.
7. Go to yellow_box_1 in room_2, pick it up.
8. Go back to room_4 via green_door_1.
9. Drop yellow_box_1 in room_4. Now, "yellow_box_1 is in room_4" is true, which partially satisfies constraint 8.
10. Go back to room_3 via green_door_2.
11. Now, go to purple_door_1 (which connects room_1 and room_3). Now, "you are in front of purple_door_1" is true, which satisfies constraint 5. And since "grey_ball_1 is in room_4" is true, this fully satisfies constraint 6.
12. Go to purple_box_1 in room_3, pick it up. Now, "you are holding some object" is true, which fully satisfies constraint 9.
13. Go to green_door_2, go to room_4.
14. Go to green_door_1, go to room_2.
15. Go to blue_door_1 (which connects room_1 and room_2). Now, "you are in front of blue_door_1" is true, which satisfies constraint 7. And since "yellow_box_1 is in room_4" is true, this fully satisfies constraint 8.
16. Toggle blue_door_1 to unlock it. This partially satisfies the goal.
17. Go to room_1 via blue_door_1. Now, "you are in room_1" is true, which satisfies constraint 3. And since I was in room_4 earlier, this fully satisfies constraint 4.
18. Go to blue_box_1 in room_1, pick it up.
19. Go back to room_2 via blue_door_1.
20. Go to room_4 via green_door_1.
21. Go to room_3 via green_door_2.
22. Drop blue_box_1 in room_3. Now, "blue_box_1 is in room_3" is true, which satisfies constraint 10.
23. Pick up grey_ball_1 from room_3.
24. Go back to room_2 via room_4, then to room_1 via blue_door_1.
25. Go to blue_door_1, which achieves the goal: "There is a door d such that 'The following conditions are all true: "d is blue", "room_1 and room_2 are connected via d", "you are in front of d", "d is not locked"'"

Wait, let me review the above plan more carefully, because I'm not sure all of it is correct.

Actually, there's a problem with my plan. After I drop grey_ball_1 in room_4, I can't later pick it up from room_3. Let me readjust.

Actually, wait, there's another problem: I can't drop purple_box_1 in room_3 and then pick up grey_ball_1 from room_3, since I said earlier that grey_ball_1 is in room_4. 

Let me rethink the plan to make sure it's consistent:

1. Start in room_3.
2. Go to grey_ball_1 in room_3, pick it up. Now, "you are holding some object" is true, which satisfies constraint 9.
3. Go to green_door_2 (which connects room_3 and room_4), toggle it to unlock it, and go to room_4.
4. Drop grey_ball_1 in room_4. Now, "grey_ball_1 is in room_4" is true, which satisfies one of the conditions for constraint 6.
5. Go to green_door_1 (which connects room_2 and room_4), toggle it to unlock it. Now, "green_door_1 is not locked" is true, which satisfies constraint 2. Also, "you are in front of green_door_1" is true, which satisfies one of the conditions for constraint 4.
6. Go to room_2 via green_door_1. Now, "you are in room_2" is true, which satisfies constraint 9 (though we already had satisfied this with "you are holding some object").
7. Go to yellow_box_1 in room_2, pick it up.
8. Go back to room_4 via green_door_1.
9. Drop yellow_box_1 in room_4. Now, "yellow_box_1 is in room_4" is true, which partially satisfies constraint 8.
10. Go to green_ball_1 in room_4, pick it up.
11. Go back to room_3 via green_door_2.
12. Go to purple_door_1 (which connects room_1 and room_3). Now, "you are in front of purple_door_1" is true, which satisfies constraint 5. And since "grey_ball_1 is in room_4" is true and "you are holding green_ball_1" is true, this fully satisfies constraint 6.
13. Go to room_1 via toggling purple_door_1.
    - Wait, I can't toggle purple_door_1 because one of the constraints is that purple_door_1 must always remain locked.
    - So, I can't use purple_door_1 to go from room_3 to room_1.
14. Let's adjust: Instead of trying to go through purple_door_1, I'll go to room_2 via room_4, then to room_1 via blue_door_1. But first, I need to unlock blue_door_1, so:
15. Go to green_door_2, go to room_4.
16. Go to green_door_1, go to room_2.
17. Go to blue_door_1 (which connects room_1 and room_2). Now, "you are in front of blue_door_1" is true, which satisfies constraint 7. And since "yellow_box_1 is in room_4" is true, this fully satisfies constraint 8.
18. Toggle blue_door_1 to unlock it. This partially satisfies the goal.
19. Go to room_1 via blue_door_1. Now, "you are in room_1" is true, which satisfies constraint 3. And since I was in front of green_door_1 earlier, this fully satisfies constraint 4.
20. Go to blue_box_1 in room_1, pick it up. (I drop green_ball_1 first.)
21. Go back to room_2 via blue_door_1.
22. Go to room_4 via green_door_1.
23. Go to room_3 via green_door_2.
24. Drop blue_box_1 in room_3. Now, "blue_box_1 is in room_3" is true, which satisfies constraint 10.
25. Go back to room_2 via room_4, then to room_1 via blue_door_1.
26. Go to blue_door_1, which achieves the goal: "There is a door d such that 'The following conditions are all true: "d is blue", "room_1 and room_2 are connected via d", "you are in front of d", "d is not locked"'"

Whoops again, I need to be more precise.

Actually, looking at constraint 6 more carefully: "Before being in front of purple_door_1, I must either be holding green_ball_1 or grey_ball_1 must be in room_4."

So I don't need to satisfy both conditions, just one of them. I'll go with "grey_ball_1 is in room_4". And I'm not going to go through purple_door_1, just be in front of it.

Let me also note that based on the action description, "gotoobject" only allows going in front of an object if you're in the same room as it. But for doors, you use "gotodoor".

Let me readjust and be more systematic:

1. Start in room_3.
2. Go to grey_ball_1 in room_3: "gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_3"
3. Pick up grey_ball_1: "pick grey_ball_1 room_3"
   - Now I am holding an object, which satisfies constraint 9.
4. Go to green_door_2 (which connects room_3 and room_4): "gotodoor green_door_2 room_3 room_4"
5. Toggle it to unlock it: "toggle green_door_2"
6. Go to room_4 via green_door_2: "gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_2"
7. Drop grey_ball_1 in room_4: "drop grey_ball_1 room_4"
   - Now "grey_ball_1 is in room_4", which is one of the conditions for constraint 6.
8. Go to green_door_1 (which connects room_2 and room_4): "gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2"
9. Toggle it to unlock it: "toggle green_door_1"
   - Now "green_door_1 is not locked", which satisfies constraint 2.
   - Also, "you are in front of green_door_1", which is one of the conditions for constraint 4.
10. Go to room_2 via green_door_1: "gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_1"
    - Now "you are in room_2", which is one of the conditions for constraint 9.
11. Go to yellow_box_1 in room_2: "gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_2"
12. Pick up yellow_box_1: "pick yellow_box_1 room_2"
13. Go to green_door_1: "gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4"
14. Go to room_4 via green_door_1: "gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1"
15. Drop yellow_box_1 in room_4: "drop yellow_box_1 room_4"
    - Now "yellow_box_1 is in room_4", which is needed for constraint 8.
16. Go back to room_2 via green_door_1: "gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_1"
17. Go to blue_door_1 (which connects room_1 and room_2): "gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1"
    - Now "you are in front of blue_door_1", which satisfies constraint 7.
    - Since "yellow_box_1 is in room_4", this fully satisfies constraint 8.
18. Toggle blue_door_1 to unlock it: "toggle blue_door_1"
19. Go to room_1 via blue_door_1: "gotoroom room_2 room_1 blue_door_1"
    - Now "you are in room_1", which satisfies constraint 3.
    - Since I was in front of green_door_1 earlier, this fully satisfies constraint 4.
20. Go to blue_box_1 in room_1: "gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1"
21. Pick up blue_box_1: "pick blue_box_1 room_1"
22. Go to blue_door_1: "gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2"
23. Go to room_2 via blue_door_1: "gotoroom room_1 room_2 blue_door_1"
24. Go to green_door_1: "gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4"
25. Go to room_4 via green_door_1: "gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1"
26. Go to green_door_2: "gotodoor green_door_2 room_4 room_3"
27. Go to room_3 via green_door_2: "gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_2"
28. Drop blue_box_1 in room_3: "drop blue_box_1 room_3"
    - Now "blue_box_1 is in room_3", which satisfies constraint 10.
29. Go to purple_door_1: "gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_1"
    - Now "you are in front of purple_door_1", which satisfies constraint 5.
    - Since "grey_ball_1 is in room_4", this fully satisfies constraint 6.
30. Go back to green_door_2: "gotodoor green_door_2 room_3 room_4"
31. Go to room_4 via green_door_2: "gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_2"
32. Go to green_door_1: "gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2"
33. Go to room_2 via green_door_1: "gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_1"
34. Go to blue_door_1: "gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1"
35. Go to room_1 via blue_door_1: "gotoroom room_2 room_1 blue_door_1"
36. Go to blue_door_1 from room_1: "gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2"
    - This achieves the goal: "There is a door d such that 'The following conditions are all true: "d is blue", "room_1 and room_2 are connected via d", "you are in front of d", "d is not locked"'"

This is not a good plan; it's overly complicated. Let me review it and simplify.

Also, I realized I never visited room_1 from room_3 using purple_door_1, which was in my original plan. 

Actually, looking at constraint 1: "The following expression must hold in every state: 'purple_door_1 is locked'", I can't unlock purple_door_1 at all, so I can't visit room_1 from room_3 directly. I need to go through room_2.

OK let me revise the plan one more time:

1. Start in room_3.
2. Go to grey_ball_1 in room_3: "gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_3"
3. Pick up grey_ball_1: "pick grey_ball_1 room_3"
   - Now I am holding an object, which satisfies constraint 9.
4. Go to green_door_2 (which connects room_3 and room_4): "gotodoor green_door_2 room_3 room_4"
5. Toggle it to unlock it: "toggle green_door_2"
6. Go to room_4 via green_door_2: "gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_2"
7. Drop grey_ball_1 in room_4: "drop grey_ball_1 room_4"
   - Now "grey_ball_1 is in room_4", which is one of the conditions for constraint 6.
8. Go to green_door_1 (which connects room_2 and room_4): "gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2"
9. Toggle it to unlock it: "toggle green_door_1"
   - Now "green_door_1 is not locked", which satisfies constraint 2.
   - Also, "you are in front of green_door_1", which is one of the conditions for constraint 4.
10. Go to room_2 via green_door_1: "gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_1"
    - Now "you are in room_2", which is one of the conditions for constraint 9.
11. Go to yellow_box_1 in room_2: "gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_2"
12. Pick up yellow_box_1: "pick yellow_box_1 room_2"
13. Go to green_door_1: "gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4"
14. Go to room_4 via green_door_1: "gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1"
15. Drop yellow_box_1 in room_4: "drop yellow_box_1 room_4"
    - Now "yellow_box_1 is in room_4", which is needed for constraint 8.
16. Go back to room_2 via green_door_1: "gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_1"
17. Go to blue_door_1 (which connects room_1 and room_2): "gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1"
    - Now "you are in front of blue_door_1", which satisfies constraint 7.
    - Since "yellow_box_1 is in room_4", this fully satisfies constraint 8.
18. Toggle blue_door_1 to unlock it: "toggle blue_door_1"
19. Go to room_1 via blue_door_1: "gotoroom room_2 room_1 blue_door_1"
    - Now "you are in room_1", which satisfies constraint 3.
    - Since I was in front of green_door_1 earlier, this fully satisfies constraint 4.
20. Go to blue_box_1 in room_1: "gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1"
21. Pick up blue_box_1: "pick blue_box_1 room_1"
22. Go to blue_door_1: "gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2"
23. Go to room_2 via blue_door_1: "gotoroom room_1 room_2 blue_door_1"
24. Go to green_door_1: "gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4"
25. Go to room_4 via green_door_1: "gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1"
26. Go to green_door_2: "gotodoor green_door_2 room_4 room_3"
27. Go to room_3 via green_door_2: "gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_2"
28. Drop blue_box_1 in room_3: "drop blue_box_1 room_3"
    - Now "blue_box_1 is in room_3", which satisfies constraint 10.
29. Go to purple_door_1: "gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_1"
    - Now "you are in front of purple_door_1", which satisfies constraint 5.
    - Since "grey_ball_1 is in room_4", this fully satisfies constraint 6.
30. Go back to green_door_2: "gotodoor green_door_2 room_3 room_4"
31. Go to room_4 via green_door_2: "gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_2"
32. Go to green_door_1: "gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2"
33. Go to room_2 via green_door_1: "gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_1"
34. Go to blue_door_1: "gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1"

Now, let's check if all the constraints are satisfied:

1. "purple_door_1 is locked" in every state: Yes, we never toggle purple_door_1.
2. "green_door_1 is not locked" in at least one state: Yes, we do this in step 9.
3. "you are in room_1" in at least one state: Yes, we do this in step 19.
4. Before "you are in room_1", either "you are in room_4" or "you are in front of green_door_1": Yes, we are in front of green_door_1 in step 9.
5. "you are in front of purple_door_1" in at least one state: Yes, we do this in step 29.
6. Before "you are in front of purple_door_1", either "you are holding green_ball_1" or "grey_ball_1 is in room_4": Yes, grey_ball_1 is in room_4 from step 7.
7. "you are in front of blue_door_1" in at least one state: Yes, we do this in steps 17 and 34.
8. Before "you are in front of blue_door_1", "yellow_box_1 is in room_4": Yes, we ensure this in step 15.
9. "you are in room_2" or "you are holding some object" in at least one state: Yes, we hold grey_ball_1 in step 3, and we are in room_2 in step 10.
10. "blue_box_1 is in room_3" in at least one state: Yes, we ensure this in step 28.

And for the goal: "There is a door d such that 'The following conditions are all true: "d is blue", "room_1 and room_2 are connected via d", "you are in front of d", "d is not locked"'": Yes, after step 34, we are in front of blue_door_1, which is blue, connects room_1 and room_2, and is unlocked.

So the above plan satisfies all the constraints and achieves the goal!

Actually let me check once more:

Step 34 is: Go to blue_door_1: "gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1"

But after this, I end up in front of blue_door_1 from room_2, not from room_1. The goal states "room_1 and room_2 are connected via d", which is correct. But to be clear, I'm in room_2. 

Looking back at the original goal, let's be precise: "There is a door d such that 'The following conditions are all true: "d is blue", "room_1 and room_2 are connected via d", "you are in front of d", "d is not locked"'"

Since blue_door_1 connects room_1 and room_2, and it's blue, and it's unlocked, and I'm in front of it, then I've satisfied the goal. It doesn't matter which room I'm in, as long as I'm in front of the blue door that connects room_1 and room_2, and that door is unlocked.

If we want to be more precise, after step 34, I'm in room_2 and in front of blue_door_1, which connects room_2 to room_1.

OK let me just write out the final plan to make sure I have it right:

```
gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_3
pick grey_ball_1 room_3
gotodoor green_door_2 room_3 room_4
toggle green_door_2
gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_2
drop grey_ball_1 room_4
gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2
toggle green_door_1
gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_1
gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_2
pick yellow_box_1 room_2
gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4
gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1
drop yellow_box_1 room_4
gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_1
gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1
toggle blue_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_1 blue_door_1
gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1
pick blue_box_1 room_1
gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2
gotoroom room_1 room_2 blue_door_1
gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4
gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1
gotodoor green_door_2 room_4 room_3
gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_2
drop blue_box_1 room_3
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_1
gotodoor green_door_2 room_3 room_4
gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_2
gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2
gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_1
gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1
```

This final plan should satisfy all the constraints and achieve the goal.
