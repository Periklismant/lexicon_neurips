Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. The goal is to get in front of a yellow door that's unlocked. Let me start by understanding the initial state and the constraints.

First, the initial state: the agent is in room_1. There are several doors, all locked. The yellow door is yellow_door_1, which connects room_2 and room_4. But the agent is in room_1. So to reach the yellow door, the agent needs to move through other rooms.

Looking at the doors: room_1 is connected to room_2 via grey_door_1 and to room_3 via purple_door_1. Both are locked. So the first step is to unlock one of these doors to move out of room_1. But to unlock a door (toggle), the agent needs to be in front of it. However, to get in front of a door, there must be no object blocking that position. Let's check the objects in room_1: yellow_ball_1, green_box_1, blue_ball_1. These objects might be blocking the doors. Wait, the doors' positions could be blocked by objects. So the agent needs to check if the path to the door is blocked.

In room_1, the doors are grey_door_1 (connecting to room_2) and purple_door_1 (connecting to room_3). So, for example, to go to grey_door_1 in room_1, the agent must ensure that there's no object blocking it. If there's an object in front of grey_door_1 in room_1, then the agent can't go there. But how do we know if an object is blocking? The problem states that the "goto door" action is only possible if there's no object blocking the position in front of the door in the current room.

Looking at the initial state in room_1: there are three objects. If any of these are in front of the doors, then the agent can't go to the door. But how do we determine where the objects are placed relative to the doors? The problem description doesn't specify the exact positions of the objects, only which room they're in. Hmm, this is a bit ambiguous. But maybe the assumption is that unless specified, the objects are not blocking the doors. Or perhaps the doors are not blocked unless there's an object in front. Since the initial state doesn't mention any doors being blocked, we can assume that the doors are not blocked by objects. So the agent can go to the door positions as long as they are in the same room.

Wait, the preconditions for "goto door" are: you are in a room connected by door d, and no object is blocking the position in front of d in the current room. So even if the agent is in room_1, to go to grey_door_1 (which connects room_1 and room_2), the position in front of grey_door_1 in room_1 must not be blocked. If there's an object there, the agent can't go. But in room_1, the objects are yellow_ball_1, green_box_1, blue_ball_1. But we don't know their exact positions. The problem statement doesn't specify that any of these are blocking the doors. So maybe it's safe to assume they aren't, so the agent can go to the doors.

But wait, the initial state may have objects blocking the doors. Since it's not specified, perhaps the default is that they are not blocking. So the agent can proceed.

So the plan could be: the agent is in room_1. To unlock a door, they need to toggle it, which requires being in front of it. But all doors are locked initially. So first, the agent needs to go to a door in their current room (room_1 has grey_door_1 and purple_door_1), then toggle it to unlock. Then they can go through the door to another room.

But the goal is to be in front of a yellow door that's unlocked. The yellow door is yellow_door_1, which connects room_2 and room_4. So the agent needs to reach room_2 or room_4 to be in front of yellow_door_1.

Let's outline the steps:

1. From room_1, go to either grey_door_1 or purple_door_1. Let's pick grey_door_1 first.

But grey_door_1 is in room_1. So:

Action: gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2

But wait, the syntax is "gotodoor d r1 r2", where d is the door, r1 and r2 are the connected rooms. So to go to grey_door_1 from room_1, the correct command is "gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2".

Then toggle grey_door_1 to unlock it.

After that, the agent can use "gotoroom room_1 room_2 grey_door_1" to move to room_2.

Once in room_2, the yellow_door_1 connects room_2 to room_4. But yellow_door_1 is locked. So the agent needs to go to yellow_door_1 in room_2, toggle it to unlock, and then they can be in front of it while it's unlocked.

But the goal requires that the agent is in front of a yellow door that's not locked. So after unlocking yellow_door_1, the agent can be in front of it, and that would satisfy the goal.

Wait, but the goal is to have a door d where d is yellow, the agent is in front of d, and d is not locked. So the agent can be in front of yellow_door_1 after unlocking it.

So the steps would be:

1. In room_1, go to grey_door_1.
2. Toggle grey_door_1 to unlock it.
3. Move to room_2 via grey_door_1.
4. In room_2, go to yellow_door_1 (connects to room_4).
5. Toggle yellow_door_1 to unlock it.
6. Now, the agent is in front of yellow_door_1 (since they just toggled it), which is yellow and unlocked. So the goal is achieved.

Wait, but after toggling, the agent is still in front of the door, right? Because the toggle action's effect is just to lock/unlock the door. The agent's position doesn't change. So after step 5, the agent is in front of yellow_door_1, which is now unlocked. So steps 1-5 would achieve the goal.

But let's check the preconditions:

Step 1: gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2. The agent is in room_1, which is connected via grey_door_1. The position in front of the door in room_1 is not blocked (assuming). So possible.

Step 2: toggle grey_door_1. Precondition: must be in front of it. Yes, after step 1, the agent is in front of grey_door_1. Toggling it will unlock it.

Step 3: gotoroom room_1 room_2 grey_door_1. Preconditions: in room_1, adjacent to room_2 (which they are), door is unlocked (yes, after step 2). So possible. After this action, the agent is in room_2, not in front of any object/door.

Step 4: gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_4. The agent is in room_2, which is connected to room_4 via yellow_door_1. Check if the position is blocked. In room_2, there's green_ball_1 and blue_box_1. If they are not blocking the door, then possible. Assuming they are not, the agent can go to the door.

Step 5: toggle yellow_door_1. Now, the door is unlocked. The agent is in front of it. So the goal is achieved.

This seems like a valid plan. Let's check the steps:

Actions:

1. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2
2. toggle grey_door_1
3. gotoroom room_1 room_2 grey_door_1
4. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_4
5. toggle yellow_door_1

This would result in the agent being in front of yellow_door_1 (which is yellow) and it's now unlocked. So the goal is met.

But wait, the initial state says that all doors are locked. So step 2 unlocks grey_door_1, step 5 unlocks yellow_door_1.

Is there a shorter path? Let's see. The minimal steps needed:

- To get to yellow_door_1, the agent must be in room_2 or room_4. Since starting in room_1, the quickest path is room_1 -> room_2 via grey_door_1. Then room_2 to yellow_door_1.

But all doors start locked. So to unlock grey_door_1, steps 1-2 are needed. Then move to room_2 (step 3). Then steps 4-5 to unlock yellow_door_1.

Alternatively, could the agent go from room_1 to room_3 via purple_door_1? Let's see.

If the agent unlocks purple_door_1 instead:

1. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_3
2. toggle purple_door_1
3. gotoroom room_1 room_3 purple_door_1
Then in room_3, the doors are red_door_1 (connects to room_4) and purple_door_1. But red_door_1 is locked. So to get to room_4 from room_3, need to unlock red_door_1.

But yellow_door_1 is in room_2 and room_4. So maybe going through room_3 to room_4, then to yellow_door_1. But this seems longer. Let's compare:

Option 1 (grey_door_1 path):

5 steps.

Option 2 (purple_door_1 path):

1. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_3
2. toggle purple_door_1
3. gotoroom room_1 room_3 purple_door_1
4. gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_4
5. toggle red_door_1
6. gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_1
7. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_2
8. toggle yellow_door_1

That's 8 steps, which is longer. So the first option is better.

Thus, the initial plan of 5 steps is the optimal one.

Now, check if there are any constraints that I missed. The problem mentions constraints, but the user provided none beyond the usual preconditions. Wait, looking back, the user wrote: "A valid plan for the abovementioned problem must abide by the following constraints:" but then there's nothing listed. Wait, looking at the original problem statement:

"Provided a planning problem, consisting of an initial state of the world, a final goal and a set of constraints, your task is to provide a valid sequence of actions that solves the planning problem, i.e., bringing about the goal of the problem while satisfying all constraints."

But in the problem given, the constraints section is empty. The user might have made a formatting error, but in the provided input, after "The task is to bring about the following situation: ...", the next line is "A valid plan for the abovementioned problem must abide by the following constraints:" but then nothing follows. So perhaps there are no additional constraints beyond the usual action preconditions and effects. So the plan I outlined should be valid.

Another check: after step 5, the agent is in front of yellow_door_1, which is now unlocked. That satisfies the goal. So the plan is correct.

Now, write the plan in the required format.
