Okay, let's tackle this planning problem step by step. The goal is to get to a yellow door that's unlocked, and I need to be in front of it. The constraints are that I must be in front of the grey_door_1 at some point, and if I am, then either in that state or a later one, the grey door must be locked and I must be in front of the green_box_1.

Starting in room_1. The initial state has me there with some objects. The doors are all locked. So first, I need to figure out which doors are yellow. The yellow_door_1 is yellow, right? Because in the world objects, yellow_door_1 is listed with color yellow. So the target is to have yellow_door_1 unlocked and be in front of it.

But all doors start locked. So I need to unlock it. But to toggle a door, I need to be in front of it. But yellow_door_1 connects room_2 and room_4. Wait, the doors are: grey_door_1 connects room_1 and 2, purple_door_1 connects room_1 and 3, yellow_door_1 connects 2 and 4, red_door_1 connects 3 and 4. So yellow_door_1 is between room_2 and room_4.

To get to yellow_door_1, I need to be in room_2 or room_4. But starting in room_1. So path would be room_1 -> room_2 via grey_door_1, but grey_door_1 is locked. So I need to unlock it. But how? Because to toggle a door, I need to be in front of it. So first, I need to go to the grey_door_1 in room_1, then toggle it. But grey_door_1 is in room_1 and room_2. Wait, the door is between rooms. So to go to the door from room_1, I can use gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2. But preconditions for gotodoor: I must be in a room connected by the door, and no object is blocking the position in front of the door. Are there any objects blocking doors in room_1? Let's check the initial state. In room_1, there's yellow_ball_1, green_box_1, blue_ball_1. Are any of these blocking a door? The problem says that if an object is in front of a door, then the door is blocked. Wait, the effect of dropping an object can block a door. But initially, are any objects blocking doors? The initial state doesn't mention any blocking, so I assume doors are not blocked. So, can I go to grey_door_1 in room_1? Yes. So steps:

1. gotoobject green_box_1 room_1. Wait, but why? Maybe not necessary. Alternatively, since I need to eventually be in front of green_box_1 when grey_door_1 is locked. But maybe I can first go to the grey_door_1, unlock it, then go through to room_2, then proceed towards yellow_door_1. But there's a constraint: in some state, I must be in front of grey_door_1, and if that happens, then in that state or a later one, grey_door_1 must be locked and I'm in front of green_box_1.

So first, I need to be in front of grey_door_1. Let's say I do that. Then, after that, either in that state or later, I need to have grey_door_1 locked again and be in front of green_box_1. Wait, but initially grey_door_1 is locked. If I toggle it, it becomes unlocked. Then, if I toggle it again, it becomes locked again. So maybe after using the door, I can relock it, but that complicates things. Alternatively, the plan could be:

- Go to grey_door_1 (room_1 side), toggle to unlock. Then go through to room_2. But then, after that, perhaps return to room_1, toggle the door again to lock it, and then go to green_box_1. But that adds steps. But the constraint is that if I'm ever in front of grey_door_1, then at that state or a later one, grey_door_1 is locked and I'm in front of green_box_1. So if I go to grey_door_1 (in room_1), then in that state, the door is locked (since it's initially locked). Wait, the initial state says grey_door_1 is locked. So if I go to grey_door_1 in the initial state, then in that state, the door is locked, and I'm in front of it. But the constraint says that in any state where I'm in front of grey_door_1, then either that state or a later one must have grey_door_1 locked and me in front of green_box_1. Wait, but in the initial state, when I first go to grey_door_1, the door is locked. So in that state, the first part of the constraint is met (being in front of grey_door_1). Then, the condition requires that in that state (s) or after, grey_door_1 is locked and I'm in front of green_box_1. But in the initial state, when I first go to grey_door_1, the door is locked, but I'm not in front of green_box_1. So that state doesn't satisfy both. Therefore, after that, I need to have a state where grey_door_1 is locked and I'm in front of green_box_1. So maybe after unlocking the door and moving to room_2, I need to come back, lock the door again, and go to green_box_1. But how?

Alternatively, maybe the plan can be structured so that after going to grey_door_1 (which triggers the constraint), later, I relock it and go to the green_box_1. Let's outline the steps:

1. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2. Now, in front of grey_door_1, which is locked. This satisfies the first part of the constraint (being in front of it), but we need to ensure that in some state after, grey_door_1 is locked (it is now) and I'm in front of green_box_1. So after this, I need to eventually go to green_box_1. But how? Since after this step, the agent is in room_1. So they can then gotoobject green_box_1 room_1. So in the same room. So step 2: toggle grey_door_1 (to unlock it). Then step 3: gotoroom room_1 room_2 grey_door_1. Now in room_2. Then maybe proceed towards yellow_door_1. But then, after using the door, the grey_door_1 is unlocked. But the constraint requires that in the state where I was in front of grey_door_1 (step 1), then at that state or a later one, grey_door_1 is locked and I'm in front of green_box_1. But in step 1, the door is locked. Then, after step 2, it's unlocked. So in step 1's state, the door is locked. But in step 1's state, I'm not in front of green_box_1. So the constraint requires that either in step 1's state (which it's not) or some later state, both conditions hold. So after step 1, I can later lock the door again and be in front of green_box_1. For example:

After step 1 (goto grey_door_1), step 2: toggle (unlock it). Step3: gotoroom room_1 room_2. Then later, return to room_1, lock the door again (toggle), then goto green_box_1. But that might add steps. Alternatively, during the plan, after unlocking the door and going to room_2, perhaps the agent can return to room_1, relock the door, then go to green_box_1. Let's see.

But the main goal is to have a yellow door (yellow_door_1) that is unlocked and be in front of it. So steps to get there:

- From room_1, unlock grey_door_1 (go to door, toggle).
- Go to room_2.
- In room_2, go to yellow_door_1 (gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_4). But yellow_door_1 is locked. So need to toggle it. So:

- goto yellow_door_1 in room_2, toggle to unlock.
- Then gotoroom room_2 room_4 yellow_door_1. Now in room_4. Then, how to get to yellow_door_1 again? Wait, the goal is to be in front of a yellow door (d) that's unlocked. So once I'm in room_4, if I go to yellow_door_1 from room_4's side, then I can be in front of it, and if it's unlocked, that's the goal. But when I toggled it in room_2, it becomes unlocked. So when I'm in room_4, I can go to the door (yellow_door_1) from room_4's side, and it's already unlocked. So that would satisfy the goal.

But wait, the problem says the task is to have a door d that is yellow, the agent is in front of d, and d is not locked. So once yellow_door_1 is unlocked and the agent is in front of it (in either room_2 or room_4), that's the goal.

But let's outline the steps:

1. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2 (now in front of grey_door_1 in room_1). This meets the first constraint (being in front of grey_door_1). Then, after this, we need to ensure that in some state after this, grey_door_1 is locked and the agent is in front of green_box_1.

So after step 1:

2. toggle grey_door_1 (unlocks it). Now, the door is unlocked.

3. gotoroom room_1 room_2 grey_door_1 (move to room_2).

4. Now in room_2. Need to get to yellow_door_1. So gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_4.

5. toggle yellow_door_1 (unlock it).

6. gotoroom room_2 room_4 yellow_door_1 (now in room_4).

7. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_2 (now in front of yellow_door_1 in room_4). At this point, yellow_door_1 is unlocked, so this meets the goal (d is yellow, in front of it, and unlocked). But also, need to handle the constraints.

But wait, the constraints require that in some state, the agent is in front of grey_door_1, which happens in step 1. Then, if that's the case, in that state or after, the agent must be in front of green_box_1 and grey_door_1 is locked. Currently, after step 3, the agent is in room_2. The green_box_1 is in room_1. So after completing the main goal steps, the agent is in room_4. To satisfy the constraint, the agent needs to return to room_1, lock the grey_door_1 again, and go to green_box_1.

So after step 7 (achieving the goal), but perhaps before that, the agent needs to go back to room_1, lock the grey_door_1, and go to green_box_1. Let's see.

But the plan needs to be optimal (shortest possible). So adding steps to return might make the plan longer. Alternatively, perhaps during the initial steps, after toggling the grey_door_1 (unlocking it), moving to room_2, then later returning to room_1, locking the door again, and going to green_box_1.

But how to fit that into the plan. Let's think:

After step 3 (in room_2), proceed to unlock yellow_door_1, go to room_4, then perhaps return to room_2, then back to room_1 via grey_door_1 (which is unlocked). Then lock grey_door_1 again, and go to green_box_1.

But that's adding steps. Let's outline:

1. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2 (front of grey_door_1 in room_1)
2. toggle grey_door_1 (now unlocked)
3. gotoroom room_1 room_2 grey_door_1 (now in room_2)
4. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_4
5. toggle yellow_door_1 (unlocked)
6. gotoroom room_2 room_4 yellow_door_1 (now in room_4)
7. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_2 (now in front of it; goal achieved?)

But the goal is to have a door d that is yellow, not locked, and agent in front. So step 7 meets that. However, the constraints require that after step 1, in some state after that, grey_door_1 is locked and agent is in front of green_box_1. So after step 1, the agent must at some point lock grey_door_1 again and be in front of green_box_1.

So steps after step 7:

8. gotoroom room_4 room_2 yellow_door_1 (back to room_2)
9. gotoroom room_2 room_1 grey_door_1 (using grey_door_1, which is unlocked)
10. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2 (front of it)
11. toggle grey_door_1 (lock it again)
12. gotoobject green_box_1 room_1

Now, after step 12, the agent is in front of green_box_1, and grey_door_1 is locked. This satisfies the constraint. So the total steps would be 12. But is there a shorter way?

Wait, maybe after step 3 (in room_2), before proceeding to unlock yellow_door_1, the agent can return to room_1, lock the door, and go to green_box_1. Let's see:

1. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2 (step 1)
2. toggle grey_door_1 (unlock, step 2)
3. gotoroom room_1 room_2 grey_door_1 (step3)
4. gotoroom room_2 room_1 grey_door_1 (back to room_1, step4)
5. toggle grey_door_1 (lock it again, step5)
6. gotoobject green_box_1 room_1 (step6)

Now, after step6, the constraint is satisfied: in the state after step6, grey_door_1 is locked and agent is in front of green_box_1. Then proceed to unlock grey_door_1 again to proceed to room_2 and onwards. But this adds steps. Let's count:

After step6, we have to unlock the door again:

7. toggle grey_door_1 (unlock)
8. gotoroom room_1 room_2 grey_door_1 (step8)
9. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_4 (step9)
10. toggle yellow_door_1 (step10)
11. gotoroom room_2 room_4 yellow_door_1 (step11)
12. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_2 (step12)

Now, step12 is the goal. So total steps 12. But the previous approach also required 12 steps. So which path is better?

Alternatively, is there a way to satisfy the constraint without returning? For example, during the initial steps, after unlocking grey_door_1 and moving to room_2, but then the constraint is triggered in step1. Then, after that, the agent must at some point have grey_door_1 locked and be in front of green_box_1. So maybe after achieving the main goal, the agent can go back and do that.

But the plan must be optimal (shortest possible). So maybe the steps can be combined.

Wait, perhaps after step 1 (goto grey_door_1), step 2: toggle to unlock. Then step3: go to room_2. Then step4: proceed to unlock yellow_door_1 and achieve the goal. Then, after that, return to room_1, lock the door, and go to green_box_1. But the problem is that the goal is achieved at step7, but the constraints require that after step1, the agent must have a state where grey_door_1 is locked and in front of green_box_1. So the plan must include that after step1, such a state occurs. So the steps to lock the door and go to green_box_1 must be after step1. So the agent must do that either before or after achieving the main goal. 

But if the main goal is achieved first, then the agent can return to room_1 to lock the door and go to green_box_1. But that would make the plan longer. Alternatively, after step1, unlock the door, go to room_2, then return to room_1, lock the door, go to green_box_1, then unlock the door again and proceed to achieve the main goal. But that adds more steps.

Hmm. Let's outline the steps again:

Option 1:

1. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2 (meet constraint)
2. toggle (unlock)
3. gotoroom room_1 room_2 (move to room2)
4. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room4
5. toggle (unlock yellow door)
6. gotoroom room2 room4 (move to room4)
7. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room4 room2 (now in front of yellow door, unlocked: goal achieved)
8. Now need to satisfy the constraint by going back, locking grey_door_1, and going to green_box_1.

But this requires steps 8-12, total 12 steps. Is there a shorter way?

Option 2:

After step1 (goto grey_door_1), do:

1. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room2
2. toggle (unlock)
3. gotoroom room1 room2
4. ... proceed to unlock yellow door, etc.
But then after achieving the goal, return to room1, lock the door, and go to green_box_1.

Alternatively, maybe the constraint can be satisfied by step1 itself. Because in step1, the agent is in front of grey_door_1, which is locked. Then, in step1's state, the door is locked, but the agent is not in front of green_box_1. So the constraint requires that in step1 or after, the agent is in front of green_box_1 and grey_door_1 is locked. So perhaps after step1, the agent can go to green_box_1 and then proceed. But how? Because after step1, the agent is in front of grey_door_1. To go to green_box_1, which is in room_1, they can just gotoobject green_box_1 room_1. But then after step1:

2. gotoobject green_box_1 room_1 (now in front of green_box_1, grey_door_1 is still locked (since step1 didn't toggle it)). Then in this state, the agent is in front of green_box_1 and grey_door_1 is locked. So this satisfies the constraint.

So the plan would be:

1. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room2 (constraint met here)
2. gotoobject green_box_1 room_1 (now in front of green_box_1, grey_door_1 remains locked)
3. toggle grey_door_1 (unlock)
4. gotoroom room1 room2
5. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room2 room4
6. toggle yellow_door_1 (unlock)
7. gotoroom room2 room4
8. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room4 room2 (now in front of unlocked yellow door, goal achieved)

This plan has 8 steps. Does this work?

Let's check:

- Step1: in front of grey_door_1, which is locked. The constraint requires that if this state exists, then in this state or later, grey_door_1 is locked and in front of green_box_1. After step1, step2: goto green_box_1. Now, in step2's state, grey_door_1 is still locked (since it's toggled in step3). So in step2, the agent is in front of green_box_1 and grey_door_1 is locked. Thus satisfying the constraint. 

Yes! That's smart. Because after step1, the agent goes to green_box_1 in step2, which satisfies the constraint. Then, proceed to unlock the grey_door_1 and go through. This way, the constraint is met with just two steps, and the rest proceeds as needed. This reduces the total steps.

So the steps would be:

1. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2
2. gotoobject green_box_1 room_1
3. toggle grey_door_1 (unlock)
4. gotoroom room_1 room_2 grey_door_1
5. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_4
6. toggle yellow_door_1 (unlock)
7. gotoroom room_2 room_4 yellow_door_1
8. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_2

Now, step8 puts the agent in front of yellow_door_1 (which is yellow and unlocked), meeting the goal. Total steps: 8.

Let's verify each step's preconditions:

1. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2: agent is in room_1, which is connected via grey_door_1. No objects blocking (initial state). Valid.

2. gotoobject green_box_1 room_1: agent is in room_1, green_box_1 is there. Valid.

3. toggle grey_door_1: agent is in front of grey_door_1 (wait, no. After step2, the agent is in front of green_box_1. So to toggle grey_door_1, the agent must be in front of it. So step3 cannot directly follow step2. This is a mistake. Oops.

Ah, right. After step2, the agent is in front of green_box_1, not the door. So to toggle the door again, the agent needs to go back to the door. So step3 can't be toggle grey_door_1 unless they are in front of it. So this plan is invalid.

So this approach doesn't work. So the previous idea is flawed. So back to the drawing board.

So after step1 (goto grey_door_1), step2 is to goto green_box_1. Then step3 would require going back to grey_door_1 to unlock it. So:

1. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2 (front of door)
2. gotoobject green_box_1 room_1 (now front of box)
3. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2 (again)
4. toggle grey_door_1 (unlock)
5. gotoroom room_1 room_2 grey_door_1
6. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_4
7. toggle yellow_door_1
8. gotoroom room_2 room_4 yellow_door_1
9. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_2

Now, step3 is needed to get back to the door to toggle it. That adds steps, making the plan 9 steps.

But maybe there's a better way. Let's think again.

After step1 (goto grey_door_1), the agent is in front of it. Then, toggle it (unlock), then goto green_box_1. But then, when you toggle the door, you have to be in front of it. So:

1. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room2 (front of door)
2. toggle grey_door_1 (unlock)
3. gotoobject green_box_1 room_1 (now in front of box)
4. gotoroom room_1 room2 grey_door_1 (move to room2)
5. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room2 room4
6. toggle yellow_door_1 (unlock)
7. gotoroom room2 room4 yellow_door_1
8. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room4 room2

Now, this plan has 8 steps. Let's check the constraints:

- Step1: in front of grey_door_1, which is locked (initially). Then in step2, toggle to unlock. So after step1, the door was locked. The constraint requires that in the state where agent is in front of grey_door_1 (step1), then at that state or later, grey_door_1 is locked and agent is in front of green_box_1.

In step1's state, grey_door_1 is locked. But agent is not in front of green_box_1. So the requirement is that at some later state, grey_door_1 is locked and agent is in front of green_box_1. However, in step2, the door is unlocked. So to satisfy the constraint, the agent must have a later state where the door is locked again. So after step2, the door is unlocked. So steps after step2 need to relock the door and go to green_box_1. But this complicates things. 

So in this plan, after step2 (toggle unlock), the door is unlocked. The agent then goes to green_box_1 (step3). Then moves to room2. So grey_door_1 is now unlocked. But the constraint requires that after step1 (where the door was locked and agent was in front), there must be a state where the door is locked and agent is in front of green_box_1. Since the door was unlocked in step2, the agent must lock it again and then be in front of green_box_1. But how? Let's see:

Alternative approach:

1. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room2 (step1: front of door, locked)
2. toggle grey_door_1 (unlocks it, step2)
3. gotoobject green_box_1 room_1 (step3)
4. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room2 (step4)
5. toggle grey_door_1 (locks it, step5)
6. Now, in front of grey_door_1, locked. Then, goto green_box_1 again? But step3 was already in front of green_box_1. Hmm. Or after step5, the agent is in front of grey_door_1, which is locked. But then, the constraint requires that after step1, there's a state where grey_door_1 is locked and agent is in front of green_box_1. So step3 would be such a state: agent is in front of green_box_1, but grey_door_1 was unlocked at that point. No. So this doesn't work. 

This is getting complicated. Let's try to re-express the constraints:

The constraint is:

If at any state s, the agent is in front of grey_door_1, then in s or some state after s, both grey_door_1 is locked and agent is in front of green_box_1.

So, the only time the agent is in front of grey_door_1 is step1. So the constraint requires that in step1 or after, there must be a state where grey_door_1 is locked and agent is in front of green_box_1.

But in step1, grey_door_1 is locked, but agent is not in front of green_box_1. So after step1, there must be a state where grey_door_1 is locked and agent is in front of green_box_1.

So after step1, the agent can unlock the door (step2), go to room2, and proceed to the goal. Then, after achieving the goal, come back to room1, lock the door again, and go to green_box_1.

But that's adding steps. Let's outline:

1. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room2 (step1)
2. toggle grey_door_1 (unlock, step2)
3. gotoroom room1 room2 (step3)
4. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room2 room4 (step4)
5. toggle yellow_door_1 (unlock, step5)
6. gotoroom room2 room4 (step6)
7. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room4 room2 (step7: goal achieved)
8. gotoroom room4 room2 (step8)
9. gotoroom room2 room1 grey_door_1 (step9: back to room1)
10. gotodoor grey_door_1 room1 room2 (step10)
11. toggle grey_door_1 (lock, step11)
12. gotoobject green_box_1 room1 (step12)

Now, this meets the constraint. But the plan length is 12 steps. But maybe there's a shorter way.

Alternative plan:

After step1, the agent is in front of grey_door_1 (locked). Then, go to green_box_1 (step2). Then, unlock the door (but how, since you need to be in front of it to toggle. So:

1. gotodoor grey_door_1 room1 room2 (step1)
2. gotoobject green_box_1 room1 (step2)
3. gotodoor grey_door_1 room1 room2 (step3)
4. toggle grey_door_1 (unlock, step4)
5. gotoroom room1 room2 (step5)
6. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room2 room4 (step6)
7. toggle yellow_door_1 (step7)
8. gotoroom room2 room4 (step8)
9. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room4 room2 (step9)

Now, after step9, the goal is achieved. But after step4, grey_door_1 is unlocked. To satisfy the constraint, we need to have grey_door_1 locked again and agent in front of green_box_1. So after step9, agent can return:

10. gotoroom room4 room2 (step10)
11. gotoroom room2 room1 grey_door_1 (step11)
12. gotodoor grey_door_1 room1 room2 (step12)
13. toggle grey_door_1 (lock, step13)
14. gotoobject green_box_1 room1 (step14)

Now the plan is 14 steps, which is longer.

This is getting too long. Let's think differently. What if after step1 (goto grey_door_1), the agent toggles it to unlock (step2), then goes to room2 (step3), then proceeds to unlock yellow_door_1, achieve the goal, and then returns to room1 to lock grey_door_1 and go to green_box_1. But the plan has to include those steps. 

Alternatively, maybe the constraint can be satisfied during the plan's execution. For example:

- After step1 (goto grey_door_1), the agent is in front of it (locked). Then, in step2, toggle (unlock), step3 go to room2. Later, after achieving the goal, agent returns to room1, toggles the door to lock it (stepN), then goes to green_box_1 (stepN+1). This way, after step1, there is a later state where grey_door_1 is locked and agent is in front of green_box_1.

So the steps would be:

1. gotodoor grey_door_1 room1 room2 (step1)
2. toggle (unlock, step2)
3. gotoroom room1 room2 (step3)
4. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room2 room4 (step4)
5. toggle (unlock, step5)
6. gotoroom room2 room4 (step6)
7. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room4 room2 (step7: goal achieved)
8. gotoroom room4 room2 (step8)
9. gotoroom room2 room1 grey_door_1 (step9)
10. gotodoor grey_door_1 room1 room2 (step10)
11. toggle (lock, step11)
12. gotoobject green_box_1 room1 (step12)

This plan has 12 steps. Now, the constraint is satisfied in step12: grey_door_1 is locked, agent is in front of green_box_1. 

This plan meets all the requirements. But is this the shortest possible? Let's see if steps can be optimized.

For example, after step7 (goal achieved), the agent is in room4 in front of yellow_door_1. To return to room1:

Steps 8: gotoroom room4 room2 (through yellow_door_1)
Steps9: gotoroom room2 room1 (through grey_door_1, which is unlocked)
Steps10: gotodoor grey_door_1 room1 room2 (to toggle it)
Steps11: toggle to lock
Steps12: goto green_box_1.

Is there a way to save steps? For instance, after step7, can the agent go directly to room1 from room4? But room4 is connected to room3 via red_door_1. But red_door_1 is locked initially. So to go to room3, the agent would need to unlock it. That complicates things. So no, the only way back is through room2.

Thus, this plan of 12 steps seems necessary. 

But wait, in step7, the agent is in front of yellow_door_1 in room4, which meets the goal. The rest of the steps are to satisfy the constraint. Is there a way to satisfy the constraint earlier in the plan to avoid extra steps?

After step1 (goto grey_door_1), the agent could toggle it to unlock (step2), then go to green_box_1 (step3), which is in room1. But after step3, the agent is in front of green_box_1. Then, in step4, gotodoor grey_door_1 again, toggle to lock (step4), and then proceed. But this way, the constraint is satisfied after step4 and step3. Let's see:

1. gotodoor grey_door_1 room1 room2 (step1)
2. toggle (unlock, step2)
3. gotoobject green_box_1 room1 (step3)
4. gotodoor grey_door_1 room1 room2 (step4)
5. toggle (lock, step5)
6. Now, grey_door_1 is locked, and agent is in front of it. But the constraint requires that in some state after step1, grey_door_1 is locked and agent is in front of green_box_1. So step3 is such a state (agent in front of green_box_1, but grey_door_1 is unlocked). So that doesn't work. 

No, because in step3, grey_door_1 is unlocked. So step5 locks it again. Then, after step5, agent is in front of grey_door_1 (locked), and then they can go to green_box_1 again (step6):

6. gotoobject green_box_1 room1 (step6)

Now, in step6, agent is in front of green_box_1 and grey_door_1 is locked (after step5). So this satisfies the constraint. Then proceed to unlock grey_door_1 again:

7. toggle grey_door_1 (unlock, step7)
8. gotoroom room1 room2 (step8)
9. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room2 room4 (step9)
10. toggle (unlock, step10)
11. gotoroom room2 room4 (step11)
12. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room4 room2 (step12)

Now, the plan has 12 steps. So this is similar to the previous plan. 

Comparing the two options, both require 12 steps. 

But the initial approach of going back to lock the door and go to green_box_1 after achieving the goal is 12 steps. But perhaps there's a way to interleave steps to satisfy the constraint earlier.

Alternatively, during the initial steps:

1. gotodoor grey_door_1 room1 room2 (step1)
2. toggle (unlock, step2)
3. gotoroom room1 room2 (step3)
4. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room2 room4 (step4)
5. toggle (unlock, step5)
6. gotoroom room2 room4 (step6)
7. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room4 room2 (step7: goal achieved)
8. gotoroom room4 room2 (step8)
9. gotoroom room2 room1 grey_door_1 (step9)
10. toggle grey_door_1 (step10: lock)
11. gotoobject green_box_1 room1 (step11)

Wait, after step9, the agent is back in room1. But to toggle grey_door_1, they need to be in front of it. So step10: gotodoor grey_door_1 room1 room2 (step10)
11. toggle (lock, step11)
12. gotoobject green_box_1 (step12)

So again, 12 steps. 

Hmm. It seems that regardless of the approach, satisfying the constraint after step1 requires additional steps, leading to a 12-step plan. But maybe there's a smarter way. 

Wait, what if after achieving the goal (step7), the agent is in front of yellow_door_1 in room4. Then, the agent can proceed to drop an object there, but that's not required. Or perhaps, the agent can go back to room1 via a different path. But all other doors are locked. The red_door_1 connects room3 and room4, but it's initially locked. So unless the agent can unlock it, which would require going to room3 and toggling it. But room3 is connected to room1 via purple_door_1, which is also locked. So no, the only way back is through room2.

Therefore, the optimal plan must be 12 steps. But perhaps I'm missing a shortcut. Let's think again.

The agent needs to satisfy the constraint only once: that after being in front of grey_door_1 (step1), there exists a state where grey_door_1 is locked and agent is in front of green_box_1. So if after achieving the goal, the agent returns to room1, locks the door, and goes to green_box_1, that's sufficient. 

So the steps are:

1. gotodoor grey_door_1 room1 room2 (step1)
2. toggle (unlock, step2)
3. gotoroom room1 room2 (step3)
4. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room2 room4 (step4)
5. toggle (unlock, step5)
6. gotoroom room2 room4 (step6)
7. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room4 room2 (step7: goal met)
8. gotoroom room4 room2 (step8)
9. gotoroom room2 room1 grey_door_1 (step9)
10. gotodoor grey_door_1 room1 room2 (step10)
11. toggle (lock, step11)
12. gotoobject green_box_1 room1 (step12)

This is 12 steps. But maybe steps 8-9 can be merged. Wait, step7 is in front of yellow_door_1 in room4. To return to room2, the agent must use gotoroom room4 room2 yellow_door_1. But that's already in step7's effect. Wait, after step7, the agent is in front of yellow_door_1 in room4. To move back to room2, they need to perform gotoroom room4 room2 yellow_door_1. So step8 is gotoroom room4 room2 yellow_door_1 (step8). Then step9: gotoroom room2 room1 grey_door_1 (since grey_door_1 is unlocked). Step10: gotodoor grey_door_1 room1 room2. Step11: toggle to lock. Step12: goto green_box_1.

Yes, that's correct. So 12 steps.

Is there a way to reduce the steps? For example, after step9 (back in room1), can the agent lock the door and go to green_box_1 in fewer steps?

After step9, the agent is in room1. To lock grey_door_1, they need to be in front of it. So step10: gotodoor grey_door_1 room1 room2. Step11: toggle to lock. Step12: goto green_box_1. So steps 10-12 are required. No way to shorten that.

Therefore, the minimal plan is 12 steps. But wait, perhaps the agent can lock the door and go to green_box_1 without extra steps. For example, after step9 (room1), can they goto green_box_1, which is in room1, but how to lock the door then? They can't lock the door unless they're in front of it. So no.

Thus, this 12-step plan is the minimal.
