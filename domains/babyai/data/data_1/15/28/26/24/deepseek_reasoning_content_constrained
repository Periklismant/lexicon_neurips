Okay, let's tackle this planning problem step by step. First, I need to understand the goal and the constraints. The final goal is to have a yellow door d that connects room_4 and room_2, be in front of it, and have it unlocked. The constraints are that at some point, the agent must be in front of blue_door_1, and whenever that happens, the agent must have been holding an object before that state.

Starting from the initial state: the agent is in room_1. All doors are locked. The doors are blue_door_1 (connects room_1 and room_2), blue_door_2 (room_1 and room_3), yellow_door_1 (room_2 and room_4), and purple_door_1 (room_3 and room_4). The goal door is yellow, connects room_4 and room_2â€”so that's yellow_door_1. So the agent needs to be in front of yellow_door_1 in room_2 or room_4, and have it unlocked.

But yellow_door_1 is initially locked. So the agent must unlock it. To toggle a door, they need to be in front of it. But to get to yellow_door_1, which is between room_2 and room_4, the agent needs to get to room_2 first. However, the doors connecting room_1 to room_2 (blue_door_1) and room_1 to room_3 (blue_door_2) are locked. So the agent needs to unlock those doors first. Wait, but how? Because to unlock a door, you have to be in front of it and toggle it. But the agent starts in room_1. So maybe they need to go to the doors in room_1 first. Wait, the doors are in the room connections. So blue_door_1 is in both room_1 and room_2. So the agent can go to blue_door_1 from room_1. But the problem is, to go to a door, they need to be in a room connected by that door. Since the agent is in room_1, they can go to blue_door_1 (which connects room_1 and room_2), but the door is locked. Wait, but the goto door action's precondition is that the agent is in a room that the door connects, and there's no object blocking the position in front of the door. Are there any objects blocking doors in room_1? The initial state doesn't mention any objects in room_1 except the agent. So the agent can go to blue_door_1 in room_1. Then, they can toggle it to unlock it. But to toggle, they must be in front of it. So first, goto blue_door_1, then toggle it. But according to the constraints, if the agent is in front of blue_door_1 at any state, there must be an earlier state where they were holding an object. So before going to blue_door_1, the agent must have held an object. But initially, the agent isn't holding anything. So they need to pick up an object. But there are no objects in room_1. The boxes and balls are in room_2 and room_4. So the agent needs to get to room_2 or room_3 to get an object, but the doors are locked. Wait, this seems like a catch-22. Because the agent can't get to the other rooms without unlocking the doors, but to unlock the doors, they need to be in front of them. But in room_1, the blue doors are locked. Wait, but can the agent go to the door in room_1, even if it's locked? Because the "goto door" action only requires that the agent is in a room connected by the door and that there's no object blocking. Since the door is locked, but the agent is in room_1, can they go in front of blue_door_1 in room_1? According to the preconditions for "gotodoor d r1 r2", the agent can go to the door as long as they are in a room connected by the door (which they are, room_1) and no object is blocking. Since there's no object blocking in room_1, they can go to blue_door_1. Then, they can toggle it. But the constraint says that whenever they are in front of blue_door_1, they must have held an object before. So the agent must have picked up an object before going to blue_door_1. But how? Because there are no objects in room_1. So maybe the agent has to go to another door first. Wait, maybe there's another path. Let's think.

Wait, the agent starts in room_1. They need to get to room_2 to pick up an object. But to get to room_2, they need to use blue_door_1, which is locked. So the steps would be: goto blue_door_1 in room_1, toggle it (unlock), then gotoroom room_1 room_2 blue_door_1. Then in room_2, they can pick up an object. But the problem is, to toggle blue_door_1, the agent needs to be in front of it. But when they first goto blue_door_1, they are in front of it. Then, they can toggle it. But according to the constraint, if the agent is in front of blue_door_1 at any time, they must have held an object before. So in the initial steps, when they first go to blue_door_1, they haven't held any object yet. That would violate the constraint. Therefore, they must have held an object before being in front of blue_door_1. But they can't get to an object without first unlocking the door. So this seems impossible. Hmm, maybe there's another way. Let's check the constraints again.

The constraint is: "If you are in front of blue_door_1 in some state, then there must be an earlier state where you were holding some object." So the agent must have held an object before any state where they are in front of blue_door_1. But in the initial state, they are in room_1. To unlock blue_door_1, they need to go to it in room_1, but that would require being in front of blue_door_1 before having held an object. Which violates the constraint. Therefore, the agent must first find a way to hold an object without needing to go through blue_door_1. Wait, but there's blue_door_2 connecting room_1 to room_3. Maybe the agent can go through there. Let's see. The blue_door_2 is also locked. So the agent can go to blue_door_2 in room_1, toggle it to unlock, then go to room_3. Then from room_3, perhaps go to room_4 via purple_door_1 (but it's locked), but the agent would need to unlock that door. But in room_3, there's purple_door_1 connecting to room_4. If the agent can get to room_3, then maybe they can go to room_4 via purple_door_1 after unlocking it. But room_4 has objects like purple_box_2 and green_ball_1. So in room_4, the agent can pick up an object, then return to room_1 via room_3, then go to blue_door_1 in room_1, but then they would have held an object before being in front of blue_door_1. Let's outline this possible path.

1. From room_1, goto blue_door_2 (connecting room_1 and room_3). But since the door is locked, can they go to it? The "gotodoor" action just requires being in a room connected by the door and no object blocking. So yes. So:

- gotodoor blue_door_2 room_1 room_3. Now, agent is in front of blue_door_2 in room_1. Then, toggle it to unlock. Now, blue_door_2 is unlocked.

- Then, gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_2. Now agent is in room_3. Now, in room_3, they can go to purple_door_1 (connects room_3 and room_4). But purple_door_1 is locked. So:

- gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_4. Toggle it to unlock.

- Then, gotoroom room_3 room_4 purple_door_1. Now in room_4. Here, there's purple_box_2 and green_ball_1 and red_ball_2. So pick up green_ball_1.

Then, return to room_3, then to room_1 via blue_door_2. Now, in room_1, the agent is holding green_ball_1. Now, go to blue_door_1 in room_1. But this would satisfy the constraint because the agent is holding green_ball_1 before going to blue_door_1. Wait, no. The sequence would be: after picking up the ball, return to room_1. Then, when they go to blue_door_1 in room_1, they are in front of it. But the constraint says that whenever they are in front of blue_door_1, they must have held an object before. Since they are currently holding green_ball_1 when they go to blue_door_1, does that count? Wait, the constraint says "if in some state you are in front of blue_door_1, then there must be an earlier state where you were holding some object." So even if you are holding it at the same time, but the prior state must have holding. Wait, but in the action sequence, when you perform gotodoor blue_door_1, you are in front of it. The prior action would be, for example, dropping the object or moving from another room. Hmm, maybe I need to structure the plan such that before any gotodoor blue_door_1 action, there was a pick action. Let's think.

Alternative plan: The agent goes from room_1 to room_3 via blue_door_2 (unlocking it), then to room_4 via purple_door_1 (unlocking it), picks up an object in room_4 (like green_ball_1), returns to room_1, then goes to blue_door_1 in room_1. At that point, the agent is in front of blue_door_1, and since they previously picked up the green_ball_1, that satisfies the constraint. But wait, when they return to room_1, they are still holding the green_ball_1, right? Because they picked it up and haven't dropped it. Then, when they go to blue_door_1, they are holding the ball. So the state before being in front of blue_door_1 would have them holding the object. So that meets the constraint.

Then, after being in front of blue_door_1, they can toggle it to unlock, then go to room_2. In room_2, they can drop the green_ball_1 if needed. Then proceed to yellow_door_1 (connecting room_2 and room_4). But yellow_door_1 is locked. So they need to go to it, toggle it. Then, go to room_4 via yellow_door_1. Wait, but the goal is to be in front of yellow_door_1 (which is the d in the goal) and have it unlocked. So maybe the agent can just unlock yellow_door_1 from room_2.

Wait, the goal is: there exists a door d that is yellow, connects room_4 and room_2, you are in front of d, and d is not locked. So the door is yellow_door_1. So the agent needs to be in front of yellow_door_1 in either room_2 or room_4, and the door must be unlocked.

So the plan steps could be:

1. Go from room_1 to room_3 via blue_door_2 (unlocking it).
2. From room_3 to room_4 via purple_door_1 (unlocking it).
3. In room_4, pick up green_ball_1.
4. Return to room_3, then to room_1.
5. Now in room_1, holding green_ball_1, go to blue_door_1 (this action would trigger the constraint, but since the agent is holding the ball, the constraint is satisfied because they were holding it before).
6. Toggle blue_door_1 to unlock.
7. Go to room_2 via blue_door_1.
8. In room_2, drop the green_ball_1 (if necessary, but maybe not needed).
9. Go to yellow_door_1 in room_2 (since it connects to room_4).
10. Toggle yellow_door_1 to unlock.
11. Now, the agent is in front of yellow_door_1 in room_2, which is unlocked. This satisfies the goal.

But the goal requires that the agent is in front of d (yellow_door_1) and d is unlocked. So step 10 and 11: after toggling, the door is unlocked, and the agent is in front of it. So step 10 is "toggle yellow_door_1", which unlocks it. Then, the agent is still in front of yellow_door_1. So the final state after step 10 would be in front of yellow_door_1, door unlocked. So that's the goal.

But wait, after toggling, the agent remains in front of the door. So the final action would be the toggle, which makes the door unlocked, and the agent is still in front of it. So that's the goal.

Now, let's check the constraints. The first constraint is that "you are in front of blue_door_1" must hold in at least one state. In the plan above, step 5 is "gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2". Then step 6 is toggle. So in that state, the agent is in front of blue_door_1. And before that, in step 3, the agent picked up green_ball_1, which is an object. So the constraint is satisfied because step 3 (holding) comes before step 5 (in front of blue_door_1).

Now, let's check if this plan is possible and optimal.

Let's outline the steps:

1. gotodoor blue_door_2 room_1 room_3
2. toggle blue_door_2
3. gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_2
4. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_4
5. toggle purple_door_1
6. gotoroom room_3 room_4 purple_door_1
7. gotoobject green_ball_1 room_4
8. pick green_ball_1 room_4
9. gotoroom room_4 room_3 purple_door_1
10. gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_2
11. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2
12. toggle blue_door_1
13. gotoroom room_1 room_2 blue_door_1
14. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_4
15. toggle yellow_door_1

After step 15, the agent is in front of yellow_door_1 in room_2, which is now unlocked. The goal is achieved.

But let's check if all preconditions are met.

Step 1: gotodoor blue_door_2 room_1 room_3. The agent is in room_1, which is connected via blue_door_2, and no object is blocking. Correct.

Step 2: toggle blue_door_2. Agent is in front of it. Correct.

Step 3: gotoroom from room_1 to room_3 via blue_door_2 (now unlocked). Correct.

Step 4: gotodoor purple_door_1 in room_3. Correct, since room_3 is connected to room_4 via purple_door_1. No blocking object.

Step 5: toggle purple_door_1. Now unlocked.

Step 6: gotoroom to room_4. Correct.

Step7: gotoobject green_ball_1 in room4. Agent is in room4, so correct.

Step8: pick green_ball_1. Agent is not holding anything, so correct.

Step9: go back to room3. Since purple_door_1 is unlocked, correct.

Step10: go back to room1 via blue_door_2 (unlocked). Correct.

Step11: gotodoor blue_door_1 in room1. Now, the agent is holding green_ball_1, but the action is allowed. The constraint is satisfied because the agent was holding the object before this step (picked in step8, still holding).

Step12: toggle blue_door_1. Now it's unlocked.

Step13: go to room2.

Step14: goto yellow_door_1 in room2. Agent is in room2, connected via yellow_door_1. No blocking.

Step15: toggle yellow_door_1. Now unlocked. Agent is in front of it.

This seems to work. Now, is this the shortest possible plan? Let's see if there's a shorter path.

Alternative approach: Maybe instead of going through room3 and room4, can the agent go directly to room2 via blue_door_1 by first picking an object in room2? But how? Because blue_door_1 is locked initially. The agent needs to unlock it first. But to unlock it, they need to be in front of it in room1. But to satisfy the constraint, they must have held an object before being in front of blue_door_1. But there's no objects in room1, so they can't pick any there. So the only way to get an object is to go to another room first. Hence, the path through room3 and room4 seems necessary.

Another alternative: Maybe use room_3 to get to room_4, but there's a ball in room4. Then return to room1, go to blue_door_1, unlock, then go to room2, unlock yellow_door_1. So the steps would be similar to the previous plan. But is there a shorter way?

Wait, after step 15, the agent is in front of yellow_door_1 in room2, and it's unlocked. The goal is satisfied. So the plan has 15 steps. Maybe there's a way to reduce steps.

Let me count the steps in the plan above:

1. gotodoor blue_door_2 room_1 room_3
2. toggle blue_door_2
3. gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_2
4. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_4
5. toggle purple_door_1
6. gotoroom room_3 room_4 purple_door_1
7. gotoobject green_ball_1 room_4
8. pick green_ball_1 room_4
9. gotoroom room_4 room_3 purple_door_1
10. gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_2
11. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2
12. toggle blue_door_1
13. gotoroom room_1 room_2 blue_door_1
14. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_4
15. toggle yellow_door_1

That's 15 actions. Can we optimize this?

After step8, the agent is holding green_ball_1. Then they go back to room3, room1. Then to blue_door_1. Instead of going back to room1, maybe they can go directly from room4 to room2 via yellow_door_1, but yellow_door_1 is locked. So they need to unlock it. But the agent is in room4, which is connected to room2 via yellow_door_1. So if they can get to yellow_door_1 from room4, unlock it, then go to room2. But to unlock yellow_door_1, they need to be in front of it. So in room4, they can go to yellow_door_1 (since room4 is connected to room2 via it), but the door is locked. But the agent is in room4. So:

Alternative steps after step6 (agent in room4):

7. gotoobject green_ball_1 room4
8. pick green_ball_1 room4
9. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room4 room2 (but door is locked; but gotodoor only requires being in a connected room and no blocking object. Since yellow_door_1 is locked, but the agent is in room4, they can go to it. Then toggle to unlock. Then go to room2. Then drop the ball. Then go to blue_door_1 in room2. But wait, room2 is connected to room1 via blue_door_1. But the agent needs to be in room1 to go to blue_door_1. Hmm, maybe this path isn't better.

Alternatively, after unlocking yellow_door_1 in room4, the agent can go to room2. Then, in room2, they can go to blue_door_1 (since room2 is connected to room1 via it). But blue_door_1 is locked. Wait, the agent is in room2. So they can go to blue_door_1 in room2, but to unlock it, they need to be in front of it. But blue_door_1 is locked. So in room2:

After entering room2 via yellow_door_1 (which would require unlocking it first), but how?

Wait, let's try this:

1. In room1, gotodoor blue_door_2, toggle it to unlock. Then go to room3, then unlock purple_door_1, go to room4. Pick up green_ball_1. Then in room4, go to yellow_door_1 (room4's side). Toggle it to unlock. Then go to room2 via yellow_door_1. Now, in room2, the agent is holding green_ball_1. Now, go to blue_door_1 in room2 (connecting to room1). But blue_door_1 is locked. So the agent can't go back to room1 unless they unlock it. But they are in room2. So they can goto blue_door_1 in room2, but it's locked. Toggle it (unlock). Then go to room1. Then, the constraint is that when they are in front of blue_door_1 (in room2), they must have held an object before. Since they picked up green_ball_1 in room4, that's before. Then, when they are in front of blue_door_1 in room2, the constraint is satisfied. But the constraint requires that in at least one state, the agent is in front of blue_door_1. So in this case, they are in front of blue_door_1 in room2, which counts. Then, they can toggle it, go to room1, and proceed. But how does this help with the goal?

Wait, the goal is to be in front of yellow_door_1 (d) in either room2 or room4, and it's unlocked. So in this path, after unlocking yellow_door_1 from room4, then going to room2 via yellow_door_1, the agent is in room2. They can then go to yellow_door_1 in room2 (which connects to room4) and be in front of it, and since it's unlocked, that satisfies the goal. So the steps would be:

After step8 (holding green_ball_1 in room4):

9. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room4 room2
10. toggle yellow_door_1 (unlocking it)
11. gotoroom room4 room2 yellow_door_1
12. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room2 room4
13. (now in front of yellow_door_1 in room2, which is unlocked)

But this may require fewer steps. Let's count:

Original steps:

15 steps.

Alternative path:

Steps:

1. gotodoor blue_door_2 room1 room3
2. toggle blue_door_2
3. gotoroom room1 room3 blue_door_2
4. gotodoor purple_door_1 room3 room4
5. toggle purple_door_1
6. gotoroom room3 room4 purple_door_1
7. gotoobject green_ball_1 room4
8. pick green_ball_1 room4
9. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room4 room2
10. toggle yellow_door_1
11. gotoroom room4 room2 yellow_door_1
12. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room2 room4
13. (now in front of it, unlocked)

But in this case, the agent is in front of yellow_door_1 in room2, which is unlocked. So steps 1-12, plus step12 is gotodoor. Then, is the toggle needed?

Wait, after step10, the door is unlocked, and the agent is in front of it in room4. Then step11 is moving to room2. Then step12 is gotodoor in room2. So after step10, the agent is in front of yellow_door_1 in room4, which is now unlocked. Then, they move to room2. Then, in room2, they need to go to yellow_door_1 again. So steps would be:

After step11, the agent is in room2. They need to go to yellow_door_1 in room2. So step12: gotodoor yellow_door_1 room2 room4. Now in front of it. The door is already unlocked (from step10). So the goal is achieved. So total steps would be 12.

But wait, the goal requires that the agent is in front of d (yellow_door_1) and d is unlocked. So step10: after toggling, the agent is in front of yellow_door_1 in room4, and the door is unlocked. So maybe that's sufficient. Because the goal doesn't specify which room the agent is in front of the door. So if the agent is in front of yellow_door_1 in room4, that's valid.

Wait, the door connects room4 and room2. So being in front of it in either room4 or room2 is acceptable. So after step10, the agent is in front of yellow_door_1 in room4, and it's unlocked. So that would satisfy the goal. Then, the plan can be shorter.

Let's adjust:

After step10 (toggle yellow_door_1 in room4), the agent is in front of it, and the door is unlocked. So that's the goal. So steps would be:

1. gotodoor blue_door_2 room1 room3
2. toggle blue_door_2
3. gotoroom room1 room3 blue_door_2
4. gotodoor purple_door_1 room3 room4
5. toggle purple_door_1
6. gotoroom room3 room4 purple_door_1
7. gotoobject green_ball_1 room4
8. pick green_ball_1 room4
9. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room4 room2
10. toggle yellow_door_1

Now, after step10, the agent is in front of yellow_door_1 in room4, which is now unlocked. The goal is achieved. So total steps: 10.

But wait, the constraint requires that the agent is in front of blue_door_1 in some state. In this plan, the agent never goes to blue_door_1. So this plan doesn't satisfy the first constraint. Therefore, this approach is invalid.

Ah, right. The constraint is that "you are in front of blue_door_1" must hold in at least one state. So the agent must go to blue_door_1 at some point. Hence, the earlier plan that includes steps to go to blue_door_1 is necessary.

So the first plan, with 15 steps, satisfies the constraints. But perhaps there's a shorter way to satisfy the constraints.

Alternative idea: After unlocking blue_door_2 and purple_door_1, going to room4 to pick up an object, then returning to room1, but then using blue_door_1. Let's see.

Steps:

1. gotodoor blue_door_2 room1 room3
2. toggle blue_door_2
3. gotoroom room1 room3 blue_door_2
4. gotodoor purple_door_1 room3 room4
5. toggle purple_door_1
6. gotoroom room3 room4 purple_door_1
7. pick green_ball_1 room4 (need to be in front of it first)
   - So before pick, need to gotoobject green_ball_1 room4. So step7: gotoobject, step8: pick.
8. gotoroom room4 room3 purple_door_1
9. gotoroom room3 room1 blue_door_2
10. gotodoor blue_door_1 room1 room2
11. toggle blue_door_1 (now unlocked)
12. gotoroom room1 room2 blue_door_1
13. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room2 room4
14. toggle yellow_door_1

Now, after step14, agent is in front of yellow_door_1 in room2, which is unlocked. This meets the goal. Now, the steps are 14. But also, step10 is gotodoor blue_door_1 in room1, which requires that the agent was holding an object before. The agent picked up green_ball_1 in step8, and still holds it until they drop it. So in step10, they are holding it, which satisfies the constraint. So steps:

1. gotodoor blue_door_2
2. toggle
3. gotoroom to room3
4. gotodoor purple_door_1
5. toggle
6. gotoroom to room4
7. gotoobject green_ball_1
8. pick
9. gotoroom to room3
10. gotoroom to room1
11. gotodoor blue_door_1
12. toggle
13. gotoroom to room2
14. gotodoor yellow_door_1
15. toggle

Wait, no. Steps 1-8: pick green_ball_1. Steps9-10: return to room1. Then step11: gotodoor blue_door_1. Then toggle (step12), then go to room2 (step13). Then gotodoor yellow_door_1 (step14), toggle (step15). So 15 steps.

But maybe after step13 (gotoroom to room2), the agent can directly go to yellow_door_1 in room2. But need to check if the door is locked. Yes, initially it's locked. So they need to toggle it. So steps are necessary.

So the minimal steps are 15. But perhaps there's a way to optimize.

Wait, when the agent is in room2 after unlocking blue_door_1, they can go to yellow_door_1. But yellow_door_1 is locked. So they need to toggle it. So steps 14 and 15.

Alternative approach: After unlocking blue_door_1 and entering room2, can the agent use the object they're holding to drop it somewhere, then go to yellow_door_1. But that might not help.

Alternatively, after picking up green_ball_1 in room4, the agent could drop it in room1 before going to blue_door_1. But then, when they go to blue_door_1, they are not holding it, but they have held it before, which satisfies the constraint.

So steps:

1. gotodoor blue_door_2 room1 room3
2. toggle
3. gotoroom room1 room3
4. gotodoor purple_door_1
5. toggle
6. gotoroom room3 room4
7. gotoobject green_ball_1
8. pick
9. gotoroom room4 room3
10. gotoroom room3 room1
11. drop green_ball_1 room1
12. gotodoor blue_door_1 room1 room2
13. toggle
14. gotoroom room1 room2
15. gotodoor yellow_door_1
16. toggle

Now, in this plan, step12 is gotodoor blue_door_1. The agent had held green_ball_1 (step8) before step12, so constraint is met. But this plan has 16 steps, which is longer. So not better.

Thus, the initial plan of 15 steps seems necessary. However, I need to check if there's a way to shorten it by combining steps.

Wait, after step6 (agent in room4), they can immediately pick up green_ball_1 if they are in front of it. But the agent needs to gotoobject green_ball_1 first. So steps7 and 8 are required.

Alternatively, if there's a way to pick up an object in room4 without going to it first. But no, the agent must be in front of it to pick.

Alternatively, after step6, if the agent is in room4, maybe there's another object closer. But in room4, there's purple_box_2, green_ball_1, and red_ball_2. They can pick any, but green_ball_1 is a ball, which might be easier to carry.

Alternatively, after step10, when returning to room1, the agent is holding green_ball_1. Then, when they go to blue_door_1 (step11), they are holding it. Then, they toggle blue_door_1 (step12), then go to room2 (step13). Then, in room2, they can drop the green_ball_1 (step14), then go to yellow_door_1 (step15), toggle (step16). But this adds steps. Not better.

So perhaps the initial 15-step plan is the optimal.

Now, let's check if all preconditions are met for each step.

1. gotodoor blue_door_2 room1 room3: agent in room1, connected via blue_door_2. Correct.

2. toggle blue_door_2: agent in front of it. Correct.

3. gotoroom room1 to room3 via blue_door_2: door is now unlocked. Correct.

4. gotodoor purple_door_1 room3 room4: agent in room3. Correct.

5. toggle purple_door_1: in front of it. Correct.

6. gotoroom room3 to room4 via purple_door_1: unlocked. Correct.

7. gotoobject green_ball_1 room4: agent in room4. Correct.

8. pick green_ball_1: not holding anything, in front of it. Correct.

9. gotoroom room4 to room3 via purple_door_1: unlocked. Correct.

10. gotoroom room3 to room1 via blue_door_2: unlocked. Correct.

11. gotodoor blue_door_1 room1 room2: agent in room1. Correct.

12. toggle blue_door_1: in front of it. Correct.

13. gotoroom room1 to room2 via blue_door_1: now unlocked. Correct.

14. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room2 room4: agent in room2. Correct.

15. toggle yellow_door_1: in front of it. Now unlocked. Correct.

Thus, the plan is valid and meets all constraints. Now, the number of steps is 15. Is there a shorter plan?

Alternative idea: Can the agent pick up an object in room4 and go directly to room2 via yellow_door_1 after unlocking it, thereby avoiding the need to go back to room1 and unlock blue_door_1? Let's see.

But the constraint requires being in front of blue_door_1. So the agent must go there at least once. So even if they unlock yellow_door_1 and go to room2 via room4, they still need to go to blue_door_1 in room1 or room2.

But if the agent is in room2, they can go to blue_door_1 (in room2) after unlocking yellow_door_1. Let's try:

Plan:

1. Unlock blue_door_2 and go to room3, then unlock purple_door_1 and go to room4.

2. Pick up green_ball_1.

3. Go to yellow_door_1 in room4, unlock it, go to room2.

4. Now in room2, go to blue_door_1 (room2 side), which is locked.

5. Toggle blue_door_1 to unlock it.

But this requires steps:

But when in room2, the agent can go to blue_door_1 (room2's side). To do that, they need to be in room2. So steps:

1. gotodoor blue_door_2 room1 room3
2. toggle
3. gotoroom room1 room3
4. gotodoor purple_door_1 room3 room4
5. toggle
6. gotoroom room3 room4
7. gotoobject green_ball_1 room4
8. pick
9. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room4 room2
10. toggle yellow_door_1
11. gotoroom room4 room2 yellow_door_1
12. gotodoor blue_door_1 room2 room1
13. toggle blue_door_1
14. (now in front of blue_door_1 in room2)

But the constraint requires being in front of blue_door_1 in some state. Step12 is gotodoor blue_door_1 in room2. Then step13 is toggle. So step12 satisfies the constraint. Also, before step12, the agent was holding green_ball_1 (picked in step8, still holding in step12). Thus, the constraint is met.

Then, after unlocking blue_door_1 in room2, the agent can go to room1 if needed, but that's not necessary. The goal is to be in front of yellow_door_1 (which was already done in step9-10). Wait, no. After step10, the agent is in front of yellow_door_1 in room4, which is now unlocked. So after step10, the agent is in front of yellow_door_1, which is unlocked. So the goal is already achieved. But wait, the agent needs to be in front of d (yellow_door_1) and d is unlocked. So after step10, they are in front of it in room4. So steps 1-10 would suffice. But the agent is in front of blue_door_1 in room2 (step12). But the constraint is satisfied because in step12, they are in front of blue_door_1, and before that, they were holding green_ball_1 (steps8-12). But in this plan, the agent doesn't need to go to blue_door_1. Wait, the constraint is that the agent must be in front of blue_door_1 in at least one state. So in this alternative plan, the agent is in front of blue_door_1 in room2 (step12), which satisfies the constraint. And since they were holding green_ball_1 in step8, which is before step12, the constraint is met. Then, the goal is achieved in step10. So the steps would be:

1. gotodoor blue_door_2 room1 room3
2. toggle blue_door_2
3. gotoroom room1 room3
4. gotodoor purple_door_1 room3 room4
5. toggle purple_door_1
6. gotoroom room3 room4
7. gotoobject green_ball_1 room4
8. pick green_ball_1 room4
9. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room4 room2
10. toggle yellow_door_1 (now unlocked, agent in front of it)
11. (goal achieved here)
12. gotoroom room4 room2 yellow_door_1
13. gotodoor blue_door_1 room2 room1
14. toggle blue_door_1 (now unlocked)

Wait, but after step10, the agent is in front of yellow_door_1 in room4, which is unlocked. So the goal is already met. However, the constraint requires being in front of blue_door_1 in some state. So steps13 and 14 are necessary. But the agent must have the step of being in front of blue_door_1. So after step10, the agent can proceed to step13: goto blue_door_1 in room2. So steps1-13, step14: toggle. But the goal is already achieved in step10, but the agent must also satisfy the constraint. So in this plan, steps:

1-10: goal achieved.

But to satisfy the constraint, steps13 (gotodoor blue_door_1) is required. So steps:

1. gotodoor blue_door_2 room1 room3
2. toggle
3. gotoroom room1 room3
4. gotodoor purple_door_1
5. toggle
6. gotoroom room3 room4
7. gotoobject green_ball_1
8. pick
9. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room4 room2
10. toggle (unlock)
11. gotoroom room4 room2 yellow_door_1
12. gotodoor blue_door_1 room2 room1
13. (now in front of blue_door_1, constraint met)

Thus, the goal is achieved at step10, but the agent must also be in front of blue_door_1. So steps1-13:

Steps:

1. gotodoor blue_door_2 room1 room3
2. toggle blue_door_2
3. gotoroom room1 room3
4. gotodoor purple_door_1 room3 room4
5. toggle purple_door_1
6. gotoroom room3 room4
7. gotoobject green_ball_1 room4
8. pick green_ball_1 room4
9. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room4 room2
10. toggle yellow_door_1
11. gotoroom room4 room2 yellow_door_1
12. gotodoor blue_door_1 room2 room1
13. toggle blue_door_1

Now, the goal is achieved at step10, but the agent needs to be in front of blue_door_1 at step12. So the plan is valid. The steps are 13. But wait, the goal requires that the agent is in front of yellow_door_1 and it's unlocked. So in step10, the agent is in front of yellow_door_1 in room4, which is unlocked. So the goal is met. Then, the steps after that are to satisfy the constraint. So the total steps are 12: steps1-10 achieve the goal, but steps11-12 are needed for the constraint. But step12 is gotodoor blue_door_1 in room2, which requires the agent to be in room2. So after step10, agent is in room4, front of yellow_door_1. Toggling unlocks it. Then, they can go to room2 (step11). Then, in room2, goto blue_door_1 (step12). Now, they are in front of blue_door_1 in room2. The constraint is satisfied because step12 is in front of blue_door_1, and step8 (holding green_ball_1) is before it. Then, toggle blue_door_1 (step13) unlocks it, but that's optional. However, the goal is already achieved, so the plan can end at step12. But the problem requires the final state to meet the goal. So the agent can be in front of yellow_door_1 at step10, but then move to room2 and goto blue_door_1. But the final state must have the agent in front of yellow_door_1. So the plan must end with the agent in front of yellow_door_1 and it being unlocked. So the agent can't move away after step10. Therefore, the steps must include being in front of yellow_door_1 in the final state. So the initial plan that includes being in front of yellow_door_1 after unlocking it is better.

But in the alternative plan, after step10, the agent is in front of yellow_door_1 in room4, which is unlocked. Then, they go to room2 (step11), but that makes them leave the front of the door. So the final state is not meeting the goal. Therefore, the agent must remain in front of yellow_door_1 after unlocking it. So the correct plan would require that the agent stays in front of yellow_door_1 after unlocking it. Hence, the initial plan of 15 steps is necessary.

However, in the alternative plan where the agent unlocks yellow_door_1 in room4 and remains there, the final state is correct, but the agent must also go to blue_door_1 in room2, which requires leaving the final goal state. Therefore, this approach won't work.

Thus, the original plan seems to be the only valid one, with 15 steps. But perhaps there's a shorter way.

Wait, after step13 in the initial plan (agent in room2), the agent can go to yellow_door_1 and toggle it. So steps:

After step13 (agent in room2), they can go to yellow_door_1 in room2 (step14: gotodoor), then toggle it (step15), which unlocks it. Then, they are in front of it. So the steps are 15, and the goal is achieved.

But how does the agent get to room2? By unlocking blue_door_1. So the agent must go through room1 to room2 via blue_door_1. So the steps are necessary.

I think this is the optimal plan.
