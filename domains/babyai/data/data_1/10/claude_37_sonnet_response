Let's break down the problem:

1. We need to find a plan where the goal is to be in front of the blue door (that connects room_1 and room_2), and the door should be unlocked.
2. We have a constraint that we can't enter room_2 at any point in our plan.

First, let's identify the blue door:
- `blue_door_1` is blue and connects room_1 and room_2.

Now, starting from the initial state:
- I am in room_4.
- From room_4, I can access:
  - room_2 via yellow_door_1, but I'm not allowed to enter room_2 due to the constraint.
  - room_3 via yellow_door_2, which is locked.

So, I need to first unlock yellow_door_2 to move to room_3:
1. `gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_3`
2. `toggle yellow_door_2`
3. `gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_2`

Now, I'm in room_3. From room_3, I can access:
- room_1 via red_door_1, which is locked.
- room_4 via yellow_door_2, which I've already unlocked.

I need to unlock red_door_1 to move to room_1:
4. `gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1`
5. `toggle red_door_1`
6. `gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1`

Now, I'm in room_1. I can go to the blue door that connects room_1 and room_2, which is locked. I need to unlock it:
7. `gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2`
8. `toggle blue_door_1`

Now I'm in front of the blue door, which is unlocked. This should satisfy the goal.

Let's verify the plan:

Starting state:
- I am in room_4.
- All doors are locked.

1. `gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_3`: I go in front of yellow_door_2 in room_4. This is valid because yellow_door_2 connects room_4 and room_3, and I'm in room_4.
2. `toggle yellow_door_2`: I unlock yellow_door_2. This is valid because I'm in front of it.
3. `gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_2`: I move from room_4 to room_3 using yellow_door_2. This is valid because yellow_door_2 is unlocked.
4. `gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1`: I go in front of red_door_1 in room_3. This is valid because red_door_1 connects room_3 and room_1, and I'm in room_3.
5. `toggle red_door_1`: I unlock red_door_1. This is valid because I'm in front of it.
6. `gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1`: I move from room_3 to room_1 using red_door_1. This is valid because red_door_1 is unlocked.
7. `gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2`: I go in front of blue_door_1 in room_1. This is valid because blue_door_1 connects room_1 and room_2, and I'm in room_1.
8. `toggle blue_door_1`: I unlock blue_door_1. This is valid because I'm in front of it.

Final state:
- I am in room_1, in front of blue_door_1.
- blue_door_1 is unlocked.

This satisfies the goal: "There is a door d such that "The following conditions are all true: "d is blue", "room_1 and room_2 are connected via d", "you are in front of d", "d is not locked""

And it also abides by the constraint: "you are not in room_2" throughout the plan.

Let me double-check one more time:

1. `gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_3` - this brings me in front of yellow_door_2 in room_4.
2. `toggle yellow_door_2` - this unlocks yellow_door_2.
3. `gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_2` - this moves me from room_4 to room_3.
4. `gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1` - this brings me in front of red_door_1 in room_3.
5. `toggle red_door_1` - this unlocks red_door_1.
6. `gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1` - this moves me from room_3 to room_1.
7. `gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2` - this brings me in front of blue_door_1 in room_1.
8. `toggle blue_door_1` - this unlocks blue_door_1.

This seems like the optimal plan, as it's the shortest path to achieve the goal while satisfying the constraint.

Reviewing the plan once more, I'm satisfied that:
1. Starting from room_4, I can't directly go to room_1 (due to no direct connection) and I can't go through room_2 (due to the constraint).
2. So, I go through room_3, which is accessible from room_4 via yellow_door_2 (after unlocking it).
3. From room_3, I can reach room_1 via red_door_1 (after unlocking it).
4. Finally, once in room_1, I can go to blue_door_1 and unlock it, satisfying the goal.

The plan is valid and optimal. Here it is:

1. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_3
2. toggle yellow_door_2
3. gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_2
4. gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1
5. toggle red_door_1
6. gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1
7. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2
8. toggle blue_door_1
