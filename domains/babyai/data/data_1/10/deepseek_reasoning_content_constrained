Okay, let's try to figure out this planning problem. So, the goal is to be in front of a blue door that connects room_1 and room_2, which is unlocked. And also, I can't be in room_2 at any point. The initial state has me in room_4, and all doors are locked. Hmm, the blue door connecting room_1 and room_2 is blue_door_1. But that door is locked initially. So I need to unlock it. But to toggle a door, I have to be in front of it. But how do I get there without entering room_2?

Wait, the blue_door_1 connects room_1 and room_2. So to go to that door, I need to be in either room_1 or room_2. But the constraint says I can't be in room_2 at any state. So the only way is to be in room_1 and go to the blue_door_1 from there. But how do I get to room_1? Let's look at the initial state. I'm in room_4. The doors from room_4 are yellow_door_1 (connects to room_2, which I can't go to) and yellow_door_2 (connects to room_3). But all doors are locked. So first, I need to unlock some doors to move around.

Let's see the doors. The doors connecting room_4 are yellow_door_1 (room_4-room_2) and yellow_door_2 (room_4-room_3). Both are yellow and locked. So maybe I can unlock one of them. To toggle a door, I need to be in front of it. But to get in front of it, I need to be in a room connected by that door. So if I'm in room_4, I can go in front of yellow_door_1 (connects to room_2) or yellow_door_2 (connects to room_3). But if I go to yellow_door_1, that's in room_4, but if I try to go in front of it, I need to check if there's an object blocking it. Wait, the preconditions for "gotodoor" say that there's no object blocking the position in front of the door in the current room. The initial state: objects in room_4 are purple_ball_1 and grey_ball_2. Are they blocking the doors? The problem doesn't mention objects blocking doors unless they are in front. Since the initial positions aren't specified as blocking, maybe the doors are not blocked. So maybe I can go to yellow_door_2 from room_4, toggle it to unlock, then go to room_3.

Wait, let's outline the steps. Starting in room_4. To get to room_1, which is connected via red_door_1 to room_3. So the path could be room_4 → room_3 → room_1. But all doors are locked. So first, unlock yellow_door_2 (connecting room_4 and room_3). Then go to room_3. From room_3, the red_door_1 connects to room_1. But red_door_1 is locked. So need to unlock it. But how to get to red_door_1? To toggle it, need to be in front of it. So from room_3, go to red_door_1, which connects room_3 and room_1. But to go in front of red_door_1 from room_3, I need to check if there's an object blocking it. The objects in room_3 are blue_ball_1, grey_box_1, and purple_box_1. Unless one of them is in front of the door, which I don't know. But the problem states initial positions but not specific locations. The preconditions for "gotodoor" are that you are in a room connected by the door, and no object is blocking the position in front of the door in the current room. Assuming that the doors are not blocked by objects, then I can go to red_door_1 from room_3, toggle it to unlock, then go to room_1 via red_door_1.

Once in room_1, I can go to blue_door_1 (since it connects room_1 and room_2), toggle it to unlock. Then, the goal requires being in front of blue_door_1 (which is in room_1), with it unlocked. So the steps would be:

1. From room_4, go to yellow_door_2 (room4 to room3), unlock it.
2. Go to room3.
3. In room3, go to red_door_1, unlock it.
4. Go to room1.
5. In room1, go to blue_door_1, unlock it.
6. Now, in front of blue_door_1, which is unlocked.

But need to check constraints. The constraint is that in every state, I'm not in room_2. So all these steps avoid room_2. Let's see:

- Starting in room4.
- After step 1 (gotodoor yellow_door_2 room4 room3), then toggle it (unlock). Then, gotoroom room4 room3 yellow_door_2. Now in room3. Then, gotodoor red_door_1 room3 room1. Toggle to unlock. Then gotoroom room3 room1 red_door_1. Now in room1. Then gotodoor blue_door_1 room1 room2. Toggle to unlock. Then, now in front of blue_door_1 in room1, which is unlocked. So the final state meets the goal.

Wait, but the blue_door_1 is initially locked. So after toggling, it becomes unlocked. So yes. Let's write the steps:

But let's check the actions step by step:

Initial state: in room4, holding nothing.

First, need to unlock yellow_door_2 (connects room4 and room3). So:

1. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room4 room3. Preconditions: in a room connected by the door (room4 is connected via yellow_door_2 to room3), and no object blocking in current room. Assuming no blocking, so action allowed. Then, toggle yellow_door_2. Now it's unlocked.

Wait, but to toggle, you need to be in front of the door. So first, goto the door, then toggle.

So step by step:

1. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room4 room3 (since I'm in room4). This puts me in front of yellow_door_2.

2. toggle yellow_door_2. Now it's unlocked.

3. gotoroom room4 room3 yellow_door_2. Move to room3.

Now in room3. Next, unlock red_door_1 (connects room3 and room1). So:

4. gotodoor red_door_1 room3 room1. (I'm in room3, connected via red_door_1 to room1. Assuming no blocking.)

5. toggle red_door_1. Now it's unlocked.

6. gotoroom room3 room1 red_door_1. Now in room1.

Now, need to unlock blue_door_1 (connects room1 and room2). But since the constraint is never to be in room2, but blue_door_1 is in room1. So:

7. gotodoor blue_door_1 room1 room2. (In room1, so allowed.)

8. toggle blue_door_1. Now it's unlocked.

Now, after step 8, the blue_door_1 is unlocked, and I'm in front of it in room1. So the goal is achieved.

But wait, the goal is to have a door d that is blue, connects room1 and room2, you are in front of it, and it's not locked. So after step 8, all conditions are met. So the plan would be:

gotoempty (to be in front of empty, but maybe not necessary. Wait, initial state: in room4. So first action is gotodoor yellow_door_2 room4 room3.

Wait, the initial position: the agent is in room4. To go to a door in room4, which is yellow_door_1 or yellow_door_2. Since yellow_door_2 connects to room3, which is allowed. So the first action is:

Action: gotodoor yellow_door_2 room4 room3.

Then toggle it.

Then gotoroom room4 room3 yellow_door_2.

Then in room3, go to red_door_1 (gotodoor red_door_1 room3 room1).

Toggle red_door_1.

Gotoroom room3 room1 red_door_1.

Then in room1, go to blue_door_1 (gotodoor blue_door_1 room1 room2).

Toggle blue_door_1.

Now, blue_door_1 is unlocked, and the agent is in front of it in room1. That should meet the goal.

But let's check constraints. At no point is the agent in room2. All actions are moving to room3 and room1. So the constraints are satisfied.

Now, let's check if all preconditions are met:

1. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room4 room3: agent is in room4 (yes), door connects room4 and room3 (yes). No object blocking in room4? The objects in room4 are purple_ball_1 and grey_ball_2. The problem doesn't specify positions, so assuming they are not blocking the door. So allowed.

2. toggle yellow_door_2: agent is in front of it, so allowed. Toggles from locked to unlocked.

3. gotoroom room4 room3 yellow_door_2: door is now unlocked, so allowed. Moves to room3.

4. gotodoor red_door_1 room3 room1: in room3, door connects room3 and room1. No blocking objects. Allowed.

5. toggle red_door_1: in front of it. Toggles to unlocked.

6. gotoroom room3 room1 red_door_1: door unlocked. Moves to room1.

7. gotodoor blue_door_1 room1 room2: in room1, door connects to room2. No blocking. Allowed.

8. toggle blue_door_1: in front, toggles to unlocked.

Now, after step 8, the agent is in front of blue_door_1 in room1, which is blue, connects room1 and room2, and is unlocked. The goal is achieved. And the constraints are never violated as the agent never enters room2.

So the plan should be these 8 actions. Let me write them out:

```
goto_door yellow_door_2 room4 room3
toggle yellow_door_2
goto_room room4 room3 yellow_door_2
goto_door red_door_1 room3 room1
toggle red_door_1
goto_room room3 room1 red_door_1
goto_door blue_door_1 room1 room2
toggle blue_door_1
```

Wait, but the action names are "gotodoor d r1 r2" and "gotoroom r1 r2 d". So the first action is "gotodoor yellow_door_2 room4 room3". The second is toggle. Third is "gotoroom room4 room3 yellow_door_2". Then "gotodoor red_door_1 room3 room1", toggle, "gotoroom room3 room1 red_door_1", then "gotodoor blue_door_1 room1 room2", toggle.

Yes. So that's 8 steps. Let me check if there's a shorter path. For example, can I avoid going to room3 first? Let's see. The agent starts in room4. To get to room1, the path is room4 → room3 → room1. Because the other doors from room4 are to room2 (which is forbidden). So no other way. So this seems optimal.

Is there a way to do it in fewer steps? Let's see. Each step is necessary. Unlocking yellow_door_2, moving to room3, unlocking red_door_1, moving to room1, unlocking blue_door_1. Each action is necessary. So 8 steps. I think this is the optimal plan.
