Okay, let's try to figure out this planning problem step by step. The goal is to have a purple door that's unlocked, I'm in front of it, and it's not locked. The constraints are that at some point, purple_door_2 must be locked, and if it's ever locked, then grey_ball_1 must be in room_3 either at that state or later.

Starting from room_4. Let's see the initial state. The doors are all locked. The purple doors are purple_door_1 (connecting room_1 and room_3) and purple_door_2 (connecting room_2 and room_4). The goal is to be in front of a purple door that's unlocked. So possible candidates are purple_door_1 or purple_door_2. But since I'm in room_4, maybe purple_door_2 is accessible via room_2, but the door is locked initially. Grey_door_1 connects room_4 and room_3, but it's locked. So first, I need to unlock doors to move around.

But the constraints: At some state, purple_door_2 must be locked. Since initially it's locked, but the constraint says that it must hold in at least one state. Wait, but if the initial state already has purple_door_2 locked, then that satisfies the first constraint. But then the second constraint says that whenever purple_door_2 is locked in any state s, then grey_ball_1 must be in room_3 either at s or after. Since initially, purple_door_2 is locked, and in the initial state, grey_ball_1 is in room_1, which doesn't satisfy the condition. So the problem is that the initial state already violates the constraint? Wait, no. The constraint says that if in some state s, purple_door_2 is locked, then in s or any state after s, grey_ball_1 must be in room_3. But in the initial state, purple_door_2 is locked, but grey_ball_1 is in room_1, so that's a problem. Therefore, we need to make sure that either we unlock purple_door_2 before that state (so that it's not locked anymore) or ensure that after the state where it's locked, grey_ball_1 is moved to room_3.

Wait, but the initial state already has purple_door_2 locked. So according to the constraint, in the initial state s0, if purple_door_2 is locked, then grey_ball_1 must be in room_3 in s0 or any state after. But in the initial state, grey_ball_1 is in room_1. So that violates the constraint. Therefore, the initial state is invalid? But the problem says that the initial state is given, and we have to find a plan that satisfies the constraints. So perhaps the constraints are applied to the plan's execution. Wait, the constraints say that "the following expression must hold in at least one state: purple_door_2 is locked". So the initial state counts, so that's satisfied. Then the second constraint: if in any state s (including the initial state), purple_door_2 is locked, then in s or any state after, grey_ball_1 must be in room_3. So in the initial state s0, purple_door_2 is locked, so we need to ensure that in s0 or any state after, grey_ball_1 is in room_3. But in s0, it's in room_1. Therefore, we need to move it to room_3 at some point after s0. So the plan must include moving grey_ball_1 to room_3.

So the goal is to have a purple door (d) that's unlocked, in front of it, and d is not locked. The constraints are that at least once in the plan, purple_door_2 is locked (which it is initially, so that's covered), and that whenever purple_door_2 is locked (which is true in the initial state), then from that point onward, at some point (could be later) grey_ball_1 is in room_3. So we need to ensure that during the plan, after the initial state, we move grey_ball_1 to room_3.

So the steps would be:

1. Move from room_4 to room_3 via grey_door_1, but it's locked. So I need to unlock it. To toggle a door, I need to be in front of it. So first, go to grey_door_1 in room_4. But to go to a door, I need to be in a room connected by that door. Since I'm in room_4, grey_door_1 connects to room_3, so I can go to grey_door_1 from room_4. But the precondition for "gotodoor" is that there's no object blocking the position in front of the door in the current room. Are there any objects blocking doors? Let's check initial state: In room_4, there's red_ball_1 and purple_box_1. Are any of these blocking the doors? The problem says that if an object is in front of a door, then it blocks it. But the initial positions of objects are not specified in terms of doors. So maybe the initial positions are such that objects are not blocking doors. So perhaps I can go to grey_door_1 in room_4.

So steps:

- gotoempty (to not be in front of anything)
- gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3 (but wait, the syntax is gotodoor d r1 r2, where d is the door, and r1 and r2 are the connected rooms. So in room_4, grey_door_1 connects room_4 and room_3. So gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3. Then toggle it to unlock.

Wait, but the initial state says that all doors are locked. So I need to unlock grey_door_1 first to get to room_3.

So plan starts:

1. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3 (go to the door in room_4)
2. toggle grey_door_1 (unlock it)
3. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1 (move to room_3)

Once in room_3, I can pick up the blue_box_1 or blue_box_2. But why? Because maybe I need to use them to unlock other doors. Wait, but the goal is to be in front of a purple door that's unlocked. The purple doors are purple_door_1 (connects room_1 and room_3) and purple_door_2 (connects room_2 and room_4). So perhaps purple_door_1 is in room_3, so if I can get to room_1 via purple_door_1, but it's locked. Alternatively, maybe unlocking purple_door_2 would be easier.

Wait, let's think. The goal is to be in front of a purple door that's unlocked. Let's consider possible doors:

purple_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3. So in room_1 or room_3, I can access it. But initially, it's locked. purple_door_2 connects room_2 and room_4. So in room_2 or room_4, I can access it. Also locked initially.

So maybe the plan is to unlock purple_door_2, but that's in room_4. But I'm starting in room_4. Wait, but to go to purple_door_2 from room_4, I need to be in room_4. So from room_4, I can go to purple_door_2 (since it connects room_4 and room_2). So:

But I need to unlock it. So to toggle it, I need to be in front of it. So first, go to purple_door_2 in room_4. Are there any objects blocking the door? In room_4, there's red_ball_1 and purple_box_1. Are they blocking the door? If not, then I can go to the door. Let's assume they are not blocking. So steps:

But wait, after moving to room_3 via grey_door_1 (after unlocking it), maybe there's a path to room_1 via purple_door_1. But purple_door_1 is locked and purple. So perhaps the plan is to unlock purple_door_1, but to do that, I need to get in front of it.

Alternatively, maybe unlock purple_door_2 in room_4. But since purple_door_2 connects room_4 and room_2, to get to room_2, I need to go through purple_door_2. But it's locked. So first, go to purple_door_2 in room_4, toggle it (unlock), then go to room_2. Then from room_2, maybe go to room_1 via yellow_door_1 (which is locked initially). But yellow_door_1 is yellow, and there's a yellow_box_1 in room_1. Hmm.

But the constraints require that whenever purple_door_2 is locked (which it is initially and maybe after toggling it again), then grey_ball_1 must be in room_3. So since the initial state has purple_door_2 locked, and grey_ball_1 in room_1, we need to move grey_ball_1 to room_3 at some point.

So the steps would involve:

1. Unlock grey_door_1 to get into room_3.

But how to move grey_ball_1 from room_1 to room_3? To do that, the agent needs to go to room_1, pick up the grey_ball_1, carry it to room_3, and drop it. But the agent starts in room_4. Let's outline the path.

Possible path:

From room_4, unlock grey_door_1, go to room_3. Then from room_3, unlock purple_door_1 (since it's purple and locked), go to room_1. In room_1, pick up grey_ball_1, carry it back to room_3, drop it. Then go back to room_4 via grey_door_1, unlock purple_door_2 (which is in room_4), then go to purple_door_2, toggle it to unlock, then be in front of it. That would satisfy the goal.

But let's check the steps.

Wait, first, in room_4:

- gotoempty (to clear any front position)
- gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3 (if not blocked)
- toggle grey_door_1 (unlocks it)
- gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1 (now in room_3)

In room_3:

- Need to get to purple_door_1 (connects room_1 and room_3). So in room_3, purple_door_1 is present.

So:

- gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_1 (go to the door)
- toggle purple_door_1 (unlocks it)
- gotoroom room_3 room_1 purple_door_1 (enter room_1)

In room_1:

- grey_ball_1 is here. Need to pick it up.

So:

- gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_1
- pick grey_ball_1 room_1

Now carrying grey_ball_1. Need to take it to room_3.

Return to room_3:

- gotoempty (to leave front of door)
- gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_3
- gotoroom room_1 room_3 purple_door_1 (back to room_3)
- drop grey_ball_1 room_3 (need to be in front of an empty spot)

But to drop, need to be in front of an empty position. So before dropping:

- gotoempty (in room_3)
- drop grey_ball_1 room_3

Now, grey_ball_1 is in room_3, satisfying the constraint.

Now, need to get to a purple door (either purple_door_1 or purple_door_2) and have it unlocked. Let's consider purple_door_2 in room_4. So to reach it, the agent needs to go back to room_4 via grey_door_1.

From room_3:

- gotoempty
- gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4
- toggle grey_door_1 (it was unlocked, so toggling would lock it? Wait, but we don't need to lock it. But the action is "toggle", which changes the state. So if it's unlocked, toggle locks it, and vice versa. So if we unlocked it earlier, we can go back through it without toggling again. Wait, no. To go through a door, it must be unlocked. So when going back to room_4, the door is unlocked, so we can pass. So:

- gotoroom room_3 room_4 grey_door_1 (back to room_4)

Now in room_4. Need to go to purple_door_2 (connecting room_4 and room_2). But initially, it's locked. So we need to unlock it.

So:

- gotoempty (to clear front)
- gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_2
- toggle purple_door_2 (unlocks it)
- Now, we're in front of purple_door_2, which is purple and unlocked. So this satisfies the goal.

So the final action is to be in front of purple_door_2 after unlocking it. So the plan would be:

1. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3
2. toggle grey_door_1
3. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1
4. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_1
5. toggle purple_door_1
6. gotoroom room_3 room_1 purple_door_1
7. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_1
8. pick grey_ball_1 room_1
9. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_3
10. gotoroom room_1 room_3 purple_door_1
11. gotoempty room_3
12. drop grey_ball_1 room_3
13. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4
14. gotoroom room_3 room_4 grey_door_1
15. gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_2
16. toggle purple_door_2
17. (now in front of purple_door_2, which is unlocked)

Wait, but after step 16 (toggle purple_door_2), the door is unlocked, and the agent is in front of it. So step 16's effect is that the door is unlocked, and the agent is in front of it. So that would satisfy the goal.

But let's check constraints:

- The constraint that purple_door_2 is locked in at least one state. Initially, it's locked. So that's covered.

- The other constraint: if in any state s where purple_door_2 is locked, then grey_ball_1 is in room_3 in s or after. The initial state s0 has purple_door_2 locked and grey_ball_1 in room_1. But in our plan, we move grey_ball_1 to room_3 in step 12. So after step 12, whenever purple_door_2 is locked (which was initially, but after step 16, it's unlocked). But the initial state counts, so we need to have grey_ball_1 in room_3 at some point after the initial state, which we do. So the constraint is satisfied.

But wait, the initial state is s0. In s0, purple_door_2 is locked. The constraint says that in s0 or any state after, grey_ball_1 must be in room_3. Since s0 has grey_ball_1 in room_1, but later in the plan (step 12), it's moved to room_3, so the constraint is satisfied.

So the plan seems valid.

But let's check each action's preconditions.

Step 1: gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3. Preconditions: agent is in a room connected by the door (yes, room_4), and no object is blocking the door's front in the current room. Assuming no objects are blocking, which the problem statement doesn't mention, so it's allowed.

Step 2: toggle grey_door_1. Must be in front of it. After step 1, the agent is in front of grey_door_1.

Step 3: gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1. Precondition: door is unlocked (yes, after toggle), and agent is in room_4 (yes). So valid.

Step 4: gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_1. Agent is in room_3, which is connected via purple_door_1. Assuming no blocking objects.

Step 5: toggle purple_door_1. Now in front of it, so allowed.

Step 6: gotoroom room_3 room_1 purple_door_1. Door is now unlocked, so can enter room_1.

Step7: gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_1. Agent is in room_1, so allowed.

Step8: pick. Preconditions: in same room, not holding anything. Correct.

Step9: gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_3. In room_1, connected via purple_door_1.

Step10: gotoroom to room_3. Door is unlocked.

Step11: gotoempty in room_3 to get to empty spot.

Step12: drop. Since holding grey_ball_1, and in room_3, in front of empty spot.

Step13: gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4. In room_3, connected via grey_door_1. No blocking.

Step14: gotoroom room_4. Door is unlocked.

Step15: gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_2. In room_4, connected via purple_door_2. No blocking.

Step16: toggle purple_door_2. Unlocks it.

So after step16, the agent is in front of purple_door_2 (after gotodoor in step15), and toggling it unlocks it. So the goal is achieved: there exists a door d (purple_door_2) which is purple, the agent is in front of it, and it's unlocked.

Additionally, the constraints are satisfied: purple_door_2 was locked in the initial state, and grey_ball_1 was moved to room_3 in step12, which is after the initial state. So the constraints are met.

This seems like a valid plan. Let me check if there's a shorter way. For example, perhaps after unlocking grey_door_1 and going to room_3, instead of going to room_1 via purple_door_1, maybe there's another path. But since grey_ball_1 is in room_1, the agent must go there. So steps 4-10 are necessary. Then moving back to room_3 and then to room_4.

Alternatively, maybe after moving grey_ball_1 to room_3, the agent can go directly to unlock purple_door_2. But the agent is in room_3, to get to room_4, use grey_door_1 (already unlocked), then in room_4, go to purple_door_2, unlock it, and be in front. That's what the current plan does. So steps 13-16. So that's necessary.

Is there any way to shorten the steps? For example, after dropping grey_ball_1 in room_3 (step12), can the agent directly go to grey_door_1, then to room_4, then to purple_door_2. Yes, which is steps 13-16. So it's necessary.

I think this is the optimal plan. Let me count the steps. Steps 1-16: 16 actions. Is there a way to have fewer steps?

Wait, when moving from room_3 back to room_4 via grey_door_1, do we need to go to the door again? Because after step12, the agent is in front of an empty spot. So step13 is gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4. Then step14 is gotoroom.

Alternatively, maybe after step12, the agent can just gotodoor directly. Let's see.

After step12 (drop grey_ball_1 in room_3), the agent is in front of an empty spot (since drop requires being in front of empty position). Then to leave room_3, the agent can go to grey_door_1:

Step13: gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4 (since in room_3)

Then step14: gotoroom to room_4.

Yes, that's necessary.

So steps are necessary. I think this is the minimal plan. So the final answer should be this sequence.
