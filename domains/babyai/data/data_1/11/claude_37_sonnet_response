Let me analyze this problem step by step:

1. The goal is to be in front of a purple door that is unlocked.

2. There are two purple doors: purple_door_1 (connecting room_1 and room_3) and purple_door_2 (connecting room_2 and room_4).

3. Initially:
   - I am in room_4
   - All doors are locked
   - grey_ball_1 is in room_1
   - Various other objects are distributed across rooms

4. The constraints are:
   - purple_door_2 must be locked at some point in the plan
   - If purple_door_2 is locked at some state, then grey_ball_1 must be in room_3 at that state or sometime after

Let me think about a possible plan:

First, I need to get to one of the purple doors. From room_4, I can reach:
- purple_door_2 (connecting room_4 and room_2)
- grey_door_1 (connecting room_4 and room_3)

Since I need to ensure purple_door_2 is locked at some point, I should probably go to it first.

1. I go to purple_door_2 from room_4
2. I unlock purple_door_2 (toggle it)
3. I move to room_2
4. I now need to lock purple_door_2 again to satisfy the first constraint, but before that I need to ensure grey_ball_1 is in or will be in room_3

The challenge is that grey_ball_1 is in room_1, and I need to move it to room_3. To do this:
- I need to go from room_2 to room_1 via yellow_door_1
- Pick up grey_ball_1
- Go back to room_2
- Then to room_4
- Then to room_3 via grey_door_1
- Drop grey_ball_1 in room_3
- Then I can lock purple_door_2 again
- Finally, I go to one of the purple doors and unlock it

But this might not work because all doors are locked initially, and I need to unlock them one by one.

Let me reconsider:

1. I start in room_4
2. I go to grey_door_1 (connecting room_4 and room_3)
3. I unlock grey_door_1
4. I go to room_3 from room_4 via grey_door_1
5. I go to purple_door_1 (connecting room_3 and room_1)
6. I unlock purple_door_1
7. I go to room_1 from room_3 via purple_door_1
8. I pick up grey_ball_1
9. I go back to room_3 from room_1 via purple_door_1
10. I drop grey_ball_1 in room_3
11. I go back to room_4 from room_3 via grey_door_1
12. I go to purple_door_2 (connecting room_4 and room_2)
13. I unlock purple_door_2
14. I go to room_2 from room_4 via purple_door_2
15. I go back to room_4 from room_2 via purple_door_2
16. I lock purple_door_2 (at this point grey_ball_1 is in room_3)
17. I go to one of the purple doors (e.g., back to purple_door_2)
18. I unlock purple_door_2

However, I noticed a possible issue. I need to be in front of the door to unlock it, but I may also need to move objects that could be blocking the door. Let me double-check if this is an issue with the given state.

Actually, after reviewing the initial state, I don't see any explicit statements about objects blocking doors, so I'll assume the doors are not blocked.

Let me refine my plan:

Starting state: I am in room_4, all doors are locked.

1. `gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3`: Go to grey_door_1 from room_4
2. `toggle grey_door_1`: Unlock grey_door_1
3. `gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1`: Go to room_3 from room_4 via grey_door_1
4. `gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_1`: Go to purple_door_1 from room_3
5. `toggle purple_door_1`: Unlock purple_door_1
6. `gotoroom room_3 room_1 purple_door_1`: Go to room_1 from room_3 via purple_door_1
7. `gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_1`: Go to grey_ball_1 in room_1
8. `pick grey_ball_1 room_1`: Pick up grey_ball_1
9. `gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_3`: Go to purple_door_1 from room_1
10. `gotoroom room_1 room_3 purple_door_1`: Go to room_3 from room_1 via purple_door_1
11. `gotoempty`: Go to an empty position in room_3
12. `drop grey_ball_1 room_3`: Drop grey_ball_1 in room_3
13. `gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4`: Go to grey_door_1 from room_3
14. `gotoroom room_3 room_4 grey_door_1`: Go to room_4 from room_3 via grey_door_1
15. `gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_2`: Go to purple_door_2 from room_4
16. `toggle purple_door_2`: Unlock purple_door_2
17. `gotoroom room_4 room_2 purple_door_2`: Go to room_2 from room_4 via purple_door_2
18. `gotodoor purple_door_2 room_2 room_4`: Go to purple_door_2 from room_2
19. `gotoroom room_2 room_4 purple_door_2`: Go to room_4 from room_2 via purple_door_2
20. `gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_2`: Go to purple_door_2 from room_4
21. `toggle purple_door_2`: Lock purple_door_2 (satisfying the first constraint)
22. `toggle purple_door_2`: Unlock purple_door_2 (satisfying the goal)

Wait, let me re-read the goal. I need to be in front of a purple door that is unlocked. After step 22, I will be in front of purple_door_2 and it will be unlocked. So this should satisfy the goal.

Let me review the constraints again:
1. "purple_door_2 is locked" must hold in at least one state - This is satisfied after step 21.
2. If "purple_door_2 is locked" holds in some state, then "grey_ball_1 is in room_3" must hold at that state or some state after - After step 21, purple_door_2 is locked, and grey_ball_1 is in room_3 (we moved it there in steps 7-12). So this constraint is satisfied.

It seems my plan is valid. Let me double-check it:

Starting state: I am in room_4, all doors are locked.

Actually, I noticed I'm being inefficient. Since I have to move grey_ball_1 to room_3 before locking purple_door_2, I should go directly to room_1 from room_4, rather than via room_3. But I can't go directly - I need to go through room_3 because that's how the rooms are connected.

Let me revise the plan for efficiency:

1. `gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3`: Go to grey_door_1 from room_4
2. `toggle grey_door_1`: Unlock grey_door_1
3. `gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1`: Go to room_3 from room_4 via grey_door_1
4. `gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_1`: Go to purple_door_1 from room_3
5. `toggle purple_door_1`: Unlock purple_door_1
6. `gotoroom room_3 room_1 purple_door_1`: Go to room_1 from room_3 via purple_door_1
7. `gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_1`: Go to grey_ball_1 in room_1
8. `pick grey_ball_1 room_1`: Pick up grey_ball_1
9. `gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_3`: Go to purple_door_1 from room_1
10. `gotoroom room_1 room_3 purple_door_1`: Go to room_3 from room_1 via purple_door_1
11. `gotoempty`: Go to an empty position in room_3
12. `drop grey_ball_1 room_3`: Drop grey_ball_1 in room_3

At this point, grey_ball_1 is in room_3. Now I need to go to a purple door and make sure it's unlocked.

Actually, I could just go back to purple_door_1 since I'm already in room_3:

13. `gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_1`: Go to purple_door_1 from room_3

Wait, at this point, I'm in front of an unlocked purple door (purple_door_1). So I've already achieved the goal! 

Let me revisit the constraints:
1. "purple_door_2 is locked" must hold in at least one state - This is satisfied because purple_door_2 is locked in the initial state.
2. If "purple_door_2 is locked" holds in some state, then "grey_ball_1 is in room_3" must hold at that state or some state after - After step 12, grey_ball_1 is in room_3, and purple_door_2 is still locked (we never unlocked it). So this constraint is satisfied.

So my simplified plan is:

1. `gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3`: Go to grey_door_1 from room_4
2. `toggle grey_door_1`: Unlock grey_door_1
3. `gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1`: Go to room_3 from room_4 via grey_door_1
4. `gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_1`: Go to purple_door_1 from room_3
5. `toggle purple_door_1`: Unlock purple_door_1
6. `gotoroom room_3 room_1 purple_door_1`: Go to room_1 from room_3 via purple_door_1
7. `gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_1`: Go to grey_ball_1 in room_1
8. `pick grey_ball_1 room_1`: Pick up grey_ball_1
9. `gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_3`: Go to purple_door_1 from room_1
10. `gotoroom room_1 room_3 purple_door_1`: Go to room_3 from room_1 via purple_door_1
11. `gotoempty`: Go to an empty position in room_3
12. `drop grey_ball_1 room_3`: Drop grey_ball_1 in room_3
13. `gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_1`: Go to purple_door_1 from room_3

But now I realized another potential issue. The goal is "There is a door d such that 'The following conditions are all true: "d is purple", "you are in front of d", "d is not locked"'". Currently, purple_door_1 might still be locked after step 5 because I might have locked it again by toggling it. Let me clarify the actions:

- When I `toggle` a door, if it's locked, it becomes unlocked, and if it's unlocked, it becomes locked.
- Initially, purple_door_1 is locked.
- After step 5, it becomes unlocked.
- I don't toggle it again, so it remains unlocked.
- So after step 13, I'm in front of purple_door_1, and it's unlocked.

But now I'm confused about whether I've violated the constraints. Let me revisit them:

1. "purple_door_2 is locked" must hold in at least one state - This is satisfied because purple_door_2 is locked in the initial state.
2. If "purple_door_2 is locked" holds in some state, then "grey_ball_1 is in room_3" must hold at that state or some state after - After step 12, grey_ball_1 is in room_3, and purple_door_2 is still locked (we never unlocked it). So this constraint is satisfied.

Alright, I think I was overthinking. The constraints are satisfied, and my plan is valid. The optimal plan for this problem is:

1. `gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3`: Go to grey_door_1 from room_4
2. `toggle grey_door_1`: Unlock grey_door_1
3. `gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1`: Go to room_3 from room_4 via grey_door_1
4. `gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_1`: Go to purple_door_1 from room_3
5. `toggle purple_door_1`: Unlock purple_door_1
6. `gotoroom room_3 room_1 purple_door_1`: Go to room_1 from room_3 via purple_door_1
7. `gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_1`: Go to grey_ball_1 in room_1
8. `pick grey_ball_1 room_1`: Pick up grey_ball_1
9. `gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_3`: Go to purple_door_1 from room_1
10. `gotoroom room_1 room_3 purple_door_1`: Go to room_3 from room_1 via purple_door_1
11. `gotoempty`: Go to an empty position in room_3
12. `drop grey_ball_1 room_3`: Drop grey_ball_1 in room_3
13. `gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_1`: Go to purple_door_1 from room_3

Actually, wait, I see another optimization I can make. I don't need to go to an empty position before dropping the ball. I can drop it directly in front of me after stepping into room_3, which saves one action. So the optimal plan would be:

1. `gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3`: Go to grey_door_1 from room_4
2. `toggle grey_door_1`: Unlock grey_door_1
3. `gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1`: Go to room_3 from room_4 via grey_door_1
4. `gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_1`: Go to purple_door_1 from room_3
5. `toggle purple_door_1`: Unlock purple_door_1
6. `gotoroom room_3 room_1 purple_door_1`: Go to room_1 from room_3 via purple_door_1
7. `gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_1`: Go to grey_ball_1 in room_1
8. `pick grey_ball_1 room_1`: Pick up grey_ball_1
9. `gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_3`: Go to purple_door_1 from room_1
10. `gotoroom room_1 room_3 purple_door_1`: Go to room_3 from room_1 via purple_door_1
11. `drop grey_ball_1 room_3`: Drop grey_ball_1 in room_3
12. `gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_1`: Go to purple_door_1 from room_3

Wait, that doesn't work - after moving to room_3, I'm not in front of an empty position, so I can't drop the ball. I do need to go to an empty position first. So my previous plan was correct.

Actually, thinking more about this: after I `gotoroom room_1 room_3 purple_door_1` (step 10), the effects include "(iv) if you were in front of some object or door x0, then you are no longer in front of x0." So I would no longer be in front of purple_door_1. Therefore, I do need to go to an empty position before dropping the ball.

Let me review the preconditions and effects one more time to ensure my plan is correct.

For the action `drop`: "you may only drop an object x if (i) you are currently holding x, and (ii) the position in front of you is empty."

After step 10 (`gotoroom room_1 room_3 purple_door_1`), I am in room_3, holding grey_ball_1, and I've just moved through the door, so I'm not in front of anything specific. I need to ensure I'm in front of an empty position before dropping the ball.

For the action `gotoempty`: "you may go in front of an empty position anytime." Its effects include: "(i) if you were in front of some object or door x0, then you are no longer in front of x0 and (ii) you are in front of an empty position."

So after step 11 (`gotoempty`), I am in front of an empty position, allowing me to drop the ball in step 12.

I believe my original plan is correct. Here it is, formatted as required:

```
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3
toggle grey_door_1
gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_1
toggle purple_door_1
gotoroom room_3 room_1 purple_door_1
gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_1
pick grey_ball_1 room_1
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_3
gotoroom room_1 room_3 purple_door_1
gotoempty
drop grey_ball_1 room_3
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_1
```

Actually, I realize I might have made a mistake in the last step. After `drop grey_ball_1 room_3`, I am in front of grey_ball_1, not an empty position. So I need to move to purple_door_1 by using `gotodoor`.

1. `gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3`: Go to grey_door_1 from room_4
2. `toggle grey_door_1`: Unlock grey_door_1
3. `gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1`: Go to room_3 from room_4 via grey_door_1
4. `gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_1`: Go to purple_door_1 from room_3
5. `toggle purple_door_1`: Unlock purple_door_1
6. `gotoroom room_3 room_1 purple_door_1`: Go to room_1 from room_3 via purple_door_1
7. `gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_1`: Go to grey_ball_1 in room_1
8. `pick grey_ball_1 room_1`: Pick up grey_ball_1
9. `gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_3`: Go to purple_door_1 from room_1
10. `gotoroom room_1 room_3 purple_door_1`: Go to room_3 from room_1 via purple_door_1
11. `gotoempty`: Go to an empty position in room_3
12. `drop grey_ball_1 room_3`: Drop grey_ball_1 in room_3
13. `gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_1`: Go to purple_door_1 from room_3

With this final correction, I believe my plan is optimal (minimum number of actions) and valid. I've satisfied the goal of being in front of an unlocked purple door, and I've satisfied the constraints by ensuring that grey_ball_1 is in room_3 during or after a state where purple_door_2 is locked.

Here is the final plan:

```
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3
toggle grey_door_1
gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_1
toggle purple_door_1
gotoroom room_3 room_1 purple_door_1
gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_1
pick grey_ball_1 room_1
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_3
gotoroom room_1 room_3 purple_door_1
gotoempty
drop grey_ball_1 room_3
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_1
```
