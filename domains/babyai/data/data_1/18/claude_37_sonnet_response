Let's break down the problem:

1. Initial state:
   - I'm in room_4
   - There are various boxes and balls distributed across the rooms
   - All doors are locked
   - We've visited room_4

2. Goal:
   - Be in room_3, in front of green_ball_1 (which is already in room_3)

3. Constraint:
   - At some point, I need to be in room_1, in front of yellow_box_1 (which is already in room_1)

First, I need to come up with a plan to get to room_1, satisfy the constraint, then get to room_3 and stand in front of green_ball_1.

Currently, I'm in room_4. To get to room_1, I need to go through either room_2 or room_3. Let's think about the paths:

Path 1: room_4 -> room_2 -> room_1
Path 2: room_4 -> room_3 -> room_1

Both paths involve passing through two doors, so in terms of the number of door traversals, they're equivalent. Let's choose Path 1 for now (room_4 -> room_2 -> room_1).

But to go through a door, I need to unlock it first by performing the `toggle` action while standing in front of it.

So, the rough plan would be:
1. Go to the door connecting room_4 and room_2 (green_door_2)
2. Unlock green_door_2
3. Go to room_2
4. Go to the door connecting room_2 and room_1 (green_door_1)
5. Unlock green_door_1
6. Go to room_1
7. Go in front of yellow_box_1 (to satisfy the constraint)
8. Go back to room_2
9. Go to room_4
10. Go to the door connecting room_4 and room_3 (yellow_door_1)
11. Unlock yellow_door_1
12. Go to room_3
13. Go in front of green_ball_1

Actually, let's choose Path 2 (room_4 -> room_3 -> room_1) since it's more direct:
1. Go to the door connecting room_4 and room_3 (yellow_door_1)
2. Unlock yellow_door_1
3. Go to room_3
4. Go to the door connecting room_3 and room_1 (purple_door_1)
5. Unlock purple_door_1
6. Go to room_1
7. Go in front of yellow_box_1 (to satisfy the constraint)
8. Go back to room_3
9. Go in front of green_ball_1

This second plan seems more efficient as it involves fewer room transitions. Let's use this.

Now let's formalize the actions according to the provided action schema:

1. `gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_3`: Go in front of yellow_door_1 which connects room_4 and room_3.
2. `toggle yellow_door_1`: Unlock yellow_door_1.
3. `gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_1`: Go from room_4 to room_3 using yellow_door_1.
4. `gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_1`: Go in front of purple_door_1 which connects room_3 and room_1.
5. `toggle purple_door_1`: Unlock purple_door_1.
6. `gotoroom room_3 room_1 purple_door_1`: Go from room_3 to room_1 using purple_door_1.
7. `gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_1`: Go in front of yellow_box_1 in room_1.
8. `gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_3`: Go in front of purple_door_1 which connects room_1 and room_3.
9. `gotoroom room_1 room_3 purple_door_1`: Go from room_1 to room_3 using purple_door_1.
10. `gotoobject green_ball_1 room_3`: Go in front of green_ball_1 in room_3.

Wait, I need to double-check the "gotodoor" action. The precondition says "you may only go in front of a door d if (i) you are in a room which door d is connecting with another room, and (ii) there is no object blocking the position in front of d in the room you are currently in."

There's no mention of any objects blocking doors in the initial state, so I assume all doors are unblocked.

Let's finalize the plan:

1. `gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_3`: Go in front of yellow_door_1 which connects room_4 and room_3.
2. `toggle yellow_door_1`: Unlock yellow_door_1.
3. `gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_1`: Go from room_4 to room_3 using yellow_door_1.
4. `gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_1`: Go in front of purple_door_1 which connects room_3 and room_1.
5. `toggle purple_door_1`: Unlock purple_door_1.
6. `gotoroom room_3 room_1 purple_door_1`: Go from room_3 to room_1 using purple_door_1.
7. `gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_1`: Go in front of yellow_box_1 in room_1. (This satisfies the constraint)
8. `gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_3`: Go in front of purple_door_1 which connects room_1 and room_3.
9. `gotoroom room_1 room_3 purple_door_1`: Go from room_1 to room_3 using purple_door_1.
10. `gotoobject green_ball_1 room_3`: Go in front of green_ball_1 in room_3. (This achieves the goal)

This plan seems to meet the goal and the constraint. Let's check if there's a more efficient way to do it.

Actually, the plan above is already minimal for the given objectives. It efficiently navigates from room_4 to room_1 to satisfy the constraint, and then to room_3 to achieve the goal.

Let me double check each of the actions to ensure they meet the preconditions:

1. `gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_3`: We are in room_4 and yellow_door_1 connects room_4 to room_3. No object is mentioned as blocking the door. Precondition met.

2. `toggle yellow_door_1`: We're in front of yellow_door_1 after the previous action. Precondition met.

3. `gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_1`: We're in room_4, which is adjacent to room_3 via yellow_door_1. Yellow_door_1 is now unlocked. Precondition met.

4. `gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_1`: After going to room_3, purple_door_1 connects room_3 to room_1. No object is mentioned as blocking the door. Precondition met.

5. `toggle purple_door_1`: We're in front of purple_door_1 after the previous action. Precondition met.

6. `gotoroom room_3 room_1 purple_door_1`: We're in room_3, which is adjacent to room_1 via purple_door_1. Purple_door_1 is now unlocked. Precondition met.

7. `gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_1`: After going to room_1, yellow_box_1 is in the same room. Precondition met.

8. `gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_3`: After going in front of yellow_box_1 in room_1, purple_door_1 connects room_1 to room_3. No object is mentioned as blocking the door. Precondition met.

9. `gotoroom room_1 room_3 purple_door_1`: We're in room_1, which is adjacent to room_3 via purple_door_1. Purple_door_1 is unlocked. Precondition met.

10. `gotoobject green_ball_1 room_3`: After going to room_3, green_ball_1 is in the same room. Precondition met.

All preconditions for the actions in our plan are met. Therefore, our final plan is:

1. `gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_3`
2. `toggle yellow_door_1`
3. `gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_1`
4. `gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_1`
5. `toggle purple_door_1`
6. `gotoroom room_3 room_1 purple_door_1`
7. `gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_1`
8. `gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_3`
9. `gotoroom room_1 room_3 purple_door_1`
10. `gotoobject green_ball_1 room_3`
