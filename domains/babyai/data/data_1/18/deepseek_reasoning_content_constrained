Okay, let's tackle this planning problem step by step. The goal is to get a green ball into room_3, be in room_3, and be in front of that ball. Also, there's a constraint that at some point, I must be in room_1 in front of yellow_box_1. Let's start by understanding the initial state and the available actions.

First, the initial state: I'm in room_4. The green_ball_1 is in room_3, which is good because the goal requires a green ball in room_3. So maybe I don't need to move the ball, but just position myself in front of it. Wait, the goal says "there is a ball v such that v is green, in room_3, I'm in room_3, and in front of v." The green_ball_1 is already in room_3, so if I can get to room_3 and be in front of it, that's the goal. But how do I get to room_3?

Looking at the doors: room_4 is connected to room_3 via yellow_door_1, but it's locked. So I need to unlock it. But to toggle a door, I need to be in front of it. So I have to go to yellow_door_1 from room_4, which requires going in front of it. But first, I need to check if any objects are blocking the door in room_4. The initial objects in room_4 are blue_box_1 and red_ball_1. If either is in front of the yellow_door_1, then I can't go to the door. But the problem doesn't specify where objects are positioned relative to doors, only which room they're in. Wait, the problem says "the position in front of d in the room you are currently in" must not be blocked. So, the preconditions for "gotodoor d r1 r2" require that there's no object blocking the position in front of d in the current room. But the initial state doesn't mention any objects blocking doors. So maybe I can assume that doors are not blocked unless stated otherwise. Wait, the problem's initial state doesn't mention any objects blocking doors, so I can proceed under the assumption that doors aren't blocked.

Wait, but the effect of "drop x r" says that if x was blocking a door, then it's no longer blocking. So maybe objects can block doors. But in the initial state, are any objects blocking doors? Since the initial state doesn't state that, perhaps they aren't. Therefore, I can assume that the doors are not blocked, so I can go to them.

So, to get from room_4 to room_3 via yellow_door_1, I need to:

1. Go to the yellow_door_1 in room_4 (since I'm in room_4). Action: gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_3. But wait, the gotodoor action's syntax is "gotodoor d r1 r2", so I need to specify the door and the two rooms it connects. So for yellow_door_1, which connects room_4 and room_3, the correct action would be "gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_3". But I need to check if I'm in a room connected by that door. Since I'm in room_4, and yellow_door_1 connects room_4 and room_3, that's okay. Then, once in front of the door, I can toggle it to unlock. Then, use gotoroom to go from room_4 to room_3 via yellow_door_1.

But wait, the door is initially locked. So steps:

- goto yellow_door_1 in room_4 (gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_3)
- toggle yellow_door_1 (unlocks it)
- gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_1 (moves to room_3)
- Then, in room_3, go to green_ball_1 (gotoobject green_ball_1 room_3)
- Then, be in front of it. That would satisfy the goal.

But wait, the goal requires that I'm in room_3 and in front of a green ball there. So if I do that, that's the goal. However, the constraints require that at some point, I must be in room_1 in front of yellow_box_1. So I need to include that in the plan.

So the problem is: how to get to room_1 in front of yellow_box_1, while also getting to room_3 in front of green_ball_1.

But the initial position is room_4. Let's see the connections:

From room_4, doors lead to room_2 (green_door_2) and room_3 (yellow_door_1). Both doors are locked initially. So to get to room_1, which is connected via green_door_1 to room_2 and via purple_door_1 to room_3. So room_1 is connected to room_2 (green_door_1) and room_3 (purple_door_1). But room_4 is connected to room_2 (green_door_2) and room_3 (yellow_door_1). So to get to room_1, the path would be room_4 → room_3 → room_1 via purple_door_1, or room_4 → room_2 → room_1 via green_door_1. Both paths involve multiple doors, which are locked.

Let's think about the required steps:

1. Need to unlock doors to move from room_4 to other rooms. Let's start with unlocking yellow_door_1 in room_4. But to unlock it, I have to be in front of it, toggle it. Then, go to room_3. But once in room_3, I can unlock purple_door_1 (connecting room_3 to room_1). However, purple_door_1 is locked initially. So to get to room_1 from room_3, I need to unlock purple_door_1. So steps:

- From room_4, go to yellow_door_1 (gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_3)
- toggle yellow_door_1 (unlock)
- gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_1 → now in room_3
- Then, in room_3, go to purple_door_1 (gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_1)
- toggle purple_door_1 (unlock)
- gotoroom room_3 room_1 purple_door_1 → now in room_1
- In room_1, go to yellow_box_1 (gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_1) → satisfies the constraint
- Then, return to room_3 via purple_door_1 (since it's now unlocked)
- Then, go to green_ball_1 in room_3

But wait, after going to room_1 and being in front of yellow_box_1, the constraint is met. Then, I need to get back to room_3 and then be in front of green_ball_1. Let's outline the steps:

1. Start in room_4.
2. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_3
3. toggle yellow_door_1 (unlock)
4. gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_1 → now in room_3
5. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_1
6. toggle purple_door_1 (unlock)
7. gotoroom room_3 room_1 purple_door_1 → now in room_1
8. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_1 → meets the constraint
9. Now, need to get back to room_3. So from room_1, use purple_door_1 again:
10. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_3
11. Since door is unlocked, gotoroom room_1 room_3 purple_door_1 → back to room_3
12. Then, gotoobject green_ball_1 room_3 → now in front of it, and in room_3. That meets the goal.

But wait, the goal requires that you are in room_3 and in front of a green ball. So step 12 would achieve that. The constraint is met in step 8. So this seems like a valid plan.

But let's check if all preconditions are met:

Step 2: gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_3. Precondition: I'm in a room connected by the door (yes, room_4), and no object is blocking the position in front of the door in room_4. Since initial objects in room_4 are blue_box_1 and red_ball_1. Unless they are blocking the door, but the problem doesn't state that. So assuming it's allowed.

Step 3: toggle requires being in front of the door. After step 2, I'm in front of yellow_door_1.

Step 4: gotoroom room_4 to room_3 via yellow_door_1. Door is now unlocked, so allowed.

Step 5: gotodoor purple_door_1 in room_3. Precondition: in room_3 (yes) and door connects to another room (room_1). No object blocking. Assuming allowed.

Step 6: toggle purple_door_1, now unlocked.

Step 7: gotoroom to room_1 via purple_door_1.

Step 8: gotoobject yellow_box_1 in room_1. Precondition: in room_1 (yes), and not holding anything (correct). Now in front of yellow_box_1, which meets the constraint.

Then steps 10-12 to return to room_3 and get in front of green_ball_1.

This seems to work. But wait, the initial state says the agent has visited room_4, but no other rooms. So after moving to room_3, that's a new room. Then to room_1, that's another new room. But the goal just requires being in room_3, which is achieved.

But what about the green_ball_1? It's already in room_3, so we don't need to move it. So the plan is to navigate to room_1 to meet the constraint, then back to room_3, and then go to the green_ball_1.

But let's count the steps. The steps are:

1. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_3
2. toggle yellow_door_1
3. gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_1
4. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_1
5. toggle purple_door_1
6. gotoroom room_3 room_1 purple_door_1
7. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_1
8. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_3
9. gotoroom room_1 room_3 purple_door_1
10. gotoobject green_ball_1 room_3

That's 10 steps. Is there a shorter way? Let's see.

Alternative path: Maybe go through room_2 instead. Let's see.

From room_4, green_door_2 connects to room_2. But green_door_2 is locked. So steps:

1. gotodoor green_door_2 room_4 room_2
2. toggle green_door_2 (unlock)
3. gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_2 → now in room_2
4. Then, room_2 is connected to room_1 via green_door_1 (locked). So need to unlock green_door_1.
5. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_1
6. toggle green_door_1 (unlock)
7. gotoroom room_2 room_1 green_door_1 → now in room_1
8. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_1 → constraint met
9. Then, return to room_2, then to room_4, then to room_3 via yellow_door_1?

But this path might be longer. Let's count steps for this approach:

Steps:

1. gotodoor green_door_2 room_4 room_2
2. toggle green_door_2
3. gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_2
4. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_1
5. toggle green_door_1
6. gotoroom room_2 room_1 green_door_1
7. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_1
8. gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_2
9. gotoroom room_1 room_2 green_door_1
10. gotodoor green_door_2 room_2 room_4
11. toggle green_door_2 (but it's already unlocked)
12. gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_2
13. Then go to yellow_door_1 in room_4, unlock, go to room_3, etc.

This would take more steps than the first approach. So the first approach through room_3 and purple_door_1 seems better.

Wait, but in the first approach, after going to room_1, we have to return to room_3. Let's confirm:

Original plan steps (simplified):

1. Unlock yellow_door_1 (room_4 → room_3)
2. Move to room_3
3. Unlock purple_door_1 (room_3 → room_1)
4. Move to room_1, meet constraint
5. Return to room_3
6. Go to green_ball_1.

That's 6 actions (excluding gotodoor and toggle steps). Wait, no, let me recount:

Original plan steps:

1. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_3 (step1)
2. toggle yellow_door_1 (step2)
3. gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_1 (step3)
4. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_1 (step4)
5. toggle purple_door_1 (step5)
6. gotoroom room_3 room_1 purple_door_1 (step6)
7. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_1 (step7)
8. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_3 (step8)
9. gotoroom room_1 room_3 purple_door_1 (step9)
10. gotoobject green_ball_1 room_3 (step10)

That's 10 actions. Is there a way to reduce this?

Wait, after step7 (being in front of yellow_box_1), maybe instead of going back through the door, can we go to another door? But room_1 is connected to room_2 via green_door_1 (locked) and to room_3 via purple_door_1 (unlocked). So the only way back is through purple_door_1.

Alternatively, if after meeting the constraint, can we proceed to the goal without going back to room_3? But the goal requires being in room_3. So no.

Alternatively, can we toggle the door after unlocking it again? Wait, once unlocked, it stays unlocked unless toggled again. So steps 8 and 9: gotodoor and gotoroom back to room_3. So that's necessary.

Alternatively, after step7, could we just do gotoroom directly? But to use gotoroom, you need to be in front of the door. So step8 is gotodoor to get in front of the door.

So steps 8 and 9 are needed.

Hmm. So 10 steps. Is there a way to combine steps or find a shorter path?

Another approach: Maybe the constraint requires being in room_1 in front of yellow_box_1 at least once. So could we do that after achieving the goal? But the goal is the final state. The constraint requires that at least once in any state (including intermediate) that condition holds. So perhaps we can go to room_1 after achieving the goal. But the goal requires being in room_3, so we need to get back. Wait, but the final goal is to be in room_3 in front of the green ball. So after achieving that, we can't move. So the constraint must be met during the plan, not necessarily after the goal is achieved.

Wait, the constraint is that "in at least one state" the condition holds. So it can be before achieving the goal. So maybe the optimal plan is to first go to room_1, meet the constraint, then proceed to room_3.

But how to get to room_1 from room_4, considering all locked doors.

Wait, maybe the fastest way is:

From room_4, unlock green_door_2 (connects to room_2), go to room_2, unlock green_door_1 (connects to room_1), go to room_1, meet constraint, then go back to room_2, then to room_4, then to room_3 via yellow_door_1, unlock it, and go to room_3.

But that seems longer. Let's count steps for this path:

1. gotodoor green_door_2 room_4 room_2 (step1)
2. toggle green_door_2 (unlock) (step2)
3. gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_2 (step3)
4. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_1 (step4)
5. toggle green_door_1 (unlock) (step5)
6. gotoroom room_2 room_1 green_door_1 (step6)
7. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_1 (step7) → constraint met
8. gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_2 (step8)
9. gotoroom room_1 room_2 green_door_1 (step9)
10. gotodoor green_door_2 room_2 room_4 (step10)
11. gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_2 (step11)
12. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_3 (step12)
13. toggle yellow_door_1 (step13)
14. gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_1 (step14)
15. gotoobject green_ball_1 room_3 (step15)

That's 15 steps, which is longer than the previous 10-step plan. So the first approach is better.

Another alternative: After unlocking purple_door_1 and getting to room_1, can we go to room_3 directly and then to room_3's green_ball_1. Which is the first plan's approach.

So the first plan's 10 steps seem better. But is there a way to make it even shorter?

Wait, after step6 (in room_1), step7 is gotoobject yellow_box_1. Then step8 is gotodoor purple_door_1 in room_1 (since purple_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3). So in room_1, the door is purple_door_1. So step8 is gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_3. Then step9: gotoroom room_1 to room_3 via purple_door_1. Then step10: gotoobject green_ball_1 room_3.

So that's 10 steps. Is there a way to eliminate any steps?

For example, after step3 (arrive in room_3), can we first go to room_1 to meet the constraint and then come back? But in room_3, purple_door_1 is locked. So steps4-6 are needed to unlock it.

Alternatively, maybe combining some actions? But each action is a separate step. So probably not.

Another idea: What if after step7 (being in front of yellow_box_1), instead of going back to room_3, could we do something else? But the goal requires being in room_3 in front of the green_ball_1, so we have to get back.

Alternatively, is there a way to pick up the green_ball_1 and bring it to room_3? But it's already in room_3. No need.

Wait, the green_ball_1 is already in room_3. So the only thing needed is to be in room_3 in front of it. So after getting to room_3, just gotoobject green_ball_1. So the steps are as before.

So the 10-step plan seems necessary. But wait, maybe there's a way to meet the constraint earlier.

Wait, what if after step3 (arrived in room_3), before unlocking purple_door_1, can we do something else? No, because we need to unlock purple_door_1 to get to room_1.

Alternatively, can we meet the constraint by first going to room_1 via another path? Probably not, given the locked doors.

So the 10-step plan is the minimal one.

But wait, let's check again the steps. Maybe some steps can be merged or optimized.

Wait, when you use gotoroom, you leave the previous room and enter the new one, and are no longer in front of any object. So after moving to room_3 (step3), you are in room_3, not in front of anything. Then, step4 is gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_1, which requires being in room_3 (yes). Then step5: toggle to unlock. Then step6: gotoroom to room_1.

Yes, that's correct.

So I think the plan I outlined earlier is the optimal one with 10 steps. Let me write it out properly with the correct action syntax.

The actions would be:

1. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_3
2. toggle yellow_door_1
3. gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_1
4. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_1
5. toggle purple_door_1
6. gotoroom room_3 room_1 purple_door_1
7. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_1
8. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_3
9. gotoroom room_1 room_3 purple_door_1
10. gotoobject green_ball_1 room_3

Each of these steps meets the preconditions. Let's verify each:

Step1: In room_4, which is connected to room_3 via yellow_door_1. Assuming no object is blocking the door in room_4. Correct.

Step2: In front of yellow_door_1, so can toggle. It's locked, now unlocked.

Step3: Door is unlocked, so can move to room_3.

Step4: In room_3, which is connected to room_1 via purple_door_1. No object blocking door in room_3. Correct.

Step5: In front of purple_door_1, toggle to unlock.

Step6: Door is unlocked, move to room_1.

Step7: In room_1, go to yellow_box_1. Correct.

Step8: In room_1, go to purple_door_1 (room_1 to room_3). Correct.

Step9: Door is unlocked, move back to room_3.

Step10: In room_3, go to green_ball_1. Correct.

This plan meets all constraints and the goal. The constraint is met in step7. The goal is met in step10.

Now, check if there's a shorter plan. Suppose we can avoid some steps. For example, after step6 (arrive in room_1), step7 is gotoobject. Then step8 gotodoor (to get in front of purple_door_1 again), step9 gotoroom back. But can we somehow combine steps? For example, after step6, when in room_1, can we toggle the door again? Not necessary, since it's already unlocked. So steps are necessary.

Is there any way to avoid going back to room_3? No, because the goal requires being there.

Thus, this is the optimal plan with 10 steps. I don't think a shorter plan is possible given the locked doors and the constraint.
