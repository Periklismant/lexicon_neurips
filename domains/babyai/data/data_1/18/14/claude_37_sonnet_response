Let me understand the problem here. I have:

1. 4 rooms arranged in a square formation.
2. 4 doors connecting these rooms (between room_1 and room_2, room_1 and room_3, room_2 and room_4, and room_3 and room_4).
3. The rooms contain boxes and balls, each with a color.
4. I need to find a plan to achieve a specific goal.

The goal is to have a blue ball in room_2, me (the agent) in room_2, and I should be in front of that blue ball.

I also have a constraint that there must be at least one state in the plan where I am in room_1.

Let me check the initial state:
- I'm in room_4.
- There's blue_ball_1 in room_2.
- There's blue_ball_2 in room_4.
- All 4 doors are locked.

Now, looking at the goal, I need to be in room_2 in front of a blue ball. The blue ball in room_2 is already blue_ball_1, so I don't need to move any ball. I just need to get to room_2 and go in front of blue_ball_1.

Let's think about how to achieve this:

1. I'm currently in room_4. I need to go to room_2.
2. I can go from room_4 to room_2 via green_door_1, but the door is locked. I need to unlock it.
3. To unlock the door, I need to be in front of it and then toggle it.
4. Once in room_2, I need to go in front of blue_ball_1.

However, I also have the constraint that I must be in room_1 at some point. So, I need to plan a route that includes room_1.

Here's a potential plan:
1. From room_4, I go to room_3 (via yellow_door_1, but it's locked, so I need to unlock it first).
2. From room_3, I go to room_1 (via grey_door_1, but it's locked, so I need to unlock it first).
3. From room_1, I go to room_2 (via purple_door_1, but it's locked, so I need to unlock it first).
4. In room_2, I go in front of blue_ball_1.

But this might not be the most efficient route (by the number of actions). Let me check an alternative:
1. From room_4, I go directly to room_2 (via green_door_1, but it's locked, so I need to unlock it first).
2. From room_2, I go to room_1 (via purple_door_1, but it's locked, so I need to unlock it first).
3. Return to room_2.
4. In room_2, I go in front of blue_ball_1.

This second approach seems more efficient. I need to perform fewer "gotoroom" actions. But, I also need to account for the "gotodoor" actions and "toggle" actions.

Let's build out the detailed plan for the second approach:

1. From room_4:
   - I need to go in front of green_door_1, toggle it, and then go to room_2.

2. From room_2:
   - I need to go in front of purple_door_1, toggle it, and then go to room_1.

3. From room_1:
   - I need to go back to room_2 via purple_door_1 (it's already unlocked at this point).

4. In room_2:
   - I need to go in front of blue_ball_1.

Now, let's translate this into the action format:

```
gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2
toggle green_door_1
gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_1
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1
toggle purple_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1
gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_2
```

This should satisfy the goal and the constraint.

Wait, actually, let me double-check the format of the actions based on the provided descriptions.

For `gotodoor`, the format is:
"gotodoor d r1 r2": Go in front of door d, connecting room r1 to room r2.

And the precondition is that you are in a room which door d is connecting with another room, and there is no object blocking the position in front of d in the room you are currently in.

So, for the first action, since I'm in room_4, I should be able to go in front of green_door_1 which connects room_4 and room_2. The action should be:
`gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2`

For `toggle`, the format is:
"toggle d": Unlock door d if is locked. Lock door d if is unlocked.

And the precondition is that you are in front of d.

So, after going in front of green_door_1, I should be able to toggle it:
`toggle green_door_1`

For `gotoroom`, the format is:
"gotoroom r1 r2 d": Go to room r2 from room r1 using door d.

And the precondition is that you are currently in a room r1 that is adjacent to r2, and the door connecting them is unlocked.

So, after toggling green_door_1, I should be able to go from room_4 to room_2:
`gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_1`

And so on for the rest of the actions.

Let's double-check all actions:

```
gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2
toggle green_door_1
gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_1
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1
toggle purple_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1
gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_2
```

Checking against the preconditions:

1. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2`: I'm in room_4, and green_door_1 connects room_4 and room_2, so I can go in front of it.
2. `toggle green_door_1`: After the previous action, I'm in front of green_door_1, so I can toggle it.
3. `gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_1`: I'm in room_4, room_2 is adjacent to room_4, and green_door_1 is now unlocked, so I can go from room_4 to room_2.
4. `gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1`: I'm in room_2, and purple_door_1 connects room_2 and room_1, so I can go in front of it.
5. `toggle purple_door_1`: After the previous action, I'm in front of purple_door_1, so I can toggle it.
6. `gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1`: I'm in room_2, room_1 is adjacent to room_2, and purple_door_1 is now unlocked, so I can go from room_2 to room_1.
7. `gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1`: I'm in room_1, room_2 is adjacent to room_1, and purple_door_1 is unlocked, so I can go from room_1 to room_2.
8. `gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_2`: I'm in room_2, and blue_ball_1 is in room_2, so I can go in front of it.

All actions in the plan satisfy their preconditions.

Let's check if the plan achieves the goal. After all the actions, I would be in room_2, in front of blue_ball_1, which is a blue ball in room_2. This matches the goal.

Let's also check if the constraint is satisfied. The constraint is that I must be in room_1 at some point. In our plan, after action 6, I am in room_1. So the constraint is satisfied.

I believe this plan is the most optimal (shortest) that achieves the goal and satisfies the constraint.

But let me re-check by considering the alternate path I mentioned earlier:

1. From room_4 to room_3 (via yellow_door_1)
2. From room_3 to room_1 (via grey_door_1)
3. From room_1 to room_2 (via purple_door_1)
4. In room_2, go in front of blue_ball_1

This would result in the following actions:

```
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_3
toggle yellow_door_1
gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_1
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1
toggle grey_door_1
gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2
toggle purple_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1
gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_2
```

This plan would have 10 actions, whereas the plan I provided earlier had 8 actions. So, the shorter plan is indeed the one that goes directly from room_4 to room_2, then to room_1, and back to room_2.

Thus, my final optimal plan is:

```
gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2
toggle green_door_1
gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_1
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1
toggle purple_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1
gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_2
```

Actually, I realize there might be an issue with the plan. Let me be very precise with the goal. The goal is:
"There is a ball v such that "The following conditions are all true: "v is blue", "v is in room_2", "you are in room_2", "you are in front of v"""

So, I need to be in room_2, and there needs to be a blue ball in room_2, and I need to be in front of that blue ball.

The current plan ends with me in room_2 in front of blue_ball_1, which is indeed a blue ball. Let me confirm the locations of the blue balls from the initial state:

- blue_ball_1 is in room_2
- blue_ball_2 is in room_4

So blue_ball_1 is already in room_2, and I don't need to move any balls. I just need to go to room_2 and stand in front of blue_ball_1. This is what the plan achieves, so the goal is satisfied.

Let me double-check our constraint again as well:
"The following expression must hold in at least one state: "you are in room_1""

Our plan does include a state where I am in room_1 (after action 6), so the constraint is satisfied.

Let's check if there's an even more optimal plan. The current plan has 8 actions. Is there a way to make it shorter?

Given the goal and the constraint, I need to:
1. Be in room_2 in front of a blue ball.
2. Visit room_1 at some point.

To reach room_2 from room_4, I need at least 3 actions: go in front of the door, toggle the door, and go through the door.
To satisfy the constraint of visiting room_1, I need to go from room_2 to room_1, which also requires at least 3 actions.
Finally, to return to room_2 from room_1, I need at least 1 action.
And to go in front of the blue ball in room_2, I need 1 more action.

So, at a minimum, I need 8 actions.

The plan I provided achieves the goal and the constraint with 8 actions, which appears to be the optimal (shortest) solution.

Let's finalize the optimal 8-action plan:

```
gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2
toggle green_door_1
gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_1
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1
toggle purple_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1
gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_2
```

Just to be doubly sure, let me check if there's another blue ball in room_2 that I could potentially be in front of to satisfy the goal. From the initial state, the only blue ball in room_2 is blue_ball_1. So, the goal does indeed refer to blue_ball_1.

Also, let me check if there's another way to reach room_1 by following a different path, which might lead to a shorter plan. From room_4, I can either go to room_2 or room_3. If I go to room_2, I'd then need to go to room_1. If I go to room_3, I'd also need to go to room_1. Either way, I'd end up in room_1. But after that, to return to room_2, I'd need to go directly from room_1 to room_2. Given the connectivity of the rooms, there's no shorter path.

So, I'm confident that the 8-action plan provided is indeed optimal.

Alright, here's the final optimal plan:

```
gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2
toggle green_door_1
gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_1
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1
toggle purple_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1
gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_2
```

I'm tracing through the plan once more step by step:

1. I start in room_4.
2. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2`: I go in front of green_door_1 in room_4. This door connects room_4 and room_2.
3. `toggle green_door_1`: I toggle green_door_1, which unlocks it (since all doors are initially locked).
4. `gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_1`: I go from room_4 to room_2 through green_door_1.
5. `gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1`: I go in front of purple_door_1 in room_2. This door connects room_2 and room_1.
6. `toggle purple_door_1`: I toggle purple_door_1, which unlocks it.
7. `gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1`: I go from room_2 to room_1 through purple_door_1. This satisfies the constraint that I must be in room_1 at some point.
8. `gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1`: I go back from room_1 to room_2 through purple_door_1.
9. `gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_2`: I go in front of blue_ball_1 in room_2. blue_ball_1 is a blue ball already in room_2, so I'm now in room_2 in front of a blue ball, which satisfies the goal.

This plan achieves the goal and satisfies the constraint with 8 actions. I believe it is the optimal (shortest) solution.

```
gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2
toggle green_door_1
gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_1
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1
toggle purple_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1
gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_2
```
