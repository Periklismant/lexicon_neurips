Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. So the goal is to have a blue ball in room_2, with me in room_2 and in front of that ball. Also, there's a constraint that at some point I must be in room_1. Let me start by understanding the initial state and the available actions.

First, the initial state: I'm in room_4. The blue_ball_2 is in room_4. There's also blue_box_1 and purple_box_2 there. The doors are all locked initially. The relevant doors connecting rooms are purple_door_1 (room_1-room_2), grey_door_1 (room_1-room_3), green_door_1 (room_2-room_4), and yellow_door_1 (room_3-room_4). All doors are locked. So, to move between rooms, I need to unlock the doors first.

The goal requires a blue ball in room_2. Looking at the initial state, blue_ball_1 is in room_2 already. Wait, but the problem says "a ball v such that it's blue, in room_2, me in room_2, and in front of v." So maybe blue_ball_1 is already in room_2. But wait, the initial state says blue_ball_1 is in room_2. So maybe the goal is already partially satisfied. However, I need to be in room_2 and in front of blue_ball_1. But currently, I'm in room_4. So I need to get to room_2, and go in front of blue_ball_1. But wait, maybe the doors are locked, so I need to unlock them to move through.

But the constraint is that at some point, I must be in room_1. So even if the goal can be achieved without going to room_1, I need to include a step where I go to room_1. So my plan must include visiting room_1.

So possible steps: Starting in room_4, need to unlock doors to move towards room_2. Let's see the connections. From room_4, the connected rooms are room_2 (via green_door_1) and room_3 (via yellow_door_1). Both doors are locked. So first, I need to unlock green_door_1 or yellow_door_1.

Wait, to toggle a door, I need to be in front of it. To get in front of a door, I need to be in a room connected by that door. For example, green_door_1 connects room_2 and room_4. So if I'm in room_4, I can go to green_door_1. But to do that, the preconditions for "gotodoor" are: (i) in a room connected by d, and (ii) no object blocking the position in front of d in current room. Are there any objects blocking doors in room_4? The initial state says blue_box_1, purple_box_2, and blue_ball_2 are in room_4. But are any of them blocking the doors? The problem statement doesn't mention any initial blockages. So perhaps doors are not blocked by objects unless specified. Wait, the preconditions for "gotodoor" require that there's no object blocking the position in front of d in the current room. But the initial state doesn't mention any objects in front of doors. So maybe by default, doors are not blocked. So I can go to the door.

So steps to unlock green_door_1 (connecting room_4 and room_2):

1. In room_4, go to green_door_1 (using gotodoor green_door_1 room4 room2). Wait, the action is "gotodoor d r1 r2" where d is the door, and r1 and r2 are the connected rooms. Since I'm in room_4, which is connected to room_2 via green_door_1, the correct command would be "gotodoor green_door_1 room4 room2". Then, toggle the door to unlock it.

Once green_door_1 is unlocked, I can go from room_4 to room_2 via gotoroom room4 room2 green_door_1. Then, in room_2, I can gotoobject blue_ball_1 room2, pick it up, and drop it again (but why? Because the goal is to be in front of it. Wait, the goal is that there's a blue ball in room_2 (which it already is), me in room_2, and in front of it. So maybe I just need to go to room_2 and then gotoobject blue_ball_1. But then, the initial state already has blue_ball_1 in room_2. But I need to be in front of it. So steps would be: unlock green_door_1, go to room_2, goto blue_ball_1. That would satisfy the goal. However, the constraint requires that at some point I'm in room_1. So I need to go to room_1 during the plan.

So how to get to room_1? Let's see the connections. From room_2, the doors are purple_door_1 (to room_1) and green_door_1 (to room_4). Purple_door_1 is locked. So to get to room_1 from room_2, I need to unlock purple_door_1.

So here's the problem: To unlock purple_door_1, which is between room_1 and room_2, I need to be in front of it. If I'm in room_2, I can go to purple_door_1 (gotodoor purple_door_1 room2 room1), then toggle it to unlock. But then, to get to room_1, I can use gotoroom room2 room1 purple_door_1.

So here's a possible plan:

Start in room_4.

1. Unlock green_door_1 (room4 to room2 door):
   - gotodoor green_door_1 room4 room2
   - toggle green_door_1 (now unlocked)
   - gotoroom room4 room2 green_door_1 (move to room2)
2. Now in room2. Need to go to room1 to satisfy the constraint. So:
   - gotodoor purple_door_1 room2 room1
   - toggle purple_door_1 (unlock)
   - gotoroom room2 room1 purple_door_1 (move to room1)
3. Now in room1. This satisfies the constraint. Then, need to get back to room2 to achieve the goal. So:
   - gotodoor purple_door_1 room1 room2
   - toggle purple_door_1 (if it's locked again? Wait, after toggling, it was unlocked. Unless another toggle is done. But in step 2, we toggled it from locked to unlocked. So it's now unlocked. So no need to toggle again. So go back to room2 via purple_door_1.
   - gotoroom room1 room2 purple_door_1 (back to room2)
4. Now in room2. Then, gotoobject blue_ball_1 room2. Then the goal is satisfied.

But wait, the goal requires that I'm in front of a blue ball in room2. So after step 4, once in room2, I need to perform "gotoobject blue_ball_1 room2". That's the final action.

So let's outline the steps:

1. gotoempty (since initially, I'm in room4, but need to go to the door. Wait, the initial position isn't specified. The problem says "you are in room_4" but doesn't say where. So to go to a door, I need to use gotodoor. So first action: gotodoor green_door_1 room4 room2. Precondition: I'm in a room connected by green_door_1 (room4 is connected to room2 via green_door_1). Then, toggle green_door_1 to unlock. Then, gotoroom room4 room2 green_door_1.

Then, in room2, go to purple_door_1 (gotodoor purple_door_1 room2 room1), toggle it, then go to room1. That satisfies the constraint. Then return to room2 via purple_door_1. Then goto blue_ball_1 in room2.

But let's check each action's preconditions.

Starting in room4, not holding anything.

Action 1: gotodoor green_door_1 room4 room2. Preconditions: (i) in a room connected by d (room4 is connected via green_door_1 to room2), and (ii) no object blocking in front of d in current room. Assuming no blocking, this is allowed. Then, after this action, I'm in front of green_door_1.

Action 2: toggle green_door_1. Precondition: in front of green_door_1. So allowed. Effect: unlocks the door.

Action3: gotoroom room4 room2 green_door_1. Preconditions: (i) current room is room4 (adjacent to room2 via green_door_1), (ii) door is unlocked. After toggle, it's unlocked. So allowed. Now in room2.

Now in room2. Need to go to room1. So:

Action4: gotodoor purple_door_1 room2 room1. Precondition: in room2 (connected via purple_door_1). Assuming no blocking. Then in front of purple_door_1.

Action5: toggle purple_door_1. Now unlocks it.

Action6: gotoroom room2 room1 purple_door_1. Now in room1. This satisfies the constraint.

Then, need to return to room2. Since purple_door_1 is now unlocked.

Action7: gotodoor purple_door_1 room1 room2. Preconditions: in room1, which is connected via purple_door_1 to room2. No blocking.

Action8: toggle purple_door_1? Wait, no. After action5, the door was unlocked. If we toggle again, it would lock it. But we need to keep it unlocked to go back. So perhaps we shouldn't toggle again. So after action6 (in room1), to go back:

Action7: gotodoor purple_door_1 room1 room2 (since in room1, door connects to room2). Then, since door is unlocked, can use gotoroom room1 room2 purple_door_1.

Wait, no. After action6, we are in room1. To go back to room2, door is already unlocked. So steps:

Action7: gotodoor purple_door_1 room1 room2. Preconditions: in room1, which is connected via purple_door_1. Then, since door is unlocked, gotoroom room1 room2 purple_door_1.

So Action7: gotodoor purple_door_1 room1 room2.

Action8: gotoroom room1 room2 purple_door_1. Now back in room2.

Then, Action9: gotoobject blue_ball_1 room2. Preconditions: in room2, which we are. Then, now in front of blue_ball_1.

So the goal is achieved: in room2, in front of a blue ball (blue_ball_1), which is in room2. And the constraint is met by visiting room1 in action6.

Now let's check if this is the optimal plan. Are there shorter paths?

Alternative approach: From room4, maybe go through room3 to room1, then room2. But that might be longer.

Alternatively, after unlocking green_door_1 and going to room2, then unlock purple_door_1 and go to room1, then return. That's the path we outlined. Let's count the steps:

1. gotodoor green_door_1 room4 room2

2. toggle green_door_1

3. gotoroom room4 room2 green_door_1

4. gotodoor purple_door_1 room2 room1

5. toggle purple_door_1

6. gotoroom room2 room1 purple_door_1 (now in room1, satisfies constraint)

7. gotodoor purple_door_1 room1 room2

8. gotoroom room1 room2 purple_door_1 (back to room2)

9. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room2

That's 9 actions. Is there a shorter way?

Wait, perhaps after step3 (in room2), can I immediately go to room1 and then return, but maybe combining steps. Let's see:

Alternatively, after step3 (in room2), I need to unlock purple_door_1. Steps 4-5 (gotodoor, toggle). Then step6 (gotoroom to room1). Then step7 (gotodoor to room2), step8 (gotoroom to room2). Then step9 (gotoobject). So that's 9 steps.

Another possibility: After step3, when in room2, can I pick up the blue_ball_1 and drop it again? But why? Because the goal requires that the ball is in room2, which it already is. The only thing needed is to be in front of it. So no need to pick and drop.

Wait, but perhaps the agent is not in front of the ball. So after reaching room2, the agent is in room2 but not in front of the ball. So they need to perform "gotoobject blue_ball_1 room2". So that's step9.

Alternatively, could the agent, after step3, immediately gotoobject blue_ball_1? But they need to go to room1 at some point. So they have to make a detour to room1.

So the steps as before are necessary.

Is there a way to go to room1 without unlocking purple_door_1? For example, from room4, go to room3 via yellow_door_1, then to room1 via grey_door_1. Let's explore this.

Alternative plan:

1. In room4, unlock yellow_door_1 (room4 to room3). So:

Action1: gotodoor yellow_door_1 room4 room3.

Action2: toggle yellow_door_1 (unlocks it).

Action3: gotoroom room4 room3 yellow_door_1 (now in room3).

Then, from room3, unlock grey_door_1 (connecting room3 to room1):

Action4: gotodoor grey_door_1 room3 room1.

Action5: toggle grey_door_1.

Action6: gotoroom room3 room1 grey_door_1 (now in room1, satisfying constraint).

Then, from room1, need to get to room2. So unlock purple_door_1:

Action7: gotodoor purple_door_1 room1 room2.

Action8: toggle purple_door_1.

Action9: gotoroom room1 room2 purple_door_1 (now in room2).

Then Action10: gotoobject blue_ball_1 room2.

But this plan has 10 actions, which is longer than the previous plan. So the first approach is better.

Therefore, the initial plan of 9 actions is better.

Wait, but maybe there's a shorter path. Let's see:

After step6 in the first plan (in room1), can we go back to room2 without toggling the door again? Because once unlocked, it stays unlocked. So after step5 (toggle purple_door_1), the door is unlocked. So from room1, to go back to room2:

Action7: gotodoor purple_door_1 room1 room2.

Action8: gotoroom room1 room2 purple_door_1.

That's two actions. Then, Action9: gotoobject.

So total steps: 1. gotodoor green_door_1 room4 room2

2. toggle green_door_1

3. gotoroom room4 room2 green_door_1

4. gotodoor purple_door_1 room2 room1

5. toggle purple_door_1

6. gotoroom room2 room1 purple_door_1 (now in room1)

7. gotodoor purple_door_1 room1 room2

8. gotoroom room1 room2 purple_door_1 (back to room2)

9. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room2

Total of 9 actions.

Is there a way to combine steps or make it shorter?

Wait, after step3 (in room2), if I can go to room1 via purple_door_1, but it's locked. So steps 4-5 are needed to unlock it. Then steps 6 to room1, then steps 7-8 to come back. So no way around that.

Alternatively, maybe after step3 (in room2), can I pick up the blue_ball_1 and take it with me to room1, then bring it back? But the goal is to have it in room2. If I pick it up and drop it again in room2, that's unnecessary steps. But the initial state has blue_ball_1 already in room2. So no need to move it. But the agent needs to be in front of it. So the steps are necessary.

Alternatively, perhaps using another blue ball. There's blue_ball_2 in room4. But the goal requires a blue ball in room2. So if I take blue_ball_2 to room2, then drop it there, and be in front of it, that's another way. Let's see:

Plan B:

1. In room4, unlock green_door_1:

   gotodoor green_door_1 room4 room2

   toggle green_door_1

   gotoroom room4 room2 green_door_1

2. Now in room2. Need to go to room1 for constraint. So unlock purple_door_1:

   gotodoor purple_door_1 room2 room1

   toggle purple_door_1

   gotoroom room2 room1 purple_door_1

3. Now in room1. Satisfy constraint.

4. Return to room2:

   gotodoor purple_door_1 room1 room2

   gotoroom room1 room2 purple_door_1

5. Now in room2. gotoobject blue_ball_1. So total 9 steps as before.

But if I take blue_ball_2 from room4 to room2, maybe:

Alternative Plan C:

1. In room4, unlock green_door_1:

   gotodoor green_door_1 room4 room2

   toggle green_door_1

   gotoroom room4 room2 green_door_1

2. Now in room2. Need to go to room1.

   gotodoor purple_door_1 room2 room1

   toggle purple_door_1

   gotoroom room2 room1 purple_door_1

3. Now in room1. Then return to room2 via purple_door_1 (actions 7-8 as before).

4. Now in room2. gotoobject blue_ball_1. Same as before.

So same steps. Alternatively, perhaps using another path to room1 via room3 and room4.

But that would require more steps. For example:

From room4, unlock yellow_door_1 to room3, then unlock grey_door_1 to room1, then go to room1. Then proceed to room2 via purple_door_1. But this would require more steps.

Thus, the initial plan seems optimal with 9 steps.

Now, check if all preconditions are met in each step.

Step 1: gotodoor green_door_1 room4 room2. In room4, which is connected via green_door_1. No objects blocking. So allowed.

Step2: toggle green_door_1. Must be in front of it. After step1, agent is in front of green_door_1. So allowed. Now door is unlocked.

Step3: gotoroom room4 room2 green_door_1. Current room is room4, door is unlocked. Allowed. Now in room2.

Step4: gotodoor purple_door_1 room2 room1. In room2, connected via purple_door_1. No blocking. Allowed. Now in front of purple_door_1.

Step5: toggle purple_door_1. In front of it. Allowed. Now unlocked.

Step6: gotoroom room2 room1 purple_door_1. Current room is room2, door is unlocked. Now in room1.

Step7: gotodoor purple_door_1 room1 room2. In room1, connected via purple_door_1. Allowed. Now in front of door.

Step8: gotoroom room1 room2 purple_door_1. Door is unlocked. Allowed. Now back in room2.

Step9: gotoobject blue_ball_1 room2. In room2, which is where blue_ball_1 is. Allowed. Now in front of blue_ball_1.

All steps meet preconditions. The goal is achieved: blue_ball_1 is in room2, agent in room2, in front of it. The constraint is met because step6 puts agent in room1.

This plan has 9 actions. Let's see if there's a shorter plan.

Alternative Idea: After unlocking green_door_1 and going to room2, instead of unlocking purple_door_1, maybe go back to room4, unlock another door to room3, and go to room1 via room3. But that would require more steps.

Another Idea: Can the agent visit room1 after the goal is achieved? For example, go to room2, achieve the goal, then go to room1. But the constraint requires that at least one state (i.e., at least one step) has the agent in room1. So after achieving the goal, if the agent then goes to room1, that would satisfy the constraint. But in this case, the goal requires the agent to be in room2. So the final state must have the agent in room2. So any movement to room1 must be done before achieving the goal.

Alternatively, the steps could be:

1. Go to room2 via green_door_1 (unlock, etc.), then goto blue_ball_1 (achieving the goal), then go to room1. But then the final state requires the agent to be in room2. So the agent can't leave after achieving the goal. Therefore, the agent must visit room1 before the final steps.

Hence, the initial plan is correct.
