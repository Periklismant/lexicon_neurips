Alright, let's analyze this planning problem step by step.

The goal is:
"There is a door d such that 'The following conditions are all true: d is blue, room_4 and room_2 are connected via d, you are in front of d, d is not locked'"

From the world description, I can see that there are two blue doors:
- blue_door_1, which connects room_1 and room_2
- blue_door_2, which connects room_2 and room_4

Since the goal specifies that the door connects room_4 and room_2, the door d must be blue_door_2.

So, the goal translates to:
- blue_door_2 is blue (already true in the initial state)
- room_4 and room_2 are connected via blue_door_2 (already true in the initial state)
- you are in front of blue_door_2
- blue_door_2 is not locked (initially, it is locked)

The constraints are:
1. At some point, blue_door_2 must be unlocked.
2. Before unlocking blue_door_2, I must be in front of green_door_1 at an earlier state.

Let me make sense of the current state:
- I am in room_2.
- All doors are locked.
- blue_door_2 connects room_2 and room_4.
- green_door_1 connects room_3 and room_4.

To achieve the goal, I need to:
1. Unlock blue_door_2 by using the toggle action.
2. To do this, I must first stand in front of blue_door_2.
3. But before doing that, I must first stand in front of green_door_1, which is in either room_3 or room_4.

So, I need to get to green_door_1 first. Let's see how I can get there:

Starting in room_2:
- I can potentially go to room_1 via blue_door_1 or to room_4 via blue_door_2.
- But both doors are locked.

Hmm, it seems like I'm trapped in room_2 because all doors are locked. Let me re-read the domain description to see if there's a workaround.

I notice that the "toggle" action allows me to unlock a door if I'm in front of it. So, I can unlock blue_door_1, then go to room_1, and so on.

Here's a strategy:
1. Go in front of blue_door_1 in room_2.
2. Toggle blue_door_1 to unlock it.
3. Go to room_1 via blue_door_1.
4. Go in front of red_door_1 in room_1.
5. Toggle red_door_1 to unlock it.
6. Go to room_3 via red_door_1.
7. Go in front of green_door_1 in room_3.
8. Toggle green_door_1 to unlock it.
9. Go to room_4, which is connected to room_3 via green_door_1.
10. Go in front of blue_door_2 in room_4.
11. Toggle blue_door_2 to unlock it.
12. Go to room_2 via blue_door_2.
13. Go in front of blue_door_2 in room_2.

Wait, I think I've made a mistake in my reasoning. Let me re-read the conditions.

Conditions state:
- "If expression 'blue_door_2 is not locked' holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: 'you are in front of green_door_1'"

This means that before unlocking blue_door_2, I must first be in front of green_door_1 at an earlier state.

Now, the goal requires me to be in front of blue_door_2, and for blue_door_2 to be unlocked. But the goal doesn't require me to be the one who unlocks blue_door_2. The constraint only specifies the order: I must be in front of green_door_1 at some state before blue_door_2 is unlocked.

Actually, I'm still confused, but let me try to think through this plan clearly.

I'm in room_2.
- blue_door_1 connects room_2 to room_1 (locked).
- blue_door_2 connects room_2 to room_4 (locked).

To achieve the goal (being in front of an unlocked blue_door_2 that connects room_4 and room_2), I need to:
1. Make sure blue_door_2 is unlocked.
2. Position myself in front of blue_door_2.

Additionally, from the constraints, before blue_door_2 is unlocked, I must be in front of green_door_1 which connects room_3 and room_4.

I think my earlier strategy is on the right track.

Let's try again, starting from room_2:
1. Go in front of blue_door_1 in room_2.
2. Toggle blue_door_1 to unlock it.
3. Go to room_1 via blue_door_1.
4. Go in front of red_door_1 in room_1.
5. Toggle red_door_1 to unlock it.
6. Go to room_3 via red_door_1.
7. Go in front of green_door_1 in room_3. (This satisfies the constraint).
8. Toggle green_door_1 to unlock it.
9. Go to room_4 via green_door_1.
10. Go in front of blue_door_2 in room_4.
11. Toggle blue_door_2 to unlock it. (Now blue_door_2 is unlocked, and earlier I was in front of green_door_1).
12. Go back to room_2 via blue_door_2.
13. Go in front of blue_door_2 in room_2. (Now I am in front of an unlocked blue_door_2, satisfying the goal).

But wait, if I'm in room_2 and go in front of blue_door_2, I'm already in front of an unlocked blue_door_2 in step 13. Do I need to go back to room_2?

Let me rethink this. The goal is to be in front of an unlocked blue_door_2 that connects room_4 and room_2. If I'm in room_4 and I'm in front of blue_door_2, then I'm already at a blue door that connects room_4 and room_2.

But I need to check the exact wording of the goal:
"There is a door d such that 'The following conditions are all true: d is blue, room_4 and room_2 are connected via d, you are in front of d, d is not locked'"

The goal doesn't specify which room I need to be in, just that I need to be in front of a blue door that connects room_4 and room_2 and is not locked.

So, it seems like I can achieve the goal by being in either room_2 or room_4, as long as I'm in front of blue_door_2 and it's unlocked.

Given this, I can simplify the plan:
1. Go in front of blue_door_1 in room_2.
2. Toggle blue_door_1 to unlock it.
3. Go to room_1 via blue_door_1.
4. Go in front of red_door_1 in room_1.
5. Toggle red_door_1 to unlock it.
6. Go to room_3 via red_door_1.
7. Go in front of green_door_1 in room_3. (This satisfies the constraint).
8. Toggle green_door_1 to unlock it.
9. Go to room_4 via green_door_1.
10. Go in front of blue_door_2 in room_4.
11. Toggle blue_door_2 to unlock it. (Now blue_door_2 is unlocked, and earlier I was in front of green_door_1).

This plan seems to satisfy the goal and the constraints. But maybe I got confused about the directions, the constraints or the goal. Let me reconsider the whole problem.

I think maybe I'm confused by the constraint. Let me re-read it:

"If expression 'blue_door_2 is not locked' holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: 'you are in front of green_door_1'"

This means that before blue_door_2 is unlocked, I must stand in front of green_door_1. There's no requirement that I personally unlock blue_door_2. It just needs to be unlocked, and before it is, I should have been in front of green_door_1.

Now, green_door_1 connects room_3 and room_4. So I need to be in either room_3 or room_4 to get in front of it.

Let me reconsider the strategy from the beginning:

1. I'm in room_2.
2. To get to green_door_1, I need to first go to either room_3 or room_4.
3. Both blue_door_1 (room_2 to room_1) and blue_door_2 (room_2 to room_4) are locked.
4. I need to unlock at least one door to get out of room_2.

The constraint states that I need to stand in front of green_door_1 before blue_door_2 is unlocked. So, I must find a path to green_door_1 that doesn't involve unlocking blue_door_2.

Here's a potential path:
- From room_2, unlock blue_door_1 (which connects room_1 and room_2).
- Go to room_1.
- Unlock red_door_1 (which connects room_1 and room_3).
- Go to room_3.
- Stand in front of green_door_1 (which connects room_3 and room_4).
- Unlock green_door_1.
- Go to room_4.
- Stand in front of blue_door_2 (which connects room_2 and room_4).
- Unlock blue_door_2.
- Now, from room_4, I'm in front of an unlocked blue_door_2 that connects room_4 and room_2.

This seems to satisfy the goal and the constraint. Let me outline the detailed plan using the actions:

1. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1 (I go in front of blue_door_1 which connects room_2 and room_1)
2. toggle blue_door_1 (I unlock blue_door_1)
3. gotoroom room_2 room_1 blue_door_1 (I go from room_2 to room_1)
4. gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3 (I go in front of red_door_1 which connects room_1 and room_3)
5. toggle red_door_1 (I unlock red_door_1)
6. gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1 (I go from room_1 to room_3)
7. gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4 (I go in front of green_door_1 which connects room_3 and room_4, satisfying the constraint)
8. toggle green_door_1 (I unlock green_door_1)
9. gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_1 (I go from room_3 to room_4)
10. gotodoor blue_door_2 room_4 room_2 (I go in front of blue_door_2 which connects room_4 and room_2)
11. toggle blue_door_2 (I unlock blue_door_2, and at this point, I've already been in front of green_door_1)

And at this point, I satisfy the goal: I'm in front of blue_door_2, which is blue, connects room_4 and room_2, and is unlocked.

Wait, let me make sure I'm using the correct action names and formats according to the defined actions.

The action "gotodoor d r1 r2" means go in front of door d connecting room r1 to room r2.
The action "gotoroom r1 r2 d" means go from room r1 to room r2 using door d.

1. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1 (I go in front of blue_door_1 which connects room_2 and room_1)
2. toggle blue_door_1 (I unlock blue_door_1)
3. gotoroom room_2 room_1 blue_door_1 (I go from room_2 to room_1)
4. gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3 (I go in front of red_door_1 which connects room_1 and room_3)
5. toggle red_door_1 (I unlock red_door_1)
6. gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1 (I go from room_1 to room_3)
7. gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4 (I go in front of green_door_1 which connects room_3 and room_4, satisfying the constraint)
8. toggle green_door_1 (I unlock green_door_1)
9. gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_1 (I go from room_3 to room_4)
10. gotodoor blue_door_2 room_4 room_2 (I go in front of blue_door_2 which connects room_4 and room_2)
11. toggle blue_door_2 (I unlock blue_door_2, and at this point, I've already been in front of green_door_1)

Actually, I think I'm using the action names correctly. Let me trace that this plan achieves the goal and the constraints.

Goal: "There is a door d such that 'The following conditions are all true: d is blue, room_4 and room_2 are connected via d, you are in front of d, d is not locked'"

After following the 11 steps above, I will be:
- In front of blue_door_2 (step 10).
- blue_door_2 is blue (as given in the initial state).
- room_4 and room_2 are connected via blue_door_2 (as given in the initial state).
- blue_door_2 is not locked (because I unlocked it in step 11).

So, the goal is satisfied.

Constraints:
1. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: blue_door_2 is not locked". This is satisfied after step 11.
2. "If expression 'blue_door_2 is not locked' holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: 'you are in front of green_door_1'". This is satisfied because in step 7, I'm in front of green_door_1, which happens before step 11, which is when blue_door_2 becomes unlocked.

So, the plan satisfied both the goal and the constraints.

I think this is the correct answer: an 11-step plan that satisfies the goal and constraints. Let me see if I can optimize it further.

Actually, this is already a very direct path to the goal. Given the constraints, we need to stand in front of green_door_1 before unlocking blue_door_2, and to get to green_door_1, we need to first unlock blue_door_1 and red_door_1. So, I think this plan is already optimal.

Let me list the plan once more:

1. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1
2. toggle blue_door_1
3. gotoroom room_2 room_1 blue_door_1
4. gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3
5. toggle red_door_1
6. gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1
7. gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4
8. toggle green_door_1
9. gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_1
10. gotodoor blue_door_2 room_4 room_2
11. toggle blue_door_2

This is the optimal plan for the given problem.
