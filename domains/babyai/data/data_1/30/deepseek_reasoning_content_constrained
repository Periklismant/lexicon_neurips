Okay, let's try to figure out this planning problem. So the goal is to have a blue door connecting room_4 and room_2, which is unlocked, and I need to be in front of it. The door in question here is blue_door_2 because that's the one connecting room_4 and room_2. Also, there's a constraint that at some point, blue_door_2 must be unlocked, and before that, I must have been in front of green_door_1.

Starting in room_2. All doors are locked initially. So first, I need to unlock blue_door_2. But to unlock it, I have to toggle it, which requires being in front of it. However, blue_door_2 connects room_2 and room_4. Since I'm in room_2, I can go to the door if it's not blocked. Wait, the preconditions for "gotodoor d r1 r2" say I need to be in a room connected by d, and there's no object blocking the position in front of d. Are there any objects blocking blue_door_2 in room_2? The initial state lists objects in room_2 as purple_ball_1 and blue_ball_1. Unless they are in front of the door, which I don't know. But the problem doesn't mention any objects blocking doors initially. Maybe assuming they aren't blocking.

So, steps could be: go to blue_door_2 in room_2, toggle it to unlock. Then, since the goal is to be in front of it and have it unlocked, that might be part of the solution. But wait, the goal is a door d that is blue, connects room_4 and room_2, you're in front of it, and it's not locked. So blue_door_2 is the only candidate. So the plan needs to end with being in front of blue_door_2 (in room_2 or room_4?), and blue_door_2 being unlocked.

Wait, the doors are two-way. So blue_door_2 connects room_2 and room_4. So being in front of it in room_2 or room_4? The goal says "you are in front of d", so either room is okay as long as you're in front of d. But after unlocking, to be in front of it again. Let's see.

But there's a constraint: the plan must have at least one state where blue_door_2 is not locked, and before that state, there must be a state where I'm in front of green_door_1. So I need to go to green_door_1 at some point before unlocking blue_door_2.

Green_door_1 connects room_3 and room_4. But I'm starting in room_2. How to get to green_door_1? Let's think about the path.

From room_2, the connected doors are blue_door_1 (to room_1) and blue_door_2 (to room_4). But all doors are locked. So I can't go through them unless I unlock them. Wait, but to unlock a door, I need to be in front of it. So to unlock blue_door_2, I have to be in room_2 and go to the door (gotodoor blue_door_2 room_2 room_4), then toggle it. But can I get to the door even if the door is locked? The "gotodoor" action's precondition is that you are in a room connected by the door and that the position in front of the door isn't blocked. Since the door is locked, but the action is just moving in front of it, not passing through. So yes, I can go to the door even if it's locked. Then toggle to unlock it. But according to the constraint, before unlocking blue_door_2, I need to have been in front of green_door_1. So how to get to green_door_1?

Wait, green_door_1 is between room_3 and room_4. To get there from room_2, I need to go through other doors. Let's see possible paths:

room_2 → via blue_door_2 to room_4 (but it's locked initially). Alternatively, room_2 → blue_door_1 to room_1 (locked). Or room_2 → blue_door_2 (locked). So all doors are locked. So maybe I need to unlock doors in a certain order.

Wait, but the only way to unlock a door is to be in front of it. So I can't move to another room unless I unlock the door first. Wait, no. The gotoroom action requires that the door is unlocked. So to move from room_2 to room_4 via blue_door_2, the door must be unlocked. But to unlock it, I need to be in front of it while in room_2, then toggle it. So the initial steps would be:

1. gotoempty (to be in front of an empty spot in room_2, maybe not necessary, but to get out of any current position)
2. gotodoor blue_door_2 room_2 room_4
3. toggle blue_door_2 (unlocking it)
But according to the constraint, before unlocking blue_door_2, I must have been in front of green_door_1. But how can I get to green_door_1 from room_2 if all doors are locked? Unless there's another path. Let's see:

Wait, maybe there's a way to go from room_2 to room_4 via blue_door_2 (but locked), but to unlock blue_door_2, I need to be in front of it. So unlock blue_door_2 first, then go to room_4. Then from room_4, go to room_3 via green_door_1 (but it's locked). Then unlock green_door_1 by being in front of it in room_4. Then go to room_3, etc. But the constraint says that before unlocking blue_door_2, I need to have been in front of green_door_1. So this approach would not satisfy the constraint because unlocking blue_door_2 happens before going to green_door_1.

Hmm. So I need to somehow get to green_door_1 before unlocking blue_door_2. But all doors are locked. So perhaps the only way is to use other doors that can be unlocked without needing to go through them.

Wait, but how can I unlock a door if I can't reach it? For example, green_door_1 is between room_3 and room_4. To get to green_door_1, I need to be in either room_3 or room_4. But I'm starting in room_2. To get to room_4, I need to go through blue_door_2, which is locked. So unless I unlock blue_door_2 first, which would violate the constraint because the constraint requires that before unlocking blue_door_2, I was in front of green_door_1. But that seems impossible. Wait, maybe there's a different approach. Let me check the doors again.

Original doors:

- blue_door_1 connects room_1 and room_2 (locked)
- red_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3 (locked)
- blue_door_2 connects room_2 and room_4 (locked)
- green_door_1 connects room_3 and room_4 (locked)

So starting in room_2, all doors are locked. The only doors in room_2 are blue_door_1 (to room_1) and blue_door_2 (to room_4). But both are locked. To unlock any door, I have to be in front of it. So perhaps I can unlock blue_door_2 first (but the constraint says that before unlocking it, I must have been in front of green_door_1. Which seems impossible unless there's a way to teleport or something, which there isn't. Therefore, this seems like a contradiction. Wait, maybe there's a misunderstanding here.

Wait the constraint says that if blue_door_2 is unlocked in some state, then there must be an earlier state where I was in front of green_door_1. So the unlocking of blue_door_2 must happen after being in front of green_door_1. But how can I get to green_door_1 if all doors are locked?

Wait, maybe the only way is to first unlock some other doors to get to green_door_1. Let's think. For example, perhaps I can unlock blue_door_1 (connecting room_1 and room_2), go to room_1, then unlock red_door_1 (connecting room_1 and room_3), go to room_3, then go to green_door_1 in room_3, which connects to room_4. But green_door_1 is locked. Then toggle it, unlock it, then go to room_4. From room_4, maybe go to blue_door_2, unlock it. But then, in this case, the unlocking of blue_door_2 would happen after being in front of green_door_1. Let's outline this path.

Steps:

1. In room_2, go to blue_door_1 (room_2 side). But blue_door_1 is locked. Wait, but to unlock blue_door_1, I need to be in front of it. So:

1. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1 (precondition: in room connected by the door, which is room_2, and no object blocking. Assuming no blocking.)

2. toggle blue_door_1 (unlocks it)

3. gotoroom room_2 room_1 blue_door_1 (now in room_1)

4. In room_1, go to red_door_1 (which connects to room_3). So gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3.

5. toggle red_door_1 (unlock it)

6. gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1 (now in room_3)

7. In room_3, go to green_door_1 (connecting to room_4). gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4.

8. toggle green_door_1 (unlock it)

9. gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_1 (now in room_4)

10. Now in room_4, need to go to blue_door_2 (which connects to room_2). gotodoor blue_door_2 room_4 room_2.

11. toggle blue_door_2 (unlock it)

But wait, according to the problem's original state, blue_door_2 is locked. So step 11 would unlock it. Then, after that, the goal requires being in front of blue_door_2 and it being unlocked. So step 10 and 11 would get me in front of blue_door_2 in room_4, then unlock it. But then, the goal is to be in front of d (blue_door_2) in some room. So after step 10, I'm in front of blue_door_2 in room_4. Then after step 11, it's unlocked. So that's one state where blue_door_2 is not locked. But according to the constraint, whenever blue_door_2 is not locked in some state, there must be an earlier state where I was in front of green_door_1. In this case, step 7 (gotodoor green_door_1) and step 8 (toggle green_door_1) would have been in front of green_door_1. So step 7 would satisfy the "you are in front of green_door_1" before step 11, which toggles blue_door_2. So this seems to satisfy the constraint.

But then, after step 11, blue_door_2 is unlocked. But the goal is to be in front of it. So after step 10, I was in front of blue_door_2 (room_4 side). Then step 11 toggles it to unlocked. Then the next action could be to gotoempty or something, but the goal requires being in front of d (blue_door_2) and d is not locked. So perhaps after step 11, I can just stay in front of blue_door_2. Because after toggling, the door is unlocked. So the final state would be in front of blue_door_2 (in room_4) with it unlocked. So the plan would be steps 1-11, then possibly nothing else. Let me check.

Wait, after step 10, you are in front of blue_door_2 in room_4. Then step 11 toggles it, making it unlocked. So the state after step 11 would have you in front of blue_door_2, which is now unlocked. That satisfies the goal: there exists a door d (blue_door_2) that is blue, connects room_4 and room_2, you are in front of it, and it's not locked.

So the plan would be:

1. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1
2. toggle blue_door_1
3. gotoroom room_2 room_1 blue_door_1
4. gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3
5. toggle red_door_1
6. gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1
7. gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4
8. toggle green_door_1
9. gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_1
10. gotodoor blue_door_2 room_4 room_2
11. toggle blue_door_2

This would satisfy the constraints. Because step 8 toggles green_door_1 (so you were in front of it in step 7), and step 11 unlocks blue_door_2. So the constraint is that in the state where blue_door_2 is unlocked (after step 11), there was an earlier state (step 7) where you were in front of green_door_1. Yes, that works.

But wait, the initial plan's steps need to be checked for preconditions. Let me verify each step:

1. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1: preconditions: in room_2 (yes), door connects room_2 and room_1 (yes), no object blocking. Assuming no blocking, so valid.

2. toggle blue_door_1: preconditions: in front of blue_door_1. After step 1, you are in front of it. So yes.

3. gotoroom room_2 room_1 blue_door_1: preconditions: in room_2 (after step 2, you are still in room_2?), wait after gotodoor, you are in front of the door but still in the same room. So after step 1, you're in room_2, in front of blue_door_1. Step 2 toggles the door, unlocking it. Step 3: gotoroom from room_2 to room_1 via blue_door_1. Since blue_door_1 is now unlocked, this is allowed. So valid.

4. gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3: in room_1, red_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3. So valid if no blocking.

5. toggle red_door_1: now in front of red_door_1, so allowed. Unlocks it.

6. gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1: door is now unlocked, so valid.

7. gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4: in room_3, green_door_1 connects to room_4. Valid.

8. toggle green_door_1: unlock it.

9. gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_1: door is unlocked, valid.

10. gotodoor blue_door_2 room_4 room_2: in room_4, blue_door_2 connects to room_2. Valid.

11. toggle blue_door_2: unlock it.

After step 11, blue_door_2 is unlocked, and you're in front of it. So the goal is satisfied.

The constraints are:

- At least one state where blue_door_2 is not locked. That's step 11.

- If blue_door_2 is not locked in some state, there's an earlier state where you were in front of green_door_1. That's step 7 (when you were in front of green_door_1 in room_3 before step 8). So this satisfies the constraint.

So this plan should work. Let me check if there's a shorter plan. For example, is there a way to avoid going through room_1 and room_3?

Alternative approach: Since the constraint requires being in front of green_door_1 before unlocking blue_door_2, but green_door_1 is in room_3 or room_4. To get to green_door_1, perhaps there's a shorter path. Let's see.

But starting in room_2, all doors are locked. So you can't get to room_4 unless you unlock blue_door_2, but that's the door you need to unlock after being in front of green_door_1. So maybe you have to take the long route. Alternatively, maybe there's a way to go from room_2 to room_4 via another door once some other doors are unlocked. But given the connections, room_2 is connected to room_1 and room_4. Room_1 is connected to room_3. Room_3 is connected to room_4. So the only path to room_3 is through room_1. So the path seems necessary.

Thus, the steps outlined are probably the optimal. The length is 11 steps. Is there a way to make it shorter?

Wait, after step 3, you are in room_1. Then steps 4-6 get you to room_3. Steps 7-9 to room_4. Then 10-11 to blue_door_2. Let's see if any steps can be combined or removed. For example, after unlocking blue_door_2, do you need to do anything else? The goal is to be in front of it and have it unlocked. So after step 10 and 11, you are in front of blue_door_2 and it's unlocked. So that's sufficient.

So the plan is 11 steps. Is there a shorter way? Let's think.

Alternative idea: Instead of unlocking blue_door_1 and red_door_1, maybe there's a way to get to green_door_1 through room_4 via blue_door_2. But blue_door_2 is initially locked. To unlock it, you have to be in front of it. But if you do that, then you would have to go to green_door_1 afterwards. But the constraint requires that unlocking blue_door_2 happens after being in front of green_door_1. So this seems impossible. Because to unlock blue_door_2 first would violate the constraint.

Wait, suppose you do:

1. gotodoor blue_door_2 room_2 room_4

2. toggle blue_door_2 (unlock it)

But according to the constraint, before unlocking blue_door_2 (step 2), you must have been in front of green_door_1. Which hasn't happened yet. So this plan is invalid.

Therefore, the only way is to take the longer path through room_1, room_3, and room_4.

Thus, the plan length of 11 actions is necessary. But maybe there's a shorter path. Let me see:

Wait, after unlocking blue_door_1, you go to room_1. Then unlock red_door_1, go to room_3. Then unlock green_door_1, go to room_4. Then unlock blue_door_2. But maybe you can combine some steps. For example, after step 9 (in room_4), you need to go to blue_door_2. So step 10 is gotodoor blue_door_2 room_4 room_2. Then step 11 is toggle. So that's two steps. So total steps: 11. Is there a way to reduce this?

Alternatively, when in room_4, maybe after step 9, you can do gotodoor blue_door_2 and toggle in the same room. But that's still two steps. So no. So the plan must be 11 steps. I think that's the minimal possible. Hence, the answer is the 11-step plan as outlined.
