```
gotoempty
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_4
toggle yellow_door_1
gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_1
gotoobject purple_box_2 room_4
```
``` 

Explanation of the plan:

1. **gotoempty**: Clears any potential front position since the agent starts in room_3 without specified front position
2. **gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_4**: Positions the agent in front of the locked yellow door connecting room_3 to room_4
3. **toggle yellow_door_1**: Unlocks the yellow door to enable movement between rooms
4. **gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_1**: Moves the agent to room_4 through the now-unlocked door
5. **gotoobject purple_box_2 room_4**: Positions the agent in front of the pre-existing purple box (purple_box_2) in room_4, satisfying all goal conditions

This plan is optimal with 5 actions, directly utilizing the shortest path through the yellow door to reach the target room and box.
