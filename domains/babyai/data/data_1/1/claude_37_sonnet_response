Alright, I'm given a grid world planning problem with rooms, doors, boxes, and a ball. Let me understand the problem:

We have:
- 4 rooms laid out in a square: room_1 (NW), room_2 (SW), room_3 (NE), room_4 (SE)
- Doors connecting the rooms:
  - room_1 and room_2 via purple_door_1
  - room_1 and room_3 via grey_door_1
  - room_2 and room_4 via blue_door_1
  - room_3 and room_4 via yellow_door_1
- Various colored boxes and a blue ball
- All doors are locked initially

I start in room_3 and the goal is to have a purple box in room_4, to be in room_4, and to be in front of a purple box.

However, there's also a constraint: at some point, I need to be holding the blue ball.

Now, let's think about this. 

First, I check: are there any purple boxes? Looking at the objects, I see:
- `purple_box_1 is in room_2` and `purple_box_1 is purple`
- `purple_box_2 is in room_4` and `purple_box_2 is purple`

So there are two purple boxes: one in room_2 and one in room_4. Since purple_box_2 is already in room_4, and my goal state is to be in room_4 in front of a purple box, it seems most efficient to go to room_4 and stand in front of purple_box_2.

To get there, I could go from room_3 to room_4 via yellow_door_1. But yellow_door_1 is locked, and I need to toggle it.

Also, there's a constraint: I need to hold the blue ball at some point. The blue ball (blue_ball_1) is in room_2. So I'll need to go to room_2 first, pick up the blue ball, and then continue to room_4.

Let's start planning:

1. I'm in room_3. I need to go to room_2 via room_1, since the doors from room_3 are all locked.
2. From room_3, I need to go to room_1 through grey_door_1. I'll need to toggle grey_door_1 first.
3. From room_1, I'll go to room_2 through purple_door_1. I'll need to toggle purple_door_1 first.
4. In room_2, I'll pick up blue_ball_1 to satisfy the constraint.
5. From room_2, I'll go to room_4 through blue_door_1. I'll need to toggle blue_door_1 first.
6. In room_4, I'll drop blue_ball_1 (since I only need to hold it at some point, not at the end).
7. Finally, I'll go in front of purple_box_2 in room_4.

Now, let's refine this plan by detailing the steps more:

Actually, I realize I started planning without fully understanding the actions' preconditions and effects. Let me review the actions:

- `gotoobject x r`: Go in front of object x in room r. Precondition: I'm in room r.
- `gotoempty`: Go in front of an empty position.
- `gotodoor d r1 r2`: Go in front of door d, which connects room r1 and room r2. Precondition: I'm in a room that door d connects with another room and no object is blocking the door.
- `gotoroom r1 r2 d`: Go from room r1 to room r2 using door d. Preconditions: I'm in room r1, r2 is adjacent to r1, and the door connecting them is unlocked.
- `pick x r`: Pick up object x in room r. Preconditions: I'm in room r, I'm in front of x, and my hands are empty.
- `drop x r`: Drop object x in room r. Preconditions: I'm holding x, and the position in front of me is empty.
- `toggle d`: Toggle door d's lock status. Precondition: I'm in front of door d.

So, I need to be in front of a door to toggle it, and I can only go to a different room if the door connecting them is unlocked.

With that understanding, let's revise the plan:

1. I'm in room_3. I need to go in front of grey_door_1, toggle it, and then use it to go to room_1.
2. From room_1, I'll go in front of purple_door_1, toggle it, and then use it to go to room_2.
3. In room_2, I'll go in front of blue_ball_1, pick it up, then go in front of blue_door_1, toggle it, and go to room_4.
4. In room_4, I'll drop blue_ball_1 and go in front of purple_box_2.

Actually, I made a mistake here. The constraint says I need to hold the blue ball at some point, but I don't need to take it to room_4. But since I need to visit room_2 to get to room_4 from room_3 (because I need to pass through room_1 and room_2 to reach room_4, unless I can directly use yellow_door_1 from room_3 to room_4), I'll pick up the blue ball in room_2 and drop it before moving to room_4.

Wait, I think I misunderstood again. Let's see the exact connections between rooms:

- room_1 and room_2 are connected via purple_door_1
- room_1 and room_3 are connected via grey_door_1
- room_2 and room_4 are connected via blue_door_1
- room_3 and room_4 are connected via yellow_door_1

So, from room_3, I can directly go to room_4 via yellow_door_1 or to room_1 via grey_door_1. To satisfy the constraint of holding the blue ball at some point, I'd need to go to room_2 where the blue ball is. I could go from room_3 to room_1, then to room_2, pick up the blue ball, drop it, then go back to room_1, then to room_3, and finally to room_4. Or I could go from room_3 to room_1, then to room_2, pick up the blue ball, then go directly to room_4 via blue_door_1, and drop the ball there.

Let me think about this more carefully. I'll list the current locations of objects and the current state:

- I am in room_3
- blue_box_1 is in room_1
- green_box_1, blue_ball_1, and purple_box_1 are in room_2
- green_box_2, grey_box_1, and grey_box_2 are in room_3
- purple_box_2 is in room_4
- All doors are locked

Since I'm trying to reach a purple box in room_4, and purple_box_2 is already in room_4, it makes more sense to go directly to room_4 from room_3 via yellow_door_1 after unlocking it.

But, there's the constraint about holding the blue ball. So, I'd need to go to room_2 at some point, pick up the blue ball, then make my way to room_4.

The most efficient path would be:
1. room_3 -> room_1 (via grey_door_1)
2. room_1 -> room_2 (via purple_door_1)
3. pick up blue_ball_1 in room_2
4. room_2 -> room_4 (via blue_door_1)
5. drop blue_ball_1 in room_4
6. go in front of purple_box_2 in room_4

Let me now detail the plan with the specific actions:

1. `gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1`: Go in front of the grey door in room_3 that connects to room_1.
2. `toggle grey_door_1`: Unlock the grey door.
3. `gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1`: Go from room_3 to room_1 through the grey door.
4. `gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2`: Go in front of the purple door in room_1 that connects to room_2.
5. `toggle purple_door_1`: Unlock the purple door.
6. `gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1`: Go from room_1 to room_2 through the purple door.
7. `gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_2`: Go in front of the blue ball in room_2.
8. `pick blue_ball_1 room_2`: Pick up the blue ball.
9. `gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_4`: Go in front of the blue door in room_2 that connects to room_4.
10. `toggle blue_door_1`: Unlock the blue door.
11. `gotoroom room_2 room_4 blue_door_1`: Go from room_2 to room_4 through the blue door.
12. `gotoempty`: Go in front of an empty position in room_4.
13. `drop blue_ball_1 room_4`: Drop the blue ball.
14. `gotoobject purple_box_2 room_4`: Go in front of the purple box in room_4.

Actually, I realize that after dropping the blue ball, I need to be sure I'm not in front of the purple box already. If the action `gotoempty` can place me in front of any empty spot, then I might end up in front of the blue ball I just dropped, and I need to be in front of the purple box.

So let's make sure step 14 is necessary, and if it is, make sure that the blue ball and the purple box aren't occupying the same position.

Actually, the action `drop x r` results in me being in front of object x after dropping it. So, after dropping the blue ball, I'm still in front of it, not in front of the purple box. This means I do need the step of going in front of the purple box.

Let's adjust the plan slightly:

1. `gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1`: Go in front of the grey door in room_3 that connects to room_1.
2. `toggle grey_door_1`: Unlock the grey door.
3. `gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1`: Go from room_3 to room_1 through the grey door.
4. `gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2`: Go in front of the purple door in room_1 that connects to room_2.
5. `toggle purple_door_1`: Unlock the purple door.
6. `gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1`: Go from room_1 to room_2 through the purple door.
7. `gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_2`: Go in front of the blue ball in room_2.
8. `pick blue_ball_1 room_2`: Pick up the blue ball.
9. `gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_4`: Go in front of the blue door in room_2 that connects to room_4.
10. `toggle blue_door_1`: Unlock the blue door.
11. `gotoroom room_2 room_4 blue_door_1`: Go from room_2 to room_4 through the blue door.
12. `gotoempty`: Go in front of an empty position in room_4.
13. `drop blue_ball_1 room_4`: Drop the blue ball.
14. `gotoobject purple_box_2 room_4`: Go in front of the purple box in room_4.

Hmm, but after the `drop` action, according to its effects, I'm in front of the object I dropped. So I would be in front of blue_ball_1, not an empty position. Let me re-examine the action descriptions:

- `drop`: After performing this action regarding an object x, (i) you are no longer carrying x, (ii) you are in front of x, (iii) your hands are empty, and (iv) object x is situated in the room you are currently in.

So, after dropping the blue ball, I'm in front of it. This means I don't need step 12 (`gotoempty`) before dropping the ball. I can just drop the ball wherever I'm standing after entering room_4, and then I'll automatically be in front of the ball. Then, I need to move to the purple box.

Let's adjust the plan again:

1. `gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1`: Go in front of the grey door in room_3 that connects to room_1.
2. `toggle grey_door_1`: Unlock the grey door.
3. `gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1`: Go from room_3 to room_1 through the grey door.
4. `gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2`: Go in front of the purple door in room_1 that connects to room_2.
5. `toggle purple_door_1`: Unlock the purple door.
6. `gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1`: Go from room_1 to room_2 through the purple door.
7. `gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_2`: Go in front of the blue ball in room_2.
8. `pick blue_ball_1 room_2`: Pick up the blue ball.
9. `gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_4`: Go in front of the blue door in room_2 that connects to room_4.
10. `toggle blue_door_1`: Unlock the blue door.
11. `gotoroom room_2 room_4 blue_door_1`: Go from room_2 to room_4 through the blue door.
12. `drop blue_ball_1 room_4`: Drop the blue ball.
13. `gotoobject purple_box_2 room_4`: Go in front of the purple box in room_4.

Wait, I just realized that I may have misunderstood the `drop` action. The precondition says:

- `drop`: you may only drop an object x if (i) you are currently holding x, and (ii) the position in front of you is empty.

But that suggests I need to be in front of an empty space to drop something. So maybe I do need the `gotoempty` step.

Let me re-check the complete action description for `drop`:

Preconditions:
- I am currently holding the object.
- The position in front of me is empty.

Effects:
- I am no longer carrying the object.
- I am in front of the object.
- My hands are empty.
- The object is situated in the room I'm currently in.

So, I must be in front of an empty space to drop an object, and after dropping it, I'm in front of the object. So, I do need the `gotoempty` step before dropping the blue ball. Let's adjust the plan once more:

1. `gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1`: Go in front of the grey door in room_3 that connects to room_1.
2. `toggle grey_door_1`: Unlock the grey door.
3. `gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1`: Go from room_3 to room_1 through the grey door.
4. `gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2`: Go in front of the purple door in room_1 that connects to room_2.
5. `toggle purple_door_1`: Unlock the purple door.
6. `gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1`: Go from room_1 to room_2 through the purple door.
7. `gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_2`: Go in front of the blue ball in room_2.
8. `pick blue_ball_1 room_2`: Pick up the blue ball.
9. `gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_4`: Go in front of the blue door in room_2 that connects to room_4.
10. `toggle blue_door_1`: Unlock the blue door.
11. `gotoroom room_2 room_4 blue_door_1`: Go from room_2 to room_4 through the blue door.
12. `gotoempty`: Go in front of an empty position in room_4.
13. `drop blue_ball_1 room_4`: Drop the blue ball.
14. `gotoobject purple_box_2 room_4`: Go in front of the purple box in room_4.

Hmm, but I'm a bit confused now. After the `gotoroom` action, according to its effects, if I was in front of some object or door, then I'm no longer in front of it. So after going from room_2 to room_4, I'm not in front of blue_door_1 anymore. But it doesn't specify where I am in room_4. Am I in front of an empty position, or in front of an object?

Let me see if the `gotoroom` action's effects give any hints:

- `gotoroom`: After performing this action in order to go from room r1 to room r2, (i) you are no longer in r1, (ii) you are in r2, (iii) you have visited r2, (iv) if you were in front of some object or door x0, then you are no longer in front of x0.

It just says I'm not in front of anything I was previously in front of, but it doesn't specify where I am now. I'm guessing I need to explicitly go in front of an empty position in room_4 before I can drop the ball.

Maybe there's another approach to this problem. The goal is to be in room_4, in front of a purple box. But the constraint requires holding the blue ball at some point. Maybe I don't need to drop the ball at all?

In my planning, holding the blue ball and going to room_4 achieves the constraint, so after that, it seems I can just go in front of purple_box_2 while holding the blue ball, and that would satisfy both the goal and the constraint.

But the goal says "you are in front of a purple box" and I'm not sure if I can be in front of a purple box while holding a blue ball. The action's descriptions dont expicitly forbid it, though.

Actually, let's be cautious and ensure we're holding the blue ball at some point and drop it before going in front of the purple box. I'll stick with the full plan:

1. `gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1`: Go in front of the grey door in room_3 that connects to room_1.
2. `toggle grey_door_1`: Unlock the grey door.
3. `gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1`: Go from room_3 to room_1 through the grey door.
4. `gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2`: Go in front of the purple door in room_1 that connects to room_2.
5. `toggle purple_door_1`: Unlock the purple door.
6. `gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1`: Go from room_1 to room_2 through the purple door.
7. `gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_2`: Go in front of the blue ball in room_2.
8. `pick blue_ball_1 room_2`: Pick up the blue ball.
9. `gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_4`: Go in front of the blue door in room_2 that connects to room_4.
10. `toggle blue_door_1`: Unlock the blue door.
11. `gotoroom room_2 room_4 blue_door_1`: Go from room_2 to room_4 through the blue door.
12. `gotoempty`: Go in front of an empty position in room_4.
13. `drop blue_ball_1 room_4`: Drop the blue ball.
14. `gotoobject purple_box_2 room_4`: Go in front of the purple box in room_4.

I think this completes the plan. Let's trace through it once more to ensure everything is consistent.

I start in room_3. I go in front of grey_door_1, toggle it, and go to room_1. I then go in front of purple_door_1, toggle it, and go to room_2. In room_2, I go in front of blue_ball_1, pick it up, and then go in front of blue_door_1, toggle it, and go to room_4. In room_4, I go in front of an empty position, drop the blue ball, and then go in front of purple_box_2.

This plan satisfies the goal of being in room_4 in front of a purple box, and it also satisfies the constraint of holding the blue ball at some point.

I've ensured that all preconditions are met for each action, and the expected effects make the plan consistent. So, this is my final plan:

1. `gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1`
2. `toggle grey_door_1`
3. `gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1`
4. `gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2`
5. `toggle purple_door_1`
6. `gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1`
7. `gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_2`
8. `pick blue_ball_1 room_2`
9. `gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_4`
10. `toggle blue_door_1`
11. `gotoroom room_2 room_4 blue_door_1`
12. `gotoempty`
13. `drop blue_ball_1 room_4`
14. `gotoobject purple_box_2 room_4`

Let's review a little more: 

One issue is that I've been assuming there were no objects blocking the doors, since the problem statement didn't mention any. But that's a precondition for the `gotodoor` action, so I should be cautious about it. Let me make sure none of the boxes and balls are blocking the doors I need to use.

The objects in the initial state are:
- blue_box_1 is in room_1
- green_box_1, blue_ball_1, and purple_box_1 are in room_2
- green_box_2, grey_box_1, and grey_box_2 are in room_3
- purple_box_2 is in room_4

The problem statement doesn't specify if any of these are blocking doors. If one of the doors I need to use is blocked, I'd need to adjust the plan accordingly. But since it doesn't mention any blocking, I'll assume all doors are not blocked.

One more thing to review: I want to ensure I'm following the most optimal path to satisfy the goal and constraint. The goal is to be in room_4 in front of a purple box, and the constraint is to hold the blue ball at some point.

Since purple_box_2 is already in room_4, and I'm trying to be in room_4 in front of a purple box, I need to get to room_4 and go in front of purple_box_2. The blue ball is in room_2, so I need to visit room_2 at some point, pick up the blue ball, and then proceed to room_4.

The paths I could take are:
1. room_3 -> room_1 -> room_2 -> room_4 (the path I described in my plan)
2. room_3 -> room_4 -> room_2 -> room_4 (going to room_4 first, then to room_2 to get the ball, then back to room_4)

Path 2 requires me to go from room_3 to room_4 directly via yellow_door_1, but I didn't include this in my plan. Upon reflection, if all doors are initially locked, then I'd need to toggle the yellow door from room_3 and toggle the blue door from room_4 to go to room_2. Then I'd pick up the blue ball and go back through the blue door to room_4.

Let's check if path 2 is more efficient than path 1:

Path 1 requires:
- 13 actions: 3 "gotodoor", 3 "toggle", 3 "gotoroom", 1 "gotoobject", 1 "pick", 1 "gotoempty", 1 "drop" actions.

Path 2 would require:
- 13 actions: 3 "gotodoor", 3 "toggle", 3 "gotoroom", 1 "gotoobject", 1 "pick", 1 "gotoempty", 1 "drop" actions.

Both paths have the same number of actions with similar complexity, so there's no clear advantage to changing the path. I'll stick with path 1 for simplicity.

1. `gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1`
2. `toggle grey_door_1`
3. `gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1`
4. `gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2`
5. `toggle purple_door_1`
6. `gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1`
7. `gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_2`
8. `pick blue_ball_1 room_2`
9. `gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_4`
10. `toggle blue_door_1`
11. `gotoroom room_2 room_4 blue_door_1`
12. `gotoempty`
13. `drop blue_ball_1 room_4`
14. `gotoobject purple_box_2 room_4`

Ah, one more thing to double check: when I toggle a door from one room, like toggling grey_door_1 from room_3, does that also unlock it from the other side (room_1)? I think it does, because the door itself is unlocked, not just the access from a specific room. If not, the plan would need adjustments, but the problem description suggests that toggling a door changes its locked status, not the access from a particular room.

Let me consider a more direct path that might be more optimal. Could I go directly from room_3 to room_4 via yellow_door_1, then go back to room_2 via blue_door_1 to pick up the blue ball, and then return to room_4? This would mean:

1. `gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_4`
2. `toggle yellow_door_1`
3. `gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_1`
4. `gotodoor blue_door_1 room_4 room_2`
5. `toggle blue_door_1`
6. `gotoroom room_4 room_2 blue_door_1`
7. `gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_2`
8. `pick blue_ball_1 room_2`
9. `gotoroom room_2 room_4 blue_door_1`
10. `gotoempty`
11. `drop blue_ball_1 room_4`
12. `gotoobject purple_box_2 room_4`

Hmm, this path has only 12 actions compared to the 14 actions in the previous plan. But let me step through it to make sure it's valid:

1. `gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_4`: Go in front of the yellow door in room_3 that connects to room_4.
2. `toggle yellow_door_1`: Unlock the yellow door.
3. `gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_1`: Go from room_3 to room_4 through the yellow door.
4. `gotodoor blue_door_1 room_4 room_2`: Go in front of the blue door in room_4 that connects to room_2.
5. `toggle blue_door_1`: Unlock the blue door.
6. `gotoroom room_4 room_2 blue_door_1`: Go from room_4 to room_2 through the blue door.
7. `gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_2`: Go in front of the blue ball in room_2.
8. `pick blue_ball_1 room_2`: Pick up the blue ball.
9. `gotoroom room_2 room_4 blue_door_1`: Go from room_2 to room_4 through the blue door.
10. `gotoempty`: Go in front of an empty position in room_4.
11. `drop blue_ball_1 room_4`: Drop the blue ball.
12. `gotoobject purple_box_2 room_4`: Go in front of the purple box in room_4.

This plan seems valid. It gets me to room_4, fulfills the constraint of holding the blue ball at some point, and ends with me in front of a purple box (purple_box_2) in room_4.

As this has fewer steps than the previous plan, it's more optimal. So I'll use this as my final plan:

1. `gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_4`
2. `toggle yellow_door_1`
3. `gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_1`
4. `gotodoor blue_door_1 room_4 room_2`
5. `toggle blue_door_1`
6. `gotoroom room_4 room_2 blue_door_1`
7. `gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_2`
8. `pick blue_ball_1 room_2`
9. `gotoroom room_2 room_4 blue_door_1`
10. `gotoempty`
11. `drop blue_ball_1 room_4`
12. `gotoobject purple_box_2 room_4`

I'm confident this is the most optimal plan to satisfy the goal while meeting the constraint.
