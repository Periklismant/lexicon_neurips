Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. So, the goal is to get a purple box into room_4, be in room_4, and be in front of that box. Also, there's a constraint that at some point, I need to be holding the blue_ball_1 and holding some object. Wait, but blue_ball_1 is the only ball, so that part is covered if I pick it up. But the constraint says "at least one state" where I'm holding blue_ball_1 and holding some object. Wait, that's redundant because if I'm holding blue_ball_1, I'm already holding an object. Maybe it's a typo, but I'll make sure to pick up the blue ball at some point.

Let me start by understanding the initial state. The agent is in room_3. The purple boxes are in room_2 (purple_box_1) and room_4 (purple_box_2). The goal is to have a purple box in room_4 and be in front of it in room_4. So, maybe the existing purple_box_2 in room_4 is already there. Wait, the initial state says purple_box_2 is in room_4, and it's purple. So the goal is satisfied if I'm in room_4 and in front of purple_box_2. But the goal says "there is a box v such that..." So maybe purple_box_2 is already in room_4. So I just need to go to room_4 and be in front of it. But wait, the problem says "the task is to bring about the following situation", which includes that the agent is in room_4 and in front of a purple box there. So if purple_box_2 is already there, maybe I just need to navigate to room_4 and stand in front of it.

But how to get to room_4 from room_3? The doors connecting room_3 and room_4 is yellow_door_1, which is locked. So I need to unlock it. But to toggle a door, I need to be in front of it. So first, go to the yellow door in room_3, unlock it, then go through to room_4. But wait, the initial state says all doors are locked. So yellow_door_1 is locked. So steps would be:

1. From room_3, go to yellow_door_1 (which connects room_3 and room_4). But to go to the door, I need to be in the same room as the door. So I'm in room_3, so I can goto the door. But the precondition for gotodoor is that there's no object blocking the position in front of the door. Are there any objects blocking doors in room_3? The initial state lists objects in room_3 as green_box_2, grey_box_1, grey_box_2. Are any of these blocking the door? The problem mentions that objects can block doors. But the initial state doesn't explicitly say any objects are blocking doors. Wait, the effects of the pick action mention that if x was blocking some door, then it's no longer blocking. So perhaps in the initial state, objects are not blocking doors unless stated. So assuming that the doors are not blocked by objects, so the agent can go to the door.

So, step by step:

- In room_3. Need to go to yellow_door_1. So action: gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_4. Then toggle it to unlock. Then gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_1. Then in room_4, go to purple_box_2. But wait, the initial position of purple_box_2 is in room_4. So once in room_4, I can gotoobject purple_box_2 room_4. Then drop or something? Wait, no, the goal is to be in front of the box. So after entering room_4, just goto the box. Then the goal is achieved.

But wait, the constraints require that at some point, the agent is holding blue_ball_1 and holding some object. But blue_ball_1 is in room_2. So how to get there?

So the agent is in room_3. To get to room_2, the path would be room_3 -> room_1 via grey_door_1, then room_1 -> room_2 via purple_door_1. But both doors are locked. So need to unlock them. But the agent is in room_3. Let's see:

From room_3, the doors are grey_door_1 (connects to room_1) and yellow_door_1 (connects to room_4). So to get to room_2, maybe:

1. Unlock grey_door_1: gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1 (but grey_door_1 is connecting room_1 and room_3). So in room_3, can go to grey_door_1. Then toggle to unlock. Then go to room_1. Then from room_1, go to purple_door_1, unlock it (but purple_door_1 is locked initially). So in room_1, gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2. Then toggle it. Then goto room_2. Then in room_2, pick up blue_ball_1. Then perhaps carry it around, but eventually drop it somewhere. But the constraint is that at least once, the agent is holding blue_ball_1. So the plan must include picking up blue_ball_1.

But the goal requires being in room_4 in front of a purple box. So maybe the optimal path is to first go to room_2, pick up the blue_ball_1, then proceed to room_4. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the plan can be:

1. From room_3, unlock yellow_door_1, go to room_4, but then need to get to room_2 to pick up the ball. But room_4 is connected to room_2 via blue_door_1 and to room_3 via yellow_door_1. So from room_4, can go to room_2 via blue_door_1 (but blue_door_1 is locked). So need to unlock blue_door_1. But blue_door_1 is in room_2 and room_4. So to unlock it, the agent must be in front of it. So if the agent is in room_4, gotodoor blue_door_1 room_4 room_2. Then toggle to unlock. Then go to room_2. Then pick up blue_ball_1, then go back to room_4.

But this seems longer. Alternatively, maybe the agent can go from room_3 to room_1 via grey_door_1, then to room_2 via purple_door_1, pick up the ball, then go to room_4 via blue_door_1 from room_2. Let's see.

Steps:

1. In room_3. Need to unlock grey_door_1. So:

Action: gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1
Action: toggle grey_door_1 (now unlocked)
Action: gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1 (now in room_1)
Now in room_1. Next, unlock purple_door_1 to get to room_2.

Action: gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2
Action: toggle purple_door_1 (unlock)
Action: gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1 (now in room_2)
In room_2. Now, pick up blue_ball_1.

Action: gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_2
Action: pick blue_ball_1 room_2 (now holding it)
Now, need to go to room_4. How? From room_2, the door to room_4 is blue_door_1, which is locked. So:

Action: gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_4
Action: toggle blue_door_1 (unlock)
Action: gotoroom room_2 room_4 blue_door_1 (now in room_4)
Now in room_4. Need to be in front of a purple box (purple_box_2 is already here). So:

Action: gotoobject purple_box_2 room_4

But wait, the goal requires that the agent is in room_4 and in front of a purple box there. So that's achieved. Also, the constraint requires that at some point the agent was holding blue_ball_1. Since we picked it up in room_2, that's satisfied. But then, after entering room_4, the agent is holding blue_ball_1. So to drop it, maybe? Because the drop action would require being in front of an empty position. But the goal doesn't say anything about dropping, just being in front of the box. However, after entering room_4, the agent is holding the ball and needs to goto the box. But to gotoobject, the agent must be in the same room as the object. Since the agent is in room_4, and the box is in room_4, that's okay. But when the agent does "gotoobject purple_box_2 room_4", the preconditions are that the agent is in the same room as the object, which they are. So even if holding the ball, it's allowed. So after that, the agent is in front of the box, in room_4, and the goal is achieved. The constraint is satisfied because the agent was holding the blue_ball_1 when moving from room_2 to room_4.

But wait, the plan would include:

1. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1
2. toggle grey_door_1
3. gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1
4. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2
5. toggle purple_door_1
6. gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1
7. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_2
8. pick blue_ball_1 room_2
9. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_4
10. toggle blue_door_1
11. gotoroom room_2 room_4 blue_door_1
12. gotoobject purple_box_2 room_4

This is 12 steps. But maybe there's a shorter path. Let's see another approach.

Alternative plan:

The agent starts in room_3. The yellow_door_1 connects room_3 and room_4. So unlock yellow_door_1 first.

1. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_4
2. toggle yellow_door_1 (unlock)
3. gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_1 (now in room_4)
But then the agent is in room_4. The purple_box_2 is there, so they can gotoobject. But then the constraint requires holding the blue_ball_1. So this approach skips that. Therefore, the agent must go to room_2 to pick up the ball.

So from room_4, to get to room_2, need to unlock blue_door_1. But blue_door_1 is locked. So:

In room_4:

4. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_4 room_2
5. toggle blue_door_1 (unlock)
6. gotoroom room_4 room_2 blue_door_1 (now in room_2)
7. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_2
8. pick blue_ball_1 room_2
Then, go back to room_4.

9. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_4
10. toggle blue_door_1 (lock again? No, because after toggle, it's unlocked. Wait, the initial state is locked. When you toggle, it unlocks. Then toggling again would lock. But in step 5, it's toggled to unlock. So step 10 would lock it again. Wait, but step 5 is toggle, which unlocks. Then step 10 is toggle again, which would lock. But we need the door to stay unlocked to go back. Wait, but after step 5, the door is unlocked. So when going from room_4 to room_2 (step 6), the door is unlocked. Then when returning from room_2 to room_4, the door is already unlocked. So step 9: gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_4. Then gotoroom room_2 room_4 blue_door_1. No need to toggle again. Wait, but the door was unlocked in step 5, so when in room_2, to go back to room_4, the door is already unlocked. So steps would be:

After step 8 (holding blue_ball_1 in room_2):

9. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_4
10. gotoroom room_2 room_4 blue_door_1 (now in room_4)
11. gotoobject purple_box_2 room_4

That's 11 steps. But the initial steps when unlocking yellow_door_1 would be 3 steps (goto, toggle, move). Then to get to room_2, unlock blue_door_1 (steps 4-6), then pick the ball, then return. Total steps: 3 (yellow) + 3 (blue) + 2 (pick) + 2 (return) = 10 steps. Wait, let me recount:

1. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_4
2. toggle yellow_door_1
3. gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_1 (in room_4)
4. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_4 room_2
5. toggle blue_door_1
6. gotoroom room_4 room_2 blue_door_1 (in room_2)
7. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_2
8. pick blue_ball_1 room_2
9. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_4
10. gotoroom room_2 room_4 blue_door_1 (in room_4)
11. gotoobject purple_box_2 room_4

That's 11 actions. But in the first approach, the steps were 12. So this seems shorter. But wait, is step 9 necessary? Because after step 6, the agent is in room_2. To go back to room_4 via blue_door_1, the door is already unlocked (toggled in step 5). So step 9: gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_4 (precondition: in room_2, door connects to room_4, and no object blocking. Then step 10: gotoroom to room_4. So steps 9 and 10 are needed. So total 11 steps.

But the first approach (going via room_1 and room_2) was 12 steps. So this is better. But the problem says to provide an optimal plan, the shortest possible. So which is shorter? Let's compare the two paths.

Alternative path 1 (via room_1 and room_2):

12 steps.

Alternative path 2 (via room_4 first, then room_2):

11 steps.

But the second path requires the agent to first go to room_4, then to room_2, then back to room_4. So that's possible.

But wait, when the agent is in room_3, they can go to room_4 via yellow_door_1 (unlocking it), then go to room_4, then unlock blue_door_1 from room_4's side. Then go to room_2, pick the ball, then return to room_4. So total steps:

1. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room3 room4
2. toggle (unlocks)
3. gotoroom to room4
4. gotodoor blue_door_1 room4 room2
5. toggle (unlocks)
6. gotoroom room4 to room2
7. gotoobject blue_ball_1
8. pick
9. gotodoor blue_door_1 room2 room4
10. gotoroom to room4
11. gotoobject purple_box_2

Total 11 steps. But the constraint is that at some point, the agent is holding blue_ball_1 and holding some object. Since step 8 is pick, after that, the agent is holding it. So that's satisfied.

But maybe there's an even shorter path. Let's see: Can the agent go from room_3 to room_1, then to room_2, pick the ball, then go to room_4 via blue_door_1. Let's count steps:

1. gotodoor grey_door_1 room3 room1
2. toggle
3. gotoroom to room1
4. gotodoor purple_door_1 room1 room2
5. toggle
6. gotoroom to room2
7. gotoobject blue_ball_1
8. pick
9. gotodoor blue_door_1 room2 room4
10. toggle
11. gotoroom to room4
12. gotoobject purple_box_2

That's 12 steps. So longer than the second approach.

But maybe there's a way to not have to unlock both blue and yellow doors. Wait, the goal is to be in room_4. So if the agent can get to room_4 via yellow door (unlocking it once), then no need to go through room_2. But they need to pick up the blue_ball_1 in room_2. So unless there's a way to get the ball to room_4 without going through room_2, which there isn't. The ball is in room_2 initially.

So the second approach seems shorter.

But wait, when the agent is in room_4 after step 3, they need to unlock blue_door_1 (step 4-5). Then go to room_2 (step 6). Pick the ball (7-8). Then go back to room_4 (9-10). Then gotoobject (11). So 11 steps.

Another possibility: After unlocking blue_door_1 in room_4, can the agent pick the ball and bring it back, but the goal requires the box to be in room_4, which it already is. So maybe the agent doesn't need to carry the ball to room_4, but just needs to pick it up once. So after step 8 (picking the ball), could they drop it immediately, then proceed. But the constraint requires that they are holding it at some point. So as long as step 8 is in the plan, the constraint is satisfied, regardless of whether they drop it later.

But in the current plan, after step 8, the agent is holding the ball. Then they go back to room_4, and then goto the box. The problem is that when you drop an object, you need to be in front of an empty position. But the plan doesn't require dropping the ball. So the agent can stay holding the ball when they goto the box. The preconditions for gotoobject are that you are in the same room as the object. Holding an object doesn't prevent that. So the final state would have the agent in room_4, in front of purple_box_2, holding blue_ball_1. The goal doesn't require not holding anything, just the presence of the box in room_4 and the agent's position. So that's acceptable. So the plan is valid.

But the problem is that the agent must drop the ball before doing other actions? No, the only actions after picking the ball are moving. So the plan is:

1. goto yellow door in room3
2. toggle
3. go to room4
4. goto blue door in room4
5. toggle
6. go to room2
7. goto blue_ball_1
8. pick
9. goto blue door in room2
10. go to room4
11. goto purple_box_2 in room4

That's 11 steps, which satisfies all conditions. The constraint is met at step 8 (holding the ball). The goal is achieved at step 11.

But wait, when the agent is in room_4 after step 10, they are holding the ball. Then they perform gotoobject purple_box_2. The preconditions for gotoobject are that they are in the same room as the object. That's true. So the action is allowed. After that, they are in front of the purple box in room_4, which is the goal. So the plan works.

This seems optimal. Are there any steps that can be combined or removed?

Let me check if any actions can be skipped. For example, after step 5 (unlocking blue_door_1 from room4), when going to room2, the door is unlocked, so steps 4-6 are necessary. Then steps 7-8 to pick the ball. Then steps 9-10 to return. So it's necessary.

Yes, this seems like the shortest path. So the answer is the 11-step plan.
