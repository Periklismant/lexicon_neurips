Okay, let's see. The goal is to have a purple box in room_4, be in room_4, and be in front of that box. The initial state is that I'm in room_3. All doors are locked, so I need to unlock them. Let's look at the objects. There's a purple_box_1 in room_2 and purple_box_2 in room_4. So if I can get to room_4, maybe I can just be in front of purple_box_2. But first, how do I get to room_4 from room_3?

The doors between rooms: room_3 and room_4 are connected via yellow_door_1, which is yellow and locked. To unlock it, I need to toggle it, which requires being in front of it. But to get in front of the door, I need to check if there's any object blocking it. Let's see what's in room_3. In room_3, there's green_box_2, grey_box_1, grey_box_2. Are any of these blocking the door? The problem states that objects can block doors if they are in front of them. So if any of these boxes are in front of the yellow door in room_3, I can't go there unless I move them. Wait, but the initial state doesn't mention any objects blocking doors. Hmm, maybe the doors aren't blocked initially. So maybe I can go to the yellow door in room_3.

Wait, the "goto door" action's precondition is that there's no object blocking the position in front of the door in the current room. So I need to check if any objects are blocking yellow_door_1 in room_3. Since the initial state doesn't mention any such blockages, perhaps it's safe to assume they're not blocked. So step 1: goto the yellow door in room_3. Then toggle it to unlock. Then go through the door to room_4. Once in room_4, I need to be in front of a purple box. Since purple_box_2 is already in room_4, I can just go to it. But wait, the goal is to be in front of a purple box in room_4 and be in room_4. So maybe the plan is:

1. Go to yellow_door_1 in room_3 (gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_4)
2. Toggle it to unlock.
3. Go through the door to room_4 (gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_1)
4. Then go to purple_box_2 in room_4 (gotoobject purple_box_2 room_4)

But wait, all doors start locked. So yes, need to toggle the yellow door first. Let's check each action's preconditions.

Starting in room_3. To goto the yellow door in room_3, use gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_4. Preconditions: I'm in a room that door d connects (room_3 is connected to room_4 via yellow_door_1), and no object is blocking the position in front of d in room_3. Since initial state doesn't mention any objects blocking doors, maybe that's okay. Then toggle the door. Then goto room_4. Once in room_4, I can gotoobject purple_box_2 room_4.

But wait, the goal says "you are in room_4" and "in front of v" where v is a purple box in room_4. So this plan should work. But let me check if there's a shorter path. For example, is there a way to get to room_4 via other doors? The other doors from room_3 are grey_door_1 connecting to room_1. But room_1 has blue_box_1. From room_1, the purple_door_1 connects to room_2. Room_2 connects to room_4 via blue_door_1, which is blue and locked. So that path would require unlocking multiple doors. The direct path via yellow_door_1 seems better.

So the steps:

gotoempty (to leave any current position, but maybe not necessary if we start not in front of anything). Wait, the initial state says "you are in room_3" but doesn't mention being in front of any object. So maybe the agent is not in front of anything. So first action could be gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_4. Then toggle, then gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_1. Then in room_4, gotoobject purple_box_2 room_4. That's four actions. But wait, the problem requires that the plan is optimal, so no unnecessary steps.

Alternatively, maybe there's a need to pick up a box to unlock a door. Wait, no. The toggle action only requires being in front of the door. So as long as the door is reachable, toggle can be done. Let's confirm the initial positions. The agent is in room_3. To reach yellow_door_1, they can perform gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_4. Then toggle, then go through. Then in room_4, goto the purple box. So that's four steps. Is that possible?

Yes. Let's write the steps:

1. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_4
2. toggle yellow_door_1
3. gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_1
4. gotoobject purple_box_2 room_4

But let's check if each action is possible.

1. gotodoor: agent is in room_3, which is connected via yellow_door_1 to room_4. Precondition met. No object blocking the door's position in room_3. Assuming that's true, action is allowed.

2. toggle: agent is in front of yellow_door_1. So toggle is allowed. This unlocks the door.

3. gotoroom: from room_3 to room_4 via yellow_door_1. Door is now unlocked, so allowed. Agent moves to room_4.

4. In room_4, gotoobject purple_box_2. Since the agent is in room_4, which is where the box is, this action is allowed.

So this plan should work. But wait, in the initial state, purple_box_2 is in room_4. So the goal is to have a purple box in room_4, which it already is, and the agent in room_4 in front of it. So this plan satisfies the goal. However, the constraints may affect this. Wait, the user mentioned constraints but didn't list any. Wait, looking back at the problem statement: "A valid plan for the abovementioned problem must abide by the following constraints:" but then there's nothing. Maybe a formatting error. Wait, the original problem description includes constraints? Let me check again.

The user wrote: "A valid plan for the abovementioned problem must abide by the following constraints:" but after that, there's no listed constraints. Hmm, maybe that's a mistake. But assuming there are no additional constraints beyond the action preconditions, the plan above should work.

Alternatively, maybe the initial problem had constraints that were omitted here. But according to the given data, there are no constraints listed. So the plan I outlined should be valid.

Another thing to check: when the agent moves from room_3 to room_4, they are no longer in front of the door. Then in room_4, when they perform gotoobject, they need to be in the same room as the object, which they are.

Yes, this seems correct. So the optimal plan is four steps.
