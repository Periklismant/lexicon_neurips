Okay, let's tackle this planning problem step by step. The goal is to get to a green door that connects room_1 and room_2, be in front of it, have it unlocked, and all while never entering room_2. Also, all doors start locked. Hmm.

First, the initial state: I'm in room_4. The green door connecting room_1 and room_2 is green_door_1. But that door is locked. To unlock it, I need to toggle it, which requires being in front of it. But to get there, I need to navigate through the rooms without entering room_2.

Looking at the connections: room_4 is connected to room_3 via yellow_door_1 and to room_2 via red_door_1. But room_2 is off-limits. So the only path is through room_3 to room_1, then to the green door. Let me check the connections:

From room_4, I can go to room_3 via yellow_door_1. But yellow_door_1 is locked. So I need to unlock it. To do that, I have to be in front of it. So first, I need to go to yellow_door_1 in room_4, toggle it to unlock. Then go through it to room_3. Once in room_3, the grey_door_1 connects to room_1. But grey_door_1 is locked. So I need to unlock that as well. But how?

Wait, the grey_door_1 connects room_3 and room_1. So I need to go to grey_door_1 in room_3, toggle it to unlock. But to get in front of it, I need to check if there's any object blocking it. The initial state says that in room_3, there are purple_box_1, yellow_ball_1, blue_box_1, blue_ball_2. Are any of these blocking the door? The problem states that objects can block the position in front of a door. Wait, the "goto door" action has a precondition that there's no object blocking the position in front of d in the current room. So if any object is in front of the door, I can't go there. But how do I know if objects are blocking? The initial state doesn't mention any objects blocking doors. Wait, maybe the problem assumes that unless specified, doors aren't blocked. But perhaps some objects are in front of doors. Wait, the original state doesn't mention any objects being in front of doors. So maybe the doors aren't blocked. So I can proceed.

So steps:

1. From room_4, go to yellow_door_1 (since I'm in room_4, which is connected to room_3 via yellow_door_1). The action would be gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_3. But before that, I need to go in front of the door. Wait, the "gotodoor d r1 r2" action requires that I'm in a room connected by d (which room_4 is, since yellow_door_1 connects room_4 and room_3). So first, perform gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_3. Then toggle it to unlock. Then gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_1. Now in room_3.

Next, in room_3, I need to get to grey_door_1 which connects to room_1. So gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1. Then toggle it to unlock. Then go through grey_door_1 to room_1. Once in room_1, the green_door_1 connects room_1 and room_2. But I can't enter room_2. But I need to be in front of green_door_1, which is in room_1. So gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_2. Then toggle it to unlock. Then the goal is achieved: I'm in front of a green door (green_door_1) that connects room_1 and room_2, and it's unlocked. Also, I never entered room_2.

But wait, let's verify the constraints. The constraint is that in every state, I'm not in room_2. So all my actions must not involve moving into room_2. The path I outlined doesn't go to room_2, so that's good.

Now, let's outline the steps with actions:

1. In room_4. Need to go to yellow_door_1.

Action: gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_3. Precondition: I'm in room_4, which is connected via yellow_door_1. Also, no object is blocking the door's front in room_4. Since the initial state doesn't mention any objects in front of doors, this should be possible.

Then toggle the door:

Action: toggle yellow_door_1. Precondition: I'm in front of it. After toggling, it's unlocked.

Then go to room_3:

Action: gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_1. Now in room_3.

Next, go to grey_door_1 in room_3:

Action: gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1. Precondition: I'm in room_3, which is connected via grey_door_1. No blocking objects.

Toggle grey_door_1 to unlock:

Action: toggle grey_door_1.

Then go to room_1:

Action: gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1. Now in room_1.

Now, need to go to green_door_1 in room_1:

Action: gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_2. Precondition: I'm in room_1, connected via green_door_1. No blocking objects.

Toggle green_door_1 (it was locked, now unlock it):

Action: toggle green_door_1. Now it's unlocked.

Now, the goal is to have a door d (green_door_1) that is green, connects room_1 and room_2, I'm in front of it, and it's not locked. All conditions are met. Also, I never entered room_2.

So the plan should be:

1. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_3
2. toggle yellow_door_1
3. gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_1
4. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1
5. toggle grey_door_1
6. gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1
7. gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_2
8. toggle green_door_1

Let me check each step for preconditions:

Step 1: gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_3. I'm in room_4, which is connected via yellow_door_1. No objects blocking, so possible.

Step 2: toggle yellow_door_1. I'm in front of it, so possible. Now yellow_door_1 is unlocked.

Step 3: gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_1. Door is unlocked, so possible. Now in room_3.

Step4: gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1. In room_3, connected via grey_door_1. No blocking objects.

Step5: toggle grey_door_1. Now unlocked.

Step6: gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1. Now in room_1.

Step7: gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_2. In room_1, connected via green_door_1. No blocking.

Step8: toggle green_door_1. Unlocks it.

This should satisfy the goal. The constraint of never being in room_2 is maintained throughout. The final state has me in front of green_door_1 in room_1, which is unlocked. The door is green, connects room_1 and room_2. All conditions met. The plan has 8 steps. Is there a shorter way?

Alternative approach: Is there a way to reach room_1 without going through room_3? Let's see. From room_4, can I go to room_2? But room_4 is connected to room_2 via red_door_1. But room_2 is forbidden. Also, red_door_1 is locked. So even if I tried to go that way, I'd have to unlock red_door_1, but entering room_2 is not allowed. So the only path is via room_3 to room_1.

Another check: Are there any objects that could be used to block doors, but that's not part of the problem. The constraints are only about not being in room_2.

So the plan outlined seems valid and optimal. The steps are necessary to unlock the doors in sequence to reach room_1 and then the green door.
