Let me break down the planning problem:

Initial State:
- I am in room_4
- There are boxes and balls in various rooms.
- There are 4 doors connecting the rooms, and they are all locked (green_door_1, grey_door_1, red_door_1, yellow_door_1).
- green_door_1 connects room_1 and room_2
- grey_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3
- red_door_1 connects room_2 and room_4
- yellow_door_1 connects room_3 and room_4

Goal State:
- I need to be in front of green_door_1 (the green door that connects room_1 and room_2)
- green_door_1 must be unlocked

Constraints:
- I cannot be in room_2 at any state during the plan execution.

Let's think about how to achieve this:

1. Currently, I'm in room_4.
2. I need to get to room_1 to stand in front of green_door_1.
3. I cannot go through room_2 because of the constraint.
4. So I need to go from room_4 to room_3 (via yellow_door_1) and then from room_3 to room_1 (via grey_door_1).
5. Before moving between rooms, I need to unlock the respective doors.

Let's draft a plan:

1. Go to yellow_door_1 in room_4 (connecting room_4 and room_3)
2. Toggle (unlock) yellow_door_1
3. Go to room_3 via yellow_door_1
4. Go to grey_door_1 in room_3 (connecting room_3 and room_1)
5. Toggle (unlock) grey_door_1
6. Go to room_1 via grey_door_1
7. Go to green_door_1 in room_1 (connecting room_1 and room_2)
8. Toggle (unlock) green_door_1

Let's validate against the constraints:
- At no point in this plan do I enter room_2, which satisfies the constraint.

Now, let's refine the action sequence based on the available actions:

1. "gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_3" (Go in front of yellow_door_1 connecting room_4 and room_3)
2. "toggle yellow_door_1" (Unlock yellow_door_1)
3. "gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_1" (Go to room_3 from room_4 using yellow_door_1)
4. "gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1" (Go in front of grey_door_1 connecting room_3 and room_1)
5. "toggle grey_door_1" (Unlock grey_door_1)
6. "gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1" (Go to room_1 from room_3 using grey_door_1)
7. "gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_2" (Go in front of green_door_1 connecting room_1 and room_2)
8. "toggle green_door_1" (Unlock green_door_1)

Let's double-check the plan:

Starting State: I am in room_4, and all doors are locked.

Action 1: "gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_3"
This action's preconditions are met: I'm in room_4, and yellow_door_1 connects room_4 to room_3.
After this action, I'm in front of yellow_door_1.

Action 2: "toggle yellow_door_1"
Precondition: I am in front of yellow_door_1. This is met.
After this action, yellow_door_1 is unlocked.

Action 3: "gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_1"
Preconditions: I'm in room_4, yellow_door_1 connects room_4 and room_3, and the door is unlocked. These are all met.
After this action, I'm in room_3 and no longer in front of yellow_door_1.

Action 4: "gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1"
Preconditions: I'm in room_3, and grey_door_1 connects room_3 to room_1. These are met.
After this action, I'm in front of grey_door_1.

Action 5: "toggle grey_door_1"
Precondition: I am in front of grey_door_1. This is met.
After this action, grey_door_1 is unlocked.

Action 6: "gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1"
Preconditions: I'm in room_3, grey_door_1 connects room_3 and room_1, and the door is unlocked. These are all met.
After this action, I'm in room_1 and no longer in front of grey_door_1.

Action 7: "gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_2"
Preconditions: I'm in room_1, and green_door_1 connects room_1 to room_2. These are met.
After this action, I'm in front of green_door_1.

Action 8: "toggle green_door_1"
Precondition: I am in front of green_door_1. This is met.
After this action, green_door_1 is unlocked.

Final State: I am in room_1, in front of green_door_1, and green_door_1 is unlocked.

This matches the goal state:
- I am in front of green_door_1.
- green_door_1 is not locked.
- green_door_1 is green.
- room_1 and room_2 are connected via green_door_1.

The constraint is satisfied because I never enter room_2 throughout the plan.

However, I need to check the actions here again, especially the "gotodoor" action, since the formal requirements for the action are a bit particular.  The action is written as:

"gotodoor d r1 r2": Go in front of door d, connecting room r1 to room r2.

The preconditions for this action are:
- I may only go in front of a door d if (i) I am in a room which door d is connecting with another room, and (ii) there is no object blocking the position in front of d in the room I am currently in.

That means that when I use "gotodoor", I need to specify the door, and the two rooms it connects, not just the room I am in. I need to revise the actions:

1. "gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_3" (Go in front of yellow_door_1, which connects room_4 and room_3)
2. "toggle yellow_door_1" (Unlock yellow_door_1)
3. "gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_1" (Go to room_3 from room_4 using yellow_door_1)
4. "gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1" (Go in front of grey_door_1, which connects room_3 and room_1)
5. "toggle grey_door_1" (Unlock grey_door_1)
6. "gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1" (Go to room_1 from room_3 using grey_door_1)
7. "gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_2" (Go in front of green_door_1, which connects room_1 and room_2)
8. "toggle green_door_1" (Unlock green_door_1)

Actually, I think my original plan was correct.  Let me check each action more closely against the formal definition:

"gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_3": This action means I go in front of yellow_door_1, which connects room_4 and room_3. The preconditions are that I am in one of rooms room_4 or room_3, and there is no object blocking the position in front of yellow_door_1 in the room I am currently in. Since I am in room_4 and there is no mention of any object blocking yellow_door_1, this action is valid.

"toggle yellow_door_1": This action means I change the state of yellow_door_1 from locked to unlocked. The precondition is that I am in front of yellow_door_1, which is true after the previous action, so this action is valid.

"gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_1": This action means I go from room_4 to room_3 using yellow_door_1. The preconditions are that I am in room_4, yellow_door_1 connects room_4 and room_3, and yellow_door_1 is unlocked. All of these are true after the previous actions, so this action is valid.

"gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1": This action means I go in front of grey_door_1, which connects room_3 and room_1. The preconditions are that I am in one of rooms room_3 or room_1, and there is no object blocking the position in front of grey_door_1 in the room I am currently in. Since I am in room_3 after the previous action and there is no mention of any object blocking grey_door_1, this action is valid.

"toggle grey_door_1": This action means I change the state of grey_door_1 from locked to unlocked. The precondition is that I am in front of grey_door_1, which is true after the previous action, so this action is valid.

"gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1": This action means I go from room_3 to room_1 using grey_door_1. The preconditions are that I am in room_3, grey_door_1 connects room_3 and room_1, and grey_door_1 is unlocked. All of these are true after the previous actions, so this action is valid.

"gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_2": This action means I go in front of green_door_1, which connects room_1 and room_2. The preconditions are that I am in one of rooms room_1 or room_2, and there is no object blocking the position in front of green_door_1 in the room I am currently in. Since I am in room_1 after the previous action and there is no mention of any object blocking green_door_1, this action is valid.

"toggle green_door_1": This action means I change the state of green_door_1 from locked to unlocked. The precondition is that I am in front of green_door_1, which is true after the previous action, so this action is valid.

So, all the actions in my plan are valid according to the problem's constraints. Now I'll double-check that the final state meets the goal.

Goal: "There is a door d such that "The following conditions are all true: "d is green", "room_1 and room_2 are connected via d", "you are in front of d", "d is not locked"""

Final state:
- I am in room_1, in front of green_door_1 (a green door that connects room_1 and room_2)
- green_door_1 is unlocked

This satisfies the goal. 

Here's the final plan:

1. "gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_3"
2. "toggle yellow_door_1"
3. "gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_1"
4. "gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1"
5. "toggle grey_door_1"
6. "gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1"
7. "gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_2"
8. "toggle green_door_1"

This sequence of actions achieves the goal and respects the constraints.

Actually, let me one final check. I need to make sure there are no objects blocking access to the doors, as that would violate the preconditions for the "gotodoor" action.

In the initial state, we are told:
- "green_box_1 is in room_2"
- "blue_ball_1 is in room_2"
- "purple_box_1 is in room_3"
- "yellow_ball_1 is in room_3"
- "blue_box_1 is in room_3"
- "blue_ball_2 is in room_3"
- "red_box_1 is in room_4"
- "green_box_2 is in room_4"

However, there is no information about which object, if any, is blocking any door. Since the problem statement doesn't specify that any door is blocked, I'll assume all doors are accessible.

One more check: we know "you have visited room_4", which means I've already visited room_4 in the initial state. This doesn't affect the plan's validity.

So the final plan is:

1. "gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_3"
2. "toggle yellow_door_1"
3. "gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_1"
4. "gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1"
5. "toggle grey_door_1"
6. "gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1"
7. "gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_2"
8. "toggle green_door_1"

Let me check one more time if there's a shorter or more optimal plan possible.

Actually, I wonder if it's possible to bypass some steps. For example, if I could go directly from room_4 to room_1, I could skip toggling yellow_door_1 and grey_door_1. But according to the problem, the only direct connections are:
- room_1 and room_2 via green_door_1
- room_1 and room_3 via grey_door_1
- room_2 and room_4 via red_door_1
- room_3 and room_4 via yellow_door_1

So, there is no direct path from room_4 to room_1. I need to go through either room_2 or room_3. But the constraint says I can't enter room_2, so I must go through room_3, which is exactly what my plan does.

I don't think there's a shorter valid plan, so let's stick with the 8-step plan.

Let's ensure we're using the exact action nomenclature from the problem:

1. "gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_3" (Go in front of yellow_door_1, which connects room_4 and room_3)
2. "toggle yellow_door_1" (Unlock yellow_door_1)
3. "gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_1" (Go to room_3 from room_4 using yellow_door_1)
4. "gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1" (Go in front of grey_door_1, which connects room_3 and room_1)
5. "toggle grey_door_1" (Unlock grey_door_1)
6. "gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1" (Go to room_1 from room_3 using grey_door_1)
7. "gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_2" (Go in front of green_door_1, which connects room_1 and room_2)
8. "toggle green_door_1" (Unlock green_door_1)

Alright, the plan seems to be valid and optimal, meaning it's the shortest valid plan for the given problem. This plan achieves the goal of being in front of an unlocked green_door_1 in room_1, and it respects the constraint of never entering room_2.

Actually, let me check one more time that the "gotodoor" is used properly. The description says:

"gotodoor d r1 r2": Go in front of door d, connecting room r1 to room r2.

I wonder if I should revise to use the same ordering as in the problem's constraints:

From the problem:
- "room_4 and room_3 are connected via yellow_door_1"
- "room_3 and room_1 are connected via grey_door_1"
- "room_1 and room_2 are connected via green_door_1"

So, maybe I should adjust it:

1. "gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_3" (Go in front of yellow_door_1 connecting room_4 and room_3)
2. "toggle yellow_door_1"
3. "gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_1"
4. "gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1" (Go in front of grey_door_1 connecting room_3 and room_1)
5. "toggle grey_door_1"
6. "gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1"
7. "gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_2" (Go in front of green_door_1 connecting room_1 and room_2)
8. "toggle green_door_1"

Ah, I see that it doesn't change the step. The order of rooms in "gotodoor d r1 r2" matches the problem's description. So my current plan is fine.

Let me ensure I have the correct number of steps in the plan:

1. "gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_3"
2. "toggle yellow_door_1"
3. "gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_1"
4. "gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1"
5. "toggle grey_door_1"
6. "gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1"
7. "gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_2"
8. "toggle green_door_1"

So the final plan is:

```
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_3
toggle yellow_door_1
gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_1
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1
toggle grey_door_1
gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1
gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_2
toggle green_door_1
```

That's my plan in the required format.
