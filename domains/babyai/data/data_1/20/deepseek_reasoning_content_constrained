Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. So, the goal is to get a purple ball into room_3, be in room_3, and be in front of it. Also, there's a constraint that at some point, grey_ball_2 is in room_1. Let me start by understanding the initial state and the available actions.

First, the initial state: the agent is in room_2. The purple_ball_1 is in room_3 already. Wait, the goal is to have a purple ball in room_3. So maybe we can just use that one? Because the goal says "there exists a ball v" such that those conditions. So if purple_ball_1 is already in room_3, then maybe we just need to get to room_3 and be in front of it. But the agent starts in room_2. So the steps would involve moving from room_2 to room_3. But the doors are all locked initially. Let me check the doors:

The doors are grey_door_1 (grey, connects room_1 and 2), blue_door_1 (blue, connects room_1 and 3), purple_door_1 (purple, connects 2 and 4), blue_door_2 (blue, connects 3 and 4). All doors are locked. So to move through any door, we need to unlock it first. But to toggle a door, you need to be in front of it. So the agent has to go to the door, toggle it (unlock), then go through.

But the agent is in room_2. Let's see possible paths to room_3. From room_2, the connected rooms are 1 (via grey_door_1) and 4 (via purple_door_1). To get to room_3, maybe through room_1. So room_2 → room_1 via grey_door_1, then room_1 → room_3 via blue_door_1. Alternatively, room_2 → room_4 via purple_door_1, then room_4 → room_3 via blue_door_2. Which path is shorter? Let's see.

But all doors are locked. So for any path, the agent needs to unlock the doors. Let's plan the path step by step.

Starting in room_2. To unlock grey_door_1 (connects 1 and 2), since the agent is in room_2, they can go to the door (grey_door_1) in room_2. But wait, the "goto door" action requires being in a room that the door connects. So for grey_door_1, which connects room_1 and 2. So in room_2, the agent can go to grey_door_1. But is there any object blocking the position in front of the door? The initial state doesn't mention any objects blocking doors. Wait, the preconditions for "goto door" say that there is no object blocking the position in front of d in the current room. So we need to check if any object is blocking that door.

Looking at initial objects in room_2: purple_box_2 is there. Where are the objects placed? The problem says the initial state includes that the agent is in room_2. The objects in room_1 are grey_ball_1, purple_box_1, red_ball_1. In room_2, purple_box_2. In room_3, purple_ball_1. In room_4: red_box_1, grey_ball_2, yellow_box_1. So in room_2, the only object is purple_box_2. If the purple_box_2 is blocking the door, then the agent can't go to the door. But the problem doesn't mention any door being blocked. So perhaps none of the doors are blocked by objects initially. So the agent can go to the door.

So starting in room_2:

1. Go to the grey_door_1 in room_2. Action: gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_1. Then toggle it (unlock). Then go through the door to room_1. But wait, the goto door action requires being in front of the door. So after gotodoor, then toggle, then gotoroom room_2 room_1 grey_door_1.

Wait, the gotoroom action is "gotoroom r1 r2 d": go from r1 to r2 using door d. So after unlocking the door, the agent can use it.

But the initial plan would be:

- gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_1 (since agent is in room_2, which is connected via grey_door_1 to room_1). Then toggle grey_door_1 (unlocks it). Then gotoroom room_2 room_1 grey_door_1. Now agent is in room_1.

Then, in room_1, the blue_door_1 connects to room_3. But blue_door_1 is locked. So need to unlock it. So:

- gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_3. Then toggle blue_door_1 (unlock). Then gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_1. Now in room_3. Then, the purple_ball_1 is in room_3. So then gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_3. Then the agent is in front of it, in room_3. So the goal is achieved.

But wait, the goal requires the agent to be in room_3, in front of a purple ball (which is already there), so that sequence would work. But the constraints require that at least once, grey_ball_2 is in room_1. But in the initial state, grey_ball_2 is in room_4. So how can we get grey_ball_2 into room_1? The agent needs to move it there. Since grey_ball_2 is in room_4, the agent would have to go to room_4, pick it up, and bring it to room_1.

So the problem is that the plan I outlined above doesn't involve grey_ball_2 at all, so the constraint isn't met. Therefore, the agent must somehow move grey_ball_2 to room_1 during the plan.

So the plan needs to include moving grey_ball_2 from room_4 to room_1. Let's think about how to do that.

Grey_ball_2 is in room_4. The agent starts in room_2. So to get to room_4, the agent can go via purple_door_1 (connects room_2 and 4). But that door is locked. So the agent would have to go to room_2's purple_door_1, unlock it, then go to room_4. Then pick up grey_ball_2, bring it back to room_2, then to room_1 via grey_door_1 (already unlocked?), or through another path. Wait, but after moving through rooms, the agent may need to unlock other doors.

Alternatively, perhaps the agent can take a path like room_2 → room_4 (unlock purple_door_1), pick up grey_ball_2, then take it through room_4 to room_3 via blue_door_2 (unlock that), then go to room_3, then to room_1 via blue_door_1 (unlock that), then drop it in room_1. But that seems longer. Let's think step by step.

But let's see the minimal steps. Let's outline two possible paths:

Option 1: Achieve the goal directly by going to room_3 through room_1, but also handle moving grey_ball_2 to room_1.

Option 2: Take a different path that involves moving grey_ball_2.

But since the constraint is that "grey_ball_2 is in room_1" must hold at least once, the agent must move it there. So the plan must include moving grey_ball_2 to room_1.

So steps required:

1. Go to room_4 (from room_2) via purple_door_1. But first, unlock purple_door_1.

   - gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_4 (agent is in room_2)
   - toggle purple_door_1 (unlock)
   - gotoroom room_2 room_4 purple_door_1 (now in room_4)
   - gotoobject grey_ball_2 room_4
   - pick grey_ball_2 room_4
   - Now need to take it to room_1.

To get to room_1 from room_4: possible paths are via room_2 (room_4 → room_2 via purple_door_1, then room_2 → room_1 via grey_door_1). But grey_door_1 was initially locked. Wait, in the initial state, the agent is in room_2 and grey_door_1 is locked. If the agent previously unlocks grey_door_1 to go to room_1, but in this scenario, perhaps the agent hasn't done that yet. So the agent would need to unlock both purple_door_1 and grey_door_1.

But in this scenario, the agent is in room_4, holding grey_ball_2, and needs to get to room_1. Path options:

Option A: room_4 → room_2 via purple_door_1 (already unlocked), then room_2 → room_1 via grey_door_1 (need to unlock it).

But to unlock grey_door_1, the agent must be in front of it in room_2. So:

- gotoroom room_4 room_2 purple_door_1 (already in room_4, so move to room_2)
- gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_1
- toggle grey_door_1 (unlock)
- gotoroom room_2 room_1 grey_door_1 (now in room_1)
- drop grey_ball_2 room_1

Then proceed to room_3 via blue_door_1 (unlock it).

But this seems like a lot of steps. Let's count:

From room_4:

1. goto room_2 via purple_door_1 (gotoroom room_4 room_2 purple_door_1)
2. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_1
3. toggle grey_door_1
4. gotoroom room_2 room_1 grey_door_1
5. drop grey_ball_2 room_1 (but need to be in front of empty spot. So after entering room_1, the agent is in room_1 but not in front of any object. So perhaps after arriving, they need to gotoempty, then drop.

Wait, the "gotoroom" action's effect is that you are no longer in front of any object. So after arriving in room_1, the agent is not in front of anything. So to drop, they need to be in front of an empty position. So:

After step 4, agent is in room_1. Then:

5. gotoempty (to be in front of empty spot)
6. drop grey_ball_2 room_1 (since agent is holding it, and in room_1, and in front of empty spot, this is allowed)

Then, to proceed to room_3:

7. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_3 (agent is in room_1)
8. toggle blue_door_1 (unlock)
9. gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_1 (now in room_3)
10. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_3 (since it's already there)
11. Now the agent is in room_3, in front of purple_ball_1. The goal is achieved.

But let's check if all steps are valid and constraints are met.

The constraint is that grey_ball_2 is in room_1 at some point. After step 6, it's in room_1, so that's satisfied.

Now, putting all steps together:

Initial state: in room_2, no object held.

Steps to get to room_4 and bring grey_ball_2 to room_1:

1. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_4
2. toggle purple_door_1 (unlock)
3. gotoroom room_2 room_4 purple_door_1
4. gotoobject grey_ball_2 room_4
5. pick grey_ball_2 room_4
6. gotoroom room_4 room_2 purple_door_1
7. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_1
8. toggle grey_door_1 (unlock)
9. gotoroom room_2 room_1 grey_door_1
10. gotoempty
11. drop grey_ball_2 room_1
12. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_3
13. toggle blue_door_1 (unlock)
14. gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_1
15. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_3

That's 15 steps. But maybe there's a shorter path.

Alternative path: Can the agent unlock doors in a different order to minimize steps?

Wait, perhaps after moving grey_ball_2 to room_1, the agent can then proceed to room_3. But maybe there's a way to combine some steps. Let me think.

But the key is that the agent must bring grey_ball_2 to room_1, which requires going to room_4, picking it up, then bringing it back. So steps 1-11 are necessary for that.

Alternatively, could the agent go from room_4 to room_3 via blue_door_2 (which connects 3 and 4), then go to room_3 and proceed? But then to get to room_1 from room_3, would need to unlock blue_door_1 (connecting 1 and 3), but that's in room_1 and 3. So if the agent is in room_3, can unlock blue_door_1 (if they go there), but then moving to room_1 from 3 requires blue_door_1 to be unlocked.

But in this scenario, the agent is carrying grey_ball_2 and needs to take it to room_1. Let's see:

Alternative path after step 5 (holding grey_ball_2 in room_4):

6. gotodoor blue_door_2 room_4 room_3 (unlocking it)
7. toggle blue_door_2 (unlock)
8. gotoroom room_4 room_3 blue_door_2 (now in room_3)
9. Then, need to get to room_1 from room_3. So unlock blue_door_1 (connects room_1 and 3). The agent is in room_3, so gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_1
10. toggle blue_door_1 (unlock)
11. gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_1 (now in room_1)
12. drop grey_ball_2 room_1 (after gotoempty)
13. Then proceed to room_3 via blue_door_1 again? No, because the agent is already in room_1. Wait, the goal is to be in room_3 in front of a purple ball. So after dropping grey_ball_2 in room_1, the agent needs to go back to room_3. So:

13. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_3
14. toggle blue_door_1 (unlock again? Wait, after step 10, it's unlocked. So no need to toggle again. So gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_1
15. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_3

This path might save some steps. Let's count:

Steps after step 5 (holding grey_ball_2 in room_4):

6. gotodoor blue_door_2 room_4 room_3
7. toggle blue_door_2
8. gotoroom room_4 room_3 blue_door_2
9. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_1
10. toggle blue_door_1
11. gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_1
12. gotoempty
13. drop grey_ball_2 room_1
14. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_3
15. gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_1
16. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_3

That's 16 steps from the start. But in the initial approach, it was 15 steps. So the first approach is shorter. But perhaps there's another way.

Wait, maybe when returning from room_4 to room_2, the agent can then go to room_1 via grey_door_1 (unlocking it), but that's what the first approach does.

Alternatively, maybe after unlocking purple_door_1 and grey_door_1, the agent can move more freely.

But let's compare the two approaches.

First approach steps (15 steps):

1. goto purple_door_1 (room2)
2. toggle purple_door_1
3. go to room4
4. goto grey_ball_2 (room4)
5. pick grey_ball_2
6. go back to room2 via purple_door_1
7. goto grey_door_1 (room2)
8. toggle grey_door_1
9. go to room1
10. gotoempty
11. drop grey_ball_2
12. goto blue_door_1 (room1)
13. toggle blue_door_1
14. go to room3
15. goto purple_ball_1

Second approach steps (after step5):

6. goto blue_door_2 (room4)
7. toggle
8. go to room3
9. goto blue_door_1 (room3)
10. toggle
11. go to room1
12. gotoempty
13. drop
14. goto blue_door_1 (room1)
15. go to room3
16. goto purple_ball_1

So the first approach is better. So total steps: 15.

But maybe there's a way to optimize further. Let's see.

Wait, in the first approach, step 6 is gotoroom room4 to room2 via purple_door_1. Then step 7 is gotodoor grey_door_1 in room2. Then step8: toggle. Then step9: go to room1. Then step10: gotoempty. Step11: drop. Step12: goto blue_door_1. Step13: toggle. Step14: goto room3. Step15: gotoobject.

But in step12, after dropping grey_ball_2 in room1, the agent is in room1. To go to blue_door_1, which connects to room3. So gotodoor blue_door_1 room1 room3. Then toggle (unlock), then goto room3. So steps 12-14.

Yes. So total steps: 15.

But is this the minimal possible?

Alternatively, maybe the agent can take the grey_ball_2 through room4 to room3, but that requires unlocking blue_door_2. Then from room3 to room1 via blue_door_1. But that's more steps.

Alternatively, what if the agent goes from room2 to room1 first, unlocks grey_door_1 and blue_door_1, then goes to room3, but then the constraint of moving grey_ball_2 to room1 isn't met. So that's not possible.

So the minimal plan must include moving grey_ball_2 to room1, which requires going to room4, getting it, and bringing it back.

So the steps as outlined in the first approach seem necessary.

Now, check for any possible optimizations:

After step3, agent is in room4. Then steps4: goto grey_ball_2. Step5: pick. Step6: go back to room2. Then steps7-9: unlock grey_door_1 and go to room1.

But when the agent is in room2 with grey_ball_2, can they drop it there? No, because the constraint requires it to be in room1. So must carry it to room1.

Alternatively, could the agent use the room_2 to room_4 path again? Not sure.

Alternatively, after step6 (back in room2), the agent is holding grey_ball_2. They need to go to room1. So they must unlock grey_door_1. So steps7-9 are needed.

Yes. So no shortcut here.

Another thing to consider: when the agent is in room2 after step6, they need to go to grey_door_1 (room2), unlock it, then go to room1, drop the ball, then proceed to unlock blue_door_1 and go to room3.

So the steps seem necessary.

Now, check the actions for preconditions:

For step1: gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_4. Agent is in room2, which is connected to room4 via purple_door_1. No objects blocking (since purple_box_2 is in room2, but is it blocking the door? The problem doesn't say any objects are blocking doors in the initial state. So assuming that the doors are not blocked, this is allowed. Then toggle unlocks it. Then gotoroom room2 to room4.

Yes.

In step4: gotoobject grey_ball_2 room4. Agent is in room4. So allowed.

Step5: pick grey_ball_2. Agent is in room4, not holding anything. So allowed.

Step6: gotoroom room4 room2 purple_door_1. The door is now unlocked. So allowed.

Step7: gotodoor grey_door_1 room2 room1. Agent in room2, connected via grey_door_1. No blocking objects. Then toggle unlocks it.

Step9: gotoroom room2 to room1 via grey_door_1. Door is now unlocked.

Step10: gotoempty. Always allowed.

Step11: drop grey_ball_2. Agent is holding it, in front of empty spot. So allowed.

Step12: gotodoor blue_door_1 room1 room3. Agent in room1, connected via blue_door_1. Door is locked. No blocking objects. Toggle unlocks it.

Step14: gotoroom room1 to room3. Door is now unlocked.

Step15: gotoobject purple_ball_1 room3. Agent in room3. Purple_ball_1 is there. So allowed.

So all preconditions are met.

The plan satisfies the goal (agent in room3, in front of a purple ball), and the constraint (grey_ball_2 is in room1 after step11).

So this should be a valid plan. Let me count the steps again to ensure optimality. Are there any steps that can be omitted?

For example, after step9 (agent is in room1), can they drop the grey_ball_2 immediately without going to empty? Because when you use gotoroom, you are no longer in front of anything. So in room1, agent is not in front of any object. To drop, you need to be in front of an empty position. So you need to gotoempty first. So steps10 and 11 are necessary.

Alternatively, can the agent drop the ball in the same step as moving? No, because the drop action requires being in front of an empty spot, which requires gotoempty.

So steps 10 and 11 are necessary.

Thus, the total steps are 15. Is there a way to make it shorter?

Another idea: After step3 (agent in room4), instead of picking grey_ball_2 immediately, perhaps the agent can first toggle blue_door_2 (room4 to room3), then go to room3, but that's not helpful unless they can find a quicker path.

But the grey_ball_2 is in room4, so it's necessary to pick it up there. So no shortcuts.

Another possible optimization: when the agent is in room4, after picking grey_ball_2, maybe go directly to room3 via blue_door_2, but then they would need to unlock it. So steps would be:

In room4:

5. pick grey_ball_2 room4

6. gotodoor blue_door_2 room4 room3

7. toggle blue_door_2

8. gotoroom room4 room3 blue_door_2 (now in room3, holding grey_ball_2)

Then, need to go to room1. So:

9. gotodoor blue_door_1 room3 room1

10. toggle blue_door_1

11. gotoroom room3 room1 blue_door_1

12. gotoempty

13. drop grey_ball_2 room1

14. then go back to room3:

gotodoor blue_door_1 room1 room3

gotoroom room1 room3 blue_door_1

15. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room3

This is 15 steps as well. So same length.

But the first approach may require more door toggles. Let's see which doors are toggled:

First approach:

- purple_door_1 (unlocked in step2)

- grey_door_1 (unlocked in step8)

- blue_door_1 (unlocked in step13)

Second approach:

- purple_door_1 (unlocked in step2)

- blue_door_2 (unlocked in step7)

- blue_door_1 (unlocked in step10)

Either way, three doors are toggled. So the steps are similar.

But the first approach may be better because the agent doesn't have to go through room3 with grey_ball_2. But both are same length. So either way, the plan is 15 steps.

But since the problem asks for an optimal plan, which is the shortest possible.

Is there a way to do it in fewer steps?

Wait, let's think differently. Suppose the agent unlocks grey_door_1 first, then goes to room1, unlocks blue_door_1, goes to room3. But then the constraint isn't met because grey_ball_2 remains in room4. So the agent must somehow move grey_ball_2 to room1.

Alternatively, after achieving the goal, the agent can then go back to room4 and move grey_ball_2 to room1, but the goal requires the agent to be in room3 in front of the ball. So after achieving the goal, the agent can't move anymore. Therefore, the movement of grey_ball_2 must happen before achieving the goal.

Thus, the steps involving moving grey_ball_2 must be part of the plan before the final steps to achieve the goal.

Therefore, the minimal plan must include steps to move grey_ball_2 to room1, which adds steps to the plan.

So the plan with 15 steps seems necessary.

Another possible optimization: after dropping grey_ball_2 in room1, the agent can immediately proceed to blue_door_1. So steps12-13:

After step11 (drop in room1), the agent is in room1, not holding anything. Then:

Step12: gotodoor blue_door_1 room1 room3

Step13: toggle blue_door_1

Step14: gotoroom room1 room3 blue_door_1

Step15: gotoobject purple_ball_1 room3

That's 15 steps. Correct.

Alternatively, can the agent combine any actions? For example, after step9 (arrive in room1), the agent can gotoempty and drop, then proceed to unlock blue_door_1.

But that's what is already done.

So I think the plan is as optimal as possible. Let's write the plan in the required format.
