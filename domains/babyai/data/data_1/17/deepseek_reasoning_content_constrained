Okay, let me try to figure out this planning problem. The goal is to end up in front of a red door that's unlocked. The constraints are that at some point, the red door must be locked, and if it's ever locked, then the grey door must be unlocked either at that state or later.

Starting in room_4. The doors are all locked initially. So first, I need to unlock the red door. But wait, the red door connects room_2 and room_4. But right now, I'm in room_4. To get to the red door, I need to go to room_2 through red_door_1? Wait, but the red door is locked. So maybe I need to unlock it first. But how? To toggle a door, I have to be in front of it. So maybe I need to get to the red door from room_4. Let's see: if I'm in room_4, can I go to the red door? The red door connects room_4 and room_2. So in room_4, the red door is present. So I can "gotodoor red_door_1 room4 room2". But the precondition is that there's no object blocking the position in front of the door in my current room. Are there any objects in front of the door in room_4? The initial state says that in room_4, there's green_box_1, blue_box_1, red_ball_2. But are any of these blocking the door? The problem description doesn't say anything about objects blocking doors initially. Wait, the initial state doesn't mention any objects blocking doors. So maybe all doors are unblocked. So I can go to red_door_1 in room_4. Then, toggle it to unlock. But wait, initially, all doors are locked, so toggling would unlock it. But then, the first constraint requires that at some state, red_door_1 is locked. So maybe I need to lock it again after unlocking. Hmm. Let's think.

The goal is to have a red door that's not locked and in front of it. So maybe the plan is to unlock the red door, then go in front of it. But the constraint says that red_door_1 must be locked in at least one state. So maybe we have to lock it first, then unlock it again. Wait, but how? Because initially, it's locked. So if we unlock it, then the initial state already has it locked. So maybe the initial state counts as a state where red_door_1 is locked. But the problem says the constraints must be satisfied. The first constraint is that "red_door_1 is locked" must hold in at least one state. The initial state has it locked, so that's already satisfied. But wait, the problem's constraints are part of the plan's requirements. So even if the initial state satisfies the first constraint, perhaps the plan needs to ensure that it's true in some state during execution. But since the initial state is part of the execution, that's already covered. So maybe the first constraint is already satisfied by the initial state. But the second constraint says that if in any state s, red_door_1 is locked, then in s or a subsequent state, grey_door_1 must be unlocked. So in the initial state, red_door_1 is locked. So in the initial state, grey_door_1 is also locked. Therefore, we need to ensure that after the initial state (since in the initial state, grey_door_1 is locked), there must be a state where grey_door_1 is unlocked. So during the plan, after the initial state, we need to unlock the grey door at some point.

Wait, the constraints are:

1. At least one state has red_door_1 locked. The initial state does, so that's okay.

2. If in any state s, red_door_1 is locked, then in s or after, grey_door_1 is not locked. So in the initial state s0, red_door_1 is locked, but grey_door_1 is also locked. So that violates the constraint unless in some subsequent state, grey_door_1 is unlocked. So during the plan, after the initial state, we need to unlock grey_door_1 at some point. Because the initial state is s0, and in s0, red is locked and grey is locked. So the constraint requires that in s0 or after, grey_door_1 is not locked. Since in s0 it's locked, we have to make sure that in some state after s0, grey_door_1 is unlocked.

So the plan must include unlocking the grey door. Also, the final goal is to be in front of a red door that's unlocked. Let's see: the red door is red_door_1 (since red_door_1 is red). So the plan needs to end with the agent in front of red_door_1, which is unlocked.

So the steps would be:

1. Unlock grey_door_1. But how? To unlock it, the agent needs to be in front of it. Grey_door_1 connects room_3 and room_4. The agent starts in room_4. So in room_4, the grey door is present. So go to grey_door_1 in room_4. Then toggle it (unlock). But the door is initially locked, so toggling unlocks it. Then, since the constraint requires that after any state where red is locked, grey is unlocked. Since the initial state is the only state where red is locked (if in the plan we unlock red_door_1), then we need to unlock grey_door_1 either in the initial state (impossible) or after. But since in the initial state, red is locked and grey is locked, the constraint says that in that state or after, grey must be unlocked. So we need to unlock grey_door_1 at some point after the initial state.

Wait, but the agent is in room_4. To get to the grey door in room_4, need to do gotodoor grey_door_1 room4 room3. Then toggle it. That would unlock it. Then, proceed to unlock red_door_1.

Wait, but the goal is to be in front of a red door (red_door_1) that's unlocked. So perhaps the steps are:

- Go to red_door_1 (room4 to room2 door) in room4.

But initially, red_door_1 is locked. To unlock it, need to toggle it. But to toggle, need to be in front of it. So:

1. goto_door red_door_1 room4 room2. Then toggle, which unlocks it. But then, the red_door_1 is now unlocked. So after this action, the red door is unlocked. But the constraint says that in some state, red_door_1 is locked. The initial state already has that. So that's okay. However, the second constraint says that whenever red_door_1 is locked, then in that state or later, grey_door_1 is unlocked. Since the initial state has red_door_1 locked and grey_door_1 locked, which violates the constraint unless after the initial state, we unlock grey_door_1. So in the plan, after the initial state, we need to unlock grey_door_1.

Wait, the initial state is part of the plan's execution. So the constraints must hold over all states. So the initial state is a state where red_door_1 is locked. According to constraint 2, in that state (s0), grey_door_1 must not be locked, or in some state after s0, grey_door_1 is not locked. But in s0, grey_door_1 is locked, so the constraint requires that in some state after s0, grey_door_1 is unlocked. So the plan must include unlocking the grey door.

So steps:

- Unlock grey_door_1 first. Because otherwise, after the initial state, the agent might unlock red_door_1 but then the constraint would require that the grey door is unlocked. Let me think.

Alternatively, let's outline possible steps:

1. In room_4, go to grey_door_1 (gotodoor grey_door_1 room4 room3). Since the agent is in room4, and grey_door_1 connects room4 and room3. Precondition: no object blocking the door in room4. The initial state in room4 has green_box_1, blue_box_1, red_ball_2. Are these blocking the door? The problem statement doesn't mention that. So assuming they are not blocking. So gotodoor is possible. Then toggle to unlock grey_door_1. Now grey_door_1 is unlocked. So now, the constraint is satisfied because after s0, the grey door is unlocked.

Then, handle the red door.

But the agent needs to get to the red door. The red door connects room4 and room2. So if the agent is in room4, can go to the red door, but initially it's locked. Wait, after unlocking grey_door_1, the agent is still in room4. Then, perhaps go to red_door_1 in room4, toggle it (unlocking it). Then, the red door is unlocked. Then, the agent is in front of the red door, which is unlocked. That would satisfy the goal.

Wait, the goal is to have a door d (which is red), you are in front of d, and d is not locked. So if the agent is in front of red_door_1 (which is red) and it's unlocked, then the goal is achieved.

So the steps could be:

1. gotodoor grey_door_1 room4 room3

2. toggle grey_door_1 (unlocking it)

3. gotodoor red_door_1 room4 room2

4. toggle red_door_1 (unlocking it)

Then, the agent is in front of red_door_1, which is now unlocked. But wait, after step 4, the toggle action would unlock the door (since it was locked). Then, the agent is in front of red_door_1, which is unlocked. So that would satisfy the goal.

But wait, the goal is "There is a door d such that d is red, you are in front of d, and d is not locked." So yes, after step 4, the agent is in front of red_door_1, which is now unlocked. So that would be the goal.

But let's check the constraints:

- The first constraint: "red_door_1 is locked" must hold in at least one state. The initial state has it locked, so that's satisfied.

- Second constraint: If in any state s, red_door_1 is locked, then in s or after, grey_door_1 is unlocked. In the initial state s0, red is locked. At s0, grey is locked. But after step 2, grey is unlocked. So after s0, in step 2, grey is unlocked. So the constraint is satisfied because in the state after step 2, grey is unlocked, which is after s0. So any state where red is locked (like s0) is followed by a state where grey is unlocked.

So this plan would satisfy the constraints.

But let's check the steps:

Start in room4.

Action 1: gotodoor grey_door_1 room4 room3. Now in front of grey_door_1.

Action 2: toggle grey_door_1 (unlocks it).

Action 3: gotodoor red_door_1 room4 room2. Now in front of red_door_1.

Action 4: toggle red_door_1 (unlocks it).

Now, in front of red_door_1, which is unlocked. So goal achieved.

But wait, the initial state of red_door_1 is locked. After step 4, it's unlocked. So the final state meets the goal. But the plan needs to end with the agent in front of red_door_1. So the actions are as above.

But wait, after step 4, the toggle action would have the agent in front of the door. So after step 4, the agent is in front of red_door_1, which is now unlocked. So the goal is achieved.

But the plan must be a sequence of actions. Let's check each action's preconditions.

Action 1: gotodoor grey_door_1 room4 room3.

Preconditions: agent is in a room connected via grey_door_1 (room4 is connected via grey_door_1 to room3), and no object is blocking the door in room4. Assuming no blocking, so allowed.

Action 2: toggle grey_door_1. Precondition: in front of grey_door_1. Which is true after action1.

Action3: gotodoor red_door_1 room4 room2. Preconditions: in room4 (still in room4?), and the door connects room4 and room2. Yes. And no blocking. So allowed.

Action4: toggle red_door_1. Precondition: in front of red_door_1. Yes, after action3. So all preconditions are met.

This plan seems valid. But let's check the constraints again. The first constraint is satisfied by the initial state. The second constraint: in s0 (initial), red is locked. Then, after action2, grey is unlocked. So in s0, the constraint requires that in s0 or after, grey is unlocked. Since after s0, in step2's effect, grey is unlocked, it's okay.

So this plan should work. The steps are:

goto door grey_door_1 room4 room3

toggle grey_door_1

goto door red_door_1 room4 room2

toggle red_door_1

But wait, when you perform "goto door", you have to specify the current room and the connected room. For example, for grey_door_1, it's connecting room4 and room3. So the action is gotodoor grey_door_1 room4 room3. Then, after that, toggle.

Then, gotodoor red_door_1 room4 room2. Then toggle.

Yes. So the plan is four steps. Let's check the final state: agent is in front of red_door_1, which is unlocked. So the goal is achieved. All constraints are satisfied.

But wait, the initial state's red_door_1 is locked. The first toggle on red_door_1 (step4) unlocks it. So in the final state, red_door_1 is unlocked, which meets the goal. The constraints are:

- At least one state where red is locked: yes, initial state.

- If any state where red is locked, then in that state or later, grey is unlocked. The initial state is the only state where red is locked. In the initial state, grey is locked. But in a later state (after action2), grey is unlocked. So the constraint is satisfied because after the initial state, there's a state (action2's effect) where grey is unlocked. Thus, whenever red is locked (which is only in the initial state), there exists a later state where grey is unlocked.

Therefore, the plan is valid.
