Alright, let's break down the problem and formulate a plan.

First, let's understand the goal:
- "There is a door d such that "The following conditions are all true: "d is red", "you are in front of d", "d is not locked"""

So, we need to:
1. Find a red door (which is red_door_1 based on the information provided).
2. Go in front of it.
3. Make sure it's unlocked.

Now, let's consider the constraints:
1. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: "red_door_1 is locked"". This means at some point during our plan, red_door_1 must be locked. Given that red_door_1 is initially locked, this constraint is already satisfied.
2. "If expression "red_door_1 is locked" holds in some state s, then expression "grey_door_1 is not locked" must hold at s or at some state after s". This means after red_door_1 is locked (which it initially is), at some point, grey_door_1 must be unlocked.

Now, let's think about how to achieve the goal:
- red_door_1 connects room_2 and room_4.
- We are currently in room_4.
- We need to go in front of red_door_1 and toggle it to unlock it.

However, remember the precondition for the "toggle" action: "you may only toggle a door d if you are in front of d."

So, our steps could be:
1. Go in front of red_door_1 from room_4 (using the "gotodoor" action).
2. Toggle red_door_1 to unlock it (using the "toggle" action).

But, before we execute our plan, we need to consider the second constraint: after red_door_1 is locked (which it initially is), at some point, grey_door_1 must be unlocked. So, we need to include a step to unlock grey_door_1.

Let's reconsider our plan:
1. Go in front of grey_door_1 from room_4 (using the "gotodoor" action).
2. Toggle grey_door_1 to unlock it (which satisfies the second constraint).
3. Go in front of red_door_1 from room_4 (using the "gotodoor" action).
4. Toggle red_door_1 to unlock it.

Wait, but this might create a problem. If we toggle red_door_1 immediately after toggling grey_door_1, the second constraint might not be satisfied, since the state where red_door_1 is locked and grey_door_1 is not locked never happens.

So, let's be careful:
1. Go in front of grey_door_1 from room_4 (using the "gotodoor" action).
2. Toggle grey_door_1 to unlock it (which satisfies the second constraint, because at this state, red_door_1 is still locked).
3. Go in front of red_door_1 from room_4 (using the "gotodoor" action).
4. Toggle red_door_1 to unlock it.

Wait, the second constraint states: "If expression "red_door_1 is locked" holds in some state s, then expression "grey_door_1 is not locked" must hold at s or at some state after s". 
Since red_door_1 is initially locked, we need to unlock grey_door_1 at some state after that. So I think our plan is correct.

Let's formalize the plan:

```
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3
toggle grey_door_1
gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2
toggle red_door_1
```

Wait, I need to double-check if there's anything else we need to consider.

Let me review the preconditions:
- "goto door": you may only go in front of a door d if (i) you are in a room which door d is connecting with another room, and (ii) there is no object blocking the position in front of d in the room you are currently in.

Are there any objects blocking the doors? I don't see any information about objects blocking doors, so I assume there are none. (The information would be in the form of "object_x is blocking door_y", which I don't see in the provided description.)

So, our plan seems valid. Let's check it step by step:

1. "gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3": This action meets the preconditions because (i) we are in room_4, which is connected to room_3 via grey_door_1, and (ii) there's no mention of any object blocking the door.
2. "toggle grey_door_1": This action meets the precondition because after the previous action, we are in front of grey_door_1.
3. "gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2": This action meets the preconditions because (i) we are in room_4, which is connected to room_2 via red_door_1, and (ii) there's no mention of any object blocking the door.
4. "toggle red_door_1": This action meets the precondition because after the previous action, we are in front of red_door_1.

After executing these actions, we will be in front of red_door_1, and it will be unlocked, satisfying the goal condition. Moreover, during the execution, grey_door_1 becomes unlocked while red_door_1 is still locked, satisfying the constraint.

So, our finalized plan is the one I outlined above.

Let me quickly review each step again to make sure I'm getting the action formats correct:

1. "gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3": This action is "gotodoor d r1 r2", where d is the door, r1 is our current room, and r2 is the room on the other side of the door. The precondition is met because we're in room_4, and grey_door_1 connects room_4 and room_3.
2. "toggle grey_door_1": This action is "toggle d", where d is the door. The precondition is met because we're in front of grey_door_1.
3. "gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2": Similar to the first action.
4. "toggle red_door_1": Similar to the second action.

Actually, the more I think about it, the more I'm doubting the "gotodoor" action. Let me revisit the definition to make sure I'm getting it right:

From the provided actions:
"gotodoor d r1 r2": Go in front of door d, connecting room r1 to room r2.

And the preconditions:
"goto door": you may only go in front of a door d if (i) you are in a room which door d is connecting with another room, and (ii) there is no object blocking the position in front of d in the room you are currently in.

So, for gotodoor, we need to specify the door and the two rooms it's connecting. The precondition is that we're in one of those rooms.

For the "red_door_1" I'm questioning whether I'm in room_4 or room_2 when I'm in front of it. But I think it doesn't matter, since room_4 and room_2 are the only rooms connected by this door.

Alright, I'm confident in my plan.
Wait, let me just double-check the goal once more: 

"There is a door d such that "The following conditions are all true: "d is red", "you are in front of d", "d is not locked"""

So we need:
1. A red door
2. To be in front of that door
3. That door to be unlocked

From the provided objects, we know "red_door_1 is red". So, the goal is to get in front of red_door_1 and for it to be unlocked. My plan achieves this.

And I believe the plan is optimal, since it minimizes the number of steps required.

Let's finalize the plan:

```
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3
toggle grey_door_1
gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2
toggle red_door_1
```

This meets the goal and constraints.

Oh wait, let me just double-check one of the constraints again: "The following expression must hold in at least one state: "red_door_1 is locked""

Given the information, "red_door_1 is locked" holds initially. So this constraint is already met. And then the second constraint: "If expression "red_door_1 is locked" holds in some state s, then expression "grey_door_1 is not locked" must hold at s or at some state after s"

This means once red_door_1 is locked (which it is initially), at some point grey_door_1 shouldn't be locked. Our plan adheres to this by first unlocking grey_door_1.

Okay, my plan is correct, and I'm confident in its optimality.

```
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3
toggle grey_door_1
gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2
toggle red_door_1
```

Actually, I want to double-check my understanding of what "goto door" action does:

"The actions of this domain have the following effects:
	"goto object": After performing this action regarding an object x, (i) if you were in front of some object or door x0, then you are no longer in front of x0 and (ii) you are in front of object x.
	"goto empty": After performing this action, (i) if you were in front of some object or door x0, then you are no longer in front of x0 and (ii) you are in front of an empty position.
	"goto door": After performing this action regarding a door d, (i) if you were in front of some object or door x0, then you are no longer in front of x0 and (ii) you are in front of door d."

So `gotodoor` just puts us in front of the door. We're still in the same room, but we're in front of the door. It doesn't move us to another room.

Let's refine my understanding of the actions:
- "gotodoor d r1 r2": Takes us in front of door d from room r1, which is connected to room r2 via door d.
- "gotoroom r1 r2 d": Takes us from room r1 to room r2 using door d.

So, to be clear, I initially thought `gotodoor` was the same as `gotoroom`, but they are different. `gotodoor` just puts us in front of the door, while `gotoroom` actually takes us through the door to another room.

So with that updated understanding, my plan looks correct:

```
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3
toggle grey_door_1
gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2
toggle red_door_1
```

We start in room_4. We go in front of the grey door (which connects to room_3), toggle it to unlock it. Then we go in front of the red door (which connects to room_2), and toggle it to unlock it.

After executing this plan, we're in front of red_door_1, and it's unlocked. This satisfies the goal. And during the execution, we've also unlocked grey_door_1 while red_door_1 was still locked, satisfying the second constraint.

I stand by this plan. Note that we could potentially go back to the grey door, toggle it to lock it again, go in front of red door, and toggle it, but this introduces more steps and can make the plan less optimal. Since going through doors is not part of the goal, staying in the same room is the most efficient.

Plan:
```
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3
toggle grey_door_1
gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2
toggle red_door_1
```

Yep, that's the optimal 4-step plan I'm confident about. Here it is one more time:
```
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3
toggle grey_door_1
gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2
toggle red_door_1
```
