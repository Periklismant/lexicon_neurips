Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. The goal is to have a grey box that I'm in front of. The constraints say I can never enter room_4. Let's start by understanding the initial state.

I'm in room_3 initially. The grey boxes are grey_box_1 in room_2, grey_box_2 in room_4, and grey_box_1 is in room_2. But wait, room_4 is off-limits, so grey_box_2 is out of the question. So the target must be grey_box_1 in room_2 or grey_box_1 in room_2. Wait, looking back: "grey_box_1 is in room_2" and "grey_box_2 is in room_4". So the only possible grey boxes I can access are grey_box_1 in room_2. Because room_4 is forbidden, so I can't go there.

So the goal is to be in front of grey_box_1 in room_2. But how do I get to room_2 from room_3? Let's check the doors. The doors are:

- room_1 and room_2 connected via purple_door_1.
- room_1 and room_3 connected via grey_door_1.
- room_2 and room_4 via red_door_1 (but we can't go to room_4).
- room_3 and room_4 via green_door_1 (also can't use that).

So the initial position is room_3. To get to room_2, possible paths would be room_3 -> room_1 via grey_door_1, then room_1 -> room_2 via purple_door_1. But all doors are initially locked. So I need to unlock those doors.

First, check which doors are in the current room. Since I'm in room_3, the doors connecting to room_3 are grey_door_1 (to room_1) and green_door_1 (to room_4). But green_door_1 leads to room_4, which is forbidden. So the only door from room_3 is grey_door_1 to room_1. But it's locked. So to unlock it, I need to toggle it. But to toggle a door, I need to be in front of it. So first, go to the grey_door_1 in room_3. But wait, in the preconditions for gotodoor, I need to be in a room connected by that door, and no object is blocking the position in front of the door.

Are there any objects blocking the door in room_3? The initial state says room_3 has blue_box_1 and purple_box_1. If either of these is in front of the door, then gotodoor would not be possible. But the problem statement doesn't mention any objects blocking doors. Wait, the initial state doesn't state that any objects are blocking doors. So by default, maybe the doors are not blocked. So maybe I can go to the grey_door_1 in room_3.

So the steps would be:

1. From room_3, go to the grey_door_1 (which connects room_3 to room_1).
   Action: gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1
2. Toggle the door to unlock it.
   Action: toggle grey_door_1
3. Then go through the door to room_1.
   Action: gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1
4. Now in room_1. From here, need to get to room_2. The door between room_1 and room_2 is purple_door_1, which is locked. So I need to unlock that. But to do that, I have to be in front of it. So go to purple_door_1 in room_1.
   Action: gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2
5. Toggle purple_door_1 to unlock it.
   Action: toggle purple_door_1
6. Then go through purple_door_1 to room_2.
   Action: gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1
7. Now in room_2. The grey_box_1 is here. Need to go to it.
   Action: gotoobject grey_box_1 room_2
8. Now in front of grey_box_1. The goal is achieved.

But wait, the goal is that there exists a grey box that I'm in front of. So the plan should end here. Let's check constraints: never enter room_4. All steps stay in room_3, then room_1, then room_2. No room_4. So that's okay.

Now let's check if all preconditions are met for each action.

Starting in room_3. First action: gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1. Preconditions: I'm in a room connected by the door (yes, room_3 is connected to room_1 via grey_door_1). Also, no object is blocking the door's position in room_3. Since initial state doesn't mention any objects blocking doors, this should be okay.

Then toggle the door. Must be in front of it. After gotodoor, I'm in front of the door. So toggle is allowed.

Then gotoroom to room_1. Preconditions: current room is room_3, adjacent via door grey_door_1, which is now unlocked. So that's okay.

In room_1, then gotodoor purple_door_1. Again, room_1 is connected to room_2 via purple_door_1. No blocking object. Then toggle it, then gotoroom to room_2. Finally, gotoobject grey_box_1 in room_2.

Yes, this seems valid. The plan length is 6 actions: gotodoor, toggle, gotoroom, gotodoor, toggle, gotoroom, gotoobject. Wait, let's count:

1. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1
2. toggle grey_door_1
3. gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1
4. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2
5. toggle purple_door_1
6. gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1
7. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_2

That's 7 actions. Is there a shorter way? Let's see. Is there another path? For example, is there a way to unlock both doors without moving back and forth?

Wait, maybe after unlocking grey_door_1 and going to room_1, the purple_door_1 is in room_1. So steps 4 and 5 are necessary. No way around that. So 7 steps is the minimum. Let me check again.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a way to use other doors. But the other doors from room_1 are grey_door_1 (already used) and perhaps the door to room_2 (purple_door_1). So no, no other doors. So this seems correct.

Another check: when moving from room_3 to room_1, after toggling grey_door_1, the door is now unlocked, allowing passage. Then, after moving to room_1, the purple_door_1 is locked, so must unlock it. So steps 4-6 are necessary.

Yes, this plan should work. Let me write it out properly.
