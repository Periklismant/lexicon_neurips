Alright, let's analyze the problem:

1. I'm an agent in a gridworld with 4 rooms arranged in a square.
2. Currently, I'm in room_3.
3. My goal is to be in front of a grey box.
4. I cannot go to room_4 at any point.

Let's look at the available grey boxes:
- grey_box_1 is in room_2
- grey_box_2 is in room_4

Since I'm not allowed to go to room_4, I can't be in front of grey_box_2. So my goal is to be in front of grey_box_1, which is in room_2.

I'm currently in room_3, and I need to reach room_2. I can't go through room_4 because of the constraint. So I'll have to go through room_1.

The path would be: room_3 -> room_1 -> room_2

Let's check the doors along this path:
- room_3 and room_1 are connected via grey_door_1 (which is locked)
- room_1 and room_2 are connected via purple_door_1 (which is locked)

I'll need to unlock these doors.

Let's plan:

1. Go to grey_door_1 in room_3.
2. Toggle grey_door_1 to unlock it.
3. Go to room_1 through grey_door_1.
4. Go to purple_door_1 in room_1.
5. Toggle purple_door_1 to unlock it.
6. Go to room_2 through purple_door_1.
7. Go to grey_box_1 in room_2.

Now, let's translate this into the action sequence:

1. gotoobject grey_door_1 room_3: Go in front of door grey_door_1 in room_3.
   (Actually, I need to use the "gotodoor" action, not "gotoobject". Let me correct that.)
   gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1: Go in front of grey_door_1, which connects room_3 and room_1.
2. toggle grey_door_1: Unlock grey_door_1.
3. gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1: Go to room_1 from room_3 using grey_door_1.
4. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2: Go in front of purple_door_1, which connects room_1 and room_2.
5. toggle purple_door_1: Unlock purple_door_1.
6. gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1: Go to room_2 from room_1 using purple_door_1.
7. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_2: Go in front of grey_box_1 in room_2.

Let's check if this plan satisfies the constraints:
- I'm never in room_4.
- At the end, I'm in front of a grey box.

Yes, this should be a valid plan. Let me double-check:

1. I start in room_3.
2. I go to room_1 via grey_door_1 (after unlocking it).
3. I go to room_2 via purple_door_1 (after unlocking it).
4. I end up in front of grey_box_1 in room_2.

And I'm never in room_4, so it satisfies the constraint.

Hmm, I'm second-guessing myself on the gotodoor action. Let me re-examine its description:

"gotodoor d r1 r2": Go in front of door d, connecting room r1 to room r2.

The precondition says:
- I may only go in front of a door d if 
  (i) I am in a room which door d is connecting with another room, and 
  (ii) there is no object blocking the position in front of d in the room I'm currently in.

Since I'm in room_3, and grey_door_1 connects room_3 to room_1, I can go in front of grey_door_1 using this action.

I think the action is:
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1

But I'm not entirely sure if this is the correct syntax, especially for the room parameters. I might need to double-check.

Actually, I was overthinking this. The "gotodoor" action is "Go in front of door d, connecting room r1 to room r2." Since grey_door_1 connects room_3 and room_1, the action should be "gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1". This is consistent with what I had before.

So, the plan is as I outlined above:
1. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1
2. toggle grey_door_1
3. gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1
4. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2
5. toggle purple_door_1
6. gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1
7. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_2

I think this plan is optimal (i.e., it uses the minimum number of actions required to achieve the goal).

Wait, let me make sure I'm getting the optimal solution. Could there be a more direct route? Let's see.

I'm in room_3, and I want to go to room_2.
Room_3 is connected to room_1 (via grey_door_1) and room_4 (via green_door_1).
But I can't go to room_4 due to the constraint.
So I have to go through room_1.
room_1 is connected to room_2 (via purple_door_1).

So the path is: room_3 -> room_1 -> room_2.

There's no more direct route, so my plan is optimal.

Let me finalize the plan:

1. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1
2. toggle grey_door_1
3. gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1
4. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2
5. toggle purple_door_1
6. gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1
7. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_2

This is the most direct route to achieve the goal while respecting the constraint. It's an optimal plan.
