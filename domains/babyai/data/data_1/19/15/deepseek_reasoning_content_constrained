Okay, let's try to figure out how to solve this planning problem. The goal is to be in front of a yellow door that's unlocked. There are a couple of yellow doors: yellow_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3, and yellow_door_2 connects room_3 and room_4. The constraints say that at some point, yellow_door_2 must be unlocked, and before that, the agent must have held yellow_ball_1.

First, the initial state: the agent is in room_4. The yellow_ball_1 is in room_1. All doors are locked initially. So the agent needs to unlock a yellow door, specifically yellow_door_2, but to do that, they need to hold the yellow_ball_1 first.

Wait, the constraint says that if yellow_door_2 is unlocked at any state, then there must have been a previous state where the agent was holding yellow_ball_1. So the agent must pick up yellow_ball_1 at some point before unlocking yellow_door_2.

But yellow_ball_1 is in room_1. The agent starts in room_4. To get to room_1, the agent needs to navigate through the doors. Let's see the connections:

From room_4, the connected rooms are room_2 via green_door_1 and room_3 via yellow_door_2. All doors are locked. So the agent can't go anywhere from room_4 unless they unlock doors first. But to unlock a door, they need to be in front of it and toggle it. But doors are locked, so they can't go through them. Wait, but how can they unlock a door if they can't reach it? Because to go to a door, they need to be in a room connected by that door, and the door is locked. Wait, the "goto door" action's preconditions are that you are in a room connected by the door, and there's no object blocking the position in front of the door. So even if the door is locked, you can go in front of it. Then, once there, you can toggle it (unlock it). But the problem is that the doors are locked, but the agent is in room_4. So for example, yellow_door_2 connects room_4 and room_3. So the agent can go to yellow_door_2 from room_4. Let's check the preconditions for "gotodoor d r1 r2": the agent must be in a room connected by the door. Since the agent is in room_4, and yellow_door_2 connects room_4 and room_3, they can go to the door. Then, toggle it (unlock). But wait, the constraint requires that before unlocking yellow_door_2, the agent must have held yellow_ball_1. But the yellow_ball_1 is in room_1, which is far away. So maybe the agent needs to go to room_1, get the yellow_ball_1, then come back to room_4, unlock yellow_door_2, and then be in front of it.

Wait, but how can the agent get to room_1? The initial doors are all locked. Let's see:

From room_4, the agent can go to yellow_door_2 (since they are in room_4). So:

1. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_3

But the door is locked. Then toggle it (unlock). But the problem is that the agent needs to hold yellow_ball_1 before unlocking yellow_door_2. So that's a problem. Because if they unlock yellow_door_2 first, the constraint is violated. So the agent must first get the yellow_ball_1, then unlock yellow_door_2. But to get yellow_ball_1 in room_1, the agent has to reach room_1. Let's see the possible path.

From room_4, the agent is stuck unless they can unlock doors. Let's see the doors connected to room_4: green_door_1 (connects to room_2) and yellow_door_2 (connects to room_3). Both are locked. So the agent can go to these doors but can't pass through them unless they are unlocked. But to unlock them, they need to toggle them. So:

First, the agent can go to yellow_door_2 (since they are in room_4). So:

Action: gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_3

Then toggle it. But this would unlock it, which would allow passage. However, according to the constraints, if they unlock yellow_door_2, they must have held yellow_ball_1 before. But they haven't yet. So that's a problem.

Therefore, the agent cannot unlock yellow_door_2 first. So maybe they need to take a different path. Let's look at the other doors. For example, green_door_1 connects room_4 and room_2. The agent is in room_4. So they can go to green_door_1. Then toggle it. But green_door_1 is green, and the constraints don't mention it. But unlocking it might help the agent reach room_2, then perhaps go to room_1 via purple_door_1. Let's see:

So agent is in room_4.

1. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2
2. toggle green_door_1 (unlock)
3. gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_1

Now in room_2. Then, room_2 is connected to room_1 via purple_door_1, which is locked. So agent can go to purple_door_1 in room_2.

4. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1
5. toggle purple_door_1 (unlock)
6. gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1

Now in room_1, where yellow_ball_1 is located.

7. gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_1
8. pick yellow_ball_1 room_1

Now holding yellow_ball_1. Then, the agent needs to go back to room_4 and unlock yellow_door_2. Let's see the path back.

From room_1, go back to room_2 via purple_door_1 (already unlocked), then room_2 to room_4 via green_door_1 (already unlocked). Then in room_4, go to yellow_door_2.

But the constraint requires that when yellow_door_2 is unlocked (which will be the next step), the agent has held yellow_ball_1 in a previous state. Since they just picked it up, that's satisfied.

So steps:

9. gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1
10. gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1
11. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_3
12. toggle yellow_door_2 (unlock it)

Now, after step 12, yellow_door_2 is unlocked. The agent is in front of it. So the goal is to have a yellow door (which yellow_door_2 is) that's unlocked, and the agent is in front of it. So step 12 would satisfy the goal. Then the plan should end here.

Wait, but the goal is "There is a door d such that d is yellow, you are in front of d, and d is not locked." So after step 12, the agent is in front of yellow_door_2, which is now unlocked. So that's the goal. So the plan should end here.

But let's check all constraints. The constraint is that in at least one state, yellow_door_2 is not locked. Which happens in step 12. Also, before that, the agent was holding yellow_ball_1 (steps 8-12). So this satisfies the constraints.

Now, let's check if the plan is possible.

Step-by-step:

1. Initial state: in room_4, all doors locked, holding nothing.

Action 1: gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2. Preconditions: agent is in a room connected by green_door_1 (room_4 is connected via green_door_1 to room_2). Also, no object is blocking the position in front of the door in room_4. Since the initial state doesn't mention any objects blocking doors in room_4, this is allowed.

After action 1: agent is in front of green_door_1 in room_4.

Action 2: toggle green_door_1. Precondition: must be in front of it. Yes. Effect: green_door_1 is now unlocked.

Action 3: gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_1. Preconditions: current room is room_4, adjacent to room_2 via green_door_1, which is now unlocked. So allowed. Effect: agent is in room_2, not in front of anything.

Action 4: gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1. Precondition: agent is in room_2, which is connected via purple_door_1. No objects blocking. So allowed. Now in front of purple_door_1.

Action 5: toggle purple_door_1. Now purple_door_1 is unlocked.

Action 6: gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1. Now in room_1.

Action 7: gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_1. Precondition: in same room as yellow_ball_1. Yes. Now in front of it.

Action 8: pick yellow_ball_1 room_1. Preconditions: holding nothing. Yes. Now holding yellow_ball_1.

Action 9: gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1. Go back to room_2. Door is unlocked.

Action 10: gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1. Back to room_4.

Action 11: gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_3. Precondition: in room_4, connected via yellow_door_2. Allowed.

Action 12: toggle yellow_door_2. Unlock it. Now yellow_door_2 is unlocked. Agent is in front of it. So the goal is achieved.

This plan should work. Let's check the constraints:

- The state after action 12 has yellow_door_2 unlocked. So the first constraint (at least one state where yellow_door_2 is not locked) is satisfied.

- Before that, in action 8, the agent picks up yellow_ball_1, so in a previous state (after action 8), the agent is holding it. So the second constraint is satisfied.

Thus, this plan should be valid. Let's check the actions again for preconditions and effects. Each step seems to meet preconditions. Also, the plan length is 12 steps. Is there a shorter way?

Wait, perhaps there's a shortcut. Let's see.

Alternative approach: The agent is in room_4. To get to room_1, maybe there's another path. For example, via room_3. But room_3 is connected to room_1 via yellow_door_1, which is locked. So agent can't go through that unless they unlock yellow_door_1.

But the agent is in room_4. To get to room_3, they need to go through yellow_door_2. But that's locked. So initial steps would require unlocking yellow_door_2. But according to the constraints, if they unlock yellow_door_2, they need to have held yellow_ball_1 before. So that's a problem. Therefore, the first approach is necessary.

So the initial plan is the correct path. Let's write it out.
