Let's understand the problem.

We have a 2D gridworld with 4 rooms arranged in a square formation: room_1 (north-west), room_2 (south-west), room_3 (north-east), and room_4 (south-east). The rooms are connected via 4 doors, as follows:
- room_1 and room_2 are connected via purple_door_1
- room_1 and room_3 are connected via yellow_door_1
- room_2 and room_4 are connected via green_door_1
- room_3 and room_4 are connected via yellow_door_2

Initially, all doors are locked. We start in room_4.

The goal is to have a yellow door that is unlocked, and we must be in front of it.

There are two yellow doors: yellow_door_1 and yellow_door_2. From the constraints, we're told that yellow_door_2 must be unlocked at some point. We're also told that if yellow_door_2 is unlocked, then there must be an earlier state where we're holding yellow_ball_1.

So our plan needs to include:
1. Obtaining yellow_ball_1 (which is in room_1).
2. Somehow unlocking yellow_door_2 (which connects room_3 and room_4).
3. Ending up in front of an unlocked yellow door (either yellow_door_1 or yellow_door_2).

The constraint says "yellow_door_2 is not locked" in some state, and if that's true, then there's an earlier state where we hold yellow_ball_1. This implies that having yellow_ball_1 is a prerequisite for unlocking yellow_door_2.

So, let's first figure out how to get yellow_ball_1 from room_1:

Starting in room_4, we need to get to room_1. We can go:
- room_4 -> room_2 (via green_door_1)
- room_2 -> room_1 (via purple_door_1)

But all doors are locked. So we need to figure out how to unlock them.

The only way to unlock a door is to use the "toggle" action, which we can only do if we're in front of the door.

So, let's say we try to go to room_1 via room_2:
1. Get in front of green_door_1 in room_4.
2. Toggle green_door_1 to unlock it.
3. Go to room_2 via green_door_1.
4. Get in front of purple_door_1 in room_2.
5. Toggle purple_door_1 to unlock it.
6. Go to room_1 via purple_door_1.
7. Pick up yellow_ball_1 in room_1.

Now that we have yellow_ball_1, we need to unlock yellow_door_2 (which connects room_3 and room_4).

We're in room_1 now. To get to room_3:
8. Get in front of yellow_door_1 in room_1.
9. Toggle yellow_door_1 to unlock it.
10. Go to room_3 via yellow_door_1.
11. Get in front of yellow_door_2 in room_3.
12. Toggle yellow_door_2 to unlock it.

Now yellow_door_2 is unlocked, and we're already in front of it. 

But wait, there's a problem. The constraint says that if yellow_door_2 is unlocked, then there must be an earlier state where we're holding yellow_ball_1. But if we toggle yellow_door_2 while holding yellow_ball_1, we would still be holding it. We need to make sure there's a state where we're holding yellow_ball_1 but yellow_door_2 is still locked.

Actually, I think I'm interpreting the constraint correctly. We just need to make sure that we have held yellow_ball_1 before we unlock yellow_door_2. It doesn't matter if we drop it or are still holding it when we unlock the door.

Let's make sure our plan is correct:
1. Get in front of green_door_1 in room_4.
2. Toggle green_door_1 to unlock it.
3. Go to room_2 via green_door_1.
4. Get in front of purple_door_1 in room_2.
5. Toggle purple_door_1 to unlock it.
6. Go to room_1 via purple_door_1.
7. Goto object yellow_ball_1 in room_1.
8. Pick up yellow_ball_1 in room_1.
9. Get in front of yellow_door_1 in room_1.
10. Toggle yellow_door_1 to unlock it.
11. Go to room_3 via yellow_door_1.
12. Get in front of yellow_door_2 in room_3.
13. Toggle yellow_door_2 to unlock it.

Now yellow_door_2 is unlocked, and we're already in front of it.

Let's see if this plan satisfies the constraints:
- yellow_door_2 is unlocked (after step 13).
- Before yellow_door_2 is unlocked, we've held yellow_ball_1 (from step 8).
- We end up in front of an unlocked yellow door (yellow_door_2).

I think this plan should work.

Wait, let me carefully check the actions.

1. "gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2" - This action is valid because green_door_1 connects room_4 and room_2, and we're in room_4.
2. "toggle green_door_1" - This action is valid because we're now in front of green_door_1.
3. "gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_1" - This action is valid because we're in room_4, room_2 is adjacent to room_4, and green_door_1 (which connects them) is now unlocked.
4. "gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1" - This action is valid because purple_door_1 connects room_2 and room_1, and we're in room_2.
5. "toggle purple_door_1" - This action is valid because we're now in front of purple_door_1.
6. "gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1" - This action is valid because we're in room_2, room_1 is adjacent to room_2, and purple_door_1 (which connects them) is now unlocked.
7. "gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_1" - This action is valid because yellow_ball_1 is in room_1, and we're in room_1.
8. "pick yellow_ball_1 room_1" - This action is valid because we're in front of yellow_ball_1 in room_1, and our hands are empty.
9. "gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3" - This action is valid because yellow_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3, and we're in room_1.
10. "toggle yellow_door_1" - This action is valid because we're now in front of yellow_door_1.
11. "gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1" - This action is valid because we're in room_1, room_3 is adjacent to room_1, and yellow_door_1 (which connects them) is now unlocked.
12. "gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_3 room_4" - This action is valid because yellow_door_2 connects room_3 and room_4, and we're in room_3.
13. "toggle yellow_door_2" - This action is valid because we're now in front of yellow_door_2.

At this point, there's one issue I noticed. The plan assumes that after toggling a door, we're still in front of it. But from the effects of the "toggle" action, it's not clear if we remain in front of the door after toggling it. Let's check if there's any effect that says we're no longer in front of the door after toggling.

From the description of the effects:
"toggle": After performing this action on a door d, (i) if d was locked, then it becomes unlocked, and (ii) if d was unlocked, then it becomes locked.

There's no mention of changing our position relative to the door. So I'll assume that after toggling, we're still in front of the door. This means the plan is correct. Just to be safe, I'll list out all the actions more explicitly:

1. "gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2" - Go in front of green_door_1 in room_4.
2. "toggle green_door_1" - Unlock green_door_1.
3. "gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_1" - Go to room_2 from room_4 using green_door_1.
4. "gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1" - Go in front of purple_door_1 in room_2.
5. "toggle purple_door_1" - Unlock purple_door_1.
6. "gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1" - Go to room_1 from room_2 using purple_door_1.
7. "gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_1" - Go in front of yellow_ball_1 in room_1.
8. "pick yellow_ball_1 room_1" - Pick up yellow_ball_1 in room_1.
9. "gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3" - Go in front of yellow_door_1 in room_1.
10. "toggle yellow_door_1" - Unlock yellow_door_1.
11. "gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1" - Go to room_3 from room_1 using yellow_door_1.
12. "gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_3 room_4" - Go in front of yellow_door_2 in room_3.
13. "toggle yellow_door_2" - Unlock yellow_door_2.

At the end of this plan, we have unlocked yellow_door_2 and we're in front of it. We've also held yellow_ball_1 before unlocking yellow_door_2, which satisfies the constraint. So this is a valid solution to the problem.

Actually, rereading the constraints, it seems like we can end up with either yellow_door_1 or yellow_door_2 being unlocked, as long as we're in front of it at the end, and the condition for unlocking yellow_door_2 is satisfied. The condition for unlocking yellow_door_2 states that if yellow_door_2 is unlocked, then at an earlier state, we should have been holding yellow_ball_1.

But given that we're starting in room_4, and yellow_door_2 connects room_3 and room_4, it seems more straightforward to unlock yellow_door_2 and end up in front of it, rather than yellow_door_1.

Let me just double-check the solution:

Condition 1: "There is a door d such that 'The following conditions are all true: d is yellow', 'you are in front of d', 'd is not locked'"
- In our solution, we end up in front of yellow_door_2 in room_3, and yellow_door_2 is unlocked. Yellow_door_2 is yellow. So this condition is satisfied.

Condition 2: "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'yellow_door_2 is not locked'"
- In our solution, after step 13, yellow_door_2 is unlocked. So this condition is satisfied.

Condition 3: "If expression 'yellow_door_2 is not locked' holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: 'you are holding yellow_ball_1'"
- In our solution, after step 8, we're holding yellow_ball_1, and after step 13, yellow_door_2 is unlocked. Since step 8 happens before step 13, this condition is satisfied.

OK, let's double-check the actions again.

1. "gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2"
   - Precondition: We're in room_4, and green_door_1 connects room_4 and room_2. This is true.
   - Effect: We're now in front of green_door_1.

2. "toggle green_door_1"
   - Precondition: We're in front of green_door_1. This is true after action 1.
   - Effect: green_door_1 becomes unlocked.

3. "gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_1"
   - Precondition: We're in room_4, room_2 is adjacent to room_4, and green_door_1 (which connects them) is unlocked. This is true after action 2.
   - Effect: We're now in room_2 and no longer in front of green_door_1.

4. "gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1"
   - Precondition: We're in room_2, and purple_door_1 connects room_2 and room_1. This is true after action 3.
   - Effect: We're now in front of purple_door_1.

5. "toggle purple_door_1"
   - Precondition: We're in front of purple_door_1. This is true after action 4.
   - Effect: purple_door_1 becomes unlocked.

6. "gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1"
   - Precondition: We're in room_2, room_1 is adjacent to room_2, and purple_door_1 (which connects them) is unlocked. This is true after action 5.
   - Effect: We're now in room_1 and no longer in front of purple_door_1.

7. "gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_1"
   - Precondition: We're in room_1, and yellow_ball_1 is in room_1. This is true after action 6.
   - Effect: We're now in front of yellow_ball_1.

8. "pick yellow_ball_1 room_1"
   - Precondition: We're in front of yellow_ball_1 in room_1, and our hands are empty. This is true after action 7.
   - Effect: We're now holding yellow_ball_1, our hands are not empty, and we're no longer in front of yellow_ball_1.

9. "gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3"
   - Precondition: We're in room_1, and yellow_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3. This is true after action 8.
   - Effect: We're now in front of yellow_door_1.

10. "toggle yellow_door_1"
   - Precondition: We're in front of yellow_door_1. This is true after action 9.
   - Effect: yellow_door_1 becomes unlocked.

11. "gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1"
   - Precondition: We're in room_1, room_3 is adjacent to room_1, and yellow_door_1 (which connects them) is unlocked. This is true after action 10.
   - Effect: We're now in room_3 and no longer in front of yellow_door_1.

12. "gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_3 room_4"
   - Precondition: We're in room_3, and yellow_door_2 connects room_3 and room_4. This is true after action 11.
   - Effect: We're now in front of yellow_door_2.

13. "toggle yellow_door_2"
   - Precondition: We're in front of yellow_door_2. This is true after action 12.
   - Effect: yellow_door_2 becomes unlocked.

Everything looks good, except for one potential issue. After action 8, we're holding yellow_ball_1. But the precondition for "toggle" doesn't say anything about our hands being empty or not. Let me check if there's anything in the problem statement that prevents us from toggling a door while holding an object...

The precondition for "toggle" is: "you may only toggle a door d if you are in front of d."

So it seems like we can toggle a door even if we're holding an object. This means our plan is valid. After steps 1-13, we'll have unlocked yellow_door_2, and we'll be in front of it. We'll also still be holding yellow_ball_1.

Let's finalize the plan:

1. "gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2" - Go in front of green_door_1 in room_4.
2. "toggle green_door_1" - Unlock green_door_1.
3. "gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_1" - Go to room_2 from room_4 using green_door_1.
4. "gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1" - Go in front of purple_door_1 in room_2.
5. "toggle purple_door_1" - Unlock purple_door_1.
6. "gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1" - Go to room_1 from room_2 using purple_door_1.
7. "gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_1" - Go in front of yellow_ball_1 in room_1.
8. "pick yellow_ball_1 room_1" - Pick up yellow_ball_1 in room_1.
9. "gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3" - Go in front of yellow_door_1 in room_1.
10. "toggle yellow_door_1" - Unlock yellow_door_1.
11. "gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1" - Go to room_3 from room_1 using yellow_door_1.
12. "gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_3 room_4" - Go in front of yellow_door_2 in room_3.
13. "toggle yellow_door_2" - Unlock yellow_door_2.

This plan satisfies all the constraints and achieves the goal of being in front of an unlocked yellow door. So, this is our solution.

Actually, on second thought, I just realized I have a syntax error. The "gotodoor" command should be "gotodoor d r1 r2". Let me rewrite the plan with the correct syntax:

1. "gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2" - Go in front of green_door_1 in room_4.
2. "toggle green_door_1" - Unlock green_door_1.
3. "gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_1" - Go to room_2 from room_4 using green_door_1.
4. "gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1" - Go in front of purple_door_1 in room_2.
5. "toggle purple_door_1" - Unlock purple_door_1.
6. "gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1" - Go to room_1 from room_2 using purple_door_1.
7. "gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_1" - Go in front of yellow_ball_1 in room_1.
8. "pick yellow_ball_1 room_1" - Pick up yellow_ball_1 in room_1.
9. "gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3" - Go in front of yellow_door_1 in room_1.
10. "toggle yellow_door_1" - Unlock yellow_door_1.
11. "gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1" - Go to room_3 from room_1 using yellow_door_1.
12. "gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_3 room_4" - Go in front of yellow_door_2 in room_3.
13. "toggle yellow_door_2" - Unlock yellow_door_2.

Still seems good!
