Okay, let's see. I need to solve this planning problem where the goal is to have a yellow door connecting room_2 and room_4, be in front of it, and have it unlocked. Also, there's a constraint that at some point I must be in front of the purple_box_1, which is in room_2. Let me start by understanding the initial state and the required actions.

First, the agent starts in room_1. The doors are all locked initially. The purple_box_1 is in room_2. The goal door has to be yellow, connect room_2 and room_4. Looking at the doors, yellow_door_1 connects room_2 and room_4. So the target door is yellow_door_1. The goal is to be in front of it, in room_2 or room_4, with it unlocked. Also, the plan must include being in front of purple_box_1 at least once.

So, the steps needed would involve getting to room_2 to reach the purple_box_1. But since all doors are locked, the agent needs to unlock doors to move between rooms. Let's see the initial doors: grey_door_1 connects room_1 and room_2, but it's locked. Similarly, blue_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3, also locked. So the agent can't leave room_1 initially unless they unlock a door. But to unlock a door (toggle), they need to be in front of it. But to get in front of a door, they need to be in a room connected by that door, and the position in front of the door isn't blocked. Wait, the preconditions for "gotodoor" are that you're in a room connected by the door and that there's no object blocking the position in front of the door in the current room.

So, in room_1, the doors are grey_door_1 (to room_2) and blue_door_1 (to room_3). The agent is in room_1. To go to the door, say grey_door_1, the agent would need to use "gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2". But first, is there any object blocking the door in room_1? The objects in room_1 are green_ball_1, green_ball_2, grey_ball_1, green_ball_3. But where are they placed? The problem states that objects may block doors if they are in front. But the initial state doesn't mention any door being blocked. So perhaps the doors are not blocked initially. So the agent can go to the door.

So the plan might be: go to grey_door_1 in room_1, toggle it (unlock), then go through to room_2. Once in room_2, they can go to the purple_box_1 (which is in room_2), satisfy the constraint. Then, proceed to unlock yellow_door_1, which connects room_2 and room_4, and be in front of it unlocked.

Wait, but yellow_door_1 is initially locked. So after getting to room_2, the agent needs to go to yellow_door_1 (which connects to room_4), unlock it, then be in front of it. But the agent needs to be in front of it when it's unlocked. Let's outline the steps step by step.

Initial location: room_1. All doors locked. Need to get to room_2. So first, go to grey_door_1 in room_1, toggle it (unlock), then go to room_2. Once in room_2, go to purple_box_1 (since it's in room_2). Then, from room_2, go to yellow_door_1 (which connects to room_4). Toggle it to unlock, then be in front of it. Then, the goal is achieved.

Wait, but the goal is to have a yellow door d (which is yellow_door_1) connecting room_2 and room_4, be in front of d, and d is unlocked. So after unlocking yellow_door_1, the agent needs to be in front of it. So after toggling, which would unlock it, they are already in front of it? Because to toggle, they need to be in front of it. So the steps would be:

1. In room_1, go to grey_door_1 (gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2)
2. Toggle grey_door_1 (unlocks it)
3. Gotoroom room_1 room_2 grey_door_1 (move to room_2)
4. Now in room_2, go to purple_box_1 (gotoobject purple_box_1 room_2) â€“ this satisfies the constraint
5. Then, go to yellow_door_1 (gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_4)
6. Toggle yellow_door_1 (unlocks it)
7. At this point, the agent is in front of yellow_door_1, which is yellow, connects room_2 and room_4, and is now unlocked. So that's the goal.

But wait, step 5: to go to yellow_door_1 in room_2, is there any object blocking it? The purple_box_1 is in room_2. If the purple_box_1 is blocking the door, then the agent can't go to the door. But the initial state says purple_box_1 is in room_2, but not that it's blocking a door. So unless the purple_box_1 is in front of the door, which the problem doesn't state. The problem's initial state doesn't mention any door being blocked by an object, so perhaps the doors are not blocked. So the agent can go to yellow_door_1 in room_2.

But when the agent is in room_2, after step 3, they can first go to the purple_box_1 (step 4), then go to the door. Then, toggle. So that should work.

But let's check the preconditions for each action.

First, starting in room_1.

Action 1: gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2. Preconditions: the agent is in a room connected by the door (yes, room_1), and no object is blocking the position in front of the door in room_1. Since no objects are blocking (as per initial state), this is allowed.

Then toggle grey_door_1. Precondition: must be in front of it. After gotodoor, the agent is in front of grey_door_1, so toggle is possible. Toggling unlocks it.

Then gotoroom room_1 room_2 grey_door_1. Preconditions: in room_1 (yes), adjacent to room_2 via grey_door_1, which is now unlocked. So possible. After this, the agent is in room_2, not in front of anything.

Then gotoobject purple_box_1 room_2. Since the agent is in room_2, and the box is there. So that's allowed. Now, the agent is in front of purple_box_1, satisfying the constraint.

Then, need to get to yellow_door_1. So gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_4. Preconditions: agent is in room_2 (yes), and no object is blocking the door's position. Since the purple_box_1 is in room_2 but maybe not blocking. So if the agent is in front of purple_box_1, after gotoobject, then moving to the door would require leaving that position. But how does movement work here? Wait, the actions like gotodoor, gotoobject, etc., move the agent to the front of the object or door. So after being in front of purple_box_1, the next action would be gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_4, which would move the agent to the door, provided that the door's position isn't blocked. But if the purple_box_1 isn't blocking the door, then this is possible. So assuming that, then the agent can go to the door.

Then toggle yellow_door_1. Since the agent is in front of it, this unlocks it. Now, the door is unlocked, and the agent is in front of it. So the goal is achieved.

So the plan would be:

1. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2
2. toggle grey_door_1
3. gotoroom room_1 room_2 grey_door_1
4. gotoobject purple_box_1 room_2
5. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_4
6. toggle yellow_door_1

That's six actions. Let's check if all preconditions are met.

Step 1: Agent in room_1, can go to grey_door_1 (door connecting room_1 and room_2). No blocking objects. Yes.

Step 2: Toggle grey_door_1. Agent is in front of it. Unlocks it. Now door is unlocked.

Step 3: Move to room_2. Door is unlocked, so allowed.

Step 4: Go to purple_box_1 in room_2. Agent is in room_2, box is there. So allowed. Now, constraint is met here.

Step 5: Go to yellow_door_1 in room_2. No blocking objects. Allowed.

Step 6: Toggle yellow_door_1. Since it's locked initially, toggling unlocks it. Now, the door is unlocked, and agent is in front. So the goal is achieved.

Is this the optimal plan? Let's see if there's a shorter path. Maybe combine some steps. But considering the necessary steps, unlocking two doors (grey_door_1 and yellow_door_1) requires two toggle actions. The constraint requires being in front of purple_box_1, which is in room_2. So you have to go to room_2, then go to the box. Then proceed to the door.

Alternatively, can the agent do something else? Let's see. Suppose after step 3 (in room_2), instead of going to the box first, can they go to the yellow door first, then toggle, but then how to satisfy the constraint? Because they need to be in front of the box at some point. So maybe after unlocking the yellow door, they can go back to the box. But that would add steps. The current plan includes the box in step 4, which is necessary. So this seems optimal.

Another point: when the agent is in room_2, after step 3, they are not holding any objects. So they can pick up the purple_box_1. But why would they need to? The constraint is just to be in front of it, not pick it up. So gotoobject is sufficient.

So the plan as above seems valid. Let me check each action again.

Action 1: gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2. Correct.

Action 2: toggle grey_door_1. Correct.

Action 3: gotoroom room_1 room_2 grey_door_1. Correct.

Action 4: gotoobject purple_box_1 room_2. Correct.

Action 5: gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_4. Correct.

Action 6: toggle yellow_door_1. Correct.

So that's six steps. Is there a way to make it shorter? For example, maybe combining some movements. Let's see. After step 3, the agent is in room_2. They need to go to the purple_box_1. Then go to the yellow door. But can they go directly from the box to the door? Yes, because after step 4, they are in front of the box. Then step 5 moves them to the door. That's allowed. Then toggle.

Another thought: when in room_2, after arriving via grey_door_1, is the agent in front of any object or door? No, because gotoroom action effects include no longer being in front of anything. So after step 3, they are in room_2, not in front of anything. So step 4 is required to go to the box.

Alternatively, can they go directly from room_2 to the yellow door without going to the box? Then they would have to go to the box later. But that would add steps. Let's see:

Alternative plan:

After step 3 (in room_2), go to the yellow door first, toggle, then go to the box. But then the toggle would unlock the door. But the goal requires the door to be unlocked and the agent in front. So if after unlocking, they are in front, then the goal is met. But the constraint is that they must be in front of the box at some point. So in this alternative, after unlocking the door, they would need to go to the box. But that would add steps. So the original plan is better.

So the original plan is six steps, which seems optimal. I don't see a way to do it in fewer steps. Each action is necessary. The steps are:

Unlock grey door, go to room2, go to box, go to yellow door, unlock it. So six steps.
