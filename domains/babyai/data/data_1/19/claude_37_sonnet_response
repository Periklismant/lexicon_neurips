Alright, let's break down the planning problem:

I need to find a plan where I am in front of a yellow door, which connects room_2 and room_4, and the door is unlocked. Additionally, I need to be in front of purple_box_1 at some point in the plan.

First, let's analyze what we're given and what we need to do:

Given:
- I start in room_1.
- Various balls and boxes are distributed across the rooms.
- All doors are initially locked.
- I need to unlock a yellow door connecting room_2 and room_4.
- I need to be in front of purple_box_1 at some point.

From the initial state, I know:
- purple_box_1 is in room_2.
- The yellow door that connects room_2 and room_4 is yellow_door_1.

So, my goal is:
1. Go to room_2 from room_1 using grey_door_1 (after unlocking it).
2. Go in front of purple_box_1 (to satisfy the constraint).
3. Go in front of yellow_door_1.
4. Unlock yellow_door_1.

Let's start planning:

1. I need to unlock grey_door_1 to go from room_1 to room_2.
2. To unlock grey_door_1, I need to go in front of it.
3. After unlocking grey_door_1, I need to go to room_2.
4. In room_2, I need to go in front of purple_box_1 (to satisfy the constraint).
5. Then, I need to go in front of yellow_door_1.
6. Finally, I need to unlock yellow_door_1.

Let's outline the plan:

1. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2
2. toggle grey_door_1
3. gotoroom room_1 room_2 grey_door_1
4. gotoobject purple_box_1 room_2
5. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_4
6. toggle yellow_door_1

Let me check if this plan satisfies all the given conditions:

After the 6 actions, the goal is achieved as:
- I am in front of yellow_door_1.
- yellow_door_1 is yellow (given in the initial state).
- yellow_door_1 connects room_2 and room_4 (given in the initial state).
- yellow_door_1 is unlocked (after the `toggle yellow_door_1` action).

The constraint is also satisfied as I am in front of purple_box_1 after the 4th action.

Let's see if I'm missing any considerations:

- Are there any other actions needed to achieve the goal? No, the plan seems sufficient.
- Are there any other constraints I haven't addressed? No, the given plan satisfies the given constraint.
- Are there any alternative routes that might be shorter? No, this seems like the optimal path.

I believe the outlined plan is valid and optimal. Let's write it out formally.

Actually, wait, let me double-check one thing. I just realized that I need to be careful about the order of rooms in the `gotodoor` actions.

In the initial state, it says "room_2 and room_1 are connected via grey_door_1". So, to ensure I'm using the action correctly, I should probably use:

gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2

This makes it clear I'm looking at the door that connects room_1 to room_2.

Similarly, for yellow_door_1, the initial state says "room_4 and room_2 are connected via yellow_door_1", so I should use:

gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_4

So, my refined plan is:

1. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2
2. toggle grey_door_1
3. gotoroom room_1 room_2 grey_door_1
4. gotoobject purple_box_1 room_2
5. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_4
6. toggle yellow_door_1

Actually, now I'm overthinking this. Let me look at the `gotodoor` action again:

"gotodoor d r1 r2": Go in front of door d, connecting room r1 to room r2.

The precondition for this action says:
"goto door": you may only go in front of a door d if (i) you are in a room which door d is connecting with another room, and (ii) there is no object blocking the position in front of d in the room you are currently in.

Based on this, I need to make sure that I am in a room that door d is connecting to. 

For the first action, since I am in room_1, and grey_door_1 connects room_1 and room_2, I can go to that door from room_1. 

For the fifth action, since I am in room_2 after the third action, and yellow_door_1 connects room_2 and room_4, I can go to that door from room_2.

So, the plan should work as outlined before:

1. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2
2. toggle grey_door_1
3. gotoroom room_1 room_2 grey_door_1
4. gotoobject purple_box_1 room_2
5. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_4
6. toggle yellow_door_1

Let me finalize by checking once more against the initial state, goal, and constraint:

- In the initial state, I am in room_1, all doors are locked, and purple_box_1 is in room_2.
- After the plan, I am in front of yellow_door_1 (connecting room_2 and room_4), and it is unlocked.
- At some point in the plan (after the 4th action), I am in front of purple_box_1, satisfying the constraint.

I believe this plan is correct and optimal. Let me write it out as the answer.

But wait, let me double check preconditions and effects of all the actions once more.

1. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2
   - Precondition: I am in room_1, and grey_door_1 connects room_1 with another room (room_2). There's no mention of any objects blocking the door.
   - Effect: I am now in front of grey_door_1.

2. toggle grey_door_1
   - Precondition: I am in front of grey_door_1.
   - Effect: grey_door_1 is now unlocked.

3. gotoroom room_1 room_2 grey_door_1
   - Precondition: I am in room_1, which is adjacent to room_2, and grey_door_1 (which connects room_1 and room_2) is unlocked.
   - Effect: I am now in room_2 and no longer in front of grey_door_1.

4. gotoobject purple_box_1 room_2
   - Precondition: I am in room_2 and purple_box_1 is in room_2.
   - Effect: I am now in front of purple_box_1.

5. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_4
   - Precondition: I am in room_2, and yellow_door_1 connects room_2 with another room (room_4). There's no mention of any objects blocking the door.
   - Effect: I am now in front of yellow_door_1.

6. toggle yellow_door_1
   - Precondition: I am in front of yellow_door_1.
   - Effect: yellow_door_1 is now unlocked.

All actions seem to have their preconditions met and their effects match the goal. I believe the plan is valid.

Actually, let's be really pedantic here and check each action against the specific preconditions given:

1. "goto object": you may only go in front of an object x if you are in the same room as x.
2. "goto empty": you may go in front of an empty position anytime.
3. "goto door": you may only go in front of a door d if (i) you are in a room which door d is connecting with another room, and (ii) there is no object blocking the position in front of d in the room you are currently in.
4. "goto room": you may only go in a room r if (i) you are currently in a room r0 that is adjacent to r, and (ii) the door that is connecting r0 and r is unlocked.
5. "pick": you may only pick up an object x if (i) you are in the same room as x, and (ii) you are currently not holding any object.
6. "drop": you may only drop an object x if (i) you are currently holding x, and (ii) the position in front of you is empty.
7. "toggle": you may only toggle a door d if you are in front of d.

Let's match each action with its precondition:

1. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2
   - Corresponds to precondition 3 (goto door). I am in room_1, which grey_door_1 is connecting with room_2. There's no mention of any objects blocking the door in the initial state. This seems valid.

2. toggle grey_door_1
   - Corresponds to precondition 7 (toggle). After the first action, I am in front of grey_door_1. This seems valid.

3. gotoroom room_1 room_2 grey_door_1
   - Corresponds to precondition 4 (goto room). I am in room_1, which is adjacent to room_2, and grey_door_1 (which connects room_1 and room_2) is unlocked after the toggle. This seems valid.

4. gotoobject purple_box_1 room_2
   - Corresponds to precondition 1 (goto object). After the third action, I am in room_2, and purple_box_1 is in room_2. This seems valid.

5. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_4
   - Corresponds to precondition 3 (goto door). After the fourth action, I am in room_2, and yellow_door_1 is connecting room_2 with room_4. There's no mention of any objects blocking the door. This seems valid.

6. toggle yellow_door_1
   - Corresponds to precondition 7 (toggle). After the fifth action, I am in front of yellow_door_1. This seems valid.

All the preconditions seem to be met for the actions in the plan. Now, let's check if the effects of the actions match our intermediate and final states:

1. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2
   - Effect: I am now in front of grey_door_1.

2. toggle grey_door_1
   - Effect: grey_door_1 is now unlocked.

3. gotoroom room_1 room_2 grey_door_1
   - Effect: I am now in room_2 and no longer in front of grey_door_1.

4. gotoobject purple_box_1 room_2
   - Effect: I am now in front of purple_box_1. (This meets the constraint that I need to be in front of purple_box_1 at some point.)

5. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_4
   - Effect: I am now in front of yellow_door_1 and no longer in front of purple_box_1.

6. toggle yellow_door_1
   - Effect: yellow_door_1 is now unlocked.

The final state after the plan is that I am in front of yellow_door_1 (a yellow door that connects room_2 and room_4), and it is unlocked. This matches the goal. Also, at some point in the plan, I was in front of purple_box_1, which meets the constraint.

I believe the plan is valid and optimal. Here's the final plan:

1. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2
2. toggle grey_door_1
3. gotoroom room_1 room_2 grey_door_1
4. gotoobject purple_box_1 room_2
5. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_4
6. toggle yellow_door_1

Note: I was overthinking the "gotodoor" action. The arguments are basically which door and which rooms it connects. As long as the door mentioned indeed connects the two rooms mentioned, the action is valid (if other preconditions are met).

Wait, let's double-check the `gotodoor` action description:

"gotodoor d r1 r2": Go in front of door d, connecting room r1 to room r2.

The precondition for this action says:
"goto door": you may only go in front of a door d if (i) you are in a room which door d is connecting with another room, and (ii) there is no object blocking the position in front of d in the room you are currently in.

Let's make sure I'm using this correctly for each `gotodoor` in the plan:
For the first action, `gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2`, the semantic meaning is "go in front of grey_door_1, which connects room_1 to room_2." The precondition requires that I'm in one of the rooms that grey_door_1 connects. Since I'm initially in room_1, and grey_door_1 connects room_1 and room_2, this is valid.

For the fifth action, `gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_4`, the semantic meaning is "go in front of yellow_door_1, which connects room_2 to room_4." The precondition requires that I'm in one of the rooms that yellow_door_1 connects. After the third action, I'm in room_2, and yellow_door_1 connects room_2 and room_4, so this is valid.

Alright, I believe the plan is valid now. Let's formalize it:

1. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2
2. toggle grey_door_1
3. gotoroom room_1 room_2 grey_door_1
4. gotoobject purple_box_1 room_2
5. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_4
6. toggle yellow_door_1

I believe this plan achieves the goal of being in front of an unlocked yellow door that connects room_2 and room_4. It also satisfies the constraint of being in front of purple_box_1 at some point in the plan.

Actually, I notice that there are three dots ```  at the top and bottom of the requested plan, so let me format the response accordingly.

```
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2
toggle grey_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_2 grey_door_1
gotoobject purple_box_1 room_2
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_4
toggle yellow_door_1
```
