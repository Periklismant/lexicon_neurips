Alright, let's first understand the planning problem and think through a solution step by step.

We have a 2D gridworld with 4 rooms arranged in a square formation:
- room_1 (north-west)
- room_2 (south-west)
- room_3 (north-east)
- room_4 (south-east)

The rooms are connected by 4 doors:
- green_door_1 connects room_1 and room_2
- green_door_2 connects room_1 and room_3
- blue_door_1 connects room_2 and room_4
- red_door_1 connects room_3 and room_4

All doors are initially locked.

We have various balls and a box in the gridworld:
- yellow_ball_1 is in room_1
- red_ball_1, purple_ball_1, green_ball_1 are in room_2
- yellow_ball_2 is in room_3
- red_ball_2, yellow_ball_3, yellow_box_1 are in room_4

We start in room_4, and our goal is to be in room_3, in front of a yellow ball.

There's an additional constraint: at some point, green_door_2 (which connects room_1 and room_3) must be unlocked.

There are two yellow balls: yellow_ball_1 in room_1 and yellow_ball_2 in room_3. Since our goal is to be in room_3 in front of a yellow ball, and yellow_ball_2 is already in room_3, it seems logical to go to room_3 and get in front of yellow_ball_2.

Let's think about how to navigate from room_4 (where we start) to room_3.

We have two possible paths:
1. room_4 -> room_2 -> room_1 -> room_3
2. room_4 -> room_3 directly

Since all doors are locked, we'll need to toggle each door we want to use. Let's choose the second path as it's shorter.

So, our plan would be:
1. Go to the red_door_1 in room_4.
2. Toggle red_door_1 to unlock it.
3. Go from room_4 to room_3 using red_door_1.

But there's a constraint that green_door_2 (connecting room_1 and room_3) must be unlocked at some point. This adds a complication. We need to make sure we unlock green_door_2 at some point in our plan.

Taking this into consideration, we might need to take the longer path:
1. room_4 -> room_2 -> room_1 -> room_3

Let's revisit the actions and their preconditions to flesh out the plan.

1. "gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_3": Go in front of red_door_1, which connects room_4 and room_3.
2. "toggle red_door_1": Unlock red_door_1.
3. "gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_1": Go from room_4 to room_3 using red_door_1.
4. "gotodoor green_door_2 room_3 room_1": Go in front of green_door_2, which connects room_3 and room_1.
5. "toggle green_door_2": Unlock green_door_2.
6. "gotoobject yellow_ball_2 room_3": Go in front of yellow_ball_2 in room_3.

Let's review this plan:
- We start in room_4.
- We unlock red_door_1 and go to room_3.
- In room_3, we unlock green_door_2 (to satisfy the constraint) but we don't actually go through it.
- Finally, we approach yellow_ball_2 in room_3.

Wait, let me double check if the above actions follow the preconditions correctly:

1. "gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_3": The precondition states, "you may only go in front of a door d if (i) you are in a room which door d is connecting with another room, and (ii) there is no object blocking the position in front of d in the room you are currently in." We're in room_4, and red_door_1 connects room_4 and room_3. There's no mention of an object blocking the door, so I assume it's not blocked. This action should be valid.

2. "toggle red_door_1": The precondition is, "you may only toggle a door d if you are in front of d." After action 1, we're in front of red_door_1, so this action is valid.

3. "gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_1": The precondition is, "you may only go in a room r if (i) you are currently in a room r0 that is adjacent to r, and (ii) the door that is connecting r0 and r is unlocked." We're in room_4, and after action 2, red_door_1 is unlocked. This action should be valid.

4. "gotodoor green_door_2 room_3 room_1": After action 3, we're in room_3, and green_door_2 connects room_3 and room_1. As with action 1, I assume the door is not blocked. This action should be valid.

5. "toggle green_door_2": After action 4, we're in front of green_door_2, so this action is valid.

6. "gotoobject yellow_ball_2 room_3": The precondition is "you may only go in front of an object x if you are in the same room as x." We're in room_3, and yellow_ball_2 is in room_3. This action is valid.

I believe this plan addresses the goal of being in room_3, in front of a yellow ball, while ensuring that green_door_2a is unlocked at some point. However, I'm uncertain if this is the most optimal plan in terms of the number of actions. Let's consider other possibilities:

Alternative approach: Start with yellow_ball_3 in room_4, bring it to room_3.

1. "gotoobject yellow_ball_3 room_4": Go in front of yellow_ball_3 in room_4.
2. "pick yellow_ball_3 room_4": Pick up yellow_ball_3.
3. "gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_3": Go in front of red_door_1.
4. "toggle red_door_1": Unlock red_door_1.
5. "gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_1": Go from room_4 to room_3 using red_door_1.
6. "gotoempty": Go in front of an empty position in room_3.
7. "drop yellow_ball_3 room_3": Drop yellow_ball_3 in room_3.
8. "gotodoor green_door_2 room_3 room_1": Go in front of green_door_2.
9. "toggle green_door_2": Unlock green_door_2.
10. "gotoobject yellow_ball_3 room_3": Go in front of yellow_ball_3 in room_3.

This approach requires 10 actions, which is more than the 6 actions from the first approach. So, the first approach seems more optimal.

Actually, I realized there's a potential issue with the first approach. If yellow_ball_2 is in the same position as green_door_2, I can't toggle green_door_2 because it's blocked. Since there's no explicit mention of this in the problem, I'll assume they're in different positions. If they are in the same position, I'd need a modified plan, like temporarily moving the ball.

Wait, I should double check how I am parsing the actions, e.g. does the "gotodoor" action use the door name, or the two connecting rooms?

"gotodoor d r1 r2": Go in front of door d, connecting room r1 to room r2.

So "gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_3" means "Go in front of red_door_1, which connects room_4 and room_3."

With that understanding, I'm confident in the first approach, and it's indeed the more optimal one. Let's restate it:

1. "gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_3": Go in front of red_door_1.
2. "toggle red_door_1": Unlock red_door_1.
3. "gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_1": Go from room_4 to room_3 using red_door_1.
4. "gotodoor green_door_2 room_3 room_1": Go in front of green_door_2.
5. "toggle green_door_2": Unlock green_door_2.
6. "gotoobject yellow_ball_2 room_3": Go in front of yellow_ball_2 in room_3.

I believe this plan addresses the goal and constraints optimally.

Actually, I realized I should check the order of arguments carefully. Let's review the action descriptions:

"gotoobject x r": Go in front of object x in room r.
"gotoempty": Go in front of an empty position of the room, which does not contain any object.
"gotodoor d r1 r2": Go in front of door d, connecting room r1 to room r2.
"gotoroom r1 r2 d": Go to room r2 from room r1 using door d.
"pick x r": Pick up object x in room r.
"drop x r": Drop object x in room r.
"toggle d": Unlock door d if is locked. Lock door d if is unlocked.

So, the action to go in front of a door is: "gotodoor d r1 r2". For "red_door_1", the connecting rooms are room_4 and room_3. So, the action would be: "gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_3".

Similarly, the action to go to another room is: "gotoroom r1 r2 d". For going from room_4 to room_3 using red_door_1, it would be: "gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_1".

Now, let's reconsider our plan:

1. "gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_3": Go in front of red_door_1, which connects room_4 and room_3.
2. "toggle red_door_1": Unlock red_door_1.
3. "gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_1": Go from room_4 to room_3 using red_door_1.
4. "gotodoor green_door_2 room_3 room_1": Go in front of green_door_2, which connects room_3 and room_1.
5. "toggle green_door_2": Unlock green_door_2.
6. "gotoobject yellow_ball_2 room_3": Go in front of yellow_ball_2 in room_3.

This looks correct to me. Let's add the three backticks, that's required at the top and bottom line of the plan:

```
gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_3
toggle red_door_1
gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_1
gotodoor green_door_2 room_3 room_1
toggle green_door_2
gotoobject yellow_ball_2 room_3
```

I believe this plan satisfies the goal and constraints and is optimal in terms of the number of actions.
