Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. So the goal is to have a yellow ball in room_3, be in room_3, and be in front of that ball. Also, at some point, green_door_2 must be unlocked. Let's start by understanding the initial state and the constraints.

The agent starts in room_4. The yellow balls are in room_1 (yellow_ball_1), room_3 (yellow_ball_2), and room_4 (yellow_ball_3). The goal requires a yellow ball in room_3. So maybe we can use the one already there (yellow_ball_2) or move another one there. But the agent has to end up in room_3 in front of a yellow ball. Let's see.

But first, doors. The initial state has all doors locked. The constraint is that green_door_2 must be unlocked at least once. Green_door_2 connects room_1 and room_3. So the agent needs to toggle that door. But how to get there?

The agent is in room_4. From room_4, the connected doors are blue_door_1 (to room_2) and red_door_1 (to room_3). Both are locked. So initially, the agent can't leave room_4 unless they unlock one of those doors. Wait, but to unlock a door, you need to be in front of it and toggle it. So the agent needs to go to the door in their current room, unlock it, then go through.

So, for example, if the agent goes to red_door_1 in room_4, toggles it (unlocking), then goes to room_3. But red_door_1 connects room_4 and room_3. Let's check:

In room_4, the doors are blue_door_1 (connects to room_2) and red_door_1 (connects to room_3). So agent is in room_4. To go to red_door_1, they need to do "gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_3". But first, check preconditions: they must be in a room connected by the door (yes, room_4 is connected to room_3 via red_door_1), and there's no object blocking the door in their current room (room_4). Are any objects blocking doors in room_4? Let's see the objects in room_4: red_ball_2, yellow_ball_3, yellow_box_1. Do any of them block a door? The problem description mentions that objects can block doors if they're in front of them. But in the initial state, the only door in room_4 is red_door_1 and blue_door_1. Are the objects in room_4 blocking these doors? The initial state doesn't say any objects are blocking doors. Wait, the 'effects' of the 'pick' action mention that if the object was blocking a door, it's no longer blocked. But the initial state doesn't mention any blocked doors. So perhaps initially, no doors are blocked by objects. So the agent can go to red_door_1 in room_4.

So plan steps could be:

1. gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_3
2. toggle red_door_1 (unlocks it)
3. gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_1 (now in room_3)
4. gotoobject yellow_ball_2 room_3 (since it's already there)
But then the agent is in front of yellow_ball_2 in room_3. That satisfies the goal. But wait, the goal is to have a yellow ball in room_3 (which yellow_ball_2 already is), the agent in room_3, and in front of it. So maybe that's the solution. However, the constraint requires that green_door_2 is unlocked at least once. But in this plan, green_door_2 (connecting room_1 and room_3) is never touched. So this plan doesn't meet the constraint. Therefore, the agent must somehow unlock green_door_2 during the process.

So the agent has to unlock green_door_2, but how? Green_door_2 is between room_1 and room_3. To toggle it, the agent needs to be in front of it. So the agent needs to get to either room_1 or room_3 and approach green_door_2. Since room_3 is part of the goal, maybe the agent can go to room_3 first via red_door_1, then go to green_door_2 in room_3, toggle it, then proceed.

Wait, but after unlocking red_door_1, the agent can go to room_3. Then in room_3, the doors are green_door_2 (to room_1) and red_door_1 (to room_4). So in room_3, the agent can go to green_door_2, but they need to go to the door. But green_door_2 is in room_3 connected to room_1. So "gotodoor green_door_2 room_3 room_1". The preconditions are that they are in a room connected by the door (yes, room_3 is connected via green_door_2 to room_1), and that there's no object blocking the position in front of the door in the current room (room_3). The objects in room_3 initially are yellow_ball_2. If that's not blocking the door, then they can go to the door.

So steps would be:

After entering room_3 via red_door_1 (steps 1-3 above), then:

4. gotodoor green_door_2 room_3 room_1
5. toggle green_door_2 (unlocking it)
Now the constraint is satisfied (green_door_2 is unlocked at least once). Then, the agent can proceed to the yellow_ball_2 in room_3.

But the agent is already in room_3. After toggling green_door_2, they are in front of it. Then they need to go to the yellow_ball_2. So:

6. gotoobject yellow_ball_2 room_3
Now the agent is in front of yellow_ball_2 in room_3. That meets the goal. But let's check the plan's steps:

1. gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_3
2. toggle red_door_1
3. gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_1 (now in room_3)
4. gotodoor green_door_2 room_3 room_1
5. toggle green_door_2 (unlock)
6. gotoobject yellow_ball_2 room_3

That's 6 actions. But is there a shorter way? Let's see.

Alternative approach: Maybe unlock green_door_2 by going through room_1. But how to get to room_1? From room_4, the agent would need to go to room_2 via blue_door_1, then to room_1 via green_door_1. But blue_door_1 is locked. So the agent would have to unlock blue_door_1 first. Let's see:

But that seems longer. Let's compare:

Option 1 (current plan): 6 steps.

Option 2: Maybe using the existing yellow_ball_2 in room_3, and just unlock green_door_2 along the way. So the steps would be:

1. Unlock red_door_1 (as before)
2. Go to room_3.
3. Go to green_door_2 in room_3, unlock it (toggle), then go to the ball. So that's the same as before.

So the plan would require 6 steps, which satisfies the constraints. But wait, maybe the toggle of green_door_2 is part of the steps. Let's verify.

Another thing: After step 3 (entering room_3), the agent is in room_3. To toggle green_door_2, they need to be in front of it. So step 4: gotodoor green_door_2 room_3 room_1. Then step 5: toggle. Then step 6: gotoobject yellow_ball_2. So yes, 6 steps. That meets the constraint because step 5 toggles green_door_2 from locked to unlocked. So that's valid.

Alternatively, if there's a way to do it in fewer steps. Let's think: Suppose after unlocking red_door_1 and going to room_3, the agent is in room_3. The yellow_ball_2 is there. So can they just go to the ball directly? But then they haven't unlocked green_door_2. So the constraint wouldn't be met. So they need to unlock green_door_2 at some point.

So the minimal steps would be 6 actions. Is there a way to combine some steps? For example, after toggling red_door_1, the agent is in front of it. Then they use gotoroom to go to room_3, which moves them into room_3. Then they need to go to green_door_2, toggle it, then go to the ball. So that's 6 steps.

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to toggle green_door_2 when in room_1. But getting to room_1 would require more steps. For example:

From room_4, unlock blue_door_1 (which connects room_4 to room_2), then go to room_2. Then unlock green_door_1 (connecting room_2 and room_1), go to room_1, then unlock green_door_2 (connecting room_1 and room_3). Then go to room_3. But that's more steps.

So the initial plan seems better.

Wait, but let's check if the agent can unlock green_door_2 from room_3. Yes, because green_door_2 is in room_3 connected to room_1. So the agent can go to green_door_2 in room_3, toggle it (unlocking), which satisfies the constraint. Then proceed to the ball.

So the plan is:

1. gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_3
2. toggle red_door_1 (now unlocked)
3. gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_1 (now in room_3)
4. gotodoor green_door_2 room_3 room_1
5. toggle green_door_2 (unlocking, meeting the constraint)
6. gotoobject yellow_ball_2 room_3

This should work. Let's check each step's preconditions.

Step 1: goto red_door_1 in room_4. Since agent is in room_4 and the door connects room_4 and room_3, and no object is blocking the door in room_4, this is allowed.

Step 2: toggle red_door_1. The agent is in front of it, so allowed. Now door is unlocked.

Step 3: go to room_3. Since door is unlocked, allowed. Agent is now in room_3, not in front of anything.

Step 4: go to green_door_2 in room_3. The door connects room_3 to room_1. Agent is in room_3, and no object is blocking the door in room_3. So allowed.

Step 5: toggle green_door_2. Now green_door_2 is unlocked. This satisfies the constraint.

Step 6: go to yellow_ball_2 in room_3. Agent is in the same room, so allowed. Now, agent is in front of the yellow ball in room_3, which meets the goal.

So this plan is valid and meets the constraints with 6 steps.

Is there a shorter plan? Let's see. For example, can the agent toggle green_door_2 while in room_3 without needing to go to it? No, because to toggle a door, you must be in front of it. So the steps are necessary.

Alternatively, what if the agent picks up the yellow_ball_3 in room_4, takes it to room_3, and drops it there. But that would require more steps. Let's see:

1. gotoobject yellow_ball_3 room_4
2. pick yellow_ball_3 room_4
3. gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_3
4. toggle red_door_1
5. gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_1
6. drop yellow_ball_3 room_3
7. gotoobject yellow_ball_3 room_3
But then we also need to unlock green_door_2, which adds steps. This approach would take more steps than the previous plan, so not optimal.

So the initial plan of 6 steps is better.

Another check: the goal requires that "you are in front of v" where v is a yellow ball in room_3. The initial plan puts the agent in front of yellow_ball_2, which is already in room_3, so that works.

Therefore, the optimal plan is the 6-step plan outlined earlier.
