Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. So, the goal is to get a green box (which is green_box_1) into room_3, be in room_3, and be in front of it. Also, there's a constraint that at some point, I must be holding both red_box_1 and another object. Hmm, but wait, red_box_1 is initially in room_4. Let me see.

First, the initial state: I'm in room_1. The green_box_1 is already in room_3. Wait, the problem says "there is a box v such that..." and the conditions are that v is green, in room_3, me in room_3, and in front of it. So if green_box_1 is already in room_3, maybe I just need to go there and be in front of it. But the constraints require that at some point, I'm holding red_box_1 and another object. So even if the green box is already in place, I have to do something with red_box_1 and another object.

Wait, the goal is about the green box being in room_3. Since it's already there, maybe the main task is to be in room_3 and in front of it. But how do the constraints affect this?

Constraints: At least once, I must be holding red_box_1 and another object. So I need to pick up red_box_1 and another object. But since I can only carry one object at a time, this seems impossible. Wait, the action "pick" requires that I'm not holding any object. So how can I hold two objects? Unless the constraint is that in some state, I have red_box_1 and some other object, but since I can't hold two, maybe it's a mistake. Wait, the constraint says "you are holding red_box_1", "you are holding some object". Wait, "some object" here could be any object, but if I'm holding red_box_1, then "some object" would be another one? But that's impossible because the agent can't hold two objects. So maybe the constraint is that in some state, I'm holding red_box_1 and in another state, I'm holding some other object. But the way it's written is "all true" for both conditions. So that's a problem. Wait, perhaps the constraint is that there exists a state where both conditions hold: holding red_box_1 and holding some object. But since you can't hold two, this seems impossible. Unless the "some object" includes red_box_1 itself. But "holding some object" is true when you're holding any object, including red_box_1. So maybe if I'm holding red_box_1, then both conditions are true. Because "you are holding red_box_1" is true, and "you are holding some object" is also true because red_box_1 is an object. So the constraint is satisfied if at any point I'm holding red_box_1. Because that satisfies both conditions. Wait, but the problem states "the following conditions are all true: you are holding red_box_1, you are holding some object". So if I'm holding red_box_1, then "you are holding some object" is true. So the constraint is that there's a state where I'm holding red_box_1. That's possible. So the plan must include picking up red_box_1 at some point.

So the steps needed: get to room_3, be in front of green_box_1, and ensure that during the plan, I pick up red_box_1. But how do I get to room_3?

Looking at the doors. The initial doors are all locked. So I need to unlock them. Let's see the doors:

room_1 is connected to room_2 via red_door_1 (locked), and to room_3 via purple_door_1 (locked). Room_2 connects to room_4 via purple_door_2 (locked). Room_3 connects to room_4 via yellow_door_1 (locked). All doors are locked.

So to move from room_1 to room_3, I need to unlock purple_door_1. To do that, I need to be in front of it and toggle it. But to get in front of purple_door_1, I need to be in a room connected by that door, which is room_1 or room_3. Since I'm in room_1, I can go to the door. But the goto_door action requires that there's no object blocking the position in front of the door in the current room. In room_1, there's purple_box_1. If purple_box_1 is blocking the door, then I can't go to the door. Wait, the problem's initial state doesn't mention any objects blocking doors. Wait, the preconditions for "goto door" include (ii) there's no object blocking the position in front of d in the current room. The initial state doesn't state that any objects are blocking doors, so maybe they are not. So I can go to the door.

So steps:

1. In room_1, go to purple_door_1 (connecting room_1 and room_3).

But first, I need to check if I can go to the door. Since the initial room is room_1, and purple_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3, I can go to it.

So:

Action: gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_3

Then toggle it to unlock.

Action: toggle purple_door_1

Now, purple_door_1 is unlocked. Then, go to room_3 via purple_door_1.

Action: gotoroom room_1 room_3 purple_door_1

Now, I'm in room_3. The green_box_1 is here. So I need to go in front of it. So:

Action: gotoobject green_box_1 room_3

But wait, the problem's goal is that I'm in room_3 and in front of green_box_1, which is already in room_3. So that's the last step.

But I also need to satisfy the constraint: at some point, I'm holding red_box_1. So in the plan, I must pick up red_box_1. But red_box_1 is in room_4. To get there, I need to unlock other doors.

Let's think. To reach room_4 from room_3, the door is yellow_door_1 (connects room_3 and room_4). But it's locked. So I need to unlock it. But to do that, I need to be in front of it. So from room_3, goto door yellow_door_1, toggle it, then go to room_4.

But wait, room_4 also has purple_door_2 connecting to room_2. Let's see.

But the path from room_3 to room_4: yellow_door_1. So once in room_3, I can go to yellow_door_1 (if not blocked). Then toggle to unlock, then go to room_4.

Once in room_4, red_box_1 is there. So pick it up.

But how to get back to room_3 afterward?

But maybe after picking up red_box_1, I can drop it somewhere else, but the constraint just requires that at some point I'm holding it, so maybe just pick it up and then proceed.

But let's outline the steps:

Current steps after being in room_3:

From room_3, need to go to room_4 to get red_box_1.

But first, unlock yellow_door_1:

In room_3:

- gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_4

- toggle yellow_door_1 (unlock)

- gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_1

Now in room_4. Then, go to red_box_1:

- gotoobject red_box_1 room_4

- pick red_box_1 room_4

This satisfies the constraint: when I pick red_box_1, I'm holding it. Then, I need to go back to room_3 and drop it somewhere, but the goal doesn't require moving the red box, just the green box being in room_3. Wait, the green box is already there. So the main goal is to be in room_3 in front of green_box_1. So after getting red_box_1, maybe I can drop it somewhere, but perhaps it's not necessary. However, after picking up red_box_1, I need to go back to room_3 to be in front of green_box_1.

But after picking red_box_1 in room_4, I need to return to room_3. Let's see:

From room_4, I can go back to room_3 via yellow_door_1 (which is now unlocked). So:

- gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_1

Then, in room_3, I can go to green_box_1:

- gotoobject green_box_1 room_3

Then drop red_box_1 if needed, but the goal is to be in front of green_box_1. But the drop action requires that I'm holding it and that the position in front is empty. But after picking up red_box_1, I need to drop it to have my hands free for any other actions? Wait, the goal doesn't require holding anything, just being in front of green_box_1. So maybe I can hold red_box_1 and then drop it in room_3.

But let's check the steps again.

But wait, the goal is to be in room_3, in front of green_box_1. The green_box_1 is already in room_3. So if I can get to room_3 and be in front of green_box_1, then that's the goal. But the constraint requires that I hold red_box_1 at some point.

So the plan could be:

1. In room_1, unlock purple_door_1, go to room_3.

2. Then, go to room_4 via yellow_door_1 (unlock it first), pick red_box_1.

3. Return to room_3, then go to green_box_1.

But during this, the step where I pick red_box_1 in room_4 satisfies the constraint.

But let's see the exact steps.

Let me outline:

Start in room_1.

1. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_3 (since in room_1, door connects to room_3)

2. toggle purple_door_1 (unlocks it)

3. gotoroom room_1 room_3 purple_door_1 (now in room_3)

4. Now, need to go to room_4. To do that, need to unlock yellow_door_1.

5. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_4 (from room_3)

6. toggle yellow_door_1 (unlock)

7. gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_1 (now in room_4)

8. gotoobject red_box_1 room_4

9. pick red_box_1 room_4 (now holding it, which satisfies the constraint)

10. Now, need to go back to room_3 to be in front of green_box_1.

11. gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_1 (back to room_3)

12. gotoobject green_box_1 room_3

Now, the agent is in room_3, in front of green_box_1, which is green and in room_3. So that's the goal. The constraint is satisfied when step 9 is executed.

But wait, when you pick red_box_1, you have to be in the same room as it. So step 8 and 9 are correct.

But wait, step 8: gotoobject red_box_1 room_4. Then step 9: pick red_box_1 room_4.

Yes, that's correct.

So the plan would be:

1. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_3

2. toggle purple_door_1

3. gotoroom room_1 room_3 purple_door_1

4. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_4

5. toggle yellow_door_1

6. gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_1

7. gotoobject red_box_1 room_4

8. pick red_box_1 room_4

9. gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_1

10. gotoobject green_box_1 room_3

But let's check if there are any objects blocking doors. For example, in room_1, there's purple_box_1. If purple_box_1 is blocking the purple_door_1, then gotodoor would not be possible. But the problem's initial state doesn't mention any objects blocking doors. So the initial assumption is that they are not blocking. So the actions are possible.

But wait, the problem's "effects" of pick include that if x was blocking a door, it's no longer blocking. So if the object was blocking a door, picking it up removes the block. But the initial state doesn't mention any objects blocking doors. So the initial positions of objects are not blocking any doors, so gotodoor actions are possible.

Thus, the plan above should work. But let's count the steps. The goal is to have an optimal (shortest) plan. Maybe there's a shorter way.

Alternative approach: After unlocking purple_door_1 and going to room_3, maybe instead of going to room_4, can we do something else to get red_box_1? But red_box_1 is in room_4. The only way is through room_2 and room_4 via purple_door_2, but that's locked. Let's see.

From room_1, the red_door_1 connects to room_2, which is locked. So if I can unlock red_door_1, then go to room_2, then unlock purple_door_2 to room_4, etc. But that might require more steps.

But comparing the two paths:

Option 1: room_1 -> room_3 -> room_4 via yellow door (requires unlocking two doors: purple_door_1 and yellow_door_1).

Option 2: room_1 -> room_2 via red_door_1 (needs to unlock red_door_1), then room_2 to room_4 via purple_door_2 (unlock that), then room_4 to room_3 via yellow_door_1 (unlock that). But this would require three doors to unlock, leading to more steps. So option 1 is better.

So the initial plan of unlocking purple_door_1 and yellow_door_1 is better.

But let's check if the doors' colors matter. The toggle action doesn't depend on color, just on being in front of the door.

So the initial plan is steps 1-10 as above. But let's check for possible optimizations.

Wait, after step 3, the agent is in room_3. To unlock yellow_door_1, steps 4 and 5 are needed. Then step 6 to room_4.

But maybe after unlocking purple_door_1, the agent can go to room_3, then directly go to the yellow door and unlock it. Then proceed.

Alternatively, can the agent go from room_3 to room_4 via yellow_door_1 once it's unlocked.

But the initial plan seems to be the minimal steps. Let me count:

Steps 1-10: 10 actions.

Is there a shorter way?

Let me think again. The goal is to be in room_3 in front of green_box_1. The green_box_1 is already in room_3. So the minimal steps would be: go to room_3, then go to green_box_1. But that would require unlocking purple_door_1. So steps:

1. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_3

2. toggle purple_door_1

3. gotoroom room_1 room_3 purple_door_1

4. gotoobject green_box_1 room_3

That's 4 steps. But this plan doesn't satisfy the constraint of holding red_box_1. So the agent needs to pick up red_box_1 at some point. So the agent must go to room_4 and pick it up. So the initial longer plan is required.

But maybe there's a way to unlock the doors more efficiently. For example, if the agent can go through room_4 via another door. Wait, room_2 connects to room_4 via purple_door_2. If the agent can unlock that door, but it's initially locked. So to get to room_2, need to unlock red_door_1. Let's compare.

Alternative plan:

1. In room_1, unlock red_door_1:

   a. gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_2

   b. toggle red_door_1

   c. gotoroom room_1 room_2 red_door_1

Now in room_2.

2. In room_2, unlock purple_door_2 (connects to room_4):

   a. gotodoor purple_door_2 room_2 room_4

   b. toggle purple_door_2

   c. gotoroom room_2 room_4 purple_door_2

Now in room_4.

3. In room_4, pick red_box_1:

   a. gotoobject red_box_1 room_4

   b. pick red_box_1 room_4 (satisfies constraint)

4. Then, go to room_3 via yellow_door_1. But yellow_door_1 is locked. So need to unlock it:

   a. From room_4, gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_3

   b. toggle yellow_door_1

   c. gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_1

5. Now in room_3, goto green_box_1:

   a. gotoobject green_box_1 room_3

This plan has:

Steps 1a-c (3 steps), 2a-c (3), 3a-b (2), 4a-c (3), 5a (1). Total 3+3+2+3+1=12 steps. Which is longer than the initial plan (10 steps). So the first plan is better.

Thus, the initial plan of 10 steps is better.

But wait, in the initial plan, steps are:

1. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_3

2. toggle

3. gotoroom to room_3

4. gotodoor yellow_door_1

5. toggle

6. gotoroom to room_4

7. gotoobject red_box_1

8. pick

9. gotoroom back to room_3

10. gotoobject green_box_1

Total of 10 steps.

But perhaps there's a way to optimize further.

Wait, after step 6, the agent is in room_4. Then steps 7 and 8 are necessary. Then step 9 back to room_3. Then step 10. But after step 9, the agent is in room_3. Then step 10 is needed.

Alternatively, after step 9, the agent is in room_3. They need to go to green_box_1. So step 10 is needed. Can't skip that.

Alternatively, after unlocking yellow_door_1 and going to room_4, can the agent pick up red_box_1 and then drop it somewhere else? No, because the goal doesn't require moving it. But the constraint is already satisfied when picked up.

Another thought: When the agent is in room_3 after returning from room_4 (step 9), they need to go to green_box_1. But what if they are already in front of it? No, because after entering room_3 from room_4, they are not in front of any object. So they need to gotoobject green_box_1.

So the initial plan seems necessary.

Thus, the steps as outlined should work and meet the constraints. Now, let's write them in the required format.
