Let me summarize the problem:

1. We have a 2D gridworld with 4 rooms arranged in a square formation.
2. There are objects (boxes and balls) and doors connecting the rooms.
3. We have a set of actions we can perform: goto object, goto empty, goto door, goto room, pick, drop, and toggle.
4. Each action has specific preconditions and effects.
5. We start in room_1, not holding any object, and all doors are locked.
6. Our goal is to be in room_3, in front of the green box (green_box_1), which should also be in room_3.
7. Additionally, we have a constraint that at some point, we must be holding the red box (red_box_1).

Let's think through this step by step:

Initially, we're in room_1 and the green box is in room_3. To reach it, we need to go from room_1 to room_3, which means we need to unlock the purple_door_1 connecting room_1 and room_3.

The constraint says that at some point, we need to be holding the red box (red_box_1). The red box is in room_4. So, we need to go to room_4, pick up the red box, and then at some point, drop it.

Let's plan a sequence of actions:

1. From room_1, we need to reach room_4 where the red box is. We can go through room_2 (using red_door_1) and then to room_4 (using purple_door_2). But first, we need to unlock these doors.
2. Go to the door connecting room_1 and room_2 (red_door_1).
3. Toggle the door to unlock it.
4. Go to room_2.
5. Go to the door connecting room_2 and room_4 (purple_door_2).
6. Toggle the door to unlock it.
7. Go to room_4.
8. Go to the red box.
9. Pick up the red box (this satisfies our constraint).
10. Now, we need to go back to room_3. We can go through the door connecting room_4 and room_3 (yellow_door_1). But first, we need to unlock it.
11. Go to the door connecting room_4 and room_3 (yellow_door_1).
12. Toggle the door to unlock it.
13. Go to room_3.
14. At this point, we need to drop the red box somewhere (since we'll need to pick up and drop the green box as required by the goal).
15. Go to an empty position.
16. Drop the red box.
17. Go to the green box.
18. We're now in front of the green box in room_3, which is our goal.

Wait, let me think more carefully. The goal is:
"There is a box v such that "The following conditions are all true: "v is green", "v is in room_3", "you are in room_3", "you are in front of v"""

This means we need to ensure that the green box is in room_3, we are in room_3, and we are in front of the green box. Initially, green_box_1 is in room_3, so it's already in the right room. So we mainly need to get to room_3 and position ourselves in front of green_box_1. But let's double-check: the green box is already in room_3, so we don't need to move it. We just need to ensure we're in room_3 and in front of it.

And the constraint is:
"The following expression must hold in at least one state: "The following conditions are all true: "you are holding red_box_1", "you are holding some object"""

This means that at some point during our plan, we need to be holding red_box_1.

Given this, a more concise plan would be:

1. From room_1, we need to find a way to room_3. We can go through red_door_1 to room_2, and then through purple_door_2 to room_4, and finally through yellow_door_1 to room_3. But first, we need to unlock these doors.
2. Go to red_door_1 connecting room_1 and room_2.
3. Toggle red_door_1 to unlock it.
4. Go to room_2.
5. Go to purple_door_2 connecting room_2 and room_4.
6. Toggle purple_door_2 to unlock it.
7. Go to room_4.
8. Go to red_box_1.
9. Pick up red_box_1 (satisfying our constraint).
10. Go to yellow_door_1 connecting room_4 and room_3.
11. Toggle yellow_door_1 to unlock it.
12. Go to room_3.
13. Go to an empty position.
14. Drop red_box_1.
15. Go to green_box_1.
16. Now we're in room_3, in front of green_box_1, which is also in room_3.

But actually, thinking about it some more: Can't I just go to room_3 through purple_door_1 directly instead of taking the long route? Let's revise the plan:

1. From room_1, I'll go to purple_door_1 connecting room_1 and room_3.
2. Toggle purple_door_1 to unlock it.
3. Go to room_3.
4. Go to green_box_1.

But then I haven't satisfied the constraint of holding red_box_1 at some point. So, I need to find a way to pick up red_box_1, which is in room_4.

Hmm, perhaps I can:
1. From room_1, go to purple_door_1.
2. Toggle purple_door_1 to unlock it.
3. Go to room_3.
4. Go to yellow_door_1 connecting room_3 and room_4.
5. Toggle yellow_door_1 to unlock it.
6. Go to room_4.
7. Go to red_box_1.
8. Pick up red_box_1 (satisfying our constraint).
9. Go back to room_3 (using yellow_door_1).
10. Go to an empty position.
11. Drop red_box_1.
12. Go to green_box_1.

This seems more efficient.

Let me now formalize the actions:

1. `gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_3` - Go to the door connecting room_1 and room_3.
2. `toggle purple_door_1` - Unlock the door.
3. `gotoroom room_1 room_3 purple_door_1` - Go from room_1 to room_3 using the now unlocked door.
4. `gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_4` - Go to the door connecting room_3 and room_4.
5. `toggle yellow_door_1` - Unlock the door.
6. `gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_1` - Go from room_3 to room_4 using the now unlocked door.
7. `gotoobject red_box_1 room_4` - Go to the red box in room_4.
8. `pick red_box_1 room_4` - Pick up the red box.
9. `gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_3` - Go to the door connecting room_4 and room_3.
10. `gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_1` - Go from room_4 to room_3 using the already unlocked door.
11. `gotoempty` - Go to an empty position in room_3.
12. `drop red_box_1 room_3` - Drop the red box in room_3.
13. `gotoobject green_box_1 room_3` - Go to the green box in room_3.

And there we are: in room_3, in front of green_box_1, which is also in room_3, and at some point during our plan, we held red_box_1.

Oh, but I just realize I didn't fully read the "goto room" action's effects:

"you are no longer in front of x0."

That means after moving from one room to another, I'm not in front of anything. If I'm not in front of anything, can I immediately "goto object" without first "goto empty"? Let me check the preconditions for "goto object":

"goto object": you may only go in front of an object x if you are in the same room as x.

Ah, I see - "goto object" only requires that you're in the same room as the object. It doesn't matter whether you're already in front of something else. So the plan above is still valid.

Let me double check if I'm missing any action effects or preconditions:

1. `gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_3` - precondition: I'm in room_1, which I am. Effect: I'm now in front of purple_door_1 and no longer in front of anything else.
2. `toggle purple_door_1` - precondition: I'm in front of purple_door_1, which I am after the previous action. Effect: purple_door_1 is now unlocked.
3. `gotoroom room_1 room_3 purple_door_1` - precondition: I'm in room_1, which I am, and purple_door_1 is unlocked, which it is after the previous action. Effect: I'm now in room_3 and I've visited room_3. I'm no longer in front of anything.
4. `gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_4` - precondition: I'm in room_3, which I am after the previous action. Effect: I'm now in front of yellow_door_1.
5. `toggle yellow_door_1` - precondition: I'm in front of yellow_door_1, which I am after the previous action. Effect: yellow_door_1 is now unlocked.
6. `gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_1` - precondition: I'm in room_3, which I am, and yellow_door_1 is unlocked, which it is after the previous action. Effect: I'm now in room_4 and I've visited room_4. I'm no longer in front of anything.
7. `gotoobject red_box_1 room_4` - precondition: I'm in room_4, which I am after the previous action. Effect: I'm now in front of red_box_1.
8. `pick red_box_1 room_4` - precondition: I'm in room_4 and in front of red_box_1, which I am after the previous action, and my hands are empty, which they are. Effect: I'm now holding red_box_1, my hands are no longer empty, and red_box_1 is no longer in room_4.
9. `gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_3` - precondition: I'm in room_4, which I am. Effect: I'm now in front of yellow_door_1.
10. `gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_1` - precondition: I'm in room_4, which I am, and yellow_door_1 is unlocked, which it is. Effect: I'm now in room_3. I'm no longer in front of anything.
11. `gotoempty` - precondition: None. Effect: I'm now in front of an empty position and no longer in front of anything else.
12. `drop red_box_1 room_3` - precondition: I'm holding red_box_1, which I am after action 8, and I'm in front of an empty position, which I am after action 11. Effect: I'm no longer holding red_box_1, my hands are now empty, red_box_1 is now in room_3, and I'm in front of red_box_1.
13. `gotoobject green_box_1 room_3` - precondition: I'm in room_3, which I am after action 10. Effect: I'm now in front of green_box_1 and no longer in front of red_box_1.

Everything looks good to me. But looking at the full action list more carefully, I don't think I need steps 11 and 12.

After step 10, I'm in room_3 and no longer in front of anything. I don't necessarily need to drop the red box. I can just go directly to the green box, so the final step would be:

11. `gotoobject green_box_1 room_3` - precondition: I'm in room_3, which I am after action 10. Effect: I'm now in front of green_box_1.

But let's re-read the goal one more time to be sure:
"There is a box v such that "The following conditions are all true: "v is green", "v is in room_3", "you are in room_3", "you are in front of v"""

We need:
1. The box is green (green_box_1 is green).
2. The box is in room_3 (green_box_1 is in room_3).
3. We are in room_3 (we'll be in room_3 after step 10).
4. We are in front of the box (we'll be in front of green_box_1 after step 11).

And the constraint:
"The following expression must hold in at least one state: "The following conditions are all true: "you are holding red_box_1", "you are holding some object"""

This will be satisfied after step 8, where we pick up red_box_1.

So the plan is:
1. `gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_3`
2. `toggle purple_door_1`
3. `gotoroom room_1 room_3 purple_door_1`
4. `gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_4`
5. `toggle yellow_door_1`
6. `gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_1`
7. `gotoobject red_box_1 room_4`
8. `pick red_box_1 room_4`
9. `gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_3`
10. `gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_1`
11. `gotoobject green_box_1 room_3`

But wait, I just realized there's a problem with this plan. In step 11, I try to go to green_box_1 in room_3, but I'm still holding red_box_1, so I can't pick up green_box_1. But the goal doesn't actually require me to pick up green_box_1, just to be in front of it. So, this plan should work.

However, I'm just realizing that I didn't fully read the "goto object" action's preconditions and effects. Let me double-check.

Precondition: "you may only go in front of an object x if you are in the same room as x."
Effect: "After performing this action regarding an object x, (i) if you were in front of some object or door x0, then you are no longer in front of x0 and (ii) you are in front of object x."

So after step 10, I'm in room_3 but not in front of anything, and green_box_1 is also in room_3. Thus, step 11 is valid and will place me in front of green_box_1. I am stil holiding red_box_1, but it's OK since the goal doesn't require me to pick up green_box_1, but just to be in front of it.

So now I get the final plan:
1. `gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_3`
2. `toggle purple_door_1`
3. `gotoroom room_1 room_3 purple_door_1`
4. `gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_4`
5. `toggle yellow_door_1`
6. `gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_1`
7. `gotoobject red_box_1 room_4`
8. `pick red_box_1 room_4`
9. `gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_3`
10. `gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_1`
11. `gotoobject green_box_1 room_3`

Let's double check one more time:
- We start in room_1.
- We navigate to room_3 via purple_door_1.
- We then navigate to room_4 via yellow_door_1.
- We pick up red_box_1 in room_4, satisfying our constraint.
- We go back to room_3.
- We go to green_box_1 in room_3.
- At this point, we are in room_3, in front of green_box_1, which is also in room_3. This satisfies our goal.

This looks good to me!

Wait actually, let me read the goal one more time:
"There is a box v such that "The following conditions are all true: "v is green", "v is in room_3", "you are in room_3", "you are in front of v"""

Ok, so the goal doesn't explicitly say that v = green_box_1. It just says that v is a green box in room_3, and we're in room_3 and in front of v. But since green_box_1 is the only green box in the world, and it's already in room_3, we can satisfy this goal by simply being in room_3 and in front of green_box_1. So the plan is correct.

Actually, let me make sure that in the final state, we're in room_3 and in front of a green box that's in room_3. Let's trace through our plan:
- We start in room_1.
- We navigate to room_3 via purple_door_1.
- We then navigate to room_4 via yellow_door_1.
- We pick up red_box_1 in room_4.
- We go back to room_3.
- We go to green_box_1 in room_3.
- Now, we're in room_3, in front of green_box_1, which is also in room_3.

So, the state is:
"you are in room_3"
"you are in front of green_box_1"
"green_box_1 is in room_3"
"green_box_1 is green"
"you are holding red_box_1"

This satisfies our goal.

Actually, let me check one more time to see if green_box_1 is in room_3. Green_box_1 is initially in room_3. At which subsequent step did we change its location?

The closest we came to changing its location was in step 11, where we go to green_box_1 in room_3. But this action only changes our position, not the position of green_box_1. So green_box_1 is still in room_3, which is what we need for our goal.

We're also holding red_box_1, but that's not a problem for our goal. The constraint required that we hold red_box_1 at some point during our plan, which we do (after step 8). So the plan is correct.

Final plan:
1. `gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_3`
2. `toggle purple_door_1`
3. `gotoroom room_1 room_3 purple_door_1`
4. `gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_4`
5. `toggle yellow_door_1`
6. `gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_1`
7. `gotoobject red_box_1 room_4`
8. `pick red_box_1 room_4`
9. `gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_3`
10. `gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_1`
11. `gotoobject green_box_1 room_3`

With this plan, we'll be in room_3, in front of green_box_1 (which is green and in room_3), and at some point during our plan, we held red_box_1. This satisifies both our goal and our constraint.
