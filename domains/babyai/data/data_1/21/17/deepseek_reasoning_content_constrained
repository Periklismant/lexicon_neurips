Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. The goal is to get to a situation where there's a red door (which is red_door_1) connecting room_2 and room_1, I'm in front of it, and it's unlocked. Also, there are constraints: at some point, red_door_1 must be unlocked, but before that, grey_door_1 must have been unlocked. 

Starting in room_2. The initial state says all doors are locked. So first, I need to unlock red_door_1, but to do that, I have to toggle it. But to toggle a door, I need to be in front of it. But to get in front of red_door_1, which connects room_1 and room_2, I have to be in either room_1 or room_2. Since I'm already in room_2, I can try to go to the door. However, the problem is that the preconditions for gotodoor require that there's no object blocking the position in front of the door in the current room. Wait, what's blocking the doors? The initial state doesn't mention any objects blocking doors, so maybe they're not blocked. Let me check the initial objects in each room.

In room_2, there's red_ball_1 and yellow_box_1. Are they blocking the doors? The problem statement mentions that objects may block doors, but the initial state doesn't say any are blocking. So maybe by default, doors are not blocked. So maybe I can go to red_door_1 from room_2. Let's see: Action "gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_1". Wait, the gotodoor action's syntax is "gotodoor d r1 r2", but the arguments are the door and the two rooms it connects. So since red_door_1 connects room_1 and room_2, from room_2, I can do gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_1. Then, once in front of it, I can toggle it. But wait, the door is initially locked. Toggling it would unlock it. So that would satisfy the first constraint of having red_door_1 unlocked at some state. But the second constraint says that if red_door_1 is unlocked in some state, there must have been an earlier state where grey_door_1 was unlocked. So I need to first unlock grey_door_1, then later unlock red_door_1.

But how do I get to grey_door_1? Grey_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3. But I'm starting in room_2. To get to room_1, I need to go through red_door_1, but that's locked. So that's a problem. Alternatively, is there another path? Let's look at the door connections. From room_2, the doors are red_door_1 (to room_1) and purple_door_1 (to room_4). But all doors are locked. So I can't go through any door initially. Hmm. Wait, but maybe I can unlock some door by toggling it if I can get in front of it. But to get in front of a door, I have to be in a room connected by that door, and there's no object blocking. So perhaps I need to first unlock a door that's accessible from my current room, but all doors from room_2 are locked. So maybe I need to pick up an object that can help me unlock a door? Wait, no, the toggle action just requires being in front of the door, regardless of color. Wait, the problem might be that I can't reach any door to toggle it because all doors are locked. But wait, the initial state says I'm in room_2, which is connected via red_door_1 to room_1 and via purple_door_1 to room_4. Both doors are locked, so I can't leave room_2 unless I unlock a door from within room_2. But to unlock a door, I need to be in front of it, which requires using gotodoor. But gotodoor's precondition is that the door connects the current room. So from room_2, I can go to red_door_1 (connecting room_2 to room_1) or purple_door_1 (connecting room_2 to room_4). But both are locked. Wait, but gotodoor doesn't require the door to be unlocked. Gotodoor just requires that you are in a room connected by the door and that the position in front of the door is not blocked. Once in front of the door, you can toggle it. So even if the door is locked, you can go in front of it and toggle (unlock) it.

So the plan could be: 

1. From room_2, go to red_door_1 (gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_1). But check if there's any object blocking that door in room_2. The initial state in room_2 has red_ball_1 and yellow_box_1. If either is blocking the door, then gotodoor would not be possible. But the problem statement doesn't mention any objects blocking doors initially, so maybe the doors are not blocked. So assuming that, then:

Action: gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_1

Then, toggle red_door_1, which would unlock it. But the constraint says that before red_door_1 is unlocked, grey_door_1 must have been unlocked. So this approach won't work. Because in this case, red_door_1 is unlocked first, violating the constraint that grey_door_1 must have been unlocked earlier.

So, the correct order is to first unlock grey_door_1, then unlock red_door_1. But how do I get to grey_door_1? Grey_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3. I'm in room_2. To get to room_1, I need to go through red_door_1, which is locked. To get to room_3, I would need to go through room_1 via grey_door_1 or through room_4 via purple and green doors. But all doors are locked. So this seems like a dead end. Wait, perhaps there's a way to reach grey_door_1 from another path. Let's see the connections:

room_1 is connected to room_2 (red_door_1) and room_3 (grey_door_1).

room_2 is connected to room_1 (red_door_1) and room_4 (purple_door_1).

room_3 is connected to room_1 (grey_door_1) and room_4 (green_door_1).

room_4 is connected to room_2 (purple_door_1) and room_3 (green_door_1).

But all doors are locked. So initially, the agent is stuck in room_2. The only doors are red_door_1 and purple_door_1, both locked.

Wait, but if I can't leave room_2, how can I unlock grey_door_1? Because grey_door_1 is between room_1 and room_3. Unless there's another way. Let me check the objects. Maybe there's a box that can be used to block or unblock a door? But the problem states that if an object is blocking a door, moving it would unblock. But the initial state doesn't mention any doors being blocked. So maybe all doors are unblocked. Therefore, perhaps the agent can go to the doors in their current room even if the door is locked. Because the gotodoor action's preconditions are:

(i) in a room connected by the door, and (ii) no object blocking the position in front of d in current room.

Assuming no objects are blocking, then the agent can go to the door. So from room_2, the agent can go to red_door_1, then toggle it (unlocking it). But the constraint says that before unlocking red_door_1, grey_door_1 must be unlocked. So the agent must first unlock grey_door_1, but how?

Wait, perhaps the agent can't directly reach grey_door_1 from room_2. So maybe there's a different path. Let's think again. The agent needs to unlock grey_door_1 before unlocking red_door_1. But grey_door_1 is in room_1 and room_3. So to get to grey_door_1, the agent needs to be in either room_1 or room_3. But the agent is in room_2. To get to room_1, the agent needs to unlock red_door_1 (since it's initially locked), but that would require unlocking red_door_1 first, which is not allowed per the constraint. So this seems impossible. Unless there's another way. Wait, maybe the agent can go through room_4. Let's see. From room_2, purple_door_1 connects to room_4. If the agent can unlock purple_door_1, then go to room_4, then from room_4, go to room_3 via green_door_1, unlock green_door_1, then go to room_3, and then from room_3, go to room_1 via grey_door_1. But all these doors are locked. So the agent would need to unlock them step by step.

But let's outline this possible path:

1. From room_2, go to purple_door_1 (room_2 and room_4). Gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_4.

2. Toggle purple_door_1 to unlock it.

3. Gotoroom room_2 room_4 purple_door_1. Now in room_4.

4. From room_4, go to green_door_1 (connects to room_3). Gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3.

5. Toggle green_door_1 to unlock it.

6. Gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1. Now in room_3.

7. In room_3, go to grey_door_1 (connects to room_1). Gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1.

8. Toggle grey_door_1 to unlock it.

9. Now, go back through green_door_1 to room_4, then to room_2 via purple_door_1, then to room_1 via red_door_1. Wait, but now that grey_door_1 is unlocked, can the agent go from room_3 to room_1 via grey_door_1? Then, in room_1, go to red_door_1, unlock it, then go back to room_2. Let's see:

After step 8, the agent is in room_3, in front of grey_door_1, which is now unlocked.

9. Gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1. Now in room_1.

10. Now, in room_1, go to red_door_1 (connecting to room_2). Gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_2.

11. Toggle red_door_1 to unlock it.

But the constraint is that red_door_1 must be unlocked only after grey_door_1 was unlocked. In this path, grey_door_1 is unlocked in step 8, and red_door_1 is unlocked in step 11. So that satisfies the constraint. Then, after unlocking red_door_1, the agent can go back to room_2 via red_door_1, and then be in front of red_door_1 (since the goal is to be in front of a red door connecting room_1 and room_2, which is red_door_1, and it's unlocked). So the final steps would be:

12. Gotoroom room_1 room_2 red_door_1 (now back in room_2).

13. Gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_1 (to be in front of it).

But after step 11, the agent is in front of red_door_1 in room_1. Wait, step 10: gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_2. Then step 11: toggle, unlocking it. Then step 12: gotoroom room_1 room_2 red_door_1. Now in room_2. Then step 13: gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_1. Then the agent is in front of red_door_1, which is now unlocked. That meets the goal.

But let's check the steps:

But how many actions does this take? Let's count:

1. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_4

2. toggle purple_door_1

3. gotoroom room_2 room_4 purple_door_1

4. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3

5. toggle green_door_1

6. gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1

7. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1

8. toggle grey_door_1

9. gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1

10. gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_2

11. toggle red_door_1

12. gotoroom room_1 room_2 red_door_1

13. gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_1

That's 13 steps. But maybe there's a shorter path. Let's think.

Alternatively, is there a way to unlock grey_door_1 without going through room_4? Let's see. The agent is in room_2. To get to grey_door_1, which is between room_1 and room_3. But to reach room_1, the agent needs to go through red_door_1, which is locked. So unless there's a way to unlock red_door_1 first, but that's against the constraint. So the path through room_4 seems necessary.

Another thought: perhaps the agent can use objects to block or unblock doors. For example, if the agent picks up an object that's blocking a door, but the initial state doesn't mention any blocked doors, so maybe that's not applicable here. Let's check the initial objects. In room_1, there's grey_box_1 and green_box_1. If they're in front of a door, that would block it. But the initial state doesn't say so. So perhaps doors are unblocked initially.

Another angle: the goal requires being in front of a red door connecting room_1 and room_2, which is red_door_1. So the agent needs to be in front of red_door_1, which is unlocked. So the plan must end with the agent in front of red_door_1, which is unlocked, and the constraint requires that grey_door_1 was unlocked earlier.

So the minimal steps would involve unlocking grey_door_1 first, then red_door_1. But how to reach grey_door_1? The path through room_4, room_3, then to room_1 via grey_door_1. So that's necessary.

But let's see if there's a way to do it with fewer steps. For example, maybe after unlocking purple_door_1 and green_door_1, the agent can go to room_3, unlock grey_door_1, then go back to room_1, unlock red_door_1.

Wait, let's retrace:

After step 8: grey_door_1 is unlocked. The agent is in room_3. Then, the agent can go through grey_door_1 to room_1 (step 9). Then in room_1, go to red_door_1 (step 10), toggle it (step 11), then go back to room_2 (step 12), then go to red_door_1 again (step 13). That's 13 steps.

Is there a way to avoid some steps? For example, after unlocking grey_door_1 and being in room_1, can the agent go to red_door_1 and unlock it immediately? Yes. So steps 1-11: that's 11 steps. Then step 12: gotoroom room_1 room_2 red_door_1 (now in room_2), and step 13: gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_1 (now in front of the door). So steps 13.

But maybe there's a more optimal path. Let's see.

Alternative plan:

1. From room_2, go to purple_door_1 (gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_4).

2. Toggle purple_door_1 (unlock).

3. Gotoroom room_2 room_4 purple_door_1.

4. From room_4, go to green_door_1 (gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3).

5. Toggle green_door_1 (unlock).

6. Gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1.

7. From room_3, go to grey_door_1 (gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1).

8. Toggle grey_door_1 (unlock).

9. Gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1.

10. Now in room_1. Go to red_door_1 (gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_2).

11. Toggle red_door_1 (unlock).

12. Now, the agent is in front of red_door_1 in room_1. To be in front of it in room_2, they need to go through the door. Wait, but the goal requires being in front of the door. The door connects room_1 and room_2. Being in front of it in either room is okay? Because the problem says "you are in front of d". So if the agent is in room_1 in front of red_door_1, that satisfies the condition. But the goal is "there is a door d such that... you are in front of d". So as long as d is red_door_1, and it's unlocked, then the agent can be in front of it in room_1 or room_2.

But the original goal is to have the agent in front of a red door connecting room_2 and room_1, which is red_door_1. So if the agent is in front of red_door_1 in room_1, that's acceptable. But the problem states "you are in front of d". So if after step 11, the agent is in front of red_door_1 in room_1, then that's the case. But then the door is unlocked, and the constraints are satisfied (grey_door_1 was unlocked in step 8). So maybe steps 1-11 are sufficient. Let me check:

Step 11: After toggling red_door_1, the agent is still in front of red_door_1 in room_1. So the conditions are met: red_door_1 is red, connects room_1 and room_2, the agent is in front of it, and it's now unlocked. So the goal is achieved. So the plan could end at step 11. That would be 11 actions, which is shorter. Let me verify:

1. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_4

2. toggle purple_door_1

3. gotoroom room_2 room_4 purple_door_1

4. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3

5. toggle green_door_1

6. gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1

7. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1

8. toggle grey_door_1

9. gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1

10. gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_2

11. toggle red_door_1

At this point, the agent is in front of red_door_1 in room_1. The door is now unlocked. The constraints require that "red_door_1 is not locked" in some state, which is true after step 11. Also, there must be an earlier state where grey_door_1 was unlocked (step 8). So this satisfies the constraints. The goal is to be in front of d (red_door_1), which is unlocked, and connecting room_1 and room_2. So yes, this meets the goal. Therefore, the plan can be 11 steps instead of 13.

So this plan would work. But need to check if all preconditions are met at each step.

Step 1: gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_4. Agent is in room_2. Purple_door_1 connects room_2 and room_4. No objects blocking in room_2 (assuming red_ball_1 and yellow_box_1 are not in front of the door). So allowed.

Step 2: toggle purple_door_1. Agent is in front of it, so allowed. Now purple_door_1 is unlocked.

Step 3: gotoroom room_2 room_4 purple_door_1. The door is now unlocked, so allowed. Now in room_4.

Step 4: gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3. Green_door_1 connects room_4 and room_3. Agent is in room_4. No objects blocking (initial state doesn't mention any). So allowed.

Step 5: toggle green_door_1. Now unlocked.

Step 6: gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1. Now in room_3.

Step 7: gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1. Agent is in room_3, grey_door_1 connects room_3 to room_1. No blocking objects. Allowed.

Step 8: toggle grey_door_1. Now unlocked.

Step 9: gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1. Now in room_1.

Step 10: gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_2. Agent is in room_1. Allowed.

Step 11: toggle red_door_1. Now unlocked. Now in front of red_door_1 in room_1. The goal is achieved.

Yes, this plan works. The final state meets all goal conditions and satisfies the constraints. The number of steps is 11. Can we make it shorter? Let's think.

Wait, after step 9, the agent is in room_1. The red_door_1 is in room_1. So steps 10 and 11 are needed to go to the door and toggle it. That's two steps. But perhaps there's a way to combine. But no, each action is separate. So this is minimal.

Therefore, the optimal plan should have 11 steps.
