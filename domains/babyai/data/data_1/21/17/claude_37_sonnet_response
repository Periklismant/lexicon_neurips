Let's understand the problem:

1. We're in a 2D gridworld with 4 rooms arranged in a square formation.
2. The rooms are connected by 4 doors (red_door_1, grey_door_1, purple_door_1, green_door_1).
3. There are various objects (boxes and balls) in the rooms.
4. We have a set of actions (goto, pick, drop, toggle) with preconditions and effects.
5. The goal is to be in front of red_door_1, which connects room_2 and room_1, and to make sure it's unlocked.
6. Additionally, we have two constraints:
   - red_door_1 should be unlocked in at least one state of the plan.
   - If red_door_1 is unlocked, then in an earlier state, grey_door_1 should have been unlocked.

Now, let's plan:

We start in room_2, and we need to be in front of red_door_1 when it's unlocked. red_door_1 connects room_2 and room_1.

Given the constraints, we need to:
1. First unlock grey_door_1 (which connects room_1 and room_3).
2. Then unlock red_door_1.

Let's trace the current state:
- We are in room_2.
- All doors are locked.
- grey_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3.
- red_door_1 connects room_1 and room_2.

We need to unlock grey_door_1 first, which means we need to be in front of it. grey_door_1 is between room_1 and room_3. Since we're in room_2, we need to go to room_1 or room_3 first. But all doors are locked, so we need to unlock a door to get to either room_1 or room_3.

Let's see which door connects our current room (room_2) to either room_1 or room_3:
- red_door_1 connects room_2 and room_1.
- purple_door_1 connects room_2 and room_4.

So, we can go to room_1 via red_door_1 or to room_4 via purple_door_1. Since grey_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3, it seems more direct to go to room_1.

However, there's a constraint: We need to unlock grey_door_1 before unlocking red_door_1. If we unlock red_door_1 now, we can't satisfy this constraint.

Let's revisit the room connections:
- room_1 and room_2 are connected via red_door_1.
- room_1 and room_3 are connected via grey_door_1.
- room_2 and room_4 are connected via purple_door_1.
- room_3 and room_4 are connected via green_door_1.

From room_2, we can go to:
- room_1 via red_door_1.
- room_4 via purple_door_1.

If we go to room_1, we can access grey_door_1. If we go to room_4, we can go to room_3 via green_door_1, and then access grey_door_1 from room_3.

Wait, there's a loop in our reasoning. We're trying to figure out how to get to a door, but all doors are locked, so we need to be in front of a door to unlock it. Let's revisit.

Actually, I think I understand. We need to be careful about the actions and their preconditions.

We can execute the "gotodoor" action to go in front of a door, and then the "toggle" action to unlock it. The "gotodoor" action lets us go in front of a door if we're in a room that the door connects to another room.

So, since we're in room_2, we can go in front of red_door_1 (which connects room_2 and room_1) or purple_door_1 (which connects room_2 and room_4). But given the constraint, we can't unlock red_door_1 before grey_door_1.

Let's plan the following route:
1. Go in front of purple_door_1 (which connects room_2 and room_4).
2. Toggle purple_door_1 to unlock it.
3. Go to room_4 from room_2 via purple_door_1.
4. Go in front of green_door_1 (which connects room_4 and room_3).
5. Toggle green_door_1 to unlock it.
6. Go to room_3 from room_4 via green_door_1.
7. Go in front of grey_door_1 (which connects room_3 and room_1).
8. Toggle grey_door_1 to unlock it. (This fulfills the constraint about grey_door_1 being unlocked before red_door_1.)
9. Go to room_1 from room_3 via grey_door_1.
10. Go in front of red_door_1 (which connects room_1 and room_2).
11. Toggle red_door_1 to unlock it. (This fulfills the constraint about red_door_1 being unlocked in at least one state.)
12. Go to room_2 from room_1 via red_door_1.
13. Go in front of red_door_1 (which connects room_2 and room_1).

Wait, the goal is to be in front of red_door_1 in room_2 when it's unlocked, not necessarily to be in room_2. Let's reconsider.

The goal is: "There is a door d such that "The following conditions are all true: "d is red", "room_2 and room_1 are connected via d", "you are in front of d", "d is not locked"""

So, we need to be in front of a red door that connects room_2 and room_1, and the door should be unlocked. From the initial state, the only red door is red_door_1, and it does connect room_2 and room_1.

Now, we're either in room_1 or room_2 when facing red_door_1. Let's go with the plan of ending up in room_2 (which is our starting room anyway).

With the constraints in mind:
1. Grey_door_1 should be unlocked at some point.
2. Grey_door_1 should be unlocked before red_door_1 is unlocked.

Here's the revised plan:
1. Go in front of purple_door_1 (which connects room_2 and room_4).
2. Toggle purple_door_1 to unlock it.
3. Go to room_4 from room_2 via purple_door_1.
4. Go in front of green_door_1 (which connects room_4 and room_3).
5. Toggle green_door_1 to unlock it.
6. Go to room_3 from room_4 via green_door_1.
7. Go in front of grey_door_1 (which connects room_3 and room_1).
8. Toggle grey_door_1 to unlock it. (This fulfills the constraint about grey_door_1 being unlocked before red_door_1.)
9. Go to room_1 from room_3 via grey_door_1.
10. Go in front of red_door_1 (which connects room_1 and room_2).
11. Toggle red_door_1 to unlock it. (This fulfills the constraint about red_door_1 being unlocked in at least one state.)
12. Go to room_2 from room_1 via red_door_1.
13. Go in front of red_door_1 (which connects room_2 and room_1).

This plan allows us to meet the goal (being in front of red_door_1, which connects room_2 and room_1, and is unlocked), and it also fulfills the constraints (grey_door_1 is unlocked before red_door_1, and red_door_1 is unlocked in at least one state).

Let's write out the action sequence:

```
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_4
toggle purple_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_4 purple_door_1
gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3
toggle green_door_1
gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1
toggle grey_door_1
gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1
gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_2
toggle red_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_2 red_door_1
gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_1
```

Wait, I just realized something. The goal state is a bit ambiguous. Let me reconsider it:

"There is a door d such that "The following conditions are all true: "d is red", "room_2 and room_1 are connected via d", "you are in front of d", "d is not locked"""

This seems to say:
1. There exists a door d that is red.
2. Room_2 and room_1 are connected via d.
3. You are in front of d.
4. d is not locked.

From the initial state, the only red door is red_door_1, and it connects room_2 and room_1. So, we need to be in front of red_door_1 when it's unlocked.

Now, the question is: should we be in room_2 or room_1 when we're in front of red_door_1?

Let's think about the gotodoor action. The action is "gotodoor d r1 r2", which means "Go in front of door d, connecting room r1 to room r2." This suggests that we need to specify which room we're in when we're in front of the door.

So, the action "gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_1" means we are in room_2 and we go in front of red_door_1 (which connects room_2 to room_1). Similarly, "gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_2" means we are in room_1 and we go in front of red_door_1 (which connects room_1 to room_2).

Given that we're looking for an optimal plan, and we start in room_2, it would be more efficient to end up in room_2 and be in front of red_door_1.

Let's stick with the revised plan:

```
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_4
toggle purple_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_4 purple_door_1
gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3
toggle green_door_1
gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1
toggle grey_door_1
gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1
gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_2
toggle red_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_2 red_door_1
gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_1
```

Wait, there's a more optimal way to do this. We're trying to end up in room_2, facing the red_door_1. Since we start in room_2, we don't have to go through all the rooms.

We can simply:
1. Go in front of red_door_1 (which connects room_2 and room_1).
2. Toggle red_door_1 to unlock it.
3. (Remain in front of red_door_1).

But this doesn't satisfy the constraints. We need grey_door_1 to be unlocked before red_door_1 is unlocked.

Looking back at this, actually there's an important constraint: the constraint says that "If expression "red_door_1 is not locked" holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: "grey_door_1 is not locked"". 

But we do need to be in front of a door to toggle it, so if we want to toggle grey_door_1, we must go to it first. Since grey_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3, we need to be in one of those rooms to toggle it. But all doors are locked initially, so we can't directly access room_1 or room_3.

We need to go through room_4:
1. Go in front of purple_door_1 (which connects room_2 and room_4).
2. Toggle purple_door_1 to unlock it.
3. Go to room_4 from room_2 via purple_door_1.
4. Go in front of green_door_1 (which connects room_4 and room_3).
5. Toggle green_door_1 to unlock it.
6. Go to room_3 from room_4 via green_door_1.
7. Go in front of grey_door_1 (which connects room_3 and room_1).
8. Toggle grey_door_1 to unlock it. (This fulfills the constraint about grey_door_1 being unlocked before red_door_1.)
9. Go back to room_2 via the route: room_3 -> room_4 -> room_2.
10. Go in front of red_door_1 (which connects room_2 and room_1).
11. Toggle red_door_1 to unlock it. (This fulfills the constraint about red_door_1 being unlocked in at least one state.)

So, the plan is:

```
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_4
toggle purple_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_4 purple_door_1
gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3
toggle green_door_1
gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1
toggle grey_door_1
gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_1
gotoroom room_4 room_2 purple_door_1
gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_1
toggle red_door_1
```

Actually, while revisiting the goal state, I'm having second thoughts. The reason is the constraint:

"If expression "red_door_1 is not locked" holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: "grey_door_1 is not locked""

This implies that grey_door_1 must be unlocked before red_door_1 is unlocked. It doesn't say that we need to end up with grey_door_1 unlocked. It just says that at some point, grey_door_1 should be unlocked, and that point should be before red_door_1 is unlocked.

In the plan I just proposed, we toggle grey_door_1 to unlock it and then toggle red_door_1 to unlock it. This satisfies the constraint.

But I think I'm overthinking this. Let's focus on the goal state again:

"There is a door d such that "The following conditions are all true: "d is red", "room_2 and room_1 are connected via d", "you are in front of d", "d is not locked"""

This means:
1. The door d is red.
2. Room_2 and room_1 are connected via d.
3. You are in front of d.
4. d is not locked.

From the initial state, the only red door is red_door_1, and it indeed connects room_2 and room_1. So, d is red_door_1. We need to be in front of red_door_1, and it should be unlocked.

Considering the constraint, grey_door_1 should be unlocked before red_door_1 is unlocked.

The final goal state is me standing in front of the red_door_1 when it's unlocked. Which room I'm in would determine which way I'm facing the door. Since I start in room_2, it would be more optimal to remain in room_2 and face towards room_1 through red_door_1. But the choice is not critical to the problem.

Let's go with the plan of ending in room_2, facing red_door_1:

```
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_4
toggle purple_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_4 purple_door_1
gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3
toggle green_door_1
gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1
toggle grey_door_1
gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_1
gotoroom room_4 room_2 purple_door_1
gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_1
toggle red_door_1
```

But wait, the goal is to be in front of the door, and the door should be unlocked. After toggling red_door_1, its state changes from locked to unlocked.

The goal state specifically says "you are in front of d" and "d is not locked". If the final state (the state after the last action) should meet both of these conditions, then we need to remain in front of red_door_1 and ensure it's unlocked.

With that understanding, the plan is:
```
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_4
toggle purple_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_4 purple_door_1
gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3
toggle green_door_1
gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1
toggle grey_door_1
gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_1
gotoroom room_4 room_2 purple_door_1
gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_1
toggle red_door_1
```

And I believe this plan fulfills all the goals and constraints. But let me check one more time.

The goal state is:
"There is a door d such that "The following conditions are all true: "d is red", "room_2 and room_1 are connected via d", "you are in front of d", "d is not locked"""

This means:
1. The door d is red. (red_door_1 is red)
2. Room_2 and room_1 are connected via d. (room_2 and room_1 are connected via red_door_1)
3. You are in front of d. (After the last action, we are in front of red_door_1)
4. d is not locked. (After toggling red_door_1, it's unlocked)

So, the goal conditions are satisfied.

The constraints are:
1. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: "red_door_1 is not locked"" (After toggling red_door_1, it's unlocked, so this constraint is satisfied.)
2. "If expression "red_door_1 is not locked" holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: "grey_door_1 is not locked"" (We unlock grey_door_1 before unlocking red_door_1, so this constraint is satisfied.)

Everything checks out. But there's one more thing. Do we need to toggle grey_door_1 back to lock it after we've unlocked it?

The constraints do not require that. The constraints only state that grey_door_1 should be unlocked at some point before red_door_1 is unlocked. There's no requirement that grey_door_1 should be locked again.

In fact, optimality is defined as the length of the plan. And since we're not explicitly required to re-lock grey_door_1, we should omit any such action for optimality. So we don't need to toggle grey_door_1 again.

So, the plan is:
```
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_4
toggle purple_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_4 purple_door_1
gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3
toggle green_door_1
gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1
toggle grey_door_1
gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_1
gotoroom room_4 room_2 purple_door_1
gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_1
toggle red_door_1
```

This plan does satisfy all the goals and constraints, with no need for additional actions.

Actually, I realized that this is actually a case where we can reach a shorter plan. Let me think.

Wait, I just reread the problem and let's double check. Room_1 is connected to room_2 via the red_door_1. So to reach the grey_door_1, which is between room_1 and room_3, we could go:
room_2 -> room_1 (via red_door_1) -> room_3 (via grey_door_1).

Rather than:
room_2 -> room_4 (via purple_door_1) -> room_3 (via green_door_1).

But if we took the first route, we'd have to unlock red_door_1 before grey_door_1, which would violate the constraint that grey_door_1 should be unlocked before red_door_1.

So, we need to take the longer route through room_4.

```
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_4
toggle purple_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_4 purple_door_1
gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3
toggle green_door_1
gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1
toggle grey_door_1
gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_1
gotoroom room_4 room_2 purple_door_1
gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_1
toggle red_door_1
```

Let me make one more check on this, because I want to make sure I understand the problem correctly. The goal is for me to be in front of the red door, the red door that connects room_1 and room_2, and for that door to be unlocked. 

The constraint is: if red_door_1 is unlocked in any state, then in an earlier state, grey_door_1 should have been unlocked. But we don't necessarily need to be in front of grey_door_1. 

Oh wait, I realize that there's a check in the validity of the plan. After toggling the door is it still considered to be "in front of" the door?

Let me go back to the question and check the action:

toggle: you may only toggle a door d if you are in front of d.
"toggle": After performing this action on a door d, (i) if d was locked, then it becomes unlocked, and (ii) if d was unlocked, then it becomes locked.

Ok, so yes, toggling a door does not have an effect on our position. So after toggling red_door_1, I am still in front of it. And the door is unlocked.

And then we're satisfying the optimal criteria as well, because we've done the minimal number of actions to reach a state in which I'm in front of the red door connecting room_1 and room_2, which is unlocked, and during some state before, the grey_door_1 was unlocked.

So the plan should be:
```
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_4
toggle purple_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_4 purple_door_1
gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3
toggle green_door_1
gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1
toggle grey_door_1
gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_1
gotoroom room_4 room_2 purple_door_1
gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_1
toggle red_door_1
```
