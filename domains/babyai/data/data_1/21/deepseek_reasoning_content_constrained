Okay, let me try to figure out how to solve this planning problem. So, the goal is to be in front of a blue door that's unlocked. The constraints are that blue_door_1 must be locked at some state, and if it's ever locked, then I must be holding an object either at that state or later.

First, let's recall the initial state. I'm in room_4. The doors are all locked initially. The blue_door_1 connects room_3 and room_4. So blue_door_1 is in room_4 and room_3, right? And it's blue. So that's the door we need to be in front of, unlocked.

But the goal is any blue door that's unlocked and in front of me. But the only blue door is blue_door_1. So the goal is to be in front of blue_door_1 when it's unlocked.

But the constraints: blue_door_1 must have been locked at some point. Since initially it's locked, maybe that's already satisfied. But wait, the initial state is that blue_door_1 is locked, so that condition is already met. But the second constraint is that if blue_door_1 is locked in any state, then I must be holding an object either at that state or after.

Wait, but in the initial state, blue_door_1 is locked, and I'm not holding anything. So that violates the constraint unless after that state, I hold an object. Because the constraint says that if in some state s, blue_door_1 is locked, then in s or some state after, I must be holding an object. So the initial state is s0 where blue_door_1 is locked, and in s0, I'm not holding anything. So I must hold an object in s0 or some state after s0. But since s0 is the initial state, I can't go back. So I need to ensure that after the initial state, at some point, I hold an object. So the plan must include picking up an object at some point after the initial state.

Wait, but maybe the initial state is considered, but the constraint is that if in any state s (including the initial) where blue_door_1 is locked, then in s or after, I must hold an object. So since the initial state has blue_door_1 locked and me not holding anything, I need to at some point after the initial state hold an object. So my plan must include picking up an object at least once.

So the steps I need to take:

1. Get to blue_door_1, unlock it, and be in front of it when it's unlocked.

But blue_door_1 is in room_3 and room_4. Since I'm starting in room_4, maybe I can go there. But first, I need to unlock it. To toggle a door, I need to be in front of it. But the doors are locked initially, so I can't go through them. Wait, but the gotodoor action requires that the position in front of the door is not blocked. Are there any objects blocking the doors? Let me check the initial state. The objects in room_4 are purple_ball_1 and grey_ball_1. Are they blocking doors? The problem statement mentions that the 'pick' action effect includes that if x was blocking a door, it's no longer blocking. But in the initial state, the problem doesn't say any objects are blocking doors. So maybe the doors aren't blocked. So I can go to the door in room_4 (blue_door_1 connects room_4 and room_3). So in room_4, I can go to blue_door_1. Then toggle it to unlock. But wait, the toggle action toggles the state. So if it's locked, toggle makes it unlocked. But after that, I need to make sure that blue_door_1 is not locked in the final state. So I need to toggle it once.

But here's the problem: the initial state has blue_door_1 locked, so toggling it would unlock it. But then, the goal is to have it unlocked and be in front of it. So the plan could be:

1. gotoempty (to get in front of an empty spot, but not sure if necessary)
Wait, but to perform gotodoor, I need to be in the same room as the door. Since I'm in room_4 and blue_door_1 connects room_4 and room_3, I can go to blue_door_1 from room_4. So:

Action: gotodoor blue_door_1 room_4 room_3

But wait, the gotodoor action's preconditions: I must be in a room connected by the door, and no object is blocking the position in front of the door. Assuming no objects are blocking, then I can go to the door.

So:

1. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_4 room_3

Then toggle it:

2. toggle blue_door_1

But after toggling, it's unlocked. Then the goal is to be in front of a blue door that's not locked. So I need to be in front of blue_door_1 after it's unlocked. But after toggling, I'm already in front of it. So the final state would meet the goal. However, let me check the effects. After toggle, the door is unlocked. Then the goal is that I am in front of it and it's unlocked. So the plan would be:

gotodoor blue_door_1 room_4 room_3
toggle blue_door_1

But wait, after the toggle action, the door is unlocked. So the goal is achieved. But let's check the constraints.

First constraint: blue_door_1 must be locked in at least one state. Since it starts locked (initial state), that's satisfied. The second constraint: if in any state s where blue_door_1 is locked, then in s or after, I must hold an object. The initial state s0 has blue_door_1 locked and me not holding anything. So I need to hold an object at some state after s0.

But in the above plan, I never pick up any object. So that violates the constraint. Therefore, the plan is invalid.

Therefore, I need to pick up an object at some point after the initial state.

So, I need to adjust the plan to include picking up an object.

Let's see: starting in room_4. Objects in room_4 are purple_ball_1 and grey_ball_1. So I can pick up one of them. But to pick up an object, I need to be in front of it.

So steps:

1. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4
2. pick purple_ball_1 room_4
3. Then proceed to unlock the door.

But after picking up, I need to drop it somewhere? Or just hold it while unlocking.

Wait, the constraint says that whenever blue_door_1 is locked, I must be holding an object in that state or after. The initial state is s0 where blue_door_1 is locked. So in s0, I'm not holding anything. Therefore, after s0, I need to hold an object at least once. So if I pick up an object in room_4, then in the state after that, I'm holding it. Then even if I drop it later, as long as in some state after s0, I held the object, the constraint is satisfied.

But the problem is that the initial state has blue_door_1 locked. So the constraint requires that in any state where blue_door_1 is locked, I must be holding an object in that state or later. Since in the initial state, blue_door_1 is locked and I'm not holding, then in some state after, I must hold an object. So as long as I pick up an object at some point, that's okay.

But in the plan where I just pick up an object and then unlock the door, perhaps that's enough.

So let's think:

1. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4
2. pick purple_ball_1 room_4 (now holding it)
3. drop purple_ball_1 room_4 (but why? Maybe not necessary. Alternatively, after picking, go to door, but can I hold the object while moving?)

Wait, when you perform a goto action, you can be holding an object. The preconditions for goto actions don't require your hands to be empty. Only the pick and drop actions have that. So after picking up, I can carry the object while moving.

So possible plan:

1. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4
2. pick purple_ball_1 room_4 (now holding it)
3. gotoempty (to get out of front of the ball)
4. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_4 room_3 (now in front of the door)
5. toggle blue_door_1 (unlock it)

Now, the final state is being in front of blue_door_1, which is unlocked. Also, during the plan, after the initial state, in step 2, I'm holding the ball. So the constraint is satisfied because in the initial state, blue_door_1 is locked, and after that, I hold the ball. So the second constraint is met.

But wait, the initial state is s0. Then after step 1, s1: in front of purple_ball_1. Step 2: pick, so in s2, holding it. Then steps 3-5. So in s0, blue_door_1 is locked, and in s0, I'm not holding anything. But since in s2 and beyond, I'm holding the object (until I drop it), the constraint is satisfied because in any state where blue_door_1 is locked (s0, s1, s2, s3, s4), after s0, there is a state (s2 onwards) where I'm holding the object.

But wait, after step 5, the door is unlocked. So in the final state, the door is unlocked. But the constraint requires that in any state where blue_door_1 is locked, I hold an object in that state or later. Since the door is only locked in s0-s4 (until step 5), and after s2, I'm holding the object. So for all those states where it's locked (s0-s4), in s2 and beyond, I'm holding the object. So that satisfies the constraint.

But wait, after step 5, when I toggle the door, it's unlocked. So from s5 onwards, the door is unlocked. So the constraint is satisfied because in all states where the door is locked (s0-s4), there's a subsequent state where I'm holding the object.

So this plan seems to meet the constraints.

But let's check if the plan is valid:

1. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4: preconditions are that I'm in the same room as the object (room_4, yes), and that the position is not blocked. Assuming no objects are blocking, that's okay.

2. pick purple_ball_1 room_4: preconditions are in same room and not holding anything. After step 1, I'm in front of the ball. Pick requires being in front of it. Wait, the 'pick' action's precondition is that I'm in the same room as the object and not holding anything. But also, to pick, I must be in front of the object? Wait, the 'gotoobject' action puts me in front of the object. Then, to pick it up, I need to be in front of it. So yes.

So step 1: gotoobject puts me in front of purple_ball_1 in room_4.

Step 2: pick, which requires being in front of it and not holding anything. Correct.

Then step 3: gotoempty. That's allowed any time, just move to an empty spot.

Then step 4: gotodoor blue_door_1 room_4 room_3. Preconditions: I'm in room_4 (yes, after step 3), and the door connects to room_3. Also, no object is blocking the position in front of the door. Assuming that after step 3, I'm in an empty spot, but moving to the door's position. But when I gotoempty, I leave the front of the object. Then gotodoor would be allowed if the door's position is not blocked. Since the initial state doesn't mention any objects blocking doors, so that's okay.

Step 4: gotodoor blue_door_1 room_4 room_3: now in front of the door.

Step 5: toggle blue_door_1. Precondition is that I'm in front of it. Yes. So toggle unlocks it.

Then, after step 5, the door is unlocked, and I'm in front of it. So the goal is achieved.

But wait, in the final state, I need to be in front of a blue door that's not locked. The toggle action in step 5 makes blue_door_1 unlocked, and I'm in front of it. So yes.

But the problem is that in step 3, after picking up the ball, I have to drop it somewhere? Or can I just carry it? Because the drop action requires that the position in front of me is empty. But in step 3, I do gotoempty, which moves me to an empty position. Then in step 4, I go to the door. Then step 5, toggle.

But I can carry the ball through all these steps. The only issue is that when I use gotoroom (but I'm not using that here). So holding the ball is allowed.

So the plan is:

gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4
pick purple_ball_1 room_4
gotoempty
gotodoor blue_door_1 room_4 room_3
toggle blue_door_1

But wait, after step 5, the door is unlocked, and I'm in front of it. So the goal is satisfied.

But let's check the constraints again:

1. blue_door_1 is locked in at least one state: yes, initial state.

2. Whenever blue_door_1 is locked, I must hold an object in that state or after. In the initial state, blue_door_1 is locked, and I'm not holding. But after that, I pick up the ball in step 2, so all subsequent states after step 2, I'm holding the ball until I drop it. However, in step 5, when I toggle the door, I'm still holding the ball. So all states from step 2 onward, I'm holding the ball. Therefore, in any state where blue_door_1 is locked (initial and steps 1-4), in the same state or after, I'm holding the ball. Because after step 2, I'm holding it. So the initial state is s0, but the holding starts at s2. So for s0 (blue_door_1 locked and not holding), is there a state after s0 where I hold? Yes, s2. So the constraint is satisfied.

But wait, the constraint says that if in state s, blue_door_1 is locked, then in s or after, I must hold an object. For s0, blue_door_1 is locked, and in s0, I don't hold. But in s2 and after, I do hold. So s0's condition is satisfied because after s0, there's s2 where I hold.

Similarly, in s1 (after gotoobject), blue_door_1 is still locked (since no action has toggled it yet). So in s1, the door is locked. Then, since in s2 I hold the object, that satisfies the constraint for s1.

In s2, door is locked (until step 5). So s2's condition is satisfied because in s2, I'm holding.

Same for s3 and s4 (after gotoempty and gotodoor). So the constraints are satisfied.

Therefore, this plan should work.

But let me check the actions again:

gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4: correct.

pick purple_ball_1 room_4: correct.

gotoempty: moves to an empty spot, required for gotodoor?

Wait, after picking up the ball, I'm no longer in front of it (effect of pick is that you are no longer in front of x). So after step 2, I'm not in front of anything. Then, gotoempty is allowed, but maybe unnecessary. Alternatively, after picking, can I directly go to the door? Let me see.

After step 2: I'm not in front of anything. So I can directly do gotodoor blue_door_1 room_4 room_3, without needing to gotoempty first.

Wait, the gotodoor action requires that the position in front of the door is not blocked. But in the initial state, no objects are blocking doors. So maybe step 3 is unnecessary.

So revised plan:

1. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4
2. pick purple_ball_1 room_4
3. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_4 room_3
4. toggle blue_door_1

Is that possible? Let's check:

After step 2, I'm holding the ball and not in front of anything. Then step 3: gotodoor. Preconditions: in room_4 (yes), door connects room_4 to room_3 (yes), and no object is blocking the door's front. Since the ball was picked up, maybe the door's front was blocked by the ball? Wait, the problem statement doesn't mention any objects blocking doors initially. So the initial state doesn't have any objects blocking doors. So even after picking up the ball, the door's front is still not blocked. So step 3 is possible.

So the plan becomes:

gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4
pick purple_ball_1 room_4
gotodoor blue_door_1 room_4 room_3
toggle blue_door_1

This is shorter and meets all constraints.

But let's verify:

After step 2, I'm holding the ball, which satisfies the constraint that after the initial state (s0), I hold an object.

Then step 3: goto door, which is allowed.

Step 4: toggle, which unlocks the door.

Final state: in front of blue_door_1, which is unlocked. Goal achieved.

Constraints:

- blue_door_1 was locked in s0 (initial) → satisfies first constraint.

- For every state where blue_door_1 is locked (s0, s1, s2, s3), in s3 (before toggle), blue_door_1 is still locked. But since after s2, I'm holding the ball (from s2 onwards), all states after s2 have me holding the ball. So in s3 (gotodoor), blue_door_1 is locked, but I'm holding the ball. So the constraint is satisfied.

Therefore, this shorter plan is valid and optimal.
