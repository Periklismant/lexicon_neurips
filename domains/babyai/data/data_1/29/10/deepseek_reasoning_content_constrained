Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. So, the goal is to be in front of the grey door (grey_door_1) connecting room_3 and room_4, with it unlocked. And there's a constraint that if grey_door_1 is unlocked at any point, I must have been holding an object before that. Also, the initial state has all doors locked, and I'm in room_4.

First, the grey_door_1 connects room_3 and room_4. Since I'm starting in room_4, maybe I can go directly to that door. But the door is locked. To unlock it, I need to toggle it, which requires being in front of it. But the problem is, if I try to go to the door from room_4, but the door is locked. Wait, the "gotodoor" action's precondition says I can go in front of door d if I'm in a room connected by d, and there's no object blocking the position in front of d. Are there any objects blocking grey_door_1 in room_4? Let's check the initial state. In room_4, there's green_ball_1 and purple_box_2. But do these objects block the door? The problem description doesn't mention initial blockages except maybe objects in front of doors. Wait, the "goto door" action's precondition says there's no object blocking the position in front of d in the current room. So unless an object is placed in front of the door, which isn't specified here, maybe I can go to the door.

Wait, the initial state doesn't mention any objects blocking doors. So perhaps I can go to grey_door_1 from room_4. Let me try:

1. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3. But wait, the door is locked. Then, I can toggle it to unlock. But the constraint is that if I unlock grey_door_1, I must have held an object before. So I need to pick up an object, then drop it somewhere, then unlock the door. Wait, but how?

Let me outline the steps. The goal is to be in front of grey_door_1 when it's unlocked. So steps would be:

- Get to grey_door_1 in room_4.
- Toggle it to unlock. But to do that, I need to be in front of it. But before that, according to the constraint, if the door is unlocked (after toggle), I must have held an object previously. So I need to have held an object before unlocking the door.

So the plan would involve:

1. Pick up an object in room_4. The available objects here are green_ball_1 and purple_box_2. Let's say I pick green_ball_1.

But to pick it, I need to be in front of it. So I have to gotoobject green_ball_1 room_4, then pick it. Then drop it somewhere else. Then go to the door, toggle it, and then be in front of it while it's unlocked.

Wait, but after dropping the object, I can proceed. Let's try:

- Start in room_4.

1. gotoobject green_ball_1 room_4. Precondition: I'm in room_4, which I am. Then pick it up.

2. pick green_ball_1 room_4. Now holding it.

3. drop green_ball_1 room_4. But wait, drop requires being in front of an empty position. So after picking, I'm no longer in front of the object. Wait, after pick, the effect is that I'm no longer in front of the object. So after picking, I need to gotoempty to drop. Or maybe after picking, I can just drop if I'm in front of an empty spot. Hmm, the drop action's precondition is that I'm holding x and the position in front is empty. Wait, but after picking, I'm not in front of anything. Wait, when you pick, you are no longer in front of the object. So to drop, you need to be in front of an empty position. So maybe after picking, I need to gotoempty, then drop.

Wait, the 'drop' action requires that the position in front of me is empty. So after picking, I might not be in front of anything, but to drop, I have to be in front of an empty spot. So perhaps:

1. gotoobject green_ball_1 room_4.

2. pick green_ball_1 room_4. Now holding it.

3. gotoempty (in room_4). Now in front of an empty spot.

4. drop green_ball_1 room_4. Now the object is back in room_4, but I've held it. Then, the constraint is satisfied because at some point I was holding an object.

Then, proceed to the door.

5. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3. Now in front of the door.

6. toggle grey_door_1. Since it was locked, this unlocks it. Now, the door is unlocked.

But the goal requires that I am in front of the door and it's not locked. So after step 6, I'm in front of the door and it's unlocked. So that's the goal. But wait, after toggle, the door is unlocked, and I'm in front of it. So steps 5 and 6 would achieve the goal. But we need to check the constraints.

The constraint says that if grey_door_1 is not locked in some state, there must be an earlier state where I was holding an object. In this plan, step 2-4 involve holding and dropping the green_ball_1. So step 6 (unlocking) comes after step 4, so the constraint is satisfied.

But wait, in this plan, after dropping the ball, the door is still locked. Then when I toggle, it becomes unlocked. So the state after step 6 has the door unlocked, and the earlier state (steps 2-4) where I was holding the object satisfies the constraint.

So this plan would work. Let's check each step's preconditions.

Initial state: in room_4, not holding anything.

1. gotoobject green_ball_1 room_4: possible, since I'm in room_4.

2. pick green_ball_1 room_4: preconditions met (in same room, not holding anything).

3. gotoempty: possible anytime. Now in front of empty spot.

4. drop green_ball_1 room_4: holding it, and in front of empty spot. So yes.

5. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3: possible because I'm in room_4, which is connected via grey_door_1, and no object is blocking the door's front (since we just dropped the ball elsewhere? Or maybe the drop action's effect places the ball in the room, but not necessarily blocking the door. Unless the 'drop' action puts the object in front of me, which could be the empty spot. Wait, the 'drop' effect says that after dropping, you are in front of x. So when you drop, you are now in front of the object. So after step 4, I'm in front of green_ball_1 again. Wait, the 'drop' action's effect is (i) you are no longer carrying x, (ii) you are in front of x, (iii) hands empty, (iv) x is in the current room. So after step 4, I'm in front of green_ball_1. Then, step 5 is gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3. But to perform gotodoor, I need to be in a room connected by the door (yes, room_4 and room_3 via grey_door_1), and there's no object blocking the position in front of d in my current room. But after step 4, I'm in front of green_ball_1. So if the door's position is blocked by an object, then I can't go there. Wait, but the 'gotodoor' action requires that the position in front of the door is not blocked. If the green_ball_1 is not in front of the door, then it's okay. But in the initial state, the objects in room_4 are green_ball_1 and purple_box_2. Where are they located? The problem doesn't specify their positions relative to doors, so unless they are blocking the door, which isn't stated, the gotodoor action is possible. Assuming that the initial positions of objects are not blocking the doors, then step 5 is possible. Then after step 5, I'm in front of grey_door_1. Then step 6: toggle. Now the door is unlocked.

So the final state is: in front of grey_door_1, which is unlocked, and in room_4. Wait, the goal is to be in front of d (grey_door_1) and d is not locked. But after step 6, the door is unlocked, and I'm in front of it. So that satisfies the goal. Also, the constraint is met because I held the green_ball_1 in step 2-4.

But wait, the problem's goal is "There is a door d such that d is grey, connects room_3 and room_4, you are in front of d, and d is not locked." So grey_door_1 is the only grey door, connecting room_3 and room_4. So yes. So the plan seems valid.

But let's check the order. Let me write the steps again:

1. gotoobject green_ball_1 room_4
2. pick green_ball_1 room_4
3. gotoempty (now in front of empty spot)
4. drop green_ball_1 room_4 (now in front of it again)
5. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3
6. toggle grey_door_1

Wait, but after step 4, dropping the green_ball_1 puts me in front of it. So if the green_ball_1 is now in front of me, does that block the door? If the position where I dropped it is in front of the door, then when I try to go to the door (step 5), the position in front of the door is blocked. But the problem doesn't specify where the objects are located. Since the initial positions are not given, we have to assume that when you drop an object, it's placed in the room, but not necessarily blocking a door unless you drop it in front of the door.

Wait, the 'drop' action's effect is that the object is situated in the current room. The position in front of you is where you drop it. So if after step 4, I'm in front of green_ball_1, which is now in room_4. But if I then try to go to the door, I need to check if the path is blocked. The 'gotodoor' action requires that the position in front of the door in the current room is not blocked. But if I'm dropping the ball in some other position, not in front of the door, then it's okay. So maybe after dropping, the ball is in a different spot, not blocking the door. So the gotodoor action can proceed.

But how do I ensure that the drop doesn't block the door? The 'gotoempty' action takes me to an empty position, which could be anywhere in the room. So when I drop the ball, it's placed in that empty position. Assuming that the empty position isn't in front of the door, then the door's front remains unblocked. But since the problem doesn't specify the layout of the rooms or positions, we have to assume that the 'gotoempty' action takes me to a spot that's not blocking any door, as per the problem's allowance. So the plan is valid.

Alternatively, maybe after dropping the ball, I can go to the door. But the key point is that as long as the door's front isn't blocked, the gotodoor action is possible.

Therefore, the plan seems valid. Let me check the steps again:

- After dropping the ball, I need to go to the door. Since the door is in room_4, and assuming that the door's front is not blocked, then gotodoor is possible.

So the steps would be:

1. gotoobject green_ball_1 room_4
2. pick green_ball_1 room_4
3. gotoempty
4. drop green_ball_1 room_4
5. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3
6. toggle grey_door_1

This should satisfy all conditions. The goal is achieved in step 6, where I'm in front of the grey door (grey_door_1), which is now unlocked. The constraint is satisfied because I held the green_ball_1 in step 2-4, which was before unlocking the door in step 6.

Is there a shorter plan? Let's see. Suppose I don't need to drop the object. Can I pick it up, carry it to the door, then toggle? But the problem says that the door must be unlocked, and when I toggle it, I must have held an object before.

Wait, if I pick up the object, then go to the door, then toggle. Then, during the toggle action, the door is unlocked. The constraint is that if the door is unlocked in some state, there's an earlier state where I was holding an object. In this case, the toggle action would unlock the door, and the holding of the object was before the toggle. So maybe:

1. gotoobject green_ball_1 room4
2. pick it
3. gotodoor grey_door_1 room4 room3 (but can I do this while holding the ball?)
Yes, because gotodoor's preconditions don't require you to not be holding anything. So if I'm holding the ball, I can go to the door as long as the door's front is unblocked. Then, toggle the door (which requires being in front of it). Then, drop the ball somewhere else.

But this would satisfy the constraint, because when I toggle the door (unlocking it), I was holding the ball earlier (steps 2-3). Then, after unlocking, I can drop the ball. But the goal just requires being in front of the unlocked door. So after step 3, I'm at the door, holding the ball. Then step 4: toggle. Now the door is unlocked, and I'm in front of it. Then, I can drop the ball (but the goal is already achieved). So the plan would be:

1. gotoobject green_ball_1 room4
2. pick green_ball_1 room4
3. gotodoor grey_door_1 room4 room3
4. toggle grey_door_1
5. (drop if needed, but goal is already met)

Wait, after step 4, the door is unlocked, and I'm in front of it. So that's the goal. Then, step 4 is the last action. So the plan would be shorter. But does step 3 require that the door's front is not blocked? Yes. But in this case, since I'm holding the ball, but the door's front is not blocked (assuming that the ball was not blocking it initially). So steps:

1. gotoobject green_ball_1 room_4
2. pick green_ball_1 room_4
3. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3 (possible if door's front is not blocked)
4. toggle grey_door_1 (now unlocked)
5. (no need to drop; the goal is met at step 4)

This plan is shorter. So why didn't I think of that earlier? Because I thought that after picking up the ball, I have to drop it, but the constraint only requires that if the door is unlocked, there was a prior state where I held an object. In this plan, steps 2-4: holding the ball until step 4, then toggling. So when the door becomes unlocked (step 4), the earlier state (steps 2-3) where I was holding the ball satisfies the constraint.

Wait, but in this plan, when I toggle the door (step 4), I'm still holding the ball. So the constraint is that if the door is not locked in some state, then there's an earlier state where I was holding. The state after step 4 has the door unlocked, and the earlier state (steps 2-3) where I was holding the ball. So the constraint is satisfied.

But then, this plan is shorter (4 steps instead of 6). So why would the first plan be longer? Because I assumed I had to drop the ball first. But the constraint doesn't require dropping the object, just that when the door is unlocked, there was a prior state where I was holding. So in this shorter plan, during step 4, the door is unlocked, and prior steps (2-3) involve holding. So this meets the constraint.

So this would be a better plan. Let's check the preconditions again.

Step 1: gotoobject green_ball_1 room4: correct.

Step 2: pick: yes, holding now.

Step 3: gotodoor grey_door_1 room4 room3. Preconditions: in room4 (yes), door connects room4 and room3 (grey_door_1 does), and no object is blocking the door's front in room4. Since we picked the green_ball_1, and assuming that the door's front wasn't blocked by another object (like purple_box_2), then this is possible. The initial state has purple_box_2 in room4. If purple_box_2 is blocking the door, then gotodoor would not be possible. But the problem doesn't state that any objects are blocking doors initially. So assuming that the door's front is unblocked, step 3 is possible.

Step 4: toggle grey_door_1: yes, since I'm in front of it.

After step 4, the door is unlocked, and I'm in front of it. So the goal is achieved. Also, the constraint is satisfied because step 2 was holding the ball before step 4.

This plan is shorter (4 steps) and valid. So this is the optimal plan.

So the final steps would be:

gotoobject green_ball_1 room_4
pick green_ball_1 room_4
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3
toggle grey_door_1

That's four actions, which is shorter than the previous plan. Therefore, this is the optimal plan.
