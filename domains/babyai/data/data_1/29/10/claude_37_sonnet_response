Let's break down the problem:

I need to navigate through a 2D gridworld with 4 rooms. The rooms are connected by 4 doors, and each room may contain boxes and balls.

My goal is to bring about a situation where:
"There is a door d such that "The following conditions are all true: "d is grey", "room_3 and room_4 are connected via d", "you are in front of d", "d is not locked""

In other words, I need to be in front of the unlocked grey door that connects room_3 and room_4.

Constraints:
1. The grey door (grey_door_1) must be unlocked at some point.
2. Before grey_door_1 is unlocked, I must be holding some object.

Initial state:
- I am in room_4.
- The objects are distributed across the rooms.
- All doors are locked.

Available actions:
- gotoobject: Go in front of an object.
- gotoempty: Go in front of an empty position.
- gotodoor: Go in front of a door.
- gotoroom: Move to another room through a door.
- pick: Pick up an object.
- drop: Drop the held object.
- toggle: Lock/unlock a door.

Now, let's plan:

1. First, I need to pick up some object.
   - I'm in room_4, and green_ball_1 and purple_box_2 are in room_4.
   - I can either pick up green_ball_1 or purple_box_2.

2. Then, I need to go to the grey door (grey_door_1) which connects room_3 and room_4.

3. I need to unlock the grey door.

4. Lastly, I need to be in front of the unlocked grey door.

Let's execute the plan step by step:

1. First, let's pick up an object. Since I'm in room_4, I'll pick up green_ball_1.
   - gotoobject green_ball_1 room_4
   - pick green_ball_1 room_4

2. Now, I need to go to the grey door (grey_door_1).
   - gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3

3. I need to unlock the grey door.
   - toggle grey_door_1

That's it. Now I should be in front of the unlocked grey door that connects room_3 and room_4, which satisfies the goal.

Let's check if this plan meets all the constraints:
1. The grey door (grey_door_1) is unlocked at some point (after the toggle action). ✓
2. Before grey_door_1 is unlocked, I was holding green_ball_1. ✓

So the final plan is:
```
gotoobject green_ball_1 room_4
pick green_ball_1 room_4
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3
toggle grey_door_1
```

Let me review the plan again to ensure it's optimal and satisfies all constraints.

With gotoobject, we go in front of the object green_ball_1.
With pick, we pick up the object.
With gotodoor, we go in front of the grey door connecting room_4 and room_3.
With toggle, we unlock the door.

This satisfies our goal: being in front of an unlocked grey door connecting room_3 and room_4.

And it also satisfies the constraints:
1. At some point, the grey door is unlocked.
2. Before unlocking the grey door, I was holding green_ball_1.

This plan is optimal, as it takes the minimum number of steps to achieve the goal. There's no need to drop the object or move to another room.

Actually, one thing to double check. Let me make sure I understand our goal. Our goal is to be in front of the unlocked grey door that connects room_3 and room_4. The grey door (grey_door_1) connects room_3 and room_4. After the toggle action, I'll have unlocked the door and will be standing in front of it. So, the goal is satisfied.

One thing to double check: am I in front of the door in the initial state? I don't think so, because the initial state doesn't say "you are in front of grey_door_1".

Actually, I'm pretty sure that the goal state is to be in front of an unlocked grey door, where the door connects room_3 and room_4. So, after picking up the object, going to the door, and unlocking it, I should be in the goal state.

Wait, there's another constraint: if the grey door is unlocked, then there must be an earlier state where I was holding some object. I'm holding green_ball_1 after the pick action, and the door is unlocked after the toggle action, so this constraint is satisfied.

Actually, let me be crystal clear about whether or not I drop the ball. I don't drop it and I'll still be holding it after the plan is completed, which is fine. The constraint only says that at some point before the door is unlocked, I must be holding some object.

Now let's think about whether I can optimize this plan further. I think this is optimal given the constraints. 

Let me systematically check the preconditions and effects of each action to ensure the plan is valid:

1. gotoobject green_ball_1 room_4
   Precondition: I am in room_4, green_ball_1 is in room_4. ✓
   Effect: I am in front of green_ball_1 in room_4. ✓

2. pick green_ball_1 room_4
   Precondition: I am in front of green_ball_1, I am not holding any object. ✓
   Effect: I am holding green_ball_1, I am no longer in front of green_ball_1. ✓

3. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3
   Precondition: I am in room_4, grey_door_1 connects room_4 and room_3, there's no object blocking the door. ✓
   Effect: I am in front of grey_door_1 in room_4. ✓

4. toggle grey_door_1
   Precondition: I am in front of grey_door_1. ✓
   Effect: grey_door_1 is unlocked. ✓

After these actions, I am in front of the unlocked grey door, which satisfies the goal. My final plan is:

```
gotoobject green_ball_1 room_4
pick green_ball_1 room_4
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3
toggle grey_door_1
```

Actually, I just realized that the gotodoor action has a precondition that there's no object blocking the door. I should verify there's no object blocking the grey door. The problem statement doesn't specify any objects blocking doors, so I assume there's no object blocking the grey door.  

In fact, i've triple checked the constraints and the plan, and everything still looks okay. I think our plan is optimal.

One last check. Let me review the goal statement once more.

Goal:
"There is a door d such that "The following conditions are all true: "d is grey", "room_3 and room_4 are connected via d", "you are in front of d", "d is not locked"""

After our plan, we should have:
- The door grey_door_1 is grey. ✓
- The door connects room_3 and room_4. ✓
- I am in front of grey_door_1. ✓
- grey_door_1 is unlocked. ✓

So, the goal is satisfied. And the plan is:

```
gotoobject green_ball_1 room_4
pick green_ball_1 room_4
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3
toggle grey_door_1
```

I believe this is the correct and optimal solution.

Actually, let me think once more about if I misunderstood something, because I wasn't told anything about objects blocking a door, but it's listed as a precondition for gotodoor.

The gotodoor action's precondition states that there should be no object blocking the position in front of the door. It doesn't say in the initial state description that any doors are blocked by objects, so I assume no doors are blocked initially. Also, considering that the objects  are in specific rooms, we would have been told if an object was blocking a specific door. So my reasoning for the absence of a "blocking" relation in the initial state seems correct.

Actually, one more thing: the definition of "toggle" means we can either lock or unlock a door. The toggle action makes a locked door unlocked, and an unlocked door locked. Initially, grey_door_1 is locked, so after toggling it, it becomes unlocked.

My plan is:
```
gotoobject green_ball_1 room_4
pick green_ball_1 room_4
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3
toggle grey_door_1
```

The plan seems straightforward and satisfies the goal and constraints. 

Let me double check the precondition of pick:

"pick": you may only pick up an object x if (i) you are in the same room as x, and (ii) you are currently not holding any object.

And the gotodoor precondition:

"goto door": you may only go in front of a door d if (i) you are in a room which door d is connecting with another room, and (ii) there is no object blocking the position in front of d in the room you are currently in.

Looks like I've satisfied these. I'm in the same room as the object, and not holding an object initially, so I can pick up the object. I'm in room_4, which is connected to room_3 by the grey door. As reasoned earlier, no object is blocking the door initially (no "blocking" relation given in the initial state), so I can go to the door.

I think my plan is correct and optimal.
