Okay, let's see. The problem is to get a grey ball in front of me, and I need to make sure that at some point the yellow door is unlocked. Let me start by understanding the initial state.

I'm in room_4. The grey_ball_1 is also in room_4. So maybe I can just pick that up? Wait, no, the goal is to be in front of a grey ball. But to be in front of it, I need to first go to it. But wait, the initial state has the grey_ball_1 in room_4. So if I'm already in room_4, I can gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_4. Then I would be in front of it. But wait, the preconditions for gotoobject are that I'm in the same room as the object. Since I'm in room_4 and the ball is in room_4, that should work. Then the goal would be achieved. But wait, the constraints say that the yellow door must be unlocked at least once. So even if I can achieve the goal without touching the yellow door, I need to unlock it at some point.

So the problem is that even if the solution is to just go to the grey ball in room_4, I have to include an action that unlocks the yellow door. But how?

Wait, but maybe the doors are locked, and the yellow door is locked initially. So to unlock it, I need to toggle it. But to toggle it, I need to be in front of it. But the yellow door connects room_1 and room_3. Since I'm in room_4, how do I get there?

Let's think. The doors are all initially locked. The doors connecting rooms:

- grey_door_1 connects room_1 and room_2.
- yellow_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3.
- purple_door_1 connects room_2 and room_4.
- red_door_1 connects room_3 and room_4.

So from room_4, I can go to room_2 via purple_door_1 or room_3 via red_door_1, but those doors are locked. So I need to unlock them first. But how? Because to unlock a door, I need to be in front of it. To get in front of a door, I need to be in a room that the door connects. For example, to get in front of purple_door_1, I have to be in room_2 or room_4. Since I'm in room_4, maybe I can go to the purple door. But the precondition for gotodoor is that I'm in a room connected by the door. Purple_door_1 connects room_2 and room_4, so I'm in room_4. So gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_2. Wait, the gotodoor action's arguments are (d, r1, r2)? Wait, the action is "gotodoor d r1 r2": Go in front of door d, connecting room r1 to r2. So to go to purple_door_1 from room_4, I need to specify gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_2. But the problem is that if there's an object blocking the position in front of the door in my current room. The initial state in room_4 has green_box_2, yellow_ball_1, grey_ball_1. But are any of these blocking the door? The problem statement says that in the initial state, the boxes and balls are in their rooms but doesn't mention blocking doors. Wait, the effects of the pick action mention that if x was blocking a door, then it's no longer blocked. But in the initial state, are any objects blocking doors? The problem doesn't state that. So perhaps by default, objects are not blocking doors unless specified. So maybe the doors are not blocked. So in that case, gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_2 is possible. Then I can toggle it. But purple_door_1 is locked. So after toggling, it would unlock. Then I can go from room_4 to room_2 via purple_door_1. But why would I need to do that?

Wait, the constraint is that yellow_door_1 must be unlocked at some point. So even if I don't need to use that door, I have to toggle it. So the plan must include unlocking the yellow door. But how can I get to the yellow door?

The yellow door connects room_1 and room_3. So to get to it, I need to be in either room_1 or room_3. But initially, I'm in room_4. How can I reach room_1 or room_3?

From room_4, the doors are purple (to room_2) and red (to room_3). Both are locked. So I can't go through them unless I unlock them. Let's see.

First, maybe unlock the purple door. Let's try that:

1. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_2
2. toggle purple_door_1 → now it's unlocked
3. gotoroom room_4 room_2 purple_door_1 → moves me to room_2.

Now, in room_2, there's grey_box_1 and red_ball_1. Also, the doors from room_2 are grey_door_1 (to room_1) and purple_door_1 (back to room_4). But purple is now unlocked. But the grey door connects to room_1. To unlock that door, I can go to the grey door from room_2:

4. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_1
5. toggle grey_door_1 → unlocks it
6. Then, go to room_1 via grey_door_1.

Once in room_1, I can then go to the yellow door (yellow_door_1 connects room_1 to room_3). So:

7. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3
8. toggle yellow_door_1 → unlocks it. This satisfies the constraint.

Now that the yellow door is unlocked, that's done. Now, perhaps I can go back to room_4 and pick the grey ball. But how?

Alternatively, after unlocking the yellow door, maybe proceed to room_3 via the yellow door. Let's see.

But wait, the yellow door is in room_1. So from room_1, gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1.

Then in room_3, there's the blue_ball_1 and the red_door_1 (connecting to room_4). The red_door_1 is locked. So to unlock red_door_1, I can go to it from room_3:

9. gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_4
10. toggle red_door_1 → unlocks it.

Then, go back to room_4 via red_door_1.

11. gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_1 → back to room_4.

Now, in room_4, I can gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_4. Then the goal is achieved.

But wait, the plan must also satisfy that at some point the yellow door is unlocked. Step 8 does that. So the plan up to step 11 and then step 12 would be:

But let's outline all steps:

1. gotodoor purple_door_1 room4 room2
2. toggle purple_door_1
3. gotoroom room4 room2 purple_door_1
4. gotodoor grey_door_1 room2 room1
5. toggle grey_door_1
6. gotoroom room2 room1 grey_door_1
7. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room1 room3
8. toggle yellow_door_1 (this unlocks it, satisfying the constraint)
9. gotoroom room1 room3 yellow_door_1
10. gotodoor red_door_1 room3 room4
11. toggle red_door_1
12. gotoroom room3 room4 red_door_1
13. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room4

But wait, after step 12, I'm in room4. Then, step 13 is gotoobject grey_ball_1 room4. That would put me in front of the grey ball. Then, the goal is achieved.

But is this the shortest possible plan? Let's see. Are there any unnecessary steps?

Alternatively, maybe there's a shorter path. Let's think again.

The goal is to be in front of the grey_ball_1 in room4. The constraint is that the yellow door must be unlocked at some point. So maybe instead of going all the way to room1, can I unlock the yellow door in some other way?

But the yellow door is between room1 and room3. To unlock it, I need to be in room1 or room3 and in front of it. But how can I get to room1 or room3 from room4?

From room4, the doors are purple (to room2, locked) and red (to room3, locked). So to get to room3, perhaps unlock the red door.

But the red door is in room3 and room4. So from room4, I can go to the red door:

But initially, red_door_1 is locked. So step 1: goto red_door_1 in room4.

Wait, to goto red_door_1 from room4, since the door connects room4 and room3. So gotodoor red_door_1 room4 room3. But is there any object blocking it? The initial state in room4 has green_box_2, yellow_ball_1, grey_ball_1. But if none are blocking the door, then yes. So:

1. gotodoor red_door_1 room4 room3
2. toggle red_door_1 (unlocks it)
3. gotoroom room4 room3 red_door_1 (now in room3)
4. From room3, need to get to yellow_door_1. Yellow door connects room1 and room3. So in room3, can I go to yellow_door_1?

But yellow_door_1 is in room3 and room1. So from room3, gotodoor yellow_door_1 room3 room1. Then toggle it. But how to get to room3 from room4 via red door.

So steps:

1. gotodoor red_door_1 room4 room3
2. toggle red_door_1 (unlocks)
3. gotoroom room4 room3 red_door_1 (now in room3)
4. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room3 room1
5. toggle yellow_door_1 (unlocks it; this satisfies the constraint)
6. Now, need to return to room4. From room3, can go back via red_door_1.
7. gotodoor red_door_1 room3 room4
8. gotoroom room3 room4 red_door_1 (back to room4)
9. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room4.

This plan has 9 steps and satisfies the constraint. Let's check if this works.

But in step 4, after entering room3, can I go to yellow_door_1? Because yellow_door_1 connects room3 to room1. So from room3, gotodoor yellow_door_1 room3 room1 is possible if there's no object blocking it. But the problem states that in room3, there's blue_ball_1. If that's not blocking the door, then yes. So assuming that the blue_ball_1 is not blocking the door, then step 4 is possible. Then, toggle the yellow door (step5). Now, the constraint is met. Then return to room4. Then goto grey_ball_1. So this plan is shorter than the previous one. So that's better.

But wait, the initial plan of unlocking the red door first and then yellow door may be possible. Let's count the steps:

1. gotodoor red_door_1 room4 room3 → possible? Yes, if no object is blocking. Then toggle it, then go to room3. Then goto yellow_door_1 in room3. Toggle it. Then return to room4, then go to grey_ball. So total steps:

1. gotodoor red_door_1 room4 room3
2. toggle red_door_1 → unlocks
3. gotoroom room4 room3 red_door_1 → now in room3
4. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room3 room1
5. toggle yellow_door_1 → unlocks (constraint met)
6. gotodoor red_door_1 room3 room4
7. gotoroom room3 room4 red_door_1 → back to room4
8. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room4 → done.

That's 8 steps. But wait, steps 6 and 7: after step 5, to go back to room4, you need to go through red_door_1. So in room3, you can do gotodoor red_door_1 room3 room4 (step6), then gotoroom (step7). Then step8 is gotoobject. So total 8 steps. That's better than the previous approach. Let's see if this is valid.

But in step 4, when we're in room3, gotodoor yellow_door_1 room3 room1. Then toggle it. Then in step5, the yellow door is unlocked. That meets the constraint. So this plan meets all conditions.

Now, compare to the first approach where we unlocked purple door, went to room2, then to room1, then yellow door. That was longer. So the second approach is better.

Is there an even shorter plan?

Alternatively, can we unlock the yellow door without going through room3? For example, if we go from room4 to room2 via purple door, then to room1 via grey door, then unlock yellow door from room1.

But that would involve more steps.

So the shortest possible seems to be the 8-step plan.

But let's verify each step's preconditions.

Initial state: in room4, not holding anything.

Step1: gotodoor red_door_1 room4 room3. Preconditions: (i) I'm in a room connected by the door. Yes, room4 is connected via red_door_1 to room3. (ii) No object blocking the position in front of the door in current room (room4). Since the initial objects in room4 are green_box_2, yellow_ball_1, grey_ball_1. If none are blocking, then step1 is possible.

Assuming no blocking, step1 is okay.

Step2: toggle red_door_1. Precondition: in front of red_door_1. After step1, I'm in front of red_door_1, so yes. Toggling unlocks it.

Step3: gotoroom room4 room3 red_door_1. Preconditions: (i) currently in room4 (yes), adjacent to room3 via red_door_1. (ii) door is unlocked (now yes). So step3 is okay. Now in room3.

Step4: gotodoor yellow_door_1 room3 room1. Preconditions: in a room connected by the door (room3 is connected to room1 via yellow_door_1). And no object blocking. Room3 has blue_ball_1. Assuming it's not blocking, yes. So step4 okay.

Step5: toggle yellow_door_1. Now unlocked. Constraint met.

Step6: gotodoor red_door_1 room3 room4. Preconditions: in room3, connected to room4 via red_door_1. No blocking. So yes.

Step7: gotoroom room3 room4 red_door_1. Door is unlocked (step2 toggled, then step3 used it, and no toggles since. Wait, step2 unlocked it, then step3 went through. But after step3, the door is still unlocked. Then step7: using red_door_1 again. So yes, door is unlocked.

Step8: gotoobject grey_ball_1 room4. Precondition: same room as object (yes). So after step7, I'm in room4. So step8 is possible. Then, the goal is achieved.

So this plan works and has 8 steps. Are there any steps that can be omitted?

Wait, step6 and step7: after step5, I'm in front of yellow_door_1 in room3. To return to room4, can I just go directly from room3 to room4 via red_door_1. But to do that, I need to be in front of red_door_1 again. So steps6 and 7 are necessary. So this seems minimal.

Alternatively, after step5, could I do gotodoor red_door_1 room3 room4, then gotoroom, then gotoobject. So steps6-8 as before. So no way to shorten.

Alternatively, after step3, I'm in room3. Then gotoobject blue_ball_1 room3, pick it up, then drop it somewhere else. But that's unnecessary. The goal is to be in front of a grey ball. So no need.

So the 8-step plan seems optimal. But let's check if there's any other path.

Alternatively, can we unlock the yellow door by going through room3 first?

Wait, the other path via purple door and room2 might take more steps, so the current plan is better.

Therefore, the optimal plan is the 8-step one.
