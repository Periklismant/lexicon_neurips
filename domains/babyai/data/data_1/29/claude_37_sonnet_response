Let me analyze this planning problem:

We are in a 2D gridworld with 4 rooms arranged in a square formation:
- room_1 is on the north-west
- room_2 is on the south-west
- room_3 is on the north-east
- room_4 is on the south-east

The rooms are connected by doors:
- room_1 and room_2 are connected via grey_door_1
- room_1 and room_3 are connected via yellow_door_1
- room_2 and room_4 are connected via purple_door_1
- room_3 and room_4 are connected via red_door_1

Initially:
- We are in room_4
- All doors are locked
- We are not holding any object
- There's a grey_ball_1 in room_4

The goal is to be in front of grey_ball_1.

Additionally, there's a constraint: yellow_door_1 must be unlocked at some point in the plan.

Let's think through this:

1. Since we are in room_4 and the goal is to be in front of grey_ball_1, which is also in room_4, we just need to go to that object.
2. However, we also need to unlock yellow_door_1 at some point. This door connects room_1 and room_3, but we're in room_4.
3. To go to yellow_door_1, we would need to first go to either room_1 or room_3.
4. From room_4, we can go to room_2 via purple_door_1 or to room_3 via red_door_1, but all doors are locked initially.

So, the plan would be:
1. Unlock and go through the appropriate doors to reach yellow_door_1
2. Unlock yellow_door_1 to satisfy the constraint
3. Return to room_4
4. Go in front of grey_ball_1

Let's figure out the exact sequence of actions:

Starting position: We are in room_4, and grey_ball_1 is also in room_4.

To satisfy the constraint, we need to unlock yellow_door_1, which connects room_1 and room_3. Let's plan how to get there from room_4:

Option 1: room_4 -> room_2 -> room_1 -> yellow_door_1
We would need to:
- Go to and unlock purple_door_1 (to go from room_4 to room_2)
- Go to and unlock grey_door_1 (to go from room_2 to room_1)
- Go to yellow_door_1 in room_1
- Unlock yellow_door_1

Option 2: room_4 -> room_3 -> yellow_door_1
We would need to:
- Go to and unlock red_door_1 (to go from room_4 to room_3)
- Go to yellow_door_1 in room_3
- Unlock yellow_door_1

Option 2 seems more efficient as it involves fewer door unlocks and room traversals.

So, here's the plan:
1. Go to red_door_1 in room_4
2. Unlock red_door_1
3. Go to room_3 from room_4 using red_door_1
4. Go to yellow_door_1 in room_3
5. Unlock yellow_door_1 (to satisfy the constraint)
6. Go back to room_4 (using red_door_1, which is already unlocked)
7. Go to grey_ball_1 in room_4

Now, let's translate this into the formal action sequence:

1. "gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_3" - Go to the red door in room_4
2. "toggle red_door_1" - Unlock the red door
3. "gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_1" - Go from room_4 to room_3 through the red door
4. "gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1" - Go to the yellow door in room_3
5. "toggle yellow_door_1" - Unlock the yellow door (to satisfy the constraint)
6. "gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_1" - Go back to room_4
7. "gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_4" - Go to the grey ball in room_4

Let me check if I've missed anything:
- We start in room_4.
- We are not holding any object (and don't need to pick up anything for this task).
- We need to be in front of grey_ball_1, which is in room_4.
- At some point, yellow_door_1 must be unlocked.

I believe the action sequence I've outlined accomplishes all these objectives, so this should be a valid and optimal plan.

Actually, I don't think my step 7 is a direct path. Let me make sure I have the exact action signatures right to avoid any misunderstandings:

"gotodoor d r1 r2": Go in front of door d, connecting room r1 to room r2.
"gotoobject x r": Go in front of object x in room r.

Wait, let me double-check the task and actions again.

From the task description:

"gotoobject x r": Go in front of to object x in room r.
"gotoempty": Go in front of an empty position of the room, which does not contain any object.
"gotodoor d r1 r2": Go in front of door d, connecting room r1 to room r2.
"gotoroom r1 r2 d": Go to room r2 from room r1 using door d.
"pick x r": Pick up object x in room r.
"drop x r": Drop object x in room r.
"toggle d": Unlock door d if is locked. Lock door d if is unlocked.

So, the actions I planned do match the expected signatures.

But here's an important point: after "gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_1" (step 6), we are no longer in front of the door (as per the effects of the gotoroom action). So, step 7 should be valid.

Let me review the plan again:

1. "gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_3" - Go to the red door in room_4
2. "toggle red_door_1" - Unlock the red door
3. "gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_1" - Go from room_4 to room_3 through the red door
4. "gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1" - Go to the yellow door in room_3
5. "toggle yellow_door_1" - Unlock the yellow door (to satisfy the constraint)
6. "gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_1" - Go back to room_4
7. "gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_4" - Go to the grey ball in room_4

I think this plan is valid and optimal. It addresses the goal of being in front of grey_ball_1 and ensures that yellow_door_1 is unlocked at some point.

Hmm, thinking a bit more, I realize I don't know the topology of the rooms. From the starting state:

"grey_door_1 is locked"
"yellow_door_1 is locked"
"purple_door_1 is locked"
"red_door_1 is locked"
"room_2 and room_1 are connected via grey_door_1"
"room_1 and room_2 are connected via grey_door_1"
"room_3 and room_1 are connected via yellow_door_1"
"room_1 and room_3 are connected via yellow_door_1"
"room_4 and room_2 are connected via purple_door_1"
"room_2 and room_4 are connected via purple_door_1"
"room_4 and room_3 are connected via red_door_1"
"room_3 and room_4 are connected via red_door_1"

And the description:
"room_1 is on the north-west, room_2 is on the south-west, room_3 is on the north-east and room_4 is on the south-east."

I think I'm understanding this correctly:

```
room_1 --- yellow_door_1 --- room_3
   |                          |
grey_door_1                  red_door_1
   |                          |
room_2 --- purple_door_1 --- room_4
```

Going back to our plan:

1. "gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_3" - Go to the red door in room_4
2. "toggle red_door_1" - Unlock the red door
3. "gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_1" - Go from room_4 to room_3 through the red door
4. "gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1" - Go to the yellow door in room_3
5. "toggle yellow_door_1" - Unlock the yellow door (to satisfy the constraint)
6. "gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_1" - Go back to room_4
7. "gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_4" - Go to the grey ball in room_4

This still seems valid.

Actually, let me double-check the action preconditions to ensure everything is correct.

For "gotodoor":
- We need to be in a room connected to the door.
- There should be no object blocking the door.

For "toggle":
- We need to be in front of the door.

For "gotoroom":
- We need to be in a room connected to the destination room.
- The connecting door must be unlocked.

So, for our actions:

1. "gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_3": We are in room_4, and red_door_1 connects room_4 and room_3. There's no mention of any object blocking the door, so this is valid.
2. "toggle red_door_1": We are now in front of red_door_1, so this is valid.
3. "gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_1": We are in room_4, and red_door_1 is now unlocked. This is valid.
4. "gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1": We are in room_3, and yellow_door_1 connects room_3 and room_1. There's no mention of any object blocking the door, so this is valid.
5. "toggle yellow_door_1": We are now in front of yellow_door_1, so this is valid.
6. "gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_1": We are in room_3, and red_door_1 is still unlocked. This is valid.
7. "gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_4": We are in room_4, and grey_ball_1 is in room_4. This is valid.

Alright, the plan seems to be consistent with the action preconditions. Let's proceed with this plan.

One more thing to check: are there any other constraints or goals that I might have missed? Let's revisit.

Goal:
"There is a ball v such that "The following conditions are all true: "v is grey", "you are in front of v"""

From the initial state:
"grey_ball_1 is in room_4" and "grey_ball_1 is grey"

So, the goal is to be in front of grey_ball_1, which our plan accomplishes.

Constraint:
"The following expression must hold in at least one state: "yellow_door_1 is not locked""

Our plan includes an action to unlock yellow_door_1, so this constraint is satisfied.

It seems like we've covered everything. The plan is valid and optimal.

Wait, actually I made a small oversight. To be absolutely certain, let me check the exact wording of the precondition for the "gotodoor" action.

"goto door": you may only go in front of a door d if (i) you are in a room which door d is connecting with another room, and (ii) there is no object blocking the position in front of d in the room you are currently in.

From the initial state:
"yellow_ball_1 is in room_4"
"grey_ball_1 is in room_4"
"green_box_2 is in room_4"

There's no explicit mention that any of these objects are blocking a door. But to be safe, let's assume they might be blocking red_door_1. In that case, we might need to pick up and move any objects that are blocking our path.

But I realize I don't have any information about which objects are blocking which doors. So, I'll assume that there are no obstructions for now. If there were, I'd adjust the plan to first pick up and move any blocking objects.

And I think the plan is valid and optimal:

1. "gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_3" - Go to the red door in room_4
2. "toggle red_door_1" - Unlock the red door
3. "gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_1" - Go from room_4 to room_3 through the red door
4. "gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1" - Go to the yellow door in room_3
5. "toggle yellow_door_1" - Unlock the yellow door (to satisfy the constraint)
6. "gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_1" - Go back to room_4
7. "gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_4" - Go to the grey ball in room_4

Let me make sure these are the right actions. Let's check the format for each one:

- "gotoobject x r": It's "gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_4", which is correct.
- "gotodoor d r1 r2": It's "gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_3" and "gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1", which is correct.
- "gotoroom r1 r2 d": It's "gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_1" and "gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_1", which is correct.
- "toggle d": It's "toggle red_door_1" and "toggle yellow_door_1", which is correct.

So, our plan is:

1. "gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_3"
2. "toggle red_door_1"
3. "gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_1"
4. "gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1"
5. "toggle yellow_door_1"
6. "gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_1"
7. "gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_4"

This plan follows all the constraints, satisfies the goal, and appears to be optimal in terms of the number of actions required.

Actually, I just realized this plan might not work because of one of the preconditions for "gotodoor". Let me double-check.

Preconditions for "gotodoor":
You may only go in front of a door d if (i) you are in a room which door d is connecting with another room, and (ii) there is no object blocking the position in front of d in the room you are currently in.

The issue: I noticed there are multiple objects in room_4, but I don't know if any of them are blocking the red_door_1. If one of them is, then our plan won't work as is.

But I don't have information about objects blocking doors in the initial state. Let's assume no objects are blocking any doors for now.

Another point to check about the preconditions for "gotoobject":
You may only go in front of an object x if you are in the same room as x.

Our plan has us going to grey_ball_1 in room_4, and we're already in room_4 after step 6, so this precondition is met.

I think the plan is valid and optimal, assuming that no objects are blocking any doors.

Here's the final plan:

1. "gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_3"
2. "toggle red_door_1"
3. "gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_1"
4. "gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1"
5. "toggle yellow_door_1"
6. "gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_1"
7. "gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_4"

This plan follows all the constraints, satisfies the goal, and appears to be optimal in terms of the number of actions required.

Wait, let me review the goal again to make sure I'm understanding the goal correctly.

"There is a ball v such that "The following conditions are all true: "v is grey", "you are in front of v"""

This goal is asking for a grey ball (any grey ball) that you're in front of. In the initial state, there's one grey ball, grey_ball_1, and it's in room_4.

So, the goal is to be in front of grey_ball_1, which our plan accomplishes. And, to satisfy the constraint, we also unlock yellow_door_1 during the execution.

I think the plan is valid and optimal. Here it is again:

1. "gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_3"
2. "toggle red_door_1"
3. "gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_1"
4. "gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1"
5. "toggle yellow_door_1"
6. "gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_1"
7. "gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_4"

I am satisfied with this plan.

Actually, I'm thinking:

Is there a more direct approach to our goal? We are already in room_4, and grey_ball_1 is also in room_4. So, couldn't we directly go to it without all the door unlocking? But we have the constraint that yellow_door_1 must be unlocked at some point. Given this constraint, our plan is optimal.

But it makes me think: perhaps we can reorder our actions for optimization.

Let me see if there's a more efficient order:

1. "gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_4" - First go to the grey ball to satisfy the main goal
2. "gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_3" - Then go to the red door
3. "toggle red_door_1" - Unlock the red door
4. "gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_1" - Go to room_3
5. "gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1" - Go to the yellow door
6. "toggle yellow_door_1" - Unlock the yellow door to satisfy the constraint

This is a valid plan too. But, upon reflection, it's not any more optimal (still 6 steps), and it might be less desirable for some contexts since we don't return to our original room. 

Actually, hold on, that's only 6 steps. 

And I think it's what we need. We don't need to return to room_4 because we've already satisfied the goal by being in front of grey_ball_1 in step 1, and we've satisfied the constraint by unlocking yellow_door_1 in step 6.

So, the optimal plan would be:

1. "gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_4"
2. "gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_3"
3. "toggle red_door_1"
4. "gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_1"
5. "gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1"
6. "toggle yellow_door_1"

This is a 6-step plan, which is more efficient than the original 7-step plan.

But let me double-check the task description to see if being in front of the grey ball is a final state or if there are other requirements.

"The task is to bring about the following situation:
	"There is a ball v such that "The following conditions are all true: "v is grey", "you are in front of v"""

It seems that the goal is to be in front of a grey ball, which our plan satisfies in step 1. The constraint about unlocking yellow_door_1 is separately satisfied in step 6. So, I think the 6-step plan is indeed more optimal.

Actually, the more I think about it, the goal can be satisfied right away with just one step:

"gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_4"

But we also need to satisfy the constraint that yellow_door_1 is unlocked at some point. So, we need to go through the door unlocking process as well. Given that, the 6-step plan is the most direct way to satisfy both the goal and the constraint.

However, I realized the first ordering I provided (the 7-step plan) might be better if we're considering the final state. In that plan, we return to room_4 and are in front of the grey ball in the final step. This is because the goal requires us to be in front of a grey ball, and if we go with the 6-step plan, we'd end up in room_3 in front of yellow_door_1, not in front of the grey ball.

Let me think more carefully: is the goal to reach a state where we are in front of a grey ball, or is it to be in front of a grey ball at the end of the plan?

Let's return to the task description to make sure:

"The task is to bring about the following situation:
	"There is a ball v such that "The following conditions are all true: "v is grey", "you are in front of v"""

It says "The task is to bring about the following situation," which suggests that the goal is to reach a state where we are in front of a grey ball. The sequence of steps we take to reach that state is not important, as long as the constraint about yellow_door_1 is met at some point during the execution of the plan.

Given this interpretation, the most optimal plan would indeed be:

1. "gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_4"
2. "gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_3"
3. "toggle red_door_1"
4. "gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_1"
5. "gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1"
6. "toggle yellow_door_1"

With this plan, we first satisfy the goal by being in front of grey_ball_1 in step 1, and then we go on to satisfy the constraint by unlocking yellow_door_1 in step 6. This plan is valid and more efficient than the original 7-step plan.

Actually, there's a subtle issue I hadn't considered. After the action "gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_4", we will be in front of the grey ball. But after the next action "gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_3", we won't be in front of the grey ball anymore. The goal is to reach a state where we are in front of a grey ball, but subsequent actions might invalidate that state.

This suggests that the task requires us to reach a state where we are in front of a grey ball, and then stop. Any actions after that would change our state and potentially invalidate the goal.

Given this interpretation, the plan would simply be:

"gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_4"

But this doesn't satisfy the constraint about yellow_door_1. Hmm, this is a bit of a conundrum.

Let me revisit the goal and constraint once more.

Goal: Reach a state where we are in front of a grey ball.
Constraint: At some point during the execution of the plan, yellow_door_1 must be unlocked.

If we interpret the goal as a final state, then we'd need to end up in front of a grey ball. The most efficient way to do this and also satisfy the constraint would be the 7-step plan:

1. "gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_3"
2. "toggle red_door_1"
3. "gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_1"
4. "gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1"
5. "toggle yellow_door_1"
6. "gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_1"
7. "gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_4"

However, if we interpret the goal more broadly as "reach a state where we are in front of a grey ball at any point during the execution", then we could have:

1. "gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_4"  (at this point, we've reached the goal state)
2. "gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_3"
3. "toggle red_door_1"
4. "gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_1"
5. "gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1"
6. "toggle yellow_door_1"  (at this point, we've satisfied the constraint)

But I think the traditional interpretation of planning problems is that the goal is a state we want to reach at the end of the plan execution.

Actually, after thinking more about it, I'm convinced the goal is to end up in front of a grey ball. In the goal description, it says "There is a ball v such that The following conditions are all true: v is grey, you are in front of v". And the preamble says "your task is to provide a valid sequence of actions that solves the planning problem, i.e., bringing about the goal of the problem while satisfying all constraints".

This, to me, indicates that the goal is the state we want to end up in, and the constraint is a condition that must be met during the execution of the actions.

So, the 7-step plan is the correct one:

1. "gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_3"
2. "toggle red_door_1"
3. "gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_1"
4. "gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1"
5. "toggle yellow_door_1"
6. "gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_1"
7. "gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_4"

This is my final answer, which I've double-checked and believe is correct. It involves unlocking yellow_door_1 (to satisfy the constraint) and ends with us in front of a grey ball (to satisfy the goal).

But actually, I'm second-guessing myself again. Let's look at the prompt one more time.

The task description says:
"Provided a planning problem, consisting of an initial state of the world, a final goal and a set of constraints, your task is to provide a valid sequence of actions that solves the planning problem, i.e., bringing about the goal of the problem while satisfying all constraints."

The goal is:
"There is a ball v such that "The following conditions are all true: "v is grey", "you are in front of v"""

And the constraint is:
"The following expression must hold in at least one state: "yellow_door_1 is not locked""

I think the most reasonable interpretation is that the goal is the state we want to reach at the end of the plan, and the constraint is a condition that must be met during the execution.

Given that, the 7-step plan is the correct one. It involves unlocking yellow_door_1 (to satisfy the constraint) and ends with us in front of a grey ball (to satisfy the goal).

1. "gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_3"
2. "toggle red_door_1"
3. "gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_1"
4. "gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1"
5. "toggle yellow_door_1"
6. "gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_1"
7. "gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_4"

This is our answer.
