Alright, let's understand the problem:

We are in a 2D gridworld with 4 rooms arranged in a square formation. The rooms are room_1 (northwest), room_2 (southwest), room_3 (northeast), and room_4 (southeast). The rooms are connected by doors, and the doors, boxes, and balls in the world are all colored.

The initial state is:
- We are in room_1
- grey_ball_1 is in room_1
- grey_box_1 is in room_1
- purple_ball_1 is in room_2
- yellow_box_1 is in room_2
- grey_ball_2 is in room_2
- blue_ball_1 is in room_3
- purple_box_1 is in room_4
- yellow_box_2 is in room_4
- All doors are locked
- We've visited room_1

The goal is to be in front of a grey ball.

The constraints are that at some point, yellow_box_2 must be in room_3 and grey_door_1 must be unlocked.

Let's think about the plan:

1. Since we're in room_1 and there's a grey ball (grey_ball_1) in the same room, the simplest approach would be to just go in front of that ball.
   But we need to satisfy the constraint that at some point, yellow_box_2 is in room_3 and grey_door_1 is not locked.

2. yellow_box_2 is currently in room_4, and grey_door_1 connects room_4 and room_3.
   So, we'll need to:
   - Go to room_4
   - Pick up yellow_box_2
   - Unlock grey_door_1
   - Go to room_3
   - Drop yellow_box_2
   - Go back to room_1 (if necessary)
   - Go in front of grey_ball_1

Let's check if there's an easier way to reach our goal by exploring the connections between rooms:

- room_1 (where we are) is connected to room_2 via purple_door_1 and to room_3 via green_door_1
- room_2 is connected to room_4 via purple_door_2
- room_3 is connected to room_4 via grey_door_1

So, to reach room_4, we can either go:
- room_1 -> room_2 -> room_4, or
- room_1 -> room_3 -> room_4

Once we reach room_4, we can pick up yellow_box_2, unlock grey_door_1, go to room_3, drop yellow_box_2, and then either:
- Go back to room_1 and go in front of grey_ball_1, or
- Stay in room_3 (since there's no grey ball in room_3), so we'll need to go back to room_1 or room_2 where there are grey balls.

Actually, I just realized there's another grey ball (grey_ball_2) in room_2, so we could also go to room_2 and go in front of that.

But let's plan the most direct route to satisfy the goal and the constraint:

1. Go to room_1 (already there)
2. Go in front of grey_ball_1 (to satisfy the goal)

But wait, we also need to satisfy the constraint. Let's see if we can do that:

1. Go to room_1 (already there)
2. Go to door green_door_1 (connecting room_1 and room_3)
3. Toggle green_door_1 (to unlock it)
4. Go to room room_3 room_1 green_door_1
5. Go to door grey_door_1 (connecting room_3 and room_4)
6. Toggle grey_door_1 (to unlock it)
7. Go to room room_4 room_3 grey_door_1
8. Go to object yellow_box_2 room_4
9. Pick yellow_box_2 room_4
10. Go to door grey_door_1 (connecting room_4 and room_3)
11. Go to room room_3 room_4 grey_door_1
12. Go to an empty position
13. Drop yellow_box_2 room_3 (Now yellow_box_2 is in room_3 and grey_door_1 is unlocked, satisfying the constraint)
14. Go to door green_door_1 (connecting room_3 and room_1)
15. Go to room room_1 room_3 green_door_1
16. Go to object grey_ball_1 room_1
(Now we're in front of grey_ball_1, satisfying the goal)

Wait, let me check the available actions to make sure I'm using the correct syntax. Let's double-check:

- "gotoobject x r": Go in front of to object x in room r.
- "gotoempty": Go in front of an empty position of the room, which does not contain any object.
- "gotodoor d r1 r2": Go in front of door d, connecting room r1 to room r2.
- "gotoroom r1 r2 d": Go to room r2 from room r1 using door d.
- "pick x r": Pick up object x in room r.
- "drop x r": Drop object x in room r.
- "toggle d": Unlock door d if is locked. Lock door d if is unlocked.

Let me revise my plan:

1. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_1 (I now realize we don't need to wait until the end to satisfy the goal)
(Now we're in front of grey_ball_1, satisfying the goal. But we still need to satisfy the constraint)
2. gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3
3. toggle green_door_1
4. gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1
5. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4
6. toggle grey_door_1 (Now grey_door_1 is unlocked, part of the constraint)
7. gotoroom room_3 room_4 grey_door_1
8. gotoobject yellow_box_2 room_4
9. pick yellow_box_2 room_4
10. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3
11. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1
12. gotoempty
13. drop yellow_box_2 room_3 (Now yellow_box_2 is in room_3, satisfying the constraint)

But I realized we had satisfied the goal in the first step, so we're done, right? Let's carefully re-read the goal and constraints:

Goal: "There is a ball v such that "The following conditions are all true: "v is grey", "you are in front of v"""

Constraint: "The following expression must hold in at least one state: "The following conditions are all true: "yellow_box_2 is in room_3", "grey_door_1 is not locked"""

So the goal is to be in front of a grey ball, and at some point, yellow_box_2 must be in room_3 and grey_door_1 must be unlocked. It doesn't say anything about the final state, just that this constraint needs to be satisfied at least once during the execution of the plan.

Let's use the above plan to satisfy both the goal and the constraint:

Let's revise the plan with the correct action syntax:

1. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_1
   - This satisfies the goal, as we're now in front of a grey ball.

But we still need to satisfy the constraint. So we continue:

2. gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3
3. toggle green_door_1
4. gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1
5. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4
6. toggle grey_door_1 (Now grey_door_1 is unlocked, part of the constraint)
7. gotoroom room_3 room_4 grey_door_1
8. gotoobject yellow_box_2 room_4
9. pick yellow_box_2 room_4
10. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3
11. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1
12. gotoempty
13. drop yellow_box_2 room_3 (Now yellow_box_2 is in room_3 and grey_door_1 is unlocked, satisfying the constraint)

But now I'm not in front of a grey ball anymore because after moving away from grey_ball_1 in room_1, I haven't gone back to be in front of it or any other grey ball. So the goal is no longer satisfied.

So, we should end the plan by going back to room_1 and standing in front of grey_ball_1 again, or alternatively, finding another grey ball to stand in front of.

Let's revise the plan one more time. Actually, let's check the locations of all the grey balls again:

- grey_ball_1 is in room_1
- grey_ball_2 is in room_2

We know we need yellow_box_2 to be in room_3 and grey_door_1 to be unlocked. Let's try to plan a path where at the end we're standing in front of a grey ball:

1. gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3
2. toggle green_door_1
3. gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1
4. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4
5. toggle grey_door_1 (Now grey_door_1 is unlocked, part of the constraint)
6. gotoroom room_3 room_4 grey_door_1
7. gotoobject yellow_box_2 room_4
8. pick yellow_box_2 room_4
9. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3
10. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1
11. gotoempty
12. drop yellow_box_2 room_3 (Now yellow_box_2 is in room_3 and grey_door_1 is unlocked, satisfying the constraint)
13. gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_1
14. gotoroom room_3 room_1 green_door_1
15. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_1 (Now we're in front of grey_ball_1, satisfying the goal)

With this plan, both the goal and the constraint would be satisfied.

But now that I think about it, let's think of a more efficient route. Maybe we can go to room_2 which has grey_ball_2 after satisfying the constraint? Let's see if that's more efficient:

The constraint is that yellow_box_2 should be in room_3 and grey_door_1 should be unlocked. grey_door_1 connects room_3 and room_4, and yellow_box_2 is in room_4. So we need to:

1. Go to room_4.
2. Pick up yellow_box_2.
3. Unlock grey_door_1.
4. Go to room_3.
5. Drop yellow_box_2.

Now, from room_3, we could go to either room_1 to be in front of grey_ball_1 or to room_2 to be in front of grey_ball_2.

Let's check the connections again:
- room_1 is connected to room_2 via purple_door_1 and to room_3 via green_door_1
- room_2 is connected to room_4 via purple_door_2
- room_3 is connected to room_4 via grey_door_1

So from room_3, we can go directly to room_1 via green_door_1, but to reach room_2, we'd need to go room_3 -> room_1 -> room_2 or room_3 -> room_4 -> room_2.

The shortest path then would be to go from room_3 to room_1 to be in front of grey_ball_1. This confirms our previously revised plan.

Actually, I just realized we need to consider that all doors are initially locked. So we'll need to unlock each door as we move through rooms. Let's revise the plan once more:

1. gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3
2. toggle green_door_1 (Unlocking green_door_1)
3. gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1
4. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4
5. toggle grey_door_1 (Unlocking grey_door_1, part of the constraint)
6. gotoroom room_3 room_4 grey_door_1
7. gotoobject yellow_box_2 room_4
8. pick yellow_box_2 room_4
9. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3
10. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1
11. gotoempty
12. drop yellow_box_2 room_3 (Now yellow_box_2 is in room_3 and grey_door_1 is unlocked, satisfying the constraint)
13. gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_1
14. gotoroom room_3 room_1 green_door_1
15. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_1 (Now we're in front of grey_ball_1, satisfying the goal)

Hmm, let's also double-check if this is the most efficient plan. Could we also reach a grey ball in room_2? Let's check:

To go from room_1 (our starting point) to room_2:
1. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2
2. toggle purple_door_1 (Unlocking purple_door_1)
3. gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1
4. gotoobject grey_ball_2 room_2

That's 4 steps, which is faster than the 15 steps I outlined above. But we also need to satisfy the constraint. Let's incorporate that:

1. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2
2. toggle purple_door_1 (Unlocking purple_door_1)
3. gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1
4. gotodoor purple_door_2 room_2 room_4
5. toggle purple_door_2 (Unlocking purple_door_2)
6. gotoroom room_2 room_4 purple_door_2
7. gotoobject yellow_box_2 room_4
8. pick yellow_box_2 room_4
9. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3
10. toggle grey_door_1 (Unlocking grey_door_1, part of the constraint)
11. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1
12. gotoempty
13. drop yellow_box_2 room_3 (Now yellow_box_2 is in room_3 and grey_door_1 is unlocked, satisfying the constraint)
14. gotoobject grey_ball_2 room_2

Hmm, step 14 doesn't make sense because we're not in room_2 anymore. So let's revise:

1. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2
2. toggle purple_door_1 (Unlocking purple_door_1)
3. gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1
4. gotodoor purple_door_2 room_2 room_4
5. toggle purple_door_2 (Unlocking purple_door_2)
6. gotoroom room_2 room_4 purple_door_2
7. gotoobject yellow_box_2 room_4
8. pick yellow_box_2 room_4
9. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3
10. toggle grey_door_1 (Unlocking grey_door_1, part of the constraint)
11. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1
12. gotoempty
13. drop yellow_box_2 room_3 (Now yellow_box_2 is in room_3 and grey_door_1 is unlocked, satisfying the constraint)
14. gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_1
15. toggle green_door_1 (Unlocking green_door_1)
16. gotoroom room_3 room_1 green_door_1
17. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2
18. gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1
19. gotoobject grey_ball_2 room_2

That's 19 steps. It seems that if we want to satisfy the constraint and be in front of a grey ball, it might be more efficient to go for grey_ball_1 in room_1, as we had in the original plan.

Wait, I forgot an important part. The goal states: "There is a ball v such that "The following conditions are all true: "v is grey", "you are in front of v""". This means that we need to be in front of any grey ball by the end of the plan. It doesn't specify a particular grey ball.

So, if we're thinking about optimality in terms of the number of steps, let's check which one is more efficient:

To be in front of grey_ball_1 in room_1:
1. gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3
2. toggle green_door_1 (Unlocking green_door_1)
3. gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1
4. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4
5. toggle grey_door_1 (Unlocking grey_door_1, part of the constraint)
6. gotoroom room_3 room_4 grey_door_1
7. gotoobject yellow_box_2 room_4
8. pick yellow_box_2 room_4
9. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3
10. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1
11. gotoempty
12. drop yellow_box_2 room_3 (Now yellow_box_2 is in room_3 and grey_door_1 is unlocked, satisfying the constraint)
13. gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_1
14. gotoroom room_3 room_1 green_door_1
15. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_1 (Now we're in front of grey_ball_1, satisfying the goal)

This is 15 steps.

To be in front of grey_ball_2 in room_2, we'd need to go through room_1 to room_2:
1. gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3
2. toggle green_door_1 (Unlocking green_door_1)
3. gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1
4. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4
5. toggle grey_door_1 (Unlocking grey_door_1, part of the constraint)
6. gotoroom room_3 room_4 grey_door_1
7. gotoobject yellow_box_2 room_4
8. pick yellow_box_2 room_4
9. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3
10. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1
11. gotoempty
12. drop yellow_box_2 room_3 (Now yellow_box_2 is in room_3 and grey_door_1 is unlocked, satisfying the constraint)
13. gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_1
14. gotoroom room_3 room_1 green_door_1
15. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2
16. toggle purple_door_1 (Unlocking purple_door_1)
17. gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1
18. gotoobject grey_ball_2 room_2 (Now we're in front of grey_ball_2, satisfying the goal)

That's 18 steps. So, going for grey_ball_1 in room_1 seems to be more efficient.

Let's go with the plan to be in front of grey_ball_1 in room_1.

Actually, I just realized there's an even simpler solution. Since the goal is to be in front of a grey ball, and we start in room_1 which has a grey ball (grey_ball_1), we could just go in front of that ball:

1. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_1

This satisfies the goal in just 1 step. But we still need to satisfy the constraint that, at some point, yellow_box_2 is in room_3 and grey_door_1 is not locked. So, we'd still need the steps to achieve that.

But wait, let's think about this again. The goal is to be in front of a grey ball in the final state, not necessarily throughout the entire plan. And the constraint is that at some point during the execution of the plan, yellow_box_2 is in room_3 and grey_door_1 is not locked.

So, the most efficient plan would be:
1. Go in front of grey_ball_1 in room_1 (satisfying the goal).
2. Perform the steps to ensure that at some point yellow_box_2 is in room_3 and grey_door_1 is not locked (satisfying the constraint).
3. Return to being in front of a grey ball (so that the goal is satisfied in the final state).

Let's plan this out:

1. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_1 (satisfying the goal initially)
2. gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3
3. toggle green_door_1 (Unlocking green_door_1)
4. gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1
5. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4
6. toggle grey_door_1 (Unlocking grey_door_1, part of the constraint)
7. gotoroom room_3 room_4 grey_door_1
8. gotoobject yellow_box_2 room_4
9. pick yellow_box_2 room_4
10. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3
11. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1
12. gotoempty
13. drop yellow_box_2 room_3 (Now yellow_box_2 is in room_3 and grey_door_1 is unlocked, satisfying the constraint)
14. gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_1
15. gotoroom room_3 room_1 green_door_1
16. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_1 (Now we're in front of grey_ball_1, satisfying the goal in the final state)

This plan ensures that the goal is satisfied in the final state, and the constraint is satisfied at least once during the execution of the plan. It's 16 steps, which isn't as efficient as just going in front of grey_ball_1 as the final step, but if the goal needs to be satisfied in the final state, then this seems to be the most efficient plan.

Actually, let's double-check if the goal specifies that we need to be in front of a grey ball at the final state. It says:
"There is a ball v such that "The following conditions are all true: "v is grey", "you are in front of v""".

The statement doesn't explicitly state that it needs to be the final state, but I'm going to assume that it does, as is typical in planning problems. So we'll go with the 16-step plan.

But wait, I think I may have overlooked an even simpler solution. The goal is to be in front of a grey ball, and there's a grey ball in the room we start in (room_1). So we can just go in front of that ball:

1. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_1

But this doesn't satisfy the constraint. So let's continue:

1. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_1
2. pick grey_ball_1 room_1
3. gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3
4. toggle green_door_1 (Unlocking green_door_1)
5. gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1
6. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4
7. toggle grey_door_1 (Unlocking grey_door_1, part of the constraint)
8. gotoroom room_3 room_4 grey_door_1
9. gotoobject yellow_box_2 room_4
10. drop grey_ball_1 room_4
11. pick yellow_box_2 room_4
12. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3
13. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1
14. gotoempty
15. drop yellow_box_2 room_3 (Now yellow_box_2 is in room_3 and grey_door_1 is unlocked, satisfying the constraint)
16. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_4
17. pick grey_ball_1 room_4
18. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4
19. gotoroom room_3 room_4 grey_door_1
20. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3
21. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1
22. gotoempty
23. drop grey_ball_1 room_3
24. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_3

This plan is even longer with 24 steps. So it's not more efficient.

Instead of carrying grey_ball_1 with us, let's forget about it and find another grey ball. There's grey_ball_2 in room_2. After satisfying the constraint, we could go to room_2 and stand in front of grey_ball_2.

Let's revisit the plan where we don't pick up grey_ball_1 but instead go to grey_ball_2 in room_2 after satisfying the constraint:

1. gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3
2. toggle green_door_1 (Unlocking green_door_1)
3. gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1
4. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4
5. toggle grey_door_1 (Unlocking grey_door_1, part of the constraint)
6. gotoroom room_3 room_4 grey_door_1
7. gotoobject yellow_box_2 room_4
8. pick yellow_box_2 room_4
9. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3
10. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1
11. gotoempty
12. drop yellow_box_2 room_3 (Now yellow_box_2 is in room_3 and grey_door_1 is unlocked, satisfying the constraint)

Now, we need to find a grey ball to stand in front of. Grey_ball_1 is in room_1, and grey_ball_2 is in room_2. Let's find the most efficient way to reach either of them:

To get to room_1 (grey_ball_1):
13. gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_1
14. gotoroom room_3 room_1 green_door_1 (we're in room_1)
15. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_1 (we're in front of grey_ball_1, satisfying the goal)

That's 15 steps total.

To get to room_2 (grey_ball_2):
13. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4
14. gotoroom room_3 room_4 grey_door_1 (we're in room_4)
15. gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_2
16. toggle purple_door_2 (Unlocking purple_door_2)
17. gotoroom room_4 room_2 purple_door_2 (we're in room_2)
18. gotoobject grey_ball_2 room_2 (we're in front of grey_ball_2, satisfying the goal)

That's 18 steps total.

So, it's more efficient to go to room_1 and stand in front of grey_ball_1 after satisfying the constraint.

Let's finalize the plan:

1. gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3
2. toggle green_door_1 (Unlocking green_door_1)
3. gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1
4. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4
5. toggle grey_door_1 (Unlocking grey_door_1, part of the constraint)
6. gotoroom room_3 room_4 grey_door_1
7. gotoobject yellow_box_2 room_4
8. pick yellow_box_2 room_4
9. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3
10. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1
11. gotoempty
12. drop yellow_box_2 room_3 (Now yellow_box_2 is in room_3 and grey_door_1 is unlocked, satisfying the constraint)
13. gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_1
14. gotoroom room_3 room_1 green_door_1
15. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_1 (Now we're in front of grey_ball_1, satisfying the goal)

Wait, I just realized a potential shortcut. What if we simply grabbed grey_ball_1 from room_1, then carried it with us while we did everything else, and finally dropped it and stood in front of it?

1. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_1
2. pick grey_ball_1 room_1 (now we're holding the ball)
3. gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3
4. toggle green_door_1 (Unlocking green_door_1)
5. gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1
6. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4
7. toggle grey_door_1 (Unlocking grey_door_1, part of the constraint)
8. gotoroom room_3 room_4 grey_door_1
9. gotoobject yellow_box_2 room_4
10. drop grey_ball_1 room_4 (we have to drop it because we can't hold two objects at once)
11. pick yellow_box_2 room_4
12. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3
13. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1
14. gotoempty
15. drop yellow_box_2 room_3 (Now yellow_box_2 is in room_3 and grey_door_1 is unlocked, satisfying the constraint)
16. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4
17. gotoroom room_3 room_4 grey_door_1
18. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_4
19. pick grey_ball_1 room_4
20. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3
21. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1 (actually, we could drop it in any room now, but I chose room_3 arbitrarily)
22. gotoempty
23. drop grey_ball_1 room_3
24. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_3 (Now we're in front of grey_ball_1, satisfying the goal)

This plan has 24 steps, which is longer than our previous plan. So it's not more efficient.

Let's go back to the 15-step plan without moving grey_ball_1:

1. gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3
2. toggle green_door_1 (Unlocking green_door_1)
3. gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1
4. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4
5. toggle grey_door_1 (Unlocking grey_door_1, part of the constraint)
6. gotoroom room_3 room_4 grey_door_1
7. gotoobject yellow_box_2 room_4
8. pick yellow_box_2 room_4
9. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3
10. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1
11. gotoempty
12. drop yellow_box_2 room_3 (Now yellow_box_2 is in room_3 and grey_door_1 is unlocked, satisfying the constraint)
13. gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_1
14. gotoroom room_3 room_1 green_door_1
15. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_1 (Now we're in front of grey_ball_1, satisfying the goal)

This seems to be the most efficient plan, so let's finalize it.

Wait, thinking about it more, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let's think about the initial state again:

"you are in room_1"
"grey_ball_1 is in room_1"

So the simplest plan would be:
1. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_1

This satisfies the goal in just one step. But we still need to satisfy the constraint:
"The following expression must hold in at least one state: "The following conditions are all true: "yellow_box_2 is in room_3", "grey_door_1 is not locked"""

So we'd still need to do a bunch of actions to bring yellow_box_2 to room_3 and have grey_door_1 unlocked at some point. The plan I provided above does that and then has us standing in front of grey_ball_1 at the end, satisfying the goal.

But actually, let's take another route. First, let's satisfy the goal to be in front of a grey ball:
1. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_1

But we also need to satisfy the constraint. Let's now go get yellow_box_2 and move it to room_3, while having grey_door_1 unlocked:
2. pick grey_ball_1 room_1 (we pick up the ball so we can move it with us)
3. gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3
4. toggle green_door_1 (Unlocking green_door_1)
5. gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1
6. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4
7. toggle grey_door_1 (Unlocking grey_door_1, part of the constraint)
8. gotoroom room_3 room_4 grey_door_1
9. gotoobject yellow_box_2 room_4
10. drop grey_ball_1 room_4 (we drop the grey ball to pick up the yellow box)
11. pick yellow_box_2 room_4
12. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3
13. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1
14. gotoempty
15. drop yellow_box_2 room_3 (Now yellow_box_2 is in room_3 and grey_door_1 is unlocked, satisfying the constraint)
16. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_4 (to pick it up again and bring it back to be in front of it)
17. pick grey_ball_1 room_4
18. gotoempty
19. drop grey_ball_1 room_3
20. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_3 (Now we're in front of grey_ball_1, satisfying the goal)

This approach is 20 steps, which is 5 steps more than our earlier approach. So, the 15-step approach seems to be the most efficient.

Actually, let's take another approach. What if we just go to grey_ball_2 in room_2?

1. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2
2. toggle purple_door_1 (Unlocking purple_door_1)
3. gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1
4. gotoobject grey_ball_2 room_2 (Now we're in front of grey_ball_2, which is a grey ball, satisfying the goal)

This is just 4 steps. But we still need to satisfy the constraint.

4. pick grey_ball_2 room_2 (can't hold two objects, so we'll move this ball)
5. gotodoor purple_door_2 room_2 room_4
6. toggle purple_door_2 (Unlocking purple_door_2)
7. gotoroom room_2 room_4 purple_door_2
8. gotoobject yellow_box_2 room_4
9. drop grey_ball_2 room_4 (dropping the ball to pick up the yellow box)
10. pick yellow_box_2 room_4
11. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3
12. toggle grey_door_1 (Unlocking grey_door_1, part of the constraint)
13. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1
14. gotoempty
15. drop yellow_box_2 room_3 (Now yellow_box_2 is in room_3 and grey_door_1 is unlocked, satisfying the constraint)
16. gotoobject grey_ball_2 room_4 (to pick it up again and bring it back to be in front of it)
17. pick grey_ball_2 room_4
18. gotoempty
19. drop grey_ball_2 room_3
20. gotoobject grey_ball_2 room_3 (Now we're in front of grey_ball_2, which is a grey ball, satisfying the goal)

This approach is 20 steps.

Wait, I think I'm overthinking this. Let's simplify the problem and find the shortest sequence of actions.

The goal is to be in front of a grey ball. There are two grey balls: grey_ball_1 in room_1 and grey_ball_2 in room_2. We're already in room_1, so it's just 1 step to be in front of grey_ball_1.

The constraint is that yellow_box_2 should be in room_3 and grey_door_1 should be unlocked at some point. So, we need to move yellow_box_2 from room_4 to room_3, and we need to unlock grey_door_1 which connects room_3 and room_4.

So, if we forget about going back to be in front of a grey ball for a moment, the most direct actions to satisfy the constraint would be:
1. Unlock the door to room_3 from room_1.
2. Go to room_3.
3. Unlock grey_door_1 which connects room_3 and room_4.
4. Go to room_4.
5. Pick up yellow_box_2 from room_4.
6. Go back to room_3.
7. Drop yellow_box_2 in room_3.

Now, after satisfying this constraint, the most efficient action would be to go back to room_1 and stand in front of grey_ball_1, which would be the goal.

Let's put this plan together:

1. gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3
2. toggle green_door_1 (Unlocking green_door_1)
3. gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1
4. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4
5. toggle grey_door_1 (Unlocking grey_door_1, part of the constraint)
6. gotoroom room_3 room_4 grey_door_1
7. gotoobject yellow_box_2 room_4
8. pick yellow_box_2 room_4
9. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3
10. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1
11. gotoempty
12. drop yellow_box_2 room_3 (Now yellow_box_2 is in room_3 and grey_door_1 is unlocked, satisfying the constraint)
13. gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_1
14. gotoroom room_3 room_1 green_door_1
15. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_1 (Now we're in front of grey_ball_1, satisfying the goal)

I think this is the most efficient plan, with 15 steps. It's efficient because:
1. We're directly starting to work on satisfying the constraint.
2. After satisfying the constraint, we take the most direct route to be in front of a grey ball, which is to go back to room_1 and be in front of grey_ball_1.

So, the shortest valid plan is:

1. gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3
2. toggle green_door_1
3. gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1
4. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4
5. toggle grey_door_1
6. gotoroom room_3 room_4 grey_door_1
7. gotoobject yellow_box_2 room_4
8. pick yellow_box_2 room_4
9. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3
10. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1
11. gotoempty
12. drop yellow_box_2 room_3
13. gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_1
14. gotoroom room_3 room_1 green_door_1
15. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_1
