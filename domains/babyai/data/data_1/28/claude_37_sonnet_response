Let me understand the problem. We are in a 2D gridworld with 4 rooms arranged in a square formation, with doors connecting them. The rooms may contain boxes and balls. We can move around, pick up and drop objects, and toggle doors between locked and unlocked states.

Here's a visualization of the gridworld:
```
+--------+--------+
|        |        |
| room_1 | room_3 |
|        |        |
+---==---+---==---+
|        |        |
| room_2 | room_4 |
|        |        |
+--------+--------+
```
Where the `==` represents doors connecting the rooms.

From the problem description:
- `room_1` (northwest) and `room_2` (southwest) are connected by `blue_door_1`
- `room_1` (northwest) and `room_3` (northeast) are connected by `blue_door_2`
- `room_2` (southwest) and `room_4` (southeast) are connected by `green_door_1`
- `room_3` (northeast) and `room_4` (southeast) are connected by `red_door_1`

Initial state:
- I am in `room_1` (northwest)
- `room_1` has `red_box_1`, `blue_ball_1`, and `purple_box_1`
- `room_2` has `purple_box_2`
- `room_3` has `yellow_box_1`, `green_box_1`, and `green_ball_1`
- `room_4` has `grey_box_1`
- All doors are locked
- I'm not holding any object
- I have visited `room_1`

Goal:
"There is a door d such that 'The following conditions are all true: d is red, you are in front of d, d is not locked'"

So the goal is to be in front of the red door (`red_door_1`) when it's unlocked.

Constraints:
1. At some point I must be in `room_1`
2. If I'm in `room_1`, then I must either be in front of `green_box_1` or have `blue_door_1` unlocked.

Let's think about the plan.

The red door (`red_door_1`) connects `room_3` and `room_4`. To unlock it, I need to:
1. Get to either `room_3` or `room_4`
2. Go in front of the red door
3. Toggle the red door to unlock it

But all doors are locked initially, so I need to find a way to move between rooms.

I start in `room_1`. From there, I need to:
1. Unlock `blue_door_1` to go to `room_2` or unlock `blue_door_2` to go to `room_3`
2. If I go to `room_2`, I would need to unlock `green_door_1` to get to `room_4`
3. If I go to `room_3`, I would need to unlock `red_door_1` to get to `room_4`

The direct path to the red door would be to go from `room_1` to `room_3` and then toggle the red door.

So let's work out a plan:
1. From `room_1`, go in front of `blue_door_2`
2. Toggle `blue_door_2` to unlock it
3. Go to `room_3` using `blue_door_2`
4. Go in front of `red_door_1`
5. Toggle `red_door_1` to unlock it
6. Now I'm in front of an unlocked red door, which is the goal.

But wait, there's a constraint: "If I'm in `room_1`, then I must either be in front of `green_box_1` or have `blue_door_1` unlocked."

However, `green_box_1` is in `room_3`, so I can't be in front of it while in `room_1`. So to satisfy this constraint, I need to unlock `blue_door_1`.

So the revised plan would be:
1. From `room_1`, go in front of `blue_door_1`
2. Toggle `blue_door_1` to unlock it (this satisfies the constraint)
3. Go in front of `blue_door_2`
4. Toggle `blue_door_2` to unlock it
5. Go to `room_3` using `blue_door_2`
6. Go in front of `red_door_1`
7. Toggle `red_door_1` to unlock it
8. Now I'm in front of an unlocked red door, which is the goal.

Let's now translate this into the specific actions using the domain's action language:

1. `gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2` - Go in front of `blue_door_1` which connects `room_1` and `room_2`.
2. `toggle blue_door_1` - Unlock `blue_door_1`. This satisfies the constraint because now `blue_door_1` is not locked.
3. `gotodoor blue_door_2 room_1 room_3` - Go in front of `blue_door_2` which connects `room_1` and `room_3`.
4. `toggle blue_door_2` - Unlock `blue_door_2`.
5. `gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_2` - Go to `room_3` from `room_1` using `blue_door_2`.
6. `gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_4` - Go in front of `red_door_1` which connects `room_3` and `room_4`.
7. `toggle red_door_1` - Unlock `red_door_1`.

Now let's double check to make sure this plan satisfies the problem:
- I start in `room_1`
- I unlock `blue_door_1` while in `room_1`, satisfying the constraint
- I end up in front of an unlocked red door, which is the goal.

It seems correct. However, there's an additional constraint that says "you have visited room_1" in the initial state. This is already satisfied since I start in `room_1`, so no additional actions are needed for this.

Let's make sure I didn't miss anything:
1. The goal is to be in front of an unlocked red door.
2. There's a constraint that while in `room_1`, I must either be in front of `green_box_1` or have `blue_door_1` unlocked.
3. I start in `room_1`.

The plan satisfies these conditions, so it should be valid.

Let's double-check my plan once more:

1. `gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2` - Go in front of `blue_door_1` which connects `room_1` and `room_2`.
2. `toggle blue_door_1` - Unlock `blue_door_1`.
3. `gotodoor blue_door_2 room_1 room_3` - Go in front of `blue_door_2` which connects `room_1` and `room_3`.
4. `toggle blue_door_2` - Unlock `blue_door_2`.
5. `gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_2` - Go to `room_3` from `room_1` using `blue_door_2`.
6. `gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_4` - Go in front of `red_door_1` which connects `room_3` and `room_4`.
7. `toggle red_door_1` - Unlock `red_door_1`.

This plan should achieve the goal of being in front of an unlocked red door.

Actually, hold on. Let me rethink this, to make sure I understand the constraint correctly. The constraint says:

"If expression 'you are in room_1' holds in some state s, then expression 'At least one of the following conditions is true: you are in front of green_box_1, blue_door_1 is not locked' must hold at s or at some state after s"

This means that once I'm in `room_1`, I must, at some point, either be in front of `green_box_1` or unlock `blue_door_1`. Now, `green_box_1` is in `room_3`, so I can't be in front of it while in `room_1`. So, the only way to satisfy this constraint is to unlock `blue_door_1`.

I'm already in `room_1` at the start. So at some point, I need to satisfy the condition of unlocking `blue_door_1`. This is part of my plan, so it seems correct.

However, let me re-read the goal:

"There is a door d such that 'The following conditions are all true: d is red, you are in front of d, d is not locked'"

I've previously identified this as `red_door_1`, but I should check the descriptions to make sure it's indeed red.

From the problem description: `"red_door_1 is red"`. So `red_door_1` is indeed the red door.

So our plan is to go to `red_door_1`, which is the door connecting `room_3` and `room_4`, and toggle it to unlock it. But I first need to get out of `room_1` and into `room_3`. I need to unlock `blue_door_2` for this. Additionally, there's a constraint that if I'm in `room_1`, I need to either be in front of `green_box_1` (which is in `room_3`) or have `blue_door_1` unlocked. So, while in `room_1`, I will also unlock `blue_door_1`.

So my final plan is:

1. `gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2` - Go in front of `blue_door_1` which connects `room_1` and `room_2`.
2. `toggle blue_door_1` - Unlock `blue_door_1`.
3. `gotodoor blue_door_2 room_1 room_3` - Go in front of `blue_door_2` which connects `room_1` and `room_3`.
4. `toggle blue_door_2` - Unlock `blue_door_2`.
5. `gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_2` - Go to `room_3` from `room_1` using `blue_door_2`.
6. `gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_4` - Go in front of `red_door_1` which connects `room_3` and `room_4`.
7. `toggle red_door_1` - Unlock `red_door_1`.

I believe this plan is optimal and satisfies all constraints.

Hmm, I'm rethinking this. Let's take the constraint:

"If expression 'you are in room_1' holds in some state s, then expression 'At least one of the following conditions is true: you are in front of green_box_1, blue_door_1 is not locked' must hold at s or at some state after s"

Since we start in `room_1`, this means that, from the initial state, we must at some point either be in front of `green_box_1` or have `blue_door_1` unlocked. Given that `green_box_1` is not in `room_1`, we need to unlock `blue_door_1`.

So the constraint is indeed satisfied by our plan.

Let me now ensure that the plan is in the correct format as specified:
1. `gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2`
2. `toggle blue_door_1`
3. `gotodoor blue_door_2 room_1 room_3`
4. `toggle blue_door_2`
5. `gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_2`
6. `gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_4`
7. `toggle red_door_1`

I believe this is the correct and optimal plan.

Actually, I don't actually need to unlock `blue_door_1`, I just need to be in front of `green_box_1` at some point after being in `room_1`. Since we also know that `green_box_1` is in `room_3`, let's update our plan:

1. `gotodoor blue_door_2 room_1 room_3` - Go in front of `blue_door_2` which connects `room_1` and `room_3`.
2. `toggle blue_door_2` - Unlock `blue_door_2`.
3. `gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_2` - Go to `room_3` from `room_1` using `blue_door_2`.
4. `gotoobject green_box_1 room_3` - Go in front of `green_box_1` in `room_3`. (This satisfies the constraint)
5. `gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_4` - Go in front of `red_door_1` which connects `room_3` and `room_4`.
6. `toggle red_door_1` - Unlock `red_door_1`.

But this doesn't quite match the constraint description. The constraint says:

"If expression 'you are in room_1' holds in some state s, then expression 'At least one of the following conditions is true: you are in front of green_box_1, blue_door_1 is not locked' must hold at s or at some state after s"

This means that if I'm in `room_1` at state s, then either:
1. In state s, I'm in front of `green_box_1`.
2. In state s, `blue_door_1` is not locked.
3. In some state after s, I'm in front of `green_box_1`.
4. In some state after s, `blue_door_1` is not locked.

Since `green_box_1` is in `room_3`, it's impossible to be in `room_1` and in front of `green_box_1` at the same time. So, options 1 and 3 are not possible. Thus, I must ensure that at some point, `blue_door_1` is not locked.

Actually wait, I'm confusing myself. Let me re-read the constraint:

"If expression 'you are in room_1' holds in some state s, then expression 'At least one of the following conditions is true: you are in front of green_box_1, blue_door_1 is not locked' must hold at s or at some state after s"

This means that if we are in `room_1` at some state s, then either (1) at the same state s or (2) at some state after s, either (a) I'm in front of `green_box_1` or (b) `blue_door_1` is unlocked.

Now, reading the object information again, I see that `green_box_1` is in `room_3`, not in `room_1`. So, if I'm in `room_1`, I can't be in front of `green_box_1`. Therefore, the only way to satisfy this constraint is to ensure that at some point after I'm in `room_1`, `blue_door_1` is unlocked.

Given that I start in `room_1`, I need to unlock `blue_door_1` at some point.

Revised plan:
1. `gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2` - Go in front of `blue_door_1` which connects `room_1` and `room_2`.
2. `toggle blue_door_1` - Unlock `blue_door_1`.
3. `gotodoor blue_door_2 room_1 room_3` - Go in front of `blue_door_2` which connects `room_1` and `room_3`.
4. `toggle blue_door_2` - Unlock `blue_door_2`.
5. `gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_2` - Go to `room_3` from `room_1` using `blue_door_2`.
6. `gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_4` - Go in front of `red_door_1` which connects `room_3` and `room_4`.
7. `toggle red_door_1` - Unlock `red_door_1`.

I think this version of the plan is optimal and satisfies all constraints.

Actually you know what, I'm thinking about this constraint once more:

"If expression 'you are in room_1' holds in some state s, then expression 'At least one of the following conditions is true: you are in front of green_box_1, blue_door_1 is not locked' must hold at s or at some state after s"

I've been interpreting this as saying that once we're in `room_1`, we must, at some point, either be in front of `green_box_1` or have `blue_door_1` be unlocked. But on a closer reading, it's saying that as long as we're in `room_1`, at least one of the two conditions must be true in that state or any subsequent state.

Given that we start in `room_1` and given that `green_box_1` is in `room_3`, we cannot be in front of it while in `room_1`. Therefore, to satisfy the constraint, I must ensure that `blue_door_1` is unlocked at some point after starting.

The previous plan does exactly this, so I still think it's optimal:

1. `gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2` - Go in front of `blue_door_1` which connects `room_1` and `room_2`.
2. `toggle blue_door_1` - Unlock `blue_door_1`.
3. `gotodoor blue_door_2 room_1 room_3` - Go in front of `blue_door_2` which connects `room_1` and `room_3`.
4. `toggle blue_door_2` - Unlock `blue_door_2`.
5. `gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_2` - Go to `room_3` from `room_1` using `blue_door_2`.
6. `gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_4` - Go in front of `red_door_1` which connects `room_3` and `room_4`.
7. `toggle red_door_1` - Unlock `red_door_1`.

Hmm, now I've reread the constraint multiple times, I wonder if a clearer interpretation is that we're only bound by the constraint while in `room_1`. That is, we're only required to either be in front of `green_box_1` or have `blue_door_1` unlocked when we're in `room_1`.

Rereading the constraint:

"If expression 'you are in room_1' holds in some state s, then expression 'At least one of the following conditions is true: you are in front of green_box_1, blue_door_1 is not locked' must hold at s or at some state after s"

This says that if we're in `room_1` at state s, then at state s or some state after s, one of the conditions must hold. It doesn't explicitly say the constraint only applies while we're in `room_1`. If we're in `room_1` at state s, the constraint applies to s and all subsequent states, regardless of whether we remain in `room_1` or not.

So, I still believe the optimal plan is to unlock `blue_door_1` and then proceed to unlock `red_door_1` as previously described.

1. `gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2` - Go in front of `blue_door_1` which connects `room_1` and `room_2`.
2. `toggle blue_door_1` - Unlock `blue_door_1`.
3. `gotodoor blue_door_2 room_1 room_3` - Go in front of `blue_door_2` which connects `room_1` and `room_3`.
4. `toggle blue_door_2` - Unlock `blue_door_2`.
5. `gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_2` - Go to `room_3` from `room_1` using `blue_door_2`.
6. `gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_4` - Go in front of `red_door_1` which connects `room_3` and `room_4`.
7. `toggle red_door_1` - Unlock `red_door_1`.

I think this is the right interpretation and the optimal plan.

Actually, let me think about the constraint from a temporal logic perspective:

"If expression 'you are in room_1' holds in some state s, then expression 'At least one of the following conditions is true: you are in front of green_box_1, blue_door_1 is not locked' must hold at s or at some state after s"

This seems like an LTL (Linear Temporal Logic) statement, which can be interpreted as:
G(in(`room_1`) → F(in_front_of(`green_box_1`) ∨ ¬locked(`blue_door_1`)))

In plain terms, this means that globally (for all states), if you are in `room_1`, then eventually (at that state or a future state), you are either in front of `green_box_1` or `blue_door_1` is not locked.

Since we start in `room_1`, we need to ensure that either we are in front of `green_box_1` or `blue_door_1` is not locked at some point (including the initial state). Since `green_box_1` is in `room_3`, we can't be in front of it in the initial state. And the problem states that all doors are locked, so `blue_door_1` is locked. This means that the constraint is not satisfied in the initial state.

Hence, I need to ensure that at some point in the future, either I am in front of `green_box_1` or `blue_door_1` is not locked. Since `green_box_1` is in `room_3` and we start in `room_1`, I would need to move to `room_3` to be in front of `green_box_1`. But to get to `room_3` from `room_1`, I need to go through `blue_door_2`, which is locked. So I'd first need to unlock `blue_door_2`.

So, the plan would be:
1. Unlock `blue_door_2` to go to `room_3`.
2. Either go in front of `green_box_1` in `room_3` or unlock `blue_door_1` while in `room_1`.
3. Go in front of `red_door_1` and unlock it.

Given the constraint, it seems that unlocking `blue_door_1` is the easiest way to satisfy it, since I'm already in `room_1`. Then, I can unlock `blue_door_2` to go to `room_3`, and finally unlock `red_door_1`.

This is indeed the plan I've been proposing:

1. `gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2` - Go in front of `blue_door_1` which connects `room_1` and `room_2`.
2. `toggle blue_door_1` - Unlock `blue_door_1`.
3. `gotodoor blue_door_2 room_1 room_3` - Go in front of `blue_door_2` which connects `room_1` and `room_3`.
4. `toggle blue_door_2` - Unlock `blue_door_2`.
5. `gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_2` - Go to `room_3` from `room_1` using `blue_door_2`.
6. `gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_4` - Go in front of `red_door_1` which connects `room_3` and `room_4`.
7. `toggle red_door_1` - Unlock `red_door_1`.

I believe this is the correct and optimal plan.

Actually, wait. Earlier I said `green_box_1` is in `room_3`, but we need to double-check this from the initial conditions.

From the problem description: `"green_box_1 is in room_3"`.

So `green_box_1` is indeed in `room_3`. And since the constraint says we need to either be in front of `green_box_1` or have `blue_door_1` unlocked, we can either:
1. Unlock `blue_door_1` while in `room_1`.
2. Go to `room_3` and stand in front of `green_box_1`.

I can't immediately go to room_3 from room_1 because the doors are locked. So I'd need to first unlock a door to get to `room_3`. Given this, unlocking `blue_door_1` while still in `room_1` seems like the more direct approach to satisfy the constraint.

But wait, I just realized: if the constraint means that once we're in `room_1`, at some point (in that state or a future state), we need to be in front of `green_box_1` or have `blue_door_1` unlocked, then I can satisfy this by going to `room_3` and standing in front of `green_box_1` after unlocking the necessary doors.

So, the plan could also be:
1. `gotodoor blue_door_2 room_1 room_3` - Go in front of `blue_door_2` which connects `room_1` and `room_3`.
2. `toggle blue_door_2` - Unlock `blue_door_2`.
3. `gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_2` - Go to `room_3` from `room_1` using `blue_door_2`.
4. `gotoobject green_box_1 room_3` - Go in front of `green_box_1` in `room_3`. This satisfies the constraint.
5. `gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_4` - Go in front of `red_door_1` which connects `room_3` and `room_4`.
6. `toggle red_door_1` - Unlock `red_door_1`.

This is a shorter plan, with just 6 steps. Since the problem states that we need an optimal plan, I should check if this plan is shorter.

But wait, I was concerned earlier because I didn't think I could be in room_1 and in front of green_box_1 at the same time, since green_box_1 is in room_3. But the constraint doesn't say that; it says that if we're in `room_1` at state s, then at state s or some state after s, we need to be in front of `green_box_1` or have `blue_door_1` unlocked.

So, I can be in `room_1` at state s and then later, after I've moved to `room_3`, I can be in front of `green_box_1` at some state s' > s. This would satisfy the constraint.

In that case, the plan to go to `room_3` and stand in front of `green_box_1` would be optimal, as it has fewer steps.

So, the optimal plan should be:
1. `gotodoor blue_door_2 room_1 room_3` - Go in front of `blue_door_2` which connects `room_1` and `room_3`.
2. `toggle blue_door_2` - Unlock `blue_door_2`.
3. `gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_2` - Go to `room_3` from `room_1` using `blue_door_2`.
4. `gotoobject green_box_1 room_3` - Go in front of `green_box_1` in `room_3`. This satisfies the constraint.
5. `gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_4` - Go in front of `red_door_1` which connects `room_3` and `room_4`.
6. `toggle red_door_1` - Unlock `red_door_1`.

I believe this is the optimal plan to achieve the goal while satisfying the constraint.

Actually wait. One second. Let me think about the constraint once more.

"If expression 'you are in room_1' holds in some state s, then expression 'At least one of the following conditions is true: you are in front of green_box_1, blue_door_1 is not locked' must hold at s or at some state after s"

This means that if I'm in `room_1` at state s, then at that same state s or at a future state s', I must either be in front of `green_box_1` or have `blue_door_1` unlocked.

Since I start in `room_1`, I must, at some point, either be in front of `green_box_1` or have `blue_door_1` unlocked. And given that `green_box_1` is in `room_3`, it's clear that if I want to be in front of `green_box_1`, I need to first unlock `blue_door_2` (to go to `room_3`), then go to `room_3`, and then move to stand in front of `green_box_1`.

Alternatively, I can just unlock `blue_door_1` while I'm in `room_1`.

For the sake of optimality, let's compare the two approaches:

Approach 1 (Unlocking `blue_door_1`):
1. `gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2`
2. `toggle blue_door_1` (This satisfies the constraint)
3. `gotodoor blue_door_2 room_1 room_3`
4. `toggle blue_door_2`
5. `gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_2`
6. `gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_4`
7. `toggle red_door_1`

Approach 2 (Going to `green_box_1`):
1. `gotodoor blue_door_2 room_1 room_3`
2. `toggle blue_door_2`
3. `gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_2`
4. `gotoobject green_box_1 room_3` (This satisfies the constraint)
5. `gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_4`
6. `toggle red_door_1`

Approach 2 is shorter, with 6 steps, compared to Approach 1, which has 7 steps. So, Approach 2 seems more optimal.

Actually, wait. I'm reconsidering the constraint:

"If expression 'you are in room_1' holds in some state s, then expression 'At least one of the following conditions is true: you are in front of green_box_1, blue_door_1 is not locked' must hold at s or at some state after s"

I think I've been overthinking this. This simply means that if I'm in room_1 at some point, then at that point or later, I must either be in front of `green_box_1` or have `blue_door_1` unlocked.

Since I start in `room_1`, this constraint immediately applies. And given the initial conditions, I'm neither in front of `green_box_1` nor is `blue_door_1` unlocked. So, I must make one of these true at some point to satisfy the constraint.

The optimality condition means I should choose the approach that requires fewer steps. From the two approaches I've outlined, Approach 2 (going to `green_box_1`) requires fewer steps.

So, the optimal plan is:
1. `gotodoor blue_door_2 room_1 room_3` - Go in front of `blue_door_2` which connects `room_1` and `room_3`.
2. `toggle blue_door_2` - Unlock `blue_door_2`.
3. `gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_2` - Go to `room_3` from `room_1` using `blue_door_2`.
4. `gotoobject green_box_1 room_3` - Go in front of `green_box_1` in `room_3`. This satisfies the constraint.
5. `gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_4` - Go in front of `red_door_1` which connects `room_3` and `room_4`.
6. `toggle red_door_1` - Unlock `red_door_1`.

I believe this is the optimal plan to achieve the goal while satisfying the constraint.

Actually, hold on. I just realized there's a "meta" constraint from the problem: "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'you are in room_1'"

But, I already start in `room_1`, so I think I already by default satisfy that constraint. Let me re-read it to be sure.

"The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'you are in room_1'"

Yes, this constraint is trivially satisfied because I start in `room_1`. So, this doesn't introduce any additional considerations.

So, my optimal plan remains:
1. `gotodoor blue_door_2 room_1 room_3` - Go in front of `blue_door_2` which connects `room_1` and `room_3`.
2. `toggle blue_door_2` - Unlock `blue_door_2`.
3. `gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_2` - Go to `room_3` from `room_1` using `blue_door_2`.
4. `gotoobject green_box_1 room_3` - Go in front of `green_box_1` in `room_3`. This satisfies the constraint.
5. `gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_4` - Go in front of `red_door_1` which connects `room_3` and `room_4`.
6. `toggle red_door_1` - Unlock `red_door_1`.

I believe this is the optimal plan to achieve the goal while satisfying the constraint.
