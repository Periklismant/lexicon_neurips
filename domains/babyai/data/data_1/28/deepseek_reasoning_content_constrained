Okay, let's see. The goal is to be in front of a red door that's unlocked. The initial state has all doors locked. The constraints require that I must be in room_1 at least once, and whenever I'm in room_1, either I'm in front of green_box_1 or blue_door_1 is unlocked at that state or later.

First, I need to figure out which doors are red. Looking at the doors: red_door_1 is red. red_door_1 connects room_3 and room_4. So the target door is red_door_1. So I need to get in front of red_door_1 and have it unlocked.

But all doors start locked. So I need to toggle red_door_1. To toggle a door, I have to be in front of it. So I need to reach red_door_1 and unlock it.

But how do I get there? Starting in room_1. The doors from room_1 are blue_door_1 (to room_2) and blue_door_2 (to room_3). Both are locked. So I can't go through them unless I unlock them. But to unlock them, I need to toggle them, which requires being in front of them. But since they are in room_1, I can go to them if there's nothing blocking. Wait, the preconditions for "gotodoor" say that I can go to a door if I'm in a room connected by that door and no object is blocking the position in front of the door in the current room.

So in room_1, the doors are blue_door_1 and blue_door_2. Are there objects blocking their positions? The initial state says that in room_1, there's red_box_1, blue_ball_1, and purple_box_1. If any of these are in front of the doors, then the doors are blocked. But how do I know where the objects are positioned? The problem description doesn't specify exact positions, only the rooms. So maybe the default is that objects are not blocking doors unless stated otherwise. So maybe the doors aren't blocked, so I can go to them.

Wait, but the problem says "there is no object blocking the position in front of d in the room you are currently in." So I need to check if any object is blocking that spot. Since the problem doesn't specify positions, perhaps we can assume that the initial positions of objects are not in front of doors. Therefore, I can go to the doors in room_1.

So first, go to blue_door_1 in room_1. Then toggle it to unlock. Then go through blue_door_1 to room_2. But room_2 has purple_box_2. From room_2, the doors are blue_door_1 (back to room_1) and green_door_1 to room_4. But green_door_1 is locked. Alternatively, maybe go through blue_door_2 to room_3. Let's see.

Wait, blue_door_2 connects room_1 and room_3. So if I can unlock blue_door_2, then I can go to room_3. But to unlock blue_door_2, I need to be in front of it in room_1, then toggle it. So steps could be:

1. goto door blue_door_1 room_1 room_2 (since I'm in room_1)
But wait, the gotodoor action is "gotodoor d r1 r2" where r1 and r2 are the rooms connected by d. But the syntax for gotodoor is "gotodoor d r1 r2". So for blue_door_1, which connects room_1 and room_2, in room_1, I can do gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2. Then toggle it.

But after that, I can go through blue_door_1 to room_2. Then in room_2, there's green_door_1 connecting to room_4. But green_door_1 is locked. So to unlock that, I need to toggle it. But how? To toggle green_door_1, I need to be in front of it in room_2. But if there's no object blocking, then I can go to it. Then toggle it, then go to room_4.

In room_4, there's grey_box_1. From room_4, the doors are green_door_1 (to room_2) and red_door_1 (to room_3). Red_door_1 is red, which is the target door. So if I can get to room_4, then go to red_door_1 in room_4, toggle it to unlock, then be in front of it. But red_door_1 connects room_3 and room_4, so to get to it from room_4, I can go to the door, toggle it, then be in front of it unlocked.

But how do I reach room_4? Let's outline the possible path:

Starting in room_1. Need to unlock a door to leave. Let's try unlocking blue_door_2 first. Because room_3 has the green_ball_1 and other boxes, but maybe going through room_3 to room_4 via red_door_1.

Wait, red_door_1 connects room_3 and room_4. So from room_3, if I can unlock red_door_1, then I can go to room_4. But red_door_1 is initially locked. So to unlock it, I need to be in front of it in either room_3 or room_4.

Alternatively, if I can get to room_3 via blue_door_2 (from room_1), then go to red_door_1 in room_3, unlock it, then go to room_4. Then in room_4, I can be in front of red_door_1 (since it connects to room_3, so in room_4, the door is there). Wait, the doors are two-way. So red_door_1 is in both room_3 and room_4. But to be in front of it in room_4, I need to be in room_4. So maybe the plan is:

1. From room_1, go to blue_door_2 (connecting to room_3). But blue_door_2 is locked. So first, goto door blue_door_2 room_1 room_3, then toggle it to unlock. Then go through blue_door_2 to room_3. Then in room_3, go to red_door_1 (connecting to room_4), toggle it to unlock, then go to room_4. Then in room_4, goto door red_door_1 room_4 room_3, then since it's unlocked, I can be in front of it, and the goal is satisfied: red_door_1 is red, I'm in front of it, and it's unlocked.

But let's check the steps:

- Start in room_1.

- gotodoor blue_door_2 room_1 room_3 (since I'm in room_1, blue_door_2 connects room_1 and room_3). Then toggle blue_door_2 (unlock it). Then gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_2. Now I'm in room_3.

In room_3, need to unlock red_door_1. So gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_4. Then toggle to unlock. Then gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_1. Now in room_4. Then gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_3. Now in front of red_door_1 in room_4, which is red, and it's unlocked. So that satisfies the goal.

But wait, the goal is "there exists a door d such that d is red, you are in front of d, and d is not locked". So in room_4, after unlocking red_door_1, being in front of it satisfies the goal.

But let's check constraints. The first constraint is that in at least one state, you are in room_1. The initial state already has you in room_1 and you've visited it, so that's satisfied. The second constraint is that whenever you are in room_1 in any state s, then either you are in front of green_box_1 or blue_door_1 is not locked at s or after. So during the plan, if you ever return to room_1 after leaving, you have to ensure that either you are in front of green_box_1 (which is in room_3) or blue_door_1 becomes unlocked. But in the plan I outlined above, after leaving room_1 initially, do we return? No. So the initial state already satisfies being in room_1 once, and the constraint is met because in that state, we were in room_1, and the subsequent actions don't require us to go back. So that's okay. But wait, the constraint says that if you are in room_1 in some state s, then the condition must hold in s or after. Since the initial state is room_1, and in that state, the condition requires that either you are in front of green_box_1 (which is in room_3, so not possible here) or blue_door_1 is not locked. But in the initial state, blue_door_1 is locked. So the constraint would be violated unless, after the initial state, in some subsequent state, blue_door_1 becomes unlocked.

Wait, the constraint is a bit tricky. It says, if in any state s, you are in room_1, then either in s or some state after s, the condition (front of green_box_1 or blue_door_1 unlocked) must hold. Since the initial state is s where you are in room_1. So in the initial state s, the condition must hold in s or after. In s (initial state), you are in room_1. Are you in front of green_box_1? No. Is blue_door_1 unlocked? No. So the condition is not met in s. Therefore, in some state after s, the condition must hold. So either later, you go back to room_1 and then in that state or after, the condition is met, or during the plan, after leaving room_1, blue_door_1 is unlocked at some point.

In the initial plan I thought of, we only unlock blue_door_2 and red_door_1. So blue_door_1 remains locked. Therefore, the constraint would be violated because in the initial state, which is in room_1, the condition is not met then or after. So to satisfy the constraint, after the initial state, the agent must at some point unlock blue_door_1, which would make the condition hold (blue_door_1 is not locked) in some state after the initial s.

Therefore, the plan needs to include unlocking blue_door_1. But how? Let's adjust the plan.

Alternative approach: Unlock blue_door_1 first. Then that satisfies the constraint.

So steps:

1. In room_1, goto door blue_door_1 (room_1 to room_2). Since there's red_box_1, blue_ball_1, purple_box_1 in room_1. Are they blocking the door? The problem says "if there is no object blocking the position in front of d in the current room." Since the initial state doesn't mention any object blocking doors, perhaps we can assume that the doors are not blocked. So:

Action: gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2

Then toggle blue_door_1 (unlock it). Now blue_door_1 is unlocked. Then, the constraint is satisfied because after the initial state (where we were in room_1), blue_door_1 becomes unlocked in a subsequent state. So the constraint is met.

Then, proceed to go through blue_door_1 to room_2. From room_2, there's green_door_1 leading to room_4. Unlock green_door_1:

In room_2, gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4. Toggle it to unlock. Then go to room_4. From room_4, there's red_door_1 connecting to room_3. Unlock red_door_1:

In room_4, gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_3. Toggle to unlock. Now, being in front of red_door_1 in room_4, which is red and unlocked. So the goal is achieved.

But let's outline the steps:

1. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2

2. toggle blue_door_1

Now, blue_door_1 is unlocked, satisfying the constraint. Then:

3. gotoroom room_1 room_2 blue_door_1

Now in room_2.

4. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4

5. toggle green_door_1

6. gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1

Now in room_4.

7. gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_3

8. toggle red_door_1 (unlocks it)

Now, in front of red_door_1 (red), which is unlocked. So the goal is achieved.

This plan satisfies the constraints because:

- The initial state is in room_1. Then, in the first action, we are in room_1 and go to blue_door_1. Then toggle it (action 2), which unlocks it. So after action 2, blue_door_1 is unlocked. Therefore, in the initial state s (room_1), the condition that "blue_door_1 is not locked" holds in a state after s (after action 2). Thus, the constraint is satisfied.

Now, let's check if each action's preconditions are met.

Action 1: gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2. Preconditions: in a room connected by blue_door_1 (yes, room_1), and no object blocking the door's position in room_1. Assuming no blocking objects, so allowed.

Action 2: toggle blue_door_1. Precondition: must be in front of it. After action 1, the agent is in front of blue_door_1.

Action 3: gotoroom room_1 room_2 blue_door_1. Preconditions: current room is room_1 (yes), adjacent to room_2 (connected via blue_door_1), and door is unlocked (now yes, after action 2). So allowed.

Action 4: gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4. Preconditions: in room_2 (yes), door connects to room_4. Check if any object blocks the door in room_2. Room_2 has purple_box_2. But unless it's blocking, which we don't know. Assuming it's not blocking. So allowed.

Action 5: toggle green_door_1. Precondition: in front of it. After action 4, yes.

Action 6: gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1. Door is now unlocked (after action 5). So allowed.

Action 7: gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_3. In room_4, connected via red_door_1. No objects blocking (room_4 has grey_box_1, but assuming not in front of door).

Action 8: toggle red_door_1. Now, in front of it, so allowed. After toggling, it's unlocked.

Now, the agent is in front of red_door_1 (red, unlocked), which satisfies the goal.

This plan has 8 actions. Is there a shorter plan?

Alternative: Maybe after unlocking blue_door_1, instead of going to room_2, go to room_3 via blue_door_2. But blue_door_2 is locked. Wait, in the initial plan, we only unlocked blue_door_1. To go to room_3, we need to unlock blue_door_2. Let's see:

Alternative plan:

1. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2, toggle, then unlock.

2. Then, instead of going to room_2, go to blue_door_2 in room_1, unlock it.

Wait, but initially, blue_door_2 is locked. So steps:

1. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2, toggle (unlock). Now blue_door_1 is unlocked.

2. gotodoor blue_door_2 room_1 room_3, toggle (unlock). Now blue_door_2 is unlocked.

Then go to room_3 via blue_door_2.

In room_3, unlock red_door_1 and go to room_4. Then be in front of red_door_1.

But this requires more steps. Let's count:

1. goto blue_door_1, toggle (actions 1-2)

2. goto blue_door_2, toggle (actions 3-4)

3. gotoroom room_1 to room_3 via blue_door_2 (action5)

4. goto red_door_1 in room_3, toggle (actions6-7)

5. gotoroom room3 to room4 via red_door_1 (action8)

6. goto red_door_1 in room4 (action9)

So this is longer. The previous plan was 8 actions, this is 9. So the first plan is better.

But wait, in the first plan, after unlocking blue_door_1, we go to room2, then to room4 via green_door_1, then unlock red_door_1. That's 8 actions. So that's better.

Another alternative: From room_1, unlock blue_door_2, go to room3, unlock red_door_1 there, then go to room4. But to unlock blue_door_2, you have to be in room_1. So:

1. goto blue_door_2 in room1, toggle (unlock)

2. go to room3

3. goto red_door_1 in room3, toggle (unlock)

4. go to room4

5. goto red_door_1 in room4, done.

But the constraint requires that if you are in room_1 at any point (which you are in the initial state), then in that state or after, blue_door_1 is unlocked or you're in front of green_box_1. Since in this plan, blue_door_1 remains locked, the constraint is violated. So this plan wouldn't satisfy the constraint. Thus, this approach is invalid.

Therefore, the first plan is necessary to unlock blue_door_1 to satisfy the constraint.

So the valid plan must include unlocking blue_door_1.

Therefore, the optimal plan is the first one I thought of: unlock blue_door_1, go through to room2, unlock green_door_1, go to room4, unlock red_door_1, and be in front of it.

Now, checking all preconditions again.

Action 1: gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2. Preconditions: in room_1 (yes), door connects to room_2 (yes), no object blocking (assuming yes). Valid.

Action 2: toggle blue_door_1. Precondition: in front of it. After action1, yes. Valid.

Action3: gotoroom room_1 room_2 blue_door_1. Pre: in room_1 (yes), adjacent via blue_door_1 (yes), door unlocked (now yes). Valid.

Action4: gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4. Pre: in room_2 (yes), door connects to room_4 (yes), no blocking. Valid.

Action5: toggle green_door_1. Pre: in front. Valid.

Action6: gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1. Pre: room2 adjacent to room4, door unlocked. Valid.

Action7: gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_3. Pre: in room4, door connects to room3, no blocking. Valid.

Action8: toggle red_door_1. Pre: in front. Valid.

Now, after action8, the agent is in front of red_door_1 (room4), which is red and unlocked. So the goal is achieved.

Now, check the constraints:

- The initial state has the agent in room_1, which satisfies the first constraint (at least one state in room_1).

- For the second constraint: any state where the agent is in room_1 must have the condition met at that state or after. The only such state is the initial state. In that state, the agent is not in front of green_box_1 (which is in room3), and blue_door_1 is locked. However, after the initial state, in action2, blue_door_1 is unlocked. Therefore, after the initial state, blue_door_1 becomes unlocked, satisfying the condition. So the constraint is met.

This plan has 8 actions. Can it be shorter?

Wait, after action7, when the agent is in front of red_door_1 in room4, after toggling (action8), they are in front of it, and the door is unlocked. So that's the goal. So the last action is toggle, which unlocks it. So that's necessary.

But maybe after action8, the agent is already in front of the door, so no need to do anything else. So the plan length is 8. Is there a way to have fewer steps?

Alternative path: From room4, after unlocking red_door_1, the agent is already in front of it. So action7 is gotodoor, action8 is toggle. So two actions. But that's necessary. So the plan is 8 steps.

Is there a shorter way? Let's see.

Another approach: After unlocking blue_door_1, can the agent directly go to room2, then room4 via green_door_1 (unlocking it), then room4's red_door_1. That's the same as before. So no shorter path.

Therefore, the plan of 8 steps is optimal.
