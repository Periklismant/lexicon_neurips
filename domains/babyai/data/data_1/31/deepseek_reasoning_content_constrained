Okay, let me try to figure this out step by step. The goal is to get in front of a blue door that's unlocked. But there are some constraints to consider. 

First, let's look at the initial state. The agent is in room_2. All doors are locked initially. The blue doors are blue_door_1 (connecting room_1 and room_3), blue_door_2 (connecting room_2 and room_4), and there's also purple_door_1 (room_1 and room_2) and yellow_door_1 (room_3 and room_4). All are locked.

The goal requires that there exists a blue door (d) where d is blue, the agent is in front of it, and it's not locked. So possible candidates are blue_door_1, blue_door_2. Both are locked initially. So we need to unlock one of them. But there's a constraint: blue_door_2 must be locked in at least one state. And if blue_door_2 is ever locked, then in that state or a later one, either blue_door_1 is unlocked or the agent is holding an object.

Wait, the constraints are that the expression "blue_door_2 is locked" must hold in at least one state. Since initially blue_door_2 is locked, that's already satisfied. But the second constraint says that whenever blue_door_2 is locked in some state s, then either blue_door_1 is not locked or the agent is holding something must be true in s or a later state. So since blue_door_2 starts locked, in that initial state, we need to check if either blue_door_1 is not locked (but it is locked initially) or the agent is holding something (they are not). So the initial state violates this constraint unless we take some action. Wait, no: the constraint says that if in any state s, blue_door_2 is locked, then in s or a subsequent state, either blue_door_1 is unlocked or the agent is holding something. So the initial state s0 has blue_door_2 locked. So in s0, we must check if either blue_door_1 is unlocked (no, it's locked) or the agent is holding something (no). Therefore, the constraint is violated unless in a subsequent state after s0, either blue_door_1 is unlocked or the agent is holding something. So the plan must ensure that after the initial state, at some point, either blue_door_1 is unlocked (i.e., toggled) or the agent picks up an object.

But the agent's goal is to have a blue door unlocked and be in front of it. Let's consider possible approaches.

Option 1: Unlock blue_door_1. To do that, the agent needs to be in front of it. But blue_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3. The agent is in room_2. To get to blue_door_1, they need to go through purple_door_1 (room_2 to room_1), but purple_door_1 is locked. So to unlock purple_door_1, the agent needs to be in front of it. But purple_door_1 is in room_2 (since it connects room_2 and room_1). Wait, the agent is in room_2. So can they go to the purple door in room_2?

Wait, the "gotodoor" action requires that you are in a room that the door connects. Since purple_door_1 connects room_1 and room_2, the agent is in room_2, so they can go to purple_door_1. But the preconditions for gotodoor: the agent must be in a room connected by the door, and there's no object blocking the position in front of the door in the current room.

Looking at the initial state, in room_2, the objects present are blue_ball_2 and red_ball_1. Are any of these blocking the door? The initial problem statement mentions that objects can block doors. Wait, in the initial state, are any objects blocking doors? The problem says "there are no objects blocking the position in front of d in the room you are currently in." Wait, the initial state doesn't mention any objects blocking doors, so perhaps all doors are unblocked. So the agent can go to purple_door_1 in room_2.

So steps could be:

1. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1. But purple_door_1 is locked. Then toggle it (unlock). Then go through to room_1. Then from room_1, go to blue_door_1 (which is in room_1, connecting to room_3). Toggle blue_door_1 to unlock it. Then go through to room_3. Then maybe proceed to unlock another door. But maybe there's a shorter path.

But the goal is to be in front of a blue door that's unlocked. So perhaps it's easier to unlock blue_door_2. Because blue_door_2 connects room_2 and room_4. The agent is already in room_2. If they can get to blue_door_2 in room_2, then toggle it (unlock), and then they're in front of it. But blue_door_2 is initially locked, so toggling it would unlock it, making it not locked. Then the goal is achieved.

But wait, the problem is that the agent needs to unlock a door. So steps would be: goto blue_door_2 in room_2, which requires the gotodoor action. Then toggle it (unlocking). Then the agent is in front of blue_door_2, which is now unlocked. That would satisfy the goal. But wait, the agent's position after toggling is still in front of the door. So the final state would have the agent in front of blue_door_2, which is unlocked. That meets the goal.

But let's check the constraints. The first constraint is that blue_door_2 must be locked in at least one state. Since initially it's locked, that's already true. The second constraint is that whenever blue_door_2 is locked in a state, then in that state or a later one, either blue_door_1 is unlocked or the agent is holding something. In the initial state s0, blue_door_2 is locked. So we need in s0 or a subsequent state, blue_door_1 is unlocked or agent is holding something. If our plan is to unlock blue_door_2, then during the plan, the agent would toggle blue_door_2 from locked to unlocked. But after that, blue_door_2 is unlocked. However, during the plan, the initial state s0 has blue_door_2 locked, and s0 is part of the plan. So the constraint applies here. So in s0, the agent is not holding anything, and blue_door_1 is locked. So that violates the constraint unless in a later state, the agent either holds something or blue_door_1 is unlocked.

Wait, the constraint says that if in any state s, blue_door_2 is locked, then in s or a subsequent state, either blue_door_1 is unlocked or agent is holding something. So in s0 (blue_door_2 is locked), the agent must ensure that either in s0, blue_door_1 is unlocked (which it's not) or agent is holding something (which they're not), or in a later state, one of those becomes true.

If the agent's plan is to go to blue_door_2, toggle it (unlocking), then the next state after toggle would have blue_door_2 unlocked. But between s0 and the toggle action, there's a state where blue_door_2 is still locked. Let's break it down:

Initial state (s0): blue_door_2 locked.

Action 1: gotodoor blue_door_2 room_2 room_4. Preconditions: agent is in room_2, which is connected via blue_door_2, and no object blocks the door in room_2. Since the initial state doesn't mention any objects blocking doors, this is allowed. So after this action, agent is in front of blue_door_2. Now, in state s1: still blue_door_2 is locked.

Action 2: toggle blue_door_2. Now, blue_door_2 becomes unlocked. State s2: blue_door_2 is unlocked.

But between s0 and s2, there's s1 where blue_door_2 is still locked. Wait, no. The action toggle changes the door's state. So after toggle, the door is unlocked. So in s1 (after gotodoor), the door is still locked. Then action toggle changes it to unlocked. So in the plan, the initial state is s0 (locked), then after gotodoor, s1 (still locked, because toggle hasn't happened yet), then after toggle, s2 (unlocked). So the constraint requires that in s0 or any state after s0 where blue_door_2 is locked (like s0 and s1), the condition must hold. So in s0: blue_door_2 is locked. So check if in s0 or after, blue_door_1 is unlocked or agent is holding something. In s0, neither is true. So we need that in some state after s0 (like s1 or s2), either blue_door_1 is unlocked or the agent is holding something.

But in the plan outlined so far (actions: gotodoor blue_door_2, toggle it), after toggling, the door is unlocked. But blue_door_1 remains locked. The agent isn't holding anything. So the constraint would be violated because during s0 and s1 (both states where blue_door_2 is locked), there's no subsequent state where blue_door_1 is unlocked or agent is holding something. Because after s2, blue_door_2 is unlocked, but the constraint applies to s0 and s1. So we need that for s0, there exists a state after s0 (including itself) where either blue_door_1 is unlocked or agent holds something.

So, in this plan, after s0, the agent performs gotodoor and toggle. But after toggle, they haven't done anything with blue_door_1 or picked up an object. So the constraint is not met. Therefore, this plan is invalid.

Thus, the agent must either unlock blue_door_1 or pick up an object at some point after s0.

So the plan must include an action where the agent either toggles blue_door_1 (unlocking it) or picks up an object.

But how can the agent get to blue_door_1? They are in room_2 initially. To reach blue_door_1 (which connects room_1 and room_3), the agent needs to go from room_2 to room_1 via purple_door_1, but purple_door_1 is locked. So to unlock purple_door_1, they need to be in front of it and toggle it. Then go through to room_1, then go to blue_door_1, unlock it, which would satisfy the constraint.

Alternatively, the agent could pick up an object. Let's see. In room_2, there are blue_ball_2 and red_ball_1. So the agent could pick one of them. But to pick, they need to be in front of the object. So steps would be: gotoobject blue_ball_2 room_2, pick it. Then drop it somewhere else. But if they pick it, then in the state where they are holding it, the constraint is satisfied for any state where blue_door_2 is locked (like s0 and s1). So maybe that's a way.

Let me outline a possible plan that satisfies the constraints:

1. gotoobject blue_ball_2 room_2 (agent is now in front of it)
2. pick blue_ball_2 room_2 (now holding it)
3. gotodoor blue_door_2 room_2 room_4 (agent moves to the door)
4. toggle blue_door_2 (unlock it)

Now, in this plan:

- The initial state s0: blue_door_2 locked, agent not holding anything. But the constraint requires that in s0, if blue_door_2 is locked, then in s0 or after, either blue_door_1 is unlocked or agent is holding something. In step 2, after picking, the agent is holding blue_ball_2. So between s0 and the end, after step 2, the agent is holding the object. Therefore, for s0 (blue_door_2 locked), there exists a subsequent state (step 2 onwards) where the agent is holding something, satisfying the constraint.

So let's check:

In step 1: agent is in front of blue_ball_2 in room_2.

Step 2: agent picks it up. Now, they are holding blue_ball_2.

Then, step 3: goto door blue_door_2 (room_2 to room_4). Since they are in room_2, can they go to the door? They need to have no object blocking. Assuming there's no blocking, yes.

Step 4: toggle the door (unlocking it). Now, agent is in front of blue_door_2, which is unlocked. This satisfies the goal.

Now, the constraints:

- The first constraint is that blue_door_2 is locked in at least one state. Initially, it is locked, and in step 3 (before toggle), it's still locked. So that's satisfied.

- The second constraint: whenever blue_door_2 is locked, in that state or after, either blue_door_1 is unlocked or agent is holding something. For the initial state (s0), after s0, the agent picks up the ball (step 2), so in that subsequent state, they are holding something. Thus, the constraint is satisfied. Also, during step 3 (after step 2), blue_door_2 is still locked, but the agent is holding the ball. So even in that state, the condition holds. Then, after step 4, the door is unlocked, so no longer part of the constraint.

This plan would work. Let me check the steps:

1. gotoobject blue_ball_2 room_2: possible since agent is in room_2 and the ball is there.

2. pick blue_ball_2 room_2: possible as agent is in front of it and not holding anything.

3. gotodoor blue_door_2 room_2 room_4: possible, as agent is in room_2, which is connected via blue_door_2, and no blocking object.

4. toggle blue_door_2: possible, as agent is in front of it. Now door is unlocked.

After this, the agent is in front of blue_door_2, which is unlocked, meeting the goal. The constraints are satisfied because in the initial state, blue_door_2 is locked, and in a later state (after step 2), the agent is holding the ball. Also, during step 3, when the agent is in front of the door and it's still locked, the agent is holding the ball, so the condition holds.

So this plan should work. Let's check if this is the optimal (shortest possible). The steps are four actions. Is there a shorter way?

Alternative approach: Can the agent just pick up an object first, then go to the door and toggle?

Yes. But let's see:

1. gotoobject blue_ball_2 room_2.

2. pick blue_ball_2 room_2.

3. gotodoor blue_door_2 room_2 room_4.

4. toggle blue_door_2.

Same as before. Four steps. That's four actions.

Alternatively, can they do it in three?

Suppose after picking up the ball, they go directly to the door and toggle. But the steps are still the same.

Alternatively, maybe there's a way without picking up. For example, unlock blue_door_1.

But that requires going to room_1, which is locked behind purple_door_1. To unlock purple_door_1, the agent needs to be in front of it in room_2. Let's try that:

1. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1.

2. toggle purple_door_1 (unlock).

3. gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1 (now in room_1).

4. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_3.

5. toggle blue_door_1 (unlock).

Now, the agent is in front of blue_door_1, which is blue and unlocked. This satisfies the goal. Now, check constraints.

The first constraint: blue_door_2 must be locked in at least one state. Initially, it is. So that's okay.

Second constraint: whenever blue_door_2 is locked, in that state or after, either blue_door_1 is unlocked or holding something. In this plan, after step 5, blue_door_1 is unlocked. So in the initial state (blue_door_2 locked), blue_door_1 is locked, but later steps unlock it. So in the initial state, the constraint is that there must be a subsequent state where blue_door_1 is unlocked (step 5). So the constraint is satisfied.

But this plan has 5 steps, which is longer than the previous one. So the first plan is shorter.

Alternatively, if the agent can unlock blue_door_2 directly, but ensuring the constraints.

Wait, the first plan I considered (pick up the ball, unlock blue_door_2) is four steps. The other approach is longer. So the optimal plan is the four-step one.

But let me check if there's a way to do it in three steps. For example:

1. gotodoor blue_door_2 room_2 room_4.

But blue_door_2 is locked. So agent can't go through, but they can go in front of it.

Wait, to toggle the door, they just need to be in front of it. So steps:

1. gotodoor blue_door_2 room_2 room_4.

2. toggle blue_door_2 (unlock).

But then, after step 2, the agent is in front of blue_door_2, which is now unlocked. That's two actions. But the problem is the constraint. Because in the initial state, blue_door_2 is locked. So we need that in the initial state or after, either blue_door_1 is unlocked or agent is holding something. But this two-step plan doesn't address that. Because in the initial state, neither condition holds. Then, after step 1 (gotodoor), the agent is in front of the door, but the door is still locked. Then step 2 (toggle) unlocks it. But between s0 and s1 (after step1), blue_door_2 is locked. So for s0 (blue_door_2 locked), we need that in s0 or after, either blue_door_1 is unlocked or agent is holding something. The two-step plan doesn't satisfy this, because after s0, the only subsequent state is s1 (after step1: blue_door_2 still locked, agent not holding anything, blue_door_1 still locked) and s2 (after step2: blue_door_2 unlocked). So in s0, the constraint isn't met because there's no step where after s0, the agent holds something or blue_door_1 is unlocked. Thus, this two-step plan violates the constraint. Therefore, we need to include an action that either unlocks blue_door_1 or picks up an object.

So the previous four-step plan is the shortest possible. Hence, the answer should be:

gotoobject blue_ball_2 room_2

pick blue_ball_2 room_2

gotodoor blue_door_2 room_2 room_4

toggle blue_door_2

But wait, after toggle, the agent is in front of blue_door_2, which is now unlocked, satisfying the goal. And the constraints are met because in the initial state, after s0, the agent picks up the ball (step 2), so they are holding something, which satisfies the second constraint.

Yes, that's the plan.
