```
gotoobject blue_ball_2 room_2
pick blue_ball_2 room_2
gotodoor blue_door_2 room_2 room_4
toggle blue_door_2
```
```
The plan achieves the goal by first picking up an object (blue_ball_2) to satisfy the constraint that whenever blue_door_2 is locked, the agent must be holding something in that or a subsequent state. After securing the constraint compliance, the agent moves to blue_door_2 (which remains locked until toggled) and unlocks it. This results in the agent being in front of a blue door (blue_door_2) that is unlocked, satisfying all requirements optimally in 4 steps.
