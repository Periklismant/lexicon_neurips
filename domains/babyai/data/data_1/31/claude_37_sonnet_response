Let me analyze this planning problem step by step.

First, I'll make sure I understand the initial state, the goal, and the constraints:

Initial state:
- I'm in room_2
- Several balls and boxes are distributed across the rooms
- All doors are locked
- I'm not holding any object
- Various objects and doors have colors as specified

Goal:
- Be in front of a blue door that is unlocked

Constraints:
1. At some point, blue_door_2 must be locked (this is satisfied in the initial state)
2. After blue_door_2 is locked at any state, either blue_door_1 must be unlocked OR I must be holding some object

Let me identify the blue doors:
- blue_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3
- blue_door_2 connects room_2 and room_4

Since I need to be in front of an unlocked blue door, I need to:
1. Go to a blue door (either blue_door_1 or blue_door_2)
2. Toggle it to unlock it
3. Be in front of it

Let's think about how to satisfy the constraints:
- Initially, blue_door_2 is locked, satisfying the first constraint
- But after that state, I need to either unlock blue_door_1 or hold an object to satisfy the second constraint

Since the goal involves being in front of an unlocked blue door anyway, let me try to unlock a blue door.

I start in room_2, and blue_door_2 is accessible from room_2, connecting to room_4. Let me try to go to blue_door_2, toggle it to unlock it, and then I'll be in front of an unlocked blue door, achieving the goal.

Let's plan the actions:
1. gotodoor blue_door_2 room_2 room_4 - Go in front of blue_door_2 from room_2
2. toggle blue_door_2 - Unlock blue_door_2

Wait, I need to check if this satisfies the constraints. 
- Initially, blue_door_2 is locked
- After I toggle it, it becomes unlocked
- But constraint 2 requires that after blue_door_2 is locked, either blue_door_1 is unlocked or I'm holding an object

Since I'm unlocking blue_door_2, I need to make sure either blue_door_1 is unlocked or I'm holding an object. Let me adjust the plan:

I need to either:
1. Unlock blue_door_1 (which requires going to it first) OR
2. Pick up some object

Let's explore option 2 since it seems simpler:

1. gotoobject blue_ball_2 room_2 - Go to blue_ball_2 in the current room
2. pick blue_ball_2 room_2 - Pick up blue_ball_2
3. gotodoor blue_door_2 room_2 room_4 - Go to blue_door_2
4. toggle blue_door_2 - Unlock blue_door_2

This should work because:
- blue_door_2 starts locked (satisfying constraint 1)
- After that state, I'll be holding an object (satisfying constraint 2)
- I end up in front of an unlocked blue door (achieving the goal)

Let me double check this plan:

1. gotoobject blue_ball_2 room_2 - Go to blue_ball_2 in room_2
2. pick blue_ball_2 room_2 - Pick up blue_ball_2
3. gotodoor blue_door_2 room_2 room_4 - Go to blue_door_2
4. toggle blue_door_2 - Unlock blue_door_2

After action 4, I'll be in front of blue_door_2, which is a blue door that is now unlocked, satisfying the goal.

Constraint 1 is satisfied because blue_door_2 is locked in the initial state.
Constraint 2 is satisfied because after blue_door_2 is locked (in the initial state), I'll be holding blue_ball_2.

This plan seems valid.

Wait, let me double-check the preconditions for each action:

1. gotoobject blue_ball_2 room_2:
   - I'm in room_2 ✓
2. pick blue_ball_2 room_2:
   - I'm in the same room as blue_ball_2 ✓
   - I'm not holding any object ✓
3. gotodoor blue_door_2 room_2 room_4:
   - I'm in room_2 ✓
   - blue_door_2 connects room_2 and room_4 ✓
   - No object is blocking the door ✓
4. toggle blue_door_2:
   - I'm in front of blue_door_2 ✓

And the effects:
1. gotoobject:
   - I'll be in front of blue_ball_2
2. pick:
   - I'll be holding blue_ball_2
   - I'll no longer be in front of blue_ball_2
   - My hands won't be empty
3. gotodoor:
   - I'll be in front of blue_door_2
4. toggle:
   - blue_door_2 will be unlocked

After the final action, I'll be in front of blue_door_2, which is a blue door and is now unlocked, satisfying the goal.

Let me verify the optimal plan once more:

1. gotoobject blue_ball_2 room_2
2. pick blue_ball_2 room_2
3. gotodoor blue_door_2 room_2 room_4
4. toggle blue_door_2

That's a solution in 4 actions, which seems optimal.

Actually, I just realized there might be an even shorter solution. Let me try to directly go to blue_door_2 and toggle it, without picking up any object:

1. gotodoor blue_door_2 room_2 room_4
2. toggle blue_door_2

But this would violate constraint 2: After blue_door_2 is locked (in the initial state), I need to either unlock blue_door_1 or hold an object. If I just unlock blue_door_2, neither condition is met.

So, the optimal plan is as previously determined:

1. gotoobject blue_ball_2 room_2
2. pick blue_ball_2 room_2
3. gotodoor blue_door_2 room_2 room_4
4. toggle blue_door_2

Actually, I just realized I misunderstood constraint 2. Let's clarify:

"If expression 'blue_door_2 is locked' holds in some state s, then expression 'At least one of the following conditions is true: 'blue_door_1 is not locked', 'you are holding some object'' must hold at s or at some state after s"

This means that after any state where blue_door_2 is locked, I need to ensure that either blue_door_1
is unlocked OR I'm holding an object. 

Initially, blue_door_2 is locked. So, I need to satisfy the "at least one" condition. I can do this by either unlocking blue_door_1 or picking up an object.

Let's review our plan again:

1. gotoobject blue_ball_2 room_2
2. pick blue_ball_2 room_2
3. gotodoor blue_door_2 room_2 room_4
4. toggle blue_door_2

After step 2, I'll be holding blue_ball_2, which satisfies the condition. So, this plan should work.

But let's double-check if there's a shorter path to the goal. The goal is to be in front of an unlocked blue door. This could be either blue_door_1 or blue_door_2.

If I choose blue_door_1, I'd need to:
1. Unlock purple_door_1 to go from room_2 to room_1
2. Then go to blue_door_1
3. Unlock blue_door_1

This seems longer than the plan I proposed.

If I choose blue_door_2, I need to:
1. Go to blue_door_2
2. Unlock blue_door_2

But I also need to satisfy the constraint, which means I need to either unlock blue_door_1 or pick up an object. Picking up an object seems more efficient.

So, the optimal plan seems to be:

1. gotoobject blue_ball_2 room_2
2. pick blue_ball_2 room_2
3. gotodoor blue_door_2 room_2 room_4
4. toggle blue_door_2

Actually, I realized I'm still a bit confused about constraint 2. Let me re-read it:

"If expression 'blue_door_2 is locked' holds in some state s, then expression 'At least one of the following conditions is true: 'blue_door_1 is not locked', 'you are holding some object'' must hold at s or at some state after s"

This means that in any state where blue_door_2 is locked, I either need to have blue_door_1 unlocked or be holding an object, either in that state or in a future state (but definitely after the state where blue_door_2 is locked).

So, given that blue_door_2 is locked in the initial state, I need to ensure that at some point after the initial state, either blue_door_1 is unlocked or I'm holding an object.

The plan I've devised:

1. gotoobject blue_ball_2 room_2
2. pick blue_ball_2 room_2
3. gotodoor blue_door_2 room_2 room_4
4. toggle blue_door_2

After step 2, I'll be holding blue_ball_2, which satisfies the constraint. Then, I'll go to blue_door_2 and unlock it, which achieves the goal. This plan seems optimal.

Actually, I missed something. I'm holding blue_ball_2 while toggling the door. This is fine for the constraint, but I want to ensure I'm actually in front of the door when I toggle it.

Let's review the effects of the actions:

- gotoobject: I'll be in front of the object.
- pick: I'll no longer be in front of the object, but I'll be holding it.
- gotodoor: I'll be in front of the door.
- toggle: The door's lock status will be flipped.

So my sequence seems correct:

1. gotoobject blue_ball_2 room_2 - Go to blue_ball_2 in room_2
2. pick blue_ball_2 room_2 - Pick up blue_ball_2
3. gotodoor blue_door_2 room_2 room_4 - Go to blue_door_2
4. toggle blue_door_2 - Unlock blue_door_2

After step 4, I'll be in front of an unlocked blue door (blue_door_2), which achieves the goal.

I believe this is the optimal solution.

Actually, let me consider if I can achieve the goal more efficiently by going to blue_door_1 instead.

Since I start in room_2 and blue_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3, I'd first need to go from room_2 to room_1 using purple_door_1.

Let's try to outline this alternative plan:

1. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1 - Go to purple_door_1
2. toggle purple_door_1 - Unlock purple_door_1
3. gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1 - Go from room_2 to room_1
4. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_3 - Go to blue_door_1
5. toggle blue_door_1 - Unlock blue_door_1

After step 5, I'll be in front of an unlocked blue door (blue_door_1), which achieves the goal.

But wait, I also need to satisfy constraint 2. Since blue_door_2 is locked in the initial state, I need to either unlock blue_door_1 or pick up an object. And in this new plan, I'm unlocking blue_door_1 at step 5, which satisfies the constraint.

So, both plans are valid. Let's compare their lengths:

Plan 1 (Using blue_door_2): 4 steps
Plan 2 (Using blue_door_1): 5 steps

Plan 1 is shorter, so it's the optimal solution.

But wait – let me review constraint 1:

"The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'blue_door_2 is locked'"

This is trivially satisfied since blue_door_2 is locked in the initial state.

However, I now notice something: Constraint 2 mentions that after a state where blue_door_2 is locked, I need to either unlock blue_door_1 or pick up an object. So my plan should ensure that after I toggle blue_door_2 to unlock it, either blue_door_1 is unlocked or I'm holding an object. But my current plan has me holding blue_ball_2 before I toggle blue_door_2, so the constraint is satisfied.

Actually, let me revisit this again. The constraint says:

"If expression 'blue_door_2 is locked' holds in some state s, then expression 'At least one of the following conditions is true: 'blue_door_1 is not locked', 'you are holding some object'' must hold at s or at some state after s"

This means that in any state s where blue_door_2 is locked, I need to ensure that in state s or in some state after s, either blue_door_1 is unlocked or I'm holding an object.

In the initial state, blue_door_2 is locked. So, I need to ensure that at some point (either in the initial state or after it), either blue_door_1 is unlocked or I'm holding an object.

With the plan I've outlined:

1. gotoobject blue_ball_2 room_2
2. pick blue_ball_2 room_2
3. gotodoor blue_door_2 room_2 room_4
4. toggle blue_door_2

After step 2, I'll be holding blue_ball_2, which satisfies the "at least one" condition. So, this plan does satisfy the constraint. And after the 4 steps, I'll be in front of an unlocked blue door, achieving the goal.

So, the optimal plan is:

1. gotoobject blue_ball_2 room_2
2. pick blue_ball_2 room_2
3. gotodoor blue_door_2 room_2 room_4
4. toggle blue_door_2

Actually, there's one more bit I'm not 100% sure about. The constraint says:

"If expression 'blue_door_2 is locked' holds in some state s, then expression 'At least one of the following conditions is true: 'blue_door_1 is not locked', 'you are holding some object'' must hold at s or at some state after s"

I've been interpreting this as: In any state s where blue_door_2 is locked, I need to ensure that either in state s or in some state after s, either blue_door_1 is unlocked or I'm holding an object.

Taking the initial state as an example: blue_door_2 is locked, so I need to ensure that either in the initial state or in some state after it, either blue_door_1 is unlocked or I'm holding an object.

But the statement could also be interpreted as: If ever blue_door_2 becomes locked (or starts locked), then at that exact moment or later, either blue_door_1 must be unlocked or I must be holding an object.

I think the second interpretation is more consistent with the wording, so that's what I'll go with.

Given that blue_door_2 is locked in the initial state, I need to ensure that at some point after the initial state, either blue_door_1 is unlocked or I'm holding an object.

With the plan:

1. gotoobject blue_ball_2 room_2
2. pick blue_ball_2 room_2
3. gotodoor blue_door_2 room_2 room_4
4. toggle blue_door_2

After step 2, I'll be holding blue_ball_2, which satisfies the constraint. So, this plan is valid. And after step 4, I'll be in front of an unlocked blue door, achieving the goal.

That's the optimal solution.

Let me think one more time. Let's first understand what constraint 2 really means:

"If expression 'blue_door_2 is locked' holds in some state s, then expression 'At least one of the following conditions is true: 'blue_door_1 is not locked', 'you are holding some object'' must hold at s or at some state after s"

This means that whenever blue_door_2 is locked (for example, the initial state), I need to ensure that at that same state or in a future state, either blue_door_1 is unlocked OR I'm holding an object.

Given the plan:

1. gotoobject blue_ball_2 room_2
2. pick blue_ball_2 room_2
3. gotodoor blue_door_2 room_2 room_4
4. toggle blue_door_2

After step 2, I'll be holding blue_ball_2. This is a state after the initial state (where blue_door_2 is locked), so it satisfies constraint 2. After step 4, I'll be in front of an unlocked blue door, achieving the goal.

So, this plan is optimal and valid. Here it is again for clarity:

1. gotoobject blue_ball_2 room_2
2. pick blue_ball_2 room_2
3. gotodoor blue_door_2 room_2 room_4
4. toggle blue_door_2
