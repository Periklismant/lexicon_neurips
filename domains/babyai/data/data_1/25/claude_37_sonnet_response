Alright, let's break down this planning problem:

1. We need to bring about a state where there's a green door that is unlocked and we're in front of it.
2. We have 3 green doors: `green_door_1`, `green_door_2`, and `green_door_3`. 
3. According to the constraints, we need to ensure that `green_door_1` is unlocked at some point during the plan.
4. However, before we can unlock `green_door_1`, we need to be in a state where we're holding `grey_ball_1`.

Let's plan a solution:

1. First, we need to pick up `grey_ball_1` which is in `room_1`.
2. Then, we need to go in front of `green_door_1` and toggle it (unlock it).
3. Finally, we need to be in front of a green door that is unlocked. It doesn't necessarily have to be `green_door_1`, but since we're already unlocking it, we might as well use it.

Let's break down the steps:

1. `gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_1` - Move to `grey_ball_1` in `room_1`.
2. `pick grey_ball_1 room_1` - Pick up `grey_ball_1`.
3. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_2` - Go in front of `green_door_1` (which connects `room_1` and `room_2`).
4. `toggle green_door_1` - Unlock `green_door_1`.
5. `drop grey_ball_1 room_1` - We don't need to be holding `grey_ball_1` anymore.
   (Actually, I'm not sure we need to drop the ball for the final goal. Let's check if the goal specifies anything about what we're holding.)

The goal is just to be in front of a green door that's unlocked. It doesn't say anything about what we're holding. However, to toggle the door, we need to be in front of it, not holding anything. So our previous plan doesn't work correctly.

Actually, I'm confused. Let's revisit the preconditions and effects for the actions.

For the `toggle` action, it says: "you may only toggle a door d if you are in front of d." There's no mention of not holding any object.

So, the plan should be:

1. `gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_1` - Move to `grey_ball_1` in `room_1`.
2. `pick grey_ball_1 room_1` - Pick up `grey_ball_1`.
3. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_2` - Go in front of `green_door_1` (which connects `room_1` and `room_2`).
4. `toggle green_door_1` - Unlock `green_door_1`.

And that's it. After these actions, we'll be in front of an unlocked green door (`green_door_1`).

Wait, there's a potential issue. The action "pick" has a precondition that you're not holding any object. So we need to make sure our hands are empty before picking up `grey_ball_1`. But looking at the initial state, it says "you are not holding any object," so we should be good.

Now, the precondition for `gotodoor` is that we can only go in front of a door d if (i) we are in a room which door d is connecting with another room, and (ii) there is no object blocking the position in front of d in the room we are currently in. We need to make sure there's no object blocking `green_door_1`.

In the initial state, it doesn't mention any object blocking `green_door_1`, so we should be good.

However, I'm also noticing that after picking up `grey_ball_1`, the effect states that we are no longer in front of it. This means we're not in front of anything (no mention of an empty position). Looking at the preconditions for `gotodoor`, it seems that we can only go in front of a door if we are in a room that the door connects. Since we're in `room_1` and `green_door_1` connects `room_1` and `room_2`, this should be fine.

I'm a bit uncertain about the interactions, but based on my understanding, the plan should be:

1. `gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_1` - Move to `grey_ball_1` in `room_1`.
2. `pick grey_ball_1 room_1` - Pick up `grey_ball_1`.
3. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_2` - Go in front of `green_door_1` (which connects `room_1` and `room_2`).
4. `toggle green_door_1` - Unlock `green_door_1`.

After these steps, we'll have fulfilled the goal and the constraints.

Actually, the goal is "There is a door d such that "The following conditions are all true: "d is green", "you are in front of d", "d is not locked"". Given our plan, we've unlocked `green_door_1` and we're in front of it.

Actually, I'm looking back at the preconditions and I see the issue. For "toggle", the precondition is that we're in front of the door, not that our hands are empty. But for "gotodoor", the precondition is that we're in a room that connects to the door and there's no object blocking the door.

Let's rethink our plan.  Actually let me review the preconditions of all the actions more closely.

"goto object": you may only go in front of an object x if you are in the same room as x.
"goto empty": you may go in front of an empty position anytime.
"goto door": you may only go in front of a door d if (i) you are in a room which door d is connecting with another room, and (ii) there is no object blocking the position in front of d in the room you are currently in.
"goto room": you may only go in a room r if (i) you are currently in a room r0 that is adjacent to r, and (ii) the door that is connecting r0 and r is unlocked.
"pick": you may only pick up an object x if (i) you are in the same room as x, and (ii) you are currently not holding any object.
"drop": you may only drop an object x if (i) you are currently holding x, and (ii) the position in front of you is empty.
"toggle": you may only toggle a door d if you are in front of d.

Ok, here's the plan:

1. `gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_1` - Move to `grey_ball_1` in `room_1`. 
2. `pick grey_ball_1 room_1` - Pick up `grey_ball_1`. (Now we're not in front of anything.)
3. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_2` - Go in front of `green_door_1` (which connects `room_1` and `room_2`).
4. `gotoempty` - Go in front of an empty position. (Now we need to drop the ball because we can only toggle the door if we're in front of it.)
5. `drop grey_ball_1 room_1` - Drop `grey_ball_1`. (Now we're in front of the ball, and our hands are empty.)
6. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_2` - Go in front of `green_door_1` again.
7. `toggle green_door_1` - Unlock `green_door_1`. 

Wait, actually, I'm confused by "gotoempty" is there anything about positioning here that I'm misunderstanding? So, if we're hold `grey_ball_1`, do we need to use an additional action to get to an "empty" position before dropping it?

Let's review the effects of the actions:

"goto object": After performing this action regarding an object x, (i) if you were in front of some object or door x0, then you are no longer in front of x0 and (ii) you are in front of object x.
"goto empty": After performing this action, (i) if you were in front of some object or door x0, then you are no longer in front of x0 and (ii) you are in front of an empty position.
"goto door": After performing this action regarding a door d, (i) if you were in front of some object or door x0, then you are no longer in front of x0 and (ii) you are in front of door d.
"goto room": After performing this action in order to go from room r1 to room r2, (i) you are no longer in r1, (ii) you are in r2, (iii) you have visited r2, (iv) if you were in front of some object or door x0, then you are no longer in front of x0.
"pick": After performing this action regarding an object x, (i) you are no longer in front of x, (ii) your hands are no longer empty, (iii) you are carrying x, (iv) x is no longer in the room, and (v) if x was blocking some door, then it is no longer blocking that door.
"drop": After performing this action regarding an object x, (i) you are no longer carrying x, (ii) you are in front of x, (iii) your hands are empty, and (iv) object x is situated in the room you are currently in.
"toggle": After performing this action on a door d, (i) if d was locked, then it becomes unlocked, and (ii) if d was unlocked, then it becomes locked.

Ok, so after "pick", we are no longer in front of the object.

And for "drop", we need to be in front of an empty position. Hmm...wait a minute. The precondition for "drop" is just that we are holding the object and are in front of an empty position.

After picking, we're no longer in front of anything. So we need to use `gotoempty` to go in front of an empty position before dropping.

Given all of this, here's the correct plan:

1. `gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_1` - Move to `grey_ball_1` in `room_1`.
2. `pick grey_ball_1 room_1` - Pick up `grey_ball_1`. (Now we're not in front of anything.)
3. `gotoempty` - Go in front of an empty position. (This enables dropping the ball).
4. `drop grey_ball_1 room_1` - Drop `grey_ball_1`. (Now we're in front of the ball, and our hands are empty.)
5. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_2` - Go in front of `green_door_1`.
6. `toggle green_door_1` - Unlock `green_door_1`.

Now let's double-check the constraints to make sure we're meeting them:

1. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: "green_door_1 is not locked"" - Yes, after step 6.
2. "If expression "green_door_1 is not locked" holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: "you are holding grey_ball_1"" - Yes, after step 2 and before step 4.

OK actually I'm overthinking things I believe. Let's re-read the drop precondition:

"drop": you may only drop an object x if (i) you are currently holding x, and (ii) the position in front of you is empty.

I misunderstood. The precondition is not that we are in front of an empty position, but that the position in front of us is empty. Given the action's descriptions, I don't actually know if there's a concept of "the position in front of us" other than what we are "in front of".

Hmm, I'm having a difficult time understanding "in front of". 

Let's take a step back. The goal is to be in front of a green door that's unlocked. We have 3 green doors, and all 3 are initially locked. We need to unlock one of these doors.

The constraints say that `green_door_1` must be unlocked at some point, and before that, you must be holding `grey_ball_1`. So

1. We need to pick up `grey_ball_1`.
2. We need to unlock `green_door_1`.
3. We need to be in front of a green door that's unlocked.

Now, the most straightforward approach would be to pick up `grey_ball_1`, go in front of `green_door_1`, unlock it, and then we've achieved our goal. But let's check if this is feasible.

The precondition for "toggle" is that we're in front of the door.
The precondition for "gotodoor" is that we're in a room that the door connects and there's no object blocking the door.

In our initial state, we're in `room_1`, not holding any object, and `grey_ball_1` is in `room_1`. The door `green_door_1` connects `room_1` and `room_2`. There's no mention of any object blocking this door.

Let's trace through the steps and see how the state changes:

**Initial State**
- We're in `room_1`.
- We're not holding any object.
- `grey_ball_1` is in `room_1`.
- `green_door_1` connects `room_1` and `room_2`.
- `green_door_1` is locked.

**Step 1: `gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_1`**
- We move to `grey_ball_1` in `room_1`.
- We're now in front of `grey_ball_1`.

**Step 2: `pick grey_ball_1 room_1`**
- We pick up `grey_ball_1`.
- We're no longer in front of `grey_ball_1`.
- Our hands are no longer empty.
- We're carrying `grey_ball_1`.
- `grey_ball_1` is no longer in `room_1`.

**Step 3: `gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_2`**
- We go in front of `green_door_1`.
- We're now in front of `green_door_1`.

**Step 4: `toggle green_door_1`**
- We unlock `green_door_1`.
- `green_door_1` is now unlocked.

At this point, we're in front of `green_door_1`, and `green_door_1` is unlocked, which meets our goal. We've also satisfied the constraints because, at one point, `green_door_1` was unlocked, and earlier, we were holding `grey_ball_1`.

So, the correct plan is:

1. `gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_1`
2. `pick grey_ball_1 room_1`
3. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_2`
4. `toggle green_door_1`

But let's double check: Can we toggle a door while holding an object?

Let's check the precondition for "toggle" again: "you may only toggle a door d if you are in front of d." 

There's no requirement that we're not holding an object. So, I believe we can toggle the door while holding `grey_ball_1`.

So, the plan I proposed should be valid.

OK I'm actually satisfied my understanding of the semantics of the domain now. Let's finish the plan:

1. `gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_1`
2. `pick grey_ball_1 room_1`
3. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_2`
4. `toggle green_door_1`

After these steps, we're in front of a green door that's unlocked, which is our goal. We've also satisfied the constraints:
- `green_door_1` is unlocked in the final state.
- Before it's unlocked, we were holding `grey_ball_1`.

I believe this is the optimal plan, as it's the most direct route to achieve the goal while satisfying the constraints.

Actually one more check: to be thorough, let's verify that the goal requires us to be standing in front of a green door that's unlocked.

The goal is: "There is a door d such that 'The following conditions are all true: "d is green", "you are in front of d", "d is not locked"'"

Yes, this confirms that our plan is correct. We need to be in front of a green door that's unlocked, which is exactly what our plan achieves.

Our optimal plan is thus:

1. `gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_1`
2. `pick grey_ball_1 room_1`
3. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_2`
4. `toggle green_door_1`
