Okay, let's tackle this planning problem step by step. The goal is to have a green door that I'm in front of and it's unlocked. The constraints say that at some point green_door_1 must be unlocked, and if it's ever unlocked, I must have held grey_ball_1 before that.

First, looking at the initial state: I'm in room_1. All doors are locked. The green_door_1 connects room_1 and room_2. So maybe I need to unlock green_door_1. But how? To toggle a door, I need to be in front of it. But to get in front of it, I need to go to the door. However, the door might be blocked by an object. Wait, the preconditions for "gotodoor" say that there's no object blocking the position in front of the door in the current room. In room_1, the objects present are green_box_1, grey_ball_1, and green_box_2. Are any of these blocking the door? The problem statement doesn't mention objects blocking doors initially, so maybe they aren't. So perhaps I can go to the door.

Wait, but "goto door d r1 r2" requires that I'm in a room connected by d. Since I'm in room_1, green_door_1 connects room_1 and room_2. So I can go to green_door_1 from room_1. Then I can toggle it. But toggling a locked door unlocks it. But the constraint says that if green_door_1 is ever unlocked, I must have held grey_ball_1 before. So I need to first pick up grey_ball_1, then do something else.

So the steps might be:

1. Go to grey_ball_1 in room_1 (using gotoobject).
2. Pick up grey_ball_1.
3. Go to green_door_1 in room_1 (gotodoor).
4. Toggle it (which unlocks it, since it was locked).
But wait, after picking up the ball, I need to drop it somewhere? Or maybe not, as long as I have held it before unlocking the door. The constraint is that if green_door_1 is unlocked in any state, then there must be an earlier state where I was holding grey_ball_1. So I just need to have picked it up before unlocking.

But once I unlock the door, the goal requires that there exists a door d (green, in front of it, not locked). So green_door_1 after unlocking would satisfy this. But do I need to stay in front of it? The goal is "you are in front of d" and "d is not locked". So after unlocking, I need to be in front of it.

Wait, the order matters. Let's see:

If I unlock the door (toggle) while in front of it, then the door becomes unlocked. But the goal is to have a state where I'm in front of a green door that's unlocked. So perhaps after toggling, I'm already in front of it, so that satisfies the goal. But wait, when you toggle, the effect is that the door's state changes. So after toggling green_door_1, it becomes unlocked, and if I'm still in front of it, then the goal is achieved.

So the plan could be:

1. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_1
2. pick grey_ball_1 room_1
3. drop grey_ball_1 room_1 (but wait, why? Because after picking it up, I can't hold it while going to the door? Wait, no. The preconditions for gotodoor don't require holding nothing, just that the door's position isn't blocked. But maybe after picking up the ball, I can go to the door. Wait, the "gotodoor" action requires that there's no object blocking the door. Since when I pick up the grey_ball_1, it's removed from the room, so the position in front of the door is not blocked anymore (if it was blocked by the ball). Wait, the initial state didn't mention any door being blocked. So maybe the path is clear.

Wait, in the initial state, are there any objects blocking doors? The problem says that in the initial state, the rooms have objects but doesn't mention any door being blocked. So perhaps the doors are not blocked. So I can proceed.

So the plan steps:

- Go to grey_ball_1 (room_1) to pick it up. Then, drop it somewhere? Or maybe just holding it is enough. But the constraint is that in some state, green_door_1 is unlocked, and in an earlier state, I was holding grey_ball_1. So if I pick up grey_ball_1, then unlock green_door_1, that satisfies the constraint. Then, after unlocking, I can drop the ball if needed.

But the goal is to have a door that is green, in front of it, and unlocked. So after toggling green_door_1 (unlocking it), if I'm still in front of it, then that satisfies the goal.

Wait, when I do "gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_2", I am in front of the door. Then, I "toggle green_door_1" which unlocks it. So after this action, the door is unlocked, and I'm in front of it, which meets the goal.

But to do that, I need to first pick up grey_ball_1, then go to the door, then toggle. But wait, when I pick up grey_ball_1, I have to be in the same room. Then, after picking it up, I can go to the door. But can I go to the door while holding the ball? The gotodoor action doesn't require the hands to be empty. So:

1. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_1
2. pick grey_ball_1 room_1
3. gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_2
4. toggle green_door_1

After step 4, green_door_1 is unlocked, and I'm in front of it. So the goal is achieved. Also, the constraint is satisfied because step 2 is when I was holding grey_ball_1, which is before step 4 where green_door_1 is unlocked.

But wait, the initial state has green_door_1 locked. So after toggle, it's unlocked. Then, the goal is satisfied. Also, the constraints are met because in step 2, I held the grey_ball_1, which is before unlocking.

But wait, the constraints say that if green_door_1 is not locked in any state, there must be an earlier state where I was holding grey_ball_1. So in this plan, step 4 is when green_door_1 becomes unlocked (not locked). Step 2 is the earlier state where I held grey_ball_1. So that's okay.

But is this the minimal plan? Let's check. Are there any shorter steps?

Alternatively, maybe:

- Can I pick up the grey_ball_1, then unlock the door, but maybe not need to drop it? The plan above is 4 steps. Let's see:

1. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_1
2. pick grey_ball_1 room_1
3. gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_2
4. toggle green_door_1

Yes. Then, after step 4, the door is unlocked, and I'm in front of it. The goal is satisfied. The constraints are also met. This is 4 steps.

But wait, the initial position: the agent is in room_1. Are they already in front of an object or door? The initial state says "you are in room_1" but doesn't mention being in front of anything. So the first action would be to go to the grey_ball_1. Then pick it up. Then go to the door. Then toggle. That's four steps. That seems optimal.

But maybe there's a way to do it in fewer steps. Let's think. For example, maybe I don't need to drop the ball. Since after unlocking the door, the goal is achieved. So the plan above is valid. Let's confirm each action's preconditions:

Step 1: gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_1. Preconditions: same room as the object (room_1). Yes. So allowed.

Step 2: pick grey_ball_1 room_1. Preconditions: same room, not holding anything. Correct.

Step 3: gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_2. Preconditions: in a room connected by the door (room_1), and no object blocking the door's position. Since the initial state doesn't mention any objects blocking doors, and after picking up the grey_ball_1, it's no longer in the room, so the door's position isn't blocked. So allowed.

Step 4: toggle green_door_1. Preconditions: must be in front of the door. Yes, after step 3, you are in front of it.

Effects of step 4: door is unlocked. So the goal is met. Also, the constraint that green_door_1 is unlocked in some state (step 4) and earlier state (step 2) where held grey_ball_1 is satisfied.

Yes, this plan works. So the answer is this four-step plan.
