Let's understand the problem:

1. We're in a 2D gridworld with 4 rooms arranged in a square formation: room_1 (NW), room_2 (SW), room_3 (NE), room_4 (SE).
2. The rooms are connected by doors: room_1-room_2 (yellow_door_1), room_1-room_3 (yellow_door_2), room_2-room_4 (red_door_1), room_3-room_4 (green_door_1).
3. Initially all doors are locked.
4. The rooms contain boxes and balls of different colors.

We start in room_1 and have visited it. We need to:
1. End up in front of a blue box.
2. Ensure that at some point either "purple_box_1 is in room_3" or "yellow_door_1 is unlocked".

Given the initial state, there are blue boxes in room_1 (blue_box_1 and blue_box_2) and room_3 (blue_box_3). We are already in room_1, so the easiest way to solve the problem would be to just go in front of one of the blue boxes in room_1.

However, there's the constraint that at some point either purple_box_1 should be in room_3 or yellow_door_1 should be unlocked. Currently, purple_box_1 is in room_2, and yellow_door_1 is locked.

To satisfy this constraint, we can:
1. Move purple_box_1 to room_3.
2. Unlock yellow_door_1.

Let's think step by step:

Option 1: Moving purple_box_1 to room_3.
- We need to go to room_2, pick up purple_box_1, and then go to room_3.
- To go to room_2, we need to unlock yellow_door_1.
- To go to room_3, we can go via room_1 after picking up purple_box_1, and we need to unlock yellow_door_2 to do that.

Option 2: Unlocking yellow_door_1.
- We can directly go to the door and toggle it.

It seems like Option 2 is simpler. Let's plan:

1. Go to yellow_door_1 (the door connecting room_1 and room_2).
2. Toggle it to unlock it (satisfying the constraint).
3. Go to one of the blue boxes in room_1 (either blue_box_1 or blue_box_2).

Now let's see how to execute these actions based on the given actions and preconditions:

1. First, we need to go in front of yellow_door_1:
   "gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2"

2. Toggle it to unlock:
   "toggle yellow_door_1"

3. Go to blue_box_1:
   "gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1"

This should satisfy both the goal and the constraint.

Let's double-check:
- The goal was to be in front of a blue box. After step 3, we're in front of blue_box_1, which is blue.
- The constraint was that at some point, either purple_box_1 is in room_3 or yellow_door_1 is not locked. After step 2, yellow_door_1 is unlocked, so we've satisfied this constraint.

Therefore, my plan is:

```
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2
toggle yellow_door_1
gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1
```

Actually, I need to make sure all the preconditions are met. Let's check:

For "gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2":
- We're in room_1, which yellow_door_1 connects to.
- There's no mention of any object blocking the door, so I assume it's not blocked.

For "toggle yellow_door_1":
- We need to be in front of the door, which we are after the previous action.

For "gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1":
- We can only go in front of an object if we're in the same room as it. We are in room_1 and blue_box_1 is in room_1, so we can do this.

Let me redo the plan, but let me first validate the preconditions and effects:

Initial state:
- We are in room_1
- blue_box_1 and blue_box_2 are in room_1
- All doors are locked
- Our hands are empty

1. "gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2"
   Preconditions:
   - We are in room_1, which yellow_door_1 is connecting with another room.
   - There's no indication of any object blocking the door in room_1.
   Effects:
   - We are no longer in front of anything (if we were).
   - We are now in front of yellow_door_1.

2. "toggle yellow_door_1"
   Preconditions:
   - We are in front of yellow_door_1.
   Effects:
   - yellow_door_1 is unlocked.

3. "gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1"
   Preconditions:
   - We are in room_1.
   - blue_box_1 is in room_1.
   Effects:
   - We are no longer in front of yellow_door_1.
   - We are now in front of blue_box_1.

After step 3, we are in front of blue_box_1, which is a blue box, thus satisfying our goal. At some point (after step 2), yellow_door_1 was unlocked, satisfying our constraint. Thus, our plan is valid.

```
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2
toggle yellow_door_1
gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1
```

However, I realized I might be misunderstanding the task. Let me re-examine the goal:

"There is a box v such that "The following conditions are all true: "v is blue", "you are in front of v"""

This simply says I need to be in front of a blue box (any blue box). The boxes blue_box_1, blue_box_2, and blue_box_3 are blue, so being in front of any of them would satisfy the goal.

For the constraint, I correctly identified that at some point, either purple_box_1 needs to be in room_3 or yellow_door_1 needs to be unlocked.

Given that we start in room_1 and blue_box_1 and blue_box_2 are already in room_1, the simplest plan would be:

```
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2
toggle yellow_door_1
gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1
```

But actually, I can make an even simpler plan. I'm in room_1, and blue_box_1 and blue_box_2 are in room_1. If my goal is simply to be in front of a blue box, I can go straight to one of those blue boxes in room_1. Then to satisfy the constraint, I can go to yellow_door_1 and toggle it.

```
gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2
toggle yellow_door_1
gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1
```

However, this seems inefficient because I would be going to and from the blue box. Instead, let's toggle the door first and then go to the blue box:

```
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2
toggle yellow_door_1
gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1
```

This way, I satisfy both the constraint (yellow_door_1 is unlocked after step 2) and the goal (being in front of a blue box after step 3). The plan is optimal in the sense that I don't waste steps going back and forth.

Wait, I realized there might be another interpretation of the plan. It's not clear if the constraint means that at some point during the execution of the plan, the specified condition should hold, or if the condition should be satisfied at the end of the plan.

If it's the latter (the condition should be satisfied at the end of the plan), then the plan I provided should be fine. After the plan is executed, yellow_door_1 will be unlocked, which satisfies the constraint.

But if it's the former (the condition should hold at some point during the execution, but not necessarily at the end), the plan is still valid because after step 2, the constraint is satisfied.

Given the wording:
"The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'At least one of the following conditions is true: "purple_box_1 is in room_3", "yellow_door_1 is not locked"'"

It does seem like the constraint is about the condition holding in at least one state during the execution of the plan, not necessarily the final state. My plan ensures that after step 2, yellow_door_1 is unlocked, so we're good to go.

So, my final plan is:

```
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2
toggle yellow_door_1
gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1
```

Now let me verify this plan with the initial state, the goal, and the constraints one more time:

1. Initial State:
   - We're in room_1.
   - blue_box_1 and blue_box_2 are in room_1.
   - All doors are locked.

2. Goal:
   - Be in front of a blue box. After step 3, we're in front of blue_box_1, which is blue. So, the goal is met.

3. Constraint:
   - At some point, either purple_box_1 is in room_3 or yellow_door_1 is unlocked. After step 2, yellow_door_1 is unlocked, so the constraint is met.

In conclusion, the plan is valid and optimal for the given problem.

```
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2
toggle yellow_door_1
gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1
```

Actually, let me more rigorously check if this is the optimal plan. 

We want to be in front of a blue box. There are blue boxes in room_1 (blue_box_1 and blue_box_2) and room_3 (blue_box_3). We are already in room_1, so to minimize steps, it's best to go to a blue box in room_1.

We also want to satisfy the constraint that at some point, either purple_box_1 is in room_3 or yellow_door_1 is unlocked.

Moving purple_box_1 to room_3 is a longer process: We'd need to unlock doors, go to room_2, pick up the box, go to room_3, and drop it. 

Unlocking yellow_door_1 is simpler: Go to the door, toggle it. 

Therefore, for an optimal plan, we should choose to unlock yellow_door_1 to satisfy the constraint.

Given the above, the most efficient plan to satisfy both the goal and the constraint would be:

```
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2
toggle yellow_door_1
gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1
```

In fact, it might be even more clear if I go to the blue box first, then to the door:

```
gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2
toggle yellow_door_1
```

But this leaves my final position as in front of the door, not the blue box. The goal is to be in front of a blue box. So it's better to do the door first, then end up at the blue box, as in the plan I originally proposed.

Actually, even more significantly, if we go to the blue box first and then to the door, our final state would be in front of the door, not the blue box. But the goal is to end up in front of a blue box, which means being in front of a blue box should be the last step. 

So, I'm convinced that this is the right plan:

```
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2
toggle yellow_door_1
gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1
```

Actually, I just realized we could just immediately go to a blue box:

```
gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1
```

But that wouldn't fulfill the constraint that at some point either purple_box_1 is in room_3 or yellow_door_1 is unlocked. The constraint seems to be a mandatory part of the problem, not an optional condition. So, we do need to unlock yellow_door_1 in our plan.

Alright, going back to:

```
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2
toggle yellow_door_1
gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1
```

Let me verify one more time that this plan is optimal:

1. It satisfies the constraint by unlocking yellow_door_1.
2. It ends with us in front of a blue box, satisfying the goal.
3. It uses only 3 actions, and I can't think of a valid shorter sequence.

Given the setup and constraints, I believe this is the optimal plan for the problem.

```
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2
toggle yellow_door_1
gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1
```

Actually, just to double check, maybe if  I had used a different blue box in room_1:

```
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2
toggle yellow_door_1
gotoobject blue_box_2 room_1
```

This would be equally valid and the same number of steps. So either of these would be an optimal plan.

I think the correct plan is:

```
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2
toggle yellow_door_1
gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1
```

Let me double-check my assumptions by rereading the problem statement:

1. We're in a 2D gridworld with 4 rooms: room_1 (NW), room_2 (SW), room_3 (NE), room_4 (SE).
2. The rooms are connected by doors: yellow_door_1 (room_1-room_2), yellow_door_2 (room_1-room_3), red_door_1 (room_2-room_4), green_door_1 (room_3-room_4).
3. All doors are initially locked.
4. In room_1, there's blue_box_1 and blue_box_2. There's blue_box_3 in room_3.
5. Our goal is to end up in front of a blue box.
6. We must, at some point, ensure that either purple_box_1 is in room_3 or yellow_door_1 is unlocked.

Given the above, my plan is optimal:

1. Go to yellow_door_1 in room_1.
2. Unlock yellow_door_1.
3. Go to blue_box_1 (or blue_box_2) in room_1.

This plan requires 3 steps, satisfies the constraint (after step 2), and achieves the goal (after step 3). I've thoroughly checked, and this is the optimal plan for the given problem.

```
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2
toggle yellow_door_1
gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1
```

For completeness:

- We start in room_1.
- We go to the door yellow_door_1 connecting room_1 and room_2.
- We toggle (unlock) yellow_door_1.
- We go to blue_box_1 in room_1.

After executing this plan, we're in front of blue_box_1, which is a blue box, satisfying the goal. At some point (after step 2), yellow_door_1 was unlocked, satisfying the constraint.

I think my final answer should be:

```
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2
toggle yellow_door_1
gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1
```
