Okay, let's tackle this planning problem step by step. The goal is to have a green door that I'm in front of and it's unlocked. Also, there's a constraint that if green_door_1 is unlocked at any point, I must have held grey_ball_1 before that. Let's start by understanding the initial state.

I'm in room_1. The doors green_door_1 (connecting room_1 and room_2) and purple_door_1 (connecting room_1 and room_3) are both locked. The other doors, green_door_2 (room_2 and room_4) and green_door_3 (room_3 and room_4), are also locked. So all doors start locked.

In room_1, there's green_box_1, grey_ball_1, and green_box_2. Room_3 has purple_ball_1, purple_box_1, red_ball_1, and grey_ball_2. Room_4 has yellow_box_1. The goal requires me to be in front of a green door that's unlocked. The possible green doors are green_door_1, green_door_2, and green_door_3. Let's see which ones I can reach.

But first, the constraint: if I unlock green_door_1, I must have held grey_ball_1 before. Since grey_ball_1 is in room_1, that's accessible. Let's consider the possible green doors:

1. green_door_1 is in room_1, connecting to room_2. But it's locked. To unlock it, I need to toggle it, which requires being in front of it. But to get in front of it, I need to check if anything is blocking. The preconditions for gotodoor d r1 r2 are that I'm in a room connected by d and no object is blocking the position in front of d in my current room. In room_1, is there any object blocking green_door_1? The initial state says that objects in room_1 are green_box_1, grey_ball_1, green_box_2. Are any of these blocking the door? The problem description mentions that if an object is blocking a door, picking it up would unblock it. So if any of these objects are in front of the door, I need to move them. Wait, but the initial state doesn't explicitly say that any objects are blocking doors. The problem says that the 'goto door' action is possible if there's no object blocking the position in front of d in the current room. So unless the initial state specifies that objects are in front of doors, perhaps they aren't. So maybe I can go to the door directly.

Wait, but how do objects block doors? The 'pick' action's effect (iv) says that if x was blocking a door, then it's no longer blocking. So perhaps objects can be in front of doors, thereby blocking them. The initial state doesn't mention any objects blocking doors, so maybe all doors are unblocked. Therefore, I can perform 'gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_2' since I'm in room_1. Then, I need to toggle it. But to toggle, I need to be in front of it. So first, go to the door, then toggle. But the door is locked, so toggling would unlock it. However, the constraint says that if green_door_1 is unlocked at any state, I must have held grey_ball_1 earlier. So if I toggle green_door_1, I need to have held grey_ball_1 before.

So the steps could be:

1. Go to grey_ball_1 in room_1 (using 'gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_1').
2. Pick it up.
3. Drop it somewhere (maybe not necessary, but the constraint only requires that I held it, not that I still have it).
4. Then go to green_door_1, toggle it to unlock.

But wait, after picking up grey_ball_1, I need to drop it to have my hands free again for other actions. Because after picking, I'm holding it, so to perform other actions like 'gotodoor' or 'toggle', I need to have my hands free? Wait, the 'toggle' action's preconditions don't mention holding anything, only that I'm in front of the door. So perhaps after picking up the ball, I can still go to the door and toggle it. Let me check the preconditions again.

The 'toggle' action's preconditions: you may only toggle a door d if you are in front of d. So holding an object doesn't prevent that. But to pick up the ball, I need to be in the same room as the ball and not holding anything. So steps:

1. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_1
2. pick grey_ball_1 room_1
3. gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_2
4. toggle green_door_1

But after step 2, I'm holding the ball. Then step 3: can I perform 'gotodoor' while holding the ball? The preconditions for 'gotodoor' don't require being empty-handed. So yes. Then step 4: toggle the door. This would unlock it, fulfilling the goal. Then, the goal is to be in front of a green door that's unlocked. After toggling, the door is unlocked, and I'm in front of it. So that's the goal state.

But wait, the goal requires that "there is a door d such that d is green, you are in front of d, and d is not locked". So after step 4, I'm in front of green_door_1 (since step 3 is gotodoor, which puts me in front of it), and after toggling, it's unlocked. So that satisfies the goal. So the plan would be:

gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_1
pick grey_ball_1 room_1
gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_2
toggle green_door_1

But wait, after step 3, I'm in front of green_door_1. Then step 4, toggle it. Then the goal is achieved. But let's check the constraints.

The constraint is that if green_door_1 is not locked in some state, then I must have held grey_ball_1 in an earlier state. In this plan, after toggling green_door_1, it becomes unlocked. So in that state, the door is unlocked. The earlier state where I picked grey_ball_1 satisfies the condition. So this plan meets the constraint.

But wait, the initial state of green_door_1 is locked. So when I toggle it, it becomes unlocked. So after toggle, the door is unlocked. So the final state meets the goal. Also, the constraint is satisfied because when green_door_1 is unlocked (after toggle), there was a previous state where I was holding grey_ball_1 (after pick).

So this plan has 4 steps. Is there a shorter plan?

Wait, perhaps I can skip picking up the grey_ball_1 and use another door. Let's see. The other green doors are green_door_2 (connecting room_2 and room_4) and green_door_3 (connecting room_3 and room_4). To get to those, I might have to go through other doors. For example, if I go to room_3 via purple_door_1, but that's locked. So maybe that's not possible. Let's check.

The initial doors: all are locked. So I can't go through any door initially. So to unlock any door, I need to first get in front of it. But since all doors are locked, I can't move to another room unless I unlock a door from my current room. But in room_1, the doors are green_door_1 (to room_2) and purple_door_1 (to room_3). Both are locked. So the only way to unlock them is to be in front of them. So to get to green_door_1, which is in room_1, I can go there, but if there's any object blocking it. Since the initial state doesn't mention objects blocking doors, perhaps they are not blocked. So 'gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_2' is possible. Then, toggle to unlock. But the constraint says if I unlock green_door_1, I must have held grey_ball_1 before. So even if I directly go to the door and toggle it, that would violate the constraint. Because in that case, unlocking green_door_1 would happen without ever holding grey_ball_1.

Thus, the plan must include picking up grey_ball_1 before unlocking green_door_1. Therefore, the steps must include picking up grey_ball_1 first, then proceeding to unlock the door.

So the earlier plan is necessary. Let's check if there's a way to do it in fewer steps. For example:

1. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_1
2. pick grey_ball_1 room_1
3. gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_2
4. toggle green_door_1

But after step 4, I'm in front of green_door_1, which is now unlocked. The goal is satisfied. So that's four steps. Is there a shorter plan? Let's see:

If I can toggle the door without needing to pick up the ball, but the constraint requires that if green_door_1 is unlocked, I must have held the ball. So any plan that unlocks green_door_1 must have the holding of grey_ball_1 before. Therefore, the minimal steps would be the four steps above.

Alternatively, could I use another green door? For example, green_door_3 in room_3. But to get to room_3, I need to go through purple_door_1, which is locked. So to unlock purple_door_1, I need to be in front of it. But I'm in room_1. So:

gotoobject purple_door_1 room_1 room_3? Wait, the gotodoor action is 'gotodoor d r1 r2' where d connects r1 and r2. So in room_1, purple_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3. So gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_3. Then toggle it. But purple_door_1 is purple, not green. The goal requires a green door. So unlocking purple_door_1 wouldn't help. So even if I unlock purple_door_1, then go to room_3, then go to green_door_3 (connecting room_3 and room_4), unlock it, but that's more steps. Plus, the initial state of green_door_3 is locked. So to unlock it, I need to be in room_3 and in front of it. But getting to room_3 requires unlocking purple_door_1 first, which is purple, not green. So that seems longer.

Alternatively, maybe go to room_4 via room_2. But room_2 is connected via green_door_1 (locked). So same problem.

So the quickest path is to unlock green_door_1 in room_1, which requires holding grey_ball_1 first. Hence, the plan is four steps as before.

Wait, but after step 2 (picking up the ball), do I need to drop it somewhere before toggling? Because the 'toggle' action doesn't require being empty-handed. So no, I can hold the ball while toggling. But after the toggle, the goal is achieved. The problem doesn't require me to drop the ball. The constraint only requires that I held the ball before unlocking the door. So the plan is valid.

So the steps are:

gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_1
pick grey_ball_1 room_1
gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_2
toggle green_door_1

That's four actions. Each action is necessary. The gotoobject is needed to get to the ball. Pick is needed to hold it. Gotodoor is needed to get to the door. Toggle is needed to unlock it. This meets the constraints and achieves the goal.
