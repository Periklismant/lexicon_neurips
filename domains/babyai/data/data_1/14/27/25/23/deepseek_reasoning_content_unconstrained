Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. The goal is to have a green door that's unlocked, and I'm in front of it. The constraints aren't specified here, but the main thing is to achieve the goal with the optimal steps. Let me start by understanding the initial state.

So, the agent starts in room_1. The doors green_door_1 (connects room_1 and room_2), purple_door_1 (connects room_1 and room_3), green_door_2 (connects room_2 and room4), and green_door_3 (connects room3 and room4). All doors are initially locked. The green doors are green_door_1, green_door_2, green_door_3. The purple door is purple_door_1.

The goal is to have at least one green door that's unlocked, and I'm in front of it. So I need to get to a green door, unlock it, and be in front of it. The optimal plan would be the shortest possible way to do this.

Looking at the initial location: in room_1. The doors connected here are green_door_1 (to room_2) and purple_door_1 (to room_3). Both are locked. To unlock a door, I need to toggle it, but to toggle, I have to be in front of it. But to get in front of a door, I need to be in a room connected by that door. So, for example, to get to green_door_1 in room_1, I can go to it, but since it's in room_1 connected to room_2, I can be in front of green_door_1 from room_1. But wait, the preconditions for "gotodoor d r1 r2" require that I'm in a room that the door connects. So if I'm in room_1, I can go to green_door_1, which connects room_1 and room_2. However, there's another condition: there's no object blocking the position in front of the door in the current room. So, are there objects blocking the doors in room_1? Let's check the initial state.

In room_1, there's green_box_1, grey_ball_1, green_box_2. So if any of these objects are in front of the door, then the door is blocked. But how do I know where the objects are placed? The problem description doesn't specify their exact positions, only the rooms. Hmm. Wait, the problem states that "goto door" can be done only if there's no object blocking the position in front of d in the current room. Since the initial state doesn't mention any door being blocked by objects, maybe we can assume that the doors aren't blocked unless stated. But maybe the presence of objects in the room could block doors. Wait, the initial state doesn't specify that any objects are blocking doors, so perhaps the doors are not blocked. So I can go to the door.

So, first step: goto door green_door_1 from room_1. Then toggle it. But wait, green_door_1 is locked. To toggle it, I need to be in front of it. So:

1. gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_2
2. toggle green_door_1

That would unlock green_door_1, right? Because it's initially locked. Then, after toggling, it becomes unlocked. Then, the goal is to have a green door (which green_door_1 is) that's not locked, and be in front of it. But after step 2, the door is unlocked, and I'm already in front of it. So that would achieve the goal. But wait, after the toggle action, the agent is still in front of the door. So after step 2, the conditions would be met: the door is green, the agent is in front of it, and it's unlocked. So this two-step plan would work. But is there any reason this wouldn't be possible?

Wait, but the preconditions for "gotodoor" require that there's no object blocking the position in front of the door. Are there any objects blocking green_door_1 in room_1? The initial state has green_box_1, grey_ball_1, and green_box_2 in room_1, but unless they are blocking the door, the action is possible. Since the problem doesn't state that any objects are blocking doors, perhaps the doors are not blocked. So the initial steps are possible.

But let me check again. The initial state lists objects in the rooms but doesn't mention their positions. The "gotoobject" action requires being in the same room as the object, but the doors are in the rooms they connect. So, perhaps the doors are not blocked, so the plan is possible.

Therefore, the optimal plan would be:

goto door green_door_1 room_1 room_2

toggle green_door_1

But wait, the action "gotodoor" requires that the agent is in a room connected by the door. Since the agent starts in room_1, which is connected to room_2 via green_door_1, this is valid. Then, after gotodoor, the agent is in front of green_door_1, which is in room_1. Then toggle, which unlocks it. Then the goal is achieved: a green door (green_door_1) that's unlocked, and the agent is in front of it. That's two steps. Is there a shorter plan? No, because you need to first get to the door and then toggle it. So that's the minimal steps.

Alternatively, if there's a problem with objects blocking the door in room_1, then maybe the agent has to move objects first. But since the problem doesn't mention that any doors are blocked, we can assume that the initial doors are not blocked. Therefore, this two-step plan should work.
