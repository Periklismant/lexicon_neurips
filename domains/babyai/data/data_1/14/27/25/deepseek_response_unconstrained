```
The agent starts in room_2. First, they move to an empty position to clear any potential front position constraints. Then they navigate to the purple door connecting room_2 and room_4. The agent unlocks this door by toggling it. After passing through the now-unlocked door into room_4, they directly move in front of grey_ball_3 which already exists in room_4. This satisfies all goal conditions (grey ball in room_4, agent in room_4, and in front of the ball) with minimal steps.
