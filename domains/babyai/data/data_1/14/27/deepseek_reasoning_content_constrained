Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. The goal is to get a purple box in room_1, be in room_1, and be in front of that box. Also, there's a constraint that at some point I must be holding an object. Let's start by understanding the initial state and the required actions.

First, the agent starts in room_2. The purple_box_1 is in room_1, which is where we need it to be. So the box is already in the correct room. The main tasks are to get the agent to room_1 and be in front of purple_box_1. But the doors are all locked initially. So I need to unlock doors to move between rooms. Let's check the doors connecting the rooms.

The doors are red_door_1 (connects room_1 and room_2), grey_door_1 (connects room_1 and room_3), yellow_door_1 (room_2 and room_4), and purple_door_1 (room_3 and room_4). All doors are locked. Since the agent is in room_2, the available doors from here are red_door_1 (to room_1) and yellow_door_1 (to room_4). But both are locked. To unlock a door, the agent needs to be in front of it and toggle it. But to get in front of the door, there must be no object blocking that position.

Looking at room_2's objects: initial state doesn't mention any objects in room_2. Wait, initial state says blue_ball_1, purple_box_1, red_ball_1 are in room_1. In room_3, there's yellow_ball_1, blue_box_1, yellow_ball_2, grey_box_1. In room_4, green_ball_1. So room_2 has no objects. Therefore, the positions in front of doors in room_2 (red_door_1 and yellow_door_1) are not blocked by objects. So the agent can go to those doors.

So the steps would be: from room_2, go to red_door_1 (since that connects to room_1, which is our target), unlock it, then go through to room_1. Then go to the purple_box_1 and be in front of it. But wait, the constraint is that the agent must hold an object at least once. The agent starts not holding anything, so they need to pick up an object at some point.

But the goal doesn't require holding the object, just being in front of the purple box. However, the constraint requires that in at least one state, the agent is holding an object. So the plan must include picking up and possibly dropping an object.

So, possible steps:

1. From room_2, go to red_door_1 (since it connects room_2 and room_1). Preconditions: in room_2, door is red_door_1, and no object is blocking. Since room_2 has no objects, this is possible.

2. Toggle red_door_1 to unlock it.

3. Go through red_door_1 to room_1.

4. Now in room_1. The purple_box_1 is here. But need to be in front of it. So gotoobject purple_box_1 room_1.

But wait, when the agent arrives in room_1 via gotoroom, they are no longer in front of any object. So after entering room_1, they need to go to the purple_box_1.

But also, the constraint requires holding an object. So perhaps after entering room_1, pick up an object (like red_ball_1 or blue_ball_1 or purple_box_1), but boxes might not be pickable. Wait, the actions are "pick x r" where x can be a box or a ball? The problem description says objects are boxes and balls. The preconditions for pick are that you are in the same room as x and not holding anything. So boxes can be picked up? Or are boxes not movable? Wait, the problem statement says "boxes and balls" are objects. The initial state lists boxes in rooms. So boxes can be picked up? The pick action's effect says that x is no longer in the room. So yes, boxes can be picked up and moved.

But the goal requires a purple box in room_1. Since purple_box_1 is already in room_1, maybe we don't need to move it. But the agent needs to be in front of it. So the plan could be:

- Go to room_1 via red_door_1 after unlocking it.

- Then gotoobject purple_box_1 room_1.

But the constraint requires holding an object. So maybe pick up the purple_box_1 and then drop it again? But that would require being in front of it. Wait, the pick action requires being in the same room as x and not holding anything. So after entering room_1, the agent is not holding anything. Then, to pick up purple_box_1, they need to be in front of it. So steps would be:

After entering room_1:

4. gotoobject purple_box_1 room_1.

5. pick purple_box_1 room_1. Now holding it.

6. Then drop it in room_1. But to drop, need to be in front of an empty position. So after picking, the agent is no longer in front of the box. Wait, the effect of pick is that you are no longer in front of x. So after picking, the agent is not in front of anything. Then, they need to gotoempty to be in front of an empty spot, then drop the box there. But then the box would be in room_1, which is already the case. Alternatively, maybe after picking and dropping, the box is still in room_1. But the problem is that the drop action requires being in front of an empty position, which after dropping, the box is placed there.

But the goal requires being in front of the purple box. So after dropping it, the agent would be in front of it again. Let's see:

After step 5 (pick purple_box_1), the agent is holding it. Now, to drop it, the agent needs to gotoempty, then drop. So:

6. gotoempty (in room_1).

7. drop purple_box_1 room_1.

But after dropping, the agent is in front of the purple_box_1. Then, the goal conditions are satisfied: the agent is in room_1, in front of the purple box, which is in room_1 and purple. Also, during step 5, the agent was holding the box, satisfying the constraint.

So the plan would be:

1. gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_1 (since agent is in room_2, and the door connects room_2 and room_1)

Wait, the gotodoor action's arguments are d r1 r2? The action is "gotodoor d r1 r2". The preconditions are that you are in a room connected by door d. So since the agent is in room_2, and red_door_1 connects room_2 and room_1, the correct gotodoor is gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_1.

Then toggle red_door_1.

Then gotoroom room_2 room_1 red_door_1.

Then gotoobject purple_box_1 room_1.

Then pick purple_box_1 room_1.

Then drop purple_box_1 room_1. Wait, but after picking, the agent is not in front of anything, so to drop, they need to be in front of an empty spot. So after picking, they need to gotoempty, then drop.

Wait, the drop action's preconditions are that you are holding the object and the position in front is empty. So after picking, the agent is not in front of any position. So they need to gotoempty to be in front of an empty spot. Then drop.

So steps after entering room_1:

4. gotoobject purple_box_1 room_1.

5. pick purple_box_1 room_1.

6. gotoempty.

7. drop purple_box_1 room_1.

After dropping, the agent is in front of purple_box_1, satisfying the goal.

But wait, when you drop the object, you are in front of it. So after dropping, the agent is in front of x (the purple_box_1). So step 7 would place them in front of it, which is the goal.

So this plan would satisfy the goal. Let's check the constraints.

The constraint is that "you are holding some object" in at least one state. That happens when the agent picks up the purple_box_1. So that's covered.

Now, let's check the door toggling. The initial state has all doors locked. So to go through red_door_1, the agent must first toggle it to unlock.

So step 1: gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_1.

Step 2: toggle red_door_1 (unlocks it).

Step 3: gotoroom room_2 room_1 red_door_1.

Then steps 4-7 as above.

Is there a shorter way? Let's see. Is there a way to avoid picking and dropping the box? For example, perhaps pick another object in room_1, like red_ball_1 or blue_ball_1. Because the constraint just requires holding some object once. So maybe after entering room_1, go to another object, pick it up, then drop it, then go to the purple box.

But that would add more steps, making the plan longer. Since we need the shortest possible plan, the original approach of picking and dropping the purple box is better because it requires fewer steps.

Wait, but if we can just pick up the purple box and then immediately drop it, but the problem is that after picking, the agent is not in front of anything. So to drop, they need to be in front of an empty position. So steps are:

gotoobject -> pick -> gotoempty -> drop.

But if instead, after entering room_1, the agent goes to the purple box, picks it up (satisfying the constraint), then immediately drops it (since after picking, the agent can't drop unless in front of empty spot). So they need to gotoempty first. So the steps are necessary.

Alternatively, perhaps the agent can pick up another object that's in room_1, like red_ball_1 or blue_ball_1, which are also in room_1. Let's see.

After entering room_1, the agent can go to red_ball_1, pick it up, then hold it, then drop it. That would satisfy the constraint. But then the agent still needs to go to the purple box. So steps would be:

4. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_1.

5. pick red_ball_1 room_1.

6. gotoempty.

7. drop red_ball_1 room_1.

8. gotoobject purple_box_1 room_1.

This adds more steps compared to the original plan. So the original plan is shorter.

Thus, the optimal plan would be:

1. gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_1

2. toggle red_door_1

3. gotoroom room_2 room_1 red_door_1

4. gotoobject purple_box_1 room_1

5. pick purple_box_1 room_1

6. gotoempty

7. drop purple_box_1 room_1

This is 7 actions. Let's check if each action's preconditions are met.

1. gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_1: agent is in room_2, which is connected via red_door_1 to room_1. Also, room_2 has no objects blocking the door. So allowed.

2. toggle red_door_1: agent is in front of red_door_1 after step 1. So allowed.

3. gotoroom room_2 room_1 red_door_1: the door is now unlocked (after toggle). So allowed.

4. gotoobject purple_box_1 room_1: agent is in room_1, same as the object. Allowed.

5. pick: in room_1, not holding anything, in front of purple_box_1. Allowed.

6. gotoempty: allowed any time.

7. drop: holding purple_box_1, in front of empty spot. Allowed.

After dropping, the agent is in front of purple_box_1, in room_1. Goal achieved. Also, during step 5, the agent was holding the box, satisfying the constraint.

This seems valid. Now, check if any steps can be removed. For example, after dropping, do we need to go to the box again? No, because when you drop, you are in front of it. So step 7 is drop, which leaves you in front of it, meeting the goal. So the plan is correct.

Another possible optimization: after step 3 (entering room_1), the agent is not in front of anything. So step 4 is necessary to go to the purple box. Then pick, then gotoempty, then drop. That's 4 steps after entering room_1. So total steps are 7. Is there a shorter way?

Alternative: After entering room_1, can the agent be in front of an empty spot? Then drop would require being in front of empty. But since the agent isn't holding anything yet, they can't drop. So no. The steps are necessary.

So the plan is optimal.
