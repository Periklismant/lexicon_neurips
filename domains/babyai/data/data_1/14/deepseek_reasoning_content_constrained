Okay, let's see. I need to solve this planning problem. The goal is to have a blue box in front of me, and I have to be in front of it. The constraints say that at some point in the plan, either the purple_box_1 is in room_3 or the yellow_door_1 is unlocked. Hmm. Let's start by understanding the initial state.

I'm in room_1. The blue boxes in room_1 are blue_box_1 and blue_box_2. So maybe the easiest way is to just go to one of them and drop them? Wait, no. Wait, the goal is that there's a blue box in front of me. So maybe I just need to be in front of one of them. But wait, the initial state has those boxes in room_1. So can I just do "gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1" and then that's it? But wait, what's the problem? Let me check the preconditions for "gotoobject x r". The precondition is that I'm in the same room as x. Since I'm in room_1 and the boxes are there, that's possible. So maybe the plan is just one action: gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1. But wait, the constraints require that at some point either purple_box_1 is in room_3 or yellow_door_1 is unlocked.

In the initial state, purple_box_1 is in room_2, and all doors are locked. So the constraint isn't satisfied initially. So the plan must include an action that either moves purple_box_1 to room_3 or unlocks yellow_door_1. Therefore, even if the goal can be achieved in one step, I need to ensure that in the plan, one of those conditions happens.

So if I just do gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1, the constraint isn't met. Therefore, I need to include some steps that make sure either the purple box is moved to room_3 or unlock yellow_door_1. But how?

Wait, the plan must be valid, meaning that the goal is achieved and all constraints are met. The constraint here is that in at least one state of the plan, either purple_box_1 is in room_3 or yellow_door_1 is not locked. So even if the final state doesn't meet that, as long as during the execution of the plan, one of those conditions is true at some point.

So the plan could be: unlock yellow_door_1, then go to blue_box_1. But unlocking requires toggling it. But how to get to the door to toggle it?

Let me think step by step.

Initial state: I'm in room_1. All doors are locked. To unlock yellow_door_1, which connects room_1 and room_2, I need to first go to the door. To go to the door, I need to use "gotodoor d r1 r2". The preconditions for gotodoor are that I'm in a room connected by d, and that there's no object blocking the position in front of d in my current room. So in room_1, yellow_door_1 connects room_1 and room_2. Are there any objects blocking the door? The initial state says that blue_box_1 and blue_box_2 are in room_1. But do they block the door? Wait, the problem mentions that "if x was blocking some door, then it is no longer blocking that door" when you pick up x. But in the initial state, are any boxes blocking doors? The initial state doesn't mention that any objects are blocking doors. So maybe by default, doors are not blocked. So I can go to the door.

So steps could be:

1. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2 (preconditions: I'm in room_1, which is connected by the door, and no object is blocking the door's position in room_1. Since the initial state doesn't mention any blocking, this should be okay.)

2. toggle yellow_door_1 (since I'm in front of it now, this will unlock it. Because it was locked initially.)

After toggling, yellow_door_1 is unlocked. Then I can proceed to go back to the blue box. Wait, but after toggling, I'm still in room_1, in front of the door. Then I can "gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1". But for that, I need to be in the same room as the object, which I am. So after toggling the door, I can go to the blue box.

So the plan would be:

gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2

toggle yellow_door_1

gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1

But then, after these steps, the goal is achieved (in front of a blue box), and the constraint is met because during the plan, the yellow_door_1 was unlocked. So the toggle action meets the constraint.

But wait, after the toggle, the door is unlocked, which satisfies the constraint. So that's good.

But is there a shorter plan? Let's see. Suppose the plan is:

gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1.

But then the constraint isn't met. So that's invalid. So the plan must include an action that triggers the constraint. So adding the steps to unlock the door is necessary.

Alternatively, could we move the purple_box_1 to room_3? Let's see. How to do that. Purple_box_1 is initially in room_2. To move it to room_3, I need to pick it up, then carry it through doors. But since all doors are locked, I need to unlock them. Let's think:

To get from room_2 to room_3, the path would be room_2 to room_4 via red_door_1, then room_4 to room_3 via green_door_1. But all doors are locked. So first, I need to unlock those doors. But that's a longer path. So perhaps unlocking yellow_door_1 is easier.

Alternatively, maybe moving the purple box is more complicated. So perhaps the minimal plan is to unlock yellow_door_1 and then go to the blue box. Let's check the steps again.

1. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2: requires being in room_1 (which we are), and the door connects room_1 and room_2, and no blocking objects. Since initial state has blue boxes in room_1 but not blocking, so this is allowed.

After this action, I'm in front of yellow_door_1.

2. toggle yellow_door_1: this will unlock it. Now the door is unlocked. So the constraint is met here.

3. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1: since I'm in room_1, I can go to the blue box. After this, I'm in front of it, meeting the goal.

So the plan would be three actions. That's three steps. Is there a shorter way? Let's see. If the initial state had the door unlocked, then maybe a shorter plan, but no. Since the constraint requires that during the plan, either the door is unlocked or the purple box is moved. But moving the purple box would take more steps. So the three-step plan seems optimal.

But wait, after unlocking the door, do I need to go back to room_1? No, because when I go to the door, I'm still in room_1. The gotodoor action doesn't change my current room. The gotoroom action is needed to move between rooms. But in this case, we're not moving rooms. So after toggling the door, I'm still in room_1, in front of the door. Then, to go to the blue box, which is in room_1, I can use the "gotoobject" action. So yes, the steps are correct.

So the plan would be:

gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2

toggle yellow_door_1

gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1

Each action on a separate line. That should satisfy the goal and the constraints. Let's check again.

The goal is that there exists a blue box that I'm in front of. The blue_box_1 is blue and in room_1. After the third action, I'm in front of it. So the goal is achieved.

The constraint is that at some state, either purple_box_1 is in room_3 or yellow_door_1 is not locked. After the toggle action, yellow_door_1 is unlocked. So during the plan, this condition is met. So the plan is valid.

Is there a shorter plan? Suppose there's another way. Let's see. If I can unlock the door as part of the plan. Wait, maybe after unlocking the door, I can just be in front of the blue box. But how?

Alternatively, can I unlock the door while moving? No. The steps have to be sequential.

So yes, three actions. I think this is the minimal plan.
