Let me summarize the problem and come up with a solution:

### Initial State:
- We are in room_1
- There are various objects in different rooms: 
  - blue_ball_1 is in room_1
  - green_box_1 and green_ball_1 are in room_2
  - blue_ball_2, green_box_2, grey_ball_1, grey_box_1, and blue_ball_3 are in room_3
  - (room_4 is empty of objects)
- All doors are locked (purple_door_1, red_door_1, blue_door_1, grey_door_1)
- Door connections:
  - purple_door_1 connects room_1 and room_2
  - red_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3
  - blue_door_1 connects room_2 and room_4
  - grey_door_1 connects room_3 and room_4

### Goal:
- We need to be in front of grey_box_1, which is in room_3

### Constraint:
- red_door_1 must remain locked

So, we need to get from room_1 to room_3 to be in front of the grey box, but we can't use the direct connection via red_door_1 (it must remain locked). This means we need to find an alternative path: room_1 → room_2 → room_4 → room_3.

Let's work out the plan:

1. First, we need to unlock purple_door_1 to get to room_2
2. Then, we need to unlock blue_door_1 to get from room_2 to room_4
3. Finally, we need to unlock grey_door_1 to get from room_4 to room_3
4. Once in room_3, we go to the grey_box_1

Let's create the plan:

```
gotoobject purple_door_1 room_1
toggle purple_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1
gotoobject blue_door_1 room_2
toggle blue_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_4 blue_door_1
gotoobject grey_door_1 room_4
toggle grey_door_1
gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1
gotoobject grey_box_1 room_3
```

Let's review this plan to make sure it satisfies all constraints and works correctly:

1. We start in room_1
2. We go to purple_door_1 and unlock it
3. We go through purple_door_1 to room_2
4. In room_2, we go to blue_door_1 and unlock it
5. We go through blue_door_1 to room_4
6. In room_4, we go to grey_door_1 and unlock it
7. We go through grey_door_1 to room_3
8. In room_3, we go to grey_box_1, which is our target

This plan doesn't use red_door_1 at all, so the constraint that red_door_1 remains locked is satisfied.

Let me check if there are any issues with the plan:

1. Can we go to purple_door_1 from our initial position in room_1? Yes, we're in room_1 and purple_door_1 connects room_1 and room_2.
2. Can we toggle purple_door_1? Yes, since we're in front of it.
3. Can we go to room_2 from room_1 via purple_door_1? Yes, since we just unlocked it.
4. Can we go to blue_door_1 in room_2? Yes, since we're in room_2 and blue_door_1 connects room_2 and room_4.
5. Can we toggle blue_door_1? Yes, since we're in front of it.
6. Can we go to room_4 from room_2 via blue_door_1? Yes, since we just unlocked it.
7. Can we go to grey_door_1 in room_4? Yes, since we're in room_4 and grey_door_1 connects room_4 and room_3.
8. Can we toggle grey_door_1? Yes, since we're in front of it.
9. Can we go to room_3 from room_4 via grey_door_1? Yes, since we just unlocked it.
10. Can we go to grey_box_1 in room_3? Yes, since we're in room_3 and grey_box_1 is in room_3.

The plan seems valid. Let's finalize it:

```
gotoobject purple_door_1 room_1
toggle purple_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1
gotoobject blue_door_1 room_2
toggle blue_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_4 blue_door_1
gotoobject grey_door_1 room_4
toggle grey_door_1
gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1
gotoobject grey_box_1 room_3
```

Wait, let me reconsider the "gotoobject" action. The precondition states:
"goto object": you may only go in front of an object x if you are in the same room as x.

In this case, I need to make sure I can go in front of the doors from my starting position. Let's check again:

1. Can I go to purple_door_1 from my initial position in room_1? Yes, since both I and purple_door_1 are in room_1 (or rather, purple_door_1 connects room_1 to another room, so it's accessible from room_1).
2. The rest of the plan should work similarly.

Actually, let me check and make sure that the preconditions and effects of "gotodoor" and "gotoobject" actions match what I'm describing here.

For "gotodoor d r1 r2", the preconditions are:
(i) you are in a room which door d is connecting with another room, and 
(ii) there is no object blocking the position in front of d in the room you are currently in.

So I need to use "gotodoor" rather than "gotoobject" to go to a door. Let me redo the plan:

```
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2
toggle purple_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1
gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_4
toggle blue_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_4 blue_door_1
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3
toggle grey_door_1
gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1
gotoobject grey_box_1 room_3
```

Let me double-check this again to make sure it's valid.

Actually, let's think about this a bit more. According to the problem description, the following conditions need to be satisfied for "gotodoor":

i) you are in a room which door d is connecting with another room, and (ii) there is no object blocking the position in front of d in the room you are currently in.

For the first "gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2" action, we're in room_1, and purple_door_1 connects room_1 and room_2, so the first precondition is met. There's no mention of any object blocking purple_door_1, so I'll assume the second precondition is also met.

The rest of the "gotodoor" actions should work similarly, assuming no objects are blocking the doors.

The plan seems correct, but let me make a final check for any missed details...

Actually, I just realized that we might need to handle objects blocking the doors. Let me check if any object is mentioned as blocking a door in the initial state... I don't see any explicit mention of objects blocking doors in the initial state, so I'll assume no doors are blocked initially.

Alright, the plan looks valid:

```
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2
toggle purple_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1
gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_4
toggle blue_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_4 blue_door_1
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3
toggle grey_door_1
gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1
gotoobject grey_box_1 room_3
```

This should allow us to reach the grey_box_1 in room_3 without unlocking red_door_1, which satisfies the constraint.
