Okay, let's tackle this planning problem step by step. The goal is to get a grey box in front of me while ensuring the red door stays locked the whole time. Let me start by understanding the initial state and the constraints.

First, the initial state: I'm in room_1. The grey box (grey_box_1) is in room_3. All doors are locked initially, including red_door_1, which must remain locked. So I can't use red_door_1 to go from room_1 to room_3, because that would require unlocking it, which might toggle it to unlocked, violating the constraint. Wait, the constraint says red_door_1 must stay locked in every state. So I can't toggle it at all. Because if I toggle it, it would unlock it, which is not allowed. So I need to find another path to room_3 without using red_door_1.

Looking at the door connections: room_1 connects to room_2 via purple_door_1, and to room_3 via red_door_1. Room_2 connects to room_4 via blue_door_1. Room_3 connects to room_4 via grey_door_1. So maybe a path from room_1 to room_2, then to room_4, then to room_3 via grey_door_1. But all doors are locked initially. So I need to unlock doors except red_door_1.

But how? Let's see. Starting in room_1. Purple_door_1 connects room_1 and room_2. It's locked. To go to room_2, I need to unlock purple_door_1. But first, I have to go in front of the door. Wait, to toggle a door, I need to be in front of it. So maybe: goto door purple_door_1 room_1 room_2, then toggle it. But is there any object blocking the door in room_1? The initial state in room_1 has blue_ball_1. So unless blue_ball_1 is blocking purple_door_1, but the problem statement doesn't mention objects blocking doors unless they are in front of them. The "blocking" condition for goto door action is if there's an object in front of the door. So if in room_1, the position in front of purple_door_1 is blocked by an object, then I can't go there. But the initial objects in room_1 are blue_ball_1. Where is it located? The problem doesn't specify positions, but the "gotoobject" action implies that objects are in specific positions. So if blue_ball_1 is in room_1, but not blocking the door, then I can go to the door.

Assuming that, the steps would be:

1. Goto door purple_door_1 in room_1. Then toggle it to unlock. Then go to room_2.

Once in room_2, there's green_box_1 and green_ball_1. Then, need to go to room_4. For that, blue_door_1 connects room_2 and room_4. It's locked. So similar steps: goto blue_door_1 in room_2, toggle it, then go to room_4.

Then, from room_4, go to room_3 via grey_door_1. But grey_door_1 is locked. So goto grey_door_1 in room_4 (since room_4 is connected to room_3 via grey_door_1), toggle it, then go to room_3.

Once in room_3, there's grey_box_1. Need to go to it and be in front of it. Then the goal is achieved.

Wait, the goal is "there is a box v such that v is grey and you are in front of v". So grey_box_1 is in room_3. So I need to be in room_3 and in front of grey_box_1.

But how to get to room_3 without unlocking red_door_1. The path via room_4 seems possible. Let's outline the steps:

1. In room_1: go to purple_door_1 (room_1 and room_2). Precondition: in room_1. So action: gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2. Then toggle purple_door_1 (unlock it). Then gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1.

2. Now in room_2. Next, go to blue_door_1 (room_2 and room_4). Action: gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_4. Then toggle blue_door_1 (unlock). Then gotoroom room_2 room_4 blue_door_1.

3. Now in room_4. Then go to grey_door_1 (room_4 and room_3). Action: gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3. Toggle it (unlock), then gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1.

4. Now in room_3. Then gotoobject grey_box_1 in room_3. Then the goal is achieved.

But wait, the problem requires that the final state has me in front of the grey box. So after entering room_3, I need to perform gotoobject grey_box_1 room_3.

But let's check each step's preconditions and effects.

Step 1: From room_1. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2. Preconditions: in a room connected by the door (yes, room_1 is connected via purple_door_1 to room_2) and no object blocking the position in front of d in current room (room_1). The objects in room_1 are blue_ball_1. If blue_ball_1 is not blocking the door's position, then this action is possible. Assuming it's allowed.

After that, toggle purple_door_1. Since it's locked, toggling unlocks it. Then, gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1. Precondition: door is unlocked (yes, after toggle). Then moving to room_2.

Step 2: In room_2, gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_4. Precondition: in room connected by the door (yes, room_2 and room_4 via blue_door_1). Any object blocking? The initial objects in room_2 are green_box_1 and green_ball_1. If they are not in front of blue_door_1, then allowed. Then toggle blue_door_1 to unlock. Then gotoroom room_2 room_4 blue_door_1.

Step 3: In room_4, gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3. Then toggle it (unlock). Then gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1.

Step 4: In room_3, gotoobject grey_box_1 room_3. Since I'm in room_3 and the box is there, this is allowed. Then I'm in front of the grey box, which satisfies the goal.

But wait, the goal is "there is a box v such that v is grey and you are in front of v". So the final action would be to gotoobject grey_box_1 room_3. That's the last step.

But need to check all constraints. The main constraint is that red_door_1 remains locked at all times. Since the initial state has red_door_1 locked, and we never interact with it (since the path doesn't go through it), this should be okay. All actions involve other doors, so red_door_1 stays locked.

Now, let's check if all actions are valid.

Another possible issue: when moving between rooms, do we need to go to the door each time before moving? For example, after toggling a door, you need to be in front of it to move through. Because gotoroom's precondition is that you are in a room connected via the door, and the door is unlocked.

Wait, the gotoroom action's preconditions are (i) current room is adjacent via the door, (ii) door is unlocked. The gotoroom action is "gotoroom r1 r2 d": go from r1 to r2 using door d. So the steps would be:

After toggling the door to unlock it, you need to be in front of the door to use gotoroom? Or can you be anywhere in the room?

Wait, the gotoroom action's preconditions don't mention being in front of the door. The gotoroom action's effect is that you leave the current room, enter the new room, and are no longer in front of any object or door. So perhaps the gotoroom action can be done as long as you're in the starting room and the door is unlocked. But according to the problem description, the gotoroom action's preconditions are (i) in r0 adjacent to r via door d, (ii) door is unlocked. So maybe you can perform gotoroom from any position in the room as long as those two conditions are met.

Wait, but in that case, how do you get in front of the door? The gotoroom action doesn't require being in front of the door. So maybe the sequence is:

1. In room_1, need to unlock purple_door_1. To toggle it, you need to be in front of it. So first, goto door purple_door_1 room_1 room_2. Then toggle. Then gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1.

Yes, because after toggling, the door is unlocked, then you can move through it. So the steps would be:

1. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2
2. toggle purple_door_1
3. gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1

Similarly for the other doors.

So putting it all together:

Plan steps:

1. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2
2. toggle purple_door_1
3. gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1
4. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_4
5. toggle blue_door_1
6. gotoroom room_2 room_4 blue_door_1
7. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3
8. toggle grey_door_1
9. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1
10. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_3

Now check each action's preconditions and effects:

1. gotodoor: in room_1, which is connected via purple_door_1. No blocking objects. Valid.
2. toggle: in front of purple_door_1. Valid. Now door is unlocked.
3. gotoroom: from room_1 to room_2 via purple_door_1 (unlocked). Valid. Now in room_2, not in front of anything.
4. gotodoor blue_door_1 in room_2. Valid if no objects blocking. Room_2 has green_box_1 and green_ball_1. Assuming they don't block the door. Then valid.
5. toggle blue_door_1: now unlocked.
6. gotoroom to room_4. Valid.
7. gotodoor grey_door_1 in room_4. Valid if no blocking objects. Room_4's initial state isn't given, but assuming no objects are there (since the problem's initial state lists objects only up to room_3). So possible.
8. toggle grey_door_1: unlocks it.
9. gotoroom to room_3. Now in room_3.
10. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_3: since in room_3 and grey_box_1 is there. Valid. Now in front of grey_box_1, which is a grey box. Goal achieved.

All steps don't involve red_door_1, so it remains locked. The constraints are satisfied.

Now, is there a shorter path? Let's see. For example, can we avoid toggling some doors? Since all doors start locked, and we need to pass through them, we have to unlock them. So each door on the path must be toggled. The path from room_1 to room_2 to room_4 to room_3 requires three doors: purple, blue, and grey. Each must be unlocked. So the steps are necessary. Therefore, this plan is optimal.
