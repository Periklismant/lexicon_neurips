Let me understand the problem:

1. I'm in a 2D gridworld with 4 rooms arranged in a square formation.
2. I have various actions available: gotoobject, gotoempty, gotodoor, gotoroom, pick, drop, and toggle.
3. The world includes several objects: rooms, doors of different colors, balls, and boxes.
4. There are conditions for performing actions and effects after performing them.

Starting state:
- I am in room_4
- Various balls and boxes are in different rooms
- All doors are locked
- I am not holding any object
- I have visited room_4

Goal:
"There is a door d such that "The following conditions are all true: "d is yellow", "you are in front of d", "d is not locked"""

Constraints:
1. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: "yellow_door_1 is locked""
2. "If expression "yellow_door_1 is locked" holds in some state s, then expression "At least one of the following conditions is true: "purple_door_1 is not locked", "blue_door_1 is not locked"" must hold at s or at some state after s"

So, I need to:
- Find a yellow door (which is yellow_door_1)
- Go in front of it
- Make sure it's unlocked
- Meet the constraints: At some point, yellow_door_1 should be locked, and if yellow_door_1 is locked, then either purple_door_1 or blue_door_1 should be unlocked at that time or later.

The initial state already satisfies the first constraint since yellow_door_1 is locked. The second constraint means I will need to unlock either purple_door_1 or blue_door_1 before or at the same time I unlock yellow_door_1.

Let's think about the room layout:
- room_1 (NW) --- purple_door_1 --- room_3 (NE)
      |                                |
      |                                |
green_door_1                        blue_door_1
      |                                |
      |                                |
- room_2 (SW) --- yellow_door_1 --- room_4 (SE)

I'm currently in room_4 (SE). 

The goal is to be in front of the yellow door (yellow_door_1) and have it unlocked. Yellow_door_1 connects room_2 and room_4. 

Step 1: I need to find and go in front of yellow_door_1 from room_4.
Step 2: I need to unlock either purple_door_1 or blue_door_1 before unlocking yellow_door_1, as per the constraint.
Step 3: I will then unlock yellow_door_1.

Blue_door_1 connects room_3 and room_4, while purple_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3. To reach either of these doors, I need to go to the respective rooms.

Given that I'm in room_4, it's simpler to go for blue_door_1 first (connecting room_3 and room_4).

Let's draft a plan:

1. "gotodoor blue_door_1 room_4 room_3" - Go in front of blue_door_1 in room_4.
2. "toggle blue_door_1" - Unlock blue_door_1.
3. "gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_2" - Go in front of yellow_door_1 in room_4.
4. "toggle yellow_door_1" - Unlock yellow_door_1.

Now let me check if this plan meets the constraints:

1. "yellow_door_1 is locked" holds in the initial state and all states before Step 4. ✓
2. "blue_door_1 is not locked" holds after Step 2, which is before Step 4 (when yellow_door_1 becomes unlocked). ✓

Actually, there's an issue with the plan above. I need to be more precise about the movement in the gridworld.

First, I need to go to the door, then toggle it:

1. "gotodoor blue_door_1 room_4 room_3" - Go in front of blue_door_1 in room_4.
2. "toggle blue_door_1" - Unlock blue_door_1.
3. "gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_2" - Go in front of yellow_door_1 in room_4.
4. "toggle yellow_door_1" - Unlock yellow_door_1.

Hmm, upon reflection, I think I've misunderstood some actions. The "gotodoor" action doesn't move me to the door directly from anywhere in the room; it moves me in front of the door if I'm in a room that the door connects to. 

Let me revise my understanding:

- "gotodoor d r1 r2": Go in front of door d, which connects room r1 to room r2. I need to be in either r1 or r2 to do this.
- "toggle d": Unlock or lock door d. I need to be in front of d to do this.
- "gotoroom r1 r2 d": Go from room r1 to room r2 using door d. The door needs to be unlocked for this.

Starting from room_4, I have access to yellow_door_1 (connects to room_2) and blue_door_1 (connects to room_3).

Given the constraints, I need to unlock either blue_door_1 or purple_door_1 before or at the same time as unlocking yellow_door_1. Since I'm in room_4, it's easier to go for blue_door_1.

Revised plan:

1. "gotodoor blue_door_1 room_4 room_3" - Go in front of blue_door_1.
2. "toggle blue_door_1" - Unlock blue_door_1.
3. "gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_2" - Go in front of yellow_door_1.
4. "toggle yellow_door_1" - Unlock yellow_door_1.

Now, checking if this plan meets the goal and constraints:

- Goal: I'm in front of yellow_door_1 and it's unlocked. ✓
- Constraints: yellow_door_1 is locked in the initial state and all states before Step 4. blue_door_1 is unlocked after Step 2, which is before Step 4. ✓

Actually, I realized I might be misinterpreting the actions. Let me review again.

- From "gotodoor": "you may only go in front of a door d if (i) you are in a room which door d is connecting with another room, and (ii) there is no object blocking the position in front of d in the room you are currently in."
- From "toggle": "you may only toggle a door d if you are in front of d."

So, I'm in room_4, and yellow_door_1 and blue_door_1 are connecting room_4 with room_2 and room_3, respectively. I can go in front of either of these doors.

Ok, my plan seems correct:

1. "gotodoor blue_door_1 room_4 room_3" - Go in front of blue_door_1 from room_4.
2. "toggle blue_door_1" - Unlock blue_door_1.
3. "gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_2" - Go in front of yellow_door_1 from room_4.
4. "toggle yellow_door_1" - Unlock yellow_door_1.

But there's something I'm still uncertain about. Let me double-check the effect of "gotodoor":

- From "gotodoor": "After performing this action regarding a door d, (i) if you were in front of some object or door x0, then you are no longer in front of x0 and (ii) you are in front of door d."

So, after Step 1, I'm in front of blue_door_1. After Step 3, I'm in front of yellow_door_1. This might mean I'll lose the effect of Step 2 (unlocking blue_door_1) after moving away from it. However, I believe the effects of "toggle" are permanent.

My above plan should work, but let me double-check by analyzing step by step:

1. "gotodoor blue_door_1 room_4 room_3": I go from room_4 to in front of blue_door_1. I'm now in room_4 and in front of blue_door_1.
2. "toggle blue_door_1": I unlock blue_door_1. blue_door_1 is now unlocked.
3. "gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_2": I go from in front of blue_door_1 to in front of yellow_door_1. I'm now in room_4 and in front of yellow_door_1. blue_door_1 is still unlocked.
4. "toggle yellow_door_1": I unlock yellow_door_1. yellow_door_1 is now unlocked.

This plan should satisfy the goal and constraints. The goal is achieved in the final state, and the constraints are satisfied throughout. Now let me double check if it's valid accoridng to the domain rules.

1. "gotodoor blue_door_1 room_4 room_3"
   
   Precondition: We need to be in room_4 (✓ as per the initial state) and there should be no object blocking the position in front of blue_door_1 in room_4.

   Effect: We are now in front of blue_door_1 and no longer in front of any other object (if we were).

2. "toggle blue_door_1"
   
   Precondition: We need to be in front of blue_door_1 (✓ as per the previous action).

   Effect: blue_door_1 is now unlocked.

3. "gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_2"
   
   Precondition: We need to be in room_4 (✓ as per the initial state and not changed), and there should be no object blocking the position in front of yellow_door_1 in room_4.

   Effect: We are now in front of yellow_door_1 and no longer in front of blue_door_1.

4. "toggle yellow_door_1"
   
   Precondition: We need to be in front of yellow_door_1 (✓ as per the previous action).

   Effect: yellow_door_1 is now unlocked.

Alright, let's summarize our plan:

```
gotodoor blue_door_1 room_4 room_3
toggle blue_door_1
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_2
toggle yellow_door_1
```

This plan should achieve the goal, satisfy the constraints, and be valid according to the domain rules.

Actually, reading the goal statement one more time:
"There is a door d such that "The following conditions are all true: "d is yellow", "you are in front of d", "d is not locked"""
It only requires there to be *a* yellow door that is unlocked and I'm in front of. It doesn't specify which one. But there's only one yellow door, yellow_door_1, so it still is the goal.

Let me check once more if this plan meets the goal and constraints:

Goal: After executing the plan, I'm in front of yellow_door_1 and it's unlocked. yellow_door_1 is yellow. ✓

Constraints:
1. "yellow_door_1 is locked" holds in the initial state and all states before the last step. ✓
2. "blue_door_1 is not locked" holds after the second step, which is before the last step. ✓

My plan is:

```
gotodoor blue_door_1 room_4 room_3
toggle blue_door_1
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_2
toggle yellow_door_1
```

This looks right to me.

Wait, I need to recheck what "gotodoor" does:

"gotodoor d r1 r2": Go in front of door d, connecting room r1 to room r2.

The syntax makes it seem like the door should connect room r1 to room r2 as a condition, so it would be "gotodoor blue_door_1 room_4 room_3", but this conflicts with the preconditions which just say you need to be in a room connected by that door. This makes me wonder if I need to specify directions (like "gotodoor blue_door_1 from room_4 to room_3"), or if it's just "gotodoor blue_door_1".

Let me re-read the precondition just to be sure:

"goto door": you may only go in front of a door d if (i) you are in a room which door d is connecting with another room, and (ii) there is no object blocking the position in front of d in the room you are currently in.

So for "gotodoor blue_door_1", I need to be in either room_3 or room_4 (which I am, I'm in room_4) and there should be no object blocking the door in room_4.

Since I need to be precise, I think "gotodoor blue_door_1 room_4 room_3" is correct. It specifies that I'm going to the door blue_door_1, which connects room_4 (where I am) to room_3. The "room_4 room_3" part might just serve as a clarification of which door I'm referring to, not as a direction of movement.

I'm still a bit unsure about the exact syntax, but let's go with "gotodoor blue_door_1 room_4 room_3" since it seems to be the most logical interpretation.

Final plan:

```
gotodoor blue_door_1 room_4 room_3
toggle blue_door_1
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_2
toggle yellow_door_1
```

Hmm, but looking again at the domain, the action is explained as: "gotodoor d r1 r2": Go in front of door d, connecting room r1 to room r2.

It's not entirely clear to me if r1 must be the room I'm currently in, or if it's just a clarification of which door I'm referring to. But earlier, it says: "you may only go in front of a door d if (i) you are in a room which door d is connecting with another room". This implies I need to be in one of the rooms connected by the door, but doesn't specify which one should be r1 or r2.

Given the symmetry of the explanation, I'm interpreting it as the order of r1 and r2 not mattering as long as I'm in one of those rooms and the door connects them. Since the problem statement explicitly gives the syntax as "gotodoor d r1 r2", I'll stick with that.

Final plan:

```
gotodoor blue_door_1 room_4 room_3
toggle blue_door_1
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_2
toggle yellow_door_1
```

Ok I think this is the right syntax. In fact, the facts that are given explicitly tell us how this is encoded:

"room_2 and room_1 are connected via green_door_1"
"room_1 and room_2 are connected via green_door_1"
"room_3 and room_1 are connected via purple_door_1"
"room_1 and room_3 are connected via purple_door_1"
"room_4 and room_2 are connected via yellow_door_1"
"room_2 and room_4 are connected via yellow_door_1"
"room_4 and room_3 are connected via blue_door_1"
"room_3 and room_4 are connected via blue_door_1"

So we're given how the rooms are connected and the order doesn't matter (since they're listed both ways). Now for the action syntax, I suspect "gotodoor d r1 r2" means go to door d, which connects room r1 to room r2. Hence, my action should be:

1. "gotodoor blue_door_1 room_4 room_3" - Go to the door blue_door_1, which connects room_4 to room_3.
2. "toggle blue_door_1" - Unlock blue_door_1.
3. "gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_2" - Go to the door yellow_door_1, which connects room_4 to room_2.
4. "toggle yellow_door_1" - Unlock yellow_door_1.

Yes, I think this is the right syntax for the actions. In fact, looking at the example given for the action:

"goto door": you may only go in front of a door d if (i) you are in a room which door d is connecting with another room, and (ii) there is no object blocking the position in front of d in the room you are currently in.

This doesn't explicitly use the action syntax, but it does clarify what "gotodoor" means. It's to go in front of a door.

I believe my final plan is correct:

```
gotodoor blue_door_1 room_4 room_3
toggle blue_door_1
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_2
toggle yellow_door_1
```

Let's do the final check:

1. "gotodoor blue_door_1 room_4 room_3": 
   - Precondition: I'm in room_4, which is connected to room_3 via blue_door_1. There's no object blocking the door. ✓
   - Effect: I'm in front of blue_door_1. ✓
   
2. "toggle blue_door_1":
   - Precondition: I'm in front of blue_door_1. ✓
   - Effect: blue_door_1 changes from locked to unlocked. ✓
   
3. "gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_2":
   - Precondition: I'm in room_4, which is connected to room_2 via yellow_door_1. There's no object blocking the door. ✓
   - Effect: I'm in front of yellow_door_1 and no longer in front of blue_door_1. ✓
   
4. "toggle yellow_door_1":
   - Precondition: I'm in front of yellow_door_1. ✓
   - Effect: yellow_door_1 changes from locked to unlocked. ✓

The goal is satisfied in the final state: I'm in front of yellow_door_1, and it's unlocked. yellow_door_1 is yellow. ✓

The constraints are satisfied:
1. "yellow_door_1 is locked" holds in the initial state and all states before the last step. ✓
2. "blue_door_1 is not locked" holds after the second step, which is before the last step (when yellow_door_1 becomes unlocked). ✓

This plan is valid and optimal.

```
gotodoor blue_door_1 room_4 room_3
toggle blue_door_1
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_2
toggle yellow_door_1
```
