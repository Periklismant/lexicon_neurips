Okay, let's try to figure out how to solve this planning problem. The goal is to be in front of a green door that connects room_4 and room_2, which is unlocked. The constraints say that green_door_1 must be unlocked at some point, and whenever it's unlocked, there must have been a state where yellow_box_1 was in room_4 before that. 

First, the initial state: I'm in room_4. All doors are locked. The green_door_1 connects room_2 and room_4. So to get to green_door_1, I need to be in room_4 or room_2. But since I'm in room_4, maybe I can go directly to that door. But first, I need to unlock it. To toggle a door, I need to be in front of it. But the doors are locked, so I need to unlock them. However, green_door_1 is locked. So, steps might involve unlocking it. But wait, the constraints require that before unlocking green_door_1, the yellow_box_1 must be in room_4. 

Yellow_box_1 is initially in room_2. So I need to move it to room_4. But how? To move it, I need to pick it up and drop it in room_4. But since I'm starting in room_4, I need to get to room_2 first. Let's see the doors. From room_4, connected via green_door_1 to room_2, but that's locked. Also, room_4 is connected to room_3 via grey_door_2, which is also locked. Hmm. So all doors are locked. So I need to unlock some doors to move around.

Wait, maybe there's another way. Let's look at the doors. The doors are:

- grey_door_1 connects room_1 and room_2.

- yellow_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3.

- green_door_1 connects room_2 and room_4.

- grey_door_2 connects room_3 and room_4.

All doors are locked initially. So to move between rooms, I need to unlock doors. But to unlock a door, I need to be in front of it, which requires being in a room connected by that door.

Starting in room_4. So the doors connected to room_4 are green_door_1 (to room_2) and grey_door_2 (to room_3). Both are locked. So I can't go through them yet. Wait, but to unlock a door, I need to be in front of it. So maybe I can go to the door in room_4, unlock it, then go through.

Wait, but to go to the door, I need to be in the same room as the door's connecting room. For example, to go to green_door_1 from room_4, since green_door_1 connects room_4 and room_2, I can goto door green_door_1 from room_4. But the precondition for "gotodoor" is that I'm in a room connected by the door. So yes, I'm in room_4, which is connected via green_door_1 to room_2. But the door is locked. However, the "gotodoor" action's precondition is that there's no object blocking the position in front of the door. Are there any objects blocking the door? The initial state doesn't mention any objects blocking doors, except maybe boxes or balls. Let me check the initial objects.

In room_4, there's grey_ball_1 and grey_box_2. Are they blocking doors? The initial state doesn't say anything about objects blocking doors. The problem statement mentions that doors may be blocked by objects, but the initial state doesn't specify any. So I assume that the doors aren't blocked. So I can goto the green_door_1 from room_4. Then toggle it to unlock. But wait, the door is locked, so toggling it would unlock it. Then I can go to room_2 through green_door_1. Once in room_2, I can get the yellow_box_1. But according to the constraint, before green_door_1 is unlocked, the yellow_box_1 must have been in room_4. Wait, the constraint says that if green_door_1 is not locked in some state, there must be an earlier state where yellow_box_1 is in room_4. So we need to have yellow_box_1 in room_4 before unlocking green_door_1. But how can yellow_box_1 be in room_4 before unlocking the door? Because yellow_box_1 is in room_2 initially. So I need to move it to room_4 before unlocking green_door_1. But how do I get to room_2 to pick it up if the green_door_1 is locked? Unless there's another path.

Wait, maybe via other doors. Let's see. From room_4, can I get to room_3 via grey_door_2? But that door is also locked. So if I can unlock grey_door_2 first, then go to room_3, then maybe go to room_1 via yellow_door_1 (if I can unlock that), then room_1 to room_2 via grey_door_1, but that's locked as well. This seems complicated. Let's outline possible steps.

Alternative plan: 

1. Unlock grey_door_2 (connecting room_4 and room_3) so that I can go to room_3.

But to unlock grey_door_2, I need to be in front of it. So from room_4, goto door grey_door_2 (room_4 to room_3), then toggle it. That would unlock it. Then go to room_3. Then in room_3, there's the yellow_door_1 connecting to room_1. But that's locked. So maybe unlock that door as well. Then go to room_1, then unlock grey_door_1 (connecting room_1 and room_2), then go to room_2, pick up yellow_box_1, bring it back through the doors to room_4. Then once yellow_box_1 is in room_4, unlock green_door_1 (which is in room_4 and room_2), then go in front of it and make sure it's unlocked. But this seems like a long path. Let's see if that's necessary.

Wait, the goal is to have a green door connecting room_4 and room_2 (which is green_door_1), be in front of it, and have it unlocked. So the final state requires being in front of green_door_1, which is unlocked. So steps could be:

- Unlock green_door_1.

But to unlock it, I need to be in front of it. So from room_4, goto door green_door_1 (room_4 and room_2). Then toggle it (unlock). However, the constraint says that when green_door_1 is unlocked (i.e., in any state where it's not locked), there must have been a previous state where yellow_box_1 was in room_4. So before unlocking green_door_1, we need to have yellow_box_1 in room_4. But how to get yellow_box_1 from room_2 to room_4, since all doors are locked initially. So to move the box, I need to get to room_2, pick it up, and then bring it back to room_4. But how to get to room_2?

The doors to room_2 are grey_door_1 (room_1 and room_2) and green_door_1 (room_2 and room_4). So from room_4, the green_door_1 is locked. So maybe I need to take a detour through other rooms.

Alternative approach:

1. From room_4, unlock grey_door_2 (room_4 to room_3) by going to it and toggling.

2. Gotoroom room_4 to room_3 via grey_door_2.

3. In room_3, unlock yellow_door_1 (connects to room_1) by going to it and toggling.

4. Gotoroom room_3 to room_1 via yellow_door_1.

5. In room_1, unlock grey_door_1 (connects to room_2) by going to it and toggling.

6. Gotoroom room_1 to room_2 via grey_door_1.

7. Now in room_2, pick up yellow_box_1.

8. Need to bring it back to room_4. So go back through grey_door_1 to room_1, then through yellow_door_1 to room_3, then through grey_door_2 to room_4. Then drop the box in room_4. Now, yellow_box_1 is in room_4. 

9. Now, unlock green_door_1 by going to it from room_4 and toggling (since it's locked, this would unlock it).

10. Then, goto green_door_1 again (since after toggling, it's unlocked) and ensure that the final state is being in front of it while it's unlocked.

But wait, after step 9, when we toggle green_door_1, it becomes unlocked. Then, we can be in front of it. So the final action would be to goto door green_door_1 and then ensure that it's unlocked. 

Wait, but the final goal is to have a door d (which is green, connects room_4 and room_2, you are in front of d, and d is not locked). So after unlocking green_door_1, we need to be in front of it. So step 9 would be to unlock it (toggle), and step 10 would be to goto door again. Or maybe after unlocking, we're already in front of it. Let me check the effects of toggle. The toggle action's effect is to unlock if locked, and lock if unlocked. So if we go to the door, then toggle it (unlocking), then we are still in front of the door. Then the next action could be to stay there. Wait, but the plan needs to end with being in front of the unlocked door. So the sequence would be:

- goto door green_door_1 (from room_4)

- toggle (unlocks it)

- Now, the door is unlocked and you're in front of it. So that's the goal. But wait, the toggle action requires being in front of the door. So after gotodoor, you are in front of it. Then toggle unlocks it. Then you are still in front of it. So the final state would be achieved after these two steps. However, we have to ensure that before unlocking green_door_1, the yellow_box_1 was in room_4. So steps 1-8 are moving the box, then step 9 is unlocking the door. But how does that fit?

Wait, let's outline the steps:

1. Unlock grey_door_2 (from room_4 to room_3).

   Action: gotodoor grey_door_2 room_4 room_3

   Action: toggle grey_door_2

2. Go to room_3.

   Action: gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_2

3. Unlock yellow_door_1 (room_3 to room_1).

   Action: gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1

   Action: toggle yellow_door_1

4. Go to room_1.

   Action: gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_1

5. Unlock grey_door_1 (room_1 to room_2).

   Action: gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2

   Action: toggle grey_door_1

6. Go to room_2.

   Action: gotoroom room_1 room_2 grey_door_1

7. Pick up yellow_box_1 in room_2.

   Action: gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_2

   Action: pick yellow_box_1 room_2

8. Return to room_4 via the same path:

   a. Go back to room_1 via grey_door_1.

      Action: gotoroom room_2 room_1 grey_door_1

   b. Go to room_3 via yellow_door_1.

      Action: gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1

   c. Go to room_4 via grey_door_2.

      Action: gotoroom room_3 room_4 grey_door_2

9. Drop yellow_box_1 in room_4.

   Action: gotoempty (to have a position to drop)

   Action: drop yellow_box_1 room_4

Now, yellow_box_1 is in room_4. 

10. Now, unlock green_door_1 (which connects room_4 and room_2):

    Action: gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2

    Action: toggle green_door_1 (unlocks it)

11. Now, we are in front of green_door_1, which is unlocked. This satisfies the goal.

But wait, after step 10, after toggling, the door is unlocked, and the agent is in front of it. So steps 10 and 11 are:

10. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2

11. toggle green_door_1

After toggle, the door is unlocked. And the agent is still in front of it. So the final state is achieved. Also, the constraint says that whenever green_door_1 is unlocked (which happens here), there was an earlier state where yellow_box_1 was in room_4 (step 9). So this satisfies the constraints.

But let's check if all actions are valid:

- When moving from room_4 to room_3 via grey_door_2: need to unlock it first. Which is done in step 1.

- When moving back, same doors are already unlocked.

- When picking up the box, need to be in the same room as the box (room_2) and not holding anything. That's correct.

- Dropping the box in room_4 requires holding it and being in room_4. After dropping, the box is in room_4.

Yes, this seems to work. The plan has the necessary steps to move the box to room_4 before unlocking green_door_1.

Now, let's write out the actions step by step, making sure each action's preconditions are met.

1. gotodoor grey_door_2 room_4 room_3

   Preconditions: in room_4 (yes), door connects room_4 and room_3 (yes), no object blocking. Assuming no blocking.

2. toggle grey_door_2

   Pre: in front of grey_door_2. After step 1, yes.

3. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_2

   Pre: in room_4, adjacent to room_3 via grey_door_2, door unlocked (now yes, since step 2 toggled it to unlocked.

4. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1

   Pre: in room_3, door connects to room_1, no blocking.

5. toggle yellow_door_1

6. gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_1

7. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2

8. toggle grey_door_1

9. gotoroom room_1 room_2 grey_door_1

10. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_2

11. pick yellow_box_1 room_2

12. gotoroom room_2 room_1 grey_door_1

13. gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1

14. gotoroom room_3 room_4 grey_door_2

15. gotoempty room_4

16. drop yellow_box_1 room_4

17. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2

18. toggle green_door_1

Let me check each action:

Action 1: gotodoor grey_door_2 room_4 room_3. Correct.

Action 2: toggle grey_door_2. Now unlocked.

Action 3: go to room_3.

Action 4: gotodoor yellow_door_1 (room_3 to room_1). Correct.

Action 5: toggle unlocks it.

Action 6: go to room_1.

Action 7: gotodoor grey_door_1 (room_1 to room_2). Correct.

Action 8: toggle unlocks it.

Action 9: go to room_2.

Action 10: gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_2. Since in room_2, correct.

Action 11: pick up. Hands are empty.

Action 12: go back to room_1 via grey_door_1 (unlocked).

Action 13: go to room_3 via yellow_door_1 (unlocked).

Action 14: go to room_4 via grey_door_2 (unlocked).

Action 15: gotoempty in room_4 to have a spot to drop.

Action 16: drop the box. Now, yellow_box_1 is in room_4.

Action 17: gotodoor green_door_1 in room_4. Correct.

Action 18: toggle to unlock. Now, green_door_1 is unlocked and agent is in front of it.

This satisfies the goal. Also, the constraint is met because yellow_box_1 was moved to room_4 before green_door_1 was unlocked.

Now, check if the plan is optimal. Are there shorter paths?

Alternative idea: Maybe there's a way to unlock green_door_1 first, but the constraint requires that yellow_box_1 is in room_4 before green_door_1 is unlocked. So if you can move the box through another path. But given that all doors are locked initially, I don't see a shorter path than the one outlined. Therefore, this plan should be optimal.
