Let me break down the problem:

1. I am an agent in a 2D gridworld with 4 rooms arranged in a square: room_1 (NW), room_2 (SW), room_3 (NE), room_4 (SE).
2. There are 4 doors connecting the rooms: room_1-room_2, room_1-room_3, room_2-room_4, room_3-room_4.
3. There are boxes and balls of different colors in the rooms.

My initial state:
- I am in room_4.
- grey_box_1 is in room_1.
- yellow_box_1 is in room_2.
- blue_box_1, purple_box_1, blue_box_2, and purple_ball_1 are in room_3.
- grey_ball_1 and grey_box_2 are in room_4.
- All doors (grey_door_1, yellow_door_1, green_door_1, grey_door_2) are locked.
- I'm not holding any object.
- I've visited room_4.

My goal is to make sure:
- There is a door d such that:
  - d is green (which would be green_door_1)
  - room_4 and room_2 are connected via d (which is true for green_door_1)
  - I am in front of d
  - d is not locked

In addition, I have these constraints:
1. At some point, "green_door_1 is not locked" must be true.
2. Before green_door_1 is unlocked, yellow_box_1 must be moved to room_4.

Let's think about the plan. I need to:
1. Unlock green_door_1 (which connects room_2 and room_4).
2. Go in front of green_door_1 in room_4.

But I also need to make sure that before I unlock green_door_1, yellow_box_1 is in room_4. So the general outline is:
1. Move from room_4 to room_2 (to pick up yellow_box_1).
2. Bring yellow_box_1 back to room_4.
3. Unlock green_door_1.
4. Position myself in front of green_door_1 in room_4.

Let's think about the sequence of actions:

First, I need to go from room_4 to room_2. The rooms are connected via green_door_1, but it's locked. All doors are locked, so I need to unlock some doors to move around.

Let's map the doors:
- grey_door_1 connects room_1 and room_2.
- yellow_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3.
- green_door_1 connects room_2 and room_4.
- grey_door_2 connects room_3 and room_4.

To go from room_4 to room_2, I can either:
a) Use grey_door_2 to go to room_3, then use yellow_door_1 to go to room_1, and finally use grey_door_1 to go to room_2.
b) Directly use green_door_1 to go to room_2 (but it's locked).

Let's go with option a:

1. Go to grey_door_2 in room_4.
2. Unlock (toggle) grey_door_2.
3. Go to room_3 using grey_door_2.
4. Go to yellow_door_1 in room_3.
5. Unlock (toggle) yellow_door_1.
6. Go to room_1 using yellow_door_1.
7. Go to grey_door_1 in room_1.
8. Unlock (toggle) grey_door_1.
9. Go to room_2 using grey_door_1.
10. Go to yellow_box_1 in room_2.
11. Pick up yellow_box_1.
12. Go to grey_door_1 in room_2.
13. Go to room_1 using grey_door_1.
14. Go to yellow_door_1 in room_1.
15. Go to room_3 using yellow_door_1.
16. Go to grey_door_2 in room_3.
17. Go to room_4 using grey_door_2.
18. Go to an empty position in room_4.
19. Drop yellow_box_1.
20. Now yellow_box_1 is in room_4, fulfilling the constraint.
21. Go to green_door_1 in room_4.
22. Unlock (toggle) green_door_1.
23. Now green_door_1 is unlocked, and I'm in front of it in room_4, which is the goal.

Wait, let me check if this matches the goal: "There is a door d such that 'The following conditions are all true: "d is green", "room_4 and room_2 are connected via d", "you are in front of d", "d is not locked.'"

- d = green_door_1, which is green.
- green_door_1 connects room_4 and room_2.
- After step 22, I'm in front of green_door_1 in room_4.
- After step 23, green_door_1 is unlocked.

So, the goal is satisfied. Also, the constraints are satisfied:
- green_door_1 is unlocked at some point.
- Before green_door_1 is unlocked, yellow_box_1 is in room_4.

Let's formalize this plan according to the requested format:
- "gotoobject x r": Go in front of to object x in room r.
- "gotoempty": Go in front of an empty position of the room, which does not contain any object.
- "gotodoor d r1 r2": Go in front of door d, connecting room r1 to room r2.
- "gotoroom r1 r2 d": Go to room r2 from room r1 using door d.
- "pick x r": Pick up object x in room r.
- "drop x r": Drop object x in room r.
- "toggle d": Unlock door d if is locked. Lock door d if is unlocked.

Actually, let me double-check the sequence above, as there's a issue. If the doors are locked, I can't go through them. So, I need to unlock doors.

Let me redo the sequence:

1. I start in room_4, and all doors are locked.
2. I need to go to grey_door_2 and unlock it to go to room_3.
3. Then I need to go to yellow_door_1 in room_3 and unlock it to go to room_1.
4. Then I need to go to grey_door_1 in room_1 and unlock it to go to room_2.
5. Then I can get yellow_box_1 from room_2 and bring it back to room_4.
6. Only then can I unlock green_door_1.

But wait, I can only toggle a door if I'm in front of it. And I can only go through a door if it's unlocked.

So, the sequence should be:

1. I start in room_4.
2. Go to grey_door_2 in room_4.
3. Unlock (toggle) grey_door_2.
4. Go to room_3 using grey_door_2.
5. Go to yellow_door_1 in room_3.
6. Unlock (toggle) yellow_door_1.
7. Go to room_1 using yellow_door_1.
8. Go to grey_door_1 in room_1.
9. Unlock (toggle) grey_door_1.
10. Go to room_2 using grey_door_1.
11. Go to yellow_box_1 in room_2.
12. Pick up yellow_box_1.
13. Go to grey_door_1 in room_2.
14. Go to room_1 using grey_door_1.
15. Go to yellow_door_1 in room_1.
16. Go to room_3 using yellow_door_1.
17. Go to grey_door_2 in room_3.
18. Go to room_4 using grey_door_2.
19. Go to an empty position in room_4.
20. Drop yellow_box_1.
21. Go to green_door_1 in room_4.
22. Unlock (toggle) green_door_1.

This seems correct.

Now, let's formalize the plan:

1. gotodoor grey_door_2 room_4 room_3
2. toggle grey_door_2
3. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_2
4. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1
5. toggle yellow_door_1
6. gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_1
7. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2
8. toggle grey_door_1
9. gotoroom room_1 room_2 grey_door_1
10. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_2
11. pick yellow_box_1 room_2
12. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_1
13. gotoroom room_2 room_1 grey_door_1
14. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3
15. gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1
16. gotodoor grey_door_2 room_3 room_4
17. gotoroom room_3 room_4 grey_door_2
18. gotoempty
19. drop yellow_box_1 room_4
20. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2
21. toggle green_door_1

Let me review this plan:

1. I start in room_4.
2. I go to grey_door_2 in room_4.
3. I unlock grey_door_2.
4. I go to room_3 using grey_door_2.
5. I go to yellow_door_1 in room_3.
6. I unlock yellow_door_1.
7. I go to room_1 using yellow_door_1.
8. I go to grey_door_1 in room_1.
9. I unlock grey_door_1.
10. I go to room_2 using grey_door_1.
11. I go to yellow_box_1 in room_2.
12. I pick up yellow_box_1.
13. I go to grey_door_1 in room_2.
14. I go to room_1 using grey_door_1.
15. I go to yellow_door_1 in room_1.
16. I go to room_3 using yellow_door_1.
17. I go to grey_door_2 in room_3.
18. I go to room_4 using grey_door_2.
19. I go to an empty position in room_4.
20. I drop yellow_box_1.
21. I go to green_door_1 in room_4.
22. I unlock green_door_1.

This plan ensures that yellow_box_1 is in room_4 before green_door_1 is unlocked, and the goal of being in front of an unlocked green_door_1 is achieved. I believe this plan satisfies all the requirements.

Let me add just a bit more detail to make sure the plan is correct:

1. gotodoor grey_door_2 room_4 room_3 (I go to grey_door_2 in room_4)
2. toggle grey_door_2 (I unlock grey_door_2)
3. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_2 (I go to room_3 using grey_door_2)
4. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1 (I go to yellow_door_1 in room_3)
5. toggle yellow_door_1 (I unlock yellow_door_1)
6. gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_1 (I go to room_1 using yellow_door_1)
7. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2 (I go to grey_door_1 in room_1)
8. toggle grey_door_1 (I unlock grey_door_1)
9. gotoroom room_1 room_2 grey_door_1 (I go to room_2 using grey_door_1)
10. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_2 (I go to yellow_box_1 in room_2)
11. pick yellow_box_1 room_2 (I pick up yellow_box_1)
12. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_1 (I go to grey_door_1 in room_2)
13. gotoroom room_2 room_1 grey_door_1 (I go to room_1 using grey_door_1)
14. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3 (I go to yellow_door_1 in room_1)
15. gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1 (I go to room_3 using yellow_door_1)
16. gotodoor grey_door_2 room_3 room_4 (I go to grey_door_2 in room_3)
17. gotoroom room_3 room_4 grey_door_2 (I go to room_4 using grey_door_2)
18. gotoempty (I go to an empty position in room_4)
19. drop yellow_box_1 room_4 (I drop yellow_box_1 in room_4)
20. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2 (I go to green_door_1 in room_4)
21. toggle green_door_1 (I unlock green_door_1)

Hmm, I'm still making sure the plan is correct. When I use gotoroom, I need to make sure the door I'm using is mentioned in the parameters. Let me double-check:

Here are the doors again:
- grey_door_1 connects room_1 and room_2.
- yellow_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3.
- green_door_1 connects room_2 and room_4.
- grey_door_2 connects room_3 and room_4.

Let's revise the plan:

1. I start in room_4. 
   - grey_door_2 connects room_3 and room_4. 
   - green_door_1 connects room_2 and room_4.
2. To go to another room, I'd need to use one of these doors, and both are locked. Let's first go to grey_door_2 and unlock it.
   - action: "gotodoor grey_door_2 room_4 room_3" (Go to grey_door_2, which connects room_4 and room_3)
3. Unlock grey_door_2.
   - action: "toggle grey_door_2"
4. Go to room_3 using grey_door_2.
   - action: "gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_2"
5. In room_3, I have access to yellow_door_1 which connects to room_1. I need to unlock it.
   - action: "gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1" (Go to yellow_door_1, which connects room_3 and room_1)
6. Unlock yellow_door_1.
   - action: "toggle yellow_door_1"
7. Go to room_1 using yellow_door_1.
   - action: "gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_1"
8. In room_1, I have access to grey_door_1 which connects to room_2. I need to unlock it.
   - action: "gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2" (Go to grey_door_1, which connects room_1 and room_2)
9. Unlock grey_door_1.
   - action: "toggle grey_door_1"
10. Go to room_2 using grey_door_1.
    - action: "gotoroom room_1 room_2 grey_door_1"
11. In room_2, I need to pick up yellow_box_1.
    - action: "gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_2"
12. Pick up yellow_box_1.
    - action: "pick yellow_box_1 room_2"
13. Now, I need to bring yellow_box_1 back to room_4. I can use the same path I used to get here.
    - action: "gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_1" (Go to grey_door_1, which connects room_2 and room_1)
14. Go to room_1 using grey_door_1.
    - action: "gotoroom room_2 room_1 grey_door_1"
15. In room_1, go to yellow_door_1.
    - action: "gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3" (Go to yellow_door_1, which connects room_1 and room_3)
16. Go to room_3 using yellow_door_1.
    - action: "gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1"
17. In room_3, go to grey_door_2.
    - action: "gotodoor grey_door_2 room_3 room_4" (Go to grey_door_2, which connects room_3 and room_4)
18. Go to room_4 using grey_door_2.
    - action: "gotoroom room_3 room_4 grey_door_2"
19. In room_4, I need to drop yellow_box_1. First, go to an empty position.
    - action: "gotoempty"
20. Drop yellow_box_1.
    - action: "drop yellow_box_1 room_4"
21. Now, I need to unlock green_door_1. Go to green_door_1.
    - action: "gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2" (Go to green_door_1, which connects room_4 and room_2)
22. Unlock green_door_1.
    - action: "toggle green_door_1"

Alright, I believe this plan satisfies all the requirements:
- The goal is achieved: I'm in front of green_door_1, which is unlocked.
- Constraint 1 is satisfied: green_door_1 is unlocked at the end.
- Constraint 2 is satisfied: yellow_box_1 is in room_4 before green_door_1 is unlocked.

Let me check if there are any other potential issues or nuances I might have missed:

1. I start in room_4.
2. I go to and unlock grey_door_2.
3. I go to room_3.
4. I go to and unlock yellow_door_1.
5. I go to room_1.
6. I go to and unlock grey_door_1.
7. I go to room_2.
8. I pick up yellow_box_1.
9. I bring it back to room_4 via room_1 and room_3.
10. I drop yellow_box_1 in room_4.
11. I go to and unlock green_door_1.

This fulfills all the necessary steps and constraints.

Actually, let's make sure the plan satisfies the preconditions for each action:

1. "gotodoor grey_door_2 room_4 room_3": I can do this because I'm in room_4, and grey_door_2 connects room_4 to room_3. I'm assuming there's no object blocking the door in room_4.
2. "toggle grey_door_2": I can do this because I'm in front of grey_door_2 after the previous action.
3. "gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_2": I can do this because I'm in room_4, grey_door_2 connects room_4 to room_3, and grey_door_2 is unlocked after the previous action.
4. "gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1": I can do this because I'm in room_3, and yellow_door_1 connects room_3 to room_1. I'm assuming there's no object blocking the door in room_3.
5. "toggle yellow_door_1": I can do this because I'm in front of yellow_door_1 after the previous action.
6. "gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_1": I can do this because I'm in room_3, yellow_door_1 connects room_3 to room_1, and yellow_door_1 is unlocked after the previous action.
7. "gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2": I can do this because I'm in room_1, and grey_door_1 connects room_1 to room_2. I'm assuming there's no object blocking the door in room_1.
8. "toggle grey_door_1": I can do this because I'm in front of grey_door_1 after the previous action.
9. "gotoroom room_1 room_2 grey_door_1": I can do this because I'm in room_1, grey_door_1 connects room_1 to room_2, and grey_door_1 is unlocked after the previous action.
10. "gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_2": I can do this because I'm in room_2, and yellow_box_1 is in room_2.
11. "pick yellow_box_1 room_2": I can do this because I'm in front of yellow_box_1 in room_2, and my hands are empty.
12. "gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_1": I can do this because I'm in room_2, and grey_door_1 connects room_2 to room_1. Even though I'm carrying yellow_box_1, I can still go to the door because the action doesn't check if I'm holding anything.
13. "gotoroom room_2 room_1 grey_door_1": I can do this because I'm in room_2, grey_door_1 connects room_2 to room_1, and grey_door_1 is unlocked.
14. "gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3": I can do this because I'm in room_1, and yellow_door_1 connects room_1 to room_3.
15. "gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1": I can do this because I'm in room_1, yellow_door_1 connects room_1 to room_3, and yellow_door_1 is unlocked.
16. "gotodoor grey_door_2 room_3 room_4": I can do this because I'm in room_3, and grey_door_2 connects room_3 to room_4.
17. "gotoroom room_3 room_4 grey_door_2": I can do this because I'm in room_3, grey_door_2 connects room_3 to room_4, and grey_door_2 is unlocked.
18. "gotoempty": I can do this anytime.
19. "drop yellow_box_1 room_4": I can do this because I'm in room_4, I'm holding yellow_box_1, and I'm in front of an empty position.
20. "gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2": I can do this because I'm in room_4, and green_door_1 connects room_4 to room_2. I'm assuming there's no object blocking the door in room_4.
21. "toggle green_door_1": I can do this because I'm in front of green_door_1 after the previous action.

All the preconditions seem to be satisfied for each action. Now let's double-check the effects to ensure the plan is consistent:

1. After "gotodoor grey_door_2 room_4 room_3", I'm in front of grey_door_2 in room_4.
2. After "toggle grey_door_2", grey_door_2 is unlocked.
3. After "gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_2", I'm in room_3 and no longer in front of grey_door_2.
4. After "gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1", I'm in front of yellow_door_1 in room_3.
5. After "toggle yellow_door_1", yellow_door_1 is unlocked.
6. After "gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_1", I'm in room_1 and no longer in front of yellow_door_1.
7. After "gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2", I'm in front of grey_door_1 in room_1.
8. After "toggle grey_door_1", grey_door_1 is unlocked.
9. After "gotoroom room_1 room_2 grey_door_1", I'm in room_2 and no longer in front of grey_door_1.
10. After "gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_2", I'm in front of yellow_box_1 in room_2.
11. After "pick yellow_box_1 room_2", I'm holding yellow_box_1, and it's no longer in room_2.
12. After "gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_1", I'm in front of grey_door_1 in room_2.
13. After "gotoroom room_2 room_1 grey_door_1", I'm in room_1 and no longer in front of grey_door_1.
14. After "gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3", I'm in front of yellow_door_1 in room_1.
15. After "gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1", I'm in room_3 and no longer in front of yellow_door_1.
16. After "gotodoor grey_door_2 room_3 room_4", I'm in front of grey_door_2 in room_3.
17. After "gotoroom room_3 room_4 grey_door_2", I'm in room_4 and no longer in front of grey_door_2.
18. After "gotoempty", I'm in front of an empty position in room_4.
19. After "drop yellow_box_1 room_4", yellow_box_1 is in room_4, and I'm no longer holding it.
20. After "gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2", I'm in front of green_door_1 in room_4.
21. After "toggle green_door_1", green_door_1 is unlocked.

The effects are also consistent with the actions. I believe this plan is valid.

Let's also check the constraints one more time:
1. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'green_door_1 is not locked'": This is true after the 21st action, "toggle green_door_1", where green_door_1 is unlocked.
2. "If expression 'green_door_1 is not locked' holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: 'yellow_box_1 is in room_4'": This is also true. After the 19th action, "drop yellow_box_1 room_4", yellow_box_1 is in room_4. This is before the 21st action, where green_door_1 is unlocked.

Both constraints are satisfied.

And the goal: "There is a door d such that 'The following conditions are all true: "d is green", "room_4 and room_2 are connected via d", "you are in front of d", "d is not locked'"" 

After the 21st action, I'm in front of green_door_1 in room_4, and green_door_1 is unlocked. green_door_1 is green (from the given information), and it connects room_4 and room_2. So, the goal is satisfied.

So my final plan is:

1. gotodoor grey_door_2 room_4 room_3
2. toggle grey_door_2
3. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_2
4. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1
5. toggle yellow_door_1
6. gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_1
7. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2
8. toggle grey_door_1
9. gotoroom room_1 room_2 grey_door_1
10. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_2
11. pick yellow_box_1 room_2
12. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_1
13. gotoroom room_2 room_1 grey_door_1
14. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3
15. gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1
16. gotodoor grey_door_2 room_3 room_4
17. gotoroom room_3 room_4 grey_door_2
18. gotoempty
19. drop yellow_box_1 room_4
20. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2
21. toggle green_door_1

I'm confident this plan is correct and satisfies all the requirements.
