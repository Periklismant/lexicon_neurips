Let's break down the problem:

We're navigating a 2D gridworld with 4 rooms arranged in a square. The rooms are:
- room_1: north-west
- room_2: south-west
- room_3: north-east
- room_4: south-east

There are 4 doors connecting the rooms:
- yellow_door_1: connects room_1 and room_2
- grey_door_1: connects room_1 and room_3
- green_door_1: connects room_2 and room_4
- yellow_door_2: connects room_3 and room_4

We have various boxes and balls in the rooms with different colors.

Initial state:
- We're in room_3
- purple_ball_1 is in room_1
- yellow_ball_1 is in room_2
- blue_box_1 is in room_3
- blue_ball_1 is in room_3
- yellow_box_1 is in room_3
- green_box_1 is in room_4
- blue_box_2 is in room_4
- red_box_1 is in room_4
- All doors are locked (yellow_door_1, grey_door_1, green_door_1, yellow_door_2)
- We're not holding any object

Goal:
- We need to be in front of an unlocked green door.

Constraints:
1. At some point, yellow_door_2 must be locked.
2. If yellow_door_2 is locked in some state, then either yellow_door_1 is unlocked or blue_box_1 is in room_2 at that state or at a future state.

The green door in our world is green_door_1, which connects room_2 and room_4.

Let's plan:
1. yellow_door_2 is already locked initially, so constraint 1 is satisfied.
2. Since yellow_door_2 is locked, we need to either unlock yellow_door_1 or move blue_box_1 to room_2 according to constraint 2.
3. To be in front of the green door (green_door_1), we need to be in either room_2 or room_4. We're currently in room_3.
4. We need to unlock the green door before it becomes our goal.

First, let's analyze the shortest path to get to green_door_1:
- From room_3, we can go to room_1 via grey_door_1 (after unlocking it).
- From room_1, we can go to room_2 via yellow_door_1 (after unlocking it).
- From room_2, we can get to green_door_1.

Alternatively:
- From room_3, we can go to room_4 via yellow_door_2 (after unlocking it).
- From room_4, we can get to green_door_1.

For the second constraint, one option is to unlock yellow_door_1. The other option is to move blue_box_1 from room_3 to room_2. 

If we go from room_3 to room_1 to room_2, we'd need to unlock both grey_door_1 and yellow_door_1. Then, since yellow_door_1 is unlocked, constraint 2 is satisfied.

Let's work with this path. We'll aim to:
1. Unlock grey_door_1
2. Go from room_3 to room_1
3. Unlock yellow_door_1
4. Go from room_1 to room_2
5. Go to green_door_1
6. Unlock green_door_1
7. Check if we're in front of it.

Let's detail the plan:

1. Go to grey_door_1 in room_3
2. Unlock grey_door_1
3. Go from room_3 to room_1 using grey_door_1
4. Go to yellow_door_1 in room_1
5. Unlock yellow_door_1
6. Go from room_1 to room_2 using yellow_door_1
7. Go to green_door_1 in room_2
8. Unlock green_door_1
9. We're now in front of an unlocked green door (goal achieved)

Let's convert this to actions:

1. `gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1`
2. `toggle grey_door_1`
3. `gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1`
4. `gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2`
5. `toggle yellow_door_1`
6. `gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1`
7. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4`
8. `toggle green_door_1`

This should satisfy both constraints and achieve the goal.

But wait, I need to think about if this actually works with the action definitions. Let's double-check.

Action `gotodoor d r1 r2`: This works for steps 1, 4, and 7 as we're going in front of a door that connects two rooms.

Action `toggle d`: This works for steps 2, 5, and 8 as we're toggling a door we're in front of.

Action `gotoroom r1 r2 d`: This works for steps 3 and 6 as we're moving from one room to another through a door.

One more thing to check: do doors get blocked by objects? I don't see any explicit mention of this in the effects. But I do see in the preconditions for `goto door` that there should be no object blocking the door. Let's just ensure our plan doesn't lead to any blocked doors.

Actually, I think I'm missing a bit of context here. Are doors initially blocked by any objects? Let's re-check the initial state of the objects.

It doesn't explicitly say that any door is blocked by an object in the initial state, so I'll assume they're not.

Also, after re-checking, I realize we need to ensure that after yellow_door_2 is locked, either yellow_door_1 is unlocked or blue_box_1 is in room_2. In our initial plan, we're unlocking yellow_door_1, so constraint 2 is satisfied.

Let's double-check the plan once more to make sure it meets all the requirements.

We start in room_3. yellow_door_2 is already locked, which satisfies constraint 1. We'll unlock yellow_door_1 later in our plan, which will satisfy constraint 2. The goal is to be in front of an unlocked green door, which we'll achieve by going to green_door_1 and unlocking it.

I believe the plan I outlined earlier is correct. Here's the detailed sequence of actions:

1. `gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1`
2. `toggle grey_door_1`
3. `gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1`
4. `gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2`
5. `toggle yellow_door_1`
6. `gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1`
7. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4`
8. `toggle green_door_1`

Wait, let me reconsider again.

We start in room_3. yellow_door_2 is already locked initially. According to constraint 2, after yellow_door_2 is locked, we need to either unlock yellow_door_1 or move blue_box_1 to room_2. In our plan, we'll unlock yellow_door_1, which will satisfy constraint 2.

However, let's think through this step by step to ensure I'm not missing anything.

1. We're in room_3. All doors are locked, including yellow_door_2. (Constraint 1 is satisfied)
2. We need to go to grey_door_1 to unlock it and enter room_1, then go to yellow_door_1 to unlock it and enter room_2, then go to green_door_1 to unlock it and achieve our goal.

But there's another way to achieve the goal:
1. We're in room_3. All doors are locked, including yellow_door_2. (Constraint 1 is satisfied)
2. We could unlock yellow_door_2, go to room_4, then go to green_door_1 to unlock it and achieve our goal.

Both plans would satisfy constraint 2 as long as we unlock yellow_door_1 at some point, which is what we plan to do in the first approach. But the second approach seems shorter. Let's redo our plan using this approach:

1. Go to yellow_door_2 in room_3
2. Unlock yellow_door_2 (Now, constraint 2 requires us to either unlock yellow_door_1 or move blue_box_1 to room_2)
3. Go from room_3 to room_4 using yellow_door_2
4. Go to green_door_1 in room_4
5. Unlock green_door_1
6. We're now in front of an unlocked green door (goal achieved)

But with this plan, we haven't fulfilled constraint 2 yet. We need to either unlock yellow_door_1 or move blue_box_1 to room_2.

To unlock yellow_door_1:
7. Go from room_4 to room_2 using green_door_1
8. Go to yellow_door_1 in room_2
9. Unlock yellow_door_1

Alternatively, to move blue_box_1 to room_2:
7. Go from room_4 to room_3 using yellow_door_2
8. Go to blue_box_1 in room_3
9. Pick up blue_box_1
10. Go to yellow_door_2 in room_3
11. Go from room_3 to room_4 using yellow_door_2
12. Go to green_door_1 in room_4
13. Go from room_4 to room_2 using green_door_1
14. Go to an empty position in room_2
15. Drop blue_box_1

The second approach seems longer. Let's go with the first one.

So our revised plan:
1. `gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_3 room_4`
2. `toggle yellow_door_2`
3. `gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_2`
4. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2`
5. `toggle green_door_1`
6. `gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_1`
7. `gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_1`
8. `toggle yellow_door_1`

Hmm, wait, I just realized I misunderstood the goal. We don't need to go through the green door; we just need to be in front of it after unlocking it. So let's simplify our revised plan:

1. `gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_3 room_4`
2. `toggle yellow_door_2`
3. `gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_2`
4. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2`
5. `toggle green_door_1` (Goal achieved: We're in front of an unlocked green door)
6. `gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_1`
7. `gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_1`
8. `toggle yellow_door_1` (Constraint 2 satisfied: yellow_door_1 is unlocked)

But this is longer than our first approach. Let's review our original plan:

1. `gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1`
2. `toggle grey_door_1`
3. `gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1`
4. `gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2`
5. `toggle yellow_door_1` (Constraint 2 satisfied: yellow_door_1 is unlocked)
6. `gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1`
7. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4`
8. `toggle green_door_1` (Goal achieved: We're in front of an unlocked green door)

This original approach seems optimal, so let's go with it.

Actually, let me think once more about the constraints to make sure I understand them correctly:

1. "yellow_door_2 is locked" must hold in at least one state. This is true initially, so this constraint is automatically satisfied.

2. If "yellow_door_2 is locked" holds in some state s, then in that state s or any future state, either "yellow_door_1 is not locked" or "blue_box_1 is in room_2" must be true.

So, as long as at some point after the start of our plan (or at the start), yellow_door_1 is unlocked or blue_box_1 is in room_2, we're good. In our plan, we do unlock yellow_door_1, so constraint 2 is satisfied.

I've been too verbose, but let's stick with the first plan:

1. `gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1`
2. `toggle grey_door_1`
3. `gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1`
4. `gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2`
5. `toggle yellow_door_1`
6. `gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1`
7. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4`
8. `toggle green_door_1`

This plan unlocks yellow_door_1 at step 5, satisfying constraint 2, and achieves the goal of being in front of an unlocked green door at step 8.

But wait, there's a possible variation to consider:

1. We could move blue_box_1 from room_3 to room_2, satisfying constraint 2 in a different way.
2. Then we go to room_4 via yellow_door_2, then to green_door_1, unlock it, and we're done.

Let's see if this approach could be shorter:

1. `gotoobject blue_box_1 room_3`
2. `pick blue_box_1 room_3`
3. `gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1`
4. `toggle grey_door_1`
5. `gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1`
6. `gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2`
7. `toggle yellow_door_1`
8. `gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1`
9. `gotoempty`
10. `drop blue_box_1 room_2` (Constraint 2 satisfied: blue_box_1 is in room_2)
11. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4`
12. `toggle green_door_1` (Goal achieved: We're in front of an unlocked green door)

This approach is longer. Let's stick with the first plan.

Alright, let's summarize:

1. `gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1`
2. `toggle grey_door_1`
3. `gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1`
4. `gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2`
5. `toggle yellow_door_1`
6. `gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1`
7. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4`
8. `toggle green_door_1`

This plan:
- Satisfies constraint 1: yellow_door_2 is locked at the beginning.
- Satisfies constraint 2: yellow_door_1 is unlocked after step 5.
- Achieves the goal: We're in front of an unlocked green door after step 8.

Hmm, actually, I'm overthinking this. Let's look at it one more time:

Constraint 1: At some point, yellow_door_2 must be locked. -> It's locked at the beginning, so this is satisfied.
Constraint 2: If yellow_door_2 is locked in some state, then either yellow_door_1 is unlocked or blue_box_1 is in room_2 at that state or at a future state. -> yellow_door_2 is locked at the beginning, so we either need to unlock yellow_door_1 or move blue_box_1 to room_2.
Goal: We need to be in front of an unlocked green door.

Now, let's think of the shortest path to achieve this:

From room_3, we have two options:
1. Go to room_1 via grey_door_1, then to room_2 via yellow_door_1, then to green_door_1.
2. Go to room_4 via yellow_door_2, then to green_door_1.

The second option seems shorter. But we still need to satisfy constraint 2. We could either:
A. Unlock yellow_door_1, which requires going to it.
B. Move blue_box_1 to room_2.

Option 2A would be:
1. `gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_3 room_4`
2. `toggle yellow_door_2`
3. `gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_2`
4. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2`
5. `toggle green_door_1` (Goal achieved: We're in front of an unlocked green door)
6. `gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_1`
7. `gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_1`
8. `toggle yellow_door_1` (Constraint 2 satisfied: yellow_door_1 is unlocked)

Wait, this doesn't make sense. If yellow_door_2 is no longer locked after step 2, then constraint 2 doesn't need to be satisfied. Let me re-read the constraint.

"If expression 'yellow_door_2 is locked' holds in some state s, then expression 'At least one of the following conditions is true: "yellow_door_1 is not locked", "blue_box_1 is in room_2"' must hold at s or at some state after s."

So, once yellow_door_2 is unlocked, the condition for constraint 2 is no longer met, so we don't need to worry about satisfying it.

Let's go with the simpler plan:
1. `gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_3 room_4`
2. `toggle yellow_door_2`
3. `gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_2`
4. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2`
5. `toggle green_door_1` (Goal achieved: We're in front of an unlocked green door)

Actually, wait. The constraint is: If yellow_door_2 is locked in some state s, then a condition must hold at s or at a future state. yellow_door_2 is locked at the beginning, which is state s_0. So, at s_0 or at any future state, either yellow_door_1 must be unlocked or blue_box_1 must be in room_2.

So, even if we unlock yellow_door_2, the constraint still needs to be satisfied for the future states.

Let's try a different approach:

1. `gotoobject blue_box_1 room_3` (Going to blue_box_1 in room_3)
2. `pick blue_box_1 room_3` (Picking up blue_box_1)
3. `gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_3 room_4` (Going to yellow_door_2)
4. `toggle yellow_door_2` (Unlocking yellow_door_2)
5. `gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_2` (Going to room_4)
6. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2` (Going to green_door_1)
7. `toggle green_door_1` (Goal achieved: We're in front of an unlocked green door)
8. `gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_1` (Going to room_2)
9. `gotoempty` (Going to an empty position in room_2)
10. `drop blue_box_1 room_2` (Constraint 2 satisfied: blue_box_1 is in room_2)

Actually, this too complicated. Let's step by step:

First, the goal is to ensure there is a door d such that d is green, d is unlocked, and we're in front of d. The only green door in our world is green_door_1, which connects room_2 and room_4.

Second, we need to ensure that yellow_door_2 is locked in at least one state. It's already locked at the beginning, so this constraint is automatically satisfied.

Third, we need to ensure that if yellow_door_2 is locked in state s, then either yellow_door_1 is unlocked or blue_box_1 is in room_2 at state s or any future state. At the beginning, yellow_door_2 is locked, so we need to ensure that in our plan, at some point, either yellow_door_1 is unlocked or blue_box_1 is moved to room_2.

We're initially in room_3. The shortest path to green_door_1 is:
1. Go to yellow_door_2 in room_3
2. Unlock yellow_door_2
3. Go from room_3 to room_4 using yellow_door_2
4. Go to green_door_1 in room_4
5. Unlock green_door_1 (Goal achieved)

But now we have to satisfy the constraint. Either:
6A. Go from room_4 to room_2 using green_door_1
7A. Go to yellow_door_1 in room_2
8A. Unlock yellow_door_1

Or:
6B. Go back to room_3 using yellow_door_2
7B. Go to blue_box_1 in room_3
8B. Pick up blue_box_1
9B. Go to yellow_door_2 in room_3
10B. Go from room_3 to room_4 using yellow_door_2
11B. Go to green_door_1 in room_4
12B. Go from room_4 to room_2 using green_door_1
13B. Go to an empty position in room_2
14B. Drop blue_box_1

The first option (6A-8A) seems shorter. Let's consolidate our plan:

1. `gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_3 room_4`
2. `toggle yellow_door_2`
3. `gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_2`
4. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2`
5. `toggle green_door_1` (Goal achieved: We're in front of an unlocked green door)
6. `gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_1`
7. `gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_1`
8. `toggle yellow_door_1` (Constraint 2 satisfied: yellow_door_1 is unlocked)

But wait, we don't need to do steps 6-8 because after we've unlocked green_door_1, we've achieved the goal. The constraint only states that if yellow_door_2 is locked, then yellow_door_1 is unlocked or blue_box_1 is in room_2. After step 2, yellow_door_2 is no longer locked, so the constraint is moot.

Let's think this through differently:

Let's denote the states as s_0, s_1, ..., s_n, where s_0 is the initial state and s_n is the final state.

At s_0, yellow_door_2 is locked. According to constraint 2, there should be a state s_i (where i >= 0) in which either yellow_door_1 is unlocked or blue_box_1 is in room_2.

If we go with only steps 1-5 of our consolidated plan, yellow_door_1 will remain locked throughout all states (s_0 to s_5) and blue_box_1 will remain in room_3. That would mean constraint 2 is not satisfied.

So, we do need steps 6-8.

Let me double check if I'm understanding the constraints correctly.

Constraint 1: "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'yellow_door_2 is locked'".
This means in at least one of the states in our plan, yellow_door_2 should be locked. This is already true for the initial state, so the constraint is satisfied.

Constraint 2: "If expression 'yellow_door_2 is locked' holds in some state s, then expression 'At least one of the following conditions is true: "yellow_door_1 is not locked", "blue_box_1 is in room_2"' must hold at s or at some state after s."
This means that for every state s in which yellow_door_2 is locked, either yellow_door_1 is unlocked or blue_box_1 is in room_2 in that same state s or a later state. In the initial state, yellow_door_2 is locked, but neither yellow_door_1 is unlocked nor blue_box_1 is in room_2. So, in our plan, at some point, we have to ensure either yellow_door_1 is unlocked or blue_box_1 is moved to room_2.

So, we do need to ensure constraint 2 is satisfied. Let's stick with our consolidated plan:

1. `gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_3 room_4`
2. `toggle yellow_door_2`
3. `gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_2`
4. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2`
5. `toggle green_door_1` (Goal achieved: We're in front of an unlocked green door)
6. `gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_1`
7. `gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_1`
8. `toggle yellow_door_1` (Constraint 2 satisfied: yellow_door_1 is unlocked)

But there's a problem here. When we go into a new room using `gotoroom`, we move away from being in front of a door. If we execute step 6, we're no longer in front of green_door_1, which means we no longer have achieved the goal.

It seems like I need to satisfy constraint 2 before achieving the goal, or find a way to meet both simultaneously.

Let's redo our plan:

1. `gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_3 room_4` (Going to yellow_door_2 in room_3)
2. `toggle yellow_door_2` (Unlocking yellow_door_2)
3. `gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_2` (Going to room_4)
4. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2` (Going to green_door_1 in room_4)
5. `gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_1` (Going to room_2)
6. `gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_1` (Going to yellow_door_1 in room_2)
7. `toggle yellow_door_1` (Unlocking yellow_door_1, Constraint 2 satisfied)
8. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4` (Going back to green_door_1 in room_2)
9. `toggle green_door_1` (Unlocking green_door_1, Goal achieved)

Wait, the goal also includes "d is not locked". So we don't just need to be in front of green_door_1, we need to ensure it's unlocked as well. Let's redo:

1. `gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_3 room_4`
2. `toggle yellow_door_2`
3. `gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_2`
4. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2`
5. `gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_1`
6. `gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_1`
7. `toggle yellow_door_1` (Constraint 2 satisfied: yellow_door_1 is unlocked)
8. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4`
9. `toggle green_door_1` (Unlocking green_door_1)

Hmm, I think I'm confusing myself. Let me check something. When I do `gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_1`, am I already in front of green_door_1 in room_2? I think not. According to the effects of the action, if I was in front of a door, I'm no longer in front of it.

So, let's replan:

1. `gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_3 room_4`
2. `toggle yellow_door_2`
3. `gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_2`
4. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2`
5. `toggle green_door_1` (Unlocking green_door_1)
   At this point, the door is unlocked, but we're still on the room_4 side.
6. `gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_1`
7. `gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_1`
8. `toggle yellow_door_1` (Constraint 2 satisfied: yellow_door_1 is unlocked)
9. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4`
   Now, we're in front of green_door_1 on the room_2 side and the door is unlocked. Goal achieved.

Alternatively, we could also solve it as follows:

1. `gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1`
2. `toggle grey_door_1`
3. `gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1`
4. `gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2`
5. `toggle yellow_door_1` (Constraint 2 satisfied: yellow_door_1 is unlocked)
6. `gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1`
7. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4`
8. `toggle green_door_1` (Unlocking green_door_1)
   Goal achieved: We're in front of an unlocked green door.

This plan also works and actually has the same number of steps (8) as our last version.

Let's ensure we're actually in front of the unlocked green door at the end. When we `toggle green_door_1`, we're still in front of the green door, right? Since toggling a door doesn't change our position, I believe this is the case. So after step 8, we are in front of an unlocked green door.

I already know that yellow_door_2 is locked at the beginning, which satisfies constraint 1.

At the beginning, yellow_door_2 is locked, but neither yellow_door_1 is unlocked nor blue_box_1 is in room_2. In our plan, we unlock yellow_door_1 at step 5, which satisfies constraint 2.

However, there's one more thing to check: when we `gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1`, are we still in front of yellow_door_1? I don't think so, according to the effects of the `gotoroom` action: "if you were in front of some object or door x0, then you are no longer in front of x0."

So, in step 6, we are no longer in front of yellow_door_1. This means after step 6, both yellow_door_2 and yellow_door_1 are unlocked. If by chance, the door can be locked again, then we could loop back and lock yellow_door_2 to force constraint 1 to be true. But constraint 1 is already satisfied because yellow_door_2 is locked at the beginning.

So I think we're good with this plan:
1. `gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1`
2. `toggle grey_door_1`
3. `gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1`
4. `gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2`
5. `toggle yellow_door_1` (Constraint 2 satisfied: yellow_door_1 is unlocked)
6. `gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1`
7. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4`
8. `toggle green_door_1` (Unlocking green_door_1)
   Goal achieved: We're in front of an unlocked green door.

Let's check the steps to make sure our plan is valid:

1. `gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1` valid because we are in room_3.
2. `toggle grey_door_1` valid because we are in front of grey_door_1 (from step 1).
3. `gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1` valid because we are in room_3, and grey_door_1 is unlocked.
4. `gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2` valid because we are in room_1.
5. `toggle yellow_door_1` valid because we are in front of yellow_door_1 (from step 4).
6. `gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1` valid because we are in room_1, and yellow_door_1 is unlocked.
7. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4` valid because we are in room_2, and there's no mention of a barrier.
8. `toggle green_door_1` valid because we are in front of green_door_1 (from step 7).

All steps are valid! The goal is achieved, and the constraints are met.

Let me now try to find another solution that is shorter.

Starting from room_3, we need to go to green_door_1 and unlock it. The shortest path to green_door_1 seems to be via yellow_door_2 to room_4.

1. `gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_3 room_4`
2. `toggle yellow_door_2` (Unlocking yellow_door_2)
3. `gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_2`
4. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2`
5. `toggle green_door_1` (Unlocking green_door_1, Goal achieved)

But we still need to ensure constraint 2 is met. After step 2, yellow_door_2 is no longer locked. But it was locked before that, so we need to make sure that at some point, either yellow_door_1 is unlocked or blue_box_1 is in room_2.

Let's continue:
6. `gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_1`
7. `gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_1`
8. `toggle yellow_door_1` (Unlocking yellow_door_1, Constraint 2 satisfied)

But now, we're not in front of green_door_1, so the goal isn't met. We'd need to go back:
9. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4`

This gives us a 9-step plan, which is longer than our previous 8-step plan. So let's stick with the one we have.

I need to redo one more sanity check though. If the constraint states:

"If expression 'yellow_door_2 is locked' holds in some state s, then expression 'At least one of the following conditions is true: "yellow_door_1 is not locked", "blue_box_1 is in room_2"' must hold at s or at some state after s."

Then I need to be more precise. At the beginning (state s_0), yellow_door_2 is locked, but in that same state, neither yellow_door_1 is unlocked nor blue_box_1 is in room_2.

According to the constraint, we have to ensure that either yellow_door_1 is unlocked or blue_box_1 is in room_2 in s_0 or some state after s_0. In our plan, we unlock yellow_door_1 at step 5, which is state s_5. So from s_5 onwards, yellow_door_1 is unlocked, satisfying the constraint.

I think in our first solution, we have a better approach, so I'll stick with this.

To summarize our final plan:

1. `gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1`
2. `toggle grey_door_1`
3. `gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1`
4. `gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2`
5. `toggle yellow_door_1` (Constraint 2 satisfied: yellow_door_1 is unlocked)
6. `gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1`
7. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4`
8. `toggle green_door_1` (Unlocking green_door_1)
   Goal achieved: We're in front of an unlocked green door, where we are in front of green_door_1.

All constraints are met, and the goal is achieved.

I think this solution is correct. Let's go with this.

Wait, I think we could go a different route. Let's try:

1. Pick up blue_box_1 from room_3.
2. Go to yellow_door_2 in room_3.
3. Unlock yellow_door_2.
4. Go to room_4.
5. Go to green_door_1 in room_4.
6. Unlock green_door_1 (Goal achieved).
7. Go to room_2.
8. Drop blue_box_1 in room_2 (Constraint 2 satisfied).

Let's see if this works:

1. `gotoobject blue_box_1 room_3`
2. `pick blue_box_1 room_3`
3. `gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_3 room_4`
4. `toggle yellow_door_2`
5. `gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_2`
6. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2`
7. `toggle green_door_1` (Goal achieved: We're in front of an unlocked green door)

At this point, we need to ensure constraint 2 is satisfied. We need to drop blue_box_1 in room_2.

8. `gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_1`
9. `gotoempty`
10. `drop blue_box_1 room_2` (Constraint 2 satisfied: blue_box_1 is in room_2)

But after step 8, we're no longer in front of green_door_1, so we'd need to go back.

11. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4`

This plan has 11 steps, which is longer than our 8-step plan. Let's stick with the 8-step plan.

Alright, our final solution is:

1. `gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1`
2. `toggle grey_door_1`
3. `gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1`
4. `gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2`
5. `toggle yellow_door_1`
6. `gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1`
7. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4`
8. `toggle green_door_1`

With this plan:
- Constraint 1 is satisfied because yellow_door_2 is locked at the beginning.
- Constraint 2 is satisfied because yellow_door_1 is unlocked from step 5 onwards, and yellow_door_2 was locked at the beginning.
- The goal is achieved because after step 8, we're in front of an unlocked green door (green_door_1).
