Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. The goal is to end up in front of a green door that's unlocked. The constraints are a bit tricky. First, I need to make sure that at some point, yellow_door_2 is locked. Also, whenever yellow_door_2 is locked, either yellow_door_1 is unlocked or blue_box_1 is in room_2. 

Starting from room_3. The doors here are grey_door_1 (connecting to room_1) and yellow_door_2 (connecting to room_4). All doors are locked initially. The green door is green_door_1, which connects room_2 and room_4. So the green door is in room_2 or room_4. But the agent starts in room_3. 

First, maybe the agent needs to unlock the green door. But all doors are locked. So to reach the green door, the agent needs to unlock doors along the way. Let's see the possible paths.

From room_3, possible doors are grey_door_1 (to room_1) and yellow_door_2 (to room_4). Both are locked. So the agent must first toggle these doors. But to toggle a door, you need to be in front of it. So first, go to a door, toggle it, then go through.

Wait, initial state: agent is in room_3. To get to room_1, need to go through grey_door_1. But grey_door_1 is locked. So the steps would be: gotoempty (since in room_3, maybe there's a door there?), but the doors are in the room but to go to a door, you need to be in a room connected by that door. Wait, the gotodoor action requires that the current room is connected via that door. So in room_3, the doors are grey_door_1 (connecting to room_1) and yellow_door_2 (connecting to room_4). So to go to grey_door_1, the agent is in room_3, which is connected via grey_door_1 to room_1. So they can go to that door. But if there's an object blocking the position in front of the door in the current room (room_3), then they can't. The initial state in room_3 has blue_box_1, blue_ball_1, and yellow_box_1. Are any of these blocking the door positions? The problem says that objects can block door positions. So if, for example, blue_box_1 is in front of grey_door_1 in room_3, then the agent can't go to the door. But the initial state doesn't specify positions of objects relative to doors. Hmm. The problem statement doesn't mention any objects blocking doors initially, so maybe none are blocking. So the agent can go to the door.

So steps:

1. From room_3, go to grey_door_1 (gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1). Wait, the action is "gotodoor d r1 r2", but the agent is in room_3, which is connected to room_1 via grey_door_1. So the correct action is "gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1". Then toggle it to unlock. Then go through to room_1. Then from room_1, perhaps go to room_2 via yellow_door_1, but that's locked. So need to unlock that as well.

Wait, but the final goal is to be in front of a green door (green_door_1) that's unlocked. So green_door_1 connects room_2 and room_4. So to get to green_door_1, the agent needs to be in room_2 or room_4. Let's see possible paths.

Option 1: From room_3, go to room_4 via yellow_door_2. But yellow_door_2 is locked. So first, go to yellow_door_2 in room_3 (gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_3 room_4), toggle it to unlock. Then go to room_4. In room_4, green_door_1 connects to room_2. But the agent is in room_4, so to go to green_door_1, they need to be in room_4. But green_door_1 connects room_2 and room_4. So from room_4, gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2, then toggle it. Then the door becomes unlocked, and the agent can be in front of it. But the goal is to have a green door (which is green_door_1) that's unlocked and be in front of it. So if the agent can get to green_door_1 in room_4, toggle it to unlock, then they are in front of an unlocked green door. But wait, the door starts locked. So need to unlock it. But the problem requires that in the final state, the door is not locked. So the plan would involve toggling it once (from locked to unlocked). 

But let's check the constraints. The constraints are: 

1. At some state, yellow_door_2 must be locked. Since initially, it's locked. So if the agent never touches it, then the initial state satisfies the first constraint. But when the agent toggles it, it would unlock. Then the constraint would require that if at any state yellow_door_2 is locked, then either yellow_door_1 is unlocked or blue_box_1 is in room_2. Since yellow_door_2 starts locked, the initial state meets the first part of the constraint. But in the initial state, yellow_door_1 is locked and blue_box_1 is in room_3. So the initial state violates the constraint? Wait, the constraint says that if in some state s, yellow_door_2 is locked, then in s or a later state, either yellow_door_1 is unlocked or blue_box_1 is in room_2. 

In the initial state, yellow_door_2 is locked. So the constraint requires that either yellow_door_1 is unlocked (it's initially locked) or blue_box_1 is in room_2 (it's in room_3). So the initial state violates the constraint. Therefore, the plan must ensure that whenever yellow_door_2 is locked, then either yellow_door_1 is unlocked or blue_box_1 is in room_2. But since the initial state already violates this, perhaps the agent needs to address this. Wait, no. The problem states that the plan must satisfy the constraints. So the constraints are part of the problem that must be satisfied by the plan. So the initial state is part of the plan's states. Therefore, the initial state must satisfy the constraints. But the initial state has yellow_door_2 locked, and in that state, neither condition (yellow_door_1 unlocked or blue_box_1 in room_2) is true. Therefore, the initial state violates the constraint. Wait, but the problem says the constraints must be satisfied by the plan. So perhaps the constraints are that in all states of the plan, the conditions hold. Wait, the constraints are: "If expression 'yellow_door_2 is locked' holds in some state s, then expression 'At least one of the following conditions is true: yellow_door_1 is not locked, blue_box_1 is in room_2' must hold at s or at some state after s."

So the initial state is a state where yellow_door_2 is locked, but the required conditions (yellow_door_1 unlocked or blue_box_1 in room_2) are not met. Therefore, the initial state violates the constraint. But the problem states that the provided initial state is part of the problem. Therefore, there's a mistake here. Wait, no, perhaps the constraints apply to the plan's execution, not the initial state. But the problem says: "A valid plan must abide by the following constraints: The following expression must hold in at least one state: yellow_door_2 is locked. If expression yellow_door_2 is locked holds in some state s, then the other condition must hold at s or after."

But the initial state already has yellow_door_2 locked, so the plan must satisfy that for the initial state. But the initial state's condition does not meet the required implication. Therefore, the problem as given is impossible unless the initial state is considered as a state where the constraints are met. Wait, but the initial state is given, and the constraints are part of the problem. So perhaps the problem is to create a plan such that all constraints are met during the execution. But the initial state may violate the constraints, but the plan must ensure that any state where yellow_door_2 is locked meets the implication. Wait, no. The constraints are:

1. There must be at least one state where yellow_door_2 is locked. The initial state satisfies this, but after the agent toggles it, it's unlocked. So if the plan includes toggling yellow_door_2 to unlock, then in the initial state, it's locked, but after that, it's unlocked. But the first constraint is satisfied by the initial state. However, the second constraint says that whenever yellow_door_2 is locked in any state s, then in s or a later state, the other condition must hold. So for the initial state, which has yellow_door_2 locked, the plan must ensure that either yellow_door_1 is unlocked or blue_box_1 is in room_2 at some point (including the initial state or later). Since in the initial state, neither is true, the plan must eventually make one of them true.

Therefore, the plan must either unlock yellow_door_1 or move blue_box_1 to room_2. But moving blue_box_1 requires picking it up. The blue_box_1 is in room_3 initially, where the agent starts. So the agent can pick it up if they are in room_3 and in front of it, then carry it to room_2. But how?

Wait, the agent starts in room_3. To pick up blue_box_1, they need to go to it (gotoobject blue_box_1 room_3), then pick it up. Then they can carry it. Then they need to take it to room_2. To get to room_2 from room_3: possible paths. From room_3, the doors are grey_door_1 (to room_1) and yellow_door_2 (to room_4). To get to room_2, maybe go room_3 -> room_1 via grey_door_1, then room_1 -> room_2 via yellow_door_1. But doors are locked initially. So the agent needs to unlock them.

Alternative: from room_3, unlock grey_door_1, go to room_1. Then unlock yellow_door_1 (which is in room_1), then go to room_2. Then drop blue_box_1 in room_2. That would satisfy the constraint when blue_box_1 is in room_2. Then, after that, even if yellow_door_2 is locked again (if the agent toggles it back), but the plan must ensure that whenever yellow_door_2 is locked, either condition holds. However, the first constraint is that yellow_door_2 must be locked in at least one state. Since the initial state has it locked, that's satisfied. But the agent might unlock it, so if the plan never re-locks it, then the only state where it's locked is the initial state. But the constraint is satisfied. However, the agent's actions may require toggling doors, which could lock them again, but that's up to the plan.

So the plan needs to either unlock yellow_door_1 or move blue_box_1 to room_2. Let's consider moving blue_box_1 to room_2. Let's outline steps:

1. In room_3: gotoobject blue_box_1 room_3
2. pick blue_box_1 room_3
3. Now, need to go to room_2. Path: room_3 -> room_1 via grey_door_1. But grey_door_1 is locked. So agent must first goto grey_door_1 in room_3, toggle it (unlock), then go to room_1. Then from room_1, go to yellow_door_1 (connecting to room_2), which is locked. So toggle it to unlock, then go to room_2. Then drop the box.

But during this process, the agent is carrying the box. Let's write the steps:

1. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1
   - Preconditions: in room_3, which is connected via grey_door_1, and no object blocking. Assuming no blocking, so possible.
2. toggle grey_door_1 (unlocks it)
3. gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1
4. Now in room_1. Need to go to yellow_door_1 to reach room_2. So:
5. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2
6. toggle yellow_door_1 (unlocks it)
7. gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1
8. Now in room_2. Drop the box here.
   - Need to gotoempty in room_2 to drop.
9. gotoempty
10. drop blue_box_1 room_2
Now blue_box_1 is in room_2. This satisfies the condition that if yellow_door_2 is locked (as in the initial state), then blue_box_1 is in room_2 at some later state. So the constraint is satisfied.

Now, the main goal is to be in front of a green door (green_door_1) which is unlocked. green_door_1 connects room_2 and room_4. So the agent needs to be in front of green_door_1 in either room_2 or room_4. Let's see. From room_2, green_door_1 connects to room_4. So the agent can go to green_door_1 in room_2, toggle it (unlock), then be in front of it. But green_door_1 is initially locked. So steps:

After dropping the box in room_2, the agent is in room_2. Now:

11. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4
12. toggle green_door_1 (unlocks it)
13. Now, the agent is in front of green_door_1 (which is green), and the door is unlocked. This meets the goal.

But wait, the goal is "There is a door d such that d is green, you are in front of d, and d is not locked." So in this case, after step 12, the agent is in front of green_door_1 (d is green), door is now unlocked. So that's the goal. Then the plan would be:

But let's check the steps again. After dropping the box in room_2 (step 10), the agent is in room_2. Then:

11. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4
    - Precondition: in room_2, which is connected via green_door_1 to room_4. Assuming no objects blocking, so possible.
12. toggle green_door_1 (unlocks it)
    - Now, green_door_1 is unlocked.
    - Agent is in front of green_door_1, which is green and now unlocked. So goal achieved.

But wait, the initial constraint required that whenever yellow_door_2 is locked, the condition holds. In this plan, after moving the box to room_2, any state where yellow_door_2 is locked (like the initial state) is addressed by the box being in room_2 later. So the constraint is satisfied.

But what about yellow_door_2 in other states? Suppose during the plan, the agent unlocks yellow_door_2. For example, if the agent goes back to room_3 and toggles it again, but that's not needed here. The plan as outlined doesn't touch yellow_door_2, so it remains locked. But the constraint is already satisfied because the initial state's lock is addressed by moving the box to room_2. So the plan is valid.

But let's check all steps:

1. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1
2. toggle grey_door_1 (now unlocked)
3. gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1 (now in room_1)
4. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2
5. toggle yellow_door_1 (now unlocked)
6. gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1 (now in room_2)
7. gotoempty (to drop the box)
8. drop blue_box_1 room_2
9. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4
10. toggle green_door_1 (unlocked)
   
Wait, but steps 1-10 would be the actions. Let me recount:

Original steps after initial steps:

1. goto grey_door_1 (room3)
2. toggle
3. goto room1
4. goto yellow_door_1 (room1)
5. toggle
6. goto room2
7. goto empty
8. drop
9. goto green_door_1 (room2)
10. toggle

But initial steps also require picking up the box. Oh right! The agent needs to pick up the box in room3 before moving. So the steps are:

1. gotoobject blue_box_1 room3
2. pick blue_box_1 room3
3. gotodoor grey_door_1 room3 room1
4. toggle grey_door_1
5. gotoroom room3 room1 grey_door_1
6. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room1 room2
7. toggle yellow_door_1
8. gotoroom room1 room2 yellow_door_1
9. gotoempty
10. drop blue_box_1 room2
11. gotodoor green_door_1 room2 room4
12. toggle green_door_1

So the plan would have 12 steps, leading to the agent being in front of green_door_1 (green) which is unlocked. 

Additionally, the constraints are satisfied because:

- The initial state has yellow_door_2 locked. The plan moves blue_box_1 to room2, so in later states, if yellow_door_2 is locked (as in initial state), the condition blue_box_1 in room2 is met. Also, the first constraint is met because the initial state has yellow_door_2 locked.

But wait, the plan does not involve yellow_door_2 at all. So after the initial state, yellow_door_2 remains locked unless someone toggles it. But in this plan, the agent never touches yellow_door_2, so it remains locked. Therefore, in the initial state, it's locked, and in all subsequent states, it's still locked unless the agent toggles it. But the agent doesn't, so it remains locked. However, the constraint requires that whenever yellow_door_2 is locked in any state, then the condition holds in that state or later. Since in the initial state, blue_box_1 is in room3, but after step 10, it's in room2. So for the initial state (s0), the condition is that in s0 or later, yellow_door_1 is unlocked or blue_box_1 in room2. Since in later states (after step10), blue_box_1 is in room2, the constraint is satisfied for s0. 

Other states where yellow_door_2 is locked: all states in this plan. Because the agent never toggles it. So every state after the initial state, yellow_door_2 is still locked. So the constraint must be satisfied for each of these states. For example, after the agent is in room1, yellow_door_2 is still locked. At that point, the condition must hold in that state or later. At that point, blue_box_1 hasn't been moved yet, but in a later state (step10), it is moved. So the condition is satisfied for those intermediate states because in a later state, blue_box_1 is in room2.

Therefore, this plan satisfies all constraints and the goal.

But wait, the goal is to have the agent in front of a green door (green_door_1) that's unlocked. After step12, the agent is in front of green_door_1, which is now unlocked. So that's the goal.

Now, let's check if this plan is optimal (shortest possible). Are there any shorter plans?

Alternative approach: Maybe the agent can reach green_door_1 via room4. Let's see.

From room3, go to yellow_door_2 (unlock it), go to room4, then go to green_door_1 (which connects room4 to room2). But green_door_1 is locked. So need to unlock it. But that would require:

1. goto yellow_door_2 in room3
2. toggle (unlock)
3. goto room4
4. goto green_door_1 in room4
5. toggle (unlock)
6. Now in front of green_door_1 (green and unlocked)

But then, what about the constraints? In this plan, the initial state has yellow_door_2 locked. Then, after step2, it's unlocked. So the only state where yellow_door_2 is locked is the initial state. So the first constraint is satisfied. The second constraint requires that whenever yellow_door_2 is locked (initial state), then in that state or later, yellow_door_1 is unlocked or blue_box_1 in room2. In this alternative plan, blue_box_1 remains in room3. So the agent would have to ensure that yellow_door_1 is unlocked. But in this plan, the agent never unlocks yellow_door_1. Therefore, the constraint is violated because the initial state's yellow_door_2 is locked, and in no state after is yellow_door_1 unlocked or blue_box_1 in room2. So this plan would not satisfy the constraint.

Therefore, the initial plan where the agent moves blue_box_1 to room2 is necessary to satisfy the constraints.

Thus, the original plan is valid and optimal, as it's the shortest way to satisfy all conditions.
