Okay, let's tackle this planning problem step by step. So, the goal is to have a grey box that I'm holding. The initial state has me in room_3, and there are two grey boxes there: grey_box_1 and grey_box_2. But the constraints say that I must be in front of grey_box_1 at some point, and before that, I must have been in room_4. Hmm, tricky.

First, I need to get to room_4 because the constraint requires that before being in front of grey_box_1, I was in room_4. But how do I get to room_4 from room_3? The doors between rooms: room_3 is connected to room_1 via grey_door_2 (locked), and to room_4 via red_door_1 (also locked). So I need to unlock red_door_1. But to toggle a door, I need to be in front of it. So first, go to red_door_1 in room_3. Wait, but the red_door_1 connects room_3 and room_4. So in room_3, I can go to red_door_1. But is there any object blocking it? The initial state in room_3 has grey_box_1, grey_box_2, and purple_ball_2. If any of these are in front of the door, they might block it. The problem says the "goto door" action requires that the position in front of the door is not blocked. So maybe I need to check if those objects are blocking the door. But the problem doesn't specify their positions, so perhaps we can assume they aren't blocking unless stated. So maybe I can go to the red_door_1 in room_3, toggle it to unlock, then go to room_4.

Wait, but all doors are initially locked. So I need to toggle them. So steps:

1. Go to red_door_1 in room_3 (since I'm in room_3, and red_door_1 connects room_3 and room_4). So "gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_4". But wait, the action is "gotodoor d r1 r2", so the door connects r1 and r2. So in room_3, the door is red_door_1 connecting to room_4. So yes, I can perform "gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_4". Then "toggle red_door_1" to unlock it. Then "gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_1" to move to room_4. That gets me into room_4. But why do I need to go to room_4? Because the constraint says that if I'm in front of grey_box_1, I must have been in room_4 before. So after going to room_4, I need to come back to room_3 to pick up grey_box_1. But wait, the boxes are in room_3. So after going to room_4, I can return to room_3 through red_door_1 again. Wait, but after unlocking, the door is now unlocked. So maybe after entering room_4, I can go back. But how does that help me with the constraint? The constraint says that being in front of grey_box_1 must have a prior state where I was in room_4. So the sequence would be: go to room_4 (so now I have visited it), then return to room_3, go to grey_box_1, pick it up. But the problem is, the initial state has me in room_3. So the steps would be:

Current room: room_3.

1. gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_4
2. toggle red_door_1 (unlocks it)
3. gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_1 (now in room_4)
4. Now, I need to get back to room_3 to access grey_box_1. So from room_4, use red_door_1 again. But to do that, I need to go to the door in room_4. So:

4. gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_3 (since the door connects room_4 and room_3)
5. toggle red_door_1 (but wait, after step 2, the door was unlocked. Toggling it again would lock it. But I need it to stay unlocked to go back. Wait, the initial action of toggling in step 2 would unlock it. Then when I use gotoroom to go to room_4, the door remains unlocked unless I toggle it again. So after step 3, the door is unlocked. So when I want to go back, I can just use it again without toggling. Wait, no: the door is between room_3 and room_4. When I'm in room_4, the door is the same red_door_1. So to go back, I need to be in front of the door in room_4. So:

In room_4, perform gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_3. Then, since the door is already unlocked, gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_1. So steps 4 and 5:

4. gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_3
5. gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_1 (back to room_3)

Now, in room_3 again. Then, go to grey_box_1 in room_3. So:

6. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_3
7. pick grey_box_1 room_3

But wait, the constraint says that when I'm in front of grey_box_1 (step 6), there must have been an earlier state where I was in room_4 (step 3 and 4). Yes, step 3 was entering room_4, step 4 was going to the door in room_4. So that satisfies the constraint.

But wait, step 4 is in room_4. So after step 3, I was in room_4, then step 4 is gotodoor in room_4. So the state where I was in room_4 is step 3. Then step 6 is being in front of grey_box_1, which comes after step 5 (returning to room_3). So the earlier state (step 3) is before step 6. That satisfies the constraint.

So the plan would be:

1. gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_4
2. toggle red_door_1
3. gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_1
4. gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_3
5. gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_1
6. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_3
7. pick grey_box_1 room_3

But wait, step 4 and 5 might not be necessary if after step 3, I can just go back. But perhaps the door remains unlocked, so after step 3, I can immediately go back. Wait, no. Because after step 3, the agent is in room_4. To go back, they need to go to the door in room_4. So steps 4 and 5 are needed to return to room_3.

Alternatively, maybe there's a shorter path. Let's check.

Another approach: Maybe instead of going to room_4, just going to the door in room_3, toggling it, and then going to room_4, then immediately coming back. But the constraint requires that the agent was in room_4 at some point before being in front of grey_box_1. So even if they go to room_4 and come back, that satisfies the constraint.

So steps:

1. gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_4
2. toggle red_door_1 (unlock)
3. gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_1 (now in room_4)
4. gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_3
5. gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_1 (back to room_3)
6. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_3
7. pick grey_box_1 room_3

This plan has 7 steps. But maybe there's a shorter way. Let's see.

Wait, is there a way to not have to go back to room_3? Because the boxes are in room_3. So the agent needs to be in room_3 to pick up the grey_box. So the agent starts in room_3, goes to room_4 (steps 1-3), then returns (steps 4-5), then picks up the box. That's necessary.

Alternatively, can the agent unlock the door, go to room_4 (step 3), then without returning, do something else? But the goal requires holding a grey box, which are in room_3. So the agent must return to room_3. So steps 4-5 are needed.

But maybe after step 3 (in room_4), the agent can do something else that's required. But the goal is just to hold a grey box. The only grey boxes are in room_3. So yes, the agent has to go back.

So the steps as above are necessary.

Now, check the constraints:

- The constraint that "you are in front of grey_box_1" must hold in at least one state. Step 6 is that.

- The other constraint: if in front of grey_box_1 (step 6), then must have been in room_4 before (step 3). So yes.

So the plan is valid.

Now, check if all preconditions are met.

Step 1: goto door red_door_1 in room_3. Precondition: in the same room (yes, starting in room_3) and no object blocking. Assuming no objects are blocking, this is allowed.

Step 2: toggle door. Since in front of it, allowed.

Step 3: goto room_4 via red_door_1. Door is unlocked now, so allowed.

Step 4: in room_4, goto door red_door_1 (connecting room_4 to room_3). Precondition: in room_4, which is true. No blocking object. So allowed.

Step 5: go back to room_3. Door is still unlocked, so allowed.

Step 6: gotoobject grey_box_1 in room_3. Yes, in same room.

Step 7: pick up. Hands are empty, in same room. So allowed.

Thus, this plan should work. Let's count the steps: 7 actions. Is there a shorter plan?

Alternative: After step 3 (in room_4), maybe there's a way to not have to go back through the door. But since the agent needs to get back to room_3 to pick up the box, that's necessary. So I think this is the minimal steps.
