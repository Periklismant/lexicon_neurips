Alright, let's understand the problem:

We're in a gridworld with 4 rooms arranged in a square. There are doors connecting the rooms, as well as boxes and balls in different rooms. We start in room_3 and need to end up holding a grey box.

The available actions include going to an object, going to an empty position, going to a door, going from one room to another through a door, picking up an object, dropping an object, and toggling (locking/unlocking) doors.

Let's first summarize the initial state and goal:

**Initial State:**
- We are in room_3.
- There are various balls and boxes in different rooms, including two grey boxes (grey_box_1 and grey_box_2) in room_3.
- All doors are locked.
- We're not holding any object.

**Goal:**
- We need to be holding a grey box.

**Constraints:**
- At some point, we need to be in front of grey_box_1.
- Before being in front of grey_box_1, we need to have been in room_4.

Given that we are in room_3 and grey_box_1 is also in room_3, it might seem straightforward to just go to grey_box_1 and pick it up. However, the constraints say that before being in front of grey_box_1, we must have been in room_4. Therefore, we first need to go to room_4 before going to grey_box_1.

Let's think about a plan:

1. We need to go from room_3 to room_4. Since the red_door_1 connecting them is locked, we need to go to the door first, toggle it to unlock, and then go through.
2. Once in room_4, we can come back to room_3 through the same door.
3. In room_3, we can go to grey_box_1, pick it up, and satisfy the goal.

Let's write this plan out more formally using the given actions:

1. `gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_4`: Go to the door connecting room_3 and room_4.
2. `toggle red_door_1`: Unlock the door.
3. `gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_1`: Go to room_4.
4. `gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_1`: Return to room_3.
5. `gotoobject grey_box_1 room_3`: Go to grey_box_1.
6. `pick grey_box_1 room_3`: Pick up grey_box_1.

Let's check if this plan satisfies the constraints:
- "At some point, we need to be in front of grey_box_1." This is satisfied in step 5.
- "Before being in front of grey_box_1, we need to have been in room_4." This is satisfied since we go to room_4 in step 3, which is before going to grey_box_1 in step 5.

Now let's check if this plan is valid according to the action preconditions:

1. `gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_4`: We're in room_3, and red_door_1 connects room_3 and room_4. As long as there's no object blocking the door in room_3, this action is valid. There's no mention of any object blocking doors, so we're good.
2. `toggle red_door_1`: We are now in front of red_door_1, so we can toggle it.
3. `gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_1`: We're in room_3, and room_3 is adjacent to room_4 via red_door_1. red_door_1 is now unlocked, so we can go through.
4. `gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_1`: We're in room_4, and room_4 is adjacent to room_3 via red_door_1. red_door_1 is unlocked, so we can go through.
5. `gotoobject grey_box_1 room_3`: We're in room_3, and grey_box_1 is in room_3, so we can go to it.
6. `pick grey_box_1 room_3`: We're in front of grey_box_1, which is in room_3, and our hands are empty, so we can pick it up.

The plan is valid, and it satisfies the goal and constraints. 

Let's double-check the optimality of the plan:

Our goal is to be holding a grey box, and there are two grey boxes in the initial state: grey_box_1 and grey_box_2, both in room_3.

Since the constraint requires that we first visit room_4 before going to grey_box_1, we need to include steps 1-4 if we're using grey_box_1. But if we're using grey_box_2, we still need to have been in room_4 before going to grey_box_1, even if we don't end up picking grey_box_1. So, if we want to pick grey_box_2, our plan would be:

1. `gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_4`: Go to the door connecting room_3 and room_4.
2. `toggle red_door_1`: Unlock the door.
3. `gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_1`: Go to room_4.
4. `gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_1`: Return to room_3.
5. `gotoobject grey_box_1 room_3`: Go to grey_box_1 (to satisfy the constraint).
6. `gotoobject grey_box_2 room_3`: Go to grey_box_2.
7. `pick grey_box_2 room_3`: Pick up grey_box_2.

This plan is longer than the one where we simply pick up grey_box_1, so the plan we've already outlined is optimal.

Let's see if there could be even more optimal plans:

- Could we pick up grey_box_1 without going to room_4 first?
  - No, because of the constraint that says before being in front of grey_box_1, we must have been in room_4.

- Could we just go to grey_box_2 without going to grey_box_1 or room_4?
  - No, because the constraint requires that at some point, we are in front of grey_box_1. And before being in front of grey_box_1, we must have been in room_4.

So, the plan we've outlined (picking up grey_box_1 after going to room_4) seems to be the most optimal.

Actually, let me re-read the constraints to make sure I understand them correctly:

1. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'you are in front of grey_box_1'" - This means at some point in our plan, we must be in front of grey_box_1.
2. "If expression 'you are in front of grey_box_1' holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: 'you are in room_4'" - This means if we ever are in front of grey_box_1, then at some point before that, we must have been in room_4.

So the constraint 2 is only applicable if we're ever in front of grey_box_1. However, constraint 1 requires that we indeed are in front of grey_box_1 at some point. So, we do need to go to room_4 first, then come back to room_3 to go to grey_box_1.

Given the constraints, our outlined plan (go to room_4, come back to room_3, go to grey_box_1, and pick it up) is optimal.

Let's finalize the plan:

```
gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_4
toggle red_door_1
gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_1
gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_1
gotoobject grey_box_1 room_3
pick grey_box_1 room_3
```

Actually, let's think even more about the problem statement. The goal is to be holding a grey box. While both grey_box_1 and grey_box_2 are grey boxes, the constraints specifically mention grey_box_1, but only in relation to us being in front of it at some point, and having been in room_4 before that.

There's a potential optimization here: after going to room_4 and coming back to room_3, if we first go to grey_box_2 (to satisfy the goal of holding a grey box) and then go to grey_box_1 (to satisfy the constraint), we might save a step, as we wouldn't need to pick up grey_box_1.

But wait, there's a problem. If we're holding grey_box_2, we can't pick up grey_box_1, and the plan wouldn't satisfy the goal if we don't pick up grey_box_1 (because we're already holding grey_box_2).

So, if by "being in front of grey_box_1" the constraint means we just need to approach it (without necessarily picking it up), then we could go to grey_box_2 first, pick it up, and then go to grey_box_1 (just to satisfy the constraint).

But, considering the preconditions for the `gotoobject` action, which states that "you may only go in front of an object x if you are in the same room as x", we can only go in front of grey_box_1 if we are in the same room as it, which is room_3. So, after going to room_4 and coming back to room_3, it seems most straightforward to just go to grey_box_1, pick it up, and be done with it.

Ok, the optimal plan seems to be the one we've outlined. But let's double-check:

**Optimal Plan:**
1. `gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_4`: Go to the door connecting room_3 and room_4.
2. `toggle red_door_1`: Unlock the door.
3. `gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_1`: Go to room_4.
4. `gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_1`: Return to room_3.
5. `gotoobject grey_box_1 room_3`: Go to grey_box_1.
6. `pick grey_box_1 room_3`: Pick up grey_box_1.

I think this is the optimal plan. Let's double check the requirements one more time:

**Goal:** "There is a box v such that "The following conditions are all true: "v is grey", "you are holding v"""
- The plan accomplishes this goal by having the agent hold grey_box_1, which is indeed a grey box.

**Constraints:**
1. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'you are in front of grey_box_1'"
   - The agent is in front of grey_box_1 in step 5, so this constraint is satisfied.
2. "If expression 'you are in front of grey_box_1' holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: 'you are in room_4'"
   - The agent is in room_4 in step 3, which is before being in front of grey_box_1 in step 5, so this constraint is satisfied.

The plan is valid and optimal.

Actually, let me check if room_3 is really the initial starting position, to make sure we don't need an additional action to get there. The problem statement says, "you are in room_3," so we do indeed start in room_3.

Also, let me double-check the relationship between rooms to make sure the doors as described make sense:
- room_1 (north-west) and room_2 (south-west) are connected via grey_door_1
- room_1 (north-west) and room_3 (north-east) are connected via grey_door_2
- room_2 (south-west) and room_4 (south-east) are connected via grey_door_3
- room_3 (north-east) and room_4 (south-east) are connected via red_door_1

This makes topological sense: the doors connect adjacent rooms. The rooms are arranged as:

```
room_1 --- room_3
   |         |
   |         |
room_2 --- room_4
```

And the connections as described match that layout.

Alright, so we start in room_3 (north-east), and need to go to room_4 (south-east), then come back to room_3 to pick up grey_box_1.

Our final plan is:

```
gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_4
toggle red_door_1
gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_1
gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_1
gotoobject grey_box_1 room_3
pick grey_box_1 room_3
```

This plan satisfies the goal and all constraints.
