Okay, let me try to figure out how to solve this planning problem. The goal is to have a yellow ball in room_3, be in room_3, and be in front of that ball. The constraints aren't listed here, but the initial state is given, so I need to work with that.

First, let's look at the initial state. The agent starts in room_4. The yellow balls in the world are yellow_ball_1 (in room_1), yellow_ball_2 (room_3), yellow_ball_3 (room_4), and there's a yellow_box_1 in room_4. The doors are all locked initially. So green_door_1 connects room_1 and room_2, green_door_2 connects room_1 and room_3, blue_door_1 connects room_2 and room_4, and red_door_1 connects room_3 and room_4. All doors are locked.

The goal requires a yellow ball (v) to be in room_3, the agent to be in room_3, and in front of v. So possible candidates for v are yellow_ball_2 (already in room_3) or moving another yellow ball there, like yellow_ball_1 or yellow_ball_3.

But let's check where they are. Yellow_ball_2 is already in room_3. So if that's the case, maybe the plan is to go to room_3, go in front of yellow_ball_2. But wait, the agent starts in room_4. How to get to room_3?

From room_4, the connected rooms via doors are room_2 (blue_door_1) and room_3 (red_door_1). But both doors are locked. So the agent needs to unlock one of those doors to move. But to unlock a door, the agent needs to be in front of it and toggle it. But to get in front of a door, they must be in a room connected by that door. For example, to toggle red_door_1, which connects room_3 and room_4, the agent is in room_4. But the door is in room_4's connection to room_3. So the agent can go to the door in room_4, but the door might be blocked by an object.

Wait, the initial state says that yellow_box_1 is in room_4. But does it block the door? The problem states that "the position in front of d in the room you are currently in" must not be blocked. So if there's an object in front of the door in room_4, then the agent can't go there. But in the initial state, is the yellow_box_1 blocking a door?

Looking at the initial state, the objects in room_4 are red_ball_2, yellow_ball_3, and yellow_box_1. But their positions aren't specified. The problem mentions that doors may be blocked by objects if they are in front of them. Since the initial state doesn't mention any door being blocked, we can assume that the doors aren't blocked. So the agent can go to the doors in their current room.

So the agent is in room_4. To get to room_3, they can use red_door_1. But red_door_1 is locked. So the steps would be:

1. Go to red_door_1 in room_4 (since the agent is in room_4, they can go to the door).
2. Toggle red_door_1 to unlock it.
3. Then use gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_1 to move to room_3.

Once in room_3, check if yellow_ball_2 is there. It is. Then the agent needs to be in front of it. So:

4. Gotoobject yellow_ball_2 room_3.

But wait, the agent needs to first go to room_3. Let's outline the steps:

- Current location: room_4.

Action 1: gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_3. Precondition: agent is in a room connected by red_door_1 (yes, room_4), and no object is blocking the door in room_4. Assuming no blocking, this is possible.

Action 2: toggle red_door_1. Since the agent is in front of the door, this will unlock it.

Action 3: gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_1. Now agent is in room_3.

Now, in room_3, yellow_ball_2 is present. So:

Action 4: gotoobject yellow_ball_2 room_3.

This would satisfy the goal: the agent is in room_3, in front of yellow_ball_2, which is yellow and in room_3.

But wait, the problem's goal is "there exists a ball v such that v is yellow, in room_3, agent is in room_3, and in front of v". Since yellow_ball_2 is already in room_3, the plan can be to move to room_3 and then go to that ball.

But the initial doors are all locked, so the steps above are necessary.

But wait, when moving through doors, the agent must be in front of the door first? Wait, the gotoroom action requires that the agent is in a room adjacent via the door, and the door is unlocked. The gotoroom action's preconditions don't require the agent to be in front of the door. So perhaps the steps are:

From room_4, the agent can use the red_door_1 to get to room_3. But first, the door must be unlocked.

So steps:

1. gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_3 (since agent is in room_4, which is connected to room_3 via red_door_1).

2. toggle red_door_1 (unlocking it).

3. gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_1 (move to room_3).

4. gotoobject yellow_ball_2 room_3.

That's four actions. Is there a shorter way? Let's check if any other doors can be used. For example, from room_4 to room_2 via blue_door_1, but that's also locked. Unlocking blue_door_1 would require going to it in room_4. But then moving to room_2, but then how to get to room_3? From room_2, the doors are green_door_1 (to room_1) and blue_door_1 (to room_4). To get to room_3 from room_2, you'd have to go through room_4 via red_door_1, but that's longer. So the direct path via red_door_1 is better.

So the plan would be the four steps above. But wait, after toggling the door, is the agent still in front of the door? Let's think about the effects of the actions.

After gotodoor red_door_1, the agent is in front of the door. Then, toggle red_door_1 (which requires being in front of it). Toggling it changes the state from locked to unlocked. Then, gotoroom moves the agent to room_3, and they are no longer in front of the door.

So the sequence is valid.

Alternatively, after unlocking the door, can the agent directly go to room_3 without needing to be in front of the door again? Wait, the gotoroom action's preconditions are:

- you are in room r0 adjacent to r (room_4 is adjacent to room_3 via red_door_1).

- the door connecting r0 and r is unlocked (after toggle, yes).

So the agent doesn't need to be in front of the door to use gotoroom. Wait, but how does the movement work? The gotoroom action's preconditions don't require being in front of the door. So perhaps the agent can be anywhere in the room. So perhaps the steps could be:

1. toggle red_door_1 (but to do that, the agent must be in front of the door. So first, they need to goto the door.)

So the steps must be:

1. gotodoor red_door_1 room4 room3.

2. toggle red_door_1 (unlock).

3. gotoroom room4 room3 red_door_1.

4. gotoobject yellow_ball_2 room3.

So that's four steps.

Is there a way to have a shorter plan? Let's see. Suppose the agent can directly go to room3 after unlocking the door. The steps are necessary. So four steps.

But wait, maybe the yellow_ball_3 in room4 is also yellow. If the agent can pick it up and carry it to room3. But that would require:

- picking up yellow_ball_3 in room4.

Then moving to room3, but that requires unlocking red_door_1 first. Then dropping it in room3, and being in front of it. But that would take more steps.

Let's compare:

Option 1: Use existing yellow_ball_2 in room3. Steps: 4.

Option 2: Bring another yellow ball to room3. Steps would be:

1. gotoobject yellow_ball_3 room4.

2. pick yellow_ball_3 room4.

3. gotodoor red_door_1 room4 room3.

4. toggle red_door_1.

5. gotoroom room4 room3 red_door_1.

6. drop yellow_ball_3 room3.

7. gotoobject yellow_ball_3 room3.

That's 7 steps, which is longer. So option 1 is better.

Thus, the optimal plan is the four steps mentioned earlier.

But wait, let's check if yellow_ball_2 is indeed in room3. According to the initial state: yellow_ball_2 is in room3. So that's correct.

So the plan is:

1. gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_3

2. toggle red_door_1

3. gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_1

4. gotoobject yellow_ball_2 room_3

Now, check preconditions:

- After step 1, agent is in front of red_door_1.

- Step 2: toggle requires being in front of the door, which is true.

- Toggling unlocks the door.

- Step 3: gotoroom from room4 to room3 via red_door_1, which is now unlocked.

- Step 4: in room3, gotoobject yellow_ball_2. Since agent is in room3, this is allowed.

This satisfies the goal: the agent is in room3, in front of yellow_ball_2, which is yellow and in room3.

So this should be the optimal plan.
