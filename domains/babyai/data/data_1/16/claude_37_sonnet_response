Let me analyze the problem:

1. We have 4 rooms arranged in a square:
   - room_1 (north-west)
   - room_2 (south-west)
   - room_3 (north-east)
   - room_4 (south-east)

2. Doors connecting the rooms:
   - green_door_1 connects room_1 and room_2
   - green_door_2 connects room_1 and room_3
   - blue_door_1 connects room_2 and room_4
   - red_door_1 connects room_3 and room_4

3. Initial state:
   - We are in room_4
   - yellow_ball_1 is in room_1
   - red_ball_1, purple_ball_1, green_ball_1 are in room_2
   - yellow_ball_2 is in room_3
   - red_ball_2, yellow_ball_3, yellow_box_1 are in room_4
   - All doors are locked
   - We are not holding any object

4. Goal:
   - We need to be in room_3
   - There should be a yellow ball in room_3
   - We should be in front of this yellow ball

5. Constraint:
   - At some point, green_door_2 (connecting room_1 and room_3) must be unlocked

Let's think through this problem step by step.

First, we need to identify possible paths from our starting position (room_4) to room_3. We can either:
1. Go directly from room_4 to room_3 through red_door_1
2. Go from room_4 to room_2 through blue_door_1, then to room_1 through green_door_1, and finally to room_3 through green_door_2

Since we have a constraint that green_door_2 must be unlocked at some point, we'll need to take the second path.

In the goal, we need a yellow ball in room_3. There are already one yellow ball in room_3 (yellow_ball_2). But we also have yellow_ball_1 in room_1 and yellow_ball_3 in room_4. For simplicity, we'll aim to use yellow_ball_2 which is already in room_3.

Now, let's start planning:

1. First, let's go to blue_door_1 and unlock it to go to room_2:
   - gotodoor blue_door_1 room_4 room_2
   - toggle blue_door_1
   - gotoroom room_4 room_2 blue_door_1

2. Next, let's go to green_door_1 and unlock it to go to room_1:
   - gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_1
   - toggle green_door_1
   - gotoroom room_2 room_1 green_door_1

3. Now, let's go to green_door_2 and unlock it to go to room_3 (satisfying our constraint):
   - gotodoor green_door_2 room_1 room_3
   - toggle green_door_2
   - gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_2

4. Finally, let's go to yellow_ball_2 in room_3:
   - gotoobject yellow_ball_2 room_3

This plan should meet our goal and the constraint. Let's verify:

We start in room_4, unlock blue_door_1, go to room_2, unlock green_door_1, go to room_1, unlock green_door_2 (satisfying our constraint), go to room_3, and finally go to yellow_ball_2. This should result in us being in room_3, in front of a yellow ball (yellow_ball_2).

However, I need to make sure the actions and their preconditions are correctly applied. Let's go through the actions one by one.

1. `gotodoor blue_door_1 room_4 room_2`:
   - Precondition: We need to be in room_4, which we are.
   - Precondition: blue_door_1 connects room_4 and room_2, which it does.
   - Effect: We're in front of blue_door_1.

2. `toggle blue_door_1`:
   - Precondition: We need to be in front of blue_door_1, which we are after the previous action.
   - Effect: blue_door_1 is unlocked.

3. `gotoroom room_4 room_2 blue_door_1`:
   - Precondition: We need to be in room_4, which we are.
   - Precondition: blue_door_1 connects room_4 and room_2, which it does.
   - Precondition: blue_door_1 is unlocked, which it is after the previous action.
   - Effect: We're now in room_2.

4. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_1`:
   - Precondition: We need to be in room_2, which we are.
   - Precondition: green_door_1 connects room_2 and room_1, which it does.
   - Effect: We're in front of green_door_1.

5. `toggle green_door_1`:
   - Precondition: We need to be in front of green_door_1, which we are after the previous action.
   - Effect: green_door_1 is unlocked.

6. `gotoroom room_2 room_1 green_door_1`:
   - Precondition: We need to be in room_2, which we are.
   - Precondition: green_door_1 connects room_2 and room_1, which it does.
   - Precondition: green_door_1 is unlocked, which it is after the previous action.
   - Effect: We're now in room_1.

7. `gotodoor green_door_2 room_1 room_3`:
   - Precondition: We need to be in room_1, which we are.
   - Precondition: green_door_2 connects room_1 and room_3, which it does.
   - Effect: We're in front of green_door_2.

8. `toggle green_door_2`:
   - Precondition: We need to be in front of green_door_2, which we are after the previous action.
   - Effect: green_door_2 is unlocked (satisfying our constraint).

9. `gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_2`:
   - Precondition: We need to be in room_1, which we are.
   - Precondition: green_door_2 connects room_1 and room_3, which it does.
   - Precondition: green_door_2 is unlocked, which it is after the previous action.
   - Effect: We're now in room_3.

10. `gotoobject yellow_ball_2 room_3`:
    - Precondition: We need to be in room_3, which we are.
    - Precondition: yellow_ball_2 is in room_3, which it is.
    - Effect: We're in front of yellow_ball_2.

Great! This plan should meet our goal and the constraint.

However, I wonder if there's a shorter path. Let's double check.

Actually, I just realized that since we just need to ensure that green_door_2 is unlocked at some point, we don't necessarily need to go through it. We could go directly from room_4 to room_3 through red_door_1, and then at some point, we could unlock green_door_2 without going through it. But I also need to make sure if that's valid according to the problem statement.

From the action descriptions:
- "toggle": you may only toggle a door d if you are in front of d.

So, we would need to be in front of green_door_2 to unlock it. This means we would need to be in either room_1 or room_3, depending on the door's orientation.

Let's re-consider our plan. We could optimize by going directly from room_4 to room_3 through red_door_1, and then going to green_door_2 from room_3, unlocking it, and then going back to yellow_ball_2. This way, we'll have a shorter path.

Here's the revised plan:

1. Go to red_door_1 and unlock it to go to room_3:
   - gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_3
   - toggle red_door_1
   - gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_1

2. Go to green_door_2 and unlock it (satisfying our constraint), but don't necessarily use it:
   - gotodoor green_door_2 room_3 room_1
   - toggle green_door_2

3. Go to yellow_ball_2 in room_3:
   - gotoobject yellow_ball_2 room_3

This revised plan should still meet our goal and the constraint, but with fewer steps.

Let's verify:

1. `gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_3`:
   - Precondition: We need to be in room_4, which we are.
   - Precondition: red_door_1 connects room_4 and room_3, which it does.
   - Effect: We're in front of red_door_1.

2. `toggle red_door_1`:
   - Precondition: We need to be in front of red_door_1, which we are after the previous action.
   - Effect: red_door_1 is unlocked.

3. `gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_1`:
   - Precondition: We need to be in room_4, which we are.
   - Precondition: red_door_1 connects room_4 and room_3, which it does.
   - Precondition: red_door_1 is unlocked, which it is after the previous action.
   - Effect: We're now in room_3.

4. `gotodoor green_door_2 room_3 room_1`:
   - Precondition: We need to be in room_3, which we are.
   - Precondition: green_door_2 connects room_3 and room_1, which it does.
   - Effect: We're in front of green_door_2.

5. `toggle green_door_2`:
   - Precondition: We need to be in front of green_door_2, which we are after the previous action.
   - Effect: green_door_2 is unlocked (satisfying our constraint).

6. `gotoobject yellow_ball_2 room_3`:
   - Precondition: We need to be in room_3, which we are.
   - Precondition: yellow_ball_2 is in room_3, which it is.
   - Effect: We're in front of yellow_ball_2.

I think this revised plan is valid and meets our goal with the constraint satisfied.

Wait, I need to double-check something. The goal stated:
"There is a ball v such that "The following conditions are all true: "v is yellow", "v is in room_3", "you are in room_3", "you are in front of v""

Let's ensure that yellow_ball_2 is actually yellow and in room_3:
- "yellow_ball_2 is in room_3" (from the initial state)
- "yellow_ball_2 is yellow" (from the initial state)

Great, we're good to go!

Actually, let me revisit the constraint again, just to be sure:
"The following expression must hold in at least one state: "green_door_2 is not locked""

This means that at some point during the execution of our plan, green_door_2 should be unlocked. Our revised plan does this, as we unlock green_door_2 in step 5. So, the constraint is satisfied.

The plan looks like this:
1. `gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_3`
2. `toggle red_door_1`
3. `gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_1`
4. `gotodoor green_door_2 room_3 room_1`
5. `toggle green_door_2`
6. `gotoobject yellow_ball_2 room_3`

I think this is a correct and efficient plan. It satisfies our goal (we're in room_3, in front of a yellow ball) and our constraint (green_door_2 is unlocked at some point).

Let's provide the final answer.

```
gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_3
toggle red_door_1
gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_1
gotodoor green_door_2 room_3 room_1
toggle green_door_2
gotoobject yellow_ball_2 room_3
```
