Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. The goal is to get a yellow ball into room_3, be in room_3, and be in front of that ball. Also, there's a constraint that at some point, green_door_2 must be unlocked. Let me start by understanding the initial state and the available actions.

So, the agent starts in room_4. The yellow balls are in room_1 (yellow_ball_1), room_3 (yellow_ball_2), and room_4 (yellow_ball_3, red_ball_2, yellow_box_1). The target is to have a yellow ball in room_3, but wait, yellow_ball_2 is already in room_3. Wait, but the goal says "there is a ball v such that v is yellow, in room_3, you are in room_3, and in front of v". So maybe we just need to be in room_3 in front of yellow_ball_2. But the initial position of the agent is in room_4, so the agent needs to move to room_3 and be in front of yellow_ball_2. However, all doors are locked initially. The doors are green_door_1 (connects room_1 and 2), green_door_2 (room_1 and 3), blue_door_1 (room_2 and 4), red_door_1 (room_3 and 4). All doors are locked.

The constraint requires that green_door_2 is unlocked at some state. So, the agent must toggle green_door_2 to unlock it. But to toggle a door, the agent must be in front of it. So how can the agent reach green_door_2? Let's see.

The agent starts in room_4. To get to green_door_2, which connects room_1 and room_3, the agent would need to go through the doors. But all doors are locked. Let's think about the possible paths.

From room_4, the agent can go to room_3 via red_door_1 or room_2 via blue_door_1. But both are locked. So first, the agent must unlock one of these doors. Let's see.

Wait, the agent is in room_4. The doors connected to room_4 are blue_door_1 (room_2 and 4) and red_door_1 (room_3 and 4). So the agent can go to the doors in room_4. But the doors are locked. So the agent can go in front of red_door_1, toggle it to unlock, then use gotoroom to go to room_3. Similarly for blue_door_1.

But to toggle a door, the agent needs to be in front of it. So first, the agent must perform "gotodoor" on red_door_1 in room_4. Let's check preconditions for "gotodoor d r1 r2": the agent must be in a room connected by door d (so since agent is in room_4, and red_door_1 connects room_4 and room_3, that's okay). Also, there must be no object blocking the position in front of the door in the current room. Are there any objects blocking doors in room_4? The initial state says yellow_box_1 is in room_4, and red_ball_2 and yellow_ball_3 are also there. But do these block the doors? The problem states that "there is no object blocking the position in front of d in the room you are currently in" is a precondition for gotodoor. So if in room_4, the position in front of red_door_1 is blocked by an object, then the agent can't go there. But the problem doesn't explicitly state where objects are positioned relative to doors. However, the initial state doesn't mention any objects blocking doors, so perhaps they are not. So the agent can go to the door.

So the steps could be:

1. Go to red_door_1 in room_4 (gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_3)
2. Toggle it to unlock.
3. Use gotoroom to go from room_4 to room_3 via red_door_1.

Once in room_3, the agent can then go to yellow_ball_2, which is already there. So then the plan could be:

But wait, the goal is to be in room_3 and in front of a yellow ball there. The yellow_ball_2 is already in room_3, so maybe the agent just needs to move there. But the agent starts in room_4. So after unlocking red_door_1 and moving to room_3, the agent can then gotoobject yellow_ball_2 in room_3.

But the constraint is that green_door_2 must be unlocked at some point. The problem is that in the current plan, the agent only toggles red_door_1. So the constraint isn't satisfied. Therefore, the agent must also toggle green_door_2.

But how can the agent get to green_door_2? Let's see. Green_door_2 connects room_1 and room_3. So to reach it, the agent needs to be in either room_1 or room_3. Once the agent is in room_3 via red_door_1, can they then go to green_door_2?

Wait, the agent is in room_3. To go to green_door_2, which connects room_1 and room_3, the agent can go to the door in room_3. So:

After reaching room_3, the agent can do gotodoor green_door_2 room_3 room_1. Then toggle it (unlock), which satisfies the constraint. But then maybe the agent doesn't need to use that door, but just toggle it. So even if the agent unlocks green_door_2, then that's sufficient for the constraint. So maybe the plan is:

1. In room_4: goto red_door_1 (gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_3)
2. Toggle red_door_1 (now unlocked)
3. Gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_1 (now in room_3)
4. Goto door green_door_2 in room_3 (gotodoor green_door_2 room_3 room_1)
5. Toggle green_door_2 (unlock it, which meets the constraint)
6. Then gotoobject yellow_ball_2 in room_3.

But wait, after step 3, the agent is in room_3. Then step 4: gotodoor green_door_2 in room_3. Then step 5: toggle, unlocking it. Then step 6: the agent is in front of green_door_2. To go to yellow_ball_2, they need to go to the object. So after step 5, they can do gotoempty to leave the door, then gotoobject yellow_ball_2.

Wait, but after step 3, when the agent moves to room_3, they are no longer in front of any object or door. So to gotoobject yellow_ball_2 in room_3, they can directly do that, provided they are in the same room. So the steps would be:

After step 3, agent is in room_3. Then:

4. gotoobject yellow_ball_2 room_3.

But then, the constraint requires that green_door_2 is unlocked at some state. So in this plan, green_door_2 remains locked. So that's a problem. So the previous idea where the agent unlocks green_door_2 is needed.

So perhaps the steps are:

1. In room_4: goto red_door_1
2. Toggle red_door_1 (unlocks)
3. Gotoroom to room_3 via red_door_1
4. Now in room_3: goto green_door_2 (which connects room_3 to room_1)
5. Toggle green_door_2 (unlock it, satisfying the constraint)
6. Now, the agent is in front of green_door_2 in room_3. Then, they can gotoobject yellow_ball_2 in room_3.

But does step 4 require that there's no object blocking the door in room_3? The problem states that initial objects are in their rooms, but doesn't mention blocking. So assuming that the agent can goto green_door_2 in room_3.

So after step 5, green_door_2 is unlocked. The agent is in front of it. Then, to get to yellow_ball_2, they need to gotoobject, which requires being in the same room. Since they are in room_3, they can do that. But after step 5, they are in front of green_door_2. So they need to first leave that position. How? Using gotoempty.

Wait, the effects of "gotoobject" state that if you were in front of something, you are no longer. So perhaps after step 5 (toggle), the agent is in front of green_door_2. Then, they can directly perform "gotoobject yellow_ball_2 room_3", which will move them to be in front of the ball. Because the preconditions for "gotoobject" are that they are in the same room as the object (they are in room_3, and the ball is in room_3). So step 6: gotoobject yellow_ball_2 room_3.

Thus, the plan would be:

1. gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_3
2. toggle red_door_1
3. gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_1
4. gotodoor green_door_2 room_3 room_1
5. toggle green_door_2
6. gotoobject yellow_ball_2 room_3

But wait, the goal requires that the agent is in room_3 and in front of a yellow ball there. After step 6, the agent is in front of yellow_ball_2 in room_3. So that meets the goal. Also, during step 5, green_door_2 is unlocked, satisfying the constraint. So this plan should work.

But let's check each action's preconditions:

Step 1: gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_3. Agent is in room_4, which is connected by red_door_1. No object blocking. Correct.

Step 2: toggle red_door_1. Agent is in front of it. Correct.

Step 3: gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_1. The door is now unlocked. Correct. Agent moves to room_3.

Step 4: gotodoor green_door_2 room_3 room_1. Agent is in room_3, which is connected via green_door_2. No blocking. Correct.

Step 5: toggle green_door_2. Agent is in front. Correct. Now door is unlocked.

Step 6: gotoobject yellow_ball_2 room_3. Agent is in same room. Correct.

This plan has 6 steps and satisfies the constraints. But wait, maybe there's a shorter plan. Let's see.

Alternative approach: can the agent use the green_door_2 to get to room_1, but that's not necessary. Since the goal is in room_3, perhaps the minimal steps are as above.

Another thing to consider: the agent could unlock green_door_2 earlier, but how? To unlock green_door_2, the agent needs to be in front of it, which requires being in room_1 or room_3. Since the agent starts in room_4, they need to get to room_3 first via red_door_1. So the steps are necessary.

So this plan should be valid. Let's verify each action's effects and preconditions again.

Another possible check: after step 3, the agent is in room_3. So step 4 is possible. Toggling green_door_2 in step 5 unlocks it, which meets the constraint. Then step 6 positions the agent in front of the ball. All conditions are met. The length is 6 steps. Is there a shorter plan?

Suppose the agent doesn't need to go to room_3. Wait, no, the goal requires the agent to be in room_3 and in front of a yellow ball. The agent starts in room_4, so must move to room_3. To get there, they need to unlock red_door_1. Then, after moving to room_3, they need to unlock green_door_2 (to meet the constraint). Then, go to the ball.

Alternatively, could the agent unlock green_door_2 first? But how? To get to green_door_2, they need to be in room_1 or room_3. The initial position is room_4. To get to room_3, unlock red_door_1. Then unlock green_door_2. So the steps are necessary.

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to unlock green_door_2 via another path. For example, from room_1. But the agent starts in room_4. To get to room_1, they would need to go through room_2 or room_3. But room_2 is connected to room_4 via blue_door_1, which is locked. So perhaps:

Unlock blue_door_1, go to room_2, unlock green_door_1 to get to room_1, then go to room_3 via green_door_2. But that seems longer. Let's count steps.

Alternative plan:

1. goto blue_door_1 in room_4
2. toggle it
3. gotoroom room_4 room_2 blue_door_1
4. goto green_door_1 in room_2
5. toggle it
6. gotoroom room_2 room_1 green_door_1
7. goto green_door_2 in room_1
8. toggle it (unlocking, meets constraint)
9. gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_2
10. gotoobject yellow_ball_2 room_3

This is 10 steps, which is longer than the previous plan of 6 steps. So the first plan is better.

Another alternative: Could the agent unlock green_door_2 without going through room_3? No, because green_door_2 connects room_1 and 3, and the agent starts in room_4. To reach green_door_2, the agent must be in room_1 or 3. The shortest path is via room_3, which requires unlocking red_door_1. So the first plan is optimal.

Another check: the constraint requires that green_door_2 is not locked at some state. In the first plan, step 5 unlocks it, so it's unlocked. Then, even if later actions lock it again, but the toggle action toggles the state. However, after step 5, the door is unlocked, so the constraint is met. So that's sufficient. The problem doesn't require it to stay unlocked, just that at some point it's unlocked.

Thus, the first plan with 6 steps is valid and optimal.
