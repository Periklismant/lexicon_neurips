Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. Hmm, the goal is to end up holding a yellow ball, but there's also a constraint that at some point I must be holding the blue_ball_1. Let me start by understanding the initial state and the available actions.

Starting in room_3. The initial state shows that the yellow_ball_1 is in room_4. But I need to get that. However, all doors are locked initially. So first, I need to unlock the doors to move between rooms. But wait, to toggle a door, I need to be in front of it, which requires going to the door. But going to a door might be blocked by objects. Let's check where the doors are.

Doors connecting rooms:
- blue_door_1 connects room_1 and room_2.
- yellow_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3.
- grey_door_1 connects room_2 and room_4.
- blue_door_2 connects room_3 and room_4.

I'm in room_3. The yellow_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3. But the doors are locked. So first, I need to get to a door, toggle it, then move through.

Wait, the initial position is room_3. So in room_3, the doors are yellow_door_1 (to room_1) and blue_door_2 (to room_4). Both are locked. To toggle them, I need to be in front of them. But are there any objects blocking those doors in room_3? Let's see. The objects in room_3 are green_box_1 and red_box_1. The problem says that "goto door" requires that there's no object blocking the position in front of d in the current room. So if the doors are not blocked, I can go to them.

Assuming that the doors in room_3 (yellow_door_1 and blue_door_2) are not blocked by objects. So first, I can go to one of those doors, toggle it to unlock, then go through.

But the goal is to hold a yellow ball. The yellow_ball_1 is in room_4. So I need to get to room_4. The path from room_3 is through blue_door_2 to room_4, but that's locked. So first, unlock blue_door_2.

Wait, but in room_3, blue_door_2 connects to room_4. So if I go to blue_door_2 in room_3, then toggle it to unlock. Then I can go to room_4 via blue_door_2. Once in room_4, I can go to the yellow_ball_1 and pick it up. But also, the constraint requires that at some point I hold blue_ball_1, which is in room_2. So how do I get to room_2?

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to collect blue_ball_1 first. Let's see. Blue_ball_1 is in room_2. So to get to room_2 from room_3, the path would be room_3 -> room_1 via yellow_door_1, then room_1 -> room_2 via blue_door_1. But both doors are locked. So that's two doors to unlock.

Alternatively, room_3 -> room_4 via blue_door_2 (unlock that), then room_4 -> room_2 via grey_door_1. But grey_door_1 is locked as well. So that's another door to unlock.

Hmm. Let's think about the steps:

Option 1: Unlock blue_door_2 from room_3. Then go to room_4. In room_4, unlock grey_door_1 (but that's in room_2 and room_4. Wait, grey_door_1 connects room_2 and room_4. So to toggle grey_door_1, I need to be in front of it in either room_2 or room_4. But if I'm in room_4, can I go to grey_door_1? Yes, if there's no object blocking. The objects in room_4 are yellow_ball_1, green_box_2, purple_ball_1. So if none of them are blocking the door, then I can go to the door, toggle it, then go to room_2. Once in room_2, pick up blue_ball_1 (which satisfies the constraint), then proceed to room_4 again to get the yellow_ball_1.

But how to get from room_4 to room_2 via grey_door_1. Let me outline the steps:

1. From room_3, go to blue_door_2 (room_3 and room_4), toggle it (unlock).
2. Go through blue_door_2 to room_4.
3. Now in room_4. Need to get to grey_door_1. So go to grey_door_1 in room_4 (assuming no blocking), toggle to unlock.
4. Then go to room_2 via grey_door_1.
5. In room_2, pick up blue_ball_1 (satisfy the constraint).
6. Then go back to room_4 via grey_door_1 (already unlocked).
7. In room_4, go to yellow_ball_1, pick it up.

But wait, the initial step is room_3. Let's check if that's possible.

But first, to go to blue_door_2 from room_3:

Action: gotodoor blue_door_2 room_3 room_4. Preconditions: in the same room as the door (yes, in room_3), and no object blocking. Since room_3 has green_box_1 and red_box_1. Are they blocking the door? The problem statement doesn't mention any objects blocking doors in the initial state, so assuming that doors are not blocked. So that's allowed. So gotodoor blue_door_2 room_3 room_4. Then toggle it (unlock). Then gotoroom room_3 room_4 blue_door_2. Now in room_4.

In room_4, need to unlock grey_door_1. So gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_2. Toggle to unlock. Then gotoroom room_4 room_2 grey_door_1. Now in room_2. Then gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_2, pick it up (satisfy constraint). Then drop it? Or carry it?

Wait, the goal is to be holding a yellow ball. So after picking up blue_ball_1, we need to eventually drop it to pick up the yellow one. But the constraint is just that at some point we held blue_ball_1, which is satisfied once we pick it up. So after that, we can drop it if needed.

But the problem is, after picking up blue_ball_1, to pick up the yellow_ball_1, we need to go to room_4 again, which requires moving back through grey_door_1 (unlocked now). Then in room_4, go to yellow_ball_1 and pick it up.

But wait, when you pick up an object, you have to drop it to pick another. So steps:

In room_2:

- gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_2
- pick blue_ball_1 room_2 (now holding it, constraint met)
- then drop it? Or carry it. But to pick yellow_ball_1, we need to be in room_4 and not holding anything.

So perhaps after picking blue_ball_1 in room_2, drop it, then proceed.

But that adds steps. Alternatively, carry it to room_4, then drop it there, then pick up yellow_ball_1. Let's see.

But the goal is to hold a yellow ball (yellow_ball_1) in the final state. So after dropping blue_ball_1, you can pick up the yellow one.

So the steps would be:

After picking blue_ball_1 in room_2:

- gotoempty (to drop)
- drop blue_ball_1 room_2 (but then you're in front of it again). Or maybe gotodoor or something else.

Alternatively, after picking blue_ball_1, go back to room_4 via grey_door_1 (since it's unlocked). In room_4, drop blue_ball_1, then pick up yellow_ball_1.

But that requires:

From room_2:

- gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_4
- toggle it (already unlocked)
- gotoroom room_2 room_4 grey_door_1 (now in room_4)
- gotoempty (to drop)
- drop blue_ball_1 room_4
- then gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_4
- pick yellow_ball_1 room_4

But that seems possible. Let's check the steps:

1. Start in room_3.
2. gotodoor blue_door_2 room_3 room_4
3. toggle blue_door_2
4. gotoroom room_3 room_4 blue_door_2
5. Now in room_4. Then gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_2
6. toggle grey_door_1
7. gotoroom room_4 room_2 grey_door_1
8. Now in room_2. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_2
9. pick blue_ball_1 room_2 (constraint met)
10. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_4
11. toggle grey_door_1 (but it's already unlocked, so toggling would lock it again. Wait, no. Toggling changes the state. So if it's unlocked, toggle locks it. But we need to go back to room_4. So after step 7, when we go to room_2, we leave grey_door_1 unlocked. Then in step 10, gotodoor grey_door_1 in room_2, then step 11 toggle it again? That would lock it. Oh wait, but after unlocking it in step 6, it's unlocked. So when we go back through in step 7 (wait, step 7 is gotoroom from room_4 to room_2 via grey_door_1. Then after that, in step 10, gotodoor grey_door_1 in room_2. Then step 11 toggle would lock it again. But that's a problem. Because then when we try to go back to room_4, the door would be locked again.

Wait, no. Let me retrace:

After step 6: toggle grey_door_1 (unlocked it). Then step7: gotoroom room_4 to room_2 via grey_door_1. So after step7, the door is still unlocked. Then when we are in room_2, to go back to room_4, we need to use grey_door_1 again. But if we don't toggle it again, it's still unlocked. Wait, but after step6, it's unlocked. So when we are in room_2, to go back to room_4 via grey_door_1, the door is already unlocked. So steps:

After step7: in room_2. Then steps 8 and 9: pick blue_ball_1. Then step10: gotodoor grey_door_1 in room_2 (since the door connects room_2 and room_4). Then step11: gotoroom room_2 room_4 grey_door_1. Wait, but for gotoroom, the door must be unlocked. Since we left it unlocked, we don't need to toggle again. Wait, no: the gotoroom action requires that the door is unlocked. So if the door is already unlocked, we can just go through.

So after step7 (in room_2), steps:

8. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_2
9. pick blue_ball_1 room_2
10. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_4
11. gotoroom room_2 room_4 grey_door_1 (door is unlocked)
12. Now in room_4. Then drop blue_ball_1 (need to be in front of empty spot)
13. gotoempty in room_4
14. drop blue_ball_1 room_4
15. gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_4
16. pick yellow_ball_1 room_4

This way, the door remains unlocked, so steps 10 and 11 don't require toggling again. So that's better.

But wait, the gotoroom action requires that the door is unlocked. Since after step6, we toggled grey_door_1 (unlocked it), and then went through. So it's still unlocked. So when returning, no need to toggle again.

So let's adjust the steps:

1. In room_3, go to blue_door_2 (gotodoor blue_door_2 room_3 room_4)
2. Toggle blue_door_2 (unlocks it)
3. Gotoroom room_3 room_4 blue_door_2 (now in room4)
4. Go to grey_door_1 in room4 (gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_2)
5. Toggle grey_door_1 (unlocks it)
6. Gotoroom room_4 room_2 grey_door_1 (now in room2)
7. Gotoobject blue_ball_1 room2
8. Pick blue_ball_1 room2 (constraint satisfied)
9. Gotoempty (in room2) to drop? Wait, no. To return to room4, we need to use grey_door_1 again. So:

After step8, we're holding blue_ball_1. Then:

9. gotodoor grey_door_1 room2 room4 (since we're in room2)
10. gotoroom room2 room4 grey_door_1 (door is unlocked)
11. Now in room4. Gotoempty
12. drop blue_ball_1 room4 (so we can pick up yellow_ball_1)
13. gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room4
14. pick yellow_ball_1 room4

This would achieve the goal. Let's count the steps. But wait, after step5, the grey_door_1 is unlocked. So steps 6 and 10 can be done without toggling again. So the plan would be:

Actions:

1. gotodoor blue_door_2 room_3 room_4
2. toggle blue_door_2
3. gotoroom room_3 room_4 blue_door_2
4. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_2
5. toggle grey_door_1
6. gotoroom room_4 room_2 grey_door_1
7. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_2
8. pick blue_ball_1 room_2
9. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_4
10. gotoroom room_2 room_4 grey_door_1
11. gotoempty
12. drop blue_ball_1 room_4
13. gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_4
14. pick yellow_ball_1 room_4

This plan has 14 steps. But maybe there's a shorter way. Let's see.

Alternative approach: From room3, can I go to room4 via blue_door_2 (unlock), then in room4, go to yellow_ball_1 directly? But the constraint requires holding blue_ball_1. So unless I can get to room2, pick up blue_ball_1, then come back. But how?

Alternatively, is there a way to get to room2 from room3 through other doors? Let's see. From room3, the doors are yellow_door_1 (to room1) and blue_door_2 (to room4). So to reach room2, perhaps via room1: room3 -> room1 (unlock yellow_door_1), then room1 -> room2 (unlock blue_door_1). But that would require unlocking two doors.

Compare the two paths:

Option1: Unlock blue_door_2 and grey_door_1 (2 doors)
Option2: Unlock yellow_door_1 and blue_door_1 (2 doors)

Either way, two doors to unlock. So which path is shorter?

In the first option, steps are:

Unlock blue_door_2 (room3)
Go to room4
Unlock grey_door_1 (room4)
Go to room2
Pick blue_ball_1
Go back to room4
Drop
Pick yellow_ball_1

That's 14 steps as before.

In the second option:

From room3, unlock yellow_door_1:

1. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1
2. toggle yellow_door_1
3. gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_1
4. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2
5. toggle blue_door_1
6. gotoroom room_1 room_2 blue_door_1
7. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_2
8. pick blue_ball_1 room_2
9. Then need to go to room4. But how? From room2, unlock grey_door_1 (room2 to room4)
10. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room4
11. toggle grey_door_1
12. gotoroom room_2 room4 grey_door_1
13. gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room4
14. drop blue_ball_1 (if needed)
15. pick yellow_ball_1

This seems longer. So perhaps the first option is shorter.

But maybe there's a way to optimize. Let me think.

Wait, in the first plan, after unlocking blue_door_2 and grey_door_1, moving back and forth. But perhaps after step5 (toggle grey_door_1 in room4), gotoroom to room2. Then pick blue_ball_1. Then return to room4 via grey_door_1. Then drop, then pick yellow.

But the steps are necessary. Let me count the steps again for the first plan:

1. gotodoor blue_door_2 room_3 room_4
2. toggle blue_door_2
3. gotoroom room_3 room_4 blue_door_2
4. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_2
5. toggle grey_door_1
6. gotoroom room_4 room_2 grey_door_1
7. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_2
8. pick blue_ball_1 room_2
9. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_4
10. gotoroom room_2 room_4 grey_door_1
11. gotoempty room_4
12. drop blue_ball_1 room_4
13. gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_4
14. pick yellow_ball_1 room_4

That's 14 steps. But maybe some steps can be skipped. For example, after step10, when you're in room4, can you directly go to yellow_ball_1 without dropping blue_ball_1 first? But you can't pick up another object while holding one. So you need to drop the blue_ball_1 first. So steps 11-14 are necessary.

Is there a shorter path? Let's see. Suppose after step8, instead of going back to room4, maybe go through another door. But how? The blue_ball_1 is in room2. So to get the yellow_ball_1 in room4, you have to get there.

Another idea: After picking up blue_ball_1, instead of returning to room4, perhaps go through room2 to room4 via grey_door_1 (which is unlocked), then drop blue_ball_1 in room4, then pick yellow_ball_1. But that's what the original plan does.

Alternatively, after step6 (in room2), can I goto yellow_ball_1? No, because yellow_ball_1 is in room4.

Another thought: When you're in room4 after step3, you have to unlock grey_door_1 to get to room2. But is there a way to reach room4's yellow_ball_1 without going to room2? No, because the constraint requires holding blue_ball_1. So you have to go to room2.

So I think the initial plan is the minimal steps. Let's check if all preconditions are met.

Step1: gotodoor blue_door_2 room3 room4. Pre: in room3 (yes), door connects room3 and room4 (yes). No object blocking in room3 (assumed yes). So allowed.

Step2: toggle blue_door_2. Pre: in front of it (yes, after step1). So allowed.

Step3: gotoroom room3 to room4 via blue_door_2. Pre: door unlocked (yes after step2). So allowed.

Step4: gotodoor grey_door_1 room4 room2. Pre: in room4 (yes), door connects room4 and room2 (yes). No object blocking in room4 (assuming yes). So allowed.

Step5: toggle grey_door_1. Pre: in front of it (yes after step4). So allowed.

Step6: gotoroom room4 to room2 via grey_door_1. Pre: door unlocked (yes after step5). Allowed.

Step7: gotoobject blue_ball_1 room2. Pre: in same room (yes). Allowed.

Step8: pick blue_ball_1. Pre: in same room, not holding anything (yes). Allowed.

Step9: gotodoor grey_door_1 room2 room4. Pre: in room2, door connects room2 and room4 (yes). No blocking objects. Allowed.

Step10: gotoroom room2 to room4 via grey_door_1. Pre: door unlocked (yes). Allowed.

Step11: gotoempty in room4. Pre: always allowed.

Step12: drop blue_ball_1. Pre: holding it and in front of empty spot (after step11). Allowed.

Step13: gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room4. Pre: in room4. Allowed.

Step14: pick yellow_ball_1. Pre: not holding anything (yes, after drop). Allowed.

Yes, all steps are valid. So this plan meets the goal and the constraint.

But wait, after step12, when you drop blue_ball_1, you are in front of it. Then step13 is gotoobject yellow_ball_1, which would require moving away from blue_ball_1. So after dropping, you're in front of blue_ball_1. So to gotoobject yellow_ball_1, you need to leave that spot.

Wait, the effect of drop is that you are in front of x (the dropped object). So after step12 (drop blue_ball_1), you're in front of it. So step13: gotoobject yellow_ball_1. But that requires that you are in the same room (yes, room4). But to gotoobject, you need to move from your current position (in front of blue_ball_1) to in front of yellow_ball_1. So the action is allowed.

Thus, step13 is valid. Then step14: pick yellow_ball_1. Since you're not holding anything (after dropping blue_ball_1), and in front of it. So allowed.

This plan works. Let me count the steps again. 14 actions. Is there a way to shorten this?

For example, after step10 (in room4), instead of gotoempty and drop, maybe we can drop immediately. Wait, when you gotoroom, you are no longer in front of anything. Because the effect of gotoroom is that you are no longer in front of any object or door. So after step10 (gotoroom from room2 to room4), you're in room4 and not in front of anything. So step11: gotoempty is necessary to get to an empty spot to drop. Because drop requires that the position in front is empty. Wait, no: the drop action requires that the position in front of you is empty. So after gotoroom, you're not in front of anything. So when you do drop x, you need to be in front of an empty spot. But after gotoroom, you're not in front of anything. So where are you? The gotoempty action is required to position yourself in front of an empty spot before dropping.

Alternatively, after step10 (in room4, not in front of anything), perhaps you can directly drop. But the drop action's precondition is that you are in front of an empty spot. Since after gotoroom, you're not in front of anything. So you can't drop unless you are in front of an empty spot. So you have to do gotoempty first.

Thus, steps 11 and 12 are necessary.

Alternatively, after step10, could you gotoobject yellow_ball_1 directly, but that requires being in the same room. But then you're in front of it, and you can drop blue_ball_1 there? No, because you need to drop in an empty spot. So you have to gotoempty first.

So the plan is as minimal as possible. I think this is the optimal plan.
