Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. So, the goal is to have a yellow ball that the agent is holding. The initial state has the agent in room_3, and there's a yellow_ball_1 in room_4. But all the doors are locked initially. So the agent needs to navigate through the rooms, unlock doors, pick up the yellow ball.

First, I need to figure out the path from room_3 to room_4. Looking at the doors, room_3 and room_4 are connected via blue_door_2. But blue_door_2 is locked. So the agent needs to unlock it. To toggle a door, the agent must be in front of it. But before that, the agent has to go to the door. But to go to the door, the agent must be in a room connected by that door. Since the agent starts in room_3, blue_door_2 connects room_3 and room_4. So, the agent can go to blue_door_2 from room_3. But to get in front of the door, there must be no object blocking it. Wait, the preconditions for "gotodoor d r1 r2" require that there's no object blocking the position in front of d in the current room. So in room_3, are there any objects blocking blue_door_2? The initial state says room_3 has green_box_1 and red_box_1. But do boxes block doors? The problem mentions that when you pick up an object, if it was blocking a door, it's no longer blocking. So maybe the boxes are in front of doors? Wait, the initial state doesn't specify positions of objects relative to doors. Hmm. The problem states that "goto door" requires that there's no object blocking the position in front of d. So unless the initial state mentions that an object is blocking a door, we can assume they're not. But since the initial state doesn't mention any blocking, maybe the doors aren't blocked. So the agent can go to blue_door_2 from room_3.

So steps would be:

1. From room_3, go to blue_door_2 (gotodoor blue_door_2 room_3 room_4)
2. Toggle it to unlock (since it's initially locked)
3. Then go from room_3 to room_4 via blue_door_2 (gotoroom room_3 room_4 blue_door_2)
4. Now in room_4, find the yellow_ball_1. It's in room_4 according to the initial state.
5. Go to the yellow_ball_1 (gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_4)
6. Pick it up (pick yellow_ball_1 room_4)

But wait, the agent needs to be in the same room as the object to gotoobject. Since after moving to room_4, the agent is there, so step 5 is possible. Then pick, which requires not holding anything, which is true after dropping any objects, but initially the agent isn't holding anything.

Wait, but the doors are all locked initially. So the initial step is to unlock blue_door_2. But to toggle it, the agent must be in front of it. So steps:

Current room: room_3.

Action 1: gotodoor blue_door_2 room_3 room_4. Preconditions: in a room connected by the door (yes, room_3), and no object blocking. Assuming no blocking, so this is allowed.

Action 2: toggle blue_door_2. Now it's unlocked.

Action 3: gotoroom room_3 room_4 blue_door_2. Now in room_4.

Then, in room_4, go to the yellow_ball_1. But the agent is in room_4, and the ball is there.

Action 4: gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_4.

Action 5: pick yellow_ball_1 room_4. Now holding it. That's the goal.

Wait, but the initial state says the yellow_ball_1 is in room_4. So that's correct. So the plan would be those five actions. But let me check for any constraints or other issues.

Wait, the constraints weren't provided in the problem statement. The user mentioned "a set of constraints" but the actual problem doesn't list any. Wait, looking back: the original problem says "A valid plan for the abovementioned problem must abide by the following constraints:" but then there's nothing. Maybe that's a formatting error. But assuming there are no additional constraints beyond the preconditions, the plan should work.

But wait, when the agent is in room_3, after toggling blue_door_2 (unlocking it), they can then go through to room_4. Then, in room_4, they can go to the yellow_ball_1 and pick it up. That seems correct.

So the steps are:

1. gotodoor blue_door_2 room_3 room_4
2. toggle blue_door_2
3. gotoroom room_3 room_4 blue_door_2
4. gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_4
5. pick yellow_ball_1 room_4

That's five actions. Is there a shorter plan? Let's see. The agent starts in room_3. The yellow_ball_1 is in room_4. The only door connecting room_3 to room_4 is blue_door_2, which is locked. So unlocking it is necessary. Then moving to room_4. So the steps are necessary. Therefore, this is the optimal plan.
