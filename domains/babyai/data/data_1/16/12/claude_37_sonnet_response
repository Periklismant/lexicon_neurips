Let me understand the problem:

1. I'm in a 2D gridworld with 4 rooms arranged in a square formation.
2. There are objects (boxes and balls) and doors, each with a color.
3. My task is to find a sequence of actions to satisfy a goal while following constraints.

### Initial state:
- I am in room_4.
- Various objects (balls and boxes) are distributed in the rooms.
- All doors are locked.
- I haven't visited any rooms except room_4.

### Goal:
- There is a blue door that connects room_1 and room_2.
- I am in front of this door.
- The door is not locked.

### Constraint:
- I cannot be in room_2 at any point in the plan.

Let's reason through this:

Based on the given initial state, there's a blue door named "blue_door_1" that connects room_1 and room_2. To achieve the goal, I need to:
1. Get to room_1 (since I can't be in room_2 due to the constraint).
2. Unlock blue_door_1.
3. Position myself in front of blue_door_1 in room_1.

Let's identify a path to get to room_1 from room_4:
- I'm in room_4.
- I can potentially go to room_2 or room_3 from room_4 using purple_door_1 or blue_door_2 respectively.
- But, due to the constraint, I can't be in room_2.
- So, I need to go to room_3 from room_4 using blue_door_2.
- From room_3, I can go to room_1 using red_door_1.

But all doors are locked, so I need to unlock them as I go.

So, my plan would be:
1. Go to blue_door_2 in room_4.
2. Unlock blue_door_2.
3. Go to room_3 using blue_door_2.
4. Go to red_door_1 in room_3.
5. Unlock red_door_1.
6. Go to room_1 using red_door_1.
7. Go to blue_door_1 in room_1.
8. Unlock blue_door_1.

Let's trace through this to ensure it works, ensuring I follow the action preconditions and effects:

1. I am in room_4. I need to go to blue_door_2.
   Action: `gotodoor blue_door_2 room_4 room_3`
   Now I'm in front of blue_door_2 in room_4.

2. I need to unlock blue_door_2.
   Action: `toggle blue_door_2`
   Now blue_door_2 is unlocked.

3. I need to go from room_4 to room_3 using blue_door_2.
   Action: `gotoroom room_4 room_3 blue_door_2`
   Now I'm in room_3, but not in front of anything in particular.

4. I need to go in front of red_door_1 in room_3.
   Action: `gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1`
   Now I'm in front of red_door_1 in room_3.

5. I need to unlock red_door_1.
   Action: `toggle red_door_1`
   Now red_door_1 is unlocked.

6. I need to go from room_3 to room_1 using red_door_1.
   Action: `gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1`
   Now I'm in room_1, but not in front of anything in particular.

7. I need to go in front of blue_door_1 in room_1.
   Action: `gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2`
   Now I'm in front of blue_door_1 in room_1.

8. I need to unlock blue_door_1.
   Action: `toggle blue_door_1`
   Now blue_door_1 is unlocked.

From the initial state, I'm in room_4 and I've only visited room_4. After the plan, I'm in room_1, in front of blue_door_1, which is unlocked. This satisfies the goal.

However, I need to make sure I haven't violated the constraint of not being in room_2 at any point. Let's check: I went from room_4 to room_3 to room_1, and never entered room_2. So, the constraint is satisfied.

Let's double-check that the plan satisfies the goal:
- There is a blue door (blue_door_1) that connects room_1 and room_2.
- I am in front of blue_door_1.
- blue_door_1 is not locked.

Yep, the goal is satisfied.

Here's the final plan:
```
gotodoor blue_door_2 room_4 room_3
toggle blue_door_2
gotoroom room_4 room_3 blue_door_2
gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1
toggle red_door_1
gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1
gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2
toggle blue_door_1
```

Actually, I just realized I might have missed something. Let me review the actions and their preconditions again:

"goto door": you may only go in front of a door d if (i) you are in a room which door d is connecting with another room, and (ii) there is no object blocking the position in front of d in the room you are currently in.

Ok, so I need to check if there are any objects blocking the doors. From the initial state, it doesn't directly indicate any objects blocking doors. So I'll assume there are no blockages. (If objects can block doors, there should be specific statements in the initial state like "object X is blocking door Y").

Let's also check if any of the actions might have missed something:

"goto object": you may only go in front of an object x if you are in the same room as x.
"goto empty": you may go in front of an empty position anytime.
"goto door": you may only go in front of a door d if (i) you are in a room which door d is connecting with another room, and (ii) there is no object blocking the position in front of d in the room you are currently in.
"goto room": you may only go in a room r if (i) you are currently in a room r0 that is adjacent to r, and (ii) the door that is connecting r0 and r is unlocked.
"pick": you may only pick up an object x if (i) you are in the same room as x, and (ii) you are currently not holding any object.
"drop": you may only drop an object x if (i) you are currently holding x, and (ii) the position in front of you is empty.
"toggle": you may only toggle a door d if you are in front of d.

I believe the plan properly adheres to these preconditions. The gotodoor actions verify I'm in the correct room. The toggle actions verify I'm in front of the door I want to toggle. And the gotoroom actions verify that I'm in a room adjacent to the target room and the door connecting them is unlocked.

One more check: Are there any effects that might change the plan? No, the effects all align with our expectations: we update where we are, what we're in front of, and the state of the doors as we toggle them.

So, I believe the plan I've outlined is correct and optimal.

```
gotodoor blue_door_2 room_4 room_3
toggle blue_door_2
gotoroom room_4 room_3 blue_door_2
gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1
toggle red_door_1
gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1
gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2
toggle blue_door_1
```

Actually, I was thinking about something: If all doors are locked, how do I navigate? All doors have to be unlocked in order for an agent to move through them. The toggle action is used to switch the door state (from locked to unlocked, or vice versa). I need to be in front of a door to toggle it.

I was assuming that I start in a room and can move to doors in that room, even if they're locked. Then I'd toggle (unlock) them and move through. But I should think through the full action process to make sure.

Actually, reading the problem statement again, I think my initial understanding is correct:

1. "gotodoor" is going in front of a door in a room I'm currently in.
2. "toggle" is unlocking or locking a door I'm in front of.
3. "gotoroom" is moving from one room to another via an unlocked door.

So my plan should work as outlined.

Let's verify again:

1. I am in room_4. I need to go in front of blue_door_2.
   Action: `gotodoor blue_door_2 room_4 room_3`
   Now I'm in front of blue_door_2 in room_4. (I can go in front of a door as long as I'm in a room that's connected to it).

2. I need to unlock blue_door_2.
   Action: `toggle blue_door_2`
   Now blue_door_2 is unlocked. (I can toggle a door as long as I'm in front of it).

3. I need to go from room_4 to room_3 using blue_door_2.
   Action: `gotoroom room_4 room_3 blue_door_2`
   Now I'm in room_3. (I can go through a door as long as it's unlocked).

4. I need to go in front of red_door_1 in room_3.
   Action: `gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1`
   Now I'm in front of red_door_1 in room_3.

5. I need to unlock red_door_1.
   Action: `toggle red_door_1`
   Now red_door_1 is unlocked.

6. I need to go from room_3 to room_1 using red_door_1.
   Action: `gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1`
   Now I'm in room_1.

7. I need to go in front of blue_door_1 in room_1.
   Action: `gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2`
   Now I'm in front of blue_door_1 in room_1.

8. I need to unlock blue_door_1.
   Action: `toggle blue_door_1`
   Now blue_door_1 is unlocked.

Alright, this plan should work. Let's check again if it satisfies the goal and constraint:

- Goal: There's a blue door (blue_door_1) connecting room_1 and room_2, I'm in front of it, and it's unlocked. ✓
- Constraint: I'm never in room_2. ✓

I believe my plan is correct and optimal. It's correct because it meets the goal without violating the constraint, and it's optimal because it's the shortest path to achieve the goal without visiting room_2.

```
gotodoor blue_door_2 room_4 room_3
toggle blue_door_2
gotoroom room_4 room_3 blue_door_2
gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1
toggle red_door_1
gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1
gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2
toggle blue_door_1
```

Actually, I just reread the preconditions for the `gotodoor` action, and I see another check: "there is no object blocking the position in front of d in the room you are currently in."

Looking at the initial state, I don't see any explicit statements about objects blocking doors. There might be implicit statements, but from the problem description, it's unclear. Without further information, I'd assume there are no blocked doors in the initial state.

So, my plan should be valid:

```
gotodoor blue_door_2 room_4 room_3
toggle blue_door_2
gotoroom room_4 room_3 blue_door_2
gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1
toggle red_door_1
gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1
gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2
toggle blue_door_1
```

Finally, a small note on the format of the answer. I've been writing the names of the actions as `actionName` (camelCase), but upon reviewing the problem, the action names are consistently lowercase with spaces between words: `goto door`, `goto empty`, etc. Let me check the exact names in the problem statement...

Actually, looking back at how the actions are defined, they're written without spaces: "gotoobject", "gotoempty", "gotodoor", etc. So, I'll use these formats.

Also, let me double check the parameters of these actions based on the problem description:

- "gotoobject x r": Go in front of to object x in room r.
- "gotoempty": Go in front of an empty position of the room, which does not contain any object.
- "gotodoor d r1 r2": Go in front of door d, connecting room r1 to room r2.
- "gotoroom r1 r2 d": Go to room r2 from room r1 using door d.
- "pick x r": Pick up object x in room r.
- "drop x r": Drop object x in room r.
- "toggle d": Unlock door d if is locked. Lock door d if is unlocked.

Alright, so the correct format for my plan would be:

```
gotodoor blue_door_2 room_4 room_3
toggle blue_door_2
gotoroom room_4 room_3 blue_door_2
gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1
toggle red_door_1
gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1
gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2
toggle blue_door_1
```

This should be the final, correct, and optimal plan.

```
gotodoor blue_door_2 room_4 room_3
toggle blue_door_2
gotoroom room_4 room_3 blue_door_2
gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1
toggle red_door_1
gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1
gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2
toggle blue_door_1
```

This plan is 8 steps long.

Let's verify that there isn't a shorter plan. To achieve the goal, we need to:
1. Be in room_1 (not room_2 due to constraint).
2. Be in front of blue_door_1.
3. Have blue_door_1 unlocked.

The only way to get to room_1 from room_4 (given the constraint that I can't be in room_2) is via room_3. This requires:
- Unlocking blue_door_2 (between room_4 and room_3): 2 steps
- Going to room_3: 1 step
- Unlocking red_door_1 (between room_3 and room_1): 2 steps
- Going to room_1: 1 step
- Going in front of blue_door_1 in room_1: 1 step
- Unlocking blue_door_1: 1 step

That's a total of 8 steps, which matches my plan. Since we can't skip any of these steps, 8 is indeed the optimal plan length. So, the plan I've outlined is correct and optimal.

```
gotodoor blue_door_2 room_4 room_3
toggle blue_door_2
gotoroom room_4 room_3 blue_door_2
gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1
toggle red_door_1
gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1
gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2
toggle blue_door_1
```
