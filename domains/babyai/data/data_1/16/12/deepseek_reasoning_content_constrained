Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. Hmm, the goal is to have a blue door connecting room_1 and room_2, not locked, and I need to be in front of it. Also, I must never enter room_2. Let's see.

First, initial state: I'm in room_4. All doors are locked. The doors connecting room_1 and room_2 are blue_door_1. So that's the d we need. But blue_door_1 is locked initially, and I need it unlocked. So I need to unlock it. But how do I get there without violating constraints?

Wait, I can't go into room_2. So the path to blue_door_1 must avoid room_2. Let's check the connections. Room_1 is connected to room_2 via blue_door_1, and to room_3 via red_door_1. Room_3 is connected to room_4 via blue_door_2. Room_4 is connected to room_2 via purple_door_1, but we can't go there.

So starting in room_4, maybe I can go to room_3 via blue_door_2. But that door is locked. So I need to unlock blue_door_2 first. But how? To toggle a door, I need to be in front of it. So in room_4, blue_door_2 connects to room_3. So I can go to the door in room_4, toggle it to unlock, then go through to room_3.

Wait, initial doors are all locked. So in room_4, the doors are purple_door_1 (connecting to room_2, which we can't go to) and blue_door_2 (connecting to room_3). So I can go to blue_door_2 in room_4. Let's see:

First, go to blue_door_2 from room_4. But to do that, I need to be in a room connected by that door. So room_4 is connected to room_3 via blue_door_2. So "gotodoor blue_door_2 room_4 room_3". Precondition: I'm in a room connected by the door (yes, room_4), and no object is blocking the position. The initial objects in room_4 are yellow_box_3. So is yellow_box_3 blocking the door? The problem statement doesn't mention objects blocking doors unless they're in front. But the initial state doesn't say any objects are blocking doors. So maybe it's okay. So I can "gotodoor blue_door_2 room_4 room_3". Then toggle it to unlock. Then go to room_3 via gotoroom room_4 room_3 blue_door_2.

Once in room_3, I can go to red_door_1 which connects room_1 and room_3. But red_door_1 is locked. So need to unlock it. But first, I need to go in front of it. So in room_3, the doors are red_door_1 (connecting to room_1) and blue_door_2 (connecting to room_4). So to reach red_door_1, I need to be in room_3. So "gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1", then toggle it. Then go through red_door_1 to room_1.

Once in room_1, I can go to blue_door_1 (connecting room_1 and room_2). But I need to unlock that door. So in room_1, the doors are blue_door_1 (to room_2) and red_door_1 (to room_3). But blue_door_1 is in room_1. So "gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2", then toggle it to unlock. Then the door is unlocked, and I need to be in front of it. Then the goal is achieved.

So let's outline the steps:

1. From room_4, go to blue_door_2 (room_4 to room_3). But first, check if any objects are blocking. Since yellow_box_3 is in room_4, but the problem doesn't state it's blocking a door. So assuming it's not, proceed.

Action: gotodoor blue_door_2 room_4 room_3

2. Toggle blue_door_2 to unlock.

Action: toggle blue_door_2

3. Go to room_3 through blue_door_2.

Action: gotoroom room_4 room_3 blue_door_2

4. Now in room_3, go to red_door_1 (room_3 to room_1).

Action: gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1

5. Toggle red_door_1 to unlock.

Action: toggle red_door_1

6. Go through red_door_1 to room_1.

Action: gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1

7. Now in room_1, go to blue_door_1 (room_1 to room_2).

Action: gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2

8. Toggle blue_door_1 to unlock.

Action: toggle blue_door_1

Now, blue_door_1 is unlocked, and I'm in front of it. The goal requires that d is blue, connects room_1 and room_2, I'm in front of it, and it's unlocked. This satisfies all. Also, never entered room_2. So the constraints are met.

Wait, but steps 7 and 8: after step 6, I'm in room_1. Then gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2. Then toggle. That's correct. So the plan is:

```
gotodoor blue_door_2 room_4 room_3
toggle blue_door_2
gotoroom room_4 room_3 blue_door_2
gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1
toggle red_door_1
gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1
gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2
toggle blue_door_1
```

Check each action's preconditions:

1. gotodoor blue_door_2 room_4 room_3: in room_4 (yes), door connects room_4 and room3, and no blocking object (assuming yes). Possible.

2. toggle blue_door_2: must be in front of it. After action 1, yes.

3. gotoroom room_4 to room3 via blue_door2: door is now unlocked. Correct.

4. gotodoor red_door_1 in room3: yes, in room3. Door connects to room1. No blocking object (since initial objects in room3 are blue_ball_1, yellow_box_2, and grey_ball_3. Are any of them blocking the door? The problem doesn't state that, so assuming not.

5. toggle red_door_1: now in front of it.

6. gotoroom to room1 via red_door_1: unlocked now.

7. gotodoor blue_door_1 in room1: yes.

8. toggle it: now unlocked.

This plan should work. Let's check constraints: never entered room2. All movements are room4->3->1. Correct. So this should be the optimal plan.
