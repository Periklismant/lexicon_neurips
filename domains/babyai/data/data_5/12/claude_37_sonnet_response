Let's analyze the problem:

1. We're in a 2D gridworld with 4 rooms arranged in a square: 
   - room_1 (north-west)
   - room_2 (south-west)
   - room_3 (north-east)
   - room_4 (south-east)

2. The rooms are connected by doors:
   - purple_door_1 connects room_1 and room_2
   - yellow_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3
   - red_door_1 connects room_2 and room_4
   - purple_door_2 connects room_3 and room_4

3. The goal is to bring about:
   - There is a door d such that "The following conditions are all true: "d is yellow", "you are in front of d", "d is not locked""
   - In other words, we need to find a yellow door, go in front of it, and make sure it's unlocked.

4. Initial state:
   - We are in room_4.
   - Various objects (boxes and balls) are distributed in different rooms.
   - All doors are locked.

5. Constraints:
   - We need to be in room_4 at some point.
   - If we are in room_4, then we must be in front of purple_door_1 at that time or later.
   - We need to be in front of purple_door_2 at some point.
   - Before we can be in front of purple_door_2, either green_box_2 must be in room_2 or we must be holding green_box_1.
   - purple_door_2 must be locked at some point.
   - If purple_door_2 is locked, then we must be holding an object at that time or later.
   - purple_door_2 must be unlocked at some point.
   - Before purple_door_2 can be unlocked, either green_box_2 must be in room_1 or we must be in room_3.
   - We need to be in front of yellow_door_1 at some point.
   - Before we can be in front of yellow_door_1, either we must be in room_2 or we must be holding green_box_2.

Now, let's start solving this problem. 

The goal is to be in front of yellow_door_1 and it should be unlocked.

From the initial state, we are in room_4. The doors that we have access to are red_door_1 and purple_door_2, which connect to room_2 and room_3 respectively. However, both doors are locked.

Now, according to the constraints, we need to be in front of purple_door_2 at some point, but before that either green_box_2 must be in room_2 or we must be holding green_box_1.

green_box_2 is initially in room_4, and green_box_1 is in room_1. Since we start in room_4, it might be easier to pick up green_box_2 and move it to room_2.

But to move green_box_2 to room_2, we need to go through red_door_1, which is locked. So we need to unlock it first.

Let's make a plan:

1. First, let's go to red_door_1: gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2
2. Toggle red_door_1 to unlock it: toggle red_door_1
3. Go to green_box_2: gotoobject green_box_2 room_4
4. Pick up green_box_2: pick green_box_2 room_4
5. Go to red_door_1 again: gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2
6. Go to room_2 using red_door_1: gotoroom room_4 room_2 red_door_1
7. Drop green_box_2 in room_2: drop green_box_2 room_2

Now, green_box_2 is in room_2, so we've satisfied the condition to be in front of purple_door_2. But we also need to be in front of purple_door_1 (since we're in room_4 at the start). 

From room_2, we can go to room_1 through purple_door_1, but it's locked. Let's unlock it.

8. Go to purple_door_1: gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1
9. Toggle purple_door_1 to unlock it: toggle purple_door_1
10. Go to room_1 through purple_door_1: gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1

Now, we're in room_1. From here, we can see yellow_door_1, which connects room_1 and room_3. This is the door we need to unlock based on the goal.

However, the constraints say that before we can be in front of yellow_door_1, either we must be in room_2 or we must be holding green_box_2. We've just been in room_2, so we're good.

11. Go to yellow_door_1: gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3
12. Toggle yellow_door_1 to unlock it: toggle yellow_door_1

At this point, we've satisfied the goal of being in front of yellow_door_1 and having it unlocked.

But let's check if we've satisfied all the constraints:

- We've been in room_4 (initial state).
- But if we're in room_4, we need to be in front of purple_door_1 at that time or later. We've been in front of purple_door_1, but only after we left room_4.
- We haven't been in front of purple_door_2 yet.
- purple_door_2 must be locked at some point (which it is in the initial state).
- If purple_door_2 is locked, we need to be holding an object at that time or later, which we did when we picked up green_box_2.
- Before purple_door_2 can be unlocked, either green_box_2 must be in room_1 or we must be in room_3. We currently have green_box_2 in room_2 and we're in room_1, so we don't satisfy this yet.

Hmm, let's rethink the plan. Let's make sure we satisfy all the constraints.

We are in room_4 at the start. We need to be in front of purple_door_1, but that door connects room_1 and room_2, which we can't directly access from room_4. 

Actually, let's rework the initial plan.

Starting in room_4:

1. We need to go to red_door_1: gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2
2. Unlock red_door_1: toggle red_door_1
3. Go to room_2: gotoroom room_4 room_2 red_door_1

Now, we're in room_2. One of the constraints is that before we can be in front of yellow_door_1, we must be in room_2, which we now are.

4. Go to purple_door_1: gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1
5. Unlock purple_door_1: toggle purple_door_1
6. Go to room_1: gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1

Now, we're in room_1. We can meet the constraint that says "If we're in room_4, we must be in front of purple_door_1 at that time or later" by going back to room_4 and then to purple_door_1.

7. Go to yellow_door_1: gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3
8. Unlock yellow_door_1: toggle yellow_door_1

Now, yellow_door_1 is unlocked, and we're in front of it, which seems to satisfy the goal. But we still need to check the remaining constraints.

9. Go to room_3: gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1

Now, we're in room_3. Before purple_door_2 can be unlocked, either green_box_2 must be in room_1 or we must be in room_3, which we now are.

10. Go to purple_door_2: gotodoor purple_door_2 room_3 room_4
11. Unlock purple_door_2: toggle purple_door_2

But before we can be in front of purple_door_2, either green_box_2 must be in room_2 or we must be holding green_box_1. We've not arranged for this, so we need to go back and fix that.

Let's revise the plan:

Starting in room_4:

1. We need to go to red_door_1: gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2
2. Unlock red_door_1: toggle red_door_1
3. Go to room_2: gotoroom room_4 room_2 red_door_1

Now, we're in room_2. 

4. Go to purple_door_1: gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1
5. Unlock purple_door_1: toggle purple_door_1
6. Go to room_1: gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1

Now, we're in room_1. Let's pick up green_box_1 to satisfy the constraint for being in front of purple_door_2.

7. Go to green_box_1: gotoobject green_box_1 room_1
8. Pick up green_box_1: pick green_box_1 room_1

Now, let's go to room_3 via yellow_door_1.

9. Go to yellow_door_1: gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3
10. Unlock yellow_door_1: toggle yellow_door_1

Wait, before we can be in front of yellow_door_1, either we must be in room_2 or we must be holding green_box_2. We've been in room_2, so we're good.

11. Go to room_3: gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1

Now, since we're holding green_box_1 and we're in room_3, we can go to purple_door_2 and satisfy both constraints.

12. Go to purple_door_2: gotodoor purple_door_2 room_3 room_4
13. Unlock purple_door_2: toggle purple_door_2
14. Go back to room_1 to drop green_box_1: gotoroom room_3 room_4 purple_door_2
15. Go to room_2: gotoroom room_4 room_2 red_door_1
16. Go to room_1: gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1
17. Drop green_box_1: gotoempty
18. Drop the box: drop green_box_1 room_1

Now we need to be in front of yellow_door_1 and it should be unlocked.

19. Go to yellow_door_1: gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3

Actually, I'm confused, we couldn't have unlocked the door at step 10 when we had green_box_1 in hand. Let me trace back the steps. Actually, wait, we've been in room_2 so we actually can unlock yellow_door_1. so step 10 seems valid. Actually though, let's make sure we drop the object before completing the goal.

Let's redo this to make sure all the constraints are satisfied:

Starting in room_4:

1. Go to red_door_1: gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2
2. Unlock red_door_1: toggle red_door_1
3. Go to room_2: gotoroom room_4 room_2 red_door_1

Now, we're in room_2. This satisfies the constraint that before we can be in front of yellow_door_1, we must be in room_2.

4. Go to purple_door_1: gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1
5. Unlock purple_door_1: toggle purple_door_1
6. Go to room_1: gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1

Now, we're in room_1. Let's pick up green_box_1 to satisfy the constraint for being in front of purple_door_2.

7. Go to green_box_1: gotoobject green_box_1 room_1
8. Pick up green_box_1: pick green_box_1 room_1

Since we're holding green_box_1, we can now go to purple_door_2 and satisfy the constraint. But we're in room_1 and purple_door_2 connects room_3 and room_4. So we need to go to room_3 first.

9. Go to yellow_door_1: gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3
10. Unlock yellow_door_1: toggle yellow_door_1
11. Go to room_3: gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1

Now, we're in room_3. Before purple_door_2 can be unlocked, either green_box_2 must be in room_1 or we must be in room_3, which we now are.

12. Go to purple_door_2: gotodoor purple_door_2 room_3 room_4
13. Verify that purple_door_2 is locked (it is in the initial state).
14. Unlock purple_door_2: toggle purple_door_2

Now we've satisfied the following constraints:
- We've been in room_4 (initial state).
- We've been in front of purple_door_2.
- purple_door_2 was locked and then we unlocked it.
- Before purple_door_2 was unlocked, we were in room_3.
- Before we were in front of purple_door_2, we were holding green_box_1.
- The constraint "If purple_door_2 is locked, we need to be holding an object at that time or later" is satisfied because when purple_door_2 was locked, we were holding green_box_1.

Now, the goal is to be in front of yellow_door_1 and have it unlocked. We've already unlocked yellow_door_1, but we're not in front of it anymore.

15. Go back to room_1: gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_1
16. Drop green_box_1 (since we don't need it anymore): gotoempty
17. Drop the box: drop green_box_1 room_1
18. Go to yellow_door_1: gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3

Now yellow_door_1 is unlocked and we're in front of it, meaning the goal is satisfied.

But I fear we're missing a constraint, let's check:
- We need to be in room_4 at some point (we've actually been there in the initial state).
- If we're in room_4, we need to be in front of purple_door_1 at that time or later (we've actually been in front of purple_door_1 after we've been in room_4, so we're good). This constraint is actually odd because purple_door_1 connects room_1 and room_2, so you can't be in room_4 and in front of purple_door_1 at the same time.

So the constraint is "If expression 'you are in room_4' holds in some state s, then expression 'you are in front of purple_door_1' must hold at s or at some state after s". We've been in room_4 (initial state), and we've been in front of purple_door_1 in step 4, which is after the initial state.

We might need to go back to room_4 one more time before going to the unlocked yellow_door_1, just to be sure. So, let's finalize the plan:

1. Go to red_door_1: gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2
2. Unlock red_door_1: toggle red_door_1
3. Go to room_2: gotoroom room_4 room_2 red_door_1
4. Go to purple_door_1: gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1
5. Unlock purple_door_1: toggle purple_door_1
6. Go to room_1: gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1
7. Go to green_box_1: gotoobject green_box_1 room_1
8. Pick up green_box_1: pick green_box_1 room_1
9. Go to yellow_door_1: gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3
10. Unlock yellow_door_1: toggle yellow_door_1
11. Go to room_3: gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1
12. Go to purple_door_2: gotodoor purple_door_2 room_3 room_4
13. Verify that purple_door_2 is locked (it is in the initial state).
14. Unlock purple_door_2: toggle purple_door_2
15. Go to room_4: gotoroom room_3 room_4 purple_door_2
16. Go back to room_3: gotoroom room_4 room_3 purple_door_2
17. Go to room_1: gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_1
18. Drop green_box_1: gotoempty
19. Drop the box: drop green_box_1 room_1
20. Go to yellow_door_1: gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3

This plan should satisfy all the constraints and the goal.

Actually, I'm worrying that the constraint "At least one of the following conditions is true: "green_box_2 is in room_2", "you are holding green_box_1"". Has to be satisfied before we even go in room 3, so that we can go in front of purple_door_2 in room_3.

Let's revisit this plan. We're initially in room_4. We have a constraint that if we're in room_4, we must be in front of purple_door_1 at that time or later. So at some point, we need to be in front of purple_door_1. Also, we need to be in front of purple_door_2 and yellow_door_1 at some points.

1. The goal is to be in front of yellow_door_1 and have it unlocked.
2. yellow_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3.
3. To be in front of yellow_door_1, we need to be in room_1 or room_3. 
4. Before we can be in front of yellow_door_1, either we must be in room_2 or we must be holding green_box_2.
5. To get to room_1 or room_3 from room_4, we need to go through either room_2 or room_3.
6. To get to room_2, we need to go through red_door_1, which is locked. So we need to unlock it.

Let's start the plan again to make sure we're satisfying the constraints:

1. Go to red_door_1: gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2
2. Unlock red_door_1: toggle red_door_1
3. Go to room_2: gotoroom room_4 room_2 red_door_1

Now we're in room_2, which satisfies the constraint that before we can be in front of yellow_door_1, we must be in room_2.

4. Go to purple_door_1: gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1
5. Unlock purple_door_1: toggle purple_door_1

We've now been in front of purple_door_1, which satisfies the constraint that if we're in room_4, we must be in front of purple_door_1 at that time or later.

6. Go to room_1: gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1

Now we're in room_1. Let's pick up green_box_1 so that we can satisfy the constraint for being in front of purple_door_2.

7. Go to green_box_1: gotoobject green_box_1 room_1
8. Pick up green_box_1: pick green_box_1 room_1

Now we're holding green_box_1, so we can be in front of purple_door_2. Also, we're in room_1, so we can be in front of yellow_door_1.

9. Go to yellow_door_1: gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3
10. Unlock yellow_door_1: toggle yellow_door_1
11. Go to room_3: gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1
12. Go to purple_door_2: gotodoor purple_door_2 room_3 room_4

Now we've been in front of purple_door_2, which satisfies the constraint.

13. Unlock purple_door_2: toggle purple_door_2

Now purple_door_2 is unlocked, which satisfies the constraint that purple_door_2 must be unlocked at some point. And we were in room_3 when we unlocked it, which satisfies the constraint that before purple_door_2 can be unlocked, either green_box_2 must be in room_1 or we must be in room_3.

Now, we've satisfied all the constraints except the goal. The goal is to be in front of yellow_door_1 and have it unlocked. We've already unlocked yellow_door_1, but we're not in front of it anymore.

14. Go to room_4: gotoroom room_3 room_4 purple_door_2

Let's drop green_box_1 now.

15. Drop green_box_1: gotoempty
16. Drop the box: drop green_box_1 room_4

Now we've also satisfied the constraint that if purple_door_2 is locked, we need to be holding an object at that time or later. purple_door_2 was locked until step 13, and we were holding green_box_1 during that time.

17. Go back to room_3: gotoroom room_4 room_3 purple_door_2
18. Go to room_1 through yellow_door_1: gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_1
19. Go to yellow_door_1: gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3

Now we're in front of yellow_door_1 and it's unlocked, so the goal is satisfied.

Let's check if all the constraints are satisfied:

1. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'you are in room_4'" - Yes, we were in room_4 initially and also in step 14.
2. "If expression 'you are in room_4' holds in some state s, then expression 'you are in front of purple_door_1' must hold at s or at some state after s" - Yes, we were in front of purple_door_1 in step 4, which is after the initial state where we were in room_4.
3. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'you are in front of purple_door_2'" - Yes, we were in front of purple_door_2 in step 12.
4. "If expression 'you are in front of purple_door_2' holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: 'At least one of the following conditions is true: "green_box_2 is in room_2", "you are holding green_box_1"'" - Yes, we were holding green_box_1 in step 8, which is before step 12.
5. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'purple_door_2 is locked'" - Yes, purple_door_2 was locked in the initial state.
6. "If expression 'purple_door_2 is locked' holds in some state s, then expression 'you are holding some object' must hold at s or at some state after s" - Yes, we were holding green_box_1 in steps 8-15, which is after the initial state.
7. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'purple_door_2 is not locked'" - Yes, we unlocked purple_door_2 in step 13.
8. "If expression 'purple_door_2 is not locked' holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: 'At least one of the following conditions is true: "green_box_2 is in room_1", "you are in room_3"'" - Yes, we were in room_3 in step 11, which is before step 13.
9. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'you are in front of yellow_door_1'" - Yes, we were in front of yellow_door_1 in steps 9 and 19.
10. "If expression 'you are in front of yellow_door_1' holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: 'At least one of the following conditions is true: "you are in room_2", "you are holding green_box_2"'" - Yes, we were in room_2 in step 3, which is before steps 9 and 19.

All the constraints are satisfied, and the goal is satisfied. The plan is valid.

Let's put the plan into the correct format:

```
gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2
toggle red_door_1
gotoroom room_4 room_2 red_door_1
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1
toggle purple_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1
gotoobject green_box_1 room_1
pick green_box_1 room_1
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3
toggle yellow_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1
gotodoor purple_door_2 room_3 room_4
toggle purple_door_2
gotoroom room_3 room_4 purple_door_2
gotoempty
drop green_box_1 room_4
gotoroom room_4 room_3 purple_door_2
gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_1
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3
```

But wait, this isn't optimal.  Let me see if I can make the plan shorter:

1. Go to red_door_1: gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2
2. Unlock red_door_1: toggle red_door_1
3. Go to room_2: gotoroom room_4 room_2 red_door_1
4. Go to purple_door_1: gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1
5. Unlock purple_door_1: toggle purple_door_1
6. Go to room_1: gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1
7. Go to green_box_1: gotoobject green_box_1 room_1
8. Pick up green_box_1: pick green_box_1 room_1
9. Go to yellow_door_1: gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3
10. Unlock yellow_door_1: toggle yellow_door_1

Now we've unlocked yellow_door_1 and we're in front of it, so the goal is satisfied. Let's check if all the constraints are satisfied:

1. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'you are in room_4'" - Yes, we were in room_4 initially.
2. "If expression 'you are in room_4' holds in some state s, then expression 'you are in front of purple_door_1' must hold at s or at some state after s" - Yes, we were in front of purple_door_1 in step 4, which is after the initial state where we were in room_4.
3. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'you are in front of purple_door_2'" - No, we haven't been in front of purple_door_2 yet.
4. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'purple_door_2 is locked'" - Yes, purple_door_2 is locked in the initial state.
5. "If expression 'purple_door_2 is locked' holds in some state s, then expression 'you are holding some object' must hold at s or at some state after s" - Yes, we were holding green_box_1 in steps 8 onwards, which is after the initial state.
6. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'purple_door_2 is not locked'" - No, we haven't unlocked purple_door_2 yet.
7. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'you are in front of yellow_door_1'" - Yes, we were in front of yellow_door_1 in step 9.
8. "If expression 'you are in front of yellow_door_1' holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: 'At least one of the following conditions is true: "you are in room_2", "you are holding green_box_2"'" - Yes, we were in room_2 in step 3, which is before step 9.

We're missing a couple of constraints. Let's continue the plan:

11. Go to room_3: gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1
12. Go to purple_door_2: gotodoor purple_door_2 room_3 room_4
13. Unlock purple_door_2: toggle purple_door_2

Now we've also satisfied constraints 3 and 6. Let's check the remaining constraints:

7. "If expression 'purple_door_2 is not locked' holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: 'At least one of the following conditions is true: "green_box_2 is in room_1", "you are in room_3"'" - Yes, we were in room_3 in step 11, which is before step 13.

All the constraints are satisfied, and we got to the goal in step 10. The rest of the steps are just to satisfy the constraints. Actually, we can go to the yellow_door_1 after unlocking purple_door_2 to satisfy the goal.

14. Go back to room_1: gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_1
15. Go to yellow_door_1: gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3

So the whole plan is:

1. Go to red_door_1: gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2
2. Unlock red_door_1: toggle red_door_1
3. Go to room_2: gotoroom room_4 room_2 red_door_1
4. Go to purple_door_1: gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1
5. Unlock purple_door_1: toggle purple_door_1
6. Go to room_1: gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1
7. Go to green_box_1: gotoobject green_box_1 room_1
8. Pick up green_box_1: pick green_box_1 room_1
9. Go to yellow_door_1: gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3
10. Unlock yellow_door_1: toggle yellow_door_1
11. Go to room_3: gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1
12. Go to purple_door_2: gotodoor purple_door_2 room_3 room_4
13. Unlock purple_door_2: toggle purple_door_2
14. Go back to room_1: gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_1
15. Go to yellow_door_1: gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3

Now let's format this properly:

```
gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2
toggle red_door_1
gotoroom room_4 room_2 red_door_1
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1
toggle purple_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1
gotoobject green_box_1 room_1
pick green_box_1 room_1
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3
toggle yellow_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1
gotodoor purple_door_2 room_3 room_4

gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_1
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3
```

Wait, I noticed something. The goal is to have a yellow door unlocked and be in front of it. We've satisfied this in step 10. But then, do we need to continue the plan to satisfy the constraints?

Actually, I think we need to satisfy all the constraints before we can reach the goal. So, steps 11-15 are necessary.

Actually, let's carefully check the entire problem again:

1. We have been in room_4 (initial state).
2. We have been in front of purple_door_1 at step 4, which is after the initial state. This satisfies the constraint that if we're in room_4, then we must be in front of purple_door_1 at that time or later.
3. We have been in front of purple_door_2 at step 12. Before that, we were holding green_box_1, which satisfies the constraint that before we can be in front of purple_door_2, either green_box_2 must be in room_2 or we must be holding green_box_1.
4. purple_door_2 was locked in the initial state, which satisfies the constraint that purple_door_2 must be locked at some point.
5. We were holding green_box_1 at steps 8-15, which is after the initial state. This satisfies the constraint that if purple_door_2 is locked, then we must be holding an object at that time or later.
6. We unlocked purple_door_2 at step 13, which satisfies the constraint that purple_door_2 must be unlocked at some point.
7. We were in room_3 at step 11, which is before step 13. This satisfies the constraint that before purple_door_2 can be unlocked, either green_box_2 must be in room_1 or we must be in room_3.
8. We were in front of yellow_door_1 at steps 9 and 15. This satisfies the constraint that we must be in front of yellow_door_1 at some point.
9. We were in room_2 at step 3, which is before steps 9 and 15. This satisfies the constraint that before we can be in front of yellow_door_1, either we must be in room_2 or we must be holding green_box_2.

I think that's all the constraints. Now, the goal is to have a yellow door unlocked and be in front of it. yellow_door_1 is yellow (as the name suggests), and it is unlocked starting from step 10. We are in front of yellow_door_1 at steps 9, 10, and 15. So, at step 10, we have satisfied the goal.

But wait, let me make sure there are no more constraints. I'm a bit concerned about whether green_box_1 is still in our hands, because we unlocked yellow_door_1 in step 10, if we were still holding green_box_1, then we wouldn't be able to toggle the door. Let me make sure we're allowed to unlock doors while holding objects.

OK, from the description, I don't see a constraint that says we can't toggle a door while holding an object. The only constraint on toggle is that we must be in front of the door we want to toggle. So, I think we can toggle a door while holding an object. I think my second plan works (steps 1-15). The plan spans 15 actions, which seems short enough.

I've tried to make the plan as short as possible and I believe 15 is the minimum number of steps required. Here's the final plan:

```
gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2
toggle red_door_1
gotoroom room_4 room_2 red_door_1
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1
toggle purple_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1
gotoobject green_box_1 room_1
pick green_box_1 room_1
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3
toggle yellow_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1
gotodoor purple_door_2 room_3 room_4
toggle purple_door_2
gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_1
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3
```

Actually, after thinking more, I realize that we could further optimize the plan. The goal is to be in front of yellow_door_1 and have it unlocked. We achieve this in step 10. However, we still need to satisfy all the constraints, which we do by the end of step 13. So, we can actually stop after step 13 and have a valid plan.

Actually, I note that I'm confusing myself. Let's go step-by-step, one constraint at a time:

1. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'you are in room_4'" - Yes, we were in room_4 initially.
2. "If expression 'you are in room_4' holds in some state s, then expression 'you are in front of purple_door_1' must hold at s or at some state after s" - Yes, we were in front of purple_door_1 in step 4, which is after the initial state where we were in room_4.
3. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'you are in front of purple_door_2'" - Yes, we were in front of purple_door_2 in step 12.
4. "If expression 'you are in front of purple_door_2' holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: 'At least one of the following conditions is true: "green_box_2 is in room_2", "you are holding green_box_1"'" - Yes, we were holding green_box_1 in step 8, which is before step 12.
5. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'purple_door_2 is locked'" - Yes, purple_door_2 is locked in the initial state.
6. "If expression 'purple_door_2 is locked' holds in some state s, then expression 'you are holding some object' must hold at s or at some state after s" - Yes, we were holding green_box_1 in steps 8 onwards, which is after the initial state.
7. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'purple_door_2 is not locked'" - Yes, we unlocked purple_door_2 in step 13.
8. "If expression 'purple_door_2 is not locked' holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: 'At least one of the following conditions is true: "green_box_2 is in room_1", "you are in room_3"'" - Yes, we were in room_3 in step 11, which is before step 13.
9. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'you are in front of yellow_door_1'" - Yes, we were in front of yellow_door_1 in step 9.
10. "If expression 'you are in front of yellow_door_1' holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: 'At least one of the following conditions is true: "you are in room_2", "you are holding green_box_2"'" - Yes, we were in room_2 in step 3, which is before step 9.

So, all the constraints are satisfied by step 13. The goal is to have a yellow door unlocked and be in front of it. yellow_door_1 is yellow (as the name suggests), and it is unlocked starting from step 10. We are in front of yellow_door_1 at steps 9 and 10. So, at step 10, we have satisfied the goal.

Wait, but at step 9, the door is still locked. We're in front of it, but it's not unlocked. We unlock it in step 10, but I'm not sure if we're still in front of it after toggling it. 

I think I was confusing myself because of the statement of the goal: "There is a door d such that "The following conditions are all true: "d is yellow", "you are in front of d", "d is not locked""

This means that there needs to be a door that is yellow, and we need to be in front of it, and it is not locked. So, after we toggle yellow_door_1 in step 10, we should still be in front of it, and it should be unlocked.

But to be sure, let's go back to steps 14 and 15, and I'd like to make sure we end the plan with steps 14 and 15, so that we're in front of yellow_door_1 at the end.

1. Go to red_door_1: gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2
2. Unlock red_door_1: toggle red_door_1
3. Go to room_2: gotoroom room_4 room_2 red_door_1
4. Go to purple_door_1: gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1
5. Unlock purple_door_1: toggle purple_door_1
6. Go to room_1: gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1
7. Go to green_box_1: gotoobject green_box_1 room_1
8. Pick up green_box_1: pick green_box_1 room_1
9. Go to yellow_door_1: gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3
10. Unlock yellow_door_1: toggle yellow_door_1
11. Go to room_3: gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1
12. Go to purple_door_2: gotodoor purple_door_2 room_3 room_4
13. Unlock purple_door_2: toggle purple_door_2
14. Go back to room_1: gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_1
15. Go to yellow_door_1: gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3

By step 15, we're in front of yellow_door_1, and it's unlocked (since we unlocked it in step 10). So, the goal is satisfied.

So, the final plan is:

```
gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2
toggle red_door_1
gotoroom room_4 room_2 red_door_1
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1
toggle purple_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1
gotoobject green_box_1 room_1
pick green_box_1 room_1
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3
toggle yellow_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1
gotodoor purple_door_2 room_3 room_4
toggle purple_door_2
gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_1
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3
```

The plan seems to be shortest possible, given all the constraints, and it satisfies the goal.

Actually! I'm overthinking this. To meet the goal, we need to be in front of yellow_door_1 and it needs to be unlocked (we also need to satisfy several constraints). We meet the goal at step 10, where we unlock yellow_door_1. We've already been in front of it since step 9. But if the toggling would take us away from the front of the door (which isn't specified in the problem statement), then let's add one more step - going back to the door:

1. Go to red_door_1: gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2
2. Unlock red_door_1: toggle red_door_1
3. Go to room_2: gotoroom room_4 room_2 red_door_1
4. Go to purple_door_1: gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1
5. Unlock purple_door_1: toggle purple_door_1
6. Go to room_1: gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1
7. Go to green_box_1: gotoobject green_box_1 room_1
8. Pick up green_box_1: pick green_box_1 room_1
9. Go to yellow_door_1: gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3
10. Unlock yellow_door_1: toggle yellow_door_1
11. Go to yellow_door_1: gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3

At this point, we've satisfied the goal. But we still need to satisfy all the constraints. Let's continue:

12. Go to room_3: gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1
13. Go to purple_door_2: gotodoor purple_door_2 room_3 room_4
14. Unlock purple_door_2: toggle purple_door_2

Now we've satisfied all the constraints, and we've satisfied the goal at step 11.

15. Go back to room_1: gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_1
16. Go to yellow_door_1: gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3

At step 16, we've again satisfied the goal, and we've also satisfied all the constraints.

Actually, steps 15 and 16 are not necessary to satisfy either the goal or the constraints. But step 11 might be redundant if the effects of toggling a door don't move us away from the door. Let's check the effects of "toggle": "After performing this action on a door d, (i) if d was locked, then it becomes unlocked, and (ii) if d was unlocked, then it becomes locked."

There's no indication that toggling a door moves us away from the door. So, I think step 11 is redundant.

Let's finalize the plan. Using the constraints and the goal, I think the minimum number of steps required is 14:

```
gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2
toggle red_door_1
gotoroom room_4 room_2 red_door_1
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1
toggle purple_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1
gotoobject green_box_1 room_1
pick green_box_1 room_1
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3
toggle yellow_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1
gotodoor purple_door_2 room_3 room_4
toggle purple_door_2
gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_1
```

Actually, after thinking about this one more time. According to the problem statement: "toggle": After performing this action on a door d, (i) if d was locked, then it becomes unlocked, and (ii) if d was unlocked, then it becomes locked.". There's no indication that it move me away from the door. So, I think after step 10 (toggle yellow_door_1), I'm still in front of yellow_door_1, and it's now unlocked, which satisfies the goal. But I've only satisfied constraints 1, 2, 5, 6, 9, and 10 at this point. I still need to satisfy constraints 3, 4, 7, and 8, which I do by going to purple_door_2 and toggling it.

So, the following 14-step plan should be valid and optimal:

```
gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2
toggle red_door_1
gotoroom room_4 room_2 red_door_1
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1
toggle purple_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1
gotoobject green_box_1 room_1
pick green_box_1 room_1
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3
toggle yellow_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1
gotodoor purple_door_2 room_3 room_4
toggle purple_door_2
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1
```

Actually, in step 14, it should be gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1, not gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3, since we're in room_3 at this point.

Let's make a tiny fix:

```
gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2
toggle red_door_1
gotoroom room_4 room_2 red_door_1
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1
toggle purple_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1
gotoobject green_box_1 room_1
pick green_box_1 room_1
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3
toggle yellow_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1
gotodoor purple_door_2 room_3 room_4
toggle purple_door_2
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1
```

Ah for step 14, we actually got the constraint backwards. We need to be in front of yellow_door_1, and we're in room_3 in step 14. yellow_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3. So to be in front of yellow_door_1 from room_3, we should say gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1. I fixed that.

Just to be absolutely sure, let me check:

After step 13, we're in room_3, having just toggled purple_door_2. We want to be in front of yellow_door_1. According to the problem statement, gotodoor has a precondition: "goto door": you may only go in front of a door d if (i) you are in a room which door d is connecting with another room, and (ii) there is no object blocking the position in front of d in the room you are currently in.

yellow_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3, so it satisfies condition (i) because we're currently in room_3. And as we're not told there's any object in front of the door in room_3, I assume condition (ii) is met as well (if there would have been an object in front of the door, it should have been in the "you can't go gotoobject in front of a door" condition).

So, we should indeed be able to go to yellow_door_1 from room_3:

```
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1
```

This should be right.
