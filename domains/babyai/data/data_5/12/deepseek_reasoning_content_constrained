Okay, let's tackle this planning problem step by step. The goal is to find a sequence of actions that achieves the final goal while satisfying all the given constraints. Let's break down the problem and see what needs to be done.

First, the initial state: the agent starts in room_4. The doors are all locked. The final goal is to have a yellow door that the agent is in front of, which is unlocked. The yellow doors are yellow_door_1, which connects room_1 and room_3. So the target door is probably yellow_door_1. But the goal requires that there exists a door d that is yellow, the agent is in front of it, and it's unlocked. So the plan must end with the agent in front of yellow_door_1 (since that's the only yellow door) and it being unlocked.

Now, looking at the constraints:

1. Must be in room_4 at least once. Check, since the agent starts there, but maybe needs to return.
2. If in room_4 in some state, then must be in front of purple_door_1 at that state or later. Purple_door_1 connects room_1 and room_2. Since the agent starts in room_4, to get to purple_door_1, they need to move through other doors.
3. Must be in front of purple_door_2 at some point. Purple_door_2 connects room_3 and room_4. Since the agent is starting in room_4, maybe they can go there first.
4. If in front of purple_door_2, there must be an earlier state where green_box_2 is in room_2 or the agent is holding green_box_1. Green_box_2 is initially in room_4. So moving green_box_2 to room_2 would satisfy that. Alternatively, holding green_box_1, which is in room_1.
5. Purple_door_2 must be locked in some state. Since it starts locked, but maybe we need to unlock and relock it? Wait, the initial state says all doors are locked. So the constraint might be satisfied by the initial state, but perhaps the agent needs to lock it again after unlocking. Wait, but the effect of toggle is to switch the state. So if it's locked initially, toggling it would unlock, then toggling again would lock. So maybe after unlocking it, we need to lock it again to satisfy that constraint. But the constraint says "The following expression must hold in at least one state: purple_door_2 is locked". Since it's initially locked, but the agent starts in room_4. However, if the agent toggles it to unlock, then purple_door_2 would be unlocked. But the constraint requires that in some state, it's locked. So unless the agent re-locks it, but the initial state already satisfies that. Wait, the initial state has purple_door_2 locked. So the constraint is already satisfied in the initial state. So the agent doesn't need to do anything for that constraint. Wait, but maybe during the plan, the agent might unlock it, so the initial state's locked status is valid. So maybe the constraint is already met. So perhaps no action needed for that.

But let's check all constraints again:

Constraint 5: "purple_door_2 is locked" must hold in at least one state. Since initially it's locked, and the agent starts in room_4, which is connected to room_3 via purple_door_2. So the initial state satisfies this. So unless the agent's actions change that, but the constraint is satisfied as long as in some state (including the initial) it's locked. So that's okay.

But then constraint 6 says that if purple_door_2 is locked in some state s, then the agent must be holding an object in s or after. So when purple_door_2 is locked (initially), then in the same state (initial) the agent is not holding anything, so that violates the constraint. Wait, wait. The constraint is: if purple_door_2 is locked in state s, then the agent must be holding some object at s or after. So in the initial state, purple_door_2 is locked, and the agent is not holding anything. So this violates the constraint unless the agent later holds an object. So the agent must, at some point after the initial state, hold an object. So the plan must include picking up an object. Because the initial state has purple_door_2 locked, and the agent must hold something either at that state (which they aren't) or in a later state. Therefore, the agent must pick up an object at some point to satisfy this.

So the plan needs to include picking up an object. Let's note that.

Now, constraint 7: "purple_door_2 is not locked" must hold in some state. So the agent must unlock it at some point. And then constraint 8 says that when purple_door_2 is not locked, there must be an earlier state where green_box_2 is in room_1 or the agent was in room_3. So to unlock purple_door_2, the agent needs to toggle it. But to toggle a door, they must be in front of it. So the agent needs to go to purple_door_2 in room_4 (since they start in room_4), gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_3. But wait, the doors are between rooms. So purple_door_2 connects room_4 and room_3. So from room_4, the agent can go to the door. But preconditions for gotodoor: (i) in a room connected by the door, (ii) no object blocking the position in front of d in current room.

In the initial state, are any objects blocking the door positions? The initial state says green_box_2 is in room_4. If the green_box_2 is blocking the position in front of purple_door_2 in room_4, then the agent can't goto door until it's moved. So the agent needs to pick up green_box_2 and move it. But wait, the initial objects in room_4 are green_box_2. So if green_box_2 is in room_4, and if its position is in front of the door, then the agent can't go to the door unless the box is moved. But maybe the boxes are not blocking the door unless specified. Wait, the problem says "the position in front of d in the room you are currently in" must not be blocked. So if in room_4, the position in front of purple_door_2 is blocked by green_box_2, then the agent can't gotodoor unless the box is moved. So the agent needs to move green_box_2.

But how? The agent is in room_4, can pick up green_box_2. So first, gotoobject green_box_2 room_4, pick it up, then drop it somewhere else to unblock the door.

But let's see. The initial state has green_box_2 in room_4. So to goto the door, the agent needs to be in room_4 and the door's position not blocked. If green_box_2 is blocking the door, then the agent can't go to the door unless the box is moved. So the steps could be:

1. gotoobject green_box_2 room_4
2. pick green_box_2 room_4
3. drop green_box_2 somewhere else (maybe room_4, but that would still block unless moved to another position. Wait, the drop action requires that the position in front is empty. So after picking up the box, the agent can go to an empty spot and drop it, thereby unblocking the door.

Wait, but the agent can drop the box in the same room but in a different position. So after picking up green_box_2, the agent can gotoempty (which moves them to an empty spot), then drop the box there, which would free up the door's position.

So steps:

- gotoobject green_box_2 room_4
- pick green_box_2 room_4
- gotoempty (now in front of empty spot)
- drop green_box_2 room_4 (now green_box_2 is in room_4, but not blocking the door's position)

Then, the agent can go to purple_door_2 in room_4.

But let's check the constraints again. Constraint 4 says that if the agent is in front of purple_door_2 in some state, then there must be an earlier state where green_box_2 is in room_2 or the agent is holding green_box_1. However, in this scenario, the agent is moving green_box_2 in room_4. So green_box_2 is still in room_4, not room_2. So this would not satisfy constraint 4. Therefore, the agent must either move green_box_2 to room_2 or hold green_box_1 before being in front of purple_door_2.

But green_box_1 is in room_1. So to hold green_box_1, the agent needs to go to room_1, which is connected via yellow_door_1 (room_1 and room_3) and purple_door_1 (room_1 and room_2). But all doors are locked initially. So the agent needs to unlock doors to get to room_1.

Alternatively, moving green_box_2 to room_2. But how? The agent starts in room_4. To get to room_2, they can go via red_door_1 (connects room_4 and room_2), but red_door_1 is locked. So the agent needs to unlock red_door_1. To unlock red_door_1, they need to be in front of it. To be in front of red_door_1, which connects room_4 and room_2. Since the agent is in room_4, they can go to red_door_1 if it's not blocked. But if any object is blocking the door's position in room_4, the agent can't. The initial state has green_box_2 in room_4. If green_box_2 is blocking red_door_1's position, then the agent needs to move it. But red_door_1 connects room_4 and room_2. So the position in front of red_door_1 in room_4 could be blocked by green_box_2. So the agent needs to move green_box_2 first.

But wait, the initial position of green_box_2 in room_4â€”where is it located? The problem doesn't specify exact positions, only rooms. So we have to assume that objects are not blocking doors unless specified. The problem states that the preconditions for gotodoor require that the position in front of the door is not blocked. So if the agent is in room_4, and wants to go to red_door_1, they need to check if any object is blocking that position. Since green_box_2 is in room_4, but unless it's in front of the door, it's not blocking. But the problem's initial state doesn't specify positions, so perhaps we can assume that objects are not blocking doors unless stated. Therefore, the agent can go to the door unless there's an object explicitly blocking. Since the problem doesn't mention any objects blocking doors in the initial state, the agent can proceed to the door.

Wait, but the initial state description doesn't mention any objects blocking doors. So maybe the doors are not blocked. So the agent can go to the door directly. But this might not be the case. The problem says that the preconditions for gotodoor are that (i) you are in a room connected by the door, and (ii) no object is blocking the position in front of d in the current room. So the agent must check if any object is in front of the door in their current room. Since the initial state doesn't specify positions, perhaps we can assume that objects are not in front of doors unless stated. Therefore, the agent can go to the door without moving objects first.

But in the initial state, green_box_2 is in room_4. If the position in front of red_door_1 in room_4 is occupied by green_box_2, then the agent can't go there. But since the problem doesn't specify positions, maybe we can assume that the objects are placed such that doors are not blocked. So the agent can proceed.

But to be safe, perhaps the agent needs to move green_box_2 to satisfy constraint 4 when they later go to purple_door_2. Because if the agent moves green_box_2 to room_2, then that satisfies the condition for constraint 4. Alternatively, if the agent picks up green_box_1 (which is in room_1), but that requires getting to room_1 first.

But let's outline the steps needed to achieve the goal:

The final goal is to have the agent in front of a yellow door (yellow_door_1) that's unlocked. Yellow_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3. So the agent needs to get to room_1 or room_3 and be in front of yellow_door_1, then toggle it to unlock.

But initially, all doors are locked. So the agent must first unlock doors to move between rooms.

Starting in room_4, the agent can try to go to room_2 via red_door_1. But red_door_1 is locked. To unlock it, the agent must be in front of it and toggle it. So steps could be:

1. gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2 (precondition: in room_4, door connects to room_2, and no object blocking)
2. toggle red_door_1 (unlocks it)
3. gotoroom room_4 room_2 red_door_1 (now in room_2)
4. In room_2, there's grey_ball_1 and blue_ball_1. Maybe pick one up, but need to check constraints.

But wait, constraint 6 requires that when purple_door_2 is locked (which it is initially), the agent must be holding an object in that state or after. Since the initial state has purple_door_2 locked, the agent must hold an object at some point. So the agent must pick up an object at least once. So in room_4, the agent could pick up green_box_2 first.

Let's try that:

1. gotoobject green_box_2 room_4
2. pick green_box_2 room_4 (now holding it)
3. Then, proceed to unlock red_door_1.

But to unlock red_door_1, the agent needs to be in front of it. But when holding an object, can they still gotodoor? The preconditions for gotodoor don't mention holding an object as a restriction. So yes, the agent can carry an object and go to the door.

So:

1. gotoobject green_box_2 room_4
2. pick green_box_2 room_4
3. gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2
4. toggle red_door_1 (unlocks it)
5. gotoroom room_4 room_2 red_door_1 (now in room_2)
6. Now, the agent is in room_2. They need to get to room_1 to reach yellow_door_1. Room_2 is connected to room_1 via purple_door_1. But purple_door_1 is locked. So need to unlock it.

But to unlock purple_door_1, the agent must be in front of it in room_2. So:

6. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1
7. toggle purple_door_1 (unlocks it)
8. gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1 (now in room_1)

Now in room_1, which has green_box_1 and yellow_box_1. The goal is to get to yellow_door_1. Which connects room_1 and room_3. So:

9. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3
10. toggle yellow_door_1 (unlocks it)
11. Now, the agent is in front of yellow_door_1, which is yellow and now unlocked. So this satisfies the final goal.

But wait, the final goal requires that the agent is in front of d (yellow_door_1) and d is not locked. So after step 10, the agent is in front of yellow_door_1 and it's unlocked. So that's the goal. So steps up to 10 would achieve the goal.

But let's check the constraints:

Constraint 1: The agent must be in room_4 at least once. They start there, so that's satisfied.

Constraint 2: Any state where they are in room_4 must have them in front of purple_door_1 at that state or after. The agent starts in room_4. After leaving, do they return? In the current steps, after step 5, they are in room_2 and proceed to room_1. They don't return to room_4. So the initial state is in room_4, and after that, they never go back. So the initial state is the only state where they are in room_4. Therefore, they must be in front of purple_door_1 in the initial state or later. But they are in room_4 in the initial state. To satisfy the constraint, they must be in front of purple_door_1 at that state or after. But purple_door_1 is between room_1 and room_2. So the agent needs to be in front of purple_door_1 after leaving room_4. In the steps above, the agent goes to purple_door_1 in room_2 (step 6). So after leaving room_4, they are in room_2 and go to purple_door_1. So when they are in room_4 initially, they must later be in front of purple_door_1, which they do in step 6. So that's okay.

Constraint 3: Must be in front of purple_door_2 at some point. Purple_door_2 connects room_3 and room_4. The agent starts in room_4 but doesn't interact with purple_door_2 in the current plan. So this constraint is not satisfied. So the current plan is invalid. Therefore, the agent needs to go to purple_door_2 at some point.

So the plan must include going to purple_door_2. Let's adjust the steps.

When the agent is in room_4 initially, they can go to purple_door_2 first.

But to satisfy constraint 4: when in front of purple_door_2, there must be an earlier state where green_box_2 is in room_2 or the agent is holding green_box_1.

In the initial plan, after picking green_box_2, the agent is holding it. So when they go to purple_door_2, if they do that after picking green_box_2, then the earlier state of holding green_box_2 would satisfy condition 4. Wait, but constraint 4 requires that when in front of purple_door_2, there's an earlier state where green_box_2 is in room_2 OR the agent was holding green_box_1. So if the agent is holding green_box_2 (which is in room_4), that doesn't satisfy the condition. They need to have green_box_2 in room_2 or hold green_box_1 (which is in room_1). So the agent must either move green_box_2 to room_2 or hold green_box_1 before going to purple_door_2.

So in the current plan, the agent is holding green_box_2 when they leave room_4. If they go to purple_door_2 before dropping it, then they can satisfy constraint 4 by having held green_box_2, but that's not green_box_1. Wait, no: the condition is green_box_2 in room_2 OR holding green_box_1. So holding green_box_2 doesn't satisfy it. Therefore, the agent must either move green_box_2 to room_2 or get green_box_1.

But moving green_box_2 to room_2 would require the agent to carry it to room_2. Let's adjust the plan:

1. gotoobject green_box_2 room_4
2. pick green_box_2 room_4
3. gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2
4. toggle red_door_1
5. gotoroom room_4 room_2 red_door_1 (now in room_2)
6. drop green_box_2 room_2 (now green_box_2 is in room_2)
7. Now, green_box_2 is in room_2, which satisfies constraint 4's first condition. Then later, when the agent goes to purple_door_2, constraint 4 is satisfied.

But then the agent needs to go to purple_door_2. To do that, they need to return to room_4. So after step 5, the agent is in room_2. To go back to room_4, use red_door_1 again (now unlocked). But let's see:

After step 5, agent is in room_2, has dropped green_box_2 there (step 6). Then they can go back to room_4 via red_door_1:

7. gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_4
8. gotoroom room_2 room_4 red_door_1 (now back in room_4)
9. gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_3 (now in front of purple_door_2)
10. toggle purple_door_2 (unlocks it)
But wait, the agent needs to satisfy constraint 7: purple_door_2 must be unlocked in some state, which this would do. Also, constraint 8: when purple_door_2 is unlocked, there must be an earlier state where green_box_2 is in room_1 or agent was in room_3. At step 10, when purple_door_2 is unlocked, the earlier state would be after step 6, where green_box_2 is in room_2 (not room_1) and agent was in room_2 and room_4. So that doesn't satisfy constraint 8. So constraint 8 requires that before unlocking purple_door_2, the agent was in room_3 or green_box_2 was in room_1. So this plan doesn't satisfy that. Therefore, the agent must have been in room_3 before unlocking purple_door_2, or have green_box_2 in room_1.

Alternatively, the agent can go to room_3 via purple_door_2 after unlocking it, but that would require unlocking it first, which is the step we're trying to do. So perhaps the agent needs to first go to room_3 through another door. But room_3 is connected to room_1 via yellow_door_1 and to room_4 via purple_door_2. So to get to room_3, the agent would need to go through room_1 first. Let's think.

After getting to room_1 via room_2 and purple_door_1 (unlocked), then the agent can go to room_3 via yellow_door_1. But yellow_door_1 is locked. So the agent needs to unlock it. So:

Continuing from step 6 (agent in room_2, green_box_2 in room_2):

7. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1
8. toggle purple_door_1 (unlocks it)
9. gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1 (now in room_1)
10. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3
11. toggle yellow_door_1 (unlocks it)
12. gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1 (now in room_3)
13. Now, in room_3, which is connected to room_4 via purple_door_2. So the agent can go to purple_door_2 from room_3.

But purple_door_2 is locked initially. So the agent needs to unlock it. But to unlock it, they need to be in front of it. So from room_3:

14. gotodoor purple_door_2 room_3 room_4
15. toggle purple_door_2 (unlocks it)
16. Now, the agent is in front of purple_door_2 (from room_3 side), which is now unlocked. This satisfies constraint 3 (must be in front of purple_door_2 at some state). Also, constraint 4: when in front of purple_door_2 (step 14), earlier state (step 6) has green_box_2 in room_2. So constraint 4 is satisfied.

Then, the agent can go back to room_4 via purple_door_2 (now unlocked):

16. gotoroom room_3 room_4 purple_door_2 (now in room_4 again)
17. Now, to satisfy constraint 2: being in room_4 (step 16) requires that the agent is in front of purple_door_1 at that state or after. But they are in room_4, so they need to be in front of purple_door_1 later. Purple_door_1 is between room_1 and room_2. So the agent would need to go back to room_2 or room_1 and be in front of purple_door_1 again.

But the final goal is to be in front of yellow_door_1, which is in room_1 or room_3. Let's see: after step 12, the agent is in room_3. Maybe they can proceed to yellow_door_1 from there.

But yellow_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3. So if the agent is in room_3, they can go to yellow_door_1:

From step 12 (agent in room_3):

13. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1
14. toggle yellow_door_1 (unlock it, but it was already unlocked in step 11)
Wait, no. In step 11, the agent toggles yellow_door_1, which was locked. So toggling it would unlock it. So after step 11, yellow_door_1 is unlocked.

Then, in room_3, the agent can go to yellow_door_1:

13. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1
14. Now, the agent is in front of yellow_door_1 (room_3 side). Since it's already unlocked, toggling is not needed. Then, this satisfies the final goal: being in front of a yellow door (yellow_door_1) that's unlocked.

So steps up to here would achieve the goal. But let's check all constraints again.

Constraint 5: purple_door_2 must be locked in some state. Initially, it's locked. Then, in step 15, the agent toggles it to unlocked. So after that, it's unlocked. But the initial state satisfies constraint 5. However, constraint 6 says that if purple_door_2 is locked in any state s, the agent must hold an object in s or after. In the initial state s0, purple_door_2 is locked, and the agent isn't holding anything. So they must hold an object after s0. In the plan, they pick up green_box_2 in step 2, so they are holding it from step 2 onwards until step 6 when they drop it. So after s0, they hold an object, which satisfies constraint 6.

Constraint 7: purple_door_2 must be unlocked in some state. That's achieved in step 15.

Constraint 8: when purple_door_2 is unlocked (step 15), there must be an earlier state where green_box_2 is in room_1 or the agent was in room_3. The agent was in room_3 in step 12, which is earlier than step 15. So that's satisfied.

Constraint 9: must be in front of yellow_door_1. This is achieved in step 13 (room_3 side) or step 10 (room_1 side). In the final goal, the agent needs to be in front of yellow_door_1 and it's unlocked. So step 13 or step 10 would suffice.

But the final goal is to have the agent in front of yellow_door_1 and it's unlocked. So the plan should end with the agent in front of yellow_door_1 and the door unlocked.

Putting all together, the steps could be:

1. gotoobject green_box_2 room_4
2. pick green_box_2 room_4
3. gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2
4. toggle red_door_1 (unlock)
5. gotoroom room_4 room_2 red_door_1 (now in room_2)
6. drop green_box_2 room_2 (now green_box_2 in room_2)
7. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1
8. toggle purple_door_1 (unlock)
9. gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1 (now in room_1)
10. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3
11. toggle yellow_door_1 (unlock)
12. gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1 (now in room_3)
13. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1
14. (now in front of yellow_door_1, which is unlocked)

But step 13 is redundant because step 12 already moves the agent to room_3. Wait, step 12 is gotoroom from room_1 to room_3 via yellow_door_1. Upon arriving in room_3, the agent is no longer in front of any door (effect iv of gotoroom). So step 12: after arriving in room_3, the agent is not in front of yellow_door_1. So they need to go to it again.

So:

12. gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1 (now in room_3)
13. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1
14. (now in front of yellow_door_1, which is unlocked)

At this point, the agent is in front of yellow_door_1 (room_3 side), which is unlocked. So the final goal is achieved.

Now, checking all constraints:

- Constraint 3: must be in front of purple_door_2. Not yet achieved. So we need to add steps to visit purple_door_2.

After step 6, green_box_2 is in room_2. The agent needs to go to purple_door_2 in room_4 or room_3. Let's add steps after step 6:

7. gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_4
8. gotoroom room_2 room_4 red_door_1 (back to room_4)
9. gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_3
10. toggle purple_door_2 (unlock)
But now, to unlock purple_door_2, the agent needs to be in front of it. However, the agent is in room_4 and can go to purple_door_2. But after step 6, the agent is in room_2, and needs to return to room_4.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let's reorganize.

Alternative approach:

The agent must go to purple_door_2 at some point. Let's ensure that after moving green_box_2 to room_2, the agent returns to room_4 and goes to purple_door_2.

So revised plan:

1. gotoobject green_box_2 room_4
2. pick green_box_2 room_4
3. gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2
4. toggle red_door_1 (unlock)
5. gotoroom room_4 room_2 red_door_1 (now in room_2)
6. drop green_box_2 room_2 (green_box_2 in room_2)
7. gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_4
8. gotoroom room_2 room_4 red_door_1 (back to room_4)
9. gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_3
10. toggle purple_door_2 (unlock)
11. Now, purple_door_2 is unlocked. Constraint 7 is satisfied (purple_door_2 not locked), and constraint 8 requires that before this, the agent was in room_3 or green_box_2 was in room_1. But green_box_2 is in room_2, and the agent was in room_4. So this doesn't satisfy constraint 8. Therefore, to satisfy constraint 8, the agent must have been in room_3 before step 10. But the agent hasn't been to room_3 yet. So this approach won't work.

Alternative: after moving green_box_2 to room_2, the agent proceeds to room_1, then room_3, then unlocks purple_door_2 from room_3.

Continuing from step 6:

7. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1
8. toggle purple_door_1 (unlock)
9. gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1 (now in room_1)
10. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3
11. toggle yellow_door_1 (unlock)
12. gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1 (now in room_3)
13. gotodoor purple_door_2 room_3 room_4
14. toggle purple_door_2 (unlock)
15. Now, the agent is in front of purple_door_2 (room_3 side), which is unlocked. This satisfies constraint 3 (being in front of purple_door_2). Also, constraint 4: when in front of purple_door_2 (step 13), earlier state (step 6) has green_box_2 in room_2. So constraint 4 is satisfied.

Then, the agent can proceed to yellow_door_1 from room_3:

16. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1
17. (now in front of yellow_door_1, which is unlocked. So the goal is achieved.)

Additionally, constraint 8: when purple_door_2 is unlocked (step 14), there must be an earlier state where agent was in room_3 (step 12) or green_box_2 in room_1. The agent was in room_3 in step 12, so that's satisfied.

Also, constraint 2: after returning to room_4 (if any), the agent must be in front of purple_door_1. But in this plan, the agent doesn't return to room_4 after step 5. So the initial state is the only time they are in room_4. So constraint 2 requires that at some point after being in room_4 (which is always after the initial state), they are in front of purple_door_1. In step 7, they are in front of purple_door_1. So that's satisfied.

Now, checking all constraints:

1. Agent was in room_4 (initial state) - satisfied.

2. After being in room_4 (initial), agent is in front of purple_door_1 in step 7 - satisfied.

3. Agent is in front of purple_door_2 in step 13 - satisfied.

4. When in front of purple_door_2 (step 13), earlier state has green_box_2 in room_2 (step 6) - satisfied.

5. purple_door_2 was locked in initial state - satisfied.

6. When purple_door_2 was locked (initially), agent later held green_box_2 (steps 2-6) - satisfied.

7. purple_door_2 is unlocked in step 14 - satisfied.

8. When purple_door_2 is unlocked (step 14), earlier state was agent in room_3 (step 12) - satisfied.

9. Agent is in front of yellow_door_1 in step 16 - satisfied.

10. When in front of yellow_door_1 (step 16), earlier state had agent in room_3 (step 12) or holding green_box_2 (step 2-6). But green_box_2 was dropped in step 6. The agent was in room_3 (step 12), so constraint 9 is satisfied.

Final goal: agent is in front of yellow_door_1 (step 16), which is yellow and unlocked - satisfied.

Now, let's write the step-by-step actions:

1. gotoobject green_box_2 room_4
2. pick green_box_2 room_4
3. gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2
4. toggle red_door_1
5. gotoroom room_4 room_2 red_door_1
6. drop green_box_2 room_2
7. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1
8. toggle purple_door_1
9. gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1
10. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3
11. toggle yellow_door_1
12. gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1
13. gotodoor purple_door_2 room_3 room_4
14. toggle purple_door_2
15. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1

Wait, step 15 is gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1, which puts the agent in front of yellow_door_1 (unlocked). This satisfies the final goal.

But wait, after step 12, the agent is in room_3. Then step 13: gotodoor purple_door_2 room_3 room_4 (puts them in front of purple_door_2). Then step 14: toggle purple_door_2 (unlocks it). Then step 15: gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1. Now, the agent is in front of yellow_door_1, which is unlocked. So this is the final step.

Now, let's verify all actions' preconditions:

Step 1: gotoobject green_box_2 room_4. Agent is in room_4, green_box_2 is there. Valid.

Step 2: pick green_box_2 room_4. Agent is in room_4, not holding anything. Valid.

Step 3: gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2. Agent in room_4, red_door_1 connects to room_2. Assuming no objects block the door. Valid.

Step 4: toggle red_door_1. Agent in front of red_door_1. Valid.

Step 5: gotoroom room_4 room_2 red_door_1. Door is unlocked. Valid.

Step 6: drop green_box_2 room_2. Agent is holding it, in room_2. Valid.

Step 7: gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1. Agent in room_2, door exists. Valid.

Step 8: toggle purple_door_1. Agent in front of it. Valid.

Step 9: gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1. Door unlocked. Valid.

Step 10: gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3. Agent in room_1. Valid.

Step 11: toggle yellow_door_1. Agent in front. Valid.

Step 12: gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1. Door unlocked. Valid.

Step 13: gotodoor purple_door_2 room_3 room_4. Agent in room_3. Valid.

Step 14: toggle purple_door_2. Agent in front. Valid.

Step 15: gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1. Agent in room_3. Valid.

This sequence satisfies all constraints and the final goal. Now, checking for optimality (shortest possible). Are there any redundant steps?

For example, after step 14 (toggle purple_door_2), the agent is in front of purple_door_2 in room_3. Then, step 15 moves them to yellow_door_1. Could they have gone directly from purple_door_2 to yellow_door_1 in room_3? Yes.

But the steps seem necessary. Each action is required to unlock doors, move between rooms, and satisfy constraints.

Final plan:

```
gotoobject green_box_2 room_4
pick green_box_2 room_4
gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2
toggle red_door_1
gotoroom room_4 room_2 red_door_1
drop green_box_2 room_2
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1
toggle purple_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3
toggle yellow_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1
gotodoor purple_door_2 room_3 room_4
toggle purple_door_2
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1
```
