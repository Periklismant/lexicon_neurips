Okay, let's see. I need to find a plan that gets the agent to a green door that's unlocked and they're in front of it. The initial state has all doors locked. So first, I need to unlock a green door. The green doors are green_door_1, green_door_2, and green_door_3. Let's see where they are.

Green_door_1 connects room_1 and room_2. Green_door_2 connects room_2 and room_4. Green_door_3 connects room_3 and room_4. The agent starts in room_1. The purple_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3 but it's purple and locked. So maybe the agent can go from room_1 to room_3 via purple_door_1, but it's locked. Wait, but to toggle a door, the agent needs to be in front of it. But to get in front of it, the door must not be blocked. Hmm.

Wait, the preconditions for "gotodoor d r1 r2" are that the agent is in a room connected by door d, and there's no object blocking the position in front of d in the current room. So first, check if any doors are blocked in room_1. In room_1, the objects are green_box_1, grey_ball_1, green_box_2. Are any of these blocking the doors? The doors in room_1 are green_door_1 (connecting to room_2) and purple_door_1 (connecting to room_3). Are the objects in room_1 blocking the positions in front of these doors?

Assuming that objects in a room might block the door positions unless specified otherwise. But the problem statement doesn't mention any objects blocking doors initially. Wait, the initial state doesn't state any door is blocked. So the agent can go to the doors in their current room as long as the door isn't blocked. Since the initial state doesn't mention any door being blocked, maybe the doors in room_1 (green_door_1 and purple_door_1) are not blocked. So the agent can go to either door in room_1.

But the problem is that all doors are locked. So even if the agent goes to a door, they can toggle it to unlock. Then, once unlocked, they can go through. But the goal is to have a green door that's unlocked and be in front of it. So the agent needs to unlock a green door and be in front of it. Let's see.

The agent is in room_1. The green doors available from room_1 are green_door_1 (to room_2) and maybe others. Let's list all green doors:

- green_door_1: connects room_1 and room_2 (locked)
- green_door_2: connects room_2 and room_4 (locked)
- green_door_3: connects room_3 and room_4 (locked)

So the agent is in room_1. Let's try the green_door_1 in room_1. To toggle it, the agent needs to be in front of it. So first, the agent can "gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_2". Then "toggle green_door_1". That would unlock it. Then, after that, the agent is in front of the green door, which is now unlocked. That would satisfy the goal: a green door (green_door_1) that's unlocked, and the agent is in front of it. So the plan would be:

1. gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_2
2. toggle green_door_1

But wait, after toggling, the door becomes unlocked. Then, the agent is still in front of the door. So the final state would be: in front of green_door_1, which is green and now unlocked. That meets the goal. But let's check the preconditions.

For step 1: the agent is in room_1. The door green_door_1 connects room_1 and room_2, so the agent is in a room connected by the door. Also, there's no object blocking the door's position. Since the initial state doesn't mention any blocking, this action is allowed. Then, after step 1, the agent is in front of green_door_1. Then step 2: toggle green_door_1. The preconditions for toggle are that the agent is in front of the door. So that's satisfied. Toggling a locked door will unlock it. So after step 2, green_door_1 is unlocked. The agent is still in front of it. So that's the goal.

So this plan should work. But wait, let me check if there are constraints. The problem mentions constraints, but the user didn't list any specific ones here. Wait, the problem statement says: "A valid plan for the abovementioned problem must abide by the following constraints:" but then there's nothing. Maybe there was a formatting error. But assuming there are no additional constraints beyond the initial problem, then the plan is two steps.

But maybe I'm missing something. Let me double-check. The initial state has the agent in room_1. All doors are locked. To unlock green_door_1, they can go to it (since it's in room_1 and not blocked), toggle it. That would unlock it. Then the agent is in front of a green door that's unlocked. That's the goal. So the plan is:

gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_2
toggle green_door_1

Yes. That's two actions. Optimal.
