Okay, let's tackle this planning problem step by step. The goal is to get in front of a green door that's unlocked. The constraints are a bit tricky, so I need to make sure all of them are satisfied throughout the plan. Let me start by understanding the initial state and the goal.

First, the initial state: I'm in room_1. There are green_box_1, grey_ball_1, and green_box_2 here. All doors are locked. The doors are green_door_1 (connects room_1 and room_2), purple_door_1 (connects room_1 and room_3), green_door_2 (connects room_2 and room_4), and green_door_3 (connects room_3 and room_4). The goal is to be in front of a green door that's unlocked. The constraints include needing to unlock green_door_1 at some point, but also relock it, and having held yellow_box_1 when green_door_1 is unlocked. Also, I need to be in room_2 at some point, hold green_box_1, and either be in front of yellow_box_1 or have purple_box_1 in room_4.

Let me outline the main steps:

1. Unlock a green door. The available green doors are green_door_1 (room_1-2), green_door_2 (room_2-4), green_door_3 (room_3-4). The goal is to have a green door unlocked and be in front of it. Since I'm in room_1, the closest green door is green_door_1. But it's locked. To unlock it, I need to toggle it. But to toggle, I need to be in front of it. But to get in front of it, I need to go to the door, which is possible only if the door isn't blocked. Wait, the precondition for "gotodoor d r1 r2" is that there's no object blocking the position in front of d in the current room. Are there any objects blocking doors in room_1? Let's see: room_1 has green_box_1, grey_ball_1, green_box_2. Are any of these blocking doors? The initial state doesn't mention any objects blocking doors. So maybe I can go to green_door_1. But first, I need to get in front of it. So "gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_2" would require that I'm in room_1 (which I am) and that there's no object blocking it. Assuming no blocking, then I can go to the door, toggle it to unlock. But wait, after unlocking, the door is unlocked, so then I can go through it. But the goal is to be in front of an unlocked green door. So maybe after unlocking green_door_1, I can stay in front of it. But the constraints also say that there must be a state where green_door_1 is not locked, and that when that happens, I must have held yellow_box_1 earlier. Wait, the constraint says: If green_door_1 is not locked in some state, then there must be an earlier state where I held yellow_box_1. So if I unlock green_door_1, I need to have held yellow_box_1 before that. But yellow_box_1 is in room_4. To get to room_4, I need to go through other doors. Let's see the path.

From room_1, the doors are to room_2 (green_door_1, locked) and room_3 (purple_door_1, locked). So both are locked. So I can't leave room_1 unless I unlock one of these doors. But to unlock a door, I need to be in front of it. So first, I need to go to a door, toggle it to unlock. Let's pick green_door_1. But to toggle it, I need to be in front of it. So first, go to green_door_1. Then toggle it. But according to the constraints, when I unlock green_door_1 (i.e., when it's not locked), I must have previously held yellow_box_1. But yellow_box_1 is in room_4. So how can I have held it before unlocking green_door_1? That seems impossible unless there's another path. Wait, maybe I need to use another door first. Let's see the other doors. Purple_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3. It's purple and locked. To unlock it, I need to be in front of it. But if I go to purple_door_1, toggle it, then I can go to room_3. From room_3, there's green_door_3 connecting to room_4. But green_door_3 is locked. So to unlock it, I need to toggle it. But again, how to get to room_4 to get the yellow_box_1.

This seems complicated. Let me think again. The constraints require that when green_door_1 is unlocked, I must have held yellow_box_1 before. So perhaps I need to first go through other doors to get to room_4, get the yellow_box_1, then come back to room_1, unlock green_door_1, then be in front of it.

But how to get to room_4? Let's see:

From room_1, doors are locked. So first, I need to unlock a door. Let's consider purple_door_1. If I can unlock that, I can go to room_3. Then in room_3, there's green_door_3 leading to room_4. But green_door_3 is green and locked. So I need to unlock it. To do that, I need to be in front of it. So let's try:

1. In room_1, go to purple_door_1 (gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_3). But wait, can I do that? The precondition for gotodoor is that I'm in a room connected by the door and no object is blocking. Since I'm in room_1 and purple_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3, I can go to the door. Then toggle it to unlock. Then go to room_3. Then in room_3, go to green_door_3 (connecting to room_4). Toggle it to unlock. Then go to room_4. Then pick up yellow_box_1. Then return to room_1 via the same path. Then unlock green_door_1, which would require having held yellow_box_1 earlier. But this path might work. Let's outline the steps:

- From room_1: gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_3 → now in front of purple_door_1
- toggle purple_door_1 → unlocks it
- gotoroom room_1 room_3 purple_door_1 → now in room_3
- Now, in room_3, need to go to green_door_3 (room_3-4). But green_door_3 is locked. So:
- gotodoor green_door_3 room_3 room_4 → in front of green_door_3
- toggle green_door_3 → unlock
- gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_3 → now in room_4
- Now, pick up yellow_box_1 in room_4: gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_4, then pick it up.
- Then, need to return to room_1. Let's see: from room_4, can go to room_2 via green_door_2 or room_3 via green_door_3. But green_door_2 connects room_2 and 4. So from room_4, green_door_2 is in room_4? Wait, the doors are in both rooms. Wait, to go from room_4 to room_2, use green_door_2. But green_door_2 is locked. Need to unlock it. But green_door_2 is green and locked. So maybe I can unlock it if I'm in room_4. Let me check the initial state: green_door_2 is connected to room_2 and 4, and it's locked. So in room_4, I can go to green_door_2 (gotodoor green_door_2 room_4 room_2), then toggle to unlock. Then go to room_2. Then from room_2, green_door_1 connects to room_1. But green_door_1 is locked. So need to go through room_2 to room_1 via green_door_1, but it's locked. Wait, but the plan requires that after getting yellow_box_1, I need to go back to room_1 to unlock green_door_1. Alternatively, maybe I can unlock green_door_1 from room_2 once I have yellow_box_1.

Wait, but the constraint says that when green_door_1 is unlocked (i.e., in some state), there must be a previous state where I held yellow_box_1. So if I unlock green_door_1 after picking up yellow_box_1, that's okay. So let's see:

After picking up yellow_box_1 in room_4, I can go to room_2 via green_door_2 (unlocking it first). Then from room_2, go to green_door_1 (room_2's side), toggle it to unlock. Then be in front of green_door_1 (now unlocked), satisfying the goal. But let's check the steps:

1. Unlock purple_door_1 (from room_1)
2. Go to room_3
3. Unlock green_door_3 (from room_3)
4. Go to room_4
5. Pick up yellow_box_1 (must do this before unlocking green_door_1)
6. Then go to room_2 via green_door_2 (unlock it)
7. From room_2, go to green_door_1 (room_2 side)
8. Toggle green_door_1 to unlock (now, since we have yellow_box_1, the constraint is satisfied)
9. Now, be in front of green_door_1 (unlocked), which meets the goal.

But also, the constraints require that green_door_1 is locked in at least one state. So maybe we need to lock it again after unlocking? Wait, the goal is to have a door d (green, in front of, unlocked). So once we unlock green_door_1 and are in front of it, that's the goal. But the constraints say:

- Must have a state where green_door_1 is not locked (achieved when we toggle it)
- If green_door_1 is not locked in a state, then earlier state must have held yellow_box_1 (which we do, since we picked it up in room_4)
- Must have a state where green_door_1 is locked (which is initially true, but after we unlock it, maybe we have to relock it? But the initial state counts as a state where it's locked. So perhaps the initial state satisfies that constraint. Wait, the problem says "the following expression must hold in at least one state: green_door_1 is locked". The initial state has green_door_1 locked, so that's already satisfied. So that constraint is met from the start. So no need to relock it.

Other constraints:

- The expression "you are in room_2" must hold in at least one state. So the plan must pass through room_2.

- The expression "you are holding green_box_1" must hold in at least one state. So I need to pick up green_box_1 at some point.

- The expression "At least one of: in front of yellow_box_1 or purple_box_1 in room_4". So either I go in front of yellow_box_1 (which is in room_4) or move purple_box_1 to room_4. But purple_box_1 is initially in room_3. To move it to room_4, I need to pick it up in room_3, carry it through green_door_3 to room_4 and drop it. But that would require more steps. Alternatively, just going in front of yellow_box_1 in room_4 would satisfy the constraint. Since we need to pick up yellow_box_1 anyway, maybe when we gotoobject yellow_box_1 in room_4, that satisfies the "in front of" part. So that's covered.

So the steps would be:

1. In room_1: gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_3
2. toggle purple_door_1 (unlocks it)
3. gotoroom room_1 room_3 purple_door_1 (now in room_3)
4. In room_3: gotodoor green_door_3 room_3 room_4
5. toggle green_door_3 (unlocks it)
6. gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_3 (now in room_4)
7. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_4 (now in front of it)
8. pick yellow_box_1 room_4 (now holding it)
9. Then, need to get to room_2. From room_4, the doors are green_door_2 (connects to room_2) and green_door_3 (connects to room_3). But green_door_2 is locked. So we need to unlock it.
10. gotodoor green_door_2 room_4 room_2 (in room_4)
11. toggle green_door_2 (unlocks it)
12. gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_2 (now in room_2) → this satisfies the "you are in room_2" constraint
13. Now, in room_2, need to unlock green_door_1 (connects to room_1)
14. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_1 (in room_2)
15. toggle green_door_1 (unlocks it) → now green_door_1 is unlocked. Since we're holding yellow_box_1, the constraint is satisfied (earlier state when we picked it up)
16. Now, we are in front of green_door_1 (room_2 side), which is green and unlocked. So the goal is achieved. But wait, the goal is to be in front of a green door that's unlocked. So this action (toggle) would leave us in front of green_door_1, which is now unlocked. So the final state after step 15 is that we're in front of green_door_1, which is unlocked.

But wait, the toggle action's effect is to unlock if it's locked. So after step 15, green_door_1 is unlocked. And we are in front of it. So that satisfies the goal.

But also, the constraints:

- "you are holding green_box_1" must happen. We haven't done that yet. So we need to include picking up green_box_1 at some point. Oh right! That's a problem. So in the current plan, we have to pick up green_box_1.

So when can we do that? We need to hold green_box_1, which is in room_1. So we need to go back to room_1 at some point. Let's see. After step 15, we are in room_2, in front of green_door_1 (unlocked). So we can go through green_door_1 to room_1. Then, pick up green_box_1.

Wait, but the goal is just to be in front of an unlocked green door. So after step 15, we're already in front of green_door_1 (unlocked). So the goal is achieved. But the constraint requires that "you are holding green_box_1" in at least one state. So the current plan doesn't include that. So I need to add steps to pick up green_box_1.

So perhaps after step 15, we can go back to room_1, pick up green_box_1, then return to room_2 and toggle the door again? But that might complicate things. Alternatively, after unlocking green_door_1, go to room_1, pick up green_box_1, then come back to room_2 and be in front of the door again. Let's try:

15. toggle green_door_1 (now unlocked)
16. gotoroom room_2 room_1 green_door_1 (go to room_1)
17. gotoobject green_box_1 room_1 (in front of it)
18. pick green_box_1 room_1 (now holding it, satisfying the constraint)
19. Then, drop it somewhere? Or maybe just hold it. But we need to be in front of the green door again. So after step 18, we need to go back to room_2 and get in front of green_door_1.

But that adds more steps. Alternatively, maybe after step 15 (unlocking green_door_1 and being in front of it in room_2), we can proceed to room_1, pick up green_box_1, then go back to room_2 and be in front of the door again. Let's see:

After step 15:

16. gotoroom room_2 room_1 green_door_1 (now in room_1)
17. gotoobject green_box_1 room_1
18. pick green_box_1 room_1 (now holding it)
19. Then, need to go back to room_2 to be in front of green_door_1 again. So:

19. gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_2
20. toggle green_door_1 (lock it again? No, the goal is to have it unlocked. Wait, but the goal is to have it unlocked and be in front of it. So perhaps after step 18, we need to go back to room_2 and be in front of green_door_1 again. But since green_door_1 is already unlocked, we can go through:

19. gotoroom room_1 room_2 green_door_1 (since it's unlocked)
20. Now in room_2. Then goto door green_door_1 again.

But this adds more steps and increases the plan length. Alternatively, maybe pick up green_box_1 earlier in the plan. Let's think.

Wait, perhaps after step 3 (when we are in room_3), we can return to room_1 to pick up green_box_1. But that would require going back through purple_door_1. Let's see:

Alternative approach:

1. In room_1: gotoobject green_box_1 room_1 (since I'm in room_1)
2. pick green_box_1 room_1 (now holding it) → satisfies the constraint
3. drop it somewhere? Or keep holding it. But then, need to proceed to unlock doors.

But if I pick up green_box_1, then I can't pick up yellow_box_1 later unless I drop it. But the constraint for green_door_1 requires holding yellow_box_1 before unlocking it. So maybe I can't pick up green_box_1 until after I've held yellow_box_1. But this complicates things.

Alternatively, after unlocking green_door_1, go to room_1, pick up green_box_1, then return to room_2 and be in front of green_door_1 again.

But this would require:

After step 15 (toggle green_door_1 to unlock), then:

16. gotoroom room_2 room_1 green_door_1 (enter room_1)
17. gotoobject green_box_1 room_1
18. pick green_box_1 room_1 → constraint satisfied
19. drop green_box_1 room_1 (if needed, but maybe not necessary)
20. Then go back to room_2 via green_door_1 (which is unlocked)
21. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_1 (now in front of it)
22. Now, the goal is achieved: in front of green_door_1 (green, unlocked). But the constraint for "you are holding green_box_1" is satisfied in step 18.

This adds steps but ensures all constraints are met. But this makes the plan longer. However, the problem requires an optimal plan (shortest possible). So perhaps there's a way to pick up green_box_1 earlier without adding too many steps.

Wait, maybe after unlocking purple_door_1 and going to room_3, then coming back to room_1 to get green_box_1. Let's see:

Original steps modified:

1. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_3
2. toggle purple_door_1 (unlock)
3. gotoroom room_1 room_3 purple_door_1 (now in room_3)
4. gotodoor green_door_3 room_3 room_4
5. toggle green_door_3 (unlock)
6. gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_3 (now in room_4)
7. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_4
8. pick yellow_box_1 room_4
9. Now, return to room_3 via green_door_3 (unlocked)
10. gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_3 (now in room_3)
11. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_1
12. toggle purple_door_1 (if needed, but it's already unlocked)
13. gotoroom room_3 room_1 purple_door_1 (back to room_1)
14. Now, in room_1, gotoobject green_box_1 room_1
15. pick green_box_1 room_1 (constraint satisfied)
16. drop green_box_1 room_1 (to free hands)
17. Then proceed to unlock green_door_1 as before.

But this adds a lot of steps. Let me count the steps. This approach would have more steps, making the plan longer. The optimal plan needs to be as short as possible.

Alternative idea: when returning from room_4 to room_2, then to room_1, pick up green_box_1, then go back to room_2 and unlock green_door_1. Let's see:

After step 12 (in room_2), proceed to room_1 via green_door_1 (unlock it first? No, because green_door_1 is locked initially. Wait, in the previous steps, after unlocking green_door_2 and getting to room_2, green_door_1 is still locked. So to get to room_1 from room_2, we need to unlock green_door_1. But that requires having held yellow_box_1, which we have. So perhaps:

After step 12 (in room_2), gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_1 (step 13)
14. toggle green_door_1 (unlock, now it's unlocked. But we are holding yellow_box_1, which satisfies the constraint)
15. Now, go to room_1 (gotoroom room_2 room_1 green_door_1)
16. Now in room_1, gotoobject green_box_1
17. pick green_box_1 (now holding it, constraint satisfied)
18. drop it if needed, but perhaps not necessary. Then, need to be in front of green_door_1 again. So go back to room_2:
19. gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_2 (since we are in room_1)
20. toggle green_door_1 (lock it again? But the goal requires it to be unlocked. Wait, the goal is to be in front of a green door that's unlocked. So after step 14, green_door_1 is unlocked. When we go back to room_2 in step 19, we need to be in front of green_door_1 again. But step 19 is gotodoor, which brings us in front of it. Then, we are in front of green_door_1 which is unlocked. So that satisfies the goal. So steps would be:

1. goto purple_door_1 (room1)
2. toggle (unlock)
3. go to room3
4. goto green_door3 (room3)
5. toggle (unlock)
6. go to room4
7. goto yellow_box_1
8. pick it
9. go to green_door2 (room4)
10. toggle (unlock)
11. go to room2
12. goto green_door1 (room2)
13. toggle (unlock)
14. Now, in front of green_door1 (unlocked). This meets the goal.
But we haven't picked green_box_1 yet. So we need to add steps here.

So after step 13, perhaps:

14. gotoroom room2 to room1 via green_door1
15. goto green_box_1
16. pick it (now holding it)
17. drop it (if needed)
18. go back to room2
19. goto green_door1 again.

But this adds steps. Alternatively, can we pick up green_box_1 before unlocking green_door_1? Let's see:

But to unlock green_door_1, we need to have held yellow_box_1 before. So if we pick green_box_1 after unlocking green_door_1, but before toggling it, that's not possible. Wait, no. The constraint says that if green_door_1 is unlocked in any state, there must be an earlier state where we held yellow_box_1. So if we unlock green_door_1 in step 13, we have already held yellow_box_1 in step 8. So that's okay. Then, after unlocking green_door_1, we can go to room1 and pick up green_box_1.

But then, the plan would have:

13. toggle green_door_1 (unlock)
14. gotoroom room2 room1 green_door_1 (now in room1)
15. gotoobject green_box_1 room1
16. pick green_box_1 room1 (constraint satisfied)
17. drop green_box_1 room1 (optional, but if we need to be holding it in some state, we can just keep it. Wait, the constraint is that "you are holding green_box_1" must be true in at least one state. So step 16 satisfies that. So we can proceed to drop it or not. But after picking it up, maybe we need to drop it to proceed. But the goal is to be in front of a door, so holding it doesn't matter for the goal. So perhaps:

17. drop green_box_1 room1 (but where? We need to be in front of an empty spot. So maybe after picking, we can drop it.

But this is getting complicated. Let me try to write out the full plan with all constraints:

Steps:

1. gotoobject green_box_1 room_1 → pre: in room_1, possible. But wait, after this, we can pick it up. But then we need to hold it. But later steps require holding yellow_box_1. So this may not be possible. So maybe this is not the right approach.

Alternative plan:

- First, unlock purple_door_1, go to room3, unlock green_door_3, go to room4, pick yellow_box_1, then go to room3, back to room1, pick green_box_1, then go to room2 via green_door_2 (unlock it), then unlock green_door_1, being in front of it.

But this involves a lot of steps. Let's outline:

1. In room1: gotodoor purple_door_1 room1 room3
2. toggle → unlock
3. gotoroom room1 room3 → now in room3
4. gotodoor green_door3 room3 room4
5. toggle → unlock
6. gotoroom room3 room4 → now in room4
7. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room4
8. pick → holding yellow_box_1
9. gotodoor green_door3 room4 room3
10. toggle → lock? No, we need to keep it unlocked to return. Or maybe not, since after unlocking, it's unlocked. So step 5 toggled it from locked to unlocked. Toggling again would lock it. So better not to toggle again. So just go through.

11. gotoroom room4 room3 green_door3 → back to room3
12. gotodoor purple_door_1 room3 room1
13. toggle → unlock (already unlocked, so toggling would lock it. Wait, initial state: purple_door_1 is locked. After step 2, it's unlocked. So step 13 would toggle it to locked again. That's bad. So need to avoid that. So instead of toggling again, just go through.

12. gotoroom room3 room1 purple_door_1 → back to room1
13. Now in room1: gotoobject green_box_1 room1
14. pick → now holding green_box_1 (constraint satisfied)
15. drop → need to be in front of empty spot. So after picking, we need to gotoempty.
16. gotoempty → to drop. Then drop.
17. Then, proceed to unlock green_door_1. But how? To unlock green_door_1 from room1's side, but green_door_1 is locked. So:

17. gotodoor green_door_1 room1 room2
18. toggle → unlock (now unlocked)
19. Now, in front of green_door_1 (unlocked), which satisfies the goal.

But wait, the constraint says that when green_door_1 is unlocked (step 18), there must be an earlier state where I held yellow_box_1. Which I did in step 8. So that's okay.

Also, the constraint that green_door_1 is locked in some state: initial state is locked, step 18 unlocks it, so the initial state counts.

But this plan requires:

- Unlocking purple_door_1 (steps 1-2)
- Going to room3, unlocking green_door_3 (steps4-5)
- Going to room4, picking yellow_box_1 (steps7-8)
- Returning to room1 (steps11-12)
- Picking green_box_1 (steps13-14)
- Dropping it (steps15-16)
- Unlocking green_door_1 (steps17-18)

Then, the goal is achieved in step18: in front of green_door_1 (unlocked, green). Also, the constraints:

- "you are in room_2" must be achieved. But in this plan, I never go to room_2. So that's a problem. So this plan is invalid because it doesn't satisfy the "you are in room_2" constraint.

Ah, right. So the plan must include being in room_2 at some point. So how to achieve that.

So back to the earlier approach where we go to room_2.

Alternative plan:

1. Unlock purple_door_1 (room1)
2. Go to room3
3. Unlock green_door_3 (room3)
4. Go to room4
5. Pick yellow_box_1
6. Unlock green_door_2 (room4)
7. Go to room2
8. Unlock green_door_1 (room2)
9. Be in front of green_door_1 (unlocked)
10. Then go to room1 to pick green_box_1 and come back.

But this would require:

After step8 (unlock green_door_1), we are in room2, in front of green_door_1. Then:

9. gotoroom room2 room1 green_door_1 → in room1
10. gotoobject green_box_1 room1
11. pick → holding green_box_1 (constraint satisfied)
12. drop → need to drop somewhere
13. gotoroom room1 room2 green_door_1 → back to room2
14. gotodoor green_door_1 room2 room1 → in front of it again.

But this adds steps. So the full plan would be:

1. gotodoor purple_door_1 room1 room3
2. toggle → unlock
3. gotoroom room1 room3 purple_door_1
4. gotodoor green_door_3 room3 room4
5. toggle → unlock
6. gotoroom room3 room4 green_door_3
7. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room4
8. pick yellow_box_1 room4
9. gotodoor green_door_2 room4 room2
10. toggle → unlock
11. gotoroom room4 room2 green_door_2 → now in room2 (constraint satisfied)
12. gotodoor green_door_1 room2 room1
13. toggle → unlock (now green_door_1 is unlocked)
14. Now in front of green_door_1 (unlocked, green). Goal achieved.
15. Then, need to handle green_box_1: go to room1:
16. gotoroom room2 room1 green_door_1
17. gotoobject green_box_1 room1
18. pick green_box_1 room1 → constraint satisfied
19. drop green_box_1 room1 (if needed)
20. Return to room2:
21. gotoroom room1 room2 green_door_1
22. gotodoor green_door_1 room2 room1 → now in front of it again.

But this plan's steps up to step14 achieve the goal, but steps15-22 are extra. However, the constraint for green_box_1 requires that "you are holding green_box_1" in at least one state, which is done in step18. So the plan must include steps1-18. But the goal is achieved at step14. So after step14, the goal is met, but the constraints require that we also pick up green_box_1. So the plan must include that, even if it's after the goal is achieved. But the problem states that the goal must be brought about, but the constraints must hold in at least one state during the plan.

So the plan can continue after achieving the goal to satisfy other constraints. However, the optimal plan is the shortest possible. So perhaps there's a way to pick up green_box_1 before achieving the goal.

Let me think: maybe after step11 (in room2), before unlocking green_door_1, go to room1 via green_door_1 (but it's locked). No, can't. So after unlocking green_door_1 in step13, we can go to room1, pick green_box_1, then come back to room2 to be in front of green_door_1 again. But this adds steps.

Alternatively, after step11 (in room2), we can go to room1 via green_door_1 once it's unlocked. So the steps would be:

1. ... (steps1-11 as before)
12. In room2, unlock green_door_1 (steps12-13: gotodoor and toggle)
13. Now in front of green_door_1, unlocked. Goal achieved. But need to pick green_box_1. So then:

14. gotoroom room2 room1 green_door_1 → enter room1
15. gotoobject green_box_1 room1
16. pick green_box_1 room1 → constraint satisfied
17. drop green_box_1 room1 (optional)
18. gotoroom room1 room2 green_door_1 → back to room2
19. gotodoor green_door_1 room2 room1 → in front of it again.

But this makes the plan longer. The optimal plan requires the least steps. So perhaps there's a way to pick up green_box_1 while going to room2.

Wait, another idea: after unlocking green_door_1 and being in front of it (step13), can I go to room1, pick up green_box_1, then come back to room2 and be in front of green_door_1 again. But this adds steps. However, maybe the plan can be written as:

Steps:

1. gotodoor purple_door_1 room1 room3
2. toggle purple_door_1
3. gotoroom room1 room3 purple_door_1
4. gotodoor green_door_3 room3 room4
5. toggle green_door_3
6. gotoroom room3 room4 green_door_3
7. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room4
8. pick yellow_box_1 room4
9. gotodoor green_door_2 room4 room2
10. toggle green_door_2
11. gotoroom room4 room2 green_door_2
12. gotodoor green_door_1 room2 room1
13. toggle green_door_1
14. gotoroom room2 room1 green_door_1
15. gotoobject green_box_1 room1
16. pick green_box_1 room1
17. drop green_box_1 room1
18. gotoroom room1 room2 green_door_1
19. gotodoor green_door_1 room2 room1

But step19 puts us in front of green_door_1 (unlocked), which meets the goal. So the final action is step19. But the plan includes all necessary steps to meet the constraints. Let's check:

- "you are in room_2" happens in step11 and step18.
- "you are holding green_box_1" in step16.
- "At least one of in front of yellow_box_1 or purple_box_1 in room4": we were in front of yellow_box_1 in step7.
- The green_door_1 is locked in the initial state (constraint met), and unlocked in step13.
- When green_door_1 is unlocked in step13, we had yellow_box_1 in step8 (earlier).
- The constraint that if green_door_1 is locked in some state, then we must be holding yellow_box_1 in that state or later. The initial state has green_door_1 locked, but we are not holding yellow_box_1 then. So this violates the constraint. Wait, no: the constraint says if green_door_1 is locked in state s, then in s or later, we must be holding yellow_box_1. In the initial state, we are not holding yellow_box_1. So after step8, when we pick it up, any state after that where green_door_1 is locked must have us holding yellow_box_1. But in the initial state, green_door_1 is locked, and we are not holding yellow_box_1. This violates the constraint. So the plan as outlined is invalid.

Oh no! This is a problem. The constraint says that if green_door_1 is locked in some state s, then in s or a subsequent state, we must be holding yellow_box_1. The initial state has green_door_1 locked, and we are not holding yellow_box_1. So unless we pick up yellow_box_1 before or during the initial state (which we can't), this constraint is violated. Therefore, the only way to satisfy this is to ensure that after any state where green_door_1 is locked, we hold yellow_box_1 in that state or later. So the initial state is a problem unless we pick up yellow_box_1 later. So in the initial state, s0: green_door_1 is locked. Therefore, there must be a state after s0 where we are holding yellow_box_1. So as long as we pick up yellow_box_1 at some point, the constraint is satisfied. Because even though s0 is a state where green_door_1 is locked, we later pick up yellow_box_1, so in s0 and subsequent states until we pick it up, we are not holding it, but after we pick it up, any state where green_door_1 is locked (like if we relock it) would require holding it then or later. But the initial state is s0: green_door_1 is locked, and we are not holding yellow_box_1. So this violates the constraint unless there's a state after s0 where we are holding yellow_box_1, which there is (step8). But the constraint says that for any state where green_door_1 is locked, the agent must hold yellow_box_1 in that state or a later state. So in s0, green_door_1 is locked, and in a later state (step8), we hold yellow_box_1. So that's okay. So the constraint is satisfied.

Another point: when we unlock green_door_1 in step13, we have already picked up yellow_box_1 in step8. So the constraint that "if green_door_1 is not locked in a state, there's an earlier state holding yellow_box_1" is met.

Now, the problem with the initial plan is that after unlocking green_door_1, we have to go to room1 to pick up green_box_1, which adds steps. But the optimal plan must be as short as possible. Is there a way to combine steps?

Wait, perhaps after step13 (unlocking green_door_1), we are in front of it in room2. The goal is met. The other constraints are:

- "you are in room_2" is satisfied in step11.
- "you are holding green_box_1" needs to be done. So maybe after achieving the goal, we can proceed to pick green_box_1 even though it's not required for the goal, but necessary for the constraint. But this increases the plan length. So the minimal plan would include the steps to pick green_box_1.

But wait, perhaps there's a way to pick green_box_1 before unlocking green_door_1. For example:

After step11 (in room2), we can go to room1 via green_door_1 once it's unlocked. But green_door_1 is locked until step13. So we need to unlock it first. So steps:

1-13 as before (unlock green_door_1 in step13)
14. gotoroom room2 room1 green_door_1 (now in room1)
15. gotoobject green_box_1 room1
16. pick green_box_1 room1
17. drop green_box_1 room1 (if needed)
18. gotoroom room1 room2 green_door_1 (back to room2)
19. gotodoor green_door_1 room2 room1 (now in front of it)

This results in 19 steps, but the goal is achieved at step13, but the constraints require steps16 and step11. So the minimal plan must include these steps.

But maybe there's a shorter path. Let's think differently: can we pick up green_box_1 before going to room2?

For example, after unlocking purple_door_1 and going to room3, then returning to room1 to pick up green_box_1, then proceed to room2. Let's see:

1. gotodoor purple_door_1 room1 room3
2. toggle → unlock
3. gotoroom room1 room3 purple_door_1
4. gotodoor green_door_3 room3 room4
5. toggle → unlock
6. gotoroom room3 room4 green_door_3
7. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room4
8. pick yellow_box_1 room4
9. gotoroom room4 room3 green_door_3
10. gotoroom room3 room1 purple_door_1
11. gotoobject green_box_1 room1
12. pick green_box_1 room1 → constraint met
13. drop green_box_1 room1
14. gotodoor green_door_1 room1 room2
15. toggle → unlock (now green_door_1 is unlocked)
16. gotoroom room1 room2 green_door_1 → now in room2 (constraint met)
17. gotodoor green_door_1 room2 room1 → in front of it (unlocked)

This plan has 17 steps. But in step15, when we toggle green_door_1, we are in room1, so we need to be in front of green_door_1. So steps14 and 15:

14. gotodoor green_door_1 room1 room2 (in room1)
15. toggle → unlock (now green_door_1 is unlocked)
16. gotoroom room1 room2 green_door_1 → room2
17. gotodoor green_door_1 room2 room1 → in front of it, now in room2.

This makes step17 the final step where we are in front of green_door_1 (unlocked). So the goal is achieved at step17. The constraints:

- "you are in room_2" is step16 and 17.
- "holding green_box_1" is step12.
- "in front of yellow_box_1" is step7.
- The door constraints are met.

But this plan has more steps than the previous one. So which is shorter?

Original plan with unlocking green_door_1 in room2 and then picking green_box_1 would be:

Steps 1-13: 13 steps to unlock green_door_1 and be in front of it.

Then steps14-19 to pick green_box_1 and return: total 19 steps.

But this alternative plan has 17 steps and achieves all constraints. But perhaps there's a way to optimize further.

Another idea: After step8 (holding yellow_box_1 in room4), instead of going back to room3 and room1, perhaps go directly to room2 via green_door_2 (unlock it), then to room2, unlock green_door_1, and then go to room1 to get green_box_1. Let's outline:

1. gotodoor purple_door_1 room1 room3
2. toggle
3. gotoroom room1 room3
4. gotodoor green_door_3 room3 room4
5. toggle
6. gotoroom room3 room4
7. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room4
8. pick
9. gotodoor green_door_2 room4 room2
10. toggle → unlock
11. gotoroom room4 room2 → now in room2
12. gotodoor green_door_1 room2 room1
13. toggle → unlock
14. gotoroom room2 room1 green_door_1 → room1
15. gotoobject green_box_1 room1
16. pick → constraint met
17. drop → optional
18. gotoroom room1 room2 green_door_1
19. gotodoor green_door_1 room2 room1 → front of door.

This is 19 steps. But maybe we can avoid some steps.

After step13 (unlock green_door_1), we are in front of it in room2. The goal is achieved here. Then, to pick green_box_1, we need to go to room1 and come back. But this adds steps.

Alternative idea: After step13, we are in front of green_door_1 (room2 side), which is unlocked. The goal is met. Then, we can proceed to room1 to pick green_box_1, but that's extra steps. However, the constraint requires that "you are holding green_box_1" in at least one state. So even if we do that after the goal is achieved, it's still necessary. So the minimal plan would be to achieve the goal first, then pick green_box_1. But since the problem requires the plan to bring about the goal, the steps after achieving the goal are still part of the plan. So the plan must include all necessary steps to meet all constraints, even if they are after the goal is achieved.

But the optimal plan requires the shortest possible. So perhaps there's a way to pick green_box_1 earlier.

Wait, in the initial state, green_box_1 is in room1. So perhaps after step1 (unlocking purple_door_1), go to room3, then return to room1 to pick green_box_1 before proceeding to room4. Let's see:

1. gotodoor purple_door_1 room1 room3
2. toggle → unlock
3. gotoroom room1 room3
4. gotoroom room3 room1 purple_door_1 → back to room1
5. gotoobject green_box_1 room1
6. pick → holding it (constraint met)
7. drop → need to drop to pick yellow_box_1 later
8. gotodoor purple_door_1 room1 room3
9. toggle → lock (but need to unlock again)
10. gotoroom room1 room3
11. gotodoor green_door_3 room3 room4
12. toggle → unlock
13. gotoroom room3 room4
14. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room4
15. pick → now holding yellow_box_1
16. ... and so on.

This adds too many steps and complicates the plan. Not optimal.

Another approach: Since the constraint for green_box_1 is to hold it in at least one state, maybe we can pick it up after unlocking green_door_1 and before toggling it. But no, because we need to be holding yellow_box_1 when we unlock green_door_1. So the order must be: pick yellow_box_1 → unlock green_door_1 → pick green_box_1.

But after unlocking green_door_1, we can pick green_box_1 in room1. So perhaps:

After step13 (unlocking green_door_1), then go to room1 and pick it up. But this requires steps.

But the optimal plan must be the shortest. Let's think again.

The minimal plan would have to include:

- Unlock purple_door_1, go to room3.

- Unlock green_door_3, go to room4.

- Pick yellow_box_1.

- Unlock green_door_2, go to room2.

- Unlock green_door_1, now in front of it (goal achieved).

- Pick green_box_1 in room1.

But to pick green_box_1, we need to go to room1 after unlocking green_door_1.

So steps:

1. gotodoor purple_door_1 room1 room3
2. toggle
3. gotoroom room1 room3
4. gotodoor green_door_3 room3 room4
5. toggle
6. gotoroom room3 room4
7. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room4
8. pick
9. gotodoor green_door_2 room4 room2
10. toggle
11. gotoroom room4 room2
12. gotodoor green_door_1 room2 room1
13. toggle
14. gotoroom room2 room1 green_door_1
15. gotoobject green_box_1 room1
16. pick

This is 16 steps. The goal is achieved at step13 (in front of green_door_1, unlocked). Then steps14-16 are to pick green_box_1. But step14 is moving to room1, step15 is going to the box, step16 is picking it. So the plan is 16 steps. But is there a way to pick green_box_1 before step14?

No, because until green_door_1 is unlocked, we can't get back to room1 from room2. So after unlocking green_door_1, we can go to room1 to pick green_box_1.

But in this plan, the goal is achieved at step13, and the constraints are all met:

- green_door_1 is unlocked in step13.

- yellow_box_1 was picked in step8, before step13.

- green_door_1 was locked in the initial state.

- "you are in room_2" in step11.

- "you are holding green_box_1" in step16.

- "in front of yellow_box_1" in step7.

So the plan is valid, but it's 16 steps. Can we make it shorter?

Alternative idea: After step11 (in room2), can we pick green_box_1 without going to room1? No, because green_box_1 is in room1. So we have to go to room1.

Wait, after step13 (unlock green_door_1), we are in front of it in room2. Then:

14. gotoroom room2 room1 green_door_1 → room1
15. gotoobject green_box_1 room1 → in front of it
16. pick → holding green_box_1
17. drop → optional
18. gotoroom room1 room2 green_door_1 → back to room2
19. gotodoor green_door_1 room2 room1 → in front of it again.

But the goal is achieved at step13. The steps after are for constraints, but the problem requires the plan to achieve the goal and satisfy all constraints. So the plan must include these steps. However, the optimal plan is the shortest possible. So perhaps the minimal number of steps is 19. But I need to check if there's a shorter way.

Alternatively, perhaps after step13 (unlock green_door_1), being in front of it in room2 satisfies the goal. Then, to meet the green_box_1 constraint, we can proceed to room1, pick it up, and drop it, which would add 5 steps (steps14-18). But maybe there's a way to combine steps.

Wait, after step13: in front of green_door_1 (room2 side), now unlocked. Then:

14. gotoroom room2 room1 green_door_1 → in room1
15. gotoobject green_box_1 room1 → in front of it
16. pick → holding it (constraint met)
17. gotoempty → to drop
18. drop → now hands free
19. gotoroom room1 room2 green_door_1 → back to room2
20. gotodoor green_door_1 room2 room1 → in front of it.

So total steps 20. But this is getting too long. Perhaps there's a way to optimize.

Wait, maybe after step13, we can just go to room1, pick green_box_1, and then the plan ends. The goal is achieved in step13, and the constraint for green_box_1 is met in step16. So steps1-16:

1. gotodoor purple_door_1 room1 room3
2. toggle
3. gotoroom room1 room3
4. gotodoor green_door_3 room3 room4
5. toggle
6. gotoroom room3 room4
7. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room4
8. pick
9. gotodoor green_door_2 room4 room2
10. toggle
11. gotoroom room4 room2
12. gotodoor green_door_1 room2 room1
13. toggle
14. gotoroom room2 room1 green_door_1
15. gotoobject green_box_1 room1
16. pick

The goal is achieved at step13. The constraint for green_box_1 is met at step16. The plan must include all steps up to step16. So this is 16 steps. But the goal is achieved at step13. The remaining steps are to meet the constraints. But according to the problem statement, the plan must bring about the goal and satisfy all constraints. So even if the goal is achieved earlier, the constraints must be met in the plan's states, which includes steps after the goal is achieved.

But the problem requires an optimal plan, i.e., the shortest possible. So perhaps there's a way to achieve all constraints and the goal in fewer steps.

Another observation: The constraint "At least one of: you are in front of yellow_box_1 or purple_box_1 is in room4". Since purple_box_1 is initially in room3, and we are in front of yellow_box_1 in step7, this condition is satisfied in step7. So no need to move purple_box_1.

Now, the only remaining constraint is "you are holding green_box_1" and "you are in room_2".

So, to optimize:

After step11 (in room2), we can go to room1 via green_door_1 once it's unlocked, pick green_box_1, and return to room2 to be in front of the door.

But how to minimize steps:

Steps:

1. goto purple_door_1 (room1)
2. toggle
3. go to room3
4. goto green_door_3 (room3)
5. toggle
6. go to room4
7. goto yellow_box_1
8. pick
9. goto green_door_2 (room4)
10. toggle
11. go to room2 (constraint met)
12. goto green_door_1 (room2)
13. toggle → unlock (goal achieved)
14. go to room1 via green_door_1
15. goto green_box_1
16. pick → constraint met
17. go back to room2 via green_door_1
18. goto green_door_1 (room2 side)

This is 18 steps. But step17 and 18 are needed to return to front of the door. But after step13, the goal is achieved, so steps14-18 are for constraints. However, the problem requires that the plan brings about the goal and satisfies all constraints. So these steps are necessary.

But maybe after step13, the plan can end, and the constraints are already met. Let's check:

- "you are in room_2" is met in step11.

- "you are holding green_box_1" is not met yet. So steps after step13 are needed to pick green_box_1.

But this is getting too long. Maybe there's a different approach altogether.

Alternative plan:

- Use the green_door_1 first. But it's locked. To unlock it, need to toggle it, which requires being in front of it. But to be in front of it, need to have no objects blocking. So in room1, can I go to green_door_1?

Yes. Because the precondition for gotodoor is that you are in a room connected by the door and no object is blocking. So:

1. gotodoor green_door_1 room1 room2
2. toggle → unlock (but need to have held yellow_box_1 before. But this is impossible because yellow_box_1 is in room4. So this violates the constraint. So can't do this first.

Thus, the initial approach remains the only feasible path.

After considering all possible paths, the shortest valid plan seems to be:

1. Go to purple_door_1 in room1.
2. Unlock it.
3. Go to room3.
4. Go to green_door_3.
5. Unlock it.
6. Go to room4.
7. Go to yellow_box_1.
8. Pick it.
9. Go to green_door_2 in room4.
10. Unlock it.
11. Go to room2.
12. Go to green_door_1 in room2.
13. Unlock it (now in front of green_door_1, unlocked).
14. Go to room1.
15. Go to green_box_1.
16. Pick it.

This is 16 steps. But after step13, the goal is achieved. Steps14-16 are for picking green_box_1 to meet the constraint. The plan must include these steps.

But the problem requires that the plan brings about the goal and satisfies all constraints. So the plan must include all necessary steps.

Another way to pick green_box_1 is after step13, while still holding yellow_box_1. But you can't pick green_box_1 while holding another object. So you need to drop yellow_box_1 first.

But that would require:

After step8, holding yellow_box_1.

Then, after step13 (unlock green_door_1), drop yellow_box_1 in room2.

Then go to room1, pick green_box_1.

But this adds more steps.

Alternatively, after step13, in front of green_door_1 (room2), drop yellow_box_1 there, then go to room1 and pick green_box_1.

But this complicates things.

Another idea: After step13, drop yellow_box_1 in room2, then go to room1 to pick green_box_1, then come back.

But this would require:

13. toggle green_door_1 (unlock)
14. drop yellow_box_1 room2 → need to be in front of an empty spot. So gotoempty in room2.
15. gotoempty room2
16. drop yellow_box_1 room2
17. gotoroom room2 room1 green_door_1
18. gotoobject green_box_1 room1
19. pick green_box_1
20. gotoroom room1 room2 green_door_1
21. gotodoor green_door_1 room2 room1 → front of door.

This adds even more steps. So this approach is not optimal.

Given all this, the minimal plan would be 16 steps as outlined earlier. But I need to verify if all constraints are met.

Final plan steps:

1. gotodoor purple_door_1 room1 room3
2. toggle purple_door_1
3. gotoroom room1 room3 purple_door_1
4. gotodoor green_door_3 room3 room4
5. toggle green_door_3
6. gotoroom room3 room4 green_door_3
7. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room4
8. pick yellow_box_1 room4
9. gotodoor green_door_2 room4 room2
10. toggle green_door_2
11. gotoroom room4 room2 green_door_2
12. gotodoor green_door_1 room2 room1
13. toggle green_door_1
14. gotoroom room2 room1 green_door_1
15. gotoobject green_box_1 room1
16. pick green_box_1 room1

Now, check the constraints:

- "green_door_1 is not locked" in step13 (true).
- Before step13, step8 holds yellow_box_1 (satisfies the constraint).
- "green_door_1 is locked" in initial state (true).
- After initial state, in step13, green_door_1 is unlocked. But any state where green_door_1 is locked (only the initial state), and after that, we hold yellow_box_1 in step8. So the constraint is satisfied.
- "you are in room_2" in step11.
- "you are holding green_box_1" in step16.
- "in front of yellow_box_1" in step7.

All constraints are met. The goal is achieved in step13 when green_door_1 is unlocked and we are in front of it. However, the plan continues to pick green_box_1, which is necessary for the constraint.

But wait, after step13, we are in front of green_door_1 (room2 side), which is unlocked. So the goal is achieved at step13. The remaining steps (14-16) are to satisfy the green_box_1 constraint. But according to the problem statement, the plan must include all steps necessary to achieve the goal and satisfy constraints, even if some steps are after the goal is achieved.

Therefore, the shortest valid plan includes steps 1-16. However, I need to check if there's a way to pick green_box_1 earlier, reducing the total steps.

Alternative approach: After step11 (in room2), instead of immediately unlocking green_door_1, first go to room1 via another path to pick green_box_1. But room2's only door is green_door_1 (locked) and green_door_2 (unlocked). So to get to room1 from room2, green_door_1 is locked, but we can unlock it:

After step11 (in room2), unlock green_door_1, then go to room1 to pick green_box_1, then return.

But this would be the same as before.

In conclusion, the shortest valid plan is the one outlined above with 16 steps. But when writing the actual actions, some steps may be condensed. For example, after step13 (unlocking green_door_1), we are in front of it, so the goal is achieved. The remaining steps are to satisfy the green_box_1 constraint, which requires at least one state where it's held. So the plan can end after step16. However, the exact sequence must be written properly.

Now, let's write the correct action sequence:

```
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_3
toggle purple_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_3 purple_door_1
gotodoor green_door_3 room_3 room_4
toggle green_door_3
gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_3
gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_4
pick yellow_box_1 room_4
gotodoor green_door_2 room_4 room_2
toggle green_door_2
gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_2
gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_1
toggle green_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_1 green_door_1
gotoobject green_box_1 room_1
pick green_box_1 room_1
```

But this is 14 actions. However, the problem requires the goal to be achieved and all constraints satisfied. Let's check:

- The goal is achieved at step12 (toggle green_door_1), where we are in front of green_door_1 (room2 side), which is now unlocked.

But after step12, we then go to room1 (step13), pick green_box_1 (step15). So the steps are:

1. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_3
2. toggle purple_door_1
3. gotoroom room_1 room_3 purple_door_1
4. gotodoor green_door_3 room_3 room_4
5. toggle green_door_3
6. gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_3
7. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_4
8. pick yellow_box_1 room_4
9. gotodoor green_door_2 room_4 room_2
10. toggle green_door_2
11. gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_2
12. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_1
13. toggle green_door_1
14. gotoroom room_2 room_1 green_door_1
15. gotoobject green_box_1 room_1
16. pick green_box_1 room_1

This plan has 16 steps. However, after step13 (toggle green_door_1), we are in front of green_door_1 (room2), which is now unlocked. This satisfies the goal. The remaining steps (14-16) are to pick green_box_1, satisfying the constraint. But the problem requires the goal to be achieved, and all constraints to hold in the plan. So this plan is valid.

But is there a shorter plan? Let me count the steps again:

1. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_3
2. toggle purple_door_1
3. gotoroom room_1 room_3 purple_door_1
4. gotodoor green_door_3 room_3 room_4
5. toggle green_door_3
6. gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_3
7. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_4
8. pick yellow_box_1 room_4
9. gotodoor green_door_2 room_4 room_2
10. toggle green_door_2
11. gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_2
12. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_1
13. toggle green_door_1
14. gotoroom room_2 room_1 green_door_1
15. gotoobject green_box_1 room_1
16. pick green_box_1 room_1

Yes, 16 steps. But maybe steps can be optimized. For example, after step13, we are in front of green_door_1 (room2), which is unlocked. So the goal is met. Then steps14-16 are necessary for the green_box_1 constraint. However, perhaps the plan can end after step13, but the constraints require that we have to pick green_box_1. Therefore, the plan must include steps14-16.

But perhaps there's a way to pick green_box_1 earlier. For example, after step8 (holding yellow_box_1), go to room2 via green_door_2, unlock green_door_1, then pick green_box_1. But how?

After step11 (in room2), unlock green_door_1 (steps12-13). Then:

14. gotoroom room2 room1 green_door_1
15. gotoobject green_box_1 room1
16. pick green_box_1 room1

So this is 16 steps as before.

I think this is the minimal plan. So the final answer is as follows:
