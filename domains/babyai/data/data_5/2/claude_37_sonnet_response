Alright, let's break down the problem.

We have a 2D gridworld with 4 rooms arranged in a square formation. There are 4 doors connecting these rooms, and the rooms contain boxes and balls, each with a color.

Available actions:
- gotoobject x r: Go in front of object x in room r.
- gotoempty: Go in front of an empty position of the room.
- gotodoor d r1 r2: Go in front of door d, connecting room r1 to room r2.
- gotoroom r1 r2 d: Go to room r2 from room r1 using door d.
- pick x r: Pick up object x in room r.
- drop x r: Drop object x in room r.
- toggle d: Unlock door d if is locked. Lock door d if is unlocked.

Initial State:
- You are in room_1.
- Several objects are distributed across the rooms.
- All doors are locked.

Goal:
- "There is a door d such that "The following conditions are all true: "d is green", "you are in front of d", "d is not locked""

Constraints:
1. "green_door_1 is not locked" must hold in at least one state.
2. Before "green_door_1 is not locked" holds, "you are holding yellow_box_1" must be true.
3. "green_door_1 is locked" must hold in at least one state.
4. If "green_door_1 is locked" at a state s, then "you are holding yellow_box_1" must be true at s or after s.
5. "At least one of the following conditions is true: "you are in front of yellow_box_1", "purple_box_1 is in room_4"" must hold in at least one state.
6. "you are holding green_box_1" must hold in at least one state.
7. "you are in room_2" must hold in at least one state.

Let's think about how to satisfy these constraints while achieving the goal.

First, I need to consider which green door we want to end up in front of for the goal. There are three green doors: green_door_1, green_door_2, and green_door_3. Let's see which one is most accessible for our goal.

Given the constraints, we need to unlock green_door_1 at some point. Before that, we need to hold yellow_box_1, which is in room_4. However, to reach room_4, we need to go through either green_door_2 (from room_2) or green_door_3 (from room_3). Since all doors are initially locked, we'll need to unlock at least one of these doors first.

We also need to satisfy the constraint "you are holding green_box_1" at some point, and green_box_1 is initially in room_1. Additionally, we need to visit room_2 at some point.

Let's plan the steps:

1. We're in room_1. We have to pick up green_box_1 at some point (constraint 6), so let's do that first.
2. We need to unlock a door to get out of room_1. We have two options: green_door_1 (to room_2) or purple_door_1 (to room_3).
3. We need to pick up yellow_box_1 before unlocking green_door_1 (constraint 2), but yellow_box_1 is in room_4.
4. We have to visit room_2 (constraint 7), and also green_door_1 should be unlocked at some point (constraint 1).
5. For constraint 5, we need to either be in front of yellow_box_1 (which is in room_4) or move purple_box_1 (which is in room_3) to room_4.

Let's try to sketch a high-level plan:

1. Pick up green_box_1 in room_1.
2. Go to door purple_door_1 in room_1.
3. Unlock purple_door_1.
4. Go to room_3 from room_1 using purple_door_1.
5. Go to door green_door_3 in room_3.
6. Unlock green_door_3.
7. Go to room_4 from room_3 using green_door_3.
8. Pick up yellow_box_1 in room_4.
9. Go to door green_door_2 in room_4.
10. Unlock green_door_2.
11. Go to room_2 from room_4 using green_door_2.
12. Go to door green_door_1 in room_2.
13. Unlock green_door_1 (constraint 1 and constraint 2 are satisfied).
14. Drop yellow_box_1 in room_2.
15. Go to door green_door_1 in room_2.
16. Lock green_door_1 (constraint 3 is satisfied).
17. Pick up yellow_box_1 in room_2 (constraint 4 is satisfied).
18. Go to room_1 from room_2 using green_door_1.

Let's check if this satisfies all constraints:
- Constraint 1: "green_door_1 is not locked" holds at step 14.
- Constraint 2: Before step 14, "you are holding yellow_box_1" holds at step 13.
- Constraint 3: "green_door_1 is locked" holds from the beginning until step 13, and then holds again after step 16.
- Constraint 4: After step 16 (where "green_door_1 is locked"), "you are holding yellow_box_1" holds at step 17.
- Constraint 5: "you are in front of yellow_box_1" holds before step 8.
- Constraint 6: "you are holding green_box_1" holds after step 1.
- Constraint 7: "you are in room_2" holds after step 11.

Hmm, but I see a problem with this plan. When we go to room_3 from room_1, we'd no longer be holding green_box_1. So we'd need to pick it up, drop it, and then pick up yellow_box_1.

Let's refine the plan:

1. Go to object green_box_1 in room_1.
2. Pick up green_box_1 in room_1 (constraint 6 is satisfied).
3. Go to door purple_door_1 in room_1.
4. Toggle purple_door_1.
5. Go to room_3 from room_1 using purple_door_1.
6. Go to empty (to drop green_box_1).
7. Drop green_box_1 in room_3.
8. Go to door green_door_3 in room_3.
9. Toggle green_door_3.
10. Go to room_4 from room_3 using green_door_3.
11. Go to object yellow_box_1 in room_4 (constraint 5's first condition is satisfied).
12. Pick up yellow_box_1 in room_4.
13. Go to door green_door_2 in room_4.
14. Toggle green_door_2.
15. Go to room_2 from room_4 using green_door_2 (constraint 7 is satisfied).
16. Go to door green_door_1 in room_2.
17. Toggle green_door_1 (constraint 1 is satisfied, and constraint 2 is satisfied because we're holding yellow_box_1).
18. Drop yellow_box_1 in room_2.
19. Go to door green_door_1 in room_2.
20. Toggle green_door_1 (constraint 3 is satisfied).
21. Go to object yellow_box_1 in room_2.
22. Pick up yellow_box_1 in room_2 (constraint 4 is satisfied).
23. Go to door green_door_1 in room_2.

Now, let's check if this satisfies all constraints:
- Constraint 1: "green_door_1 is not locked" holds after step 17.
- Constraint 2: Before step 17, "you are holding yellow_box_1" holds at step 12.
- Constraint 3: "green_door_1 is locked" holds from the beginning until step 17, and then holds again after step 20.
- Constraint 4: After step 20 (where "green_door_1 is locked"), "you are holding yellow_box_1" holds at step 22.
- Constraint 5: "you are in front of yellow_box_1" holds at step 11.
- Constraint 6: "you are holding green_box_1" holds after step 2.
- Constraint 7: "you are in room_2" holds after step 15.

However, I see another issue. The goal is to be in front of an unlocked green door, but our current plan ends with green_door_1 locked. Let's modify the plan:

1. Go to object green_box_1 in room_1.
2. Pick up green_box_1 in room_1 (constraint 6 is satisfied).
3. Go to door purple_door_1 in room_1.
4. Toggle purple_door_1.
5. Go to room_3 from room_1 using purple_door_1.
6. Go to empty (to drop green_box_1).
7. Drop green_box_1 in room_3.
8. Go to door green_door_3 in room_3.
9. Toggle green_door_3.
10. Go to room_4 from room_3 using green_door_3.
11. Go to object yellow_box_1 in room_4 (constraint 5's first condition is satisfied).
12. Pick up yellow_box_1 in room_4.
13. Go to door green_door_2 in room_4.
14. Toggle green_door_2.
15. Go to room_2 from room_4 using green_door_2 (constraint 7 is satisfied).
16. Go to door green_door_1 in room_2.
17. Toggle green_door_1 (constraint 1 is satisfied, and constraint 2 is satisfied because we're holding yellow_box_1).
18. Drop yellow_box_1 in room_2.
19. Go to door green_door_1 in room_2.
20. Toggle green_door_1 (constraint 3 is satisfied).
21. Go to object yellow_box_1 in room_2.
22. Pick up yellow_box_1 in room_2 (constraint 4 is satisfied).
23. Go to door green_door_1 in room_2.
24. Toggle green_door_1.

With this addition, green_door_1 would be unlocked again at the end, and we'd be in front of it, satisfying the goal.

But there's one more issue. According to Constraint 4: If "green_door_1 is locked" at state s, then "you are holding yellow_box_1" must be true at s or after s.

We're toggling green_door_1 to lock it at step 20, but we're not holding yellow_box_1 at that point. We'll need to hold yellow_box_1 while locking green_door_1. Let's revise:

1. Go to object green_box_1 in room_1.
2. Pick up green_box_1 in room_1 (constraint 6 is satisfied).
3. Go to door purple_door_1 in room_1.
4. Toggle purple_door_1.
5. Go to room_3 from room_1 using purple_door_1.
6. Go to empty (to drop green_box_1).
7. Drop green_box_1 in room_3.
8. Go to door green_door_3 in room_3.
9. Toggle green_door_3.
10. Go to room_4 from room_3 using green_door_3.
11. Go to object yellow_box_1 in room_4 (constraint 5's first condition is satisfied).
12. Pick up yellow_box_1 in room_4.
13. Go to door green_door_2 in room_4.
14. Toggle green_door_2.
15. Go to room_2 from room_4 using green_door_2 (constraint 7 is satisfied).
16. Go to door green_door_1 in room_2.
17. Toggle green_door_1 (constraint 1 is satisfied, and constraint 2 is satisfied because we're holding yellow_box_1).
18. Go to empty.
19. Drop yellow_box_1 in room_2.
20. Go to object yellow_box_1 in room_2.
21. Pick up yellow_box_1 in room_2.
22. Go to door green_door_1 in room_2.
23. Toggle green_door_1 (constraint 3 is satisfied, and constraint 4 is satisfied because we're holding yellow_box_1).
24. Toggle green_door_1 (to unlock it again, satisfying the goal).

Hmm, there's a problem with the last two steps. We can't both satisfy constraint 4 and have the door be unlocked at the end with this approach. Let's rethink.

Since constraint 4 states that if "green_door_1 is locked" at state s, then "you are holding yellow_box_1" must be true at s or after s, and since green_door_1 is locked initially, we need to pick up yellow_box_1 at some point. Once we have it, we can unlock green_door_1, drop yellow_box_1, lock green_door_1 again, and then pick up yellow_box_1.

Let's refine the plan again:

1. Go to object green_box_1 in room_1.
2. Pick up green_box_1 in room_1 (constraint 6 is satisfied).
3. Go to door purple_door_1 in room_1.
4. Toggle purple_door_1.
5. Go to room_3 from room_1 using purple_door_1.
6. Go to empty (to drop green_box_1).
7. Drop green_box_1 in room_3.
8. Go to door green_door_3 in room_3.
9. Toggle green_door_3.
10. Go to room_4 from room_3 using green_door_3.
11. Go to object yellow_box_1 in room_4 (constraint 5's first condition is satisfied).
12. Pick up yellow_box_1 in room_4.
13. Go to door green_door_2 in room_4.
14. Toggle green_door_2.
15. Go to room_2 from room_4 using green_door_2 (constraint 7 is satisfied).
16. Go to door green_door_1 in room_2.
17. Toggle green_door_1 (constraint 1 is satisfied, and constraint 2 is satisfied because we're holding yellow_box_1).
18. Go to empty.
19. Drop yellow_box_1 in room_2.
20. Go to door green_door_1 in room_2.
21. Toggle green_door_1 (constraint 3 is satisfied).
22. Go to object yellow_box_1 in room_2.
23. Pick up yellow_box_1 in room_2 (constraint 4 is satisfied because we're now holding yellow_box_1 after green_door_1 is locked).
24. Go to door green_door_2 in room_2. (We're going to use green_door_2 for the goal since we can't both satisfy constraint 4 and have green_door_1 unlocked at the end).
25. Toggle green_door_2 (to ensure it's unlocked).

Now we're in front of green_door_2, which is green and unlocked, satisfying the goal. Let's check our constraints again:

- Constraint 1: "green_door_1 is not locked" holds after step 17.
- Constraint 2: Before step 17, "you are holding yellow_box_1" holds at step 12.
- Constraint 3: "green_door_1 is locked" holds from the beginning until step 17, and then holds again after step 21.
- Constraint 4: After step 21 (where "green_door_1 is locked"), "you are holding yellow_box_1" holds at step 23.
- Constraint 5: "you are in front of yellow_box_1" holds at step 11.
- Constraint 6: "you are holding green_box_1" holds after step 2.
- Constraint 7: "you are in room_2" holds after step 15.

Actually, there's an issue with the last step. If green_door_2 is already unlocked, toggling it would lock it, which doesn't satisfy the goal. Let's ensure we verify if green_door_2 is locked or unlocked before toggling.

However, I just realized that toggling green_door_2 in step 14 would unlock it, and it would remain unlocked. Toggling it in step 25 would lock it, which doesn't help with the goal. Let's adjust the plan:

1. Go to object green_box_1 in room_1.
2. Pick up green_box_1 in room_1 (constraint 6 is satisfied).
3. Go to door purple_door_1 in room_1.
4. Toggle purple_door_1.
5. Go to room_3 from room_1 using purple_door_1.
6. Go to empty (to drop green_box_1).
7. Drop green_box_1 in room_3.
8. Go to door green_door_3 in room_3.
9. Toggle green_door_3.
10. Go to room_4 from room_3 using green_door_3.
11. Go to object yellow_box_1 in room_4 (constraint 5's first condition is satisfied).
12. Pick up yellow_box_1 in room_4.
13. Go to door green_door_2 in room_4.
14. Toggle green_door_2.
15. Go to room_2 from room_4 using green_door_2 (constraint 7 is satisfied).
16. Go to door green_door_1 in room_2.
17. Toggle green_door_1 (constraint 1 is satisfied, and constraint 2 is satisfied because we're holding yellow_box_1).
18. Go to empty.
19. Drop yellow_box_1 in room_2.
20. Go to door green_door_1 in room_2.
21. Toggle green_door_1 (constraint 3 is satisfied).
22. Go to object yellow_box_1 in room_2.
23. Pick up yellow_box_1 in room_2 (constraint 4 is satisfied because we're now holding yellow_box_1 after green_door_1 is locked).
24. Go to door green_door_2 in room_2.

Now, we're in front of green_door_2, which is green and already unlocked (since we unlocked it in step 14), satisfying the goal.

Let's convert this to the exact action format:

1. gotoobject green_box_1 room_1
2. pick green_box_1 room_1
3. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_3
4. toggle purple_door_1
5. gotoroom room_1 room_3 purple_door_1
6. gotoempty
7. drop green_box_1 room_3
8. gotodoor green_door_3 room_3 room_4
9. toggle green_door_3
10. gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_3
11. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_4
12. pick yellow_box_1 room_4
13. gotodoor green_door_2 room_4 room_2
14. toggle green_door_2
15. gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_2
16. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_1
17. toggle green_door_1
18. gotoempty
19. drop yellow_box_1 room_2
20. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_1
21. toggle green_door_1
22. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_2
23. pick yellow_box_1 room_2
24. gotodoor green_door_2 room_2 room_4

Let me check once more:

Goal: "There is a door d such that "The following conditions are all true: "d is green", "you are in front of d", "d is not locked"""

After step 24, we're in front of green_door_2, which is green and not locked. This satisfies the goal.

Constraints:
1. "green_door_1 is not locked" must hold in at least one state.
After step 17, green_door_1 is not locked. Constraint 1 is satisfied.

2. Before "green_door_1 is not locked" holds, "you are holding yellow_box_1" must be true.
We're holding yellow_box_1 at step 17 when we unlock green_door_1. Constraint 2 is satisfied.

3. "green_door_1 is locked" must hold in at least one state.
green_door_1 is locked from the beginning until step 17, and it gets locked again at step 21. Constraint 3 is satisfied.

4. If "green_door_1 is locked" at a state s, then "you are holding yellow_box_1" must be true at s or after s.
After step 21 (where "green_door_1 is locked"), "you are holding yellow_box_1" holds at step 23. Constraint 4 is satisfied.

5. "At least one of the following conditions is true: "you are in front of yellow_box_1", "purple_box_1 is in room_4"" must hold in at least one state.
At step 11, we're in front of yellow_box_1. Constraint 5 is satisfied.

6. "you are holding green_box_1" must hold in at least one state.
After step 2, we're holding green_box_1. Constraint 6 is satisfied.

7. "you are in room_2" must hold in at least one state.
After step 15, we're in room_2. Constraint 7 is satisfied.

Alright, it seems like our plan satisfies all the constraints and achieves the goal. Let's finalize it:

1. gotoobject green_box_1 room_1
2. pick green_box_1 room_1
3. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_3
4. toggle purple_door_1
5. gotoroom room_1 room_3 purple_door_1
6. gotoempty
7. drop green_box_1 room_3
8. gotodoor green_door_3 room_3 room_4
9. toggle green_door_3
10. gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_3
11. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_4
12. pick yellow_box_1 room_4
13. gotodoor green_door_2 room_4 room_2
14. toggle green_door_2
15. gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_2
16. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_1
17. toggle green_door_1
18. gotoempty
19. drop yellow_box_1 room_2
20. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_1
21. toggle green_door_1
22. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_2
23. pick yellow_box_1 room_2
24. gotodoor green_door_2 room_2 room_4

I can't think of more optimizations, and this plan seems optimal. It satisfies all constraints and achieves our goal. There are 24 steps in total.

Actually, let me double-check a few things. I want to make sure that when we do "gotodoor green_door_2 room_2 room_4", we're going in front of the green_door_2 that is in room_2 and leads to room_4. I also need to make sure we're following the proper format for the goto actions.

Let's adapt the action sequence slightly to ensure clarity:

1. gotoobject green_box_1 room_1
2. pick green_box_1 room_1
3. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_3
4. toggle purple_door_1
5. gotoroom room_1 room_3 purple_door_1
6. gotoempty
7. drop green_box_1 room_3
8. gotodoor green_door_3 room_3 room_4
9. toggle green_door_3
10. gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_3
11. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_4
12. pick yellow_box_1 room_4
13. gotodoor green_door_2 room_4 room_2
14. toggle green_door_2
15. gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_2
16. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_1
17. toggle green_door_1
18. gotoempty
19. drop yellow_box_1 room_2
20. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_1
21. toggle green_door_1
22. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_2
23. pick yellow_box_1 room_2
24. gotodoor green_door_2 room_2 room_4

This seems correct. We'll be at green_door_2 in room_2 facing towards room_4, and the door is unlocked (as we toggled it from locked to unlocked in step 14). This achieves our goal of being in front of an unlocked green door.

Just to be extra sure, let me run through the plan one more time:

We start in room_1. First, we pick up green_box_1 (satisfying constraint 6). We unlock purple_door_1 and go to room_3. We drop green_box_1 in room_3. Then, we unlock green_door_3 and go to room_4. Here, we pick up yellow_box_1 (satisfying constraint 5). We then unlock green_door_2 and go to room_2 (satisfying constraint 7). Next, we unlock green_door_1 (satisfying constraint 1 and 2 since we are holding yellow_box_1). We drop yellow_box_1 in room_2, re-lock green_door_1 (satisfying constraint 3), and pick up yellow_box_1 again (satisfying constraint 4). Finally, we navigate to green_door_2, which is green and unlocked, achieving our goal.

This plan seems optimal and satisfies all the constraints.
