Let me analyze the problem:

I'm an agent in a 2D gridworld with 4 rooms arranged in a square. I have to navigate through doors, pick up and drop objects (boxes and balls), and toggle doors (lock/unlock). My goal is to hold a yellow ball.

Let's first understand the layout of the rooms and doors:
- room_1 (northwest) connects to room_2 (southwest) via yellow_door_1
- room_1 (northwest) connects to room_3 (northeast) via purple_door_1
- room_2 (southwest) connects to room_4 (southeast) via green_door_1
- room_3 (northeast) connects to room_4 (southeast) via green_door_2

Initially:
- I am in room_2
- All doors are locked
- The objects are distributed in the rooms (various balls and boxes)
- My hands are empty
- I have only visited room_2

My goal is to hold any yellow ball. Looking at the locations:
- yellow_ball_1 is in room_2 (where I start)
- yellow_ball_2 is in room_3
- yellow_ball_3 and yellow_ball_4 are in room_4

Now, let's examine the constraints:
1. At some point, I must be holding an object.
2. If I'm holding an object, at some point after that I must either be in room_4 or yellow_door_1 must be unlocked.
3. At some point, I must be in room_4.
4. At some point, either empty is in room_1 or I'm holding purple_ball_1.
5. At some point, yellow_door_1 must be unlocked.
6. At some point, I must not be holding any object (this is already true initially).
7. If I'm not holding any object, at some point after that I must either be in room_4 or purple_ball_1 must be in room_4.

I start in room_2 with yellow_ball_1 and need to pick it up. But there's a constraint that if I'm holding an object, I must either go to room_4 or unlock yellow_door_1 at some point after that.

All doors are initially locked, so I need to go to each door and toggle them to unlock. Since I start in room_2, I can access:
- yellow_door_1 (connects to room_1)
- green_door_1 (connects to room_4)

Let's think about a plan:

1. In room_2, I can pick up yellow_ball_1.
2. I need to either go to room_4 or unlock yellow_door_1.
3. I can go to yellow_door_1 and toggle it (unlocking it).
4. I can then go to green_door_1 and toggle it (unlocking it).
5. Then I can go to room_4.

This would satisfy constraints #1, #2, #3, and #5.

For constraint #4, I either need to be holding purple_ball_1 or have "empty" in room_1. Since empty is not a physical object but a placeholder, I think this means I need to hold purple_ball_1 at some point.

For constraint #7, since I start not holding any object, I need to either go to room_4 or move purple_ball_1 to room_4. Since I need to go to room_4 anyway for constraint #3, this should be satisfied.

So, I need to:
1. Pick up yellow_ball_1 in room_2.
2. Unlock yellow_door_1.
3. Unlock green_door_1.
4. Go to room_4.
5. Drop yellow_ball_1.
6. Go to room_3 (unlock green_door_2 if needed).
7. Pick up purple_ball_1 in room_3.
8. Return to room_4.
9. Drop purple_ball_1.
10. Pick up a yellow ball (either yellow_ball_3 or yellow_ball_4) in room_4.

Let's start building the plan step by step:

```
gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2  # Go to yellow_ball_1
pick yellow_ball_1 room_2        # Pick up yellow_ball_1
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_1  # Go to yellow_door_1
toggle yellow_door_1             # Unlock yellow_door_1
gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4  # Go to green_door_1
toggle green_door_1              # Unlock green_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1  # Go to room_4
gotoempty                        # Go to an empty position
drop yellow_ball_1 room_4        # Drop yellow_ball_1
gotodoor green_door_2 room_4 room_3  # Go to green_door_2
toggle green_door_2              # Unlock green_door_2
gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_2  # Go to room_3
gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_3  # Go to purple_ball_1
pick purple_ball_1 room_3        # Pick up purple_ball_1
gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_2  # Return to room_4
gotoempty                        # Go to an empty position
drop purple_ball_1 room_4        # Drop purple_ball_1
gotoobject yellow_ball_3 room_4  # Go to yellow_ball_3
pick yellow_ball_3 room_4        # Pick up yellow_ball_3
```

Wait, I think I'm making this too complicated. Let me recheck the constraints and goal:

Goal: Hold a yellow ball.
- yellow_ball_1 is in room_2 (where I start)

Constraints:
1. At some point, I must be holding an object. (Satisfied by picking up yellow_ball_1)
2. If I'm holding an object, at some point after that I must either be in room_4 or yellow_door_1 must be unlocked. (Will be satisfied by unlocking yellow_door_1)
3. At some point, I must be in room_4. (Will go there)
4. At some point, either empty is in room_1 or I'm holding purple_ball_1. (Will pick up purple_ball_1)
5. At some point, yellow_door_1 must be unlocked. (Will unlock it)
6. At some point, I must not be holding any object. (Already satisfied initially)
7. If I'm not holding any object, at some point after that I must either be in room_4 or purple_ball_1 must be in room_4. (Will go to room_4)

Alright, now I realize that I've been thinking too complicatedly about this. Let's simplify and focus on the goal of holding a yellow ball.

Let's see, the yellow balls are in the following locations:
- yellow_ball_1 is in room_2 (where I start)
- yellow_ball_2 is in room_3
- yellow_ball_3 and yellow_ball_4 are in room_4

The easiest yellow ball to pick up is yellow_ball_1 in room_2, which is the room I'm starting in.

So, a simpler plan would be:

```
gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2  # Go to yellow_ball_1
pick yellow_ball_1 room_2        # Pick up yellow_ball_1
```

This would accomplish the goal. But let's check if it satisfies all constraints:

1. At some point, I must be holding an object. (Satisfied by picking up yellow_ball_1)
2. If I'm holding an object, at some point after that I must either be in room_4 or yellow_door_1 must be unlocked. (Not yet satisfied)
3. At some point, I must be in room_4. (Not yet satisfied)
4. At some point, either empty is in room_1 or I'm holding purple_ball_1. (Not yet satisfied)
5. At some point, yellow_door_1 must be unlocked. (Not yet satisfied)
6. At some point, I must not be holding any object. (Satisfied initially)
7. If I'm not holding any object, at some point after that I must either be in room_4 or purple_ball_1 must be in room_4. (Will be satisfied by going to room_4)

So, I still need to:
- Unlock yellow_door_1 (constraint #5)
- Go to room_4 (constraint #3, and part of constraint #2 and #7)
- Pick up purple_ball_1 (constraint #4)

Let's add these to the plan:

```
gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2  # Go to yellow_ball_1
pick yellow_ball_1 room_2        # Pick up yellow_ball_1
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_1  # Go to yellow_door_1
toggle yellow_door_1             # Unlock yellow_door_1 (satisfies constraint #5)
gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4  # Go to green_door_1
toggle green_door_1              # Unlock green_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1  # Go to room_4 (satisfies constraint #3 and part of #2 and #7)
```

Now, for constraint #4, I need to either have "empty is in room_1" (which I'm not sure how to interpret) or be holding purple_ball_1. Since purple_ball_1 is in room_3, I need to:

```
gotodoor green_door_2 room_4 room_3  # Go to green_door_2
toggle green_door_2              # Unlock green_door_2
gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_2  # Go to room_3
```

But wait, if I'm holding yellow_ball_1, I can't pick up purple_ball_1. I would need to drop yellow_ball_1 first. But my goal is to hold a yellow ball. This could be a problem.

Let me think this through more carefully:

1. I pick up yellow_ball_1 in room_2.
2. I unlock yellow_door_1 (satisfying constraint #5).
3. I unlock green_door_1.
4. I go to room_4 (satisfying constraint #3 and part of #2 and #7).
5. I drop yellow_ball_1 (temporary, will pick up later).
6. I unlock green_door_2.
7. I go to room_3.
8. I pick up purple_ball_1 (satisfying constraint #4).
9. I go back to room_4.
10. I drop purple_ball_1.
11. I pick up a yellow ball (either yellow_ball_1, yellow_ball_3, or yellow_ball_4).

This plan should satisfy all constraints and achieve the goal. Let's fine-tune it:

```
gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2  # Go to yellow_ball_1
pick yellow_ball_1 room_2        # Pick up yellow_ball_1 (satisfies constraint #1)
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_1  # Go to yellow_door_1
toggle yellow_door_1             # Unlock yellow_door_1 (satisfies constraint #5)
gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4  # Go to green_door_1
toggle green_door_1              # Unlock green_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1  # Go to room_4 (satisfies constraint #3 and part of #2 and #7)
gotoempty                        # Go to an empty position
drop yellow_ball_1 room_4        # Drop yellow_ball_1
gotodoor green_door_2 room_4 room_3  # Go to green_door_2
toggle green_door_2              # Unlock green_door_2
gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_2  # Go to room_3
gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_3  # Go to purple_ball_1
pick purple_ball_1 room_3        # Pick up purple_ball_1 (satisfies constraint #4)
gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_2  # Return to room_4
gotoempty                        # Go to an empty position
drop purple_ball_1 room_4        # Drop purple_ball_1
gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_4  # Go to yellow_ball_1
pick yellow_ball_1 room_4        # Pick up yellow_ball_1 (achieves the goal)
```

Actually, I'm not sure if I need to drop purple_ball_1. The goal states "There is a ball v such that 'The following conditions are all true: v is yellow, you are holding v'". So, I need to hold a yellow ball. I'm already holding purple_ball_1 at step 13.

Let's revise:

```
gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2  # Go to yellow_ball_1
pick yellow_ball_1 room_2        # Pick up yellow_ball_1 (satisfies constraint #1)
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_1  # Go to yellow_door_1
toggle yellow_door_1             # Unlock yellow_door_1 (satisfies constraint #5)
gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4  # Go to green_door_1
toggle green_door_1              # Unlock green_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1  # Go to room_4 (satisfies constraint #3 and part of #2 and #7)
```

Actually, I think I'm overthinking. Let me re-read the problem to ensure I understand the constraints correctly.

Ok, let me reconsider the constraints:

1. At some point, I must be holding an object.
2. If I'm holding an object, at some point after that I must either be in room_4 or yellow_door_1 must be unlocked.
3. At some point, I must be in room_4.
4. At some point, either "empty is in room_1" or I'm holding purple_ball_1.
5. At some point, yellow_door_1 must be unlocked.
6. At some point, I must not be holding any object.
7. If I'm not holding any object, at some point after that I must either be in room_4 or purple_ball_1 must be in room_4.

Constraint #4 says "either empty is in room_1 or I'm holding purple_ball_1." I'm not sure what "empty is in room_1" means. I think it might refer to the "empty_0 empty" object mentioned in the list of objects.

But let's assume it's asking for me to hold purple_ball_1 at some point.

Let's simplify and think of a plan that satisfies all constraints:

1. Start in room_2 with empty hands (satisfies constraint #6).
2. Go to yellow_ball_1 in room_2.
3. Pick up yellow_ball_1 (satisfies constraint #1).
4. Go to yellow_door_1.
5. Toggle yellow_door_1 to unlock it (satisfies constraint #5).
6. Go to green_door_1.
7. Toggle green_door_1 to unlock it.
8. Go to room_4 using green_door_1 (satisfies constraint #3 and part of #2 and #7).
9. Drop yellow_ball_1 to free hands.
10. Go to green_door_2.
11. Toggle green_door_2 to unlock it.
12. Go to room_3 using green_door_2.
13. Go to purple_ball_1 in room_3.
14. Pick up purple_ball_1 (satisfies constraint #4).
15. Go back to room_4 using green_door_2.
16. Drop purple_ball_1 in room_4 (satisfies the rest of constraint #7).
17. Go to a yellow ball in room_4 (either yellow_ball_3 or yellow_ball_4).
18. Pick up the yellow ball (achieves the goal).

Let's check if this plan satisfies all constraints:

1. At some point, I must be holding an object. (Satisfied by picking up yellow_ball_1)
2. If I'm holding an object, at some point after that I must either be in room_4 or yellow_door_1 must be unlocked. (Satisfied by unlocking yellow_door_1 after picking up yellow_ball_1, and also by going to room_4 after picking up purple_ball_1)
3. At some point, I must be in room_4. (Satisfied by going to room_4)
4. At some point, either "empty is in room_1" or I'm holding purple_ball_1. (Satisfied by picking up purple_ball_1)
5. At some point, yellow_door_1 must be unlocked. (Satisfied by unlocking yellow_door_1)
6. At some point, I must not be holding any object. (Satisfied initially)
7. If I'm not holding any object, at some point after that I must either be in room_4 or purple_ball_1 must be in room_4. (Satisfied by going to room_4 and by dropping purple_ball_1 in room_4)

This plan seems to satisfy all constraints and achieve the goal. Let's formalize it to ensure correct action formats:

```
gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2
pick yellow_ball_1 room_2
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_1
toggle yellow_door_1
gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4
toggle green_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1
gotoempty
drop yellow_ball_1 room_4
gotodoor green_door_2 room_4 room_3
toggle green_door_2
gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_2
gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_3
pick purple_ball_1 room_3
gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_2
gotoempty
drop purple_ball_1 room_4
gotoobject yellow_ball_3 room_4
pick yellow_ball_3 room_4
```

I think this is a valid plan. Let's make sure it's also optimal. We start in room_2, and ultimately, we need to be holding a yellow ball.

The shortest path to holding a yellow ball would be to pick up yellow_ball_1 from room_2 (where we start). This is just two actions:

```
gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2
pick yellow_ball_1 room_2
```

But we need to satisfy all constraints. Let's revisit them to see if there's a shorter solution:

1. At some point, I must be holding an object. (Satisfied by picking up yellow_ball_1)
2. If I'm holding an object, at some point after that I must either be in room_4 or yellow_door_1 must be unlocked. (Satisfied by unlocking yellow_door_1 after picking up yellow_ball_1)
3. At some point, I must be in room_4. (Satisfied by going to room_4)
4. At some point, either "empty is in room_1" or I'm holding purple_ball_1. (Satisfied by picking up purple_ball_1)
5. At some point, yellow_door_1 must be unlocked. (Satisfied by unlocking yellow_door_1)
6. At some point, I must not be holding any object. (Satisfied initially)
7. If I'm not holding any object, at some point after that I must either be in room_4 or purple_ball_1 must be in room_4. (Satisfied by going to room_4)

I think the plan is already pretty minimal. We need to:
- Pick up yellow_ball_1 (satisfies constraint #1 and helps achieve the goal)
- Unlock yellow_door_1 (satisfies constraint #5 and part of #2)
- Go to room_4 (satisfies constraint #3 and part of #7)
- Go to room_3 to get and pick up purple_ball_1 (satisfies constraint #4)
- Go back to room_4 to drop purple_ball_1 (satisfies part of #7)
- Pick up a yellow ball in room_4 (achieves the goal)

So, I think the plan I provided is optimal in terms of action count.

Wait, let me reconsider constraint #4. It says "At some point, either 'empty is in room_1' or I'm holding purple_ball_1." I'm still unclear about "empty is in room_1". If it means I need to have freed up space in room_1 by removing an object, I could do that by going to room_1 and picking up blue_box_1.

Let me reconsider the entire plan to see if there's a more optimal solution.

Starting again:
1. I'm in room_2 with empty hands.
2. I want to end up holding a yellow ball.
3. I need to satisfy all constraints.

If I can understand what "empty is in room_1" means for constraint #4, I might be able to create a more optimal plan. If it means I need to have 'empty_0 empty' in room_1, or I need to free up space in room_1, or I need to put an "empty" placeholder in room_1, I'm not sure how to achieve that based on the provided actions.

But if I can satisfy constraint #4 by holding purple_ball_1 at some point, then the plan I've outlined is as follows:

1. Pick up yellow_ball_1 in room_2.
2. Unlock yellow_door_1.
3. Unlock green_door_1.
4. Go to room_4.
5. Drop yellow_ball_1.
6. Unlock green_door_2.
7. Go to room_3.
8. Pick up purple_ball_1.
9. Go back to room_4.
10. Drop purple_ball_1.
11. Pick up a yellow ball in room_4.

This plan should achieve the goal and satisfy all constraints. But I'm not entirely sure about the interpretation of constraint #4. If "empty is in room_1" can be achieved by a simpler action, the plan might be more optimal.

Actually, let me just assume that the constraint #4 is referring to me holding purple_ball_1 at some point. I'm confident that my plan satisfies that.

Let's review the plan one more time:

```
gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2
pick yellow_ball_1 room_2
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_1
toggle yellow_door_1
gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4
toggle green_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1
gotoempty
drop yellow_ball_1 room_4
gotodoor green_door_2 room_4 room_3
toggle green_door_2
gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_2
gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_3
pick purple_ball_1 room_3
gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_2
gotoempty
drop purple_ball_1 room_4
gotoobject yellow_ball_3 room_4
pick yellow_ball_3 room_4
```

I think this plan seems optimal for satisfying all constraints. It uses the following logic:
- We pick up yellow_ball_1 in room_2 (satisfying constraint #1).
- We unlock yellow_door_1 (satisfying constraint #5).
- We go to room_4 (satisfying constraint #3 and part of constraint #7).
- We pick up purple_ball_1 (satisfying constraint #4).
- We drop objects when needed to pick up other objects.
- We end up holding a yellow ball (achieving the goal).

I think it's a valid and optimal plan.

Let me double check the format of my answer according to the prompt:

The format of each action in the plan should be: 'ActionName Argument1 ... ArgumentN', where each argument is an element of the domain. Write each action of a plan in a separate line. Delineate the plan with one top line and one bottom line containing only 3 '`' characters.

So, my final answre:

```
gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2
pick yellow_ball_1 room_2
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_1
toggle yellow_door_1
gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4
toggle green_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1
gotoempty
drop yellow_ball_1 room_4
gotodoor green_door_2 room_4 room_3
toggle green_door_2
gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_2
gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_3
pick purple_ball_1 room_3
gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_2
gotoempty
drop purple_ball_1 room_4
gotoobject yellow_ball_3 room_4
pick yellow_ball_3 room_4
```

Let me put it within the triple backticks.

```
gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2
pick yellow_ball_1 room_2
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_1
toggle yellow_door_1
gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4
toggle green_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1
gotoempty
drop yellow_ball_1 room_4
gotodoor green_door_2 room_4 room_3
toggle green_door_2
gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_2
gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_3
pick purple_ball_1 room_3
gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_2
gotoempty
drop purple_ball_1 room_4
gotoobject yellow_ball_3 room_4
pick yellow_ball_3 room_4
```

Oh actually, the triple backticks should only contain ``` to delineate the plan. So my final answer is:

```
gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2
pick yellow_ball_1 room_2
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_1
toggle yellow_door_1
gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4
toggle green_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1
gotoempty
drop yellow_ball_1 room_4
gotodoor green_door_2 room_4 room_3
toggle green_door_2
gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_2
gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_3
pick purple_ball_1 room_3
gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_2
gotoempty
drop purple_ball_1 room_4
gotoobject yellow_ball_3 room_4
pick yellow_ball_3 room_4
```
