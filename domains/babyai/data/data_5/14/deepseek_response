```
gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2
pick yellow_ball_1 room_2
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_1
toggle yellow_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_1 yellow_door_1

gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1

```

Wait, the previous thought process concluded with a plan of 10 steps, but the final answer here has 12 steps. This discrepancy suggests a mistake. Let me re-examine.

In the thought process, the optimal plan was determined to be:

1. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_1
2. toggle yellow_door_1
3. gotoroom room_2 room_1 yellow_door_1
4. gotoempty
5. gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1
6. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4
7. toggle green_door_1
8. gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1
9. gotoobject yellow_ball_3 room_4
10. pick yellow_ball_3 room_4

But the assistant's answer includes additional steps like dropping and picking up again. That's incorrect. The correct plan should follow the optimal path identified. However, the assistant's answer has extra steps, likely due to an error in transcription or misunderstanding. The correct optimal plan should be the 10-step plan from the thought process, but the assistant provided a longer one. Let me correct this.

The correct steps based on the optimal plan from the thought process are:

```
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_1
toggle yellow_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_1 yellow_door_1
gotoempty
gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1
gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4
toggle green_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1
gotoobject yellow_ball_3 room_4
pick yellow_ball_3 room_4
```

But wait, the initial thought process considered the need to drop and pick up again to satisfy constraint 6 (not holding any object at some state). However, in the 10-step plan, the agent holds the yellow_ball_3 at step 10. The step 6 (constraint 6) requires that the agent is not holding any object at least once. In the plan above, before step 10, the agent was not holding anything. For example, steps 1-9: agent is not holding anything except step 10. So step 6 is satisfied because before step 10, the agent was not holding anything. However, the final plan must end with holding a yellow ball. So the plan is valid.

But the assistant's answer included dropping and picking up again, which is unnecessary. Therefore, the correct optimal plan is the 10-step plan. However, in the assistant's answer, it included steps to pick yellow_ball_1, then drop it, then pick yellow_ball_3, which adds unnecessary steps.

The correct optimal plan is as follows, with steps ensuring all constraints are met:

```
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_1
toggle yellow_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_1 yellow_door_1
gotoempty
gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1
gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4
toggle green_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1
gotoobject yellow_ball_3 room_4
pick yellow_ball_3 room_4
```

Each step is necessary and valid. This plan is shorter and meets all constraints.
