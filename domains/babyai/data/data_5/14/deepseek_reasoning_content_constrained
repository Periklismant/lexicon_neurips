Okay, let me try to figure out how to solve this planning problem. The goal is to have a yellow ball in my hands. The constraints are a bit complex, so I need to make sure each one is satisfied. Let's start by breaking down the problem.

First, the initial state: I'm in room_2. The yellow_ball_1 is also in room_2. All doors are locked. The other yellow balls are in room_3 and room_4, but getting to them might require unlocking doors. The final goal is to hold a yellow ball. Let's see the constraints:

1. At least once, I must be holding some object. That's part of the goal, so that's covered.
2. Whenever I'm holding an object, either I'm in room_4 or yellow_door_1 is unlocked. So if I pick up the yellow_ball_1 in room_2, I need to unlock yellow_door_1 at some point after or during holding it.
3. I must be in room_4 at least once.
4. At some point, either empty is in room_1 (which doesn't make sense, maybe it's a typo?) or I'm holding purple_ball_1. Since purple_ball_1 is in room_3, I might need to go there and pick it up, but that's not part of the goal. Alternatively, maybe "empty is in room_1" refers to an empty position? Not sure, but maybe if I go to an empty spot in room_1, that counts. Hmm. Or maybe it's a mistranslation, like there's an empty object? The problem says "empty_0 empty" is an object. Wait, maybe "empty_0 is in room_1". But the initial state doesn't mention that. This is confusing. Maybe the condition is that either empty_0 is in room_1 or I hold purple_ball_1. So maybe I need to go to room_1 and do something with empty_0 or pick up purple_ball_1. But purple_ball_1 is in room_3. So perhaps I need to go to room_3, pick up purple_ball_1, which would satisfy that condition. But that's not part of the main goal. So maybe I need to include that in the plan.
5. The yellow_door_1 must be unlocked at some point.
6. I must not be holding anything at some state.
7. Whenever I'm not holding anything, either I'm in room_4 or purple_ball_1 is in room_4. So after dropping something, I need to ensure that either I'm in room_4 or move purple_ball_1 there.

The main goal is to hold a yellow ball. The closest yellow ball is yellow_ball_1 in room_2. But if I pick it up, then according to constraint 2, I need to unlock yellow_door_1 (since I might not be in room_4 yet). Also, I need to be in room_4 at some point, so maybe after picking up the ball, I can go to room_4 via room_2's green_door_1, but that door is locked. Alternatively, unlock yellow_door_1, go to room_1, then maybe room_3 via purple_door_1 (which is locked), but that's another problem.

Wait, the doors: room_1 is connected to room_2 via yellow_door_1, room_1 to room_3 via purple_door_1, room_2 to room_4 via green_door_1, and room_3 to room_4 via green_door_2. All doors are initially locked.

So starting in room_2. Let's think about the steps.

Option 1: Pick up yellow_ball_1 in room_2. But before that, need to go to the object. Since I'm already in room_2, I can gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2, then pick it up. But then, according to constraint 2, while holding it, I need to either be in room_4 or have yellow_door_1 unlocked. Since I just picked it up, I need to unlock yellow_door_1. But to toggle a door, I need to be in front of it. The yellow_door_1 connects room_1 and room_2. So I'm in room_2. So I can gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_1 (assuming the syntax is gotodoor d r1 r2 where r1 is current room). Then toggle it. But can I go to the door if there's no object blocking? The initial state doesn't mention any objects blocking doors. So maybe that's possible.

So plan steps:

1. gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2
2. pick yellow_ball_1 room_2
3. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_1
4. toggle yellow_door_1 (this unlocks it)
5. Now, need to satisfy being in room_4. So maybe go to room_4 via green_door_1 from room_2. But green_door_1 is locked. So need to unlock that. But to unlock green_door_1, need to be in front of it. So from room_2, gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4, then toggle. Then gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1. But while holding the ball, after step 5, I'm in room_4. That would satisfy constraint 3. Then drop the ball in room_4. But the goal is to hold it. Wait, the goal is to have a yellow ball held. So maybe the final action is to pick it, but the plan must end with holding it. So perhaps after step 4, I can go to room_4.

Wait, but the constraints require that if I'm holding an object (which I am after step 2), then in that state or after, either I'm in room_4 or yellow_door_1 is unlocked. Since I toggled yellow_door_1 in step 4, which unlocks it, that satisfies the condition. Then, I can proceed to room_4. But how?

From room_2, after unlocking yellow_door_1, but I need to go to room_4. The green_door_1 is still locked. So I have to unlock that too. So steps after step 4:

5. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4
6. toggle green_door_1 (unlocks it)
7. gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1 (now in room_4)
8. Now, in room_4. Then I can drop the ball here (but I need to hold it at the end). Wait, the goal is to be holding a yellow ball. So the plan must end with me holding a yellow ball. So perhaps I can't drop it. But then, how to satisfy the constraint that I must not be holding any object at some state. So I need to pick up the ball, then drop it, then pick it up again? But that complicates things. Alternatively, after holding the ball, I can go to room_4, then maybe drop it there and pick it up again. Let's see.

Wait, constraints:

- The final goal is to hold a yellow ball.

- Constraint 6: Must not be holding any object in at least one state.

- Constraint 7: Whenever I'm not holding, I must be in room_4 or purple_ball_1 is in room_4. So after dropping, I need to be in room_4 or move purple_ball_1 there. Since purple_ball_1 is in room_3, moving it to room_4 would require going through green_door_2, which is locked. That's complicated.

Alternatively, after dropping the yellow_ball_1 in room_4, I can be in room_4, satisfying constraint 7.

But this seems messy. Maybe a better approach is to first unlock the necessary doors, go to room_4, then get a yellow ball there. But the yellow_ball_3 and 4 are in room_4. So maybe:

Unlock doors to get to room_4. Let's see. Starting in room_2.

To go to room_4 from room_2, need to unlock green_door_1. But to do that:

1. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4
2. toggle green_door_1 (unlocks it)
3. gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1 (now in room_4)
But then I need to be in room_4, which satisfies constraint 3. Then, pick up yellow_ball_3 or 4. But then I need to hold a yellow ball. So:

4. gotoobject yellow_ball_3 room_4
5. pick yellow_ball_3 room_4

But then, constraint 2: when holding the ball, either I'm in room_4 (which I am) or yellow_door_1 is unlocked. Since I'm in room_4, that's okay. So this would satisfy the main goal and constraints. But wait, what about the other constraints?

Constraint 4: At least once, either empty is in room_1 or holding purple_ball_1. If I never go to room_1 or room_3, then how to satisfy this? The initial state of room_1 has blue_box_1. The empty_0 is an object, but it's not clear where it is. The problem lists "empty_0 empty" as an object but initial state doesn't mention its location. Maybe the "empty" in the constraint refers to an empty position, not the object. But the way the constraint is written: "empty is in room_1" â€” maybe it's a typo and refers to the empty_0 object. If empty_0 is not in room_1 initially, then we need to move it there? But how? The empty_0 is an empty position? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe "empty is in room_1" is a way to say that there's an empty spot in room_1. But the gotoempty action allows going to an empty position. So maybe if I go to an empty position in room_1, that counts as "empty is in room_1". But how to model that in the state. The problem might have a condition that after performing gotoempty in room_1, the empty position is considered as "empty is in room_1". But the way the constraints are written is a bit ambiguous.

Alternatively, perhaps the constraint is that either the agent is holding purple_ball_1 or there's an empty spot in room_1. To satisfy this, maybe the agent can go to room_1 and perform gotoempty, which would make "empty is in room_1" true. So:

So let's adjust the plan to include going to room_1 and doing a gotoempty there. Let's try:

1. From room_2, unlock yellow_door_1:
   - gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_1
   - toggle yellow_door_1 (unlocks it)
2. Then go to room_1 via gotoroom room_2 room_1 yellow_door_1.
3. In room_1, perform gotoempty. That would make "empty is in room_1" true (assuming that counts as the condition).
4. Then return to room_2 via yellow_door_1.
5. Then unlock green_door_1 and go to room_4.
6. Pick up a yellow ball there.

But this adds steps. Let's see if this satisfies all constraints.

Another approach: Maybe pick up purple_ball_1 in room_3. But that's in room_3, which is connected to room_1 via purple_door_1, which is locked. So to get to room_3, need to unlock purple_door_1. That requires being in room_1, which requires unlocking yellow_door_1 first. Then go to room_1, unlock purple_door_1, go to room_3, pick up purple_ball_1, which would satisfy constraint 4 (holding purple_ball_1). Then drop it in room_4 to satisfy constraint 7 when not holding anything.

But this seems complicated. Let's outline the steps for this approach:

1. Unlock yellow_door_1 (from room_2):
   a. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_1
   b. toggle yellow_door_1 (unlock)
2. Go to room_1:
   c. gotoroom room_2 room_1 yellow_door_1
3. Unlock purple_door_1 (from room_1):
   d. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_3
   e. toggle purple_door_1 (unlock)
4. Go to room_3:
   f. gotoroom room_1 room_3 purple_door_1
5. Pick up purple_ball_1:
   g. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_3
   h. pick purple_ball_1 room_3 (this satisfies constraint 4)
6. Now, holding purple_ball_1, need to get to room_4. From room_3, need to unlock green_door_2:
   i. gotodoor green_door_2 room_3 room_4
   j. toggle green_door_2 (unlock)
7. Go to room_4:
   k. gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_2
8. Drop purple_ball_1 in room_4 (to satisfy constraint 7 when not holding anything later):
   l. drop purple_ball_1 room_4
9. Now, go to yellow_ball_3 or 4 in room_4:
   m. gotoobject yellow_ball_3 room_4
   n. pick yellow_ball_3 room_4 (achieve goal)
10. Also, need to unlock green_door_1 from room_2 to room_4? Because in this path, we went through room_3 to room_4. But maybe not necessary. However, constraint 3 requires being in room_4, which is satisfied here. Also, during the time when holding purple_ball_1, constraint 2 requires that either in room_4 or yellow_door_1 is unlocked. When we picked up purple_ball_1 in room_3, we were not in room_4, but yellow_door_1 was unlocked (from step 1), so that's okay. Then when we drop it in room_4, we are in room_4. Then, when we pick up the yellow ball in room_4, we are in room_4, satisfying constraint 2.

Additionally, constraint 5 requires that yellow_door_1 is unlocked at some point, which step 1 achieves.

Constraint 6 requires that the agent is not holding any object at some state. Step l (dropping purple_ball_1) satisfies that. Then, constraint 7: when not holding anything (after step l), either in room_4 (which we are) or purple_ball_1 is in room_4 (which it is). So that's satisfied.

Constraint 4 is satisfied in step h when holding purple_ball_1.

This approach seems to cover all constraints and the goal. Let's check the steps again for validity.

Steps:

1. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_1: Preconditions: in room_2 (yes), door connects room_2 to room_1 (yes), and no object blocking (assuming none). So valid.

2. toggle yellow_door_1: Precondition is being in front of it. After step 1, yes. So door is now unlocked.

3. gotoroom room_2 room_1 yellow_door_1: Preconditions: in room_2, adjacent to room_1 via yellow_door_1, which is unlocked. Yes. Now in room_1.

4. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_3: Preconditions: in room_1, door connects to room_3, no blocking. Valid.

5. toggle purple_door_1: Now unlocked.

6. gotoroom room_1 room_3 purple_door_1: Valid, now in room_3.

7. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_3: Valid, in room_3.

8. pick purple_ball_1 room_3: Preconditions: in room_3, not holding anything. Yes. Now holding it.

9. gotodoor green_door_2 room_3 room_4: In room_3, door connects to room_4. Valid if no object blocking.

10. toggle green_door_2: Now unlocked.

11. gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_2: Valid, now in room_4.

12. drop purple_ball_1 room_4: Preconditions: holding it, front is empty. After gotoempty? Wait, after entering room_4, the agent is not in front of any object. The effect of gotoroom is that you're no longer in front of anything. So after step 11, the agent is in room_4, not in front of anything. To drop, need to be in front of an empty position. So before dropping, need to gotoempty.

Wait, correction: After step 11 (gotoroom), the agent is in room_4 and not in front of any object. To drop, the precondition is that the position in front is empty. But the agent is not in front of anything, so maybe they need to perform gotoempty first.

So between steps 11 and 12:

11. gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_2 (now in room_4, not in front of anything)
12. gotoempty (to be in front of empty spot)
13. drop purple_ball_1 room_4 (now holding nothing, purple_ball_1 is in room_4)

Then, steps to get the yellow ball:

14. gotoobject yellow_ball_3 room_4
15. pick yellow_ball_3 room_4

This would achieve the goal. Let's check all constraints again:

- Constraint 1: Holding an object at least once. Steps 8 and 15 satisfy this.

- Constraint 2: Whenever holding, in room_4 or yellow_door_1 unlocked. When holding purple_ball_1 (steps 8-12), during that time, yellow_door_1 is unlocked (from step 1). When holding yellow_ball_3 (step 15 onwards), the agent is in room_4. So both cases satisfy.

- Constraint 3: Been in room_4 (step 11 and onwards).

- Constraint 4: Either empty in room_1 or holding purple_ball_1. Step 8 (holding purple_ball_1) satisfies this.

- Constraint 5: yellow_door_1 unlocked (step 2).

- Constraint 6: Not holding anything at step 13.

- Constraint 7: After step 13 (not holding), must be in room_4 (yes) or purple_ball_1 in room_4 (yes, since dropped there in step 13). So satisfied.

This seems to cover all constraints. Let's count the steps:

1. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_1
2. toggle yellow_door_1
3. gotoroom room_2 room_1 yellow_door_1
4. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_3
5. toggle purple_door_1
6. gotoroom room_1 room_3 purple_door_1
7. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_3
8. pick purple_ball_1 room_3
9. gotodoor green_door_2 room_3 room_4
10. toggle green_door_2
11. gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_2
12. gotoempty
13. drop purple_ball_1 room_4
14. gotoobject yellow_ball_3 room_4
15. pick yellow_ball_3 room_4

But maybe there's a shorter path. For example, if the agent can go from room_2 to room_4 via green_door_1 by unlocking it, which requires:

1. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4
2. toggle green_door_1
3. gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1
4. gotoobject yellow_ball_3 room_4
5. pick yellow_ball_3 room_4

But then, how to satisfy constraint 4 (empty in room_1 or holding purple_ball_1). In this path, the agent never holds purple_ball_1 nor goes to room_1. So need to address that.

So, perhaps the shorter path isn't possible because of constraint 4. Therefore, the first approach where the agent goes through room_1 and room_3 to pick up purple_ball_1 is necessary.

Alternatively, maybe the agent can go to room_1 and perform a gotoempty, which would satisfy the "empty is in room_1" part of constraint 4. Let's try:

Plan B:

1. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_1
2. toggle yellow_door_1
3. gotoroom room_2 room_1 yellow_door_1
4. gotoempty (now in room_1, in front of empty spot. This would satisfy constraint 4 as "empty is in room_1".)
5. gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1 (back to room_2)
6. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4
7. toggle green_door_1
8. gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1 (now in room_4)
9. gotoobject yellow_ball_3 room_4
10. pick yellow_ball_3 room_4

This plan has 10 steps. Let's check constraints:

- Constraint 4: Step 4 (gotoempty in room_1) makes "empty is in room_1" true. So that's satisfied.

Other constraints:

- Constraint 2: When holding yellow_ball_3 (step 10), the agent is in room_4, so condition met.

- Constraint 3: Step 8 (in room_4).

- Constraint 5: Step 2 (unlocked yellow_door_1).

- Constraint 6: Must have a state where not holding. But in this plan, after step 4, the agent is not holding anything (only picked up in step 10). So step 5-9 are not holding. So constraint 6 is satisfied.

- Constraint 7: Whenever not holding, either in room_4 or purple_ball_1 in room_4. After step 4, the agent is in room_1 (not room_4) and purple_ball_1 is still in room_3. So this would violate constraint 7. Because when the agent is not holding anything (steps 1-9 except step 10), during steps 5-8, the agent is not in room_4. For example, after step 5, the agent is in room_2. At that state, not holding anything, so must satisfy that in some state after, the agent is in room_4 or purple_ball_1 is in room_4. Since the agent later goes to room_4 (step 8), that satisfies the "some state after s" part. So the constraint is satisfied because eventually, the agent reaches room_4.

But the constraint is: if in state s, the agent is not holding anything, then in s or some state after, either in room_4 or purple_ball_1 in room_4. So for each state where the agent is not holding anything, there must be a subsequent state where one of those is true.

In Plan B, after step 4, the agent is in room_1, not holding anything. Then they go back to room_2 (step 5), then unlock green_door_1 (steps 6-7), then go to room_4 (step 8). So in the state after step 4 (room_1, not holding), eventually they reach room_4 (step 8), which satisfies the constraint. For other states where they are not holding, like after step 5 (room_2, not holding), the subsequent step is step 6, then step 8, which brings them to room_4. So all those states eventually reach room_4, satisfying the constraint.

This plan seems shorter (10 steps) and satisfies all constraints. But why didn't I think of this earlier? Because I thought constraint 4 required either holding purple_ball_1 or empty in room_1. If doing a gotoempty in room_1 counts as "empty is in room_1", then this plan works.

But what does "empty is in room_1" mean? The problem's objects include "empty_0 empty". So maybe "empty is in room_1" refers to the empty_0 object being in room_1. If empty_0 is not in room_1 initially, then moving it there isn't possible because it's not an object that can be moved. Or maybe "empty is in room_1" refers to having an empty position, which is always true, but the constraint requires that it must be in room_1. If the agent performs gotoempty in room_1, that action makes the agent be in front of an empty position in room_1. Perhaps this satisfies the condition that "empty is in room_1".

Assuming that, then Plan B is valid and shorter. Let's verify all constraints again with Plan B:

1. "you are holding some object" in step 10.

2. When holding in step 10, agent is in room_4, which satisfies constraint 2.

3. "you are in room_4" in step 8.

4. "empty is in room_1" or holding purple_ball_1. Step 4's gotoempty in room_1 satisfies "empty is in room_1".

5. "yellow_door_1 is not locked" in step 2.

6. "you are not holding any object" in steps 1-9 (except 10), e.g., step 4.

7. When not holding (step 4), eventually in room_4 (step 8), so satisfies.

This plan is shorter and meets all constraints. But does it require any additional steps? Let's check the steps again:

1. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_1
2. toggle yellow_door_1
3. gotoroom room_2 room_1 yellow_door_1 (now in room_1)
4. gotoempty (now in front of empty in room_1)
5. gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1 (back to room_2)
6. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4
7. toggle green_door_1
8. gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1 (now in room_4)
9. gotoobject yellow_ball_3 room_4
10. pick yellow_ball_3 room_4

Wait, after step 5, the agent is back in room_2. Then steps 6-8 unlock green_door_1 and go to room_4. Then pick up yellow_ball_3. This seems valid.

But when the agent is in room_4 and wants to pick up the ball, they need to be in front of it. So step 9 is necessary.

Yes, this plan seems to work. But let's ensure that all preconditions are met:

Step 1: goto door yellow_door_1 in room_2. Preconditions: in room_2 (yes), door connects room_2 and room_1 (yes), no object blocking (assuming yes).

Step 2: toggle door. Precondition: in front of door (yes after step 1).

Step 3: go to room_1. Preconditions: door is unlocked (yes after step 2).

Step 4: gotoempty. Valid anytime.

Step 5: go back to room_2 via yellow_door_1. Door is unlocked.

Step 6: goto door green_door_1 in room_2. Preconditions: in room_2, door connects to room_4, no blocking.

Step 7: toggle door (unlock).

Step 8: go to room_4. Preconditions: door is unlocked.

Step 9: gotoobject yellow_ball_3 in room_4. Precondition: in room_4 (yes).

Step 10: pick up. Preconditions: in room_4, not holding anything (yes).

This plan is valid and shorter. So this is the optimal plan.

But wait, after step 4, the agent is in room_1, in front of an empty spot. Then step 5: gotoroom from room_1 to room_2. That's allowed because yellow_door_1 is unlocked.

Yes.

So this plan satisfies all constraints and is shorter. Therefore, this is the optimal plan.
