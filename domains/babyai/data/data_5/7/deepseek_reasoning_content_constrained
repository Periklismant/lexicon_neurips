Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. So, the goal is to have a blue box in front of me, and there are several constraints that must be met during the plan. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the initial state: I'm in room_1. There are two blue boxes here, blue_box_1 and blue_box_2. The final goal is to have a blue box (any of them) in front of me. So, maybe I can just pick one of the blue boxes in room_1 and drop it in front of me. Wait, but the constraints might complicate things.

Let's look at the constraints. There are five constraints that need to be satisfied at some point in the plan:

1. At least one state where blue_box_1 is in room_3 OR I'm in front of grey_box_1.
2. At least one state where I'm holding blue_box_3 AND yellow_door_2 is unlocked.
3. At least one state where I'm in front of yellow_door_1.
4. At least one state where I'm in room_4 AND holding some object.
5. At least one state where I'm in front of grey_box_1 OR red_door_1 is unlocked.

So, the plan must include actions that ensure each of these constraints is met at some point. Let's see how to integrate these.

Starting with the main goal: getting a blue box in front of me. The easiest way seems to be to pick up blue_box_1 or blue_box_2 in room_1 and then drop it. But dropping requires being in front of an empty position. Wait, but the 'drop' action's precondition is that I'm holding the object and the position in front is empty. So, after picking up the box, I need to 'gotoempty' to move to an empty spot, then drop it. Wait, no: 'drop x r' requires that after 'gotoempty', I'm in front of an empty position, then drop x there. Wait, the 'drop' action's effect is that x is placed in the room, and I'm in front of it. So maybe the steps would be: pick up the box, then 'gotoempty' (to move away from the original position), then drop the box. But no, after picking up, I'm not in front of the box anymore. Wait, the 'pick' action's effect is that you are no longer in front of x. So after picking, you need to go to an empty spot, then drop. But why not just drop it where you are? Wait, the 'drop' action's precondition is that the position in front of you is empty. Wait, when you perform 'drop', you have to be in front of an empty position. Wait, the 'drop' action's description says: you may only drop x if (i) you are holding x and (ii) the position in front of you is empty. So to drop, you need to be in front of an empty spot. So after picking up the box, you need to 'gotoempty' to move to an empty spot, then drop the box there. Then, after dropping, you'll be in front of the box, satisfying the goal.

But the problem is that the initial blue boxes are already in room_1, where I am. So maybe the simplest plan is:

1. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1
2. pick blue_box_1 room_1
3. gotoempty
4. drop blue_box_1 room_1

But this would achieve the goal. However, this doesn't satisfy any of the constraints. So the constraints require that during the plan, certain conditions must be met.

Let's look at each constraint:

Constraint 1: blue_box_1 in room_3 OR in front of grey_box_1. Since grey_box_1 is in room_4, which is the southeast room, to get in front of it, I need to go to room_4. But all doors are initially locked. So that's a problem. Alternatively, moving blue_box_1 to room_3. But how?

Constraint 2: Holding blue_box_3 and yellow_door_2 is unlocked. Blue_box_3 is in room_3. So I need to unlock yellow_door_2 (which connects room_1 and room_3). Then go to room_3, pick up blue_box_3. So this would require toggling yellow_door_2.

Constraint 3: Be in front of yellow_door_1. Yellow_door_1 connects room_1 and room_2. So I can go to it from room_1.

Constraint 4: Be in room_4 and holding something. So I need to carry an object into room_4. Maybe after unlocking the doors leading there.

Constraint 5: Be in front of grey_box_1 (which is in room_4) or have red_door_1 unlocked. Red_door_1 connects room_2 and room_4. So if I unlock red_door_1, that could satisfy this.

But all doors are initially locked. So I need to unlock them. But to unlock a door, I need to be in front of it and toggle it. So to unlock yellow_door_1, I need to go in front of it (from room_1) and toggle it. Similarly for others.

So maybe the plan needs to involve unlocking doors, moving through rooms, and handling objects in a way that satisfies all constraints.

Let's outline a possible path:

1. From room_1, go to yellow_door_1 (constraint 3). Then toggle it to unlock. Now yellow_door_1 is unlocked. Then go to room_2 via yellow_door_1. But why? Because in room_2, there's purple_box_1 and green_ball_1. Maybe pick up something there. But constraint 4 requires being in room_4 while holding something. So maybe go to room_4 via room_2 and red_door_1. But red_door_1 is locked. So need to unlock it. To unlock red_door_1, I need to be in front of it. Which room is red_door_1 in? It connects room_2 and room_4. So from room_2, I can go to red_door_1. Then toggle it to unlock. Then go to room_4. Then maybe pick up grey_box_1 or blue_ball_1. But constraint 4 requires being in room_4 and holding something. So perhaps after entering room_4, pick up an object there. Then that satisfies constraint 4.

But let's consider all steps:

First, handle constraint 3: be in front of yellow_door_1. So from room_1, gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2. But to do that, need to check if the position in front of the door in room_1 is not blocked. The initial state says that objects can block doors. So in room_1, are there any objects blocking yellow_door_1? The initial objects in room_1 are blue_box_1 and blue_box_2. Are they blocking doors? The problem statement says that doors can be blocked by objects. Wait, the preconditions for "gotodoor d r1 r2" require that (ii) there is no object blocking the position in front of d in the current room. So if in room_1, the position in front of yellow_door_1 is blocked by an object, then I can't go there. But in the initial state, are any objects blocking doors?

The initial state doesn't mention any objects blocking doors. So I assume that the doors are not blocked. So in room_1, I can go to yellow_door_1. Then toggle it (unlock), then go to room_2. But maybe first I need to unlock the doors.

Wait, all doors are locked initially. So to use gotoroom, the door must be unlocked. So first, I need to toggle the doors to unlock them. So steps:

1. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2 (from room_1, so possible)
2. toggle yellow_door_1 (now unlocked)
3. gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1 (enter room_2)

But why go to room_2? Because room_2 has purple_box_1 and green_ball_1. Also, room_2 is connected to room_4 via red_door_1. So maybe in room_2, unlock red_door_1.

But first, after step 3, we are in room_2. Then:

4. gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_4
5. toggle red_door_1 (unlock)
6. gotoroom room_2 room_4 red_door_1 (enter room_4)

Now in room_4. Here, there's blue_ball_1 and grey_box_1. Let's pick one of them to satisfy constraint 4 (be in room_4 and holding something).

7. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_4
8. pick grey_box_1 room_4 (now holding it, which satisfies constraint 4)
But wait, to pick, I need to be in the same room as the object and not holding anything. Since after step 6, I'm in room_4, and not holding anything. So steps 7 and 8 are possible. So after step 8, constraint 4 is satisfied.

But also, constraint 5 requires either being in front of grey_box_1 or red_door_1 unlocked. Since we just unlocked red_door_1 in step 5, that satisfies the second part of constraint 5. So constraint 5 is satisfied when red_door_1 is unlocked (step 5). So that's covered.

Now, let's also consider constraint 1: either blue_box_1 in room_3 or in front of grey_box_1. If I go to grey_box_1 in room_4, then that would satisfy the second part. But in step 7, I went to grey_box_1, so after step 7, I'm in front of it, which would satisfy constraint 1. So that's covered.

But maybe I need to check if during the plan, any of these states occur. Let's see:

- When I'm in front of grey_box_1 (step 7), that satisfies constraint 1 (second condition) and constraint 5 (first condition). So that's good.

Now, constraint 2: holding blue_box_3 and yellow_door_2 is unlocked. Blue_box_3 is in room_3. So I need to go to room_3, unlock yellow_door_2 (which connects room_1 and room_3), then pick up blue_box_3.

But how to get to room_3. Let's see: from room_4, the doors are red_door_1 (to room_2) and green_door_1 (to room_3). But green_door_1 is initially locked. So maybe unlock green_door_1.

But let's backtrack. After step 8, I'm holding grey_box_1 in room_4. To satisfy constraint 2, I need to hold blue_box_3 and have yellow_door_2 unlocked.

So let's proceed:

After step 8, in room_4, holding grey_box_1. We need to drop it somewhere, perhaps.

But let's think: To get to room_3, maybe from room_4, use green_door_1. But green_door_1 is locked. So need to unlock it.

9. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3 (from room_4, possible if not blocked)
10. toggle green_door_1 (unlock)
11. gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1 (enter room_3)
12. drop grey_box_1 room_3 (if needed, but maybe not necessary)
But perhaps we need to go to room_3, but to pick blue_box_3, we need to be in room_3 and not holding anything.

Wait, constraint 2 requires that at some point I'm holding blue_box_3 and yellow_door_2 is unlocked. So yellow_door_2 connects room_1 and room_3. So I need to unlock yellow_door_2. To do that, I need to be in front of it. Which can be done from room_1 or room_3.

But currently, after step 11, I'm in room_3. Let's see:

In room_3, the objects are yellow_ball_1 and blue_box_3. But to unlock yellow_door_2, which connects room_1 and room_3, I need to be in room_1 or room_3 and go to the door. So from room_3, gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_3 room_1. Then toggle it.

But initially, yellow_door_2 is locked. So steps:

From room_3:

13. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_3 room_1
14. toggle yellow_door_2 (unlock)
15. Now, yellow_door_2 is unlocked. Then, to pick blue_box_3, I need to be in room_3 and not holding anything. So if I drop grey_box_1 in room_3 first:

12. drop grey_box_1 room_3 (if I'm holding it)
Then:

13. gotoobject blue_box_3 room_3
14. pick blue_box_3 room_3 (now holding it)
At this point, if yellow_door_2 is unlocked (step 14), then constraint 2 is satisfied (holding blue_box_3 and yellow_door_2 is unlocked).

But wait, step 14 is the toggle action to unlock yellow_door_2. So after step 14, yellow_door_2 is unlocked. Then, after step 14, I can pick blue_box_3. So steps:

After entering room_3 (step 11), I'm holding grey_box_1. So I need to drop it first.

12. drop grey_box_1 room_3 (now in front of it)
13. gotoempty
14. gotoobject blue_box_3 room_3
15. pick blue_box_3 room_3 (now holding it)
But before that, need to unlock yellow_door_2. So after step 11 (in room_3), I need to unlock yellow_door_2.

So after step 11:

12. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_3 room_1
13. toggle yellow_door_2 (unlock)
14. Now, constraint 2 is satisfied when I pick blue_box_3 (step 15) after this.

So during step 15, I'm holding blue_box_3 and yellow_door_2 is unlocked. So that satisfies constraint 2.

Now, after that, maybe I can proceed to drop blue_box_3 somewhere. But the main goal is to have a blue box in front of me. Since blue_box_3 is blue, if I drop it in room_3 and then be in front of it, that would work. But the initial blue boxes are in room_1. So perhaps the plan can end with me dropping blue_box_3 in front of myself in room_3, but the goal is any blue box. Alternatively, maybe using the initial blue boxes in room_1 is easier.

But let's consider the path so far. The constraints are:

Constraint 1: met when I was in front of grey_box_1 (step 7)

Constraint 2: met when I pick blue_box_3 after unlocking yellow_door_2 (steps 13 and 15)

Constraint 3: met when I went to yellow_door_1 in step 1.

Constraint 4: met in step 8 (in room_4, holding grey_box_1)

Constraint 5: met when red_door_1 was unlocked (step 5)

So all constraints are satisfied. Now, the main goal is to have a blue box in front of me. So after step 15, I'm holding blue_box_3 (which is blue). Then I can drop it in room_3.

16. gotoempty (to move to an empty spot)
17. drop blue_box_3 room_3

Now, after dropping, I'm in front of blue_box_3, which is blue. So that satisfies the goal.

But wait, the goal is "there is a box v such that v is blue and you are in front of v". So in this case, after step 17, that's achieved.

Alternatively, maybe using the initial blue boxes in room_1 is shorter, but considering the constraints, the path through room_4 and room_3 is necessary to meet all constraints.

But let's check if there's a shorter path. Let's count the steps so far:

1. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2
2. toggle yellow_door_1
3. gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1
4. gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_4
5. toggle red_door_1
6. gotoroom room_2 room_4 red_door_1
7. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_4
8. pick grey_box_1 room_4 (constraint 4)
9. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3
10. toggle green_door_1
11. gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1
12. drop grey_box_1 room_3
13. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_3 room_1
14. toggle yellow_door_2
15. gotoobject blue_box_3 room_3
16. pick blue_box_3 room_3 (constraint 2)
17. gotoempty
18. drop blue_box_3 room_3

That's 18 actions. Maybe there's a shorter path.

Alternatively, could I unlock yellow_door_2 from room_1 first, then go to room_3, pick up blue_box_3, and then return to room_1 to drop it? Let's see:

Alternative approach:

1. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_1 room_3
2. toggle yellow_door_2 (unlock)
3. gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_2 (enter room_3)
4. gotoobject blue_box_3 room_3
5. pick blue_box_3 room_3 (now holding it; constraint 2 is met here)
6. gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_2 (back to room_1)
7. gotoempty
8. drop blue_box_3 room_1

But this would require steps:

But wait, this path doesn't satisfy other constraints. For example, constraint 3: being in front of yellow_door_1. So in this approach, I haven't gone to yellow_door_1. So I need to also go there. So steps:

After step 8 (dropping blue_box_3 in room_1), the goal is met. But need to include steps to meet all constraints.

So in this alternative plan, how to meet all constraints?

Constraint 1: blue_box_1 in room_3 or in front of grey_box_1. If I don't move blue_box_1, then I need to be in front of grey_box_1. But grey_box_1 is in room_4. So to get there, I need to unlock doors. For example, red_door_1 or green_door_1.

But in this alternative plan, after step 8, the main goal is achieved. But the constraints require:

Constraint 1: need to have blue_box_1 in room_3 or be in front of grey_box_1. Since blue_box_1 is in room_1 initially, unless I move it to room_3, I need to be in front of grey_box_1. But to get to grey_box_1, I need to go to room_4, which requires unlocking red_door_1 or green_door_1. So perhaps in this alternative plan, after step 8, I need to go to room_4 and be in front of grey_box_1. But that would add more steps.

Alternatively, move blue_box_1 to room_3. But that requires carrying it through doors. Let's see:

From room_1, take blue_box_1 to room_3. Steps:

1. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1
2. pick blue_box_1 room_1
3. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_1 room_3
4. toggle yellow_door_2 (unlock)
5. gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_2 (now in room_3)
6. drop blue_box_1 room_3 (now blue_box_1 is in room_3, satisfying constraint 1)
7. Then proceed to pick blue_box_3 and meet other constraints.

But this approach requires more steps and may complicate meeting other constraints. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe combine the two approaches. Let's think:

Original plan with 18 steps meets all constraints. Maybe it's the shortest possible. But maybe there's a more optimal path.

Another angle: The main goal can be achieved in room_1 with blue_box_1 or blue_box_2. So if I can satisfy all constraints while moving around, perhaps a shorter plan exists.

For example:

1. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1 (in front of it)
2. pick blue_box_1 room_1 (now holding it)
3. gotoempty (now in front of empty spot)
4. drop blue_box_1 room_1 (now in front of it, goal achieved)

But this is 4 actions. However, none of the constraints are met. So we need to include actions to meet the constraints.

So perhaps during the plan, after achieving the goal, we have to do extra steps to meet the constraints, but that's not allowed because the plan must end when the goal is achieved. Wait, no. The plan must bring about the goal, and all constraints must be met in at least one state during the plan. So the constraints can be met before the goal is achieved.

So perhaps the plan can first meet all constraints, then achieve the goal.

But how?

For example:

- Unlock yellow_door_1 (meets constraint 3 when going to it)
- Unlock red_door_1 (meets constraint 5 when unlocked)
- Go to room_4, pick up an object (meets constraint 4)
- Go to room_3, unlock yellow_door_2, pick blue_box_3 (meets constraint 2)
- Then go back to room_1, drop blue_box_1 (meeting the goal)

But this seems longer. Let's outline:

1. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2
2. toggle yellow_door_1 (unlock; constraint 3 met at step 1)
3. gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1 (enter room_2)
4. gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_4
5. toggle red_door_1 (unlock; constraint 5 met at step 5)
6. gotoroom room_2 room_4 red_door_1 (enter room_4)
7. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_4
8. pick grey_box_1 room_4 (constraint 4 met here)
9. drop grey_box_1 room_4 (optional)
10. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3
11. toggle green_door_1 (unlock)
12. gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1 (enter room_3)
13. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_3 room_1
14. toggle yellow_door_2 (unlock)
15. gotoobject blue_box_3 room_3
16. pick blue_box_3 room_3 (constraint 2 met here)
17. gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_2 (back to room_1)
18. gotoempty
19. drop blue_box_3 room_1 (now in front of it, goal met)

But this is 19 steps, which is longer than the previous approach. So perhaps the first approach is better.

But maybe there's a way to overlap meeting multiple constraints with the same action. For example, when in room_4 holding grey_box_1 (step 8), that meets constraint 4. Also, being in front of grey_box_1 (step 7) meets constraint 1 and 5 (if grey_box_1 is in room_4). So step 7 satisfies constraint 1 (second condition) and constraint 5 (first condition). So that's efficient.

Similarly, unlocking red_door_1 (step 5) meets constraint 5 (second condition). So whichever comes first, but both are covered.

The first approach seems to cover all constraints with fewer steps. Let's recount:

Steps in the first approach:

1. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2 (constraint 3)
2. toggle yellow_door_1 (unlock)
3. gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1 (enter room_2)
4. gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_4
5. toggle red_door_1 (unlock; constraint 5)
6. gotoroom room_2 room_4 red_door_1 (enter room_4)
7. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_4 (constraint 1 and 5)
8. pick grey_box_1 room_4 (constraint 4)
9. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3
10. toggle green_door_1 (unlock)
11. gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1 (enter room_3)
12. drop grey_box_1 room_3
13. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_3 room_1
14. toggle yellow_door_2 (unlock)
15. gotoobject blue_box_3 room_3
16. pick blue_box_3 room_3 (constraint 2)
17. gotoempty
18. drop blue_box_3 room_3 (now in front of it, goal met)

But steps 12-18 are needed to handle blue_box_3. Alternatively, after step 11 (in room_3), maybe:

12. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_3 room_1
13. toggle yellow_door_2 (unlock)
14. gotoobject blue_box_3 room_3
15. pick blue_box_3 room_3 (constraint 2)
16. gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_2 (back to room_1)
17. gotoempty
18. drop blue_box_3 room_1

But this way, the goal is achieved in room_1. However, in this case, after step 18, the agent is in front of blue_box_3 in room_1, which satisfies the goal. But this requires moving back to room_1.

But the blue_box_3 is blue, so that's valid. However, in the initial state, blue_box_3 is in room_3. So to drop it in room_1, the agent must carry it there. That's possible.

So let's adjust the steps:

After step 11 (in room_3):

12. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_3 room_1
13. toggle yellow_door_2 (unlock)
14. gotoobject blue_box_3 room_3
15. pick blue_box_3 room_3 (constraint 2 met)
16. gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_2 (back to room_1)
17. gotoempty
18. drop blue_box_3 room_1 (now in front of it)

This is 18 steps again. So whether the agent drops the box in room_3 or room_1, the steps are similar.

But is there a way to reduce the number of steps?

Wait, perhaps after step 8 (holding grey_box_1 in room_4), instead of going to room_3, maybe go back to room_2, then to room_1, and then proceed to room_3 via yellow_door_2.

But that might add more steps. Let's think:

After step 8 (in room_4 holding grey_box_1):

9. gotoroom room_4 room_2 red_door_1 (back to room_2)
10. drop grey_box_1 room_2
11. gotoroom room_2 room_1 yellow_door_1 (back to room_1)
12. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_1 room_3
13. toggle yellow_door_2 (unlock)
14. gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_2 (enter room_3)
15. gotoobject blue_box_3 room_3
16. pick blue_box_3 room_3 (constraint 2)
17. gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_2 (back to room_1)
18. gotoempty
19. drop blue_box_3 room_1 (goal met)

But this adds more steps (19 instead of 18). So not better.

Alternatively, after step 8, drop grey_box_1 in room_4:

9. drop grey_box_1 room_4 (now in front of it)
10. gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2
11. toggle red_door_1 (already unlocked, so locks it again? Wait, no. Toggle action toggles the state. So step 5 was unlocking red_door_1, so it's unlocked. Toggling again would lock it. But we need to keep it unlocked for constraints. Hmm, this could be a problem.

Wait, step 5 toggled red_door_1 from locked to unlocked. If we later toggle it again, it would lock it, which might interfere with other steps. But in the current plan, after step 5, we don't need to use red_door_1 again, so it's okay. But if we go back through red_door_1, we have to make sure it's still unlocked.

But in the current plan, after step 8, if we drop grey_box_1 in room_4, then we can proceed to room_2 via red_door_1 (which is unlocked). So:

9. drop grey_box_1 room_4 (in front of it)
10. gotoroom room_4 room_2 red_door_1 (back to room_2)
11. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_1
12. gotoroom room_2 room_1 yellow_door_1 (back to room_1)
13. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_1 room_3
14. toggle yellow_door_2 (unlock)
15. gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_2 (enter room_3)
16. gotoobject blue_box_3 room_3
17. pick blue_box_3 room_3 (constraint 2)
18. gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_2 (back to room_1)
19. gotoempty
20. drop blue_box_3 room_1

This is 20 steps, which is worse. So not better.

Original plan of 18 steps seems more optimal. Now, can we find a shorter path?

Wait, what if after unlocking yellow_door_1 and red_door_1, and going to room_4, then go back to room_2 and then to room_1, and then unlock yellow_door_2 from room_1.

But I'm not sure. Let me think again.

Alternative approach:

1. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2 (constraint 3)
2. toggle yellow_door_1 (unlock)
3. gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1 (enter room_2)
4. gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_4
5. toggle red_door_1 (unlock; constraint 5)
6. gotoroom room_2 room_4 red_door_1 (enter room_4)
7. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_4 (constraint 1 and 5)
8. pick grey_box_1 room_4 (constraint 4)
9. gotoroom room_4 room_2 red_door_1 (back to room_2)
10. drop grey_box_1 room_2
11. gotoroom room_2 room_1 yellow_door_1 (back to room_1)
12. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_1 room_3
13. toggle yellow_door_2 (unlock)
14. gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_2 (enter room_3)
15. gotoobject blue_box_3 room_3
16. pick blue_box_3 room_3 (constraint 2)
17. gotoroom room_3 room_1 yellow_door_2 (back to room_1)
18. gotoempty
19. drop blue_box_3 room_1 (goal met)

This is 19 steps. Not better than 18. So original plan seems better.

Another idea: After unlocking green_door_1 in room_4, perhaps use it to go to room_3, then unlock yellow_door_2 from room_3.

But the original plan already does that.

Alternatively, in room_3, after unlocking yellow_door_2, pick blue_box_3 and go back to room_1 to drop it. But that's what the original plan does.

So the original plan of 18 steps seems necessary to meet all constraints and achieve the goal.

Therefore, the valid plan is as follows:

```
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2
toggle yellow_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1
gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_4
toggle red_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_4 red_door_1
gotoobject grey_box_1 room_4
pick grey_box_1 room_4
gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3
toggle green_door_1
gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1
drop grey_box_1 room_3
gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_3 room_1
toggle yellow_door_2
gotoobject blue_box_3 room_3
pick blue_box_3 room_3
gotoempty
drop blue_box_3 room_3
```

Wait, but in this plan, after dropping blue_box_3 in room_3, the agent is in front of it, which meets the goal. Let's verify each constraint:

- Constraint 1: When the agent was in front of grey_box_1 in room_4 (step 7), that's true.
- Constraint 2: When the agent picked blue_box_3 (step 15), yellow_door_2 was unlocked (step 14), so condition holds.
- Constraint 3: When the agent went to yellow_door_1 in step 1.
- Constraint 4: When the agent was holding grey_box_1 in room_4 (step 8).
- Constraint 5: When red_door_1 was unlocked (step 5), which satisfies the second part of the condition.

So all constraints are met. The goal is achieved in the last step (step 17, but in the written plan above it's step 16). Wait, the steps above are:

1. gotodoor yellow_door_1...
2. toggle...
3. gotoroom...
4. gotodoor red_door_1...
5. toggle...
6. gotoroom...
7. gotoobject...
8. pick...
9. gotodoor...
10. toggle...
11. gotoroom...
12. drop...
13. gotodoor...
14. toggle...
15. gotoobject...
16. pick...
17. gotoempty...
18. drop...

Ah, so in this plan, the drop is step 18. So 18 actions. But in the written plan above, the steps are 16? Let me recount:

Wait, the written plan after the first line:

Lines:

gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2 (1)
toggle yellow_door_1 (2)
gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1 (3)
gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_4 (4)
toggle red_door_1 (5)
gotoroom room_2 room_4 red_door_1 (6)
gotoobject grey_box_1 room_4 (7)
pick grey_box_1 room_4 (8)
gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3 (9)
toggle green_door_1 (10)
gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1 (11)
drop grey_box_1 room_3 (12)
gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_3 room_1 (13)
toggle yellow_door_2 (14)
gotoobject blue_box_3 room_3 (15)
pick blue_box_3 room_3 (16)
gotoempty (17)
drop blue_box_3 room_3 (18)

Yes, 18 steps. So this plan meets all constraints and achieves the goal in 18 steps. But the user asked for an optimal plan with the shortest possible length. Is there a way to make it shorter?

Let's think: Can any steps be merged or omitted?

For example, after step 12 (drop grey_box_1 in room_3), is it necessary to drop it? Or can the agent carry grey_box_1 to room_3 and then drop it later? But in step 8, the agent is holding grey_box_1, which is needed for constraint 4. After that, to pick blue_box_3, the agent must drop grey_box_1 first. So steps 12 (drop) is necessary.

Another optimization: After step 14 (toggle yellow_door_2), the agent is in front of it. Then, can the agent immediately pick blue_box_3 without moving? No, because the agent is in front of the door, not the object. So they need to gotoobject blue_box_3 room_3 (step 15).

Alternatively, can the agent be in front of the door and then move to the object? Yes, which is what's done.

Another possible optimization: After step 11 (enter room_3), the agent can directly go to blue_box_3, but they need to first unlock yellow_door_2. So steps 13-14 are needed.

Hmm. I don't see a way to shorten the plan further. Therefore, this 18-step plan seems to be the optimal one.
