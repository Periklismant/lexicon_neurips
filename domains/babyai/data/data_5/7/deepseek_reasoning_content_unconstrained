Okay, let's see. The goal is to have a blue box in front of me. The initial state is that I'm in room_1, and there are two blue boxes here: blue_box_1 and blue_box_2. Both are in room_1. So maybe I can just go to one of them and drop them? Wait, but wait, the problem says I need to have a blue box in front of me. But initially, the blue boxes are already in room_1. Wait, but the goal is "There is a box v such that 'v is blue' and 'you are in front of v'". So maybe I just need to go in front of one of those boxes. Since they are already in room_1, where I am.

So the initial state says I'm in room_1. The preconditions for gotoobject x r: I can only go to x if I'm in the same room as x. So since I'm in room_1 and the blue boxes are there, I can just do "gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1". That should satisfy the goal, right? Because then I'm in front of a blue box.

Wait, but let's check the constraints. The user mentioned constraints, but in the problem description, the constraints section is empty. So maybe there are no additional constraints beyond the preconditions of the actions. So the plan would be straightforward.

But wait, the initial state says that all doors are locked. So if I need to move between rooms, I have to unlock doors. But since the blue boxes are already in room_1, maybe I don't need to move. So the plan would be just to go to one of the blue boxes in room_1.

But let's check the initial position. The user is in room_1. The blue_box_1 and blue_box_2 are in room_1. So the action "gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1" is possible. The preconditions are that I'm in the same room as the object, which I am. Then after that action, I'm in front of blue_box_1, which is blue, so the goal is achieved. The plan is just one action. But wait, is there any reason why that wouldn't work?

Wait, the problem states that the initial state has all doors locked. But since I'm already in room_1 with the boxes, maybe I don't need to open any doors. Let me check the actions' preconditions again. The "gotoobject" action requires being in the same room as the object, which is true. There's no mention of needing doors to be unlocked if staying in the same room. So yes, this action is valid.

Therefore, the optimal plan is just one step: gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1. That's the shortest possible plan. Alternatively, using blue_box_2 would also work. But since the plan needs to be optimal, the shortest possible length is 1. So that's the answer.
