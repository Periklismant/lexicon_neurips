Okay, let's tackle this planning problem step by step. The goal is to end up in front of a yellow ball. The initial state has me in room_2 with several objects, and all doors are locked. The constraints require that at some point I'm holding an object, in front of blue_door_3, in room_3 with yellow_ball_1 there, in room_1, and that purple_ball_1 is in room_3.

First, I need to unlock doors to move around. All doors are locked, so I need to toggle them. But to toggle a door, I have to be in front of it. But doors might be blocked by objects. The initial room (room_2) has yellow_ball_1, grey_box_1, yellow_box_1, and grey_box_2. The doors connected to room_2 are blue_door_1 (to room_1) and blue_door_3 (to room_4). Wait, but the problem says room_2 is connected to room_4 via blue_door_3. So in room_2, blue_door_3 is present, but if there's an object blocking it, I can't go to the door. The initial state doesn't mention any door being blocked, but the "goto door" action requires that the position in front of the door isn't blocked. So in room_2, if the door blue_door_3 is blocked by an object, I can't go there. But the initial objects in room_2 are balls and boxes. Are any of them blocking the door? The problem statement doesn't specify, but since the preconditions for "goto door" require that there's no object blocking the position in front of the door, I have to assume that initially, those doors are not blocked. Wait, the problem statement's initial state doesn't mention any door being blocked. So maybe the doors are not blocked, so I can go to them.

So, first step: I need to unlock the doors to move. Let's see. Starting in room_2. The doors connected are blue_door_1 (to room_1) and blue_door_3 (to room_4). Both are locked. So to move from room_2 to another room, I need to unlock their doors. But to unlock a door, I need to be in front of it and toggle it. So first, I need to go to the door in room_2, toggle it, then go through.

But wait, the constraints require that I must be in front of blue_door_3 at some point. Also, the plan needs to have me in room_1 at some point, and in room_3 with yellow_ball_1 there, and purple_ball_1 in room_3.

The goal is to have a yellow ball in front of me. The yellow balls are yellow_ball_1 (initially in room_2) and yellow_ball_2 (in room_3). The final goal is to be in front of a yellow ball, which could be either. But let's check the constraints. One of them is that at some state, purple_ball_1 is in room_3. Purple_ball_1 is initially in room_4. So to get it to room_3, I need to move it. Also, another constraint is that I'm holding some object at some point, which suggests I need to pick up and drop something.

Additionally, another constraint requires that in some state, I'm in room_3 with yellow_ball_1 there. Yellow_ball_1 starts in room_2, so I need to move it to room_3. That implies I need to pick it up in room_2, carry it through doors to room_3, and drop it there.

So the plan must include moving yellow_ball_1 from room_2 to room_3. Also, moving purple_ball_1 from room_4 to room_3. To do that, I need to go to room_4, pick up purple_ball_1, bring it to room_3. But how to get to room_4? From room_2, via blue_door_3. But blue_door_3 is locked. So first, go to blue_door_3 in room_2, toggle it to unlock, then go to room_4. Then, in room_4, pick up purple_ball_1, then return to room_2, then go to room_3? Wait, but how to get to room_3. From room_2, the connected rooms are room_1 and room_4. To get to room_3, maybe via room_1. Because room_1 is connected to room_3 via blue_door_2, which is locked. So I need to unlock that as well.

Alternatively, room_4 is connected to room_3 via green_door_1, which is locked. So to get from room_4 to room_3, I need to unlock green_door_1. But green_door_1 is in room_3 and room_4. So perhaps go to room_4, then go to green_door_1 (if possible), unlock it, then go to room_3.

But let's outline the steps needed:

1. Unlock blue_door_3 (room_2 to room_4) to get to room_4, which is necessary to pick up purple_ball_1.

But also, to get to room_3 from room_2, maybe via room_1 and room_3. Let's see. From room_2, blue_door_1 connects to room_1, but it's locked. So need to unlock blue_door_1 as well. Then go to room_1, then unlock blue_door_2 (connecting room_1 to room_3), then go to room_3.

But there's also a door between room_3 and room_4 (green_door_1). So perhaps after getting to room_3, unlock green_door_1 to go to room_4.

But let's consider the constraints:

- Must be in room_1 at some point. So the plan must include visiting room_1.

- Must be in room_3 with yellow_ball_1 there. So need to move yellow_ball_1 from room_2 to room_3.

- Must have purple_ball_1 in room_3. So need to move it from room_4 to room_3.

So steps:

1. In room_2, unlock blue_door_3 (to room_4) and blue_door_1 (to room_1), then go to room_1 to unlock blue_door_2 (to room_3), then proceed.

But this seems complicated. Let's think of a path.

First, starting in room_2. To unlock blue_door_1 (connects to room_1), I need to go to it. So:

Action: gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1

But wait, the "gotodoor" syntax is "gotodoor d r1 r2", but according to the action definition: "gotodoor d r1 r2": Go in front of door d, connecting room r1 to r2. Wait, but the initial connections are room_2 and room_1 connected via blue_door_1. So in room_2, the door is blue_door_1 connecting to room_1. So to go to the door in room_2, I need to do "gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1". Then, toggle it to unlock.

Same for blue_door_3 in room_2 (connects to room_4). So "gotodoor blue_door_3 room_2 room_4".

But the problem is that all doors are initially locked, so even if I go to them, I need to toggle them to unlock. But each toggle changes the state (locked/unlocked). So first, I need to be in front of the door, then toggle it to unlock.

So step by step:

1. In room_2, go to blue_door_1 (room_2 to room_1). Since the door is locked, but the action is gotodoor. Wait, the precondition for gotodoor is that you are in a room connected by the door and no object is blocking the position. Since initial state doesn't mention any blocking, we can proceed.

Action: gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1

Then toggle it: toggle blue_door_1

Now blue_door_1 is unlocked. Then, we can go to room_1 via gotoroom room_2 room_1 blue_door_1.

But the constraint requires being in room_1 at some point. So that's good. Then, in room_1, we can go to blue_door_2 (connecting to room_3), toggle it to unlock. Then proceed to room_3.

But perhaps another approach is needed. Let's see the constraints again. We need to have purple_ball_1 in room_3. So we need to get to room_4 where purple_ball_1 is, pick it up, and bring it to room_3.

So steps:

- From room_2, unlock blue_door_3 (to room_4). To do that:

goto blue_door_3 in room_2, toggle to unlock.

Then go to room_4.

In room_4, pick up purple_ball_1. Then, we need to get it to room_3. To get to room_3 from room_4, the door is green_door_1, which is locked. So need to unlock green_door_1.

But to unlock green_door_1, need to go to it. In room_4, the door connecting to room_3 is green_door_1. So in room_4, do gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3, then toggle to unlock. Then go to room_3 via green_door_1.

Once in room_3, drop purple_ball_1. That satisfies the constraint of purple_ball_1 in room_3.

But also, we need to get yellow_ball_1 to room_3. So perhaps after handling purple_ball_1, go back to room_2, pick up yellow_ball_1, then move it to room_3 via room_1.

Wait, but moving from room_2 to room_1 requires blue_door_1, which we can unlock. Then from room_1 to room_3 via blue_door_2. But blue_door_2 is initially locked. So we need to unlock that as well.

Alternatively, from room_3 to room_4 via green_door_1, but that's perhaps a longer path.

Let me outline the steps more clearly:

1. Unlock blue_door_3 (room_2 to room_4):

   - goto blue_door_3 in room_2: gotodoor blue_door_3 room_2 room_4

   - toggle blue_door_3 (unlocks it)

   - then goto room_4 via blue_door_3: gotoroom room_2 room_4 blue_door_3

   Now in room_4. Need to get purple_ball_1 here. Pick it up.

2. In room_4:

   - gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4

   - pick purple_ball_1 room_4 (now holding it)

   Now need to get to room_3. To do that, need to unlock green_door_1 (connects room_4 to room_3). So:

   - gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3

   - toggle green_door_1 (unlock)

   - gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1 (now in room_3)

   - drop purple_ball_1 room_3 (now purple_ball_1 is in room_3, satisfying one constraint)

3. Now, need to get yellow_ball_1 from room_2 to room_3. So return to room_2.

   Path from room_3 to room_2: room_3 to room_4 via green_door_1 (unlocked), then room_4 to room_2 via blue_door_3 (unlocked). But that's a longer path. Alternatively, unlock blue_door_2 (connecting room_1 to room_3) to go via room_1.

   But first, need to unlock blue_door_2. Let's think:

   From room_3, can I go to room_1 via blue_door_2? The door is locked. So need to unlock it.

   To unlock blue_door_2, need to be in room_1 or room_3. Because blue_door_2 connects room_1 and room_3.

   So if I go to room_1, then unlock blue_door_2.

   How to get to room_1? Currently in room_3. From room_3, the connected doors are blue_door_2 (to room_1) and green_door_1 (to room_4). Blue_door_2 is locked, so need to unlock it.

   Wait, but to unlock blue_door_2, I need to be in front of it. So from room_3, if I can go to blue_door_2:

   gotodoor blue_door_2 room_3 room_1

   But is the door present in room_3? The problem says room_3 is connected to room_1 via blue_door_2. So in room_3, blue_door_2 is present. Then, assuming no objects blocking, I can go to it.

   So:

   - In room_3: gotodoor blue_door_2 room_3 room_1

   - toggle blue_door_2 (unlock)

   Then, can go to room_1 via blue_door_2.

   But then from room_1, blue_door_1 connects to room_2. If blue_door_1 is already unlocked (if we did that earlier). Wait, earlier steps: initially, we only unlocked blue_door_3. Blue_door_1 is still locked. So to get from room_1 to room_2, need to unlock blue_door_1.

   Wait, earlier steps: Did we unlock blue_door_1? No. Because in the first step, after thinking, I considered unlocking blue_door_3 first. So in the initial plan steps, blue_door_1 is still locked. So to get from room_3 to room_2 via room_1, we need to unlock blue_door_1 as well.

   So let's adjust:

   After unlocking blue_door_3 and moving to room_4, then to room_3, then to room_1:

   Let's see:

   Maybe after dropping purple_ball_1 in room_3, the next step is to unlock blue_door_2 to get to room_1.

   So:

   From room_3:

   - gotodoor blue_door_2 room_3 room_1

   - toggle blue_door_2 (unlocks it)

   - gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_2 (now in room_1)

   Now, in room_1. This satisfies the constraint of being in room_1.

   From room_1, need to unlock blue_door_1 to get back to room_2. So:

   - gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2

   - toggle blue_door_1 (unlocks it)

   - gotoroom room_1 room_2 blue_door_1 (back to room_2)

   Now, in room_2. Need to pick up yellow_ball_1 and take it to room_3.

   So:

   - gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2

   - pick yellow_ball_1 room_2 (now holding it)

   Now, need to go to room_3. Path: room_2 -> room_1 (blue_door_1), room_1 -> room_3 (blue_door_2). So:

   - gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1 (already unlocked)

   - gotoroom room_2 room_1 blue_door_1 (to room_1)

   - gotodoor blue_door_2 room_1 room_3 (unlocked earlier)

   - gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_2 (to room_3)

   Now in room_3. Drop yellow_ball_1:

   - gotoempty (to find a spot to drop)

   - drop yellow_ball_1 room_3

   Now, yellow_ball_1 is in room_3, satisfying the constraint.

   Now, the goal is to be in front of a yellow ball. The current room_3 has yellow_ball_2 and green_box_1. Also, we just dropped yellow_ball_1 here. So we can just gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_3.

   But wait, the goal is to have the agent in front of a yellow ball. So after dropping yellow_ball_1 in room_3, we can gotoobject it.

   But the final action would be "gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_3".

   However, after dropping the ball, the agent is no longer in front of it (since drop action makes you in front of x, but if you drop, you are in front of it. Wait, the effect of drop is: (i) you are no longer carrying x, (ii) you are in front of x, (iii) hands empty, (iv) x is in current room. So when you drop x in room r, you end up in front of x. Therefore, after dropping yellow_ball_1 in room_3, you are already in front of it. So maybe the last action is the drop, which already satisfies the goal.

   Wait, the goal is "There is a ball v such that v is yellow and you are in front of v". So after dropping yellow_ball_1 in room_3, you are in front of it, so the goal is achieved. Therefore, the plan can end there.

   Let's check all constraints:

   1. Must hold an object at some state: yes, when we picked up purple_ball_1 and yellow_ball_1.

   2. Must be in front of blue_door_3 at some state: when we initially went to blue_door_3 in room_2, that action would make us in front of it.

   3. Must be in room_3 with yellow_ball_1 there: after dropping it in room_3, that's true.

   4. Must be in room_1: yes, when we went from room_3 to room_1.

   5. Must have purple_ball_1 in room_3: yes, after dropping it there.

   So this plan seems to satisfy all constraints and the goal.

   Let's outline the full plan step by step:

   1. goto blue_door_3 in room_2:

      Action: gotodoor blue_door_3 room_2 room_4

   2. toggle blue_door_3 (unlocks it)

      Action: toggle blue_door_3

   3. go to room_4 via blue_door_3

      Action: gotoroom room_2 room_4 blue_door_3

   4. goto purple_ball_1 in room_4

      Action: gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4

   5. pick purple_ball_1

      Action: pick purple_ball_1 room_4

      Now holding it (satisfies holding constraint)

   6. goto green_door_1 in room_4 (connecting to room_3)

      Action: gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3

   7. toggle green_door_1 (unlock)

      Action: toggle green_door_1

   8. go to room_3 via green_door_1

      Action: gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1

   9. drop purple_ball_1 in room_3

      Action: drop purple_ball_1 room_3

      Now in front of it. Purple_ball_1 is in room_3.

   10. goto blue_door_2 in room_3 (connecting to room_1)

       Action: gotodoor blue_door_2 room_3 room_1

   11. toggle blue_door_2 (unlock)

       Action: toggle blue_door_2

   12. go to room_1 via blue_door_2

       Action: gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_2

       Now in room_1 (satisfies the room_1 constraint)

   13. goto blue_door_1 in room_1 (connecting to room_2)

       Action: gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2

   14. toggle blue_door_1 (unlock)

       Action: toggle blue_door_1

   15. go to room_2 via blue_door_1

       Action: gotoroom room_1 room_2 blue_door_1

   16. goto yellow_ball_1 in room_2

       Action: gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2

   17. pick yellow_ball_1 room_2

       Now holding it.

   18. goto blue_door_1 in room_2 (connecting to room_1)

       Action: gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1

   19. go to room_1 via blue_door_1

       Action: gotoroom room_2 room_1 blue_door_1

   20. goto blue_door_2 in room_1 (connecting to room_3)

       Action: gotodoor blue_door_2 room_1 room_3

   21. go to room_3 via blue_door_2

       Action: gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_2

   22. drop yellow_ball_1 in room_3

       Action: drop yellow_ball_1 room_3

       Now in front of yellow_ball_1 in room_3. Goal achieved.

   Now, let's check if all constraints are met:

   - Holding an object: yes, steps 5 and 17.

   - In front of blue_door_3: step 1.

   - In room_3 with yellow_ball_1: after step 22.

   - In room_1: step 12.

   - purple_ball_1 in room_3: step 9.

   All constraints satisfied. The final state has the agent in front of yellow_ball_1 in room_3, so the goal is achieved.

   Let's verify the action sequence:

   The steps are:

   1. gotodoor blue_door_3 room_2 room_4

   2. toggle blue_door_3

   3. gotoroom room_2 room_4 blue_door_3

   4. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4

   5. pick purple_ball_1 room_4

   6. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3

   7. toggle green_door_1

   8. gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1

   9. drop purple_ball_1 room_3

   10. gotodoor blue_door_2 room_3 room_1

   11. toggle blue_door_2

   12. gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_2

   13. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2

   14. toggle blue_door_1

   15. gotoroom room_1 room_2 blue_door_1

   16. gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2

   17. pick yellow_ball_1 room_2

   18. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1

   19. gotoroom room_2 room_1 blue_door_1

   20. gotodoor blue_door_2 room_1 room_3

   21. gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_2

   22. drop yellow_ball_1 room_3

   This is 22 actions. But maybe there's a shorter path.

   Wait, after step 9 (dropping purple_ball_1 in room_3), perhaps there's a way to go directly to room_2 without going through room_1. But room_3 is connected to room_4 via green_door_1 (unlocked), and room_4 to room_2 via blue_door_3 (unlocked). So from room_3, go to room_4, then to room_2. That might save steps.

   Let me see. After step 8 (in room_3):

   9. drop purple_ball_1 room_3

   10. gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_1 (back to room_4)

   11. gotoroom room_4 room_2 blue_door_3

   Now back in room_2. Then proceed to pick yellow_ball_1.

   But then, when moving from room_2 to room_1, need to unlock blue_door_1. So steps:

   Alternative path:

   After step 9:

   10. gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4 (but we are in room_3, so door is room_3 to room_4 via green_door_1)

   Wait, no. To go back to room_4, use green_door_1 from room_3.

   So:

   10. gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_1

   11. In room_4, then go to room_2 via blue_door_3:

       gotodoor blue_door_3 room_4 room_2 (but door is in room_4?)

       Wait, the door blue_door_3 connects room_2 and room_4. So in room_4, the door is blue_door_3, connecting to room_2.

       So gotodoor blue_door_3 room_4 room_2

       Then gotoroom room_4 room_2 blue_door_3.

   So steps:

   After step 9:

   10. gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_1

   11. gotodoor blue_door_3 room_4 room_2

   12. gotoroom room_4 room_2 blue_door_3

   13. Now in room_2.

   Then proceed to pick yellow_ball_1.

   This way, we don't need to go through room_1. But then, we need to satisfy the constraint of being in room_1. So this approach skips room_1, which is a constraint. So we still need to visit room_1.

   Therefore, the initial path that goes through room_1 is necessary to meet the constraint.

   Alternatively, after step 9, go back to room_4, then to room_2, then unlock blue_door_1 and go to room_1.

   Let's see:

   After step 9 (in room_3):

   10. gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_1

   11. gotodoor blue_door_3 room_4 room_2

   12. gotoroom room_4 room_2 blue_door_3

   13. In room_2, then unlock blue_door_1 (room_2 to room_1)

       gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1

       toggle blue_door_1

       gotoroom room_2 room_1 blue_door_1

       Now in room_1 (satisfies constraint)

   Then from room_1, unlock blue_door_2 (room_1 to room_3)

       gotodoor blue_door_2 room_1 room_3

       toggle blue_door_2

       gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_2

   Then in room_3, proceed to drop yellow_ball_1.

   But this path would require:

   After step 13 (back in room_2):

   14. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1

   15. toggle blue_door_1

   16. gotoroom room_2 room_1 blue_door_1 (now in room_1)

   17. gotodoor blue_door_2 room_1 room_3

   18. toggle blue_door_2

   19. gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_2 (now in room_3)

   Now in room_3, need to drop yellow_ball_1, but we haven't picked it up yet. Wait, yellow_ball_1 is in room_2. So after step 13 (in room_2), pick yellow_ball_1:

   14. gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2

   15. pick yellow_ball_1 room_2

   16. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1

   17. gotoroom room_2 room_1 blue_door_1 (now in room_1)

   18. gotodoor blue_door_2 room_1 room_3

   19. toggle blue_door_2

   20. gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_2

   21. drop yellow_ball_1 room_3

   This way, the steps are longer but maybe shorter than the initial path. Let's count:

   Original path steps: 22.

   This alternative path:

   Steps:

   1. gotodoor blue_door_3 room_2 room_4

   2. toggle blue_door_3

   3. gotoroom room_2 room_4 blue_door_3

   4. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4

   5. pick purple_ball_1 room_4

   6. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3

   7. toggle green_door_1

   8. gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1

   9. drop purple_ball_1 room_3

   10. gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_1

   11. gotodoor blue_door_3 room_4 room_2

   12. gotoroom room_4 room_2 blue_door_3

   13. gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2

   14. pick yellow_ball_1 room_2

   15. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1

   16. toggle blue_door_1

   17. gotoroom room_2 room_1 blue_door_1

   18. gotodoor blue_door_2 room_1 room_3

   19. toggle blue_door_2

   20. gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_2

   21. drop yellow_ball_1 room_3

   That's 21 steps. But wait, in step 15, after picking yellow_ball_1, to go to blue_door_1, you need to be in front of it. So between step 14 and 15:

   After step 14 (picked yellow_ball_1), you are not in front of blue_door_1. So you need to goto blue_door_1.

   So step 15: gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1

   Then step 16: toggle blue_door_1 (but you're already in front of it after step 15.

   So steps:

   13. gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2

   14. pick yellow_ball_1 room_2

   15. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1

   16. toggle blue_door_1

   17. gotoroom room_2 room_1 blue_door_1

   So that adds steps, making it 21 steps. But in the original path, it was 22 steps. So this alternative is shorter by one step.

   But the initial plan was longer. Maybe there's a more optimal path.

   Alternatively, after dropping purple_ball_1 in room_3, go back to room_4, then to room_2, pick yellow_ball_1, then take it to room_3 via room_4 and green_door_1. But that requires:

   After step 9 (dropped purple_ball_1 in room_3):

   10. gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_1

   11. gotodoor blue_door_3 room_4 room_2

   12. gotoroom room_4 room_2 blue_door_3

   13. gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2

   14. pick yellow_ball_1 room_2

   15. gotodoor blue_door_3 room_2 room_4

   16. gotoroom room_2 room_4 blue_door_3

   17. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3

   18. gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1

   19. drop yellow_ball_1 room_3

   This path would have 19 steps. But does this satisfy all constraints?

   Let's see:

   - Holding an object: steps 5 and 14.

   - In front of blue_door_3: steps 1 and 15.

   - In room_3 with yellow_ball_1: step 19.

   - In room_1: no. So this path doesn't satisfy the room_1 constraint.

   So this path is invalid because it skips visiting room_1.

   Therefore, the original path with visiting room_1 is necessary.

   So perhaps the initial plan of 22 steps is necessary. But maybe there's a way to optimize.

   Let's re-examine the initial plan:

   After dropping purple_ball_1 in room_3 (step 9), proceed to unlock blue_door_2 from room_3 to room_1 (steps 10-11), go to room_1 (step 12), unlock blue_door_1 (steps 13-14), go back to room_2 (step 15), pick yellow_ball_1 (steps 16-17), then go to room_1 (steps 18-19), then to room_3 (steps 20-21), drop it (step 22).

   Can we combine some steps? For example, after unlocking blue_door_1 and returning to room_2, can we directly go to room_1 without using the door again?

   Wait, step 15: in room_1 after step 14 (unlocking blue_door_1), but no, step 15 is going from room_1 back to room_2. Then, step 16 is in room_2 again.

   Hmm. It's a bit complicated. Maybe this is the optimal path given the constraints.

   Now, to write the actions correctly, ensuring all preconditions are met each step.

   For example, when using "gotoobject", the agent must be in the same room as the object. So when in room_4, gotobject purple_ball_1 is allowed.

   Also, when dropping an object, the agent must be holding it and in front of an empty spot. The "drop" action's precondition is that you are holding the object and the position in front is empty. Wait, no: the preconditions for drop are (i) holding x, (ii) position in front is empty. So when you perform "drop x r", you need to be in front of an empty spot. But the drop action's effect is that you are in front of x after dropping. So to drop, you must first gotoempty.

   Wait, the "drop" action's preconditions are: (i) currently holding x, (ii) the position in front is empty.

   The effect is: you are no longer carrying x, you are in front of x, hands empty, x is in current room.

   So to drop x, you must first be in front of an empty position. Therefore, before dropping, you need to perform "gotoempty".

   Oh, this is a crucial point I missed earlier. So in the earlier plan, after moving to room_3 and wanting to drop purple_ball_1, I need to gotoempty first, then drop.

   This changes the plan. Let's re-examine step 9 in the initial plan:

   After step 8, you are in room_3. Then you need to drop purple_ball_1. But you are currently in front of green_door_1 (since you just went through it to room_3). So to drop, you need to:

   - gotoempty (step 9)

   - drop purple_ball_1 room_3 (step 10)

   So this adds a step. Similarly, when dropping yellow_ball_1, you need to gotoempty first.

   So this changes the action count. Let's adjust the initial plan.

   Revised steps:

   1. gotodoor blue_door_3 room_2 room_4

   2. toggle blue_door_3

   3. gotoroom room_2 room_4 blue_door_3

   4. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4

   5. pick purple_ball_1 room_4

   6. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3

   7. toggle green_door_1

   8. gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1

   9. gotoempty

   10. drop purple_ball_1 room_3

   11. gotodoor blue_door_2 room_3 room_1

   12. toggle blue_door_2

   13. gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_2

   14. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2

   15. toggle blue_door_1

   16. gotoroom room_1 room_2 blue_door_1

   17. gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2

   18. pick yellow_ball_1 room_2

   19. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1

   20. gotoroom room_2 room_1 blue_door_1

   21. gotodoor blue_door_2 room_1 room_3

   22. gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_2

   23. gotoempty

   24. drop yellow_ball_1 room_3

   Now, the final action (drop) puts you in front of yellow_ball_1, satisfying the goal. But this adds two more steps (9 and 23). Now total steps are 24. But wait, after entering room_3 from green_door_1, the agent is in front of green_door_1. To drop, need to gotoempty. Similarly, after entering room_3 from blue_door_2, need to gotoempty to drop.

   Alternatively, when you enter a room through a door, you are in front of the door. So after step 8 (gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1), you are in front of green_door_1. To drop, you need to move to an empty spot.

   So yes, step 9 is gotoempty.

   This means the initial plan missed these steps, making it invalid. So the correct plan must include these gotoempty steps before dropping.

   Similarly, after step 22 (gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_2), you are in front of blue_door_2 in room_3. To drop yellow_ball_1, need to gotoempty first.

   So the revised plan would be:

   Actions:

   1. gotodoor blue_door_3 room_2 room_4

   2. toggle blue_door_3

   3. gotoroom room_2 room_4 blue_door_3

   4. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4

   5. pick purple_ball_1 room_4

   6. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3

   7. toggle green_door_1

   8. gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1

   9. gotoempty

   10. drop purple_ball_1 room_3

   11. gotodoor blue_door_2 room_3 room_1

   12. toggle blue_door_2

   13. gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_2

   14. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2

   15. toggle blue_door_1

   16. gotoroom room_1 room_2 blue_door_1

   17. gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2

   18. pick yellow_ball_1 room_2

   19. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1

   20. gotoroom room_2 room_1 blue_door_1

   21. gotodoor blue_door_2 room_1 room_3

   22. gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_2

   23. gotoempty

   24. drop yellow_ball_1 room_3

   Now, the constraints are still met. But this increases the number of steps. Is there a way to optimize this?

   For example, after step 8 (in front of green_door_1 in room_3), can I directly gotoempty in room_3 without moving? Yes. So step 9 is gotoempty.

   Similarly, after step 22 (in front of blue_door_2 in room_3), gotoempty (step 23), then drop.

   Alternatively, perhaps there's a way to drop without gotoempty by being in front of an empty spot after moving. For example, after entering a room via a door, you are in front of the door. If there's an empty spot nearby, you can gotoempty. But according to the problem statement, "gotoempty" allows you to go to any empty position in the room. So yes.

   Now, this plan includes all necessary steps. However, it's longer than before. But since the problem requires an optimal plan (shortest possible), we need to check if there's a shorter way.

   Alternative approach:

   Maybe instead of moving purple_ball_1 and yellow_ball_1 separately, can I carry both? No, because you can only hold one object at a time.

   Another idea: After dropping purple_ball_1 in room_3, instead of going back to room_2 to get yellow_ball_1, can I use yellow_ball_2 which is already in room_3? The goal is to be in front of any yellow ball. yellow_ball_2 is in room_3 initially. So if I can get to room_3 and gotoobject yellow_ball_2, that would satisfy the goal without needing to move yellow_ball_1.

   But the constraint requires that in some state, I'm in room_3 with yellow_ball_1 there. So even if I use yellow_ball_2 for the goal, I still need to move yellow_ball_1 to room_3.

   So that constraint is necessary.

   So perhaps the optimal path is to move yellow_ball_1 to room_3 and use it for the goal.

   But what if the goal can be achieved with yellow_ball_2 in room_3, and I satisfy the other constraints separately?

   Let's see:

   The goal is to have a yellow ball in front of me. If I go to room_3 and gotoobject yellow_ball_2 (which is already there), then the goal is achieved. But I still need to move yellow_ball_1 to room_3 for the constraint.

   So I need to do both: move purple_ball_1 to room_3 and yellow_ball_1 to room_3.

   So even if I achieve the goal with yellow_ball_2, the constraint requires yellow_ball_1 to be in room_3 at some point. So I must move yellow_ball_1 there.

   So regardless, I need to move both purple_ball_1 and yellow_ball_1 to room_3.

   Therefore, the plan must involve both actions.

   But what if I move yellow_ball_1 to room_3 first, then purple_ball_1?

   Let's see. Starting in room_2:

   Unlock blue_door_1 (room_2 to room_1), go to room_1, unlock blue_door_2 (room_1 to room_3), go to room_3, drop yellow_ball_1 there. Then go to room_4 via green_door_1 (unlock it), pick purple_ball_1, bring it back to room_3.

   This might involve fewer steps.

   Let's outline:

   1. goto blue_door_1 room_2 room_1

   2. toggle blue_door_1 (unlock)

   3. goto room_1

   4. goto blue_door_2 room_1 room_3

   5. toggle blue_door_2 (unlock)

   6. goto room_3

   7. gotoempty

   8. drop (but no object yet)

   Wait, this path doesn't involve picking up yellow_ball_1 yet. So steps:

   1. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1

   2. toggle blue_door_1

   3. gotoroom room_2 room_1 blue_door_1

   4. gotodoor blue_door_2 room_1 room_3

   5. toggle blue_door_2

   6. gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_2

   7. Now in room_3. Need to get yellow_ball_1 here.

   But yellow_ball_1 is in room_2. So go back to room_2:

   7. gotodoor blue_door_2 room_3 room_1

   8. gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_2

   9. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2

   10. gotoroom room_1 room_2 blue_door_1

   11. gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2

   12. pick yellow_ball_1 room_2

   13. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1

   14. gotoroom room_2 room_1 blue_door_1

   15. gotodoor blue_door_2 room_1 room_3

   16. gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_2

   17. gotoempty

   18. drop yellow_ball_1 room_3

   Now, yellow_ball_1 is in room_3. Then, proceed to handle purple_ball_1:

   19. gotodoor blue_door_2 room_3 room_1

   20. gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_2

   21. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2

   22. gotoroom room_1 room_2 blue_door_1

   23. gotodoor blue_door_3 room_2 room_4

   24. toggle blue_door_3

   25. gotoroom room_2 room_4 blue_door_3

   26. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4

   27. pick purple_ball_1 room_4

   28. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3

   29. toggle green_door_1

   30. gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1

   31. gotoempty

   32. drop purple_ball_1 room_3

   This is 32 steps, which is longer than the previous plan. So this approach is worse.

   Therefore, the initial plan, even with the added gotoempty steps, might still be the shortest.

   Let's recheck the revised initial plan with 24 steps:

   Steps 1-24:

   Including all necessary gotoempty and drop actions.

   Now, the constraints:

   - Holding an object: steps 5 and 18.

   - In front of blue_door_3: step 1.

   - In room_3 with yellow_ball_1: step 24.

   - In room_1: step 13.

   - purple_ball_1 in room_3: step 10.

   All constraints met.

   The goal is achieved in step 24, where the agent is in front of yellow_ball_1.

   Now, the final plan would be as follows:

   ```
   gotodoor blue_door_3 room_2 room_4
   toggle blue_door_3
   gotoroom room_2 room_4 blue_door_3
   gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4
   pick purple_ball_1 room_4
   gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3
   toggle green_door_1
   gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1
   gotoempty
   drop purple_ball_1 room_3
   gotodoor blue_door_2 room_3 room_1
   toggle blue_door_2
   gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_2
   gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2
   toggle blue_door_1
   gotoroom room_1 room_2 blue_door_1
   gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2
   pick yellow_ball_1 room_2
   gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1
   gotoroom room_2 room_1 blue_door_1
   gotodoor blue_door_2 room_1 room_3
   gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_2
   gotoempty
   drop yellow_ball_1 room_3
   ```

   Let's count the actions:

   1. gotodoor blue_door_3 room_2 room_4

   2. toggle blue_door_3

   3. gotoroom room_2 room_4 blue_door_3

   4. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4

   5. pick purple_ball_1 room_4

   6. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3

   7. toggle green_door_1

   8. gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1

   9. gotoempty

   10. drop purple_ball_1 room_3

   11. gotodoor blue_door_2 room_3 room_1

   12. toggle blue_door_2

   13. gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_2

   14. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2

   15. toggle blue_door_1

   16. gotoroom room_1 room_2 blue_door_1

   17. gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2

   18. pick yellow_ball_1 room_2

   19. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1

   20. gotoroom room_2 room_1 blue_door_1

   21. gotodoor blue_door_2 room_1 room_3

   22. gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_2

   23. gotoempty

   24. drop yellow_ball_1 room_3

   This is 24 steps. However, perhaps some steps can be optimized. For example, after step 20 (in room_1), steps 21 and 22 can be combined if the door is already unlocked. But blue_door_2 was unlocked in step 12.

   Also, after step 20, the agent is in room_1. To go to room_3, they need to goto blue_door_2 (already unlocked) and go through.

   So steps 21: gotodoor blue_door_2 room_1 room_3

   Step 22: gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_2

   Step 23: gotoempty

   Step 24: drop.

   This seems necessary.

   Is there a way to avoid some steps? For example, after step 18 (picking yellow_ball_1), can I go directly to room_3 through a different path?

   For instance, from room_2, unlock blue_door_3 and go to room_4, then to room_3 via green_door_1. But that would require unlocking green_door_1, which is already done in step 7.

   So after step 18 (holding yellow_ball_1 in room_2):

   19. gotodoor blue_door_3 room_2 room_4

   20. gotoroom room_2 room_4 blue_door_3

   21. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3

   22. gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1

   23. gotoempty

   24. drop yellow_ball_1 room_3

   This path is shorter. Let's see:

   Steps after step 18 (holding yellow_ball_1):

   19. gotodoor blue_door_3 room_2 room_4

   20. gotoroom room_2 room_4 blue_door_3

   21. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3

   22. gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1

   23. gotoempty

   24. drop yellow_ball_1 room_3

   This skips the need to go through room_1 again. But we still need to have visited room_1 for the constraint. So this approach would miss the room_1 constraint.

   Therefore, this path is invalid.

   Thus, the initial plan with 24 steps seems necessary.

   However, perhaps there's a way to visit room_1 earlier. For example, after unlocking blue_door_1 in step 15, the agent is in room_1. This satisfies the room_1 constraint. So steps 13-16 are:

   13. gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_2

   14. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2

   15. toggle blue_door_1

   16. gotoroom room_1 room_2 blue_door_1

   Step 13: in room_1 (constraint satisfied)

   So step 13 is when the agent is in room_1.

   Thus, the plan meets the room_1 constraint.

   The final plan is the 24-step sequence as outlined.
