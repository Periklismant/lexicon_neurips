Alright, so I need to find a plan that solves this gridworld problem. Let's break down the task and constraints.

The task is to:
- Be in front of a yellow ball (either yellow_ball_1 or yellow_ball_2).

The constraints are:
1. At some point, I must be holding an object.
2. At some point, I must be in front of blue_door_3.
3. At some point, both I and yellow_ball_1 must be in room_3.
4. At some point, I must be in room_1.
5. At some point, purple_ball_1 must be in room_3.

Let's start by understanding the current state:
1. I am in room_2.
2. yellow_ball_1 is in room_2, and it's yellow.
3. yellow_ball_2 is in room_3, and it's yellow.
4. purple_ball_1 is in room_4, and it's purple.
5. All doors are locked: blue_door_1 (between room_1 and room_2), blue_door_2 (between room_1 and room_3), blue_door_3 (between room_2 and room_4), and green_door_1 (between room_3 and room_4).

Given the constraints, I need to:
1. Go to room_1 at some point.
2. Go to room_3 and bring yellow_ball_1 there.
3. Go to room_3 and bring purple_ball_1 there.
4. End up in front of a yellow ball.

Let's plan this step by step:

1. First, I'll go to blue_door_3 in room_2 (to satisfy constraint 2).
2. I'll toggle blue_door_3 to unlock it.
3. I'll go to yellow_ball_1 in room_2.
4. I'll pick up yellow_ball_1 (to satisfy constraint 1).
5. I'll go through blue_door_3 to room_4.
6. From room_4, I'll go to purple_ball_1.
7. I'll drop yellow_ball_1 to pick up purple_ball_1.
8. I'll go to green_door_1 in room_4.
9. I'll toggle green_door_1 to unlock it.
10. I'll go to room_3 through green_door_1, carrying purple_ball_1.
11. Now I'm in room_3 with purple_ball_1 (to satisfy constraint 5).
12. I'll drop purple_ball_1 in room_3.
13. Now I'll go to blue_door_2 in room_3.
14. I'll toggle blue_door_2 to unlock it.
15. I'll go to room_1 through blue_door_2 (to satisfy constraint 4).
16. I'll go to blue_door_1 in room_1.
17. I'll toggle blue_door_1 to unlock it.
18. I'll go to room_2 through blue_door_1.
19. I'll go to yellow_ball_1 in room_2.
20. I'll pick up yellow_ball_1.
21. I'll go to blue_door_3 in room_2.
22. I'll go to room_4 through blue_door_3.
23. I'll go to green_door_1 in room_4.
24. I'll go to room_3 through green_door_1, carrying yellow_ball_1.
25. Now I'm in room_3 with yellow_ball_1 (to satisfy constraint 3).
26. I'll drop yellow_ball_1 in room_3.
27. I'll go to yellow_ball_1 in room_3 to be in front of a yellow ball, which will achieve the goal.

Wait, there's a flaw in this plan. After I pick up purple_ball_1 in room_4, I drop yellow_ball_1 in room_4. But this doesn't align with the constraint that at some point yellow_ball_1 is in room_3. Let me refine the plan.

But, actually, I'm also confused about how to move an object from one room to another.  I pick it up in one room.  But I can't pick up a ball in one room and drop it in another room, because moving between rooms requires a "gotoroom" action, and the effect of a "gotoroom" action is that I'm "no longer in front of" any object I was previously in front of.  So I need to pick up a ball, go to another room, and then drop the ball, with the effect being that the ball is in the new room.

Let's revise the plan:

1. First, I'll go to blue_door_3 in room_2 (to satisfy constraint 2).
2. I'll toggle blue_door_3 to unlock it.
3. I'll go to yellow_ball_1 in room_2.
4. I'll pick up yellow_ball_1 (to satisfy constraint 1).
5. I'll go to blue_door_3 in room_2.
6. I'll go through blue_door_3 to room_4.
7. I'll go to green_door_1 in room_4.
8. I'll toggle green_door_1 to unlock it.
9. I'll go to room_3 through green_door_1, carrying yellow_ball_1.
10. Now I'm in room_3 with yellow_ball_1 (to satisfy constraint 3).
11. I'll drop yellow_ball_1 in room_3.
12. I'll go to blue_door_2 in room_3.
13. I'll toggle blue_door_2 to unlock it.
14. I'll go to room_1 through blue_door_2 (to satisfy constraint 4).
15. I'll go to blue_door_1 in room_1.
16. I'll toggle blue_door_1 to unlock it.
17. I'll go to room_2 through blue_door_1.
18. I'll go to blue_door_3 in room_2.
19. I'll go to room_4 through blue_door_3.
20. I'll go to purple_ball_1 in room_4.
21. I'll pick up purple_ball_1.
22. I'll go to green_door_1 in room_4.
23. I'll go to room_3 through green_door_1, carrying purple_ball_1.
24. Now I'm in room_3 with purple_ball_1 (to satisfy constraint 5).
25. I'll drop purple_ball_1 in room_3.
26. I'll go to yellow_ball_1 in room_3 to be in front of a yellow ball, which will achieve the goal.

But I realized I can also go to yellow_ball_2 in room_3, which is also a yellow ball. So I can simplify the plan:

1. First, I'll go to blue_door_3 in room_2 (to satisfy constraint 2).
2. I'll toggle blue_door_3 to unlock it.
3. I'll go to room_4, maybe first picking up an object (to satisfy constraint 1).
4. I'll go to green_door_1 in room_4.
5. I'll toggle green_door_1 to unlock it.
6. I'll go to room_3 through green_door_1.
7. I'll go to blue_door_2 in room_3.
8. I'll toggle blue_door_2 to unlock it.
9. I'll go to room_1 through blue_door_2 (to satisfy constraint 4).
10. I'll go to blue_door_1 in room_1.
11. I'll toggle blue_door_1 to unlock it.
12. I'll go to room_2 through blue_door_1.
13. I'll go to yellow_ball_1 in room_2.
14. I'll pick up yellow_ball_1 (to satisfy constraint 1).
15. I'll go to blue_door_3 in room_2.
16. I'll go to room_4 through blue_door_3.
17. I'll go to green_door_1 in room_4.
18. I'll go to room_3 through green_door_1, carrying yellow_ball_1.
19. Now I'm in room_3 with yellow_ball_1 (to satisfy constraint 3).
20. I'll drop yellow_ball_1 in room_3.
21. I'll go to room_4 and get purple_ball_1.
22. I'll bring it to room_3 to satisfy constraint 5.
23. I'll drop purple_ball_1 in room_3.
24. I'll go to any yellow ball in room_3 (yellow_ball_1 or yellow_ball_2) to be in front of a yellow ball, which will achieve the goal.

I think I need to be a bit more precise. Let me go through the actions one by one:

1. `gotodoor blue_door_3 room_2 room_4` - Go to blue_door_3 in room_2 (to satisfy constraint 2).
2. `toggle blue_door_3` - Unlock blue_door_3.
3. `gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2` - Go to yellow_ball_1 in room_2.
4. `pick yellow_ball_1 room_2` - Pick up yellow_ball_1 (to satisfy constraint 1).
5. `gotodoor blue_door_3 room_2 room_4` - Go to blue_door_3 in room_2 while holding yellow_ball_1.
6. `gotoroom room_2 room_4 blue_door_3` - Go to room_4 through blue_door_3, carrying yellow_ball_1.
7. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3` - Go to green_door_1 in room_4 while holding yellow_ball_1.
8. `toggle green_door_1` - Unlock green_door_1.
9. `gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1` - Go to room_3 through green_door_1, carrying yellow_ball_1.
10. At this point, yellow_ball_1 is with me in room_3, which satisfies constraint 3.
11. `gotoempty` - Go to an empty position in room_3.
12. `drop yellow_ball_1 room_3` - Drop yellow_ball_1 in room_3.
13. `gotodoor blue_door_2 room_3 room_1` - Go to blue_door_2 in room_3.
14. `toggle blue_door_2` - Unlock blue_door_2.
15. `gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_2` - Go to room_1 through blue_door_2 (to satisfy constraint 4).
16. `gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2` - Go to blue_door_1 in room_1.
17. `toggle blue_door_1` - Unlock blue_door_1.
18. `gotoroom room_1 room_2 blue_door_1` - Go to room_2 through blue_door_1.
19. `gotodoor blue_door_3 room_2 room_4` - Go to blue_door_3 in room_2.
20. `gotoroom room_2 room_4 blue_door_3` - Go to room_4 through blue_door_3.
21. `gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4` - Go to purple_ball_1 in room_4.
22. `pick purple_ball_1 room_4` - Pick up purple_ball_1.
23. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3` - Go to green_door_1 in room_4 while holding purple_ball_1.
24. `gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1` - Go to room_3 through green_door_1, carrying purple_ball_1.
25. At this point, purple_ball_1 is with me in room_3, which satisfies constraint 5.
26. `gotoempty` - Go to an empty position in room_3.
27. `drop purple_ball_1 room_3` - Drop purple_ball_1 in room_3.
28. `gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_3` - Go to yellow_ball_1 in room_3 to be in front of a yellow ball, which will achieve the goal.

Hmm, I realize I need to choose between going to yellow_ball_1 or yellow_ball_2 in room_3 at the end. Given that I've already interacted with yellow_ball_1, it makes sense to go to that one in the final step.

Also, I'm concerned I might be misunderstanding some of the action names, especially "gotodoor" and "gotoobject". Let me check the descriptions more carefully.

"gotodoor d r1 r2": Go in front of door d, connecting room r1 to room r2.
"gotoobject x r": Go in front of to object x in room r.

So it seems that "gotodoor" takes the door and the two rooms it connects, while "gotoobject" takes the object and the room it's in.  Ok that's how I've been using them.

"gotodoor d r1 r2": Go in front of door d, connecting room r1 to room r2.
"gotoroom r1 r2 d": Go to room r2 from room r1 using door d.

Ok, both of those actions also seems to align with how I've been using them.

Let me refine the plan and ensure constraints:

1. `gotodoor blue_door_3 room_2 room_4` - Go to blue_door_3 in room_2 (to satisfy constraint 2).
2. `toggle blue_door_3` - Unlock blue_door_3.
3. `gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2` - Go to yellow_ball_1 in room_2.
4. `pick yellow_ball_1 room_2` - Pick up yellow_ball_1 (to satisfy constraint 1).
5. `gotodoor blue_door_3 room_2 room_4` - Go to blue_door_3 in room_2 while holding yellow_ball_1.
6. `gotoroom room_2 room_4 blue_door_3` - Go to room_4 through blue_door_3, carrying yellow_ball_1.
7. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3` - Go to green_door_1 in room_4 while holding yellow_ball_1.
8. `toggle green_door_1` - Unlock green_door_1.
9. `gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1` - Go to room_3 through green_door_1, carrying yellow_ball_1.
10. At this point, yellow_ball_1 is with me in room_3, which satisfies constraint 3.
11. `gotoempty` - Go to an empty position in room_3.
12. `drop yellow_ball_1 room_3` - Drop yellow_ball_1 in room_3.
13. `gotodoor blue_door_2 room_3 room_1` - Go to blue_door_2 in room_3.
14. `toggle blue_door_2` - Unlock blue_door_2.
15. `gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_2` - Go to room_1 through blue_door_2 (to satisfy constraint 4).
16. `gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2` - Go to blue_door_1 in room_1.
17. `toggle blue_door_1` - Unlock blue_door_1.
18. `gotoroom room_1 room_2 blue_door_1` - Go to room_2 through blue_door_1.
19. `gotodoor blue_door_3 room_2 room_4` - Go to blue_door_3 in room_2.
20. `gotoroom room_2 room_4 blue_door_3` - Go to room_4 through blue_door_3.
21. `gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4` - Go to purple_ball_1 in room_4.
22. `pick purple_ball_1 room_4` - Pick up purple_ball_1.
23. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3` - Go to green_door_1 in room_4 while holding purple_ball_1.
24. `gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1` - Go to room_3 through green_door_1, carrying purple_ball_1.
25. At this point, purple_ball_1 is with me in room_3, which satisfies constraint 5.
26. `gotoempty` - Go to an empty position in room_3.
27. `drop purple_ball_1 room_3` - Drop purple_ball_1 in room_3.
28. `gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_3` - Go to yellow_ball_1 in room_3 to be in front of a yellow ball, which will achieve the goal.

This plan should satisfy all the constraints and achieve the goal. Let's double-check:

1. At some point, I'm holding an object (steps 4 and 22).
2. At some point, I'm in front of blue_door_3 (steps 1, 5, and 19).
3. At some point, both I and yellow_ball_1 are in room_3 (after step 9 and before step 15).
4. At some point, I'm in room_1 (steps 15-18).
5. At some point, purple_ball_1 is in room_3 (after step 24).
6. The goal is to be in front of a yellow ball, which is achieved in step 28.

Actually, I'm realizing that I'm conflating the effects of actions. The gotordoor action doesn't allow me to go through the door; it only positions me in front of the door. I need to follow it with a gotoroom action to actually go through the door and to the other room.

So I'd revise the plan to be more explicit about the distinction:

Alright, I think this plan satisfies all the constraints and achieves the goal. Let's make sure the actions are executed in the correct order and with the correct arguments:

Actually I think the semantics I've been assuming for

"gotodoor d r1 r2": Go in front of door d, connecting room r1 to room r2
"gotoroom r1 r2 d": Go to room r2 from room r1 using door d

are correct.  I need to first use "gotodoor" to get in front of a door, and then use "gotoroom" to transition to the other room through the door, which needs to be unlocked.

Actually, there's one thing I noticed: in order to toggle a door, I need to be in front of it. So after going to the door, I need to toggle it before moving to the next room.

And one more thing: I think there's a more efficient version of my plan.  Let me try to find a shorter version.

1. `gotodoor blue_door_3 room_2 room_4`
2. `toggle blue_door_3`
3. `gotoroom room_2 room_4 blue_door_3`
4. `gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4`
5. `pick purple_ball_1 room_4`
6. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3`
7. `toggle green_door_1`
8. `gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1`
9. `gotoempty`
10. `drop purple_ball_1 room_3`
11. `gotodoor blue_door_2 room_3 room_1`
12. `toggle blue_door_2`
13. `gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_2`
14. `gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2`
15. `toggle blue_door_1`
16. `gotoroom room_1 room_2 blue_door_1`
17. `gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2`
18. `pick yellow_ball_1 room_2`
19. `gotodoor blue_door_3 room_2 room_4`
20. `gotoroom room_2 room_4 blue_door_3`
21. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3`
22. `gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1`
23. `gotoempty`
24. `drop yellow_ball_1 room_3`
25. `gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_3`

This plan is slightly more efficient but still meets all the constraints.

Actually, there's a problem with this plan. In constraint 3, it says, "At some point, both I and yellow_ball_1 are in room_3". However, in my current plan, I'm bringing yellow_ball_1 to room_3 only at the end. So I need to adjust the plan to bring yellow_ball_1 to room_3 first.

Also, I realized we can potentially optimize. The goal is to be in front of a yellow ball, and room_3 already has a yellow ball (yellow_ball_2). So I can directly go to room_3 and then to yellow_ball_2 to achieve the goal. But to satisfy all the constraints, I still need to do certain actions in a specific order.

Here's an updated, optimized plan:

1. `gotodoor blue_door_3 room_2 room_4` - Go to blue_door_3 in room_2 (to satisfy constraint 2).
2. `toggle blue_door_3` - Unlock blue_door_3.
3. `gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2` - Go to yellow_ball_1 in room_2.
4. `pick yellow_ball_1 room_2` - Pick up yellow_ball_1 (to satisfy constraint 1).
5. `gotodoor blue_door_3 room_2 room_4` - Go to blue_door_3 in room_2 while holding yellow_ball_1.
6. `gotoroom room_2 room_4 blue_door_3` - Go to room_4 through blue_door_3, carrying yellow_ball_1.
7. `gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4` - Go to purple_ball_1 in room_4 while holding yellow_ball_1.
8. `gotoempty` - Go to an empty position in room_4.
9. `drop yellow_ball_1 room_4` - Drop yellow_ball_1 in room_4.
10. `gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4` - Go to purple_ball_1 in room_4.
11. `pick purple_ball_1 room_4` - Pick up purple_ball_1.
12. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3` - Go to green_door_1 in room_4 while holding purple_ball_1.
13. `toggle green_door_1` - Unlock green_door_1.
14. `gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1` - Go to room_3 through green_door_1, carrying purple_ball_1.
15. At this point, purple_ball_1 is with me in room_3, which satisfies constraint 5.
16. `gotoempty` - Go to an empty position in room_3.
17. `drop purple_ball_1 room_3` - Drop purple_ball_1 in room_3.
18. `gotodoor blue_door_2 room_3 room_1` - Go to blue_door_2 in room_3.
19. `toggle blue_door_2` - Unlock blue_door_2.
20. `gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_2` - Go to room_1 through blue_door_2 (to satisfy constraint 4).
21. `gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2` - Go to blue_door_1 in room_1.
22. `toggle blue_door_1` - Unlock blue_door_1.
23. `gotoroom room_1 room_2 blue_door_1` - Go to room_2 through blue_door_1.
24. `gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_4` - Go to yellow_ball_1 in room_4.

Wait, there's an error in my plan. After going to room_2, I can't immediately go to yellow_ball_1 in room_4 because it's not in room_2. I need to go to room_4 first.

Also, I realized I've misconstrued constraint 3. It requires, "At some point, you are in room_3 and yellow_ball_1 is in room_3", which means I need to have yellow_ball_1 in room_3, not just in front of me. So I need to pick up yellow_ball_1 from room_2, go to room_3, and drop it there.

Let me revise the plan accordingly.  Actually, let me restate all the constraints and then revise the plan.

The constraints are:
1. At some point, I must be holding an object.
2. At some point, I must be in front of blue_door_3.
3. At some point, both I and yellow_ball_1 must be in room_3.
4. At some point, I must be in room_1.
5. At some point, purple_ball_1 must be in room_3.

And the goal is to be in front of a yellow ball.

So, the revised plan:

1. `gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2` - Go to yellow_ball_1 in room_2.
2. `pick yellow_ball_1 room_2` - Pick up yellow_ball_1 (to satisfy constraint 1).
3. `gotodoor blue_door_3 room_2 room_4` - Go to blue_door_3 in room_2 while holding yellow_ball_1 (to satisfy constraint 2).
4. `toggle blue_door_3` - Unlock blue_door_3.
5. `gotoroom room_2 room_4 blue_door_3` - Go to room_4 through blue_door_3, carrying yellow_ball_1.
6. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3` - Go to green_door_1 in room_4 while holding yellow_ball_1.
7. `toggle green_door_1` - Unlock green_door_1.
8. `gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1` - Go to room_3 through green_door_1, carrying yellow_ball_1.
9. At this point, both I and yellow_ball_1 are in room_3, which satisfies constraint 3.
10. `gotoempty` - Go to an empty position in room_3.
11. `drop yellow_ball_1 room_3` - Drop yellow_ball_1 in room_3.
12. `gotodoor blue_door_2 room_3 room_1` - Go to blue_door_2 in room_3.
13. `toggle blue_door_2` - Unlock blue_door_2.
14. `gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_2` - Go to room_1 through blue_door_2 (to satisfy constraint 4).
15. `gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2` - Go to blue_door_1 in room_1.
16. `toggle blue_door_1` - Unlock blue_door_1.
17. `gotoroom room_1 room_2 blue_door_1` - Go to room_2 through blue_door_1.
18. `gotodoor blue_door_3 room_2 room_4` - Go to blue_door_3 in room_2.
19. `gotoroom room_2 room_4 blue_door_3` - Go to room_4 through blue_door_3.
20. `gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4` - Go to purple_ball_1 in room_4.
21. `pick purple_ball_1 room_4` - Pick up purple_ball_1.
22. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3` - Go to green_door_1 in room_4 while holding purple_ball_1.
23. `gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1` - Go to room_3 through green_door_1, carrying purple_ball_1.
24. At this point, purple_ball_1 is with me in room_3, which satisfies constraint 5.
25. `gotoempty` - Go to an empty position in room_3.
26. `drop purple_ball_1 room_3` - Drop purple_ball_1 in room_3.
27. `gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_3` - Go to yellow_ball_1 in room_3 to be in front of a yellow ball, which will achieve the goal.

This plan satisfies all the constraints and achieves the goal.

Actually, I realized I need to be more careful using the `gotoobject` action. The agent can only go to an object if they're in the same room as it, and after using `gotoroom`, the agent is no longer in front of any object or door, as specified in the action effects: "iv) if you were in front of some object or door x0, then you are no longer in front of x0."

Let me rereview the plan:

1. `gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2` - Go to yellow_ball_1 in room_2.
2. `pick yellow_ball_1 room_2` - Pick up yellow_ball_1 (to satisfy constraint 1).
3. `gotodoor blue_door_3 room_2 room_4` - Go to blue_door_3 in room_2 while holding yellow_ball_1 (to satisfy constraint 2).
4. `toggle blue_door_3` - Unlock blue_door_3.
5. `gotoroom room_2 room_4 blue_door_3` - Go to room_4 through blue_door_3, carrying yellow_ball_1.
6. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3` - Go to green_door_1 in room_4 while holding yellow_ball_1.
7. `toggle green_door_1` - Unlock green_door_1.
8. `gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1` - Go to room_3 through green_door_1, carrying yellow_ball_1.
9. At this point, both I and yellow_ball_1 are in room_3, which satisfies constraint 3.
10. `gotoempty` - Go to an empty position in room_3.
11. `drop yellow_ball_1 room_3` - Drop yellow_ball_1 in room_3.
12. `gotodoor blue_door_2 room_3 room_1` - Go to blue_door_2 in room_3.
13. `toggle blue_door_2` - Unlock blue_door_2.
14. `gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_2` - Go to room_1 through blue_door_2 (to satisfy constraint 4).
15. `gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2` - Go to blue_door_1 in room_1.
16. `toggle blue_door_1` - Unlock blue_door_1.
17. `gotoroom room_1 room_2 blue_door_1` - Go to room_2 through blue_door_1.
18. `gotodoor blue_door_3 room_2 room_4` - Go to blue_door_3 in room_2.
19. `gotoroom room_2 room_4 blue_door_3` - Go to room_4 through blue_door_3.
20. `gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4` - Go to purple_ball_1 in room_4.
21. `pick purple_ball_1 room_4` - Pick up purple_ball_1.
22. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3` - Go to green_door_1 in room_4 while holding purple_ball_1.
23. `gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1` - Go to room_3 through green_door_1, carrying purple_ball_1.
24. At this point, purple_ball_1 is with me in room_3, which satisfies constraint 5.
25. `gotoempty` - Go to an empty position in room_3.
26. `drop purple_ball_1 room_3` - Drop purple_ball_1 in room_3.
27. `gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_3` - Go to yellow_ball_1 in room_3 to be in front of a yellow ball, which will achieve the goal.

I think this plan looks good.

One more time, let's double-check the constraints and goal:

Constraints:
1. At some point, I must be holding an object (satisfied in steps 2 and 21).
2. At some point, I must be in front of blue_door_3 (satisfied in steps 3 and 18).
3. At some point, both I and yellow_ball_1 must be in room_3 (satisfied after step 8, before step 14).
4. At some point, I must be in room_1 (satisfied after step 14, before step 17).
5. At some point, purple_ball_1 must be in room_3 (satisfied after step 23, after dropping it in step 26).

Goal: Be in front of a yellow ball (satisfied in step 27).

Perfect, I think we have a valid plan. Let's summarize it:

1. `gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2`
2. `pick yellow_ball_1 room_2`
3. `gotodoor blue_door_3 room_2 room_4`
4. `toggle blue_door_3`
5. `gotoroom room_2 room_4 blue_door_3`
6. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3`
7. `toggle green_door_1`
8. `gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1`
9. `gotoempty`
10. `drop yellow_ball_1 room_3`
11. `gotodoor blue_door_2 room_3 room_1`
12. `toggle blue_door_2`
13. `gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_2`
14. `gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2`
15. `toggle blue_door_1`
16. `gotoroom room_1 room_2 blue_door_1`
17. `gotodoor blue_door_3 room_2 room_4`
18. `gotoroom room_2 room_4 blue_door_3`
19. `gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4`
20. `pick purple_ball_1 room_4`
21. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3`
22. `gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1`
23. `gotoempty`
24. `drop purple_ball_1 room_3`
25. `gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_3`

Actually, I'm thinking it might be more efficient to drop yellow_ball_1 in room_3, and then go to yellow_ball_2 in room_3 since it's already there. Let's refine the plan:

1. `gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2`
2. `pick yellow_ball_1 room_2`
3. `gotodoor blue_door_3 room_2 room_4`
4. `toggle blue_door_3`
5. `gotoroom room_2 room_4 blue_door_3`
6. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3`
7. `toggle green_door_1`
8. `gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1`
9. `gotoempty`
10. `drop yellow_ball_1 room_3`
11. `gotodoor blue_door_2 room_3 room_1`
12. `toggle blue_door_2`
13. `gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_2`
14. `gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2`
15. `toggle blue_door_1`
16. `gotoroom room_1 room_2 blue_door_1`
17. `gotodoor blue_door_3 room_2 room_4`
18. `gotoroom room_2 room_4 blue_door_3`
19. `gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4`
20. `pick purple_ball_1 room_4`
21. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3`
22. `gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1`
23. `gotoempty`
24. `drop purple_ball_1 room_3`
25. `gotoobject yellow_ball_2 room_3`

No wait, there's something wrong here. I am supposed to have yellow_ball_2 in room_3, but it's unclear if that's true in the initial state. Let me go back to the problem and check.

Original state:
"yellow_ball_1 is in room_2"
"yellow_ball_2 is in room_3"

So, yes, yellow_ball_2 is already in room_3. So I can directly go to yellow_ball_2 instead of yellow_ball_1 at the end to achieve the goal.

1. `gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2`
2. `pick yellow_ball_1 room_2`
3. `gotodoor blue_door_3 room_2 room_4`
4. `toggle blue_door_3`
5. `gotoroom room_2 room_4 blue_door_3`
6. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3`
7. `toggle green_door_1`
8. `gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1`
9. `gotoempty`
10. `drop yellow_ball_1 room_3`
11. `gotodoor blue_door_2 room_3 room_1`
12. `toggle blue_door_2`
13. `gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_2`
14. `gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2`
15. `toggle blue_door_1`
16. `gotoroom room_1 room_2 blue_door_1`
17. `gotodoor blue_door_3 room_2 room_4`
18. `gotoroom room_2 room_4 blue_door_3`
19. `gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4`
20. `pick purple_ball_1 room_4`
21. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3`
22. `gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1`
23. `gotoempty`
24. `drop purple_ball_1 room_3`
25. `gotoobject yellow_ball_2 room_3`

Actually, there might be an even more optimal solution. Instead of going to yellow_ball_2 at the end, I could go to yellow_ball_1, which is in room_3, which is what I already planned to do. I think that's actually more optimal.

25. `gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_3`

So the final plan is:

1. `gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2`
2. `pick yellow_ball_1 room_2`
3. `gotodoor blue_door_3 room_2 room_4`
4. `toggle blue_door_3`
5. `gotoroom room_2 room_4 blue_door_3`
6. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3`
7. `toggle green_door_1`
8. `gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1`
9. `gotoempty`
10. `drop yellow_ball_1 room_3`
11. `gotodoor blue_door_2 room_3 room_1`
12. `toggle blue_door_2`
13. `gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_2`
14. `gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2`
15. `toggle blue_door_1`
16. `gotoroom room_1 room_2 blue_door_1`
17. `gotodoor blue_door_3 room_2 room_4`
18. `gotoroom room_2 room_4 blue_door_3`
19. `gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4`
20. `pick purple_ball_1 room_4`
21. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3`
22. `gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1`
23. `gotoempty`
24. `drop purple_ball_1 room_3`
25. `gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_3`

Actually, after reviewing the problem once more, I noticed one potentially crucial detail: The task is to bring about the situation that "There is a ball v such that "The following conditions are all true: "v is yellow", "you are in front of v"""

This means that our goal is simply to be in front of a yellow ball. Given that, instead of the complex plan, we can directly go to yellow_ball_1 in room_2, right from the start. This would achieve the goal directly, without having to navigate around the rooms.

But, the constraints complicate this straightforward approach:
1. At some point, I must be holding an object.
2. At some point, I must be in front of blue_door_3.
3. At some point, both I and yellow_ball_1 must be in room_3.
4. At some point, I must be in room_1.
5. At some point, purple_ball_1 must be in room_3.

So, I can't simply go to yellow_ball_1 in room_2. I need to navigate to different rooms and manipulate objects to satisfy these constraints.

However, I can make the solution more optimal by ensuring that I go to yellow_ball_1 in room_3 at the end to achieve the goal, as I've already planned.

25. `gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_3` or
25. `gotoobject yellow_ball_2 room_3`

Both will achieve the goal, since both are yellow balls in room_3.

Actually, I just realized. We can be a more efficient by not going to the yellow_ball after dropping the purple ball in room3. We can rearrange things such that we first pick up purple ball in room_4, move it to room3, and drop it. Then pick up the yellow ball in room_2, move it to room3, drop it, and immediately go to it. Here's the more efficient plan:

1. `gotodoor blue_door_3 room_2 room_4`
2. `toggle blue_door_3`
3. `gotoroom room_2 room_4 blue_door_3`
4. `gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4`
5. `pick purple_ball_1 room_4`
6. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3`
7. `toggle green_door_1`
8. `gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1`
9. `gotoempty`
10. `drop purple_ball_1 room_3`
11. `gotodoor blue_door_2 room_3 room_1`
12. `toggle blue_door_2`
13. `gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_2`
14. `gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2`
15. `toggle blue_door_1`
16. `gotoroom room_1 room_2 blue_door_1`
17. `gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2`
18. `pick yellow_ball_1 room_2`
19. `gotodoor blue_door_3 room_2 room_4`
20. `gotoroom room_2 room_4 blue_door_3`
21. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3`
22. `gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1`
23. `gotoempty`
24. `drop yellow_ball_1 room_3`
25. `gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_3`

Actually, let's just be extra sure of the original state and constraints. Original state:
"yellow_ball_1 is in room_2"
"yellow_ball_2 is in room_3"

So the efficient final action could be:
25. `gotoobject yellow_ball_2 room_3`

since it's already in room_3.

But we are dropping yellow_ball_1 in room_3 in step 24, it's also a yellow ball, so we can directly go to it:
25. `gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_3`

Both will achieve the goal, since both are yellow balls in room_3. This is the most efficient solution I can think of.

I think the final plan is:

1. `gotodoor blue_door_3 room_2 room_4`
2. `toggle blue_door_3`
3. `gotoroom room_2 room_4 blue_door_3`
4. `gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4`
5. `pick purple_ball_1 room_4` - holding an object (constraint 1)
6. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3`
7. `toggle green_door_1`
8. `gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1` - purple_ball_1 is in room_3 (constraint 5)
9. `gotoempty`
10. `drop purple_ball_1 room_3`
11. `gotodoor blue_door_2 room_3 room_1`
12. `toggle blue_door_2`
13. `gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_2` - in room_1 (constraint 4)
14. `gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2`
15. `toggle blue_door_1`
16. `gotoroom room_1 room_2 blue_door_1`
17. `gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2`
18. `pick yellow_ball_1 room_2` - holding an object
19. `gotodoor blue_door_3 room_2 room_4` - in front of blue_door_3 (constraint 2)
20. `gotoroom room_2 room_4 blue_door_3`
21. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3`
22. `gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1` - both in room_3 and yellow_ball_1 in room_3 (constraint 3)
23. `gotoempty`
24. `drop yellow_ball_1 room_3`
25. `gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_3` - goal achieved (in front of a yellow ball)

Actually, we have a small issue. When I drop purple_ball_1 in room_3, what if it blocks the blue_door_2?

Actually, based on the rules of the world described, I don't think this is a concern. The rules state that objects can block positions in front of doors, but are moved or are no longer in that position after they are picked up. So, when I drop purple_ball_1 in room_3, since I am in front of an empty position, it's safe to assume that it won't block a door.

So, the plan stays as it is. Let me double-check it once more:

1. `gotodoor blue_door_3 room_2 room_4`
2. `toggle blue_door_3`
3. `gotoroom room_2 room_4 blue_door_3`
4. `gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4`
5. `pick purple_ball_1 room_4` - holding an object (constraint 1)
6. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3`
7. `toggle green_door_1`
8. `gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1` - purple_ball_1 is in room_3 (constraint 5)
9. `gotoempty`
10. `drop purple_ball_1 room_3`
11. `gotodoor blue_door_2 room_3 room_1`
12. `toggle blue_door_2`
13. `gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_2` - in room_1 (constraint 4)
14. `gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2`
15. `toggle blue_door_1`
16. `gotoroom room_1 room_2 blue_door_1`
17. `gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2`
18. `pick yellow_ball_1 room_2` - holding an object
19. `gotodoor blue_door_3 room_2 room_4` - in front of blue_door_3 (constraint 2)
20. `gotoroom room_2 room_4 blue_door_3`
21. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3`
22. `gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1` - both in room_3 and yellow_ball_1 in room_3 (constraint 3)
23. `gotoempty`
24. `drop yellow_ball_1 room_3`
25. `gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_3` - goal achieved (in front of a yellow ball)

Note: The goal is to be in front of a yellow ball. Since yellow_ball_2 is already in room_3, we could shorten the plan by ending it at step 12 and then directly going to yellow_ball_2. But to satisfy constraint 3, I need to have yellow_ball_1 in room_3 at some point.

Actually, this isn't right. Step 8 only has "I'm in room_3" and "I'm carrying purple_ball_1" but it doesn't have "purple_ball_1 is in room_3". So I need to verify when constraint 5 is actually satisfied. It should be satisfied after I drop the ball in step 10. So I need to ensure the constraint check is after the "drop" action.

Same for constraint 3. After step 22, I'm in room_3 with yellow_ball_1, but it's not yet "in" room_3. It's not until after step 24 that yellow_ball_1 is in room_3.

So let's fix our constraint checks:

1. `gotodoor blue_door_3 room_2 room_4`
2. `toggle blue_door_3`
3. `gotoroom room_2 room_4 blue_door_3`
4. `gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4`
5. `pick purple_ball_1 room_4` - holding an object (constraint 1)
6. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3`
7. `toggle green_door_1`
8. `gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1`
9. `gotoempty`
10. `drop purple_ball_1 room_3` - purple_ball_1 is in room_3 (constraint 5)
11. `gotodoor blue_door_2 room_3 room_1`
12. `toggle blue_door_2`
13. `gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_2` - in room_1 (constraint 4)
14. `gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2`
15. `toggle blue_door_1`
16. `gotoroom room_1 room_2 blue_door_1`
17. `gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2`
18. `pick yellow_ball_1 room_2`
19. `gotodoor blue_door_3 room_2 room_4` - in front of blue_door_3 (constraint 2)
20. `gotoroom room_2 room_4 blue_door_3`
21. `gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_3`
22. `gotoroom room_4 room_3 green_door_1`
23. `gotoempty`
24. `drop yellow_ball_1 room_3` - both in room_3 and yellow_ball_1 in room_3 (constraint 3)
25. `gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_3` - goal achieved (in front of a yellow ball)
