Okay, let's see. I need to find a plan that gets me in front of a yellow ball. The initial state says I'm in room_2, and there's a yellow_ball_1 there. Wait, the goal is to have a yellow ball that I'm in front of. So maybe I can just go to that ball in room_2?

But wait, the initial state says all doors are locked. So if I need to go to another room, I have to unlock doors first. But in this case, maybe I don't need to. Let me check the objects in room_2. The initial state lists yellow_ball_1 in room_2. So if I can go to that ball, then pick it up? No, the goal is just to be in front of it. Wait, the goal is "There is a ball v such that v is yellow and you are in front of v." So maybe I just need to be in front of any yellow ball. Since yellow_ball_1 is in room_2 where I start, perhaps I can just use the "gotoobject" action on it.

But wait, the preconditions for "gotoobject x r" require that I'm in the same room as x. Since I'm already in room_2 and the ball is there, that should be possible. So the plan could be as simple as "gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2".

But wait, are there any constraints? The problem mentions constraints that the plan must abide by. Let me check. The user provided the problem with constraints, but in the given input, under "A valid plan for the abovementioned problem must abide by the following constraints:", there's nothing listed. Hmm, maybe that's a formatting error. Or perhaps the constraints are part of the problem but not shown here. Wait, looking back, the original problem statement says "Provided a planning problem, consisting of an initial state of the world, a final goal and a set of constraints..." but the user input here doesn't list any constraints. Maybe that's a mistake. Or perhaps the constraints are implied in the problem's setup, like the doors being locked.

Wait, in the initial state, all doors are locked. So to move between rooms, I need to unlock them. But if the yellow_ball_1 is already in room_2 where I am, maybe I don't need to move rooms. So the steps would be:

1. Check if I can go directly to the yellow_ball_1 in room_2.

The "gotoobject" action's preconditions: I need to be in the same room as x. Yes, since I'm in room_2 and the ball is there. Also, when I perform "gotoobject", I will be in front of it. Then, that would satisfy the goal.

But wait, the initial state might have the agent not in front of any object. So the initial position is just in room_2, not in front of anything. So the action "gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2" would make me in front of it. Then the goal is achieved. But maybe there's an issue with doors being blocked.

Wait, the "goto door" action's preconditions mention that you can only go to a door if there's no object blocking the position in front of the door in your current room. But in this case, if I'm in room_2 and want to go to the ball, there's no door involved. So maybe the initial plan is just to use "gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2".

But wait, are there any objects blocking the path? The problem doesn't mention any such details about objects blocking positions unless they are in front of doors. The initial state says that objects can block doors. For example, if a box is in front of a door, then you can't go to that door. But in room_2, the objects present are yellow_ball_1, grey_box_1, yellow_box_1, grey_box_2. Are any of these blocking doors?

The doors connected to room_2 are blue_door_1 (connects to room_1) and blue_door_3 (connects to room_4). So if any objects are blocking those doors, then trying to go to them would be blocked. But since the problem doesn't specify positions of objects relative to doors, maybe we can assume that unless stated otherwise, objects are not blocking doors. Therefore, the initial plan to go to the yellow ball in room_2 is feasible.

So the plan would be:

gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2

But let's check the effects. After this action, the agent is in front of the yellow_ball_1, which satisfies the goal. Since the goal is simply to be in front of a yellow ball, and yellow_ball_1 is yellow and in room_2, this action alone should suffice.

But wait, are there any constraints that the user hasn't mentioned? The original problem statement mentioned constraints, but in the given input, there are none listed. So perhaps this is the optimal plan.

But maybe there's a catch. For example, perhaps the doors are locked, but since we don't need to move through any doors, it's irrelevant. The initial position is room_2, and the ball is in room_2. Therefore, the optimal plan is just one action: gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2.

So the answer would be:

```
gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2
```

But let me double-check the preconditions for "gotoobject". The agent must be in the same room as the object. Yes, the agent starts in room_2, and the ball is in room_2. The action's effect will put the agent in front of the ball. Therefore, this should work.

Is there any reason this wouldn't be possible? For example, if the agent is already in front of an object, but according to the initial state, the agent is not holding any object and there's no mention of being in front of any object. So the initial state is just being in room_2, not in front of anything. Therefore, executing "gotoobject" is valid.

Thus, the optimal plan is a single action.
