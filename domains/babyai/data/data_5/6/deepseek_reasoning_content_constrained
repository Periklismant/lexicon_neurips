Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. Hmm, the goal is to have a grey door that's unlocked, and I need to be in front of it. Also, there are several constraints to satisfy. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the initial state: I'm in room_4, and all doors are locked. The doors are grey_door_1 (connects room_1 and room_2), grey_door_2 (connects room_1 and room_3), green_door_1 (connects room_2 and room_4), and red_door_1 (connects room_3 and room_4). All doors are locked initially. The objects are spread across the rooms. So, I need to unlock a grey door. The grey doors are grey_door_1 and grey_door_2. So, the final goal is to be in front of either of these, unlocked.

But the constraints complicate things. Let's list them out:

1. Must be in room_4 at least once. Since we start there, that's already satisfied. But need to make sure that the constraints related to this are met.

2. If in room_4 in some state, then either in that state or a later one, I must be holding something and be in room_1. So, after being in room_4 (maybe even the initial state), I need to eventually get to room_1 while holding an object.

3. green_door_1 must be unlocked at some point. Then, when it's unlocked, either then or later, I must be holding yellow_box_1 and red_door_1 is unlocked.

4. Must be in front of green_door_1 at some state, and before that, must have held green_box_2 or red_box_1.

5. Must be in room_2 at some point. Before that, must have held grey_ball_1 and some object (so both at the same time? Wait, the constraint says "you are holding grey_ball_1" and "you are holding some object". But you can only hold one object at a time. Wait, that's impossible. Wait, maybe it's a typo? Or perhaps it's a logical AND, which would be impossible because you can't hold two objects. Hmm, this might be a problem. Wait, the original constraint says: "The following conditions are all true: 'you are holding grey_ball_1', 'you are holding some object'". But since holding two objects isn't possible, maybe this is a mistake. Alternatively, maybe "you are holding some object" is redundant if you're already holding grey_ball_1. Or perhaps it's a misinterpretation. Maybe the constraint is that in the earlier state, you were holding grey_ball_1 and also holding any object (which would require having two objects, which is impossible). That seems contradictory. Maybe there's an error here, but perhaps the intended meaning is that you were holding grey_ball_1 at some point before entering room_2. Or maybe the 'some object' includes grey_ball_1. Wait, the phrasing is "you are holding grey_ball_1", "you are holding some object". Since grey_ball_1 is an object, the second condition is redundant. So maybe the constraint is just that you were holding grey_ball_1 before entering room_2. That makes more sense. Maybe it's a way to say that you have to have held grey_ball_1 before entering room_2. Let's proceed under that assumption, but keep this in mind in case the plan fails.

6. Must be in front of grey_door_1 at some point. Before that, yellow_box_1 was in room_3. Initially, yellow_box_1 is in room_4, so this requires moving it to room_3. But yellow_box_1 is in room_4 initially, so we need to pick it up, take it to room_3, and drop it there.

So, putting this all together:

First, the goal is to unlock a grey door and be in front of it. Let's choose grey_door_1 (between room_1 and room_2) or grey_door_2 (between room_1 and room_3). Let's see which path is easier given constraints.

But let's look at the constraints. For example, constraint 4: when you are in front of green_door_1, you must have previously held green_box_2 or red_box_1. green_box_2 is in room_3, red_box_1 is in room_2. So to get green_box_2, I need to go to room_3, pick it up. But to get to room_3 from room_4, the door is red_door_1, which is locked. So first, I need to unlock red_door_1. But to toggle a door, I need to be in front of it, which requires being in one of the connected rooms. So red_door_1 connects room_3 and room_4. So if I'm in room_4, I can go to red_door_1, toggle it to unlock. But initially, it's locked. So steps:

From room_4, gotoempty (since no objects are in front). Then, gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_3. But to do that, I need to check if the position in front of the door in room_4 is blocked. The preconditions for gotodoor: you can only go in front of door d if (i) you are in a room connected by d, and (ii) no object is blocking the position in front of d in your current room. In room_4, the doors are green_door_1 (connected to room_2) and red_door_1 (connected to room_3). Are there any objects blocking the doors? The initial state lists objects in each room. In room_4, yellow_box_1 is present. But where is it located? The problem doesn't specify exact positions, but perhaps the presence in the room doesn't block the door unless explicitly stated. The problem says "if x was blocking some door" in the pick effect. So maybe objects only block doors if they are in front of them. So when you drop an object in a room, it's in front of you. So if you drop an object in front of a door, it blocks it. So in the initial state, the doors might not be blocked because the objects are in their respective rooms but not in front of the doors. So assuming that, in room_4, yellow_box_1 is not blocking red_door_1. So we can go to red_door_1 from room_4.

So steps:

1. In room_4, go to red_door_1 (gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_3).

But wait, the gotodoor action is "gotodoor d r1 r2" where d connects r1 and r2. So to go to red_door_1 from room_4, which connects room_4 to room_3. So the action would be gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_3. Then, since the door is locked, we can't go through yet, but we can toggle it. So after gotodoor, perform toggle red_door_1 to unlock it.

Then, gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_1 to go to room_3.

In room_3, there's blue_box_1, grey_box_1, green_box_2. To get green_box_2, we need to gotoobject green_box_2 room_3, then pick it up. But need to make sure that when we drop it somewhere, it's not blocking a door. But maybe we need to carry it to unlock a door.

But constraint 4 says that when we are in front of green_door_1 (which connects room_2 and room_4), we must have previously held green_box_2 or red_box_1. So perhaps we need to carry green_box_2 through green_door_1. But green_door_1 is initially locked. So to unlock it, we need to be in front of it and toggle it. green_door_1 is in room_2 and room_4. So if we are in room_4, we can go to green_door_1, toggle it. But to do that, we need to be in room_4. Let's see.

But let's outline the steps needed:

To satisfy the goal, we need to have a grey door unlocked and be in front of it. Let's pick grey_door_1 (room_1 and room_2). To unlock it, we need to be in front of it and toggle it. So to get to grey_door_1, we need to be in either room_1 or room_2. Let's see how to get there.

Starting in room_4. To get to room_2, we can go through green_door_1, but it's locked. So we need to unlock green_door_1. To do that, we need to be in front of it. So from room_4, gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2. Then toggle it. But constraint 4 says that before being in front of green_door_1, we must have held green_box_2 or red_box_1. So we need to have picked up either of those before going to green_door_1.

But green_box_2 is in room_3. So perhaps the path is:

1. Unlock red_door_1 (room_4 to room_3) to get to room_3.

From room_4:

- gotoempty (to be in front of empty spot)
- gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_3 (now in front of red_door_1)
- toggle red_door_1 (unlock it)
- gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_1 (now in room_3)
- gotoobject green_box_2 room_3
- pick green_box_2 room_3 (now holding it)
- Now, need to take it back to room_4 to use it for unlocking green_door_1.

But to go back to room_4, use red_door_1 again. But we already unlocked it. So:

- gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_4
- toggle red_door_1? Wait, no, we need to go through. Wait, gotoroom is from current room to another. So from room_3, gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_1. But since the door is unlocked, that's possible.

But after picking green_box_2, we need to go back to room_4. So:

After picking green_box_2:

- gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_4 (assuming door is unlocked)
- gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_1 (now in room_4, holding green_box_2)
- Now, go to green_door_1 (in room_4) to unlock it.

But to do that:

- gotoempty (if needed)
- gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2 (now in front of green_door_1)
- toggle green_door_1 (unlock it)
- Now, green_door_1 is unlocked. According to constraint 3, when green_door_1 is unlocked, then in the same or later state, I must be holding yellow_box_1 and red_door_1 is unlocked. Wait, red_door_1 was unlocked earlier, so that's okay. But I need to be holding yellow_box_1. So after unlocking green_door_1, I need to pick up yellow_box_1, which is in room_4. But I'm currently holding green_box_2. So I need to drop it first.

So:

After unlocking green_door_1:

- drop green_box_2 room_4 (now in front of it)
- gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_4
- pick yellow_box_1 room_4 (now holding it)
- Now, the constraint is satisfied: when green_door_1 was unlocked, later I'm holding yellow_box_1 and red_door_1 is unlocked (which it is).

Then, to go to room_2 via green_door_1:

- gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2 (in front of it)
- gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_1 (now in room_2)

But in room_2, there's red_box_1 and grey_ball_2. Also, the constraint 5 says that when in room_2, I must have held grey_ball_1 before. But grey_ball_1 is in room_1. So how do I get there? To get to room_1, we need to go through grey_door_1 (room_1 and room_2) but it's locked. So need to unlock grey_door_1.

But to unlock grey_door_1, I need to be in front of it. So from room_2, gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_1. Then toggle it. But before that, according to constraint 6: when I'm in front of grey_door_1, I must have had yellow_box_1 in room_3. Wait, no: the constraint says that if I'm in front of grey_door_1, there must be an earlier state where yellow_box_1 was in room_3. Originally, yellow_box_1 is in room_4. So I need to move it to room_3. But in the current plan, I picked up yellow_box_1 in room_4 and am holding it. So perhaps I need to drop it in room_3. Wait, but how? Let's backtrack.

Wait, the constraint for being in front of grey_door_1 requires that in an earlier state, yellow_box_1 was in room_3. So I need to have moved yellow_box_1 from room_4 to room_3 at some point. But in the current plan, after unlocking green_door_1 and picking up yellow_box_1, I could go to room_3 via red_door_1 (already unlocked), drop it there, then proceed.

Let's adjust:

After picking up yellow_box_1 in room_4:

- gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_3
- gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_1 (now in room_3)
- drop yellow_box_1 room_3 (now it's in room_3)
- Now, the constraint for grey_door_1 is satisfied if we later go in front of it. Then, we can proceed to go back to room_4, then to room_2, etc.

But this seems like a lot of steps. Let's see.

Alternatively, maybe there's a more optimal path. Let's think.

The main goal is to be in front of an unlocked grey door. Let's consider grey_door_2 (connects room_1 and room_3). If we can unlock that door, then we can be in front of it. But how to get there.

Alternatively, perhaps using grey_door_1 (room_1 and room_2). Let's see.

But regardless, let's try to outline the steps considering all constraints.

Another constraint is that when in room_4, at some point after, we must be in room_1 holding an object. So after starting in room_4, we need to eventually get to room_1 while holding something.

Let's try to map out a possible path:

1. Unlock red_door_1 to access room_3.
2. Pick green_box_2 in room_3 and bring it to room_4.
3. Use green_box_2 to satisfy constraint 4 when unlocking green_door_1.
4. Unlock green_door_1, then pick yellow_box_1 and move it to room_3.
5. Then go to room_2 via green_door_1.
6. From room_2, unlock grey_door_1 to reach room_1.
7. In room_1, pick grey_ball_1, then go to room_2, which satisfies the constraint that before entering room_2, you held grey_ball_1.
8. Then unlock grey_door_1, and be in front of it (grey and unlocked), achieving the goal.

But let's step through this:

Initial state: room_4, holding nothing, all doors locked.

Step 1: gotoempty in room_4 (to be in front of empty spot)
Step 2: gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_3 (now in front of red_door_1)
Step 3: toggle red_door_1 (unlock it)
Step 4: gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_1 (now in room_3)
Step 5: gotoobject green_box_2 room_3
Step 6: pick green_box_2 room_3 (now holding it)
Step 7: gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_4
Step 8: gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_1 (back to room_4)
Step 9: drop green_box_2 room_4 (to free hands)
Step 10: gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_4
Step 11: pick yellow_box_1 room_4 (now holding it)
Step 12: gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_3
Step 13: gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_1 (to room_3)
Step 14: drop yellow_box_1 room_3 (now yellow_box_1 is in room_3, satisfying constraint 6)
Step 15: gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_4
Step 16: gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_1 (back to room_4)
Step 17: gotoempty (maybe not needed)
Step 18: gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2 (now in front of green_door_1)
- At this point, constraint 4 requires that before being in front of green_door_1, we held green_box_2 or red_box_1. We did hold green_box_2 earlier, so that's satisfied.
Step 19: toggle green_door_1 (unlock it)
- Now, green_door_1 is unlocked. According to constraint 3, after this, we need to be holding yellow_box_1 and red_door_1 is unlocked. But red_door_1 is already unlocked, and we need to hold yellow_box_1. However, we just dropped yellow_box_1 in room_3. So we have to pick it up again. Wait, this is a problem. So after unlocking green_door_1, we need to have yellow_box_1 in hand. But we dropped it in room_3. So we need to go back to room_3, pick it up, and bring it back.

Alternatively, perhaps we can adjust the steps to hold yellow_box_1 when unlocking green_door_1. Let's see:

After step 11 (holding yellow_box_1 in room_4), instead of going to room_3, go to green_door_1.

So modify steps:

Step 12: gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2 (in front of it)
- Now, before this, we held green_box_2 (step 6), so constraint 4 is satisfied.
Step 13: toggle green_door_1 (unlock it)
- Now, green_door_1 is unlocked. At this state, we are holding yellow_box_1 and red_door_1 is unlocked (from step 3). So constraint 3 is satisfied.
Step 14: gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_1 (now in room_2)
- Now, in room_2. According to constraint 5, before entering room_2, we must have held grey_ball_1. But we haven't done that yet. So this is a problem. So this path doesn't satisfy the constraint.

So we need to make sure that before entering room_2, we have held grey_ball_1. Since grey_ball_1 is in room_1, we need to get to room_1 first. But room_1 is connected to room_2 via grey_door_1 (locked) and to room_3 via grey_door_2 (locked). So how to get to room_1?

To get to room_1, we need to unlock either grey_door_1 or grey_door_2. Let's try unlocking grey_door_2, which connects room_1 and room_3. To do that, we need to be in room_3 or room_1. Currently, after step 14, we are in room_2, but let's see.

Alternatively, after unlocking green_door_1, go to room_2, but then we need to go back to room_4, then to room_3, then to room_1 via grey_door_2.

But this is getting complicated. Let's try another approach.

Alternative plan:

1. Unlock red_door_1 to access room_3.
2. In room_3, pick green_box_2, take it to room_4.
3. Unlock green_door_1 in room_4 (needs green_box_2 or red_box_1 held before). So after step 2, we have green_box_2, so satisfy that.
4. Unlock green_door_1, then go to room_2.
5. In room_2, pick red_box_1 (if needed), then go to room_1 via grey_door_1 (but it's locked). So need to unlock grey_door_1.
6. To unlock grey_door_1, go to it from room_2, toggle it. But before that, yellow_box_1 must be in room_3. So need to move yellow_box_1 from room_4 to room_3.

So steps:

1. Unlock red_door_1 (steps as before).
2. Pick green_box_2 in room_3, bring to room_4.
3. Unlock green_door_1 (using green_box_2's previous hold).
4. Go to room_2 via green_door_1.
5. Now, need to get to room_1 via grey_door_1. But it's locked. So need to unlock it.
6. To unlock grey_door_1, be in front of it from room_2. So gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_1.
7. Toggle grey_door_1 (unlock it).
8. Now, can go to room_1. But before entering room_2, we need to have held grey_ball_1. But grey_ball_1 is in room_1. So how can we hold it before entering room_2? That's impossible unless we go to room_1 before entering room_2. Which we can't do unless we have a path. Hmm, this seems conflicting. So maybe the only way is to first go to room_1, pick grey_ball_1, then go to room_2. But how?

Wait, the initial position is room_4. To get to room_1, possible paths:

From room_4, go to room_3 via red_door_1 (unlocked), then from room_3 to room_1 via grey_door_2 (locked). So need to unlock grey_door_2. To unlock grey_door_2, need to be in front of it from room_3 or room_1. But room_1 is inaccessible. So perhaps:

After unlocking red_door_1 and green_door_1:

- Go to room_2 via green_door_1.
- Then, in room_2, pick red_box_1 (if possible), but need to be in front of it.
- Then, go to room_4, then to room_3, then unlock grey_door_2 from room_3, then go to room_1.

But this is getting very long. Let's see if there's a better way.

Alternatively, after unlocking red_door_1 and green_door_1, go to room_3, unlock grey_door_2, then go to room_1.

Steps:

After step 3 (unlock green_door_1):

- Go to room_2 via green_door_1 (constraint 5: must have held grey_ball_1 before. But grey_ball_1 is in room_1. So this approach won't work unless we have a way to get to room_1 first.

This is getting too tangled. Let's try to outline all constraints and see what's needed.

Constraints:

- Must be in room_4 at least once (already satisfied).
- If in room_4, then eventually be in room_1 holding something.
- green_door_1 must be unlocked, and when it is, hold yellow_box_1 and red_door_1 is unlocked.
- When in front of green_door_1, must have held green_box_2 or red_box_1 before.
- Must be in room_2, and before that, held grey_ball_1.
- Must be in front of grey_door_1, and before that, yellow_box_1 was in room_3.

So, the plan must include:

1. Moving yellow_box_1 to room_3.
2. Unlocking green_door_1 after holding green_box_2.
3. Unlocking red_door_1.
4. Going to room_1 to pick grey_ball_1 before going to room_2.
5. Being in front of grey_door_1 (unlocked) to satisfy the goal.

So perhaps the optimal path is:

- Start in room_4.
- Unlock red_door_1, go to room_3.
- Pick green_box_2, take it to room_4.
- Unlock green_door_1 (now in room_4, holding green_box_2 is not needed anymore? Wait, need to satisfy that when unlocking green_door_1, I have held green_box_2 before. So as long as I held it before, it's okay. So after dropping green_box_2 in room_4, then unlock green_door_1.

But then, after unlocking green_door_1, need to hold yellow_box_1 and have red_door_1 unlocked. So after unlocking green_door_1, pick yellow_box_1 (in room_4), then take it to room_3 and drop it.

Then, go to room_2 via green_door_1. But before entering room_2, need to have held grey_ball_1. So how?

Perhaps:

After moving yellow_box_1 to room_3, go to room_3, unlock grey_door_2 (connecting to room_1). Then go to room_1, pick grey_ball_1, drop it, then go to room_2 via grey_door_1 (unlocking it).

But this requires several steps.

Let's try:

1. Initial: room_4.
2. Unlock red_door_1.
3. Go to room_3, pick green_box_2.
4. Return to room_4, drop green_box_2.
5. Unlock green_door_1.
6. Pick yellow_box_1 in room_4.
7. Go to room_3, drop yellow_box_1 (now satisfies constraint 6 when later in front of grey_door_1).
8. Go back to room_4.
9. Go to room_2 via green_door_1.
   - But before entering room_2, need to have held grey_ball_1. Which is in room_1. So need to get to room_1 first.
10. So from room_4, can I get to room_1? Only via room_3 and grey_door_2. So unlock grey_door_2:
    - Go to room_3 via red_door_1.
    - Unlock grey_door_2.
    - Go to room_1 via grey_door_2.
    - Pick grey_ball_1.
    - Drop it (to carry something else? Or just hold it).
11. Now, go back to room_3, then to room_4, then to room_2 via green_door_1.
    - Now, entering room_2, which requires having held grey_ball_1 before, which we did.
12. In room_2, unlock grey_door_1 (since it's grey and needs to be unlocked for the goal).
    - Go to grey_door_1 in room_2.
    - Toggle to unlock.
    - Now, be in front of grey_door_1, which is grey and unlocked. This satisfies the goal.

Let's check if all constraints are met:

- Must be in room_4: yes, multiple times.
- If in room_4, then in room_1 holding something: When did we go to room_1? Step 10: went to room_1 via grey_door_2 from room_3, picked grey_ball_1 (holding it), then maybe dropped it later. So after being in room_4, we eventually went to room_1 and held grey_ball_1. So constraint 2 is satisfied.
- green_door_1 must be unlocked: yes, step 5.
- When green_door_1 is unlocked, must later hold yellow_box_1 and red_door_1 is unlocked: red_door_1 is unlocked, and after step 5, we picked yellow_box_1 in step 6. So yes.
- When in front of green_door_1 (step 5), had held green_box_2 earlier (step 3). So yes.
- Must be in room_2: yes, step 11.
- Before being in room_2, held grey_ball_1 (step 10). Yes.
- Must be in front of grey_door_1 (step 12), and before that, yellow_box_1 was in room_3 (step 7). Yes.

So this plan satisfies all constraints and the goal.

Now, let's write the step-by-step actions:

1. gotoempty (room_4)
2. gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_3
3. toggle red_door_1
4. gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_1
5. gotoobject green_box_2 room_3
6. pick green_box_2 room_3
7. gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_4
8. gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_1
9. drop green_box_2 room_4
10. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2
11. toggle green_door_1
12. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_4
13. pick yellow_box_1 room_4
14. gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_3
15. gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_1
16. drop yellow_box_1 room_3
17. gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_4
18. gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_1
19. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2
20. gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_1
21. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_1
22. toggle grey_door_1
23. (now in front of grey_door_1, which is unlocked and grey)

Wait, step 22 would toggle grey_door_1 from locked to unlocked. Then, being in front of it satisfies the goal. But after step 22, the agent is still in room_2, in front of grey_door_1. So this action sequence would end here.

But wait, after step 20, the agent is in room_2. Then, step 21: gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_1 (now in front of grey_door_1 in room_2). Step 22: toggle it (unlock). Now, the agent is in front of grey_door_1, which is grey and unlocked. This meets the goal.

But also, need to check if all constraints are met:

- When entering room_2 (step 20), before that, the agent was in room_4. The constraint says that when in room_2, there must have been a prior state where the agent held grey_ball_1. But in this plan, the agent hasn't picked grey_ball_1 yet. So this is a problem. Oh no! We missed that step.

Ah, right. The agent needs to have held grey_ball_1 before entering room_2. So in this current plan, after step 18, the agent is back in room_4. Then, step 19: gotodoor green_door_1, step 20: go to room_2. But before that, the agent hasn't picked grey_ball_1. So this violates constraint 5.

So the plan is invalid. Need to adjust.

So after step 18 (back in room_4), before going to room_2, the agent must first go to room_1 and pick grey_ball_1. But how?

To get to room_1, from room_4, the path is room_4 -> room_3 via red_door_1, then room_3 -> room_1 via grey_door_2. But grey_door_2 is locked initially. So need to unlock it.

So inserting steps after step 18:

18.5: gotoempty (room_4)
18.6: gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_3
18.7: gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_1 (now in room_3)
18.8: gotodoor grey_door_2 room_3 room_1
18.9: toggle grey_door_2 (unlock it)
18.10: gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_2 (now in room_1)
18.11: gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_1
18.12: pick grey_ball_1 room_1 (now holding it)
18.13: drop grey_ball_1 room_1 (or keep holding)
18.14: gotodoor grey_door_2 room_1 room_3
18.15: gotoroom room_1 room_3 grey_door_2 (back to room_3)
18.16: gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_4
18.17: gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_1 (back to room_4)
Then proceed to step 19.

Now, when entering room_2 (step 20), the agent had previously held grey_ball_1 (step 18.12). So constraint 5 is satisfied.

But this adds many steps. Let's see if this makes the plan valid.

Revised steps:

1. gotoempty
2. gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_3
3. toggle red_door_1
4. gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_1
5. gotoobject green_box_2 room_3
6. pick green_box_2 room_3
7. gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_4
8. gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_1
9. drop green_box_2 room_4
10. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2
11. toggle green_door_1
12. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_4
13. pick yellow_box_1 room_4
14. gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_3
15. gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_1
16. drop yellow_box_1 room_3
17. gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_4
18. gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_1
19. gotoempty
20. gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_3
21. gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_1
22. gotodoor grey_door_2 room_3 room_1
23. toggle grey_door_2
24. gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_2
25. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_1
26. pick grey_ball_1 room_1
27. drop grey_ball_1 room_1
28. gotodoor grey_door_2 room_1 room_3
29. gotoroom room_1 room_3 grey_door_2
30. gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_4
31. gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_1
32. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2
33. gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_1
34. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_1
35. toggle grey_door_1

Now, this satisfies all constraints:

- At step 33, entering room_2. Before that, steps 26-27: held grey_ball_1.
- At step 35, in front of grey_door_1, which is now unlocked and grey. Also, yellow_box_1 was in room_3 at step 16.
- green_door_1 was toggled at step 11, and after that, yellow_box_1 was picked (step 13), and red_door_1 is unlocked (step3).
- When in front of green_door_1 (step10), had held green_box_2 (step6).
- The agent was in room_1 (steps24-29), which satisfies the constraint that after being in room_4 (step18.5-18.17), eventually in room_1 holding something (step26).

This seems to cover all constraints. However, this plan is quite long. Let's see if there's a shorter path.

Alternative approach:

Instead of moving yellow_box_1 to room_3, can we use another door? But the constraint requires that when in front of grey_door_1, yellow_box_1 was in room_3. So we must move it there.

Another optimization: after step 18, instead of going back to room_3 to unlock grey_door_2, maybe use the grey_door_1 from room_2. But initially, it's locked.

Alternatively, after unlocking grey_door_2 from room_3, go to room_1, pick grey_ball_1, then go back to room_3, then to room_4, then to room_2 via green_door_1. Then unlock grey_door_1.

But this still requires many steps.

Given the complexity, perhaps the optimal plan is as above. But let's count the steps. The initial plan was 35 actions. Is there a way to shorten it?

Wait, after step 13 (holding yellow_box_1), instead of going to room_3 to drop it, maybe we can go to room_2 via green_door_1, then to room_4 again, but this doesn't help.

Alternatively, after step 16 (yellow_box_1 in room_3), instead of going back to room_4, go to room_3 and unlock grey_door_2, then go to room_1.

Let's try:

After step 16 (yellow_box_1 in room_3):

17. gotodoor grey_door_2 room_3 room_1
18. toggle grey_door_2 (unlock)
19. gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_2
20. pick grey_ball_1 room_1
21. drop grey_ball_1 room_1 (optional)
22. gotodoor grey_door_2 room_1 room_3
23. gotoroom room_1 room_3 grey_door_2
24. gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_4
25. gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_1
26. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2
27. gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_1
28. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_1
29. toggle grey_door_1

This would be steps 1-16, then 17-29. Total steps: 29. Maybe this is shorter.

But let's check the steps:

Original steps up to 16: yellow_box_1 is in room_3. Then:

17. gotodoor grey_door_2 room_3 room_1 (from room_3)
18. toggle grey_door_2 (unlock)
19. gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_2 (now in room_1)
20. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_1
21. pick grey_ball_1 room_1
22. drop grey_ball_1 room_1 (optional, but need to hold it to satisfy constraint 5)
23. gotodoor grey_door_2 room_1 room_3
24. gotoroom room_1 room_3 grey_door_2 (back to room_3)
25. gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_4
26. gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_1 (back to room_4)
27. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2
28. toggle green_door_1 (unlock)
29. gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_1 (now in room_2)
30. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_1
31. toggle grey_door_1 (unlock)
32. (now in front of grey_door_1, unlocked)

But this sequence misses some steps, like picking yellow_box_1 after unlocking green_door_1. Let's see:

In the above steps, after step 16 (drop yellow_box_1 in room_3), the agent is in room_3. Then steps 17-24: go to room_1, pick grey_ball_1, drop it, return to room_3, then to room_4. Then steps 27: gotodoor green_door_1, but it's locked. So need to unlock it. But in step 28, toggle green_door_1. But before that, in step 27, the agent must be in front of green_door_1. So steps:

After step 26: back in room_4.

27. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2
28. toggle green_door_1 (unlock)
29. gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_1 (now in room_2)
30. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_1
31. toggle grey_door_1 (unlock)

But wait, when unlocking green_door_1 (step 28), the agent must have held green_box_2 or red_box_1 before. In this plan, the agent held green_box_2 in step6, then dropped it in step9. So that's okay.

Then, after step28, green_door_1 is unlocked. The constraint requires that after this, the agent must be holding yellow_box_1 and red_door_1 is unlocked. red_door_1 is unlocked (step3), but the agent is not holding yellow_box_1. So this violates constraint3.

Ah, right. So after unlocking green_door_1 (step28), the agent needs to hold yellow_box_1 at some point after. But in this plan, yellow_box_1 is in room_3 (step16). So the agent must pick it up again.

So steps after 28:

29. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_4 (but it's in room_3)
Oops, no. yellow_box_1 was moved to room_3. So agent can't pick it up in room_4. So this approach is invalid.

Thus, the agent must hold yellow_box_1 after unlocking green_door_1, which requires having it in room_4. But in this plan, yellow_box_1 is in room_3. So this approach doesn't work.

Hence, the earlier plan where yellow_box_1 is picked up after unlocking green_door_1 and then moved to room_3 is necessary.

This indicates that the initial long plan is the only way to satisfy all constraints.

Given the complexity, the optimal plan is likely the one that carefully follows each constraint step-by-step.
