Okay, let's see. The goal is to get in front of a grey door that's unlocked. But all the doors are initially locked. So I need to unlock one of the grey doors and then be in front of it. Let's look at the doors: grey_door_1 connects room_1 and room_2, grey_door_2 connects room_1 and room_3. The other doors are green and red, which we don't care about since we need a grey door.

The agent starts in room_4. The problem is how to get to either grey_door_1 or grey_door_2. Let's check the connections. From room_4, the connected rooms are room_2 via green_door_1 and room_3 via red_door_1. Both are locked. So the first step is to unlock those doors to move towards the grey doors.

Wait, but the agent needs to toggle a door to unlock it. But to toggle a door, the agent must be in front of it. So first, the agent needs to go to a door that's locked, then toggle it. But the doors in room_4 are green_door_1 (connecting to room_2) and red_door_1 (connecting to room_3). Both are locked. So maybe the plan is to go to one of those doors, toggle them to unlock, then go through to another room, and proceed towards the grey doors.

But the problem is that all doors are locked initially. So starting in room_4, the agent can't move to other rooms unless they unlock the doors. So first, go to the door in room_4 leading to room_2 or room_3. Let's pick green_door_1 first. So:

1. Goto door green_door_1 in room_4 (since the agent is in room_4, which is connected to room_2 via green_door_1). But wait, the preconditions for "gotodoor" are that the agent is in a room connected by that door, and there's no object blocking the position in front of the door. Are there any objects blocking the doors in room_4? The initial state mentions objects in each room. In room_4, there's yellow_box_1. But the problem statement says that objects can be boxes or balls, and each has a color. However, the initial state doesn't mention any objects blocking doors. Wait, the effect of "drop" action says that if an object was blocking a door, then picking it up unblocks it. But in the initial state, are any doors blocked? The problem's original state doesn't state any doors are blocked. So assuming that the doors are not blocked by objects initially. So the agent can go to the door.

So step 1: "gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2" (but the syntax is "gotodoor d r1 r2"? Wait, the action is "gotodoor d r1 r2", where d is the door, and r1 is the current room. Wait, the action's format is "gotodoor d r1 r2", but the agent must be in a room that the door connects. So in room_4, the doors are green_door_1 (connecting to room_2) and red_door_1 (connecting to room_3). So to go to green_door_1 from room_4, the correct command would be "gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2".

After that, the agent can toggle the door, unlocking it. Then use "gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_1" to move to room_2. Once in room_2, the agent can proceed to grey_door_1, which connects room_1 and room_2. But grey_door_1 is in room_2 and room_1. So from room_2, the agent can go to grey_door_1 (assuming it's not blocked), toggle it to unlock, and then be in front of an unlocked grey door.

Wait, but the goal is to have a grey door that is unlocked and the agent is in front of it. So perhaps after unlocking grey_door_1, the agent is in front of it. Let's see the steps:

Start in room_4. Need to get to room_2 to access grey_door_1. But room_4 to room_2 is via green_door_1, which is locked. So first, go to green_door_1 in room_4, toggle it (unlock), then go through to room_2. Then in room_2, go to grey_door_1, toggle it (since it's locked initially), then be in front of it, which is now unlocked. That would satisfy the goal.

So the steps would be:

1. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2
2. toggle green_door_1 (unlocks it)
3. gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_1 (move to room_2)
4. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_1
5. toggle grey_door_1 (unlocks it)
6. Now, the agent is in front of grey_door_1, which is unlocked. So the goal is achieved.

Wait, but after step 3, the agent is in room_2. Then step 4: gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_1. Then step 5: toggle. Then after toggle, the door is unlocked. And the agent is in front of it. So yes, step 6 would be the state where the agent is in front of a grey door (grey_door_1) which is not locked. So the plan would be those steps. Let's check the preconditions at each step.

1. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2: Agent is in room_4, which is connected via green_door_1 to room_2. Precondition met. No blocking object. So possible.

2. toggle green_door_1: Agent is in front of green_door_1. After step 1, the agent is in front of green_door_1. So toggle is possible. This unlocks the door.

3. gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_1: Agent is in room_4, using door green_door_1 (now unlocked) to go to room_2. Precondition: door is unlocked. Yes. So this moves to room_2.

4. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_1: Agent is in room_2, which is connected to room_1 via grey_door_1. Check if any object is blocking the door. In room_2, the objects are red_box_1 and grey_ball_2. Unless they're blocking the door's position. But the initial state doesn't mention any door being blocked. So assuming they are not blocked. So this action is possible.

5. toggle grey_door_1: Now in front of grey_door_1. Toggle will unlock it. So now, the door is unlocked, and the agent is in front of it. So the goal is achieved.

Therefore, the plan would be:

goto door green_door_1 in room_4, toggle it, go to room_2, goto door grey_door_1 in room_2, toggle it. Then the agent is in front of grey_door_1 which is grey and unlocked. That meets the goal. The steps are 5 actions. Let me check if there's a shorter path.

Alternative: Starting in room_4, perhaps use red_door_1 to go to room_3. But red_door_1 is locked. So similar steps: goto red_door_1 in room_4, toggle (unlock), go to room_3. Then from room_3, go to grey_door_2 (connects to room_1), which is grey and locked. So toggle it. Then the agent is in front of grey_door_2, which is unlocked. That's also a valid solution. Which is shorter? Let's see:

Path via room_3:

1. gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_3

2. toggle red_door_1 (unlocks)

3. gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_1

4. gotodoor grey_door_2 room_3 room_1

5. toggle grey_door_2

Same number of steps. So either path works. Which one is possible?

But the initial state has the agent in room_4, and the doors are green_door_1 (room4-room2) and red_door_1 (room4-room3). So both options are possible. Now, the problem's constraints: Are there any constraints that would affect this choice? The problem's original state says that the doors are connected as:

room_2 and room_1 via grey_door_1 (both directions)

room_1 and room_3 via grey_door_2.

So both grey doors are in room_1 connected to room_2 and room_3, respectively. But in the initial state, the agent is in room_4. To reach either grey door, the agent needs to go through green or red doors first.

So the steps would be similar in either case. The plan length is 5 steps in either case. So both are optimal. So either plan is acceptable.

But let's check which doors are grey. The problem states that grey_door_1 and grey_door_2 are both grey. So both are candidates. So either is acceptable. So the plan can be either path. Let me pick the first one: green_door_1 route.

But wait, in the initial state, the doors grey_door_1 and grey_door_2 are both locked. So after unlocking green_door_1, moving to room_2, then moving to grey_door_1 and unlocking it. Then the agent is in front of grey_door_1, which is unlocked.

Alternatively, the other path would have the agent in front of grey_door_2 after unlocking it. Both satisfy the goal.

So the plan steps would be:

1. gotodoor green_door_1 room_4 room_2

2. toggle green_door_1

3. gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_1

4. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_1

5. toggle grey_door_1

That's 5 actions. Then the agent is in front of grey_door_1 (grey) which is unlocked. So the goal is achieved. Therefore, this is a valid plan.

Alternatively, if I choose the red_door_1 path:

1. gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_3

2. toggle red_door_1

3. gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_1

4. gotodoor grey_door_2 room_3 room_1

5. toggle grey_door_2

Also 5 steps. Both are valid. But the problem says the optimal plan must have a length equal or less than any other plan. So are there any shorter paths? Let me think. Is there a way to reach a grey door in fewer steps?

Suppose the agent is in room_4 and can go directly to a grey door without passing through other doors. But the grey doors are connected to room_1 and room_2 or room_1 and room_3. So room_4 is connected only to room_2 and room_3. So no direct path to a grey door from room_4. So the agent must go through at least two doors: first green or red, then grey.

But perhaps there's a way to unlock a grey door without toggling it? No, because all doors start locked, and the goal requires them to be unlocked. So the toggle is necessary.

Thus, the minimal steps are 5. Both paths are 5 steps, so either is optimal. The answer can be either. Let's proceed with one of them.
