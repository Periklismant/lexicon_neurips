Let me break down the problem:

I am an agent in a 2D gridworld with 4 rooms arranged in a square. The rooms have doors connecting them, and each room may contain boxes and balls of different colors.

I need to provide a sequence of actions to achieve a goal, given a set of constraints and an initial state.

### Initial State:
- I am in room_4.
- grey_ball_1 is in room_1.
- green_box_1 is in room_1.
- red_box_1 is in room_2.
- grey_ball_2 is in room_2.
- blue_box_1 is in room_3.
- grey_box_1 is in room_3.
- green_box_2 is in room_3.
- yellow_box_1 is in room_4.
- All doors are locked.
- I am not holding any object.

### Goal:
- Be in front of a grey door that is unlocked.

### Constraints:
1. I must be in room_4 at some point (already satisfied in the initial state).
2. If I'm in room_4, then I must hold an object and be in room_1 at a later state.
3. green_door_1 must be unlocked at some point.
4. If green_door_1 is unlocked, then I must hold yellow_box_1 and red_door_1 should be unlocked.
5. I must be in front of green_door_1 at some point.
6. If I'm in front of green_door_1, I must have held either green_box_2 or red_box_1 earlier.
7. I must be in room_2 at some point.
8. If I'm in room_2, I must have held grey_ball_1 and some object earlier.
9. I must be in front of grey_door_1 at some point.
10. If I'm in front of grey_door_1, yellow_box_1 must have been in room_3 at an earlier state.

Let's think about what doors would satisfy the goal. The goal is to be in front of a grey door that is unlocked. There are two grey doors: grey_door_1 (connecting room_1 and room_2) and grey_door_2 (connecting room_1 and room_3). So I need to unlock one of these doors and then go in front of it.

Now, I need to make sure I satisfy all the constraints while working towards the goal.

Starting from room_4, let me see if I can work backwards from the goal to the initial state:

1. I need to be in front of a grey door (grey_door_1 or grey_door_2) that is unlocked.
2. Constraint 9 says I must be in front of grey_door_1 at some point, so let's choose grey_door_1 for the goal.
3. According to constraint 10, if I'm in front of grey_door_1, yellow_box_1 must have been in room_3 at an earlier state. So I need to move yellow_box_1 from room_4 to room_3 at some point.
4. Constraint 7 says I must be in room_2 at some point.
5. According to constraint 8, if I'm in room_2, I must have held grey_ball_1 and some object earlier.
6. Constraint 5 says I must be in front of green_door_1 at some point.
7. According to constraint 6, if I'm in front of green_door_1, I must have held either green_box_2 or red_box_1 earlier.
8. Constraint 3 says green_door_1 must be unlocked at some point.
9. According to constraint 4, if green_door_1 is unlocked, I must hold yellow_box_1 and red_door_1 should be unlocked.
10. Constraint 2 says if I'm in room_4, I must hold an object and be in room_1 at a later state.

Let's plan step by step to satisfy these constraints:

1. I'm in room_4 initially, and yellow_box_1 is also in room_4.
2. I'll pick up yellow_box_1 (according to constraint 4, I need to hold yellow_box_1 when green_door_1 is unlocked).
3. I need to go to room_3 through red_door_1. So I'll first go to the red_door_1 and unlock it.
4. Then I'll go to room_3.
5. I'll drop yellow_box_1 in room_3 (to satisfy constraint 10, which says yellow_box_1 must have been in room_3).
6. I need to pick up green_box_2 in room_3 (to satisfy constraint 6).
7. I'll go to room_1 through grey_door_2, which means I need to go to grey_door_2 first and unlock it.
8. In room_1, I'll drop green_box_2 (I'm not sure if this is necessary, but let's do it to free my hands for the next step).
9. I'll pick up grey_ball_1 in room_1 (to satisfy constraint 8).
10. I'll go to room_2 through grey_door_1, which means I need to go to grey_door_1 first and unlock it.
11. In room_2, I can drop grey_ball_1 (again, not sure if necessary, but let's do it).
12. I'll pick up red_box_1 in room_2 (to both satisfy constraint 6 and get an object to hold for constraint 2).
13. I'll go to room_4 through green_door_1, which means I need to go to green_door_1 first and unlock it.
14. In room_4, I'll pick up yellow_box_1 again (to satisfy constraint 4).
15. I'll go to room_3 through red_door_1.
16. I'll drop yellow_box_1 (not necessary, but to free hands).
17. I'll go to room_1 through grey_door_2.
18. I'll drop red_box_1 (to satisfy constraint 2, which says I need to hold an object and be in room_1).
19. I'll go to grey_door_1 (connecting room_1 and room_2) to be in front of it, which completes the goal.

Wait, there's an issue with this plan. I need to reconsider. I'm getting confused about how to satisfy all constraints while working towards the goal. Let me rethink this more carefully:

First, let's assess the connectivity between the rooms:
- room_1 connects to room_2 via grey_door_1
- room_1 connects to room_3 via grey_door_2
- room_2 connects to room_4 via green_door_1
- room_3 connects to room_4 via red_door_1

Let's start by thinking about how to satisfy some of the constraints:

1. Constraint 2: If I'm in room_4, I must hold an object and be in room_1 at a later state.
   - I'm in room_4 initially, so I need to pick up an object and then go to room_1.
   - I can pick up yellow_box_1 in room_4.

2. Constraint 10: If I'm in front of grey_door_1, yellow_box_1 must have been in room_3 at an earlier state.
   - This means I need to move yellow_box_1 from room_4 to room_3 before I go in front of grey_door_1.

Given these, let's revise the plan:

1. I'm in room_4 initially.
2. I'll pick up yellow_box_1.
3. I need to go to room_3 through red_door_1, so I need to unlock red_door_1 first.
4. I'll go to room_3 and drop yellow_box_1 (this satisfies constraint 10).
5. I need to pick up green_box_2 in room_3 to satisfy constraint 6 (I need to have held green_box_2 or red_box_1 before being in front of green_door_1).
6. I'll go to room_1 through grey_door_2, which means I need to go to grey_door_2 first and unlock it.
7. In room_1, I'll drop green_box_2 to free my hands.
8. I'll pick up grey_ball_1 in room_1 (to satisfy constraint 8).
9. I'll go to room_2 through grey_door_1, which means I need to go to grey_door_1 first and unlock it.
10. In room_2, I'll drop grey_ball_1 (satisfying constraint 7 and partially constraint 8).
11. I'll pick up red_box_1 in room_2 (to get an object to hold and to prepare for constraint 6).
12. I need to go back to room_4 through green_door_1, but before that, I need to unlock it.
13. I'll go to green_door_1 and try to unlock it.

Hmm, but constraint 4 says if green_door_1 is unlocked, I must hold yellow_box_1 and red_door_1 should be unlocked. But I can't hold both yellow_box_1 and red_box_1 at the same time. Let me revisit the constraints and see if I'm interpreting them correctly.

Ok, I've re-read the constraint 4, and it is:
"If green_door_1 is not locked, then expression 'The following conditions are all true: "you are holding yellow_box_1", "red_door_1 is not locked"' must hold at s or at some state after s"

So when green_door_1 is unlocked, I need to ensure that at that state or later, I'm holding yellow_box_1 and red_door_1 is unlocked.

Let's re-plan:

1. I'm in room_4 initially.
2. I'll pick up yellow_box_1.
3. I need to go to room_3 through red_door_1, so I need to first go to red_door_1 and unlock it.
4. I'll go to room_3 and drop yellow_box_1.
5. I need to pick up green_box_2 in room_3 (for constraint 6).
6. I'll go to room_1 through grey_door_2, so I first need to go to grey_door_2 and unlock it.
7. In room_1, I'll drop green_box_2.
8. I'll pick up grey_ball_1 in room_1.
9. I'll go to room_2 through grey_door_1, which means I need to go to grey_door_1 first and unlock it.
10. In room_2, I'll drop grey_ball_1.
11. I'll pick up red_box_1 in room_2.
12. I'll go back to room_4 through green_door_1, but first I need to go to green_door_1 and try to unlock it. But wait, I can't unlock green_door_1 here yet because of constraint 4. I need to have yellow_box_1 and red_door_1 should be unlocked.

Let me rethink the order...

I think the issue is that I need to carefully manage two objects: yellow_box_1 and grey_ball_1 to satisfy multiple constraints. 

Let's plan again, more carefully:

1. I'm in room_4 initially.
2. From constraint 2, if I'm in room_4, I must hold an object and be in room_1 at a later state. So I need to pick up an object (let's pick yellow_box_1) and ensure I eventually go to room_1.
3. From constraint 10, if I'm in front of grey_door_1, yellow_box_1 must have been in room_3 at an earlier state. So I need to move yellow_box_1 to room_3 before going in front of grey_door_1.
4. From constraint 8, if I'm in room_2, I must have held grey_ball_1 and some object earlier. So I need to pick up grey_ball_1 (which is in room_1) before going to room_2.
5. From constraint 6, if I'm in front of green_door_1, I must have held either green_box_2 or red_box_1 earlier. So I need to pick up one of these objects before going in front of green_door_1.
6. From constraint 4, if green_door_1 is unlocked, I must hold yellow_box_1 and red_door_1 should be unlocked.

Given these constraints, let's plan the action sequence:

1. I'm in room_4 initially.
2. I'll pick up yellow_box_1.
3. I need to go to room_3 to drop yellow_box_1, so I'll go to red_door_1, unlock it, and then go to room_3.
4. In room_3, I'll drop yellow_box_1 (to satisfy constraint 10).
5. I need to pick up green_box_2 in room_3 (to satisfy constraint 6).
6. I need to go to room_1 to pick up grey_ball_1, so I'll go to grey_door_2, unlock it, and then go to room_1.
7. In room_1, I'll drop green_box_2 and pick up grey_ball_1.
8. I need to go to room_2, so I'll go to grey_door_1, unlock it, and then go to room_2.
9. In room_2, I'll drop grey_ball_1 (satisfying constraint 7 and partially constraint 8).
10. I need to pick up red_box_1 in room_2.
11. I need to go back to room_3 to pick up yellow_box_1 again, so I'll go back to room_1 through grey_door_1, then to room_3 through grey_door_2.
12. In room_3, I'll drop red_box_1 and pick up yellow_box_1.
13. I need to go back to room_2 to unlock green_door_1, so I'll go back to room_1 through grey_door_2, then to room_2 through grey_door_1.
14. Now I'm in room_2, I need to go to green_door_1, but I need to be holding yellow_box_1 and red_door_1 should be unlocked.

Wait, this is getting too complex with multiple back-and-forth movements. Let's simplify and be more methodical.

Let's focus on the goal first: I need to be in front of a grey door that is unlocked. There are two grey doors: grey_door_1 (connecting room_1 and room_2) and grey_door_2 (connecting room_1 and room_3).

Since constraint 9 says I must be in front of grey_door_1 at some point, let's choose grey_door_1 as the door for the goal.

Working backwards from the goal, I need to:
1. Be in front of grey_door_1 (which is in room_1 or room_2).
2. Grey_door_1 should be unlocked.

From constraint 10, if I'm in front of grey_door_1, yellow_box_1 must have been in room_3 at an earlier state. So, at some point, I need to move yellow_box_1 from room_4 to room_3.

OK, going back to the beginning, let me make a simpler plan step by step. I'll keep track of the constraints as I go.

Initial State:
- I am in room_4.
- yellow_box_1 is in room_4.
- All doors are locked.

Plan:
1. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_4 -- Moving to the object
2. pick yellow_box_1 room_4 -- Picking it up
3. gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_3 -- Moving to the door between room_4 and room_3
4. toggle red_door_1 -- Unlocking the door
5. gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_1 -- Going to room_3
6. gotoempty -- Going to an empty position
7. drop yellow_box_1 room_3 -- Dropping the box to satisfy constraint 10
8. gotoobject green_box_2 room_3 -- Moving to green_box_2 to satisfy constraint 6
9. pick green_box_2 room_3 -- Picking it up
10. gotodoor grey_door_2 room_3 room_1 -- Moving to the door between room_3 and room_1
11. toggle grey_door_2 -- Unlocking the door
12. gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_2 -- Going to room_1
13. gotoempty -- Going to an empty position
14. drop green_box_2 room_1 -- Dropping it to free hands
15. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_1 -- Moving to grey_ball_1 to satisfy constraint 8
16. pick grey_ball_1 room_1 -- Picking it up (satisfying part of constraint 8)
17. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2 -- Moving to the door between room_1 and room_2
18. toggle grey_door_1 -- Unlocking the door
19. gotoroom room_1 room_2 grey_door_1 -- Going to room_2 (satisfying constraint 7)
20. gotoempty -- Going to an empty position
21. drop grey_ball_1 room_2 -- Dropping it to free hands

OK, let's check our progress:
- constraint 9: I must be in front of grey_door_1 at some point.
  - I was in front of grey_door_1 in step 17, so this is satisfied.
- constraint 10: If I'm in front of grey_door_1, yellow_box_1 must have been in room_3 at an earlier state.
  - I dropped yellow_box_1 in room_3 in step 7, which is before step 17, so this is satisfied.
- constraint 7: I must be in room_2 at some point.
  - I went to room_2 in step 19, so this is satisfied.
- constraint 8: If I'm in room_2, I must have held grey_ball_1 and some object earlier.
  - I held grey_ball_1 in step 16, which is before step 19, so this is partially satisfied.
  - I also held green_box_2 in step 9, which is also before step 19, so this is fully satisfied.
- constraint 5: I must be in front of green_door_1 at some point.
  - I haven't done this yet, so I need to include this in the plan.
- constraint 6: If I'm in front of green_door_1, I must have held either green_box_2 or red_box_1 earlier.
  - I held green_box_2 in step 9, so once I go in front of green_door_1, this will be satisfied.
- constraint 3: green_door_1 must be unlocked at some point.
  - I haven't done this yet, so I need to include this in the plan.
- constraint 4: If green_door_1 is unlocked, I must hold yellow_box_1 and red_door_1 should be unlocked.
  - red_door_1 is already unlocked (in step 4), so that part is satisfied.
  - But I need to be holding yellow_box_1 when I unlock green_door_1, which I'm not currently doing.
- constraint 1: I must be in room_4 at some point.
  - I was in room_4 at the beginning, so this is satisfied.
- constraint 2: If I'm in room_4, I must hold an object and be in room_1 at a later state.
  - I held yellow_box_1 in step 2 while in room_4, and I was in room_1 in steps 12-17, so this is satisfied.

So, I need to add more steps to the plan to satisfy the remaining constraints:
- I need to go in front of green_door_1 (constraint 5).
- I need to unlock green_door_1 (constraint 3) while holding yellow_box_1 (constraint 4).

Let's continue the plan:

22. gotoobject red_box_1 room_2 -- Moving to red_box_1
23. pick red_box_1 room_2 -- Picking it up
24. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_1 -- Going back to the door between room_2 and room_1
25. gotoroom room_2 room_1 grey_door_1 -- Going back to room_1
26. gotodoor grey_door_2 room_1 room_3 -- Going to the door between room_1 and room_3
27. gotoroom room_1 room_3 grey_door_2 -- Going to room_3
28. gotoempty -- Going to an empty position
29. drop red_box_1 room_3 -- Dropping it to free hands
30. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_3 -- Moving to yellow_box_1
31. pick yellow_box_1 room_3 -- Picking it up
32. gotodoor grey_door_2 room_3 room_1 -- Going to the door between room_3 and room_1
33. gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_2 -- Going to room_1
34. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2 -- Going to the door between room_1 and room_2
35. gotoroom room_1 room_2 grey_door_1 -- Going to room_2
36. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4 -- Going to the door between room_2 and room_4 (satisfying constraint 5)
37. toggle green_door_1 -- Unlocking the door (satisfying constraint 3) while holding yellow_box_1 (satisfying constraint 4)
38. gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1 -- Going to room_4
39. gotoempty -- Going to an empty position
40. drop yellow_box_1 room_4 -- Dropping it to free hands
41. gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_1 -- Going back to room_2
42. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_1 -- Going to the door between room_2 and room_1
43. gotoroom room_2 room_1 grey_door_1 -- Going to room_1
44. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2 -- Going to the door between room_1 and room_2 (this is for the goal)

Let's check the final plan against all the constraints:
- constraint 9: I must be in front of grey_door_1 at some point.
  - I'm in front of grey_door_1 in steps 17, 24, 34, 42, and 44, so this is satisfied.
- constraint 10: If I'm in front of grey_door_1, yellow_box_1 must have been in room_3 at an earlier state.
  - I dropped yellow_box_1 in room_3 in step 7, which is before steps 17, 24, 34, 42, and 44, so this is satisfied.
- constraint 7: I must be in room_2 at some point.
  - I'm in room_2 in steps 19-24 and steps 35-42, so this is satisfied.
- constraint 8: If I'm in room_2, I must have held grey_ball_1 and some object earlier.
  - I held grey_ball_1 in step 16, which is before steps 19-24 and 35-42, so this is satisfied.
  - I also held green_box_2 in step 9, which is before steps 19-24 and 35-42, so this is fully satisfied.
- constraint 5: I must be in front of green_door_1 at some point.
  - I'm in front of green_door_1 in step 36, so this is satisfied.
- constraint 6: If I'm in front of green_door_1, I must have held either green_box_2 or red_box_1 earlier.
  - I held green_box_2 in step 9 and red_box_1 in step 23, which are both before step 36, so this is satisfied.
- constraint 3: green_door_1 must be unlocked at some point.
  - I unlock green_door_1 in step 37, so this is satisfied.
- constraint 4: If green_door_1 is unlocked, I must hold yellow_box_1 and red_door_1 should be unlocked.
  - I unlock green_door_1 in step 37 while holding yellow_box_1 (picked up in step 31), and red_door_1 is already unlocked (in step 4), so this is satisfied.
- constraint 1: I must be in room_4 at some point.
  - I'm in room_4 at the beginning and in steps 38-40, so this is satisfied.
- constraint 2: If I'm in room_4, I must hold an object and be in room_1 at a later state.
  - I held yellow_box_1 in step 2 while in room_4 at the beginning, and I was in room_1 in steps 12-17, 25-27, and 33-35, which are all later, so this is satisfied.
  - Similarly, I'm in room_4 in steps 38-40, and I'm holding an object, and I'm in room_1 in step 43, which is later, so this is satisfied.

The goal is to be in front of a grey door that is unlocked. Grey_door_1 was unlocked in step 18, and I'm in front of it in step 44, so the goal is satisfied.

Ok nice, let's go with this plan (I'll convert to the exact format):

```
gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_4
pick yellow_box_1 room_4
gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_3
toggle red_door_1
gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_1
gotoempty
drop yellow_box_1 room_3
gotoobject green_box_2 room_3
pick green_box_2 room_3
gotodoor grey_door_2 room_3 room_1
toggle grey_door_2
gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_2
gotoempty
drop green_box_2 room_1
gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_1
pick grey_ball_1 room_1
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2
toggle grey_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_2 grey_door_1
gotoempty
drop grey_ball_1 room_2
gotoobject red_box_1 room_2
pick red_box_1 room_2
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_1
gotoroom room_2 room_1 grey_door_1
gotodoor grey_door_2 room_1 room_3
gotoroom room_1 room_3 grey_door_2
gotoempty
drop red_box_1 room_3
gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_3
pick yellow_box_1 room_3
gotodoor grey_door_2 room_3 room_1
gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_2
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2
gotoroom room_1 room_2 grey_door_1
gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4
toggle green_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1
gotoempty
drop yellow_box_1 room_4
gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_1
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_1
gotoroom room_2 room_1 grey_door_1
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2
```

But let me review this plan once more. The goal is to "There is a door d such that "The following conditions are all true: "d is grey", "you are in front of d", "d is not locked""".

In this case, d can be either grey_door_1 or grey_door_2. The final step puts me in front of grey_door_1, which is grey. I unlocked grey_door_1 in step 18, so it should still be unlocked when I'm in front of it in the final step.

Actually, let's simplify this plan. Since the goal is to be in front of a grey door that is unlocked, I could choose grey_door_2 as well and not have to do as many steps. Let me revisit the constraints to see if I can make a more efficient plan.

Actually, let me trace through the plan and see if I can do better:

I'm starting in room_4.
- gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_4: I'm in front of yellow_box_1 in room_4.
- pick yellow_box_1 room_4: I'm holding yellow_box_1 in room_4.

Constraint 2 check: If I'm in room_4, I need to hold an object and be in room_1 at a later state. I'm currently holding yellow_box_1, so I need to make sure I go to room_1 while holding an object.

- gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_3: I'm in front of red_door_1.
- toggle red_door_1: I unlock red_door_1.
- gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_1: I'm in room_3, holding yellow_box_1.
- gotoempty: I'm in front of an empty position in room_3, still holding yellow_box_1.
- drop yellow_box_1 room_3: I've dropped yellow_box_1 in room_3, and it's now in room_3. This satisfies the pre-condition for constraint 10.

Constraint 10 check: If I'm in front of grey_door_1, yellow_box_1 must have been in room_3 at an earlier state. I've dropped yellow_box_1 in room_3, so this condition is met.

- gotoobject green_box_2 room_3: I'm in front of green_box_2 in room_3.
- pick green_box_2 room_3: I'm holding green_box_2 in room_3.

Constraint 6 check: If I'm in front of green_door_1, I must have held either green_box_2 or red_box_1 earlier. I'm now holding green_box_2, so this condition will be met if I go in front of green_door_1 later.

- gotodoor grey_door_2 room_3 room_1: I'm in front of grey_door_2.
- toggle grey_door_2: I unlock grey_door_2.
- gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_2: I'm in room_1, holding green_box_2.

Constraint 2 check: If I'm in room_4, I need to hold an object and be in room_1 at a later state. I've just entered room_1 while holding green_box_2, so this condition is met.

- gotoempty: I'm in front of an empty position in room_1, still holding green_box_2.
- drop green_box_2 room_1: I've dropped green_box_2 in room_1, and it's now in room_1.
- gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_1: I'm in front of grey_ball_1 in room_1.
- pick grey_ball_1 room_1: I'm holding grey_ball_1 in room_1.

Constraint 8 check: If I'm in room_2, I must have held grey_ball_1 and some object earlier. I'm now holding grey_ball_1, and I've held green_box_2 earlier, so this condition will be met if I go to room_2 later.

- gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2: I'm in front of grey_door_1.

Constraint 9 check: I must be in front of grey_door_1 at some point. I'm now in front of grey_door_1, so this condition is met.

- toggle grey_door_1: I unlock grey_door_1.
- gotoroom room_1 room_2 grey_door_1: I'm in room_2, holding grey_ball_1.

Constraint 7 check: I must be in room_2 at some point. I'm now in room_2, so this condition is met.
Constraint 8 check: If I'm in room_2, I must have held grey_ball_1 and some object earlier. I've held grey_ball_1 and green_box_2 earlier, so this condition is met.

- gotoempty: I'm in front of an empty position in room_2, still holding grey_ball_1.
- drop grey_ball_1 room_2: I've dropped grey_ball_1 in room_2, and it's now in room_2.
- gotoobject red_box_1 room_2: I'm in front of red_box_1 in room_2.
- pick red_box_1 room_2: I'm holding red_box_1 in room_2.

Constraint 6 check: If I'm in front of green_door_1, I must have held either green_box_2 or red_box_1 earlier. I've held green_box_2 earlier, and I'm now holding red_box_1, so this condition will be met if I go in front of green_door_1 later.

I'm going back to room_1 > room_3 to pick up yellow_box_1 for constraint 4, because I need to be holding yellow_box_1 when I unlock green_door_1:

- gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_1: I'm in front of grey_door_1.
- gotoroom room_2 room_1 grey_door_1: I'm in room_1, holding red_box_1.
- gotodoor grey_door_2 room_1 room_3: I'm in front of grey_door_2.
- gotoroom room_1 room_3 grey_door_2: I'm in room_3, holding red_box_1.
- gotoempty: I'm in front of an empty position in room_3, still holding red_box_1.
- drop red_box_1 room_3: I've dropped red_box_1 in room_3, and it's now in room_3.
- gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_3: I'm in front of yellow_box_1 in room_3.
- pick yellow_box_1 room_3: I'm holding yellow_box_1 in room_3.

I'm heading back to room_2 > green_door_1 to unlock it:

- gotodoor grey_door_2 room_3 room_1: I'm in front of grey_door_2.
- gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_2: I'm in room_1, holding yellow_box_1.
- gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2: I'm in front of grey_door_1.
- gotoroom room_1 room_2 grey_door_1: I'm in room_2, holding yellow_box_1.
- gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4: I'm in front of green_door_1, holding yellow_box_1.

Constraint 5 check: I must be in front of green_door_1 at some point. I'm now in front of green_door_1, so this condition is met.
Constraint 6 check: If I'm in front of green_door_1, I must have held either green_box_2 or red_box_1 earlier. I've held both green_box_2 and red_box_1 earlier, so this condition is met.

- toggle green_door_1: I unlock green_door_1, while holding yellow_box_1 and having red_door_1 unlocked.

Constraint 3 check: green_door_1 must be unlocked at some point. I've just unlocked green_door_1, so this condition is met.
Constraint 4 check: If green_door_1 is unlocked, I must hold yellow_box_1 and red_door_1 should be unlocked. I'm holding yellow_box_1 and red_door_1 is unlocked, so this condition is met.

What is the minimum number of additional steps to satisfy the goal from here? 

Goal: Be in front of a grey door that is unlocked.

I've already unlocked grey_door_1 and grey_door_2, now I need to go back to one of them. Since the shortest path would be to go back to grey_door_1 from here, I'll choose that one.

- gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1: I'm in room_4, holding yellow_box_1.
- gotoempty: I'm in front of an empty position in room_4, still holding yellow_box_1.
- drop yellow_box_1 room_4: I've dropped yellow_box_1 in room_4, and it's now in room_4.
- gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_1: I'm in room_2.
- gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_1: I'm in front of grey_door_1.

Goal check: I'm in front of grey_door_1, which is a grey door, and it's unlocked. So the goal is satisfied.

Actually, I'm going to look at this again. The goal is: "There is a door d such that "The following conditions are all true: "d is grey", "you are in front of d", "d is not locked""".

grey_door_1 and grey_door_2 are both grey doors. I've unlocked both of them, so I just need to be in front of one of them. 

Let's revise the final part of the plan. After steps 1-36 (unlocking green_door_1), I have these options to complete the goal:

Option 1: Go back to grey_door_1.
- gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1: I'm in room_4, holding yellow_box_1.
- gotoempty: I'm in front of an empty position in room_4, still holding yellow_box_1.
- drop yellow_box_1 room_4: I've dropped yellow_box_1 in room_4, and it's now in room_4.
- gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_1: I'm in room_2.
- gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_1: I'm in front of grey_door_1.

Option 2: Go back to grey_door_2.
- gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1: I'm in room_4, holding yellow_box_1.
- gotoempty: I'm in front of an empty position in room_4, still holding yellow_box_1.
- drop yellow_box_1 room_4: I've dropped yellow_box_1 in room_4, and it's now in room_4.
- gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_1: I'm in room_3.
- gotodoor grey_door_2 room_3 room_1: I'm in front of grey_door_2.

Option 1 requires 5 steps, while Option 2 requires 5 steps too. Since both are equally efficient, I'll go with Option 1, which is to go back to grey_door_1.

So the final plan is:

```
gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_4
pick yellow_box_1 room_4
gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_3
toggle red_door_1
gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_1
gotoempty
drop yellow_box_1 room_3
gotoobject green_box_2 room_3
pick green_box_2 room_3
gotodoor grey_door_2 room_3 room_1
toggle grey_door_2
gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_2
gotoempty
drop green_box_2 room_1
gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_1
pick grey_ball_1 room_1
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2
toggle grey_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_2 grey_door_1
gotoempty
drop grey_ball_1 room_2
gotoobject red_box_1 room_2
pick red_box_1 room_2
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_1
gotoroom room_2 room_1 grey_door_1
gotodoor grey_door_2 room_1 room_3
gotoroom room_1 room_3 grey_door_2
gotoempty
drop red_box_1 room_3
gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_3
pick yellow_box_1 room_3
gotodoor grey_door_2 room_3 room_1
gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_2
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2
gotoroom room_1 room_2 grey_door_1
gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4
toggle green_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1
gotoempty
drop yellow_box_1 room_4
gotoroom room_4 room_2 green_door_1
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_1
```

Actually, I realized we can make this plan shorter. After I've unlocked grey_door_1 and I'm in room_2 (steps 1-20), I could check to see if I can perform these steps:

1. Pick up red_box_1.
2. Go in front of green_door_1.
3. Unlock green_door_1 (to satisfy constraint 3).
4. Go back to grey_door_1 to satisfy the goal.

But I can't do this because constraint 4 says: "If green_door_1 is not locked, then 'you are holding yellow_box_1 and red_door_1 is not locked' must hold at s or at some state after s." And yellow_box_1 is in room_3 at this point, not in my hands. So I do need to go back to pick up yellow_box_1, which means the version of the plan I have is necessary.

Upon another review, I can't see any obvious optimizations to make the plan shorter. Let's stick with the plan above.

Wait, what if I don't need to unlock green_door_1 at all? The goal doesn't require it. Let me check the constraints once more.

Constraints:
1. I must be in room_4 at some point.
2. If I'm in room_4, I must hold an object and be in room_1 at a later state.
3. green_door_1 must be unlocked at some point.
4. If green_door_1 is unlocked, I must hold yellow_box_1 and red_door_1 should be unlocked.
5. I must be in front of green_door_1 at some point.
6. If I'm in front of green_door_1, I must have held either green_box_2 or red_box_1 earlier.
7. I must be in room_2 at some point.
8. If I'm in room_2, I must have held grey_ball_1 and some object earlier.
9. I must be in front of grey_door_1 at some point.
10. If I'm in front of grey_door_1, yellow_box_1 must have been in room_3 at an earlier state.

Okay, constraint 3 explicitly says green_door_1 must be unlocked at some point, so I do need to unlock it. I'm going to stick with the plan.
