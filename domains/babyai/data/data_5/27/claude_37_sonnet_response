Let me understand the planning problem:

We are in a gridworld consisting of 4 rooms:
- room_1 (north-west)
- room_2 (south-west)
- room_3 (north-east)
- room_4 (south-east)

These rooms are connected by doors:
- blue_door_1 connects room_1 and room_2
- red_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3
- purple_door_1 connects room_2 and room_4
- blue_door_2 connects room_3 and room_4

Initial state:
- We are in room_4
- All doors are locked
- There are objects in various rooms: balls and boxes of different colors
- We have visited room_4
- We're not holding any object

Goal:
- There exists a blue door that connects room_1 and room_2 (which must be blue_door_1)
- We are in front of that door
- That door is unlocked

Constraints:
1. We cannot be in room_2 at any state
2. We must hold red_box_1 at some state
3. purple_door_1 must remain locked in every state
4. At some state, we must be in front of red_door_1 while holding grey_ball_1
5. At some state, grey_ball_2 must be in room_4 and we must be in front of yellow_box_2

Let's think about how to approach this:

First, we need to be in room_1 to be in front of blue_door_1 (the door connecting room_1 and room_2). Since we can't go through room_2 (constraint 1), we need to go from room_4 → room_3 → room_1.

To satisfy constraint 4, we need to pick up grey_ball_1 (which is initially in room_1) and then be in front of red_door_1.

To satisfy constraint 2, we need to pick up red_box_1 (which is initially in room_1) at some point.

To satisfy constraint 5, we need to move grey_ball_2 from room_1 to room_4, and also at some point be in front of yellow_box_2 (which is in room_3).

Let's start planning:

1. We begin in room_4
2. We need to unlock blue_door_2 to move to room_3
   - gotodoor blue_door_2 room_4 room_3
   - toggle blue_door_2
3. Go to room_3
   - gotoroom room_4 room_3 blue_door_2
4. Be in front of yellow_box_2 to satisfy part of constraint 5
   - gotoobject yellow_box_2 room_3
5. We need to unlock red_door_1 to move to room_1
   - gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1
   - toggle red_door_1
6. Go to room_1
   - gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1
7. Pick up grey_ball_1 for constraint 4
   - gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_1
   - pick grey_ball_1 room_1
8. Go in front of red_door_1 while holding grey_ball_1 to satisfy constraint 4
   - gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3
9. Drop grey_ball_1 to free our hands
   - gotoempty
   - drop grey_ball_1 room_1
10. Pick up grey_ball_2 to move it to room_4 for constraint 5
    - gotoobject grey_ball_2 room_1
    - pick grey_ball_2 room_1
11. Go back to room_3
    - gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3
    - gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1
12. Go to room_4
    - gotodoor blue_door_2 room_3 room_4
    - gotoroom room_3 room_4 blue_door_2
13. Drop grey_ball_2 in room_4 to satisfy part of constraint 5
    - gotoempty
    - drop grey_ball_2 room_4
14. Go back to room_3
    - gotodoor blue_door_2 room_4 room_3
    - gotoroom room_4 room_3 blue_door_2
15. Go to room_1
    - gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1
    - gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1
16. Pick up red_box_1 to satisfy constraint 2
    - gotoobject red_box_1 room_1
    - pick red_box_1 room_1
17. Drop red_box_1 as we need to free our hands
    - gotoempty
    - drop red_box_1 room_1
18. Now, we need to unlock blue_door_1 and be in front of it
    - gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2
    - toggle blue_door_1
19. We should now be in front of the unlocked blue_door_1, satisfying the goal

Let me check if this plan satisfies all the constraints:

1. We never enter room_2 ✓ (we only unlock blue_door_1, but never go through it)
2. We hold red_box_1 at some point ✓ (steps 16-17)
3. purple_door_1 remains locked ✓ (we never toggle it)
4. We are in front of red_door_1 while holding grey_ball_1 ✓ (step 8)
5. grey_ball_2 is in room_4 and we are in front of yellow_box_2 ✓ (steps 4 and 13)

Actually, I need to make sure these constraints are satisfied simultaneously where required. Let me refine the plan:

Constraint 5 requires that in some state, both grey_ball_2 is in room_4 AND we are in front of yellow_box_2. This means we need to ensure both conditions hold at the same time. Let's adjust the plan.

Actually, I think I misunderstood. The constraints are:
1. "you are not in room_2" (must hold in every state) - we never go to room_2, so this is satisfied
2. "you are holding red_box_1" (must hold in at least one state) - we pick up red_box_1, so this is satisfied
3. "purple_door_1 is locked" (must hold in every state) - we never toggle purple_door_1, so it stays locked
4. "you are in front of red_door_1" AND "you are holding grey_ball_1" (must hold in at least one state) - we do this in step 8
5. "grey_ball_2 is in room_4" AND "you are in front of yellow_box_2" (must hold in at least one state)

For constraint 5, we need to have both conditions satisfied simultaneously. This is tricky because yellow_box_2 is in room_3 and we need grey_ball_2 to be in room_4. We need to reconsider our plan.

Actually, I think I was mistaken about constraint 5. It says that "grey_ball_2 is in room_4" AND "you are in front of yellow_box_2" must hold in at least one state. This doesn't necessarily mean they must hold simultaneously in the same state. They might be required to hold individually in at least one state. But to be safe, let's try to satisfy both in the same state.

Let me revise the plan:

1. We begin in room_4
2. Unlock blue_door_2 to move to room_3
   - gotodoor blue_door_2 room_4 room_3
   - toggle blue_door_2
3. Go to room_3
   - gotoroom room_4 room_3 blue_door_2
4. Unlock red_door_1 to move to room_1
   - gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1
   - toggle red_door_1
5. Go to room_1
   - gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1
6. Pick up grey_ball_1 for constraint 4
   - gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_1
   - pick grey_ball_1 room_1
7. Go in front of red_door_1 while holding grey_ball_1 to satisfy constraint 4
   - gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3
8. Drop grey_ball_1 to free our hands
   - gotoempty
   - drop grey_ball_1 room_1
9. Pick up red_box_1 to satisfy constraint 2
   - gotoobject red_box_1 room_1
   - pick red_box_1 room_1
10. Drop red_box_1 (as we'll need our hands free)
    - gotoempty
    - drop red_box_1 room_1
11. Pick up grey_ball_2 to move it to room_4 for constraint 5
    - gotoobject grey_ball_2 room_1
    - pick grey_ball_2 room_1
12. Go to room_3
    - gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3
    - gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1
13. Go to room_4
    - gotodoor blue_door_2 room_3 room_4
    - gotoroom room_3 room_4 blue_door_2
14. Drop grey_ball_2 in room_4
    - gotoempty
    - drop grey_ball_2 room_4
15. Go back to room_3
    - gotodoor blue_door_2 room_4 room_3
    - gotoroom room_4 room_3 blue_door_2
16. Go in front of yellow_box_2 (at this point, grey_ball_2 is in room_4) to satisfy constraint 5
    - gotoobject yellow_box_2 room_3
17. Go back to room_1
    - gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1
    - gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1
18. Unlock blue_door_1 and be in front of it for the goal
    - gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2
    - toggle blue_door_1

This plan satisfies all constraints:
1. We never enter room_2
2. We hold red_box_1 at some point (steps 9-10)
3. purple_door_1 remains locked
4. We are in front of red_door_1 while holding grey_ball_1 (step 7)
5. grey_ball_2 is in room_4 and we are in front of yellow_box_2 (This occurs after step 16, as we dropped grey_ball_2 in room_4 and are now in front of yellow_box_2)

But there's still an issue with constraint 5. In step 16, we are in front of yellow_box_2 in room_3, while grey_ball_2 is in room_4. These conditions are true at the same time but in different rooms. I need to determine whether "grey_ball_2 is in room_4" AND "you are in front of yellow_box_2" need to be true in the exact same state.

Actually, let me check the exact wording again:

"The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'The following conditions are all true: "grey_ball_2 is in room_4", "you are in front of yellow_box_2"'"

The phrase "The following conditions are all true" makes me think these conditions do need to be true simultaneously in the same state. But it's physically impossible to be in front of yellow_box_2 (in room_3) while grey_ball_2 is in room_4, because an agent can only be in one room at a time.

Could the constraint possibly mean we need to move yellow_box_2 to room_4 as well? Let me try to incorporate that:

1. We begin in room_4
2. Unlock blue_door_2 to move to room_3
   - gotodoor blue_door_2 room_4 room_3
   - toggle blue_door_2
3. Go to room_3
   - gotoroom room_4 room_3 blue_door_2
4. Pick up yellow_box_2 to later satisfy constraint 5
   - gotoobject yellow_box_2 room_3
   - pick yellow_box_2 room_3
5. Go to room_4
   - gotodoor blue_door_2 room_3 room_4
   - gotoroom room_3 room_4 blue_door_2
6. Drop yellow_box_2 in room_4
   - gotoempty
   - drop yellow_box_2 room_4
7. Go back to room_3
   - gotodoor blue_door_2 room_4 room_3
   - gotoroom room_4 room_3 blue_door_2
8. Unlock red_door_1 to move to room_1
   - gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1
   - toggle red_door_1
9. Go to room_1
   - gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1
10. Pick up grey_ball_1 for constraint 4
    - gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_1
    - pick grey_ball_1 room_1
11. Go in front of red_door_1 while holding grey_ball_1 to satisfy constraint 4
    - gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3
12. Drop grey_ball_1 to free our hands
    - gotoempty
    - drop grey_ball_1 room_1
13. Pick up red_box_1 to satisfy constraint 2
    - gotoobject red_box_1 room_1
    - pick red_box_1 room_1
14. Drop red_box_1 (as we'll need our hands free)
    - gotoempty
    - drop red_box_1 room_1
15. Pick up grey_ball_2 to move it to room_4 for constraint 5
    - gotoobject grey_ball_2 room_1
    - pick grey_ball_2 room_1
16. Go to room_3
    - gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3
    - gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1
17. Go to room_4
    - gotodoor blue_door_2 room_3 room_4
    - gotoroom room_3 room_4 blue_door_2
18. Drop grey_ball_2 in room_4
    - gotoempty
    - drop grey_ball_2 room_4
19. Go in front of yellow_box_2 (now in room_4) while grey_ball_2 is also in room_4 to satisfy constraint 5
    - gotoobject yellow_box_2 room_4
20. Go back to room_3
    - gotodoor blue_door_2 room_4 room_3
    - gotoroom room_4 room_3 blue_door_2
21. Go to room_1
    - gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1
    - gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1
22. Unlock blue_door_1 and be in front of it for the goal
    - gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2
    - toggle blue_door_1

This plan satisfies all constraints:
1. We never enter room_2
2. We hold red_box_1 at some point (steps 13-14)
3. purple_door_1 remains locked
4. We are in front of red_door_1 while holding grey_ball_1 (step 11)
5. grey_ball_2 is in room_4 and we are in front of yellow_box_2 (step 19, both are in room_4)

Actually, let me verify the plan step by step to make sure all actions are valid and all constraints are satisfied:

1. We begin in room_4
2. gotodoor blue_door_2 room_4 room_3 - Valid because we're in room_4
3. toggle blue_door_2 - Valid because we're in front of blue_door_2
4. gotoroom room_4 room_3 blue_door_2 - Valid because blue_door_2 is now unlocked
5. gotoobject yellow_box_2 room_3 - Valid because we're in room_3 and yellow_box_2 is in room_3
6. pick yellow_box_2 room_3 - Valid because we're in front of yellow_box_2 and our hands are empty
7. gotodoor blue_door_2 room_3 room_4 - Valid because we're in room_3
8. gotoroom room_3 room_4 blue_door_2 - Valid because blue_door_2 is unlocked
9. gotoempty - Valid
10. drop yellow_box_2 room_4 - Valid because we're holding yellow_box_2 and are in front of an empty position
11. gotodoor blue_door_2 room_4 room_3 - Valid because we're in room_4
12. gotoroom room_4 room_3 blue_door_2 - Valid because blue_door_2 is unlocked
13. gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1 - Valid because we're in room_3
14. toggle red_door_1 - Valid because we're in front of red_door_1
15. gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1 - Valid because red_door_1 is now unlocked
16. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_1 - Valid because we're in room_1 and grey_ball_1 is in room_1
17. pick grey_ball_1 room_1 - Valid because we're in front of grey_ball_1 and our hands are empty
18. gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3 - Valid because we're in room_1
19. gotoempty - Valid
20. drop grey_ball_1 room_1 - Valid because we're holding grey_ball_1 and are in front of an empty position
21. gotoobject red_box_1 room_1 - Valid because we're in room_1 and red_box_1 is in room_1
22. pick red_box_1 room_1 - Valid because we're in front of red_box_1 and our hands are empty
23. gotoempty - Valid
24. drop red_box_1 room_1 - Valid because we're holding red_box_1 and are in front of an empty position
25. gotoobject grey_ball_2 room_1 - Valid because we're in room_1 and grey_ball_2 is in room_1
26. pick grey_ball_2 room_1 - Valid because we're in front of grey_ball_2 and our hands are empty
27. gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3 - Valid because we're in room_1
28. gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1 - Valid because red_door_1 is unlocked
29. gotodoor blue_door_2 room_3 room_4 - Valid because we're in room_3
30. gotoroom room_3 room_4 blue_door_2 - Valid because blue_door_2 is unlocked
31. gotoempty - Valid
32. drop grey_ball_2 room_4 - Valid because we're holding grey_ball_2 and are in front of an empty position
33. gotoobject yellow_box_2 room_4 - Valid because we're in room_4 and yellow_box_2 is now in room_4
34. gotodoor blue_door_2 room_4 room_3 - Valid because we're in room_4
35. gotoroom room_4 room_3 blue_door_2 - Valid because blue_door_2 is unlocked
36. gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1 - Valid because we're in room_3
37. gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1 - Valid because red_door_1 is unlocked
38. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2 - Valid because we're in room_1
39. toggle blue_door_1 - Valid because we're in front of blue_door_1

This should be a valid plan that satisfies all constraints and achieves the goal.

Hmm, I've just realized that in my step 18-19 I went from "gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3" directly to "gotoempty" without going through the door. This means I'm still in room_1, not room_3. Let me fix that.

Actually, let me just re-do this plan more carefully:

1. We begin in room_4
2. gotodoor blue_door_2 room_4 room_3 - We're now in front of blue_door_2
3. toggle blue_door_2 - blue_door_2 is now unlocked
4. gotoroom room_4 room_3 blue_door_2 - We're now in room_3
5. gotoobject yellow_box_2 room_3 - We're now in front of yellow_box_2
6. pick yellow_box_2 room_3 - We're now holding yellow_box_2
7. gotodoor blue_door_2 room_3 room_4 - We're now in front of blue_door_2
8. gotoroom room_3 room_4 blue_door_2 - We're now in room_4
9. gotoempty - We're now in front of an empty position
10. drop yellow_box_2 room_4 - yellow_box_2 is now in room_4, we're not holding anything
11. gotodoor blue_door_2 room_4 room_3 - We're now in front of blue_door_2
12. gotoroom room_4 room_3 blue_door_2 - We're now in room_3
13. gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1 - We're now in front of red_door_1
14. toggle red_door_1 - red_door_1 is now unlocked
15. gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1 - We're now in room_1
16. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_1 - We're now in front of grey_ball_1
17. pick grey_ball_1 room_1 - We're now holding grey_ball_1
18. gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3 - We're now in front of red_door_1 while holding grey_ball_1 (satisfying constraint 4)
19. gotoempty - We're now in front of an empty position
20. drop grey_ball_1 room_1 - We're now not holding anything, grey_ball_1 is in room_1
21. gotoobject red_box_1 room_1 - We're now in front of red_box_1
22. pick red_box_1 room_1 - We're now holding red_box_1 (satisfying constraint 2)
23. gotoempty - We're now in front of an empty position
24. drop red_box_1 room_1 - We're now not holding anything, red_box_1 is in room_1
25. gotoobject grey_ball_2 room_1 - We're now in front of grey_ball_2
26. pick grey_ball_2 room_1 - We're now holding grey_ball_2
27. gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3 - We're now in front of red_door_1
28. gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1 - We're now in room_3
29. gotodoor blue_door_2 room_3 room_4 - We're now in front of blue_door_2
30. gotoroom room_3 room_4 blue_door_2 - We're now in room_4
31. gotoempty - We're now in front of an empty position
32. drop grey_ball_2 room_4 - We're now not holding anything, grey_ball_2 is in room_4
33. gotoobject yellow_box_2 room_4 - We're now in front of yellow_box_2 while grey_ball_2 is in room_4 (satisfying constraint 5)
34. gotodoor blue_door_2 room_4 room_3 - We're now in front of blue_door_2
35. gotoroom room_4 room_3 blue_door_2 - We're now in room_3
36. gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1 - We're now in front of red_door_1
37. gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1 - We're now in room_1
38. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2 - We're now in front of blue_door_1
39. toggle blue_door_1 - blue_door_1 is now unlocked

At the end of this plan, we're in front of blue_door_1, which is a blue door connecting room_1 and room_2, and it is unlocked. Thus, we've achieved the goal. Also, all constraints are satisfied.

Our final plan is:

1. gotodoor blue_door_2 room_4 room_3
2. toggle blue_door_2
3. gotoroom room_4 room_3 blue_door_2
4. gotoobject yellow_box_2 room_3
5. pick yellow_box_2 room_3
6. gotodoor blue_door_2 room_3 room_4
7. gotoroom room_3 room_4 blue_door_2
8. gotoempty
9. drop yellow_box_2 room_4
10. gotodoor blue_door_2 room_4 room_3
11. gotoroom room_4 room_3 blue_door_2
12. gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1
13. toggle red_door_1
14. gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1
15. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_1
16. pick grey_ball_1 room_1
17. gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3

23. drop red_box_1 room_1
24. gotoobject grey_ball_2 room_1
25. pick grey_ball_2 room_1
26. gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3
27. gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1
28. gotodoor blue_door_2 room_3 room_4
29. gotoroom room_3 room_4 blue_door_2
30. gotoempty
31. drop grey_ball_2 room_4
32. gotoobject yellow_box_2 room_4
33. gotodoor blue_door_2 room_4 room_3
34. gotoroom room_4 room_3 blue_door_2
35. gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1
36. gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1
37. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2
38. toggle blue_door_1
