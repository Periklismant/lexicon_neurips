Okay, let's tackle this planning problem step by step. The goal is to get to a purple door (which connects room_3 and room_4) that's unlocked, be in front of it, and satisfy all the constraints. Let's break down the problem.

First, the initial state: The agent is in room_2. All doors are locked. The purple door (purple_door_1) connects room_3 and room_4. To unlock it, the agent needs to toggle it, which requires being in front of it. But to get to room_3 or room_4, the agent has to go through other locked doors. So, the agent needs to unlock some doors first.

Looking at the doors: red_door_1 connects room_1 and room_2. Blue_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3. Blue_door_2 connects room_2 and room_4. Purple_door_1 connects room_3 and room_4. All are locked initially.

Constraints to consider:

1. Must be in front of blue_door_2 at least once. But whenever that happens, the agent must have previously held purple_ball_1. Also, blue_door_2 must always remain locked. So, even if the agent goes to blue_door_2, they can't toggle it. So maybe they just go in front of it but don't unlock it.

2. Must be in room_4 at least once. But entering room_4 requires that in some prior state, either red_ball_1 is in room_4 or the agent is holding something. Since red_ball_1 starts in room_1, that's not possible unless moved. But the agent can carry an object when entering room_4.

3. At least once, the agent is holding purple_ball_1 or empty is in room_3. Empty is a position, so maybe moving an object out of room_3? But purple_ball_1 is in room_3 initially. If the agent picks it up, that would satisfy the condition.

4. At least once, the agent is holding an object and in front of yellow_box_1. Yellow_box_1 is in room_1, so the agent needs to go to room_1, be in front of it while holding something.

So the plan needs to:

- Get to room_3 to access purple_door_1.

But to get to room_3 from room_2, possible paths:

From room_2, doors are red_door_1 (to room_1) and blue_door_2 (to room_4). To reach room_3, maybe go from room_1 via blue_door_1 to room_3. But room_1 is connected via red_door_1 from room_2. So agent needs to unlock red_door_1 first.

Wait, initial state: red_door_1 is locked. So agent is in room_2. To unlock red_door_1, they need to be in front of it. So they can go to red_door_1 from room_2, unlock it, then go to room_1.

Wait, "gotodoor d r1 r2": preconditions are that you are in a room connected by d, and no object is blocking the position in front of d in the current room. Since room_2 has red_door_1 connected to room_1. So the agent can go to red_door_1 from room_2. Then toggle (unlock) it. Then go to room_1 via red_door_1.

Once in room_1, then can go to blue_door_1 (connecting room_1 and room_3). But blue_door_1 is locked. So need to toggle it. So from room_1, go to blue_door_1, toggle it, then go to room_3.

In room_3, purple_door_1 connects to room_4. But it's locked. Need to unlock it. So go to purple_door_1 in room_3, toggle it (unlock), then go to room_4 via purple_door_1. But wait, the goal is to be in front of a purple door (purple_door_1) that's unlocked. So maybe after unlocking it, just stay in front of it. But the goal requires that the agent is in front of d (the purple door) and d is not locked. So maybe after unlocking it, the agent is already in front of it, so that's the goal.

Wait, the goal is "There is a door d such that d is purple, connects room_3 and room_4, you are in front of d, and d is not locked." So the final state must have the agent in front of purple_door_1, which is unlocked.

But the agent starts in room_2. Let's outline the steps:

1. Unlock red_door_1 (room_2 to room_1). But how?

To unlock red_door_1, agent must be in front of it. Since agent is in room_2, they can go to red_door_1 (gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_1). Then toggle it, which unlocks it.

Then, go from room_2 to room_1 via red_door_1 (gotoroom room_2 room_1 red_door_1). Now in room_1.

Now, in room_1, need to get to blue_door_1 (connecting to room_3), which is locked. So go to blue_door_1 in room_1 (gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_3), toggle to unlock it. Then go to room_3 via blue_door_1.

In room_3, go to purple_door_1 (gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_4), toggle to unlock it. Now, the agent is in front of purple_door_1, which is unlocked. That's the goal.

But wait, the constraints:

- Must be in front of blue_door_2 at least once. When? Maybe after going to room_4.

Wait, the agent needs to be in room_4 at least once. So after unlocking purple_door_1, the agent can go to room_4 via purple_door_1. But then, how to get to blue_door_2 (which is in room_2 and room_4). Blue_door_2 is locked and must remain locked. So the agent can't go through blue_door_2, but can be in front of it in room_4.

Wait, blue_door_2 connects room_2 and room_4. So from room_4, the agent can go to blue_door_2 (gotodoor blue_door_2 room_4 room_2). But the door is locked. But the constraint says blue_door_2 must always be locked. So agent can go in front of it but can't toggle it. Also, the agent must have held purple_ball_1 before being in front of blue_door_2.

So steps after unlocking purple_door_1:

- In room_3, after unlocking purple_door_1, go to room_4 via gotoroom room_3 room_4 purple_door_1. Now in room_4.

Now, in room_4, need to satisfy the constraint of being in room_4, which requires that in a prior state, either the agent was holding something or red_ball_1 was in room_4. Since red_ball_1 starts in room_1 and hasn't been moved, the agent must have been holding something before entering room_4. When entering room_4 from room_3 via purple_door_1, the agent must have been holding something before that. So perhaps the agent picks up purple_ball_1 in room_3 before going to room_4.

So steps:

After unlocking blue_door_1 and entering room_3:

- In room_3, there's purple_ball_1 and green_box_1. So the agent can pick up purple_ball_1.

But to pick up, need to be in front of it. So gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_3, then pick purple_ball_1 room_3. Now holding it.

Then, go to purple_door_1 (gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_4), toggle to unlock. Then, gotoroom room_3 room_4 purple_door_1 to enter room_4. Since the agent is holding purple_ball_1 when entering room_4, this satisfies the constraint that upon entering room_4, the agent was holding something.

Now in room_4. Need to go to blue_door_2 (which connects to room_2). So gotodoor blue_door_2 room_4 room_2. Since blue_door_2 is locked, but the agent just needs to be in front of it. But before this step, the agent was holding purple_ball_1. So this satisfies the constraint that when in front of blue_door_2, they previously held purple_ball_1.

Then, maybe drop purple_ball_1 in room_4? But the constraints don't require that. However, the agent needs to drop it somewhere if they are to do other actions, but let's see.

Also, the agent needs to at some point be holding an object and in front of yellow_box_1 (which is in room_1). So maybe after handling room_4, the agent needs to go back to room_1, pick up yellow_box_1 (but it's a box; can they pick up boxes? The objects are boxes and balls. The actions are pick and drop, which apply to objects. So yes, as long as they are in the same room and not holding anything.

Wait, the problem says "boxes and balls" are objects, so the agent can pick them up. So the agent could pick up yellow_box_1 in room_1. But the constraint is to be holding some object and in front of yellow_box_1. Wait, but if the agent is holding yellow_box_1, then they can't be in front of it, because when you pick up an object, you are no longer in front of it. Wait, the effect of pick is that you are no longer in front of x, and x is no longer in the room. So to be in front of yellow_box_1 while holding some object, the agent must be holding a different object and be in front of yellow_box_1.

Hmm. So the agent needs to be holding, say, red_ball_1 (from room_1) and be in front of yellow_box_1. So steps:

From room_1, gotoobject yellow_box_1, then pick it up? Wait, no, because after picking it up, they are not in front of it anymore. So maybe:

Go to room_1, pick up red_ball_1, then go to yellow_box_1 (while holding red_ball_1), then drop red_ball_1? But that would require being in front of yellow_box_1 while holding red_ball_1. Wait, but to drop an object, you need to be in front of an empty position. So maybe:

Alternative approach: After entering room_1, pick up red_ball_1. Then, gotoempty (to be in front of empty spot), then gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_1. Wait, but when you go to yellow_box_1, you are in front of it. But you are holding red_ball_1. So at that moment, you are holding some object and in front of yellow_box_1. That satisfies the constraint.

So the plan needs to include that step.

Putting this all together:

1. Initial state: room_2, holding nothing.

2. Go to red_door_1 from room_2: gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_1.

3. Toggle red_door_1 to unlock it.

4. Gotoroom room_2 room_1 red_door_1 (now in room_1).

5. Go to blue_door_1: gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_3.

6. Toggle blue_door_1 to unlock it.

7. Gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_1 (now in room_3).

8. Go to purple_ball_1: gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_3.

9. Pick purple_ball_1 room_3 (now holding it).

10. Go to purple_door_1: gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_4.

11. Toggle purple_door_1 to unlock it.

12. Gotoroom room_3 room_4 purple_door_1 (now in room_4, holding purple_ball_1).

13. Go to blue_door_2 in room_4: gotodoor blue_door_2 room_4 room_2. (This satisfies the constraint of being in front of blue_door_2, and since we were holding purple_ball_1 earlier, that's okay.)

14. Now, need to get back to room_1 to handle the yellow_box_1 constraint. But how? Since blue_door_2 is locked, can't go back to room_2. So maybe via purple_door_1 back to room_3, then room_1 via blue_door_1.

15. So from room_4, go back to room_3 via purple_door_1: gotoroom room_4 room_3 purple_door_1.

16. From room_3, go to blue_door_1 (already unlocked), go back to room_1.

17. Then, in room_1, need to pick up red_ball_1.

Wait, but red_ball_1 is in room_1. So:

18. Gotoobject red_ball_1 room_1.

19. Pick red_ball_1 room_1.

20. Then gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_1. (But after picking red_ball_1, you're no longer in front of it. So need to go to yellow_box_1 while holding red_ball_1.)

Wait, after picking red_ball_1, you are no longer in front of it. So the agent needs to go to yellow_box_1's location.

So steps after picking red_ball_1:

21. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_1. Now, since the agent is holding red_ball_1 and is in front of yellow_box_1, this satisfies the constraint of holding some object and being in front of yellow_box_1.

Then, perhaps drop red_ball_1 somewhere, but not necessary unless needed for the plan.

But the main goal is to be in front of purple_door_1 (unlocked) in the end. So after handling the constraints, the agent needs to go back to room_3, go to purple_door_1, and be in front of it.

Wait, but after step 11, the agent was in front of purple_door_1, toggled it (unlocked), then went to room_4. But the goal requires being in front of d (purple_door_1) and d is unlocked. So perhaps the final action should be to be in front of purple_door_1 after unlocking it.

Wait, let's check the steps:

At step 10: agent is in front of purple_door_1 (room_3 side).

Step 11: toggle it (unlocks it).

Step 12: agent uses gotoroom to go to room_4, so they are no longer in front of purple_door_1.

So to satisfy the goal, after unlocking purple_door_1, the agent must be in front of it. So maybe after step 11, instead of immediately going to room_4, stay in room_3, in front of purple_door_1. But the problem is the goal requires that the door is unlocked and you are in front of it.

Wait, step 11: toggle unlocks purple_door_1. So after that, the agent is still in front of purple_door_1 (since toggle doesn't move them). So that would satisfy the goal: d is purple (purple_door_1), connects room_3 and room_4, agent is in front of it, and it's unlocked.

But then why does the agent need to go to room_4? Because the constraints require being in room_4 at least once. So perhaps after achieving the goal, the agent must go to room_4, but that would mean the goal is already achieved before that. But the final state must be the one where the goal is met. So maybe the plan should end at step 11 and step 12 is unnecessary? But then the constraint of being in room_4 is not met.

So the problem is: the goal is to have the final state where the agent is in front of the purple door, which is unlocked. But the agent also needs to have been in room_4 at least once. So the plan must include going to room_4, but after that, return to room_3 and be in front of the purple door again.

Alternatively, perhaps the plan can first go to room_4 (satisfy that constraint) and then return to room_3 to be in front of the purple door.

So let's rework the steps:

After step 12 (agent is in room_4), they need to go back to room_3 via purple_door_1 (since it's unlocked), then go to purple_door_1 again in room_3.

So steps:

12. Gotoroom room_3 room_4 purple_door_1 (enter room_4, now in room_4, satisfies the "be in room_4" constraint).

13. Gotoroom room_4 room_3 purple_door_1 (back to room_3).

14. Gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_4 (now in front of it, which is unlocked).

Now, the goal is satisfied: in front of purple_door_1, which is unlocked.

But also, the constraints:

- Must be in front of blue_door_2: when in room_4, the agent can go to blue_door_2.

So between steps 12 and 13:

After step 12 (in room_4):

13. Gotodoor blue_door_2 room_4 room_2 (now in front of blue_door_2, which satisfies the constraint, and since they were holding purple_ball_1 earlier, this meets the constraint that before being in front of blue_door_2, they held purple_ball_1).

But wait, when did they drop purple_ball_1? Because to pick up red_ball_1 later, they need to be free. So after step 12 (in room_4), maybe they need to drop purple_ball_1.

Wait, let's retrace:

After step 9: agent is holding purple_ball_1.

Step 10: goto purple_door_1.

Step 11: toggle (unlock).

Step 12: gotoroom to room_4, still holding purple_ball_1.

Step 13: goto blue_door_2 in room_4 (gotodoor blue_door_2 room_4 room_2). Now, in front of blue_door_2. The constraint is satisfied because they were holding purple_ball_1 in a prior state (step 9-12).

Then, drop purple_ball_1 in room_4:

Step 14: drop purple_ball_1 room_4 (requires being in front of an empty position. So perhaps before dropping, they need to gotoempty.

Wait, to drop, you must be in front of an empty position.

So step 13: after being in front of blue_door_2, the agent needs to gotoempty in room_4.

Step 14: gotoempty.

Step 15: drop purple_ball_1 room_4.

Now, hands are empty.

Then, need to go back to room_3 via purple_door_1.

Step 16: gotoroom room_4 room_3 purple_door_1.

Now in room_3.

Step 17: goto purple_door_1 (gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_4). Now in front of it, which is unlocked. This satisfies the goal.

But also, need to handle the constraint about being in front of yellow_box_1 while holding something.

So after dropping purple_ball_1 in room_4, the agent needs to go back to room_1, pick up an object, and go to yellow_box_1.

So steps after step 15:

16. gotoroom room_4 room_3 purple_door_1 (in room_3).

17. gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_1 (since blue_door_1 is unlocked).

18. in room_1, goto red_ball_1.

19. pick red_ball_1.

20. goto yellow_box_1 (now holding red_ball_1, in front of yellow_box_1: satisfies the constraint).

21. drop red_ball_1 somewhere if needed, but not necessary for constraints.

22. then, return to room_3 and purple_door_1.

But this seems lengthy. Let's see if this can be optimized.

Alternative approach:

After step 15 (dropped purple_ball_1 in room_4), the agent needs to go to room_1 to pick up red_ball_1. So:

16. gotoroom room_4 room_3 purple_door_1.

17. gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_1.

18. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_1.

19. pick red_ball_1.

20. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_1 (now holding red_ball_1, in front of yellow_box_1: satisfies the constraint).

21. drop red_ball_1 room_1 (if needed, but not necessary).

22. gotoempty.

23. drop red_ball_1.

Then, need to go back to purple_door_1 in room_3.

24. gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_1.

25. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_4.

Now in front of purple_door_1, which is unlocked. This satisfies the goal.

But this plan is getting quite long. Let's check all constraints:

- In front of blue_door_2: step 13.

- When in front of blue_door_2, previously held purple_ball_1 (step 9-15).

- blue_door_2 remains locked: yes, never toggled.

- In room_4: step 12.

- When entering room_4 (step 12), agent was holding purple_ball_1 (satisfies the prior condition).

- At least once: holding purple_ball_1 (step 9-15) or empty in room_3. Since purple_ball_1 was moved to room_4, room_3 now has green_box_1 and empty spots. So "empty is in room_3" is true, but maybe not needed since the agent held purple_ball_1.

- Holding something and in front of yellow_box_1: step 20.

So all constraints are satisfied.

But the plan needs to be optimal, i.e., as short as possible. Are there any redundant steps?

Let's see:

Original steps up to goal:

1. goto red_door_1 (room_2 to room_1 door)

2. toggle red_door_1 (unlock)

3. gotoroom room_2 to room_1.

4. goto blue_door_1.

5. toggle blue_door_1.

6. gotoroom room_1 to room_3.

7. goto purple_ball_1.

8. pick purple_ball_1.

9. goto purple_door_1.

10. toggle purple_door_1 (now unlocked).

11. gotoroom room_3 to room_4 (now in room_4).

12. goto blue_door_2 (room_4 side).

13. gotoempty.

14. drop purple_ball_1.

15. gotoroom room_4 to room_3.

16. gotoroom room_3 to room_1.

17. goto red_ball_1.

18. pick red_ball_1.

19. goto yellow_box_1.

20. gotoroom room_1 to room_3.

21. goto purple_door_1.

That's a lot of steps. Maybe there's a shorter path.

Alternative idea: After unlocking purple_door_1 and toggling it, the agent is in front of it (step 10). Then, they can immediately satisfy the goal by just staying there. But they need to have visited room_4. So maybe they first go to room_4, then come back.

But perhaps the shortest path is:

- Unlock red_door_1, go to room_1.

- Unlock blue_door_1, go to room_3.

- Pick up purple_ball_1.

- Unlock purple_door_1.

- Go to room_4 (satisfy room_4 constraint).

- Go back to room_3 via purple_door_1.

- Go to purple_door_1 again (in room_3) to be in front of it.

But also, while in room_4, go to blue_door_2 (satisfy that constraint).

Additionally, handle the yellow_box_1 constraint by going back to room_1, pick up red_ball_1, and go to yellow_box_1.

But this seems necessary. However, can we combine some steps?

Wait, after picking up purple_ball_1 in room_3, the agent can go to purple_door_1, unlock it, then go to room_4 (satisfy being in room_4), then go to blue_door_2 in room_4 (satisfy being in front of it, with prior holding of purple_ball_1). Then, drop purple_ball_1 in room_4, go back to room_3, and be in front of purple_door_1. Then, go back to room_1 via blue_door_1, pick up red_ball_1, go to yellow_box_1 while holding it. Then return to purple_door_1.

But this requires many steps. Let's count:

1. goto red_door_1 (room_2 to room_1)

2. toggle red_door_1

3. gotoroom room_2 to room_1

4. goto blue_door_1 (room_1 to room_3)

5. toggle blue_door_1

6. gotoroom room_1 to room_3

7. goto purple_ball_1

8. pick purple_ball_1

9. goto purple_door_1

10. toggle purple_door_1

11. gotoroom room_3 to room_4 (now in room_4)

12. goto blue_door_2 (room_4 to room_2 door)

13. gotoempty

14. drop purple_ball_1

15. gotoroom room_4 to room_3

16. goto purple_door_1 (now in front of it, unlocked. This is the goal.)

Wait, but step 16 is goto purple_door_1, which would be in room_3. So the final state is in front of purple_door_1, unlocked. That meets the goal. But what about the yellow_box_1 constraint?

Ah, right, we need to also satisfy the constraint where the agent is holding something and in front of yellow_box_1. So after step 14 (drop purple_ball_1), the agent needs to go back to room_1, pick up another object (like red_ball_1), and go to yellow_box_1.

But this adds steps:

17. gotoroom room_3 to room_1 via blue_door_1

18. goto red_ball_1

19. pick red_ball_1

20. goto yellow_box_1

Now, in front of yellow_box_1 while holding red_ball_1. Then drop it:

21. gotoempty

22. drop red_ball_1

But then need to go back to purple_door_1 to achieve the goal.

23. gotoroom room_1 to room_3 via blue_door_1

24. goto purple_door_1

Now, in front of it, unlocked. So steps 1-24. But this is very long. Is there a way to optimize?

Alternative idea: While in room_1 after unlocking blue_door_1, pick up red_ball_1 before going to room_3. Then carry it to room_3, then to room_4, etc. But then, when in room_4, the agent can go to blue_door_2 while holding red_ball_1. Then, when returning to room_1, they can drop it and pick up yellow_box_1.

Wait, let's see:

1. goto red_door_1

2. toggle

3. gotoroom to room_1

4. goto red_ball_1

5. pick red_ball_1

6. goto blue_door_1

7. toggle blue_door_1

8. gotoroom to room_3 (now holding red_ball_1)

9. goto purple_ball_1 (but can't pick it up because already holding red_ball_1)

Wait, no. The agent is holding red_ball_1, so can't pick up purple_ball_1. But the constraint requires being in front of blue_door_2 while having held purple_ball_1. So this approach won't work because the agent needs to have held purple_ball_1 before being in front of blue_door_2.

So this suggests that the agent must pick up purple_ball_1 before going to blue_door_2.

Thus, the initial plan is necessary.

But maybe combining steps when possible.

Another observation: The constraint about being in room_4 requires that before entering room_4, the agent was holding something or red_ball_1 is there. Since the agent is carrying purple_ball_1 when entering room_4, this is satisfied.

Now, to handle the yellow_box_1 constraint:

After dropping purple_ball_1 in room_4, the agent can go back to room_3, then to room_1, pick up red_ball_1, go to yellow_box_1, then return to room_3 and purple_door_1.

But how many steps does that add?

Alternatively, maybe after unlocking purple_door_1 and being in front of it (step 10), the agent can go to room_4, do the necessary steps, then return to purple_door_1.

But the goal requires the final state to be in front of the unlocked purple_door_1. So the agent must end there.

Putting it all together, the optimal plan is likely:

1. gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_1

2. toggle red_door_1

3. gotoroom room_2 room_1 red_door_1

4. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_3

5. toggle blue_door_1

6. gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_1

7. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_3

8. pick purple_ball_1 room_3

9. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_4

10. toggle purple_door_1

11. gotoroom room_3 room_4 purple_door_1

12. gotodoor blue_door_2 room_4 room_2

13. gotoempty room_4

14. drop purple_ball_1 room_4

15. gotoroom room_4 room_3 purple_door_1

16. gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_1

17. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_1

18. pick red_ball_1 room_1

19. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_1

20. gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_1

21. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_4

But step 21 is needed to be in front of the purple door again. But after step 21, the agent is in front of purple_door_1, which is unlocked. This meets the goal.

But wait, after step 20, the agent is in room_3. So step 21 would be:

21. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_4

Now, in front of purple_door_1, which is unlocked. So this is the final step.

Thus, the plan has 21 steps. But maybe some steps can be skipped. For example, after step 18 (picking red_ball_1), the agent can go directly to yellow_box_1 (step 19) while holding it, satisfying the constraint. Then, they can drop it and proceed.

But in step 19, just being in front of yellow_box_1 while holding red_ball_1 satisfies the constraint. So steps 19 and 20 are necessary.

But this seems very long. However, considering the constraints, it's unavoidable.

Alternative optimization: After step 14 (drop purple_ball_1), the agent is in room_4. They need to go to room_1 to pick up red_ball_1. But room_4 is connected to room_2 via blue_door_2 (locked), and room_3 via purple_door_1. So the agent must go back through purple_door_1 to room_3, then to room_1 via blue_door_1.

This seems necessary.

Thus, the optimal plan must include all these steps. However, perhaps there's a shorter path.

Wait, maybe after step 8 (holding purple_ball_1), the agent can go to purple_door_1, unlock it, then go to room_4, but before that, go to blue_door_2 in room_4. Let's see:

After step 10 (toggle purple_door_1), agent is in front of it.

Step 11: gotoroom to room_4.

Step 12: gotodoor blue_door_2 in room_4 (satisfies constraint).

Step 13: gotoempty and drop purple_ball_1.

Step 14: go back to room_3.

Step 15: go to room_1 via blue_door_1.

Step 16: pick red_ball_1.

Step 17: goto yellow_box_1.

Step 18: go back to room_3 and purple_door_1.

This would be shorter. Let's count:

1. gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_1

2. toggle red_door_1

3. gotoroom room_2 room_1 red_door_1

4. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_3

5. toggle blue_door_1

6. gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_1

7. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_3

8. pick purple_ball_1 room_3

9. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_4

10. toggle purple_door_1

11. gotoroom room_3 room_4 purple_door_1

12. gotodoor blue_door_2 room_4 room_2

13. gotoempty room_4

14. drop purple_ball_1 room_4

15. gotoroom room_4 room_3 purple_door_1

16. gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_1

17. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_1

18. pick red_ball_1 room_1

19. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_1

20. gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_1

21. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_4

Total of 21 steps. However, perhaps some steps can be merged. For example, after step 14, the agent can go directly to room_1 via room_3 and blue_door_1.

Alternatively, after step 15 (back in room_3), goto blue_door_1, go to room_1, pick up red_ball_1, go to yellow_box_1, then return.

But it's still 21 steps. Is there a way to shorten this?

Wait, the constraint for the yellow_box_1 requires that at some point, the agent is holding something and in front of it. So maybe the agent can do this earlier in the plan, before going to room_3.

For example:

After step 3 (in room_1), the agent can pick up red_ball_1, then go to yellow_box_1 while holding it, then drop it and proceed to unlock doors.

But this would require:

After step 3 (in room_1):

4. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_1

5. pick red_ball_1 room_1

6. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_1

7. drop red_ball_1 room_1 (but why drop? Just need to be holding it and in front of yellow_box_1. So step 6 would suffice.

Then proceed to unlock blue_door_1, etc.

This way, the yellow_box_1 constraint is handled early.

Then, the steps would be:

1. gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_1

2. toggle red_door_1

3. gotoroom room_2 room_1 red_door_1

4. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_1

5. pick red_ball_1 room_1

6. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_1 (now holding red_ball_1, in front of yellow_box_1: constraint met)

7. gotoempty room_1

8. drop red_ball_1 room_1

9. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_3

10. toggle blue_door_1

11. gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_1

12. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_3

13. pick purple_ball_1 room_3

14. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_4

15. toggle purple_door_1

16. gotoroom room_3 room_4 purple_door_1

17. gotodoor blue_door_2 room_4 room_2

18. gotoempty room_4

19. drop purple_ball_1 room_4

20. gotoroom room_4 room_3 purple_door_1

21. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_4

Now, the agent is in front of purple_door_1, unlocked. The steps are 21. But by handling the yellow_box_1 constraint earlier, perhaps it's more efficient.

But does this satisfy all constraints?

- The "in front of blue_door_2" (step 17) after having held purple_ball_1 (steps 13-19).

- room_4 visited (step 16).

- blue_door_2 remains locked.

- The purple_ball_1 is handled, so the "purple_ball_1 held or empty in room_3" is satisfied.

- yellow_box_1 handled in step 6.

Thus, this plan is shorter (21 steps) but more optimal? Or is there a way to make it even shorter?

Alternatively, after step 6 (holding red_ball_1 in front of yellow_box_1), the agent can drop it and proceed. But then they need to pick up purple_ball_1 later.

But perhaps this is more optimal.

But steps 1-21 is still the same length. So perhaps this is the minimal steps required.

But maybe some steps can be skipped. For example, after step 6, the agent can go directly to blue_door_1 without dropping red_ball_1. But since they need to unlock blue_door_1, which requires being in front of it. So:

After step 6, the agent is holding red_ball_1 and in front of yellow_box_1. Then:

7. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_3 (requires being in room_1, which they are).

8. toggle blue_door_1.

9. gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_1 (now in room_3, holding red_ball_1).

10. drop red_ball_1 in room_3 (need to gotoempty first).

11. gotoempty.

12. drop red_ball_1.

13. gotoobject purple_ball_1.

14. pick purple_ball_1.

And so on. But this adds more steps.

Thus, the earlier approach of handling the yellow_box_1 constraint after dropping purple_ball_1 in room_4 might be better.

But regardless, the optimal plan likely requires around 20 steps. However, perhaps there's a smarter way.

Wait, after unlocking purple_door_1 and being in front of it (step 10 in the initial plan), the agent is already in front of the unlocked purple door. So that meets the goal. But the agent also needs to have visited room_4 and met the other constraints.

Ah, here's the problem: the final goal requires the agent to be in front of the purple door, but the agent also needs to have visited room_4. So the agent must first visit room_4 and then return to room_3 to be in front of the purple door again.

Thus, the minimal steps would be:

- Unlock red_door_1, go to room_1.

- Unlock blue_door_1, go to room_3.

- Pick up purple_ball_1.

- Unlock purple_door_1.

- Go to room_4 (satisfy room_4 visit).

- Go back to room_3.

- Be in front of purple_door_1.

Additionally, handle blue_door_2 and yellow_box_1 constraints.

But how to minimize steps:

Perhaps:

1. goto red_door_1 room_2 room_1

2. toggle red_door_1

3. goto room_1

4. goto blue_door_1 room_1 room_3

5. toggle blue_door_1

6. goto room_3

7. pick purple_ball_1

8. goto purple_door_1

9. toggle purple_door_1

10. goto room_4

11. goto blue_door_2 room_4 room_2

12. drop purple_ball_1 (requires gotoempty first)

13. goto room_3

14. goto purple_door_1 (now in front of it, unlocked)

But this is 14 steps, but missing the yellow_box_1 constraint.

Ah, right, need to handle that.

So after step 3 (in room_1):

4. goto red_ball_1

5. pick red_ball_1

6. goto yellow_box_1 (now holding red_ball_1, in front of yellow_box_1: constraint met)

7. drop red_ball_1

8. goto blue_door_1

9. toggle blue_door_1

10. goto room_3

11. pick purple_ball_1

12. goto purple_door_1

13. toggle

14. goto room_4

15. goto blue_door_2

16. gotoempty

17. drop purple_ball_1

18. goto room_3

19. goto purple_door_1

Now, this plan has 19 steps. Let's check if all constraints are met:

- In front of blue_door_2 (step 15): yes, and previously held purple_ball_1 (step 11-17).

- room_4 visited (step 14).

- yellow_box_1 constraint met (step 6).

- purple_ball_1 held (step 11-17), so the other constraint is met.

- blue_door_2 always locked: yes.

Thus, this plan has 19 steps, which is better.

But can we optimize further?

After step 6: in front of yellow_box_1 holding red_ball_1, then drop it (step 7), then proceed.

But maybe instead of dropping, the agent can keep holding red_ball_1 and use it to satisfy the room_4 entry condition.

Wait, when entering room_4 (step 14), the agent is holding purple_ball_1, which satisfies the constraint. So holding red_ball_1 is not needed for that.

But if the agent drops red_ball_1 in room_1, then they are free to pick up purple_ball_1.

Yes, so this plan works.

Thus, the optimal plan would be:

```
gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_1
toggle red_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_1 red_door_1
gotoobject red_ball_1 room_1
pick red_ball_1 room_1
gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_1
drop red_ball_1 room_1
gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_3
toggle blue_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_1
gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_3
pick purple_ball_1 room_3
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_4
toggle purple_door_1
gotoroom room_3 room_4 purple_door_1
gotodoor blue_door_2 room_4 room_2
gotoempty room_4
drop purple_ball_1 room_4
gotoroom room_4 room_3 purple_door_1
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_4
```

Wait, but after step 17 (gotoroom room_4 room_3 purple_door_1), the agent is in room_3. Then step 18 is gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_4, which puts them in front of it, now unlocked.

This plan has 18 steps.

Checking constraints:

- In front of blue_door_2 (step 15): yes, and previously held purple_ball_1 (steps 11-16).

- room_4 visited (step 14).

- yellow_box_1 handled in step 6.

- purple_ball_1 held (steps 11-16).

- blue_door_2 remains locked.

- When entering room_4 (step 14), the agent was holding purple_ball_1 (steps 11-14), satisfying the prior condition.

- The "empty is in room_3" or holding purple_ball_1: after dropping purple_ball_1 in room_4, room_3 has green_box_1 and empty spots. So "empty is in room_3" is true. But the agent also held purple_ball_1, so either condition is met.

Thus, this plan of 18 steps seems to satisfy all constraints and the goal.
