Okay, let's tackle this planning problem step by step. The goal is to find a sequence of actions that meets the final goal and all constraints. First, I need to understand the initial state, the goal, and the constraints.

The initial state is that the agent is in room_4, not holding anything. All doors are locked. The doors are yellow_door_1 (connecting room_1 and room_2), green_door_1 (room_1 and room_3), blue_door_1 (room_2 and room_4), and blue_door_2 (room_3 and room_4). The objects are distributed as follows: yellow_ball_1, yellow_box_1, grey_box_1, and blue_box_1 are in room_1. Purple_ball_1, yellow_box_2, blue_box_2 are in room_2. Purple_ball_2 is in room_4.

The final goal is that there exists a green door (which must be green_door_1) that the agent is in front of, and it's unlocked. So we need to get to green_door_1, unlock it, and ensure it's not locked in the end.

Constraints are quite a few. Let's list them:

1. Must be in room_4 at least once.
2. If in room_4 in some state, then must be in room_1 at that state or later.
3. Yellow_box_1 must be in room_3 at some state.
4. blue_door_2 must be unlocked at some state.
5. If blue_door_2 is unlocked in a state, then in that state or later, the agent is in room_4 or in front of yellow_box_1.
6. blue_door_2 must be locked at some state.
7. If blue_door_2 is locked in a state, then the agent is holding yellow_ball_1 or grey_box_1 is in room_2 in that state or later.
8. green_door_1 must be unlocked at some state.
9. If green_door_1 is unlocked in a state, then in an earlier state, the agent was in room_2 or holding some object.

Let's start by outlining the steps needed to achieve the main goal: unlock green_door_1 and be in front of it. But green_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3. To toggle it (unlock), the agent needs to be in front of it. So the agent must be in either room_1 or room_3. Since the agent starts in room_4, they need to navigate through rooms.

But all doors are initially locked. So the agent needs to unlock doors to move. Let's see the connections. From room_4, blue_door_1 connects to room_2, and blue_door_2 connects to room_3. Both are locked. So to get out of room_4, the agent needs to unlock either blue_door_1 or blue_door_2. But to unlock a door, they need to be in front of it. So first, the agent must go to the door in their current room, toggle it to unlock, then go through.

Wait, the agent is in room_4. To get to room_3, they can use blue_door_2. But blue_door_2 is locked. So the steps would be:

1. gotoempty (to move to an empty spot in room_4)
2. gotodoor blue_door_2 room_4 room_3 (but the door is in room_4 connected to room_3. Wait, the doors are in both rooms. So in room_4, the agent can go to blue_door_2, but need to check if any object is blocking it. According to initial state, purple_ball_2 is in room_4. So if the position in front of blue_door_2 in room_4 is blocked by an object, then the agent can't go there. But the problem statement mentions that the "position in front of d in the room you are currently in" must not be blocked. Wait, the initial state doesn't mention any objects blocking doors. So maybe the doors are not blocked. So the agent can go to the door.

Wait, the initial state says "you have visited room_4" but doesn't mention any objects blocking doors. So perhaps the agent can go to the door. So the steps would be:

In room_4:

- gotodoor blue_door_2 room_4 room_3 (preconditions: in a room connected via blue_door_2, which is room_4, and no object is blocking. Since purple_ball_2 is in room_4, but unless it's in front of the door, which isn't specified. The problem may assume that doors are not blocked unless stated otherwise. So proceed.

Then toggle blue_door_2 to unlock it. Then gotoroom room_4 room_3 blue_door_2. Now in room_3. Then from room_3, can go to room_1 via green_door_1. But green_door_1 is locked. So need to unlock that. But green_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3. To unlock it, the agent needs to be in front of it. But the agent is in room_3, so can go to green_door_1 in room_3, toggle it to unlock, then go to room_1.

But the goal is to have green_door_1 unlocked and be in front of it. So perhaps after unlocking it, the agent is in front of it. Wait, after toggling, the door is unlocked. Then the agent is in front of it. So if the agent is in room_3, goes to green_door_1, toggles it, then that would satisfy the goal (assuming green_door_1 is green, which it is). But the goal requires that the agent is in front of d (green_door_1), d is green, and d is not locked. So the final state would be that the agent is in front of green_door_1 (in room_3 or room_1?), and green_door_1 is unlocked.

But the agent can only be in front of a door if they are in one of the rooms connected by the door. So if they are in room_3 and go to green_door_1 (connecting room_3 and room_1), then they are in front of it in room_3. Then after toggling, the door is unlocked. So that would satisfy the goal.

But let's map out the steps:

1. Agent starts in room_4.

First constraint: must be in room_4 at least once. That's already satisfied in the initial state. Also, the second constraint: if in room_4, then in room_1 at s or later. So after leaving room_4, the agent must eventually get to room_1.

So the plan must include going to room_1 at some point after being in room_4.

Now, the third constraint: yellow_box_1 must be in room_3 at some state. So we need to move yellow_box_1 from room_1 to room_3. To do that, the agent must pick it up in room_1 and drop it in room_3. But to pick it up, the agent must be in room_1, not holding anything. So steps would involve getting to room_1, picking up yellow_box_1, moving to room_3, dropping it.

But getting to room_1 from room_4 requires moving through other rooms. Let's see possible paths:

Option 1: room_4 -> room_3 via blue_door_2 (if unlocked), then room_3 -> room_1 via green_door_1 (needs to unlock green_door_1).

Option 2: room_4 -> room_2 via blue_door_1 (unlock blue_door_1?), then room_2 -> room_1 via yellow_door_1 (unlock yellow_door_1?), then room_1 -> room_3 via green_door_1.

But unlocking doors requires being in front of them. Let's see which doors are possible to unlock first.

Starting in room_4, the doors available are blue_door_1 (connects to room_2) and blue_door_2 (connects to room_3). Both are locked. So the agent needs to unlock one of them to exit room_4.

Let's choose blue_door_2 first. So steps:

1. gotoempty (to be in front of empty spot, but maybe not needed. Wait, the agent is in room_4. To go to a door, the agent can use gotodoor. So first action: gotodoor blue_door_2 room_4 room_3. Then toggle it to unlock. Then gotoroom room_4 room_3 blue_door_2. Now in room_3.

Now in room_3. From room_3, the doors are green_door_1 (connecting to room_1) and blue_door_2 (connecting to room_4). But green_door_1 is locked. So need to unlock it. So:

2. gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_1. Then toggle green_door_1 (unlocks it). Now green_door_1 is unlocked. Then gotoroom room_3 room_1 green_door_1. Now in room_1.

But wait, the agent needs to be in room_1 to pick up yellow_box_1. So once in room_1, the agent can gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_1, pick it up, then carry it to room_3.

But let's check constraints. The third constraint requires that yellow_box_1 is in room_3 at some state. So after dropping it there, that's satisfied.

But also, the constraint that if blue_door_2 is unlocked in some state, then the agent must be in room_4 or in front of yellow_box_1 in that state or later. So when the agent unlocks blue_door_2 (step 1), that's a state where blue_door_2 becomes unlocked. So after that, the agent needs to be in room_4 or in front of yellow_box_1 at some point. But after unlocking blue_door_2, the agent is in room_4 (since they toggled it while in room_4). Wait, no. Wait, the agent was in room_4 when they did gotodoor blue_door_2 room_4 room_3. Then they toggled it (unlocking), then they used gotoroom to go to room_3. So the state where blue_door_2 is unlocked is after the toggle action. At that point, the agent is still in room_4, because gotodoor and toggle don't move them. Wait, no: gotodoor blue_door_2 room_4 room_3 moves them in front of the door in room_4. Then toggle is done while in front of the door in room_4. Then gotoroom moves them to room_3. So the state after toggle is that the agent is in front of blue_door_2 in room_4, and blue_door_2 is unlocked. Then they move to room_3.

So the state where blue_door_2 is unlocked (satisfying constraint 4) is after the toggle. Then, after that, the agent goes to room_3, then to room_1. To satisfy constraint 5, after blue_door_2 is unlocked, the agent must be in room_4 or in front of yellow_box_1. But after unlocking blue_door_2, the agent moves to room_3, then room_1. So they are not in room_4 anymore. So they need to be in front of yellow_box_1 at some point after. Which they will be when they go to pick it up in room_1.

So that's okay.

Now, moving on. The agent is in room_1 after using green_door_1. Then:

3. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_1.

4. pick yellow_box_1 room_1.

5. Now, need to drop it in room_3. So go back through green_door_1 (which is now unlocked).

6. gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3.

7. gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1.

8. Now in room_3. drop yellow_box_1 room_3.

Now, constraint 3 is satisfied (yellow_box_1 is in room_3).

Now, the agent needs to satisfy constraint 8: green_door_1 must be unlocked. That's already done when we toggled it earlier. But also, the constraint 9 says that if green_door_1 is unlocked in some state, then in an earlier state, the agent was in room_2 or holding some object. When the agent toggled green_door_1 (unlocking it), the state after that is green_door_1 unlocked. The earlier state before that would be when the agent was in room_3, having come from room_4 via blue_door_2. But to satisfy constraint 9, before unlocking green_door_1, the agent must have been in room_2 or holding an object. Wait, in our current plan, before unlocking green_door_1, the agent was in room_3, not room_2, and wasn't holding any object yet. So that violates constraint 9. Because when green_door_1 is unlocked (after the toggle), the agent must have been in room_2 or holding an object in a previous state. But in our current steps, before unlocking green_door_1, the agent was in room_3, came from room_4, and wasn't holding anything. So this would not satisfy constraint 9.

So this is a problem. Therefore, the current plan is invalid. Need to adjust.

So how to satisfy constraint 9: before unlocking green_door_1, the agent must have been in room_2 or holding an object in some previous state.

So, options: Either the agent visits room_2 before unlocking green_door_1, or holds an object before unlocking green_door_1.

But in the current plan, the agent goes from room_4 to room_3, unlocks green_door_1. So to satisfy constraint 9, the agent must have either been in room_2 before or held an object before.

So perhaps, the agent needs to go to room_2 first. But how? To get to room_2, the agent is in room_4. The door to room_2 is blue_door_1. So maybe the agent needs to unlock blue_door_1 first.

So alternative plan:

1. In room_4, go to blue_door_1 (connecting to room_2). But is there an object blocking? The initial state in room_4 has purple_ball_2. But unless it's in front of the door, which isn't specified, so assume not blocked.

So:

1. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_4 room_2.

2. toggle blue_door_1 (unlocks it).

3. gotoroom room_4 room_2 blue_door_1. Now in room_2.

Now in room_2. Then, go to room_1 via yellow_door_1. But yellow_door_1 is locked. So need to unlock it.

4. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_1.

5. toggle yellow_door_1 (unlocks it).

6. gotoroom room_2 room_1 yellow_door_1. Now in room_1.

But now, to unlock green_door_1, need to go to room_1's door to room_3. But green_door_1 is in room_1 connected to room_3.

7. gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3.

8. toggle green_door_1 (unlocks it).

At this point, green_door_1 is unlocked. Now, constraint 9: before unlocking green_door_1, the agent must have been in room_2 or held an object. In this path, the agent was in room_2 (steps 3-5). So that satisfies constraint 9.

Then, proceed to move yellow_box_1 to room_3:

9. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_1.

10. pick yellow_box_1 room_1.

11. gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3.

12. gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1.

13. drop yellow_box_1 room_3. Now constraint 3 is satisfied.

Now, the goal is to be in front of green_door_1 (which is green and unlocked). The agent is in room_3 after dropping the box. So they can go to green_door_1 in room_3.

14. gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_1.

At this point, the agent is in front of green_door_1 (which is green and unlocked). So the goal is satisfied.

But we need to check all other constraints:

- Constraint 4: blue_door_2 must be unlocked at some state. In this plan, we haven't unlocked blue_door_2. So this constraint isn't met. Therefore, this plan is invalid.

So the previous approach misses constraint 4 and 6. Let's re-examine the constraints:

Constraints 4 and 6: blue_door_2 must be unlocked and locked in some state. So the agent must toggle blue_door_2 at least twice (lock and unlock), but perhaps once if it's initially locked, then unlocked, then locked again. But the initial state is locked, so to have it locked again, it needs to be toggled again.

But constraint 4 requires that blue_door_2 is not locked (i.e., unlocked) in some state, and constraint 6 requires that blue_door_2 is locked in some state. So the agent must toggle blue_door_2 at least twice: unlock it once (to satisfy 4), then lock it again (to satisfy 6). Or, the agent unlocks it once (satisfies 4) and leaves it unlocked, and then locks it again (satisfies 6). But the initial state is locked. So to have it locked again, the agent must unlock and then lock it again.

But let's see. For constraint 4: blue_door_2 is not locked (unlocked) in some state. So the agent must toggle it to unlocked at least once. For constraint 6: blue_door_2 is locked in some state. The initial state is locked. So if the agent unlocks it (making it unlocked) and then locks it again (back to locked), then constraint 6 is satisfied (since it was locked initially and after locking again). But wait, the constraint requires that in some state, blue_door_2 is locked. The initial state satisfies this. So maybe constraint 6 is already satisfied by the initial state. But the problem states that the constraints must hold in the plan's states, not the initial. Wait, no: the problem says "a valid plan must abide by the following constraints", which includes that "the following expression must hold in at least one state: blue_door_2 is locked". So even if it's locked in the initial state, the plan must have it locked in some state. Since the initial state is part of the plan's execution, then perhaps the initial state counts. But the problem says "a valid plan for the abovementioned problem must abide by the following constraints". So maybe the constraints are about the trajectory of the plan's execution, including the initial state. If the initial state already has blue_door_2 locked, then constraint 6 is satisfied. But constraint 4 requires that in some state (could be after an action) blue_door_2 is unlocked.

Similarly, constraint 8 requires that green_door_1 is not locked in some state. The initial state has it locked, so the agent must unlock it.

But let's check:

In the initial state, blue_door_2 is locked. So constraint 6 is satisfied as long as blue_door_2 is locked in some state, which includes the initial state. So the agent doesn't need to lock it again. But constraint 4 requires that blue_door_2 is unlocked in some state. So the agent must unlock blue_door_2 at least once.

Similarly, constraint 7 says that if blue_door_2 is locked in some state s, then in s or later, the agent is holding yellow_ball_1 or grey_box_1 is in room_2.

In the initial state, blue_door_2 is locked, so s is the initial state. The agent is not holding yellow_ball_1, and grey_box_1 is in room_1. So this violates constraint 7 unless the agent, after the initial state, either picks up yellow_ball_1 or moves grey_box_1 to room_2.

Wait, the constraint says: if blue_door_2 is locked in state s, then in s or some state after s, the agent must be holding yellow_ball_1 or grey_box_1 is in room_2.

In the initial state, blue_door_2 is locked. So the agent must, either in the initial state or later, have one of those conditions. The initial state doesn't satisfy it. So the agent must after the initial state, in some state, either hold yellow_ball_1 or have grey_box_1 in room_2.

But the agent starts in room_4, and grey_box_1 is in room_1. So to move grey_box_1 to room_2, the agent would need to pick it up in room_1 and drop it in room_2. But this requires getting to room_1, which is part of the plan.

Alternatively, the agent could pick up yellow_ball_1, which is in room_1. But to get there, need to navigate through rooms.

So the agent must ensure that after any state where blue_door_2 is locked (including the initial state), either they hold yellow_ball_1 or grey_box_1 is in room_2 at some point.

But in the initial state, since the agent hasn't done anything yet, they must satisfy the consequent after the initial state. So the agent must, at some point after the initial state, either hold yellow_ball_1 or have grey_box_1 in room_2.

So this adds another requirement to the plan.

Let's re-examine the constraints:

Constraint 7: If blue_door_2 is locked in s, then in s or after, agent holds yellow_ball_1 or grey_box_1 is in room_2.

So the initial state is s where blue_door_2 is locked. Therefore, the agent must, in the plan, at some state after the initial state, have either held yellow_ball_1 or moved grey_box_1 to room_2.

This adds another step. Let's see:

If the agent unlocks blue_door_2 (satisfies constraint 4), then perhaps later locks it again (satisfying constraint 6 by having it locked again, but if they do that, then in that state s where it's locked, they need to have the consequent.

But perhaps it's easier to satisfy this by moving grey_box_1 to room_2 or picking up yellow_ball_1.

Let's think about how to incorporate this.

In the previous plan, after unlocking blue_door_1 and yellow_door_1, the agent goes to room_1, unlocks green_door_1, moves yellow_box_1 to room_3. But there's no mention of moving grey_box_1 or holding yellow_ball_1.

So to satisfy constraint 7, after the initial state (where blue_door_2 is locked), the agent must at some point hold yellow_ball_1 or have grey_box_1 in room_2.

So perhaps the agent needs to pick up yellow_ball_1 in room_1 and carry it, or move grey_box_1 to room_2.

But moving grey_box_1 requires picking it up in room_1 and dropping it in room_2.

Let's see. Suppose the agent, after getting to room_1, picks up grey_box_1, takes it to room_2 via yellow_door_1, drops it there. That would satisfy the constraint.

So steps:

After step 6 in the previous plan (agent in room_1):

7. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_1.

8. pick grey_box_1 room_1.

9. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2.

10. gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1.

11. drop grey_box_1 room_2.

Now, grey_box_1 is in room_2, satisfying the consequent of constraint 7 whenever blue_door_2 is locked after this.

But wait, in this scenario, when does blue_door_2 get locked again? If the agent unlocks it once (satisfies constraint 4), and then locks it again, then in that locked state, the agent must have the consequent. But if they don't lock it again, blue_door_2 remains unlocked, but constraint 6 requires that it is locked in some state. The initial state is locked, but if the agent unlocks it, then the only state where it's locked is the initial state. So constraint 6 is satisfied by the initial state. But the problem may require that the plan includes a state where blue_door_2 is locked after some action, but I'm not sure. The problem says "the following expression must hold in at least one state: blue_door_2 is locked". The initial state counts as a state where it's locked, so maybe that's acceptable. Therefore, perhaps we don't need to lock it again. But the agent does need to unlock it once (for constraint 4).

So in this case, unlocking blue_door_2 once (making it unlocked) and leaving it that way would satisfy constraint 4, and the initial state satisfies constraint 6. But constraint 7 requires that whenever blue_door_2 is locked in a state s (which includes the initial state and any state where it's locked again), then the agent must have the consequent. For the initial state s, the agent must have the consequent in s or later. Since in s, the agent hasn't done anything, the consequent must be achieved later. So after the initial state, the agent must at some point hold yellow_ball_1 or have grey_box_1 in room_2.

In the modified plan where the agent moves grey_box_1 to room_2, this is achieved. So that would satisfy constraint 7.

So combining all this, the steps would be:

1. In room_4, goto blue_door_1 (room_4 to room_2).

2. toggle blue_door_1 (unlock).

3. gotoroom room_4 room_2 blue_door_1.

4. In room_2, goto yellow_door_1 (room_2 to room_1).

5. toggle yellow_door_1 (unlock).

6. gotoroom room_2 room_1 yellow_door_1.

7. In room_1, goto grey_box_1.

8. pick grey_box_1.

9. goto yellow_door_1 (room_1 to room_2).

10. gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1.

11. drop grey_box_1 in room_2. Now, grey_box_1 is in room_2, satisfying constraint 7's consequent for the initial state.

12. Now, back to room_1: goto green_door_1.

13. toggle green_door_1 (unlock).

14. gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1.

15. In room_3, need to go to green_door_1 again to be in front of it.

Wait, the goal is to be in front of green_door_1, which is green and unlocked. So after step 13, the agent is in front of green_door_1 in room_1. Then they toggle it (unlock), and then use gotoroom to go to room_3. But after step 14, the agent is in room_3. So to be in front of green_door_1 again, they need to go to it from room_3.

Alternatively, after step 13 (unlocking green_door_1), the agent is in front of green_door_1 in room_1. If they don't move, then the final state would be in front of green_door_1, which is green and unlocked. So that would satisfy the goal.

Wait, after step 13: the agent is in room_1, at green_door_1. They toggle it, which unlocks it. Then they are still in front of green_door_1. So at this point, the goal is satisfied: there's a green door (green_door_1), the agent is in front of it, and it's unlocked.

So perhaps the plan can end here. But let's check the other constraints.

But wait, after step 13, the agent is in front of green_door_1 in room_1. Then they can stay there, and the goal is achieved. But we also need to ensure all other constraints are met.

Let's check:

- Constraint 1: in room_4 at least once. Initial state satisfies this.

- Constraint 2: if in room_4 (which is initially true), then agent must be in room_1 at that state or later. The agent moves to room_1, so that's satisfied.

- Constraint 3: yellow_box_1 in room_3. In this plan, we moved grey_box_1 to room_2, but yellow_box_1 is still in room_1. So this constraint is not met. So this is a problem.

Ah, right, we need to move yellow_box_1 to room_3. So the plan needs to include that.

So adjusting the plan:

After step 11 (grey_box_1 in room_2), the agent is in room_2. They need to get back to room_1 to move yellow_box_1.

12. gotoroom room_2 room_1 yellow_door_1.

13. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_1.

14. pick yellow_box_1 room_1.

15. gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3.

16. toggle green_door_1 (unlock it).

17. gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1.

18. drop yellow_box_1 room_3. Now constraint 3 is satisfied.

19. Now, the agent is in room_3. To be in front of green_door_1 (which is green and unlocked), they can go to the door from room_3.

19. gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_1.

Now, the agent is in front of green_door_1 in room_3. The door is unlocked. So the goal is achieved.

Now, let's check constraints:

- Constraint 4: blue_door_2 must be unlocked in some state. We haven't touched blue_door_2 in this plan. So this constraint is not met. So this plan is invalid.

So we need to unlock blue_door_2 at some point.

So the agent must include steps to unlock blue_door_2. But how?

Let's integrate that into the plan.

Starting again:

The agent needs to unlock blue_door_2 to satisfy constraint 4, and also unlock green_door_1 for the goal. Let's consider a different path.

Option: The agent starts in room_4, unlocks blue_door_2, goes to room_3, then unlocks green_door_1, but to satisfy constraint 9 (when unlocking green_door_1, must have been in room_2 or holding an object before). So in this path, the agent needs to either visit room_2 before or hold an object before unlocking green_door_1.

But in this path, the agent is moving from room_4 to room_3 via blue_door_2 (unlocked), then to room_1 via green_door_1 (unlocked). So after unlocking blue_door_2, the agent is in room_3. To unlock green_door_1, they need to go to it in room_3. But before unlocking green_door_1, they must have been in room_2 or held an object. So in this path, they haven't been to room_2 or held an object, so this violates constraint 9.

Therefore, the agent must either go to room_2 or hold an object before unlocking green_door_1.

So perhaps after unlocking blue_door_2 and going to room_3, the agent picks up an object (e.g., purple_ball_2 in room_4? No, purple_ball_2 is in room_4. Wait, the agent is in room_3. Are there any objects there? In the initial state, room_3 has no objects. So the agent can't pick up anything in room_3. So the only way to hold an object is to go back to room_4, pick up purple_ball_2, then proceed.

But this complicates the plan.

Alternative approach: The agent goes to room_2 via blue_door_1, then to room_1, picks up yellow_ball_1, then moves through doors to room_3, unlocks green_door_1, and drops yellow_ball_1 somewhere.

But this is getting complicated. Let's try to outline a plan that satisfies all constraints.

Let me try to list all constraints and ensure each is met:

1. Be in room_4: initial state.

2. If in room_4 (initial), then be in room_1 later: yes.

3. yellow_box_1 in room_3: need to move it.

4. blue_door_2 unlocked: must be done.

5. If blue_door_2 is unlocked (after action), then agent is in room_4 or in front of yellow_box_1 later.

6. blue_door_2 locked: initial state counts.

7. If blue_door_2 is locked (initial), then agent holds yellow_ball_1 or grey_box_1 in room_2 later.

8. green_door_1 unlocked: must be done.

9. When green_door_1 is unlocked, agent was in room_2 or held an object before.

So steps:

1. Start in room_4.

2. Unlock blue_door_2 (to satisfy constraint 4):

   a. gotodoor blue_door_2 room_4 room_3.

   b. toggle blue_door_2 (unlock).

3. Now, blue_door_2 is unlocked. Constraint 4 is satisfied.

4. For constraint 5: after unlocking blue_door_2, agent must be in room_4 or in front of yellow_box_1. After step 2b, agent is in front of blue_door_2 in room_4. Then they can go to room_3:

   c. gotoroom room_4 room_3 blue_door_2.

5. Now in room_3. To unlock green_door_1, they need to be in front of it:

   d. gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_1.

   e. toggle green_door_1 (unlock).

6. Now, green_door_1 is unlocked (constraint 8). But constraint 9: before this, agent must have been in room_2 or held an object. In this path, they haven't been to room_2 or held an object. So this violates constraint 9.

Thus, need to adjust. So before step d-e (unlocking green_door_1), the agent must have been in room_2 or held an object.

So how? Perhaps the agent goes from room_3 to room_4 via blue_door_2, then to room_2 via blue_door_1.

But blue_door_1 is initially locked. So agent needs to unlock it.

Let's try:

After step 3 (blue_door_2 unlocked), agent is in room_3.

4. gotoroom room_3 room_4 blue_door_2. Back to room_4.

5. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_4 room_2.

6. toggle blue_door_1 (unlock).

7. gotoroom room_4 room_2 blue_door_1. Now in room_2.

8. This satisfies constraint 9, as now the agent has been in room_2 before unlocking green_door_1.

9. Now, go to room_1 via yellow_door_1. Unlock yellow_door_1:

   a. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_1.

   b. toggle yellow_door_1 (unlock).

   c. gotoroom room_2 room_1 yellow_door_1.

10. Now in room_1. Pick up yellow_box_1:

   a. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_1.

   b. pick yellow_box_1.

11. Take it to room_3:

   a. gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3.

   b. toggle green_door_1 (unlock).

   c. gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1.

   d. drop yellow_box_1 room_3. Constraint 3 satisfied.

12. Now, agent is in room_3, in front of green_door_1 after dropping the box. So the goal is achieved.

But need to check all constraints:

- Constraint 4: blue_door_2 unlocked (step 2b).

- Constraint 5: after unlocking blue_door_2, agent went to room_4 (step 4), which satisfies being in room_4 later.

- Constraint 7: initial state blue_door_2 locked, so after that, agent must hold yellow_ball_1 or grey_box_1 in room_2. In this plan, the agent moves grey_box_1 to room_2? No, in this plan, the agent moved yellow_box_1 to room_3. So grey_box_1 is still in room_1. Therefore, constraint 7 is not satisfied. Thus, need to address this.

So agent must either pick up yellow_ball_1 or move grey_box_1 to room_2.

In room_1, grey_box_1 is present. So after step 9c, agent is in room_1. They can pick up grey_box_1 and move it to room_2.

Adjusting steps:

After step 9c (agent in room_1):

10. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_1.

11. pick grey_box_1.

12. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2.

13. gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1.

14. drop grey_box_1 room_2. Now, grey_box_1 is in room_2. This satisfies constraint 7.

15. Now, go back to room_1 to get yellow_box_1:

   a. gotoroom room_2 room_1 yellow_door_1.

   b. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_1.

   c. pick yellow_box_1.

   d. gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3.

   e. toggle green_door_1 (unlock).

   f. gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1.

   g. drop yellow_box_1 room_3.

16. Now, in room_3, need to be in front of green_door_1.

   a. gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_1.

Now, the agent is in front of green_door_1 (green), which is unlocked. Goal achieved.

Now, let's check all constraints:

1. In room_4: initial state and when returning (step 4).

2. After being in room_4, agent is in room_1 later (step 9c).

3. yellow_box_1 in room_3: yes.

4. blue_door_2 unlocked: step 2b.

5. After unlocking blue_door_2 (step 2b), agent goes to room_3, then back to room_4, which satisfies being in room_4 later.

6. blue_door_2 locked in initial state: yes.

7. After initial state (blue_door_2 locked), agent moved grey_box_1 to room_2 (step 14).

8. green_door_1 unlocked: step 15e.

9. When unlocking green_door_1 (step 15e), the agent had been in room_2 (steps 7-9c and 13-14), satisfying constraint 9.

This seems to cover all constraints.

But let's verify step by step.

Constraint 7: Whenever blue_door_2 is locked (initial state), agent must have in that state or later either hold yellow_ball_1 or grey_box_1 in room_2. In this plan, after initial state, grey_box_1 is moved to room_2 (step 14), so constraint 7 is satisfied.

Constraint 5: After unlocking blue_door_2 (step 2b), the agent must be in room_4 or in front of yellow_box_1. After step 2b, agent is in room_4, then goes to room_3, then back to room_4 (step 4), then to room_2. So being in room_4 after unlocking satisfies constraint 5.

Constraint 8: green_door_1 is unlocked (step 15e).

Constraint 9: When green_door_1 is unlocked (step 15e), the agent had been in room_2 earlier (step 7-9c and 13-14).

All other constraints seem satisfied.

Now, let's outline the full plan with all steps:

1. gotodoor blue_door_2 room_4 room_3
2. toggle blue_door_2
3. gotoroom room_4 room_3 blue_door_2
4. gotoroom room_3 room_4 blue_door_2
5. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_4 room_2
6. toggle blue_door_1
7. gotoroom room_4 room_2 blue_door_1
8. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_1
9. toggle yellow_door_1
10. gotoroom room_2 room_1 yellow_door_1
11. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_1
12. pick grey_box_1 room_1
13. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2
14. gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1
15. drop grey_box_1 room_2
16. gotoroom room_2 room_1 yellow_door_1
17. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_1
18. pick yellow_box_1 room_1
19. gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3
20. toggle green_door_1
21. gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1
22. drop yellow_box_1 room_3
23. gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_1

But wait, step 3: after unlocking blue_door_2, agent moves to room_3. Then step 4: gotoroom room_3 room_4 blue_door_2. That brings them back to room_4. Then step 5: gotodoor blue_door_1 (room_4 to room_2), toggle to unlock, then go to room_2.

Yes, this makes sense.

But this plan has a lot of steps. Is there a way to optimize?

For example, after step 3 (in room_3), instead of going back to room_4, maybe the agent can go to room_2 via another path. But the doors are locked initially. So the only way from room_3 is via room_4.

Alternatively, the agent could unlock blue_door_2, go to room_3, then back to room_4, unlock blue_door_1, go to room_2, then proceed.

Yes, that's what the plan does.

But the key is to ensure that all constraints are met, and the plan is optimal (shortest possible).

This plan seems to have 23 steps. Maybe there's a shorter path.

Alternative approach: Unlock blue_door_2 first, then go to room_3, then to room_4, unlock blue_door_1, go to room_2, unlock yellow_door_1, go to room_1, move grey_box_1 to room_2, return to room_1, pick yellow_box_1, unlock green_door_1, drop it in room_3, and finally go to green_door_1.

But let's count steps:

1. gotodoor blue_door_2 room_4 room_3 (1)
2. toggle blue_door_2 (2)
3. gotoroom room_4 room_3 blue_door_2 (3)
4. gotoroom room_3 room_4 blue_door_2 (4)
5. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_4 room_2 (5)
6. toggle blue_door_1 (6)
7. gotoroom room_4 room_2 blue_door_1 (7)
8. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_1 (8)
9. toggle yellow_door_1 (9)
10. gotoroom room_2 room_1 yellow_door_1 (10)
11. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_1 (11)
12. pick grey_box_1 room_1 (12)
13. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2 (13)
14. gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1 (14)
15. drop grey_box_1 room_2 (15)
16. gotoroom room_2 room_1 yellow_door_1 (16)
17. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_1 (17)
18. pick yellow_box_1 room_1 (18)
19. gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3 (19)
20. toggle green_door_1 (20)
21. gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1 (21)
22. drop yellow_box_1 room_3 (22)
23. gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_1 (23)

This is 23 steps. Is there a way to shorten this?

For example, after moving grey_box_1 to room_2 (step 15), maybe the agent can proceed to unlock green_door_1 without returning to room_1 again. But yellow_box_1 is in room_1, so to move it to room_3, the agent needs to pick it up in room_1.

Alternatively, after dropping grey_box_1 in room_2 (step 15), the agent is in room_2. They can go to room_1 via yellow_door_1 (step 16), pick yellow_box_1, then go to green_door_1, unlock it, and drop it in room_3.

This seems necessary.

Another optimization: Maybe combine some steps. For example, after step 15 (drop grey_box_1), the agent is in room_2. They can go directly to room_1 via yellow_door_1 (already unlocked), pick yellow_box_1, then go to green_door_1, unlock it, and drop the box.

Yes, which is what the plan does.

Is there any redundancy? For instance, after step 3 (agent in room_3), then step 4 brings them back to room_4. Is this necessary? Yes, because from room_3, the only way to room_2 is via room_4 (blue_door_1) or via room_1 (green_door_1, which is locked). So to reach room_2, agent must go back to room_4, unlock blue_door_1, then go to room_2.

Thus, the steps are necessary.

Another possible optimization: After step 7 (agent in room_2), they can go to room_1 via yellow_door_1 (unlock it), then move grey_box_1 to room_2, then proceed. But that's similar to the current plan.

I think this is the optimal plan given the constraints. Now, let's format it correctly with actions.
