I need to solve a planning problem in a 2D gridworld with 4 rooms. Let me organize the problem:

# Initial State:
- I am in room_4
- yellow_ball_1, yellow_box_1, grey_box_1, blue_box_1 are in room_1
- purple_ball_1, yellow_box_2, blue_box_2 are in room_2
- purple_ball_2 is in room_4
- All doors (yellow_door_1, green_door_1, blue_door_1, blue_door_2) are locked
- I'm not holding any object
- I have visited room_4

# Goal:
- There is a green door that I am in front of and is unlocked

# Constraints:
1. At some point I must be in room_4 (already satisfied in initial state)
2. If I'm in room_4, then I must eventually go to room_1
3. At some point yellow_box_1 must be in room_3
4. At some point blue_door_2 must be unlocked
5. If blue_door_2 is unlocked, then I must eventually either be in room_4 or in front of yellow_box_1
6. At some point blue_door_2 must be locked
7. If blue_door_2 is locked, then I must eventually either hold yellow_ball_1 or have grey_box_1 in room_2
8. At some point green_door_1 must be unlocked
9. If green_door_1 is unlocked, then there must have been a previous state where I was either in room_2 or holding some object

Looking at the goal, I need to be in front of green_door_1 (the only green door) and it should be unlocked. green_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3.

Let me plan step by step:

1. I start in room_4.
2. I need to get to room_1 to access green_door_1.
3. To move between rooms, I need to unlock doors.
4. blue_door_1 connects room_4 and room_2, I need to unlock it to get to room_2.
5. yellow_door_1 connects room_2 and room_1, I need to unlock it to get to room_1 from room_2.
6. I also need to move yellow_box_1 from room_1 to room_3 (constraint #3).
7. blue_door_2 connects room_4 and room_3, and needs to be both unlocked and locked at different points (constraints #4 and #6).
8. If blue_door_2 is locked, I need to either hold yellow_ball_1 or have grey_box_1 in room_2 (constraint #7).
9. To unlock green_door_1, I need to have previously been in room_2 or holding some object (constraint #9).

Now let's devise a plan:

1. I'm in room_4. First, I'll go to the blue_door_1 and unlock it.
2. I'll go to room_2 through blue_door_1.
3. Now I'm in room_2, which satisfies part of constraint #9.
4. I'll go to yellow_door_1 and unlock it.
5. I'll go to room_1 through yellow_door_1, satisfying constraint #2.
6. In room_1, I'll pick up yellow_box_1.
7. I'll go back to room_2 through yellow_door_1.
8. I'll go to blue_door_1 and go to room_4.
9. In room_4, I'll go to blue_door_2 and unlock it, satisfying constraint #4.
10. I'll go to room_3 through blue_door_2.
11. In room_3, I'll drop yellow_box_1, satisfying constraint #3.
12. I'll go back to room_4 through blue_door_2, satisfying constraint #5.
13. Now I'll lock blue_door_2, satisfying constraint #6.
14. I'll go to room_2 through blue_door_1.
15. In room_2, I'll pick up grey_box_1 and move it to room_2 to satisfy constraint #7. (Actually no, grey_box_1 is in room_1, so I need to get it). 
   - Actually, let me revise this. I need to go to room_1, pick up grey_box_1, and bring it to room_2.
16. I'll go to room_1 through yellow_door_1.
17. I'll pick up grey_box_1 in room_1.
18. I'll go back to room_2 through yellow_door_1 with grey_box_1, satisfying constraint #7.
19. I'll drop grey_box_1 in room_2.
20. I'll go to room_1 through yellow_door_1.
21. I'll go to green_door_1 and unlock it, satisfying constraint #8.
22. Finally, I'll stand in front of green_door_1, satisfying the main goal.

Hmm, let me reconsider my plan. There are some logistical issues:

1. In my plan I'm moving grey_box_1 to room_2, but I see there's an issue - I first need to go to room_1, pick it up, and then bring it to room_2.
2. Also, one constraint says "If blue_door_2 is locked, then I must eventually either hold yellow_ball_1 or have grey_box_1 in room_2", which means after locking blue_door_2, I need to either hold yellow_ball_1 or move grey_box_1 to room_2.

Let me revise the plan:

1. I'm in room_4. Go to blue_door_1 and unlock it.
2. Go to room_2 through blue_door_1.
3. Go to yellow_door_1 and unlock it.
4. Go to room_1 through yellow_door_1.
5. In room_1, pick up grey_box_1.
6. Go back to room_2 through yellow_door_1 with grey_box_1.
7. Drop grey_box_1 in room_2.
8. Go back to room_1 through yellow_door_1.
9. Pick up yellow_box_1 in room_1.
10. Go back to room_2 through yellow_door_1.
11. Go to room_4 through blue_door_1.
12. Go to blue_door_2 and unlock it.
13. Go to room_3 through blue_door_2.
14. Drop yellow_box_1 in room_3.
15. Go back to room_4 through blue_door_2.
16. Lock blue_door_2 (grey_box_1 is already in room_2, satisfying constraint #7).
17. Go to room_1 through room_2 (using blue_door_1 and yellow_door_1).
18. Go to green_door_1 in room_1.
19. Unlock green_door_1 (we've been in room_2 before, satisfying constraint #9).
20. Stand in front of green_door_1, completing the goal.

Wait, this plan doesn't seem right either. Let me check if we can actually stand in front of green_door_1 while in room_1:

- green_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3.
- The action "gotodoor d r1 r2" allows me to go in front of door d, connecting room r1 to room r2.

So I should be able to stand in front of green_door_1 from room_1.

Let me recheck the constraints once more:

1. At some point I must be in room_4 (satisfied at the beginning)
2. If I'm in room_4, I must eventually go to room_1 (satisfied in step 4)
3. At some point yellow_box_1 must be in room_3 (satisfied in step 14)
4. At some point blue_door_2 must be unlocked (satisfied in step 12)
5. If blue_door_2 is unlocked, I must eventually be in room_4 or in front of yellow_box_1 (satisfied in step 15)
6. At some point blue_door_2 must be locked (satisfied in step 16)
7. If blue_door_2 is locked, I must eventually hold yellow_ball_1 or have grey_box_1 in room_2 (satisfied by step 7)
8. At some point green_door_1 must be unlocked (satisfied in step 19)
9. If green_door_1 is unlocked, there must have been a previous state where I was in room_2 or holding an object (satisfied by steps 2-3)

My plan satisfies all constraints. Let me write out the actions in the format required:

1. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_4 room_2
2. toggle blue_door_1
3. gotoroom room_4 room_2 blue_door_1
4. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_1
5. toggle yellow_door_1
6. gotoroom room_2 room_1 yellow_door_1
7. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_1
8. pick grey_box_1 room_1
9. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2
10. gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1
11. gotoempty
12. drop grey_box_1 room_2
13. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_1
14. gotoroom room_2 room_1 yellow_door_1
15. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_1
16. pick yellow_box_1 room_1
17. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2
18. gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1
19. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_4
20. gotoroom room_2 room_4 blue_door_1
21. gotodoor blue_door_2 room_4 room_3
22. toggle blue_door_2
23. gotoroom room_4 room_3 blue_door_2
24. gotoempty
25. drop yellow_box_1 room_3
26. gotodoor blue_door_2 room_3 room_4
27. gotoroom room_3 room_4 blue_door_2
28. gotodoor blue_door_2 room_4 room_3
29. toggle blue_door_2
30. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_4 room_2
31. gotoroom room_4 room_2 blue_door_1
32. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_1
33. gotoroom room_2 room_1 yellow_door_1
34. gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3
35. toggle green_door_1

Ah, I need to make sure I'm standing in front of green_door_1 at the end. So let me review my final step: I've unlocked green_door_1 and I'm standing in front of it, which satisfies the goal. So it looks like my plan is correct.

Let me quickly double-check:
1. I start in room_4, and eventually go to room_1 (constraint 1 & 2)
2. I unlock blue_door_2 and then later lock it (constraints 4 & 6)
3. After unlocking blue_door_2, I go to room_4 (constraint 5)
4. After locking blue_door_2, grey_box_1 is in room_2 (constraint 7)
5. I move yellow_box_1 to room_3 (constraint 3)
6. I unlock green_door_1 after having been in room_2 (constraints 8 & 9)
7. I end standing in front of an unlocked green_door_1 (main goal)

I believe my plan satisfies all constraints and achieves the goal.

Actually, looking at constraint 9 again: "If green_door_1 is unlocked, then there must have been a previous state where I was either in room_2 or holding some object"

I do satisfy this because I was in room_2 earlier in my plan (steps 3-5, 10-12, 18-19, 31-32). I also held objects (grey_box_1 and yellow_box_1).

So my plan is valid and optimal (I don't think there's a shorter path to satisfy all constraints).

Let me just double-check one more time:

1. I need to be in front of green_door_1 and it needs to be unlocked
2. I need to satisfy all 9 constraints

My plan does this, so I'm confident it's correct.

Actually let me double check that I have the right format for the actions:

1. "gotodoor blue_door_1 room_4 room_2": Go in front of blue_door_1 which connects room_4 and room_2.
2. "toggle blue_door_1": Unlock blue_door_1.
3. "gotoroom room_4 room_2 blue_door_1": Go from room_4 to room_2 through blue_door_1.
4. "gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_1": Go in front of yellow_door_1 which connects room_2 and room_1.
5. "toggle yellow_door_1": Unlock yellow_door_1.
6. "gotoroom room_2 room_1 yellow_door_1": Go from room_2 to room_1 through yellow_door_1.
7. "gotoobject grey_box_1 room_1": Go in front of grey_box_1 in room_1.
8. "pick grey_box_1 room_1": Pick up grey_box_1 in room_1.
9. "gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2": Go in front of yellow_door_1 which connects room_1 and room_2.
10. "gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1": Go from room_1 to room_2 through yellow_door_1.
11. "gotoempty": Go in front of an empty position.
12. "drop grey_box_1 room_2": Drop grey_box_1 in room_2.
13. "gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_1": Go in front of yellow_door_1 which connects room_2 and room_1.

15. "gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_1": Go in front of yellow_box_1 in room_1.
16. "pick yellow_box_1 room_1": Pick up yellow_box_1 in room_1.
17. "gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2": Go in front of yellow_door_1 which connects room_1 and room_2.
18. "gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1": Go from room_1 to room_2 through yellow_door_1.
19. "gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_4": Go in front of blue_door_1 which connects room_2 and room_4.
20. "gotoroom room_2 room_4 blue_door_1": Go from room_2 to room_4 through blue_door_1.
21. "gotodoor blue_door_2 room_4 room_3": Go in front of blue_door_2 which connects room_4 and room_3.
22. "toggle blue_door_2": Unlock blue_door_2.
23. "gotoroom room_4 room_3 blue_door_2": Go from room_4 to room_3 through blue_door_2.
24. "gotoempty": Go in front of an empty position.
25. "drop yellow_box_1 room_3": Drop yellow_box_1 in room_3.
26. "gotodoor blue_door_2 room_3 room_4": Go in front of blue_door_2 which connects room_3 and room_4.
27. "gotoroom room_3 room_4 blue_door_2": Go from room_3 to room_4 through blue_door_2.
28. "gotodoor blue_door_2 room_4 room_3": Go in front of blue_door_2 which connects room_4 and room_3.
29. "toggle blue_door_2": Lock blue_door_2.
30. "gotodoor blue_door_1 room_4 room_2": Go in front of blue_door_1 which connects room_4 and room_2.
31. "gotoroom room_4 room_2 blue_door_1": Go from room_4 to room_2 through blue_door_1.
32. "gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_1": Go in front of yellow_door_1 which connects room_2 and room_1.
33. "gotoroom room_2 room_1 yellow_door_1": Go from room_2 to room_1 through yellow_door_1.
34. "gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3": Go in front of green_door_1 which connects room_1 and room_3.
35. "toggle green_door_1": Unlock green_door_1.

This looks correct. My final answer is this plan.

(slight caveat: I'm wondering if my plan is optimal - there might be slightly more efficient ways to satisfy the constraints, but I believe this is a valid and efficient plan)

I need to present my answer in the required format, so let me wrap it up:
