Okay, let's tackle this planning problem step by step. The goal is to have a grey box that the agent is holding. The initial state is that the agent is in room_3, not holding anything. The constraints add some complexity, so I need to make sure each one is satisfied in the plan.

First, the final goal is to have a grey box (v) that the agent is holding. Looking at the objects, the grey boxes are grey_box_1 and grey_box_2, both in room_3 initially. So the agent needs to pick up one of these. But there are constraints to consider.

Let's list the constraints:

1. At least one state where the agent is holding some object.
2. If holding an object in any state, there must be an earlier state where the agent was in front of purple_ball_1.
3. At least one state where grey_box_1 is in room_4.
4. At least one state where the agent is in room_4.
5. At least one state where grey_door_3 is unlocked and the agent is holding yellow_ball_1.
6. At least one state where the agent is in front of purple_ball_2.

So, the plan needs to satisfy all these.

Starting from room_3. The agent needs to pick up a grey box. But to do that, the agent needs to be in front of it. So first, go to the grey box (grey_box_1 or 2) in room_3. But wait, before that, the constraints require that if the agent is holding any object, they must have previously been in front of purple_ball_1. So the first time they pick up something, they must have been in front of purple_ball_1. However, the initial position is room_3, and purple_ball_1 is in room_1. So the agent needs to get to room_1 to be in front of purple_ball_1 before picking up anything.

But all doors are locked initially. So the agent needs to unlock doors to move between rooms. Let's check the doors:

- room_1 is connected to room_2 via grey_door_1 (locked)
- room_1 is connected to room_3 via grey_door_2 (locked)
- room_2 is connected to room_4 via grey_door_3 (locked)
- room_3 is connected to room_4 via red_door_1 (locked)

The agent is in room_3. To get to room_1, they need to go through grey_door_2. But it's locked. So they need to toggle it. To toggle a door, they need to be in front of it. So first, the agent must go to grey_door_2 in room_3, toggle it to unlock.

Wait, but doors are two-way. So in room_3, the door connecting to room_1 is grey_door_2. So the agent can goto door grey_door_2 in room_3 (since they are in room_3, which is connected via grey_door_2 to room_1). Then toggle it to unlock. Then go to room_1 via gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_2.

Once in room_1, they can go to purple_ball_1 (since it's in room_1). Then pick it up. But according to the constraints, before holding any object, they must have been in front of purple_ball_1. But if they pick up purple_ball_1, that's okay because the first holding action is after being in front of it. But perhaps the agent needs to hold another object later, so they need to have been in front of purple_ball_1 before that. But maybe just picking up purple_ball_1 first satisfies that constraint for any subsequent holding actions.

But the goal is to hold a grey box, so after dealing with purple_ball_1, maybe the agent can drop it and then pick up the grey box. But there's another constraint: the agent must be in front of purple_ball_2 (which is in room_3) at some point. Also, the agent must be in room_4 at some point, and grey_box_1 must be in room_4. So the agent has to move grey_box_1 to room_4.

Additionally, there's a constraint that in some state, grey_door_3 is unlocked and the agent is holding yellow_ball_1. Yellow_ball_1 is in room_2. So the agent needs to go to room_2, pick up yellow_ball_1, and have grey_door_3 unlocked at the same time.

Let's outline the steps:

1. Unlock doors to move between rooms. Starting in room_3, unlock grey_door_2 to get to room_1.

But wait, the agent is in room_3. To unlock grey_door_2, they need to go to the door (gotodoor grey_door_2 room_3 room_1), then toggle it. Then use gotoroom to go to room_1.

In room_1, they can go to purple_ball_1, pick it up (satisfying the constraint that when holding something, they were in front of purple_ball_1 before). Then perhaps drop it later.

But also, the agent needs to get to room_4. How? From room_3, after unlocking red_door_1. But red_door_1 connects room_3 and room_4. So if the agent can unlock red_door_1, they can go directly to room_4. But red_door_1 is red and locked. To unlock it, the agent needs to be in front of it. So from room_3, goto door red_door_1 (room_3 and room_4), toggle it. But in room_3, is the door red_door_1 accessible? Yes. So gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_4. Then toggle to unlock. Then go to room_4.

Alternatively, another path: room_3 to room_1 via grey_door_2, then room_1 to room_2 via grey_door_1 (but that's locked), so need to unlock grey_door_1 as well. Then room_2 to room_4 via grey_door_3 (also locked). So multiple doors to unlock.

But the agent needs to get to room_4. Let's consider the quickest way. Unlock red_door_1 from room_3, then go directly to room_4. That seems faster. So steps:

1. In room_3, goto door red_door_1 (room_3, room_4). Since the agent is in room_3, which is connected via red_door_1 to room_4. But the door is locked. So goto door red_door_1 room_3 room_4. Then toggle to unlock. Then gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_1. Now the agent is in room_4. This satisfies the constraint that the agent must be in room_4 at some state.

But also, grey_box_1 needs to be in room_4. Currently, grey_box_1 is in room_3. So the agent must move it. But to do that, the agent needs to pick it up from room_3, carry it to room_4, and drop it there. But to pick it up, the agent must be in room_3 and in front of it. However, after going to room_4, the agent is in room_4. So the agent needs to return to room_3, pick up grey_box_1, and bring it to room_4.

But also, the agent needs to be in front of purple_ball_2 (which is in room_3) at some point. So when the agent is back in room_3, they can goto purple_ball_2.

But there's another constraint: when holding yellow_ball_1, grey_door_3 must be unlocked. Yellow_ball_1 is in room_2. So the agent needs to go to room_2, pick it up, and have grey_door_3 unlocked at that time.

Let's try to outline the steps:

1. Unlock red_door_1 from room_3:
   - gotoempty (since in room_3, maybe there's an empty spot)
   - gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_4
   - toggle red_door_1 (unlocks it)
   - gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_1 (now in room_4)
   This satisfies the "you are in room_4" constraint.

But then need to go back to room_3 to handle grey_box_1 and purple_ball_2.

But perhaps a better path is to first unlock doors that allow movement to multiple rooms. Let's see:

From room_3, unlock grey_door_2 (connecting to room_1), then go to room_1. Then unlock grey_door_1 (connecting to room_2) by going to it in room_1, toggle it. Then go to room_2, unlock grey_door_3 (connecting to room_4). Then go to room_4 via grey_door_3. But this might take more steps.

But given time constraints, maybe the fastest way is to unlock red_door_1 first, allowing access to room_4. But then how to get to room_1 and room_2.

Alternatively, perhaps the optimal path requires unlocking multiple doors.

But let's think step by step.

The agent's initial position is room_3. They need to:

- Be in front of purple_ball_1 (room_1) before picking any object.
- Be in front of purple_ball_2 (room_3).
- Have grey_box_1 in room_4.
- Be in room_4.
- Have grey_door_3 unlocked while holding yellow_ball_1 (room_2).

So the agent needs to go to room_1, room_2, and room_4.

Let's plan:

First, go to room_1 to be in front of purple_ball_1. To do that, unlock grey_door_2 (connecting room_3 and room_1). The agent is in room_3.

So steps:

1. In room_3, goto door grey_door_2 (room_3, room_1). But wait, the doors are two-way. The gotodoor action requires that the agent is in a room connected by the door. So in room_3, the door grey_door_2 connects to room_1. So:

Action: gotodoor grey_door_2 room_3 room_1. Preconditions: in room_3, no object blocking the door's position. Since the initial state doesn't mention any objects blocking doors, assuming it's possible.

Then toggle grey_door_2 to unlock it.

Then go to room_1 via gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_2.

Now in room_1. Then gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_1. Then pick purple_ball_1 room_1. This satisfies the constraint that when holding an object, they were in front of purple_ball_1 before.

But the agent is now holding purple_ball_1. Then they need to drop it somewhere, perhaps, to pick up another object (like yellow_ball_1 or the grey box). But the goal is to hold a grey box. So maybe after this, the agent can drop purple_ball_1, but perhaps not necessary yet.

Alternatively, they can carry purple_ball_1 to room_3, but then need to drop it to pick up the grey box.

But the agent also needs to be in front of purple_ball_2 (in room_3). So when back in room_3, they can gotoobject purple_ball_2.

But let's continue.

After picking purple_ball_1, the agent is holding it. Now, to satisfy the constraint that grey_door_3 is unlocked and holding yellow_ball_1, the agent needs to get yellow_ball_1 (in room_2) and unlock grey_door_3 (connecting room_2 and room_4). To get to room_2, from room_1, need to unlock grey_door_1 (connecting room_1 and room_2). So:

From room_1, goto door grey_door_1 (room_1, room_2). Toggle to unlock. Then go to room_2 via gotoroom room_1 room_2 grey_door_1.

In room_2, gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2. Then pick yellow_ball_1 room_2. But wait, the agent is already holding purple_ball_1. So can't pick another object. So they need to drop purple_ball_1 first.

So steps:

After picking purple_ball_1 in room_1:

- gotoempty (to drop)
- drop purple_ball_1 room_1 (but need to be in front of empty spot. So first gotoempty, then drop. Wait, the drop action requires that the agent is holding x and the position in front is empty. But after gotoempty, the agent is in front of empty. So:

Action sequence:

After picking purple_ball_1:

gotoempty room_1 (or just drop wherever, but need to be in front of empty. So maybe after picking, the agent is in front of purple_ball_1's previous position. But after picking, the agent is no longer in front of it. So need to gotoempty, then drop.

But maybe after picking, the agent is not in front of anything. Hmm, the effect of pick is that you are no longer in front of x. So after picking, the agent is just in the room, not in front of any object. So to drop, they need to be in front of an empty position.

So:

gotoempty (in room_1)
drop purple_ball_1 room_1

Now, agent is empty again.

Then, go to room_2:

From room_1, unlock grey_door_1 (connecting to room_2). The agent needs to goto door grey_door_1 in room_1, toggle it to unlock. Then gotoroom room_1 room_2 grey_door_1.

Now in room_2. Gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2. Pick it up. Now holding yellow_ball_1.

At this point, the agent needs to have grey_door_3 unlocked while holding yellow_ball_1. Grey_door_3 connects room_2 and room_4. So, while in room_2, the agent can goto door grey_door_3 (room_2, room_4), then toggle it. But since it's initially locked, toggling it would unlock. Then, the agent is holding yellow_ball_1 and grey_door_3 is unlocked. This satisfies the constraint.

So steps after picking yellow_ball_1:

gotodoor grey_door_3 room_2 room_4 (agent is in room_2)
toggle grey_door_3 (unlocks it)
Now, the agent is holding yellow_ball_1 and grey_door_3 is unlocked. So this state meets the constraint.

Then, the agent can go to room_4 via grey_door_3. But first, need to be in front of the door. After toggling, the agent is in front of grey_door_3. So:

gotoroom room_2 room_4 grey_door_3 (now in room_4). This also satisfies the "be in room_4" constraint.

But we also need to move grey_box_1 to room_4. Currently, grey_box_1 is in room_3. The agent is in room_4. To move grey_box_1, the agent needs to go back to room_3, pick it up, and bring it to room_4.

So:

From room_4, need to return to room_3. But how? The red_door_1 connects room_3 and room_4, but it's locked. Wait, earlier step: the agent was in room_3 and unlocked red_door_1? Wait, no. In the initial steps, the agent may have not unlocked red_door_1 yet. Let's see.

Wait, in the previous steps, the agent went from room_3 to room_1 via grey_door_2, then to room_2 via grey_door_1, then to room_4 via grey_door_3. So to get back to room_3 from room_4, perhaps via red_door_1. But red_door_1 is locked initially. The agent hasn't unlocked it yet. So they need to unlock red_door_1.

But the agent is in room_4. The red_door_1 connects room_4 to room_3. So in room_4, the agent can goto door red_door_1 (room_4, room_3). Then toggle it to unlock. Then go to room_3.

But currently, the agent is holding yellow_ball_1. So to unlock red_door_1, they need to be in front of it. So:

From room_4:

gotoempty (drop yellow_ball_1, but that would mean dropping it in room_4. Alternatively, hold onto it until they can use it.)

But to unlock red_door_1, the agent needs to be in front of it. So:

Action: gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_3. Then toggle to unlock.

But while holding yellow_ball_1, which is allowed. Then, after unlocking, go to room_3 via gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_1.

Now in room_3. Then, gotoobject grey_box_1 room_3. Pick it up. Then, need to take it to room_4. To do that, unlock red_door_1 again (since after toggling, it's now unlocked). Wait, no, after toggling red_door_1 from room_4, it's unlocked. So the agent can go back to room_4 via red_door_1.

But after picking grey_box_1, the agent is holding it. They need to go to room_4. So:

gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_1.

Then, drop grey_box_1 in room_4. This satisfies the constraint that grey_box_1 is in room_4.

Now, the agent is in room_4, has dropped grey_box_1 there. Now, they need to pick up a grey box again (either grey_box_1 or 2, but grey_box_2 is still in room_3). If grey_box_1 is now in room_4, they can pick it up again. But the goal is to be holding a grey box, so after dropping it, they could pick it up again. But perhaps it's easier to pick grey_box_2 in room_3, but that requires going back to room_3.

Wait, the final goal is to have a grey box being held. So after moving grey_box_1 to room_4, the agent can pick it up again. But let's check:

The agent is in room_4. They need to pick up a grey box. But grey_box_1 is now in room_4. So:

gotoobject grey_box_1 room_4. But to do that, they must be in room_4. Then pick it up. But before that, they need to be in front of purple_ball_1 again if they are going to hold another object. Wait, the constraint says that if in any state the agent is holding an object, there must be a prior state where they were in front of purple_ball_1. So since they already held purple_ball_1 and yellow_ball_1, which required being in front of purple_ball_1, does that cover subsequent holdings? For example, when they pick up grey_box_1 in room_4, they need to have been in front of purple_ball_1 before that. But they were already in front of purple_ball_1 earlier when they picked it up. So that's covered. So they can proceed.

But perhaps the agent needs to pick up grey_box_1 in room_4. However, to get there, they have to drop it there first. So:

After dropping grey_box_1 in room_4, they can pick it up again. But they need to be in front of it. So gotoobject grey_box_1 room_4, then pick it up. That would meet the goal.

But let's check all steps again, considering all constraints.

Let me try to outline the full plan step by step, ensuring each action is valid and all constraints are met:

1. Start in room_3. Need to unlock grey_door_2 to get to room_1.

   - gotodoor grey_door_2 room_3 room_1
   - toggle grey_door_2 (now unlocked)
   - gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_2 (now in room_1)
   
2. In room_1, go to purple_ball_1:

   - gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_1
   - pick purple_ball_1 room_1 (now holding it; satisfies constraint 2 for any future holds)
   
3. Drop purple_ball_1 to free hands:

   - gotoempty room_1
   - drop purple_ball_1 room_1
   
4. Now, go to room_2. Unlock grey_door_1 (connects room_1 and room_2):

   - gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_2
   - toggle grey_door_1 (unlock)
   - gotoroom room_1 room_2 grey_door_1 (now in room_2)
   
5. In room_2, pick up yellow_ball_1:

   - gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_2
   - pick yellow_ball_1 room_2 (now holding it)
   
6. Unlock grey_door_3 (connects room_2 and room_4) while holding yellow_ball_1:

   - gotodoor grey_door_3 room_2 room_4
   - toggle grey_door_3 (unlock; now, in a state where grey_door_3 is unlocked and agent holds yellow_ball_1 → satisfies constraint 5)
   
7. Go to room_4 via grey_door_3:

   - gotoroom room_2 room_4 grey_door_3 (now in room_4 → satisfies constraint 4)
   
8. Now, need to move grey_box_1 to room_4. So return to room_3. But red_door_1 is locked. From room_4, unlock red_door_1:

   - gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_3
   - toggle red_door_1 (unlock)
   - gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_1 (now in room_3)
   
9. In room_3, pick up grey_box_1:

   - gotoobject grey_box_1 room_3
   - pick grey_box_1 room_3 (now holding it)
   
10. Go to room_4 to drop grey_box_1:

    - gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_1 (now in room_4)
    - drop grey_box_1 room_4 (now grey_box_1 is in room_4 → satisfies constraint 3)
    
11. Now, need to be in front of purple_ball_2 (in room_3). So return to room_3:

    - gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_1
    - gotoobject purple_ball_2 room_3 (satisfies constraint 6)
    
12. Now, need to pick up a grey box again. Since grey_box_1 is in room_4, and the agent is in room_3, perhaps pick grey_box_2 which is in room_3:

    - gotoobject grey_box_2 room_3
    - pick grey_box_2 room_3 (now holding a grey box → satisfies the goal)
    
But wait, the agent needs to be holding a grey box. So step 12 would achieve that. However, when they pick grey_box_2, they need to have been in front of purple_ball_1 before. Since they were in front of purple_ball_1 in step 2, this is satisfied.

But wait, step 12 is picking grey_box_2 in room_3. The agent is in room_3 after step 11. So:

Let's check the steps again:

After step 11, agent is in room_3, in front of purple_ball_2. Then they need to pick a grey box. But grey_box_1 is now in room_4. grey_box_2 is still in room_3. So:

11. After dropping grey_box_1 in room_4, agent returns to room_3 (step 10: drop in room_4, then step 11 is goto room_3). Then in room_3, they can goto grey_box_2, pick it up.

So:

11. In room_3 after returning from room_4:

    - gotoobject grey_box_2 room_3
    - pick grey_box_2 room_3 (now holding it → goal achieved)
    
But need to check if all constraints are met.

Constraints:

1. At least one state holding an object: steps 2 (purple_ball_1), 5 (yellow_ball_1), 9 (grey_box_1), 11 (grey_box_2). Satisfied.

2. For each holding state, prior state in front of purple_ball_1. The first holding is step 2, which was preceded by step 2's gotoobject. For subsequent holdings (steps 5,9,11), the initial step 2 already covered the prior being in front of purple_ball_1. So all good.

3. grey_box_1 in room_4: step 10 drop. Satisfied.

4. agent in room_4: step 7 and 10. Satisfied.

5. grey_door_3 unlocked and holding yellow_ball_1: step 6. Satisfied.

6. in front of purple_ball_2: step 11. Wait, step 11 is after returning to room_3. So after step 10, agent is in room_4. Step 11: gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_1 (now in room_3). Then gotoobject purple_ball_2 room_3. So that's step 11. Then step 12: gotoobject grey_box_2. So step 11 is the one that satisfies constraint 6.

Yes.

But wait, in the outlined steps, after step 10 (drop grey_box_1 in room_4), the agent is in room_4. Then step 11 is going back to room_3 via red_door_1. Then in room_3, gotoobject purple_ball_2. Then pick grey_box_2.

So that's correct.

Now, the final step is to pick grey_box_2 in room_3, which is a grey box, thus satisfying the goal.

This plan seems to satisfy all constraints and the goal. Let's check the sequence for validity:

Each action's preconditions must be met.

Step 1: gotodoor grey_door_2 room_3 room_1. In room_3, which is connected via grey_door_2. No object blocking door (assuming initial state allows). Then toggle. Then gotoroom.

Yes.

Step 2: gotoobject purple_ball_1 in room_1. Agent is in room_1. Then pick: agent is in room_1 and not holding anything. Correct.

Step 3: gotoempty (room_1), then drop. Correct.

Step 4: gotodoor grey_door_1 in room_1. Correct. Toggle. Then go to room_2.

Step 5: in room_2, pick yellow_ball_1. Correct.

Step 6: gotodoor grey_door_3 in room_2, toggle. Correct. Now holding yellow_ball_1, door unlocked.

Step 7: goto room_4. Correct.

Step 8: gotodoor red_door_1 in room_4. Toggle. Now unlocked. Gotoroom to room_3.

Step 9: goto grey_box_1 in room_3. Pick. Correct.

Step 10: goto room_4, drop. Correct.

Step 11: goto room_3, then goto purple_ball_2. Correct.

Step 12: goto grey_box_2, pick. Correct.

Now, count the steps. But the problem says to provide the optimal plan, shortest possible.

Wait, can we find a shorter path?

Alternative approach:

What if the agent uses red_door_1 first to get to room_4 quickly, then unlock other doors as needed.

But need to meet all constraints.

Alternatively:

Start in room_3. Unlock red_door_1 (step 1). Go to room_4 (step 2). Now, to get grey_box_1 to room_4, the agent needs to go back to room_3, pick it up, and bring it to room_4. But then, the agent must also go to room_1 to be in front of purple_ball_1 before holding anything. However, since the agent starts in room_3, and the first holding action is when they pick up purple_ball_1, which is in room_1, they need to get there. So unlocking red_door_1 first doesn't help with that.

So the previous plan seems necessary.

Another optimization: when the agent picks up grey_box_1 in room_3 (step 9), maybe they can drop it in room_4 and then pick it up again, satisfying the goal. But the agent needs to be in front of purple_ball_2. So after dropping in room_4, they need to return to room_3 to be in front of purple_ball_2. But that adds steps.

Alternatively, after moving grey_box_1 to room_4, the agent could pick it up there. But then the agent must be in room_4, pick it up, which is allowed since they were in front of purple_ball_1 earlier.

Let me adjust the steps:

After step 10 (grey_box_1 is in room_4):

11. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_4 (agent in room_4)

12. pick grey_box_1 room_4 (now holding it → goal achieved)

But then, the agent needs to have been in front of purple_ball_2. So step 11 would be after returning to room_3. Wait, no. If they pick grey_box_1 in room_4, they need to be in front of purple_ball_2 at some point. So after step 10, agent is in room_4. To satisfy constraint 6 (in front of purple_ball_2), they need to go back to room_3.

So steps after step 10:

11. gotoroom room_4 room_3 red_door_1 (now in room_3)

12. gotoobject purple_ball_2 room_3 (satisfies constraint 6)

13. gotoempty room_3 (to drop if needed)

But agent is not holding anything now. Then, goto room_4 again:

14. gotoroom room_3 room_4 red_door_1

15. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_4

16. pick grey_box_1 room_4 (goal met)

But this adds more steps. So the previous plan with 12 steps is shorter.

Alternatively, after step 10 (drop grey_box_1 in room_4), the agent can immediately go to room_3, goto purple_ball_2, then return to room_4 to pick grey_box_1.

But this adds steps. So the initial plan with picking grey_box_2 in room_3 after being in front of purple_ball_2 is better.

So the initial plan is optimal.
