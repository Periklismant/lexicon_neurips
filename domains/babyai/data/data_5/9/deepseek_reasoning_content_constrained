Okay, let's tackle this planning problem step by step. The goal is to get to a grey door connecting room_4 and room_3, be in front of it, and have it unlocked. Also, there are several constraints to satisfy. Let's start by understanding the initial state and the goal.

Initial State:
- The agent is in room_1.
- All doors are locked: red_door_1 (connecting room_1 and room_2), green_door_1 (room_1 and room_3), purple_door_1 (room_2 and room_4), grey_door_1 (room_3 and room_4).
- Objects are spread across rooms: blue_ball_1 in room_1; red_box_1 and green_ball_1 in room_2; yellow_ball_1, blue_ball_2, green_ball_2, blue_ball_3 in room_3; blue_box_1 in room_4.

Goal:
- There exists a grey door d (which must be grey_door_1) connecting room_4 and room_3, with the agent in front of it and the door unlocked.

Constraints:
1. At some state, grey_door_1 must be unlocked. And if it's unlocked, the agent must have been holding an object or in front of yellow_ball_1 before.
2. The agent must be in room_1 at least once. If they are in room_1 in state s, they must hold an object either at s or after.
3. At some state, the agent is holding an object and green_ball_2 is in room_4.
4. Green_door_1 must remain locked always.
5. The agent must hold green_ball_1 at some state.

First, the main path is to unlock grey_door_1. But all doors start locked, so the agent needs to toggle grey_door_1. To toggle, they need to be in front of it. Grey_door_1 connects room_3 and room_4, so the agent needs to reach either room_3 or room_4 to approach it. But all connecting doors are locked. Let's see possible paths.

From room_1, doors to room_2 (red_door_1) and room_3 (green_door_1) are locked. So the agent can't directly go to room_2 or room_3. Wait, but maybe they need to unlock doors. But to toggle a door, they need to be in front of it. So perhaps the agent needs to unlock red_door_1 or green_door_1 first. But wait, the green_door_1 must stay locked at all times (constraint 4), so we can't unlock it. So the only way is to unlock red_door_1. How?

To unlock red_door_1 (which is in room_1 and room_2), the agent needs to be in front of it. But red_door_1 is in room_1 and room_2. The agent starts in room_1. So they can go to the red_door_1 from room_1. But to go to the door, the position in front of it must not be blocked. Are there any objects blocking the doors? Let's check initial state: In room_1, blue_ball_1 is present. Are objects blocking doors? The problem states that when going to a door, the position in front of it must not be blocked. So if there's an object in front of the door, the agent can't go there. But the initial state doesn't mention objects blocking doors. Wait, the problem's initial state lists where objects are, but does that block doors? For example, blue_ball_1 is in room_1. If the door's front position in room_1 is blocked by blue_ball_1, then the agent can't go to the door. So we need to check if any objects are in front of the doors.

But the initial setup doesn't specify that any objects are blocking doors. The "blocking" seems to be a separate condition. Wait, in the effects of "pick", it mentions that if x was blocking a door, then it's no longer blocking. So perhaps objects can block doors, but the initial state doesn't state that any objects are blocking doors. So maybe doors are not blocked initially. Therefore, the agent can go to red_door_1 in room_1.

So plan steps:

1. From room_1, go to red_door_1 (connecting room_1 and room_2). Action: gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_2. Precondition is that the agent is in a room connected by the door (room_1), and no object is blocking. Assuming no blocking, this is possible.

2. Toggle red_door_1 to unlock it. Action: toggle red_door_1. Now red_door_1 is unlocked.

3. Use red_door_1 to go to room_2. Action: gotoroom room_1 room_2 red_door_1. Now in room_2.

In room_2, there's red_box_1 and green_ball_1. The agent might need to pick up green_ball_1 to satisfy constraint 5 (hold green_ball_1 at some point). Also, constraint 3 requires that at some state, the agent is holding an object and green_ball_2 is in room_4. So we need to move green_ball_2 from room_3 to room_4. But how? Since green_ball_2 is in room_3, and to get to room_3 from room_1 via green_door_1, but green_door_1 is locked and must stay locked (constraint 4). So that path is blocked. So alternative routes: from room_2, there's purple_door_1 connecting to room_4, but it's locked. So perhaps unlock purple_door_1.

So steps after being in room_2:

4. Go to purple_door_1 (connecting room_2 and room_4). Action: gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_4.

5. Toggle purple_door_1 to unlock it. Now purple_door_1 is unlocked.

6. Gotoroom room_2 room_4 purple_door_1. Now in room_4.

In room_4, there's blue_box_1. Now, to get to room_3, need to use grey_door_1 which connects room_4 and room_3. But grey_door_1 is locked. So the agent needs to go to grey_door_1 from room_4, unlock it, then go to room_3, but perhaps the goal is to be in front of grey_door_1 (which is in room_4 and room_3). Wait, the goal says "you are in front of d", but the door is between two rooms. So to be in front of grey_door_1, the agent can be in either room_4 or room_3. Let's check the goal: "you are in front of d". The action to toggle a door requires being in front of it, which is possible from either connected room. So once the agent is in room_4, they can go to grey_door_1, toggle it to unlock, and that's part of the goal.

But first, need to unlock grey_door_1. Let's proceed.

7. In room_4, go to grey_door_1: gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3.

8. Toggle grey_door_1 to unlock it. Now grey_door_1 is unlocked. This satisfies the first part of the goal. Also, this action's state must have the agent in front of grey_door_1 and the door unlocked, so that's the goal. But the problem states the goal is that there exists a door d (grey_door_1) that is grey, connects room_4 and room_3, the agent is in front of it, and it's not locked. So after step 8, the agent is in front of grey_door_1 (from room_4's side), and the door is unlocked. So steps 7 and 8 would satisfy the goal. But let's check constraints.

Constraints:

Constraint 1: grey_door_1 must be unlocked in some state. Yes, after step 8. Also, when that happens, in a previous state, the agent must have been holding an object or in front of yellow_ball_1. So before step 8, the agent must have either held an object or been in front of yellow_ball_1.

But in the current plan, after step 8, the agent toggles grey_door_1 (unlocking it). The state after step 8 has grey_door_1 unlocked. So the previous state (before step 8) must have the agent in front of grey_door_1, but that's when they perform the toggle. Wait, the constraint says that if grey_door_1 is unlocked in a state, then there must be an earlier state where the agent was holding an object or in front of yellow_ball_1. So in this case, the unlocking happens at step 8. The earlier states need to have either the agent holding an object or in front of yellow_ball_1 before step 8.

Looking at the plan so far: steps 1-8. Before step 8, the agent hasn't picked up any objects. So they need to have either held an object or been in front of yellow_ball_1. But yellow_ball_1 is in room_3. To get to room_3, the agent would need to go through grey_door_1, but it was locked until step 8. So unless there's another path. Let's see: From room_1, green_door_1 connects to room_3, but it's locked and must stay locked. So agent can't go that way. So the only way to get to room_3 is via room_4 and grey_door_1 after unlocking it. But in the current plan, the agent is in room_4, goes to grey_door_1 (step7), then unlocks it (step8). So before step8, they haven't been to room_3. So they can't have been in front of yellow_ball_1. Therefore, the agent must have held an object before step8. But in the current plan, the agent hasn't picked up any objects. So this violates constraint1. So we need to adjust the plan.

So the agent must hold an object before unlocking grey_door_1. Let's see. Let's modify the plan.

Alternative approach:

After reaching room_4 (step6), perhaps the agent can pick up the blue_box_1 in room_4. Wait, blue_box_1 is a box in room_4. To pick it up, the agent must be in the same room as the object (room_4), not holding anything. Let's check the steps:

After step6, the agent is in room_4, not holding anything.

7. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_4. Precondition: in room_4. Then pick blue_box_1 room_4. Then drop it somewhere else if needed. But why?

Holding an object would satisfy some constraints. For example, constraint5 says the agent must hold green_ball_1 at some state. But if the agent picks up blue_box_1, that's not green_ball_1. So maybe instead, the agent needs to go back and get green_ball_1 from room_2.

Wait, let's look at constraint5: The agent must hold green_ball_1 at some state. So they need to pick it up. green_ball_1 is in room_2. So the plan must include picking up green_ball_1. Also, constraint3 requires that in some state, the agent is holding an object and green_ball_2 is in room_4. So green_ball_2 starts in room_3. To get it to room_4, the agent must carry it there. But how to get to room_3? Since green_door_1 is locked and must stay locked, the only way to room_3 is via grey_door_1 after unlocking it. But to unlock grey_door_1, the agent must be in room_4 or room_3. If they are in room_4, unlock grey_door_1, then go to room_3. Then in room_3, they can pick up green_ball_2 and bring it to room_4 via grey_door_1.

But this seems complicated. Let's outline steps again, considering all constraints.

Constraints to satisfy:

- Must be in room_1 at least once (constraint2). The agent starts in room_1. So that's covered, but after moving to other rooms, they might need to return. However, constraint2 also says that if the agent is in room_1 in some state s, they must hold an object at s or after. Since the initial state has them in room_1 without holding, but after leaving, they might return. So if the agent returns to room_1, they need to have picked up an object then or after.

But let's see the initial steps. The agent starts in room_1. So the first state is in room_1, not holding anything. But constraint2 requires that if they are in room_1 in any state, then they must hold an object at that state or after. So the initial state is allowed, but if they return to room_1 later, they need to hold an object then or later. However, in our current plan, after leaving room_1 (step3), they don't return. So the initial state counts as a state where they are in room_1. So constraint2's first part is satisfied (they are in room_1 at least once). But the second part says that any state where they are in room_1 must have them holding an object either in that state or after. Since the initial state has them in room_1 not holding, but they leave room_1 and don't return, that's okay. Because the constraint is: if you are in room_1 in some state s, then you must hold an object in s or after. So since they leave room_1 and never return, the only s where they are in room_1 is the initial state. In that state, they aren't holding, but after that state (in subsequent steps), they do pick up objects (like green_ball_1 in room_2). So the constraint is satisfied if after the initial state, they eventually hold an object. Which they do when picking up green_ball_1. So that's okay.

But let's make sure.

Now, back to the problem. The main goal is to unlock grey_door_1 and be in front of it. Also, the constraints require that when grey_door_1 is unlocked, there was a prior state where the agent held an object or was in front of yellow_ball_1. So the agent must hold an object before unlocking grey_door_1.

So let's adjust the plan to include picking up an object before step8.

Here's a revised plan:

1. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_1 (since blue_ball_1 is in room_1)
2. pick blue_ball_1 room_1
3. drop blue_ball_1 room_1 (maybe not necessary, but let's see)

But this may not help. Alternatively, after unlocking red_door_1 and entering room_2, the agent can pick up green_ball_1 (satisfying constraint5). Then proceed to room_4, then unlock grey_door_1. Let's try:

1. gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_2
2. toggle red_door_1 (unlocks it)
3. gotoroom room_1 room_2 red_door_1 (now in room_2)
4. gotoobject green_ball_1 room_2
5. pick green_ball_1 room_2 (now holding it; satisfies constraint5)
6. Now, need to go to room_4. So go to purple_door_1 in room_2.
   gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_4
7. toggle purple_door_1 (unlock)
8. gotoroom room_2 room_4 purple_door_1 (now in room_4)
9. Now in room_4. Need to unlock grey_door_1. So:
   gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3
10. toggle grey_door_1 (unlocks it; now satisfies the goal condition, but need to check constraints)

At step10, grey_door_1 is unlocked. The constraint1 requires that before this, the agent was holding an object or in front of yellow_ball_1. Since the agent is holding green_ball_1 from step5 until step10 (unless they dropped it). Wait, no. Once the agent picks up green_ball_1 in step5, they are holding it. To perform other actions like gotodoor, they don't need to drop it. So at step10, they are still holding green_ball_1. Therefore, when they toggle grey_door_1 (step10), the previous state (step9) has them holding green_ball_1, which satisfies constraint1's condition (earlier state where they held an object). So this is okay.

But after step10, the agent is in front of grey_door_1, which is unlocked. So this satisfies the goal. But the goal requires being in front of d (grey_door_1) and d is unlocked. So step10 is the toggle action, which is performed in front of grey_door_1. After toggle, the door is unlocked. So the final state after step10 would have the agent in front of grey_door_1 and the door is unlocked. So that meets the goal.

But also, the agent must drop the green_ball_1 at some point if needed. But for the plan to end, the agent just needs to be in front of the unlocked grey_door_1. So steps up to step10 may suffice. Let's check constraints.

Constraints:

1. grey_door_1 is not locked in some state (step10). And before that, the agent was holding green_ball_1 (from step5 onward). So that's satisfied.

2. Agent was in room_1 (initial state and step1-3). The initial state counts, and after that, they left. The constraint requires that if in room_1, then in that state or after, hold an object. In the initial state, they weren't holding, but after step5, they did hold an object. So that's okay.

3. At some state, agent is holding an object and green_ball_2 is in room_4. Currently, green_ball_2 is in room_3. To get it to room_4, the agent must carry it there. But in the current plan, the agent is in room_4 and hasn't touched green_ball_2. So this constraint isn't met. So need to adjust the plan to move green_ball_2 to room_4.

So how? The agent is in room_4 (after step8). To get green_ball_2 from room_3 to room_4, the agent needs to:

- Go to room_3 via grey_door_1 (now unlocked after step10)
- Pick up green_ball_2 in room_3
- Return to room_4 and drop it.

But after step10, the agent is in front of grey_door_1 in room_4. So to go to room_3:

11. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1 (now in room_3)
12. gotoobject green_ball_2 room_3
13. pick green_ball_2 room_3 (must drop current object first, but the agent is holding green_ball_1. So they can't pick another. Therefore, need to drop green_ball_1 first.

Wait, the agent can only hold one object at a time. So to pick up green_ball_2, they must drop green_ball_1 first. But where?

After step10, the agent is in room_4. To drop green_ball_1:

10. After step9 (agent in front of grey_door_1 in room_4), drop green_ball_1 in room_4. But to drop, they need to be in front of an empty position. So:

9. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3
10. drop green_ball_1 room_4 (must be in front of empty position. So maybe gotoempty first?)

Wait, after step8, the agent is in room_4. Then step9 is gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3. Then step10: toggle grey_door_1 (unlock). Then the agent is in front of grey_door_1. To drop green_ball_1, they need to be in front of an empty position. So after step10:

11. gotoempty in room_4.

12. drop green_ball_1 room_4. Now, hands are empty.

13. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1 (to room_3)

14. gotoobject green_ball_2 room_3

15. pick green_ball_2 room_3

16. gotoroom room_3 room_4 grey_door_1

17. gotoempty room_4

18. drop green_ball_2 room_4. Now green_ball_2 is in room_4.

Now, in state after step18, the agent is holding nothing, and green_ball_2 is in room_4. But the constraint3 requires that in at least one state, the agent is holding an object AND green_ball_2 is in room_4. So that state would be when the agent is holding green_ball_2 and has not yet dropped it. For example, in step15-16, the agent is holding green_ball_2, but green_ball_2 is still in room_3. When they move to room_4 (step16), green_ball_2 is now in room_4 (since drop happens in step18). So after step16, the agent is in room_4 holding green_ball_2. But the object's location hasn't changed yet; the object's location changes only when dropped. So when the agent picks up green_ball_2 in room_3 (step15), the ball is removed from room_3. Then, when the agent drops it in room_4 (step18), it's placed there. So during steps15-18, the agent is holding green_ball_2, and after step18, it's in room_4. So the state during step16 (agent in room_4 holding green_ball_2, but green_ball_2 hasn't been dropped yet) – no, because the ball is carried. The effect of pick is that the object is no longer in the room. So after step15, green_ball_2 is not in room_3, and the agent is carrying it. When they move to room_4, they are still carrying it. So until they drop it in room_4 (step18), green_ball_2 is not in any room. Therefore, the state where green_ball_2 is in room_4 is after step18. But in that state, the agent is not holding anything. Therefore, the only state where the agent is holding green_ball_2 and green_ball_2 is in room_4 is during step18, but that's when they drop it. Wait, no. When they drop it, the ball is placed in room_4, and the agent is no longer holding it. So the state after step18 has green_ball_2 in room_4 and the agent not holding. So the only state where both conditions are true is during the drop action's effect. But according to the problem statement, effects are applied after the action. So during the execution of the 'drop' action, the agent is holding the object before the action, and after the action, they are not. So the state after the drop action has green_ball_2 in room_4 and the agent not holding. Therefore, there's no state where the agent is holding an object and green_ball_2 is in room_4. Hmm, this is a problem.

To satisfy constraint3, the agent must be holding an object AND green_ball_2 is in room_4 in the same state. But how? Because when the agent is holding green_ball_2, it's not in any room. Only after dropping it does it appear in room_4. So the only way this can happen is if the agent is holding another object while green_ball_2 is in room_4. For example:

- Agent picks up green_ball_1 (satisfies constraint5), drops it somewhere, then picks up another object while green_ball_2 is in room_4.

Alternatively, maybe after moving green_ball_2 to room_4, the agent picks up another object there. Let's think.

After step18, green_ball_2 is in room_4. The agent is in room_4, not holding anything. So they could pick up blue_box_1 (if possible):

19. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_4

20. pick blue_box_1 room_4

Now, in state 20, the agent is holding blue_box_1 and green_ball_2 is in room_4. This satisfies constraint3. So this state (step20) meets the condition.

So integrating this into the plan:

So steps would be:

1. gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_2
2. toggle red_door_1
3. gotoroom room_1 room_2 red_door_1
4. gotoobject green_ball_1 room_2
5. pick green_ball_1 room_2
6. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_4
7. toggle purple_door_1
8. gotoroom room_2 room_4 purple_door_1
9. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3
10. toggle grey_door_1
11. gotoempty room_4
12. drop green_ball_1 room_4
13. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1
14. gotoobject green_ball_2 room_3
15. pick green_ball_2 room_3
16. gotoroom room_3 room_4 grey_door_1
17. gotoempty room_4
18. drop green_ball_2 room_4
19. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_4
20. pick blue_box_1 room_4

Now, in step20, the agent is holding blue_box_1, and green_ball_2 is in room_4 (step18). So constraint3 is satisfied at step20.

But we need to check if all constraints are met:

Constraint3: At least one state where agent is holding an object and green_ball_2 is in room_4. Step20: agent holds blue_box_1, green_ball_2 in room_4. Yes.

Constraint5: Agent holds green_ball_1 at some state. Steps5-12: agent holds green_ball_1. Yes.

Constraint1: grey_door_1 unlocked at step10, and prior state where agent held an object (steps5-12, agent was holding green_ball_1 before step10). Yes.

Constraint4: green_door_1 remains locked. The plan never toggles green_door_1, so yes.

Constraint2: agent was in room_1 initially (step0), and after that, they hold green_ball_1 (step5 onwards). So yes.

Constraint6: agent must be holding green_ball_1. Step5: yes.

Now, the main goal is to be in front of grey_door_1 and it's unlocked. After step9, the agent is in front of grey_door_1. Then step10 toggles it to unlock. After step10, the agent is still in front of grey_door_1 (since gotodoor brings them there, and toggle doesn't move them). Wait, the effects of toggle are that the door's lock state changes, but the agent's position remains in front of the door. So after step10 (toggle), the agent is still in front of grey_door_1, and the door is unlocked. So that satisfies the goal.

Therefore, the plan up to step10 would satisfy the goal. But need to include the other steps to meet all constraints. However, after step10, the agent needs to proceed to move green_ball_2 and pick up blue_box_1. But the main goal is already met at step10. So the rest of the steps are for meeting constraints. However, the problem requires that the plan brings about the goal. So the plan must end when the goal is achieved. But the goal is "there exists a door d (grey_door_1) such that d is grey, connects room_4 and room_3, agent is in front of d, and d is not locked". So the earliest step where this is true is after step10. Therefore, the plan can end at step10. However, the constraints require other conditions, so the agent must perform additional steps. But the problem says that the plan must bring about the goal while satisfying all constraints. So the plan must include all actions necessary to achieve the goal and meet the constraints, but after the goal is achieved, the agent can have additional actions as long as the constraints are still met.

But the optimal plan should be the shortest possible. So perhaps there's a way to satisfy all constraints with fewer steps.

Alternative approach: After unlocking grey_door_1 (step10), the agent is in front of it, which meets the goal. Then, they can proceed to handle the constraints.

But let's see:

In the previous plan, steps up to step10 meet the goal but not all constraints. Steps 11-20 are for constraints. So the total plan length is 20 steps. But maybe there's a shorter way.

Wait, maybe after step10 (unlocking grey_door_1), the agent can go to room_3, pick green_ball_2, return to room_4, drop it, then pick up blue_box_1. But this would take steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the agent can pick up green_ball_1 in room_2, then go to room_4, unlock grey_door_1, then go to room_3 and get green_ball_2. But this requires more steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the agent can carry green_ball_1 to room_4, drop it there, then proceed to unlock grey_door_1, then go to room_3, pick green_ball_2, and return.

But let's think of a more optimized path.

Another possible route:

1. Start in room_1.

2. Gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_2.

3. Toggle red_door_1 (unlock).

4. Gotoroom room_1 room_2 red_door_1.

5. Gotoobject green_ball_1 room_2.

6. Pick green_ball_1.

7. Gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_4.

8. Toggle purple_door_1 (unlock).

9. Gotoroom room_2 room_4 purple_door_1.

10. Drop green_ball_1 in room_4.

11. Gotoempty (if needed to drop).

Wait, to drop, the agent needs to be in front of an empty position, which requires a gotoempty action.

So:

10. gotoempty room_4.

11. drop green_ball_1 room_4.

Now, green_ball_1 is in room_4.

12. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3.

13. toggle grey_door_1 (unlock).

Now, at step13, grey_door_1 is unlocked, and agent is in front of it. So the goal is met. Also, before this, the agent was holding green_ball_1 until step11. So when they toggle grey_door_1 at step13, the previous state (step12) they weren't holding anything, but earlier they held green_ball_1 (steps6-11). So constraint1 is satisfied because there was an earlier state where the agent held an object (green_ball_1) before unlocking grey_door_1.

Now, to satisfy constraint3 (holding an object and green_ball_2 in room_4), the agent needs to get green_ball_2 to room_4 and hold an object while it's there.

So:

14. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1.

15. gotoobject green_ball_2 room_3.

16. pick green_ball_2.

17. gotoroom room_3 room_4 grey_door_1.

18. gotoempty room_4.

19. drop green_ball_2 room_4.

20. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_4.

21. pick blue_box_1.

Now, step21: agent holds blue_box_1 and green_ball_2 is in room_4 (step19). So constraint3 is met.

But this plan is longer. The initial approach had 20 steps, this has 21. Maybe there's a shorter way.

Alternatively, after step13 (goal met), the agent can proceed to room_3, pick green_ball_2, return to room_4, drop it, then pick blue_box_1. This adds steps, but necessary for constraint3.

However, the problem requires an optimal plan with minimal length. So perhaps there's a way to overlap some steps.

Another idea: When the agent is in room_4 after step9, they can drop green_ball_1, then proceed to unlock grey_door_1. Then, when they go to room_3 to get green_ball_2, they can pick it up, return to room_4, drop it, and then pick up green_ball_1 again. But this seems longer.

Alternatively, after dropping green_ball_1 in room_4 (step11), the agent can go to grey_door_1, unlock it (step12-13), then go to room_3 to get green_ball_2, then bring it back to room_4. Then, in room_4, pick up green_ball_1 again (which was dropped there) while green_ball_2 is in room_4. This would satisfy constraint3.

But this requires:

After step13:

14. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1.

15. gotoobject green_ball_2 room_3.

16. pick green_ball_2.

17. gotoroom room_3 room_4 grey_door_1.

18. gotoempty room_4.

19. drop green_ball_2 room_4.

20. gotoobject green_ball_1 room_4.

21. pick green_ball_1.

Now, in step21, agent is holding green_ball_1 and green_ball_2 is in room_4. This satisfies constraint3.

But this adds steps. However, this is necessary to satisfy the constraints.

But this plan has 21 steps. Is there a shorter way?

Alternatively, perhaps the agent can carry green_ball_1 into room_4, then drop it, then unlock grey_door_1. Then, go to room_3, pick green_ball_2, and carry it to room_4. Then, in room_4, pick up green_ball_1 again. But this still requires multiple steps.

Wait, in the initial plan up to step10, the agent is in front of grey_door_1, which is unlocked. That's the goal. But to satisfy all constraints, they need to perform additional steps. However, the problem states that the plan must bring about the goal and satisfy all constraints. So the plan must include those steps.

But the optimal plan is the shortest possible. Let's think again.

Maybe the agent doesn't need to move green_ball_2 to room_4. Wait, constraint3 requires that in some state, the agent is holding an object AND green_ball_2 is in room_4. So green_ball_2 must be moved to room_4. So the agent must carry it there.

So the steps are unavoidable. The minimal plan would require moving green_ball_2 to room_4 and then holding another object there.

But perhaps there's a way to carry green_ball_1 and green_ball_2 at the same time. But the agent can only hold one object at a time. So that's impossible.

Thus, the minimal plan would require:

- Unlock red_door_1, pick green_ball_1.

- Unlock purple_door_1, go to room_4.

- Drop green_ball_1.

- Unlock grey_door_1.

- Go to room_3, pick green_ball_2, return to room_4 and drop.

- Pick up green_ball_1 again (or another object like blue_box_1) while green_ball_2 is in room_4.

This seems necessary.

So the steps would be:

1. gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_2
2. toggle red_door_1
3. gotoroom room_1 room_2 red_door_1
4. gotoobject green_ball_1 room_2
5. pick green_ball_1 room_2
6. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_4
7. toggle purple_door_1
8. gotoroom room_2 room_4 purple_door_1
9. gotoempty room_4
10. drop green_ball_1 room_4
11. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3
12. toggle grey_door_1
13. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1
14. gotoobject green_ball_2 room_3
15. pick green_ball_2 room_3
16. gotoroom room_3 room_4 grey_door_1
17. gotoempty room_4
18. drop green_ball_2 room_4
19. gotoobject green_ball_1 room_4
20. pick green_ball_1 room_4

Now, step20: agent holds green_ball_1, and green_ball_2 is in room_4 (step18). So this satisfies constraint3. Also, the goal was achieved at step12.

But the plan continues after step12 to meet the constraints. However, the problem requires that the plan brings about the goal and satisfies all constraints. The goal is achieved at step12, but the constraints require actions after that. So the complete plan must include steps up to step20. However, the problem asks for an optimal plan, which is the shortest possible. Is there a way to shorten this?

Alternative idea: After step12, the agent is in front of grey_door_1, unlocked. The goal is met. The constraints require:

- green_ball_2 in room_4 and agent holding an object.

So maybe after step12, the agent can go to room_3, pick green_ball_2, return to room_4, drop it, and then pick up green_ball_1. But that requires steps.

Alternatively, if the agent can pick up blue_box_1 in room_4 after dropping green_ball_2, that would also work. Let's see:

After step18, drop green_ball_2 in room_4.

19. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_4

20. pick blue_box_1 room_4

Now, in step20, agent holds blue_box_1 and green_ball_2 is in room_4. So this meets constraint3. This is two steps instead of three (steps19-20 instead of steps19-20).

But this depends on the agent being able to pick up blue_box_1 in room_4.

So steps:

1. gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_2

2. toggle red_door_1

3. gotoroom room_1 room_2 red_door_1

4. gotoobject green_ball_1 room_2

5. pick green_ball_1 room_2

6. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_4

7. toggle purple_door_1

8. gotoroom room_2 room_4 purple_door_1

9. gotoempty room_4

10. drop green_ball_1 room_4

11. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3

12. toggle grey_door_1

13. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1

14. gotoobject green_ball_2 room_3

15. pick green_ball_2 room_3

16. gotoroom room_3 room_4 grey_door_1

17. gotoempty room_4

18. drop green_ball_2 room_4

19. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_4

20. pick blue_box_1 room_4

Now, step20 meets constraint3. The plan has 20 steps. The goal is achieved at step12.

But the problem requires that the plan ends when the goal is achieved, but the constraints might require further actions. However, the problem states to bring about the goal while satisfying all constraints. So the plan must include all necessary actions to meet the constraints, even after the goal is achieved.

So the final plan includes steps up to step20. However, the optimal plan must be as short as possible. Are there redundant steps?

For example, after step10 (drop green_ball_1), steps11-12: go to grey_door_1 and unlock. Then steps13-20 are for moving green_ball_2 and picking blue_box_1.

But perhaps there's a way to combine some steps.

Wait, after step12 (toggle grey_door_1), the agent is in front of grey_door_1 in room_4, which meets the goal. So the plan can end here if the constraints are already met. But the constraints require:

- green_ball_2 to be in room_4 and agent holding an object. So steps after 12 are necessary.

But how to make this as short as possible.

Let's try to find the minimal steps:

1. gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_2

2. toggle red_door_1

3. gotoroom room_1 room_2 red_door_1

4. gotoobject green_ball_1 room_2

5. pick green_ball_1 room_2 (constraint5 met)

6. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_4

7. toggle purple_door_1

8. gotoroom room_2 room_4 purple_door_1 (now in room_4)

9. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3

10. toggle grey_door_1 (goal met here)

Now, after step10, agent is in front of grey_door_1, unlocked. But constraints:

- constraint3 requires agent holding an object and green_ball_2 in room_4.

But green_ball_2 is still in room_3. So the agent must carry it to room_4.

But currently, the agent is holding green_ball_1. So:

11. gotoempty room_4

12. drop green_ball_1 room_4

13. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1

14. gotoobject green_ball_2 room_3

15. pick green_ball_2 room_3

16. gotoroom room_3 room_4 grey_door_1

17. gotoempty room_4

18. drop green_ball_2 room_4 (now green_ball_2 in room_4)

19. gotoobject green_ball_1 room_4

20. pick green_ball_1 room_4 (now holding green_ball_1, green_ball_2 in room_4: constraint3 met)

This is 20 steps. Alternatively, after step18, pick up blue_box_1 in room_4:

18. drop green_ball_2 room_4

19. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_4

20. pick blue_box_1 room_4 (now holding blue_box_1, green_ball_2 in room_4: constraint3 met)

Which is 20 steps.

Thus, the minimal plan length seems to be 20 steps. But is there a way to shorten this?

Wait, in the initial steps, after step5 (pick green_ball_1), the agent goes to room_4. Then, instead of dropping green_ball_1, perhaps the agent can carry it through grey_door_1 and use it to meet constraint3.

But how?

If the agent carries green_ball_1 to room_3, then picks green_ball_2 and carries both? No, can't carry two.

Alternative plan:

1. gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_2

2. toggle red_door_1

3. gotoroom room_1 room_2 red_door_1

4. gotoobject green_ball_1 room_2

5. pick green_ball_1

6. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_4

7. toggle purple_door_1

8. gotoroom room_2 room_4 purple_door_1

9. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3

10. toggle grey_door_1

11. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1

12. drop green_ball_1 room_3 (but why?)

No, this complicates things.

Alternatively, after step10 (unlock grey_door_1), the agent is holding green_ball_1. So in that state, green_ball_1 is in room_4 (since the agent is in room_4), but no, the agent is carrying it. So green_ball_1 is not in any room. To have green_ball_2 in room_4, the agent must drop it there. But to do that, they need to go to room_3, pick green_ball_2, and drop it in room_4. This seems unavoidable.

Thus, the minimal plan seems to require around 20 steps. But perhaps there's a smarter way.

Wait, when the agent is in room_4 after step8, they have green_ball_1. Instead of dropping it, perhaps they can take it through grey_door_1 after unlocking, drop it in room_3, then pick green_ball_2 and bring it back. But this would require:

After step10:

11. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1

12. gotoempty room_3

13. drop green_ball_1 room_3

14. gotoobject green_ball_2 room_3

15. pick green_ball_2

16. gotoroom room_3 room_4 grey_door_1

17. drop green_ball_2 room_4

18. gotoobject green_ball_1 room_3 (but no, it's in room_3)

This seems to complicate things more.

Alternatively, after step10, the agent is in room_4, holding green_ball_1. They can gotoempty, drop green_ball_1, then go to room_3, pick green_ball_2, return, and then pick green_ball_1 again.

Steps:

10. toggle grey_door_1 (unlocked)

11. gotoempty room_4

12. drop green_ball_1 room_4

13. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1

14. gotoobject green_ball_2 room_3

15. pick green_ball_2

16. gotoroom room_3 room_4 grey_door_1

17. gotoempty room_4

18. drop green_ball_2 room_4

19. gotoobject green_ball_1 room_4

20. pick green_ball_1

This is 20 steps. Same as before.

Thus, it seems the minimal plan is 20 steps. However, perhaps there's a way to avoid some steps. For example, combining the drop and pick actions.

But according to the action preconditions, you can't pick an object unless you're in the same room and not holding anything. So steps are necessary.

In conclusion, the optimal plan must include the steps to unlock the necessary doors, move the required balls, and ensure all constraints are met. The final answer will reflect this.
