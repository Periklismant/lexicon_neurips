Let me go through this gridworld planning problem step by step. I'll start by understanding the constraints, analyzing the initial state, and determining what steps I need to take to achieve the goal.

The goal is to have:
- A door d such that d is grey, connects room_4 and room_3, is in front of you, and is not locked

This is specifically referring to the grey_door_1 that connects room_3 and room_4.

There are several constraints to my plan:
1. At some point, grey_door_1 must be unlocked
2. Before I can unlock grey_door_1, I must either be holding some object or be in front of yellow_ball_1
3. I must be in room_1 at some point
4. After being in room_1, I must hold some object at that state or a later state
5. At some point, I must be holding an object while green_ball_2 is in room_4
6. green_door_1 must remain locked throughout
7. At some point, I must be holding green_ball_1

Let me analyze the initial state:
- I start in room_1
- blue_ball_1 is in room_1
- I'm not holding any object
- All doors are locked
- There are various balls and boxes in different rooms
- yellow_ball_1 is in room_3
- green_ball_1 is in room_2
- green_ball_2 is in room_3 (needs to be moved to room_4)

Given these constraints, here's my initial thinking on a plan:

1. I start in room_1, which satisfies constraint 3
2. I need to pick up an object in room_1 (blue_ball_1) to satisfy constraint 4
3. I need to move to room_2 to pick up green_ball_1 (to satisfy constraint 7)
4. I need to move green_ball_2 from room_3 to room_4 (for constraint 5)
5. I need to either hold an object or be in front of yellow_ball_1 before unlocking grey_door_1 (constraint 2)
6. Finally, I need to be in front of grey_door_1 between room_3 and room_4, with it unlocked (goal)

Let me start crafting a plan:

1. Start in room_1
2. Go to blue_ball_1, pick it up (satisfying constraint 4)
3. Go to red_door_1, unlock it
4. Go to room_2 through red_door_1
5. Drop blue_ball_1
6. Go to green_ball_1, pick it up (satisfying constraint 7)
7. Go to purple_door_1, unlock it
8. Go to room_4 through purple_door_1
9. Drop green_ball_1
10. Go to grey_door_1
11. I need to handle constraint 2 and 5 still...

Wait, I need to be more careful. Let me reconsider how to satisfy all constraints:

- I need to be holding an object while green_ball_2 is in room_4 (constraint 5)
- Before unlocking grey_door_1, I must be holding an object or in front of yellow_ball_1 (constraint 2)
- I need to hold green_ball_1 at some point (constraint 7)

Given the layout, I need to revise my plan. Let me think more carefully:

1. Go to blue_ball_1 in room_1 and pick it up
2. Go to red_door_1 and unlock it
3. Go to room_2
4. Drop blue_ball_1
5. Go to green_ball_1 and pick it up (satisfying constraint 7)
6. Go back to red_door_1
7. Go to room_1
8. Go to green_door_1 and unlock it
9. Go to room_3
10. Drop green_ball_1
11. Go to yellow_ball_1 (satisfying part of constraint 2)
12. Pick up green_ball_2
13. Go to grey_door_1 and unlock it (after being in front of yellow_ball_1, satisfying constraint 2)
14. Go to room_4 (bringing green_ball_2 to room_4)
15. Drop green_ball_2 in room_4 (now green_ball_2 is in room_4)
16. Pick up something in room_4 (like blue_box_1) (to satisfy constraint 5 - holding an object while green_ball_2 is in room_4)
17. Go to grey_door_1
18. The goal is achieved: grey_door_1 is unlocked, connects room_4 and room_3, and I'm in front of it

But wait, I'm not sure if I can unlock green_door_1 in this plan, because constraint 6 says green_door_1 must remain locked. Let me rethink...

If I can't unlock green_door_1, I would need a different route to room_3. The connections are:
- room_1 and room_2 via red_door_1
- room_1 and room_3 via green_door_1 (must remain locked)
- room_2 and room_4 via purple_door_1
- room_3 and room_4 via grey_door_1

So the only route to room_3 without using green_door_1 is: room_1 -> room_2 -> room_4 -> room_3.

Let me revise my plan:

1. Go to blue_ball_1 in room_1 and pick it up
2. Go to red_door_1 and unlock it
3. Go to room_2
4. Drop blue_ball_1
5. Go to green_ball_1 and pick it up (satisfying constraint 7)
6. Go to purple_door_1 and unlock it
7. Go to room_4
8. Drop green_ball_1 somewhere in room_4
9. Go to grey_door_1 and unlock it (need to handle constraint 2)
10. Go to room_3
11. Go to yellow_ball_1 (satisfying part of constraint 2)
12. Go back to grey_door_1
13. Unlock grey_door_1 (after being in front of yellow_ball_1, satisfying constraint 2)
14. Pick up green_ball_2
15. Go to room_4 (bringing green_ball_2 to room_4)
16. Drop green_ball_2 in room_4 (now green_ball_2 is in room_4)
17. Pick up green_ball_1 or blue_box_1 in room_4 (to satisfy constraint 5 - holding an object while green_ball_2 is in room_4)
18. Go to grey_door_1
19. The goal is achieved: grey_door_1 is unlocked, connects room_4 and room_3, and I'm in front of it

Wait, this has a problem with constraint 2. I need to either be holding an object or be in front of yellow_ball_1 before unlocking grey_door_1.

Let me rethink, making sure I handle constraints 2 and 5 properly:

1. In room_1, go to blue_ball_1 and pick it up (satisfying constraint 4)
2. Go to red_door_1 and unlock it
3. Go to room_2
4. Drop blue_ball_1
5. Go to green_ball_1 and pick it up (satisfying constraint 7)
6. Go to purple_door_1 and unlock it
7. Go to room_4
8. Go to grey_door_1 (while holding green_ball_1)
9. At this point I'm holding green_ball_1, which satisfies part of constraint 2
10. Unlock grey_door_1 (while holding green_ball_1, satisfying constraint 2)
11. Go to room_3
12. Go to green_ball_2 and pick it up (would need to drop green_ball_1 first)
13. Go back to grey_door_1
14. Go to room_4 (bringing green_ball_2 to room_4)
15. Drop green_ball_2 in room_4 (now green_ball_2 is in room_4)
16. Pick up blue_box_1 in room_4 (to satisfy constraint 5 - holding an object while green_ball_2 is in room_4)
17. Go to grey_door_1
18. The goal is achieved: grey_door_1 is unlocked, connects room_4 and room_3, and I'm in front of it

I see the issue now. I need to carefully sequence my actions to ensure all constraints are met.

Let's try again:

1. In room_1, go to blue_ball_1 and pick it up (satisfying constraint 4)
2. Go to red_door_1 and unlock it
3. Go to room_2
4. Drop blue_ball_1
5. Go to green_ball_1 and pick it up (satisfying constraint 7)
6. Go to purple_door_1 and unlock it
7. Go to room_4
8. Go to grey_door_1 (while holding green_ball_1)
9. Unlock grey_door_1 (while holding green_ball_1, satisfying constraint 2)
10. Go to room_3
11. Drop green_ball_1
12. Go to green_ball_2 and pick it up
13. Go back to grey_door_1
14. Go to room_4 (bringing green_ball_2 to room_4)
15. Drop green_ball_2 in room_4 (now green_ball_2 is in room_4)
16. Pick up something in room_4 (like blue_box_1) (to satisfy constraint 5 - holding an object while green_ball_2 is in room_4)
17. Go to grey_door_1
18. The goal is achieved: grey_door_1 is unlocked, connects room_4 and room_3, and I'm in front of it

This plan should satisfy all constraints:
- I'm in room_1 at the beginning (constraint 3)
- After being in room_1, I pick up blue_ball_1 (constraint 4)
- I hold green_ball_1 at step 5 (constraint 7)
- green_door_1 remains locked throughout (constraint 6)
- I unlock grey_door_1 while holding green_ball_1 (constraint 2)
- At step 16, I'm holding blue_box_1 while green_ball_2 is in room_4 (constraint 5)
- The goal is achieved at step 18

I need to write this in the formal action notation. Let me do that:

1. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_1
2. pick blue_ball_1 room_1
3. gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_2
4. toggle red_door_1
5. gotoroom room_1 room_2 red_door_1
6. gotoempty
7. drop blue_ball_1 room_2
8. gotoobject green_ball_1 room_2
9. pick green_ball_1 room_2
10. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_4
11. toggle purple_door_1
12. gotoroom room_2 room_4 purple_door_1
13. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3
14. toggle grey_door_1
15. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1
16. gotoempty
17. drop green_ball_1 room_3
18. gotoobject green_ball_2 room_3
19. pick green_ball_2 room_3
20. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4
21. gotoroom room_3 room_4 grey_door_1
22. gotoempty
23. drop green_ball_2 room_4
24. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_4
25. pick blue_box_1 room_4
26. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3
27. The goal is achieved

Wait, I notice that the final goal is to be in front of grey_door_1 when it's unlocked, but my last action isn't achieving this exactly. Let me fix that:

1. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_1
2. pick blue_ball_1 room_1
3. gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_2
4. toggle red_door_1
5. gotoroom room_1 room_2 red_door_1
6. gotoempty
7. drop blue_ball_1 room_2
8. gotoobject green_ball_1 room_2
9. pick green_ball_1 room_2
10. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_4
11. toggle purple_door_1
12. gotoroom room_2 room_4 purple_door_1
13. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3
14. toggle grey_door_1  
15. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1
16. gotoempty
17. drop green_ball_1 room_3
18. gotoobject green_ball_2 room_3
19. pick green_ball_2 room_3
20. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4
21. gotoroom room_3 room_4 grey_door_1
22. gotoempty
23. drop green_ball_2 room_4
24. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_4
25. pick blue_box_1 room_4
26. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3

Now the last action gets me in front of grey_door_1 while it's unlocked and I'm holding an object.

I need to double-check this plan:

Constraint 1: At some point, grey_door_1 must be unlocked - Satisfied at step 14
Constraint 2: Before unlocking grey_door_1, I must either be holding an object or be in front of yellow_ball_1 - Satisfied because I'm holding green_ball_1 at step 14
Constraint 3: I must be in room_1 at some point - Satisfied at the beginning
Constraint 4: After being in room_1, I must hold some object - Satisfied at step 2
Constraint 5: At some point, I must be holding an object while green_ball_2 is in room_4 - Satisfied after step 25, I'm holding blue_box_1 and green_ball_2 is in room_4
Constraint 6: green_door_1 must remain locked throughout - Satisfied, I never toggle green_door_1
Constraint 7: At some point, I must be holding green_ball_1 - Satisfied at step 9

The goal is also satisfied at the final step: I'm in front of grey_door_1, which is unlocked and connects room_4 and room_3.

Let me verify one more thing: after I unlock grey_door_1 at step 14, does it remain unlocked for the rest of the plan? Yes, doors stay in their state until toggled again, and I don't toggle grey_door_1 again in the plan.

This plan satisfies all constraints and achieves the goal. Let me check if it can be made more optimal.

I actually think this is already quite optimized given the constraints. The plan moves efficiently through the rooms, picks up the necessary objects only once, and achieves all constraints with minimal actions.

So my final plan is:

1. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_1
2. pick blue_ball_1 room_1
3. gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_2
4. toggle red_door_1
5. gotoroom room_1 room_2 red_door_1
6. gotoempty
7. drop blue_ball_1 room_2
8. gotoobject green_ball_1 room_2
9. pick green_ball_1 room_2
10. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_4
11. toggle purple_door_1
12. gotoroom room_2 room_4 purple_door_1
13. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3
14. toggle grey_door_1  
15. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1
16. gotoempty
17. drop green_ball_1 room_3
18. gotoobject green_ball_2 room_3
19. pick green_ball_2 room_3
20. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4
21. gotoroom room_3 room_4 grey_door_1
22. gotoempty
23. drop green_ball_2 room_4
24. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_4
25. pick blue_box_1 room_4
26. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3
