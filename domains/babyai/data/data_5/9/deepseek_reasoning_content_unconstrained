Okay, let's try to figure out how to solve this planning problem. The goal is to be in front of a grey door that connects room_4 and room_3, which is unlocked. The door in question here is grey_door_1 because that's the one connecting those two rooms. So, the final state needs me to be in front of grey_door_1, which is unlocked.

First, I need to check the initial state. I'm in room_1. All doors are locked initially. The grey_door_1 connects room_3 and room_4. So, to get to grey_door_1, I need to reach either room_3 or room_4 and then go to that door. But all doors are locked, so I need to unlock them. However, unlocking a door requires being in front of it and toggling it. But to get in front of a door, I need to be in a room connected by that door and have no object blocking the position in front of it.

Looking at the objects in the rooms: room_1 has blue_ball_1. Room_2 has red_box_1 and green_ball_1. Room_3 has yellow_ball_1, blue_ball_2, green_ball_2, blue_ball_3. Room_4 has blue_box_1. So, doors might be blocked by these objects. For example, if a door's position is blocked by an object, I can't go to that door until the object is moved.

Wait, the preconditions for "goto door" say that there must be no object blocking the position in front of the door in the current room. So, if there's an object in front of the door in my current room, I can't go there. Therefore, I might need to move any objects blocking the doors.

But the initial problem is, all doors are locked. To unlock them, I need to toggle them, which requires being in front of them. But if the doors are locked, how do I get to them? Wait, noâ€”the "goto door" action only requires that the door is connecting the current room to another and that there's no object blocking the position. The door being locked doesn't prevent me from going in front of it. The "goto room" action requires the door to be unlocked to move through it, but "goto door" just requires being in the correct room and no blocking object.

So, for example, if I'm in room_1, and I want to go to red_door_1 (connecting room_1 and room_2), I can do that as long as there's no object blocking that position. But in room_1, there's blue_ball_1. Where is it located? The problem states the initial positions but not the exact positions relative to doors. Wait, the problem doesn't specify where exactly the objects are in the room, just which room they are in. So maybe the assumption is that objects are not blocking doors unless specified. Or perhaps all objects are blocking the door positions by default? Hmm, that's unclear.

But according to the problem's initial state, there's no mention of any door being blocked by an object. So perhaps all doors are unblocked initially. Then, I can go to any door in my current room as long as I'm in a room connected by that door.

Wait, but the initial state says that all doors are locked. So, for example, red_door_1 is locked, connecting room_1 and room_2. So, if I'm in room_1, can I go to red_door_1? Yes, if there's no object blocking it. Since room_1 has blue_ball_1, but if it's not in front of the door, then I can go. Assuming that objects are not blocking doors unless specified, which seems to be the case here because the initial state doesn't mention any blocking.

Therefore, the plan steps might involve:

1. From room_1, go to red_door_1 (connecting room_1 and room_2). But red_door_1 is locked. But to toggle it, I need to be in front of it. So, "goto door red_door_1 room_1 room_2", then "toggle red_door_1" to unlock it. Then, go through the door to room_2.

Wait, but the "goto door" action doesn't require the door to be unlocked. Only "goto room" does. So, steps could be:

- In room_1:
  - goto door red_door_1 room_1 room_2 (assuming no object blocking)
  - toggle red_door_1 (unlocks it)
  - gotoroom room_1 room_2 red_door_1 (now in room_2)
  
Once in room_2, maybe need to unlock purple_door_1 (connects room_2 and room_4). But purple_door_1 is locked. So:

- In room_2:
  - goto door purple_door_1 room_2 room_4
  - toggle purple_door_1 (unlock)
  - gotoroom room_2 room_4 purple_door_1 (now in room_4)
  
In room_4, the grey_door_1 connects to room_3. So:

- In room_4:
  - goto door grey_door_1 room_4 room_3
  - toggle grey_door_1 (unlock)
  - Now, the goal is to be in front of grey_door_1 (which is in room_4 and room_3), but the goal is to have d be grey, connect room_4 and room_3, be in front of d, and d is unlocked. So if I'm in room_4, after toggling, I can be in front of grey_door_1, which is now unlocked. Then that satisfies the goal.

Wait, but after toggling, the door is unlocked, and I'm in front of it. So maybe after the toggle, I'm already in front of it. So the plan would be:

1. From room_1, go to red_door_1.
2. Toggle red_door_1 (unlocks it)
3. Go to room_2 via red_door_1.
4. In room_2, go to purple_door_1.
5. Toggle purple_door_1 (unlocks)
6. Go to room_4 via purple_door_1.
7. In room_4, go to grey_door_1.
8. Toggle grey_door_1 (unlocks it)
9. Now, I'm in front of grey_door_1, which is unlocked. That meets the goal.

But wait, the problem's goal is to have a door d that is grey, connects room_4 and room_3, and I'm in front of it, and it's not locked. So grey_door_1 is the correct door. So steps would be as above.

But let's check the path:

Starting in room_1.

Action 1: gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_2. Preconditions: I'm in a room connected by red_door_1 (room_1 is connected to room_2 via red_door_1), and no object blocking. Assuming no blocking, this is possible.

Action 2: toggle red_door_1. Now red_door_1 is unlocked.

Action 3: gotoroom room_1 room_2 red_door_1. Now in room_2.

In room_2, need to go to purple_door_1 (connects room_2 and room_4). So:

Action 4: gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_4. Preconditions met (room_2 is connected via purple_door_1, no blocking objects). Then toggle purple_door_1 (action 5), unlocking it.

Action 6: gotoroom room_2 room_4 purple_door_1. Now in room_4.

In room_4, need to go to grey_door_1, which connects to room_3. So:

Action 7: gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3. Preconditions met.

Action 8: toggle grey_door_1. Now it's unlocked.

Now, after action 7, I'm in front of grey_door_1. Then after action 8, the door is unlocked. So the final state after action 8 is being in front of grey_door_1 (from room_4's side), and the door is unlocked. That satisfies the goal.

But wait, the toggle action's effect is to unlock if it was locked. So after action 8, the door is unlocked, and I'm still in front of it. So the final state is achieved. So the plan would be these 8 actions.

But let me check if there's a shorter path. For example, maybe going through room_3 instead.

Alternative path:

From room_1, go to green_door_1 (connecting room_1 and room_3). But green_door_1 is locked. So:

Action 1: gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3.

Action 2: toggle green_door_1 (unlock).

Action 3: gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1. Now in room_3.

In room_3, grey_door_1 connects to room_4. So:

Action 4: gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4.

Action 5: toggle grey_door_1 (unlock).

Now, after action 4, I'm in front of grey_door_1 from room_3's side. Toggling unlocks it. So the final state is being in front of grey_door_1, which is unlocked. But the goal requires that the door connects room_4 and room_3. The door does connect them, regardless of which side you're on. So this path is 5 actions, which is shorter. But wait, initial state: all doors are locked. So green_door_1 is locked. But the problem is, in room_1, there's blue_ball_1. Does that block the door? The problem states that objects are in the room, but not their exact positions. The "goto door" action requires that there's no object blocking the position in front of the door in the current room. If blue_ball_1 is in front of green_door_1 in room_1, then I can't go to green_door_1 until I move the ball.

But the problem description doesn't specify the positions of objects, only their rooms. So maybe the initial assumption is that objects are not blocking doors. So in that case, the path through room_3 is shorter. Let's check:

Option 1: Path through room_3 (room_1 -> room_3 -> room_4? Wait, no. To get to room_4 from room_3 via grey_door_1, but after unlocking, you can go to room_4. Wait, but the goal is to be in front of grey_door_1, which can be in room_3 or room_4. The problem says "you are in front of d". So if I'm in room_3, and I go to grey_door_1, then toggle it, then that satisfies the goal. So maybe this is a shorter path.

Let me outline:

1. gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3 (from room_1)
2. toggle green_door_1 (unlock)
3. gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1 (now in room_3)
4. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4
5. toggle grey_door_1 (unlock)

Now, after step 4, you're in front of grey_door_1 in room_3. After step 5, the door is unlocked, and you're still in front of it. So the goal is achieved. That's 5 actions. Which is shorter than the previous path of 8 actions. So this would be better.

But the problem is: is there any object blocking green_door_1 in room_1? Since blue_ball_1 is in room_1. If the ball is in front of the door, then step 1 (goto door green_door_1) would fail. But the problem doesn't state that, so we have to assume that the doors are not blocked by objects. Therefore, this path is possible.

So the optimal plan would be the 5-step path through room_3.

Wait, but let's check the initial state again. In room_3, there are several balls: yellow_ball_1, blue_ball_2, green_ball_2, blue_ball_3. Are any of these blocking grey_door_1 in room_3? Again, since the problem doesn't specify positions, we can assume they are not blocking. Therefore, gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4 is possible.

So the plan would be:

1. gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3
2. toggle green_door_1
3. gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1
4. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4
5. toggle grey_door_1

This gives the goal: grey_door_1 is grey (as per initial state, grey_door_1 is grey), connects room_4 and room_3, you are in front of it (after step 4, but after step 5 you're still in front of it, since toggle doesn't move you), and it's unlocked (after step 5). So this satisfies all the conditions.

But wait, in the initial state, grey_door_1 is locked. After step 5, it's unlocked. So the final state is achieved.

This plan is 5 steps. The other path through room_2 and room_4 is 8 steps. Therefore, the optimal plan is the 5-step one.

But I need to confirm that each action is possible. Let's check each step:

1. gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3: Are we in room_1 (yes), and green_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3 (yes). No object blocking (assumed yes). So possible.

2. toggle green_door_1: we are in front of it after step 1. So yes.

3. gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1: since green_door_1 is now unlocked, this is allowed. So we move to room_3.

4. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4: in room_3, grey_door_1 connects to room_4. No blocking assumed. Possible.

5. toggle grey_door_1: now in front of it. Toggle unlocks it.

Thus, the plan is valid. So the optimal plan is 5 steps.
