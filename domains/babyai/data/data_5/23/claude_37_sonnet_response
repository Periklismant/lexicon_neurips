Let me analyze this planning problem step by step. I need to develop a plan that will satisfy all the given constraints and achieve the goal.

First, let me understand the goal:
"There is a box v such that "The following conditions are all true: "v is yellow", "v is in room_1", "you are in room_1", "you are in front of v""

This means I need to be in room_1, with a yellow box in room_1, and I need to be in front of that yellow box.

Looking at the initial state, there are several yellow boxes:
- yellow_box_1 (in room_1)
- yellow_box_2 (in room_2)
- yellow_box_3 (in room_2)

The simplest approach would be to go to room_1 and stand in front of yellow_box_1, which is already there.

Now, let's address each constraint:

1. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: "At least one of the following conditions is true: "you are holding some object", "red_door_2 is not locked""
   This means at some point, I either need to hold an object or unlock red_door_2.

2. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: "red_door_2 is not locked""
   I must unlock red_door_2 at some point.

3. "The following expression must hold in every state: "red_door_1 is locked""
   I cannot unlock red_door_1 at any point.

4. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: "you are in front of yellow_ball_1""
   I need to stand in front of yellow_ball_1 at some point, which is in room_3.

5. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: "blue_door_1 is not locked""
   I need to unlock blue_door_1 at some point.

6. "If expression "blue_door_1 is not locked" holds in some state s, then expression "At least one of the following conditions is true: "green_ball_1 is in room_2", "you are in room_4"" must hold at s or at some state after s"
   After unlocking blue_door_1, either green_ball_1 must be in room_2 or I must be in room_4.

Let's consider the map layout:
- room_1 (NW) connected to room_2 (SW) via red_door_1
- room_1 (NW) connected to room_3 (NE) via red_door_2
- room_2 (SW) connected to room_4 (SE) via blue_door_1
- room_3 (NE) connected to room_4 (SE) via grey_door_1

Starting in room_4, I need to eventually reach room_1. Let's think about a possible path:

I could go:
room_4 -> room_3 (via grey_door_1) -> room_1 (via red_door_2)
or
room_4 -> room_2 (via blue_door_1) -> room_1 (via red_door_1)

However, constraint 3 says red_door_1 must remain locked, so I can't use that door. So I must go through room_3.

Initial state:
- I'm in room_4
- All doors are locked
- green_ball_1 is in room_4

Let's sketch a plan:

1. First, I need to unlock blue_door_1 (constraint 5)
2. After unlocking blue_door_1, either green_ball_1 must be in room_2 or I must be in room_4 (constraint 6)
3. I need to unlock grey_door_1 to go to room_3
4. In room_3, I need to stand in front of yellow_ball_1 (constraint 4)
5. I need to unlock red_door_2 (constraint 2) 
6. Go to room_1
7. Stand in front of yellow_box_1 (to satisfy the goal)

Let me think about how to satisfy constraint 6. I can either move green_ball_1 to room_2 or stay in room_4 after unlocking blue_door_1. Moving green_ball_1 to room_2 would require:
- Picking it up in room_4
- Going to room_2 via blue_door_1
- Dropping it in room_2

Now, let's create a detailed plan:

Starting in room_4:
1. Go to blue_door_1 connecting room_4 and room_2
2. Toggle blue_door_1 (now it's unlocked, satisfying constraint 5)
3. At this point, I'm in room_4, satisfying constraint 6
4. Go to grey_door_1 connecting room_4 and room_3
5. Toggle grey_door_1 (now it's unlocked)
6. Go to room_3 from room_4 via grey_door_1
7. Go to yellow_ball_1 in room_3 (satisfying constraint 4)
8. Go to red_door_2 connecting room_3 and room_1
9. Toggle red_door_2 (now it's unlocked, satisfying constraints 1 and 2)
10. Go to room_1 from room_3 via red_door_2
11. Go to yellow_box_1 in room_1 (satisfying the goal)

Let me now formalize this into the required action format:

```
gotodoor blue_door_1 room_4 room_2
toggle blue_door_1
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3
toggle grey_door_1
gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1
gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_3
gotodoor red_door_2 room_3 room_1
toggle red_door_2
gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_2
gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_1
```

Let's check if this plan meets all constraints:

1. "At some point, either you are holding an object or red_door_2 is unlocked"
   - We unlock red_door_2, satisfying this constraint.

2. "At some point, red_door_2 is unlocked"
   - We unlock red_door_2, satisfying this constraint.

3. "red_door_1 is always locked"
   - We never toggle red_door_1, satisfying this constraint.

4. "At some point, you are in front of yellow_ball_1"
   - We go in front of yellow_ball_1 in room_3, satisfying this constraint.

5. "At some point, blue_door_1 is unlocked"
   - We unlock blue_door_1, satisfying this constraint.

6. "After blue_door_1 is unlocked, either green_ball_1 is in room_2 or you are in room_4"
   - After unlocking blue_door_1, we're still in room_4, satisfying this constraint.

The plan also achieves the goal of being in room_1, in front of yellow_box_1, which is a yellow box in room_1.

This plan seems valid and should fulfill all constraints. But there may be a shorter plan. Let me think if we can optimize it.

Actually, I think this plan is quite minimal for meeting all the constraints. We need to unlock certain doors, visit specific objects, and end at a specific location, which are all included in the plan. I don't see obvious redundant steps.

The final plan is:

```
gotodoor blue_door_1 room_4 room_2
toggle blue_door_1
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3
toggle grey_door_1
gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1
gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_3
gotodoor red_door_2 room_3 room_1
toggle red_door_2
gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_2
gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_1
```
