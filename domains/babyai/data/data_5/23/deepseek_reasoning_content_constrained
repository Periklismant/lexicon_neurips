Okay, let's tackle this planning problem step by step. The goal is to end up in room_1 in front of a yellow box that's also in room_1. The constraints add some complexity, so I need to make sure each one is satisfied.

First, the initial state: I'm in room_4. The yellow boxes are in room_1 (yellow_box_1) and room_2 (yellow_box_2, yellow_box_3). The final goal needs a yellow box in room_1, which is already satisfied by yellow_box_1. But I need to be in room_1 in front of it. So maybe I just need to go to room_1 and position myself in front of yellow_box_1. But how?

But wait, all doors are locked initially. So I need to unlock doors to move between rooms. Let's look at the doors. The doors connecting rooms are:

- red_door_1 connects room_1 and room_2.
- red_door_2 connects room_1 and room_3.
- blue_door_1 connects room_2 and room_4.
- grey_door_1 connects room_3 and room_4.

I'm starting in room_4. From room_4, I can go to room_2 via blue_door_1 or to room_3 via grey_door_1. But all doors are locked, so first, I need to unlock them. But the constraints mention that red_door_1 must remain locked in every state. So I can't unlock red_door_1. So that's a constraint to remember.

The constraints:

1. At least one state must have me holding an object OR red_door_2 unlocked. Also, another constraint requires that red_door_2 is unlocked in at least one state. So unlocking red_door_2 is necessary.

2. The constraint that in every state, red_door_1 is locked. So we can never unlock red_door_1. So movement between room_1 and room_2 via red_door_1 is impossible because it's locked, and we can't unlock it.

3. Must be in front of yellow_ball_1 at least once. yellow_ball_1 is in room_3 initially.

4. blue_door_1 must be unlocked in at least one state. But whenever blue_door_1 is unlocked, either green_ball_1 is in room_2 or I'm in room_4 at that state or later.

Let's outline the steps needed:

To get to room_1, starting from room_4. Let's see possible paths:

From room_4, possible doors are blue_door_1 (to room_2) and grey_door_1 (to room_3). Both are locked. So first, I need to unlock one of these doors. Let's think about which path is better.

If I unlock grey_door_1 (grey), then go to room_3. From room_3, I can use red_door_2 to get to room_1. But red_door_2 is locked. So I need to unlock red_door_2. But the constraint requires that red_door_2 must be unlocked in at least one state. So that's necessary.

Alternatively, unlock blue_door_1 (blue), go to room_2. Then from room_2, the red_door_1 connects to room_1, but that's locked and can't be unlocked. So that's a dead end. So the path via room_3 seems better.

So plan steps:

1. Unlock grey_door_1 (from room_4). To do that, I need to be in front of it. So first, gotoempty in room_4 to get in front of an empty spot. Then gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3. Wait, but to go to the door, I need to be in a room connected by the door. Since I'm in room_4, grey_door_1 connects room_4 and room_3. So I can go to the door. But the door is locked. So after going to the door, toggle it to unlock.

Wait, the preconditions for gotodoor: you must be in a room connected by the door, and no object is blocking the position in front of the door. The initial state doesn't mention any objects blocking doors, except maybe boxes or balls. Let me check the initial positions. In room_4, there's red_box_1, yellow_ball_2, green_ball_1. Are any of them blocking doors? The doors are between rooms, but the objects are in the rooms. Unless the problem states that objects can block doors. The effect of pick mentions that if x was blocking a door, it's no longer blocking. So I think objects can block doors. But the initial state doesn't mention any objects blocking doors. So maybe the doors are not blocked by objects. So the path is clear.

So steps:

From room_4:

- gotoempty (to get in front of empty spot, but maybe not necessary. Wait, the initial position: the agent is in room_4 but not in front of any object. So maybe the initial state has the agent not in front of anything. So to perform gotodoor, I can go directly.

Wait, the initial state says "you are in room_4" and "you are not holding any object". It doesn't mention being in front of anything. So the agent is in room_4 but not in front of any object or door. So to go to a door, the first step is gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3. But the preconditions for gotodoor require that (i) the agent is in a room connected by the door, which is true (room_4), and (ii) no object is blocking the position in front of d in the current room. Since no objects are blocking, that's okay. So:

1. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3

Then toggle grey_door_1 to unlock it. Because it's initially locked. Toggle requires being in front of the door. So:

2. toggle grey_door_1

Now grey_door_1 is unlocked. Then go to room_3:

3. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1

Now in room_3. yellow_ball_1 is here. We need to be in front of it at some point. Let's handle that now.

4. gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_3

This satisfies the constraint of being in front of yellow_ball_1 in some state.

Next, need to unlock red_door_2, which connects room_1 and room_3. To get there, need to go to red_door_2 from room_3. So:

5. gotodoor red_door_2 room_3 room_1

Then toggle it:

6. toggle red_door_2 (unlocking it)

Now red_door_2 is unlocked. Now can go to room_1:

7. gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_2

Now in room_1. The yellow_box_1 is here. Need to be in front of it. Since we're in room_1:

8. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_1

Now the goal is achieved: in room_1, in front of a yellow box (yellow_box_1), which is in room_1. But need to check constraints.

Wait, the constraints also include:

- The blue_door_1 must be unlocked in at least one state. But in the current steps, we didn't unlock blue_door_1. So that's a problem. So we need to ensure that blue_door_1 is unlocked at some point.

But how? Since the agent is in room_1 now. To unlock blue_door_1 (which connects room_2 and room_4), the agent would need to get to room_2 or room_4 and toggle it. But room_1 is connected to room_3 and room_2 (via red_door_1, which is locked and can't be unlocked). So from room_1, the only way out is back to room_3 via red_door_2. Then perhaps from room_3 to room_4 via grey_door_1, then to room_4, then go to blue_door_1, unlock it, but then the constraint says that if blue_door_1 is unlocked, either green_ball_1 is in room_2 or the agent is in room_4 at that state or later. So if we unlock blue_door_1 while in room_4, then the agent is in room_4, which satisfies the condition. So let's adjust the plan.

So after step 8, maybe we need to backtrack to room_4, unlock blue_door_1, and then maybe go back. But this would add steps. But the plan needs to be optimal. Let's think.

Alternative approach: Maybe during the initial path from room_4 to room_3 to room_1, we can also unlock blue_door_1. But how?

Wait, the initial steps would be:

From room_4, unlock grey_door_1, go to room_3. Then unlock red_door_2, go to room_1. But blue_door_1 is in room_4 and room_2. To unlock it, the agent must be in room_4 or room_2. But in the initial steps, the agent is moving from room_4 to room_3, then to room_1. Maybe after reaching room_1, the agent needs to go back to room_4 via room_3, then unlock blue_door_1.

But how to get to blue_door_1 from room_4. Let's see:

After step 7 (in room_1), steps would be:

8. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_1 (current position)

But we need to unlock blue_door_1. So after step 8, maybe go back to room_3, then to room_4, then go to blue_door_1, unlock it. But this adds steps. But since the problem requires an optimal plan, perhaps there's a way to do this more efficiently.

Alternatively, after unlocking grey_door_1 and going to room_3, maybe the agent can go back to room_4, unlock blue_door_1, then proceed to room_3 again. But that might not be optimal.

Let's outline:

Original steps up to step 7:

1. gotodoor grey_door_1 room4 room3
2. toggle grey_door_1
3. gotoroom room4 room3 grey_door_1
4. gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room3
5. gotodoor red_door_2 room3 room1
6. toggle red_door_2
7. gotoroom room3 room1 red_door_2
8. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room1 (goal met)

But we're missing the blue_door_1 unlock. So after step 7, to unlock blue_door_1, the agent needs to go back to room3, then room4, then unlock blue_door_1.

But this would involve:

After step 7, in room1:

- gotoempty (to not be in front of yellow_box_1)
- gotodoor red_door_2 room1 room3
- toggle red_door_2 (locking it again? But the constraint says that red_door_2 must be unlocked in at least one state. But we already have step 6 where it was unlocked, so that's satisfied. However, if we lock it again, does that affect anything? The constraint is that in at least one state, red_door_2 is unlocked. As long as step 6 exists, that's okay. But after unlocking it, moving through it requires it to be unlocked. So after step 7, to go back to room3, the door is unlocked. So:

9. gotoroom room1 room3 red_door_2 (now back in room3)
10. gotoroom room3 room4 grey_door_1 (since grey_door_1 is already unlocked)
11. gotodoor blue_door_1 room4 room2
12. toggle blue_door_1 (unlocking it)
13. (Now, blue_door_1 is unlocked. At this state, the agent is in room4. So the condition for the constraint is met (you are in room4 when blue_door_1 is unlocked, which satisfies the "you are in room4" part. So that's okay.)

But this adds several steps. However, the problem requires an optimal plan. Is there a shorter way?

Alternatively, after step 3 (in room3), perhaps go back to room4 to unlock blue_door_1 before proceeding to room1. Let's see:

Original step 3: in room3.

4. gotoroom room3 room4 grey_door_1 (back to room4)
5. gotodoor blue_door_1 room4 room2
6. toggle blue_door_1 (unlock)
7. gotoroom room4 room3 grey_door_1 (back to room3)
8. gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room3 (satisfy the constraint)
9. gotodoor red_door_2 room3 room1
10. toggle red_door_2 (unlock)
11. gotoroom room3 room1 red_door_2
12. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room1 (goal)

This way, blue_door_1 is unlocked in step6, and at that moment, the agent is in room4, which satisfies the constraint that if blue_door_1 is unlocked, either green_ball_1 is in room2 or agent is in room4. Since agent is in room4 during step6, it's okay. But green_ball_1 is in room4 in the initial state, and hasn't been moved, so it's still in room4. So the constraint is met.

This approach adds steps but is necessary to unlock blue_door_1. Let's count steps:

Original plan (without blue unlock) had 8 steps. This adjusted plan would have 12 steps. But maybe there's a more optimal path.

Wait, let's think differently. Can we unlock blue_door_1 first before going to room3?

Starting in room4:

1. gotodoor blue_door_1 room4 room2
But is the blue_door_1 accessible from room4? Yes, since it connects room4 and room2. So:

1. gotodoor blue_door_1 room4 room2
2. toggle blue_door_1 (unlocks it)
Now, blue_door_1 is unlocked. At this state, the agent is in room4. So the constraint is satisfied.

Then, proceed to unlock grey_door_1:

3. gotodoor grey_door_1 room4 room3
4. toggle grey_door_1
5. gotoroom room4 room3 grey_door_1
6. gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room3 (constraint)
7. gotodoor red_door_2 room3 room1
8. toggle red_door_2 (unlock)
9. gotoroom room3 room1 red_door_2
10. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room1 (goal)

This plan has 10 steps. But does this work?

Wait, after step 2, blue_door_1 is unlocked. At step 2, the agent is in front of blue_door_1 in room4. Then steps 3-4: go to grey_door_1 and unlock it. Then proceed as before. This would satisfy the blue_door_1 unlock constraint because in step2, the agent is in room4, so the condition holds. Also, the blue_door_1 is unlocked in step2, which satisfies the constraint that blue_door_1 is not locked in at least one state.

This seems more optimal. Let's check the constraints:

- The first constraint: in at least one state, holding an object OR red_door_2 is unlocked. Since red_door_2 is unlocked in step8, that's covered.

- The second constraint: red_door_2 must be unlocked in at least one state. Step8 does that.

- Third: red_door_1 is locked in every state. Since we never touch red_door_1, which is initially locked, and no action toggles it, so that's okay.

- Fourth: in front of yellow_ball_1. Step6.

- Fifth: blue_door_1 unlocked in step2. And in step2, agent is in room4, which satisfies the conditional constraint (since "you are in room_4" at that state).

This plan seems to meet all constraints with fewer steps. So this is better.

Let's write out the steps:

1. gotodoor blue_door_1 room4 room2
2. toggle blue_door_1
3. gotodoor grey_door_1 room4 room3
4. toggle grey_door_1
5. gotoroom room4 room3 grey_door_1
6. gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room3
7. gotodoor red_door_2 room3 room1
8. toggle red_door_2
9. gotoroom room3 room1 red_door_2
10. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room1

This plan has 10 steps. Let's verify each step's preconditions:

1. gotodoor blue_door_1 room4 room2: Agent is in room4, which is connected via blue_door_1. No object blocking door. Valid.

2. toggle blue_door_1: Agent is in front of blue_door_1. Valid. Now blue_door_1 is unlocked.

3. gotodoor grey_door_1 room4 room3: Agent is in room4. Valid. No object blocking.

4. toggle grey_door_1: Agent in front. Unlock it.

5. gotoroom room4 room3 grey_door_1: Door is unlocked. Valid.

6. gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room3: Agent in room3. Valid.

7. gotodoor red_door_2 room3 room1: Agent in room3. Valid.

8. toggle red_door_2: Unlock it.

9. gotoroom room3 room1 red_door_2: Door is unlocked. Valid.

10. gotoobject yellow_box_1 room1: Agent in room1. Valid.

All steps seem valid.

Now, check constraints:

- Constraint 1: At least one state with holding object OR red_door_2 unlocked. Step8 unlocks red_door_2. So satisfied.

- Constraint 2: red_door_2 must be unlocked in at least one state. Step8.

- Constraint3: red_door_1 remains locked always. We never touch it. Good.

- Constraint4: Be in front of yellow_ball_1. Step6.

- Constraint5: blue_door_1 unlocked in step2. At that time, agent is in room4, so the conditional holds (you are in room4). So when blue_door_1 is unlocked, the agent is in room4, satisfying the requirement.

Yes, all constraints are met.

Now, let's count the steps. This is 10 steps. Is there a way to make it shorter?

Alternative approach: After unlocking blue_door_1 in step2, could the agent use blue_door_1 to go to room2, but then from room2, can't go to room1 because red_door_1 is locked. So that's not helpful. So the initial approach seems best.

Thus, the optimal plan is 10 steps.
