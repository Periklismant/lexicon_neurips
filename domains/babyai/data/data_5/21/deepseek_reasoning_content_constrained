Okay, let's tackle this planning problem step by step. First, I need to understand the initial state, the goal, and the constraints. 

The initial state has the agent in room_1. The goal is to have a red ball in room_4, with the agent in room_4 and in front of that ball. The red_ball_1 is already in room_4, so maybe the main challenge is getting to room_4 and being in front of it, while satisfying all constraints.

Constraints are a bit tricky. Let's list them:

1. At some point, red_door_1 must be unlocked.
2. Never be in room_2.
3. At some point, be in front of purple_door_2.
4. If in front of purple_door_2, then either be in room_3 or holding something at that state or later.
5. Yellow_door_1 must be unlocked at some point.
6. At some state, both holding an object and red_door_1 is unlocked.

So, the agent can't enter room_2 at all. Let's check the doors. The doors connecting the rooms:

- room_1 connects to room_2 (purple_door_1) and room_3 (red_door_1). But room_2 is off-limits, so the agent can't use purple_door_1. So, the only way from room_1 is through red_door_1 to room_3. But red_door_1 is initially locked. So the agent needs to unlock it. However, to toggle a door, the agent must be in front of it. So the agent needs to go to red_door_1 in room_1, unlock it, then go to room_3.

Wait, but red_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3. So to toggle it, the agent must be in front of it in room_1. Then, after unlocking, can go to room_3. Then, from room_3, the agent can go to room_4 via yellow_door_1 (which is also locked), or maybe other doors. But the other door from room_3 is red_door_1 (back to room_1), and from room_4, there's purple_door_2 (connecting to room_2, which is forbidden) and yellow_door_1 (connecting to room_3). 

So the path would need to be room_1 -> room_3 (after unlocking red_door_1), then room_3 to room_4 via yellow_door_1. But yellow_door_1 is locked, so need to unlock that. However, to unlock yellow_door_1, the agent must be in front of it. But yellow_door_1 is in room_3 and room_4. So the agent needs to be in room_3 to toggle it. Wait, but when you're in room_3, the door yellow_door_1 connects to room_4. So to toggle it, the agent must be in front of yellow_door_1 in room_3.

But maybe the agent can go to room_3, go to the yellow door, unlock it, then go through to room_4. But in that case, the agent would need to be in front of the yellow door in room_3. However, there's a constraint that at some point, the agent must be in front of purple_door_2. Purple_door_2 connects room_2 and room_4. Since room_2 is forbidden, the agent can't be there. So the only way to be in front of purple_door_2 is from room_4. But how does the agent get to room_4 without passing through room_2? The path would be room_1 -> room_3 -> room_4 via yellow_door_1. But to do that, the agent needs to unlock yellow_door_1. So let's outline the steps.

First, the agent is in room_1. The red_door_1 is locked. So the agent needs to go to red_door_1, toggle it to unlock. Then go to room_3. Then go to yellow_door_1 in room_3, unlock it. Then go to room_4. But in room_4, there's purple_door_2, which connects to room_2. The agent needs to be in front of purple_door_2 at some point, but can't enter room_2. So perhaps the agent goes to purple_door_2 from room_4. But being in front of purple_door_2 in room_4 would require that there's no object blocking it. Are there any objects blocking doors? The initial state doesn't mention any objects blocking doors, except maybe boxes or balls. Let me check the initial state.

The initial objects: purple_box_1 is in room_2. Balls in room_1 (blue_ball_1), room_3 has several balls, room_4 has red_ball_1 and yellow_ball_1. So unless an object is in front of a door, which blocks it. The problem says that when you "goto door", you can only do so if there's no object blocking the position in front of d in your current room. The initial state doesn't mention any objects blocking doors, so perhaps all doors are unblocked. So the agent can go to any door as long as they are in the correct room.

So, the steps:

1. In room_1, go to red_door_1 (room_1 and room_3). Then toggle it to unlock. This satisfies constraint 1 (red_door_1 is not locked in some state). Then, go to room_3 via red_door_1.

Once in room_3, need to unlock yellow_door_1. So:

2. In room_3, go to yellow_door_1 (connecting to room_4). Toggle it to unlock (satisfies constraint 5). Then go to room_4.

Now, in room_4, the agent needs to be in front of a red ball (red_ball_1 is there). But the goal requires the agent to be in room_4, in front of a red ball. So maybe just go to red_ball_1 in room_4 and drop it if needed. Wait, the red_ball_1 is already in room_4. So the agent just needs to be in front of it. But how? The agent can use "gotoobject red_ball_1 room_4". But the agent is in room_4 after entering from room_3. So:

3. In room_4, gotoobject red_ball_1 room_4. Then the goal is achieved.

But wait, the agent might need to pick or drop something? The goal is just to have the agent in room_4, in front of a red ball that's in room_4. Since red_ball_1 is already there, just moving in front of it should suffice. However, there are other constraints to meet.

Now, the constraints:

- Must be in front of purple_door_2 at some point. Purple_door_2 is in room_2 and room_4. Since the agent can't go to room_2, they must go to purple_door_2 from room_4. So after arriving in room_4, the agent can go to purple_door_2 (room_4 and room_2). But that's allowed as long as they don't enter room_2. So after step 3, perhaps:

4. In room_4, gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_2. Then, the agent is in front of purple_door_2, satisfying constraint 3. But then, according to constraint 4, if in front of purple_door_2, the agent must either be in room_3 (which they aren't) or be holding something. So after being in front of purple_door_2, the agent must pick up an object. But in room_4, there's red_ball_1 and yellow_ball_1. So the agent can pick one of them. But the agent is already in front of red_ball_1 (from step 3). Wait, maybe the sequence is different. Let me think again.

Wait, the agent might need to go to purple_door_2 in room_4. So after entering room_4 via yellow_door_1, the agent can first go to purple_door_2 (gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_2). Then, to satisfy constraint 4, they must either be in room_3 (which they aren't) or be holding something. So perhaps after being in front of purple_door_2, they need to pick up an object. But to pick up, they need to be in front of the object. So perhaps:

After entering room_4, go to purple_door_2 (gotodoor), then go to red_ball_1 (gotoobject), pick it up. But then, when in front of purple_door_2, they are not holding anything yet, so they need to hold something either at that state or after. So maybe, after being in front of purple_door_2, they go to red_ball_1, pick it up. Then the constraint is satisfied because after being in front of purple_door_2, they are holding an object. Alternatively, perhaps when they are in front of purple_door_2, they can pick up an object if one is there. But in room_4, the objects are in the room, not necessarily in front of the door. So the agent would need to first goto purple_door_2, then goto the object, pick it up. So the sequence would be:

In room_4:

- gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_2 (satisfies constraint 3)
- then gotoempty (to leave the door)
- then gotoobject red_ball_1 room_4
- pick red_ball_1 room_4

But picking up the ball would require being in front of it. Alternatively, after being in front of purple_door_2, the agent can go to the ball and pick it up, thereby holding an object after that state. So the constraint is satisfied because after being in front of the door, they hold an object.

Also, there's constraint 6: At some state, the agent must be holding an object and red_door_1 is unlocked. Since red_door_1 is unlocked when the agent toggled it earlier, and if the agent picks up an object (like blue_ball_1 in room_1, but that's in room_1. Wait, the agent is in room_4. So maybe pick up red_ball_1 in room_4. Then, that satisfies holding an object. But when is red_door_1 unlocked? It was unlocked in room_1 when the agent toggled it. So the state where the agent is holding red_ball_1 and red_door_1 is unlocked (since it was toggled earlier) would satisfy constraint 6. Because the agent just needs that in some state, both conditions hold. Since red_door_1 remains unlocked after being toggled (unless locked again), the agent can be holding the red_ball_1 in room_4, and red_door_1 is still unlocked. So that's okay.

So the plan outline is:

1. In room_1, go to red_door_1 (gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3)
2. Toggle red_door_1 (unlock it)
3. Gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1 (move to room_3)
4. In room_3, go to yellow_door_1 (gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_4)
5. Toggle yellow_door_1 (unlock it)
6. Gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_1 (move to room_4)
7. In room_4, go to purple_door_2 (gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_2) [satisfies constraint 3]
8. Then, go to red_ball_1 (gotoobject red_ball_1 room_4)
9. Pick red_ball_1 room_4 [now holding it, which helps with constraint 4 and 6]
10. Then drop it again? Wait, no. The goal requires the agent to be in front of the red ball in room_4. If they pick it up, they are no longer in front of it. So maybe instead of picking it up, they just need to be in front of it. But the problem says the goal is "there is a ball v such that v is red, in room_4, you are in room_4, and in front of v." Since red_ball_1 is already in room_4, the agent just needs to be in front of it. So step 8 would achieve that. But then, after step 7 (being in front of purple_door_2), the agent needs to either be in room_3 (no) or holding something (not yet). So after step 7, the agent must pick up an object. But in room_4, the objects are red_ball_1 and yellow_ball_1. So after step 7:

7. gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_2
8. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_4 (this requires being in room_4, which they are)
9. pick red_ball_1 room_4 (now holding it, which satisfies constraint 4)
10. Then drop it? But dropping requires being in front of an empty position. If they are in front of red_ball_1, they can't drop there. So after picking, they need to gotoempty, then drop. But the goal requires being in front of the red ball. So maybe:

Alternatively:

After step 6 (in room_4), first goto purple_door_2 (step 7). Then, to satisfy constraint 4, they need to hold something. So after step 7, they go to red_ball_1 (step 8), pick it up (step 9). Now, they are holding it. Then, they need to drop it in room_4 to be in front of it again. But dropping requires being in front of an empty position. So they need to gotoempty (step 10), then drop (step 11). Then gotoobject again (step 12). But that's more steps, but maybe necessary.

Alternatively, after picking up the red_ball_1, they can drop it in front of themselves. Wait, the "drop" action requires that the position in front is empty. So after picking, they are no longer in front of the ball. So to drop it, they need to be in front of an empty spot. So perhaps:

After picking the red_ball_1 (step 9), they do gotoempty (step 10), then drop it (step 11). Then, gotoobject red_ball_1 (step 12) to be in front of it. But this adds more steps. However, the goal is to be in front of the ball, so step 12 would satisfy that.

But the problem requires an optimal plan (shortest possible). So maybe there's a better way. Let's see.

Wait, perhaps after step 7 (in front of purple_door_2), the agent can pick up an object in room_4. But how? They need to be in front of the object to pick it up. So after step 7, the agent is in front of purple_door_2. Then, they need to go to the object (red_ball_1), pick it up. Then, that satisfies holding an object after being in front of purple_door_2. So steps:

7. gotodoor purple_door_2 room4 room2
8. gotoobject red_ball_1 room4
9. pick red_ball_1 room4 (now holding it)
10. Now, to be in front of it again, need to drop it. But to drop, they need to be in front of an empty spot. So gotoempty (step 10), then drop (step 11). Then gotoobject red_ball_1 (step 12). But that's three steps. Alternatively, maybe after picking it up, they can drop it immediately. Wait, no. To drop, they need to be in front of an empty position. So after picking, they are not in front of anything. So they need to go to an empty spot, drop, then go back to the object.

Alternatively, maybe after being in front of purple_door_2 (step7), they can go to yellow_ball_1, pick it up. Then, they are holding something. Then, proceed to drop it somewhere, but the goal is to have the red ball in room4. But the red ball is already there. So maybe the steps can be optimized.

Wait, the goal doesn't require the agent to drop the ball, just to be in front of it. So if the agent is holding the red ball, then they are not in front of it. So they need to drop it in room4. So the sequence would be:

After step 6 (in room4):

7. gotodoor purple_door_2 room4 room2 (step7)
8. gotoempty (step8)
9. gotoobject red_ball_1 room4 (step9)
10. pick red_ball_1 room4 (step10)
11. gotoempty (step11)
12. drop red_ball_1 room4 (step12)
13. gotoobject red_ball_1 room4 (step13)

But that's a lot of steps. Alternatively, maybe after picking up the red_ball_1, the agent can drop it in front of themselves. Wait, the drop action puts the object in front of the agent. So after picking up the ball, if the agent is in front of an empty spot, they can drop it there. Then, they can go to the dropped ball. But how?

Let me re-examine the drop effect: "you are in front of x" after dropping. Wait, the effect of drop is: (i) you are no longer carrying x, (ii) you are in front of x, (iii) hands empty, (iv) x is in the current room. So when you drop x, you end up in front of x. So if you are in an empty position and drop x, you will be in front of x. Wait, no. The preconditions for drop: you must be holding x, and the position in front of you is empty. The effect is that you drop x in front of you, and you are now in front of x. Wait, no. Let me check the drop effect again:

Effect of "drop x r": 

(i) you are no longer carrying x

(ii) you are in front of x

(iii) your hands are empty

(iv) x is in the room you are currently in.

So when you drop x, you place it in front of you, and then you are in front of x. So if you are in an empty spot and drop x, you place x there and are now in front of it. So if the agent is in front of an empty spot, drops x, then they are now in front of x. So to achieve the goal, maybe the agent can do:

In room4:

- gotoempty (step7)

- drop red_ball_1 room4 (but they need to be holding it first)

Wait, but they need to pick it up first. So:

After entering room4:

1. gotoobject red_ball_1 room4 (step6)

But wait, after entering room4 via yellow_door_1, they are in room4 but not in front of anything. So steps in room4:

6. gotoroom room3 room4 yellow_door_1 (now in room4)

7. gotoobject red_ball_1 room4 (step7)

Now in front of red_ball_1. But the goal is to be in room4 and in front of red_ball_1. So this would satisfy the goal. However, we need to satisfy all constraints.

But let's check the constraints again. The constraints are:

1. red_door_1 unlocked at some state.

We do that when we toggle it in room1.

2. Never be in room2. So our path doesn't go there.

3. Be in front of purple_door_2 at some point. So steps needed to go to purple_door_2 in room4.

4. If in front of purple_door_2, then either in room3 or holding something now or later.

5. yellow_door_1 must be unlocked at some point. We do that when we toggle it in room3.

6. At some state, hold an object and red_door_1 is unlocked.

So the current plan outline is:

room1 -> toggle red_door_1, go to room3 -> toggle yellow_door_1, go to room4 -> goto purple_door_2 (satisfy constraint3) -> then go to red_ball_1 and be in front of it.

But when in front of purple_door_2 (step in room4), constraint4 requires that the agent is in room3 (no) or holds something now or later. So after being in front of purple_door_2, the agent must pick up something. So after step where agent is in front of purple_door_2, they need to hold something either then or later. So maybe:

After entering room4:

6. gotodoor purple_door_2 room4 room2 (step6)

7. Then gotoobject red_ball_1 room4 (step7)

8. pick red_ball_1 room4 (step8)

Now, step6: in front of purple_door_2. Then step7 and 8: agent moves to red_ball_1 and picks it up. So after step6, the agent is not holding anything, but later in step8 they are. So constraint4 is satisfied because after being in front of purple_door_2, they eventually hold something.

Then, after picking up red_ball_1, the agent needs to drop it to be in front of it again. Because the goal requires being in front of it. But when you pick it up, you are no longer in front of it. So after step8, the agent is holding it. Then, they need to drop it. To drop, they need to be in front of an empty position. So:

9. gotoempty (step9)

10. drop red_ball_1 room4 (step10)

Now, after dropping, the agent is in front of red_ball_1 (due to drop effect). So this satisfies the goal: in room4, in front of red_ball_1, which is in room4. So step10 would be the last action.

Now, let's check all constraints:

- Constraint1: red_door_1 is unlocked (step2). Satisfied.

- Constraint2: never in room2. All steps avoid room2.

- Constraint3: in front of purple_door_2 (step6). Satisfied.

- Constraint4: when in front of purple_door_2 (step6), later holds an object (step8). Satisfied.

- Constraint5: yellow_door_1 is unlocked (step5). Satisfied.

- Constraint6: at some state, holding an object and red_door_1 is unlocked. After step8, the agent is holding red_ball_1. red_door_1 was unlocked in step2 and remains unlocked. So step8 is the state where both hold. Satisfied.

So the plan would be:

1. gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3

2. toggle red_door_1

3. gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1

4. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_4

5. toggle yellow_door_1

6. gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_1

7. gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_2

8. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_4

9. pick red_ball_1 room_4

10. gotoempty

11. drop red_ball_1 room_4

Wait, but after step11 (drop), the agent is in front of red_ball_1, which meets the goal. However, step11 is "drop", which requires being in front of an empty position. So before dropping, the agent must be in front of an empty spot. So after step9 (pick), the agent is not in front of anything. So step10: gotoempty. Then step11: drop. After dropping, they are in front of red_ball_1. So steps 10 and 11 are necessary.

But can this plan be shortened? Let's see. The steps are:

1. goto red_door_1 in room1

2. toggle (unlock)

3. move to room3

4. goto yellow_door_1 in room3

5. toggle (unlock)

6. move to room4

7. goto purple_door_2 in room4

8. goto red_ball_1

9. pick it up

10. goto empty spot

11. drop it (now in front of it)

That's 11 steps. But maybe some steps can be merged. For example, after step7 (in front of purple_door_2), can the agent go directly to the red_ball_1 and pick it up, then drop it. But according to the drop effect, after dropping, they are in front of the ball. So steps:

After step6 (in room4):

7. gotodoor purple_door_2 room4 room2 (satisfies constraint3)

8. gotoobject red_ball_1 room4

9. pick red_ball_1 room4

10. gotoempty

11. drop red_ball_1 room4

That's 11 steps. Is there a way to avoid some steps?

Alternatively, after step7 (purple_door_2), go to an empty spot, drop any object there. But the agent hasn't picked up anything yet. Wait, the agent can't drop without holding.

Another angle: constraint6 requires that at some state, the agent is holding an object and red_door_1 is unlocked. In the current plan, step9 (pick red_ball_1) is when the agent is holding it, and red_door_1 was unlocked in step2. So that state satisfies constraint6. So that's covered.

Now, can we avoid the gotoempty and drop steps? Let me think. If after picking up the ball, the agent can drop it immediately. But the preconditions for drop are: holding the object and in front of an empty position. So after picking up the ball (step9), the agent is no longer in front of the ball. They are in front of where the ball was, but after picking, the ball is no longer there. Wait, no. The effect of pick is that you are no longer in front of x, and x is no longer in the room. Wait, no. The pick effect says:

After pick x r:

(i) you are no longer in front of x

(ii) hands not empty

(iii) carrying x

(iv) x is no longer in the room

(v) if x was blocking a door, it's unblocked.

Wait, but in the initial state, the red_ball_1 is in room4. If the agent picks it up, then red_ball_1 is no longer in room4. But the goal requires that the ball is in room4. So picking it up and then dropping it back would be necessary. But according to the problem statement, the goal is to have a red ball in room4. The initial state already has red_ball_1 in room4. So picking it up removes it from room4, which would violate the goal. Wait, this is a problem!

Oh wait, the goal is that "there is a ball v such that v is red, in room4, you are in room4, and in front of v." So if the agent picks up red_ball_1, takes it out of room4, then drops it back in room4, then it's still in room4. But during the plan, the ball is temporarily not in room4. But the goal is the final state. So as long as in the end, the ball is in room4 and the agent is in front of it, it's okay. But when the agent picks up the ball, they take it out of the room. Then when they drop it, it's placed back in the room. So the final state would have the ball in room4. So this is acceptable.

But in the current plan, after step9, the agent picks up red_ball_1, which removes it from room4. Then, when they drop it in step11, it's placed back in room4. So the final state has the ball in room4. So that's okay.

But this means that steps 9-11 are necessary. So the plan length is 11 actions. But maybe there's a shorter way. Let's think.

Is there a way to avoid moving to purple_door_2 and instead use another path? For example, after unlocking yellow_door_1, go to room4, then immediately go to purple_door_2. But that's already in the plan.

Alternative approach: When in room4, after arriving, first go to purple_door_2, then go to red_ball_1, pick it up, drop it, then be in front of it. But the problem is the same.

Wait, maybe the agent doesn't need to drop the ball. If the goal is to be in front of the ball, which is in room4, and the ball is already there, then maybe the agent can just go to the ball without picking it up. But in that case, when do they satisfy constraint4 (after being in front of purple_door_2, they must hold something). So if they go to purple_door_2, then go to the ball, but don't pick it up, then constraint4 isn't satisfied. So they need to pick up something.

Alternatively, pick up another ball, like yellow_ball_1. But then the agent has to drop it somewhere. But the goal requires being in front of a red ball, so that's okay.

Wait, but the goal is to be in front of any red ball in room4. Since red_ball_1 is already there, the agent can just be in front of it. But according to the constraints, after being in front of purple_door_2, the agent must hold something. So the agent needs to pick up an object after being in front of purple_door_2. So even if the agent goes to purple_door_2, then to red_ball_1, picks it up, then drops it again to be in front of it, that's necessary.

But maybe the agent can pick up a different ball, like yellow_ball_1. Let's see:

After step6 (in room4):

7. gotodoor purple_door_2 room4 room2 (constraint3)

8. gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room4

9. pick yellow_ball_1 room4 (now holding something, satisfying constraint4)

10. gotoempty

11. drop yellow_ball_1 room4 (now in front of it)

12. gotoobject red_ball_1 room4 (now in front of red_ball_1)

This adds more steps. So the original plan with red_ball_1 is better.

So the original plan of 11 steps seems necessary. But wait, let's count again:

1. gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3

2. toggle red_door_1

3. gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1

4. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_4

5. toggle yellow_door_1

6. gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_1

7. gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_2

8. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_4

9. pick red_ball_1 room_4

10. gotoempty

11. drop red_ball_1 room_4

So that's 11 actions. But is there a way to reduce steps?

For example, after step7 (in front of purple_door_2), can the agent immediately go to an empty spot and drop something? But they haven't picked anything yet. So they need to pick up first.

Alternatively, after step7, gotoempty (step8), then gotoobject red_ball_1 (step9), pick (step10), then drop (step11). But this is still 11 steps.

Wait, maybe after step7 (in front of purple_door_2), the agent can go directly to an empty spot and then to the ball. But no, they need to be in front of the ball to pick it up.

Alternatively, after step7, the agent can gotoempty (step8), then pick up nothing (can't), so no. Must go to the ball.

Hmm. Maybe the plan is as short as possible. Let's check if all constraints are met:

- Constraint1: red_door_1 unlocked in step2. Yes.

- Constraint2: never in room2. All steps are in room1, 3, 4. Yes.

- Constraint3: in front of purple_door_2 in step7. Yes.

- Constraint4: after step7, agent picks up red_ball_1 in step9. So after being in front of purple_door_2, they hold an object. Yes.

- Constraint5: yellow_door_1 unlocked in step5. Yes.

- Constraint6: step9 (holding red_ball_1) and red_door_1 is unlocked. Yes.

So all constraints are satisfied. The plan is valid and meets all constraints. Now, is there a shorter plan?

Suppose the agent, after arriving in room4, instead of going to purple_door_2 first, goes directly to the red_ball_1. Then, after being in front of it, they have to go to purple_door_2, which requires more steps. So that's longer.

Alternatively, maybe the agent can toggle the doors in a different order. For example, unlock yellow_door_1 first, but they need to go through red_door_1 to get to room3. So the order is necessary.

I think the plan is optimal as is. So the final answer is the sequence of actions as outlined.
