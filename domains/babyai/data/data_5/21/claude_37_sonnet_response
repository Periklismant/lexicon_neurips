Let's break down the problem:

We have 4 rooms: room_1 (north-west), room_2 (south-west), room_3 (north-east), and room_4 (south-east).
We have 4 doors: purple_door_1 (connecting room_1 and room_2), red_door_1 (connecting room_1 and room_3), purple_door_2 (connecting room_2 and room_4), and yellow_door_1 (connecting room_3 and room_4).
Initially, all doors are locked.
We have several balls and a box distributed across the rooms.
We start in room_1 and need to have red_ball_1 in room_4 and be in front of it.

Additionally, there are several constraints that the plan must satisfy:

1. At some point, red_door_1 must be unlocked.
2. We are never allowed to be in room_2.
3. At some point, we must be in front of purple_door_2. When this happens, we must either be in room_3 or holding an object at that point or later.
4. At some point, yellow_door_1 must be unlocked.
5. At some point, we must be holding an object while red_door_1 is unlocked.

Let's think about a high-level plan:

The goal is to move red_ball_1 from room_4 to room_4 (it's already in room_4 in the initial state), be in room_4, and be in front of the ball. So we need to go to room_4 and then be in front of red_ball_1.

But there are constraints to consider. Let's ensure our plan satisfies all of them:

1. We need to go from room_1 to room_4. 
2. We cannot go through room_2 due to constraint 2.
3. So, we must go from room_1 to room_3, and then from room_3 to room_4.
4. To go from room_1 to room_3, we need to unlock red_door_1 (satisfying constraint 1).
5. To go from room_3 to room_4, we need to unlock yellow_door_1 (satisfying constraint 4).
6. At some point, we need to be in front of purple_door_2 (satisfying constraint 3).
7. After being in front of purple_door_2, we need to either be in room_3 or holding an object (to satisfy constraint 3).
8. At some point, we need to be holding an object while red_door_1 is unlocked (satisfying constraint 5).

The purple_door_2 constraint is tricky because we cannot go through room_2. But the constraint doesn't say we need to go through the door, just be in front of it. The problem is that purple_door_2 connects room_2 and room_4, which means we need to be in one of those rooms to be in front of the door. Since we cannot be in room_2, we must be in room_4.

But if we're approaching the door from room_4, and the constraint says after being in front of the door, we must either be in room_3 or holding an object, then we must be holding an object. Why? Because we'll remain in room_4, so we won't be in room_3.

Let's adjust our plan:

1. Pick up blue_ball_1 from room_1 (to satisfy constraints 5 and possibly 3).
2. Go in front of red_door_1 and unlock it (satisfying constraint 1).
3. Go to room_3.
4. Go in front of yellow_door_1 and unlock it (satisfying constraint 4).
5. Go to room_4.
6. Go in front of purple_door_2 while still holding blue_ball_1 (satisfying constraint 3).
7. Drop blue_ball_1.
8. Go in front of red_ball_1 (satisfying the goal).

Now, let's convert this high-level plan into a sequence of actions. I'll check that the plan makes sense considering the actions and preconditions given.

Alright, one problem with my plan is that it assumes we can approach purple_door_2 from room_4. However, the "gotodoor" action only allows us to approach a door if we're in a room that the door connects. Hence, I can't just be in room_4 and go in front of purple_door_2; I need to be in room_2, which is a problem because of the constraint that says we can't be in room_2.

Let's rethink a bit. If I can't go in front of purple_door_2 without being in room_2, and I can't be in room_2, this seems like a contradiction. Let me re-read the "gotodoor" action and ensure I understand it:

"'goto door': you may only go in front of a door d if (i) you are in a room which door d is connecting with another room, and (ii) there is no object blocking the position in front of d in the room you are currently in."

So, if I'm in room_4, and purple_door_2 connects room_4 and room_2, I can go in front of purple_door_2 from room_4. This is fine.

But let's be super careful here: The constraint says: "If expression 'you are in front of purple_door_2' holds in some state s, then expression 'At least one of the following conditions is true: "you are in room_3", "you are holding some object"' must hold at s or at some state after s."

Wait, this constraint is saying that after I'm in front of purple_door_2, I must either be in room_3 or holding some object. If I'm approaching the door from room_4, I won't be in room_3 immediately after unless I go there. So I either need to head to room_3 after being in front of the door or ensure I'm holding an object.

Let's adjust the plan:

1. Pick up blue_ball_1 from room_1 (to satisfy constraint 5).
2. Go in front of red_door_1 and unlock it (satisfying constraint 1).
3. Go to room_3.
4. Go in front of yellow_door_1 and unlock it (satisfying constraint 4).
5. Go to room_4.
6. Go in front of purple_door_2 while still holding blue_ball_1 (satisfying constraint 3, as I'll be holding an object).
7. Drop blue_ball_1.
8. Go in front of red_ball_1 (satisfying the goal).

Let's check if this works:

1. Can I pick up blue_ball_1 from room_1? Yes, I am in the same room, and I'm not holding any object.
2. Can I go in front of red_door_1? Yes, I'm in room_1, which red_door_1 connects with room_3.
3. Can I unlock (toggle) red_door_1? Yes, I'm in front of it.
4. Can I go to room_3? Yes, I'm in room_1, room_3 is adjacent to room_1, and red_door_1 (which connects them) is now unlocked.
5. Can I go in front of yellow_door_1? Yes, I'm in room_3, which yellow_door_1 connects with room_4.
6. Can I unlock (toggle) yellow_door_1? Yes, I'm in front of it.
7. Can I go to room_4? Yes, I'm in room_3, room_4 is adjacent to room_3, and yellow_door_1 (which connects them) is now unlocked.
8. Can I go in front of purple_door_2? Yes, I'm in room_4, which purple_door_2 connects with room_2, and there's no object blocking the door (AFAIK, we're not told any door is blocked). I'm also holding blue_ball_1, which will satisfy the constraint when I'm in front of the door.
9. Can I drop blue_ball_1? Yes, I'm holding it, and the position in front of me is empty (I just went in front of purple_door_2).
10. Can I go in front of red_ball_1? Yes, I'm in room_4 and red_ball_1 is in room_4.

Actually, there's an issue. After picking up blue_ball_1, I will not be in front of it anymore. So after picking it up and before going in front of red_door_1, I need to go to the door. Similarly, after dropping blue_ball_1, I need to explicitly move away from it before going in front of red_ball_1.

Let's refine the plan:

1. Go in front of blue_ball_1.
2. Pick up blue_ball_1.
3. Go in front of red_door_1.
4. Unlock (toggle) red_door_1.
5. Go to room_3.
6. Go in front of yellow_door_1.
7. Unlock (toggle) yellow_door_1.
8. Go to room_4.
9. Go in front of purple_door_2.
10. Go to empty.
11. Drop blue_ball_1.
12. Go in front of red_ball_1.

Let's see if there's any missing part or better alternatives:

Actually, we also need to satisfy constraint 5: "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'The following conditions are all true: "you are holding some object", "red_door_1 is not locked"'"

In our plan, we're holding blue_ball_1 and then unlocking red_door_1. At that point, we're satisfying the constraint.

Wait, I made a mistake. After I pick up blue_ball_1 and go in front of red_door_1, I unlock the door. At that point, I'm holding blue_ball_1 and red_door_1 is not locked, so constraint 5 is satisfied. There's no issue here.

Actually I need to check the effect of going in front of the door more carefully. After I pick up blue_ball_1, I am no longer in front of it. When I go in front of red_door_1, I am in front of red_door_1 and not in front of blue_ball_1.

Let me translate the plan into the exact steps provided in the problem:

1. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_1
2. pick blue_ball_1 room_1
3. gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3
4. toggle red_door_1
5. gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1
6. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_4
7. toggle yellow_door_1
8. gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_1
9. gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_2
10. gotoempty
11. drop blue_ball_1 room_4
12. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_4

Let's double-check our plan to ensure all constraints are satisfied:

1. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'red_door_1 is not locked'": Satisfied in step 4 when we toggle red_door_1.
2. "The following expression must hold in every state: 'you are not in room_2'": Satisfied as we never enter room_2.
3. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'you are in front of purple_door_2'": Satisfied in step 9 when we go in front of purple_door_2.
4. "If expression 'you are in front of purple_door_2' holds in some state s, then expression 'At least one of the following conditions is true: "you are in room_3", "you are holding some object"' must hold at s or at some state after s": Satisfied in step 9 as we're holding blue_ball_1.
5. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'yellow_door_1 is not locked'": Satisfied in step 7 when we toggle yellow_door_1.
6. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'The following conditions are all true: "you are holding some object", "red_door_1 is not locked"'": Satisfied in step 4 as we're holding blue_ball_1 and red_door_1 is not locked.

It seems like our plan satisfies all the constraints, so I'm confident in it.

Let's revisit an earlier question: do we need to deliberately move away from the door before dropping the ball? The action "gotoempty" does move us away from the door, and after performing it, we are in front of an empty position. The action "drop" requires the position in front of us to be empty, so the sequence should be fine. But to be sure, let's check the precise wording again.

The "gotoempty" effects state: "After performing this action, (i) if you were in front of some object or door x0, then you are no longer in front of x0 and (ii) you are in front of an empty position."

So after we perform "gotoempty", we are no longer in front of purple_door_2 and are in front of an empty position.

The "drop" preconditions state: "you may only drop an object x if (i) you are currently holding x, and (ii) the position in front of you is empty."

Since we're holding blue_ball_1 and the position in front of us is empty, we can drop blue_ball_1.

The effects of "drop" include: "(i) you are no longer carrying x, (ii) you are in front of x, (iii) your hands are empty, and (iv) object x is situated in the room you are currently in."

So after we drop blue_ball_1, we're in front of it.

Then, to go in front of red_ball_1, we'd use "gotoobject red_ball_1 room_4", which has the effect: "(i) if you were in front of some object or door x0, then you are no longer in front of x0 and (ii) you are in front of object x." So after this, we're no longer in front of blue_ball_1 and are in front of red_ball_1.

Wait, but this contradicts constraint 3! After we're in front of purple_door_2, we need to be in room_3 or hold an object later. But in step 10, we're no longer holding an object and not in room_3, which violates the constraint. So our current plan is invalid.

Here's a fix: we can maintain the constraint by carrying the ball throughout:

1. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_1
2. pick blue_ball_1 room_1
3. gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3
4. toggle red_door_1
5. gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1
6. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_4
7. toggle yellow_door_1
8. gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_1
9. gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_2
10. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_4
11. gotoempty
12. drop blue_ball_1 room_4
13. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_4

However, this seems a bit redundant. Let's revisit the constraint: "If expression 'you are in front of purple_door_2' holds in some state s, then expression 'At least one of the following conditions is true: "you are in room_3", "you are holding some object"' must hold at s or at some state after s"

After step 9, I'm in front of purple_door_2. At that state (s), I'm holding blue_ball_1, which satisfies the constraint. After that, I go to step 10 and am no longer in front of purple_door_2. The constraint only requires the condition to hold in state s (when I am in front of purple_door_2) or some state after s. Since it holds in state s, the constraint is satisfied, and I don't need to keep holding the ball after step 9. So our original plan should be fine as we were holding the ball while we were in front of the door.

Let me check the phrasing once more: "If expression 'you are in front of purple_door_2' holds in some state s, then expression 'At least one of the following conditions is true: "you are in room_3", "you are holding some object"' must hold at s or at some state after s."

Yes, as long as at state s (when I am in front of purple_door_2) or at any state after s, I am either in room_3 or holding an object, the constraint is satisfied. In our plan, at state s, I am holding an object (blue_ball_1), so the constraint is satisfied. After that, I drop blue_ball_1, but the constraint doesn't require me to keep holding it. So, our original plan is correct.

Actually in step 10 of my original plan, I wrote "gotoempty". But that's not the correct action. It's because we don't need an extra step to move to an empty position; we can simply drop the object we're holding. So the correct sequence would be:

1. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_1
2. pick blue_ball_1 room_1
3. gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3
4. toggle red_door_1
5. gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1
6. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_4
7. toggle yellow_door_1
8. gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_1
9. gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_2
10. drop blue_ball_1 room_4
11. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_4

Hmm, let's double-check the drop action. Specifically, the effects: "(i) you are no longer carrying x, (ii) you are in front of x, (iii) your hands are empty, and (iv) object x is situated in the room you are currently in."

That seems to work for step 10 as I am dropping blue_ball_1 and after that, I'll be in front of it. But I want to move to a different object, red_ball_1. The precondition for gotoobject is: "you may only go in front of an object x if you are in the same room as x."

This seems to be fine as both blue_ball_1 (which I dropped) and red_ball_1 are in room_4.

So, to summarize, the plan should be:

1. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_1
2. pick blue_ball_1 room_1
3. gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3
4. toggle red_door_1
5. gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1
6. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_4
7. toggle yellow_door_1
8. gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_1
9. gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_2
10. gotoempty
11. drop blue_ball_1 room_4
12. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_4

Wait, coming back to something I was discussing: after executing "drop blue_ball_1 room_4" I will already be in front of blue_ball_1, there's no need for additional gotoempty. If I'm already in front of blue_ball_1, then I just need to execute "gotoobject red_ball_1 room_4" to satisfy the goal.

So, the correct plan would be:

1. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_1
2. pick blue_ball_1 room_1
3. gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3
4. toggle red_door_1
5. gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1
6. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_4
7. toggle yellow_door_1
8. gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_1
9. gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_2
10. gotoempty
11. drop blue_ball_1 room_4
12. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_4

Actually, I need to look at the constraint about purple_door_2 again. The constraint says: "If expression 'you are in front of purple_door_2' holds in some state s, then expression 'At least one of the following conditions is true: "you are in room_3", "you are holding some object"' must hold at s or at some state after s."

If I go in front of purple_door_2 (step 9) while holding blue_ball_1, the constraint is satisfied at state s. After that, I can go to an empty position (step 10) and drop the blue_ball_1 (step 11). The constraint remains satisfied because it only needs to be true at s or some state after s, and it was true at s.

So, our plan from steps 1 to 12 seems correct.

But there's something that was bothering me, step 10. Let me re-read the "gotoempty" action again. The action allows you to go to an empty position in the room, where there's no object.

Now, the action "drop" has a precondition that says the position in front of you should be empty. After doing "gotodoor purple_door_2", I'm in front of the door. I don't think that's an "empty" position. So I need to go to an empty position before dropping the ball.

Actually I misunderstood. When I approach a door using "gotodoor", I am going to the position in front of the door. I find this a bit confusing, because a door is not an object. So let me double check by rereading the action:
"'goto door': you may only go in front of a door d if (i) you are in a room which door d is connecting with another room, and (ii) there is no object blocking the position in front of d in the room you are currently in."

Ah, I see. The position in front of the door can be blocked by an object. This means a door takes up a position in the room, and there's a position in front of the door where an agent can go. So, after executing "gotodoor purple_door_2", I'm in front of the door, not at the door or on the door. This position in front of the door is not "empty" since it's occupied by the door. So I do need to go to an empty position before dropping the ball, which justifies step 10.

Alright, I think I've thoroughly checked the plan, and it seems correct:

1. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_1
2. pick blue_ball_1 room_1
3. gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3
4. toggle red_door_1
5. gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1
6. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_4
7. toggle yellow_door_1
8. gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_1
9. gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_2
10. gotoempty
11. drop blue_ball_1 room_4
12. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_4

Wait, I seem to be missing something. Let's carefully reread the action "gotodoor" in the problem:

"gotodoor d r1 r2": Go in front of door d, connecting room r1 to room r2.

"'goto door': you may only go in front of a door d if (i) you are in a room which door d is connecting with another room, and (ii) there is no object blocking the position in front of d in the room you are currently in."

So, it seems for "gotodoor" I need to specify both rooms that the door connects. Let me correct my plan:

1. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_1
2. pick blue_ball_1 room_1
3. gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3
4. toggle red_door_1
5. gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1
6. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_4
7. toggle yellow_door_1
8. gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_1
9. gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_2
10. gotoempty
11. drop blue_ball_1 room_4
12. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_4

This is the correct plan, and it satisfies all the constraints.

Actually, I need to make sure I'm not confusing myself by swapping positions in the door. Let's check the setup once more:

We have 4 doors:
1. purple_door_1: connects room_1 and room_2
2. red_door_1: connects room_1 and room_3
3. purple_door_2: connects room_2 and room_4
4. yellow_door_1: connects room_3 and room_4

So, if I'm in room_4, I need to use "gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_2" and "gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_3", assuming the convention for "gotodoor" is "gotodoor door current_room connected_room".

Checking the room diagram again:
- room_1: north-west
- room_2: south-west
- room_3: north-east
- room_4: south-east

So, the correct action would be "gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_2" since purple_door_2 connects room_4 and room_2.

Yes, our plan is correct!

Actually, the problem states that "The format of each action in the plan should be: 'ActionName Argument1 ... ArgumentN', where each argument is an element of the domain." So I should format the actions as follows:

1. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_1
2. pick blue_ball_1 room_1
3. gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3
4. toggle red_door_1
5. gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1
6. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_4
7. toggle yellow_door_1
8. gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_1
9. gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_2
10. gotoempty
11. drop blue_ball_1 room_4
12. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_4

This looks correct to me.
