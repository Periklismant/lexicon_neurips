Okay, let's see. The goal is to get in front of a purple ball. The initial state has me in room_2. Let's check where the purple balls are. Purple_ball_1 is in room_1, and purple_ball_2 is in room_3. So I need to reach either of those.

First, I need to figure out how to get from room_2 to room_1 or room_3. The doors are all locked initially. The doors connecting room_2 to room_1 is purple_door_1, which is purple and locked. To unlock it, I need to toggle it. But to toggle a door, I have to be in front of it. So maybe I need to go to the door, unlock it, then go through.

But wait, room_2 is connected to room_1 via purple_door_1. So I can go to purple_door_1 from room_2. But wait, the preconditions for "gotodoor d r1 r2" require that I'm in a room connected by door d, and that there's no object blocking the position in front of the door. Are there any objects blocking doors in the initial state? The problem statement doesn't mention any objects blocking doors, except if they are being carried. Since all boxes and balls are in their rooms, maybe the doors aren't blocked. So I can go to purple_door_1 in room_2.

So steps could be: goto door purple_door_1 from room_2, then toggle it to unlock. Then go through the door to room_1. Once in room_1, go to purple_ball_1, and then I'm in front of it. But wait, the action to pick up isn't needed here; the goal is just to be in front of a purple ball. So maybe that's the plan.

But wait, the initial state says all doors are locked. So purple_door_1 is locked. To unlock it, I need to toggle it. But to toggle, I need to be in front of it. So first, gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1. Then toggle. Then gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1. Then gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_1. Then done.

But let me check the preconditions again. When I do gotodoor, I need to be in a room connected by the door. Since I'm in room_2, and purple_door_1 connects room_2 and room_1, that's okay. Then after toggling, the door becomes unlocked. Then I can use gotoroom to move to room_1. Once there, gotoobject purple_ball_1.

But wait, when I drop into room_1, I'm no longer in front of anything. So I need to go to the purple_ball_1. So that's the plan. Let me outline each step:

1. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1
2. toggle purple_door_1
3. gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1
4. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_1

This should work. Let me check each step's preconditions.

Step 1: "gotodoor d r1 r2" needs me to be in a room connected by d. Since I'm in room_2, and purple_door_1 connects room_2 and room_1, yes. Also, no object is blocking the door's front in room_2. Since initial state doesn't mention any objects blocking, this is okay.

Step 2: Toggle requires being in front of the door. After step 1, I'm in front of purple_door_1, so toggle is possible. It unlocks the door.

Step 3: gotoroom from room_2 to room_1 via purple_door_1. The door is now unlocked (since we toggled it), so the precondition is met. After this, I'm in room_1 and not in front of anything.

Step 4: gotoobject purple_ball_1 in room_1. Since I'm in room_1, and the ball is there, this is allowed. After this, I'm in front of the purple ball, meeting the goal.

Is there a shorter path? What about going to room_3? Let's see. To get to room_3 from room_2, the path would be through room_4? Because room_2 is connected to room_4 via grey_door_1. But grey_door_1 is locked. So to unlock it, I need to go to grey_door_1 in room_2, toggle it, then go to room_4. Then room_4 is connected to room_3 via purple_door_2, which is also locked. So that's two doors to unlock. That's longer. So the first path to room_1 is shorter.

Alternatively, room_1 is connected to room_3 via blue_door_1. But blue_door_1 is locked. If I were in room_1, could I go to room_3 via blue_door_1, but that door is locked. So if I have to go to room_3, that would require unlocking blue_door_1 as well. But since the purple_ball_1 is in room_1, it's easier to go there.

Therefore, the initial plan of four steps is the optimal one.
