Let me understand this planning problem:

1. We have a 2D gridworld with 4 rooms arranged in a square formation:
   - room_1 (north-west)
   - room_2 (south-west)
   - room_3 (north-east)
   - room_4 (south-east)

2. The rooms are connected by doors:
   - purple_door_1 connects room_1 and room_2
   - blue_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3
   - grey_door_1 connects room_2 and room_4
   - purple_door_2 connects room_3 and room_4

3. Initial state:
   - I am in room_2
   - green_box_1, red_box_1, and purple_ball_1 are in room_1
   - blue_ball_1 and blue_ball_2 are in room_2 (where I am)
   - purple_ball_2 and red_ball_1 are in room_3
   - red_box_2 is in room_4
   - All doors are locked
   - I'm not holding any object

4. Goal:
   - I need to be in front of a purple ball. There are two purple balls: purple_ball_1 in room_1 and purple_ball_2 in room_3.

5. Constraints:
   - purple_door_1 must remain locked throughout the plan
   - I must hold blue_ball_1 at some point
   - At some point, both grey_door_1 and blue_door_1 must be unlocked
   - I must be in front of purple_door_1 at some point
   - Before being in front of purple_door_1, either the door must be unlocked or I must be holding an object
   - I must be in room_1 at some point
   - Before entering room_1, I must be holding an object and blue_ball_1 must be in room_3

Let's think about a plan:

1. First, I need to move blue_ball_1 to room_3 before I can enter room_1 (constraint 7).
2. Since purple_door_1 must remain locked (constraint 1), I can't directly go from room_2 to room_1. I need to find an alternative path.
3. Since I need to unlock grey_door_1 and blue_door_1 at some point (constraint 3), I should plan to use these doors.
4. I need to hold blue_ball_1 at some point (constraint 2).
5. Before I can be in front of purple_door_1, I must either hold an object or the door must be unlocked. Since purple_door_1 must remain locked, I need to hold an object.

Let's try to formulate a plan:

1. Go to blue_ball_1 in room_2.
2. Pick up blue_ball_1.
3. Go to grey_door_1 (connecting room_2 and room_4).
4. Toggle grey_door_1 to unlock it.
5. Go to room_4 from room_2 using grey_door_1.
6. Go to purple_door_2 (connecting room_4 and room_3).
7. Toggle purple_door_2 to unlock it.
8. Go to room_3 from room_4 using purple_door_2.
9. Drop blue_ball_1 in room_3. (This satisfies the requirement that blue_ball_1 is in room_3 before I enter room_1.)
10. Go to blue_door_1 (connecting room_3 and room_1).
11. Toggle blue_door_1 to unlock it.
12. Go to purple_ball_2 in room_3 (which is a purple ball, satisfying the goal).
13. Pick up purple_ball_2.
14. Go to room_1 from room_3 using blue_door_1. (This satisfies the requirement that I must be in room_1 at some point.)
15. Go to purple_door_1 (connecting room_1 and room_2). (This satisfies the requirement that I must be in front of purple_door_1 at some point, and I'm holding an object as required.)
16. Go to purple_ball_1 in room_1.
17. Drop purple_ball_2 in room_1.
18. (I'm now in front of purple_ball_2 in room_1, satisfying the goal.)

But actually, this plan doesn't work correctly, because if I drop purple_ball_2, I'll be in front of it, not purple_ball_1. Let me reconsider.

Actually, the goal is that I'm in front of a purple ball, and there are two purple balls: purple_ball_1 in room_1 and purple_ball_2 in room_3. The simpler approach would be to go directly to purple_ball_2 in room_3, which avoids the need to enter room_1.

Let's revise the plan:

1. Go to blue_ball_1 in room_2.
2. Pick up blue_ball_1. (This satisfies constraint 2.)
3. Go to grey_door_1 (connecting room_2 and room_4).
4. Toggle grey_door_1 to unlock it.
5. Go to room_4 from room_2 using grey_door_1.
6. Go to purple_door_2 (connecting room_4 and room_3).
7. Toggle purple_door_2 to unlock it.
8. Go to room_3 from room_4 using purple_door_2.
9. Drop blue_ball_1 in room_3. (This satisfies the requirement that blue_ball_1 is in room_3 before I enter room_1.)
10. Go to blue_door_1 (connecting room_3 and room_1).
11. Toggle blue_door_1 to unlock it. (This, along with grey_door_1 being unlocked, satisfies constraint 3.)
12. Go to purple_ball_2 in room_3. (This satisfies the goal of being in front of a purple ball.)

But wait, this plan still doesn't satisfy all constraints. I need to be in front of purple_door_1 at some point (constraint 4) and also be in room_1 at some point (constraint 6). So I do need to enter room_1 eventually.

Let's revise the plan again:

1. Go to blue_ball_1 in room_2.
2. Pick up blue_ball_1. (This satisfies constraint 2.)
3. Go to grey_door_1 (connecting room_2 and room_4).
4. Toggle grey_door_1 to unlock it.
5. Go to room_4 from room_2 using grey_door_1.
6. Go to purple_door_2 (connecting room_4 and room_3).
7. Toggle purple_door_2 to unlock it.
8. Go to room_3 from room_4 using purple_door_2.
9. Drop blue_ball_1 in room_3. (This satisfies the requirement that blue_ball_1 is in room_3 before I enter room_1.)
10. Go to blue_door_1 (connecting room_3 and room_1).
11. Toggle blue_door_1 to unlock it. (This, along with grey_door_1 being unlocked, satisfies constraint 3.)
12. Go to room_1 from room_3 using blue_door_1. (This satisfies constraint 6.)
13. Go to purple_door_1 (connecting room_1 and room_2). (This satisfies constraint 4, and I satisfy the prerequisite in constraint 5 because blue_ball_1 is in room_3.)
14. Go to purple_ball_1 in room_1. (This satisfies the goal of being in front of a purple ball.)

But wait, there's still an issue. Constraint 5 says that if I'm in front of purple_door_1, there must be an earlier state where either purple_door_1 is unlocked or I'm holding an object. In my current plan, I'm not holding any object when I'm in front of purple_door_1, and purple_door_1 is locked (as required by constraint 1).

Let me revise again:

1. Go to blue_ball_1 in room_2.
2. Pick up blue_ball_1. (This satisfies constraint 2.)
3. Go to purple_door_1 (connecting room_2 and room_1). (This satisfies constraint 4, and I satisfy the prerequisite in constraint 5 because I'm holding blue_ball_1.)
4. Go to grey_door_1 (connecting room_2 and room_4).
5. Toggle grey_door_1 to unlock it.
6. Go to room_4 from room_2 using grey_door_1.
7. Go to purple_door_2 (connecting room_4 and room_3).
8. Toggle purple_door_2 to unlock it.
9. Go to room_3 from room_4 using purple_door_2.
10. Drop blue_ball_1 in room_3. (This satisfies the requirement that blue_ball_1 is in room_3 before I enter room_1.)
11. Go to blue_door_1 (connecting room_3 and room_1).
12. Toggle blue_door_1 to unlock it. (This, along with grey_door_1 being unlocked, satisfies constraint 3.)
13. Go to purple_ball_2 in room_3. (This satisfies the goal of being in front of a purple ball.)

But this still doesn't satisfy constraint 6, which says I must be in room_1 at some point. Let's revise again:

1. Go to blue_ball_1 in room_2.
2. Pick up blue_ball_1. (This satisfies constraint 2.)
3. Go to purple_door_1 (connecting room_2 and room_1). (This satisfies constraint 4, and I satisfy the prerequisite in constraint 5 because I'm holding blue_ball_1.)
4. Go to grey_door_1 (connecting room_2 and room_4).
5. Toggle grey_door_1 to unlock it.
6. Go to room_4 from room_2 using grey_door_1.
7. Go to purple_door_2 (connecting room_4 and room_3).
8. Toggle purple_door_2 to unlock it.
9. Go to room_3 from room_4 using purple_door_2.
10. Drop blue_ball_1 in room_3. (This satisfies the requirement that blue_ball_1 is in room_3 before I enter room_1.)
11. Go to blue_door_1 (connecting room_3 and room_1).
12. Toggle blue_door_1 to unlock it. (This, along with grey_door_1 being unlocked, satisfies constraint 3.)
13. Go to room_1 from room_3 using blue_door_1. (This satisfies constraint 6.)
14. Go to purple_ball_1 in room_1. (This satisfies the goal of being in front of a purple ball.)

This plan seems to satisfy all constraints and the goal. Let's double-check:

1. purple_door_1 remains locked throughout (constraint 1): ✓
2. I hold blue_ball_1 at some point (constraint 2): ✓
3. Both grey_door_1 and blue_door_1 are unlocked at some point (constraint 3): ✓
4. I am in front of purple_door_1 at some point (constraint 4): ✓
5. Before being in front of purple_door_1, I am holding blue_ball_1 (satisfying constraint 5): ✓
6. I am in room_1 at some point (constraint 6): ✓
7. Before entering room_1, I am holding an object (blue_ball_1) and blue_ball_1 is in room_3 (satisfying constraint 7): Wait, this doesn't make sense. I can't be holding blue_ball_1 and have it in room_3 at the same time.

Let me reread constraint 7: "If expression 'you are in room_1' holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: 'The following conditions are all true: "you are holding some object", "blue_ball_1 is in room_3"'"

This means that before I enter room_1, there must be a state where I'm holding some object (not necessarily blue_ball_1) and blue_ball_1 is in room_3. So I need to modify my plan:

1. Go to blue_ball_1 in room_2.
2. Pick up blue_ball_1. (This satisfies constraint 2.)
3. Go to purple_door_1 (connecting room_2 and room_1). (This satisfies constraint 4, and I satisfy the prerequisite in constraint 5 because I'm holding blue_ball_1.)
4. Go to grey_door_1 (connecting room_2 and room_4).
5. Toggle grey_door_1 to unlock it.
6. Go to room_4 from room_2 using grey_door_1.
7. Go to purple_door_2 (connecting room_4 and room_3).
8. Toggle purple_door_2 to unlock it.
9. Go to room_3 from room_4 using purple_door_2.
10. Drop blue_ball_1 in room_3. (Now blue_ball_1 is in room_3.)
11. Go to purple_ball_2 in room_3.
12. Pick up purple_ball_2. (Now I'm holding an object and blue_ball_1 is in room_3, satisfying the prerequisite for constraint 7.)
13. Go to blue_door_1 (connecting room_3 and room_1).
14. Toggle blue_door_1 to unlock it. (This, along with grey_door_1 being unlocked, satisfies constraint 3.)
15. Go to room_1 from room_3 using blue_door_1. (This satisfies constraint 6.)
16. Go to purple_ball_1 in room_1.
17. Drop purple_ball_2 in room_1.
18. Go to purple_ball_1 in room_1. (This satisfies the goal of being in front of a purple ball.)

Actually, there's still an issue. Step 18 assumes I can go to purple_ball_1 after dropping purple_ball_2, but that doesn't make sense because I'd already be in front of purple_ball_2 after dropping it. Let me revise:

1. Go to blue_ball_1 in room_2.
2. Pick up blue_ball_1. (This satisfies constraint 2.)
3. Go to purple_door_1 (connecting room_2 and room_1). (This satisfies constraint 4, and I satisfy the prerequisite in constraint 5 because I'm holding blue_ball_1.)
4. Go to grey_door_1 (connecting room_2 and room_4).
5. Toggle grey_door_1 to unlock it.
6. Go to room_4 from room_2 using grey_door_1.
7. Go to purple_door_2 (connecting room_4 and room_3).
8. Toggle purple_door_2 to unlock it.
9. Go to room_3 from room_4 using purple_door_2.
10. Drop blue_ball_1 in room_3. (Now blue_ball_1 is in room_3.)
11. Go to purple_ball_2 in room_3.
12. Pick up purple_ball_2. (Now I'm holding an object and blue_ball_1 is in room_3, satisfying the prerequisite for constraint 7.)
13. Go to blue_door_1 (connecting room_3 and room_1).
14. Toggle blue_door_1 to unlock it. (This, along with grey_door_1 being unlocked, satisfies constraint 3.)
15. Go to room_1 from room_3 using blue_door_1. (This satisfies constraint 6.)
16. Go to purple_ball_1 in room_1.
17. Gotoempty. (So I'm no longer in front of purple_ball_1.)
18. Drop purple_ball_2 in room_1.
19. Go to purple_ball_1 in room_1. (This satisfies the goal of being in front of a purple ball.)

Let's convert this to the exact action format:

1. "gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_2"
2. "pick blue_ball_1 room_2"
3. "gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1"
4. "gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_4"
5. "toggle grey_door_1"
6. "gotoroom room_2 room_4 grey_door_1"
7. "gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_3"
8. "toggle purple_door_2"
9. "gotoroom room_4 room_3 purple_door_2"
10. "gotoempty"
11. "drop blue_ball_1 room_3"
12. "gotoobject purple_ball_2 room_3"
13. "pick purple_ball_2 room_3"
14. "gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_1"
15. "toggle blue_door_1"
16. "gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_1"
17. "gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_1"
18. "gotoempty"
19. "drop purple_ball_2 room_1"
20. "gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_1"

Hold on, I notice a problem in step 11. I need to be in front of an empty position to drop an object. Let me fix that:

1. "gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_2"
2. "pick blue_ball_1 room_2"
3. "gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1"
4. "gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_4"
5. "toggle grey_door_1"
6. "gotoroom room_2 room_4 grey_door_1"
7. "gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_3"
8. "toggle purple_door_2"
9. "gotoroom room_4 room_3 purple_door_2"
10. "gotoempty"
11. "drop blue_ball_1 room_3"
12. "gotoobject purple_ball_2 room_3"
13. "pick purple_ball_2 room_3"
14. "gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_1"
15. "toggle blue_door_1"
16. "gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_1"
17. "gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_1"
18. "gotoempty"
19. "drop purple_ball_2 room_1"
20. "gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_1"

Actually, this plan should work. Steps 10-11 are correct: after going to room_3, I use "gotoempty" to go in front of an empty position, and then I can drop blue_ball_1.

One more double-check on all constraints:

1. purple_door_1 remains locked throughout (constraint 1): ✓
2. I hold blue_ball_1 at some point (constraint 2): ✓ (Steps 2-10)
3. Both grey_door_1 and blue_door_1 are unlocked at some point (constraint 3): ✓ (Steps 5 and 15)
4. I am in front of purple_door_1 at some point (constraint 4): ✓ (Step 3)
5. Before being in front of purple_door_1, I am holding blue_ball_1 (satisfying constraint 5): ✓ (Step 2 before Step 3)
6. I am in room_1 at some point (constraint 6): ✓ (Steps 16-20)
7. Before entering room_1, there's a state where I'm holding some object (purple_ball_2) and blue_ball_1 is in room_3 (satisfying constraint 7): ✓ (Steps 11-15)
8. Goal: I am in front of a purple ball: ✓ (Step 20)

This plan satisfies all constraints and the goal. One final check: is this the optimal (shortest) plan? Let me review the plan to see if any steps can be eliminated:

1. "gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_2" - Necessary to get blue_ball_1.
2. "pick blue_ball_1 room_2" - Necessary to satisfy constraint 2.
3. "gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1" - Necessary to satisfy constraint 4.
4. "gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_4" - Necessary to unlock grey_door_1.
5. "toggle grey_door_1" - Necessary to satisfy constraint 3.
6. "gotoroom room_2 room_4 grey_door_1" - Necessary to reach room_3.
7. "gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_3" - Necessary to reach room_3.
8. "toggle purple_door_2" - Necessary to unlock purple_door_2.
9. "gotoroom room_4 room_3 purple_door_2" - Necessary to reach room_3.
10. "gotoempty" - Necessary to drop blue_ball_1.
11. "drop blue_ball_1 room_3" - Necessary to have blue_ball_1 in room_3.
12. "gotoobject purple_ball_2 room_3" - Necessary to get purple_ball_2.
13. "pick purple_ball_2 room_3" - Necessary to hold an object while blue_ball_1 is in room_3.
14. "gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_1" - Necessary to unlock blue_door_1.
15. "toggle blue_door_1" - Necessary to satisfy constraint 3.
16. "gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_1" - Necessary to satisfy constraint 6.
17. "gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_1" - We don't actually need this step. We can go directly to an empty position and drop purple_ball_2, and then go to purple_ball_1.
18. "gotoempty" - Necessary to drop purple_ball_2.
19. "drop purple_ball_2 room_1" - Necessary to free our hands.
20. "gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_1" - Necessary to satisfy the goal.

Let me revise to eliminate step 17:

1. "gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_2"
2. "pick blue_ball_1 room_2"
3. "gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1"
4. "gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_4"
5. "toggle grey_door_1"
6. "gotoroom room_2 room_4 grey_door_1"
7. "gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_3"
8. "toggle purple_door_2"
9. "gotoroom room_4 room_3 purple_door_2"
10. "gotoempty"
11. "drop blue_ball_1 room_3"
12. "gotoobject purple_ball_2 room_3"
13. "pick purple_ball_2 room_3"
14. "gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_1"
15. "toggle blue_door_1"
16. "gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_1"
17. "gotoempty"
18. "drop purple_ball_2 room_1"
19. "gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_1"

Wait, I think dropping purple_ball_2 is unnecessary. The goal is to be in front of a purple ball, and I could simply go to purple_ball_1 in room_1 right after entering room_1. Let me revise:

1. "gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_2"
2. "pick blue_ball_1 room_2"
3. "gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1"
4. "gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_4"
5. "toggle grey_door_1"
6. "gotoroom room_2 room_4 grey_door_1"
7. "gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_3"
8. "toggle purple_door_2"
9. "gotoroom room_4 room_3 purple_door_2"
10. "gotoempty"
11. "drop blue_ball_1 room_3"
12. "gotoobject purple_ball_2 room_3"
13. "pick purple_ball_2 room_3"
14. "gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_1"
15. "toggle blue_door_1"
16. "gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_1"
17. "gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_1"

No, wait, I see another issue. If I enter room_1 while holding purple_ball_2, and purple_ball_1 is also in room_1, then the goal might be satisfied immediately, since purple_ball_2 is a purple ball. Let me make sure this is correct:

The goal is:
"There is a ball v such that "The following conditions are all true: "v is purple", "you are in front of v"""

So the goal is to be in front of any purple ball. This means that after I enter room_1, I should go directly to purple_ball_1.

Let's stick with the previous plan:

1. "gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_2"
2. "pick blue_ball_1 room_2"
3. "gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1"
4. "gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_4"
5. "toggle grey_door_1"
6. "gotoroom room_2 room_4 grey_door_1"
7. "gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_3"
8. "toggle purple_door_2"
9. "gotoroom room_4 room_3 purple_door_2"
10. "gotoempty"
11. "drop blue_ball_1 room_3"
12. "gotoobject purple_ball_2 room_3"
13. "pick purple_ball_2 room_3"
14. "gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_1"
15. "toggle blue_door_1"
16. "gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_1"
17. "gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_1"

This plan seems optimal and satisfies all constraints and the goal.

Actually, I just realized that the most direct way to satisfy the goal would be to go to purple_ball_2 in room_3. Let me try to adapt the plan:

1. "gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_2"
2. "pick blue_ball_1 room_2"
3. "gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1"
4. "gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_4"
5. "toggle grey_door_1"
6. "gotoroom room_2 room_4 grey_door_1"
7. "gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_3"
8. "toggle purple_door_2"
9. "gotoroom room_4 room_3 purple_door_2"
10. "gotoempty"
11. "drop blue_ball_1 room_3"
12. "gotoobject purple_ball_2 room_3"

But this doesn't satisfy all constraints. In particular, I need to be in room_1 at some point (constraint 6) and in front of purple_door_1 at some point (constraint 4).

Let me go back to the previous plan:

1. "gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_2"
2. "pick blue_ball_1 room_2"
3. "gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1"
4. "gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_4"
5. "toggle grey_door_1"
6. "gotoroom room_2 room_4 grey_door_1"
7. "gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_3"
8. "toggle purple_door_2"
9. "gotoroom room_4 room_3 purple_door_2"
10. "gotoempty"
11. "drop blue_ball_1 room_3"
12. "gotoobject purple_ball_2 room_3"
13. "pick purple_ball_2 room_3"
14. "gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_1"
15. "toggle blue_door_1"
16. "gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_1"
17. "gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_1"

This plan satisfies all constraints and the goal, and I believe it is optimal.

Final answer:
```
