Okay, let's tackle this planning problem step by step. First, I need to understand the initial state, the goal, and the constraints. 

The initial state is that the agent is in room_2. The goal is to have a purple ball that the agent is in front of. The constraints are a bit complex, so I need to make sure each one is satisfied.

Let's list out the constraints:

1. Purple_door_1 must always be locked. So any action that might unlock it is prohibited. Since the initial state has it locked, we must not toggle it at any point.

2. At some point, the agent must hold blue_ball_1.

3. At some point, both grey_door_1 and blue_door_1 must be unlocked.

4. The agent must be in front of purple_door_1 at some state.

5. If the agent is in front of purple_door_1, there must be a prior state where either purple_door_1 is unlocked (which it's not, since it's always locked) or the agent is holding something. Since purple_door_1 is always locked, the agent must have been holding an object before being in front of it.

6. The agent must be in room_1 at some point.

7. If the agent is in room_1, there must be a prior state where they were holding an object and blue_ball_1 was in room_3.

Hmm. Let's think about the goal first: getting in front of a purple ball. The purple balls are purple_ball_1 in room_1 and purple_ball_2 in room_3. So the agent needs to be in front of one of these.

But to reach room_1 from room_2, the door is purple_door_1, which is locked and must remain locked. Wait, but how do we get into room_1 then? Because purple_door_1 is locked and we can't unlock it because the constraint says it must always be locked. So maybe the agent is stuck in room_2 unless there's another way. Wait, the doors connecting rooms are:

- room_1 and room_2 via purple_door_1 (locked, can't toggle)
- room_1 and room_3 via blue_door_1 (locked initially, but maybe we can unlock it)
- room_2 and room_4 via grey_door_1 (locked initially)
- room_3 and room_4 via purple_door_2 (locked)

So starting in room_2, the agent can go to room_4 via grey_door_1 if they can unlock it. Then from room_4, maybe go to room_3 via purple_door_2? But that's also locked. Alternatively, maybe unlock blue_door_1 to get from room_1 to room_3, but getting to room_1 is impossible because purple_door_1 is locked and can't be opened. Wait, this seems conflicting. Unless there's a way to get to room_1 through another path.

Wait, the rooms are arranged as:

room_1 (NW) connected to room_2 (SW) via purple_door_1, and room_1 connected to room_3 (NE) via blue_door_1. Room_2 connected to room_4 (SE) via grey_door_1, and room_3 connected to room_4 via purple_door_2. So the layout is a square with room_1 top left, room_2 bottom left, room_3 top right, room_4 bottom right. So from room_2, the agent can go to room_4 via grey_door_1 (if unlocked) or to room_1 via purple_door_1 (which is locked and can't be toggled).

But the agent starts in room_2. To get to room_1, they need to go through purple_door_1, which is locked. But since purple_door_1 must remain locked (constraint 1), they can't go that way. So maybe they can't reach room_1? But constraint 6 requires the agent to be in room_1 at some point. Wait, that's a problem. How can the agent get to room_1 if the only door is locked and can't be toggled?

Wait, unless there's another path. Let's see. From room_2, they can go to room_4 via grey_door_1. If they can unlock grey_door_1, then they can go to room_4. From room_4, they can go to room_3 via purple_door_2 (if unlocked), then from room_3 to room_1 via blue_door_1 (if unlocked). So that's a possible path. But first, they need to unlock grey_door_1 and blue_door_1.

But the initial state has all doors locked. So the agent needs to unlock them. But the toggle action requires being in front of the door. To get in front of a door, you need to be in a room connected by that door, and no object is blocking the position in front of the door.

Looking at the initial objects in each room:

room_1 has green_box_1, red_box_1, purple_ball_1.

room_2 has blue_ball_1, blue_ball_2.

room_3 has purple_ball_2, red_ball_1.

room_4 has red_box_2.

So in room_2, the doors are purple_door_1 (connecting to room_1) and grey_door_1 (connecting to room_4). To go to grey_door_1, the agent needs to check if there's an object blocking it. The objects in room_2 are blue_ball_1 and blue_ball_2. If their positions are not blocking the door, then the agent can goto the door. Assuming the doors are in certain positions, but the problem doesn't specify where the objects are placed relative to the doors. The problem states that "goto door" is possible if there's no object blocking the position in front of the door. So unless an object is in front of the door in the current room, the agent can go there.

Assuming that in room_2, the grey_door_1 is not blocked by any objects (since the balls are in room_2 but maybe not in front of the door), the agent can go to grey_door_1. But first, the agent needs to unlock it. To toggle a door, you need to be in front of it. So the steps would be:

1. Goto grey_door_1 from room_2. But since it's locked, can't go through yet. Wait, no, "goto door" just requires being in the room connected by the door and no blocking object. So the agent can "gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_4" while in room_2. Then toggle it to unlock. Then go to room_4. Then in room_4, go to purple_door_2 (connecting to room_3), unlock it, go to room_3. Then in room_3, go to blue_door_1 (connecting to room_1), unlock it, go to room_1. But wait, the blue_door_1 is between room_1 and room_3. So from room_3, the agent can unlock blue_door_1 (if not blocked), then go to room_1.

But let's see. Let's outline possible steps.

Initial state: agent in room_2, all doors locked.

Constraints:

- Must be in room_1 at some point. But to get there, need to go through blue_door_1 from room_3 to room_1, which requires unlocking blue_door_1.

So the plan would involve:

1. Unlock grey_door_1 in room_2.

2. Go to room_4 via grey_door_1.

3. Unlock purple_door_2 in room_4.

4. Go to room_3 via purple_door_2.

5. Unlock blue_door_1 in room_3.

6. Go to room_1 via blue_door_1.

But in step 5, unlocking blue_door_1 would require being in front of it in room_3. Then toggle it. Then go to room_1.

Once in room_1, the agent can pick up the purple_ball_1, but the goal is to be in front of a purple ball. Alternatively, maybe they can just go to the purple_ball_1 in room_1.

But the goal is to have a purple ball in front of the agent. So once in room_1, the agent can "gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_1" and that's the goal. But wait, the problem says "there is a ball v such that v is purple and you are in front of v". So the agent needs to be in front of a purple ball in the final state. So the final action should be "gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_1", but the agent must be in room_1 for that. But how to get there.

But to get to room_1, the agent must go through blue_door_1 from room_3. So the path is room_2 → room_4 → room_3 → room_1.

But let's outline the steps with actions.

Starting in room_2.

First, need to unlock grey_door_1. So:

1. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_4 (precondition: in room_2, door connects room_2 and room_4, no object blocking). Assuming possible.

2. toggle grey_door_1 (now it's unlocked). This satisfies the constraint that at some point grey_door_1 and blue_door_1 are unlocked (but blue_door_1 is still locked here; need to unlock that later).

3. gotoroom room_2 room_4 grey_door_1. Now in room_4.

4. In room_4, need to unlock purple_door_2 to get to room_3.

   - gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_3.

   - toggle purple_door_2 (now unlocked).

5. gotoroom room_4 room_3 purple_door_2. Now in room_3.

6. In room_3, unlock blue_door_1:

   - gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_1.

   - toggle blue_door_1 (unlocks it).

7. Now, go to room_1 via blue_door_1:

   - gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_1.

Now in room_1. This satisfies the constraint of being in room_1 at some point. But according to constraint 7, if the agent is in room_1, there must have been a prior state where they were holding an object and blue_ball_1 was in room_3. Wait, blue_ball_1 is initially in room_2. So this is a problem. Because blue_ball_1 starts in room_2. So how can it be in room_3 in a prior state?

This seems impossible unless the agent moves blue_ball_1 to room_3. But moving it requires picking it up in room_2, then carrying it through doors. Let's see.

So the agent must have, before entering room_1, held some object and blue_ball_1 must be in room_3. But blue_ball_1 starts in room_2, so to get it to room_3, the agent must pick it up in room_2, carry it through room_2 → room_4 → room_3, then drop it in room_3. Then, after that, go to room_1. But that requires a lot of steps.

But also, the agent must hold blue_ball_1 at some point (constraint 2). So combining these steps.

So let's adjust the plan:

First, in room_2:

1. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_2.

2. pick blue_ball_1 room_2. Now holding it. This satisfies constraint 2.

Then, proceed to unlock doors and move to room_3, drop blue_ball_1 there, then go to room_1.

So revised steps:

1. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_2.

2. pick blue_ball_1 room_2. (Now holding it)

3. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_4.

4. toggle grey_door_1. (Unlock it)

5. gotoroom room_2 room_4 grey_door_1. (Now in room_4)

6. gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_3.

7. toggle purple_door_2. (Unlock)

8. gotoroom room_4 room_3 purple_door_2. (Now in room_3)

9. drop blue_ball_1 room_3. (Now blue_ball_1 is in room_3)

10. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_1.

11. toggle blue_door_1. (Unlock)

12. gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_1. (Now in room_1. Now, prior to this step, in step 9, the agent was holding blue_ball_1, and in step 9, blue_ball_1 is dropped in room_3. So when entering room_1 (step 12), the prior state (step 9) has the agent holding blue_ball_1 (before dropping) and after step 9, blue_ball_1 is in room_3. So the condition for constraint 7 is met: before entering room_1 (step 12), there was a state (step 2-9) where the agent was holding an object (blue_ball_1) and blue_ball_1 is in room_3 (after step 9).

But constraint 7 requires that if the agent is in room_1, then in a prior state, the agent was holding some object AND blue_ball_1 was in room_3. So after step 9, blue_ball_1 is in room_3, and the agent was holding it in step 2-9 (until step 9 where it's dropped). So when the agent enters room_1 (step 12), the prior state (step 9) satisfies that.

Now, once in room_1, the agent can "gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_1" to be in front of it. That would achieve the goal.

But we also need to satisfy other constraints:

- Constraint 3: at some point, both grey_door_1 and blue_door_1 are unlocked. In step 4, grey_door_1 is unlocked. In step 11, blue_door_1 is unlocked. So after step 11, both are unlocked. So the state after step 11 has both doors unlocked. That's one state where both are not locked. So constraint 3 is satisfied here.

- Constraint 4: must be in front of purple_door_1 at some point. Purple_door_1 is in room_1 and room_2. The agent is in room_1 now. To get in front of purple_door_1, they need to go to it in room_1. So after step 12 (in room_1):

13. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2. Now in front of purple_door_1. This satisfies constraint 4.

But constraint 5 says that if you are in front of purple_door_1, there must be a prior state where you were holding something or the door was unlocked. The door is always locked, so the prior state must have you holding something. When did the agent hold something? Steps 2-9 (holding blue_ball_1). So after step 13 (being in front of purple_door_1), the prior state (steps 2-9) have the agent holding something. So constraint 5 is satisfied.

Now, after step 13, the agent is in front of purple_door_1. Then they need to go to the purple_ball_1 in room_1.

14. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_1.

Now, the goal is achieved: in front of a purple ball (purple_ball_1).

But let's check all constraints:

1. Purple_door_1 remains locked. It was initially locked, and we never toggled it. So that's good.

2. Held blue_ball_1 at step 2.

3. After step 11, both grey_door_1 (unlocked in step 4) and blue_door_1 (unlocked in step 11) are unlocked. So at step 11's state, both are unlocked? Wait, step 4 unlocks grey_door_1, step 11 unlocks blue_door_1. So after step 11, both are unlocked. So the state after step 11 meets this.

4. Step 13: in front of purple_door_1.

5. Step 13's condition: prior holding (steps 2-9).

6. Step 12: in room_1.

7. When entering room_1 (step 12), prior state (step 9) has agent holding blue_ball_1 (before step 9) and blue_ball_1 is in room_3 (after step 9).

So all constraints are satisfied.

Now, the plan steps:

1. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_2

2. pick blue_ball_1 room_2

3. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_4

4. toggle grey_door_1

5. gotoroom room_2 room_4 grey_door_1

6. gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_3

7. toggle purple_door_2

8. gotoroom room_4 room_3 purple_door_2

9. drop blue_ball_1 room_3

10. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_1

11. toggle blue_door_1

12. gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_1

13. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2

14. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_1

Wait, but step 13 is in room_1. After step 12, the agent is in room_1. Then step 13 is gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2. That's allowed. Then step 14 is going to the purple_ball_1 in room_1.

But after dropping blue_ball_1 in room_3, the agent is not holding anything. So steps 9 to 14, the agent is not holding anything except when necessary.

This seems to work. Now, checking for optimality. Is there a shorter plan? Let's see. For example, can we combine some steps? Let's see.

Alternative approach: after step 9 (drop blue_ball_1 in room_3), the agent can go directly to blue_door_1, unlock it, go to room_1, then goto purple_ball_1. The steps are as above.

But perhaps there's a way to avoid some steps. For example, after unlocking grey_door_1, going to room_4, unlock purple_door_2, go to room_3, unlock blue_door_1, go to room_1. Then goto purple_ball_1. But without moving blue_ball_1, then constraint 7 would fail because to be in room_1, the agent must have held an object and blue_ball_1 must be in room_3. Since blue_ball_1 was originally in room_2, unless moved, it can't be in room_3. So moving it is necessary.

Hence, the steps are necessary. So the plan length is 14 actions. Is that the minimal? Let's see.

Alternative: maybe after picking blue_ball_1, the agent can take it to room_3 via room_4, drop it there, then proceed. Which is what we did.

Another possible optimization: when in room_3 after dropping blue_ball_1, unlock blue_door_1, then go to room_1. Then goto purple_door_1. Then goto purple_ball_1.

Yes, that's what we have.

So the plan seems optimal. Let's check if each action's preconditions are met.

Step 1: gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_2. Agent is in room_2, so allowed.

Step 2: pick blue_ball_1 room_2. Agent is in front of it (after step 1), and not holding anything. So allowed.

Step 3: gotodoor grey_door_1 room_2 room_4. Agent is in room_2, door connects to room_4. Assuming no object blocking. Since initial room_2 has blue_ball_1 and blue_ball_2, but after picking blue_ball_1, it's no longer in room_2. So blue_ball_2 remains. But unless it's blocking the door, it's allowed. The problem states that the "goto door" action is allowed if there's no object blocking the position in front of the door. Assuming that blue_ball_2 is not blocking grey_door_1, so allowed.

Step 4: toggle grey_door_1. Agent is in front of it (from step 3).

Step 5: gotoroom room_2 room_4 grey_door_1. Door is unlocked now.

Step 6: gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_3. Agent is in room_4, door connects to room_3. Assuming no object blocking. The only object in room_4 is red_box_2. If it's not blocking the door, allowed.

Step 7: toggle purple_door_2. Now unlocked.

Step 8: gotoroom room_4 room_3 purple_door_2. Door is unlocked.

Step 9: drop blue_ball_1 room_3. Agent is holding it (from step 2), and in room_3. After dropping, blue_ball_1 is in room_3.

Step 10: gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_1. Agent is in room_3, door connects to room_1. No object blocking (assuming purple_ball_2 and red_ball_1 aren't blocking).

Step 11: toggle blue_door_1. Now unlocked.

Step 12: gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_1. Door is unlocked.

Step 13: gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2. Agent is in room_1, door connects to room_2. No object blocking (assuming green_box_1, red_box_1, purple_ball_1 aren't blocking).

Step 14: gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_1. Agent is in room_1.

All preconditions seem met.

So the final plan should be the 14 steps outlined.
