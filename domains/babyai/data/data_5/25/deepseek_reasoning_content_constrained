Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. Hmm, the goal is to have a grey door that's unlocked, and I need to be in front of it. The doors are yellow_door_1, purple_door_1, red_door_1, and grey_door_1. The grey door is grey_door_1, which connects room_3 and room_4. But wait, the constraints say I can never be in room_4. So I can't go to room_4. That means I have to interact with grey_door_1 from room_3. But how?

First, the initial state: I'm in room_2. All doors are locked. The grey_door_1 connects room_3 and room_4, so to get to room_3, maybe I can go through room_1 via purple_door_1. But purple_door_1 is locked. To unlock it, I need to toggle it. But to toggle a door, I need to be in front of it. So to get to purple_door_1 from room_1, but I'm in room_2. The doors from room_2 are yellow_door_1 to room_1 and red_door_1 to room_4. But red_door_1 is locked, and I can't go to room_4 anyway. So the only way out of room_2 is through yellow_door_1 to room_1. But yellow_door_1 is locked. To unlock it, I need to toggle it. But to toggle, I need to be in front of it. So first, I need to go to yellow_door_1 in room_2.

Wait, the doors are two-way. So in room_2, the doors connected are yellow_door_1 (to room_1) and red_door_1 (to room_4). So I can go in front of yellow_door_1 in room_2. Then toggle it to unlock. Then go to room_1. Once in room_1, the doors are yellow_door_1 (back to room_2) and purple_door_1 (to room_3). But purple_door_1 is locked. So I need to go to purple_door_1 in room_1, toggle it to unlock, then go to room_3. Once in room_3, the doors are purple_door_1 (to room_1) and grey_door_1 (to room_4). Since room_4 is off-limits, I need to handle grey_door_1 from room_3. So I can go in front of grey_door_1 in room_3, toggle it to unlock. Then that would satisfy the goal: being in front of a grey door (grey_door_1) that's unlocked.

But wait, the goal is "There is a door d such that d is grey, you are in front of d, and d is not locked." So once I unlock grey_door_1 and are in front of it, that's the goal. But let's check the constraints.

Constraints:

1. At least one state where red_door_1 is locked. Well, initially it's locked. So that's covered as long as we don't unlock it. Since we can't go to room_4, maybe we don't need to touch red_door_1. So that's okay.

2. If red_door_1 is locked in some state s, then in s or after, either hold red_ball_2 or be in room_1. Since red_door_1 is initially locked, and we need this condition. So in the initial state (room_2), red_door_1 is locked. So in the initial state, the agent is in room_2, so the condition "you are in room_1" isn't true. So we need to either pick up red_ball_2 at some point after. But the constraint is that if red_door_1 is locked in state s, then in s or after, either hold red_ball_2 or be in room_1. So the initial state s is when red_door_1 is locked, so we need in s or after, either hold red_ball_2 or be in room_1. Since the agent is in room_2 in s (initial state), they need to either go to room_1 (which they will do via yellow_door_1) or pick up red_ball_2. So maybe after going to room_1, which is after the initial state, that satisfies the condition. So as long as they go to room_1 after the initial state, that's okay.

3. Every state: not in room_4. So we must never go to room_4. So any gotoroom action that would take us there is forbidden.

4. At least one state in front of grey_door_1. That's part of the goal, so that's covered.

5. If in front of grey_door_1 in some state, then earlier state where holding some object or red_ball_4. So before we can be in front of grey_door_1, we need to have held some object or red_ball_4 at some earlier point. So maybe we need to pick up an object before getting to grey_door_1. Which object? The objects in room_3 are purple_ball_1 and yellow_box_1. Maybe pick up purple_ball_1, then drop it somewhere else, but maybe not necessary. Alternatively, in room_2, there's red_ball_4. But in room_2, can we pick up red_ball_4, then drop it later? But the agent needs to eventually get to room_3. So perhaps when moving from room_2 to room_1, then to room_3, but maybe we can pick up red_ball_4 in room_2, carry it to room_1, then drop it there. But that might complicate things. Alternatively, pick up red_ball_3 in room_2, which is required by another constraint (must be holding red_ball_3 in some state). So maybe that's part of the plan.

6. At least one state in room_2. The initial state is room_2, so that's covered. But the constraint says "in at least one state", which is already satisfied by the initial state.

7. If in room_2 in state s, then red_ball_3 must be in room_3 at s or after. So since the agent starts in room_2, and red_ball_3 is initially in room_2, we need to move red_ball_3 to room_3. So the agent must pick up red_ball_3, carry it to room_3, and drop it there. So that's a key part of the plan. Also, there's a constraint that the agent must hold red_ball_3 in at least one state, which is covered by picking it up.

8. At least one state holding red_ball_3. So that's part of moving it to room_3.

Putting this together:

The steps would be:

1. In room_2, go to yellow_door_1 (since it connects room_2 and room_1). But to go to a door, need to be in a room connected by the door. So gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_1.

But preconditions: the agent is in a room connected by the door (room_2 is connected via yellow_door_1 to room_1), and no object is blocking the position in front of the door in the current room (room_2). Are there any objects blocking doors? The initial state says that objects (balls and boxes) can block doors if they are in front of them. Wait, the preconditions for "goto door" is (ii) there is no object blocking the position in front of d in the current room. So in room_2, are any objects in front of the doors? The initial state doesn't mention any objects blocking doors. So I assume that objects are placed in their rooms, but not necessarily in front of doors. So unless specified, doors are not blocked. So we can go to the doors.

So first action: gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_1.

Then toggle yellow_door_1 to unlock it.

Then gotoroom room_2 room_1 yellow_door_1. Now in room_1.

Then go to purple_door_1 (connects room_1 and room_3). gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_3.

Toggle purple_door_1 to unlock.

Then gotoroom room_1 room_3 purple_door_1. Now in room_3.

Now, need to go to grey_door_1 in room_3. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4.

But before that, the constraint says that when in front of grey_door_1, there must have been a previous state where the agent was holding some object or red_ball_4. So perhaps before going to grey_door_1, the agent needs to pick up an object. But in room_3, the objects are purple_ball_1 and yellow_box_1. So pick up purple_ball_1. But to do that, need to go to it, pick it up, then maybe drop it.

But let's check:

In room_3, after arriving, the agent can gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_3, then pick it up. Then, perhaps drop it somewhere else. But why? Because if the agent is holding an object, then when they drop it, it's in the current room. Alternatively, maybe after picking up purple_ball_1, the agent can proceed to grey_door_1. But the constraint is that before being in front of grey_door_1, the agent must have held some object or red_ball_4. So picking up purple_ball_1 in room_3 would satisfy that.

Alternatively, maybe the agent can pick up red_ball_3 in room_2 first. Let's see:

The agent is in room_2 initially. They need to pick up red_ball_3 (to satisfy the constraint of holding it) and then move it to room_3. But to do that, they need to carry it through room_1 and room_3. So let's see:

Original plan steps:

1. gotoobject red_ball_3 room_2. Then pick it up. But wait, after that, the agent is holding red_ball_3. Then, proceed to unlock doors and move to room_3. Then drop red_ball_3 in room_3. That would satisfy the constraint that when in room_2 (initially), red_ball_3 is moved to room_3 after. Also, holding red_ball_3 in some state.

But let's integrate this into the plan.

So revised steps:

- Start in room_2.

1. gotoobject red_ball_3 room_2.

2. pick red_ball_3 room_2. Now holding it.

3. Then, proceed to unlock yellow_door_1. So gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_1.

But wait, after picking up red_ball_3, can the agent still go to the door? Because when you pick up an object, you are no longer in front of it. So after picking up red_ball_3, the agent is not in front of anything. So next, gotoempty? Or gotodoor.

Wait, after picking up, the agent is no longer in front of the object. So to go to the door, they need to go to it. So:

3. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_1.

4. toggle yellow_door_1 (unlock it).

5. gotoroom room_2 room_1 yellow_door_1. Now in room_1, carrying red_ball_3.

6. In room_1, need to go to purple_door_1. So gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_3.

7. toggle purple_door_1 (unlock).

8. gotoroom room_1 room_3 purple_door_1. Now in room_3, holding red_ball_3.

9. drop red_ball_3 room_3. To drop, need to be in front of an empty position. So maybe first gotoempty.

Wait, drop action requires that you are holding the object and the position in front is empty. So after entering room_3, the agent is in the room but not in front of anything. So to drop red_ball_3, need to be in front of an empty position. So:

9. gotoempty.

10. drop red_ball_3 room_3. Now red_ball_3 is in room_3.

Then, to handle the grey_door_1:

But before that, need to be in front of grey_door_1. So:

11. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4.

12. toggle grey_door_1 (unlock it).

Now, check the constraints:

- The goal is achieved: in front of grey_door_1 (grey), which is unlocked.

- The constraint that when in front of grey_door_1, the agent had held some object before. In this case, they held red_ball_3 earlier, which satisfies that.

- The red_ball_3 is now in room_3, so when the agent was in room_2 (initial state), after that, red_ball_3 is moved to room_3.

- The constraint about red_door_1 being locked in some state (it's always locked, since we never touch it). The initial state has red_door_1 locked. So in the initial state s, the agent is in room_2. To satisfy the constraint that if red_door_1 is locked in s, then in s or after, either hold red_ball_2 or be in room_1. Since the agent moves to room_1 in step 5, which is after the initial state, that satisfies the condition. So the constraint is met.

- The agent is never in room_4.

- Also, the agent was holding red_ball_3 (step 2), which satisfies the last constraint.

But wait, step 2 is picking red_ball_3, which is required. So that's covered.

Now, check all steps:

But wait, after step 8, the agent is in room_3, holding red_ball_3. To drop it, they need to be in front of an empty position. So steps 9 and 10: gotoempty and drop. But the drop action requires being in front of an empty position. When you gotoempty, you are in front of an empty position. Then, drop red_ball_3 room_3. That would place it there.

Then, proceed to grey_door_1.

But in step 11: gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4. Then toggle it. That's the final steps.

Wait, but after dropping the ball, the agent is in front of red_ball_3. Because after dropping, you are in front of it. So then, to go to the door, need to use gotodoor, which moves you in front of the door. So after step 10, the agent is in front of red_ball_3. So step 11 would be gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4. Then step 12: toggle.

This sequence should work.

Now, check the constraints again:

- When in front of grey_door_1 (step 11), the agent had previously held red_ball_3 (steps 2-10). So that satisfies the constraint.

- The red_ball_3 is in room_3 after step 10. So whenever the agent is in room_2 (initial state), which is before step 5, and after that, red_ball_3 is moved to room_3. So the constraint that if in room_2 (at any state s), then red_ball_3 is in room_3 at or after s. Since the agent leaves room_2 in step 5 and moves red_ball_3 to room_3 in step 10, this is satisfied.

- The agent was in room_2 in the initial state (satisfies the at least one state in room_2).

- The agent is never in room_4.

- The red_door_1 is locked throughout, so the constraint about it being locked in some state is satisfied by the initial state, and the conditional constraint is met because the agent goes to room_1 after the initial state.

- The agent held red_ball_3 (steps 2-10), satisfying that constraint.

So the plan is:

1. gotoobject red_ball_3 room_2

2. pick red_ball_3 room_2

3. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_1

4. toggle yellow_door_1

5. gotoroom room_2 room_1 yellow_door_1

6. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_3

7. toggle purple_door_1

8. gotoroom room_1 room_3 purple_door_1

9. gotoempty

10. drop red_ball_3 room_3

11. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4

12. toggle grey_door_1

This sequence should satisfy all constraints and the goal. Let me check each step.

Step 1: gotoobject red_ball_3 in room_2. Possible since agent is in room_2.

Step 2: pick it up. Hands are empty, so possible.

Step 3: gotodoor yellow_door_1 in room_2. Possible since the door connects room_2 and room_1, and no object is blocking.

Step 4: toggle door. Now yellow_door_1 is unlocked.

Step 5: move to room_1. Door is unlocked.

Step 6: gotodoor purple_door_1 in room_1. Possible, door connects room_1 and room_3, no blocking.

Step 7: toggle to unlock.

Step 8: move to room_3.

Step 9: gotoempty in room_3. Possible.

Step 10: drop red_ball_3. Since holding it and in front of empty spot.

Step 11: gotodoor grey_door_1 in room_3. Possible, door connects room_3 and room_4.

Step 12: toggle to unlock. Now grey_door_1 is unlocked and agent is in front of it. Goal achieved.

Constraints check:

- red_door_1 remains locked. At least one state (initial) has it locked. Check.

- In the initial state s (room_2, red_door_1 locked), after s, the agent goes to room_1. So the condition is met.

- Never in room_4. Check.

- In front of grey_door_1 (step 11). Check.

- Before step 11, agent held red_ball_3 (steps 2-10). Check.

- At least one state in room_2 (initial). Check.

- When in room_2 (initial), red_ball_3 is moved to room_3 later. Check.

- Agent held red_ball_3. Check.

So this plan should work. Now, is there a shorter plan? Let's see. For example, can we avoid dropping red_ball_3 and carry it when toggling grey_door_1? Because step 11 requires gotodoor, which is possible even if holding an object. But the toggle action only requires being in front of the door. So maybe steps 9 and 10 can be skipped, and instead, after step 8 (in room_3, holding red_ball_3), go directly to grey_door_1. Then toggle. But then when you drop the ball, you need to be in front of an empty spot. Wait, but in this case, after step 8, the agent is in room_3, holding red_ball_3. They can go to grey_door_1:

8. gotoroom room_1 room_3 purple_door_1 (now in room_3, holding red_ball_3)

9. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4

10. toggle grey_door_1 (unlock)

But then, the agent is in front of grey_door_1, which is unlocked. So the goal is achieved. But what about dropping red_ball_3 in room_3? The constraint says that if in room_2 (which is only in the initial state here), then red_ball_3 must be in room_3 at s or after. So if the agent is holding red_ball_3 when in room_3, but hasn't dropped it yet, does that count as red_ball_3 being in room_3? No, because when you're holding it, it's not in any room. So to satisfy the constraint, the agent must drop it in room_3. Therefore, steps 9 and 10 (gotoempty and drop) are necessary. So the original plan is needed. Therefore, the plan length is 12 steps. But is there a way to shorten it?

Alternatively, after step 8 (in room_3, holding red_ball_3), can the agent drop it immediately without gotoempty? Because when you enter a room, you are not in front of anything. So to drop, you need to be in front of an empty position. So gotoempty is required before dropping. So steps 9 and 10 are necessary.

Thus, the original plan is optimal. Now, let's write it in the required format.
