Alright, I need to plan a sequence of actions to achieve the goal while satisfying all the given constraints. Let me break down the problem:

**Goal**: "There is a door d such that "The following conditions are all true: "d is grey", "you are in front of d", "d is not locked"""

This means I need to be in front of grey_door_1 and it should be unlocked.

Now, let's look at the constraints:

1. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: "red_door_1 is locked"":
   - This is already true in the initial state, so we don't need to do anything special here.

2. "If expression "red_door_1 is locked" holds in some state s, then expression "At least one of the following conditions is true: "you are holding red_ball_2", "you are in room_1"" must hold at s or at some state after s":
   - Since red_door_1 is locked in the initial state, we need to either pick up red_ball_2 or go to room_1 at some point.

3. "The following expression must hold in every state: "you are not in room_4"":
   - We should avoid going to room_4.

4. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: "you are in front of grey_door_1"":
   - This aligns with our goal.

5. "If expression "you are in front of grey_door_1" holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: "At least one of the following conditions is true: "you are holding some object", "you are holding red_ball_4"":
   - Before being in front of grey_door_1, we need to hold an object, specifically red_ball_4 is mentioned.

6. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: "you are in room_2"":
   - This is true in the initial state.

7. "If expression "you are in room_2" holds in some state s, then expression "red_ball_3 is in room_3" must hold at s or at some state after s":
   - We need to move red_ball_3 to room_3 at some point after or while we're in room_2.

8. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: "you are holding red_ball_3"":
   - We need to pick up red_ball_3 at some point.

Given the layout of the rooms and the objects, let me plan the sequence of actions:

Initial state: We are in room_2, and all doors are locked.

Let's start by planning how to meet the constraints:

1. We're already in room_2 (satisfying constraint 6).
2. We need to pick up red_ball_3 (constraint 8) and move it to room_3 (constraint 7).
3. We also need to pick up red_ball_4 (or any object) before being in front of grey_door_1 (constraint 5).
4. We can't go to room_4 (constraint 3).
5. We need to either pick up red_ball_2 or go to room_1 after red_door_1 is locked (constraint 2).
6. The goal is to be in front of grey_door_1 and it should be unlocked.

Let's break it down into a step-by-step plan:

1. We're in room_2. First, we'll pick up red_ball_3.
2. We'll navigate to yellow_door_1 (connecting room_2 and room_1).
3. We'll unlock yellow_door_1.
4. We'll go to room_1 (satisfying constraint 2, as red_door_1 is still locked).
5. We'll navigate to purple_door_1 (connecting room_1 and room_3).
6. We'll unlock purple_door_1.
7. We'll go to room_3.
8. We'll drop red_ball_3 in room_3 (satisfying constraint 7).
9. We'll pick up red_ball_4 (satisfying part of constraint 5).
10. We'll navigate to grey_door_1 (connecting room_3 and room_4).
11. We'll unlock grey_door_1.
12. We'll be in front of grey_door_1 with it unlocked (achieving the goal).

Now, let's validate and refine this plan:

Actually, there's an issue. red_ball_4 is in room_2, not in room_3. So, we need to pick it up in room_2 before going to room_3. Let's adjust:

1. We're in room_2. First, we'll go to red_ball_3.
2. We'll pick up red_ball_3.
3. We'll go to the position in front of yellow_door_1.
4. We'll unlock yellow_door_1.
5. We'll go to room_1.
6. We'll navigate to purple_door_1.
7. We'll unlock purple_door_1.
8. We'll go to room_3.
9. We'll drop red_ball_3 in room_3.
10. We'll go back to room_1.
11. We'll go back to room_2.
12. We'll go to red_ball_4.
13. We'll pick up red_ball_4.
14. We'll go to yellow_door_1.
15. We'll go to room_1.
16. We'll go to purple_door_1.
17. We'll go to room_3.
18. We'll go to grey_door_1.
19. We'll unlock grey_door_1.
20. We are now in front of unlocked grey_door_1.

But there's a problem again: we don't follow the constraint "The following expression must hold in every state: "you are not in room_4"". But the way we set up the plan, we don't actually need to go to room_4, so we're good.

Let's revise the plan a bit further to ensure we satisfy all constraints:

Actually, let's be even more careful and think step by step. 

We are initially in room_2 with all the following objects:
- grey_ball_1
- red_ball_2
- red_ball_3
- red_ball_4

First, we need to pick up red_ball_3 and take it to room_3 (to satisfy constraint 7). But to get to room_3 from room_2, we need to go through either room_1 or room_4. Given that we can't go to room_4 (constraint 3), we'll go through room_1.

To get to room_1, we need to go through yellow_door_1, which is currently locked. Let's unlock it.

But now I'm thinking that to pick up red_ball_4 (constraint 5), I'll have to return to room_2. So, maybe it's more efficient to pick up red_ball_4 first, before taking red_ball_3 to room_3. However, the constraint says: "If expression "you are in front of grey_door_1" holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: "At least one of the following conditions is true: "you are holding some object", "you are holding red_ball_4"". This doesn't necessarily mean I need to be holding red_ball_4 when I'm in front of grey_door_1; it just means I need to have held an object (or specifically red_ball_4) at some earlier state.

Here's a revised plan:

1. We're in room_2. First, we'll go to red_ball_4.
2. We'll pick up red_ball_4 (satisfying constraint 5 for a future state).
3. We'll go to the position in front of yellow_door_1.
4. We'll drop red_ball_4 (to free our hands).
5. We'll go to red_ball_3.
6. We'll pick up red_ball_3 (satisfying constraint 8).
7. We'll go to yellow_door_1.
8. We'll toggle yellow_door_1 to unlock it.
9. We'll go to room_1 (satisfying constraint 2, as red_door_1 is still locked).
10. We'll go to purple_door_1.
11. We'll toggle purple_door_1 to unlock it.
12. We'll go to room_3.
13. We'll drop red_ball_3 in room_3 (satisfying constraint 7).
14. We'll go to grey_door_1.
15. We'll toggle grey_door_1 to unlock it.
16. We are now in front of unlocked grey_door_1 (achieving the goal).

Wait, let's double-check this plan against all constraints:

1. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: "red_door_1 is locked"" - Satisfied (it's locked in the initial state).
2. "If expression "red_door_1 is locked" holds in some state s, then expression "At least one of the following conditions is true: "you are holding red_ball_2", "you are in room_1"" must hold at s or at some state after s" - We go to room_1 in step 9, satisfying this.
3. "The following expression must hold in every state: "you are not in room_4"" - We never go to room_4, so this is satisfied.
4. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: "you are in front of grey_door_1"" - Satisfied in step 15-16.
5. "If expression "you are in front of grey_door_1" holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: "At least one of the following conditions is true: "you are holding some object", "you are holding red_ball_4"" - We pick up red_ball_4 in step 2 and later we're in front of grey_door_1, so this is satisfied.
6. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: "you are in room_2"" - Satisfied (it's true in the initial state).
7. "If expression "you are in room_2" holds in some state s, then expression "red_ball_3 is in room_3" must hold at s or at some state after s" - We drop red_ball_3 in room_3 in step 13, which is after the initial state where we are in room_2, so this is satisfied.
8. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: "you are holding red_ball_3"" - Satisfied in step 6.

Let me double-check a couple of things:

I notice there's a potential issue with steps 3 and 4. We're trying to go to the position in front of yellow_door_1 and then drop red_ball_4 there. But we can only drop an object if the position in front of us is empty. If we're in front of yellow_door_1, then the position in front of us is not empty (it's occupied by the door). So we can't drop red_ball_4 there. I think we need to revise this part.

Revised plan:

1. We're in room_2. First, we'll go to red_ball_4.
2. We'll pick up red_ball_4 (satisfying constraint 5 for a future state).
3. We'll go to the position of an empty slot.
4. We'll drop red_ball_4 there (to free our hands).
5. We'll go to red_ball_3.
6. We'll pick up red_ball_3 (satisfying constraint 8).
7. We'll go to yellow_door_1.
8. We'll toggle yellow_door_1 to unlock it.
9. We'll go to room_1 (satisfying constraint 2, as red_door_1 is still locked).
10. We'll go to purple_door_1.
11. We'll toggle purple_door_1 to unlock it.
12. We'll go to room_3.
13. We'll drop red_ball_3 in room_3 (satisfying constraint 7).
14. We'll go to grey_door_1.
15. We'll toggle grey_door_1 to unlock it.
16. We are now in front of unlocked grey_door_1 (achieving the goal).

Actually, I'm noticing an oversight in my reasoning. The "If expression X holds in some state s, then expression Y must hold at s or at some state after s" constraints imply a temporal ordering. For instance, if "you are in room_2" holds in the initial state (which it does), then "red_ball_3 is in room_3" must be true at that state or a later state. This is different from saying "if you have ever been in room_2, then at some point later red_ball_3 must be in room_3."

However, since the agent is in room_2 in the initial state, the constraint "If expression "you are in room_2" holds in some state s, then expression "red_ball_3 is in room_3" must hold at s or at some state after s" means that we need to ensure that red_ball_3 is in room_3 at some point after the start.

Let's redo the plan:

Let me be methodical and formulate a precise plan step by step. I'll reason about the preconditions and effects of each action and identify any potential issues.

**Initial State**:
- We are in room_2.
- red_ball_3 is in room_2.
- red_ball_4 is in room_2.
- All doors are locked.

**Goal**:
- Be in front of grey_door_1, which should be unlocked.

**Constraints to satisfy**:
1. Hold red_ball_3 at some point.
2. Hold red_ball_4 (or any object) at some point before being in front of grey_door_1.
3. Move red_ball_3 to room_3 after or while being in room_2.
4. Never go to room_4.
5. Either hold red_ball_2 or be in room_1 after or while red_door_1 is locked.

**Plan**:
1. `gotoobject red_ball_4 room_2` - Go to red_ball_4 in room_2.
2. `pick red_ball_4 room_2` - Pick up red_ball_4.
3. `gotoempty` - Go to an empty position.
4. `drop red_ball_4 room_2` - Drop red_ball_4 to free our hands.
5. `gotoobject red_ball_3 room_2` - Go to red_ball_3.
6. `pick red_ball_3 room_2` - Pick up red_ball_3.
7. `gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_1` - Go to yellow_door_1.
8. `toggle yellow_door_1` - Unlock yellow_door_1.
9. `gotoroom room_2 room_1 yellow_door_1` - Go to room_1.
10. `gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_3` - Go to purple_door_1.
11. `toggle purple_door_1` - Unlock purple_door_1.
12. `gotoroom room_1 room_3 purple_door_1` - Go to room_3.
13. `gotoempty` - Go to an empty position in room_3.
14. `drop red_ball_3 room_3` - Drop red_ball_3 in room_3.
15. `gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4` - Go to grey_door_1.
16. `toggle grey_door_1` - Unlock grey_door_1.

This plan should achieve the goal and satisfy all the constraints. Let's double-check:

1. We hold red_ball_3 in step 6.
2. We hold red_ball_4 in step 2, before being in front of grey_door_1 in step 15.
3. We drop red_ball_3 in room_3 in step 14, which is after the initial state where we're in room_2.
4. We never go to room_4.
5. We go to room_1 in step 9, while red_door_1 is still locked.
6. We're in front of unlocked grey_door_1 at the end.

Let me make sure the plan meets all the constraints and achieves the goal:

1. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: "red_door_1 is locked"" - Satisfied (it's locked in the initial state).
2. "If expression "red_door_1 is locked" holds in some state s, then expression "At least one of the following conditions is true: "you are holding red_ball_2", "you are in room_1"" must hold at s or at some state after s" - We go to room_1 in step 9, satisfying this.
3. "The following expression must hold in every state: "you are not in room_4"" - We never go to room_4, so this is satisfied.
4. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: "you are in front of grey_door_1"" - Satisfied in step 15.
5. "If expression "you are in front of grey_door_1" holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: "At least one of the following conditions is true: "you are holding some object", "you are holding red_ball_4"" - We pick up red_ball_4 in step 2, which is before we're in front of grey_door_1 in step 15, so this is satisfied.
6. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: "you are in room_2"" - Satisfied (it's true in the initial state).
7. "If expression "you are in room_2" holds in some state s, then expression "red_ball_3 is in room_3" must hold at s or at some state after s" - We drop red_ball_3 in room_3 in step 14, which is after the initial state where we are in room_2, so this is satisfied.
8. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: "you are holding red_ball_3"" - Satisfied in step 6.

The goal is to have a door d such that "d is grey", "you are in front of d", and "d is not locked". After our plan, we're in front of grey_door_1, which is grey and unlocked.

I think this plan should work. Here's the final plan:

1. `gotoobject red_ball_4 room_2` - Go to red_ball_4 in room_2.
2. `pick red_ball_4 room_2` - Pick up red_ball_4.
3. `gotoempty` - Go to an empty position.
4. `drop red_ball_4 room_2` - Drop red_ball_4 to free our hands.
5. `gotoobject red_ball_3 room_2` - Go to red_ball_3.
6. `pick red_ball_3 room_2` - Pick up red_ball_3.
7. `gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_1` - Go to yellow_door_1.
8. `toggle yellow_door_1` - Unlock yellow_door_1.
9. `gotoroom room_2 room_1 yellow_door_1` - Go to room_1.
10. `gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_3` - Go to purple_door_1.
11. `toggle purple_door_1` - Unlock purple_door_1.
12. `gotoroom room_1 room_3 purple_door_1` - Go to room_3.
13. `gotoempty` - Go to an empty position in room_3.
14. `drop red_ball_3 room_3` - Drop red_ball_3 in room_3.
15. `gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4` - Go to grey_door_1.
16. `toggle grey_door_1` - Unlock grey_door_1.
