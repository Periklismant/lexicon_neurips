Alright, let's understand the problem step by step.

First, the gridworld consists of 4 rooms in a square formation: room_1 (north-west), room_2 (south-west), room_3 (north-east), and room_4 (south-east). The rooms are connected by doors. Each door, box, and ball has a color.

**Initial State**:
- You are in room_1.
- red_box_1 and yellow_box_1 are in room_1.
- grey_ball_1 and grey_ball_2 are in room_2.
- grey_ball_3 is in room_3.
- green_box_1, yellow_ball_1, and green_ball_1 are in room_4.
- All doors (blue_door_1, red_door_1, purple_door_1, blue_door_2) are locked.
- You are not holding any object.

**Goal**:
- You are in room_2.
- You are in front of a grey ball in room_2.

**Constraints**:
1. You must at some point be in front of yellow_box_1.
2. You must at some point be in front of blue_door_1.
3. Before you can be in front of blue_door_1, you must hold grey_ball_3.
4. You must observe blue_door_1 in a locked state at some point.
5. If blue_door_1 is locked in some state, then at that state or later, you must either be in room_4 or holding some object.
6. You must hold red_box_1 at some point.
7. You must observe blue_door_1 in an unlocked state at some point.
8. Before blue_door_1 can be unlocked, you must hold yellow_ball_1.

Let's first analyze how we can reach our goal. We need to be in room_2 and be in front of one of the grey balls there (grey_ball_1 or grey_ball_2). But all doors are locked initially, so we need to unlock some doors to get there.

Let's check the constraints for any implications on our plan:

1. You must be in front of yellow_box_1, which is in room_1. This is straightforward since you're already in room_1.
2. You must be in front of blue_door_1 (which connects room_1 and room_2). Given that you're already in room_1, this is also manageable.
3. Before being in front of blue_door_1, you must hold grey_ball_3. But grey_ball_3 is in room_3. So you need to get to room_3 first.
4. You must see blue_door_1 in a locked state, which it is initially.
5. After seeing blue_door_1 locked, you must either go to room_4 or pick up an object. Given the current state, picking up an object seems easier since you're in room_1 and there are two boxes there.
6. You must hold red_box_1, which is in room_1. This aligns with the previous constraint.
7. You must see blue_door_1 in an unlocked state. Since all doors are locked initially, you'll need to unlock it.
8. Before blue_door_1 can be unlocked, you must hold yellow_ball_1. But yellow_ball_1 is in room_4. So you need to get to room_4 first.

Hmm, this seems to have a circular dependency. You need to hold grey_ball_3 before being in front of blue_door_1, but to get grey_ball_3 (which is in room_3), you need to unlock red_door_1 first. And to unlock blue_door_1, you need to hold yellow_ball_1, which is in room_4. But to get to room_4, you need to either go through room_2 (which requires unlocking blue_door_1) or through room_3 (which requires unlocking red_door_1).

Let's think about this more:

1. To start, you're in room_1.
2. You can pick up red_box_1 and yellow_box_1 from room_1.
3. You need to unlock doors to get to other rooms.
4. To unlock blue_door_1, you need to hold yellow_ball_1 first, which is in room_4.
5. To get to room_4, you can go through room_2 (via blue_door_1) or room_3 (via red_door_1 and then blue_door_2).
6. But to be in front of blue_door_1, you need to hold grey_ball_3 first, which is in room_3.
7. So, you need to get to room_3 first, which requires unlocking red_door_1.

But you need to unlock blue_door_1 to continue, and to do that, you need to hold yellow_ball_1 first, which is in room_4. It seems we have a circular dependency here.

But let me check if I'm missing something:

1. Starting in room_1, you can pick up objects and be in front of doors there.
2. To get to room_3, you need to unlock red_door_1. You can do this by toggling it, as there's no constraint on when it can be unlocked.
3. Once in room_3, you can pick up grey_ball_3.
4. With grey_ball_3, you can go back to room_1 and be in front of blue_door_1, satisfying constraint 3.
5. To unlock blue_door_1, you first need to hold yellow_ball_1 (constraint 8), which is in room_4.
6. To get to room_4, you can go through room_3 and unlock blue_door_2.
7. Once in room_4, you can pick up yellow_ball_1.
8. With yellow_ball_1, you can unlock blue_door_1.
9. Then, you can go to room_2 and be in front of one of the grey balls, achieving the goal.

I think I've been overthinking this. Let's try to draw out a step-by-step plan:

1. In room_1, gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_1 (to satisfy constraint 1)
2. gotoempty (to prepare for picking red_box_1)
3. gotoobject red_box_1 room_1
4. pick red_box_1 room_1 (to satisfy constraint 6)
5. gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3
6. drop red_box_1 room_1 (to free your hands for toggling)
7. toggle red_door_1 (to unlock it)
8. gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1
9. gotoobject grey_ball_3 room_3
10. pick grey_ball_3 room_3 (to satisfy constraint 3)
11. gotodoor blue_door_2 room_3 room_4
12. drop grey_ball_3 room_3 (to free your hands for toggling)
13. toggle blue_door_2 (to unlock it)
14. gotoroom room_3 room_4 blue_door_2
15. gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_4
16. pick yellow_ball_1 room_4 (to satisfy constraint 8)
17. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_2
18. toggle purple_door_1 (to unlock it)
19. gotoroom room_4 room_2 purple_door_1
20. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_2
21. drop yellow_ball_1 room_2 (to free your hands for further actions)
22. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1
23. gotoroom room_2 room_1 blue_door_1 (Wait, this requires blue_door_1 to be unlocked, but it's locked. Let's fix this.)

Actually, I need to be more careful here. Let's replan from the beginning.

1. In room_1, gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_1 (to satisfy constraint 1)
2. gotoempty (to prepare for picking red_box_1)
3. gotoobject red_box_1 room_1
4. pick red_box_1 room_1 (to satisfy constraint 6, and constraint 5)
5. gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3
6. drop red_box_1 room_1 (to free your hands for toggling)
7. toggle red_door_1 (to unlock it)
8. gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1
9. gotoobject grey_ball_3 room_3
10. pick grey_ball_3 room_3 (to satisfy constraint 3)
11. gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1
12. gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1
13. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2
14. drop grey_ball_3 room_1 (to free your hands for toggling)
15. Here, we satisfy constraint 2: being in front of blue_door_1, and constraint 4: observing blue_door_1 in a locked state.
16. gotoempty (to prepare for picking up grey_ball_3 again)
17. gotoobject grey_ball_3 room_1
18. pick grey_ball_3 room_1
19. gotodoor blue_door_2 room_1 room_3 (Wait, this doesn't make sense. Let's rethink.)

Wait, this is getting confusing. Let me take a step back and think about this differently. 

Let's look at the constraints again:
1. At some point, you must be in front of yellow_box_1.
2. At some point, you must be in front of blue_door_1.
3. Before being in front of blue_door_1, you must hold grey_ball_3.
4. At some point, you must observe blue_door_1 as locked.
5. After seeing blue_door_1 locked, you must be in room_4 or hold an object.
6. At some point, you must hold red_box_1.
7. At some point, you must observe blue_door_1 as unlocked.
8. Before blue_door_1 can be unlocked, you must hold yellow_ball_1.

We need to fulfill these constraints while moving towards our goal of being in room_2 and in front of a grey ball.

Given the initial state, let's start by satisfying the simpler constraints:

1. Satisfy constraint 1: Be in front of yellow_box_1.
   - gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_1
   
2. Satisfy constraint 6: Hold red_box_1.
   - gotoempty
   - gotoobject red_box_1 room_1
   - pick red_box_1 room_1

Now, we have red_box_1 in our hands, which also satisfies constraint 5 (holding an object after seeing blue_door_1 as locked). Next, we need to get grey_ball_3 which is in room_3, and to do that, we need to unlock red_door_1.

3. Unlock red_door_1 to get to room_3.
   - gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3
   - drop red_box_1 room_1 (to free our hands for toggling)
   - toggle red_door_1
   - gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1

4. Satisfy constraint 3: Hold grey_ball_3.
   - gotoobject grey_ball_3 room_3
   - pick grey_ball_3 room_3

5. Return to room_1 and satisfy constraint 2 and 4: Be in front of blue_door_1 and observe it as locked.
   - gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1
   - gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1
   - gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2

Now, we need to get yellow_ball_1 (which is in room_4) to unlock blue_door_1. To do this, we can use blue_door_2 connecting room_3 and room_4.

6. Go to room_4 to get yellow_ball_1.
   - gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3
   - gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1
   - gotodoor blue_door_2 room_3 room_4
   - drop grey_ball_3 room_3 (to free our hands for toggling)
   - toggle blue_door_2
   - gotoroom room_3 room_4 blue_door_2
   - gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_4
   - pick yellow_ball_1 room_4

7. Satisfy constraint 8: Hold yellow_ball_1 before unlocking blue_door_1.
   - gotodoor blue_door_2 room_4 room_3
   - gotoroom room_4 room_3 blue_door_2
   - gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1
   - gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1
   - gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2
   - toggle blue_door_1 (now blue_door_1 is unlocked, satisfying constraint 7)

8. Reach the goal: Be in room_2 and in front of a grey ball.
   - gotoroom room_1 room_2 blue_door_1
   - gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_2
   - drop yellow_ball_1 room_2 (to be in front of grey_ball_1)

That seems right, but before I provide the final plan, let me double-check for any inconsistencies or issues. 

Wait, I notice I'm a bit confused on point 5 above. If we hold grey_ball_3 and go to blue_door_1, then we'll be in front of blue_door_1 while holding grey_ball_3, which satisfies constraint 3. But constraints 4 and 5 say we need to see blue_door_1 as locked, and after that, either be in room_4 or hold an object. If we try to toggle blue_door_1 at this point, we'd need to drop grey_ball_3, and then we'd no longer be holding any object. To be precise, after seeing blue_door_1 as locked, we'd drop grey_ball_3, which means we wouldn't be in room_4 or holding an object anymore.

But wait, I think I'm overthinking this. The constraints say "After seeing blue_door_1 as locked, at some point you must be in room_4 or holding an object." So, it's not immediate. We can see blue_door_1 as locked, drop grey_ball_3, toggle blue_door_1, and then later satisfy the constraint by going to room_4 or picking up an object again.

So, let's continue with the plan:

5. Return to room_1 and satisfy constraint 2 and 4: Be in front of blue_door_1 and observe it as locked. Also, get yellow_ball_1 to satisfy constraint 8.
   - gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1
   - gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1
   - gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2
   (Now we're in front of blue_door_1 while it's locked, which satisfies constraints 2 and 4.)
   - gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3
   - gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1
   - gotodoor blue_door_2 room_3 room_4
   - drop grey_ball_3 room_3 (to free our hands for toggling)
   - toggle blue_door_2
   - gotoroom room_3 room_4 blue_door_2
   - gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_4
   - pick yellow_ball_1 room_4
   (Now we're holding yellow_ball_1, which will allow us to unlock blue_door_1 later. This also satisfies constraint 5 indirectly, as we're in room_4 after seeing blue_door_1 as locked.)

6. Return to blue_door_1 and unlock it.
   - gotodoor blue_door_2 room_4 room_3
   - gotoroom room_4 room_3 blue_door_2
   - gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1
   - gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1
   - gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2
   - toggle blue_door_1 (now blue_door_1 is unlocked, satisfying constraint 7)

7. Reach the goal: Be in room_2 and in front of a grey ball.
   - gotoroom room_1 room_2 blue_door_1
   - gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_2
   - drop yellow_ball_1 room_2 (so we're in front of grey_ball_1)

Actually, I realized there's a more straightforward way to satisfy constraint 5. After seeing blue_door_1 as locked, we can simply continue holding grey_ball_3. Then, constraint 5 requires us to either be in room_4 or holding an object, and we're satisfying the holding part by holding grey_ball_3.

Let's refine the plan one more time:

1. Satisfy constraint 1: Be in front of yellow_box_1.
   - gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_1
   
2. Satisfy constraint 6: Hold red_box_1.
   - gotoempty
   - gotoobject red_box_1 room_1
   - pick red_box_1 room_1

3. Unlock red_door_1 to get to room_3.
   - gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3
   - drop red_box_1 room_1 (to free our hands for toggling)
   - toggle red_door_1
   - gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1

4. Satisfy constraint 3: Hold grey_ball_3.
   - gotoobject grey_ball_3 room_3
   - pick grey_ball_3 room_3

5. Return to room_1 and satisfy constraint 2 and 4: Be in front of blue_door_1 and observe it as locked. This also satisfies constraint 5 since we're holding grey_ball_3.
   - gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1
   - gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1
   - gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2
   (Now we're in front of blue_door_1 while it's locked and holding grey_ball_3, which satisfies constraints 2, 3, 4, and 5.)

6. Get yellow_ball_1 to satisfy constraint 8 before unlocking blue_door_1.
   - gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3
   - gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1
   - gotodoor blue_door_2 room_3 room_4
   - drop grey_ball_3 room_3 (to free our hands for toggling)
   - toggle blue_door_2
   - gotoroom room_3 room_4 blue_door_2
   - gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_4
   - pick yellow_ball_1 room_4

7. Return to blue_door_1 and unlock it.
   - gotodoor blue_door_2 room_4 room_3
   - gotoroom room_4 room_3 blue_door_2
   - gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1
   - gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1
   - gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2
   - toggle blue_door_1 (now blue_door_1 is unlocked, satisfying constraint 7)

8. Reach the goal: Be in room_2 and in front of a grey ball.
   - gotoroom room_1 room_2 blue_door_1
   - drop yellow_ball_1 room_2 (to free our hands)
   - gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_2
   (Now we're in room_2 and in front of grey_ball_1, satisfying our goal.)

After carefully thinking through the problem once more, I believe this plan satisfies all the constraints and achieves the goal. Let's finalize it:

```
gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_1
gotoempty
gotoobject red_box_1 room_1
pick red_box_1 room_1
gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3
drop red_box_1 room_1
toggle red_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1
gotoobject grey_ball_3 room_3
pick grey_ball_3 room_3
gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1
gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1
gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2
gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3
gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1
gotodoor blue_door_2 room_3 room_4
drop grey_ball_3 room_3
toggle blue_door_2
gotoroom room_3 room_4 blue_door_2
gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_4
pick yellow_ball_1 room_4
gotodoor blue_door_2 room_4 room_3
gotoroom room_4 room_3 blue_door_2
gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1
gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1
gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2
toggle blue_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_2 blue_door_1
drop yellow_ball_1 room_2
gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_2
```

Actually, there's a small issue here. After dropping yellow_ball_1 in room_2, we need to explicitly go to grey_ball_1. But after dropping yellow_ball_1, we're already in front of it, so we can't immediately go to grey_ball_1. We need to go to an empty position first.

Correcting the last part:

```
gotoroom room_1 room_2 blue_door_1
gotoempty
drop yellow_ball_1 room_2
gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_2
```

Wait, but that doesn't sound right either. After dropping an object, we're automatically in front of it. So, after dropping yellow_ball_1, we are in front of it, not at an empty position. Let me review the actions again.

Ok, so the "drop" action has the effect: "(i) you are no longer carrying x, (ii) you are in front of x, (iii) your hands are empty, and (iv) object x is situated in the room you are currently in."

So, after dropping yellow_ball_1, we're in front of it, not at an empty position. We need to move to an empty position first, then move to grey_ball_1.

Correcting the last part again:

```
gotoroom room_1 room_2 blue_door_1
drop yellow_ball_1 room_2
gotoempty
gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_2
```

Ok, let's review the whole plan once more:

1. Go to yellow_box_1 to satisfy constraint 1.
2. Move to an empty position to prepare for picking red_box_1.
3. Go to red_box_1.
4. Pick up red_box_1 to satisfy constraint 6.
5. Go to red_door_1.
6. Drop red_box_1 to free our hands.
7. Toggle red_door_1 to unlock it.
8. Go to room_3 via red_door_1.
9. Go to grey_ball_3.
10. Pick up grey_ball_3 to satisfy constraint 3.
11. Go to red_door_1 from room_3.
12. Return to room_1 via red_door_1.
13. Go to blue_door_1 while holding grey_ball_3. This satisfies constraints 2, 3, 4, and 5.
14. Go to red_door_1 again from room_1.
15. Return to room_3 via red_door_1.
16. Go to blue_door_2 from room_3.
17. Drop grey_ball_3 to free our hands.
18. Toggle blue_door_2 to unlock it.
19. Go to room_4 via blue_door_2.
20. Go to yellow_ball_1.
21. Pick up yellow_ball_1 to satisfy constraint 8.
22. Go to blue_door_2 from room_4.
23. Return to room_3 via blue_door_2.
24. Go to red_door_1 from room_3.
25. Return to room_1 via red_door_1.
26. Go to blue_door_1 from room_1.
27. Toggle blue_door_1 to unlock it, satisfying constraint 7.
28. Go to room_2 via blue_door_1.
29. Drop yellow_ball_1 in room_2.
30. Go to an empty position.
31. Go to grey_ball_1 to satisfy the goal.

But there's an issue here. After step 29, we're in front of yellow_ball_1. To go to grey_ball_1, we need to move to an empty position first. However, I realized I'm not familiar with the layout of the room or the exact positions of the objects, so I'm not sure if we need to go to an empty position first or if we can directly go to grey_ball_1 from yellow_ball_1's position.

Let's assume the worst case and say we need to move to an empty position first. In that case, the plan would be:

```
gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_1
gotoempty
gotoobject red_box_1 room_1
pick red_box_1 room_1
gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3
drop red_box_1 room_1
toggle red_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1
gotoobject grey_ball_3 room_3
pick grey_ball_3 room_3
gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1
gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1
gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2
gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3
gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1
gotodoor blue_door_2 room_3 room_4
drop grey_ball_3 room_3
toggle blue_door_2
gotoroom room_3 room_4 blue_door_2
gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_4
pick yellow_ball_1 room_4
gotodoor blue_door_2 room_4 room_3
gotoroom room_4 room_3 blue_door_2
gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1
gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1
gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2
toggle blue_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_2 blue_door_1
drop yellow_ball_1 room_2
gotoempty
gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_2
```

But wait, I'm not sure if we need to drop yellow_ball_1 before the end. The goal is to be in room_2 and in front of a grey ball. It doesn't specify that we shouldn't be holding anything. Actually, I'm overthinking this. Let me reread the goal carefully.

The goal is: "There is a ball v such that "The following conditions are all true: "v is grey", "v is in room_2", "you are in room_2", "you are in front of v"""

This means we need to be in room_2 and be in front of a grey ball in room_2. It doesn't say anything about not holding an object. Actually, the "pick" action says "you are no longer in front of x", so if we pick up a grey ball, we won't be in front of it anymore, which wouldn't satisfy the goal.

Our plan above still seems good. We get to room_2, and we're in front of grey_ball_1, which satisfies our goal. And all the constraints are satisfied along the way.

Actually, in step 30, I added "gotoempty". But rereading the description of the "drop" action, after dropping yellow_ball_1, we're in front of it. We need to move to an empty position and then go to grey_ball_1. So, step 30 is correct.

Now let's check for redundancies or inefficiencies in our plan, because it seems quite lengthy. Let's see if there's a shorter path:

I wonder if we can get grey_ball_3 and also use the opportunity to get yellow_ball_1 directly, instead of going back and forth a few times. 

1. Go to and toggle red_door_1 to get to room_3.
2. Pick up grey_ball_3 in room_3.
3. Toggle blue_door_2 to get to room_4.
4. Pick up yellow_ball_1 in room_4 (dropping grey_ball_3 first).
5. Go back to room_3, then to room_1.
6. Go to blue_door_1 to satisfy constraint 2, 4.
7. Toggle blue_door_1 using yellow_ball_1 to satisfy constraint 7, 8.
8. Go to room_2 and in front of grey_ball_1 or grey_ball_2 to satisfy the goal.

Hmm, but this doesn't allow us to see blue_door_1 locked while holding grey_ball_3 (to satisfy constraints 3 and 5 together). 

Actually, I think the plan I previously outlined is already quite efficient. Let's stick with it:

```
gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_1
gotoempty
gotoobject red_box_1 room_1
pick red_box_1 room_1
gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3
drop red_box_1 room_1
toggle red_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1
gotoobject grey_ball_3 room_3
pick grey_ball_3 room_3
gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1
gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1
gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2
gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3
gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1
gotodoor blue_door_2 room_3 room_4
drop grey_ball_3 room_3
toggle blue_door_2
gotoroom room_3 room_4 blue_door_2
gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_4
pick yellow_ball_1 room_4
gotodoor blue_door_2 room_4 room_3
gotoroom room_4 room_3 blue_door_2
gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1
gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1
gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2
toggle blue_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_2 blue_door_1
drop yellow_ball_1 room_2
gotoempty
gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_2
```

This plan seems to satisfy all constraints and achieve the goal. Let's double-check to be sure:

1. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: "you are in front of yellow_box_1"" ✓ (Step 1)
2. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: "you are in front of blue_door_1"" ✓ (Step 13, 26)
3. "If expression "you are in front of blue_door_1" holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: "you are holding grey_ball_3"" ✓ (Step 10 is before Steps 13 and 26)
4. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: "blue_door_1 is locked"" ✓ (Initially and in Step 13)
5. "If expression "blue_door_1 is locked" holds in some state s, then expression "At least one of the following conditions is true: "you are in room_4", "you are holding some object"" must hold at s or at some state after s" ✓ (In Step 13, we're holding grey_ball_3. Later on, we go to room_4 and hold yellow_ball_1.)
6. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: "you are holding red_box_1"" ✓ (Step 4)
7. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: "blue_door_1 is not locked"" ✓ (After Step 27)
8. "If expression "blue_door_1 is not locked" holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: "you are holding yellow_ball_1"" ✓ (Step 21 is before Step 27)

I think our plan is good to go! Let's just double check the final sequence of actions:

```
gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_1
gotoempty
gotoobject red_box_1 room_1
pick red_box_1 room_1
gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3
drop red_box_1 room_1
toggle red_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1
gotoobject grey_ball_3 room_3
pick grey_ball_3 room_3
gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1
gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1
gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2
gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3
gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1
gotodoor blue_door_2 room_3 room_4
drop grey_ball_3 room_3
toggle blue_door_2
gotoroom room_3 room_4 blue_door_2
gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_4
pick yellow_ball_1 room_4
gotodoor blue_door_2 room_4 room_3
gotoroom room_4 room_3 blue_door_2
gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1
gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1
gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2
toggle blue_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_2 blue_door_1
drop yellow_ball_1 room_2
gotoempty
gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_2
```

Actually, we need to sanity-check if some of the actions are valid. Going back to the explanation of the actions.

Let's re-verify if each action in our plan is valid:

14-15: After going to blue_door_1, we then go to red_door_1. This seems valid as both doors are in room_1.

I think everything else looks valid. The agent can go from one door to another within the same room, and it can pick up and drop objects as needed. The toggling of doors seems to match the constraints.

So our final plan is:

```
gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_1
gotoempty
gotoobject red_box_1 room_1
pick red_box_1 room_1
gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3
drop red_box_1 room_1
toggle red_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1
gotoobject grey_ball_3 room_3
pick grey_ball_3 room_3
gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1
gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1
gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2
gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3
gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1
gotodoor blue_door_2 room_3 room_4
drop grey_ball_3 room_3
toggle blue_door_2
gotoroom room_3 room_4 blue_door_2
gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_4
pick yellow_ball_1 room_4
gotodoor blue_door_2 room_4 room_3
gotoroom room_4 room_3 blue_door_2
gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1
gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1
gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2
toggle blue_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_2 blue_door_1
drop yellow_ball_1 room_2
gotoempty
gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_2
```

Let me make this cleaner (since we need to preserve the exact spacing and formatting):

```
gotoobject yellow_box_1 room_1
gotoempty
gotoobject red_box_1 room_1
pick red_box_1 room_1
gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3
drop red_box_1 room_1
toggle red_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1
gotoobject grey_ball_3 room_3
pick grey_ball_3 room_3
gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1
gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1
gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2
gotodoor red_door_1 room_1 room_3
gotoroom room_1 room_3 red_door_1
gotodoor blue_door_2 room_3 room_4
drop grey_ball_3 room_3
toggle blue_door_2
gotoroom room_3 room_4 blue_door_2
gotoobject yellow_ball_1 room_4
pick yellow_ball_1 room_4
gotodoor blue_door_2 room_4 room_3
gotoroom room_4 room_3 blue_door_2
gotodoor red_door_1 room_3 room_1
gotoroom room_3 room_1 red_door_1
gotodoor blue_door_1 room_1 room_2
toggle blue_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_2 blue_door_1
drop yellow_ball_1 room_2
gotoempty
gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_2
```
