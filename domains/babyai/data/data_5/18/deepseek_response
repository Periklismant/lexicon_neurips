The plan starts by unlocking the necessary doors to reach room_2 and satisfy the first constraint by being in front of purple_box_1 with green_door_1 unlocked. Returning to room_3, the agent picks up and drops the grey_ball_1 to fulfill the goal while satisfying all other constraints through holding objects and room visits.
