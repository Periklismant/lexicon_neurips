Okay, let me try to figure this out. So the goal is to end up in front of a blue door that connects room_4 and room_2, which is unlocked. The blue door connecting those rooms is blue_door_1. So I need to be in front of blue_door_1 in room_2 or room_4, but the constraints say I can never be in room_2. So I have to approach blue_door_1 from room_4. But how do I get to room_4 without going through room_2? Let's see the connections.

Original connections: room_1 is connected to room_2 via grey_door_1 and to room_3 via green_door_1. Room_2 connects to room_4 via blue_door_1, and room_3 connects to room_4 via yellow_door_1. All doors start locked. The constraints are that I can't be in room_2 at any time, and grey_door_1 must stay locked. Also, I need to unlock green_door_1 and blue_door_1 at some point, but with certain conditions.

Wait, the constraints require that "green_door_1 is not locked" must hold in at least one state, and "blue_door_1 is not locked" must also hold in at least one state. Also, whenever blue_door_1 is unlocked, there must have been a prior state where I was either in room_3 or in front of red_ball_1. Since red_ball_1 is in room_4, which is the final goal area, maybe I have to go to room_3 first, which would satisfy the condition for unlocking blue_door_1 later.

But how do I get to room_3 from room_1? The door is green_door_1, which is locked. So first, I need to unlock green_door_1. To unlock it, I need to toggle it, which requires being in front of it. But to get in front of it, I need to go to the door, which is in room_1. So in room_1, I can go to green_door_1 (since it's connecting room_1 and room_3), but the door is locked. Wait, but the preconditions for gotodoor are that you are in a room connected by the door and no object is blocking the position in front of the door. Are there any objects blocking? The initial state in room_1 has grey_ball_1, green_ball_1, blue_box_1, yellow_ball_1. Are any of these in front of the doors? The problem doesn't specify positions, just that objects are in the room. So assuming that the doors are not blocked by objects unless specified. So I can go to green_door_1 from room_1, then toggle it to unlock. That would satisfy the first constraint that green_door_1 is unlocked at some point.

Then, after unlocking green_door_1, I can go to room_3. Once in room_3, I can then go to yellow_door_1 (connecting room_3 and room_4). But yellow_door_1 is locked. So I need to go to yellow_door_1 in room_3, toggle it to unlock. Then go to room_4. Once in room_4, I can approach blue_door_1 (which connects to room_2). But blue_door_1 is locked. To unlock it, I need to toggle it. But to toggle, I need to be in front of it. However, blue_door_1 is in room_4 and room_2. But I can't go to room_2 because of the constraint. So I need to be in front of blue_door_1 from room_4. But how?

Wait, the initial state says blue_door_1 connects room_4 and room_2. So in room_4, blue_door_1 is present. So I can go to blue_door_1 in room_4. But to do that, I need to be in room_4. So steps: unlock green_door_1 in room_1, go to room_3, then unlock yellow_door_1 in room_3, go to room_4, then go to blue_door_1 in room_4, toggle it to unlock. But wait, the goal is for blue_door_1 to be unlocked and me in front of it. So that would satisfy the goal. However, there's another constraint: when blue_door_1 is unlocked, there must have been an earlier state where I was in room_3 or in front of red_ball_1. Since room_3 is visited before unlocking blue_door_1, that satisfies the condition.

Also, the plan needs to include me holding an object at some point. So maybe pick up an object, like red_ball_1 in room_4. But I can only pick up objects if I'm in the same room and not holding anything. So after arriving in room_4, I could go to red_ball_1, pick it up, then drop it somewhere else. But maybe it's simpler to pick up an object in room_1 first. Wait, but maybe I need to carry an object through doors. Let me think.

Alternatively, in room_4, after unlocking blue_door_1, the goal is achieved. But during the process, perhaps after arriving in room_4, I can pick up red_ball_1, which would satisfy the constraint of holding an object. Then, after dropping it, proceed. But the constraint is that in at least one state, I'm holding some object, so just picking it up once is enough.

Putting this together:

1. Start in room_1. Need to unlock green_door_1. So:

Action: gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3

But wait, the gotodoor action's precondition is that I'm in a room connected by the door and no object is blocking. Since I'm in room_1, which is connected via green_door_1, and assuming no blocking, so this is possible. Then toggle the door to unlock it.

So:

1. gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3
2. toggle green_door_1 → now it's unlocked.

Then go to room_3 using gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1.

3. gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1 → now in room_3.

Next, unlock yellow_door_1 (connecting room_3 and room_4). So:

4. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_4
5. toggle yellow_door_1 → unlocked.
6. gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_1 → now in room_4.

In room_4, need to unlock blue_door_1. But first, go to blue_door_1 in room_4.

7. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_4 room_2
8. toggle blue_door_1 → unlocks it.

This would satisfy the goal: blue_door_1 is blue, connects room_4 and room_2, I'm in front of it, and it's unlocked.

But also, need to check constraints:

- green_door_1 is unlocked in step 2 → satisfies the first constraint.
- Never in room_2: all steps are in 1,3,4 → okay.
- blue_door_1 is unlocked in step 8 → satisfies third constraint.
- Before step 8 (unlocking blue_door_1), the earlier state where I was in room_3 (steps 3-5) → satisfies the fourth constraint.
- grey_door_1 is always locked, since we never touch it → fifth constraint is okay.
- Need to hold an object at some point. But in current plan, steps 1-8 don't include picking up anything. So need to add that.

So perhaps after arriving in room_4, pick up red_ball_1.

After step 6 (in room_4):

7. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_4
8. pick red_ball_1 room_4 → now holding it. This satisfies the constraint of holding an object.

Then, proceed to unlock blue_door_1.

But need to drop the ball before moving? Because when moving rooms, you can't be holding an object? Wait, the gotoroom action doesn't mention carrying objects, so probably you can carry objects through doors. So after picking up red_ball_1, can I still proceed to the door?

Wait, after step 8 (pick red_ball_1), you need to drop it or keep holding. But to unlock blue_door_1, need to be in front of it. So after picking up the ball, go to the door, but you can't pick and carry while going to the door. Wait, after picking, you are no longer in front of the object, but carrying it.

So steps after arriving in room_4:

7. gotoempty (to drop the ball later, but maybe not needed)
8. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_4 → but need to be in same room. Yes, in room_4. Then pick it up.

Wait, after step 6, you are in room_4, not in front of anything. So:

7. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_4 → preconditions: in same room as red_ball_1, which is room_4. So possible.
8. pick red_ball_1 room_4 → now holding it. This satisfies the "holding some object" constraint.
9. drop red_ball_1 room_4 → but why? Maybe not necessary. But if we need to be in front of blue_door_1, we need to go there. So after picking up, we can go to blue_door_1.

Wait, after picking up, you are not in front of anything. So need to goto the door.

So:

9. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_4 room_2 → preconditions: in room_4, which is connected via blue_door_1, and no object is blocking. So possible.
10. toggle blue_door_1 → unlocks it. Now, the goal is achieved: in front of blue_door_1, which is blue, connects room_4 and room_2, and unlocked.

But in this case, step 8 is pick, which satisfies the constraint of holding something. Then step 9 and 10 proceed.

But let's check the order:

Original steps after arriving in room_4:

7. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_4
8. pick red_ball_1 room_4
9. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_4 room_2
10. toggle blue_door_1

This sequence works. Now, the constraint about blue_door_1 being unlocked (step 10) requires that in an earlier state, I was in room_3 or in front of red_ball_1. The earlier state where I was in room_3 is steps 3-5, which is before step 10, so that's satisfied. Also, step 7 and 8 are in front of red_ball_1, which is also earlier than step 10. So either condition is satisfied.

Additionally, the constraint that grey_door_1 is always locked is okay because we never touch it.

So the complete plan would be:

1. gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3
2. toggle green_door_1
3. gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1
4. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_4
5. toggle yellow_door_1
6. gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_1
7. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_4
8. pick red_ball_1 room_4
9. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_4 room_2
10. toggle blue_door_1

But wait, after step 8 (picking red_ball_1), when moving to step 9 (gotodoor), do we need to be in front of the door? The gotodoor action requires that you are in the same room as the door. Since we are in room_4, which is connected via blue_door_1, gotodoor is allowed. But after picking, the agent is no longer in front of anything. So moving to the door is possible.

But after picking, the agent is carrying the ball. When performing gotodoor, the preconditions don't mention holding objects, so that's okay. Then toggle the door, which requires being in front of it. Then, the final state is in front of blue_door_1, which is unlocked.

This plan satisfies all the constraints:

- green_door_1 is unlocked (step 2).
- Never in room_2.
- blue_door_1 is unlocked (step 10).
- Before unlocking blue_door_1 (step10), we were in room_3 (steps 3-5) and in front of red_ball_1 (steps7-8), either of which satisfies the condition.
- grey_door_1 remains locked.
- Held red_ball_1 in step8.

So this plan should be valid. Let me check the order again. Is there a shorter path?

Alternative approach: Maybe after unlocking green_door_1 and going to room_3, unlock yellow_door_1, go to room_4, then go to blue_door_1 and unlock. Then pick up the ball. But that would require holding the ball after unlocking, which is okay, but the constraint is that in at least one state, you're holding something. So either way works.

But the current plan has 10 steps. Can it be shorter?

Wait, when you arrive in room_4 (step6), you can immediately go to blue_door_1, unlock it. Then, to satisfy the holding constraint, maybe pick up red_ball_1 after unlocking. But then the holding happens after unlocking. But the constraint is that in at least one state, you are holding something. So even if you do that, it's okay. So steps:

1. gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3
2. toggle green_door_1
3. gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1
4. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_4
5. toggle yellow_door_1
6. gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_1
7. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_4 room_2
8. toggle blue_door_1
9. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_4
10. pick red_ball_1 room_4
11. drop red_ball_1 room_4 (maybe not necessary)

But this is longer. Alternatively, after step8, you could pick up the ball and then drop it. But the constraint just requires that at some point you are holding an object. So step10 would satisfy that, even if you drop it. But the original plan had step8 as pick, which is sufficient.

Wait, in the original plan, after step8, you are holding the ball. Then you proceed to steps9 and10. So you are holding the ball when toggling the door. The toggle action's preconditions don't care if you're holding something. So that's okay. Then, after unlocking, you are in front of the door, holding the ball. So the final state is you in front of blue_door_1, which is unlocked, and holding the ball. But the goal doesn't require not holding anything. So that's acceptable.

But the problem's goal is only about the door, not about the agent's inventory. So the plan would still work. However, the drop action isn't necessary for the goal. So perhaps the shorter plan is possible.

But in the first approach, steps1-10 are needed. Let's count:

Original plan steps:

1. gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3
2. toggle green_door_1
3. gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1
4. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_4
5. toggle yellow_door_1
6. gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_1
7. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_4
8. pick red_ball_1 room_4
9. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_4 room_2
10. toggle blue_door_1

That's 10 actions. But maybe there's a way to optimize.

Wait, after step6, you are in room_4. Instead of going to red_ball_1 first, perhaps go directly to blue_door_1 and toggle it. Then, after unlocking, pick up the ball. But then the holding is after unlocking, which is allowed. But the constraint for unlocking blue_door_1 requires that prior to unlocking, you were in room_3 or in front of red_ball_1. If you unlock blue_door_1 first, then pick up red_ball_1, then the unlocking step (step8) is after being in room_3 (step3-5), which is earlier. So that's okay.

So alternative steps:

1. gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3
2. toggle green_door_1
3. gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1
4. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_4
5. toggle yellow_door_1
6. gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_1
7. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_4 room_2
8. toggle blue_door_1 → unlocks it. Now in front of blue_door_1, which is unlocked. Goal achieved.
9. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_4
10. pick red_ball_1 room_4 → now holding, satisfies constraint.

But the goal is achieved at step8, but step9 and 10 are unnecessary. However, the constraint is that "you are holding some object" in at least one state. So if the plan stops at step8, the constraint isn't met. Therefore, we need to include steps to pick up an object.

So the original plan with steps1-10 is necessary. But in that case, after unlocking blue_door_1, you are holding the ball. So the final state is in front of blue_door_1 (goal met), and holding the ball (which is allowed). The goal doesn't say anything about not holding objects, so it's acceptable.

But maybe there's a way to pick up the ball before unlocking blue_door_1. Let's see:

After step6 (in room_4):

7. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_4
8. pick red_ball_1 room_4 → now holding.
9. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_4 room_2
10. toggle blue_door_1 → unlock.

This is the same as the original plan. So steps 1-10.

Alternatively, after unlocking blue_door_1, could drop the ball, but that's an extra step. The optimal plan is the shortest one. Since steps 1-10 achieve all goals and constraints, that's likely the minimal.

Another check: can any steps be combined or skipped?

For example, after toggling green_door_1 (step2), we go to room_3 (step3). Then, in room_3, we go to yellow_door_1 (step4), toggle (step5), go to room_4 (step6). Then, go to red_ball_1 (step7), pick (step8), go to blue_door_1 (step9), toggle (step10). Each step is necessary. No way to skip any of these.

Yes, each step is necessary. For example, you can't toggle a door without being in front of it. So to unlock each door, you must first go to it, then toggle. Then, to move between rooms, you must use the doors. And to satisfy the holding constraint, you must pick up an object. So this seems like the minimal steps.
