Let's analyze the problem and constraints carefully to find an optimal plan.

Initial state:
- You are in room_1
- All doors (grey_door_1, green_door_1, blue_door_1, yellow_door_1) are locked
- Various objects (balls and boxes) are distributed across rooms

Goal state:
- You are in front of a blue door connecting room_4 and room_2
- This door is not locked

The door that fits this description is blue_door_1, so our goal is to be in front of blue_door_1 in room_4, and the door should be unlocked.

Constraints:
1. At some point, green_door_1 must be unlocked
2. You must never be in room_2
3. At some point, blue_door_1 must be unlocked
4. Before unlocking blue_door_1, you must either be in front of red_ball_1 or be in room_3
5. grey_door_1 must always remain locked
6. At some point, you must hold some object

Let's think about how to satisfy these constraints while reaching the goal:

- You start in room_1
- You can't go to room_2 (constraint 2)
- You need to unlock green_door_1 (constraint 1) to go to room_3
- Before unlocking blue_door_1, you need to be in room_3 or in front of red_ball_1 (constraint 4)
- red_ball_1 is in room_4
- To get to room_4, you can go from room_3 via yellow_door_1, which requires unlocking it
- At some point, you need to pick up an object (constraint 6)

So a high-level plan would be:
1. In room_1, go to green_door_1 and unlock it
2. Go to room_3 from room_1 via green_door_1
3. Go to yellow_door_1 and unlock it
4. Go to room_4 from room_3 via yellow_door_1
5. In room_4, go to blue_door_1 and unlock it
6. At some point, pick up an object to satisfy constraint 6

Now let's implement this plan step by step:

Starting in room_1:
1. Go to green_door_1: "gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3"
2. Unlock green_door_1: "toggle green_door_1"
3. Go to room_3: "gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1"

Now in room_3:
4. Go to yellow_door_1: "gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_4"
5. Unlock yellow_door_1: "toggle yellow_door_1"
6. Go to room_4: "gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_1"

Now in room_4:
7. Go to blue_door_1: "gotodoor blue_door_1 room_4 room_2"
8. Unlock blue_door_1: "toggle blue_door_1"

But wait, we also need to pick up an object at some point to satisfy constraint 6. We could do this in room_1 before leaving, in room_3, or in room_4.

Let's pick up an object in room_1 before heading to room_3:
1. Go to an object in room_1 (e.g., grey_ball_1): "gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_1"
2. Pick up the object: "pick grey_ball_1 room_1"
3. Go to green_door_1: "gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3"
4. Unlock green_door_1: "toggle green_door_1"
5. Go to room_3: "gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1"
6. Drop the object (to free your hands): "gotoempty" then "drop grey_ball_1 room_3"

Then continue with the plan:
7. Go to yellow_door_1: "gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_4"
8. Unlock yellow_door_1: "toggle yellow_door_1"
9. Go to room_4: "gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_1"
10. Go to blue_door_1: "gotodoor blue_door_1 room_4 room_2"
11. Unlock blue_door_1: "toggle blue_door_1"

This should satisfy all the constraints and reach the goal state.

Let me review the plan one more time:

1. We pick up an object in room_1 (constraint 6)
2. We unlock green_door_1 (constraint 1)
3. We go to room_3, which satisfies the prerequisite for unlocking blue_door_1 (constraint 4)
4. We unlock blue_door_1 (constraint 3)
5. We never enter room_2 (constraint 2)
6. grey_door_1 remains locked (constraint 5)
7. We end up in front of blue_door_1 in room_4, and the door is unlocked (goal)

Let me formalize the complete plan:

1. "gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_1"
2. "pick grey_ball_1 room_1"
3. "gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3"
4. "toggle green_door_1"
5. "gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1"
6. "gotoempty"
7. "drop grey_ball_1 room_3"
8. "gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_4"
9. "toggle yellow_door_1"
10. "gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_1"
11. "gotodoor blue_door_1 room_4 room_2"
12. "toggle blue_door_1"

Now let's double-check if there are any missing actions or if we can optimize:

- We may not need to drop the object in room_3. We could keep holding it and still toggle the doors (as long as we're in front of them), which would save two actions.
- However, in that case, we'd need to be careful about the precondition of "toggle" - I need to check if you can toggle a door while holding an object.

Actually, let me re-read the preconditions and effects:

For "toggle":
- Precondition: you may only toggle a door d if you are in front of d.
- There's no restriction about whether you can be holding an object or not.

So we can optimize by keeping the object in hand and not dropping it:

1. "gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_1"
2. "pick grey_ball_1 room_1"
3. "gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3"
4. "toggle green_door_1"
5. "gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1"
6. "gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_4"
7. "toggle yellow_door_1"
8. "gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_1"
9. "gotodoor blue_door_1 room_4 room_2"
10. "toggle blue_door_1"

This plan should work and is optimal for the given constraints.

Hold on, let me make sure we didn't break anything else. The problem states that after performing "goto door", you are in front of the door. And the effect of "toggle" is that the door state (locked/unlocked) changes. After going through a door with "goto room", you're no longer in front of any object or door. So when we go to room_3, we need to navigate to yellow_door_1 before we can toggle it.

I think our plan is sound, but let me run through it step by step with the world state to make sure:

Initial state:
- You are in room_1
- All doors are locked
- You are not holding any object
- You are not in front of anything

Step 1: "gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_1"
- You are in room_1
- All doors are locked
- You are not holding any object
- You are in front of grey_ball_1

Step 2: "pick grey_ball_1 room_1"
- You are in room_1
- All doors are locked
- You are holding grey_ball_1
- You are not in front of anything

Step 3: "gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3"
- You are in room_1
- All doors are locked
- You are holding grey_ball_1
- You are in front of green_door_1

Step 4: "toggle green_door_1"
- You are in room_1
- green_door_1 is unlocked
- All other doors are locked
- You are holding grey_ball_1
- You are in front of green_door_1

Step 5: "gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1"
- You are in room_3
- green_door_1 is unlocked
- All other doors are locked
- You are holding grey_ball_1
- You are not in front of anything

Step 6: "gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_4"
- You are in room_3
- green_door_1 is unlocked
- All other doors are locked
- You are holding grey_ball_1
- You are in front of yellow_door_1

Step 7: "toggle yellow_door_1"
- You are in room_3
- green_door_1 and yellow_door_1 are unlocked
- grey_door_1 and blue_door_1 are locked
- You are holding grey_ball_1
- You are in front of yellow_door_1

Step 8: "gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_1"
- You are in room_4
- green_door_1 and yellow_door_1 are unlocked
- grey_door_1 and blue_door_1 are locked
- You are holding grey_ball_1
- You are not in front of anything

Step 9: "gotodoor blue_door_1 room_4 room_2"
- You are in room_4
- green_door_1 and yellow_door_1 are unlocked
- grey_door_1 and blue_door_1 are locked
- You are holding grey_ball_1
- You are in front of blue_door_1

Step 10: "toggle blue_door_1"
- You are in room_4
- green_door_1, yellow_door_1, and blue_door_1 are unlocked
- grey_door_1 is locked
- You are holding grey_ball_1
- You are in front of blue_door_1

Final state:
- You are in room_4
- You are in front of blue_door_1
- blue_door_1 is unlocked
- blue_door_1 connects room_4 and room_2

This matches our goal:
"There is a door d such that "The following conditions are all true: "d is blue", "room_4 and room_2 are connected via d", "you are in front of d", "d is not locked"""

And we've satisfied all the constraints:
1. At some point, green_door_1 was unlocked (in Step 4)
2. You never entered room_2
3. At some point, blue_door_1 was unlocked (in Step 10)
4. Before unlocking blue_door_1, you were in room_3 (in Steps 5-7)
5. grey_door_1 remained locked throughout
6. At some point, you held an object (grey_ball_1, from Step 2 onwards)

So our plan is:
1. "gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_1"
2. "pick grey_ball_1 room_1"
3. "gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3"
4. "toggle green_door_1"
5. "gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1"
6. "gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_4"
7. "toggle yellow_door_1"
8. "gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_1"
9. "gotodoor blue_door_1 room_4 room_2"
10. "toggle blue_door_1"

I think this plan is optimal given the constraints.
