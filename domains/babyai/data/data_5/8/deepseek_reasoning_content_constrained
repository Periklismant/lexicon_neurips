Okay, let's tackle this planning problem step by step. The goal is to get a blue box in front of me, and there are a bunch of constraints to consider. Let me start by understanding the initial state and the requirements.

First, the initial state: I'm in room_2. The blue_box_1 is in room_3. All doors are locked initially. The constraints say I can never be in room_1, and the green_door_1 and purple_door_1 must stay locked at all times. Also, at some point, the grey_door_1 must be unlocked, and I must hold an object at least once.

So, the blue box is in room_3. To get there from room_2, I need to go through doors. But the doors connecting room_2 to room_1 (purple_door_1) and room_1 to room_3 (green_door_1) are locked and must stay that way. So I can't go through those. The other doors are purple_door_2 (connects room_2 to room_4) and grey_door_1 (connects room_4 to room_3). Both are locked initially. But the constraint says that at least once, grey_door_1 must be unlocked. So maybe I need to unlock grey_door_1 to get from room_4 to room_3.

So the possible path is room_2 -> room_4 via purple_door_2, then room_4 -> room_3 via grey_door_1. But first, I need to unlock those doors. But purple_door_2 is purple and locked. Wait, in the initial state, purple_door_1 is locked, green_door_1 is locked, purple_door_2 is locked, and grey_door_1 is locked. So all doors are locked. So to move through any door, I need to toggle (unlock) it first. But toggling a door requires being in front of it, which might be blocked by objects. Wait, the preconditions for "gotodoor" say that there must be no object blocking the position in front of the door in the current room. So if there's a box or ball in front of the door, I can't go there to toggle it.

Looking at the objects in each room:

In room_2: grey_ball_1.

In room_3: green_box_1, blue_box_1, red_box_1, green_ball_1.

In room_4: grey_box_1, red_ball_1, grey_ball_2.

So, for example, in room_2, the door to room_4 is purple_door_2. Are there any objects blocking it? The initial state doesn't mention any objects blocking doors, but the problem says that the "goto door" action requires that there's no object blocking the position in front of d in the current room. But unless the problem states that objects are blocking doors, maybe we can assume that they aren't. Wait, the "pick" action's effect (v) says that if x was blocking some door, then it's no longer blocking. So perhaps objects can block doors. But the initial state doesn't mention any objects blocking doors. So maybe in the initial state, none of the doors are blocked. So I can go to the doors.

So starting in room_2. To get to room_4 via purple_door_2, which is locked. So first, I need to go to purple_door_2 in room_2, toggle it to unlock, then go through it to room_4. Then in room_4, go to grey_door_1 (which connects to room_3), toggle it to unlock (which satisfies the constraint that grey_door_1 is unlocked at some state), then go to room_3. Then, go to the blue_box_1 and be in front of it. But since the goal is to have a blue box in front of me, which is in room_3. But I need to check if the blue box is already in room_3. It is. So maybe I can just go to room_3, then go to the blue box. But how?

But the doors from room_2 to room_1 and room_3 are locked and must remain locked. So I can't use the green_door_1 (room_1 to room_3) because it's locked and must stay locked. So the only path is room_2 -> room_4 via purple_door_2, then room_4 -> room_3 via grey_door_1. But both doors are initially locked, so I need to unlock them.

Wait, but the constraint says that the green_door_1 and purple_door_1 must remain locked in every state. But I don't need to touch those. The purple_door_2 is between room_2 and room_4. So first, I need to unlock purple_door_2. But to do that, I need to be in front of it. So from room_2, I can gotoempty (since the preconditions for gotoempty are always allowed), then gotodoor purple_door_2 in room_2. Wait, but "gotodoor d r1 r2" requires that I'm in a room connected by d. So in room_2, purple_door_2 connects room_2 and room_4. So yes, I can go to purple_door_2 from room_2. Then toggle it to unlock. Then use gotoroom to go to room_4. Then in room_4, go to grey_door_1 (connects to room_3), toggle it (unlocking it, which satisfies the constraint), then go to room_3. Then in room_3, gotoobject blue_box_1, which is there. But wait, the goal is "there is a box v such that v is blue and you are in front of v". So once I'm in front of blue_box_1 in room_3, that's the goal.

But wait, the problem says the initial state has blue_box_1 in room_3, so maybe I don't need to move it. So the plan would be to get to room_3 and be in front of blue_box_1. But how?

So steps:

1. From room_2, go to purple_door_2 (which is locked). But to do that, first, I need to gotodoor purple_door_2 room_2 room_4. Precondition: I'm in a room connected by the door (yes, room_2 is connected to room_4 via purple_door_2). Also, no object is blocking the position. Since the initial state doesn't mention any objects blocking doors, so possible.

So action: gotodoor purple_door_2 room_2 room_4.

Then toggle purple_door_2. Now it's unlocked.

Then gotoroom room_2 room_4 purple_door_2. Now I'm in room_4.

Now in room_4, need to get to grey_door_1, which connects to room_3. So gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3. Then toggle it (unlock). Then gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1. Now in room_3. Then gotoobject blue_box_1 room_3. That's the goal.

But wait, the constraints require that at some point, I'm holding an object. So I need to pick up something and then drop it. Because the plan must include a state where I'm holding an object. So maybe after unlocking grey_door_1, before going to room_3, I can pick up an object in room_4. For example, pick up grey_box_1 in room_4. Then drop it somewhere. But this adds steps. But how to integrate that.

Alternatively, maybe during the path, after going to room_4, I can pick up an object, then proceed. Let me see.

So revised steps:

1. In room_2, go to purple_door_2, toggle to unlock.

2. Go to room_4.

3. In room_4, go to grey_door_1, toggle to unlock (this satisfies the grey_door_1 must be unlocked at some state).

4. Then, before leaving room_4, pick up an object. For example, the grey_box_1. But to pick it up, I need to be in front of it. So in room_4, first gotoempty, then gotoobject grey_box_1. Then pick it up. Then drop it. But that's more steps.

Alternatively, after toggling grey_door_1, go to room_3, then in room_3, pick up an object. But the constraint requires that at least once I'm holding an object. So maybe when in room_3, after reaching the blue box, pick it up and drop it. But the goal is to be in front of a blue box, which could be the same one. But if I pick it up and drop it again, that might work.

Wait, the goal is "there is a box v such that v is blue and you are in front of v". So if I pick up the blue box and drop it, then I'm in front of it again. Let me think.

Wait, after dropping, the effect is that I'm in front of x (the object dropped). So if I pick up blue_box_1, then drop it in room_3, then I'll be in front of it, which satisfies the goal. But that adds steps. But maybe that's necessary to satisfy the "holding some object" constraint.

So let's outline:

1. From room_2: gotoempty (to get in front of empty position, so that when moving to door, I can leave that position).

Wait, maybe not necessary. Let's see:

Starting in room_2. Current position: in front of nothing. Because the initial state doesn't mention being in front of any object. So first action could be gotodoor purple_door_2 room_2 room_4. That would make me in front of the door. Then toggle it (unlock). Then gotoroom room_2 room_4 purple_door_2. Now in room_4. Then gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3. Toggle it (unlock). Then gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1. Now in room_3. Then gotoobject blue_box_1 room_3. Now in front of it. But the constraint is that I must have held some object at some point. So this plan doesn't include that. So I need to add steps where I pick up and drop an object.

So perhaps after getting to room_3, goto the blue box, pick it up (but that requires being in front of it, which I am after gotoobject. Then pick it up. Now holding it. Then drop it. Then I'm in front of it again. So that would satisfy the goal and the constraint of holding an object.

So steps:

1. gotodoor purple_door_2 room_2 room_4

2. toggle purple_door_2 (now unlocked)

3. gotoroom room_2 room_4 purple_door_2

4. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3

5. toggle grey_door_1 (now unlocked)

6. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1

7. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_3

8. pick blue_box_1 room_3 (now holding it, which satisfies the constraint)

9. drop blue_box_1 room_3 (now in front of it again)

But step 9: drop requires that the position in front is empty. When I pick up the blue box, it's no longer in the room. Then dropping it puts it back. But after picking it up, I'm no longer in front of it. So after picking, I need to drop it. But where? The drop action requires that I'm in front of an empty position. Wait, no. The drop action's precondition is (i) currently holding x, and (ii) the position in front of you is empty. So after picking up the blue box, I'm not in front of anything. So to drop it, I need to be in front of an empty position. So maybe after picking, I need to gotoempty, then drop.

Wait, the effects of "pick x r" are (i) you are no longer in front of x, (ii) hands not empty, (iii) carrying x, (iv) x not in the room. So after picking, I'm not in front of anything. So to drop, I need to go to an empty position. So steps:

7. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_3

8. pick blue_box_1 room_3

9. gotoempty (in room_3)

10. drop blue_box_1 room_3

Now, after dropping, I'm in front of blue_box_1, which satisfies the goal. And step 8 satisfies the constraint of holding an object. Also, step 5 unlocks grey_door_1, satisfying that constraint.

But let's check if all constraints are met:

- Never in room_1: Correct, since all movements are room_2 -> room_4 -> room_3.

- green_door_1 and purple_door_1 remain locked: Yes, we didn't touch them.

- grey_door_1 is unlocked at least once: Yes, step 5 unlocks it.

- holding some object at least once: step 8.

So this plan should work. Now, let's check the order.

But wait, when moving from room_4 to room_3 via grey_door_1, which is now unlocked. Then in room_3, we need to goto blue_box_1.

But another thing: in the initial state, the blue_box_1 is in room_3. So after picking it up, it's no longer in the room, but after dropping it, it's back. So the final state has blue_box_1 in room_3 again, and I'm in front of it.

But is there a shorter plan? For example, can I avoid picking and dropping? If I can hold an object elsewhere. For example, in room_4, pick up grey_box_1, carry it to room_3, then drop it. But that would also satisfy the "holding some object" constraint. Let's see.

Alternative plan:

1. gotodoor purple_door_2 room_2 room_4

2. toggle purple_door_2

3. gotoroom room_2 room_4 purple_door_2

4. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_4

5. pick grey_box_1 room_4

6. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3

7. toggle grey_door_1

8. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1

9. drop grey_box_1 room_3

10. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_3

This way, step 5 satisfies holding an object. Then drop it in room_3. Then go to blue_box_1. But this adds more steps. The previous plan was 10 steps, this is 10 steps. But maybe the first plan is shorter (steps 1-10 vs 1-10). Wait, both have similar steps, but maybe the first one is better.

Alternatively, after entering room_4, before going to grey_door_1, pick up an object. Let's see:

1. gotodoor purple_door_2 room_2 room_4

2. toggle purple_door_2

3. gotoroom room_2 room_4 purple_door_2

4. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_4 (assuming red_ball_1 is in room_4)

5. pick red_ball_1 room_4 (now holding it)

6. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3

7. toggle grey_door_1

8. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1

9. drop red_ball_1 room_3

10. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_3

But this also works. The problem is that the ball is not a box, but the goal requires a box. But the goal is satisfied as long as there's a blue box in front of me. So in this case, dropping the ball doesn't affect that. So after step 10, I'm in front of the blue box, which is still in room_3. But wait, after step 9, the red_ball_1 is dropped in room_3. Then step 10, gotoobject blue_box_1 (which is still there, since I didn't touch it). So this plan also works, and perhaps uses fewer steps? No, same number. But maybe this approach is better.

But in the initial plan, when I pick up the blue box, then drop it, I have to do two more steps (gotoempty and drop). So that's steps 7-10 in the first plan. The alternative plan where I pick up an object in room_4 may be better because it's 10 steps instead of 10. Wait, same length. Hmm.

But perhaps there's a way to combine steps. For example, after unlocking grey_door_1, go to room_3, pick the blue box, drop it, and be in front of it. But that requires picking and dropping, which is three steps. Alternatively, in room_4, pick up an object, carry it through grey_door_1, drop it, then go to blue box. That's four steps (pick, toggle, gotoroom, drop, gotoobject). So same as before.

But the first plan requires picking the blue box, which is necessary anyway. Wait, no. The goal is to be in front of a blue box, not necessarily to hold it. So the initial plan where I just go to the blue box without picking it up would work, except that I need to hold an object at some point. So in that case, the first plan's steps 1-7 would get me to the blue box, but I haven't held any object. So I need to add steps to pick and drop.

Alternatively, maybe during the journey, pick up an object. For example, in room_4, pick up the grey_box_1 before going to room_3. Let's see:

1. From room_2, unlock purple_door_2, go to room_4.

2. In room_4, go to grey_box_1, pick it up (now holding an object).

3. Go to grey_door_1, unlock it.

4. Go to room_3, drop the grey_box_1 (now satisfy the holding constraint).

5. Go to blue_box_1.

This would be steps:

1. gotodoor purple_door_2 room_2 room_4

2. toggle purple_door_2

3. gotoroom room_2 room_4 purple_door_2

4. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_4

5. pick grey_box_1 room_4

6. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3

7. toggle grey_door_1

8. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1

9. drop grey_box_1 room_3

10. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_3

This plan has 10 steps. The previous one where I pick the blue box had 10 steps as well. So same length. But maybe this is better because it's using a different object. But both are valid. But the problem says to provide an optimal plan with the least steps. So perhaps there's a shorter way.

Wait, in the first approach:

Steps:

1. gotodoor purple_door_2 r2 r4

2. toggle purple_door_2

3. gotoroom r2 r4 purple_door_2

4. gotodoor grey_door_1 r4 r3

5. toggle grey_door_1

6. gotoroom r4 r3 grey_door_1

7. gotoobject blue_box_1 r3

8. pick blue_box_1 r3

9. gotoempty

10. drop blue_box_1 r3

This is 10 steps. But perhaps steps can be reduced. Let's see.

After step 6, I'm in room_3. Then step 7: gotoobject blue_box_1. Then pick, then gotoempty, then drop. But maybe after dropping, I'm in front of the blue box, so that's the goal.

Alternatively, after picking up the blue box and dropping it, I'm in front of it again. So steps 7-10 are necessary. So that's 10 steps.

Alternatively, in room_3, after arriving, can I just gotoempty and drop there? But I need to be in front of the blue box. So the goal is to be in front of a blue box, which is already present. So if I can get to it without moving it, that would be better.

Wait, if the blue box is already in room_3, and I can just go to it, then steps 1-7 would suffice. But step 7 is gotoobject blue_box_1. Then I'm in front of it. But then I haven't held any object. So that's a problem. So the constraint requires that at least once I'm holding an object. So I need to have at least one pick action.

So even if I reach the blue box, I have to pick it up and drop it to satisfy the constraint, which adds steps. But maybe there's a way to hold another object on the way.

For example, in room_4, pick up grey_box_1, then drop it in room_4, then proceed. But that would add steps. Alternatively, pick up an object in room_4, carry it to room_3, and drop it there. Then go to the blue box.

But the minimal steps would be to pick and drop an object along the way. So in room_4, pick up grey_box_1, carry it to room_3, drop it, then go to blue_box_1. This way, the holding constraint is satisfied when carrying grey_box_1.

So steps:

1. gotodoor purple_door_2 room_2 room_4

2. toggle purple_door_2

3. gotoroom room_2 room_4 purple_door_2

4. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_4

5. pick grey_box_1 room_4

6. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3

7. toggle grey_door_1

8. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1

9. drop grey_box_1 room_3

10. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_3

This is 10 steps, same as before. So both approaches are the same length. So either plan is acceptable. But maybe there's a shorter path.

Wait, after entering room_4, can I pick up an object without going to it? Because to pick, I need to be in front of it. So I need to gotoobject first.

Alternatively, after step 3 (in room_4), I can gotoempty, then pick up an object? No, because to pick, I need to be in front of the object. So I must gotoobject first.

Hmm. So it seems that the minimal plan is 10 steps. But perhaps there's a way to combine some actions. Let's think.

Wait, when I'm in room_4 after step 3, I can directly goto grey_box_1 (step 4), pick it up (step5), then goto grey_door_1 (step6), toggle (step7), then go to room_3 (step8), drop (step9), goto blue box (step10). So that's 10 steps.

Alternatively, after step 3, goto grey_door_1 (step4), toggle (step5), go to room_3 (step6), then goto blue box (step7), pick (step8), drop (step9). But then, the holding constraint is met, and the grey_door_1 is unlocked (step5). But in this case, after step6 (in room_3), I need to pick the blue box. So steps:

1. gotodoor purple_door_2 r2 r4

2. toggle

3. gotoroom r2 r4

4. gotodoor grey_door_1 r4 r3

5. toggle

6. gotoroom r4 r3

7. gotoobject blue_box_1 r3

8. pick

9. gotoempty

10. drop

This is 10 steps again. So same length. So no improvement.

Therefore, any valid plan will have at least 10 steps. But wait, maybe some steps can be skipped. For example, after unlocking purple_door_2, when moving to room_4, do I need to first gotoempty before going to grey_door_1? Or can I go directly from room_4's entry point to the grey_door_1?

Wait, when you use gotoroom, you are no longer in front of anything. So after entering room_4, I'm not in front of any object or door. So to go to grey_door_1, I need to use gotodoor. So steps:

After step 3 (in room_4):

4. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3

5. toggle grey_door_1

6. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1

But then I need to pick an object. So after step6, I'm in room_3. Then gotoobject blue_box_1, pick, drop. But this doesn't include holding an object. So I need to add steps to pick an object. So perhaps in room_3, I can pick the blue box, then drop it. Which adds steps 7-10.

Alternatively, in room_4, after step3, gotoobject red_ball_1, pick it up, then proceed. So steps:

4. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_4

5. pick red_ball_1 room_4

6. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room3

7. toggle

8. gotoroom to room3

9. drop red_ball_1

10. gotoobject blue_box_1

So again, 10 steps.

It seems that no matter the approach, the plan requires at least 10 steps. But perhaps there's a shorter way.

Wait, what if I can pick up an object in room_2 before moving? The initial state has grey_ball_1 in room_2. So in room_2, I can gotoobject grey_ball_1, pick it up, then proceed. But then I have to carry it through. Let's see:

1. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_2

2. pick grey_ball_1 room_2

3. gotodoor purple_door_2 room_2 room4

4. toggle purple_door_2

5. gotoroom room2 room4 purple_door_2

6. gotodoor grey_door_1 room4 room3

7. toggle grey_door_1

8. gotoroom room4 room3 grey_door_1

9. drop grey_ball_1 room3

10. gotoobject blue_box_1 room3

This way, steps 1-10. But this also is 10 steps. But now, the holding constraint is satisfied early. But same length. So no improvement.

Alternatively, after picking grey_ball_1, can I drop it in room4, then proceed. But that would add steps. So not helpful.

So all possible valid plans seem to require 10 steps. Therefore, any of these 10-step plans are optimal. But the problem requires the shortest possible.

But wait, maybe there's a way to avoid some steps. For example, after unlocking grey_door_1, can I drop the object in room3 and then goto blue_box_1 without needing to gotoempty?

Wait, the drop action requires that the position in front of me is empty. So when I'm in room3 after entering via grey_door_1, I'm not in front of anything. So to drop, I can just do drop grey_ball_1 room3, which puts it in front of me. Then I can gotoobject blue_box_1.

Wait, no. The effect of drop is that I'm in front of x. So if I'm not in front of anything when I drop, then after dropping, I'm in front of the object. So maybe after step8 (gotoroom to room3), I'm not in front of anything. So step9: drop grey_ball_1 room3 (assuming I'm holding it). Then step10: now I'm in front of grey_ball_1. Then step10: gotoobject blue_box_1. But blue_box_1 is in room3. So that's possible. But this requires that I'm carrying the object from room4 to room3.

So in this case:

Steps:

1. gotoobject grey_ball_1 room2

2. pick

3. gotodoor purple_door_2 room2 room4

4. toggle

5. gotoroom room2 room4 purple_door_2

6. gotodoor grey_door_1 room4 room3

7. toggle

8. gotoroom room4 room3 grey_door_1

9. drop grey_ball_1 room3

10. gotoobject blue_box_1 room3

This is 10 steps. So same length.

Therefore, all possible plans seem to require 10 steps. Hence, the optimal plan is 10 steps long. Now, I need to write this plan in the required format.

But let's make sure all preconditions are met in each step.

Let's verify each step of one of the plans:

Plan example (using grey_box_1):

1. gotodoor purple_door_2 room_2 room_4

Pre: in room_2 (yes), door connects room_2 and room_4 (yes), no object blocking (assumed yes). Valid.

2. toggle purple_door_2

Pre: in front of purple_door_2. Yes, after step1. Now door is unlocked.

3. gotoroom room_2 room_4 purple_door_2

Pre: in room_2, adjacent to room_4 via purple_door_2 (yes), door is unlocked (after step2). Valid.

4. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_4

Pre: in room_4 (yes), grey_box_1 is in room_4 (yes). Valid.

5. pick grey_box_1 room_4

Pre: in room_4 (yes), not holding anything (yes, after step3, which causes you to not be holding anything). Valid.

6. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3

Pre: in room_4 (yes), door connects room_4 and room_3 (yes). Valid.

7. toggle grey_door_1

Pre: in front of grey_door_1 (yes, after step6). Valid.

8. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1

Pre: in room_4 (yes), door is unlocked (after step7). Valid.

9. drop grey_box_1 room_3

Pre: holding grey_box_1 (yes), position in front is empty (yes, after entering room_3 via gotoroom, which leaves you not in front of anything; so when dropping, you can drop in the current position, which is empty). Valid.

10. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_3

Pre: in room_3 (yes), blue_box_1 is in room_3 (yes, was initially there and wasn't picked up). Valid.

After step10, the goal is met: there's a blue box (blue_box_1) in room_3, and I'm in front of it.

All constraints are met:

- Never in room_1: Correct.

- green_door_1 and purple_door_1 remain locked: Yes.

- grey_door_1 was unlocked in step7: Yes.

- Holding some object (step5): Yes.

This plan is valid and has 10 steps, which seems to be the minimum.
