Okay, let's see. The goal is to have a blue box in front of me. The initial state has the blue_box_1 in room_3. But I'm starting in room_2. So I need to get to room_3 where the blue box is. But all the doors are locked initially. Hmm.

First, I need to unlock the doors. Let's check the connections. The doors between room_2 and room_1 are purple_door_1, which is locked. Between room_2 and room_4 is purple_door_2, also locked. To get to room_3 from room_1, there's green_door_1. So maybe the path is room_2 -> room_1 via purple_door_1, then room_1 -> room_3 via green_door_1. But both doors are locked.

Wait, but how do I unlock them? To toggle a door, I need to be in front of it. But to get in front of a door, I need to be in a room connected by that door. So in room_2, the doors available are purple_door_1 (connecting to room_1) and purple_door_2 (connecting to room_4). But both are locked. But to unlock them, I need to be in front of them. But if the door is locked, can I go to it? The preconditions for "gotodoor" say that the door must connect the current room, and there's no object blocking the position in front of the door. Are there any objects blocking doors in room_2?

Looking at the initial state, in room_2, there's grey_ball_1. If that's not in front of a door, then maybe I can go to the door. Let's see. So in room_2, the doors are purple_door_1 (to room_1) and purple_door_2 (to room_4). So first, I can try to go to one of these doors. Let's pick purple_door_1 first. But the door is locked. Wait, but the "goto door" action's precondition is that the door connects the current room and there's no object blocking the position. So as long as there's no object in front of the door in the current room, I can go there. Since grey_ball_1 is in room_2, but not necessarily blocking the door. So if I can go to the door, then I can toggle it to unlock.

So steps:

1. In room_2, go to purple_door_1 (since I'm in room_2, which is connected via purple_door_1 to room_1). So "gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1". Then toggle it. That would unlock it. Then I can go through to room_1.

But wait, after toggling, the door becomes unlocked. Then "gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1" would be possible. Then from room_1, I can go to the green_door_1 to room_3. But green_door_1 is locked. So I need to unlock that as well.

So after reaching room_1, I need to go to green_door_1 (connecting room_1 and room_3). Then toggle it to unlock. Then go to room_3. Once in room_3, the blue_box_1 is there. Then I need to go to the blue_box_1 and be in front of it.

But wait, the goal is just to be in front of a blue box. The blue_box_1 is already in room_3. So once I'm in room_3, I can go to it. Let's outline the steps:

1. In room_2, go to purple_door_1 (gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1)
2. Toggle purple_door_1 (unlock)
3. Go from room_2 to room_1 via purple_door_1 (gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1)
4. Now in room_1, go to green_door_1 (gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3)
5. Toggle green_door_1 to unlock
6. Go to room_3 from room_1 via green_door_1 (gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1)
7. Now in room_3, go to blue_box_1 (gotoobject blue_box_1 room_3)
8. Then done.

But wait, are there any objects blocking the doors? Let's check. In room_2, the grey_ball_1 is present, but it's not mentioned to be blocking any door. The initial state doesn't mention any objects blocking doors. The preconditions for "gotodoor" require that there's no object blocking the position in front of the door in the current room. Since the problem statement doesn't mention any objects blocking doors, I assume that the doors are not blocked. So the steps above should work.

But let's verify each action's preconditions.

First, starting in room_2.

Action 1: gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1. Preconditions: in room_2 (which is true), and the door connects room_2 and room_1 (yes), and no object blocking the position. Since no objects are blocking, this is okay. Then perform the action. Now in front of purple_door_1.

Action 2: toggle purple_door_1. Precondition: must be in front of the door. Yes. So toggle, which unlocks it.

Action 3: gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1. Preconditions: current room is room_2, adjacent to room_1 (yes), and door is unlocked (now it is). So can go. Now in room_1.

Action 4: gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3. Preconditions: in room_1, which is now true. Door connects room_1 to room_3. Check if any object is blocking. Since room_1's initial state doesn't have any objects mentioned (the boxes and balls are in room_3 and room_4 and room_2). So no blocking. So can go to green_door_1.

Action 5: toggle green_door_1. Now it's unlocked.

Action 6: gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1. Now door is unlocked. So move to room_3.

Action 7: gotoobject blue_box_1 room_3. Preconditions: in room_3 (yes), and the object is there. Blue_box_1 is in room_3. So this action is possible.

So the plan would be:

```
gotoempty
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1
toggle purple_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1
gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3
toggle green_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1
gotoobject blue_box_1 room_3
```

Wait, but wait, the initial position after starting in room_2: when you start, you are in room_2 but not in front of any object or door. So the first action might need to be gotoempty to position yourself, but maybe it's not necessary. Because the first action could be gotodoor directly. Let me check the initial state.

In the initial state, the agent is in room_2. The initial 'you have visited room_2'. But the agent's position in the room is not specified as being in front of anything. Wait, but the actions require that you are in front of something to pick or toggle. So maybe the agent starts in front of nothing. So the first action could be to go to the door. But according to the action definitions, "goto object" requires you to be in the same room as x. So to go to the door, which is in room_2, connecting to room_1. So gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1. So the first action can be that. But the preconditions for gotodoor are that you are in a room connected via the door (yes) and no object is blocking the door's position. Since there's no mention of objects blocking, that's okay.

Wait, but maybe the grey_ball_1 in room_2 is blocking the door? Because if the ball is in front of the door, then the gotodoor action can't be performed. But the initial state doesn't say that. The problem statement's initial state only says "grey_ball_1 is in room_2", but doesn't specify its position relative to doors. Unless there's a default assumption that objects are not blocking doors unless stated. The problem says that the 'toggle' action's effect includes that if the object was blocking a door, then it's no longer blocking. But in the initial state, there's no mention of any object blocking a door. So I think it's safe to assume that the doors are not blocked by any objects. Therefore, the agent can go to the door directly.

So the first action can be 'gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1' without needing to move to empty first. But wait, when you start, are you in front of any object or door? The initial state says "you are in room_2" and "you are not holding any object", but doesn't specify if you are in front of anything. The effects of "goto" actions include that you are in front of something. So if the agent's initial state is not in front of any object or door, then the first action can be to go to the door. Therefore, the initial steps would be:

1. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1
2. toggle purple_door_1 (unlocks it)
3. gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1
4. gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3
5. toggle green_door_1
6. gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1
7. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_3

That's seven actions. Is there a shorter path?

Alternative path: room_2 to room_4 via purple_door_2, then room_4 to room_3 via grey_door_1. Let's see. The doors purple_door_2 (room_2 to room_4) is locked. So need to unlock it. But in room_4, the grey_door_1 is also locked. So steps would be:

1. In room_2, go to purple_door_2 (connecting room_2 and room_4)
2. Toggle to unlock
3. Go to room_4
4. In room_4, go to grey_door_1 (connects to room_3)
5. Toggle to unlock
6. Go to room_3
7. Then goto blue_box_1.

But that's the same number of steps. So which path is shorter? Both require unlocking two doors. So same steps. Maybe the first path is better.

Wait, but in the first path, after unlocking purple_door_1 and green_door_1, you can reach room_3. But the second path unlocks purple_door_2 and grey_door_1. Either way, two doors to unlock.

But let's count steps for each path.

First path:

1. gotodoor purple_door_1 room2 room1
2. toggle
3. gotoroom r2 r1
4. gotodoor green_door_1 room1 room3
5. toggle
6. gotoroom r1 r3
7. gotoobject blue_box_1 room3

Total 7 steps.

Second path:

1. gotodoor purple_door_2 room2 room4
2. toggle
3. gotoroom r2 r4
4. gotodoor grey_door_1 room4 room3
5. toggle
6. gotoroom r4 r3
7. gotoobject blue_box_1 room3

Also 7 steps. So same length. Either way.

But maybe there's a shorter path. Let me think. The blue box is in room3, which is connected to room1 via green_door_1 and to room4 via grey_door_1. So if we can get to room3 through room4, but in the initial state, room4's grey_door_1 is locked. So same as before.

Is there a way to have fewer steps? For example, after unlocking a door, can you take a different route? Not sure. The problem is that all doors are locked initially. So you have to unlock two doors to get from room2 to room3.

Alternatively, maybe there's an object that can be picked up to unlock a door, but the problem doesn't mention keys. The toggle action just requires being in front of the door. So no keys, just toggling the door's state.

So the minimal steps would be seven actions. Let me check again.

Another possibility: after unlocking purple_door_1, go to room1, then unlock green_door_1, then go to room3. Then goto the blue box. That's seven steps. So yes.

Alternatively, maybe after step 3 (gotoroom room2 room1), can we directly go to the door and unlock it, then proceed. Which is what the plan does.

I think that's the optimal plan. Let me check if there's a way to save steps. For example, can the agent do anything else while moving? But each action is a separate step.

Another thing: when the agent is in front of a door, after toggling, can they immediately go through? For example, after step 2 (toggle purple_door_1), the agent is still in front of the door. Then step 3 is gotoroom, which requires being in room2. Yes, because step 1 moves to the door in room2. So after toggling, they are still in room2, in front of the door. So gotoroom is possible.

Wait, the "gotoroom" action's effect is that you leave the current room (r1) and enter r2. So after step 3 (gotoroom room2 room1 purple_door_1), the agent is in room1. Then step 4 is gotodoor green_door_1 room1 room3. So yes.

So the plan looks valid. Now, check constraints. The problem mentions constraints but the user didn't list any. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:

"A valid plan for the abovementioned problem must abide by the following constraints:"

But then there's no constraints listed. Maybe that's a formatting error. But assuming there are no additional constraints beyond the preconditions of the actions, then the plan is okay.

Therefore, the optimal plan has 7 steps.
