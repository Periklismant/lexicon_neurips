Alright, I need to come up with a plan to solve this gridworld problem. Let me analyze the problem step by step.

**Goal**: Find a blue box (there is only one, blue_box_1) and be in front of it.

**Current state**:
- I am in room_2
- blue_box_1 is in room_3
- various objects are in various rooms
- all doors are locked
- I'm not holding any object

**Constraints**:
1. I can't enter room_1
2. green_door_1 must remain locked
3. purple_door_1 must remain locked
4. grey_door_1 must be unlocked at some point
5. I must hold some object at some point

Let me think about how to reach blue_box_1 in room_3.

From room_2, I can't directly go to room_3. I need to either:
1. Go through room_1 (which is disallowed by the constraints)
2. Go through room_4 to get to room_3 (which seems like the only viable path)

To go from room_2 to room_4, I need to unlock purple_door_2.
To go from room_4 to room_3, I need to unlock grey_door_1 (which is allowed and actually required by constraint 4).

I'll need to pick up some object at some point due to constraint 5. I could pick up grey_ball_1 which is in room_2, then drop it later.

So, here's a plan:
1. Go to grey_ball_1 in room_2
2. Pick up grey_ball_1 (to satisfy constraint 5)
3. Go to purple_door_2
4. Toggle purple_door_2 to unlock it
5. Go to room_4 via purple_door_2
6. Go to grey_door_1
7. Toggle grey_door_1 to unlock it (to satisfy constraint 4)
8. Go to room_3 via grey_door_1
9. Drop grey_ball_1 (not necessary for the goal, but I need to drop it to free my hands)
10. Go to blue_box_1

Let me check this plan against the constraints:
1. I never enter room_1 ✓
2. green_door_1 remains locked ✓
3. purple_door_1 remains locked ✓
4. grey_door_1 is unlocked at some point ✓
5. I hold grey_ball_1 at some point ✓

Let me formalize this plan in the required format:

1. "gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_2": Go in front of grey_ball_1 in room_2.
2. "pick grey_ball_1 room_2": Pick up grey_ball_1 in room_2.
3. "gotodoor purple_door_2 room_2 room_4": Go in front of purple_door_2, connecting room_2 to room_4.
4. "toggle purple_door_2": Unlock purple_door_2.
5. "gotoroom room_2 room_4 purple_door_2": Go to room_4 from room_2 using purple_door_2.
6. "gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3": Go in front of grey_door_1, connecting room_4 to room_3.
7. "toggle grey_door_1": Unlock grey_door_1.
8. "gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1": Go to room_3 from room_4 using grey_door_1.
9. "gotoempty": Go in front of an empty position in room_3.
10. "drop grey_ball_1 room_3": Drop grey_ball_1 in room_3.
11. "gotoobject blue_box_1 room_3": Go in front of blue_box_1 in room_3.

Actually, let me double-check this plan against the problem description.

The problem says that the "drop" action only works if "the position in front of you is empty." So, I need to ensure that I'm in front of an empty position before dropping grey_ball_1 in room_3.

Let me ensure that step 9 (gotoempty) is valid. After step 8, I've just entered room_3, and I'm no longer in front of any object or door (according to the effects of "gotoroom"). So, I should be able to use "gotoempty" to go in front of an empty position in room_3.

Alright, the plan seems valid. Let me double-check one more thing:

When I toggle purple_door_2, it becomes unlocked. Then, I go through it to room_4. I then toggle grey_door_1 to unlock it and go through it to room_3. This all seems consistent with the problem description.

After reaching room_3, I need to drop grey_ball_1 because I need my hands to be empty to complete the goal (being in front of blue_box_1).

The plan should work as expected. Let me check it once more:

1. "gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_2": Go in front of grey_ball_1 in room_2.
2. "pick grey_ball_1 room_2": Pick up grey_ball_1 in room_2.
3. "gotodoor purple_door_2 room_2 room_4": Go in front of purple_door_2, connecting room_2 to room_4.
4. "toggle purple_door_2": Unlock purple_door_2.
5. "gotoroom room_2 room_4 purple_door_2": Go to room_4 from room_2 using purple_door_2.
6. "gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3": Go in front of grey_door_1, connecting room_4 to room_3.
7. "toggle grey_door_1": Unlock grey_door_1.
8. "gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1": Go to room_3 from room_4 using grey_door_1.
9. "gotoempty": Go in front of an empty position in room_3.
10. "drop grey_ball_1 room_3": Drop grey_ball_1 in room_3.
11. "gotoobject blue_box_1 room_3": Go in front of blue_box_1 in room_3.

Wait, I just realized something. I think I'm overthinking this. Let me reconsider the problem.

The goal is to be in front of blue_box_1, which is in room_3. I'm starting in room_2. I can't go through room_1 due to the constraints. The only path is through room_4.

But do I really need to pick up the grey_ball_1? The constraint says "you are holding some object" must hold in at least one state. So, I could pick up grey_ball_1 and then drop it immediately, but that seems wasteful.

Actually, let me check if the plan I've proposed is optimal. I'm thinking I might not even need to drop grey_ball_1 if it's not necessary for the goal. Let me reread the goal:

"There is a box v such that "The following conditions are all true: "v is blue", "you are in front of v"""

It just says I need to be in front of a blue box. It doesn't mention anything about my hands being empty or holding an object. 

Let me check the preconditions for the "gotoobject" action:
"goto object": you may only go in front of an object x if you are in the same room as x.

It doesn't say I need empty hands to go in front of an object. So, technically, I can still be holding grey_ball_1 and be in front of blue_box_1.

But wait, I'm also confused by the meaning of "at least one state" in the constraints:
"The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'you are holding some object'"

Does this mean I need to hold an object at some point, and then I can drop it if I want, or does it mean I must hold the object in the final state?

I think the former makes more sense. The constraint just requires that I hold an object at some point during the execution of the plan, not necessarily in the final state.

So, if I want to ensure optimality (minimum number of actions), I can skip dropping grey_ball_1 if it's not necessary for achieving the goal.

Let me revise the plan:

1. "gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_2": Go in front of grey_ball_1 in room_2.
2. "pick grey_ball_1 room_2": Pick up grey_ball_1 in room_2.
3. "gotodoor purple_door_2 room_2 room_4": Go in front of purple_door_2, connecting room_2 to room_4.
4. "toggle purple_door_2": Unlock purple_door_2.
5. "gotoroom room_2 room_4 purple_door_2": Go to room_4 from room_2 using purple_door_2.
6. "gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3": Go in front of grey_door_1, connecting room_4 to room_3.
7. "toggle grey_door_1": Unlock grey_door_1.
8. "gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1": Go to room_3 from room_4 using grey_door_1.
9. "gotoobject blue_box_1 room_3": Go in front of blue_box_1 in room_3.

This plan has 9 steps, which is more optimal than the previous 11-step plan.

Let me check this against the constraints once more:
1. I never enter room_1 ✓
2. green_door_1 remains locked ✓
3. purple_door_1 remains locked ✓
4. grey_door_1 is unlocked at some point ✓
5. I hold grey_ball_1 at some point (and in the final state) ✓

Actually, let me double check that I can use the "gotoobject" action while holding an object. The preconditions for "gotoobject" don't say I can't be holding an object. It just says I need to be in the same room as the object I want to go to. So, I think this plan should work.

Actually, let me think about one more thing. While the 9-step plan seems optimal, there's a possibility that I might need to drop the grey_ball_1 to complete the goal. 

Let me reread the goal one more time:
"There is a box v such that "The following conditions are all true: "v is blue", "you are in front of v"""

This just says I need to be in front of a blue box. Nothing about holding or not holding objects.

To optimize, I know that I need to:
1. Hold an object at some point (constraint 5)
2. Unlock grey_door_1 at some point (constraint 4)
3. End up in front of blue_box_1

It seems like holding grey_ball_1 and not dropping it gives the most optimal plan, since it satisfies the "holding an object" constraint while avoiding the extra steps to drop it.

So, I believe the 9-step plan is optimal. I'm confident it will work, but let me double-check the action descriptions one more time to be sure.

The effects of "pick" are:
"pick": After performing this action regarding an object x, (i) you are no longer in front of x, (ii) your hands are no longer empty, (iii) you are carrying x, (iv) x is no longer in the room, and (v) if x was blocking some door, then it is no longer blocking that door.

And the preconditions for "gotoobject" are:
"goto object": you may only go in front of an object x if you are in the same room as x.

The effects of "gotoobject" are:
"goto object": After performing this action regarding an object x, (i) if you were in front of some object or door x0, then you are no longer in front of x0 and (ii) you are in front of object x.

There's nothing in these descriptions that suggests I can't use "gotoobject" while holding another object.

Given all these considerations, the most optimal plan is:

1. "gotoobject grey_ball_1 room_2": Go in front of grey_ball_1 in room_2.
2. "pick grey_ball_1 room_2": Pick up grey_ball_1 in room_2.
3. "gotodoor purple_door_2 room_2 room_4": Go in front of purple_door_2, connecting room_2 to room_4.
4. "toggle purple_door_2": Unlock purple_door_2.
5. "gotoroom room_2 room_4 purple_door_2": Go to room_4 from room_2 using purple_door_2.
6. "gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3": Go in front of grey_door_1, connecting room_4 to room_3.
7. "toggle grey_door_1": Unlock grey_door_1.
8. "gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1": Go to room_3 from room_4 using grey_door_1.
9. "gotoobject blue_box_1 room_3": Go in front of blue_box_1 in room_3.

Let's confirm this is the right plan.
