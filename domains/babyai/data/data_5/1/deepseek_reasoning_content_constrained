Okay, let's try to figure out this planning problem. Hmm. The goal is to end up in front of a grey door that connects room_3 and room_4, which is unlocked. The door in question here is grey_door_1 because that's the grey door connecting those two rooms. Also, there are a bunch of constraints we need to satisfy.

First, let's recap the initial state. The agent starts in room_2. All doors are locked initially. The relevant doors are red_door_1 (connecting room_1 and 2), purple_door_1 (room_1 and 3), blue_door_1 (room_2 and 4), and grey_door_1 (room_3 and 4). All are locked. The objects are in various rooms: room_1 has yellow_box_1, red_ball_1, grey_ball_1, grey_ball_2; room_3 has blue_box_1 and yellow_ball_1; room_4 has grey_ball_3 and purple_ball_1.

The goal is to have a grey door (grey_door_1) connecting room_3 and 4, be in front of it, and have it unlocked. Also, the constraints are:

1. Must be in room_4 at least once.
2. If in room_4, must have held an object before.
3. blue_door_1 must always stay locked.
4. Must be in front of grey_door_1 at least once.
5. If in front of grey_door_1, must have been in front of red_ball_1 earlier.
6. Must hold an object at some point.
7. red_door_1 must be unlocked at some point.

So, the plan needs to get to room_3 or room_4 to reach grey_door_1. Since starting in room_2, maybe go through room_1 to room_3, then to room_4. But doors are locked. Let's see:

First, the agent needs to unlock some doors. Since red_door_1 is between room_1 and 2, and it's locked. To open a door, you need to toggle it when in front of it. So to unlock red_door_1, the agent must first go to red_door_1 from room_2, then toggle it. But wait, red_door_1 connects room_1 and 2. The agent is in room_2. So "gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_1" requires that the agent is in a room connected by the door. Then, the position in front of the door in room_2 must not be blocked. Are there any objects blocking doors? The initial state doesn't mention any objects blocking doors. Wait, the preconditions for gotodoor include that there's no object blocking the position in front of the door in the current room. Since the initial state doesn't list any objects in front of doors, maybe it's safe. So the agent can go to red_door_1 from room_2.

But first, the agent is in room_2. So to unlock red_door_1, which is locked, the steps would be:

1. gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_1
2. toggle red_door_1 (unlocks it)
But the constraint says that red_door_1 must be unlocked at some point, which this would satisfy. Then, with red_door_1 unlocked, the agent can go from room_2 to room_1 via red_door_1.

Once in room_1, the agent can go to purple_door_1 (connecting to room_3). But purple_door_1 is locked. To unlock it, need to toggle it. So:

3. gotoroom room_2 room_1 red_door_1 (after unlocking)
4. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_3
5. toggle purple_door_1 (unlocks it)
Then, go to room_3 via purple_door_1.

Once in room_3, the grey_door_1 connects to room_4. But grey_door_1 is locked. So need to unlock it. But to do that, the agent must be in front of grey_door_1. But grey_door_1 connects room_3 and 4. So in room_3, the agent can go to the door:

6. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4
7. toggle grey_door_1 (unlocks it)
Then, go to room_4 via grey_door_1. But wait, the problem says that the final goal is to be in front of grey_door_1 when it's unlocked. So maybe after step 7, the agent is already in front of grey_door_1, which is now unlocked, satisfying the goal. But the goal requires that the door is not locked and you're in front of it. So maybe that's already achieved after step 7. However, the constraints also require that the agent must be in room_4 at least once. So need to enter room_4.

Wait, let's check the goal again: "There is a door d such that d is grey, connects room_3 and 4, you are in front of d, and d is not locked." So d is grey_door_1. So the final state must have the agent in front of grey_door_1, which is unlocked. However, the agent could be in room_3 or room_4. Because to be in front of a door, you are in one of the rooms it connects. So if you're in room_3 and in front of grey_door_1, that's valid. Or in room_4. But to satisfy the constraint that the agent must be in room_4 at least once, that's another requirement. So the plan needs to get to room_4 once.

But how to get to room_4? The doors connecting to room_4 are blue_door_1 (from room_2 to 4, but blue_door_1 must remain locked always) and grey_door_1 (from room_3 to 4, which we can unlock). So the only way to get to room_4 is via grey_door_1 from room_3. So after unlocking grey_door_1, the agent can go to room_4. But the final goal is to be in front of grey_door_1 (in either room_3 or 4) and have it unlocked. So maybe the agent can stay in room_3, in front of grey_door_1, after unlocking it, which meets the goal. But the constraint says that the agent must have been in room_4 at least once. So the plan must include going into room_4.

Therefore, after unlocking grey_door_1 in room_3, the agent needs to go through it to room_4, then maybe come back to room_3 to be in front of the door again. Or perhaps there's another way. Let's outline steps:

So possible steps:

1. Unlock red_door_1 (from room_2)
   - goto red_door_1 in room_2
   - toggle to unlock
2. Go to room_1 via red_door_1
3. Unlock purple_door_1 (from room_1)
   - goto purple_door_1 in room_1
   - toggle to unlock
4. Go to room_3 via purple_door_1
5. Unlock grey_door_1 (from room_3)
   - goto grey_door_1 in room_3
   - toggle to unlock
6. Now, in front of grey_door_1, which is unlocked. This meets the goal, but we need to be in room_4 at least once. So the agent must then go to room_4 via grey_door_1.

But then, after entering room_4, we need to be in front of grey_door_1 again. Wait, but after going to room_4, the agent is in room_4, but not in front of the door. So maybe after entering room_4, the agent needs to go to the door again (grey_door_1 from room_4's side). But in room_4, to go to grey_door_1, the agent would need to perform gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3, but is there an object blocking? The initial state in room_4 has grey_ball_3 and purple_ball_1. Are they blocking the door? The problem doesn't say, but the initial state doesn't mention any objects blocking doors. So assuming they are not. So the agent can go to the door in room_4, but then being in front of grey_door_1 from room_4 would satisfy the goal. However, the problem states that the goal is to be in front of the door (grey_door_1) which connects room_3 and 4, and the door is unlocked. So whether you are in room_3 or 4 in front of the door, it's okay. But the constraint says that you must be in front of grey_door_1 at least once, which is covered here. But also, the agent must have been in front of red_ball_1 before being in front of grey_door_1. So the agent must have visited red_ball_1's location at some point before the first time they are in front of grey_door_1.

So in the steps I outlined, when does the agent get in front of red_ball_1? They haven't yet. So we need to add steps where the agent goes in front of red_ball_1 before being in front of grey_door_1. Since red_ball_1 is in room_1. So perhaps after entering room_1, the agent needs to go to red_ball_1. Let's adjust the steps:

After step 2 (arrive in room_1):

3. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_1
   (This satisfies the constraint that being in front of grey_door_1 requires having been in front of red_ball_1 earlier)

Then proceed to unlock purple_door_1, etc.

So updated steps:

1. gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_1
2. toggle red_door_1 (now unlocked)
3. gotoroom room_2 room_1 red_door_1
4. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_1 (to fulfill the constraint)
5. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_3
6. toggle purple_door_1 (unlock)
7. gotoroom room_1 room_3 purple_door_1
8. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4
9. toggle grey_door_1 (unlock)
10. Now, agent is in front of grey_door_1 in room_3, which is unlocked. This meets the goal, but we need to be in room_4. So then:

11. gotoroom room_3 room_4 grey_door_1 (now in room_4)
    This satisfies the constraint of being in room_4. Also, before entering room_4, the agent must have held an object. Wait, the constraint says that if the agent is in room_4 in some state, there must be an earlier state where they were holding an object. So in this plan so far, the agent hasn't picked up any object. So they need to hold an object before entering room_4.

Hmm, so the agent must pick up an object at some point, and then enter room_4 after that. Let's see. How can that be done?

The agent is in room_1 after step 3. They could pick up red_ball_1. Let's see. After step 4 (gotoobject red_ball_1 room_1), the agent is in front of it. Then, they can pick it up. Then, they can proceed. But after that, they need to drop it somewhere to have their hands free to toggle doors. Let's adjust:

4. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_1
5. pick red_ball_1 room_1 (now holding it)
6. drop red_ball_1 room_1 (but where? needs to be in front of an empty position. So maybe after picking, they need to go to an empty spot and drop.)

Wait, but dropping requires being in front of an empty position. So after picking red_ball_1, the agent is in room_1, and needs to drop it. But to drop, they need to go to an empty position. So:

After step 5 (pick red_ball_1), the agent is holding it. Then, they need to go to an empty position in room_1.

6. gotoempty (moves to empty spot in room_1)
7. drop red_ball_1 room_1 (drops it there)
But this would mean that red_ball_1 is now in the empty spot. But is this necessary? The constraints require that the agent must have held an object at some point, which is satisfied by step 5. However, the constraint says that if the agent is in room_4, they must have held an object before. So if the agent picks up red_ball_1 in room_1, then later enters room_4, that satisfies the constraint. So steps could be:

1. gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_1
2. toggle red_door_1 (unlock)
3. gotoroom room_2 room_1 red_door_1
4. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_1 (now in front)
5. pick red_ball_1 room_1 (now holding)
6. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_3 (but need to be in same room as door. So in room_1, goto purple_door_1)
7. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_3
8. toggle purple_door_1 (unlock)
9. gotoroom room_1 room_3 purple_door_1 (now in room_3)
10. Now, agent is holding red_ball_1. Need to drop it? Because to toggle doors, they need to be in front of them, which requires not holding anything? Wait, no. The preconditions for toggling a door is that you are in front of it. The toggle action doesn't require you to be free-handed, unless the door is blocked. Wait, no, the preconditions for toggle are only that you are in front of the door. So you can toggle a door while holding an object. So maybe the agent can carry red_ball_1 through the process.

But then, when going to room_3, the agent is holding the ball. Then, they need to unlock grey_door_1. So:

10. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4
11. toggle grey_door_1 (unlocks)
12. Now, the agent is in front of grey_door_1, which is unlocked. This meets the goal's conditions. Then, the agent must enter room_4 to satisfy the constraint. So:

13. gotoroom room_3 room_4 grey_door_1 (now in room_4)
At this point, the agent is in room_4, and had previously held red_ball_1, which satisfies the constraint. Then, perhaps the agent needs to go back to room_3 to be in front of grey_door_1 again. But the goal just requires that in the final state, the agent is in front of the door. So perhaps after entering room_4, the agent can go back to room_3 via grey_door_1 (which is unlocked), then go to the door again. But that adds steps.

Alternatively, after step 13, the agent is in room_4. To be in front of grey_door_1 again, they can:

14. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3 (now in front of the door from room_4's side)
But the goal is satisfied as long as the agent is in front of the door (in either room) and it's unlocked. So step 11 (toggle grey_door_1) makes the door unlocked. Then, step 10 (after toggle) has the agent in front of grey_door_1 in room_3. So that's the final state? But then, how do we satisfy the constraint of being in room_4? Because step 13 is entering room_4, which is required. But after that, to have the final state in front of the door, maybe the agent can go back to room_3.

But this is getting complicated. Let's outline the steps again, considering all constraints:

Constraints:

- Must be in room_4 at least once. Check.
- If in room_4, must have held an object earlier. Check (held red_ball_1 before entering room_4).
- blue_door_1 must always stay locked. Since blue_door_1 is in room_2 and 4. The agent never interacts with it, so it remains locked. Check.
- Must be in front of grey_door_1 at least once. Check (steps 10, 11).
- If in front of grey_door_1, must have been in front of red_ball_1 earlier. Check (step 4).
- Must hold an object at some point. Check (step 5).
- red_door_1 must be unlocked at some point. Check (step 2).

So the plan would be:

1. gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_1
2. toggle red_door_1
3. gotoroom room_2 room_1 red_door_1
4. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_1
5. pick red_ball_1 room_1
6. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_3
7. toggle purple_door_1
8. gotoroom room_1 room_3 purple_door_1
9. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4
10. toggle grey_door_1
11. gotoroom room_3 room_4 grey_door_1 (enter room_4)
12. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3 (go back to door in room_4)
But then the agent is in front of grey_door_1 in room_4, which is unlocked. So this satisfies the goal. But is there a shorter path?

Alternatively, after step 10, the agent is in front of grey_door_1 in room_3, which is unlocked. So the goal is already met. But the constraint requires being in room_4. So steps 1-10 and 11 (enter room_4). Then after entering, maybe the plan can end. But the goal is to be in front of the door. So perhaps step 10 is the last action. Wait, no. Because after step 10, the agent is in front of grey_door_1, which is now unlocked, so that's the goal. But then, the constraint requires being in room_4. So to satisfy that, the agent must enter room_4. So after step 10, the agent must go to room_4. Then, perhaps return to room_3 and be in front of the door again. But that adds steps. Is there a way to be in front of the door in room_4?

Alternatively, after step 11 (in room_4), the agent can go to grey_door_1 from room_4:

12. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3
13. Now, in front of grey_door_1 in room_4, which is unlocked.

This would satisfy the goal. But the problem's goal is just that there exists a door d (grey_door_1) where you are in front of it and it's unlocked. So steps 12 and 13 would do that, but then the agent is in room_4. But maybe the final state can be in room_4 in front of the door. However, the agent needs to be in front of grey_door_1, which can be from either room. So perhaps the plan can end after step 13.

But the steps would be:

1. gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_1
2. toggle red_door_1
3. gotoroom room_2 room_1 red_door_1
4. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_1
5. pick red_ball_1 room_1
6. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_3
7. toggle purple_door_1
8. gotoroom room_1 room_3 purple_door_1
9. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4
10. toggle grey_door_1
11. gotoroom room_3 room_4 grey_door_1 (now in room_4)
12. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3 (now in front of the door in room_4)
13. Now, the agent is in front of grey_door_1 (in room_4), which is unlocked. This meets the goal. Also, all constraints are satisfied:

- In room_4 (step 11)
- Held red_ball_1 (step 5) before entering room_4 (step 11)
- blue_door_1 remains locked
- Been in front of grey_door_1 (steps 9, 12)
- Before being in front of grey_door_1 in step 9, the agent was in front of red_ball_1 (step 4)
- Held an object (step 5)
- red_door_1 was unlocked (step 2)

But wait, in step 12, after entering room_4, the agent goes to the door again. But when you use gotoroom to go to room_4, you are no longer in front of the door. Because the effect of gotoroom is that you leave the previous room and are no longer in front of any object/door. So when you go from room_3 to room_4 via grey_door_1 (step 11), you are now in room_4, not in front of anything. So to get in front of grey_door_1 from room_4, you need to do gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3 (step 12), which is possible. Then, you are in front of the door in room_4, which is unlocked. So this meets the goal.

But wait, the goal requires that you are in front of the door and it's unlocked. The door is already unlocked, so step 12 puts you in front of it. So the final state would be step 12. But step 12 is gotodoor, which is just moving to the door. Then, the door is already unlocked from step 10. So that's acceptable.

So the plan would be:

1. gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_1
2. toggle red_door_1
3. gotoroom room_2 room_1 red_door_1
4. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_1
5. pick red_ball_1 room_1
6. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_3
7. toggle purple_door_1
8. gotoroom room_1 room_3 purple_door_1
9. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4
10. toggle grey_door_1
11. gotoroom room_3 room_4 grey_door_1
12. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3

But wait, in step 12, the agent is in room_4 and goes to grey_door_1 (connecting to room_3). The preconditions for gotodoor are that you are in a room connected by the door. Since grey_door_1 connects room_3 and 4, the agent in room_4 can go to the door. So that's allowed.

Now, does this plan satisfy all constraints? Let's check each one:

1. Must be in room_4 at least once: yes (step 11)
2. If in room_4, held object before: step 5 (picked red_ball_1) before step 11. Check.
3. blue_door_1 remains locked: the plan never touches blue_door_1. Check.
4. Must be in front of grey_door_1: steps 9 and 12. Check.
5. If in front of grey_door_1 (step 9, first time), earlier state must be in front of red_ball_1 (step 4). Check.
6. Must hold an object: step 5. Check.
7. red_door_1 must be unlocked: step 2. Check.

Yes, all constraints are satisfied. Also, the goal is achieved in step 12: the agent is in front of grey_door_1 (room_4 side), which is unlocked. So this plan works.

But wait, after step 10, the agent is in room_3, in front of grey_door_1, which is now unlocked. So maybe the agent can achieve the goal there, without going to room_4. But the constraint requires being in room_4. So steps 11 and 12 are necessary. 

Alternatively, is there a shorter path? Let's count the steps. The current plan has 12 steps. But maybe some steps can be optimized.

After step 5, the agent is holding red_ball_1. Then, they go to purple_door_1 (step 6). But when they go to purple_door_1, they need to be in room_1, which they are. Then, toggle the door (step 7). Then, go to room_3 (step 8). Then, go to grey_door_1 (step 9), toggle (step 10), go to room_4 (step 11), go to door (step 12). That's 12 actions.

But maybe after step 10, the agent is already in front of grey_door_1 (room_3) and it's unlocked, so the goal is achieved. But the constraint requires that the agent must be in room_4. So the agent must go to room_4 at least once. So even if the goal is achieved in step 10, the agent must still go to room_4. So steps 11 and 12 are necessary.

Alternatively, maybe after step 10, the agent can enter room_4 (step 11) and that's enough. The final goal is to be in front of grey_door_1, but the agent is in room_4, not in front of the door. So need to go back to the door in room_4. So steps 11 and 12 are needed.

Alternatively, after step 11, the agent is in room_4 and then can go to the door. So steps 11 and 12. So the plan must have those steps.

Is there a way to avoid carrying red_ball_1 all the way? Because the agent needs to have held an object, but maybe they can drop it earlier.

Wait, after step 5, the agent picks up red_ball_1. Then, they need to go through doors. But doors can be opened even if holding an object. So perhaps they can carry it all the way. But when they get to room_3, they can drop it. Let's see:

Alternative plan:

1. gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_1
2. toggle red_door_1
3. gotoroom room_2 room_1 red_door_1
4. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_1
5. pick red_ball_1 room_1
6. gotoempty (room_1)
7. drop red_ball_1 room_1
8. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_3
9. toggle purple_door_1
10. gotoroom room_1 room_3 purple_door_1
11. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4
12. toggle grey_door_1
13. gotoroom room_3 room_4 grey_door_1
14. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3

But this adds steps 6 and 7 (drop). This makes the plan longer. So original plan is better.

So the initial plan is better. Now, check if there's any shorter path.

Wait, after step 5, the agent is holding red_ball_1. Then, they proceed to purple_door_1. When they go to room_3 (step 8), they are holding the ball. Then, when they go to grey_door_1 (step 9), they can toggle it (step 10). Then, when they go to room_4 (step 11), they are still holding the ball. But in room_4, when they try to goto the door (step 12), they are still holding the ball. That's allowed. Then, they can drop the ball in room_4, but it's not necessary for the plan. But the plan doesn't require dropping. However, the drop action would require being in front of an empty spot. But since the goal is just to be in front of the door, maybe the agent can stay holding the ball. But does that violate any constraints? No. The constraints only require that they held an object at some point. So even if they are still holding it, it's okay.

But in the current plan, the agent is holding the ball until the end. But there's no requirement to drop it. So it's okay. So steps 5-12 are done while holding red_ball_1. That's possible.

But wait, when you perform gotoempty, you can be in front of an empty spot. But the agent can carry the ball through all steps. The only problem would be if they need to pick up another object, but they don't need to. So the plan is valid.

So the final plan is:

1. gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_1
2. toggle red_door_1
3. gotoroom room_2 room_1 red_door_1
4. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_1
5. pick red_ball_1 room_1
6. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_3
7. toggle purple_door_1
8. gotoroom room_1 room_3 purple_door_1
9. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4
10. toggle grey_door_1
11. gotoroom room_3 room_4 grey_door_1
12. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3

Wait, the door's name is grey_door_1, not grey_door_1. So step 12 should be grey_door_1.

Yes. So steps 9, 10, 12 should refer to grey_door_1.

So the correct plan is:

```
gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_1
toggle red_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_1 red_door_1
gotoobject red_ball_1 room_1
pick red_ball_1 room_1
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_3
toggle purple_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_3 purple_door_1
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4
toggle grey_door_1
gotoroom room_3 room_4 grey_door_1
gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3
```

But wait, in step 12, after entering room_4, the agent needs to go to grey_door_1 from room_4. So the correct action is "gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3".

Yes.

Now, check each action's preconditions:

1. gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_1: Agent is in room_2, which is connected via red_door_1. No object blocking. Check.
2. toggle red_door_1: In front of red_door_1. Check.
3. gotoroom room_2 room_1 red_door_1: door is now unlocked. Check.
4. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_1: agent is in room_1. Check.
5. pick red_ball_1 room_1: agent is in room_1 and in front of it. Hands empty. Check.
6. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_3: agent is in room_1. Check. No object blocking.
7. toggle purple_door_1: in front of it. Check.
8. gotoroom room_1 room_3 purple_door_1: door is unlocked. Check.
9. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4: agent is in room_3. Check.
10. toggle grey_door_1: in front of it. Check.
11. gotoroom room_3 room_4 grey_door_1: door is unlocked. Check.
12. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3: agent is in room_4. Check. No object blocking.

All preconditions are met. Effects are correct.

This plan has 12 actions. Is there a shorter plan? For example, can the agent drop the ball earlier to save steps? Let's see. Suppose after step 5, the agent drops the ball:

5. pick red_ball_1 room_1
6. gotoempty room_1
7. drop red_ball_1 room_1

Then proceed. But this adds two more steps. So the plan becomes longer. So the initial plan is better.

Yes, the initial plan is optimal with 12 steps. Are there any shorter paths?

Alternative approach: Maybe unlock red_door_1 and go to room_1, then unlock purple_door_1, go to room_3, unlock grey_door_1, then go to room_4, and then go back to room_3 to be in front of the door. But that would require more steps.

Another alternative: Can the agent avoid going to room_4 and satisfy all constraints? No, because the constraint requires being in room_4 at least once. So must enter room_4.

Another thought: After step 10 (toggle grey_door_1), the agent is in front of grey_door_1 in room_3, which is unlocked. If the plan ends here, then the agent hasn't entered room_4, violating the constraint. So steps 11 and 12 are necessary.

Thus, the given plan is valid and optimal.
