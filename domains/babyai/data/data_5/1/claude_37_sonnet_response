Let's summarize the problem:

We have a 2D gridworld with 4 rooms arranged in a square formation. There are doors connecting the rooms, and objects (boxes and balls) in the rooms. Each door, box, and ball has a color.

The initial state is:
- We are in room_2.
- Objects are distributed across rooms.
- All doors are locked.
- The door configurations are:
  - room_1 and room_2 are connected via red_door_1
  - room_1 and room_3 are connected via purple_door_1
  - room_2 and room_4 are connected via blue_door_1
  - room_3 and room_4 are connected via grey_door_1

The goal is:
- There is a grey door connecting room_3 and room_4 (which is grey_door_1).
- You are in front of this door.
- This door is unlocked.

Constraints:
1. You must be in room_4 at some point.
2. Before being in room_4, you must be holding some object.
3. blue_door_1 must always be locked.
4. You must be in front of grey_door_1 at some point.
5. Before being in front of grey_door_1, you must be in front of red_ball_1.
6. You must be holding some object at some point.
7. red_door_1 must be unlocked at some point.

Given constraints 3 and 1, we cannot use blue_door_1 to get to room_4. So we need to go through room_1, room_3, and then to room_4 using grey_door_1.

Given constraint 5, we need to be in front of red_ball_1 (which is in room_1) before going to grey_door_1. And given constraint 2, we need to be holding some object before going to room_4.

Let's plan our steps:

1. Unlock red_door_1 to go from room_2 to room_1.
2. Go to room_1 using red_door_1.
3. Go to red_ball_1 in room_1 (to satisfy constraint 5).
4. Pick up an object from room_1 (to satisfy constraints 2 and 6).
5. Unlock purple_door_1 to go from room_1 to room_3.
6. Go to room_3 using purple_door_1.
7. Unlock grey_door_1 to go from room_3 to room_4.
8. Go to room_4 using grey_door_1.
9. Drop the object (to ensure we can toggle the door in the next step).
10. Go back to room_3 using grey_door_1.
11. Go to grey_door_1 in room_3.
12. Unlock grey_door_1.

However, there's a constraint that we need to be in front of grey_door_1 and the goal is also to be in front of an unlocked grey_door_1. So after unlocking grey_door_1, we need to ensure that we're in front of it.

Let's refine the plan:

1. Go to red_door_1 in room_2.
2. Toggle red_door_1 to unlock it (to satisfy constraint 7).
3. Go to room_1 using red_door_1.
4. Go to red_ball_1 in room_1 (to satisfy constraint 5).
5. Pick up an object from room_1 (to satisfy constraints 2 and 6).
6. Go to purple_door_1 in room_1.
7. Toggle purple_door_1 to unlock it.
8. Go to room_3 using purple_door_1.
9. Go to grey_door_1 in room_3 (to satisfy constraint 4, but only after satisfying constraint 5).
10. Toggle grey_door_1 to unlock it.
11. Drop the object (so we can interact with doors).
12. Go to grey_door_1 again (to satisfy the goal of being in front of an unlocked grey_door_1).

This seems to satisfy all constraints and achieve the goal. However, have I missed anything?

Let's double-check the constraints:
1. We'll be in room_4 at step 11. ✅
2. We'll be holding an object before going to room_4. ✅
3. blue_door_1 will remain locked. ✅
4. We'll be in front of grey_door_1 at step 9. ✅
5. We'll be in front of red_ball_1 at step 4, before being in front of grey_door_1. ✅
6. We'll be holding an object at step 5. ✅
7. red_door_1 will be unlocked at step 2. ✅

But I just realized that in the goal, we need to be in front of the unlocked grey_door_1, but the door is in between room_3 and room_4, so we need to be on one side of the door, either in room_3 or room_4. Let's choose room_3. Also, I made the step where we go to room_4, which is not strictly necessary for the goal, but is required by constraint 1.

Let me revise the plan:

1. Go to red_door_1 in room_2.
2. Toggle red_door_1 to unlock it (to satisfy constraint 7).
3. Go to room_1 using red_door_1.
4. Go to red_ball_1 in room_1 (to satisfy constraint 5).
5. Pick up an object from room_1 (to satisfy constraints 2 and 6).
6. Go to purple_door_1 in room_1.
7. Toggle purple_door_1 to unlock it.
8. Go to room_3 using purple_door_1.
9. Go to grey_door_1 in room_3 (to satisfy constraint 4, but only after satisfying constraint 5).
10. Toggle grey_door_1 to unlock it.
11. Go to room_4 using grey_door_1 (to satisfy constraint 1).
12. Drop the object (so we can interact with doors).
13. Go back to room_3 using grey_door_1.
14. Go to grey_door_1 in room_3 (to satisfy the goal of being in front of an unlocked grey_door_1).

Ok, I think this plan will work. Let's fill in detailed steps.

First, I need to understand from what room we need to approach grey_door_1 in the goal. The goal says "you are in front of d" and "d is grey" and "room_3 and room_4 are connected via d". So we need to be in front of grey_door_1, which connects room_3 and room_4. We could approach it from either room, so let's choose room_3.

Also, I see now that we're being redundant in the plan with repeatedly going to grey_door_1. We just need to go to grey_door_1 once, before we go to room_4, and then after we've visited room_4, we need to come back to room_3 and go to grey_door_1 again (at which point it will be unlocked, satisfying the goal).

I also note that in the initial state, the doors connecting the rooms are locked. So we need to unlock the doors before using them.

Now let's translate the high-level plan into the specific actions from the problem:

1. gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_1
2. toggle red_door_1
3. gotoroom room_2 room_1 red_door_1
4. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_1
5. pick red_ball_1 room_1  # red_ball_1 is a good choice because it's in room_1
6. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_3
7. toggle purple_door_1
8. gotoroom room_1 room_3 purple_door_1
9. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4
10. toggle grey_door_1
11. gotoroom room_3 room_4 grey_door_1  # to satisfy constraint 1
12. gotoempty  # we need to be in front of an empty position to drop the object
13. drop red_ball_1 room_4  # we drop the ball in room_4
14. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3  # go back to the door
15. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1  # go back to room_3
16. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4  # go to the door from room_3 side to satisfy the goal

Actually, I'm unsure about 15 and 16. Let's validate:
- Constraint 1: We need to visit room_4, which we do in 11.
- Constraint 2: Before visiting room_4, we need to hold an object, which we do in 5.
- Constraint 3: blue_door_1 remains locked.
- Constraint 4: We need to be in front of grey_door_1, which we are in 9.
- Constraint 5: Before being in front of grey_door_1, we need to be in front of red_ball_1, which we are in 4.
- Constraint 6: We need to hold an object, which we do in 5.
- Constraint 7: red_door_1 must be unlocked, which it is from 2.

We're good on the constraints, so let's make sure we satisfy the goal.

The goal is that there's a door d such that:
- d is grey
- room_3 and room_4 are connected via d
- you are in front of d
- d is not locked

This is satisfied if we're in front of grey_door_1 and it's unlocked. So we want to end up in front of grey_door_1 when it's unlocked. We unlock grey_door_1 in step 10, but we're not in front of it at the end of the plan.

Let's revise the plan at step 15 and 16:
- After step 14, we're in front of grey_door_1 in room_4.
- Since the goal is to be in front of grey_door_1 when it's unlocked, we're done. But wait, the goal also says "room_3 and room_4 are connected via d", so we might need to be on the room_3 side of the door.

Now I notice an issue. When we arrive at gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4 in step 9, we're not actually in front of the door yet, we are in room_3 and need to go to the door. After we toggle grey_door_1 and go to room_4, the action gotoroom room_3 room_4 grey_door_1 might have the effect of taking us away from the door, not to the door. So after we go to room_4, we need to go to the door again.

The confusion stems from our need to be in front of the door to unlock it, but after using the door to go to room_4, we might not be in front of it anymore.

Let me revise the plan, focusing on the mechanics of the actions:

1. gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_1  # Go to the door in room_2
2. toggle red_door_1  # Unlock the door
3. gotoroom room_2 room_1 red_door_1  # Go to room_1
4. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_1  # Go to the ball in room_1
5. pick red_ball_1 room_1  # Pick up the ball
6. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_3  # Go to the door in room_1
7. toggle purple_door_1  # Unlock the door
8. gotoroom room_1 room_3 purple_door_1  # Go to room_3
9. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4  # Go to the door in room_3
10. toggle grey_door_1  # Unlock the door
11. gotoroom room_3 room_4 grey_door_1  # Go to room_4
12. gotoempty  # Need to be in front of an empty position to drop
13. drop red_ball_1 room_4  # Drop the ball
14. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3  # Go to the door in room_4
15. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1  # Go back to room_3
16. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4  # Go to the door from room_3 side (we should be at grey_door_1, which is unlocked)

But it turns out we can optimize this by simply stopping at 10. We've unlocked the door, we've stood in front of it. Let's double check the goal:
- Door d is grey: Yes, grey_door_1 is grey.
- room_3 and room_4 are connected via d: Yes, room_3 and room_4 are connected via grey_door_1.
- You are in front of d: Yes, after step 9, we are in front of grey_door_1.
- d is not locked: Yes, after step 10, grey_door_1 is not locked.

So we've achieved the goal! But let's check the constraints again:
- Constraint 1: We need to visit room_4, which we don't do if we stop at step 10. So we need to go to room_4.
- Constraint 2: Before visiting room_4, we need to hold an object, which we do from 5.
- Constraint 3: blue_door_1 remains locked.
- Constraint 4: We need to be in front of grey_door_1, which we are in 9.
- Constraint 5: Before being in front of grey_door_1, we need to be in front of red_ball_1, which we are in 4.
- Constraint 6: We need to hold an object, which we do in 5.
- Constraint 7: red_door_1 must be unlocked, which it is from 2.

Hmm, we need to visit room_4, which means we need to go to step 11. But after we go to room_4, we're no longer in front of grey_door_1, and the goal requires us to be in front of grey_door_1 when it's unlocked.

So we need to come back to room_3 after visiting room_4, and end up in front of grey_door_1 in room_3. Let's adjust the plan:

1. gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_1  # Go to the door in room_2
2. toggle red_door_1  # Unlock the door
3. gotoroom room_2 room_1 red_door_1  # Go to room_1
4. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_1  # Go to the ball in room_1
5. pick red_ball_1 room_1  # Pick up the ball
6. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_3  # Go to the door in room_1
7. toggle purple_door_1  # Unlock the door
8. gotoroom room_1 room_3 purple_door_1  # Go to room_3
9. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4  # Go to the door in room_3
10. toggle grey_door_1  # Unlock the door
11. gotoroom room_3 room_4 grey_door_1  # Go to room_4
12. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3  # Go to the door in room_4
13. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1  # Go back to room_3
14. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4  # Go to the door from room_3 side (we should be at grey_door_1, which is unlocked)

This plan satisfies all the constraints and achieves the goal. But wait, to toggle a door, our hands must be empty. So we need to add steps to drop the ball and pick it up later.

Actually, let me revisit the problem description. The preconditions for the "toggle" action say "you may only toggle a door d if you are in front of d", and there's nothing about your hands being empty. So maybe we can hold the ball while toggling the door.

Let me check the other actions to see if there's a conflict. The preconditions for "pick" say "you may only pick up an object x if (i) you are in the same room as x, and (ii) you are currently not holding any object." And the effect of "drop" is that "your hands are empty". These don't indicate that we need empty hands to toggle, so I think we can hold the ball while toggling the door.

Given that, our plan is correct, but let's streamline it:

1. gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_1  # Go to the door in room_2
2. toggle red_door_1  # Unlock the door
3. gotoroom room_2 room_1 red_door_1  # Go to room_1
4. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_1  # Go to the ball in room_1
5. pick red_ball_1 room_1  # Pick up the ball
6. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_3  # Go to the door in room_1
7. toggle purple_door_1  # Unlock the door
8. gotoroom room_1 room_3 purple_door_1  # Go to room_3
9. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4  # Go to the door in room_3
10. toggle grey_door_1  # Unlock the door
11. gotoroom room_3 room_4 grey_door_1  # Go to room_4
12. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3  # Go to the door in room_4
13. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1  # Go back to room_3
14. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4  # Go to the door from room_3 side (we should be at grey_door_1, which is unlocked)

But I realize a problem: after step 10, we toggle the door and it becomes unlocked, and then in step 11, we go through the door to room_4, and we're no longer in front of the door. But the goal is to have "you are in front of d (grey_door_1)" and "d is not locked". So we need to come back to room_3, go to the door from room_3 side, and then we're in the goal state. So steps 12, 13, and 14 are necessary.

Let's validate once more:
- Door d is grey: Yes, grey_door_1 is grey.
- room_3 and room_4 are connected via d: Yes, room_3 and room_4 are connected via grey_door_1.
- You are in front of d: Yes, after step 14, we are in front of grey_door_1 from the room_3 side.
- d is not locked: Yes, we unlocked grey_door_1 in step 10.

Constraints:
1. We need to visit room_4, which we do in step 11. ✅
2. Before visiting room_4, we need to hold an object, which we do from step 5. ✅
3. blue_door_1 remains locked. ✅
4. We need to be in front of grey_door_1, which we are in steps 9 and 14. ✅
5. Before being in front of grey_door_1, we need to be in front of red_ball_1, which we are in step 4, before step 9. ✅
6. We need to hold an object, which we do in step 5. ✅
7. red_door_1 must be unlocked, which it is from step 2. ✅

Looks like the plan satisfies all the constraints and achieves the goal. Let me clean it up:

1. gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_1  # Go to the door in room_2
2. toggle red_door_1  # Unlock the door
3. gotoroom room_2 room_1 red_door_1  # Go to room_1
4. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_1  # Go to the ball in room_1
5. pick red_ball_1 room_1  # Pick up the ball
6. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_3  # Go to the door in room_1
7. toggle purple_door_1  # Unlock the door
8. gotoroom room_1 room_3 purple_door_1  # Go to room_3
9. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4  # Go to the door in room_3
10. toggle grey_door_1  # Unlock the door
11. gotoroom room_3 room_4 grey_door_1  # Go to room_4
12. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3  # Go to the door in room_4
13. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1  # Go back to room_3
14. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4  # Go to the door from room_3 side

Actually, I think there's a simpler solution. We don't need to go to room_4 and come back. We can just stay in front of grey_door_1 after unlocking it, satisfying both the goal and all constraints. Let's see:

1. gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_1  # Go to the door in room_2
2. toggle red_door_1  # Unlock the door (Constraint 7: red_door_1 is unlocked)
3. gotoroom room_2 room_1 red_door_1  # Go to room_1
4. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_1  # Go to the ball in room_1 (Constraint 5: in front of red_ball_1)
5. pick red_ball_1 room_1  # Pick up the ball (Constraint 6: holding an object)
6. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_3  # Go to the door in room_1
7. toggle purple_door_1  # Unlock the door
8. gotoroom room_1 room_3 purple_door_1  # Go to room_3
9. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4  # Go to the door in room_3 (Constraint 4: in front of grey_door_1)
10. toggle grey_door_1  # Unlock the door
11. gotoroom room_3 room_4 grey_door_1  # Go to room_4 (Constraint 1: in room_4)
12. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3  # Go to the door in room_4
13. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1  # Go back to room_3
14. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4  # Go to the door from room_3 side

Constraint 2: Before entering room_4, you are holding the red ball.
Constraint 3: blue_door_1 remains locked (it's never unlocked in the plan).

Actually, now I think this is correct. We need to go to room_4 to satisfy constraint 1, and we need to end up in front of grey_door_1 from the room_3 side to satisfy the goal. So we need to go to room_4 and come back to room_3, ending up in front of grey_door_1.

I think we have finalized the plan.

Our optimal plan looks like this:

1. gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_1
2. toggle red_door_1
3. gotoroom room_2 room_1 red_door_1
4. gotoobject red_ball_1 room_1
5. pick red_ball_1 room_1
6. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_3
7. toggle purple_door_1
8. gotoroom room_1 room_3 purple_door_1
9. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4
10. toggle grey_door_1
11. gotoroom room_3 room_4 grey_door_1
12. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3
13. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1
14. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_4
