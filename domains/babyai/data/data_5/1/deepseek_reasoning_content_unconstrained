Okay, let's tackle this planning problem step by step. First, I need to understand the initial state and the goal. The agent is in room_2 initially, and all doors are locked. The goal is to find a grey door that connects room_3 and room_4, be in front of it, and have it unlocked. The constraints probably include not using certain actions or objects, but since the user didn't specify additional constraints beyond the problem description, I'll focus on the main goal.

So, the target door must be grey, connect room_3 and room_4, and be unlocked with the agent in front of it. Looking at the doors, the grey_door_1 is grey and connects room_3 and room_4. So that's the door we need. Currently, it's locked, so we need to unlock it.

But first, the agent needs to get to room_3 or room_4 to access the grey_door_1. Let's see the connections. From room_2, the doors are red_door_1 (connects to room_1) and blue_door_1 (connects to room_4). But all doors are locked. So the agent can't go through them unless they are unlocked. However, unlocking a door requires being in front of it and toggling it. But to get in front of a door, the agent must be in a room connected by that door. So for red_door_1 in room_2, the agent can go to it if there's no object blocking. Let's check the initial state. Are there any objects blocking doors? The initial state mentions objects in rooms but doesn't specify positions blocking doors. Wait, the "goto door" precondition says (ii) there's no object blocking the position in front of d in the current room. So if there's an object in front of the door, the agent can't go there. But the initial state doesn't list any such blockages. So perhaps the doors are not blocked by objects initially. So the agent can go to the doors in their current room.

So, starting in room_2, the agent can go to red_door_1 (connects room_2 and room_1) or blue_door_1 (connects room_2 and room_4). But both doors are locked. So the agent needs to toggle them. To toggle a door, they need to be in front of it. So first, the agent can go to the door, then toggle it to unlock.

Let's think: the agent is in room_2. They can go to blue_door_1 (since it's in room_2 connecting to room_4). So:

1. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_4
But wait, the gotodoor action's first precondition is that the agent is in a room which the door connects. So blue_door_1 connects room_2 and room_4. So the agent is in room_2, which is correct. Also, no object is blocking the door's position. Assuming that's true, then the agent can go to the door. Then, they can toggle it to unlock. So:

2. toggle blue_door_1 (unlocks it)

Then, the agent can go through blue_door_1 to room_4:

3. gotoroom room_2 room_4 blue_door_1

Now in room_4. The grey_door_1 connects room_4 and room_3. So the agent needs to get in front of grey_door_1 in room_4. Let's check if the grey_door_1 is locked. Initially, all doors are locked, so grey_door_1 is locked. So the agent needs to unlock it. But to unlock it, they need to be in front of it. So steps:

4. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3
5. toggle grey_door_1 (unlocks it)

Now, the grey_door_1 is unlocked, and the agent is in front of it. But the goal requires the agent to be in front of the door (grey_door_1) which is unlocked. So this satisfies the goal: the door is grey, connects room_3 and room_4, the agent is in front of it, and it's unlocked.

But wait, the problem states that the agent must be in front of the door (d) which is grey and connects room_3 and room_4. So after step 5, the agent is in front of grey_door_1 in room_4, and the door is unlocked. That meets all the goal conditions. So the plan would be:

gotoempty (to leave initial position, if needed? Wait, the agent starts in room_2. To go to the door, they need to use gotodoor. So first action is gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_4. Then toggle it, then gotoroom to room_4. Then gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3, toggle it. Then, after that, the agent is in front of grey_door_1, which is now unlocked. So the steps would be:

1. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_4
2. toggle blue_door_1
3. gotoroom room_2 room_4 blue_door_1
4. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3
5. toggle grey_door_1

But wait, when the agent uses gotoroom to move to room_4, they are no longer in front of any object or door. So when they arrive in room_4, they are not in front of anything. Then, they need to go to the grey_door_1 in room_4. So steps 4 and 5 are correct. After step 5, the agent is in front of grey_door_1, which is now unlocked. So the goal is achieved. That's five actions. Let me check if there's a shorter path.

Alternative: Can the agent go from room_2 to room_4 via blue_door_1 after unlocking it, then go to grey_door_1, toggle. That's the same steps. Is there a way to reach grey_door_1 via another path?

Alternatively, maybe the agent can go to room_1 via red_door_1, unlock it, then go to room_3 via purple_door_1, unlock that, then go to room_4 via grey_door_1. But that would take more steps. The current plan is 5 actions. Let's see:

Another possible path: Starting in room_2, unlock red_door_1 (connects to room_1), go to room_1, then unlock purple_door_1 (connects to room_3), go to room_3, then unlock grey_door_1 (connects to room_4). But that would require more steps.

But since the goal is to be in front of grey_door_1 (which connects room_3 and room_4) and have it unlocked, the shortest path is through room_4. So the initial plan seems optimal. So the steps are as above.

Wait, but after step 3 (gotoroom room_2 room_4 blue_door_1), the agent is in room_4, but not in front of anything. Then step 4 is gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3. Then step 5 is toggle. So the final state is the agent in front of grey_door_1, which is unlocked. That meets all the goal conditions.

So the plan would be those five actions. Let me check the preconditions:

1. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_4: agent is in room_2, which is connected via blue_door_1. No objects blocking (assuming yes). So valid.

2. toggle blue_door_1: agent is in front of blue_door_1. Valid.

3. gotoroom room_2 room_4 blue_door_1: door is now unlocked. Valid. Agent moves to room_4.

4. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3: agent is in room_4, which is connected via grey_door_1. No objects blocking. Valid.

5. toggle grey_door_1: agent is in front of it, unlocks it. Now door is unlocked, and agent is in front. So goal achieved.

Yes, this seems correct. So the optimal plan is these five steps.
