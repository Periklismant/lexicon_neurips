Okay, let me try to work through this planning problem step by step. So the goal is to have a purple box in room_1, be in room_1, and be in front of that box. The initial state is that the agent is in room_2, and there are various objects in different rooms. All doors are initially locked. The constraints here might be the actions we can take and the preconditions for each action.

First, I need to find the purple box. Looking at the initial state, the purple_box_1 is in room_1. So that's good because the goal requires a purple box in room_1. Wait, the goal says there must be a purple box in room_1, and the agent must be in front of it in room_1. So the purple_box_1 is already in room_1. So the main challenges are getting to room_1, unlocking the necessary doors, and positioning in front of the purple box.

But the agent starts in room_2. To get from room_2 to room_1, there's the red_door_1 connecting them. However, the red_door_1 is locked. So the agent needs to unlock it. But to unlock a door, the agent has to be in front of it and then toggle it. So first, the agent needs to go to the red_door_1 in room_2, then toggle it to unlock.

But wait, the preconditions for gotodoor: you can go in front of a door d if you are in a room connected by d, and there's no object blocking the position in front of d. Are there any objects blocking doors in room_2? Let's check the initial state. The objects in room_1 are blue_ball_1, purple_box_1, red_ball_1. Room_2's objects aren't mentioned except the agent is there. So in room_2, the doors are red_door_1 (connecting to room_1) and yellow_door_1 (connecting to room_4). Are there any objects blocking in front of these doors in room_2? The initial state doesn't mention any objects in room_2 except maybe the agent. So perhaps the doors are not blocked. So the agent can go to red_door_1 in room_2.

So the steps would be:

1. Go to red_door_1 in room_2 (using gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_1)
2. Toggle red_door_1 to unlock it.
3. Then go through the door from room_2 to room_1 using gotoroom room_2 room_1 red_door_1.

Once in room_1, the agent needs to go to the purple_box_1. But to do that, the agent needs to be in front of it. Since the purple_box_1 is in room_1, after entering room_1, the agent can use gotoobject purple_box_1 room_1.

Wait, but after entering the room via gotoroom, the agent is no longer in front of anything. So after entering room_1, the agent is in the room but not in front of any object. Then they can perform gotoobject purple_box_1 room_1.

But wait, the preconditions for gotoobject are that the agent is in the same room as the object. Since purple_box_1 is in room_1, and the agent is in room_1 after step 3, that's okay.

So the plan steps would be:

1. gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_1
2. toggle red_door_1
3. gotoroom room_2 room_1 red_door_1
4. gotoobject purple_box_1 room_1

But wait, the initial state says that all doors are locked. So red_door_1 is locked. So step 1: gotodoor red_door_1 in room_2. Then toggle to unlock. Then gotoroom to room_1. Then gotoobject purple_box_1.

But after step 3, the agent is in room_1. Then step 4 is to go in front of the purple box. Then the goal is satisfied: the agent is in room_1, in front of the purple box, which is in room_1.

So that's four actions. But let me check if there are any constraints I'm missing. The constraints mentioned in the problem are part of the planning problem's set of constraints. Wait, the user provided a problem with a set of constraints, but in the problem description, the constraints section under "A valid plan for the abovementioned problem must abide by the following constraints:" is empty. Wait, looking back, the user wrote:

"A valid plan for the abovementioned problem must abide by the following constraints:"

But then there's nothing listed. So perhaps there are no additional constraints beyond the preconditions of the actions. So the main thing is to follow the action preconditions and ensure the goal is met.

Wait, but maybe there's a mistake here. Let me recheck the original problem statement. The user provided the initial state, the goal, and then says there are constraints. But the constraints section is empty. So maybe it's a formatting error, but as per the given information, there are no additional constraints beyond the usual action preconditions.

So the plan as outlined should work. Let me check each step's preconditions.

Step 1: gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_1.

Preconditions: agent is in a room connected by red_door_1 (room_2 is connected to room_1 via red_door_1), and no object is blocking the position in front of the door in the current room (room_2). Since room_2's initial state doesn't list any objects except the agent, and the agent's position isn't specified as blocking, this should be okay.

Step 2: toggle red_door_1. Precondition: agent is in front of red_door_1. After step 1, the agent is in front of red_door_1, so this is okay.

Step 3: gotoroom room_2 room_1 red_door_1. Preconditions: agent is in room_2 (which they are), adjacent to room_1 (connected via red_door_1), and the door is unlocked. After step 2, the door is unlocked, so this is okay.

Step 4: gotoobject purple_box_1 room_1. Precondition: agent is in room_1, which they are after step 3. Also, the purple_box_1 is in room_1. So this is okay.

So the plan should be:

gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_1
toggle red_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_1 red_door_1
gotoobject purple_box_1 room_1

But let me check if after step 3, when the agent enters room_1, are they in front of anything? The effect of gotoroom is that if they were in front of something, they are no longer. But after step 3, they were in front of red_door_1 in room_2, but after moving to room_1, they are not in front of anything. So they need to go to the purple_box_1 in room_1. So step 4 is needed.

This seems to meet the goal: the agent is in room_1, in front of the purple box (which is in room_1). So that should satisfy the goal.

But wait, the goal says "There is a box v such that... v is purple, in room_1, you are in room_1, and you are in front of v." Since purple_box_1 is already in room_1, the only thing needed is to be in room_1 and in front of it. So this plan works.

Is there a shorter plan? Let's see. The steps are four actions. Is there a way to do it in fewer steps?

Alternative approach: Maybe the agent can go from room_2 to another room and use a different door? But the only door connecting room_2 to another room is red_door_1 (to room_1) and yellow_door_1 (to room_4). The yellow_door_1 is locked, so they would need to unlock it, but that's more steps. So the original plan is better.

Another check: When the agent is in room_1 after step 3, are there any objects blocking the purple_box_1? The initial state says purple_box_1 is in room_1, along with blue_ball_1 and red_ball_1. But the agent can still go to the purple_box_1 as long as they are in the same room. The gotoobject action just requires that the object is in the same room and that the agent is not blocked from moving to it. The problem statement doesn't mention any blocking by other objects unless they are in front of doors. So the gotoobject should work.

Therefore, the plan is valid and optimal with four steps.
