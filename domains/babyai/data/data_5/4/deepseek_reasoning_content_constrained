Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. Hmm. So the goal is to have a purple box in room_1, with me in front of it in room_1. The initial state has purple_box_1 already in room_1. Wait, so maybe I just need to get to room_1 and be in front of it? But there are constraints to consider.

First, the constraints. Let's list them out:

1. At some state, I must be holding an object.
2. At some state, yellow_door_1 must be unlocked.
3. Red_door_1 must always be locked (so never unlock it).
4. At some state, I must be in room_2.
5. If I'm in room_2 in any state, then either I'm holding purple_box_1 or blue_box_1 is in room_2 at that state or after.

The initial state: I'm in room_2. All doors are locked. The purple_box_1 is in room_1. The red_door connects room_1 and room_2. But since red_door is locked, I can't go directly from room_2 to room_1 via red_door. So I need another path.

Wait, the doors: room_2 is connected to room_4 via yellow_door_1, which is locked. Room_4 is connected to room_3 via purple_door_1, which is locked. Room_3 is connected to room_1 via grey_door_1, locked. So all doors are locked. To move between rooms, I need to unlock doors. But the toggle action requires being in front of the door. To get in front of a door, I need to be in the room that the door connects, and the door's position isn't blocked.

But doors are blocked by objects? Wait, the precondition for "gotodoor" is that there's no object blocking the position in front of the door in the current room. So I need to check if any doors are blocked. Let's look at the initial state. The objects in each room:

room_1 has blue_ball_1, purple_box_1, red_ball_1. So if those objects are in front of doors, they would block. But I don't have info on their positions. The problem says that the agent can "gotoobject x r" if in the same room. So maybe the doors aren't blocked by objects unless specified. The initial state doesn't mention any objects blocking doors, so I assume that doors are not blocked. So I can go to the doors.

So the plan would involve unlocking doors to move between rooms. But I need to be careful with the constraints.

Let's start. I'm in room_2. The red_door_1 is locked (and must stay locked always). So I can't use that door. So the only other door from room_2 is yellow_door_1 leading to room_4. But yellow_door_1 is locked. To unlock it, I need to toggle it. So first, go to yellow_door_1 from room_2, then toggle it.

But to go to the door, I need to do "gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_4". But wait, the action is "gotodoor d r1 r2" where d is the door, and r1 and r2 are the rooms it connects. So in room_2, yellow_door_1 connects room_2 and room_4, so I can do "gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_4". Then toggle it. That would unlock it, satisfying constraint 2 (since yellow_door_1 is now unlocked). Then I can go to room_4 via yellow_door_1.

Once in room_4, the next door is purple_door_1 to room_3. But it's locked. So go to purple_door_1 in room_4, toggle it. Then go to room_3. Now, in room_3, there's grey_door_1 connecting to room_1. But it's locked. So goto grey_door_1 in room_3, toggle it, unlock. Then go to room_1. Once in room_1, go to the purple_box_1 (which is there) and be in front of it.

But wait, the goal is to be in front of a purple box in room_1. The purple_box_1 is already in room_1. So once I reach room_1, I need to do "gotoobject purple_box_1 room_1", then I'm in front of it, and the goal is achieved.

But let's check the constraints:

1. Must hold an object at some point. When? Maybe pick up an object along the way. Let's see: during the journey, perhaps pick up the green_ball_1 in room_4, which is on the way. Because when I go through room_4 to room_3, maybe I can pick up green_ball_1. But wait, the green_ball_1 is in room_4. Let me check the initial state: yes, green_ball_1 is in room_4. So when in room_4, after unlocking the purple_door_1, I can go to the green_ball_1, pick it up. Then drop it somewhere else. But why? Because constraint 1 requires that at some point I'm holding an object. So I need to have that action in the plan.

Also, constraint 5: whenever I'm in room_2 (which is initially the case), I need to have either hold purple_box_1 or have blue_box_1 in room_2. But the initial state has me in room_2. So in the first state (s0), I'm in room_2. But the constraint says that if I'm in room_2 in any state s, then either in s or a subsequent state, I must be holding purple_box_1 or blue_box_1 is in room_2. So in the initial state, since I'm in room_2, I need to ensure that either in s0 or after, I hold purple_box_1 or blue_box_1 is in room_2.

But in the initial state, I'm not holding anything, and blue_box_1 is in room_3. So I need to either bring blue_box_1 to room_2 at some point or hold purple_box_1. However, purple_box_1 is in room_1. So how can I hold it? To get purple_box_1, I need to go to room_1, pick it up, but room_1 is connected via red_door (locked, can't use) or via grey_door_1 from room_3. So after unlocking grey_door_1, go to room_1, pick up purple_box_1, then maybe return to room_2. But that's a long path. Alternatively, maybe bring blue_box_1 from room_3 to room_2. Let's think.

Alternatively, perhaps after getting to room_3, pick up blue_box_1, carry it back to room_2. Let's see:

From room_3, you can go back to room_4 via purple_door_1 (if it's unlocked), then to room_2 via yellow_door_1. But blue_box_1 is in room_3. So pick it up in room_3, carry it through room_4 to room_2. Then drop it in room_2. That would satisfy constraint 5 whenever I'm in room_2 again. For example, if after dropping blue_box_1 in room_2, any time I go back to room_2, the blue_box_1 is there, so the constraint holds.

But the initial state has me in room_2, and the plan needs to handle that. So in the initial state, the constraint is triggered because I'm in room_2. Therefore, I must either have blue_box_1 in room_2 or be holding purple_box_1 either in s0 or later. Since in s0, blue_box_1 is not in room_2 and I'm not holding anything, I need to ensure that in a subsequent state, blue_box_1 is moved to room_2. But how?

Wait, the initial state has me in room_2. So in the first state, the constraint applies. Therefore, in the plan, either in the first action, I pick up something (but I can't, since I'm in room_2 and there's no objects there) or I move blue_box_1 to room_2 at some point. But blue_box_1 is in room_3. So I need to bring it to room_2.

So the steps would be:

1. From room_2, unlock yellow_door_1 (go to door, toggle), then go to room_4.

2. From room_4, unlock purple_door_1, go to room_3.

3. In room_3, unlock grey_door_1 (connects to room_1), but perhaps first pick up blue_box_1, then take it back through room_4 to room_2.

Wait, but the goal is to be in room_1 in front of purple_box_1. So maybe the plan is to go to room_1 via room_3, then do the necessary. But also need to bring blue_box_1 to room_2.

Alternatively, maybe after going to room_3, pick up blue_box_1, carry it to room_4, then to room_2. Then proceed to room_1.

But this would take more steps. Let me outline the possible steps:

Initial state: room_2, all doors locked.

Action 1: gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_4

Action 2: toggle yellow_door_1 (now unlocked, satisfying constraint 2)

Action 3: gotoroom room_2 room_4 yellow_door_1 (now in room_4)

Action 4: gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_3

Action 5: toggle purple_door_1

Action 6: gotoroom room_4 room_3 purple_door_1 (now in room_3)

In room_3, blue_box_1 is present.

Action 7: gotoobject blue_box_1 room_3

Action 8: pick blue_box_1 room_3 (now holding it, satisfying constraint 1)

Now, need to take blue_box_1 to room_2.

Action 9: gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_4

Action 10: gotoroom room_3 room_4 purple_door_1 (back to room_4)

Action 11: gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_4 room_2

Action 12: gotoroom room_4 room_2 yellow_door_1 (now in room_2)

Action 13: drop blue_box_1 room_2 (now blue_box_1 is in room_2, satisfying constraint 5 whenever we are in room_2 again)

Now, since we are in room_2 again, the constraint is satisfied because blue_box_1 is there.

Now, need to get to room_1. But red_door_1 is locked and cannot be unlocked (constraint 3 says red_door_1 must always be locked). So the only path is through grey_door_1 from room_3.

But currently in room_2. So need to go back to room_4, then room_3, unlock grey_door_1, then go to room_1.

But let's proceed:

Action 14: gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_4

Action 15: gotoroom room_2 room_4 yellow_door_1 (back to room_4)

Action 16: gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_3

Action 17: gotoroom room_4 room_3 purple_door_1 (room_3 again)

Now, in room_3, unlock grey_door_1.

Action 18: gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1

Action 19: toggle grey_door_1 (unlocks it)

Action 20: gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1 (now in room_1)

In room_1, purple_box_1 is present.

Action 21: gotoobject purple_box_1 room_1

Now, the goal is achieved: in room_1, in front of purple_box_1.

But need to check constraints:

- Constraint 1: Holding an object at some point. Yes, when we picked up blue_box_1.

- Constraint 2: yellow_door_1 was unlocked (actions 2 and 3).

- Constraint 3: red_door_1 remained locked throughout.

- Constraint 4: At some state, in room_2. We were initially there, and later returned (action 12).

- Constraint 5: Whenever in room_2 (initially and after action 12), blue_box_1 was placed there (action 13), so subsequent visits are okay.

But wait, when we first start in room_2, the constraint requires that either we hold purple_box_1 or blue_box_1 is in room_2 at that state or after. In the initial state, blue_box_1 is in room_3, so the first time in room_2 (s0), we need to ensure that eventually blue_box_1 is in room_2. Which we did by action 13. So the plan satisfies that.

But is this the shortest path? Let me count the steps. 21 actions. Maybe there's a shorter path.

Alternative approach: After unlocking yellow_door_1 and purple_door_1, go to room_3, unlock grey_door_1, go to room_1, and then bring purple_box_1 to room_2. But then I'd have to pick up purple_box_1 in room_1, which would require being in room_1. But then, to get back to room_2, I need to use the grey_door_1 (unlocked) to room_3, then through purple_door_1 (unlocked) to room_4, then through yellow_door_1 (unlocked) to room_2. Then drop purple_box_1 in room_2, which would satisfy constraint 5. But then I need to go back to room_1 again for the goal. That might take more steps.

Alternatively, perhaps after bringing blue_box_1 to room_2, then proceed to room_1 via grey_door_1. Let's see:

But in the initial plan, after dropping blue_box_1 in room_2, we go back through room_4 and room_3 to room_1. Maybe there's a way to optimize.

Wait, after dropping blue_box_1 in room_2 (action 13), perhaps we can proceed directly to unlock grey_door_1 and go to room_1. But how?

Wait, after action 13, we're in room_2. From room_2, the doors are red_door_1 (locked) and yellow_door_1 (unlocked). So to get to room_4, we can go via yellow_door_1 again. Then to room_3 via purple_door_1. Then unlock grey_door_1, go to room_1.

But that's the same path as before. So perhaps the initial plan is the shortest.

But maybe there's a smarter way. Let's think: Do I need to bring blue_box_1 to room_2? Yes, to satisfy constraint 5. Because whenever I'm in room_2 (including the initial state), blue_box_1 must be there eventually. So the earliest possible time to satisfy that is by moving blue_box_1 to room_2 as soon as possible.

Alternatively, could I pick up the green_ball_1 in room_4 when passing through, satisfying the "hold object" constraint, then proceed to room_3, unlock grey_door_1, and go to room_1. Then drop the green_ball_1 there. But this way, the constraint of holding an object is satisfied. Then, since in room_2 initially, we need to ensure that blue_box_1 is in room_2 at some point. But maybe it's not necessary if I can hold purple_box_1 while in room_2. But how?

Wait, purple_box_1 is in room_1. To hold it, I need to go to room_1, pick it up, and bring it back to room_2. But that would require passing through grey_door_1, which connects room_3 and room_1, and then room_3 to room_4, room_4 to room_2. So after picking up purple_box_1 in room_1, bring it back to room_2. Then drop it there. That would satisfy constraint 5, since whenever I'm in room_2, I have purple_box_1 either held or dropped. But that might take more steps than moving blue_box_1.

But moving blue_box_1 from room_3 to room_2 requires:

room_3 → room_4 → room_2. So:

From room_3, pick blue_box_1, take to room_4, then to room_2, drop. Then proceed to room_1 via room_3.

This seems necessary. So perhaps the initial plan is the shortest.

Now, let's check if all actions are necessary.

Another thought: After unlocking grey_door_1, can I go directly to room_1, pick up purple_box_1, then return to room_2 via the same path, drop it there, then go back to room_1 for the goal. But that would add more steps, but maybe satisfies constraint 5.

But moving purple_box_1 to room_2 would require:

After picking it up in room_1, go back to room_3, then room_4, then room_2. Drop it in room_2. Then go back to room_1 again. That's more steps than moving blue_box_1. So the initial approach is better.

Thus, the plan is:

Unlock yellow_door_1 (room_2 to room_4), unlock purple_door_1 (room_4 to room_3), go to room_3, pick up blue_box_1, take it back to room_2, drop it. Then go back to room_3, unlock grey_door_1, go to room_1, and be in front of purple_box_1.

This satisfies all constraints.

Now, the exact sequence of actions:

1. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_4

2. toggle yellow_door_1 (now unlocked)

3. gotoroom room_2 room_4 yellow_door_1 (now in room4)

4. gotodoor purple_door_1 room4 room3

5. toggle purple_door_1 (unlocks)

6. gotoroom room4 room3 purple_door_1 (now in room3)

7. gotoobject blue_box_1 room3

8. pick blue_box_1 room3 (now holding)

9. gotodoor purple_door_1 room3 room4

10. gotoroom room3 room4 purple_door_1 (room4)

11. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room4 room2

12. gotoroom room4 room2 yellow_door_1 (room2)

13. drop blue_box_1 room2 (now blue_box_1 in room2, satisfies constraint5)

14. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room2 room4

15. gotoroom room2 room4 yellow_door_1 (room4)

16. gotodoor purple_door_1 room4 room3

17. gotoroom room4 room3 purple_door_1 (room3)

18. gotodoor grey_door_1 room3 room1

19. toggle grey_door_1 (unlocks)

20. gotoroom room3 room1 grey_door_1 (now in room1)

21. gotoobject purple_box_1 room1

Now, check if all constraints are met:

- Constraint1: Held blue_box_1 (action8), yes.

- Constraint2: yellow_door_1 unlocked (action2), yes.

- Constraint3: red_door_1 remains locked throughout, yes.

- Constraint4: Been in room_2 (initially and actions3,12, etc.), yes.

- Constraint5: In room_2 (initial state and after action12), blue_box_1 is there (action13), so yes.

The goal is achieved in action21: in room1, in front of purple_box_1.

But wait, after action20, you're in room1. Then action21 is gotoobject purple_box_1 room1, which makes you in front of it. That satisfies the goal.

Is there a shorter way? Let's see:

After dropping blue_box_1 in room2 (action13), can I avoid going back to room4 and 3 again? For example, from room2, can I go to room4, then room3, then room1 via grey_door_1. That's the same path as in the current plan.

Alternative approach: Maybe after dropping blue_box_1 in room2, go to room4, then room3, unlock grey_door_1, go to room1. That's steps 14-20.

Alternatively, can I combine steps? For example, after action13 (drop blue_box_1), go to room4, then to room3, unlock grey_door_1, go to room1. That's necessary steps.

Alternatively, is there a way to avoid going back and forth? Maybe not, since the path requires going through the doors.

Alternatively, after action13, could I use a different path? Unlikely, since red_door_1 is locked and must remain so.

Thus, the current plan seems optimal.

But let's count the steps: 21 actions. Is there a way to reduce that?

Wait, after action6 (in room3), you pick blue_box_1 (action7-8). Then go back to room2 (actions9-12). Then back to room3 (actions14-17). Maybe there's a way to combine some steps. For example, after action6, when in room3, can we unlock grey_door_1 first before taking blue_box_1 to room2? But then, to unlock grey_door_1, need to go to it and toggle. So:

Alternative sequence:

After action6 (in room3):

7. gotodoor grey_door_1 room3 room1

8. toggle grey_door_1 (unlock)

9. gotoobject blue_box_1 room3

10. pick blue_box_1 room3

Then take it to room2 via room4.

But then, after unlocking grey_door_1, you could proceed directly to room1 later. But does this save steps? Let's see:

Original plan steps 7-21: 15 steps.

Alternative approach:

In room3, unlock grey_door_1 first:

Actions after action6 (in room3):

7. gotodoor grey_door_1 room3 room1

8. toggle grey_door_1 (unlocked)

9. gotoobject blue_box_1 room3

10. pick blue_box_1 room3

Then proceed to room2:

11. gotodoor purple_door_1 room3 room4

12. gotoroom room3 room4 purple_door_1 (room4)

13. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room4 room2

14. gotoroom room4 room2 yellow_door_1 (room2)

15. drop blue_box_1 room2

Now, from room2, need to get back to room1:

16. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room2 room4

17. gotoroom room2 room4 yellow_door_1 (room4)

18. gotodoor purple_door_1 room4 room3

19. gotoroom room4 room3 purple_door_1 (room3)

20. gotoroom room3 room1 grey_door_1 (already unlocked)

21. gotoobject purple_box_1 room1

This is 21 steps as well. No change in count.

Another idea: After dropping blue_box_1 in room2, instead of going back through room4 and room3, can we go directly from room2 to room1 via red_door_1? But red_door_1 is locked and must remain locked. So no.

Thus, the initial plan is optimal.

Now, checking if all actions are valid:

- All gotodoor and gotoroom steps use the correct doors and rooms.

- When toggling, the agent is in front of the door.

- When picking up blue_box_1, the agent is in room3, in front of it.

- When dropping, in room2, front is empty (since after dropping, you are in front of it).

Thus, the plan is valid.
