Alright, let's break down this planning problem:

We're in a 2D gridworld with 4 rooms arranged in a square:
- room_1 (north-west)
- room_2 (south-west)
- room_3 (north-east)
- room_4 (south-east)

There are 4 doors connecting the following room pairs:
- green_door_1: room_1-room_2
- yellow_door_1: room_1-room_3
- red_door_1: room_2-room_4
- purple_door_1: room_3-room_4

Initially, all doors are locked, and we start in room_4. We also have various boxes and balls in different rooms.

The goal is to have "There is a door d such that "The following conditions are all true: "d is yellow", "room_3 and room_1 are connected via d", "you are in front of d", "d is not locked""".

So, we need to be in front of yellow_door_1, which should be unlocked, and it connects room_3 and room_1.

Constraints:
1. We must hold some object at some point.
2. We must never be in room_3.
3. purple_door_1 must always be locked.
4. We must be in front of yellow_door_1 at some point.
5. Before we are in front of yellow_door_1, we must have held some object.
6. We must be in front of purple_door_1 at some point.
7. Before we are in front of purple_door_1, we must either have been in room_1 or have held some object.

Now, let's think about a plan:

To meet the goal, we need to be in front of yellow_door_1, which should be unlocked, and it connects room_3 and room_1. This means we need to be in either room_3 or room_1 and facing yellow_door_1.

However, constraint 2 says we can never be in room_3. This means we must be in room_1 when we are in front of yellow_door_1.

To get to room_1, we need to go through at least one door. All doors are initially locked, so we need to unlock at least one door.

To unlock a door, we need to be in front of it and use the "toggle" action.

Let's think about which door we should unlock to get to room_1:
- From room_4, we can go to room_2 or room_3.
  - If we go to room_3, we'd be violating constraint 2.
  - So, we should go to room_2 by unlocking red_door_1.
- From room_2, we can go to room_1 by unlocking green_door_1.

Constraint 6 says we must be in front of purple_door_1 at some point. Since purple_door_1 connects room_3 and room_4, and we can't enter room_3 (constraint 2), we must go in front of purple_door_1 from room_4.

Constraint 7 says before we are in front of purple_door_1, we must either have been in room_1 or have held some object. Since we start in room_4 and might not have been to room_1 yet, we'll need to hold some object before going in front of purple_door_1.

Constraint 5 says before we are in front of yellow_door_1, we must have held some object. 

Constraint 1 says we must hold some object at some point, which aligns with the other constraints.

Hmm, there's a bit of a dependency here: We want to be in front of purple_door_1, but before that, we need to hold an object (or have been in room_1). Then we want to be in front of yellow_door_1, but before that, we need to have held an object.

Alright, here's a rough plan:
1. Pick up an object in room_4 (there are several available).
2. Go in front of purple_door_1 in room_4.
3. Drop the object in room_4.
4. Go in front of red_door_1 in room_4.
5. Toggle red_door_1 to unlock it.
6. Go to room_2 using red_door_1.
7. Go in front of green_door_1 in room_2.
8. Toggle green_door_1 to unlock it.
9. Go to room_1 using green_door_1.
10. Pick up another object in room_1 (if there are any).
11. Go in front of yellow_door_1 in room_1.
12. Toggle yellow_door_1 to unlock it.

This would satisfy the goal and all constraints.

Looking back, I've realized that "yellow_door_1" is the door that connects room_1 and room_3, and the goal is to be in front of this door when it's unlocked. Great, this means our plan is on the right track.

Let's refine the plan with specific actions:

1. From room_4, we'll first pick up an object, then go in front of purple_door_1, followed by going in front of red_door_1, toggling it, and going to room_2.
2. In room_2, we'll go in front of green_door_1, toggle it, and go to room_1.
3. In room_1, we'll go in front of yellow_door_1 and toggle it.

Let's see which objects we could pick up in room_4:
- red_box_2
- blue_ball_2
- green_ball_1

Any of these would work. Let's go with red_box_2 for now.

Actually, I think the plan I'm formulating has a problem. If we're in front of purple_door_1 in room_4, we'd need to go elsewhere in room_4 before we can go in front of red_door_1. Also, we'd need to drop the object before we can pick up a new one.

This is how the plan should really look like:
1. In room_4, go in front of red_box_2.
2. Pick up red_box_2.
3. Go in front of purple_door_1 in room_4.
4. Go to an empty position.
5. Drop red_box_2.
6. Go in front of red_door_1 in room_4.
7. Toggle red_door_1 to unlock it.
8. Go to room_2 using red_door_1.
9. In room_2, go in front of green_door_1.
10. Toggle green_door_1 to unlock it.
11. Go to room_1 using green_door_1.
12. In room_1, go in front of yellow_door_1.
13. Toggle yellow_door_1 to unlock it.

Looking at this plan, I realized I misunderstood something. I initially thought the goal was to be in room_1 in front of yellow_door_1. But the yellow_door_1 connects room_3 and room_1, and we need to be in front of it. If we can't be in room_3 (as per constraint 2), then we must be in room_1 when we're in front of yellow_door_1.

Let's double-check the goal: "There is a door d such that "The following conditions are all true: "d is yellow", "room_3 and room_1 are connected via d", "you are in front of d", "d is not locked""".

So, the door is yellow_door_1, and we need to be in front of it, and it should be unlocked. The door connects room_3 and room_1, so we must be in one of these rooms. Since we can't be in room_3 (constraint 2), we must be in room_1.

With this in mind, our plan is still valid.

But let me recheck, just to be sure. Here's how our plan satisfies all the constraints:

1. "You must hold some object at some point." - Satisfied when we pick up red_box_2 in room_4.
2. "You must never be in room_3." - Satisfied because we never go to room_3 in our plan.
3. "purple_door_1 must always be locked." - Satisfied because we never toggle purple_door_1.
4. "You must be in front of yellow_door_1 at some point." - Satisfied in step 12.
5. "Before you are in front of yellow_door_1, you must have held some object." - Satisfied because we hold red_box_2 in step 2, which is before step 12.
6. "You must be in front of purple_door_1 at some point." - Satisfied in step 3.
7. "Before you are in front of purple_door_1, you must either have been in room_1 or have held some object." - Satisfied because we hold red_box_2 in step 2, which is before step 3.

This looks like a valid plan to me. Let's translate it into the actions:

1. gotoobject red_box_2 room_4
2. pick red_box_2 room_4
3. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_3
4. gotoempty
5. drop red_box_2 room_4
6. gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2
7. toggle red_door_1
8. gotoroom room_4 room_2 red_door_1
9. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_1
10. toggle green_door_1
11. gotoroom room_2 room_1 green_door_1
12. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3
13. toggle yellow_door_1

But wait, I just realized a potential problem. After we go in front of purple_door_1, we'd need to do gotoempty to move to an empty position. But I'm not sure if this action will put us in the same room. Let's check the action descriptions:

"goto empty": After performing this action, (i) if you were in front of some object or door x0, then you are no longer in front of x0 and (ii) you are in front of an empty position.

It doesn't mention anything about changing rooms, which suggests we stay in the same room. This seems reasonable, as "goto empty" should be a local action.

Another thing I noticed is that we're using red_box_2 in our plan, but it's a bit arbitrary. We could use any of the objects in room_4, such as blue_ball_2 or green_ball_1, and the plan would still be valid.

Let's double-check the initial state to make sure red_box_2 is in room_4:
"red_box_2 is in room_4" - Yes, this confirms it.

I believe our plan is still valid. In fact, I think it's optimal, as we've used the minimum number of actions to achieve the goal while respecting all constraints.

Actually, let me check the action descriptions again to understand the "gotodoor" action better. This action is important when we go in front of purple_door_1.

"goto door": you may only go in front of a door d if (i) you are in a room which door d is connecting with another room, and (ii) there is no object blocking the position in front of d in the room you are currently in.

So, to go in front of a door, we need to be in one of the rooms that the door connects. Also, there should be no object blocking the position in front of the door.

In our plan, we want to go in front of purple_door_1 in room_4. purple_door_1 connects room_3 and room_4, so we're good on the first condition. I don't see anything in the initial state about an object blocking purple_door_1, so we should be good on the second condition as well.

Similarly, for red_door_1, it connects room_2 and room_4, and we're in room_4 in step 6, so this should be valid.

For green_door_1, it connects room_1 and room_2, and we're in room_2 in step 9, so this is valid.

For yellow_door_1, it connects room_1 and room_3, and we're in room_1 in step 12, so this is valid.

Hmm, let me think if there's a shorter plan that still satisfies all constraints.

Actually, is there a way to avoid going to room_1? Initially, I thought we had to go to room_1 as part of the goal.

Let's revisit the goal: "There is a door d such that "The following conditions are all true: "d is yellow", "room_3 and room_1 are connected via d", "you are in front of d", "d is not locked"""

The door is yellow_door_1, it connects room_3 and room_1, we need to be in front of it, and it should be unlocked. If we're "in front of" a door, that means we're in one of the two rooms it connects.

So, to be in front of yellow_door_1, we must be in either room_3 or room_1. But constraint 2 says "you are not in room_3," so we must be in room_1.

So, we indeed need to go to room_1, and the plan I provided should be valid.

Let's double-check if the plan satisfies the goal:
- "d is yellow": yellow_door_1 is yellow (from the initial state).
- "room_3 and room_1 are connected via d": yellow_door_1 connects room_3 and room_1 (from the initial state).
- "you are in front of d": In step 12, we go in front of yellow_door_1.
- "d is not locked": In step 13, we toggle yellow_door_1 to unlock it (it was initially locked, so toggling would unlock it).

Yes, our plan meets the goal.

Actually, looking at our plan again, I realized an issue that is unclear to me: if we go in front of yellow_door_1 in room_1, will we toggle yellow_door_1 while we're in room_1? I mean, to unlock a door, do we need to be in a specific room?

Let's check the action descriptions: "toggle: you may only toggle a door d if you are in front of d."

It doesn't specify which room we need to be in, only that we need to be in front of the door. Since we're in front of yellow_door_1 in room_1, we should be able to toggle it.

Let's see if our toggle satisfies constraint 3: "purple_door_1 must always be locked." We never toggle purple_door_1 in our plan, so this constraint is satisfied.

I'm also wondering if we can omit the steps of picking up and dropping red_box_2. Let's revisit constraints 1, 5, and 7:

1. "You must hold some object at some point." - If we don't pick up red_box_2, this constraint would be violated.
5. "Before you are in front of yellow_door_1, you must have held some object." - If we don't pick up red_box_2, this constraint would be violated.
7. "Before you are in front of purple_door_1, you must either have been in room_1 or have held some object." - If we don't pick up red_box_2 and we haven't been to room_1 yet, this constraint would be violated.

So, we must include the steps of picking up an object before we go in front of purple_door_1.

I believe our plan is still valid and optimal.

One slight optimization I'm thinking of: we drop the object in step 5, but that's not strictly required by any of the constraints. We could potentially hold onto the object throughout the plan. This would mean we don't need steps 4 (going to an empty position) and 5 (dropping the object). But then again, the problem statement doesn't say we must have empty hands during the plan, so holding onto the object may not be an issue.

Let's reevaluate the preconditions for the actions in our plan to see if this optimization is valid. 

When we want to toggle red_door_1 in step 7, the precondition for the "toggle" action is: "You may only toggle a door d if you are in front of d."

It doesn't say we need to have empty hands, so we should be able to toggle while holding an object.

When we want to go to room_2 using red_door_1 in step 8, the precondition for the "goto room" action is: "You may only go in a room r if (i) you are currently in a room r0 that is adjacent to r, and (ii) the door that is connecting r0 and r is unlocked."

There's nothing here about having empty hands, so we should be able to go to a room while holding an object.

On to step 9, going in front of green_door_1 in room_2, the precondition is: "You may only go in front of a door d if (i) you are in a room which door d is connecting with another room, and (ii) there is no object blocking the position in front of d in the room you are currently in."

Again, no hands restriction, so we should be able to go in front of a door while holding an object.

For the toggle in step 10 and the goto room in step 11, similar to the earlier actions, there's no restriction on having empty hands.

Finally, for the goto door in step 12 and the toggle in step 13, there are also no restrictions on having empty hands.

It seems like we can eliminate steps 4 and 5 and still have a valid plan. Let's redo it:

1. gotoobject red_box_2 room_4
2. pick red_box_2 room_4
3. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_3
4. gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2
5. toggle red_door_1
6. gotoroom room_4 room_2 red_door_1
7. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_1
8. toggle green_door_1
9. gotoroom room_2 room_1 green_door_1
10. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3
11. toggle yellow_door_1

That should be more optimal.

Actually, let me double check one more time: if we're holding red_box_2, are we still allowed to toggle a door?

"toggle": you may only toggle a door d if you are in front of d.

It doesn't say we can't hold an object while toggling a door. Great, that means our optimized plan is still valid.

Actually, I realized another potential optimization: from room_4, I'm not sure if we need to first go in front of red_box_2 and then pick it up. Let me check the precondition:

"pick": you may only pick up an object x if (i) you are in the same room as x, and (ii) you are currently not holding any object.

Ah, it doesn't explicitly say we need to be in front of the object to pick it up. But maybe the default assumption is that we need to be in front of an object to interact with it? Let's check the action description again:

"goto object": After performing this action regarding an object x, (i) if you were in front of some object or door x0, then you are no longer in front of x0 and (ii) you are in front of object x.

Ok, so "goto object" is how we position ourselves in front of an object. Now let's check the full description for "pick":

"pick": you may only pick up an object x if (i) you are in the same room as x, and (ii) you are currently not holding any object.

"pick": After performing this action regarding an object x, (i) you are no longer in front of x, (ii) your hands are no longer empty, (iii) you are carrying x, (iv) x is no longer in the room, and (v) if x was blocking some door, then it is no longer blocking that door.

Looking at the effects, it says we are "no longer in front of x" after picking it up, which implies that we need to be "in front of x" before picking it up. This confirms my understanding that we need "goto object" before we can pick up an object.

Ok, let me restate the plan to make sure it's both valid and optimal:

1. gotoobject red_box_2 room_4
2. pick red_box_2 room_4
3. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_3
4. gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2
5. toggle red_door_1
6. gotoroom room_4 room_2 red_door_1
7. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_1
8. toggle green_door_1
9. gotoroom room_2 room_1 green_door_1
10. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3
11. toggle yellow_door_1

In the end, we're in room_1, in front of yellow_door_1, and yellow_door_1 is unlocked. This satisfies our goal.

Actually, I haven't checked one thing: let's make sure that after our plan, purple_door_1 remains locked. In our plan, we don't interact with purple_door_1 after step 3, and we never toggle it. So, purple_door_1 will remain locked throughout the plan. Constraint 3 says "purple_door_1 is locked," which is satisfied.

I believe our plan is both valid and optimal.

Actually, let me double check one thing: if we need to go to another door in the same room, do we first need to gotoempty and then go to the door? or can we directly go to the other door? Let's see the description:

"goto door": After performing this action regarding a door d, (i) if you were in front of some object or door x0, then you are no longer in front of x0 and (ii) you are in front of door d.

This suggests that we can go from one door to another door directly using the "goto door" action, without needing to go to an empty position first.

But wait, I need to check our precondition. If we're in front of purple_door_1 in room_4, can we directly go to red_door_1?

"goto door": you may only go in front of a door d if (i) you are in a room which door d is connecting with another room, and (ii) there is no object blocking the position in front of d in the room you are currently in.

Yes, it looks like we can directly go to red_door_1 from purple_door_1, since we're still in room_4, and red_door_1 connects room_4 with room_2. There's no indication of any object blocking the doors, so we should be good. Our plan stands as is.

Final plan:
1. gotoobject red_box_2 room_4
2. pick red_box_2 room_4
3. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_3
4. gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2
5. toggle red_door_1
6. gotoroom room_4 room_2 red_door_1
7. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_1
8. toggle green_door_1
9. gotoroom room_2 room_1 green_door_1
10. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3
11. toggle yellow_door_1

This is 11 steps, and I believe it's the optimal plan. Here's the double check:

1. We're in room_4, we go in front of red_box_2.
2. We pick up red_box_2.
3. While holding red_box_2, we go to purple_door_1 in room_4. This satisfies constraint 7 (before we're in front of purple_door_1, we must either be in room_1 or holding an object).
4. We go to red_door_1 in room_4.
5. We toggle red_door_1, unlocking it.
6. We go to room_2 via red_door_1. Room_2 is adjacent to room_4, and the connecting door is now unlocked.
7. In room_2, we go to green_door_1.
8. We toggle green_door_1, unlocking it.
9. We go to room_1 via green_door_1. Room_1 is adjacent to room_2, and the connecting door is now unlocked.
10. In room_1, we go to yellow_door_1. This satisfies constraint 5 (before we're in front of yellow_door_1, we must have held an object). We've held red_box_2 since step 2.
11. We toggle yellow_door_1, unlocking it. Now yellow_door_1 is unlocked, which was one of the conditions for the goal.

After step 11, we're in room_1, in front of yellow_door_1, and yellow_door_1 is unlocked. We've satisfied all 4 conditions of the goal.

Constraint 1 says we must hold some object at some point, which we fulfilled by picking up red_box_2 in step 2.
Constraint 2 says we must never be in room_3, which we respected throughout the plan. We're always in either room_4, room_2, or room_1.
Constraint 3 says purple_door_1 must always be locked, which we respected by never toggling purple_door_1.
Constraint 4 says we must be in front of yellow_door_1 at some point, which we fulfilled in step 10.
Constraint 5 says before we're in front of yellow_door_1, we must have held some object, which we fulfilled by picking up red_box_2 in step 2.
Constraint 6 says we must be in front of purple_door_1 at some point, which we fulfilled in step 3.
Constraint 7 says before we're in front of purple_door_1, we must either have been in room_1 or have held some object, which we fulfilled by picking up red_box_2 in step 2.

So, our plan is valid and satisfies all constraints. It seems optimal to me, as every action is essential to achieve the goal while respecting the constraints.

Actually, I want to check one thing. The problem statement says we need to provide an optimal plan, which is "a valid plan whose length is equal or less than the length of any other valid plan." Since we understand the domain, we can reason about the optimality analytically. 

A crucial step in our plan is to go from room_4 to room_1, since that's where we need to be to unlock yellow_door_1. To do this, we need to take at least 2 steps:
1. Unlock and go through red_door_1 from room_4 to room_2.
2. Unlock and go through green_door_1 from room_2 to room_1.

Each of these steps requires going to the door, toggling the door, and then going through the door, which are 3 actions per step, for a total of 6 actions. 

Additionally, we need to satisfy several constraints:
1. We need to pick up an object, which requires going to the object and picking it up, which are 2 actions.
2. We need to go in front of purple_door_1, which is 1 action.
3. After reaching room_1, we need to go in front of yellow_door_1 and unlock it, which are 2 actions.

In total, that's 6 + 2 + 1 + 2 = 11 actions, which matches the length of our plan. So, our plan is indeed optimal.

Actually, let me think about this analytically again.

1. We need to pick up an object. (2 step: goto, pick)
2. We need to be in front of purple_door_1. (1 step)
3. We need to reach room_1. (4 steps: goto door, toggle, goto door, toggle, goto room)
4. We need to be in front of yellow_door_1 and unlock it. (2 steps: goto door, toggle)

Hmm, but that's 9 steps. 

Oh, I've realized what step I've miscounted. Let me re-count:
1. We need to pick up an object. (2 steps: goto, pick)
2. We need to be in front of purple_door_1. (1 step)
3. We need to reach room_1. (6 steps: goto door, toggle, goto room, goto door, toggle, goto room)
4. We need to be in front of yellow_door_1 and unlock it. (2 steps: goto door, toggle)

That's 2 + 1 + 6 + 2 = 11 steps, which matches our plan. I think our plan is optimal.

I've satisfied myself analytically that our 11-step plan is optimal.

I'm ready to commit to my final answer. The optimal plan is:

1. gotoobject red_box_2 room_4
2. pick red_box_2 room_4
3. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_3
4. gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2
5. toggle red_door_1
6. gotoroom room_4 room_2 red_door_1
7. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_1
8. toggle green_door_1
9. gotoroom room_2 room_1 green_door_1
10. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3
11. toggle yellow_door_1

I've confirmed that this plan is valid and meets all constraints, and I've convinced myself analytically that it's optimal.

Actually, hold on. Let me double-check something. The precondition for the "goto room" action is:
"goto room": you may only go in a room r if (i) you are currently in a room r0 that is adjacent to r, and (ii) the door that is connecting r0 and r is unlocked.

So in step 6, we go from room_4 to room_2 using red_door_1, which we just unlocked in step 5. This is valid.

In step 9, we go from room_2 to room_1 using green_door_1, which we just unlocked in step 8. This is also valid.

Perfect, our plan is valid and I'm confident it's optimal.
