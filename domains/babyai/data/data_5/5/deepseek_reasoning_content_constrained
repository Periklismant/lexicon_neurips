Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. The goal is to get to a yellow door that connects room_3 and room_1, be in front of it, and have it unlocked. But there are a bunch of constraints to satisfy. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the initial state: the agent is in room_4. All doors are locked. The doors are green_door_1 (connecting room_1 and 2), yellow_door_1 (room_1 and 3), red_door_1 (room_2 and 4), and purple_door_1 (room_3 and 4). The goal door must be yellow, connect room_1 and 3, so that's yellow_door_1. We need to be in front of it, and it must be unlocked. But the constraints say we can never enter room_3, so how do we handle that? Also, purple_door_1 must stay locked always, so we can't use it to go between 3 and 4.

Constraints to remember:
1. Must hold an object at least once.
2. Never be in room_3.
3. Purple_door_1 is always locked.
4. Must be in front of yellow_door_1 at some point.
5. Before being in front of yellow_door_1, must have held an object.
6. Must be in front of purple_door_1 at least once.
7. When in front of purple_door_1, either have been in room_1 or holding something before.

So, the plan must include these steps. Let's see:

Starting in room_4. Need to get to yellow_door_1 (in room_1 or room_3?), but can't go to room_3. The door connects room_1 and room_3. So to be in front of yellow_door_1, the agent must be in either room_1 or room_3. But since room_3 is forbidden, they must be in room_1. So the agent needs to go to room_1, stand in front of yellow_door_1 there, unlock it, and ensure it's unlocked.

But how to get to room_1 from room_4? The doors from room_4 are red_door_1 (connecting to room_2) and purple_door_1 (to room_3, but that's blocked). So the path is room_4 -> red_door_1 to room_2, then room_2 -> green_door_1 to room_1. But all doors are locked initially. So need to unlock them. However, the agent can only toggle a door if they are in front of it. So first, unlock red_door_1 (connects room_4 and 2). But to get in front of red_door_1 in room_4, the agent can 'gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2'. Wait, but the preconditions for gotodoor: must be in a room connected by d, and no object is blocking the position in front of d in the current room. Are there objects blocking doors? Let's check the initial state.

In room_4: objects are red_box_2, blue_ball_2, green_ball_1. Are any of these blocking doors? The initial state doesn't mention any objects blocking doors, so I think doors are unblocked. So the agent can go to red_door_1 in room_4, toggle it to unlock. Then go to room_2 via red_door_1. Then in room_2, go to green_door_1 (which is locked), but need to unlock it. But the agent is in room_2. To toggle green_door_1, they need to be in front of it. But green_door_1 connects room_1 and 2. So in room_2, the agent can 'gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_1', then toggle it. But the agent can't pick up any object yet. Wait, the constraint says they must hold an object at least once, and before being in front of yellow_door_1, they must have held an object. So maybe the agent needs to pick up an object before going to yellow_door_1.

But first, let's outline the steps:

1. From room_4, go to red_door_1 (since in room_4 and room_2 connected via red_door_1). Action: gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2.

2. Toggle red_door_1 to unlock it.

3. Then, gotoroom room_4 room_2 red_door_1 to enter room_2.

Now in room_2. In room_2, there are grey_box_1, yellow_box_1, yellow_ball_1. The agent needs to pick one of these to satisfy the holding constraint.

4. Gotoobject grey_box_1 room_2.

5. Pick grey_box_1 room_2. Now holding an object.

Now, the constraint that the agent must hold an object is satisfied. Now, need to go to green_door_1 in room_2.

6. Gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_1. But the door is locked. So toggle it.

Wait, but the agent is in front of green_door_1, which is locked. Toggle to unlock. But after that, can go to room_1.

7. Toggle green_door_1.

8. Gotoroom room_2 room_1 green_door_1. Now in room_1.

In room_1, there's red_box_1. The yellow_door_1 connects room_1 to room_3. The agent needs to be in front of yellow_door_1, which is in room_1. So:

9. Gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3. Now in front of yellow_door_1.

But the agent is holding grey_box_1. The constraint says that if in front of yellow_door_1, there must be an earlier state where holding something. That's already satisfied by step 5. So now, toggle yellow_door_1 to unlock it. Because the goal is for yellow_door_1 to be unlocked.

10. Toggle yellow_door_1. Now it's unlocked.

Now the goal requires being in front of yellow_door_1 (which we are) and it's not locked. So that's achieved.

But wait, the problem says the goal is "There is a door d such that d is yellow, connects room_3 and room_1, you are in front of d, and d is not locked." So once step 10 is done, all conditions are met.

But there are other constraints to check:

- Must be in front of purple_door_1 at some point. The agent is in room_1. To get to purple_door_1, which connects room_3 and 4. But the agent can't enter room_3. So the only way is to be in room_4 and go to purple_door_1. But how? The agent is currently in room_1. To get back to room_4, they have to go room_1 -> room_2 via green_door_1, then room_2 -> room_4 via red_door_1. But need to make sure to go to purple_door_1 in room_4.

Wait, the plan so far is steps 1-10. But after step 8, agent is in room_1. Steps 9 and 10: in front of yellow_door_1, toggle. Now, after that, to get to purple_door_1, need to go back to room_4. Let's see:

11. Need to go from room_1 to room_2 via green_door_1 (already unlocked). Then room_2 to room_4 via red_door_1 (which was unlocked earlier). Then in room_4, goto purple_door_1.

But wait, the constraint says that the agent must be in front of purple_door_1 at least once. So maybe after step 3, when the agent is in room_2, they can go back to room_4 and then go to purple_door_1. Alternatively, after step 10, the agent can return to room_4 and go to purple_door_1.

But let's check the current plan steps:

1. gotodoor red_door_1 room4 room2

2. toggle red_door_1 (unlock)

3. gotoroom room4 to room2 via red_door_1

4. gotoobject grey_box_1 room2

5. pick grey_box_1

6. gotodoor green_door_1 room2 room1

7. toggle green_door_1 (unlock)

8. gotoroom room2 to room1 via green_door_1

9. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room1 room3

10. toggle yellow_door_1 (unlock)

At this point, the goal is achieved. But the agent hasn't been in front of purple_door_1 yet, which is a constraint. Also, the agent is in room_1, which is allowed. To get to purple_door_1, the agent needs to be in room_4. So they need to go back.

But how? From room_1, go back to room_2 via green_door_1, then to room_4 via red_door_1. Then, in room_4, go to purple_door_1.

So steps after 10 would be:

11. gotoempty (to leave the front of yellow_door_1)

12. gotoroom room1 room2 green_door_1 (since green_door_1 is unlocked)

13. gotoempty

14. gotodoor red_door_1 room2 room4

15. gotoroom room2 room4 red_door_1

16. gotodoor purple_door_1 room4 room3

17. (now in front of purple_door_1 in room4)

But step 17 would satisfy the "must be in front of purple_door_1" constraint. Also, the constraint that if in front of purple_door_1, there must be an earlier state where either in room_1 or holding something. The agent was holding grey_box_1 (steps 5-10), and then maybe drops it later? Wait, when the agent is in room_1, after step 10, they are still holding the grey_box_1. So in step 11, when they go back, they are still holding it. So when they get to purple_door_1 in room4 (step 16), the agent is holding the grey_box_1. Therefore, the condition for being in front of purple_door_1 is satisfied because they are holding an object (which was picked up earlier). So that's okay.

But the plan needs to include being in front of purple_door_1. So steps 16 would be 'gotodoor purple_door_1 room4 room3', which is allowed as long as there's no object blocking. The agent can do that, even though the door is locked (since they just need to be in front of it, not go through). So that's okay.

But then, after that, the plan can proceed to drop the object if needed, but the goal is already achieved. However, the problem requires the plan to end once the goal is achieved. Wait, the problem says "bring about the goal of the problem while satisfying all constraints". So the plan must achieve the goal, but also meet all constraints during its execution. So the steps after achieving the goal (step 10) are necessary to satisfy the constraint of being in front of purple_door_1. But the goal is achieved at step 10, but the constraints require that in some state, the agent is in front of purple_door_1, which would be step 16. But since the plan must end when the goal is achieved, perhaps the steps after 10 are not needed? Wait, no. The plan must achieve the goal and satisfy all constraints throughout the plan. So the constraints must hold in the entire plan, including the steps after the goal is achieved. Wait, but the goal is the final state. Wait, no. The problem states: "bringing about the goal of the problem while satisfying all constraints". So the constraints must hold during the entire plan execution, and the goal must be true in the final state. So the plan must end when the goal is achieved, but all constraints must hold in all states during the plan. Therefore, the agent must have already been in front of purple_door_1 before the goal is achieved. But in the initial plan up to step 10, the agent hasn't been in front of purple_door_1. So that's a problem.

Therefore, the plan must include being in front of purple_door_1 at some point before achieving the goal. So we need to adjust the steps to include that.

Let me rethink.

Alternative approach: After unlocking red_door_1 and entering room2, before going to room1, perhaps the agent can first go back to room4 to be in front of purple_door_1.

Wait, initial steps:

Start in room4.

1. gotodoor red_door_1 room4 room2.

2. toggle red_door_1 (unlock).

3. gotoroom room4 to room2.

4. pick up an object (grey_box_1) in room2.

5. gotodoor red_door_1 room2 room4.

6. gotoroom room2 to room4.

7. gotodoor purple_door_1 room4 room3. (now in front of purple_door_1)

This would satisfy the constraint of being in front of purple_door_1. Also, when in front of purple_door_1, the earlier state must have been in room_1 or holding something. Here, the agent is holding grey_box_1 (from step4), so that's okay.

Then, after that, proceed to go back to room2, then to room1, etc.

But this would add steps but ensure that the agent is in front of purple_door_1.

But let's see:

So revised steps:

1. gotodoor red_door_1 room4 room2.

2. toggle red_door_1.

3. gotoroom room4 room2 red_door_1.

4. gotoobject grey_box_1 room2.

5. pick grey_box_1 room2. (now holding object)

6. gotodoor red_door_1 room2 room4.

7. gotoroom room2 room4 red_door_1.

8. gotodoor purple_door_1 room4 room3. (now in front of purple_door_1; satisfies the constraint)

Now, in room4, front of purple_door_1. Then need to go back to room2, then to room1.

9. gotoroom room4 room2 red_door_1.

10. gotodoor green_door_1 room2 room1.

11. toggle green_door_1 (unlock).

12. gotoroom room2 room1 green_door_1.

13. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room1 room3.

14. toggle yellow_door_1 (unlock).

At step14, the goal is achieved: in front of yellow_door_1 (which is yellow, connects room1 and 3, and is unlocked). The agent is in room1, in front of yellow_door_1, which is now unlocked. All constraints must be checked:

- At least once holding an object: step5.

- Never in room3: yes, agent is in room1, 2, 4.

- purple_door_1 remains locked: yes, because we never toggled it. Wait, in step8, the agent is in front of purple_door_1. If they don't toggle it, it's still locked. So the constraint that purple_door_1 is locked in every state is satisfied.

- At least once in front of yellow_door_1: step13 and 14.

- Before being in front of yellow_door_1 (step13), held object (step5).

- At least once in front of purple_door_1: step8.

- When in front of purple_door_1 (step8), earlier state had either room1 (no) or holding something (step5, yes). So that's okay.

This plan seems to meet all constraints.

But let's check all steps:

1. goto red_door_1 in room4.

2. toggle red_door_1 (unlock).

3. go to room2.

4. goto grey_box_1 in room2.

5. pick grey_box_1.

6. goto red_door_1 in room2.

7. go back to room4.

8. goto purple_door_1 in room4. (now in front of it)

9. go back to room2 via red_door_1.

10. goto green_door_1 in room2.

11. toggle green_door_1 (unlock).

12. go to room1.

13. goto yellow_door_1 in room1.

14. toggle yellow_door_1 (unlock).

Now, the plan has 14 steps. But maybe it can be optimized. For example, after step8 (in front of purple_door_1), the agent is in room4. To go to room2 again, they can use red_door_1 again. Then proceed to room1. But perhaps there's a shorter path.

Alternative: After step8, the agent is in room4, in front of purple_door_1. Then, they can go back to room2 (steps9-10), then to room1. Then proceed to yellow_door_1.

But the steps are necessary. Also, the plan must be optimal, i.e., as short as possible. Let's count the steps:

The current plan has 14 actions. Can we find a shorter plan?

Alternative approach: After unlocking red_door_1 and entering room2 (steps1-3), pick up an object (grey_box_1), then go to green_door_1, unlock it, go to room1, then go to yellow_door_1, unlock it. But we also need to be in front of purple_door_1. So after room1, how to get to purple_door_1? The agent is in room1. To get to purple_door_1 (in room4), they need to go back to room2, then room4. But that would require steps.

Alternatively, after step3 (in room2), before going to room1, go back to room4 to front of purple_door_1. So steps:

1. goto red_door_1 in room4.

2. toggle red_door_1.

3. go to room2.

4. goto grey_box_1.

5. pick it.

6. go to red_door_1 in room2.

7. go back to room4.

8. goto purple_door_1 in room4.

9. go back to room2.

10. go to green_door_1 in room2.

11. toggle.

12. go to room1.

13. goto yellow_door_1.

14. toggle.

That's 14 steps. But maybe there's a way to combine steps.

Wait, after step5 (holding grey_box_1), the agent can go to green_door_1 in room2, then toggle it. Then go to room1. Then goto yellow_door_1 and toggle. Then, before that, the agent needs to be in front of purple_door_1. So perhaps after step5, before going to green_door_1, the agent returns to room4 and front of purple_door_1.

So:

After step5 (picked up grey_box_1):

6. gotodoor red_door_1 room2 room4.

7. gotoroom room2 room4 red_door_1.

8. gotodoor purple_door_1 room4 room3. (front of purple_door_1)

9. gotoroom room4 room2 red_door_1. (go back to room2)

10. gotodoor green_door_1 room2 room1.

11. toggle green_door_1.

12. gotoroom room2 room1 green_door_1.

13. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room1 room3.

14. toggle yellow_door_1.

That's 14 steps. Same as before. But is there a way to avoid going back and forth?

Alternatively, can the agent go to purple_door_1 after toggling yellow_door_1? No, because the goal is achieved at step14, and the constraints must be met during the entire plan. So being in front of purple_door_1 must occur before step14.

Hmm. So maybe this is the optimal plan.

But let's check if there's a shorter path. For example, can the agent go to purple_door_1 earlier? Let's see.

Starting in room4:

1. gotodoor red_door_1 room4 room2.

2. toggle red_door_1.

3. gotoroom room4 room2 red_door_1.

4. goto grey_box_1 in room2.

5. pick it.

6. gotodoor red_door_1 room2 room4.

7. gotoroom room2 room4 red_door_1. (now in room4)

8. gotodoor purple_door_1 room4 room3. (front of purple_door_1)

9. gotoroom room4 room2 red_door_1. (back to room2)

10. gotodoor green_door_1 room2 room1.

11. toggle green_door_1.

12. gotoroom room2 room1 green_door_1.

13. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room1 room3.

14. toggle yellow_door_1.

That's 14 steps. But perhaps steps 6 and 7 can be merged? No, each action is a separate step.

Is there a way to avoid some steps? For example, after step8, maybe the agent can go directly to room1 through another path? No, because from room4, the only other door is purple_door_1 (locked, can't go through). So the agent must go back to room2 via red_door_1.

Alternatively, after step8, can the agent drop the box to save steps? But the constraint is to hold an object at least once, which is already satisfied. But dropping would require more steps. Not helpful.

Alternatively, after step8, the agent is in front of purple_door_1. Then, can they go to room3? No, because purple_door_1 is locked (constraint says it must remain locked). So they can't go through it. So they must stay in room4.

Thus, the steps seem necessary. Therefore, the plan has 14 steps, which might be optimal. But maybe there's a shorter way.

Wait, another approach: What if the agent uses the purple_door_1 constraint earlier. Let's see:

Start in room4.

1. gotodoor purple_door_1 room4 room3. (front of purple_door_1)

But initially, the agent is in room4. To go to purple_door_1, the precondition is that the agent is in a room connected by the door. Since purple_door_1 connects room4 and 3, the agent is in room4, so yes. Also, no objects blocking. So action: gotodoor purple_door_1 room4 room3.

This would satisfy the "must be in front of purple_door_1" constraint. But when in front of purple_door_1, the agent hasn't held any object yet. The constraint says that if in front of purple_door_1, there must be an earlier state where either in room_1 or holding something. At this point, the agent hasn't been in room_1 or held anything. So this violates the constraint. So this approach is invalid.

Therefore, the agent must first hold an object before going to purple_door_1.

Thus, the initial plan where they pick up an object first is necessary.

Another idea: After picking up the object in room2, go to room4, front of purple_door_1, then proceed.

Which is what the previous plan does.

So the steps seem necessary. Therefore, the optimal plan is 14 actions. But maybe I'm missing a shorter path.

Wait, after step3 (in room2), the agent can go to purple_door_1 via room4. But to get to room4, they need to go through red_door_1 (unlocked). So:

1. goto red_door_1 in room4.

2. toggle.

3. go to room2.

4. pick grey_box_1.

5. go to red_door_1 in room2.

6. go back to room4.

7. go to purple_door_1.

8. go back to room2.

9. go to green_door_1, toggle.

10. go to room1.

11. go to yellow_door_1, toggle.

That's 11 actions. Wait, but each "gotoroom" is a separate action. Let's count:

1. gotodoor red_door_1 room4 room2.

2. toggle red_door_1.

3. gotoroom room4 room2 red_door_1.

4. gotoobject grey_box_1 room2.

5. pick grey_box_1.

6. gotodoor red_door_1 room2 room4.

7. gotoroom room2 room4 red_door_1.

8. gotodoor purple_door_1 room4 room3.

9. gotoroom room4 room2 red_door_1.

10. gotodoor green_door_1 room2 room1.

11. toggle green_door_1.

12. gotoroom room2 room1 green_door_1.

13. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room1 room3.

14. toggle yellow_door_1.

That's 14 steps. So the initial plan is 14 steps. Can't seem to find a shorter one.

Alternatively, after step8 (in front of purple_door_1), can the agent go directly to room1 through another path? Unlikely. They are in room4, so to get to room1, they need to go via room2. So no shortcut.

Thus, this seems to be the optimal plan. Now, let's verify all constraints:

- Must hold an object at least once: step5.

- Never in room3: correct.

- purple_door_1 remains locked: yes, as we never toggle it.

- In front of yellow_door_1: step13.

- Before step13, held object (step5).

- In front of purple_door_1: step8.

- When in front of purple_door_1, earlier state: holding object (step5) before step8.

All constraints are satisfied.

Now, check the plan steps:

```
gotodoor red_door_1 room4 room2
toggle red_door_1
gotoroom room4 room2 red_door_1
gotoobject grey_box_1 room2
pick grey_box_1 room2
gotodoor red_door_1 room2 room4
gotoroom room2 room4 red_door_1
gotodoor purple_door_1 room4 room3
gotoroom room4 room2 red_door_1
gotodoor green_door_1 room2 room1
toggle green_door_1
gotoroom room2 room1 green_door_1
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room1 room3
toggle yellow_door_1
```

Count the steps: 14. Now, is there any shorter plan?

Wait, step6: 'gotodoor red_door_1 room2 room4' – but after step3, the agent is in room2. To go back to room4, they need to use red_door_1, which is unlocked. So steps6 and 7 are necessary.

Alternative: After step5, the agent is holding grey_box_1. Then, instead of going back to room4, can they go to green_door_1 in room2, unlock it, go to room1, then go to yellow_door_1, but then how to get to purple_door_1?

But then the agent would not have been in front of purple_door_1, violating the constraint. So that's not possible.

Therefore, the plan must include the steps to go back to room4 to be in front of purple_door_1.

Thus, the plan is 14 steps. However, perhaps there's a way to optimize the order.

Wait, after step5 (holding grey_box_1 in room2), instead of going back to room4, can they first go to green_door_1, unlock it, go to room1, then goto yellow_door_1, but then how to get to purple_door_1? Because the agent would need to go back through room2 to room4. That would require:

Steps after step5:

6. gotodoor green_door_1 room2 room1.

7. toggle green_door_1.

8. gotoroom room2 room1 green_door_1.

9. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room1 room3.

10. toggle yellow_door_1. (goal achieved)

But then, the agent hasn't been in front of purple_door_1 yet. So they need to go back to room2, then to room4, then to purple_door_1. Which would add steps, making the plan longer. So this approach is worse.

Thus, the original plan of 14 steps seems necessary.
