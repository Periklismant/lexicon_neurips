Okay, let's tackle this planning problem step by step. The goal is to get to a yellow door that connects room_3 and room_1, be in front of it, and have it unlocked. Let's start by understanding the initial state and the goal.

First, the initial state: the agent is in room_4. All doors are locked. The yellow_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3, and it's yellow. The goal requires that this door (d) is yellow, connects room_3 and room_1, the agent is in front of it, and it's unlocked. So the target door must be yellow_door_1. The agent needs to be in front of yellow_door_1 in either room_1 or room_3, and the door must be unlocked.

But the agent starts in room_4. So the path to yellow_door_1 would require moving through rooms. Let's look at the connections:

- room_4 is connected to room_2 via red_door_1 and to room_3 via purple_door_1. All doors are locked initially. So to move from room_4 to another room, the agent needs to unlock the respective door. However, unlocking a door requires being in front of it and toggling it. But to get in front of a door, the agent must be in a room connected by that door. Wait, the preconditions for "gotodoor" are that the agent is in a room connected by the door, and there's no object blocking the position in front of the door.

Looking at the objects in each room:

In room_4, there's red_box_2, blue_ball_2, green_ball_1. So if any of these are in front of the doors (purple_door_1 or red_door_1), they would block access. But the initial state doesn't mention any objects blocking doors. Wait, the initial state doesn't say anything about objects blocking doors, except the effect of picking up an object that was blocking a door. So maybe we can assume that the doors are not blocked unless an object is in front. But since the agent is in room_4, to get to the doors in room_4 (purple_door_1 and red_door_1), the agent can go to those doors if they are not blocked.

But since all doors are locked, the agent can't go through them yet. So first, the agent needs to unlock the doors. But to unlock a door, the agent must be in front of it and toggle it. So the agent needs to go to the door in their current room, unlock it, then go through.

But the agent is in room_4. Let's see which doors connect room_4. The doors are red_door_1 (connects room_4 and room_2) and purple_door_1 (connects room_4 and room_3). Both are locked. So to get out of room_4, the agent needs to unlock one of these doors.

But how? To unlock a door, the agent must first be in front of it. So first, go to the door in room_4. Let's pick purple_door_1 first. The agent is in room_4. So to go to purple_door_1, the agent can do "gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_3". Then, toggle it to unlock. Then, use "gotoroom room_4 room_3 purple_door_1" to move to room_3. Once in room_3, the agent can then try to reach yellow_door_1, which connects room_1 and room_3. But yellow_door_1 is locked initially. So the agent needs to unlock that as well.

Wait, but the goal is to have the yellow door (yellow_door_1) unlocked. So the agent needs to get to yellow_door_1 and toggle it. But yellow_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3. So to get to yellow_door_1, the agent can be in room_1 or room_3 and go to that door.

So the plan would involve:

1. From room_4, unlock purple_door_1 to get to room_3.
2. From room_3, unlock yellow_door_1 to connect to room_1.
3. Then go to yellow_door_1 and ensure it's unlocked.

But let's think step by step.

Starting in room_4. To unlock purple_door_1:

- gotoempty (to get in front of an empty spot, but maybe not necessary. Wait, the agent is in room_4. To go to the door, the action is "gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_3". Precondition: agent is in a room connected by the door (room_4 is connected via purple_door_1 to room_3). Also, no object is blocking the position in front of the door in room_4. Are there any objects in front of the door? The initial state doesn't mention any, so assuming it's not blocked. So the agent can do "gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_3". Then, "toggle purple_door_1" to unlock it. Then, "gotoroom room_4 room_3 purple_door_1" to move to room_3.

Once in room_3, the agent can then go to yellow_door_1. Since room_3 is connected to room_1 via yellow_door_1. But yellow_door_1 is locked. So the agent needs to be in front of it to toggle. So:

In room_3, do "gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1". Then toggle to unlock. Then, the door is unlocked. Then, the agent needs to be in front of it, which they already are after the gotodoor action. Wait, after "gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1", the agent is in front of it. Then toggle to unlock. Then the goal requires being in front of d (yellow_door_1) and d is not locked. So after these steps, the agent is in front of yellow_door_1 and it's unlocked.

Wait, let's check:

After toggling yellow_door_1, it becomes unlocked. Then the agent is still in front of it. So the goal is satisfied.

So the steps would be:

From room_4:

1. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_3
2. toggle purple_door_1 (unlocks it)
3. gotoroom room_4 room_3 purple_door_1 (now in room_3)
4. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1
5. toggle yellow_door_1 (unlocks it)

At this point, the agent is in front of yellow_door_1 in room_3, and the door is unlocked. This satisfies the goal: there exists a door d (yellow_door_1) which is yellow, connects room_3 and room_1, the agent is in front of it, and it's not locked.

But wait, the initial state says the agent is in room_4. So steps 1-3 get them to room_3. Then steps 4-5 get them to the door and unlock it. That seems correct.

But are there any constraints? The problem says to provide a valid plan that satisfies all constraints. The user didn't mention any additional constraints beyond the action preconditions. So the plan above should work.

Let me check the preconditions for each action:

1. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_3: Agent is in room_4, which is connected via purple_door_1. No objects blocking in room_4? Since initial state doesn't mention any, allowed.

2. toggle purple_door_1: Agent is in front of purple_door_1 after step 1. So allowed.

3. gotoroom room_4 room_3 purple_door_1: Door is now unlocked (from step 2). So preconditions met.

4. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_3 room_1: Agent is in room_3, connected via yellow_door_1. No blocking objects? Assuming allowed.

5. toggle yellow_door_1: Agent is in front of it. Toggle unlocks it.

Yes, this plan should work. The final state has the agent in front of yellow_door_1 (in room_3), which is yellow, connects room_3 and room_1, and is unlocked. So this meets all the goal conditions.
