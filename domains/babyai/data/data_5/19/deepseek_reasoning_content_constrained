Okay, let's tackle this planning problem step by step. The goal is to get a blue box that I'm holding. The constraints are a bit complex, so I need to make sure each one is satisfied.

First, the initial state: I'm in room_4. All doors are locked. The blue boxes are in room_1 (blue_box_1) and room_3 (blue_box_2). The goal is to hold a blue box. So I need to get to either room_1 or room_3, unlock the necessary doors, pick up a blue box, and make sure all constraints are met along the way.

Constraints to consider:

1. red_door_1 must always be locked. So I can't unlock it at any point. That means I can't use the red_door_1 to move between room_3 and room_4. So the path from room_4 to room_3 via red_door_1 is blocked. Similarly, room_4 to room_2 is via purple_door_1, which is initially locked. So I need to unlock that if needed.

Wait, the doors connecting the rooms: room_1-room_2 via blue_door_1, room_1-room_3 via green_door_1, room_2-room_4 via purple_door_1, and room_3-room_4 via red_door_1. But red_door_1 is locked and must stay locked. So from room_4, the only doors are purple_door_1 (to room_2) and red_door_1 (to room_3, but can't use it). So to get out of room_4, I have to go through purple_door_1 to room_2, but that door is locked. So first, I need to unlock purple_door_1. But how? To toggle a door, I need to be in front of it. So I need to go to purple_door_1 in room_4. But to go to the door, I need to be in a room connected by that door. Since I'm in room_4, purple_door_1 connects room_2 and room_4. So in room_4, I can go in front of purple_door_1, then toggle it to unlock. But wait, the precondition for "gotodoor d r1 r2" is that I'm in a room that d connects. So from room_4, purple_door_1 connects room_4 and room_2, so yes, I can go to that door. But the door is locked. Wait, the "toggle" action can unlock it if I'm in front of it. So the plan would be:

1. In room_4, go to purple_door_1 (since it connects room_4 and room_2). The action would be "gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_2". But I need to check if there's any object blocking the position in front of the door. The initial state in room_4 has red_box_1 and yellow_box_1. Are they blocking the door? The problem statement doesn't mention objects blocking doors unless they are in front. Wait, the "goto door" action's precondition says (ii) there's no object blocking the position in front of d in the current room. So if in room_4, the purple_door_1 is connected to room_2, but in room_4, is there any object blocking the position in front of purple_door_1? The initial state says red_box_1 and yellow_box_1 are in room_4, but their positions aren't specified. The problem might assume that unless stated, objects are not blocking doors. So assuming that, I can go to the door. Then, toggle it to unlock. Then, use gotoroom to move to room_2.

But then, after unlocking purple_door_1, I can go from room_4 to room_2. From there, maybe go to room_1 via blue_door_1 (but that's locked initially). So need to unlock blue_door_1. But blue_door_1 connects room_1 and room_2. So if I'm in room_2, I can go to blue_door_1, toggle it, then enter room_1. Then pick up blue_box_1.

Alternatively, from room_2, maybe go to room_4, then to room_3 via red_door_1? But red_door_1 must stay locked, so that's not possible. Alternatively, from room_2 to room_4 via purple_door_1 (unlocked), then room_4 to room_3 via red_door_1 is impossible. So maybe the other path: from room_2 to room_1 via blue_door_1 (needs unlocking), then room_1 to room_3 via green_door_1 (which is locked), unlock that, then go to room_3 and get blue_box_2.

But the goal is to hold a blue box. So which blue box is easier? blue_box_1 is in room_1, blue_box_2 in room_3.

Let me outline possible steps:

Starting in room_4:

1. gotoempty (to be in front of an empty spot, but why? Maybe not necessary. Alternatively, go to a door.

But first, need to unlock purple_door_1 to get out of room_4. So:

1. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_2 (precondition: in room_4, door connects room_4 and room_2, no object blocking. Assuming no objects blocking, so possible)
2. toggle purple_door_1 (now it's unlocked)
3. gotoroom room_4 room_2 purple_door_1 (now in room_2)
4. Now, need to get to room_1 to get blue_box_1. But blue_door_1 is locked. So in room_2, go to blue_door_1 (gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1)
5. toggle blue_door_1 to unlock
6. gotoroom room_2 room_1 blue_door_1 (now in room_1)
7. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1
8. pick blue_box_1 room_1

This would satisfy the goal. But let's check the constraints.

Constraints:

1. red_door_1 must always be locked. Since we never touch it, that's okay.

2. At least one of "you are in front of purple_ball_2" or "you are in room_2" must hold in at least one state. Well, when we go to room_2 (step 3), that condition is met.

3. "you are holding some object" must hold in at least one state. Step 8 satisfies this.

4. If holding an object, there must be an earlier state where purple_box_1 is in room_4 or you are in room_1. When we pick blue_box_1 in room_1, the earlier state of being in room_1 (step 6 and 7) satisfies the "you are in room_1" part. So that's okay.

5. "you are in room_4" must hold in at least one state. The initial state satisfies this, but the problem says the initial state is part of the states. Wait, the constraints are for every state, so the initial state counts. So the initial state already satisfies the "you are in room_4" condition. So that's covered.

6. If in room_4 (which is true initially and maybe later), then in that state or after, you must be in front of red_box_1. The initial state has you in room_4 but not in front of red_box_1. So after the initial state, if you are ever in room_4 again, you need to be in front of red_box_1. Wait, the constraint says: if you are in room_4 in some state s, then in s or after, you must be in front of red_box_1. The initial state is room_4, so in that state, you are not in front of red_box_1. Therefore, after the initial state, in subsequent steps, if you are in room_4 again, you need to be in front of red_box_1. But in the plan above, after leaving room_4 (step 3), we don't return. So the initial state is the only state where you are in room_4, and in that state, you are not in front of red_box_1. So this violates the constraint because the initial state s has you in room_4 but not in front of red_box_1. Therefore, the plan must ensure that in the initial state, you either are in front of red_box_1 or in some later state after being in room_4, you are in front of red_box_1. Wait, the constraint is: if you are in room_4 in state s, then in s or after, you are in front of red_box_1. So the initial state s0 has you in room_4, so either s0 must have you in front of red_box_1, or in some state after s0 (which is all subsequent actions), you must be in front of red_box_1. But since in the initial state, you are not in front of red_box_1, you need to, after s0, have a state where you are in front of red_box_1. However, in the plan above, you leave room_4 in step 3 and don't come back. So the constraint is violated because after s0 (the initial state), there is no state where you are in front of red_box_1. Therefore, the plan must include a step where you are in front of red_box_1 after being in room_4.

So how to satisfy that? Let's adjust the plan. After starting in room_4, maybe first go to red_box_1, then proceed. But to pick up red_box_1 is not needed, but just being in front of it. Let's see:

Original steps modified:

1. In room_4, go to red_box_1 (if possible). But in room_4, red_box_1 is present. So action: gotoobject red_box_1 room_4. Precondition: you are in the same room as the object. Yes. So:

1. gotoobject red_box_1 room_4 (now in front of red_box_1)
2. Then proceed to unlock purple_door_1.

But then, after step 1, you are in front of red_box_1. So the constraint is satisfied: in the initial state, you were in room_4 but not in front. But after step 1, you are in front. So the first time you are in room_4 is the initial state. Then, step 1 is still in room_4, right? Because gotoobject doesn't change your room. So after step 1, you are still in room_4 but in front of red_box_1. So the constraint is satisfied because in the state after step 1 (which is after the initial state), you are in front of red_box_1. Therefore, the constraint is met.

So adjusting the plan:

1. gotoobject red_box_1 room_4 (satisfies the constraint that after being in room_4, you are in front of red_box_1)
2. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_2
3. toggle purple_door_1 (unlock)
4. gotoroom room_4 room_2 purple_door_1
5. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1
6. toggle blue_door_1 (unlock)
7. gotoroom room_2 room_1 blue_door_1
8. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1
9. pick blue_box_1 room_1

Now, check constraints:

- The step 1 puts you in front of red_box_1 in room_4, satisfying the constraint that after being in room_4, you are in front of red_box_1. The initial state is room_4, then step 1 is in room_4 and front of red_box_1. So the constraint is met.

Another constraint: At least one state must have you in front of yellow_box_1 or purple_door_1. Let's see:

In step 2, gotodoor purple_door_1 in room_4, which puts you in front of purple_door_1. So step 2's effect is being in front of purple_door_1. So that satisfies the constraint.

Also, the constraint that when you hold an object (step 9), there must be an earlier state where either purple_box_1 is in room_4 or you are in room_1. The earlier state is step 7 (gotoroom to room_1), so that's satisfied.

Another constraint: you must hold some object in at least one state (step 9).

Another constraint: you must be in room_2 at some point (step 4), which covers the second constraint.

So this plan seems to satisfy all constraints.

But wait, step 1: gotoobject red_box_1 room_4. Then step 2: gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_2. When you perform step 2, you are no longer in front of red_box_1 (because the effect of gotodoor is that you are now in front of the door). So the constraint that after being in room_4, you are in front of red_box_1 is satisfied because in step 1, you are in room_4 and in front of red_box_1. The initial state is room_4, and the next state (step 1) is still in room_4 but in front of red_box_1. So the constraint is satisfied.

Wait, the constraint says: if you are in room_4 in some state s, then in s or after, you must be in front of red_box_1. For the initial state s0 (room_4, not in front), then after s0, you have step 1 where you are in front. So the constraint is satisfied.

Now, check the other constraint: you must have in at least one state, you are in front of purple_ball_2 or in room_2. Step 4 is in room_2, so that's covered.

Another constraint: when holding an object (step 9), there must be an earlier state where either purple_box_1 is in room_4 (it's initially in room_2) or you are in room_1. The earlier state is step 7 (gotoroom to room_1), which is before step 9. So that's okay.

The step where you toggle purple_door_1 (step 3) unlocks it, allowing movement to room_2.

So this plan should work. Let's check if there's a shorter plan. Maybe combining steps.

Wait, after step 1 (gotoobject red_box_1), can we then directly go to the door? Let's see:

After step 1, you are in front of red_box_1. To go to the door, you need to do gotodoor, which requires you to be in the same room as the door (room_4). Yes. So step 2 is gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_2.

But after step 2, you are in front of purple_door_1. Then toggle (step 3). Then gotoroom (step 4) to room_2.

Proceeding as before.

So the plan has 9 steps. Is there a way to make it shorter? Let's see.

Alternative approach: Instead of going to room_1 for blue_box_1, can we go to room_3 for blue_box_2?

From room_4, after unlocking purple_door_1, go to room_2, then from room_2 to room_4 (but that's a loop). Alternatively, from room_2 to room_1 via blue_door_1, but that's what the original plan does. Alternatively, from room_2, is there another door? No, room_2 is connected to room_1 and room_4. To get to room_3, you'd need to go through room_1 via green_door_1. So room_1 to room_3 via green_door_1, which is locked. So need to unlock that. So that path would require more steps.

Alternatively, from room_4, go to room_2, then to room_4 again? Not helpful. So original plan seems optimal.

Another check: the constraint that in at least one state, you are in front of yellow_box_1 or purple_door_1. In step 2, you are in front of purple_door_1, so that's covered.

So the plan seems valid. Now, let's write it out step by step with the actions.
