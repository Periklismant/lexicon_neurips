Let me analyze the planning problem:

1. Initial state:
   - I am in room_4.
   - blue_box_1 is in room_1, and it's blue.
   - purple_box_1, purple_ball_1, and purple_ball_2 are in room_2.
   - blue_box_2 and purple_box_2 are in room_3.
   - red_box_1 and yellow_box_1 are in room_4.
   - All doors (blue_door_1, green_door_1, purple_door_1, red_door_1) are locked.
   - Room connections: room_1 and room_2 via blue_door_1, room_1 and room_3 via green_door_1, room_2 and room_4 via purple_door_1, room_3 and room_4 via red_door_1.

2. Goal:
   - To hold a blue box (which must be either blue_box_1 or blue_box_2).

3. Constraints:
   - C1: red_door_1 must always remain locked.
   - C2: At some point, I need to be in front of purple_ball_2 or in room_2.
   - C3: At some point, I need to be holding some object.
   - C4: Before holding any object, I need to either have purple_box_1 in room_4 or be in room_1.
   - C5: At some point, I need to be in room_4 (already satisfied in the initial state).
   - C6: After being in room_4, I need to be in front of red_box_1 at some point.
   - C7: At some point, I need to be in front of yellow_box_1 or purple_door_1.

Ok, let's sketch a plan:

First, I need to get one of the blue boxes (either blue_box_1 from room_1 or blue_box_2 from room_3). Since I'm in room_4, and red_door_1 must remain locked (C1), I need to use purple_door_1 to get to room_2 and then blue_door_1 to get to room_1, or I could use purple_door_1 to get to room_2 and then use another path to room_3.

Let's try the first path (room_4 -> room_2 -> room_1):

1. I need to go in front of purple_door_1 (which also satisfies C7).
2. I need to toggle purple_door_1 to unlock it.
3. I need to go to room_2 from room_4 via purple_door_1 (which satisfies C2).
4. Go in front of blue_door_1.
5. Toggle blue_door_1 to unlock it.
6. Go to room_1 from room_2 via blue_door_1 (which satisfies C4).
7. Go in front of blue_box_1.
8. Pick up blue_box_1 (which satisfies C3).

This satisfies the goal (I am holding a blue box), but we need to check the remaining constraints:

- C6 requires that after being in room_4, I need to be in front of red_box_1 at some point. This isn't satisfied in the plan so far.

So, before leaving room_4, I should:

1. Go in front of red_box_1 (which satisfies C6).
2. (Then proceed with the rest of the plan)

Let's refine the plan:

1. Go in front of red_box_1 in room_4 (satisfies C6).
2. Go in front of purple_door_1 (satisfies C7).
3. Toggle purple_door_1 to unlock it.
4. Go to room_2 from room_4 via purple_door_1 (satisfies C2).
5. Go in front of blue_door_1.
6. Toggle blue_door_1 to unlock it.
7. Go to room_1 from room_2 via blue_door_1 (satisfies C4).
8. Go in front of blue_box_1.
9. Pick up blue_box_1 (satisfies C3).

This satisfies all the constraints and achieves the goal (I am holding a blue box). Let me check one more time:

- Goal: I am holding a blue box (blue_box_1). ✓
- C1: red_door_1 remains locked throughout. ✓
- C2: I am in room_2 at some point. ✓
- C3: I am holding an object (blue_box_1). ✓
- C4: Before holding any object, I'm in room_1. ✓
- C5: I am in room_4 at some point (initially). ✓
- C6: After being in room_4, I am in front of red_box_1. ✓
- C7: I am in front of purple_door_1 at some point. ✓

Great! Now, let's formalize the plan with the specific actions:

1. gotoobject red_box_1 room_4
2. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_2
3. toggle purple_door_1
4. gotoroom room_4 room_2 purple_door_1
5. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1
6. toggle blue_door_1
7. gotoroom room_2 room_1 blue_door_1
8. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1
9. pick blue_box_1 room_1

Wait, let me check once more if this plan satisfies constraint C4:

C4: "If 'you are holding some object' holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which 'At least one of the following conditions is true: purple_box_1 is in room_4, you are in room_1' is true."

In our plan, before I pick up blue_box_1 (step 9), I am in room_1 (step 7), so C4 is indeed satisfied.

Actually, there's a potential issue here. Let's check the preconditions for the "gotodoor" action:

"goto door": you may only go in front of a door d if (i) you are in a room which door d is connecting with another room, and (ii) there is no object blocking the position in front of d in the room you are currently in.

The plan assumes that no object is blocking any of the doors. If that's the case, the plan is valid. But I should double-check the initial state to make sure.

In the initial state, there is no explicit mention of any object blocking any door, so I'll assume that the positions in front of all doors are clear. In that case, the plan is valid.

One more check: For constraint C2, I need to be in front of purple_ball_2 or in room_2. In the plan, I do go to room_2, so C2 is satisfied.

Ok, the plan is valid and satisfies all constraints. Let's finalize it:

1. gotoobject red_box_1 room_4
2. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_2
3. toggle purple_door_1
4. gotoroom room_4 room_2 purple_door_1
5. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1
6. toggle blue_door_1
7. gotoroom room_2 room_1 blue_door_1
8. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1
9. pick blue_box_1 room_1

I believe this is an optimal (shortest) plan to achieve the goal while satisfying all constraints.

Hmm, let me actually verify. I need to check:

1. Are there any other paths to get a blue box?
   - If I go to room_3 to get blue_box_2, I'd need to unlock red_door_1, which violates constraint C1. So, getting blue_box_1 from room_1 is the only viable option.

2. Can I optimize the path to get to blue_box_1?
   - I start in room_4, and the only way to get to room_1 (without using red_door_1) is through room_2 via purple_door_1 and then blue_door_1. I can't see any shorter path.

3. Are all steps necessary?
   - gotoobject red_box_1 room_4: Needed for constraint C6.
   - gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_2: Needed to unlock the door and for constraint C7.
   - toggle purple_door_1: Needed to unlock the door.
   - gotoroom room_4 room_2 purple_door_1: Needed to go to room_2 and for constraint C2.
   - gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1: Needed to unlock the door.
   - toggle blue_door_1: Needed to unlock the door.
   - gotoroom room_2 room_1 blue_door_1: Needed to go to room_1 and for constraint C4.
   - gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1: Needed to get in front of the box.
   - pick blue_box_1 room_1: Needed to pick up the box, achieve the goal, and satisfy constraint C3.

I don't think I can eliminate any step, so the plan is optimal.

Hang on. Let's double-check that I'm actually in front of the red box in step 1:

After performing "gotoobject red_box_1 room_4", I should be in front of red_box_1. This satisfies C6.

Ok, I think the plan is optimal and satisfies all constraints.

Actually wait, I just thought of a faster way to do this potentially. Let me just double-check if this constraint is satisfied by the initial state:

C4: "If expression 'you are holding some object' holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: 'At least one of the following conditions is true: purple_box_1 is in room_4, you are in room_1'"

In the initial state, purple_box_1 is in room_2, not room_4, and I am in room_4, not room_1. So the constraint is not satisfied initially.

For this constraint to be satisfied, I either need to:
1. Visit room_1 before picking up any object.
2. Move purple_box_1 to room_4 before picking up any object.

Moving purple_box_1 to room_4 would require visiting room_2, picking up purple_box_1, and bringing it to room_4. But to visit room_2, I'd need to go through the same path I outlined earlier. And once in room_2, it would be more efficient to continue to room_1 to get blue_box_1 rather than backtrack to room_4 with purple_box_1 and then go all the way to room_1 for blue_box_1.

So the original plan is still optimal.

1. gotoobject red_box_1 room_4
2. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_2
3. toggle purple_door_1
4. gotoroom room_4 room_2 purple_door_1
5. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1
6. toggle blue_door_1
7. gotoroom room_2 room_1 blue_door_1
8. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1
9. pick blue_box_1 room_1

This plan satisfies all constraints and achieves the goal in the most efficient way possible.

Actually, I realized there's yet another constraint I need to double-check:

C2: "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'At least one of the following conditions is true: "you are in front of purple_ball_2", "you are in room_2"'"

In the plan, I go to room_2 (step 4), which satisfies this constraint. But I realized that I could also satisfy it by going in front of purple_ball_2 in room_2. Let's consider if this could make the plan more efficient:

If I'm in room_2 (after step 4), going in front of purple_ball_2 would be an additional step, making the plan longer. So it's more efficient to just pass through room_2, which already satisfies C2, rather than adding an extra step to go in front of purple_ball_2.

Ok, the plan is optimal as is.

Wait, I just had another thought. Let me double-check the goal one more time:

Goal: "There is a box v such that 'The following conditions are all true: "v is blue", "you are holding v"'"

So I need to pick up a blue box. We have blue_box_1 in room_1 and blue_box_2 in room_3. I had ruled out getting blue_box_2 from room_3 because it would require unlocking red_door_1, which violates constraint C1.

But actually, there's another path from room_4 to room_3:
room_4 -> room_2 (via purple_door_1) -> room_1 (via blue_door_1) -> room_3 (via green_door_1)

Let's compare the two paths:
1. To get blue_box_1: room_4 -> room_2 -> room_1 (3 rooms, 2 doors)
2. To get blue_box_2: room_4 -> room_2 -> room_1 -> room_3 (4 rooms, 3 doors)

Clearly, getting blue_box_1 is more efficient. So the original plan is still optimal.

One final check on the optimality of the plan:

1. gotoobject red_box_1 room_4
   This satisfies constraint C6.

2. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_2
   This satisfies constraint C7 and gets us in front of the door to room_2.

3. toggle purple_door_1
   Needed to unlock the door.

4. gotoroom room_4 room_2 purple_door_1
   This satisfies constraint C2 and gets us to room_2.

5. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1
   Needed to get in front of the door to room_1.

6. toggle blue_door_1
   Needed to unlock the door.

7. gotoroom room_2 room_1 blue_door_1
   This satisfies constraint C4 and gets us to room_1.

8. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1
   Needed to get in front of the box.

9. pick blue_box_1 room_1
   This satisfies constraint C3 and achieves the goal.

All steps are necessary to satisfy the constraints and achieve the goal. I can't see any way to make the plan more efficient. So the plan is optimal.

Actually, let me see if I can optimize the plan in a different way. Can I check if there's any constraint or goal that gets satisfied early on, but then becomes irrelevant?

For instance, after I'm in room_2 (step 4), constraint C2 ("you are in front of purple_ball_2" or "you are in room_2") is satisfied. Since the constraint only requires this to be true in at least one state, it doesn't matter if it becomes false later.

In the original plan:
- C5 ("you are in room_4") is satisfied at the start and remains irrelevant for the rest of the plan.
- C6 ("after being in room_4, you need to be in front of red_box_1 at some point") is satisfied in step 1 and remains irrelevant for the rest of the plan.
- C7 ("you are in front of yellow_box_1 or purple_door_1") is satisfied in step 2 and remains irrelevant for the rest of the plan.
- C2 ("you are in front of purple_ball_2 or in room_2") is satisfied in step 4 and remains irrelevant for the rest of the plan.
- C4 ("before holding any object, purple_box_1 is in room_4 or you are in room_1") is satisfied in step 7 and remains relevant until step 9.
- C3 ("you are holding some object") is satisfied in step 9 and remains irrelevant for the rest of the plan.
- C1 ("red_door_1 is locked") is always satisfied throughout the plan.

All of these constraints seem to be addressed at the appropriate time in the plan, and I don't see a way to reorder steps to make the plan more efficient.

I think the plan is optimal as is:

1. gotoobject red_box_1 room_4
2. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_2
3. toggle purple_door_1
4. gotoroom room_4 room_2 purple_door_1
5. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1
6. toggle blue_door_1
7. gotoroom room_2 room_1 blue_door_1
8. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1
9. pick blue_box_1 room_1

Final double-check: All constraints satisfied, goal achieved, and the plan is optimal. I think I'm good.

Actually, let me do one final check to make sure I didn't miss any constraints or goals:

Goal: Hold a blue box (blue_box_1 or blue_box_2).
- Satisfied in step 9 when I pick up blue_box_1.

C1: red_door_1 must always remain locked.
- Satisfied throughout the plan as I never toggle red_door_1.

C2: At some point, be in front of purple_ball_2 or in room_2.
- Satisfied in step 4 when I go to room_2.

C3: At some point, be holding some object.
- Satisfied in step 9 when I pick up blue_box_1.

C4: Before holding any object, either purple_box_1 is in room_4 or be in room_1.
- Satisfied in step 7 when I go to room_1, which happens before I pick up the box in step 9.

C5: At some point, be in room_4.
- Satisfied at the start as I'm initially in room_4.

C6: After being in room_4, at some point be in front of red_box_1.
- Satisfied in step 1 when I go in front of red_box_1 after being in room_4.

C7: At some point, be in front of yellow_box_1 or purple_door_1.
- Satisfied in step 2 when I go in front of purple_door_1.

All constraints and the goal are satisfied by the plan. And I believe the plan is optimal as I can't see a shorter sequence of actions that would achieve the goal while satisfying all constraints.

1. gotoobject red_box_1 room_4
2. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_2
3. toggle purple_door_1
4. gotoroom room_4 room_2 purple_door_1
5. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1
6. toggle blue_door_1
7. gotoroom room_2 room_1 blue_door_1
8. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1
9. pick blue_box_1 room_1

I've checked and re-checked, and this is the optimal plan for the given problem.

Actually, I just had another thought. Let me double-check the preconditions for "gotodoor":

"goto door": you may only go in front of a door d if (i) you are in a room which door d is connecting with another room, and (ii) there is no object blocking the position in front of d in the room you are currently in.

Are there any objects blocking the positions in front of the doors? Let's check the initial state again...

In the initial state, there is no explicit mention of any object blocking any door. So I'm going to operate under the assumption that the positions in front of all doors are clear. If that's the case, the plan is valid.

I think I'm done. The plan I've outlined is optimal for the given problem and satisfies all constraints.

1. gotoobject red_box_1 room_4
2. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_4 room_2
3. toggle purple_door_1
4. gotoroom room_4 room_2 purple_door_1
5. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1
6. toggle blue_door_1
7. gotoroom room_2 room_1 blue_door_1
8. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1
9. pick blue_box_1 room_1
