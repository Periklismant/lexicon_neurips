Okay, let's tackle this planning problem step by step. First, I need to understand the initial state, the goal, and the constraints. 

The initial state says the agent is in room_2. The goal is to have a blue ball that the agent is in front of. The blue_ball_1 is in room_3, so that's probably the target. The constraints are a bit complex. Let me list them out:

1. Purple_door_1 must always be locked. So we can't unlock it at any point.
2. The agent can never be in room_1. So all actions must avoid entering room_1.
3. The agent must be in room_3 at least once. 
4. If the agent is in room_3, there must have been a prior state where they were in front of green_box_2 or an empty position.
5. The agent must be in room_2 at least once. But since they start there, maybe that's already satisfied, but perhaps they have to return later.
6. Whenever the agent is in room_2 (in some state s), either they are in front of yellow_ball_1 or holding blue_box_1 at s or a later state. But yellow_ball_1 is in room_1, which the agent can't enter. So the only option is to hold blue_box_1, which is in room_4. So the agent needs to get blue_box_1 and either be in room_2 while holding it or later.
7. The agent must be in front of purple_door_1 at least once. Purple_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3. But since the agent can't enter room_1, they can only approach it from room_3's side. But to get to room_3, they might need to go through other doors.
8. If the agent is in front of purple_door_1, there must have been a prior state where they were in front of green_box_2 (in room_3) or in room_4. So to get to purple_door_1 (from room_3), they must have previously been in front of green_box_2 or in room_4.

So the main steps needed are:

- Get the blue_ball_1 from room_3. To do that, the agent needs to go to room_3. But the doors are all locked initially. The available doors are yellow_door_1 (room_1-2, locked), purple_door_1 (room_1-3, locked), green_door_1 (room_2-4, locked), and yellow_door_2 (room_3-4, locked). The agent starts in room_2. So the first challenge is unlocking doors to move between rooms. However, purple_door_1 must stay locked, so the agent can't use that. So possible paths from room_2: 

From room_2, the connected doors are yellow_door_1 (to room_1, forbidden) and green_door_1 (to room_4). So maybe the agent needs to unlock green_door_1 first. But green_door_1 is locked. To toggle it, the agent needs to be in front of it. But to be in front of green_door_1, they need to be in room_2 (since green_door_1 connects room_2 and room_4). So the agent can go to green_door_1 from room_2, toggle it to unlock, then go to room_4. Then from room_4, yellow_door_2 connects to room_3. But yellow_door_2 is also locked. So the agent would need to go to yellow_door_2 in room_4, toggle it, then go to room_3.

Wait, but how to get to room_4? Let's outline possible steps:

1. In room_2. Need to unlock green_door_1. To do that, go to green_door_1 (from room_2), toggle it. Then go to room_4 via green_door_1. Once in room_4, then go to yellow_door_2 (connects to room_3). Toggle yellow_door_2 (unlock), then go to room_3. Now in room_3, can get the blue_ball_1.

But wait, the agent starts in room_2. Let's see the steps:

- gotoempty (since in room_2, maybe not necessary, but perhaps to get in front of an empty spot to then go to the door. Wait, the preconditions for gotodoor: need to be in a room connected by the door, and no object is blocking the door's position. Are there any objects blocking the doors? The initial state doesn't mention any objects blocking doors. So maybe the agent can directly go to green_door_1 from room_2.

So:

Action: gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4 (since green_door_1 connects room_2 and room_4). Then toggle green_door_1 (unlocking it). Then gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1. Now in room_4. Then in room_4, need to unlock yellow_door_2 to get to room_3. So goto yellow_door_2 from room_4 (gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_3), toggle it (unlock), then gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_2. Now in room_3. Then gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_3, pick it up. Then drop it? Wait, the goal is to be in front of a blue ball. But the blue_ball_1 is already in room_3, so perhaps just go in front of it and ensure you are there. Wait, the goal is "There is a ball v such that v is blue and you are in front of v". So blue_ball_1 is in room_3. So the agent needs to be in room_3, in front of blue_ball_1. So after arriving in room_3, the agent can gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_3. Then they are in front of it, satisfying the goal.

But also, the constraints:

- Must be in room_3 at least once. Check.

- When in room_3, must have previously been in front of green_box_2 (which is in room_3) or empty. So when arriving in room_3 via yellow_door_2, the agent is in room_3 but not in front of anything. Then perhaps when they first enter room_3, they need to gotoempty or goto green_box_2. Let's see:

After entering room_3 (from room_4), the agent is in room_3. The initial position after entering a room is not specified, but the effect says that after goto room, you are no longer in front of any object. So perhaps the agent is in room_3, not in front of anything. Then they need to either go to green_box_2 (which is in room_3) or to an empty position. So maybe before proceeding to blue_ball_1, the agent needs to go to green_box_2 or empty. Let's see: the constraint says if in room_3 in some state, there must be an earlier state where they were in front of green_box_2 or empty. So when the agent first arrives in room_3, they need to have a prior state where they were in front of green_box_2 (but they were in room_4 before, so that's not possible) or in front of empty. So perhaps after entering room_3, they need to gotoempty, which would satisfy that condition. Then later when they are in room_3 again (if needed), the prior state of being in front of empty would suffice.

So steps:

After entering room_3:

gotoempty (room_3). Then later, when moving to blue_ball_1, they can do gotoobject blue_ball_1. That way, when they are in room_3 (during the gotoempty and gotoobject steps), the first time they entered room_3 and did gotoempty would satisfy the condition that if they are in room_3, there was an earlier state (the gotoempty) where they were in front of empty.

Then, after that, they can gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_3, which would make them in front of it, achieving the goal.

But also, there's the constraint about being in front of purple_door_1 at least once. Purple_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3. Since the agent can't enter room_1, they can only approach it from room_3's side. So to be in front of purple_door_1, the agent needs to be in room_3 and go to that door. But since purple_door_1 is locked and must stay locked (constraint 1), the agent can't toggle it. But they just need to be in front of it. So after arriving in room_3, the agent can go to purple_door_1 (gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_1). Then they are in front of it. But to do that, they need to be in room_3. Then, the constraint for being in front of purple_door_1 requires that in an earlier state, they were in front of green_box_2 (in room_3) or in room_4. Since they came from room_4, the prior state of being in room_4 would satisfy that.

So the plan would need to include:

After entering room_3, go to purple_door_1 (from room_3), then perhaps proceed to get the blue_ball_1.

But also, after being in room_3, the agent needs to get back to room_2 at some point to satisfy the constraint that they are in room_2 at least once (which they already were, but maybe they have to return). Wait, the agent starts in room_2 and has already visited it. But the constraint says "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'you are in room_2'". Since the initial state is room_2, that's already satisfied. However, the agent might leave room_2 and need to return. But if the plan doesn't require returning, maybe that's okay. Wait, no, because the agent starts in room_2, so the initial state counts. So that constraint is already satisfied. But the other constraint is that if the agent is in room_2 (in any state), then either they are in front of yellow_ball_1 (which is in room_1, impossible) or holding blue_box_1. So whenever the agent is in room_2 after the initial state, they must be holding blue_box_1. Since blue_box_1 is in room_4. So if the agent returns to room_2 after picking up blue_box_1, that's okay. But the plan as initially thought (going to room_3 via room_4 and then to room_3) doesn't involve returning to room_2. So the agent would end up in room_3, in front of blue_ball_1. But the constraint about room_2 is already satisfied by the initial state. Wait, the constraint says "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'you are in room_2'". Since the initial state is room_2, that's covered. But the other constraint is that whenever the agent is in room_2, they must have in that state or a later state either in front of yellow_ball_1 (impossible) or holding blue_box_1. So if the agent ever is in room_2 again, they need to have blue_box_1. So the agent must not return to room_2 unless they are holding blue_box_1. But the plan as outlined doesn't require returning to room_2. So if the agent's path is room_2 -> room_4 -> room_3, and stays there, then the only time they are in room_2 is the initial state, which is okay. Because the constraint is that if they are in room_2 in some state s, then in s or a later state, they must be holding blue_box_1. Since in the initial state, they are not holding it, but the initial state is room_2. So this would violate the constraint. Wait, no. The constraint says: If the agent is in room_2 in some state s, then in s or a later state, they must be in front of yellow_ball_1 or holding blue_box_1. In the initial state, they are in room_2 and not holding blue_box_1. But yellow_ball_1 is in room_1, which they can't access. So this violates the constraint. Because the initial state is room_2, but they don't satisfy the required condition. So the initial state is invalid? Wait, no. The initial state is part of the problem. Wait, the constraints are that in every state where the agent is in room_2, they must, in that state or a later one, satisfy the condition. But the initial state is room_2, and the agent is not holding blue_box_1. So the agent must, in some subsequent state, hold blue_box_1. But the goal is to be in front of blue_ball_1 in room_3. So the plan must include picking up blue_box_1 at some point. Because even if they leave room_2 and never return, the initial state's condition must be addressed. Because the constraint is that whenever the agent is in room_2 (including the initial state), then in that state or a later state, they must have the condition. So the initial state is room_2. Therefore, at some point after the initial state, the agent must hold blue_box_1. So the plan must include acquiring blue_box_1. But blue_box_1 is in room_4. So the agent needs to go to room_4, pick up blue_box_1, then perhaps carry it to room_3, but since the goal doesn't require that, but the constraint requires that after being in room_2 (the initial state), they must hold blue_box_1 at some later state. So even if they are never in room_2 again, the initial state's requirement is that in the initial state or later, they hold blue_box_1. Since the initial state is room_2, the agent must hold blue_box_1 in some subsequent state. So the plan must include picking up blue_box_1. But blue_box_1 is in room_4. So the agent needs to go to room_4, pick it up, then proceed to room_3. But then, after picking it up, they can drop it somewhere, but the constraint just requires that at some state after the initial state, they hold blue_box_1. So even if they drop it later, as long as they picked it up once, that would satisfy the constraint. Because the condition is "at least one of the following conditions is true: ... in s or after s". So holding blue_box_1 at any point after the initial state would satisfy the requirement for the initial state's room_2 presence.

So the agent must pick up blue_box_1 at some point. So the plan must include going to room_4, picking up blue_box_1, then proceeding to room_3. Let's adjust the steps:

From room_2:

1. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4 (precondition: in room_2, door connects, no block)
2. toggle green_door_1 (unlock)
3. gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1 (now in room_4)
4. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_4 (precondition: in room_4)
5. pick blue_box_1 room_4 (now holding it)
6. Now need to go to room_3. But room_4 is connected to room_3 via yellow_door_2, which is locked. So need to unlock it.
7. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_3
8. toggle yellow_door_2 (unlock)
9. gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_2 (now in room_3)
10. Now, need to handle the constraint when entering room_3: before being in room_3, have been in front of green_box_2 or empty. So when arriving in room_3, the agent is not in front of anything. So perhaps after entering, they need to gotoempty or goto green_box_2. Let's say they gotoempty in room_3.
11. gotoempty (room_3)
12. Then, go to purple_door_1 to satisfy the constraint of being in front of it.
13. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_1 (since purple_door_1 connects room_3 and room_1)
14. Now, being in front of purple_door_1. The constraint here is that there must be an earlier state where they were in front of green_box_2 (in room_3) or in room_4. Since they were in room_4 before step 9, that's satisfied.
15. Now, proceed to get the blue_ball_1.
16. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_3
17. Now, the agent is in front of blue_ball_1, which is blue, satisfying the goal.

But wait, after step 5, the agent is holding blue_box_1. So the constraint for room_2 (the initial state) is satisfied because in a later state (step 5), the agent is holding blue_box_1.

Now, check all constraints:

1. Purple_door_1 remains locked: yes, because we never toggled it.
2. Agent never in room_1: correct.
3. Agent is in room_3: steps 9 and onwards.
4. When in room_3 (steps 9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17), the prior state (step 10: gotoempty) satisfies the condition of being in front of empty.
5. Agent was in room_2 initially: yes.
6. For the initial room_2 state: in a later state (step5), agent holds blue_box_1, satisfying the condition.
7. Agent is in front of purple_door_1: step13.
8. When in front of purple_door_1 (step13), prior state includes being in room_4 (step3-9), which satisfies the condition.

This seems to cover all constraints. Now, check the action sequence for validity:

Starting in room_2.

1. goto door green_door_1 (room2 to room4 door)
   - Precondition: in room_2, door connects, no block. Correct.
2. toggle green_door_1 (unlock)
   - Precondition: in front of door. After step1, agent is in front of green_door_1. Correct.
3. goto room room_2 to room_4 via green_door_1.
   - Pre: door is unlocked (after toggle), correct.
   - Now in room4, not in front of anything.
4. gotoobject blue_box_1 in room4.
   - Pre: in room4. Correct.
5. pick blue_box_1 in room4.
   - Pre: in same room, not holding anything. Correct. Now holding blue_box_1.
6. goto door yellow_door_2 in room4.
   - Pre: in room4, door connects to room3. Correct.
7. toggle yellow_door_2 (unlock)
   - Pre: in front of door. Correct.
8. goto room4 to room3 via yellow_door_2.
   - Door is unlocked. Correct. Now in room3.
9. gotoempty in room3.
   - Pre: allowed. Now in front of empty.
10. goto door purple_door_1 in room3.
    - Pre: in room3, door connects to room1. Correct. No block.
11. toggle not needed, just need to be in front. But no action here; the step is gotodoor.
    - After step10, agent is in front of purple_door_1. Satisfies the constraint of being in front of it.
12. Now need to get to blue_ball_1. So:
    gotoobject blue_ball_1 room3.
    - Pre: in room3. Correct.
13. Now in front of blue_ball_1. Goal achieved.

Wait, but the drop action isn't needed here. The goal is to be in front of a blue ball. The blue_ball_1 is already in room3. So if the agent is in front of it, that's sufficient. So after step12 (which is gotoobject blue_ball_1), the goal is met.

But the agent is holding blue_box_1 from step5. So when they pick up blue_box_1, they need to drop it if they need to pick up the ball. Wait, the goal doesn't require holding the ball, just being in front of it. So the agent can be holding blue_box_1 and be in front of blue_ball_1. But the problem is that the "pick" action requires that the agent isn't holding anything. So after picking blue_box_1, they can't pick the ball unless they drop the box. But the goal doesn't require picking the ball, just being in front of it. So the plan can end with the agent in front of blue_ball_1, holding blue_box_1. That's acceptable.

So the sequence would be:

1. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4
2. toggle green_door_1
3. gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1
4. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_4
5. pick blue_box_1 room_4
6. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_3
7. toggle yellow_door_2
8. gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_2
9. gotoempty
10. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_1
11. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_3

Wait, but after step8, agent is in room3. Then step9 is gotoempty (room3), step10 is gotodoor purple_door_1 (room3), step11 is gotoobject blue_ball_1 (room3).

But when in room3 after step8, the agent is not in front of any object. So step9 (gotoempty) is allowed. Then step10 (gotodoor) is allowed. Then step11 (gotoobject) requires being in the same room as the object (yes, room3) and not holding anything. Wait, but in step5, the agent picked up blue_box_1, and hasn't dropped it. So they are holding it. So the preconditions for gotoobject blue_ball_1 are met (same room), but for pick, they need to not be holding anything. But here, we're just going to the object, not picking it up. The "gotoobject" action's preconditions are only that you are in the same room as the object. So even if holding something, you can gotoobject. So step11 is valid. The agent is in room3, so can gotoobject blue_ball_1. Then the final state is being in front of blue_ball_1, holding blue_box_1. The goal is satisfied.

Now, check constraints again:

- The purple_door_1 is locked throughout. Yes, because we never toggled it.
- Agent never in room_1. Correct.
- Agent in room_3 (steps8-11). Check.
- When in room3 (steps8-11), there was an earlier state (step9) where they were in front of empty. Check.
- Agent was in room_2 (initial state and steps1-3). Check.
- The initial state requires that after being in room_2, agent holds blue_box_1. They do in step5. Check.
- Agent is in front of purple_door_1 in step10. Check.
- For step10, earlier state of being in room4 (steps3-8) satisfies the condition. Check.

This plan seems to satisfy all constraints and the goal. Let me count the steps again to ensure:

1. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4
2. toggle green_door_1
3. gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1
4. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_4
5. pick blue_box_1 room_4
6. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_3
7. toggle yellow_door_2
8. gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_2
9. gotoempty
10. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_1
11. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_3

Yes. Now, is there a shorter plan? For example, after step5, could the agent drop the box to pick up the ball, but the goal doesn't require picking up the ball. So being in front of it is enough. So this plan is optimal as it's 11 steps. Let's see if any steps can be skipped.

Wait, after step5, the agent is holding blue_box_1. To go to room3, they need to unlock yellow_door_2. So steps6-8 are needed. Then in room3, steps9-11 are needed. Is there a way to avoid step9 (gotoempty)? For example, if after entering room3, they first go to purple_door_1, but then they need to have been in front of green_box_2 or empty earlier. So if they first go to purple_door_1 (step10), then the prior state of being in room4 satisfies the constraint for step10 (earlier state in room4). However, when they first enter room3 (step8), they are in room3. The constraint says that if they are in room3 in any state, there must be an earlier state where they were in front of green_box_2 or empty. So when they first enter room3 (step8), that state's "in room3" requires that before that, there was a state where they were in front of green_box_2 or empty. But before step8, they were in room4. So the prior states are steps1-8. So the first time they are in room3 is step8. Therefore, they need to have, before step8, been in front of green_box_2 (which is in room3) or empty. But before step8, they were in room4. So they couldn't have been in front of green_box_2 (which is in room3). So the first time they are in room3 (step8), the only way to satisfy the constraint is to have been in front of empty in room4 before. But in step8, they were in room4, then goto room3. Before that, in room4, they were in front of yellow_door_2 (step6-7). So the first time they are in room3 (step8), there's no prior state where they were in front of green_box_2 or empty. Thus, the plan as written includes step9 (gotoempty) after entering room3, which allows the constraint to be satisfied. So step9 is necessary.

So the steps are necessary. Is there a way to combine steps? For example, after step8 (in room3), immediately goto purple_door_1. But then, when in room3 (step8), the constraint requires that before that, they were in front of green_box_2 or empty. Since before step8, they were in room4, which doesn't have green_box_2, they need to have a step in room3 where they are in front of empty. So step9 is necessary. Thus, the plan as outlined is correct.
