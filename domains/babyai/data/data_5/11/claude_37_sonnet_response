Let me analyze this problem step-by-step:

**Initial State:**
- I am in room_2
- Green box 1 and Yellow ball 1 are in room_1
- Purple box 1 is in room_2
- Blue ball 1, Green box 2, and Yellow ball 2 are in room_3
- Purple box 2 and Blue box 1 are in room_4
- All doors are locked (yellow_door_1, purple_door_1, green_door_1, yellow_door_2)
- My hands are empty
- I have visited room_2

**Goal:**
- Be in front of the blue ball (which is blue_ball_1 in room_3)

**Constraints:**
1. Purple door 1 must always remain locked
2. I can never be in room_1
3. I must visit room_3 at some point
4. Before being in room_3, I must have been in front of green_box_2 or in front of an empty position
5. I must visit room_2 at some point (I start there, so this is already satisfied)
6. After being in room_2, at some point I must be in front of yellow_ball_1 or holding blue_box_1
7. I must be in front of purple_door_1 at some point
8. Before being in front of purple_door_1, I must have been in front of green_box_2 or in room_4

**Door Connections:**
- Room 1 and Room 2 connected by yellow_door_1
- Room 1 and Room 3 connected by purple_door_1
- Room 2 and Room 4 connected by green_door_1
- Room 3 and Room 4 connected by yellow_door_2

Let me think about the structure of the gridworld:
```
+-------+-------+
| room_1 | room_3 |
+-------+-------+
| room_2 | room_4 |
+-------+-------+
```

Now, let me think about a plan:

1. Due to constraint 2, I can never be in room_1
2. Due to constraint 1, purple_door_1 must always remain locked
3. I need to reach blue_ball_1 which is in room_3
4. To get to room_3, I need to either:
   - Go from room_1 via purple_door_1 (but I can't be in room_1)
   - Go from room_4 via yellow_door_2

So the only viable path to room_3 is from room_4 via yellow_door_2.

To get to room_4 from my starting point (room_2), I need to use green_door_1.

Before I can enter room_3, I need to satisfy constraint 4: be in front of green_box_2 or in front of an empty position. green_box_2 is in room_3, so I need to be in front of an empty position before entering room_3.

Before being in front of purple_door_1, I need to satisfy constraint 8: be in front of green_box_2 or in room_4. Since I need to go to room_4 anyway, this constraint will be satisfied.

After being in room_2, I need to satisfy constraint 6: be in front of yellow_ball_1 or holding blue_box_1. yellow_ball_1 is in room_1, but I can't go to room_1. blue_box_1 is in room_4, so I'll need to pick that up.

Let me plan a path:

1. Start in room_2
2. Unlock green_door_1 to get to room_4
3. In room_4, go to blue_box_1 and pick it up (satisfying constraint 6)
4. Go to purple_door_1 (satisfying constraint 7)
5. Before entering room_3, go to an empty position (satisfying constraint 4)
6. Unlock yellow_door_2 and go to room_3
7. Go to blue_ball_1 to achieve the goal

Let me code this plan:

Wait, I think I missed an important detail. Let me review the layout again:

- Room 1 and Room 2 connected by yellow_door_1
- Room 1 and Room 3 connected by purple_door_1
- Room 2 and Room 4 connected by green_door_1
- Room 3 and Room 4 connected by yellow_door_2

Actually, purple_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3, not room_2 and room_3 as I initially thought. So I need to figure out how to be in front of purple_door_1 without being in room_1 (which I'm not allowed to enter).

Let me re-examine the constraints:

7. I must be in front of purple_door_1 at some point
8. Before being in front of purple_door_1, I must have been in front of green_box_2 or in room_4

From the layout, purple_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3. To be in front of a door, I need to be in one of the rooms it connects. Since I can't be in room_1 (constraint 2), I must be in room_3 to be in front of purple_door_1.

So the sequence would be:
1. Start in room_2
2. Unlock green_door_1 to get to room_4
3. In room_4, pick up blue_box_1 (to satisfy constraint 6)
4. Unlock yellow_door_2 and go to room_3
5. Before doing this, I need to satisfy constraint 4: be in front of green_box_2 or an empty position
6. Once in room_3, go in front of green_box_2 (to satisfy constraint 8)
7. Then go in front of purple_door_1 (to satisfy constraint 7)
8. Finally, go to blue_ball_1 to achieve the goal

Let me code this plan:

But wait, the constraint 8 says "Before being in front of purple_door_1, I must have been in front of green_box_2 or in room_4". So if I'm already in room_4, I don't need to go in front of green_box_2.

Let me revise the plan:

1. Start in room_2
2. Go in front of an empty position (to satisfy constraint 4 for later)
3. Go in front of green_door_1
4. Unlock green_door_1
5. Go to room_4 from room_2 via green_door_1 (this satisfies constraint 8 for later)
6. In room_4, go to blue_box_1 and pick it up (to satisfy constraint 6)
7. Go in front of yellow_door_2
8. Unlock yellow_door_2
9. Go to room_3 from room_4 via yellow_door_2
10. In room_3, go in front of purple_door_1 (satisfying constraint 7)
11. Go to blue_ball_1 to achieve the goal

Let me code this plan step by step:

```
gotoempty
gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4
toggle green_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1
gotoobject blue_box_1 room_4
pick blue_box_1 room_4
gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_3
toggle yellow_door_2
gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_2
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_1
gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_3
```

Let me double-check if this plan satisfies all constraints:

1. ✓ Purple door 1 remains locked (I never toggle it)
2. ✓ I never enter room_1
3. ✓ I visit room_3 (steps 9-11)
4. ✓ Before being in room_3, I am in front of an empty position (step 1)
5. ✓ I visit room_2 (I start there)
6. ✓ After being in room_2, I hold blue_box_1 (step 6)
7. ✓ I go in front of purple_door_1 (step 10)
8. ✓ Before being in front of purple_door_1, I am in room_4 (steps 4-9)

Hmm, I'm not sure if constraint 6 is satisfied correctly. The constraint says: "If expression 'you are in room_2' holds in some state s, then expression 'At least one of the following conditions is true: "you are in front of yellow_ball_1", "you are holding blue_box_1"' must hold at s or at some state after s".

I am holding blue_box_1 after step 6, which is after I've been in room_2, so I think this constraint is satisfied.

However, there's another issue: at the end, I'm still holding blue_box_1, and my goal is to be in front of blue_ball_1. According to the precondition for "gotoobject", I need to be in the same room as the object. Since blue_ball_1 is in room_3 and I do go to room_3, this should be fine.

However, I might need to drop blue_box_1 to be truly "in front of" blue_ball_1, since the problem description mentions that I can't be in front of something if I'm already in front of something else (and being in front of what I'm holding might count). Let me drop blue_box_1 before going to blue_ball_1 to be safe.

```
gotoempty
gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4
toggle green_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1
gotoobject blue_box_1 room_4
pick blue_box_1 room_4
gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_3
toggle yellow_door_2
gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_2
gotoempty
drop blue_box_1 room_3
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_1
gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_3
```

Wait, I don't think that after I pick blue_box_1, I'm "in front of" it; I'm holding it. So I don't need to drop it before going in front of something else. Let me revise again.

Actually, let me carefully read the effects of the "pick" action: "After performing this action regarding an object x, (i) you are no longer in front of x, (ii) your hands are no longer empty, (iii) you are carrying x, (iv) x is no longer in the room, and (v) if x was blocking some door, then it is no longer blocking that door."

So after picking up blue_box_1, I am not in front of it anymore. So I should be able to go in front of purple_door_1 and blue_ball_1 while still holding blue_box_1.

Let me revise my plan again to make sure it's correct:

```
gotoempty
gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4
toggle green_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1
gotoobject blue_box_1 room_4
pick blue_box_1 room_4
gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_3
toggle yellow_door_2
gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_2
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_1
gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_3
```

However, this doesn't work either, because according to the "gotoobject" precondition, I can only go in front of an object if I'm in the same room as it. Since I'm holding blue_box_1, it's no longer in any room, so I can't go in front of it.

Actually, it seems like the precondition for "gotoobject" just requires me to be in the same room as the object I want to go in front of, not that I'm not holding anything. So I should be able to go in front of blue_ball_1 while holding blue_box_1.

But let's carefully check once more. The precondition for "gotoobject" says: "you may only go in front of an object x if you are in the same room as x." Since blue_ball_1 is in room_3 and I'll be in room_3, this should be fine.

Now, the goal is to be "in front of" blue_ball_1. Let me check if being in front of something is affected by whether I'm holding something else. The effects of "gotoobject" include: "(i) if you were in front of some object or door x0, then you are no longer in front of x0 and (ii) you are in front of object x."

So it seems that I can only be in front of one thing at a time, but whether I'm holding something or not doesn't affect whether I can be in front of something else.

Given all this, I believe my plan is correct. Let me finalize it:

```
gotoempty
gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4
toggle green_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1
gotoobject blue_box_1 room_4
pick blue_box_1 room_4
gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_3
toggle yellow_door_2
gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_2
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_1
gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_3
```

But wait, I think there's a complication. The constraint 6 says "after being in room_2, at some point I must be in front of yellow_ball_1 or holding blue_box_1". The issue is that yellow_ball_1 is in room_1, and I can't go to room_1 (constraint 2).

So I must satisfy this constraint by holding blue_box_1. This is fine, since my plan involves picking up blue_box_1. But, what if later in the plan I'm not holding it anymore?

After review, I think my plan is still correct:
1. I start in room_2.
2. Later, I pick up blue_box_1 in room_4, satisfying constraint 6.
3. I do not drop blue_box_1 at any point, so constraint 6 remains satisfied.

Actually, I'm not sure if I can be in front of purple_door_1 while in room_3. Let's check the description again: the purple_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3. To be in front of a door, I need to be in one of the rooms it connects. So, if I'm in room_3, I can be in front of purple_door_1 (assuming there's no object blocking it, which there isn't).

Let me check if you can be in front of a door in a room you've entered through another door: "goto door: you may only go in front of a door d if (i) you are in a room which door d is connecting with another room, and (ii) there is no object blocking the position in front of d in the room you are currently in."

So this precondition just requires that I'm in a room that the door connects, and that the position in front of the door isn't blocked. Since purple_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3, and I'll be in room_3, I can go in front of purple_door_1.

I think my plan is correct and satisfies all constraints. Here's the finalized plan:

```
gotoempty
gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4
toggle green_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1
gotoobject blue_box_1 room_4
pick blue_box_1 room_4
gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_3
toggle yellow_door_2
gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_2
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_1
gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_3
```

Let me check once more if this plan satisfies all constraints:

1. ✓ Purple door 1 remains locked (I never toggle it)
2. ✓ I never enter room_1
3. ✓ I visit room_3 (steps 9-11)
4. ✓ Before being in room_3, I am in front of an empty position (step 1)
5. ✓ I visit room_2 (I start there)
6. ✓ After being in room_2, I hold blue_box_1 (step 6 onwards)
7. ✓ I go in front of purple_door_1 (step 10)
8. ✓ Before being in front of purple_door_1, I am in room_4 (steps 4-9)

Wait, let's double-check constraint 4 again: "If expression 'you are in room_3' holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: 'At least one of the following conditions is true: "you are in front of green_box_2", "you are in front of empty"'".

In my plan, I go in front of an empty position in step 1, which is before I enter room_3 in step 9, so this constraint is satisfied.

I think my plan is correct and satisfies all constraints. Here's the finalized plan:

```
gotoempty
gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_4
toggle green_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_4 green_door_1
gotoobject blue_box_1 room_4
pick blue_box_1 room_4
gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_3
toggle yellow_door_2
gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_2
gotodoor purple_door_1 room_3 room_1
gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_3
```

This is our final plan.
