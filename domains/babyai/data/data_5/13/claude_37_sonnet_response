Let me analyze this complex planning problem step by step.

First, let's understand the initial state:
- I am in room_2
- There are various boxes and balls distributed across the rooms
- All doors (blue_door_1, blue_door_2, blue_door_3, green_door_1) are locked
- I'm not holding any object
- I have only visited room_2 so far

The goal is:
- To have purple_ball_1 in room_4
- To be in room_4 myself
- To be in front of purple_ball_1

Let's also understand the constraints:
1. At some point, I must be in front of green_door_1
2. At some point, I must be in room_4
3. Before going to room_4, I must either be in room_1 or be holding purple_ball_1
4. blue_door_3 must always be locked
5. At some point, I must be in front of purple_ball_1
6. Before being in front of purple_ball_1, I must either be holding some object or blue_door_2 must be unlocked
7. At some point, I must be holding purple_ball_1 or some other object

Now, given these constraints, let's determine where purple_ball_1 is in the initial state: it's in room_4.

So I need to:
1. Get to room_4 where purple_ball_1 is (but before that, I must either visit room_1 or be holding purple_ball_1)
2. Be in front of purple_ball_1 (but before that, I must either hold an object or unlock blue_door_2)
3. I can't use blue_door_3 to get to room_4 because it must remain locked

Let me think about the possible paths:
- I'm in room_2
- I could go to room_1 via blue_door_1 (need to unlock it)
- From room_1, I could go to room_3 via blue_door_2 (need to unlock it)
- From room_3, I could go to room_4 via green_door_1 (need to unlock it)
- I also need to satisfy constraint 6, which means before being in front of purple_ball_1, I need to either hold an object or unlock blue_door_2

Let me plan:

1. In room_2, I'll pick up some object (maybe grey_box_2 or grey_box_3) to satisfy constraint 7 and to later satisfy constraint 6
2. Unlock blue_door_1 to go to room_1 (this satisfies part of constraint 3)
3. Go to room_1
4. Unlock blue_door_2
5. Go to room_3 via blue_door_2
6. Go in front of green_door_1 (satisfying constraint 1)
7. Unlock green_door_1
8. Go to room_4 via green_door_1 (satisfying constraint 2)
9. Drop the object I'm holding
10. Go to purple_ball_1 (satisfying constraint 5)
11. Be in front of purple_ball_1 in room_4 (satisfying the goal)

This plan should work and satisfy all constraints. Let me put it in the required format:

Actually, let me double-check one thing. For constraint 6, I need to either be holding some object or have blue_door_2 unlocked before I'm in front of purple_ball_1. In my plan, I'll be holding an object and I'll unlock blue_door_2, so either way, this constraint is satisfied.

For constraint 3, I need to either be in room_1 or be holding purple_ball_1 before going to room_4. In my plan, I'll be in room_1, so this constraint is satisfied.

Now, I'm still not sure this plan works because:
- purple_ball_1 is in room_4 initially
- To get to room_4, I need to use green_door_1 since blue_door_3 must remain locked
- Before going to room_4, I need to either be in room_1 or be holding purple_ball_1
- But purple_ball_1 is already in room_4, so I can't pick it up before going to room_4

I need to revise my plan. Let me think about this differently:

Actually, let me reread the constraint more carefully. Before I enter room_4, I must either have been in room_1 at some earlier point OR I must be holding purple_ball_1. So, if I go to room_1 first, I can then go to room_4 without needing to hold purple_ball_1.

Let me revise my plan:

1. In room_2, go to grey_box_2 or grey_box_3
2. Pick up one of these boxes to satisfy constraint 7 and to later satisfy constraint 6
3. Go to blue_door_1
4. Unlock blue_door_1
5. Go to room_1 via blue_door_1 (satisfying part of constraint 3)
6. Go to blue_door_2
7. Unlock blue_door_2 (satisfying part of constraint 6)
8. Go to room_3 via blue_door_2
9. Go to green_door_1 (satisfying constraint 1)
10. Unlock green_door_1
11. Go to room_4 via green_door_1 (satisfying constraint 2)
12. Drop the object I'm holding
13. Go to purple_ball_1 (satisfying constraint 5)
14. Be in front of purple_ball_1 in room_4 (satisfying the goal)

Now, let me write out the detailed actions:

```
gotoobject grey_box_2 room_2
pick grey_box_2 room_2
gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1
toggle blue_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_1 blue_door_1
gotodoor blue_door_2 room_1 room_3
toggle blue_door_2
gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_2
gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4
toggle green_door_1
gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_1
gotoempty
drop grey_box_2 room_4
gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4
```

Wait, I just realized that I'm not sure if the "gotoempty" action works right. Let me think about this more carefully.

Reading the description of the "drop" action again, it says:
"drop": you may only drop an object x if (i) you are currently holding x, and (ii) the position in front of you is empty.

So, I need to go to an empty position before dropping the object. Let me adjust my plan:

```
gotoobject grey_box_2 room_2
pick grey_box_2 room_2
gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1
toggle blue_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_1 blue_door_1
gotodoor blue_door_2 room_1 room_3
toggle blue_door_2
gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_2
gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4
toggle green_door_1
gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_1
gotoempty
drop grey_box_2 room_4
gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4
```

Actually, I'm not sure if I need to explicitly "gotoempty" after changing rooms, as the description of "gotoroom" says: "if you were in front of some object or door x0, then you are no longer in front of x0." This implies that after going to a new room, I'm not in front of anything.

But let's keep the "gotoempty" action to be safe, especially since I need to drop the box I'm holding.

Let me also double-check if this plan satisfies all the constraints:

1. "At some point, I must be in front of green_door_1" - Yes, in the action: gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4
2. "At some point, I must be in room_4" - Yes, after the action: gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_1
3. "Before going to room_4, I must either be in room_1 or be holding purple_ball_1" - Yes, I'll be in room_1 after the action: gotoroom room_2 room_1 blue_door_1
4. "blue_door_3 must always be locked" - Yes, I never unlock blue_door_3 in my plan
5. "At some point, I must be in front of purple_ball_1" - Yes, in the action: gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4
6. "Before being in front of purple_ball_1, I must either be holding some object or blue_door_2 must be unlocked" - Yes, I unlock blue_door_2 in the action: toggle blue_door_2
7. "At some point, I must be holding purple_ball_1 or some other object" - Yes, I'll be holding grey_box_2 after the action: pick grey_box_2 room_2

I think this plan should work and satisfy all the constraints. Let me finalize it:

```
gotoobject grey_box_2 room_2
pick grey_box_2 room_2
gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1
toggle blue_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_1 blue_door_1
gotodoor blue_door_2 room_1 room_3
toggle blue_door_2
gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_2
gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4
toggle green_door_1
gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_1
gotoempty
drop grey_box_2 room_4
gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4
```

Now, let me double-check if I'm missing anything or if there's a more optimal plan.

Actually, constraint 6 says: "Before being in front of purple_ball_1, I must either be holding some object or blue_door_2 must be unlocked". 

So, I just need to ensure that before I run the action "gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4", I either have an object in my hand or blue_door_2 is unlocked. In my plan, I'll have already unlocked blue_door_2, so this constraint will be satisfied.

Constraint 7 says: "At some point, I must be holding purple_ball_1 or some other object".

In my plan, I'll pick up grey_box_2, which is "some other object". So, constraint 7 is satisfied.

I think this plan is valid and optimal. Let me submit it:

```
gotoobject grey_box_2 room_2
pick grey_box_2 room_2
gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1
toggle blue_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_1 blue_door_1
gotodoor blue_door_2 room_1 room_3
toggle blue_door_2
gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_2
gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4
toggle green_door_1
gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_1
gotoempty
drop grey_box_2 room_4
gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4
```

Actually I just realized that I have one more constraint to check. The goal is: "There is a ball v such that "The following conditions are all true: "v is purple", "v is in room_4", "you are in room_4", "you are in front of v""".

In my plan, I end by going to purple_ball_1 in room_4, so this goal is satisfied.

Let's double-check the constraints one more time:

1. "At some point, I must be in front of green_door_1" - Yes, in the action: gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4
2. "At some point, I must be in room_4" - Yes, after the action: gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_1
3. "Before going to room_4, I must either be in room_1 or be holding purple_ball_1" - Yes, I'll be in room_1 after the action: gotoroom room_2 room_1 blue_door_1
4. "blue_door_3 must always be locked" - Yes, I never unlock blue_door_3 in my plan
5. "At some point, I must be in front of purple_ball_1" - Yes, in the action: gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4
6. "Before being in front of purple_ball_1, I must either be holding some object or blue_door_2 must be unlocked" - Yes, I unlock blue_door_2 in the action: toggle blue_door_2
7. "At some point, I must be holding purple_ball_1 or some other object" - Yes, I'll be holding grey_box_2 after the action: pick grey_box_2 room_2

I believe this plan is valid and optimal.

Actually, constraint 7 states: "The following expression must hold in at least one state: At least one of the following conditions is true: "you are holding purple_ball_1", "you are holding some object""".

This means I need to either hold purple_ball_1 or some other object at some point. Since purple_ball_1 is in room_4 and I need to be in room_1 before going to room_4, I'll hold grey_box_2 from room_2. This satisfies constraint 7.

I believe this plan is valid and optimal.

```
gotoobject grey_box_2 room_2
pick grey_box_2 room_2
gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1
toggle blue_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_1 blue_door_1
gotodoor blue_door_2 room_1 room_3
toggle blue_door_2
gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_2
gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4
toggle green_door_1
gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_1
gotoempty
drop grey_box_2 room_4
gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4
```

I'm satisfied with this plan and believe it's valid and optimal.

Wait, there's actually a simpler way to satisfy constraint 6: "Before being in front of purple_ball_1, I must either be holding some object or blue_door_2 must be unlocked". Since I'm going to be holding grey_box_2 before being in front of purple_ball_1, I satisfy the first part of the disjunction. 

However, I still need to unlock blue_door_2 to get to room_3 and then to room_4 using green_door_1. So, I'll still be satisfying both parts of the disjunction.

I'm satisfied with this plan and believe it's valid and optimal.

```
gotoobject grey_box_2 room_2
pick grey_box_2 room_2
gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1
toggle blue_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_1 blue_door_1
gotodoor blue_door_2 room_1 room_3
toggle blue_door_2
gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_2
gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4
toggle green_door_1
gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_1
gotoempty
drop grey_box_2 room_4
gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4
```

I'm satisfied with this plan and believe it's valid and optimal.

Another option might be to use grey_box_3 instead of grey_box_2, but since they're both in room_2, it doesn't change the plan's optimality. The only reason I would prefer grey_box_2 is if it's more accessible in room_2, but I don't have that information.

In conclusion, I believe this plan is valid and optimal.

Actually, I'm not sure if the effect of 'gotoroom' is that you end up in front of nothing, so you might need to 'gotoempty' afterwards. But I'll include it to be safe. 

```
gotoobject grey_box_2 room_2
pick grey_box_2 room_2
gotodoor blue_door_1 room_2 room_1
toggle blue_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_1 blue_door_1
gotodoor blue_door_2 room_1 room_3
toggle blue_door_2
gotoroom room_1 room_3 blue_door_2
gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4
toggle green_door_1
gotoroom room_3 room_4 green_door_1
gotoempty
drop grey_box_2 room_4
gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_4
```

I believe this plan is valid and optimal.
