Okay, let me try to figure out how to solve this planning problem. So, the goal is to get a grey ball into room_4, be in room_4, and be in front of that grey ball. The constraints are a bit tricky, so I need to make sure each one is satisfied.

First, the initial state: the agent is in room_2. The grey_ball_2 is already in room_4, so maybe that's the target. Wait, the goal says "there is a ball v such that v is grey, in room_4, you're in room_4, and in front of v." Since grey_ball_2 is already in room_4, maybe we just need to get to room_4 and be in front of it. But the initial state has all doors locked, so we need to unlock them.

Constraints to consider:

1. At least one state must have the agent holding blue_box_1 and purple_box_1 in room_4.
2. At least one state must have red_ball_1 in room_3 or the agent in front of blue_ball_1.
3. At least one state must have the agent in room_2.
4. If the agent is in room_2 in any state, then in that state or a subsequent one, they must be holding an object.
5. grey_door_1 must always be locked.
6. The agent must be in room_4 in some state.
7. If the agent is in room_4, then before that, either blue_box_1 was in room_3 or they were in front of yellow_door_1.

Starting with the doors: green_door_1 connects room_1 and 2, yellow_door_1 connects room_1 and 3, grey_door_1 connects 2 and 4, and yellow_door_2 connects 3 and 4. All doors are locked initially. The agent is in room_2.

To get to room_4, the direct path is via grey_door_1 from room_2. But constraint 5 says grey_door_1 must always be locked. So we can't use that door because to go through, it needs to be unlocked. So we can't toggle it open. Therefore, the agent must take a different route. The other path to room_4 is from room_3 via yellow_door_2. So the agent needs to go from room_2 to room_1 via green_door_1 (needs to unlock it), then room_1 to room_3 via yellow_door_1 (unlock that), then room_3 to room_4 via yellow_door_2 (unlock that). But wait, the initial positions of boxes and balls might block doors?

Wait, the preconditions for goto door require that there's no object blocking the position in front of the door in the current room. So, for example, if a box is in front of a door, the agent can't go there. Need to check where the objects are. Let's see:

In room_1: blue_box_1 and red_ball_1. In room_2: blue_ball_1, yellow_box_1. Room3: grey_box_1, purple_box_1, grey_ball_1. Room4: grey_ball_2. So, if any of these objects are in front of doors, they might block them. But the problem doesn't specify the positions of the objects relative to doors. Wait, the problem says "gotoobject x r" moves you in front of x in room r. So maybe the objects are not blocking the doors unless specified. The initial state doesn't mention any objects blocking doors. So I think doors are not blocked by objects initially. So maybe the agent can go to doors without moving objects first.

But let's proceed. To get to room_4, the agent can't use grey_door_1 because it must remain locked. So the path is room_2 → room_1 via green_door_1 (need to unlock it), then room_1 → room_3 via yellow_door_1 (unlock), then room_3 → room_4 via yellow_door_2 (unlock). Then in room_4, go to grey_ball_2.

But let's check the constraints:

Constraint 7: When the agent is in room_4, there must be a prior state where blue_box_1 is in room_3 or the agent was in front of yellow_door_1. So the agent needs to either move blue_box_1 to room_3 (but blue_box_1 is in room_1 initially) or be in front of yellow_door_1 (which is in room_1 and room_3). So perhaps when the agent goes through yellow_door_1 from room_1 to room_3, they would first go in front of yellow_door_1 in room_1, which would satisfy the condition.

Now, let's outline the steps:

1. From room_2, go to green_door_1 (since green_door_1 connects room_1 and 2). So action: gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_1. But preconditions: need to be in a room connected by the door. Since agent is in room_2, and green_door_1 connects room_2 and room_1, that's okay. Then toggle green_door_1 to unlock it. Then go to room_1 via green_door_1.

But wait, gotoroom takes you from r1 to r2 using door d. So to go from room_2 to room_1 via green_door_1, you need to first be in front of green_door_1. So steps:

- gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_1 (agent is now in front of green_door_1 in room_2)
- toggle green_door_1 (unlocks it)
- gotoroom room_2 room_1 green_door_1 (moves to room_1)

Now in room_1. Need to go to room_3 via yellow_door_1, which is locked. So:

- gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3
- toggle yellow_door_1 (unlock)
- gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1

Now in room_3. Then need to go to room_4 via yellow_door_2, which is locked.

- gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_3 room_4
- toggle yellow_door_2 (unlock)
- gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_2

Now in room_4. Then gotoobject grey_ball_2 room_4. But the agent is in room_4, so that's allowed. Then the goal is achieved.

But wait, the goal requires being in front of the grey ball in room_4, which is grey_ball_2. So the plan would be:

1. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_1
2. toggle green_door_1
3. gotoroom room_2 room_1 green_door_1
4. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3
5. toggle yellow_door_1
6. gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1
7. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_3 room_4
8. toggle yellow_door_2
9. gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_2
10. gotoobject grey_ball_2 room_4

But we need to check all constraints. Let's go through each constraint:

Constraint 1: At least one state where holding blue_box_1 and purple_box_1 is in room_4.

In the current plan, blue_box_1 is in room_1. To hold it, the agent would need to pick it up. But in the current plan, the agent never goes to room_1 except to pass through. So how to satisfy this constraint? The plan above doesn't involve picking up blue_box_1. So this constraint isn't met. So we need to adjust the plan.

So, the agent must at some point hold blue_box_1 and have purple_box_1 in room_4. Purple_box_1 is initially in room_3. To get it to room_4, the agent would need to pick it up in room_3, carry it to room_4, and drop it there.

But that would require:

In room_3, after arriving from room_1, the agent can gotoobject purple_box_1 room_3, pick it up, then proceed to room_4, drop it there. Then, after dropping, the purple_box_1 is in room_4. Also, the agent needs to hold blue_box_1 at some point. So perhaps after going to room_1, the agent can pick up blue_box_1, carry it around, and drop it somewhere.

But blue_box_1 is in room_1. Let's see:

From room_2, the agent goes to room_1. Then:

- gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1
- pick blue_box_1 room_1

Then, proceed to room_3. But holding blue_box_1, then go to room_3. Then, in room_3, pick up purple_box_1? No, can't pick up another object while holding one. So perhaps carry blue_box_1 to room_3, then drop it there. Then pick up purple_box_1 and take it to room_4.

But let's see:

After step 3 (in room_1), do:

4. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1
5. pick blue_box_1 room_1
6. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3
7. toggle yellow_door_1
8. gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1 (now in room_3, holding blue_box_1)
9. drop blue_box_1 room_3 (now blue_box_1 is in room_3)
10. gotoobject purple_box_1 room_3
11. pick purple_box_1 room_3
12. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_3 room_4
13. toggle yellow_door_2
14. gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_2 (now in room_4, holding purple_box_1)
15. drop purple_box_1 room_4 (now purple_box_1 is in room_4)

Then, at this point, the agent has satisfied the first constraint (holding blue_box_1 in some state when they picked it up, and purple_box_1 is in room_4 after being dropped there). So the state after step 15 includes purple_box_1 in room_4, and the agent held blue_box_1 in step 5. So the constraint is satisfied in step 5 (holding blue_box_1) and step 15 (purple_box_1 in room_4). Wait, but the constraint requires that in the same state both conditions are true: holding blue_box_1 and purple_box_1 is in room_4. But purple_box_1 is only in room_4 after step 15, and the agent is holding blue_box_1 in steps 5-8 (until they drop it). So the agent can't be holding blue_box_1 when purple_box_1 is in room_4. Therefore, the constraint requires that in at least one state, both conditions are true. But this isn't possible unless the agent is holding blue_box_1 while also having purple_box_1 in room_4. How?

Wait, maybe the agent can carry both boxes? But no, you can only hold one object at a time. So the only way is to have a state where the agent is holding blue_box_1 and purple_box_1 is in room_4. That would require that purple_box_1 is in room_4 while the agent is holding blue_box_1. But how? Since the agent can only carry one object at a time. So perhaps:

The agent picks up blue_box_1 in room_1, then carries it to room_3, drops it there (so blue_box_1 is in room_3). Then picks up purple_box_1 in room_3, carries it to room_4 and drops it (purple_box_1 in room_4). Then returns to room_3, picks up blue_box_1 again, and takes it somewhere. But then in the state where the agent is holding blue_box_1 again, purple_box_1 is already in room_4.

So for example:

After step 9 (drop blue_box_1 in room_3), steps 10-15 (pick purple, take to room4, drop). Then, to hold blue_box_1 again, the agent would need to go back to room3, pick it up. So steps 16-17: gotoobject blue_box_1 room3, pick. At this point, the agent is holding blue_box_1 and purple is in room4. So that state satisfies constraint 1.

But this adds more steps. Let me adjust the plan:

Original steps up to step 3 (agent in room1):

3. gotoroom room_2 room_1 green_door_1

Then:

4. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1
5. pick blue_box_1 room_1
6. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3
7. toggle yellow_door_1
8. gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1 (now in room3, holding blue_box_1)
9. drop blue_box_1 room_3
10. gotoobject purple_box_1 room3
11. pick purple_box_1 room3
12. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room3 room4
13. toggle yellow_door_2
14. gotoroom room3 room4 yellow_door_2 (now in room4, holding purple)
15. drop purple_box_1 room4 (now purple is in room4)
16. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room4 room3
17. toggle yellow_door_2 (maybe not necessary, but need to go back)
18. gotoroom room4 room3 yellow_door_2
19. gotoobject blue_box_1 room3
20. pick blue_box_1 room3

Now, in step 20, the agent is holding blue_box_1, and purple is in room4. So this state satisfies constraint 1. Then the agent can proceed to drop blue_box_1 somewhere else, but maybe that's unnecessary. But this adds a lot of steps. However, the problem requires an optimal plan (shortest possible). So perhaps there's a shorter way.

Wait, maybe the agent can carry blue_box_1 all the way to room4. Let's see:

After step 8 (in room3, holding blue_box_1), instead of dropping it, proceed to take it to room4. But to do that, need to go through yellow_door_2, which is locked. So:

8. gotoroom room_1 to room3, holding blue_box_1
9. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room3 room4
10. toggle yellow_door_2
11. gotoroom room3 room4 yellow_door_2 (now in room4, holding blue_box_1)
12. drop blue_box_1 room4 (now blue is in room4)
13. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room4 room3
14. toggle yellow_door_2 (maybe not needed)
15. gotoroom room4 room3 yellow_door_2 (back to room3)
16. gotoobject purple_box_1 room3
17. pick purple_box_1 room3
18. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room3 room4
19. toggle yellow_door_2
20. gotoroom room3 room4 yellow_door_2
21. drop purple_box_1 room4

Now, in this plan, when the agent is holding blue_box_1 (steps 5-11), purple_box_1 is still in room3. Then when the agent is holding purple_box_1 (steps17-20), blue_box_1 is in room4. So there's no state where both holding blue and purple is in room4. So this doesn't satisfy constraint 1. Hmm.

Alternative approach: Maybe the agent can move purple_box_1 to room4 first, then go back and get blue_box_1, but that would take even longer.

Alternatively, perhaps during the process of moving through rooms, the agent can drop blue_box_1 in room3, then take purple to room4, then return to room3, pick blue again, and then proceed to room4 again. Then, when holding blue_box_1 again, purple is in room4.

So steps:

In room3 after dropping blue_box_1 (step9):

10. pick purple, take to room4 (steps10-14)
15. drop purple in room4
16. return to room3 (steps15-17)
17. pick blue_box_1
18. then go back to room4 (steps18-20)
Now, in step17 (holding blue_box_1), purple is in room4. So step17 satisfies constraint1: holding blue_box_1 and purple in room4. So the state after step17 (picking up blue in room3) has agent holding blue_box_1 and purple in room4. So this satisfies the first constraint. Then the agent can proceed to room4 again, drop blue there, and then go to grey_ball_2.

But this seems like adding steps. But maybe it's necessary. Let's outline this plan:

1. gotodoor green_door_1 room2 room1
2. toggle green_door_1
3. gotoroom room2 room1 green_door_1
4. gotoobject blue_box_1 room1
5. pick blue_box_1 room1
6. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room1 room3
7. toggle yellow_door_1
8. gotoroom room1 room3 yellow_door_1 (now in room3, holding blue)
9. drop blue_box_1 room3 (blue in room3)
10. gotoobject purple_box_1 room3
11. pick purple_box_1 room3
12. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room3 room4
13. toggle yellow_door_2
14. gotoroom room3 room4 yellow_door_2 (now in room4, holding purple)
15. drop purple_box_1 room4 (purple in room4)
16. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room4 room3
17. toggle yellow_door_2 (unlock again if needed)
18. gotoroom room4 room3 yellow_door_2 (back to room3)
19. gotoobject blue_box_1 room3
20. pick blue_box_1 room3 (now holding blue, purple is in room4)
21. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room3 room4
22. toggle yellow_door_2
23. gotoroom room3 room4 yellow_door_2 (now in room4, holding blue)
24. drop blue_box_1 room4 (optional)
25. gotoobject grey_ball_2 room4

Now, in step20, the agent is holding blue_box_1, and purple is in room4. So this satisfies constraint1. Then, after that, the agent proceeds to room4 again, drops blue_box_1, and then goes to grey_ball_2. But this adds many steps. Is there a shorter way?

Alternatively, after step9 (blue in room3), when the agent takes purple to room4, then goes back to room3, picks blue, and then returns to room4. But the agent could just go back to room3 after dropping purple in room4, pick blue, and then go to room4 again. This would add steps but fulfill the constraint.

But the problem requires an optimal plan, so we need the shortest possible. Is there a way to fulfill all constraints with fewer steps?

Let's check constraint2: At least one state where red_ball_1 is in room3 or agent is in front of blue_ball_1. Initially, red_ball_1 is in room1. To move it to room3, the agent would need to pick it up and carry it. But that's time-consuming. Alternatively, being in front of blue_ball_1 (which is in room2). But the agent starts in room2, but blue_ball_1 is in room2. So if the agent, at some point, is in front of blue_ball_1 in room2, that would satisfy the constraint. But the agent starts in room2. To be in front of blue_ball_1, they could gotoobject blue_ball_1 room2 before leaving room2. But in the initial plan, the agent leaves room2 early. So perhaps adding a step in room2 to go in front of blue_ball_1 would satisfy constraint2.

For example, before leaving room2:

1. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room2 (satisfies constraint2)
2. gotodoor green_door_1 room2 room1
3. toggle green_door_1
4. gotoroom room2 room1 green_door_1
... then proceed as before.

This way, in step1, the agent is in front of blue_ball_1, which satisfies constraint2. So adding this step would handle that.

Constraint3: Agent must be in room_2 in at least one state. Since the agent starts in room2, that's already satisfied. So initial state counts, but the problem states that "you have visited room_2" is in the initial state. So the constraint is already satisfied.

Constraint4: If agent is in room2 in any state, then in that state or a subsequent one, they must be holding an object. The initial state is room2, and in the initial state, the agent isn't holding anything. So they must hold an object at some point after. But in the initial plan, the agent leaves room2 immediately. So if they are in room2 again, they need to hold an object. But if they don't return to room2, then the only state where they are in room2 is the initial state. So this requires that in the initial state or after, they hold an object. But the initial state has them not holding anything. So they must pick up an object after leaving room2. But according to the initial plan, the agent leaves room2 and never returns. So the constraint is satisfied if the agent picks up an object after leaving room2.

But in the initial plan, the agent picks up blue_box_1 in room1, which is after leaving room2. So constraint4 is satisfied because in the initial state (room2) they are not holding, but in subsequent states, they hold blue_box_1. So the constraint is satisfied because after being in room2 (initial state), they eventually hold an object.

Constraint5: grey_door_1 must always be locked. Since we're not using grey_door_1 at all, and it's initially locked, and no actions toggle it, this is satisfied.

Constraint6: Agent must be in room4. The plan gets them to room4, so that's okay.

Constraint7: When agent is in room4, there must be a prior state where blue_box_1 is in room3 or agent was in front of yellow_door_1. If the agent goes through yellow_door_1 (connecting room1 and room3), then before entering room3, they were in front of yellow_door_1 in room1. So when they are in room4, the prior state where they were in front of yellow_door_1 satisfies the condition. So in the plan where they go from room1 to room3 via yellow_door_1, they have to go in front of it, toggle it, then go through. So when they are in room4, they had a prior state (step4: gotodoor yellow_door_1 room1 room3) where they were in front of yellow_door_1, which satisfies constraint7.

So, integrating all these considerations, the plan needs to include:

- Go in front of blue_ball_1 in room2 to satisfy constraint2.
- Pick up blue_box_1 in room1 and drop it in room3, then pick it up again later while purple_box_1 is in room4 to satisfy constraint1.
- Ensure that after leaving room2, the agent picks up an object (blue_box_1) to satisfy constraint4.

But this seems to require many steps. Let me try to outline the optimal plan:

Steps:

1. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_2 (satisfies constraint2)
2. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_1
3. toggle green_door_1
4. gotoroom room_2 room_1 green_door_1 (now in room1)
5. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1
6. pick blue_box_1 room_1 (now holding it, satisfies constraint4)
7. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3
8. toggle yellow_door_1
9. gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1 (now in room3)
10. drop blue_box_1 room_3 (now blue is in room3)
11. gotoobject purple_box_1 room_3
12. pick purple_box_1 room_3
13. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_3 room_4
14. toggle yellow_door_2
15. gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_2 (now in room4)
16. drop purple_box_1 room_4 (purple in room4)
17. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_3
18. toggle yellow_door_2 (lock again? Not necessary, but need to go back)
19. gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_2 (back to room3)
20. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_3
21. pick blue_box_1 room_3 (now holding blue, purple in room4: satisfies constraint1)
22. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_3 room_4
23. toggle yellow_door_2
24. gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_2 (now in room4)
25. drop blue_box_1 room_4 (optional, but not needed for the goal)
26. gotoobject grey_ball_2 room_4 (achieves goal)

But this is a long plan. Can we make it shorter?

Alternatively, after step16 (drop purple in room4), the agent can go back to room3, pick blue_box_1, and then go to room4 again. But that adds steps. However, constraint1 requires that in some state, both conditions are true. The state where the agent picks blue_box_1 in room3 (step21) is such a state: holding blue_box_1 and purple_box_1 is in room4. So steps1-21-24-26.

But how to get to room4 and in front of grey_ball_2.

Alternatively, after step15 (in room4), drop purple (step16), then the agent is in room4. So steps1-16 would get the agent to room4 with purple there. Then, to satisfy the goal, they need to gotoobject grey_ball_2 room4. But the goal also requires being in room4 and in front of grey_ball_2. So steps1-16 plus:

17. gotoobject grey_ball_2 room4

But then constraint1 is not satisfied. Because in this plan, the agent holds blue_box_1 (step6) and later drops it in room3 (step10), then holds purple (step12-16). So when is blue_box_1 held and purple in room4? Only after step21 (picking blue again). But without steps17-24, the agent is already in room4 after step15. So perhaps steps:

1. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room2 (constraint2)
2. gotodoor green_door_1 room2 room1
3. toggle green_door_1
4. gotoroom room2 room1 green_door_1
5. gotoobject blue_box_1 room1
6. pick blue_box_1 (constraint4)
7. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room1 room3
8. toggle yellow_door_1
9. gotoroom room1 room3 yellow_door_1 (now in room3)
10. drop blue_box_1 room3
11. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room3 room4
12. toggle yellow_door_2
13. gotoroom room3 room4 yellow_door_2 (now in room4, constraint6)
14. gotoobject grey_ball_2 room4 (goal achieved)

But in this plan, when does purple_box_1 get to room4? It doesn't. So this plan doesn't satisfy constraint1. Therefore, the agent must move purple_box_1 to room4. So steps must include picking up purple in room3 and taking it to room4.

So:

After step9 (in room3):

10. gotoobject purple_box_1 room3
11. pick purple_box_1 room3
12. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room3 room4
13. toggle yellow_door_2
14. gotoroom room3 room4 yellow_door_2 (now in room4)
15. drop purple_box_1 room4
16. gotoobject grey_ball_2 room4

Now, this plan has the agent holding purple_box_1 from step11-15. Constraint1 requires holding blue_box_1 and purple in room4. But in this plan, the agent only holds blue_box_1 in steps6-10 (until dropping in room3). When purple is in room4 (step15), the agent is not holding blue_box_1. So constraint1 is not satisfied. Therefore, the agent must also hold blue_box_1 while purple is in room4.

To do that, after dropping purple in room4, the agent needs to go back to room3, pick up blue_box_1, and then go to room4 again. So steps:

15. drop purple_box_1 room4
16. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room4 room3
17. toggle yellow_door_2 (unlock again, but it's already unlocked)
18. gotoroom room4 room3 yellow_door_2 (back to room3)
19. gotoobject blue_box_1 room3
20. pick blue_box_1 room3 (now holding blue, purple in room4: satisfies constraint1)
21. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room3 room4
22. toggle yellow_door_2
23. gotoroom room3 room4 yellow_door_2 (now in room4)
24. drop blue_box_1 room4 (optional)
25. gotoobject grey_ball_2 room4

Now, step20 is when the agent is holding blue_box_1 and purple is in room4. So constraint1 is satisfied. This plan includes steps1-25. But this is quite long. Is there a way to optimize?

Wait, perhaps after dropping purple in room4 (step15), the agent can immediately go back to room3, pick blue, and return. But this adds steps. However, without this, constraint1 is not satisfied. So this seems necessary.

Another way to satisfy constraint1: The agent holds blue_box_1 in room4 while purple is there. But how? The agent would need to carry both boxes, which is impossible. So the only way is to have two separate instances where blue is held and purple is in room4.

Therefore, the optimal plan must include these steps. But maybe there's a shorter path. For example, after step14 (agent in room4 with purple), they can drop it, then go back to room3, pick blue, and return. But that's adding steps.

Alternatively, after step10 (blue in room3), the agent can pick up purple and take it to room4, then come back to room3, pick blue, and take it to room4, dropping it. But that's the same as before.

Alternatively, when the agent is in room1, they could take blue_box_1 to room4 via another path. But the only path is room1 → room3 → room4. So no shortcut.

Another thought: If the agent, when in room4 after step14, drops purple, then immediately returns to room3 and picks up blue, then goes back to room4, that adds steps but satisfies the constraint. So steps:

1. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room2 (step1)
2. gotodoor green_door_1 room2 room1 (step2)
3. toggle green_door_1 (step3)
4. gotoroom room2 room1 green_door_1 (step4)
5. gotoobject blue_box_1 room1 (step5)
6. pick blue_box_1 room1 (step6)
7. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room1 room3 (step7)
8. toggle yellow_door_1 (step8)
9. gotoroom room1 room3 yellow_door_1 (step9)
10. drop blue_box_1 room3 (step10)
11. gotoobject purple_box_1 room3 (step11)
12. pick purple_box_1 room3 (step12)
13. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room3 room4 (step13)
14. toggle yellow_door_2 (step14)
15. gotoroom room3 room4 yellow_door_2 (step15)
16. drop purple_box_1 room4 (step16)
17. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room4 room3 (step17)
18. gotoroom room4 room3 yellow_door_2 (step18)
19. gotoobject blue_box_1 room3 (step19)
20. pick blue_box_1 room3 (step20)
21. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room3 room4 (step21)
22. gotoroom room3 room4 yellow_door_2 (step22)
23. gotoobject grey_ball_2 room4 (step23)

But step21 requires toggling the door again. Wait, after step15, when the agent is in room4, yellow_door_2 is unlocked. When they go back to room3 (step17-18), the door is still unlocked. So they can just go through without toggling again. So step21 can be gotodoor yellow_door_2 room3 room4, then gotoroom. So steps:

After step18 (in room3):

19. gotoobject blue_box_1 room3
20. pick blue_box_1 room3
21. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room3 room4
22. gotoroom room3 room4 yellow_door_2 (since door is already unlocked)
23. gotoobject grey_ball_2 room4

Now, in step20, agent is holding blue_box_1, and purple is in room4 (step16). So constraint1 is satisfied. This reduces the steps. So the plan would be:

1. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_2
2. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_1
3. toggle green_door_1
4. gotoroom room_2 room_1 green_door_1
5. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1
6. pick blue_box_1 room_1
7. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3
8. toggle yellow_door_1
9. gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1
10. drop blue_box_1 room_3
11. gotoobject purple_box_1 room_3
12. pick purple_box_1 room_3
13. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_3 room_4
14. toggle yellow_door_2
15. gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_2
16. drop purple_box_1 room_4
17. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_3
18. gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_2
19. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_3
20. pick blue_box_1 room_3
21. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_3 room_4
22. gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_2
23. gotoobject grey_ball_2 room_4

This plan has 23 steps. But let's check all constraints again:

Constraint1: step20 (holding blue_box_1) and step16 (purple in room4). So in step20, purple is already in room4, so yes, this state satisfies both. So constraint1 is met.

Constraint2: step1 (in front of blue_ball_1), so yes.

Constraint3: initial state is room2, which is visited, so yes.

Constraint4: agent was in room2 in step1, and then in step6 picks up blue_box_1, so after step6, they are holding an object. So constraint4 is satisfied.

Constraint5: grey_door_1 remains locked throughout.

Constraint6: agent is in room4 in steps15-16, and later again.

Constraint7: when agent is in room4 (step15), the prior state where they were in front of yellow_door_1 is step7-8. So step7-8 (gotodoor yellow_door_1 room1 room3 and toggle) puts them in front of yellow_door_1. So this satisfies constraint7.

So this plan meets all constraints and is optimal. But can we make it shorter?

For example, after step16 (drop purple in room4), can the agent go directly to grey_ball_2 without returning for blue_box_1? But then constraint1 is not met. So no, that step is necessary.

Alternatively, after step6, when the agent is holding blue_box_1, can they take it all the way to room4?

Let's see:

1. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room2
2. gotodoor green_door_1 room2 room1
3. toggle green_door_1
4. gotoroom room2 room1 green_door_1
5. gotoobject blue_box_1 room1
6. pick blue_box_1
7. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room1 room3
8. toggle yellow_door_1
9. gotoroom room1 room3 yellow_door_1 (now in room3, holding blue)
10. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room3 room4
11. toggle yellow_door_2
12. gotoroom room3 room4 yellow_door_2 (now in room4, holding blue)
13. drop blue_box_1 room4 (blue in room4)
14. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room4 room3
15. gotoroom room4 room3 yellow_door_2
16. gotoobject purple_box_1 room3
17. pick purple_box_1
18. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room3 room4
19. gotoroom room3 room4 yellow_door_2 (now in room4, holding purple)
20. drop purple_box_1 room4 (both boxes in room4)
21. gotoobject grey_ball_2 room4

Now, constraint1: agent must hold blue_box_1 and have purple in room4. In this plan, blue is dropped in room4 at step13, and purple is dropped at step20. The agent holds blue in steps6-12 and purple in steps17-19. There is no state where the agent holds blue and purple is in room4. When purple is dropped in room4 (step20), blue is already there. So the agent is not holding blue. Therefore, constraint1 is not satisfied.

Thus, this approach doesn't work.

Therefore, the initial plan with 23 steps seems necessary. However, perhaps there's a way to combine steps. For example, after dropping purple in room4 (step16), instead of going back to room3, perhaps the agent can carry purple and blue together. But no, can't hold both.

Alternative idea: Use the fact that when the agent is in room4 after step15, they can drop purple and then immediately return to room3 to get blue, but that requires two trips. But maybe there's a shorter path.

Alternatively, after step10 (drop blue in room3), the agent can pick up purple and take it to room4, then return to room3, pick up blue, and take it to room4. But that's the same as before.

Another angle: The constraint1 requires that in at least one state, both conditions are true. So if the agent holds blue_box_1 in room3 after purple has been moved to room4, that's acceptable. But how?

After step16 (purple in room4), the agent is in room4. To hold blue again, they need to go back to room3, pick it up, and then return. So steps17-22.

But maybe after step10 (blue dropped in room3), the agent picks up purple and takes it to room4 (steps11-16), then returns to room3 (steps17-18), picks up blue (steps19-20), and goes back to room4 (steps21-22). Then, in step20, the agent is holding blue and purple is in room4. So that's the required state.

This is the same as the previous plan. So it seems unavoidable. Hence, the optimal plan must include these steps.

Now, the final plan would be:

```
gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_2
gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_1
toggle green_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_1 green_door_1
gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1
pick blue_box_1 room_1
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3
toggle yellow_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1
drop blue_box_1 room_3
gotoobject purple_box_1 room_3
pick purple_box_1 room_3
gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_3 room_4
toggle yellow_door_2
gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_2
drop purple_box_1 room_4
gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_3
gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_2
gotoobject blue_box_1 room_3
pick blue_box_1 room_3
gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_3 room_4
gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_2
gotoobject grey_ball_2 room_4
```

But let's count the steps. The above plan has 20 steps. Let me recount:

1. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_2
2. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_1
3. toggle green_door_1
4. gotoroom room_2 room_1 green_door_1
5. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1
6. pick blue_box_1 room_1
7. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3
8. toggle yellow_door_1
9. gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1
10. drop blue_box_1 room_3
11. gotoobject purple_box_1 room_3
12. pick purple_box_1 room_3
13. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_3 room_4
14. toggle yellow_door_2
15. gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_2
16. drop purple_box_1 room_4
17. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_3
18. gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_2
19. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_3
20. pick blue_box_1 room_3
21. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_3 room_4
22. gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_2
23. gotoobject grey_ball_2 room_4

Yes, 23 steps. But maybe steps17 and 18 can be optimized. After step16, the agent is in room4. To return to room3, they need to go through yellow_door_2. Since the door is already unlocked (step14), they can just go through. So:

16. drop purple_box_1 room_4
17. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_3
18. gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_2
19. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_3
20. pick blue_box_1 room_3
21. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_3 room_4
22. gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_2
23. gotoobject grey_ball_2 room_4

But in step21, do they need to toggle the door again? No, because it's already unlocked. So steps17-18 are necessary to return to room3, then steps21-22 to go back to room4.

But this adds steps. However, it's the only way to get blue_box_1 to room3 and then pick it up again.

But wait, in step10, blue_box_1 is in room3. So when the agent returns to room3 in step18, they can pick it up (step19-20), then go back to room4. So this part is necessary.

Thus, the plan as outlined is necessary. But perhaps there's a way to avoid some steps.

Wait, after step15 (agent in room4), they drop purple (step16), then immediately go back to room3 (steps17-18). In room3, they pick up blue (steps19-20), then return to room4 (steps21-22), and then go to grey_ball_2 (step23). 

But can the agent, after step20 (holding blue in room3), drop it somewhere else? No, because the goal requires being in front of grey_ball_2. So they need to go back to room4.

Alternatively, can the agent, after step20, go to room4 and drop blue there? But that adds steps. However, this would allow the agent to have blue in room4, but that's not necessary for the goal, just for constraint1.

But constraint1 is satisfied in step20, where the agent is holding blue and purple is in room4. So after step20, even if they drop blue in room3, it's okay. But no, because they need to be in room4 in front of grey_ball_2.

So after step20, the agent must go to room4 again. So steps21-23 are necessary.

Thus, the plan seems to be as short as possible, with 23 steps. But maybe I'm missing a more optimal path.

Another angle: The constraint1 says that in at least one state, both holding blue and purple in room4. So perhaps the agent can hold blue_box_1 in room4 after purple is there. For example:

After step15 (in room4 with purple), the agent goes back to room3, picks up blue, returns to room4, drops blue, and then goes to grey_ball_2. But this way, the state where the agent is holding blue in room4 (step20) has purple already there. So:

1. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_2
2. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_1
3. toggle green_door_1
4. gotoroom room_2 room_1 green_door_1
5. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1
6. pick blue_box_1 room_1
7. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3
8. toggle yellow_door_1
9. gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1
10. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_3 room_4
11. toggle yellow_door_2
12. gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_2 (now in room4 with blue)
13. drop blue_box_1 room_4 (blue in room4)
14. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_3
15. gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_2
16. gotoobject purple_box_1 room_3
17. pick purple_box_1 room_3
18. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_3 room_4
19. gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_2 (now in room4 with purple)
20. drop purple_box_1 room_4 (now both boxes in room4)
21. gotoobject grey_ball_2 room_4

But in this plan, when is the agent holding blue_box_1 and purple is in room4? In step6-12, the agent holds blue_box_1, but purple is in room3. In steps17-19, the agent holds purple, and blue is in room4. So no state where both conditions are true. Therefore, this approach doesn't work.

Thus, the only way is to have the agent hold blue_box_1 after purple is in room4. Hence, the plan must include the steps to go back and forth.

After careful consideration, the optimal plan seems to require the steps outlined earlier, totaling 23 actions. However, I might have made a mistake in counting or missed a shortcut. Let me check once more.

Wait, after step15 (agent in room4 with purple), the agent can drop it, then return to room3, pick blue, and go back to room4. But during this trip, the agent is holding blue_box_1, and purple is in room4. So step20 (pick blue in room3), step22 (enter room4 again). So in step22, the agent is in room4 holding blue, and purple is there. So in step22, they can drop blue, but the constraint1 is already satisfied in step20 (when they pick blue in room3, purple is in room4). So steps:

1. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_2
2. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_1
3. toggle green_door_1
4. gotoroom room_2 room_1 green_door_1
5. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1
6. pick blue_box_1 room_1
7. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3
8. toggle yellow_door_1
9. gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1
10. drop blue_box_1 room_3
11. gotoobject purple_box_1 room_3
12. pick purple_box_1 room_3
13. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_3 room_4
14. toggle yellow_door_2
15. gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_2
16. drop purple_box_1 room_4
17. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_3
18. gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_2
19. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_3
20. pick blue_box_1 room_3 (constraint1 satisfied here)
21. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_3 room_4
22. gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_2
23. gotoobject grey_ball_2 room_4

This is 23 steps, but step22 drops blue_box_1. If the agent doesn't need to drop it, they can proceed directly to grey_ball_2. So step23 is possible.

Yes, because after step22, the agent is in room4 holding blue_box_1. Then, they can drop it (optional) or proceed to grey_ball_2. But the goal requires being in front of grey_ball_2 and not holding anything? No, the goal doesn't say anything about holding. So the agent can be holding blue_box_1 while in front of grey_ball_2. However, the drop action requires being in front of an empty position. So to drop, they need to gotoempty first. But the goal doesn't require dropping. The goal is to be in room4, in front of a grey ball (grey_ball_2), which is already there. So as long as the agent is in front of it, the goal is achieved. So even if holding blue_box_1, the goal is satisfied. So steps:

After step22, the agent is in room4 holding blue_box_1. They need to gotoobject grey_ball_2 room4. But the precondition for gotoobject is that they are in the same room as the object. They are in room4, and grey_ball_2 is in room4. So they can do:

23. gotoobject grey_ball_2 room_4

This action will make them no longer in front of anything else, and in front of grey_ball_2. So this step is allowed even if holding an object. So the plan would end here, with the agent holding blue_box_1, but the goal is achieved. So this plan is valid with 23 steps.

But does the constraint1 require that in at least one state, both conditions are true? Yes, in step20, when the agent picks up blue_box_1 in room3, purple is already in room4 (step16). So this state satisfies constraint1.

Thus, the final plan is as follows with 23 steps, but maybe I can check again if any steps can be omitted.

For instance, when moving from room4 back to room3 (steps17-18), the agent can toggle the door again, but it's already unlocked. So steps17 and 18 are just gotodoor and gotoroom. But perhaps step17 can be omitted. No, because to go from room4 to room3, you need to use the door, which requires being in front of it.

So the steps are necessary.

Thus, the optimal plan is as outlined.
