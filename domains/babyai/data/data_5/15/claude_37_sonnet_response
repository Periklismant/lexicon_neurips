Let me analyze this problem step by step:

First, I'll understand the initial state:
- I am in room_2
- There are various objects in different rooms:
  - room_1: blue_box_1, red_ball_1
  - room_2: blue_ball_1, yellow_box_1
  - room_3: grey_box_1, purple_box_1, grey_ball_1
  - room_4: grey_ball_2
- All doors are locked: green_door_1, yellow_door_1, grey_door_1, yellow_door_2
- Room connections:
  - room_1 and room_2 via green_door_1
  - room_1 and room_3 via yellow_door_1
  - room_2 and room_4 via grey_door_1
  - room_3 and room_4 via yellow_door_2
- I'm not holding any object

The goal is:
- There is a grey ball in room_4 (which is grey_ball_2)
- I am in room_4
- I am in front of the grey ball

Let's check the constraints:
1. At some point, I must be holding blue_box_1 while purple_box_1 is in room_4
2. At some point, either red_ball_1 is in room_3 OR I am in front of blue_ball_1
3. At some point, I must be in room_2 (I start there, so this is satisfied initially)
4. If I am in room_2, I must be holding some object at that time or later
5. grey_door_1 must always remain locked
6. At some point, I must be in room_4 (which is part of the goal)
7. If I am in room_4, then earlier either blue_box_1 must have been in room_3 OR I must have been in front of yellow_door_1

Now, let's think about the plan:

Constraint 5 tells me I cannot use grey_door_1 to go from room_2 to room_4 directly. So to reach room_4, I need to:
- Go from room_2 to room_1 via green_door_1
- Go from room_1 to room_3 via yellow_door_1
- Go from room_3 to room_4 via yellow_door_2

Constraint 4 tells me I need to pick up something while in room_2. I have blue_ball_1 and yellow_box_1 there.
Constraint 1 tells me I need to hold blue_box_1 at some point when purple_box_1 is in room_4.

Constraint 2 can be satisfied by going in front of blue_ball_1 while in room_2.

For constraint 7, before being in room_4, I need to either:
- Move blue_box_1 to room_3
- Go in front of yellow_door_1

I have a lot of doors to unlock and specific movements to plan.

Let's sketch the high-level plan:
1. In room_2: Go in front of blue_ball_1 (satisfies constraint 2)
2. In room_2: Pick up an object (satisfies constraint 4)
3. Unlock and go through green_door_1 to reach room_1
4. In room_1: Pick up blue_box_1
5. Unlock and go through yellow_door_1 to reach room_3
6. In room_3: Drop blue_box_1 (satisfies part of constraint 7)
7. In room_3: Pick up purple_box_1
8. Unlock and go through yellow_door_2 to reach room_4
9. In room_4: Drop purple_box_1 (now I'm holding nothing)
10. In room_4: While holding blue_box_1, ensure purple_box_1 is in room_4 (satisfies constraint 1)
11. In room_4: Go in front of grey_ball_2 (achieves goal)

However, there's an issue with step 10. I need to ensure I'm holding blue_box_1 while purple_box_1 is in room_4. This means I need to:
1. Move blue_box_1 to room_4
2. Move purple_box_1 to room_4
3. Pick up blue_box_1 in room_4 (while purple_box_1 is also there)

Let me revise the plan:

1. In room_2: Go in front of blue_ball_1 (satisfies constraint 2)
2. In room_2: Pick up blue_ball_1 (satisfies constraint 4)
3. Unlock green_door_1
4. Go to room_1 via green_door_1
5. Drop blue_ball_1
6. Go in front of blue_box_1
7. Pick up blue_box_1
8. Unlock yellow_door_1
9. Go to room_3 via yellow_door_1 (now I've placed blue_box_1 in room_3, satisfying part of constraint 7)
10. Go in front of purple_box_1
11. Pick up purple_box_1
12. Unlock yellow_door_2
13. Go to room_4 via yellow_door_2
14. Drop purple_box_1 in room_4
15. Go back to room_3 via yellow_door_2
16. Go in front of blue_box_1
17. Pick up blue_box_1
18. Go to room_4 via yellow_door_2
19. Now I'm in room_4, holding blue_box_1, and purple_box_1 is in room_4 (satisfies constraint 1)
20. Drop blue_box_1
21. Go in front of grey_ball_2 (achieves goal)

Actually, let's be even more detailed and think through this step by step, making sure each action's preconditions are satisfied:

Starting in room_2:
- I need to go in front of blue_ball_1 (satisfies constraint 2)
  - Action: gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_2
- I need to pick up blue_ball_1 (satisfies constraint 4)
  - Action: pick blue_ball_1 room_2
- I need to go to the green door
  - Action: gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_1
- I need to unlock the green door
  - Action: toggle green_door_1
- I need to go to room_1
  - Action: gotoroom room_2 room_1 green_door_1
- I need to go in front of an empty space to drop blue_ball_1
  - Action: gotoempty
- I need to drop blue_ball_1
  - Action: drop blue_ball_1 room_1
- I need to go in front of blue_box_1
  - Action: gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1
- I need to pick up blue_box_1
  - Action: pick blue_box_1 room_1
- I need to go to the yellow door
  - Action: gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3
- I need to unlock the yellow door
  - Action: toggle yellow_door_1
- I need to go to room_3
  - Action: gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1
- I need to go in front of an empty space to drop blue_box_1
  - Action: gotoempty
- I need to drop blue_box_1 in room_3
  - Action: drop blue_box_1 room_3
- I need to go in front of purple_box_1
  - Action: gotoobject purple_box_1 room_3
- I need to pick up purple_box_1
  - Action: pick purple_box_1 room_3
- I need to go to the yellow door connecting room_3 and room_4
  - Action: gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_3 room_4
- I need to unlock the yellow door
  - Action: toggle yellow_door_2
- I need to go to room_4
  - Action: gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_2
- I need to go in front of an empty space to drop purple_box_1
  - Action: gotoempty
- I need to drop purple_box_1 in room_4
  - Action: drop purple_box_1 room_4
- I need to go back to room_3
  - Action: gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_3
  - Action: gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_2
- I need to go in front of blue_box_1
  - Action: gotoobject blue_box_1 room_3
- I need to pick up blue_box_1
  - Action: pick blue_box_1 room_3
- I need to go back to room_4
  - Action: gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_3 room_4
  - Action: gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_2
- Now I'm in room_4, holding blue_box_1, and purple_box_1 is in room_4 (satisfies constraint 1)
- I need to go in front of an empty space to drop blue_box_1
  - Action: gotoempty
- I need to drop blue_box_1
  - Action: drop blue_box_1 room_4
- I need to go in front of grey_ball_2
  - Action: gotoobject grey_ball_2 room_4

This achieves the goal: I'm in room_4 and in front of grey_ball_2, which is a grey ball in room_4.

Actually, I realized there might be an issue with the plan above. Let's check whether all constraints are satisfied:

1. At some point, I must be holding blue_box_1 while purple_box_1 is in room_4
   - Yes, this happens after I go back to room_4 with blue_box_1 while purple_box_1 is already there
2. At some point, either red_ball_1 is in room_3 OR I am in front of blue_ball_1
   - Yes, I go in front of blue_ball_1 in room_2 at the beginning
3. At some point, I must be in room_2
   - Yes, I start in room_2
4. If I am in room_2, I must be holding some object at that time or later
   - Yes, I pick up blue_ball_1 in room_2
5. grey_door_1 must always remain locked
   - Yes, I never toggle grey_door_1
6. At some point, I must be in room_4
   - Yes, I end up in room_4
7. If I am in room_4, then earlier either blue_box_1 must have been in room_3 OR I must have been in front of yellow_door_1
   - Yes, blue_box_1 is in room_3 before I move it to room_4

I believe I've satisfied all the constraints with this plan. Let me trace through the actions more carefully to make sure everything works:

Start: in room_2, hands empty

1. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_2
   - Now in front of blue_ball_1 in room_2 (satisfies constraint 2)
2. pick blue_ball_1 room_2
   - Now holding blue_ball_1 (satisfies constraint 4)
3. gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_1
   - Now in front of green_door_1
4. toggle green_door_1
   - green_door_1 is now unlocked
5. gotoroom room_2 room_1 green_door_1
   - Now in room_1
6. gotoempty
   - Now in front of an empty space
7. drop blue_ball_1 room_1
   - blue_ball_1 is now in room_1, hands empty
8. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1
   - Now in front of blue_box_1
9. pick blue_box_1 room_1
   - Now holding blue_box_1
10. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3
    - Now in front of yellow_door_1
11. toggle yellow_door_1
    - yellow_door_1 is now unlocked
12. gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1
    - Now in room_3 with blue_box_1 (satisfies part of constraint 7)
13. gotoempty
    - Now in front of an empty space
14. drop blue_box_1 room_3
    - blue_box_1 is now in room_3, hands empty
15. gotoobject purple_box_1 room_3
    - Now in front of purple_box_1
16. pick purple_box_1 room_3
    - Now holding purple_box_1
17. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_3 room_4
    - Now in front of yellow_door_2
18. toggle yellow_door_2
    - yellow_door_2 is now unlocked
19. gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_2
    - Now in room_4 with purple_box_1
20. gotoempty
    - Now in front of an empty space
21. drop purple_box_1 room_4
    - purple_box_1 is now in room_4, hands empty
22. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_3
    - Now in front of yellow_door_2
23. gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_2
    - Now back in room_3
24. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_3
    - Now in front of blue_box_1
25. pick blue_box_1 room_3
    - Now holding blue_box_1
26. gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_3 room_4
    - Now in front of yellow_door_2
27. gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_2
    - Now in room_4 holding blue_box_1, and purple_box_1 is in room_4 (satisfies constraint 1)
28. gotoempty
    - Now in front of an empty space
29. drop blue_box_1 room_4
    - blue_box_1 is now in room_4, hands empty
30. gotoobject grey_ball_2 room_4
    - Now in front of grey_ball_2 in room_4 (achieves goal)

This looks like a valid plan that satisfies all the constraints and achieves the goal. Let me write out the final plan formally:

```
gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_2
pick blue_ball_1 room_2
gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_1
toggle green_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_1 green_door_1
gotoempty
drop blue_ball_1 room_1
gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1
pick blue_box_1 room_1
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3
toggle yellow_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1
gotoempty
drop blue_box_1 room_3
gotoobject purple_box_1 room_3
pick purple_box_1 room_3
gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_3 room_4
toggle yellow_door_2
gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_2
gotoempty
drop purple_box_1 room_4
gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_3
gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_2
gotoobject blue_box_1 room_3
pick blue_box_1 room_3
gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_3 room_4
gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_2
gotoempty
drop blue_box_1 room_4
gotoobject grey_ball_2 room_4
```

Actually, let me review one more time to make sure this is an optimal plan:

The structure of the world - with four rooms connected in a square - means we need to traverse at least 3 rooms to get from room_2 to room_4 (since we can't use grey_door_1 due to constraint 5).

The need to satisfy constraints means we need to:
1. Go in front of blue_ball_1
2. Pick up an object in room_2
3. Move blue_box_1 to room_3 before going to room_4
4. Move purple_box_1 to room_4
5. Bring blue_box_1 to room_4 while purple_box_1 is there

Given these requirements, I don't see a more efficient way to achieve the goal. All steps in the plan are necessary to satisfy the constraints and achieve the goal.

There is one aspect I want to reconsider: do I need to move blue_box_1 to room_3 before moving purple_box_1 to room_4? Let's check:

- Constraint 7 says that if I am in room_4, then either blue_box_1 must have been in room_3 OR I must have been in front of yellow_door_1.
- I do go in front of yellow_door_1 (when unlocking it), so technically this constraint is already satisfied.

But I still need to get blue_box_1 to room_4 eventually to satisfy constraint 1, so I think the plan is optimal. Let me stick with the plan as outlined above.

Actually, I realize I can optimize the plan a bit. I can skip moving blue_box_1 to room_3 and then back to room_4. Since I go in front of yellow_door_1, constraint 7 is already satisfied. I can just carry blue_box_1 directly to room_4:

```
gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_2
pick blue_ball_1 room_2
gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_1
toggle green_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_1 green_door_1
gotoempty
drop blue_ball_1 room_1
gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1
pick blue_box_1 room_1
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3
toggle yellow_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1
gotoobject purple_box_1 room_3
gotoempty
drop blue_box_1 room_3
gotoobject purple_box_1 room_3
pick purple_box_1 room_3
gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_3 room_4
toggle yellow_door_2
gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_2
gotoempty
drop purple_box_1 room_4
gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_3
gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_2
gotoobject blue_box_1 room_3
pick blue_box_1 room_3
gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_3 room_4
gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_2
gotoempty
drop blue_box_1 room_4
gotoobject grey_ball_2 room_4
```

I'm having a bit of an issue in my plan - I need to drop blue_box_1 in room_3 before picking up purple_box_1, but in my sequence, I've got "gotoobject purple_box_1 room_3" followed immediately by "gotoempty". This doesn't make sense - I should be going to an empty position to drop blue_box_1, not right after going to purple_box_1.

Let me reorganize that part:

```
gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_2
pick blue_ball_1 room_2
gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_1
toggle green_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_1 green_door_1
gotoempty
drop blue_ball_1 room_1
gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1
pick blue_box_1 room_1
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3
toggle yellow_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1
gotoempty
drop blue_box_1 room_3
gotoobject purple_box_1 room_3
pick purple_box_1 room_3
gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_3 room_4
toggle yellow_door_2
gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_2
gotoempty
drop purple_box_1 room_4
gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_3
gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_2
gotoobject blue_box_1 room_3
pick blue_box_1 room_3
gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_3 room_4
gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_2
gotoempty
drop blue_box_1 room_4
gotoobject grey_ball_2 room_4
```

This plan looks correct now. Let me double-check:

- I satisfy constraint 1 by holding blue_box_1 while purple_box_1 is in room_4
- I satisfy constraint 2 by going in front of blue_ball_1
- I satisfy constraint 3 by being in room_2 (already satisfied initially)
- I satisfy constraint 4 by picking up blue_ball_1 while in room_2
- I satisfy constraint 5 by never toggling grey_door_1
- I satisfy constraint 6 by being in room_4 at the end
- I satisfy constraint 7 by being in front of yellow_door_1 and also having blue_box_1 in room_3 before going to room_4

This plan does not skip any necessary steps and efficiently meets all constraints and achieves the goal.

Let me verify this is optimal:
- We must get blue_box_1 from room_1, which requires going there
- We must get purple_box_1 from room_3, which requires going there
- We must end up in room_4 with blue_box_1 and purple_box_1
- We must go in front of blue_ball_1 at some point
- We can't use grey_door_1, so we must take the path through room_1 and room_3 to get to room_4

Given these requirements, we can't solve this problem in fewer steps.

The final plan is:

```
gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_2
pick blue_ball_1 room_2
gotodoor green_door_1 room_2 room_1
toggle green_door_1
gotoroom room_2 room_1 green_door_1
gotoempty
drop blue_ball_1 room_1
gotoobject blue_box_1 room_1
pick blue_box_1 room_1
gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_3
toggle yellow_door_1
gotoroom room_1 room_3 yellow_door_1
gotoempty
drop blue_box_1 room_3
gotoobject purple_box_1 room_3
pick purple_box_1 room_3
gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_3 room_4
toggle yellow_door_2
gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_2
gotoempty
drop purple_box_1 room_4
gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_4 room_3
gotoroom room_4 room_3 yellow_door_2
gotoobject blue_box_1 room_3
pick blue_box_1 room_3
gotodoor yellow_door_2 room_3 room_4
gotoroom room_3 room_4 yellow_door_2
gotoempty
drop blue_box_1 room_4
gotoobject grey_ball_2 room_4
```
