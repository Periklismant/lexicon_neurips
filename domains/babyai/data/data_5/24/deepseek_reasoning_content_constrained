Okay, let's try to tackle this planning problem. So, the goal is to have a blue door that's unlocked, I'm in front of it, and it's not locked. The constraints are a bit tricky, so I need to make sure all of them are satisfied.

First, the initial state: I'm in room_4. The blue_door_1 connects room_3 and room_4. All doors are locked initially, including blue_door_1. So I need to unlock blue_door_1, but there's a constraint that blue_door_1 must be locked in at least one state. Since it starts locked, that's covered as long as I don't unlock it before some other action. But then I have to unlock it later. Also, if I unlock blue_door_1, I need to have been in room_1 at some earlier state. So I have to go to room_1 before unlocking blue_door_1. That complicates things.

Another constraint is that when blue_door_1 is locked, I must be holding something either then or after. Also, I need to have at least one state where I'm holding an object. Also, there's a state needed where either I'm in front of purple_door_1 or holding purple_ball_1. Plus, blue_ball_1 must be in room_1 at some point.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Get to room_1. But how? Starting in room_4. The doors from room_4 are purple_door_2 (to room_2) and blue_door_1 (to room_3). Both are locked. So I need to unlock doors. But to unlock a door, I need to be in front of it. But doors are locked, so I can't go through them yet. Wait, but the goto door action's precondition is that I'm in a room connected by the door and the position in front isn't blocked. But initially, all doors are locked. So can I go in front of a door even if it's locked? The "gotodoor" action's preconditions: (i) in a room connected by the door, (ii) no object blocking the position in front. So, yes. Because the door being locked doesn't block the position. So I can go in front of blue_door_1 in room_4, then toggle it to unlock. Then go through to room_3.

But wait, the problem is that the constraint says that if blue_door_1 is unlocked at any state, there must have been an earlier state where I was in room_1. So I can't unlock blue_door_1 until I've been to room_1. But how do I get to room_1 from room_4? Let's see the room connections. From room_4, doors to room_2 (purple_door_2) and room_3 (blue_door_1). Both are locked. So to get to room_1, perhaps via room_3 and then room_1. But room_3 is connected to room_1 via green_door_1, which is locked. So maybe:

Room_4 → blue_door_1 (unlock) → room_3 → green_door_1 (unlock?) But green_door_1 is locked. So I need to unlock green_door_1. To unlock green_door_1, I need to be in front of it. But green_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3. So if I'm in room_3, I can go in front of green_door_1, toggle it to unlock, then go to room_1. But to get to room_3 from room_4, I need to unlock blue_door_1 first. But unlocking blue_door_1 would require that I was in room_1 before. Which I can't get to yet. So this seems like a loop.

Alternative path: From room_4, go to room_2 via purple_door_2. But purple_door_2 is locked. So I need to unlock it. But to unlock purple_door_2, I need to be in front of it in room_4. Then toggle it. Then go to room_2. From room_2, purple_door_1 connects to room_1. But purple_door_1 is locked. So need to unlock it. To unlock purple_door_1, I need to be in front of it in room_2. Then toggle. Then go to room_1. Once in room_1, maybe that satisfies the constraint for blue_door_1.

Let me try this path:

Start in room_4.

1. gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_2 (since I'm in room_4, which is connected to room_2 via purple_door_2. Need to check if the position in front is blocked. The initial state doesn't mention any objects blocking doors, so assume it's not blocked. So goto door purple_door_2 in room_4.

Action: gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_2

Then toggle purple_door_2 (since it's locked, this will unlock it). Then gotoroom room_4 room_2 purple_door_2. Now in room_2.

From room_2, need to get to room_1 via purple_door_1. But purple_door_1 is locked. So:

gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1 (precondition: in room_2 which is connected via purple_door_1). Then toggle it to unlock. Then go to room_1.

So actions:

2. toggle purple_door_2

3. gotoroom room_4 room_2 purple_door_2

Now in room_2.

4. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1

5. toggle purple_door_1

6. gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1

Now in room_1. This satisfies the constraint that before blue_door_1 is unlocked, I was in room_1.

Now, to unlock blue_door_1, which is between room_3 and room_4. But I'm in room_1. How to get to blue_door_1? From room_1, can go to room_3 via green_door_1. But green_door_1 is locked. So need to unlock green_door_1.

In room_1:

7. gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3

8. toggle green_door_1 (unlocking it)

9. gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1

Now in room_3. Then from room_3, go to room_4 via blue_door_1. But blue_door_1 is locked. So:

10. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_4

11. toggle blue_door_1 (unlock it)

But wait, the constraint says that blue_door_1 must be locked in at least one state. Since it starts locked, and we unlock it here, that's okay. Also, when unlocking blue_door_1, we need to have been in room_1 earlier, which we have.

But another constraint: if blue_door_1 is locked in some state, then in that state or after, I must be holding some object. So when blue_door_1 is locked (initially, and after any toggle that locks it again?), but since the initial state has it locked, and I need to have a state where I'm holding an object. So perhaps I need to pick up an object at some point.

Also, another constraint: blue_ball_1 must be in room_1 at some state. So I need to move blue_ball_1 from room_2 (its initial location) to room_1. So perhaps pick it up in room_2 and drop it in room_1.

But how? Let's see. From room_1, to room_2 via purple_door_1 (already unlocked). So:

After step 6, I'm in room_1. Then, need to go back to room_2 to get blue_ball_1. But that requires going through purple_door_1 again, which is now unlocked.

Wait, but after step 6, I'm in room_1. Then, steps 7-9 take me to room_3. But maybe I should first handle moving blue_ball_1 to room_1.

Alternatively, after unlocking purple_door_1 and entering room_1, maybe go back to room_2 to pick up blue_ball_1.

Let me adjust the plan:

After step 6 (in room_1), perhaps:

7. gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1 (since door is unlocked)

But wait, gotoroom requires being in front of the door? Or no. The gotoroom action is "gotoroom r1 r2 d" which implies moving from r1 to r2 through door d. The preconditions are that you are in r1 adjacent to r2 via door d, and the door is unlocked.

So, to go from room_1 to room_2 via purple_door_1, which is now unlocked.

But to perform gotoroom, you need to be in room_1. The action is "gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1".

But where are you positioned? After step 6, you are in room_1, but not in front of any door. So to use the gotoroom action, you need to be in room_1, adjacent to room_2 via purple_door_1, which is unlocked. But the preconditions for gotoroom don't require being in front of the door. Wait, checking the preconditions for "goto room":

"goto room": you may only go to a room r if (i) you are currently in a room r0 that is adjacent to r, and (ii) the door connecting r0 and r is unlocked.

So, you don't need to be in front of the door. Wait, but the action is "gotoroom r1 r2 d": Go to room r2 from room r1 using door d. So perhaps you can do this action regardless of your position in the room, as long as you're in r1 and the door is unlocked.

If that's the case, then after step 6 (in room_1), you can go back to room_2 via purple_door_1.

But then, in room_2, pick up blue_ball_1.

But then, need to drop it in room_1. So:

7. gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1

8. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_2

9. pick blue_ball_1 room_2

10. gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1

11. drop blue_ball_1 room_1

This would satisfy the constraint that blue_ball_1 is in room_1 at some state.

But this requires that after dropping, blue_ball_1 is in room_1. Then, proceed to unlock green_door_1, etc.

But let's see if this can fit into the plan.

But the problem is that the initial plan to reach room_1 and then proceed to unlock blue_door_1 requires going through room_3 and room_4 again.

Alternatively, maybe I need to collect some objects to satisfy the constraints. For example, the constraint that in some state, I'm holding an object. Also, when blue_door_1 is locked (initially), I need to be holding an object either then or after. Since initially, I'm not holding anything, but blue_door_1 is locked. So I need to hold an object at some point after the initial state. Which would be satisfied by picking up any object.

Another constraint: there's a state where I'm either in front of purple_door_1 or holding purple_ball_1. Purple_ball_1 is in room_4 initially. So if I go back to room_4 at some point, I can pick it up. Alternatively, being in front of purple_door_1 (which is between room_1 and room_2). So when I was in room_2, I could go in front of purple_door_1 again.

But perhaps the simplest way is to include picking up purple_ball_1 later.

Putting this all together, let's outline the steps:

1. From room_4, go to purple_door_2 (room_4 to room_2 door).

Action: gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_2

2. Toggle purple_door_2 to unlock it.

3. Gotoroom to room_2.

4. Go to purple_door_1 in room_2.

5. Toggle to unlock.

6. Gotoroom to room_1. Now, we've been in room_1, satisfying the constraint for blue_door_1.

7. Go back to room_2 to pick up blue_ball_1.

8. Gotoobject blue_ball_1 in room_2.

9. Pick it up.

10. Return to room_1 and drop it. Now blue_ball_1 is in room_1.

11. Now, need to unlock green_door_1 to get to room_3.

From room_1, go to green_door_1.

12. gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3

13. Toggle to unlock.

14. Gotoroom to room_3.

15. Now, in room_3, need to unlock blue_door_1. But blue_door_1 connects room_3 and room_4. So:

gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_4

16. Toggle blue_door_1 to unlock it.

17. Now, go to room_4 via blue_door_1.

But the goal is to be in front of a blue door that's unlocked. Blue_door_1 is blue. After step 16, blue_door_1 is unlocked. But I'm in room_3. To be in front of it, I need to go to room_3's side of blue_door_1, then perform gotodoor.

Wait, after step 16, I'm in front of blue_door_1 (since step 15 is gotodoor, step 16 is toggle). Then after unlocking, I can stay in front of blue_door_1. So the final state would require being in front of blue_door_1, which is unlocked. So steps 15 and 16 would get me there.

But wait, after step 15: gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_4. Now, I'm in front of blue_door_1. Then step 16: toggle to unlock. Now, blue_door_1 is unlocked, and I'm in front of it. That satisfies the goal: there's a door d (blue_door_1) that's blue, I'm in front of it, and it's not locked.

So steps up to 16 would achieve the goal. But need to check all constraints.

Constraints:

- blue_door_1 is locked in at least one state: yes, initially and until step 16.

- If blue_door_1 is locked in some state, then I must be holding an object at that state or after. When blue_door_1 is locked (initially), I'm not holding anything. But after step 9 (pick blue_ball_1), I'm holding an object. So that satisfies the constraint because after the initial state, I eventually hold an object. Because the constraint says "must hold at s or at some state after s". So even though in the initial state s where blue_door_1 is locked, I'm not holding anything, but later in step 9 I hold an object, which is after s, so it's okay.

- blue_door_1 is not locked in at least one state: step 16 onwards.

- If blue_door_1 is not locked, then there's an earlier state where I was in room_1: step 6.

- At least one state where I'm in front of purple_door_1 or holding purple_ball_1: step 4 (gotodoor purple_door_1) and step 5 (toggle), so I was in front of purple_door_1.

- blue_ball_1 in room_1: step 10 (drop in room_1).

- At least one state where holding an object: steps 9-10, and maybe others.

So this plan seems to satisfy all constraints.

Now, the steps would be:

1. gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_2

2. toggle purple_door_2

3. gotoroom room_4 room_2 purple_door_2

4. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1

5. toggle purple_door_1

6. gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1

7. gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1

8. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_2

9. pick blue_ball_1 room_2

10. gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1

11. drop blue_ball_1 room_1

12. gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3

13. toggle green_door_1

14. gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1

15. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_4

16. toggle blue_door_1

But wait, after step 16, I'm still in room_3. The goal is to be in front of blue_door_1, which is in room_3. So after step 15 (goto door blue_door_1 in room_3), then toggle it. So after step 16, I'm in front of blue_door_1, which is now unlocked. That meets the goal.

So this plan should work.

But let me check the order of steps again.

Wait, step 7 is going back to room_2. But after step 6, we're in room_1. To pick up blue_ball_1, which is in room_2, we need to go back to room_2. So steps 7 is gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1. Then steps 8-11.

But after step 11, we're back in room_1, having dropped blue_ball_1 there. Then proceed to unlock green_door_1 and go to room_3.

This seems correct.

Now, check if all constraints are met:

- blue_door_1 is locked in initial state (yes), and after step 16 it's unlocked. So the first constraint is met.

- For the constraint when blue_door_1 is locked (any state), the agent must be holding something at or after. The initial state is blue_door_1 locked, and the agent isn't holding anything. But after step 9, the agent is holding blue_ball_1, which is after the initial state. So that satisfies the constraint.

- blue_door_1 is not locked in step 16 onwards: yes.

- The condition that when blue_door_1 is not locked, there was an earlier state in room_1: yes, step 6.

- At least one state with in front of purple_door_1 or holding purple_ball_1: step 4 (front of purple_door_1).

- blue_ball_1 in room_1: after step 11.

- holding some object: step 9-10.

All constraints are met.

So the final plan would be these steps. But need to check if it's the shortest possible.

Alternative: Maybe there's a shorter path. For example, after unlocking blue_door_1 in room_3, can I immediately be in front of it, thus satisfying the goal.

But the steps as above are necessary to meet all constraints. For example, moving blue_ball_1 to room_1 requires several steps. Also, visiting room_1 is needed before unlocking blue_door_1.

I think this is the optimal plan given the constraints. Let me count the steps. From 1 to 16: 16 actions. But maybe some steps can be optimized.

Wait, after step 6 (in room_1), instead of going back to room_2, can I proceed to room_3 via green_door_1, unlock it, then go to room_3, then to room_4 via blue_door_1. But then, the blue_ball_1 would still be in room_2, violating the constraint that it needs to be in room_1. So no, that's necessary.

Alternatively, after step 6, go to room_3 via green_door_1 (unlock), then go to room_4, but that skips moving blue_ball_1. So no.

Thus, the steps outlined are necessary. So the plan is valid and optimal.
