I need to find a valid plan that achieves the goal while satisfying all constraints. Let me analyze the problem:

Goal: "There is a door d such that "The following conditions are all true: "d is blue", "you are in front of d", "d is not locked"""

So I need to find a blue door, be in front of it, and the door should be unlocked. I know that blue_door_1 is blue, and it's the door connecting room_3 and room_4.

Constraints:
1. blue_door_1 needs to be locked at some point
2. If blue_door_1 is locked at some state, I need to be holding some object at that state or a later state
3. blue_door_1 needs to be unlocked at some point
4. If blue_door_1 is unlocked at some state, I must have been in room_1 at an earlier state
5. At some point, I need to either be in front of purple_door_1 or holding purple_ball_1
6. At some point, blue_ball_1 needs to be in room_1
7. At some point, I need to be holding some object

Initial state:
- I'm in room_4
- blue_door_1 is locked and connects room_3 and room_4
- blue_door_1 is blue
- blue_ball_1 is in room_2
- purple_ball_1 is in room_4
- blue_ball_2 is in room_2
- All doors are locked

Let me plan this step by step:

First, I need to satisfy constraint 4, which means I need to visit room_1 before unlocking blue_door_1. To get to room_1 from room_4, I need to go through either:
- room_4 -> room_2 -> room_1 via purple_door_2 and purple_door_1
- room_4 -> room_3 -> room_1 via blue_door_1 and green_door_1

But all doors are locked. I need to unlock at least one door to start moving between rooms.

Let's first check which door I can unlock:
1. I am in room_4, which connects to room_2 via purple_door_2 and to room_3 via blue_door_1
2. I need to approach either door and toggle it to unlock it

Let's first try to unlock blue_door_1:

1. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_4 room_3
2. toggle blue_door_1 (now blue_door_1 is unlocked)

But wait - this would violate constraint 4, which says I need to have been in room_1 before unlocking blue_door_1. So I can't unlock blue_door_1 yet.

Let's try purple_door_2 instead:

1. gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_2
2. toggle purple_door_2 (now purple_door_2 is unlocked)
3. gotoroom room_4 room_2 purple_door_2 (now I'm in room_2)

From room_2, I can go to room_1 via purple_door_1:

4. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1
5. toggle purple_door_1 (now purple_door_1 is unlocked)
6. gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1 (now I'm in room_1)

Now I've visited room_1, satisfying part of constraint 4. Let's satisfy constraint 6 by bringing blue_ball_1 to room_1:

7. gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1 (back to room_2)
8. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_2
9. pick blue_ball_1 room_2 (now I'm holding blue_ball_1)
10. gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1 (back to room_1)
11. gotoempty
12. drop blue_ball_1 room_1 (blue_ball_1 is now in room_1)

Now I need to satisfy constraint 5 (either be in front of purple_door_1 or hold purple_ball_1).
I was already in front of purple_door_1 in step 4, so this constraint is already satisfied.

Next, I need to go back to room_4, unlock blue_door_1, and end up in front of it while it's unlocked:

13. gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1 (but green_door_1 is locked)

I need to unlock green_door_1 first:

13. gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3
14. toggle green_door_1 (now green_door_1 is unlocked)
15. gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1 (now I'm in room_3)
16. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_4
17. toggle blue_door_1 (now blue_door_1 is unlocked)

But wait, I've now unlocked blue_door_1 after visiting room_1, which satisfies constraint 4. However, I also need to satisfy constraints 1, 2, and 7. According to constraint 1, blue_door_1 needs to be locked at some point, which it was initially, so that's fine. 

According to constraint 2, if blue_door_1 is locked, I need to be holding an object at that state or later. And according to constraint 7, I need to be holding an object at some point. I've already held blue_ball_1 to move it to room_1, so constraints 2 and 7 are satisfied.

Now I need to end up in front of blue_door_1 while it's unlocked to satisfy the goal:

18. gotoroom room_3 room_4 blue_door_1 (now I'm in room_4)
19. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_4 room_3 (now I'm in front of blue_door_1)

But wait, this doesn't work. When I do gotoroom, I'm no longer in front of any object or door. So I need to modify the plan.

Let me review the goal again: I need to be in front of blue_door_1 while it's unlocked.

Let's adjust the plan:

1. gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_2
2. toggle purple_door_2 (now purple_door_2 is unlocked)
3. gotoroom room_4 room_2 purple_door_2 (now I'm in room_2)
4. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1
5. toggle purple_door_1 (now purple_door_1 is unlocked)
6. gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1 (now I'm in room_1)

At this point, I've visited room_1, which is needed for constraint 4.

7. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_2 (but I'm in room_1, so I can't do this)

I need to go back to room_2 first:

7. gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1 (now I'm in room_2)
8. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_2
9. pick blue_ball_1 room_2 (now I'm holding blue_ball_1, satisfying constraints 2 and 7)
10. gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1 (back to room_1)
11. gotoempty
12. drop blue_ball_1 room_1 (blue_ball_1 is now in room_1, satisfying constraint 6)

Now I need to go to room_3 to reach blue_door_1:

13. gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3
14. toggle green_door_1 (now green_door_1 is unlocked)
15. gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1 (now I'm in room_3)

Now I can get to blue_door_1:

16. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_4
17. toggle blue_door_1 (now blue_door_1 is unlocked, satisfying constraint 3)

Now I'm in front of blue_door_1, it's blue, and it's unlocked. This satisfies the goal!

But I need to double-check all constraints:

1. "blue_door_1 is locked" at some point - Yes, it was locked initially
2. If blue_door_1 is locked, I need to hold an object at that state or later - Yes, I held blue_ball_1
3. "blue_door_1 is not locked" at some point - Yes, after step 17
4. If blue_door_1 is unlocked, I must have been in room_1 earlier - Yes, in steps 6-12
5. Be in front of purple_door_1 or hold purple_ball_1 at some point - Yes, I was in front of purple_door_1 in step 4
6. blue_ball_1 in room_1 at some point - Yes, after step 12
7. Hold some object at some point - Yes, blue_ball_1 in step 9

The plan meets all constraints and achieves the goal. Let me finalize it:

1. gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_2
2. toggle purple_door_2
3. gotoroom room_4 room_2 purple_door_2
4. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1
5. toggle purple_door_1
6. gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1
7. gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1
8. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_2
9. pick blue_ball_1 room_2
10. gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1
11. gotoempty
12. drop blue_ball_1 room_1
13. gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3
14. toggle green_door_1
15. gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1
16. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_4
17. toggle blue_door_1

Actually, there's an issue with the plan. In step 5, I'm toggling purple_door_1, but I haven't verified whether the "in front of purple_door_1" constraint (constraint 5) has been met. I need to be explicitly in front of the door before toggling it. Let me revise:

1. gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_2 (now I'm in front of purple_door_2)
2. toggle purple_door_2 (purple_door_2 is now unlocked)
3. gotoroom room_4 room_2 purple_door_2 (now I'm in room_2)
4. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1 (now I'm in front of purple_door_1, satisfying constraint 5)
5. toggle purple_door_1 (purple_door_1 is now unlocked)
6. gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1 (now I'm in room_1)
7. gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1 (back to room_2)
8. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_2 (in front of blue_ball_1)
9. pick blue_ball_1 room_2 (now holding blue_ball_1, satisfying constraints 2 and 7)
10. gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1 (back to room_1)
11. gotoempty (in front of empty position)
12. drop blue_ball_1 room_1 (blue_ball_1 is now in room_1, satisfying constraint 6)
13. gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3 (in front of green_door_1)
14. toggle green_door_1 (green_door_1 is now unlocked)
15. gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1 (now in room_3)
16. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_4 (in front of blue_door_1)
17. toggle blue_door_1 (blue_door_1 is now unlocked, satisfying constraint 3 and the goal)

The plan satisfies all constraints and achieves the goal of being in front of blue_door_1 while it's unlocked.

Actually, let me think about the optimality of this plan. Can I make it shorter?

What if I try a different route?

Starting from room_4:
1. I could go to room_2 via purple_door_2
2. Then to room_1 via purple_door_1
3. Then to room_3 via green_door_1
4. Then back to room_4 via blue_door_1

Or, starting from room_4:
1. I could go to room_3 via blue_door_1
2. Then to room_1 via green_door_1
3. Then to room_2 via purple_door_1
4. Then back to room_4 via purple_door_2

The first route requires me to toggle 4 doors: purple_door_2, purple_door_1, green_door_1, and blue_door_1.
The second route also requires toggling 4 doors but in a different order: blue_door_1, green_door_1, purple_door_1, and purple_door_2.

However, there's an issue with the second route. Constraint 4 states that if blue_door_1 is unlocked, I must have been in room_1 at an earlier state. So I can't unlock blue_door_1 first.

But I'm overthinking this. The goal is just to be in front of blue_door_1 while it's unlocked. If I follow the first route, I'll have visited room_1 before unlocking blue_door_1, and I'll end up in front of blue_door_1 when it's unlocked.

Let me also check if satisfying the constraints is optimal:
- Constraint 5: Be in front of purple_door_1 or hold purple_ball_1. It's more efficient to be in front of purple_door_1 since I need to go through it anyway.
- Constraint 6: blue_ball_1 in room_1. This requires picking up blue_ball_1 from room_2 and dropping it in room_1.
- Constraint 7: Hold some object. Holding blue_ball_1 for constraint 6 satisfies this.

One more thing: can I optimize by not visiting all rooms? Do I really need to go to room_3?

Actually, I need to go to room_3 to reach blue_door_1 from the room_3 side. The goal requires me to be in front of blue_door_1 while it's unlocked, and blue_door_1 connects room_3 and room_4.

OK, I think the plan is optimal. Let me finalize it again:

1. gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_2
2. toggle purple_door_2
3. gotoroom room_4 room_2 purple_door_2
4. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1
5. toggle purple_door_1
6. gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1
7. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_2 (but I'm in room_1, so this is invalid)

Let me correct this:

7. gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1
8. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_2
9. pick blue_ball_1 room_2
10. gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1
11. gotoempty
12. drop blue_ball_1 room_1
13. gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3
14. toggle green_door_1
15. gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1
16. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_4
17. toggle blue_door_1

This plan should work. Let me review it one more time:

1. gotodoor purple_door_2 room_4 room_2 (Move to the position in front of purple_door_2)
2. toggle purple_door_2 (Unlock purple_door_2)
3. gotoroom room_4 room_2 purple_door_2 (Go from room_4 to room_2)
4. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1 (Move to the position in front of purple_door_1, satisfying constraint 5)
5. toggle purple_door_1 (Unlock purple_door_1)
6. gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1 (Go from room_2 to room_1, satisfying part of constraint 4)
7. gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1 (Go back to room_2)
8. gotoobject blue_ball_1 room_2 (Move to the position in front of blue_ball_1)
9. pick blue_ball_1 room_2 (Pick up blue_ball_1, satisfying constraints 2 and 7)
10. gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1 (Go back to room_1)
11. gotoempty (Move to an empty position)
12. drop blue_ball_1 room_1 (Drop blue_ball_1 in room_1, satisfying constraint 6)
13. gotodoor green_door_1 room_1 room_3 (Move to the position in front of green_door_1)
14. toggle green_door_1 (Unlock green_door_1)
15. gotoroom room_1 room_3 green_door_1 (Go from room_1 to room_3)
16. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_4 (Move to the position in front of blue_door_1)
17. toggle blue_door_1 (Unlock blue_door_1, satisfying the goal and constraint 3)

The plan is optimal and satisfies all constraints.
