Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. Hmm, the goal is to end up in front of a red door that's unlocked. The red door here is red_door_1, right? Because in the initial state, red_door_1 is locked and connects room_2 and room_4. So I need to get to room_2 or room_4 and be in front of red_door_1, then unlock it. But wait, the final goal just needs a red door that's unlocked, so maybe I can unlock it first and then go there. But also, the constraints complicate things.

Looking at the constraints:

1. At least one state where red_door_1 is locked. Well, initially it's locked, so that's covered unless we unlock it and never lock it again. But since the final goal requires it to be unlocked, maybe we have to lock and then unlock it again? Wait, no. The initial state already has red_door_1 locked, so that first condition is already satisfied. So maybe that constraint is already met, but the plan needs to ensure that during execution, there's a state where it's locked. Since the initial state is part of the plan's states, maybe that's covered. Wait, but the user might require that during the actions, it's locked again. Let me check the constraints again.

The first constraint says "The following expression must hold in at least one state: red_door_1 is locked". The initial state has it locked, so unless the plan starts by unlocking it, that condition is already satisfied. But if the plan's first action is to unlock it, then maybe the initial state is the only state where it's locked. But according to the problem statement, the constraints must hold in the plan's states. Since the initial state is part of the state sequence, that condition is already met. So maybe we don't need to do anything extra for that constraint. Wait, but maybe the user wants it to be locked again after being unlocked. Let me check the constraints again.

Another constraint is that if red_door_1 is locked in some state s, then in s or a state after, grey_door_1 must not be locked. Since initially, grey_door_1 is locked, but in the initial state, red_door_1 is locked, so the constraint requires that in that initial state or after, grey_door_1 must be unlocked. But in the initial state, grey_door_1 is locked, so we need to unlock it at some point after. So maybe the plan needs to unlock grey_door_1 at some point after the initial state.

Another constraint: red_door_1 must be not locked in at least one state. Since the goal requires the door to be unlocked, we have to unlock it. So that's covered when we toggle it.

The next constraint: if red_door_1 is not locked in some state, then there's an earlier state where purple_ball_1 is in room_2. So before unlocking red_door_1, we need to have purple_ball_1 moved to room_2. But purple_ball_1 is initially in room_1. So we need to move it to room_2. That requires picking it up in room_1, carrying it through doors to room_2, and dropping it there. But how do we get to room_1? Let's see.

The agent starts in room_4. The doors are all locked. So first, we need to unlock doors to navigate. Let's look at the doors:

room_4 is connected to room_2 via red_door_1 and to room_3 via grey_door_1. Both are locked. So to get out of room_4, maybe we need to unlock one of these doors. But since all doors are locked, how can we proceed? Wait, the agent can only toggle a door if they are in front of it. To get in front of a door, they must be in a room connected by that door. So in room_4, the agent can go to red_door_1 (connecting room_4 and room_2) and grey_door_1 (connecting room_4 and room_3). But the preconditions for gotodoor are that you are in a room connected by d and there's no object blocking the position in front of d in the current room. The initial state doesn't mention any objects blocking doors. So maybe the agent can go to the doors in room_4.

Wait, the initial state in room_4 has green_box_1, blue_box_1, red_ball_2. Are any of these blocking the doors? The problem says "there is no object blocking the position in front of d in the room you are currently in". The initial state doesn't mention any objects blocking doors, so maybe it's safe to assume that the doors are not blocked. So the agent can go to the doors in room_4.

So first, the agent can go to red_door_1 in room_4. Wait, but "gotodoor d r1 r2" requires that you are in a room (r1 or r2) connected by d. So in room_4, the doors are red_door_1 (connecting room_4 and room_2) and grey_door_1 (connecting room_4 and room_3). So the agent can do gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2 (but the action is "gotodoor d r1 r2", where r1 and r2 are the rooms connected by d). Wait, the syntax for gotodoor is "gotodoor d r1 r2", but the agent's current room must be either r1 or r2. So in room_4, to go to red_door_1, which connects room_2 and room_4, the agent can perform gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_4. Wait, but how is the command structured? The action is "gotodoor d r1 r2", where d is the door, and r1 and r2 are the two rooms it connects. So in room_4, the agent can do gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2 (or room_2 room_4, order might not matter). Then, after being in front of the door, toggle it to unlock.

But initially, all doors are locked, so the agent can't move through them. So the first step would be to unlock a door to move to another room.

Wait, the agent is in room_4. Let's try to unlock grey_door_1 first. Because maybe that's easier to reach room_3, then room_1, etc. So steps:

1. Go to grey_door_1 in room_4 (gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3). Then toggle it to unlock. Now grey_door_1 is unlocked. Then, the agent can go through grey_door_1 to room_3. But then, from room_3, they can go to room_1 via blue_door_1, which is locked. So need to unlock that. But blue_door_1 is in room_3 and room_1, but initially locked. So the agent would need to get to blue_door_1 in room_3, unlock it, then go to room_1. But how?

Alternatively, maybe unlock red_door_1 first. But to unlock red_door_1, the agent has to be in front of it. So in room_4, gotodoor red_door_1 room_4 room_2. Then toggle to unlock it. But red_door_1 is initially locked. Toggling it would unlock it. Then, the agent can go to room_2 via red_door_1. Once in room_2, they can go to yellow_door_1 (connecting room_1 and room_2) to get to room_1. But yellow_door_1 is locked. So the agent would need to unlock it. But to unlock yellow_door_1, they need to be in front of it. So from room_2, gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_2 room_1. Then toggle to unlock. Then go to room_1.

But let's see the constraints. One of them is that if "you are in front of red_door_1" in some state, there must be an earlier state where you are in front of blue_door_1. So to satisfy this, the agent must first be in front of blue_door_1 before being in front of red_door_1. Wait, but the agent starts in room_4. Blue_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3. So the only way to get to blue_door_1 is to be in room_1 or room_3. But initially, the agent is in room_4. So to reach blue_door_1, the agent must first go through room_3 via grey_door_1 (unlocking it), then to room_3, then unlock blue_door_1 (which is in room_3), then go to room_1. So perhaps the sequence is:

1. Unlock grey_door_1 from room_4.
2. Go to room_3.
3. Unlock blue_door_1 in room_3.
4. Go to room_1 via blue_door_1.
5. In room_1, pick up purple_ball_1.
6. Bring it back to room_2 via yellow_door_1 (unlocking it), etc.

But let's outline the steps considering the constraints:

Constraints:

- Must be in front of red_door_1 at some point. So the plan must include that.

- When in front of red_door_1, there must have been an earlier state where the agent was in front of blue_door_1.

So the agent must first be in front of blue_door_1, then later in front of red_door_1.

So to get to blue_door_1, the agent needs to be in room_1 or room_3. Let's see:

Starting in room_4:

Option 1: Unlock grey_door_1 (room_4 to room_3) first.

1. In room_4, go to grey_door_1 (gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3).

2. Toggle grey_door_1 to unlock it.

3. Use gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1 to move to room_3.

4. Now in room_3. To get to blue_door_1 (connects room_1 and room_3), go to blue_door_1 in room_3 (gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_1).

5. Toggle blue_door_1 to unlock it.

6. Now go to room_1 via blue_door_1.

7. In room_1, collect purple_ball_1. But need to be in front of it. So gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_1.

8. Pick up purple_ball_1.

Then, need to take it to room_2. To get to room_2, need to go through yellow_door_1 (room_1 and room_2), which is locked. So:

9. In room_1, go to yellow_door_1 (gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2).

10. Toggle yellow_door_1 to unlock.

11. Go to room_2 via yellow_door_1.

12. Drop purple_ball_1 in room_2. So drop purple_ball_1 room_2.

Now, the constraint that purple_ball_1 is in room_2 is satisfied before unlocking red_door_1.

Then, need to get to red_door_1. Since red_door_1 connects room_2 and room_4. So in room_2, can go to red_door_1.

13. In room_2, goto red_door_1 (gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_4).

But wait, the agent is in room_2. So gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_4.

Then, toggle red_door_1 (which was initially locked, but maybe we need to unlock it here).

Wait, the initial state has red_door_1 locked. If the agent unlocks it here, that would satisfy the requirement for the final goal (unlocked). But also, the constraint that red_door_1 must be unlocked at some state, and in the final state, it needs to be unlocked. So after toggling it here, it becomes unlocked. Then, the agent is in front of it, so the final goal is achieved. But the final goal requires "you are in front of d" and "d is not locked". So if after unlocking it, the agent is in front of it, that's the goal.

But wait, the steps so far would have the agent in room_2, in front of red_door_1, which is now unlocked. But the agent is in room_2. The final goal is to be in front of a red door that's unlocked. So that's achieved here. But maybe the problem requires the agent to be in front of red_door_1 in room_4? Or any room. The door connects two rooms, so being in front of it from either room is okay.

So steps 1-13:

But let's check the constraints again.

Constraints:

1. red_door_1 must be locked in at least one state. Initial state has it locked. So that's covered.

2. If red_door_1 is locked in state s, then in s or after, grey_door_1 must be not locked. In the initial state, grey_door_1 is locked, so that's a problem. Because in the initial state, red_door_1 is locked, so the constraint requires that in that state or after, grey_door_1 is not locked. But in the initial state, grey_door_1 is locked, so the agent must unlock grey_door_1 after the initial state. So in the plan, after the initial state, the agent must unlock grey_door_1. So step 2 in the previous plan (toggle grey_door_1) unlocks it, satisfying the condition. Then, in any state after that, grey_door_1 is unlocked. So the initial state's red_door_1 is locked, and the next state after step 2, grey_door_1 is unlocked. So that satisfies the constraint.

3. red_door_1 must be unlocked in at least one state. That happens when the agent toggles it in step 13.

4. If red_door_1 is unlocked in some state, there must be an earlier state where purple_ball_1 is in room_2. After step 12, purple_ball_1 is in room_2, which is before unlocking red_door_1 in step 13. So that's satisfied.

5. The agent must be in front of red_door_1 at least once. That's step 13.

6. When in front of red_door_1, there must have been an earlier state in front of blue_door_1. The agent was in front of blue_door_1 in step 4 (gotodoor blue_door_1 in room_3), so that's satisfied.

7. yellow_door_1 must be unlocked in some state. That happens in step 10 when the agent toggles it.

8. The agent must be holding some object in at least one state. That happens when they pick up purple_ball_1 in step 8.

So this plan seems to satisfy all constraints.

But wait, let's check if the plan actually gets to the final goal. The final step after step 13 is toggling red_door_1. If red_door_1 was initially locked, then toggling it would unlock it. Then, the agent is in front of red_door_1 in room_2, which is unlocked. So the final goal is achieved. But do we need to ensure that after toggling, the door is unlocked and the agent is in front of it. So yes.

But the plan needs to end when the goal is achieved. The goal is a door d (red) that is unlocked, and the agent is in front of it. So after step 13 (toggle red_door_1), the agent is in front of red_door_1 in room_2, which is now unlocked. So that's the final state.

But wait, in the step 13, after toggling red_door_1, the door is unlocked. So the final state would have the agent in front of red_door_1, which is unlocked. So that satisfies the goal.

But let's check the order of steps. Let's outline the steps again with action names:

1. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3
2. toggle grey_door_1
3. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1
4. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_1
5. toggle blue_door_1
6. gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_1
7. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_1
8. pick purple_ball_1 room_1
9. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2
10. toggle yellow_door_1
11. gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1
12. drop purple_ball_1 room_2
13. gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_4
14. toggle red_door_1

Wait, after step 14, the agent toggles red_door_1, which was locked. So toggling it would unlock it. Then, the agent is in front of red_door_1 (since step 13 is gotodoor, which puts them in front, and step 14 is toggle, which requires being in front. So after step 14, the door is unlocked, and the agent is still in front of it. So that's the goal.

But let's check the constraints again. Let's see:

- The agent must be holding an object at some point. Step 8-12: they are holding purple_ball_1 until they drop it. So step 8-12 covers that.

- yellow_door_1 must be unlocked in some state. Step 10 toggles it from locked to unlocked.

- red_door_1 must be locked in at least one state (initial state counts) and unlocked in at least one (step 14).

- The constraint about red_door_1 and grey_door_1: when red_door_1 is locked (initially), grey_door_1 is also locked. But the constraint says if red_door_1 is locked in some state s, then in s or after, grey_door_1 must be not locked. So the initial state violates this unless we unlock grey_door_1 later. But since in the plan, step 2 unlocks grey_door_1, after the initial state. So in the initial state, red_door_1 is locked, and grey_door_1 is locked. But after step 2, grey_door_1 is unlocked. So the constraint is satisfied because after the initial state (s), there's a state (after step 2) where grey_door_1 is unlocked. So the initial state's s (where red_door_1 is locked) is followed by a state where grey_door_1 is not locked. So that's okay.

So this plan should work. Let's count the steps. The steps are:

1. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3
2. toggle grey_door_1
3. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1
4. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_1
5. toggle blue_door_1
6. gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_1
7. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_1
8. pick purple_ball_1 room_1
9. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2
10. toggle yellow_door_1
11. gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1
12. drop purple_ball_1 room_2
13. gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_4
14. toggle red_door_1

Is there a shorter path? For example, could the agent go directly to unlock red_door_1 first? But then the constraint about being in front of blue_door_1 before red_door_1 would not be met. Because to unlock red_door_1, the agent would have to be in front of it in room_4. Then, the agent would need to have been in front of blue_door_1 earlier. But in that scenario, how would they reach blue_door_1?

Alternatively, perhaps unlock red_door_1 first, then move to room_2, then proceed. But then the agent would need to have been in front of blue_door_1 before being in front of red_door_1, which isn't possible if they first go to red_door_1. So the initial approach seems necessary.

Another thought: Maybe after unlocking grey_door_1 and moving to room_3, the agent can go to room_4 via grey_door_1 again. But not sure.

Wait, another possible path:

Starting in room_4, go to grey_door_1, unlock it, move to room_3, unlock blue_door_1, move to room_1, get the ball, take it to room_2 via yellow_door_1 (unlocking it), then drop the ball. Then go to red_door_1 in room_2, unlock it, and be in front of it. That's the same as before.

Alternatively, after dropping the ball in room_2, the agent can go to red_door_1, toggle it (unlock), which meets the goal. Yes.

But the plan outlined earlier does that. So the steps are correct.

Now, checking if all preconditions are met:

For example, step 1: gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3. The agent is in room_4, which is connected via grey_door_1 to room_3. There's no object blocking the door in room_4. So that's allowed. Then toggle requires being in front of the door. After step 1, the agent is in front of grey_door_1. So step 2 is allowed. Then gotoroom to room_3. Since grey_door_1 is now unlocked. So step 3 is allowed.

Then step 4: gotodoor blue_door_1 in room_3. The agent is in room_3, which is connected to room_1 via blue_door_1. No blocking objects. Then toggle to unlock. Then gotoroom to room_1. Then steps 7-14 follow.

Yes, preconditions are met.

So this plan should be valid and optimal. Let's count the steps. 14 actions. Is there a shorter way? For example, combining some steps. Maybe after step 3 (in room_3), can the agent go directly to blue_door_1 and unlock it, then go to room_1, pick up the ball, then go back through room_3, grey_door_1 to room_4, then to room_2 via red_door_1? But that would require more steps.

Alternatively, after dropping the ball in room_2, the agent needs to be in front of red_door_1. So steps 13-14 are necessary. So I think the plan is optimal.
