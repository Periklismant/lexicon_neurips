Let me break down the planning problem:

**World Layout:**
- We have a 2D gridworld with 4 rooms: room_1 (NW), room_2 (SW), room_3 (NE), room_4 (SE).
- Doors connect: room_1-room_2, room_1-room_3, room_2-room_4, room_3-room_4.
- Each door, box, ball has a color.

**Actions:**
- gotoobject x r: Go in front of object x in room r.
- gotoempty: Go in front of an empty position of the room.
- gotodoor d r1 r2: Go in front of door d connecting rooms r1 and r2.
- gotoroom r1 r2 d: Move from room r1 to room r2 using door d.
- pick x r: Pick up object x in room r.
- drop x r: Drop object x in room r.
- toggle d: Lock/unlock door d.

**Initial State:**
- We start in room_4.
- purple_ball_1, grey_ball_1, purple_ball_2 are in room_1.
- purple_box_1, red_ball_1 are in room_2.
- green_box_1, blue_box_1, red_ball_2 are in room_4.
- All doors (yellow_door_1, blue_door_1, red_door_1, grey_door_1) are locked.
- We're not holding anything.
- We've only visited room_4 so far.

**Goal:**
- Find a door d such that:
  - d is red
  - we're in front of d
  - d is not locked

**Constraints:**
1. At some point, red_door_1 must be locked.
2. If red_door_1 is locked at some state, grey_door_1 must not be locked at that state or later.
3. At some point, red_door_1 must be unlocked.
4. If red_door_1 is unlocked at any point, purple_ball_1 must be in room_2 in an earlier state.
5. At some point, we must be in front of red_door_1.
6. If we're in front of red_door_1, we must have been in front of blue_door_1 earlier.
7. At some point, yellow_door_1 must be unlocked.
8. At some point, we must be holding an object.

Let's think about the solution:

1. First, the red door connects room_2 and room_4. To get in front of it, we need to be in one of these rooms.
2. To unlock the red door, it seems we need to move purple_ball_1 from room_1 to room_2.
3. To get to room_1, we'll need to unlock at least one of the doors (yellow_door_1 or blue_door_1).
4. Given the constraints, if red_door_1 is locked, grey_door_1 must be unlocked at some point. This means we might need to toggle grey_door_1 to unlock it.
5. Also, if we're going to be in front of red_door_1, we first need to be in front of blue_door_1. So it seems we'll have to visit room_1 or room_3.
6. One of the constraints also says we need to be holding an object at some point.

Let's try to come up with a plan:

1. We start in room_4. We need to unlock grey_door_1 to reach room_3, or unlock red_door_1 to reach room_2. But since red_door_1 requires purple_ball_1 to be in room_2 first, let's start with grey_door_1.
2. Go to grey_door_1 in room_4, connecting room_4 and room_3: gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3
3. Toggle it to unlock: toggle grey_door_1
4. Go to room_3 using grey_door_1: gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1
5. Now we're in room_3. We need to go to blue_door_1 to satisfy constraint 6: gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_1
6. Unlock blue_door_1: toggle blue_door_1
7. Go to room_1 using blue_door_1: gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_1
8. Now we're in room_1. We need to pick up purple_ball_1: gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_1
9. Pick it up: pick purple_ball_1 room_1
10. Now, we need to go to room_2 to drop the ball there. We can either go back to room_3 and then to room_4 and then to room_2, or we can directly go to room_2 through yellow_door_1: gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2
11. Unlock yellow_door_1: toggle yellow_door_1
12. Go to room_2 using yellow_door_1: gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1
13. Drop the ball in room_2: drop purple_ball_1 room_2
14. Now, we need to go to red_door_1: gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_4
15. Unlock red_door_1: toggle red_door_1

At this point, we've satisfied most of the constraints:
- red_door_1 was locked initially, and now it's unlocked.
- Before unlocking red_door_1, we made sure purple_ball_1 was in room_2.
- We're now in front of red_door_1.
- Before being in front of red_door_1, we were in front of blue_door_1.
- We've unlocked yellow_door_1.
- We've held an object (purple_ball_1).
- Since red_door_1 was locked, we've also made sure grey_door_1 is not locked.

Ok, I think our goal is actually to:
- Be in front of red_door_1
- red_door_1 is unlocked

So if we look at our plan:
1. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3
2. toggle grey_door_1
3. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1
4. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_1
5. toggle blue_door_1
6. gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_1
7. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_1
8. pick purple_ball_1 room_1
9. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2
10. toggle yellow_door_1
11. gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1
12. drop purple_ball_1 room_2
13. gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_4
14. toggle red_door_1

Actually, now that I think about it, we don't have to handle constraint #1 since red_door_1 is initially locked anyway. 

But let me double-check all the constraints to make sure our plan meets them:

1. At some point, red_door_1 must be locked. 
   - Yes, red_door_1 is locked initially, so this is satisfied.

2. If red_door_1 is locked at some state, grey_door_1 must not be locked at that state or later.
   - Initially, both red_door_1 and grey_door_1 are locked.
   - In our plan, we unlock grey_door_1 early on, ensuring that it's not locked for most of the plan, including when red_door_1 is still locked. So, this is satisfied.

3. At some point, red_door_1 must be unlocked.
   - Yes, we do this at the end of our plan. This is satisfied.

4. If red_door_1 is unlocked at any point, purple_ball_1 must be in room_2 in an earlier state.
   - In our plan, we move purple_ball_1 to room_2 before unlocking red_door_1. This is satisfied.

5. At some point, we must be in front of red_door_1.
   - Yes, we do this at the end of our plan. This is satisfied.

6. If we're in front of red_door_1, we must have been in front of blue_door_1 earlier.
   - In our plan, we're in front of blue_door_1 before being in front of red_door_1. This is satisfied.

7. At some point, yellow_door_1 must be unlocked.
   - In our plan, we unlock yellow_door_1. This is satisfied.

8. At some point, we must be holding an object.
   - Yes, we pick up purple_ball_1 in our plan. This is satisfied.

Our plan satisfies all the constraints. Let's make sure it's optimal (minimal number of steps):

Could we have a shorter path? Let's think about the major constraints:

1. We need to be in front of red_door_1, and it needs to be unlocked.
2. Before unlocking red_door_1, purple_ball_1 must be in room_2.
3. Before being in front of red_door_1, we must have been in front of blue_door_1.

This means:
- We need to go to room_1 to get purple_ball_1.
- We need to go to room_2 to drop purple_ball_1.
- We need to stand in front of blue_door_1 before standing in front of red_door_1.

Starting from room_4, we can:
1. Go to room_3 via grey_door_1.
2. Go to room_1 via blue_door_1.
3. Pick up purple_ball_1.
4. Go to room_2 via yellow_door_1.
5. Drop purple_ball_1.
6. Stand in front of red_door_1.
7. Unlock red_door_1.

This seems like the most direct route, and it aligns with our original plan. So, our plan is optimal.

Let's make sure our actions follow the allowed format and have the correct arguments:

1. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3
2. toggle grey_door_1
3. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1
4. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_1
5. toggle blue_door_1
6. gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_1
7. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_1
8. pick purple_ball_1 room_1
9. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2
10. toggle yellow_door_1
11. gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1
12. drop purple_ball_1 room_2
13. gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_4
14. toggle red_door_1

That should be a valid and optimal plan for this problem.

Hmm, wait. I realized that constraint 2 says: If red_door_1 is locked at some state, grey_door_1 must not be locked at that state or later.

But in the initial state, both doors are locked. This means we need to make sure grey_door_1 is unlocked as early as possible in our plan.

So, our plan is:
1. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3  # Go to grey_door_1.
2. toggle grey_door_1  # Unlock grey_door_1 to satisfy constraint 2.
3. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1  # Go to room_3.
4. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_1  # Go to blue_door_1 to satisfy constraint 6.
5. toggle blue_door_1  # Unlock blue_door_1.
6. gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_1  # Go to room_1.
7. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_1  # Go to purple_ball_1.
8. pick purple_ball_1 room_1  # Pick up purple_ball_1 to satisfy constraint 8.
9. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2  # Go to yellow_door_1.
10. toggle yellow_door_1  # Unlock yellow_door_1 to satisfy constraint 7.
11. gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1  # Go to room_2.
12. drop purple_ball_1 room_2  # Drop purple_ball_1 in room_2 to satisfy constraint 4.
13. gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_4  # Go to red_door_1 to satisfy constraint 5.
14. toggle red_door_1  # Unlock red_door_1 to satisfy constraint 3 and the goal.

Wait, I realized I'm wrong in my interpretation. Constraint 2 says: "If expression 'red_door_1 is locked' holds in some state s, then expression 'grey_door_1 is not locked' must hold at s or at some state after s."

This means that after a state where red_door_1 is locked, there must be a state (either the same state or a later one) where grey_door_1 is not locked.

Now, initially, both doors are locked. But our plan ensures that at a later state, grey_door_1 is unlocked while red_door_1 is still locked, which satisfies the constraint.

So, our original plan is correct.

Let's trace through the plan one more time to make sure it satisfies the goal and all constraints:

Starting state:
- We're in room_4.
- purple_ball_1, grey_ball_1, purple_ball_2 are in room_1.
- purple_box_1, red_ball_1 are in room_2.
- green_box_1, blue_box_1, red_ball_2 are in room_4.
- All doors (yellow_door_1, blue_door_1, red_door_1, grey_door_1) are locked.
- We're not holding anything.

1. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3: We move in front of grey_door_1 in room_4.
2. toggle grey_door_1: We unlock grey_door_1.
   - Satisfies constraint 2: "If red_door_1 is locked in some state, grey_door_1 must not be locked in that state or later."
3. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1: We move to room_3.
4. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_1: We move in front of blue_door_1 in room_3.
   - This is necessary for constraint 6.
5. toggle blue_door_1: We unlock blue_door_1.
6. gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_1: We move to room_1.
7. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_1: We move in front of purple_ball_1 in room_1.
8. pick purple_ball_1 room_1: We pick up purple_ball_1.
   - Satisfies constraint 8: "At some point, you must be holding an object."
9. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2: We move in front of yellow_door_1 in room_1.
10. toggle yellow_door_1: We unlock yellow_door_1.
    - Satisfies constraint 7: "At some point, yellow_door_1 must be unlocked."
11. gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1: We move to room_2.
12. drop purple_ball_1 room_2: We drop purple_ball_1 in room_2.
    - Crucial for constraint 4.
13. gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_4: We move in front of red_door_1 in room_2.
    - Satisfies constraint 5: "At some point, we must be in front of red_door_1."
    - And because we've been in front of blue_door_1 earlier, it also satisfies constraint 6.
14. toggle red_door_1: We unlock red_door_1.
    - Satisfies constraint 3: "At some point, red_door_1 must be unlocked."
    - And because purple_ball_1 is in room_2 in an earlier state, it also satisfies constraint 4.

After these actions, we're in front of red_door_1, which is unlocked, and red_door_1 is, indeed, red. This satisfies the goal.

And all constraints are also satisfied. So, our plan is valid and optimal.

1. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_4 room_3
2. toggle grey_door_1
3. gotoroom room_4 room_3 grey_door_1
4. gotodoor blue_door_1 room_3 room_1
5. toggle blue_door_1
6. gotoroom room_3 room_1 blue_door_1
7. gotoobject purple_ball_1 room_1
8. pick purple_ball_1 room_1
9. gotodoor yellow_door_1 room_1 room_2
10. toggle yellow_door_1
11. gotoroom room_1 room_2 yellow_door_1
12. drop purple_ball_1 room_2
13. gotodoor red_door_1 room_2 room_4
14. toggle red_door_1
