I need to analyze the problem carefully to devise a valid plan that satisfies all the constraints.

First, let me understand the goal: I need to be in front of a grey box.

There are three grey objects in the world:
1. `grey_ball_1` in `room_1`
2. `grey_box_1` in `room_2`
3. `grey_box_2` in `room_4`

Since the goal specifically requires a box that is grey, I need to be in front of either `grey_box_1` or `grey_box_2`.

Now, let's examine the constraints:

1. "I must not be in `room_4` in any state" - This means I cannot use `grey_box_2` as my target since it's in `room_4`. So I must aim to be in front of `grey_box_1` in `room_2`.

2. "At some point, `green_door_1` must be locked" - This is already true in the initial state.

3. "If `green_door_1` is locked, then I must hold `red_box_2` in that state or later" - This means I need to pick up `red_box_2` at some point.

4. "At some point, `green_door_1` must be unlocked" - I need to unlock it.

5. "If `green_door_1` is unlocked, I must have held `red_box_2` in some earlier state" - This means I need to pick up `red_box_2` before unlocking `green_door_1`.

6. "At some point, I must be in front of `red_box_2`" - I need to go to `red_box_2` which is in `room_2`.

7. "At some point, I must be in `room_3`" - I'm already in `room_3` in the initial state, so this is satisfied.

8. "If I'm in `room_3`, then `red_door_1` must be unlocked or I must be holding some object" - Since I start in `room_3`, I need to ensure this condition is met early in my plan.

Starting from the initial state, I'm in `room_3` and need to satisfy constraint 8. Since `red_door_1` is locked, I need to pick up some object. I could pick up either `blue_box_1` or `purple_box_1` which are in the same room.

Then, I need to reach `room_2` to find both `grey_box_1` (my goal) and `red_box_2` (required by constraints 3 and 5).

To reach `room_2` from `room_3`, I can either:
- Go through `room_1` (using `grey_door_1` and then `purple_door_1`)
- Go through `room_4` (using `green_door_1` and then `red_door_1`)

Since I can't enter `room_4` (constraint 1), I must go through `room_1`.

Let me outline a plan:

1. In `room_3`, pick up an object to satisfy constraint 8.
2. Unlock `grey_door_1` to go from `room_3` to `room_1`.
3. Go to `room_1`.
4. Unlock `purple_door_1` to go from `room_1` to `room_2`.
5. Go to `room_2`.
6. Drop the object I'm holding (since I'll need empty hands to pick up `red_box_2`).
7. Go to `red_box_2` and pick it up (to satisfy constraints 3, 5, and 6).
8. Go to `green_door_1` and unlock it (to satisfy constraint 4, and constraint 5 is satisfied because I've already held `red_box_2`).
9. Finally, go to `grey_box_1` (to satisfy the goal).

However, there's a potential issue with step 8. I need to unlock `green_door_1`, but it connects `room_3` and `room_4`. Since I can't go to `room_4` (constraint 1), I would need to be in `room_3` to unlock it. But I would be in `room_2` at that point.

Let me reconsider the plan...

Actually, I don't necessarily need to physically unlock `green_door_1`. I just need a state where `green_door_1` is not locked (constraint 4). Let me think more about this...

Ah, I realized that the action "toggle d" allows me to unlock a door if I am in front of it. So I need to go in front of `green_door_1` from `room_3` (since I can't enter `room_4`), and then toggle it.

Let me refine the plan:

1. In `room_3`, go to `blue_box_1` and pick it up (to satisfy constraint 8).
2. Go to `grey_door_1` and unlock it.
3. Go to `room_1` via `grey_door_1`.
4. Go to `purple_door_1` and unlock it.
5. Go to `room_2` via `purple_door_1`.
6. Drop `blue_box_1` (to have empty hands).
7. Go to `red_box_2` and pick it up (to satisfy constraints 3, 5, and 6).
8. Go to `purple_door_1`.
9. Go to `room_1` via `purple_door_1`.
10. Go to `grey_door_1`.
11. Go to `room_3` via `grey_door_1`.
12. Go to `green_door_1` and unlock it (to satisfy constraint 4, with constraint 5 satisfied because I'm holding `red_box_2`).
13. Go back to `grey_door_1`.
14. Go to `room_1` via `grey_door_1`.
15. Go to `purple_door_1`.
16. Go to `room_2` via `purple_door_1`.
17. Drop `red_box_2`.
18. Go to `grey_box_1` (to satisfy the goal).

But there's another approach which might be more efficient. After unlocking `green_door_1` in step 12, I could lock it again (ensuring constraint 2 is satisfied at a state after constraint 4). This would allow me to complete the goal more directly:

1. In `room_3`, go to `blue_box_1` and pick it up (to satisfy constraint 8).
2. Go to `grey_door_1` and unlock it.
3. Go to `room_1` via `grey_door_1`.
4. Go to `purple_door_1` and unlock it.
5. Go to `room_2` via `purple_door_1`.
6. Drop `blue_box_1` (to have empty hands).
7. Go to `red_box_2` and pick it up (to satisfy constraints 3, 5, and 6).
8. Go to `purple_door_1`.
9. Go to `room_1` via `purple_door_1`.
10. Go to `grey_door_1`.
11. Go to `room_3` via `grey_door_1`.
12. Go to `green_door_1`.
13. Toggle `green_door_1` to unlock it (satisfying constraint 4, with constraint 5 satisfied because I'm holding `red_box_2`).
14. Toggle `green_door_1` again to lock it (ensuring constraint 2 is satisfied at a state after constraint 4).
15. Go back to `grey_door_1`.
16. Go to `room_1` via `grey_door_1`.
17. Go to `purple_door_1`.
18. Go to `room_2` via `purple_door_1`.
19. Drop `red_box_2`.
20. Go to `grey_box_1` (to satisfy the goal).

Wait, I think I can simplify the plan a bit more. Instead of picking up `blue_box_1` and then dropping it to pick up `red_box_2`, I can directly go to `room_2` to pick up `red_box_2`, which would satisfy constraint 3 and 8 (by holding an object while in `room_3`). However, this would mean that constraint 8 ("If I'm in `room_3`, then `red_door_1` must be unlocked or I must be holding some object") wouldn't be immediately satisfied at the start of the plan.

Let me think about it more...

In the initial state, I'm in `room_3`, but I'm not holding any object and `red_door_1` is locked. This means constraint 8 is not satisfied in the initial state. However, the constraint states, "If expression 'you are in room_3' holds in some state s, then expression 'At least one of the following conditions is true: red_door_1 is not locked, you are holding some object' must hold at s or at some state after s."

So, it's fine if I ensure I'm holding some object as soon as possible after the plan starts. Let's refine the plan one more time:

1. In `room_3`, go to `blue_box_1` and pick it up (to ensure constraint 8 is satisfied right away).
2. Go to `grey_door_1` and unlock it.
3. Go to `room_1` via `grey_door_1`.
4. Go to `purple_door_1` and unlock it.
5. Go to `room_2` via `purple_door_1`.
6. Drop `blue_box_1` (to have empty hands).
7. Go to `red_box_2` and pick it up (to satisfy constraints 3, 5, and 6).
8. Go to `purple_door_1`.
9. Go to `room_1` via `purple_door_1`.
10. Go to `grey_door_1`.
11. Go to `room_3` via `grey_door_1`.
12. Go to `green_door_1` (which connects `room_3` and `room_4`).
13. Toggle `green_door_1` to unlock it (satisfying constraint 4, with constraint 5 satisfied because I'm holding `red_box_2`).
14. Toggle `green_door_1` again to lock it (ensuring constraint 2 is satisfied at a state after constraint 4).
15. Go back to `grey_door_1`.
16. Go to `room_1` via `grey_door_1`.
17. Go to `purple_door_1`.
18. Go to `room_2` via `purple_door_1`.
19. Drop `red_box_2`.
20. Go to `grey_box_1` (to satisfy the goal).

The plan looks good. Let me formalize it according to the required action format.

Wait, I need to make one more adjustment. The action `gotoobject x r` requires me to specify the room I'm in. Similarly, for `pick x r` and `drop x r`, I need to specify the room.

Also, I need to ensure that if I've satisfied all the constraints I've mentioned.

Let's double-check:
1. "I must not be in `room_4` in any state" - I never enter `room_4` in the plan, so this is satisfied.
2. "At some point, `green_door_1` must be locked" - It's locked in the initial state and I lock it again after unlocking it, so this is satisfied.
3. "If `green_door_1` is locked, then I must hold `red_box_2` in that state or later" - I pick up `red_box_2` and continue to hold it when I lock `green_door_1`, so this is satisfied.
4. "At some point, `green_door_1` must be unlocked" - I unlock it, so this is satisfied.
5. "If `green_door_1` is unlocked, I must have held `red_box_2` in some earlier state" - I pick up `red_box_2` before unlocking `green_door_1`, so this is satisfied.
6. "At some point, I must be in front of `red_box_2`" - I go to `red_box_2` to pick it up, so this is satisfied.
7. "At some point, I must be in `room_3`" - I start in `room_3` and return to it later, so this is satisfied.
8. "If I'm in `room_3`, then `red_door_1` must be unlocked or I must be holding some object" - In the initial state and when I return to `room_3`, I'm holding an object, so this is satisfied.

I believe the plan is valid and satisfies all the constraints!

Let me write it in the proper format.

1. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_3
2. pick blue_box_1 room_3
3. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1
4. toggle grey_door_1
5. gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1
6. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2
7. toggle purple_door_1
8. gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1
9. gotoempty
10. drop blue_box_1 room_2
11. gotoobject red_box_2 room_2
12. pick red_box_2 room_2
13. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1
14. gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1
15. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_3
16. gotoroom room_1 room_3 grey_door_1
17. gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4
18. toggle green_door_1
19. toggle green_door_1
20. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1
21. gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1
22. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2
23. gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1
24. gotoempty
25. drop red_box_2 room_2
26. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_2

Actually, I need to make sure the plan is optimal. Let me see if there are any unnecessary actions.

1. I pick up `blue_box_1` to satisfy constraint 8, which is required.
2. I need to go through `room_1` to reach `room_2`, which requires unlocking `grey_door_1` and `purple_door_1`.
3. I need to drop `blue_box_1` to pick up `red_box_2`.
4. I need to pick up `red_box_2` to satisfy constraints 3, 5, and 6.
5. I need to return to `room_3` and toggle `green_door_1` to satisfy constraints 4 and 2.
6. I need to return to `room_2` and be in front of `grey_box_1` to satisfy the goal.

Everything seems necessary. Actually, maybe I could optimize steps 8 and 9 - can I drop an item without going to an empty position first? Let me re-read the action effects.

According to the action description, "drop x r" has the precondition that "the position in front of you is empty". So, I need to first go to an empty position before dropping the object.

Actually, I think we can skip the second toggle of `green_door_1` (step 19). Constraint 2 states that "green_door_1 is locked" must hold in at least one state. Since `green_door_1` is locked in the initial state, this constraint is already satisfied. We don't need to lock it again after unlocking it.

Let me revise the plan:

1. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_3
2. pick blue_box_1 room_3
3. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1
4. toggle grey_door_1
5. gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1
6. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2
7. toggle purple_door_1
8. gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1
9. gotoempty
10. drop blue_box_1 room_2
11. gotoobject red_box_2 room_2
12. pick red_box_2 room_2
13. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1
14. gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1
15. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_3
16. gotoroom room_1 room_3 grey_door_1
17. gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4
18. toggle green_door_1
19. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1
20. gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1
21. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2
22. gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1
23. gotoempty
24. drop red_box_2 room_2
25. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_2

Upon re-reading, I'm a bit uncertain about Constraint 2 and 3. Constraint 2 says that "green_door_1 is locked" must hold in at least one state. This is already true in the initial state. Constraint 3 says that if "green_door_1 is locked" holds in some state s, then "you are holding red_box_2" must hold at s or at some state after s.

Since "green_door_1 is locked" holds in the initial state, I need to ensure I pick up "red_box_2" at some point. I'm doing that, so Constraint 3 is satisfied.

I think the plan is optimal and satisfies all the constraints.

Hmm, I'm still not 100% sure if I'm interpreting the constraint correctly, or if I need to make sure I re-lock the green door. Let's look at constraints 2 and 3 again:

2. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'green_door_1 is locked'"
3. "If expression 'green_door_1 is locked' holds in some state s, then expression 'you are holding red_box_2' must hold at s or at some state after s"

I'm interpreting this to mean that at some point during the plan, "green_door_1" must be locked. And if "green_door_1" is locked at some state s, then I must be holding "red_box_2" at state s or afterwards.

In the initial state, "green_door_1" is locked. I'm not holding "red_box_2" in the initial state, but I do pick it up later, which satisfies constraint 3.

But here's another way to interpret it: Maybe I need to ensure there's a state where both "green_door_1 is locked" and "I am holding red_box_2". If that's the case, I should indeed re-lock "green_door_1" after unlocking it, while still holding "red_box_2".

To be safe, let's include the step to re-lock "green_door_1". I originally had it as step 19 in the earlier version of the plan.

1. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_3
2. pick blue_box_1 room_3
3. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1
4. toggle grey_door_1
5. gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1
6. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2
7. toggle purple_door_1
8. gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1
9. gotoempty
10. drop blue_box_1 room_2
11. gotoobject red_box_2 room_2
12. pick red_box_2 room_2
13. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1
14. gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1
15. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_3
16. gotoroom room_1 room_3 grey_door_1
17. gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4
18. toggle green_door_1
19. toggle green_door_1
20. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1
21. gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1
22. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2
23. gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1
24. gotoempty
25. drop red_box_2 room_2
26. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_2

Wait, let me read constraints 4 and 5 too to understand the context better:

4. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'green_door_1 is not locked'"
5. "If expression 'green_door_1 is not locked' holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: 'you are holding red_box_2'"

This confirms my earlier understanding. Constraints 2, 3, 4, and 5 together mean:
- At some point, "green_door_1" must be locked. (This is true in the initial state.)
- If "green_door_1" is locked at state s, I must hold "red_box_2" at state s or later. (I pick up "red_box_2" after the initial state.)
- At some point, "green_door_1" must be unlocked. (I unlock it in step 18.)
- If "green_door_1" is unlocked at state s, I must have held "red_box_2" at some state before s. (I pick up "red_box_2" before unlocking the door.)

I don't think I need to re-lock "green_door_1" for the constraints to be satisfied. So I will remove step 19.

Let's get back to the plan:

1. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_3
2. pick blue_box_1 room_3
3. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1
4. toggle grey_door_1
5. gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1
6. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2
7. toggle purple_door_1
8. gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1
9. gotoempty
10. drop blue_box_1 room_2
11. gotoobject red_box_2 room_2
12. pick red_box_2 room_2
13. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1
14. gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1
15. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_3
16. gotoroom room_1 room_3 grey_door_1
17. gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4
18. toggle green_door_1
19. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1
20. gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1
21. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2
22. gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1
23. gotoempty
24. drop red_box_2 room_2
25. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_2

But wait, if I look at constraint 3: "If expression 'green_door_1 is locked' holds in some state s, then expression 'you are holding red_box_2' must hold at s or at some state after s". Since "green_door_1 is locked" is true in the initial state, I'm now obligated to pick up "red_box_2" at some point. But if I re-lock "green_door_1" (by toggling it again after unlocking it), I'd create another state where "green_door_1 is locked", and by constraint 3, I'd need to be holding "red_box_2" at that state or after.

Since I'll be holding "red_box_2" when I toggle "green_door_1" to unlock it, I will also be holding it if I toggle it again to lock it. And I continue to hold it until I drop it in "room_2". So the constraint would still be satisfied.

But truly, if green_door_1 is locked and unlocked at specific times, holding red_box_2 at the right times, satisfies these constraints.

Let's try once more with clear thinking.
In the initial state:
- "green_door_1 is locked" is true (satisfying constraint 2)
- I'm not holding "red_box_2"

As per constraint 3, if "green_door_1 is locked" is true at a state s, then I must hold "red_box_2" at state s or at some state after s. So, I need to pick up "red_box_2" at some point during my plan.

By constraint 4, at some point, "green_door_1 is not locked" must be true. So, I need to unlock "green_door_1" at some point.

By constraint 5, if "green_door_1 is not locked" is true at a state s, then I must have held "red_box_2" at some state before s. So, I need to pick up "red_box_2" before unlocking "green_door_1".

Given these constraints, I can either:
1. Unlock "green_door_1" and leave it unlocked.
2. Unlock "green_door_1" and then lock it again.

Both approaches would satisfy the constraints. The first approach is more efficient (requires fewer steps). I was mistakenly overcomplicating the problem.

So, the optimal plan is:

1. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_3
2. pick blue_box_1 room_3
3. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1
4. toggle grey_door_1
5. gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1
6. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2
7. toggle purple_door_1
8. gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1
9. gotoempty
10. drop blue_box_1 room_2
11. gotoobject red_box_2 room_2
12. pick red_box_2 room_2
13. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1
14. gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1
15. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_3
16. gotoroom room_1 room_3 grey_door_1
17. gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4
18. toggle green_door_1
19. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1
20. gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1
21. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2
22. gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1
23. gotoempty
24. drop red_box_2 room_2
25. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_2
