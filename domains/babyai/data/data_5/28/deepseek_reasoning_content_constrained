Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. The goal is to get a grey box in front of the agent, and there are a bunch of constraints to satisfy. Let me start by understanding all the requirements and the initial state.

First, the initial state: The agent is in room_3. The objects are spread across rooms. The grey boxes are grey_box_1 in room_2 and grey_box_2 in room_4. But the constraint says the agent can never be in room_4. So grey_box_2 is out of reach. So the only possible grey box to target is grey_box_1 in room_2. So the final goal is to be in front of grey_box_1 in room_2.

Now, the constraints:

1. Always not in room_4. So any action that involves moving to room_4 is forbidden. So the agent can't go through doors connecting to room_4, like red_door_1 (room_2-room_4) and green_door_1 (room_3-room_4). But wait, the agent starts in room_3. To get to room_2, maybe via room_1? Let me check the door connections.

Doors:
- purple_door_1 connects room_1 and room_2.
- grey_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3.
- red_door_1 connects room_2 and room_4.
- green_door_1 connects room_3 and room_4.

So the agent is in room_3 initially. To get to room_2, possible paths: room_3 → room_1 via grey_door_1, then room_1 → room_2 via purple_door_1. But all doors are locked initially. So need to unlock them.

But here's the problem: the agent is in room_3. The doors connected to room_3 are grey_door_1 (to room_1) and green_door_1 (to room_4). Since green_door_1 leads to room_4, which is forbidden, the agent can't use that. So the only way out of room_3 is through grey_door_1 to room_1, but that door is locked. So first, the agent needs to unlock grey_door_1. To toggle a door, the agent must be in front of it. So the agent needs to go to grey_door_1 in room_3. But wait, doors are between rooms. For example, grey_door_1 connects room_1 and room_3. So to go to grey_door_1, the agent can be in room_3 and use gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1? Wait, the gotodoor action requires that the agent is in a room connected by the door. So if the agent is in room_3, then gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1 would be possible, provided that there's no object blocking the position in front of the door. But the initial state in room_3 has blue_box_1 and purple_box_1. Are any of these blocking the door? The problem statement mentions that doors can be blocked by objects. The initial state doesn't explicitly state any blocking, so I assume that by default, doors are not blocked unless an object is in front. So the agent can go to the door if there's nothing blocking it.

Wait, the precondition for "gotodoor d r1 r2" is that the agent is in a room (r1 or r2?) connected by d, and there's no object blocking the position in front of d in the current room. So if the agent is in room_3, and wants to go to grey_door_1 (which connects room_1 and room_3), then the agent can do gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1, provided there's no object blocking the door's position in room_3. But the initial objects in room_3 are blue_box_1 and purple_box_1. Are they blocking the door? The problem statement doesn't say, but the initial state doesn't mention any blockages. So maybe the doors are not blocked. So the agent can perform gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1. Then toggle the door to unlock it. Then go through the door to room_1.

Once in room_1, the agent can then go to purple_door_1 (connecting room_1 and room_2), but that's locked. So need to unlock it. To do that, the agent needs to go to the door in room_1, toggle it. But first, check if the door's position is blocked. Room_1 has grey_ball_1, red_box_1, and green_ball_1. Are any of these blocking purple_door_1? Again, unless specified, assume not. So gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2, then toggle it to unlock. Then go to room_2 via gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1.

In room_2, the agent can then go to grey_box_1 and be in front of it. But the problem is the agent needs to pick up red_box_2 at some point because of the constraints related to green_door_1 being locked and unlocked. Wait, the constraints include:

- At least one state where green_door_1 is locked. But the agent can't go to room_4, so green_door_1 is in room_3 and room_4. Since the agent is in room_3 initially, but can't go to room_4. However, the toggle action can be done if the agent is in front of green_door_1. So maybe the agent needs to toggle green_door_1 at some point.

Wait, the constraints:

2. At least one state where green_door_1 is locked. But it's initially locked. So maybe that's already satisfied. But wait, the initial state has green_door_1 locked. So the first state (initial) already satisfies that. But the constraint says "in at least one state". So that's already covered. But then the third constraint: If green_door_1 is locked in some state s, then the agent must hold red_box_2 in s or after. So since the initial state has green_door_1 locked, the agent must hold red_box_2 at some point after the initial state. Because the initial state is s0, and the constraint is that if s is s0, then in s0 or after, the agent holds red_box_2. So the agent must pick up red_box_2 at some point.

Another constraint: At least one state where green_door_1 is not locked. So the agent must toggle green_door_1 to unlock it at some point. But to do that, the agent must be in front of green_door_1. But green_door_1 connects room_3 and room_4. So the agent can be in room_3 and go to green_door_1. So gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4. Then toggle it. But toggling it when it's locked would unlock it, so after toggling, it's unlocked. But then the agent must have previously held red_box_2, because the fifth constraint says that if green_door_1 is not locked in some state, there must be an earlier state where the agent was holding red_box_2. So the agent must pick up red_box_2 before unlocking green_door_1.

But red_box_2 is in room_2. So the agent needs to get to room_2, pick up red_box_2, then go back to room_3, toggle green_door_1 to unlock it (but wait, initially it's locked. Wait, the initial state says green_door_1 is locked. So the first toggle would unlock it. Then the agent must have held red_box_2 before that toggle. So the sequence would be:

Go from room_3 to room_1 via grey_door_1 (after unlocking it).

Then go from room_1 to room_2 via purple_door_1 (after unlocking it).

Pick up red_box_2 in room_2.

Then return to room_3 via the reverse path: room_2 → room_1 via purple_door_1, then room_1 → room_3 via grey_door_1.

Then go to green_door_1 in room_3 and toggle it (unlocking it), which would satisfy the "green_door_1 is not locked" in that state. But before that, the agent must have picked up red_box_2. So that's covered.

But also, after unlocking green_door_1, the agent must not go to room_4. So the agent can stay in room_3.

Additionally, the agent must be in front of red_box_2 at some state, which would be when they pick it up (after going to it). So that's covered.

Also, the agent must be in room_3 at least once. Well, the initial state is room_3. But another constraint says that if the agent is in room_3 in some state s, then in s or after, either red_door_1 is unlocked or the agent is holding something. Since red_door_1 is in room_2 and room_4, and the agent can't go to room_4, red_door_1 is in room_2. The agent might not need to interact with red_door_1. But when the agent is in room_3, during the initial steps, they might not have anything. So after moving to room_1 and room_2, when they return to room_3, they would be holding red_box_2. So that satisfies the condition that whenever in room_3, either red_door_1 is unlocked (but it's in room_2, so maybe not relevant) or the agent is holding something. Wait, but red_door_1 is in room_2 and room_4. So if the agent is in room_3, the red_door_1 is in room_2. So unless the agent is in room_2, the red_door_1's state isn't directly relevant. Hmm, maybe this constraint is tricky. Let me recheck:

The constraint is: If you are in room_3 in some state s, then in s or after, either red_door_1 is not locked or you are holding some object.

So whenever the agent is in room_3 (like the initial state, and after returning from room_2), in that state or any subsequent state, either red_door_1 is unlocked or the agent is holding something.

In the initial state, the agent is in room_3 and not holding anything. So to satisfy this, either in the initial state or after, the agent must hold something or red_door_1 is unlocked. But red_door_1 is locked initially. So in the initial state, the agent is in room_3, so they need to either unlock red_door_1 (but they can't because they can't get to room_2 or room_4 where that door is) or pick up an object. Wait, but the agent starts in room_3 with blue_box_1 and purple_box_1. So the agent could pick up one of those boxes. But then the constraints require that the agent eventually holds red_box_2. But maybe that's conflicting. Let me see.

Alternatively, after the initial state, when the agent leaves room_3, they go to room_1, then room_2, pick up red_box_2, then return to room_3. So when they come back to room_3, they are holding red_box_2, which satisfies the condition. So in any state where they are in room_3 after that, they are holding something. For example, when they return to room_3 after picking up red_box_2, they are holding it, so that's okay. The initial state is the only time they are in room_3 and not holding something. But the constraint says that if they are in room_3 in state s (like the initial state), then in s or after, they must hold something or red_door_1 is unlocked. So in the initial state, they are in room_3, not holding anything, and red_door_1 is locked. So they need to, after the initial state, either unlock red_door_1 (which they can't because it's in room_2 and room_4, and they can't get there yet) or pick up something. But since the agent's plan involves leaving room_3 to go to room_1 and room_2, and then returning to room_3 while holding red_box_2, that would satisfy the condition. Because after the initial state, when they are back in room_3, they are holding red_box_2. So any time they are in room_3 after that, they are holding something. The initial state's condition is handled by the subsequent actions where they pick up red_box_2. So the initial state's requirement is satisfied because after s0 (the initial state), the agent eventually holds red_box_2. So whenever they are in room_3 again (after s0), they are holding something.

So the steps would be:

1. In room_3, go to grey_door_1 (which connects room_3 and room_1). Use gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1. Then toggle to unlock it.

2. Gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1.

3. In room_1, go to purple_door_1 (room_1 to room_2), gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2. Toggle to unlock.

4. Gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1.

5. In room_2, go to red_box_2. Use gotoobject red_box_2 room_2. Then pick it up.

6. Now, the agent is holding red_box_2. Need to return to room_3 to toggle green_door_1. So go back to room_1 via purple_door_1 (unlocked now), then to room_3 via grey_door_1.

7. In room_3, go to green_door_1 (room_3 to room_4), but can't go to room_4. But just gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4. Then toggle it (unlocking it), which will satisfy the "green_door_1 is not locked" constraint, and since the agent is holding red_box_2, the earlier state (when they picked it up) satisfies the requirement.

But wait, the toggle action on green_door_1 when it's locked (initial state) would unlock it. So after toggling, green_door_1 is unlocked. But the agent needs to have held red_box_2 before this. Since they picked it up in room_2 before returning to room_3, that's okay.

Then, after unlocking green_door_1, the agent needs to go to room_2 to get to grey_box_1. Wait, the main goal is to be in front of a grey box. The grey boxes are grey_box_1 in room_2 and grey_box_2 in room_4 (but can't go there). So after returning to room_3 with red_box_2, the agent needs to go back to room_2 to be in front of grey_box_1. But since they are in room_3, they would need to go through room_1 again. But maybe there's a shorter path.

Wait, the agent is in room_3 after toggling green_door_1. Now, they need to go to room_2 to reach grey_box_1. The path would be room_3 → room_1 via grey_door_1 → room_2 via purple_door_1. Then gotoobject grey_box_1 room_2.

But the agent is holding red_box_2. To drop it somewhere? Or do they need to keep it? Because the constraints require that after green_door_1 is unlocked, the agent must have held red_box_2 before. But once they drop it, they might no longer be holding it. However, the constraint is only that in the state where green_door_1 is unlocked, there's an earlier state where the agent held red_box_2. So after dropping it, that's still satisfied.

But maybe the agent can drop red_box_2 in room_3 after unlocking green_door_1. Then proceed to room_2 to get grey_box_1.

So steps after step 7 (after toggling green_door_1):

8. Drop red_box_2 in room_3. But to drop, the agent must be in front of an empty position. So maybe do gotoempty in room_3, then drop.

But let's outline the full plan step by step:

Initial state: room_3, not holding anything.

1. gotoempty (in room_3) → not necessary, but maybe needed to be in front of something? Wait, the first action should be gotodoor to grey_door_1.

Wait, to toggle a door, you need to be in front of it. So:

Action 1: gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1 → moves in front of grey_door_1 in room_3.

Action 2: toggle grey_door_1 → unlocks it.

Action 3: gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1 → now in room_1.

Action 4: gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2 → front of purple_door_1 in room_1.

Action 5: toggle purple_door_1 → unlocks it.

Action 6: gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1 → now in room_2.

Action 7: gotoobject red_box_2 room_2 → front of red_box_2.

Action 8: pick red_box_2 room_2 → holding it.

Now, need to return to room_3 to toggle green_door_1.

Action 9: gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1 → front of purple_door_1 in room_2.

Action 10: gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1 → back to room_1.

Action 11: gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_3 → front of grey_door_1 in room_1.

Action 12: gotoroom room_1 room_3 grey_door_1 → back to room_3.

Now in room_3, holding red_box_2. Need to toggle green_door_1.

Action 13: gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4 → front of green_door_1 in room_3.

Action 14: toggle green_door_1 → unlocks it (since it was locked).

Now, the constraints related to green_door_1:

- At least one state where green_door_1 is locked: initial state and up to action 14, after which it's unlocked. So that's covered.

- If green_door_1 is locked in any state, then agent holds red_box_2 in that state or after. The initial state is a state where green_door_1 is locked, and after that, the agent picks up red_box_2 (action 8), so that's satisfied.

- At least one state where green_door_1 is not locked: after action 14.

- If green_door_1 is not locked (action 14's effect), then there's an earlier state where agent held red_box_2 (action 8). Yes.

- At least one state in front of red_box_2: action 7.

- At least one state in room_3: initial and after action 12.

- When in room_3 (initial state, action 12, action 13, etc.), after action 8, the agent is holding red_box_2 when back in room_3 (action 12 onwards). So in room_3 after action 12, the agent is holding red_box_2, which satisfies the condition.

Now, the main goal is to be in front of a grey box. The grey_box_1 is in room_2. So after action 14, the agent is in room_3, holding red_box_2. They need to go back to room_2 to reach grey_box_1.

But to go back, they need to go through room_1 again. But they are holding red_box_2. They could drop it somewhere, but maybe it's easier to drop it in room_3 first.

Action 15: gotoempty in room_3 → front of empty.

Action 16: drop red_box_2 room_3 → now not holding anything, red_box_2 is in room_3.

Now, go back to room_2:

Action 17: gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1 → front of grey_door_1.

Action 18: gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1 → back to room_1.

Action 19: gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2 → front of purple_door_1.

Action 20: gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1 → back to room_2.

Action 21: gotoobject grey_box_1 room_2 → front of grey_box_1.

Now, the goal is achieved: in front of a grey box (grey_box_1) in room_2.

But wait, the problem states that the final goal is "There is a box v such that the following conditions are all true: v is grey, you are in front of v". So the agent just needs to be in front of a grey box. So action 21 would be the last step.

But wait, the agent is currently in room_2, in front of grey_box_1. So this satisfies the goal.

But let's check all constraints again:

- Never in room_4: yes.

- At least one state with green_door_1 locked: initial state.

- If green_door_1 is locked (s0), then agent holds red_box_2 after s0: yes, picked up in action 8.

- At least one state with green_door_1 unlocked: action 14.

- If green_door_1 is unlocked (action 14), then earlier state holding red_box_2 (action 8): yes.

- At least one state in front of red_box_2: action 7 (when picked up).

- At least one state in room_3: initial and actions 12-16, etc.

- When in room_3 (initial), agent must hold something or red_door_1 unlocked in that state or after. After initial state, agent eventually holds red_box_2, which satisfies.

So the plan seems to meet all constraints. But let's check if the plan is optimal. Are there shorter paths?

Alternative approach: Maybe after unlocking purple_door_1, the agent can pick up red_box_2, then return to room_3 via room_1, toggle green_door_1, then go back to room_2 to reach grey_box_1. That's the path we have. Is there a shorter way?

Wait, perhaps after picking up red_box_2 in room_2, instead of returning to room_3, the agent can drop it somewhere in room_2 and proceed to grey_box_1. But the constraints require that after unlocking green_door_1 (which is in room_3), the agent must have held red_box_2 before. So they need to hold red_box_2 before toggling green_door_1. So they must carry it from room_2 to room_3 to toggle green_door_1. So that part is necessary.

But maybe after toggling green_door_1, they can drop red_box_2 in room_3 and then proceed to grey_box_1. Which is what the plan does. So steps 15-21 are necessary.

Alternatively, maybe they can drop red_box_2 earlier. But they need to be holding it when they toggle green_door_1? No, the constraint is that if green_door_1 is unlocked (in any state), there must be an earlier state where they held red_box_2. So as long as they held it before, it's okay. So they can drop it after picking it up, as long as before toggling green_door_1.

Wait, the agent picks up red_box_2 in action 8, then holds it until action 16 where they drop it. Then, when they toggle green_door_1 in action 14, they are holding it. Because action 14 is after action 8, so the earlier state (action 8) is when they picked it up. So even if they drop it before toggling green_door_1, as long as they held it before, the constraint is satisfied. Wait, no. The constraint says if green_door_1 is not locked in some state s, then there must be an earlier state where agent held red_box_2. So if s is the state after action 14 (green_door_1 unlocked), then any state before that where agent held red_box_2 is acceptable. So even if the agent drops it in room_2 after picking it up, then later toggles green_door_1, that's okay. So maybe there's a shorter path.

Wait, let's re-examine. Suppose:

After action 8 (pick red_box_2), the agent drops it immediately:

Action 9: drop red_box_2 room_2.

But then, when they go to toggle green_door_1, they are not holding it. But the constraint is that if green_door_1 is not locked (after toggling), there must be an earlier state where they held red_box_2. Which would be action 8. So that's acceptable. Then the agent could proceed to toggle green_door_1 without carrying red_box_2. But this would save steps of carrying it back to room_3.

But how to get to toggle green_door_1. The agent is in room_2. To get to green_door_1 in room_3, they need to go back to room_1 via purple_door_1, then to room_3 via grey_door_1.

But in this alternative path, after dropping red_box_2 in room_2, the agent can go back to room_3, toggle green_door_1, then go back to room_2 to get grey_box_1. But this would require more steps? Let's see:

Original plan has 21 steps. Alternative path would be:

After action 8 (pick red_box_2):

Action 9: drop red_box_2 room_2.

Then, go back to room_3:

Action 10: gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1.

Action 11: gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1.

Action 12: gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_3.

Action 13: gotoroom room_1 room_3 grey_door_1.

Action 14: gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4.

Action 15: toggle green_door_1.

Now, green_door_1 is unlocked. The agent held red_box_2 in action 8, which is before action 15. So the constraints are satisfied.

Then, go back to room_2 to get grey_box_1:

Action 16: gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1.

Action 17: gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1.

Action 18: gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2.

Action 19: gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1.

Action 20: gotoobject grey_box_1 room_2.

This way, the plan has 20 actions, which is shorter than the original 21. But is this valid?

Yes. Because dropping red_box_2 earlier saves steps of carrying it back. But wait, the constraint about being in front of red_box_2 at least once is satisfied in action 8 (gotoobject and pick). So dropping it doesn't affect that.

But in this alternative plan, after dropping red_box_2, when the agent goes back to room_3, they are not holding anything. So when they are in room_3 again (action 13), they are not holding anything, and red_door_1 is still locked. Does this violate the constraint? Because the constraint says if in room_3, then either red_door_1 is unlocked or holding something. In this case, during action 13, the agent is in room_3, not holding anything, and red_door_1 is still locked. So this violates the constraint unless they do something else.

Ah, right. So after dropping red_box_2, when the agent is back in room_3 (action 13), they are not holding anything. The red_door_1 is still locked. So in that state, the constraint requires that in that state or after, they must either unlock red_door_1 or hold something. But since they are not holding anything and red_door_1 is locked, they need to take action. So in this alternative path, after action 13, they have to either pick up an object in room_3 or unlock red_door_1. But red_door_1 is in room_2 and room_4, which the agent can't reach from room_3 unless they go through room_1 and room_2 again. But in this scenario, the agent is in room_3 after action 13 and needs to toggle green_door_1. So during action 13, they are in room_3, not holding anything. So to satisfy the constraint, after that, they must either hold something or unlock red_door_1. But the agent can't unlock red_door_1 from room_3. So they need to pick up an object in room_3.

But room_3 has blue_box_1 and purple_box_1. So the agent can pick one of them. But then they have to drop it later. Which adds steps.

Alternatively, when they return to room_3 after dropping red_box_2 in room_2, they need to pick up a box in room_3. Let's see:

After action 13 (back in room_3):

Action 14: gotoobject blue_box_1 room_3.

Action 15: pick blue_box_1 room_3.

Now, they are holding blue_box_1. Then proceed to toggle green_door_1.

Action 16: gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4.

Action 17: toggle green_door_1.

Now, green_door_1 is unlocked. Then drop the box:

Action 18: gotoempty room_3.

Action 19: drop blue_box_1 room_3.

Then go back to room_2 to get grey_box_1:

This adds several steps, making the plan longer than the original. So the original plan where the agent holds red_box_2 until returning to room_3 and toggling green_door_1, then drops it, avoids having to pick up another box. Because when in room_3 after returning (action 12), they are holding red_box_2, so the constraint is satisfied. Then after dropping it (action 16), when they go back to room_3 later (if needed), they would have to pick up something else. But in the original plan, after dropping red_box_2 (action 16), the agent goes back to room_2, which is allowed. But when returning to room_3 again (action 17-18), they are not holding anything, but they are in room_3. So they would need to satisfy the constraint again.

Wait, no. In the original plan, after action 16 (drop red_box_2 in room_3), the agent is in room_3, not holding anything. So during that state, the constraint applies: if in room_3, then either hold something or red_door_1 is unlocked. But red_door_1 is still locked. So the agent must take action to either pick up something or unlock red_door_1. But they can't unlock red_door_1 from room_3. So in the original plan, after dropping red_box_2 in room_3, the agent is in room_3, not holding anything, which violates the constraint unless they pick up something else. So this is a problem.

Ah, so the original plan has a flaw here. Because after dropping red_box_2 in room_3 (action 16), the agent is in room_3, not holding anything. So the constraint requires that in that state or after, they must hold something or have red_door_1 unlocked. Since red_door_1 is still locked, they need to pick up something. So the original plan misses this step.

So the alternative approach where the agent holds red_box_2 until after toggling green_door_1 is necessary. Let me recheck.

In the original plan:

After action 14 (toggle green_door_1), the agent is in room_3, holding red_box_2. Then they do action 15: gotoempty (room_3), action 16: drop red_box_2. Now, after action 16, they are in room_3, not holding anything. So at this point, the constraint applies: in room_3, must hold something or have red_door_1 unlocked. But red_door_1 is still locked. So the agent must pick up another object in room_3 (blue_box_1 or purple_box_1) or unlock red_door_1. But they can't unlock red_door_1 from room_3. So they need to pick up an object. Which adds steps.

Thus, the original plan is invalid because after dropping red_box_2, the agent is in room_3 without holding anything, violating the constraint.

So this means that the alternative approach where the agent holds red_box_2 until after toggling green_door_1 is necessary, and then must pick up another box in room_3 to satisfy the constraint. Alternatively, find another way.

Wait, perhaps after dropping red_box_2 in room_3, the agent can immediately pick it up again. But that seems inefficient. Alternatively, after toggling green_door_1, the agent can drop red_box_2 and then pick up another box.

Let me adjust the original plan to address this.

Revised plan steps:

1. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1

2. toggle grey_door_1

3. gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1

4. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2

5. toggle purple_door_1

6. gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1

7. gotoobject red_box_2 room_2

8. pick red_box_2 room_2

9. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1

10. gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1

11. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_3

12. gotoroom room_1 room_3 grey_door_1

13. gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4

14. toggle green_door_1

15. gotoempty room_3

16. drop red_box_2 room_3

17. gotoobject blue_box_1 room_3

18. pick blue_box_1 room_3

19. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1

20. gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1

21. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2

22. gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1

23. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_2

This adds steps 17-18 to pick up blue_box_1 after dropping red_box_2. Now, after step 18, the agent is holding blue_box_1 in room_3, which satisfies the constraint when they are in room_3. Then they can proceed to go to room_2 to reach grey_box_1.

But this makes the plan longer. Is there a better way?

Alternatively, after toggling green_door_1 (action 14), instead of dropping red_box_2, the agent can keep holding it and proceed directly to room_2. Because being in room_3 while holding red_box_2 satisfies the constraint. So:

After action 14 (toggle green_door_1), agent is in room_3, holding red_box_2. Then go to room_1 and room_2 while still holding it.

Action 15: gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1

Action 16: gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1

Action 17: gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2

Action 18: gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1

Action 19: gotoobject grey_box_1 room_2

Now, the agent is in front of grey_box_1 in room_2, still holding red_box_2. Then they can drop red_box_2 if needed, but the goal is just to be in front of a grey box, so action 19 suffices. The agent doesn't need to drop red_box_2.

But wait, the goal is to have the agent in front of a grey box. So as long as they are in front of grey_box_1, it doesn't matter what they are holding. So this plan would have 19 actions, which is shorter.

But let's check the constraints again. When the agent is in room_3 after action 14, they are holding red_box_2, which satisfies the constraint. Then they leave room_3, so the constraint is not relevant again until they return. But they don't return to room_3 again in this plan. So this plan would work.

So the revised steps:

1. goto grey_door_1 in room_3.

2. toggle.

3. go to room_1.

4. goto purple_door_1 in room_1.

5. toggle.

6. go to room_2.

7. goto red_box_2.

8. pick.

9. go to purple_door_1 in room_2.

10. go to room_1.

11. go to grey_door_1 in room_1.

12. go to room_3.

13. go to green_door_1 in room_3.

14. toggle.

15. go to grey_door_1 in room_3.

16. go to room_1.

17. go to purple_door_1 in room_1.

18. go to room_2.

19. go to grey_box_1.

This plan has 19 actions. Let's check the constraints:

- Never in room_4: yes.

- Green_door_1 locked in initial state: yes.

- After picking red_box_2, the agent holds it, satisfying the conditional.

- Green_door_1 unlocked in action 14.

- Before action 14, the agent held red_box_2 (action 8).

- In front of red_box_2 during action 7 and when picked.

- In room_3 during initial, actions 12-14.

- When in room_3 (action 12-14), the agent is holding red_box_2, satisfying the constraint.

Thus, this plan seems valid and shorter. But when the agent is in room_3 after action 14, they are holding red_box_2, which satisfies the constraint. Then, when they leave room_3, the constraint doesn't apply anymore.

So the optimal plan would be this 19-step plan.

But let's count the steps again to make sure:

1. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1

2. toggle grey_door_1

3. gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1

4. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2

5. toggle purple_door_1

6. gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1

7. gotoobject red_box_2 room_2

8. pick red_box_2 room_2

9. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_2 room_1

10. gotoroom room_2 room_1 purple_door_1

11. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_1 room_3

12. gotoroom room_1 room_3 grey_door_1

13. gotodoor green_door_1 room_3 room_4

14. toggle green_door_1

15. gotodoor grey_door_1 room_3 room_1

16. gotoroom room_3 room_1 grey_door_1

17. gotodoor purple_door_1 room_1 room_2

18. gotoroom room_1 room_2 purple_door_1

19. gotoobject grey_box_1 room_2

Yes, 19 actions. This should be valid and optimal.
