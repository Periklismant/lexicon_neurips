Okay, let's tackle this planning problem step by step. The goal is to get stone1 to a goal location, which in this case is pos55. But there are several constraints to consider. Let me first understand the initial state and the constraints.

Starting with the initial state: The agent (player1) is at pos41. Stone1 is at pos33. The only goal location is pos55. All other locations are non-goal. The constraints are a bit tricky:

1. At some point, pos55 must not be clear (so stone1 must end up there, which is the goal, but also maybe the agent is there? But since the goal is to have the stone there, that's probably the main way to satisfy this. But the constraint is that pos55 is not clear in at least one state, which will happen when stone1 is placed there.

2. If pos55 is not clear in a state, there must be an earlier state where either player1 is at pos22 or pos43 is not clear. So before moving the stone to pos55, the agent needs to have been at pos22 or pos43 had something (like the stone) blocking it. But initially, pos43 is clear. So maybe the agent has to go to pos22 at some point before moving the stone to pos55.

3. At least one state must have pos45 not clear. So either the agent or stone1 is there. But since pos45 is a non-goal location, if we push the stone there, we have to move it again, which might complicate things. But maybe we can have the agent pass through pos45.

4. If pos45 is not clear in a state s, then either player1 is at pos22 in s or later, or pos53 is not clear in s or later. So after pos45 is occupied, we need to ensure that either the agent is at pos22 eventually or pos53 gets blocked.

5. Every state must have pos25 clear. So we can never have the agent or a stone in pos25. So all actions must avoid pos25.

The main goal is to move stone1 from pos33 to pos55. Let's think about the path. pos33 is at row3, column3. pos55 is at row5, column5. The agent starts at pos41 (row4, column1). So the agent needs to navigate to pos33, then push the stone towards pos55.

But the constraints complicate things. Let's outline the steps:

1. Agent moves from pos41 to pos33 to push the stone. But how?

The movement grid allows certain directions. From pos41, the agent can go to pos31 (dirleft) or pos51 (dirright) or pos42 (dirdown). Let's check the possible paths.

Wait, the movement connections:

From pos41, possible moves:
- dirleft to pos31
- dirright to pos51
- dirdown to pos42

So to get to pos33, which is the stone's initial location, the agent needs to reach pos43 (since pushing requires the agent to be adjacent in the direction of the push. Wait, the push actions require that the agent is at l_p, which is adjacent to l_from (the stone's location) in direction d. Then, the stone is pushed from l_from to l_to, which is in the same direction d.

So for example, to push the stone from pos33 to pos34 (dirdown), the agent needs to be at pos33's direction up, which is pos23, or direction left (pos32?), wait no. Wait, the directions are dirup, dirdown, dirleft, dirright. So the direction from the agent's position to the stone's position.

So for pushtogoal or pushtonongoal, the agent must be at l_p, which is adjacent to l_from (stone's location) in direction d. Then, the stone moves from l_from to l_to in the same direction d. So, for example, if the agent is north (dirup direction) of the stone, pushing it south (dirdown) would move the stone south, and the agent ends up at the stone's original position.

So for the stone at pos33, the agent needs to be in a position adjacent to pos33. The possible adjacent locations are pos23 (up), pos43 (down), pos32 (left), pos34 (right). Let's check which of these the agent can reach.

Agent starts at pos41. Let's plan a path from pos41 to pos43, which is below pos33. Because if the agent is at pos43 (south of pos33), they can push the stone north (dirup) to pos23, but that's not helpful. Wait, no. Wait, if the agent is at pos43 (south of pos33), and direction d is dirup (since pos33 is north of pos43), then pushing the stone would move it north from pos33. But pos33 is at (3,3), so north would be pos23. But pos23 is not a goal. Alternatively, pushing the stone east (dirright) from pos33 would require the agent to be west (pos32) of the stone, then pushing east to pos34. But pos34 is not a goal. Alternatively, pushing the stone south (dirdown) to pos43, but pos43 is a non-goal. The goal is pos55, so the stone needs to go to pos55.

So the stone's path needs to go from pos33 to pos34, then pos44, pos54, pos55. Or another path. Alternatively, pos33 to pos43, then pos53, then pos54, pos55. Let's see which path is possible considering the movement connections.

First, the agent needs to reach a position adjacent to the stone. Let's consider moving the agent to pos43. From pos41, the agent can move down to pos42, then down to pos43. So:

move player1 pos41 pos42 dirdown
move player1 pos42 pos43 dirdown

Once at pos43, the agent can push the stone to pos34 (dirup from pos43 to pos33, then pushing north to pos23? Wait, no. Wait, if the agent is at pos43, which is south of pos33. To push the stone, the agent's direction d must be from l_p (pos43) to l_from (pos33), which is dirup. Then the stone is pushed in direction d (dirup) from pos33 to pos23. But pos23 is a non-goal. Alternatively, if the agent is at pos32 (west of pos33), direction dirright, pushing the stone east to pos34. But how to get to pos32?

Alternatively, the agent could go to pos34 (east of pos33), but pos34 is adjacent to pos33's east. So agent at pos34, pushing west to pos33. Wait, no. The direction would be dirleft from pos34 to pos33, then pushing the stone west to pos32. Not helpful.

Hmm, perhaps the optimal path is to push the stone south to pos43, then east to pos53, then south to pos54, then east to pos55. Let's check if that's possible.

So, first, agent needs to get to pos43. Then, push the stone from pos33 to pos43 (dirdown direction). Wait, but pushing from pos33 to pos43 would require the agent to be at pos33's north (pos23) or south (pos43). If agent is at pos43, direction is dirup to pos33. Then pushing in dirup direction would move the stone from pos33 to pos23 (north). But that's moving away from the goal. Alternatively, if the agent is at pos34 (east of pos33), direction dirleft to pos33, and then pushing the stone west to pos32. Not helpful.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's clarify the push directions. For example, if the agent is at pos43 (south of pos33), then to push the stone north (dirup), from pos33 to pos23. But that's moving the stone away from the goal. Alternatively, pushing the stone east (dirright) from pos33 to pos34. For that, the agent would need to be west of pos33 (pos32), then push east. So agent at pos32, direction dirright to pos33, then pushing the stone to pos34.

So the agent's path would be pos41 -> pos42 -> pos32 (how?). Let's see: pos41 can move down to pos42. From pos42, possible moves: left (dirleft) to pos32, right (dirright) to pos52, up to pos41, or down to pos43. So from pos42, moving left to pos32. Then from pos32, can move right (dirright) to pos42, up (dirup) to pos31, down (dirdown) to pos33 (but pos33 has the stone, so it's not clear. Wait, pos33 is clear? Wait in the initial state, "Location pos33 is clear" is stated. Wait, no: the initial state says "stone1 is at location pos33" and "Location pos33 is clear". Wait, that's a contradiction. Wait no: "clear" in the context of the problem probably means that the location is not occupied by the agent or another stone. Since the stone is at pos33, but the agent is not, perhaps the "clear" refers to the agent being able to move there. Wait, but according to the problem description: "Each position on the grid may contain either the agent, a stone or be empty." So a location is clear if it has neither the agent nor a stone. But in the initial state, "stone1 is at location pos33", so pos33 is not clear. However, the initial state says "Location pos33 is clear". That must be a mistake. Wait, let me check the original state again.

Looking back at the original state:

The original state includes:

"stone1 is at location pos33"

"Location pos33 is clear"

Wait, that's conflicting. If a stone is at pos33, then pos33 is not clear. But according to the problem statement, the preconditions for move actions require that the destination is clear. So perhaps in this problem, "clear" means that the agent is not there, but stones can be present. Or maybe "clear" means no stones or agents. This is a critical point.

Looking at the action definitions:

For the "move" action, precondition (ii) states "location l_to is clear". If a location has a stone, is it considered not clear? Because the agent can't move into a location with a stone. So "clear" must mean that the location has neither the agent nor a stone. So if a stone is present, the location is not clear.

But in the initial state, it says "Location pos33 is clear" even though stone1 is there. That's a contradiction. This must be an error in the problem statement. Alternatively, perhaps "clear" refers to the agent not being present, and stones don't block movement. But that doesn't make sense because the agent can't share a location with a stone. Let me check the problem statement again.

The problem says: "Each position on the grid may contain either the agent, a stone or be empty." So each position can have at most one entity. Therefore, if a stone is at pos33, then pos33 is not clear. But according to the original state, pos33 is clear. That's a problem. This must be a mistake in the problem description. Alternatively, maybe "clear" refers to the agent not being there, but stones are allowed. Wait, but the move action requires that the destination is clear. So if the destination has a stone, the agent can't move there. So in the initial state, pos33 is clear (no agent), but there's a stone there. That can't be. Therefore, there's an error in the problem's initial state. But given that the user provided the problem, we have to work with what's given. Maybe "Location pos33 is clear" in the initial state is a mistake, and the actual state has the stone at pos33, making pos33 not clear. But according to the given initial state:

The original state includes:

"player1 is at location pos41"

"stone1 is at location pos33"

"Location pos33 is clear"

This is conflicting. So perhaps in this problem, "clear" refers only to the agent's presence, and stones don't affect it. That would make the move action's precondition (ii) that the location is clear (no agent), but stones are allowed. But that's not how typical grid problems work. Alternatively, maybe the initial state has an error, and pos33 is actually clear (no stone), but that contradicts the stone's location. This is a problem. But since the problem states that stone1 is at pos33, and pos33 is clear, this must be an inconsistency. However, I have to proceed with the given information.

Assuming that "clear" in the problem refers to the absence of both the agent and stones, then the initial state's assertion that pos33 is clear while stone1 is there is incorrect. But since the user provided this, perhaps there's a misunderstanding. Alternatively, maybe "clear" means that the agent is not present, regardless of stones. In that case, the agent can move to a location with a stone, which doesn't make sense. So this is a problem.

But given that the problem states "stone1 is at location pos33" and "Location pos33 is clear", I have to proceed under the assumption that in this context, "clear" means that the agent is not present, and stones are allowed. So when moving, the agent can move to a location with a stone? That can't be, because the move action's precondition requires that the destination is clear. So perhaps the initial state is incorrectly stating that pos33 is clear when there's a stone there. This is a problem. But perhaps it's a typo, and the stone is at pos33, making pos33 not clear. But the initial state lists "Location pos33 is clear". This is confusing.

Alternatively, maybe the problem uses "clear" to mean that the agent is not present, and stones are separate. So a location can have a stone and still be considered clear for the agent's movement. But that would mean the agent can move into a location with a stone, which contradicts typical movement rules. This is very confusing. But given the problem's initial state, we have to work with the information as given. So according to the initial state, pos33 has stone1 and is clear. That suggests that "clear" refers to the agent's absence, and stones don't affect clearance. Therefore, the agent can move into a location with a stone. But that seems odd. However, the move action's preconditions state that the destination must be clear. So if pos33 is clear (agent not there), even with a stone, the agent can move there. But that would mean the agent can share a location with a stone, which contradicts the problem's statement that each position may contain either the agent, a stone, or be empty. Therefore, this must be an error in the problem's initial state. But since we have to work with what's given, perhaps we should proceed under the assumption that "clear" means the agent is not there, regardless of stones. So the agent can move to a location with a stone if it's clear (agent not there). But that's not possible because the stone is already there. This is a critical issue.

Alternatively, maybe the problem's initial state has a typo, and "Location pos33 is clear" should not be there. Let's check the original state again.

Looking back:

The original state includes:

"Location pos33 is clear"

But also:

"stone1 is at location pos33"

This is a contradiction. Therefore, there's a mistake. But since this is a planning problem, perhaps the correct initial state is that pos33 is not clear (since it has the stone), but the problem statement erroneously lists it as clear. Therefore, perhaps the user made a mistake. But since we have to follow the problem as given, perhaps the stone is at pos33, and pos33 is not clear. So the initial state's "Location pos33 is clear" is incorrect. But how can we proceed?

Alternatively, perhaps the problem defines "clear" as not having the agent, regardless of stones. So even if a stone is present, the location is clear as long as the agent isn't there. In that case, the agent can move to a location with a stone. But that's conflicting with the problem's description that each position can contain either the agent, a stone, or be empty. So the agent can't be in the same position as a stone. Therefore, the move action's precondition (ii) must require that the destination has no agent or stone. So if a location has a stone, it's not clear, and the agent can't move there. Therefore, in the initial state, pos33 is not clear (since there's a stone there), but the problem says it's clear. This is a problem. 

This inconsistency makes it difficult to proceed. But given the problem as stated, perhaps we should assume that the initial state is correct, and "clear" refers only to the agent's absence. Therefore, even if a stone is present, the location is considered clear. So the agent can move into a location with a stone. That would allow the agent to move to pos33, which has the stone. But according to the problem's description, each position can have either the agent, a stone, or be empty. Therefore, this is impossible. Hence, there's a contradiction in the problem's initial state. 

Given this confusion, perhaps the best approach is to proceed under the assumption that the initial state has a typo, and pos33 is not clear (since the stone is there). Therefore, the agent cannot move into pos33. So the agent must navigate around to positions adjacent to pos33 to push the stone.

But the problem says that pos33 is clear, so perhaps the stone is not there, but that contradicts the "stone1 is at pos33". This is very confusing. Maybe the problem intended that pos33 is clear (no agent) but has a stone, making it not clear for movement. But the problem's initial state says pos33 is clear. Therefore, in this problem, a location with a stone is considered clear. That must be the case. Therefore, the agent can move into a location with a stone. But that's not possible according to the problem's description. This is a contradiction. 

This is a major issue. However, given that the problem states that the initial location pos33 is clear and has the stone, perhaps "clear" here means that the agent can move there regardless of the stone. Therefore, the move action's precondition (ii) only checks for the agent's presence, not the stone's. That would allow the agent to move into a location with a stone, but according to the problem's description, each position can have either the agent, a stone, or be empty. Therefore, this is impossible. 

This is a critical problem. Without resolving this, it's hard to proceed. Perhaps the user made a mistake in the initial state, but we have to proceed with the given information. 

Assuming that "clear" means the agent is not present, and stones don't affect clearance, then the agent can move to pos33 even though the stone is there. But according to the problem's description, that's impossible. Therefore, this is a contradiction, and perhaps the correct initial state is that pos33 is not clear. So even though the problem says pos33 is clear, it's a mistake, and the stone's presence makes it not clear. Therefore, the agent cannot move to pos33. 

Under this assumption, the agent must navigate to a position adjacent to pos33 to push the stone. Let's proceed with that.

The stone is at pos33. The agent starts at pos41. To push the stone, the agent needs to be adjacent to pos33. The possible adjacent positions are pos23 (north), pos43 (south), pos32 (west), pos34 (east).

Let's plan the path for the agent to reach pos43 (south of pos33). From pos41, the agent can move down to pos42, then down to pos43. So:

1. move player1 pos41 pos42 dirdown
2. move player1 pos42 pos43 dirdown

Now, the agent is at pos43, which is south of pos33. Now, the agent can push the stone north (dirup) to pos23. But pos23 is not a goal. However, maybe that's part of the path. But we need to get the stone to pos55.

Alternatively, the agent could push the stone east from pos33 to pos34. To do that, the agent needs to be west of pos33 (pos32). So the agent would have to go from pos41 to pos42 to pos32. Let's see if that's possible.

From pos41, move to pos42 (dirdown). From pos42, move left (dirleft) to pos32. So:

1. move player1 pos41 pos42 dirdown
2. move player1 pos42 pos32 dirleft

Now, the agent is at pos32, which is west of pos33. Then, the agent can push the stone east (dirright) to pos34. But pos34 is not a goal. Then, from there, push further east to pos44, etc.

But pos55 is the only goal. So the stone needs to reach pos55. So perhaps the path is pos33 → pos34 → pos44 → pos54 → pos55. Let's check if this path is possible.

First, push from pos33 to pos34. To do this, the agent must be west of pos33 (pos32). Then, push east. So:

Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos33 pos34 dirright

This moves the stone to pos34. Now, the agent is at pos33.

Next, the agent needs to push the stone east to pos44. For that, the agent must be at pos34's west (pos33) and push east. But after the first push, the agent is at pos33. From there, they can move east to pos34 (but pos34 has the stone now). Wait, no: after pushing, the stone is at pos34, which is now not clear. So the agent can't move into pos34. Therefore, after the first push, the agent is at pos33. To push the stone from pos34 to pos44, the agent needs to be west of pos34 (pos24 or pos33), but pos33 is adjacent to pos34's west. So the agent is already at pos33. So the next push would be from pos34 to pos44, requiring the agent to be at pos34's west (pos33) and direction dirright. So:

pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos34 pos44 dirright

But wait, after the first push, the agent is at pos33 (since after a push action, the agent moves to l_from (pos33) from l_p (pos32). Wait, no. Let's look at the effect of the pushtonongoal action:

After performing pushtonongoal, the agent is no longer at l_p (pos32), and moves to l_from (pos33). So after the first push, the agent is at pos33. Then, the stone is at pos34.

Now, to push the stone from pos34 to pos44, the agent needs to be at pos34's west (pos33) and push east (dirright). So:

pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos34 pos44 dirright

This would move the stone to pos44. Now, the agent is at pos34.

Next, push the stone from pos44 to pos54. The agent needs to be west of pos44 (pos34) and push east. So:

pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos44 pos54 dirright

Then, the stone is at pos54. Finally, push to pos55. But pos54 to pos55 requires a dirdown direction (since pos55 is south of pos54? Wait, according to the movement connections:

Looking at the movement from pos54 to pos55: "You may move from location pos54 to location pos55 following direction dirdown". So pos55 is south of pos54. Therefore, to push the stone from pos54 to pos55 (south), the agent needs to be north of pos54 (pos44) and push south. But the stone is at pos54. So the agent must be at pos54's north (pos44) and push south (dirdown). So:

pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos54 pos55 dirdown

But wait, the agent is at pos44 after the previous push. So to push the stone from pos54 to pos55, the agent needs to be at pos54's north (pos44), move to pos54, but pos54 has the stone. Alternatively, perhaps the agent is at pos54's west (pos53), and pushes east (dirright) to pos55. Let me check the movement connections.

Looking at pos54's possible moves: can move left to pos44, up to pos53 (dirup?), wait no. Let me check the movement connections given:

The movement connections include:

"You may move from location pos54 to location pos44 following direction dirleft"

"You may move from location pos54 to location pos53 following direction dirup"

"You may move from location pos54 to location pos55 following direction dirdown"

So pos54's neighbors are pos44 (west), pos53 (north), pos55 (south). Therefore, to push the stone from pos54 to pos55 (south), the agent must be north of pos54 (pos53) and push south (dirdown). Alternatively, west (pos44) and push east (dirright) would require pos54's east, which is pos55. Wait, no. pos54's east would be pos55 if the grid is 5x5, but the directions are a bit unclear. Let me clarify the grid layout.

Assuming the positions are labeled posXY where X is the row and Y is the column. So pos11 is row 1, column 1. pos55 is row5, column5.

Then, moving down from pos54 (row5, column4) would go to pos55 (row5, column5)? No, moving down would increase the row number. Wait, but row5 is the last row. So perhaps the directions are different. Maybe directions are defined as:

- dirup: decreases row number (north)

- dirdown: increases row number (south)

- dirleft: decreases column number (west)

- dirright: increases column number (east)

So, for example, pos54 (row5, column4) moving dirdown would be row6, which doesn't exist, so invalid. But according to the movement connections given, pos54 can move dirdown to pos55. So pos54 (row5, column4) moving dirdown (south) to pos55 (row5, column5) must mean that the direction is east. Wait, this is confusing. Maybe the directions are different. Alternatively, the grid might be arranged such that moving right increases the column, moving down increases the row.

So pos11 is top-left, pos15 is top-right, pos51 is bottom-left, pos55 is bottom-right.

In that case, moving from pos54 (row5, column4) to pos55 (row5, column5) would be dirright (east). But according to the movement connections given, "You may move from location pos54 to location pos55 following direction dirdown". So perhaps the directions are different. For example, moving down from pos54 leads to pos55, which would mean that pos55 is south of pos54. That would require that pos54 is row4, column5, and pos55 is row5, column5. But according to the location names, pos54 is row5, column4. So this is conflicting. 

This indicates that the movement directions might not follow standard grid directions. Therefore, the only way to determine valid moves is to rely on the given movement connections.

Given that pos54 can move to pos55 via dirdown, but pos54 is row5, column4, and pos55 is row5, column5. So moving down from pos54 to pos55 would imply that down is east, which is non-standard. Alternatively, the movement directions are mislabeled. This complicates pathfinding.

Given the movement connections provided, we have to rely on the explicit moves. For example:

From pos54, you can move to pos44 (dirleft), pos53 (dirup), or pos55 (dirdown). So pos55 is south of pos54. Therefore, to push the stone from pos54 to pos55 (south), the agent must be north of pos54, which is pos53. Because the agent needs to be adjacent to the stone's current location (pos54) in direction d (dirdown). Wait, no. For the push action, the agent must be at l_p, which is adjacent to l_from (stone's location) in direction d. Then, the stone is pushed from l_from to l_to in direction d. So if the stone is at pos54, and the agent is at pos53 (north of pos54), then direction d is dirdown (from pos53 to pos54). Then, pushing the stone dirdown from pos54 to pos55.

So the action would be pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos53 pos54 pos55 dirdown.

But to do that, the agent needs to be at pos53. So after pushing the stone to pos54, the agent is at pos44 (from the previous push). So how to get to pos53?

Wait, after pushing the stone from pos44 to pos54, the agent is at pos44. Then, the agent needs to move to pos53 to push the stone to pos55. Let's see:

From pos44, movement options are:

- dirleft to pos34

- dirright to pos54

- dirup to pos43

- dirdown to pos45 (but pos45 is clear initially, but after pushing, maybe not)

Wait, according to the movement connections:

"You may move from location pos44 to location pos34 following direction dirleft"

"You may move from location pos44 to location pos54 following direction dirright"

"You may move from location pos44 to location pos43 following direction dirup"

"You may move from location pos44 to location pos45 following direction dirdown"

So from pos44, the agent can move to pos54 (dirright), but pos54 has the stone after the previous push, so it's not clear. Therefore, the agent can't move there. So the agent needs to find another path to pos53.

Alternative path: from pos44, move up to pos43, then right to pos53.

From pos44, move dirup to pos43. Then from pos43, move dirdown to pos53 (but according to movement connections, pos43 can move to pos53 via dirright? Let me check.

Looking at the movement connections:

"You may move from location pos43 to location pos33 following direction dirleft"

"You may move from location pos43 to location pos53 following direction dirright"

"You may move from location pos43 to location pos42 following direction dirup"

"You may move from location pos43 to location pos44 following direction dirdown"

So from pos43, dirright to pos53. So the agent can go from pos44 to pos43 (dirup), then to pos53 (dirright).

So steps after pushing to pos54:

3. move player1 pos44 pos43 dirup

4. move player1 pos43 pos53 dirright

Now, the agent is at pos53. Then, push the stone from pos54 to pos55:

5. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos53 pos54 pos55 dirdown

This would satisfy the goal of having the stone at pos55.

Now, let's check the constraints:

- Constraint 1: pos55 must not be clear in at least one state. This is satisfied when the stone is pushed there.

- Constraint 2: Before pos55 is not clear (i.e., before the stone is pushed there), there must be an earlier state where player1 is at pos22 or pos43 is not clear. In our current plan, the agent moves through pos43 (steps 3 and 4), so pos43 is occupied by the agent during step 3 (move from pos44 to pos43). So when the agent is at pos43, pos43 is not clear. Therefore, before step 5 (when pos55 becomes not clear), there's a state where pos43 is not clear (when the agent is there). This satisfies constraint 2.

- Constraint 3: pos45 must not be clear in at least one state. In our current plan, pos45 is not visited. So we need to include an action that makes pos45 not clear. How? The agent could move there, but pos45 is a non-goal location. However, the constraint requires that pos45 is not clear in at least one state. So the agent must either move to pos45 or push the stone there. But pushing the stone there would require moving it away from the goal path, which complicates things. So perhaps we need to adjust the plan to include a step where the agent is at pos45 or the stone is there.

But in our current plan, the stone goes from pos33 → pos34 → pos44 → pos54 → pos55. The agent's path is pos41 → pos42 → pos32 → pos33 → pos34 → pos44 → pos43 → pos53 → pos54 (no, the agent pushes to pos54 and moves to pos44, then to pos43, then to pos53). The agent doesn't go to pos45. Therefore, we need to include a step where pos45 is not clear. How can we do this without violating other constraints?

Option 1: Have the agent move to pos45 at some point. Since pos45 is a non-goal location, but the constraint just requires that it's not clear in at least one state. So the agent can move there and then move away. However, every state must have pos25 clear. So pos25 must remain clear, so the agent can't go there. Also, the agent's movement to pos45 must not interfere with other steps.

Looking at the movement connections, from pos44, the agent can move dirdown to pos45. So after step 2 (pushing the stone to pos34), the agent is at pos33. Then, perhaps after pushing to pos34, the agent moves to pos34 (can't because it's occupied by the stone). Wait, after pushing to pos34, the agent is at pos33. Then, the agent can move east to pos34 if it's clear. But pos34 has the stone, so it's not clear. Therefore, the agent can't move there. So alternative path: after pushing to pos34, the agent is at pos33. From there, the agent can move to pos34 (no, blocked), pos43 (south), pos32 (west), or pos23 (north). Let's see.

From pos33, movement options:

Looking at the connections, pos33 can move to pos23 (dirleft), pos43 (dirdown), pos32 (dirup?), wait no. According to the given connections:

"You may move from location pos33 to location pos23 following direction dirleft"

"You may move from location pos33 to location pos43 following direction dirright"

Wait, that's confusing. Wait, the movement from pos33 to pos43 is dirright? If pos33 is (3,3), then dirright would be east to (3,4) pos34. But according to the given connections:

"You may move from location pos33 to location pos23 following direction dirleft"

"You may move from location pos33 to location pos43 following direction dirright"

"You may move from location pos33 to location pos32 following direction dirup"

"You may move from location pos33 to location pos34 following direction dirdown"

Wait, this suggests that directions are not aligned with standard grid directions. For example, from pos33, dirleft leads to pos23 (north?), dirright to pos43 (south?), dirup to pos32 (west?), dirdown to pos34 (east?). This is very non-intuitive. Therefore, the directions are not standard, and we have to rely strictly on the given connections.

Given that, from pos33, the agent can move:

- dirleft to pos23

- dirright to pos43

- dirup to pos32

- dirdown to pos34

So after pushing the stone to pos34, the agent is at pos33. To reach pos45, the agent would have to go from pos33 to pos34 (dirdown), but pos34 has the stone, so it's not clear. Therefore, the agent can't move there. Alternatively, the agent can move from pos33 to pos43 (dirright), then to pos44 (dirdown), then to pos45 (dirdown). Let's see:

From pos33, move dirright to pos43.

Then from pos43, move dirdown to pos44.

From pos44, move dirdown to pos45.

So steps after pushing to pos34:

3. move player1 pos33 pos43 dirright

4. move player1 pos43 pos44 dirdown

5. move player1 pos44 pos45 dirdown

Now, pos45 is not clear (agent is there). Then, the agent needs to get back to pushing the stone. But this adds steps and may violate the constraint that after pos45 is not clear, either player1 is at pos22 or pos53 is not clear. 

But according to constraint 4: If pos45 is not clear in state s, then in s or a later state, player1 is at pos22 or pos53 is not clear. So after the agent is at pos45 (state s), in some later state, either player1 is at pos22 or pos53 is not clear. 

But in our current plan, after step 5, the agent is at pos45. Then, to continue pushing the stone, the agent would need to move back to pos44, then to pos43, then to pos53. But this may take too many steps. Also, pos53 is part of the path to push the stone to pos55. So when the agent moves to pos53, pos53 is not clear, satisfying constraint 4.

But this approach adds several steps, making the plan longer. However, the problem requires an optimal plan (shortest possible). So we need to find a way to satisfy all constraints with minimal steps.

Alternative idea: During the stone's path, after pushing it to pos44, perhaps the agent can move to pos45 and then continue. Let's see:

Original plan steps (without considering constraint 3):

1. move player1 pos41 pos42 dirdown

2. move player1 pos42 pos32 dirleft

3. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos33 pos34 dirright

4. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos34 pos44 dirright

5. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos44 pos54 dirright

6. move player1 pos34 pos43 dirup

7. move player1 pos43 pos53 dirright

8. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos53 pos54 pos55 dirdown

This is 8 steps. But constraint 3 requires that pos45 is not clear in at least one state. So we need to insert a step where pos45 is occupied. The agent can move to pos45 after step 4 (when the stone is at pos44 and the agent is at pos34). From pos34, the agent can move to pos44 (dirright?), wait movement from pos34:

Movement connections from pos34:

"You may move from location pos34 to location pos24 following direction dirleft"

"You may move from location pos34 to location pos44 following direction dirright"

"You may move from location pos34 to location pos33 following direction dirup"

"You may move from location pos34 to location pos35 following direction dirdown"

So from pos34, the agent can move to pos44 (dirright). But pos44 has the stone after step 4. So after step 4, the stone is at pos44, so the agent can't move there. Therefore, after step 4, the agent is at pos34. From there, the agent can move to pos44 only if it's clear, which it's not (stone is there). So alternative path: after step 4 (agent at pos34), move to pos35 (dirdown). Then from pos35, move to pos45 (dirright). Let's check:

After step 4, agent is at pos34. Move to pos35 (dirdown):

5. move player1 pos34 pos35 dirdown

Then, from pos35, move to pos45 (dirright):

6. move player1 pos35 pos45 dirright

Now, pos45 is not clear (agent is there). Then, the agent needs to get back to pushing the stone. From pos45, the agent can move to pos35 (dirleft), then to pos34 (dirup), then to pos44 (dirright). But pos44 has the stone. So this would take several steps. Then, proceed to push the stone to pos54 and pos55.

But this adds steps 5 and 6, making the plan longer. However, we need to satisfy constraint 3. So the question is, can we find a way to satisfy constraint 3 without adding too many steps?

Another approach: After step 3 (stone at pos34), the agent is at pos33. The agent can move to pos43 (dirright), then to pos44 (dirdown), then to pos45 (dirdown). This would make pos45 not clear. Then, the agent can move back to pos44 (dirup), pos43 (dirup), then to pos53 (dirright), etc. But this adds steps.

Alternatively, perhaps during the initial movement, the agent can take a detour to pos45. For example, after step 1 (pos42), instead of moving to pos32, go to pos43, then to pos44, then to pos45. But that would delay pushing the stone.

This is getting complicated. Let's think of all constraints again:

Constraints:

1. pos55 not clear in at least one state (achieved by final step).

2. Before pos55 not clear, either player1 at pos22 or pos43 not clear. In current plan, pos43 is not clear when agent moves there (step 6).

3. pos45 not clear in at least one state. Need to add this.

4. If pos45 is not clear in state s, then in s or later, player1 at pos22 or pos53 not clear. So if we make pos45 not clear by having the agent there, then later, pos53 is not clear (when agent moves there).

So if we add a step where the agent is at pos45, then later, when the agent moves to pos53, pos53 is not clear, which satisfies the condition.

So steps:

After the stone is at pos44 (step4), the agent is at pos34. The agent can move to pos35 (dirdown), then to pos45 (dirright), then back to pos35 (dirleft), pos34 (dirup), then proceed to push the stone.

But this adds several steps. Alternatively, after step4, the agent is at pos34. From there, move to pos44 (dirright) is blocked. So move to pos35 (dirdown), then to pos45 (dirright). So:

5. move player1 pos34 pos35 dirdown

6. move player1 pos35 pos45 dirright

Now, pos45 is not clear (satisfies constraint3). Then, the agent needs to get back to pos34 to push the stone. So:

7. move player1 pos45 pos35 dirleft

8. move player1 pos35 pos34 dirup

Then proceed to push the stone from pos44 to pos54 (step5 becomes step9):

9. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos44 pos54 dirright

Then move to pos43, pos53, and push to pos55.

But this adds steps 5-8, making the plan longer. However, the problem requires an optimal plan, so we need to find the shortest possible way.

Alternative idea: Use a different path for the stone that passes through pos45. For example, push the stone to pos34, then pos44, then pos45, then pos55. But pos45 is not a goal location, so the stone can't stay there. We need to push it further to pos55. But pos45 to pos55 requires moving east (dirright) to pos55. Let's check if that's possible.

From pos45, can the agent push the stone east to pos55? The movement from pos45 to pos55 is dirright. So if the stone is at pos45, the agent can be west (pos44) and push east. But pos55 is a goal location, so we can use pushtogoal.

So alternative plan:

1. move to pos32

2. push stone to pos34

3. push to pos44

4. push to pos45

5. push to pos55

But pos45 is a non-goal, so step4 must be pushtonongoal. Then step5 is pushtogoal.

So steps:

1. move player1 pos41 pos42 dirdown

2. move player1 pos42 pos32 dirleft

3. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos33 pos34 dirright

4. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos34 pos44 dirright

5. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos44 pos45 dirright

6. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos45 pos55 dirright

This way, the stone's path is pos33 → pos34 → pos44 → pos45 → pos55. This satisfies the goal.

Now, check the constraints:

- Constraint3: pos45 is not clear when the stone is there (step5). Satisfied.

- Constraint4: When pos45 is not clear (step5), in that state or later, either player1 is at pos22 or pos53 is not clear. In step5, the agent is at pos44 (after pushing from pos44 to pos45). Then, in step6, the agent is at pos45 (pushtogoal requires the agent to be at pos44, push to pos45, so after pushing, the agent is at pos45. Wait, no. Let's look at the pushtogoal action's effects:

After pushtogoal, the agent moves from l_p (pos44) to l_from (pos45), and the stone moves to l_to (pos55). So after step6, the agent is at pos45, and the stone is at pos55.

So in step5, the stone is at pos45 (pushtonongoal). The agent is at pos44 after pushing from pos44 to pos45. Then, in step5, pos45 is not clear (stone there). Then, in step6, the agent moves to pos44, then pushes the stone to pos55, ending up at pos45.

But during step5 (state after pushtonongoal), pos45 is not clear. Then, after that, in step6, the agent is at pos44, then pushes to pos55, moving to pos45. So in step6's state, the agent is at pos45. Therefore, in step6's state, pos53 is clear. So to satisfy constraint4, after pos45 is not clear (step5's state), there must be a state where player1 is at pos22 or pos53 is not clear. 

In this plan, after step5, the agent is at pos44. Then, step6 requires the agent to be at pos44 to push the stone from pos45 to pos55. So in step6's action:

pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos45 pos55 dirright

Preconditions: agent is at pos44, stone is at pos45, pos55 is clear (which it is initially). After this action, the agent moves to pos45, and the stone is at pos55.

So after step6, the agent is at pos45. Pos53 is clear unless the agent moves there. Therefore, in this plan, after step5, there's no state where player1 is at pos22 or pos53 is not clear. So this violates constraint4.

Therefore, this plan is invalid.

Alternative approach: After pushing the stone to pos45 (step5), the agent must move to pos53 to satisfy constraint4. So after step5, the agent is at pos44. The agent can move to pos43 (dirup), then to pos53 (dirright). This would make pos53 not clear when the agent is there. Then, the agent can push the stone from pos45 to pos55.

So revised steps:

5. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos44 pos45 dirright

6. move player1 pos44 pos43 dirup

7. move player1 pos43 pos53 dirright

8. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos53 pos45 pos55 dirdown

Wait, but pos45 is not adjacent to pos53. pos45 is (row4, column5), pos53 is (row5, column3). They are not adjacent. So the agent can't push from pos53 to pos45. Therefore, this approach won't work.

Alternative idea: After step5, the stone is at pos45. The agent is at pos44. To push the stone to pos55, the agent needs to be west of pos45 (pos44) and push east (dirright) to pos55. But pos44 to pos45 is dirdown, not dirright. According to movement connections:

From pos44, dirright is to pos54. So to push the stone from pos45 to pos55, the agent must be at pos45's west (pos44) and push east (dirright). But pos45's east is pos55 (assuming dirright increases column number). So if the agent is at pos44, which is west of pos45, and pushes east, the stone moves from pos45 to pos55. But according to the movement connections, can the agent push in that direction?

The action would be pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos45 pos55 dirright. But for this to be valid, the agent must be at pos44, and there must be a movement direction from pos44 to pos45, which is dirdown. Because according to the movement connections:

"You may move from location pos44 to location pos45 following direction dirdown"

So the direction from pos44 to pos45 is dirdown. Therefore, to push the stone east from pos45 to pos55, the agent must be at pos44 and push dirdown to pos45, but then the stone would be pushed dirdown from pos45 to pos55. But pos45 to pos55 is dirright (east), not dirdown. This indicates a conflict in directions.

This suggests that the agent cannot push the stone from pos45 to pos55 directly, because the direction from pos44 to pos45 is dirdown, but pos45 to pos55 is dirright. Therefore, the push action would require the agent to be at pos44, direction dirdown to pos45, and then push the stone in the same direction (dirdown) from pos45 to pos55. But according to the movement connections, pos45 can move dirdown to pos55 (from pos45 to pos55 via dirdown):

Looking at the movement connections:

"You may move from location pos45 to location pos55 following direction dirright"

Wait, no. The movement connections for pos45 are:

"You may move from location pos45 to location pos35 following direction dirleft"

"You may move from location pos45 to location pos55 following direction dirright"

"You may move from location pos45 to location pos44 following direction dirup"

So from pos45, dirright is to pos55. Therefore, to push the stone from pos45 to pos55, the agent must be at pos45's west (pos44), direction dirright. But according to the movement connections, from pos44 to pos45 is dirdown. Therefore, the agent cannot push the stone from pos45 to pos55 using the dirright direction because the agent is not adjacent in that direction.

Therefore, the agent must be at pos45's south (pos55) to push north, but pos55 is the goal and initially clear. So this is not possible. Hence, the stone cannot be pushed from pos45 to pos55 directly. Therefore, this path is invalid.

This means that the stone's path must go through pos54 to pos55. So the original plan of pos33 → pos34 → pos44 → pos54 → pos55 is the only valid path.

Therefore, to satisfy constraint3 (pos45 not clear), the agent must visit pos45 at some point. The shortest way is to have the agent move to pos45 after pushing the stone to pos54, then move back. But that adds steps.

Alternatively, perhaps during the agent's path to pos53, they can pass through pos45. For example, after pushing the stone to pos54, the agent is at pos44. They can move to pos45 (dirdown), then to pos44 (dirup), then to pos43 (dirup), then to pos53 (dirright). But this adds steps.

Alternatively, after pushing the stone to pos54 (step5), the agent is at pos44. Move to pos45 (dirdown), making pos45 not clear (satisfies constraint3). Then, move back to pos44 (dirup), then to pos43 (dirup), then to pos53 (dirright), then push to pos55.

So steps:

1. move player1 pos41 pos42 dirdown

2. move player1 pos42 pos32 dirleft

3. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos33 pos34 dirright

4. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos34 pos44 dirright

5. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos44 pos54 dirright

6. move player1 pos34 pos45 dirdown

7. move player1 pos45 pos44 dirup

8. move player1 pos44 pos43 dirup

9. move player1 pos43 pos53 dirright

10. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos53 pos54 pos55 dirdown

Now, pos45 is not clear in step6 (satisfies constraint3). Then, in step6's state, pos45 is not clear. According to constraint4, in that state or later, player1 must be at pos22 or pos53 not clear. After step6, the agent moves back to pos44 (step7), then to pos43 (step8), then to pos53 (step9), making pos53 not clear (step9). Therefore, in step9, pos53 is not clear, which is after step6. This satisfies constraint4.

Now, check other constraints:

- Constraint2: Before pos55 is not clear (step10), there must be an earlier state where player1 is at pos22 or pos43 is not clear. In this plan, the agent is at pos43 in step8, making pos43 not clear. This happens before step10, satisfying constraint2.

- Constraint5: pos25 is clear in every state. pos25 is never visited, so it remains clear.

Now, the plan has 10 steps. But perhaps there's a shorter way.

Alternative idea: After step5 (stone at pos54, agent at pos44), the agent moves to pos45 (step6), then immediately moves to pos55 (dirright from pos45), but pos55 is clear. So:

6. move player1 pos44 pos45 dirdown

7. move player1 pos45 pos55 dirright

But pos55 is clear, so this is allowed. Then, the agent is at pos55. But the stone is at pos54. The agent needs to push it to pos55. But the agent is at pos55, so they can't push from there. Therefore, this doesn't help.

Another idea: Combine steps. For example, after step5 (stone at pos54), the agent is at pos44. Instead of moving to pos45, the agent moves to pos43 (step6), then to pos53 (step7), then pushes to pos55. This would avoid the detour to pos45 but not satisfy constraint3. So we need to include a step where pos45 is not clear.

Thus, the minimal plan likely requires the extra steps to visit pos45. Therefore, the plan with 10 steps is the shortest possible given the constraints.

But maybe there's a smarter way. For example, after pushing the stone to pos44 (step4), the agent is at pos34. From there, the agent can move to pos35 (dirdown), then to pos45 (dirright), making pos45 not clear. Then, move back to pos35 (dirleft), pos34 (dirup), then push to pos54.

So steps:

1. move player1 pos41 pos42 dirdown

2. move player1 pos42 pos32 dirleft

3. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos33 pos34 dirright

4. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos34 pos44 dirright

5. move player1 pos34 pos35 dirdown

6. move player1 pos35 pos45 dirright

7. move player1 pos45 pos35 dirleft

8. move player1 pos35 pos34 dirup

9. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos44 pos54 dirright

10. move player1 pos34 pos43 dirup

11. move player1 pos43 pos53 dirright

12. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos53 pos54 pos55 dirdown

This is 12 steps, which is longer. So the previous plan with 10 steps is better.

Another alternative: After step3 (stone at pos34), the agent is at pos33. The agent can move to pos43 (dirright), then to pos44 (dirdown), then to pos45 (dirdown), making pos45 not clear. Then move back to pos44, pos43, pos53, and push. 

Steps:

1. move player1 pos41 pos42 dirdown

2. move player1 pos42 pos32 dirleft

3. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos33 pos34 dirright

4. move player1 pos33 pos43 dirright

5. move player1 pos43 pos44 dirdown

6. move player1 pos44 pos45 dirdown

7. move player1 pos45 pos44 dirup

8. move player1 pos44 pos43 dirup

9. move player1 pos43 pos53 dirright

10. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos44 pos54 dirright (wait, stone is at pos34, but after step3, the stone is at pos34. Then step4 is moving the agent, not pushing. So this approach is incorrect. The stone is at pos34 after step3. To push it to pos44, the agent must be at pos34's adjacent position.

Hmm, this approach is not valid. The agent must push the stone from pos34 to pos44, which requires being adjacent. After step3, the stone is at pos34, agent at pos33. Then, the agent moves to pos43, which is south of pos33. From there, they can't push the stone at pos34 unless they move back to pos33 or pos34.

This is getting too complicated. Perhaps the initial plan with the detour to pos45 (10 steps) is the shortest possible.

But let's count the steps in the initial plan with the pos45 detour:

1. move player1 pos41 pos42 dirdown

2. move player1 pos42 pos32 dirleft

3. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos33 pos34 dirright

4. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos34 pos44 dirright

5. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos44 pos54 dirright

6. move player1 pos34 pos45 dirdown

7. move player1 pos45 pos44 dirup

8. move player1 pos44 pos43 dirup

9. move player1 pos43 pos53 dirright

10. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos53 pos54 pos55 dirdown

This is 10 steps. Is there a way to combine steps or shorten this?

Wait, step6 and step7 could be combined if possible. After step5, the agent is at pos44. Then, moving to pos45 (step6) and back to pos44 (step7) could be avoided by using a different path. For example, after step5, the agent is at pos44. They need to satisfy pos45 not clear. So if they push the stone to pos45 instead of pos54. But that would require the stone to go to pos45, which is non-goal, then to pos55. But pos45 to pos55 is possible via pushtogoal if the agent is at pos44, pushing dirright to pos55.

Wait, let's try:

Revised plan:

1. move player1 pos41 pos42 dirdown

2. move player1 pos42 pos32 dirleft

3. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos33 pos34 dirright

4. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos34 pos44 dirright

5. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos44 pos45 dirright

6. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos45 pos55 dirright

This is 6 steps. Let's check if this works.

Step3: push from pos33 to pos34. Agent moves to pos33.

Step4: push from pos34 to pos44. Agent moves to pos34.

Step5: push from pos44 to pos45. Agent moves to pos44.

Step6: push from pos45 to pos55. Agent must be at pos44, direction dirright to pos45. Then push dirright to pos55.

But according to movement connections, from pos44 to pos45 is dirdown, not dirright. Therefore, the direction for step5 is dirdown. So step5 would be:

5. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos44 pos45 dirdown

Wait, no. The agent is at pos34 after step4. To push from pos44 to pos45, the agent must be adjacent to pos44 in direction d. pos44's west is pos34, south is pos45. So to push from pos44 to pos45 (dirdown), the agent must be north of pos44 (pos34). So step5 is:

pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos44 pos45 dirdown

After this, the agent is at pos44.

Then step6: push from pos45 to pos55. The agent must be adjacent to pos45 in direction d. pos45's west is pos44, east is pos55 (dirright). So to push from pos45 to pos55 (dirright), the agent must be at pos44 and push dirright. But according to movement connections, from pos44 to pos45 is dirdown, not dirright. Therefore, the agent can't push from pos44 to pos45 in dirright direction. Hence, this is invalid.

Therefore, the agent cannot push the stone from pos45 to pos55 directly. Hence, this approach is invalid.

Thus, the shortest valid plan is likely the 10-step plan incorporating the detour to pos45.

But let's verify all constraints again for the 10-step plan:

1. pos55 not clear in step10. Yes.

2. Before step10, in step8, pos43 is not clear (agent is there). Satisfied.

3. pos45 not clear in step6. Yes.

4. After step6 (pos45 not clear), in step9, pos53 is not clear (agent is there). Satisfied.

5. pos25 is always clear. Yes.

Therefore, this plan satisfies all constraints. However, the problem requires an optimal plan with minimal steps. Is there a shorter way?

Alternative approach: The agent could visit pos22 during the plan to satisfy constraint2 and constraint4. For example, after pushing the stone to pos34, the agent moves to pos22, which satisfies constraint2. Then, after pos45 is not clear, constraint4 is satisfied because the agent was at pos22 earlier.

Let's try:

1. move player1 pos41 pos42 dirdown

2. move player1 pos42 pos32 dirleft

3. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos33 pos34 dirright

4. move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown (invalid, pos34 has stone, not clear)

No, can't move there.

Alternative idea: After step3 (stone at pos34, agent at pos33), the agent moves to pos23, then pos22. So:

4. move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft

5. move player1 pos23 pos22 dirup

Now, agent is at pos22. This satisfies constraint2, as pos22 is visited before the stone is moved to pos55. Then, the agent can proceed to push the stone from pos34 to pos44, etc. Additionally, pos45 can be visited later.

But this adds steps. For example:

1. move player1 pos41 pos42 dirdown

2. move player1 pos42 pos32 dirleft

3. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos33 pos34 dirright

4. move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft

5. move player1 pos23 pos22 dirup

6. move player1 pos22 pos23 dirdown

7. move player1 pos23 pos33 dirright

8. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos34 pos44 dirright

9. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos44 pos54 dirright

10. move player1 pos34 pos45 dirdown

11. move player1 pos45 pos44 dirup

12. move player1 pos44 pos43 dirup

13. move player1 pos43 pos53 dirright

14. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos53 pos54 pos55 dirdown

This is 14 steps, which is longer. But the advantage is that by visiting pos22, constraint2 is satisfied, and constraint4 can be satisfied by the agent being at pos22 earlier. However, this is longer and not optimal.

Therefore, the initial 10-step plan remains the best option.

But perhaps there's a way to visit pos45 earlier. For example, after step3 (stone at pos34), the agent is at pos33. Then, move to pos34 (invalid), or pos43, then to pos44, then to pos45. So:

4. move player1 pos33 pos43 dirright

5. move player1 pos43 pos44 dirdown

6. move player1 pos44 pos45 dirdown (pos45 not clear)

7. move player1 pos45 pos44 dirup

8. move player1 pos44 pos34 dirup

9. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos44 pos54 dirright

10. move player1 pos34 pos43 dirup

11. move player1 pos43 pos53 dirright

12. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos53 pos54 pos55 dirdown

This is 12 steps, but satisfies constraint3 and constraint4 (pos45 not clear in step6, and later pos53 not clear in step11). Also, constraint2 is satisfied by step4-5 where agent is at pos43 (not clear). This plan has 12 steps. But the earlier 10-step plan is better.

Another alternative: The agent can move to pos45 after step2 (pos32) and before pushing the stone. For example:

1. move player1 pos41 pos42 dirdown

2. move player1 pos42 pos32 dirleft

3. move player1 pos32 pos42 dirright

4. move player1 pos42 pos43 dirdown

5. move player1 pos43 pos44 dirdown

6. move player1 pos44 pos45 dirdown

7. move player1 pos45 pos44 dirup

8. move player1 pos44 pos43 dirup

9. move player1 pos43 pos42 dirup

10. move player1 pos42 pos32 dirleft

11. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos33 pos34 dirright

...

This adds many steps and is not optimal.

After extensive consideration, the 10-step plan seems to be the shortest valid plan that satisfies all constraints.
