Let me understand the problem. We have:

1. A 5x5 grid (positions pos11 through pos55)
2. An agent (player1) initially at position pos41
3. A stone (stone1) initially at position pos33
4. A goal location at pos55
5. The task is to move the stone to the goal location

I need to produce a plan that satisfies these conditions using the available actions:
- move: Move the agent from one location to another
- pushtogoal: Push a stone to a goal location
- pushtonongoal: Push a stone to a non-goal location

Let's also note the constraints:
1. "Location pos55 is not clear" must be true in at least one state (this means the stone or the player must reach pos55)
2. If "Location pos55 is not clear" is true, then at some earlier state, either "player1 is at location pos22" or "Location pos43 is not clear" must be true
3. "Location pos45 is not clear" must be true in at least one state
4. If "Location pos45 is not clear" is true in state s, then either "player1 is at location pos22" or "Location pos53 is not clear" must be true in state s or later
5. "Location pos25 is clear" must be true in every state (so we can't have the player or stone at pos25)

Based on the grid layout, I'll assume the coordinates are organized as follows:
```
(1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (1,4) (1,5)
(2,1) (2,2) (2,3) (2,4) (2,5)
(3,1) (3,2) (3,3) (3,4) (3,5)
(4,1) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) (4,5)
(5,1) (5,2) (5,3) (5,4) (5,5)
```

So the player starts at pos41 (4,1) and the stone at pos33 (3,3). The goal is at pos55 (5,5).

Given the constraints, I need to:
1. Have the player go to pos22 at some point before the stone reaches pos55
2. Have either the player or stone at pos45 at some point
3. After pos45 is occupied, either have the player at pos22 or have something at pos53
4. Keep pos25 clear at all times

Let me plan a route for the player to reach the stone and then push it to the goal:

Initial state:
- Player at pos41
- Stone at pos33

To reach the stone, the player needs to move from pos41 to pos33. A direct path would be:
1. Move player1 from pos41 to pos31 following dirleft
2. Move player1 from pos31 to pos32 following dirdown
3. Move player1 from pos32 to pos33 following dirdown

But now the player is at pos33 where the stone is, which is impossible. The player should be adjacent to the stone to push it. Let me rethink this.

The player needs to be adjacent to the stone to push it. So if the stone is at pos33, the player needs to be at one of the adjacent positions: pos23, pos32, pos34, or pos43.

Initial setup:
- Player at pos41
- Stone at pos33

Let me try to plan a path to push the stone to pos55 (the goal):

1. Move player1 from pos41 to pos31 following dirleft
2. Move player1 from pos31 to pos32 following dirdown

Now the player is at pos32, which is to the "up" of the stone at pos33. 

3. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos33 pos34 dirdown

Now the player is at pos33 and the stone is at pos34.

4. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos34 pos35 dirdown

Now the player is at pos34 and the stone is at pos35.

5. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos35 pos45 dirright

Now the player is at pos35 and the stone is at pos45.

6. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos35 pos45 pos55 dirright

Now the player is at pos45 and the stone is at pos55 (the goal location).

Let's check if this plan satisfies our constraints:

1. "Location pos55 is not clear" - This is satisfied because the stone ends up at pos55.
2. If "Location pos55 is not clear", then at some earlier state either "player1 is at location pos22" or "Location pos43 is not clear" must be true - This is NOT satisfied because the player never visits pos22 and nothing is ever at pos43.
3. "Location pos45 is not clear" - This is satisfied when the stone is at pos45.
4. If "Location pos45 is not clear", then either "player1 is at location pos22" or "Location pos53 is not clear" must be true at that state or later - This is NOT satisfied because the player never visits pos22 and nothing is ever at pos53.
5. "Location pos25 is clear" - This is satisfied because neither the player nor the stone ever visits pos25.

My plan doesn't satisfy constraints 2 and 4. Let me revise the plan to make sure the player visits pos22 before pushing the stone to pos55.

Initial setup:
- Player at pos41
- Stone at pos33

Updated plan:
1. Move player1 from pos41 to pos31 following dirleft
2. Move player1 from pos31 to pos21 following dirleft
3. Move player1 from pos21 to pos22 following dirdown

Now the player has visited pos22, satisfying part of constraint 2.

4. Move player1 from pos22 to pos32 following dirright

Now the player is at pos32, which is adjacent to the stone at pos33.

5. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos33 pos34 dirdown

Now the player is at pos33 and the stone is at pos34.

6. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos34 pos35 dirdown

Now the player is at pos34 and the stone is at pos35.

7. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos35 pos45 dirright

Now the player is at pos35 and the stone is at pos45. This satisfies constraint 3.

Now for constraint 4, after the stone is at pos45, we need either the player at pos22 or something at pos53. 

8. Move player1 from pos35 to pos34 following dirup
9. Move player1 from pos34 to pos33 following dirup
10. Move player1 from pos33 to pos43 following dirright
11. Move player1 from pos43 to pos53 following dirright

Now the player is at pos53, satisfying constraint 4.

12. Move player1 from pos53 to pos43 following dirleft
13. Move player1 from pos43 to pos44 following dirdown
14. Move player1 from pos44 to pos45 following dirdown

Now the player is at pos45, adjacent to the stone which is at pos45. Wait, this is a contradiction. Let me rethink...

The stone needs to be at one position, so it can't be at both pos45 and pos55 in the final state. Let me revise my understanding.

The constraints state:
1. "Location pos55 is not clear" must be true in at least one state - This means at some point in our plan, either the player or the stone must occupy pos55.
2. If "Location pos55 is not clear", then at some earlier state either "player1 is at location pos22" or "Location pos43 is not clear" must be true - This means before we occupy pos55, we must either have the player visit pos22 or have something (player or stone) at pos43.
3. "Location pos45 is not clear" must be true in at least one state - This means at some point, either the player or the stone must occupy pos45.
4. If "Location pos45 is not clear", then either "player1 is at location pos22" or "Location pos53 is not clear" must be true at that state or later - This means either before, during, or after we occupy pos45, we must either have the player visit pos22 or have something at pos53.
5. "Location pos25 is clear" must be true in every state - This means neither the player nor the stone can ever occupy pos25.

With this understanding, let me revise my plan:

Initial setup:
- Player at pos41
- Stone at pos33

1. Move player1 from pos41 to pos31 following dirleft
2. Move player1 from pos31 to pos21 following dirleft
3. Move player1 from pos21 to pos22 following dirdown

Now the player has visited pos22, satisfying part of constraints 2 and 4.

4. Move player1 from pos22 to pos32 following dirright

Now the player is at pos32, which is adjacent to the stone at pos33.

5. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos33 pos34 dirdown

Now the player is at pos33 and the stone is at pos34.

6. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos34 pos35 dirdown

Now the player is at pos34 and the stone is at pos35.

7. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos35 pos45 dirright

Now the player is at pos35 and the stone is at pos45. This satisfies constraint 3.

8. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos35 pos45 pos55 dirright

Now the player is at pos45 and the stone is at pos55 (the goal location). This satisfies constraint 1.

Let's check if this plan satisfies all our constraints:

1. "Location pos55 is not clear" - Satisfied when the stone is at pos55.
2. If "Location pos55 is not clear", then at some earlier state either "player1 is at location pos22" or "Location pos43 is not clear" must be true - Satisfied because the player visits pos22 (steps 3) before the stone reaches pos55 (step 8).
3. "Location pos45 is not clear" - Satisfied when the stone is at pos45 (step 7).
4. If "Location pos45 is not clear", then either "player1 is at location pos22" or "Location pos53 is not clear" must be true at that state or later - Satisfied because the player has already visited pos22 (step 3) before the stone reaches pos45 (step 7).
5. "Location pos25 is clear" - Satisfied because neither the player nor the stone ever visits pos25.

It looks like this plan should satisfy all the constraints. Let me double-check the preconditions for each action:

1. Move player1 from pos41 to pos31 following dirleft:
   - player1 is at location pos41 ✓
   - location pos31 is clear ✓
   - You may move from location pos41 to location pos31 following dirleft ✓

2. Move player1 from pos31 to pos21 following dirleft:
   - player1 is at location pos31 (after step 1) ✓
   - location pos21 is clear ✓
   - You may move from location pos31 to location pos21 following dirleft ✓

3. Move player1 from pos21 to pos22 following dirdown:
   - player1 is at location pos21 (after step 2) ✓
   - location pos22 is clear ✓
   - You may move from location pos21 to location pos22 following dirdown ✓

4. Move player1 from pos22 to pos32 following dirright:
   - player1 is at location pos22 (after step 3) ✓
   - location pos32 is clear ✓
   - You may move from location pos22 to location pos32 following dirright ✓

5. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos33 pos34 dirdown:
   - player1 is at location pos32 (after step 4) ✓
   - stone1 is at location pos33 ✓
   - location pos34 is clear ✓
   - You may move from location pos32 to location pos33 following dirdown ✓
   - You may move from location pos33 to location pos34 following dirdown ✓
   - location pos34 is not a goal location ✓

6. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos34 pos35 dirdown:
   - player1 is at location pos33 (after step 5) ✓
   - stone1 is at location pos34 (after step 5) ✓
   - location pos35 is clear ✓
   - You may move from location pos33 to location pos34 following dirdown ✓
   - You may move from location pos34 to location pos35 following dirdown ✓
   - location pos35 is not a goal location ✓

7. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos35 pos45 dirright:
   - player1 is at location pos34 (after step 6) ✓
   - stone1 is at location pos35 (after step 6) ✓
   - location pos45 is clear ✓
   - You may move from location pos34 to location pos35 following dirdown ✓
   - You may move from location pos35 to location pos45 following dirright ✓
   - location pos45 is not a goal location ✓

8. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos35 pos45 pos55 dirright:
   - player1 is at location pos35 (after step 7) ✓
   - stone1 is at location pos45 (after step 7) ✓
   - location pos55 is clear ✓
   - You may move from location pos35 to location pos45 following dirright ✓
   - You may move from location pos45 to location pos55 following dirright ✓
   - location pos55 is a goal location ✓

All the preconditions are met, so this plan should work.

Hmm, let me double check something. In step 7, we're pushing from pos35 to pos45 using dirright. But I'm confused about the direction here. If we're using a grid where the first coordinate is the row and the second coordinate is the column, then going from pos35 to pos45 would be a move down (or "up" in the opposite direction), not a move right.

Let me consider the grid layout more carefully:
```
pos11 pos12 pos13 pos14 pos15
pos21 pos22 pos23 pos24 pos25
pos31 pos32 pos33 pos34 pos35
pos41 pos42 pos43 pos44 pos45
pos51 pos52 pos53 pos54 pos55
```

In this layout, moving from pos35 to pos45 would be a move down, which would correspond to dirdown, not dirright. Similarly, moving from pos45 to pos55 would be a move right, which would correspond to dirright.

Let me check the available moves from the problem description:

"You may move from location pos35 to location pos45 following direction dirright"
"You may move from location pos45 to location pos55 following direction dirright"

I can see that moving from pos35 to pos45 and from pos45 to pos55 should use dirright. This suggests that the grid layout might be different from what I assumed. Let me reconsider the layout:

```
pos11    pos12    pos13    pos14    pos15
                                   
pos21    pos22    pos23    pos24    pos25
                                   
pos31    pos32    pos33    pos34    pos35
                                   
pos41    pos42    pos43    pos44    pos45
                                   
pos51    pos52    pos53    pos54    pos55
```

Reading the problem description again, I can interpret the grid structure based on the actions. Since we can go from pos35 to pos45 following dirright, and from pos45 to pos55 following dirright, and from pos41 to pos51 following dirright, I can conclude that the first digit represents the column and the second digit represents the row. So the grid would be something like:

```
pos11 pos21 pos31 pos41 pos51
pos12 pos22 pos32 pos42 pos52
pos13 pos23 pos33 pos43 pos53
pos14 pos24 pos34 pos44 pos54
pos15 pos25 pos35 pos45 pos55
```

This means dirright moves us to the right (increasing the first digit), dirleft moves us to the left (decreasing the first digit), dirdown moves us down (increasing the second digit), and dirup moves us up (decreasing the second digit).

Let me revise my understanding:
- Player starts at pos41 (column 4, row 1)
- Stone starts at pos33 (column 3, row 3)
- Goal is at pos55 (column 5, row 5)

Now, let me revise the plan:

Initial setup:
- Player at pos41 (column 4, row 1)
- Stone at pos33 (column 3, row 3)

The player needs to first reach pos22 to satisfy constraints 2 and 4. Then the player needs to push the stone from pos33 eventually to pos55.

1. Move player1 from pos41 to pos31 following dirleft
2. Move player1 from pos31 to pos21 following dirleft
3. Move player1 from pos21 to pos22 following dirdown

Now the player has visited pos22, satisfying part of constraints 2 and 4.

4. Move player1 from pos22 to pos23 following dirdown
5. Move player1 from pos23 to pos33 following dirright

Wait, now the player and the stone are both at pos33, which is impossible. The player should be adjacent to the stone to push it. Let me rethink this.

If the stone is at pos33, the player can push it from:
- pos23 (push down)
- pos43 (push left)
- pos32 (push right)
- pos34 (push up)

Let me revise the path:

1. Move player1 from pos41 to pos31 following dirleft
2. Move player1 from pos31 to pos32 following dirdown
3. Move player1 from pos32 to pos22 following dirleft

Now the player has visited pos22, satisfying part of constraints 2 and 4.

4. Move player1 from pos22 to pos32 following dirright

Now the player is at pos32, which is adjacent to the stone at pos33.

5. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos33 pos34 dirright

Now the player is at pos33 and the stone is at pos34.

6. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos34 pos35 dirright

Now the player is at pos34 and the stone is at pos35.

7. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos35 pos45 dirdown

Now the player is at pos35 and the stone is at pos45. This satisfies constraint 3.

8. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos35 pos45 pos55 dirright

Now the player is at pos45 and the stone is at pos55 (the goal location). This satisfies constraint 1 and the goal.

Let me check if this plan satisfies all our constraints:

1. "Location pos55 is not clear" - Satisfied when the stone is at pos55.
2. If "Location pos55 is not clear", then at some earlier state either "player1 is at location pos22" or "Location pos43 is not clear" must be true - Satisfied because the player visits pos22 (step 3) before the stone reaches pos55 (step 8).
3. "Location pos45 is not clear" - Satisfied when the stone is at pos45 (step 7).
4. If "Location pos45 is not clear", then either "player1 is at location pos22" or "Location pos53 is not clear" must be true at that state or later - Satisfied because the player has already visited pos22 (step 3) before the stone reaches pos45 (step 7).
5. "Location pos25 is clear" - Satisfied because neither the player nor the stone ever visits pos25.

In this plan, the player never visits pos43, and nothing ever occupies pos53. But that's fine, because the constraints are satisfied by the player visiting pos22 before the stone reaches pos55 and before the stone reaches pos45.

Let me double-check that my direction understanding is correct for the actions in steps 5, 7, and 8:

"You may move from location pos32 to location pos33 following direction dirright"
"You may move from location pos33 to location pos34 following direction dirright"
"You may move from location pos34 to location pos35 following direction dirright"
"You may move from location pos35 to location pos45 following direction dirdown"
"You may move from location pos45 to location pos55 following direction dirright"

OK, now let me verify the preconditions, assuming "dirright" means "increase first digit", "dirdown" means "increase second digit", etc.:

1. Move player1 from pos41 to pos31 following dirleft:
   - player1 is at location pos41 ✓
   - location pos31 is clear ✓
   - You may move from location pos41 to location pos31 following dirleft ✓

2. Move player1 from pos31 to pos32 following dirdown:
   - player1 is at location pos31 (after step 1) ✓
   - location pos32 is clear ✓
   - You may move from location pos31 to location pos32 following dirdown ✓

3. Move player1 from pos32 to pos22 following dirleft:
   - player1 is at location pos32 (after step 2) ✓
   - location pos22 is clear ✓
   - You may move from location pos32 to location pos22 following dirleft ✓

4. Move player1 from pos22 to pos32 following dirright:
   - player1 is at location pos22 (after step 3) ✓
   - location pos32 is clear (after player leaves, before player returns) ✓
   - You may move from location pos22 to location pos32 following dirright ✓

5. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos33 pos34 dirright:
   - player1 is at location pos32 (after step 4) ✓
   - stone1 is at location pos33 ✓
   - location pos34 is clear ✓
   - You may move from location pos32 to location pos33 following dirright ✓
   - You may move from location pos33 to location pos34 following dirright ✓
   - location pos34 is not a goal location ✓

6. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos34 pos35 dirright:
   - player1 is at location pos33 (after step 5) ✓
   - stone1 is at location pos34 (after step 5) ✓
   - location pos35 is clear ✓
   - You may move from location pos33 to location pos34 following dirright ✓
   - You may move from location pos34 to location pos35 following dirright ✓
   - location pos35 is not a goal location ✓

7. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos35 pos45 dirdown:
   - player1 is at location pos34 (after step 6) ✓
   - stone1 is at location pos35 (after step 6) ✓
   - location pos45 is clear ✓
   - You may move from location pos34 to location pos35 following dirright ✓
   - You may move from location pos35 to location pos45 following dirdown ✓
   - location pos45 is not a goal location ✓

8. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos35 pos45 pos55 dirright:
   - player1 is at location pos35 (after step 7) ✓
   - stone1 is at location pos45 (after step 7) ✓
   - location pos55 is clear ✓
   - You may move from location pos35 to location pos45 following dirdown ✓
   - You may move from location pos45 to location pos55 following dirright ✓
   - location pos55 is a goal location ✓

Wait, in step 7, I think I need to use "dirright" instead of "dirdown" to go from pos34 to pos35. And in step 8, I need to make sure I have the correct directions to go from pos35 to pos45 and from pos45 to pos55.

Let's check the possible moves again:

"You may move from location pos34 to location pos35 following direction dirdown" - OK, I had the wrong direction
"You may move from location pos35 to location pos45 following direction dirright" - OK, I had the wrong direction
"You may move from location pos45 to location pos55 following direction dirright" - OK, this is still correct

So it seems the grid layout is different than I thought.

Let's just check all the moves involving pos35:
"You may move from location pos25 to location pos35 following direction dirright"
"You may move from location pos34 to location pos35 following direction dirdown"
"You may move from location pos35 to location pos25 following direction dirleft"
"You may move from location pos35 to location pos45 following direction dirright"
"You may move from location pos35 to location pos34 following direction dirup"

OK, so this clarifies things:

- Going from pos25 to pos35 is going right
- Going from pos34 to pos35 is going down
- Going from pos35 to pos25 is going left
- Going from pos35 to pos45 is going right
- Going from pos35 to pos34 is going up

So "right" corresponds to increasing the first digit, "down" corresponds to increasing the second digit. This is confusing because usually, in a grid, the first coordinate is the row and the second is the column, but here it seems to be the other way around. But let's just go with it.

Final plan with corrected directions:

1. Move player1 from pos41 to pos31 following dirleft
2. Move player1 from pos31 to pos32 following dirdown
3. Move player1 from pos32 to pos22 following dirleft
4. Move player1 from pos22 to pos32 following dirright
5. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos33 pos34 dirright
6. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos34 pos35 dirright
7. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos35 pos45 dirdown
8. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos35 pos45 pos55 dirright

Actually, let's try once more with a different interpretation of the grid layout. I'll map the positions as:

```
(1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (4,1) (5,1)
(1,2) (2,2) (3,2) (4,2) (5,2)
(1,3) (2,3) (3,3) (4,3) (5,3)
(1,4) (2,4) (3,4) (4,4) (5,4)
(1,5) (2,5) (3,5) (4,5) (5,5)
```

And positions are denoted as pos<column><row>.

So the player starts at pos41 (column 4, row 1), the stone at pos33 (column 3, row 3), and the goal is at pos55 (column 5, row 5).

The directions are:
- dirright: Increase column (e.g., pos41 to pos51)
- dirleft: Decrease column (e.g., pos41 to pos31)
- dirdown: Increase row (e.g., pos41 to pos42)
- dirup: Decrease row (e.g., pos42 to pos41)

Let me check if this matches the available moves:

"You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright" - ✓
"You may move from location pos11 to location pos12 following direction dirdown" - ✓
"You may move from location pos12 to location pos22 following direction dirright" - ✓
"You may move from location pos12 to location pos11 following direction dirup" - ✓

This interpretation seems correct.

Now, to reach pos33 from pos41, the player can move:
1. pos41 -> pos31 (dirleft)
2. pos31 -> pos32 (dirdown)
3. pos32 -> pos33 (dirdown)

But pos33 is occupied by the stone, so the player should be adjacent to it. Let me rethink.

If the stone is at pos33, the player can push it from:
- pos23 (push from left)
- pos43 (push from right)
- pos32 (push from up)
- pos34 (push from down)

Let me revise the plan:

1. Move player1 from pos41 to pos31 following dirleft
2. Move player1 from pos31 to pos21 following dirleft
3. Move player1 from pos21 to pos22 following dirdown

Now the player has visited pos22, satisfying part of constraints 2 and 4.

4. Move player1 from pos22 to pos23 following dirdown
5. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos33 pos43 dirright

Now the player is at pos33 and the stone is at pos43.

6. Move player1 from pos33 to pos34 following dirdown
7. Move player1 from pos34 to pos44 following dirright
8. Move player1 from pos44 to pos43 following dirup
9. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos43 pos42 dirup - Wait, there's an error here.

Let me think again. Since the stone is initially at pos33, I can:

1. Move player1 from pos41 to pos31 following dirleft
2. Move player1 from pos31 to pos21 following dirleft
3. Move player1 from pos21 to pos22 following dirdown
4. Move player1 from pos22 to pos23 following dirdown
5. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos33 pos43 dirright

Now the player is at pos33 and the stone is at pos43.

6. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos43 pos44 dirdown

Now the player is at pos43 and the stone is at pos44.

7. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos44 pos45 dirright

Now the player is at pos44 and the stone is at pos45.

8. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos45 pos55 dirright

Now the player is at pos45 and the stone is at pos55 (the goal location).

This satisfies constraints 1, 3, and 5. It also satisfies constraints 2 and 4 because the player has already visited pos22 (step 3) before the stone reaches pos55 (step 8) and before the stone reaches pos45 (step 7).

Let me check if this plan is valid, taking extra care to check the preconditions of each step:

1. Move player1 from pos41 to pos31 following dirleft:
   - player1 is at location pos41 ✓
   - location pos31 is clear ✓
   - You may move from location pos41 to location pos31 following dirleft ✓

2. Move player1 from pos31 to pos21 following dirleft:
   - player1 is at location pos31 (after step 1) ✓
   - location pos21 is clear ✓
   - You may move from location pos31 to location pos21 following dirleft ✓

3. Move player1 from pos21 to pos22 following dirdown:
   - player1 is at location pos21 (after step 2) ✓
   - location pos22 is clear ✓
   - You may move from location pos21 to location pos22 following dirdown ✓

4. Move player1 from pos22 to pos23 following dirdown:
   - player1 is at location pos22 (after step 3) ✓
   - location pos23 is clear ✓
   - You may move from location pos22 to location pos23 following dirdown ✓

5. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos33 pos43 dirright:
   - player1 is at location pos23 (after step 4) ✓
   - stone1 is at location pos33 ✓
   - location pos43 is clear ✓
   - You may move from location pos23 to location pos33 following dirright ✓
   - You may move from location pos33 to location pos43 following dirright ✓
   - location pos43 is not a goal location ✓

6. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos43 pos44 dirdown:
   - player1 is at location pos33 (after step 5) ✓
   - stone1 is at location pos43 (after step 5) ✓
   - location pos44 is clear ✓
   - You may move from location pos33 to location pos43 following dirright ✓
   - You may move from location pos43 to location pos44 following dirdown ✓
   - location pos44 is not a goal location ✓

7. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos44 pos45 dirright:
   - player1 is at location pos43 (after step 6) ✓
   - stone1 is at location pos44 (after step 6) ✓
   - location pos45 is clear ✓
   - You may move from location pos43 to location pos44 following dirright ✓
   - You may move from location pos44 to location pos45 following dirright ✓
   - location pos45 is not a goal location ✓

8. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos45 pos55 dirright:
   - player1 is at location pos44 (after step 7) ✓
   - stone1 is at location pos45 (after step 7) ✓
   - location pos55 is clear ✓
   - You may move from location pos44 to location pos45 following dirright ✓
   - You may move from location pos45 to location pos55 following dirright ✓
   - location pos55 is a goal location ✓

This plan should work, but I just noticed a problem with step 6. The player is at pos33 and the stone is at pos43, so the player should move dirright to push the stone, but that doesn't match the "from" position in the action. Let me correct this:

6. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos43 pos44 dirright:
   - player1 is at location pos33 (after step 5) ✓
   - stone1 is at location pos43 (after step 5) ✓
   - location pos44 is clear ✓
   - You may move from location pos33 to location pos43 following dirright ✓
   - You may move from location pos43 to location pos44 following dirright ✓
   - location pos44 is not a goal location ✓

Wait, this doesn't make sense either. Let's read the action definition again:

"pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": Make agent p, situated at location l_p, push stone s from location l_from to goal location l_to, following direction d.
"pushtonongoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": Make agent p, situated at location l_p, push stone s from location l_from to non-goal location l_to, following direction d.

Here are the preconditions:

"pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": You may only perform this action if (i) agent p is at location l_p, (ii) stone s is at location l_from, (iii) location l_to is clear, (iv) you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d, (v) you can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d, and (vi) location l_to is a goal location.
"pushtonongoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": You may only perform this action if (i) agent p is at location l_p, (ii) stone s is at location l_from, (iii) location l_to is clear, (iv) you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d, (v) you can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d, and (vi) location l_to is not a goal location.

This means the "dirright" in step 6 is incorrect. The direction should be the direction to get from the player's position to the stone's position and from the stone's position to the destination. So for step 6, the direction should be dirright, since the player is at pos33, the stone is at pos43, and the destination is pos44.

Let me correct the plan:

1. Move player1 from pos41 to pos31 following dirleft
2. Move player1 from pos31 to pos21 following dirleft
3. Move player1 from pos21 to pos22 following dirdown
4. Move player1 from pos22 to pos23 following dirdown
5. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos33 pos43 dirright
6. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos43 pos44 dirright
7. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos44 pos45 dirright
8. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos45 pos55 dirright

This plan should work.

Let me check all the preconditions one more time for steps 5-8:

5. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos33 pos43 dirright:
   - player1 is at location pos23 (after step 4) ✓
   - stone1 is at location pos33 ✓
   - location pos43 is clear ✓
   - You may move from location pos23 to location pos33 following dirright ✓
   - You may move from location pos33 to location pos43 following dirright ✓
   - location pos43 is not a goal location ✓

6. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos43 pos44 dirright:
   - player1 is at location pos33 (after step 5) ✓
   - stone1 is at location pos43 (after step 5) ✓
   - location pos44 is clear ✓
   - You may move from location pos33 to location pos43 following dirright ✓
   - You may move from location pos43 to location pos44 following dirright ✓
   - location pos44 is not a goal location ✓

7. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos44 pos45 dirright:
   - player1 is at location pos43 (after step 6) ✓
   - stone1 is at location pos44 (after step 6) ✓
   - location pos45 is clear ✓
   - You may move from location pos43 to location pos44 following dirright ✓
   - You may move from location pos44 to location pos45 following dirright ✓
   - location pos45 is not a goal location ✓

8. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos45 pos55 dirright:
   - player1 is at location pos44 (after step 7) ✓
   - stone1 is at location pos45 (after step 7) ✓
   - location pos55 is clear ✓
   - You may move from location pos44 to location pos45 following dirright ✓
   - You may move from location pos45 to location pos55 following dirright ✓
   - location pos55 is a goal location ✓

Actually, there's something else I need to double-check:

In step 5, the player is at pos23 and is trying to push the stone from pos33 to pos43 following dirright. But for this to work, the player needs to be adjacent to the stone in the direction opposite to the push. So the player should be at pos43 to push the stone from pos33 to pos43. This doesn't make sense.

Let me reread the preconditions more carefully:

"pushtonongoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": You may only perform this action if (i) agent p is at location l_p, (ii) stone s is at location l_from, (iii) location l_to is clear, (iv) you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d, (v) you can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d, and (vi) location l_to is not a goal location.

So for step 5, the player is at pos23, the stone is at pos33, and we want to push it to pos43. The direction d should be dirright, since you can get from pos23 to pos33 following dirright, and you can get from pos33 to pos43 following dirright.

So my plan does have the correct directions. Let's stick with:

1. Move player1 from pos41 to pos31 following dirleft
2. Move player1 from pos31 to pos21 following dirleft
3. Move player1 from pos21 to pos22 following dirdown
4. Move player1 from pos22 to pos23 following dirdown
5. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos33 pos43 dirright
6. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos43 pos44 dirright
7. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos44 pos45 dirright
8. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos45 pos55 dirright

(In a normal Sokoban game, the player would need to be on the opposite side of the stone to push it, but it seems the action definition for this problem is different.)

But let's double check once more that we're using the correct format:

"pushtonongoal p s l_p l_from l_to d"

Here:
p: The agent (player1)
s: The stone (stone1)
l_p: The location of the agent (e.g., pos23)
l_from: The location of the stone (e.g., pos33)
l_to: The destination for the stone (e.g., pos43)
d: The direction (e.g., dirright)

Using this format, step 5 should be:

5. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos33 pos43 dirright

OK, so the directions in my plan are actually correct.

Now, let's check if the plan satisfies all the constraints:

1. "Location pos55 is not clear" - Satisfied when the stone is at pos55.
2. If "Location pos55 is not clear", then at some earlier state either "player1 is at location pos22" or "Location pos43 is not clear" must be true - Satisfied because the player visits pos22 (step 3) before the stone reaches pos55 (step 8).
3. "Location pos45 is not clear" - Satisfied when the stone is at pos45.
4. If "Location pos45 is not clear", then either "player1 is at location pos22" or "Location pos53 is not clear" must be true at that state or later - Satisfied because the player has already visited pos22 (step 3) before the stone reaches pos45 (step 7).
5. "Location pos25 is clear" - Satisfied because neither the player nor the stone ever visits pos25.

My final submitted plan is:

1. Move player1 from pos41 to pos31 following dirleft
2. Move player1 from pos31 to pos21 following dirleft
3. Move player1 from pos21 to pos22 following dirdown
4. Move player1 from pos22 to pos23 following dirdown
