Okay, let's try to figure out how to solve this planning problem. The goal is to get stone1 to a goal location, which in this case is pos25. The constraints add some complexity, so I need to make sure each one is satisfied.

First, the initial state: the agent (player1) is at pos55, and stone1 is at pos42. The goal location is pos25. So I need to move stone1 from pos42 to pos25. Let me visualize the grid. pos42 is in row 4, column 2. pos25 is row 2, column 5. Wait, maybe rows are vertical? Let me check the movement directions. For example, moving from pos11 to pos21 is dirright, which probably means right direction, so columns increase when moving right. Similarly, pos11 to pos12 is dirdown, so rows increase when moving down. So posXY: X is row, Y is column. So pos42 is row 4, column 2. pos25 is row 2, column 5.

To move the stone from pos42 to pos25, the agent needs to push it. But first, the agent has to get to a position adjacent to the stone to push it. Let's see the possible paths.

Starting at pos55, the agent can move up to pos54, then up to pos53, etc. Alternatively, moving left to pos45, then up. Let's see the movement possibilities. From pos55, the agent can move left to pos45 via dirleft, or up to pos54 via dirup. Let's check the allowed movements:

Looking at the "You may move from" list, for pos55: "You may move from location pos55 to location pos45 following direction dirleft" and "You may move from location pos55 to location pos54 following direction dirup". So the agent can go left to pos45 or up to pos54.

The stone is at pos42. So the agent needs to reach a position adjacent to pos42 to push it. pos42's adjacent locations would be pos32 (up), pos52 (down), pos41 (left?), pos43 (right). Wait, movement directions: for example, from pos42, moving dirleft would be to pos32? Wait, let's check. For pos42, the possible moves are:

From the list, "You may move from location pos42 to location pos32 following direction dirleft" (so left direction from pos42 is to pos32), to pos52 via dirright (right direction?), to pos41 via dirup (up?), and pos43 via dirdown (down). Wait, maybe directions are a bit confusing here. Let me clarify.

Looking at the movement from pos41 to pos42 is dirdown. So pos41 is row 4, column1. pos42 is row4, column2. So moving down from pos41 would be to pos42? Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe movement directions are relative. For example, "dirdown" might mean moving to the next row down, which would increase the row number. But the movement from pos11 to pos12 is dirdown, which makes sense if pos12 is row1, column2. Wait, maybe the grid is structured with rows increasing vertically down. So pos11 is top-left, pos15 is top-right, pos51 is bottom-left, pos55 is bottom-right. So moving down from pos11 would take you to pos21, but according to the given moves, "You may move from location pos11 to location pos12 following direction dirdown". Wait, that's conflicting. Because if pos11 is (1,1), then moving right would be to (1,2), which is pos12. Moving down would be to (2,1), pos21. But according to the given movement, pos11 can move to pos21 via dirright? Wait, no. Let's check again.

Wait, in the list of movements, "You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright". That suggests that dirright from pos11 takes you to pos21. But pos21 is row2, column1. So that's moving down. Hmm, perhaps the directions are named differently. Maybe dirright means moving along the row (changing column), and dirdown means moving along the column (changing row). Wait, that's possible. For example, pos11 (row1, column1) moving dirright to pos12 (row1, column2), which is correct. Then moving dirdown from pos11 would take to pos21 (row2, column1). But the given movement from pos11 is "You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright". Wait, that's confusing. Because dirright should be same row, next column. But according to the given movement, moving dirright from pos11 takes you to pos21, which is down a row. That doesn't make sense. So maybe the directions are mislabeled. Alternatively, maybe the grid is structured such that moving dirright increases the row instead of the column. That would complicate things, but perhaps that's how it is here. Let's look at another example.

From pos12: "You may move from location pos12 to location pos22 following direction dirright". If pos12 is row1, column2, then dirright to pos22 (row2, column2) would be moving down. So in this case, dirright is moving down. That seems odd. Alternatively, maybe the directions are based on the grid's orientation. For example, if the grid is laid out such that moving right (dirright) increases the row number, and moving down (dirdown) increases the column. That might be the case here. Alternatively, perhaps the directions are not aligned with typical Cartesian coordinates. This is critical for planning.

Alternatively, perhaps the movement directions are as follows: each location has four possible directions (up, down, left, right) but the actual movement is determined by the grid's connectivity. So the direction names (dirup, dirdown, dirleft, dirright) might not correspond to the actual grid directions but are just labels. For example, moving from pos11 to pos21 is dirright, but that's actually moving down. So the directions are just labels for allowed transitions, and we need to check the movement possibilities as given.

Given that, let's not get confused with the direction names and instead focus on the actual movement graph. Let's create a graph of possible moves to plan the path.

The agent starts at pos55. The stone is at pos42. The goal is pos25 (which is a goal location). The constraints:

1. At least one state where pos25 is not clear. Since pos25 is a goal location, and stone1 must end up there, this will naturally happen when the stone is pushed there, but perhaps before that. Wait, the final state must have stone1 at pos25, so pos25 will not be clear in the final state, which satisfies the first constraint. But the problem says "must hold in at least one state", so that's covered.

2. If pos25 is not clear in some state s, then either pos51 is not clear or stone1 is at pos11 must hold in s or after. Since stone1 is moved to pos25, which is a goal, the pushtogoal action would put stone1 there, making pos25 not clear. Then, after that, stone1 is at pos25 (goal), so the second part of the implication is not satisfied (stone1 is not at pos11), so we must ensure that pos51 is not clear at some point after. But pos51 is initially clear. How can we make pos51 not clear? The agent would have to move there. So maybe after moving the stone to pos25, the agent must move to pos51, making pos51 not clear. That would satisfy the constraint.

3. pos31 must not be clear in at most one continuous sequence. So pos31 can be occupied (by agent or stone) only once in a consecutive period. For example, if the agent moves into pos31, stays there, then leaves, that's one continuous sequence. If the agent comes back later, that's another, which would violate the constraint. So we need to ensure that pos31 is only occupied in one continuous block.

4. pos52 must be not clear in at least one state. So the agent or a stone must be there at some point. Since the stone is at pos42 initially, moving it to pos52 would be possible, but that's a non-goal location, so we would use pushtonongoal. But the final goal is to get stone1 to a goal location. Alternatively, the agent can move through pos52. For example, after moving the stone, the agent might pass through pos52.

5. If pos52 is not clear in some state, there must be a prior state where the agent is at pos51. So to make pos52 not clear, the agent could move there from pos51. So for example, the agent moves to pos51, then to pos52. That would satisfy the constraint.

Now, let's plan the steps.

First, the agent needs to reach the stone at pos42. The stone is at pos42. To push the stone, the agent needs to be at a location adjacent to pos42 in the direction from which the stone can be pushed. For example, to push the stone from pos42 to pos43 (dirdown?), the agent would need to be at pos42's up direction (pos32?), but that's getting confusing. Let's check the allowed push directions.

Wait, the pushtogoal and pushtonongoal actions require that the agent is at l_p, which is adjacent to l_from (the stone's current position), and then the stone moves from l_from to l_to in direction d. The direction d must be a valid movement from l_p to l_from (i.e., the agent is moving towards the stone) and then from l_from to l_to (the stone is being pushed in that direction). So for example, if the agent is at pos32 (north of pos42), they can push the stone south (dirdown) to pos43? Or wait, the direction from l_p to l_from must be d. So if the agent is at pos32 and the stone is at pos42, the direction from pos32 to pos42 is dirdown. Then, pushing the stone in direction d (dirdown) would move it to pos43 (since from pos42, moving dirdown is to pos43). So the agent at pos32 can push the stone from pos42 to pos43 via dirdown.

But the goal is to get the stone to pos25, which is in row2, column5. So the stone needs to move from pos42 (4,2) to pos25 (2,5). That's up two rows and right three columns. Let's plan a path.

Possible path for the stone: pos42 → pos43 → pos44 → pos45 → pos35 → pos25? But wait, how? Let me see the movement possibilities for the stone when pushed.

The agent can push the stone in directions allowed by the movement graph. For example, from pos42, the stone can be pushed to pos43 (dirdown), pos52 (dirright?), pos32 (dirleft?), or pos41 (dirup?), depending on the agent's position.

Alternatively, let's think of the grid's movement directions. For pos42:

- You may move from pos42 to pos32 following dirleft (so dirleft from pos42 is to pos32)
- to pos52 via dirright
- to pos41 via dirup
- to pos43 via dirdown

So, to push the stone from pos42 to pos43 (dirdown), the agent needs to be at pos42's up direction (pos32?), because to push down, the agent must be north of the stone.

Wait, the direction d in the push action is the direction from the agent's location (l_p) to the stone's location (l_from). So if the agent is at pos32 (which is north of pos42), direction d is dirdown (since moving from pos32 to pos42 is dirdown). Then, pushing the stone in direction d (dirdown) would move it from pos42 to pos43. Because from pos42, moving dirdown leads to pos43.

So the agent at pos32 can push the stone from pos42 to pos43 with direction dirdown.

Similarly, if the agent is at pos52 (south of pos42), direction dirup would take them to pos42. Then, pushing the stone in dirup would move it to pos32. But that's moving north, which may not be helpful for reaching pos25.

Alternatively, moving the stone east (dirright) to pos52. But pos52 is a non-goal location. But since the final goal is to get the stone to pos25 (a goal location), we need to plan a path that eventually pushes it to pos25.

Let me outline a possible path:

Agent starts at pos55.

First, move to pos45 (left from pos55 via dirleft). Then to pos44 (left again? Let's check movement options from pos45. From pos45, possible moves: to pos35 via dirleft (dirleft from pos45?), or to pos44 via dirup? Wait, the movement from pos45 is given as:

"You may move from location pos45 to location pos35 following direction dirleft" (so dirleft from pos45 is to pos35) and "You may move from location pos45 to location pos44 following direction dirup".

Wait, but how to get from pos45 to pos44? If pos45 is row4, column5, then moving up (dirup) would take to row3, column5 (pos35?), but according to the movement given, from pos45, dirup leads to pos44. Hmm, perhaps the coordinates are different. Maybe the first digit is column and the second is row? Not sure. But given the movement directions as per the problem's list, I need to follow those.

The agent is at pos55. To reach pos42, where the stone is, the agent needs to navigate through the grid. Let's find a path from pos55 to a position adjacent to pos42.

Possible path:

pos55 → pos45 (dirleft)

From pos45, possible moves:

- dirleft to pos35

- dirup to pos44

But to reach pos42, perhaps going up to pos44, then left to pos43, then left to pos42? Wait, but pos42's adjacent locations are pos32, pos52, pos41, pos43. Wait, the agent needs to get to a position adjacent to pos42 to push it.

Alternatively, from pos45, the agent can move up to pos44 (dirup), then left to pos43 (dirleft?), then left to pos42? But the movement from pos44: "You may move from location pos44 to location pos34 following direction dirleft", "You may move from location pos44 to location pos54 following direction dirright", "You may move from location pos44 to location pos43 following direction dirup", "You may move from location pos44 to location pos45 following direction dirdown".

Wait, from pos44, moving dirup takes you to pos43. Then from pos43, moving dirup takes you to pos42? Let me check:

From pos43, possible moves: "You may move from location pos43 to location pos33 following direction dirleft", "You may move from location pos43 to location pos53 following direction dirright", "You may move from location pos43 to location pos42 following direction dirup", "You may move from location pos43 to location pos44 following direction dirdown".

So from pos43, moving dirup takes you to pos42. So if the agent is at pos43, dirup to pos42. But pos42 is where the stone is. So the agent can't move there directly because the stone is there. Wait, but the initial state says "Location pos42 is clear". Wait, the initial state says "stone1 is at location pos42", but then under "Location pos42 is clear". That seems contradictory. Wait, the initial state says:

Original state:

- "player1 is at location pos55"

- "stone1 is at location pos42"

- "Location pos42 is clear"

Wait, that can't be right. If stone1 is at pos42, then pos42 is not clear. But according to the problem statement, in the original state, "Location pos42 is clear". That must be a mistake. Or maybe "clear" refers to not having the agent. Wait, the problem says "Each position on the grid may contain either the agent, a stone or be empty." So a location is clear if it has neither the agent nor a stone. But according to the initial state, stone1 is at pos42, so pos42 should not be clear. But the problem states "Location pos42 is clear". That must be a mistake. Wait, looking back at the original state:

Looking at the original state:

Under "The original state of the world is the following":

- "player1 is at location pos55"

- "stone1 is at location pos42"

Then in the list of "Location ... is clear" includes "Location pos42 is clear" and "Location pos55 is clear".

But that's conflicting because pos55 has the agent (so not clear) and pos42 has the stone (so not clear). So this seems like an error in the problem statement. But perhaps the definition of "clear" is that a location is clear if it doesn't have a stone, but can have the agent. Or maybe "clear" means no stone. Wait, the preconditions for move action require that location l_to is clear. The move action's preconditions say (ii) location l_to is clear. So if the agent is moving to l_to, then it's allowed only if l_to is clear. But according to the problem statement, the agent is at pos55, and pos55 is clear. So maybe "clear" refers to not having a stone. That is, a location is clear if there's no stone there. The agent can be at a clear location, and moving to a location requires that there's no stone there (but the agent can be there only if moving into it, but the move action's effect is to clear the previous location and occupy the new one. Wait, the move action's effects include (ii) location l_to is no longer clear. Wait, but according to the move action's effects:

After move, agent p is at l_to, and l_from is clear. So "clear" refers to the absence of the agent. Wait, no. The problem says each position may contain the agent, a stone, or be empty. So a location is clear if it's empty (no agent, no stone). So if a location has the agent or a stone, it's not clear. Therefore, in the initial state:

- pos55 has the agent, so it's not clear. But the problem states "Location pos55 is clear". This is a contradiction. Similarly, pos42 has the stone, so it's not clear, but the problem says "Location pos42 is clear". So there must be a misunderstanding here. Wait, perhaps "clear" in the problem refers to the absence of the agent. Let's check the action preconditions.

For the move action, precondition (ii) is that location l_to is clear. But if the agent is moving to l_to, then after moving, the agent is there. So perhaps "clear" here means that the location is not occupied by the agent or a stone. So during move, the l_to must be clear (no agent or stone). So in the initial state, pos55 has the agent, so it's not clear. But the problem states "Location pos55 is clear". This is conflicting. Similarly, pos42 has a stone, so it's not clear, but the problem says it is. This suggests that the problem statement might have errors, but since we have to work with it, perhaps "clear" refers to the absence of the agent, not the stone. That is, a location is clear if the agent is not there, regardless of stones. But that would make the move action's precondition (ii) to check that the agent isn't at l_to. Then, when moving, the agent leaves l_from and occupies l_to. Stones being present would not affect movement, but according to the problem's description, each position can have the agent, a stone, or be empty. So moving to a location with a stone is impossible, as it's not clear. But in the initial state, pos42 has a stone and is considered clear, which is conflicting.

This is a critical point. Let me re-examine the problem statement's initial state:

The original state includes:

- "player1 is at location pos55"

- "stone1 is at location pos42"

Then, in the list of "Location ... is clear":

- "Location pos42 is clear"

- "Location pos55 is clear"

But according to the problem's definition, a location is clear if it has neither the agent nor a stone. Therefore, the initial state as described is inconsistent. However, since the problem provides this as the initial state, we must accept that in this scenario, "clear" is defined such that a location is clear if it doesn't have a stone. Because pos42 has a stone but is marked as clear, which contradicts that. Alternatively, perhaps "clear" means the agent is not present. So a location is clear if the agent is not there. Stones don't affect clearness. But then, the move action's precondition (ii) would require that l_to is clear (no agent), which makes sense. The stone's presence is handled in other actions.

This is possible. So "clear" refers to the absence of the agent, not stones. So a location with a stone is still considered clear if the agent is not there. That explains why pos42 is clear (agent not there) despite having a stone. Similarly, pos55 is clear (since the agent is there, but according to the problem statement, it's marked as clear. Wait, no. The problem states that in the initial state, "Location pos55 is clear". But the agent is at pos55. So this would contradict if "clear" means no agent. Therefore, this suggests that there's a mistake in the problem statement. However, given that we must proceed, perhaps we should proceed under the assumption that a location is clear if it does not have a stone. So the presence of the agent does not affect whether a location is clear. That is, "clear" refers to the absence of stones. Then, when the agent moves to a location, it's allowed as long as there's no stone there. But the problem's move action's preconditions require that the location l_to is clear (no stone), and after moving, the agent is there, but the stone's presence is separate.

This seems plausible. So, for the move action, the agent can move to a location that is clear (no stone), regardless of whether the agent is there. Wait, but the move action's effect is that the agent is no longer at l_from and is at l_to. So, the move action must be from a location where the agent is present to a location that is clear (no stone). The agent's presence doesn't affect "clear" status. So in the initial state, pos55 has the agent but is marked as clear, which would mean that "clear" refers to absence of stones. That must be the case here.

Therefore, in this problem, "clear" means that there is no stone at the location. The agent's presence does not affect the clear status. Therefore, when the move action is performed, the agent can move to any clear (no stone) location, even if another agent is there (but in this problem, there's only one agent). So the initial state:

- pos55: agent is there, but it's clear (no stone). So the move action's precondition (ii) is that l_to is clear (no stone). So the agent can move to any location without a stone.

So, pos42 has a stone, so it's not clear. But according to the problem's initial state, "Location pos42 is clear". This is a contradiction. Therefore, there's a mistake in the problem statement. However, given that the user provided the problem as is, perhaps the correct approach is to proceed with the given initial state, even if there's a contradiction. So pos42 is clear (no stone), but the problem states that stone1 is at pos42. This is conflicting. Alternatively, maybe the problem's initial state lists are correct, and the "clear" statuses are correct. So perhaps there's a mistake in the problem statement where the stone's initial location is pos42, but pos42 is clear. This is impossible, so perhaps the stone is actually at a different location. But the problem states:

Original state:

- "stone1 is at location pos42"

- "Location pos42 is clear"

This is contradictory unless "clear" refers to something else. Alternatively, perhaps the initial state has an error, and the stone is at pos42, which is not clear. But according to the problem, it's stated as clear. Therefore, there's a mistake in the problem, but we must proceed.

Assuming that "clear" refers to absence of the agent, then the initial state's "Location pos42 is clear" means the agent is not there. The stone's presence is separate. So the move action's preconditions check that the destination has no stone. But then, the stone's location is pos42, so pos42 is not clear (has a stone), but the problem says it is clear. This is confusing.

Given the confusion, perhaps the best approach is to proceed with the given information as stated, even if there's a contradiction. So, the stone is at pos42, and pos42 is considered clear. Therefore, the agent can move to pos42 if needed. But when pushing the stone, the preconditions require that the stone is at l_from. So to push the stone from pos42, the agent needs to be adjacent to pos42, and the stone must be there.

This is very confusing, but perhaps the key is to proceed with the given initial state and the action preconditions as described.

Back to planning. The agent needs to push stone1 from pos42 to pos25 (a goal location). The constraints require that pos52 is not clear at some point, which means the agent or a stone must be there. Also, when that happens, the agent must have been at pos51 before.

So, perhaps the plan is:

1. Move the agent from pos55 to pos45 (dirleft).

2. Move from pos45 to pos44 (dirup).

3. Move from pos44 to pos43 (dirup).

4. Move from pos43 to pos42 (dirup). But pos42 is where the stone is. Wait, but according to the initial state, pos42 is clear (no agent or stone?), but the stone is there. This is conflicting. However, assuming the agent can move to pos42 (since it's considered clear), but the stone is there. That would be impossible. Therefore, the initial state must have a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the stone is at pos42, and the location is not clear, but the problem says it is clear. This is a problem.

Given this contradiction, perhaps the correct initial state is that pos42 is not clear (has stone1), but the problem says it is clear. Therefore, there's a mistake, but we have to proceed. Therefore, perhaps the stone is actually at pos42, but pos42 is not clear. So the agent can't move there, and must push the stone.

Thus, to push the stone, the agent needs to be adjacent to pos42. Let's consider the possible adjacent locations.

Pos42's adjacent locations (based on movement):

- From pos42, you can move to pos32 (dirleft), pos52 (dirright), pos41 (dirup), pos43 (dirdown).

So the agent needs to be at one of these locations to push the stone.

The agent starts at pos55. To reach pos32, for example, the path would be:

pos55 → pos45 (dirleft)

pos45 → pos35 (dirleft)

pos35 → pos34 (dirup?)

Wait, checking movement from pos35: "You may move from location pos35 to location pos25 following direction dirleft", "You may move from location pos35 to location pos45 following direction dirright", "You may move from location pos35 to location pos34 following direction dirup".

So from pos35, moving dirup leads to pos34.

Then pos34 → pos33 (dirleft?)

From pos34: can move to pos24 (dirleft), pos44 (dirright), pos33 (dirup?), pos35 (dirdown).

Wait, perhaps the movement directions are not as expected, but given the complexity, let's try to find a path from pos55 to pos32.

Alternative path:

pos55 → pos54 (dirup)

pos54 → pos53 (dirup)

pos53 → pos52 (dirup)

pos52 → pos42 (dirup). But pos42 has the stone, so the agent can't move there. So instead, the agent needs to go around.

Alternatively, pos55 → pos45 (dirleft)

pos45 → pos44 (dirup)

pos44 → pos43 (dirup)

pos43 → pos42 (dirup) → but pos42 has the stone. So the agent can't move there. Therefore, the agent needs to reach pos32, pos52, pos41, or pos43 to push the stone.

Let's try to reach pos32:

pos55 → pos45 (dirleft)

pos45 → pos35 (dirleft)

pos35 → pos25 (dirleft)

pos25 is a goal location. But the agent can move through it.

Then pos25 → pos24 (dirup?)

From pos25: can move to pos15 (dirleft), pos35 (dirright), pos24 (dirup).

So pos25 → pos24 (dirup)

pos24 → pos23 (dirup)

pos23 → pos22 (dirup)

pos22 → pos12 (dirleft), pos32 (dirright), etc. This seems like a long path.

Alternatively, from pos35, the agent can move to pos34 (dirup), then pos33 (dirup), then pos32 (dirup). Let's check:

pos35 → pos34 (dirup)

pos34 → pos33 (dirup)

pos33 → pos32 (dirup)

So from pos35 to pos34 (dirup), then pos34 to pos33 (dirup), then pos33 to pos32 (dirup).

Once at pos32, the agent can push the stone from pos42 to pos43 (dirdown direction). Because:

For "pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d", the preconditions are:

- agent at l_p (pos32)

- stone s at l_from (pos42)

- l_to (pos43) is clear (no stone)

- direction d: from pos32 to pos42 is dirdown, then from pos42 to pos43 is dirdown.

But pos43 must be a goal location for pushtogoal. But pos43 is not a goal location. So we can't use pushtogoal to push to pos43. Therefore, we must use pushtonongoal.

But the final goal is to have the stone at a goal location (pos25). So the stone needs to be pushed to pos25 via non-goal locations.

Wait, but pos25 is a goal location, so the final push must be a pushtogoal action.

So the plan would involve pushing the stone through non-goal locations using pushtonongoal until it reaches a goal location, then using pushtogoal. But pos25 is the only goal location.

So the agent needs to push the stone from pos42 to pos43 (non-goal), then to pos44 (non-goal), then to pos45 (non-goal), then to pos35 (non-goal), then to pos25 (goal). Let's see:

From pos42 to pos43: pushtonongoal.

Then pos43 to pos44: pushtonongoal.

Pos44 to pos45: pushtonongoal.

Pos45 to pos35: pushtonongoal.

Pos35 to pos25: pushtogoal.

But each push requires the agent to be in the correct position.

Alternatively, after pushing the stone to pos43, the agent could move to pos44 and push to pos45, etc.

But the agent's movement after each push needs to be considered.

Let's break it down step by step.

Step 1: Move agent to pos32 to push stone1 from pos42 to pos43.

Agent's path to pos32:

pos55 → pos54 (dirup)

pos54 → pos53 (dirup)

pos53 → pos52 (dirup)

pos52 → pos42 (dirup). Wait, but pos42 has the stone, so agent can't move there. So this path is blocked.

Alternative path: pos55 → pos45 (dirleft)

pos45 → pos35 (dirleft)

pos35 → pos34 (dirup)

pos34 → pos33 (dirup)

pos33 → pos32 (dirup)

This path requires 5 moves: move 5 times.

Once at pos32, agent can perform pushtonongoal to push stone1 from pos42 to pos43 (dirdown).

Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos42 pos43 dirdown

Preconditions check:

- Agent at pos32: yes.

- stone1 at pos42: yes.

- pos43 is clear: initially, pos43 is clear.

- direction from pos32 to pos42 is dirdown: yes (according to movement, pos32 can move to pos42 via dirright? Wait, let's check.

Looking at the movement from pos32:

"You may move from location pos32 to location pos22 following direction dirleft"

"You may move from location pos32 to location pos42 following direction dirright"

"You may move from location pos32 to location pos31 following direction dirup"

"You may move from location pos32 to location pos33 following direction dirdown"

So from pos32 to pos42 is dirright. Therefore, direction d is dirright.

Wait, the direction in the push action must match the movement direction from l_p (pos32) to l_from (pos42), which is dirright. Then, the direction from l_from (pos42) to l_to (pos43) must also be dirright. But according to pos42's movement:

"You may move from location pos42 to location pos32 following direction dirleft"

"You may move from location pos42 to location pos52 following direction dirright"

"You may move from location pos42 to location pos41 following direction dirup"

"You may move from location pos42 to location pos43 following direction dirdown"

So, from pos42, moving dirright is to pos52, not pos43. Therefore, to push the stone from pos42 to pos43, the direction from l_from to l_to must be dirdown.

But the agent is at pos32, and the direction from pos32 to pos42 is dirright. Therefore, the push action would need to use dirright as the direction. Then, the stone would be pushed in dirright direction from pos42 to pos52. But pos52 is a non-goal location. That would move the stone to pos52, which satisfies the constraint that pos52 must be not clear at some point. Then, the agent must have been at pos51 before that.

Wait, the constraint says if pos52 is not clear in some state, the agent must have been at pos51 earlier. So if the agent pushes the stone to pos52, making pos52 not clear (since stone is there), then the agent must have been at pos51 before. But how? The agent is at pos32 when pushing to pos52. So this path might not satisfy that constraint.

Alternatively, if the agent moves to pos51 first, then to pos52, making pos52 not clear (agent is there), which would satisfy the constraint. But then the agent can push the stone from pos52 to pos53, etc.

This complicates things, but let's try to incorporate the constraints.

Constraint 4: pos52 must be not clear in at least one state. This can be achieved by having the agent move to pos52 or push the stone there. If we push the stone to pos52, that satisfies it. But then constraint 5 requires that before pos52 is not clear, the agent was at pos51.

So, the agent must first move to pos51, then to pos52, or push the stone to pos52 after being at pos51.

Alternatively, the agent moves to pos51, then moves to pos52 (making pos52 not clear), then continues.

But this adds steps. Let's see:

Plan steps:

1. Move from pos55 to pos54 (dirup)

2. Move from pos54 to pos53 (dirup)

3. Move from pos53 to pos52 (dirup)

4. Move from pos52 to pos51 (dirup) [Wait, from pos52, can the agent move to pos51? According to movement list: "You may move from location pos52 to location pos42 following direction dirleft", "You may move from location pos52 to location pos51 following direction dirup", "You may move from location pos52 to location pos53 following direction dirdown".

Yes, so step 3: pos53 → pos52 (dirup)

Step 4: pos52 → pos51 (dirup)

But why? Because we need to have the agent at pos51 before pos52 is not clear. If we make pos52 not clear by pushing the stone there, then before that, the agent must have been at pos51.

Alternatively, the agent can go to pos51 first, then to pos52, making pos52 not clear (agent there), which satisfies constraint 4 and 5.

But how does that help in moving the stone? It adds steps but satisfies the constraints.

So, steps to satisfy constraint 4 and 5:

- Agent moves to pos51 (from pos55, which requires moving up and left).

Path to pos51:

pos55 → pos54 (dirup)

pos54 → pos53 (dirup)

pos53 → pos52 (dirup)

pos52 → pos51 (dirup)

Now, the agent is at pos51. Then, moving to pos52 makes pos52 not clear (agent there). This satisfies constraint 4 (pos52 not clear) and constraint 5 (agent was at pos51 before).

Then, the agent can proceed to move to pos52, then perhaps push the stone from pos42 to pos52. But the stone is at pos42, so the agent needs to get from pos52 to a position adjacent to pos42 to push it.

Alternatively, after reaching pos51, the agent can move back to pos52, then pos53, etc., to get to the stone.

But this seems time-consuming. Let's see if there's a more optimal path.

Alternative approach:

The agent needs to push the stone to pos25. To do that, the stone needs to go up from pos42 to pos32, then to pos22, then to pos23, etc. But pos32 is a non-goal location. Let's consider pushing the stone up to pos32, then left to pos22, then up to pos12, then right to pos25. No, pos12 is not a goal. Alternatively, pos32 to pos22 to pos23 to pos24 to pos25. But pos25 is a goal. So the path could be pos42 → pos32 → pos22 → pos23 → pos24 → pos25.

But each push requires the agent to be in the correct position.

Let's outline this path:

1. Push stone1 from pos42 to pos32 (direction dirup). Agent is at pos42's south (pos52) to push north. Wait, no. To push from pos42 to pos32 (dirleft), the agent must be east of pos42 (pos43), and push west (dirleft). Wait, no. The direction is determined by the agent's position relative to the stone.

To push the stone from pos42 to pos32 (dirleft), the agent must be at pos42's east (pos43) and push west (dirleft). But according to movement directions, from pos43 to pos42 is dirup. Wait, this is confusing.

Alternatively, to push the stone from pos42 to pos32 (dirleft), the agent must be at pos42's east (pos43), and the direction from the agent to the stone is dirleft. Then, pushing the stone in dirleft would move it to pos32.

Wait, no. The direction in the push action must be the direction from the agent's location (l_p) to the stone's location (l_from). So if the agent is at pos43, and the stone is at pos42, the direction from pos43 to pos42 is dirup (since moving up from pos43 to pos42). Then, the stone is pushed in the same direction (dirup) from pos42 to pos41. Because from pos42, moving dirup leads to pos41. So that's not helpful.

Alternatively, the agent is at pos52 (south of pos42), direction dirup to pos42. Then, pushing the stone dirup would move it to pos32.

Wait, let's check:

From pos52, movement to pos42 is dirup. So if the agent is at pos52, and pushes the stone from pos42 dirup (which is north), the stone would move to pos32 (since from pos42, moving dirup is to pos32). So the action would be pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos52 pos42 pos32 dirup.

Preconditions:

- Agent at pos52: yes.

- Stone at pos42: yes.

- pos32 is clear: initially, yes.

- direction from pos52 to pos42 is dirup: yes.

- direction from pos42 to pos32 is dirup: yes.

- pos32 is a non-goal location: yes.

So this action is valid.

After this push, the stone is at pos32, and the agent is at pos42.

Then, the agent needs to push the stone from pos32 to pos22. To do that, the agent can be at pos42 (south of pos32) and push dirup to pos22. Wait, pos32 to pos22 is dirup. So the agent needs to be south of pos32 (i.e., pos42) to push north. So:

Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos22 dirup.

Preconditions:

- Agent at pos42: after previous push, agent is at pos42.

- Stone at pos32: yes.

- pos22 is clear: initially yes.

- direction from pos42 to pos32 is dirup: yes.

- direction from pos32 to pos22 is dirup: yes.

- pos22 is non-goal: yes.

This action is valid. After this, stone is at pos22, agent at pos32.

Next, push stone from pos22 to pos23 (dirdown? Let's see. To push the stone east to pos23, agent must be at pos22's west (pos12) and push east. But agent is at pos32. Alternatively, push the stone south to pos23.

Wait, pos22's movements:

From pos22, you can move to pos12 (dirleft), pos32 (dirright), pos21 (dirup), pos23 (dirdown).

So to push the stone from pos22 to pos23 (dirdown), the agent must be north of pos22 (pos21) and push south. But agent is at pos32. Alternatively, the agent can move to pos23 and push from there. Wait, this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, after the stone is at pos22, the agent can move to pos21 (north of pos22) and push the stone south to pos23.

But moving from pos32 to pos21 requires a path. Let's see:

Agent is at pos32 after pushing to pos22. To get to pos21, agent can move:

pos32 → pos22 (dirleft), then pos22 → pos21 (dirup).

But after pushing to pos22, the agent is at pos32. Then:

Action: move player1 pos32 pos22 dirleft.

Preconditions: agent at pos32, pos22 is clear (after stone was pushed to pos22, pos22 is not clear (stone is there). So move is not possible. Therefore, this path is invalid.

Alternative path: agent needs to find another way to reach pos21.

From pos32, possible moves:

- dirleft to pos22 (but pos22 has stone, so can't move there)

- dirright to pos42 (but pos42 is clear?)

- dirup to pos31

- dirdown to pos33.

So agent can move from pos32 to pos31 (dirup).

pos31 → pos21 (dirleft).

pos21 → pos22 (dirdown), but pos22 has stone. So agent can't move there.

Alternatively, agent can move from pos31 to pos21 (dirleft), then pos21 → pos22 (dirdown) is blocked.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe an alternative path for the stone.

Alternatively, after pushing the stone to pos32, the agent is at pos42. Then, move to pos43, pos44, etc., to push the stone east.

But the goal is to get the stone to pos25. Let's consider pushing the stone up to pos32, then left to pos22, then left to pos12, then right to pos15, then right to pos25. But pos15 is not a goal location. The final push to pos25 must be via pushtogoal.

Alternatively, after pos32, push to pos22, then to pos23, then to pos24, then to pos25.

But each step requires the agent to be in the correct position.

Let's try:

1. Push stone from pos42 to pos32: agent at pos52, dirup.

But earlier steps require the agent to reach pos52. To reach pos52, the agent needs to move from pos55 to pos54, pos53, pos52. Then, push the stone from pos42 to pos32.

But this would require the agent to be at pos52, which is after moving through pos53 and pos54. Let's outline this path:

Steps:

1. move player1 pos55 pos54 dirup

2. move player1 pos54 pos53 dirup

3. move player1 pos53 pos52 dirup

Now agent is at pos52. Then:

4. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos52 pos42 pos32 dirup

Preconditions check:

- agent at pos52: yes.

- stone at pos42: yes.

- pos32 is clear: yes.

- direction from pos52 to pos42 is dirup: according to movement, from pos52 to pos42 is dirup. Yes.

- direction from pos42 to pos32 is dirup: according to movement, pos42 to pos32 is dirleft. Wait, no. From pos42, dirup is to pos41. Dirleft is to pos32. So direction from pos42 to pos32 is dirleft.

So the direction d in the push action must be dirup (from pos52 to pos42), but the stone is pushed in the same direction (dirup) from pos42 to pos41. But we want to push to pos32. Therefore, this is not possible.

This indicates a mistake in the previous plan. The direction from the agent's position to the stone's position (dirup) must match the direction the agent is pushing. So the stone would be pushed in dirup direction from pos42 to pos41. But pos41 is a non-goal location. That's not helpful.

Alternatively, to push the stone to pos32, the agent must be at pos42's east (pos43) and push west (dirleft). So the agent needs to be at pos43 to push the stone to pos32.

But how to get the agent to pos43?

Agent is at pos55. To reach pos43:

pos55 → pos45 (dirleft)

pos45 → pos44 (dirup)

pos44 → pos43 (dirup)

Then, agent is at pos43. Then, push the stone from pos42 to pos32 (dirleft).

Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos42 pos32 dirleft

Preconditions:

- agent at pos43: yes.

- stone at pos42: yes.

- pos32 is clear: yes.

- direction from pos43 to pos42 is dirup (from movement: pos43 can move to pos42 via dirup). So direction d is dirup.

Then, pushing the stone in dirup direction from pos42 would move it to pos32? Wait, according to movement from pos42, dirup is to pos41. So this is not possible. Therefore, this approach is incorrect.

This is getting quite complex. Perhaps a different strategy is needed. Let's consider using the constraint that pos52 must be not clear, and the agent must have been at pos51 before.

So steps:

1. Move agent from pos55 to pos54 (dirup)

2. Move to pos53 (dirup)

3. Move to pos52 (dirup)

4. Move to pos51 (dirup) → now agent is at pos51, satisfying the prerequisite for pos52 being not clear.

5. Move back to pos52 (dirdown from pos51). Now pos52 is not clear (agent there), satisfying constraint 4 and 5.

6. Then, move from pos52 to pos42 (dirup) → but pos42 has the stone. Cannot move there. So instead, push the stone from pos42 to pos52.

But to push the stone from pos42 to pos52, the agent needs to be at pos42's west (pos32) or east (pos43), etc.

Alternatively, agent is at pos52 and can push the stone east to pos52's east, but the stone is at pos42, which is north of pos52. So to push the stone from pos42 to pos52, the agent must be north of pos42 (pos32) and push south. But the agent is at pos52. This is not possible.

Hmm. This seems stuck. Let's try another approach.

Given the time I've spent and the complexity, perhaps the optimal plan is as follows:

- Move the agent to pos45, then pos44, pos43, pos42 (but pos42 has the stone, so cannot move there).

Wait, but according to the initial state, pos42 is clear. Even though the stone is there, which is contradictory. Assuming the agent can move to pos42, then:

1. move player1 pos55 pos45 dirleft

2. move player1 pos45 pos44 dirup

3. move player1 pos44 pos43 dirup

4. move player1 pos43 pos42 dirup

Now agent is at pos42. Then, push the stone to pos43 (dirdown):

Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos43 dirdown

Wait, but the agent is at pos42, which is where the stone is. This is invalid.

Alternatively, the agent can push the stone from pos42 to pos43 while at pos43's north (pos33), but that requires the agent to be at pos33.

This is getting too time-consuming. Perhaps I need to look for the shortest path that satisfies all constraints.

Another idea: The stone is at pos42. The only goal location is pos25. The agent must push the stone from pos42 to pos43, then pos44, pos45, pos35, pos25.

Each push requires the agent to be in the correct position.

For example:

1. Agent moves to pos43 (north of pos42).

Then push stone from pos42 to pos43 (dirdown).

But pos43 is a non-goal, so use pushtonongoal.

Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos42 pos43 dirdown → wait, no. The stone is at pos42, and the agent is at pos43. So the direction from agent (pos43) to stone (pos42) is dirup. Then, pushing in dirup would move the stone to pos41. Not helpful.

Alternatively, agent at pos43, direction from pos43 to pos42 is dirup. Push the stone in dirup to pos41. Not helpful.

Alternatively, agent at pos52 (south of pos42), direction dirup to pos42, push stone dirup to pos32.

But then, the stone is at pos32. Then agent can push it to pos22, then to pos23, etc.

But this requires multiple steps.

Alternatively, the agent moves to pos32, then pushes the stone north to pos22.

But this would require the agent to move from pos55 to pos32, which is a long path.

Given the time constraints, I'll attempt to write a plan that satisfies the constraints and moves the stone to pos25.

Final Plan Steps:

1. Move agent from pos55 to pos54 (dirup)

2. Move to pos53 (dirup)

3. Move to pos52 (dirup)

4. Move to pos51 (dirup) → satisfies constraint 5 (if pos52 is not clear later, agent was here)

5. Move back to pos52 (dirdown) → pos52 is not clear (agent there), satisfying constraint 4

6. Move to pos42 (dirup) → but pos42 has stone, so invalid. Instead, push stone from pos42 to pos52.

Agent is at pos52. To push stone from pos42 to pos52 (dirright):

But according to movement, from pos42 to pos52 is dirright. The agent is at pos52, which is south of pos42. The direction from pos52 to pos42 is dirup. So the agent can push the stone from pos42 to pos52 with direction dirup.

Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos52 pos42 pos52 dirup.

Preconditions:

- Agent at pos52: yes.

- Stone at pos42: yes.

- pos52 is clear: after step 5, agent is there, so pos52 is not clear. Thus, this action is invalid.

Thus, cannot push to pos52. So need another approach.

Alternative idea: After step 5 (agent at pos52), move to pos42's west (pos32) to push the stone east to pos42.

But this is not helpful.

Alternatively, after step 5, the agent can move to pos53, then pos54, pos55, pos45, etc., to reach a position to push the stone.

But this is getting too long. Given the time I've spent, I'll proceed to outline a possible plan that satisfies the constraints, even if it's not the shortest.

Plan:

1. move player1 pos55 pos45 dirleft

2. move player1 pos45 pos44 dirup

3. move player1 pos44 pos43 dirup

4. move player1 pos43 pos42 dirup → invalid since pos42 has stone, but according to problem it's clear.

Assuming pos42 is clear, proceed:

5. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos43 dirdown → but stone is at pos42, not pos43. Invalid.

Alternative:

After step 3 (agent at pos43), push stone from pos42 to pos43:

Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos42 pos43 dirup.

Preconditions:

- agent at pos43: yes.

- stone at pos42: yes.

- pos43 is clear: yes.

- direction from pos43 to pos42 is dirup: yes.

- direction from pos42 to pos43 is dirdown: yes.

- pos43 is non-goal: yes.

Thus, this action is valid. After this, stone1 is at pos43, agent is at pos42.

6. Move agent from pos42 to pos43 (dirup) → pos43 now has agent and stone? No, after push, agent is at pos42 (original l_from).

Wait, after a push action, the agent moves from l_p to l_from. So after pushing from pos43 (l_p) to pos42 (l_from), the agent ends up at pos42.

So after step 5 (push), agent is at pos42, stone is at pos43.

7. Now, push stone from pos43 to pos44:

Agent needs to be at pos43's west (pos33), east (pos53), north (pos42), or south (pos44).

Agent is at pos42. To push stone from pos43 to pos44 (dirdown), agent must be at pos43's north (pos42) and push south.

Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos43 pos44 dirdown.

Preconditions:

- agent at pos42: yes.

- stone at pos43: yes.

- pos44 is clear: yes.

- direction from pos42 to pos43 is dirdown: yes.

- direction from pos43 to pos44 is dirdown: yes.

- pos44 is non-goal: yes.

Valid action. After this, stone is at pos44, agent at pos43.

8. Push stone from pos44 to pos45:

Agent at pos44's north (pos43), push south to pos45.

Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos44 pos45 dirdown.

Preconditions:

- agent at pos43: yes.

- stone at pos44: yes.

- pos45 is clear: yes.

- direction from pos43 to pos44 is dirdown: yes.

- direction from pos44 to pos45 is dirdown: yes.

Valid. Stone at pos45, agent at pos44.

9. Push stone from pos45 to pos35:

Agent at pos44, can move to pos45 (dirdown), then push north to pos35.

But direction from pos45 to pos35 is dirleft.

Wait, agent needs to be at pos45's south (pos55) to push north. Alternatively, agent at pos45's east (pos55) to push west.

Alternatively, agent at pos35 (west of pos45) to push east.

But agent is at pos44. To reach pos35:

pos44 → pos34 (dirleft)

pos34 → pos33 (dirleft)

pos33 → pos32 (dirleft)

pos32 → pos22 (dirleft)

pos22 → pos12 (dirleft)

This is too long. Alternatively, agent at pos44 can move to pos45 (dirdown).

10. move player1 pos44 pos45 dirdown.

Now agent at pos45.

11. Push stone from pos45 to pos35 (dirleft):

Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos45 pos45 pos35 dirleft → invalid, stone is at pos45.

Wait, stone is at pos45. To push it to pos35, agent must be east of pos45 (pos55) and push west (dirleft).

But agent is at pos45. So move to pos55:

12. move player1 pos45 pos55 dirright.

13. Now, push stone from pos45 to pos35:

Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos55 pos45 pos35 dirleft.

Preconditions:

- agent at pos55: yes.

- stone at pos45: yes.

- pos35 is clear: yes.

- direction from pos55 to pos45 is dirleft: yes.

- direction from pos45 to pos35 is dirleft: yes.

Valid. Stone at pos35, agent at pos45.

14. Push stone from pos35 to pos25 (pushtogoal, since pos25 is goal):

Agent needs to be at pos35's south (pos45) and push north (dirup).

Action: pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos45 pos35 pos25 dirup.

Preconditions:

- agent at pos45: yes.

- stone at pos35: yes.

- pos25 is clear: yes.

- direction from pos45 to pos35 is dirup: yes.

- direction from pos35 to pos25 is dirup: yes.

- pos25 is goal: yes.

Valid. After this, stone is at pos25 (goal), agent at pos35.

This plan satisfies the goal. Now, check the constraints:

1. pos25 not clear: achieved in the final state (stone is there).

2. If pos25 is not clear, then pos51 not clear or stone at pos11. Since pos51 is clear in the final state, but we need to ensure that pos51 was not clear at some point after. In step 4, the agent was at pos51. Wait, no. In this plan, the agent never went to pos51. Therefore, this plan violates constraint 2.

Thus, this plan is invalid. Need to revise.

To satisfy constraint 2, after pos25 is not clear (in the final state), either pos51 is not clear or stone1 is at pos11. Since stone1 is at pos25, we need to ensure pos51 is not clear at some state after pos25 becomes not clear. But the final state has the agent at pos35. So the agent must move to pos51 after pushing the stone to pos25.

So additional steps:

15. move player1 pos35 pos45 dirright.

16. move player1 pos45 pos55 dirright.

17. move player1 pos55 pos54 dirup.

18. move player1 pos54 pos53 dirup.

19. move player1 pos53 pos52 dirup.

20. move player1 pos52 pos51 dirup.

Now, pos51 is not clear (agent there), satisfying the constraint.

But this makes the plan longer. However, according to the problem statement, we need to provide an optimal plan (shortest possible).

Alternative approach: Ensure that during the plan, pos51 is visited before pos25 is not clear.

But the agent needs to push the stone to pos25 as the final step. So the agent must visit pos51 before the final push.

Let's integrate that into the plan.

Revised plan:

Steps 1-13:

... up to step 13, agent at pos55, stone at pos35.

14. move player1 pos55 pos54 dirup.

15. move player1 pos54 pos53 dirup.

16. move player1 pos53 pos52 dirup.

17. move player1 pos52 pos51 dirup.

Now agent at pos51 (satisfies constraint 5 if pos52 is not clear later).

18. move player1 pos51 pos52 dirdown. → pos52 not clear (agent there), satisfying constraint 4.

19. move player1 pos52 pos53 dirdown.

20. move player1 pos53 pos54 dirdown.

21. move player1 pos54 pos55 dirdown.

22. move player1 pos55 pos45 dirleft.

23. move player1 pos45 pos35 dirleft.

24. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos35 pos35 pos25 dirup. → invalid, stone is at pos35.

Wait, stone is at pos35. To push to pos25, agent must be south of pos35 (pos45) and push north.

So:

23. move player1 pos35 pos45 dirright.

24. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos45 pos35 pos25 dirup.

Now, stone is at pos25. Now, pos25 is not clear. Constraint 2 requires that after this, pos51 is not clear.

The agent is at pos35. To make pos51 not clear, agent must move there.

25. move player1 pos35 pos45 dirright.

26. move player1 pos45 pos55 dirright.

27. move player1 pos55 pos54 dirup.

28. move player1 pos54 pos53 dirup.

29. move player1 pos53 pos52 dirup.

30. move player1 pos52 pos51 dirup.

Now pos51 is not clear.

This plan is very long and likely not optimal.

Given the time constraints and complexity, I think the correct plan involves the agent moving to pos51 first to satisfy the constraint related to pos52, then proceeding to push the stone. However, given the time I've spent, I'll provide the best possible plan I can think of, even if it's not optimal.
