Let's analyze this Sokoban-like problem:

1. We have a 5x5 grid with positions labeled as pos(row)(column), e.g., pos11 is the top-left corner, and pos55 is the bottom-right corner.
2. player1 starts at pos55, and stone1 starts at pos42.
3. pos25 is the only goal location.
4. Our objective is to bring stone1 to a goal location (pos25).
5. We have constraints that need to be satisfied.

Let's understand the constraints:
1. "Location pos25 is not clear" must hold in at least one state. This means we need to have either the player or the stone at pos25 at some point.
2. If "Location pos25 is not clear" holds, then either "Location pos51 is not clear" or "stone1 is at location pos11" must hold in that state or a future state. This means that after occupying pos25, we must either occupy pos51 or move the stone to pos11.
3. "Location pos31 is not clear" can only hold in one continuous sequence of states. This means we can only occupy pos31 once (for potentially multiple consecutive states).
4. "Location pos52 is not clear" must hold in at least one state. This means we need to have either the player or the stone at pos52 at some point.
5. If "Location pos52 is not clear" holds, then there must be an earlier state where "player1 is at location pos51". This means that before occupying pos52, the player must have been at pos51.

Given these constraints and our objective, let's plan:

1. We need to move the player from pos55 to reach the stone at pos42.
2. We need to push the stone from pos42 to pos25 (the goal).
3. We need to satisfy the constraints.

Let's visualize the 5x5 grid (initially):
```
1 . . . . .
2 . . . . G  (G = goal at pos25)
3 . . . . .
4 . S . . .  (S = stone at pos42)
5 . . . . P  (P = player at pos55)
```

To push the stone to the goal, the player needs to be behind the stone in the direction of the push. The stone is at pos42, and the goal is at pos25. So, the stone needs to move left (to pos32) and then up (to pos22, pos12, and finally pos25).

First, I need to get the player to a position where he can push the stone. To push the stone left from pos42 to pos32, the player needs to be at pos52.

Let's create a step-by-step plan:

1. Move the player from pos55 to pos54.
2. Move the player from pos54 to pos53.
3. Move the player from pos53 to pos52.
4. Push the stone from pos42 to pos32 (player moves from pos52 to pos42).
5. Move the player from pos42 to pos41.
6. Move the player from pos41 to pos31.
7. Move the player from pos31 to pos32.
8. Push the stone from pos32 to pos22 (player moves from pos32 to pos22).
9. Move the player from pos22 to pos21.
10. Move the player from pos21 to pos11.
11. Move the player from pos11 to pos12.
12. Push the stone from pos22 to pos12 (player moves from pos12 to pos12).
13. Move the player from pos12 to pos13.
14. Push the stone from pos12 to pos13 (player moves from pos13 to pos13).
15. Move the player from pos13 to pos14.
16. Push the stone from pos13 to pos14 (player moves from pos14 to pos14).
17. Move the player from pos14 to pos15.
18. Push the stone from pos14 to pos15 (player moves from pos15 to pos15).
19. Move the player from pos15 to pos25.
20. Push the stone from pos15 to pos25 (player moves from pos25 to pos25).

Wait, I think there's an issue with my steps. Let me correct this. 

The stone is at pos42, and the goal is at pos25. To push the stone, the player needs to be on the opposite side of the direction of the push.

Let's reconsider:

1. To push the stone from pos42 to pos32 (left), the player needs to be at pos52 (to the right of the stone).
2. To push the stone from pos32 to pos22 (up), the player needs to be at pos33 (below the stone).
3. To push the stone from pos22 to pos12 (up), the player needs to be at pos23 (below the stone).
4. To push the stone from pos12 to pos13 (down), the player needs to be at pos11 (above the stone).
5. To push the stone from pos13 to pos14 (down), the player needs to be at pos12 (above the stone).
6. To push the stone from pos14 to pos15 (down), the player needs to be at pos13 (above the stone).
7. To push the stone from pos15 to pos25 (right), the player needs to be at pos14 (to the left of the stone).

But I realize that I'm not following the structure of the problem correct. Let's look at the available actions again:
- "move p l_from l_to d": Move agent p from location l_from to location l_to following direction d.
- "pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": Make agent p, situated at location l_p, push stone s from location l_from to goal location l_to, following direction d.
- "pushtonongoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": Make agent p, situated at location l_p, push stone s from location l_from to non-goal location l_to, following direction d.

The push actions have a slightly different structure than I was thinking. Let me revise.

In "pushtogoal" and "pushtonongoal", the agent p is situated at location l_p, and is pushing stone s from location l_from to location l_to. For this to work, the agent p must be in a position such that by moving in direction d, it would be at location l_from. Thus, l_p and l_from must be adjacent, and the movement from l_p to l_from must be in direction d.

Let's think through the plan again. I'll use the actions as defined:

1. "move player1 pos55 pos54 dirup": Move the player from pos55 to pos54 by moving up.
2. "move player1 pos54 pos53 dirup": Move the player from pos54 to pos53 by moving up.
3. "move player1 pos53 pos43 dirleft": Move the player from pos53 to pos43 by moving left.
4. "move player1 pos43 pos44 dirdown": Move the player from pos43 to pos44 by moving down.
5. "move player1 pos44 pos45 dirdown": Move the player from pos44 to pos45 by moving down.
6. "move player1 pos45 pos35 dirleft": Move the player from pos45 to pos35 by moving left.
7. "move player1 pos35 pos25 dirleft": Move the player from pos35 to pos25 by moving left.
8. "move player1 pos25 pos24 dirup": Move the player from pos25 to pos24 by moving up.
9. "move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup": Move the player from pos24 to pos23 by moving up.
10. "move player1 pos23 pos33 dirright": Move the player from pos23 to pos33 by moving right.
11. "move player1 pos33 pos43 dirright": Move the player from pos33 to pos43 by moving right.
12. "move player1 pos43 pos42 dirup": Move the player from pos43 to pos42 by moving up.
13. "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos42 pos32 dirleft": Push the stone from pos42 to pos32 by moving the player from pos42 to pos32 and the stone from pos42 to pos32.

Hmm, there's a problem: the player is already at the stone's position (pos42), so it can't push the stone from there. The push action requires the agent to be in an adjacent position to the stone. I think I might have misunderstood the problem or the action definitions.

Let me read the action definitions again.

"pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": 
- Agent p is at location l_p.
- Stone s is at location l_from.
- You can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d.
- You can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d.
- Location l_to is a goal location.

"pushtonongoal p s l_p l_from l_to d":
- Agent p is at location l_p.
- Stone s is at location l_from.
- You can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d.
- You can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d.
- Location l_to is not a goal location.

In both push actions, the agent and the stone are in different positions (l_p and l_from respectively), and the agent can reach the stone by moving in direction d. Then, the stone is pushed in the same direction d to location l_to.

So, for "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos52 pos42 pos32 dirleft": 
- Agent player1 is at location pos52.
- Stone stone1 is at location pos42.
- The agent can move from pos52 to pos42 in the direction dirleft.
- The stone can be pushed from pos42 to pos32 in the direction dirleft.
- Location pos32 is not a goal location.

This seems to match our understanding. Let's revise the plan:

Current state:
- player1 is at pos55
- stone1 is at pos42

Let's get the player to the right position to push the stone:

1. "move player1 pos55 pos54 dirup": Move the player from pos55 to pos54 by moving up.
2. "move player1 pos54 pos53 dirup": Move the player from pos54 to pos53 by moving up.
3. "move player1 pos53 pos52 dirup": Move the player from pos53 to pos52 by moving up.

Now, the player is at pos52 and the stone is at pos42. The player can push the stone:

4. "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos52 pos42 pos32 dirleft": Push the stone from pos42 to pos32 by moving left.

After this action, the player is at pos42 and the stone is at pos32.

Next, we want to push the stone from pos32 to pos22 (moving up):

5. "move player1 pos42 pos41 dirup": Move the player from pos42 to pos41 by moving up.
6. "move player1 pos41 pos31 dirleft": Move the player from pos41 to pos31 by moving left.
7. "move player1 pos31 pos32 dirdown": Move the player from pos31 to pos32 by moving down.

Now, the player is at pos32 and the stone is at pos32. Wait, that's wrong. The player can't be in the same position as the stone. Let me correct this.

After the pushtonongoal action, the player is at pos42 and the stone is at pos32. We need to move the player to a position where they can push the stone from pos32 to pos22 (moving up). We would want the player to be in the cell dirup from the stone, which is pos33.

Revising steps 5, 6, 7:

5. "move player1 pos42 pos43 dirdown": Move the player from pos42 to pos43 by moving down.
6. "move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft": Move the player from pos43 to pos33 by moving left.

Now, the player is at pos33 and the stone is at pos32. The player can push the stone:

7. "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos32 pos22 dirup": Push the stone from pos32 to pos22 by moving up.

After this action, the player is at pos32 and the stone is at pos22.

Now, we want to push the stone from pos22 to pos12 (moving up):

8. "move player1 pos32 pos33 dirdown": Move the player from pos32 to pos33 by moving down.
9. "move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft": Move the player from pos33 to pos23 by moving left.

Now, the player is at pos23 and the stone is at pos22. The player can push the stone:

10. "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos22 pos12 dirup": Push the stone from pos22 to pos12 by moving up.

After this action, the player is at pos22 and the stone is at pos12.

Now, we want to push the stone from pos12 to pos13 (moving down):

11. "move player1 pos22 pos21 dirup": Move the player from pos22 to pos21 by moving up.
12. "move player1 pos21 pos11 dirleft": Move the player from pos21 to pos11 by moving left.

Now, the player is at pos11 and the stone is at pos12. The player can push the stone:

13. "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos11 pos12 pos13 dirdown": Push the stone from pos12 to pos13 by moving down.

After this action, the player is at pos12 and the stone is at pos13.

Now, we want to push the stone from pos13 to pos14 (moving down):

14. "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos12 pos13 pos14 dirdown": Push the stone from pos13 to pos14 by moving down.

After this action, the player is at pos13 and the stone is at pos14.

Now, we want to push the stone from pos14 to pos15 (moving down):

15. "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos14 pos15 dirdown": Push the stone from pos14 to pos15 by moving down.

After this action, the player is at pos14 and the stone is at pos15.

Finally, we want to push the stone from pos15 to pos25 (moving right, to a goal location):

16. "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos14 pos15 pos25 dirright": Push the stone from pos15 to pos25 by moving right.

After this action, the player is at pos15 and the stone is at pos25.

Now, let's check our constraints:

1. "Location pos25 is not clear" must hold in at least one state: 
   This is satisfied, as in the final state, the stone is at pos25.

2. If "Location pos25 is not clear" holds, then either "Location pos51 is not clear" or "stone1 is at location pos11" must hold in that state or a future state:
   We need to satisfy this. The stone is at pos25 (goal), so either we need to move to pos51 or move the stone to pos11. Let's move to pos51:

17. "move player1 pos15 pos14 dirup": Move the player from pos15 to pos14 by moving up.
18. "move player1 pos14 pos13 dirup": Move the player from pos14 to pos13 by moving up.
19. "move player1 pos13 pos12 dirup": Move the player from pos13 to pos12 by moving up.
20. "move player1 pos12 pos11 dirup": Move the player from pos12 to pos11 by moving up.
21. "move player1 pos11 pos21 dirright": Move the player from pos11 to pos21 by moving right.
22. "move player1 pos21 pos31 dirright": Move the player from pos21 to pos31 by moving right.
23. "move player1 pos31 pos41 dirright": Move the player from pos31 to pos41 by moving right.
24. "move player1 pos41 pos51 dirright": Move the player from pos41 to pos51 by moving right.

3. "Location pos31 is not clear" can only hold in one continuous sequence of states:
   We move through pos31 in steps 22-23, which is a single continuous sequence. Constraint satisfied.

4. "Location pos52 is not clear" must hold in at least one state:
   We were at pos52 in step 3. Constraint satisfied.

5. If "Location pos52 is not clear" holds, then there must be an earlier state where "player1 is at location pos51":
   We're at pos52 in step 3, but we haven't been at pos51 yet. We need to modify our plan.

Let's go back to the beginning and ensure that we visit pos51 before pos52:

1. "move player1 pos55 pos45 dirleft": Move the player from pos55 to pos45 by moving left.
2. "move player1 pos45 pos35 dirleft": Move the player from pos45 to pos35 by moving left.
3. "move player1 pos35 pos25 dirleft": Move the player from pos35 to pos25 by moving left.
4. "move player1 pos25 pos15 dirleft": Move the player from pos25 to pos15 by moving left.
5. "move player1 pos15 pos14 dirup": Move the player from pos15 to pos14 by moving up.
6. "move player1 pos14 pos13 dirup": Move the player from pos14 to pos13 by moving up.
7. "move player1 pos13 pos12 dirup": Move the player from pos13 to pos12 by moving up.
8. "move player1 pos12 pos11 dirup": Move the player from pos12 to pos11 by moving up.
9. "move player1 pos11 pos21 dirright": Move the player from pos11 to pos21 by moving right.
10. "move player1 pos21 pos31 dirright": Move the player from pos21 to pos31 by moving right.
11. "move player1 pos31 pos41 dirright": Move the player from pos31 to pos41 by moving right.
12. "move player1 pos41 pos51 dirright": Move the player from pos41 to pos51 by moving right.
13. "move player1 pos51 pos52 dirdown": Move the player from pos51 to pos52 by moving down.

Now, the player is at pos52 and the stone is at pos42. The player can push the stone:

14. "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos52 pos42 pos32 dirleft": Push the stone from pos42 to pos32 by moving left.

After this action, the player is at pos42 and the stone is at pos32.

Now, we want to push the stone from pos32 to pos22 (moving up):

15. "move player1 pos42 pos43 dirdown": Move the player from pos42 to pos43 by moving down.
16. "move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft": Move the player from pos43 to pos33 by moving left.

17. "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos32 pos22 dirup": Push the stone from pos32 to pos22 by moving up.

After this action, the player is at pos32 and the stone is at pos22.

Now, we want to push the stone from pos22 to pos12 (moving up):

18. "move player1 pos32 pos33 dirdown": Move the player from pos32 to pos33 by moving down.
19. "move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft": Move the player from pos33 to pos23 by moving left.

20. "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos22 pos12 dirup": Push the stone from pos22 to pos12 by moving up.

After this action, the player is at pos22 and the stone is at pos12.

Now, we want to push the stone from pos12 to pos13 (moving down):

21. "move player1 pos22 pos21 dirup": Move the player from pos22 to pos21 by moving up.
22. "move player1 pos21 pos11 dirleft": Move the player from pos21 to pos11 by moving left.

23. "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos11 pos12 pos13 dirdown": Push the stone from pos12 to pos13 by moving down.

After this action, the player is at pos12 and the stone is at pos13.

Now, we want to push the stone from pos13 to pos14 (moving down):

24. "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos12 pos13 pos14 dirdown": Push the stone from pos13 to pos14 by moving down.

After this action, the player is at pos13 and the stone is at pos14.

Now, we want to push the stone from pos14 to pos15 (moving down):

25. "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos14 pos15 dirdown": Push the stone from pos14 to pos15 by moving down.

After this action, the player is at pos14 and the stone is at pos15.

Finally, we want to push the stone from pos15 to pos25 (moving right, to a goal location):

26. "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos14 pos15 pos25 dirright": Push the stone from pos15 to pos25 by moving right.

After this action, the player is at pos15 and the stone is at pos25.

Now, let's check our constraints again:

1. "Location pos25 is not clear" must hold in at least one state: 
   Satisfied, as the stone is at pos25 in the final state.

2. If "Location pos25 is not clear" holds, then either "Location pos51 is not clear" or "stone1 is at location pos11" must hold in that state or a future state:
   Satisfied, as we were at pos51 in step 12, and the stone is at pos25 after step 26.

3. "Location pos31 is not clear" can only hold in one continuous sequence of states:
   Satisfied, as we move through pos31 in steps 10-11, which is a single continuous sequence.

4. "Location pos52 is not clear" must hold in at least one state:
   Satisfied, as we're at pos52 in step 13.

5. If "Location pos52 is not clear" holds, then there must be an earlier state where "player1 is at location pos51":
   Satisfied, as we're at pos51 in step 12, before being at pos52 in step 13.

All constraints are satisfied. But wait, this plan is not optimal. Let me revise to find a more direct route to the goal.

Actually, let's reconsider this. The goal is to bring the stone to a goal location (pos25). 

Let's try to find a more direct route:

Current state:
- player1 is at pos55
- stone1 is at pos42
- pos25 is the goal location

1. "move player1 pos55 pos45 dirleft": Move the player from pos55 to pos45 by moving left.
2. "move player1 pos45 pos44 dirup": Move the player from pos45 to pos44 by moving up.
3. "move player1 pos44 pos43 dirup": Move the player from pos44 to pos43 by moving up.
4. "move player1 pos43 pos42 dirup": Move the player from pos43 to pos42 by moving up.

Actually, I can't push the stone from here. I need to be behind it. Let me reconsider.

To push the stone:
- If I want to push it up (from pos42 to pos32), I need to be below it (at pos43).
- If I want to push it left (from pos42 to pos41), I need to be to the right of it (at pos52).
- If I want to push it right (from pos42 to pos43), I need to be to the left of it (at pos41).
- If I want to push it down (from pos42 to pos52), I need to be above it (at pos32).

Given the path of the stone to the goal (pos42 -> pos32 -> pos33 -> pos34 -> pos35 -> pos25), I need to push it first up, then right three times, then to the goal.

Hmm, no that's not quite right. Let me think more carefully about this.

The stones is at pos42, and the goal is at pos25. I need a sequence of pushing actions to move the stone from its initial position to the goal.

Let's explore possible paths:
1. pos42 -> pos32 -> pos22 -> pos12 -> pos13 -> pos14 -> pos15 -> pos25
2. pos42 -> pos43 -> pos44 -> pos45 -> pos35 -> pos25

Path 2 seems shorter, so let's go with that. For this, we need to push the stone right three times, down once, and then left once.

Let's revise the plan:

1. "move player1 pos55 pos54 dirup": Move the player from pos55 to pos54 by moving up.
2. "move player1 pos54 pos53 dirup": Move the player from pos54 to pos53 by moving up.
3. "move player1 pos53 pos52 dirup": Move the player from pos53 to pos52 by moving up.
4. "move player1 pos52 pos51 dirup": Move the player from pos52 to pos51 by moving up.
5. "move player1 pos51 pos41 dirleft": Move the player from pos51 to pos41 by moving left.

Now, the player is at pos41 and the stone is at pos42. The player can push the stone right:

6. "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos41 pos42 pos43 dirright": Push the stone from pos42 to pos43 by moving right.

After this action, the player is at pos42 and the stone is at pos43.

7. "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos43 pos44 dirright": Push the stone from pos43 to pos44 by moving right.

After this action, the player is at pos43 and the stone is at pos44.

8. "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos44 pos45 dirright": Push the stone from pos44 to pos45 by moving right.

After this action, the player is at pos44 and the stone is at pos45.

9. "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos45 pos35 dirleft": Push the stone from pos45 to pos35 by moving left.

Actually, that doesn't work. I need to push the stone down from pos45, not left. Let me correct this:

9. "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos45 pos35 dirup": Push the stone from pos45 to pos35 by moving up.

After this action, the player is at pos45 and the stone is at pos35.

10. "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos45 pos35 pos25 dirleft": Push the stone from pos35 to pos25 by moving left.

After this action, the player is at pos35 and the stone is at pos25.

Now, let's check our constraints:

1. "Location pos25 is not clear" must hold in at least one state: 
   Satisfied, as the stone is at pos25 in the final state.

2. If "Location pos25 is not clear" holds, then either "Location pos51 is not clear" or "stone1 is at location pos11" must hold in that state or a future state:
   We were at pos51 in step 5, but we're not there anymore when the stone is at pos25. So, we need to go back to pos51 after the stone is at pos25.

11. "move player1 pos35 pos45 dirright": Move the player from pos35 to pos45 by moving right.
12. "move player1 pos45 pos55 dirright": Move the player from pos45 to pos55 by moving right.
13. "move player1 pos55 pos54 dirup": Move the player from pos55 to pos54 by moving up.
14. "move player1 pos54 pos53 dirup": Move the player from pos54 to pos53 by moving up.
15. "move player1 pos53 pos52 dirup": Move the player from pos53 to pos52 by moving up.
16. "move player1 pos52 pos51 dirup": Move the player from pos52 to pos51 by moving up.

After this, the player is at pos51 and the stone is at pos25.

3. "Location pos31 is not clear" can only hold in one continuous sequence of states:
   We haven't been at pos31 in this plan, so this constraint is satisfied.

4. "Location pos52 is not clear" must hold in at least one state:
   Satisfied, as we're at pos52 in steps 3 and 15.

5. If "Location pos52 is not clear" holds, then there must be an earlier state where "player1 is at location pos51":
   For step 3, there's no earlier state where the player is at pos51. For step 15, the player was at pos51 in step 5.

Hmm, there's an issue with constraint 5. Let me adjust the plan to ensure we visit pos51 before pos52.

Let's revise the plan again:

1. "move player1 pos55 pos54 dirup": Move the player from pos55 to pos54 by moving up.
2. "move player1 pos54 pos53 dirup": Move the player from pos54 to pos53 by moving up.
3. "move player1 pos53 pos43 dirleft": Move the player from pos53 to pos43 by moving left.
4. "move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft": Move the player from pos43 to pos33 by moving left.
5. "move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft": Move the player from pos33 to pos23 by moving left.
6. "move player1 pos23 pos13 dirleft": Move the player from pos23 to pos13 by moving left.
7. "move player1 pos13 pos12 dirup": Move the player from pos13 to pos12 by moving up.
8. "move player1 pos12 pos11 dirup": Move the player from pos12 to pos11 by moving up.
9. "move player1 pos11 pos21 dirright": Move the player from pos11 to pos21 by moving right.
10. "move player1 pos21 pos31 dirright": Move the player from pos21 to pos31 by moving right.
11. "move player1 pos31 pos41 dirright": Move the player from pos31 to pos41 by moving right.
12. "move player1 pos41 pos51 dirright": Move the player from pos41 to pos51 by moving right.
13. "move player1 pos51 pos52 dirdown": Move the player from pos51 to pos52 by moving down.

Now, the player is at pos52 and the stone is at pos42. The player can push the stone:

14. "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos52 pos42 pos32 dirleft": Push the stone from pos42 to pos32 by moving left.

After this action, the player is at pos42 and the stone is at pos32.

Now, we need to push the stone from pos32 to pos33 (moving right):

15. "move player1 pos42 pos41 dirup": Move the player from pos42 to pos41 by moving up.
16. "move player1 pos41 pos31 dirleft": Move the player from pos41 to pos31 by moving left.

17. "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos32 pos33 dirright": Push the stone from pos32 to pos33 by moving right.

After this action, the player is at pos32 and the stone is at pos33.

Now, we need to push the stone from pos33 to pos34 (moving right):

18. "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos33 pos34 dirright": Push the stone from pos33 to pos34 by moving right.

After this action, the player is at pos33 and the stone is at pos34.

Now, we need to push the stone from pos34 to pos35 (moving right):

19. "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos34 pos35 dirright": Push the stone from pos34 to pos35 by moving right.

After this action, the player is at pos34 and the stone is at pos35.

Now, we need to push the stone from pos35 to pos25 (moving down):

20. "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos35 pos25 dirleft": Push the stone from pos35 to pos25 by moving left.

After this action, the player is at pos35 and the stone is at pos25.

Now, let's check our constraints:

1. "Location pos25 is not clear" must hold in at least one state: 
   Satisfied, as the stone is at pos25 in the final state.

2. If "Location pos25 is not clear" holds, then either "Location pos51 is not clear" or "stone1 is at location pos11" must hold in that state or a future state:
   We were at pos51 in step 12, but we're not there anymore when the stone is at pos25. So, we need to go back to pos51 after the stone is at pos25.

21. "move player1 pos35 pos45 dirright": Move the player from pos35 to pos45 by moving right.
22. "move player1 pos45 pos55 dirright": Move the player from pos45 to pos55 by moving right.
23. "move player1 pos55 pos54 dirup": Move the player from pos55 to pos54 by moving up.
24. "move player1 pos54 pos53 dirup": Move the player from pos54 to pos53 by moving up.
25. "move player1 pos53 pos52 dirup": Move the player from pos53 to pos52 by moving up.
26. "move player1 pos52 pos51 dirup": Move the player from pos52 to pos51 by moving up.

After this, the player is at pos51 and the stone is at pos25.

3. "Location pos31 is not clear" can only hold in one continuous sequence of states:
   We've been at pos31 in steps 10-11 and 16, which isn't a continuous sequence. We need to adjust our plan.

Let's revise the plan once more. We'll avoid using pos31 again after using it once.

Actually, let me think. I'm making this too complex. Let's go back to the basics.

The stone is at pos42, and the goal is at pos25. The player is at pos55.

Our optimization criteria is to minimize the total number of actions.

For the first phase of the problem, the player must navigate from pos55 to a position where they can start pushing the stone towards the goal.

For the second phase of the problem, the player must push the stone to the goal, ensuring all constraints are met.

Given the stone's position (pos42) and the goal (pos25), the most direct path for the stone would be:
pos42 -> pos32 -> pos22 -> pos23 -> pos24 -> pos25.

This requires 5 pushes. For each push, the player needs to be in the right position.

1. To push from pos42 to pos32 (left), the player needs to be at pos52.
2. To push from pos32 to pos22 (up), the player needs to be at pos33.
3. To push from pos22 to pos23 (down), the player needs to be at pos21.
4. To push from pos23 to pos24 (down), the player needs to be at pos22.
5. To push from pos24 to pos25 (down), the player needs to be at pos23.

Now, the player starts from pos55. The first position they need to navigate to is pos52 to perform the first push. After that, they need to navigate to the appropriate position for each subsequent push, and also ensure all constraints are met.

Let me map out the plan:

1. From pos55, the player navigates to pos52. This can be done in multiple ways, but let's choose a direct path:
   "move player1 pos55 pos54 dirup"
   "move player1 pos54 pos53 dirup"
   "move player1 pos53 pos52 dirup"

2. Now, the player is at pos52 and the stone is at pos42. They perform the first push:
   "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos52 pos42 pos32 dirleft"

3. After the push, the player is at pos42 and the stone is at pos32. They need to navigate to pos33 for the next push:
   "move player1 pos42 pos43 dirdown"
   "move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft"

4. Now, the player is at pos33 and the stone is at pos32. They perform the second push:
   "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos32 pos22 dirup"

5. After the push, the player is at pos32 and the stone is at pos22. They need to navigate to pos21 for the next push:
   "move player1 pos32 pos31 dirleft"
   "move player1 pos31 pos21 dirleft"

6. Now, the player is at pos21 and the stone is at pos22. They perform the third push:
   "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos21 pos22 pos23 dirdown"

7. After the push, the player is at pos22 and the stone is at pos23. They need to navigate to pos22 for the next push (they're already there):

8. Now, the player is at pos22 and the stone is at pos23. They perform the fourth push:
   "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos23 pos24 dirdown"

9. After the push, the player is at pos23 and the stone is at pos24. They need to navigate to pos23 for the next push (they're already there):

10. Now, the player is at pos23 and the stone is at pos24. They perform the fifth push:
    "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos24 pos25 dirdown"

11. After the push, the player is at pos24 and the stone is at pos25 (goal). The task is achieved.

Now, let's check the constraints:

1. "Location pos25 is not clear" must hold in at least one state: 
   This is satisfied, as the stone is at pos25 in the final state.

2. If "Location pos25 is not clear" holds, then either "Location pos51 is not clear" or "stone1 is at location pos11" must hold in that state or a future state:
   We need to navigate to pos51 after the stone is at pos25.

   "move player1 pos24 pos14 dirleft"
   "move player1 pos14 pos13 dirup"
   "move player1 pos13 pos12 dirup"
   "move player1 pos12 pos11 dirup"
   "move player1 pos11 pos21 dirright"
   "move player1 pos21 pos31 dirright"
   "move player1 pos31 pos41 dirright"
   "move player1 pos41 pos51 dirright"

3. "Location pos31 is not clear" can only hold in one continuous sequence of states:
   We've been at pos31 in steps 5 and 13, which isn't a continuous sequence. We need to adjust our plan.

Let's revise the plan once more. We'll avoid using pos31 twice in non-continuous states. One way to do this is to visit pos51 before pushing the stone to the goal, and avoid using pos31 again.

Let me think again. In step #5, the player is at pos32 and the stone is at pos22. We need to navigate to pos21 for the next push. Instead of going from pos32 to pos31 to pos21, we can go from pos32 to pos22 to pos12 to pos11 to pos21.

Actually, that doesn't work either because the stone is at pos22. Let's use a different path.

From pos32, we can go to pos33, then to pos23, then to pos13, then to pos12, then to pos11, then to pos21.

Let's revise the plan:

1. "move player1 pos55 pos54 dirup"
2. "move player1 pos54 pos53 dirup"
3. "move player1 pos53 pos52 dirup"
4. "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos52 pos42 pos32 dirleft"

5. After the push, the player is at pos42 and the stone is at pos32. They need to navigate to pos33 for the next push:
   "move player1 pos42 pos43 dirdown"
   "move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft"

6. "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos32 pos22 dirup"

7. After the push, the player is at pos32 and the stone is at pos22. They need to navigate to pos21 for the next push. We can go around pos22 by first going to pos33, then to pos43, then to pos53, etc.:
   "move player1 pos32 pos33 dirdown"
   "move player1 pos33 pos43 dirright"
   "move player1 pos43 pos53 dirright"
   "move player1 pos53 pos54 dirdown"
   "move player1 pos54 pos55 dirdown"
   "move player1 pos55 pos45 dirleft"
   "move player1 pos45 pos35 dirleft"
   "move player1 pos35 pos25 dirleft"
   "move player1 pos25 pos15 dirleft"
   "move player1 pos15 pos14 dirup"
   "move player1 pos14 pos13 dirup"
   "move player1 pos13 pos12 dirup"
   "move player1 pos12 pos11 dirup"
   "move player1 pos11 pos21 dirright"

8. "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos21 pos22 pos23 dirdown"

9. "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos23 pos24 dirdown"

10. "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos24 pos25 dirdown"

11. After the push, the player is at pos24 and the stone is at pos25 (goal). The task is achieved.

12. To satisfy the constraint that after "Location pos25 is not clear" holds, either "Location pos51 is not clear" or "stone1 is at location pos11" must hold:
    "move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright"
    "move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright"
    "move player1 pos44 pos54 dirright"
    "move player1 pos54 pos53 dirup"
    "move player1 pos53 pos52 dirup"
    "move player1 pos52 pos51 dirup"

13. Now, the player is at pos51 and the stone is at pos25.

Now, let's check the constraints again:

1. "Location pos25 is not clear" must hold in at least one state: 
   This is satisfied, as the stone is at pos25 in the final state.

2. If "Location pos25 is not clear" holds, then either "Location pos51 is not clear" or "stone1 is at location pos11" must hold in that state or a future state:
   Satisfied, as the player moves to pos51 after the stone is at pos25.

3. "Location pos31 is not clear" can only hold in one continuous sequence of states:
   We didn't use pos31 in this plan. Constraint satisfied.

4. "Location pos52 is not clear" must hold in at least one state:
   Satisfied, as the player is at pos52 in steps 3 and 27.

5. If "Location pos52 is not clear" holds, then there must be an earlier state where "player1 is at location pos51":
   For step 3, there's no earlier state where the player is at pos51. For step 27, the player was at pos51 in step 26. Constraint satisfied for the second instance.

But there's still an issue with constraint 5 for the first instance of pos52. We need to ensure that the player visits pos51 before visiting pos52.

Let's revise the plan again. We'll visit pos51 first, then pos52:

1. "move player1 pos55 pos54 dirup"
2. "move player1 pos54 pos44 dirleft"
3. "move player1 pos44 pos34 dirleft"
4. "move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft"
5. "move player1 pos24 pos14 dirleft"
6. "move player1 pos14 pos13 dirup"
7. "move player1 pos13 pos12 dirup"
8. "move player1 pos12 pos11 dirup"
9. "move player1 pos11 pos21 dirright"
10. "move player1 pos21 pos31 dirright"
11. "move player1 pos31 pos41 dirright"
12. "move player1 pos41 pos51 dirright"
13. "move player1 pos51 pos52 dirdown"

Now, the player is at pos52 and the stone is at pos42. The player can push the stone:

14. "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos52 pos42 pos32 dirleft"

After the push, the player is at pos42 and the stone is at pos32. They need to navigate to pos33 for the next push:

15. "move player1 pos42 pos43 dirdown"
16. "move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft"

Now, the player is at pos33 and the stone is at pos32. They perform the second push:

17. "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos32 pos22 dirup"

After the push, the player is at pos32 and the stone is at pos22. They need to navigate to pos21 for the next push:

18. "move player1 pos32 pos33 dirdown"
19. "move player1 pos33 pos43 dirright"
20. "move player1 pos43 pos53 dirright"
21. "move player1 pos53 pos54 dirdown"
22. "move player1 pos54 pos55 dirdown"
23. "move player1 pos55 pos45 dirleft"
24. "move player1 pos45 pos35 dirleft"
25. "move player1 pos35 pos25 dirleft"
26. "move player1 pos25 pos15 dirleft"
27. "move player1 pos15 pos14 dirup"
28. "move player1 pos14 pos13 dirup"
29. "move player1 pos13 pos12 dirup"
30. "move player1 pos12 pos11 dirup"
31. "move player1 pos11 pos21 dirright"

Now, the player is at pos21 and the stone is at pos22. They perform the third push:

32. "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos21 pos22 pos23 dirdown"

After the push, the player is at pos22 and the stone is at pos23. They perform the fourth push:

33. "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos23 pos24 dirdown"

After the push, the player is at pos23 and the stone is at pos24. They perform the fifth push:

34. "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos24 pos25 dirdown"

After the push, the player is at pos24 and the stone is at pos25 (goal).

Now, we need to ensure that either "Location pos51 is not clear" or "stone1 is at location pos11" holds after "Location pos25 is not clear":

35. "move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright"
36. "move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright"
37. "move player1 pos44 pos54 dirright"
38. "move player1 pos54 pos53 dirup"
39. "move player1 pos53 pos52 dirup"
40. "move player1 pos52 pos51 dirup"

Now, the player is at pos51 and the stone is at pos25.

But now, we're reusing pos31 (in steps 10 and 11), which violates the constraint "Location pos31 is not clear can only hold in one continuous sequence of states". Let's modify steps 8-13:

8. "move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown"
9. "move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown"
10. "move player1 pos14 pos15 dirdown"
11. "move player1 pos15 pos25 dirright"
12. "move player1 pos25 pos35 dirright"
13. "move player1 pos35 pos45 dirright"
14. "move player1 pos45 pos55 dirright"
15. "move player1 pos55 pos54 dirup"
16. "move player1 pos54 pos53 dirup"
17. "move player1 pos53 pos52 dirup"
18. "move player1 pos52 pos51 dirup"

Now, the player is at pos51 and the stone is at pos42. The player can push the stone:

19. "move player1 pos51 pos52 dirdown"
20. "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos52 pos42 pos32 dirleft"

And then continue as before.

Wait, actually, let me re-think. I need to determine the most efficient path for the entire problem. We need a plan of moving the stone from pos42 to pos25, while ensuring that all constraints are satisfied. One of the key constraints is that "Location pos31 is not clear" can only hold in one continuous sequence of states. So, we need to plan a route that minimizes the number of times we visit pos31, ideally just once in a continuous sequence.

Let me plan again.

1. Player1 starts at pos55.
2. The stone is at pos42.
3. We need to push the stone to pos25 (the goal).

But, we also need to ensure:
a. We visit pos51 before pos52. (Constraint 5)
b. Location pos31 is occupied at most once in a continuous sequence. (Constraint 3)
c. Location pos25 is not clear at least once. (Constraint 1)
d. After pos25 is not clear, either pos51 is not clear or the stone is at pos11. (Constraint 2)
e. Location pos52 is not clear at least once. (Constraint 4)

Let's try to find a direct and efficient path for the stone from pos42 to pos25:
1. pos42 -> pos32 (left)
2. pos32 -> pos22 (up)
3. pos22 -> pos23 (down)
4. pos23 -> pos24 (down)
5. pos24 -> pos25 (down)

To push the stone along this path, the player needs to be on the opposite side of the push direction for each push.

Now, let's draft the plan with the constraints in mind:

1. First, the player needs to visit pos51 before pos52 (Constraint 5). So, we'll navigate to pos51 and then to pos52.
   "move player1 pos55 pos45 dirleft"
   "move player1 pos45 pos35 dirleft"
   "move player1 pos35 pos25 dirleft"
   "move player1 pos25 pos15 dirleft"
   "move player1 pos15 pos14 dirup"
   "move player1 pos14 pos13 dirup"
   "move player1 pos13 pos12 dirup"
   "move player1 pos12 pos11 dirup"
   "move player1 pos11 pos21 dirright"
   "move player1 pos21 pos31 dirright"
   "move player1 pos31 pos41 dirright"
   "move player1 pos41 pos51 dirright"
   "move player1 pos51 pos52 dirdown"

2. Now, the player can push the stone for the first time:
   "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos52 pos42 pos32 dirleft"

3. After the push, the player is at pos42 and the stone is at pos32. The player needs to navigate to a position to push the stone up:
   "move player1 pos42 pos43 dirdown"
   "move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft"

4. Now, the player pushes the stone up:
   "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos32 pos22 dirup"

5. After the push, the player is at pos32 and the stone is at pos22. The player needs to navigate to a position to push the stone down:
   "move player1 pos32 pos22 dirdown"
   "move player1 pos22 pos12 dirleft"
   "move player1 pos12 pos11 dirup"
   "move player1 pos11 pos21 dirright"

6. Now, the player pushes the stone down:
   "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos21 pos22 pos23 dirdown"

7. After the push, the player is at pos22 and the stone is at pos23. The player can push the stone down again:
   "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos23 pos24 dirdown"

8. After the push, the player is at pos23 and the stone is at pos24. The player can push the stone down to the goal:
   "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos24 pos25 dirdown"

9. After the push, the player is at pos24 and the stone is at pos25 (goal).

10. Now, to satisfy Constraint 2, we need to ensure that after pos25 is not clear, either pos51 is not clear or the stone is at pos11. Since the stone is at pos25, we'll navigate to pos51:
    "move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup"
    "move player1 pos23 pos22 dirup"
    "move player1 pos22 pos21 dirup"
    "move player1 pos21 pos31 dirright"
    "move player1 pos31 pos41 dirright"
    "move player1 pos41 pos51 dirright"

After this, the player is at pos51 and the stone is at pos25.

Now, let's check the constraints:

1. "Location pos25 is not clear" must hold in at least one state:
   Satisfied, as the stone is at pos25 in the final state.

2. If "Location pos25 is not clear" holds, then either "Location pos51 is not clear" or "stone1 is at location pos11" must hold in that state or a future state:
   Satisfied, as the player moves to pos51 after the stone is at pos25.

3. "Location pos31 is not clear" can only hold in one continuous sequence of states:
   We visit pos31 in steps 10 and 31-32, which is not a continuous sequence. We need to avoid using pos31 in steps 31-32.

I think I need to revisit my plan. The constraint about pos31 being occupied in only one continuous sequence is a significant constraint. I should plan a path that minimizes the use of pos31.

Wait, let's try another path.

Actually, I think there's a simpler path for the stone.
- start: stone is at pos42
- pos42 -> pos43 (right)
- pos43 -> pos44 (right)
- pos44 -> pos45 (right)
- pos45 -> pos35 (up)
- pos35 -> pos25 (left) (goal)

However, this path might still require using pos31 twice. Let me think…

Actually, based on the constraints, I think I should visit pos51 before pushing the stone, and then avoid using pos31 until the stone is at the goal. After the stone is at the goal, I can revisit pos31 while navigating to pos51.

Let's try this:

1. First, the player navigates to pos51:
   "move player1 pos55 pos45 dirleft"
   "move player1 pos45 pos35 dirleft"
   "move player1 pos35 pos25 dirleft"
   "move player1 pos25 pos15 dirleft"
   "move player1 pos15 pos14 dirup"
   "move player1 pos14 pos13 dirup"
   "move player1 pos13 pos12 dirup"
   "move player1 pos12 pos11 dirup"
   "move player1 pos11 pos21 dirright"
   "move player1 pos21 pos31 dirright"
   "move player1 pos31 pos41 dirright"
   "move player1 pos41 pos51 dirright"

After this, the player is at pos51 and the stone is still at pos42.

Now, the player needs to navigate to a position to push the stone right (from pos42 to pos43). This would be pos41:

13. "move player1 pos51 pos41 dirleft"

14. Now, the player can push the stone right:
    "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos41 pos42 pos43 dirright"

15. After the push, the player is at pos42 and the stone is at pos43. The player can push the stone right again:
    "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos43 pos44 dirright"

16. After the push, the player is at pos43 and the stone is at pos44. The player can push the stone right again:
    "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos44 pos45 dirright"

17. After the push, the player is at pos44 and the stone is at pos45. The player can push the stone up:
    "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos45 pos35 dirup"

18. After the push, the player is at pos45 and the stone is at pos35. The player can push the stone left to the goal:
    "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos45 pos35 pos25 dirleft"

19. After the push, the player is at pos35 and the stone is at pos25 (goal).

20. Now, to satisfy Constraint 2, we need to ensure that after pos25 is not clear, either pos51 is not clear or the stone is at pos11. Since the stone is at pos25, we'll navigate to pos51:
    "move player1 pos35 pos45 dirright"
    "move player1 pos45 pos55 dirright"
    "move player1 pos55 pos54 dirup"
    "move player1 pos54 pos53 dirup"
    "move player1 pos53 pos52 dirup"
    "move player1 pos52 pos51 dirup"

After this, the player is at pos51 and the stone is at pos25.

Now, let's check the constraints:

1. "Location pos25 is not clear" must hold in at least one state:
   Satisfied, as the stone is at pos25 in the final state.

2. If "Location pos25 is not clear" holds, then either "Location pos51 is not clear" or "stone1 is at location pos11" must hold in that state or a future state:
   Satisfied, as the player moves to pos51 after the stone is at pos25.

3. "Location pos31 is not clear" can only hold in one continuous sequence of states:
   We visit pos31 in steps 10 and 11, which is a continuous sequence. Constraint satisfied.

4. "Location pos52 is not clear" must hold in at least one state:
   Satisfied, as the player is at pos52 in step 25.

5. If "Location pos52 is not clear" holds, then there must be an earlier state where "player1 is at location pos51":
   Satisfied, as the player was at pos51 in step 12, before being at pos52 in step 25.

All constraints are satisfied. The plan is optimal, with 26 steps in total.

Wait, there's one constraint I haven't fully addressed yet. I need to ensure that "Location pos52 is not clear" in at least one state. Let me navigate to pos52 after visiting pos51:

13. "move player1 pos51 pos52 dirdown"
14. "move player1 pos52 pos42 dirleft"
15. "move player1 pos42 pos41 dirup"

Now, the player is at pos41 and the stone is at pos42. The player can push the stone right:

16. "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos41 pos42 pos43 dirright"

And then continue with the rest of the plan. The total would still be 29 steps, including the extra detour to pos52.

Actually, let me think about this completely differently, focusing on the constraints.

1. We need to visit pos51 before pos52.
2. We need to occupy pos31 in at most one continuous sequence.
3. We need to have pos25 not clear at least once.
4. After pos25 is not clear, either pos51 is not clear or the stone is at pos11.
5. We need to have pos52 not clear at least once.

Given these constraints, let's try to find the most efficient path:

1. We start with the player at pos55 and the stone at pos42.
2. Let's first navigate to pos51:
   "move player1 pos55 pos54 dirup"
   "move player1 pos54 pos53 dirup"
   "move player1 pos53 pos43 dirleft"
   "move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft"
   "move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft"
   "move player1 pos23 pos13 dirleft"
   "move player1 pos13 pos12 dirup"
   "move player1 pos12 pos11 dirup"
   "move player1 pos11 pos21 dirright"
   "move player1 pos21 pos31 dirright"
   "move player1 pos31 pos41 dirright"
   "move player1 pos41 pos51 dirright"

3. Then, navigate to pos52 (to satisfy constraint 5):
   "move player1 pos51 pos52 dirdown"

4. From there, push the stone from pos42 to pos43 (right):
   "move player1 pos52 pos42 dirleft"
   "move player1 pos42 pos41 dirup"
   "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos41 pos42 pos43 dirright"

5. Push the stone from pos43 to pos44 (right):
   "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos43 pos44 dirright"

6. Push the stone from pos44 to pos45 (right):
   "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos44 pos45 dirright"

7. Push the stone from pos45 to pos35 (up):
   "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos45 pos35 dirup"

8. Push the stone from pos35 to pos25 (left, goal):
   "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos45 pos35 pos25 dirleft"

9. Now, to satisfy constraint 2, we need to ensure that after pos25 is not clear, either pos51 is not clear or the stone is at pos11. Since the stone is at pos25, we'll navigate to pos51:
   "move player1 pos35 pos45 dirright"
   "move player1 pos45 pos55 dirright"
   "move player1 pos55 pos54 dirup"
   "move player1 pos54 pos53 dirup"
   "move player1 pos53 pos52 dirup"
   "move player1 pos52 pos51 dirup"

Now, let's check the constraints again:

1. "Location pos25 is not clear" must hold in at least one state:
   Satisfied, as the stone is at pos25 in the final state.

2. If "Location pos25 is not clear" holds, then either "Location pos51 is not clear" or "stone1 is at location pos11" must hold in that state or a future state:
   Satisfied, as the player moves to pos51 after the stone is at pos25.

3. "Location pos31 is not clear" can only hold in one continuous sequence of states:
   We visit pos31 in steps 10 and 11, which is a continuous sequence. Constraint satisfied.

4. "Location pos52 is not clear" must hold in at least one state:
   Satisfied, as the player is at pos52 in steps 13 and 25.

5. If "Location pos52 is not clear" holds, then there must be an earlier state where "player1 is at location pos51":
   Satisfied, as the player was at pos51 in step 12 before being at pos52 in step 13, and at pos51 in step 24 before being at pos52 in step 25.

All constraints are satisfied, and the plan is 26 steps in total. I think this is optimal.

Actually, wait, I'm making a mistake in my pushtonongoal actions. Let's correct this.

For "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos41 pos42 pos43 dirright", the player needs to be to the left of the stone, pushing it to the right. This means the player needs to be at pos41, the stone at pos42, and we're pushing it to pos43, which is correct.

But for "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos43 pos44 dirright", the player needs to be at pos42, the stone at pos43, and we're pushing it to pos44. This is correct.

For "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos44 pos45 dirright", the player needs to be at pos43, the stone at pos44, and we're pushing it to pos45. This is correct.

For "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos45 pos35 dirup", the player needs to be below the stone, pushing it upwards. This means the player needs to be at pos55, the stone at pos45, and we're pushing it to pos35. But the player is at pos44, not pos55. This doesn't work. Let me correct this.

Actually, wait a minute. I need to be careful about the direction parameter in the push actions. The directions are dirdown, dirleft, dirright, and dirup. Let me reconsider this.

Let's interpret the action:
"pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos45 pos35 dirup"

This means player1, situated at pos44, pushes stone1 from pos45 to pos35, following direction dirup. For this to work, the player must be able to get from pos44 to pos45 following direction dirup, and from pos45 to pos35 following direction dirup.

But there's a problem: you can't go from pos44 to pos45 following direction dirup. According to the problem statement, you can go from pos44 to pos45 following direction dirdown. So, this action doesn't make sense.

Let's re-interpret the action descriptions:

"pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d" means agent p, situated at location l_p, pushes stone s from location l_from to goal location l_to, following direction d.

The preconditions include:
- You can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d.
- You can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d.

So, the direction d indicates the direction of the push. For the push action, the agent, stone, and the target location need to be in a straight line in the direction d.

But there's still some confusion since in order to push something "up", one needs to be "below" it and move "up". But I can't move from below to above in the direction "dirup", I would move in the direction "dirdown".

Hmm, let me re-read the action descriptions.

"move p l_from l_to d": Move agent p from location l_from to location l_to following direction d.

"pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": Make agent p, situated at location l_p, push stone s from location l_from to goal location l_to, following direction d.

"pushtonongoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": Make agent p, situated at location l_p, push stone s from location l_from to non-goal location l_to, following direction d.

The preconditions for the push actions:
- Agent p is at location l_p.
- Stone s is at location l_from.
- You can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d.
- You can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d.

I think d indicates the direction of the agent's movement. For a push action, the agent moves in direction d from l_p to l_from, and the stone moves in the same direction d from l_from to l_to. 

Ah, I think I understand now. The direction d is the direction in which the push action takes place. The agent moves from l_p to l_from in direction d, and the stone moves from l_from to l_to in the same direction d.

So, for "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos45 pos35 dirup", player1 is at pos44, stone1 is at pos45, and we want to push the stone to pos35. For this to work, the player must be able to move from pos44 to pos45 in direction dirup, and from pos45 to pos35 in direction dirup.

But that's not true. In the given movement permissions in the problem statement one cannot move from pos44 to pos45 in direction dirup and from pos45 to pos35 in direction dirup.

So, my current plan is invalid. Let me revise.

Ok, upon further consideration, I'm pretty sure we can push the stone from its initial position at pos42 to pos25 through the following path:
pos42 -> pos32 (left) -> pos22 (up) -> pos23 (down) -> pos24 (down) -> pos25 (down)

Now, for the push actions, the direction must match the permitted movements.

Let's revise the plan:

1. First, I need to navigate to pos51 (for constraint 5):
   "move player1 pos55 pos54 dirup"
   "move player1 pos54 pos53 dirup"
   "move player1 pos53 pos43 dirleft"
   "move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft"
   "move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft"
   "move player1 pos23 pos13 dirleft"
   "move player1 pos13 pos12 dirup"
   "move player1 pos12 pos11 dirup"
   "move player1 pos11 pos21 dirright"
   "move player1 pos21 pos31 dirright"
   "move player1 pos31 pos41 dirright"
   "move player1 pos41 pos51 dirright"

2. Then, navigate to pos52 (for constraint 5):
   "move player1 pos51 pos52 dirdown"

3. From there, I need to position the player to push the stone from pos42 to pos32 (left). The player needs to be to the right of the stone, so that's pos52. The player is already at pos52, so I can push the stone:
   "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos52 pos42 pos32 dirleft"

After this action, the player is at pos42 and the stone is at pos32.

4. Now, I need to position the player to push the stone from pos32 to pos22 (up). The player needs to be below the stone, so that's pos33. Let me navigate there:
   "move player1 pos42 pos43 dirdown"
   "move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft"

Now, the player is at pos33 and the stone is at pos32. The player can push the stone up:
"pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos32 pos22 dirup"

After this action, the player is at pos32 and the stone is at pos22.

5. Now, I need to position the player to push the stone from pos22 to pos23 (down). The player needs to be above the stone, so that's pos21. Let me navigate there avoiding pos31 (since I've already used it):
   "move player1 pos32 pos33 dirdown"
   "move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft"
   "move player1 pos23 pos13 dirleft"
   "move player1 pos13 pos12 dirup"
   "move player1 pos12 pos11 dirup"
   "move player1 pos11 pos21 dirright"

Now, the player is at pos21 and the stone is at pos22. The player can push the stone down:
"pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos21 pos22 pos23 dirdown"

After this action, the player is at pos22 and the stone is at pos23.

6. Now, I need to position the player to push the stone from pos23 to pos24 (down). The player needs to be above the stone, so that's pos22. The player is already at pos22, so I can push the stone down:
   "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos23 pos24 dirdown"

After this action, the player is at pos23 and the stone is at pos24.

7. Now, I need to position the player to push the stone from pos24 to pos25 (down). The player needs to be above the stone, so that's pos23. The player is already at pos23, so I can push the stone down to the goal:
   "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos24 pos25 dirdown"

After this action, the player is at pos24 and the stone is at pos25 (goal).

8. Now, to satisfy constraint 2, I need to ensure that after pos25 is not clear, either pos51 is not clear or the stone is at pos11. Since the stone is at pos25, I'll navigate to pos51 (careful to avoid pos31):
   "move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright"
   "move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright"
   "move player1 pos44 pos54 dirright"
   "move player1 pos54 pos53 dirup"
   "move player1 pos53 pos52 dirup"
   "move player1 pos52 pos51 dirup"

After this, the player is at pos51 and the stone is at pos25.

Now, let's check the constraints again:

1. "Location pos25 is not clear" must hold in at least one state:
   Satisfied, as the stone is at pos25 in the final state.

2. If "Location pos25 is not clear" holds, then either "Location pos51 is not clear" or "stone1 is at location pos11" must hold in that state or a future state:
   Satisfied, as the player moves to pos51 after the stone is at pos25.

3. "Location pos31 is not clear" can only hold in one continuous sequence of states:
   We visit pos31 in steps 10 and 11, which is a continuous sequence. Constraint satisfied.

4. "Location pos52 is not clear" must hold in at least one state:
   Satisfied, as the player is at pos52 in steps 13 and 30.

5. If "Location pos52 is not clear" holds, then there must be an earlier state where "player1 is at location pos51":
   Satisfied, as the player was at pos51 in step 12 before being at pos52 in step 13, and at pos51 in step 29 before being at pos52 in step 30.

All constraints are satisfied. The plan is 31 steps in total.

Hmm, there might be a more efficient path. Let me consider other paths for the stone to reach the goal:

pos42 -> pos43 (right) -> pos44 (right) -> pos34 (up) -> pos24 (up) -> pos25 (down)

This would require 5 pushes, which is the same as the previous path. Let me check if it's more efficient overall.

Let's revise:

1. First, navigate to pos51:
   "move player1 pos55 pos54 dirup"
   "move player1 pos54 pos53 dirup"
   "move player1 pos53 pos43 dirleft"
   "move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft"
   "move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft"
   "move player1 pos23 pos13 dirleft"
   "move player1 pos13 pos12 dirup"
   "move player1 pos12 pos11 dirup"
   "move player1 pos11 pos21 dirright"
   "move player1 pos21 pos31 dirright"
   "move player1 pos31 pos41 dirright"
   "move player1 pos41 pos51 dirright"

2. Then, navigate to pos52 (for constraint 5):
   "move player1 pos51 pos52 dirdown"

3. Now, position the player to push the stone from pos42 to pos43 (right). The player needs to be to the left of the stone, so that's pos41. Let's navigate there:
   "move player1 pos52 pos51 dirup"
   "move player1 pos51 pos41 dirleft"

Now, the player is at pos41 and the stone is at pos42. The player can push the stone right:
"pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos41 pos42 pos43 dirright"

After this action, the player is at pos42 and the stone is at pos43.

4. Now, position the player to push the stone from pos43 to pos44 (right). The player needs to be to the left of the stone, so that's pos42. The player is already at pos42, so I can push the stone right:
   "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos43 pos44 dirright"

After this action, the player is at pos43 and the stone is at pos44.

5. Now, position the player to push the stone from pos44 to pos34 (up). The player needs to be below the stone, so that's pos45. Let's navigate there:
   "move player1 pos43 pos44 dirdown"
   "move player1 pos44 pos45 dirdown"

Now, the player is at pos45 and the stone is at pos44. The player can push the stone up:
"pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos45 pos44 pos34 dirup"

After this action, the player is at pos44 and the stone is at pos34.

6. Now, position the player to
