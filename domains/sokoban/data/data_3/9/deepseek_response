The plan starts by moving the agent to pos44 to satisfy the constraint that pos35 must have an earlier visit to pos44. The agent then moves through pos34 to pos35 to fulfill the "pos35 not clear" constraint. Next, the agent navigates to pos22 to push the stone from pos32 to pos33. After repositioning, the stone is pushed via pos43 to the goal pos53. All constraints are respected: pos52 remains clear, pos41 is never visited, and the required state at pos35 is achieved after visiting pos44.
