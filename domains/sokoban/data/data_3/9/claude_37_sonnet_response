Let me analyze the problem step by step. We're dealing with a Sokoban-like problem on a 5x5 grid where:
- We have a player (player1) who can move around and push stones
- We have a stone (stone1) initially at pos32
- The goal is to get stone1 to a goal location (pos53 is the only goal location)
- We have several constraints:
  1. At some point, pos35 must not be clear (something needs to be there)
  2. If pos35 is not clear at some point, then player1 must have been at pos44 before that
  3. Player1 must never be at pos41
  4. Pos52 must always be clear

Let's visualize the initial grid:
```
   1 2 3 4 5
  ---------
1| . . . . .
2| . . . . .
3| . S . . .  (S = stone1)
4| . . . . P  (P = player1)
5| . . G . .  (G = goal at pos53)
```

The goal is to move the stone from pos32 to pos53 (the goal location).

Let's think about how to approach this. To push the stone to the goal, the player needs to be in the right position. We need to:
1. Move the player to a position adjacent to the stone
2. Push the stone in the direction of the goal

The stone is at pos32, and the goal is at pos53. So we need to push the stone down and to the right.

Let's think about the constraints:
- We need to ensure pos35 is not clear at some point. This could be done by moving the player or the stone there.
- Before that, player1 needs to be at pos44.
- Player1 must never be at pos41.
- pos52 must always be clear (we must never push the stone there or move the player there).

Let's start planning:

1. Current state: Player at pos45, stone at pos32, goal at pos53
2. We need to get the player to a position where they can push the stone towards the goal
3. The shortest path seems to be to move the player from pos45 to pos33 to push the stone from pos32 to pos42 (down)
4. Then the player would be at pos32, and the stone at pos42
5. Next, we need to get the player to pos43 to push the stone from pos42 to pos52, but we can't because pos52 must remain clear
6. We could instead push the stone to pos43
7. Then the player would be at pos42, and the stone at pos43
8. Next, we need to get the player to pos44 to push the stone from pos43 to pos53 (the goal)

But we also need to make sure pos35 is not clear at some point, and before that, the player needs to be at pos44. This suggests:
- After getting the stone to pos43, we should move the player to pos44
- Then move the player to pos35 (making pos35 not clear)
- Then move back to pos44 to push the stone to the goal

Let's trace through this step by step:

1. Player at pos45, stone at pos32
2. Move player from pos45 to pos44 (dirup)
3. Move player from pos44 to pos34 (dirleft)
4. Move player from pos34 to pos33 (dirup)
5. Push stone from pos32 to pos42 (dirright) - player ends at pos32, stone at pos42
6. Move player from pos32 to pos33 (dirdown)
7. Move player from pos33 to pos43 (dirright)
8. Push stone from pos42 to pos43 (dirdown) - player ends at pos42, stone at pos43
9. Move player from pos42 to pos43 (dirdown)
10. Move player from pos43 to pos44 (dirdown) - now player is at pos44 (satisfying the constraint that the player must be at pos44 before pos35 is not clear)
11. Move player from pos44 to pos34 (dirleft)
12. Move player from pos34 to pos35 (dirdown) - now pos35 is not clear (satisfying the constraint that pos35 must not be clear at some point)
13. Move player from pos35 to pos34 (dirup)
14. Move player from pos34 to pos44 (dirright)
15. Move player from pos44 to pos43 (dirup)
16. Push stone from pos43 to pos53 (dirright) - player ends at pos43, stone at pos53 (goal)

But wait, there's a problem. If the player is at pos43 and the stone is at pos43, they can't be at the same location. Let me re-think the steps more carefully.

Let's revise the path:

1. Player at pos45, stone at pos32
2. Move player from pos45 to pos44 (dirup)
3. Move player from pos44 to pos34 (dirleft)
4. Move player from pos34 to pos33 (dirup)
5. Move player from pos33 to pos23 (dirleft)
6. Move player from pos23 to pos22 (dirup)
7. Move player from pos22 to pos32 (dirright) - now the player is west of the stone
8. Push stone from pos32 to pos33 (dirdown) - player ends at pos32, stone at pos33
9. Move player from pos32 to pos33 (dirdown) - now the player is north of the stone
10. Push stone from pos33 to pos43 (dirright) - player ends at pos33, stone at pos43
11. Move player from pos33 to pos34 (dirdown)
12. Move player from pos34 to pos44 (dirright) - now player is at pos44 (satisfying the constraint that the player must be at pos44 before pos35 is not clear)
13. Move player from pos44 to pos34 (dirleft)
14. Move player from pos34 to pos35 (dirdown) - now pos35 is not clear (satisfying the constraint that pos35 must not be clear at some point)
15. Move player from pos35 to pos34 (dirup)
16. Move player from pos34 to pos44 (dirright)
17. Move player from pos44 to pos43 (dirup) - now the player is west of the stone
18. Push stone from pos43 to pos53 (dirright) - player ends at pos43, stone at pos53 (goal)

Actually, I'm still making an error with the directions. Let me explain what's going on in the grid.

The grid coordinates are (row, column) starting from the top left. So pos11 is the top-left corner, and pos55 is the bottom-right corner.

Let me re-visualize the grid and correct the directions:
```
   1 2 3 4 5
  ---------
1| . . . . .
2| . . . . .
3| . S . . .  (S = stone1 at pos32)
4| . . . . P  (P = player1 at pos45)
5| . . G . .  (G = goal at pos53)
```

The directions in this domain are:
- dirup: move up (decrease row)
- dirdown: move down (increase row)
- dirleft: move left (decrease column)
- dirright: move right (increase column)

Now let's re-plan:

1. Player at pos45, stone at pos32
2. Move player from pos45 to pos35 (dirleft)
3. Move player from pos35 to pos34 (dirup)
4. Move player from pos34 to pos33 (dirup)
5. Move player from pos33 to pos32 (dirup) - now player is at the same position as the stone, which is not valid

Let me check the initial state again to make sure I have the stone's position correct: "stone1 is at location pos32"

The player is at pos45 and the stone is at pos32. Let me revise the plan.

Actually, the stone and player are at different locations. I think the issue is that when I pushed the stone, I didn't update the stone's position correctly. Let me try once more:

1. Player at pos45, stone at pos32
2. Move player from pos45 to pos35 (dirleft)
3. Move player from pos35 to pos34 (dirup)
4. Move player from pos34 to pos33 (dirup)
5. Move player from pos33 to pos23 (dirleft)
6. Move player from pos23 to pos22 (dirup)
7. Move player from pos22 to pos32 (dirright) - now player is west of the stone, which isn't right since the stone is at pos32.

I'm getting confused with the grid visualization. Let's double-check the initial state to make sure I have the player and stone positions correct.

Player is at pos45:
```
45 = (4, 5) = 4th row, 5th column
```

Stone is at pos32:
```
32 = (3, 2) = 3rd row, 2nd column
```

Now let me visualize the grid correctly:
```
   1 2 3 4 5
  ---------
1| . . . . .
2| . . . . .
3| . S . . .  (S = stone1 at pos32)
4| . . . . P  (P = player1 at pos45)
5| . . G . .  (G = goal at pos53)
```

Let me check if "pos32" has a stone at it by looking at the initial state. 

The original state says: "stone1 is at location pos32" and "Location pos32 is clear"

There seems to be a contradiction since a location can't be both occupied by a stone and clear. 

Let me double-check the original state of the world provided:
```
"player1 is at location pos45"
"stone1 is at location pos32"
"Location pos11 is clear"
...
"Location pos32 is clear"
"Location pos45 is clear"
```

So both the player's location and the stone's location are described as "clear". I think this is a mistake in the problem description.

Since the description says "Each position on the grid may contain either the agent, a stone or be empty", I'll assume that the initial state means:
- player1 is at pos45
- stone1 is at pos32
- Both of these locations are occupied (not clear)

Now, let's plan the solution:

1. Player at pos45, stone at pos32
2. Move player from pos45 to pos35 (dirleft)
3. Move player from pos35 to pos34 (dirup)
4. Move player from pos34 to pos33 (dirup)
5. Move player from pos33 to pos23 (dirleft)
6. Move player from pos23 to pos22 (dirup)
7. Move player from pos22 to pos21 (dirleft)
8. Move player from pos21 to pos31 (dirright)
9. Move player from pos31 to pos32 (dirdown) - This is not valid since the stone is at pos32

Wait, I'm confused again. If the stone is at pos32, the player can't move to pos32. 

Maybe the "Location pos32 is clear" and "Location pos45 is clear" in the initial state are errors. Let me double-check the actions.

The move action says: "You may only perform this action if (i) agent p is at location l_from, (ii) location l_to is clear, and (iii) you can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d."

This means the player can move to a location only if it's clear. Since the stone is at pos32, the player can't move to pos32 directly. Instead, they would need to push the stone.

I notice that the push actions require the agent to be at one location, and the stone to be at another:
```
"pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": You may only perform this action if (i) agent p is at location l_p, (ii) stone s is at location l_from, (iii) location l_to is clear, (iv) you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d, (v) you can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d, and (vi) location l_to is a goal location.
```

This means l_p is the agent's location, l_from is the stone's location, and l_to is where the stone will move to.

Let me plan again:

1. Player at pos45, stone at pos32
2. Move player to pos44 (player1 pos45 pos44 dirup)
3. Move player to pos43 (player1 pos44 pos43 dirup)
4. Move player to pos33 (player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft)
5. Move player to pos23 (player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft)
6. Move player to pos22 (player1 pos23 pos22 dirup)
7. Move player to pos21 (player1 pos22 pos21 dirleft)
8. Move player to pos31 (player1 pos21 pos31 dirright)
9. From pos31, push stone at pos32 to pos33 (player1 stone1 pos31 pos32 pos33 dirdown)
10. Now player is at pos32, stone is at pos33
11. Move player to pos33 (player1 pos32 pos33 dirdown)
12. From pos33, push stone at pos33 to pos43 (player1 stone1 pos33 pos33 pos43 dirright)
13. Now player is at pos33, stone is at pos43
14. Move player to pos43 (player1 pos33 pos43 dirright)
15. From pos43, push stone at pos43 to pos53 (player1 stone1 pos43 pos43 pos53 dirright)
16. Now player is at pos43, stone is at pos53 (goal)

Wait, there's still something wrong with my push actions. I can't have the player and the stone at the same location. Let me double-check the push action:

```
"pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": You may only perform this action if (i) agent p is at location l_p, (ii) stone s is at location l_from, (iii) location l_to is clear, (iv) you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d, (v) you can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d, and (vi) location l_to is a goal location.
```

For this action, player p is at location l_p, and stone s is at location l_from.

So in step 12, where both the player and stone are at pos33, it doesn't make sense to push the stone from there.

The correct way to push would be:
- Player p is at location l_p (adjacent to the stone)
- Stone s is at location l_from
- Location l_to is clear and adjacent to l_from in direction d
- You can get from l_p to l_from following direction d (i.e., the player is aligned with the stone and the target)

Let's try again:

1. Player at pos45, stone at pos32
2. Move player1 from pos45 to pos44 (player1 pos45 pos44 dirup)
3. Move player1 from pos44 to pos43 (player1 pos44 pos43 dirup)
4. Move player1 from pos43 to pos33 (player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft)
5. Move player1 from pos33 to pos23 (player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft)
6. Move player1 from pos23 to pos22 (player1 pos23 pos22 dirup)
7. Move player1 from pos22 to pos21 (player1 pos22 pos21 dirleft)
8. Move player1 from pos21 to pos31 (player1 pos21 pos31 dirright)

At this point, the player is at pos31 and the stone is at pos32. The player is to the left of the stone. Let's use the pushtonongoal action to push it to the right:
9. Push stone1 from pos32 to pos33 (pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos32 pos33 dirright)
   - Player is now at pos32, stone is at pos33

Now, the player is to the left of the stone again. Let's continue pushing it to the right:
10. Push stone1 from pos33 to pos34 (pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos33 pos34 dirright)
    - Player is now at pos33, stone is at pos34

11. Push stone1 from pos34 to pos35 (pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos34 pos35 dirright)
    - Player is now at pos34, stone is at pos35

Now the stone is at pos35. This satisfies the constraint that pos35 must not be clear at some point.

But there's another constraint: if pos35 is not clear, the player must have been at pos44 earlier. Let me check if the player has been at pos44 in our plan so far. Yes, the player was at pos44 in step 2, before pos35 became not clear in step 11.

Now let's continue to move the stone to the goal:
12. Push stone1 from pos35 to pos45 (pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos35 pos45 dirdown)
    - Player is now at pos35, stone is at pos45

13. Move player1 from pos35 to pos45 (player1 pos35 pos45 dirright)
    - This is wrong, because the stone is already at pos45. Let me revise.

13. Move player1 from pos35 to pos25 (player1 pos35 pos25 dirleft)
14. Move player1 from pos25 to pos24 (player1 pos25 pos24 dirup)
15. Move player1 from pos24 to pos34 (player1 pos24 pos34 dirright)
16. Move player1 from pos34 to pos44 (player1 pos34 pos44 dirright)
17. Move player1 from pos44 to pos45 (player1 pos44 pos45 dirdown)

Now the player is at pos45 and the stone is also at pos45, which isn't valid. I need to revise my plan.

Let me rethink this problem. We have a stone at pos32 and want to move it to pos53 (the goal). The player starts at pos45.

Rethinking the constraint "If expression 'Location pos35 is not clear' holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which 'player1 is at location pos44' is true". This means before pos35 becomes occupied, the player must have been at pos44 at some point.

Let's plan a path for the stone:
- Stone starts at pos32
- We need to move it to pos53 (the goal)
- A direct path could be: pos32 -> pos33 -> pos43 -> pos53

To push the stone along this path, the player needs to be:
- At pos31 to push from pos32 to pos33
- At pos32 to push from pos33 to pos43
- At pos33 to push from pos43 to pos53

Another constraint is "player1 is not at location pos41". Let me plan a path for the player that avoids pos41 and satisfies the constraints:

1. Player at pos45, stone at pos32
2. Move player1 from pos45 to pos44 (player1 pos45 pos44 dirup)
   - Player has been at pos44, satisfying one constraint
3. Move player1 from pos44 to pos43 (player1 pos44 pos43 dirup)
4. Move player1 from pos43 to pos33 (player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft)
5. Move player1 from pos33 to pos23 (player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft)
6. Move player1 from pos23 to pos22 (player1 pos23 pos22 dirup)
7. Move player1 from pos22 to pos21 (player1 pos22 pos21 dirleft)
8. Move player1 from pos21 to pos31 (player1 pos21 pos31 dirright)

At this point, the player is at pos31 and the stone is at pos32. The player is to the left of the stone. Let's push it:
9. Push stone1 from pos32 to pos33 (pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos32 pos33 dirright)
   - Player is now at pos32, stone is at pos33

10. Push stone1 from pos33 to pos43 (pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos33 pos43 dirdown)
    - Player is now at pos33, stone is at pos43

11. Push stone1 from pos43 to pos53 (pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos43 pos53 dirright)
    - Player is now at pos43, stone is at pos53 (goal)

But this plan doesn't make pos35 not clear at any point. Let's try an alternate path for the stone:
- Stone starts at pos32
- We could move it to: pos32 -> pos33 -> pos34 -> pos35 -> pos45 -> pos55 -> pos54 -> pos53

Let me plan this out:

1. Player at pos45, stone at pos32
2. Move player1 from pos45 to pos44 (player1 pos45 pos44 dirup)
   - Player has been at pos44, satisfying one constraint
3. Move player1 from pos44 to pos43 (player1 pos44 pos43 dirup)
4. Move player1 from pos43 to pos33 (player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft)
5. Move player1 from pos33 to pos23 (player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft)
6. Move player1 from pos23 to pos22 (player1 pos23 pos22 dirup)
7. Move player1 from pos22 to pos21 (player1 pos22 pos21 dirleft)
8. Move player1 from pos21 to pos31 (player1 pos21 pos31 dirright)

9. Push stone1 from pos32 to pos33 (pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos32 pos33 dirright)
   - Player is now at pos32, stone is at pos33

10. Push stone1 from pos33 to pos34 (pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos33 pos34 dirright)
    - Player is now at pos33, stone is at pos34

11. Push stone1 from pos34 to pos35 (pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos34 pos35 dirright)
    - Player is now at pos34, stone is at pos35
    - pos35 is now not clear, and the player was at pos44 before this, satisfying the constraint

12. Push stone1 from pos35 to pos45 (pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos35 pos45 dirdown)
    - Player is now at pos35, stone is at pos45

But now I need to move the stone from pos45 to pos55, which means the player needs to be at pos35. The player is already at pos35, but the next push will change that.

13. Push stone1 from pos45 to pos55 (pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos35 pos45 pos55 dirright)
    - Player is now at pos45, stone is at pos55

14. Move player1 from pos45 to pos55 (player1 pos45 pos55 dirright)
15. Move player1 from pos55 to pos54 (player1 pos55 pos54 dirup)

16. Push stone1 from pos55 to pos54 (pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos54 pos55 pos54 dirleft)
    - Player is now at pos55, stone is at pos54

But wait, the player is at pos54 and the stone is at pos55, they can't both be at pos54. Let me correct this.

14. Move player1 from pos45 to pos35 (player1 pos45 pos35 dirleft)
15. Move player1 from pos35 to pos34 (player1 pos35 pos34 dirup)
16. Move player1 from pos34 to pos44 (player1 pos34 pos44 dirright)
17. Move player1 from pos44 to pos54 (player1 pos44 pos54 dirright)

18. Push stone1 from pos55 to pos54 (pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos54 pos55 pos54 dirleft)
    - Player is now at pos55, stone is at pos54

19. Push stone1 from pos54 to pos53 (pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos55 pos54 pos53 dirleft)
    - Player is now at pos54, stone is at pos53 (goal)

This plan satisfies all the constraints:
- pos35 is not clear at some point (when the stone is there)
- before pos35 becomes not clear, the player was at pos44
- the player never visits pos41
- pos52 remains clear throughout

But let me check the direction issue once more. 

In the grid, using a standard (row, column) coordinate system with row 1 at the top:
- dirup means moving to a lower row number (upwards on the grid)
- dirdown means moving to a higher row number (downwards on the grid)
- dirleft means moving to a lower column number (left on the grid)
- dirright means moving to a higher column number (right on the grid)

Given that understanding, let's double-check my plan:

1. Player at pos45 (4th row, 5th column), stone at pos32 (3rd row, 2nd column)
2. Move player1 from pos45 to pos44 (dirup) - correct, moving to 4th row, 4th column
3. Move player1 from pos44 to pos43 (dirup) - correct, moving to 4th row, 3rd column
4. Move player1 from pos43 to pos33 (dirleft) - this should be dirup, not dirleft
   - Corrected: Move player1 from pos43 to pos33 (dirup) - moving to 3rd row, 3rd column

Let me correct the entire path:

1. Player at pos45 (4th row, 5th column), stone at pos32 (3rd row, 2nd column)
2. Move player1 from pos45 to pos44 (dirup) - moving to 4th row, 4th column
3. Move player1 from pos44 to pos43 (dirleft) - moving to 4th row, 3rd column
4. Move player1 from pos43 to pos33 (dirup) - moving to 3rd row, 3rd column
5. Move player1 from pos33 to pos23 (dirup) - moving to 2nd row, 3rd column
6. Move player1 from pos23 to pos22 (dirleft) - moving to 2nd row, 2nd column
7. Move player1 from pos22 to pos21 (dirleft) - moving to 2nd row, 1st column
8. Move player1 from pos21 to pos31 (dirdown) - moving to 3rd row, 1st column

9. Push stone1 from pos32 to pos33 (pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos32 pos33 dirright)
   - Player is now at pos32, stone is at pos33

10. Push stone1 from pos33 to pos34 (pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos33 pos34 dirright)
    - Player is now at pos33, stone is at pos34

11. Push stone1 from pos34 to pos35 (pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos34 pos35 dirright)
    - Player is now at pos34, stone is at pos35
    - pos35 is now not clear, and the player was at pos44 before this, satisfying the constraint

12. Push stone1 from pos35 to pos45 (pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos35 pos45 dirdown)
    - Player is now at pos35, stone is at pos45

13. Move player1 from pos35 to pos25 (dirup)
14. Move player1 from pos25 to pos24 (dirleft)
15. Move player1 from pos24 to pos34 (dirdown)
16. Move player1 from pos34 to pos44 (dirdown)
17. Move player1 from pos44 to pos54 (dirdown)

18. Push stone1 from pos45 to pos55 (pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos54 pos45 pos55 dirright)
    - Player is now at pos45, stone is at pos55

This push doesn't work, because the player at pos54 can't push the stone at pos45 to pos55 in the dirright direction. The player needs to be at pos35.

Let me correct the path again:

13. Move player1 from pos35 to pos45 (dirdown)
    - This doesn't work because the stone is at pos45.

Let me rethink the path completely. We have:
- Player at pos45 (4th row, 5th column)
- Stone at pos32 (3rd row, 2nd column)
- Goal at pos53 (5th row, 3rd column)

Let's try a different approach:

1. Move player1 from pos45 to pos44 (dirleft)
2. Move player1 from pos44 to pos43 (dirleft)
3. Move player1 from pos43 to pos33 (dirup)
4. Move player1 from pos33 to pos32 (dirleft)
   - This doesn't work because the stone is at pos32.

Let me map out a completely new path. We have:
- Player at pos45
- Stone at pos32
- Goal at pos53

To push the stone, the player needs to be adjacent to it. Let's get the player to pos31:

1. Move player1 from pos45 to pos44 (dirleft)
2. Move player1 from pos44 to pos43 (dirleft)
3. Move player1 from pos43 to pos33 (dirup)
4. Move player1 from pos33 to pos23 (dirup)
5. Move player1 from pos23 to pos22 (dirleft)
6. Move player1 from pos22 to pos21 (dirleft)
7. Move player1 from pos21 to pos31 (dirdown)

Now the player is at pos31 (to the left of the stone). Let's push the stone to the right:

8. Push stone1 from pos32 to pos33 (pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos32 pos33 dirright)
   - Player is now at pos32, stone is at pos33

Let's push the stone to the goal:

9. Push stone1 from pos33 to pos43 (pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos33 pos43 dirdown)
   - Player is now at pos33, stone is at pos43

10. Push stone1 from pos43 to pos53 (pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos43 pos53 dirright)
    - Player is now at pos43, stone is at pos53 (goal)

This plan doesn't satisfy the constraint that pos35 must not be clear at some point. Let's try to move the stone through pos35:

1. Move player1 from pos45 to pos44 (dirleft)
2. Move player1 from pos44 to pos43 (dirleft)
3. Move player1 from pos43 to pos33 (dirup)
4. Move player1 from pos33 to pos23 (dirup)
5. Move player1 from pos23 to pos22 (dirleft)
6. Move player1 from pos22 to pos21 (dirleft)
7. Move player1 from pos21 to pos31 (dirdown)

8. Push stone1 from pos32 to pos33 (pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos32 pos33 dirright)
   - Player is now at pos32, stone is at pos33

9. Push stone1 from pos33 to pos34 (pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos33 pos34 dirright)
   - Player is now at pos33, stone is at pos34

10. Push stone1 from pos34 to pos35 (pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos34 pos35 dirright)
    - Player is now at pos34, stone is at pos35
    - Now pos35 is not clear

11. Push stone1 from pos35 to pos45 (pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos35 pos45 dirdown)
    - Player is now at pos35, stone is at pos45

12. Move player1 from pos35 to pos34 (dirleft)
13. Move player1 from pos34 to pos24 (dirup)
14. Move player1 from pos24 to pos14 (dirup)
15. Move player1 from pos14 to pos13 (dirleft)
16. Move player1 from pos13 to pos23 (dirdown)
17. Move player1 from pos23 to pos33 (dirdown)
18. Move player1 from pos33 to pos43 (dirdown)
19. Move player1 from pos43 to pos53 (dirdown)

20. Push stone1 from pos45 to pos44 (pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos53 pos45 pos44 dirleft)
    - This doesn't work because dirdown from pos53 would be to pos54, not pos45.

I'm still getting confused with the directions. Let me make sure I'm visualizing the grid correctly:
```
   1 2 3 4 5
  ---------
1| . . . . .
2| . . . . .
3| . S . . .  (S = stone1 at pos32)
4| . . . . P  (P = player1 at pos45)
5| . . G . .  (G = goal at pos53)
```

In this grid:
- dirup means moving to a lower row number (upwards on the grid)
- dirdown means moving to a higher row number (downwards on the grid)
- dirleft means moving to a lower column number (left on the grid)
- dirright means moving to a higher column number (right on the grid)

So from pos45, dirdown would move to pos55, not pos44. Let me correct my understanding:
- From pos45, moving dirleft would go to pos44
- From pos45, moving dirup would go to pos35

Let's re-plan with this understanding:

1. Player at pos45, stone at pos32, goal at pos53
2. Move player1 from pos45 to pos35 (dirup)
3. Move player1 from pos35 to pos25 (dirup)
4. Move player1 from pos25 to pos24 (dirleft)
5. Move player1 from pos24 to pos23 (dirleft)
6. Move player1 from pos23 to pos33 (dirdown)
7. Move player1 from pos33 to pos43 (dirdown)
8. Move player1 from pos43 to pos44 (dirright)
   - Player is now at pos44, satisfying the constraint that the player must be at pos44 before pos35 is not clear

9. Move player1 from pos44 to pos34 (dirup)
10. Move player1 from pos34 to pos33 (dirleft)
11. Move player1 from pos33 to pos23 (dirup)
12. Move player1 from pos23 to pos22 (dirleft)
13. Move player1 from pos22 to pos32 (dirdown)
    - This doesn't work because the stone is at pos32.

Let's try another approach:

1. Player at pos45, stone at pos32, goal at pos53
2. Move player1 from pos45 to pos35 (dirup)
3. Move player1 from pos35 to pos25 (dirup)
4. Move player1 from pos25 to pos24 (dirleft)
5. Move player1 from pos24 to pos23 (dirleft)
6. Move player1 from pos23 to pos22 (dirleft)
7. Move player1 from pos22 to pos21 (dirleft)
8. Move player1 from pos21 to pos31 (dirdown)

Now the player is at pos31, to the left of the stone at pos32.

9. Push stone1 from pos32 to pos33 (pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos32 pos33 dirright)
   - Player is now at pos32, stone is at pos33

10. Move player1 from pos32 to pos42 (dirdown)
11. Move player1 from pos42 to pos43 (dirright)
12. Move player1 from pos43 to pos44 (dirright)
    - Player is now at pos44, satisfying the constraint

13. Move player1 from pos44 to pos34 (dirup)
14. Move player1 from pos34 to pos35 (dirright)
    - Player is now at pos35, making it not clear, and the player was at pos44 before this, satisfying the constraint

15. Move player1 from pos35 to pos34 (dirleft)
16. Move player1 from pos34 to pos33 (dirleft)

17. Push stone1 from pos33 to pos43 (pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos33 pos43 dirdown)
    - This doesn't work because the player is at pos34, not adjacent to the stone in the direction of the push.

Let me revise again:

1. Player at pos45, stone at pos32, goal at pos53
2. Move player1 from pos45 to pos35 (dirup)
3. Move player1 from pos35 to pos25 (dirup)
4. Move player1 from pos25 to pos24 (dirleft)
5. Move player1 from pos24 to pos23 (dirleft)
6. Move player1 from pos23 to pos22 (dirleft)
7. Move player1 from pos22 to pos21 (dirleft)
8. Move player1 from pos21 to pos31 (dirdown)

Now the player is at pos31, to the left of the stone at pos32.

9. Push stone1 from pos32 to pos33 (pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos32 pos33 dirright)
   - Player is now at pos32, stone is at pos33

10. Push stone1 from pos33 to pos34 (pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos33 pos34 dirright)
    - Player is now at pos33, stone is at pos34

11. Move player1 from pos33 to pos43 (dirdown)
12. Move player1 from pos43 to pos44 (dirright)
    - Player is now at pos44, satisfying the constraint

13. Move player1 from pos44 to pos34 (dirup)

14. Push stone1 from pos34 to pos35 (pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos34 pos35 dirright)
    - This doesn't work because the player is at pos44, not adjacent to the stone in the direction of the push. 
    Correction: the player is at pos34, and if I move to the left of the stone at pos33, I could push it to the right:
    Push stone1 from pos34 to pos35 (pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos34 pos35 dirright)
    - Player is now at pos34, stone is at pos35
    - Now pos35 is not clear, and the player was at pos44 before this, satisfying the constraint

Let me revise once more. I'm still making errors in the push mechanics. For a push, the player and stone need to be in a line, with the player behind the stone in the direction of the push.

I'll start completely fresh.

Player at pos45, stone at pos32, goal at pos53

1. Player needs to get to pos44 (to satisfy the constraint that player must be at pos44 before pos35 is not clear)
2. Player needs to push the stone through pos35 (to satisfy the constraint that pos35 must not be clear at some point)
3. Player must never be at pos41 (to satisfy the constraint that player is never at pos41)
4. Player needs to push the stone to pos53 (to reach the goal)

Let's plan a path:

1. Move player1 from pos45 to pos44 (player1 pos45 pos44 dirleft)
   - Player is now at pos44, satisfying one constraint

2. Move player1 from pos44 to pos43 (player1 pos44 pos43 dirleft)
3. Move player1 from pos43 to pos33 (player1 pos43 pos33 dirup)
4. Move player1 from pos33 to pos23 (player1 pos33 pos23 dirup)
5. Move player1 from pos23 to pos22 (player1 pos23 pos22 dirleft)
6. Move player1 from pos22 to pos21 (player1 pos22 pos21 dirleft)
7. Move player1 from pos21 to pos31 (player1 pos21 pos31 dirdown)

8. Push stone1 from pos32 to pos33 (pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos32 pos33 dirright)
   - Player is now at pos32, stone is at pos33

9. Push stone1 from pos33 to pos34 (pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos33 pos34 dirright)
   - Player is now at pos33, stone is at pos34

10. Push stone1 from pos34 to pos35 (pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos34 pos35 dirright)
    - Player is now at pos34, stone is at pos35
    - pos35 is now not clear, and the player was at pos44 before this, satisfying the constraint

Now let's get the stone to the goal:

11. Push stone1 from pos35 to pos45 (pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos35 pos45 dirdown)
    - Player is now at pos35, stone is at pos45

12. Move player1 from pos35 to pos34 (player1 pos35 pos34 dirleft)
13. Move player1 from pos34 to pos33 (player1 pos34 pos33 dirleft)
14. Move player1 from pos33 to pos43 (player1 pos33 pos43 dirdown)

15. Push stone1 from pos45 to pos44 (pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos45 pos44 dirleft)
    - This doesn't work because from pos43, pos45 is not in the dirright direction.

Let me try a different approach for getting the stone from pos45 to pos53:

12. Move player1 from pos35 to pos25 (player1 pos35 pos25 dirup)
13. Move player1 from pos25 to pos15 (player1 pos25 pos15 dirup)
14. Move player1 from pos15 to pos14 (player1 pos15 pos14 dirleft)
15. Move player1 from pos14 to pos24 (player1 pos14 pos24 dirdown)
16. Move player1 from pos24 to pos34 (player1 pos24 pos34 dirdown)
17. Move player1 from pos34 to pos44 (player1 pos34 pos44 dirdown)
18. Move player1 from pos44 to pos54 (player1 pos44 pos54 dirdown)
19. Move player1 from pos54 to pos53 (player1 pos54 pos53 dirleft)
20. Move player1 from pos53 to pos43 (player1 pos53 pos43 dirup)
21. Move player1 from pos43 to pos44 (player1 pos43 pos44 dirright)

This push direction won't work either. Let me just get the stone to the goal directly from pos35:

11. Push stone1 from pos35 to pos25 (pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos35 pos25 dirup)
    - Player is now at pos35, stone is at pos25

12. Move player1 from pos35 to pos34 (player1 pos35 pos34 dirleft)
13. Move player1 from pos34 to pos24 (player1 pos34 pos24 dirup)

14. Push stone1 from pos25 to pos35 (pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos25 pos35 dirdown)
    - Player is now at pos25, stone is at pos35
    - pos35 is not clear again

This isn't helping. Let me try a more direct approach:

11. Push stone1 from pos35 to pos45 (pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos35 pos45 dirdown)
    - Player is now at pos35, stone is at pos45

12. Move player1 from pos35 to pos34 (player1 pos35 pos34 dirleft)
13. Move player1 from pos34 to pos33 (player1 pos34 pos33 dirleft)
14. Move player1 from pos33 to pos43 (player1 pos33 pos43 dirdown)
15. Move player1 from pos43 to pos53 (player1 pos43 pos53 dirdown)

16. Push stone1 from pos45 to pos55 (pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos53 pos45 pos55 dirright)
    - This doesn't work, the player can't push in this direction from this position.

OK, let me try one more approach:

1. Move player1 from pos45 to pos44 (player1 pos45 pos44 dirleft)
   - Player is now at pos44, satisfying one constraint

2. Move player1 from pos44 to pos34 (player1 pos44 pos34 dirup)
3. Move player1 from pos34 to pos33 (player1 pos34 pos33 dirleft)
4. Move player1 from pos33 to pos23 (player1 pos33 pos23 dirup)
5. Move player1 from pos23 to pos22 (player1 pos23 pos22 dirleft)
6. Move player1 from pos22 to pos21 (player1 pos22 pos21 dirleft)
7. Move player1 from pos21 to pos31 (player1 pos21 pos31 dirdown)

8. Push stone1 from pos32 to pos33 (pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos32 pos33 dirright)
   - Player is now at pos32, stone is at pos33

9. Push stone1 from pos33 to pos34 (pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos33 pos34 dirright)
   - Player is now at pos33, stone is at pos34

10. Push stone1 from pos34 to pos35 (pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos34 pos35 dirright)
    - Player is now at pos34, stone is at pos35
    - pos35 is now not clear, and the player was at pos44 before this, satisfying the constraint

11. Push stone1 from pos35 to pos25 (pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos35 pos25 dirup)
    - Player is now at pos35, stone is at pos25

12. Move player1 from pos35 to pos45 (player1 pos35 pos45 dirdown)
13. Move player1 from pos45 to pos55 (player1 pos45 pos55 dirdown)
14. Move player1 from pos55 to pos54 (player1 pos55 pos54 dirleft)
15. Move player1 from pos54 to pos53 (player1 pos54 pos53 dirleft)
16. Move player1 from pos53 to pos43 (player1 pos53 pos43 dirup)
17. Move player1 from pos43 to pos33 (player1 pos43 pos33 dirup)
18. Move player1 from pos33 to pos23 (player1 pos33 pos23 dirup)
19. Move player1 from pos23 to pos24 (player1 pos23 pos24 dirright)

20. Push stone1 from pos25 to pos35 (pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos25 pos35 dirdown)
    - Player is now at pos25, stone is at pos35
    - pos35 is not clear again

21. Push stone1 from pos35 to pos45 (pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos25 pos35 pos45 dirdown)
    - Player is now at pos35, stone is at pos45

22. Push stone1 from pos45 to pos55 (pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos35 pos45 pos55 dirdown)
    - Player is now at pos45, stone is at pos55

23. Move player1 from pos45 to pos44 (player1 pos45 pos44 dirleft)
24. Move player1 from pos44 to pos43 (player1 pos44 pos43 dirleft)
25. Move player1 from pos43 to pos53 (player1 pos43 pos53 dirdown)
26. Move player1 from pos53 to pos54 (player1 pos53 pos54 dirright)

27. Push stone1 from pos55 to pos54 (pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos53 pos55 pos54 dirleft)
    - This doesn't work, the directions are still incorrect.

I feel like I'm getting confused with the directions. Let's try a completely different approach. Going back to a more direct path:

1. Move player1 from pos45 to pos44 (player1 pos45 pos44 dirleft)
   - Player is now at pos44, satisfying one constraint

2. Move player1 from pos44 to pos34 (player1 pos44 pos34 dirup)
3. Move player1 from pos34 to pos24 (player1 pos34 pos24 dirup)
4. Move player1 from pos24 to pos23 (player1 pos24 pos23 dirleft)
5. Move player1 from pos23 to pos22 (player1 pos23 pos22 dirleft)
6. Move player1 from pos22 to pos32 (player1 pos22 pos32 dirdown)
    - This doesn't work, the stone is at pos32.

Let's try a completely different approach, and make sure I'm thinking about the directions correctly.

The grid is:
```
   1 2 3 4 5
  ---------
1| . . . . .
2| . . . . .
3| . S . . .  (S = stone1 at pos32)
4| . . . . P  (P = player1 at pos45)
5| . . G . .  (G = goal at pos53)
```

We have a constraint that the player must be at pos44 before pos35 is not clear. Let's get the player to pos44 first:

1. Move player1 from pos45 to pos44 (player1 pos45 pos44 dirleft)

Now let's get the player to the stone and push it to pos35:

2. Move player1 from pos44 to pos34 (player1 pos44 pos34 dirup)
3. Move player1 from pos34 to pos24 (player1 pos34 pos24 dirup)
4. Move player1 from pos24 to pos23 (player1 pos24 pos23 dirleft)
5. Move player1 from pos23 to pos33 (player1 pos23 pos33 dirdown)

Now the player is at pos33, to the right of the stone at pos32. Let's push it to the right, towards pos35:

6. Push stone1 from pos32 to pos33 (pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos32 pos33 dirleft)
    - Wait, that doesn't make sense. If the player is at pos33 and the stone is at pos32, the player can't push the stone left. Let me try again.

2. Move player1 from pos44 to pos43 (player1 pos44 pos43 dirleft)
3. Move player1 from pos43 to pos33 (player1 pos43 pos33 dirup)
4. Move player1 from pos33 to pos23 (player1 pos33 pos23 dirup)
5. Move player1 from pos23 to pos22 (player1 pos23 pos22 dirleft)
6. Move player1 from pos22 to pos21 (player1 pos22 pos21 dirleft)
7. Move player1 from pos21 to pos31 (player1 pos21 pos31 dirdown)

Now the player is at pos31, to the left of the stone at pos32. Let's push it to the right, towards pos35:

8. Push stone1 from pos32 to pos33 (pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos32 pos33 dirright)
   - Player is now at pos32, stone is at pos33

9. Push stone1 from pos33 to pos34 (pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos33 pos34 dirright)
   - Player is now at pos33, stone is at pos34

10. Push stone1 from pos34 to pos35 (pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos34 pos35 dirright)
    - Player is now at pos34, stone is at pos35
    - pos35 is now not clear, and the player was at pos44 before this, satisfying the constraint

Now, we need to get the stone to the goal at pos53. Let's plan a path:

11. Push stone1 from pos35 to pos45 (pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos35 pos45 dirdown)
    - Player is now at pos35, stone is at pos45

We need to get the stone from pos45 to pos53. One path could be: pos45 -> pos44 -> pos43 -> pos53.

12. Move player1 from pos35 to pos45 (player1 pos35 pos45 dirdown)
    - This doesn't work, the stone is at pos45. Let's try a different path.

Let's try to get the stone to pos53 directly from pos35:

11. Move player1 from pos34 to pos33 (player1 pos34 pos33 dirleft)
12. Move player1 from pos33 to pos43 (player1 pos33 pos43 dirdown)
13. Move player1 from pos43 to pos53 (player1 pos43 pos53 dirdown)
14. Move player1 from pos53 to pos54 (player1 pos53 pos54 dirright)
15. Move player1 from pos54 to pos44 (player1 pos54 pos44 dirup)
16. Move player1 from pos44 to pos34 (player1 pos44 pos34 dirup)

This won't work, I can't get in the right position to push the stone from pos35 to pos53 directly.

Let me try again, pushing the stone from pos35 -> pos34 -> pos33 -> pos43 -> pos53:

11. Move player1 from pos34 to pos24 (player1 pos34 pos24 dirup)
12. Move player1 from pos24 to pos25 (player1 pos24 pos25 dirright)

13. Push stone1 from pos35 to pos34 (pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos25 pos35 pos34 dirleft)
    - Player is now at pos35, stone is at pos34

14. Push stone1 from pos34 to pos33 (pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos35 pos34 pos33 dirleft)
    - Player is now at pos34, stone is at pos33

15. Push stone1 from pos33 to pos43 (pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos33 pos43 dirdown)
    - Player is now at pos33, stone is at pos43

16. Push stone1 from pos43 to pos53 (pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos43 pos53 dirright)
    - Player is now at pos43, stone is at pos53 (goal)
