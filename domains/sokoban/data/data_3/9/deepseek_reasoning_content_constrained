Okay, let's try to figure out how to solve this planning problem. So, the goal is to get stone1 to a goal location. From the initial state, stone1 is at pos32, and the only goal location mentioned is pos53. So, I need to move stone1 from pos32 to pos53.

First, let's check the constraints. The constraints are:

1. At some point, pos35 must not be clear. That means either the agent or a stone has to be there. But since the only stone is stone1, which starts at pos32 and needs to go to pos53, maybe we have to pass through pos35? Wait, but pos35 is not a goal location. So maybe the agent has to be there at some point. But how?

Also, the second constraint says that if pos35 is not clear in some state, there must have been a previous state where the player is at pos44. So the agent needs to be at pos44 before making pos35 occupied.

Third constraint: the player can never be at pos41. So any path that involves moving through pos41 is invalid. Similarly, pos52 must always be clear. So the agent can't be there, and stones can't be there either. Since there's only one stone, stone1, and it's moving to pos53, we need to ensure that pos52 remains clear. So when moving stone1 to pos53, we must do it in a way that doesn't involve pos52.

Let me map out the grid. The locations are posXY where X is the row and Y the column. So pos11 is top-left, pos55 is bottom-right. pos53 is a goal location. The agent starts at pos45. Stone1 is at pos32.

The agent needs to push stone1 to pos53. Let's see the possible paths.

From pos32, possible directions are up, down, left, right based on the movement allowed. Let's check the allowed moves for pos32:

Looking at the initial state's movement possibilities:

For pos32, the allowed moves are to pos22 (dirleft), pos42 (dirright), pos31 (dirup), pos33 (dirdown). Wait, the movement directions are specified as "You may move from location pos32 to location pos22 following direction dirleft" (so left direction), to pos42 via dirright, pos31 via dirup, and pos33 via dirdown.

So, to push the stone from pos32 to pos33 (down), the agent would need to be at pos32's adjacent tile in the opposite direction. Wait, the push actions require that the agent is at l_p, which is adjacent in direction d to l_from (the stone's current position). For example, to push the stone from pos32 to pos33 (dirdown), the agent needs to be at pos32's up direction, which is pos22? Wait no, the direction for pushing would be such that the agent is adjacent to the stone in the direction opposite to where the stone is moving. Let me think.

Wait, the action "pushtogoal" has preconditions: agent is at l_p, stone is at l_from. The direction d must allow moving from l_p to l_from, and from l_from to l_to. So, for example, if the agent is at pos22 (which is north of pos32), then direction dirdown would allow moving from pos22 to pos32 (since "You may move from location pos22 to location pos32 following direction dirright"? Wait, no. Let me check the movement again. The movement from pos22 to pos32 is via dirright. Wait, pos22 is (2,2), moving right would go to (2,3), but pos32 is (3,2). Hmm, maybe the directions are a bit confusing. Wait, the movement from pos22 to pos32 is via direction dirright? Wait no. Let me check the movement for pos22:

Looking at the initial movement connections:

"You may move from location pos22 to location pos12 following direction dirleft" (left direction, which would decrease the column by 1, from 2 to 1, so pos12 is (1,2)), but wait, pos22 is row 2, column 2. Moving left would be column 1, so pos21? Wait, maybe the directions are not aligned as I thought. Let me see the movement list again.

Wait, here's an example: "You may move from location pos32 to location pos22 following direction dirleft". So moving from pos32 (3,2) to pos22 (2,2) is dirleft. Wait, that's moving up. So dirleft corresponds to moving up? Or maybe the directions are based on the grid's axes. Maybe dirleft is moving west (left), dirright is east (right), dirup is north, dirdown is south. Wait, but how does that fit with the movement from pos32 to pos22 being dirleft? Because pos32 is (3,2) (assuming first digit is row, second is column), then pos22 is (2,2), which is north. So moving from pos32 to pos22 would require direction dirup, but according to the given movement, it's dirleft. That's conflicting. So maybe the directions are not aligned with the grid as I thought. This is a crucial point. Let me check the movement directions carefully.

Let's take a specific example: "You may move from location pos32 to location pos22 following direction dirleft". So moving from pos32 to pos22 is dirleft. pos32 to pos22 is moving up one row (from row 3 to 2, same column 2). So dirleft here corresponds to moving up. Similarly, "You may move from location pos32 to location pos42 following direction dirright": pos42 is (4,2), which is down one row from pos32. So dirright corresponds to moving down. Hmm, that's confusing. So in this grid, directions are not the usual cardinal directions. Instead, dirleft and dirright might correspond to moving along rows or columns. Alternatively, perhaps the directions are mapped as follows: dirleft is north, dirright is south, dirup is west, dirdown is east. But that's just a guess. Alternatively, perhaps the directions are arbitrary, and the allowed movements are given as per the problem statement. So regardless of the actual direction labels, the movement is predefined. So for example, moving from pos32 to pos22 is via dirleft, which could be moving north. Then moving from pos32 to pos42 is via dirright (south). From pos32 to pos31 via dirup (west?), and pos33 via dirdown (east?).

Wait, but the directions are dirdown, dirleft, dirright, dirup. So perhaps the movement is based on the direction names, but the actual direction in the grid is not as per standard. Let's not get stuck here. The key is to follow the given movement paths. So for example, from pos32, the possible moves are to pos22 (dirleft), pos42 (dirright), pos31 (dirup), pos33 (dirdown). So the direction names might not correspond to actual directions, but just labels. So to move from pos32 to pos33, direction is dirdown. To move from pos32 to pos31, direction is dirup. So for the stone at pos32, to push it to pos33 (dirdown), the agent must be at pos32's dirup direction, which is pos31. Wait, no. The action pushtogoal requires that the agent can move from l_p to l_from following direction d, and from l_from to l_to following direction d. Wait, for the push action, the agent is at l_p, then moves to l_from (the stone's current position), pushing the stone to l_to. So the direction d must allow moving from l_p to l_from (so l_p is adjacent to l_from in direction d), and then from l_from to l_to (so l_to is adjacent to l_from in direction d). So for example, if the agent is at pos31 (l_p), and the stone is at pos32 (l_from), then direction d would be dirright (since from pos31 to pos32 is dirright, according to the movement: "You may move from location pos31 to location pos32 following direction dirdown". Wait, no. Let me check the movement from pos31. The movement for pos31 says: "You may move from location pos31 to location pos21 following direction dirleft", "You may move from location pos31 to location pos41 following direction dirright", "You may move from location pos31 to location pos32 following direction dirdown". So moving from pos31 to pos32 is via dirdown. So direction d for that movement is dirdown. So if the agent is at pos31 (l_p) and wants to push the stone from pos32 (l_from) to pos33 (l_to), the direction would need to be such that moving from l_p (pos31) to l_from (pos32) is possible via direction d, and moving from l_from to l_to via direction d. So direction d must be dirdown, because from pos31 to pos32 is dirdown, and from pos32 to pos33 is dirdown. So that's possible. So the agent can be at pos31, push the stone from pos32 to pos33 via dirdown. But the problem is that the agent starts at pos45. So how to get to pos31? Let's map the path.

Agent starts at pos45. Needs to get to pos31. Let's see the movement possibilities. Let's see possible paths:

From pos45, possible movements:

Looking at the movement for pos45:

"You may move from location pos45 to location pos35 following direction dirleft"

"You may move from location pos45 to location pos55 following direction dirright"

"You may move from location pos45 to location pos44 following direction dirup"

So from pos45, the agent can go to pos35 (dirleft), pos55 (dirright), or pos44 (dirup). But the constraints say that the agent must never be at pos41. Also, pos52 must always be clear. So the agent can't go to pos52, but since it's starting at pos45, moving to pos44 (dirup) would be possible.

But let's think: the stone is at pos32. The goal is to get it to pos53, which is a goal location. So possible path for the stone: pos32 -> pos33 -> pos34 -> pos44 -> pos54 -> pos53. But pos54 is not a goal, but pos53 is. Alternatively, maybe a shorter path. Let's see.

Alternatively, from pos32, the agent could push the stone to pos33 (dirdown), then to pos34 (dirdown), then to pos44 (dirright?), but let's check movement possibilities.

From pos33, possible movements:

"You may move from location pos33 to location pos23 following direction dirleft"

"You may move from location pos33 to location pos43 following direction dirright"

"You may move from location pos33 to location pos32 following direction dirup"

"You may move from location pos33 to location pos34 following direction dirdown"

So from pos33, pushing the stone to pos34 (dirdown), then from pos34, pushing to pos44 (dirright). Then from pos44, pushing to pos54 (dirright), but pos54 is not a goal. Wait, the goal is pos53. So maybe a different path. Let's see:

From pos32, pushing the stone to pos42 (dirright) would require the agent to be at pos32's dirleft (pos22), but that's a longer path. Or to push to pos33 (dirdown), then pos34 (dirdown), then pos44 (dirright?), wait, from pos34, can we push right to pos44? Let's check the movement from pos34:

"You may move from location pos34 to location pos24 following direction dirleft"

"You may move from location pos34 to location pos44 following direction dirright"

"You may move from location pos34 to location pos33 following direction dirup"

"You may move from location pos34 to location pos35 following direction dirdown"

So from pos34, dirright leads to pos44. So if the stone is at pos34, the agent can push it to pos44 (dirright) if the agent is at pos34's dirleft (pos24), but that's getting complicated. Alternatively, maybe the agent can push the stone from pos32 to pos33 (dirdown), then from pos33 to pos43 (dirright), which is a goal location? Wait, pos43 is not a goal. The only goal is pos53. So the stone needs to reach pos53. So let's think of pushing the stone eastward towards column 3, then south to row5, column3 (pos53). Wait, pos53 is in row5, column3. So to get from pos32 (3,2) to pos53 (5,3), the stone needs to move down two rows and right one column.

Possible path:

pos32 → pos33 (dirdown) → pos34 (dirdown) → pos44 (dirright) → pos54 (dirright) → pos53 (dirup). But pos54 is not a goal, so the final push from pos54 to pos53 would have to be a pushtogoal action, but pos53 is a goal. Wait, but pushing from pos54 to pos53 is direction dirup (since pos54 to pos53 is moving up). So the agent would need to be south of pos54 (pos54's down is pos55?), but I need to check movement from pos54.

Wait, movement from pos54: "You may move from location pos54 to location pos44 following direction dirleft", "You may move from location pos54 to location pos53 following direction dirup", "You may move from location pos54 to location pos55 following direction dirdown". So to push the stone from pos54 to pos53 (dirup), the agent needs to be at pos54's dirdown (pos55). So the agent would be at pos55, push the stone up to pos54 to pos53. But pos55 is not a goal, but the stone is moving to pos53 which is a goal. So that's possible. But getting the agent to pos55 would require moving there, but pos55 is allowed as long as pos52 remains clear. But the agent moving through pos55 is okay as long as they don't go to pos41 or pos52.

But this path seems long. Let's think of a shorter path. Maybe from pos32, the agent can push the stone to pos33 (dirdown), then to pos43 (dirright), then to pos53 (dirright). Let's check:

From pos33, can the agent push the stone to pos43 (dirright)? To do that, the agent needs to be at pos33's dirleft (pos23?), and direction dirright. Let's check the movement from pos33 to pos43: "You may move from location pos33 to location pos43 following direction dirright". So yes. So if the stone is at pos33, the agent can be at pos23 (dirleft of pos33) and push it to pos43 (dirright). Then from pos43, push to pos53 (dirright). Let's see:

From pos43, the movement to pos53 is via dirright: "You may move from location pos43 to location pos53 following direction dirright". So the agent would need to be at pos43's dirleft (pos33) to push the stone to pos53. Then that's a valid push. But how does the agent get to pos23 from the starting position?

Wait, the agent starts at pos45. To get to pos23, that's a long way. Let's map a possible path for the agent.

From pos45:

pos45 → pos44 (dirup)

pos44 → pos34 (dirleft)

pos34 → pos24 (dirleft)

pos24 → pos14 (dirleft)

pos14 → pos24 (wait, no. Let's check movement options step by step.

Alternatively, maybe a better path. From pos45, the agent can move to pos35 via dirleft.

pos35 → pos25 via dirleft?

Wait, movement from pos35: "You may move from location pos35 to location pos25 following direction dirleft", "You may move from location pos35 to location pos45 following direction dirright", "You may move from location pos35 to location pos34 following direction dirup".

So from pos35, the agent can go to pos25 (dirleft), pos45 (dirright), or pos34 (dirup).

Hmm, getting from pos45 to pos23 would require moving up multiple times. But perhaps there's a smarter way.

Alternatively, maybe the agent can move from pos45 to pos44 (dirup), then pos43 (dirup?), but movement from pos44:

pos44 can go to pos34 (dirleft), pos54 (dirright), pos43 (dirup), pos45 (dirdown).

So from pos44, moving dirup to pos43. Then pos43 can go to pos33 (dirleft) or pos53 (dirright), etc.

But this seems complicated. Let's think of the required steps.

The stone is at pos32. We need to push it to pos53. The minimal path would involve moving right (dirright) to pos33, then right to pos43, then right to pos53. But how?

Wait, pushing from pos32 to pos33 (dirdown) requires the agent to be north of pos32. pos32's north is pos22. So the agent needs to be at pos22. Then, from pos22, they can push the stone to pos32's south (pos33). But how to get the agent to pos22?

The agent starts at pos45. To get to pos22:

pos45 → pos35 (dirleft)

pos35 → pos25 (dirleft)

pos25 → pos15 (dirleft) – but pos15 is clear. Then pos15 → pos25 via dirright? Wait, movement from pos25: can move to pos15 (dirleft), pos35 (dirright), pos24 (dirup), etc. Hmm, this path is going to take a lot of steps. But maybe there's a more efficient way.

Alternatively, maybe the agent can move up from pos45 to pos44, then pos44 to pos34, then pos34 to pos24, pos24 to pos23, etc.

Wait, let's consider the constraints. The agent must never be at pos41. So any path that avoids pos41 is okay. Also, pos52 must always be clear. So the agent can't go to pos52, and the stone can't be placed there.

Another constraint is that pos35 must not be clear at some state. That could be achieved by having the agent or the stone at pos35. Since the stone is moving to pos53, maybe the agent has to step on pos35. But the agent needs to be at pos44 before pos35 is occupied. So the agent must first visit pos44, then later go to pos35.

So, possible steps:

1. Agent moves from pos45 to pos44 (dirup). Now pos44 is occupied, pos45 is clear.

2. Then agent moves to pos34 (dirleft from pos44).

3. Then to pos33 (dirleft from pos34? No. From pos34, movement options are dirleft (pos24), dirright (pos44), dirup (pos33?), no. Let's check:

Movement from pos34: "You may move from location pos34 to location pos24 following direction dirleft", "You may move from location pos34 to location pos44 following direction dirright", "You may move from location pos34 to location pos33 following direction dirup", "You may move from location pos34 to location pos35 following direction dirdown".

So from pos34, the agent can go to pos24 (dirleft), pos44 (dirright), pos33 (dirup), or pos35 (dirdown). So after pos34, agent can go to pos33 (dirup). Then from pos33 to pos23 (dirleft), pos43 (dirright), etc.

But this seems a long way. Alternatively, after pos44, agent can move up to pos43, then pos43 to pos33, etc.

But perhaps a better approach is to first ensure that the constraint regarding pos35 is met. Let's plan to have the agent visit pos44 first, then later go to pos35, making pos35 not clear.

So steps could be:

- Agent moves from pos45 to pos44 (dirup). This satisfies the constraint that if pos35 is ever not clear, the agent was previously at pos44.

- Then, the agent moves to pos35. How? From pos44, move to pos34 (dirleft), then to pos35 (dirdown from pos34). Wait, from pos34, dirdown is pos35. So:

pos44 → pos34 (dirleft)

pos34 → pos35 (dirdown). Now, pos35 is occupied by the agent. This satisfies the first constraint (pos35 not clear) and ensures that the agent was at pos44 before.

But during this movement, the agent must not go to pos41, which is not a problem here. Also, pos52 must remain clear, which it is.

Now, after making pos35 occupied, the agent can proceed to move towards the stone at pos32.

But the stone is at pos32. So after dealing with the constraints, the agent needs to navigate to a position where they can push the stone towards pos53.

But let's think: after being at pos35, how can the agent get to pos32? From pos35, possible movements are dirleft (pos25), dirright (pos45), dirup (pos34). So from pos35, moving up to pos34, then to pos33, etc.

But this might complicate things. Alternatively, after fulfilling the constraint (pos35 not clear), maybe the agent can then move back to pos44, and proceed to push the stone.

But this seems like adding extra steps. Let's try to combine fulfilling the constraint with the main goal.

So, here's a possible plan:

1. Move agent from pos45 to pos44 (dirup). Now, pos44 is occupied, and agent is there.

2. Move agent from pos44 to pos34 (dirleft). Now at pos34.

3. Move agent from pos34 to pos35 (dirdown). Now, pos35 is occupied. This satisfies the first constraint (pos35 not clear) and the second (agent was at pos44 before).

Now, the agent is at pos35. Next, need to go towards the stone at pos32.

From pos35, the agent can move to pos34 (dirup), then to pos33 (dirup), then to pos32 (dirup). But wait, movement from pos34 to pos33 is via dirup? Let's check: movement from pos34 to pos33 is via dirup. Yes: "You may move from location pos34 to location pos33 following direction dirup".

So steps:

4. Move from pos35 to pos34 (dirup).

5. Move from pos34 to pos33 (dirup).

6. Move from pos33 to pos32 (dirup). But wait, from pos33, can we move to pos32? Let's check movement from pos33: "You may move from location pos33 to location pos23 following direction dirleft", "You may move from location pos33 to location pos43 following direction dirright", "You may move from location pos33 to location pos32 following direction dirup", "You may move from location pos33 to location pos34 following direction dirdown". So yes, step 6 is possible.

Now, the agent is at pos32. But the stone is at pos32, which is not clear. Wait, no: the initial state says "Location pos32 is clear", but the stone is at pos32. Wait, the initial state says "stone1 is at location pos32", but also "Location pos32 is clear". That seems contradictory. Wait, the initial state includes "Location pos32 is clear". But if the stone is at pos32, then the location is not clear. Wait, this must be a mistake. Let me check the problem statement again.

Looking back at the original state:

"player1 is at location pos45"

"stone1 is at location pos32"

"Location pos32 is clear"

Wait, that's impossible. A location can't have both a stone and be clear. So perhaps there's a mistake in the problem statement. Or maybe "clear" means something else, like no agent present? Because in the effects of actions, after moving, the agent's previous location becomes clear. So maybe "clear" refers to the agent not being there. So stones don't affect the "clear" status. That would make sense. So "Location pos32 is clear" means the agent is not there. The stone's presence doesn't block the "clear" status. So when the agent is at a location, it's not clear. Stones are separate.

So in the initial state, pos32 has stone1, but since the agent is not there, pos32 is clear. That's possible. So when pushing a stone, the stone's new location must be clear (no agent or stone there). Because the preconditions for push actions require that l_to is clear. So in the initial state, stone1 is at pos32, and pos32 is clear (no agent), which is allowed. So when pushing, the stone's current location is l_from (pos32), and l_to must be clear (no agent or stone). So the agent can push the stone from pos32 to another location as long as that location is clear.

But in this case, the stone is at pos32, and the agent is at pos45. The agent needs to get to a position adjacent to pos32 to push it.

But back to the plan. After step 6, the agent is at pos32. But pos32 has the stone. Wait, no: the stone is at pos32, and the agent is moving to pos32. But the preconditions for move require that the destination is clear. So moving to pos32 would require that pos32 is clear. But in the initial state, pos32 is clear (no agent), but the stone is there. So maybe "clear" means that there's no agent present, regardless of stones. So the agent can move to a location with a stone as long as it's clear (no agent). Wait, no, because if a stone is at a location, the agent can't be there. So perhaps "clear" refers to the agent not being there, and stones are considered objects that occupy the location but don't affect the "clear" status. That seems inconsistent, but given the problem statement, we have to work with it.

Alternatively, maybe "clear" means that neither the agent nor a stone is present. But in the initial state, pos32 has a stone, yet it's stated as clear. So that's a contradiction. Therefore, it must be that "clear" refers to the absence of the agent, and stones are considered separately. So a location can have a stone and be clear (no agent). That's the only way the initial state makes sense.

So when moving, the agent can move to a location that is clear (no agent), even if there's a stone there. But when pushing a stone, the destination (l_to) must be clear (no agent or stone), because the stone is being moved there. So in the preconditions for push actions, the l_to must be clear of any stone or agent.

So back to the plan. After step 6, the agent is trying to move to pos32, which has the stone. But according to the move action's preconditions, the agent can only move to a clear location. If pos32 has a stone, but is considered clear (since the agent is not there), then the agent can move there. Wait, but the move action's preconditions state that the destination (l_to) must be clear. If "clear" means no agent, then the agent can move to a location with a stone. But that seems odd. Alternatively, maybe "clear" means no agent or stone. But in that case, the initial state's "Location pos32 is clear" would be false, since the stone is there. Therefore, the problem statement must have a mistake. But given that the user provided the problem statement, I have to proceed with the information given.

Assuming that "clear" refers to the absence of the agent, then moving to pos32 is possible even if there's a stone there. But when pushing, the destination must have no stone or agent.

But in the initial state, stone1 is at pos32. So to push it, the agent needs to be adjacent to pos32 in some direction and then push.

Wait, but according to the initial state, the stone is at pos32, and the agent is at pos45. The agent needs to reach a position adjacent to pos32 to push it.

So after step 6, the agent is at pos32. But if the agent is at pos32, then pos32 is not clear anymore. But the stone is also there. That's conflicting. So perhaps the agent and stone cannot occupy the same location. Therefore, the initial problem statement must have an error. But given that the user provided it, perhaps "clear" only refers to the agent's presence, and stones are separate.

But this is confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the initial state's "Location pos32 is clear" is a mistake, and the stone being there makes it not clear. But the user included both "stone1 is at pos32" and "Location pos32 is clear". So perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the problem's representation.

Assuming that the user intended that stones do not block the "clear" status (i.e., "clear" means no agent is present), then the agent can move to a location with a stone as long as it's clear (no agent). But when the agent moves there, the location becomes not clear. But the stone is still there. That seems odd, but perhaps that's how it's modeled.

In that case, the agent could move to pos32, which has the stone. But then, pushing the stone would require the agent to be adjacent. Alternatively, perhaps the agent can't be at the same location as the stone. But the problem statement's actions don't mention anything about that. The pushtogoal action requires the agent to be at l_p, which is adjacent to l_from (the stone's location).

So, for example, to push the stone from pos32 to pos33 (dirdown), the agent must be at l_p, which is pos32's dirup, which is pos22. Wait, because to move from l_p to l_from (pos32), following direction d. So if the direction is dirdown, then l_p is pos22 (since moving dirdown from pos22 to pos32). So the agent must be at pos22.

So to perform a pushtogoal action from pos32 to pos33, the agent must be at pos22. Then, they push the stone down to pos33.

So the agent needs to move from pos45 to pos22. Let's map that path.

Current agent position after step 3: pos35.

From pos35, the agent can move dirup to pos34.

pos34 → pos33 (dirup)

pos33 → pos23 (dirleft)

pos23 → pos22 (dirup)

Now, the agent is at pos22. Then, they can perform the pushtogoal action:

pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos32 pos33 dirdown

Preconditions check:

(i) agent is at pos22: yes.

(ii) stone is at pos32: yes.

(iii) pos33 is clear: initially, yes.

(iv) can move from pos22 to pos32 via dirdown: yes, according to the movement rules.

(v) can move from pos32 to pos33 via dirdown: yes.

(vi) pos33 is a goal location? No. pos53 is the only goal. So this action can't be pushtogoal, because pos33 is not a goal. So we have to use pushtonongoal here.

But the goal is to get the stone to pos53, which is a goal. So after pushing to pos33, which is not a goal, we need to push it further.

So after pushing to pos33, then to pos43, then to pos53.

But let's see:

After pushing to pos33 (non-goal), the stone is there. Then the agent is at pos32 (since after pushing, the agent moves from pos22 to pos32).

Wait, the effect of pushtonongoal is:

- agent is no longer at pos22.

- stone is no longer at pos32.

- pos33 is no longer clear.

- agent is at pos32.

- stone is at pos33.

- pos22 becomes clear.

So after this action, the agent is at pos32, stone is at pos33.

Then, the agent can push the stone from pos33 to pos43 (dirright). For that, the agent needs to be at pos33's dirleft, which is pos23.

But the agent is at pos32. So how to get to pos23?

From pos32, the agent can move to pos22 (dirleft), then to pos23 (dirdown).

Wait, movement from pos32 to pos22 is dirleft, which is allowed. Then from pos22 to pos23 is dirdown (since "You may move from location pos22 to location pos23 following direction dirdown"). So:

Agent at pos32 → pos22 (dirleft)

Then pos22 → pos23 (dirdown)

Then, perform pushtonongoal to push stone1 from pos33 to pos43 (dirright).

But for that, the agent needs to be at pos33's dirleft (pos23), which they are. Then, direction dirright allows moving from pos23 to pos33 (dirright?) Wait, according to movement rules:

From pos23, "You may move from location pos23 to location pos13 following direction dirleft", "You may move from location pos23 to location pos33 following direction dirright", "You may move from location pos23 to location pos22 following direction dirup", "You may move from location pos23 to location pos24 following direction dirdown".

So direction dirright from pos23 to pos33. So the agent is at pos23, stone is at pos33. To push it to pos43, direction dirright requires that from pos33 to pos43 is possible via dirright. From pos33, movement to pos43 is via dirright: "You may move from location pos33 to location pos43 following direction dirright". So yes.

So the action would be pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos33 pos43 dirright.

Preconditions:

(i) agent is at pos23: yes.

(ii) stone is at pos33: yes.

(iii) pos43 is clear: initially, yes.

(iv) can move from pos23 to pos33 via dirright: yes.

(v) can move from pos33 to pos43 via dirright: yes.

(vi) pos43 is not a goal: correct, pos53 is the only goal.

After this action, the agent moves to pos33, stone moves to pos43.

Now, the agent is at pos33, stone at pos43. Next, push to pos53.

To push from pos43 to pos53, direction dirright. The agent needs to be at pos43's dirleft (pos33), which is where the agent is after the previous action.

So the next action would be pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos43 pos53 dirright.

Check preconditions:

(i) agent is at pos33: yes.

(ii) stone is at pos43: yes.

(iii) pos53 is clear: yes.

(iv) can move from pos33 to pos43 via dirright: yes.

(v) can move from pos43 to pos53 via dirright: yes.

(vi) pos53 is a goal: yes.

This action is valid.

After this, the stone is at pos53, which is the goal.

Now, let's check the constraints:

- The first constraint: pos35 must not be clear in at least one state. Earlier steps had the agent at pos35 (step 3), so pos35 was not clear then. The agent was at pos44 in step 1, which is before step 3. So this satisfies the first two constraints.

- The agent never visits pos41. The path taken is pos45 → pos44 → pos34 → pos35 → pos34 → pos33 → pos32 → pos22 → pos23 → pos33 → pos43 → pos53. None of these are pos41, so that's good.

- pos52 is always clear. The agent never goes there, and the stone is moved from pos32 → pos33 → pos43 → pos53. So pos52 remains clear.

So this plan should work.

Putting it all together:

1. Move from pos45 to pos44 (dirup).

2. Move from pos44 to pos34 (dirleft).

3. Move from pos34 to pos35 (dirdown). Now, pos35 is occupied.

4. Move from pos35 to pos34 (dirup).

5. Move from pos34 to pos33 (dirup).

6. Move from pos33 to pos32 (dirup). But wait, can the agent move to pos32? Because pos32 has the stone, but if "clear" means no agent, then pos32 is clear (since the stone is there but the agent isn't). But after moving to pos32, the agent would be there, making it not clear. However, the move action's precondition requires that l_to is clear. So if pos32 has a stone but is considered clear (no agent), then this move is allowed.

But according to the initial state, pos32 is clear, but the stone is there. So perhaps the presence of a stone doesn't affect the clear status. So the agent can move to pos32.

Wait, but after moving, the agent is at pos32, so pos32 is no longer clear. The stone is there, but perhaps stones don't affect the clear status. So moving to pos32 is allowed.

But then, after step 6, the agent is at pos32, and the stone is also there. Is that possible? According to the problem's semantics, can the agent and stone occupy the same location? The actions don't mention anything about that. But in the push actions, the agent moves to the stone's previous location, implying that after the push, the agent is where the stone was, and the stone is moved. So during a push, the agent and stone are never in the same location.

But in a move action, perhaps the agent can move to a location with a stone, as long as it's considered clear (no agent). This seems contradictory, but given the problem statement, we have to proceed.

Assuming that the agent can move to pos32 (even with the stone there), then step 6 is possible. Then, the agent is at pos32. But then, how to push the stone? The agent needs to be adjacent to the stone's location to push it. But if the agent is at the same location as the stone, they can't push. So perhaps step 6 is not valid.

This suggests that the agent cannot move to pos32 if the stone is there. Therefore, the earlier plan is flawed.

Alternative approach: instead of moving to pos32, the agent needs to get to a position adjacent to pos32 to push it.

So revisiting the plan:

After step 3 (agent at pos35), how to get to a position where they can push the stone.

From pos35, the agent can move to pos34 (dirup), then to pos33 (dirup), then to pos23 (dirleft), then to pos22 (dirup). Then, from pos22, push the stone to pos32's south (pos33).

Wait, but the stone is at pos32. To push it south to pos33, the agent needs to be north of pos32 (pos22), pushing down.

So let's plan:

1. Move from pos45 to pos44 (dirup).

2. Move from pos44 to pos34 (dirleft).

3. Move from pos34 to pos35 (dirdown). Now, pos35 is occupied (fulfills constraint).

4. Move from pos35 to pos34 (dirup).

5. Move from pos34 to pos33 (dirup).

6. Move from pos33 to pos23 (dirleft).

7. Move from pos23 to pos22 (dirup).

Now, agent is at pos22. Can push the stone from pos32 to pos33 (dirdown).

Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos32 pos33 dirdown.

Preconditions:

- Agent is at pos22: yes.

- Stone is at pos32: yes.

- pos33 is clear: yes.

- Can move from pos22 to pos32 via dirdown: yes.

- Can move from pos32 to pos33 via dirdown: yes.

- pos33 is not a goal: yes.

Effects:

- Agent moves to pos32.

- Stone moves to pos33.

- pos33 is no longer clear.

Now, agent is at pos32, stone at pos33.

Next, push the stone from pos33 to pos43 (dirright).

Agent needs to be at pos33's dirleft (pos23).

But agent is at pos32. Need to move to pos23.

Path from pos32:

8. Move from pos32 to pos22 (dirleft).

9. Move from pos22 to pos23 (dirdown).

Now, agent is at pos23.

Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos33 pos43 dirright.

Preconditions:

- Agent at pos23: yes.

- Stone at pos33: yes.

- pos43 is clear: yes.

- Can move from pos23 to pos33 via dirright: yes.

- Can move from pos33 to pos43 via dirright: yes.

- pos43 is not a goal: yes.

Effects:

- Agent moves to pos33.

- Stone moves to pos43.

Now, agent is at pos33, stone at pos43.

Next, push to pos53 (dirright).

Agent needs to be at pos43's dirleft (pos33), which they are.

Action: pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos43 pos53 dirright.

Preconditions:

- Agent at pos33: yes.

- Stone at pos43: yes.

- pos53 is clear: yes.

- Can move from pos33 to pos43 via dirright: yes.

- Can move from pos43 to pos53 via dirright: yes.

- pos53 is a goal: yes.

Effects:

- Agent moves to pos43.

- Stone moves to pos53.

Now, stone is at pos53, goal achieved.

Check constraints:

- pos35 was occupied in step 3, and agent was at pos44 in step 1 before that.

- Agent never visited pos41.

- pos52 remained clear throughout.

This plan should work.

Counting the steps:

1. move player1 pos45 pos44 dirup

2. move player1 pos44 pos34 dirleft

3. move player1 pos34 pos35 dirdown

4. move player1 pos35 pos34 dirup

5. move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup

6. move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft

7. move player1 pos23 pos22 dirup

8. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos32 pos33 dirdown

9. move player1 pos32 pos22 dirleft

10. move player1 pos22 pos23 dirdown

11. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos33 pos43 dirright

12. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos43 pos53 dirright

Wait, but steps 9 and 10 may not be necessary. After step 8, the agent is at pos32. To get to pos23, the agent needs to move from pos32 to pos22 (dirleft), then to pos23 (dirdown). So steps 9 and 10 are needed.

But maybe there's a shorter path. Let me check.

After step 8, agent is at pos32. Can they move directly to pos23 from pos32?

Movement from pos32: allowed moves are to pos22 (dirleft), pos42 (dirright), pos31 (dirup), pos33 (dirdown). So no, from pos32, the agent can't go directly to pos23. So steps 9 and 10 are necessary.

But this makes the plan quite long. Is there a way to optimize?

Alternative approach after step 8:

Agent is at pos32. Instead of moving to pos22, can they push the stone again? The stone is now at pos33. But the agent is at pos32. To push the stone from pos33 to pos43, the agent needs to be at pos33's dirleft (pos23), but the agent is at pos32. So they can't push directly. Hence, steps 9 and 10 are needed.

So the total number of actions is 12. But maybe there's a shorter path.

Wait, perhaps after step 3 (agent at pos35), instead of moving to pos34, then pos33, etc., maybe the agent can take a different route to pos22.

From pos35, can the agent move to pos25 (dirleft), then pos24 (dirup), pos23 (dirleft), etc.?

For example:

3. After moving to pos35, move to pos25 (dirleft).

4. pos25 → pos24 (dirup).

5. pos24 → pos23 (dirleft).

6. pos23 → pos22 (dirup).

Then proceed to push from pos22.

This would require steps:

1. move pos45 to pos44 (dirup)

2. move pos44 to pos34 (dirleft)

3. move pos34 to pos35 (dirdown) → pos35 occupied

4. move pos35 to pos25 (dirleft)

5. move pos25 to pos24 (dirup)

6. move pos24 to pos23 (dirleft)

7. move pos23 to pos22 (dirup)

8. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos32 pos33 dirdown

Then proceed as before.

But this path is also long. Let's count the steps:

Steps 1-7: 7 moves.

Then push: 8.

Then from pos32 to pos22 (dirleft): 9.

 pos22 → pos23 (dirdown): 10.

Then push: 11.

Then push to pos53: 12.

Same number of steps.

Alternatively, after step 3 (pos35), maybe the agent can move to pos34 (dirup), then to pos24 (dirleft), then to pos23 (dirup), then to pos22.

But that's similar to the previous path.

It seems that regardless of the path, the number of steps will be similar. But the user requests an optimal plan with minimal length. So is there a shorter way?

Alternative idea: after fulfilling the pos35 constraint, the agent can move directly from pos35 to pos25, then to pos15, etc., but that's not helpful.

Another approach: after the agent is at pos44 (step 1), instead of going to pos34 and pos35, maybe use a different route to reach pos22.

From pos44, the agent can move to pos43 (dirup), then pos33 (dirleft), then pos23 (dirleft), then pos22 (dirup).

But that would be:

1. move pos45 → pos44 (dirup)

2. move pos44 → pos43 (dirup)

3. move pos43 → pos33 (dirleft)

4. move pos33 → pos23 (dirleft)

5. move pos23 → pos22 (dirup)

Then push stone from pos22 to pos32.

But then, how to fulfill the constraint that pos35 is not clear. Because in this path, the agent hasn't visited pos35. So they need to make sure pos35 is not clear at some point.

So perhaps combine the two paths: fulfill the pos35 constraint and then proceed.

But this complicates the steps. The minimal plan would require fulfilling the constraint first, then pushing the stone.

But perhaps the pushtogoal action can be used to fulfill the constraint. For example, if the stone is pushed to pos35, but pos35 is not a goal. But that would require using pushtonongoal to pos35, which is allowed. But pos35 is not a goal, so pushing the stone there wouldn't help the goal, but could fulfill the constraint. However, the stone needs to eventually reach pos53. So this may not be useful.

Alternatively, have the agent move to pos35, making it not clear, then proceed to push the stone.

So the initial steps are:

1. move pos45 → pos44 (dirup)

2. move pos44 → pos34 (dirleft)

3. move pos34 → pos35 (dirdown) → pos35 not clear

Then proceed to move back to pos34, pos33, pos23, pos22, then push.

But this seems necessary to fulfill the constraint.

So the minimal plan would have to include steps to move the agent to pos35, then proceed to push the stone.

Given that, the earlier plan with 12 steps may be the shortest possible.

But perhaps there's a way to optimize.

Wait, after step 3 (agent at pos35), instead of moving back to pos34, maybe the agent can move to pos35 → pos25 → pos24 → pos23 → pos22, then push.

But that's more steps.

Alternatively, after step 3 (pos35), move to pos34 → pos33 → pos32, then push the stone from pos32 to pos33, but the agent is already at pos32. But then, how to push.

Alternatively, after step 3, the agent can go to pos34 → pos33 → pos43 → pos53, but that doesn't help with the stone.

Hmm, this is tricky. Given the complexity, perhaps the initial plan with 12 steps is the minimal. However, perhaps there's a shorter path.

Alternative plan:

1. move player1 pos45 pos44 dirup

2. move player1 pos44 pos34 dirleft

3. move player1 pos34 pos35 dirdown (now pos35 is not clear)

4. move player1 pos35 pos34 dirup

5. move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup

6. move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft

7. move player1 pos23 pos22 dirup

8. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos32 pos33 dirdown

9. move player1 pos32 pos22 dirleft

10. move player1 pos22 pos23 dirdown

11. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos33 pos43 dirright

12. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos43 pos53 dirright

Total of 12 actions.

But maybe steps 9 and 10 can be avoided by pushing directly from pos32.

Wait, after step 8, the agent is at pos32. Then, can they push the stone from pos33 to pos43?

The stone is at pos33. To push it to pos43, the agent needs to be at pos33's dirleft (pos23), but the agent is at pos32. So they need to move to pos23. So steps 9 and 10 are necessary.

Therefore, this seems to be the minimal plan.

But wait, perhaps after step 8, the agent can move from pos32 to pos33 (dirdown), but pos33 is occupied by the stone. So the move would not be possible, as the destination is not clear. So no.

Therefore, the plan as outlined is necessary.

But the user requests an optimal plan with minimal length. Is there a shorter way?

Alternative idea: can the agent reach pos22 without going through pos35?

For example:

1. move pos45 → pos44 (dirup)

2. move pos44 → pos34 (dirleft)

3. move pos34 → pos24 (dirleft)

4. move pos24 → pos23 (dirleft)

5. move pos23 → pos22 (dirup)

6. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos32 pos33 dirdown

7. move player1 pos32 pos22 dirleft

8. move player1 pos22 pos23 dirdown

9. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos33 pos43 dirright

10. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos43 pos53 dirright

This is 10 actions. However, this plan does not fulfill the first constraint that pos35 is not clear in some state. So this plan is invalid.

Thus, the earlier plan is necessary to include steps to make pos35 not clear.

Therefore, the minimal valid plan must include steps to visit pos44 and pos35.

Thus, the plan with 12 steps is necessary. But perhaps there's a smarter way to fulfill the constraint.

Wait, maybe the agent can push the stone to pos35. For example, after moving to pos34, push the stone to pos34 → pos35. But the stone is at pos32. To push it to pos35, the agent would need to be in a position to push it south-east, but the directions may not allow that.

Alternatively, push the stone from pos32 to pos42 (dirright), requiring the agent to be at pos32's dirleft (pos22), but that would move the stone to pos42, which is not helpful towards the goal.

Alternatively, perhaps push the stone to pos35. But pos35 is not a goal, so the stone would need to be moved again. This would add steps, but might allow fulfilling the constraint.

But this seems less efficient. The original plan is better.

Final plan:

```
move player1 pos45 pos44 dirup
move player1 pos44 pos34 dirleft
move player1 pos34 pos35 dirdown
move player1 pos35 pos34 dirup
move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup
move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft
move player1 pos23 pos22 dirup
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos32 pos33 dirdown
move player1 pos32 pos22 dirleft
move player1 pos22 pos23 dirdown
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos33 pos43 dirright
pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos43 pos53 dirright
```

Wait, there's a typo in the last action: pushtogoal, not pushtogoal. Also, need to check the syntax.

But the last action should be "pushtogoal" with the correct arguments.

So the correct actions are:

```
move player1 pos45 pos44 dirup
move player1 pos44 pos34 dirleft
move player1 pos34 pos35 dirdown
move player1 pos35 pos34 dirup
move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup
move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft
move player1 pos23 pos22 dirup
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos32 pos33 dirdown
move player1 pos32 pos22 dirleft
move player1 pos22 pos23 dirdown
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos33 pos43 dirright
pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos43 pos53 dirright
```

This plan has 12 actions. But perhaps there's a shorter way. For example, after step 3 (agent at pos35), maybe they can move directly to pos25, then to pos24, etc., but that's longer.

Alternatively, after step 3, agent is at pos35. Then move to pos34 (step4), then to pos33 (step5), then to pos23 (step6), pos22 (step7), then push (step8). Then steps 9 and 10 to get to pos23 again. Steps 8-12 are necessary.

I think this is the minimal plan considering the constraints.
