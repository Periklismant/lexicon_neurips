Let's understand the problem:

1. We have a 2D square grid (5x5 in this case).
2. Each position can contain the agent, a stone, or be empty.
3. Each position is either a goal or non-goal position.
4. The objective is to move all stones to goal positions. Here, we only have one stone: stone1.
5. The available actions are:
   - move: Move the agent from one location to another.
   - pushtogoal: Make the agent push a stone to a goal location.
   - pushtonongoal: Make the agent push a stone to a non-goal location.

Let's analyze the initial state:
- player1 is at pos55
- stone1 is at pos24
- pos41 is the only goal location. So, the task is to move stone1 to pos41.
- We have a 5x5 grid, where position pos(i,j) corresponds to the coordinates (i, j).

There are also constraints:
1. At some point, pos41 should not be clear. This is likely to happen when stone1 is moved to pos41, fulfilling the goal.
2. After pos41 is not clear, player1 must be at pos14 or pos12 at some state.
3. At some point, pos45 should not be clear.
4. Before pos45 is not clear, either pos11 should not be clear or stone1 should be at pos35.
5. At some point, both pos42 and pos54 should not be clear simultaneously.

Let's think about the plan:
- The goal is to move stone1 from pos24 to pos41.
- To push stone1, player1 needs to be adjacent to it.
- player1 starts at pos55 and stone1 starts at pos24.

First, player1 needs to get to a position adjacent to stone1 (pos24). Since pushing occurs along a direction, player1 has to be at one of: pos14, pos34, pos23, or pos25.

Given that the goal location is pos41, which is to the right of pos31, we'll need to push stone1 from the left (stone1 should be at pos31 and player1 at pos21 to push it to pos41). Let's think about a path to get there:

First, player1 needs to move from pos55 to a position adjacent to stone1 (pos24). Given the constraints, let's try to devise a plan:

1. player1 starts at pos55.
2. To move player1 to a position adjacent to stone1 (which is at pos24), we need player1 to reach one of: pos14, pos34, pos23, or pos25.
3. Once in position, player1 can push stone1 to move it.
4. We want stone1 to reach pos41, which is a goal location.
5. To get stone1 to pos41, we need to eventually position it at pos31 and then push it to pos41.

Let's try to visualize the grid to make this clearer:

```
     1  2  3  4  5
1    .  .  .  .  .
2    .  .  .  S  .
3    .  .  .  .  .
4    G  .  .  .  .
5    .  .  .  .  P
```

Here:
- P is player1 (at pos55)
- S is stone1 (at pos24)
- G is the goal location (pos41)
- The notation pos(i,j) refers to position (j, i) in this grid.

Our aim is to move stone1 (S) to the goal location (G).

Now, let's tackle the problem considering the constraints:

1. player1 starts at pos55.
2. We need to move player1 to a position adjacent to stone1 (pos24), e.g., pos34.
3. Then, we want to push stone1 towards pos41, which means we need to get it to pos31 first and then push it to pos41.

Let's start planning:

1. Move player1 from pos55 to pos34 (this would be a series of move actions).
2. Push stone1 from pos24 to pos14.
3. Move player1 to pos13.
4. Push stone1 from pos14 to pos13.
5. Move player1 to pos12.
6. Push stone1 from pos13 to pos12.
7. Move player1 to pos11.
8. Push stone1 from pos12 to pos11.
9. Move player1 to pos21.
10. Push stone1 from pos11 to pos21.
11. Move player1 to pos31.
12. Push stone1 from pos21 to pos31.
13. Move player1 to pos41.
14. Push stone1 from pos31 to pos41 (the goal).

Let's see if this plan satisfies the constraints:

1. At some point, pos41 is not clear (when stone1 is there).
2. After pos41 is not clear, player1 should be at pos14 or pos12. In our plan, after pushing stone1 to pos41, player1 will be at pos31. We need to adjust our plan to ensure player1 ends up at pos14 or pos12.
3. At some point, pos45 should not be clear. Our plan doesn't address this.
4. Before pos45 is not clear, either pos11 should not be clear or stone1 should be at pos35. Our plan does have stone1 at pos11, but it doesn't have anything at pos45 or stone1 at pos35.
5. At some point, both pos42 and pos54 should not be clear simultaneously. Our plan doesn't address this.

We need to revise our plan to meet all constraints. Let's think...

Let's adjust our plan to ensure all constraints are met:

I need to satisfy the constraints. Let me try to think how to satisfy them:

1. The constraint "Location pos41 is not clear" will be satisfied when we push stone1 to pos41.
2. The constraint "After pos41 is not clear, player1 should be at pos14 or pos12" means that after pushing stone1 to pos41, we need to move player1 to either pos14 or pos12. We can ensure player1 goes to pos14.
3. The constraint "At some point, pos45 should not be clear" means that at some point, either player1 or stone1 should be at pos45.
4. The constraint "Before pos45 is not clear, either pos11 should not be clear or stone1 should be at pos35" means that before we place something at pos45, we need to ensure that either pos11 is occupied or stone1 is at pos35.
5. The constraint "At some point, both pos42 and pos54 should not be clear simultaneously" means that at some point, both pos42 and pos54 should be occupied.

Let's revise our plan:

1. From pos55, move player1 to pos11 (to satisfy constraint 4, making pos11 not clear). (This will be a series of move actions).
2. Move player1 from pos11 to pos45 (to satisfy constraint 3, making pos45 not clear).
3. Move player1 from pos45 to pos34 (to get adjacent to stone1).
4. Push stone1 from pos24 to pos34 (to get stone1 moving towards the goal).
5. Move player1 to pos35.
6. Push stone1 from pos34 to pos35 (to satisfy constraint 4, having stone1 at pos35).
7. Move player1 to pos45 (again making pos45 not clear, satisfying constraint 3).
8. Move player1 to pos54.
9. Move player1 to pos42 (now player1 is at pos42).
10. Now, we need to get stone1 from pos35 to pos41. 
11. To satisfy constraint 5, we need both pos42 (where player1 is now) and pos54 to be not clear simultaneously. So, we need to move stone1 to pos54. From pos35, we push it to pos45, then push it to pos55, then push it to pos54.
12. Then, we move stone1 towards the goal (pos41). We'll need to push it from pos54 to pos44, then to pos34, then to pos33, then to pos32, then to pos31, and finally to pos41.
13. After pushing stone1 to pos41, to satisfy constraint 2, player1 should move to pos14 or pos12. Let's say player1 moves to pos14.

This sounds very complex. Let's try to outline the specific actions step by step:

Player1 starts at pos55 and stone1 starts at pos24.

First, let's move player1 to pos11 to satisfy constraint 4:
1. move player1 pos55 pos45 dirleft
2. move player1 pos45 pos35 dirleft
3. move player1 pos35 pos25 dirleft
4. move player1 pos25 pos15 dirleft
5. move player1 pos15 pos14 dirup
6. move player1 pos14 pos13 dirup
7. move player1 pos13 pos12 dirup
8. move player1 pos12 pos11 dirup

Now, move player1 to pos45 to satisfy constraint 3:
9. move player1 pos11 pos12 dirdown
10. move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown
11. move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown
12. move player1 pos14 pos15 dirdown
13. move player1 pos15 pos25 dirright
14. move player1 pos25 pos35 dirright
15. move player1 pos35 pos45 dirright

Now, move player1 to get adjacent to stone1 at pos24:
16. move player1 pos45 pos35 dirleft
17. move player1 pos35 pos34 dirup

Now, push stone1 to pos34:
18. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos24 pos34 dirright (pushing stone1 from pos24 to pos34 from position pos34, following direction dirright)

Now, move player1 to pos35:
19. move player1 pos24 pos25 dirdown
20. move player1 pos25 pos35 dirright

Now, push stone1 to pos35 (to satisfy constraint 4):
21. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos35 pos34 pos35 dirdown (pushing stone1 from pos34 to pos35 from position pos35, following direction dirdown)

Move player1 to pos45 (to satisfy constraint 3 again):
22. move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright
23. move player1 pos44 pos45 dirdown

Move player1 to pos54:
24. move player1 pos45 pos55 dirright
25. move player1 pos55 pos54 dirup

Move player1 to pos42 (to prepare for constraint 5):
26. move player1 pos54 pos44 dirleft
27. move player1 pos44 pos43 dirup
28. move player1 pos43 pos42 dirup

Now, to satisfy constraint 5 (both pos42 and pos54 not clear simultaneously), we need to move stone1 to pos54. First, move player1 to get adjacent to stone1 at pos35:
29. move player1 pos42 pos43 dirdown
30. move player1 pos43 pos44 dirdown
31. move player1 pos44 pos34 dirleft

Push stone1 towards pos54:
32. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos35 pos45 dirright (pushing stone1 from pos35 to pos45 from position pos34, following direction dirright)
33. move player1 pos35 pos45 dirright
34. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos45 pos45 pos55 dirright (pushing stone1 from pos45 to pos55 from position pos45, following direction dirright)
35. move player1 pos45 pos55 dirright
36. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos55 pos55 pos54 dirup (pushing stone1 from pos55 to pos54 from position pos55, following direction dirup)

At this point, stone1 is at pos54 and player1 is at pos55. Player1 is also at pos42, so both pos42 and pos54 are not clear simultaneously (satisfying constraint 5).

Next, we need to move stone1 towards the goal (pos41). First, push it from pos54 to pos44:
37. move player1 pos55 pos45 dirleft
38. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos45 pos54 pos44 dirleft (pushing stone1 from pos54 to pos44 from position pos45, following direction dirleft)

Mmm, wait. I realized that an agent can only be at one position at a time. There's no agent "already at" pos42 in the plan above. Let me rethink the approach for constraint 5.

So for constraint 5, "At some point, both pos42 and pos54 should not be clear simultaneously," this means we need player1 to be at one of these positions and stone1 at the other position, or stone1 at both positions (which isn't possible), or something else at these positions (which we don't have). 

Alright, let me revise the plan to ensure constraint 5 is met:

Let's assume we want player1 to be at pos42 and stone1 at pos54 at some point, to satisfy constraint 5. And then we move stone1 to the goal (pos41).

So, let's restart with a clearer plan:

Player1 starts at pos55 and stone1 starts at pos24.

First, let's move player1 to pos11 to satisfy constraint 4:
1. move player1 pos55 pos45 dirleft
2. move player1 pos45 pos35 dirleft
3. move player1 pos35 pos25 dirleft
4. move player1 pos25 pos15 dirleft
5. move player1 pos15 pos14 dirup
6. move player1 pos14 pos13 dirup
7. move player1 pos13 pos12 dirup
8. move player1 pos12 pos11 dirup

Now, move player1 to pos45 to satisfy constraint 3:
9. move player1 pos11 pos12 dirdown
10. move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown
11. move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown
12. move player1 pos14 pos15 dirdown
13. move player1 pos15 pos25 dirright
14. move player1 pos25 pos35 dirright
15. move player1 pos35 pos45 dirright

Now, we have satisfied constraints 3 and 4. Let's address constraint 5:

We need both pos42 and pos54 to be not clear simultaneously. Let's have player1 at pos42 and stone1 at pos54. First, move player1 to pos42:
16. move player1 pos45 pos44 dirup
17. move player1 pos44 pos43 dirup
18. move player1 pos43 pos42 dirup

Now, let's move stone1 to pos54. First, get player1 adjacent to stone1:
19. move player1 pos42 pos32 dirleft
20. move player1 pos32 pos33 dirdown
21. move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown
22. move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft
23. move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup

Now, push stone1 towards pos54:
24. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos24 pos34 dirright (pushing stone1 from pos24 to pos34 from position pos23, following direction dirright)
25. move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright
26. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos34 pos44 dirright (pushing stone1 from pos34 to pos44 from position pos34, following direction dirright)
27. move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright
28. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos44 pos54 dirright (pushing stone1 from pos44 to pos54 from position pos44, following direction dirright)

Wait, I just realized I can't execute steps 26 and 28 correctly, since after pushing player1 will end up in the position where stone1 was, and I'll need to move player1 again.

Let me redo it. I'll just go through the actions step by step:

24. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos24 pos34 dirright (pushing stone1 from pos24 to pos34 from position pos23, following direction dirright)
25. move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright
26. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos34 pos44 dirright (pushing stone1 from pos34 to pos44 from position pos34, following direction dirright)
27. move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright
28. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos44 pos54 dirright (pushing stone1 from pos44 to pos54 from position pos44, following direction dirright)

But let me carefully check what happens after each step:
24. player1 is at pos24, stone1 is at pos34
25. player1 is at pos34, stone1 is at pos34. Wait, this is a contradiction. There's a misunderstanding in how the "pushtonongoal" action works.

Let's revisit the action descriptions:

"pushtonongoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": Make agent p, situated at location l_p, push stone s from location l_from to non-goal location l_to, following direction d.

And its preconditions:
"pushtonongoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": You may only perform this action if
(i) agent p is at location l_p,
(ii) stone s is at location l_from,
(iii) location l_to is clear,
(iv) you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d,
(v) you can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d, and
(vi) location l_to is not a goal location.

And its effects:
"pushtonongoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": After performing this action,
(i) agent p is no longer at location l_p,
(ii) stone s is no longer at location l_from,
(iii) location l_to is no longer clear,
(iv) agent p is at location l_from,
(v) stone s is at location l_to,
(vi) location l_p is clear, and
(vi) stone s is at a non goal state.

So if agent p is at location l_p, and it pushes stone s from location l_from to location l_to, then after the action:
- agent p is no longer at l_p, but at l_from.
- stone s is no longer at l_from, but at l_to.

Let me redo my actions:

1. Let's start by moving player1 from pos55 to get to pos23 (next to stone1):
   move player1 pos55 pos45 dirleft
   move player1 pos45 pos35 dirleft
   move player1 pos35 pos25 dirleft
   move player1 pos25 pos24 dirup
   move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup

2. Now, push stone1 from pos24 to pos14:
   pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos24 pos14 dirleft (The agent is on pos23, pushes stone1 from pos24 to pos14, following direction dirleft. After this action, player1 is at pos24 and stone1 is at pos14.)

3. Move player1 to pos11, making pos11 not clear (to satisfy constraint 4):
   move player1 pos24 pos14 dirleft
   move player1 pos14 pos13 dirup
   move player1 pos13 pos12 dirup
   move player1 pos12 pos11 dirup

4. Move player1 to pos45, making pos45 not clear (to satisfy constraint 3):
   move player1 pos11 pos12 dirdown
   move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown
   move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown
   move player1 pos14 pos15 dirdown
   move player1 pos15 pos25 dirright
   move player1 pos25 pos35 dirright
   move player1 pos35 pos45 dirright

5. To satisfy constraint 5, we need both pos42 and pos54 to be not clear simultaneously. Let's move player1 to pos42 and stone1 to pos54. First, move player1 to pos42:
   move player1 pos45 pos44 dirup
   move player1 pos44 pos43 dirup
   move player1 pos43 pos42 dirup

6. Now, get stone1 from pos14 to pos54:
   move player1 pos42 pos32 dirleft
   move player1 pos32 pos22 dirleft
   move player1 pos22 pos12 dirleft
   move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown
   move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown
   pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos14 pos14 pos24 dirright (After this, player1 is at pos14 and stone1 is at pos24.)
   move player1 pos14 pos24 dirright
   pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos24 pos34 dirright (After this, player1 is at pos24 and stone1 is at pos34.)
   move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright
   pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos34 pos44 dirright (After this, player1 is at pos34 and stone1 is at pos44.)
   move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright
   pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos44 pos54 dirright (After this, player1 is at pos44 and stone1 is at pos54.)

   Now, constraint 5 is satisfied because player1 is at pos42 and stone1 is at pos54, making both locations not clear simultaneously.

7. Now, let's move stone1 to the goal (pos41):
   move player1 pos44 pos43 dirup
   move player1 pos43 pos42 dirup
   move player1 pos42 pos41 dirleft (not actually a position we can reach from the previous one, need to think more about this)

Wait, that last step is incorrect. pos41 is a goal location, not just any position. Let me rethink this part. We need to move stone1 from pos54 to pos41.
   
In Step 6, after player1 pushes stone1 to pos54, player1 is at pos44, and stone1 is at pos54. No, I'm confused again. Let me slow down.

After moving player1 to pos42 and stone1 to pos54, constraint 5 is satisfied. Now, we need to push stone1 to the goal (pos41):
- stone1 is at pos54, and we want to get it to pos41.
- We need to move it down (to pos53, pos52, pos51) and then left (to pos41).

Let me revise the actions:

1. Let's start by moving player1 from pos55 to get to pos23 (next to stone1):
   move player1 pos55 pos45 dirleft
   move player1 pos45 pos35 dirleft
   move player1 pos35 pos25 dirleft
   move player1 pos25 pos24 dirup
   move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup

2. Now, push stone1 from pos24 to pos14:
   pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos24 pos14 dirleft (The agent is on pos23, pushes stone1 from pos24 to pos14, following direction dirleft. After this action, player1 is at pos24 and stone1 is at pos14.)

3. Move player1 to pos11, making pos11 not clear (to satisfy constraint 4):
   move player1 pos24 pos14 dirleft
   move player1 pos14 pos13 dirup
   move player1 pos13 pos12 dirup
   move player1 pos12 pos11 dirup

4. Move player1 to pos45, making pos45 not clear (to satisfy constraint 3):
   move player1 pos11 pos12 dirdown
   move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown
   move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown
   move player1 pos14 pos15 dirdown
   move player1 pos15 pos25 dirright
   move player1 pos25 pos35 dirright
   move player1 pos35 pos45 dirright

5. To satisfy constraint 5, we need both pos42 and pos54 to be not clear simultaneously. Let's move player1 to pos42 and stone1 to pos54. First, move player1 to pos42:
   move player1 pos45 pos44 dirup
   move player1 pos44 pos43 dirup
   move player1 pos43 pos42 dirup

6. Now, we need to get stone1 from pos14 to pos54:
   We have player1 at pos42 and stone1 at pos14. To push stone1, player1 needs to be adjacent to it. So, player1 needs to move to one of: pos13, pos15, or pos24.
   move player1 pos42 pos32 dirleft
   move player1 pos32 pos22 dirleft
   move player1 pos22 pos12 dirleft
   move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown
   
   pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos14 pos24 dirright (After this, player1 is at pos14 and stone1 is at pos24.)
   move player1 pos14 pos24 dirright
   pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos24 pos34 dirright (After this, player1 is at pos24 and stone1 is at pos34.)
   move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright
   pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos34 pos44 dirright (After this, player1 is at pos34 and stone1 is at pos44.)
   move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright
   pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos44 pos54 dirright (After this, player1 is at pos44 and stone1 is at pos54.)

7. Now, constraint 5 is satisfied because stone1 is at pos54. However, player1 is at pos44, not pos42. To fully satisfy constraint 5, we still need player1 to be at pos42 simultaneously. Let's move player1 to pos42:
   move player1 pos44 pos43 dirup
   move player1 pos43 pos42 dirup

   Now, constraint 5 is satisfied because player1 is at pos42 and stone1 is at pos54, making both locations not clear simultaneously.

8. Now, let's move stone1 to the goal (pos41). First, we need to get player1 adjacent to stone1:
   move player1 pos42 pos43 dirdown
   move player1 pos43 pos44 dirdown
   move player1 pos44 pos54 dirright
   
   pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos54 pos54 pos53 dirup (After this, player1 is at pos54 and stone1 is at pos53.)
   move player1 pos54 pos53 dirup
   pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos53 pos53 pos52 dirup (After this, player1 is at pos53 and stone1 is at pos52.)
   move player1 pos53 pos52 dirup
   pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos52 pos52 pos51 dirup (After this, player1 is at pos52 and stone1 is at pos51.)
   move player1 pos52 pos51 dirup
   pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos51 pos51 pos41 dirleft (After this, player1 is at pos51 and stone1 is at pos41, which is a goal location, satisfying the task.)

9. According to constraint 2, after pos41 is not clear, player1 should be at pos14 or pos12 at some state. So, after pushing stone1 to pos41, we need to move player1 to pos14 or pos12:
   move player1 pos51 pos41 dirleft
   move player1 pos41 pos31 dirleft
   move player1 pos31 pos21 dirleft
   move player1 pos21 pos11 dirleft
   move player1 pos11 pos12 dirdown
   move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown
   move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown

   Now, player1 is at pos14, satisfying constraint 2.

So, the complete plan looks like:

1. move player1 pos55 pos45 dirleft
2. move player1 pos45 pos35 dirleft
3. move player1 pos35 pos25 dirleft
4. move player1 pos25 pos24 dirup
5. move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup
6. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos24 pos14 dirleft
7. move player1 pos24 pos14 dirleft
8. move player1 pos14 pos13 dirup
9. move player1 pos13 pos12 dirup
10. move player1 pos12 pos11 dirup
11. move player1 pos11 pos12 dirdown
12. move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown
13. move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown
14. move player1 pos14 pos15 dirdown
15. move player1 pos15 pos25 dirright
16. move player1 pos25 pos35 dirright
17. move player1 pos35 pos45 dirright
18. move player1 pos45 pos44 dirup
19. move player1 pos44 pos43 dirup
20. move player1 pos43 pos42 dirup
21. move player1 pos42 pos32 dirleft
22. move player1 pos32 pos22 dirleft
23. move player1 pos22 pos12 dirleft
24. move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown
25. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos14 pos24 dirright

48. move player1 pos11 pos12 dirdown
49. move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown
50. move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown

Hmm, wait. Looking at step 6 again, pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos24 pos14 dirleft, the precondition says "you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d," which means you can get from pos23 to pos24 following dirleft. But dirleft means going to the left, which is from pos24 to pos14, not from pos23 to pos24.

Let me double-check the meaning of the directions:
- dirright is going one position right.
- dirleft is going one position left.
- dirup is going one position up.
- dirdown is going one position down.

So, to push stone1 from pos24 to pos14, player1 needs to be at pos34, not pos23. Let me revise the plan (only the first few steps, the rest remains the same):

1. move player1 pos55 pos45 dirleft
2. move player1 pos45 pos35 dirleft
3. move player1 pos35 pos34 dirup
4. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos24 pos14 dirleft

Actually, looking at the rest of my plan, I realize I kind of intuitively had the directions wrong way. Let me carefully think about how the directions work here.

The grid is laid out as follows:
```
     1  2  3  4  5
1    .  .  .  .  .
2    .  .  .  S  .
3    .  .  .  .  .
4    G  .  .  .  .
5    .  .  .  .  P
```

And the directional movement is defined as follows:
"You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright" (moving right from pos11 to pos21).
"You may move from location pos11 to location pos12 following direction dirdown" (moving down from pos11 to pos12).

So that means dirright is moving from left to right, dirdown is moving from up to down.

This makes sense in terms of the row and column notation we have: posij denotes position at row i, column j.
going from pos11 to pos21 means going from (1,1) to (2,1), which is moving right.
going from pos11 to pos12 means going from (1,1) to (1,2), which is moving down.

Ok, let me revise my plan:

1. Let's start by moving player1 from pos55 to get to pos34 (adjacent to stone1):
   move player1 pos55 pos45 dirleft
   move player1 pos45 pos35 dirleft
   move player1 pos35 pos34 dirup

2. Push stone1 from pos24 to pos14:
   pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos24 pos14 dirup (After this, player1 is at pos24 and stone1 is at pos14.)

Ah, I see. For the "pushtonongoal" action, the direction d refers to the direction in which the player is pushing. In this case, to get from pos34 to pos24, the player would be moving up, and to get from pos24 to pos14, the player would again be moving up. So the direction is "dirup".

If these directions are correct, let me revise the plan:

1. Let's start by moving player1 from pos55 to get to pos34 (adjacent to stone1):
   move player1 pos55 pos45 dirleft
   move player1 pos45 pos35 dirleft
   move player1 pos35 pos34 dirup

2. Push stone1 from pos24 to pos14:
   pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos24 pos14 dirup (After this, player1 is at pos24 and stone1 is at pos14.)

3. Move player1 to pos11, making pos11 not clear (to satisfy constraint 4):
   move player1 pos24 pos14 dirup
   move player1 pos14 pos13 dirleft
   move player1 pos13 pos12 dirleft
   move player1 pos12 pos11 dirleft

4. Move player1 to pos45, making pos45 not clear (to satisfy constraint 3):
   move player1 pos11 pos12 dirright
   move player1 pos12 pos13 dirright
   move player1 pos13 pos14 dirright
   move player1 pos14 pos15 dirright
   move player1 pos15 pos25 dirdown
   move player1 pos25 pos35 dirdown
   move player1 pos35 pos45 dirdown

5. To satisfy constraint 5, we need both pos42 and pos54 to be not clear simultaneously. Let's move player1 to pos42 and stone1 to pos54. First, move player1 to pos42:
   move player1 pos45 pos44 dirleft
   move player1 pos44 pos43 dirleft
   move player1 pos43 pos42 dirleft

6. Now, we need to get stone1 from pos14 to pos54:
   We have player1 at pos42 and stone1 at pos14. To push stone1, player1 needs to be adjacent to it. So, player1 needs to move to one of the adjacent positions.
   move player1 pos42 pos32 dirup
   move player1 pos32 pos22 dirup
   move player1 pos22 pos12 dirup
   move player1 pos12 pos13 dirright
   
   pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos14 pos24 dirdown (After this, player1 is at pos14 and stone1 is at pos24.)
   move player1 pos14 pos24 dirdown
   pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos24 pos34 dirdown (After this, player1 is at pos24 and stone1 is at pos34.)
   move player1 pos24 pos34 dirdown
   pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos34 pos44 dirdown (After this, player1 is at pos34 and stone1 is at pos44.)
   move player1 pos34 pos44 dirdown
   pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos44 pos54 dirdown (After this, player1 is at pos44 and stone1 is at pos54.)

7. Now, constraint 5 is satisfied because stone1 is at pos54. However, player1 is at pos44, not pos42. To fully satisfy constraint 5, we still need player1 to be at pos42 simultaneously. Let's move player1 to pos42:
   move player1 pos44 pos43 dirleft
   move player1 pos43 pos42 dirleft

   Now, constraint 5 is satisfied because player1 is at pos42 and stone1 is at pos54, making both locations not clear simultaneously.

8. Now, let's move stone1 to the goal (pos41). First, we need to get player1 adjacent to stone1:
   move player1 pos42 pos43 dirright
   move player1 pos43 pos44 dirright
   move player1 pos44 pos54 dirdown
   
   pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos54 pos54 pos53 dirleft (After this, player1 is at pos54 and stone1 is at pos53.)
   move player1 pos54 pos53 dirleft
   pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos53 pos53 pos52 dirleft (After this, player1 is at pos53 and stone1 is at pos52.)
   move player1 pos53 pos52 dirleft
   pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos52 pos52 pos51 dirleft (After this, player1 is at pos52 and stone1 is at pos51.)
   move player1 pos52 pos51 dirleft
   pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos51 pos51 pos41 dirup (After this, player1 is at pos51 and stone1 is at pos41, which is a goal location, satisfying the task.)

9. According to constraint 2, after pos41 is not clear, player1 should be at pos14 or pos12 at some state. So, after pushing stone1 to pos41, we need to move player1 to pos14 or pos12:
   move player1 pos51 pos41 dirup
   move player1 pos41 pos31 dirup
   move player1 pos31 pos21 dirup
   move player1 pos21 pos11 dirup
   move player1 pos11 pos12 dirright
   move player1 pos12 pos13 dirright
   move player1 pos13 pos14 dirright

   Now, player1 is at pos14, satisfying constraint 2.

Actually wait. This solution still has problems. Let me carefully reconsider the directions based on the predicate "You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright".

moving from pos11 to pos21 means going from (1,1) to (2,1), which is increasing the first index. This is moving from the top-left corner to the one below it, which is a downward movement. So "dirright" actually means moving down, not right.

Let me reinterpret:
"You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright" (moving down from pos11 to pos21).
"You may move from location pos11 to location pos12 following direction dirdown" (moving right from pos11 to pos12).

That doesn't make sense either. Let's see the other examples:
"You may move from location pos15 to location pos25 following direction dirright" (moving from pos15 to pos25).
"You may move from location pos15 to location pos14 following direction dirup" (moving from pos15 to pos14).

Ah, I see the issue. The first index is the x-coordinate (column), and the second index is the y-coordinate (row). So posij represents the position at column i, row j.

So:
- dirright means moving from columnX to column(X+1).
- dirleft means moving from columnX to column(X-1).
- dirup means moving from rowY to row(Y-1).
- dirdown means moving from rowY to row(Y+1).

If the grid is visualized like this, the directional movements make sense:
```
     1  2  3  4  5
1    .  .  .  .  .
2    .  .  .  S  .
3    .  .  .  .  .
4    G  .  .  .  .
5    .  .  .  .  P
```

where posij is at column i, row j.

Actually, let me redraw it to avoid confusion:
```
     1   2   3   4   5
1   p11 p21 p31 p41 p51
2   p12 p22 p32 p42 p52
3   p13 p23 p33 p43 p53
4   p14 p24 p34 p44 p54
5   p15 p25 p35 p45 p55
```

Using this interpretation, the goal is at pos41, the agent starts at pos55, and the stone is at pos24.

Ok so this view is actually consistent with the provided predicates, where starting from position p11:
- dirright means going from p11 to p21
- dirdown means going from p11 to p12
- dirup is opposite of dirdown
- dirleft is opposite of dirright

Now let's redo our solution. The objective is to move stone1 from pos24 to the goal at pos41, satisfying the provided constraints.

From the initial state, the agent is at pos55 (5th column, 5th row) and stone1 is at pos24 (2nd column, 4th row). We eventually need to move the stone to pos41 (4th column, 1st row).

I'll not start over, but rather build a more intuitive plan:

1. Move player1 to a position adjacent to stone1 (pos24):
   move player1 pos55 pos45 dirleft
   move player1 pos45 pos35 dirleft
   move player1 pos35 pos25 dirleft
   move player1 pos25 pos15 dirleft
   move player1 pos15 pos14 dirup
   move player1 pos14 pos13 dirup
   move player1 pos13 pos23 dirright
   move player1 pos23 pos24 dirdown

2. Push stone1 to pos23:
   pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos24 pos23 dirleft (After this, player1 is at pos24 and stone1 is at pos23.)

3. Position player1 to push stone1 to pos22:
   move player1 pos24 pos23 dirleft (Now player1 is at pos23, adjacent to stone1.)
   pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos23 pos22 dirleft (After this, player1 is at pos23 and stone1 is at pos22.)

4. Position player1 to push stone1 to pos21:
   move player1 pos23 pos22 dirleft (Now player1 is at pos22, adjacent to stone1.)
   pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos22 pos21 dirleft (After this, player1 is at pos22 and stone1 is at pos21.)

5. Position player1 to push stone1 to pos31:
   move player1 pos22 pos21 dirleft (Now player1 is at pos21, adjacent to stone1.)
   pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos21 pos21 pos31 dirright (After this, player1 is at pos21 and stone1 is at pos31.)

6. Position player1 to push stone1 to pos41 (the goal):
   move player1 pos21 pos31 dirright (Now player1 is at pos31, adjacent to stone1.)
   pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos31 pos41 dirright (After this, player1 is at pos31 and stone1 is at pos41, the goal. This satisfies the main task.)

7. To satisfy constraint 1, pos41 should not be clear at some point. This is already satisfied once stone1 is at pos41.

8. To satisfy constraint 2, after pos41 is not clear, player1 should be at pos14 or pos12 at some state. Let's move player1 to pos14:
   move player1 pos31 pos21 dirleft
   move player1 pos21 pos11 dirleft
   move player1 pos11 pos12 dirdown
   move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown
   move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown

9. To satisfy constraint 3, pos45 should not be clear at some point. Let's move player1 to pos45:
   move player1 pos14 pos24 dirright
   move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright
   move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright
   move player1 pos44 pos45 dirdown

10. To satisfy constraint 4, before pos45 is not clear, either pos11 should not be clear or stone1 should be at pos35. Let's move player1 to pos11 before going to pos45:
    move player1 pos14 pos13 dirup
    move player1 pos13 pos12 dirup
    move player1 pos12 pos11 dirup
    (Now pos11 is not clear, satisfying the first part of constraint 4.)
    move player1 pos11 pos12 dirdown
    move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown
    move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown
    move player1 pos14 pos24 dirright
    move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright
    move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright
    move player1 pos44 pos45 dirdown
    (Now pos45 is not clear, satisfying constraint 3, and this happened after pos11 was not clear, satisfying constraint 4.)

11. To satisfy constraint 5, both pos42 and pos54 should not be clear simultaneously. Let's move the stone to pos42 and player1 to pos54:
    First, move player1 to pos42 (from pos45):
    move player1 pos45 pos44 dirup
    move player1 pos44 pos43 dirup
    move player1 pos43 pos42 dirup

12. Now, let's bring stone1 from pos41 (the goal) to pos54. This means temporarily removing it from the goal, which is not ideal. But to satisfy constraint 5, we'll do it, and then put the stone back on the goal.
    move player1 pos42 pos32 dirleft
    move player1 pos32 pos31 dirup
    move player1 pos31 pos41 dirright
    pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos41 pos41 pos51 dirright (After this, player1 is at pos41 and stone1 is at pos51.)
    move player1 pos41 pos51 dirright
    pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos51 pos51 pos52 dirdown (After this, player1 is at pos51 and stone1 is at pos52.)
    move player1 pos51 pos52 dirdown
    pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos52 pos52 pos53 dirdown (After this, player1 is at pos52 and stone1 is at pos53.)
    move player1 pos52 pos53 dirdown
    pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos53 pos53 pos54 dirdown (After this, player1 is at pos53 and stone1 is at pos54.)
    
    (At this point, stone1 is at pos54. We still need player1 to be at pos42. So, let's move player1 to pos42:)
    move player1 pos53 pos43 dirleft
    move player1 pos43 pos42 dirup

    (Now, stone1 is at pos54 and player1 is at pos42, making both positions not clear simultaneously, satisfying constraint 5.)

13. But we now need to move stone1 back to the goal (pos41):
    move player1 pos42 pos43 dirdown
    move player1 pos43 pos53 dirright
    move player1 pos53 pos54 dirdown
    pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos54 pos54 pos53 dirup (After this, player1 is at pos54 and stone1 is at pos53.)
    move player1 pos54 pos53 dirup
    pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos53 pos53 pos52 dirup (After this, player1 is at pos53 and stone1 is at pos52.)
    move player1 pos53 pos52 dirup
    pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos52 pos52 pos51 dirup (After this, player1 is at pos52 and stone1 is at pos51.)
    move player1 pos52 pos51 dirup
    pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos51 pos51 pos41 dirleft (After this, player1 is at pos51 and stone1 is at pos41, which is a goal location, satisfying the task.)

14. According to constraint 2, after pos41 is not clear, player1 should be at pos14 or pos12 at some state. We already moved player1 to pos14 in step 8, but to ensure it happens after the latest placement of the stone at pos41, let's move player1 to pos14 again:
    move player1 pos51 pos41 dirleft
    move player1 pos41 pos31 dirleft
    move player1 pos31 pos21 dirleft
    move player1 pos21 pos11 dirleft
    move player1 pos11 pos12 dirdown
    move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown
    move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown

    (Now, player1 is at pos14, satisfying the second part of constraint 2.)

This gives a plan that satisfies all the constraints. The stone starts by being pushed to the goal (pos41), then to fulfill the constraints, it's temporarily moved to pos54 and then back to the goal.

Let me check this again:
- The first plan puts the stone at pos41 and moves player to pos14.
- Then, stone is moved to pos54 and player is at pos42.
- Then stone is put back at pos41 and player is at pos14.

The main issue I see is that we're moving the stone away from the goal and then back, which seems unnecessary. Let's see if we can devise a more straightforward plan:

How about pushing the stone directly from pos24 to pos42. Then stone is still one step away from the goal pos41. Then position player1 at pos54 to satisfy constraint 5. The player then comes back to push the stone to the goal, then moves to pos14 to satisfy constraint 2.

Let's build this plan:

1. Move player1 to a position adjacent to stone1 (pos24):
   move player1 pos55 pos45 dirleft
   move player1 pos45 pos35 dirleft
   move player1 pos35 pos34 dirup
   
2. Push stone1 from pos24 towards pos42:
   pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos24 pos23 dirleft (After this, player1 is at pos24 and stone1 is at pos23.)
   move player1 pos24 pos23 dirleft
   pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos23 pos22 dirleft (After this, player1 is at pos23 and stone1 is at pos22.)
   move player1 pos23 pos22 dirleft
   pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos22 pos32 dirright (After this, player1 is at pos22 and stone1 is at pos32.)
   move player1 pos22 pos32 dirright
   pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos32 pos42 dirright (After this, player1 is at pos32 and stone1 is at pos42. Now, both pos42 is not clear.)

3. Move player1 to pos54 to make it not clear, satisfying constraint 5:
   move player1 pos32 pos33 dirdown
   move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown
   move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright
   move player1 pos44 pos54 dirright
   (Now, both pos42 and pos54 are not clear, satisfying constraint 5.)

4. Move player1 to pos43 to be in a position to push the stone to the goal:
   move player1 pos54 pos44 dirleft
   move player1 pos44 pos43 dirup
   
5. Push stone1 from pos42 to the goal (pos41):
   pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos42 pos41 dirleft (After this, player1 is at pos42 and stone1 is at pos41, which is a goal location, satisfying the task. Also, pos41 is not clear, satisfying constraint 1.)

6. To satisfy constraint 2, after pos41 is not clear, player1 should be at pos14 or pos12 at some state. So, let's move player1 to pos14:
   move player1 pos42 pos32 dirleft
   move player1 pos32 pos22 dirleft
   move player1 pos22 pos12 dirleft
   move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown
   move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown
   (Now, player1 is at pos14, satisfying constraint 2. Constraint 1 is also still satisfied because the stone is at pos41.)

7. To satisfy constraint 3, pos45 should not be clear at some point. So, let's move player1 to pos45:
   move player1 pos14 pos24 dirright
   move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright
   move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright
   move player1 pos44 pos45 dirdown
   (Now, pos45 is not clear, satisfying constraint 3.)

But, according to constraint 4, before pos45 is not clear, either pos11 should not be clear or stone1 should be at pos35. Neither of these conditions is met in our plan.

So one more time, let's devise a plan that satisfies all the constraints:

1. First, let's move player1 to pos11 to make it not clear, satisfying the first part of constraint 4:
   move player1 pos55 pos45 dirleft
   move player1 pos45 pos35 dirleft
   move player1 pos35 pos25 dirleft
   move player1 pos25 pos15 dirleft
   move player1 pos15 pos14 dirup
   move player1 pos14 pos13 dirup
   move player1 pos13 pos12 dirup
   move player1 pos12 pos11 dirup

2. Now, move player1 to pos45 to make it not clear, satisfying constraint 3. This also ensures that before pos45 is not clear, pos11 was not clear, satisfying constraint 4:
   move player1 pos11 pos21 dirright
   move player1 pos21 pos31 dirright
   move player1 pos31 pos41 dirright
   move player1 pos41 pos51 dirright
   move player1 pos51 pos52 dirdown
   move player1 pos52 pos53 dirdown
   move player1 pos53 pos54 dirdown
   move player1 pos54 pos55 dirdown
   move player1 pos55 pos45 dirleft

3. Now, to satisfy constraint 5, both pos42 and pos54 should not be clear simultaneously. Let's move player1 to pos54 and stone1 to pos42:
   move player1 pos45 pos44 dirup
   move player1 pos44 pos54 dirright

4. Now, we need to get stone1 to pos42:
   move player1 pos54 pos53 dirup
   move player1 pos53 pos43 dirleft
   move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft
   move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft
   move player1 pos23 pos24 dirdown
   pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos24 pos23 dirleft
   move player1 pos24 pos23 dirleft
   pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos23 pos33 dirright
   move player1 pos23 pos33 dirright
   pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos33 pos43 dirright
   move player1 pos33 pos43 dirright
   pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos43 pos42 dirup
   move player1 pos43 pos42 dirup
   move player1 pos42 pos43 dirdown
   move player1 pos43 pos44 dirdown
   move player1 pos44 pos54 dirright

   Now, stone1 is at pos42 and player1 is at pos54, making both positions not clear simultaneously, satisfying constraint 5.

5. Now, let's push stone1 to the goal (pos41):
   move player1 pos54 pos44 dirleft
   move player1 pos44 pos43 dirup
   move player1 pos43 pos42 dirleft
   pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos42 pos41 dirleft

   This places stone1 at pos41 (the goal), satisfying the task. Also, pos41 is not clear, satisfying constraint 1.

6. To satisfy constraint 2, after pos41 is not clear, player1 should be at pos14 or pos12 at some state. So, let's move player1 to pos14:
   move player1 pos42 pos32 dirleft
   move player1 pos32 pos22 dirleft
   move player1 pos22 pos12 dirleft
   move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown
   move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown

   Now, player1 is at pos14, satisfying constraint 2.

This gives a plan that satisfies all the constraints. Let's check:

Constraint 1: pos41 should not be clear at some point. This is satisfied because stone1 is at pos41.

Constraint 2: After pos41 is not clear, player1 should be at pos14 or pos12 at some state. This is satisfied by moving player1 to pos14 after pushing stone1 to pos41.

Constraint 3: pos45 should not be clear at some point. This is satisfied by moving player1 to pos45 in step 2.

Constraint 4: Before pos45 is not clear, either pos11 should not be clear or stone1 should be at pos35. This is satisfied by moving player1 to pos11 before moving to pos45 in step 1.

Constraint 5: At some point, both pos42 and pos54 should not be clear simultaneously. This is satisfied by having stone1 at pos42 and player1 at pos54 in step 4.

Task: stone1 is at a goal location. This is satisfied by pushing stone1 to pos41 (the goal) in step 5.
