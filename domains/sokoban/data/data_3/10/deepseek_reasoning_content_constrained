Okay, let's tackle this planning problem step by step. First, I need to understand the initial state and the goal. The agent starts at pos53, and the stone1 is at pos34. The goal is to have stone1 on a goal location, which in this case is pos25. The constraints add some complexity, so I need to make sure each is satisfied in the plan.

Looking at the constraints:

1. The agent must be at pos34 in at least one state. So, during the plan, the agent has to reach pos34.
2. If the agent is at pos34 in some state, then either pos52 is not clear at that state or in a later state. So after the agent is at pos34, we need to ensure pos52 is occupied at some point.
3. The agent can never be at pos43 in any state. So all actions must avoid moving through pos43.
4. pos44 must be not clear (occupied) in at least one state. So something needs to be there, either the agent or a stone.
5. If pos44 is not clear, then there must be an earlier state where pos55 is not clear. So before pos44 is occupied, pos55 must have been occupied first.

The stone starts at pos34, which is not a goal. The only goal location is pos25. So the main task is to move stone1 from pos34 to pos25. But how?

First, the agent is at pos53. Let's check the movement possibilities. From pos53, the agent can move up to pos52, left to pos43 (but pos43 is forbidden), or down to pos54. Wait, the agent can't go to pos43 because of constraint 3. So the initial moves must avoid that. So from pos53, the agent can go to pos52 or pos54.

But to get to pos34 where the stone is, the agent needs a path. Let's see the grid structure. pos34 is in row3, column4. The agent is at pos53 (row5, column3). To reach pos34, the agent needs to move upwards. Let's see possible paths.

Possible path: pos53 → pos54 (down? Wait, directions: dirdown probably means increasing the row number. Wait, the directions might be a bit confusing. Let me check the movement rules. For example, "You may move from location pos53 to location pos43 following direction dirleft"—wait, pos53 to pos43 is dirleft? Hmm, maybe the directions are based on movement in the grid. Let me clarify:

Looking at the movement from pos53: the possible moves are to pos43 (dirleft), pos52 (dirup), or pos54 (dirdown). Wait, but pos53 is row5, column3. So moving left (dirleft) would decrease the column? Or maybe the directions are relative. For example, dirleft might mean moving left in the grid, which would decrease the column number, but pos53 to pos43 is actually moving up in rows (from row5 to row4) but same column. Wait, maybe the directions are named differently. Let's check some of the movement entries:

For example, "You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright". pos11 is row1, column1. pos21 is row2, column1. So moving from pos11 to pos21 is moving down a row. So direction dirright here corresponds to moving down. Hmm, that's confusing. Wait, maybe the directions are named based on their direction in a grid where rows increase downwards. So dirright would be moving right in the row (same row, next column), dirdown would be moving down a row (same column, next row). Similarly, dirleft would be moving left in the column, and dirup would be moving up a row.

Wait, but the movement from pos11 to pos21 is direction dirright. pos11 is (1,1), pos21 is (2,1). So moving down a row. So perhaps dirright here is actually moving down. That's a bit counterintuitive. Alternatively, maybe the directions are named based on the direction from the starting position. For example, moving from pos11 to pos21 is moving down, so direction dirdown. But in the problem statement, the movement from pos11 to pos21 is listed as direction dirright. So perhaps the directions are named differently. This is critical for planning.

Looking again: the movement from pos11 to pos21 is direction dirright. pos11 (row1, column1) to pos21 (row2, column1). So moving down a row. So dirright corresponds to moving down. Similarly, movement from pos11 to pos12 is direction dirdown. pos11 to pos12 is same row, column increases by 1 (right). So direction dirdown corresponds to moving right. Wait, that's confusing. Let me check another example.

Movement from pos12 to pos22 is dirright. pos12 (row1, column2) to pos22 (row2, column2). So dirright again is moving down a row. Then, movement from pos12 to pos11 is dirup. So dirup would be moving left? Because pos12 to pos11 is same row, column decreases by 1 (left). But direction is dirup. Hmm, this suggests that the direction names are perhaps not aligned with standard directions. This is a problem. Without understanding the directions correctly, planning the movement is impossible.

Alternatively, maybe the directions are named based on the direction you face when moving. For example, moving from pos11 to pos21 (down a row) is dirright, which could mean that you turn right and then move forward. But that complicates things. Alternatively, perhaps the directions are named as per the keypad directions. For example, dirright is east, dirleft is west, dirup is north, dirdown is south. But then movement from pos11 to pos21 would be south, which would be dirdown. But in the problem statement, it's listed as dirright. So this is conflicting.

Wait, perhaps the directions are mislabeled. Let me check another example. For example, movement from pos12 to pos22 is dirright. pos12 is (1,2), pos22 (2,2). So moving down. If dirright is moving right (east), then that doesn't make sense. So perhaps the direction names are incorrect, or the movement is in a different way. Alternatively, maybe the direction refers to the direction from the current cell's perspective. For instance, moving to the cell to the right (east) would be dirright, but in the grid, that would be same row, column+1. However, pos11 to pos12 is direction dirdown, which would correspond to east. So this is conflicting.

This is a critical issue. To resolve this, let's list some movement directions:

- pos11 can move to pos21 (dirright) and pos12 (dirdown). So from pos11, dirright takes you to pos21 (down a row), dirdown takes you to pos12 (right a column).

Similarly, from pos12, dirright takes you to pos22 (down a row), dirup takes you to pos11 (left a column?), dirdown to pos13 (right a column).

This suggests that:

- dirright: move down a row (same column, row+1)
- dirleft: move up a row (same column, row-1)
- dirdown: move right a column (same row, column+1)
- dirup: move left a column (same row, column-1)

Wait, that's possible. Let's see:

pos11 (row1, column1) moving dirright would be row+1, same column → pos21 (row2, column1). Similarly, moving dirdown from pos11 would be column+1, same row → pos12 (row1, column2). Then, moving dirup from pos12 would be column-1 → pos11. Moving dirleft from pos21 would be row-1 → pos11. That seems to fit.

So the directions are:

- dirright: row+1 (down)
- dirleft: row-1 (up)
- dirdown: column+1 (right)
- dirup: column-1 (left)

But this is counterintuitive. So, for example, moving in the direction 'dirright' increases the row number (moving down), 'dirleft' decreases the row (moving up). 'dirdown' increases the column (moving right), 'dirup' decreases the column (moving left). That's the key here.

So directions:

- dirright → down (row+1)
- dirleft → up (row-1)
- dirdown → right (column+1)
- dirup → left (column-1)

So when the agent is at pos53 (row5, column3), moving dirright would take them to pos63, which doesn't exist. So possible moves from pos53 are:

- dirleft (row-1 → row4, column3 → pos43) but that's forbidden by constraint 3.
- dirup (column-1 → column2, row5 → pos52)
- dirdown (column+1 → column4, row5 → pos54)

So from pos53, the agent can go to pos52 (dirup) or pos54 (dirdown), but not to pos43 (dirleft) because it's forbidden.

The stone is at pos34 (row3, column4). The agent needs to get to pos34 to push the stone. Let's find a path from pos53 to pos34 that doesn't go through pos43.

Possible path:

pos53 → pos54 (dirdown, column4, row5). Then from pos54, can we move dirright (row+1) → pos64 (invalid). So dirright not possible. From pos54, directions allowed are:

Looking at the movement options for pos54:

"You may move from location pos54 to location pos44 following direction dirleft" (dirleft is row-1 → row4, column4 → pos44). Then from pos44, movement options include dirleft (row-1 → pos34), dirright (row+1 → pos54 again?), dirdown (column+1 → pos55), etc.

Wait, let me check the movement from pos54:

- "You may move from location pos54 to location pos44 following direction dirleft" (dirleft is row-1 → pos44)
- "You may move from location pos54 to location pos53 following direction dirup" (dirup is column-1 → pos53)
- "You may move from location pos54 to location pos55 following direction dirdown" (dirdown is column+1 → pos55)

So from pos54, the agent can go to pos44 (dirleft), pos53 (dirup), or pos55 (dirdown).

So, the path from pos53 to pos34:

Option 1: pos53 → pos54 (dirdown) → pos44 (dirleft) → pos34 (dirleft). But wait, from pos44, dirleft would be row-1 → row3, column4 → pos34. Yes. So:

Move from pos53 to pos54 (dirdown), then pos54 to pos44 (dirleft), then pos44 to pos34 (dirleft). But moving to pos34 is allowed only if pos34 is clear. However, in the initial state, pos34 has stone1. So the agent can't move into pos34 unless pushing the stone.

Wait, the agent can only move to a location if it's clear. Initially, pos34 has the stone, so it's not clear. So the agent can't move into pos34 directly. Therefore, the agent needs to push the stone from pos34 to another location.

So the agent needs to get adjacent to pos34 to push the stone. So where is the stone? pos34. To push it, the agent needs to be in a position adjacent to pos34 in the direction opposite to the direction of the push. For example, to push the stone from pos34 to pos24 (dirleft, which is row-1), the agent needs to be at pos34's dirright (row+1) direction, which is pos44. So agent at pos44, pushing the stone from pos34 to pos24 (dirleft). Then, after pushing, the agent ends up at pos34, and the stone is at pos24.

But the agent can't be at pos43 (constraint 3), so any path must avoid that. Let's think.

The stone is at pos34. The goal is to get it to pos25 (which is a goal location). How can we move it there?

Possible path for the stone: pos34 → pos24 → pos25. Because pos24 to pos25 is dirdown (column+1?), wait, no. Let me check movement from pos24:

"You may move from location pos24 to location pos14 following direction dirleft" (row-1 → pos14), "You may move from location pos24 to location pos34 following direction dirright" (row+1 → pos34), "You may move from location pos24 to location pos23 following direction dirup" (column-1 → pos23?), and "You may move from location pos24 to location pos25 following direction dirdown" (column+1 → pos25?).

Wait, according to the movement directions, moving from pos24 to pos25 is direction dirdown (column+1). So if the stone is at pos24, pushing it dirdown (column+1) would take it to pos25 (which is a goal). So that's the target.

So the plan could be:

1. Move agent from pos53 to pos44 (path: pos53 → pos54 → pos44)
2. Push the stone from pos34 to pos24 using pushtonongoal (since pos24 is not a goal, wait, but pos25 is the goal. Wait, pos24 is not a goal, so if we push from pos34 to pos24, we need to use pushtonongoal. Then from pos24, push to pos25 using pushtogoal.

But first, the agent needs to reach pos44 to push the stone from pos34 to pos24. Let's check preconditions for pushtonongoal:

pushtonongoal p s l_p l_from l_to d

Preconditions:

- agent p is at l_p (which must be adjacent to l_from in direction d)
- stone s is at l_from
- l_to is clear
- can move from l_p to l_from following d (so l_p is adjacent to l_from in direction d)
- can move from l_from to l_to following d (so l_from and l_to are adjacent in direction d)
- l_to is not a goal.

So, to push from pos34 to pos24 (dirleft direction), the agent must be at pos44 (since dirleft from pos34 is pos24, but to push, the agent needs to be at the direction opposite to the push. Wait, no. Wait, when you push, the agent is next to the stone in the direction from which the push is coming. For example, to push the stone from l_from to l_to in direction d, the agent must be at l_p which is in the direction opposite to d from l_from. Wait, the direction in the action is the direction from l_p to l_from and then from l_from to l_to. So for example, if the agent is at l_p, and l_from is in direction d from l_p, and l_to is in direction d from l_from, then the agent can push the stone from l_from to l_to. So the direction d must be the same for both moves (from l_p to l_from, and l_from to l_to).

So, to push the stone from pos34 to pos24 (dirleft direction), the agent must be at a position l_p such that l_p → pos34 is direction d. So l_p would be pos44 (since pos34's dirright direction is pos44 (dirright is row+1). So from pos44, moving dirleft (row-1) to pos34, then dirleft again (row-1) to pos24. So the direction d here is dirleft.

So the action would be pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos34 pos24 dirleft.

After this action, the stone is at pos24 (non-goal), agent moves to pos34. But then, we need to push the stone again to pos25, which is a goal. For that, the agent needs to be adjacent to pos24 in the direction towards pos25. pos24 to pos25 is dirdown (column+1). So the agent needs to be at pos24's dirup direction (column-1) or dirright (row+1), wait no. Let's see:

To push from pos24 to pos25 (dirdown direction), the agent needs to be in a position l_p such that moving direction d from l_p reaches pos24, and direction d from pos24 is pos25. So d must be dirdown. So the agent must be at pos23 (dirup from pos24) or pos25 (dirleft from pos24)? Wait, no. Wait, pos24's dirdown direction is pos25. So moving dirdown from pos24 is pos25. So the agent must be in a position that can move to pos24 via direction dirdown. Wait, no: the direction is the same for both moving from l_p to l_from and l_from to l_to. So l_p must be in the direction opposite to d from l_from.

If the push direction is dirdown (from l_from=pos24 to l_to=pos25), then the agent must be in the direction opposite to dirdown from l_from. Dirdown is column+1. The opposite direction would be dirup (column-1). So l_p would be pos24's dirup direction, which is pos23. Because from pos23, moving dirdown (column+1) gets to pos24. Wait, no. Let's clarify:

If the agent is at pos23, moving dirdown (column+1) would take them to pos24. Then, from pos24, moving dirdown (column+1) would take to pos25. So direction d is dirdown.

So the action would be pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos24 pos25 dirdown.

But the agent is currently at pos34 after the first push. How to get to pos23?

From pos34, possible moves. pos34 can move to pos24 (dirleft), pos44 (dirright), pos33 (dirup), pos35 (dirdown). But the agent is at pos34. However, after the first push, the agent is now at pos34. But pos34 is now clear? Wait, after the pushtonongoal action, the agent moves from pos44 to pos34. So after pushing, the agent is at pos34. But the constraint says that the agent must be at pos34 in at least one state, which is satisfied here. Now, we need to ensure that after this state, pos52 is not clear in some state.

But let's proceed. Now the agent is at pos34, and the stone is at pos24. Next step is to push the stone from pos24 to pos25. To do that, the agent needs to get to pos23, which is adjacent to pos24 in the dirup direction (column-1). So from pos34, how can the agent reach pos23?

Possible path: pos34 → pos33 (dirup, column-1) → pos23 (dirleft, row-1). But moving from pos34 to pos33 is dirup (column-1). pos33 is column3. Then from pos33, dirleft (row-1) to pos23. So:

move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup

Then move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft.

But wait, pos33 is clear? Initially, yes. After the first push, the agent is at pos34, and the stone is at pos24. So pos33 is clear. So the agent can move from pos34 to pos33 (dirup). Then from pos33 to pos23 (dirleft). Now, the agent is at pos23. Then, perform the pushtogoal action:

pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos24 pos25 dirdown

This moves the stone to pos25, which is a goal location.

But wait, need to check the preconditions for pushtogoal:

- agent is at pos23 (yes)
- stone is at pos24 (yes)
- pos25 is clear (initially, pos25 is clear)
- can move from pos23 to pos24 via dirdown (since from pos23, moving dirdown (column+1) would take to pos24. Yes, that's allowed as per movement rules: "You may move from location pos23 to location pos24 following direction dirdown".
- can move from pos24 to pos25 via dirdown (yes, as per "You may move from location pos24 to location pos25 following direction dirdown").
- pos25 is a goal location (yes).

So this action is valid. After this, the stone is at pos25 (goal), and the agent is at pos24.

But now, we have to satisfy the other constraints.

Constraints:

1. Agent must be at pos34 at least once (satisfied after the first push).
2. If agent is at pos34 in some state, then pos52 must be not clear in that state or later. So after the agent is at pos34, we need to make sure that pos52 is occupied. pos52 is initially clear. The agent can move there or push a stone there, but there are no other stones. So the agent needs to move to pos52 at some point after being at pos34.

But in the current plan steps, after pushing the stone to pos25, the agent is at pos24. Then, to satisfy the constraint, the agent needs to move to pos52.

Path from pos24 to pos52. Let's see:

pos24 → pos23 (dirup) → pos22 (dirup) → pos21 (dirup) → pos31 (dirright) → pos41 (dirright) → pos51 (dirright) → pos52 (dirdown). But that's a long path. Alternatively, from pos24, agent can move to pos25 (dirdown) if it's clear. After the stone is at pos25, pos25 is not clear (stone there). So agent can't move there. So from pos24, possible moves are:

- dirleft (row-1) to pos14 (if clear)
- dirright (row+1) to pos34 (but after the first push, pos34 is occupied by the agent, then after moving to pos33 and pos23, pos34 is cleared again? Let's check the states.

After the first push (pushtonongoal), the stone is at pos24, agent is at pos34. Then the agent moves to pos33 (dirup), so pos34 becomes clear. Then agent moves to pos23 (dirleft from pos33). Then performs the pushtogoal, ending up at pos24. So in the state after the pushtogoal, the agent is at pos24. Then, to reach pos52, the agent needs to navigate through allowed positions, avoiding pos43.

Possible path from pos24 to pos52:

pos24 → pos23 (dirup) → pos22 (dirup) → pos21 (dirup) → pos31 (dirright) → pos41 (dirright) → pos51 (dirright) → pos52 (dirdown).

But that's 7 moves. However, each move action takes time. But since the plan needs to be optimal (shortest possible), this may not be optimal.

Alternatively, after the stone is at pos25, perhaps the agent can move to pos25 (but it's occupied by the stone). So no. Alternatively, from pos24, move to pos25 (dirdown) is not possible because it's occupied. So other directions: pos24 → pos23 (dirup), then move to pos22 (dirup), pos21 (dirup), pos31 (dirright), etc.

But this seems long. Is there a shorter path? Let's see:

pos24 → pos23 (dirup) → pos22 (dirup) → pos21 (dirup) → pos31 (dirright) → pos32 (dirdown) → pos42 (dirright) → pos52 (dirright). Wait, but pos32 to pos42 is possible via dirright (row+1). Then pos42 to pos52 via dirright (row+1 again). Wait, pos42 is row4, column2. dirright (row+1) would take to row5, column2 → pos52. Yes. So:

pos24 → pos23 (dirup) → pos22 (dirup) → pos21 (dirup) → pos31 (dirright) → pos32 (dirdown) → pos42 (dirright) → pos52 (dirright).

That's 7 moves. But maybe there's a shorter path. Alternatively, from pos24, move to pos34 (dirright), but pos34 is clear after the agent moves to pos33. So after the first push and moving to pos33, pos34 is clear. Then agent can move back to pos34, then to pos44, etc. But that may not help.

Alternatively, after the stone is at pos25 and the agent is at pos24, perhaps the agent can move to pos23, then pos24 again? Not helpful.

Alternatively, from pos24, move to pos34 (dirright), then pos44 (dirright), then pos54 (dirright), then pos55 (dirdown), then pos54 (dirup), then pos53 (dirup), then pos52 (dirup). But this requires pos34 to be clear. After the first push, the agent was at pos34, then moved to pos33, leaving pos34 clear. So yes, pos34 is clear. So path:

pos24 → pos34 (dirright) → pos44 (dirright) → pos54 (dirright) → pos55 (dirdown). Wait, from pos54, dirdown is column+1 → pos55. Then from pos55, dirup is column-1 → pos54, etc. But then from pos55, moving dirleft (row-1) to pos45. But this seems longer.

Alternatively, pos24 → pos34 (dirright) → pos44 (dirright) → pos54 (dirright) → pos55 (dirdown). Then, from pos55, move dirleft (row-1) to pos45 → pos44 (dirleft) → pos34 (dirleft) → ... No, this isn't helpful.

Alternatively, after pos24, the agent could move to pos34 (dirright), then pos44 (dirright), then pos54 (dirright), then pos55 (dirdown). Then, from pos55, move to pos54 (dirup), then pos53 (dirup), then pos52 (dirup). That would be:

move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright

move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright

move player1 pos44 pos54 dirright

move player1 pos54 pos55 dirdown

move player1 pos55 pos54 dirup

move player1 pos54 pos53 dirup

move player1 pos53 pos52 dirup

That's 7 moves again. So same length as the other path.

But this might be necessary to reach pos52. However, this uses 7 move actions, which adds to the plan length. But since the plan needs to be optimal (shortest possible), perhaps there's a smarter way.

Wait, perhaps after the agent pushes the stone to pos25, the agent is at pos24. Then, to reach pos52, the agent can move in a different path. For example:

pos24 → pos23 (dirup) → pos13 (dirleft) → pos12 (dirup) → pos11 (dirup) → ... No, that's going the wrong way.

Alternatively, pos24 → pos25 (dirright) but it's blocked by the stone. So not possible.

Alternatively, pos24 → pos23 (dirup) → pos22 (dirup) → pos21 (dirup) → pos31 (dirright) → pos41 (dirright) → pos51 (dirright) → pos52 (dirdown). That's 7 moves. So either way, it's 7 move actions.

But this would make the total plan:

1. move player1 pos53 pos54 dirdown

2. move player1 pos54 pos44 dirleft

3. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos34 pos24 dirleft

4. move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup

5. move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft

6. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos24 pos25 dirdown

7. move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup

8. move player1 pos23 pos22 dirup

9. move player1 pos22 pos21 dirup

10. move player1 pos21 pos31 dirright

11. move player1 pos31 pos41 dirright

12. move player1 pos41 pos51 dirright

13. move player1 pos51 pos52 dirdown

But this is 13 actions. However, this is not optimal. There must be a shorter way.

Wait, the constraints require that after the agent is at pos34 (which happens in step 3), then pos52 must be not clear at some state after. So the agent just needs to move to pos52 at some point after step 3. So the agent can go to pos52 after completing the stone movement. So after step 6, when the stone is at pos25 (goal), the agent can move to pos52, making pos52 not clear. But how?

Another approach: After step 6 (agent at pos24), the agent can move to pos23 (dirup), then pos22 (dirup), pos21 (dirup), pos31 (dirright), pos41 (dirright), pos51 (dirright), pos52 (dirdown). That's 6 moves. So steps 7-12: 6 move actions. So total actions would be 6 (initial steps) + 6 (moving to pos52) = 12. But maybe there's a shorter path.

Alternatively, after step 6, agent is at pos24. Can the agent move to pos25 (dirdown) is blocked. So from pos24, move to pos23 (dirup). Then from pos23, move to pos22 (dirup), pos21 (dirup), pos31 (dirright), pos32 (dirdown), pos42 (dirright), pos52 (dirright). That's 6 moves.

But how to get from pos31 to pos32? pos31 can move to pos32 via dirdown (column+1). Then pos32 to pos42 via dirright (row+1). Then pos42 to pos52 via dirright (row+1). So:

pos24 → pos23 (dirup)

pos23 → pos22 (dirup)

pos22 → pos21 (dirup)

pos21 → pos31 (dirright)

pos31 → pos32 (dirdown)

pos32 → pos42 (dirright)

pos42 → pos52 (dirright)

That's 7 moves. So steps 7-13: 7 moves. Total steps: 6 (initial) +7=13.

But this is not optimal. Let's think differently.

Wait, what if after pushing the stone to pos25, the agent is at pos24. Then, instead of moving all the way to pos52, the agent could move to pos55 and then to pos54, pos53, etc., but how does that help? Because we need to have the agent at pos52 to make it not clear.

Alternatively, after the stone is at pos25, the agent can move to pos25's location if possible. But the stone is there, so pos25 is not clear. So the agent can't move there.

Alternative idea: After the first push (step3), the agent is at pos34. At that point, the constraint requires that pos52 is not clear at some state after. So the agent could move to pos52 directly after step3, before moving the stone to the goal. But that would require backtracking, which might not be optimal.

But let's consider:

After step3 (agent at pos34), the agent needs to move to pos52. How?

From pos34, possible moves:

pos34 can move to pos33 (dirup), pos44 (dirright), pos24 (dirleft), or pos35 (dirdown).

To get to pos52, from pos34:

Option: pos34 → pos44 (dirright) → pos54 (dirright) → pos55 (dirdown) → pos54 (dirup) → pos53 (dirup) → pos52 (dirup). That's 6 moves. Then, after reaching pos52, proceed to push the stone. But this would make the plan longer.

But perhaps it's better to satisfy the constraint early.

So steps:

1. move player1 pos53 pos54 dirdown

2. move player1 pos54 pos44 dirleft

3. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos34 pos24 dirleft (agent at pos34)

Now, the agent is at pos34. Then, instead of proceeding to push the stone to pos25, the agent moves to pos52 first:

4. move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright

5. move player1 pos44 pos54 dirright

6. move player1 pos54 pos55 dirdown

7. move player1 pos55 pos54 dirup

8. move player1 pos54 pos53 dirup

9. move player1 pos53 pos52 dirup

Now, pos52 is occupied by the agent, satisfying the constraint. Then, the agent needs to go back to pos24 to push the stone to pos25. But this would add many steps.

Alternatively, after step3 (agent at pos34), the agent needs to get to pos52. Let's see:

pos34 → pos44 (dirright) → pos54 (dirright) → pos55 (dirdown) → pos54 (dirup) → pos53 (dirup) → pos52 (dirup). That's 6 moves. Then, from pos52, the agent needs to return to pos24 to push the stone. But this would make the plan very long. Not optimal.

This suggests that the initial plan of first moving the stone to the goal and then moving to pos52 is better, even if it's longer, but maybe there's a smarter way.

Alternatively, can the agent push the stone to pos25 in a way that also requires moving to pos52 as part of the process? For example, after pushing the stone to pos25, the agent has to move through pos52.

But how?

Alternatively, after pushing the stone to pos25, the agent is at pos24. Then, instead of moving all the way up, maybe the agent can move to pos55 first to satisfy the pos44 constraint.

Wait, there's another constraint: pos44 must be not clear in at least one state, and if pos44 is not clear, then pos55 must have been not clear earlier.

So, the agent needs to make sure that pos55 is occupied before pos44. So maybe the agent can move to pos55 first, then to pos44.

But how? Let's see:

Suppose after the stone is at pos25, the agent moves to pos24 → pos34 (dirright) → pos44 (dirright) → pos54 (dirright) → pos55 (dirdown). Then pos55 is occupied. Then, moving back to pos44 (dirup) would make pos44 occupied. So:

Steps after stone is at pos25:

7. move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright

8. move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright

9. move player1 pos44 pos54 dirright

10. move player1 pos54 pos55 dirdown (now pos55 is not clear)

11. move player1 pos55 pos54 dirup

12. move player1 pos54 pos44 dirleft (now pos44 is not clear)

But this satisfies the constraint that pos44 is not clear (step12) and pos55 was not clear earlier (step10).

Then, the agent needs to move to pos52. From pos44, move to pos54, then pos53, then pos52.

But this adds steps. But it's necessary for the constraints.

So putting it all together:

Initial steps to move the stone:

1. move pos53 → pos54 (dirdown)

2. move pos54 → pos44 (dirleft)

3. pushtonongoal pos44 → pos34 → pos24 dirleft (agent at pos34)

Then, move to pos52:

4. move pos34 → pos44 (dirright)

5. move pos44 → pos54 (dirright)

6. move pos54 → pos55 (dirdown) → pos55 is not clear (constraint for pos44)

7. move pos55 → pos54 (dirup)

8. move pos54 → pos44 (dirleft) → pos44 is not clear (satisfies constraint 4)

Then, proceed to push the stone:

But wait, the stone is already at pos24. The agent is at pos44. How to get back to push it to pos25? This approach seems to complicate things.

Alternative approach: Use the pushtonongoal and pushtogoal actions in a way that also satisfies the constraints.

Wait, another constraint: pos44 must be not clear in at least one state. So either the agent or a stone must be there. Since there's only one stone, which is at pos24 after the first push, then to have pos44 not clear, the agent must be there. So the agent needs to be at pos44 at some point.

But how to have pos55 not clear before pos44 is not clear. So the agent needs to be at pos55 before being at pos44.

So, perhaps the agent should first move to pos55, then to pos44.

But the agent starts at pos53. So:

1. move pos53 → pos54 (dirdown)

2. move pos54 → pos55 (dirdown) → pos55 is not clear (satisfies pos55 not clear)

3. move pos55 → pos54 (dirup)

4. move pos54 → pos44 (dirleft) → pos44 is not clear (satisfies pos44 not clear, and pos55 was not clear earlier)

But then, after this, the agent needs to push the stone. However, the stone is at pos34. So after step4, the agent is at pos44. From there, push the stone from pos34 to pos24 (dirleft). Then proceed as before.

But this approach would satisfy the constraints first, then handle the stone.

So revised plan:

Steps:

1. move player1 pos53 pos54 dirdown (pos54 is clear)

2. move player1 pos54 pos55 dirdown (now pos55 is not clear)

3. move player1 pos55 pos54 dirup (pos55 is clear again, but the constraint for pos44 requires that pos55 was not clear before pos44. So step2 makes pos55 not clear, then step3 leaves it clear. Then, step4:

4. move player1 pos54 pos44 dirleft → pos44 is not clear now. This satisfies constraint4 (pos44 not clear) and the constraint5 (pos55 was not clear in step2, which is before step4).

Then, the agent is at pos44. Now, push the stone from pos34 to pos24:

5. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos34 pos24 dirleft (agent moves to pos34, stone to pos24)

Now, constraint1 is satisfied (agent at pos34 in step5).

Then, need to ensure that after step5, pos52 is not clear at some point.

From pos34, the agent can move to pos44, then to pos54, pos53, and pos52.

6. move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright

7. move player1 pos44 pos54 dirright

8. move player1 pos54 pos53 dirup

9. move player1 pos53 pos52 dirup (pos52 is not clear now)

This satisfies constraint2: after step5 (agent at pos34), in step9, pos52 is not clear.

Now, the stone is at pos24. Need to push it to pos25 (goal).

The agent is at pos52. Need to get to pos23 to push the stone.

But pos52 is row5, column2. To get to pos23, which is row2, column3. That's a long path, but perhaps:

From pos52 → pos42 (dirleft) → pos32 (dirleft) → pos22 (dirleft) → pos23 (dirdown).

Wait, pos52 → pos42 (dirleft) → row5 to row4? Wait, directions again: from pos52 (row5, column2), moving dirleft (row-1) would be row4, column2 → pos42. Then from pos42, dirleft (row-1) → pos32. Then from pos32, dirleft (row-1) → pos22. Then from pos22, dirdown (column+1) → pos23. Then from pos23, push the stone.

But this requires several moves:

10. move player1 pos52 pos42 dirleft

11. move player1 pos42 pos32 dirleft

12. move player1 pos32 pos22 dirleft

13. move player1 pos22 pos23 dirdown

14. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos24 pos25 dirdown

This adds 5 more steps, making the total steps 14.

But this is longer than the initial plan. However, this satisfies all constraints:

- agent was at pos34 (step5)
- after step5, pos52 is not clear in step9
- agent never at pos43
- pos44 was not clear in step4, and pos55 was not clear in step2 (earlier)
- stone is at pos25 (goal)

But the plan length is 14 actions, which may not be optimal. 

But perhaps there's a shorter way. Let's see if there's a way to combine steps.

Alternative plan:

1. move player1 pos53 pos54 dirdown

2. move player1 pos54 pos55 dirdown (pos55 not clear)

3. move player1 pos55 pos54 dirup

4. move player1 pos54 pos44 dirleft (pos44 not clear)

5. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos34 pos24 dirleft (agent at pos34)

6. move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright

7. move player1 pos44 pos54 dirright

8. move player1 pos54 pos53 dirup

9. move player1 pos53 pos52 dirup (pos52 not clear)

10. move player1 pos52 pos42 dirleft

11. move player1 pos42 pos32 dirleft

12. move player1 pos32 pos22 dirleft

13. move player1 pos22 pos23 dirdown

14. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos24 pos25 dirdown

Total 14 steps. But is this optimal? The initial plan without constraints could be done in 6 steps (move to pos44, push to pos24, move to pos23, push to pos25). But the constraints require additional steps to move to pos55, pos44, and pos52, increasing the length.

Is there a way to optimize this?

Alternatively, after step5 (agent at pos34), the agent can move directly to pos52 via a different path.

From pos34, possible moves:

pos34 → pos44 (dirright) → pos54 (dirright) → pos55 (dirdown) → pos54 (dirup) → pos53 (dirup) → pos52 (dirup). That's 6 steps. But this is the same as before.

Alternatively, from pos34 → pos33 (dirup) → pos23 (dirleft) → pos22 (dirup) → pos21 (dirup) → pos31 (dirright) → pos41 (dirright) → pos51 (dirright) → pos52 (dirdown). That's 8 steps. Not better.

So it's challenging to find a shorter path. Therefore, the minimal plan must include these steps to satisfy all constraints, leading to a longer plan.

But perhaps there's a way to satisfy the constraints with fewer steps. For example:

- The agent must be at pos34 (step5).
- After that, pos52 must be occupied (step9).
- pos44 must be occupied (step4), with pos55 occupied earlier (step2).
- Avoid pos43.

Another approach: After step4 (agent at pos44), push the stone from pos34 to pos24, then the agent is at pos34. Then move to pos44, then pos54, pos55 (satisfy pos55), then move back to pos54, pos44 (satisfy pos44), then move to pos53, pos52.

But I'm not sure if this is shorter.

Alternatively, after pushing the stone to pos25, the agent can move to pos55, then to pos44. But pos55 needs to be occupied before pos44.

But after the stone is at pos25, the agent is at pos24. Then:

move pos24 → pos34 (dirright)

move pos34 → pos44 (dirright)

move pos44 → pos54 (dirright)

move pos54 → pos55 (dirdown) → pos55 not clear

move pos55 → pos54 (dirup)

move pos54 → pos44 (dirleft) → pos44 not clear

Then move to pos52.

But this way, pos55 is occupied after pos44 is not clear, which violates the constraint that pos55 must be occupied before pos44. So the order is wrong.

So the correct order is to first occupy pos55, then occupy pos44.

Therefore, the initial steps to occupy pos55 and pos44 must be done before pushing the stone.

This suggests that the plan must first visit pos55 and pos44 before handling the stone, but that would require the agent to go out of the way, increasing the plan length.

But given the constraints, it's necessary.

So the optimal plan would look like:

1. move player1 pos53 pos54 dirdown

2. move player1 pos54 pos55 dirdown (pos55 not clear)

3. move player1 pos55 pos54 dirup

4. move player1 pos54 pos44 dirleft (pos44 not clear)

5. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos34 pos24 dirleft (agent at pos34)

6. move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright

7. move player1 pos44 pos54 dirright

8. move player1 pos54 pos53 dirup

9. move player1 pos53 pos52 dirup (pos52 not clear)

10. move player1 pos52 pos42 dirleft

11. move player1 pos42 pos32 dirleft

12. move player1 pos32 pos22 dirleft

13. move player1 pos22 pos23 dirdown

14. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos24 pos25 dirdown

This plan has 14 steps. But is there a way to shorten it?

Wait, after step5 (agent at pos34), the agent needs to get to pos52. Instead of steps6-9, can we find a shorter path from pos34 to pos52?

From pos34, possible moves:

pos34 → pos44 (dirright) → pos54 (dirright) → pos53 (dirup) → pos52 (dirup). That's 4 steps:

6. move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright

7. move player1 pos44 pos54 dirright

8. move player1 pos54 pos53 dirup

9. move player1 pos53 pos52 dirup

This is steps6-9 as before. So yes, that's 4 moves. So steps6-9 are necessary.

Then steps10-14: 5 moves. So total 14 steps.

Is there any way to avoid some of these moves?

Another idea: After step5 (agent at pos34), can the agent move directly to pos52 via pos33, pos23, etc.? For example:

pos34 → pos33 (dirup) → pos23 (dirleft) → pos22 (dirup) → pos21 (dirup) → pos31 (dirright) → pos41 (dirright) → pos51 (dirright) → pos52 (dirdown). But that's 8 moves, which is longer than steps6-9.

So the initial path is better.

Therefore, the plan with 14 steps seems necessary. However, the user asked for an optimal plan with minimal length. But perhaps there's a smarter way to satisfy the constraints with fewer steps.

Let's re-express the constraints to ensure we're covering them:

1. Agent must be at pos34 at least once. (step5)

2. If agent is at pos34 (step5), then pos52 must be not clear in some state after (step9).

3. Agent must never be at pos43. (all steps avoid pos43)

4. pos44 must be not clear at least once (step4).

5. If pos44 is not clear (step4), then pos55 must have been not clear earlier (step2).

All these are satisfied in the current plan.

Now, can we combine some actions?

For example, step2: move to pos55, then step3: move back to pos54. But these are necessary to satisfy the pos55 requirement before pos44.

Another idea: Use a push action to move the stone in a way that also moves the agent to pos34 and pos44. But the stone is initially at pos34, so the first push moves it to pos24.

After that, the agent is at pos34. Then, moving to pos44 and pos54, etc.

But I don't see a way to combine these steps.

Alternatively, after step5 (agent at pos34), the agent moves to pos44 (step6), which makes pos44 not clear again. But step4 already made pos44 not clear. So that's redundant. Wait, step4 makes pos44 not clear (agent there), then step6 moves away (pos44 becomes clear), step6 moves to pos44 again (pos44 not clear again). But the constraint only requires pos44 to be not clear in at least one state, which is satisfied in step4. So step6 is not necessary for the constraint. Therefore, steps6-9 are only needed to get to pos52.

But step6 is necessary to move towards pos52.

Hmm, perhaps there's a different way to get from pos34 to pos52.

After step5, agent is at pos34. Need to reach pos52.

Another path: pos34 → pos35 (dirdown) → pos45 (dirright) → pos55 (dirright) → pos54 (dirup) → pos53 (dirup) → pos52 (dirup). But:

- pos34 to pos35 (dirdown: column+1 → row3, column5? Wait, pos34 is row3, column4. dirdown is column+1 → column5, row3 → pos35? Yes.

So:

6. move player1 pos34 pos35 dirdown (pos35 is clear initially)

7. move player1 pos35 pos45 dirright (row+1 → pos45)

8. move player1 pos45 pos55 dirright (row+1 → pos55)

9. move player1 pos55 pos54 dirup (column-1 → pos54)

10. move player1 pos54 pos53 dirup (column-1 → pos53)

11. move player1 pos53 pos52 dirup (column-1 → pos52)

This path is 6 moves (steps6-11). But earlier path was 4 moves (steps6-9). So this is longer. Not better.

Thus, the initial plan remains the best so far.

But the user requires the optimal (shortest) plan. So perhaps there's a shorter plan that I'm missing.

Let me try to think differently. What if the agent pushes the stone to pos25 via a different route that also allows satisfying the constraints?

For example, after moving the stone to pos24, instead of the agent moving up to pos23, perhaps the agent can push the stone to pos25 directly from pos24 by being in a different position.

But to push from pos24 to pos25 (dirdown), the agent must be at pos24's dirup direction (column-1), which is pos23. So the agent must be at pos23 to push dirdown to pos25.

No alternative there.

Another idea: The agent can move to pos55 early on, then to pos44, push the stone, then move to pos52.

But let's outline:

1. move pos53 → pos54 (dirdown)

2. move pos54 → pos55 (dirdown) → pos55 not clear

3. move pos55 → pos54 (dirup)

4. move pos54 → pos44 (dirleft) → pos44 not clear

5. pushtonongoal pos44 → pos34 → pos24 (agent at pos34)

6. move pos34 → pos44 (dirright)

7. move pos44 → pos54 (dirright)

8. move pos54 → pos53 (dirup)

9. move pos53 → pos52 (dirup) → pos52 not clear

10. move pos52 → pos42 (dirleft)

11. move pos42 → pos32 (dirleft)

12. move pos32 → pos22 (dirleft)

13. move pos22 → pos23 (dirdown)

14. pushtogoal pos23 → pos24 → pos25 dirdown

This is the same 14-step plan. 

Is there any way to reduce the number of steps?

Perhaps by combining the movement to pos55 and pos44 with the stone-pushing steps.

Alternatively, after pushing the stone to pos24 (step5), the agent is at pos34. From there, move to pos35 (dirdown), then to pos45 (dirright), then to pos55 (dirright). Now, pos55 is not clear (step7). Then move to pos54 (dirup), pos44 (dirleft) (step9, pos44 not clear). Then proceed to pos52.

But this would require:

6. move pos34 pos35 dirdown

7. move pos35 pos45 dirright

8. move pos45 pos55 dirright

9. move pos55 pos54 dirup

10. move pos54 pos44 dirleft

11. move pos44 pos54 dirright

12. move pos54 pos53 dirup

13. move pos53 pos52 dirup

Then proceed to push the stone from pos24 to pos25.

But after step10, the agent is at pos44. How to push the stone from pos24 to pos25? The agent needs to be at pos23. So:

14. move pos44 pos34 dirleft

15. move pos34 pos33 dirup

16. move pos33 pos23 dirleft

17. pushtogoal pos23 pos24 pos25 dirdown

This adds 4 more steps, making total steps 17, which is longer.

So not helpful.

Another approach: Let's see if any steps can be eliminated. For example, steps3 and4: after moving to pos55 and back to pos54, maybe the agent can go directly to pos44 from pos55.

But pos55 to pos44 would require moving dirleft (row-1) to pos45, then dirleft (row-1) to pos35, etc. Not helpful.

Alternatively, after step2 (pos55), move dirleft (row-1) to pos45, then dirleft (row-1) to pos35, then dirleft (row-1) to pos25 (but pos25 is a goal and currently clear). But this path doesn't lead to pos44.

Hmm.

It seems that the initial plan of 14 steps is the shortest possible to satisfy all constraints. Therefore, the answer should be the 14-step plan.
