Let me understand the problem:

1. We have a 2D grid where each position may contain the agent, a stone, or be empty.
2. The goal is to manipulate the agent to move all stones to goal positions.
3. In this case, there is one agent (`player1`) and one stone (`stone1`).

The agent can:
1. Move to an adjacent clear position.
2. Push a stone to a goal location.
3. Push a stone to a non-goal location.

The initial state is:
- `player1` is at `pos54`
- `stone1` is at `pos24`
- `pos12` is the only goal location.

The task is to bring the stone to the goal location, i.e., move `stone1` to `pos12`.

There are additional constraints:
1. `player1` must be at `pos25` in at least one state.
2. If `player1` is at `pos25`, then `pos22` must not be clear at that state or a later state.
3. Location `pos34` must not be clear in at most one continuous sequence of states.
4. Location `pos12` must not be clear in at least one state.
5. If location `pos12` is not clear, there must be an earlier state where `player1` is at `pos41`.

Now, let's think about how to solve this problem:

1. We need to move `stone1` from `pos24` to `pos12`, the goal location.
2. The agent `player1` starts at `pos54` and needs to reach `pos24` to push the stone.
3. The agent must visit `pos25` and `pos41` at some point, and after visiting `pos25`, it must ensure that `pos22` is not clear.
4. The location `pos34` can be occupied (not clear) at most once.
5. The location `pos12` must be occupied (not clear) at least once, which makes sense since the stone needs to be there.

Let's first visualize the grid to better understand the problem:

```
  1  2  3  4  5
1 .  G  .  .  .
2 .  .  .  S  .
3 .  .  .  .  .
4 .  .  .  .  .
5 .  .  .  .  P
```

Where:
- `.` represents an empty position
- `G` represents the goal location at `pos12`
- `S` represents `stone1` at `pos24`
- `P` represents `player1` at `pos54`

Now, thinking about the constraints:
1. `player1` must visit `pos25`, which is just below `pos24` where the stone is.
2. After `player1` is at `pos25`, `pos22` must not be clear. This could mean the stone is pushed to `pos22`.
3. `pos34` can only be occupied once, so the player can only pass through it once.
4. `pos12` must be occupied, which is the goal.
5. Before `pos12` is occupied, the player must have been at `pos41`.

My first thought is that the player needs to push the stone upwards from `pos24` to eventually reach `pos12`. But let's check the feasibility step by step.

Looking at the grid, the player is at `pos54` and the stone is at `pos24`. The player needs to reach a position adjacent to the stone to push it. The player can reach `pos34` from `pos54` by moving upward, and then can push the stone from `pos24` to `pos23` and continue pushing it.

However, the constraint that `player1` must be at `pos25` suggests that the player might need to push the stone from below. But that would mean pushing the stone upward, which doesn't align with the direction we're trying to go.

Let's think more generally about a valid plan. We want to push `stone1` from `pos24` to `pos12`, which involves moving up and left. The player needs to be below, to the right, to the left, or above the stone to push it. 

For the constraint that says "If the player is at `pos25`, then `pos22` must not be clear", this could mean that after the player is at `pos25`, the stone should be at `pos22`. 

For the constraint that says "If `pos12` is not clear, there must be an earlier state where the player is at `pos41`", this suggests that we should visit `pos41` before pushing the stone to the goal location.

I'm going to work out a plan:

1. First, the player must move from `pos54` to a position from where it can push the stone.
2. The player can't immediately be at `pos25` because the stone is at `pos24`.
3. The player must visit `pos41` before pushing the stone to `pos12`.

Given these constraints, here's an idea:

1. The player moves from `pos54` to `pos41` (this ensures constraint #5).
2. The player then moves to a position from where it can push the stone.
3. The player eventually pushes the stone to `pos22`.
4. The player then goes to `pos25`.
5. Finally, the player pushes the stone from `pos22` to `pos12` (the goal).

Let's see if this is feasible:

From `pos54`, the player can go to `pos44`, then `pos34`, maybe to `pos33`, then to `pos43`, and up to `pos41`.
From `pos41`, the player can move to push the stone at `pos24`, maybe through `pos33` and `pos34`.
The player can push the stone upward to `pos23`, then to `pos22`.
Then the player can go to `pos25` (fulfilling the first constraint).
Finally, the player can push the stone from `pos22` to `pos12`.

Let's refine this plan more precisely. The player starts at `pos54` and the stone is at `pos24`.

In summary, the plan involves the following key steps:
1. The player moves from `pos54` to `pos41`.
2. The player moves to a position from where it can push the stone (possibly `pos34`).
3. The player pushes the stone to `pos23` and then to `pos22`.
4. The player goes to `pos25`.
5. The player pushes the stone from `pos22` to `pos12` (the goal).

Let's start detailing the moves. First, I'll trace the path from `pos54` to `pos41`.

From `pos54`, the player can go to:
- `pos44` (left)
- `pos53` (up)
- `pos55` (down)

From `pos44`, the player can go to:
- `pos34` (left)
- `pos43` (up)
- `pos45` (down)

From `pos43`, the player can go to:
- `pos33` (left)
- `pos42` (up)
- `pos44` (down)

From `pos42`, the player can go to:
- `pos32` (left)
- `pos41` (up)
- `pos43` (down)

So the path from `pos54` to `pos41` could be:
```
pos54 -> pos44 -> pos43 -> pos42 -> pos41
```

Now, from `pos41`, to get to a position from where the stone can be pushed, the player can go to `pos31`, then `pos32`, then `pos33`, and finally `pos34`. From `pos34`, the player can push the stone from `pos24` to `pos23`.

So the path from `pos41` to a position to push the stone could be:
```
pos41 -> pos31 -> pos32 -> pos33 -> pos34
```

From `pos34`, the player can push the stone to `pos23`.

From `pos23`, the player can push the stone to `pos22`.

After that, the player needs to go to `pos25`. From `pos34` (assuming the player is now at `pos34` after pushing the stone to `pos23`), the player can go to `pos35`, and then to `pos25`.

So the path from `pos34` to `pos25` could be:
```
pos34 -> pos35 -> pos25
```

From `pos25`, the player could move to a position to push the stone from `pos22` to `pos12`. This would be `pos32`, then `pos22`, then `pos21`, and then `pos11`, and finally pushing from `pos11` to `pos12`.

But there's a problem here. If the player pushes the stone to `pos22` and then tries to go to `pos25`, it's not immediately clear how to do this. 

Let's be more careful with the plan.

1. The player starts at `pos54`.
2. The player moves to `pos34`.
3. The player pushes the stone from `pos24` to `pos23`.
4. The player moves to `pos22`.
5. The player pushes the stone from `pos23` to `pos22`.
6. The player moves to `pos25`.
7. The player moves to `pos24`.
8. The player pushes the stone from `pos22` to `pos12`.

Let me check if this is a valid sequence. After step 3, the player is at `pos24` and the stone is at `pos23`. Then the player moves to `pos22`. How do we do this? One way is to go from `pos24` to `pos34`, then to `pos33`, and finally to `pos22`. But this doesn't seem immediate.

I think I'm overcomplicating things. Let's try a more direct approach. Since there's a constraint that `pos34` can be occupied (not clear) at most once, the player should only pass through `pos34` once, if possible.

Here's a simple plan:

1. The player moves from `pos54` to `pos41` (fulfilling the constraint that the player must visit `pos41` before pushing the stone to `pos12`).
2. The player moves to a position from where it can push the stone towards the goal.
3. The player pushes the stone from `pos24` to eventually reach `pos12`.

Let's trace this step by step.

Step 1: The player moves from `pos54` to `pos41`.
```
pos54 -> pos53 -> pos52 -> pos51 -> pos41
```

Step 2: The player moves to a position from where it can push the stone towards the goal. Since the stone is at `pos24` and the goal is at `pos12`, the player should try to push the stone upwards and leftwards.

From `pos41`, the player can go to:
```
pos41 -> pos42 -> pos43 -> pos44 -> pos34
```

Step 3: From `pos34`, the player can push the stone to `pos23`. After this, the player is at `pos24`.

From `pos24`, the player moves to get to a position to push the stone leftwards:
```
pos24 -> pos14
```

From `pos14`, the player can push the stone from `pos23` to `pos22`. After this, the player is at `pos23`.

Now, we need the player to be at `pos25` at some point. Let's have the player go there before pushing the stone to the goal.

```
pos23 -> pos24 -> pos25
```

Now, from `pos25`, the player needs to get to a position from where it can push the stone from `pos22` to `pos12`.

```
pos25 -> pos24 -> pos23 -> pos13
```

From `pos13`, the player can push the stone from `pos22` to `pos12`.

Great! We've worked out a plan. Let's finalize it:

1. `player1` moves from `pos54` to `pos41`.
2. `player1` moves from `pos41` to `pos34`.
3. `player1` pushes `stone1` from `pos24` to `pos23`.
4. `player1` moves from `pos24` to `pos14`.
5. `player1` pushes `stone1` from `pos23` to `pos22`.
6. `player1` moves from `pos23` to `pos25`.
7. `player1` moves from `pos25` to `pos13`.
8. `player1` pushes `stone1` from `pos22` to `pos12`.

Now, we need to translate this into the correct actions for the problem.

The available actions are:
- `"move p l_from l_to d"`: Move agent p from location l_from to location l_to following direction d.
- `"pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d"`: Make agent p, situated at location l_p, push stone s from location l_from to goal location l_to, following direction d.
- `"pushtonongoal p s l_p l_from l_to d"`: Make agent p, situated at location l_p, push stone s from location l_from to non-goal location l_to, following direction d.

The directions are:
- `dirdown`
- `dirleft`
- `dirright`
- `dirup`

Let's write out the precise sequence of actions. I'll be careful to ensure that each action's preconditions are met.

Let's re-check the path from `pos54` to `pos41`:
```
pos54 -> pos53 -> pos52 -> pos51 -> pos41
```

So the actions would be:
1. `move player1 pos54 pos53 dirup`
2. `move player1 pos53 pos52 dirup`
3. `move player1 pos52 pos51 dirup`
4. `move player1 pos51 pos41 dirleft`

The next steps involve moving from `pos41` to `pos34`:
```
pos41 -> pos42 -> pos43 -> pos44 -> pos34
```

So the actions would be:
5. `move player1 pos41 pos42 dirdown`
6. `move player1 pos42 pos43 dirdown`
7. `move player1 pos43 pos44 dirdown`
8. `move player1 pos44 pos34 dirleft`

Now, the player is at `pos34` and the stone is at `pos24`. The player can push the stone from `pos24` to `pos23`:
9. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos24 pos23 dirup`

After this, the player is at `pos24`. The player needs to move to `pos14` to push the stone again:
10. `move player1 pos24 pos14 dirleft`

From `pos14`, the player can push the stone from `pos23` to `pos22`:
11. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos14 pos23 pos22 dirleft`

After this, the player is at `pos23`. The player needs to move to `pos25`:
12. `move player1 pos23 pos24 dirdown`
13. `move player1 pos24 pos25 dirdown`

From `pos25`, the player needs to move to `pos13` to push the stone to the goal:
14. `move player1 pos25 pos24 dirup`
15. `move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup`
16. `move player1 pos23 pos13 dirleft`

From `pos13`, the player can push the stone from `pos22` to the goal location `pos12`:
17. `pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos22 pos12 dirleft`

Wait, I realize I made a mistake. The player would need to move to `pos12` to push the stone from `pos22` to `pos12`, but the player can't be at the goal location since the stone should be there. Let me rethink the last part of the plan.

If the stone is at `pos22` and the player is at `pos23`, the player can push the stone from `pos22` to `pos12` by going to `pos21`:
14. `move player1 pos23 pos22 dirleft`
15. `move player1 pos22 pos21 dirleft`
16. `pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos21 pos22 pos12 dirup`

But wait, there's a constraint that says if `player1` is at `pos25`, then `pos22` must not be clear at that state or a later state. So after the player is at `pos25`, the stone must remain at `pos22` or some other position, but `pos22` shouldn't be clear.

Let me rethink this. Maybe we can have the player go to `pos25` before it pushes the stone to `pos22`.

Here's a revised plan:

1. `player1` moves from `pos54` to `pos41`.
2. `player1` moves from `pos41` to `pos34`.
3. `player1` pushes `stone1` from `pos24` to `pos23`.
4. `player1` moves from `pos24` to `pos25`.
5. `player1` moves from `pos25` to `pos14`.
6. `player1` pushes `stone1` from `pos23` to `pos22`.
7. `player1` moves from `pos23` to `pos21`.
8. `player1` pushes `stone1` from `pos22` to `pos12`.

Let's check if this satisfies the constraints:
1. `player1` is at `pos25` in step 4.
2. After `player1` is at `pos25`, `pos22` is not clear in step 6, when the stone is pushed to `pos22`.
3. `pos34` is only occupied once, in step 2.
4. `pos12` is not clear in step 8 when the stone is there.
5. `player1` is at `pos41` in step 1, before `pos12` is not clear in step 8.

This seems to fulfill all constraints.

Problem fixed. The correct sequence is:

Let's replan the full sequence to be sure:

1. Player starts at `pos54` and the stone at `pos24`.
2. Player moves from `pos54` to `pos41`.
3. Player moves from `pos41` to `pos34`.
4. Player pushes the stone from `pos24` to `pos23`.
5. Player moves from `pos24` to `pos25`.
6. Player goes to a position from where it can push the stone from `pos23` to `pos22`. This would be `pos14`.
7. Player pushes the stone from `pos23` to `pos22`.
8. Player moves to a position from where it can push the stone from `pos22` to `pos12`. This would be `pos21`.
9. Player pushes the stone from `pos22` to `pos12`.

Let's check:

Path from `pos54` to `pos41`:
```
pos54 -> pos44 -> pos43 -> pos42 -> pos41
```

Path from `pos41` to `pos34`:
```
pos41 -> pos31 -> pos32 -> pos33 -> pos34
```

From `pos34`, we push the stone from `pos24` to `pos23` and the player ends up at `pos24`.

Path from `pos24` to `pos25`:
```
pos24 -> pos25
```

Path from `pos25` to `pos14`:
```
pos25 -> pos24 -> pos14
```

Path from `pos14` to push the stone from `pos23` to `pos22`:
We're at `pos14`, aiming to push the stone from `pos23` to `pos22`.
But `pos14` isn't adjacent to `pos23`. We need to move to a position adjacent to `pos23`. One option is `pos13`.

Actually, let me check this using the allowed movements:
- `pos14` to `pos24` following `dirright`.
- `pos14` to `pos13` following `dirup`.
- `pos14` to `pos15` following `dirdown`.

So, the player can go from `pos14` to `pos13`.
From `pos13`:
- `pos13` to `pos23` following `dirright`.
- `pos13` to `pos12` following `dirup`.
- `pos13` to `pos14` following `dirdown`.

So, the player can go from `pos13` to `pos23` following `dirright`. This is adjacent to the stone at `pos23`.

From `pos23`, the stone can be pushed to `pos22` following `dirleft`. So it's `pos23` and `pos13` we should go to, not `pos14`.

Revised path:
```
pos25 -> pos24 -> pos23 -> pos13
```

From `pos13`, the player pushes the stone from `pos23` to `pos22` following `dirleft`. After this, the player is at `pos23`.

Path from `pos23` to push the stone from `pos22` to `pos12`:
We need to move to a position adjacent to `pos22`. One option is `pos12`:

```
pos23 -> pos22 -> pos21 -> pos11 -> pos12
```

But that's the goal location! We can't have both the player and the stone at `pos12`. 

Let's check our movement directions again. From `pos21`:
- `pos21` to `pos11` following `dirleft`.
- `pos21` to `pos31` following `dirright`.
- `pos21` to `pos22` following `dirdown`.

From `pos11`:
- `pos11` to `pos21` following `dirright`.
- `pos11` to `pos12` following `dirdown`.

So, the player can go from `pos21` to `pos11` and then push the stone from `pos22` to `pos12`. But this doesn't seem right.

Actually, I'm overthinking. Let's check the available actions:
- `pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d`: Make agent p, situated at location l_p, push stone s from location l_from to goal location l_to, following direction d.

So, from `pos23`, the player can push the stone from `pos22` to the goal location `pos12` following `dirleft`. This seems correct.

Let's revise the plan once more:

1. Player starts at `pos54` and the stone at `pos24`.
2. Player moves from `pos54` to `pos41`.
3. Player moves from `pos41` to `pos34`.
4. Player pushes the stone from `pos24` to `pos23`.
5. Player moves from `pos24` to `pos25`.
6. Player moves from `pos25` to `pos13`.
7. Player pushes the stone from `pos23` to `pos22`.
8. Player pushes the stone from `pos22` to `pos12` (the goal).

I think I can actually simplify this. After pushing the stone from `pos24` to `pos23`, the player is at `pos24`. From `pos24`, the player can move directly to `pos25`. From `pos25`, the player can move to `pos15`, then to `pos14`, and finally to `pos13`.

Let's confirm the player's movements.

From `pos13`, the player should be able to push the stone from `pos23` to `pos22`. Is this correct? The player is at `pos13`, and wants to push the stone from `pos23` to `pos22`.

From `pos13`, the player can go to:
- `pos23` following `dirright`.
- `pos12` following `dirup`.
- `pos14` following `dirdown`.

From `pos13` to `pos23` follows `dirright`. From `pos23` to `pos22` follows `dirleft`. This doesn't match.

Let me check again. From `pos13`, the player can push the stone from `pos23` to `pos22` if the direction from `pos13` to `pos23` is the same as the direction from `pos23` to `pos22`. 

If we're at `pos13` and the stone is at `pos23`:
- `pos13` to `pos23` follows `dirright`.
- `pos23` to `pos22` follows `dirleft`.

These are opposite directions. Hmm, I think I've been misinterpreting the pushing action. Let's re-read the actions again.

The action `pushtonongoal p s l_p l_from l_to d` has the following preconditions:
1. Agent p is at location l_p.
2. Stone s is at location l_from.
3. Location l_to is clear.
4. You can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d.
5. You can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d.
6. Location l_to is not a goal location.

So the agent pushes the stone in the same direction as the agent's movement.

If the agent is at `pos13`, the stone is at `pos23`, and the agent wants to push the stone to `pos22`:
- The direction from `pos13` to `pos23` is `dirright`.
- The direction from `pos23` to `pos22` is `dirleft`.

These are opposite directions, so the player can't push the stone from `pos23` to `pos22` when it's at `pos13`.

How about if the player moves to `pos33` instead?
- The direction from `pos33` to `pos23` is `dirleft`.
- The direction from `pos23` to `pos22` is `dirleft`.

These match. So the player can push the stone from `pos23` to `pos22` when it's at `pos33`.

Let's revise the plan again:

1. Player starts at `pos54` and the stone at `pos24`.
2. Player moves from `pos54` to `pos41`.
3. Player moves from `pos41` to `pos34`.
4. Player pushes the stone from `pos24` to `pos23`.
5. Player moves from `pos24` to `pos25`.
6. Player moves from `pos25` to `pos33`.
7. Player pushes the stone from `pos23` to `pos22`.
8. From `pos23`, the player needs to move to a position from where it can push the stone from `pos22` to `pos12`. Let's check where that would be.

If the stone is at `pos22` and the goal is at `pos12`, the direction would be `dirup`. So the player needs to be at a position from where it can push the stone upwards.
- The direction from `pos32` to `pos22` is `dirleft`.
- The direction from `pos22` to `pos12` is `dirup`.

These don't match. Let's try `pos21`:
- The direction from `pos21` to `pos22` is `dirdown`.
- The direction from `pos22` to `pos12` is `dirup`.

These are opposite. Let's try `pos12` (but this is the goal location, so it might not work):
- The direction from `pos12` to `pos22` is `dirdown`.
- The direction from `pos22` to `pos12` is `dirup`.

These are opposite. Let's try `pos23`:
- The direction from `pos23` to `pos22` is `dirleft`.
- The direction from `pos22` to `pos12` is `dirup`.

These don't match. Let's try `pos2?` (I'm not sure if there's a `pos20`):
- The direction from `pos20` (if it exists) to `pos22` is `dirright`.
- The direction from `pos22` to `pos12` is `dirup`.

These don't match. I'm starting to think it might not be possible to push the stone directly from `pos22` to `pos12`.

Let's try another approach. From `pos22`, the stone could go to `pos21`, and then from `pos21` to `pos11`, and finally from `pos11` to `pos12`. This would be like going around to reach the goal.

From `pos22`, the player could push the stone to `pos21` by being at `pos23` (pushing leftwards). Then, from `pos21`, the player could push the stone to `pos11` by being at `pos31` (pushing leftwards again). Finally, from `pos11`, the player could push the stone to `pos12` by being at `pos10` (pushing downwards), but I'm not sure if there's a `pos10` position.

Actually, let's check if there's a location `pos11` and see what the allowed directions are:
- `You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright`.
- `You may move from location pos11 to location pos12 following direction dirdown`.

So `pos11` does exist, and it can move to `pos12` following `dirdown`. But I'm not sure if there's a `pos01` or `pos10`.

Let's look at the allowed movements from `pos11`:
- `pos11` to `pos21` following `dirright`.
- `pos11` to `pos12` following `dirdown`.

It seems like we can only move right and down from `pos11`. Which means that to push the stone from `pos11` to `pos12`, the player needs to be in a position such that going in the `dirdown` direction lands the player at `pos11`. Let me check all the allowed movements to see if there's a position above `pos11`.

Checking the allowed movements, it seems like the player can go from `pos12` to `pos11` following `dirup`. If the stone is at `pos11` and the player is at `pos12`, the player should be able to push the stone from `pos11` to `pos12` following `dirdown` (but again, the player and the stone can't be in the same position, so this is confusing).

Let me reconsider the plan. Maybe we need to try a different path.

Ah, I see the issue. The action to push a stone to a goal location is `pushtogoal`, not `pushtonongoal`. Let's revisit the preconditions for `pushtogoal`:

1. Agent p is at location l_p.
2. Stone s is at location l_from.
3. Location l_to is clear.
4. You can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d.
5. You can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d.
6. Location l_to is a goal location.

This is the same format as `pushtonongoal`, but the difference is in the last precondition. 

Let's go back to our plan:

1. Player starts at `pos54` and the stone at `pos24`.
2. Player moves from `pos54` to `pos41`.
3. Player moves from `pos41` to `pos34`.
4. Player pushes the stone from `pos24` to `pos23`.
5. Player moves from `pos24` to `pos25`.
6. Player moves from `pos25` to `pos33`.
7. Player pushes the stone from `pos23` to `pos22`.
8. Player moves to push the stone from `pos22` to `pos12`.

Let me see if there's a position from where I can push the stone from `pos22` to `pos12`. The direction from `pos22` to `pos12` is `dirup`. Not directly, because if the player is at `pos21` then the push would be downwards... hmm.

OK so we know `move player1 pos11 pos12 dirdown` is an allowed movement. Looking at the problem statement:

```
"You may move from location pos11 to location pos12 following direction dirdown"
"You may move from location pos12 to location pos11 following direction dirup"
```

so from `pos12` we can go to the location at `pos11` following the direction `dirup`. Then by symmetry, I know that to push a stone from `pos11` to `pos12`, the player needs to be in a position such that the direction from the player's position to `pos11` is `dirdown`.

Let's see if there's a `pos01` by looking at the allowed movements to `pos11`:
```
"You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright"
"You may move from location pos11 to location pos12 following direction dirdown"
```

And the allowed movements to `pos12`:
```
"You may move from location pos12 to location pos22 following direction dirright"
"You may move from location pos12 to location pos11 following direction dirup"
"You may move from location pos12 to location pos13 following direction dirdown"
```

Hmm, not seeing a `pos01` here.

I'm going to take a different approach. The current plan is to push the stone to `pos22`, and then from there to the goal. Let's see if there's a path from `pos22` to the goal `pos12`.

Direction from `pos22` to `pos12` is `dirup`. If the player is at a position such that the direction from the player's position to `pos22` is `dirup`, then the player can push the stone from `pos22` to `pos12`.

```
"You may move from location pos22 to location pos12 following direction dirleft"
```

So the direction from `pos22` to `pos12` is `dirleft`. So if the player is at a position such that the direction from the player's position to `pos22` is `dirleft`, then the player can push the stone from `pos22` to `pos12`.

But I still don't see a way to push the stone from `pos22` to `pos12` directly. Let me try to go clockwise/counter-clockwise around the grid then.

Actually, let me re-examine the allowed movements more carefully. I'm confused by how the directions are defined. Let's check the statement again. The allowed movements for `pos12` are:

```
"You may move from location pos12 to location pos22 following direction dirright"
"You may move from location pos12 to location pos11 following direction dirup"
"You may move from location pos12 to location pos13 following direction dirdown"
```

So if the player is at `pos12`, it can move to `pos22` following `dirright`. This suggests that `pos22` is to the right of `pos12`. So the grid is actually:

```
   1  2  3  4  5
1 .  G  .  .  .
2 .  .  .  S  .
3 .  .  .  .  .
4 .  .  .  .  .
5 .  .  .  .  P
```

Where `pos12` is at row 1, column 2, and `pos22` is at row 2, column 2.

Now, with this understanding, the allowed movement:
```
"You may move from location pos22 to location pos12 following direction dirleft"
```

suggests that `pos12` is to the left of `pos22`. But that doesn't make sense with the grid I've laid out.

Let me check the allowed movements again, to make sure I understand the layout.

Allowed movements for `pos11`:
```
"You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright"
"You may move from location pos11 to location pos12 following direction dirdown"
```

Allowed movements for `pos12`:
```
"You may move from location pos12 to location pos22 following direction dirright"
"You may move from location pos12 to location pos11 following direction dirup"
"You may move from location pos12 to location pos13 following direction dirdown"
```

So if we're at `pos11`, we can move to `pos21` following `dirright` (suggesting `pos21` is to the right of `pos11`), and to `pos12` following `dirdown` (suggesting `pos12` is below `pos11`).

If we're at `pos12`, we can move to `pos22` following `dirright` (suggesting `pos22` is to the right of `pos12`), to `pos11` following `dirup` (suggesting `pos11` is above `pos12`), and to `pos13` following `dirdown` (suggesting `pos13` is below `pos12`).

This layout doesn't match my understanding.

Oh! I think I understand the issue now. The positions are labeled as `posRC` where `R` is the row and `C` is the column. But the directions (up, down, left, right) are referring to the agent's movement, not the position's location. For example, `dirup` means the agent is moving up, not that the next position is above the current one.

Ok actually, I was right the first time. The grid layout is:

```
11 12 13 14 15 
21 22 23 24 25
31 32 33 34 35
41 42 43 44 45
51 52 53 54 55
```

Where the first digit is the row and the second digit is the column. So we have:

```
11 G  13 14 15
21 22 23 S  25
31 32 33 34 35
41 42 43 44 45
51 52 53 P  55
```

I'd messed up the orientation in my earlier explanation.

So if the agent is at `pos54`, then moving to `pos53` would be moving "up" (or `dirup`), moving to `pos44` would be moving "left" (or `dirleft`), and so on.

With this understanding, let's develop a plan.

1. Player starts at `pos54` and the stone at `pos24`.
2. Player moves from `pos54` to `pos41`.
3. Player moves from `pos41` to `pos34`.
4. Player pushes the stone from `pos24` to `pos23`.
5. Player moves from `pos24` to `pos25`.
6. Player moves from `pos25` to `pos33`.
7. Player pushes the stone from `pos23` to `pos22`.

After this, the player is at `pos23` and the stone is at `pos22`. To push the stone from `pos22` to `pos12`, the player needs to be at a position such that the direction from the player's position to `pos22` is the same as the direction from `pos22` to `pos12`. 

The direction from `pos22` to `pos12` is upwards (or `dirup`). So the player needs to be below `pos22`, which is at `pos32`.

From `pos23`, the player can move to `pos33`, then to `pos32`. From `pos32`, the player can push the stone from `pos22` to `pos12`.

So the revised plan is:

1. Player starts at `pos54` and the stone at `pos24`.
2. Player moves from `pos54` to `pos41`.
3. Player moves from `pos41` to `pos34`.
4. Player pushes the stone from `pos24` to `pos23`.
5. Player moves from `pos24` to `pos25`.
6. Player moves from `pos25` to `pos33`.
7. Player pushes the stone from `pos23` to `pos22`.
8. Player moves from `pos23` to `pos32`.
9. Player pushes the stone from `pos22` to `pos12` (the goal).

Let's check:

Path from `pos54` to `pos41`:
```
pos54 -> pos44 -> pos43 -> pos42 -> pos41
```

Path from `pos41` to `pos34`:
```
pos41 -> pos31 -> pos32 -> pos33 -> pos34
```

From `pos34`, we push the stone from `pos24` to `pos23`. The player is now at `pos24`.

Path from `pos24` to `pos25`:
```
pos24 -> pos25
```

Path from `pos25` to `pos33`:
```
pos25 -> pos35 -> pos34 -> pos33
```

From `pos33`, we push the stone from `pos23` to `pos22`. The player is now at `pos23`.

Path from `pos23` to `pos32`:
```
pos23 -> pos33 -> pos32
```

From `pos32`, we push the stone from `pos22` to `pos12` (the goal).

Let me verify that the player's movements in this plan don't violate the constraint that `pos34` is not clear in at most one sequence of states. The player goes through `pos34` in step 3 when moving from `pos41` to `pos34`, and then again in steps 6 when moving from `pos25` to `pos33`. This breaks the constraint.

I need to find a path from `pos25` to `pos33` that doesn't pass through `pos34`. One option is to go from `pos25` to `pos15`, then to `pos14`, `pos13`, `pos23`, and finally `pos33`. However, this seems too long. Also, I think what's meant by "one continuous segment of states" is that once the position becomes not-clear, it can only hold for a continuous segment of states, not that it can only be not-clear at most once.

Let's say the plan is:

1. Player starts at `pos54` and the stone at `pos24`.
2. Player moves to `pos41`.
3. Player moves to `pos34`.
4. Player pushes the stone from `pos24` to `pos23`.
5. Player moves to `pos25`.
6. Player moves to `pos33`.
7. Player pushes the stone from `pos23` to `pos22`.
8. Player moves to `pos32`.
9. Player pushes the stone from `pos22` to `pos12` (the goal).

The step sequences:

Step 1: Starting positions.
Step 2: Player moves from `pos54` to `pos44` to `pos43` to `pos42` to `pos41`.
Step 3: Player moves from `pos41` to `pos31` to `pos32` to `pos33` to `pos34`.
Step 4: Player pushes the stone from `pos24` to `pos23`. Player is now at `pos24`.
Step 5: Player moves from `pos24` to `pos25`.
Step 6: Player moves from `pos25` to `pos35` to `pos34` to `pos33`. Hmm, this uses `pos34` which I already used. Let me see if there's another path.

From `pos25`, the player can go to `pos35`. 
From `pos35`, the player can go to `pos34`. 
From `pos34`, the player can go to `pos33`.

Alternatively, from `pos25`, the player can go to `pos24`.
From `pos24`, the player can go to `pos23`.
From `pos23`, the player can go to `pos33`.

Let's use this second path.

Step 6: Player moves from `pos25` to `pos24` to `pos23` to `pos33`.
Step 7: Player pushes the stone from `pos23` to `pos22`. Player is now at `pos23`.
Step 8: Player moves from `pos23` to `pos33` to `pos32`.
Step 9: Player pushes the stone from `pos22` to `pos12` (the goal). Player is now at `pos22`.

This plan avoids the constraint about `pos34`.

I think this plan is solid. Let me translate it into the exact actions for the problem.

Starting at step 1:

1. `move player1 pos54 pos44 dirleft`
2. `move player1 pos44 pos43 dirup`
3. `move player1 pos43 pos42 dirup`
4. `move player1 pos42 pos41 dirup`
5. `move player1 pos41 pos31 dirleft`
6. `move player1 pos31 pos32 dirdown`
7. `move player1 pos32 pos33 dirdown`
8. `move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown`
9. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos24 pos23 dirleft`
10. `move player1 pos24 pos25 dirdown`
11. `move player1 pos25 pos24 dirup`
12. `move player1 pos24 pos23 dirleft`
13. `move player1 pos23 pos33 dirdown`
14. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos23 pos22 dirleft`
15. `move player1 pos23 pos33 dirdown`
16. `move player1 pos33 pos32 dirup`
17. `pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos22 pos12 dirup`

Actually, let me double check that the agent has to go pass through `pos41`. Looking back at the constraints, the 5th constraint says:  "If expression 'Location pos12 is not clear' holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: 'player1 is at location pos41'".

This means that the player must be at `pos41` at some point before the stone is at `pos12`. This is already satisfied by our plan, so we're good.

Let me also check that the player is at `pos25` at some point, with constraint 1: "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'player1 is at location pos25'". In our plan, the player is at `pos25` in step 10, so this is satisfied.

Constraint 2 says: "If expression 'player1 is at location pos25' holds in some state s, then expression 'Location pos22 is not clear' must hold at s or at some state after s". In our plan, after the player is at `pos25` in step 10, the stone is moved to `pos22` in step 14, so this is also satisfied.

Constraint 3 says: "The following expression must hold in at most one continuous sequence of states: 'Location pos34 is not clear'". In our plan, the player is at `pos34` in steps 8-9, then moves away and never returns to `pos34`. So this is also satisfied.

Constraint 4 says: "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'Location pos12 is not clear'". In our plan, the stone is moved to `pos12` in step 17, so this is also satisfied.

I think our plan fully satisfies all the constraints.
