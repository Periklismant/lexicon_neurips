Okay, let's try to figure out how to solve this planning problem. So, the goal is to get stone1 to a goal location. The only goal location mentioned is pos12. The initial state has the player at pos54 and stone1 at pos24. The constraints add some complexity, so I need to make sure they're all satisfied.

First, the constraints. Let's list them out:

1. The player must be at pos25 in at least one state.
2. If the player is at pos25 in some state, then pos22 must be not clear either in that state or a later one.
3. pos34 being not clear can only happen in at most one continuous sequence. So, maybe once it's occupied, it can't be cleared and reoccupied again.
4. pos12 must be not clear in at least one state.
5. If pos12 is not clear at some point, there must be an earlier state where the player was at pos41.

Hmm. So, the plan needs to handle these constraints while moving the stone to pos12.

Starting with the initial positions: player at pos54, stone1 at pos24. The stone is at pos24, which is not a goal. The goal is pos12. So the stone needs to be moved from pos24 to pos12. But moving a stone requires the player to push it. Let's think about the path.

From pos24, possible directions? Looking at the allowed moves, pos24 can go to pos14 (dirleft), pos34 (dirright), pos23 (dirup), or pos25 (dirdown). Since the goal is pos12, which is in the top-middle, maybe moving the stone upwards and leftwards.

But the player starts at pos54. So the player needs to navigate to pos24 first to push the stone. Let's see the path from pos54 to pos24.

pos54's connections: can move to pos44 (dirleft), pos53 (dirup), or pos55 (dirdown). To get to pos24, maybe moving left to pos44, then up or left? Let's check movement possibilities.

From pos54 to pos44 (dirleft), then from pos44 to pos34 (dirleft), then pos34 to pos24 (dirleft). So that's a possible path. So player1 could move pos54 → pos44 → pos34 → pos24. But each move requires the next location to be clear. Let's check:

Initial state: pos54 is occupied by the player. pos44 is clear. So first move: move player1 from pos54 to pos44 via dirleft. Then pos44 is clear? Wait, after moving, pos44 would be occupied, and pos54 becomes clear. Then from pos44, next move to pos34 (dirleft). pos34 is initially clear. Then pos34 → pos24 (dirleft). pos24 has the stone, so the player can't move directly into pos24. Wait, no. The player can only move to clear locations. So to push the stone, the player needs to be adjacent to it in the direction they want to push.

Wait, to push a stone from l_from to l_to, the player must be at l_p, which is adjacent to l_from in direction d. For example, to push a stone from pos24 to pos14 (dirleft), the player needs to be at pos24's right (dirleft direction would mean the player is to the right of l_from). Wait, the direction in the action is the direction from the player's current location to the stone's location, right? So if the player is at l_p, and they move in direction d to reach l_from (stone's location), then the stone is pushed in direction d from l_from to l_to.

So to push the stone from pos24 to pos14 (dirleft), the player needs to be at pos24's right, which is pos34 (since dirleft from pos34 to pos24 would mean the player is at pos34, direction dirleft to reach pos24. Then pushing the stone from pos24 to pos14 would require the direction from pos24 to pos14, which is dirleft. Wait, the action "pushtogoal" requires that the player is at l_p, which is adjacent to l_from (the stone's position) via direction d. Then the stone is pushed from l_from to l_to in the same direction d. So, if the player is at pos34, and the stone is at pos24, and the direction is dirleft (from player's perspective, moving left to reach pos24, then pushing the stone further left to pos14. But pos14 is a non-goal location. Wait, the goal is pos12. So maybe we need to push the stone up towards pos14, then pos14 to pos13, etc. But pos12 is the goal.

Alternatively, moving the stone from pos24 to pos23 (dirup) would require the player to be south of pos24. Wait, direction for movement: if the player is at pos25 and pushes up, but pos24 is north of pos25. Wait, directions might be a bit confusing here. Let me clarify.

The movement directions: for example, "You may move from location pos24 to location pos14 following direction dirleft". So dirleft from pos24 leads to pos14. So dirleft is west? If pos24 is (2,4), then pos14 is (1,4), so west. Similarly, dirright from pos24 would be east to pos34. Dirup from pos24 would be north to pos23 (since moving up from pos24 to pos23 is allowed, as per the movement list: "You may move from location pos24 to location pos23 following direction dirup". So dirup is north.

Wait, the grid is probably 5x5 with rows 1 to 5 and columns 1 to 5. So pos11 is row 1, column 1; pos12 is row 1, column 2; pos21 is row 2, column 1, etc. So moving dirright from pos11 (1,1) would go to pos21 (2,1)? Wait, no. Wait, the movement from pos11 to pos21 is following direction dirright. Wait, that's confusing. Because if pos11 is (1,1), moving right (east) would be to (1,2), but according to the given movement, pos11 can move to pos21 (which is row 2, column 1) via dirright. So maybe the directions are different. Maybe dirright is down, dirleft is up, etc. Alternatively, perhaps the grid is structured such that moving dirright from pos11 (which is row 1, column 1) takes you to pos12 (row 1, column 2), but according to the given movement, pos11 can move to pos21 (row 2, column 1) via dirright. Wait, that doesn't align. Hmm.

Wait, let's look at the movement from pos11. The possible moves are to pos21 (dirright) and pos12 (dirdown). So perhaps directions are:

- dirright: move to the next row (same column?), but that doesn't make sense. Or maybe dirright is east, dirdown is south, etc. But the movement from pos11 to pos21 is dirright, which would be south, but pos21 is row 2, column 1. So dirright here seems to correspond to moving down a row. Similarly, pos11 can move to pos12 via dirdown, which would be east. Wait, this is confusing. Let me think.

Alternatively, maybe the grid is numbered such that the first digit is the x-coordinate and the second is the y-coordinate, so pos11 is (x=1, y=1), pos12 is (x=1, y=2), pos21 is (x=2, y=1), etc. Then movement from pos11 to pos21 (dirright) would be moving east (increasing x by 1), and movement from pos11 to pos12 (dirdown) would be moving north (increasing y by 1). Wait, but that's counterintuitive. Alternatively, directions might be:

- dirright: east (increase x)
- dirleft: west (decrease x)
- dirup: north (increase y)
- dirdown: south (decrease y)

But according to the given movements, pos11 can move to pos21 (dirright) and pos12 (dirdown). So if pos11 is (1,1), then pos21 would be (2,1) (east), and pos12 is (1,2) (north). But moving to pos12 is via dirdown? That doesn't align. Wait, maybe the coordinates are rows and columns, but the movement directions are mapped differently. For example:

- dirright: move down a row (same column)
- dirdown: move right a column (same row)
- dirleft: move up a row
- dirup: move left a column

But this is getting complicated. Maybe the best approach is to map out the movement connections.

Looking at pos11:

- You may move from pos11 to pos21 (dirright)
- You may move from pos11 to pos12 (dirdown)

pos21 is connected to pos11 (dirleft), pos31 (dirright), pos22 (dirdown).

So pos11 to pos21 is dirright, which suggests that dirright from pos11 leads to the next row (row 2). Similarly, dirright from pos21 leads to pos31 (row 3). So dirright is moving down a row, while dirleft is moving up a row. Dirdown from pos11 goes to pos12, which is next column. So perhaps:

- dirright: row +1 (south)
- dirleft: row -1 (north)
- dirdown: column +1 (east)
- dirup: column -1 (west)

But this is a bit confusing. For example, moving from pos12 to pos22 via dirright (row increases by 1), and from pos12 to pos13 via dirdown (column increases by 1). So pos12 is (row 1, column 2). pos22 is (row 2, column 2). pos13 is (row 1, column 3). That would make sense if:

- dirright: south (row +1)
- dirleft: north (row -1)
- dirup: west (column -1)
- dirdown: east (column +1)

Yes, that seems to fit. So directions:

- dirright: south (row increases)
- dirleft: north (row decreases)
- dirdown: east (column increases)
- dirup: west (column decreases)

Wait, no. Wait, if pos12 can move to pos22 via dirright, which is row increases (south), and to pos11 via dirup (column decreases west?), and to pos13 via dirdown (column increases east). So:

pos12 (row 1, column 2) moving dirright (south) to pos22 (row 2, column 2).

pos12 moving dirup (west) to pos11 (row 1, column 1).

pos12 moving dirdown (east) to pos13 (row 1, column 3).

That makes sense. So:

- dirright: south (row +1)
- dirleft: north (row -1)
- dirup: west (column -1)
- dirdown: east (column +1)

So, directions are:

- dirright: south
- dirleft: north
- dirup: west
- dirdown: east

Wait, that's a bit counterintuitive, but based on the movement examples, that's how it's structured.

So with that in mind, the player starts at pos54 (row 5, column 4). The stone is at pos24 (row 2, column 4). The goal is pos12 (row 1, column 2), which is a goal location.

The player needs to get to the stone and push it to pos12. But there are constraints to satisfy.

First, the player must be at pos25 (row 2, column 5) in at least one state. Also, when that happens, pos22 (row 2, column 2) must be not clear either then or later. Another constraint is that pos12 must be not clear at some point, which would happen when the stone is moved there. But also, if pos12 is not clear, the player must have been at pos41 (row 4, column 1) before. Additionally, pos34 (row3, column4) can only be occupied in at most one continuous sequence.

Let's outline the steps:

1. Move the player from pos54 to pos24 to push the stone. But how?

The player is at pos54. To get to pos24, which is row 2, column4. Let's see the possible path.

pos54 (row5, column4) can move dirleft (north) to pos44 (row4, column4). Then from pos44, dirleft (north) to pos34 (row3, column4). Then dirleft (north) to pos24 (row2, column4). But pos24 has the stone. So the player can't move into pos24 because it's not clear. So instead, the player needs to approach from a direction that allows pushing.

To push the stone from pos24 to pos14 (dirleft, which is north, row decreases by 1), the player needs to be south of pos24 (dirright from the player's perspective) to push north. Wait, according to the movement rules, to push the stone from l_from (pos24) to l_to (pos14) with direction d (dirleft), the player must be at l_p such that moving from l_p to l_from is direction d. So if the direction is dirleft (north), then l_p must be south of l_from (pos24). Because dirleft from l_p would take you to l_from. Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, the action "pushtogoal" requires that the player can get from l_p to l_from following direction d. So if the player is at l_p and moves in direction d to reach l_from (where the stone is), then the stone is pushed in the same direction d from l_from to l_to. So direction d is the direction from l_p to l_from, which is also the direction the stone is pushed.

For example, if the player is at pos34 (row3, column4) and wants to push the stone at pos24 (row2, column4) in direction dirleft (north), then the direction from pos34 to pos24 is dirleft (north). So the player moves from pos34 (l_p) to pos24 (l_from) via dirleft, and pushes the stone to pos14 (l_to) via dirleft. But pos14 is a non-goal location, so that's not helpful. But the goal is to get the stone to pos12, which is a goal.

Alternatively, pushing the stone from pos24 to pos23 (dirup, which is west, column decreases by 1). To do that, the player needs to be east of pos24 (column5?), but pos24 is column4. Wait, no. To push the stone west (dirup), the player needs to be east of the stone (column5) and move west (dirup) to reach the stone's position. So l_p would be pos25 (row2, column5). Because from pos25, moving dirup (west) would take you to pos24 (since pos25 is row2, column5; moving west (dirup) to column4, which is pos24). Then pushing the stone from pos24 to pos23 (dirup, west) would move it to pos23 (row2, column3). But pos23 is not a goal. But maybe that's part of the path.

But pushing the stone from pos24 to pos23 (dirup) would require the player to be at pos25 (l_p), moving dirup to pos24 (l_from), then pushing the stone to pos23 (l_to). But pos25 is clear initially. So the player can move to pos25, then perform pushtonongoal (since pos23 is not a goal). But this might help in moving the stone towards pos12.

But let's think about the constraints. The player must be at pos25 in at least one state. So perhaps pushing the stone from pos24 to pos23 via pos25 is a way to satisfy that constraint. Also, when the player is at pos25, the constraint requires that pos22 is not clear either at that state or later. pos22 is clear initially. How can pos22 become not clear? Either the player or a stone is there. Since the stone is at pos24 initially, moving it to pos23 would not affect pos22. But if later the stone is moved to pos22, then pos22 would be not clear. But pos22 is not a goal, so we can't push the stone there as a goal. But perhaps during the process, the stone passes through pos22.

Alternatively, the player could go to pos22 after pos25, making pos22 not clear. But that's possible. For example, after pushing the stone from pos24 to pos23, the player is at pos24 (after pushing). Then move to pos23, then to pos22, etc. But that may take time.

But let's try to outline a possible path.

Option 1:

Player moves from pos54 to pos44 (dirleft), then to pos34 (dirleft), then to pos24 (dirleft) — but pos24 has the stone, so can't move there. So instead, the player could move around to reach pos25, then push the stone west to pos23.

How to get to pos25:

From pos54, move down to pos55 (dirdown), but pos55 is clear. Then from pos55, move up (dirup) to pos54 again. That's not helpful. Alternatively, pos54 can move dirleft to pos44, then dirup (west?) to pos43? Wait, pos44's connections: You can move to pos34 (dirleft/north), pos54 (dirright/south?), pos43 (dirup/west), or pos45 (dirdown/east). Wait, according to the movement list, from pos44, you can move to pos34 (dirleft), pos54 (dirright), pos43 (dirup), or pos45 (dirdown). So dirup from pos44 is to pos43 (row4, column3), and dirdown to pos45 (row4, column5).

So the player is at pos54. Move dirleft to pos44. Then from pos44, move dirup to pos43. Then from pos43, move dirup to pos42. Then from pos42, move dirup to pos41. Then from pos41, move dirright to pos51. Wait, this seems complicated. Alternatively, maybe a different route.

Wait, the player needs to get to pos25. Let's find a path from pos54 to pos25.

pos54 → pos44 (dirleft)
pos44 → pos34 (dirleft)
pos34 → pos24 (dirleft)
But pos24 has the stone. So can't move into pos24. Alternatively, from pos34, move dirdown (east) to pos35. Then from pos35, move dirleft (north) to pos25. Wait:

pos34 (row3, column4) can move dirdown (east) to pos35 (row3, column5). Then from pos35, dirleft (north) to pos25 (row2, column5). That's possible. So:

1. move player1 from pos54 to pos44 (dirleft)
2. move player1 from pos44 to pos34 (dirleft)
3. move player1 from pos34 to pos35 (dirdown)
4. move player1 from pos35 to pos25 (dirleft)

Now, the player is at pos25, satisfying the first constraint. Now, in this state, pos22 is still clear. So the second constraint requires that pos22 must be not clear either now or later. So we need to ensure that after the player is at pos25, pos22 becomes occupied at some point.

After reaching pos25, the player can push the stone from pos24 to pos23 (dirup). To do that:

Check preconditions for pushtonongoal:

- player is at l_p (pos25)
- stone is at l_from (pos24)
- l_to (pos23) is clear
- can move from l_p (pos25) to l_from (pos24) via direction d (dirup). Wait, dirup from pos25 is west (column decreases by 1), so pos25 to pos24 is dirup. Then pushing the stone from pos24 to pos23 via dirup (west). So:

Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos25 pos24 pos23 dirup

After this action, the player moves to pos24, stone moves to pos23. Then, pos25 becomes clear, pos24 is now occupied by the player, pos23 has the stone.

Now, the stone is at pos23. Next, need to push it towards pos12. From pos23, possible pushes:

To pos13 (dirup/west), pos22 (dirup/south?), or pos24 (dirdown/east). Wait, according to movement directions from pos23:

"You may move from location pos23 to location pos13 following direction dirleft (north), pos33 (dirright/south?), pos22 (dirup/west), or pos24 (dirdown/east). Wait, this is getting confusing again. Let's check the movement list:

From pos23, you can move to pos13 (dirleft/north), pos33 (dirright/south), pos22 (dirup/west), or pos24 (dirdown/east).

So to push the stone from pos23 to pos13 (dirleft/north), the player would need to be south of pos23 (pos33), but that's not helpful. Alternatively, pushing west to pos22 (dirup) would require the player to be east of pos23 (pos24). Since the player is currently at pos24 after pushing the stone to pos23, they can move to pos23's east (pos24) and push west. Wait, but the player is already at pos24. To push the stone from pos23 to pos22 (dirup/west), the player needs to be at pos23's east (pos24) and move west (dirup) to pos23. Then push the stone west to pos22. But pos22 is not a goal, so that's allowed.

So the player is at pos24. To push the stone from pos23 to pos22:

Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos23 pos22 dirup

Preconditions:

- player at pos24 (yes)
- stone at pos23 (yes)
- pos22 is clear (initially yes)
- can move from pos24 to pos23 via dirup (west). Yes, since pos24 to pos23 is allowed via dirup (west).
- pos22 is not a goal (yes).

So after this action:

- player moves to pos23
- stone moves to pos22
- pos24 becomes clear
- pos22 is now occupied by the stone.

Now, the stone is at pos22. Next, push it to pos12. pos12 is a goal location. So we can use pushtogoal.

To push from pos22 to pos12 (dirleft/north), the player needs to be south of pos22 (pos32), but that's not possible yet. Alternatively, the player is at pos23 and can move to pos22 (dirup/west) to pos22. Wait, but the stone is at pos22. The player needs to be adjacent to the stone in the direction they want to push.

Wait, to push the stone from pos22 to pos12 (dirleft/north), the player needs to be south of pos22 (pos32), and push north. So player moves from pos32 to pos22 (dirleft/north), then push the stone north to pos12.

But the player is currently at pos23. How to get to pos32?

From pos23, the player can move to pos13 (dirleft/north), pos33 (dirright/south), pos22 (dirup/west), or pos24 (dirdown/east). But pos22 has the stone, so can't move there. pos24 is clear. So:

Player moves from pos23 to pos24 (dirdown/east). Then from pos24, move to pos34 (dirright/south). Then to pos33 (dirleft/north?), wait, perhaps a better path.

Alternatively, from pos23, move to pos33 (dirright/south). Then to pos32 (dirup/west). Then from pos32, push the stone north to pos22, but the stone is already there. Wait, the stone is at pos22. We need to push it to pos12.

Wait, the stone is at pos22. To push it to pos12 (dirleft/north), the player needs to be at pos22's south (pos32) and push north. So the player needs to get to pos32.

Current player position is pos23. Path to pos32:

pos23 → pos33 (dirright/south)
pos33 → pos32 (dirup/west)
Now at pos32. Then push stone from pos22 to pos12:

Action: pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos22 pos12 dirleft

Check preconditions:

- player at pos32 (yes)
- stone at pos22 (yes)
- pos12 is clear (initially yes)
- can move from pos32 to pos22 via dirleft (north)
- can move from pos22 to pos12 via dirleft (north) (since pos22 to pos12 is allowed via dirleft)
- pos12 is a goal (yes)

So this action is valid. After performing it:

- player moves to pos22
- stone moves to pos12 (goal achieved)
- pos32 becomes clear
- pos12 is now occupied by stone1.

Now the stone is at the goal. Now, check the constraints:

1. Player was at pos25 (yes, step 4)
2. When player was at pos25, pos22 must become not clear. After pushing the stone to pos22 (step 6), pos22 is not clear. So that satisfies the constraint.
3. pos34 being not clear in at most one continuous sequence. When did pos34 get occupied? The player moved through pos34 when going from pos44 to pos34 (step 2), then to pos35 (step3). So pos34 was occupied once. If any other time pos34 is occupied, it must be part of the same continuous sequence. But in this plan, pos34 is only occupied during steps 2 and 3. So that's one continuous sequence. Okay.
4. pos12 is not clear (yes, after step8, the stone is there)
5. Before pos12 is not clear, the player was at pos41. Wait, this constraint says that if pos12 is not clear in some state, there must be an earlier state where player was at pos41. But in our current plan, the player hasn't been to pos41. So this constraint is not satisfied. Oops, that's a problem.

So the plan needs to include the player visiting pos41 before pos12 becomes not clear. So how to include that?

Hmm, that complicates things. So after achieving the goal of getting the stone to pos12, we need to ensure that before that, the player was at pos41.

So the player needs to go to pos41 at some point before pushing the stone to pos12. How?

Let's think. Maybe after moving the stone to pos22, the player can detour to pos41 before proceeding to push to pos12.

But how? Let's retrace.

After step6, the stone is at pos22. The player is at pos23. Then in step7, the player moves to pos24, then to pos34, pos33, pos32, etc. But to get to pos41, which is row4, column1.

Possible path from pos23 to pos41:

pos23 → pos13 (dirleft/north)
pos13 → pos12 (dirup/west)
But pos12 is clear. Then pos12 → pos11 (dirup/west)
pos11 → pos21 (dirright/south)
pos21 → pos31 (dirright/south)
pos31 → pos41 (dirright/south)

But this would take a lot of steps. Then from pos41, the player needs to return to pos32 to push the stone to pos12. But this would make the plan longer, but necessary to satisfy the constraint.

Alternatively, after step4 (player at pos25), they can move to pos41 before pushing the stone. But how?

From pos25, possible moves:

pos25 can move to pos15 (dirleft/north), pos35 (dirright/south), or pos24 (dirup/west). So player is at pos25. To get to pos41, which is row4, column1.

From pos25, move to pos35 (dirright/south), then to pos45 (dirright/south), then pos45 to pos44 (dirup/west), then pos44 to pos43 (dirup/west), pos43 to pos42 (dirup/west), pos42 to pos41 (dirup/west). That's a long path. But maybe necessary.

So steps after step4 (player at pos25):

5. move player1 from pos25 to pos35 (dirright)
6. move from pos35 to pos45 (dirright)
7. move from pos45 to pos44 (dirup)
8. move from pos44 to pos43 (dirup)
9. move from pos43 to pos42 (dirup)
10. move from pos42 to pos41 (dirup)

Now player is at pos41, satisfying the constraint for pos12. Then the player needs to go back to pos32 to push the stone.

But after step10, the player is at pos41. Then need to go back to pos32. Path from pos41 to pos32:

pos41 → pos31 (dirleft/north)
pos31 → pos21 (dirleft/north)
pos21 → pos22 (dirdown/east)
pos22 has the stone, so can't move there. So alternative path:

pos41 → pos42 (dirdown/east)
pos42 → pos43 (dirdown/east)
pos43 → pos44 (dirdown/east)
pos44 → pos34 (dirleft/north)
pos34 → pos33 (dirup/west)
pos33 → pos32 (dirup/west)

This is a long path, but necessary.

Then, after reaching pos32, push the stone from pos22 to pos12.

But this adds a lot of steps, making the plan longer. But the constraints require that the player was at pos41 before pos12 becomes not clear. So this is necessary.

So integrating this into the plan:

Original steps 1-4: player reaches pos25.

Then steps 5-10: player moves to pos41.

Then steps 11-...: player returns to pos32 to push the stone to pos12.

But this makes the plan much longer. However, the problem requires an optimal plan (shortest possible). So perhaps there's a smarter way to visit pos41 earlier.

Alternative approach: Initially, the player starts at pos54. Instead of going directly towards the stone, maybe take a detour to pos41 first.

So:

1. move from pos54 to pos44 (dirleft)
2. move from pos44 to pos43 (dirup)
3. move from pos43 to pos42 (dirup)
4. move from pos42 to pos41 (dirup)

Now player is at pos41. Then proceed to move towards pos25.

From pos41:

5. move to pos42 (dirdown)
6. move to pos43 (dirdown)
7. move to pos44 (dirdown)
8. move to pos34 (dirleft)
9. move to pos35 (dirdown)
10. move to pos25 (dirleft)

Now player is at pos25. Then proceed to push the stone from pos24 to pos23 as before. Then from pos24, move to pos34, pos35, etc.

But this way, the player has already visited pos41 before any action that makes pos12 not clear. Because pos12 is only not clear after the final push, which is after the player has been to pos41.

This way, the constraint is satisfied. But the plan becomes longer. However, maybe this is the only way.

But let's see:

Original plan without visiting pos41 was 8 steps. Adding the detour to pos41 adds steps 1-4 and modifies the path to pos25. Let's count:

Steps to visit pos41 first:

1. move player1 pos54 pos44 dirleft
2. move player1 pos44 pos43 dirup
3. move player1 pos43 pos42 dirup
4. move player1 pos42 pos41 dirup

Now at pos41. Then:

5. move player1 pos41 pos42 dirdown
6. move player1 pos42 pos43 dirdown
7. move player1 pos43 pos44 dirdown
8. move player1 pos44 pos34 dirleft
9. move player1 pos34 pos35 dirdown
10. move player1 pos35 pos25 dirleft

Now at pos25 (step10). Then push the stone:

11. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos25 pos24 pos23 dirup

Then the player is at pos24. Then:

12. move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright
13. move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup
14. move player1 pos33 pos32 dirup

Now at pos32. Push the stone from pos23 to pos22:

15. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos23 pos22 dirleft

But wait, the stone is at pos23, and the player is at pos32. To push from pos23 to pos22 (dirleft/north), the player needs to be south of pos23 (pos33). So step14 is pos33 to pos32, but that's not helpful. Maybe I made a mistake here.

Wait, after step11, the stone is at pos23, player at pos24.

Then the player needs to get to pos23's east (pos24) to push west to pos22.

But after step11, player is at pos24. So:

12. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos23 pos22 dirup

Now stone is at pos22, player at pos23.

Then player needs to get to pos32 to push to pos12.

From pos23:

13. move player1 pos23 pos33 dirright
14. move player1 pos33 pos32 dirup

Now at pos32. Then push:

15. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos22 pos12 dirleft

Now stone is at pos12, satisfying the goal.

This plan has 15 steps, but let's check constraints:

- Player was at pos25 (step10): yes
- When at pos25, pos22 must be not clear later. After step15, pos22 is clear (stone moved to pos12), but after step12, stone is at pos22. So pos22 is not clear from step12 until step15. So the constraint is satisfied.
- pos34 is clear except when player is moving through it. Steps8 (pos34), step12 (player moves from pos24 to pos34?), no. Wait, after step11, player is at pos24. Then step12 is pushing from pos24 to pos23, player moves to pos23. Then steps13 and14 to get to pos32. So pos34 is only occupied during step8 (player at pos34) and step9 (moving to pos35). So continuous from step8 to step9. Then no other occupation. So the constraint is satisfied.
- pos12 is not clear after step15: yes.
- Before step15, player was at pos41 in step4: yes.

So this plan satisfies all constraints. But is there a shorter way?

Alternatively, can the player visit pos41 while moving towards pos25, reducing the number of steps?

For example, after step4 (pos41), moving towards pos25 via a different path.

But it's challenging. Let's see. The player needs to go from pos41 to pos25. The shortest path would be:

pos41 → pos42 → pos43 → pos44 → pos34 → pos35 → pos25. That's 6 moves. Which is what we did in steps5-10.

So that's the shortest path.

Alternatively, after step4 (pos41), can the player move to pos51, then pos52, pos53, pos54, but that's not helpful.

No, the shortest path is through pos42, pos43, pos44, etc.

So the total steps would be 15. But maybe there's a more optimal path.

Wait, perhaps after visiting pos41, the player can move directly to pos25 via a different route. For example:

pos41 → pos31 (dirleft)
pos31 → pos21 (dirleft)
pos21 → pos22 (dirdown)
pos22 has the stone? No, in this scenario, the stone is still at pos24.

Wait, after visiting pos41 (step4), the stone is still at pos24. So pos22 is clear. So player can move from pos21 to pos22. Then from pos22 to pos23, pos24, etc. But how to get from pos41 to pos25 quickly.

pos41 → pos31 (dirleft)
pos31 → pos21 (dirleft)
pos21 → pos22 (dirdown)
pos22 → pos23 (dirdown)
pos23 → pos24 (dirdown)
pos24 is occupied by the stone. So player can't move there. So maybe this path doesn't work.

Alternatively, pos41 → pos42 (dirdown)
pos42 → pos43 (dirdown)
pos43 → pos44 (dirdown)
pos44 → pos34 (dirleft)
pos34 → pos35 (dirdown)
pos35 → pos25 (dirleft)

This is the same as before, 6 steps from pos41 to pos25.

So total steps would be:

1. move to pos44
2. move to pos43
3. move to pos42
4. move to pos41 (now at pos41)
5. move to pos42
6. move to pos43
7. move to pos44
8. move to pos34
9. move to pos35
10. move to pos25
11. push stone from pos24 to pos23
12. push stone from pos23 to pos22
13. move to pos33
14. move to pos32
15. push stone to pos12

Wait, step12 is another push. So total steps would be 15. But perhaps some steps can be merged.

Alternatively, after step11 (stone at pos23, player at pos24), the player can move to pos34 (step12), then to pos33 (step13), then to pos32 (step14), then push to pos12 (step15). That's 15 steps.

But maybe there's a way to have fewer steps.

Wait, let's think of the steps again:

Original plan with detour to pos41:

1. move pos54 to pos44 (dirleft)
2. move pos44 to pos43 (dirup)
3. move pos43 to pos42 (dirup)
4. move pos42 to pos41 (dirup)
5. move pos41 to pos42 (dirdown)
6. move pos42 to pos43 (dirdown)
7. move pos43 to pos44 (dirdown)
8. move pos44 to pos34 (dirleft)
9. move pos34 to pos35 (dirdown)
10. move pos35 to pos25 (dirleft)
11. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos25 pos24 pos23 dirup
12. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos23 pos22 dirup
13. move pos23 to pos33 (dirright)
14. move pos33 to pos32 (dirup)
15. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos22 pos12 dirleft

That's 15 actions. But is this the optimal plan?

Is there a way to reduce the steps? For example, after step4 (player at pos41), can the player move directly to pos25 via a shorter path? Unlikely. So this might be the minimal steps needed.

Alternatively, maybe combine some movements. For example, after step11, the player is at pos24. Then move to pos34 (dirright), pos34 to pos33 (dirup), pos33 to pos32 (dirup). That's three moves. Then push to pos12.

But perhaps the pushtonongoal actions can be used to move the player closer.

Another idea: After pushing the stone from pos24 to pos23 (step11), the player is at pos24. Instead of pushing to pos22, can the player move to pos34, then to pos33, pos32, and push from there.

But the stone is at pos23. To push it to pos13 (dirleft), the player needs to be at pos24's north (pos23's south? No, pos23 is at row2, column3. To push north from pos23 to pos13, the player needs to be south of pos23 (pos33). So the player moves to pos33, then push north.

But that would require:

After step11, player is at pos24. Then:

12. move to pos34 (dirright)
13. move to pos33 (dirup)
14. push stone from pos23 to pos13 (dirleft)
15. move to pos23 (dirup)
16. push from pos13 to pos12 (dirleft)

But pos13 is not a goal. Then push to pos12 (which is a goal). So:

After step14, stone at pos13. Then player moves to pos12's south (pos22) and pushes north.

But pos22 is clear. So player can move from pos13 to pos12 (but pos12 is clear). Wait, no. The player can move from pos13 to pos12 via dirdown (east). Then from pos12, push north to pos11, but that's not helpful.

Hmm, perhaps this approach isn't better. 

Alternatively, after step11, the player is at pos24. From there, move to pos34, pos33, pos32. Then push the stone from pos23 to pos22 (dirup) requires the player to be at pos23's east (pos24), which they already are. So step12: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos23 pos22 dirup. Then stone is at pos22, player at pos23.

Then from pos23, move to pos33, then pos32. Then push to pos12.

So steps:

12. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos23 pos22 dirup
13. move player1 pos23 pos33 dirright
14. move player1 pos33 pos32 dirup
15. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos22 pos12 dirleft

That's three steps after step11, which matches the previous plan.

So total steps: 15.

I think this is the minimal plan considering the constraints. Now, checking all constraints:

- Player is at pos25 (step10)
- When that happens, pos22 becomes not clear in step12 (stone at pos22)
- pos34 is not clear during steps8 and9 (continuous)
- pos12 is not clear after step15
- Before step15, player was at pos41 (step4)

All constraints are satisfied. Now, let's write the plan in the required format.
