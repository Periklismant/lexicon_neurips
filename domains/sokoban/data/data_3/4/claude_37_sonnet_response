Let me break down the problem:

1. We have a 2D grid with an agent (player1), a stone, and some goal locations.
2. The task is to push the stone to a goal location.
3. Available actions: move the agent, push the stone to a goal location, or push the stone to a non-goal location.
4. There are some constraints we need to satisfy along the way.

Let's first understand the grid layout. The positions are labeled as posXY where X is the row and Y is the column. So, pos11 is at the top-left, and pos55 is at the bottom-right. I'll create a visual representation of the grid to help me think:

Initial state:
```
1 _ _ _ _ _
2 _ _ _ _ P
3 _ S _ _ _
4 _ _ _ _ _
5 _ _ _ _ _
```

Where:
- P is player1 (at pos25)
- S is stone1 (at pos32)

I also note that pos12 is the only goal location mentioned in the initial state. So, we need to push stone1 to pos12.

Now, let's think about the constraints:

1. "Location pos55 is not clear" should be true in at least one state. This means player1 or stone1 should be at pos55 at some point.
2. "player1 is at location pos23" should be true in at least one state.
3. If player1 is at pos23, there must be an earlier state where either "Location pos53 is not clear" or "player1 is at location pos44" is true.
4. "player1 is at location pos24" should be true in at least one state.
5. If player1 is at pos24, then at that state or later, either "Location pos45 is not clear" or "stone1 is at location pos11" should be true.

Let's think about a general strategy:

1. Move the player to be adjacent to the stone.
2. Push the stone towards pos12 (the goal).
3. Ensure we satisfy all constraints along the way.

Now, let's trace through possible paths to see how we can satisfy all constraints while achieving the goal.

Given that the stone is at pos32, and we need to get it to pos12, one natural path would be: 
pos32 -> pos22 -> pos12

But we also need to ensure that the constraints are satisfied. Let me try to map out a more detailed plan.

First, to satisfy the constraint that pos55 should not be clear at some point, we can simply have the player move to pos55.

Let's start tracing a plan:

The player starts at pos25:
- First, let's move the player to pos55 to satisfy the first constraint: Move player1 from pos25 to pos35 following dirright, then pos45, then pos55.
- Then, we need to get the player to pos24 at some point, and ensure that later on, "Location pos45 is not clear" or "stone1 is at location pos11" is true. Given that we need to push the stone to pos12, having the stone at pos11 is a potential path.
- We also need the player to be at pos23 at some point, and ensure that earlier, "Location pos53 is not clear" or "player1 is at location pos44" is true.

Alright, let's sketch a high-level plan:

1. Move the player to pos55.
2. Then, move to pos44.
3. Move to pos24.
4. Move to pos23.
5. Position the player to push the stone from pos32 towards pos12.
6. Push the stone to the goal.

This should satisfy all the constraints while achieving the goal. Now, let's detail the exact sequence of actions.

But wait, there's a problem. The initial state says "Location pos25 is clear" and "Location pos32 is clear", which contradicts "player1 is at location pos25" and "stone1 is at location pos32". This is confusing. Let's assume that the initial state is correct and these two additional statements are in error:
- ~~"Location pos25 is clear"~~
- ~~"Location pos32 is clear"~~

Let's review the initial state again:
- player1 is at pos25
- stone1 is at pos32
- All other locations are clear
- pos12 is a goal location
- We're given adjacency relationships

I think I've been looking at the grid backwards. Let me update my visual:

Initial state:
```
  1 2 3 4 5
1 _ G _ _ _
2 _ _ _ _ _
3 _ S _ _ _
4 _ _ _ _ _
5 _ _ _ _ P
```

Where:
- P is player1 (at pos25)
- S is stone1 (at pos32)
- G is a goal location (at pos12)

But this doesn't look right to me, because it doesn't match the adjacency relationships. Let me re-interpret:

- Given that we can move from pos11 to pos21 following direction dirright, dirright seems to be moving from the first column to the second (rightward).
- Similarly, with pos11 to pos12 following direction dirdown, dirdown seems to be moving from the first row to the second (downward).

So, posXY has X as the column and Y as the row. Let's update the visual:

Initial state:
```
  1 2 3 4 5
1 _ _ _ _ _
2 G _ _ _ _
3 _ S _ _ _
4 _ _ _ _ _
5 _ _ _ _ P
```

Where:
- P is player1 (at position pos25, which is column 2, row 5)
- S is stone1 (at position pos32, which is column 3, row 2)
- G is a goal location (at position pos12, which is column 1, row 2)

Actually, this still doesn't match the adjacency relationships. Let me try again:

- If we can move from pos11 to pos21 following dirright, then it seems dirright increases the first number (from 1 to 2).
- If we can move from pos11 to pos12 following dirdown, then it seems dirdown increases the second number (from 1 to 2).

So, posXY has X as the row and Y as the column. Let's update the visual:

Initial state:
```
  1 2 3 4 5
1 _ _ _ _ _
2 _ _ _ _ P
3 _ S _ _ _
4 _ _ _ _ _
5 _ _ _ _ _
```

And the goal is at pos12, which is row 1, column 2. But that doesn't match with the adjacent relationships. I'm a bit confused.

Ok, let's look at some of the adjacencies closely to determine the layout:

"You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright" - here, moving right means going from (1, 1) to (2, 1), so the first digit is the x-coordinate (column).

"You may move from location pos11 to location pos12 following direction dirdown" - here, moving down means going from (1, 1) to (1, 2), so the second digit is the y-coordinate (row).

So, posXY has X as the column and Y as the row. This is the correct interpretation. Let me redrawn the grid:

Initial state:
```
    1 2 3 4 5
  -------------
1 | _ _ _ _ _
2 | G _ _ _ _
3 | _ S _ _ _
4 | _ _ _ _ _
5 | _ P _ _ _
```

Where:
- P is player1 (at position pos25, which is column 2, row 5)
- S is stone1 (at position pos32, which is column 3, row 2)
- G is a goal location (at position pos12, which is column 1, row 2)

With this layout, to move the stone to the goal, we'd need to push it left from pos32 to pos22, then to pos12. So the stone is going to the left.

Let's check that again to make sure: 
"You may move from location pos32 to location pos22 following direction dirleft" - Confirmed: going from (3, 2) to (2, 2) is moving left.

Given our constraints:
1. The player should be at pos55 at some point (to make it not clear).
2. The player should be at pos23.
3. Before the player is at pos23, either pos53 is not clear or the player is at pos44.
4. The player should be at pos24.
5. After the player is at pos24, either pos45 is not clear or the stone is at pos11.

Let's think about a path. Since the stone starts at pos32 and the goal is at pos12, we want to push the stone to the left. The player is at pos25, so from there we need to go up to get to the stone.

One potential plan is:
1. Move the player to pos55 (satisfying constraint 1).
2. Move the player to pos44 (to satisfy the prerequisite for constraint 3).
3. Move the player to pos24.
4. Move the player to pos23 (satisfying constraints 3 and 2).
5. Move the player to pos33 (to position for pushing the stone).
6. Push the stone from pos32 to pos22.
7. Move the player to get in position to push the stone from pos22 to pos12.
8. Push the stone from pos22 to pos12 (the goal).

I'll trace through this action by action:

Player (P) starts at pos25, Stone (S) at pos32, Goal (G) at pos12.

10. move player1 pos33 pos32 dirup

Hmm, but pos32 has the stone, so we can't move there directly. We need to move around to position ourselves for pushing. I'll adjust the plan.

4 | _ _ _ _ _

```

Hmm, I realize I made a mistake: position pos13 means column 1, row 3 - not column 3, row 1. Let me revise:

9. move player1 pos23 pos13 dirleft
```
    1 2 3 4 5
  -------------
1 | _ _ _ _ _
2 | G _ S _ _
3 | P _ _ _ _
4 | _ _ _ _ _
5 | _ _ _ _ _
```

Actually, let me follow a different approach. Since the player is at pos23 (column 2, row 3), the stone is at pos32 (column 3, row 2), and we want to push the stone to the left, we need to position the player to the right of the stone (at pos42). 

I'll trace out a new plan from here:

```
    1 2 3 4 5
  -------------
1 | _ _ _ _ _
2 | G _ S _ _
3 | _ P _ _ _
4 | _ _ _ _ _
5 | _ _ _ _ _
```

Player is at pos23, Stone at pos32, Goal at pos12.

9. move player1 pos23 pos33 dirright
```
    1 2 3 4 5
  -------------
1 | _ _ _ _ _
2 | G _ S _ _
3 | _ _ P _ _
4 | _ _ _ _ _
5 | _ _ _ _ _
```

10. move player1 pos33 pos43 dirright
```
    1 2 3 4 5
  -------------
1 | _ _ _ _ _
2 | G _ S _ _
3 | _ _ _ P _
4 | _ _ _ _ _
5 | _ _ _ _ _
```

11. move player1 pos43 pos42 dirup
```
    1 2 3 4 5
  -------------
1 | _ _ _ _ _
2 | G _ S P _
3 | _ _ _ _ _
4 | _ _ _ _ _
5 | _ _ _ _ _
```

12. Now we're in a position to push the stone from pos32 to pos22:
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos22 dirleft

```
    1 2 3 4 5
  -------------
1 | _ _ _ _ _
2 | G S P _ _
3 | _ _ _ _ _
4 | _ _ _ _ _
5 | _ _ _ _ _
```

13. Push the stone to the goal:
pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos22 pos12 dirleft

```
    1 2 3 4 5
  -------------
1 | _ _ _ _ _
2 | S P _ _ _
3 | _ _ _ _ _
4 | _ _ _ _ _
5 | _ _ _ _ _
```

Wait, there's a problem. The stone is now at a goal position (pos12), but the position pos12 is where the goal is. Let me correct:

To say the stone is at a goal location, I should have pushed it to pos12.

Let's recap: The stone (S) starts at pos32, the player (P) starts at pos25, and the goal (G) is at pos12.

After actions 1-11 as outlined above, the grid is:

```
    1 2 3 4 5
  -------------
1 | _ _ _ _ _
2 | G _ S P _
3 | _ _ _ _ _
4 | _ _ _ _ _
5 | _ _ _ _ _
```

12. Now we're in a position to push the stone from pos32 to pos22:
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos22 dirleft

```
    1 2 3 4 5
  -------------
1 | _ _ _ _ _
2 | G S P _ _
3 | _ _ _ _ _
4 | _ _ _ _ _
5 | _ _ _ _ _
```

13. Now we need to push the stone from pos22 to pos12 (goal location):
pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos22 pos12 dirleft

```
    1 2 3 4 5
  -------------
1 | _ _ _ _ _
2 | S P _ _ _
3 | _ _ _ _ _
4 | _ _ _ _ _
5 | _ _ _ _ _
```

Now, the stone is at pos12, which is a goal location, so the task is accomplished.

But wait! I need to check if I missed any constraints. Specifically, constraint 5: If the player is at pos24, then at that state or later, either pos45 is not clear or the stone is at pos11. Let me see...

The player was at pos24 in step 7 of my solution. After that, the stone was at pos32, pos22, and finally at pos12. It's never at pos11. And pos45 was clear from step 4 onwards. So, this constraint is not satisfied.

I need to reconsider and ensure all constraints are satisfied.

Let's revise my plan:

1. Player moves from pos25 to pos55 (satisfying constraint 1).
2. Player moves to pos44.
3. Player moves to pos24 (satisfying constraint 4).
4. Move the stone to pos11 (to satisfy constraint 5).
5. Move the player to pos23 (satisfying constraints 2 and 3).
6. Push the stone to pos12 (the goal).

Let's trace through this action by action:

Player (P) starts at pos25, Stone (S) at pos32, Goal (G) at pos12.

```
    1 2 3 4 5
  -------------
1 | _ _ _ _ _
2 | G _ S _ _
3 | _ _ _ _ _
4 | _ _ _ _ _
5 | _ P _ _ _
```

1. move player1 pos25 pos35 dirright
2. move player1 pos35 pos45 dirright
3. move player1 pos45 pos55 dirright (satisfying constraint 1)
4. move player1 pos55 pos54 dirup
5. move player1 pos54 pos44 dirup
6. move player1 pos44 pos34 dirleft
7. move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft (satisfying constraint 4)
8. Now let's move to position the player to push the stone to pos11.
   move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup
9. move player1 pos23 pos33 dirright
10. move player1 pos33 pos43 dirright
11. move player1 pos43 pos42 dirup
12. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos22 dirleft
13. move player1 pos32 pos22 dirleft
14. move player1 pos22 pos21 dirup
15. move player1 pos21 pos31 dirright
16. move player1 pos31 pos41 dirright
17. move player1 pos41 pos42 dirdown
18. move player1 pos42 pos32 dirleft
19. move player1 pos32 pos31 dirup
20. move player1 pos31 pos21 dirleft
21. move player1 pos21 pos11 dirleft
22. move player1 pos11 pos12 dirdown
23. move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown
24. move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown
25. move player1 pos14 pos24 dirright
26. move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright
27. move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup
28. move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft
29. move player1 pos23 pos22 dirup
30. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos12 pos11 dirleft (satisfying constraint 5)
31. move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown
32. move player1 pos13 pos23 dirright
33. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos11 pos12 dirdown (completing the task)

Well, that's a very long plan. Let me check it for mistakes or simplifications, and also recheck that all constraints would be satisfied:

1. The player was at pos55 at some point, satisfying constraint 1.
2. The player was at pos23 multiple times, satisfying constraint 2.
3. Before the player was at pos23, it was at pos44, satisfying constraint 3.
4. The player was at pos24 multiple times, satisfying constraint 4.
5. After the player was at pos24, the stone was at pos11, satisfying constraint 5.

All constraints appear to be satisfied, but I'll double-check my plan to make sure it's correct and see if there are any simplifications I can make.

Alright, I think I made it overly complicated. Let's retry a simpler plan:

1. Player moves from pos25 to pos55 (satisfying constraint 1).
2. Player moves to pos44.
3. Player moves to pos24 (satisfying constraint 4).
4. Player moves to pos23 (satisfying constraints 2 and 3).
5. Position the player to push the stone (at pos32) to pos22.
6. Push the stone from pos32 to pos22.
7. Position the player to push the stone from pos22 to pos11.
8. Push the stone from pos22 to pos11 (satisfying constraint 5).
9. Position the player to push the stone from pos11 to pos12.
10. Push the stone from pos11 to pos12 (the goal).

Let me trace through this action by action:

Player (P) starts at pos25, Stone (S) at pos32, Goal (G) at pos12.

22. move player1 pos21 pos22 dirdown
23. move player1 pos22 pos12 dirleft
24. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos12 pos11 pos12 dirright (completing the task)

Hmm, let's make sure this approach is correct and coherent...

Actually, let me recheck my sequence of actions on step 18 because I'm getting confused. After step 17, the stone is at pos22 and the player is at pos12. Here, I want to push the stone from pos22 to pos21. For that, I need the player to be at pos23 to align with the direction.

13. move player1 pos32 pos22 dirleft
```

3 | _ _ _ _ _

5 | _ _ _ _ _
```

Oh, I see the problem. My understanding of the layout was wrong. Let me recap:

Position posXY means row X, column Y. The stone is at pos32 (row 3, column 2), the player is at pos25 (row 2, column 5), and the goal is at pos12 (row 1, column 2).

No, wait, pos32 is (3,2) which means the stone is at row 3, column 2. Let me review all the adjacencies to make sure.

"You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright" - this means from the position at row 1, column 1, you can move to the position at row 2, column 1 by moving right. But that doesn't align with standard conventions; moving right would be (1,1) to (1,2).

Let me think... dirright increases the first number (from 1 to 2), and dirdown increases the second number (from 1 to 2). This suggests that the first number (X in posXY) represents the column, and the second number (Y) represents the row. But that's also not standard.

Wait, it's not consistently that way. Let's see:

"You may move from location pos11 to location pos12 following direction dirdown" - moving down increases the second number.

"You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright" - moving right increases the first number.

This is confusing. Let me reconsider using the adjacency relationships to get a clearer picture. Let me check the first few:

"You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright"
"You may move from location pos11 to location pos12 following direction dirdown"

Assuming a standard 2D grid where moving right increases the column and moving down increases the row, these adjacencies would make sense if posXY meant column X, row Y. This would be non-standard, but it's consistent.

Let's try to visualize it this way:

```
    Y=1  Y=2  Y=3  Y=4  Y=5
    ------------------
X=1 |pos11 pos12 pos13 pos14 pos15
X=2 |pos21 pos22 pos23 pos24 pos25
X=3 |pos31 pos32 pos33 pos34 pos35
X=4 |pos41 pos42 pos43 pos44 pos45
X=5 |pos51 pos52 pos53 pos54 pos55
```

With this interpretation:
- "player1 is at location pos25" means the player is at (2,5), or column 2, row 5 (bottom left area).
- "stone1 is at location pos32" means the stone is at (3,2), or column 3, row 2 (upper right area).
- "pos12 is a goal location" means (1,2), or column 1, row 2, is a goal.

Let's adjust our visualization:

```
        Y=1  Y=2  Y=3  Y=4  Y=5

So, to push the stone to the goal, we need to push it from pos32 to pos12, which means from column 3, row 2 to column 1, row 2.
That's pushing the stone to the left.

Let's trace our plan again with this understanding:

Player (P) is at pos25 (column 2, row 5), Stone (S) is at pos32 (column 3, row 2), Goal (G) is at pos12 (column 1, row 2).

1. Move the player to pos55 (to satisfy constraint 1).
2. Position the player to get to pos44 (for constraints 3).
3. Position the player to get to pos24 (for constraint 4).
4. Position the player to get to pos23 (for constraint 2).
5. Position the player to push the stone from pos32 to pos22, then to pos12.
6. Push the stone to pos11 (to satisfy constraint 5), then to pos12.

Let's map out the sequence of actions:

1. move player1 pos25 pos35 dirright
2. move player1 pos35 pos45 dirright
3. move player1 pos45 pos55 dirright (satisfying constraint 1)
4. move player1 pos55 pos45 dirleft
5. move player1 pos45 pos44 dirup
6. move player1 pos44 pos34 dirleft
7. move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft (satisfying constraint 4)

Now, the player is at pos24. According to constraint 5, after the player is at pos24, either pos45 should not be clear or the stone should be at pos11. Since pos45 is clear, we need to ensure the stone gets to pos11 at some point.

8. move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup (satisfying constraints 2 and 3)
9. move player1 pos23 pos33 dirright
10. move player1 pos33 pos32 dirup

Wait, pos32 has the stone, so we can't move there directly. We need to approach from the opposite side to push.

9. move player1 pos23 pos33 dirright
10. move player1 pos33 pos43 dirright
11. move player1 pos43 pos42 dirup
12. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos22 dirleft

Now, the stone is at pos22 and the player is at pos32. To get the stone to pos11, let's move the stone to pos21 and then to pos11.

13. move player1 pos32 pos31 dirup
14. move player1 pos31 pos21 dirleft
15. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos21 pos22 pos21 dirleft

The stone is at pos21 and the player is at pos22. Now, to push the stone to pos11:

16. move player1 pos22 pos12 dirleft
17. move player1 pos12 pos11 dirup
18. move player1 pos11 pos21 dirdown
19. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos21 pos21 pos11 dirup (satisfying constraint 5)

The stone is at pos11 and the player is at pos21. Now, to push the stone to the goal at pos12:

20. move player1 pos21 pos22 dirright
21. move player1 pos22 pos12 dirleft
22. move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown
23. move player1 pos13 pos23 dirright
24. move player1 pos23 pos22 dirup
25. move player1 pos22 pos21 dirleft
26. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos21 pos11 pos12 dirdown (completing the task)

Let's double-check this plan for any errors or issues.

I'm now in doubt if some of my actions are correctly formulated. 

One doubt: In steps 15 and 19, I'm pushing the stone from and to the same location (pos22 to pos21 and pos21 to pos11), which doesn't align with how I formulated "dirleft" and "dirup". These directions should align with the grid. So, I think I formulated some of these incorrectly.

Let's start again:

Player (P) is at pos25 (column 2, row 5), Stone (S) is at pos32 (column 3, row 2), Goal (G) is at pos12 (column 1, row 2).

1. move player1 pos25 pos35 dirright
2. move player1 pos35 pos45 dirright
3. move player1 pos45 pos55 dirright (satisfying constraint 1)
4. move player1 pos55 pos45 dirleft
5. move player1 pos45 pos44 dirup
6. move player1 pos44 pos34 dirleft
7. move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft (satisfying constraint 4)
8. move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup (satisfying constraints 2 and 3)
9. move player1 pos23 pos33 dirright
10. move player1 pos33 pos43 dirright
11. move player1 pos43 pos42 dirup

The player is now at pos42, and the stone is at pos32. I can push the stone from pos32 to pos22 (towards the direction dirleft).

12. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos22 dirleft

Now, the stone is at pos22 and the player is at pos32. Let's position the player to push the stone from pos22 to pos12.

13. move player1 pos32 pos33 dirdown
14. move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft
15. move player1 pos23 pos13 dirleft
16. move player1 pos13 pos12 dirup

The player is now at pos12 and the stone is at pos22. Constraint 5 says that after the player is at pos24, either pos45 is not clear or the stone is at pos11. Since we've had the player at pos24 (step 7), we need to ensure that the stone gets to pos11 at some point. 

Actually, let's trace the action differently:

12. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos22 dirleft

Now, the stone is at pos22 and the player is at pos32. Let's push the stone to pos11 to satisfy constraint 5.

13. move player1 pos32 pos31 dirup
14. move player1 pos31 pos21 dirleft

The player is now at pos21, next to the stone at pos22. To push the stone from pos22 to pos21, the player should approach pos22 from the opposite direction of the push. This would be from pos23. I made a mistake.

Let's revise from steps 12-13:

12. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos22 dirleft
13. move player1 pos32 pos33 dirdown
14. move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft

The player is now at pos23 and the stone is at pos22. I can push the stone from pos22 to pos21.

15. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos22 pos21 dirleft

The stone is now at pos21 and the player is at pos22. Let's now push the stone to pos11.

16. move player1 pos22 pos12 dirleft
17. move player1 pos12 pos11 dirup
18. move player1 pos11 pos21 dirdown (down from the stone)

The player is now at pos21 and the stone is at pos11 (satisfying constraint 5). Let's position the player to push the stone to the goal.

19. move player1 pos21 pos11 dirleft

Wait, pos11 and pos21 are not adjacent going left. According to the given adjacencies, moving left would be from pos21 to pos11. I've been confusing myself.

Let me reconsider the layout:

Given that we can move from pos11 to pos21 following dirright and from pos11 to pos12 following dirdown, I'll represent it as follows:

```
       pos11 --- dirright ---> pos21
        |
        | dirdown
        |
        v
       pos12
```

This works if posXY is row X, column Y and the grid is indexed from the top-left (standard in most programming contexts).

Another approach: In a standard grid, moving right increases the X-coordinate, and moving down increases the Y-coordinate. Given that moving right in our context goes from pos11 to pos21, it suggests that the first digit (X in posXY) corresponds to the column.

Ok, let me try once more:

In a standard grid:
- Moving right increases the X-coordinate.
- Moving down increases the Y-coordinate.

In our context:
- dirright goes from pos11 to pos21 (increases the first digit).
- dirdown goes from pos11 to pos12 (increases the second digit).

This aligns if posXY means X is the column and Y is the row. So, pos32 is at column 3, row 2. The stone is at column 3, row 2, and the goal is at column 1, row 2.

Actually, the adjacency data is quite comprehensive, so let me go through that to get a clearer picture:

"You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright" - Moving right increases the first digit.
"You may move from location pos11 to location pos12 following direction dirdown" - Moving down increases the second digit.
"You may move from location pos12 to location pos22 following direction dirright" - Moving right increases the first digit.
"You may move from location pos12 to location pos11 following direction dirup" - Moving up decreases the second digit.

This is all consistent with posXY where X is the column, Y is the row, and dirright increases the column, dirdown increases the row, dirleft decreases the column, and dirup decreases the row.

I think I don't need to visualize the entire grid again. Let's go with this interpretation and revise our plan.

Player (P) is at pos25 (column 2, row 5), Stone (S) is at pos32 (column 3, row 2), Goal (G) is at pos12 (column 1, row 2).

1. move player1 pos25 pos35 dirright
2. move player1 pos35 pos45 dirright
3. move player1 pos45 pos55 dirright (satisfying constraint 1)
4. move player1 pos55 pos45 dirleft
5. move player1 pos45 pos44 dirup
6. move player1 pos44 pos34 dirleft
7. move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft (satisfying constraint 4)
8. move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup (satisfying constraints 2 and 3)
9. move player1 pos23 pos33 dirright
10. move player1 pos33 pos43 dirright
11. move player1 pos43 pos42 dirup
12. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos22 dirleft

Now, the stone is at pos22 and the player is at pos32. I want to push the stone to pos11 to satisfy constraint 5. Since the stone is now at pos22, to push it to pos21, the player should be at pos23.

13. move player1 pos32 pos33 dirdown
14. move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft
15. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos22 pos21 dirleft

Now, the stone is at pos21 and the player is at pos22. To push the stone to pos11, the player should be at pos31.

16. move player1 pos22 pos32 dirright
17. move player1 pos32 pos31 dirup
18. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos21 pos11 dirleft (satisfying constraint 5)

Now, the stone is at pos11 and the player is at pos21. To push the stone to the goal at pos12, the player should be at pos11.

19. move player1 pos21 pos11 dirleft
20. move player1 pos11 pos12 dirdown
21. move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown
22. move player1 pos13 pos23 dirright
23. move player1 pos23 pos22 dirup
24. move player1 pos22 pos21 dirleft
25. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos21 pos11 pos12 dirdown (to the goal)

Actually, step 25 is not a pushtonongoal because pos12 is a goal location.
let's see that action: "pushtonongoal p s l_p l_from l_to d"

I think it should be:
25. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos21 pos11 pos12 dirdown (to the goal)

Now, the stone is at a goal location (pos12), which is our task. I've also made sure that all constraints are satisfied. 

Let's review the entire plan to ensure it's correct:
- Player starts at pos25, stone at pos32, and goal at pos12.
- Player visits pos55 (constraint 1).
- Player visits pos44 (prerequisite for constraint 3).
- Player visits pos24 (constraint 4).
- Player visits pos23 (constraint 2) after visiting pos44 (satisfying constraint 3).
- After the player is at pos24, the stone is moved to pos11 (satisfying constraint 5).
- Finally, the stone is pushed to the goal at pos12.

I think this plan is correct and satisfies all constraints. Let's formalize it.

1. move player1 pos25 pos35 dirright
2. move player1 pos35 pos45 dirright
3. move player1 pos45 pos55 dirright
4. move player1 pos55 pos45 dirleft
5. move player1 pos45 pos44 dirup
6. move player1 pos44 pos34 dirleft
7. move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft
8. move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup
9. move player1 pos23 pos33 dirright
10. move player1 pos33 pos43 dirright
11. move player1 pos43 pos42 dirup
12. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos22 dirleft
13. move player1 pos32 pos33 dirdown
14. move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft
15. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos22 pos21 dirleft
16. move player1 pos22 pos32 dirright
17. move player1 pos32 pos31 dirup
18. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos21 pos11 dirleft
19. move player1 pos21 pos11 dirleft
20. move player1 pos11 pos12 dirdown
21. move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown
22. move player1 pos13 pos23 dirright
23. move player1 pos23 pos22 dirup
24. move player1 pos22 pos21 dirleft
25. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos21 pos11 pos12 dirdown

But there's a problem. In step 19, the player moves to pos11 where the stone already is. This isn't allowed because the location should be clear. I think I'm making a mistake in my understanding or planning.

Let's try again, with careful attention to each step. Starting from step 18:

18. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos21 pos11 dirleft

Now, the stone is at pos11 and the player is at pos21. I need to push the stone from pos11 to pos12. This requires the player to be at pos10, but that position doesn't exist. Let's think differently.

I can backtrack. After step 17, the player is at pos31 and the stone is at pos21. Instead of pushing the stone to pos11, let's try to take a different approach:

18. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos21 pos11 dirleft

After this step, the stone is at pos11 and the player is at pos21. At this point, instead of trying to push the stone from pos11, let's try to pull it. We'll move the player around to get to a position from which we can push the stone from pos11 to pos12.

19. move player1 pos21 pos22 dirdown (down)
20. move player1 pos22 pos23 dirdown (down)
21. move player1 pos23 pos13 dirleft (left)
22. move player1 pos13 pos12 dirup (up)
23. move player1 pos12 pos11 dirup (up)
24. move player1 pos11 pos21 dirdown (down)
25. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos21 pos11 pos12 dirdown (to the goal)

Oh wait, I made the same mistake. After step 18, the stone is at pos11. Then in step 23, I'm trying to move the player to pos11, but that position is occupied by the stone.

Let me revisit the plan. After step 17, the player is at pos31 and the stone is at pos21. Maybe I can position the player to push the stone from pos21 to pos11 and then from pos11 to pos12 in a continuous flow.

18. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos21 pos11 dirleft

Now, the stone is at pos11 and the player is at pos21. I need to push the stone from pos11 to pos12. This is tricky because the player is at pos21 and the stone is at pos11. The stone is now at pos11, and I want to push it to pos12, which would require the player to be at pos10 (which doesn't exist).

Actually, let's reorient our approach: After step 17, the player is at pos31 and the stone is at pos21. Instead of pushing the stone to pos11, let's push it to pos22, and then to pos12. This way, we can avoid the issue of pushing from pos11.

From step 17:
17. move player1 pos32 pos31 dirup 

The player is at pos31 and the stone is at pos21. Let's push the stone from pos21 to pos22 (down).

18. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos21 pos22 dirdown

Now, the stone is at pos22 and the player is at pos21. Let's position the player to push the stone from pos22 to pos12.

19. move player1 pos21 pos31 dirright
20. move player1 pos31 pos32 dirdown
21. move player1 pos32 pos33 dirdown
22. move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft
23. move player1 pos23 pos13 dirleft
24. move player1 pos13 pos12 dirup
25. move player1 pos12 pos22 dirdown
26. move player1 pos22 pos32 dirright
27. move player1 pos32 pos31 dirup
28. move player1 pos31 pos21 dirleft
29. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos21 pos22 pos12 dirleft

Wait, step 25 has the player moving to pos22, but the stone is at pos22. I'm making a mistake.

Let's try yet another approach. After step 18, the stone is at pos22 and the player is at pos21. To push the stone from pos22 to pos12, the player needs to be at pos32. Let's adjust our plan:

19. move player1 pos21 pos31 dirright
20. move player1 pos31 pos32 dirdown
21. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos22 pos12 dirleft

I believe this plan is correct. Now let's make sure our constraints are satisfied:

- Player visits pos55 (constraint 1) in step 3.
- Player visits pos44 (prerequisite for constraint 3) in step 5.
- Player visits pos24 (constraint 4) in step 7.
- Player visits pos23 (constraint 2) in step 8, after visiting pos44 (satisfying constraint 3).
- After the player is at pos24, the stone is at pos22, pos12 but not at pos11. pos45 is also clear. This doesn't satisfy constraint 5.

We still have a problem with constraint 5: After the player is at pos24, either pos45 should not be clear or the stone should be at pos11. We need to adjust our plan.

After step 7, the player is at pos24. Constraint 5 asks that after this state, either pos45 is not clear or the stone is at pos11.

One way to make pos45 not clear is to move the player to pos45. Let's adjust our plan. From step 7:

7. move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft (player is at pos24)
8. move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright
9. move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright
10. move player1 pos44 pos45 dirdown (now pos45 is not clear, satisfying constraint 5)
11. move player1 pos45 pos44 dirup
12. move player1 pos44 pos34 dirleft
13. move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft
14. move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup (satisfying constraint 2 and 3)
15. move player1 pos23 pos33 dirright
16. move player1 pos33 pos43 dirright
17. move player1 pos43 pos42 dirup
18. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos22 dirleft
19. move player1 pos32 pos22 dirleft
20. move player1 pos22 pos12 dirleft
21. move player1 pos12 pos22 dirright
22. move player1 pos22 pos32 dirright
23. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos22 pos12 dirleft

Wait, step 19 has the player moving to pos22, but the stone is already at pos22 after the push in step 18. I need to be more careful.

After step 18, the stone is at pos22 and the player is at pos32. To push the stone from pos22 to pos12, we need the player to be at pos32, which it already is. So:

19. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos22 pos12 dirleft

Now, the stone is at the goal (pos12) and the player is at pos22. The task is completed, and all constraints are satisfied.

Let's finalize the entire plan:

1. move player1 pos25 pos35 dirright
2. move player1 pos35 pos45 dirright
3. move player1 pos45 pos55 dirright (player at pos55, constraint 1 satisfied)
4. move player1 pos55 pos45 dirleft
5. move player1 pos45 pos44 dirup (player at pos44)
6. move player1 pos44 pos34 dirleft
7. move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft (player at pos24, constraint 4 satisfied)
8. move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright
9. move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright
10. move player1 pos44 pos45 dirdown (pos45 not clear, constraint 5 satisfied)
11. move player1 pos45 pos44 dirup
12. move player1 pos44 pos34 dirleft
13. move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft
14. move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup (player at pos23 after being at pos44, constraints 2 and 3 satisfied)
15. move player1 pos23 pos33 dirright
16. move player1 pos33 pos43 dirright
17. move player1 pos43 pos42 dirup
18. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos22 dirleft
19. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos22 pos12 dirleft (stone at goal, task completed)

Wait, let me check if this is optimal. 19 steps seems like quite a lot. Let me try to optimize further.

From the start, the player (P) is at pos25, the stone (S) is at pos32, and the goal (G) is at pos12. We need to satisfy some constraints along the way.

1. move player1 pos25 pos35 dirright
2. move player1 pos35 pos45 dirright
3. move player1 pos45 pos55 dirright (player at pos55, constraint 1 satisfied)
4. move player1 pos55 pos45 dirleft
5. move player1 pos45 pos44 dirup (player at pos44)
6. move player1 pos44 pos34 dirleft
7. move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft (player at pos24, constraint 4 satisfied)
8. move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright
9. move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright
10. move player1 pos44 pos45 dirdown (pos45 not clear, constraint 5 satisfied)

When the player is at pos45, there's a shorter path to get to the stone. Let's adjust:

10. move player1 pos44 pos45 dirdown (pos45 not clear, constraint 5 satisfied)
11. move player1 pos45 pos35 dirleft
12. move player1 pos35 pos25 dirleft
13. move player1 pos25 pos24 dirup
14. move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup (player at pos23, constraints 2 and 3 satisfied)
15. move player1 pos23 pos33 dirright
16. move player1 pos33 pos32 dirup (player positioned to push stone)
17. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos32 pos22 dirleft
18. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos22 pos12 dirleft (stone at goal, task completed)

This is 18 steps, which is slightly better. But I think I'm making an error in steps 17 and 18. Let me redo the formulation of those steps:

We're using: pushtonongoal p s l_p l_from l_to d

After step 16, the player is at pos32 and wants to push the stone, also at pos32, to pos22. This doesn't make sense, because both the player and the stone can't occupy the same position. Let me recheck the initial state.

The initial state says "stone1 is at location pos32". Given our interpretation that posXY means column X, row Y, the stone is at column 3, row 2. The player starts at pos25, which is column 2, row 5.

Alright, I think I've been on the right track. Here's the corrected plan:

1. move player1 pos25 pos35 dirright
2. move player1 pos35 pos45 dirright
3. move player1 pos45 pos55 dirright (player at pos55, constraint 1 satisfied)
4. move player1 pos55 pos45 dirleft
5. move player1 pos45 pos44 dirup (player at pos44)
6. move player1 pos44 pos34 dirleft
7. move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft (player at pos24, constraint 4 satisfied)
8. move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright
9. move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright
10. move player1 pos44 pos45 dirdown (pos45 not clear, constraint 5 satisfied)
11. move player1 pos45 pos35 dirleft
12. move player1 pos35 pos25 dirleft
13. move player1 pos25 pos24 dirup
14. move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup (player at pos23, constraints 2 and 3 satisfied)
15. move player1 pos23 pos33 dirright
16. move player1 pos33 pos43 dirright
17. move player1 pos43 pos42 dirup
18. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos22 dirleft (player pushes stone from pos32 to pos22)
19. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos22 pos12 dirleft (player pushes stone from pos22 to pos12, completing the task)

I believe this is the correct plan, satisfying all constraints and achieving the goal. I've double-checked and it seems optimal for the given constraints.
