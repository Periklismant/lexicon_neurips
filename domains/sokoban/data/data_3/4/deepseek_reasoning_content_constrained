Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. Hmm, the goal is to get stone1 to a goal location, which in this case is pos12. Wait, looking back at the initial state, pos12 is the only goal location mentioned. All other locations are not goals. So stone1 starts at pos32. I need to move it to pos12.

First, I need to figure out how the agent (player1) can get to stone1 and then push it. The agent starts at pos25. Let me visualize the grid. Positions are like posXY where X is row and Y is column? Maybe. So pos25 is row 2, column5. Stone1 is at pos32 (row3, column2). The goal is pos12 (row1, column2).

The movement directions are up, down, left, right. Let me check the allowed moves. From pos25, the possible moves are to pos15 (left), pos35 (right), or pos24 (up). Wait, the "You may move from location pos25 to location pos24 following direction dirup". So dirup would move from pos25 to pos24. Similarly, moving right from pos25 goes to pos35. 

So the agent needs to navigate from pos25 to pos32. Let's see the path. From pos25, moving up to pos24. Then from pos24, maybe left to pos14? Wait, no. Let me check the allowed moves for each position.

Looking at the moves:

Starting at pos25:
- dirleft to pos15
- dirright to pos35
- dirup to pos24

From pos24, possible moves are dirleft to pos14, dirright to pos34, dirup to pos23, dirdown to pos25. Wait, the description says "You may move from location pos24 to location pos14 following direction dirleft". So moving left from pos24 would go to pos14. But pos14 is in a different row. Maybe the grid is such that each row is horizontal? Maybe I'm misunderstanding the layout. Let me try to map the positions.

Alternatively, perhaps the positions are arranged in a 5x5 grid where the first digit is the row (1-5) and the second is the column (1-5). So pos11 is top-left, pos15 is top-right, pos51 is bottom-left, pos55 is bottom-right.

So moving directions:

- dirup and dirdown probably correspond to moving north and south (changing the row), while dirleft and dirright are east and west (changing the column). Wait, but the move from pos11 to pos12 is dirdown. Wait, that's confusing. Let me check the movement directions again.

Wait, the movement from pos11 to pos12 is dirdown. So if pos11 is (1,1), then dirdown would take you to pos12 (1,2)? Wait, that can't be. Because pos12 is row1, column2. So moving down from pos11 (row1, column1) to pos12 would be moving right (east). But according to the problem's movement definitions, "You may move from location pos11 to location pos12 following direction dirdown". So direction dirdown from pos11 leads to pos12, which is east. That suggests that directions are perhaps not the usual cardinal directions. Maybe the directions are a bit different. Let's clarify:

Looking at the allowed moves:

For example, from pos11, you can move right to pos21 (dirright) or down to pos12 (dirdown). So in this grid, dirright moves to the next row? Wait, pos11 to pos21 is dirright. So row increases by 1 when moving right. Then pos21 is row2, column1. Then moving dirright from pos21 would go to pos31. So dirright increases the row, while dirdown increases the column. Hmm, that's a bit unconventional. So the grid is structured such that moving right (dirright) increases the row number, and moving down (dirdown) increases the column number. So pos11 is (1,1), dirright takes you to (2,1), dirdown takes you to (1,2). Similarly, dirleft would decrease the row, dirup decrease the column.

This is a bit confusing, but maybe that's how it's set up. So the grid is arranged with rows as the first number and columns as the second. So moving dirright from pos11 (row1, column1) takes you to pos21 (row2, column1), which is directly below in a traditional grid. But in this case, the movement is such that dirright is south, dirleft is north, dirdown is east, dirup is west. Or maybe I have that mixed up. Let's try to see:

If pos11 can move dirright to pos21, that's row2, column1. So dirright is moving down a row. Then, moving dirdown from pos11 takes you to pos12 (row1, column2), which is to the right. So in this grid, dirright is moving down (row increases), dirleft is moving up (row decreases), dirdown is moving right (column increases), dirup is moving left (column decreases). That seems to be the case.

So to move from pos25 (row2, column5) to pos32 (row3, column2), the agent needs to navigate through the grid. Let's think of the positions as (row, column):

pos25: (2,5)
stone1 is at pos32: (3,2)
goal is pos12: (1,2)

The agent needs to push stone1 from (3,2) to (1,2). But how? Because the agent can only push stones in a direction if the agent is adjacent to the stone and the next cell is clear.

First, the agent needs to reach pos32. Let's plan a path from pos25 to pos32.

Current position: pos25 (2,5)

Possible moves from pos25: move dirleft to pos15 (1,5), dirright to pos35 (3,5), dirup to pos24 (2,4). Let's see which path leads to pos32.

Alternatively, moving from pos25 to pos24 (dirup) to pos24 (2,4). From pos24, possible moves: dirleft to pos14 (1,4), dirright to pos34 (3,4), dirup to pos23 (2,3). Let's aim to get to row3, column2.

Hmm, maybe the path is pos25 -> pos24 (dirup) -> pos23 (dirup) -> pos22 (dirup) -> pos32 via dirright? Wait, pos23 is (2,3). From pos23, moving dirright would go to pos33 (3,3). Not helpful. Or from pos22 (2,2), moving dirright to pos32 (3,2). But how to get to pos22.

Wait, let's see. From pos25, the agent can move dirright to pos35 (3,5). Then from pos35, dirleft to pos25? No. Alternatively, pos35 can move dirup to pos34 (3,4). Then dirleft to pos33 (3,3), then dirleft to pos32 (3,2). But that's a possible path. Let's check the allowed moves:

From pos25 (2,5) move dirright to pos35 (3,5). Then from pos35, can we move dirup? Looking at the allowed moves for pos35: "You may move from location pos35 to location pos25 following direction dirleft", "You may move from location pos35 to location pos45 following direction dirright", "You may move from location pos35 to location pos34 following direction dirup". So dirup from pos35 goes to pos34 (3,4). Then from pos34, moving dirup (which would decrease the column) to pos33 (3,3). Wait, no. Let's check pos34's allowed moves. From pos34, directions include dirleft to pos24 (row2, column4?), no. Wait, the movement from pos34 to pos24 is dirleft. So dirleft from pos34 (3,4) would go to pos24 (2,4). That's moving up a row. Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe a better approach is to find the shortest path from pos25 to pos32.

Alternatively, perhaps a better path is to go from pos25 -> pos24 (dirup) -> pos23 (dirup) -> pos22 (dirup) -> pos32 via dirright. Let's see:

pos25 (2,5) dirup to pos24 (2,4). Then from pos24, dirup to pos23 (2,3). Then dirup to pos22 (2,2). From pos22, dirright to pos32 (3,2). Is that possible? Let me check the allowed moves:

From pos22, the allowed moves include dirright to pos32 (Yes: "You may move from location pos22 to location pos32 following direction dirright"). So yes. So that path would work. So the steps would be:

move player1 pos25 pos24 dirup

move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup

move player1 pos23 pos22 dirup

move player1 pos22 pos32 dirright

But wait, when moving to pos32, is pos32 clear? Initially, stone1 is at pos32, so it's not clear. So the agent can't move there. Oh right! So that's a problem. The initial state says stone1 is at pos32, and pos32 is clear? Wait, looking back: "stone1 is at location pos32" and "Location pos32 is clear". Wait, that can't be. If a stone is at a location, then the location is not clear. But according to the initial state:

"Location pos32 is clear" but also "stone1 is at location pos32". That's a contradiction. Wait, the user must have made a mistake here. Let me check the original state again.

Looking at the original state:

The user wrote:

"Location pos25 is clear"

"Location pos32 is clear"

But also:

"stone1 is at location pos32"

So that's a conflict. Because if a stone is at pos32, then pos32 should not be clear. So this must be an error in the problem statement. But assuming that the user provided the correct initial state, perhaps there's a mistake here, but we have to work with it. Alternatively, maybe "clear" refers to the presence of the agent. Because stones and agent can't be in the same location. So if a stone is at pos32, then the agent can't be there, but the location is not clear (since the stone is there). But according to the initial state, pos32 is clear. This is a problem. Maybe the user made a mistake. But given that the initial state says stone1 is at pos32 and pos32 is clear, that's conflicting. However, since the problem states that the initial state is as given, we need to proceed, but perhaps there's an error here. However, given that, when planning, we have to consider that pos32 is clear (no agent there) but stone1 is there. But that's impossible. So perhaps the correct initial state is that pos32 is not clear because the stone is there. Maybe the user made a typo and pos32 is not clear. Let me recheck the original state.

Looking back:

In the original state:

"Location pos11 is clear"

...

"Location pos31 is clear"

"Location pos33 is clear"

"Location pos34 is clear"

"Location pos35 is clear"

"Location pos32 is clear"

So the user says pos32 is clear, but stone1 is at pos32. That's a contradiction. Therefore, this must be an error. But since the problem is given, perhaps the stone is at pos32, making pos32 not clear. So maybe there's a typo in the original state. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed this way, but that's impossible. So this is a problem. But as the assistant, I have to proceed with the given information. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps "clear" means that there is no stone or agent. But the presence of a stone would make the location not clear. So in that case, the initial state is inconsistent. However, given that the problem states that the agent is at pos25 and stone1 is at pos32, then pos32 is not clear. But the user's original state says pos32 is clear. So this is a problem. Therefore, perhaps it's a mistake in the problem statement, and pos32 is not clear. But since I can't change the problem, I have to proceed as if pos32 is clear (which is impossible with the stone there). So perhaps this is a mistake, but the correct initial state should have pos32 not clear. Maybe the user intended that the stone is at pos32 and pos32 is not clear, but in the initial state, they forgot to remove "Location pos32 is clear". So in that case, the stone is at pos32, so pos32 is not clear. Therefore, the agent cannot move into pos32 unless pushing the stone. So the initial plan to move the agent to pos32 is impossible. So the agent must push the stone from pos32 to another location.

Wait, the stone is at pos32. The agent needs to push it. So the agent needs to get adjacent to pos32 in order to push the stone. For example, if the agent is at pos22, then they can push the stone north (dirup) to pos12? Or in the direction towards pos12. Wait, but pos12 is a goal location. So to push the stone to a goal location, the agent needs to use the pushtogoal action.

But first, how to reach the stone. The stone is at pos32. The agent is at pos25. So the agent needs to navigate to a position adjacent to pos32 to push it. The adjacent positions to pos32 (3,2) are pos22 (2,2) to the north (dirleft?), pos31 (3,1) to the west (dirup?), pos33 (3,3) to the east (dirdown?), and pos42 (4,2) to the south (dirright?).

Wait, based on the movement directions:

From pos32, the allowed moves are:

- dirleft to pos22 (row2, column2)
- dirright to pos42 (row4, column2)
- dirup to pos31 (row3, column1)
- dirdown to pos33 (row3, column3)

Wait, according to the problem's movement definitions:

"You may move from location pos32 to location pos22 following direction dirleft"

"You may move from location pos32 to location pos42 following direction dirright"

"You may move from location pos32 to location pos31 following direction dirup"

"You may move from location pos32 to location pos33 following direction dirdown"

So, to push the stone at pos32, the agent needs to be in one of the adjacent positions (pos22, pos31, pos33, pos42) and then push the stone in a direction towards a goal.

But the only goal is pos12. So the agent needs to push the stone from pos32 to pos22, then to pos12. Because pos12 is the goal.

So the plan would be:

1. Move agent from pos25 to pos22 (adjacent to stone at pos32)
2. Push the stone from pos32 to pos22 (but pos22 is not a goal, so use pushtonongoal)
Wait, but pos22 is not a goal. Then from pos22, push it to pos12 (which is a goal). So:

But the agent needs to push the stone from pos32 to pos22 (non-goal), then from pos22 to pos12 (goal). However, pushing from pos32 to pos22 requires the agent to be at pos32's adjacent position. Let's think:

First, the agent must reach pos22. From pos25, the path could be:

pos25 → pos24 (dirup)
pos24 → pos23 (dirup)
pos23 → pos22 (dirup)

Once at pos22, the agent can push the stone from pos32 (which is south of pos22) to pos22. Wait, but pos32 is south of pos22? Because pos22 is row2, column2. pos32 is row3, column2. So pos32 is directly south (dirright direction) of pos22. So to push the stone from pos32 to pos22, the agent would have to be at pos32 and push north (dirleft), but that's not possible. Wait, the agent can only push the stone if the agent is adjacent in the direction of the push. For example, to push the stone from pos32 to pos22 (north), the agent must be at pos32 and push it north. But the agent can't be at pos32 because the stone is there. Wait, no. The agent can't be at the same location as the stone. So to push the stone from pos32 to pos22, the agent must be at pos32's adjacent location in the direction opposite to the push. Wait, the preconditions for pushtogoal and pushtonongoal are:

For "pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d", the agent is at l_p, which is adjacent to l_from (the stone's current position), and the direction d allows moving from l_p to l_from (so agent is adjacent in direction d). Then, the stone is pushed from l_from to l_to in direction d. So for example, if the agent is at pos22, and the stone is at pos32, and the direction is dirright (from pos22 to pos32 is dirright?), then pushing the stone from pos32 (l_from) to pos42 (l_to) in direction dirright. But we want to push the stone north to pos22. Wait, no. Let me think again.

The agent's location (l_p) must be adjacent to the stone's location (l_from) such that you can move from l_p to l_from following direction d. So for example, if the agent is at pos22, and the stone is at pos32, and the direction is dirright (since moving from pos22 to pos32 is dirright), then the agent can push the stone in direction d (dirright) from l_from (pos32) to l_to (pos42). But we want to push the stone north to pos22. So the agent would need to be south of the stone, pushing it north. But the stone is at pos32. To push it north (to pos22), the agent needs to be south of the stone (pos42) and push it north (dirleft). Wait, this is getting confusing. Let's clarify:

To push the stone from pos32 to pos22 (north), the direction would be dirleft (since from pos32 to pos22 is dirleft). The agent needs to be in a position adjacent to pos32 in the direction opposite to the push. Wait, the direction for the push is the direction from l_from to l_to. So if the stone is moving from pos32 to pos22 (dirleft), then the agent must be at pos32's dirright (pos42) and push in dirleft? No. Wait, the direction d in the action is the direction from l_p to l_from, and from l_from to l_to. So the agent is at l_p, moves in direction d to l_from (the stone's location), and then the stone moves in direction d to l_to.

Wait, the action's preconditions for pushtogoal are:

(iv) you can get from l_p to l_from following direction d.

(v) you can get from l_from to l_to following direction d.

So the direction d is the same for both. So if the agent is at l_p (e.g., pos22), and l_from is pos32, then direction d must allow moving from pos22 to pos32 (dirright). Then, the stone is pushed from pos32 to l_to, which would be pos42 (dirright from pos32). So that's pushing the stone further south. But we need to push it north. So to push the stone north from pos32 to pos22, the agent must be at pos32's north neighbor (pos22) and push in the dirleft (since from pos22 to pos32 is dirright, and then from pos32 to pos22 would be dirleft. Wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, the agent is at l_p, which must be adjacent to the stone's position (l_from) such that moving in direction d from l_p gets to l_from. Then, moving in direction d from l_from gets to l_to.

So to push the stone from pos32 to pos22, the direction d must be such that from l_from (pos32), moving in d gets to pos22. The direction from pos32 to pos22 is dirleft (since "You may move from location pos32 to location pos22 following direction dirleft"). So for the action, d is dirleft. Therefore, the agent must be at a position l_p such that moving dirleft from l_p leads to pos32. The positions from which moving dirleft leads to pos32 would be pos42 (since moving dirleft from pos42 would go to pos32: "You may move from location pos42 to location pos32 following direction dirleft"). Wait, no. Looking at the movement definitions, "You may move from location pos42 to location pos32 following direction dirleft". So dirleft from pos42 leads to pos32. So if the agent is at pos42, and the stone is at pos32, then the agent can push the stone in dirleft direction to pos22. Because moving dirleft from pos32 (l_from) would go to pos22 (l_to). But wait, the action requires that l_to is clear. pos22 is clear in the initial state.

Wait, let's check the initial state: pos22 is clear. Yes, in the original state, "Location pos22 is clear". So pushing the stone from pos32 to pos22 would require the agent to be at pos42, pushing dirleft. Then, after pushing, the stone would be at pos22, which is not a goal, so we need to use pushtonongoal. Then, push it again from pos22 to pos12, which is a goal.

So steps would be:

1. Move agent from pos25 to pos42 (to be able to push stone1 from pos32 to pos22)

But how to get from pos25 to pos42.

Path planning: pos25 (2,5) -> dirup to pos24 (2,4). Then dirup to pos23 (2,3). Then dirup to pos22 (2,2). Then dirright to pos32 (3,2). Wait, but pos32 has the stone, so agent can't move there. Alternatively, the agent needs to go around.

Wait, the agent needs to reach pos42. Let's see:

pos25 (2,5) → pos24 (dirup), pos24 → pos34 (dirright), then pos34 → pos44 (dirright), then pos44 → pos54 (dirright). No, that's not helpful. Alternative path: pos25 → pos35 (dirright), pos35 → pos45 (dirright), pos45 → pos55 (dirright). Not helpful.

Alternatively, pos25 → pos24 (dirup), pos24 → pos34 (dirright), pos34 → pos44 (dirright), pos44 → pos43 (dirup), etc. This is getting complicated. Maybe a better approach is to find the path from pos25 to pos42.

pos42 is (4,2). Let's see possible paths:

pos25 (2,5) → pos24 (dirup), pos24 (2,4) → pos34 (dirright), pos34 (3,4) → pos44 (dirright), pos44 (4,4) → pos43 (dirup), pos43 (4,3) → pos42 (dirleft). Wait, directions might vary.

Alternatively, from pos25, move dirright to pos35 (3,5). Then pos35 → pos34 (dirup), pos34 (3,4) → pos33 (dirup), pos33 (3,3) → pos32 (dirup). But pos32 has the stone, so can't move there. Alternatively, pos34 → pos44 (dirright), then pos44 → pos43 (dirup), pos43 → pos42 (dirleft). So:

move player1 pos25 pos35 dirright

move player1 pos35 pos34 dirup

move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright

move player1 pos44 pos43 dirup

move player1 pos43 pos42 dirleft

That's five moves. Then, from pos42, the agent can perform pushtonongoal to push stone1 from pos32 to pos22, dirleft.

Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos22 dirleft

After that, the stone is at pos22. Then, the agent is at pos32. Now, the agent needs to push the stone from pos22 to pos12. pos12 is a goal, so use pushtogoal.

But to push from pos22 to pos12, the agent must be adjacent to pos22 in the direction of the push. pos12 is north of pos22. So direction dirleft (since moving dirleft from pos22 to pos12 is allowed. From pos22, dirleft is to pos12. So the agent needs to be at pos22's south (pos32) and push dirleft. Wait, but after the previous push, the agent is at pos32. So from pos32, can the agent push the stone from pos22 to pos12?

No, because the stone is at pos22. The agent is at pos32. To push the stone north to pos12, the agent needs to be south of pos22 (i.e., at pos32) and push north (dirleft from pos32 to pos22, then dirleft from pos22 to pos12). Wait, the direction d must be the same for both moving from l_p to l_from and from l_from to l_to.

So for the second push (pos22 to pos12), the agent needs to be at a position l_p such that moving dirleft from l_p leads to pos22. Which position is that? For example, pos23. Because from pos23, dirleft would be to pos22. Or pos32, which is south of pos22. Wait, moving dirleft from pos32 to pos22 is allowed. So if the agent is at pos32, then direction dirleft would move to pos22. So the agent can perform the pushtogoal action from pos32, pushing the stone from pos22 to pos12 dirleft.

Wait, but the agent is currently at pos32 after the first push. So the agent is at pos32, the stone is at pos22. So to push the stone from pos22 to pos12, the agent needs to be at a position l_p adjacent to pos22 in the direction opposite to the push. The push direction is dirleft (from pos22 to pos12). So the agent must be at pos22's east (dirright from pos22 is pos32). So agent at pos32 can push the stone from pos22 to pos12 with direction dirleft.

Wait, no. Let's check:

The action is pushtogoal player1 stone1 l_p l_from l_to d.

Preconditions:

(i) agent p is at l_p (pos32)

(ii) stone s is at l_from (pos22)

(iii) l_to (pos12) is clear.

(iv) can move from l_p (pos32) to l_from (pos22) following d. So moving from pos32 to pos22 is dirleft. So d is dirleft.

(v) can move from pos22 to pos12 following d (dirleft). Yes.

(vi) l_to is a goal location (pos12 is a goal).

So the action would be:

pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos22 pos12 dirleft

After this, the stone is at pos12 (goal), which achieves the task.

But wait, after the first push, the agent is at pos32. Then, can the agent move to pos22 to push the stone again? Because after the first push, the agent is at pos32. To push from pos22 to pos12, the agent needs to be at pos32 (since moving dirleft from pos32 to pos22 is allowed). So the agent is already at pos32. So the second action can be pushtogoal.

But wait, after the first action (pushtonongoal), the effects are:

(i) agent is no longer at pos42.

(ii) stone is no longer at pos32.

(iii) pos22 is no longer clear.

(iv) agent is at pos32.

(v) stone is at pos22.

(vi) pos42 is clear.

So after the first push, the agent is at pos32. Then, from pos32, can the agent push the stone from pos22 to pos12? Let's see:

The stone is at pos22. The agent is at pos32. So l_p is pos32, l_from is pos22. But the stone is at pos22. The agent can't push a stone that's at pos22 when the agent is at pos32. Because the stone must be at l_from, which is pos22. But the agent is at pos32, which is adjacent to pos22 (dirleft from pos32 to pos22). So the agent can push the stone from pos22 to pos12 by moving dirleft from pos32 to pos22 (but the stone is already there). Wait, no. The stone is at pos22, and the agent is at pos32. To push the stone north from pos22 to pos12, the agent must be south of the stone (pos32) and push north. But the stone is at pos22. The agent is at pos32. So the agent is south of pos22. So the direction would be dirup (from pos32 to pos22 is dirleft, not dirup. Wait, this is getting confusing again.

Alternatively, perhaps the agent needs to be at pos22's south (pos32) and push north (dirleft) to move the stone to pos12. But how does the direction work here. Let me check the movement directions again.

From pos32, moving dirleft takes you to pos22. From pos22, moving dirleft takes you to pos12. So direction dirleft is consistent. So the agent at pos32 can push the stone from pos22 to pos12 with direction dirleft.

But for the pushtogoal action, the preconditions are:

- agent is at l_p (pos32)

- stone is at l_from (pos22)

- l_to (pos12) is clear.

- can move from l_p (pos32) to l_from (pos22) via direction d (dirleft)

- can move from l_from (pos22) to l_to (pos12) via direction d (dirleft)

- l_to is a goal.

All these are true. pos12 is a goal, and after the first push, pos22 has the stone, pos32 has the agent. pos12 is clear initially. So yes, this action is possible.

So the plan would be:

1. Move agent from pos25 to pos42.

   This requires several move actions. Let's plan the path:

pos25 → pos24 (dirup)

pos24 → pos34 (dirright)

pos34 → pos44 (dirright)

pos44 → pos43 (dirup)

pos43 → pos42 (dirleft)

That's five move actions.

Then:

2. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos22 dirleft

3. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos22 pos12 dirleft

But this plan has 5 move actions plus 2 push actions, totaling 7 actions.

But wait, the constraints must also be satisfied.

The constraints are:

- At least one state where pos55 is not clear.

- At least one state where player1 is at pos23.

- If player1 is at pos23 in any state, there must be an earlier state where pos53 is not clear or player1 is at pos44.

- At least one state where player1 is at pos24.

- Whenever player1 is at pos24 in state s, then in s or a later state, pos45 is not clear or stone1 is at pos11.

So the plan I proposed doesn't satisfy these constraints. For example, the agent is never at pos23 or pos24, and pos55 remains clear. So we need to adjust the plan to include these.

So I need to find a plan that satisfies all constraints.

Let's start by trying to meet the constraints.

First, the plan must include a state where pos55 is not clear. That means either the agent or a stone must be there at some point. Since stone1 is moved to pos12 (goal), which is not pos55, the only way is to have the agent visit pos55. So the agent needs to move to pos55 at some point, making pos55 not clear. But this would add extra steps.

Second, the agent must be at pos23 in some state, with an earlier state where pos53 is not clear or player1 is at pos44.

Third, the agent must be at pos24 in some state.

Fourth, whenever the agent is at pos24, in that state or later, pos45 is not clear or stone1 is at pos11. Since stone1 is moved to pos12, which is a goal, the latter condition (stone1 at pos11) is not part of the plan. So we need to have pos45 not clear in some state after the agent is at pos24.

So, integrating these constraints into the plan.

Let's think:

To make pos55 not clear, the agent can move there. So perhaps after pushing the stone to the goal, the agent can move to pos55. But that adds steps. Alternatively, during the plan, the agent moves to pos55.

To have the agent at pos23, we can adjust the path to go through pos23. For example, after moving to pos24 (which is required for the pos24 constraint), then move to pos23, then proceed.

Additionally, the agent needs to be at pos24. So maybe the initial path already includes pos24 (from pos25 to pos24). So that's covered.

For the pos24 constraint: whenever the agent is at pos24, then in that state or later, pos45 is not clear or stone1 is at pos11. Since stone1 is at pos12 in the end, we need to have pos45 not clear at some point after the agent is at pos24.

pos45 is clear initially. To make it not clear, either the agent or a stone must be there. Since we can't move the stone to pos45 (as it's not a goal), the agent must move to pos45 after being at pos24.

So after being at pos24 (which is in the initial move steps), the agent could later move to pos45, making pos45 not clear.

Also, the agent must be at pos23 at some point. Let's see.

So adjusting the plan:

Original plan steps (without constraints):

1. move player1 pos25 pos24 dirup

2. move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright

3. move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright

4. move player1 pos44 pos43 dirup

5. move player1 pos43 pos42 dirleft

6. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos22 dirleft

7. move player1 pos32 pos22 dirleft

8. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos22 pos12 dirleft

Wait, no. After step 6, the agent is at pos32. Then step 7 would be moving from pos32 to pos22 (dirleft). But pos22 now has the stone. So that's not possible. So after step 6, the agent is at pos32, and the stone is at pos22. Then step 7 would be pushing from pos22 to pos12, but the agent is at pos32. So step 7 is pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos22 pos12 dirleft.

But then after that, the agent is at pos22.

Wait, the effects of pushtogoal are:

(i) agent is no longer at l_p (pos32)

(ii) stone is no longer at pos22

(iii) pos12 is no longer clear

(iv) agent is at pos22

(v) stone is at pos12

(vi) pos32 is clear.

So after step 6, agent is at pos32. Then step 7: pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos22 pos12 dirleft.

After this, agent is at pos22, stone is at pos12 (goal). So the task is achieved.

But the constraints:

- pos55 must be not clear at least once. So the agent needs to move to pos55 after this.

- Agent must be at pos23. So perhaps during the movement, the agent goes through pos23.

- The agent must be at pos24. Which is satisfied in step1.

- When agent is at pos24, then pos45 must be not clear in that state or later. So after step1 (pos24), agent can move to pos45 later.

But how to incorporate these into the plan.

Alternative plan:

After achieving the goal (stone at pos12), the agent moves to pos55 to satisfy the "pos55 not clear" constraint. Also, during the movement, visit pos23 and pos24, and ensure pos45 is visited after pos24.

Let's try:

Steps:

1. move player1 pos25 pos24 dirup (agent at pos24, which covers the pos24 constraint)

2. move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup (agent at pos23, but need to check the constraint: if agent is at pos23, there must be an earlier state where pos53 is not clear or agent is at pos44. So before step2, the agent is at pos24, which doesn't satisfy pos44 or pos53 not clear. So this step would violate the constraint. Therefore, before reaching pos23, the agent must have been at pos44 or pos53 must be not clear.

So we need to adjust the plan to meet this.

So, perhaps after step1 (pos24), agent moves to pos34 (dirright), then to pos44 (dirright). Now agent is at pos44. Then, move to pos43 (dirup), then pos42 (dirleft). But also, after being at pos44, the agent can then move to pos54 (dirright), then pos55 (dirdown). But this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, after step1 (pos24), move to pos34 (dirright), then pos44 (dirright). Now agent is at pos44. Then move to pos45 (dirdown). Now pos45 is not clear (agent is there), which satisfies the pos24 constraint's requirement that after being at pos24, pos45 is not clear in some state.

Then, from pos45, move to pos55 (dirright). Now pos55 is not clear (agent is there).

But how to integrate this into the plan to push the stone.

Alternatively, the agent can first move to pos44 and pos45 to satisfy constraints before pushing the stone.

But this would make the plan longer. But the problem requires an optimal plan, so we need to find the shortest possible.

Alternatively, the agent can take a detour to pos23 after visiting pos44.

Wait, the constraint for pos23 requires that if the agent is at pos23, then there must be an earlier state where pos53 is not clear or agent was at pos44. So if the agent visits pos44 before pos23, then the constraint is satisfied.

So let's plan:

1. move player1 pos25 pos24 dirup (agent at pos24)

2. move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright (agent at pos34)

3. move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright (agent at pos44)

4. move player1 pos44 pos43 dirup (agent at pos43)

5. move player1 pos43 pos42 dirleft (agent at pos42)

6. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos22 dirleft (agent at pos32, stone at pos22)

7. move player1 pos32 pos22 dirleft (agent at pos22, but stone is there? No, after step6, stone is at pos22, so agent can't move there. So this step is invalid.

Ah, right. After step6, the stone is at pos22, and the agent is at pos32. So moving from pos32 to pos22 is impossible because pos22 is occupied by the stone. So the agent can't move there. So the agent must find another path.

After step6, agent is at pos32. Then:

7. move player1 pos32 pos31 dirup (agent at pos31)

8. move player1 pos31 pos21 dirleft (agent at pos21)

9. move player1 pos21 pos11 dirleft (agent at pos11)

10. move player1 pos11 pos12 dirdown (agent at pos12, which is a goal. But we need to make pos55 not clear. So maybe after this, move to pos55.

But this is adding many steps.

Alternatively, after step6, the agent is at pos32. Then:

7. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos22 pos12 dirleft (agent moves to pos22, stone at pos12)

Now, the task is achieved. Then, agent needs to go to pos55.

8. move player1 pos22 pos23 dirdown (agent at pos23)

But how? From pos22, can the agent move to pos23 via dirdown? Let's check the allowed moves:

From pos22, directions include dirdown to pos23. Yes: "You may move from location pos22 to location pos23 following direction dirdown".

So after step7, agent is at pos22. Then step8: move player1 pos22 pos23 dirdown (agent at pos23). This satisfies the constraint that agent is at pos23. Now, for the constraint that if agent is at pos23, there must be an earlier state where pos53 is not clear or agent was at pos44. Earlier, the agent was at pos44 in step3. So this is satisfied.

Then, the agent needs to go to pos55. From pos23, steps:

9. move player1 pos23 pos24 dirdown (agent at pos24)

10. move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright

11. move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright

12. move player1 pos44 pos54 dirright

13. move player1 pos54 pos55 dirdown (agent at pos55, making pos55 not clear)

Now, the constraints:

- pos55 not clear: satisfied in step13.

- agent at pos23: step8.

- agent at pos24: steps1, 9.

- For pos24 constraint: whenever agent is at pos24 (steps1 and 9), then in that state or later, pos45 is not clear or stone1 is at pos11. Stone1 is at pos12, so we need pos45 not clear. pos45 is clear until the agent visits it. So after step9, agent is at pos24. We need pos45 to be not clear at some point after. So after step9, steps could include visiting pos45.

But in the current plan, after step9, agent moves to pos34, then pos44, then pos54, then pos55. pos45 is not visited. So to make pos45 not clear, the agent must visit it. So adjust steps after step9:

9. move player1 pos23 pos24 dirdown (agent at pos24)

10. move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright

11. move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright

12. move player1 pos44 pos45 dirdown (agent at pos45, making pos45 not clear)

13. move player1 pos45 pos55 dirright (agent at pos55)

Now, after step9 (agent at pos24), step12 makes pos45 not clear, satisfying the constraint.

So the full plan would be:

1. move player1 pos25 pos24 dirup

2. move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright

3. move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright

4. move player1 pos44 pos43 dirup

5. move player1 pos43 pos42 dirleft

6. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos22 dirleft

7. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos22 pos12 dirleft

8. move player1 pos22 pos23 dirdown

9. move player1 pos23 pos24 dirdown

10. move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright

11. move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright

12. move player1 pos44 pos45 dirdown

13. move player1 pos45 pos55 dirright

But this plan has 13 actions. However, we need to check if this is the shortest possible. Maybe there's a shorter way.

Alternatively, after step7 (stone at pos12, agent at pos22), the agent can go to pos23, then to pos24, then to pos34, pos44, pos45, pos55.

But this seems lengthy. Is there a shorter path?

Another approach: when the agent is at pos32 after step6, instead of pushing directly to pos12, maybe take a detour to meet constraints.

But that would likely make the plan longer.

Alternatively, integrate the constraint satisfaction steps into the main plan.

For example:

After step1 (pos24), go to pos44, then pos45, then return to the main path.

But that might add steps.

Alternatively, combine steps to meet multiple constraints.

For instance:

1. move player1 pos25 pos24 dirup (pos24 covered)

2. move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright

3. move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright (agent at pos44)

4. move player1 pos44 pos45 dirdown (agent at pos45, meeting pos24's constraint)

5. move player1 pos45 pos44 dirup (back to pos44)

6. move player1 pos44 pos43 dirup

7. move player1 pos43 pos42 dirleft

8. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos22 dirleft

9. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos22 pos12 dirleft

10. move player1 pos22 pos23 dirdown (agent at pos23)

11. move player1 pos23 pos24 dirdown (agent at pos24 again)

12. move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright

13. move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright

14. move player1 pos44 pos54 dirright

15. move player1 pos54 pos55 dirdown (agent at pos55)

This plan has 15 steps, which is longer. So not optimal.

So the initial plan with 13 steps may not be optimal. We need to find a way to satisfy all constraints with as few steps as possible.

Let me think again.

Original plan without constraints: 5 moves to reach pos42, 1 push to pos22, 1 push to pos12. Total 7 actions.

But to meet the constraints, we need to:

- Visit pos24 (done in step1).

- Visit pos23, but with prior visit to pos44 or pos53 not clear.

- Visit pos55.

- Ensure after visiting pos24, pos45 is not clear at some point.

So perhaps after the main plan (7 actions), add the following:

8. move player1 pos22 pos23 dirdown (agent at pos23)

This meets the requirement of being at pos23. But need to have an earlier state where agent was at pos44 or pos53 is not clear.

In the original plan, the agent was at pos44 in step3. So if we include pos44 in the path, then the constraint for pos23 is satisfied.

So the plan:

1. move player1 pos25 pos24 dirup

2. move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright

3. move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright (agent at pos44)

4. move player1 pos44 pos43 dirup

5. move player1 pos43 pos42 dirleft

6. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos22 dirleft

7. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos22 pos12 dirleft

8. move player1 pos22 pos23 dirdown (agent at pos23)

9. move player1 pos23 pos24 dirdown (agent at pos24)

10. move player1 pos24 pos25 dirup (agent back to pos25)

11. move player1 pos25 pos35 dirright

12. move player1 pos35 pos45 dirright

13. move player1 pos45 pos55 dirright (agent at pos55)

Now, this plan has 13 actions. But steps 9-13 are added after the main goal is achieved (step7). However, this may not be optimal.

Alternatively, after achieving the goal (step7), agent is at pos22. Then:

8. move player1 pos22 pos23 dirdown (agent at pos23)

9. move player1 pos23 pos24 dirdown (agent at pos24)

10. move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright

11. move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright

12. move player1 pos44 pos45 dirdown (agent at pos45, making pos45 not clear)

13. move player1 pos45 pos55 dirright (agent at pos55)

This is 13 steps.

But maybe there's a shorter way.

Wait, after step7 (agent at pos22), the agent can go to pos23 (step8), then to pos24 (step9), then move to pos34, pos44, pos45 (steps10-12), then to pos55 (step13).

That's 13 steps. But the problem requires an optimal plan with the shortest possible length. So perhaps there's a way to combine steps.

For example, after step7 (agent at pos22), the agent can go directly to pos55, but that would require a long path. Alternatively, visit pos45 and pos55 on the way back.

But perhaps the minimal steps required to satisfy all constraints would be 13. But maybe there's a smarter way.

Another approach: during the initial movement to pos42, include a visit to pos44 and pos45.

For example:

1. move pos25 → pos24 (dirup)

2. move pos24 → pos34 (dirright)

3. move pos34 → pos44 (dirright)

4. move pos44 → pos45 (dirdown) [now pos45 is not clear]

5. move pos45 → pos44 (dirup)

6. move pos44 → pos43 (dirup)

7. move pos43 → pos42 (dirleft)

8. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos22 dirleft

9. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos22 pos12 dirleft

10. move player1 pos22 → pos23 dirdown

11. move player1 pos23 → pos24 dirdown

12. move player1 pos24 → pos34 dirright

13. move player1 pos34 → pos44 dirright

14. move player1 pos44 → pos54 dirright

15. move player1 pos54 → pos55 dirdown

This has 15 steps. Not better.

Alternatively, after step4 (pos45), the agent can go directly to pos55, but that requires steps:

4. move pos44 → pos45 (dirdown)

5. move pos45 → pos55 (dirright)

Now pos55 is not clear. Then proceed to move back to pos44:

6. move pos55 → pos45 dirleft

7. move pos45 → pos44 dirup

But this is adding steps.

So it's challenging to find a shorter plan. Perhaps the minimal number of actions is around 13.

But let's think differently. Maybe when moving the agent to pos42, take a path that includes pos44 and pos45 to satisfy the constraints early.

Original path to pos42 was:

1. pos25 → pos24 (dirup)

2. pos24 → pos34 (dirright)

3. pos34 → pos44 (dirright)

4. pos44 → pos43 (dirup)

5. pos43 → pos42 (dirleft)

But instead, after step3 (pos44), go to pos45:

4. pos44 → pos45 (dirdown) [agent at pos45, pos45 not clear]

5. pos45 → pos44 (dirup)

6. pos44 → pos43 (dirup)

7. pos43 → pos42 (dirleft)

Now, after step4, pos45 is not clear. So any state where agent is at pos24 (step1) now has a subsequent state (step4) where pos45 is not clear, satisfying the constraint for pos24.

Then proceed with pushing the stone:

8. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos22 dirleft

9. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos22 pos12 dirleft

Then, move to pos23:

10. move player1 pos22 → pos23 dirdown

Then, move to pos55:

11. move player1 pos23 → pos24 dirdown

12. move player1 pos24 → pos34 dirright

13. move player1 pos34 → pos44 dirright

14. move player1 pos44 → pos54 dirright

15. move player1 pos54 → pos55 dirdown

But this is 15 steps. However, after step4, the pos24 constraint is satisfied. Then, after step10, the pos23 constraint is satisfied because the agent was at pos44 in step3. Then, step15 meets the pos55 constraint.

But this is still 15 steps. Not optimal.

Alternatively, after step4 (pos45), the agent could move directly to pos55:

5. pos45 → pos55 (dirright)

Now pos55 is not clear. Then, agent needs to return to pos45 and continue to pos42.

But this is adding steps.

I think the optimal plan is likely to have around 13 steps. But perhaps there's a smarter way.

Wait, another idea: after pushing the stone to pos12 (step7), the agent is at pos22. Then:

8. move player1 pos22 → pos23 dirdown (meets pos23 constraint, earlier visited pos44 in step3)

9. move player1 pos23 → pos24 dirdown (meets pos24 again)

10. move player1 pos24 → pos34 dirright

11. move player1 pos34 → pos44 dirright

12. move player1 pos44 → pos45 dirdown (pos45 not clear)

13. move player1 pos45 → pos55 dirright (pos55 not clear)

This is 13 steps. Let's count:

Steps 1-7: original 7 steps.

Steps 8-13: 6 steps.

Total 13 steps.

So the full plan is:

```
move player1 pos25 pos24 dirup
move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright
move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright
move player1 pos44 pos43 dirup
move player1 pos43 pos42 dirleft
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos22 dirleft
pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos22 pos12 dirleft
move player1 pos22 pos23 dirdown
move player1 pos23 pos24 dirdown
move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright
move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright
move player1 pos44 pos45 dirdown
move player1 pos45 pos55 dirright
```

This plan has 13 actions. Let's verify the constraints:

1. pos55 is not clear in step13. Satisfied.

2. player1 is at pos23 in step8. Satisfied.

3. For step8, the earlier state where player1 was at pos44 is step3. So constraint satisfied.

4. player1 is at pos24 in steps1 and9. Satisfied.

5. For step9 (player1 at pos24), in step12, player1 is at pos45, making pos45 not clear. So constraint satisfied.

Yes, all constraints are met.

But is this the shortest possible? Let's see if any steps can be optimized.

After step7, the agent is at pos22. Then steps8-13 are needed to meet constraints. Can we find a shorter path from pos22 to pos55 that covers pos23, pos24, pos45, and pos55?

For example:

From pos22:

8. move to pos23 (dirdown)

9. move to pos24 (dirdown)

10. move to pos34 (dirright)

11. move to pos44 (dirright)

12. move to pos45 (dirdown)

13. move to pos55 (dirright)

That's 6 steps. So the total is 13 steps.

I don't see a way to shorten this further. Therefore, this plan is likely optimal.
