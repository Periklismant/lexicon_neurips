Let me understand the problem. We have a grid world where the agent (player1) needs to move a stone (stone1) to a goal position. The goal position is pos53.

Initially, player1 is at pos24 and stone1 is at pos32. We need to move stone1 to pos53, which is a goal location.

We have several constraints that must be satisfied:
1. At some point, player1 must be at pos35 and stone1 must be at pos22 simultaneously.
2. At some point, either stone1 must be at pos41 or pos45 must not be clear.
3. At some point, player1 must be at pos22.
4. If player1 is at pos22, there must be an earlier state where pos21 is not clear.

Let's first understand the grid layout based on the available movements:

- The first digit of each position seems to be a row index, and the second digit a column index.
- So pos11 is the top-left corner, and pos55 is the bottom-right corner.
- We can move in four directions: up, down, left, and right.

Let's plan how to satisfy the constraints:

1. Constraint: player1 at pos35 and stone1 at pos22
   - We need to move stone1 from pos32 to pos22 (left), and then move player1 to pos35.

2. Constraint: stone1 at pos41 or pos45 not clear
   - Since we're moving the stone to a goal at pos53, we can decide to move it through pos41 on its way.

3. Constraint: player1 at pos22
   - We'll ensure player1 visits pos22 during the plan.

4. Constraint: Before player1 at pos22, pos21 is not clear
   - We'll ensure pos21 is not clear (has a stone or the player) before player1 moves to pos22.

Now, let's develop a plan:

1. Initial state:
   - player1 at pos24
   - stone1 at pos32

Let's start by moving player1 to a position from where they can push stone1:

1. Move player1 from pos24 to pos23 (up)
2. Move player1 from pos23 to pos33 (right)
3. Move player1 from pos33 to pos32 (up)

But there's a problem here. The problem statement says both pos24 and pos32 are clear, but player1 is at pos24 and stone1 is at pos32. Let me revisit the description...

It seems there's a discrepancy in the problem statement. The preconditions for an action like "move" say that a location must be clear to move into, but also say that the agent is at a location. Similarly, the preconditions for "pushtogoal" and "pushtonongoal" say a stone is at a location. Since the initial state says "Location pos24 is clear" and "Location pos32 is clear", I believe this might be an error.

Let me assume that at the beginning:
- player1 is at pos24
- stone1 is at pos32

And locations pos24 and pos32 are not clear (because they contain the player and the stone respectively).

Now let's re-plan:

1. Move player1 from pos24 to pos34 (right)
2. Move player1 from pos34 to pos33 (up)
3. PushToNonGoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos32 pos31 dirup
   - Now stone1 is at pos31, player1 is at pos32

4. Move player1 from pos32 to pos22 (left)
   - This satisfies constraint 3. We now need to make sure constraint 4 is satisfied, which means pos21 must not be clear before this.
   - But I don't see a straightforward way to make pos21 not clear before player1 is at pos22. It's a constraint that's hard to satisfy given the current plan.

Let me re-think the entire plan:

1. Since we need player1 at pos35 and stone1 at pos22 simultaneously (constraint 1), let's focus on this first.
2. Also, since before player1 is at pos22, pos21 must not be clear (constraint 4), we might need to push the stone to pos21 first.

New plan:
1. Move player1 from pos24 to pos23 (up)
2. Move player1 from pos23 to pos33 (right)
3. Push stone1 from pos32 to pos22 (left)
   - Now stone1 is at pos22, player1 is at pos32

4. Move player1 from pos32 to pos33 (down)
5. Move player1 from pos33 to pos34 (down)
6. Move player1 from pos34 to pos35 (down)
   - Now player1 is at pos35 and stone1 is at pos22, satisfying constraint 1.

7. Move player1 from pos35 to pos34 (up)
8. Move player1 from pos34 to pos33 (up)
9. Move player1 from pos33 to pos32 (up)
10. PushToNonGoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos22 pos21 dirleft
    - Now stone1 is at pos21, player1 is at pos22, satisfying constraint 3 and 4 (since pos21 is not clear because of the stone).

11. PushToNonGoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos21 pos31 dirright
    - Now stone1 is at pos31, player1 is at pos21

12. Move player1 from pos21 to pos31 (right)
13. PushToNonGoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos31 pos41 dirright
    - Now stone1 is at pos41, player1 is at pos31, satisfying constraint 2.

14. Move player1 from pos31 to pos41 (right)
15. PushToNonGoal player1 stone1 pos41 pos41 pos42 dirdown
    - Now stone1 is at pos42, player1 is at pos41

16. Move player1 from pos41 to pos42 (down)
17. PushToNonGoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos42 pos43 dirdown
    - Now stone1 is at pos43, player1 is at pos42

18. Move player1 from pos42 to pos43 (down)
19. PushToGoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos43 pos53 dirright
    - Now stone1 is at pos53 (a goal location), player1 is at pos43, satisfying the main goal.

Let me validate this plan against the constraints:
1. At some point, player1 is at pos35 and stone1 is at pos22 (satisfied in step 6)
2. At some point, stone1 is at pos41 (satisfied in step 14)
3. At some point, player1 is at pos22 (satisfied in step 10)
4. Before player1 is at pos22, pos21 is not clear (satisfied in step 10, since stone1 is at pos21)

Wait, I think I have a misconception. Let me revisit the constraints:

The constraint "If player1 is at location pos22, then there must be an earlier state in which pos21 is not clear" means that before player1 is at pos22, there must be an earlier state where pos21 is not clear, not that pos21 must be not clear just before player1 is at pos22.

So, our plan needs to ensure that at some point before player1 is at pos22, pos21 must not be clear, which can be due to the player or the stone.

Let me refine the plan:

1. Move player1 from pos24 to pos23 (up)
2. Move player1 from pos23 to pos22 (up)
   - Now player1 is at pos22, satisfying constraint 3.
   - But we didn't satisfy constraint 4. Before player1 is at pos22, pos21 must not be clear. So, let's revise.

Let's think differently. We can make pos21 not clear by having the player there first.

1. Move player1 from pos24 to pos23 (up)
2. Move player1 from pos23 to pos22 (up)
3. Move player1 from pos22 to pos21 (up)
   - Now pos21 is not clear because player1 is there.

4. Move player1 from pos21 to pos22 (down)
   - Now player1 is at pos22, satisfying constraint 3, and before that, pos21 was not clear, satisfying constraint 4.

5. Move player1 from pos22 to pos32 (right)
6. PushToNonGoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos32 pos22 dirleft
   - Now stone1 is at pos22, player1 is at pos32

7. Move player1 from pos32 to pos33 (down)
8. Move player1 from pos33 to pos34 (down)
9. Move player1 from pos34 to pos35 (down)
   - Now player1 is at pos35 and stone1 is at pos22, satisfying constraint 1.

10. Move player1 from pos35 to pos34 (up)
11. Move player1 from pos34 to pos33 (up)
12. Move player1 from pos33 to pos32 (up)
13. PushToNonGoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos22 pos21 dirleft
    - Now stone1 is at pos21, player1 is at pos22

14. Move player1 from pos22 to pos32 (right)
15. Move player1 from pos32 to pos31 (up)
16. PushToNonGoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos21 pos31 dirright
    - Now stone1 is at pos31, player1 is at pos21

17. Move player1 from pos21 to pos31 (right)
18. PushToNonGoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos31 pos41 dirright
    - Now stone1 is at pos41, player1 is at pos31, satisfying constraint 2.

19. Move player1 from pos31 to pos41 (right)
20. PushToNonGoal player1 stone1 pos41 pos41 pos42 dirdown
    - Now stone1 is at pos42, player1 is at pos41

21. Move player1 from pos41 to pos42 (down)
22. PushToNonGoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos42 pos43 dirdown
    - Now stone1 is at pos43, player1 is at pos42

23. Move player1 from pos42 to pos43 (down)
24. PushToGoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos43 pos53 dirright
    - Now stone1 is at pos53 (a goal location), player1 is at pos43, satisfying the main goal.

Wait, I think I have an issue with my understanding of the "push" actions:

"pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": This action pushes stone s from location l_from to goal location l_to, and the agent p starts at location l_p.

Preconditions:
1. Agent p is at location l_p
2. Stone s is at location l_from
3. Location l_to is clear
4. You can get from l_p to l_from following direction d
5. You can get from l_from to l_to following direction d
6. l_to is a goal location

Effects:
1. Agent p is no longer at l_p
2. Stone s is no longer at l_from
3. Location l_to is no longer clear
4. Agent p is at l_from
5. Stone s is at l_to
6. Location l_p is clear
7. Stone s is at a goal state

So, the agent needs to be adjacent to the stone in the direction it wants to push, and after pushing, the agent is where the stone was, and the stone is at the new location.

Given this, let me rethink my plan. I want to think more clearly about the exact sequence of actions and their effects.

Let me start from the beginning:

Initial state:
- player1 is at pos24
- stone1 is at pos32

1. To push stone1 from pos32 to pos22, player1 needs to be at pos42 and then push the stone in the "dirleft" direction.
   - Move player1 from pos24 to pos34 (right)
   - Move player1 from pos34 to pos44 (right)
   - Move player1 from pos44 to pos43 (up)
   - Move player1 from pos43 to pos42 (up)
   - PushToNonGoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos22 dirleft
     - Now player1 is at pos32 and stone1 is at pos22

2. To satisfy constraint 1 (player1 at pos35 and stone1 at pos22), we need to move player1 from pos32 to pos35.
   - Move player1 from pos32 to pos33 (down)
   - Move player1 from pos33 to pos34 (down)
   - Move player1 from pos34 to pos35 (down)
     - Now player1 is at pos35 and stone1 is at pos22, satisfying constraint 1.

3. To satisfy constraint 3 and 4 (player1 at pos22 after pos21 is not clear), we first need to make pos21 not clear.
   - Move player1 from pos35 to pos34 (up)
   - Move player1 from pos34 to pos33 (up)
   - Move player1 from pos33 to pos32 (up)
   - Move player1 from pos32 to pos31 (up)
   - Move player1 from pos31 to pos21 (left)
     - Now pos21 is not clear because player1 is there.
   - Move player1 from pos21 to pos22 (down)
     - Now player1 is at pos22, satisfying constraint 3, and before that, pos21 was not clear, satisfying constraint 4.

4. Now, let's push stone1 to satisfy constraint 2 (stone1 at pos41).
   - Move player1 from pos22 to pos23 (down)
   - Move player1 from pos23 to pos24 (down)
   - Move player1 from pos24 to pos25 (down)
   - Move player1 from pos25 to pos35 (right)
   - Move player1 from pos35 to pos34 (up)
   - Move player1 from pos34 to pos33 (up)
   - Move player1 from pos33 to pos32 (up)
   - Move player1 from pos32 to pos31 (up)
   - Move player1 from pos31 to pos21 (left)
   - Move player1 from pos21 to pos11 (left)
   - Move player1 from pos11 to pos12 (down)
   - PushToNonGoal player1 stone1 pos12 pos22 pos32 dirright
     - Now player1 is at pos22 and stone1 is at pos32.
   - Move player1 from pos22 to pos32 (right)
   - Move player1 from pos32 to pos42 (right)
   - PushToNonGoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos31 dirleft
     - Now player1 is at pos32 and stone1 is at pos31.
   - Move player1 from pos32 to pos31 (up)
   - Move player1 from pos31 to pos41 (right)
   - PushToNonGoal player1 stone1 pos41 pos31 pos21 dirleft
     - Now player1 is at pos31 and stone1 is at pos21.
   - Move player1 from pos31 to pos21 (left)
   - Move player1 from pos21 to pos31 (right)
   - PushToNonGoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos21 pos31 dirright
     - Now player1 is at pos21 and stone1 is at pos31.
   - Move player1 from pos21 to pos31 (right)
   - Move player1 from pos31 to pos41 (right)
   - PushToNonGoal player1 stone1 pos41 pos31 pos41 dirright
     - Now player1 is at pos31 and stone1 is at pos41, satisfying constraint 2.

5. Finally, let's push stone1 to the goal location pos53.
   - Move player1 from pos31 to pos41 (right)
   - Move player1 from pos41 to pos42 (down)
   - PushToNonGoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos41 pos42 dirdown
     - Now player1 is at pos41 and stone1 is at pos42.
   - Move player1 from pos41 to pos42 (down)
   - Move player1 from pos42 to pos43 (down)
   - PushToNonGoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos42 pos43 dirdown
     - Now player1 is at pos42 and stone1 is at pos43.
   - Move player1 from pos42 to pos43 (down)
   - Move player1 from pos43 to pos53 (right)
   - PushToGoal player1 stone1 pos53 pos43 pos53 dirright
     - Now player1 is at pos43 and stone1 is at pos53 (a goal location), satisfying the main goal.

Wait, I see some issues with my plan. Let me correct them:

1. In the PushToNonGoal and PushToGoal actions, the player needs to be adjacent to the stone in the direction from which they'll push. If the player is at pos42, they can push a stone from pos32 to pos22, but not push a stone from pos41 to pos42. The player needs to be at pos40 (if such a position exists) to push a stone from pos41 to pos42.

2. There's no position like pos40, so to push a stone from pos41 to pos42, the player would need to be at pos31 and push in the dirright direction.

Let me correct the plan based on these insights:

Initial state:
- player1 is at pos24
- stone1 is at pos32

1. To push stone1 from pos32 to pos22, player1 needs to be at pos42 and then push the stone in the "dirleft" direction.
   - Move player1 from pos24 to pos34 (right)
   - Move player1 from pos34 to pos44 (right)
   - Move player1 from pos44 to pos43 (up)
   - Move player1 from pos43 to pos42 (up)
   - PushToNonGoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos22 dirleft
     - Now player1 is at pos32 and stone1 is at pos22

2. To satisfy constraint 1 (player1 at pos35 and stone1 at pos22), we need to move player1 from pos32 to pos35.
   - Move player1 from pos32 to pos33 (down)
   - Move player1 from pos33 to pos34 (down)
   - Move player1 from pos34 to pos35 (down)
     - Now player1 is at pos35 and stone1 is at pos22, satisfying constraint 1.

3. To satisfy constraint 3 and 4 (player1 at pos22 after pos21 is not clear), we first need to make pos21 not clear.
   - Move player1 from pos35 to pos34 (up)
   - Move player1 from pos34 to pos33 (up)
   - Move player1 from pos33 to pos32 (up)
   - Move player1 from pos32 to pos31 (up)
   - Move player1 from pos31 to pos21 (left)
     - Now pos21 is not clear because player1 is there.
   - Move player1 from pos21 to pos22 (down)
     - Now player1 is at pos22, satisfying constraint 3, and before that, pos21 was not clear, satisfying constraint 4.

4. Now, let's push stone1 to satisfy constraint 2 (stone1 at pos41).
   - PushToNonGoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos22 pos32 dirright
     - Now player1 is at pos22 and stone1 is at pos32.
   - Move player1 from pos22 to pos32 (right)
   - Move player1 from pos32 to pos42 (right)
   - PushToNonGoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos31 dirleft
     - Now player1 is at pos32 and stone1 is at pos31.
   - Move player1 from pos32 to pos31 (up)
   - Move player1 from pos31 to pos41 (right)
   - PushToNonGoal player1 stone1 pos41 pos31 pos21 dirleft
     - Now player1 is at pos31 and stone1 is at pos21.
   - Move player1 from pos31 to pos21 (left)
   - Move player1 from pos21 to pos31 (right)
   - PushToNonGoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos21 pos31 dirright
     - Now player1 is at pos21 and stone1 is at pos31.
   - Move player1 from pos21 to pos31 (right)
   - Move player1 from pos31 to pos41 (right)
     - Now player1 is at pos41 and stone1 is at pos31, satisfying constraint 2 since stone1 is at pos41.

5. Finally, let's push stone1 to the goal location pos53.
   - PushToNonGoal player1 stone1 pos41 pos31 pos32 dirdown
     - Now player1 is at pos31 and stone1 is at pos32.
   - Move player1 from pos31 to pos32 (down)
   - Move player1 from pos32 to pos33 (down)
   - PushToNonGoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos32 pos42 dirright
     - Now player1 is at pos32 and stone1 is at pos42.
   - Move player1 from pos32 to pos42 (right)
   - Move player1 from pos42 to pos43 (down)
   - PushToNonGoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos42 pos43 dirdown
     - Now player1 is at pos42 and stone1 is at pos43.
   - Move player1 from pos42 to pos43 (down)
   - PushToGoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos43 pos53 dirright
     - Now player1 is at pos43 and stone1 is at pos53 (a goal location), satisfying the main goal.

Wait, I misread constraint 2. It's not that we need stone1 at pos41, but that we need EITHER stone1 at pos41 OR pos45 not clear. Since we're already planning to move stone1, we can just push it through pos41.

Also, there's an issue in step 4 where I wrote "Now player1 is at pos41 and stone1 is at pos31, satisfying constraint 2 since stone1 is at pos41." which is incorrect. The player and the stone can't be at different locations simultaneously.

Let's correct the plan:

Initial state:
- player1 is at pos24
- stone1 is at pos32

1. To push stone1 from pos32 to pos22, player1 needs to be at pos42 and then push the stone in the "dirleft" direction.
   - Move player1 from pos24 to pos34 (right)
   - Move player1 from pos34 to pos44 (right)
   - Move player1 from pos44 to pos43 (up)
   - Move player1 from pos43 to pos42 (up)
   - PushToNonGoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos22 dirleft
     - Now player1 is at pos32 and stone1 is at pos22

2. To satisfy constraint 1 (player1 at pos35 and stone1 at pos22), we need to move player1 from pos32 to pos35.
   - Move player1 from pos32 to pos33 (down)
   - Move player1 from pos33 to pos34 (down)
   - Move player1 from pos34 to pos35 (down)
     - Now player1 is at pos35 and stone1 is at pos22, satisfying constraint 1.

3. To satisfy constraint 3 and 4 (player1 at pos22 after pos21is not clear), we first need to make pos21 not clear.
   - Move player1 from pos35 to pos34 (up)
   - Move player1 from pos34 to pos33 (up)
   - Move player1 from pos33 to pos23 (left)
   - Move player1 from pos23 to pos13 (left)
   - Move player1 from pos13 to pos12 (up)
   - Move player1 from pos12 to pos11 (up)
   - Move player1 from pos11 to pos21 (right)
     - Now pos21 is not clear because player1 is there.
   - Move player1 from pos21 to pos22 (down)
     - Now player1 is at pos22, satisfying constraint 3, and before that, pos21 was not clear, satisfying constraint 4.

4. Now, let's push stone1 to satisfy constraint 2 (stone1 at pos41 or pos45 not clear). We'll move stone1 to pos41.
   - PushToNonGoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos22 pos32 dirright
     - Now player1 is at pos22 and stone1 is at pos32.
   - Move player1 from pos22 to pos21 (up)
   - Move player1 from pos21 to pos31 (right)
   - PushToNonGoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos32 pos42 dirright
     - Now player1 is at pos32 and stone1 is at pos42.
   - Move player1 from pos32 to pos31 (up)
   - Move player1 from pos31 to pos41 (right)
   - PushToNonGoal player1 stone1 pos41 pos42 pos41 dirup
     - Now player1 is at pos42 and stone1 is at pos41, satisfying constraint 2.

5. Finally, let's push stone1 to the goal location pos53.
   - Move player1 from pos42 to pos41 (up)
   - Move player1 from pos41 to pos42 (down)
   - PushToNonGoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos41 pos42 dirdown
     - Now player1 is at pos41 and stone1 is at pos42.
   - Move player1 from pos41 to pos42 (down)
   - Move player1 from pos42 to pos43 (down)
   - PushToNonGoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos42 pos43 dirdown
     - Now player1 is at pos42 and stone1 is at pos43.
   - Move player1 from pos42 to pos43 (down)
   - PushToGoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos43 pos53 dirright
     - Now player1 is at pos43 and stone1 is at pos53 (a goal location), satisfying the main goal.

Hmm, I'm running into issues with the "push" action. Let me review the PushToNonGoal action:

"pushtonongoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": Make agent p, situated at location l_p, push stone s from location l_from to non-goal location l_to, following direction d.

Preconditions:
1. Agent p is at location l_p
2. Stone s is at location l_from
3. Location l_to is clear
4. You can get from l_p to l_from following direction d
5. You can get from l_from to l_to following direction d
6. Location l_to is not a goal location

So if the agent is at pos42 and the stone is at pos32, and we want to push the stone to pos22 using the "dirleft" direction, we'd have:
- l_p = pos42
- l_from = pos32
- l_to = pos22
- d = dirleft

This means:
1. Agent is at pos42
2. Stone is at pos32
3. pos22 is clear
4. You can get from pos42 to pos32 following dirleft (which implies pos42 is to the right of pos32)
5. You can get from pos32 to pos22 following dirleft (which implies pos32 is to the right of pos22)
6. pos22 is not a goal location

Given the problem statement, this plan should work.

Let's revisit the entire plan to make sure it's correct, including all the stepping motion and ensure all the constraints are met:

Initial state:
- player1 is at pos24
- stone1 is at pos32

1. To push stone1 from pos32 to pos22, player1 needs to be at pos42 and then push the stone in the "dirleft" direction.
   - Move player1 from pos24 to pos34 (right)
   - Move player1 from pos34 to pos44 (right)
   - Move player1 from pos44 to pos43 (up)
   - Move player1 from pos43 to pos42 (up)
   - PushToNonGoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos22 dirleft
     - Now player1 is at pos32 and stone1 is at pos22

2. To satisfy constraint 1 (player1 at pos35 and stone1 at pos22), we need to move player1 from pos32 to pos35.
   - Move player1 from pos32 to pos33 (down)
   - Move player1 from pos33 to pos34 (down)
   - Move player1 from pos34 to pos35 (down)
     - Now player1 is at pos35 and stone1 is at pos22, satisfying constraint 1.

3. To satisfy constraint 3 and 4 (player1 at pos22 after pos21 is not clear), we first need to make pos21 not clear.
   - Move player1 from pos35 to pos34 (up)
   - Move player1 from pos34 to pos33 (up)
   - Move player1 from pos33 to pos23 (left)
   - Move player1 from pos23 to pos13 (left)
   - Move player1 from pos13 to pos12 (up)
   - Move player1 from pos12 to pos11 (up)
   - Move player1 from pos11 to pos21 (right)
     - Now pos21 is not clear because player1 is there.
   - Move player1 from pos21 to pos22 (down)
     - Now player1 is at pos22, satisfying constraint 3, and before that, pos21 was not clear, satisfying constraint 4.

4. Now, let's push stone1 to satisfy constraint 2 (stone1 at pos41 or pos45 not clear). We'll move stone1 to pos41.
   - Move player1 from pos22 to pos32 (right)
   - Move player1 from pos32 to pos42 (right)
   - Move player1 from pos42 to pos43 (down)
   - Move player1 from pos43 to pos44 (down)
   - Move player1 from pos44 to pos45 (down)
     - Now pos45 is not clear because player1 is there, satisfying constraint 2.
   - Move player1 from pos45 to pos44 (up)
   - Move player1 from pos44 to pos43 (up)
   - Move player1 from pos43 to pos33 (left)
   - Move player1 from pos33 to pos23 (left)
   - Move player1 from pos23 to pos13 (left)
   - Move player1 from pos13 to pos12 (up)
   - PushToNonGoal player1 stone1 pos12 pos22 pos32 dirright
     - Now player1 is at pos22 and stone1 is at pos32.

5. Finally, let's push stone1 to the goal location pos53.
   - Move player1 from pos22 to pos32 (right)
   - Move player1 from pos32 to pos33 (down)
   - PushToNonGoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos32 pos42 dirright
     - Now player1 is at pos32 and stone1 is at pos42.
   - Move player1 from pos32 to pos42 (right)
   - Move player1 from pos42 to pos43 (down)
   - PushToNonGoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos42 pos43 dirdown
     - Now player1 is at pos42 and stone1 is at pos43.
   - Move player1 from pos42 to pos43 (down)
   - PushToGoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos43 pos53 dirright
     - Now player1 is at pos43 and stone1 is at pos53 (a goal location), satisfying the main goal.

Wait a moment, the way I've been thinking about it, pos11 is not the top-left corner. It's the top-left corner of the grid. Let me reconsider the grid layout:

1 2 3 4 5 (columns)
1 pos11 pos12 pos13 pos14 pos15
2 pos21 pos22 pos23 pos24 pos25
3 pos31 pos32 pos33 pos34 pos35
4 pos41 pos42 pos43 pos44 pos45
5 pos51 pos52 pos53 pos54 pos55
(rows)

Given this layout:
- player1 is initially at pos24 (row 2, column 4)
- stone1 is initially at pos32 (row 3, column 2)
- The goal position is pos53 (row 5, column 3)

Now, let's correct the plan for the pushing actions:

If the agent is at pos42 and the stone is at pos32, and we want to push the stone to pos22, we'd use the "dirup" direction (because we're pushing the stone up from pos32 to pos22). The directions make more intuitive sense now:
- dirup: Move from a higher row number to a lower row number (e.g., from pos32 to pos22)
- dirdown: Move from a lower row number to a higher row number (e.g., from pos22 to pos32)
- dirleft: Move from a higher column number to a lower column number (e.g., from pos23 to pos22)
- dirright: Move from a lower column number to a higher column number (e.g., from pos22 to pos23)

With this in mind, let's correct the plan:

Initial state:
- player1 is at pos24
- stone1 is at pos32

1. To push stone1 from pos32 to pos22, player1 needs to be at pos42 and then push the stone up using the "dirup" direction.
   - Move player1 from pos24 to pos34 (down)
   - Move player1 from pos34 to pos44 (down)
   - Move player1 from pos44 to pos43 (left)
   - Move player1 from pos43 to pos42 (left)
   - PushToNonGoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos22 dirup
     - Now player1 is at pos32 and stone1 is at pos22

2. To satisfy constraint 1 (player1 at pos35 and stone1 at pos22), we need to move player1 from pos32 to pos35.
   - Move player1 from pos32 to pos33 (right)
   - Move player1 from pos33 to pos34 (right)
   - Move player1 from pos34 to pos35 (right)
     - Now player1 is at pos35 and stone1 is at pos22, satisfying constraint 1.

3. To satisfy constraint 3 and 4 (player1 at pos22 after pos21 is not clear), we first need to make pos21 not clear.
   - Move player1 from pos35 to pos34 (left)
   - Move player1 from pos34 to pos33 (left)
   - Move player1 from pos33 to pos23 (up)
   - Move player1 from pos23 to pos13 (up)
   - Move player1 from pos13 to pos12 (left)
   - Move player1 from pos12 to pos11 (left)
   - Move player1 from pos11 to pos21 (down)
     - Now pos21 is not clear because player1 is there.
   - Move player1 from pos21 to pos22 (right)
     - Now player1 is at pos22, satisfying constraint 3, and before that, pos21 was not clear, satisfying constraint 4.

4. Now, let's satisfy constraint 2 (stone1 at pos41 or pos45 not clear). We'll make pos45 not clear.
   - Move player1 from pos22 to pos32 (down)
   - Move player1 from pos32 to pos42 (down)
   - Move player1 from pos42 to pos43 (right)
   - Move player1 from pos43 to pos44 (right)
   - Move player1 from pos44 to pos45 (right)
     - Now pos45 is not clear because player1 is there, satisfying constraint 2.

5. Finally, let's push stone1 to the goal location pos53.
   - Move player1 from pos45 to pos44 (left)
   - Move player1 from pos44 to pos43 (left)
   - Move player1 from pos43 to pos33 (up)
   - Move player1 from pos33 to pos23 (up)
   - Move player1 from pos23 to pos22 (left)
   - Move player1 from pos22 to pos21 (left)
   - Move player1 from pos21 to pos31 (down)
   - Move player1 from pos31 to pos32 (right)
   - Move player1 from pos32 to pos22 (up)
   - PushToNonGoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos22 pos32 dirdown
     - Now player1 is at pos22 and stone1 is at pos32.
   - Move player1 from pos22 to pos32 (down)
   - Move player1 from pos32 to pos42 (down)
   - PushToNonGoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos33 dirright
     - Now player1 is at pos32 and stone1 is at pos33.
   - Move player1 from pos32 to pos33 (right)
   - Move player1 from pos33 to pos43 (down)
   - PushToNonGoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos33 pos34 dirright
     - Now player1 is at pos33 and stone1 is at pos34.
   - Move player1 from pos33 to pos34 (right)
   - Move player1 from pos34 to pos44 (down)
   - PushToNonGoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos34 pos35 dirright
     - Now player1 is at pos34 and stone1 is at pos35.
   - Move player1 from pos34 to pos35 (right)
   - Move player1 from pos35 to pos45 (down)
   - PushToNonGoal player1 stone1 pos45 pos35 pos34 dirleft
     - Now player1 is at pos35 and stone1 is at pos34.
   - Move player1 from pos35 to pos34 (left)
   - Move player1 from pos34 to pos44 (down)
   - PushToNonGoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos34 pos33 dirleft
     - Now player1 is at pos34 and stone1 is at pos33.
   - Move player1 from pos34 to pos33 (left)
   - Move player1 from pos33 to pos43 (down)
   - PushToNonGoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos33 pos43 dirdown
     - Now player1 is at pos33 and stone1 is at pos43.
   - Move player1 from pos33 to pos43 (down)
   - PushToGoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos43 pos53 dirright
     - Now player1 is at pos43 and stone1 is at pos53 (a goal location), satisfying the main goal.

But wait, I think I've been making a conceptual error about the pushing actions. Let's revisit the preconditions and effects of the PushToNonGoal action:

Preconditions:
1. Agent p is at location l_p
2. Stone s is at location l_from
3. Location l_to is clear
4. You can get from l_p to l_from following direction d
5. You can get from l_from to l_to following direction d
6. Location l_to is not a goal location

So, if the agent is at pos42 and wants to push a stone from pos32 to pos22, the direction d should be the one from pos42 to pos32, which is "dirup". And also, from pos32 to pos22, the direction is "dirup". The direction d is the same for both, and it's the direction from the agent to the stone to the target.

Let me try to clarify this with an example:
If the agent is at (3,2) and the stone is at (2,2) and we want to push it to (1,2), the direction is up. The agent is "behind" the stone, pushing it forward.

If the agent is at (2,3) and the stone is at (2,2) and we want to push it to (2,1), the direction is left. Again, the agent is "behind" the stone.

But wait, the problem statement says "pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": Make agent p, situated at location l_p, push stone s from location l_from to goal location l_to, following direction d.

Preconditions include: "You can get from l_p to l_from following direction d" and "You can get from l_from to l_to following direction d".

This suggests that d is the direction from l_p to l_from (agent to stone) and also from l_from to l_to (stone to target). But if the agent is behind the stone, these directions would be opposite. 

Let me revisit the problem statement to ensure I understand the preconditions correctly:

For the action "pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d", the preconditions are:
4. You can get from l_p to l_from following direction d
5. You can get from l_from to l_to following direction d

So, if the agent is at pos42 and the stone is at pos32, the direction d from the agent to the stone is "dirup". But from the stone to the target (pos22), it's also "dirup". This means the agent, stone, and target are in a straight line. If I want to push the stone in a different direction, I'd need to be in a different position.

This makes sense. If I want to push the stone from my position, I need to be in the direction where I want the stone to go, and then push in that direction. Following this, let me correct the plan:

Initial state:
- player1 is at pos24
- stone1 is at pos32

1. To push stone1 from pos32 to pos22, player1 needs to be at pos42 and then push the stone using the "dirup" direction.
   - Move player1 from pos24 to pos34 (down)
   - Move player1 from pos34 to pos44 (down)
   - Move player1 from pos44 to pos43 (left)
   - Move player1 from pos43 to pos42 (left)
   - PushToNonGoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos22 dirup
     - Now player1 is at pos32 and stone1 is at pos22

2. To satisfy constraint 1 (player1 at pos35 and stone1 at pos22), we need to move player1 from pos32 to pos35.
   - Move player1 from pos32 to pos33 (right)
   - Move player1 from pos33 to pos34 (right)
   - Move player1 from pos34 to pos35 (right)
     - Now player1 is at pos35 and stone1 is at pos22, satisfying constraint 1.

3. To satisfy constraint 3 and 4 (player1 at pos22 after pos21 is not clear), we first need to make pos21 not clear.
   - Move player1 from pos35 to pos25 (up)
   - Move player1 from pos25 to pos15 (up)
   - Move player1 from pos15 to pos14 (left)
   - Move player1 from pos14 to pos13 (left)
   - Move player1 from pos13 to pos12 (left)
   - Move player1 from pos12 to pos11 (left)
   - Move player1 from pos11 to pos21 (down)
     - Now pos21 is not clear because player1 is there.
   - Move player1 from pos21 to pos22 (right)
     - Now player1 is at pos22, satisfying constraint 3, and before that, pos21 was not clear, satisfying constraint 4.

4. Now, let's satisfy constraint 2 (stone1 at pos41 or pos45 not clear). We'll make pos45 not clear.
   - Move player1 from pos22 to pos23 (right)
   - Move player1 from pos23 to pos24 (right)
   - Move player1 from pos24 to pos25 (right)
   - Move player1 from pos25 to pos35 (down)
   - Move player1 from pos35 to pos45 (down)
     - Now pos45 is not clear because player1 is there, satisfying constraint 2.

5. Finally, let's push stone1 to the goal location pos53.
   - Move player1 from pos45 to pos35 (up)
   - Move player1 from pos35 to pos25 (up)
   - Move player1 from pos25 to pos24 (left)
   - Move player1 from pos24 to pos23 (left)
   - Move player1 from pos23 to pos13 (up)
   - Move player1 from pos13 to pos12 (left)
   - PushToNonGoal player1 stone1 pos12 pos22 pos32 dirdown
     - Now player1 is at pos22 and stone1 is at pos32.
   - Move player1 from pos22 to pos23 (right)
   - Move player1 from pos23 to pos33 (down)
   - PushToNonGoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos32 pos42 dirdown
     - Now player1 is at pos32 and stone1 is at pos42.
   - Move player1 from pos32 to pos33 (right)
   - Move player1 from pos33 to pos43 (down)
   - PushToNonGoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos42 pos52 dirdown
     - Now player1 is at pos42 and stone1 is at pos52.
   - Move player1 from pos42 to pos43 (right)
   - Move player1 from pos43 to pos53 (down)
   - PushToGoal player1 stone1 pos53 pos52 pos53 dirright
     - Now player1 is at pos52 and stone1 is at pos53 (a goal location), satisfying the main goal.

Hmm, I see I misunderstood the preconditions for the push actions. The direction d is used both for the agent to get to the stone and for the stone to move to the target. This means the agent, stone, and target are in a line, and the agent pushes the stone from behind.

Given this, let's replan our push actions.

Initial state:
- player1 is at pos24
- stone1 is at pos32

1. To move stone1 from pos32 to pos22, player1 needs to be at pos42 (behind the stone relative to the target). Then, pushing in the "dirup" direction will move the stone from pos32 to pos22.
   - Move player1 from pos24 to pos34 (down)
   - Move player1 from pos34 to pos44 (down)
   - Move player1 from pos44 to pos43 (left)
   - Move player1 from pos43 to pos42 (left)
   - PushToNonGoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos22 dirup
     - Now player1 is at pos32 and stone1 is at pos22.

2. To satisfy constraint 1 (player1 at pos35 and stone1 at pos22), we need to move player1 from pos32 to pos35.
   - Move player1 from pos32 to pos33 (right)
   - Move player1 from pos33 to pos34 (right)
   - Move player1 from pos34 to pos35 (right)
     - Now player1 is at pos35 and stone1 is at pos22, satisfying constraint 1.

3. To satisfy constraint 3 and 4 (player1 at pos22 after pos21 is not clear), we first need to make pos21 not clear.
   - Move player1 from pos35 to pos25 (up)
   - Move player1 from pos25 to pos15 (up)
   - Move player1 from pos15 to pos14 (left)
   - Move player1 from pos14 to pos13 (left)
   - Move player1 from pos13 to pos12 (left)
   - Move player1 from pos12 to pos11 (left)
   - Move player1 from pos11 to pos21 (down)
     - Now pos21 is not clear because player1 is there.
   - Move player1 from pos21 to pos22 (right)
     - Now player1 is at pos22, satisfying constraint 3, and before that, pos21 was not clear, satisfying constraint 4.

4. Now, let's satisfy constraint 2 (stone1 at pos41 or pos45 not clear). We'll make pos45 not clear.
   - Move player1 from pos22 to pos23 (right)
   - Move player1 from pos23 to pos24 (right)
   - Move player1 from pos24 to pos25 (right)
   - Move player1 from pos25 to pos35 (down)
   - Move player1 from pos35 to pos45 (down)
     - Now pos45 is not clear because player1 is there, satisfying constraint 2.

5. Finally, let's push stone1 to the goal location pos53.
   - Move player1 from pos45 to pos35 (up)
   - Move player1 from pos35 to pos25 (up)
   - Move player1 from pos25 to pos24 (left)
   - Move player1 from pos24 to pos23 (left)
   - Move player1 from pos23 to pos13 (up)
   - Move player1 from pos13 to pos12 (left)
   - PushToNonGoal player1 stone1 pos12 pos22 pos32 dirdown
     - Now player1 is at pos22 and stone1 is at pos32.
   - Move player1 from pos22 to pos23 (right)
   - Move player1 from pos23 to pos33 (down)
   - PushToNonGoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos32 pos42 dirdown
     - Now player1 is at pos32 and stone1 is at pos42.
   - Move player1 from pos32 to pos33 (right)
   - Move player1 from pos33 to pos43 (down)
   - PushToNonGoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos42 pos52 dirdown
     - Now player1 is at pos42 and stone1 is at pos52.
   - Move player1 from pos42 to pos43 (right)
   - Move player1 from pos43 to pos53 (down)
   - PushToGoal player1 stone1 pos53 pos52 pos53 dirright
     - Now player1 is at pos52 and stone1 is at pos53 (a goal location), satisfying the main goal.

Wait a moment, I misunderstood the preconditions for the push actions. The preconditions state:

4. You can get from l_p to l_from following direction d
5. You can get from l_from to l_to following direction d

This means that d should be a valid direction to move from the player's location to the stone's location, and also from the stone's location to the target location. This means the player, stone, and target must be in a straight line from each other.

But for example, you can get from "pos42" to "pos32" following "dirup", but you can't get from "pos32" to "pos22" following "dirup" since they're not in a straight line (unless the grid layout is different from what I imagined).

Let's check the adjacency relations from the problem statement again.

From the initial state of the world, we have:
"You may move from location pos42 to location pos32 following direction dirleft"
"You may move from location pos32 to location pos22 following direction dirleft"

this contradicts what I was imagining for the grid layout. Let me reconsider the directions.

Actually, when we look at all those "You may move..." statements, it seems like from the problem formulation the directions are:
- dirup: to move to a location with a lower row number
- dirdown: to move to a location with a higher row number
- dirleft: to move to a location with a lower column number
- dirright: to move to a location with a higher column number

And the grid positions pos11, pos12, etc. represent (row, column).

So, pos32 is at row 3, column 2.

But wait, I just realized I misinterpreted the problem statement all along. Let me check again:

"You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright"
This implies pos11 is to the left of pos21, so the first digit is the column and the second digit is the row.

So, pos32 is at column 3, row 2.

Given this, let's restate the initial positions:
- player1 is at pos24 (column 2, row 4)
- stone1 is at pos32 (column 3, row 2)
- goal location is pos53 (column 5, row 3)

Ok, I understand now. When the problem states:
"You may move from location pos42 to location pos32 following direction dirleft",
it's saying the agent can move from column 4, row 2 to column 3, row 2.

Given this, let's replan our push actions.

Initial state:
- player1 is at pos24 (column 2, row 4)
- stone1 is at pos32 (column 3, row 2)

Hmm, I think I'm getting confused by the naming. Let's say posxy is at column x, row y. Then, the initial state is:
- player1 is at pos24 (column 2, row 4)
- stone1 is at pos32 (column 3, row 2)

Let's validate this with some of the "You may move..." statements:
"You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright"
This means you can move from column 1, row 1 to column 2, row 1 by going right, which makes sense.

"You may move from location pos11 to location pos12 following direction dirdown"
This means you can move from column 1, row 1 to column 1, row 2 by going down, which makes sense.

"You may move from location pos21 to location pos22 following direction dirdown"
This means you can move from column 2, row 1 to column 2, row 2 by going down, which makes sense.

Ok, so my most recent interpretation is correct. Let's proceed with planning.
