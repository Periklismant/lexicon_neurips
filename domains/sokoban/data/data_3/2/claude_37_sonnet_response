Let me break down this problem:

1. We have a 2D 5x5 grid with positions labeled pos11 (top-left) to pos55 (bottom-right).
2. There's one agent (player1) and one stone (stone1).
3. The goal is to move the stone to a goal location, which is pos13.
4. The player starts at pos51 (bottom-left) and the stone starts at pos32.
5. We have three types of actions: move the player, push a stone to a goal, or push a stone to a non-goal location.

There are also constraints on the plan:
1. pos13 must not be clear in at least one state.
2. If pos13 is not clear, then pos44 or pos45 must also not be clear in that state or some state after it.
3. pos41 must not be clear in at least one state.
4. If pos41 is not clear, then in an earlier state, either player1 was at pos24 or pos35 was not clear.
5. pos11 must not be clear in at least one state.
6. If pos11 is not clear, then in an earlier state, either stone1 was at pos31 or pos52 was not clear.

Let's first think about the basic plan to solve the goal: We need to move the stone (currently at pos32) to a goal location (pos13).

To push the stone to the goal, the player must first get to a position adjacent to the stone. From the player's initial position at pos51, he'd need to move to pos41, pos42, or pos52. Then, the player needs to be on the opposite side of the stone from the direction in which they want to push it. 

Let's visualize the grid (where 1,1 is the top-left):
```
1,1 1,2 1,3 1,4 1,5
2,1 2,2 2,3 2,4 2,5
3,1 3,2 3,3 3,4 3,5
4,1 4,2 4,3 4,4 4,5
5,1 5,2 5,3 5,4 5,5
```

The shortest path for the stone might be pos32 -> pos31 -> pos21 -> pos11 -> pos12 -> pos13. Let's see if we can work out a plan for this.

First, we need to move the player from pos51 to be adjacent to the stone at pos32. Then we need to push the stone along the path to pos13.

Let me work on a plan:

Initial state:
- player1 at pos51
- stone1 at pos32

1. player1 moves from pos51 to pos41: `move player1 pos51 pos41 dirleft`
2. player1 moves from pos41 to pos31: `move player1 pos41 pos31 dirleft`
3. player1 moves from pos31 to pos32: `move player1 pos31 pos32 dirdown`

Now the player is at pos32 and the stone is at pos32, but wait, this is not possible since the stone is already at pos32. Let me rethink the path.

Actually, the player needs to be adjacent to the stone and on the opposite side of the direction they want to push. So if the stone is at pos32 and we want to push it left, the player should be at pos33. 

Let's adjust:

1. player1 moves from pos51 to pos41: `move player1 pos51 pos41 dirleft`
2. player1 moves from pos41 to pos42: `move player1 pos41 pos42 dirdown`
3. player1 moves from pos42 to pos43: `move player1 pos42 pos43 dirdown`
4. player1 moves from pos43 to pos33: `move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft`

Now the player is at pos33 and can push the stone from pos32 to pos31:

5. Player pushes stone from pos32 to pos31: `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos32 pos31 dirleft`

Now the player is at pos32, stone at pos31. Next, we need to move the player to push the stone from pos31 to pos21:

6. player1 moves from pos32 to pos31: `move player1 pos32 pos31 dirleft`
7. player1 moves from pos31 to pos41: `move player1 pos31 pos41 dirright`
8. player1 moves from pos41 to pos42: `move player1 pos41 pos42 dirdown`
9. player1 moves from pos42 to pos32: `move player1 pos42 pos32 dirleft`
10. player1 moves from pos32 to pos22: `move player1 pos32 pos22 dirleft`
11. player1 moves from pos22 to pos21: `move player1 pos22 pos21 dirup`
12. player1 moves from pos21 to pos11: `move player1 pos21 pos11 dirleft`
13. player1 moves from pos11 to pos12: `move player1 pos11 pos12 dirdown`
14. player1 moves from pos12 to pos22: `move player1 pos12 pos22 dirright`
15. player1 moves from pos22 to pos32: `move player1 pos22 pos32 dirright`
16. player1 moves from pos32 to pos31: `move player1 pos32 pos31 dirleft`

Wait, that is not right. Let me walk through this more carefully. I'm getting confused with the directions.

Let's simplify:

From the original state:
- player1 at pos51
- stone1 at pos32

To push stone1 from pos32 to pos31 following direction dirleft, the player should be at pos33.

1. player1 moves from pos51 to pos41: `move player1 pos51 pos41 dirleft`
2. player1 moves from pos41 to pos42: `move player1 pos41 pos42 dirdown`
3. player1 moves from pos42 to pos43: `move player1 pos42 pos43 dirdown`
4. player1 moves from pos43 to pos33: `move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft`
5. Player pushes stone from pos32 to pos31 (player moves to pos32): `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos32 pos31 dirleft`

Okay, now the player is at pos32 and the stone is at pos31. To push the stone from pos31 to pos21 following direction dirleft, the player should be at pos41.

6. player1 moves from pos32 to pos42: `move player1 pos32 pos42 dirright`
7. player1 moves from pos42 to pos41: `move player1 pos42 pos41 dirup`
8. Player pushes stone from pos31 to pos21 (player moves to pos31): `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos41 pos31 pos21 dirleft`

Now the player is at pos31 and the stone is at pos21. To push the stone from pos21 to pos11 following direction dirleft, the player should be at pos31 (already there).

9. Player pushes stone from pos21 to pos11 (player moves to pos21): `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos21 pos11 dirleft`

Now the player is at pos21 and the stone is at pos11. To push the stone from pos11 to pos12 following direction dirdown, the player should be at pos21 (already there).

10. Player pushes stone from pos11 to pos12 (player moves to pos11): `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos21 pos11 pos12 dirdown`

Now the player is at pos11 and the stone is at pos12. To push the stone from pos12 to pos13 following direction dirdown, the player should be at pos11 (already there).

11. Player pushes stone from pos12 to pos13 (player moves to pos12): `pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos11 pos12 pos13 dirdown`

This would be the basic plan to move the stone to the goal, but let's check if it meets the constraints:

1. pos13 must not be clear in at least one state.
   - This is satisfied in the final state where the stone is at pos13.

2. If pos13 is not clear, then pos44 or pos45 must also not be clear in that state or some state after it.
   - This is not satisfied yet. We need to ensure that pos44 or pos45 is not clear when pos13 is not clear.

3. pos41 must not be clear in at least one state.
   - This is satisfied in step 8 when the player is at pos41.

4. If pos41 is not clear, then in an earlier state, either player1 was at pos24 or pos35 was not clear.
   - This is not satisfied yet. We need to ensure that the player visits pos24 or makes pos35 not clear before step 8.

5. pos11 must not be clear in at least one state.
   - This is satisfied in step 9 when the stone is at pos11.

6. If pos11 is not clear, then in an earlier state, either stone1 was at pos31 or pos52 was not clear.
   - This is satisfied as the stone is at pos31 in step 8, which is earlier than step 9.

Now, let's adjust our plan to meet constraint 2 (If pos13 is not clear, then pos44 or pos45 must also not be clear in that state or some state after it) and constraint 4 (If pos41 is not clear, then in an earlier state, either player1 was at pos24 or pos35 was not clear).

For constraint 4, we need to ensure the player visits pos24 or makes pos35 not clear before step 8 (where pos41 becomes not clear).

Let's modify the plan:

From the original state:
- player1 at pos51
- stone1 at pos32

1. player1 moves from pos51 to pos52: `move player1 pos51 pos52 dirdown`
2. player1 moves from pos52 to pos53: `move player1 pos52 pos53 dirdown`
3. player1 moves from pos53 to pos54: `move player1 pos53 pos54 dirdown`
4. player1 moves from pos54 to pos44: `move player1 pos54 pos44 dirleft`
5. player1 moves from pos44 to pos34: `move player1 pos44 pos34 dirleft`
6. player1 moves from pos34 to pos24: `move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft` -- To satisfy constraint 4
7. player1 moves from pos24 to pos34: `move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright`
8. player1 moves from pos34 to pos33: `move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup`
9. Player pushes stone from pos32 to pos31 (player moves to pos32): `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos32 pos31 dirleft`
10. player1 moves from pos32 to pos42: `move player1 pos32 pos42 dirright`
11. player1 moves from pos42 to pos41: `move player1 pos42 pos41 dirup` -- pos41 is not clear, but it's okay because the player was at pos24 in step 6
12. Player pushes stone from pos31 to pos21 (player moves to pos31): `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos41 pos31 pos21 dirleft`
13. Player pushes stone from pos21 to pos11 (player moves to pos21): `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos21 pos11 dirleft`
14. Player pushes stone from pos11 to pos12 (player moves to pos11): `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos21 pos11 pos12 dirdown`

Now, for constraint 2, we need to ensure that pos44 or pos45 is not clear after or when pos13 is not clear:

15. Player pushes stone from pos12 to pos13 (player moves to pos12): `pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos11 pos12 pos13 dirdown` -- Now pos13 is not clear
16. player1 moves from pos12 to pos22: `move player1 pos12 pos22 dirright`
17. player1 moves from pos22 to pos32: `move player1 pos22 pos32 dirright`
18. player1 moves from pos32 to pos42: `move player1 pos32 pos42 dirright`
19. player1 moves from pos42 to pos43: `move player1 pos42 pos43 dirdown`
20. player1 moves from pos43 to pos44: `move player1 pos43 pos44 dirdown` -- Now pos44 is not clear, satisfying constraint 2

This should satisfy all the constraints. Let's double-check:

1. pos13 must not be clear in at least one state.
   - Satisfied in step 15 when the stone is at pos13.

2. If pos13 is not clear, then pos44 or pos45 must also not be clear in that state or some state after it.
   - Satisfied in step 20 when the player is at pos44, after pos13 becomes not clear in step 15.

3. pos41 must not be clear in at least one state.
   - Satisfied in step 11 when the player is at pos41.

4. If pos41 is not clear, then in an earlier state, either player1 was at pos24 or pos35 was not clear.
   - Satisfied as the player is at pos24 in step 6, which is earlier than step 11.

5. pos11 must not be clear in at least one state.
   - Satisfied in step 13 when the stone is at pos11.

6. If pos11 is not clear, then in an earlier state, either stone1 was at pos31 or pos52 was not clear.
   - Satisfied as the stone is at pos31 in step 12, which is earlier than step 13.

Actually, there's a potential issue with the timing of the action order. Specifically, I said that stone is at pos31 in step 12, which is before step 13 where pos11 is not clear. But in step 12, the stone is being pushed from pos31 to pos21, so the stone is not actually at pos31 after step 12.

Let me be more precise about the state of the game after each action to ensure we satisfy the constraints.

After action 12, stone1 is at pos21 and player is at pos31.
After action 9, stone1 is at pos31 and player is at pos32.

So the stone was at pos31 after action 9, which is before action 13, where pos11 is not clear.

Let's update the final plan:

```
move player1 pos51 pos52 dirdown
move player1 pos52 pos53 dirdown
move player1 pos53 pos54 dirdown
move player1 pos54 pos44 dirleft
move player1 pos44 pos34 dirleft
move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft
move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright
move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos32 pos31 dirleft
move player1 pos32 pos42 dirright
move player1 pos42 pos41 dirup
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos41 pos31 pos21 dirleft
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos21 pos11 dirleft
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos21 pos11 pos12 dirdown
pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos11 pos12 pos13 dirdown
move player1 pos12 pos22 dirright
move player1 pos22 pos32 dirright
move player1 pos32 pos42 dirright
move player1 pos42 pos43 dirdown
move player1 pos43 pos44 dirdown
```

Hmm, actually, there's something wrong with my reasoning before. In the action pushtogoal or pushtonongoal, the player doesn't stay at the same position; they end up at the position where the stone was. So after pushing the stone, the player and stone end up in different places. Let me re-adjust the plan.

From the original state:
- player1 at pos51
- stone1 at pos32

1. player1 moves from pos51 to pos52: `move player1 pos51 pos52 dirdown`
2. player1 moves from pos52 to pos53: `move player1 pos52 pos53 dirdown`
3. player1 moves from pos53 to pos54: `move player1 pos53 pos54 dirdown`
4. player1 moves from pos54 to pos44: `move player1 pos54 pos44 dirleft`
5. player1 moves from pos44 to pos34: `move player1 pos44 pos34 dirleft`
6. player1 moves from pos34 to pos24: `move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft` -- To satisfy constraint 4
7. player1 moves from pos24 to pos34: `move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright`
8. player1 moves from pos34 to pos33: `move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup`

Now player is at pos33 and stone is at pos32.

9. Player pushes stone from pos32 to pos31 (player moves to pos32): `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos32 pos31 dirleft`

Now player is at pos32 and stone is at pos31. To push the stone to pos21, the player needs to be at a position where they can push the stone from pos31 to pos21 following direction dirleft. This means the player needs to be at a position to the right of the stone, which is pos41.

10. player1 moves from pos32 to pos42: `move player1 pos32 pos42 dirright`
11. player1 moves from pos42 to pos41: `move player1 pos42 pos41 dirup` -- pos41 is not clear

Now player is at pos41 and stone is at pos31. Next, we push the stone from pos31 to pos21:

12. Player pushes stone from pos31 to pos21 (player moves to pos31): `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos41 pos31 pos21 dirleft`

Now player is at pos31 and stone is at pos21. To push stone from pos21 to pos11, the player needs to be to the right of the stone, which is pos31 (already there).

13. Player pushes stone from pos21 to pos11 (player moves to pos21): `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos21 pos11 dirleft`

Now player is at pos21 and stone is at pos11. To push stone from pos11 to pos12, the player needs to be above the stone, which is pos21 (already there).

14. Player pushes stone from pos11 to pos12 (player moves to pos11): `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos21 pos11 pos12 dirdown`

Now player is at pos11 and stone is at pos12. To push stone from pos12 to pos13, the player needs to be above the stone, which is pos11 (already there).

15. Player pushes stone from pos12 to pos13 (player moves to pos12): `pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos11 pos12 pos13 dirdown` -- Now pos13 is not clear and goal is achieved

Let's check if we satisfy constraint 2 (If pos13 is not clear, then pos44 or pos45 must also not be clear in that state or some state after it).

Wait, I missed that constraint. After step 15, pos13 is not clear (because the stone is there), but neither pos44 nor pos45 is not clear yet. We need to adjust the plan to ensure pos44 or pos45 is not clear after pos13 is not clear:

16. player1 moves from pos12 to pos22: `move player1 pos12 pos22 dirright`
17. player1 moves from pos22 to pos32: `move player1 pos22 pos32 dirright`
18. player1 moves from pos32 to pos42: `move player1 pos32 pos42 dirright`
19. player1 moves from pos42 to pos43: `move player1 pos42 pos43 dirdown`
20. player1 moves from pos43 to pos44: `move player1 pos43 pos44 dirdown` -- Now pos44 is not clear, satisfying constraint 2

Now, let's confirm that all constraints are satisfied:

1. pos13 must not be clear in at least one state.
   - Satisfied in step 15 when the stone is at pos13.

2. If pos13 is not clear, then pos44 or pos45 must also not be clear in that state or some state after it.
   - Satisfied in step 20 when the player is at pos44, after pos13 becomes not clear in step 15.

3. pos41 must not be clear in at least one state.
   - Satisfied in step 11 when the player is at pos41.

4. If pos41 is not clear, then in an earlier state, either player1 was at pos24 or pos35 was not clear.
   - Satisfied as the player is at pos24 in step 6, which is earlier than step 11.

5. pos11 must not be clear in at least one state.
   - Satisfied in step 13 when the stone is pushed to pos11 (and pos11 becomes not clear).

6. If pos11 is not clear, then in an earlier state, either stone1 was at pos31 or pos52 was not clear.
   - Satisfied as stone1 is at pos31 after step 9, which is earlier than step 13. Additionally, player is at pos52 in step 1, making pos52 not clear.

All constraints are satisfied. Here's the final plan:

```
move player1 pos51 pos52 dirdown
move player1 pos52 pos53 dirdown
move player1 pos53 pos54 dirdown
move player1 pos54 pos44 dirleft
move player1 pos44 pos34 dirleft
move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft
move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright
move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos32 pos31 dirleft
move player1 pos32 pos42 dirright
move player1 pos42 pos41 dirup
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos41 pos31 pos21 dirleft
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos21 pos11 dirleft
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos21 pos11 pos12 dirdown
pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos11 pos12 pos13 dirdown
move player1 pos12 pos22 dirright
move player1 pos22 pos32 dirright
move player1 pos32 pos42 dirright
move player1 pos42 pos43 dirdown
move player1 pos43 pos44 dirdown
```

Actually, let me double check the directions. I've been using the following definitions:
- dirup: Moving from a position with a higher number to a position with a lower number in the row direction.
- dirdown: Moving from a position with a lower number to a position with a higher number in the row direction.
- dirleft: Moving from a position with a higher number to a position with a lower number in the column direction.
- dirright: Moving from a position with a lower number to a position with a higher number in the column direction.

Let me check if this is consistent with the problem statement's directions:

From the original state: "You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright", so dirright is moving from a lower column to a higher column (from 1 to 2 in this case).

From the original state: "You may move from location pos11 to location pos12 following direction dirdown", so dirdown is moving from a lower row to a higher row (from 1 to 2 in this case).

From the original state: "You may move from location pos12 to location pos11 following direction dirup", so dirup is moving from a higher row to a lower row (from 2 to 1 in this case).

From the original state: "You may move from location pos21 to location pos11 following direction dirleft", so dirleft is moving from a higher column to a lower column (from 2 to 1 in this case).

So my understanding of the directions was correct. Let me revisit the plan and check if the directions are used correctly.

Actually, I think I'm making a mistake in how I've been reading the grid. I think it's defined as posRC where R is the row and C is the column. If pos11 is at the top-left, then the grid is indeed 5x5 with positions:

```
pos11 pos12 pos13 pos14 pos15
pos21 pos22 pos23 pos24 pos25
pos31 pos32 pos33 pos34 pos35
pos41 pos42 pos43 pos44 pos45
pos51 pos52 pos53 pos54 pos55
```

Given this, dirright moves in the positive column direction, dirleft moves in the negative column direction, dirdown moves in the positive row direction, and dirup moves in the negative row direction.

From the original state:
- player1 at pos51 (bottom-left)
- stone1 at pos32 (middle-middle-left)

1. player1 moves from pos51 to pos52: `move player1 pos51 pos52 dirright`
2. player1 moves from pos52 to pos53: `move player1 pos52 pos53 dirright`
3. player1 moves from pos53 to pos54: `move player1 pos53 pos54 dirright`
4. player1 moves from pos54 to pos44: `move player1 pos54 pos44 dirup`
5. player1 moves from pos44 to pos34: `move player1 pos44 pos34 dirup`
6. player1 moves from pos34 to pos24: `move player1 pos34 pos24 dirup` -- To satisfy constraint 4
7. player1 moves from pos24 to pos34: `move player1 pos24 pos34 dirdown`
8. player1 moves from pos34 to pos33: `move player1 pos34 pos33 dirleft`
9. Player pushes stone from pos32 to pos31 (player moves to pos32): `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos32 pos31 dirleft`
10. player1 moves from pos32 to pos42: `move player1 pos32 pos42 dirdown`
11. player1 moves from pos42 to pos41: `move player1 pos42 pos41 dirleft` -- pos41 is not clear
12. Player pushes stone from pos31 to pos21 (player moves to pos31): `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos41 pos31 pos21 dirup`
13. Player pushes stone from pos21 to pos11 (player moves to pos21): `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos21 pos11 dirup`
14. Player pushes stone from pos11 to pos12 (player moves to pos11): `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos21 pos11 pos12 dirright`
15. Player pushes stone from pos12 to pos13 (player moves to pos12): `pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos11 pos12 pos13 dirright` -- Now pos13 is not clear and goal is achieved
16. player1 moves from pos12 to pos22: `move player1 pos12 pos22 dirdown`
17. player1 moves from pos22 to pos32: `move player1 pos22 pos32 dirdown`
18. player1 moves from pos32 to pos42: `move player1 pos32 pos42 dirdown`
19. player1 moves from pos42 to pos43: `move player1 pos42 pos43 dirright`
20. player1 moves from pos43 to pos44: `move player1 pos43 pos44 dirright` -- Now pos44 is not clear, satisfying constraint 2

But there's something wrong. I accidentally flipped the interpretation of the direction again.

Let's use the information from the original state again:
- "You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright"
This means moving from pos11 to pos21 is moving right. But pos21 is below pos11 in the grid. So dirright means moving down in the grid.

Let's try again:
- "You may move from location pos11 to location pos12 following direction dirdown"
This means moving from pos11 to pos12 is moving down. But pos12 is to the right of pos11 in the grid. So dirdown means moving right in the grid.

This is getting confusing. Let me reconsider the grid:

The direction of movement given in the problem statement:
- "You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright"
- "You may move from location pos11 to location pos12 following direction dirdown"

The grid structure isn't directly stated, so I'll infer it based on the available information.

From the first statement, moving from pos11 to pos21 is moving right (dirright). This means that the first digit in posXY represents the column and the second digit represents the row. Then, the grid would be:

```
pos11 pos21 pos31 pos41 pos51
pos12 pos22 pos32 pos42 pos52
pos13 pos23 pos33 pos43 pos53
pos14 pos24 pos34 pos44 pos54
pos15 pos25 pos35 pos45 pos55
```

But from the second statement, moving from pos11 to pos12 is moving down (dirdown). This implies a different grid layout.

Let me double-check the problem statement for more clarity on the grid layout.

Let's look closely at other movement examples:
- "You may move from location pos12 to location pos22 following direction dirright"
- "You may move from location pos12 to location pos11 following direction dirup"
- "You may move from location pos12 to location pos13 following direction dirdown"

From the first and second examples, it's clear that pos11 is to the left and up from pos12, and pos22 is to the right of pos12.

Based on these, I'll assume the following grid layout:

```
pos11 pos21 pos31 pos41 pos51
pos12 pos22 pos32 pos42 pos52
pos13 pos23 pos33 pos43 pos53
pos14 pos24 pos34 pos44 pos54
pos15 pos25 pos35 pos45 pos55
```

This means:
- dirright: Moving in the positive first digit direction (e.g., pos11 to pos21)
- dirleft: Moving in the negative first digit direction (e.g., pos21 to pos11)
- dirdown: Moving in the positive second digit direction (e.g., pos11 to pos12)
- dirup: Moving in the negative second digit direction (e.g., pos12 to pos11)

But wait, that doesn't match with the example "You may move from location pos12 to location pos13 following direction dirdown". If pos13 is below pos12, then we're moving in the positive third digit, not the second. This suggests a different grid layout.

Let's try again:

```
pos11 pos12 pos13 pos14 pos15
pos21 pos22 pos23 pos24 pos25
pos31 pos32 pos33 pos34 pos35
pos41 pos42 pos43 pos44 pos45
pos51 pos52 pos53 pos54 pos55
```

Now:
- dirright: Moving in the positive second digit direction (e.g., pos11 to pos12)
- dirleft: Moving in the negative second digit direction (e.g., pos12 to pos11)
- dirdown: Moving in the positive first digit direction (e.g., pos11 to pos21)
- dirup: Moving in the negative first digit direction (e.g., pos21 to pos11)

Let's check:
- "You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright": Incorrect, pos21 is below pos11.
- "You may move from location pos11 to location pos12 following direction dirdown": Incorrect, pos12 is to the right of pos11.
- "You may move from location pos12 to location pos22 following direction dirright": Incorrect, pos22 is below pos12.
- "You may move from location pos12 to location pos11 following direction dirup": Incorrect, pos11 is to the left of pos12.
- "You may move from location pos12 to location pos13 following direction dirdown": Incorrect, pos13 is to the right of pos12.

Ok, so we still have inconsistency, I think we're misinterpreting something else.

Let me try from scratch again. Using the information:
- "You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright" - Implies that the column (first digit) increases when moving right.
- "You may move from location pos11 to location pos12 following direction dirdown" - Implies that the row (second digit) increases when moving down.

Combining these, the grid layout would be (where the first digit is the row and the second digit is the column):

```
pos11 pos12 pos13 pos14 pos15
pos21 pos22 pos23 pos24 pos25
pos31 pos32 pos33 pos34 pos35
pos41 pos42 pos43 pos44 pos45
pos51 pos52 pos53 pos54 pos55
```

And the directions would be:
- dirright: Moving in the positive column (second digit) direction (e.g., pos11 to pos12)
- dirleft: Moving in the negative column (second digit) direction (e.g., pos12 to pos11)
- dirdown: Moving in the positive row (first digit) direction (e.g., pos11 to pos21)
- dirup: Moving in the negative row (first digit) direction (e.g., pos21 to pos11)

Let's check:
- "You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright": Incorrect, pos21 is below pos11, so we'd use dirdown.
- "You may move from location pos11 to location pos12 following direction dirdown": Incorrect, pos12 is to the right of pos11, so we'd use dirright.
- "You may move from location pos12 to location pos22 following direction dirright": Incorrect, pos22 is below pos12, so we'd use dirdown.
- "You may move from location pos12 to location pos11 following direction dirup": Incorrect, pos11 is to the left of pos12, so we'd use dirleft.
- "You may move from location pos12 to location pos13 following direction dirdown": Incorrect, pos13 is to the right of pos12, so we'd use dirright.

Oh dear, something is still not adding up! Maybe I misunderstand the problem statement.

Let me re-read the statements one more time:
- "You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright" - If pos21 is to the right of pos11, then the first digit is the column and the second digit is the row. But that contradicts the next statement.
- "You may move from location pos11 to location pos12 following direction dirdown" - If pos12 is below pos11, then the first digit is the row and the second digit is the column. But that contradicts the previous statement.

Let's take a step back and see if I can make sense of the directionality based on the adjacency information in the original state:

"You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright"
"You may move from location pos11 to location pos12 following direction dirdown"

This would make sense if:
1. The grid is in-fact laid out such that the first digit represents the row and the second represents the column.
2. dirright means increasing the row (moving down in the grid).
3. dirdown means increasing the column (moving right in the grid).

Similarly:
4. dirleft would mean decreasing the row (moving up in the grid).
5. dirup would mean decreasing the column (moving left in the grid).

With this interpretation:
- Going from pos11 to pos21 is moving "right" (in the problem's context), which is going from the first row to the second row.
- Going from pos11 to pos12 is moving "down" (in the problem's context), which is going from the first column to the second column.

Now with this understanding, let's verify the original state:
"You may move from location pos12 to location pos22 following direction dirright" - Yes, shifting from the first row to the second. ✓
"You may move from location pos12 to location pos11 following direction dirup" - Yes, shifting from the second column to the first. ✓
"You may move from location pos12 to location pos13 following direction dirdown" - Yes, shifting from the second column to the third. ✓

So, I'll use the following grid and movement directions:
```
pos11 pos12 pos13 pos14 pos15
pos21 pos22 pos23 pos24 pos25
pos31 pos32 pos33 pos34 pos35
pos41 pos42 pos43 pos44 pos45
pos51 pos52 pos53 pos54 pos55
```

- dirright: Moving down (increasing the first coordinate).
- dirleft: Moving up (decreasing the first coordinate).
- dirdown: Moving right (increasing the second coordinate).
- dirup: Moving left (decreasing the second coordinate).

Alright, now that we have this sorted, let's determine the plan.

From the original state:
- player1 at pos51 (bottom-left)
- stone1 at pos32 (middle row, second column from the left)

1. player1 moves from pos51 to pos52: `move player1 pos51 pos52 dirdown`
2. player1 moves from pos52 to pos53: `move player1 pos52 pos53 dirdown`
3. player1 moves from pos53 to pos54: `move player1 pos53 pos54 dirdown`
4. player1 moves from pos54 to pos44: `move player1 pos54 pos44 dirleft`
5. player1 moves from pos44 to pos34: `move player1 pos44 pos34 dirleft`
6. player1 moves from pos34 to pos24: `move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft` -- To satisfy constraint 4
7. player1 moves from pos24 to pos34: `move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright`
8. player1 moves from pos34 to pos33: `move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup`
9. Player pushes stone from pos32 to pos31 (player moves to pos32): `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos32 pos31 dirup`
10. player1 moves from pos32 to pos42: `move player1 pos32 pos42 dirright`
11. player1 moves from pos42 to pos41: `move player1 pos42 pos41 dirup` -- pos41 is not clear
12. Player pushes stone from pos31 to pos21 (player moves to pos31): `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos41 pos31 pos21 dirleft`
13. Player pushes stone from pos21 to pos11 (player moves to pos21): `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos21 pos11 dirleft`
14. Player pushes stone from pos11 to pos12 (player moves to pos11): `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos21 pos11 pos12 dirdown`
15. Player pushes stone from pos12 to pos13 (player moves to pos12): `pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos11 pos12 pos13 dirdown` -- Now pos13 is not clear and goal is achieved
16. player1 moves from pos12 to pos22: `move player1 pos12 pos22 dirright`
17. player1 moves from pos22 to pos32: `move player1 pos22 pos32 dirright`
18. player1 moves from pos32 to pos42: `move player1 pos32 pos42 dirright`
19. player1 moves from pos42 to pos43: `move player1 pos42 pos43 dirdown`
20. player1 moves from pos43 to pos44: `move player1 pos43 pos44 dirdown` -- Now pos44 is not clear, satisfying constraint 2

Now, let's verify that all constraints are satisfied:

1. pos13 must not be clear in at least one state.
   - Satisfied in step 15 when the stone is at pos13.

2. If pos13 is not clear, then pos44 or pos45 must also not be clear in that state or some state after it.
   - Satisfied in step 20 when the player is at pos44, after pos13 becomes not clear in step 15.

3. pos41 must not be clear in at least one state.
   - Satisfied in step 11 when the player is at pos41.

4. If pos41 is not clear, then in an earlier state, either player1 was at pos24 or pos35 was not clear.
   - Satisfied as the player is at pos24 in step 6, which is earlier than step 11.

5. pos11 must not be clear in at least one state.
   - Satisfied in step 13 when the stone is pushed to pos11 (and pos11 becomes not clear).

6. If pos11 is not clear, then in an earlier state, either stone1 was at pos31 or pos52 was not clear.
   - Satisfied as stone1 is at pos31 after step 9, which is earlier than step 13. Additionally, player is at pos52 in step 1, making pos52 not clear.

All constraints are satisfied. Here's the final plan with the corrected directions:

```
move player1 pos51 pos52 dirdown
move player1 pos52 pos53 dirdown
move player1 pos53 pos54 dirdown
move player1 pos54 pos44 dirleft
move player1 pos44 pos34 dirleft
move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft
move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright
move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos32 pos31 dirup
move player1 pos32 pos42 dirright
move player1 pos42 pos41 dirup
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos41 pos31 pos21 dirleft
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos21 pos11 dirleft
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos21 pos11 pos12 dirdown
pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos11 pos12 pos13 dirdown
move player1 pos12 pos22 dirright
move player1 pos22 pos32 dirright
move player1 pos32 pos42 dirright
move player1 pos42 pos43 dirdown
move player1 pos43 pos44 dirdown
```

Now, when I review each step, I find that all the movements make sense given the grid layout and the movement rules I've established.

By "movement rules", I'm explicitly referring to the conclusions I reached:
```
dirright: Moving down (increasing the first coordinate).
dirleft: Moving up (decreasing the first coordinate).
dirdown: Moving right (increasing the second coordinate).
dirup: Moving left (decreasing the second coordinate).
```

It's counter-intuitive, but it seems to be consistent with the problem statement.

Ok, but let me check once more. I found an issue. Let's look at the move:

"You may move from location pos14 to location pos24 following direction dirright"

This implies that we go from pos14 to pos24 following dirright. 

With our intrepretation, dirright is "increasing the first coordinate". Going from 14 to 24 is indeed increasing from 1 to 2 on the first coordinate. This is consistent. 

"You may move from location pos24 to location pos14 following direction dirleft"

With dirLeft being "decreasing the first coordinate", this is consistent.

Let's check three more:

"You may move from location pos24 to location pos23 following direction dirup"

Going from pos24 to pos23 means we're going from the fourth column to the third column, which indeed involves decreasing the second coordinate, which is what dirup represents according to our interpretation.

"You may move from location pos24 to location pos25 following direction dirdown"

Going from pos24 to pos25 means going from the fourth column to the fifth column, which involves increasing the second coordinate, which is what dirdown represents.

"You may move from location pos13 to location pos14 following direction dirdown"

Going from pos13 to pos14 means going from column 3 to column 4, which increases the second coordinate. This is consistent with dirdown.

Ok, so our rules seem to check out. Let's recap the plan one last time:

```
move player1 pos51 pos52 dirdown
move player1 pos52 pos53 dirdown
move player1 pos53 pos54 dirdown
move player1 pos54 pos44 dirleft
move player1 pos44 pos34 dirleft
move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft
move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright
move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos32 pos31 dirup
move player1 pos32 pos42 dirright
move player1 pos42 pos41 dirup
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos41 pos31 pos21 dirleft
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos21 pos11 dirleft
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos21 pos11 pos12 dirdown
pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos11 pos12 pos13 dirdown
move player1 pos12 pos22 dirright
move player1 pos22 pos32 dirright
move player1 pos32 pos42 dirright
move player1 pos42 pos43 dirdown
move player1 pos43 pos44 dirdown
```
