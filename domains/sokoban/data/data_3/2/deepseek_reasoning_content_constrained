Okay, let's see. I need to create a plan that moves stone1 to a goal location. The only goal location mentioned is pos13. So the final state should have stone1 at pos13. But there are also several constraints that need to be satisfied during the plan.

First, let's outline the initial state. The agent (player1) is at pos51. Stone1 is at pos32. The goal is pos13, which is a goal location. The constraints are a bit complex. Let's list them:

1. At some state, pos13 must not be clear. That probably means the stone is there, which is our goal, so that's covered once we push stone1 to pos13.
2. If pos13 is not clear in a state, then either pos44 or pos45 must not be clear in that state or later. But since pos13 is the goal, once we place the stone there, maybe we need to have something in pos44 or pos45 afterwards. Hmm.
3. At some state, pos41 must not be clear. So the agent or a stone must be there.
4. If pos41 is not clear, then earlier there must be either player1 at pos24 or pos35 not clear.
5. At some state, pos11 must not be clear. So agent or stone there.
6. If pos11 is not clear, then earlier either stone1 was at pos31 or pos52 not clear.

So the plan needs to satisfy all these constraints while moving stone1 to pos13. Let's think about how to approach this.

First, the main goal is to push stone1 from pos32 to pos13. Let's see the path. pos32 is in row 3, column 2. pos13 is row 1, column 3. So we need to move the stone up from pos32 to pos22 (since moving up from pos32 would go to pos22? Wait, directions: dirup, dirdown, dirleft, dirright. Wait the movement directions need to be checked. Let me check the possible moves from each location.

Looking at the movement possibilities, for example, from pos32, you can move to pos22 (dirleft?), wait no. Let me check the "You may move from" statements. For pos32, the possible moves are:

- You may move from location pos32 to location pos22 following direction dirleft. Wait, no. Let me check: "You may move from location pos32 to location pos22 following direction dirleft" — no, looking at the list, the entry is: "You may move from location pos32 to location pos22 following direction dirleft"? Wait, let's check. The given movements include:

Looking for pos32:

- "You may move from location pos32 to location pos22 following direction dirleft" — yes, that's correct. Because pos32 is row3, column2. pos22 is row2, column2. So moving up (dirup) would be to pos22? Wait, the direction names might be a bit confusing. Let me check the direction for moving from pos32 to pos22.

Wait, the movement from pos22 to pos32 is dirright. So maybe directions are relative. For example, moving from pos22 to pos32 is dirright (east), which implies that pos32 is to the right of pos22. Therefore, moving from pos32 to pos22 would be dirleft (west). So that makes sense.

So the path for stone1 from pos32 to pos13 would involve moving up and left. Let's see:

Stone1 is at pos32. To get to pos13, which is up two rows (from row3 to row1) and left a column (from column2 to column3? Wait, pos13 is row1, column3. Wait, pos32 is row3, column2. So moving from pos32 to pos22 (dirleft?), then pos22 to pos23 (dirdown?), then pos23 to pos13 (dirleft)? Hmm, maybe not. Let me think in terms of coordinates.

Assuming the grid is numbered such that pos11 is row1, column1; pos12 is row1, column2; pos13 is row1, column3; pos21 is row2, column1, etc. So moving down increases the row number. So from pos32 (row3, column2), moving up would decrease the row to row2, same column: pos22. Then from pos22, moving up to pos12 (row1, column2). Then from pos12, moving right (dirright) to pos13. Wait, but pos12 to pos13 is direction dirdown? Wait no, the movement from pos12 to pos13 is direction dirdown according to the given moves. Wait, looking at the movement list:

"You may move from location pos12 to location pos13 following direction dirdown". So moving from pos12 to pos13 is down direction. That's a bit counterintuitive. So directions might be based on movement keys, like in some grid games where pressing down moves the character down the grid (increasing row number). So pos12 is row1, column2. pos13 is row1, column3. So moving from pos12 to pos13 would be to the right (east), but the direction is called dirdown. That's confusing. Alternatively, maybe directions are named based on the movement direction on the grid. For example, moving from pos12 to pos13 is moving east (right), but the direction is called dirdown. That's possible. Wait, but then how are the directions defined? Let me check some other movements.

For example, moving from pos11 to pos21 is direction dirright. pos11 is row1, column1. pos21 is row2, column1. So moving down (south) to pos21 is dirright. That's odd. So maybe the directions are named differently. Alternatively, perhaps the directions are misnamed. This could complicate the planning.

Alternatively, maybe the directions are relative to the grid in a different way. Let's check another movement. From pos11 to pos12 is dirdown. pos11 is row1, column1; pos12 is row1, column2. So moving east (right) is called dirdown. That's strange. Then, moving from pos12 to pos22 is dirright. pos12 is row1, column2; pos22 is row2, column2. So moving south is dirright. So dirright is moving south, dirdown is moving east. That's a bit confusing, but perhaps the direction names are arbitrary. So for the purpose of the problem, the directions are just labels, and the movement connections are given as per the problem's description. So I need to rely on the given movement connections rather than the direction names' intuitive meanings.

So, for example, to move from pos32 to pos22, the direction is dirleft. Then from pos22 to pos23 is dirdown (which, in this case, perhaps moves east to pos23). Wait, pos22 is row2, column2. pos23 is row2, column3. So moving east would be to pos23. But according to the movement list, "You may move from location pos22 to location pos23 following direction dirdown". So direction dirdown here corresponds to moving east. So directions are not the typical cardinal directions. So in this problem, directions are just labels, and the actual movement is determined by the given allowed transitions.

So to plan the path for the stone from pos32 to pos13, I need to find a path where the agent can push the stone through the allowed movements. Let's see.

Stone is at pos32. The agent needs to get to a position adjacent to the stone (l_p) such that the agent can push the stone towards the goal. Let's consider the possible moves for the stone.

To push the stone from pos32 to pos22 (since pos22 is a non-goal, but then maybe push again to pos23, etc. Wait, but the goal is pos13. So perhaps the agent can push the stone upwards (dirleft from pos32 to pos22), then from pos22 to pos23 (dirdown), then from pos23 to pos13 (dirleft). Wait, but let's check the allowed movements.

From pos22, the stone can be pushed to pos23 via dirdown (since "You may move from location pos22 to pos23 following dirdown"). Then from pos23, can the stone be pushed to pos13? Let's see: from pos23, can we move to pos13? According to the movement list, "You may move from location pos13 to location pos23 following direction dirright". So the reverse direction (from pos23 to pos13) would be dirleft? Because moving from pos13 to pos23 is dirright, so the opposite direction would be dirleft. But the movement list for pos23 includes "You may move from location pos23 to location pos13 following direction dirleft". Yes: "You may move from location pos23 to location pos13 following direction dirleft". So yes, from pos23, dirleft moves to pos13.

So to push the stone from pos23 to pos13, the agent would need to be at pos23's adjacent location in the opposite direction. Wait, the pushtogoal action requires the agent to be at l_p, which is adjacent to l_from (stone's current position) in direction d. Then the stone moves from l_from to l_to, which is in direction d from l_from.

Wait, the action "pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d" requires that the agent is at l_p, which is in direction d from l_from. Wait, no: the precondition (iv) says "you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d". Wait, that's different. So the agent is at l_p, and l_p is connected to l_from via direction d. So the agent is moving from l_p to l_from (the stone's current position) via direction d. Then, the stone is pushed from l_from to l_to in direction d. So for example, if the stone is at l_from, and the agent is at l_p, and there's a path from l_p to l_from via direction d, then the agent can push the stone from l_from to l_to (in direction d from l_from), provided l_to is clear and a goal location.

Wait, the preconditions for pushtogoal are:

(i) agent p is at l_p

(ii) stone s is at l_from

(iii) l_to is clear

(iv) you can get from l_p to l_from following direction d. So l_p is connected via direction d to l_from.

(v) you can get from l_from to l_to following direction d. So l_from is connected via direction d to l_to.

(vi) l_to is a goal location.

So, in order to push the stone from l_from to l_to (which must be a goal location), the agent must be at l_p, which is reachable from l_from via the reverse direction of d. Wait, no: if the agent is moving from l_p to l_from via direction d, then l_p is in the direction opposite to d from l_from. For example, if the stone is at l_from, and the agent is at l_p, and the direction from l_p to l_from is d, then to push the stone in direction d from l_from to l_to, the agent moves into l_from, pushing the stone to l_to.

So, for example, if the stone is at pos32, and the agent is at pos42 (south of pos32), then direction from pos42 to pos32 is dirup. So the agent can push the stone north (dirup) from pos32 to pos22. Wait, but pos32 to pos22 is direction dirleft according to the movement list. Hmm, this is getting confusing.

Alternatively, maybe the direction d in the action refers to the direction the agent is moving towards the stone. For example, if the agent is at pos42 (which is south of pos32), and the direction from pos42 to pos32 is dirup, then the agent can push the stone north (dirup) to pos22. But according to the movement list, moving from pos32 to pos22 is dirleft. So perhaps the direction in the action is the direction the agent moves towards the stone, not the direction the stone is moving. Let me think.

In the action "pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d", the direction d is the direction from l_p to l_from (the agent's path to reach the stone). Then, the stone is pushed in the same direction d from l_from to l_to. Wait, no: the stone is pushed from l_from to l_to following direction d. So, for the stone to move from l_from to l_to, that movement must be allowed by the direction d. So, the direction d must be a valid direction from l_from to l_to.

So for example, if the stone is at pos32, and the agent is at pos42 (south of pos32), then the direction from pos42 to pos32 is dirup (since moving from pos42 to pos32 is allowed via direction dirup). Then, the stone can be pushed from pos32 to pos22 (if that's a valid direction d from l_from to l_to). Wait, the movement from pos32 to pos22 is allowed via direction dirleft. So in that case, if the agent is at pos42, and the stone is at pos32, then to push the stone north to pos22, the direction d would have to be dirup (the direction the agent moves from pos42 to pos32), but the stone's movement from pos32 to pos22 requires direction dirleft. So this would not satisfy condition (v), since the stone's movement from l_from (pos32) to l_to (pos22) must be allowed via direction d. But in this case, the direction from l_from (pos32) to l_to (pos22) is dirleft. So for the action to be valid, d must be dirleft. But the agent is at pos42, which is south of pos32. So moving from pos42 to pos32 is direction dirup. So the agent can't use direction dirleft to get from pos42 to pos32. Therefore, the agent can't push the stone from pos32 to pos22 while being at pos42.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let's try to map out possible paths.

The stone is at pos32. The goal is pos13. The agent starts at pos51. So the agent needs to navigate to a position where they can push the stone towards the goal.

First, the agent needs to move from pos51 to pos32's vicinity. Let's see the movement options. From pos51, they can move to pos41 (dirleft) or pos52 (dirdown). Let's see:

pos51 → pos41 (dirleft). Then pos41 can move to pos31 (dirleft) or pos51 (dirright) or pos42 (dirdown). To get to pos32, the agent needs to go via pos42?

Wait, pos41 → pos42 (dirdown). Then pos42 can move to pos32 (dirleft), pos52 (dirright), pos41 (dirup), or pos43 (dirdown). So from pos42, the agent can move to pos32 via dirleft. So the path could be pos51 → pos41 (dirleft), pos41 → pos42 (dirdown), pos42 → pos32 (dirleft). But wait, the stone is at pos32, so the agent can't move there unless it's clear. But initially, pos32 is clear (since in the initial state, "Location pos32 is clear" is true. Wait, no: the initial state says "stone1 is at location pos32", so pos32 is not clear. Therefore, the agent cannot move into pos32. So the agent must approach pos32 from an adjacent cell and push the stone.

So the agent needs to get to a position adjacent to pos32 from which they can push the stone. The adjacent positions to pos32 are pos22 (up), pos31 (left), pos42 (down), and pos33 (right). Let's check which of these are accessible.

From pos51, the agent can go to pos41, then to pos42, then to pos32 (but pos32 is occupied by the stone). So the agent can reach pos42, which is adjacent to pos32 (down direction). From pos42, the agent can push the stone up (dirup) to pos22? Wait, no. Because to push the stone, the agent must be at a position l_p such that they can move to l_from (pos32) via direction d. So l_p must be connected to pos32 via direction d. For example, if the agent is at pos42 (south of pos32), the direction from pos42 to pos32 is dirup. Then, pushing the stone from pos32 to pos22 would require that pos32 to pos22 is allowed via direction d (dirup?), but according to the movement list, pos32 to pos22 is allowed via dirleft. So that doesn't match. Therefore, this approach won't work.

Alternatively, if the agent is at pos31 (west of pos32), then the direction from pos31 to pos32 is dirdown. Then, pushing the stone from pos32 to pos33 (east) would require that pos32 to pos33 is allowed via direction dirdown. Let's check the movement list: "You may move from location pos32 to location pos33 following direction dirdown". Yes. So if the agent is at pos31, they can push the stone from pos32 to pos33 via direction dirdown. But pos33 is not a goal location. So that would require using pushtonongoal. But the goal is to get the stone to pos13, which is a goal location. So pushing east to pos33 isn't helpful unless we can then push it north.

Alternatively, if the agent is at pos22 (north of pos32), then the direction from pos22 to pos32 is dirright (since "You may move from pos22 to pos32 following direction dirright"). So the agent could push the stone from pos32 to pos42 (south) via direction dirright? Wait, no. The direction from l_p (pos22) to l_from (pos32) is dirright. Then the stone is pushed from pos32 to l_to in direction dirright. So pos32's direction dirright is pos33? Because "You may move from pos32 to pos33 following direction dirdown". Wait, this is confusing. Let's clarify:

The movement from pos32 to pos33 is via dirdown. So if the agent is at pos22 and pushes the stone in direction dirright (the same direction they came from pos22 to pos32), then the stone would move in direction dirright from pos32. But according to the movement list, pos32's dirright is pos42 (since "You may move from location pos32 to location pos42 following direction dirright" — no, wait: looking back, the movement list says:

"You may move from location pos32 to location pos22 following direction dirleft"

"You may move from location pos32 to location pos42 following direction dirright"

"You may move from location pos32 to location pos31 following direction dirup"

"You may move from location pos32 to location pos33 following direction dirdown"

So, directions from pos32:

- dirleft: pos22

- dirright: pos42

- dirup: pos31

- dirdown: pos33

So if the agent is at pos22 and wants to push the stone from pos32, the direction from pos22 to pos32 is dirright (since moving from pos22 to pos32 is dirright). So in the action, d would be dirright. Then, pushing the stone from pos32 in direction dirright would send it to pos42. But pos42 is not a goal location. So that's a possible move, but not helpful for the goal.

Alternatively, if the agent is at pos31 (west of pos32), direction from pos31 to pos32 is dirdown (since "You may move from pos31 to pos32 following direction dirdown"). So d is dirdown. Then pushing the stone from pos32 in direction dirdown would move it to pos33. Again, not helpful for the goal.

Alternatively, the agent could approach from pos33 (east of pos32), direction from pos33 to pos32 is dirup. Then pushing the stone west (dirup) to pos32? No, that's not helpful. Wait, maybe the agent needs to approach from the north (pos22) to push the stone south (dirright to pos42), but that's not towards the goal.

Alternatively, perhaps the agent needs to navigate around to the west side of the stone. Let's see. The agent starts at pos51. Path to pos31:

pos51 → pos41 (dirleft)

pos41 → pos31 (dirleft)

From pos31, can the agent push the stone west? No, because the stone is at pos32. The agent is at pos31, which is west of pos32. So direction from pos31 to pos32 is dirdown. So pushing the stone from pos32 to pos33 (east) using dirdown direction. But pos33 is not a goal. Alternatively, the agent could push the stone north. Wait, but to push north, the agent would need to be south of the stone. Let's think differently.

The stone needs to go to pos13. Let's plan the path for the stone: pos32 → pos22 → pos23 → pos13. Each push needs to be towards the goal. Let's see:

First, push stone1 from pos32 to pos22. To do that, the agent needs to be at pos32's south (pos42) and push north. Wait, pos32's south is pos42. So agent moves to pos42, then pushes the stone north to pos22. But pos22 is not a goal location, so we need to use pushtonongoal. Then, from pos22, push the stone to pos23 (dirdown direction?), then from pos23 to pos13 (dirleft).

So let's break it down step by step.

1. Agent moves from pos51 to pos41 (dirleft), then to pos42 (dirdown), then to pos32 (dirleft) — but pos32 is occupied by the stone, so agent can't move there. So instead, agent must push the stone from pos32 while being at pos42. Wait, but to push the stone north from pos32 to pos22, the agent must be south of the stone (pos42), and the direction from pos42 to pos32 is dirup. Then, pushing the stone from pos32 to pos22 would require that pos32 to pos22 is allowed via direction dirup. But according to the movement list, pos32 to pos22 is allowed via dirleft. So that's not possible. Therefore, this approach won't work.

Hmm, this is tricky. Maybe the agent needs to approach from the east side. Let's see. To push the stone west from pos32 to pos22, the agent needs to be east of pos32 (pos33), and move west (dirleft) into pos32, pushing it to pos22. But pos33 is clear initially. So agent can move to pos33 via:

pos51 → pos41 (dirleft)

pos41 → pos42 (dirdown)

pos42 → pos43 (dirdown)

pos43 → pos33 (dirleft)

But pos33 is clear. So agent can move there. Then from pos33, they can push the stone west to pos32 → pos22? No, because the stone is already at pos32. Wait, no. If the agent is at pos33, to push the stone west, they would need to be east of the stone, but the stone is at pos32. So the agent can't reach pos33 if the stone is at pos32. Wait, the stone is at pos32 initially. So the agent can't move into pos32. So to get to pos33, the agent must go around.

Alternative path: pos51 → pos52 (dirdown), pos52 → pos53 (dirdown), pos53 → pos43 (dirleft), pos43 → pos33 (dirleft). Then from pos33, the agent can push the stone west to pos32 → pos22? No, because pos33 is east of pos32. So pushing west would move the stone from pos32 to pos22? Wait, no. From pos33, the direction to pos32 is dirleft. So the agent is at pos33, direction dirleft to pos32. Then, the stone is at pos32. So the agent can push the stone from pos32 to pos22 (since direction from pos32 to pos22 is dirleft). So the action would be pushtonongoal (since pos22 is not a goal) with direction dirleft.

Wait, let's check:

Preconditions for pushtonongoal:

- agent p is at l_p (pos33)

- stone s is at l_from (pos32)

- l_to (pos22) is clear. Initially, pos22 is clear.

- can move from l_p (pos33) to l_from (pos32) via direction d. So direction from pos33 to pos32 is dirleft. Is that allowed? Checking the movement list for pos33: "You may move from location pos33 to location pos32 following direction dirup". Wait, no. Looking at the movement list:

Looking for pos33 movements:

"You may move from location pos33 to location pos23 following direction dirleft"

"You may move from location pos33 to location pos43 following direction dirright"

"You may move from location pos33 to location pos32 following direction dirup"

"You may move from location pos33 to location pos34 following direction dirdown"

So from pos33 to pos32 is dirup. So direction d would be dirup. Then, the stone is pushed from pos32 to l_to in direction dirup. But pos32's dirup is pos22. Wait, no: the movement from pos32 to pos22 is via dirleft. Wait, no. The movement from pos32 to pos22 is dirleft. So how does that work?

This is getting really confusing. Let me try to re-express the movement directions for pos32:

- From pos32, you can go to pos22 via dirleft.

- To pos42 via dirright.

- To pos31 via dirup.

- To pos33 via dirdown.

So if the agent is at pos33 (south-east of pos32?), then moving from pos33 to pos32 is via dirup. So direction d is dirup. Then, pushing the stone from pos32 in direction dirup would be to pos22. Because pos32's dirup is pos22? Wait, no. pos32's dirup is pos31. Because from pos32, dirup is to pos31. Because the movement from pos32 to pos31 is via dirup: "You may move from location pos32 to location pos31 following direction dirup".

Wait, that's conflicting with earlier thoughts. Let me check:

The movement list includes:

"You may move from location pos32 to location pos31 following direction dirup"

"You may move from location pos32 to location pos22 following direction dirleft"

"You may move from location pos32 to location pos42 following direction dirright"

"You may move from location pos32 to location pos33 following direction dirdown"

So, from pos32:

- dirup → pos31 (north-west?)

- dirleft → pos22 (west?)

- dirright → pos42 (east?)

- dirdown → pos33 (south?)

So directions are not aligned with standard cardinal directions. So pos32's dirup is pos31, which is row3, column1. Wait, pos31 is row3, column1? Or is it row3, column1? Wait, the locations are named posXY, where X is the row and Y is the column. So pos31 is row3, column1; pos32 is row3, column2; pos22 is row2, column2.

So, from pos32 (row3, column2), moving dirup takes you to pos31 (row3, column1). So dirup is west? That's possible. Then dirleft from pos32 would be north to pos22 (row2, column2). So direction dirleft is north. Dirright is south to pos42 (row4, column2). Dirdown is east to pos33 (row3, column3). Wait, that's possible. So the directions are named in a way that dirup is west, dirleft is north, dirright is south, dirdown is east. That's a bit unconventional, but it's how the problem defines them.

So, with that in mind, to push the stone from pos32 to pos22 (row2, column2), the agent needs to be at a position from which they can move to pos32 via direction dirleft (since pushing in dirleft would move the stone north to pos22). Wait, no. Because the agent's direction to reach the stone is dirleft. Then the stone is pushed in the same direction dirleft from pos32. But according to the movement from pos32, dirleft is to pos22. So that would work.

So to perform a pushtonongoal action to move the stone from pos32 to pos22, the agent needs to be at a location l_p that can reach pos32 via direction dirleft. The allowed movement from l_p to pos32 via dirleft. Which locations can reach pos32 via dirleft?

Looking at the movement list, any location that can move to pos32 via dirleft. For example, pos42 can move to pos32 via dirleft? Let me check: "You may move from location pos42 to location pos32 following direction dirleft". Yes. So if the agent is at pos42, they can move to pos32 via dirleft. But pos32 is occupied by the stone, so the agent can't move there. Wait, no: the action doesn't require the agent to move there; the agent is at l_p (pos42), and the stone is at l_from (pos32). The precondition is that the agent is at l_p (pos42), stone is at l_from (pos32), l_to (pos22) is clear, and the direction from l_p (pos42) to l_from (pos32) is dirleft. Then the stone is pushed from l_from (pos32) to l_to (pos22) via dirleft. Yes, because pos32 to pos22 is allowed via dirleft.

So the action would be:

pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos22 dirleft

Preconditions check:

(i) agent is at pos42: Yes, after moving there.

(ii) stone1 is at pos32: Initially true.

(iii) pos22 is clear: Initially, pos22 is clear.

(iv) can move from pos42 to pos32 via dirleft: Yes.

(v) can move from pos32 to pos22 via dirleft: Yes.

(vi) pos22 is not a goal: Correct, since pos22 is not a goal.

So this action is valid. Then, the stone moves to pos22, and the agent moves to pos32 (but pos32 is now clear because the stone was pushed away). Wait, no: the effect of pushtonongoal is:

(i) agent is no longer at pos42.

(ii) stone is no longer at pos32.

(iii) pos22 is no longer clear.

(iv) agent is now at pos32.

(v) stone is at pos22.

So after this action, the agent is at pos32, and the stone is at pos22.

Then, the agent can push the stone from pos22 to pos23 (dirdown direction). Let's see. To push from pos22 to pos23, the agent must be at a location l_p that can move to pos22 via the direction used for the push. For example, if the agent is at pos32 (current location after the first push), they can move to pos22 via dirleft (since pos32 to pos22 is dirleft). Then pushing the stone from pos22 to pos23 via dirdown. So the action would be pushtonongoal (since pos23 is not a goal). Let's check:

Agent is at pos32, which is now clear. They need to move to a position adjacent to pos22 to push it. From pos32, can they move to pos22 via dirleft? Yes. Then, the stone is at pos22. The agent is at pos32. To push the stone from pos22 to pos23 (dirdown), the direction from l_p (pos32) to pos22 is dirleft. The stone would be pushed in direction dirleft from pos22. Wait, direction dirleft from pos22 would be to pos21. Because "You may move from location pos22 to location pos21 following direction dirup". No, wait: pos22's movements:

"You may move from location pos22 to location pos12 following direction dirleft"

"You may move from location pos22 to location pos32 following direction dirright"

"You may move from location pos22 to location pos21 following direction dirup"

"You may move from location pos22 to location pos23 following direction dirdown"

So from pos22, dirleft is to pos12, dirright to pos32, dirup to pos21, dirdown to pos23.

So to push the stone from pos22 to pos23 (dirdown), the agent must be at a position that can reach pos22 via dirdown. But the agent is at pos32, which is south-east of pos22. Wait, pos32 is south of pos22? No, pos22 is row2, column2; pos32 is row3, column2. So pos32 is south of pos22. So direction from pos32 to pos22 is dirup. So to push the stone from pos22 to pos23 (dirdown), the agent must be north of pos22? Or south?

Wait, the agent is at pos32, which is south of pos22. The direction from pos32 to pos22 is dirup. Then, pushing the stone from pos22 to pos23 (dirdown) would require that the direction from l_p (pos32) to pos22 is dirup, and the direction from pos22 to pos23 is dirdown.

So the action would be:

pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos22 pos23 dirdown

Wait, but the direction from pos32 to pos22 is dirup, not dirdown. So precondition (iv) requires that you can get from l_p (pos32) to l_from (pos22) via direction d (dirdown). But according to the movement list, can you move from pos32 to pos22 via dirdown? No. From pos32, the allowed directions are dirup (pos31), dirleft (pos22), dirright (pos42), dirdown (pos33). So moving from pos32 to pos22 is via dirleft, not dirdown. Therefore, this action is invalid.

Alternatively, the agent must be at a location that allows moving to pos22 via dirdown. For example, if the agent is at pos21 (row2, column1), they could move to pos22 via dirdown. Let's see:

pos21's movements: "You may move from pos21 to pos11 (dirleft), pos31 (dirright), pos22 (dirdown)".

So agent can be at pos21, then move to pos22 via dirdown. But pos22 is occupied by the stone after the first push, so the agent can't move there. Therefore, the agent needs to be at a position adjacent to pos22 where they can push the stone.

Let's think again. After the first push, the stone is at pos22, and the agent is at pos32. The agent needs to get to a position where they can push the stone from pos22 to pos23. To do that, the agent could move from pos32 to pos33 (dirdown), then to pos34, etc., but that's not helpful. Alternatively, the agent could move north from pos32 to pos22 via dirleft, but pos22 is occupied by the stone. So the agent can't move there. So perhaps the agent needs to move around.

From pos32, the agent can move to pos31 (dirup), then to pos21 (dirleft), then to pos22 (dirdown) — but pos22 is occupied. Alternatively, agent moves west to pos31 (dirup from pos32). Then, from pos31, can they push the stone at pos22? pos31 is row3, column1. pos22 is row2, column2. Not adjacent. So that's not possible.

Hmm. This is getting complicated. Maybe after the first push to pos22, the agent is at pos32. Then, the agent needs to move to pos23 to push the stone north. Wait, pos23 is east of pos22. So from pos22, the stone can be pushed east to pos23 via dirdown. But the agent needs to be south of pos22 to push it north? Or west?

Wait, to push the stone from pos22 to pos23 (dirdown), the agent must be at a location l_p that can reach pos22 via dirdown. For example, pos12 is north of pos22. If the agent is at pos12, they can move to pos22 via dirright (since "You may move from pos12 to pos22 following direction dirright"). Then, pushing the stone from pos22 to pos23 via dirdown (east). So direction d is dirright (from pos12 to pos22), and the stone moves from pos22 to pos23 via dirdown.

Wait, let's check the preconditions for this action:

pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos12 pos22 pos23 dirdown

Preconditions:

(i) agent is at pos12: Need to move there.

(ii) stone is at pos22: After first push.

(iii) pos23 is clear: Initially yes.

(iv) can move from pos12 to pos22 via dirdown. Wait, according to movement list, pos12 to pos22 is dirright. So direction would be dirright. Then, the stone is pushed from pos22 to pos23 via dirdown. But the action's direction is dirdown. So precondition (v) requires that pos22 to pos23 is allowed via dirdown. Yes: "You may move from pos22 to pos23 following direction dirdown". So this action would be valid.

But the agent needs to get to pos12. How? From pos32, after the first push, the agent is at pos32. They need to move to pos12. Path: pos32 → pos31 (dirup), pos31 → pos21 (dirleft), pos21 → pos11 (dirleft), pos11 → pos12 (dirdown). Then from pos12, push the stone to pos23.

But this seems lengthy. Let's see:

Action 1: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos22 dirleft

After this, agent is at pos32, stone at pos22.

Then agent needs to move to pos12:

Action 2: move player1 pos32 pos31 dirup

Action 3: move player1 pos31 pos21 dirleft

Action 4: move player1 pos21 pos11 dirleft

Action 5: move player1 pos11 pos12 dirdown

Then, Action 6: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos12 pos22 pos23 dirdown

Then, the stone is at pos23. Next, push it to pos13.

From pos23, the agent needs to be at a position to push it to pos13. pos13 is a goal location. So this would be a pushtogoal action.

To push from pos23 to pos13, the agent must be at a location that can reach pos23 via direction dirleft (since pos23 to pos13 is dirleft). For example, pos24 is east of pos23. So agent at pos24, push west (dirleft) to pos13. Alternatively, agent at pos13's north or south.

Wait, the movement from pos23 to pos13 is dirleft. So direction from l_p to pos23 would be dirleft. So the agent must be at a location that can move to pos23 via dirleft. Looking at the movement list:

"You may move from location pos13 to location pos23 following direction dirright".

So the reverse, from pos23 to pos13, is dirleft. So the agent needs to be east of pos23 (pos24) to push it west. So agent at pos24, direction dirleft to pos23. Then push the stone to pos13.

So to get to pos24, the agent is currently at pos12 after Action 5. Path from pos12 to pos24:

pos12 → pos22 (dirright), pos22 → pos23 (dirdown), pos23 → pos24 (dirdown). But pos23 is occupied by the stone after Action 6.

Alternatively, after Action 6, the agent is at pos12. Then, they need to move to pos24. Let's see:

From pos12, move to pos13 (dirdown), then to pos14 (dirdown), etc. But pos13 is a goal location, but initially clear. So:

Action 6: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos12 pos22 pos23 dirdown

Agent is now at pos22 (since after pushtonongoal, the agent moves to l_from, which is pos22).

Wait, no. The effect of pushtonongoal is:

(iv) agent is at l_from (pos22)

So after Action 6, agent is at pos22, stone at pos23.

Then, the agent needs to move to pos24 to push the stone west to pos13.

From pos22, agent can move to pos23 (dirdown), but pos23 is occupied by the stone. So can't move there. Alternatively, move to pos21 (dirup), pos21 → pos31 (dirright), pos31 → pos32 (dirdown), pos32 → pos42 (dirright), pos42 → pos43 (dirdown), etc. This seems too long.

Alternatively, from pos22, the agent can move to pos24 via dirdown and dirright. Wait:

pos22 → pos23 (dirdown) — but stone is there.

pos22 → pos32 (dirright) — but pos32 is clear after first push.

So agent can move from pos22 to pos32 via dirright. Then, pos32 → pos42 (dirright), pos42 → pos43 (dirdown), pos43 → pos44 (dirdown), pos44 → pos34 (dirleft), etc. This is getting too complicated.

Maybe there's a better path. Let's think of pushing the stone from pos23 to pos13 directly. The agent needs to be east of pos23 (pos24) to push it west. So:

After Action 6, agent is at pos22. Then:

Action 7: move player1 pos22 pos23 dirdown — but pos23 is occupied by the stone. So can't.

Alternatively, agent moves from pos22 to pos21 (dirup), then to pos31 (dirright), then to pos32 (dirdown), then to pos42 (dirright), then to pos43 (dirdown), then to pos44 (dirdown), then to pos34 (dirleft), pos34 → pos24 (dirleft), then pos24 → pos23 (dirup). But pos23 has the stone, so agent can't move there. But from pos24, can the agent push the stone at pos23 west to pos13?

Yes. Because from pos24, the agent can move to pos23 via dirup. So direction d is dirup. Then, pushing the stone from pos23 to pos13 via dirup. Let's check:

Preconditions for pushtogoal:

(i) agent is at pos24.

(ii) stone is at pos23.

(iii) pos13 is clear.

(iv) can move from pos24 to pos23 via dirup. Check movement list: "You may move from pos24 to pos23 following direction dirup". Yes.

(v) can move from pos23 to pos13 via dirup. According to movement list: "You may move from pos23 to pos13 following direction dirleft". So direction from pos23 to pos13 is dirleft. So this would not satisfy precondition (v), which requires that the direction from pos23 to pos13 is the same as d (dirup). Therefore, this action is invalid.

Hmm. So the agent must push the stone from pos23 to pos13 using the correct direction. The correct direction from pos23 to pos13 is dirleft. So the agent needs to be at a location that can reach pos23 via dirleft. For example, pos24 is east of pos23. So direction from pos24 to pos23 is dirleft. Then, pushing the stone from pos23 to pos13 via dirleft.

But according to movement list, pos23 to pos13 is allowed via dirleft. So:

pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos23 pos13 dirleft

Preconditions:

(i) agent at pos24.

(ii) stone at pos23.

(iii) pos13 is clear.

(iv) can move from pos24 to pos23 via dirleft. According to movement list: "You may move from pos24 to pos23 following direction dirup". So no. Therefore, the agent can't move from pos24 to pos23 via dirleft. So this approach is invalid.

Alternatively, agent at pos13, push the stone from pos23 to pos13 via dirleft. But pos13 is west of pos23. To push west, the agent must be east of pos23 (pos24) and move west. So direction from pos24 to pos23 is dirleft. Then, pushing the stone from pos23 to pos13 via dirleft. But according to the movement list, pos24 to pos23 is dirup, not dirleft. So this is not possible.

This is really challenging. Maybe there's another way. Let's think of alternative paths.

Alternative plan: instead of pushing the stone up to pos22 and then east, perhaps push the stone east to pos33, then north to pos23, then west to pos13. Let's try:

1. Push stone1 from pos32 to pos33 (dirdown). Agent is at pos43 (south of pos33), pushes north. Wait, no. To push from pos32 to pos33 (dirdown), agent needs to be at pos33's south (pos43), direction dirdown to pos33. Then push the stone to pos33. But pos33 is not a goal. Then push north to pos23.

Wait, pos33 to pos23 is dirleft. So agent would need to be east of pos33 (pos34) to push west.

This is getting too complicated. Maybe there's a better approach considering the constraints.

Wait, the constraints require that:

- At least once, pos13 is not clear. That's achieved when the stone is there.

- If pos13 is not clear, then pos44 or pos45 must not be clear in that state or later. So after placing the stone at pos13, we need to ensure that either pos44 or pos45 is not clear. Since the agent is at pos13 after pushing the stone there, they can move to pos44 or pos45 and occupy one of them.

- pos41 must not be clear at least once. So the agent must visit pos41 or have a stone there. But the only stone is stone1, which ends at pos13. So agent must visit pos41.

- If pos41 is not clear, then earlier either player1 was at pos24 or pos35 was not clear. So when the agent is at pos41, we need to ensure that prior to that, the agent was at pos24 or pos35 was occupied.

- pos11 must not be clear at least once. So agent must visit pos11 or have a stone there. Stone can't go there, so agent must visit.

- If pos11 is not clear, then earlier either stone1 was at pos31 or pos52 was not clear. So when the agent is at pos11, prior to that, stone1 was at pos31 (which is not possible unless we push it there) or pos52 was occupied.

Given these constraints, the plan must include steps to satisfy them.

Let's try to incorporate these constraints into the plan.

First, main goal: push stone1 to pos13.

Constraints:

1. pos13 not clear: achieved when stone is there.

2. After pos13 is not clear, pos44 or pos45 not clear. So after pushing stone to pos13, agent can move to pos44 or pos45 and occupy it.

3. pos41 not clear: agent must be there at some point.

4. When pos41 is not clear, prior state must have player1 at pos24 or pos35 not clear.

5. pos11 not clear: agent must visit.

6. When pos11 is not clear, prior state must have stone1 at pos31 or pos52 not clear.

So, let's plan to satisfy all constraints.

Plan outline:

- Move agent to pos41 to satisfy constraint 3. But then, according to constraint 4, before that, agent must have been at pos24 or pos35 not clear. pos35 is initially clear. So agent needs to visit pos24 before going to pos41.

- Visit pos11 to satisfy constraint 5. Before that, need to have stone1 at pos31 or pos52 not clear. pos52 is initially clear. So stone1 must be at pos31 at some point before agent is at pos11. But stone1 starts at pos32. So need to push it to pos31, which is a non-goal location.

So steps:

1. Push stone1 from pos32 to pos31.

2. Then, move agent to pos11 (which makes pos11 not clear), which satisfies constraint 5, with the prior condition that stone1 was at pos31.

3. Then, move agent to pos24 to satisfy part of constraint 4.

4. Then, move agent to pos41, satisfying constraint 3 with the prior visit to pos24.

5. Push stone1 from pos31 to pos13 (but pos31 is not adjacent to pos13. Need to find a path).

Alternatively, after pushing stone1 to pos31, agent goes to pos24, then to pos41, then back to push stone1 to pos13.

But this seems complex. Let's see:

First, push stone1 from pos32 to pos31.

Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos31 dirup

Wait, agent needs to be at pos42 to push stone1 from pos32 to pos31 via dirup. Because direction from pos42 to pos32 is dirleft, but to push the stone to pos31, direction would need to be dirup. But according to movement list, pos32 to pos31 is via dirup. So agent must be at a location that can reach pos32 via dirup. For example, pos31 is north-west of pos32. So agent at pos31 can push the stone south-east to pos32 via dirdown. Wait, no. To push the stone to pos31, the agent must be at a location that can reach pos32 via the same direction as the stone's movement. For example, agent at pos32's south (pos42) wants to push the stone north-west to pos31. But the movement from pos42 to pos32 is dirleft. Then, pushing the stone from pos32 to pos31 via dirup. But according to the movement list, pos32 to pos31 is via dirup. So the action would be:

pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos31 dirup

Preconditions:

(i) agent at pos42: Need to move there.

(ii) stone at pos32: Initially true.

(iii) pos31 is clear: Initially, pos31 is clear.

(iv) can move from pos42 to pos32 via dirup. Wait, according to movement list, pos42 to pos32 is dirleft. So no. Therefore, this action is invalid.

Hmm. So to push stone1 from pos32 to pos31 (dirup), the agent must be at a location that can reach pos32 via dirup. Which locations can do that?

From pos32, dirup is to pos31. So agent must be at a location that can move to pos32 via dirup. Looking at the movement list, "You may move from location pos31 to pos32 following direction dirdown". So the reverse, from pos32 to pos31 is dirup. So agent must be at pos32 to move to pos31 via dirup. But pos32 is occupied by the stone. So agent can't be there. So this is impossible. Therefore, the stone cannot be pushed to pos31 directly from pos32.

Alternative approach: move the stone to pos31 via multiple pushes. For example, pos32 → pos22 → pos21 → pos31. But this seems complicated.

Alternatively, maybe the agent can push the stone west to pos31. But based on movement directions, it's not possible from the initial position.

This is getting too time-consuming. Let's try to find a way to satisfy the constraints without deviating too much from the main goal.

For constraint 6: When pos11 is not clear (agent is there), the agent must have previously had stone1 at pos31 or pos52 not clear. Since pos52 is initially clear, the only way is to have stone1 at pos31. But pushing stone1 to pos31 seems difficult. Alternative: make pos52 not clear. Since pos52 is initially clear, the agent can move there, making it not clear. So if the agent visits pos52 before going to pos11, that would satisfy the constraint.

So steps:

- Move agent to pos52 (making pos52 not clear).

- Then move to pos11 (making pos11 not clear), satisfying constraint 5, with the prior condition that pos52 was not clear.

This avoids needing to push the stone to pos31.

Similarly, for constraint 4: agent needs to visit pos24 before going to pos41.

So plan outline:

1. Move agent from pos51 to pos52 (dirdown). Now pos52 is not clear.

2. Move agent to pos53 (dirdown).

3. Move to pos43 (dirleft).

4. Move to pos33 (dirleft).

5. Move to pos32 (dirup) — but pos32 has the stone, so can't. Alternative path.

Wait, agent needs to reach the stone to push it. Let's try integrating the constraints into the main plan.

Alternative plan:

1. Move agent from pos51 to pos52 (dirdown). This makes pos52 not clear, which can help with constraint 6.

2. Move agent from pos52 to pos42 (dirleft).

3. Push stone1 from pos32 to pos22 (dirleft). This requires agent at pos42, stone at pos32.

Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos22 dirleft

Now stone is at pos22, agent at pos32.

4. Move agent from pos32 to pos31 (dirup).

5. Move to pos21 (dirleft).

6. Move to pos11 (dirleft). Now pos11 is not clear, satisfying constraint 5. The prior condition is satisfied because pos52 was not clear (action 1).

7. Move agent back to pos21 (dirright).

8. Move to pos22 (dirdown). But pos22 has the stone, so can't. Need to go around.

9. Move agent from pos21 to pos31 (dirright).

10. Move to pos32 (dirdown).

11. Push stone from pos22 to pos23 (dirdown). Requires agent at pos22's adjacent location.

Wait, after step 3, stone is at pos22. Agent is at pos32. Then agent moves to pos31 (step4), then to pos21 (step5), pos11 (step6), back to pos21 (step7), then to pos31 (step8), pos32 (step9). Then, agent can push stone from pos22 to pos23.

But agent is at pos32. To push stone from pos22 to pos23, agent must be at a location that can reach pos22 via dirdown. For example, agent at pos32 can move to pos22 via dirleft. Then push stone to pos23 via dirdown.

Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos22 pos23 dirdown

Preconditions:

(i) agent at pos32: Yes.

(ii) stone at pos22: Yes.

(iii) pos23 is clear: Yes.

(iv) can move from pos32 to pos22 via dirdown. No, movement from pos32 to pos22 is via dirleft. So invalid.

Hmm. Agent needs to be at pos12 to push the stone to pos23. But getting there would require more steps.

This is taking too long. Given the time constraints, I'll propose a possible plan that satisfies the main goal and the constraints, even if it's not optimal.

Proposed plan:

1. move player1 pos51 pos41 dirleft

2. move player1 pos41 pos42 dirdown

3. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos22 dirleft

   (Stone1 moves to pos22, agent at pos32)

4. move player1 pos32 pos31 dirup

5. move player1 pos31 pos21 dirleft

6. move player1 pos21 pos11 dirleft

   (Now pos11 is not clear, satisfying constraint 5. Prior condition: pos52 was not cleared in any step, but we didn't visit pos52. This is a problem. So this step invalidates constraint 6.)

So need to adjust.

Alternative:

1. move player1 pos51 pos52 dirdown (pos52 not clear)

2. move player1 pos52 pos42 dirleft

3. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos22 dirleft

4. move player1 pos32 pos31 dirup

5. move player1 pos31 pos21 dirleft

6. move player1 pos21 pos11 dirleft (now pos11 not clear. Prior condition: pos52 was not clear in step 1, so satisfies constraint 6.)

7. move player1 pos11 pos21 dirright

8. move player1 pos21 pos22 dirdown (but pos22 has stone; can't)

9. move player1 pos21 pos31 dirright

10. move player1 pos31 pos32 dirdown

11. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos22 pos23 dirdown

   (Stone1 at pos23, agent at pos22)

12. move player1 pos22 pos23 dirdown (can't, stone is there)

13. move player1 pos22 pos21 dirup

14. move player1 pos21 pos22 dirdown (can't)

This is not working. Maybe after step 3, agent is at pos32. Then:

4. move player1 pos32 pos42 dirright

5. move player1 pos42 pos43 dirdown

6. move player1 pos43 pos44 dirdown

7. move player1 pos44 pos34 dirleft

8. move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft

   (Now at pos24, satisfying part of constraint 4.)

9. move player1 pos24 pos14 dirleft

10. move player1 pos14 pos13 dirdown

   (pos13 is goal, but stone not there yet.)

11. move player1 pos13 pos23 dirright

12. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos23 pos13 dirleft

   (Invalid, since stone is not at pos23 yet.)

Alternative, after step 3, stone is at pos22, agent at pos32.

4. move player1 pos32 pos33 dirdown

5. move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown

6. move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright

7. move player1 pos44 pos43 dirup

8. move player1 pos43 pos33 dirup

9. move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft

10. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos22 pos13 dirleft

   (But stone is at pos22, agent at pos23. Can agent push from pos22 to pos13?)

Wait, agent at pos23 can push the stone from pos22 to pos13 via dirleft. Preconditions:

(i) agent at pos23.

(ii) stone at pos22.

(iii) pos13 is clear.

(iv) can move from pos23 to pos22 via dirleft. Check movement list: "You may move from pos23 to pos22 following direction dirup". No. So invalid.

This is not working. Given the time, I'll provide a sample plan that tries to meet the constraints, but may not be optimal.
