**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Move from pos35 to pos34 (dirup):** The agent moves upward (decreasing row) from pos35 to pos34.
2. **Move from pos34 to pos33 (dirup):** The agent moves upward from pos34 to pos33.
3. **Push stone1 from pos23 to pos13 (dirleft):** The agent, now at pos33, pushes the stone left (upward, decreasing row) from pos23 to pos13. This uses `pushtonongoal` as pos13 is non-goal.
4. **Move from pos23 to pos22 (dirup):** After pushing, the agent is at pos23 and moves left (decreasing column) to pos22.
5. **Move from pos22 to pos12 (dirleft):** The agent moves upward (decreasing row) from pos22 to pos12.
6. **Push stone1 from pos13 to pos12 (dirup):** The agent, now at pos12, pushes the stone upward (decreasing row) from pos13 to pos12 using `pushtogoal` as pos12 is a goal.

This plan ensures all constraints are met: pos24 remains clear, and pos33/pos34 are blocked only transiently. The stone reaches the goal pos12 in minimal steps.
