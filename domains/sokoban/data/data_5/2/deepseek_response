The plan first moves the agent from pos25 to pos31 via a series of upward and right moves. The agent then pushes stone1 from pos32 to pos33, pos34, and pos44 using pushtonongoal actions. Finally, the agent uses pushtogoal to move the stone to the goal location pos45. After achieving the goal, the agent moves to pos51 to satisfy the "player1 at pos51" constraint. The constraints about pos33, pos53, and pos44 being occupied are satisfied during stone movement phases, and the pos51 requirement is met in the final steps.
