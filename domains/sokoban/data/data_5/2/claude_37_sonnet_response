Let me break down the problem:

1. We have a sokoban-like grid with an agent (player1), a stone (stone1), and a goal position (pos45).
2. The agent and stone are initially at pos25 and pos32, respectively.
3. We need to get the stone to a goal location (which is pos45).
4. We have several constraints:
   a. At some point, pos33 should be occupied.
   b. pos42 should be occupied in at most one continuous sequence of states.
   c. At some point, pos53 should be occupied.
   d. At some point, pos44 should be occupied.
   e. If pos44 is occupied, then either pos51 should be occupied or stone1 should be at pos34.
   f. At some point, player1 should be at pos51.

Let's visualize the 5x5 grid:

```
(1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (1,4) (1,5)
(2,1) (2,2) (2,3) (2,4) (2,5)
(3,1) (3,2) (3,3) (3,4) (3,5)
(4,1) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) (4,5)
(5,1) (5,2) (5,3) (5,4) (5,5)
```

Where posIJ corresponds to coordinates (I, J).

The stone is at pos32 (3,2) and the player is at pos25 (2,5). The goal is at pos45 (4,5).

Now, let's think about planning:

1. To satisfy constraint f, the player should reach pos51 at some point.
2. To move the stone to the goal at pos45, we might need to maneuver it through several positions.
3. Constraint a suggests that the stone or player should be at pos33 at some point.
4. Constraint c suggests that the stone or player should be at pos53 at some point.
5. Constraint d suggests that the stone or player should be at pos44 at some point.
6. Constraint e suggests that if pos44 is occupied, either pos51 should be occupied or stone1 should be at pos34.
7. Constraint b suggests that pos42 should be occupied in at most one continuous sequence of states.

Let's think about a plan to move the stone from pos32 to pos45, keeping the constraints in mind:

0. Player is at pos25, stone is at pos32.
1. Player needs to get to the left of the stone to push it to the right. So, player should move to pos31.
2. Push the stone from pos32 to pos33 (this satisfies constraint a).
3. Push the stone from pos33 to pos34.
4. Push the stone from pos34 to pos35 (from here, we can maneuver it upwards and then right to reach the goal).
5. Go around to pos45 (the goal) and push the stone from pos35 to pos45.

Now, let's refine the plan considering the constraints:

- Player should visit pos51 at some point, if we go below the stone that should be in this path
- We need to occupy pos53 at some point.
- We need to occupy pos44 at some point.
- When pos44 is occupied, either pos51 should be occupied or stone1 should be at pos34.
- pos42 should be occupied in at most one continuous sequence.

Given these constraints, let's adjust the plan:

0. Player is at pos25, stone is at pos32.

First, from the position of the player (pos25) to get to the left of the stone (pos31), the player can go:
pos25 -> pos24 -> pos23 -> pos22 -> pos32 -> pos31

Once at pos31, the player can push the stone from pos32 to pos33 (satisfying constraint a) by:
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos32 pos33 dirdown

Now, let's move the stone from pos33 to pos34 (satisfying constraint d when the player is at pos44):
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos34 pos35 dirdown

Now, we want to maneuver the stone to the goal (pos45). We could push it up to pos45 from pos35.

From these steps, we've satisfied constraints a and potentially d (to satisfy d, we might need to ensure the player is at pos44). We still need to satisfy constraints c, e, and f.

Let's adjust the plan to include a visit to pos51 (constraint f) and to ensure the stone passes through pos53 (constraint c):

After pushing the stone to pos35, the player can move around to pos45 (the goal) through pos44, pos43, pos53, pos52, pos51 (satisfying constraints c and f), and then pos52, pos53, pos43, pos44, pos45, then draw the stone to the goal.

Wait, I need to think about the directions and the pushes more carefully...

Let's look at the problem statement again. For "pushtonongoal" or "pushtogoal", the player needs to be on one side of the stone, and the stone gets pushed to the other side.

The way directions are defined, the "direction" parameter specifies the direction from the player to the stone. So, if the player is to the left of the stone and "dirright" is used, the stone will move to the right.

Let's redo the plan:

0. Player is at pos25, stone is at pos32.
1. Player needs to get to the left of the stone to push it to the right. So, player should move to pos31.
2. In the position pos31, the player can push the stone from pos32 to pos33 (satisfying constraint a) by using direction dirright.
3. Then, the player can push the stone from pos33 to pos34 by using direction dirright.
4. Then, the player can push the stone from pos34 to pos35 by using direction dirright.
5. To get the stone to the goal at pos45, the player needs to push it from pos35 to pos45, but the player has to go around to the bottom of pos35 (pos45).

Let me refine this plan further, step by step, to make sure it's valid and aligns with the constraints.

Alright, let's try a comprehensive plan:

Initial state: Player at pos25, stone at pos32.

1. First, the player needs to move to pos24: move player1 pos25 pos24 dirup
2. Then, move to pos23: move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup
3. Then, move to pos22: move player1 pos23 pos22 dirup
4. Then, move to pos21: move player1 pos22 pos21 dirup
5. Then, move to pos31: move player1 pos21 pos31 dirright
6. Now, player is at the left of the stone (which is at pos32). Push the stone to pos33 (satisfying constraint a): pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos32 pos33 dirright
7. now player is at pos32
8. Push the stone from pos33 to pos34: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos33 pos34 dirright (not sure if that's right... which do we put for l_p?)
9. Then, push the stone from pos34 to pos35: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos34 pos35 dirright (same question for l_p)

Wait I think I'm misunderstanding the syntax. Let me look at the problem statement again for the "pushtonongoal" and "pushtogoal" actions:

"pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": Make agent p, situated at location l_p, push stone s from location l_from to goal location l_to, following direction d.

So, p is the agent, s is the stone, l_p is the agent's location, l_from is the stone's location, l_to is the destination, and d is the direction.

For the direction, we need to consider the path from the agent to the stone.

For example, if the player is at pos31 and the stone is at pos32, then the direction is dirright because the stone is to the right of the player.

So for the first push, it would be: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos32 pos33 dirright

For the next push, the player will be at pos32 (after pushing) and the stone will be at pos33. So, the direction is still dirright and the push would be: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos33 pos34 dirright

Let's redo the plan again with the correct syntax:

Initial state: Player at pos25, stone at pos32.

1. First, the player needs to move to pos24: move player1 pos25 pos24 dirup
2. Then, move to pos23: move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup
3. Then, move to pos22: move player1 pos23 pos22 dirup
4. Then, move to pos21: move player1 pos22 pos21 dirup
5. Then, move to pos31: move player1 pos21 pos31 dirright
6. Now, player is at the left of the stone (which is at pos32). Push the stone to pos33 (satisfying constraint a): pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos32 pos33 dirright
7. The player is now at pos32 and the stone is at pos33. Push the stone from pos33 to pos34: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos33 pos34 dirright
8. The player is now at pos33 and the stone is at pos34. Push the stone from pos34 to pos35: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos34 pos35 dirright
9. Now, the player is at pos34 and the stone is at pos35. To get the stone to the goal, we need to push it from pos35 to pos45. For this, the player needs to be at pos35 and the stone needs to be pushed in the dirright direction.

But we need to satisfy the remaining constraints. Specifically, we need to make sure that pos44 is occupied at some point, and when it is, either pos51 is occupied or stone1 is at pos34. We also need to make sure that pos53 is occupied at some point and that the player visits pos51 at some point.

So the modified plan might be:

9. From pos34, the player can move to pos44: move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright (now pos44 is occupied, satisfying constraint d)
10. From pos44, the player can move to pos43: move player1 pos44 pos43 dirup
11. From pos43, the player can move to pos53: move player1 pos43 pos53 dirright (now pos53 is occupied, satisfying constraint c)
12. From pos53, the player can move to pos52: move player1 pos53 pos52 dirup
13. From pos52, the player can move to pos51: move player1 pos52 pos51 dirup (now the player is at pos51, satisfying constraint f)
14. From pos51, the player can go back to get in a position to push the stone to the goal:
   move player1 pos51 pos52 dirdown
   move player1 pos52 pos53 dirdown
   move player1 pos53 pos43 dirleft
   move player1 pos43 pos44 dirdown
   move player1 pos44 pos45 dirdown
   move player1 pos45 pos35 dirleft
15. Finally, push the stone from pos35 to pos45 (the goal): pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos35 pos45 dirright

But wait, there's one constraint I overlooked: "pos42 should be occupied in at most one continuous sequence of states."

This is a bit tricky. If we look at our plan, we don't seem to be passing through pos42. We'd need to adjust the plan if we want to ensure that this constraint is satisfied. But actually, this is a "at most one sequence" constraint, which means we can just not go through pos42 at all.

Actually, I think there's a correction to be made because the description of the action "pushtogoal" says the stone is pushed from location l_from to goal location l_to, following direction d. And for pushing, we need the agent to be adjacent to the stone in the direction opposite to the push.

So for the last step, it would be:
15. To push the stone from pos35 to pos45 (the goal), the player needs to be at pos25 (which is to the left of pos35): 
    move player1 pos35 pos25 dirleft
    pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos25 pos35 pos45 dirright

Gosh I think I'm making things too complicated. The actions clearly state:

For push: "You may only perform this action if (i) agent p is at location l_p, (ii) stone s is at location l_from, (iii) location l_to is clear, (iv) you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d, (v) you can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d.

So the direction d is the direction from the player to the stone AND the direction from the stone to its destination. The player and the stone need to be aligned so that the player can push the stone in the direction of d.

Given this, let me rethink the pushes:

If the player is at pos31 and the stone is at pos32, then the direction for the push to pos33 is dirright:
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos32 pos33 dirright

After this push, the player is at pos32 and the stone is at pos33. To push the stone from pos33 to pos34, the player needs to be at pos32 (left of the stone) and the push direction is dirright:
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos33 pos34 dirright

After this push, the player is at pos33 and the stone is at pos34. To push the stone from pos34 to pos35, the player needs to be at pos33 (left of the stone) and the push direction is dirright:
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos34 pos35 dirright

After this push, the player is at pos34 and the stone is at pos35. To push the stone from pos35 to pos45 (the goal), the player needs to be at pos25 (north of the stone) and the push direction is dirdown:
pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos25 pos35 pos45 dirdown

But the player is currently at pos34, which is to the left of pos35. The player would need to move to pos25 to push the stone from pos35 to pos45:

move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft
move player1 pos24 pos25 dirdown
pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos25 pos35 pos45 dirdown

But this doesn't satisfy the constraints like visiting pos51, pos44, and pos53.

Ugh! Let me try a different approach to push the stone to the goal, possibly satisfying these constraints.

Let's first visualize the 5x5 grid again and create a scheme for the stone's movement to pos45:

```
(1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (1,4) (1,5)
(2,1) (2,2) (2,3) (2,4) (2,5)
(3,1) (3,2) (3,3) (3,4) (3,5)
(4,1) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) (4,5) (Goal)
(5,1) (5,2) (5,3) (5,4) (5,5)
```

Currently, the stone is at (3,2) and the player is at (2,5). The goal is at (4,5).

We want the stone to go from (3,2) -> (3,3) -> (3,4) -> (3,5) -> (4,5) and along the way make sure the player visits (5,1) and the stone or player passes through (5,3) and (4,4).

Considering this is a sokoban-like game, we need to think about the positioning of the player to push the stone in the right directions.

To push the stone from (3,2) -> (3,3), the player needs to be at (3,1). 
To push the stone from (3,3) -> (3,4), the player needs to be at (3,2).
To push the stone from (3,4) -> (3,5), the player needs to be at (3,3).
To push the stone from (3,5) -> (4,5), the player needs to be at (3,4).

Hmm this approach means the player either never goes to (5,1) , (5,3) or (4,4). Let me try yet another approach. Instead of pushing the stone right, what if I push the stone down first? Actually no, if i push the stone down first, then I won't be able to satsify the constraint that the player has to be at (5,1).

Alright, let me try the following approach:

1. Push the stone down from (3,2) -> (4,2).
2. Push the stone right from (4,2) -> (4,3).
3. The player moves from (4,2) to (5,1) (satisfying the constraint).
4. The player moves back and pushes the stone from (4,3) -> (4,4) (satisfying another constraint).
5. The player pushes the stone from (4,4) -> (4,5) (the goal).

And along the way, we'll find a way to satisfy the constraint that the stone or player passes through (5,3).

Let me step through this:

Initial state: Player at (2,5), stone at (3,2).

1. Player moves:
   (2,5) -> (2,4) -> (2,3) -> (2,2) -> (2,1) -> (3,1)

2. Player pushes stone down from (3,2) to (4,2):
   pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos32 pos42 dirdown

3. Player moves from (3,2) to (5,1) via (3,1), (4,1), and then (5,1):
   move player1 pos32 pos31 dirup
   move player1 pos31 pos41 dirright
   move player1 pos41 pos51 dirright

4. Player moves from (5,1) to push the stone from (4,2) to (4,3):
   move player1 pos51 pos41 dirleft
   move player1 pos41 pos42 dirdown
   pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos42 pos43 dirright

Wait, this doesn't make sense because the player can't push the stone from a position the stone is already at.

I think I need to review the action descriptions more carefully...

Oh, I see the issue. For the push action, l_p is the player's current position, l_from is the stone's current position, and l_to is the position where the stone will go. So the player needs to be adjacent to the stone in the direction to which the player wants to push the stone.

For example, to push the stone from (3,2) to (3,3) (moving right), the player needs to be at (3,1) (left of the stone).

Let's clarify the plan:

Initial state: Player at (2,5), stone at (3,2).

1. Player moves from (2,5) to (3,1):
   move player1 pos25 pos24 dirup
   move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup
   move player1 pos23 pos22 dirup
   move player1 pos22 pos21 dirup
   move player1 pos21 pos31 dirright

2. Player pushes stone from (3,2) to (3,3) (satisfying constraint a):
   pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos32 pos33 dirright

3. Player pushes stone from (3,3) to (3,4):
   pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos33 pos34 dirright

4. Player pushes stone from (3,4) to (3,5):
   pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos34 pos35 dirright

5. Player moves from (3,4) to (5,1) via (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1):
   move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup
   move player1 pos33 pos32 dirup
   move player1 pos32 pos31 dirup
   move player1 pos31 pos41 dirright
   move player1 pos41 pos51 dirright

6. Player moves from (5,1) to (5,3) (satisfying constraint c):
   move player1 pos51 pos52 dirdown
   move player1 pos52 pos53 dirdown

7. Player moves from (5,3) to (4,4) (satisfying constraint d):
   move player1 pos53 pos43 dirleft
   move player1 pos43 pos44 dirdown

8. Player moves from (4,4) to (3,5) and positions to push the stone to the goal:
   move player1 pos44 pos34 dirleft
   move player1 pos34 pos35 dirdown

9. Player pushes stone from (3,5) to (4,5) (the goal):
   pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos35 pos35 pos45 dirright

Ah, there still seems to be confusion. In the push action, l_p is the player's current position, l_from is the stone's current position, and l_to is the destination for the stone. The direction d is the direction from the player to the stone, which is also the direction from the stone to its destination.

If the player is at (3,1) and the stone is at (3,2), to push the stone to (3,3), the direction would be dirright because you go from (3,1) to (3,2) in the dirright direction, and from (3,2) to (3,3) in the dirright direction.

Let's clarify the plan again:

Initial state: Player at pos25 (2,5), stone at pos32 (3,2).

1. Player moves from pos25 to pos31:
   move player1 pos25 pos24 dirup
   move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup
   move player1 pos23 pos22 dirup
   move player1 pos22 pos21 dirup
   move player1 pos21 pos31 dirright

2. Player pushes stone from pos32 to pos33 (satisfying constraint a):
   pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos32 pos33 dirright

3. Player pushes stone from pos33 to pos34:
   pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos33 pos34 dirright

4. Player pushes stone from pos34 to pos35:
   pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos34 pos35 dirright

Now, the player is at pos34 and the stone is at pos35. The goal is at pos45.

5. Player moves from pos34 to pos44:
   move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright

6. From pos44, the player moves to pos43:
   move player1 pos44 pos43 dirup

7. From pos43, the player moves to pos53:
   move player1 pos43 pos53 dirright

8. From pos53, the player moves to pos52:
   move player1 pos53 pos52 dirup

9. From pos52, the player moves to pos51:
   move player1 pos52 pos51 dirup

10. The player moves from pos51 back to push the stone to the goal:
    move player1 pos51 pos41 dirleft
    move player1 pos41 pos31 dirleft
    move player1 pos31 pos32 dirdown
    move player1 pos32 pos33 dirdown
    move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown
    move player1 pos34 pos35 dirdown

11. The player pushes the stone from pos35 to pos45 (the goal):
    pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos35 pos35 pos45 dirright

Wait, something is still off. In step 11, the player is at pos35 and the stone is also at pos35? This doesn't make sense.

Let's double check...

For the push action, l_p is where the agent is, l_from is where the stone is, and l_to is where the stone will be. The agent, stone, and destination need to be in a line, following direction d.

Ohhh I see, there's a misunderstanding in the action parameters. Let's clarify:

"pushtonongoal p s l_p l_from l_to d" means that the agent is at location l_p, the stone is at location l_from, and the stone will be pushed to location l_to, which is not a goal. The direction d indicates the direction from the agent's position l_p to the stone's position l_from, which is the same as the direction from the stone's position l_from to its destination l_to.

Let me think this through, more carefully:

One more try:

Initial state: Player at pos25 (2,5), stone at pos32 (3,2).

1. Player moves from pos25 to pos31:
   move player1 pos25 pos24 dirup
   move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup
   move player1 pos23 pos22 dirup
   move player1 pos22 pos21 dirup
   move player1 pos21 pos31 dirright

2. Player pushes stone from pos32 to pos33 (satisfying constraint a):
   pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos32 pos33 dirright

3. Player pushes stone from pos33 to pos34:
   pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos33 pos34 dirright

4. Player pushes stone from pos34 to pos35:
   pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos34 pos35 dirright

Now, the player is at pos34 and the stone is at pos35. The goal is at pos45.

5. Player moves from pos34 to pos44:
   move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright

6. From pos44, the player moves to pos43:
   move player1 pos44 pos43 dirup

7. From pos43, the player moves to pos53:
   move player1 pos43 pos53 dirright

8. From pos53, the player moves to pos52:
   move player1 pos53 pos52 dirup

9. From pos52, the player moves to pos51:
   move player1 pos52 pos51 dirup

10. The player moves from pos51 back to pos35:
    move player1 pos51 pos52 dirdown
    move player1 pos52 pos42 dirleft
    move player1 pos42 pos32 dirleft
    move player1 pos32 pos33 dirdown
    move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown
    move player1 pos34 pos35 dirdown

Wait, now the player and stone are both at pos35?

Oh, I made an error. After pushing the stone from pos34 to pos35, the player is at pos34, not pos34.

Ok there's still confusion. Here's the action decription again

"pushtonongoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": You may only perform this action if (i) agent p is at location l_p, (ii) stone s is at location l_from, (iii) location l_to is clear, (iv) you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d, (v) you can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d, and (vi) location l_to is not a goal location.

"pushtonongoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": After performing this action, (i) agent p is no longer at location l_p, (ii) stone s is no longer at location l_from, (iii) location l_to is no longer clear, (iv) agent p is at location l_from, (v) stone s is at location l_to, (vi) location l_p is clear, and (vi) stone s is at a non goal state.

So, after pushing, the player is at the former position of the stone.

Let's try again:

Initial state: Player at pos25 (2,5), stone at pos32 (3,2).

1. Player moves from pos25 to pos31:
   move player1 pos25 pos24 dirup
   move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup
   move player1 pos23 pos22 dirup
   move player1 pos22 pos21 dirup
   move player1 pos21 pos31 dirright

2. Player pushes stone from pos32 to pos33 (satisfying constraint a):
   pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos32 pos33 dirright

Now, the player is at pos32 and the stone is at pos33.

3. Player pushes stone from pos33 to pos34:
   pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos33 pos34 dirright

Now, the player is at pos33 and the stone is at pos34.

4. Player pushes stone from pos34 to pos35:
   pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos34 pos35 dirright

Now, the player is at pos34 and the stone is at pos35. The goal is at pos45.

To move the stone from pos35 to pos45, the player needs to be at a position from which they can push the stone to pos45. Given that pos45 is below pos35, the player needs to be above pos35 (at pos25) to push it down. But the player is currently at pos34, which is to the left of pos35.

5. Player moves from pos34 to pos24, then to pos25:
   move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft
   move player1 pos24 pos25 dirdown

6. Player pushes stone from pos35 to pos45 (the goal):
   pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos25 pos35 pos45 dirdown

But moving from (3,4) -> (2,4) -> (2,5) -> pushing stone to pos45 doesn't take us through pos44, pos53, and pos51, which we need to satisfy the constraints.

Let's try a different approach. Instead of pushing the stone directly to the goal, let's move the player around to satisfy the constraints and then come back to push the stone to the goal:

Initial state: Player at pos25 (2,5), stone at pos32 (3,2).

1. Player moves from pos25 to pos31:
   move player1 pos25 pos24 dirup
   move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup
   move player1 pos23 pos22 dirup
   move player1 pos22 pos21 dirup
   move player1 pos21 pos31 dirright

2. Player pushes stone from pos32 to pos33 (satisfying constraint a):
   pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos32 pos33 dirright

Now, the player is at pos32 and the stone is at pos33.

3. Player pushes stone from pos33 to pos34:
   pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos33 pos34 dirright

Now, the player is at pos33 and the stone is at pos34. This satisfies one part of constraint e (stone1 is at pos34).

4. Player moves from pos33 to pos43:
   move player1 pos33 pos43 dirright

5. Player moves from pos43 to pos44 (satisfying constraint d):
   move player1 pos43 pos44 dirdown

6. Player moves from pos44 to pos43:
   move player1 pos44 pos43 dirup

7. Player moves from pos43 to pos53 (satisfying constraint c):
   move player1 pos43 pos53 dirright

8. Player moves from pos53 to pos52:
   move player1 pos53 pos52 dirup

9. Player moves from pos52 to pos51 (satisfying constraint f):
   move player1 pos52 pos51 dirup

Now, all constraints are satisfied. Let's get the player to a position to push the stone to the goal.

10. Player moves from pos51 back to pos25 (from where they can push the stone to the goal):
    move player1 pos51 pos41 dirleft
    move player1 pos41 pos31 dirleft
    move player1 pos31 pos21 dirleft
    move player1 pos21 pos22 dirdown
    move player1 pos22 pos23 dirdown
    move player1 pos23 pos24 dirdown
    move player1 pos24 pos25 dirdown

11. Player pushes stone from pos34 to pos35 (which is NOT a goal):
    pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos25 pos34 pos35 dirdown

Wait, I think I misunderstood the action again. But we do have the  prerequsite descriptions:

For pushtonongoal:
(iv) you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d, (v) you can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d

That implies that l_p, l_from, and l_to are all in a straight line in direction d. The push is done by the player at l_p and will result in the player moving to l_from and the stone moving to l_to.

So to push the stone from pos34 to pos35, the agent would need to be on the other side, i.e. at pos33, and the action would be:
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos34 pos35 dirright

But to make the player at pos33 from the position after the player has been in pos51 is quite a long path. Let me think how to chain these actions most effecively:

Alright let's try again:

Initial state: Player at pos25 (2,5), stone at pos32 (3,2).

1. Player needs to go left of the stone to push it. So, player moves:
   move player1 pos25 pos24 dirup
   move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup
   move player1 pos23 pos22 dirup
   move player1 pos22 pos21 dirup
   move player1 pos21 pos31 dirright

2. Player pushes stone from pos32 to pos33 (satisfying constraint a):
   pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos32 pos33 dirright
   (Now player is at pos32, stone is at pos33)

3. Player pushes stone from pos33 to pos34:
   pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos33 pos34 dirright
   (Now player is at pos33, stone is at pos34)

4. Let me check if we can satisfy the constraint about pos44:
   (e) "If expression "Location pos44 is not clear" holds in some state s, then expression "At least one of the following conditions is true: "Location pos51 is not clear", "stone1 is at location pos34"" must hold at s or at some state after s"

   Currently, the stone is at pos34, so the latter part of this constraint is satisfied. Now we just need to make sure that at some point, pos44 is not clear. This can be done by the player moving to pos44.

5. Player moves from pos33 to pos43:
   move player1 pos33 pos43 dirright

6. Player moves from pos43 to pos44 (pos44 is not clear now, and stone1 is at pos34, so constraint e is satisfied):
   move player1 pos43 pos44 dirdown

7. Check the constraint about pos53:
   (c) "At some point, pos53 should be occupied."

   For this, we can have the player move to pos53:

8. Player moves from pos44 to pos43:
   move player1 pos44 pos43 dirup

9. Player moves from pos43 to pos53 (pos53 is not clear now, so constraint c is satisfied):
   move player1 pos43 pos53 dirright

10. Check the constraint about the player visiting pos51:
    (f) "At some point, player1 should be at pos51."

11. Player moves from pos53 to pos52:
    move player1 pos53 pos52 dirup

12. Player moves from pos52 to pos51 (player is at pos51 now, so constraint f is satisfied):
    move player1 pos52 pos51 dirup

Great, all the constraints are satisfied. Now we need to let the player push the stone to the goal.

13. To push the stone from pos34 to pos35, the player needs to be at pos33. From pos51, the player moves:
    move player1 pos51 pos41 dirleft
    move player1 pos41 pos31 dirleft
    move player1 pos31 pos32 dirdown
    move player1 pos32 pos33 dirdown

14. Player pushes stone from pos34 to pos35:
    pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos34 pos35 dirright
    (Now player is at pos34, stone is at pos35)

15. To push the stone from pos35 to pos45 (the goal), the player needs to be at pos25. From pos34, the player moves:
    move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft
    move player1 pos24 pos25 dirdown

16. Player pushes stone from pos35 to pos45 (the goal):
    pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos25 pos35 pos45 dirdown

After this, the stone is at the goal (pos45). That's our solution.

Let's double-check:

1. Constraint a: pos33 should be occupied at some point. This is satisfied in step 2 when the stone is pushed to pos33.
2. Constraint b: pos42 should be occupied in at most one continuous sequence of states. This is satisfied as pos42 is not occupied in any step. (OK, since "at most 1" means "0 or 1").
3. Constraint c: pos53 should be occupied at some point. This is satisfied in step 9 when the player moves to pos53.
4. Constraint d: pos44 should be occupied at some point. This is satisfied in step 6 when the player moves to pos44.
5. Constraint e: If pos44 is occupied, then either pos51 should be occupied or stone1 should be at pos34. This is satisfied because when the player is at pos44 (step 6), the stone is at pos34.
6. Constraint f: The player should be at pos51 at some point. This is satisfied in step 12 when the player moves to pos51.

All constraints are satisfied, and the stone is at the goal. This plan should be valid.

Let's do a quick check for optimality to do with constraint (e): If we occupied pos44 at some state, at that state (or in some later state), we need to either have the player at pos51 or the stone at pos34. In our solution, when the player is at pos44, the stone is at pos34, so this constraint is already satisfied. We don't need to have the player at pos51 in that case. So let's check if we can optimize: can we avoid going to pos51? Actually no, we can't because given constraint (f) that the player should be at pos51 at some point.

Alright, I think I've got the optimal plan.
