Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. So the goal is to get stone1 to a goal location, which is pos45 in this case. The initial state has the player at pos25 and stone1 at pos32. The constraints are a bit complex, so I need to make sure each of them is satisfied.

First, let's visualize the grid. The positions are arranged in a 5x5 grid, from pos11 (top-left) to pos55 (bottom-right). The only goal location is pos45. So the stone needs to end up there.

The player starts at pos25. Stone1 is at pos32. To move the stone, the player needs to get adjacent to it and push it. But pushing requires the next location to be clear. Let's see the movement paths.

From pos25, the player can move right to pos35, up to pos24, or left to pos15. But the stone is at pos32. So the player needs to navigate to pos32's adjacent positions to push it. Let's see the possible paths.

Looking at the allowed movements: from pos25, the player can go right to pos35. Then from pos35, right to pos45 (which is the goal), but pos45 is clear. Wait, the player can't move directly from pos35 to pos45 unless there's a path. Let me check the movement rules. The movement directions must be allowed.

The movement from pos35 to pos45 is allowed via direction dirright. Because "You may move from location pos35 to location pos45 following direction dirright". So, if the player moves from pos35 to pos45, that's possible. But the stone is at pos32. So how to get there.

Alternatively, the player needs to move up from pos25 to pos24, then left to pos23, etc. But that seems longer. Maybe a better path is to go from pos25 to pos35 (right), then pos35 to pos34 (up?), wait, the directions are dirup, dirdown, dirleft, dirright. Let me check the movement from pos35: "You may move from location pos35 to location pos25 following direction dirleft", "You may move from location pos35 to location pos45 following direction dirright", and "You may move from location pos35 to location pos34 following direction dirup". So from pos35, moving dirup would go to pos34. So, the player can move from pos35 to pos34 (up), then pos34 to pos33 (left?), wait, no. Let's see: from pos34, the movement options are left to pos24, right to pos44, up to pos33? Wait, looking at the movement list: "You may move from location pos34 to location pos24 following direction dirleft", "You may move from location pos34 to location pos44 following direction dirright", "You may move from location pos34 to location pos33 following direction dirup", and "You may move from location pos34 to location pos35 following direction dirdown". So pos34 can go up to pos33. So from pos35, the player can go up to pos34, then up to pos33, then left to pos32? Wait, pos33's movements: "You may move from location pos33 to location pos23 following direction dirleft", "You may move from location pos33 to location pos43 following direction dirright", "You may move from location pos33 to location pos32 following direction dirup", "You may move from location pos33 to location pos34 following direction dirdown". Wait, moving dirup from pos33 would go to pos32? Or is that a typo? Let me check again. The movement for pos33 says: "You may move from location pos33 to location pos32 following direction dirup". So yes, from pos33 moving up (dirup) goes to pos32. But that seems a bit counterintuitive since typically up would decrease the row number, but maybe in this grid, directions are defined differently. Wait, pos33 is row 3, column 3. So dirup might mean decreasing the row. So moving up from pos33 (row3) would go to pos23 (row2, same column), but according to the given movement, pos33 to pos23 is dirleft. Hmm, maybe the directions are a bit different. Maybe the directions are based on the grid's adjacency as per the given movement rules, not the typical cardinal directions. So I have to rely on the given movement paths.

In any case, according to the movement list, from pos33, moving dirup takes you to pos32. So if the player is at pos33, moving up (dirup) gets to pos32. But pos32 is where the stone is. So the player can get adjacent to the stone by being at pos33 and then pushing the stone from pos32 to pos42 (if possible) or to pos22, etc. Wait, but the stone is at pos32. The player needs to be at a position adjacent to pos32 in order to push it. The allowed directions for pushing would be such that the player is in a position adjacent to the stone, then pushes it in a direction away from the player.

So to push the stone from pos32, the player needs to be at a location that is adjacent to pos32. Looking at the movement options for pos32: the adjacent locations are pos22 (up), pos42 (down), pos31 (left), pos33 (right). Wait, the movement from pos32 is to pos22 (dirleft), pos42 (dirright), pos31 (dirup), pos33 (dirdown). Wait, no: "You may move from location pos32 to location pos22 following direction dirleft", "You may move from location pos32 to location pos42 following direction dirright", "You may move from location pos32 to location pos31 following direction dirup", "You may move from location pos32 to location pos33 following direction dirdown". So dirup from pos32 takes you to pos31, dirleft to pos22, dirright to pos42, dirdown to pos33. So the player can be at pos22, pos31, pos42, or pos33 to push the stone in the respective direction.

But the player starts at pos25. So how to reach those positions. Let's find a path from pos25 to pos33 or pos42 or pos22 or pos31.

Alternatively, maybe push the stone from pos32 to pos42 (right direction), then to pos52 (if possible), but pos52 is not a goal. The goal is pos45. So the stone needs to go from pos32 to pos45. Let's think about the path.

The stone is at pos32. To get to pos45, which is row4, column5. So from pos32 (row3, column2), the stone needs to move right to pos33, then pos34, pos44, pos45. But each move requires the player to be in the correct position to push.

Alternatively, push the stone up to pos22, then right to pos23, etc. But that might be longer. The optimal path is probably moving the stone right to pos33, then pos34, pos44, then down to pos45. But pos44 to pos45 is dirdown, which would be moving to pos45. So if the stone is at pos44, pushing it down (dirdown) would take it to pos45, which is the goal.

But the player needs to be adjacent to the stone to push. So, to push the stone from pos32 to pos33 (dirdown), the player needs to be at pos32's dirup, which is pos31. Wait, because pushing in direction dirdown would require the player to be at pos32's dirup (pos31) and then pushing the stone down (to pos33). Wait, the action "pushtogoal" requires the player to be at l_p (their current location), pushing the stone from l_from to l_to in direction d. The direction d is the direction from l_from to l_to. So for pushing the stone from pos32 to pos33 (dirdown), the player must be at a location that is adjacent to pos32 in the opposite direction. So to push the stone down (dirdown), the player must be at pos32's up direction, which is pos31. Wait, no: the direction is from l_from to l_to. So if the stone is moving from pos32 to pos33 via dirdown, then the player must be at pos32's direction opposite to dirdown. Wait, the action's preconditions say: "you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d". So the player is at l_p, and l_from is where the stone is. The direction d is the direction from l_p to l_from. So if the player is at l_p (pos33), and the stone is at l_from (pos32), then the direction d would be dirup (since moving from pos33 to pos32 is dirup). Wait, the movement from pos33 to pos32 is dirup. So to push the stone from pos32 to pos33 (dirdown), the player must be at a location l_p such that moving direction d from l_p gets to pos32, and moving direction d from pos32 gets to pos33. So d in this case is dirdown. Wait, no. Let me clarify.

The "pushtogoal" action's preconditions: (iv) you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d, and (v) you can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d. So direction d is the same for both movements. So the player is at l_p, moves direction d to reach l_from (stone's location), then the stone moves direction d to reach l_to.

So for example, if the player is at pos33, direction d is dirup. Moving dirup from pos33 would take the player to pos32 (stone's location). Then moving dirup from pos32 would take the stone to pos31. But that's not the direction we want. Alternatively, if the player is at pos31, direction d is dirdown. Moving dirdown from pos31 takes to pos32 (stone's location), then moving dirdown from pos32 takes to pos33. That's the direction we want. So in this case, the player is at pos31, pushes the stone from pos32 to pos33 using direction dirdown. So the action would be pushtonongoal (since pos33 is not a goal) player1 stone1 pos31 pos32 pos33 dirdown.

But first, the player needs to get to pos31. Let's see the path from pos25 to pos31. Starting at pos25, possible moves: right to pos35, up to pos24, or left to pos15. From pos35, can move right to pos45 (but that's a goal, but the stone isn't there yet), or up to pos34, or left back to pos25. Alternatively, from pos25, moving right to pos35, then up to pos34, then up to pos33, then left to pos32? Wait, but pos32 has the stone. Wait, maybe another path. From pos25, move right to pos35 (dirright). Then from pos35, move up (dirup) to pos34. From pos34, move up (dirup) to pos33. From pos33, move left (dirleft) to pos23? No, the movement from pos33 to pos23 is dirleft. Alternatively, from pos33, moving up (dirup) to pos32. But pos32 has the stone. So the player can't move into pos32 because it's occupied by the stone. So the player can't be at pos32. So to get to pos31, perhaps a different path. Let's see: pos25 → pos35 (right), then pos35 → pos45 (right). But pos45 is clear. Then from pos45, maybe move up to pos44. From pos44, move left to pos34. From pos34, move left to pos24. Hmm, this seems convoluted. Alternatively, from pos25, go up to pos24, then left to pos23, up to pos22, etc. But maybe that's longer.

Alternatively, the player can go from pos25 to pos24 (up), then pos24 to pos23 (up), pos23 to pos22 (up), pos22 to pos21 (up), pos21 to pos31 (right). Wait, from pos21, can move right to pos31. So the path pos25 → pos24 (up), pos24 → pos23 (up), pos23 → pos22 (up), pos22 → pos21 (up), pos21 → pos31 (right). That's five moves. Then from pos31, the player can push the stone at pos32 to pos33 (dirdown). Then the stone is at pos33. Then from there, the player can push it to pos34, then to pos44, then to pos45.

But each push requires the player to be in the correct position. Let's see:

After pushing the stone from pos32 to pos33, the player is at pos32 (since the effect of pushtonongoal is that the agent moves to l_from (pos32)). Then, to push the stone from pos33 to pos34 (dirdown), the player needs to be at pos33's dirdown direction's opposite. Wait, the direction for the push would be dirdown. So the player must be at pos33's up direction (dirup from pos33 is pos32). But pos33's up movement is to pos32. But after the first push, the player is at pos32. So to push the stone from pos33 to pos34, the player needs to move to pos33's dirup (pos32), but the stone is now at pos33. So the player is at pos32 (after the first push), and the stone is at pos33. So the player can then move to pos33's adjacent positions. Wait, pos33 is now occupied by the stone, so the player can't move there. The player is at pos32. To push the stone from pos33, the player needs to be adjacent to pos33. So possible directions: pos23 (up), pos43 (down), pos32 (left), pos34 (right). But pos33's movement options are: from pos33, you can go left to pos23, right to pos43, up to pos32, down to pos34. So the player is at pos32. To push the stone at pos33 in the direction dirdown (to pos34), the player needs to be at pos33's dirup (pos32). So direction d is dirup. Wait, because the player is at l_p (pos32), moving dirup to l_from (pos33). Wait, no. Let's re-express the action.

To push the stone from pos33 to pos34 (dirdown), the player must be at a location l_p such that moving direction d from l_p reaches pos33 (l_from), and moving direction d from pos33 (l_from) reaches pos34 (l_to). So direction d must be dirdown. So the player must be at l_p, which is pos33's direction opposite to dirdown. From pos33, dirdown is to pos34. So the player must be at pos33's up direction, which is pos32. So the player is at pos32, direction d is dirdown. Wait, moving dirdown from pos32 is to pos33. So to push from pos33 to pos34, the player must be at pos32, direction dirdown. So the action would be pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos33 pos34 dirdown. But wait, pos34 is a non-goal location (since pos45 is the only goal). So after pushing to pos34, the stone is there. Then the next step is to push it to pos44. To do that, the player would need to be at pos34's up direction (pos33), then push right (dirright) to pos44. Because moving from pos34 to pos44 is dirright. So direction d would be dirright. So the player must be at pos34's left direction (pos33) to push it right. So the player is at pos33, pushes the stone from pos34 to pos44 with dirright. But how does the player get to pos33 after the previous steps?

Wait, after the first push from pos32 to pos33, the player is at pos32. Then, the stone is at pos33. The player needs to move to pos33's adjacent positions to push it further. But pos33 is occupied by the stone, so the player can't be there. So the player is at pos32. From there, the player can move to pos31 (up), pos22 (left), pos42 (right), or pos33 (down, but it's occupied). So the player can move to pos42 (right) from pos32? Wait, the movement from pos32 to pos42 is dirright. So the player can move from pos32 to pos42. Then, from pos42, move to pos43, etc. But how does that help in pushing the stone at pos33 to pos34.

Alternatively, after pushing the stone to pos33, the player is at pos32. Then, the player can move to pos33's left (pos23?), but that might not help. Alternatively, the player can move up to pos31, then down to pos32 again, but that's not helpful. Hmm, maybe there's a better path.

Alternatively, after the first push to pos33, the player is at pos32. Then, the player can move to pos33's right (dirright from pos32 is pos42). Wait, pos32's movement to pos42 is dirright. So the player can move from pos32 to pos42. Then, from pos42, move to pos43, then to pos44. But how does that help in pushing the stone. The stone is at pos33. To push it to pos34, the player needs to be at pos33's up (pos32) and push down. But the player is now at pos42, which is far away. This seems like a detour.

Alternatively, maybe there's a different approach. Let's think about the constraints. The constraints are:

1. At least one state where pos33 is not clear. That could be when the stone is at pos33, or the player is there. But the player can't be there if the stone is there. So when the stone is pushed to pos33, that satisfies this constraint.

2. pos42 not clear in at most one continuous sequence. So the stone or player can be at pos42, but not for more than one consecutive step. So maybe push the stone through pos42 once, or have the player pass through quickly.

3. At least one state where pos53 is not clear. Maybe the player or stone is there. But the stone needs to go to pos45, so maybe the player visits pos53.

4. At least one state where pos44 is not clear. When pushing the stone to pos44, that's covered.

5. If pos44 is not clear in some state, then either pos51 is not clear or stone1 is at pos34 (either at that state or later). So when pos44 is occupied (by the stone or player), we need to ensure that either pos51 is occupied or stone1 is eventually at pos34. But since the stone is going to pos45, maybe pos51 must be visited by the player.

6. At least one state where player1 is at pos51.

So to satisfy constraint 6, the player must reach pos51 at some point. So the plan must include the player moving to pos51. That could be after moving the stone to pos45, but maybe that's not optimal. Alternatively, maybe the player needs to detour to pos51 during the plan.

Also, constraint 5: when pos44 is not clear (say, when the stone is at pos44), then either pos51 is not clear (player or stone is there) or stone1 is at pos34. Since stone1 is at pos44, we need to ensure that after that, either pos51 is not clear or stone1 reaches pos34. But since the stone is moving to pos45, pos34 is not in its path. So perhaps the player must visit pos51 after pushing the stone to pos44.

Alternatively, maybe during the pushing process, the player goes to pos51, which makes pos51 not clear, satisfying the implication.

So the plan must include steps where the player visits pos51. Let's think about how to incorporate that.

The player starts at pos25. To get to pos51, the path would be: pos25 → pos35 (right), pos35 → pos45 (right), pos45 → pos55 (right), pos55 → pos54 (up), pos54 → pos53 (up), pos53 → pos52 (left), pos52 → pos51 (left). That's a lot of moves. Alternatively, a shorter path? Let's check the movement options.

From pos25, right to pos35. From pos35, right to pos45. From pos45, right to pos55. Then from pos55, up to pos54. From pos54, up to pos53. From pos53, left to pos52. From pos52, left to pos51. So that's six moves. But that's a lot. Alternatively, maybe there's a different path. For example, pos25 → pos24 (up), pos24 → pos34 (right), pos34 → pos44 (right), pos44 → pos54 (right), pos54 → pos53 (up), pos53 → pos52 (left), pos52 → pos51 (left). But again, that's several steps. But given that the constraints require the player to be at pos51, it's necessary.

But how to integrate this into the plan. The optimal plan would have the player visit pos51 while moving the stone, but perhaps after moving the stone to the goal.

Alternatively, after moving the stone to pos45 (the goal), the player can then move to pos51. But that would add steps after achieving the goal, which is allowed as long as the goal is maintained. However, once the stone is at pos45 (a goal), the problem is solved, but the player can still move around. However, the constraints must be satisfied in the plan's states, including possibly after the goal is achieved.

But the problem says to bring about the goal, so the stone must be at a goal location in the final state. So the final action must be a pushtogoal to pos45.

So the plan must end with the stone being at pos45. Then, after that, the player can move to pos51 to satisfy the constraint.

But the constraints require that the player is at pos51 in at least one state. So the plan must include that move.

But adding moves after achieving the goal might not be optimal. So perhaps the player can visit pos51 before pushing the stone to the final position.

Alternatively, maybe during the pushing process, the player can detour to pos51.

But this seems complicated. Let's try to outline the steps:

1. Move the player from pos25 to pos35 (right).
2. Move to pos34 (up).
3. Move to pos33 (up).
4. Move to pos32 (up). But pos32 has the stone. Wait, no. After step 3, player is at pos33. From there, moving up (dirup) to pos32. But pos32 has the stone, which is not clear. So the player can't move there. So that path is blocked.

Alternative path: player needs to get to pos31 to push the stone from pos32 to pos33.

So:

1. Move player from pos25 to pos35 (move player1 pos25 pos35 dirright).
2. Move player to pos34 (move player1 pos35 pos34 dirup).
3. Move player to pos33 (move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup).
4. Move player to pos32 (move player1 pos33 pos32 dirup). But pos32 has the stone. So this is impossible. Therefore, the player can't reach pos32 via this route.

Alternative approach: from pos25, go up to pos24, then left to pos23, up to pos22, left to pos21, then right to pos31.

So steps:

1. move player1 pos25 pos24 dirup.
2. move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup.
3. move player1 pos23 pos22 dirup.
4. move player1 pos22 pos21 dirup.
5. move player1 pos21 pos31 dirright.

Now player is at pos31. From here, push the stone at pos32 to pos33 (dirdown). So action:

6. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos32 pos33 dirdown.

Now, stone is at pos33. Player is at pos32.

Next, push the stone from pos33 to pos34 (dirdown). For that, the player needs to be at pos33's up direction (pos32). So:

7. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos33 pos34 dirdown.

Now, stone is at pos34. Player is at pos33.

Then push the stone from pos34 to pos44 (dirright). For that, the player needs to be at pos34's left direction (pos33), direction dirright. So:

8. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos34 pos44 dirright.

Now, stone is at pos44. Player is at pos34.

Now push the stone from pos44 to pos45 (dirdown). Since pos45 is a goal, we use pushtogoal. But to push from pos44 to pos45 (dirdown), the player must be at pos44's up direction (pos34), and direction dirdown. So:

9. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos44 pos45 dirdown.

Now, stone is at pos45 (goal). Player is at pos44.

This completes the main goal. Now, the constraints:

- pos33 not clear: when the stone was at pos33 (step 6), this is satisfied.

- pos53 not clear: the player hasn't been to pos53 yet. So need to visit it.

- pos44 not clear: when the stone is at pos44 (step 8-9), this is satisfied. But the constraint 5 says if pos44 is not clear in some state, then pos51 not clear or stone at pos34. Since in step 8, stone is at pos44, we need to ensure that either pos51 is not clear at or after that state. Since after step 8, stone is at pos44, and then pushed to pos45 in step 9. So after step 8, the player is at pos34. Then in step 9, moves to pos44. Then after step 9, the stone is at pos45, player at pos44. So to satisfy constraint 5, after step 8 (pos44 not clear because stone is there), the player must go to pos51 or have stone1 at pos34. But stone1 is at pos44, then pos45. So the player must go to pos51 at some point after step 8.

So after step 9, the player is at pos44. From there, need to move to pos51. Let's see the path:

From pos44, possible moves: left to pos34, right to pos54, up to pos43, down to pos45 (but pos45 has the stone now). Wait, after step 9, the stone is at pos45, which is a goal. pos45 is now occupied by the stone, so the player can't move there. So from pos44, player can move left to pos34, up to pos43, right to pos54, or down to pos45 (blocked).

So player can move from pos44 to pos54 (dirright). Then from pos54 to pos53 (dirup). Then to pos52 (dirleft), then to pos51 (dirleft).

So steps after step 9:

10. move player1 pos44 pos54 dirright.
11. move player1 pos54 pos53 dirup.
12. move player1 pos53 pos52 dirleft.
13. move player1 pos52 pos51 dirleft.

Now, pos51 is not clear (player is there), satisfying constraint 6. Also, pos53 is not clear in step 11 and 12 (player at pos53 and pos52), which satisfies constraint 3. Also, pos42 not clear: when was that? During the pushes, the player may have passed through pos42. Let's check:

In the initial steps, the player moved from pos25 to pos24, pos23, pos22, pos21, pos31, then pushed to pos32, then to pos33, etc. So pos42 was not visited. Unless during the movement from pos32 to pos42. For example, after step 6, player is at pos32. From there, could move to pos42 (dirright). But in the current plan, after step 6, the player pushed to pos33 and then to pos34, etc. So pos42 hasn't been visited. But the constraint requires that pos42 is not clear in at most one continuous sequence. Since it's never not clear, this constraint is satisfied (0 sequences, which is <=1). So no action needed for that.

But wait, the constraint says "must hold in at most one continuous sequence". So the maximum allowed is one continuous sequence where pos42 is not clear. If it never holds, that's acceptable. So the current plan doesn't involve pos42, so that's fine.

Now, the constraints:

- pos33 not clear: when stone was there (step 6-7), satisfied.

- pos53 not clear: steps 11-12 (player at pos53 and pos52), satisfied.

- pos44 not clear: steps 8-9 (stone at pos44, then player at pos44 after pushing to pos45). Wait, after step 9, player is at pos44, and stone is at pos45. So pos44 is clear again? Wait, the effect of pushtogoal: after pushing, the player is at pos44 (l_from). So after step 9, the player is at pos44. So pos44 is not clear during step 9 and until the player moves away. So when the player is at pos44 (after step 9), pos44 is not clear. But the stone is at pos45. So during step 9, pos44 is cleared when the stone moves to pos45. Wait, the effects of pushtogoal:

"pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": 

Effects:

(i) agent p is no longer at l_p (pos34).

(ii) stone s is no longer at l_from (pos44).

(iii) l_to (pos45) is no longer clear.

(iv) agent p is at l_from (pos44).

(v) stone s is at l_to (pos45).

(vi) l_p (pos34) is clear.

(vii) stone s is at a goal state.

So after step 9, player is at pos44, which is now not clear. The stone is at pos45 (which is a goal). So pos44 is not clear in step 9's post-state.

Thus, when we have pos44 not clear (step 9 and beyond until player moves), the constraint 5 applies: if pos44 is not clear in some state s (like after step 9), then either pos51 is not clear at s or after, or stone1 is at pos34. So after step 9, the stone is at pos45, not pos34. So we need to make sure that pos51 is not clear at some state after s. So the player moving to pos51 (steps 10-13) achieves that. So when the player is at pos51 (step 13), pos51 is not clear, satisfying the implication.

So the plan includes all necessary constraints.

But let's count the steps. The main steps are:

1. move to pos24

2. move to pos23

3. move to pos22

4. move to pos21

5. move to pos31

Total of 13 steps. But maybe there's a shorter path.

Wait, is there a shorter path for the player to reach pos31 from pos25?

Alternative path: pos25 → pos35 (right), pos35 → pos34 (up), pos34 → pos33 (up), pos33 → pos32 (up) [but stone is at pos32, so blocked]. So can't go that way.

Alternatively, pos25 → pos24 (up), pos24 → pos23 (up), pos23 → pos22 (up), pos22 → pos21 (up), pos21 → pos31 (right). That's 5 moves. Then push to pos33, then pos34, pos44, pos45. Then move to pos54, pos53, pos52, pos51. Total 5 moves + 4 pushes + 4 moves = 13 steps. Same as before.

But maybe there's a better path. Let's see if the player can reach pos31 faster.

Wait, from pos25, can the player go right to pos35, then up to pos34, then left to pos24, up to pos23, etc.? Not sure. The initial path seems the fastest.

Alternatively, after step 9, when the player is at pos44, could there be a quicker way to reach pos51?

From pos44, move right to pos54, then up to pos53, left to pos52, left to pos51. Four moves. So steps 10-13.

Is there a way to combine any steps or reduce the number?

Alternatively, after pushing the stone to pos45, the player is at pos44. From there, move right to pos54 (step 10), then right to pos55 (but that's not helpful), then up to pos54? No. Wait, from pos44, moving right to pos54 (dirright). Then from pos54, moving up to pos53 (dirup). Then from pos53, moving left to pos52 (dirleft). Then from pos52, left to pos51 (dirleft). So four moves. So steps 10-13.

Alternatively, is there a path from pos44 to pos51 in fewer moves? Let's see: pos44 → pos43 (up), pos43 → pos42 (up), pos42 → pos52 (right), pos52 → pos51 (left). But that's four moves as well. Or pos44 → pos34 (left), pos34 → pos33 (up), pos33 → pos32 (up), pos32 → pos42 (right), pos42 → pos52 (right), pos52 → pos51 (left). That's longer. So the initial path seems optimal.

Now, check if all constraints are met:

- pos33 not clear: stone was there after step 6.

- pos42 not clear: never, so constraint satisfied (at most one sequence).

- pos53 not clear: player is there in step 11.

- pos44 not clear: after step 9 (player at pos44) and until step 10.

- For constraint 5: when pos44 is not clear (step 9), then pos51 becomes not clear in step 13.

- player is at pos51 in step 13.

So all constraints are satisfied.

But wait, the initial plan pushes the stone from pos32 to pos33, pos34, pos44, pos45. Then the player moves to pos51. But this plan requires 13 steps. Is there a more optimal plan with fewer steps?

Alternative approach: Maybe push the stone directly towards pos45 via a different path. For example, from pos32 to pos42, then to pos43, pos44, pos45. But pos42 is a non-goal, but if pushed there, then to pos43, etc. Let's see:

Player starts at pos25. To push the stone from pos32 to pos42 (dirright), the player needs to be at pos32's left (pos22). So player moves to pos22. But how?

From pos25, move up to pos24, then up to pos23, then up to pos22. Then from pos22, push the stone at pos32 to pos42 (dirright). Then from pos42, push to pos43, etc.

But that path might be longer. Let's calculate:

Steps:

1. pos25 → pos24 (up).

2. pos24 → pos23 (up).

3. pos23 → pos22 (up).

4. pos22 → pos32 (right). Wait, can the player move from pos22 to pos32? Yes, according to the movement list: "You may move from location pos22 to location pos32 following direction dirright". So yes. So step 4: move player1 pos22 pos32 dirright.

Now player is at pos32. But pos32 has the stone, so this is impossible. So the player can't move into pos32 if the stone is there. So step 4 is invalid. Therefore, the player must be adjacent to pos32 to push it. So from pos22, the player can push the stone at pos32 to pos42 (dirright), since the player is at pos22, direction dirright to pos32 (stone's location), then dirright to pos42. Wait, the action would be pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos32 pos42 dirright. Because pos42 is not a goal.

So steps:

1. move player1 pos25 pos24 dirup.

2. move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup.

3. move player1 pos23 pos22 dirup.

4. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos32 pos42 dirright.

Now, stone is at pos42. Player is at pos32.

Then, push the stone from pos42 to pos43 (dirright). The player must be at pos42's left (pos32), direction dirright. So:

5. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos42 pos43 dirright.

Now, stone is at pos43. Player is at pos42.

Then push to pos44 (dirright):

6. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos43 pos44 dirright.

Stone at pos44. Player at pos43.

Then push to pos45 (dirdown):

7. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos44 pos45 dirdown.

Now, stone is at pos45. Player at pos44.

Now, need to move to pos51:

8. move player1 pos44 pos54 dirright.

9. move player1 pos54 pos53 dirup.

10. move player1 pos53 pos52 dirleft.

11. move player1 pos52 pos51 dirleft.

Total steps: 11. Which is shorter than the previous 13 steps. But does this path satisfy all constraints?

Check the constraints:

- pos33 not clear: in this plan, the stone never goes to pos33. So this constraint is not satisfied. Oh no! So this path fails to meet the first constraint. Therefore, this approach is invalid.

Thus, we need to ensure that the stone passes through pos33 or the player is there. But in this alternative plan, the stone goes through pos42, pos43, pos44. So pos33 is never occupied. Therefore, the constraint that pos33 is not clear in at least one state is violated. Hence, this plan is invalid.

Therefore, the initial approach of pushing the stone through pos33 is necessary to satisfy the constraints.

So the first plan is the valid one, with 13 steps. But perhaps there's a way to reduce steps while still meeting all constraints.

Wait, in the initial plan, after step 9 (pushtogoal to pos45), the player is at pos44. Then steps 10-13 to reach pos51. But maybe after step 9, the player can go directly from pos44 to pos54, then to pos53, then to pos52, then to pos51. That's four steps. So total steps: 9 (main actions) +4 (moving to pos51) = 13.

But is there a way to combine the movement to pos51 with earlier steps?

Alternatively, after pushing the stone to pos44 (step 8), the player is at pos34. From there, perhaps the player can move to pos44 (dirright), then proceed to pos54, etc. But step 8 is pushtonongoal to pos44, which leaves the player at pos34. Wait, no:

After step 8, which is pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos34 pos44 dirright. The effects are:

- player is no longer at pos33.

- stone is no longer at pos34.

- pos44 is no longer clear.

- player is at pos34.

- stone is at pos44.

- pos33 is clear.

Wait, the action is "pushtonongoal p s l_p l_from l_to d". After performing this action:

(i) agent p is no longer at l_p (pos33).

(ii) stone s is no longer at l_from (pos34).

(iii) l_to (pos44) is no longer clear.

(iv) agent p is at l_from (pos34).

(v) stone s is at l_to (pos44).

So after step 8, the player is at pos34, and the stone is at pos44.

Then step 9 is pushtogoal from pos34 to pos44 to pos45. So:

9. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos44 pos45 dirdown.

Effects:

- player is no longer at pos34.

- stone is no longer at pos44.

- pos45 is no longer clear.

- player is at pos44.

- stone is at pos45.

So after step 9, player is at pos44.

Now, to get to pos51, player needs to go pos44 → pos54 (dirright), pos54 → pos53 (dirup), pos53 → pos52 (dirleft), pos52 → pos51 (dirleft). That's four moves.

But in this case, pos53 is not clear when the player is there (step 11), satisfying constraint 3. pos51 is not clear in step 13. Also, pos44 is not clear during step 9 (player is there after step 9), and the player then moves away in step 10. So constraint 5 is satisfied because after pos44 is not clear in step 9, the player moves to pos51 in step 13.

But the initial plan has 13 steps. Is there a way to shorten this?

Another idea: after step 6 (stone at pos33), can the player move to pos33's adjacent positions to push it further while also fulfilling other constraints? For example, after step 6, the player is at pos32. Can the player move to pos42 (dirright from pos32) to fulfill the pos42 constraint? But the pos42 constraint is that it's not clear in at most one continuous sequence. If the player moves to pos42, that makes pos42 not clear for one step, which is allowed. But does that help with any constraints?

Wait, the constraint on pos42 is that it's not clear in at most one continuous sequence. So if the player moves through pos42 once, that's acceptable. For example, moving from pos32 to pos42 (dirright), which takes one step. Then pushing the stone from pos33 to pos34 (from pos32), but that's not possible. Alternatively, maybe after moving to pos42, the player can push the stone from pos33 to pos43, but that would require the player to be at pos33's right direction (pos43), which is not the case.

Hmm, perhaps this isn't helpful. Let's stick to the initial plan.

Another way to fulfill pos53 not clear: the player moves to pos53 during their path. In the initial plan, they do that in steps 11 and 12. So that's covered.

Now, let's ensure that all constraints are met:

1. "Location pos33 is not clear" — yes, when stone is at pos33 (steps 6-7).

2. "Location pos42 is not clear" — in the initial plan, pos42 is never occupied, so constraint is satisfied.

3. "Location pos53 is not clear" — steps 11-12.

4. "Location pos44 is not clear" — steps 8-9.

5. If pos44 is not clear, then pos51 not clear or stone1 at pos34. After step 8, stone is at pos44. Player moves to pos51 in step 13, satisfying the requirement.

6. "player1 is at location pos51" — step 13.

Thus, the initial plan meets all constraints. Now, is there a shorter plan?

Alternative idea: after pushing the stone to pos33 (step 6), the player is at pos32. From there, instead of pushing to pos34, perhaps the player can move to pos42 and then push the stone in a different direction. But this would require the stone to take a longer path. For example, from pos33, push to pos43 (dirright), but that requires the player to be at pos33's left (pos23) or right (pos43) etc. But this might not be optimal.

Alternatively, after step 6, stone at pos33, player at pos32. The player can move to pos33's right (pos43?) Wait, no. From pos32, the player can move to pos42 (dirright). Then from pos42, move to pos43 (dirdown), then to pos44 (dirdown), and then push the stone from pos33 to pos43. But this seems complicated.

Alternatively, after step 6, player at pos32. Move to pos42 (dirright). Then from pos42, push the stone from pos33 to pos43 (dirright). But for that, the player must be at pos33's dirright direction (pos43), which is not adjacent. So this is not possible.

Hmm, perhaps the initial plan is the shortest possible that meets all constraints. Therefore, the final answer is the initial plan with the 13 steps.
