Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. Hmm, the goal is to get stone1 to a goal location. The only goal location mentioned is pos11. So I need to move stone1 from pos42 to pos11. But wait, the constraints add some complexity. Let me first outline the steps needed and then check the constraints.

First, the agent starts at pos53. Stone1 is at pos42. The agent needs to push the stone to a goal location. The only goal location is pos11. So the main objective is to push stone1 from pos42 all the way to pos11. But how?

Looking at the movement possibilities, let's see the grid layout. Positions are named as posXY, where X is the row and Y is the column. So pos11 is row 1, column 1. pos42 is row4, column2. The agent starts at pos53 (row5, column3). 

To push the stone from pos42 to pos11, the agent needs to navigate to positions adjacent to the stone and push it in the right direction. Let's see the possible paths. Let's break down the path from pos42 to pos11.

From pos42, moving left would go to pos32, right to pos52, up to pos41, down to pos43. Wait, according to the movement directions given, for pos42, the possible moves are:

- You may move from location pos42 to location pos32 following direction dirleft (since pos42's left is pos32? Wait, the movement directions are specific. Let me check:

Looking at the movement connections:

For pos42, the allowed moves are:

- "You may move from location pos42 to location pos32 following direction dirleft" (so left from pos42 is pos32)
- "You may move from location pos42 to location pos52 following direction dirright" (right to pos52)
- "You may move from location pos42 to location pos41 following direction dirup" (up to pos41)
- "You may move from location pos42 to location pos43 following direction dirdown" (down to pos43)

Wait, but the agent can't be in pos42 initially. The stone is at pos42, and the agent starts at pos53. So the agent needs to move to a position adjacent to pos42 to push the stone.

First, the agent is at pos53. To reach pos42, perhaps move up to pos43, then left to pos42? Let's check movement from pos53:

From pos53, the agent can move up (dirup) to pos52, left (dirleft) to pos43, or down (dirdown) to pos54. Wait, the movement options for pos53 are:

"You may move from location pos53 to location pos43 following direction dirleft"
"You may move from location pos53 to location pos52 following direction dirup"
"You may move from location pos53 to location pos54 following direction dirdown"

So to get to pos42, the agent needs to go from pos53 to pos43 (dirleft), then from pos43 to pos42 (dirup, but wait, let's check pos43's movement options:

From pos43, the allowed moves are:

"You may move from location pos43 to location pos33 following direction dirleft"
"You may move from location pos43 to location pos53 following direction dirright"
"You may move from location pos43 to location pos42 following direction dirup"
"You may move from location pos43 to location pos44 following direction dirdown"

So from pos43, moving up (dirup) takes the agent to pos42. So the agent can go from pos53 to pos43 (dirleft), then to pos42 (dirup). But pos42 has the stone. Wait, but the stone is at pos42, which is a non-goal location. The agent can't move into pos42 if it's occupied by the stone. Wait, the initial state says "Location pos42 is clear", but the stone is at pos42. Wait, that's a contradiction. Wait, no: the original state says "stone1 is at location pos42" and "Location pos42 is clear". Wait, that can't be right. If the stone is at pos42, then pos42 is not clear. But according to the given initial state:

Original state:

"stone1 is at location pos42"
...
"Location pos42 is clear"

Wait, that's conflicting. But according to the problem statement, each position may contain either the agent, a stone, or be empty. So if a stone is present, the location is not clear. But the initial state says "Location pos42 is clear" while also stating "stone1 is at location pos42". That must be a mistake. Wait, let me check again.

Looking back at the problem statement:

Original state:

"player1 is at location pos53"

"stone1 is at location pos42"

"Location pos11 is clear"

... (many locations listed as clear, including pos42: "Location pos42 is clear")

Wait, this is a problem. Because if the stone is at pos42, then pos42 should not be clear. So this must be an error in the problem statement. But maybe I'm misunderstanding the "clear" predicate. Wait, perhaps "clear" means that there's no agent or stone. But in that case, the stone being there would make it not clear. So the initial state says pos42 is clear, but the stone is there. That's a contradiction. But since the problem is given as such, perhaps there's a misunderstanding. Maybe "clear" refers to being accessible for movement, but the stone can be pushed. Alternatively, maybe "clear" means no agent is present. Wait, the preconditions for "move" require that the destination is clear. For the move action, the agent can move to a location if it's clear (no agent or stone). But if a stone is present, the location is not clear. So in the initial state, pos42 is clear, but the stone is there. That's impossible. So perhaps this is a mistake in the problem statement. But given that, perhaps the stone's presence does not block the location's clear status. That can't be right. Alternatively, maybe "clear" refers to the agent not being there, but stones are allowed. But that's not how it's usually modeled. Hmm.

Wait, looking at the action preconditions:

For example, "move p l_from l_to d": preconditions include that l_to is clear. So if the agent is moving to l_to, l_to must be clear. So "clear" means no agent or stone is present there. Therefore, in the initial state, pos42 is clear, but stone1 is at pos42. That's impossible. Therefore, this must be a typo. Perhaps the stone is at pos43, but the problem states pos42. Alternatively, perhaps the "Location pos42 is clear" is a mistake. But according to the problem statement, we have to take it as given. This is confusing. Maybe the stone is at pos42, but the initial state says pos42 is clear, which is a mistake. But since the problem states it, perhaps we have to proceed under the assumption that pos42 is clear, meaning the stone is not there. Wait, but the problem says "stone1 is at location pos42". This is conflicting.

Wait, perhaps "Location pos42 is clear" in the original state is a mistake, and the stone1 is actually at pos42, making pos42 not clear. But the problem says both. This is a problem. However, since the user provided this, perhaps it's a typo, and the stone is at pos43, but given that the user says pos42, perhaps I should proceed as per the given data. Alternatively, maybe the "Location pos42 is clear" was a mistake, and the correct initial state has the stone at pos42, making pos42 not clear. But the problem lists both. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps "clear" in the problem's context refers only to the presence of the agent. That is, a location is clear if the agent is not there. In that case, a stone being present doesn't affect the clear status. But that's unusual, but perhaps that's the case here. So the initial state has stone1 at pos42, and pos42 is clear (no agent there). Then, when the agent moves into pos42, it would make it not clear. But in that case, the stone's presence doesn't block the agent from moving there. But that's conflicting with typical Sokoban-like rules. However, given the problem's actions, when you push a stone, the agent moves into the stone's previous position. For example, in pushtogoal, after pushing, the agent is at l_from (the stone's original position), and the stone is at l_to. So the agent can be in the same location as the stone? That can't be. So I think the problem's model is that a location can have either the agent or a stone or be empty. Therefore, in the initial state, if the stone is at pos42, then pos42 is not clear. But the problem states that pos42 is clear. This is a contradiction. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the problem statement. But since I have to work with the given information, perhaps I should proceed under the assumption that the stone is at pos42, and the "Location pos42 is clear" is an error and should be ignored. Alternatively, maybe the stone is not present, but that contradicts the problem's initial state. This is a conundrum. 

Wait, looking back, the original state says:

"stone1 is at location pos42"

Then, in the list of locations that are clear, pos42 is listed as clear. That's impossible unless "clear" refers to something else. Alternatively, maybe "clear" refers to the agent not being present. So if the agent is not there, the location is clear, regardless of stones. So in that case, a location can have a stone and be clear. That would make sense. So "clear" in the preconditions for moving would require that the agent is not present there. So the stone's presence doesn't affect whether a location is clear. Therefore, the agent can move to a location with a stone, but that's not possible because the move action requires the destination to be clear (i.e., no agent there). Wait, but the move action's preconditions say (ii) location l_to is clear. So if a stone is at l_to, but no agent, then l_to is considered clear. So the agent can move into a location with a stone? That doesn't make sense. But according to the problem's action definitions, the move action allows the agent to move to a location that's clear (i.e., no agent there), even if there's a stone. But that would mean that the agent can be in the same location as a stone, which contradicts the initial setup where each position can contain either the agent, a stone, or be empty. Wait, the problem statement says: "Each position on the grid may contain either the agent, a stone or be empty." So a position can't have both. Therefore, if a stone is present, the position is not clear. Therefore, the initial state is contradictory. But since the problem states both, perhaps it's a mistake, and the stone is actually at a different location, but given the problem's details, I have to proceed. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended that pos42 is clear (no stone) and the stone is elsewhere, but according to the problem, the stone is at pos42. This is a problem. 

Given that this is a planning problem, and the initial state has stone1 at pos42 and pos42 is clear, perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the problem's setup. But since the problem is given, I'll proceed under the assumption that "clear" refers to the agent not being present, and stones do not affect clearness. Therefore, the agent can move to pos42 even if the stone is there. But that contradicts the problem's statement that each position can contain either agent, stone, or be empty. So perhaps the problem has a typo, and the stone is at a different location. But given the problem as stated, I need to find a way to handle this. Alternatively, perhaps the initial state's "Location pos42 is clear" is a mistake, and the stone's presence makes it not clear. So, for the purposes of solving the problem, I should consider that the stone is at pos42, making pos42 not clear. Therefore, the initial state's mention of pos42 being clear is an error, and we should ignore it. 

But the problem states the initial state as:

"stone1 is at location pos42"

"Location pos42 is clear"

This is conflicting. Therefore, perhaps the correct approach is to proceed under the assumption that the stone is indeed at pos42, and the "clear" status is incorrectly stated, but the problem's actions' preconditions require that when pushing a stone, the stone is at l_from, and the agent is at l_p (adjacent to l_from). Therefore, the agent must be able to reach positions adjacent to the stone to push it. 

Given that, the agent is at pos53. The stone is at pos42. So the agent needs to get to a position adjacent to pos42 to push it. Adjacent positions to pos42 are pos32 (left), pos52 (right), pos41 (up), pos43 (down). 

The agent's path from pos53 to, say, pos43 (down from pos53 is pos54, but according to movement options, pos53 can move to pos43 via dirleft. Wait, from pos53, movement to pos43 is via dirleft. So pos53's left neighbor is pos43. Then, from pos43, moving up (dirup) would take the agent to pos42. But pos42 has the stone. So the agent can't move into pos42 if it's occupied by the stone. Therefore, to push the stone from pos42, the agent needs to be at a neighboring position and push it. For example, if the agent is at pos43 (south of pos42), they can push the stone north (dirup) to pos32? Wait, no. Wait, the direction for pushing. Let me think: the pushtogoal action requires that the agent is at l_p, adjacent to l_from (stone's current location), and the direction d allows moving from l_p to l_from. Then, the stone is pushed from l_from to l_to in direction d. 

For example, if the agent is at pos43 (south of pos42), then to push the stone north (from pos42 to pos32), the direction would be dirup. Wait, no. Let me check the movement directions. The direction from pos43 to pos42 is dirup. So if the agent is at pos43 and moves dirup to pos42, that's allowed only if pos42 is clear. But pos42 has the stone, so the agent can't move there. Therefore, to push the stone from pos42, the agent must be in a neighboring cell and use the pushtogoal or pushtonongoal action. 

So, for example, if the agent is at pos43, they can push the stone from pos42 to pos41 (up) if pos41 is clear. But pos41 is clear according to the initial state. Wait, but pos41 is a non-goal location. So using pushtonongoal. But the goal is to get the stone to a goal location (pos11). So the agent needs to push the stone towards pos11. 

Alternatively, the agent could push the stone from pos42 to pos32 (left), which is a non-goal location. Then from pos32, push it further left to pos22, etc., towards pos11. 

But let's map a path from pos42 to pos11. The goal location is pos11, so the stone needs to end up there. The path from pos42 to pos11 would involve moving left (to pos32, pos22, pos12, pos11) or up (pos41, pos31, pos21, pos11), but pos41 is row4, column1; moving up from there would be to pos31 (row3, column1), then pos21, etc. But which path is possible given the movement directions?

Alternatively, the agent could push the stone up to pos32 (left from pos42 is pos32), then left again to pos22, then left to pos12, then left to pos11. That would require pushing the stone left multiple times. Let's see if that's possible.

But first, the agent needs to get to a position adjacent to pos42 to push it. The agent starts at pos53. Let's plan the movement:

From pos53, the agent can move dirleft to pos43. Then from pos43, move dirup to pos42? But pos42 has the stone. So instead, the agent can't move there. Therefore, the agent needs to go around. Wait, perhaps the agent can go from pos53 to pos43 (dirleft), then from pos43 to pos33 (dirleft), then to pos32 (dirdown?), but wait:

Looking at pos43's movement options:

From pos43, you can go to pos33 (dirleft), pos53 (dirright), pos42 (dirup), or pos44 (dirdown). So from pos43, the agent can move to pos33 via dirleft. Then from pos33, where can they go?

From pos33, movement options are to pos23 (dirleft), pos43 (dirright), pos32 (dirup), pos34 (dirdown). So from pos33, moving dirup to pos32. That's possible if pos32 is clear. According to the initial state, pos32 is clear. So agent can move from pos53 to pos43 (dirleft), then pos43 to pos33 (dirleft), then pos33 to pos32 (dirup). Now the agent is at pos32, which is adjacent to pos42 (pos32 is to the left of pos42). Wait, pos32 is row3, column2. pos42 is row4, column2. So pos32 is directly north of pos42. Therefore, if the agent is at pos32, they can push the stone at pos42 south (dirdown) to pos43. Wait, but pos43's current status: initially, pos43 is clear. So the agent at pos32 can push the stone from pos42 (which is south of pos32) to pos43 (south of pos42). But pos43 is clear. So using pushtonongoal (since pos43 is not a goal location). But this would move the stone to pos43. Then, from there, push it further. 

But wait, the agent is at pos32. To push the stone at pos42 (which is south of pos32), the direction would be dirdown from pos32 to pos42, and then dirdown from pos42 to pos43. So the action would be pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos42 pos43 dirdown. 

After that, the stone is at pos43. Then, the agent is at pos42. Now, the agent can move to pos43 (if clear) to push the stone further. But pos43 now has the stone, so the agent can't move there. Alternatively, the agent can go from pos42 to another position. Hmm. 

But this seems complicated. Let's outline the steps:

1. Agent moves from pos53 to pos43 (dirleft).
2. Agent moves from pos43 to pos33 (dirleft).
3. Agent moves from pos33 to pos32 (dirup).
4. Agent pushes the stone from pos42 (south of pos32) to pos43 (dirdown), using pushtonongoal.
   - Now stone1 is at pos43.
5. Agent is now at pos42. From there, they can move to pos43 (if clear?), but pos43 has the stone. So they need to move elsewhere. Maybe pos42 to pos41 (dirup) if pos41 is clear. pos41 is initially clear.
6. Agent moves to pos41 (dirup from pos42). Then, they can push the stone from pos43 (south of pos41?) Wait, pos41 is row4, column1. pos43 is row4, column3. Not adjacent. So perhaps not. 

Alternatively, after pushing the stone to pos43, the agent is at pos42. Now, they can move to pos41 (up) or pos52 (right) or pos43 (down). But pos43 has the stone now. So they can move to pos41 (dirup) from pos42, which is allowed if pos41 is clear (which it is). So agent moves to pos41. Then, from pos41, move to pos31 (dirleft), then to pos21, etc. But this might not help. 

Alternatively, after pushing the stone to pos43, the agent needs to get to the other side to push it further towards pos11. Perhaps push it left to pos33, then to pos23, etc. Let's think.

After step 4, stone1 is at pos43. Agent is at pos42. 

Next steps:

Agent needs to get to a position adjacent to pos43 to push it. From pos42, the agent can move to pos41 (dirup), pos52 (dirright), or pos43 (dirdown). But pos43 has the stone, so moving there is not possible. So agent moves to pos41 (dirup). Now at pos41. From pos41, movement options are to pos31 (dirleft), pos51 (dirright), or pos42 (dirdown). Since pos42 is now clear (agent was there, but moved to pos41, so pos42 is clear? Wait, after pushing, the agent is at pos_from (pos42 in this case), so after the push, the agent is at pos42. Then, when moving to pos41, pos42 becomes clear. Wait, no. The effects of pushtonongoal are:

After pushtonongoal, agent p is at l_from (pos42), stone s is at l_to (pos43), and l_p (pos32) is clear. So after pushing, agent is at pos42, stone is at pos43. So pos42 now has the agent, making it not clear. pos43 has the stone, not clear. pos32 is clear. 

So, after step 4 (pushtonongoal), the agent is at pos42. To move from pos42, they can go to pos41 (dirup), pos52 (dirright), pos43 (dirdown), but pos43 has the stone. So they can move to pos41 or pos52. Let's choose pos41. 

5. Agent moves from pos42 to pos41 (dirup). Now at pos41. 

From pos41, the agent can move to pos31 (dirleft), pos51 (dirright), or pos42 (dirdown). pos42 is now occupied by the agent (from the previous move?), no. Wait, after step 4, agent is at pos42. Then step 5: move from pos42 to pos41 via dirup. So after moving, agent is at pos41, and pos42 is clear. 

Now, to push the stone from pos43, the agent needs to be adjacent to it. pos43 is adjacent to pos33 (left), pos53 (right), pos42 (up), pos44 (down). The agent is at pos41. To get to pos33, perhaps move from pos41 to pos31 (dirleft), then to pos32 (dirdown?), but that might not be direct. Alternatively, agent could go from pos41 to pos42 (dirdown), but pos42 is clear now. Wait, agent is at pos41. From there, pos42 is south (dirdown). If pos42 is clear (since agent left it), then agent can move to pos42. Then from pos42, move to pos43 (dirdown), but pos43 has the stone. So no. 

Alternatively, agent can go from pos41 to pos31 (dirleft), then pos31 to pos32 (dirdown). Now at pos32. From pos32, can push the stone at pos43 (south) to pos44 (dirdown). But pos44 is a non-goal location. So using pushtonongoal. Wait, no: pushtogoal requires l_to to be a goal location. Since pos44 is not a goal, we use pushtonongoal. 

So steps:

6. Agent moves from pos41 to pos31 (dirleft).
7. Agent moves from pos31 to pos32 (dirdown).
8. Agent pushes stone1 from pos43 to pos44 (dirdown) using pushtonongoal. 

Now, stone1 is at pos44. Agent is at pos43. 

Then, agent can move from pos43 to pos44 (but pos44 has the stone now). So instead, agent moves elsewhere. From pos43, can move to pos33 (dirleft), pos53 (dirright), pos42 (dirup), or pos44 (dirdown). But pos44 is occupied by the stone. So agent moves to pos33 (dirleft). 

9. Agent moves from pos43 to pos33 (dirleft).

Now, agent is at pos33. From here, can push the stone at pos44 to pos34 (dirleft). pos34 is non-goal. 

10. Agent pushes stone1 from pos44 to pos34 (dirleft) using pushtonongoal. 

Wait, direction from pos33 to pos44? No. pos33 is row3, column3. pos44 is row4, column4. They are not adjacent. Hmm. Maybe I need to rethink the path. 

This approach seems inefficient. Maybe there's a better path. Let's consider pushing the stone from pos42 to pos32 first. 

Original position: stone at pos42. Agent needs to push it left to pos32 (non-goal). To do that, agent must be at pos42's west (pos32's east?), wait, pos32 is north of pos42. Wait, pos42 is row4, column2. pos32 is row3, column2. So to push the stone north to pos32, the agent needs to be south of pos42 (pos43) and push north. But pos43 is south of pos42. So agent moves to pos43, then pushes north to pos42 to pos32. Wait, no. The direction from pos43 to pos42 is dirup. So to push from pos42 to pos32, the agent needs to be at pos42's north side, i.e., pos32. Because pushing requires the agent to be adjacent to the stone in the direction of the push. Wait, the pushtogoal/pushtonongoal actions require that the agent is at l_p, which is adjacent to l_from (stone's current location), and the direction d allows moving from l_p to l_from. Then, the stone is pushed from l_from to l_to in direction d. 

For example, if the agent is at pos32 (north of pos42), they can push the stone from pos42 (south of pos32) to pos43 (south of pos42) via dirdown. But that's not helpful. Alternatively, the agent could be at pos32 and push the stone west to pos31. Wait, pos42 is row4, column2. To push west, the agent needs to be east of the stone. So to push west, the agent would be at pos42's east (pos52) and push west. But the stone is at pos42. So agent at pos52 can push the stone west to pos42's west neighbor, which is pos32 (if that's the case). Wait, no: pos42's west neighbor is pos32 (column2-1=column1?), wait, pos42 is column2. Left (west) would be column1, same row? No, pos42 is row4, column2. Left would be column1? No, perhaps the columns are numbered 1-5, left decreases column number. So pos42's left neighbor is pos41. Wait, no. Let me re-express the grid:

Rows are 1 to 5, from top to bottom. Columns 1 to 5, left to right. So posXY: X is row, Y is column. 

So pos42 is row4, column2. Its neighbors:

- North: pos32 (row3, column2)
- South: pos52 (row5, column2) → Wait no, row5 would be lower. Wait, row1 is top, row5 is bottom. So moving down increases the row number. Therefore, pos42's south neighbor is pos52 (row5, column2). Wait, no: pos42 is row4, column2. South would be row5, column2: pos52. North would be row3, column2: pos32. East would be row4, column3: pos43. West would be row4, column1: pos41. 

So to push the stone west from pos42 to pos41, the agent needs to be east of pos42 (pos43) and push west. But pos43 is east of pos42. So the direction from pos43 to pos42 is dirleft (west). So the agent at pos43 can push the stone west to pos41. 

But pos41 is a non-goal location. So using pushtonongoal. 

Alternatively, pushing north from pos42 to pos32: agent at pos42's south (pos52) and push north. But pos52 is south of pos42. Agent at pos52 can push north to pos42, but that's not possible since the stone is already there. 

This is getting complicated. Maybe it's better to map out the grid and possible moves. 

Let me sketch the grid rows 1-5 (top to bottom), columns 1-5 (left to right):

Row 1: pos11 (goal), pos12, pos13, pos14, pos15

Row 2: pos21, pos22, pos23, pos24, pos25

Row3: pos31, pos32, pos33, pos34, pos35

Row4: pos41, pos42 (stone), pos43, pos44, pos45

Row5: pos51, pos52, pos53 (agent), pos54, pos55

Agent starts at pos53 (row5, column3). Stone at pos42 (row4, column2). Goal is to move stone to pos11 (row1, column1).

So the stone needs to move from row4, column2 to row1, column1. That's up 3 rows and left 1 column. 

Possible path: push the stone up to row1, then left to column1. Or left then up. 

The challenge is to navigate the agent to push the stone through the grid, considering the movement connections. 

First, the agent needs to reach a position adjacent to the stone. The stone is at pos42. The agent is at pos53. Possible path:

1. Move from pos53 to pos43 (dirleft). 
2. From pos43, move dirup to pos42 (but pos42 has the stone, so can't move there. Instead, the agent can push the stone from pos42 if adjacent. So agent at pos43 can push the stone west (dirleft) to pos41 or north (dirup) to pos32. 

Wait, the agent is at pos43 (row4, column3). The stone is at pos42 (row4, column2). So the agent is east of the stone. To push the stone west (to pos41), the agent at pos43 can use dirleft (west) to reach pos42 (stone's location), then push it further west to pos41. 

But to perform a push action, the agent must be at l_p (adjacent to l_from, the stone's current position), and the direction must allow moving from l_p to l_from. Then, the stone is pushed from l_from to l_to in the same direction. 

So in this case, the agent is at pos43 (l_p). The stone is at pos42 (l_from). The direction from pos43 to pos42 is dirleft (west). So the agent can push the stone from pos42 to pos41 (dirleft), which is west of pos42. 

So the action would be pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos42 pos41 dirleft. 

Preconditions for this action:

(i) agent is at pos43 → yes.

(ii) stone1 is at pos42 → yes.

(iii) pos41 is clear → initial state says pos41 is clear. 

(iv) can move from pos43 to pos42 following dirleft → yes (according to movement options: pos43 can move to pos42 via dirup? Wait, no. The movement options for pos43 include moving to pos42 via dirup. Wait, let me check:

From the problem's movement options:

"You may move from location pos43 to location pos42 following direction dirup"

So moving from pos43 to pos42 is dirup. Therefore, to push the stone from pos42 to pos41 (west), the agent needs to be at pos42's east (pos43) and push west. But the direction from pos43 to pos42 is dirup, not dirleft. Therefore, the direction for the push would be dirup from pos43 to pos42, and then the stone is pushed in the same direction (dirup) from pos42 to pos32. 

Wait, that's confusing. Let me clarify:

The pushtogoal/pushtonongoal actions require that the agent can move from l_p to l_from following direction d, and from l_from to l_to following the same direction d. So in this case, if the agent is at pos43 (l_p) and wants to push the stone at pos42 (l_from) to pos32 (l_to), the direction d must allow moving from pos43 to pos42 and then from pos42 to pos32. 

But according to the movement options, pos43 can move to pos42 via dirup. Then, pos42 can move to pos32 via dirup. So direction d is dirup. 

Therefore, the action would be pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos42 pos32 dirup. 

Preconditions:

- Agent is at pos43: yes.

- Stone is at pos42: yes.

- pos32 is clear: initial state says pos32 is clear.

- Can move from pos43 to pos42 via dirup: yes.

- Can move from pos42 to pos32 via dirup: yes.

- pos32 is a non-goal location: yes. 

So this action is valid. 

Effects:

- Agent moves from pos43 to pos42.

- Stone moves from pos42 to pos32.

- pos43 becomes clear.

So after this action, the agent is at pos42, stone is at pos32. 

Now, the stone is at pos32 (row3, column2), which is non-goal. Next, push it further north to pos22. 

Agent is at pos42. To reach a position adjacent to pos32, the agent can move from pos42 to pos32 (dirup), but pos32 now has the stone, so it's not clear. So agent can't move there. Alternatively, the agent can move to pos41 (dirleft from pos42 is pos41) or pos43 (dirright), but pos43 is clear. 

Agent moves from pos42 to pos43 (dirright). Now at pos43. From pos43, move north to pos33 (dirup?), no. Wait, movement options from pos43: pos43 can move to pos33 (dirleft), pos53 (dirright), pos42 (dirup), pos44 (dirdown). 

Wait, after the first push, the agent is at pos42. To get to a position to push the stone at pos32, the agent needs to be adjacent to pos32. pos32's neighbors are pos22 (north), pos31 (west), pos33 (east), pos42 (south). 

Agent is at pos42 (south of pos32). So from pos42, the agent can push the stone at pos32 north to pos22. But to do that, the agent needs to be south of pos32 (at pos42) and push north. 

So the action would be pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos22 dirup. 

Preconditions:

- Agent is at pos42: yes.

- Stone is at pos32: yes.

- pos22 is clear: initial state says pos22 is clear.

- Can move from pos42 to pos32 via dirup: yes.

- Can move from pos32 to pos22 via dirup: yes.

- pos22 is non-goal: yes.

So this action is valid. 

After this, the stone is at pos22, agent is at pos32. 

Then, push the stone further north to pos12. Agent is at pos32. To push stone at pos22 north to pos12:

Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos22 pos12 dirup. 

Preconditions:

- Agent at pos32: yes.

- Stone at pos22: yes.

- pos12 is clear: initial state says pos12 is clear.

- Can move from pos32 to pos22 via dirup: check movement options. From pos32, can move to pos22 via dirup? According to the movement options:

"You may move from location pos32 to location pos22 following direction dirup" → yes.

- pos12 is non-goal: no, pos12 is not a goal location. 

So this action is valid. After pushing, stone is at pos12, agent at pos22. 

Then, push the stone west to pos11 (goal location). Since pos11 is a goal location, we can use pushtogoal. 

Agent is at pos22. To push the stone at pos12 west to pos11:

Action: pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos12 pos11 dirleft. 

Check preconditions:

- Agent at pos22: yes.

- Stone at pos12: yes.

- pos11 is clear: initial state says pos11 is clear.

- Can move from pos22 to pos12 via dirleft: check movement options. From pos22, can move to pos12 via dirleft? According to the problem's movement options: "You may move from location pos22 to location pos12 following direction dirleft" → yes.

- Can move from pos12 to pos11 via dirleft: check. From pos12, movement options include moving to pos11 via dirup. Wait, movement from pos12 to pos11 is dirup, not dirleft. Wait, the movement from pos12 to pos11 is dirup. So direction is dirup. 

Wait, this is getting confusing. The direction for the action must be such that moving from l_p to l_from is possible, and from l_from to l_to is possible in the same direction. So to push from pos12 to pos11, the agent must be south of pos12 (pos22) and push north (dirup). 

So the correct action would be pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos12 pos11 dirup. 

Preconditions:

- Agent at pos22: yes.

- Stone at pos12: yes.

- pos11 is clear: yes.

- Can move from pos22 to pos12 via dirup: yes (from movement options: pos22 to pos12 via dirleft, but wait, looking at the movement options:

"You may move from location pos22 to location pos12 following direction dirleft" → dirleft. So the direction from pos22 to pos12 is dirleft. Therefore, to push from pos12 to pos11, the direction must allow moving from pos12 to pos11. According to the movement options, pos12 can move to pos11 via dirup. Wait, no. Let me check:

The movement options include:

"You may move from location pos12 to location pos11 following direction dirup" → yes. So to move from pos12 to pos11, direction is dirup. 

But the agent is at pos22. To get to pos12 from pos22, the direction is dirleft. So the agent is at pos22, direction dirleft to pos12. Then, from pos12, direction dirup to pos11. So the action would need to use direction dirup. But the agent is moving from pos22 to pos12 via dirleft, but the stone is pushed from pos12 to pos11 via dirup. This violates the precondition that the direction must be the same for both movements. 

Therefore, this approach won't work. The agent must be positioned such that the direction from l_p to l_from and l_from to l_to is the same. 

So to push the stone from pos12 to pos11 (dirup), the agent needs to be south of pos12 (pos22) and push north (dirup). 

But can the agent move from pos22 to pos12 via dirup? According to movement options:

"You may move from location pos22 to location pos12 following direction dirleft". So no. The only way from pos22 to pos12 is dirleft. Therefore, the direction for the push would have to be dirleft. But then, pushing from pos12 to pos11 would require moving dirleft from pos12, but pos11 is north of pos12, not left. 

This indicates that the path from pos12 to pos11 is via dirup, not dirleft. So the agent can't push the stone from pos12 to pos11 using the same direction as moving from pos22 to pos12. 

Therefore, this path is invalid. So we need to find another way to push the stone from pos12 to pos11. 

Alternative approach: After pushing the stone to pos12, the agent needs to get to pos12's north (pos11) to push it south? No, that's not possible because pos11 is a goal location, and the stone needs to end up there. Alternatively, the agent can be east of pos12 and push west, but pos12's east is pos13. So agent at pos13 can push west to pos12, then west to pos11. But pos13 is initially clear. 

Alternatively, after the stone is at pos12, the agent can move to pos11 (if possible) and push the stone into pos11 from the north. But pos11 is a goal location, so once the stone is there, the goal is achieved. But how to get the agent there. 

But wait, pos11 is a goal location for the stone, not for the agent. The agent can move into pos11 if it's clear. 

So after the stone is at pos12, the agent needs to push it north to pos11. To do that, the agent must be south of pos12 (pos22) and push north. But from pos22 to pos12 is dirleft. Therefore, the direction for the push would be dirleft, but that would push the stone west from pos12 to pos11, which is north. This seems conflicting. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent can circle around to the east side of pos12. For example, agent moves from pos22 to pos23 (dirdown), then to pos13 (dirleft), then to pos12 (dirup). But pos13 is clear initially. 

This is getting too complicated. Let's think of a different path for the stone. 

Alternative path: push the stone from pos42 east to pos43, then north to pos33, then west to pos32, then north to pos22, etc. But this might not be shorter. 

Alternatively, considering the constraints provided:

Constraints:

1. "player1 is at location pos32" must hold in at least one state.
2. If player1 is at pos32, then pos34 must be not clear at or after that state.
3. "stone1 is at location pos42" must hold in at least one state (initially true, but maybe needs to be true again later? Or is the initial state sufficient? The problem says "at least one state", so the initial state satisfies this. So no action needed here.
4. If stone1 is at pos42 in some state, then pos45 must be not clear or pos54 not clear at or after that state.
5. At least one state where pos43 or pos45 is not clear.
6. At least one state where stone1 is at pos55 or pos24.
7. At least one state where stone1 is at pos13 or pos14 is not clear.

So the plan must satisfy these constraints. 

Let's address each constraint:

1. The agent must be at pos32 at least once. So during the plan, agent must visit pos32.

2. Whenever the agent is at pos32, then pos34 must be not clear (either at that state or later). So after visiting pos32, at some point pos34 must have something (agent or stone).

3. Already satisfied by initial state.

4. Whenever stone1 is at pos42 (initially true), then after that, either stone1 moves to pos45 or pos54 is not clear. Since the initial state has stone1 at pos42, we need to ensure that at some point after, either stone1 is at pos45 or pos54 is not clear. 

But after the initial state, the first action will move the stone away from pos42. So to satisfy this, we need to either have stone1 at pos45 later or make pos54 not clear. For example, agent moves to pos54, making it not clear. 

5. At least one state where pos43 or pos45 is not clear. Pushing the stone to pos43 would make pos43 not clear. So that's covered when we push the stone to pos43.

6. At least one state where stone1 is at pos55 or pos24. So during the plan, the stone must be at pos55 or pos24. Since the goal is to have it at pos11, which is a goal location, but this constraint requires it to be at pos55 or pos24 at some point. So the stone must pass through one of these locations. 

7. At least one state where stone1 is at pos13 or pos14 is not clear. Again, the stone must pass through pos13 or pos14 must be occupied at some point. 

Given these constraints, the plan must include steps that fulfill them. 

This complicates the planning. For example, the stone must pass through pos24 or pos55. But our initial plan of moving the stone up to pos32, then pos22, etc., doesn't go through pos24 or pos55. Therefore, the plan must detour the stone to one of these locations. 

Similarly, the stone must be at pos13 or pos14 must be occupied. So if the stone is moved to pos13, that's covered. 

Also, the agent must visit pos32. 

Additionally, after the agent is at pos32, pos34 must be occupied. So after the agent is at pos32, we need to ensure that pos34 is not clear at some point. For example, the agent or stone moves to pos34. 

This suggests that the plan must include a step where the agent moves to pos32, and later, either the agent or stone moves to pos34. 

Given all these constraints, the optimal plan might require moving the stone through pos24 or pos55 to satisfy constraint 6, and possibly pos13 for constraint 7. 

Let's try to adjust the plan accordingly. 

Alternative approach: Push the stone from pos42 to pos43, then to pos44, pos45, pos55 (satisfying constraint 6), then back to pos45, pos44, etc., towards pos11. But this would be longer. 

But the constraints require that in at least one state, stone1 is at pos55 or pos24. So pushing it to pos55 would satisfy that. 

Similarly, pushing it to pos24 would also satisfy. 

Let's aim to push the stone to pos24, which is closer to pos11. 

How to get from pos42 to pos24:

Pos42 → pos43 → pos44 → pos34 → pos24. 

But how to push that way. Let's see:

Agent starts at pos53. 

1. Move to pos43 (dirleft).

2. Push stone from pos42 to pos43 (dirup) using pushtonongoal. Now stone at pos43, agent at pos42.

3. Move agent to pos43 (dirdown? No, agent is at pos42. From pos42, move to pos43 (dirdown). But pos43 has the stone now. So can't. Instead, move to pos41 (dirup).

4. Agent moves from pos42 to pos41 (dirup). 

5. Agent moves from pos41 to pos31 (dirleft).

6. Agent moves from pos31 to pos32 (dirdown).

Now, agent is at pos32 (satisfies constraint 1). 

7. Now, need to ensure that pos34 is not clear at some point after this. Perhaps push the stone from pos43 to pos44, then to pos34. 

But stone is at pos43. Agent is at pos32. To push stone from pos43 to pos44, agent needs to be west of pos43 (pos33) and push east. 

But agent is at pos32. To get to pos33, move dirright to pos33. 

8. Agent moves from pos32 to pos33 (dirright). 

9. Agent pushes stone1 from pos43 to pos44 (dirright). Now stone at pos44, agent at pos43. 

10. Agent moves from pos43 to pos44 (dirdown). But pos44 has the stone. Can't. Instead, move to pos33 (dirleft).

11. Agent moves from pos43 to pos33 (dirleft). 

12. Agent pushes stone1 from pos44 to pos34 (dirleft). Now stone at pos34, agent at pos44. 

Now, pos34 is not clear (satisfies constraint 2 after agent was at pos32). 

13. Agent moves from pos44 to pos34 (dirleft). Now agent at pos34. 

14. Push stone from pos34 to pos24 (dirup). Now stone at pos24 (satisfies constraint 6). 

Now, the stone is at pos24. 

15. Agent needs to push it north to pos14, then to pos13, etc. 

But this is getting lengthy. However, we also need to satisfy constraint 7: stone at pos13 or pos14 not clear. Pushing the stone to pos14 would make pos14 not clear. 

Alternatively, after pushing to pos24, push north to pos14. 

16. Agent pushes stone from pos24 to pos14 (dirup). Now stone at pos14. 

Then, push west to pos13 (dirleft). Now stone at pos13 (satisfies constraint 7). 

Then push north to pos12, then west to pos11. 

This would satisfy all constraints. 

But this plan is getting very long. However, the problem requires an optimal plan, so we need the shortest possible. 

Alternatively, find a path that satisfies all constraints with minimal steps. 

Let me think of a path that pushes the stone to pos24 (satisfy constraint 6), then to pos14 (satisfy constraint 7 by making pos14 not clear), then to pos11. 

Additionally, during the plan, agent must visit pos32, and after that, pos34 is not clear. 

Also, during the plan, pos43 or pos45 must be not clear (when stone is at pos43 or pos45). 

And after initial state (stone at pos42), we need to make sure that either stone is at pos45 or pos54 is not clear. Since the stone is moving to pos43, then to pos44, pos34, pos24, pos14, etc., it doesn't go to pos45. So we need to have the agent move to pos54 to make it not clear. 

So perhaps after pushing the stone to pos24, the agent goes to pos54. 

Let's outline the steps with constraints in mind:

1. Move player1 from pos53 to pos43 (dirleft). 

2. Push stone1 from pos42 to pos43 (dirup) using pushtonongoal. Now stone at pos43 (satisfies constraint 5: pos43 not clear).

3. Move player1 from pos43 to pos33 (dirleft).

4. Move player1 from pos33 to pos32 (dirup) → now at pos32 (satisfies constraint 1).

5. To satisfy constraint 2 (after being at pos32, pos34 must be not clear), push stone1 from pos43 to pos44 (agent moves to pos43, then pushes). But agent is at pos32. Need to get to pos43:

6. Move player1 from pos32 to pos33 (dirright).

7. Move player1 from pos33 to pos43 (dirright).

8. Push stone1 from pos43 to pos44 (dirdown) using pushtonongoal. Now stone at pos44. Agent at pos43.

9. Move player1 from pos43 to pos44 (dirdown). Can't because pos44 has stone. So move to pos34 (dirleft). 

10. Push stone1 from pos44 to pos34 (dirleft). Now stone at pos34 (satisfies constraint 2: pos34 not clear after agent was at pos32).

11. Push stone1 from pos34 to pos24 (dirup). Now stone at pos24 (satisfies constraint 6).

12. Now, need to get stone to pos14 and pos13 or make pos14 not clear. Push stone from pos24 to pos14 (dirup). Now stone at pos14 (satisfies constraint 7: pos14 not clear).

13. Push stone from pos14 to pos13 (dirleft). Now stone at pos13 (satisfies constraint 7 again).

14. Push stone from pos13 to pos12 (dirup). 

15. Push stone from pos12 to pos11 (dirleft). 

But during these steps, we also need to ensure constraint 4: after stone is at pos42 (initially), either stone goes to pos45 or pos54 is not clear. Since the stone moves to pos43, we need to ensure that pos54 is not clear at some point. 

So after step 1, the stone is at pos43. Then, the agent could move to pos54 later. 

For example, after step 15, the agent needs to move to pos54. Let's see:

After step 15, agent is at pos12. To get to pos54, move south to pos22, then to pos32, pos33, pos34, pos44, pos54. 

But this adds steps. Alternatively, after step 10, when stone is at pos34, agent can move to pos44, then to pos54. 

But this is getting too long. Given the complexity, perhaps the optimal plan involves pushing the stone through pos24 and pos14, and the agent visiting pos32, then pos34 being occupied by the stone. 

Additionally, to satisfy constraint 4 (after stone is at pos42, either stone goes to pos45 or pos54 is not clear), we need to either push the stone to pos45 (which is not on the path to pos11) or have the agent move to pos54. 

The shortest way might be to have the agent move to pos54 after some steps. For example, after pushing the stone to pos43, the agent can go to pos54. 

Let's try integrating this:

After step 2 (stone at pos43), agent is at pos42. 

3. Move from pos42 to pos43 (dirdown). But pos43 has the stone. So invalid. 

Alternative path after step 2:

3. Move agent from pos42 to pos41 (dirup).

4. Move from pos41 to pos51 (dirright).

5. Move from pos51 to pos52 (dirdown).

6. Move from pos52 to pos53 (dirdown).

7. Move from pos53 to pos54 (dirdown). 

Now, pos54 is not clear (agent is there). This satisfies constraint 4. 

Then, proceed to push the stone towards pos11. 

But this adds many steps. 

Alternatively, after pushing the stone to pos43, agent moves to pos54 directly. 

But from pos43, how? pos43 to pos44 (dirdown), then to pos54 (dirright)? 

pos43 → pos44 (dirdown), then pos44 to pos54 (dirright). 

But movement options for pos44: can move to pos54 via dirright? Let's check:

From the problem's movement options:

"You may move from location pos44 to location pos54 following direction dirright" → no. The movement from pos44 to pos54 is dirright? pos44 is row4, column4. dirright would be column5, so pos45. pos54 is row5, column4. So to get from pos44 to pos54, the direction is dirdown. 

Movement options for pos44:

"You may move from location pos44 to location pos34 following direction dirleft"

"You may move from location pos44 to location pos54 following direction dirdown"

"You may move from location pos44 to location pos43 following direction dirup"

"You may move from location pos44 to location pos45 following direction dirright"

So from pos44, dirdown leads to pos54. 

So after step 2 (stone at pos43, agent at pos42):

3. Agent moves from pos42 to pos43 (dirdown). Can't because stone is there. 

Instead, agent moves from pos42 to pos52 (dirright). 

4. Agent moves from pos52 to pos53 (dirup). 

5. Agent moves from pos53 to pos54 (dirdown). 

Now, pos54 is not clear (agent is there), satisfying constraint 4. 

Then, agent proceeds to push the stone towards pos11. 

But this detour adds steps. 

Overall, this problem is quite complex due to the constraints and the initial state's possible inconsistency. To provide an optimal plan, I need to find the shortest path that satisfies all constraints. 

Given the time constraints, I'll outline a possible plan that addresses the constraints:

1. Move player1 from pos53 to pos43 (dirleft). 

2. Push stone1 from pos42 to pos43 (dirup) using pushtonongoal. Now stone at pos43 (satisfies constraint 5).

3. Move player1 from pos43 to pos33 (dirleft).

4. Move player1 from pos33 to pos32 (dirup) → satisfies constraint 1.

5. To satisfy constraint 2, push stone from pos43 to pos44. But agent is at pos32. Need to reach pos43:

   a. Move from pos32 to pos33 (dirright).

   b. Move from pos33 to pos43 (dirright).

   c. Push stone1 from pos43 to pos44 (dirdown) → stone at pos44.

6. Move player1 from pos43 to pos44 (dirdown) → can't (stone is there). So move to pos34 (dirleft).

7. Push stone1 from pos44 to pos34 (dirleft) → satisfies constraint 2 (pos34 not clear).

8. Push stone1 from pos34 to pos24 (dirup) → satisfies constraint 6.

9. Push stone1 from pos24 to pos14 (dirup) → satisfies constraint 7 (pos14 not clear).

10. Push stone1 from pos14 to pos13 (dirleft) → satisfies constraint 7.

11. Push stone1 from pos13 to pos12 (dirup).

12. Push stone1 from pos12 to pos11 (dirleft) using pushtogoal. 

But during this plan, we need to ensure constraint 4. Since the stone was at pos42 initially, and after step 2, it's at pos43, we need to ensure that either stone1 is at pos45 or pos54 is not clear. To do this, the agent must move to pos54 at some point. 

Insert steps after step 2 to have agent move to pos54:

After step 2:

3. Move player1 from pos43 to pos44 (dirdown).

4. Move player1 from pos44 to pos54 (dirdown) → pos54 not clear (satisfies constraint 4).

Then continue with pushing the stone. 

But this increases the plan length. Alternatively, after step 12, have the agent move to pos54. 

Given the complexity, the optimal plan would require careful step integration. However, due to time constraints, I'll provide a plan that fulfills all constraints and moves the stone to pos11, considering the required constraints.
