Let's organize this problem carefully. We're working with a 2D grid where we need to move stones to goal positions. Let's first understand the objects, their positions, and our goal.

From the problem description:
1. There's a player (player1) starting at position pos53.
2. There's a stone (stone1) starting at position pos42.
3. The goal is to have stone1 at a goal location.
4. The only goal location mentioned is pos11.

Let's represent the grid for better understanding (based on the connectivity information):

```
pos11 pos12 pos13 pos14 pos15
pos21 pos22 pos23 pos24 pos25
pos31 pos32 pos33 pos34 pos35
pos41 pos42 pos43 pos44 pos45
pos51 pos52 pos53 pos54 pos55
```

In this grid:
- player1 is at pos53
- stone1 is at pos42
- pos11 is the only goal location

Now let's consider the constraints:
1. "player1 is at location pos32" must be true at some point.
2. If player1 is at pos32, then pos34 must not be clear at that point or some point after.
3. "stone1 is at location pos42" must be true at some point. (This is already true at the start).
4. If stone1 is at pos42, then either stone1 is at pos45 or pos54 is not clear at that point or some point after.
5. Either pos43 or pos45 must not be clear at some point.
6. Either stone1 is at pos55 or stone1 is at pos24 at some point.
7. Either stone1 is at pos13 or pos14 is not clear at some point.

Given these constraints, let's plan how to move the stone to the goal (pos11).

First, we need to determine a path to move the stone from pos42 to pos11, ensuring all constraints are met.

From stone1's initial position (pos42), we need to push it to the goal (pos11). This would involve going through positions such as pos32, pos22, pos12, and finally pos11.

But we also need to satisfy the constraints:
- We need to visit pos32 at some point (which is on our path).
- After visiting pos32, we need to ensure pos34 is not clear.
- Stone1 starts at pos42 (satisfied).
- After stone1 is at pos42, we either need to move it to pos45 or ensure pos54 is not clear.
- Either pos43 or pos45 must not be clear at some point.
- We need to move stone1 to either pos55 or pos24 at some point.
- We need to move stone1 to pos13 or ensure pos14 is not clear at some point.

These constraints complicate our path planning. Let's think step by step:

1. We start with player1 at pos53 and stone1 at pos42.
2. To satisfy constraints, we might want to first push stone1 to pos55 (one of the required positions from constraint 6).
3. From there, we could potentially push it around to pos24, and then move it toward pos11 via pos23, pos22, pos12, pos11.
4. This would also satisfy the requirement to have stone1 at pos13 (on the way to pos11).

But wait, the constraint says either stone1 is at pos55 or stone1 is at pos24, and either stone1 is at pos13 or pos14 is not clear. So we don't necessarily need to visit both pos55 and pos24, and we don't necessarily need to visit pos13 if we ensure pos14 is not clear.

Let's try to formulate a plan, keeping the constraints in mind. I'll use the actions provided in the problem.

Starting positions:
- player1 at pos53
- stone1 at pos42

To satisfy the constraints, let's plan the following:
1. Move player1 to pos43 (adjacent to stone1 at pos42).
2. Push stone1 from pos42 to pos32 (player1 ends at pos42).
3. Move player1 from pos42 to pos33 (adjacent to stone1 at pos32).
4. Push stone1 from pos32 to pos22 (player1 ends at pos32).
5. Move player1 from pos32 to pos23 (adjacent to stone1 at pos22).
6. Push stone1 from pos22 to pos12 (player1 ends at pos22).
7. Move player1 from pos22 to pos13 (adjacent to stone1 at pos12).
8. Push stone1 from pos12 to pos11 (the goal) (player1 ends at pos12).

But this doesn't satisfy all the constraints. Let's check them one by one and adjust our plan:

1. "player1 is at location pos32" - This occurs after step 4.
2. "If player1 is at pos32, then pos34 is not clear" - This means after player1 is at pos32, we need to ensure pos34 is blocked. We can do this by pushing another stone to pos34, but we only have one stone in this problem. Maybe we need to rethink the path.
3. "stone1 is at location pos42" - This is satisfied at the start.
4. "If stone1 is at pos42, then stone1 is at pos45 or pos54 is not clear" - We're not planning to move stone1 to pos45, so we need to ensure pos54 is not clear after stone1 is at pos42. This is another constraint that's challenging to meet.
5. "Either pos43 or pos45 is not clear" - If we push stone1 to pos43 at some point, this constraint would be satisfied.
6. "Either stone1 is at pos55 or stone1 is at pos24" - Our current plan doesn't take stone1 to either of these positions.
7. "Either stone1 is at pos13 or pos14 is not clear" - We're not planning to move stone1 to pos13, so we need to ensure pos14 is not clear at some point.

It seems like our initial plan won't satisfy all the constraints. Let's reconsider and come up with a new plan.

Actually, after revisiting constraint 2, I realized the wording says "pos34 is not clear", which could mean there's a stone or the player at pos34. This is achievable by moving the player to pos34 at some point.

Similarly for constraint 4, "pos54 is not clear" can be achieved by moving the player to pos54.

For constraint 7, "pos14 is not clear" can be achieved by moving the player to pos14.

Let's adjust our plan:

Alright, let's rethink this. I think I misinterpreted some constraints.

The constraints are requirements that need to be true at some point, but they don't all have to be true at the end. They are checkpoints that need to be reached.

So, for instance, if stone1 starts at pos42 and we need it to be at the goal location (pos11), we can push it to other positions, as long as it ends up at pos11. Similarly, player1 can move to various positions, as long as the constraints are satisfied at some point.

Let's trace a potential path for the stone, taking into account the constraints:

1. Stone1 starts at pos42.
2. Pushing stone1 down to pos43 would ensure "Either pos43 or pos45 is not clear" (constraint 5).
3. From pos43, we could push stone1 right to pos44.
4. From pos44, we could push stone1 down to pos45. This satisfies "If stone1 is at pos42, then stone1 is at pos45 or pos54 is not clear" (constraint 4).
5. From pos45, we could push stone1 right to pos55. This satisfies "Either stone1 is at pos55 or stone1 is at pos24" (constraint 6).
6. From pos55, we need to get stone1 to pos11.
   - We could push it from pos55 to pos45, then to pos35, pos25, and so on.
   - But this would mean retracing our steps, which seems inefficient.

Maybe we should reconsider the path.

Actually, tracing the path backwards from pos11 (the goal) to pos42 (the starting position of stone1) might give us a clearer picture. Let's try that:

1. Stone1 at pos11 (goal).
2. Prior to that, stone1 at pos12, player1 at pos13.
3. Prior to that, stone1 at pos13, player1 at pos14.
4. Prior to that, stone1 at pos14, player1 at pos15. (Here, pos14 is not clear, satisfying part of constraint 7).
5. Prior to that, stone1 at pos15, player1 at pos25.
6. Prior to that, stone1 at pos25, player1 at pos35.
7. Prior to that, stone1 at pos35, player1 at pos45.
8. Prior to that, stone1 at pos45, player1 at pos55. (Stone1 at pos45 satisfies constraint 4).
9. Prior to that, stone1 at pos55, player1 at right of pos55 (which isn't possible). (Stone1 at pos55 satisfies constraint 6).

Wait, we can't push stone1 to pos55 from a position right of it, since the grid ends at pos55. We need to adjust.

Let's trace a different path, considering the constraints and the grid layout:

1. Stone1 starts at pos42.
2. We could push stone1 right to pos52, then to pos53, pos54, and pos55 (satisfying constraint 6).
3. From pos55, we could push stone1 left to pos45 (satisfying constraint 4), then to pos35, pos25, pos15.
4. From pos15, we could push stone1 up to pos14 (making pos14 not clear, satisfying constraint 7), then to pos13, pos12, and finally pos11.

But this path doesn't involve player1 going to pos32, as required by constraint 1.

Perhaps there's another path that satisfies all constraints.

Let's try a different approach. Given our current locations:
- player1 at pos53
- stone1 at pos42

And the constraints:
1. player1 must be at pos32 at some point.
2. After that, pos34 must not be clear.
3. stone1 is at pos42 (already satisfied).
4. After stone1 is at pos42, stone1 must be at pos45 or pos54 must not be clear.
5. pos43 or pos45 must not be clear at some point.
6. stone1 must be at pos55 or pos24 at some point.
7. stone1 must be at pos13 or pos14 must not be clear at some point.

Let's plan for player1 to move to pos32, in compliance with constraint 1, and then ensure pos34 is not clear (perhaps by moving player1 there). Then we'll plan how to push stone1 to a goal.

Alright, let's just sketch a plan that meets all constraints. We'll refine it afterwards.

1. Move player1 from pos53 to pos43.
2. Push stone1 from pos42 to pos32. (Now player1 is at pos42).
3. Move player1 from pos42 to pos32. (Satisfying constraint 1).
4. Move player1 from pos32 to pos34. (Making pos34 not clear, satisfying constraint 2).
5. Move player1 from pos34 to pos33.
6. Push stone1 from pos32 to pos33. (Now player1 is at pos32 and stone1 is at pos33).
7. Move player1 from pos32 to pos23.
8. Push stone1 from pos33 to pos23. (Now player1 is at pos33 and stone1 is at pos23).
9. Move player1 from pos33 to pos24.
10. Push stone1 from pos23 to pos24. (Now player1 is at pos23 and stone1 is at pos24, satisfying constraint 6).
11. Move player1 from pos23 to pos13.
12. Push stone1 from pos24 to pos14. (Now player1 is at pos24 and stone1 is at pos14, making pos14 not clear, satisfying constraint 7).
13. Move player1 from pos24 to pos14.
14. Push stone1 from pos14 to pos13. (Now player1 is at pos14 and stone1 is at pos13, satisfying part of constraint 7).
15. Move player1 from pos14 to pos13.
16. Push stone1 from pos13 to pos12. (Now player1 is at pos13 and stone1 is at pos12).
17. Move player1 from pos13 to pos12.
18. Push stone1 from pos12 to pos11. (Now player1 is at pos12 and stone1 is at pos11, the goal).

I think we're still missing constraints 4 and 5. Constraint 4 says after stone1 is at pos42, stone1 must be at pos45 or pos54 must not be clear. Since stone1 starts at pos42, we need to ensure this. We didn't push stone1 to pos45, so we need to make pos54 not clear. We could do this by moving player1 to pos54 at some point.

For constraint 5, pos43 or pos45 must not be clear at some point. We could ensure this by moving player1 to pos43 or pos45.

Let me refine the plan a bit more to satisfy all the constraints:

1. Move player1 from pos53 to pos54. (Making pos54 not clear, satisfying constraint 4).
2. Move player1 from pos54 to pos44.
3. Move player1 from pos44 to pos43. (Making pos43 not clear, satisfying constraint 5).
4. Move player1 from pos43 to pos42.
5. Push stone1 from pos42 to pos32. (Now player1 is at pos42 and stone1 is at pos32).
6. Move player1 from pos42 to pos32. (Satisfying constraint 1).
7. Move player1 from pos32 to pos34. (Making pos34 not clear, satisfying constraint 2).
8. Move player1 from pos34 to pos33.
9. Push stone1 from pos32 to pos33. (Now player1 is at pos32 and stone1 is at pos33).
10. Move player1 from pos32 to pos23.
11. Push stone1 from pos33 to pos23. (Now player1 is at pos33 and stone1 is at pos23).
12. Move player1 from pos33 to pos24.
13. Push stone1 from pos23 to pos24. (Now player1 is at pos23 and stone1 is at pos24, satisfying constraint 6).
14. Move player1 from pos23 to pos13.
15. Push stone1 from pos24 to pos14. (Now player1 is at pos24 and stone1 is at pos14, making pos14 not clear, satisfying constraint 7).
16. Move player1 from pos24 to pos14.
17. Push stone1 from pos14 to pos13. (Now player1 is at pos14 and stone1 is at pos13, satisfying part of constraint 7).
18. Move player1 from pos14 to pos13.
19. Push stone1 from pos13 to pos12. (Now player1 is at pos13 and stone1 is at pos12).
20. Move player1 from pos13 to pos12.
21. Push stone1 from pos12 to pos11. (Now player1 is at pos12 and stone1 is at pos11, the goal).

Actually constraints 4 and 5 are a bit complex. Let's make sure I understand them:

Constraint 4: "If expression 'stone1 is at location pos42' holds in some state s, then expression 'At least one of the following conditions is true: "stone1 is at location pos45", "Location pos54 is not clear"' must hold at s or at some state after s."

This means that after stone1 is at pos42, either stone1 should be at pos45 at some point, or pos54 should not be clear at some point.

Constraint 5: "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'At least one of the following conditions is true: "Location pos43 is not clear", "Location pos45 is not clear"'"

This means that at some point, pos43 or pos45 should not be clear.

With these clarifications, let's adjust our plan:

1. Player1 starts at pos53.
2. Stone1 starts at pos42. (For constraint 4, after this, we need to ensure stone1 is at pos45 or pos54 is not clear).
3. Move player1 from pos53 to pos54. (Making pos54 not clear, satisfying constraint 4).
4. Move player1 from pos54 to pos45. (Making pos45 not clear, satisfying constraint 5).
5. Move player1 from pos45 to pos35.
6. Move player1 from pos35 to pos34. (Making pos34 not clear, satisfying part of constraint 2).
7. Move player1 from pos34 to pos33.
8. Move player1 from pos33 to pos32. (Satisfying constraint 1).
9. Move player1 from pos32 to pos42.
10. Push stone1 from pos42 to pos32. (Now player1 is at pos42 and stone1 is at pos32).
11. Move player1 from pos42 to pos32. (Satisfying constraint 1 again, which is fine).
12. Move player1 from pos32 to pos33.
13. Push stone1 from pos32 to pos33. (Now player1 is at pos32 and stone1 is at pos33).
14. Move player1 from pos32 to pos23.
15. Push stone1 from pos33 to pos23. (Now player1 is at pos33 and stone1 is at pos23).
16. Move player1 from pos33 to pos24.
17. Push stone1 from pos23 to pos24. (Now player1 is at pos23 and stone1 is at pos24, satisfying constraint 6).
18. Move player1 from pos23 to pos13.
19. Push stone1 from pos24 to pos14. (Now player1 is at pos24 and stone1 is at pos14, making pos14 not clear, satisfying constraint 7).
20. Move player1 from pos24 to pos14.
21. Push stone1 from pos14 to pos13. (Now player1 is at pos14 and stone1 is at pos13, satisfying part of constraint 7).
22. Move player1 from pos14 to pos13.
23. Push stone1 from pos13 to pos12. (Now player1 is at pos13 and stone1 is at pos12).
24. Move player1 from pos13 to pos12.
25. Push stone1 from pos12 to pos11. (Now player1 is at pos12 and stone1 is at pos11, the goal).

There's one issue with step 9, though. If player1 is at pos32 and stone1 is also at pos32, they're on the same spot, which doesn't make sense. I think there's a misunderstanding somewhere.

Let's recheck the logic. I'm moving player1 to pos32 (step 8), and then trying to push stone1 from pos42 to pos32 (step 10).

To push stone1 from pos42 to pos32, player1 needs to be at pos52. But I currently have player1 at pos32.

There's a discrepancy in the way I'm planning these moves. Let me take a step back and rethink.

Actually, there's a fundamental misunderstanding in my previous plans. When player1 pushes a stone, player1 takes the stone's previous position, and the stone moves to the adjacent position in the same direction.

Let's re-plan:

1. Player1 starts at pos53.
2. Stone1 starts at pos42.
3. Move player1 from pos53 to pos43.
4. Move player1 from pos43 to pos33.
5. Move player1 from pos33 to pos32. (Satisfying constraint 1).
6. Move player1 from pos32 to pos34. (Making pos34 not clear, satisfying constraint 2).
7. Move player1 from pos34 to pos44.
8. Move player1 from pos44 to pos54. (Making pos54 not clear, satisfying constraint 4).
9. Move player1 from pos54 to pos44.
10. Move player1 from pos44 to pos43.
11. Move player1 from pos43 to pos42.
12. Push stone1 from pos42 to pos32. (Now player1 is at pos42 and stone1 is at pos32).
13. Move player1 from pos42 to pos43. (Making pos43 not clear, satisfying constraint 5).
14. Move player1 from pos43 to pos33.
15. Push stone1 from pos32 to pos22. (Now player1 is at pos32 and stone1 is at pos22).
16. Move player1 from pos32 to pos33.
17. Move player1 from pos33 to pos23.
18. Push stone1 from pos22 to pos23. (Now player1 is at pos22 and stone1 is at pos23).
19. Move player1 from pos22 to pos23.
20. Push stone1 from pos23 to pos24. (Now player1 is at pos23 and stone1 is at pos24, satisfying constraint 6).
21. Move player1 from pos23 to pos24.
22. Push stone1 from pos24 to pos14. (Now player1 is at pos24 and stone1 is at pos14, making pos14 not clear, satisfying constraint 7).
23. Move player1 from pos24 to pos14.
24. Push stone1 from pos14 to pos13. (Now player1 is at pos14 and stone1 is at pos13, satisfying part of constraint 7).
25. Move player1 from pos14 to pos13.
26. Push stone1 from pos13 to pos12. (Now player1 is at pos13 and stone1 is at pos12).
27. Move player1 from pos13 to pos12.
28. Push stone1 from pos12 to pos11. (Now player1 is at pos12 and stone1 is at pos11, the goal).

Wait, I notice another inconsistency. In steps 18 and 19, I first push stone1 from pos22 to pos23, and then move player1 from pos22 to pos23. But after the push, player1 is already at pos22, so the move seems redundant. Let me clarify:

When I push stone1 from pos22 to pos23, player1 is at pos32 (to the right of stone1 in my coordinates). After the push, stone1 is at pos23, and player1 is at pos22 (where stone1 was before).

Actually, I think I'm still getting confused with the "push" action. Let's look at the exact definition from the problem:

"pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": Make agent p, situated at location l_p, push stone s from location l_from to goal location l_to, following direction d.

The action says if player p is at position l_p and stone s is at position l_from, then the player pushes the stone from l_from to l_to.

This suggests that the player doesn't have to be directly adjacent to the stone to push it. But if that's the case, what does "following direction d" mean?

The preconditions for "pushtogoal" are:
1. agent p is at location l_p.
2. stone s is at location l_from.
3. location l_to is clear.
4. you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d.
5. you can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d.
6. location l_to is a goal location.

This clarifies things a bit. It means:
- The player has to be at a position l_p such that if you follow direction d, you'd reach the stone's position l_from.
- The stone has to be at a position l_from such that if you follow direction d, you'd reach the target position l_to.

So, to push stone1 from pos42 to pos32, player1 has to be at a position such that if you move in the direction that would push the stone to pos32, you'd be at pos42. So, player1 needs to be at pos52 (to the right of pos42).

Let's revise our understanding:

To push a stone from location A to location B in direction D, the agent needs to be at location C, such that:
- If you move from C in direction D, you'd reach A.
- If you move from A in direction D, you'd reach B.

Now, let's replan:

1. Player1 starts at pos53.
2. Stone1 starts at pos42.
3. Move player1 from pos53 to pos52. (Move right).
4. Push stone1 from pos42 to pos32 in direction "dirleft". (Now player1 is at pos42 and stone1 is at pos32).
5. Move player1 from pos42 to pos32. (Satisfying constraint 1).
6. Move player1 from pos32 to pos34. (Making pos34 not clear, satisfying constraint 2).
7. Move player1 from pos34 to pos44.
8. Move player1 from pos44 to pos54. (Making pos54 not clear, satisfying constraint 4).
9. Move player1 from pos54 to pos44.
10. Move player1 from pos44 to pos43. (Making pos43 not clear, satisfying constraint 5).
11. Move player1 from pos43 to pos33.
12. Push stone1 from pos32 to pos22 in direction "dirleft". (Now player1 is at pos32 and stone1 is at pos22).
13. Move player1 from pos32 to pos33.
14. Move player1 from pos33 to pos34.
15. Move player1 from pos34 to pos24.
16. Push stone1 from pos22 to pos24 in direction "dirdown". (Now player1 is at pos22 and stone1 is at pos24, satisfying constraint 6).
17. Move player1 from pos22 to pos24.
18. Push stone1 from pos24 to pos14 in direction "dirleft". (Now player1 is at pos24 and stone1 is at pos14, making pos14 not clear, satisfying constraint 7).
19. Move player1 from pos24 to pos14.
20. Push stone1 from pos14 to pos13 in direction "dirleft". (Now player1 is at pos14 and stone1 is at pos13, satisfying part of constraint 7).
21. Move player1 from pos14 to pos13.
22. Push stone1 from pos13 to pos12 in direction "dirleft". (Now player1 is at pos13 and stone1 is at pos12).
23. Move player1 from pos13 to pos12.
24. Push stone1 from pos12 to pos11 in direction "dirleft". (Now player1 is at pos12 and stone1 is at pos11, the goal).

But wait, I don't think the "pushtogoal" action is applicable for all these pushes, since the target locations might not be goal locations. Let's revise and use "pushtonongoal" when appropriate:

1. Player1 starts at pos53.
2. Stone1 starts at pos42.
3. Move player1 from pos53 to pos52. (Move right).
4. Pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos52 pos42 pos32 dirleft. (Now player1 is at pos42 and stone1 is at pos32).
5. Move player1 from pos42 to pos32. (Satisfying constraint 1).
6. Move player1 from pos32 to pos34. (Making pos34 not clear, satisfying constraint 2).
7. Move player1 from pos34 to pos44.
8. Move player1 from pos44 to pos54. (Making pos54 not clear, satisfying constraint 4).
9. Move player1 from pos54 to pos44.
10. Move player1 from pos44 to pos43. (Making pos43 not clear, satisfying constraint 5).
11. Move player1 from pos43 to pos33.
12. Pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos32 pos22 dirleft. (Now player1 is at pos32 and stone1 is at pos22).
13. Move player1 from pos32 to pos33.
14. Move player1 from pos33 to pos34.
15. Move player1 from pos34 to pos24.
16. Pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos22 pos24 dirdown. (Now player1 is at pos22 and stone1 is at pos24, satisfying constraint 6).

Wait, this doesn't make sense. I'm pushing stone1 from pos22 to pos24. This would mean the stone teleports, which isn't how pushing works.

Pushing a stone means the stone moves one position in the direction the agent is pushing. So, if stone1 is at pos22 and I want to push it down, it would end up at pos23 (not pos24).

Let's revise my understanding:

To push a stone, the agent needs to be in a position adjacent to the stone, pushing the stone in a specific direction. The stone moves one position in that direction.

Let's replan:

1. Player1 starts at pos53.
2. Stone1 starts at pos42.
3. Move player1 from pos53 to pos52. (Move right).
4. Pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos52 pos42 pos32 dirleft. (Stone pushed from pos42 to pos32, player1 at pos42).
5. Move player1 from pos42 to pos32. (Satisfying constraint 1).
6. Move player1 from pos32 to pos34. (Making pos34 not clear, satisfying constraint 2).
7. Move player1 from pos34 to pos44.
8. Move player1 from pos44 to pos54. (Making pos54 not clear, satisfying constraint 4).
9. Move player1 from pos54 to pos44.
10. Move player1 from pos44 to pos43. (Making pos43 not clear, satisfying constraint 5).
11. Move player1 from pos43 to pos33.
12. Pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos32 pos22 dirup. (Stone pushed from pos32 to pos22, player1 at pos32).
13. Move player1 from pos32 to pos31.
14. Move player1 from pos31 to pos21.
15. Move player1 from pos21 to pos22.
16. Pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos22 pos23 dirdown. (Stone pushed from pos22 to pos23, player1 at pos22).
17. Move player1 from pos22 to pos23.
18. Pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos23 pos24 dirdown. (Stone pushed from pos23 to pos24, player1 at pos23, satisfying constraint 6).
19. Move player1 from pos23 to pos24.
20. Pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos24 pos14 dirup. (Stone pushed from pos24 to pos14, player1 at pos24, making pos14 not clear, satisfying constraint 7).
21. Move player1 from pos24 to pos14.
22. Pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos14 pos14 pos13 dirleft. (Stone pushed from pos14 to pos13, player1 at pos14, satisfying constraint 7).
23. Move player1 from pos14 to pos13.
24. Pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos13 pos12 dirleft. (Stone pushed from pos13 to pos12, player1 at pos13).
25. Move player1 from pos13 to pos12.
26. Pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos12 pos12 pos11 dirleft. (Stone pushed from pos12 to pos11, player1 at pos12, stone1 at the goal).

I'm still making errors. Let's reflect on the preconditions for the "pushtonongoal" and "pushtogoal" actions:

For "pushtonongoal":
- agent p is at location l_p.
- stone s is at location l_from.
- location l_to is clear.
- you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d.
- you can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d.
- location l_to is not a goal location.

For "pushtogoal":
- agent p is at location l_p.
- stone s is at location l_from.
- location l_to is clear.
- you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d.
- you can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d.
- location l_to is a goal location.

So, to push a stone from l_from to l_to in direction d, the agent should be at a position l_p such that following direction d from l_p leads to l_from, and following direction d from l_from leads to l_to.

This means that to push stone1 from pos42 to pos32 in the "up" direction (assuming up is towards smaller row numbers), player1 needs to be at pos52 (below pos42).

Let's replan one more time, being more precise with the direction:

1. Player1 starts at pos53.
2. Stone1 starts at pos42.
3. Move player1 from pos53 to pos43. (Move up).
4. Move player1 from pos43 to pos33. (Move up).
5. Move player1 from pos33 to pos32. (Move left, satisfying constraint 1).
6. Move player1 from pos32 to pos33. (Move right).
7. Move player1 from pos33 to pos34. (Move right, making pos34 not clear, satisfying constraint 2).
8. Move player1 from pos34 to pos44. (Move down).
9. Move player1 from pos44 to pos54. (Move down, making pos54 not clear, satisfying constraint 4).
10. Move player1 from pos54 to pos44. (Move up).
11. Move player1 from pos44 to pos43. (Move left, making pos43 not clear, satisfying constraint 5).
12. Move player1 from pos43 to pos33. (Move up).
13. Move player1 from pos33 to pos32. (Move left).
14. Move player1 from pos32 to pos31. (Move left).
15. Move player1 from pos31 to pos41. (Move down).
16. Move player1 from pos41 to pos42. (Move right).
17. Pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos42 pos32 dirup. (Stone pushed from pos42 to pos32, player1 at pos42).

Wait, there's a logical error again. If stone1 is at pos42 and player1 is also at pos42, they can't be at the same position. This is a confusion I need to resolve.

I might be misunderstanding the problem's state. Let's reread the original state of the world:

"player1 is at location pos53"
"stone1 is at location pos42"

Starting with this, player1 can't push stone1 from pos42 without first moving from pos53 to a position adjacent to pos42.

Let's revise our understanding:

- Players and stones can't be at the same position.
- To push a stone, the player must be adjacent to the stone.
- The push direction is determined by the player's position relative to the stone.

Let's try once more:

1. Player1 starts at pos53.
2. Stone1 starts at pos42.
3. Move player1 from pos53 to pos43. (Move up).
4. Pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos42 pos41 dirleft. (Stone pushed from pos42 to pos41, player1 at pos42).
5. Move player1 from pos42 to pos32. (Move up, satisfying constraint 1).
6. Move player1 from pos32 to pos33. (Move right).
7. Move player1 from pos33 to pos34. (Move right, making pos34 not clear, satisfying constraint 2).
8. Move player1 from pos34 to pos44. (Move down).
9. Move player1 from pos44 to pos54. (Move down, making pos54 not clear, satisfying constraint 4).
10. Move player1 from pos54 to pos44. (Move up).
11. Move player1 from pos44 to pos43. (Move left, making pos43 not clear, satisfying constraint 5).
12. Move player1 from pos43 to pos33. (Move up).
13. Move player1 from pos33 to pos23. (Move up).
14. Move player1 from pos23 to pos22. (Move left).
15. Move player1 from pos22 to pos21. (Move left).
16. Move player1 from pos21 to pos31. (Move down).
17. Move player1 from pos31 to pos41. (Move down).
18. Pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos41 pos41 pos31 dirup. (Stone pushed from pos41 to pos31, player1 at pos41).
19. Move player1 from pos41 to pos31. (Move up).
20. Pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos31 pos21 dirup. (Stone pushed from pos31 to pos21, player1 at pos31).
21. Move player1 from pos31 to pos21. (Move up).
22. Pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos21 pos21 pos22 dirright. (Stone pushed from pos21 to pos22, player1 at pos21).
23. Move player1 from pos21 to pos22. (Move right).
24. Pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos22 pos23 dirright. (Stone pushed from pos22 to pos23, player1 at pos22).
25. Move player1 from pos22 to pos23. (Move right).
26. Pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos23 pos24 dirright. (Stone pushed from pos23 to pos24, player1 at pos23, satisfying constraint 6).
27. Move player1 from pos23 to pos24. (Move right).
28. Pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos24 pos14 dirup. (Stone pushed from pos24 to pos14, player1 at pos24, making pos14 not clear, satisfying constraint 7).
29. Move player1 from pos24 to pos14. (Move up).
30. Pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos14 pos14 pos13 dirleft. (Stone pushed from pos14 to pos13, player1 at pos14, satisfying constraint 7).
31. Move player1 from pos14 to pos13. (Move left).
32. Pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos13 pos12 dirleft. (Stone pushed from pos13 to pos12, player1 at pos13).
33. Move player1 from pos13 to pos12. (Move left).
34. Pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos12 pos12 pos11 dirleft. (Stone pushed from pos12 to pos11, player1 at pos12, stone1 at the goal).

Ok, I think I'm still struggling because I might be misunderstanding how the push actions work. Let's go back to the exact description of the actions:

"pushtonongoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": Make agent p, situated at location l_p, push stone s from location l_from to non-goal location l_to, following direction d.

This action has the following preconditions:
- agent p is at location l_p.
- stone s is at location l_from.
- location l_to is clear.
- you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d.
- you can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d.
- location l_to is not a goal location.

The precondition "you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d" suggests that the agent must be in a position such that if it moves in direction d, it would reach the stone's position. 

So, if stone1 is at pos42 and I want to push it left to pos41, agent p should be at a position such that moving left would put the agent at pos42. This would be pos43.

Similarly, to push the stone up from pos42 to pos32, agent p should be at a position such that moving up would put the agent at pos42. This would be pos52.

Actually I am confused because player1 is on pos53, (positioned to the right and bottom of stone1). This means player1 can move left to pos52 (directly south of pos42). Then player1 can move up to push stone1 from pos42 up to pos32. But when player1 pushes the stone, where does player1 end up? The action's effect suggests that agent p ends up at location l_from (where the stone was).

It's quite challenging to mentally visualize the grid and movements, but let's try once more.

Let's name the directions more explicitly. Assuming:
- "up" (or dirup) is moving from a higher row number to a lower row number (e.g., pos42 to pos32).
- "down" (or dirdown) is moving from a lower row number to a higher row number (e.g., pos32 to pos42).
- "left" (or dirleft) is moving from a higher column number to a lower column number (e.g., pos42 to pos41).
- "right" (or dirright) is moving from a lower column number to a higher column number (e.g., pos41 to pos42).

With this in mind, let's try one last plan:

1. Player1 starts at pos53.
2. Stone1 starts at pos42.
3. Move player1 player1 pos53 pos43 dirup. (Player goes from pos53 to pos43).
4. Move player1 player1 pos43 pos42 dirleft. (Player goes from pos43 to pos42).

Now wait, this won't work. If player1 is at pos42, then stone1 can't also be at pos42. Therefore I'm still misunderstanding how push works.

The precondition "you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d" asks if the player can move from its current position to the stone's position by following direction d. It's not saying the player has to move to the stone's position.

Let me try once more, more carefully:

1. Player1 starts at pos53.
2. Stone1 starts at pos42.
3. Move player1 player1 pos53 pos43 dirup. (Player goes from pos53 to pos43, positioned below the stone).
4. Pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos42 pos32 dirup. (Player, from pos43, pushes stone1 from pos42 to pos32 in the up direction).

Given the preconditions, this should be valid because:
- player1 is at pos43.
- stone1 is at pos42.
- pos32 is clear.
- From pos43, moving in the direction "up", you'd get to pos42 (the stone's position).
- From pos42, moving in the direction "up", you'd get to pos32.
- pos32 is not a goal location.

Now, after this action, the effects would be:
- player1 is no longer at pos43.
- stone1 is no longer at pos42.
- pos32 is no longer clear.
- player1 is at pos42 (where the stone was).
- stone1 is at pos32.
- pos43 is clear.
- stone1 is at a non-goal state.

This now seems to make more sense to me. Let me replan with this clearer understanding.

Actually, on second thought, there's ambiguity in the phrase "following direction d". Does this mean "push in direction d" or does it mean "moving in direction d will get you there"? The latter interpretation, combined with the precondition that "you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d", suggests that the direction is a constraint on the player's positioning rather than the push direction.

Let me focus on the action effects:

"pushtonongoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": After performing this action, (i) agent p is no longer at location l_p, (ii) stone s is no longer at location l_from, (iii) location l_to is no longer clear, (iv) agent p is at location l_from, (v) stone s is at location l_to, (vi) location l_p is clear, and (vi) stone s is at a non goal state.

This effect confirms that the agent moves from l_p to l_from, and the stone moves from l_from to l_to.

Given these effects and the preconditions, it seems like the direction d is meant to ensure that l_p, l_from, and l_to are in a straight line, with l_from in between l_p and l_to.

Ok I think this is the right understanding. So, for agent p to push stone s from position l_from to position l_to, agent p should be positioned at l_p such that moving in direction d would take agent p to l_from, and moving in the same direction d from l_from would take the stone to l_to.

With this understanding, the push action would look like: Pushtonongoal player1 stone1 l_p l_from l_to d.

Let's replan once more:

1. Player1 starts at pos53.
2. Stone1 starts at pos42.
3. Move player1 player1 pos53 pos43 dirup. (Player goes from pos53 to pos43, positioned below the stone).
4. Pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos42 pos32 dirup. (Player, from pos43, pushes stone1 from pos42 to pos32 in the up direction).

After this, player1 is at pos42 and stone1 is at pos32.

5. Move player1 player1 pos42 pos32 dirup. (Player goes from pos42 to pos32, satisfying constraint 1).
6. Move player1 player1 pos32 pos33 dirright. (Player goes from pos32 to pos33).
7. Move player1 player1 pos33 pos34 dirright. (Player goes from pos33 to pos34, making pos34 not clear, satisfying constraint 2).
8. Move player1 player1 pos34 pos44 dirdown. (Player goes from pos34 to pos44).
9. Move player1 player1 pos44 pos54 dirdown. (Player goes from pos44 to pos54, making pos54 not clear, satisfying constraint 4).
10. Move player1 player1 pos54 pos44 dirup. (Player goes from pos54 to pos44).
11. Move player1 player1 pos44 pos43 dirleft. (Player goes from pos44 to pos43, making pos43 not clear, satisfying constraint 5).
12. Move player1 player1 pos43 pos33 dirup. (Player goes from pos43 to pos33).
13. Pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos32 pos22 dirup. (Player, from pos33, pushes stone1 from pos32 to pos22 in the up direction).

After this, player1 is at pos32 and stone1 is at pos22.

14. Move player1 player1 pos32 pos33 dirright. (Player goes from pos32 to pos33).
15. Move player1 player1 pos33 pos23 dirup. (Player goes from pos33 to pos23).
16. Pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos22 pos21 dirleft. (Player, from pos23, pushes stone1 from pos22 to pos21 in the left direction).

After this, player1 is at pos22 and stone1 is at pos21.

17. Move player1 player1 pos22 pos23 dirright. (Player goes from pos22 to pos23).
18. Move player1 player1 pos23 pos24 dirright. (Player goes from pos23 to pos24).
19. Move player1 player1 pos24 pos25 dirright. (Player goes from pos24 to pos25).
20. Move player1 player1 pos25 pos24 dirleft. (Player goes from pos25 to pos24).
21. Move player1 player1 pos24 pos14 dirup. (Player goes from pos24 to pos14).
22. Move player1 player1 pos14 pos15 dirright. (Player goes from pos14 to pos15).
23. Move player1 player1 pos15 pos14 dirleft. (Player goes from pos15 to pos14, making pos14 not clear, satisfying constraint 7).
24. Move player1 player1 pos14 pos24 dirdown. (Player goes from pos14 to pos24).
25. Move player1 player1 pos24 pos23 dirleft. (Player goes from pos24 to pos23).
26. Move player1 player1 pos23 pos13 dirup. (Player goes from pos23 to pos13).
27. Move player1 player1 pos13 pos12 dirleft. (Player goes from pos13 to pos12).
28. Move player1 player1 pos12 pos11 dirleft. (Player goes from pos12 to pos11).
29. Move player1 player1 pos11 pos21 dirdown. (Player goes from pos11 to pos21).
30. Pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos21 pos21 pos31 dirdown. (Player, from pos21, pushes stone1 from pos21 to pos31 in the down direction).

After this, player1 is at pos21 and stone1 is at pos31.

31. Move player1 player1 pos21 pos31 dirdown. (Player goes from pos21 to pos31).
32. Pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos31 pos41 dirdown. (Player, from pos31, pushes stone1 from pos31 to pos41 in the down direction).

After this, player1 is at pos31 and stone1 is at pos41.

33. Move player1 player1 pos31 pos32 dirright. (Player goes from pos31 to pos32).
34. Move player1 player1 pos32 pos33 dirright. (Player goes from pos32 to pos33).
35. Move player1 player1 pos33 pos34 dirright. (Player goes from pos33 to pos34).
36. Move player1 player1 pos34 pos24 dirup. (Player goes from pos34 to pos24, satisfying constraint 6 since stone1 is at pos24).

Wait, stone1 is currently at pos41, not pos24. I made an error. Let's adjust:

We need to go to pos24 to satisfy the constraint "stone1 is at pos24", but stone1 is currently at pos41. We might need to push stone1 to pos24.

Since we're at pos34, let's work toward getting to pos24 and pushing stone1 there.

Actually, we seem to be straying away from the main objective, which is to get stone1 to a goal location (pos11). Let's refocus:

1. Player1 starts at pos53 and Stone1 starts at pos42.
2. Move player1 player1 pos53 pos52 dirleft. (Player goes from pos53 to pos52).
3. Move player1 player1 pos52 pos42 dirup. (Player goes from pos52 to pos42, positioned in the same position as stone1, which is an issue).

It seems that pos42 can contain either the player or the stone, but not both. Let me reconsider this problem.

Actually, let's revisit the problem:

"The world consists of a 2D square grid. Each position on the grid may contain either the agent, a stone or be empty. Each position is flagged as either a goal position or a non-goal position. Your task is to manipulate the agent in order to move all stones to goal positions."

The line "Each position on the grid may contain either the agent, a stone or be empty" explicitly states that a position can only contain one of: agent, stone, or nothing. So, it's not possible for player1 and stone1 to be at the same position.

Now, looking back at the action's effect:

"pushtonongoal p s l_p l_from l_to d" has an effect that "agent p is at location l_from" after the action. But if stone s is at location l_from, how can agent p also be at location l_from after pushing? This would put both the agent and the stone on the same position.

Let me re-read the preconditions:

For "pushtonongoal":
1. agent p is at location l_p.
2. stone s is at location l_from.
3. location l_to is clear.
4. you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d.
5. you can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d.
6. location l_to is not a goal location.

And the effects:
1. agent p is no longer at location l_p.
2. stone s is no longer at location l_from.
3. location l_to is no longer clear.
4. agent p is at location l_from.
5. stone s is at location l_to.
6. location l_p is clear.
7. stone s is at a non goal state.

So, the action involves the agent moving from l_p to l_from, and the stone moving from l_from to l_to.

Hmm, this is confusing. Let's try to reason about this in a different way.

Let's consider the grid again:

```
pos11 pos12 pos13 pos14 pos15
pos21 pos22 pos23 pos24 pos25
pos31 pos32 pos33 pos34 pos35
pos41 pos42 pos43 pos44 pos45
pos51 pos52 pos53 pos54 pos55
```

If the agent is at pos53 and the stone is at pos42, how would the agent push the stone?

According to the action description, if the agent is at position l_p and the stone is at position l_from, the agent pushes the stone from l_from to l_to. But after the push, the agent is at position l_from (where the stone was) and the stone is at position l_to.

This seems to describe a scenario where the agent and the stone are adjacent, and the agent moves into the stone's position, pushing the stone one step further in the same direction.

For instance, if the agent is at pos43 and the stone is at pos42 (they're adjacent), the agent can push the stone to pos41. After the push, the agent is at pos42 (where the stone was) and the stone is at pos41.

The preconditions "you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d" and "you can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d" ensure that the agent, stone, and destination are in a straight line, with the stone in between the agent and the destination.

According to the original state of the world, for us to move from pos53 to pos42, we'd have to move up and left. From the action description, we'd need a straight line, which isn't the case here.

So, the agent would need to move to a position adjacent to the stone, in a straight line with the destination, to push the stone.

Let's revisit the problem (ignoring the constraints for now) to see if this makes sense.

1. Player1 starts at pos53.
2. Stone1 starts at pos42.
3. Move player1 player1 pos53 pos43 dirup. (Player goes from pos53 to pos43, positioned below the stone).

Let's check the allowable movements:
- Can player1 move from pos53 to pos43? Yes, from the state of the world, "You may move from location pos53 to location pos43 following direction dirleft."

Now, let's check the preconditions for the push action:
- Pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos42 pos32 dirup.
  - player1 is at pos43. Yes.
  - stone1 is at pos42. Yes.
  - pos32 is clear. Yes.
  - Can you get from pos43 to pos42 following dirup? Yes, from the state of the world, "You may move from location pos43 to location pos42 following direction dirup."
  - Can you get from pos42 to pos32 following dirup? Yes, from the state of the world, "You may move from location pos42 to location pos32 following direction dirup."
  - pos32 is not a goal location. Yes, "pos32 is not a goal location."

So, this push action should be valid.

Wait, I just noticed that in the original state of the world, it doesn't say "You may move from location pos43 to location pos42 following direction dirup." It actually says "You may move from location pos43 to location pos33 following direction dirleft." 

This means player1 can get from pos43 to pos33 by moving left, not from pos43 to pos42 by moving up. So, the push action I was thinking of might not be valid.

Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Let's try to build this from what's explicitly given.

Actually, let's look back at the connections specified in the state of the world:

"You may move from location pos43 to location pos33 following direction dirleft."
"You may move from location pos43 to location pos42 following direction dirup."
"You may move from location pos43 to location pos44 following direction dirdown."

This contradicts what I said earlier. The world does allow player1 to move from pos43 to pos42 following direction dirup. This suggests that pos43 is below pos42, and pos33 is to the left of pos43. But then why can I move from pos43 to pos33 following direction dirleft? This suggests pos33 is to the left of pos43, not above it.

I'm confused about the interpretation of the grid. Let me try to infer the grid's coordinates from the connections:
