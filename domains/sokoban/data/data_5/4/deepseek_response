Explanation of the plan:

1. **move player1 pos53 pos43 dirleft**: The agent moves from pos53 to pos43 to position themselves next to the stone.
2. **pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos42 pos32 dirup**: The agent pushes the stone from pos42 to pos32 (non-goal), fulfilling the constraint that the agent must be at pos32 (now in pos32 after the push).
3. **move player1 pos32 pos33 dirright**: The agent moves to pos33 to reposition.
4. **move player1 pos33 pos43 dirright**: The agent moves back to pos43 to access the stone.
5. **pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos32 pos22 dirup**: The agent pushes the stone from pos32 to pos22 (non-goal), moving closer to the goal.
6. **move player1 pos22 pos12 dirleft**: The agent moves to pos12 to prepare for the final push.
7. **pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos12 pos12 pos11 dirup**: The agent pushes the stone from pos12 to pos11 (goal), achieving the final goal.

This plan ensures all constraints are met, including the agent being at pos32 and the stone passing through required positions.
