The world consists of a 2D square grid. Each position on the grid may contain either the agent, a stone or be empty. Each position is flagged as either a goal position or a non-goal position. Your task is to manipulate the agent in order to move all stones to goal positions.

The available actions are the following:
	"move p l_from l_to d": Move agent p from location l_from to location l_to following direction d.
	"pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": Make agent p, situated at location l_p, push stone s from location l_from to goal location l_to, following direction d.
	"pushtonongoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": Make agent p, situated at location l_p, push stone s from location l_from to non-goal location l_to, following direction d.

An action may only be performed if its preconditions are met.
The actions of this domain have the following preconditions:
	"move p l_from l_to d": You may only perform this action if (i) agent p is at location l_from, (ii) location l_to is clear, and (iii) you can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d.
	"pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": You may only perform this action if (i) agent p is at location l_p, (ii) stone s is at location l_from, (iii) location l_to is clear, (iv) you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d, (v) you can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d, and (vi) location l_to is a goal location.
	"pushtonongoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": You may only perform this action if (i) agent p is at location l_p, (ii) stone s is at location l_from, (iii) location l_to is clear, (iv) you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d, (v) you can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d, and (vi) location l_to is not a goal location.

The effects of an action are brought about after the action is performed.
An effect may be conditional, in the sense that it manifests only if some conditions hold.
 The actions of this domain have the following effects:
	"move p l_from l_to d": After performing this action, (i) agent p is no longer at location l_from, (ii) location l_to is no longer clear, (iii) agent p is at location l_to, and (iv) location l_from is clear.
	"pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": After performing this action, (i) agent p is no longer at location l_p, (ii) stone s is no longer at location l_from, (iii) location l_to is no longer clear, (iv) agent p is at location l_from, (v) stone s is at location l_to, (vi) location l_p is clear, and (vi) stone s is at a goal state.
	"pushtonongoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": After performing this action, (i) agent p is no longer at location l_p, (ii) stone s is no longer at location l_from, (iii) location l_to is no longer clear, (iv) agent p is at location l_from, (v) stone s is at location l_to, (vi) location l_p is clear, and (vi) stone s is at a non goal state.
