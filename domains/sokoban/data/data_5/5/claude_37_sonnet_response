Let me understand the problem carefully.

We have a 2D square grid. The grid consists of locations with positions like "posXY" where X is a row and Y is a column. So we have a 5x5 grid from pos11 to pos55.

On this grid, we have a player (player1) and a stone (stone1). The player can move and can push the stone. The goal is to get the stone to a goal location, which in this case is pos42.

Initially:
- player1 is at location pos41
- stone1 is at location pos44
- All other positions are clear (empty)
- The goal location is pos42

The available actions are:
1. "move p l_from l_to d": Move agent p from location l_from to location l_to following direction d.
2. "pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": Make agent p push stone s from a location to a goal location.
3. "pushtonongoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": Make agent p push stone s from a location to a non-goal location.

There are several constraints that the plan must satisfy:
1. player1 must be at location pos45 at some point.
2. If player1 is at location pos45, then there must be an earlier state where stone1 is at location pos41 or pos34.
3. stone1 must be at location pos22 at some point.
4. Location pos15 must be not clear (i.e., occupied) at some point.
5. player1 must be at location pos43 at some point, but only for one continuous sequence of states.
6. If player1 is at location pos43, then there must be an earlier state where either location pos53 or pos55 is not clear.

Let's first analyze these constraints and how they might affect our plan:

1. The player needs to be at pos45 at some point.
2. Before the player is at pos45, the stone must be at pos41 or pos34.
3. The stone must be at pos22 at some point.
4. Location pos15 must be occupied at some point (likely by either the player or the stone).
5. The player must be at pos43 at some point, but only for one continuous sequence.
6. Before the player is at pos43, either pos53 or pos55 must be occupied.

From these constraints, it seems like the stone will need to take a path something like pos44 -> pos34 -> ... -> pos22 -> ... -> pos42 or pos44 -> ... -> pos41 -> ... -> pos22 -> ... -> pos42.

Let's think about the plan step by step.

Initially:
- player1 is at pos41
- stone1 is at pos44

First, let's try to satisfy the constraint that the stone must be at pos22 at some point. To do this, the player will need to push the stone to pos22 from a neighboring position.

Now, to satisfy the constraint that player1 must be at pos45 and before that stone1 must be at pos41 or pos34, I think we should try to push the stone to pos34 or pos41 first, then move the player to pos45.

Let's also think about the constraint that player1 must be at pos43 at some point, and before that either pos53 or pos55 must be not clear.

And finally, to satisfy the constraint that pos15 must be not clear at some point, we probably need to move either the player or the stone to pos15.

Let's draft a high-level plan:
1. First, we need to move the player to be able to push the stone.
2. Push the stone to pos34 (satisfying part of constraint 2).
3. Move the player to pos45 (satisfying constraint 1).
4. Push the stone to pos22 (satisfying constraint 3).
5. Make sure pos15 is not clear at some point (satisfying constraint 4).
6. Ensure that pos53 or pos55 is not clear at some point, and then move the player to pos43 (satisfying constraints 5 and 6).
7. Finally, push the stone to the goal location pos42.

Now let's refine this plan step by step, considering the actual actions and their preconditions.

Step 1: First, we need to move the player to be able to push the stone.
Currently, the player is at pos41 and the stone is at pos44. The player can move up to pos42, then to pos43, and then to pos44 to be in the right position to push the stone.

Step 2: Push the stone to pos34.
From pos44, the player can push the stone to pos34.

Step 3: Move the player to pos45.
The player can move from pos34 to pos35, then to pos45.

Step 4: Push the stone to pos22.
From pos45, the player can move to various positions and eventually push the stone to pos22.

Step 5: Make sure pos15 is not clear at some point.
We can move the player to pos15 to satisfy this constraint.

Step 6: Ensure that pos53 or pos55 is not clear at some point, and then move the player to pos43.
We can move the stone to pos53 or pos55 to satisfy this constraint.

Step 7: Finally, push the stone to the goal location pos42.

Let's now refine this plan in more detail:

Actually I think the above is a bit jumbled. Let's try a clearer approach.

We have player1 at pos41 and stone1 at pos44 initially.

1. Move player1 from pos41 to pos42.
   - Action: move player1 pos41 pos42 dirdown

2. Move player1 from pos42 to pos43.
   - Action: move player1 pos42 pos43 dirdown

3. Move player1 from pos43 to pos44.
   - Action: move player1 pos43 pos44 dirdown

4. Push stone1 from pos44 to pos34 (satisfying part of constraint 2).
   - Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos44 pos34 dirleft
   - After this, player1 is at pos44 and stone1 is at pos34.

5. Move player1 from pos44 to pos45.
   - Action: move player1 pos44 pos45 dirdown
   - This satisfies constraint 1, and with stone1 at pos34, it also satisfies constraint 2.

Wait, we need to re-examine the constraints. If player1 is at pos45, there must have been an earlier state where stone1 is at pos41 or pos34. Since stone1 is currently at pos34, this satisfies constraint 2.

Oh, actually, let's clarify. After pushing stone1 from pos44 to pos34 in step 4, the player would end up at pos44. So we should continue from there.

6. Move player1 from pos44 to pos45.
   - Action: move player1 pos44 pos45 dirdown
   - This satisfies constraint 1, and with stone1 at pos34, it also satisfies constraint 2.

7. Move player1 from pos45 to pos35.
   - Action: move player1 pos45 pos35 dirleft

8. Move player1 from pos35 to pos34.
   - Action: move player1 pos35 pos34 dirup

9. Push stone1 from pos34 to pos24.
   - Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos34 pos24 dirleft
   - After this, player1 is at pos34 and stone1 is at pos24.

10. Move player1 from pos34 to pos24.
    - Action: move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft

11. Push stone1 from pos24 to pos23.
    - Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos24 pos23 dirup
    - After this, player1 is at pos24 and stone1 is at pos23.

12. Move player1 from pos24 to pos23.
    - Action: move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup

13. Push stone1 from pos23 to pos22.
    - Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos23 pos22 dirup
    - After this, player1 is at pos23 and stone1 is at pos22. This satisfies constraint 3.

Now let's check the other constraints:
- Constraint 4: "Location pos15 is not clear" at some point. We haven't satisfied this yet.
- Constraint 5 and 6: player1 must be at pos43 at some point, but only for one continuous sequence. Before that, either pos53 or pos55 must be not clear. We haven't satisfied these yet.

Let's continue from the current state:
- player1 is at pos23
- stone1 is at pos22

14. Move player1 from pos23 to pos24.
    - Action: move player1 pos23 pos24 dirdown

15. Move player1 from pos24 to pos25.
    - Action: move player1 pos24 pos25 dirdown

16. Move player1 from pos25 to pos15.
    - Action: move player1 pos25 pos15 dirleft
    - This satisfies constraint 4, as pos15 is now not clear.

Now we need to satisfy constraints 5 and 6. Before player1 is at pos43, either pos53 or pos55 must be not clear.

Let's move the player to a position where we can push the stone to pos53 or pos55.

17. Move player1 from pos15 to pos25.
    - Action: move player1 pos15 pos25 dirright

18. Move player1 from pos25 to pos35.
    - Action: move player1 pos25 pos35 dirright

19. Move player1 from pos35 to pos45.
    - Action: move player1 pos35 pos45 dirright

20. Move player1 from pos45 to pos44.
    - Action: move player1 pos45 pos44 dirup

21. Move player1 from pos44 to pos43.
    - Action: move player1 pos44 pos43 dirup

22. Move player1 from pos43 to pos33.
    - Action: move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft

23. Move player1 from pos33 to pos32.
    - Action: move player1 pos33 pos32 dirup

24. Move player1 from pos32 to pos22.
    - Action: move player1 pos32 pos22 dirleft

25. Push stone1 from pos22 to pos32.
    - Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos22 pos32 dirright
    - After this, player1 is at pos22 and stone1 is at pos32.

26. Move player1 from pos22 to pos32.
    - Action: move player1 pos22 pos32 dirright

27. Push stone1 from pos32 to pos42.
    - Action: pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos32 pos42 dirright
    - After this, player1 is at pos32 and stone1 is at pos42.

But we're missing constraints 5 and 6. Let's backtrack.

OK let's rethink this more carefully.

Let's see what we need to ensure:
1. player1 must be at location pos45 at some point.
2. If player1 is at location pos45, then there must be an earlier state where stone1 is at location pos41 or pos34.
3. stone1 must be at location pos22 at some point.
4. Location pos15 must be not clear (i.e., occupied) at some point.
5. player1 must be at location pos43 at some point, but only for one continuous sequence of states.
6. If player1 is at location pos43, then there must be an earlier state where either location pos53 or pos55 is not clear.

Initially:
- player1 is at location pos41
- stone1 is at location pos44

Let's approach this step by step, and satisfy each constraint in order.

First, let's satisfy the constraint that the stone must be at pos34 or pos41 before the player is at pos45.

1. Move player1 from pos41 to pos42.
   - Action: move player1 pos41 pos42 dirdown

2. Move player1 from pos42 to pos43.
   - Action: move player1 pos42 pos43 dirdown
   - But wait, this will occupy pos43, and according to constraint 5, player1 must be at pos43 at some point, but only for one continuous sequence of states. Let's hold off on this action for now.

Actually, hold on. I need to satisfy constraint 6 before I move player1 to pos43. Constraint 6 says that if player1 is at pos43, then there must be an earlier state where either pos53 or pos55 is not clear.

So I need to first move the stone to either pos53 or pos55.

Let's rethink this.

I could try:
1. Push the stone from pos44 to pos54.
2. Push the stone from pos54 to pos53 or pos55.
3. Move the player to pos43. (This will satisfy constraints 5 and 6).
4. Then satisfy the other constraints.

Let's try:

1. Move player1 from pos41 to pos42.
   - Action: move player1 pos41 pos42 dirdown

2. Move player1 from pos42 to pos43.
   - Action: move player1 pos42 pos43 dirdown

3. Move player1 from pos43 to pos44.
   - Action: move player1 pos43 pos44 dirdown

4. Push stone1 from pos44 to pos54.
   - Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos44 pos54 dirright
   - After this, player1 is at pos44 and stone1 is at pos54.

5. Move player1 from pos44 to pos54.
   - Action: move player1 pos44 pos54 dirright

6. Push stone1 from pos54 to pos55.
   - Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos54 pos54 pos55 dirdown
   - After this, player1 is at pos54 and stone1 is at pos55.
   - This satisfies the part of constraint 6 that says there must be an earlier state where pos55 is not clear.

7. Move player1 from pos54 to pos44.
   - Action: move player1 pos54 pos44 dirleft

8. Move player1 from pos44 to pos43.
   - Action: move player1 pos44 pos43 dirup
   - This satisfies constraint 5 and 6 (since pos55 is not clear in an earlier state).

Now we need to:
1. Ensure stone1 is at pos34 or pos41 before player1 is at pos45.
2. Ensure stone1 is at pos22 at some point.
3. Ensure pos15 is not clear at some point.
4. Finally, get stone1 to the goal location pos42.

Let's continue from the current state:
- player1 is at pos43
- stone1 is at pos55

9. Move player1 from pos43 to pos44.
   - Action: move player1 pos43 pos44 dirdown

10. Move player1 from pos44 to pos45.
    - Action: move player1 pos44 pos45 dirdown

11. Move player1 from pos45 to pos55.
    - Action: move player1 pos45 pos55 dirright

12. Push stone1 from pos55 to pos45.
    - Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos55 pos55 pos45 dirleft
    - After this, player1 is at pos55 and stone1 is at pos45.

13. Move player1 from pos55 to pos45.
    - Action: move player1 pos55 pos45 dirleft

14. Push stone1 from pos45 to pos35.
    - Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos45 pos45 pos35 dirleft
    - After this, player1 is at pos45 and stone1 is at pos35.

Hmm, this isn't working out well because I've already moved the player to pos45 in step 10, but at that point, the stone wasn't at pos34 or pos41 as required by constraint 2.

Let's backtrack and try a different approach.

Let's start over.

Initially:
- player1 is at location pos41
- stone1 is at location pos44

1. Move player1 from pos41 to pos42.
   - Action: move player1 pos41 pos42 dirdown

2. Move player1 from pos42 to pos43.
   - Action: move player1 pos42 pos43 dirdown

3. Move player1 from pos43 to pos53.
   - Action: move player1 pos43 pos53 dirright

4. Move player1 from pos53 to pos54.
   - Action: move player1 pos53 pos54 dirdown

5. Move player1 from pos54 to pos55.
   - Action: move player1 pos54 pos55 dirdown

Now pos55 is not clear because the player is there.

6. Move player1 from pos55 to pos54.
   - Action: move player1 pos55 pos54 dirup

7. Move player1 from pos54 to pos44.
   - Action: move player1 pos54 pos44 dirleft

8. Push stone1 from pos44 to pos34.
   - Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos44 pos34 dirleft
   - After this, player1 is at pos44 and stone1 is at pos34.
   - This will help satisfy constraint 2.

9. Move player1 from pos44 to pos45.
   - Action: move player1 pos44 pos45 dirdown
   - This satisfies constraint 1, and with stone1 at pos34, it also satisfies constraint 2.

10. Move player1 from pos45 to pos35.
    - Action: move player1 pos45 pos35 dirleft

11. Move player1 from pos35 to pos25.
    - Action: move player1 pos35 pos25 dirleft

12. Move player1 from pos25 to pos15.
    - Action: move player1 pos25 pos15 dirleft
    - This satisfies constraint 4, as pos15 is now not clear.

13. Move player1 from pos15 to pos25.
    - Action: move player1 pos15 pos25 dirright

14. Move player1 from pos25 to pos24.
    - Action: move player1 pos25 pos24 dirup

15. Move player1 from pos24 to pos34.
    - Action: move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright

16. Push stone1 from pos34 to pos24.
    - Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos34 pos24 dirleft
    - After this, player1 is at pos34 and stone1 is at pos24.

17. Move player1 from pos34 to pos24.
    - Action: move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft

18. Push stone1 from pos24 to pos23.
    - Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos24 pos23 dirup
    - After this, player1 is at pos24 and stone1 is at pos23.

19. Move player1 from pos24 to pos23.
    - Action: move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup

20. Push stone1 from pos23 to pos22.
    - Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos23 pos22 dirup
    - After this, player1 is at pos23 and stone1 is at pos22.
    - This satisfies constraint 3.

21. Move player1 from pos23 to pos33.
    - Action: move player1 pos23 pos33 dirright

Now at this point, pos55 is clear (not satisfying constraint 6) and we haven't moved the player to pos43 (not satisfying constraint 5).

Let's fix this. We need to make sure that either pos53 or pos55 is not clear before player1 is at pos43.

Let's try a different approach from where we are:
- player1 is at pos33
- stone1 is at pos22

22. Move player1 from pos33 to pos43.
    - Action: move player1 pos33 pos43 dirright
    - This satisfies constraint 5, but it doesn't satisfy constraint 6 because neither pos53 nor pos55 is not clear.

Let me revisit constraint 6. It says "If player1 is at pos43, then there must be an earlier state where either pos53 or pos55 is not clear." This means we need to move either the player or the stone to pos53 or pos55 before the player is at pos43.

Let's backtrack and try again.

Actually, let's look at all the constraints again and then make the plan:

1. player1 must be at location pos45 at some point.
2. If player1 is at location pos45, then there must be an earlier state where stone1 is at location pos41 or pos34.
3. stone1 must be at location pos22 at some point.
4. Location pos15 must be not clear (i.e., occupied) at some point.
5. player1 must be at location pos43 at some point, but only for one continuous sequence of states.
6. If player1 is at location pos43, then there must be an earlier state where either location pos53 or pos55 is not clear.

So, we need to:
- Move stone1 to pos34 or pos41
- Move player1 to pos45
- Move stone1 to pos22
- Make pos15 not clear at some point
- Make pos53 or pos55 not clear at some point
- Move player1 to pos43
- Finally, move stone1 to pos42

Let's look at this from a higher level. My insight is that we want to do steps 1-4 as we navigate from our initial state to the goal. We ensure all of these constraints are met, and finally pushing the stone to the goal location.

OK, let's try this:

1. First, we move the stone to pos41 (satisfying condition for constraint 2).
2. Then we move the player to pos45 (satisfying constraint 1).
3. Then we move the stone to pos22 (satisfying constraint 3).
4. At some point, we ensure pos15 is not clear (satisfying constraint 4).
5. At some point, we ensure pos53 or pos55 is not clear (condition for constraint 6).
6. Then we move the player to pos43 (satisfying constraint 5).
7. Finally, we move the stone to pos42.

Let's implement this plan.

Initially:
- player1 is at location pos41
- stone1 is at location pos44

1. Move player1 from pos41 to pos42.
   - Action: move player1 pos41 pos42 dirdown
   - Now player1 is at pos42 and stone1 is at pos44.

2. Move player1 from pos42 to pos43.
   - Action: move player1 pos42 pos43 dirdown
   - Now player1 is at pos43 and stone1 is at pos44.
   - Remember, we can only be at pos43 for one continuous sequence of states (constraint 5).

3. Move player1 from pos43 to pos44.
   - Action: move player1 pos43 pos44 dirdown
   - Now player1 is at pos44 and stone1 is at pos44 (this shouldn't be possible, I've made a mistake).

Let me reconsider the initial state:
- player1 is at location pos41
- stone1 is at location pos44

From the provided preconditions for the "pushtogoal" and "pushtonongoal" actions, I see that I need to correctly position the player to push the stone. The player needs to be adjacent to the stone in the opposite direction of the push.

So for example, if I want to push the stone from pos44 to pos34 (moving left), the player needs to be at pos54 (to the right of the stone).

Let's account for this:

1. Move player1 from pos41 to pos42.
   - Action: move player1 pos41 pos42 dirdown
   - Now player1 is at pos42 and stone1 is at pos44.

2. Move player1 from pos42 to pos43.
   - Action: move player1 pos42 pos43 dirdown
   - Now player1 is at pos43 and stone1 is at pos44.

3. Move player1 from pos43 to pos53.
   - Action: move player1 pos43 pos53 dirright
   - Now player1 is at pos53 and stone1 is at pos44.

4. Move player1 from pos53 to pos54.
   - Action: move player1 pos53 pos54 dirdown
   - Now player1 is at pos54 and stone1 is at pos44.

5. Push stone1 from pos44 to pos34.
   - Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos54 pos44 pos34 dirleft
   - After this, player1 is at pos44 and stone1 is at pos34.
   - This will help satisfy constraint 2.

Wait, I'm making an error with my understanding of how the "pushtonongoal" action works. Let's double check its preconditions:

"pushtonongoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": You may only perform this action if (i) agent p is at location l_p, (ii) stone s is at location l_from, (iii) location l_to is clear, (iv) you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d, (v) you can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d, and (vi) location l_to is not a goal location.

So the agent must be at a location where, by following direction d, they can reach the stone. And from the stone's position, by following the same direction d, we can reach the destination.

For example, if I want to push the stone from pos44 to pos34 (moving left), the player needs to be at pos54, and the direction is dirleft. By following dirleft from pos54, the player reaches pos44 (the stone's location). And by following dirleft from pos44, we reach pos34 (the destination).

OK, let's try this again:

1. Move player1 from pos41 to pos42.
   - Action: move player1 pos41 pos42 dirdown
   - Now player1 is at pos42 and stone1 is at pos44.

2. Move player1 from pos42 to pos43.
   - Action: move player1 pos42 pos43 dirdown
   - Now player1 is at pos43 and stone1 is at pos44.

Wait, but this doesn't satisfy constraint 6. We need to have an earlier state where either pos53 or pos55 is not clear before player1 is at pos43.

Let's backtrack again.

Constraint 6 says: "If player1 is at location pos43, then there must be an earlier state where either location pos53 or pos55 is not clear."

This means before player1 is at pos43, we need to ensure that either pos53 or pos55 is not clear. We can do this by either moving the player to pos53 or pos55, or by moving the stone to pos53 or pos55.

Let's try to first move the player to pos53, then to pos43:

1. Move player1 from pos41 to pos51.
   - Action: move player1 pos41 pos51 dirright
   - Now player1 is at pos51 and stone1 is at pos44.

2. Move player1 from pos51 to pos52.
   - Action: move player1 pos51 pos52 dirdown
   - Now player1 is at pos52 and stone1 is at pos44.

3. Move player1 from pos52 to pos53.
   - Action: move player1 pos52 pos53 dirdown
   - Now player1 is at pos53 and stone1 is at pos44.
   - Now pos53 is not clear, which will help satisfy constraint 6.

4. Move player1 from pos53 to pos43.
   - Action: move player1 pos53 pos43 dirleft
   - Now player1 is at pos43 and stone1 is at pos44.
   - This satisfies constraint 5 and 6.

Now we need to:
1. Move the stone to pos34 or pos41
2. Move the player to pos45
3. Move the stone to pos22
4. Make pos15 not clear at some point
5. Finally, move the stone to pos42

Let's continue from where we are:
- player1 is at pos43
- stone1 is at pos44

5. Push stone1 from pos44 to pos34.
   - Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos44 pos34 dirleft
   - After this, player1 is at pos44 and stone1 is at pos34.
   - This will help satisfy constraint 2.

6. Move player1 from pos44 to pos45.
   - Action: move player1 pos44 pos45 dirdown
   - Now player1 is at pos45 and stone1 is at pos34.
   - This satisfies constraint 1, and with stone1 at pos34, it also satisfies constraint 2.

7. Move player1 from pos45 to pos35.
   - Action: move player1 pos45 pos35 dirleft
   - Now player1 is at pos35 and stone1 is at pos34.

8. Move player1 from pos35 to pos25.
   - Action: move player1 pos35 pos25 dirleft
   - Now player1 is at pos25 and stone1 is at pos34.

9. Move player1 from pos25 to pos15.
   - Action: move player1 pos25 pos15 dirleft
   - Now player1 is at pos15 and stone1 is at pos34.
   - This satisfies constraint 4, as pos15 is now not clear.

10. Move player1 from pos15 to pos25.
    - Action: move player1 pos15 pos25 dirright
    - Now player1 is at pos25 and stone1 is at pos34.

11. Move player1 from pos25 to pos24.
    - Action: move player1 pos25 pos24 dirup
    - Now player1 is at pos24 and stone1 is at pos34.

12. Move player1 from pos24 to pos34.
    - Action: move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright
    - Now player1 is at pos34 and stone1 is at pos34.

Wait, that's not possible. The player can't be at the same position as the stone. I'm making an error in my planning.

Let's be more careful. When pushing the stone, the player ends up at the stone's original position, and the stone ends up at the destination.

So after pushing the stone from pos44 to pos34 in step 5, the player would be at pos44 and the stone would be at pos34.

Let's correct and continue:

5. Push stone1 from pos44 to pos34.
   - Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos44 pos34 dirleft
   - After this, player1 is at pos44 and stone1 is at pos34.
   - This will help satisfy constraint 2.

6. Move player1 from pos44 to pos45.
   - Action: move player1 pos44 pos45 dirdown
   - Now player1 is at pos45 and stone1 is at pos34.
   - This satisfies constraint 1, and with stone1 at pos34, it also satisfies constraint 2.

7. Move player1 from pos45 to pos35.
   - Action: move player1 pos45 pos35 dirleft
   - Now player1 is at pos35 and stone1 is at pos34.

8. Move player1 from pos35 to pos25.
   - Action: move player1 pos35 pos25 dirleft
   - Now player1 is at pos25 and stone1 is at pos34.

9. Move player1 from pos25 to pos15.
   - Action: move player1 pos25 pos15 dirleft
   - Now player1 is at pos15 and stone1 is at pos34.
   - This satisfies constraint 4, as pos15 is now not clear.

10. Move player1 from pos15 to pos25.
    - Action: move player1 pos15 pos25 dirright
    - Now player1 is at pos25 and stone1 is at pos34.

11. Move player1 from pos25 to pos24.
    - Action: move player1 pos25 pos24 dirup
    - Now player1 is at pos24 and stone1 is at pos34.

12. Move player1 from pos24 to pos34.
    - Action: move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright
    - This is not possible, since the stone is at pos34.

Alright, let me be more careful with the stone's and player's positions. We left off with:
- player1 is at pos25
- stone1 is at pos34

11. Move player1 from pos25 to pos35.
    - Action: move player1 pos25 pos35 dirright
    - Now player1 is at pos35 and stone1 is at pos34.

12. Push stone1 from pos34 to pos24.
    - Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos35 pos34 pos24 dirleft
    - After this, player1 is at pos34 and stone1 is at pos24.

13. Move player1 from pos34 to pos24.
    - Action: move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft
    - Now player1 is at pos24 and stone1 is at pos24.

No wait, that's not possible. Let me be more careful with the positions. After step 12, player1 is at pos34 and stone1 is at pos24.

13. Move player1 from pos34 to pos24.
    - Action: move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft
    - This is not possible because the stone is at pos24.

So instead, let's try:

13. Move player1 from pos34 to pos33.
    - Action: move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup
    - Now player1 is at pos33 and stone1 is at pos24.

14. Move player1 from pos33 to pos23.
    - Action: move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft
    - Now player1 is at pos23 and stone1 is at pos24.

15. Push stone1 from pos24 to pos23.
    - Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos24 pos23 dirleft
    - This is not possible, since the player is already at pos23.

Let me clarify the preconditions for the "pushtonongoal" action. The player must be at a location where, by following direction d, they can reach the stone. And from the stone's position, by following the same direction d, we can reach the destination.

So, if we want to push the stone from pos24 to pos23, the player must be at pos25 and the direction is dirleft.

Let's correct the previous steps:

13. Move player1 from pos34 to pos24.
    - Action: move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft
    - This is not possible because the stone is at pos24.

So, let's try a different approach. After step 12, player1 is at pos34 and stone1 is at pos24.

13. Move player1 from pos34 to pos33.
    - Action: move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup
    - Now player1 is at pos33 and stone1 is at pos24.

14. Move player1 from pos33 to pos23.
    - Action: move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft
    - Now player1 is at pos23 and stone1 is at pos24.

Wait, no. The precondition (iv) for "pushtonongoal" says "you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d." So if we want to push the stone from pos24 to pos23, and the direction is dirleft, then by following dirleft from the player's position, we should reach pos24. This means the player should be at pos25.

Let me rethink step by step.

After step 12, player1 is at pos34 and stone1 is at pos24.

13. Move player1 from pos34 to pos33.
    - Action: move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup
    - Now player1 is at pos33 and stone1 is at pos24.

14. Move player1 from pos33 to pos23.
    - Action: move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft
    - Now player1 is at pos23 and stone1 is at pos24.

15. Move player1 from pos23 to pos13.
    - Action: move player1 pos23 pos13 dirleft
    - Now player1 is at pos13 and stone1 is at pos24.

16. Move player1 from pos13 to pos14.
    - Action: move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown
    - Now player1 is at pos14 and stone1 is at pos24.

17. Move player1 from pos14 to pos24.
    - Action: move player1 pos14 pos24 dirright
    - This is not possible because the stone is already at pos24.

I'm getting confused by trying to do this step by step. Let me take a broader view and think about how to get the stone to pos22.

We are currently at:
- player1 is at pos34
- stone1 is at pos24

To move the stone to pos22, we need to push it from pos24 to pos23, and then from pos23 to pos22.

Let's use the "pushtonongoal" action:
For "pushtonongoal p s l_p l_from l_to d", we need:
- Agent p is at location l_p (player1 is at pos34)
- Stone s is at location l_from (stone1 is at pos24)
- Location l_to is clear (pos23 should be clear, which it is)
- You can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d (from pos34 to pos24 following dirleft)
- You can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d (from pos24 to pos23 following dirleft)
- Location l_to is not a goal location (pos23 is not a goal location)

So, we can push the stone from pos24 to pos23 by:
13. Push stone1 from pos24 to pos23:
    - Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos24 pos23 dirleft
    - After this, player1 is at pos24 and stone1 is at pos23.

Next, to move the stone from pos23 to pos22, we need to:
14. Push stone1 from pos23 to pos22:
    - Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos23 pos22 dirleft
    - After this, player1 is at pos23 and stone1 is at pos22.
    - This satisfies constraint 3.

Now, we need to get the stone to the goal location pos42.

Let's see where we are right now:
- player1 is at pos23
- stone1 is at pos22

15. Move player1 from pos23 to pos33.
    - Action: move player1 pos23 pos33 dirright
    - Now player1 is at pos33 and stone1 is at pos22.

16. Move player1 from pos33 to pos32.
    - Action: move player1 pos33 pos32 dirup
    - Now player1 is at pos32 and stone1 is at pos22.

17. Push stone1 from pos22 to pos32.
    - Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos22 pos32 dirright
    - After this, player1 is at pos22 and stone1 is at pos32.

18. Move player1 from pos22 to pos32.
    - Action: move player1 pos22 pos32 dirright
    - Now player1 is at pos32 and stone1 is at pos32.

That's not possible. Let me be more careful. After step 17, player1 is at pos22 and stone1 is at pos32.

18. Move player1 from pos22 to pos32.
    - Action: move player1 pos22 pos32 dirright
    - This is not possible because the stone is already at pos32.

Let's rethink this. After step 17, player1 is at pos22 and stone1 is at pos32.

18. Move player1 from pos22 to pos23.
    - Action: move player1 pos22 pos23 dirdown
    - Now player1 is at pos23 and stone1 is at pos32.

19. Move player1 from pos23 to pos33.
    - Action: move player1 pos23 pos33 dirright
    - Now player1 is at pos33 and stone1 is at pos32.

20. Push stone1 from pos32 to pos42.
    - Action: pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos32 pos42 dirright
    - After this, player1 is at pos32 and stone1 is at pos42.
    - This should satisfy our goal of getting the stone to the goal location pos42.

Now, all constraints have been satisfied, and the stone is at the goal location. This should be a valid plan.

But hold on, let me check if all constraints are actually satisfied:

1. ✓ player1 is at location pos45 at some point (step 6).
2. ✓ If player1 is at location pos45, then there is an earlier state where stone1 is at location pos41 or pos34 (step 5 puts stone1 at pos34, and then step 6 puts player1 at pos45).
3. ✓ stone1 is at location pos22 at some point (step 14).
4. ✓ Location pos15 is not clear at some point (step 9).
5. ✓ player1 is at location pos43 at some point, but only for one continuous sequence of states (step 4).
6. ✓ If player1 is at location pos43, then there is an earlier state where either location pos53 or pos55 is not clear (step 3 makes pos53 not clear, and then step 4 puts player1 at pos43).

So, it looks like all constraints are satisfied, and the stone is at the goal location. This should be a valid plan.

Let's provide the step-by-step plan:

1. Move player1 from pos41 to pos51 using dirright
2. Move player1 from pos51 to pos52 using dirdown
3. Move player1 from pos52 to pos53 using dirdown
4. Move player1 from pos53 to pos43 using dirleft
5. Push stone1 from pos44 to pos34 using player1 at pos43, following direction dirleft
6. Move player1 from pos44 to pos45 using dirdown
7. Move player1 from pos45 to pos35 using dirleft
8. Move player1 from pos35 to pos25 using dirleft
9. Move player1 from pos25 to pos15 using dirleft
10. Move player1 from pos15 to pos25 using dirright
11. Move player1 from pos25 to pos35 using dirright
12. Push stone1 from pos34 to pos24 using player1 at pos35, following direction dirleft
13. Push stone1 from pos24 to pos23 using player1 at pos24, following direction dirleft
14. Push stone1 from pos23 to pos22 using player1 at pos23, following direction dirleft
15. Move player1 from pos22 to pos23 using dirdown
16. Move player1 from pos23 to pos33 using dirright
17. Move player1 from pos33 to pos32 using dirup
18. Push stone1 from pos22 to pos32 using player1 at pos32, following direction dirright
19. Move player1 from pos22 to pos23 using dirdown
20. Move player1 from pos23 to pos33 using dirright
21. Push stone1 from pos32 to pos42 using player1 at pos33, following direction dirright

Actually, in step 18, I mistakenly said that the player is pushing the stone from pos22, but at that point, the player is at pos32 and the stone is at pos22. Let me correct that.

From step 17, we have:
- player1 is at pos32
- stone1 is at pos22

18. Push stone1 from pos22 to pos32.
    - Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos22 pos32 dirright
    - I realize now that the player and the destination are at the same position, which is not possible. Let me rethink.

Actually, the player needs to be in a position where, by following the direction of the push, they can reach the stone. For a push right, the player needs to be to the left of the stone. So in this case, the player would need to be at pos12 to push the stone from pos22 to pos32 in the right direction.

Let's correct the previous steps. From step 17, we have:
- player1 is at pos33
- stone1 is at pos22

18. Move player1 from pos33 to pos23.
    - Action: move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft
    - Now player1 is at pos23 and stone1 is at pos22.

19. Move player1 from pos23 to pos13.
    - Action: move player1 pos23 pos13 dirleft
    - Now player1 is at pos13 and stone1 is at pos22.

20. Move player1 from pos13 to pos12.
    - Action: move player1 pos13 pos12 dirup
    - Now player1 is at pos12 and stone1 is at pos22.

21. Push stone1 from pos22 to pos32.
    - Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos12 pos22 pos32 dirright
    - After this, player1 is at pos22 and stone1 is at pos32.

22. Move player1 from pos22 to pos32.
    - Action: move player1 pos22 pos32 dirright
    - This won't work, since the stone is at pos32.

Actually, I'm confused about how the player can push the stone from the constraint:

"pushtonongoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": You may only perform this action if (i) agent p is at location l_p, (ii) stone s is at location l_from, (iii) location l_to is clear, (iv) you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d, (v) you can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d, and (vi) location l_to is not a goal location.

From this, for "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos12 pos22 pos32 dirright", the constraint (iv) says "you can get from location pos12 to location pos22 following direction dirright". But in the provided map, you get from pos12 to pos22 by following dirright, not dirdown.

Let me double check the state of the world and see if I can find the correct transitions:

"You may move from location pos12 to location pos22 following direction dirright"

So it seems dirright is the correct direction for getting from pos12 to pos22. So the push direction is also dirright to move from pos22 to pos32. That makes sense.

Let's continue from here. After step 21, player1 is at pos22 and stone1 is at pos32.

22. Move player1 from pos22 to pos32.
    - Action: move player1 pos22 pos32 dirright
    - This won't work, since the stone is at pos32.

Let's try:

22. Move player1 from pos22 to pos23.
    - Action: move player1 pos22 pos23 dirdown
    - Now player1 is at pos23 and stone1 is at pos32.

23. Move player1 from pos23 to pos33.
    - Action: move player1 pos23 pos33 dirright
    - Now player1 is at pos33 and stone1 is at pos32.

24. Push stone1 from pos32 to pos42.
    - Action: pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos32 pos42 dirright
    - After this, player1 is at pos32 and stone1 is at pos42.
    - This should complete the task, as the stone is now at the goal location.

This should be the correct plan.

1. Move player1 from pos41 to pos51 using dirright
2. Move player1 from pos51 to pos52 using dirdown
3. Move player1 from pos52 to pos53 using dirdown
4. Move player1 from pos53 to pos43 using dirleft
5. Push stone1 from pos44 to pos34 using player1 at pos43, following direction dirleft
6. Move player1 from pos44 to pos45 using dirdown
7. Move player1 from pos45 to pos35 using dirleft
8. Move player1 from pos35 to pos25 using dirleft
9. Move player1 from pos25 to pos15 using dirleft
10. Move player1 from pos15 to pos25 using dirright
11. Move player1 from pos25 to pos35 using dirright
12. Push stone1 from pos34 to pos24 using player1 at pos35, following direction dirleft
13. Push stone1 from pos24 to pos23 using player1 at pos24, following direction dirleft
14. Push stone1 from pos23 to pos22 using player1 at pos23, following direction dirleft
15. Move player1 from pos22 to pos12 using dirleft
16. Push stone1 from pos22 to pos32 using player1 at pos12, following direction dirright
17. Move player1 from pos22 to pos23 using dirdown
18. Move player1 from pos23 to pos33 using dirright
19. Push stone1 from pos32 to pos42 using player1 at pos33, following direction dirright
