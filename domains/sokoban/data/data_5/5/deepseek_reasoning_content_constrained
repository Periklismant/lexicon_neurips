Okay, let's try to figure out this planning problem. The goal is to get stone1 to a goal location, and there are several constraints we need to satisfy. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the initial state: the agent (player1) is at pos41, and stone1 is at pos44. The goal is to have stone1 at a goal location. From the problem description, I see that pos42 is the only goal location mentioned. Wait, no, looking back: the original state says "pos42 is a goal location" and all others are not. So the goal is to get stone1 to pos42. But wait, the final goal is "stone1 is at a goal location," and pos42 is the only goal location. So that's the target.

But there are constraints that must be met. Let's list them:

1. At least once, player1 must be at pos45. But when that happens, there must have been a previous state where stone1 was at pos41 or pos34.
2. At least once, stone1 must be at pos22.
3. At least once, pos15 must not be clear (so something is there, either the agent or a stone).
4. The agent being at pos43 can happen in at most one continuous sequence (so maybe they can't stay there for multiple steps without leaving in between) and must happen at least once. Also, when the agent is at pos43, there must have been a previous state where pos53 or pos55 is not clear. But initially, all locations except pos41 (agent) and pos44 (stone1) are clear. So pos53 and pos55 are clear initially, so to make them not clear, the agent or stone must move there. But stone1 starts at pos44. So maybe we need to move the stone or the agent to pos53 or pos55 before getting to pos43.

Hmm, this is complex. Let's outline the steps needed.

First, the main goal: get stone1 to pos42. But we have to pass through certain states.

Constraints:

- Stone1 must be at pos22 at some point. So we need to move it from pos44 to pos22, then maybe to pos42. But how?

Wait, how can we move the stone? The agent can push stones using the pushtogoal or pushtonongoal actions. Let's recall the movement directions.

The movement between positions is defined. Let's try to find a path from pos44 (stone's initial position) to pos42 (goal). But also, the stone needs to be at pos22 at some point.

Wait, pos44 is in row 4, column 4. Pos42 is row4, column2. So to move from pos44 to pos42, the stone would need to go left twice. But moving left from pos44 would go to pos34 (since moving left from pos44 is direction dirleft, which connects to pos34 according to the "You may move from location pos44 to location pos34 following direction dirleft"). Then from pos34, moving left would go to pos24. But that's not towards pos42. Hmm, maybe there's a different path.

Alternatively, perhaps moving the stone up from pos44. Let me check the movement possibilities. From pos44, possible directions: dirleft (to pos34), dirright (to pos54), dirup (to pos43), dirdown (to pos45). Wait, according to the movement rules, pos44 can move up to pos43? Let me check: "You may move from location pos44 to location pos43 following direction dirup". Yes. So the agent can move up/down, left/right based on the grid connections.

So to get the stone from pos44 to pos42, maybe the agent needs to push it up to pos43, then left to pos33, then left to pos23, then left to pos22. But wait, pos22 is a required state. Then from pos22, the stone can be pushed down to pos32, then right to pos42? But pos42 is the goal. Let me check the directions.

Wait, pos22 is connected to pos32 (right direction: "You may move from location pos22 to location pos32 following direction dirright"). So if the stone is at pos22, the agent could push it right to pos32. Then from pos32, pushing right would take it to pos42. Because pos32's right direction is to pos42: "You may move from location pos32 to location pos42 following direction dirright". So that's a possible path.

But how to get the stone from pos44 to pos22. Let's see:

Stone starts at pos44. To get to pos22, possible path: pos44 -> pos34 (left), then pos34 -> pos24 (left), pos24 -> pos23 (up?), wait, no. Let's see the movement options.

Wait, the movement directions are a bit more complex. Let me map out possible movements for the stone.

But the stone can only be pushed by the agent. So the agent needs to be adjacent to the stone in the direction of movement. For example, to push the stone left, the agent must be to the right of the stone.

Let me consider the initial position: agent at pos41, stone at pos44. The agent is at row4, column1; stone is at row4, column4. So they are in the same row, columns 1 and 4.

Agent needs to reach the stone. How?

From pos41, possible moves: left to pos31, right to pos51, or down to pos42. But initially, pos42 is clear. So the agent can move down to pos42. Then from pos42, maybe move down to pos43? Wait, pos42's down direction is to pos43: "You may move from location pos42 to location pos43 following direction dirdown". So agent can go from pos42 to pos43.

But the stone is at pos44. So from pos43, the agent could push the stone down to pos45 (using pushtonongoal since pos45 is not a goal), but that might not help. Alternatively, push it up to pos43 (but the stone is at pos44, so pushing up from pos44 would require the agent to be at pos44's down direction (pos45) and push up, but that's not possible. Wait, no. The agent can push the stone in a direction if the agent is adjacent in that direction. Wait, no. The pushtogoal action requires that the agent is at l_p, which is adjacent to l_from (the stone's current location), and the direction from l_p to l_from is d. Then the stone moves from l_from to l_to, which is in direction d from l_from.

Wait, the action structure is:

"pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": the agent is at l_p, the stone is at l_from. The direction from l_p to l_from is d. So for example, if the agent is to the left of the stone, direction dirright would be from agent's position to the stone's position. Then, the stone is pushed in direction d (same direction) to l_to. So l_to is the next cell in direction d from l_from.

So to push the stone to the right, the agent must be to the left of the stone, and direction dirright. Then the stone moves from l_from to l_to (right of l_from).

So, in the initial state, the agent is at pos41. To reach the stone at pos44, the agent needs to move through the grid. Let's plan the path.

Possible path for agent:

pos41 → pos42 (down) → pos43 (down) → pos44 (right? Wait, from pos43, moving down would be to pos44. Because "You may move from location pos43 to location pos44 following direction dirdown". Wait, no, direction dirdown would be to the cell below. Wait, in a grid, directions might be a bit confusing. Let me check the movement directions again.

Looking at the connections:

For pos43: "You may move from location pos43 to location pos33 following direction dirleft", "You may move from location pos43 to location pos53 following direction dirright", "You may move from location pos43 to location pos42 following direction dirup", "You may move from location pos43 to location pos44 following direction dirdown".

So, pos43's down direction is pos44. So moving from pos43 to pos44 is down. So if the agent is at pos43, they can move down to pos44 (if it's clear). But initially, pos44 has the stone, so it's not clear. So the agent can't move there. Instead, they can push the stone.

Wait, the agent is at pos43, and the stone is at pos44. Then, the agent can push the stone down to pos45 (since pos44's down direction is pos45). To do that, the agent would use pushtonongoal because pos45 is not a goal. The preconditions for pushtonongoal are:

- Agent p is at l_p (pos43)
- Stone s is at l_from (pos44)
- l_to (pos45) is clear
- Direction from l_p to l_from is d (dirdown, since pos43 to pos44 is down)
- Direction from l_from to l_to is d (dirdown, pos44 to pos45 is down)
- l_to is non-goal (pos45 is not a goal)

So, that's possible. So pushing the stone from pos44 to pos45 would move it to pos45, and the agent ends up at pos44.

But our goal is to get the stone to pos42. So maybe this isn't helpful. Alternatively, the agent could push the stone left from pos44 to pos34. For that, the agent needs to be to the right of the stone (pos44's right is pos54, but that's not helpful). Wait, no. To push the stone left, the agent needs to be on the right side of the stone (pos44's right is pos54). Wait, no. Wait, pushing left would mean the stone moves left, so the agent must be on the right side of the stone. For example, to push the stone left from pos44 to pos34, the agent needs to be at pos44's right, which is pos54. But pos54 is clear. But how does the agent get to pos54?

Alternatively, maybe the agent can push the stone up from pos44 to pos43. But that requires the agent to be at pos44's down direction (pos45), pushing up. But pos45 is clear, so the agent could go there. Wait, let's think:

Agent is at pos43. Stone is at pos44. Agent can push the stone down to pos45 (as before). Then, after that, the stone is at pos45. Then, agent is at pos44. From there, agent can move to pos34 (left), pos54 (right), pos43 (up), or pos45 (down). But pos45 now has the stone. So if agent is at pos44, they can move left to pos34 (if clear). pos34 is initially clear. So agent can move from pos44 to pos34, then from pos34 to pos24, etc.

But perhaps another approach: Let's try to get the agent to pos45 to satisfy the first constraint. The constraint says that the agent must be at pos45 in at least one state, and when that happens, there must have been a previous state where stone1 was at pos41 or pos34.

So maybe after moving the stone to pos34, the agent can go to pos45. But how?

Alternatively, the agent can move to pos45 via pushing the stone there. For example, pushing the stone from pos44 to pos45 (as above) would move the agent to pos44. Then, from pos44, the agent can move to pos45 (down), but pos45 now has the stone. So agent can't move there. Wait, after pushing the stone to pos45, the agent is at pos44. Then, the stone is at pos45. So agent can move from pos44 to pos43 (up), then pos43 to pos42 (up), etc.

But this might not help with getting the agent to pos45. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the agent can reach pos45 through another path. Let's see: starting at pos41, the agent can move down to pos42, then down to pos43, then down to pos44 (but pos44 has the stone initially). Wait, no, initially pos44 is occupied by the stone. So agent can't move there. So agent must go around.

Alternative route: pos41 → pos42 (down) → pos43 (down). From pos43, they can move right to pos53 (if clear). Wait, pos53 is clear initially. So agent can move from pos43 to pos53 (dirright). Then from pos53 to pos54 (dirdown). Then pos54 to pos55 (dirdown). Then pos55 to pos45 (dirleft). So agent can reach pos45 this way. But this path would take several moves. Then, once at pos45, that satisfies the constraint of being there, but we need to ensure that in an earlier state, stone1 was at pos41 or pos34. But initially, stone1 is at pos44. So unless we move it to pos34 or pos41 first, this won't be satisfied.

So perhaps we need to move stone1 to pos34 first. Let's try that. To push the stone from pos44 to pos34, the agent needs to be on the right side of the stone (since pushing left). So agent must be at pos44's right (pos54) to push left. But pos54 is initially clear. So how to get there?

Alternatively, the agent can push the stone left from pos44 to pos34 by being at pos44's east (pos54) and pushing west. Wait, no. Let me think again. To push the stone left (west), the agent needs to be to the east (right) of the stone. So, from pos44, the stone is at pos44. To push it left to pos34, the agent must be at pos54 (east of pos44) and move west. But the movement from pos54 to pos44 is direction dirleft. So the agent can be at pos54, and push the stone at pos44 to pos34 with direction dirleft.

But how does the agent get to pos54? Starting from pos41, the agent can move right to pos51, then down to pos52, then down to pos53, then right to pos54. But that's a long path. Let me check the movement connections:

pos41 can move right to pos51 (dirright), then from pos51 down to pos52 (dirdown), then pos52 down to pos53 (dirdown), then pos53 to pos54 (dirdown). Then from pos54, agent can push the stone at pos44 to pos34.

But wait, the stone is at pos44. So the agent is at pos54, which is to the right (east) of pos44. So the direction from pos54 to pos44 is dirleft. So the agent can perform pushtonongoal (since pos34 is not a goal) with l_p = pos54, l_from = pos44, l_to = pos34, direction dirleft. Let's check the preconditions:

- Agent is at pos54: yes.
- Stone is at pos44: yes.
- pos34 is clear: initially yes.
- Can move from pos54 to pos44 via dirleft? Looking at the movement rules: "You may move from location pos44 to location pos54 following direction dirright", but the reverse (pos54 to pos44) would be dirleft. Let me check: "You may move from location pos54 to location pos44 following direction dirleft". Yes. So yes, the agent can move from pos54 to pos44 via dirleft. So the direction is dirleft. Then, the stone moves from pos44 to pos34 via dirleft. So the action would be:

pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos54 pos44 pos34 dirleft

After this action, the agent would be at pos44, and the stone at pos34. Now, the agent is at pos44, and the stone is at pos34. Then, this satisfies the constraint that when the agent is at pos45 (later), there was a previous state where the stone was at pos34.

Now, the agent is at pos44. To get to pos45, they can move down (dirdown) from pos44 to pos45 (if clear). But after pushing the stone to pos34, the stone is at pos34, so pos45 is clear. Wait, no: after pushing the stone to pos34, the stone is at pos34. pos45 was clear initially, and after this push, the agent is at pos44. So pos45 is still clear. So the agent can move from pos44 to pos45 via dirdown. Then, the agent is at pos45, which satisfies the first constraint. Also, the previous state had stone1 at pos34, which meets the condition.

So far, that's part of the plan.

But we also need to have the stone at pos22 at some point. So after moving the stone to pos34, how to get it to pos22.

From pos34, the agent can push it left to pos24, then to pos14, etc., but that's moving left. Alternatively, maybe push it up to pos33. Let's see. The agent is at pos44 after pushing the stone to pos34. Then, the agent can move to pos34 (dirleft), pushing the stone further.

Wait, after the first push to pos34, the agent is at pos44. Then, the agent can move left to pos34 (if clear). pos34 was clear before the stone was moved there. Now, pos34 has the stone, so it's not clear. So the agent can't move there. So the agent needs to move elsewhere.

Alternatively, the agent is at pos44, and can move up to pos43. From pos43, maybe move left to pos33, then pos32, etc., but I'm not sure. Let's think.

Alternatively, after pushing the stone to pos34, the agent is at pos44. They can move up to pos43, then left to pos33, then left to pos23, etc., to get into position to push the stone from pos34 towards pos22.

But this might take a lot of steps. Let's outline the steps so far:

1. Move agent from pos41 to pos51 (dirright)
2. Move agent from pos51 to pos52 (dirdown)
3. Move agent from pos52 to pos53 (dirdown)
4. Move agent from pos53 to pos54 (dirdown)
5. Push stone1 from pos44 to pos34 with agent at pos54, using pushtonongoal.
6. Move agent from pos44 (after push) to pos45 (dirdown) → satisfies constraint of being at pos45, with previous state having stone1 at pos34.

Now, the stone is at pos34. Next, we need to get it to pos22. How?

From pos34, possible pushes:

- Left to pos24 (agent must be at pos34's right, pos44, and push left). But agent is at pos45 now. So they need to move back. Let's see:

Agent is at pos45. They can move up to pos44, then left to pos34 (but pos34 has the stone, so can't move there). So agent needs to go around.

Alternatively, agent can move from pos45 to pos35 (dirleft), then pos35 to pos34 (dirup), but pos34 has the stone. So can't move there. Hmm.

Alternatively, agent can move from pos45 to pos44 (dirup). pos44 is clear now (stone was pushed to pos34). So agent can move from pos45 to pos44. Then, from pos44, can move left to pos34 (but pos34 has the stone; can't move there). So agent needs to go another way.

Perhaps agent can move from pos44 to pos43 (dirup). Then from pos43 to pos42 (dirup), etc., to get into position to push the stone from pos34 to pos24.

Wait, stone is at pos34. To push it left to pos24, agent needs to be at pos34's right (pos44) and push left. So agent at pos44, direction dirleft. So agent needs to reach pos44 again. From pos45, agent can move up to pos44. Then, perform pushtonongoal (since pos24 is not a goal) to push the stone from pos34 to pos24.

So steps:

7. Move agent from pos45 to pos44 (dirup)
8. Push stone1 from pos34 to pos24 with agent at pos44, direction dirleft. So action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos34 pos24 dirleft

Now, stone is at pos24. Then, agent is at pos34. Now, to push the stone to pos23 (up?), then pos22. Wait, pos24's left is pos14, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, push up from pos24 to pos23. To push up, agent needs to be south of the stone (pos24's down direction is pos34). So agent at pos34 can push the stone up to pos23. Let's check:

Agent is at pos34 after pushing to pos24. So after step 8, agent is at pos34. To push the stone from pos24 to pos23 (up), agent needs to be at pos24's down (pos34) and push up. The direction from agent's location (pos34) to stone's location (pos24) is dirup? Wait, pos34 to pos24 is dirup? Wait, pos34 is in row3, column4. pos24 is row2, column4. So moving up from pos34 would be to pos24. So direction dirup.

So the agent is at pos34, stone is at pos24. Agent can push the stone up to pos23 (since pos24's up direction is pos23? Let me check movement rules for pos24:

"You may move from location pos24 to location pos14 following direction dirleft", "You may move from location pos24 to location pos34 following direction dirright", "You may move from location pos24 to location pos23 following direction dirup", "You may move from location pos24 to location pos25 following direction dirdown".

So yes, from pos24, up is pos23. So pushing the stone from pos24 to pos23 would be direction dirup. So the agent is at pos34 (south of pos24), direction from agent's pos34 to pos24 is dirup. So the action would be pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos24 pos23 dirup.

Preconditions:

- Agent at pos34 (yes, after step 8)
- Stone at pos24 (yes)
- pos23 is clear (initially yes)
- Can move from pos34 to pos24 via dirup (yes)
- Can move from pos24 to pos23 via dirup (yes)
- pos23 is non-goal (yes)

So action 9: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos24 pos23 dirup

Now, stone is at pos23, agent at pos24.

Next, push the stone to pos22. To do that, agent needs to be at pos23's south (pos33) and push up. Or wait, to push the stone left to pos22, the agent needs to be at pos23's east (pos24) and push left. Let's see:

pos23 is connected to pos13 (left), pos33 (right), pos22 (up), pos24 (down). Wait, the directions are:

From pos23: "You may move from location pos23 to location pos13 following direction dirleft", "You may move from location pos23 to location pos33 following direction dirright", "You may move from location pos23 to location pos22 following direction dirup", "You may move from location pos23 to location pos24 following direction dirdown".

So to push the stone from pos23 to pos22 (up), the agent needs to be south of pos23 (pos24) and push up. So agent at pos24, direction dirup. So action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos23 pos22 dirup.

Check preconditions:

- Agent at pos24 (yes)
- Stone at pos23 (yes)
- pos22 is clear (initially yes)
- Can move from pos24 to pos23 via dirup (yes, per movement rules)
- Can move from pos23 to pos22 via dirup (yes)
- pos22 is non-goal (yes)

So action 10: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos23 pos22 dirup

Now, stone is at pos22, satisfying the third constraint. Agent is now at pos23.

Next, we need to get the stone to pos42. From pos22, the path could be pos22 → pos32 → pos42. So agent needs to push the stone right to pos32, then right to pos42.

First, push from pos22 to pos32. To do that, agent must be at pos22's west (pos12) and push east, or at pos22's east (pos32) and push west? Wait, no. To push the stone right (east) to pos32, the agent must be to the west of the stone (pos22's west is pos12). So agent at pos12 can push east. But agent is currently at pos23. So need to move the agent to pos22's west.

Alternatively, the agent can be south of the stone and push north. Wait, pushing directions are based on the agent's position relative to the stone. Let me think again.

To push the stone east (right) to pos32, the agent must be west of the stone (pos22's west is pos12). So agent at pos12, pushing east. But agent is currently at pos23. How to get to pos12?

That's a long path. Alternatively, maybe push the stone south from pos22 to pos23, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, push the stone east to pos32. Let's find a way.

Agent is at pos23. To get to pos22's west (pos12), the agent would need to move through pos23 → pos13 (left), then pos13 → pos12 (up), etc. That seems time-consuming. Alternatively, maybe the agent can move to pos22's east (pos32) and push west. Wait, but pos32 is east of pos22. So to push the stone east to pos32, the agent would need to be west of the stone. But if the agent is east of the stone (pos32), they can't push east. They can only push in the direction they are facing.

Alternatively, perhaps the agent can push the stone north from pos22 to pos12, but that's not helpful. This seems tricky.

Wait, after pushing the stone to pos22, agent is at pos23. Let's see:

Agent at pos23. The stone is at pos22. To push it east to pos32, the agent needs to be at pos22's west (pos12), which is far away. Alternatively, the agent can move around to the east side of the stone.

Let's think: agent at pos23. They can move down to pos24, then right to pos34, etc. But this might not help.

Alternatively, agent can move from pos23 to pos33 (right), then down to pos43, etc., to get to the east side of pos22.

Wait, pos23 → pos33 (right), then pos33 → pos34 (down), pos34 → pos44 (right), pos44 → pos54 (right), pos54 → pos55 (down), etc. Not helpful.

Alternatively, agent could move from pos23 to pos22 (up) — but pos22 has the stone. So they can't. So agent needs to find another path.

Alternatively, agent moves from pos23 to pos13 (left), then pos13 to pos12 (up), then pos12 to pos22 (right). Then agent is at pos22, but the stone is also at pos22. So that's not possible. So this approach won't work.

Hmm. Maybe there's a different way to push the stone from pos22 to pos32. Let's think again.

The stone is at pos22. To push it right (east) to pos32, the agent needs to be to the west of the stone (pos12), and push east. But getting the agent there is time-consuming. Alternatively, the agent could push the stone down to pos23 (from pos24), but that's not helpful.

Alternatively, maybe the agent can push the stone up to pos12, but pos12 is not helpful. This is getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps after getting the stone to pos22, we can then push it back towards pos42 via another route. For example, push it down to pos23, then right to pos33, then up to pos32, then right to pos42. But that might require more steps.

Alternatively, maybe after the stone is at pos22, the agent can push it down to pos23 (from pos24), then from pos23 to pos24 (down), but that's not helpful.

This part is tricky. Let's take a step back. We need to get the stone from pos22 to pos42. The shortest path seems to be pos22 → pos32 → pos42. So the agent needs to push the stone east twice.

But to do that, the agent must be west of the stone each time. So first, push from pos22 to pos32 (agent west at pos12), then push from pos32 to pos42 (agent west at pos22). But getting the agent to pos12 is a long way.

Alternatively, after the stone is at pos22, the agent could move all the way around to the west side. Let's try to plan that path.

Agent is at pos23. Path to pos12:

pos23 → pos13 (dirleft), pos13 → pos12 (dirup), then pos12 → pos22 (dirright) — but the stone is at pos22, so agent can't move there. So agent can only reach pos12, then push the stone east from there.

So steps after stone at pos22:

11. Move agent from pos23 to pos13 (dirleft)
12. Move agent from pos13 to pos12 (dirup)
13. Push stone1 from pos22 to pos32 (pushtonongoal, since pos32 is not a goal)
Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos12 pos22 pos32 dirright

Check preconditions:

- Agent at pos12: yes
- Stone at pos22: yes
- pos32 is clear: initially yes
- Can move from pos12 to pos22 via dirright? Let's check movement rules for pos12: "You may move from location pos12 to location pos22 following direction dirright". Yes. So direction is dirright.
- From pos22 to pos32 via dirright: yes, per movement rules.
- pos32 is non-goal: yes.

So this action is valid. After this, the stone is at pos32, agent at pos22.

Then, next push from pos32 to pos42. Agent needs to be west of pos32 (pos22) and push east.

Agent is already at pos22. So:

14. Push stone1 from pos32 to pos42 (pushtogoal, since pos42 is a goal)
Action: pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos32 pos42 dirright

Check preconditions:

- Agent at pos22: yes
- Stone at pos32: yes
- pos42 is clear: initially yes, but after previous steps, need to check. After step 13, pos32 has the stone, pos42 is clear. So yes.
- Can move from pos22 to pos32 via dirright: yes.
- Can move from pos32 to pos42 via dirright: yes.
- pos42 is a goal location: yes.

So this action is valid. After this, stone1 is at pos42 (goal), agent is at pos32.

Now, the main goal is achieved. Now, check all constraints:

1. Agent must be at pos45: yes, step 6.
   - Previous state had stone1 at pos34: yes (step 5).
2. Stone1 must be at pos22: yes, step 10.
3. pos15 must not be clear at some point. We haven't addressed this yet. Oh no! We need to make sure that in some state, pos15 is not clear. How to achieve this?

Looking back, our current plan doesn't involve pos15. So we need to include an action that causes pos15 to be occupied. Since the only objects are the agent and the stone, pos15 can be occupied by either. The stone is currently at pos42 (goal), so unless we move it again, which would be counterproductive, we need to have the agent visit pos15, or move the stone there temporarily.

But moving the stone to pos15 would require pushing it away from the goal, which would make the plan longer. Alternatively, the agent can move to pos15, making pos15 not clear. But how?

The agent needs to reach pos15. Let's see the path from pos32 (current agent position after step 14) to pos15.

pos32 → pos22 (dirleft), then pos22 → pos12 (dirup), then pos12 → pos13 (dirdown), pos13 → pos14 (dirdown), pos14 → pos15 (dirdown). But this would take several steps. Then, agent at pos15 would make pos15 not clear. But this adds steps, which may not be optimal. But since the problem requires an optimal plan, we need to find the shortest way.

Alternatively, maybe during the earlier steps, we can have the agent or stone visit pos15. For example, after step 5 (stone at pos34), maybe push it to pos24, then pos25, then pos15? But that's a long way.

Alternatively, when the stone was at pos24 (step 8), push it down to pos25, then left to pos15. But that requires several steps.

This is a problem. We need to ensure that pos15 is not clear at least once. Let's think: perhaps during the agent's movement to pos45, they can pass through pos15, but that's unlikely. The initial movement to pos45 was via pos44 → pos45 (step 6). But that path doesn't go near pos15.

Alternatively, after step 14 (stone at pos42), the agent is at pos32. The agent can then move to pos22, pos12, pos13, pos14, pos15. Each move takes steps. Let's see:

From pos32:

- pos32 → pos22 (dirleft)
- pos22 → pos12 (dirleft)
- pos12 → pos13 (dirdown)
- pos13 → pos14 (dirdown)
- pos14 → pos15 (dirdown)

So 5 moves. Then, agent at pos15 makes pos15 not clear. But this adds 5 steps to the plan, making it longer. But the problem requires an optimal plan. However, maybe there's a smarter way.

Wait, maybe during the initial steps, when the agent is moving from pos54 to pos44 (step 5), there's a way to have the agent pass through pos15. But that's not possible due to the grid layout.

Alternatively, when the stone is at pos24 (step 8), perhaps push it down to pos25, then left to pos15. Let's explore:

After step 8, stone is at pos24. Agent is at pos34. So steps after step 8 could be:

9. Push stone1 from pos24 to pos25 (dirdown)
   - Agent is at pos24 (after pushing?), wait, no. To push from pos24 to pos25 (dirdown), the agent must be at pos24's up (pos14) and push down. Or wait, no. To push the stone down, the agent must be north of the stone. For example, if the stone is at pos24, to push it down to pos25, the agent must be at pos24's north (pos14) and push down. But agent is currently at pos34.

So agent needs to get to pos14. That's a long way. Alternatively, maybe not feasible.

Alternatively, after step 8, agent is at pos34. They can move to pos24 (dirup), but pos24 has the stone. So can't. So agent needs to find another path.

This is getting too complicated. Perhaps the optimal plan requires the agent to visit pos15 after achieving the main goal. But that would add steps. However, since the problem requires the constraints to be met, we have to include it.

So after step 14, stone is at pos42 (goal). Agent is at pos32. Then:

15. Move agent from pos32 to pos22 (dirleft)
16. Move from pos22 to pos12 (dirleft)
17. Move from pos12 to pos13 (dirdown)
18. Move from pos13 to pos14 (dirdown)
19. Move from pos14 to pos15 (dirdown)

Now, agent is at pos15, making pos15 not clear. This satisfies constraint 3. Then, the agent can move back to pos14, etc., but that's not necessary for the plan. However, this adds 5 steps, making the plan longer. Is there a shorter way?

Wait, during earlier steps, could we have the agent visit pos15? For example, after step 6 (agent at pos45), maybe the agent can move to pos35 (dirleft), then pos34 (dirup), but that's not helpful. Alternatively, from pos45, agent can move to pos55 (dirright), then pos54 (dirup), but that's not helping.

Alternatively, after step 6 (agent at pos45), the agent could move to pos55 (dirright), then pos54 (dirup), pos44 (dirup), pos43 (dirup), pos42 (dirup), pos32 (dirleft), etc. But this also doesn't help.

Hmm. It seems that the only way to satisfy the pos15 constraint is to have the agent visit it after the main goal is achieved, adding steps. But the problem requires an optimal plan. Maybe there's a way to combine this with other steps.

Wait, perhaps when the stone is at pos22 (step 10), the agent is at pos23. The agent could move to pos24 (dirdown), then pos25 (dirdown), then pos15 (dirleft). But pos25 is row2, column5. pos15 is row1, column5. So from pos25, can the agent move up to pos15? Let's check the movement rules for pos25:

"You may move from location pos25 to location pos15 following direction dirleft", "You may move from location pos25 to location pos35 following direction dirright", "You may move from location pos25 to location pos24 following direction dirup".

Wait, to get from pos25 to pos15, the direction is dirleft. But pos25's left would be pos24? No, pos25 is row2, column5. dirleft would be column4, row2: pos24. So to get to pos15 from pos25, perhaps via pos24 → pos14 → pos15. But that's another route.

Alternatively, after step 10 (stone at pos22, agent at pos23), the agent could go to pos24, then pos25, then pos15 via some path. Let's see:

After step 10:

Agent is at pos23. To reach pos15:

pos23 → pos24 (dirdown)
pos24 → pos25 (dirdown)
pos25 → pos24 (dirup) — no. Or pos25 → pos15 (dirleft). Wait, movement from pos25 to pos15: "You may move from location pos25 to location pos15 following direction dirleft". Yes. So agent can move from pos25 to pos15 via dirleft.

So steps:

11. Move agent from pos23 to pos24 (dirdown)
12. Move agent from pos24 to pos25 (dirdown)
13. Move agent from pos25 to pos15 (dirleft)

Now, agent is at pos15, making it not clear. This satisfies constraint 3. Then, the agent can proceed to push the stone to pos32 and pos42 as before. But this would require adjusting the earlier steps. Let's rework the plan.

So revised steps after step 10 (stone at pos22, agent at pos23):

11. Move agent pos23 → pos24 (dirdown)
12. Move agent pos24 → pos25 (dirdown)
13. Move agent pos25 → pos15 (dirleft) → pos15 is not clear now.
14. Move agent pos15 → pos25 (dirright)
15. Move agent pos25 → pos24 (dirup)
16. Move agent pos24 → pos23 (dirup)
17. Push stone1 from pos22 to pos32 (as before)
...

But this adds more steps. However, this way, we satisfy the pos15 constraint earlier.

But then we need to get back to pushing the stone, which may take more steps. This complicates the plan. But given that the constraints must be met, it's necessary.

But perhaps there's a smarter way. For example, when the agent is moving from pos54 to pos44 to push the stone to pos34 (step5), could they pass through pos15 earlier? Probably not, given the grid layout.

This is getting quite involved. Let's try to compile the steps considering all constraints.

Final Plan Steps:

1. Move player1 from pos41 to pos42 (dirdown)
   - Pre: pos42 is clear. Yes.
2. Move player1 from pos42 to pos43 (dirdown)
3. Move player1 from pos43 to pos44 (dirdown) → But pos44 has the stone. Can't move. So this is invalid. Oops, mistake here.

Wait, initial plan earlier had the agent moving to pos54 to push the stone from pos44 to pos34. Let's correct that.

Correct Steps:

1. Move player1 from pos41 to pos51 (dirright)
2. Move player1 from pos51 to pos52 (dirdown)
3. Move player1 from pos52 to pos53 (dirdown)
4. Move player1 from pos53 to pos54 (dirdown)
5. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos54 pos44 pos34 dirleft
   - After this, player1 is at pos44, stone1 at pos34.
6. Move player1 from pos44 to pos45 (dirdown)
   - Now, pos45 is clear. Satisfies constraint 1.
7. Now, need to move the stone from pos34 to pos24, pos23, pos22.
   - Move player1 from pos45 to pos44 (dirup)
8. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos34 pos24 dirleft
   - Player1 now at pos34, stone1 at pos24.
9. Move player1 from pos34 to pos24 (dirup)
10. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos23 pos22 dirup (Wait, stone is at pos24. To push to pos23, agent needs to be south of pos24. So agent at pos34 (south of pos24) can push up.

Wait, step 8: after pushing stone1 to pos24, agent is at pos34. Then, to push it to pos23:

11. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos24 pos23 dirup
    - Now, stone at pos23, agent at pos24.
12. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos23 pos22 dirup
    - Now, stone at pos22, agent at pos23.
13. Now, need to make pos15 not clear.
    - Agent moves from pos23 to pos24 (dirdown)
14. Move player1 pos24 → pos25 (dirdown)
15. Move player1 pos25 → pos15 (dirleft)
    - Now, pos15 is not clear. Satisfies constraint 3.
16. Move player1 pos15 → pos25 (dirright)
17. Move player1 pos25 → pos24 (dirup)
18. Move player1 pos24 → pos23 (dirup)
19. Now, push stone1 from pos22 to pos32:
    - Agent needs to be at pos12 (west of pos22)
    - Steps to get there: pos23 → pos13 (dirleft)
20. Move player1 pos23 → pos13 (dirleft)
21. Move player1 pos13 → pos12 (dirup)
22. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos12 pos22 pos32 dirright
    - Stone at pos32, agent at pos22.
23. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos32 pos42 dirright
    - Stone at pos42 (goal), agent at pos32.

Now, check constraints:

- player1 at pos45: step6.
- stone1 at pos34 before step6: yes (step5).
- stone1 at pos22: step12.
- pos15 not clear: step15.
- player1 at pos43: Need to check. In current steps, player1 hasn't been to pos43. But one of the constraints is that player1 must be at pos43 at least once, and when they are, there must have been a previous state where pos53 or pos55 is not clear.

Oops, missed that constraint. So we need to ensure player1 is at pos43, and when they are, pos53 or pos55 was not clear in a previous state.

In the current steps, player1 hasn't been to pos43. So we need to adjust the plan to include this.

How to achieve that.

To get player1 to pos43, and satisfy the constraint that when they are there, pos53 or pos55 was not clear previously.

pos53 and pos55 are initially clear. So to make them not clear, the agent or stone must be there.

Possibly, during the initial movement to pos54 (step4), the agent could pass through pos53, making pos53 not clear. But pos53 is clear initially. When the agent moves to pos53 (step3), pos53 is not clear while the agent is there. Then, when the agent moves to pos54 (step4), pos53 becomes clear again. So the only time pos53 is not clear is when the agent is there.

So, if during the plan, the agent is at pos43 (step 2), then when they are at pos43, there must have been a previous state where pos53 or pos55 was not clear. When agent is at pos43 (step2), the previous steps were moving to pos53 (step3), which makes pos53 not clear. So step2: agent is at pos43. Step3: agent is at pos53. So when agent is at pos43 (step2), the previous states include step1 and step2. In step3, pos53 is not clear. But step3 comes after step2. So the constraint is that when agent is at pos43 (step2), there must have been an earlier state where pos53 or pos55 was not clear. But at step2, the only previous states are step1 (agent at pos51) and step2 (agent at pos43). So pos53 was clear in those states. So this doesn't satisfy the constraint.

Thus, the agent being at pos43 must be after a state where pos53 or pos55 was not clear.

So, perhaps during step3, agent is at pos53, making pos53 not clear. Then, later, agent moves to pos43. So when agent is at pos43 (step4), there was a previous state (step3) where pos53 was not clear.

But in our initial steps, after step4 (agent at pos54), the agent moves to pos53 in step3. So:

Original steps:

1. Move to pos51
2. Move to pos52
3. Move to pos53
4. Move to pos54
5. Push stone to pos34

So, agent is at pos53 in step3. Then, when agent moves to pos54 (step4), pos53 becomes clear. So if later the agent moves back to pos43, the pos53 would have been clear in between.

But we need to have agent at pos43 after a state where pos53 or pos55 was not clear.

So, perhaps after step3 (agent at pos53), agent moves to pos43 (step4). Then, when agent is at pos43 (step4), there's a previous state (step3) where pos53 was not clear. This would satisfy the constraint.

So revised steps:

1. Move player1 pos41 → pos51 (dirright)
2. Move player1 pos51 → pos52 (dirdown)
3. Move player1 pos52 → pos53 (dirdown) → pos53 not clear
4. Move player1 pos53 → pos43 (dirleft) → agent at pos43 now. Now, when agent is at pos43 (step4), there was a previous state (step3) where pos53 was not clear. This satisfies constraint 6 and 7.

Then continue:

5. Move player1 pos43 → pos44 (dirdown) → can't, stone is at pos44. So instead, from pos43, agent can move to pos54 (dirright) → but that's not connected. Wait, movement from pos43: "You may move from location pos43 to location pos33 following direction dirleft", "You may move from location pos43 to location pos53 following direction dirright", "You may move from location pos43 to location pos42 following direction dirup", "You may move from location pos43 to location pos44 following direction dirdown".

So from pos43 (step4), agent can move to pos53 (dirright) again, but that's backtracking. Alternatively, move to pos44 (dirdown), but pos44 has the stone. So agent needs to push the stone first.

Wait, stone is at pos44 initially. So after step4, agent is at pos43. To push the stone from pos44 to pos34, agent needs to be at pos54 and push left. So after step4, agent is at pos43. They need to get to pos54 to push the stone.

So revised plan:

1. Move player1 pos41 → pos51 (dirright)
2. Move player1 pos51 → pos52 (dirdown)
3. Move player1 pos52 → pos53 (dirdown) → pos53 not clear
4. Move player1 pos53 → pos54 (dirdown) → step4: agent at pos54, pos53 clear again.
5. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos54 pos44 pos34 dirleft → stone at pos34, agent at pos44.
6. Move agent pos44 → pos45 (dirdown) → step6: agent at pos45 (constraint1)
7. Then proceed as before.

But now, when agent is at pos43 (step not yet in plan), we need to include it. Wait, step4 is agent at pos54. So how to get agent to pos43.

Wait, after step5, agent is at pos44. From there, agent can move up to pos43 (dirup). So:

5. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos54 pos44 pos34 dirleft → agent at pos44
6. Move agent pos44 → pos43 (dirup) → step6: agent at pos43. Now, when agent is at pos43 (step6), the previous states include step5 (agent at pos44), step4 (agent at pos54), step3 (agent at pos53). So step3 (agent at pos53) makes pos53 not clear. Thus, satisfies the constraint that when agent is at pos43, there was an earlier state where pos53 was not clear.

So steps adjusted:

1. Move player1 pos41 → pos51
2. Move pos51 → pos52
3. Move pos52 → pos53 → pos53 not clear (satisfies part of constraint6)
4. Move pos53 → pos54
5. Push stone1 from pos44 to pos34 → agent at pos44
6. Move agent pos44 → pos43 → agent at pos43 (satisfies constraint6)
   - Now, when agent is at pos43 (step6), previous state step3 had pos53 not clear.

This works.

Now, continue with the plan:

7. Move agent pos43 → pos44 (dirdown) → but stone is at pos34. So pos44 is clear. Yes.
8. Move agent pos44 → pos45 (dirdown) → satisfies constraint1 (agent at pos45, previous state had stone at pos34)
9. Now, need to push stone from pos34 to pos24:
   - Agent at pos45, move to pos44 (dirup)
10. Move pos45 → pos44 (dirup)
11. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos34 pos24 dirleft → stone at pos24, agent at pos34
12. Now, push stone to pos23:
    - Agent at pos34, push up to pos24 → stone at pos24. Wait, no. Stone is at pos24. To push to pos23, agent must be south of pos24 (pos34), push up.
    - pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos24 pos23 dirup → stone at pos23, agent at pos24.
13. Push stone to pos22:
    - Agent at pos24, push up to pos23 → stone at pos23 → push up to pos22.
    - pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos23 pos22 dirup → stone at pos22, agent at pos23.
14. Now, need to make pos15 not clear. Agent must go to pos15.
    - From pos23, path to pos15:
    pos23 → pos24 (dirdown)
    pos24 → pos25 (dirdown)
    pos25 → pos15 (dirleft)
15. Move agent pos23 → pos24 (dirdown)
16. Move agent pos24 → pos25 (dirdown)
17. Move agent pos25 → pos15 (dirleft) → pos15 not clear (constraint3)
18. Now, need to return to push stone to pos32 and pos42.
    - Move agent pos15 → pos25 (dirright)
19. Move agent pos25 → pos24 (dirup)
20. Move agent pos24 → pos23 (dirup)
21. Now, push stone from pos22 to pos32:
    - Agent needs to be west of pos22 (pos12)
    - Path: pos23 → pos13 (dirleft)
    pos13 → pos12 (dirup)
22. Move agent pos23 → pos13 (dirleft)
23. Move agent pos13 → pos12 (dirup)
24. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos12 pos22 pos32 dirright → stone at pos32, agent at pos22
25. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos32 pos42 dirright → stone at pos42 (goal), agent at pos32.

Now, check all constraints:

1. Agent at pos45: step8.
   - Previous state had stone at pos34: step5.
2. Stone at pos22: step13.
3. pos15 not clear: step17.
4. Agent at pos43: step6.
   - Previous state had pos53 not clear: step3.
5. Agent at pos43 only once in a continuous sequence: step6 is a single occurrence.

All constraints are satisfied. Now, check if this is the optimal plan. Are there unnecessary steps? Let's count the steps:

Actions:

1. move player1 pos41 pos51 dirright
2. move player1 pos51 pos52 dirdown
3. move player1 pos52 pos53 dirdown
4. move player1 pos53 pos54 dirdown
5. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos54 pos44 pos34 dirleft
6. move player1 pos44 pos43 dirup
7. move player1 pos43 pos44 dirdown
8. move player1 pos44 pos45 dirdown
9. move player1 pos45 pos44 dirup
10. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos34 pos24 dirleft
11. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos24 pos23 dirup
12. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos23 pos22 dirup
13. move player1 pos23 pos24 dirdown
14. move player1 pos24 pos25 dirdown
15. move player1 pos25 pos15 dirleft
16. move player1 pos15 pos25 dirright
17. move player1 pos25 pos24 dirup
18. move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup
19. move player1 pos23 pos13 dirleft
20. move player1 pos13 pos12 dirup
21. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos12 pos22 pos32 dirright
22. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos32 pos42 dirright

That's 22 actions. But perhaps there's a shorter way. For example, after step6 (agent at pos43), instead of moving to pos44 and pos45, maybe combine some steps.

Wait, after step5, agent is at pos44. Then step6 is move to pos43. Then step7 move back to pos44. Perhaps these steps can be eliminated if the agent moves directly to pos45 from pos44 after step5.

Wait, step5: agent at pos44. Then, step6: move to pos43. Then step7: move back to pos44. This is redundant. Why not go directly to pos45 from pos44?

Because the constraint requires agent to be at pos43. So step6 is necessary to satisfy the constraint. But after step6, agent is at pos43. Then step7 moves back to pos44 to proceed to pos45.

Alternatively, after step5 (agent at pos44), instead of moving to pos43, can the agent go directly to pos45, but that would miss the pos43 constraint.

So step6 is necessary. Thus, the steps are required.

But this makes the plan longer. Is there a way to combine steps or find a shorter path?

Another approach: After step3 (agent at pos53), instead of moving to pos54, perhaps push the stone from pos44 to pos34 while agent is at pos53.

Wait, agent is at pos53. To push the stone at pos44 to pos34, the agent must be at pos54 (east of pos44) to push left. So agent at pos53 can't do that. Thus, they need to move to pos54 first.

Alternatively, after step3 (agent at pos53), move to pos43 (dirleft), then pos44 (dirdown). But pos44 has the stone. So agent can't move there. So they need to push the stone.

But agent at pos43 can push the stone down to pos45. But that would require:

pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos44 pos45 dirdown

Preconditions:

- Agent at pos43: yes (step4)
- Stone at pos44: yes
- pos45 is clear: yes
- Can move from pos43 to pos44 via dirdown: yes
- Can move from pos44 to pos45 via dirdown: yes
- pos45 is non-goal: yes

So action4: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos44 pos45 dirdown

Then, agent is at pos44, stone at pos45. Then, agent can move to pos45 (dirdown), but pos45 now has the stone. So can't. So this doesn't help.

Alternatively, pushing the stone from pos44 to pos43 (dirup). Agent at pos44's down (pos45) can push up. But agent is at pos43. To push up from pos44 to pos43, agent must be south of pos44 (pos45) and push up. But agent is at pos43, which is north of pos44. So this isn't possible.

Thus, the initial approach seems necessary.

Given all this, the final plan includes the steps outlined, though it's quite long. But the problem requires an optimal plan, which is the shortest possible. However, I might have missed a shorter path. Let's think again.

Alternative approach: Use the pushtogoal action directly after moving the stone to pos32.

Wait, after pushing the stone to pos32, we can push it to pos42 in one step. But that requires the agent to be at pos22, which is possible.

Another idea: After step5 (stone at pos34), instead of moving all the way around, the agent can move from pos44 to pos34 (dirleft), but pos34 has the stone. So can't. So agent needs to go via pos43, pos33, etc., to get to the west side of pos34.

Alternatively, agent at pos44 can move to pos34 (dirleft) if it's clear. But after step5, stone is at pos34, so pos34 is occupied. So agent can't.

Thus, the initial plan seems necessary.

Finally, the plan must be written with all actions in order, ensuring all constraints are met. Given the complexity, I'll proceed to write the final answer with the steps we've outlined, ensuring all constraints are satisfied.
