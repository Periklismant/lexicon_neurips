Let me define the problem:

We have a 2D grid with the following objects:
- A player (player1)
- A stone (stone1)
- Various locations (pos11, pos12, ..., pos55)
- Goal locations (pos54 is a goal location)
- Directions (dirdown, dirleft, dirright, dirup)

Initial state:
- The player is at pos32
- The stone is at pos44
- All other locations are clear

Goal:
- The stone is at a goal location (i.e., pos54)

Constraints:
1. "Location pos33 is not clear" must hold in at most one continuous sequence of states
2. "Location pos34 is not clear" must hold in at most one continuous sequence of states
3. At least one of "Location pos11 is not clear" or "Location pos12 is not clear" must hold in at least one state
4. "Location pos13 is not clear" must hold in at least one state
5. "Location pos41 is not clear" must hold in at least one state

Let's visualize the grid for clarity:

```
(1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (1,4) (1,5)
(2,1) (2,2) (2,3) (2,4) (2,5)
(3,1) (3,2) (3,3) (3,4) (3,5)
(4,1) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) (4,5)
(5,1) (5,2) (5,3) (5,4) (5,5)
```

Player (P) is at pos32 (3,2), and stone (S) is at pos44 (4,4). The goal (G) is at pos54 (5,4).

```
... ... ... ... ...
... ... ... ... ...
... P   ... ... ...
... ... ... S   ...
... ... ... G   ...
```

So, to achieve the goal, we need to push the stone from pos44 to pos54. To do this, the player needs to be at pos34, and push the stone from pos44 to pos54, following the direction dirright.

But first, let's check the constraints:
1. "Location pos33 is not clear" should only be occupied in one continuous sequence. This means the player can only pass through pos33 once (without leaving and coming back).
2. Similarly for pos34.
3. We need to ensure that either pos11 or pos12 (or both) are occupied at some point.
4. pos13 needs to be occupied at some point.
5. pos41 needs to be occupied at some point.

These constraints dictate the path the player must take to reach the stone and push it to the goal.

Let's plan the player's movements, keeping the constraints in mind:

1. Start at pos32
2. Meet constraint 5: Move to pos41 (through other positions)
3. Meet constraint 3: Move to either pos11 or pos12 (or both)
4. Meet constraint 4: Move to pos13
5. Navigate to pos34 (through positions other than pos33 if possible, to avoid violating constraint 1 if we need to pass through pos33 later)
6. Push the stone from pos44 to pos54

Now, let's trace a specific path:

Starting at pos32:
- Move to pos33 (through constraint 1's single continuous sequence)
- Move to pos43
- Move to pos42
- Move to pos41 (meeting constraint 5)
- Move to pos31
- Move to pos21
- Move to pos11 (meeting constraint 3)
- Move to pos12
- Move to pos13 (meeting constraint 4)
- Move to pos23
- Move to pos24
- Move to pos34
- Push the stone from pos44 to pos54 (meeting the goal)

Actually, before deciding on the exact moves, let's be more careful about constraints 1 and 2. These say that locations pos33 and pos34 should be occupied by at most one continuous sequence of states. This means that once the player leaves these locations, they can't return. So, we need to be cautious about the path we choose.

Let's reconsider. To push the stone from pos44 to pos54, the player needs to be at pos34. To get to pos34, the player can move from various directions. But they need to visit pos41, pos11/pos12, and pos13 before pushing the stone.

Let's work out a specific path that satisfies all constraints:

Starting at pos32:
1. Move to pos42 (dirright)
2. Move to pos41 (dirup) (meeting constraint 5)
3. Move to pos31 (dirleft)
4. Move to pos21 (dirleft)
5. Move to pos11 (dirleft) (meeting constraint 3)
6. Move to pos12 (dirdown) (also meeting constraint 3)
7. Move to pos13 (dirdown) (meeting constraint 4)
8. Move to pos23 (dirright)
9. Move to pos33 (dirright) (entering constraint 1's continuous sequence)
10. Move to pos34 (dirdown) (entering constraint 2's continuous sequence)
11. Move to pos44 (dirright) (now the player is in position to push the stone)
12. Push the stone from pos44 to pos54 (dirright) (achieving the goal)

Wait, there's a mistake above. When we "move to pos44 (dirright)", that's not possible because the stone is already at pos44. The player needs to be at pos34 to push the stone from pos44 to pos54.

Let's correct the sequence:

Starting at pos32:
1. Move to pos42 (dirright)
2. Move to pos41 (dirup) (meeting constraint 5)
3. Move to pos31 (dirleft)
4. Move to pos21 (dirleft)
5. Move to pos11 (dirleft) (meeting constraint 3)
6. Move to pos12 (dirdown) (also meeting constraint 3)
7. Move to pos13 (dirdown) (meeting constraint 4)
8. Move to pos23 (dirright)
9. Move to pos33 (dirright) (entering constraint 1's continuous sequence)
10. Move to pos34 (dirdown) (entering constraint 2's continuous sequence)
11. Push the stone from pos44 to pos54 using the "pushtogoal" action (since pos54 is a goal location)

So, the correct move to push the stone is:
11. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos44 pos54 dirright

Let's double check these actions:
1. "move player1 pos32 pos42 dirright": Player moves from pos32 to pos42 following direction dirright.
2. "move player1 pos42 pos41 dirup": Player moves from pos42 to pos41 following direction dirup.
3. "move player1 pos41 pos31 dirleft": Player moves from pos41 to pos31 following direction dirleft.
4. "move player1 pos31 pos21 dirleft": Player moves from pos31 to pos21 following direction dirleft.
5. "move player1 pos21 pos11 dirleft": Player moves from pos21 to pos11 following direction dirleft.
6. "move player1 pos11 pos12 dirdown": Player moves from pos11 to pos12 following direction dirdown.
7. "move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown": Player moves from pos12 to pos13 following direction dirdown.
8. "move player1 pos13 pos23 dirright": Player moves from pos13 to pos23 following direction dirright.
9. "move player1 pos23 pos33 dirright": Player moves from pos23 to pos33 following direction dirright.
10. "move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown": Player moves from pos33 to pos34 following direction dirdown.
11. "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos44 pos54 dirright": Player pushes stone1 from pos44 to pos54 following direction dirright.

Wait, I made a mistake on my directions. Direction "dirdown" actually means moving "down" on the grid, which would mean increasing the first coordinate, not the second. The second directional parameter should be "dirright" for right, "dirleft" for left, "dirdown" for down, and "dirup" for up.

Let me re-clarify directions and the grid for myself. Let's refer to the grid as (row, column):
- dirdown: (row+1, column)
- dirup: (row-1, column)
- dirright: (row, column+1)
- dirleft: (row, column-1)

Now, for the actions, assuming I've understood the directions correctly:
1. "move player1 pos32 pos42 dirdown"
2. "move player1 pos42 pos41 dirleft"
3. "move player1 pos41 pos31 dirup"
4. "move player1 pos31 pos21 dirup"
5. "move player1 pos21 pos11 dirup"
6. "move player1 pos11 pos12 dirright"
7. "move player1 pos12 pos13 dirright"
8. "move player1 pos13 pos23 dirdown"
9. "move player1 pos23 pos33 dirdown"
10. "move player1 pos33 pos34 dirright"
11. "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos44 pos54 dirright"

Actually, I realize I was mistaken in my grid representation. Given the way the positions are named as posXY, where X seems to be the row and Y the column, let me remap the grid:

```
(1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (1,4) (1,5)
(2,1) (2,2) (2,3) (2,4) (2,5)
(3,1) (3,2) (3,3) (3,4) (3,5)
(4,1) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) (4,5)
(5,1) (5,2) (5,3) (5,4) (5,5)
```

Now, let's clarify the directions:
- dirdown: Move to the next row (e.g., from pos11 to pos21)
- dirup: Move to the previous row (e.g., from pos21 to pos11)
- dirright: Move to the next column (e.g., from pos11 to pos12)
- dirleft: Move to the previous column (e.g., from pos12 to pos11)

With this understanding, I'll restate our plan:

Starting at pos32 (3rd row, 2nd column):
1. "move player1 pos32 pos31 dirleft": Player moves left.
2. "move player1 pos31 pos41 dirdown": Player moves down.
3. "move player1 pos41 pos31 dirup": Player moves up.
4. "move player1 pos31 pos21 dirup": Player moves up.
5. "move player1 pos21 pos11 dirup": Player moves up.
6. "move player1 pos11 pos12 dirright": Player moves right.
7. "move player1 pos12 pos13 dirright": Player moves right.
8. "move player1 pos13 pos23 dirdown": Player moves down.
9. "move player1 pos23 pos33 dirdown": Player moves down.
10. "move player1 pos33 pos34 dirright": Player moves right.
11. "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos44 pos54 dirright": Player pushes stone1 from pos44 to pos54.

Wait, I notice something's wrong with our step 3. We're moving player1 from pos41 to pos31, which is the same as step 2 but in reverse. Let me redo the plan more carefully.

Starting at pos32 (3rd row, 2nd column):
1. "move player1 pos32 pos31 dirleft": Player moves left to pos31 (3rd row, 1st column).
2. "move player1 pos31 pos41 dirdown": Player moves down to pos41 (4th row, 1st column) (meeting constraint 5).
3. "move player1 pos41 pos51 dirdown": Player moves down to pos51 (5th row, 1st column).
4. "move player1 pos51 pos52 dirright": Player moves right to pos52 (5th row, 2nd column).
5. "move player1 pos52 pos42 dirup": Player moves up to pos42 (4th row, 2nd column).
6. "move player1 pos42 pos32 dirup": Player moves up to pos32 (3rd row, 2nd column). (Back where we started, but we've met constraint 5 by visiting pos41).
7. "move player1 pos32 pos22 dirup": Player moves up to pos22 (2nd row, 2nd column).
8. "move player1 pos22 pos12 dirup": Player moves up to pos12 (1st row, 2nd column) (meeting constraint 3).
9. "move player1 pos12 pos13 dirright": Player moves right to pos13 (1st row, 3rd column) (meeting constraint 4).
10. "move player1 pos13 pos23 dirdown": Player moves down to pos23 (2nd row, 3rd column).
11. "move player1 pos23 pos33 dirdown": Player moves down to pos33 (3rd row, 3rd column) (entering constraint 1's continuous sequence).
12. "move player1 pos33 pos34 dirright": Player moves right to pos34 (3rd row, 4th column) (entering constraint 2's continuous sequence).
13. "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos44 pos54 dirright": Player pushes stone1 from pos44 to pos54 (5th row, 4th column, which is a goal location).

Now I'm confused about the naming convention and which position is in which row and column.

Let's check based on the provided "You may move from location posXY to location posAB" statements:

From the fact that "You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright", it seems like the first digit represents the column, and the second digit represents the row. This makes sense if the positions are named as pos(column)(row).

Using this interpretation, I've been wrong in my grid visualization. Let me correct it:

```
(1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (4,1) (5,1)
(1,2) (2,2) (3,2) (4,2) (5,2)
(1,3) (2,3) (3,3) (4,3) (5,3)
(1,4) (2,4) (3,4) (4,4) (5,4)
(1,5) (2,5) (3,5) (4,5) (5,5)
```

But wait, this doesn't seem right either. Let me double check the "You may move" statements and determine the direction conventions:

- "You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright"
  - Moving from pos11 to pos21 should be moving to the right (increasing the first coordinate).
- "You may move from location pos11 to location pos12 following direction dirdown"
  - Moving from pos11 to pos12 should be moving down (increasing the second coordinate).

Using these, it seems like the positions are named as pos(row)(column).

So the correct grid is:

```
(1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (1,4) (1,5)
(2,1) (2,2) (2,3) (2,4) (2,5)
(3,1) (3,2) (3,3) (3,4) (3,5)
(4,1) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) (4,5)
(5,1) (5,2) (5,3) (5,4) (5,5)
```

And the direction conventions are:
- dirright: Increase the row (e.g., from pos11 to pos21)
- dirleft: Decrease the row (e.g., from pos21 to pos11)
- dirdown: Increase the column (e.g., from pos11 to pos12)
- dirup: Decrease the column (e.g., from pos12 to pos11)

But this doesn't match the statement "You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright". Let's double check all the "You may move" statements to be sure:

- "You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright"
  - This suggests dirright increases the row.
- "You may move from location pos11 to location pos12 following direction dirdown"
  - This suggests dirdown increases the column.

Based on these, it seems like the positions are named as pos(row)(column), and the directions work as follows:
- dirright: Increase the row
- dirleft: Decrease the row
- dirdown: Increase the column
- dirup: Decrease the column

But this seems counterintuitive given the usual convention in grids. Let me double check another statement:

- "You may move from location pos21 to location pos11 following direction dirleft"
  - This suggests dirleft decreases the row.

- "You may move from location pos12 to location pos11 following direction dirup"
  - This suggests dirup decreases the column.

OK this convention makes sense actually, so I'm convinced that positions are named as pos(row)(column), and the directions are defined as:
- dirright: Increase the row
- dirleft: Decrease the row
- dirdown: Increase the column
- dirup: Decrease the column

That means we're working with a grid like this:

```
(1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (1,4) (1,5)
(2,1) (2,2) (2,3) (2,4) (2,5)
(3,1) (3,2) (3,3) (3,4) (3,5)
(4,1) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) (4,5)
(5,1) (5,2) (5,3) (5,4) (5,5)
```

Now, going back to the initial state:
- Player starts at pos32 (3rd row, 2nd column)
- Stone is at pos44 (4th row, 4th column)
- The goal is at pos54 (5th row, 4th column)

With this clarified, let me replan the sequence of actions to push the stone to the goal while meeting all constraints.

Actually, let's reconfirm the position coordinates by looking at the movement statements provided:

- "You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright"
  - Moving from (1,1) to (2,1) by increasing the first coordinate (moving right).
- "You may move from location pos11 to location pos12 following direction dirdown"
  - Moving from (1,1) to (1,2) by increasing the second coordinate (moving down).

These are consistent with the interpretation where positions are named as pos(row)(column), and the grid is:

```
(1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (1,4) (1,5)
(2,1) (2,2) (2,3) (2,4) (2,5)
(3,1) (3,2) (3,3) (3,4) (3,5)
(4,1) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) (4,5)
(5,1) (5,2) (5,3) (5,4) (5,5)
```

But the directions are a bit off from what I wrote previously because I was wrong. Given the statements:

- "You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright"
  - This suggests dirright increases the row, which means moving towards the right of the grid.
- "You may move from location pos11 to location pos12 following direction dirdown"
  - This suggests dirdown increases the column, which means moving towards the bottom of the grid.

so the correct direction conventions are:
- dirright: Increase the row (move right)
- dirleft: Decrease the row (move left)
- dirdown: Increase the column (move down)
- dirup: Decrease the column (move up)

With this understanding, I'll replan the sequence of actions to push the stone to the goal while meeting all constraints.

Starting at pos32 (3rd row, 2nd column):
1. "move player1 pos32 pos22 dirleft": Player moves left to pos22 (2nd row, 2nd column).
2. "move player1 pos22 pos21 dirup": Player moves up to pos21 (2nd row, 1st column).
3. "move player1 pos21 pos11 dirleft": Player moves left to pos11 (1st row, 1st column) (meeting constraint 3).
4. "move player1 pos11 pos12 dirdown": Player moves down to pos12 (1st row, 2nd column) (also meeting constraint 3).
5. "move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown": Player moves down to pos13 (1st row, 3rd column) (meeting constraint 4).
6. "move player1 pos13 pos23 dirright": Player moves right to pos23 (2nd row, 3rd column).
7. "move player1 pos23 pos33 dirright": Player moves right to pos33 (3rd row, 3rd column) (entering constraint 1's continuous sequence).
8. "move player1 pos33 pos43 dirright": Player moves right to pos43 (4th row, 3rd column).
9. "move player1 pos43 pos53 dirright": Player moves right to pos53 (5th row, 3rd column).
10. "move player1 pos53 pos52 dirup": Player moves up to pos52 (5th row, 2nd column).
11. "move player1 pos52 pos51 dirup": Player moves up to pos51 (5th row, 1st column).
12. "move player1 pos51 pos41 dirleft": Player moves left to pos41 (4th row, 1st column) (meeting constraint 5).
13. "move player1 pos41 pos42 dirdown": Player moves down to pos42 (4th row, 2nd column).
14. "move player1 pos42 pos43 dirdown": Player moves down to pos43 (4th row, 3rd column).
15. "move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft": Player moves left to pos33 (3rd row, 3rd column) (entering constraint 1's continuous sequence again, which violates the constraint).

It seems I'm running into an issue with constraint 1. Let me rethink...

I think I've still been mixed up on my directions. Let me definitely try one more time.

Looking at the "You may move" statements:

- "You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright"
  - This means going from (1,1) to (2,1) is moving right.
- "You may move from location pos11 to location pos12 following direction dirdown"
  - This means going from (1,1) to (1,2) is moving down.

This gives us:
- (1,1) is top-left
- Increasing the first coordinate means moving right.
- Increasing the second coordinate means moving down.

So, the grid looks like:

```
(1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (4,1) (5,1)
(1,2) (2,2) (3,2) (4,2) (5,2)
(1,3) (2,3) (3,3) (4,3) (5,3)
(1,4) (2,4) (3,4) (4,4) (5,4)
(1,5) (2,5) (3,5) (4,5) (5,5)
```

And the direction conventions are:
- dirright: Increase the first coordinate (move right)
- dirleft: Decrease the first coordinate (move left)
- dirdown: Increase the second coordinate (move down)
- dirup: Decrease the second coordinate (move up)

With this understanding, let's clarify the initial state:
- Player starts at pos32 (3,2)
- Stone is at pos44 (4,4)
- The goal is at pos54 (5,4)

Now, let's plan a sequence of actions to push the stone to the goal while meeting all constraints.

Starting at pos32 (3,2):
1. Move to pos22 (dirleft)
2. Move to pos12 (dirleft) (meeting constraint 3)
3. Move to pos11 (dirup) (meeting constraint 3 again)
4. Move to pos21 (dirright)
5. Move to pos31 (dirright)
6. Move to pos41 (dirright) (meeting constraint 5)
7. Move to pos42 (dirdown)
8. Move to pos43 (dirdown)
9. Move to pos33 (dirleft) (entering constraint 1's continuous sequence)
10. Move to pos23 (dirleft)
11. Move to pos13 (dirleft) (meeting constraint 4)
12. Move to pos14 (dirdown)
13. Move to pos24 (dirright)
14. Move to pos34 (dirright) (entering constraint 2's continuous sequence)
15. Pushtogoal stone1 from pos44 to pos54 (dirright)

But let's double-check the constraints again:
1. "Location pos33 is not clear" should hold in at most one continuous sequence of states.
2. "Location pos34 is not clear" should hold in at most one continuous sequence of states.
3. "Location pos11 is not clear" or "Location pos12 is not clear" must hold in at least one state.
4. "Location pos13 is not clear" must hold in at least one state.
5. "Location pos41 is not clear" must hold in at least one state.

I think I've satisfied all the constraints with the sequence I've planned. Let me elaborate on the actions more formally:

1. "move player1 pos32 pos22 dirleft": Player moves from pos32 to pos22 following direction dirleft.
2. "move player1 pos22 pos12 dirleft": Player moves from pos22 to pos12 following direction dirleft. (meeting constraint 3)
3. "move player1 pos12 pos11 dirup": Player moves from pos12 to pos11 following direction dirup. (meeting constraint 3 again)
4. "move player1 pos11 pos21 dirright": Player moves from pos11 to pos21 following direction dirright.
5. "move player1 pos21 pos31 dirright": Player moves from pos21 to pos31 following direction dirright.
6. "move player1 pos31 pos41 dirright": Player moves from pos31 to pos41 following direction dirright. (meeting constraint 5)
7. "move player1 pos41 pos42 dirdown": Player moves from pos41 to pos42 following direction dirdown.
8. "move player1 pos42 pos43 dirdown": Player moves from pos42 to pos43 following direction dirdown.
9. "move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft": Player moves from pos43 to pos33 following direction dirleft. (entering constraint 1's continuous sequence)
10. "move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft": Player moves from pos33 to pos23 following direction dirleft.
11. "move player1 pos23 pos13 dirleft": Player moves from pos23 to pos13 following direction dirleft. (meeting constraint 4)
12. "move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown": Player moves from pos13 to pos14 following direction dirdown.
13. "move player1 pos14 pos24 dirright": Player moves from pos14 to pos24 following direction dirright.
14. "move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright": Player moves from pos24 to pos34 following direction dirright. (entering constraint 2's continuous sequence)
15. "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos44 pos54 dirright": Player pushes stone1 from pos44 to pos54 following direction dirright.

But wait, for the "pushtogoal" action, I need to specify the location of the player before pushing. Let me correct the last action:

15. "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos44 pos54 dirright": Player (at pos34) pushes stone1 from pos44 to pos54 following direction dirright.

Let's again verify the constraints with the plan:
1. "Location pos33 is not clear" holds only when the player is at pos33 (step 9), so it holds in exactly one continuous sequence.
2. "Location pos34 is not clear" holds only when the player is at pos34 (step 14 and partly 15), so it also holds in exactly one continuous sequence.
3. "Location pos11 is not clear" holds when the player is at pos11 (step 3) and "Location pos12 is not clear" holds when the player is at pos12 (step 2), meeting constraint 3.
4. "Location pos13 is not clear" holds when the player is at pos13 (step 11), meeting constraint 4.
5. "Location pos41 is not clear" holds when the player is at pos41 (step 6), meeting constraint 5.

The plan satisfies all constraints and achieves the goal of pushing the stone to the goal location.

Let me finalize it and ensure all the action formats are correct:

1. "move player1 pos32 pos22 dirleft"
2. "move player1 pos22 pos12 dirleft"
3. "move player1 pos12 pos11 dirup"
4. "move player1 pos11 pos21 dirright"
5. "move player1 pos21 pos31 dirright"
6. "move player1 pos31 pos41 dirright"
7. "move player1 pos41 pos42 dirdown"
8. "move player1 pos42 pos43 dirdown"
9. "move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft"
10. "move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft"
11. "move player1 pos23 pos13 dirleft"
12. "move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown"
13. "move player1 pos14 pos24 dirright"
14. "move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright"

Regarding the action formats, they should match the provided formats:
- "move p l_from l_to d": Move agent p from location l_from to location l_to following direction d.
- "pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": Make agent p, situated at location l_p, push stone s from location l_from to goal location l_to, following direction d.
- "pushtonongoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": Make agent p, situated at location l_p, push stone s from location l_from to non-goal location l_to, following direction d.

Our actions match these formats, so I believe the plan is valid.
