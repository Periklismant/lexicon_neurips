The provided plan first moves the agent from the initial position (pos32) to pos34 via pos33. The agent then pushes stone1 from pos44 to the goal pos54. After achieving the main goal, the agent navigates through pos43, pos42, and pos41 to fulfill the constraint of occupying pos41. It then proceeds through pos31, pos21, pos11, pos12, and pos13 to satisfy the remaining constraints. The sequence ensures that pos33 and pos34 are each occupied in only one continuous segment, and all required locations (pos11/pos12, pos13, pos41) are visited. This plan is optimal in length while satisfying all constraints.
