Okay, let's try to figure out how to solve this planning problem. The goal is to get stone1, which is initially at pos44, to a goal location. The only goal location mentioned is pos54. So I need to move stone1 from pos44 to pos54.

First, the agent starts at pos32. The path from pos32 to pos44 might involve moving through several locations. Let me map out the possible moves. From pos32, the agent can go to pos22 (left), pos42 (right), pos31 (up), or pos33 (down). But the stone is at pos44, so the agent needs to get to a position adjacent to pos44 to push it. 

To push the stone to pos54 (which is right from pos44), the agent needs to be at pos44's left (pos43) or up (pos34) or down (pos45). But according to the movement directions, pos44 can be moved to from pos34 (right) or pos43 (down) or pos45 (up). Wait, looking at the "may move" statements: pos44 can be moved to from pos34 following direction dirright (since pos34 to pos44 is right), or from pos43 following dirdown (since pos43 is to the left of pos44, moving down would be to pos44?), wait maybe I need to check that again.

Wait, the movement directions might be a bit confusing. Let me check the connections. For example, "You may move from location pos44 to location pos54 following direction dirright". So pos44 to pos54 is right. So pos44's right is pos54, which is the goal. So to push the stone1 from pos44 to pos54, the agent needs to be at pos44's left (pos43) and push it right. Because pushing requires the agent to be adjacent to the stone and push in the direction towards the target. So the agent would be at pos43, pushing the stone from pos44 to pos54 (right direction). But wait, the action for pushtogoal requires that the agent is at l_p (the position adjacent to the stone's current position), and then the stone is pushed from l_from (pos44) to l_to (pos54) with direction d. So the direction here would be dirright. So the agent needs to be at pos44's left (pos43) to push it right. 

But how does the agent get to pos43 from pos32? Let's plan the path. Starting at pos32, possible moves are down to pos33, right to pos42, left to pos22, or up to pos31. To get to pos43, maybe the agent can move right to pos42, then down to pos43. Wait, pos42 can move down to pos43. Let's check: "You may move from location pos42 to location pos43 following direction dirdown". Yes. So from pos32, the agent can move right to pos42, then down to pos43. Then from pos43, the agent can push the stone at pos44 to pos54 using pushtogoal. Let's see if that's possible.

So the steps would be:
1. move player1 from pos32 to pos42 (direction dirright). Preconditions: pos42 is clear. According to the initial state, pos42 is clear. So yes.
2. move from pos42 to pos43 (direction dirdown). Preconditions: pos43 is clear. Initially, pos43 is clear. So that's possible.
3. Then perform pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos44 pos54 dirright. Check preconditions:
   - Agent is at pos43 (yes after step 2).
   - Stone1 is at pos44 (yes initially).
   - pos54 is clear (initially, pos54 is clear as per the original state).
   - Can move from pos43 to pos44 following dirright? Wait, the allowed movements: "You may move from location pos43 to location pos44 following direction dirdown". Wait, that seems conflicting. Let me check the movement again. For pos43, the possible moves are to pos33 (left), pos53 (right), pos42 (up), and pos44 (down). So moving from pos43 to pos44 is direction dirdown. So the direction from pos43 to pos44 is dirdown. But pushing the stone from pos44 to pos54 would require the direction dirright. Wait, but the action's direction is the direction from l_from to l_to. So for pushtogoal, l_from is pos44, l_to is pos54, direction is dirright. The preconditions for the action are: can get from l_p (pos43) to l_from (pos44) following direction d. Since the agent is at pos43, to get to pos44, the direction is dirdown. So the action would have l_p as pos43, l_from as pos44, l_to as pos54, direction dirright. Wait, but how does that work? Because the agent is at pos43, needs to push the stone from pos44 to pos54 (dirright). But pushing a stone requires the agent to be adjacent to the stone in the direction opposite to the push direction. So if the stone is at pos44, to push it right to pos54, the agent must be at pos44's left (pos43) and push right. So the direction d in the action is dirright. The movement from pos43 to pos44 is direction dirdown, but the push direction is dirright. 

Wait, the action's fourth argument is l_p (the agent's location before the action), which must be adjacent to l_from (stone's location). The direction from l_p to l_from must be d. So for the agent to push the stone from pos44 to pos54 (dirright), the agent must be at pos43 (left of pos44), and the direction from pos43 to pos44 is dirdown. Wait, no. Wait pos43 is to the left of pos44? No. The grid is 5x5, with pos11 to pos55. Let me imagine the grid:

Rows are pos1*, pos2*, pos3*, pos4*, pos5* (from top to bottom?), or columns? Wait, the problem says it's a 2D grid, but the actual layout isn't specified. However, looking at the movement directions, for example, pos11 can move to pos21 (dirright) or pos12 (dirdown). So dirright would be moving down a row, and dirdown would be moving right a column? Wait that's confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the grid is structured such that pos11 is row 1, column 1. Directions dirright would be moving to the next column (same row), dirleft previous column, dirdown next row, dirup previous row. So, for example, pos32 is row 3, column 2. Moving dirright would be to column 3, same row: pos33. Wait, but looking at the allowed movements: from pos32, you can move to pos22 (dirleft), pos42 (dirright), pos31 (dirup), pos33 (dirdown). Wait, that suggests that directions are as follows:

- dirleft: decreases the column by 1.
- dirright: increases the column by 1.
- dirup: decreases the row by 1.
- dirdown: increases the row by 1.

Wait, for example, pos32 (row3, column2) moving dirright would be column3, same row: pos33. But according to the movement allowed, from pos32, dirright is pos42. Wait that's confusing. Maybe the rows are numbered from top to bottom as 1 to 5, and columns from left to right as 1 to 5. So pos11 is top-left, pos15 is top-right, pos51 is bottom-left, pos55 is bottom-right. Then directions:

- dirright: move east (right in the same row)
- dirleft: move west
- dirup: move north (up to a lower row)
- dirdown: move south (down to a higher row)

Wait, but the movement from pos11 to pos21 is dirright. If pos11 is row1, column1, then moving dirright (east) would be to column2, same row: pos12. But according to the problem statement, "You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright". So pos11 to pos21 is dirright. That suggests that dirright increases the row number. That's different. So perhaps the directions are such that:

- dirright increases the row number by 1 (moving down a row)
- dirleft decreases the row number by 1 (moving up a row)
- dirdown increases the column by 1 (moving right a column)
- dirup decreases the column by 1 (moving left a column)

But that seems counterintuitive. Alternatively, the grid might be structured with pos11 as the top-left, and directions are as follows:

- dirright: move east (right) in the same row (column increases)
- dirleft: move west (left) in the same row (column decreases)
- dirdown: move south (down) in the same column (row increases)
- dirup: move north (up) in the same column (row decreases)

But according to the movement allowed from pos11: moving dirright goes to pos21. So pos11 to pos21 is dirright. If pos11 is row1, column1, then dirright would be same row, column+1, which would be pos12. But according to the problem, moving dirright from pos11 takes you to pos21, which is row2, column1. That suggests that dirright is moving down a row. So the directions might be:

- dirright: row increases by 1 (south)
- dirleft: row decreases by 1 (north)
- dirdown: column increases by 1 (east)
- dirup: column decreases by 1 (west)

But that's unconventional. Let's try to figure out the movement directions based on the given connections.

For pos11:

- You may move to pos21 (dirright)
- You may move to pos12 (dirdown)

So pos11 to pos21 is dirright (so dirright is moving down a row), and pos11 to pos12 is dirdown (moving right a column). That makes sense if:

- dirright: move down (row increases by 1)
- dirleft: move up (row decreases by 1)
- dirdown: move right (column increases by 1)
- dirup: move left (column decreases by 1)

So, for example:

pos11 (row1, column1) dirright → pos21 (row2, column1)
pos11 dirdown → pos12 (row1, column2)

Similarly, pos12 can move dirright to pos22 (down a row), dirup to pos11 (left a column), or dirdown to pos13 (right a column).

This seems to be the case. So the directions are:

- dirright: south (row increases)
- dirleft: north (row decreases)
- dirdown: east (column increases)
- dirup: west (column decreases)

So pos32 (row3, column2) can move:

- dirleft to pos22 (row2, column2)
- dirright to pos42 (row4, column2)
- dirup to pos31 (row3, column1)
- dirdown to pos33 (row3, column3)

Wait, no. Wait, the movement from pos32 is:

"You may move from location pos32 to location pos22 following direction dirleft": dirleft from pos32 (row3, column2) takes you to pos22 (row2, column2). So dirleft is row decreases by 1.

Similarly, "You may move from location pos32 to location pos42 following direction dirright": dirright from pos32 (row3) to pos42 (row4), same column.

"You may move from location pos32 to location pos31 following direction dirup": dirup from pos32 (column2) to pos31 (column1).

"You may move from location pos32 to location pos33 following direction dirdown": dirdown from pos32 (column2) to pos33 (column3).

So yes, directions:

- dirright: row +1 (south)
- dirleft: row -1 (north)
- dirdown: column +1 (east)
- dirup: column -1 (west)

So, the positions are structured as rows (first number) and columns (second number). For example, pos44 is row4, column4.

Now, the stone is at pos44 (row4, column4). The goal location is pos54 (row5, column4). To push the stone to pos54, the agent needs to be south of the stone (since pushing dirright would move the stone south, but wait, no. Wait, the direction in the push action is the direction from l_from to l_to. So, the stone is at pos44, and we want to push it to pos54. So l_from is pos44, l_to is pos54. The direction from pos44 to pos54 is dirright (since moving from row4 to row5 is dirright). So the agent needs to be at the position north of the stone (since to push south/dirright, the agent must be north of the stone. Wait, no. Because to push a stone south (dirright), the agent must be north of the stone. So the agent is at pos34 (row3, column4) and pushes the stone south to pos44's south, which is pos54 (row5, column4). Wait, pos44's south is row5, column4, which is pos54. So to push the stone from pos44 to pos54 (dirright), the agent must be at pos44's north (pos34), and push in dirright direction. 

So the action would be:

pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos44 pos54 dirright.

Wait, but the agent needs to be at pos34. So how does the agent get there from pos32?

The initial position is pos32 (row3, column2). The agent needs to move to pos34 (row3, column4). Let's plan that path.

From pos32, possible moves:

- dirleft (north) to pos22 (row2, column2)
- dirright (south) to pos42 (row4, column2)
- dirup (west) to pos31 (row3, column1)
- dirdown (east) to pos33 (row3, column3)

So from pos32, moving east (dirdown) to pos33. Then from pos33, east to pos34 (dirdown again). Wait, pos33 can move to pos34 via dirdown? Let's check:

Looking at the movement allowed for pos33: "You may move from location pos33 to location pos34 following direction dirdown". Yes, because dirdown increases the column. pos33 is column3, moving east (dirdown) to column4 (pos34). So from pos33, dirdown to pos34.

So the path would be:

pos32 → pos33 (dirdown)
pos33 → pos34 (dirdown)

Then, from pos34, the agent can push the stone from pos44 to pos54 (dirright).

But wait, the agent is at pos34 (row3, column4). To push the stone at pos44 (row4, column4) south to pos54 (row5, column4), the agent needs to be adjacent to the stone. The stone is at pos44 (row4, column4), so the agent must be at pos34 (row3, column4) to push it south (dirright). But wait, the preconditions for pushtogoal require that the agent can move from l_p (pos34) to l_from (pos44) following direction d. So direction d here would be dirright (since from pos34 to pos44 is dirright). Then, from pos44 to pos54 is also dirright. So the action would be:

pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos44 pos54 dirright.

But first, the agent needs to move to pos34.

So steps:

1. move player1 from pos32 to pos33 (dirdown)
2. move player1 from pos33 to pos34 (dirdown)
3. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos44 pos54 dirright.

But wait, when pushing, the agent moves from pos34 to pos44 (since after the push, the agent ends up at l_from (pos44). But after pushing, the stone moves to pos54. So after this action, the stone is at pos54 (goal), and the agent is at pos44.

But that would satisfy the goal. However, we need to check the constraints.

The constraints are:

- "Location pos33 is not clear" must hold in at most one continuous sequence.
- "Location pos34 is not clear" must hold in at most one continuous sequence.
- At least one state where pos11 or pos12 is not clear.
- At least one state where pos13 is not clear.
- At least one state where pos41 is not clear.

So we need to make sure that these constraints are satisfied in the plan.

First, the plan as outlined would involve:

After move to pos33 (step1), pos33 is not clear (since agent is there). Then step2 moves to pos34, so pos33 becomes clear again. So pos33 is not clear only during step1. Then step3, the agent is at pos34, then pushes to pos44. So during step3's execution, pos34 is not clear (agent is there before the action). After the action, the agent moves to pos44, so pos34 becomes clear. So the constraint on pos33 being not clear in at most one continuous sequence is satisfied (only during step1's effect). Similarly for pos34: during step2 and step3's execution, the agent is at pos34, but the sequence is from step2's move to step3's action. So from step2 to step3, pos34 is occupied. But how many continuous sequences? Let's see:

- After step1 (move to pos33), pos33 is occupied. Then step2 is moving from pos33 to pos34: this makes pos33 clear and pos34 occupied. So pos34 is occupied from step2 onwards. Then step3's action (pushtogoal) requires the agent to be at pos34. So after step2, the agent is at pos34. Then step3's action starts with the agent at pos34. After executing step3, the agent moves to pos44, so pos34 becomes clear. So the continuous sequence where pos34 is not clear is from step2 to step3. So that's two steps: during step2's effect (after moving to pos34) and during step3's execution (before the action completes). So the continuous sequence is from step2's end to step3's end. So that's a single continuous sequence (since after step2, pos34 is occupied; during step3's preconditions, it's still occupied, then after step3, pos34 is clear). So the constraint on pos34 is satisfied (at most one continuous sequence).

But what about the other constraints? The plan must also ensure that:

- At least one state has pos11 or pos12 not clear.
- At least one state has pos13 not clear.
- At least one state has pos41 not clear.

In the current plan, the agent moves from pos32 → pos33 → pos34 → pos44. None of these locations are pos11, pos12, pos13, or pos41. So these locations remain clear throughout. Thus, the constraints are not satisfied. So we need to adjust the plan to include actions that cause these locations to be occupied at least once.

This complicates things. So the agent has to visit pos11, pos12, pos13, or pos41 at some point, but then leave them to allow other moves. However, the optimal plan should be as short as possible, so we need to find the minimal path that includes these required states.

Let's think: how can we make sure that at least one of pos11 or pos12 is not clear (i.e., the agent is there) at some point. Similarly for pos13 and pos41.

But the agent's path to push the stone doesn't naturally go through these locations. So we need to detour.

But adding detours will increase the plan length. The challenge is to find the minimal path that satisfies all constraints.

Alternative approach: Maybe after moving the stone to the goal, the agent can visit the required locations. But the problem states that the goal is to have the stone at a goal location, but the constraints must be satisfied during the plan. So the constraints don't have to hold in the final state, just at some state during the execution.

So the plan could be:

1. Move agent to pos34 and push the stone to pos54 (as before).
2. Then, move the agent to pos11, pos12, etc., to satisfy the constraints.

But pushing the stone is the main goal. However, this would make the plan longer. But perhaps there's a way to combine the required detours with the path to push the stone.

Alternatively, maybe during the movement to pos34, the agent can pass through pos41, pos13, etc.

Wait, let's see. The agent starts at pos32. To reach pos34, the path could be pos32 → pos33 → pos34. But to get to pos41, the agent would need to move dirright from pos31 to pos41. So, perhaps a detour:

pos32 → pos31 (dirup), then pos31 → pos41 (dirright). Then from pos41, move back to pos31, then to pos32, etc. But this would add steps.

Alternatively, perhaps after pushing the stone, the agent can move to pos41. But pos41 is not a goal location, and it's clear initially.

But this would add steps. The constraints require that:

- At least one state has pos13 not clear.

So the agent must be at pos13 at some point.

Similarly, at least one state has pos41 not clear.

So the plan must include the agent visiting pos13 and pos41, even if temporarily.

But how to do this with minimal steps.

Wait, maybe after pushing the stone, the agent is at pos44. Then, the agent can move to pos45 (dirdown), then to pos55 (dirright?), but that's not helpful. Alternatively, from pos44, the agent can move left to pos43 (dirleft?), but movement from pos44: allowed moves are to pos34 (dirleft), pos54 (dirright), pos43 (dirup?), etc. Wait, according to the movement allowed for pos44:

"You may move from location pos44 to location pos34 following direction dirleft" (dirleft is row-1, so from row4 to row3: pos34).

"You may move from location pos44 to location pos54 following direction dirright" (row5, column4).

"You may move from location pos44 to location pos43 following direction dirup" (column-1, so column3: pos43).

"You may move from location pos44 to location pos45 following direction dirdown" (column+1: column5? pos45 is row4, column5).

So after pushing the stone to pos54, the agent is at pos44. Then, the agent needs to move to pos41 (row4, column1). How?

From pos44, the agent can move dirup (column-1) to pos43 (row4, column3), then dirup to pos42 (row4, column2), then dirup to pos41 (row4, column1). So that's three moves.

But this would add steps after the main goal is achieved. But the constraints require that pos41 is not clear in at least one state, so the agent must be there. Similarly for pos13 and pos11/pos12.

But this approach would make the plan longer. However, maybe there's a way to visit some of these locations during the initial movement to pos34.

Alternative idea: Instead of going directly from pos32 to pos33 to pos34, take a detour through pos41 and pos13.

But that seems inefficient. Let's think of the minimal steps.

Let's outline all constraints:

1. pos33 not clear in at most one continuous sequence.
2. pos34 not clear in at most one continuous sequence.
3. At least one state where pos11 or pos12 is not clear.
4. At least one state where pos13 is not clear.
5. At least one state where pos41 is not clear.

So, the agent must visit pos11, pos12, or both; pos13; and pos41.

The optimal plan would need to include these visits in the fewest steps possible.

Alternative approach: After moving to pos34 and pushing the stone, the agent can visit pos13, pos41, and pos11/pos12. But this would add steps after the main goal. Alternatively, during the path to pos34, the agent can detour to these locations.

For example, from pos32, move to pos31 (dirup), then to pos41 (dirright). Then from pos41, move to pos42 (dirdown), then to pos43 (dirdown), then to pos44 (dirdown), but wait, pos44 has the stone initially. So the agent can't move into pos44 unless it's clear. But in the initial state, pos44 has the stone, so it's not clear. So the agent can't move there directly. So that path is blocked.

Alternatively, from pos41, the agent could move back to pos31, then to pos32, then proceed to pos33 and pos34. But this would add steps.

Alternatively, during the movement to pos34, the agent could go via pos22, pos23, etc., but that seems longer.

Alternatively, after pushing the stone, the agent is at pos44. Then, the agent can move to pos43 (dirup), then pos42 (dirup), pos41 (dirup) → satisfies pos41. Then from pos41, move to pos51 (dirright), then pos52 (dirdown), pos53 (dirdown), pos54 (dirdown), but that's not necessary. Alternatively, from pos41, move back to pos31, then to pos32, then pos33, etc. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, after pushing the stone, the agent is at pos44. Then:

Step4: move from pos44 to pos43 (dirup)
Step5: move from pos43 to pos33 (dirleft)
Step6: move from pos33 to pos23 (dirleft)
Step7: move from pos23 to pos13 (dirleft)
Step8: move from pos13 to pos12 (dirup)
Step9: move from pos12 to pos11 (dirup)

But this adds 6 steps after the main goal. However, this would satisfy pos13 and pos11/pos12 being occupied. Then, the agent would also need to visit pos41. So from pos11, the agent could move to pos21 (dirright), then pos31 (dirright), pos41 (dirright). That's three more steps. But this would be very long.

This seems impractical. Let's think of a smarter way.

Wait, maybe during the initial movement to pos34, the agent can visit pos41, pos13, and pos11/pos12 in a way that doesn't add too many steps.

For example, starting at pos32:

1. move dirup to pos31 (column1, row3)
2. move dirright to pos41 (row4, column1)
   - Now pos41 is occupied (satisfies constraint)
3. move dirup to pos31 (dirleft? Wait, pos41 can move to pos31 via dirleft (row-1). So step3: move from pos41 to pos31 (dirleft)
4. move dirdown to pos32 (from pos31 to pos32 is dirdown? pos31 can move to pos32 via dirdown (column+1). So step4: pos31 → pos32 (dirdown)
5. Then proceed to pos33 → pos34 as before.

So steps 1-4 would add visits to pos41 and pos31, but pos41 is now satisfied. But this adds four steps before the main action. Then the agent would need to visit pos13 and pos11/pos12.

Alternatively, after step4 (back at pos32), proceed to move to pos33, pos34, push the stone. Then from pos44, move to pos43, pos33, pos23, pos13 (to satisfy pos13), then to pos12 (satisfy pos12).

But this would add steps after the main goal. However, the constraints require that these locations are not clear in at least one state, not necessarily all at the same time. So visiting them in sequence would satisfy each constraint.

But this makes the plan very long. The user wants the optimal plan with minimal length. So we need to find a way to satisfy all constraints in as few steps as possible.

Alternative idea: Maybe during the movement to pos34, the agent can pass through pos13 and pos41. But how?

Another approach: The agent can move from pos32 to pos22 (dirleft), then to pos23 (dirdown), then to pos13 (dirleft), then to pos12 (dirup), then to pos11 (dirup). Then go back to pos12, pos13, etc. But this is a long detour.

Alternatively, after pushing the stone, the agent can move to pos54 (if possible), but pos54 is a goal location, but it's clear. Wait, after pushing the stone to pos54, pos54 is no longer clear. But the agent is at pos44. To move to pos54, the agent would need to go through pos44 → pos54 via dirright, but pos54 is occupied by the stone. So the agent can't move there. So after pushing, the agent is at pos44.

Hmm.

This is getting complicated. Let's consider the constraints again. We need to have at least one state where:

- pos11 or pos12 is not clear.
- pos13 is not clear.
- pos41 is not clear.

So, the agent needs to be in these locations at some point.

But the agent's path from pos32 to pos34 can be modified to include these locations. Let's try to find a path that includes pos41, pos13, and pos12.

For example:

Start at pos32.

1. move to pos31 (dirup) → pos31 is occupied.
2. move to pos41 (dirright) → pos41 is occupied (satisfies pos41 constraint).
3. move to pos31 (dirleft) → pos41 is clear.
4. move to pos32 (dirdown) → pos31 is clear.
5. move to pos33 (dirdown) → pos33 is occupied.
6. move to pos34 (dirdown) → pos34 is occupied.
7. pushtogoal → pos34 becomes clear, pos44 is occupied.

Now, after step7, the stone is at pos54 (goal), and the agent is at pos44.

Now, we need to satisfy pos13 and pos11/pos12.

From pos44, the agent can move:

8. move to pos43 (dirup)
9. move to pos33 (dirleft)
10. move to pos23 (dirleft)
11. move to pos13 (dirleft) → pos13 is occupied (satisfies pos13 constraint).
12. move to pos12 (dirup) → pos12 is occupied (satisfies pos11/pos12 constraint).
13. move to pos11 (dirup) → pos11 is occupied (also satisfies pos11/pos12).

Then, the agent can stop here.

So total steps: 13. But this is very long. But the user wants an optimal plan, which is as short as possible.

But there must be a shorter way. Let's think again.

Wait, perhaps during the movement from pos32 to pos34, the agent can take a detour that covers pos41 and pos13 in fewer steps.

For example:

1. pos32 → pos42 (dirright) → pos42 is occupied.
2. pos42 → pos43 (dirdown) → pos43 is occupied.
3. pos43 → pos44 (dirdown) → but pos44 has the stone, which is not clear. So this is not possible.

Alternatively:

1. pos32 → pos42 (dirright)
2. pos42 → pos41 (dirup) → satisfies pos41.
3. pos41 → pos31 (dirleft)
4. pos31 → pos32 (dirdown)
5. pos32 → pos33 (dirdown)
6. pos33 → pos34 (dirdown)
7. pushtogoal.

Now, steps 1-7: in step2, pos41 is occupied. Then, after step7, the agent is at pos44. Now, need to cover pos13 and pos11/pos12.

From pos44:

8. pos44 → pos34 (dirleft)
9. pos34 → pos33 (dirup)
10. pos33 → pos23 (dirleft)
11. pos23 → pos13 (dirleft) → pos13 occupied.
12. pos13 → pos12 (dirup) → pos12 occupied.
13. pos12 → pos11 (dirup) → pos11 occupied.

This adds 6 steps after the main action, total of 13 steps. Still too long.

Alternatively, maybe after step7 (pushtogoal), the agent can move to pos43, then to pos33, pos23, pos13, then pos12, pos11. But this is still 6 steps.

Is there a way to visit pos13 and pos11/pos12 while moving towards pos34?

For example:

pos32 → pos22 (dirleft)
pos22 → pos23 (dirdown)
pos23 → pos13 (dirleft)
pos13 → pos12 (dirup)
pos12 → pos11 (dirup)
Then back to pos12 → pos13 → pos23 → pos24 → pos34 → ... 

But this would be a very long path, and also requires moving back.

This seems impractical.

Another approach: Maybe the agent can push the stone to pos54 in a different way that allows passing through pos13 and pos41.

But how?

Alternatively, the agent could push the stone from pos44 to pos54 via a different path. For example, first push the stone west to pos43, then south to pos53, then east to pos54. But pos54 is a goal, so this may not be efficient. Also, the agent would need to navigate around.

But pos43 is not a goal, so pushing to pos43 would require using pushtonongoal. But pos54 is the only goal. So the stone must end at pos54.

Alternatively, perhaps the agent can push the stone east from pos44 to pos54 directly, as before, but then find a way to visit the required locations in the process.

But I'm not seeing a shorter path. The minimal steps to achieve the goal and satisfy all constraints seem to involve a lot of steps. But perhaps there's a smarter way.

Wait, the constraint for pos33 and pos34 being not clear for at most one continuous sequence. If the agent passes through pos33 and pos34 once, that's okay. But if they are visited multiple times, that could violate the constraints.

But in the initial plan where the agent goes straight to pos34, pos33 is occupied only once (during step1), and pos34 once (steps2-3), which is allowed.

Now, the main issue is satisfying the other constraints.

Wait, perhaps the agent can visit pos41 and pos13 during the same trip.

For example:

After pushing the stone to pos54, the agent is at pos44. Then:

1. Move from pos44 to pos43 (dirup)
2. Move from pos43 to pos33 (dirleft)
3. Move from pos33 to pos23 (dirleft)
4. Move from pos23 to pos13 (dirleft) → pos13 is occupied (satisfies constraint)
5. Move from pos13 to pos12 (dirup) → pos12 is occupied (satisfies pos11/pos12)
6. Move from pos12 to pos11 (dirup) → pos11 is occupied (also satisfies pos11/12)
7. Move from pos11 to pos21 (dirright)
8. Move from pos21 to pos31 (dirright)
9. Move from pos31 to pos41 (dirright) → pos41 is occupied (satisfies constraint)
10. Move from pos41 to pos31 (dirleft)
11. Move from pos31 to pos32 (dirdown)
12. Move from pos32 to pos42 (dirright)
13. Move from pos42 to pos43 (dirdown)
14. Move from pos43 to pos44 (dirdown)
15. Then do the pushtogoal (but the stone is already at pos54).

Wait, but this is after the main goal. So the steps after pushing are just to satisfy the constraints, which may be necessary.

But this is very long. The optimal plan must be as short as possible, so perhaps there's a way to combine some of these steps.

Alternatively, maybe the agent can visit pos41 on the way to pos34.

For example:

pos32 → pos31 (dirup) → pos31 is occupied.
pos31 → pos41 (dirright) → pos41 is occupied.
pos41 → pos31 (dirleft)
pos31 → pos32 (dirdown)
pos32 → pos33 (dirdown)
pos33 → pos34 (dirdown)
push.

Now, during this path, pos41 is occupied (step2). Then, after pushing, the agent needs to visit pos13 and pos11/12.

From pos44:

pos44 → pos43 (dirup)
pos43 → pos33 (dirleft)
pos33 → pos23 (dirleft)
pos23 → pos13 (dirleft) → pos13 occupied.
pos13 → pos12 (dirup) → pos12 occupied.
pos12 → pos11 (dirup) → pos11 occupied.

This adds 6 steps after the main action. So total steps: 2 (to pos41) + 5 (main action) +6 (after) = 13 steps. But this is too long.

Is there a way to visit pos13 and pos11/12 during the initial movement?

For example:

pos32 → pos33 (dirdown)
pos33 → pos34 (dirdown)
push to pos54 → agent at pos44.

Then, agent moves:

pos44 → pos43 (dirup)
pos43 → pos33 (dirleft)
pos33 → pos23 (dirleft)
pos23 → pos13 (dirleft) → pos13 occupied.
pos13 → pos12 (dirup) → pos12 occupied.
pos12 → pos11 (dirup) → pos11 occupied.
pos11 → pos21 (dirright)
pos21 → pos31 (dirright)
pos31 → pos41 (dirright) → pos41 occupied.
pos41 → ... 

But this would be many steps. The user wants the optimal plan with minimal length. This suggests that there's a more efficient way that I'm missing.

Alternative idea: Maybe the constraints can be satisfied in the initial steps before pushing the stone.

For example, the agent can first visit pos41, then pos13, then pos12, and then proceed to push the stone.

Let's outline:

1. pos32 → pos31 (dirup)
2. pos31 → pos41 (dirright) → satisfies pos41.
3. pos41 → pos31 (dirleft)
4. pos31 → pos32 (dirdown)
5. pos32 → pos33 (dirdown)
6. pos33 → pos23 (dirleft)
7. pos23 → pos13 (dirleft) → satisfies pos13.
8. pos13 → pos12 (dirup) → satisfies pos11/12.
9. pos12 → pos13 (dirdown)
10. pos13 → pos23 (dirright)
11. pos23 → pos24 (dirdown)
12. pos24 → pos34 (dirright)
13. pos34 → pos44 (dirright) → but pos44 has the stone. Wait, the agent can't move into pos44 because it's occupied by the stone. So this path is blocked.

Alternatively, after step8, the agent is at pos12. Then, move to pos22 (dirright), then pos32 (dirright), then pos42 (dirright), then pos43 (dirdown), then pos44 (dirdown), but pos44 is occupied by the stone. So that's not possible.

Hmm. This seems tricky. Maybe there's a way to visit pos41 and pos13 on the way to pos34.

For example:

1. pos32 → pos31 (dirup)
2. pos31 → pos41 (dirright) → pos41 occupied.
3. pos41 → pos31 (dirleft)
4. pos31 → pos32 (dirdown)
5. pos32 → pos33 (dirdown)
6. pos33 → pos34 (dirdown)
7. pushtogoal → stone at pos54.

Now, the agent is at pos44. Then:

8. pos44 → pos43 (dirup)
9. pos43 → pos33 (dirleft)
10. pos33 → pos23 (dirleft)
11. pos23 → pos13 (dirleft) → pos13 occupied.
12. pos13 → pos12 (dirup) → pos12 occupied.

This way, steps 2 (pos41), step11 (pos13), step12 (pos12) satisfy all the constraints. The total steps would be 12 actions. Still quite long.

But the user wants the optimal plan with minimal steps. I must be missing a smarter way.

Wait, perhaps the agent can visit pos13 and pos41 during the initial movement, and also push the stone in a way that covers pos11/12.

Alternatively, let's think about the constraints:

- pos33 and pos34 can't be occupied for more than one continuous sequence. So if the agent passes through them once, it's okay.

But the minimal path to push the stone is 3 steps: move to pos33, move to pos34, push.

But the constraints require visiting pos41, pos13, and pos11/12. So how to fit those into 3 steps plus some extra steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the agent can push the stone in a way that requires passing through pos41 or pos13.

But how? For example, if the stone is at pos44, the agent needs to be at pos34 to push it south. The agent's path to pos34 could involve passing through pos41 and pos13, but that seems impossible due to the grid layout.

Another idea: Maybe the agent can use the pushtonongoal action to move the stone to a non-goal location first, and then to the goal, but that would require more steps and might not be optimal.

Alternatively, perhaps the agent can push the stone to pos54 via pos43 and pos53, but pos53 is not a goal. So that's not helpful.

Wait, the only goal is pos54. So the stone must end up there.

This is very challenging. Let's consider the constraints again. The constraints are:

1. pos33 and pos34 each must not be occupied for more than one continuous sequence.

2. At least one state where pos11/pos12 is occupied.

3. At least one state where pos13 is occupied.

4. At least one state where pos41 is occupied.

So, the agent needs to visit these four locations (pos11/12, pos13, pos41) at least once during the plan.

The minimal plan would have to include these visits in the fewest steps possible. Let's think of visiting them in a single path.

For example:

Start at pos32.

1. move to pos31 (dirup)
2. move to pos41 (dirright) → satisfies pos41.
3. move to pos42 (dirdown)
4. move to pos43 (dirdown)
5. move to pos44 (dirdown) → but pos44 is occupied by stone, so can't move here. So step5 is impossible.

Alternative path after step2 (pos41):

3. move to pos31 (dirleft)
4. move to pos32 (dirdown)
5. move to pos33 (dirdown)
6. move to pos34 (dirdown)
7. pushtogoal.

Then, from pos44:

8. move to pos43 (dirup)
9. move to pos33 (dirleft)
10. move to pos23 (dirleft)
11. move to pos13 (dirleft) → satisfies pos13.
12. move to pos12 (dirup) → satisfies pos11/12.

This gives us 12 steps. But this is still long.

Is there a way to combine some of these steps? For example, after step7 (pushtogoal), the agent is at pos44. From there, move to pos43 (dirup), then to pos33 (dirleft), pos23 (dirleft), pos13 (dirleft), pos12 (dirup), pos11 (dirup). That's 5 steps after the main action. Then, steps 1-7 are 7 steps, total 12.

But the optimal plan must be the shortest possible. Perhaps there's a way to satisfy multiple constraints in a single step.

Wait, for example, visiting pos41 and pos13 in the same plan. But they are far apart.

Alternatively, maybe the agent can visit pos41 and pos13 in a single loop.

But I can't think of a way to do that without adding many steps.

Another idea: Perhaps the agent can push the stone in a way that leaves it in a position that allows visiting the required locations more easily.

For example, pushing the stone to pos54 first, then moving around. But after pushing, the agent is at pos44, which is clear. Then, the agent can move freely.

So after the main action (pushtogoal), the agent is at pos44. Then:

1. move from pos44 to pos43 (dirup)
2. move to pos33 (dirleft)
3. move to pos23 (dirleft)
4. move to pos13 (dirleft) → pos13 occupied.
5. move to pos12 (dirup) → pos12 occupied.
6. move to pos11 (dirup) → pos11 occupied.
7. move to pos21 (dirright)
8. move to pos31 (dirright)
9. move to pos41 (dirright) → pos41 occupied.

This is 9 steps after the main action, total steps: 3 (main action) +9 =12.

But this is too long.

Alternatively, after pushing, the agent can move to pos43, then to pos42, pos41 (dirup), satisfying pos41 in step3. Then, from pos41, move back to pos42, pos43, pos33, pos23, pos13 (steps4-7), then to pos12 (step8). This would be 8 steps after the main action.

Total steps: 3 +8 =11.

Still, it's long.

But perhaps the constraints can be satisfied in the initial steps. For example, before pushing the stone, the agent can visit pos41, pos13, and pos12.

But how?

Start at pos32.

1. move to pos31 (dirup)
2. move to pos41 (dirright) → pos41 occupied.
3. move to pos31 (dirleft)
4. move to pos32 (dirdown)
5. move to pos33 (dirdown)
6. move to pos34 (dirdown)
7. pushtogoal → pos54.

Now, after step7, the agent is at pos44. Then:

8. move to pos43 (dirup)
9. move to pos33 (dirleft)
10. move to pos23 (dirleft)
11. move to pos13 (dirleft) → pos13 occupied.
12. move to pos12 (dirup) → pos12 occupied.

This is 12 steps. But this satisfies all constraints:

- pos41: step2.
- pos13: step11.
- pos12: step12.

So in this plan, steps 2,11,12 satisfy the constraints.

But this is 12 steps. Can we make it shorter?

Let me count the steps:

Steps 1-7: pushing the stone (7 steps).
Steps 8-12: visiting pos13 and pos12 (5 steps).

Total 12 steps.

But maybe there's a way to visit pos13 and pos12 in fewer steps.

For example, from pos44:

8. move to pos34 (dirleft)
9. move to pos24 (dirleft)
10. move to pos23 (dirup)
11. move to pos13 (dirleft) → pos13 occupied.
12. move to pos12 (dirup) → pos12 occupied.

This would be steps 8-12 as 5 steps, same as before.

Alternatively, from pos44, move to pos43 (dirup), then to pos33 (dirleft), pos23 (dirleft), pos13 (dirleft), pos12 (dirup). That's 5 steps.

No way to shorten it.

Thus, the minimal plan seems to be around 12 steps. But perhaps there's a way to combine some steps.

Wait, the initial movement to pos34 (steps5-6) could be done in two steps. Then the main action is step7. Then steps8-12 are 5 steps. Total 7+5=12 steps.

But the user wants the optimal plan with minimal length. Is there a way to have fewer steps?

Alternative idea: Maybe the agent can visit pos13 and pos12 on the way to pos34.

For example:

pos32 → pos33 (dirdown)
pos33 → pos23 (dirleft)
pos23 → pos13 (dirleft) → pos13 occupied.
pos13 → pos12 (dirup) → pos12 occupied.
pos12 → pos22 (dirright)
pos22 → pos32 (dirright)
pos32 → pos42 (dirright)
pos42 → pos43 (dirdown)
pos43 → pos44 (dirdown) → but pos44 is occupied by the stone. So this path is blocked.

This doesn't work.

Another approach: Perhaps the agent can visit pos41, pos13, and pos12 in the same path.

For example:

pos32 → pos31 (dirup)
pos31 → pos41 (dirright) → pos41 occupied.
pos41 → pos31 (dirleft)
pos31 → pos21 (dirleft)
pos21 → pos11 (dirleft)
pos11 → pos12 (dirdown) → pos12 occupied.
pos12 → pos13 (dirdown) → pos13 occupied.
pos13 → pos23 (dirright)
pos23 → pos24 (dirdown)
pos24 → pos34 (dirright)
pos34 → pos44 (dirright) → occupied by stone. Can't move there.

So this path is blocked at pos44.

Hmm. This is really challenging. Maybe the optimal plan is 12 steps as previously outlined.

But the user's problem states that the plan must be optimal, i.e., the shortest possible. So perhaps there's a way to do it in fewer steps.

Let me think again. The initial plan to push the stone requires 3 steps:

move to pos33, move to pos34, push.

But to satisfy the constraints, the agent must visit pos41, pos13, and pos11/12.

What if the agent visits pos41 and pos13 during the same trip before pushing the stone, and then pos11/12 after?

For example:

1. pos32 → pos31 (dirup)
2. pos31 → pos41 (dirright) → pos41 occupied.
3. pos41 → pos31 (dirleft)
4. pos31 → pos32 (dirdown)
5. pos32 → pos33 (dirdown)
6. pos33 → pos34 (dirdown)
7. pushtogoal → pos44.

Now, steps 1-7: pos41 is visited.

Then, from pos44:

8. pos44 → pos43 (dirup)
9. pos43 → pos33 (dirleft)
10. pos33 → pos23 (dirleft)
11. pos23 → pos13 (dirleft) → pos13 occupied.
12. pos13 → pos12 (dirup) → pos12 occupied.

This is 12 steps. But is there a way to combine steps?

Wait, after step7, the agent is at pos44. Then, moving to pos43 (step8) and then to pos33 (step9), pos23 (step10), pos13 (step11), pos12 (step12), pos11 (step13).

But this adds 6 steps after the main action, totaling 13 steps.

I think this is the minimal way to satisfy all constraints. However, maybe there's a way to visit pos13 and pos12 in fewer steps.

Another idea: After pushing the stone, the agent is at pos44. Then:

8. pos44 → pos43 (dirup)
9. pos43 → pos33 (dirleft)
10. pos33 → pos23 (dirleft)
11. pos23 → pos13 (dirleft) → pos13 occupied.
12. pos13 → pos12 (dirup) → pos12 occupied.

This is 5 steps after the main action (steps8-12). So total steps: 7 +5 =12.

But the user wants the optimal plan. Is 12 steps the minimal possible?

Alternatively, perhaps the agent can visit pos41 and pos13 in the same path.

For example:

1. pos32 → pos42 (dirright)
2. pos42 → pos43 (dirdown)
3. pos43 → pos44 (dirdown) → but pos44 is occupied by the stone. Can't move here.

No, that's blocked.

Another idea: The agent can move from pos32 to pos42 (dirright), then to pos43 (dirdown), then to pos33 (dirleft), then to pos23 (dirleft), pos13 (dirleft), pos12 (dirup), pos11 (dirup), then back to pos12, pos13, pos23, pos24, pos34, and then push. But this would require passing through pos34 after visiting pos11, which is a long path.

This is getting too time-consuming. Given the time constraints, I think the best approach is to outline the initial plan of pushing the stone and then adding the necessary steps to meet the constraints, even if it results in a longer plan. However, perhaps there's a shorter way that I'm missing.

Wait, perhaps the agent can visit pos13 and pos12 while moving towards pos34.

For example:

pos32 → pos33 (dirdown)
pos33 → pos23 (dirleft)
pos23 → pos13 (dirleft) → pos13 occupied.
pos13 → pos12 (dirup) → pos12 occupied.
pos12 → pos22 (dirright)
pos22 → pos32 (dirright)
pos32 → pos42 (dirright)
pos42 → pos43 (dirdown)
pos43 → pos44 (dirdown) → blocked by stone.
pos44 is occupied by the stone, so can't move there. So this path is invalid.

Alternatively, from pos12, move to pos22 (dirright), then to pos32 (dirright), then to pos42 (dirright), pos43 (dirdown), pos33 (dirleft), pos34 (dirdown), and push. But this is a very long path.

I think the minimal plan, given the constraints, is as follows:

```
move player1 pos32 pos33 dirdown
move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown
pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos44 pos54 dirright
move player1 pos44 pos43 dirup
move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft
move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft
move player1 pos23 pos13 dirleft
move player1 pos13 pos12 dirup
move player1 pos12 pos22 dirdown
move player1 pos22 pos32 dirright
move player1 pos32 pos42 dirright
move player1 pos42 pos41 dirup
```

But wait, let's check each step:

1. move player1 from pos32 to pos33 (dirdown) → pos33 not clear.
2. move to pos34 → pos34 not clear.
3. pushtogoal: agent moves from pos34 to pos44, stone to pos54. pos34 becomes clear.
4. move from pos44 to pos43 (dirup) → pos43 not clear.
5. move to pos33 → pos33 not clear again (but the constraint allows this as long as it's not more than one continuous sequence. But here, pos33 is occupied in step1 and step5. These are separate sequences, so this would violate the constraint because pos33 is not clear in two separate sequences. The constraint says it must be not clear in at most one continuous sequence. So having two separate sequences would violate the constraint.

Ah, this is a problem. The constraint for pos33 is that it can't be not clear (occupied) for more than one continuous sequence. So if the agent moves into pos33, leaves, then moves back, that's two separate sequences, which violates the constraint.

So the initial plan of moving back into pos33 after the push would violate the constraint. Therefore, this approach is invalid.

Thus, the agent must not occupy pos33 more than once in a continuous sequence.

This complicates things. So the agent's path must ensure that pos33 is occupied only once continuously.

Similarly for pos34.

So, the initial plan where the agent moves through pos33 and pos34 once is okay. But any return to these locations would violate the constraints.

Thus, the agent must find a way to visit pos41, pos13, and pos12 without passing through pos33 or pos34 again.

This makes the problem even harder.

So, after pushing the stone to pos54 and being at pos44, the agent must avoid pos33 and pos34.

So, from pos44, the agent can move to pos43 (dirup), then to pos42 (dirup), then to pos41 (dirup), satisfying pos41.

Then, from pos41, the agent can move to pos31 (dirleft), then to pos21 (dirleft), then to pos11 (dirleft), then to pos12 (dirdown), then to pos13 (dirdown), satisfying pos12 and pos13.

But this path would be:

1. move player1 pos32 pos33 dirdown
2. move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown
3. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos44 pos54 dirright
4. move player1 pos44 pos43 dirup
5. move player1 pos43 pos42 dirup
6. move player1 pos42 pos41 dirup → pos41 occupied.
7. move player1 pos41 pos31 dirleft
8. move player1 pos31 pos21 dirleft
9. move player1 pos21 pos11 dirleft → pos11 occupied.
10. move player1 pos11 pos12 dirdown → pos12 occupied.
11. move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown → pos13 occupied.

This plan would have 11 steps. However, steps 1 and 2 occupy pos33 and pos34, each once. Then steps4-11 avoid pos33 and pos34. This satisfies the constraints for pos33 and pos34.

Let's check the constraints:

- pos33 is occupied during step1. After step2, pos33 is clear. Then step4-11 don't involve pos33, so pos33 is only not clear in one continuous sequence (step1).

- pos34 is occupied during step2-3. After step3, pos34 is clear. So one continuous sequence.

The other constraints:

- pos11 or pos12 is occupied in step9 and step10.

- pos13 is occupied in step11.

- pos41 is occupied in step6.

Thus, all constraints are satisfied.

This plan has 11 steps. Is there a shorter way?

Let's see:

Steps 1-3: push the stone to goal (3 steps).

Steps 4-6: move to pos41 (3 steps).

Steps 7-11: move to pos11, pos12, pos13 (5 steps).

Total 3+3+5=11 steps.

Is there a way to reduce this?

For example, after step6 (pos41), can the agent move directly to pos11 without going through pos31 and pos21?

From pos41, the allowed moves are to pos31 (dirleft), pos51 (dirright), pos42 (dirdown), or pos41 to pos31.

To reach pos11 from pos41, the agent must move left (dirleft) to pos31, then to pos21, then to pos11.

So steps7-9 are necessary.

Alternatively, from pos41, move to pos42 (dirdown), then to pos43 (dirdown), but that's not helpful.

No, the path to pos11 from pos41 requires steps through pos31 and pos21.

Thus, the minimal plan is 11 steps.

But wait, in step10, the agent moves from pos11 to pos12 (dirdown). Then step11 from pos12 to pos13 (dirdown). This satisfies pos12 and pos13.

Yes.

So the plan would be:

```
move player1 pos32 pos33 dirdown
move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown
pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos44 pos54 dirright
move player1 pos44 pos43 dirup
move player1 pos43 pos42 dirup
move player1 pos42 pos41 dirup
move player1 pos41 pos31 dirleft
move player1 pos31 pos21 dirleft

This plan has 11 steps, satisfies all constraints:

- pos33 is occupied once (step1).

- pos34 occupied once (steps2-3).

- pos41 occupied (step6).

- pos13 occupied (step11).

- pos12 occupied (step10).

This seems to meet all the requirements. However, it's 11 steps. Is there a shorter way?

Let me count the steps again:

1. move to pos33
2. move to pos34
3. push to pos54
4. move to pos43
5. move to pos42
6. move to pos41
7. move to pos31
8. move to pos21
9. move to pos11
10. move to pos12
11. move to pos13

Yes, 11 steps.

But perhaps there's a way to combine some steps. For example, from pos44, moving to pos43, then pos42, then pos41 in 3 steps. Then from pos41 to pos31, pos21, pos11, pos12, pos13 in 5 steps. Total 8 steps after the push. So 3 (push) + 8 = 11 steps.

I think this is the shortest possible. The user's problem requires an optimal plan, so this is likely the correct answer.
