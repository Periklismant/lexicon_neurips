Let me understand the problem:

1. We have a 2D grid with positions like pos11, pos12, etc., representing a grid with 5 rows and 5 columns.
2. We have a player (player1) and a stone (stone1).
3. The initial state has the player at pos55 and the stone at pos43.
4. The goal is to move the stone to a goal location. The only goal location is pos11.

Let's map the grid for clarity:
```
pos11 pos12 pos13 pos14 pos15
pos21 pos22 pos23 pos24 pos25
pos31 pos32 pos33 pos34 pos35
pos41 pos42 pos43 pos44 pos45
pos51 pos52 pos53 pos54 pos55
```

Our initial state has player1 at pos55 and stone1 at pos43:
```
   G  .   .   .   .
   .  .   .   .   .
   .  .   .   .   .
   .  .   S   .   .
   .  .   .   .   P
```

where G is the goal location (pos11), S is the stone (pos43), and P is the player (pos55).

We need to move the stone to the goal location (pos11), but we also have several constraints:

1. We need to have the stone at pos23 at some point, and then the player needs to be at pos34 at the same time or later.
2. We need to have the player at pos13 at some point, and then the player needs to be at pos55 at the same time or later.
3. We need to have the stone at pos43 at some point (this is already satisfied in the initial state), and then either pos42 should not be clear or the stone should be at pos45.
4. We need to have either pos34 or pos31 not be clear at some point.
5. We need to have the player at pos23 at some point, and then the player needs to be at pos41 at the same time or later.

Let's think about the constraints and plan accordingly:

1. We need to push the stone to pos23 at some point. The stone starts at pos43, so we need to push it from there to pos33, then to pos23.
2. After the stone is at pos23, we need to have the player at pos34 at some point.
3. We need to have the player at pos13 at some point, and later at pos55.
4. After the stone is at pos43 (which is already the case), we need to either have pos42 not clear (which means either the player or the stone is there) or have the stone at pos45.
5. We need to have either pos34 or pos31 not clear at some point. This could be achieved by having the player or the stone at one of these positions.
6. We need to have the player at pos23 at some point, and later at pos41.
7. Finally, the main goal is to move the stone to pos11.

Let's think about this step by step:

1. We start with the stone at pos43 and the player at pos55.
2. Constraint 3 is already satisfied, but we need to either move the stone to pos45 or have pos42 not clear.
3. To satisfy constraint 1, we need to push the stone to pos23. This means pushing it from pos43 to pos33, and then to pos23.
4. To push the stone, we need to position the player appropriately. To push from pos43 to pos33, the player needs to be at pos53 and push left. After that, to push from pos33 to pos23, the player needs to be at pos43 and push left.
5. Constraint 4 can be satisfied by having the player at pos34 at some point. This is also part of constraint 1 after the stone is at pos23.
6. After the stone is at pos23, we can push it further to pos13 and eventually to pos11 (the goal).
7. Constraint 2 requires the player to be at pos13 at some point, and then at pos55 later. This fits with our plan since we need to push the stone to pos13.
8. Constraint 5 requires the player to be at pos23 at some point, and then at pos41 later. This also fits with our plan since we need to push the stone to pos23.

So our high-level plan could be:
1. Move the player to pos53 to push the stone from pos43 to pos33.
2. Move the player to pos43 to push the stone from pos33 to pos23.
3. Move to pos34 to satisfy constraint 1 after the stone is at pos23.
4. Move to pos23 and then push the stone to pos13.
5. Move to pos13 to satisfy constraint 2.
6. Push the stone from pos13 to pos12, and eventually to pos11 (the goal).
7. Move to pos41 to satisfy constraint 5 after the player is at pos23.
8. Move to pos55 to satisfy constraint 2 after the player is at pos13.

Let's start detailing the actions:

First, we need to move the player from pos55 to pos53:
move player1 pos55 pos54 dirup
move player1 pos54 pos53 dirup

Next, we push the stone from pos43 to pos33:
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos53 pos43 pos33 dirleft

We need to move the player to pos43:
move player1 pos43 pos42 dirleft
move player1 pos42 pos32 dirleft
move player1 pos32 pos33 dirdown
move player1 pos33 pos43 dirright

Now we push the stone from pos33 to pos23:
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos33 pos23 dirleft

To satisfy constraint 1, we need to have the player at pos34 after the stone is at pos23:
move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown

Now we need to push the stone from pos23 to pos13:
move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup
move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos13 dirleft

To satisfy constraint 2, we need to have the player at pos13:
move player1 pos13 pos13 dirleft (this is weird, but we're just trying to "be at pos13")

Now we need to push the stone from pos13 to pos12:
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos12 dirup

And finally, from pos12 to pos11:
pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos12 pos11 dirup

Wait, actually, I think there's an issue with the plan above. Let me reconsider:

1. The "move" action changes the position of the player.
2. The "pushtogoal" and "pushtonongoal" actions move the stone and also move the player to where the stone was.

So let's be more precise:

Starting state:
- player1 at pos55
- stone1 at pos43

1. Move player1 to pos53:
   move player1 pos55 pos54 dirup
   move player1 pos54 pos53 dirup

2. Push stone1 from pos43 to pos33:
   pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos53 pos43 pos33 dirleft
   Now player1 is at pos43 and stone1 is at pos33.

3. Push stone1 from pos33 to pos23:
   pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos33 pos23 dirleft
   Now player1 is at pos33 and stone1 is at pos23. Constraint 1 is partially satisfied.

4. Move player1 to pos34 (to fully satisfy constraint 1):
   move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown
   Constraint 1 is now fully satisfied. Constraint 4 is also satisfied (pos34 is not clear).

5. Move player1 to pos23 (to satisfy constraint 5 partially):
   move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup
   move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft
   Constraint 5 is partially satisfied.

6. Push stone1 from pos23 to pos13:
   pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos13 dirleft
   Now player1 is at pos23 and stone1 is at pos13. Constraint 2 is partially satisfied.

7. Move player1 to pos13:
   move player1 pos23 pos13 dirleft
   Constraint 2 is fully satisfied.

8. Push stone1 from pos13 to pos12:
   pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos12 dirup
   Now player1 is at pos13 and stone1 is at pos12.

9. Push stone1 from pos12 to pos11:
   pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos12 pos11 dirup
   Now player1 is at pos12 and stone1 is at pos11. The main goal is achieved.

10. Move player1 to pos41 (to fully satisfy constraint 5):
    move player1 pos12 pos22 dirright
    move player1 pos22 pos32 dirright
    move player1 pos32 pos42 dirright
    move player1 pos42 pos41 dirup
    Constraint 5 is now fully satisfied.

11. Move player1 to pos55 (to fully satisfy constraint 2):
    move player1 pos41 pos42 dirdown
    move player1 pos42 pos43 dirdown
    move player1 pos43 pos44 dirdown
    move player1 pos44 pos45 dirdown
    move player1 pos45 pos55 dirright
    Constraint 2 is now fully satisfied.

But I'm still missing constraint 3. After the stone is at pos43, we need to have either the stone at pos45 or pos42 not clear. Let's revise the plan:

Starting state:
- player1 at pos55
- stone1 at pos43
Constraint 3 is partially satisfied (stone1 is at pos43).

1. First, we'll move player1 to pos42 to satisfy the second part of constraint 3:
   move player1 pos55 pos45 dirleft
   move player1 pos45 pos44 dirup
   move player1 pos44 pos43 dirup
   At this point, player1 is at pos43 and stone1 is also at pos43, which doesn't make sense given the initial state. Let's go back and reconsider...

Actually, I am getting confused by the constraint 3. Let's look at it again:

"If expression 'stone1 is at location pos43' holds in some state s, then expression 'At least one of the following conditions is true: "Location pos42 is not clear", "stone1 is at location pos45"' must hold at s or at some state after s"

This constraint is satisfied in the initial state (stone1 is at pos43). But then the constraint says we need to either have pos42 not clear or stone1 at pos45. Let's assume we need to move the stone to pos45 to start with.

Let's revise the plan:

Starting state:
- player1 at pos55
- stone1 at pos43

1. Move player1 to push stone1 to pos45:
   move player1 pos55 pos54 dirup
   move player1 pos54 pos44 dirleft
   pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos43 pos45 dirdown
   Now player1 is at pos43 and stone1 is at pos45. Constraint 3 is fully satisfied.

2. Move player1 to push stone1 to pos35:
   move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft
   move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown
   move player1 pos34 pos35 dirdown
   pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos35 pos45 pos35 dirleft
   Now player1 is at pos45 and stone1 is at pos35. Constraint 4 is satisfied (pos34 is not clear).

3. Move player1 to push stone1 to pos25:
   move player1 pos45 pos35 dirleft
   pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos35 pos25 dirleft
   Now player1 is at pos35 and stone1 is at pos25.

4. Move player1 to push stone1 to pos24:
   move player1 pos35 pos25 dirleft
   pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos25 pos24 dirup
   Now player1 is at pos25 and stone1 is at pos24.

5. Move player1 to push stone1 to pos23:
   move player1 pos25 pos24 dirup
   pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos23 dirleft
   Now player1 is at pos24 and stone1 is at pos23. Constraint 1 is partially satisfied.

6. Move player1 to pos34 (to fully satisfy constraint 1):
   move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright
   Constraint 1 is now fully satisfied.

7. Move player1 to pos23 (to satisfy constraint 5 partially):
   move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup
   move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft
   Constraint 5 is partially satisfied.

8. Push stone1 from pos23 to pos13:
   pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos13 dirleft
   Now player1 is at pos23 and stone1 is at pos13.

9. Move player1 to pos13 (to satisfy constraint 2 partially):
   move player1 pos23 pos13 dirleft
   Constraint 2 is now partially satisfied.

10. Push stone1 from pos13 to pos12:
    pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos12 dirup
    Now player1 is at pos13 and stone1 is at pos12.

11. Push stone1 from pos12 to pos11:
    pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos12 pos11 dirup
    Now player1 is at pos12 and stone1 is at pos11. The main goal is achieved.

12. Move player1 to pos41 (to fully satisfy constraint 5):
    move player1 pos12 pos22 dirright
    move player1 pos22 pos32 dirright
    move player1 pos32 pos42 dirright
    move player1 pos42 pos41 dirup
    Constraint 5 is now fully satisfied.

13. Move player1 to pos55 (to fully satisfy constraint 2):
    move player1 pos41 pos42 dirdown
    move player1 pos42 pos43 dirdown
    move player1 pos43 pos44 dirdown
    move player1 pos44 pos45 dirdown
    move player1 pos45 pos55 dirright
    Constraint 2 is now fully satisfied.

Ok, this plan looks better:

```
move player1 pos55 pos54 dirup
move player1 pos54 pos44 dirleft
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos43 pos45 dirdown
move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft
move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown
move player1 pos34 pos35 dirdown
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos35 pos45 pos35 dirleft
move player1 pos45 pos35 dirleft
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos35 pos25 dirleft
move player1 pos35 pos25 dirleft
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos25 pos24 dirup
move player1 pos25 pos24 dirup
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos23 dirleft
move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright
move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup
move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos13 dirleft
move player1 pos23 pos13 dirleft
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos12 dirup
pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos12 pos11 dirup
move player1 pos12 pos22 dirright
move player1 pos22 pos32 dirright
move player1 pos32 pos42 dirright
move player1 pos42 pos41 dirup
move player1 pos41 pos42 dirdown
move player1 pos42 pos43 dirdown
move player1 pos43 pos44 dirdown
move player1 pos44 pos45 dirdown
move player1 pos45 pos55 dirright
```

Let me double-check the action specifications:

"pushtonongoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": Make agent p, situated at location l_p, push stone s from location l_from to non-goal location l_to, following direction d.

It looks like my actions for pushing the stone are incorrect. The parameters should be:
1. The agent (player1)
2. The stone (stone1)
3. The current location of the agent
4. The current location of the stone
5. The future location of the stone
6. The direction

Let me correct my plan:

At the start:
- player1 is at pos55
- stone1 is at pos43

1. Move player1 to push stone1 to pos44:
   move player1 pos55 pos54 dirup
   move player1 pos54 pos53 dirup
   pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos53 pos43 pos44 dirdown
   Now player1 is at pos43 and stone1 is at pos44.

2. Push stone1 to pos45:
   pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos44 pos45 dirdown
   Now player1 is at pos44 and stone1 is at pos45. Constraint 3 is fully satisfied.

3. Move player1 to push stone1 to pos35:
   move player1 pos44 pos34 dirleft
   move player1 pos34 pos35 dirdown
   pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos35 pos45 pos35 dirleft
   Now player1 is at pos45 and stone1 is at pos35. Constraint 4 is satisfied (pos34 has been not clear).

4. Move player1 to push stone1 to pos25:
   move player1 pos45 pos35 dirleft
   pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos35 pos35 pos25 dirleft
   This doesn't make sense because the stone is already at pos35...

Let me re-read the action descriptions:

"pushtonongoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": You may only perform this action if (i) agent p is at location l_p, (ii) stone s is at location l_from, (iii) location l_to is clear, (iv) you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d, (v) you can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d, and (vi) location l_to is not a goal location.

So if the agent is at pos35 and the stone is at pos45, and we want to push it to pos35, we'd use:
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos35 pos45 pos35 dirleft

But this is weird because it's pushing the stone to the agent's position. Let me reconsider.

The action specification says:
"pushtonongoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": You may only perform this action if (i) agent p is at location l_p, (ii) stone s is at location l_from, (iii) location l_to is clear, (iv) you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d, (v) you can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d, and (vi) location l_to is not a goal location.

So, if the agent is at pos35 and the stone is at pos45, and we want to push it to pos35, we'd be saying that the agent can get from pos35 to pos45 following the direction "dirleft", which doesn't make sense. The direction should be "dirright".

Let me reset:

At the start:
- player1 is at pos55
- stone1 is at pos43

1. Move player1 to position to push stone1:
   move player1 pos55 pos54 dirup
   move player1 pos54 pos53 dirup
   Now player1 is at pos53.

2. Push stone1 from pos43 to pos44:
   pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos53 pos43 pos44 dirdown
   Now player1 is at pos43 and stone1 is at pos44.

Actually, the push actions seem more complicated than I thought. Let's double-check the definition:

"pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": You may only perform this action if (i) agent p is at location l_p, (ii) stone s is at location l_from, (iii) location l_to is clear, (iv) you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d, (v) you can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d, and (vi) location l_to is a goal location.

"pushtonongoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": You may only perform this action if (i) agent p is at location l_p, (ii) stone s is at location l_from, (iii) location l_to is clear, (iv) you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d, (v) you can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d, and (vi) location l_to is not a goal location.

The key part is understanding the direction. If the agent is at location l_p and the stone is at location l_from, the agent needs to be able to move from l_p to l_from in the direction d. Then, the stone is pushed from l_from to l_to in the same direction d.

So if we're looking at the grid:

```
pos11 pos12 pos13 pos14 pos15
pos21 pos22 pos23 pos24 pos25
pos31 pos32 pos33 pos34 pos35
pos41 pos42 pos43 pos44 pos45
pos51 pos52 pos53 pos54 pos55
```

And if the agent is at pos53 and the stone is at pos43, the agent needs to be able to move from pos53 to pos43 in a certain direction. That direction would be "dirup", because moving up from pos53 gets us to pos43. And if we push the stone in the same direction, from pos43, it would go to pos33.

So, to push the stone from pos43 to pos33 with the agent at pos53, the action would be:
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos53 pos43 pos33 dirup

Let me revise the plan:

At the start:
- player1 is at pos55
- stone1 is at pos43

1. Move player1 to position to push stone1:
   move player1 pos55 pos54 dirup
   move player1 pos54 pos53 dirup
   Now player1 is at pos53.

2. Push stone1 from pos43 to pos33:
   pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos53 pos43 pos33 dirup
   Now player1 is at pos43 and stone1 is at pos33.

3. Move player1 to position to push stone1:
   move player1 pos43 pos42 dirup
   move player1 pos42 pos32 dirup
   move player1 pos32 pos33 dirright
   move player1 pos33 pos32 dirleft
   Now player1 is at pos32.

4. Push stone1 from pos33 to pos23:
   pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos33 pos23 dirup
   Now player1 is at pos33 and stone1 is at pos23. Constraint 1 is partially satisfied.

5. Move player1 to pos34 (to fully satisfy constraint 1):
   move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown
   Constraint 1 is now fully satisfied. Constraint 4 is also satisfied (pos34 is not clear).

6. Move player1 to pos23 (to satisfy constraint 5 partially):
   move player1 pos34 pos24 dirup
   move player1 pos24 pos23 dirleft
   Constraint 5 is partially satisfied.

7. Push stone1 from pos23 to pos13:
   pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos23 pos13 dirup
   This doesn't make sense. The agent is at the same position as the stone (pos23). I need to reconsider the pushing mechanism...

Wait, let me look at the "effects" of the pushtonongoal action.

"pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": After performing this action, (i) agent p is no longer at location l_p, (ii) stone s is no longer at location l_from, (iii) location l_to is no longer clear, (iv) agent p is at location l_from, (v) stone s is at location l_to, (vi) location l_p is clear, and (vi) stone s is at a goal state.

"pushtonongoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": After performing this action, (i) agent p is no longer at location l_p, (ii) stone s is no longer at location l_from, (iii) location l_to is no longer clear, (iv) agent p is at location l_from, (v) stone s is at location l_to, (vi) location l_p is clear, and (vi) stone s is at a non goal state.

Let's clarify by understanding this: After pushing the stone, the agent moves to the stone's original position, and the stone moves to its new position.

For the pushing to work, the agent needs to be adjacent to the stone in a way that the pushing direction makes sense. If the agent is at pos32 and the stone is at pos33, the agent can't push the stone up (dirup). To push the stone up, the agent would need to be at pos34.

Let me redo this:

At the start:
- player1 is at pos55
- stone1 is at pos43

1. Move player1 to position to push stone1:
   move player1 pos55 pos54 dirup
   move player1 pos54 pos53 dirup
   Now player1 is at pos53.

2. Push stone1 from pos43 to pos33:
   pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos53 pos43 pos33 dirleft
   Now player1 is at pos43 and stone1 is at pos33.

3. Move player1 to position to push stone1:
   move player1 pos43 pos34 dirright
   move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup
   move player1 pos33 pos32 dirleft
   Now player1 is at pos32.

4. Push stone1 from pos33 to pos23:
   pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos33 pos23 dirup
   Now player1 is at pos33 and stone1 is at pos23. Constraint 1 is partially satisfied.

Actually, I'm getting confused about the directions.

Let's refer to the grid again:
```
pos11 pos12 pos13 pos14 pos15
pos21 pos22 pos23 pos24 pos25
pos31 pos32 pos33 pos34 pos35
pos41 pos42 pos43 pos44 pos45
pos51 pos52 pos53 pos54 pos55
```
From the actions descriptions:
"You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright" - This means moving from pos11 to pos21 is considered moving to the right.
"You may move from location pos11 to location pos12 following direction dirdown" - This means moving from pos11 to pos12 is considered moving down.

So the grid is:
```
pos11 pos12 pos13 pos14 pos15 (top row)
pos21 pos22 pos23 pos24 pos25
pos31 pos32 pos33 pos34 pos35
pos41 pos42 pos43 pos44 pos45
pos51 pos52 pos53 pos54 pos55 (bottom row)
```

And the directions are:
- dirleft: moves left (e.g., from pos21 to pos11)
- dirright: moves right (e.g., from pos11 to pos21)
- dirup: moves up (e.g., from pos12 to pos11)
- dirdown: moves down (e.g., from pos11 to pos12)

Ok, so if I'm at pos53 and the stone is at pos43, to push the stone from pos43 to pos33, the action would be:
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos53 pos43 pos33 dirleft

But actually if we read the problem statement for the `pushtonongoal` action:

"pushtonongoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": You may only perform this action if (i) agent p is at location l_p, (ii) stone s is at location l_from, (iii) location l_to is clear, (iv) you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d, (v) you can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d, and (vi) location l_to is not a goal location.

Looking at a concrete map, if agent p is at pos53, stone s is at pos43, and we want to push the stone to pos33, we need:
- agent p (player1) is at location l_p (pos53)
- stone s (stone1) is at location l_from (pos43)
- location l_to (pos33) is clear
- you can get from location l_p (pos53) to location l_from (pos43) following direction d
- you can get from location l_from (pos43) to location l_to (pos33) following direction d

If d is "dirleft", we can't get from pos53 to pos43 following that direction. We'd need to go up, not left.

The action should be:
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos53 pos43 pos33 dirup

Ok so it would actually be "dirup" because from pos53 to pos43 we're going up.

Let me revise the plan:

At the start:
- player1 is at pos55
- stone1 is at pos43

1. Move player1 to position to push stone1:
   move player1 pos55 pos54 dirup
   move player1 pos54 pos53 dirup
   Now player1 is at pos53.

2. Push stone1 from pos43 to pos33:
   pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos53 pos43 pos33 dirup
   Now player1 is at pos43 and stone1 is at pos33.

3. Let's push the stone to pos23. We need to go up from pos33, which means the agent should be at pos43:
   pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos33 pos23 dirup
   Now player1 is at pos33 and stone1 is at pos23. Constraint 1 is partially satisfied.

4. Move player1 to pos34 (to fully satisfy constraint 1):
   move player1 pos33 pos34 dirright
   Constraint 1 is now fully satisfied. Constraint 4 is also satisfied (pos34 is not clear).

Let's make sure we're satisfying all the constraints. The constraints are:

1. stone1 is at pos23 at some point, and then player1 is at pos34 at that time or later. We've already satisfied this.
2. player1 is at pos13 at some point, and then player1 is at pos55 at that time or later.
3. stone1 is at pos43 at some point (this is already satisfied in the initial state), and then either pos42 is not clear or stone1 is at pos45. 
4. Either pos34 or pos31 is not clear at some point. We've already satisfied this.
5. player1 is at pos23 at some point, and then player1 is at pos41 at that time or later.

Let's see where we are:
- player1 is at pos34
- stone1 is at pos23
- Constraints 1, 3, and 4 are satisfied.

We still need to satisfy constraints 2 and 5. Let's continue:

5. Move player1 to pos23 (to partially satisfy constraint 5):
   move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft
   move player1 pos24 pos23 dirleft
   Constraint 5 is partially satisfied.

6. Push stone1 from pos23 to pos13:
   pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos23 pos13 dirup
   This is not right, because if player1 is at pos23, it can't push the stone from pos23 to pos13 if the stone is also at pos23.

Let's recall the action definition:
"pushtonongoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": You may only perform this action if (i) agent p is at location l_p, (ii) stone s is at location l_from, (iii) location l_to is clear, (iv) you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d, (v) you can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d, and (vi) location l_to is not a goal location.

So, if player1 is at pos23 and stone1 is also at pos23, we need to make sure that by moving in a direction d, the stone would go to pos13.

Actually, maybe it's easier to get to a new position to push the stone:

5. Move player1 to pos24 to prepare to push the stone from pos23 to pos13:
   move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft
   Now player1 is at pos24.

6. Push stone1 from pos23 to pos13:
   pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos23 pos13 dirleft
   Now player1 is at pos23 and stone1 is at pos13. Constraint 5 is partially satisfied.

7. Move player1 to pos13 (to partially satisfy constraint 2):
   move player1 pos23 pos13 dirleft
   Constraint 2 is partially satisfied.

8. Push stone1 from pos13 to pos12:
   pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos13 pos12 dirup
   This is not right. And again, I'm double-counting the agent's position as the stone's position.

Let's also note:
Constraint 5 requires player1 to be at pos23, which is already satisfied. Then it requires player1 to later be at pos41. So we need to ensure player1 visits pos41 after visiting pos23.

Constraint 2 requires player1 to be at pos13, and then later at pos55. So after player1 visits pos13, it needs to visit pos55.

Let me adjust:

5. Move player1 to pos24 (to prepare for pushing):
   move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft
   Now player1 is at pos24.

6. Push stone1 from pos23 to pos13:
   pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos23 pos13 dirleft
   Now player1 is at pos23 (Constraint 5 partially satisfied) and stone1 is at pos13.

7. Move player1 to pos13 (to partially satisfy constraint 2):
   move player1 pos23 pos13 dirleft
   Constraint 2 is partially satisfied.

8. Push stone1 from pos13 to pos12:
   We need to find a position to be at to push stone1 from pos13 to pos12. We need to be able to move to pos13 in a direction that, if continued, would lead to pos12.
   From the grid, we can see that to push stone1 from pos13 to pos12, we'd need to be at pos14 and push it up.
   move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown
   pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos14 pos13 pos12 dirup
   Now player1 is at pos13 and stone1 is at pos12.

9. Push stone1 from pos12 to pos11:
   Again, we need to find a position to be at to push stone1 from pos12 to pos11. We need to be able to move to pos12 in a direction that, if continued, would lead to pos11.
   From the grid, we can see that to push stone1 from pos12 to pos11, we'd need to be at pos13 and push it up.
   move player1 pos13 pos13 dirright (already at pos13)
   pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos12 pos11 dirleft
   Now player1 is at pos12 and stone1 is at pos11. The main goal is achieved.

Now we need to finish satisfying constraints 2 and 5:

10. Move player1 to pos41 (to fully satisfy constraint 5):
    move player1 pos12 pos22 dirright
    move player1 pos22 pos32 dirright
    move player1 pos32 pos42 dirright
    move player1 pos42 pos41 dirleft
    Constraint 5 is now fully satisfied.

11. Move player1 to pos55 (to fully satisfy constraint 2):
    move player1 pos41 pos51 dirright
    move player1 pos51 pos52 dirdown
    move player1 pos52 pos53 dirdown
    move player1 pos53 pos54 dirdown
    move player1 pos54 pos55 dirdown
    Constraint 2 is now fully satisfied.

Let's check our complete plan:

```
move player1 pos55 pos54 dirup
move player1 pos54 pos53 dirup
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos53 pos43 pos33 dirup
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos33 pos23 dirup
move player1 pos33 pos34 dirright
move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos23 pos13 dirleft
move player1 pos23 pos13 dirleft
move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos14 pos13 pos12 dirup
pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos12 pos11 dirleft
move player1 pos12 pos22 dirright
move player1 pos22 pos32 dirright
move player1 pos32 pos42 dirright
move player1 pos42 pos41 dirleft
move player1 pos41 pos51 dirright
move player1 pos51 pos52 dirdown
move player1 pos52 pos53 dirdown
move player1 pos53 pos54 dirdown
move player1 pos54 pos55 dirdown
```

OK let me double-check the actions in the plan:

1. `move player1 pos55 pos54 dirup` - Move player1 from pos55 to pos54 by going up (upwards on the grid). This is fine.
2. `move player1 pos54 pos53 dirup` - Move player1 from pos54 to pos53 by going up. This is fine.
3. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos53 pos43 pos33 dirup` - From pos53, push stone1 from pos43 to pos33 by going up. This is fine.
4. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos33 pos23 dirup` - From pos43, push stone1 from pos33 to pos23 by going up. This is fine.
5. `move player1 pos33 pos34 dirright` - Move player1 from pos33 to pos34 by going right. This is fine.
6. `move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft` - Move player1 from pos34 to pos24 by going left. 

I think there might be an issue with this action. Looking at the grid, pos24 is to the left and up from pos34, so we'd need to move up, not left.

Actually, let me check the movement possibilities from the problem description:
"You may move from location pos34 to location pos24 following direction dirleft" - This indicates that moving from pos34 to pos24 is considered a "left" movement. It seems their grid might be slightly different from the typical Cartesian grid.

Continuing:
7. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos23 pos13 dirleft` - From pos24, push stone1 from pos23 to pos13 by going left. This seems fine. And actually, in this perspective, pos24 is to the left of pos34, because "left" means the x-coordinate decreases.
8. `move player1 pos23 pos13 dirleft` - Move player1 from pos23 to pos13 by going left. This is fine.
9. `move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown` - Move player1 from pos13 to pos14 by going down. This is fine.
10. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos14 pos13 pos12 dirup` - From pos14, push stone1 from pos13 to pos12 by going up. This seems right.
11. `pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos12 pos11 dirleft` - From pos13, push stone1 from pos12 to the goal location pos11 by going left. Wait, this doesn't seem right.

If player1 is at pos13 and stone1 is at pos12, you can't push the stone to the left (towards pos11) from that position. You'd need to be at a position where moving towards pos12 would make sense to push it to pos11. Maybe we should be at pos13 and push up?

Let me review the grid again:
```
pos11 pos12 pos13 pos14 pos15
pos21 pos22 pos23 pos24 pos25
pos31 pos32 pos33 pos34 pos35
pos41 pos42 pos43 pos44 pos45
pos51 pos52 pos53 pos54 pos55
```

We'd need to be at pos13 and push stone1 (at pos12) left to move it to pos11.

"pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d" means the agent p is at location l_p, the stone s is at location l_from, and the stone is pushed to location l_to following direction d.

So, we're at pos13, stone1 is at pos12, and we want to push it to pos11. But the preconditions say (iv) you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d, and (v) you can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d.

Can we get from pos13 to pos12 by going left? No, we'd need to go up.
Can we get from pos13 to pos12 by going up? No, we'd need to go left.

You know what, looking at the grid, the correct representation is likely:
```
pos11 pos12 pos13 pos14 pos15
pos21 pos22 pos23 pos24 pos25
pos31 pos32 pos33 pos34 pos35
pos41 pos42 pos43 pos44 pos45
pos51 pos52 pos53 pos54 pos55
```

Where the first digit represents the column (x-coordinate), and the second digit represents the row (y-coordinate).

And again looking at the movement possibilities:
"You may move from location pos34 to location pos24 following direction dirleft" - This indicates that pos24 is to the left of pos34.

So, the grid is more like:
```
pos11 pos21 pos31 pos41 pos51
pos12 pos22 pos32 pos42 pos52
pos13 pos23 pos33 pos43 pos53
pos14 pos24 pos34 pos44 pos54
pos15 pos25 pos35 pos45 pos55
```

This means:
- dirleft: from a position with a higher first digit to one with a lower first digit
- dirright: from a position with a lower first digit to one with a higher first digit
- dirup: from a position with a higher second digit to one with a lower second digit
- dirdown: from a position with a lower second digit to one with a higher second digit

Let me recheck our steps:

1. `move player1 pos55 pos54 dirup` - Move player1 from pos55 to pos54 by going up.
2. `move player1 pos54 pos53 dirup` - Move player1 from pos54 to pos53 by going up.
3. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos53 pos43 pos33 dirup` - From pos53, push stone1 from pos43 to pos33 by going up (the stone moves from (4,3) to (3,3)). This is fine.
4. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos33 pos23 dirup` - From pos43, push stone1 from pos33 to pos23 by going up (the stone moves from (3,3) to (2,3)). This is fine.
5. `move player1 pos33 pos34 dirright` - Move player1 from pos33 to pos34 by going right (from (3,3) to (3,4)). This is fine.
6. `move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft` - Move player1 from pos34 to pos24 by going left (from (3,4) to (2,4)). This is fine.
7. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos23 pos13 dirup` - From pos24, push stone1 from pos23 to pos13 by going up. Wait, this doesn't seem right. The stone is at (2,3) and we want to push it to (1,3). We'd need to go left, not up.

Ah, I see the issue. Given the direction definitions I've established, pos13 is actually to the left of pos23, not upwards.

Revising:
7. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos23 pos13 dirleft` - From pos24, push stone1 from pos23 to pos13 by going left. The stone moves from (2,3) to (1,3). This is fine.
8. `move player1 pos23 pos13 dirleft` - Move player1 from pos23 to pos13 by going left (from (2,3) to (1,3)). This is fine. But wait, as a result of action 7, player1 is already at pos23, so we don't need to move. Or do we?

OK at the end of step 7, player1 is at pos23 but stone1 is at pos13.
8. `move player1 pos23 pos13 dirleft` - Move player1 from pos23 to pos13 by going left. This is fine.
9. `move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown` - Move player1 from pos13 to pos14 by going down (from (1,3) to (1,4)). This is fine.
10. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos14 pos13 pos12 dirup` - From pos14, push stone1 from pos13 to pos12 by going up (the stone moves from (1,3) to (1,2)). This is fine.
11. `pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos12 pos11 dirup` - From pos13, push stone1 from pos12 to the goal location pos11 by going up. (the stone moves from (1,2) to (1,1)). This is fine.

Actually I think all the actions are fine. Let me double-check the constraint satisfaction:

1. stone1 is at pos23 at some point, and then player1 is at pos34 at that time or later. After step 4, stone1 is at pos23 and player1 is at pos33. In step 5, player1 moves to pos34. Constraint is satisfied.
2. player1 is at pos13 at some point, and then player1 is at pos55 at that time or later. After step 8, player1 is at pos13. Player1 needs to visit pos55 later, which we'll have to ensure at the end of the plan.
3. stone1 is at pos43 at some point, and then either pos42 is not clear or stone1 is at pos45. In the initial state, stone1 is at pos43. We need to ensure either pos42 is not clear or stone1 is at pos45 at some point after. Hmm, it doesn't seem like we're satisfying this constraint.
4. Either pos34 or pos31 is not clear at some point. After step 5, player1 is at pos34, so pos34 is not clear. Constraint is satisfied.
5. player1 is at pos23 at some point, and then player1 is at pos41 at that time or later. After step 7, player1 is at pos23. Player1 needs to visit pos41 later, which we'll have to ensure at the end of the plan.

I missed constraint 3. Let me adjust:

After step 3, player1 is at pos43 and stone1 is at pos33. At this point, we could move player1 to pos42 to make it not clear, which would satisfy constraint 3.

Updated plan:

1. `move player1 pos55 pos54 dirup` - Move player1 from pos55 to pos54 by going up.
2. `move player1 pos54 pos53 dirup` - Move player1 from pos54 to pos53 by going up.
3. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos53 pos43 pos33 dirleft` - From pos53, push stone1 from pos43 to pos33 by going left. The stone moves from (4,3) to (3,3). This is fine.
4. `move player1 pos43 pos42 dirup` - Move player1 from pos43 to pos42 by going up.  This satisfies constraint 3.
5. `move player1 pos42 pos43 dirdown` - Move player1 back to pos43 to continue with our plan.
6. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos33 pos23 dirleft` - From pos43, push stone1 from pos33 to pos23 by going left. The stone moves from (3,3) to (2,3). This is fine.
7. `move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown` - Move player1 from pos33 to pos34 by going down (from (3,3) to (3,4)). This is fine. And satisfies constraint 1.
8. `move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft` - Move player1 from pos34 to pos24 by going left (from (3,4) to (2,4)). This is fine.
9. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos23 pos13 dirleft` - From pos24, push stone1 from pos23 to pos13 by going left. The stone moves from (2,3) to (1,3). This is fine. Player1 is now at pos23, satisfying constraint 5 partially.
10. `move player1 pos23 pos13 dirleft` - Move player1 from pos23 to pos13 by going left. This is fine. And satisfies constraint 2 partially.
11. `move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown` - Move player1 from pos13 to pos14 by going down (from (1,3) to (1,4)). This is fine.
12. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos14 pos13 pos12 dirup` - From pos14, push stone1 from pos13 to pos12 by going up (the stone moves from (1,3) to (1,2)). This is fine.
13. `pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos12 pos11 dirup` - From pos13, push stone1 from pos12 to the goal location pos11 by going up. (the stone moves from (1,2) to (1,1)). This is fine.

Now we need to ensure player1 visits pos41 to satisfy constraint 5 fully, and pos55 to satisfy constraint 2 fully:

14. `move player1 pos12 pos22 dirright` - Move player1 from pos12 to pos22 by going right.
15. `move player1 pos22 pos32 dirright` - Move player1 from pos22 to pos32 by going right.
16. `move player1 pos32 pos42 dirright` - Move player1 from pos32 to pos42 by going right.
17. `move player1 pos42 pos41 dirup` - Move player1 from pos42 to pos41 by going up. This satisfies constraint 5 fully.
18. `move player1 pos41 pos51 dirright` - Move player1 from pos41 to pos51 by going right.
19. `move player1 pos51 pos52 dirdown` - Move player1 from pos51 to pos52 by going down.
20. `move player1 pos52 pos53 dirdown` - Move player1 from pos52 to pos53 by going down.
21. `move player1 pos53 pos54 dirdown` - Move player1 from pos53 to pos54 by going down.
22. `move player1 pos54 pos55 dirdown` - Move player1 from pos54 to pos55 by going down. This satisfies constraint 2 fully.

Actually, let me double-check the directions with the initial movement description:

"You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright" - This means (1,1) to (2,1) is right.
"You may move from location pos11 to location pos12 following direction dirdown" - This means (1,1) to (1,2) is down.

OK so my representation of the grid is correct:
```
pos11 pos21 pos31 pos41 pos51
pos12 pos22 pos32 pos42 pos52
pos13 pos23 pos33 pos43 pos53
pos14 pos24 pos34 pos44 pos54
pos15 pos25 pos35 pos45 pos55
```

Let me double-check our movements again:

1. `move player1 pos55 pos54 dirup` - Move player1 from pos55 to pos54 by going up.
2. `move player1 pos54 pos53 dirup` - Move player1 from pos54 to pos53 by going up.
3. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos53 pos43 pos33 dirleft` - From pos53, push stone1 from pos43 to pos33 by going left. The stone moves from (4,3) to (3,3).

This doesn't seem right. If player1 is at (5,3) and stone1 is at (4,3), we'd need to move left to push the stone, not up. And the stone would move from (4,3) to (3,3) by going left, not up.

Upon further reflection, I think I might be over-complicating this. Let's revert to thinking about dirright as moving right, dirleft as moving left, dirup as moving up, and dirdown as moving down.

So, the grid is:
```
pos11 pos12 pos13 pos14 pos15
pos21 pos22 pos23 pos24 pos25
pos31 pos32 pos33 pos34 pos35
pos41 pos42 pos43 pos44 pos45
pos51 pos52 pos53 pos54 pos55
```

I see, here's the confusion:
"You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright" - This means moving from (1,1) to (2,1) is moving right.
"You may move from location pos11 to location pos12 following direction dirdown" - This means moving from (1,1) to (1,2) is moving down.

So the first digit refers to the row, and the second digit to the column.

So the grid should be:
```
pos11 pos12 pos13 pos14 pos15
pos21 pos22 pos23 pos24 pos25
pos31 pos32 pos33 pos34 pos35
pos41 pos42 pos43 pos44 pos45
pos51 pos52 pos53 pos54 pos55
```

Now, let's trace our movements:

1. `move player1 pos55 pos54 dirup` - Move player1 from (5,5) to (5,4) by going up. This is fine.
2. `move player1 pos54 pos53 dirup` - Move player1 from (5,4) to (5,3) by going up. This is fine.
3. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos53 pos43 pos33 dirleft` - From (5,3), push stone1 from (4,3) to (3,3) by going left. This is fine.

Wait, but to push the stone we'd need to be at (5,3) and move in a direction to reach (4,3). If we move left from (5,3), I'm not sure how to reach (4,3). It's not clear to me.

Let's revisit the problem description:

"pushtonongoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": You may only perform this action if (i) agent p is at location l_p, (ii) stone s is at location l_from, (iii) location l_to is clear, (iv) you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d, and (v) you can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d.

It seems the agent should be able to go to the stone by following direction d, and then the stone should move in the same direction. So if player1 is at (5,3) and the stone is at (4,3), we'd need to follow dirLeft to get from (5,3) to (4,3). And to push the stone from (4,3) to (3,3), it would need to go in the same dirLeft direction.

OK let me fix my plan:

1. `move player1 pos55 pos54 dirup` - Move player1 from (5,5) to (5,4) by going up.
2. `move player1 pos54 pos53 dirup` - Move player1 from (5,4) to (5,3) by going up.
3. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos53 pos43 pos33 dirleft` - From (5,3), push stone1 from (4,3) to (3,3) by going left. This is fine.

Alright, let me quickly review the grid again:

```
(1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (1,4) (1,5)
(2,1) (2,2) (2,3) (2,4) (2,5)
(3,1) (3,2) (3,3) (3,4) (3,5)
(4,1) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) (4,5)
(5,1) (5,2) (5,3) (5,4) (5,5)
```

The first digit represents the row, and the second digit represents the column.

Now, let's carefully trace our actions:

1. `move player1 pos55 pos54 dirup` - Move player1 from (5,5) to (5,4) by going up. This is fine.
2. `move player1 pos54 pos53 dirup` - Move player1 from (5,4) to (5,3) by going up. This is fine.
3. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos53 pos43 pos33 dirleft` - From (5,3), push stone1 from (4,3) to (3,3) by going left. This is fine. player1 is now at (4,3).
4. `move player1 pos43 pos42 dirup` - Move player1 from (4,3) to (4,2) by going up. This satisfies constraint 3. player1 is now at (4,2).
5. `move player1 pos42 pos43 dirdown` - Move player1 back to (4,3) to continue with our plan. player1 is now at (4,3).
6. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos33 pos23 dirleft` - From (4,3), push stone1 from (3,3) to (2,3) by going left. This is fine. player1 is now at (3,3).
7. `move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown` - Move player1 from (3,3) to (3,4) by going down. This is fine. And satisfies constraint 1. player1 is now at (3,4).
8. `move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft` - Move player1 from (3,4) to (2,4) by going left. This is fine. player1 is now at (2,4).
9. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos23 pos13 dirleft` - From (2,4), push stone1 from (2,3) to (1,3) by going left. This is fine. player1 is now at (2,3), satisfying constraint 5 partially. stone1 is now at (1,3).
10. `move player1 pos23 pos13 dirleft` - Move player1 from (2,3) to (1,3) by going left. player1 is now at (1,3). But stone1 is also at (1,3), which doesn't make sense. I'm getting confused again.

Actually, I think I was right the first time. In the problem description, pos11 refers to position (1,1), and so on. And now let's check the movement rules:

"You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright" - This means moving from (1,1) to (2,1) is moving right. So increasing the first coordinate means moving right.
"You may move from location pos11 to location pos12 following direction dirdown" - This means moving from (1,1) to (1,2) is moving down. So increasing the second coordinate means moving down.

So, the grid is:
```
(1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (4,1) (5,1)
(1,2) (2,2) (3,2) (4,2) (5,2)
(1,3) (2,3) (3,3) (4,3) (5,3)
(1,4) (2,4) (3,4) (4,4) (5,4)
(1,5) (2,5) (3,5) (4,5) (5,5)
```

OK given this grid, let me revise the plan:

1. Move player1 from (5,5) to (5,4) by going up.
   `move player1 pos55 pos54 dirup`
2. Move player1 from (5,4) to (5,3) by going up.
   `move player1 pos54 pos53 dirup`
3. Push stone1 from (4,3) to (3,3) by player1 going left from (5,3).
   `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos53 pos43 pos33 dirleft`
   After this, player1 is at (4,3) and stone1 is at (3,3).
4. Move player1 from (4,3) to (4,2) by going up. This satisfies constraint 3 (making position (4,2) not clear).
   `move player1 pos43 pos42 dirup`
5. Move player1 back to (4,3).
   `move player1 pos42 pos43 dirdown`
6. Push stone1 from (3,3) to (2,3) by player1 going left from (4,3).
   `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos33 pos23 dirleft`
   After this, player1 is at (3,3) and stone1 is at (2,3).
7. Move player1 from (3,3) to (3,4) by going down. This satisfies constraint 1.
   `move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown`
8. Move player1 from (3,4) to (2,4) by going left.
   `move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft`
9. Push stone1 from (2,3) to (1,3) by player1 going left from (2,4).
   `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos23 pos13 dirleft`
   After this, player1 is at (2,3) and stone1 is at (1,3).
10. Move player1 from (2,3) to (1,3) by going left. But stone1 is already at (1,3). So we can't perform this action.

Actually, pushtonongoal changes the location of both the player and the stone. Specifically, it moves the stone to a new position and moves the player to the stone's previous position.

So after step 9, we have:
- player1 at (2,3)
- stone1 at (1,3)

To satisfy constraint 2 partially, we need player1 at (1,3). But stone1 is already at (1,3). Let's think of another way to get player1 to (1,3).

OK let me try one more time with the right grid:

1. Move player1 from (5,5) to (5,4) by going up.
   `move player1 pos55 pos54 dirup`
2. Move player1 from (5,4) to (5,3) by going up.
   `move player1 pos54 pos53 dirup`
3. Push stone1 from (4,3) to (3,3) by player1 going left from (5,3).
   `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos53 pos43 pos33 dirleft`
   After this, player1 is at (4,3) and stone1 is at (3,3).
4. Move player1 from (4,3) to (4,2) by going up. This satisfies constraint 3 (making position (4,2) not clear).
   `move player1 pos43 pos42 dirup`
5. Move player1 back to (4,3).
   `move player1 pos42 pos43 dirdown`
6. Push stone1 from (3,3) to (2,3) by player1 going left from (4,3).
   `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos33 pos23 dirleft`
   After this, player1 is at (3,3) and stone1 is at (2,3).
7. Move player1 from (3,3) to (3,4) by going down. This satisfies constraint 1.
   `move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown`
8. Move player1 from (3,4) to (2,4) by going left.
   `move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft`
9. Push stone1 from (2,3) to (1,3) by player1 going left from (2,4).
   `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos23 pos13 dirleft`
   After this, player1 is at (2,3) and stone1 is at (1,3).

Now we need to ensure player1 visits (1,3) to satisfy constraint 2. Since stone1 is already at (1,3), we need to move stone1 first. Let's push it downward.

10. Move player1 from (2,3) to (2,4) by going down.
    `move player1 pos23 pos24 dirdown`
11. Push stone1 from (1,3) to (1,4) by player1 going left from (2,4).
    `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos13 pos14 dirleft`
    After this, player1 is at (1,3) and stone1 is at (1,4).
    And we satisfy constraint 2 partially.

Now we need to push stone1 from (1,4) to (1,2) to get it to the goal position.

12. Push stone1 from (1,4) to (1,3) by player1 going up from (1,3).
    Wait this doesn't work, because we'd need to be at (1,5) to push the stone from (1,4) to (1,3). Let me reconsider.

Hmm, I made an error. If player1 is at (2,4) and stone1 is at (1,3), and we push stone1 to (1,4), the player moves to (1,3) and the stone moves to (1,4). But that can't work, because from (2,4), we'd need to go left to get to (1,4), but (1,3) is in the way.

Let's try a different approach:

10. Move player1 from (2,3) to (1,3) by going left. But stone1 is already at (1,3), which is a problem.

Even more generally, I think if the agent is at position x and the stone is at position y, and the agent pushes the stone in direction d, then the agent moves to position y and the stone moves to position z, where z is the position one step in direction d from y. And since the final goal is to get the stone to (1,1), we need to move the player to a position from which it can push the stone to (1,1).

Wait, let me revisit the definition of pushtonongoal:

"pushtonongoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": You may only perform this action if (i) agent p is at location l_p, (ii) stone s is at location l_from, (iii) location l_to is clear, (iv) you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d, (v) you can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d, and (vi) location l_to is not a goal location.

If player1 is at (2,3) and stone1 is at (1,3), we'd need to move in a direction d such that we get from (2,3) to (1,3) by following d. This would be the 'left' direction. We'd also need to be able to get from (1,3) to some other position by following the same direction d. If d is 'left', we'd go from (1,3) to (0,3), which is off the grid. So this doesn't work.

Let's revisit our current positions:
- player1 is at (2,3)
- stone1 is at (1,3)

We need player1 to be at (1,3) to satisfy constraint 2. One way is to push the stone from (1,3) to another position, so player1 can occupy (1,3).

Let's see if we can push the stone up from (1,3) to (1,2):

10. Move player1 from (2,3) to (2,2) by going up.
    `move player1 pos23 pos22 dirup`
11. Push stone1 from (1,3) to (1,2) by player1 going left from (2,2).
    `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos13 pos12 dirleft`
    After this, player1 is at (1,3) and stone1 is at (1,2). We satisfy constraint 2 partially.

Now we can push stone1 from (1,2) to (1,1) (the goal position).

12. Push stone1 from (1,2) to (1,1) by player1 going up from (1,3).
    `pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos12 pos11 dirup`
    After this, player1 is at (1,2) and stone1 is at (1,1).

Now, we need player1 to visit (4,1) and (5,5) to satisfy the remaining constraints.

13. Move player1 from (1,2) to (2,2) by going right.
    `move player1 pos12 pos22 dirright`
14. Move player1 from (2,2) to (3,2) by going right.
    `move player1 pos22 pos32 dirright`
15. Move player1 from (3,2) to (4,2) by going right.
    `move player1 pos32 pos42 dirright`
16. Move player1 from (4,2) to (4,1) by going up. This satisfies constraint 5 fully.
    `move player1 pos42 pos41 dirup`
17. Move player1 from (4,1) to (5,1) by going right.
    `move player1 pos41 pos51 dirright`
18. Move player1 from (5,1) to (5,2) by going down.
    `move player1 pos51 pos52 dirdown`
19. Move player1 from (5,2) to (5,3) by going down.
    `move player1 pos52 pos53 dirdown`
20. Move player1 from (5,3) to (5,4) by going down.
    `move player1 pos53 pos54 dirdown`
21. Move player1 from (5,4) to (5,5) by going down. This satisfies constraint 2 fully.
    `move player1 pos54 pos55 dirdown`

So the final plan is:

```
move player1 pos55 pos54 dirup
move player1 pos54 pos53 dirup
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos53 pos43 pos33 dirleft
move player1 pos43 pos42 dirup
move player1 pos42 pos43 dirdown
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos33 pos23 dirleft
move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown
move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos23 pos13 dirleft
move player1 pos23 pos22 dirup
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos13 pos12 dirleft
pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos12 pos11 dirup
move player1 pos12 pos22 dirright
move player1 pos22 pos32 dirright
move player1 pos32 pos42 dirright
move player1 pos42 pos41 dirup
move player1 pos41 pos51 dirright
move player1 pos51 pos52 dirdown
move player1 pos52 pos53 dirdown
move player1 pos53 pos54 dirdown
move player1 pos54 pos55 dirdown
```

Let me double-check once more if this plan satisfies all constraints.

Constraint 1: stone1 should be at (2,3) at some point, and then player1 should be at (3,4) at that time or later.
After step 6, stone1 is at (2,3) and player1 is at (3,3). In step 7, player1 moves to (3,4). So this constraint is met.

Constraint 2: player1 should be at (1,3) at some point, and then player1 should be at (5,5) at that time or later.
After step 11, player1 is at (1,3). In step 21, player1 moves to (5,5). So this constraint is met.

Constraint 3: stone1 should be at (4,3) at some point (already satisfied in the initial state), and then either (4,2) should not be clear or stone1 should be at (4,5).
After step 4, player1 is at (4,2), making it not clear. So this constraint is met.

Constraint 4: Either (3,4) or (3,1) should not be clear at some point.
After step 7, player1 is at (3,4), making it not clear. So this constraint is met.

Constraint 5: player1 should be at (2,3) at some point, and then player1 should be at (4,1) at that time or later.
After step 9, player1 is at (2,3). In step 16, player1 moves to (4,1). So this constraint is met.

Yes, all constraints are satisfied.
