Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. So, the goal is to move stone1 to a goal location, which is pos11. The initial state has the player at pos55 and the stone at pos43. But there are a bunch of constraints to satisfy too.

First, let's note all the constraints. The first one says that stone1 must be at pos23 in at least one state. But then, once it's there, the player must be at pos34 either at that state or later. Also, the player must be at pos13 at some point, and after that, they must reach pos55. Additionally, stone1 must be at pos43 in some state (which it is initially, but maybe we need to revisit?), and if it's there, then either pos42 is not clear or stone1 is at pos45 afterward. There's another constraint that in some state, pos34 or pos31 isn't clear. The player also needs to be at pos23 at some point and then go to pos41 afterward.

Wait, the initial position of the stone is pos43. So the constraint about stone1 being at pos43 in some state is already satisfied in the initial state. But the problem is that the constraint says if stone1 is at pos43 in state s, then in s or after, either pos42 is not clear or stone1 is at pos45. So after moving the stone from pos43, we need to ensure that either pos42 is occupied (maybe by the player) or the stone ends up at pos45. Hmm.

Our main goal is to get the stone to a goal location. The only goal location mentioned is pos11. Wait, looking back: the original state says pos11 is a goal location. All others are non-goal. So the stone must end up at pos11.

But moving the stone from pos43 to pos11 seems quite a journey. Let's map out the grid. The grid is 5x5, with pos11 at the top-left and pos55 at the bottom-right. So pos43 is in row 4, column 3. The goal is pos11 (row1, column1).

The player starts at pos55. To move the stone from pos43 to pos11, the player needs to navigate to the stone, push it towards the goal. But there are constraints along the way.

First, we need to pass through pos23 with the stone. So the stone must be moved to pos23 at some point. Then, after that, the player must reach pos34. Let's see how that could happen.

Let's think of a path. From pos43, pushing the stone up (dirup) would take it to pos33. Then left to pos23? Wait, but pushing requires the player to be adjacent. So maybe the player moves to pos44, pushes the stone up to pos34, then to pos33, then left to pos23. Wait, but each push action moves the stone one step in a direction, with the player moving into the stone's original position.

Alternatively, the player could push the stone left from pos43 to pos42, then up to pos32, etc. But we need to reach pos23. Let's think about possible paths.

Another constraint is the player must be at pos13 at some point and then eventually reach pos55. Also, the player must be at pos23 and then go to pos41. So the plan needs to include these intermediate steps.

Let's outline possible steps:

1. Move the player from pos55 to pos45, then to pos44, then pos43. But initially, pos43 has the stone. Wait, the initial state says "Location pos43 is clear". Wait no, the original state says "stone1 is at location pos43" and "Location pos43 is clear". Wait, that can't be. Wait, the original state lists "Location pos43 is clear" but stone1 is at pos43. That's a contradiction. Wait, maybe there's a mistake here. Let me check the original state again.

Looking back: The original state includes "stone1 is at location pos43" and "Location pos43 is clear". That's conflicting. Because if a stone is at a location, that location shouldn't be clear. Unless "clear" here means that there's no agent there. Because the agent and stones are separate. So "clear" means that neither the agent nor a stone is present. Wait, the problem statement says "Each position on the grid may contain either the agent, a stone or be empty." So a location is clear if it's empty. But the original state says "stone1 is at location pos43" and "Location pos43 is clear". That must be a mistake. Wait, maybe the original state has a typo. Let me check again.

Original state:
"player1 is at location pos55"
"stone1 is at location pos43"
...
"Location pos43 is clear"

Wait, that's a problem. If stone1 is at pos43, then pos43 is not clear. But according to the initial state, pos43 is clear. That must be an error. But assuming that the problem is correctly stated, perhaps "clear" refers to the agent's presence. Wait, the problem's description says "Each position on the grid may contain either the agent, a stone or be empty." So a location can have the agent, a stone, or be empty. So "clear" probably means empty. So if a stone is at pos43, pos43 is not clear. Therefore, the original state seems to have conflicting statements. But the user provided this, so perhaps there's a misunderstanding. Alternatively, maybe "clear" refers to the agent's absence. For example, "Location pos43 is clear" means the agent isn't there, but the stone can be. Let's check the preconditions of actions.

Looking at the "move" action's preconditions: (ii) location l_to is clear. So if the agent wants to move to a location, it must be clear (i.e., no agent or stone there). But if a stone is present, the location isn't clear, so the agent can't move there. So in the initial state, pos43 has the stone, so it's not clear. But the original state says "Location pos43 is clear". This is a contradiction, which suggests that there's a mistake in the problem statement. Alternatively, perhaps "clear" refers only to the agent's presence, and stones don't block movement. But according to the problem statement, stones are in the grid, so they should block movement. Because otherwise, the agent could just move through stones. But the problem says that the move action requires l_to to be clear. So in the initial state, pos43 has a stone, so it's not clear. Therefore, the original state's "Location pos43 is clear" must be incorrect. But since this is given, perhaps it's a mistake. But I have to proceed with the given information.

Assuming that the initial state is as stated, even if conflicting. Maybe "clear" in the original state refers to the agent's absence, and stones are allowed. So the agent can move to a location with a stone if it's not blocked. Wait, no, because the move action's precondition requires l_to to be clear. So if a stone is at pos43, then pos43 is not clear. Therefore, the original state's assertion that "Location pos43 is clear" is incorrect. This is a problem. However, perhaps the user made a mistake, but we have to proceed with the given information. Maybe the stone is at pos43, but pos43 is clear (which is impossible). But given that, the agent can move there. But that's conflicting. This is confusing. Let me check again.

Original state:

- "stone1 is at location pos43"
- "Location pos43 is clear"

But according to the problem's definitions, if a stone is at a location, then that location is not clear. Therefore, this is impossible. So perhaps there's a mistake here. But since the user provided this, maybe there's a different interpretation. Maybe "clear" refers to the agent's absence. So a location can have a stone and still be considered clear (i.e., no agent there). So the move action's precondition (ii) requires that the location is clear (no agent there). So in that case, if a stone is there but no agent, then it's considered clear. That might be the case. So, for the move action, the destination can have a stone as long as there's no agent. Wait, but the problem states that each position may contain either the agent, a stone, or be empty. So a position cannot have both. So if a position has a stone, it can't have the agent, and vice versa. Therefore, when moving, the destination must be empty (i.e., clear of both agent and stone). Therefore, the original state's assertion that "Location pos43 is clear" is incorrect if stone1 is there. So this is a problem. But perhaps it's a typo, and the stone is at pos44, but the user wrote pos43. Alternatively, the "Location pos43 is clear" is a mistake. Since we have to work with the given problem, perhaps the stone is at pos43, and the location is not clear, but the user erroneously said it is. That would complicate things. Alternatively, maybe the initial state's "Location pos43 is clear" is a mistake and should be "Location pos43 is not clear". But we have to proceed as given.

Assuming that the initial state is correct as per the user's description, even if contradictory, but perhaps in the problem's terms, the presence of a stone doesn't affect the "clear" status. That seems unlikely. Alternatively, maybe the initial state's "Location pos43 is clear" refers to the agent not being there. So the stone is there, but the agent isn't, so it's considered clear for the agent's movement. Wait, but the move action's precondition says that l_to must be clear. If a stone is there, then the location isn't clear. Therefore, the user's initial state is contradictory. This is a problem. But since the user provided this, perhaps we should proceed under the assumption that "clear" refers only to the agent's presence. So a location is clear if the agent is not there, regardless of stones. So stones can be in locations, but they don't affect the clearness. That would mean that the move action can move into a location with a stone. But that can't be right, because pushing stones would require moving into their position. So perhaps the "clear" in move's preconditions refers to the agent not being there. But stones are allowed. Wait, but in the move action, the agent is moving to l_to. If a stone is there, then the agent can't move there, because the stone is occupying it. So in the move action's preconditions, (ii) location l_to is clear (i.e., no agent or stone there). Therefore, the initial state's description is contradictory. But perhaps the user made a mistake, and the stone is actually at a different location, but we have to proceed with what's given.

Alternatively, maybe "clear" means that there's no stone. But that also doesn't make sense. This is confusing. Given that, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem statement, but I need to proceed.

Assuming that the initial state is correct, and that "Location pos43 is clear" despite the stone being there, then the agent could move into pos43. But that's probably not intended. So perhaps the user intended that the stone is at pos43 and the location is not clear. Then, the "Location pos43 is clear" is a mistake. But since we have to work with the given problem, perhaps the stone is at pos43 and pos43 is not clear. So the initial state's "Location pos43 is clear" is wrong, but we have to proceed. This is a problem, but I'll proceed.

Assuming that the stone is at pos43 and that pos43 is not clear (correct), then the initial state has the player at pos55, stone1 at pos43. The goal is to get stone1 to a goal location (pos11). But there are constraints.

Let me try to sketch a possible path considering the constraints.

Constraints:

1. Stone1 must be at pos23 in at least one state. Then, after that, player must be at pos34 at some point.

2. Player must be at pos13 at some state, then reach pos55.

3. Stone1 must be at pos43 in some state (already in initial state, but if we move it away and then back, maybe? Or maybe the initial state counts, but the constraint requires that in some state (which could be the initial), but then after that, either pos42 is not clear or stone1 is at pos45.

4. At least one of pos34 or pos31 is not clear in some state.

5. Player must be at pos23 at some state, then reach pos41.

So, the plan must include:

- Move stone1 to pos23.

- Player must be at pos34 after that.

- Player must visit pos13 and then later pos55.

- Stone1 must be at pos43 (initial state satisfies this, but after moving it, perhaps bring it back? But that's inefficient. Alternatively, the initial state counts, but the constraint about pos42 or pos45 must be satisfied after. So after the initial state (s0), the next action must make sure that either pos42 becomes not clear (e.g., player moves there) or stone1 moves to pos45. But since stone1 starts at pos43, the first action could be to push it to pos44 (down to pos53? Wait, directions are a bit confusing. Let me check the movement directions.

Looking at the movement possibilities:

For example, from pos43, you can go to pos33 (dirleft?), but looking at the movement rules:

Looking at the movement possibilities given:

The user lists all the movement connections. For example, "You may move from location pos43 to location pos33 following direction dirleft" — so moving left from pos43 (column 3) to pos33 (column 3-1=2? Wait, the positions are labeled as posXY where X is row and Y column. So pos43 is row 4, column 3. Moving left would decrease the column number. So dirleft from pos43 would be pos42. But according to the given movement, "You may move from location pos43 to location pos33 following direction dirleft". Wait, that's confusing. Wait, the movement from pos43 to pos33 is dirleft. Wait, pos43 is row4, column3. pos33 is row3, column3. So moving up (dirup) would be from pos43 to pos33. But the movement listed says "You may move from location pos43 to location pos33 following direction dirleft". That suggests that dirleft from pos43 leads to pos33. Which doesn't make sense. Because dirleft should decrease the column. So perhaps the directions are labeled differently. Alternatively, maybe the directions are relative. This is a problem because the directions (dirup, dirdown, dirleft, dirright) are not matching the actual grid movement.

Looking at the movement from pos43 to pos33 with dirleft. So, pos43 is (4,3). pos33 is (3,3). So moving from (4,3) to (3,3) is up, but the direction is dirleft. That suggests that the directions are perhaps not standard. This complicates things.

Alternatively, maybe the directions are mapped differently. For example, dirleft could correspond to moving to the west (left in the grid), which would decrease the column. But according to the given movement, from pos43, moving dirleft goes to pos33. So pos43 (4,3) to pos33 (3,3) would be dirup, not dirleft. So there's a mistake here. But given the user's problem statement, we have to take the movement directions as given, regardless of their labels. So for pos43, moving dirleft takes you to pos33. Then dirright would take you to pos53 (since from pos43 to pos53 is dirright). Similarly, moving dirdown from pos43 takes you to pos44 (as per the given movement: "You may move from location pos43 to location pos44 following direction dirdown").

So, the directions are perhaps not the standard cardinal directions. For example, dirleft from pos43 is up to pos33, dirright is down to pos53, dirup is left, etc. This is very confusing. Therefore, we have to strictly follow the movement directions as provided in the problem statement.

Given that, let's note the possible movements from key locations:

Player starts at pos55. The stone is at pos43.

To push the stone to pos23, the player needs to navigate to a position adjacent to the stone in the direction leading towards pos23.

But first, the player needs to reach the stone. Let's see how to get from pos55 to pos43.

From pos55, the allowed movements are to pos45 (dirleft) or pos54 (dirup). Let's check:

"You may move from location pos55 to location pos45 following direction dirleft"
"You may move from location pos55 to location pos54 following direction dirup"

So from pos55, the player can move to pos45 or pos54.

To reach pos43, the player needs to go through pos45, then pos44, then pos43. Let's check:

From pos45, movements allowed are:

"You may move from location pos45 to location pos35 following direction dirleft"
"You may move from location pos45 to location pos55 following direction dirright"
"You may move from location pos45 to location pos44 following direction dirup"

So moving dirup from pos45 goes to pos44.

From pos44, movements:

"You may move from location pos44 to location pos34 following direction dirleft"
"You may move from location pos44 to location pos54 following direction dirright"
"You may move from location pos44 to location pos43 following direction dirup"
"You may move from location pos44 to location pos45 following direction dirdown"

So dirup from pos44 leads to pos43. Therefore, the path from pos55 to pos43 is:

pos55 → pos45 (dirleft), then pos45 → pos44 (dirup), then pos44 → pos43 (dirup). So three move actions.

Once the player is at pos43, but the stone is there. Wait, no: the stone is at pos43. So the player cannot move into pos43 if the stone is there. Because the move action's precondition requires that l_to is clear. But if the stone is at pos43, then pos43 is not clear. So the player can't move into pos43. Therefore, to push the stone, the player needs to be adjacent to it.

Wait, the push actions require that the player is at a location l_p, which is adjacent to the stone's location l_from. The direction d must be such that from l_p to l_from is direction d, and from l_from to l_to is also direction d.

For example, to push the stone from pos43 to pos33 (assuming direction dirleft), the player must be at pos53 (dirleft from pos43 is pos33? Wait, no. According to the problem's movement rules:

From pos43, moving dirleft leads to pos33. So pos43's dirleft is pos33. So to push the stone from pos43 to pos33, the player needs to be at pos43's direction dirleft's opposite. Wait, the player must be adjacent to l_from (pos43) in the direction d. Wait, the precondition for pushtogoal/pushtonongoal is that the player is at l_p, which is such that you can get from l_p to l_from (stone's current location) following direction d. So l_p is the location adjacent to l_from in the opposite direction of d. For example, if the stone is at l_from, and the player is at l_p, which is in the direction opposite to d from l_from. So, to push the stone in direction d, the player must be at the location from which moving in direction d leads to l_from.

Wait, for example, if the stone is at pos43 and the player wants to push it dirleft (to pos33), then the player needs to be at pos53 (since moving dirleft from pos53 to pos43). Wait, according to the movement rules, from pos53, you can move dirleft to pos43. So to push the stone from pos43 to pos33 (dirleft), the player must be at pos53 (since moving dirleft from pos53 leads to pos43). Then, pushing dirleft would move the stone from pos43 to pos33, and the player moves into pos43.

But how do we get the player to pos53?

From pos55, the player can move to pos54 (dirup), then pos53 (dirdown? Wait, looking at the movement from pos54:

"You may move from location pos54 to location pos44 following direction dirleft"
"You may move from location pos54 to location pos53 following direction dirup"
"You may move from location pos54 to location pos55 following direction dirdown"

Wait, pos54's dirup is pos53. So from pos54, moving dirup leads to pos53. So the path to pos53 could be pos55 → pos54 (dirup), then pos54 → pos53 (dirup). Then, the player is at pos53.

At pos53, the player can then push the stone at pos43 dirleft to pos33 using pushtonongoal (since pos33 is not a goal location). But wait, the goal is to get the stone to pos11, which is a goal location. So eventually, we need to push it to a goal location, but first, we need to move it to pos23 to satisfy the constraint.

But let's proceed step by step.

First, the player needs to get to a position where they can push the stone. Let's see:

Stone is at pos43. The player is at pos55. To push the stone, the player needs to be at a location adjacent to pos43 in a direction that allows pushing. The possible directions for pushing are those for which there's a movement from the player's location to pos43, and from pos43 to the next location.

Looking at pos43's movement options:

From pos43, you can move:

- dirleft to pos33
- dirright to pos53
- dirup to pos42 (wait, no, according to the movement rules given: "You may move from location pos43 to location pos42 following direction dirup". So dirup from pos43 is pos42.
- dirdown to pos44

So directions from pos43 are:

dirleft → pos33

dirright → pos53

dirup → pos42

dirdown → pos44

Thus, to push the stone in any of these directions, the player must be in the location that is in the opposite direction. For example, to push the stone dirup (to pos42), the player must be at pos43's dirup's opposite. Wait, no. The player must be at a location l_p such that moving in direction d from l_p leads to pos43. For example, to push the stone dirup from pos43 to pos42, the player needs to be at a location l_p where moving dirup from l_p leads to pos43. So pos43's dirup is pos42, so the opposite direction (dirup from l_p leads to pos43) means l_p is pos53? No. Wait, pos43's dirup is pos42. So to get to pos43 via dirup, the player would have to be at pos53, because moving dirup from pos53 leads to pos43? Let me check the movement rules.

Looking at the movement from pos53:

"You may move from location pos53 to location pos43 following direction dirleft"
"You may move from location pos53 to location pos52 following direction dirup"
"You may move from location pos53 to location pos54 following direction dirdown"

Wait, dirleft from pos53 is pos43. So to push the stone from pos43 dirup (to pos42), the player needs to be at a location l_p such that moving direction d (dirup) from l_p leads to pos43. But according to the movement rules, dirup from pos53 is to pos52. So that's not pos43. Wait, this is getting really confusing. Let's clarify:

The movement directions are as per the problem's list. For example, from pos53, moving dirleft goes to pos43. So dirleft from pos53 is pos43. Therefore, to push the stone from pos43 in direction dirleft (to pos33), the player needs to be at pos53 (since moving dirleft from pos53 leads to pos43). Then, the push action would be pushtonongoal (since pos33 is not a goal) to move the stone from pos43 to pos33, direction dirleft.

Wait, but dirleft from pos43 is to pos33. So to push the stone in dirleft from pos43, the player must be at pos53 (since dirleft from pos53 is pos43). Then, the action would be:

pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos53 pos43 pos33 dirleft

Because:

- l_p is pos53 (player's location)
- l_from is pos43 (stone's location)
- l_to is pos33 (stone's new location)
- d is dirleft (direction from l_p to l_from, and from l_from to l_to)

This action would move the stone from pos43 to pos33, and the player moves to pos43.

After this action, the stone is at pos33, and the player is at pos43.

Then, the next step could be to push the stone further towards pos23. Let's see.

From pos33, possible directions:

dirleft to pos23, dirright to pos43, dirup to pos32, dirdown to pos34.

So to push the stone to pos23, the player needs to be at a location from which dirleft leads to pos33. Looking at the movement rules for pos33:

"You may move from location pos33 to location pos23 following direction dirleft"
"You may move from location pos33 to location pos43 following direction dirright"
"You may move from location pos33 to location pos32 following direction dirup"
"You may move from location pos33 to location pos34 following direction dirdown"

So dirleft from pos33 is pos23. To push the stone dirleft from pos33 to pos23, the player must be at a location l_p where moving dirleft leads to pos33. For example, pos43 (since moving dirleft from pos43 leads to pos33). Wait, according to movement rules, from pos43, dirleft is pos33. So if the player is at pos43, they can push the stone at pos33 dirleft to pos23.

Yes. So after the first push, the player is at pos43. The stone is at pos33. Then, the player can perform:

pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos33 pos23 dirleft

This would move the stone to pos23, and the player moves to pos33.

Now, this satisfies the first constraint: stone1 is at pos23 in some state. Then, the next constraint says that after this, the player must be at pos34 at some state (either the same or later). So after pushing to pos23, the player is at pos33. To get to pos34, the player can move dirdown from pos33 to pos34.

Action: move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown

Now, the player is at pos34. This satisfies the constraint that after stone1 is at pos23, the player reaches pos34.

Now, the stone is at pos23. Next, we need to move it towards pos11. Let's think about the path. pos23 is in row2, column3. To reach pos11 (row1, column1), the stone needs to move left twice and up once, or up and left. Let's see the possible directions.

From pos23, the stone can be pushed:

dirleft to pos13, dirright to pos33, dirup to pos22, dirdown to pos24.

To get closer to pos11, pushing dirleft to pos13 would be better. Then from pos13, dirleft to pos12, then to pos11. But pos11 is a goal location. So the plan would involve pushing the stone from pos23 to pos13, then to pos12, then to pos11.

But let's check if that's possible.

First, from pos23 to pos13: dirleft from pos23 is pos13. To push the stone dirleft from pos23, the player must be at pos33 (since dirleft from pos33 leads to pos23). But after pushing to pos23, the player is at pos33, then moves to pos34. So to push from pos23, the player needs to get back to a position adjacent to pos23.

Wait, the player is at pos34. To push the stone from pos23, the player needs to be at a location from which moving in direction d leads to pos23. For example, to push dirup from pos23 to pos13, the player needs to be at pos24 (since moving dirup from pos24 leads to pos23? Let's check movement rules.

Looking at movement from pos24:

"You may move from location pos24 to location pos14 following direction dirleft"
"You may move from location pos24 to location pos34 following direction dirright"
"You may move from location pos24 to location pos23 following direction dirup"
"You may move from location pos24 to location pos25 following direction dirdown"

So dirup from pos24 leads to pos23. Therefore, to push the stone from pos23 dirup to pos13, the player must be at pos24 and push dirup. But the stone is at pos23. So the player needs to be at pos24, then push the stone dirup (from pos23 to pos13). Wait, no: pushing requires the player to be adjacent in the direction of the push. Let me clarify.

The push action requires that the player is at l_p, and the stone is at l_from. The direction d must be such that moving from l_p to l_from is d, and from l_from to l_to is also d. So for pushing the stone from pos23 to pos13 (dirup), the player must be at pos24 (since moving dirup from pos24 leads to pos23). Then, pushing dirup would move the stone from pos23 to pos13 (dirup from pos23 is pos13? Let's check movement from pos23:

"You may move from location pos23 to location pos13 following direction dirleft"
"You may move from location pos23 to location pos33 following direction dirright"
"You may move from location pos23 to location pos22 following direction dirup"
"You may move from location pos23 to location pos24 following direction dirdown"

Wait, dirleft from pos23 is pos13. So to push the stone from pos23 to pos13, the direction would be dirleft. So the player needs to be at a location l_p where moving dirleft leads to pos23. Which location is that?

Looking at movement rules: pos33 moving dirleft leads to pos23. Because from pos33, "You may move from location pos33 to location pos23 following direction dirleft". So to push the stone from pos23 dirleft to pos13, the player must be at pos33 (since moving dirleft from pos33 leads to pos23). Then, pushing dirleft would move the stone to pos13.

But after the player moved to pos34, they need to get back to pos33 to perform this push.

So steps:

From pos34, the player can move dirup to pos33 (if possible). Let's check movement from pos34:

"You may move from location pos34 to location pos24 following direction dirleft"
"You may move from location pos34 to location pos44 following direction dirright"
"You may move from location pos34 to location pos33 following direction dirup"
"You may move from location pos34 to location pos35 following direction dirdown"

Yes, moving dirup from pos34 leads to pos33. So player moves from pos34 to pos33 (dirup).

Then, the player is at pos33. Now, can push the stone from pos23 to pos13 dirleft:

pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos23 pos13 dirleft

This moves the stone to pos13, player to pos23.

Now, the stone is at pos13. Next, push it to pos12 (dirleft from pos13). To do that, the player needs to be at pos23 (since dirleft from pos23 leads to pos13). Wait, no: dirleft from pos13 is pos12. To push dirleft from pos13 to pos12, the player must be at pos23 (since moving dirleft from pos23 leads to pos13). Wait, no. Let's check movement from pos13:

"You may move from location pos13 to location pos23 following direction dirright"
"You may move from location pos13 to location pos12 following direction dirup"
"You may move from location pos13 to location pos14 following direction dirdown"

Wait, dirleft from pos13 would be pos12? No, according to the movement rules, moving dirup from pos13 leads to pos12. So to push the stone from pos13 to pos12, the direction is dirup. Therefore, the player needs to be at pos14 (since moving dirup from pos14 leads to pos13). Let's check:

Movement from pos14: "You may move from location pos14 to location pos24 following direction dirright", etc. Wait, looking for movement to pos13. From pos12, moving dirdown leads to pos13. So to get to pos13 from pos12 is dirdown. To push the stone from pos13 to pos12 via dirup, the player must be at pos14 (dirup from pos14 leads to pos13). Wait, movement from pos14 to pos13 is dirup. So to push the stone from pos13 to pos12, the direction is dirup. So the player must be at pos14, push dirup to pos13, then pos12.

But the player is currently at pos23 after pushing the stone to pos13. So they need to move to pos14. Let's see the path from pos23 to pos14.

From pos23, possible movements:

"You may move from location pos23 to location pos13 following direction dirleft"
"You may move from location pos23 to location pos33 following direction dirright"
"You may move from location pos23 to location pos22 following direction dirup"
"You may move from location pos23 to location pos24 following direction dirdown"

So from pos23, the player can move to pos24 (dirdown), then pos34 (dirright from pos24 is pos34), then pos33 (dirup), then pos34 → pos44 (dirright), etc. This seems complicated. Alternatively, maybe a different path.

Alternatively, after the stone is at pos13, the player is at pos23. To push the stone to pos12 (dirup from pos13), the player needs to be at pos14 (since moving dirup from pos14 leads to pos13). So how to get from pos23 to pos14.

Possible path:

pos23 → pos24 (dirdown), then pos24 → pos14 (dirleft). Let's check:

From pos23, move dirdown to pos24. Then, from pos24, dirleft to pos14.

Yes. So actions:

move player1 pos23 pos24 dirdown

move player1 pos24 pos14 dirleft

Now, the player is at pos14. Then, push the stone from pos13 to pos12 dirup:

pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos14 pos13 pos12 dirup

This moves the stone to pos12, player to pos13.

Now, the stone is at pos12. Next, push it to pos11 (dirleft from pos12). To push dirleft from pos12 to pos11, the player must be at pos22 (since moving dirleft from pos22 leads to pos12). Let's check movement from pos22:

"You may move from location pos22 to location pos12 following direction dirleft"

Yes. So the player needs to be at pos22. Current player position is pos13. How to get to pos22.

From pos13, possible movements:

pos13 → pos23 (dirright), pos13 → pos12 (dirup), pos13 → pos14 (dirdown). But pos12 has the stone, so it's not clear. The player can't move there. So from pos13, move to pos23 (dirright), then pos23 → pos22 (dirup), then pos22.

Actions:

move player1 pos13 pos23 dirright

move player1 pos23 pos22 dirup

Now, the player is at pos22. Then, push the stone from pos12 to pos11 dirleft:

pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos12 pos11 dirleft

Because pos11 is a goal location. This action moves the stone to pos11, achieving the goal.

Now, we need to check all constraints:

- Stone1 was at pos23 (satisfied when we pushed it there).

- After stone1 is at pos23, the player was at pos34 (satisfied when the player moved to pos34 after pushing to pos23).

- Player must be at pos13 at some state. This happened when the player pushed the stone from pos23 to pos13, moving to pos23, then later moved to pos13 when pushing to pos12.

Wait, no: after pushing the stone to pos13, the player was at pos23. Then, when moving to pos24 and pos14, then pushing to pos12, the player moved to pos13. So yes, player was at pos13.

Then, the player must reach pos55 after being at pos13. So after being at pos13, the player moved to pos23, then pos24, pos14, etc. But we need to ensure that after being at pos13, the player eventually gets to pos55.

So after pos13, the player moves to pos23, then pos22, and after pushing to pos11, the player is at pos12. Wait, no: after pushing the stone to pos11 from pos12, the player would be at pos12. Then, the player needs to move to pos55.

But how? Let's see.

After the final push, the player is at pos12 (since they pushed from pos22 to pos12, dirleft. Wait, no: the push action is pushtogoal, so after pushing, the player moves to pos12's previous location (l_from is pos12, so player moves to pos12). Wait, the effect of pushtogoal is:

(i) agent p is no longer at l_p (pos22)
(ii) stone s is no longer at l_from (pos12)
(iii) l_to is no longer clear (pos11)
(iv) agent p is at l_from (pos12)
(v) stone s is at l_to (pos11)
(vi) l_p (pos22) is clear
(vi) stone s is at a goal state.

So after pushing, the player is at pos12. Then, the player needs to get to pos55.

Path from pos12 to pos55:

pos12 → pos22 (dirright), then pos22 → pos32 (dirright), pos32 → pos42 (dirright), pos42 → pos52 (dirright), pos52 → pos53 (dirdown), pos53 → pos54 (dirdown), pos54 → pos55 (dirdown).

But that's a lot of steps. However, the constraint says that after the player is at pos13, they must reach pos55. So the player was at pos13, then went to pos23, pos24, pos14, etc., but eventually needs to get to pos55.

Alternatively, after the stone is at pos11, the player can move directly from pos12 to pos22, then pos32, pos42, pos52, pos53, pos54, pos55. But this is a long path. However, this is part of the plan to satisfy the constraint that after being at pos13, the player reaches pos55.

Another constraint is that the player must be at pos23 at some state and then reach pos41. In our current plan, the player was at pos23 when moving from pos13 to pos23. Then, after that, the player moved to pos24, pos14, etc. But we need to ensure that after being at pos23, the player reaches pos41.

So after the player is at pos23, they need to eventually reach pos41. How?

In the current plan, after pos23, the player moves to pos24, then to pos14, then to pos22, etc. This doesn't include pos41. So we need to adjust the plan to include a visit to pos41 after pos23.

So perhaps after the player is at pos23 (when pushing the stone to pos13), they need to later go to pos41. How to fit that in.

Alternatively, after the stone is at pos11, the player can move from pos12 to pos22, then to pos32, pos42, pos52, pos53, pos54, pos55. But pos41 is in row4, column1. So how to get there from pos12.

Alternatively, after the player is at pos23, perhaps they can move to pos24, then pos34, pos44, pos43, etc., and then to pos41. But this would add steps.

This complicates the plan. Let's think of a way to satisfy all constraints.

Another constraint is that in some state, either pos34 or pos31 is not clear. In our current plan, pos34 was occupied by the player when they moved there after pushing the stone to pos23. So pos34 was not clear in that state, satisfying the constraint.

Another constraint is that stone1 is at pos43 in some state. The initial state satisfies this, but after moving it, do we need to bring it back? No, because the initial state already counts. So that constraint is satisfied.

But the constraint related to stone1 being at pos43 says that after that state, either pos42 is not clear or stone1 is at pos45. In the initial state, stone1 is at pos43. So we need to ensure that after the initial state (which is s0), either pos42 becomes not clear (e.g., player moves there) or stone1 moves to pos45. Since the first action is pushing the stone to pos33, which moves it away from pos43, but the constraint is about when stone1 is at pos43. Since the initial state is the only state where stone1 is at pos43, the subsequent actions must ensure that either pos42 is not clear or stone1 is at pos45 after the initial state. But after the initial state, the stone is moved to pos33, so the constraint is about s0. Therefore, in s0, the stone is at pos43. Then, in s0, either pos42 is not clear (which it is, since initially pos42 is clear) or stone1 is at pos45 (which it's not). Therefore, after s0 (i.e., in the next state), we need to make sure that pos42 is not clear or stone1 is at pos45. 

But in our initial plan, the first action is pushing the stone from pos43 to pos33, which moves it away. Therefore, after s0, in s1, stone1 is at pos33. Therefore, the constraint would require that in s0 or any state after, either pos42 is not clear or stone1 is at pos45. In s0, pos42 is clear. So we need to ensure that in some state after s0, either pos42 is not clear or stone1 is at pos45. 

But our current plan doesn't have the stone at pos45. So we need to make sure that pos42 becomes not clear (i.e., the player or another stone is there). Since there's only one stone, we have to have the player move to pos42 at some point.

In our current plan, after pushing the stone to pos33, the player is at pos43. Then, they move to pos33, then pos34, then back to pos33, etc. So to get pos42 not clear, the player can move to pos42 at some point.

For example, after pushing the stone to pos33 and being at pos43, the player can move to pos42 (dirup from pos43 is pos42). But can they?

From pos43, moving dirup leads to pos42. So action: move player1 pos43 pos42 dirup.

This would make pos42 not clear (since the player is there). This would satisfy the constraint.

So inserting this step after the first push:

After pushtonongoal to pos33, the player is at pos43. Then, move to pos42.

So the steps would be:

1. move player1 pos55 pos45 dirleft

2. move player1 pos45 pos44 dirup

3. move player1 pos44 pos43 dirup

Wait, no. Wait, the initial stone is at pos43, so the player can't move there. So the initial steps must be:

Player is at pos55. To push the stone at pos43, the player needs to be at pos53, then push dirleft to pos33.

But earlier analysis showed that the player can move from pos55 → pos54 (dirup), then pos54 → pos53 (dirup). Then, perform the push.

So revised steps:

1. move player1 pos55 pos54 dirup

2. move player1 pos54 pos53 dirup

3. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos53 pos43 pos33 dirleft

Now, player is at pos43.

Then, to satisfy the constraint, the player can move to pos42:

4. move player1 pos43 pos42 dirup

Now, pos42 is not clear, satisfying the constraint that after stone1 is at pos43 (in s0), pos42 is not clear in a subsequent state.

Then, proceed to push the stone to pos23:

5. move player1 pos42 pos43 dirleft (wait, can't because pos43 is clear? After pushing, the player is at pos43, but after moving to pos42, the player is at pos42. To push from pos33 to pos23, the player needs to be at pos43 (dirleft from pos43 leads to pos33). Wait, no. Let's think again.

After step 3, the stone is at pos33, and the player is at pos43. Then step 4: player moves to pos42. Then, the stone is at pos33. To push it to pos23, the player needs to be at pos43 (since dirleft from pos43 leads to pos33). So player needs to move back to pos43.

But pos43 is clear after step 3, because after pushing, the player moves to pos43. Then, moving to pos42 (step4) makes pos43 clear again. So player can move back to pos43.

So step 5: move player1 pos42 pos43 dirup (from pos42 to pos43 is dirup).

Then step6: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos33 pos23 dirleft

Now, stone is at pos23, player at pos33.

Then step7: move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown (satisfying the constraint that after stone is at pos23, player is at pos34).

Then continue as before.

But this adds steps. Now, let's check all constraints:

- Stone1 at pos23: yes in step6.

- Player at pos34: step7.

- Player at pos13: when pushing to pos13.

- After pos13, player must reach pos55: need to ensure that after being at pos13, player eventually gets to pos55.

- Player at pos23: step6, then must reach pos41.

So after step6, player is at pos33. Then step7: pos34. Then need to reach pos41.

How to get to pos41 from pos34.

Path from pos34 to pos41:

pos34 → pos44 (dirright), pos44 → pos43 (dirup), pos43 → pos53 (dirright), pos53 → pos52 (dirup), pos52 → pos42 (dirleft), pos42 → pos41 (dirup).

But that's a long way. Alternatively, pos34 → pos24 (dirleft), pos24 → pos14 (dirleft), pos14 → pos13 (dirup), but then from pos13, need to get to pos41.

Alternatively, after pushing the stone to pos11, the player can navigate to pos41.

But this is getting too complicated. Let's see if there's a more optimal path.

Alternatively, after step7 (player at pos34), they can move to pos44 (dirright), then to pos54 (dirright), then to pos55 (dirdown). But that doesn't reach pos41.

Alternatively, from pos34, move to pos44 (dirright), then pos44 → pos43 (dirup), then pos43 → pos42 (dirup), then pos42 → pos41 (dirup).

Yes:

Step8: move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright

Step9: move player1 pos44 pos43 dirup

Step10: move player1 pos43 pos42 dirup

Step11: move player1 pos42 pos41 dirup

Now, player is at pos41, satisfying the constraint that after being at pos23 (step6), they reach pos41 (step11).

But this adds steps. However, the problem requires an optimal plan with minimal length. So this approach might not be optimal. 

But given the constraints, perhaps we need to interleave these steps. Let's try to rework the plan to include all constraints with minimal steps.

Alternative approach:

1. Move player from pos55 to pos53 (steps: pos55 → pos54 → pos53).

2. Push stone from pos43 to pos33 (dirleft), player at pos43.

3. Move player to pos42 (dirup from pos43).

   This satisfies the constraint that after stone is at pos43 (initial state), pos42 is not clear.

4. Move player from pos42 to pos43 (dirup).

5. Push stone from pos33 to pos23 (dirleft), player at pos33.

6. Move player to pos34 (dirdown).

7. Move player to pos44 (dirright).

8. Move player to pos43 (dirup).

9. Move player to pos42 (dirup).

10. Move player to pos41 (dirup).

   This satisfies the constraint that after being at pos23 (step5), player reaches pos41.

11. Now, need to get back to pos33 to push stone to pos13.

But this is getting too long. Maybe there's a better way.

Alternative plan:

1. Move player to pos53 (pos55 → pos54 → pos53).

2. Push stone to pos33 (dirleft), player at pos43.

3. Move to pos42 (satisfy pos42 not clear).

4. Move to pos43, then push stone to pos23 (player at pos33).

5. Move to pos34.

6. Move to pos44, then pos43, pos42, pos41 (satisfy pos41 after pos23).

7. Then, return to pos33 to push stone to pos13.

But this is very lengthy.

Alternatively, after step5 (stone at pos23, player at pos33):

- Move to pos34 (step6).

- Then, move to pos44 (step7), then to pos43 (step8), then to pos42 (step9), then to pos41 (step10).

   Now, player is at pos41 (satisfies constraint after pos23).

- Then, player needs to get back to pos33 to push the stone to pos13.

But this is adding many steps. Perhaps there's a more optimal path.

Alternatively, after pushing the stone to pos23, the player is at pos33. They need to reach pos41. So from pos33, possible moves:

pos33 → pos32 (dirup), then pos32 → pos31 (dirleft), pos31 → pos41 (dirright). So steps:

step6: move player1 pos33 pos32 dirup

step7: move player1 pos32 pos31 dirleft

step8: move player1 pos31 pos41 dirright

This gets the player to pos41 in three moves from pos33. This satisfies the constraint that after being at pos23 (step5), the player reaches pos41 (step8). This is shorter.

Then, after reaching pos41, the player needs to get back to pos33 to push the stone to pos13. So steps:

step9: move player1 pos41 pos31 dirleft

step10: move player1 pos31 pos32 dirdown

step11: move player1 pos32 pos33 dirdown

step12: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos23 pos13 dirleft

Then, proceed to push to pos11 as before.

This adds steps but may be necessary to satisfy constraints.

However, the goal is to find an optimal (shortest) plan. Let's count the steps in this approach:

1. move 55→54
2. move 54→53
3. pushtonongoal to 33 (stone at 33)
4. move 53→43 (but wait, after pushing, player is at pos43)
   No: step3 is pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos53 pos43 pos33 dirleft. After this action, player is at pos43.

Then:

4. move 43→42 (dirup) to satisfy pos42 not clear
5. move 42→43 (dirup)
6. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos33 pos23 dirleft (stone at 23, player at 33)
7. move 33→34 (dirdown)
8. move 34→33 (dirup)
9. move 33→32 (dirup)
10. move 32→31 (dirleft)
11. move 31→41 (dirright) → satisfies pos41 after pos23
12. move 41→31 (dirleft)
13. move 31→32 (dirdown)
14. move 32→33 (dirdown)
15. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos23 pos13 dirleft (stone at 13, player at 23)
16. move 23→24 (dirdown)
17. move 24→14 (dirleft)
18. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos14 pos13 pos12 dirup (stone at 12, player at 13)
19. move 13→23 (dirright)
20. move 23→22 (dirup)
21. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos12 pos11 dirleft (stone at 11)
22. move 12→22 (dirright)
23. move 22→32 (dirright)
24. move 32→42 (dirright)
25. move 42→52 (dirright)
26. move 52→53 (dirdown)
27. move 53→54 (dirdown)
28. move 54→55 (dirdown)

This is way too long. The optimal plan should be much shorter.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a different path that satisfies all constraints with fewer steps.

Alternative idea: Use the initial position to satisfy some constraints.

For example, the player starts at pos55. One of the constraints is that the player must be at pos23 at some point and then reach pos41. So after pushing the stone to pos23, the player needs to go to pos41. Maybe after moving to pos34, the player can go to pos44, then to pos43, pos42, pos41.

But this is time-consuming.

Alternatively, after pushing the stone to pos23, the player is at pos33. Then, they move to pos34, then to pos44, then to pos43, pos42, pos41.

Steps:

After stone is at pos23 (step6):

7. move 33→34 (dirdown)
8. move 34→44 (dirright)
9. move 44→43 (dirup)
10. move 43→42 (dirup)
11. move 42→41 (dirup)

This gets the player to pos41 (step11). Then, they need to return to push the stone further.

But this adds many steps.

Another constraint is that the player must be at pos13 at some point and then reach pos55. So after pushing the stone to pos13, the player is at pos23. Then, they need to eventually reach pos55.

But this requires a long path.

Given the complexity, perhaps the optimal plan has around 20 steps. But this seems unlikely. There must be a smarter way.

Alternative approach: Use the fact that the player must be at pos13 and then pos55. Maybe after pushing the stone to pos11, the player can move from pos12 to pos22, pos32, pos42, pos52, pos53, pos54, pos55. That's 6 moves. This would satisfy the pos13 → pos55 constraint.

Similarly, after being at pos23, the player moves to pos34, then to pos44, pos43, pos42, pos41. That's 5 moves. 

But integrating all these steps into the plan without redundancy is challenging.

Perhaps the minimal plan is as follows:

1. Move player from pos55 to pos54 (dirup)
2. Move to pos53 (dirup)
3. Push stone from pos43 to pos33 (dirleft) → player at pos43
4. Move to pos42 (dirup) → satisfies pos42 not clear after initial state
5. Move back to pos43 (dirup)
6. Push stone from pos33 to pos23 (dirleft) → player at pos33
7. Move to pos34 (dirdown)
8. Move to pos44 (dirright)
9. Move to pos43 (dirup)
10. Move to pos42 (dirup)
11. Move to pos41 (dirup) → satisfies pos41 after pos23
12. Move back to pos31 (dirleft)
13. Move to pos32 (dirdown)
14. Move to pos33 (dirdown)
15. Push stone from pos23 to pos13 (dirleft) → player at pos23
16. Move to pos24 (dirdown)
17. Move to pos14 (dirleft)
18. Push stone from pos13 to pos12 (dirup) → player at pos13
19. Move to pos23 (dirright)
20. Move to pos22 (dirup)
21. Push stone to pos11 (dirleft) → player at pos12
22. Move to pos22 (dirright)
23. Move to pos32 (dirright)
24. Move to pos42 (dirright)
25. Move to pos52 (dirright)
26. Move to pos53 (dirdown)
27. Move to pos54 (dirdown)
28. Move to pos55 (dirdown)

This includes all necessary steps but is quite long. However, the problem requires an optimal plan, which is the shortest possible. Therefore, there must be a shorter path.

Alternative idea: Use the pushtogoal action directly if possible. For example, pushing the stone from pos43 to pos33 (non-goal), then to pos23 (non-goal), then to pos13 (non-goal), then to pos12 (non-goal), then to pos11 (goal). This requires several push actions.

But each push action requires the player to be in the correct position.

Perhaps the optimal plan is as follows:

1. Move player from pos55 to pos54 (dirup)
2. Move to pos53 (dirup)
3. Push stone from pos43 to pos33 (dirleft) → player at pos43
4. Move to pos42 (dirup) → satisfies pos42 not clear
5. Move back to pos43 (dirup)
6. Push stone from pos33 to pos23 (dirleft) → player at pos33
7. Move to pos34 (dirdown)
8. Move to pos44 (dirright)
9. Move to pos43 (dirup)
10. Move to pos42 (dirup)
11. Move to pos41 (dirup) → satisfies pos41 after pos23
12. Move back to pos31 (dirleft)
13. Move to pos32 (dirdown)
14. Move to pos33 (dirdown)
15. Push stone from pos23 to pos13 (dirleft) → player at pos23
16. Move to pos14 (dirleft from pos24 after moving down)
17. Push stone from pos13 to pos12 (dirup) → player at pos13
18. Move to pos22 (via pos23 and dirup)
19. Push stone to pos11 (dirleft)
20. Move player to pos55 via long path.

But this still has many steps. Maybe there's a smarter way to satisfy the constraints with fewer steps.

Another observation: The constraint that pos34 or pos31 is not clear can be satisfied when the player moves through pos34. Which happens after step7.

The constraint that stone1 is at pos43 is satisfied in the initial state, and after step3, it's moved. The related constraint is satisfied by step4 (pos42 not clear).

The constraint that player is at pos13 is satisfied in step17 (when pushing to pos12).

After pos13, the player moves to pos23, then to pos22, and eventually to pos55 via multiple steps.

The constraint that player is at pos23 is satisfied in step6 and step15.

After pos23, the player moves to pos41 in step11.

This seems to cover all constraints. However, the number of steps is still large.

Given the time constraints, perhaps the optimal plan is as follows, although I'm not certain:

```

But I'm not sure if this satisfies all the constraints. Let's check each constraint:

1. Stone1 must be at pos23: yes, in step5.

2. After stone1 is at pos23, player must be at pos34: step6.

3. Player must be at pos13: step7 (after pushing to pos13, player is at pos23?), wait step7 is pushtonongoal to pos13, player moves to pos23. No, step7 is pushtonongoal from pos23 to pos13, so player moves to pos23. So player is at pos23 after step7, not pos13. So this doesn't satisfy the player being at pos13.

Hmm, this approach is not correct. Therefore, perhaps the correct plan requires more steps.

Given the complexity and time constraints, I'll provide a possible plan that satisfies all constraints, but I'm not certain if it's optimal.
