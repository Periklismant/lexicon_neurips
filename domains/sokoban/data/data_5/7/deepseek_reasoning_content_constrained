Okay, let's tackle this planning problem step by step. The goal is to move stone1 to a goal location, which in this case is pos42. The initial state has the player at pos45 and the stone at pos23. The constraints add some complexity, so I need to make sure each one is satisfied.

First, let's look at the constraints one by one:

1. **Constraint 1**: "Location pos42 is not clear" must hold in at least one state. So, at some point, either the player or another stone (but there's only stone1) must be at pos42. Since stone1 is the only stone, unless we push it there, but pos42 is a goal. If we push stone1 to pos42, that's allowed. But since the task is to get stone1 to a goal, pushing it to pos42 would satisfy both the main goal and this constraint.

2. **Constraint 2**: If pos42 is not clear at some state, there must be an earlier state where either stone1 is at pos44 or the player is at pos42. Since pos42 is a goal, maybe the player moves there first, then pushes the stone. But stone1 starts at pos23, so getting it to pos44 would require moving it through several positions. Alternatively, the player could move to pos42 first, which would satisfy the condition.

3. **Constraint 3**: pos22 must always be clear. So the player or stones can never be at pos22. The stone starts at pos23, which is adjacent. The player can't move through pos22, and when moving stones, must avoid pushing them into pos22. Also, the stone can't pass through pos22.

4. **Constraint 4**: pos24 being not clear can happen in at most one continuous sequence. So once something is in pos24, it can't be left and then reoccupied again. But since we're moving stone1, maybe we can avoid pos24 altogether. However, depending on the path, this might come into play. Need to check possible paths.

5. **Constraint 5**: At least one state must have pos11 not clear or stone1 at pos33. Since pos11 is initially clear, the player could move there to make it not clear. Alternatively, moving stone1 to pos33 would satisfy this. But moving the stone to pos33 might be a detour. Let's see if that's necessary.

6. **Constraint 6**: At least one state must have the player at pos31 or stone1 at pos33. Again, pos31 is a location the player might pass through when moving from pos45 to pos23, or stone1 could be moved to pos33.

So the main goal is to get stone1 to pos42. Let's plan the path for that. The stone starts at pos23. The player is at pos45. The player needs to navigate to the stone's position and push it towards pos42.

Possible path for the player to reach the stone:

From pos45, the player can move up to pos44, then left to pos34, up to pos33, left to pos23 (but wait, pos23 is where the stone is, but initially, pos23 is clear. Wait, the initial state says "stone1 is at location pos23" and "Location pos23 is clear". Wait, that's a contradiction? Wait, no. Because "Location pos23 is clear" in the initial state. But a location is clear if there's nothing there. But the stone is at pos23. Wait, that's a problem. Wait, looking back at the original state:

Wait, original state says "stone1 is at location pos23" and "Location pos23 is clear". That's impossible. Because if a stone is there, the location isn't clear. Wait, this must be an error. Let me check again.

Looking at the original state:

The original state lists:

- "stone1 is at location pos23"

Then under "Location pos23 is clear" â€” that's conflicting. Because if the stone is there, the location can't be clear. So maybe that's a mistake in the problem statement. But assuming that the problem is correctly specified, perhaps "clear" here refers to the presence of the agent? Wait, the problem says "Each position on the grid may contain either the agent, a stone or be empty." So a location is clear if it's empty. So if a stone is there, it's not clear. Therefore, the initial state has a contradiction. But since the problem states it, I have to take it as given. Wait, the original state says "stone1 is at location pos23" and "Location pos23 is clear". That must be a mistake. But maybe in the problem, "clear" refers to the agent not being there. Wait, the problem's description says "Each position on the grid may contain either the agent, a stone or be empty." So a location is clear if it doesn't have the agent or a stone. So if a stone is present, the location is not clear. Therefore, the initial state's "Location pos23 is clear" is incorrect if the stone is there. But the problem states both. That's a problem. But perhaps it's a typo. Let me check the original state again.

Looking back:

The original state includes:

"player1 is at location pos45"

"stone1 is at location pos23"

"Location pos23 is clear"

But according to the problem's definition, if a stone is at a location, that location is not clear. So this seems contradictory. But perhaps in the problem's context, "clear" refers to the agent not being present. Wait, the problem says: "Each position on the grid may contain either the agent, a stone or be empty. Each position is flagged as either a goal position or a non-goal position." So each location can be in one of three states: has agent, has stone, or empty. Therefore, "clear" would mean empty. So the initial state says pos23 has the stone, but also is clear. That's impossible. Therefore, there's a mistake in the problem. But the problem is given as such, so perhaps "Location pos23 is clear" is a typo. Let me check again all the "clear" statements in the original state.

The original state lists:

"Location pos11 is clear"

... (many locations) ...

"Location pos23 is clear"

But stone1 is at pos23. So that's conflicting. Therefore, this must be an error in the problem statement. However, since the problem is given as is, I have to work with it. Maybe "clear" here refers to the agent not being there. So perhaps "clear" in the initial state only refers to the agent's presence. Then, a location can have a stone and still be considered clear. That would resolve the contradiction. But according to the problem's initial description, each location can contain the agent, a stone, or be empty. So "clear" would mean neither agent nor stone is present. Therefore, the initial state's "Location pos23 is clear" is incorrect. But since the problem states it, perhaps "clear" is defined differently here. Alternatively, maybe "clear" in the initial state refers to the agent's presence only, and stones don't affect it. But that contradicts the problem's description.

This is confusing. Let's proceed under the assumption that the initial state is correctly specified, perhaps with "clear" meaning the agent isn't there, regardless of stones. So in that case, pos23 has a stone but is considered clear because the agent isn't there. Then, when the agent moves into pos23, it becomes not clear. But this is inconsistent with the problem's initial description, which says locations can have agent, stone, or be empty. So perhaps "clear" is a separate flag. But that's not standard. This seems like a problem statement error. But given that, perhaps I should proceed with the given information, assuming that "clear" refers to the agent not being present. Therefore, even if a stone is at a location, it's considered clear as long as the agent isn't there. That would make the initial state possible. So, stone1 is at pos23, and pos23 is clear (agent not there). Then, when the agent moves to pos23, pos23 becomes not clear. But the stone is still there. But according to the problem's description, each location can contain either the agent, a stone, or be empty. So a location can't have both agent and stone. Therefore, the presence of a stone makes the location not clear (since it's occupied by the stone). Therefore, the initial state's assertion that pos23 is clear is impossible. This is a problem.

Given this inconsistency, perhaps the problem intended that pos23 is not clear (since the stone is there), but it was listed as clear by mistake. Alternatively, maybe the stone's presence doesn't affect the clearness. Given that the problem's actions have effects where moving a stone to a location makes it not clear, perhaps the presence of a stone does make a location not clear. Therefore, the initial state's "Location pos23 is clear" is a mistake. But since the problem states it, perhaps we have to proceed with that. This is a critical point because if pos23 is clear, then the agent can move there. But if the stone is there, then according to the problem's rules, the agent can't move into a location with a stone. Wait, the move action's precondition is that the destination is clear. So if pos23 has the stone, it's not clear, so the agent can't move there. But according to the initial state, pos23 is clear, which would allow the agent to move there. But the stone is there. So this is a contradiction. Therefore, I think there's a mistake in the problem statement, but since we have to work with it, perhaps the stone is not considered when determining if a location is clear. But that's not standard. Alternatively, the problem's initial state may have a typo, and the stone is actually at a different location, but that's not for us to decide.

Alternatively, perhaps "clear" in the problem's initial state refers to the agent's absence. So even if a stone is present, the location is considered clear if the agent isn't there. In that case, the agent can move to a location with a stone, but that's not possible according to the problem's description. Therefore, this is confusing. Let's try to proceed under the assumption that the initial state is correct, even if contradictory. So the stone is at pos23, and pos23 is clear. Therefore, the agent can move to pos23. But according to the problem's description, a location can't have both the agent and a stone. So moving to pos23 would require that the stone is not there. Therefore, the initial state is impossible. This is a problem.

Given this confusion, perhaps the problem intended that pos23 is not clear. Let's assume that the initial state has a typo and that pos23 is not clear (since the stone is there). Therefore, the agent can't move there. Then, the stone is at pos23, and the agent is at pos45. The agent needs to reach the stone to push it. So the agent's path from pos45 to pos23 must avoid pos22 (since pos22 must remain clear at all times). Let's map the possible paths.

The player is at pos45. They need to reach pos23. The grid is 5x5. Let's see the movement directions provided.

Looking at the movement possibilities:

From pos45, the player can move left to pos44 (dirup?), wait, the directions are dirup, dirdown, dirleft, dirright. Wait, the movement directions are given as, for example, "You may move from location pos45 to location pos35 following direction dirleft" â€” so moving left from pos45 would be to pos44? Wait, no. Wait, pos45 is row 4, column5. Moving left (dirleft) would decrease the column by 1, so pos44. Similarly, moving up (dirup) would decrease the row by 1, so pos35. Let's confirm the movement connections.

For example, "You may move from location pos45 to location pos35 following direction dirleft". Wait, pos45 to pos35 is moving up (row 4 to row 3), but the direction is dirleft. That seems inconsistent. Wait, perhaps the directions are based on standard grid movement, where dirup is north (row decreases), dirleft is west (column decreases), etc.

Wait, the movement connections are given in the problem. For example, "You may move from location pos45 to location pos35 following direction dirleft". Wait, pos45 is (4,5), pos35 is (3,5). So moving from pos45 to pos35 is moving up (dirleft?), but that seems like a mistake. Alternatively, the directions might be labeled differently. Let's check another example. "You may move from location pos45 to location pos55 following direction dirright". pos45 to pos55 is column 5 to 5? No, that's same column. Wait, pos45 is (4,5), pos55 is (5,5). So moving down (dirdown) from pos45 would be to pos55? But according to the problem, "You may move from location pos45 to location pos55 following direction dirright". Wait, that's moving right, but in a 5x5 grid, moving right from (4,5) would stay at column 5, which is the maximum. So this suggests that the movement directions might be mapped differently. Perhaps the directions are based on the grid's adjacency, not standard directions. For example, dirright could mean moving east (column increases), dirleft west (column decreases), dirup north (row decreases), dirdown south (row increases). So pos45 (row4, column5) moving dirright would go to column6, which doesn't exist, so that's not possible. But according to the problem's movement list, from pos45, you can move to pos35 (row3, column5) via dirleft. That would imply that dirleft here corresponds to moving up (row decreases). Similarly, moving dirright from pos45 to pos55 (row5, column5) would be moving down (row increases). So the directions are perhaps mislabeled. Alternatively, the directions are mapped as:

- dirup: row decreases

- dirdown: row increases

- dirleft: column decreases

- dirright: column increases

But according to the movement list, for example, "You may move from location pos45 to location pos35 following direction dirleft". pos45 is (4,5), moving dirleft (column decreases) would go to (4,4) pos44. But the movement says pos35 (3,5). So that's a problem. Therefore, the directions might be labeled differently. Alternatively, perhaps the movement connections are provided as per the problem's specific adjacency list, and the directions are arbitrary. Therefore, the directions are just labels, and the actual movement is determined by the given allowed moves.

Given that, the movement from pos45 to pos35 is via dirleft. So when the agent is at pos45, moving dirleft takes them to pos35. Similarly, moving dirright from pos45 takes them to pos55. Moving dirup from pos45 takes them to pos44. Wait, the problem states:

"You may move from location pos45 to location pos35 following direction dirleft"

"You may move from location pos45 to location pos55 following direction dirright"

"You may move from location pos45 to location pos44 following direction dirup"

So from pos45:

- dirup: pos44

- dirleft: pos35

- dirright: pos55

So the directions are a bit confusing. So the agent's movement is not standard grid directions. So I need to rely entirely on the allowed moves provided.

Given that, let's try to find a path from pos45 to pos23, avoiding pos22 (since it must always be clear) and considering the movement options.

Starting at pos45:

Possible moves from pos45:

- dirup to pos44

- dirleft to pos35

- dirright to pos55

Let's consider moving dirup to pos44 first.

From pos44, possible moves:

- dirleft to pos34 (dirleft direction? Let's check the problem's movement list for pos44.

Looking at the movement list:

"You may move from location pos44 to location pos34 following direction dirleft"

"You may move from location pos44 to location pos54 following direction dirright"

"You may move from location pos44 to location pos43 following direction dirup"

"You may move from location pos44 to location pos45 following direction dirdown"

So from pos44, dirleft is to pos34, dirright to pos54, dirup to pos43, dirdown to pos45.

So from pos45, moving dirup to pos44.

Then, from pos44, perhaps move dirup to pos43.

From pos43, the allowed moves:

"You may move from location pos43 to location pos33 following direction dirleft"

"You may move from location pos43 to location pos53 following direction dirright"

"You may move from location pos43 to location pos42 following direction dirup"

"You may move from location pos43 to location pos44 following direction dirdown"

So from pos43, moving dirup to pos42. But pos42 is a goal location. But the agent can move there if it's clear. The initial state says pos42 is clear (since in the original state, "Location pos42 is clear" is listed). So the agent can move to pos42. However, we need to check if that's allowed. Since pos42 is a goal location, but moving there is fine.

But our goal is to push the stone to a goal location. Since pos42 is a goal, pushing the stone there would satisfy the goal.

But the stone is at pos23. So the agent needs to reach pos23 to push the stone. Let's see.

Alternative path from pos45 to pos23:

pos45 -> pos35 (dirleft)

From pos35:

Movement options:

"You may move from location pos35 to location pos25 following direction dirleft"

"You may move from location pos35 to location pos45 following direction dirright"

"You may move from location pos35 to location pos34 following direction dirup"

So from pos35, moving dirup to pos34.

From pos34:

"You may move from location pos34 to location pos24 following direction dirleft"

"You may move from location pos34 to location pos44 following direction dirright"

"You may move from location pos34 to location pos33 following direction dirup"

"You may move from location pos34 to location pos35 following direction dirdown"

So from pos34, dirup to pos33.

From pos33:

Movement options:

"You may move from location pos33 to location pos23 following direction dirleft"

"You may move from location pos33 to location pos43 following direction dirright"

"You may move from location pos33 to location pos32 following direction dirup"

"You may move from location pos33 to location pos34 following direction dirdown"

So from pos33, dirleft to pos23. But pos23 is where the stone is. According to the initial state, pos23 is clear (even though the stone is there, which we're assuming is a mistake), but if the stone is there, then pos23 is not clear, so the agent can't move there. But according to the problem's initial state, pos23 is clear. So the agent can move there.

Wait, this is confusing. Assuming that the initial state is correct, even if contradictory, then pos23 is clear, so the agent can move there. So the agent can move from pos33 to pos23 via dirleft.

But once the agent is at pos23, they can push the stone. The stone is at pos23, so the agent needs to be adjacent to push it. Wait, no: the pushtogoal and pushtonongoal actions require the agent to be at l_p, the stone at l_from, and l_to is in direction d from l_from, and the agent can move from l_p to l_from via direction d. So for example, to push the stone from pos23 to pos24 (dirdown), the agent would need to be at pos22 (since from pos22, moving dirdown to pos23, then pushing to pos24. But pos22 must remain clear. So pushing from pos22 is impossible because pos22 must always be clear.

Alternatively, the agent can approach the stone from another direction. Let's see.

The stone is at pos23. The possible directions to push it:

From the problem's movement list for pos23:

"You may move from location pos23 to location pos13 following direction dirleft"

"You may move from location pos23 to location pos33 following direction dirright"

"You may move from location pos23 to location pos22 following direction dirup"

"You may move from location pos23 to location pos24 following direction dirdown"

So the stone can be pushed left (dirleft) to pos13, right (dirright) to pos33, up (dirup) to pos22, or down (dirdown) to pos24.

But pos22 must remain clear. So pushing the stone up to pos22 is not allowed. Therefore, the stone can't be moved to pos22. So the possible directions are left, right, or down.

The goal is to get the stone to a goal location. The only goal location is pos42. So the stone needs to be pushed from pos23 to pos33, then to pos43, then to pos42. Let's see the path.

But pos42 is a goal. So the path could be pos23 â†’ pos33 (right), then pos33 â†’ pos43 (right), then pos43 â†’ pos42 (up). However, pos43 to pos42 is up direction. Let's check the movement from pos43:

"You may move from location pos43 to location pos33 following direction dirleft"

"You may move from location pos43 to location pos53 following direction dirright"

"You may move from location pos43 to location pos42 following direction dirup"

"You may move from location pos43 to location pos44 following direction dirdown"

So from pos43, dirup to pos42.

So the agent can push the stone from pos43 to pos42 using pushtogoal, provided that the agent is at pos43's adjacent tile in the direction leading to pos43. Wait, the preconditions for pushtogoal are:

- agent is at l_p

- stone is at l_from

- l_to is clear

- agent can move from l_p to l_from via direction d (so l_p is adjacent to l_from in direction d)

- l_from to l_to via direction d (so l_to is adjacent to l_from in direction d)

So for example, to push the stone from pos43 to pos42 (dirup), the agent must be at pos43's direction d (dirup) leading to pos43. Wait, no. Let me clarify:

The action is "pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d". The preconditions are:

(i) agent p is at l_p

(ii) stone s is at l_from

(iii) l_to is clear

(iv) can get from l_p to l_from via d (so l_p is adjacent to l_from in direction d)

(v) can get from l_from to l_to via d (so l_to is adjacent to l_from in direction d)

(vi) l_to is a goal.

So to push from l_from to l_to (dirup), the agent must be at l_p which is adjacent to l_from in direction d. For example, if the stone is at pos43, and we want to push it to pos42 (dirup), then the agent must be at pos53 (since from pos53, moving dirup to pos43). Wait, no. Let's check the movement directions for pos53:

Looking at the movement list for pos53:

"You may move from location pos53 to location pos43 following direction dirleft"

"You may move from location pos53 to location pos52 following direction dirup"

"You may move from location pos53 to location pos54 following direction dirdown"

So to get to pos43 from pos53, direction dirleft. So if the agent is at pos53, they can move dirleft to pos43. Therefore, to push the stone from pos43 to pos42 (dirup), the agent must be at pos53, move dirleft to pos43 (l_p is pos53, l_from is pos43, l_to is pos42, d is dirup? Wait, no. The direction d in the push action is the direction from l_p to l_from, and from l_from to l_to.

Wait, for the action "pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d", the direction d must be such that from l_p, moving in direction d gets you to l_from, and from l_from, moving in direction d gets you to l_to.

So for example, if the stone is at pos43 (l_from), and the agent is at pos53 (l_p), then moving dirleft from pos53 gets to pos43. Then, from pos43, moving dirup gets to pos42. So direction d here would be dirleft for the first part, but the second part requires moving dirup. Wait, this is conflicting because the direction d must be the same for both movements (from l_p to l_from and from l_from to l_to). Therefore, this approach won't work.

Alternatively, the agent must be positioned such that moving in direction d from l_p reaches l_from, and moving in the same direction d from l_from reaches l_to.

So for the stone at pos43, to push it to pos42 (which is up from pos43), the agent must be at pos53 (south of pos43) and push upwards. But moving dirup from pos53 would go to pos52, not pos43. So that's not possible. Therefore, the agent needs to be north of pos43 to push it south, but pos42 is north of pos43. So to push the stone from pos43 to pos42 (dirup), the agent must be at pos43's north, which is pos42. But pos42 is a goal location, and initially clear. So the agent could move to pos42, then push the stone up from pos43 to pos42. Wait, but pos43 to pos42 is dirup. So the agent would be at pos42 (l_p), stone at pos43 (l_from), and push it to pos42? That's not possible because the stone is at pos43, and the agent is at pos42. To push the stone, the agent needs to be adjacent to the stone in the direction opposite to the push. For example, to push the stone north, the agent must be south of the stone. So in this case, to push the stone from pos43 to pos42 (dirup), the agent must be at pos53 (south of pos43) and move north (dirup) to pos43, pushing the stone north to pos42. But according to the movement directions, from pos53, moving dirup goes to pos52, not pos43. So this seems impossible.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let's step back. The stone is at pos23. The agent needs to push it to pos42. Let's plan the path for the stone:

pos23 â†’ pos24 (dirdown) â†’ pos34 (dirdown) â†’ pos44 (dirdown) â†’ pos54 (dirdown) â†’ then west to pos53, pos52, etc. But that's moving away. Alternatively, pos23 â†’ pos33 (dirright) â†’ pos43 (dirright) â†’ pos42 (dirup). But how to get the stone from pos43 to pos42.

Wait, pos43 to pos42 is possible via dirup, but the agent needs to be south of pos43 to push it north. So agent at pos53, moving north to pos43 (dirup), but according to the movement list, from pos53 moving dirup takes you to pos52. So that's not possible. Therefore, perhaps the agent can't push the stone from pos43 to pos42 directly. Alternatively, the agent needs to approach from the west.

Wait, pos43's movement options include dirleft to pos33, dirright to pos53, dirup to pos42, dirdown to pos44. So if the agent is at pos43's west (pos33), then pushing the stone east (dirright) to pos43's east (pos53), but that's not helpful. Alternatively, if the agent is at pos43's north (pos42), which is a goal, then pushing the stone south (dirdown) to pos44. But that's not helpful.

Alternatively, maybe the stone needs to go from pos23 â†’ pos33 â†’ pos34 â†’ pos44 â†’ pos54 â†’ pos55 â†’ ... but that's moving away from the goal.

This seems stuck. Maybe there's a different path. Let's consider pushing the stone from pos23 to pos24 (dirdown), then pos24 to pos34 (dirdown), then pos34 to pos44 (dirdown), then pos44 to pos54 (dirdown). Then from pos54, push west to pos53, pos52, etc., but pos42 is the goal. Hmm. Not helpful.

Alternatively, from pos23, push left to pos13, then up to pos12, etc. But that's moving away.

Wait, perhaps the only way is to push the stone to pos33, then to pos43, and then find a way to push it to pos42. Let's see.

After pushing the stone to pos33, the agent is at pos23 (if pushed from pos23 to pos33 via dirright). Wait, the pushtogoal or pushtonongoal action requires the agent to be at l_p, which is adjacent to l_from (the stone's current position) in direction d. For example, to push the stone from pos23 to pos33 (dirright), the agent must be at pos22 (since moving dirright from pos22 to pos23), but pos22 must remain clear. So that's impossible. Therefore, pushing the stone to pos33 from pos23 is not allowed because it would require the agent to be at pos22, which is forbidden.

Alternatively, the agent could approach the stone from the east. The stone is at pos23. To push it to pos24 (dirdown), the agent must be at pos22 (dirdown to pos23), but pos22 is forbidden. To push it to pos13 (dirleft), the agent must be at pos23's west, which is pos22 again. To push it to pos33 (dirright), the agent must be at pos23's east, which is pos24. So agent at pos24, moving dirleft to pos23, then pushing the stone to pos33 (dirright). So the action would be pushtonongoal (since pos33 is not a goal) with l_p=pos24, l_from=pos23, l_to=pos33, direction dirleft (from pos24 to pos23 is dirleft?), then from pos23 to pos33 is dirright.

Wait, the direction d must be the same for both moving from l_p to l_from and l_from to l_to. So if the agent is at pos24, and wants to push the stone from pos23 to pos33, the direction would have to be such that from pos24 to pos23 is direction d, and from pos23 to pos33 is direction d. Let's check the movement directions from pos24 to pos23 and pos23 to pos33.

From pos24, the movement options:

"You may move from location pos24 to location pos14 following direction dirleft"

"You may move from location pos24 to location pos34 following direction dirright"

"You may move from location pos24 to location pos23 following direction dirup"

"You may move from location pos24 to location pos25 following direction dirdown"

So from pos24 to pos23 is dirup. And from pos23 to pos33 is dirright. So the directions are different. Therefore, the same direction d can't be used for both movements. Therefore, this approach won't work.

This seems like a dead end. Maybe another approach: The agent needs to get to pos32, which is adjacent to pos33. Wait, but pos32 is connected to pos22, which is forbidden. Let's think differently.

Alternative plan: The agent moves to pos42 first (satisfying constraint 2 if pos42 is not clear later), then pushes the stone from pos23 to pos24, but that requires being at pos24. Let's see.

Agent's path from pos45 to pos42:

pos45 â†’ pos44 (dirup)

pos44 â†’ pos43 (dirup)

pos43 â†’ pos42 (dirup)

So three moves: move player1 pos45 pos44 dirup, move player1 pos44 pos43 dirup, move player1 pos43 pos42 dirup.

Now the agent is at pos42. This satisfies constraint 6 if during this path the agent is at pos31, but pos31 is not on this path. So maybe that's not helping. Alternatively, pushing the stone to pos33 would satisfy constraint 5 or 6.

But back to the plan. Once the agent is at pos42, which is a goal location, but the stone is still at pos23. The agent needs to get back to the stone. But pos42 is clear now (since the agent is there, so it's not clear anymore). Then, the agent can move from pos42 to pos43 (dirdown?), let's check movement from pos42:

"You may move from location pos42 to location pos32 following direction dirleft"

"You may move from location pos42 to location pos52 following direction dirright"

"You may move from location pos42 to location pos41 following direction dirup"

"You may move from location pos42 to location pos43 following direction dirdown"

So from pos42, the agent can move dirdown to pos43.

Then from pos43, move dirdown to pos44, etc., to reach pos23. But this seems inefficient.

Alternatively, once the agent is at pos42, maybe they can push the stone from pos23 via a series of moves. But the stone is at pos23, and the agent is at pos42. The distance is too great. So the agent needs to return to the stone's area.

Alternatively, maybe after reaching pos42, the agent can move west to pos32, then north to pos22, but pos22 must remain clear. So that's not allowed.

This approach doesn't seem effective. Let's consider another path.

Another way: The agent moves from pos45 to pos35 (dirleft), then to pos34 (dirup), then to pos33 (dirup), then to pos23 (dirleft). But when moving to pos23, the stone is there. Assuming that pos23 is clear (as per the initial state's conflicting info), the agent can move there. Once there, they can push the stone.

But if the stone is at pos23 and the agent moves there, that's impossible because a location can't have both. Therefore, the initial state must be incorrect, but we have to work with it. Assuming pos23 is clear (agent can move there), then the agent can move to pos23, but then the stone is there. This is a contradiction. So perhaps the stone is not at pos23, but that's what the problem states. This is a major issue.

Given the time I've spent and the confusion, perhaps I should proceed with an example plan that tries to satisfy all constraints, assuming that the initial state is correct despite the contradiction.

Alternative plan:

1. Move the agent from pos45 to pos44 (dirup).

2. Move to pos43 (dirup).

3. Move to pos33 (dirleft).

4. Move to pos23 (dirleft). But pos23 has the stone, so this is impossible. Unless the initial state is wrong.

Alternative approach: Use the pushtogoal action directly. But the agent needs to be adjacent to the stone. Given the constraints, especially pos22 must remain clear, the agent cannot approach from pos22.

The only way is to approach the stone from pos24 or pos33. Let's try to get the agent to pos24.

Path to pos24:

pos45 â†’ pos44 (dirup)

pos44 â†’ pos34 (dirleft)

pos34 â†’ pos24 (dirleft)

Now agent is at pos24. From here, can they push the stone from pos23 to pos24 (dirdown)?

But pos24 is not a goal location, so pushtonongoal would be used. But pushing the stone to pos24 would make pos24 not clear, which violates the constraint that pos24 can be non-clear in at most one continuous sequence. Also, the goal is to get the stone to pos42. So this isn't helpful.

Alternatively, from pos24, the agent can move to pos23 (dirup), but pos23 has the stone. So can't move there.

This is very challenging. Let's consider that the stone must be pushed to pos42. The only way is to move it through pos33, pos43, then pos42. But how?

Assuming the agent can reach pos33:

Agent path:

pos45 â†’ pos35 (dirleft)

pos35 â†’ pos34 (dirup)

pos34 â†’ pos33 (dirup)

Now agent is at pos33. From here, can they push the stone from pos23 to pos33 (dirright)? But the stone is at pos23. To push it to pos33 (dirright), the agent must be at pos23's west (pos22) which is forbidden, or east (pos24). Let's see:

Agent is at pos33. To push the stone from pos23 to pos33, the agent must be east of pos23 (pos24), moving west (dirleft) to pos23, then pushing it west (dirleft) to pos13, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, the agent is at pos33, which is east of pos23. Wait, pos23 is at (2,3), pos33 is (3,3). So the agent is south of pos23. To push north, the agent must be south of the stone.

Wait, directions are confusing. If the agent is at pos33 (3,3), and the stone is at pos23 (2,3), then the agent is south of the stone. To push the stone north (dirup), the agent would move north to pos23, pushing the stone to pos13. But pos13 is not a goal. Alternatively, pushing east.

Wait, the movement from pos23 to pos33 is dirright. So to push the stone from pos23 to pos33 (dirright), the agent must be west of pos23 (pos22), which is forbidden, or east of pos23 (pos24), moving west to pos23, then pushing east. But pos24 is allowed. Let's try:

Agent path to pos24:

pos45 â†’ pos44 (dirup)

pos44 â†’ pos34 (dirleft)

pos34 â†’ pos24 (dirleft)

Now agent is at pos24. From here, they can move dirup to pos23. But the stone is there. So can't move. Therefore, can't push from pos24 to pos23.

This is really tricky. Maybe the problem is designed such that the only way is to push the stone to pos42 via a certain path, and during that path, the constraints are satisfied.

Another idea: The agent moves to pos32, which is adjacent to pos42. But pos32 is connected to pos22, which is off-limits.

Alternatively, the agent moves to pos42 early on, satisfying constraint 2 if pos42 becomes not clear later. Then, the agent moves from pos42 to pos32, then to pos33, then to pos23. But pos32 to pos33 is allowed.

Agent path:

pos45 â†’ pos44 (dirup)

pos44 â†’ pos43 (dirup)

pos43 â†’ pos42 (dirup) â†’ now at pos42.

Then, from pos42, move dirdown to pos43.

pos43 â†’ pos33 (dirleft)

pos33 â†’ pos23 (dirleft)

But again, pos23 has the stone, so agent can't move there.

This seems impossible. I must be missing something.

Wait, perhaps the key is to use the pushtogoal action when the stone is at pos43, pushing it to pos42. To do that, the agent needs to be south of pos43 (pos53), move north (dirup) to pos43, then push north to pos42. But according to the movement list, from pos53, moving dirup goes to pos52, not pos43. So that's not possible.

Alternative approach: The agent moves to pos53, then dirleft to pos43. Then, from pos43, push the stone to pos42 (dirup). But how does the agent get to pos53?

Agent path:

pos45 â†’ pos55 (dirright)

pos55 â†’ pos54 (dirup)

pos54 â†’ pos53 (dirup)

pos53 â†’ pos43 (dirleft)

Now agent is at pos43. The stone is at pos23. This doesn't help.

Alternatively, the stone needs to be moved to pos43 first. But how?

This is getting too time-consuming. Given the time I've spent, perhaps the optimal plan is as follows, considering the constraints:

1. Move the agent from pos45 to pos35 (dirleft)

2. Move to pos34 (dirup)

3. Move to pos33 (dirup)

4. Move to pos23 (dirleft) â†’ but if pos23 is clear (as per initial state), this is possible. Then, the agent is at pos23, which now makes pos23 not clear.

5. Push the stone from pos23 to pos24 (dirdown) using pushtonongoal. But pos24 is not a goal. However, this would require the agent to be at pos23's north (pos22), which is forbidden. So this is invalid.

Alternative plan: Use the fact that pos42 is a goal. The agent moves to pos42, making pos42 not clear (satisfying constraint 1). Then, according to constraint 2, there must be an earlier state where either stone1 is at pos44 or player is at pos42. Since the agent moves to pos42, that earlier state is when the agent is at pos42. So constraint 2 is satisfied.

Then, the agent needs to push the stone to pos42. But how? The stone is at pos23. The agent is at pos42. The distance is too great. So perhaps the agent needs to loop back.

But given the time, I'll propose a plan that moves the agent to pos42, satisfying constraint 1 and 2, then somehow pushes the stone there. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, the constraints can be satisfied in other ways.

Another approach: The agent moves to pos31, satisfying constraint 6. Then proceeds to push the stone.

Path to pos31:

pos45 â†’ pos35 (dirleft)

pos35 â†’ pos34 (dirup)

pos34 â†’ pos33 (dirup)

pos33 â†’ pos32 (dirup)

pos32 â†’ pos22 (dirup) â†’ forbidden.

No, can't go to pos22. Alternative path:

pos45 â†’ pos44 (dirup)

pos44 â†’ pos34 (dirleft)

pos34 â†’ pos24 (dirleft)

pos24 â†’ pos14 (dirleft)

pos14 â†’ pos13 (dirup)

pos13 â†’ pos12 (dirup)

pos12 â†’ pos11 (dirup)

pos11 â†’ pos21 (dirright)

pos21 â†’ pos31 (dirright)

Now agent is at pos31, satisfying constraint 6. Then, the agent can move to pos32 (dirdown), then pos33 (dirdown), then pos23 (dirleft). But again, the stone is at pos23.

This is very time-consuming, and I'm not sure about the optimal path. Given the time, I'll propose a plan that satisfies the constraints and gets the stone to pos42.
