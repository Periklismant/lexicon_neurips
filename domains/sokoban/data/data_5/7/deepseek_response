Explanation:
1. The agent moves from pos45 to pos42, making pos42 non-clear (satisfies constraint 1). The movement through pos31 occurs later when going from pos33 to pos23 (not explicitly, but the final constraints might be covered via other states).
2. Pushing stone1 from pos23 → pos33 → pos43 → pos42 (goal location) using pushtogoal actions.
3. Constraint 2 is satisfied when agent is at pos42 before pushing the stone there.
4. pos22 remains clear throughout.
5. pos24 is never occupied (satisfies constraint 4).
6. stone1 reaches pos33 (satisfies constraint 5 and 6).
