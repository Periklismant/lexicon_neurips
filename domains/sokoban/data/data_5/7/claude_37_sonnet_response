Alright, let's break down this problem step by step. I'm given a 2D grid world where I need to move an agent (player1) to push a stone (stone1) into a goal position.

There are three types of actions:
1. "move p l_from l_to d": Move the agent from one location to another in a given direction.
2. "pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": Push a stone to a goal location.
3. "pushtonongoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": Push a stone to a non-goal location.

Let's first understand the initial state:
- player1 is at pos45.
- stone1 is at pos23.
- pos42 is a goal location.

The goal is to have stone1 at a goal location, which is pos42 (the only goal location in the grid).

Before I start planning, let's understand the constraints:
1. The location pos42 must not be clear at some point.
2. If pos42 is not clear, then earlier in the plan, either stone1 was at pos44 or player1 was at pos42.
3. Location pos22 must always be clear.
4. Location pos24 can only be not clear in a single continuous sequence of states.
5. At some point, either pos11 is not clear or stone1 is at pos33.
6. At some point, either player1 is at pos31 or stone1 is at pos33.

Let's try to understand what these constraints mean for our plan:
- Constraint 1 and 2 suggest that pos42 must be occupied at some point, and before that, either stone1 was at pos44 or player1 was at pos42. Since our goal is to move stone1 to a goal location (pos42), we'll definitely satisfy constraint 1 by having stone1 at pos42. For constraint 2, we might need to ensure that either stone1 passes through pos44 or player1 passes through pos42 on the way.
- Constraint 3 means we can't ever have the agent or the stone at pos22. We need to make sure our plan respects this.
- Constraint 4 means that pos24 can only be occupied once in a continuous sequence. For example, if the agent or stone moves to pos24, it stays there for a while, and then moves out, it can't go back to pos24.
- Constraints 5 and 6 suggest that at some point, we might need to have stone1 at pos33 to satisfy both.

Now, let's think about how to get stone1 from pos23 to pos42. Let's first visualize the grid:

```
pos11 pos12 pos13 pos14 pos15
pos21 pos22 pos23 pos24 pos25
pos31 pos32 pos33 pos34 pos35
pos41 pos42 pos43 pos44 pos45
pos51 pos52 pos53 pos54 pos55
```

Stone1 is at pos23 and player1 is at pos45. The goal is to get stone1 to pos42. 

The idea would be:
1. Player1 needs to get behind stone1 (pos23) to push it.
2. Player1 will push stone1 along a path to pos42.

Let's try to plan this out:

1. Player1 moves from pos45 to pos35 (move player1 pos45 pos35 dirleft)
2. Player1 moves from pos35 to pos34 (move player1 pos35 pos34 dirup)
3. Player1 moves from pos34 to pos33 (move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup)
4. Player1 moves from pos33 to pos32 (move player1 pos33 pos32 dirup)
5. player1 moves from pos32 to pos22 (move player1 pos32 pos22 dirleft)
6. player1 moves from pos22 to pos23 (move player1 pos22 pos23 dirdown)
7. player1 is at pos23, and stone1 is at pos23. We want to push it to pos33. But, there's an issue here. We can't push from the current position.

I think I got confused with the initial state. Let's double-check it:
- player1 is at pos45.
- stone1 is at pos23.

So, player1 is at the bottom-right corner, and stone1 is in the upper-middle part of the grid.

Let's adjust my approach:

1. Player1 moves from pos45 to pos35 (move player1 pos45 pos35 dirleft)
2. Player1 moves from pos35 to pos34 (move player1 pos35 pos34 dirup)
3. Player1 moves from pos34 to pos33 (move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup)
4. Player1 moves from pos33 to pos32 (move player1 pos33 pos32 dirup)
5. player1 moves from pos32 to pos22 (move player1 pos32 pos22 dirleft)
6. player1 moves from pos22 to pos12 (move player1 pos22 pos12 dirleft)
7. player1 moves from pos12 to pos13 (move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown)
8. player1 moves from pos13 to pos23 (move player1 pos13 pos23 dirright)

Now, player1 is at pos13 and stone1 is at pos23. This means player1 is above stone1. Player1 can push stone1 downwards.

9. Use "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos23 pos33 dirdown" to push stone1 to pos33.

This satisfies constraints 5 and 6, which require either pos11 to be not clear or stone1 to be at pos33, and either player1 to be at pos31 or stone1 to be at pos33.

Now, player1 is at pos23 and stone1 is at pos33.

To continue pushing stone1 to pos42, we need to move player1 to pos32 (to the left of stone1).

10. player1 moves from pos23 to pos22 (move player1 pos23 pos22 dirup)
11. player1 moves from pos22 to pos32 (move player1 pos22 pos32 dirright)

Now, player1 is at pos32 and can push stone1 to pos42 (goal location).

12. Use "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos33 pos43 dirdown" to push stone1 to pos43.

Now, player1 is at pos33 and stone1 is at pos43. To push stone1 to pos42, player1 needs to be at pos44 (to the right of pos43).

13. player1 moves from pos33 to pos34 (move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown)
14. player1 moves from pos34 to pos44 (move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright)

Now, player1 is at pos44 and stone1 is at pos43.

15. Use "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos43 pos42 dirleft" to push stone1 to pos42.

This should satisfy constraint 2, which requires that before pos42 is not clear, either stone1 was at pos44 or player1 was at pos42. 

Oh, it looks like I misunderstood constraint 2. It requires that if pos42 is not clear, then there was a state before where stone1 was at pos44 OR player1 was at pos42. But in my plan, stone1 goes from pos43 to pos42, not from pos44 to pos42. And player1 doesn't pass through pos42.

Let's rethink this. I'll have to find a path that either has stone1 passing through pos44 or player1 passing through pos42.

A potential path to get stone1 to pos42 can be: pos23 -> pos33 -> pos34 -> pos44 -> pos43 -> pos42.

Let's try this:

1. Player1 moves from pos45 to pos35 (move player1 pos45 pos35 dirleft)
2. Player1 moves from pos35 to pos34 (move player1 pos35 pos34 dirup)
3. Player1 moves from pos34 to pos33 (move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup)
4. Player1 moves from pos33 to pos32 (move player1 pos33 pos32 dirup)
5. player1 moves from pos32 to pos22 (move player1 pos32 pos22 dirleft)
6. player1 moves from pos22 to pos12 (move player1 pos22 pos12 dirleft)
7. player1 moves from pos12 to pos13 (move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown)
8. player1 moves from pos13 to pos23 (move player1 pos13 pos23 dirright)
9. Use "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos23 pos33 dirdown" to push stone1 to pos33.
10. player1 moves from pos23 to pos24 (move player1 pos23 pos24 dirdown)
11. player1 moves from pos24 to pos34 (move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright)
12. Use "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos33 pos34 dirdown" to push stone1 to pos34.
13. player1 moves from pos33 to pos32 (move player1 pos33 pos32 dirup)
14. player1 moves from pos32 to pos42 (move player1 pos32 pos42 dirright)
15. player1 moves from pos42 to pos43 (move player1 pos42 pos43 dirdown)
16. player1 moves from pos43 to pos44 (move player1 pos43 pos44 dirdown)
17. Use "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos34 pos44 dirdown" to push stone1 to pos44.
18. player1 moves from pos34 to pos33 (move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup)
19. player1 moves from pos33 to pos43 (move player1 pos33 pos43 dirright)
20. Use "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos44 pos43 dirleft" to push stone1 to pos43.
21. player1 moves from pos44 to pos42 (move player1 pos44 pos42 dirleft)
22. Use "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos43 pos42 dirleft" to push stone1 to pos42.

Ah, there's a problem again. I keep misunderstanding the rules. Let's look at the action "pushtogoal" and "pushtonongoal" again. 

For "pushtogoal", the preconditions are:
(i) agent p is at location l_p, (ii) stone s is at location l_from, (iii) location l_to is clear, (iv) you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d, (v) you can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d, and (vi) location l_to is a goal location.

So, for "pushtogoal", the agent needs to be adjacent to the stone, and the agent pushes the stone in the direction d.

Similarly, for "pushtonongoal", the agent needs to be adjacent to the stone and pushes it in the direction d.

Let me redraw the grid for clarity and plan again, considering direction:

```
pos11 pos12 pos13 pos14 pos15
pos21 pos22 pos23 pos24 pos25
pos31 pos32 pos33 pos34 pos35
pos41 pos42 pos43 pos44 pos45
pos51 pos52 pos53 pos54 pos55
```

Given:
- player1 is at pos45.
- stone1 is at pos23.
- pos42 is a goal location.

Let's plan again:

1. Player1 moves from pos45 to pos35 (move player1 pos45 pos35 dirleft)
2. Player1 moves from pos35 to pos25 (move player1 pos35 pos25 dirleft)
3. Player1 moves from pos25 to pos24 (move player1 pos25 pos24 dirup)
4. Player1 moves from pos24 to pos23 (move player1 pos24 pos23 dirleft)

So I'm at pos23, and stone1 is at pos23. This isn't right; let's revisit the initial state.

"player1 is at location pos45"
"stone1 is at location pos23"

Now, how do I understand "Location pos23 is clear" when it also says "stone1 is at location pos23"? This looks inconsistent.

Actually, I believe the issue is that the state "Location pos23 is clear" is redundant or inconsistent with "stone1 is at location pos23". If stone1 is at pos23, then pos23 is not clear.

Given the description of the actions, I'm leaning towards the interpretation that stone1 is indeed at pos23.

Now, to push stone1, player1 needs to be adjacent to it. Let's map out a plan:

1. Player1 moves from pos45 to pos35 (move player1 pos45 pos35 dirleft)
2. Player1 moves from pos35 to pos25 (move player1 pos35 pos25 dirleft)
3. Player1 moves from pos25 to pos24 (move player1 pos25 pos24 dirup)

Now, player1 is at pos24, which is to the right of stone1 (at pos23). Player1 can push stone1 to the left to pos13.

4. Use "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos23 pos13 dirleft" to push stone1 to pos13.

Now, player1 is at pos23 and stone1 is at pos13. If I want to get stone1 to pos42, I'd need to push it downwards, then right. Let's plan the next steps:

5. player1 moves from pos23 to pos22 (move player1 pos23 pos22 dirleft)
6. player1 moves from pos22 to pos12 (move player1 pos22 pos12 dirleft)
7. Use "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos12 pos13 pos23 dirdown" to push stone1 to pos23.

Hm, it looks like we're going in circles. Let me think differently.

From the initial position, I want to get stone1 to pos42. One path could be: pos23 -> pos33 -> pos43 -> pos42. Let's try planning along that path:

1. Player1 moves from pos45 to pos35 (move player1 pos45 pos35 dirleft)
2. Player1 moves from pos35 to pos34 (move player1 pos35 pos34 dirup)
3. Player1 moves from pos34 to pos33 (move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup)
4. Player1 moves from pos33 to pos32 (move player1 pos33 pos32 dirup)
5. Player1 moves from pos32 to pos22 (move player1 pos32 pos22 dirleft)
6. Player1 moves from pos22 to pos12 (move player1 pos22 pos12 dirleft)
7. Player1 moves from pos12 to pos13 (move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown)

I need to push stone1 that is at pos23. To do that, I need player1 to be adjacent to it. Player1 is at pos13, which is above stone1. Now, I need to be clear on the direction. When I push, is the direction from my perspective or from the stone's perspective?

Based on the action description, it looks like I just provide the direction I want the stone to move in. So, I want to push stone1 down from pos23 to pos33.

8. Use "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos23 pos33 dirdown" to push stone1 to pos33.

Now, player1 is at pos23 and stone1 is at pos33. I want to push stone1 further down to pos43.

9. Player1 moves from pos23 to pos32 (move player1 pos23 pos32 dirright)
10. Player1 moves from pos32 to pos33 (move player1 pos32 pos33 dirdown)
11. Player1 moves from pos33 to pos43 (move player1 pos33 pos43 dirdown)
12. Use "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos43 pos53 dirdown" to push stone1 to pos53.

Wait, no, I made a mistake. According to the preconditions of the push actions, I need to be adjacent to the stone to push it. Player1 is at pos23 and stone1 is at pos33. Player1 needs to move down to be adjacent to it.

9. player1 moves from pos23 to pos33 (move player1 pos23 pos33 dirdown)

But now player1 is at the same position as stone1, which doesn't make sense. Let me trace back and make sure I've understood the positions correctly.

Initial position: player1 is at pos45, stone1 is at pos23.

I move player1 from pos45 to pos13 (through pos35, pos34, pos33, pos32, pos22, pos12). Player1 is at pos13, which is adjacent to stone1 at pos23. I need to push stone1 down to pos33.

8. Use "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos23 pos33 dirdown" to push stone1 to pos33.

Ah, I made an error in my understanding of the push action. Let me review the action again.

For "pushtonongoal p s l_p l_from l_to d":
- p: agent (player1)
- s: stone (stone1)
- l_p: player's location (pos13)
- l_from: stone's current location (pos23)
- l_to: stone's destination (pos33)
- d: direction (dirdown)

So the action would be: "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos23 pos33 dirdown". After this action, player1 would be at pos23, and stone1 would be at pos33.

Let's continue with the plan:

9. Player1 moves from pos23 to pos33 (move player1 pos23 pos33 dirdown)

Now, player1 is at pos33 and stone1 is at pos33. This doesn't make sense. The stone and player can't occupy the same position. Let me trace back again.

Initial position: player1 is at pos45, stone1 is at pos23.

Let's understand the effects of the "pushtonongoal" action:
"pushtonongoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": After performing this action, (i) agent p is no longer at location l_p, (ii) stone s is no longer at location l_from, (iii) location l_to is no longer clear, (iv) agent p is at location l_from, (v) stone s is at location l_to, (vi) location l_p is clear, and (vi) stone s is at a non goal state.

So, after "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos23 pos33 dirdown", player1 is at pos23 (not at pos13 anymore) and stone1 is at pos33 (not at pos23 anymore).

Player1 is already adjacent to stone1. But since we just pushed, I need to move player1 to a position adjacent to stone1 again to push it further.

9. Player1 moves from pos23 to pos24 (move player1 pos23 pos24 dirdown)
10. Player1 moves from pos24 to pos34 (move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright)

Now, player1 is at pos34, which is to the right of stone1 (at pos33). I want to push stone1 to the left, towards pos42.

11. Use "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos33 pos32 dirleft" to push stone1 to pos32.

Now, player1 is at pos33 and stone1 is at pos32. The next step is to push stone1 to pos42.

12. Player1 moves from pos33 to pos32 (move player1 pos33 pos32 dirleft)
13. Player1 moves from pos32 to pos42 (move player1 pos32 pos42 dirdown)

Now, player1 is at pos42 and stone1 is at pos32. Player1 needs to go above stone1 to push it down to pos42.

14. Player1 moves from pos42 to pos32 (move player1 pos42 pos32 dirup)
15. Player1 moves from pos32 to pos31 (move player1 pos32 pos31 dirleft)
16. Player1 moves from pos31 to pos21 (move player1 pos31 pos21 dirleft)
17. Player1 moves from pos21 to pos22 (move player1 pos21 pos22 dirdown)

Now, player1 is at pos22, which is to the left of stone1 (at pos32). I want to push stone1 to the right to pos42.

18. Use "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos32 pos42 dirright" to push stone1 to pos42.

With this action, stone1 is at the goal location pos42, and player1 is at pos32. We've achieved the goal.

Let's review the plan to ensure it meets all the constraints:

1. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'Location pos42 is not clear'": This constraint is satisfied because stone1 will be at pos42 in the final state.

2. "If 'Location pos42 is not clear' holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which 'At least one of the following conditions is true: "stone1 is at location pos44", "player1 is at location pos42"'": This constraint requires that before stone1 is at pos42, either stone1 was at pos44 or player1 was at pos42. In our plan, player1 is at pos42 in step 13, and stone1 is moved to pos42 in step 18. So, this constraint is satisfied.

3. "The following expression must hold in every state: 'Location pos22 is clear'": In our plan, player1 is at pos22 in step 6 and step 17. Stone1 is never at pos22. This constraint is violated. Let me rethink the plan.

Alright, let me revise the plan to avoid having player1 or stone1 at pos22:

1. Player1 moves from pos45 to pos35 (move player1 pos45 pos35 dirleft)
2. Player1 moves from pos35 to pos34 (move player1 pos35 pos34 dirup)
3. Player1 moves from pos34 to pos33 (move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup)
4. Player1 moves from pos33 to pos23 (move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft)

Now, player1 is at pos23 and stone1 is at pos23. This isn't right again. Let me revisit the initial state to clarify:

"player1 is at location pos45"
"stone1 is at location pos23"

given the redundant "Location pos23 is clear", I think the intent is that both player1 and stone1 are separate entities and can't occupy the same location. So, in the initial state, I have player1 at pos45 and stone1 at pos23.

Let's revise the plan. I want to push stone1 from pos23 to pos42. Here's a new plan:

1. Player1 moves from pos45 to pos35 (move player1 pos45 pos35 dirleft)
2. Player1 moves from pos35 to pos34 (move player1 pos35 pos34 dirup)
3. Player1 moves from pos34 to pos33 (move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup)
4. Player1 moves from pos33 to pos32 (move player1 pos33 pos32 dirup)
5. Player1 moves from pos32 to pos31 (move player1 pos32 pos31 dirleft)
6. Player1 moves from pos31 to pos21 (move player1 pos31 pos21 dirleft)

Now, player1 is at pos21, which is to the left of stone1 (at pos23). Player1 can push stone1 to the right to pos24.

7. Use "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos21 pos23 pos24 dirright" to push stone1 to pos24.

Now, player1 is at pos23 and stone1 is at pos24.

8. Player1 moves from pos23 to pos24 (move player1 pos23 pos24 dirright)
9. Player1 moves from pos24 to pos34 (move player1 pos24 pos34 dirdown)

Now, player1 is at pos34, which is below stone1 (at pos24). Player1 can push stone1 upwards to pos14.

10. Use "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos24 pos14 dirup" to push stone1 to pos14.

Now, player1 is at pos24 and stone1 is at pos14.

11. Player1 moves from pos24 to pos25 (move player1 pos24 pos25 dirright)
12. Player1 moves from pos25 to pos15 (move player1 pos25 pos15 dirleft)

Now, player1 is at pos15, which is to the right of stone1 (at pos14). Player1 can push stone1 to the left to pos13.

13. Use "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos15 pos14 pos13 dirleft" to push stone1 to pos13.

Now, player1 is at pos14 and stone1 is at pos13.

14. Player1 moves from pos14 to pos13 (move player1 pos14 pos13 dirleft)
15. Player1 moves from pos13 to pos23 (move player1 pos13 pos23 dirdown)

Now, player1 is at pos23, which is below stone1 (at pos13). Player1 can push stone1 downwards to pos23.

16. Use "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos13 pos23 dirdown" to push stone1 to pos23.

Now, player1 is at pos13 and stone1 is at pos23.

17. Player1 moves from pos13 to pos23 (move player1 pos13 pos23 dirdown)
18. Player1 moves from pos23 to pos33 (move player1 pos23 pos33 dirdown)

Now, player1 is at pos33, which is below stone1 (at pos23). Player1 can push stone1 downwards to pos33.

19. Use "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos23 pos33 dirdown" to push stone1 to pos33.

Hmm, we're going in circles again.

I'm trying to understand if I have misunderstood the problem again. Let's revisit the format of the actions:

"move p l_from l_to d": Move agent p from location l_from to location l_to following direction d.
"pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": Make agent p, situated at location l_p, push stone s from location l_from to goal location l_to, following direction d.
"pushtonongoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": Make agent p, situated at location l_p, push stone s from location l_from to non-goal location l_to, following direction d.

For the push actions, agent p is at location l_p, and stone s is at location l_from. They're different, which aligns with the understanding that they can't occupy the same location.

I still don't understand what the redundant "Location pos23 is clear" means given that stone1 is at pos23. But I'll continue with the understanding that player1 and stone1 can't share a location.

Let's revisit the position again. Stone1 is at pos23. To push stone1 to pos33, player1 needs to be at pos13, which is above stone1. Player1 is starting from pos45. Here's the revised plan:

1. Player1 moves from pos45 to pos35 (move player1 pos45 pos35 dirleft)
2. Player1 moves from pos35 to pos25 (move player1 pos35 pos25 dirleft)
3. Player1 moves from pos25 to pos15 (move player1 pos25 pos15 dirleft)
4. Player1 moves from pos15 to pos14 (move player1 pos15 pos14 dirleft)
5. Player1 moves from pos14 to pos13 (move player1 pos14 pos13 dirleft)

Now, player1 is at pos13, which is above stone1 (at pos23). Player1 can push stone1 downwards to pos33.

6. Use "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos23 pos33 dirdown" to push stone1 to pos33.

Now, player1 is at pos23 and stone1 is at pos33. This satisfies constraint 5 and 6, which require stone1 to be at pos33 at some point.

7. Player1 moves from pos23 to pos33 (move player1 pos23 pos33 dirdown)
8. Player1 moves from pos33 to pos43 (move player1 pos33 pos43 dirdown)

Now, player1 is at pos43, which is below stone1 (at pos33). Player1 can push stone1 downwards to pos43.

9. Use "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos33 pos43 dirdown" to push stone1 to pos43.

Now, player1 is at pos33 and stone1 is at pos43.

10. Player1 moves from pos33 to pos32 (move player1 pos33 pos32 dirleft)
11. Player1 moves from pos32 to pos42 (move player1 pos32 pos42 dirdown)

Now, player1 is at pos42, which is to the left of stone1 (at pos43). Player1 can push stone1 to the left to pos42, which is the goal position. This also satisfies constraint 2, which requires player1 to be at pos42 before stone1 is at pos42.

12. Use "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos43 pos42 dirleft" to push stone1 to pos42.

Now, player1 is at pos43 and stone1 is at pos42, which is the goal!

Let's review the plan to ensure it meets all the constraints:

1. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'Location pos42 is not clear'": This constraint is satisfied because stone1 will be at pos42 in the final state.

2. "If 'Location pos42 is not clear' holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which 'At least one of the following conditions is true: "stone1 is at location pos44", "player1 is at location pos42"'": This constraint is satisfied because player1 is at pos42 in step 11, and stone1 is moved to pos42 in step 12.

3. "The following expression must hold in every state: 'Location pos22 is clear'": In our plan, neither player1 nor stone1 is ever at pos22. This constraint is satisfied.

4. "The following expression must hold in at most one continuous sequence of states: 'Location pos24 is not clear'": In our plan, neither player1 nor stone1 is ever at pos24. This constraint is satisfied.

5. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'At least one of the following conditions is true: "Location pos11 is not clear", "stone1 is at location pos33"'": This constraint is satisfied because stone1 is at pos33 after step 6.

6. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'At least one of the following conditions is true: "player1 is at location pos31", "stone1 is at location pos33"'": This constraint is satisfied because stone1 is at pos33 after step 6.

All constraints are satisfied. Here's the final plan:

1. move player1 pos45 pos35 dirleft
2. move player1 pos35 pos25 dirleft
3. move player1 pos25 pos15 dirleft
4. move player1 pos15 pos14 dirleft
5. move player1 pos14 pos13 dirleft
6. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos23 pos33 dirdown
7. move player1 pos23 pos33 dirdown
8. move player1 pos33 pos43 dirdown
9. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos33 pos43 dirdown
10. move player1 pos33 pos32 dirleft
11. move player1 pos32 pos42 dirdown
12. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos43 pos42 dirleft

My bad, there's an error in the plan. In step 9, player1 is at pos43 and is trying to push stone1 from pos33 to pos43. But the agent needs to be adjacent to the stone to push it, not at the same location as the destination. Let me correct this:

7. Player1 moves from pos23 to pos24 (move player1 pos23 pos24 dirright)
8. Player1 moves from pos24 to pos34 (move player1 pos24 pos34 dirdown)

Now, player1 is at pos34, which is to the right of stone1 (at pos33). Player1 can push stone1 to the left to pos32.

9. Use "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos33 pos32 dirleft" to push stone1 to pos32.

Now, player1 is at pos33 and stone1 is at pos32.

10. Player1 moves from pos33 to pos32 (move player1 pos33 pos32 dirleft)
11. Player1 moves from pos32 to pos42 (move player1 pos32 pos42 dirdown)

Now, player1 is at pos42, which is below stone1 (at pos32). Player1 can push stone1 downwards to pos42, which is the goal position. This also satisfies constraint 2, which requires player1 to be at pos42 before stone1 is at pos42.

12. Use "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos42 dirup" to push stone1 to pos42.

Wait, I think I'm still getting confused with the directions. Let's be clear about the grid:

```
pos11 pos12 pos13 pos14 pos15
pos21 pos22 pos23 pos24 pos25
pos31 pos32 pos33 pos34 pos35
pos41 pos42 pos43 pos44 pos45
pos51 pos52 pos53 pos54 pos55
```

In this grid, rows increase downwards and columns increase to the right. So, to push a stone upwards (from a higher row to a lower row), the direction would be "dirup." To push a stone downwards (from a lower row to a higher row), the direction would be "dirdown." To push a stone to the right (from a lower column to a higher column), the direction would be "dirright." To push a stone to the left (from a higher column to a lower column), the direction would be "dirleft."

Let me rewrite the plan from step 10, with clearer directions:

10. Player1 moves from pos33 to pos32 (move player1 pos33 pos32 dirleft)
11. Player1 moves from pos32 to pos42 (move player1 pos32 pos42 dirdown)

Now, player1 is at pos42, which is below stone1 (at pos32). Player1 can push stone1 downwards to pos42, which is the goal position. This also satisfies constraint 2, which requires player1 to be at pos42 before stone1 is at pos42.

12. Use "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos42 dirup" to push stone1 to pos42.

Wait, there's something wrong with this. If player1 is at pos42 and stone1 is at pos32, player1 can't push stone1 downwards to pos42 because player1 isn't adjacent to stone1. Player1 would need to be at pos22 to push stone1 from pos32 to pos42, but that would violate constraint 3.

Let's reset and approach this differently:

1. Player1 moves from pos45 to pos35 (move player1 pos45 pos35 dirleft)
2. Player1 moves from pos35 to pos25 (move player1 pos35 pos25 dirleft)
3. Player1 moves from pos25 to pos15 (move player1 pos25 pos15 dirleft)
4. Player1 moves from pos15 to pos14 (move player1 pos15 pos14 dirleft)
5. Player1 moves from pos14 to pos13 (move player1 pos14 pos13 dirleft)

Now, player1 is at pos13, which is above stone1 (at pos23). Player1 can push stone1 downwards to pos33.

6. Use "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos23 pos33 dirdown" to push stone1 to pos33.

Now, player1 is at pos23 and stone1 is at pos33. This satisfies constraint 5 and 6, which require stone1 to be at pos33 at some point.

7. Player1 moves from pos23 to pos24 (move player1 pos23 pos24 dirright)
8. Player1 moves from pos24 to pos34 (move player1 pos24 pos34 dirdown)

Now, player1 is at pos34, which is to the right of stone1 (at pos33). Player1 can push stone1 to the left to pos23.

9. Use "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos33 pos23 dirleft" to push stone1 to pos23.

Now, player1 is at pos33 and stone1 is at pos23. Now I need player1 to get around and push stone1 to pos33 again (to reach pos43 and eventually pos42). I can't use the route through pos22 as it violates constraint 3.

10. Player1 moves from pos33 to pos34 (move player1 pos33 pos34 dirright)
11. Player1 moves from pos34 to pos24 (move player1 pos34 pos24 dirup)
12. Player1 moves from pos24 to pos14 (move player1 pos24 pos14 dirup)
13. Player1 moves from pos14 to pos13 (move player1 pos14 pos13 dirleft)

Now, player1 is at pos13, which is above stone1 (at pos23). Player1 can push stone1 downwards to pos33.

14. Use "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos23 pos33 dirdown" to push stone1 to pos33.

Actually, I need to revise this approach. I'm going around in circles without making progress towards the goal. Let's focus on moving stone1 from its initial position at pos23 directly to the goal at pos42. I need a clear path:

pos23 -> pos33 -> pos43 -> pos42

1. Player1 moves from pos45 to pos35 (move player1 pos45 pos35 dirleft)
2. Player1 moves from pos35 to pos25 (move player1 pos35 pos25 dirleft)
3. Player1 moves from pos25 to pos15 (move player1 pos25 pos15 dirleft)
4. Player1 moves from pos15 to pos14 (move player1 pos15 pos14 dirleft)
5. Player1 moves from pos14 to pos13 (move player1 pos14 pos13 dirleft)

Now, player1 is at pos13, which is above stone1 (at pos23). Player1 can push stone1 downwards to pos33.

6. Use "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos23 pos33 dirdown" to push stone1 to pos33.

Now, player1 is at pos23 and stone1 is at pos33.

7. Player1 moves from pos23 to pos24 (move player1 pos23 pos24 dirright)
8. Player1 moves from pos24 to pos34 (move player1 pos24 pos34 dirdown)

Now, player1 is at pos34, which is to the right of stone1 (at pos33). Player1 can push stone1 to the right (towards pos43).

9. Use "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos33 pos43 dirright" to push stone1 to pos43.

Oh, I made a mistake. Going from pos33 to pos43 would mean moving downwards (dirdown), not to the right (dirright). Let me correct:

9. Use "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos33 pos43 dirdown" to push stone1 to pos43.

Now, player1 is at pos33 and stone1 is at pos43.

10. Player1 moves from pos33 to pos43 (move player1 pos33 pos43 dirdown)
11. Player1 moves from pos43 to pos44 (move player1 pos43 pos44 dirright)

Now, player1 is at pos44, which is to the right of stone1 (at pos43). Player1 can push stone1 to the left to pos42, which is the goal position.

12. Use "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos43 pos42 dirleft" to push stone1 to pos42.

Now, player1 is at pos43 and stone1 is at pos42, which is the goal!

But we haven't satisfied constraint 2 yet, which requires player1 to be at pos42 or stone1 to be at pos44 before stone1 is at pos42. Let's revise the plan:

1. Player1 moves from pos45 to pos35 (move player1 pos45 pos35 dirleft)
2. Player1 moves from pos35 to pos25 (move player1 pos35 pos25 dirleft)
3. Player1 moves from pos25 to pos15 (move player1 pos25 pos15 dirleft)
4. Player1 moves from pos15 to pos14 (move player1 pos15 pos14 dirleft)
5. Player1 moves from pos14 to pos13 (move player1 pos14 pos13 dirleft)
6. Use "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos23 pos33 dirdown" to push stone1 to pos33.
7. Player1 moves from pos23 to pos24 (move player1 pos23 pos24 dirright)
8. Player1 moves from pos24 to pos34 (move player1 pos24 pos34 dirdown)
9. Use "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos33 pos43 dirdown" to push stone1 to pos43.
10. Player1 moves from pos33 to pos43 (move player1 pos33 pos43 dirdown)
11. Player1 moves from pos43 to pos44 (move player1 pos43 pos44 dirright)
12. Use "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos43 pos44 dirright" to push stone1 to pos44.

Now, player1 is at pos43 and stone1 is at pos44. This satisfies part of constraint 2.

13. Player1 moves from pos43 to pos42 (move player1 pos43 pos42 dirleft)

Now, player1 is at pos42, which satisfies the other part of constraint 2.

14. Player1 moves from pos42 to pos43 (move player1 pos42 pos43 dirright)
15. Player1 moves from pos43 to pos44 (move player1 pos43 pos44 dirright)
16. Player1 moves from pos44 to pos34 (move player1 pos44 pos34 dirup)
17. Player1 moves from pos34 to pos44 (move player1 pos34 pos44 dirdown)
18. Use "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos44 pos43 dirleft" to push stone1 to pos43.

Now, player1 is at pos44 and stone1 is at pos43.

19. Player1 moves from pos44 to pos43 (move player1 pos44 pos43 dirleft)
20. Player1 moves from pos43 to pos44 (move player1 pos43 pos44 dirright)
21. Use "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos43 pos42 dirleft" to push stone1 to pos42.

Now, player1 is at pos43 and stone1 is at pos42, which is the goal!

Let's review the plan to ensure it meets all the constraints:

1. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'Location pos42 is not clear'": This constraint is satisfied because player1 is at pos42 in step 13 and stone1 is at pos42 in the final state.

2. "If 'Location pos42 is not clear' holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which 'At least one of the following conditions is true: "stone1 is at location pos44", "player1 is at location pos42"'": This constraint is satisfied because player1 is at pos42 in step 13 and stone1 is at pos44 in step 12, and both occur before stone1 is at pos42 in step 21.

3. "The following expression must hold in every state: 'Location pos22 is clear'": In our plan, neither player1 nor stone1 is ever at pos22. This constraint is satisfied.

4. "The following expression must hold in at most one continuous sequence of states: 'Location pos24 is not clear'": In our plan, player1 is at pos24 in steps 7 and 12. These are two separate sequences, which violate the constraint. Let me revise the plan.

I was again confused about the interpretation of constraint 4. It says "Location pos24 is not clear" should hold in at most one continuous sequence of states. This means pos24 can be occupied once for a continuous sequence, but not more than once. If player1 or stone1 move to pos24, they can stay there for a while, but once they leave, they shouldn't go back to pos24.

Let me revise the plan to avoid going back to pos24 after leaving it:

1. Player1 moves from pos45 to pos35 (move player1 pos45 pos35 dirleft)
2. Player1 moves from pos35 to pos25 (move player1 pos35 pos25 dirleft)
3. Player1 moves from pos25 to pos15 (move player1 pos25 pos15 dirleft)
4. Player1 moves from pos15 to pos14 (move player1 pos15 pos14 dirleft)
5. Player1 moves from pos14 to pos13 (move player1 pos14 pos13 dirleft)
6. Use "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos23 pos33 dirdown" to push stone1 to pos33.
7. Player1 moves from pos23 to pos24 (move player1 pos23 pos24 dirright)
8. Player1 moves from pos24 to pos34 (move player1 pos24 pos34 dirdown)

Now, player1 is at pos34, which is to the right of stone1 (at pos33). Player1 can push stone1 downwards to pos43.

9. Use "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos33 pos43 dirdown" to push stone1 to pos43.

Now, player1 is at pos33 and stone1 is at pos43.

10. Player1 moves from pos33 to pos32 (move player1 pos33 pos32 dirleft)
11. Player1 moves from pos32 to pos31 (move player1 pos32 pos31 dirleft)

This satisfies constraint 6, which requires player1 to be at pos31 or stone1 to be at pos33 at some point.

12. Player1 moves from pos31 to pos41 (move player1 pos31 pos41 dirdown)
13. Player1 moves from pos41 to pos42 (move player1 pos41 pos42 dirright)

Now, player1 is at pos42, which satisfies part of constraint 2.

14. Player1 moves from pos42 to pos43 (move player1 pos42 pos43 dirright)
15. Player1 moves from pos43 to pos44 (move player1 pos43 pos44 dirright)

Now, player1 is at pos44 and stone1 is at pos43. Player1 can push stone1 to the right to pos44.

16. Use "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos43 pos44 dirright" to push stone1 to pos44.

Now, player1 is at pos43 and stone1 is at pos44. This satisfies the other part of constraint 2.

17. Player1 moves from pos43 to pos44 (move player1 pos43 pos44 dirright)
18. Player1 moves from pos44 to pos54 (move player1 pos44 pos54 dirdown)
19. Player1 moves from pos54 to pos53 (move player1 pos54 pos53 dirleft)
20. Player1 moves from pos53 to pos43 (move player1 pos53 pos43 dirup)

Now, player1 is at pos43 and stone1 is at pos44. Player1 can push stone1 to the left to pos43.

21. Use "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos44 pos43 dirleft" to push stone1 to pos43.

Now, player1 is at pos44 and stone1 is at pos43.

22. Player1 moves from pos44 to pos43 (move player1 pos44 pos43 dirleft)
23. Player1 moves from pos43 to pos42 (move player1 pos43 pos42 dirleft)

Now, player1 is at pos42 and stone1 is at pos43. Player1 can push stone1 to the left to pos42, which is the goal position.

24. Use "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos43 pos42 dirleft" to push stone1 to pos42.

Now, player1 is at pos43 and stone1 is at pos42, which is the goal!

Let's review the plan to ensure it meets all the constraints:

1. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'Location pos42 is not clear'": This constraint is satisfied because player1 is at pos42 in steps 13 and 23, and stone1 is at pos42 in the final state.

2. "If 'Location pos42 is not clear' holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which 'At least one of the following conditions is true: "stone1 is at location pos44", "player1 is at location pos42"'": This constraint is satisfied because player1 is at pos42 in steps 13 and 23, and stone1 is at pos44 in step 16, all of which occur before stone1 is at pos42 in step 24.

3. "The following expression must hold in every state: 'Location pos22 is clear'": In our plan, neither player1 nor stone1 is ever at pos22. This constraint is satisfied.

4. "The following expression must hold in at most one continuous sequence of states: 'Location pos24 is not clear'": In our plan, player1 is at pos24 only in step 7. After player1 leaves pos24, neither player1 nor stone1 returns to pos24. This constraint is satisfied.

5. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'At least one of the following conditions is true: "Location pos11 is not clear", "stone1 is at location pos33"'": This constraint is satisfied because stone1 is at pos33 after step 6.

6. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'At least one of the following conditions is true: "player1 is at location pos31", "stone1 is at location pos33"'": This constraint is satisfied because player1 is at pos31 in step 11 and stone1 is at pos33 after step 6.

All constraints are satisfied. Here's the final plan:

1. move player1 pos45 pos35 dirleft
2. move player1 pos35 pos25 dirleft
3. move player1 pos25 pos15 dirleft
4. move player1 pos15 pos14 dirleft
5. move player1 pos14 pos13 dirleft
6. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos23 pos33 dirdown
7. move player1 pos23 pos24 dirright
8. move player1 pos24 pos34 dirdown
9. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos33 pos43 dirdown
10. move player1 pos33 pos32 dirleft
11. move player1 pos32 pos31 dirleft
12. move player1 pos31 pos41 dirdown
13. move player1 pos41 pos42 dirright
14. move player1 pos42 pos43 dirright
15. move player1 pos43 pos44 dirright
16. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos43 pos44 dirright
17. move player1 pos43 pos44 dirright
18. move player1 pos44 pos54 dirdown
19. move player1 pos54 pos53 dirleft
20. move player1 pos53 pos43 dirup
21. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos44 pos43 dirleft
22. move player1 pos44 pos43 dirleft
23. move player1 pos43 pos42 dirleft
24. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos43 pos42 dirleft

Wait, there's a problem in step 17. If player1 is at pos43 and stone1 is at pos44, player1 can't move to pos44 because stone1 is already there.

Let me correct this:

17. Player1 moves from pos43 to pos53 (move player1 pos43 pos53 dirdown)
18. Player1 moves from pos53 to pos54 (move player1 pos53 pos54 dirright)
19. Player1 moves from pos54 to pos44 (move player1 pos54 pos44 dirup)

Now, player1 is at pos44 and stone1 is also at pos44. This isn't right. Let me trace back again.

Let me restate the problem:
- player1, initially at pos45, needs to move stone1, initially at pos23, to goal location pos42.
- The constraints mean that: pos22 has to always be clear, pos24 can only be occupied once, stone1 has to be at pos33 at some point, player1 has to be at pos31 at some point, stone1 has to be at pos44 or player1 has to be at pos42 before stone1 is at pos42, and pos42 has to be occupied at some point.

I was caught in the trap of thinking about getting stone1 to pos44. I can still move player1 to pos42 at some point. Here's a simplification to reduce the plan length:

1. move player1 pos45 pos35 dirleft
2. move player1 pos35 pos25 dirleft
3. move player1 pos25 pos15 dirleft
4. move player1 pos15 pos14 dirleft
5. move player1 pos14 pos13 dirleft
6. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos23 pos33 dirdown
7. move player1 pos23 pos24 dirright
8. move player1 pos24 pos34 dirdown
9. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos33 pos43 dirdown
10. move player1 pos33 pos32 dirleft
11. move player1 pos32 pos31 dirleft
12. move player1 pos31 pos41 dirdown
13. move player1 pos41 pos42 dirright

Now, player1 is at pos42 and stone1 is at pos43. This satisfies constraint 2, which requires player1 to be at pos42 before stone1 is at pos42.

14. Use "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos43 pos42 dirleft" to push stone1 to pos42.

Now, player1 is at pos43 and stone1 is at pos42, which is the goal!

Let's review the plan to ensure it meets all the constraints:

1. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'Location pos42 is not clear'": This constraint is satisfied because player1 is at pos42 in step 13 and stone1 is at pos42 in the final state.

2. "If 'Location pos42 is not clear' holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which 'At least one of the following conditions is true: "stone1 is at location pos44", "player1 is at location pos42"'": This constraint is satisfied because player1 is at pos42 in step 13, which occurs before stone1 is at pos42 in step 14.

3. "The following expression must hold in every state: 'Location pos22 is clear'": In our plan, neither player1 nor stone1 is ever at pos22. This constraint is satisfied.

4. "The following expression must hold in at most one continuous sequence of states: 'Location pos24 is not clear'": In our plan, player1 is at pos24 only in step 7. After player1 leaves pos24, neither player1 nor stone1 returns to pos24. This constraint is satisfied.

5. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'At least one of the following conditions is true: "Location pos11 is not clear", "stone1 is at location pos33"'": This constraint is satisfied because stone1 is at pos33 after step 6.

6. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'At least one of the following conditions is true: "player1 is at location pos31", "stone1 is at location pos33"'": This constraint is satisfied because player1 is at pos31 in step 11 and stone1 is at pos33 after step 6.

All constraints are satisfied. Here's the final, optimized plan (with 14 steps):

1. move player1 pos45 pos35 dirleft
2. move player1 pos35 pos25 dirleft
3. move player1 pos25 pos15 dirleft
4. move player1 pos15 pos14 dirleft
5. move player1 pos14 pos13 dirleft
6. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos23 pos33 dirdown
7. move player1 pos23 pos24 dirright
8. move player1 pos24 pos34 dirdown
9. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos33 pos43 dirdown
10. move player1 pos33 pos32 dirleft
11. move player1 pos32 pos31 dirleft
12. move player1 pos31 pos41 dirdown
13. move player1 pos41 pos42 dirright
14. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos43 pos42 dirleft
