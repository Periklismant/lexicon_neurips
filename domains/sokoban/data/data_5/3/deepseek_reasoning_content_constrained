Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. First, I need to understand the initial state, the goal, and the constraints. The main goal is to have stone1 at a goal location. The only goal location mentioned is pos34. So, stone1 is initially at pos42, and I need to get it to pos34.

The constraints are a bit tricky. Let me list them out:

1. pos53 must always be clear. So, no actions can result in the agent or a stone being at pos53.
2. At least once, pos15 must not be clear. So, either the agent or a stone must be there at some point.
3. The agent (player1) must never be at pos43. So, all actions that involve moving to pos43 are off-limits.
4. At least once, pos14 must not be clear. So, the agent or a stone must be there.
5. Stone1 must never be at pos43. So, pushing it there is forbidden.

Alright, starting with the initial positions. The agent is at pos12, stone1 is at pos42. We need to push stone1 from pos42 to pos34. Let's see the possible paths.

From pos42, the possible directions are left (to pos32), right (to pos52), up (to pos41), or down (to pos43). But pushing down to pos43 is not allowed because of constraint 5. So, the stone can't go to pos43. So, possible moves for the stone are left, right, or up. But to reach the goal pos34, which is in the third row (pos34 is row 3, column4). Wait, pos34 is in the 3rd row, 4th column. The stone is at pos42 (row4, column2). So, to get to pos34, the stone needs to move left and up. Let's map the grid:

Rows are 1 to 5 (top to bottom?), columns 1 to 5. So pos11 is top-left, pos55 is bottom-right. So pos34 is row3, column4. Stone1 is at pos42 (row4, column2). The goal is to move it to pos34.

Possible path: pos42 → pos32 (left), then pos32 → pos33 (down?), but directions are a bit confusing. Wait, the movement directions: for example, from pos42, moving left would be to pos32 (since pos42 is row4, column2; left would decrease column by 1 to column1? Wait, no. Wait, the movement directions are defined as "You may move from location pos42 to location pos32 following direction dirleft". So dirleft from pos42 goes to pos32. Similarly, dirright from pos42 goes to pos52. Dirup from pos42 goes to pos41, and dirdown to pos43 (but that's forbidden).

So to move the stone from pos42 towards pos34, the agent needs to approach from the opposite direction. For example, to push the stone left (to pos32), the agent needs to be at pos42 and push left (to pos32). Wait, but the preconditions for pushing require that the agent is at l_p (adjacent to the stone's current location l_from), and then they push in direction d. So for pushtogoal or pushtonongoal, the agent must be at l_p, which is adjacent to l_from (the stone's current position), and then push the stone from l_from to l_to in direction d, which must be a valid movement from l_from.

So, for example, to push the stone from pos42 to pos32 (left), the agent needs to be at pos42's right (pos43?), but wait, the direction for pushing. Wait, the action "pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d" requires that the agent is at l_p, which must be adjacent to l_from (the stone's current position), and direction d must be from l_p to l_from, and then from l_from to l_to. Wait, the preconditions: (iv) you can get from location l_p to l_from following direction d, and (v) you can get from l_from to l_to following direction d. So the direction d must be such that moving from l_p to l_from is possible via direction d, and moving from l_from to l_to is possible via the same direction d. So the direction must be the same for both steps.

So for example, if the agent is at pos43 (l_p), and the stone is at pos42 (l_from), then moving from pos43 to pos42 would be direction dirleft (since from pos43, left is pos42?), and then from pos42, moving left would go to pos32. So the direction here is dirleft. So the action would be pushtonongoal (since pos32 is not a goal, but we might need to push it further towards the goal pos34). But wait, the goal is pos34, so we need to get the stone there.

Alternatively, maybe pushing the stone up from pos42 to pos32. Wait, no. The movement directions are defined as specific connections. Let me check the movement allowed from pos42:

Looking at the initial state's movement possibilities, from pos42, you can move to pos32 (dirleft), pos52 (dirright), pos41 (dirup), or pos43 (dirdown). So, the directions from pos42 are left, right, up, down. But pushing down to pos43 is forbidden for the stone.

So, to push the stone from pos42 to pos32 (left), the agent needs to be at pos43 (since from pos43 to pos42 is dirleft?), wait no. Let's check the movement from pos43 to pos42. The movement says: "You may move from location pos43 to location pos42 following direction dirup". Wait, how? Because pos43 is row4, column3. dirup would be row decreases by 1, so pos33? Or maybe directions are not aligned with grid directions. Wait, the movement directions are specific per location. For example, from pos42, moving up (dirup) leads to pos41. From pos42, moving left (dirleft) leads to pos32. From pos42, moving right (dirright) leads to pos52. Moving down (dirdown) leads to pos43.

So, to push the stone left from pos42 to pos32, the agent needs to be at pos42's right side, which is pos43. Wait, no. Because to push the stone left, the agent must be on the right side of the stone. So the agent is at pos43 (which is to the right of pos42), then can push the stone left to pos32. Wait, but according to the movement definitions, from pos43, moving left (dirleft) would go to pos42. So direction dirleft from pos43 to pos42. Then, the stone is at pos42, and pushing in direction dirleft would move it to pos32. So the action would be pushtogoal or pushtonongoal, depending on where it's going.

But pos32 is not a goal location. The only goal is pos34. So the stone needs to get from pos42 to pos34. Let's think of the path:

pos42 → pos32 (left) → pos33 (down) → pos34 (right? Or maybe up? Wait, pos33 to pos34 is dirdown? Let me check the movement from pos33. The movement from pos33 includes "You may move from location pos33 to location pos34 following direction dirdown". Wait, pos33 is row3, column3. dirdown would be to row4, column3 (pos43), but according to the given movement, pos33 to pos34 is direction dirdown? Wait, maybe the directions are not strictly aligned with grid directions. For example, pos33 to pos34 is dirright, but according to the movement given, from pos33, direction dirright leads to pos43. Wait, looking at the movement list:

Looking for pos33's movements: "You may move from location pos33 to location pos23 following direction dirleft", "You may move from location pos33 to location pos43 following direction dirright", "You may move from location pos33 to location pos32 following direction dirup", "You may move from location pos33 to location pos34 following direction dirdown". So from pos33, dirright is pos43, dirleft is pos23, dirup is pos32, dirdown is pos34.

Ah, okay. So from pos33, moving dirdown leads to pos34. So if the stone is at pos33, pushing it down (dirdown) would take it to pos34, which is the goal. So that's the target.

So the path would be:

pos42 → pos32 (left) → pos33 (up from pos32?) Wait, let's see. From pos32, possible movements: "You may move from location pos32 to location pos22 following direction dirleft", "You may move from location pos32 to location pos42 following direction dirright", "You may move from location pos32 to location pos31 following direction dirup", "You may move from location pos32 to location pos33 following direction dirdown". So from pos32, dirdown is pos33. So pushing the stone from pos32 to pos33 (dirdown), then from pos33 to pos34 (dirdown).

So the agent needs to push the stone from pos42 to pos32 (left), then from pos32 to pos33 (down), then from pos33 to pos34 (down). Each time, the agent has to position correctly.

But let's check the constraints. The agent must never be at pos43. So when moving the agent around, we have to avoid that. Also, stone1 must never be at pos43. So pushing it to pos43 is forbidden. Also, pos53 must always be clear, so we can't have the agent or stone there.

Additionally, the constraints require that pos15 is not clear at least once (so agent or stone must be there) and pos14 is not clear at least once. Also, in every state, pos53 is clear and player1 is not at pos43.

So, the plan must include steps where pos15 and pos14 are occupied. But the main goal is to move the stone to pos34. How to integrate these constraints.

First, let's focus on the stone's path. To get from pos42 to pos34:

1. Push stone1 from pos42 to pos32 (left). Agent needs to be at pos43 (to push left), but pos43 is a forbidden location for the agent. Wait, no. The constraint says player1 must never be at pos43. So agent cannot be at pos43 at any time. So pushing from pos43 is impossible. So that's a problem. Because to push the stone from pos42 to pos32, the agent would have to be at pos43, but that's forbidden. Therefore, that path is blocked.

Alternative approach: Can the agent push the stone from pos42 upwards to pos41? Let's check. From pos42, moving up (dirup) is to pos41. So pushing the stone up to pos41. But pos41 is not a goal. Then, from pos41, perhaps move the stone left or right. But pos41 is in row4, column1. To get to pos34 (row3, column4), that's a long way. Not sure if feasible.

Alternatively, push the stone right to pos52. But pos52 is not a goal, and then moving from there towards pos34 would require going through other positions. But maybe that's possible.

But perhaps another route. Let me think again. The agent is at pos12 initially. So they need to navigate to the stone's location, avoiding pos43.

Wait, the agent starts at pos12. To reach pos42 (where the stone is), the agent needs to move down. Let's see the movement possibilities.

From pos12, can move to pos22 (dirright), pos11 (dirup), pos13 (dirdown). Let's see a path from pos12 to pos42.

Possible steps:

pos12 → pos22 (dirright)

pos22 → pos32 (dirright)

pos32 → pos42 (dirright)

But wait, from pos32, dirright is pos42. So the agent can move from pos32 to pos42 via dirright. So the path would be:

move player1 pos12 pos22 dirright

move player1 pos22 pos32 dirright

move player1 pos32 pos42 dirright

But when the agent is at pos32, moving to pos42 is allowed. Once at pos42, the agent is at the same location as the stone? Wait, no. The stone is at pos42, so the agent can't move there unless it's clear. Wait, in the initial state, pos42 is clear? Wait, the original state says "Location pos42 is clear", but stone1 is at pos42. Wait, no. Wait, the initial state says "stone1 is at location pos42" and "Location pos42 is clear". That's a contradiction. Wait, no. Wait, the initial state lists "stone1 is at location pos42", which means that pos42 is occupied by the stone, so it's not clear. But then in the list of clear locations, "Location pos42 is clear" is not present. Wait, looking back:

The original state includes:

"stone1 is at location pos42"

Then, under "Location pos41 is clear"

"Location pos43 is clear"

"Location pos44 is clear"

"Location pos45 is clear"

So pos42 is not listed as clear. So pos42 is occupied by the stone. Therefore, the agent cannot move into pos42 unless pushing the stone.

So the agent can't move to pos42 directly. So to reach the stone, the agent must be adjacent to it. So the stone is at pos42. The agent needs to be at a location adjacent to pos42, which can be pos41 (up), pos43 (down), pos32 (left), or pos52 (right). But pos43 is forbidden for the agent, so the agent can't be there. So possible adjacent positions are pos41, pos32, pos52.

So, the agent can approach pos42 from pos41, pos32, or pos52.

So, to push the stone from pos42 to pos32 (left), the agent needs to be at pos42's right (pos43) but that's forbidden. So that's not possible. So pushing left is not possible. Alternatively, pushing up (from pos41). To push the stone up to pos41, the agent needs to be south of the stone (pos42's down is pos43, which is forbidden). Wait, no. To push the stone up, the agent must be at the position south of the stone (pos43) and push north. But pos43 is forbidden. So that's not possible.

Alternatively, pushing the stone right to pos52. To do that, the agent must be at pos51 (west of pos52) and push east. Wait, no. The stone is at pos42. To push it right (east) to pos52, the agent must be at pos42's west (pos41) and push east. Wait, no. Let's think again. The direction for pushing: if the agent is at pos43 (east of pos42), and pushes west, then the stone moves west. But pos43 is forbidden.

Alternatively, the agent can be at pos32 (north of pos42), and push south. Because from pos32 to pos42 is dirright (east?), but according to the movement definitions, from pos32, dirright is pos42. So direction dirright. So if the agent is at pos32, and pushes dirright to pos42, then the stone would move dirright to pos43? No, wait. The action requires that the agent is at l_p (pos32), pushes the stone from l_from (pos42) to l_to (pos43) via direction dirright. Wait, no. Wait, the preconditions for pushtogoal/pushtonongoal are:

- agent is at l_p (adjacent to l_from)
- stone is at l_from
- l_to is clear
- can move from l_p to l_from via direction d
- can move from l_from to l_to via direction d
- l_to is goal or non-goal accordingly.

So if the agent is at pos32 (l_p), and the stone is at pos42 (l_from), then moving from pos32 to pos42 is direction dirright (since "You may move from location pos32 to location pos42 following direction dirright"). Then, from pos42, moving dirright would take it to pos52. So direction d would be dirright. So the action would be pushtonongoal, since pos52 is not a goal.

So the agent can push the stone from pos42 to pos52 via dirright, with the agent at pos32. But then, the stone is at pos52. But pos52 is not a goal. Then, how to get the stone from pos52 to pos34? That seems complicated. Maybe this is a detour.

Alternatively, push the stone up from pos42 to pos41. To do that, the agent needs to be south of pos42 (pos43) but that's forbidden. So can't do that.

Another option: push the stone left to pos32. But as earlier, the agent can't be at pos43 to push it left. Wait, but maybe the agent can approach from pos32. Wait, if the agent is at pos32, can they push the stone left? Let's see. From pos32, the agent can move to pos42 via dirright. So the direction d is dirright. Then, the stone is at pos42, and pushing it dirright would move it to pos52. Wait, no. Wait, the direction is dirright from l_p (pos32) to l_from (pos42), then dirright from l_from (pos42) to l_to (pos52). So the agent is at pos32, pushes the stone from pos42 to pos52. That's possible, but not helpful for getting to pos34.

Alternatively, if the agent is at pos41 (north of pos42), can they push the stone south to pos43? But pos43 is forbidden for the stone. So that's not allowed.

Hmm. This is a problem. The agent cannot push the stone left or down because of the constraints. So perhaps the only way is to push it right to pos52, then up to pos53, but pos53 must remain clear, so the stone can't go there. Wait, the constraint says pos53 must always be clear. So stone can't be there, and agent can't be there either. So pushing the stone to pos53 is invalid.

Alternative path: push the stone from pos42 to pos32 (left). But how? The agent can't be at pos43. Wait, maybe the agent can approach from pos32. Wait, if the agent is at pos32, then to push the stone left (from pos42 to pos32?), but that would require the stone to be at pos42 and the agent at pos32, and direction dirright. Wait, the agent is at pos32, pushes the stone from pos42 to pos32? No, that's not possible. Because the stone is at pos42, and the agent is at pos32. The direction from pos32 to pos42 is dirright. So pushing the stone from pos42 to pos32 would require the direction dirleft, but the movement from pos42 to pos32 is dirleft. So the agent would need to be at pos43 (east of pos42) to push it west to pos32, but pos43 is forbidden.

This seems like a dead end. Maybe there's another approach. Let's think about the constraints again.

We need to satisfy that pos15 is not clear at least once and pos14 is not clear at least once. So during the plan, the agent must visit pos15 or pos14, or push the stone there. But the stone's goal is pos34, which is far from these positions. So maybe the agent needs to make a detour to step on pos15 and pos14 to satisfy those constraints.

So, the plan could involve:

1. Move the agent from pos12 to pos15, stepping on pos14 along the way, to satisfy the constraints.

But how? Let's see the movement from pos12 to pos15. The agent is at pos12. Possible moves:

pos12 → pos13 (dirdown)

pos13 → pos14 (dirdown)

pos14 → pos15 (dirdown)

So moving down thrice to reach pos15. But when moving to pos14, that would make pos14 not clear (since the agent is there), satisfying the constraint that pos14 must be not clear at least once. Then moving to pos15, which would satisfy pos15 not clear. Then, after that, the agent needs to move back towards the stone.

But this would take several steps. However, the agent must also avoid being at pos43 at any time.

But maybe this is necessary to satisfy the constraints. Let's outline this:

First, move the agent to pos15 via pos13 and pos14:

move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown

move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown

move player1 pos14 pos15 dirdown

This covers the constraints for pos14 and pos15. Then, the agent needs to go back to the stone's area.

But that's a lot of steps. Once the agent is at pos15, they can move to pos25 via dirright, then pos35, etc. But this might be time-consuming. However, since we need an optimal plan (shortest possible), this detour might not be optimal. But the constraints require that pos14 and pos15 are not clear at least once. So the agent must step on them or push the stone there. Since the stone is at pos42, pushing it to pos14 or pos15 would be a long way, but maybe the agent can step on them during movement.

Alternatively, after pushing the stone to the goal, the agent can move to pos14 and pos15 to satisfy the constraints. But the constraints require that these are true in at least one state. So as long as during the plan, these locations are occupied at some point, it's okay. So perhaps after moving the stone to the goal, the agent can move to pos14 and pos15. But the stone's path is the main issue.

But let's get back to the stone's movement. Given the constraints, the agent can't be at pos43, and the stone can't be at pos43. So the only way to move the stone from pos42 is to push it right to pos52 or up to pos41.

Wait, pushing up to pos41: the agent needs to be at pos42's down (pos43), which is forbidden. So can't push up. So the only option is to push right to pos52. Let's try that.

So, to push the stone from pos42 to pos52, the agent needs to be at pos32 (since from pos32 to pos42 is dirright). Wait, no. The agent needs to be at a position adjacent to the stone's current location (pos42), and in a direction that allows pushing. For example, to push the stone right (dirright) to pos52, the agent needs to be at pos42's left (pos32) and push right. Because moving from pos32 to pos42 is dirright, and then from pos42 to pos52 is dirright. So direction dirright. So the action would be:

pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos42 pos52 dirright

After this action, the stone is at pos52, and the agent is at pos42. But pos42 is now clear? Wait, the effect of pushtonongoal is that the agent moves from l_p (pos32) to l_from (pos42), and the stone moves to l_to (pos52). So after this action, the agent is at pos42, and the stone is at pos52. But pos42 was originally occupied by the stone, so after pushing, pos42 becomes clear, and the agent is there. But initially, pos42 was not clear (since the stone was there), but after the action, the agent is at pos42, making it occupied again. Wait, the effects of pushtonongoal are:

(i) agent p is no longer at l_p (pos32)

(ii) stone s is no longer at l_from (pos42)

(iii) l_to (pos52) is no longer clear

(iv) agent p is at l_from (pos42)

(v) stone s is at l_to (pos52)

(vi) l_p (pos32) is clear

So after this action, the agent is at pos42, which was previously occupied by the stone. But pos42 is now clear? No, because the agent is there. So pos42 is now occupied by the agent. So pos42 is not clear anymore.

But the agent is now at pos42. From there, where can they go? They need to push the stone further. But the stone is at pos52. To push it further towards the goal.

From pos52, possible movements are left (pos42), right (pos62 which doesn't exist), up (pos51), or down (pos53). But pos53 must remain clear, so pushing down to pos53 is invalid. So the stone can't go there. So the only options are left (back to pos42) or up to pos51.

But pushing up to pos51 would require the agent to be south of pos52 (pos53), which is forbidden. So can't do that. So the stone is stuck at pos52.

This path doesn't seem helpful. So maybe this approach isn't working.

Alternative Idea: Maybe the agent can push the stone from pos42 to pos32 via a different path. Wait, if the agent can't be at pos43, maybe they can approach from the north. Let's see. The agent is at pos32. From there, they can move to pos42 via dirright. But the stone is already at pos42. So to push the stone from pos42 to pos32, the agent needs to be at pos42's east (pos43) and push west, but pos43 is forbidden. So no.

Wait, what if the agent moves around to pos51, then to pos52, then to pos42? But pos42 is occupied by the stone. So the agent can't move there unless pushing.

Alternatively, the agent could move from pos12 to pos22, then to pos32, then to pos42 (but pos42 is occupied by the stone). So the agent can't move there. So the agent can only reach pos32, and from there, push the stone to pos52.

But that doesn't help. So maybe there's another way. Let's think about the grid.

The only goal location is pos34. The stone is at pos42. The agent must push it to pos34. But the agent can't go to pos43. So how?

Perhaps the stone needs to go through pos33. To get to pos33, the stone would need to be pushed from pos32 to pos33. So the agent could push the stone from pos32 to pos33, then from pos33 to pos34.

But how to get the stone to pos32? Earlier attempts were blocked because the agent can't be at pos43. So maybe the agent can push the stone from pos42 to pos32 by approaching from the west. Wait, pos32 is to the west of pos42. So to push the stone west from pos42 to pos32, the agent needs to be east of pos42 (pos43), which is forbidden. So no.

Alternative Idea: Is there any other path? For example, moving the stone up to pos41, then left to pos31, then up to pos21, etc. But that's moving away from the goal. Not helpful.

Wait, perhaps the agent can push the stone from pos42 to pos32 by a different route. Let me check the movement options again.

From pos42, moving left is pos32. To push left, the agent must be at pos43 (east of pos42), push west. But pos43 is forbidden. So that's not possible. So the only way to push the stone left is if the agent can approach from another direction. But I don't see another way.

This seems impossible. But the problem states that a valid plan exists. So I must be missing something.

Wait, the movement directions might not align with the grid as I'm assuming. For example, from pos32, moving dirright is pos42. So if the agent is at pos32 and pushes the stone from pos42 to pos32, that would be moving the stone west. But the stone is at pos42, and the agent is at pos32. How can the agent push the stone west? Because the agent is west of the stone. So to push the stone west, the agent must be east of the stone. But that's pos43, which is forbidden.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the directions. The directions are defined per location. For example, from pos32, dirright leads to pos42. So dirright is east. So to push the stone west from pos42, the agent must be east of pos42 (pos43) and push west. But that's forbidden.

Alternatively, perhaps the agent can push the stone north from pos42 to pos32. Wait, pos32 is north of pos42. To push north, the agent must be south of the stone (pos43) and push north. Again, pos43 is forbidden.

So this seems impossible. But the problem must have a solution. Let me re-examine the initial state and constraints.

Wait, the initial state says "Location pos42 is clear". But the stone is at pos42. That's a contradiction. Wait, no. Let me check the original state again.

Original state:

- "stone1 is at location pos42"

Under "Location pos41 is clear"

"Location pos43 is clear"

"Location pos44 is clear"

"Location pos45 is clear"

So pos42 is not listed as clear, which makes sense because the stone is there. So pos42 is occupied by the stone, not clear.

So the agent can't move into pos42 unless pushing.

So the agent must be adjacent to pos42 to push it.

Possible adjacent positions: pos41 (north), pos43 (south), pos32 (west), pos52 (east).

But pos43 is forbidden for the agent, so the agent can't be there. So the agent can approach from pos41, pos32, or pos52.

So, possible pushing directions:

- From pos41 (north), push south to pos42 → pos43 (invalid).

- From pos32 (west), push east to pos42 → pos43 (invalid).

- From pos52 (east), push west to pos42 → pos32.

Wait, if the agent is at pos52 (east of pos42), and pushes west, the stone would move west from pos42 to pos32. But to be at pos52, the agent needs to get there. How?

The agent starts at pos12. To reach pos52, they need to move right and down. Let's see:

pos12 → pos13 (dirdown)

pos13 → pos14 (dirdown)

pos14 → pos15 (dirdown)

pos15 → pos25 (dirright)

pos25 → pos35 (dirright)

pos35 → pos45 (dirright)

pos45 → pos55 (dirright)

But pos55 is the end. Alternatively, from pos15, move to pos25, then pos24, etc. Not sure.

Alternatively, pos12 → pos22 (dirright)

pos22 → pos32 (dirright)

pos32 → pos42 (dirright) but can't because it's occupied by the stone.

Wait, but the agent can't move to pos42 because it's occupied. So from pos32, the agent can't move to pos42 via dirright.

So, to get to pos52, the agent would have to go through pos51. Let's see:

pos12 → pos13 (dirdown)

pos13 → pos14 (dirdown)

pos14 → pos15 (dirdown)

pos15 → pos25 (dirright)

pos25 → pos35 (dirright)

pos35 → pos45 (dirright)

pos45 → pos55 (dirright)

pos55 → pos54 (dirup)

pos54 → pos53 (dirup) → but pos53 must remain clear. So agent can't be there.

This path is blocked.

Alternative route from pos12 to pos52:

pos12 → pos22 (dirright)

pos22 → pos32 (dirright)

pos32 → pos42 (dirright) → can't, occupied.

So stuck.

Alternatively, pos12 → pos13 (dirdown)

pos13 → pos23 (dirright)

pos23 → pos33 (dirright)

pos33 → pos43 (dirright) → forbidden.

No. So it's difficult to reach pos52.

So, pushing the stone from pos42 to pos52 seems impossible because the agent can't reach pos52 to push it west.

This suggests that the only possible way is to push the stone to pos32, but the agent can't reach the required position to do that due to pos43 being forbidden.

This is a contradiction. The problem must have a solution, so I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe there's a different path. Let's consider the agent moving to pos32, then pushing the stone from pos42 to pos32 via a different direction.

Wait, from pos32, dirright is pos42. So if the agent is at pos32 and pushes the stone from pos42 to pos32, that would require moving the stone west. But the stone is at pos42, and the agent is at pos32. The direction from pos32 to pos42 is dirright. So pushing the stone from pos42 to pos32 would require the direction to be dirleft. But the movement from pos42 to pos32 is dirleft.

So the action would be pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos42 pos32 dirleft? No, because the agent can't push the stone into their own position. Wait, the stone is at pos42, and the agent is at pos32. To push the stone west to pos32, the agent must be at pos42's east (pos43) and push west. But that's forbidden.

Alternatively, the agent is at pos32 and somehow pushes the stone west. But according to the movement definitions, from pos32 to pos42 is dirright. So to push the stone from pos42 to pos32, the direction would be dirleft. The agent must be able to move from their current location (l_p) to l_from (pos42) via direction d, which is dirright. Then, from l_from (pos42) to l_to (pos32) via dirleft. But the action requires that both movements use the same direction d. Wait, no. The preconditions for pushtogoal/pushtonongoal are:

(iv) you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d

(v) you can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d

So the direction d must be the same for both steps. So if the agent is at pos32 (l_p), and the stone is at pos42 (l_from), then direction d must allow moving from pos32 to pos42 (dirright), and from pos42 to pos32 (dirleft). But these are different directions. So this is not possible. Therefore, the agent can't push the stone from pos42 to pos32 while being at pos32.

This seems to confirm that it's impossible to push the stone left from pos42.

Alternative Idea: Maybe the stone can be pushed up to pos41. To do that, the agent must be south of pos42 (pos43), which is forbidden. So impossible.

Hmm. This is a dead end. But the problem must have a solution, so I'm missing something. Let's think outside the box.

Wait, the constraint says that pos53 must always be clear. So the agent can't go there, and the stone can't either. Also, the agent must never be at pos43, and the stone must never be at pos43. So the only way to push the stone is to the west or east, but the agent can't reach the required positions.

Wait, maybe the stone can be pushed up to pos41 via a different path. Let's see:

The agent is at pos41 (north of pos42). To push the stone south to pos43, which is forbidden. So no. But if the agent is at pos41, can they push the stone north to pos31? No, because the stone is at pos42. To push it north, the agent must be south of pos42 (pos43), which is forbidden.

Wait, perhaps the agent can push the stone east to pos52, then north to pos51, then west to pos41, but that seems convoluted and the stone would be moving away from the goal.

Alternatively, the stone is pushed east to pos52, then north to pos51, then west to pos41, then north to pos31, then west to pos21, etc. But this is a long path, and the goal is pos34. Not helpful.

Alternatively, after pushing to pos52, the agent can push it up to pos51, then left to pos41, but again, not helpful.

This seems like a dead end. Perhaps the problem requires that the agent steps on pos14 and pos15 during their movement, which would satisfy the constraints, and then finds a way to push the stone to pos34.

Wait, the agent's initial position is pos12. To reach the stone, they might need to go through pos22, pos32, etc., but avoiding pos43.

Let me try to map a path for the agent to reach pos32, then push the stone to pos52, then from there find a way to push it towards pos34.

Agent's path:

1. move from pos12 to pos22 (dirright)

2. move from pos22 to pos32 (dirright)

Now, agent is at pos32. Stone is at pos42.

Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos42 pos52 dirright

Now, stone is at pos52, agent is at pos42.

But pos42 is now occupied by the agent.

Next, agent needs to push the stone further. From pos52, possible directions are left (pos42), up (pos51), or down (pos53, forbidden).

So push the stone up to pos51. To do that, the agent needs to be south of pos52 (pos53), which is forbidden. So can't.

Alternatively, push the stone left back to pos42. Not helpful.

This seems stuck.

Alternative Idea: After pushing the stone to pos52, the agent can move to pos42 (now clear?), but wait, after the push, the agent is at pos42. So pos42 is now occupied by the agent. The stone is at pos52. So the agent can move from pos42 to pos43 (forbidden), or pos32, pos41, pos52.

But pos43 is forbidden. So agent can move to pos32 (dirleft), pos41 (dirup), or pos52 (dirright).

If the agent moves to pos52 (dirright), then they can push the stone further. But from pos52, pushing the stone west to pos42, which is occupied by the agent. Not possible.

Hmm. This isn't working.

Wait, maybe there's a different way. Let's consider that the stone needs to go to pos34, which is a goal. pos34 is in row3, column4. So if the stone can be pushed from pos33 to pos34 (dirdown), that's the way. So how to get the stone to pos33.

Pos33 can be reached from pos32 (dirdown), pos23 (dirright), pos43 (dirleft, forbidden), or pos34 (dirup).

So if the agent can get the stone to pos32, then push it down to pos33, then down to pos34.

But getting the stone to pos32 is the problem. How?

The only way is to push it from pos42 to pos32, but the agent can't be at pos43 to do that. So that's impossible. Unless there's another path.

Wait, perhaps the agent can move around the grid to pos51, then pos52, then push the stone west to pos42, but that's where the stone was initially. Not helpful.

This is very confusing. Maybe I need to think of the problem differently. Let's look at the constraints again:

- pos53 must always be clear.

- At least once, pos15 not clear.

- Agent never at pos43.

- At least once, pos14 not clear.

- Stone never at pos43.

The key constraints blocking the obvious path are the agent never being at pos43 and stone never at pos43. So the stone cannot pass through pos43, and the agent can't be there either.

So the stone must take a path that avoids pos43. The only possible path from pos42 to pos34 without going through pos43 is:

pos42 → pos32 (left) → pos33 (down) → pos34 (down)

But how to push from pos42 to pos32? The agent can't be at pos43. So perhaps there's a way for the agent to push from pos32 to pos42, then pos42 to pos32? No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe the agent can push the stone from pos42 to pos32 by being at pos32 and pushing left. Wait, but pos32 is west of pos42. To push the stone left from pos42 to pos32, the agent must be east of pos42 (pos43) and push west. But pos43 is forbidden.

This seems impossible. But the problem must have a solution. Maybe I'm missing a movement direction that allows this.

Let me recheck the movement options from pos32 and pos42.

From pos32: You may move to pos22 (dirleft), pos42 (dirright), pos31 (dirup), pos33 (dirdown).

From pos42: You may move to pos32 (dirleft), pos52 (dirright), pos41 (dirup), pos43 (dirdown).

So, from pos32 to pos42 is dirright. From pos42 to pos32 is dirleft.

So, if the agent is at pos32 and wants to push the stone from pos42 to pos32, the direction would be dirleft. But the agent must be able to move from pos32 to pos42 (dirright) and then from pos42 to pos32 (dirleft). But the action requires the same direction for both steps. So direction dirright would mean moving from pos32 to pos42, then from pos42 to pos52. So the same direction (dirright) would move the stone to pos52. Which isn't helpful.

Alternatively, using direction dirleft, but the agent can't move from pos32 to pos42 via dirleft. Because from pos32, dirleft is pos22. So that's not possible.

So this approach doesn't work.

Alternative Idea: Maybe the agent can push the stone from pos42 to pos41 (up), then pos41 to pos31 (left), then pos31 to pos32 (down), then pos32 to pos33 (down), then pos33 to pos34 (down). But pushing up to pos41 requires the agent to be at pos43 (south of pos42), which is forbidden. So no.

This is really challenging. Let's think about the constraints again. The agent must visit pos14 and pos15 at least once. So perhaps the plan involves the agent moving to those locations, then proceeding to push the stone.

So here's an outline:

1. Agent moves from pos12 to pos13 (dirdown).

2. Agent moves from pos13 to pos14 (dirdown). Now, pos14 is not clear, satisfying one constraint.

3. Agent moves from pos14 to pos15 (dirdown). Now, pos15 is not clear, satisfying another constraint.

4. Agent moves back up to pos14 (dirup).

5. Agent moves to pos24 (dirright).

6. Agent moves to pos34 (dirright). But pos34 is a goal location.

But how does this help with the stone? The agent is now at pos34, but the stone is still at pos42.

Alternatively, after step 3, the agent needs to navigate to the stone's area. Let's see:

After step 3, agent is at pos15. Then:

pos15 → pos25 (dirright)

pos25 → pos35 (dirright)

pos35 → pos45 (dirright)

pos45 → pos44 (dirup)

pos44 → pos34 (dirleft)

Now, agent is at pos34. But this doesn't help with the stone.

Alternatively, from pos15, the agent moves to pos25, then pos24, pos23, etc., to reach pos32.

But this is a long path, and I'm not sure how it helps.

Alternatively, after satisfying the constraints, the agent moves back to pos12, then proceeds to pos22, pos32, and pushes the stone to pos52. But this doesn't solve the problem.

I'm stuck. Perhaps I need to look for an alternative approach that satisfies the constraints while moving the stone.

Another Idea: The agent must push the stone to pos34. The stone is at pos42. The agent needs to navigate around to pos34 and pull the stone towards them. But in this domain, the agent can only push, not pull. So that's not possible.

Wait, the agent can push the stone from pos33 to pos34. If the agent can get the stone to pos33, then one push to pos34.

But how to get the stone to pos33. From pos42, the stone needs to go to pos32, then to pos33.

But pushing from pos42 to pos32 requires the agent to be at pos43, which is forbidden.

Wait, unless there's a different path for the stone. For example, pos42 → pos52 → pos53 (but pos53 must be clear), so invalid. Or pos42 → pos41 → pos31 → pos32 → pos33.

But pushing up to pos41 requires the agent to be at pos43, which is forbidden. So invalid.

I'm really stuck here. Maybe the solution is to have the agent move to pos14 and pos15 to satisfy the constraints, then find a way to push the stone to pos34 via a different route that avoids pos43.

But how?

Wait, maybe the stone can be pushed up to pos41. If the agent is at pos41, can they push the stone up to pos31? Let's see:

Agent is at pos41. Stone is at pos42. To push the stone north to pos41, the agent must be south of pos42 (pos43), which is forbidden. So no.

Alternative Idea: The agent moves from pos12 to pos22, pos32, then pos31, pos41. Then, from pos41, push the stone west to pos31. But the stone is at pos42. To push west from pos42, the agent must be at pos43 (east of pos42), which is forbidden.

This isn't working. I must be missing something.

Wait, let's look at the movement from pos32 to pos42. If the agent is at pos32, they can move to pos42 via dirright. But pos42 is occupied by the stone. So they can't move there unless they push the stone.

So the agent is at pos32, and the stone is at pos42. The agent can perform a pushtonongoal action to push the stone from pos42 to pos52 (dirright). This is allowed, as pos52 is not a goal. After this, the agent is at pos42, and the stone is at pos52.

Then, the agent can move from pos42 to pos41 (dirup), then pos41 to pos31 (dirleft), pos31 to pos32 (dirdown), pos32 to pos33 (dirdown), pos33 to pos34 (dirdown).

Now, the agent is at pos34. The stone is at pos52. Then, the agent needs to go back to pos52 to push the stone. But this seems too long.

Alternatively, after pushing the stone to pos52, the agent moves to pos52 (from pos42, dirright to pos52). But pos52 is now occupied by the stone, so the agent can't move there unless pushing again. So the agent needs to push the stone from pos52 to pos53, but pos53 must remain clear. So that's invalid.

This is really challenging. I think the key is to realize that the stone can be pushed from pos42 to pos32 without the agent being at pos43. But how?

Wait, another Idea: The agent can move to pos41 (north of pos42) and push the stone east to pos52. No, because the agent is at pos41, to push east, the stone would move from pos42 to pos43, which is forbidden.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Maybe the solution involves the agent moving to pos14 and pos15 to satisfy constraints, then moving to pos32 and pushing the stone to pos52, then somehow pushing it up to pos53 (invalid), but that's not allowed.

Alternatively, perhaps the stone can be pushed from pos52 to pos42 again, then to pos32. But that's going back.

I'm running out of ideas. Perhaps the solution is to push the stone from pos42 to pos32 using a different direction that doesn't require the agent to be at pos43.

Wait, the movement from pos42 to pos32 is dirleft. So to push the stone left, the agent must be at pos43 (dirleft from pos43 to pos42), then push left to pos32. But pos43 is forbidden.

This is impossible. Therefore, the only possible way is to push the stone right to pos52, then find another path.

But how to get from pos52 to pos34? It's not clear. Maybe the agent can push the stone from pos52 to pos42 (left), then pos42 to pos32 (left), but that's back to square one.

Alternatively, the agent can push the stone from pos52 to pos51 (up), then pos51 to pos41 (left), pos41 to pos31 (up), pos31 to pos21 (left), etc. But this moves the stone away from the goal.

I think I'm missing something. Let's look again at the movement options for pos34. pos34 can be reached from pos24 (dirleft), pos44 (dirright), pos33 (dirup), pos35 (dirdown). So the stone needs to be at pos33 or pos24 or pos44 to reach pos34.

But the stone is at pos42. How to get it to pos33?

If the agent can't push it directly from pos42 to pos32, perhaps there's a way to push it up to pos41, then left to pos31, then up to pos21, then right to pos22, then down to pos32, then down to pos33, then down to pos34. But this is a very long path and may not be optimal.

But considering the constraints, this might be the only way. However, this would require many steps, and the problem asks for an optimal plan, which is as short as possible.

Given the time I've spent and the lack of progress, I think I need to propose a plan that satisfies the constraints and moves the stone to the goal, even if I'm not sure about the path.

Here's a possible plan:

1. Agent moves from pos12 to pos13 (dirdown).

2. Agent moves from pos13 to pos14 (dirdown) → satisfies pos14 not clear.

3. Agent moves from pos14 to pos15 (dirdown) → satisfies pos15 not clear.

4. Agent moves back to pos14 (dirup).

5. Agent moves to pos24 (dirright).

6. Agent moves to pos34 (dirright) → now at the goal location.

But the stone is still at pos42. So this doesn't solve the problem.

Another Idea: After step 3, agent moves to pos25 (dirright), then to pos35 (dirright), pos45 (dirright), pos44 (dirup), pos43 (forbidden). No.

Alternative path from pos15:

pos15 → pos25 (dirright)

pos25 → pos24 (dirup)

pos24 → pos34 (dirright)

Now, agent is at pos34. But how to push the stone from pos42 to pos34? The agent is at pos34, which is far from the stone.

This isn't working. I think I need to give up and propose a hypothetical plan that assumes the agent can push the stone from pos42 to pos32 despite the constraints, but I know it's impossible.

Alternatively, maybe the agent can push the stone from pos42 to pos33 directly. But according to movement definitions, from pos42, possible moves are left, right, up, down. pos33 is not directly accessible from pos42. So no.

I think I'm stuck. Given the time I've spent and the lack of progress, I'll propose a plan that moves the agent to satisfy the constraints and then pushes the stone to the goal, even if it's not the correct path.

But I'm not confident. However, I'll proceed with the following steps, acknowledging that there might be a mistake:

1. move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown

2. move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown (satisfies pos14 not clear)

3. move player1 pos14 pos15 dirdown (satisfies pos15 not clear)

4. move player1 pos15 pos14 dirup

5. move player1 pos14 pos24 dirright

6. move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright (now at pos34)

Then, somehow push the stone to pos34. But the agent is at pos34, and the stone is at pos42. They need to get to the stone.

This doesn't make sense. I think I need to include pushing actions.

Alternative Plan:

1. move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown

2. move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown

3. move player1 pos14 pos24 dirright (now at pos24)

4. move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright (now at pos34)

5. move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup

6. move player1 pos33 pos32 dirup

7. move player1 pos32 pos42 dirright (can't, occupied by stone)

So stuck.

Alternative Idea: After step 4 (agent at pos34), push the stone from pos42 to pos34. But how? The agent is at pos34, and the stone is at pos42. They are not adjacent.

This is not possible. So the plan is invalid.

Given the time I've spent and the need to provide an answer, I'll proceed with a possible plan that moves the agent to pos32 and pushes the stone to pos52, then to pos53, but this violates the constraints. Therefore, this is invalid.

I think the correct solution involves the agent moving to pos32, pushing the stone to pos52, then moving around to push it north to pos51, then west to pos41, but this seems too long. However, considering the constraints, here's a possible valid plan:

```
move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown
move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown
move player1 pos14 pos24 dirright
move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright
move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup
move player1 pos33 pos32 dirup
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos42 pos52 dirright
move player1 pos42 pos52 dirright
pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos52 pos52 pos34 [invalid, no such direction]
```

This is not working. I'm clearly missing the correct path. Given the time constraints, I'll provide the following plan, acknowledging that it might not be correct but attempting to satisfy the constraints and the goal:

```
move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown
move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown
move player1 pos14 pos24 dirright
move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright
pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos42 pos34 [invalid, as the stone is not adjacent]
```

I realize this is incorrect, but I'm unable to find the correct path due to the constraints blocking the obvious solution. The correct plan likely involves pushing the stone from pos42 to pos32 using an allowed path that I'm not seeing, possibly involving moving the agent through pos32 and then pushing the stone west. However, due to the constraints, this might require a longer path that satisfies the constraints.
