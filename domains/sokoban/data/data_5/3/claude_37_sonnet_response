Let's begin by analyzing the problem:

1. We have a 2D grid.
2. There's a player (player1) and a stone (stone1) on the grid.
3. We need to push the stone to a goal location. The only goal location is pos34.
4. The player starts at pos12 and the stone starts at pos42.
5. There are constraints:
   - Location pos53 must always be clear.
   - Location pos15 must not be clear at some point.
   - player1 must never be at location pos43.
   - Location pos14 must not be clear at some point.
   - stone1 must never be at location pos43.

Let's represent the grid to better understand the problem:

```
   1  2  3  4  5
1 [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]
2 [ ][P][ ][ ][ ]
3 [ ][ ][ ][G][ ]
4 [ ][S][ ][ ][ ]
5 [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]
```

Where:
- P represents player1's starting position.
- S represents stone1's starting position.
- G represents the goal location (pos34).

We need to move the player to a position where they can push the stone to the goal. The player can't enter pos43 due to the constraint.

Let's think about how to push the stone from pos42 to pos34:

1. The player can't go to pos43 to push the stone from the right.
2. The player could go to pos32 and push the stone down to pos33, and then go to pos23 and push the stone to pos34.
3. The player could go to pos52 and push the stone left to pos33, and then go to pos23 and push the stone to pos34.

Let's go with the second approach:

1. Move from pos12 to pos22 (dirright).
2. Move from pos22 to pos32 (dirright).
3. Now, the player is above the stone. Push the stone down from pos42 to pos43 (dirdown). But wait, we can't move the stone to pos43 due to the constraint "stone1 is not at location pos43".

Let's go with the third approach:

1. Move from pos12 to pos22 (dirright).
2. Move from pos22 to pos32 (dirright).
3. Move from pos32 to pos31 (dirup).
4. Move from pos31 to pos41 (dirright).
5. Move from pos41 to pos51 (dirright).
6. Move from pos51 to pos52 (dirdown).
7. Now, the player is to the right of the stone. Push the stone left from pos42 to pos32 (dirleft).
8. Move from pos42 to pos43 (dirdown).
9. Wait, this contradicts the constraint "player1 is not at location pos43".

Let's reconsider. The player can't go to pos43 and the stone can't go to pos43. So, we need to find another route.

What if we push the stone up from pos42 to pos32, then to pos33, and finally to pos34?

1. Move from pos12 to pos22 (dirright).
2. Move from pos22 to pos32 (dirright).
3. Move from pos32 to pos31 (dirup).
4. Move from pos31 to pos41 (dirright).
5. Move from pos41 to pos42 (dirdown).
6. Push the stone up from pos42 to pos32 (dirup).
7. Move from pos32 to pos33 (dirdown).
8. Now, the player is to the left of the stone. Push the stone right from pos33 to pos34 (dirright). This satisfies the goal.

But we also have to address the constraints about making pos14 and pos15 not clear at some point. We can do this by moving the player to those locations at some point.

Let's refine the plan:

1. Move from pos12 to pos13 (dirdown).
2. Move from pos13 to pos14 (dirdown). This makes pos14 not clear, which satisfies the constraint.
3. Move from pos14 to pos15 (dirdown). This makes pos15 not clear, which satisfies the constraint.
4. Move from pos15 to pos25 (dirright).
5. Move from pos25 to pos35 (dirright).
6. Move from pos35 to pos34 (dirup).
7. Move from pos34 to pos33 (dirup).
8. Move from pos33 to pos32 (dirup).
9. Move from pos32 to pos31 (dirup).
10. Move from pos31 to pos41 (dirright).
11. Move from pos41 to pos42 (dirdown).
12. Push the stone up from pos42 to pos32 (dirup).
13. Move from pos32 to pos33 (dirdown).
14. Push the stone right from pos33 to pos34 (dirright). This pushes the stone to the goal, which satisfies the main goal.

Let's check the constraints:
- Location pos53 is clear throughout the plan.
- Location pos15 is not clear at some point (step 3).
- player1 is not at location pos43 throughout the plan.
- Location pos14 is not clear at some point (step 2).
- stone1 is not at location pos43 throughout the plan.

Actually, a little change to the plan: since we need to use the `pushtogoal` action to push the stone to pos34, we need to ensure that pos34 is indeed a goal location.

Let's re-check the initial state. pos34 is specified as a goal location, so we're good.

Now, let's ensure our actions are consistent with the provided action specifications:

For "move p l_from l_to d":
- Agent p is at location l_from.
- Location l_to is clear.
- You can move from location l_from to location l_to following direction d.

For "pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d":
- Agent p is at location l_p.
- Stone s is at location l_from.
- Location l_to is clear.
- You can move from location l_p to location l_from following direction d.
- You can move from location l_from to location l_to following direction d.
- Location l_to is a goal location.

For "pushtonongoal p s l_p l_from l_to d":
- Agent p is at location l_p.
- Stone s is at location l_from.
- Location l_to is clear.
- You can move from location l_p to location l_from following direction d.
- You can move from location l_from to location l_to following direction d.
- Location l_to is not a goal location.

Now, let's check our plan:

The state is specified somewhat oddly. It says "player1 is at location pos12" but also "Location pos12 is clear". This is contradictory. Also, it says "stone1 is at location pos42" but also "Location pos42 is clear". 

But, looking at the logical preconditions of the actions, it's clear that a location is considered "clear" if it doesn't have a stone or an agent on it. Given the provided actions' preconditions and effects, we have to assume that the initial state is explicitly stating that the player is at pos12 and the stone is at pos42, and these locations are NOT clear (despite the explicit states of "Location pos12 is clear" and "Location pos42 is clear").

Let's reconsider our plan, given that the player is at pos12 and the stone is at pos42:

1. Move from pos12 to pos13 (dirdown). Since pos13 is clear, this is valid.
2. Move from pos13 to pos14 (dirdown). Since pos14 is clear, this is valid.
3. Move from pos14 to pos15 (dirdown). Since pos15 is clear, this is valid.
4. Move from pos15 to pos25 (dirright). Since pos25 is clear, this is valid.
5. Move from pos25 to pos35 (dirright). Since pos35 is clear, this is valid.
6. Move from pos35 to pos34 (dirup). Since pos34 is clear, this is valid.
7. Move from pos34 to pos33 (dirup). Since pos33 is clear, this is valid.
8. Move from pos33 to pos23 (dirleft). Since pos23 is clear, this is valid.
9. Move from pos23 to pos24 (dirdown). Since pos24 is clear, this is valid.
10. Move from pos24 to pos34 (dirright). Since pos34 is clear, this is valid.
11. Move from pos34 to pos44 (dirright). Since pos44 is clear, this is valid.
12. Move from pos44 to pos43 (dirup). Wait, this violates the constraint "player1 is not at location pos43".

Let's revise our approach again.

It's a bit tricky because the player can't go to pos43, and the stone can't go to pos43 either. But I'll try a different approach.

What if we push the stone from the right, and then from below? Let's trace this plan:

1. Move from pos12 to pos13 (dirdown). This makes pos12 clear and pos13 not clear.
2. Move from pos13 to pos14 (dirdown). This makes pos13 clear and pos14 not clear. This also satisfies the constraint "Location pos14 is not clear".
3. Move from pos14 to pos15 (dirdown). This makes pos14 clear and pos15 not clear. This also satisfies the constraint "Location pos15 is not clear".
4. Move from pos15 to pos25 (dirright). This makes pos15 clear and pos25 not clear.
5. Move from pos25 to pos24 (dirup). This makes pos25 clear and pos24 not clear.
6. Move from pos24 to pos23 (dirup). This makes pos24 clear and pos23 not clear.
7. Move from pos23 to pos22 (dirup). This makes pos23 clear and pos22 not clear.
8. Move from pos22 to pos21 (dirup). This makes pos22 clear and pos21 not clear.
9. Move from pos21 to pos31 (dirright). This makes pos21 clear and pos31 not clear.
10. Move from pos31 to pos41 (dirright). This makes pos31 clear and pos41 not clear.
11. Move from pos41 to pos51 (dirright). This makes pos41 clear and pos51 not clear.
12. Move from pos51 to pos52 (dirdown). This makes pos51 clear and pos52 not clear.
13. Now, the player is at pos52 and the stone is at pos42. We can push the stone from pos52 to pos42 following direction dirleft. This would move the stone from pos42 to pos32. Let's use "pushtonongoal".
    pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos52 pos42 pos32 dirleft.
14. After the push, the player is at pos42 and the stone is at pos32.
15. Move from pos42 to pos41 (dirup). This makes pos42 clear and pos41 not clear.
16. Move from pos41 to pos31 (dirleft). This makes pos41 clear and pos31 not clear.
17. Move from pos31 to pos32 (dirdown). This makes pos31 clear and pos32 not clear.
18. Now, the player is at pos32 and the stone is at pos32. Hmm, this seems inconsistent. Let's trace again.
    
After the push in step 13, the player is at pos42 and the stone is at pos32. Now we have to find a way to push the stone from pos32 to the goal pos34.

But wait, the precondition for the push action says "Stone s is at location l_from", but step 18 says the player is at pos32 and the stone is also at pos32. This is inconsistent.

I made an error in my tracing. Let's revise.

After the push in step 13, the player is at pos42 and the stone is at pos32. We need to push the stone from pos32 to pos33, and then to pos34. But we need to find a way to get to the left or above the stone to push it to the right or down.

Let's resume from step 13:

13. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos52 pos42 pos32 dirleft.
14. After the push, the player is at pos42 and the stone is at pos32.
15. Move from pos42 to pos32 (dirup). Wait, this is not valid because pos32 is not clear (the stone is there).

It seems, to push the stone from pos32 to pos33, the player needs to be at pos31 (north of pos32) or at pos22 (west of pos32). Let's try to get to pos31:

14. After the push, the player is at pos42 and the stone is at pos32.
15. Move from pos42 to pos41 (dirup). This makes pos42 clear and pos41 not clear.
16. Move from pos41 to pos31 (dirleft). This makes pos41 clear and pos31 not clear.
17. Now, the player is at pos31 and the stone is at pos32. We can push the stone from pos31 to pos32 following direction dirdown. This would move the stone from pos32 to pos33. Let's use "pushtonongoal".
    pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos32 pos33 dirdown.
18. After the push, the player is at pos32 and the stone is at pos33.
19. Now, we need to push the stone from pos33 to pos34 (the goal). The player is at pos32 and the stone is at pos33. To push it right, the player needs to be at pos23 (west of pos33). Let's move there.
20. Move from pos32 to pos22 (dirleft). This makes pos32 clear and pos22 not clear.
21. Move from pos22 to pos23 (dirdown). This makes pos22 clear and pos23 not clear.
22. Now, the player is at pos23 and the stone is at pos33. We can push the stone from pos23 to pos33 following direction dirright. This would move the stone from pos33 to pos34. Since pos34 is a goal location, we'll use "pushtogoal".
    pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos33 pos34 dirright.

With this, the stone is at a goal location (pos34), which is the main goal. Let's check the constraints again:
- Location pos53 is clear throughout the plan.
- Location pos15 is not clear at some point (step 3).
- player1 is not at location pos43 throughout the plan.
- Location pos14 is not clear at some point (step 2).
- stone1 is not at location pos43 throughout the plan.

All constraints are satisfied. Let's summarize the plan:

1. move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown
2. move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown
3. move player1 pos14 pos15 dirdown
4. move player1 pos15 pos25 dirright
5. move player1 pos25 pos24 dirup
6. move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup
7. move player1 pos23 pos22 dirup
8. move player1 pos22 pos21 dirup
9. move player1 pos21 pos31 dirright
10. move player1 pos31 pos41 dirright
11. move player1 pos41 pos51 dirright
12. move player1 pos51 pos52 dirdown
13. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos52 pos42 pos32 dirleft
14. move player1 pos42 pos41 dirup
15. move player1 pos41 pos31 dirleft
16. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos32 pos33 dirdown
17. move player1 pos32 pos22 dirleft
18. move player1 pos22 pos23 dirdown
19. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos33 pos34 dirright

But actually, I just realized, there's a shorter and cleaner plan:

1. move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown
2. move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown
3. move player1 pos14 pos15 dirdown
4. move player1 pos15 pos25 dirright
5. move player1 pos25 pos35 dirright
6. move player1 pos35 pos45 dirright
7. move player1 pos45 pos44 dirup
8. move player1 pos44 pos34 dirleft
9. move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup
10. move player1 pos33 pos32 dirup
11. move player1 pos32 pos31 dirup
12. move player1 pos31 pos41 dirright
13. move player1 pos41 pos51 dirright
14. move player1 pos51 pos52 dirdown
15. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos52 pos42 pos32 dirleft
16. move player1 pos42 pos32 dirup
17. move player1 pos32 pos33 dirdown
18. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos34 dirright

But wait, step 16 contradicts my earlier analysis (the player is at pos42 and the stone is at pos32). The push action's effects say "agent p is at location l_from" after the action. So after the push in step 15, the player is at pos42 and the stone is at pos32.

Let's revisit the effect of pushtonongoal:
"pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": After performing this action, (i) agent p is no longer at location l_p, (ii) stone s is no longer at location l_from, (iii) location l_to is no longer clear, (iv) agent p is at location l_from, (v) stone s is at location l_to, (vi) location l_p is clear, and (vi) stone s is at a goal state.

So after step 15, the player is at pos42 (l_from), not at pos52 (l_p), and the stone is at pos32 (l_to).

Then, to move from pos42 to pos32 (where the stone is), is invalid because pos32 is not clear. Let's revise.

1. move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown
2. move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown
3. move player1 pos14 pos15 dirdown
4. move player1 pos15 pos25 dirright
5. move player1 pos25 pos35 dirright
6. move player1 pos35 pos45 dirright
7. move player1 pos45 pos44 dirup
8. move player1 pos44 pos34 dirleft
9. move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup
10. move player1 pos33 pos32 dirup
11. move player1 pos32 pos31 dirup
12. move player1 pos31 pos41 dirright
13. move player1 pos41 pos51 dirright
14. move player1 pos51 pos52 dirdown
15. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos52 pos42 pos32 dirleft
16. After step 15, the player is at pos42 and the stone is at pos32.
17. We need to push the stone from pos32 to pos33, and then to pos34.
18. To push the stone from pos32 to pos33, the player needs to be north or west of the stone. But that's challenging because the stone is at the top and the player is east of the stone.

Let's redefine our approach. Let's push the stone from the right, then from above.

1. move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown
2. move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown
3. move player1 pos14 pos15 dirdown
4. move player1 pos15 pos14 dirup
5. move player1 pos14 pos24 dirright
6. move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright
7. move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright
8. move player1 pos44 pos43 dirup
9. Hmm, this violates the constraint "player1 is not at location pos43". Let's revise.

Actually, the constraint that the player can't go to pos43 but the stone needs to go to pos34 makes this challenging. The player needs to push the stone from a position, but can't go to pos43.

After step 15 above, the player is at pos42 and the stone is at pos32. To push the stone from pos32 to pos33, the player needs to be north or west of the stone. The player is south-east of the stone. Let's try to get to pos22 (west of pos32):

16. move player1 pos42 pos41 dirup
17. move player1 pos41 pos31 dirleft
18. move player1 pos31 pos21 dirleft
19. move player1 pos21 pos22 dirdown
20. Now, the player is at pos22 and the stone is at pos32. We can push the stone from pos22 to pos32 following direction dirright. This would move the stone from pos32 to pos33. Let's use "pushtonongoal".
    pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos32 pos33 dirright
21. After the push, the player is at pos32 and the stone is at pos33.
22. To push the stone from pos33 to pos34, the player needs to be north or west of the stone. The player is west of the stone. Let's push:
    pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos33 pos34 dirright
23. After the push, the player is at pos33 and the stone is at pos34, which is a goal location. This meets the main goal.

Let's revise our final plan:

1. move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown
2. move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown
3. move player1 pos14 pos15 dirdown
4. move player1 pos15 pos25 dirright
5. move player1 pos25 pos35 dirright
6. move player1 pos35 pos45 dirright
7. move player1 pos45 pos44 dirup
8. move player1 pos44 pos34 dirleft
9. move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup
10. move player1 pos33 pos32 dirup
11. move player1 pos32 pos31 dirup
12. move player1 pos31 pos41 dirright
13. move player1 pos41 pos51 dirright
14. move player1 pos51 pos52 dirdown
15. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos52 pos42 pos32 dirleft
16. move player1 pos42 pos41 dirup
17. move player1 pos41 pos31 dirleft
18. move player1 pos31 pos21 dirleft
19. move player1 pos21 pos22 dirdown
20. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos32 pos33 dirright
21. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos33 pos34 dirright

Actually, there's a more direct approach. Since the stone starts at pos42, the player can just move to pos32 and push the stone down to pos43, and then to the goal pos34. But this violates the constraint that the stone can't be at pos43.

Is there any other shorter approach? Let's check:

Constraint "stone1 is not at location pos43" means we can't push the stone from pos42 to pos43. This means we need to move the stone in a different direction first, perhaps to pos32, and then to pos33 and finally to pos34 (the goal).

To push the stone from pos42 to pos32, the player needs to be east or south of the stone. Let's retrace:

1. move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown
2. move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown (satisfies pos14 constraint)
3. move player1 pos14 pos15 dirdown (satisfies pos15 constraint)
4. move player1 pos15 pos25 dirright
5. move player1 pos25 pos35 dirright
6. move player1 pos35 pos45 dirright
7. move player1 pos45 pos55 dirright
8. move player1 pos55 pos54 dirup
9. move player1 pos54 pos53 dirup
10. move player1 pos53 pos52 dirup
11. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos52 pos42 pos32 dirleft
12. After the push, the player is at pos42 and the stone is at pos32.
13. We need to push the stone from pos32 to pos33 and then to pos34.
14. To push the stone from pos32 to pos33, the player needs to be at pos22 or pos31. Let's move to pos22:
    move player1 pos42 pos32 dirup
    
Hmm, this is not valid because the stone is at pos32 and the location isn't clear. Let's reconsider.

After step 11, the player is at pos42 and the stone is at pos32. Let's move to pos22:

12. move player1 pos42 pos41 dirup
13. move player1 pos41 pos31 dirleft
14. move player1 pos31 pos21 dirleft
15. move player1 pos21 pos22 dirdown
16. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos32 pos33 dirright
17. After this push, the player is at pos32 and the stone is at pos33.
18. Now, to push the stone from pos33 to pos34, the player needs to be at pos23 or pos32. The player is already at pos32, so we can push the stone directly to pos34.
    pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos33 pos34 dirright
19. After this, the stone is at the goal, which is our objective.

Revising the plan:

1. move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown
2. move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown
3. move player1 pos14 pos15 dirdown
4. move player1 pos15 pos25 dirright
5. move player1 pos25 pos35 dirright
6. move player1 pos35 pos45 dirright
7. move player1 pos45 pos55 dirright
8. move player1 pos55 pos54 dirup
9. move player1 pos54 pos53 dirup
10. move player1 pos53 pos52 dirup
11. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos52 pos42 pos32 dirleft
12. move player1 pos42 pos41 dirup
13. move player1 pos41 pos31 dirleft
14. move player1 pos31 pos21 dirleft
15. move player1 pos21 pos22 dirdown
16. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos32 pos33 dirright
17. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos33 pos34 dirright

But there's a constraint that "Location pos53 is clear" at all times. In our plan, there's a step where the player moves from pos54 to pos53, making it not clear. Let's revise.

Here's an alternative: after step 11, instead of trying to go through pos53, we go through pos21:
12. move player1 pos42 pos32 dirup (but this isn't valid as pos32 is not clear because the stone is there).

Actually, let's revise the entire approach. As you suggested, the most direct approach would be to push the stone from pos42 to pos32, then pos33, and then pos34.

1. move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown
2. move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown (satisfies pos14 constraint)
3. move player1 pos14 pos15 dirdown (satisfies pos15 constraint)
4. move player1 pos15 pos25 dirright
5. move player1 pos25 pos35 dirright
6. move player1 pos35 pos45 dirright
7. move player1 pos45 pos44 dirup
8. move player1 pos44 pos43 dirup (violates the constraint "player1 is not at location pos43"). Hmm, we can't go through pos43.

Okay, let's approach this differently:

1. move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown
2. move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown (satisfies pos14 constraint)
3. move player1 pos14 pos15 dirdown (satisfies pos15 constraint)
4. move player1 pos15 pos25 dirright
5. move player1 pos25 pos35 dirright
6. move player1 pos35 pos45 dirright
7. move player1 pos45 pos55 dirright
8. move player1 pos55 pos54 dirup
9. move player1 pos54 pos44 dirleft
10. move player1 pos44 pos34 dirleft
11. move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft
12. move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup
13. move player1 pos23 pos22 dirup
14. move player1 pos22 pos21 dirup
15. move player1 pos21 pos31 dirright
16. move player1 pos31 pos41 dirright
17. move player1 pos41 pos51 dirright
18. move player1 pos51 pos52 dirdown
19. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos52 pos42 pos32 dirleft
20. After this push, the player is at pos42 and the stone is at pos32.
21. move player1 pos42 pos41 dirup
22. move player1 pos41 pos31 dirleft
23. move player1 pos31 pos21 dirleft
24. move player1 pos21 pos22 dirdown
25. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos32 pos33 dirright
26. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos33 pos34 dirright

That seems overly complex. Let's rethink this.

1. move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown
2. move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown (satisfies pos14 constraint)
3. move player1 pos14 pos15 dirdown (satisfies pos15 constraint)
4. move player1 pos15 pos25 dirright
5. move player1 pos25 pos35 dirright
6. move player1 pos35 pos34 dirup
7. move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup
8. move player1 pos33 pos32 dirup
9. move player1 pos32 pos31 dirup
10. move player1 pos31 pos41 dirright
11. move player1 pos41 pos51 dirright
12. move player1 pos51 pos52 dirdown
13. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos52 pos42 pos32 dirleft
14. After this push, the player is at pos42 and the stone is at pos32.
15. move player1 pos42 pos41 dirup
16. move player1 pos41 pos31 dirleft
17. move player1 pos31 pos21 dirleft
18. move player1 pos21 pos22 dirdown
19. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos32 pos33 dirright
20. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos33 pos34 dirright

Actually, this approach is clean and optimal. Let's double-check:

- The player starts at pos12.
- The stone starts at pos42.
- The goal is to move the stone to a goal location, which is pos34.
- Constraints:
  - Location pos53 is clear throughout the plan. We don't visit pos53, so this is satisfied.
  - Location pos15 is not clear at some point. In step 3, the player moves to pos15, making it not clear. This is satisfied.
  - player1 is not at location pos43 at any point. The player never goes to pos43 in the plan, so this is satisfied.
  - Location pos14 is not clear at some point. In step 2, the player moves to pos14, making it not clear. This is satisfied.
  - stone1 is not at location pos43 at any point. The stone never goes to pos43 in the plan, so this is satisfied.

What about the effect of pushtonongoal and pushtogoal?

After pushtonongoal, the player is at the former position of the stone, and the stone is moved one position in the given direction. So in step 13, the player is at pos42 and the stone is at pos32.

After pushtogoal, the player is at the former position of the stone, and the stone is moved one position in the given direction. So in step 20, the player is at pos33 and the stone is at pos34.

This seems to satisfy all the constraints and our objective. The actions are also consistent with their descriptions. Let's go with this plan.
