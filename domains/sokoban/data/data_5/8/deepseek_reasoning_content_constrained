Okay, let's tackle this planning problem step by step. First, I need to understand the initial state and the goal. The agent (player1) starts at pos32, and stone1 is at pos24. The goal is to have stone1 on a goal location. From the initial state, the only goal location mentioned is pos14. So I need to get stone1 to pos14.

But there are several constraints to satisfy. Let's list them out:

1. pos34 must be blocked (not clear) in at most one continuous sequence. So we can't have pos34 occupied for more than a consecutive set of steps. Maybe moving through it once and then leaving would satisfy this.

2. The agent must be at pos34 at least once. So at some point, player1 needs to be there.

3. If the agent is at pos34, then stone1 must be at pos32 either at that state or later. Since stone1 starts at pos24, maybe after moving it towards pos14, but this might complicate things.

4. pos14 must be not clear in at least one state. Since pos14 is a goal location, once stone1 is placed there, pos14 will be occupied. So that's covered once we push the stone to pos14.

5. If pos14 is not clear (which will happen when stone1 is there), there must have been a prior state where pos31 was not clear. So pos31 must be occupied before we place the stone at pos14. pos31 is initially clear. So the agent or a stone must be at pos31 at some point before the stone is at pos14.

6. At least one of pos24 or pos54 must be not clear in some state. pos24 starts with stone1, so initially it's not clear. Wait, no—the initial state says "Location pos24 is clear". Wait, wait, looking back: The original state says "stone1 is at location pos24" and "Location pos24 is clear". Wait, that can't be right. Wait, if a stone is at pos24, then pos24 should not be clear. But the original state lists "Location pos24 is clear". That's a contradiction. Wait, maybe there's a mistake here. Let me check again.

Original state:
- "stone1 is at location pos24"
- "Location pos24 is clear"

Wait, that's impossible. If the stone is at pos24, then pos24 is not clear. This must be an error in the problem description. Or maybe I'm misunderstanding. Wait, perhaps "clear" means that the location is free for the agent to move into. But if a stone is there, then it's not clear for the agent. So the initial state says pos24 is clear, but stone1 is there? That's conflicting. Hmm, maybe the problem statement has a typo. Let me check again.

Looking at the original state:

Under "The original state of the world is the following":
- "stone1 is at location pos24"
- "Location pos24 is clear"

That's a conflict. So perhaps there's a mistake here. But maybe "clear" refers to being free for movement, but stones can be pushed. Wait, the problem says "Each position on the grid may contain either the agent, a stone or be empty." So if a stone is present, the location is not clear. Therefore, the initial state says pos24 has a stone but is clear, which is impossible. This must be an error. Wait, maybe the initial state lists "Location pos24 is clear" but actually, since the stone is there, it's not. Maybe the problem has a typo, and "Location pos24 is clear" is a mistake. Let me check the problem again.

Wait, looking at the list of original state:

Under "The original state of the world is the following":
...
"Location pos22 is clear"
"Location pos23 is clear"
"Location pos25 is clear"
...
"Location pos24 is clear"

But also "stone1 is at location pos24". So this is a contradiction. That must be a mistake in the problem. But assuming that the problem is correct as given, perhaps the stone is at pos24, but the location is considered clear. That doesn't make sense. Maybe the problem has a typo, and the stone is actually at another location. Alternatively, perhaps "clear" refers to something else. But according to the problem's description, each position may contain the agent, a stone, or be empty. So if a stone is present, the location is not clear. Therefore, the initial state has an inconsistency. But since this is part of the problem, I have to work with it as given. Wait, maybe the stone is at pos24, but the location is considered clear because the agent can push it. No, that's not how the problem defines clear. The preconditions for pushing actions require that the location to be pushed into (l_to) is clear. So if a stone is at l_from (pos24), then the agent can push it to l_to only if l_to is clear. But in the initial state, the stone is at pos24, so pos24 should not be clear. So the problem's initial state is conflicting. This is a problem. Maybe the user made a typo. Let me check the initial state again.

Original state:
- "stone1 is at location pos24"
- "Location pos24 is clear"

This is impossible. Therefore, perhaps the stone is actually at pos24, making pos24 not clear, but the problem mistakenly lists it as clear. Or maybe the stone is at another location. Wait, perhaps I misread. Let me check again. The original state says "stone1 is at location pos24" and "Location pos24 is clear". That's a contradiction. So this must be a mistake. But as a solver, I have to proceed with the given information. Maybe the user intended that pos24 is not clear, but the initial state has a typo. Alternatively, maybe "clear" refers to something else, like no obstacles, but allowing stones. But according to the problem's action preconditions, for example, "move" requires that l_to is clear. So if a stone is at l_to, you can't move there. Therefore, the initial state is inconsistent. This is a problem. But perhaps the correct initial state is that pos24 is not clear because the stone is there. The problem might have a typo. Let me check all the "Location is clear" statements. In the original state, the list includes "Location pos24 is clear", but also states that stone1 is at pos24. That's conflicting. Therefore, this is likely a mistake in the problem. But since I have to proceed, I'll assume that the stone is actually at pos24, making pos24 not clear, and the "Location pos24 is clear" is a typo. Otherwise, the problem is impossible. Alternatively, maybe the stone is at a different location. Wait, the original state says "stone1 is at location pos24", so I have to take that as correct. Therefore, the problem's initial state is invalid. But since the problem is given as such, perhaps I should proceed under the assumption that despite the stone being at pos24, pos24 is considered clear. That would be contradictory to the problem's own definitions. Alternatively, maybe "clear" means something else. This is confusing. Wait, maybe "clear" for a location means that there's no agent there. But the problem states that a location can contain agent, stone, or be empty. So if a stone is there, the location is not clear. Therefore, the initial state is invalid. But perhaps it's a typo, and the stone is at pos34 instead? Or maybe pos24 is supposed to be clear, and the stone is elsewhere. But according to the problem, the stone is at pos24. Hmm. This is a problem. Since the problem states that, I have to work with it, but this might affect the solution.

Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in listing pos24 as clear. Let's proceed under the assumption that the stone is at pos24, making pos24 not clear. Therefore, the initial state's statement that pos24 is clear is incorrect, but that's part of the problem. Wait, no—preconditions for actions depend on the actual state. For example, to push a stone from pos24, the agent needs to be adjacent. So perhaps the initial state is correct, but the stone's presence at pos24 makes pos24 not clear. But according to the problem, the user has listed pos24 as clear. So this is a conflict. Therefore, the problem is impossible unless there's a misunderstanding.

Wait, perhaps "Location posX is clear" means that the agent is not there. But the stone can be there. So maybe "clear" refers to the agent's presence. That would make sense. So if a location is clear, the agent is not there, but there might be a stone. So in the initial state, the agent is at pos32, which is clear? Wait, the initial state says "Location pos32 is clear". But the agent is at pos32. So that's a contradiction. Therefore, the problem's definition of "clear" must be that a location is clear if it does not contain the agent. Because in the original state, the agent is at pos32, but pos32 is listed as clear. So that can't be. Wait, the initial state says:

"player1 is at location pos32"

"Location pos32 is clear"

So that's conflicting. Therefore, the problem's initial state is invalid. But how can this be? This must be a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps "clear" means that there's no stone. But the problem says a location can have agent, stone, or be empty. So "clear" could mean empty. But if that's the case, then if the agent is at a location, it's not clear. So the initial state has a contradiction: player1 is at pos32, but pos32 is clear. Therefore, the problem is ill-defined. This is a major issue. But since this is a planning problem given by the user, perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the definitions. Let me re-examine the problem's action effects.

For the "move" action, the effect is that the agent leaves l_from (making it clear) and moves to l_to (making it not clear). So when the agent is at a location, that location is not clear. Therefore, in the initial state, pos32 is not clear because the agent is there. But the problem lists "Location pos32 is clear" in the original state. That's a contradiction. So this is a problem in the problem statement. Without resolving this, the problem can't be solved. Therefore, perhaps the user made a mistake in the initial state. But since I have to proceed, perhaps I should adjust the initial state to fix this inconsistency. Let's assume that "Location pos32 is clear" is a mistake and should be "Location pos32 is not clear". Then, the agent is at pos32, making it not clear. Similarly, pos24 is clear (no agent, but stone1 is there. So if "clear" refers to the presence of the agent, then a location with a stone is considered clear. That would make sense. Let me recheck the problem's definitions.

The problem says: Each position on the grid may contain either the agent, a stone or be empty. So a location can have either agent, stone, or be empty. So "clear" probably refers to the absence of both agent and stone. Wait, no. Because when the agent moves to a location, that location becomes not clear. So "clear" means that the location is empty. So if a location has a stone or the agent, it's not clear. Therefore, in the initial state, pos24 has a stone, so it's not clear, but the problem says "Location pos24 is clear". Contradiction. Similarly, pos32 has the agent, so it's not clear, but the problem says "Location pos32 is clear". Contradiction. Therefore, the initial state is impossible.

But given that this is the problem as presented, perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the definition of "clear". Let me check the action preconditions again. For the "move" action, the preconditions are that the agent is at l_from, l_to is clear, and movement is possible. So if the agent wants to move to l_to, l_to must be clear (i.e., no agent or stone there). Therefore, "clear" means that the location is empty. So in the initial state, pos32 has the agent, so it's not clear. But the problem states "Location pos32 is clear". That's a mistake. Same with pos24. Therefore, the problem has an invalid initial state. Without fixing this, the problem is unsolvable. Since this is part of the given problem, perhaps the user intended that "clear" refers to something else. Alternatively, perhaps "clear" for a location with a stone is considered clear if there's no agent. But according to the problem's action preconditions, to push a stone from l_from, the agent must be at l_p (adjacent to l_from). So the agent can't be on the same location as the stone. Therefore, a location can't have both agent and stone. So in that case, "clear" could mean that the location is free of the agent. So a location with a stone is considered clear for the purpose of the agent moving into it? That doesn't make sense. Because pushing a stone requires the agent to be adjacent, not on the same tile as the stone. So in that case, the stone's location is not clear for the agent to move into. Therefore, the initial state is incorrect. 

This is a critical issue. Given the time constraints, perhaps I should proceed under the assumption that the problem's initial state has typos, and correct them as follows:

- The agent is at pos32, so pos32 is not clear. Therefore, the original state's line "Location pos32 is clear" should be removed or negated.

- The stone is at pos24, so pos24 is not clear. Therefore, the original state's line "Location pos24 is clear" is incorrect and should be removed.

Assuming these corrections, let's proceed. Otherwise, the problem is impossible. So I'll adjust the initial state mentally:

Initial state:
- player1 at pos32 → pos32 is not clear.
- stone1 at pos24 → pos24 is not clear.
- All other locations are as per the original state (those listed as clear are clear).

With this correction, let's proceed.

Now, the goal is to get stone1 to a goal location. The only goal location listed is pos14. So we need to push stone1 from pos24 to pos14.

Constraints:

1. pos34 must be not clear in at most one continuous sequence. So pos34 can be occupied once, but not in multiple non-consecutive times.

2. player1 must be at pos34 at least once.

3. If player1 is at pos34, then stone1 must be at pos32 (current location or later). Wait, stone1 is initially at pos24, so after moving to pos34, we need to ensure that eventually stone1 is at pos32. But pos32 is the agent's starting position. Wait, but the stone can't be at pos32 unless pushed there. So this constraint implies that if the agent is ever at pos34, then stone1 must be moved to pos32 at some point after.

But our goal is to have stone1 at pos14. So this complicates things. So after moving the agent to pos34, we must arrange to push stone1 to pos32, which is a non-goal location. Then, perhaps push it again to pos14. But that seems to add steps. Let's see.

4. pos14 must be not clear in at least one state. Once we push stone1 to pos14, that's satisfied.

5. If pos14 is not clear (i.e., stone1 is there), then there must be an earlier state where pos31 was not clear. So pos31 must be occupied (by agent or another stone) before stone1 reaches pos14. But there's only one stone. So the agent must visit pos31 before pushing stone1 to pos14.

6. At least one of pos24 or pos54 must be not clear in some state. Initially, pos24 is not clear (stone1 is there). But according to the corrected initial state, pos24 is not clear. So this constraint is already satisfied in the initial state. But the problem's initial state may have pos24 as clear, but with the stone there. So perhaps this constraint is automatically satisfied once the stone is moved. Wait, but according to the problem's original (incorrect) state, pos24 is clear. So in reality, the stone is there, making it not clear. Therefore, this constraint is satisfied in the initial state. But since the problem's original state says pos24 is clear, perhaps the user intended that the stone is elsewhere. This is getting too confusing. Let's proceed with our corrected initial state where pos24 is not clear (stone there). Then, the constraint is satisfied in the initial state. However, the problem's original state lists "Location pos24 is clear", which would conflict. So perhaps in the problem's intended setup, pos24 is clear, but stone1 is not there. But the problem says stone1 is at pos24. This is a problem. 

Assuming that the initial state is correct (despite the contradiction), perhaps the user intended that "clear" refers to the presence of the agent only. So a location with a stone is considered clear. Then, the agent can move into a location with a stone? But according to the problem's actions, pushing a stone requires the agent to be adjacent. So this is conflicting. 

This is a significant issue, but perhaps I should proceed under the assumption that the initial state is correct as given, despite the contradictions, and that "clear" refers to the presence of the agent. So a location with a stone is considered clear for movement, but pushing requires the agent to be adjacent. Then, the agent can move into a location with a stone, which is impossible. But according to the move action's preconditions, l_to must be clear (i.e., no agent there). So perhaps "clear" means that the agent is not present. Therefore, a location can have a stone and still be clear (for the agent to move there). But that's impossible because the stone is occupying the location. This is conflicting. 

Given the time I've spent on this and the need to proceed, I'll assume that the initial state is correct, and that "clear" refers to the presence of the agent. So a location with a stone is considered clear for the purpose of the agent moving there. Therefore, the agent can move into a stone's location. But according to the problem's actions, pushing requires the agent to be adjacent. So perhaps the agent can move into the stone's location, but to push, the agent needs to be next to it. But that's not how pushing usually works. 

This is getting too stuck. Let's proceed with the given problem, assuming that the initial state is correct as stated, even if contradictory. Therefore, stone1 is at pos24, and pos24 is clear. So the agent can move into pos24, but the stone is there. This is impossible. Therefore, the problem is ill-defined, but perhaps there's a way around it. 

Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in the initial state, and the stone is at pos34, and pos24 is clear. But that's just speculation. 

Given the time constraints, I'll proceed under the assumption that the problem's initial state has typos, and the correct initial state is:

- stone1 is at pos24 → pos24 is not clear.

- agent is at pos32 → pos32 is not clear.

The other locations are as listed. So pos24 is not clear (stone there), pos32 is not clear (agent there), others are clear as per the problem's list.

Now, the goal is to get stone1 to a goal location (pos14).

Constraints:

1. pos34 must be not clear in at most one continuous sequence. So pos34 can be occupied once, but not in multiple separate times.

2. agent must be at pos34 at least once.

3. If agent is at pos34, then stone1 must be at pos32 (either at that state or after). Since stone1 starts at pos24, we need to push it to pos32 at some point after the agent is at pos34.

4. pos14 must be not clear in at least one state. Once stone1 is there, that's satisfied.

5. Before pos14 is not clear (stone1 there), pos31 must have been not clear. So agent must be at pos31 or a stone there. But there's only one stone. So agent must visit pos31 before pushing stone1 to pos14.

6. At least one of pos24 or pos54 must be not clear in some state. Initially, pos24 is not clear (stone there), so that's covered.

7. agent must be at pos33 at least once.

8. If agent is at pos33, then either pos35 is not clear or stone1 is at pos43 at that state or after.

Now, let's plan the steps.

First, need to get the agent to pos34 to satisfy constraint 2. Then, after that, ensure stone1 is at pos32.

But to push stone1 from pos24 to pos14, the agent needs to get to a position adjacent to pos24. The possible directions for pushing depend on the allowed movements.

Looking at the allowed movements for pos24: from pos24, you can go to pos14 (dirleft), pos34 (dirright), pos23 (dirup), pos25 (dirdown). So the agent can approach pos24 from pos23 (north), pos34 (east), pos14 (west), or pos25 (south). But pos24 is initially occupied by stone1. So the agent must be at a neighboring location to push the stone.

For example, to push the stone from pos24 to pos14 (west direction), the agent needs to be at pos24's east neighbor (pos34) and then push west. Wait, no: to push a stone from l_from to l_to, the agent must be at l_p, which is adjacent to l_from in the direction towards l_to. For example, to push the stone west from pos24 to pos14, the agent must be east of pos24 (pos34), move into pos24 (pushing the stone west to pos14). Wait, the action "pushtogoal" requires that the agent is at l_p (adjacent to l_from) in the direction of d. For example, if the agent is at pos34 (east of pos24), direction dirleft (west), then l_p is pos34, l_from is pos24, l_to is pos14. But the movement direction from l_p to l_from must be possible. So for the agent to push from pos24 to pos14 (west), the agent must be at pos34 (east of pos24) and move west to pos24, pushing the stone to pos14. But according to the allowed movements, from pos34, can the agent move to pos24? Looking at the allowed moves:

"You may move from location pos34 to location pos24 following direction dirleft"

Yes. So the agent can move from pos34 to pos24 (dirleft), but pos24 has the stone. So to push, the agent uses the pushtogoal action: agent is at pos34 (l_p), stone is at pos24 (l_from), pushes to pos14 (l_to) with direction dirleft.

But wait, the action "pushtogoal" requires that l_to is a goal location. pos14 is a goal location, so that's okay.

But first, the agent needs to get to pos34. The agent starts at pos32.

Path from pos32 to pos34:

pos32 → pos33 (dirdown) → pos34 (dirdown).

So move from pos32 to pos33: direction dirdown. Then pos33 to pos34: dirdown.

But before moving, need to ensure that the path is clear.

pos32 to pos33: check if pos33 is clear. Initially, pos33 is clear. So move player1 from pos32 to pos33 dirdown.

Then, pos33 to pos34: pos34 is clear. So move again.

So:

Action 1: move player1 pos32 pos33 dirdown

Action 2: move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown

Now, the agent is at pos34, satisfying constraint 2. Now, according to constraint 3, since the agent is at pos34, stone1 must be at pos32 at some state after this. But the stone is at pos24. So after this, we need to push stone1 to pos32.

But how? To push stone1 from pos24 to pos32, the agent needs to be adjacent to pos24. Let's see. pos24's neighbors are pos23 (north), pos25 (south), pos14 (west), pos34 (east). The agent is currently at pos34. So agent can push stone1 from pos24 to pos34's direction. Wait, no. To push the stone east to pos34, but pos34 is now occupied by the agent. So that's not possible. Alternatively, push the stone north to pos23, south to pos25, or west to pos14.

But our goal is to get the stone to pos14 (west). But according to constraint 3, after the agent is at pos34, stone1 must be at pos32. So after being at pos34, we need to get stone1 to pos32.

So perhaps after moving to pos34, we need to push the stone to pos34 (east from pos24 to pos34), but that would require the agent to be at pos34's east (pos44) to push west. But pos34 is occupied by the agent. So that's not possible. Alternatively, maybe the agent can move around to push the stone to pos32.

Wait, pos32 is the agent's starting position. To push the stone to pos32, the stone would have to come from pos31 (north) or pos33 (south) or pos22 (west) or pos42 (east). But the stone is at pos24. To get it to pos32, need a path. 

Alternatively, the agent can push the stone from pos24 to pos23 (north), then pos23 to pos22 (west), then pos22 to pos32 (south). But that's a long path. But given the constraints, maybe necessary.

Alternatively, after being at pos34 (action 2), the agent needs to move to pos24 (but pos24 has the stone, which is not clear. So the agent can't move there unless pushing. So maybe after action 2, the agent is at pos34, and can push the stone from pos24 to pos14 (west), which is a goal location. But then the stone is at pos14, achieving the goal. But this violates constraint 3, which requires that after the agent is at pos34, the stone must be at pos32. So if we push the stone to pos14 (goal) immediately after being at pos34, the constraint is violated because the stone is not at pos32. Therefore, we need to first push the stone to pos32 after being at pos34.

So how to do that:

First, after being at pos34, the agent needs to move to a position where it can push the stone towards pos32. Let's see:

The stone is at pos24. To get it to pos32, the path would be:

pos24 → pos34 (east) → pos44 (east) → but that's away from pos32. Alternatively, push north to pos23, then west to pos22, then south to pos32.

But that's a longer path. Let's think.

After agent is at pos34 (action 2), he can push the stone east to pos34, but pos34 is occupied by the agent. So that's not possible. Therefore, the agent must move from pos34 to another location to push the stone.

For example, agent moves from pos34 to pos33 (dirup). Then, from pos33, can push the stone from pos24 to pos23 (north). But pos33 is south of pos24? No. pos24 is at row 2, column4. pos33 is row3, column3. So how to reach pos24 from pos33. The allowed movements from pos33: can move to pos23 (dirleft), pos43 (dirright), pos32 (dirup), pos34 (dirdown).

So agent is at pos33. To reach a position adjacent to pos24, he needs to go to pos23 (north of pos24). So from pos33, move to pos23 (dirleft). But pos23 is initially clear. So:

Action 3: move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup

Action 4: move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft

Now, agent is at pos23. From here, the stone is at pos24 (east). So agent can push the stone north from pos24 to pos23? No, pos24 is east of pos23. To push the stone west from pos24 to pos23, the agent needs to be east of pos24 (pos34), but that's not the case. Alternatively, agent at pos23 can push the stone south from pos24 to pos25 (dirdown), but that's not helpful. 

Wait, the agent is at pos23. The stone is at pos24 (east of pos23). The direction from pos23 to pos24 is dirright (east). So to push the stone from pos24 to pos23 (west), the agent would need to be east of pos24 (pos34) and push west. But the agent is at pos23, which is west of pos24. To push the stone west from pos24 to pos23, the agent must be east of pos24 (pos34), which is not the case. So the agent at pos23 can't push the stone west. Instead, he can push it south from pos24 to pos25, but that's moving away from the goal.

Alternatively, the agent needs to move to pos34 again to push the stone west to pos14. But then, after pushing, the stone is at pos14, achieving the goal. But this would violate constraint 3, because after being at pos34, the stone must be at pos32. So this approach won't work.

Alternative approach: After being at pos34 (action 2), the agent must move to pos31 to satisfy constraint 5. Because constraint 5 says that before pos14 is not clear (stone there), pos31 must have been not clear. So agent needs to visit pos31 before pushing the stone to pos14.

So agent needs to go to pos31. Path from pos34 to pos31:

pos34 → pos33 (dirup) → pos32 (dirup) → pos31 (dirleft).

Wait:

pos34 to pos33: dirup.

pos33 to pos32: dirup.

pos32 to pos31: dirleft (since pos31 is west of pos32? No, pos31 is north-west of pos32. Wait, the grid positions are labeled posXY where X is row and Y is column. So pos31 is row3, column1; pos32 is row3, column2. So to move from pos32 to pos31, direction dirleft (since column decreases by 1). So allowed movements:

Looking at the allowed moves for pos32:

"You may move from location pos32 to location pos22 following direction dirleft"

Wait, no. The allowed moves from pos32 are:

- to pos22 (dirleft)

- to pos42 (dirright)

- to pos31 (dirup)

- to pos33 (dirdown)

Wait, according to the problem's allowed moves:

"You may move from location pos32 to location pos22 following direction dirleft"

"You may move from location pos32 to location pos42 following direction dirright"

"You may move from location pos32 to location pos31 following direction dirup"

"You may move from location pos32 to location pos33 following direction dirdown"

So from pos32, dirup goes to pos31.

So path from pos34 to pos31:

Action 3: move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup

Action 4: move player1 pos33 pos32 dirup

Action 5: move player1 pos32 pos31 dirup

Now, agent is at pos31. This satisfies that pos31 is not clear (agent there), which is needed for constraint 5. Now, before pushing the stone to pos14 (which will make pos14 not clear), pos31 was not clear. So this meets constraint 5.

Now, the agent needs to get back to a position where he can push the stone to pos14.

The stone is still at pos24. To push it to pos14, the agent needs to be east of pos24 (pos34) and push west. So agent needs to get to pos34.

From pos31, the agent can move to pos21 (dirleft?), wait:

Allowed moves from pos31:

"You may move from location pos31 to location pos21 following direction dirleft"

"You may move from location pos31 to location pos41 following direction dirright"

"You may move from location pos31 to location pos32 following direction dirdown"

So to get to pos34, agent needs to go:

pos31 → pos32 → pos33 → pos34.

So:

Action 6: move player1 pos31 pos32 dirdown

Action 7: move player1 pos32 pos33 dirdown

Action 8: move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown

Now, agent is back at pos34. But this is the second time visiting pos34, which may violate constraint 1 if the previous visit was in actions 2 and now again in action 8, making pos34 not clear in two separate sequences. But constraint 1 says pos34 must be not clear in at most one continuous sequence. So the agent's visits to pos34 in actions 2 and 8 would create two separate sequences where pos34 is not clear. This would violate the constraint. Therefore, we need to avoid multiple visits to pos34 unless they are consecutive.

Hmm, this complicates things. So the agent's first visit to pos34 is actions 1-2 (move to pos34), then leaves, and later returns in actions 6-8. This would create two separate sequences where pos34 is occupied, violating constraint 1.

Therefore, we need to ensure that all visits to pos34 are in a single continuous sequence. So after the first visit, the agent must not leave and return to pos34 again. But how to achieve the required steps.

Alternative approach: After the first visit to pos34 (action 2), the agent stays in pos34 until all necessary actions involving pos34 are done. But that's not possible since the agent needs to move to pos31.

Alternatively, combine the visits to pos34 into a single continuous block. Let's think.

The agent is at pos34 (action 2). To satisfy constraint 3, after being at pos34, the stone must be at pos32. So while at pos34, the agent can't push the stone to pos14 (goal) because that would move the stone away from pos32. So the agent must push the stone to pos32 after leaving pos34.

But how?

Wait, after action 2 (agent at pos34), he needs to move to pos31 (to satisfy constraint 5), but that requires leaving pos34, which would create a non-continuous sequence if he returns later.

This is getting too complicated. Let's try to structure the plan step by step, considering all constraints.

Plan outline:

1. Move agent to pos34 to satisfy constraint 2.

2. From pos34, push the stone to pos14 (goal). But this violates constraint 3 because after being at pos34, stone1 must be at pos32.

3. Alternatively, after being at pos34, move to pos31 to satisfy constraint 5, then push the stone to pos14.

But then constraint 3 is violated because after being at pos34, the stone is not at pos32.

So another approach: After being at pos34, the agent must arrange to push the stone to pos32.

But how? The stone is at pos24. To push it to pos32, the agent needs to push it south to pos25, then west to pos15, but that's away from pos32. Alternatively, push west to pos14 (goal), but that's the desired goal, but then constraint 3 is not met.

This is a dilemma. Maybe the constraints require that after the agent is at pos34, the stone must eventually be at pos32. So even if the stone is later moved to pos14, as long as it reaches pos32 after pos34.

But how to push it from pos24 to pos32:

pos24 → pos34 → pos44 → ... Not helpful. Alternative path: pos24 → pos23 → pos22 → pos32.

So agent needs to push the stone from pos24 to pos23 (north), then from pos23 to pos22 (west), then from pos22 to pos32 (south).

But this requires several pushes. Let's outline:

After agent is at pos34 (action 2), he moves to pos33 (action3), then to pos23 (action4). From pos23, he can push the stone north to pos23 (but stone is at pos24; to push west, the agent needs to be east of pos24 (pos34) again. Not possible.

Alternative, agent at pos23 can push the stone south to pos25. Then, agent moves to pos25 and pushes west to pos24, but this isn't helpful.

Alternatively, agent at pos23 can push the stone west to pos23 (from pos24 to pos23). But for that, the agent must be east of pos24 (pos34), not west.

This is getting too tangled. Maybe we need to accept that after being at pos34, the stone must be pushed to pos32, even if it requires a detour.

So after action 2 (agent at pos34), he pushes the stone to pos34 (east from pos24 to pos34). But pos34 is occupied by the agent. So that's not possible. So the agent must move away from pos34 to allow the stone to be pushed there.

Wait, maybe the agent moves from pos34 to pos44 (dirright), then pushes the stone east to pos34. But pos34 is now clear (agent moved to pos44). So:

Action3: move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright

Then, agent can push the stone from pos24 to pos34 (dirright):

pushtonongoal (since pos34 is not a goal location). But pos34 is not a goal location. So we need to use pushtonongoal.

Action4: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos24 pos34 dirright

This moves the stone from pos24 to pos34, and the agent to pos24. But pos34 is now occupied by the stone. However, this would make pos34 not clear, but we need to ensure that this is part of a single continuous sequence.

After this, the stone is at pos34. Now, the agent is at pos24. Now, to push the stone from pos34 to pos44 (dirright), but pos44 is not a goal. Alternatively, push it west to pos24 (dirleft), but pos24 is now clear (agent moved to pos24 in action4). Wait, after action4, the agent is at pos24. Then, he can push the stone west from pos34 to pos24 (dirleft), but pos24 is now clear.

But pos34 is a non-goal location. So pushtonongoal again:

Action5: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos34 pos44 dirright → but agent is at pos24, and pos34 is east of pos24. To push pos34's stone east to pos44, the agent must be west of pos34 (pos24) and push east. So yes.

Wait, the action requires that the agent is at l_p (adjacent to l_from in the direction of d). So for pushing from pos34 to pos44 (dirright), the agent must be west of pos34 (pos24) and move east to pos34, pushing the stone to pos44. But the agent is at pos24. Can he move east to pos34? Yes, if pos34 is clear. After action4, pos34 has the stone, so it's not clear. So the agent can't move there. Therefore, this approach won't work.

This is getting very complicated. Perhaps we need to find another way.

Alternative approach: 

To satisfy constraint 3, after the agent is at pos34, the stone must be at pos32. So after visiting pos34, the agent must push the stone to pos32. 

How to push the stone from pos24 to pos32:

Possible path: pos24 → pos23 → pos22 → pos32.

To do this:

1. Agent moves to pos23 (north of pos24) to push the stone west to pos23.

But to push west from pos24 to pos23, the agent must be east of pos24 (pos34) and push west. So agent at pos34 can push to pos23.

Wait, no. To push from pos24 to pos23 (west), the agent must be east of pos24 (pos34), direction dirleft (west). So:

Action3: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos24 pos23 dirleft

But pos23 is not a goal location. This action moves the stone from pos24 to pos23, agent moves to pos24.

Now, stone is at pos23.

Next, agent needs to push it from pos23 to pos22 (west). So agent must be east of pos23 (pos24) and push west.

Action4: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos23 pos22 dirleft

Stone moves to pos22, agent moves to pos23.

Then, push from pos22 to pos32 (south). Agent must be north of pos22 (pos12) but pos12 is clear. So agent needs to get to pos12.

This is getting too long, but perhaps necessary.

But this approach involves multiple pushes, which may take many steps and possibly violate the continuous pos34 constraint.

Alternatively, after being at pos34 (action2), the agent moves to pos33 (action3), then to pos32 (action4), then to pos22 (action5), then push the stone from pos24 to pos23, etc. But this is getting too time-consuming.

Given the time I've spent and the complexity, perhaps the optimal plan is as follows, ensuring all constraints:

1. Move agent from pos32 to pos33 (dirdown).

2. Move agent from pos33 to pos34 (dirdown). Now at pos34 (constraint2).

3. Move agent from pos34 to pos33 (dirup).

4. Move agent from pos33 to pos32 (dirup).

5. Move agent from pos32 to pos31 (dirup). Now at pos31 (satisfies constraint5 when pos31 is not clear).

6. Move agent from pos31 to pos32 (dirdown).

7. Move agent from pos32 to pos33 (dirdown).

8. Move agent from pos33 to pos34 (dirdown). Now back at pos34 (but this creates a second sequence of pos34 being not clear, violating constraint1).

This is a problem. So must find a way to visit pos34 once, then handle the stone.

Alternative plan:

1. Move to pos34 (actions1-2).

2. Push stone from pos24 to pos14 (goal), using pushtogoal. This would achieve the goal but violate constraint3 because after being at pos34, the stone is not at pos32.

Thus, constraint3 is violated.

Alternatively, after pushing to pos14, move the stone back to pos32. But that's counterproductive.

Alternatively, first push the stone to pos32, then to pos14.

But how to push from pos24 to pos32:

Pos24 → pos23 → pos22 → pos32.

Steps:

After agent is at pos34 (action2), he moves to pos23 (action3-4):

Action3: move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup.

Action4: move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft.

Then, push stone from pos24 to pos23 (action5: pushtonongoal, since pos23 is not a goal).

Action5: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos24 pos23 dirleft? No, the direction from pos23 to pos24 is dirright (east). To push west, agent must be east of pos24 (pos34). So this isn't possible.

Alternatively, agent at pos23 can't push stone from pos24. So agent must go to pos34 again.

Action3: move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft (but pos24 has stone, so can't move there. Must push.

Action3: pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos24 pos14 dirleft. This pushes the stone to pos14, achieving the goal. But this violates constraint3 because after being at pos34, stone1 is at pos14, not pos32.

Thus, this approach doesn't work.

This seems like a dead end. Given the time I've spent and the complexity, perhaps the optimal plan is to accept that constraint3 requires the stone to be at pos32 after agent is at pos34, so the plan must include moving the stone to pos32 after visiting pos34.

Therefore:

1. Move agent to pos34 (actions1-2).

2. Move agent to pos33, pos32, pos31 (to satisfy constraint5).

3. Push stone from pos24 to pos23, then to pos22, then to pos32.

4. Then push stone from pos32 to pos42, etc., to finally pos14.

But this would be a very long plan. However, considering the constraints, it's necessary.

Alternatively, after pushing the stone to pos32, then push it to pos14 via pos22, pos23, etc.

But this is getting too long. Perhaps the optimal plan is as follows, fulfilling all constraints:

Action1: move player1 pos32 pos33 dirdown

Action2: move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown (now at pos34, constraint2 met)

Action3: move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup

Action4: move player1 pos33 pos32 dirup

Action5: move player1 pos32 pos31 dirup (now at pos31, pos31 not clear, satisfying constraint5's precondition)

Action6: move player1 pos31 pos32 dirdown

Action7: move player1 pos32 pos22 dirleft (since allowed moves from pos32 to pos22 dirleft)

Action8: move player1 pos22 pos23 dirdown

Action9: move player1 pos23 pos24 dirdown (but pos24 has stone, so need to push)

Action9: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos24 pos34 dirright (pushes stone to pos34, a non-goal)

Action10: move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright (to clear pos34 for constraint1's continuous sequence)

Action11: pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos34 pos14 dirleft (pushes from pos34 to pos14)

But this way, after action2, agent is at pos34, then leaves, comes back in action10. This violates constraint1 because pos34 is not clear in two separate sequences.

Alternatively, after action2, agent stays in pos34 until action10.

But this requires pos34 to be occupied continuously from action2 to action10. But actions3-10 involve leaving pos34, which breaks the continuous sequence.

This is very challenging. Given the time constraints, I'll proceed to outline a plan that attempts to satisfy all constraints, even if it's suboptimal. The key points are:

- Agent must visit pos34 once.

- Agent must visit pos33 once.

- After visiting pos34, stone must be at pos32 eventually.

- pos31 must be visited before pos14 is occupied.

- pos14 must be occupied by stone.

- At least one of pos24 or pos54 must be not clear (pos24 initially, but if moved, pos54 must be occupied).

Given all this, here's a possible plan:

1. Move agent from pos32 to pos33 (dirdown).

2. Move to pos34 (dirdown). Now at pos34 (constraint2 met).

3. Move back to pos33 (dirup).

4. Move to pos32 (dirup).

5. Move to pos31 (dirup). Now pos31 is occupied (constraint5 met).

6. Move back to pos32 (dirdown).

7. Move to pos33 (dirdown).

8. Move to pos34 (dirdown). Now at pos34 again (violates constraint1 if this is a separate sequence).

But to avoid violating constraint1, agent must not leave pos34 once entered until the sequence is done. But how?

Alternative plan:

1. Move agent to pos33.

2. Move to pos34.

3. Push stone to pos14 (goal).

This would achieve the goal but violate constraint3.

But given the time, perhaps the optimal plan is:

```
move player1 pos32 pos33 dirdown
move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown
pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos24 pos14 dirleft
```

This plan has three actions. But does it violate any constraints?

Constraint3: If agent is at pos34, then stone must be at pos32 or after. But in this plan, after being at pos34, the stone is pushed to pos14. So it violates constraint3.

Thus, invalid.

Alternative plan:

1. Move to pos34.

2. Move to pos33.

3. Move to pos23.

4. Push stone to pos23.

5. Push stone to pos22.

6. Push stone to pos32.

7. Move to pos31.

8. Move back to push stone to pos14.

But this is long. Let's write it out:

Action1: move player1 pos32 pos33 dirdown

Action2: move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown (constraint2 met)

Action3: move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup

Action4: move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft

Action5: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos24 pos23 dirleft (pushes stone west from pos24 to pos23. But the agent must be at l_p adjacent to l_from in direction d. pos23 is west of pos24. To push west, agent must be east of pos24 (pos34). So this isn't possible.

Thus, invalid.

Another approach:

After action2 (agent at pos34), push stone to pos34:

Action3: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos24 pos34 dirright (but pos34 is occupied by agent. Can't push there.

Alternative, agent moves to pos44 first:

Action3: move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright

Action4: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos24 pos34 dirleft (pushes stone from pos24 to pos34)

Now, stone is at pos34 (non-goal). Agent is at pos24.

Action5: move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup

Action6: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos34 pos33 dirup (pushes stone north to pos33)

Action7: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos33 pos32 dirup (invalid, since stone must be at l_from pos33).

This is not working.

Given the time I've spent and the complexity, I'll proceed to provide a plan that attempts to meet all constraints, even if it's not optimal. However, given the time, perhaps the correct answer is:

```
move player1 pos32 pos33 dirdown
move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown
pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos24 pos14 dirleft
```

But this violates constraint3. Therefore, the answer is not valid.

Alternatively, after moving to pos34, the agent must push the stone to pos32. But how?

It's possible that the problem's constraints are such that pushing the stone to pos14 after visiting pos34 is allowed if the stone is later moved to pos32. But that seems unlikely.

Given the time constraints, I'll proceed with a plan that satisfies all constraints, even if longer.
