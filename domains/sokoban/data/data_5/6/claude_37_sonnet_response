Let me break down the problem:

1. We have a 2D grid of 5x5 (from pos11 to pos55).
2. We have a player (player1) and a stone (stone1).
3. The goal is to move the stone to a goal position. Only pos54 is a goal position.
4. We have three types of actions:
   - "move": Move the player.
   - "pushtogoal": Push a stone to a goal position.
   - "pushtonongoal": Push a stone to a non-goal position.

The initial state is:
- player1 is at pos25
- stone1 is at pos44

Let's represent the grid for better visualization:

```
11 12 13 14 15
21 22 23 24 25 (player1)
31 32 33 34 35
41 42 43 44 (stone1) 45
51 52 53 54 (goal) 55
```

Now, let's understand the constraints:

1. At some point, player1 must be at either pos15 or pos43.
2. player1 can never be at pos24.
3. At some point, player1 must be at pos34.
4. Before player1 can be at pos34, either pos34 must not be clear, or stone1 must be at pos55.
5. At some point, player1 must be at pos44.
6. Before player1 can be at pos44, pos12 must not be clear.
7. pos24 can be not clear for at most one continuous sequence of states.

Let's think about the plan step by step:

We want to move stone1 from pos44 to the goal position pos54. The player starts at pos25 and stone1 is at pos44.

Looking at the constraints, we need to have player1 at pos44 at some point, but before that, pos12 must not be clear. Since pos12 starts as clear, we need to move something there.

However, the stone is at pos44, so we can't move it directly to pos12. We need to use the stone to block pos12 temporarily.

Let's try to outline a plan:

1. Player moves to a position where they can push the stone (pos34 seems good).
2. Player pushes the stone to the goal position pos54.

But with the constraints, it gets more complex. Let's see:

- Player1 needs to be at pos34 at some point, but before that, either pos34 must not be clear or stone1 must be at pos55.
- Player1 also needs to be at pos44 at some point, but before that, pos12 must not be clear.

If player1 is at pos34, they can push the stone from pos44 to pos54 (the goal). But the constraint says that before player1 can be at pos34, either pos34 must not be clear or stone1 must be at pos55.

Let's think about this in reverse:

1. We want to push stone1 from pos44 to pos54.
2. For that, player1 needs to be at pos34.
3. Before player1 can be at pos34, either pos34 must not be clear or stone1 must be at pos55.
4. Also, at some point, player1 must be at either pos15 or pos43.
5. Before player1 can be at pos44, pos12 must not be clear.

One way is to first move stone1 to pos55, then move player1 to pos34, and then push stone1 to pos54. But this seems inefficient if we can push stone1 directly to pos54.

Let's re-examine the constraint: "If expression 'player1 is at location pos34' holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: 'At least one of the following conditions is true: "Location pos34 is not clear", "stone1 is at location pos55"'"

This means that before player1 is at pos34, we must have had a state where either pos34 was not clear or stone1 was at pos55. 

So, one approach is to first move stone1 to pos34, then push it to another location, which would satisfy the condition "Location pos34 is not clear" in an earlier state. Then, player1 can go to pos34.

Similarly, for the constraint about pos44, we need to make pos12 not clear before player1 is at pos44. Since stone1 is initially at pos44, player1 would need to push it away from pos44 and then come back.

Let's try to devise a more concrete plan:

1. Player1 moves to pos35 from pos25.
2. Player1 moves to pos34 from pos35. (This doesn't violate the constraint yet as we haven't reached the state where player1 is at pos34.)
3. Player1 moves to pos43 from pos34. (This satisfies constraint 1)
4. Player1 moves to pos44 from pos43. (This violates constraint 6 unless we've made pos12 not clear before).

Actually, this approach doesn't seem to be working efficiently given the constraints. Let's take a step back and think about it differently.

Let me try to visualize the desired movement of the stone:

1. The stone needs to move from pos44 to pos54 (the goal).
2. For this, the player needs to be at pos34 (to push the stone horizontally right).

Now, let's address the constraints:

1. Before player1 can be at pos34, either pos34 must not be clear or stone1 must be at pos55.
   - One approach is to first push stone1 to pos34 (from another position), then move it away, which would satisfy the condition "Location pos34 is not clear" in an earlier state.
   
2. Before player1 can be at pos44, pos12 must not be clear.
   - Since stone1 is initially at pos44, player1 would need to push it away from pos44 and then come back.

3. At some point, player1 must be at either pos15 or pos43.
   - We can incorporate this in our plan.

4. player1 can never be at pos24.
   - We need to ensure our movements avoid pos24.

Let's develop a more concrete plan, thinking about the constraints one by one:

1. First, make pos12 not clear by pushing stone1 there (from its initial position at pos44). This addresses constraint 6.
2. Ensure that at some point, player1 is at either pos15 or pos43 (constraint 1).
3. Make sure that stone1 is at pos55 or pos34 is not clear at some point before player1 is at pos34 (constraint 4).
4. Push stone1 to the goal position pos54.
5. All the while, ensure player1 never goes to pos24 (constraint 2) and that pos24 is not clear for at most one continuous sequence of states (constraint 7).

Let's work out the details:

1. Player1 starts at pos25 and stone1 is at pos44.
2. Player1 moves to pos35 from pos25.
3. Player1 moves to pos45 from pos35.
4. Player1 moves to pos44 from pos45 (which requires pos12 to be not clear, which is a problem right now).

Actually, when a stone is pushed, the player stays at the position where the stone was. So, in the initial state, the only way to move the stone is for player1 to be at pos43, pos45, or pos34. Since player1 is at pos25, they need to move to one of these positions first.

Let's revise the plan:

1. Player1 starts at pos25 and stone1 is at pos44.
2. Player1 moves to pos35 from pos25.
3. Player1 moves to pos34 from pos35. (This might violate constraint 4 if we haven't had a state where pos34 is not clear or stone1 is at pos55.)
4. Player1 moves to pos43 from pos34. (This satisfies constraint 1)
5. Player1 moves to pos44 from pos43, pushing stone1 to pos45. (This violates constraint 6 unless we've made pos12 not clear before.)
6. Player1 moves to pos45, pushing stone1 to pos55.
7. Player1 moves to pos44 from pos55.
8. Player1 moves to pos43 from pos44.
9. Player1 moves to pos34 from pos43.
10. Player1 moves to pos44 from pos34, pushing stone1 to pos54 (the goal).

The constraint about pos12 not being clear before player1 is at pos44 is a challenge. We need to push stone1 to pos12, but since stone1 is at pos44, this seems hard to achieve.

Hmm, let's reconsider. The constraint 6 doesn't necessarily mean that the stone has to be on pos12. It just means that pos12 must not be clear. But the only way for a location to be not clear is if the player or the stone is there. Since we can't have both, I'm thinking the stone should be at pos12 before the player is at pos44.

Let's see if we can devise a plan:

I'm finding it hard to map out a continuous plan with all the constraints in place. Let's approach it step by step, and try to ensure each constraint is addressed:

First, I'll envision the final state where the stone is at goal position pos54. For this, the player must be at pos44 to push the stone horizontally right.

Constraint 6 says that before player1 can be at pos44, pos12 must not be clear. Let's handle this by pushing the stone to pos12 at the beginning of our plan.

Constraint 4 says that before player1 can be at pos34, either pos34 must not be clear or stone1 must be at pos55. One way to handle this is to ensure stone1 is at pos55 (or has been at pos55) before player1 is at pos34.

Constraint 3 says that at some point, player1 must be at pos34.

Constraint 1 says that at some point, player1 must be at either pos15 or pos43.

Constraint 2 says that player1 can never be at pos24.

Constraint 7 says that pos24 can be not clear for at most one continuous sequence of states.

I'll visualize the grid again:

```
11 12 13 14 15
21 22 23 24 25 (player1)
31 32 33 34 35
41 42 43 44 (stone1) 45
51 52 53 54 (goal) 55
```

Let's draw out the operations:

1. Player1 (at pos25) needs to move to a position from where they can push stone1 (at pos44) to another position.
   - Moving to pos34 would allow pushing stone1 horizontally to pos54 (the goal), but constraint 4 says that before player1 can be at pos34, either pos34 must not be clear or stone1 must be at pos55.
   - Moving to pos43 would allow pushing stone1 vertically up (to pos34), which would then satisfy "pos34 is not clear" for constraint 4. But we'd need to move the stone from pos34 before player1 can go there.
   - Moving to pos45 would allow pushing stone1 vertically down (to pos43).

Let's opt for the second approach:

1. Player1 (at pos25) moves to pos35, then to pos34, then to pos43.
2. Player1 (at pos43) pushes stone1 (at pos44) to pos34. (Stone1 is now at pos34 and player1 is at pos44)
3. Player1 (at pos44) needs to move to a position from where they can push stone1 (at pos34) to another position.
   - Moving to pos24 (to push stone1 to pos44 again) is not allowed due to constraint 2.
   - Moving to pos33 would allow pushing stone1 horizontally left (to pos23), but we need stone1 to end up at pos54.
   - Moving to pos35 and then to pos25 would allow pushing stone1 vertically up (to pos24), but again, that's not our goal.
   - Moving to pos45, then to pos55, then to pos54, then to pos53, then to pos43, then to pos33 would allow pushing stone1 to pos23.

Hmm, this is getting complex. Let's step back and think of a more direct approach.

Actually, thinking about it, the constraint 6 about pos12 not being clear before player1 is at pos44 seems to be a significant challenge. Since the stone starts at pos44, the player would need to push it elsewhere, move it to pos12, and then bring it back to pos44 and then to pos54.

Let's try to construct a plan where, first, we push stone1 to pos12, then push it to pos55, and finally push it to pos54.

I'll start at the initial state:

1. Player1 is at pos25, stone1 is at pos44.
2. Player1 moves to pos35 from pos25.
3. Player1 moves to pos34 from pos35.
4. Player1 moves to pos43 from pos34.
5. Player1 pushes stone1 from pos44 to pos34 (player1 is now at pos44, stone1 is at pos34).
6. Player1 moves to pos45 from pos44.
7. Player1 moves to pos35 from pos45.
8. Player1 pushes stone1 from pos34 to pos33 (player1 is now at pos34, stone1 is at pos33).
9. Player1 moves to pos23 from pos33 (avoiding pos24).
10. Player1 pushes stone1 from pos33 to pos23 (player1 is now at pos33, stone1 is at pos23).
11. Player1 moves to pos22 from pos33 (again, avoiding pos24).
12. Player1 pushes stone1 from pos23 to pos22 (player1 is now at pos23, stone1 is at pos22).
13. Player1 moves to pos12 from pos23 (avoiding pos24).
14. Player1 pushes stone1 from pos22 to pos12 (player1 is now at pos22, stone1 is at pos12).

At this point, stone1 is at pos12, which means pos12 is not clear. This satisfies the condition for constraint 6, which says that before player1 can be at pos44, pos12 must not be clear.

Now, the challenge is to move stone1 from pos12 to pos55 and then to pos54. This gets complex because of the constraint that player1 can never be at pos24.

Let's look at one path:

15. Player1 moves from pos22 to pos23.
16. Player1 moves from pos23 to pos33.
17. Player1 moves from pos33 to pos43.
18. Player1 moves from pos43 to pos53.
19. Player1 moves from pos53 to pos52.
20. Player1 moves from pos52 to pos42.
21. Player1 moves from pos42 to pos32.
22. Player1 moves from pos32 to pos22.
23. Player1 moves from pos22 to pos21.
24. Player1 moves from pos21 to pos11.
25. Player1 pushes stone1 from pos12 to pos11 (player1 is now at pos12, stone1 is at pos11).
26. Player1 moves from pos12 to pos13.
27. Player1 moves from pos13 to pos14.
28. Player1 moves from pos14 to pos15. (This satisfies constraint 1.)
29. Player1 moves from pos15 to pos25.
30. Player1 moves from pos25 to pos35.
31. Player1 moves from pos35 to pos45.
32. Player1 moves from pos45 to pos55.
33. Player1 moves from pos55 to pos54.
34. Player1 moves from pos54 to pos53.
35. Player1 moves from pos53 to pos43.
36. Player1 moves from pos43 to pos33.
37. Player1 moves from pos33 to pos23.
38. Player1 moves from pos23 to pos22.
39. Player1 moves from pos22 to pos21.
40. Player1 pushes stone1 from pos11 to pos21 (player1 is now at pos11, stone1 is at pos21).
41. Player1 moves from pos11 to pos21 (pushing stone1 to pos31).
...

This path is getting very convoluted, and it's not efficient. Let's approach it differently.

Rather than trying to move stone1 from pos44 to pos12 and back, let's see if there's another way to satisfy constraint 6.

Actually, let's think of the constraints again. Constraint 6 says that before player1 can be at pos44, pos12 must not be clear. This doesn't necessarily mean the stone has to be at pos12. It just means pos12 must not be clear. The only way for a location to be not clear is if the player or the stone is there. Since the player can't be at both pos44 and pos12 at the same time, we're back to thinking the stone should be at pos12 before the player is at pos44.

But, and this is just a thought, what if the constraint is time-based? Maybe pos12 must have been "not clear" at some point before player1 is at pos44, even if it's clear at the moment player1 is at pos44.

Actually, that's consistent with how we've been interpreting constraint 4. So I think we're on the right track.

Alright, let's reconsider our approach:

1. I'll try to have stone1 at pos12 at some point, to satisfy constraint 6 for the future.
2. I'll then have stone1 at pos55 at some point, which would allow me to then have player1 at pos34 (constraint 4).
3. Once I've achieved the above, I'll push stone1 to pos54 (the goal). 

Let's start by outlining how to get stone1 from pos44 to pos12:

1. Player1 starts at pos25, stone1 is at pos44.
2. Player1 moves to pos35 from pos25.
3. Player1 moves to pos34 from pos35.
4. Player1 moves to pos43 from pos34. (This satisfies constraint 1.)
5. Player1 pushes stone1 from pos44 to pos34 (player1 is now at pos44, stone1 is at pos34).
6. Player1 moves to pos43 from pos44.
7. Player1 pushes stone1 from pos34 to pos33 (player1 is now at pos34, stone1 is at pos33).
8. Player1 moves to pos23 from pos33 (avoiding pos24).
9. Player1 pushes stone1 from pos33 to pos23 (player1 is now at pos33, stone1 is at pos23).
10. Player1 moves to pos22 from pos33 (again, avoiding pos24). 
11. Player1 pushes stone1 from pos23 to pos22 (player1 is now at pos23, stone1 is at pos22).
12. Player1 moves to pos12 from pos23 (avoiding pos24).
13. Player1 pushes stone1 from pos22 to pos12 (player1 is now at pos22, stone1 is at pos12).

Now, stone1 is at pos12. I've satisfied constraint 6 (if it's time-based). Now, I need to move stone1 to pos55 (to satisfy constraint 4 in the future). But before that, I might already have satisfied constraint 1 (player1 must be at pos15 or pos43 at some point) since player1 was at pos43 in step 4.

Let's move forward:

14. Player1 moves from pos22 to pos32.
15. Player1 moves from pos32 to pos33.
16. Player1 moves from pos33 to pos34. (This satisfies constraint 3.)
17. Player1 moves from pos34 to pos35.
18. Player1 moves from pos35 to pos25.
19. Player1 moves from pos25 to pos15. (This satisfies constraint 1 again, just to be safe.)
20. Player1 moves from pos15 to pos14.
21. Player1 moves from pos14 to pos13.
22. Player1 pushes stone1 from pos12 to pos13 (player1 is now at pos12, stone1 is at pos13).
23. Player1 moves from pos12 to pos13 (pushing stone1 to pos14).
24. Player1 moves from pos13 to pos14 (pushing stone1 to pos15).
25. Player1 moves from pos14 to pos15 (pushing stone1 to pos25).
26. Player1 moves from pos15 to pos25 (pushing stone1 to pos35).
27. Player1 moves from pos25 to pos35 (pushing stone1 to pos45).
28. Player1 moves from pos35 to pos45 (pushing stone1 to pos55).

Now, stone1 is at pos55, which satisfies constraint 4, and player1 is at pos45.

29. Player1 moves from pos45 to pos44.
30. Player1 moves from pos44 to pos43.
31. Player1 moves from pos43 to pos53.
32. Player1 moves from pos53 to pos54.
33. Player1 moves from pos54 to pos55 (pushing stone1 to pos54).

With this, stone1 is at the goal position pos54. I believe this plan satisfies all the constraints.

Actually, I realized I'm misunderstanding constraint 4. Let's review it again: "If expression 'player1 is at location pos34' holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: 'At least one of the following conditions is true: "Location pos34 is not clear", "stone1 is at location pos55"'".

This means that before player1 is at pos34, we must have had a state where either pos34 was not clear or stone1 was at pos55. In my current plan, I had player1 at pos34 in step 3, but at that point, neither pos34 had been not clear, nor had stone1 been at pos55. This violates constraint 4.

Similarly, I had player1 at pos44 in step 5, but, I'm also not so sure that pos12 had been not clear at that point, which might violate constraint 6.

I should refactor the plan to ensure these constraints are met in the correct order. Let's go back to the initial state and create a new plan.

Actually, wait. The initial state says "Location pos34 is clear" and "stone1 is at location pos44". So, to satisfy constraint 4, I'd need to move stone1 to pos55 first. Then, once constraint 4 is satisfied, I can have player1 at pos34. And similarly, I'd need to have pos12 not clear before player1 can be at pos44.

The primary goal is to push stone1 from pos44 to pos54. For this, we'd want player1 to be at pos34 to push stone1 horizontally right.

First, I'll try to move stone1 to pos55 to satisfy constraint 4:

1. Player1 is at pos25, stone1 is at pos44.
2. Player1 moves to pos35 from pos25.
3. Player1 moves to pos45 from pos35.
4. Player1 pushes stone1 from pos44 to pos45 (player1 is now at pos44, stone1 is at pos45).
5. Player1 moves from pos44 to pos45 (pushing stone1 to pos55).

Now stone1 is at pos55, which satisfies constraint 4, and player1 is at pos45. But I also need to satisfy constraint 6 (pos12 must be not clear before player1 is at pos44). Player1 was already at pos44 in step 4, but pos12 might not have been not clear at that point, violating constraint 6.

So maybe we first need to get stone1 to pos12, then come back to get it to the goal. Let's revise:

1. Player1 is at pos25, stone1 is at pos44.
2. Player1 moves to pos35 from pos25.
3. Player1 moves to pos34 from pos35 (I'm avoiding having player1 at pos44 before pos12 is not clear).
4. Player1 moves to pos33 from pos34 (notice that I never had player1 at pos34 in the final plan, to avoid the complication with constraint 4).
5. Player1 moves to pos43 from pos33. (This satisfies constraint 1.)
6. Player1 pushes stone1 from pos44 to pos34 (player1 is now at pos44, stone1 is at pos34). (This violates constraint 6 unless pos12 was previously not clear, which I need to fix.)

Actually, I seem to be having difficulty devising a plan where I can push stone1 to pos12 without having player1 at pos44, and moving stone1 to pos55 without having player1 at pos34. It seems like a circular dependency in the constraints.

Let's think differently. Maybe the constraints are actually not as strict as I'm interpreting them or maybe there's a clever way to work around them.

Let me first ask: Can I push stone1 from its initial position at pos44 without having player1 at pos34 or pos43 or pos45? (And thus, never having player1 at pos44 before pos12 was not clear.)

Hmm, it seems like player1 must be adjacent to stone1 to push it, so they'd need to be at pos34, pos43, or pos45 to push stone1 from pos44. There's no way to push it without being at one of these positions.

Let's reinterpret. The constraints 4 and 6 are:

4. If player1 is at pos34, then there must have been a previous state where pos34 was not clear or stone1 was at pos55.
6. If player1 is at pos44, then there must have been a previous state where pos12 was not clear.

I've been interpreting these constraints too broadly. Let's be more specific.

In the initial state, player1 is at pos25 and stone1 is at pos44. The most direct path to have the stone at the goal (pos54) is to push it from pos44 to pos54, which would require player1 to be at pos34. But constraint 4 says that before player1 can be at pos34, either pos34 must have been not clear or stone1 must have been at pos55.

So, I first need to ensure that either pos34 is not clear (meaning stone1 or player1 is there) or stone1 is at pos55 before player1 is at pos34 again.

Similarly, constraint 6 says that before player1 can be at pos44, pos12 must have been not clear.

Let's rebuild the plan:

1. Player1 is at pos25, stone1 is at pos44.
2. Player1 moves to pos35 from pos25.
3. Player1 moves to pos45 from pos35.
4. Player1 pushes stone1 from pos44 to pos45 (player1 is now at pos44, stone1 is at pos45). (I'm temporarily violating constraint 6 here, but I plan to move stone1 to pos12 soon to satisfy it.)
5. Player1 moves from pos44 to pos45 (pushing stone1 to pos55).

Now, stone1 is at pos55, which would satisfy constraint 4 for the future, and player1 is at pos45.

6. Player1 moves from pos45 to pos44.
7. Player1 moves from pos44 to pos43.
8. Player1 moves from pos43 to pos42.
9. Player1 moves from pos42 to pos32.
10. Player1 moves from pos32 to pos22.
11. Player1 moves from pos22 to pos12.

Now, player1 is at pos12, which makes pos12 not clear. This would satisfy constraint 6 for the future.

12. Player1 moves from pos12 to pos22.
13. Player1 moves from pos22 to pos32.
14. Player1 moves from pos32 to pos42.
15. Player1 moves from pos42 to pos52.
16. Player1 moves from pos52 to pos53.
17. Player1 moves from pos53 to pos54.
18. Player1 moves from pos54 to pos55 (pushing stone1 to pos54).

With this, stone1 is at the goal position pos54. I believe this plan now aligns correctly with the real meaning of the constraints.

Actually, looking again at the constraints:

4. If player1 is at pos34, then there must have been a previous state where pos34 was not clear or stone1 was at pos55.
6. If player1 is at pos44, then there must have been a previous state where pos12 was not clear.

I never had player1 at pos34 in my latest plan. I avoided this to bypass constraint 4. However, constraint 3 explicitly states that at some point, player1 must be at pos34. So I can't simply avoid having player1 at pos34.

Let's revise the plan to ensure player1 is at pos34 at some point. Taking advantage of the fact that stone1 is at pos55 at one point, which would satisfy constraint 4:

1. Player1 is at pos25, stone1 is at pos44.
2. Player1 moves to pos35 from pos25.
3. Player1 moves to pos45 from pos35.
4. Player1 pushes stone1 from pos44 to pos45 (player1 is now at pos44, stone1 is at pos45). (I'm temporarily violating constraint 6 here, but I plan to move player1 to pos12 soon to satisfy it.)
5. Player1 moves from pos44 to pos45 (pushing stone1 to pos55).

Now, stone1 is at pos55, which would satisfy constraint 4 for the future, and player1 is at pos45.

6. Player1 moves from pos45 to pos44.
7. Player1 moves from pos44 to pos43.
8. Player1 moves from pos43 to pos33.
9. Player1 moves from pos33 to pos34. (This satisfies constraint 3, and it doesn't violate constraint 4 because stone1 is at pos55.)
10. Player1 moves from pos34 to pos33.
11. Player1 moves from pos33 to pos23.
12. Player1 moves from pos23 to pos13.
13. Player1 moves from pos13 to pos12.

Now, player1 is at pos12, which makes pos12 not clear. This would satisfy constraint 6 for the future.

14. Player1 moves from pos12 to pos13.
15. Player1 moves from pos13 to pos23.
16. Player1 moves from pos23 to pos33.
17. Player1 moves from pos33 to pos43.
18. Player1 moves from pos43 to pos53.
19. Player1 moves from pos53 to pos54.
20. Player1 moves from pos54 to pos55 (pushing stone1 to pos54).

With this, stone1 is at the goal position pos54. I believe this revised plan satisfies all the constraints.

Wait, I realized I still have a misunderstanding: In the constraints:

4. If player1 is at pos34, then there must have been a previous state where pos34 was not clear or stone1 was at pos55.
6. If player1 is at pos44, then there must have been a previous state where pos12 was not clear.

The problem is that I might have misinterpreted the "previous state" part. In constraint 4, it says there must be a previous state where pos34 was not clear or stone1 was at pos55. I've been thinking this means that, for example, stone1 must be at pos55 before player1 is at pos34. But maybe it means there must have been a state where pos34 was not clear or stone1 was at pos55 before player1 is at pos34 even if that state doesn't immediately precede player1 being at pos34.

In simpler terms, at some point before player1 is at pos34, either pos34 must have been not clear or stone1 must have been at pos55.

Similarly, for constraint 6, at some point before player1 is at pos44, pos12 must have been not clear.

But you know what? I think I got it right. I think I just need to be clear about the order of operations. In my revised plan:

- Stone1 is at pos55 in step 5.
- Player1 is at pos34 in step 9.
- Player1 is at pos12 in step 13.
- Player1 is at pos44 in steps 4 and 6.

So, stone1 is at pos55 before player1 is at pos34 (step 5 before step 9). But, I have player1 at pos44 in step 4, before player1 is at pos12 in step 13. This violates constraint 6. So my plan is not entirely correct. Let me revise it again.

Also, another check:

Constraint 7 states that pos24 can be not clear for at most one continuous sequence of states. In my revised plan, I've avoided pos24 entirely, so this constraint is satisfied.

Let me revise the plan to ensure player1 is only at pos44 after pos12 has been not clear:

1. Player1 is at pos25, stone1 is at pos44.
2. Player1 moves to pos35 from pos25.
3. Player1 moves to pos34 from pos35. (I'll deal with constraint 4 later; I have to go to pos34 at some point because of constraint 3.)
4. Player1 moves to pos33 from pos34.
5. Player1 moves to pos23 from pos33.
6. Player1 moves to pos13 from pos23.
7. Player1 moves to pos12 from pos13. (This makes pos12 not clear, satisfying constraint 6 for the future.)
8. Player1 moves from pos12 to pos13.
9. Player1 moves from pos13 to pos23.
10. Player1 moves from pos23 to pos33.
11. Player1 moves from pos33 to pos43.
12. Player1 pushes stone1 from pos44 to pos45 (player1 is now at pos44, stone1 is at pos45). (Now, player1 is at pos44 after pos12 has been not clear, which aligns with constraint 6.)
13. Player1 moves from pos44 to pos45 (pushing stone1 to pos55).

Now, stone1 is at pos55, which satisfies constraint 4 for the future.

14. Player1 moves from pos45 to pos35.
15. Player1 moves from pos35 to pos34. (This satisfies constraint 3 and doesn't violate constraint 4 because stone1 has been at pos55.)
16. Player1 moves from pos34 to pos33.
17. Player1 moves from pos33 to pos43.
18. Player1 moves from pos43 to pos53.
19. Player1 moves from pos53 to pos54.
20. Player1 moves from pos54 to pos55 (pushing stone1 to pos54).

With this, stone1 is at the goal position pos54. I believe this plan now correctly adheres to all constraints.

Let's recheck if there are any violations:

Constraint 1: At some point, player1 must be at either pos15 or pos43.
I have player1 at pos43 in steps 11 and 17, so this is satisfied.

Constraint 2: player1 can never be at pos24.
I've avoided pos24 in the entire plan, so this is satisfied.

Constraint 3: At some point, player1 must be at pos34.
I have player1 at pos34 in steps 3 and 15, so this is satisfied.

Constraint 4: If player1 is at pos34, then there must have been a previous state where pos34 was not clear or stone1 was at pos55.
I have player1 at pos34 in steps 3 and 15. For step 15, I have stone1 at pos55 from step 13, so it's fine. But for step 3, I haven't had a previous state where pos34 was not clear or stone1 was at pos55. This might violate the constraint. Let me revise.

Constraint 6: If player1 is at pos44, then there must have been a previous state where pos12 was not clear.
I have player1 at pos44 in step 12, and pos12 was not clear in step 7, so this is fine.

Constraint 7: pos24 can be not clear for at most one continuous sequence of states.
I've avoided pos24 entirely, so this constraint is satisfied.

I still need to respect constraint 4. Let's revise the plan.

Actually, let's think about constraint 4's implications. It's saying that if player1 is ever going to be at pos34, then before that, either pos34 must have been not clear (meaning the stone or the player was there) or stone1 must have been at pos55.

As a side note, I'm still unsure how I can make pos34 not clear without having player1 or stone1 there (and if player1 is there, I'm going against constraint 4). But if we can make sure stone1 is at pos55 before player1 is ever at pos34, I should be ok.

Let's revise the plan to ensure stone1 is at pos55 before player1 is at pos34:

1. Player1 is at pos25, stone1 is at pos44.
2. Player1 moves to pos35 from pos25.
3. Player1 moves to pos45 from pos35. (I'm avoiding having player1 at pos34 for now.)
4. Player1 moves to pos55 from pos45. (Avoiding pos44 for now because of constraint 6.)
5. Player1 moves to pos54 from pos55.
6. Player1 moves to pos53 from pos54. (Again, I'm moving around, avoiding pos34 and pos44.)
7. Player1 moves to pos43 from pos53. (This satisfies constraint 1.)
8. Player1 moves from pos43 to pos33. (Still avoiding pos34 for now.)
9. Player1 moves from pos33 to pos23.
10. Player1 moves from pos23 to pos13.
11. Player1 moves from pos13 to pos12. (This makes pos12 not clear, satisfying constraint 6 for the future.)
12. Player1 moves from pos12 to pos13.
13. Player1 moves from pos13 to pos23.
14. Player1 moves from pos23 to pos33.
15. Player1 moves from pos33 to pos43.
16. Player1 pushes stone1 from pos44 to pos45 (player1 is now at pos44, stone1 is at pos45). (Now, player1 is at pos44 after pos12 has been not clear, which aligns with constraint 6.)
17. Player1 moves from pos44 to pos45 (pushing stone1 to pos55).

Now, stone1 is at pos55, which satisfies constraint 4 for the future.

18. Player1 moves from pos45 to pos35.
19. Player1 moves from pos35 to pos34. (This satisfies constraint 3 and doesn't violate constraint 4 because stone1 has been at pos55.)
20. Player1 moves from pos34 to pos33.
21. Player1 moves from pos33 to pos43.
22. Player1 moves from pos43 to pos53.
23. Player1 moves from pos53 to pos54.
24. Player1 moves from pos54 to pos55 (pushing stone1 to pos54).

With this, stone1 is at the goal position pos54. I believe this plan should satisfy all the constraints now.

Ah, no wait, there's still something wrong. In constraint 4, it says "If expression 'player1 is at location pos34' holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: 'At least one of the following conditions is true: "Location pos34 is not clear", "stone1 is at location pos55"'"

In my plan, player1 is at pos34 in step 19, and stone1 is at pos55 in step 17. So this part is fine.

But I'm still concerned about constraint 6: "If expression 'player1 is at location pos44' holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: 'Location pos12 is not clear'"

In my plan, player1 is at pos44 in step 16, and pos12 is not clear in step 11. So this part also seems fine. I think this plan indeed satisfies all the constraints.

Ok, wait, actually I realize I still have a problem with constraint 4. In my plan, player1 is at pos34 in step 19, and I have stone1 at pos55 in step 17. So that part is fine.

But I realized I'm still violating that constraint in step 3, where player1 moves from pos35 to pos34. At that point, stone1 has never been at pos55. Let me correct the plan:

1. Player1 is at pos25, stone1 is at pos44.
2. Player1 moves to pos35 from pos25.
3. Player1 moves to pos45 from pos35. (I'm avoiding having player1 at pos34 for now.)
4. Player1 pushes stone1 from pos44 to pos45 (player1 is now at pos44, stone1 is at pos45). (I'm temporarily violating constraint 6 here, but I'll handle it.)
5. Player1 moves from pos44 to pos45 (pushing stone1 to pos55).

Now, stone1 is at pos55, which would satisfy constraint 4 for the future.

6. Player1 moves from pos45 to pos35.
7. Player1 moves from pos35 to pos25.
8. Player1 moves from pos25 to pos15. (This satisfies constraint 1.)
9. Player1 moves from pos15 to pos14.
10. Player1 moves from pos14 to pos13.
11. Player1 moves from pos13 to pos12. (This makes pos12 not clear, satisfying constraint 6 for the future.)
12. Player1 moves from pos12 to pos13.
13. Player1 moves from pos13 to pos14.
14. Player1 moves from pos14 to pos15.
15. Player1 moves from pos15 to pos25.
16. Player1 moves from pos25 to pos35.
17. Player1 moves from pos35 to pos34. (This satisfies constraint 3 and doesn't violate constraint 4 because stone1 is at pos55 from step 5.)
18. Player1 moves from pos34 to pos33.
19. Player1 moves from pos33 to pos43.
20. Player1 moves from pos43 to pos53.
21. Player1 moves from pos53 to pos54.
22. Player1 pushes stone1 from pos55 to pos54 (player1 is now at pos55, stone1 is at pos54).

With this, stone1 is at the goal position pos54. I believe this plan now correctly adheres to all constraints.

Wait, I revisited the constraints, and I think I'm confused about constraint 6: "If expression 'player1 is at location pos44' holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: 'Location pos12 is not clear'"

The issue is that I have player1 at pos44 in step 4, before pos12 is not clear in step 11. This violates the constraint. Let me try again.

Actually, let's think of a different approach:

1. Get player1 to pos12 first, making it not clear.
2. Then, have player1 push stone1 to pos55.
3. Then, have player1 go to pos34.
4. Finally, have player1 push stone1 to the goal.

Let's see:

1. Player1 is at pos25, stone1 is at pos44.
2. Player1 moves to pos15 from pos25. (This satisfies constraint 1.)
3. Player1 moves to pos14 from pos15.
4. Player1 moves to pos13 from pos14.
5. Player1 moves to pos12 from pos13. (This makes pos12 not clear.)
6. Player1 moves from pos12 to pos13.
7. Player1 moves from pos13 to pos14.
8. Player1 moves from pos14 to pos15.
9. Player1 moves from pos15 to pos25.
10. Player1 moves from pos25 to pos35.
11. Player1 moves from pos35 to pos45.
12. Player1 pushes stone1 from pos44 to pos45 (player1 is now at pos44, stone1 is at pos45). (Player1 is at pos44 after pos12 was not clear, satisfying constraint 6.)
13. Player1 moves from pos44 to pos45 (pushing stone1 to pos55).

Now, stone1 is at pos55.

14. Player1 moves from pos45 to pos35.
15. Player1 moves from pos35 to pos34. (This satisfies constraint 3 and doesn't violate constraint 4 because stone1 is at pos55 from step 13.)
16. Player1 moves from pos34 to pos44.
17. Player1 moves from pos44 to pos54.
18. Player1 pushes stone1 from pos55 to pos54 (player1 is now at pos55, stone1 is at pos54).

With this, stone1 is at the goal position pos54. I've checked the constraints, and this plan seems to adhere to all of them.

So, the final plan is:

1. Player1 moves to pos15 from pos25.
2. Player1 moves to pos14 from pos15.
3. Player1 moves to pos13 from pos14.
4. Player1 moves to pos12 from pos13.
5. Player1 moves from pos12 to pos13.
6. Player1 moves from pos13 to pos14.
7. Player1 moves from pos14 to pos15.
8. Player1 moves from pos15 to pos25.
9. Player1 moves from pos25 to pos35.
10. Player1 moves from pos35 to pos45.
11. Player1 pushes stone1 from pos44 to pos45.
12. Player1 moves from pos44 to pos45 (pushing stone1 to pos55).
13. Player1 moves from pos45 to pos35.
14. Player1 moves from pos35 to pos34.
15. Player1 moves from pos34 to pos44.
16. Player1 moves from pos44 to pos54.
17. Player1 pushes stone1 from pos55 to pos54.

Let me double-check against the constraints once more:

Constraint 1: At some point, player1 must be at either pos15 or pos43.
I have player1 at pos15 in steps 1 and 7, so this is satisfied.

Constraint 2: player1 can never be at pos24.
I've avoided pos24 in the entire plan, so this is satisfied.

Constraint 3: At some point, player1 must be at pos34.
I have player1 at pos34 in step 14, so this is satisfied.

Constraint 4: If player1 is at pos34, then there must have been a previous state where pos34 was not clear or stone1 was at pos55.
I have player1 at pos34 in step 14, and stone1 is at pos55 from step 12, so this is satisfied.

Constraint 6: If player1 is at pos44, then there must have been a previous state where pos12 was not clear.
I have player1 at pos44 in steps 11 and 15, and pos12 was not clear in step 4, so this is satisfied.

Constraint 7: pos24 can be not clear for at most one continuous sequence of states.
I've avoided pos24 entirely, so this constraint is satisfied.

Step 15 should actually say "Player1 moves from pos34 to pos44". I've corrected it.

It seems like the plan is solid. However, to add one more check, the step "Player1 moves from pos34 to pos44" seems to be missing a valid move. Let me check the valida connections:

"You may move from location pos34 to location pos24 following direction dirleft" (but this would violate constraint 2)
"You may move from location pos34 to location pos44 following direction dirright"
"You may move from location pos34 to location pos33 following direction dirup"
"You may move from location pos34 to location pos35 following direction dirdown"

There does seem to be be a valid direction from pos34 to pos44 following dirright. So that step is valid.

Let's also check the available moves for "Player1 moves from pos44 to pos54":

"You may move from location pos44 to location pos34 following direction dirleft"
"You may move from location pos44 to location pos54 following direction dirright"
"You may move from location pos44 to location pos43 following direction dirup"
"You may move from location pos44 to location pos45 following direction dirdown"

There's a valid move from pos44 to pos54 following dirright. So this step is also valid.

I think our plan is sound now. But I'm forgetting that we need to specify the actions based on the list of available actions given in the problem statement. Let's now revise the steps to match the format:

1. "move player1 pos25 pos15 dirdown": Player1 moves from pos25 to pos15.
2. "move player1 pos15 pos14 dirup": Player1 moves from pos15 to pos14.
3. "move player1 pos14 pos13 dirup": Player1 moves from pos14 to pos13.
4. "move player1 pos13 pos12 dirup": Player1 moves from pos13 to pos12.
5. "move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown": Player1 moves from pos12 to pos13.
6. "move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown": Player1 moves from pos13 to pos14.
7. "move player1 pos14 pos15 dirdown": Player1 moves from pos14 to pos15.
8. "move player1 pos15 pos25 dirright": Player1 moves from pos15 to pos25.
9. "move player1 pos25 pos35 dirright": Player1 moves from pos25 to pos35.
10. "move player1 pos35 pos45 dirright": Player1 moves from pos35 to pos45.
11. "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos45 pos44 pos45 dirleft": Player1, at pos45, pushes stone1 from pos44 to pos45.
12. "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos45 pos55 dirright": Player1, at pos44, pushes stone1 from pos45 to pos55.
13. "move player1 pos45 pos35 dirleft": Player1 moves from pos45 to pos35.
14. "move player1 pos35 pos34 dirup": Player1 moves from pos35 to pos34.
15. "move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright": Player1 moves from pos34 to pos44.
16. "move player1 pos44 pos54 dirright": Player1 moves from pos44 to pos54.
17. "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos54 pos55 pos54 dirup": Player1, at pos54, pushes stone1 from pos55 to pos54.

Let's check the action formats:

"move p l_from l_to d": Move agent p from location l_from to location l_to following direction d.
"pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": Make agent p, situated at location l_p, push stone s from location l_from to goal location l_to, following direction d.
"pushtonongoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": Make agent p, situated at location l_p, push stone s from location l_from to non-goal location l_to, following direction d.

I believe the format is almost fine, but I think it's a bit confusing. I've conflated "player1, at pos45, pushes stone1 from pos44 to pos45" with "player1, at pos44, pushes stone1 from pos45 to pos55". Let me sort it out better:

In step 11, player1 is at pos45, and stone1 is at pos44. Player1 moves to pos44, pushing stone1 to pos45.

In step 12, player1 is now at pos44, and stone1 is at pos45. Player1 moves to pos45, pushing stone1 to pos55.

So the actual steps 11 and 12 should be:

11. "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos45 pos44 pos45 dirleft": Player1, situated at pos45, pushes stone1 from pos44 to non-goal pos45.
12. "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos45 pos55 dirright": Player1, situated at pos44, pushes stone1 from pos45 to non-goal pos55.

Hmm, wait. I need to also check if step 17 is correct:

In step 17, player1 is at pos54, and stone1 is at pos55. Player1 moves to pos55, pushing stone1 to pos54. But since pos54 is a goal position, it should be "pushtogoal" and not "pushtonongoal" in this case.

Actually, let's double-check the action on step 17:

"pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos54 pos55 pos54 dirup"

This action should push stone1 from pos55 to pos54 (a goal position), with player1 initially at pos54.

But wait, if player1 is at pos54 and stone1 is at pos55, then player1 needs to move from pos54 to push stone1 from pos55 to pos54, so this doesn't seem right.

Oh, actually it might be a bit confusing to interpret the action formats, let me reconsider just to be sure:

"move p l_from l_to d": Move agent p from location l_from to location l_to following direction d.
"pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": Make agent p, situated at location l_p, push stone s from location l_from to goal location l_to, following direction d.
"pushtonongoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": Make agent p, situated at location l_p, push stone s from location l_from to non-goal location l_to, following direction d.

So for pushtogoal and pushtonongoal:
- p is the agent
- s is the stone
- l_p is the location of the agent
- l_from is the location of the stone
- l_to is the destination of the stone
- d is the direction

So in our step 17, player1 is at pos54, stone1 is at pos55, and we want to push stone1 to pos54. But the way I've written it, it's like I'm making player1 move from pos54 to... pos54? Which doesn't make sense.

Ok, I think I need to revisit the directions more carefully.

In the directions given:
- dirdown means up in the grid (decreasing the second coordinate)
- dirleft means left in the grid (decreasing the first coordinate)
- dirright means right in the grid (increasing the first coordinate)
- dirup means down in the grid (increasing the second coordinate)

Wait, actually let's think this through once more. Let me actually use the direction to guide me.

"pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": Make agent p, situated at location l_p, push stone s from location l_from to goal location l_to, following direction d.

For this action, agent p is at location l_p, stone s is at location l_from, and after the action, stone s will be at location l_to. The "following direction d" part refers to the direction in which the agent can reach the stone from its current position.

So, for step 17, we're trying to push stone1 from pos55 to pos54. The player is at pos54, and the stone is at pos55. Player1 would need to reach the stone by going from pos54 to pos55, which according to the direction map is dirdown.

So, step 17 should be:
"pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos54 pos55 pos54 dirdown": Player1, situated at pos54, pushes stone1 from pos55 to goal position pos54, following direction dirdown.

Similarly, for steps 11 and 12:

In step 11, player1 is at pos45, and stone1 is at pos44. Player1 would need to reach the stone by going from pos45 to pos44, which is to the left, so the direction is dirleft.

In step 12, player1 is now at pos44, and stone1 is at pos45. Player1 would need to reach the stone by going from pos44 to pos45, which is to the right, so the direction is dirright.

Wait, let's re-read the description for pushtonongoal:

"pushtonongoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": You may only perform this action if (i) agent p is at location l_p, (ii) stone s is at location l_from, (iii) location l_to is clear, (iv) you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d, (v) you can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d, and (vi) location l_to is not a goal location.

For this to be a valid action, both "you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d" and "you can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d" must be true. This means that the agent, the stone, and the destination must all be in line, and the same direction should be able to get the agent to the stone and then the stone to the destination.

For step 11:
- player1 is at pos45
- stone1 is at pos44
- the destination for stone1 is pos45 (which is a bit confusing; I think I've made a mistake in my reasoning)

But these three positions are not in a straight line. Let me rethink this...

Actually, I think my plan is not quite working as I anticipated. Let me see...

1. Player1 is at pos25, stone1 is at pos44.
2. Player1 moves to pos35 from pos25.
3. Player1 moves to pos45 from pos35.
4. Player1 should push stone1 from pos44 to somewhere, but this push doesn't seem to be in a straight line...

Maybe I need to reconsider the actions. Let's think again:

"pushtonongoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": You may only perform this action if (i) agent p is at location l_p, (ii) stone s is at location l_from, (iii) location l_to is clear, (iv) you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d, (v) you can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d, and (vi) location l_to is not a goal location.

For this action, the agent is trying to push the stone, and for that, the agent, the stone, and the destination must be in a straight line.

Actually, I think I misunderstood the grid layout.

Let me try to understand the initial state again:

Player1 is at pos25, stone1 is at pos44. Given the connections, I think the grid is like:

```
11 21 31 41 51
12 22 32 42 52
13 23 33 43 53
14 24 34 44 54
15 25 35 45 55
```

In this grid:
- Player1 is at pos25
- Stone1 is at pos44
- The goal is at pos54

Now, let's rethink the plan:

1. Player1 is at pos25, stone1 is at pos44.
2. Player1 moves to pos24 from pos25 (following dirup), but this is not allowed because of constraint 2.
3. Player1 moves to pos15 from pos25 (following dirleft), which is allowed.
4. Player1 moves to pos14 from pos15 (following dirup), which is allowed.
5. Player1 moves to pos13 from pos14 (following dirup), which is allowed.
6. Player1 moves to pos12 from pos13 (following dirup), which is allowed.
7. Player1 moves to pos13 from pos12 (following dirdown), which is allowed.
8. Player1 moves to pos14 from pos13 (following dirdown), which is allowed.
9. Player1 moves to pos15 from pos14 (following dirdown), which is allowed.
10. Player1 moves to pos25 from pos15 (following dirright), which is allowed.
11. Player1 moves to pos35 from pos25 (following dirright), which is allowed.
12. Player1 moves to pos34 from pos35 (following dirup), but this would violate constraint 4 since neither pos34 has been not clear, nor has stone1 been at pos55. I need to move stone1 to pos55 before I can move to pos34.

Let me restart my plan. I'll think more carefully.

Sorry for the confusion. I think I'm getting confused with the grid layout. let's think clearly.

Actually, the planning problem says "You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright", which makes more sense for the grid I had initially, with posXY representing the position at row X, column Y. So I'm sticking with that.

```
11 12 13 14 15
21 22 23 24 25 (player1)
31 32 33 34 35
41 42 43 44 (stone1) 45
51 52 53 54 (goal) 55
```

In this grid, player1 can go down to pos15 (by going dirleft), and stone1 is to the right and down from player1.

Alright, let's develop the plan once more:

1. Player1 is at pos25, stone1 is at pos44.
2. Player1 moves to pos15 from pos25 (following dirleft), which satisfies constraint 1.
3. Player1 moves to pos14 from pos15 (following dirup).
4. Player1 moves to pos13 from pos14 (following dirup).
5. Player1 moves to pos12 from pos13 (following dirup), which makes pos12 not clear.
6. Player1 moves to pos13 from pos12 (following dirdown).
7. Player1 moves to pos23 from pos13 (following dirright).
8. Player1 moves to pos33 from pos23 (following dirright).
9. Player1 moves to pos43 from pos33 (following dirright). (This satisfies constraint 1 again, just to be safe.)
10. Player1, at pos43, pushes stone1 from pos44 to pos45 following dirright. (Player1 is now at pos44, stone1 is at pos45, and pos43 is clear.)
11. Player1, at pos44, pushes stone1 from pos45 to pos55 following dirright. (Player1 is now at pos45, stone1 is at pos55, and pos44 is clear.)

So now, stone1 is at pos55, and player1 is at pos45. Since stone1 has been at pos55, constraint 4 is now satisfied for the future.

12. Player1 moves to pos35 from pos45 (following dirleft).
13. Player1 moves to pos34 from pos35 (following dirup), which satisfies constraint 3 and doesn't violate constraint 4 since stone1 has been at pos55.
14. Player1 moves to pos44 from pos34 (following dirright), which doesn't violate constraint 6 since pos12 has been not clear.
15. Player1 moves to pos54 from pos44 (following dirright).
16. Player1, at pos54, pushes stone1 from pos55 to pos54 following dirdown. (Player1 is now at pos55, stone1 is at pos54, and pos54 is a goal location.)

With this, stone1 is at the goal position pos54. I believe this plan now correctly adheres to all constraints.

Let's format these steps properly:

1. "move player1 pos25 pos15 dirleft": Player1 moves from pos25 to pos15.
2. "move player1 pos15 pos14 dirup": Player1 moves from pos15 to pos14.
3. "move player1 pos14 pos13 dirup": Player1 moves from pos14 to pos13.
4. "move player1 pos13 pos12 dirup": Player1 moves from pos13 to pos12.
5. "move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown": Player1 moves from pos12 to pos13.
6. "move player1 pos13 pos23 dirright": Player1 moves from pos13 to pos23.
7. "move player1 pos23 pos33 dirright": Player1 moves from pos23 to pos33.
8. "move player1 pos33 pos43 dirright": Player1 moves from pos33 to pos43.
9. "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos44 pos45 dirright": Player1, situated at pos43, pushes stone1 from pos44 to non-goal pos45 following dirright.
10. "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos45 pos55 dirright": Player1, situated at pos44, pushes stone1 from pos45 to non-goal pos55 following dirright.
11. "move player1 pos45 pos35 dirleft": Player1 moves from pos45 to pos35.
12. "move player1 pos35 pos34 dirup": Player1 moves from pos35 to pos34.
13. "move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright": Player1 moves from pos34 to pos44.
14. "move player1 pos44 pos54 dirright": Player1 moves from pos44 to pos54.
15. "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos54 pos55 pos54 dirdown": Player1, situated at pos54, pushes stone1 from pos55 to goal pos54 following dirdown.

Yep, I believe our plan now correctly adheres to all constraints!

One last observation:

Is this plan optimal? It's 15 steps, which seems pretty streamlined given all the constraints. There might be a shorter path, but given the non-trivial nature of the constraints, I think this is a good solution.

Okay, taking this as our final plan:

1. "move player1 pos25 pos15 dirleft"
2. "move player1 pos15 pos14 dirup"
3. "move player1 pos14 pos13 dirup"
4. "move player1 pos13 pos12 dirup"
5. "move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown"
6. "move player1 pos13 pos23 dirright"
7. "move player1 pos23 pos33 dirright"
8. "move player1 pos33 pos43 dirright"
9. "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos44 pos45 dirright"
10. "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos45 pos55 dirright"
11. "move player1 pos45 pos35 dirleft"
12. "move player1 pos35 pos34 dirup"
13. "move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright"
14. "move player1 pos44 pos54 dirright"
15. "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos54 pos55 pos54 dirdown"
