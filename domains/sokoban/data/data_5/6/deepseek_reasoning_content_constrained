Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. Hmm, the goal is to get stone1 to a goal location. From the initial state, stone1 is at pos44, and the only goal location mentioned is pos54. So I need to move stone1 from pos44 to pos54.

First, the agent starts at pos25. To push the stone, the agent needs to be adjacent to it. Since the stone is at pos44, the agent needs to get to pos43 or pos34 or pos45 to push it. But the allowed directions need to be checked.

Wait, the movement rules are based on the predefined connections. Let me check the movement possibilities around pos44. Looking at the "You may move from..." statements:

From pos44, you can go to pos34 (dirleft), pos54 (dirright), pos43 (dirup), pos45 (dirdown). So to push the stone from pos44 to pos54 (which is a goal), the agent needs to be at pos44's left (pos43) and push right. Wait, but to push, the agent has to be in a position adjacent in the direction of the push. So to push the stone from pos44 to pos54 (dirright), the agent needs to be at pos44's left (pos43) and then push towards dirright. Wait, the direction in the action is the direction from the agent's current position to the stone's position, and then from the stone's position to the target location.

Wait, the "pushtogoal" action requires that the agent is at l_p, which is adjacent to l_from (the stone's current position), and then the stone moves from l_from to l_to in direction d. So for pushing the stone right from pos44 to pos54, the agent needs to be at pos44's left (pos43), and direction from l_p (pos43) to l_from (pos44) would be dirright. Then, the direction from l_from to l_to (pos54) is dirright. So the action would be "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos44 pos54 dirright".

But first, the agent needs to get to pos43. Starting at pos25, how to reach pos43? Let's map the path.

Initial position: pos25. Possible moves from pos25 are to pos15 (dirleft), pos35 (dirright), or pos24 (dirup). Let's see. The constraints require that the agent is never at pos24. So moving to pos24 is forbidden. So from pos25, the agent can go left to pos15, right to pos35, or up to pos24 (but that's forbidden). So the first move can't be up. So maybe go right to pos35.

From pos35, possible moves: right to pos45, left to pos25, or up to pos34. Let's try moving to pos34. But wait, can we move from pos35 to pos34? The movement rules say: "You may move from location pos35 to location pos34 following direction dirup." So yes. So pos35 -> pos34 (dirup). Then from pos34, where can we go? pos34 can go left to pos24 (forbidden), right to pos44, up to pos33, or down to pos35. So maybe go right to pos44? But pos44 is occupied by the stone. So the agent can't move into pos44 unless it's clear. Wait, in the initial state, pos44 has the stone, so it's not clear. So the agent can't move into pos44. So from pos34, the agent can't go to pos44. Hmm.

Wait, the initial state lists "Location pos44 is clear" â€” no, wait, no. Wait the original state says "stone1 is at location pos44" and "Location pos44 is clear". Wait, how can a location be clear if there's a stone there? Wait, maybe "clear" means that neither the agent nor a stone is present. Wait, the problem says "Each position on the grid may contain either the agent, a stone or be empty." So if a stone is present, the location is not clear. But in the initial state, the user wrote "Location pos44 is clear" even though stone1 is there. Wait, that's a contradiction. Wait, looking back:

In the original state, under "The original state of the world is the following":

- "stone1 is at location pos44"
- "Location pos44 is clear"

Wait, that's conflicting. But according to the problem's description, if a location has a stone or the agent, it's not clear. So perhaps there's an error here. But according to the given initial state, pos44 is clear despite the stone being there. That must be a mistake, but I have to take the given initial state as correct. Wait, no, maybe the "clear" refers to the agent not being there. Because stones and the agent occupy the location. So "clear" means that neither the agent nor a stone is present. But in the initial state, pos44 has stone1, so it shouldn't be clear. But according to the given initial state, "Location pos44 is clear". That's a problem. Maybe it's a typo. Wait, looking back:

The original state includes:

"Location pos44 is clear"

But also:

"stone1 is at location pos44"

This is a contradiction. So perhaps there's an error in the problem setup. But I have to work with the given data. Maybe in this domain, a location is considered clear if the agent is not there, regardless of stones. Because the preconditions for move require that the destination is clear. So for moving, the agent can't move into a location that has a stone. But the initial state says pos44 is clear, even though stone1 is there. So perhaps "clear" in the problem refers to the absence of the agent. That would make sense. So a location is clear if the agent is not there, but a stone can be present. That's a possible interpretation. Because otherwise, the initial state is invalid.

So if "clear" means the agent is not present, then pos44 is clear (since the agent is at pos25). But stone1 is at pos44. So when moving, the agent can't go to a location that is not clear (i.e., has the agent). So stones don't block movement? That can't be right because pushing requires the stone to be in the adjacent position. Hmm, this is confusing.

Wait, the preconditions for "move" action: (ii) location l_to is clear. So if the agent wants to move to l_to, it must be clear. So "clear" here probably means that the agent is not there. But stones are allowed. Because otherwise, the initial state would have pos44 not clear (since stone1 is there), but the problem says it's clear. So perhaps "clear" only refers to the agent's presence.

But that would mean that the agent can move to a location with a stone, which is not possible. So this is a problem. Alternatively, maybe "clear" in the problem's terms refers to both agent and stones. So if a location has a stone, it's not clear. Then, the initial state is contradictory. Because pos44 has stone1 and is said to be clear. That's impossible. Therefore, there's a mistake in the problem statement. But since I have to proceed, perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the problem's initial state.

Alternatively, maybe "clear" is only about the agent. So if a location has a stone but no agent, it's considered clear. But that would allow the agent to move into a location with a stone, which doesn't make sense. So probably, the initial state is wrong. But given that, perhaps the problem's initial state has a typo, and stone1 is actually at a different location. But according to the problem, stone1 is at pos44, and pos44 is clear. So perhaps in this domain, stones don't block movement. But that's unusual.

Alternatively, maybe "clear" refers to the presence of the agent only. So a location is clear if the agent is not there, regardless of stones. But stones are separate. So when moving, the agent can move into a location with a stone, but that's not possible. That's conflicting. So perhaps the problem's initial state has an error, but we have to proceed with the given information.

Assuming that pos44 is clear (agent is not there), but stone1 is there. Then, the agent can move into pos44 if it's clear. But that's conflicting because stone1 is there. So maybe there's a misunderstanding here. Alternatively, perhaps "clear" refers to the absence of both agent and stones. Then, the initial state is invalid. Since the problem states that the initial state is valid, perhaps the correct interpretation is that "clear" means the agent is not present. So a location can have a stone and still be considered clear. That way, the agent can move into a location with a stone, but that's not possible because stones are objects. So this is confusing.

Alternatively, maybe the initial state has a typo, and stone1 is not at pos44. But according to the problem, stone1 is at pos44. So perhaps the problem's initial state is correct, and "clear" refers to the absence of the agent. So the agent can't move into a location that has another agent (but there's only one agent here). So in that case, pos44 is clear because the agent is not there, even though there's a stone. So moving to pos44 is allowed, but when the agent moves there, the stone is there. But that would mean two entities in the same location. That's impossible. Therefore, this suggests that the initial state is contradictory, but since we have to proceed, perhaps the correct interpretation is that "clear" refers to the absence of the agent. So stones do not affect whether a location is clear for movement. Therefore, the agent can move into a location with a stone, but that's impossible because the stone is there. This is conflicting.

Wait, the problem says: "Each position on the grid may contain either the agent, a stone or be empty." So each position can have only one of these. So if a stone is at pos44, then the agent can't be there. Therefore, in the initial state, pos44 is not clear (because it has a stone). But the problem states that "Location pos44 is clear". Therefore, there's a contradiction. But perhaps in this problem's context, "clear" means that the agent is not present. So even if a stone is there, the location is considered clear. Therefore, the agent can move into a location with a stone. But that would overwrite the stone, which isn't possible. So this must be an error.

Given that the problem states that the initial state is valid, I must proceed with the given information. Therefore, I have to assume that pos44 is clear (agent not there) even though the stone is there. Therefore, the agent can move into pos44. But when the agent moves into pos44, the stone is there, which would mean that the location is occupied by both, which is impossible. Therefore, perhaps there's a mistake, and the stone is not at pos44. But according to the problem, it is. Therefore, I'm stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps "clear" refers to the absence of the agent. So when the agent is not present, the location is clear, even if there's a stone. Therefore, when moving, the agent can move into a location with a stone, but that would require that the stone is pushed. But moving into a location with a stone would require a push action, not a move action. So the move action can only be used when the destination is clear (no agent or stone). Therefore, perhaps the initial state is correct, and pos44 has the stone but is considered clear, which can't be. Therefore, the problem's initial state is invalid. But since the problem gives it, I have to proceed.

This is very confusing. Let me recheck the problem's original state:

Original state:

- "stone1 is at location pos44"
- "Location pos44 is clear"

So according to the problem's own definitions, a location is clear if it's empty. But since stone1 is at pos44, it should not be clear. Therefore, this is a contradiction, which makes the problem invalid. But since this is a planning problem, perhaps I have to proceed under the assumption that "clear" is defined differently. Maybe "clear" means that the agent is not there. Therefore, even if a stone is present, the location is considered clear. So the agent can move into a location with a stone, but that's impossible. Therefore, the move action's preconditions require that the destination is clear (no agent), but stones are allowed. Therefore, the agent can move into a location with a stone. But that can't be, because the stone is there. So this suggests that the problem has an error. However, given that I have to find a solution, perhaps I should ignore this and proceed.

Assuming that the agent can move into a location with a stone, but that's not possible. Therefore, the correct way is that "clear" means the location has neither the agent nor a stone. So the initial state is wrong, but perhaps there's a typo. For example, maybe stone1 is at pos45 instead of pos44, but according to the problem, it's at pos44. Alternatively, perhaps pos44 is not a goal location, but pos54 is. So the goal is to get the stone to pos54.

Given all that, the agent needs to push the stone from pos44 to pos54. To do that, the agent needs to be at pos43 (to push right) or pos34 (to push down) or pos45 (to push up) or pos54 (to push left, but pos54 is a goal and pushing to a goal requires using pushtogoal, which would require that the destination is a goal. Wait, the stone is already at pos44, which is not a goal. We need to get it to pos54, which is a goal.

So to push the stone from pos44 to pos54, the agent needs to be adjacent to pos44 in the direction opposite to the push. For example, if pushing right to pos54, the agent must be at pos44's left (pos43) and push the stone right.

But first, the agent needs to get to pos43. Let's plan the path from pos25 to pos43.

Initial position: pos25.

Constraints:

- The agent must not be at pos24 in any state.
- At least once, the agent is at pos15 or pos43.
- At least once, the agent is at pos34.
- If the agent is at pos34, then in an earlier state, pos34 is not clear or stone1 is at pos55. But pos34's initial state is clear (since the agent is at pos25 and stone1 is at pos44, so pos34 is clear. So pos34 is initially clear. Therefore, if the agent moves to pos34, the condition requires that in an earlier state, either pos34 was not clear (which would require that before that, the agent or a stone was there) or stone1 was at pos55. Since pos55 is not a goal, but stone1 starts at pos44, this might be tricky.

Another constraint: The agent must be at pos44 at least once. And when that happens, there must have been an earlier state where pos12 was not clear. Initially, pos12 is clear, so pos12 must become not clear (i.e., have the agent or a stone there) at some point before the agent reaches pos44.

Also, there's a constraint that "pos24 is not clear" can only be true in at most one continuous sequence of states. So pos24 can be occupied (by agent or stone) only once, and any subsequent occupation must be after it's cleared again.

This is getting complicated. Let's outline the steps:

1. Move the agent to a position where they can push the stone to pos54.
2. Ensure all constraints are met during the process.

First, the agent is at pos25. Let's see possible paths to reach pos43.

From pos25, possible moves: dirleft to pos15, dirright to pos35, dirup to pos24 (forbidden).

So first, moving to pos35 (dirright). Then from pos35, possible moves: dirup to pos34, dirright to pos45.

If we go to pos34, then from pos34, can we go to pos33 (dirup), pos44 (dirright, but pos44 has the stone and is considered clear?), pos34 to pos34's possible directions. Wait, movement from pos34 can be to pos24 (dirleft, forbidden), pos44 (dirright, if clear), pos33 (dirup), or pos35 (dirdown).

But pos44 has the stone, and if "clear" means no agent, then pos44 is clear (since the agent isn't there). But can the agent move into pos44 even though there's a stone? If yes, then the agent could move there, but that's not possible because the stone is there. So this is conflicting.

Assuming that the agent can't move into a location with a stone, then the only way to get to pos43 is via a path that avoids stones. But since the stone is at pos44, and the agent needs to get to pos43, which is adjacent to pos44. Let's see.

Alternative path:

pos25 -> pos35 (dirright)

pos35 -> pos45 (dirright)

pos45 -> pos44 (dirup) [But pos44 has the stone; can't move there unless it's clear. If pos44 is considered clear (agent not there), but stone is present, then maybe the agent can move there. But then the stone would be there as well, which is impossible. So this is not allowed.

Alternatively, the agent can't move into pos44. So to reach pos43, the agent must go around.

Possible path: pos25 -> pos35 (dirright), pos35 -> pos34 (dirup), pos34 -> pos33 (dirup), pos33 -> pos32 (dirup), pos32 -> pos42 (dirright), pos42 -> pos43 (dirdown). Then the agent is at pos43.

But let's check the movement connections:

From pos25 to pos35: allowed.

pos35 to pos34: allowed (dirup).

pos34 to pos33: allowed via dirup? Let's check the movement rules. The allowed moves from pos34: You may move from pos34 to pos24 (dirleft), pos44 (dirright), pos33 (dirup), pos35 (dirdown). So yes, pos34 to pos33 is allowed via dirup.

pos33 to pos32: allowed via dirup? Looking at the movement rules for pos33: You can go to pos23 (dirleft), pos43 (dirright), pos32 (dirup), pos34 (dirdown). Wait, no. From pos33, the allowed directions are:

"You may move from location pos33 to location pos23 following direction dirleft"

"You may move from location pos33 to location pos43 following direction dirright"

"You may move from location pos33 to location pos32 following direction dirup"

"You may move from location pos33 to location pos34 following direction dirdown"

So pos33 to pos32 is via dirup. So that's allowed.

pos32 to pos42: movement rules for pos32: "You may move from location pos32 to location pos22 following direction dirleft", "You may move from location pos32 to location pos42 following direction dirright", etc. So yes, dirright to pos42.

pos42 to pos43: From pos42, allowed moves: pos32 (dirleft), pos52 (dirright), pos41 (dirup), pos43 (dirdown). So yes, dirdown to pos43.

So the path pos25 -> pos35 -> pos34 -> pos33 -> pos32 -> pos42 -> pos43.

Once at pos43, the agent can push the stone from pos44 to pos54 (dirright) using pushtogoal.

But before that, check constraints:

- The agent must be at pos15 or pos43 at least once. Since we're going to pos43, that condition is satisfied.

- The agent must be at pos34 at least once. The path goes through pos34 (from pos35 to pos34 to pos33). So that's covered.

- The agent must be at pos44 at least once. But according to the current plan, the agent is at pos43, then pushes the stone to pos54. So the agent would end up at pos44 after the push. Because when you push a stone, the agent moves into the stone's previous position. Wait, the effect of pushtogoal is: agent moves from l_p (pos43) to l_from (pos44), and the stone moves to l_to (pos54). So after pushing, the agent is at pos44.

So after the push, the agent is at pos44, which satisfies the constraint of being at pos44 at least once. However, the constraint says that if the agent is at pos44, there must have been an earlier state where pos12 was not clear. Initially, pos12 is clear. So we need to make pos12 not clear (agent or stone there) before the agent reaches pos44.

So the agent needs to visit pos12 or have the stone at pos12 before reaching pos44. But the stone starts at pos44 and is being moved to pos54. So the only way to make pos12 not clear is for the agent to be at pos12 at some point before reaching pos44.

But how can the agent get to pos12? Let's see.

From pos25, the agent could go to pos15 (dirleft), then pos14 (dirup), pos13 (dirup), pos12 (dirup), etc.

But this would require a different path. Let's consider:

Alternative path:

pos25 -> pos15 (dirleft)

pos15 -> pos14 (dirup)

pos14 -> pos13 (dirup)

pos13 -> pos12 (dirup)

Now the agent is at pos12, making pos12 not clear. Then, proceed to move to pos43 and push the stone. This would satisfy the constraint for pos44.

But this path would be longer. However, it's necessary to satisfy the constraint that when the agent is at pos44, there was a previous state where pos12 was not clear. So the agent must visit pos12 before reaching pos44.

So let's plan this:

1. Move from pos25 to pos15 (dirleft). Now at pos15. Check constraints: pos24 is not visited.

2. Move from pos15 to pos14 (dirup). Now at pos14.

3. Move from pos14 to pos13 (dirup). Now at pos13.

4. Move from pos13 to pos12 (dirup). Now at pos12. This makes pos12 not clear, satisfying the constraint for pos44.

Now, the agent is at pos12. Now, need to get to pos43.

From pos12, possible moves:

pos12 can go to pos22 (dirright), pos11 (dirup), pos13 (dirdown).

But we need to head towards pos43. So from pos12, perhaps move to pos22 (dirright), then pos32 (dirright), pos42 (dirright), pos43 (dirdown).

Let's see:

5. pos12 -> pos22 (dirright)

6. pos22 -> pos32 (dirright)

7. pos32 -> pos42 (dirright)

8. pos42 -> pos43 (dirdown). Now at pos43.

Then, perform the pushtogoal action to push stone1 from pos44 to pos54 dirright.

But wait, the stone is at pos44. The agent is at pos43. So l_p is pos43, l_from is pos44, l_to is pos54, direction from l_p to l_from is dirright, and direction from l_from to l_to is dirright. So the action would be:

pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos44 pos54 dirright.

After this action, the agent is at pos44 (from l_p pos43 to l_from pos44), the stone is at pos54 (goal location), which satisfies the goal. Also, the agent is now at pos44, which triggers the constraint that pos12 must have been not clear earlier. Which it was when the agent was at pos12.

Now, check other constraints:

- The constraint that the agent is not at pos24 in any state. Our path doesn't go near pos24.

- The agent must be at pos34 in at least one state. Our current path doesn't include pos34. So we need to adjust the plan to visit pos34.

Additionally, the constraint that if the agent is at pos34, there must be an earlier state where pos34 is not clear or stone1 is at pos55. But initially, pos34 is clear, and stone1 is at pos44. So if the agent moves to pos34, we need to have an earlier state where pos34 is not clear or stone1 is at pos55. But stone1 is being pushed to pos54, not pos55. So the only way is to have pos34 not clear before the agent gets there.

So perhaps the agent needs to move to pos34 after visiting pos12, but before moving to pos43. But how?

Alternatively, after visiting pos12, the agent could go through pos22 -> pos32 -> pos33 -> pos34.

Let's adjust the plan:

After step 4 (agent at pos12):

5. pos12 -> pos22 (dirright)

6. pos22 -> pos32 (dirright)

7. pos32 -> pos33 (dirdown) ?

Wait, from pos32, movement options include dirright to pos42, dirleft to pos22, dirup to pos31, dirdown to pos33. So pos32 -> pos33 via dirdown.

7. pos32 -> pos33 (dirdown)

8. pos33 -> pos34 (dirdown)

Now agent is at pos34. Now, check the constraint: if the agent is at pos34, there must be an earlier state where pos34 was not clear or stone1 is at pos55. Since pos34 was initially clear, we need to have made it not clear before. How?

Wait, when the agent moves into pos34, pos34 becomes not clear (since the agent is there). But the constraint requires that if the agent is at pos34 in some state, then there's an earlier state where pos34 was not clear (which would be before the agent arrived) or stone1 was at pos55. But before arriving at pos34, pos34 was clear. So this condition would not be met. Therefore, this path would violate the constraint.

Therefore, we need to ensure that before the agent reaches pos34, either pos34 was not clear (i.e., the agent or a stone was there) or stone1 is at pos55. Since stone1 starts at pos44 and we're moving it to pos54, we can't have stone1 at pos55. Therefore, the only option is to have pos34 not clear before the agent arrives.

But how? The agent could visit pos34, leave, and come back. But that would require pos34 to be not clear when the agent is there the first time. But the first time the agent is there, pos34 becomes not clear. Then, if the agent leaves, pos34 becomes clear again. So to satisfy the constraint, if the agent is at pos34 in a later state, there must have been an earlier state where pos34 was not clear. For example:

1. Agent moves to pos34, making it not clear. Then moves away, making it clear again. Later, when the agent returns to pos34, the previous state where pos34 was not clear (when the agent was there the first time) satisfies the condition.

But in this case, the agent's path would need to visit pos34 twice, which increases the plan length. Is there a way to do this without adding too many steps?

Alternatively, perhaps after the agent pushes the stone to pos54, the agent is at pos44. Then, the agent could move to pos34 via pos44's possible directions. But pos44 is now clear (stone is at pos54). Wait, after pushing, the agent is at pos44. From pos44, the agent can move to pos34 (dirleft), pos54 (dirright, but pos54 has the stone), pos43 (dirup), or pos45 (dirdown). But pos54 is now occupied by the stone, so moving there would require a push action. But the stone is already at a goal, so perhaps it's done.

So after the push, the agent is at pos44. To visit pos34, the agent can move to pos34 (dirleft). Then, the agent is at pos34. But according to the constraint, there must be an earlier state where pos34 was not clear. The first time the agent is at pos34 is after the push, which is in the same plan. Wait, no. If the agent moves to pos34 after the push, then the first time they're at pos34 is after the push. So the constraint would require that before that, pos34 was not clear. But before that, pos34 was clear (except when the agent passed through earlier).

Wait, in the initial plan where the agent goes through pos34 (earlier steps), then pos34 is visited before the push. But that would require the agent to be at pos34 before pushing the stone. Let's try to adjust the path:

Original path:

pos25 -> pos15 -> pos14 -> pos13 -> pos12 (step 4)

pos12 -> pos22 (step5)

pos22 -> pos32 (step6)

pos32 -> pos33 (step7)

pos33 -> pos34 (step8)

But at step8, agent is at pos34. Now, we need to have an earlier state where pos34 is not clear. But before step8, pos34 was clear. So this would violate the constraint. Therefore, this path is invalid.

Alternative approach: Make pos34 not clear before the agent arrives there. How? The agent could push a stone to pos34, but there's only one stone. But the stone is at pos44. To push it to pos34, the agent would need to be at pos44's left (pos43), and push left to pos34. But that requires the agent to be at pos43, which is part of the path. So maybe:

After step4 (agent at pos12), instead of going directly to pos22, go back to pos13, pos14, pos15, pos25, then to pos35, pos34.

But this seems convoluted. Let's think:

Alternative path:

pos25 -> pos15 (step1)

pos15 -> pos14 (step2)

pos14 -> pos13 (step3)

pos13 -> pos12 (step4)

pos12 -> pos13 (step5, dirup)

pos13 -> pos14 (step6, dirup)

pos14 -> pos15 (step7, dirup)

pos15 -> pos25 (step8, dirup)

pos25 -> pos35 (step9, dirright)

pos35 -> pos34 (step10, dirup)

Now, agent is at pos34. But before that, pos34 was clear. So the constraint is violated. Therefore, this doesn't help.

Alternatively, the agent could push the stone to pos34, making it not clear. But the stone is at pos44. To push it to pos34, the agent needs to be at pos44's left (pos43), and push left to pos34. But to get to pos43, the agent needs to go through the same path as before. So:

But this seems like a catch-22. Maybe the plan needs to be:

1. Move agent to pos43.

2. Push stone from pos44 to pos34 (using pushtonongoal, since pos34 is not a goal).

3. Then move the stone from pos34 to pos54.

But this would require more steps and may not be optimal.

Alternatively, perhaps the agent can first push the stone to pos34, then to pos44, then to pos54. But that's adding unnecessary steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the agent can visit pos34 after the stone has been moved there. But the stone is at pos44 initially. So to push it to pos34, the agent needs to be at pos43 and push left. But how to get to pos43?

This is getting too complicated. Let's try to find a path that satisfies all constraints step by step.

First, the constraints:

1. At least once, agent is at pos15 or pos43.

   Solved by visiting pos43 during the plan.

2. Agent is never at pos24.

   Avoid moving to pos24.

3. At least once, agent is at pos34.

   Need to visit pos34.

4. If agent is at pos34, there must have been an earlier state where pos34 is not clear or stone1 is at pos55.

   Since stone1 is at pos44 and moves to pos54, the only way is to have pos34 not clear before.

   So, agent must visit pos34, leave, then come back. Or have the stone at pos34 before.

5. At least once, agent is at pos44.

   Achieved after pushing the stone to pos54.

6. If agent is at pos44, there must have been an earlier state where pos12 is not clear.

   So agent must visit pos12 before reaching pos44.

7. "pos24 is not clear" can be true in at most one continuous sequence.

   Ensure that pos24 is only occupied once and not again.

Also, the optimal plan is required, so we need the shortest possible plan.

Let's try to construct the plan step by step.

First, agent must visit pos12 to satisfy constraint 6. So:

Step 1: move player1 from pos25 to pos15 (dirleft)

Step 2: move player1 from pos15 to pos14 (dirup)

Step 3: move player1 from pos14 to pos13 (dirup)

Step 4: move player1 from pos13 to pos12 (dirup). Now, pos12 is not clear. This satisfies the requirement for constraint 6.

Next, need to reach pos43 to push the stone. From pos12, go to pos22 (dirright), then pos32 (dirright), then pos42 (dirright), then pos43 (dirdown).

Step 5: move player1 from pos12 to pos22 (dirright)

Step 6: move player1 from pos22 to pos32 (dirright)

Step 7: move player1 from pos32 to pos42 (dirright)

Step 8: move player1 from pos42 to pos43 (dirdown). Now at pos43.

Now, push the stone from pos44 to pos54:

Step 9: pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos44 pos54 dirright.

After this action, the agent is at pos44, and the stone is at pos54 (goal). This satisfies the main goal.

But we need to visit pos34 at least once. So after step 9, the agent is at pos44. From there, can move to pos34 (dirleft):

Step 10: move player1 from pos44 to pos34 (dirleft).

But before step 10, we need to ensure that when the agent is at pos34, there's an earlier state where pos34 was not clear or stone1 was at pos55. However, pos34 was clear until step 10. So this violates the constraint.

Therefore, we need to visit pos34 before step 10 in a way that satisfies the constraint.

Alternative approach: After step 8 (agent at pos43), before pushing the stone, visit pos34.

But how? From pos43, the agent can move to pos33 (dirup), then pos34 (dirdown).

Step 9: move player1 from pos43 to pos33 (dirup).

Step 10: move player1 from pos33 to pos34 (dirdown). Now at pos34.

But now, we need to check constraint 4. At this point, the agent is at pos34. The earlier state must have pos34 not clear or stone1 at pos55. But pos34 was clear before this step, and stone1 is at pos44. Therefore, this violates the constraint.

Thus, this path is invalid.

Alternative idea: Before visiting pos34, have the agent or the stone at pos34. Since the stone is at pos44, the agent could push it to pos34 first, then to pos54. But this would require:

Step 9: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos44 pos34 dirleft. (pushes stone from pos44 to pos34, which is a non-goal location).

Then, the agent is at pos44, and the stone is at pos34. Now, to move the stone from pos34 to pos54, the agent needs to get to pos34's adjacent position. For example, pos33, pos44, etc.

But this adds steps and may not be optimal.

Let's see:

After step 8 (agent at pos43):

Step 9: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos44 pos34 dirleft. Now, stone is at pos34, agent is at pos44.

Now, agent is at pos44, which satisfies constraint 5 (must be at pos44 at least once). Also, since we visited pos12 earlier (step4), constraint 6 is satisfied.

Now, need to move the stone from pos34 to pos54. To do that, the agent needs to be at pos34's adjacent location. From pos44, the agent can move to pos34 (dirleft).

Step 10: move player1 from pos44 to pos34 (dirleft). Now at pos34.

But pos34 is occupied by the stone. So the agent can't move there. Wait, no, after step9, the stone is at pos34, and the agent is at pos44. So pos34 is not clear (has stone), so the agent can't move there. So step10 is invalid.

Therefore, after step9, the agent is at pos44, stone is at pos34. To push the stone from pos34 to pos44 again, but that doesn't help.

Alternatively, the agent can move to pos43 (from pos44, dirup?), but pos44's movement options are:

From pos44, can move to pos34 (dirleft), pos54 (dirright, but stone is at pos34 now), pos43 (dirup), pos45 (dirdown).

So from pos44, agent can move to pos43.

Step 10: move player1 from pos44 to pos43 (dirup).

Then, from pos43, move to pos33 (dirup), then to pos34 (dirdown), but pos34 has the stone. So agent can't move there.

Alternatively, push the stone from pos34 to pos44 again:

But that would require the agent to be at pos34's adjacent location. For example, pos33.

Agent needs to move from pos43 to pos33 (dirup), then to pos34 (dirdown) â€” but pos34 is occupied by the stone. So can't move there.

Alternatively, the agent can push the stone from pos34 to pos44 (dirright), but to do that, the agent needs to be at pos34's left (pos33), and push right. So:

Agent moves from pos43 to pos33 (dirup), then to pos34 (dirdown) â€” but pos34 is occupied by the stone, so can't move there. So this is impossible.

This approach is getting too complicated and may not lead to an optimal plan.

Alternative idea: Incorporate visiting pos34 into the initial path, ensuring that the constraint is satisfied.

After step8 (agent at pos43), but before pushing the stone, agent moves to pos34 via a different route that requires pos34 to have been not clear earlier.

But how?

Perhaps after step4 (agent at pos12), instead of going directly to pos43, take a detour to pos34.

But how? From pos12, go to pos22, pos32, pos33, pos34.

Steps:

4. agent at pos12.

5. pos12 -> pos22 (dirright)

6. pos22 -> pos32 (dirright)

7. pos32 -> pos33 (dirdown)

8. pos33 -> pos34 (dirdown). Now at pos34.

But now, agent is at pos34, which requires that there's an earlier state where pos34 was not clear. But pos34 was clear before. So this violates constraint 4.

Therefore, this path is invalid.

Alternative approach: Have the stone at pos34 before the agent arrives there. But the stone starts at pos44. So the agent would need to push the stone to pos34 first.

But to push the stone from pos44 to pos34, the agent needs to be at pos43 and push left.

So after step8 (agent at pos43):

Step9: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos44 pos34 dirleft. Now, stone is at pos34, agent is at pos44.

Then, agent can move to pos34 (dirleft) â€” but pos34 is occupied by the stone. Can't.

Alternatively, the agent can push the stone from pos34 to pos44 again, but that's redundant.

Alternatively, push the stone from pos34 to pos54. To do that, the agent needs to be at pos34's east (pos44) and push east. But pos34 is at pos34, and east would be pos44. But stone is at pos34, so to push east to pos44, agent must be at pos34's west (pos33), but pos34's west is pos33. So:

Agent is at pos44. To push the stone from pos34 to pos44, the agent must be at pos33 and push east. But the agent is at pos44. So agent needs to move to pos33.

From pos44, agent can move to pos43 (dirup), then to pos33 (dirup).

Step10: move player1 from pos44 to pos43 (dirup)

Step11: move player1 from pos43 to pos33 (dirup)

Step12: pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos34 pos44 dirright. But pos44 is not a goal location. So this would require using pushtonongoal. But pos44 is a non-goal location. So step12: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos34 pos44 dirright. Now, stone is at pos44 again, agent at pos34.

But now, the stone is back where it started. This is not helpful.

This is getting too complicated. Perhaps the optimal plan is to find a way to visit pos34 after the stone has been moved there, but that requires additional steps and may not be optimal.

Alternatively, maybe the constraint about pos34 can be satisfied by having the agent visit pos34 after the stone has been pushed to pos54, but that doesn't help because the stone is already at pos54.

Given the time constraints, perhaps the optimal plan is to proceed with the initial path that visits pos12 and then pos43, but also includes a visit to pos34 after pushing the stone, even though it violates the constraint. But that's not possible. Therefore, I must find a way to satisfy all constraints.

Alternative Idea:

After pushing the stone to pos54 (agent at pos44), the agent can move to pos34. But to satisfy the constraint, there must have been a previous state where pos34 was not clear. How? The agent was at pos44, then moves to pos34. But pos34 was clear before. Therefore, this violates the constraint.

Alternatively, after pushing the stone to pos54, the agent can move to pos34 via pos44 and pos34. But that doesn't help the constraint.

Maybe the only way is to visit pos34 twice. Once before the push (making pos34 not clear), then after. So:

Plan:

Steps to visit pos12, then pos34, then pos43, then push.

But how?

1. move pos25 to pos15 (dirleft)

2. move pos15 to pos14 (dirup)

3. move pos14 to pos13 (dirup)

4. move pos13 to pos12 (dirup) â†’ satisfies pos12 not clear.

5. move pos12 to pos22 (dirright)

6. move pos22 to pos32 (dirright)

7. move pos32 to pos42 (dirright)

8. move pos42 to pos43 (dirdown)

9. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos44 pos54 dirright â†’ agent at pos44, stone at pos54.

10. move pos44 to pos34 (dirleft) â†’ now at pos34.

But when the agent is at pos34 (step10), there must have been a previous state where pos34 was not clear. But before step10, pos34 was only visited in step10. So no.

Alternative Idea: Make a loop where the agent visits pos34 before the push, leaves, then returns.

For example:

After step4 (agent at pos12):

5. move pos12 to pos13 (dirdown)

6. move pos13 to pos14 (dirdown)

7. move pos14 to pos15 (dirdown)

8. move pos15 to pos25 (dirdown)

9. move pos25 to pos35 (dirright)

10. move pos35 to pos34 (dirup) â†’ now at pos34.

Now, agent is at pos34 (step10). This requires that there's an earlier state where pos34 was not clear. But before step10, pos34 was clear. So this violates the constraint.

So this approach doesn't work.

Given the time I've spent and the complexity, perhaps the optimal plan is as follows, even if it violates some constraints, but I must find a way to satisfy them.

Wait, perhaps the constraint regarding pos34 can be satisfied if the agent visits pos34 after the stone has been moved there. But the stone is moved to pos54, not pos34.

Alternatively, during the pushing action, the stone moves to pos54, and the agent is at pos44. Then, the agent moves to pos34. But pos34 was clear before, so this violates the constraint.

I'm stuck. Maybe there's a different approach.

Alternative Plan:

Agent starts at pos25.

1. move to pos35 (dirright).

2. move to pos34 (dirup). Now at pos34. But this violates the constraint because there's no earlier state where pos34 was not clear or stone1 is at pos55.

Therefore, this step is invalid.

Another Idea:

The agent can move to pos34, then move away, then come back. For example:

1. move pos25 to pos35 (dirright).

2. move pos35 to pos34 (dirup) â†’ pos34 now not clear.

3. move pos34 to pos35 (dirdown) â†’ pos34 clear again.

4. move pos35 to pos34 (dirup) â†’ now at pos34 again. Now, the earlier state (step2) had pos34 not clear, satisfying the constraint.

But this requires adding steps. However, this may be necessary.

Let's see:

Steps:

1. move player1 pos25 pos35 dirright

2. move player1 pos35 pos34 dirup â†’ now at pos34. Constraint requires that there's an earlier state where pos34 was not clear. But before step2, pos34 was clear. So violates the constraint.

Therefore, even after leaving and returning, the first visit to pos34 would violate the constraint.

Therefore, the only way to satisfy the constraint is to have the stone at pos34 before the agent arrives there. But the stone starts at pos44.

Therefore, the agent must push the stone to pos34 before arriving there.

So:

Steps:

1. move pos25 to pos35 (dirright).

2. move pos35 to pos45 (dirright).

3. move pos45 to pos44 (dirup). But pos44 has the stone. Assuming that "clear" means the agent can move there if it's clear (i.e., no agent), then pos44 is clear (agent not there), but there's a stone. But moving into pos44 would require that it's clear (no agent), but there's a stone, which is not allowed. Therefore, this is invalid.

Alternative Idea: Push the stone from pos44 to pos34.

To do that, the agent needs to be at pos43 and push left to pos34.

But to get to pos43, the agent needs to go through the earlier path.

So:

1. move pos25 to pos35 (dirright).

2. move pos35 to pos34 (dirup).

But this violates the constraint.

Alternatively, the agent must take the long path to pos43, push the stone to pos34, then move to pos34.

So:

Steps:

1. move pos25 to pos15 (dirleft).

2. move pos15 to pos14 (dirup).

3. move pos14 to pos13 (dirup).

4. move pos13 to pos12 (dirup).

5. move pos12 to pos22 (dirright).

6. move pos22 to pos32 (dirright).

7. move pos32 to pos42 (dirright).

8. move pos42 to pos43 (dirdown).

9. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos44 pos34 dirleft. Now, stone is at pos34, agent at pos44.

10. move pos44 to pos34 (dirleft). But pos34 is occupied by the stone. Can't move there.

Therefore, this is invalid.

Hmm. This is extremely challenging. Given the time I've spent, I'll try to propose a plan that meets all constraints, even if it's longer.

Final Plan Steps:

1. move player1 pos25 pos15 dirleft â†’ agent at pos15.

2. move player1 pos15 pos14 dirup â†’ pos14.

3. move player1 pos14 pos13 dirup â†’ pos13.

4. move player1 pos13 pos12 dirup â†’ pos12. Now pos12 is not clear (constraint for pos44 is met).

5. move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown â†’ pos13.

6. move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown â†’ pos14.

7. move player1 pos14 pos15 dirdown â†’ pos15.

8. move player1 pos15 pos25 dirdown â†’ pos25.

9. move player1 pos25 pos35 dirright â†’ pos35.

10. move player1 pos35 pos34 dirup â†’ pos34. Now, the agent is at pos34. But this violates constraint 4 because before step10, pos34 was clear.

Therefore, this path is invalid.

Alternative Idea: After step4 (agent at pos12), move to pos22, then pos32, then pos33, then pos34.

Steps:

1. move player1 pos25 pos15 dirleft.

2. move player1 pos15 pos14 dirup.

3. move player1 pos14 pos13 dirup.

4. move player1 pos13 pos12 dirup. â†’ pos12.

5. move player1 pos12 pos22 dirright.

6. move player1 pos22 pos32 dirright.

7. move player1 pos32 pos33 dirdown.

8. move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown. â†’ pos34. Now, violates constraint4.

Therefore, this is invalid.

Given all the time I've spent and the complexity, I think the optimal plan is as follows, even though it might not satisfy all constraints, but I must ensure it does:

The key constraints are:

- The agent must visit pos34 at least once.

- When visiting pos34, there must be an earlier state where pos34 was not clear or stone1 is at pos55.

- The agent must visit pos44 after visiting pos12 when pos12 was not clear.

- The agent must visit pos15 or pos43.

- The agent must not visit pos24.

Assuming that after pushing the stone to pos54, the agent moves to pos34, which requires that there was an earlier state where pos34 was not clear. But pos34 was clear before, unless the agent visited it earlier. So perhaps the only way is to have the agent visit pos34 twice: once before pushing the stone (making pos34 not clear), then leave, then come back. But this requires additional steps.

Final Plan:

1. move player1 pos25 pos15 dirleft.

2. move player1 pos15 pos14 dirup.

3. move player1 pos14 pos13 dirup.

4. move player1 pos13 pos12 dirup. â†’ pos12 not clear.

5. move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown.

6. move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown.

7. move player1 pos14 pos15 dirdown.

8. move player1 pos15 pos25 dirdown.

9. move player1 pos25 pos35 dirright.

10. move player1 pos35 pos34 dirup. â†’ pos34. Violates constraint4.

So this is invalid.

Given the time I've spent and the complexity, I think the correct plan involves visiting pos43 and pos34 in the process, but I'm not able to satisfy all constraints. However, the correct answer must satisfy all constraints. 

After careful consideration, the valid plan is:

```

move player1 pos25 pos35 dirright
move player1 pos35 pos34 dirup
move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup
move player1 pos33 pos32 dirup
move player1 pos32 pos42 dirright
move player1 pos42 pos43 dirdown
pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos44 pos54 dirright
move player1 pos44 pos34 dirleft
```

But this plan may not satisfy all constraints. For example, the agent visits pos34 (step 2 and step 8). The first visit to pos34 (step2) has no earlier state where pos34 was not clear. Therefore, this violates constraint4.

Given that I'm struggling to find a plan that meets all constraints, I think the intended solution involves moving to pos43 to push the stone, which satisfies the pos43 visit, and then moving to pos34 after the push, but ensuring the constraint for pos34 is met. However, how?

Wait, when the agent pushes the stone to pos54, they are at pos44. Then, moving to pos34 (dirleft) would require that in the previous state, pos34 was not clear. But pos34 was clear before the agent moved there. So this violates the constraint.

Therefore, the correct solution must include a step where pos34 is not clear before the agent moves there. The only way is to have the stone at pos34, but that requires pushing it there first, which complicates the plan.

After extensive analysis, the correct plan is:

```

move player1 pos25 pos35 dirright
move player1 pos35 pos34 dirup
move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup
move player1 pos33 pos32 dirup
move player1 pos32 pos42 dirright
move player1 pos42 pos43 dirdown
pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos44 pos54 dirright
move player1 pos44 pos34 dirleft
```

But this violates the constraint regarding pos34. Therefore, the correct plan must be different. Given the time I've spent, I think the intended solution is:

The agent moves to pos43 via pos35, pos34, etc., pushes the stone to pos54, and visits pos34 after the push. But I'm not sure. Given the time, I'll provide the following plan, but it may not meet all constraints:

```

move player1 pos25 pos35 dirright
move player1 pos35 pos34 dirup
move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup
move player1 pos33 pos32 dirup
move player1 pos32 pos42 dirright
move player1 pos42 pos43 dirdown
pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos44 pos54 dirright
move player1 pos44 pos34 dirleft
```

This plan moves the agent to pos34 after the push, but violates the constraint for pos34. Therefore, the correct answer must be different. I'm unable to proceed further without more time.
