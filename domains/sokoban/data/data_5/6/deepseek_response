This plan moves the agent from pos25 to pos35, then to pos34 (satisfying the requirement to be at pos34 once), then to pos33, pos32, pos42, and pos43. The agent then pushes the stone to the goal pos54. The push action also moves the agent to pos44, satisfying the constraint to be there. The earlier move to pos34 meets the "at least once" requirement, and the move to pos43 satisfies the "pos15 or pos43" constraint. The agent never visits pos24, and pos24's clear status is not violated.
