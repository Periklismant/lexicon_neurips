Alright, I need to solve a Sokoban-like planning problem. Let me break down the problem:

- We have a 5x5 grid (positions pos11, pos12, ..., pos55).
- There's a player (player1) and a stone (stone1).
- The player can move around the grid.
- The player can push the stone either to a goal location or to a non-goal location.
- The goal is to have the stone at a goal location.

Given the information provided:
- Player1 starts at pos42.
- Stone1 starts at pos32.
- There's only one goal location: pos13.

Now, I need to plan a sequence of actions to move the stone from pos32 to pos13.

First, let's visualize the grid:

```
(1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (1,4) (1,5)
(2,1) (2,2) (2,3) (2,4) (2,5)
(3,1) (3,2G) (3,3) (3,4) (3,5)
(4,1) (4,2P) (4,3) (4,4) (4,5)
(5,1) (5,2) (5,3) (5,4) (5,5)
```

where P is the player and G is the stone.

Wait, I think there's a mistake in how I visualized this. Let me make sure I understand the positions. The format seems to be `posXY` where X is the row and Y is the column. So pos32 would be at row 3, column 2.

Actually, let me rebuild the grid based on the directions given:

```
(1,1) (1,2) (1,3)G (1,4) (1,5)
(2,1) (2,2) (2,3) (2,4) (2,5)
(3,1) (3,2)S (3,3) (3,4) (3,5)
(4,1) (4,2)P (4,3) (4,4) (4,5)
(5,1) (5,2) (5,3) (5,4) (5,5)
```

where P is the player, S is the stone, and G marks the goal location.

Now I need to figure out how to move the stone from pos32 to pos13.

Let's trace a possible path:
1. Player is at pos42.
2. Stone is at pos32.
3. Goal is at pos13.

To push the stone from pos32, the player must be on the opposite side of the direction we want to push. If we want to push the stone upwards (towards pos22), the player must be at pos42. If we want to push the stone to the left (towards pos31), the player must be at pos33. And so on.

It seems like a reasonable path would be to push the stone upwards (to pos22), then left (to pos21), then up (to pos11), then right (to pos12), and finally right again (to pos13).

Let's plan the moves step by step:

First, the player is already at pos42, and the stone is at pos32. So the player is in position to push the stone upwards.

1. Push stone upwards to pos22: "pushtonongaol player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos22 dirup"
2. Player is now at pos32. Move player left: "move player1 pos32 pos31 dirleft"
3. Player is now at pos31. Push stone left to pos21: "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos22 pos21 dirleft"
4. Player is now at pos22. Push stone upwards to pos11: "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos21 pos11 dirup"
5. Player is now at pos21. Move player to the right: "move player1 pos21 pos22 dirdown"
6. Player is now at pos22. Move player to the right again: "move player1 pos22 pos23 dirdown"
7. Player is now at pos23. Move player upwards: "move player1 pos23 pos13 dirleft"
8. Player is now at pos13. Move player to the left: "move player1 pos13 pos12 dirup"
9. Player is now at pos12. Push stone to the right to pos12: "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos12 pos11 pos12 dirright"
10. Player is now at pos11. Push stone to the right to pos13 (goal): "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos11 pos12 pos13 dirright"

Wait, I need to be careful of the directions here. Let me re-read the directions and make sure I'm getting them right.

It seems there are four directions: dirup, dirdown, dirleft, and dirright.

For example:
"You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright"
"You may move from location pos11 to location pos12 following direction dirdown"

This means from pos11, going right leads to pos21 and going down leads to pos12.

So, if we label our grid with positions:

```
pos11 pos12 pos13 pos14 pos15
pos21 pos22 pos23 pos24 pos25
pos31 pos32 pos33 pos34 pos35
pos41 pos42 pos43 pos44 pos45
pos51 pos52 pos53 pos54 pos55
```

Now, the directions make more sense:
- dirup: Moving upwards in the grid (decreasing the row number)
- dirdown: Moving downwards in the grid (increasing the row number)
- dirleft: Moving to the left in the grid (decreasing the column number)
- dirright: Moving to the right in the grid (increasing the column number)

Based on this understanding, I think my visualization was incorrect. Let me correct it:

```
pos11 pos12 pos13(G) pos14 pos15
pos21 pos22 pos23 pos24 pos25
pos31 pos32(S) pos33 pos34 pos35
pos41 pos42(P) pos43 pos44 pos45
pos51 pos52 pos53 pos54 pos55
```

where P is the player, S is the stone, and G marks the goal location.

Wait, I'm reading the directions again and I think my initial understanding was also incorrect. For example:
"You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright"
"You may move from location pos11 to location pos12 following direction dirdown"

If pos11 is at the top-left of the grid, then moving right would lead to pos12, not pos21. And moving down would lead to pos21, not pos12.

So, I think the correct grid layout is:

```
pos11 pos12 pos13 pos14 pos15
pos21 pos22 pos23 pos24 pos25
pos31 pos32 pos33 pos34 pos35
pos41 pos42 pos43 pos44 pos45
pos51 pos52 pos53 pos54 pos55
```

But the directions are:
- dirup: Moving upwards in the grid (decreasing the first coordinate)
- dirdown: Moving downwards in the grid (increasing the first coordinate)
- dirleft: Moving to the left in the grid (decreasing the second coordinate)
- dirright: Moving to the right in the grid (increasing the second coordinate)

So if we're at pos11, moving right leads to pos12, moving down leads to pos21.

However, something seems off. Let me check the given direction information again:

"You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright"
"You may move from location pos11 to location pos12 following direction dirdown"

The directions given are inconsistent with my understanding. Let's try again:

If we're at pos11 and want to move to pos21, the direction is apparently dirright. But this should be moving to the bottom of the grid, not to the right. And if we're at pos11 and want to move to pos12, which should be to the right, the direction is dirdown.

Wait, maybe the positions are labeled differently than I thought. Maybe the first index is the column and the second index is the row. Let's try that:

```
pos11 pos21 pos31 pos41 pos51
pos12 pos22 pos32 pos42 pos52
pos13 pos23 pos33 pos43 pos53
pos14 pos24 pos34 pos44 pos54
pos15 pos25 pos35 pos45 pos55
```

Now, if we're at pos11 and move right, we get to pos21. If we're at pos11 and move down, we get to pos12. This seems consistent with the directions given.

So, the player starts at pos42 (row 2, column 4), the stone is at pos32 (row 2, column 3), and the goal is at pos13 (row 3, column 1).

Let's visualize this again:

```
pos11 pos21 pos31 pos41 pos51
pos12 pos22 pos32(S) pos42(P) pos52
pos13(G) pos23 pos33 pos43 pos53
pos14 pos24 pos34 pos44 pos54
pos15 pos25 pos35 pos45 pos55
```

I'm having a hard time figuring out the exact directions based on the given information. Let me try again with a fresh perspective.

In the context of the problem, we have a player starting at pos42 and a stone at pos32. The goal location is pos13.

The movement directions are given, and I can trace how one can move from one position to another. Let me just refactor this without speculating too much about the exact grid layout.

From the player's starting position at pos42, I need to figure out a sequence of moves to push the stone to the goal location at pos13.

First, let's get into a position to push the stone. The player is already at pos42 and the stone is at pos32. According to the problem, to push the stone, the player must be on the opposite side of the direction in which we want to push.

To push the stone towards pos22, the player must be at pos42, which is the current position. So, the player can directly push the stone from pos32 to pos22.

Using "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos22 dirleft", the player will push the stone from pos32 to pos22, and the player will then be at pos32.

Actually, I should be more careful about the directions. The problem specifies the directions in certain ways, and I should follow those.

For example, "You may move from location pos32 to location pos22 following direction dirleft". This means the direction from pos32 to pos22 is dirleft. So, to push the stone from pos32 to pos22, I would use the direction dirleft.

So, let's retry the pushing: Using "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos22 dirleft", the player will push the stone from pos32 to pos22, and the player will then be at pos32.

Let me continue with the rest of the plan:

1. Push stone from pos32 to pos22: "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos22 dirleft"
2. Player is now at pos32. From the problem, we know "You may move from location pos32 to location pos22 following direction dirleft", which means to go from pos32 to pos22, the direction is dirleft. But we also know "You may move from location pos22 to location pos12 following direction dirleft". So, to go from pos22 to pos12, the direction is also dirleft. Following this pattern, to push the stone from pos22 to pos12, the player would need to be at pos32 (which they already are) and the direction would be dirleft.
3. Push stone from pos22 to pos12: "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos22 pos12 dirleft"
4. Player is now at pos22. To push the stone from pos12 to pos13, we need to determine the direction. We know "You may move from location pos12 to location pos13 following direction dirdown", which means the direction from pos12 to pos13 is dirdown.
5. Player needs to move to a position to push the stone from pos12 to pos13. Let's verify "You may move from location pos22 to location pos12 following direction dirleft". So the player can move directly from pos22 to pos12 with direction dirleft, and then needs to be on the other side to push.
6. Move player to pos12: "move player1 pos22 pos12 dirleft"
7. Player now needs to move to a position that allows pushing the stone from pos12 to pos13. But the player is already at pos12, and the stone is also at pos12. This doesn't make sense. Let me reevaluate.

I realized that my understanding of the grid might be incorrect, and as a result, my plan isn't working out. Let me go back to the basics and understand the grid better.

From the directions, we know:
"You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright"
"You may move from location pos11 to location pos12 following direction dirdown"

This suggests a grid layout like:

```
pos11 -- dirright --> pos21 -- dirright --> pos31 -- dirright --> pos41 -- dirright --> pos51
  |
dirdown
  v
pos12 -- dirright --> pos22 -- dirright --> pos32 -- dirright --> pos42 -- dirright --> pos52
  |
dirdown
  v
pos13 -- dirright --> pos23 -- dirright --> pos33 -- dirright --> pos43 -- dirright --> pos53
  |
dirdown
  v
pos14 -- dirright --> pos24 -- dirright --> pos34 -- dirright --> pos44 -- dirright --> pos54
  |
dirdown
  v
pos15 -- dirright --> pos25 -- dirright --> pos35 -- dirright --> pos45 -- dirright --> pos55
```

Now, the player starts at pos42, which is on the 4th row, 2nd column. The stone is at pos32, which is on the 3rd row, 2nd column. The goal is at pos13, which is on the 1st row, 3rd column.

Let's visualize the initial state:

```
pos11 pos21 pos31 pos41 pos51
pos12 pos22 pos32 pos42(P) pos52
pos13(G) pos23 pos33 pos43 pos53
pos14 pos24 pos34 pos44 pos54
pos15 pos25 pos35 pos45 pos55
```

where P is the player, S is the stone, and G marks the goal location.

Wait, I missed marking the stone. Let me correct that:

```
pos11 pos21 pos31 pos41 pos51
pos12 pos22 pos32(S) pos42(P) pos52
pos13(G) pos23 pos33 pos43 pos53
pos14 pos24 pos34 pos44 pos54
pos15 pos25 pos35 pos45 pos55
```

Now that I have a clearer understanding, let's plan the path from the stone's initial position to the goal.

One possible path to move the stone from pos32 to pos13 is:
pos32 -> pos22 -> pos12 -> pos13

Now, let's determine how to move the player to make this happen.

The player starts at pos42, which is right next to the stone. To push the stone from pos32 to pos22, the player must be at pos42 (which they already are) and the direction is dirleft.

1. Push stone from pos32 to pos22: "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos22 dirleft"
2. Player is now at pos32. Next, to push the stone from pos22 to pos12, the player must be at pos32 (which they already are) and the direction is again dirleft.
3. Push stone from pos22 to pos12: "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos22 pos12 dirleft"
4. Player is now at pos22. Next, to push the stone from pos12 to pos13, the player must be at pos12 and the direction is dirdown.
5. Move player from pos22 to pos12: "move player1 pos22 pos12 dirleft"
6. Push stone from pos12 to pos13: "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos12 pos12 pos13 dirdown"

But wait, in step 6, both the player and the stone are at the same position (pos12), which doesn't make sense. I've made a mistake somewhere.

First of all, the player is at pos42 and the stone is at pos32. To push the stone, the player needs to be on the opposite side from the direction in which we want to push. If we want to push the stone to the left (towards pos22), the player needs to be on the right side of the stone (pos42).

Let's rethink:

1. Player at pos42 pushes stone from pos32 to pos22: "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos22 dirleft"
2. After this, the player is at pos32. The stone is at pos22.
3. To push the stone from pos22 to pos12, the player must be at pos32 (which they already are) and the direction is dirleft.
4. Push stone from pos22 to pos12: "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos22 pos12 dirleft"
5. After this, the player is at pos22. The stone is at pos12.
6. To push the stone from pos12 to pos13, which is down from pos12, the player must be above pos12, which is pos11. But the player is currently at pos22.
7. So, the player needs to move from pos22 to pos11. There's a connection "You may move from location pos22 to location pos12 following direction dirleft" and "You may move from location pos12 to location pos11 following direction dirup".
8. Move player from pos22 to pos12: "move player1 pos22 pos12 dirleft"
9. Move player from pos12 to pos11: "move player1 pos12 pos11 dirup"
10. Push stone from pos12 to pos13: "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos11 pos12 pos13 dirdown"

Wait, I'm making a confusion again. Let me reread the action descriptions to better understand how the pushing works.

"pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": You may only perform this action if (i) agent p is at location l_p, (ii) stone s is at location l_from, (iii) location l_to is clear, (iv) you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d, (v) you can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d, and (vi) location l_to is a goal location.

So, for the pushing action, the agent must be at a location l_p, and to push the stone, the direction d is the same for both going from l_p to l_from and from l_from to l_to.

Now, let's replan:

1. Player is at pos42 and wants to push the stone from pos32 to pos22. The direction from pos42 to pos32 is dirleft. The direction from pos32 to pos22 is also dirleft. This matches the requirements for pushing. So, "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos22 dirleft"
2. After this, the player is at pos32. The stone is at pos22.
3. To push the stone from pos22 to pos12, the direction from pos32 to pos22 is dirleft. The direction from pos22 to pos12 is also dirleft. So, "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos22 pos12 dirleft"
4. After this, the player is at pos22. The stone is at pos12.
5. To push the stone from pos12 to pos13, we need the direction from some location l_p to pos12 to be the same as the direction from pos12 to pos13. We know "You may move from location pos12 to location pos13 following direction dirdown", so the direction is dirdown. We need to find a location l_p where "You may move from location l_p to location pos12 following direction dirdown". One such location is pos11.
6. So, the player needs to move from pos22 to pos11. From pos22, we can move to pos12 using dirleft, and from pos12 to pos11 using dirup.
7. Move player from pos22 to pos12: "move player1 pos22 pos12 dirleft"
8. Move player from pos12 to pos11: "move player1 pos12 pos11 dirup"
9. Push stone from pos12 to pos13: "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos11 pos12 pos13 dirdown"

But wait, this doesn't make sense. If the player is at pos11 and goes dirdown, they would be at pos12, not pos13.

Let me trace through the action descriptions again:

"pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": Make agent p, situated at location l_p, push stone s from location l_from to goal location l_to, following direction d.

The preconditions include that "you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d" and "you can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d".

So, for the final push:
- Player is at pos11
- Stone is at pos12
- Goal is at pos13
- Direction from pos11 to pos12 should be the same as the direction from pos12 to pos13
- From the problem, we know "You may move from location pos11 to location pos12 following direction dirdown" and "You may move from location pos12 to location pos13 following direction dirdown"
- So the direction is dirdown

Hence, "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos11 pos12 pos13 dirdown" should work.

Let's finalize the plan:

1. "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos22 dirleft"
2. "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos22 pos12 dirleft"
3. "move player1 pos22 pos12 dirleft"
4. "move player1 pos12 pos11 dirup"
5. "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos11 pos12 pos13 dirdown"

This plan should move the stone from pos32 to pos13, achieving the goal. Let me double-check it.

After the first action (pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos22 dirleft), the player is at pos32 and the stone is at pos22. This is correct.

After the second action (pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos22 pos12 dirleft), the player is at pos22 and the stone is at pos12. This is correct.

After the third action (move player1 pos22 pos12 dirleft), the player is at pos12 and the stone is still at pos12. Wait, this doesn't make sense. The player can't be at the same location as the stone.

I made a mistake; the player can't move to a location that already has the stone. Let's correct the plan.

From pos22, the player needs to get to pos11 to be able to push the stone from pos12 to pos13. Let's trace a path from pos22 to pos11.

We know "You may move from location pos22 to location pos21 following direction dirup" and "You may move from location pos21 to location pos11 following direction dirleft".

So, the player can move from pos22 to pos21 using dirup, and then from pos21 to pos11 using dirleft.

Here's the corrected plan:

1. "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos22 dirleft"
2. "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos22 pos12 dirleft"
3. "move player1 pos22 pos21 dirup"
4. "move player1 pos21 pos11 dirleft"
5. "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos11 pos12 pos13 dirdown"

This plan should work. Let's check it once more:

After the first action, the player is at pos32 and the stone is at pos22. After the second action, the player is at pos22 and the stone is at pos12. After the third action, the player is at pos21 and the stone is still at pos12. After the fourth action, the player is at pos11 and the stone is still at pos12. Finally, after the fifth action, the player pushes the stone from pos12 to pos13, which is the goal.

So the final plan is:

1. "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos22 dirleft"
2. "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos22 pos12 dirleft"
3. "move player1 pos22 pos21 dirup"
4. "move player1 pos21 pos11 dirleft"
5. "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos11 pos12 pos13 dirdown"

However, on double-checking, I noticed a potential mistake. When I push the stone, the precondition is that the destination should be clear. But I need to make sure that both the player's location and the stone's location are clear before making the move.

Given the initial state, the player is at pos42, the stone is at pos32, and we also have "Location pos32 is clear". This seems contradictory. But let me revisit the effects of the actions to better understand how the state updates.

The effects of the "move" action are:
"(i) agent p is no longer at location l_from, (ii) location l_to is no longer clear, (iii) agent p is at location l_to, and (iv) location l_from is clear."

So when the player moves, their old position becomes clear.

The effects of the "push" actions are:
"(i) agent p is no longer at location l_p, (ii) stone s is no longer at location l_from, (iii) location l_to is no longer clear, (iv) agent p is at location l_from, (v) stone s is at location l_to, (vi) location l_p is clear, and (vi) stone s is at a goal/non-goal state."

So when a push happens, both the player's old position and the stone's old position become clear.

In the initial state, all locations are clear except where the player or stone is located. So, I think my original plan should work:

1. "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos22 dirleft": Push stone from pos32 to pos22.
2. "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos22 pos12 dirleft": Push stone from pos22 to pos12.
3. "move player1 pos22 pos21 dirup": Move player from pos22 to pos21.
4. "move player1 pos21 pos11 dirleft": Move player from pos21 to pos11.
5. "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos11 pos12 pos13 dirdown": Push stone from pos12 to pos13.

Actually I want to take a step back and make sure I've understood the preconditions of the actions. Let me read them again:

"pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": You may only perform this action if (i) agent p is at location l_p, (ii) stone s is at location l_from, (iii) location l_to is clear, (iv) you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d, (v) you can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d, and (vi) location l_to is a goal location.

And:

"pushtonongoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": You may only perform this action if (i) agent p is at location l_p, (ii) stone s is at location l_from, (iii) location l_to is clear, (iv) you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d, (v) you can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d, and (vi) location l_to is not a goal location.

Ok, so the player "pushes" the stone by moving in a specific direction, which aligns with my plan so far.

I re-read the initial state, and I noticed that it says both "stone1 is at location pos32" and "Location pos32 is clear". This seems contradictory. But I also noticed similar contradictions in the description. For instance, "player1 is at location pos42" and "Location pos42 is clear". 

Ok, I'm a bit confused because at the end of the description of the initial state, there are the two statements: "Location pos32 is clear" and "Location pos42 is clear". But earlier, it stated "player1 is at location pos42" and "stone1 is at location pos32". Perhaps the clear statements are superfluous or there's an error in the problem statement.

Let's assume that when it says a player or stone is at a location, then that location is not clear. And when it becomes clear, it means the player or stone is no longer there.

Given this interpretation, when the player moves via the "move" action, their old position becomes clear and their new position becomes not clear. Similarly, when pushing a stone, the stone's old position becomes clear and its new position becomes not clear.

Based on this interpretation, I'm more confident that my plan is correct:

1. "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos22 dirleft": Push stone from pos32 to pos22.
2. "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos22 pos12 dirleft": Push stone from pos22 to pos12.
3. "move player1 pos22 pos21 dirup": Move player from pos22 to pos21.
4. "move player1 pos21 pos11 dirleft": Move player from pos21 to pos11.
5. "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos11 pos12 pos13 dirdown": Push stone from pos12 to pos13.

However, I am still a bit hesitant about the "Location pos32 is clear" and "Location pos42 is clear" statements in the initial state. Let's double check whether these locations are clear or not:

In the initial state, we have:
"player1 is at location pos42"
"stone1 is at location pos32"

Later, we also have:
"Location pos32 is clear"
"Location pos42 is clear"

These seem contradictory. Let's see if there's any information in the problem statement that clarifies when a location is considered "clear".

I think the definition of "clear" is that a location doesn't have a stone or player on it. Given that the player is at pos42 and the stone is at pos32, those locations are not clear.

But it's confusing that the problem statement explicitly says "Location pos32 is clear" and "Location pos42 is clear", which contradicts the earlier statements.

Hmm, let me check the preconditions again. For the push actions, one of the preconditions is that "location l_to is clear", which means the destination of the push should not have a player or stone on it. This makes sense.

For the "move" action, there's a precondition that "location l_to is clear", which means the player can only move to a location without another player or stone.

Ah, I think I understand the issue. The problem statement may have been mistakenly provided with contradictory information.

The initial state should be:
"player1 is at location pos42"
"stone1 is at location pos32"
And these locations are NOT clear (because the player and stone occupy them).

All other positions (except pos42 and pos32) are clear.

With that understanding, let's revise the plan. Actually, my plan so far is still valid:

1. "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos22 dirleft": Push stone from pos32 to pos22.
2. "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos22 pos12 dirleft": Push stone from pos22 to pos12.
3. "move player1 pos22 pos21 dirup": Move player from pos22 to pos21.
4. "move player1 pos21 pos11 dirleft": Move player from pos21 to pos11.
5. "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos11 pos12 pos13 dirdown": Push stone from pos12 to pos13.

Now, let me double-check that each action satisfies the preconditions and results in the expected state.

Action 1: "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos22 dirleft"
Preconditions:
- Player1 is at pos42 (satisfied)
- Stone1 is at pos32 (satisfied)
- Pos22 is clear (according to the initial state, it should be clear, but I'm not 100% sure)
- Direction from pos42 to pos32 is dirleft (satisfied)
- Direction from pos32 to pos22 is dirleft (satisfied)
- Pos22 is not a goal location (satisfied)

Effects:
- Player1 is no longer at pos42, and is now at pos32
- Stone1 is no longer at pos32, and is now at pos22
- Pos42 is now clear
- Pos22 is no longer clear

Action 2: "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos22 pos12 dirleft"
Preconditions:
- Player1 is at pos32 (satisfied after action 1)
- Stone1 is at pos22 (satisfied after action 1)
- Pos12 is clear (according to the initial state, it should be clear)
- Direction from pos32 to pos22 is dirleft (satisfied)
- Direction from pos22 to pos12 is dirleft (satisfied)
- Pos12 is not a goal location (satisfied)

Effects:
- Player1 is no longer at pos32, and is now at pos22
- Stone1 is no longer at pos22, and is now at pos12
- Pos32 is now clear
- Pos12 is no longer clear

Action 3: "move player1 pos22 pos21 dirup"
Preconditions:
- Player1 is at pos22 (satisfied after action 2)
- Pos21 is clear (according to the initial state, it should be clear)
- Direction from pos22 to pos21 is dirup (satisfied)

Effects:
- Player1 is no longer at pos22, and is now at pos21
- Pos22 is now clear
- Pos21 is no longer clear

Action 4: "move player1 pos21 pos11 dirleft"
Preconditions:
- Player1 is at pos21 (satisfied after action 3)
- Pos11 is clear (according to the initial state, it should be clear)
- Direction from pos21 to pos11 is dirleft (satisfied)

Effects:
- Player1 is no longer at pos21, and is now at pos11
- Pos21 is now clear
- Pos11 is no longer clear

Action 5: "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos11 pos12 pos13 dirdown"
Preconditions:
- Player1 is at pos11 (satisfied after action 4)
- Stone1 is at pos12 (satisfied after action 2)
- Pos13 is clear (according to the initial state, it should be clear)
- Direction from pos11 to pos12 is dirdown (satisfied)
- Direction from pos12 to pos13 is dirdown (satisfied)
- Pos13 is a goal location (satisfied)

Effects:
- Player1 is no longer at pos11, and is now at pos12
- Stone1 is no longer at pos12, and is now at pos13
- Pos11 is now clear
- Pos13 is no longer clear
- Stone1 is at a goal location

So, the final state has Stone1 at a goal location, which is the desired outcome.

I believe the plan is correct, and here it is again:

1. "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos22 dirleft"
2. "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos22 pos12 dirleft"
3. "move player1 pos22 pos21 dirup"
4. "move player1 pos21 pos11 dirleft"
5. "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos11 pos12 pos13 dirdown"
