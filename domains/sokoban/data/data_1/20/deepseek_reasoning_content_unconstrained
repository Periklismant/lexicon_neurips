Okay, let's try to figure out how to solve this planning problem. So, the goal is to get stone1 to a goal location. From the initial state, I see that stone1 is at pos32. The only goal location mentioned is pos13. All other locations are not goals. So the target is to move stone1 from pos32 to pos13.

First, I need to check the possible paths. The agent starts at pos42. Let me map out the grid. The locations are arranged in a 5x5 grid, with pos11 to pos55. The agent is at pos42, and stone1 is at pos32. The goal is pos13.

Let me think about the movement. To push a stone, the agent needs to be adjacent to it. Since the stone is at pos32, the agent needs to get to a position where they can push it towards pos13. Looking at the movement directions, from pos42, the agent can move up to pos41, left to pos32 (but pos32 has the stone, which is clear, so maybe they can move there?), wait, no. The initial state says "Location pos32 is clear" but the stone is at pos32. Wait, that's conflicting. Wait, no: the initial state lists "stone1 is at location pos32" and "Location pos32 is clear". But if the stone is there, the location shouldn't be clear. Wait, maybe that's a mistake in the problem statement. Wait, let me check again.

Looking at the original state:

"stone1 is at location pos32"

"Location pos32 is clear"

Hmm, that seems contradictory. Because if a stone is at pos32, then pos32 shouldn't be clear. But according to the problem's initial state, pos32 is clear. That must be an error. Or maybe "clear" refers to the presence of the agent? Wait, the problem description says "Each position on the grid may contain either the agent, a stone or be empty." So a location is clear if it doesn't have the agent or a stone. But in the initial state, stone1 is at pos32, so pos32 should not be clear. But according to the given initial state, "Location pos32 is clear". That's a problem. Maybe it's a typo? Or maybe "clear" refers to something else. Wait, perhaps "clear" is a separate property, but that doesn't make sense. Hmm. Maybe I need to check the problem again.

Wait, the original state includes:

"Location pos32 is clear"

But also:

"stone1 is at location pos32"

So that's conflicting. Unless "clear" means that there's no agent there. Because the agent is at pos42. So maybe "clear" in this context means that there's no agent in that location. Because a stone can be present, but if there's no agent, the location is considered clear. That would make sense. So the "clear" status is about the agent, not the stone. So when an action says "location l_to is clear", it means that there's no agent or stone there. Wait, but according to the action preconditions, for example, the "move" action requires that location l_to is clear. If the stone is at pos32 and the agent is moving to pos32, then pos32 isn't clear, so the move can't happen. But according to the initial state, pos32 is clear, even with the stone there. So perhaps "clear" refers to the agent's presence. Wait, no. Let me recheck the problem's initial state.

The problem's initial state says:

"Location pos32 is clear" but stone1 is there. So perhaps "clear" here is a mistake. But maybe in the problem's definition, a location is clear if there's no agent, regardless of stones. So the presence of a stone doesn't affect the clearness. But that seems odd. Because when pushing a stone, you need to move into the stone's location, which would require that location to be clear. But if the stone is there, then that location is not clear. Hmm, this is confusing.

Wait, the problem's action preconditions:

For "move p l_from l_to d", the preconditions are (i) agent p is at l_from, (ii) l_to is clear, (iii) can get from l_from to l_to via d.

So if "l_to is clear" means that there's no agent or stone there, then moving into a location with a stone is impossible. But in the initial state, pos32 has stone1, so pos32 is not clear, so the agent can't move there. But according to the initial state, pos32 is clear. So maybe there's a mistake in the problem's initial state. Or perhaps "clear" refers only to the agent's presence. That is, a location is clear if there's no agent there. Stones don't block the agent's movement. That might make sense, but that's a bit counterintuitive. Alternatively, maybe the problem has a typo and pos32 is not supposed to be clear. But as per the given information, I have to work with the problem as stated.

Alternatively, maybe "clear" in the problem's terms refers to whether the agent is present, not stones. So a stone's presence doesn't affect whether a location is clear. That's possible. So when moving, the agent can move to a location with a stone, as long as there's no agent there. But when pushing a stone, the stone's location is l_from, which must have the stone. Then, pushing requires that the agent is adjacent to the stone. Wait, but according to the actions' preconditions:

For "pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d", the agent is at l_p, stone s is at l_from. The direction allows moving from l_p to l_from (so adjacent in direction d), and then from l_from to l_to (so the stone moves in direction d). So for example, if the agent is north of the stone, pushing it south would require moving the agent south into the stone's location (l_from) and then the stone moves south to l_to. But according to the move action, the agent can't move into a location that's not clear. But if the stone is considered to not block the movement, then maybe the agent can move into the stone's location. But that contradicts the move action's preconditions.

This is getting complicated. Let's try to parse the problem's definitions again.

In the problem's action preconditions:

- "move p l_from l_to d": (ii) location l_to is clear. So if l_to has a stone, then it's not clear, so the move is not allowed. Therefore, the agent can't move into a location with a stone. Therefore, the initial state's "Location pos32 is clear" must be a mistake because stone1 is at pos32. Therefore, there's a conflict in the problem statement.

Alternatively, perhaps "clear" in the problem's initial state refers to something else, like not having obstacles. But the problem says each position may contain the agent, a stone, or be empty. So a location is clear if it's empty (no agent, no stone). But in that case, pos32 has a stone, so it's not clear. But the problem says it is. Therefore, this must be an error in the problem statement. But since I have to work with the given information, perhaps I should proceed under the assumption that pos32 is clear (i.e., no agent is there, even though there's a stone). Therefore, moving into pos32 would be allowed because it's considered clear (despite the stone). But that's confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the initial state's "Location pos32 is clear" is a mistake, and pos32 is not clear. But how can I resolve this?

Alternatively, perhaps "clear" refers to the presence of the agent only. So a location is clear if there's no agent there. Stones don't affect clearness. So in the initial state, pos32 has a stone but no agent, so it's clear. That might make sense. Then, when moving, the agent can move to a location even if there's a stone there, as long as there's no agent. But then, when the agent moves into a location with a stone, what happens? Because the move action's effect is that the agent is now at l_to, and l_from is clear. But if there's a stone at l_to, the move action's effect would have the agent there, but the stone is still there. That would mean that a location can have both agent and stone, which contradicts the problem's statement that each position may contain either agent, a stone, or be empty. So that's impossible. Therefore, the initial state must have a mistake. But since I can't change the problem, perhaps I have to proceed under the assumption that the initial state is correct as given. But this is confusing.

Alternatively, maybe the problem's initial state says "Location pos32 is clear" but the stone is there, which is a mistake. But since I have to work with the problem as given, maybe I need to proceed. Let's proceed with the given information.

So, the agent is at pos42. Stone1 is at pos32. The goal is to get stone1 to pos13 (the only goal location). So how to do that?

First, the agent needs to get to a position where they can push the stone towards the goal. Let's look at the possible moves.

The agent is at pos42. From the movement connections, pos42 can move to pos32 (left), pos52 (right), pos41 (up), or pos43 (down). But according to the problem's allowed movements:

Looking at the "You may move from..." statements:

From pos42, allowed moves are:

"You may move from location pos42 to location pos32 following direction dirleft"

"You may move from location pos42 to location pos52 following direction dirright"

"You may move from location pos42 to location pos41 following direction dirup"

"You may move from location pos42 to location pos43 following direction dirdown"

So the agent can move left to pos32 (dirleft), right to pos52, up to pos41, or down to pos43.

But pos32 has the stone. So if the agent moves to pos32 (from pos42 via dirleft), then according to the move action's preconditions, the l_to (pos32) must be clear. But in the initial state, pos32 is clear. Wait, according to the problem's original state, pos32 is clear, but the stone is there. So if a stone is present, then pos32 isn't clear. Therefore, this must be a mistake. But if we proceed as per the problem's given state, where pos32 is clear (even with stone1 there), then the agent can move into pos32.

Wait, but according to the problem's initial state, "Location pos32 is clear" even though stone1 is there. So according to the problem's definition, a location is clear if there's no agent, regardless of stones. That must be the case here. So "clear" refers to the agent's presence, not the stone's. Therefore, moving to pos32 is allowed because it's clear (no agent there), even though there's a stone. But when the agent moves into pos32, according to the move action's effects, the agent is now at pos32, and pos32 is no longer clear. But the stone is still there. But according to the problem's description, each position can contain either the agent, a stone, or be empty. So having both agent and stone in the same position is impossible. Therefore, this suggests that the problem's initial state is incorrect, but since we have to work with it, perhaps we need to proceed under the assumption that the stone and agent can coexist. But that's not possible per the problem's description.

Alternatively, maybe the problem's initial state is correct, and the "clear" property refers to the presence of the agent only. So a location with a stone is considered clear if there's no agent. But when the agent moves there, the location becomes occupied by the agent, and the stone is still there. But this contradicts the problem's statement that each position can contain either the agent, a stone, or be empty.

This is a critical issue. How to resolve this? Without understanding the problem's semantics correctly, it's impossible to proceed. Let's re-examine the problem's description:

Each position on the grid may contain either the agent, a stone or be empty. So each location can have at most one of those: agent, stone, or empty. Therefore, a location with a stone is not clear (since it's occupied by the stone), and a location with the agent is not clear (since occupied by the agent). So "clear" means empty. Therefore, in the initial state, pos32 is clear (empty) but the stone is there. That's a contradiction. Therefore, the initial state must have a mistake. But since this is a problem given to solve, perhaps I should proceed with the assumption that the initial state is correct, and that the stone is at pos32, which is not clear. But in the problem's initial state, pos32 is listed as clear. So there's a conflict. Therefore, perhaps there's a typo in the problem's initial state. For example, maybe the stone is at pos33, and pos32 is clear. But according to the problem's given initial state, stone1 is at pos32, and pos32 is clear. Therefore, this is an inconsistency.

Alternatively, perhaps "clear" in the problem's context refers to the agent's presence. So a location is clear if there's no agent, regardless of stones. So the presence of a stone doesn't affect the clearness. Therefore, the agent can move to a location with a stone if it's clear (i.e., no agent is there). But when the agent moves there, the stone is still present. But according to the problem's initial description, each position can only have one of agent, stone, or empty. Therefore, this is impossible. Therefore, the problem's initial state must have an error. But since I can't change the problem, I have to work with it. Maybe the correct initial state is that pos32 is not clear (since the stone is there), but the problem states it is. Therefore, perhaps the problem's initial state is incorrect, but I have to proceed.

Alternatively, maybe the problem's initial state lists "Location pos32 is clear" but that's a mistake. So the correct initial state is that pos32 is not clear. But how can I know? This is a problem, but since I have to proceed, perhaps I should assume that the problem is correct, and that "clear" refers to the absence of the agent. So a location is clear if there's no agent, even if there's a stone. Therefore, pos32 is clear (no agent), and the stone is there. So the agent can move into pos32, which would then make it not clear (agent is there), and the stone is still there. But this contradicts the problem's statement that each position can contain either the agent, a stone, or be empty. Therefore, this is impossible. Therefore, the problem's initial state must have an error. 

Given the confusion, perhaps the best approach is to proceed under the assumption that there's a typo in the problem's initial state. For example, perhaps the stone is at pos33, and pos32 is clear. But according to the problem, stone1 is at pos32, and pos32 is clear. Alternatively, maybe the stone is at pos32, but pos32 is not clear (so the problem's initial state is wrong). But without knowing, it's hard to proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem's "clear" refers to the presence of the agent. So a location is clear if the agent is not there, regardless of stones. So moving to a location with a stone is allowed, but when the agent moves there, the stone is pushed? No, that's part of the push actions, not the move actions. Therefore, perhaps the move action can't be used to move into a location with a stone. Therefore, the initial state must have a mistake where pos32 is clear but has a stone. But given that, perhaps the problem's intended initial state is that the stone is at pos32, which is not clear. But the given initial state says pos32 is clear. So this is a problem.

This is a significant roadblock. Without knowing the correct initial state, it's hard to proceed. But maybe I can proceed under the assumption that the problem's initial state is correct, and "clear" refers to the absence of the agent. So the stone's presence doesn't affect clearness. Therefore, pos32 is clear (no agent) even though there's a stone there. So the agent can move into pos32, which would then make pos32 occupied by the agent (and the stone is still there). But this is impossible per the problem's description, which states each location can have either the agent, a stone, or be empty. Therefore, this is a contradiction. Therefore, the only way this makes sense is if the initial state has a mistake. So perhaps the stone is actually at pos33, and pos32 is clear. But according to the problem, the stone is at pos32.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem's initial state has a typo, and pos32 is not clear. So let's assume that pos32 is not clear, but the problem says it is. Therefore, the agent can't move into pos32. So the agent must find another way to push the stone.

Wait, the agent is at pos42. The stone is at pos32. The agent needs to push the stone towards pos13. So how to get to a position adjacent to the stone. From pos32, the agent can be at pos31, pos22, pos33, or pos42. Since pos42 is where the agent starts. So the agent is already at pos42, which is south of pos32. So if the agent can push the stone north (from pos32 to pos22), but pos22 is not a goal. But the goal is pos13. So perhaps the agent needs to push the stone up from pos32 to pos22, then to pos13.

Wait, but the only goal is pos13. So the stone must end up there. Let's see the movement directions.

From pos32, pushing the stone north (dirup) would take it to pos22. Then from pos22, pushing north (dirup) to pos12, then to pos13. But pos13 is a goal. Alternatively, perhaps the agent can move around to push the stone.

But let's think step by step.

Initial positions:

Agent at pos42.

Stone1 at pos32.

Goal is to have stone1 at pos13, which is a goal location.

Possible paths from pos32 to pos13:

pos32 -> pos22 -> pos12 -> pos13.

Or pos32 -> pos33 -> pos34 -> ... but that's moving east, but pos13 is northwest from pos32.

So the shortest path is north to pos22, then north to pos12, then east to pos13. But pos13 is a goal.

But how to push the stone along that path.

To push the stone north from pos32 to pos22, the agent needs to be south of the stone (pos32's south is pos42). So the agent is at pos42, which is south of pos32. To push the stone north, the agent would need to be at pos32's south (which is pos42) and push north. So the direction would be dirdown (since pushing from south to north requires moving into the stone's position, which is north of the agent's position. Wait, no. The directions are a bit confusing.

Wait, the direction for pushing: the agent is at l_p, which is adjacent to l_from (stone's current position), and the stone moves from l_from to l_to in direction d. For example, if the agent is south of the stone (at pos42), then l_p is pos42, l_from is pos32. To push the stone north (dirup), the stone would move to pos22. Wait, no. Because the direction d is the direction from l_p to l_from. So if the agent is at pos42 (south of the stone at pos32), then to push the stone north, the direction from the agent's position (pos42) to the stone's position (pos32) is dirup. Then, the direction from the stone's position (pos32) to the target location (pos22) would also be dirup. So the action would be "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos22 dirup". Because pos22 is not a goal (as per the initial state), so we use pushtonongoal. Then, once the stone is at pos22, we can push it to pos12 (again north), using dirup again, then to pos13 (east). But pos12 to pos13 is east, so the direction would be dirdown? Wait, no. The directions are based on the grid's movement. Let's clarify the directions.

Looking at the movement connections:

For example, from pos12, you can move to pos22 (dirdown), pos11 (dirup), pos13 (dirdown). Wait, no. Wait, the allowed movements are given as:

"You may move from location pos12 to location pos22 following direction dirright"

Wait, dirright? So direction names might correspond to the direction you face when moving. For example, moving from pos12 to pos22 is dirright? That seems odd. Wait, perhaps the directions are named based on the direction of movement. For example, dirright means moving to the east, dirleft to the west, dirup to the north, dirdown to the south.

Wait, looking at the movement from pos11 to pos21 is dirright. pos21 is to the east of pos11, so dirright is east. pos11 to pos12 is dirdown. pos12 is south of pos11, so dirdown is south. So directions are:

dirright: east

dirleft: west

dirup: north

dirdown: south

Therefore, the directions correspond to cardinal directions. So when moving east, it's dirright, etc.

So, if the agent is at pos42 (south of pos32), to push the stone north (from pos32 to pos22), the agent would need to push in the dirup direction.

So the action would be pushtonongoal (since pos22 is not a goal) with direction dirup.

But first, the agent must be in a position to push. The agent is at pos42. The stone is at pos32. To push the stone north, the agent must be south of the stone (which they are). So the action is pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos22 dirup.

But wait, the preconditions for pushtonongoal are:

(i) agent p is at l_p (pos42)

(ii) stone s is at l_from (pos32)

(iii) l_to (pos22) is clear

(iv) can move from l_p to l_from via d (dirup) — yes, since pos42 to pos32 is dirup.

(v) can move from l_from to l_to via d (dirup) — pos32 to pos22 is dirup.

(vi) l_to is not a goal. pos22 is not a goal, so yes.

So all preconditions are met.

After this action, the agent moves from pos42 to pos32, and the stone moves from pos32 to pos22. Then, pos42 becomes clear.

But pos22 is clear in the initial state? Let me check. The initial state says "Location pos22 is clear". So yes. So after this action, pos22 will have the stone, and the agent is at pos32. Then, the agent is at pos32, and the stone is at pos22.

Next, the agent needs to push the stone from pos22 to pos12. To do that, the agent must be south of pos22, i.e., pos32. So the agent is already at pos32. So the next action is pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos22 pos12 dirup.

Check preconditions:

Agent is at pos32 (l_p = pos32)

Stone is at pos22 (l_from = pos22). Wait, no, after the first action, the stone is at pos22, but the agent is at pos32. So the next action would be pushing from pos22 to pos12. But the agent is at pos32, which is south of pos22. So the direction from l_p (pos32) to l_from (pos22) is dirup. From l_from (pos22) to l_to (pos12) is dirup. pos12 is not a goal. So the action is pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos22 pos12 dirup.

Check preconditions:

pos32 is the agent's current location (yes).

stone is at pos22 (yes).

pos12 is clear (initial state says pos12 is clear, but after the first action, the stone is at pos22, so pos12 is still clear).

Can move from pos32 to pos22 via dirup? Yes, as per the movement list: "You may move from location pos32 to location pos22 following direction dirup".

Can move from pos22 to pos12 via dirup? Yes: "You may move from location pos22 to location pos12 following direction dirup".

pos12 is not a goal (correct).

So this action is valid.

After this, the agent moves to pos22, and the stone moves to pos12.

Now, the agent is at pos22, stone is at pos12. Next, push the stone to pos13. pos13 is a goal, so use pushtogoal.

To push from pos12 to pos13, the agent must be west of pos12 (dirright to pos12), east (dirleft), north (dirdown?), or south (dirup?). Let's see the directions.

pos12 to pos13 is east? Looking at the movement list: "You may move from location pos12 to location pos13 following direction dirdown". Wait, pos12 to pos13 is dirdown. So the direction is dirdown (south). So to push the stone from pos12 to pos13 (south), the agent must be north of pos12. Because the direction from the agent's position to the stone's position (pos12) is dirdown. So the agent must be at pos12's north, which is pos11 or pos12's north neighbor. Wait, looking at the grid:

pos11 is north of pos12. So if the agent is at pos11, they can push the stone south to pos13. But currently, the agent is at pos22. So the agent needs to move from pos22 to pos12, then to pos11.

Wait, after the second action, the agent is at pos22. The stone is at pos12. The agent is at pos22. To push the stone from pos12 to pos13 (south), the agent needs to be north of pos12. So the agent must move to pos12's north, which is pos11 or pos12's north neighbor. Wait, according to the movement list:

From pos12, you can move to pos22 (dirright), pos11 (dirup), pos13 (dirdown). So pos12's north neighbor is pos11. So to push the stone south to pos13, the agent must be at pos12's north (pos11), and push south (dirdown). So the action would be pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos11 pos12 pos13 dirdown.

But the agent is currently at pos22. So they need to move from pos22 to pos12, then to pos11.

But the stone is at pos12. So moving to pos12 would require that pos12 is clear. But pos12 has the stone. So the agent can't move there. Therefore, the agent can't move to pos12. So how to get to pos11.

Alternative route: from pos22, the agent can move to pos12's east neighbor, which is pos22's east. Wait, pos22's east is pos32. So pos22's possible movements:

"You may move from location pos22 to location pos12 following direction dirleft"

"You may move from location pos22 to location pos32 following direction dirright"

"You may move from location pos22 to location pos21 following direction dirup"

"You may move from location pos22 to location pos23 following direction dirdown"

So the agent can move from pos22 to pos12 via dirleft. But pos12 has the stone, so pos12 is not clear (since the stone is there). Therefore, the agent can't move to pos12. So they need to find another path.

Wait, perhaps the agent can move from pos22 to pos21 (dirup), then pos21 to pos11 (dirleft), then pos11 to pos12 (dirdown). But pos12 has the stone, so pos12 is not clear. So the agent can't move into pos12. Therefore, how to get to pos11.

Wait, the agent is at pos22. From pos22, they can move to pos21 (dirup), then from pos21 to pos11 (dirleft). So move to pos21, then to pos11. Then, the agent is at pos11. From there, they can push the stone at pos12 south to pos13 (dirdown). So the action would be pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos11 pos12 pos13 dirdown.

Let's see:

Preconditions for pushtogoal:

(i) agent is at pos11 (l_p)

(ii) stone1 is at pos12 (l_from)

(iii) pos13 (l_to) is clear. Initially, pos13 is clear, but after previous steps, it's still clear.

(iv) can move from pos11 to pos12 via dirdown. Yes: "You may move from location pos11 to location pos12 following direction dirdown".

(v) can move from pos12 to pos13 via dirdown. Yes: "You may move from location pos12 to location pos13 following direction dirdown".

(vi) pos13 is a goal location. Yes.

So all preconditions are met.

So the steps would be:

1. Agent moves from pos42 to pos32 (but wait, pos32 has the stone, so moving there would require it to be clear. But according to initial state, pos32 is clear. But if the stone is there, it's not clear. Therefore, this is impossible. So perhaps my previous assumption is wrong. Therefore, the initial move must be different.

Wait, this brings us back to the initial problem. If the agent is at pos42, and wants to push the stone at pos32 north to pos22, the agent needs to be at pos42 (south of pos32), and use the pushtonongoal action. So the first action is pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos22 dirup.

But for this action, the preconditions are:

- agent is at pos42 (yes)

- stone is at pos32 (yes)

- pos22 is clear (yes, according to initial state)

- can move from pos42 to pos32 via dirup (yes: "You may move from location pos42 to location pos32 following direction dirup")

- can move from pos32 to pos22 via dirup (yes: "You may move from location pos32 to location pos22 following direction dirup")

- pos22 is not a goal (yes)

So this action is valid.

After this action:

- agent moves to pos32

- stone moves to pos22

- pos42 becomes clear

Now, agent is at pos32, stone at pos22.

Next, push the stone from pos22 to pos12.

Agent is at pos32, which is south of pos22. So again, use pushtonongoal with dirup.

Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos22 pos12 dirup.

Preconditions:

- agent at pos32 (yes)

- stone at pos22 (yes)

- pos12 is clear (yes)

- can move from pos32 to pos22 via dirup (yes: "You may move from location pos32 to location pos22 following direction dirup")

- can move from pos22 to pos12 via dirup (yes: "You may move from location pos22 to location pos12 following direction dirup")

- pos12 is not a goal (yes)

So this action is valid.

After this:

- agent moves to pos22

- stone moves to pos12

Now, agent is at pos22, stone at pos12.

Next, push the stone to pos13, which is a goal.

Agent needs to be north of pos12 to push it south (dirdown). So agent must be at pos11.

So the agent needs to move from pos22 to pos11.

Path from pos22 to pos11:

From pos22, can move to pos21 (dirup), then pos21 to pos11 (dirleft).

Action 3: move player1 pos22 pos21 dirup.

Preconditions:

- agent is at pos22 (yes)

- pos21 is clear (initial state says pos21 is clear, and after previous actions, no one has moved there. So yes.)

- can move from pos22 to pos21 via dirup (yes)

After this, agent is at pos21.

Action 4: move player1 pos21 pos11 dirleft.

Preconditions:

- agent at pos21 (yes)

- pos11 is clear (initial state says pos11 is clear)

- can move from pos21 to pos11 via dirleft (yes: "You may move from location pos21 to location pos11 following direction dirleft")

After this, agent is at pos11.

Now, push the stone from pos12 to pos13.

Action 5: pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos11 pos12 pos13 dirdown.

Preconditions:

- agent at pos11 (yes)

- stone at pos12 (yes)

- pos13 is clear (yes)

- can move from pos11 to pos12 via dirdown (yes)

- can move from pos12 to pos13 via dirdown (yes)

- pos13 is a goal (yes)

So this action is valid.

After this, stone1 is at pos13 (goal), and agent is at pos12.

So the plan would be:

```
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos22 dirup
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos22 pos12 dirup
move player1 pos22 pos21 dirup
move player1 pos21 pos11 dirleft
pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos11 pos12 pos13 dirdown
```

But wait, after the second action (pushtonongoal from pos32 to pos22), the agent is at pos22. So after the second action, agent is at pos22. Then, action 3 is moving from pos22 to pos21 via dirup. Then to pos11 via dirleft, then pushtogoal.

But let's count the steps:

1. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos22 dirup

2. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos22 pos12 dirup

Wait, after the first action, the agent is at pos32 (l_from). So after first action, agent is at pos32. Then, the second action's l_p is pos32. Because after the first action, the agent is at pos32.

Wait, the effect of pushtonongoal is:

- agent is no longer at l_p (pos42)

- stone is no longer at l_from (pos32)

- l_to (pos22) is no longer clear

- agent is at l_from (pos32)

- stone is at l_to (pos22)

So after the first action, agent is at pos32.

Then, the second action is pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos22 pos12 dirup.

So agent is at pos32 (l_p), stone is at pos22 (l_from).

After this action, the agent moves to pos22 (l_from), and the stone to pos12 (l_to).

So after the second action, agent is at pos22.

Then, the agent can move from pos22 to pos21 (dirup), then to pos11 (dirleft).

Then, push the stone to pos13.

So the plan steps are:

1. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos22 dirup

2. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos22 pos12 dirup

3. move player1 pos22 pos21 dirup

4. move player1 pos21 pos11 dirleft

5. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos11 pos12 pos13 dirdown

This is 5 actions. But is this the shortest possible?

Is there a way to do it in fewer steps?

Alternative approach: After pushing the stone to pos22, then to pos12, then the agent can move east to pos23, but that doesn't help. Alternatively, after pushing the stone to pos12, the agent is at pos22. Can the agent move to pos12's west (pos11) via some path? But pos12 has the stone, so moving there is impossible. So the agent needs to go around.

Wait, after the second action, agent is at pos22, stone is at pos12. The agent needs to get to pos11 to push the stone south. So moving from pos22 to pos21 (dirup), then pos21 to pos11 (dirleft). Then push. That's two move actions plus the push. So steps 3,4,5 are move, move, push. That's three steps.

Alternatively, can the agent find a shorter path from pos22 to pos11? For example, from pos22, can they move directly to pos12 via dirleft, but pos12 is occupied by the stone, so that's not possible. Therefore, the agent has to take the two moves.

So the total steps are 5. Is there a way to reduce this?

What if after pushing the stone to pos12, the agent moves directly from pos22 to pos12 via dirleft, but pos12 is occupied by the stone, so that's not allowed. So no.

Alternatively, after the second action (agent at pos22), can the agent move to pos23, then pos24, etc., but that would take more steps.

So the plan with 5 actions seems optimal.

Let me check if all preconditions are met for each action.

Action 1: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos22 dirup.

- agent at pos42: yes.

- stone at pos32: yes.

- pos22 clear: yes.

- can move from pos42 to pos32 via dirup: yes.

- can move from pos32 to pos22 via dirup: yes.

- pos22 is not a goal: yes.

Action 2: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos22 pos12 dirup.

- agent at pos32: yes (after action 1).

- stone at pos22: yes.

- pos12 clear: yes.

- can move from pos32 to pos22 via dirup: yes.

- can move from pos22 to pos12 via dirup: yes.

- pos12 is not a goal: yes.

Action 3: move player1 pos22 pos21 dirup.

- agent at pos22: yes (after action 2).

- pos21 clear: yes.

- can move from pos22 to pos21 via dirup: yes.

Action 4: move player1 pos21 pos11 dirleft.

- agent at pos21: yes.

- pos11 clear: yes.

- can move from pos21 to pos11 via dirleft: yes.

Action 5: pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos11 pos12 pos13 dirdown.

- agent at pos11: yes.

- stone at pos12: yes.

- pos13 clear: yes.

- can move from pos11 to pos12 via dirdown: yes.

- can move from pos12 to pos13 via dirdown: yes.

- pos13 is goal: yes.

All steps are valid. Therefore, this plan should work. The length is 5 actions. Is there a shorter plan?

Alternative approach: After the first push to pos22, can the agent move east to pos32, then north to pos22 again? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe there's a more direct route.

Wait, after the first two pushes, the stone is at pos12, and the agent is at pos22. The agent needs to get to pos11. The fastest way is two moves (pos22 to pos21 to pos11). That's two moves. So steps 3 and 4 are necessary.

Then step 5 is the push. Total 5 steps. 

Is there a way to combine these steps? For example, can the agent push the stone from pos12 to pos13 without moving to pos11? To push south from pos12 to pos13, the agent needs to be north of pos12 (pos11). So no. Therefore, steps 3-5 are necessary.

So the plan is 5 actions. I don't see a shorter way. Therefore, this is the optimal plan.
