**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Move from pos44 to pos34 (dirleft):** The agent moves left from pos44 to pos34.
2. **Move from pos34 to pos33 (dirup):** The agent moves up to pos33.
3. **Move from pos33 to pos32 (dirup):** The agent moves up to pos32.
4. **Move from pos32 to pos31 (dirup):** The agent moves up to pos31.
5. **Move from pos31 to pos21 (dirleft):** The agent moves left to pos21, positioning north of the stone.
6. **Push stone from pos22 to pos23 (dirdown):** The agent at pos21 pushes the stone south to pos23 (non-goal).
7. **Move from pos22 to pos32 (dirright):** After pushing, the agent moves east to pos32.
8. **Move from pos32 to pos33 (dirdown):** The agent moves down to pos33 (goal location).
9. **Push stone from pos23 to pos33 (dirleft):** The agent at pos33 pushes the stone west to pos33 (goal), using the "pushtogoal" action since pos33 is a goal. 

This sequence ensures the stone reaches the goal pos33 with the minimum steps.
