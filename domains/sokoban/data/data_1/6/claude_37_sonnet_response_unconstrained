Let's break down the problem:

1. We have a 2D square grid (5x5 based on the positions given).
2. The grid contains an agent (player1), a stone (stone1), and empty spaces.
3. Some positions are marked as goal positions, specifically only pos51 in this case.
4. We need to move the stone (stone1) to a goal position.

Let's analyze the initial state:
- player1 is at position pos44
- stone1 is at position pos43
- pos51 is the only goal position

We can visualize the grid (with 1 being the first coordinate and 5 being the last):

```
   1  2  3  4  5
1  .  .  .  .  .
2  .  .  .  .  .
3  .  .  .  .  .
4  .  .  S  P  .
5  G  .  .  .  .
```

Where P is the player, S is the stone, and G is the goal position.

The task is to move the stone to the goal position (pos51). To do this, the player needs to push the stone there.

Let's think about how to proceed:

1. The player is at pos44 and the stone is at pos43.
2. To push the stone, the player needs to be on the side opposite to the direction they want to push the stone.
3. Since we want to move the stone to pos51, we need to push it left and then down.

Let's plan a path:

1. First, the player needs to move to a position that allows them to push the stone. The player is at pos44, and the stone is at pos43. To push the stone left, the player needs to move to pos43's right side, but the player is already at pos44, which is the right of pos43.
2. To push the stone left from pos43 to pos33, the player would execute a "pushtonongoal" action (since pos33 is not a goal position).
3. From pos33, we would push the stone left to pos23, then to pos13, and so on, following a path to the goal.

Actually, we need to revise the initial visualization. Let's see if the naming convention is based on (row, column):

```
   1  2  3  4  5
1 p11 p12 p13 p14 p15
2 p21 p22 p23 p24 p25
3 p31 p32 p33 p34 p35
4 p41 p42 p43 p44 p45
5 p51 p52 p53 p54 p55
```

So, the player is at pos44 (4th row, 4th column), and the stone is at pos43 (4th row, 3rd column). The goal is at pos51 (5th row, 1st column).

Alright, with this in mind, let's plan a path again:

1. The player needs to move to a position that allows them to push the stone down. 
2. To push the stone down from pos43 to pos53, the player needs to be at pos33 (above the stone).
3. From pos53, we can push the stone left to pos52, and then to the goal at pos51.

Let's trace through the steps:

1. Player moves from pos44 to pos34 (moving left) using the "move" action.
2. Player moves from pos34 to pos33 (moving left) using the "move" action.
3. Player moves from pos33 to pos43 (moving down) and pushes the stone to pos53 using the "pushtonongoal" action.
4. Player moves from pos43 to pos53 (moving down) and pushes the stone to pos52 using the "pushtonongoal" action.
5. Player moves from pos53 to pos52 (moving left) and pushes the stone to pos51 using the "pushtogoal" action.

Does this plan look correct? Let me check the actions and preconditions again.

For the "move" action, the prerequisites are:
- Agent p is at location l_from.
- Location l_to is clear.
- You can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d.

For the "pushtonongoal" and "pushtogoal" actions, the prerequisites are:
- Agent p is at location l_p.
- Stone s is at location l_from.
- Location l_to is clear.
- You can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d.
- You can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d.
- Location l_to is not a goal location (for "pushtonongoal") or is a goal location (for "pushtogoal").

Looking at the prerequisites, I'm wondering if my plan makes sense, especially for the pushing part, so let me look more at the action definitions.

The "move" action moves the agent from one location to another.
The "pushtonongoal" and "pushtogoal" actions allow the agent to push a stone from one location to another, but they require the agent to be adjacent to the stone in the opposite direction of the push.

Let's revisit the problem and reformulate the plan:

Given the initial state:
- player1 is at position pos44
- stone1 is at position pos43
- pos51 is the only goal position

The player needs to push the stone to the goal. The stone is at pos43, and the goal is at pos51. To move the stone, the player needs to be on the side opposite to the desired direction of movement.

A possible plan would be:

1. Player moves from pos44 to pos34 (moving left) using the "move" action.
2. Player moves from pos34 to pos33 (moving left) using the "move" action.
3. Now the player is above the stone (which is at pos43). To push it down, the player would be at pos33 and the stone would move from pos43 to pos53.

Let me try to formulate this with the given action format:

1. move player1 pos44 pos34 dirleft
2. move player1 pos34 pos33 dirleft
3. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos43 pos53 dirdown
4. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos53 pos52 dirleft
5. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos53 pos52 pos51 dirleft

However there are some problems here - the pushtogoal and pushtonongoal actions as described have three key locations:

1. l_p: The position of the agent before the action.
2. l_from: The position of the stone before the action.
3. l_to: The position of the stone after the action.

It is also stated that the effect includes "agent p is at location l_from" after the action, which means that after pushing the stone, the agent will be at the position where the stone was originally.

Let's revisit the plan with this understanding:

1. Player moves from pos44 to pos34 (moving left) using the "move" action.
2. Player moves from pos34 to pos33 (moving left) using the "move" action.
3. Player pushes the stone from pos43 to pos53, ending up at pos43.
4. Player moves from pos43 to pos53 (moving down) using the "move" action.
5. Player pushes the stone from pos53 to pos52, ending up at pos53.
6. Player pushes the stone from pos52 to pos51, ending up at pos52.

Translated to action format:

1. move player1 pos44 pos34 dirleft
2. move player1 pos34 pos33 dirleft
3. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos43 pos53 dirdown
4. move player1 pos43 pos53 dirdown
5. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos53 pos53 pos52 dirleft
6. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos52 pos52 pos51 dirleft

Wait a moment. In the pushtonongoal and pushtogoal actions, it says "you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d, (v) you can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d." This means that the direction for getting from the agent's position to the stone's position should be the same as the direction for getting from the stone's position to the target position. It seems like these actions expect a straight line for the agent, stone, and target.

Let me revisit the plan:

1. Player moves from pos44 to pos34 (moving left) using the "move" action.
2. Player moves from pos34 to pos33 (moving left) using the "move" action.
3. Player pushes the stone from pos43 to pos53 in the "dirdown" direction, ending up at pos43.

This third action seems problematic. If the player is at pos33 and the stone is at pos43, the direction from pos33 to pos43 is "dirdown". But we're also pushing the stone from pos43 to pos53 in the "dirdown" direction. This seems correct, but I just want to be sure. 

Let's read the action description again:
"pushtonongoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": You may only perform this action if (i) agent p is at location l_p, (ii) stone s is at location l_from, (iii) location l_to is clear, (iv) you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d, (v) you can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d, and (vi) location l_to is not a goal location.

In our case, the third action becomes:
"pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos43 pos53 dirdown": 
- player1 is at pos33
- stone1 is at pos43
- pos53 is clear
- We can get from pos33 to pos43 following the direction dirdown
- We can get from pos43 to pos53 following the direction dirdown
- pos53 is not a goal location

This action seems valid. So our plan should proceed:

1. move player1 pos44 pos34 dirleft
2. move player1 pos34 pos33 dirleft
3. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos43 pos53 dirdown
4. move player1 pos43 pos53 dirdown
5. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos53 pos53 pos52 dirleft

Actually I realize I made a mistake in step 5. If player is at pos53 and the stone is also at pos53, then we're double counting. Let me correct this.

Wait, after the third action the player would be at pos43 and the stone would be at pos53. So the 4th action would be the player moving from pos43 to pos53. But pos53 is not clear because the stone is there. So this action isn't valid. Player needs to take a different path.

Tracing the state progression after step 3:
- player1 is at pos43
- stone1 is at pos53

4. Player moves from pos43 to pos42 (moving up) using the "move" action.
5. Player moves from pos42 to pos52 (moving right) using the "move" action.
6. Player pushes the stone from pos53 to pos52 in the "dirleft" direction, ending up at pos53.

Hmm wait, 6 doesn't work. If player is at pos52 and the stone is at pos53, then the direction from pos52 to pos53 is "dirdown", not "dirleft". And the direction from pos53 to pos52 would be "dirup", not "dirleft". So 6 is not valid.

Actually there's a problem with my understanding. Let me reconsider the action format.

"pushtonongoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": The direction d seems to refer to the direction of the push, not necessarily the direction from l_p to l_from or from l_from to l_to.

Actually let's re-read the preconditions:
"pushtonongoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": You may only perform this action if (i) agent p is at location l_p, (ii) stone s is at location l_from, (iii) location l_to is clear, (iv) you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d, (v) you can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d, and (vi) location l_to is not a goal location.

It says "you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d". This means d is the direction from the agent to the stone. Similarly, "you can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d" means d is also the direction from the stone to the target position. So the direction d is consistent throughout, and the stone is being pushed in the same direction as the agent is approaching the stone.

In our scenario, after step 3, the player is at pos43 and the stone is at pos53. So the player needs to find a way to get behind the stone in a position where the stone can be pushed towards the goal.

Continuing from step 3:
- player1 is at pos43
- stone1 is at pos53

The player needs to position themself to push the stone left (towards pos52). So the player needs to be at pos63 (right of the stone). But pos63 doesn't exist in our grid. So we can't push the stone left directly from pos53.

Let's consider a different approach. We need to push the stone to pos51, which is at the bottom-left of our grid. If we push the stone down first, then we'd push it left. But the stone is at pos53, and we'd need to push it to pos54, pos55, which is moving away from our goal. So this doesn't seem like a good approach.

Let's reconsider our initial plan. The stone starts at pos43 and the goal is at pos51. The stone needs to move left and down. We can first push it left to pos42, then pos41, then down to pos51.

Here's a plan:

1. Player moves from pos44 to pos45 (moving down) using the "move" action.
2. Player moves from pos45 to pos35 (moving left) using the "move" action.
3. Player moves from pos35 to pos34 (moving up) using the "move" action.
4. Player moves from pos34 to pos33 (moving left) using the "move" action.
5. Player moves from pos33 to pos32 (moving left) using the "move" action.
6. Player pushes the stone from pos43 to pos33 in the "dirleft" direction.
7. Player pushes the stone from pos33 to pos23 in the "dirleft" direction.
8. Player pushes the stone from pos23 to pos13 in the "dirleft" direction.
9. [continue pushing the stone left and then down to reach pos51]

Actually, I'm starting to think that I'm missing something, The reason is that in the action descriptions, it says the effect of pushtogoal and pushtonongoal are "stone s is at a goal state" and "stone s is at a non goal state" respectively. But if the stone is at a goal state, it seems like we've already achieved our desired state. So I'm wondering if pushing the stone directly to a goal is the only action we need.

In the initial state, the stone is at pos43. To push it to a goal, we'd need to push it to pos51. But that seems too far from its current position to do in a single push.

Let me reconsider the action descriptions:
"pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": After performing this action, (i) agent p is no longer at location l_p, (ii) stone s is no longer at location l_from, (iii) location l_to is no longer clear, (iv) agent p is at location l_from, (v) stone s is at location l_to, (vi) location l_p is clear, and (vi) stone s is at a goal state.

"pushtonongoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": After performing this action, (i) agent p is no longer at location l_p, (ii) stone s is no longer at location l_from, (iii) location l_to is no longer clear, (iv) agent p is at location l_from, (v) stone s is at location l_to, (vi) location l_p is clear, and (vi) stone s is at a non goal state.

The stone can only be at a goal state if it's at a goal location, which in our case is only pos51. So we need to push the stone to pos51 and not to any other location. But to do this, we need to push it several times, moving it gradually closer to pos51.

So our revised plan is:

1. Player moves from pos44 to pos45 (moving down) using the "move" action.
2. Player moves from pos45 to pos35 (moving left) using the "move" action.
3. Player moves from pos35 to pos34 (moving left) using the "move" action.
4. Player moves from pos34 to pos33 (moving left) using the "move" action.
5. Player moves from pos33 to pos32 (moving left) using the "move" action.
6. Player pushes the stone from pos43 to pos33 in the "dirleft" direction.
7. Player pushes the stone from pos33 to pos23 in the "dirleft" direction.
8. Player pushes the stone from pos23 to pos13 in the "dirleft" direction.
9. Player moves from pos23 to pos24 (moving down) using the "move" action.
10. Player moves from pos24 to pos25 (moving down) using the "move" action.
11. Player moves from pos25 to pos15 (moving left) using the "move" action.
12. Player moves from pos15 to pos14 (moving up) using the "move" action.
13. Player pushes the stone from pos13 to pos12 in the "dirup" direction.
14. Player pushes the stone from pos12 to pos11 in the "dirup" direction.
15. Player moves from pos12 to pos13 (moving down) using the "move" action.
16. Player moves from pos13 to pos23 (moving right) using the "move" action.
17. Player moves from pos23 to pos33 (moving right) using the "move" action.
18. Player moves from pos33 to pos43 (moving right) using the "move" action.
19. Player moves from pos43 to pos42 (moving up) using the "move" action.
20. Player moves from pos42 to pos41 (moving left) using the "move" action.
21. Player moves from pos41 to pos31 (moving left) using the "move" action.
22. Player moves from pos31 to position pos21 (moving left) using the "move" action.
23. Player moves from pos21 to position pos11 (moving left) using the "move" action.
24. Player pushes the stone from pos11 to pos21 in the "dirright" direction.
25. Player pushes the stone from pos21 to pos31 in the "dirright" direction.
26. Player pushes the stone from pos31 to pos41 in the "dirright" direction.
27. Player pushes the stone from pos41 to pos51 in the "dirright" direction.

I realize I made a mistake. In step 13, if the player is at pos14 and the stone is at pos13, the direction from pos14 to pos13 is "dirleft", not "dirup".

Let me correct the plan:

1. Player moves from pos44 to pos34 (moving left) using the "move" action.
2. Player moves from pos34 to pos33 (moving left) using the "move" action.
3. Player pushes the stone from pos43 to pos42 in the "dirup" direction.
4. Player pushes the stone from pos42 to pos41 in the "dirup" direction.
5. Player pushes the stone from pos41 to pos51 in the "dirright" direction.

Wait, I made a mistake again. In step 3, if the player is at pos33 and the stone is at pos43, the direction from pos33 to pos43 is "dirdown", not "dirup".

Let me think of a more streamlined plan:

1. Player moves from pos44 to pos34 (moving left) using the "move" action.
2. Player moves from pos34 to pos24 (moving left) using the "move" action.
3. Player moves from pos24 to pos23 (moving left) using the "move" action.
4. Player moves from pos23 to pos22 (moving left) using the "move" action.
5. Player moves from pos22 to pos32 (moving right) using the "move" action.
6. Player pushes the stone from pos43 to pos42 in the "dirup" direction.
7. Player pushes the stone from pos42 to pos41 in the "dirleft" direction.
8. Player pushes the stone from pos41 to pos51 in the "dirright" direction.

I think my understanding of the directions is incorrect.

Let's go over the direction definitions in the problem:
If we have a grid where pos11 is the top-left and pos55 is the bottom-right, then:
- dirdown: Moves one step downwards (increasing the first coordinate).
- dirleft: Moves one step leftwards (decreasing the second coordinate).
- dirright: Moves one step rightwards (increasing the second coordinate).
- dirup: Moves one step upwards (decreasing the first coordinate).

So, dirdown means moving from pos(i,j) to pos(i+1, j). Dirup means moving from pos(i,j) to pos(i-1, j). Dirleft means moving from pos(i,j) to pos(i, j-1). Dirright means moving from pos(i,j) to pos(i, j+1).

Actually, I need to be careful about the directions. Here's a reference for the directions based on the given "You may move from..." statements:
- From pos11 to pos21 is dirright
- From pos11 to pos12 is dirdown
- From pos21 to pos11 is dirleft
- From pos12 to pos11 is dirup

So, dirright means moving right (increasing the first number), dirleft means moving left (decreasing the first number), dirdown means moving down (increasing the second number), and dirup means moving up (decreasing the second number).

If you look at "You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright," it suggests that pos21 is to the right of pos11. This suggests that the first number in posXY is the column index (from left to right), and the second number is the row index (from top to bottom, flipped compared to Cartesian plane).

So, the grid looks like:

```
   1  2  3  4  5
1 p11 p21 p31 p41 p51
2 p12 p22 p32 p42 p52
3 p13 p23 p33 p43 p53
4 p14 p24 p34 p44 p54
5 p15 p25 p35 p45 p55
```

With this, the player is at pos44 (right side, lower middle) and the stone is at pos43 (right, above the player). The goal is at pos51 (far right, top).

With this updated understanding, let's revise our plan:

1. Player moves from pos44 to pos34 (moving left) using the "move player1 pos44 pos34 dirleft".
2. Player moves from pos34 to pos24 (moving left) using the "move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft".
3. Player moves from pos24 to pos14 (moving left) using the "move player1 pos24 pos14 dirleft".
4. Player moves from pos14 to pos13 (moving up) using the "move player1 pos14 pos13 dirup".
5. Player moves from pos13 to pos23 (moving right) using the "move player1 pos13 pos23 dirright".
6. Player moves from pos23 to pos33 (moving right) using the "move player1 pos23 pos33 dirright".
7. Player pushes the stone from pos43 to pos53 in the "dirdown" direction using the "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos43 pos53 dirdown".
8. Player moves from pos43 to pos33 (moving up) using the "move player1 pos43 pos33 dirup".
9. Player moves from pos33 to pos32 (moving up) using the "move player1 pos33 pos32 dirup".
10. Player moves from pos32 to pos42 (moving right) using the "move player1 pos32 pos42 dirright".
11. Player moves from pos42 to pos52 (moving right) using the "move player1 pos42 pos52 dirright".
12. Player pushes the stone from pos53 to pos52 in the "dirup" direction using the "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos52 pos53 pos52 dirup".
13. Player pushes the stone from pos52 to pos51 in the "dirup" direction using the "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos52 pos52 pos51 dirup".

Wait, I made an error in steps 12 and 13. Let me correct them:

12. Player pushes the stone from pos53 to pos52 in the "dirup" direction using the "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos52 pos53 pos52 dirup".

In step 13, if the player is at pos53 and the stone is at pos52, the direction from pos53 to pos52 is "dirup". But the direction from pos52 to pos51 is "dirleft", not "dirup". So we need a different approach.

Let's trace the steps after step 11:
- player1 is at pos52
- stone1 is at pos53

12. Player pushes the stone from pos53 to pos54 in the "dirdown" direction using the "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos52 pos53 pos54 dirdown".
13. Player moves from pos53 to pos43 (moving up) using the "move player1 pos53 pos43 dirup".
14. Player moves from pos43 to pos44 (moving down) using the "move player1 pos43 pos44 dirdown".
15. Player moves from pos44 to pos45 (moving down) using the "move player1 pos44 pos45 dirdown".
16. Player moves from pos45 to pos55 (moving right) using the "move player1 pos45 pos55 dirright".
17. Player pushes the stone from pos54 to pos55 in the "dirup" direction using the "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos55 pos54 pos55 dirup".
18. [And then we'd need to find a way to push the stone from pos55 to the goal at pos51]

OK, I'm noticing that my plan is getting convoluted because the stone is moving away from the goal. Let's reconsider our approach.

From the initial state:
- player1 is at pos44
- stone1 is at pos43
- pos51 is the only goal position

Let's try a more direct approach. The goal is to move the stone to pos51, which is at the top-right corner of the grid. From pos43, it would be more direct to push the stone up to pos33, pos23, pos13, and then right to pos23, pos33, pos43, pos53, and up again to pos52, pos51.

Let's refine the plan:

1. Player moves from pos44 to pos34 (moving left) using the "move player1 pos44 pos34 dirleft".
2. Player moves from pos34 to pos24 (moving left) using the "move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft".
3. Player moves from pos24 to pos23 (moving up) using the "move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup".
4. Player moves from pos23 to pos33 (moving right) using the "move player1 pos23 pos33 dirright".
5. Player pushes the stone from pos43 to pos33 in the "dirup" direction using the "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos43 pos33 dirup".

Hmm something is going wrong. Let me think again...

I realize my interpretation of the coordinate system is wrong. The reference I got from the "you may move" statements is as follows:

- "You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright"
- "You may move from location pos11 to location pos12 following direction dirdown"
- "You may move from location pos51 to location pos41 following direction dirleft"
- "You may move from location pos15 to location pos14 following direction dirup"

This suggests a 5x5 grid with the origin at the top-left and directions:
- dirright: Moving right, increasing the first number (column).
- dirdown: Moving down, increasing the second number (row).
- dirleft: Moving left, decreasing the first number (column).
- dirup: Moving up, decreasing the second number (row).

So, the grid is as follows (using (column, row) notation):

```
    1    2    3    4    5
1 (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (4,1) (5,1)
2 (1,2) (2,2) (3,2) (4,2) (5,2)
3 (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) (4,3) (5,3)
4 (1,4) (2,4) (3,4) (4,4) (5,4)
5 (1,5) (2,5) (3,5) (4,5) (5,5)
```

With this understanding, player1 is at position (4,4), stone1 is at position (4,3), and the goal is at position (5,1). (I'm using the (column,row) notation in these explanations for clarity).

To move the stone to the goal, we would:
1. Push the stone upwards to (4,2), (4,1).
2. Push the stone rightwards to (5,1).

Let's plan it out:

Initial state:
- player1 is at (4,4)
- stone1 is at (4,3)
- goal is at (5,1)

1. Player moves from (4,4) to (3,4) (moving left) using the "move player1 pos44 pos34 dirleft".
2. Player moves from (3,4) to (3,3) (moving up) using the "move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup".
3. Player pushes the stone from (4,3) to (4,2) (pushing up) using the "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos43 pos42 dirup".
   - After this action, player1 is at (4,3) and stone1 is at (4,2).
4. Player pushes the stone from (4,2) to (4,1) (pushing up) using the "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos42 pos41 dirup".
   - After this action, player1 is at (4,2) and stone1 is at (4,1).
5. Player moves from (4,2) to (4,1) (moving up) using the "move player1 pos42 pos41 dirup".
   - Hmm wait, this doesn't make sense, because stone1 is at (4,1). This is not valid.

Let me revisit our approach and be more careful:

1. Player moves from (4,4) to (3,4) (moving left) using the "move player1 pos44 pos34 dirleft".
2. Player moves from (3,4) to (3,3) (moving up) using the "move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup".
3. Player pushes the stone from (4,3) to (4,2) (pushing up) using the "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos43 pos42 dirup".
   - After this action, player1 is at (4,3) and stone1 is at (4,2).
4. Player pushes the stone from (4,2) to (4,1) (pushing up) using the "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos42 pos41 dirup".
   - After this action, player1 is at (4,2) and stone1 is at (4,1).
5. Player moves from (4,2) to (3,2) (moving left) using the "move player1 pos42 pos32 dirleft".
6. Player moves from (3,2) to (3,1) (moving up) using the "move player1 pos32 pos31 dirup".
7. Player moves from (3,1) to (4,1) (moving right) using the "move player1 pos31 pos41 dirright".
   - This is not valid since stone1 is at (4,1). Let me correct.

Revising:

1. Player moves from (4,4) to (3,4) (moving left) using the "move player1 pos44 pos34 dirleft".
2. Player moves from (3,4) to (3,3) (moving up) using the "move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup".
3. Player pushes the stone from (4,3) to (4,2) (pushing up) using the "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos43 pos42 dirup".
   - After this action, player1 is at (4,3) and stone1 is at (4,2).
4. Player pushes the stone from (4,2) to (4,1) (pushing up) using the "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos42 pos41 dirup".
   - After this action, player1 is at (4,2) and stone1 is at (4,1).
5. Player moves from (4,2) to (3,2) (moving left) using the "move player1 pos42 pos32 dirleft".
6. Player moves from (3,2) to (2,2) (moving left) using the "move player1 pos32 pos22 dirleft".
7. Player moves from (2,2) to (2,1) (moving up) using the "move player1 pos22 pos21 dirup".
8. Player moves from (2,1) to (3,1) (moving right) using the "move player1 pos21 pos31 dirright".
9. Player pushes the stone from (4,1) to (5,1) (pushing right) using the "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos41 pos51 dirright".
   - After this action, player1 is at (4,1) and stone1 is at (5,1).

This plan seems valid. Let's step through it once more to ensure it works:

Initial state:
- player1 is at (4,4)
- stone1 is at (4,3)
- goal is at (5,1)

1. move player1 pos44 pos34 dirleft
   - player1 is at (3,4)
   - stone1 is at (4,3)
2. move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup
   - player1 is at (3,3)
   - stone1 is at (4,3)
3. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos43 pos42 dirup
   - player1 is at (4,3)
   - stone1 is at (4,2)
4. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos42 pos41 dirup
   - player1 is at (4,2)
   - stone1 is at (4,1)
5. move player1 pos42 pos32 dirleft
   - player1 is at (3,2)
   - stone1 is at (4,1)
6. move player1 pos32 pos22 dirleft
   - player1 is at (2,2)
   - stone1 is at (4,1)
7. move player1 pos22 pos21 dirup
   - player1 is at (2,1)
   - stone1 is at (4,1)
8. move player1 pos21 pos31 dirright
   - player1 is at (3,1)
   - stone1 is at (4,1)
9. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos41 pos51 dirright
   - player1 is at (4,1)
   - stone1 is at (5,1)

Afterwards, Stone should be at pos51, which is a goal state. So the goal is achieved.

Let's write out the final plan:

1. move player1 pos44 pos34 dirleft
2. move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup
3. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos43 pos42 dirup
4. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos42 pos41 dirup
5. move player1 pos42 pos32 dirleft
6. move player1 pos32 pos22 dirleft
7. move player1 pos22 pos21 dirup
8. move player1 pos21 pos31 dirright
9. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos41 pos51 dirright
