Alright, I am given a sokoban-like problem where I need to push a stone to a goal location. Let me break down the initial state and the goal:

Initial State:
- The player (player1) is at pos44
- There's a stone (stone1) at pos43
- The only goal location is pos51

Goal: 
- Move stone1 to a goal location, which is pos51.

Constraints:
1. At some point, player1 must be at pos32
2. Before player1 is at pos32, either pos44 must not be clear, or stone1 must be at pos32

Let's first understand the grid layout. From the move actions, I can infer that the grid is set up with dirdown meaning increasing the first coordinate and dirright meaning increasing the second coordinate. So, pos11 is the top-left corner, and pos55 is the bottom-right corner.

```
pos11 pos12 pos13 pos14 pos15
pos21 pos22 pos23 pos24 pos25
pos31 pos32 pos33 pos34 pos35
pos41 pos42 pos43 pos44 pos45
pos51 pos52 pos53 pos54 pos55
```

In this layout:
- player1 is at pos44 (4th row, 4th column)
- stone1 is at pos43 (4th row, 3rd column)
- The goal is at pos51 (5th row, 1st column)

To solve this problem, I need to push stone1 to pos51. I also need to ensure the constraints are met:
1. player1 must be at pos32 at some point
2. Before player1 is at pos32, either pos44 must not be clear, or stone1 must be at pos32

Let's think about a plan: I need to push stone1 from pos43 to pos51. For this, I need to get the player to positions where he can push the stone in the desired direction. But I also need to satisfy the constraints.

Let's break down the constraint (2): "Before player1 is at pos32, either pos44 must not be clear, or stone1 must be at pos32".
- If the player moves away from pos44, then pos44 will be clear. 
- So, the alternative is that stone1 must be at pos32 before the player gets to pos32.

This seems to suggest a specific path for the stone: from pos43 to pos32, and then from there to the goal pos51.

Let me plan the moves:

1. First, I need to push stone1 from pos43 to pos33 (pushing upwards, player moves from pos44 to pos43)
2. Then push stone1 from pos33 to pos32 (pushing left, player moves from pos33 to pos32)
   - At this point, stone1 is at pos32, ensuring that the constraint (2) is met
3. From pos32, I need to move stone1 to the goal pos51, which means going down and right.

Let's play out the steps:

Starting position:
```
... ... ... ... ...
... ... ... ... ...
... ... ... ... ...
... ... S P ...
G .. ... ... ...
```

1. Push stone1 up from pos43 to pos33:
```
... ... ... ... ...
... ... ... ... ...
... ... S ... ...
... ... P ... ...
G .. ... ... ...
```

2. Push stone1 left from pos33 to pos32:
```
... ... ... ... ...
... ... ... ... ...
... S P ... ...
... ... ... ... ...
G .. ... ... ...
```

3. Now, I need to push stone1 down from pos32 to pos42:
```
... ... ... ... ...
... ... ... ... ...
... ... ... ... ...
... S P ... ...
G .. ... ... ...
```

4. Push stone1 right from pos42 to pos43:
```
... ... ... ... ...
... ... ... ... ...
... ... ... ... ...
... ... S P ...
G .. ... ... ...
```

5. Push stone1 right from pos43 to pos44:
```
... ... ... ... ...
... ... ... ... ...
... ... ... ... ...
... ... ... S P
G .. ... ... ...
```

6. Push stone1 right from pos44 to pos45:
```
... ... ... ... ...
... ... ... ... ...
... ... ... ... ...
... ... ... ... S
G .. ... ... P
```

7. Push stone1 down from pos45 to pos55:
```
... ... ... ... ...
... ... ... ... ...
... ... ... ... ...
... ... ... ... ...
G .. ... ... S
```

Wait, I've made an error. The stone ended up at pos55, not the goal pos51. Let me rethink the strategy.

Let's map out the correct path from pos32 to pos51:
From pos32, I need to push stone1 to pos42, then to pos41, and finally to pos51.

Let me restart the plan:

1. Push stone1 up from pos43 to pos33 (pushing upwards, player moves from pos44 to pos43)
2. Push stone1 left from pos33 to pos32 (pushing left, player moves from pos33 to pos32)
   - At this point, stone1 is at pos32, ensuring that the constraint (2) is met
3. Push stone1 down from pos32 to pos42
4. Push stone1 left from pos42 to pos41
5. Push stone1 down from pos41 to pos51

Is this plan correct? Let's trace through it:

Starting position:
```
... ... ... ... ...
... ... ... ... ...
... ... ... ... ...
... ... S P ...
G .. ... ... ...
```

1. Push stone1 up from pos43 to pos33:
   - The player is at pos44 and the stone is at pos43
   - The player needs to move up to push the stone upwards
   - But wait, I need to check the action. The action to use would be "pushtonongoal"
   - I need to check if the action's preconditions are met:
     - player1 is at pos44 (true)
     - stone1 is at pos43 (true)
     - pos33 is clear (true)
     - You can get from pos44 to pos43 following dirup (true)
     - You can get from pos43 to pos33 following dirup (true)
     - pos33 is not a goal location (true)
   - Since all preconditions are met, I can push stone1 from pos43 to pos33

2. Push stone1 left from pos33 to pos32:
   - After the first action, the player is at pos43 and the stone is at pos33
   - The player needs to move left to push the stone leftwards
   - I'll use "pushtonongoal"
   - I need to check if the action's preconditions are met:
     - player1 is at pos43 (true)
     - stone1 is at pos33 (true)
     - pos32 is clear (true)
     - You can get from pos43 to pos33 following dirleft (true)
     - You can get from pos33 to pos32 following dirleft (true)
     - pos32 is not a goal location (true)
   - Since all preconditions are met, I can push stone1 from pos33 to pos32

3. Push stone1 down from pos32 to pos42:
   - After the second action, the player is at pos33 and the stone is at pos32
   - The player needs to move up to push the stone downwards
   - I'll use "pushtonongoal"
   - I need to check if the action's preconditions are met:
     - player1 is at pos33 (true)
     - stone1 is at pos32 (true)
     - pos42 is clear (true)
     - You can get from pos33 to pos32 following dirup (true)
     - You can get from pos32 to pos42 following dirdown (true)
     - pos42 is not a goal location (true)
   - Since all preconditions are met, I can push stone1 from pos32 to pos42

4. Push stone1 left from pos42 to pos41:
   - After the third action, the player is at pos32 and the stone is at pos42
   - The player needs to move down to push the stone leftwards
   - I'll use "pushtonongoal"
   - I need to check if the action's preconditions are met:
     - player1 is at pos32 (false)
   - Oops, I made a mistake. After pushing stone1 from pos32 to pos42, the player is at pos32, not pos33. Let me recalculate.

In step 3, the player is at pos33 and the stone is at pos32. After pushing the stone to pos42, the player will be at pos32.

So, after the third action, the player is at pos32 and the stone is at pos42.

4. Push stone1 left from pos42 to pos41:
   - After the third action, the player is at pos32 and the stone is at pos42
   - The player needs to move down to push the stone leftwards
   - I'll use "pushtonongoal"
   - I need to check if the action's preconditions are met:
     - player1 is at pos32 (true)
     - stone1 is at pos42 (true)
     - pos41 is clear (true)
     - You can get from pos32 to pos42 following dirdown (true)
     - You can get from pos42 to pos41 following dirleft (true)
     - pos41 is not a goal location (true)
   - Hmm, but I think there's a problem. I first need to move from pos32 to pos42, and then push the stone.

Let me back up. After step 3, the player would be at pos33, not at pos32. After pushing stone1 from pos33 to pos32, the player will be at pos33.

Then, to push stone1 from pos32 to pos42, the player needs to move from pos33 to pos32 and then push. After this action, the player would be at pos32.

Alright, I made a mistake earlier. Let me restart with the correct understanding:

1. Push stone1 up from pos43 to pos33:
   - Starting: player at pos44, stone at pos43
   - Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos43 pos33 dirup
   - End: player at pos43, stone at pos33

2. Push stone1 left from pos33 to pos32:
   - Starting: player at pos43, stone at pos33
   - Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos33 pos32 dirleft
   - End: player at pos33, stone at pos32
     (Now the constraint that stone1 must be at pos32 before player1 gets to pos32 is true)

3. Now, I need to move the player to pos32, and then push the stone to pos42:
   - Starting: player at pos33, stone at pos32
   - Action: move player1 pos33 pos32 dirleft
   - End: player at pos32, stone at pos32
     (This satisfies the constraint that player1 must be at pos32 at some point)

4. Push stone1 down from pos32 to pos42:
   - Starting: player at pos32, stone at pos32
   - Wait, this doesn't make sense. If the player and the stone are at the same position, then the precondition for "pushtonongoal" won't be met.

I think I'm misunderstanding some part of the problem or action definitions. Let me read through them again.

Actually, based on the description, it seems like the player and the stone can't be at the same position. The player is at a location l_p, and the stone is at a different location l_from.

For the action "pushtonongoal p s l_p l_from l_to d", the player is at location l_p, and the stone is at location l_from. The player moves from l_p to l_from following direction d, and then pushes the stone from l_from to l_to.

So, after step 2, the player is at pos33 and the stone is at pos32. If the player wants to push the stone from pos32 to pos42, the player needs to be at a position where, by moving in some direction, they would reach pos32.

From the connectivity information, I know that the player can move from pos33 to pos32 following dirleft, and from pos32 to pos42 following dirdown.

Let's redo the plan:

1. Push stone1 up from pos43 to pos33:
   - Starting: player at pos44, stone at pos43
   - Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos43 pos33 dirup
   - End: player at pos43, stone at pos33

2. Push stone1 left from pos33 to pos32:
   - Starting: player at pos43, stone at pos33
   - Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos33 pos32 dirleft
   - End: player at pos33, stone at pos32
     (Now the constraint that stone1 must be at pos32 before player1 gets to pos32 is true)

3. Push stone1 down from pos32 to pos42:
   - Starting: player at pos33, stone at pos32
   - Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos32 pos42 dirdown
   - End: player at pos32, stone at pos42
     (This satisfies the constraint that player1 must be at pos32 at some point)

4. Push stone1 left from pos42 to pos41:
   - Starting: player at pos32, stone at pos42
   - I need to get to a position from which I can push the stone left. That would be pos42, and I need to be to the right of the stone. But to get to pos42, I need to move from pos32 to pos42.
   - Action: move player1 pos32 pos42 dirdown
   - End: player at pos42, stone at pos42
     This doesn't make sense. I can't have the player and the stone at the same position.

Let me go back to the action definitions:
"pushtonongoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": Make agent p, situated at location l_p, push stone s from location l_from to non-goal location l_to, following direction d.

The preconditions state: (i) agent p is at location l_p, (ii) stone s is at location l_from, (iii) location l_to is clear, (iv) you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d, (v) you can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d, and (vi) location l_to is not a goal location.

This means that the player doesn't need to be adjacent to the stone; they just need to be able to move in a direction to reach the stone. After the action, the player will be at the stone's original position, and the stone will be at the new position.

From pos32, I can get to pos42 following dirdown. And from pos42, I can get to pos41 following dirleft. So, I should be able to push the stone directly from pos42 to pos41.

Let's revise the plan:

1. Push stone1 up from pos43 to pos33:
   - Starting: player at pos44, stone at pos43
   - Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos43 pos33 dirup
   - End: player at pos43, stone at pos33

2. Push stone1 left from pos33 to pos32:
   - Starting: player at pos43, stone at pos33
   - Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos33 pos32 dirleft
   - End: player at pos33, stone at pos32
     (Now the constraint that stone1 must be at pos32 before player1 gets to pos32 is true)

3. Push stone1 down from pos32 to pos42:
   - Starting: player at pos33, stone at pos32
   - Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos32 pos42 dirdown
   - End: player at pos32, stone at pos42
     (This satisfies the constraint that player1 must be at pos32 at some point)

4. Push stone1 left from pos42 to pos41:
   - Starting: player at pos32, stone at pos42
   - Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos42 pos41 dirleft
   - End: player at pos42, stone at pos41

5. Push stone1 right from pos41 to pos51 (the goal):
   - Starting: player at pos42, stone at pos41
   - Action: pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos41 pos51 dirright
   - End: player at pos41, stone at pos51 (which is a goal location)

Wait, I made a mistake. I confused directions. In this domain, dirdown means moving down (increasing the first coordinate), and dirright means moving right (increasing the second coordinate). 

So, from pos42 to pos41, I'd be moving left, which is dirleft, not dirright. And from pos41 to pos51, I'd be moving down, which is dirdown, not dirright.

Let me redo step 5:

5. Push stone1 down from pos41 to pos51 (the goal):
   - Starting: player at pos42, stone at pos41
   - Action: pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos41 pos51 dirdown
   - End: player at pos41, stone at pos51 (which is a goal location)

Let me double-check the preconditions for each action:

1. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos43 pos33 dirup:
   - player1 is at pos44 (true)
   - stone1 is at pos43 (true)
   - pos33 is clear (true)
   - You can get from pos44 to pos43 following dirup (true)
   - You can get from pos43 to pos33 following dirup (true)
   - pos33 is not a goal location (true)
   All preconditions are met.

2. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos33 pos32 dirleft:
   - player1 is at pos43 (true after step 1)
   - stone1 is at pos33 (true after step 1)
   - pos32 is clear (true)
   - You can get from pos43 to pos33 following dirleft (true)
   - You can get from pos33 to pos32 following dirleft (true)
   - pos32 is not a goal location (true)
   All preconditions are met.

3. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos32 pos42 dirdown:
   - player1 is at pos33 (true after step 2)
   - stone1 is at pos32 (true after step 2)
   - pos42 is clear (true)
   - You can get from pos33 to pos32 following dirleft (true)
   - You can get from pos32 to pos42 following dirdown (true)
   - pos42 is not a goal location (true)
   Wait, I said in the precondition check that I can get from pos33 to pos32 following dirleft, but the action uses dirdown. This is wrong.

Let me check if I can get from pos33 to pos32 following dirup (which is my understanding of dirdown now). Wait, this doesn't make sense. dirdown should mean moving down, not up. let me review the connections again.

Looks like I am mixed-up on directions.
Let me clarify:
- dirup means moving from a location with a higher first coordinate to a location with a lower first coordinate (moving upwards on the grid).
- dirdown means moving from a location with a lower first coordinate to a location with a higher first coordinate (moving downwards on the grid).
- dirleft means moving from a location with a higher second coordinate to a location with a lower second coordinate (moving leftwards on the grid).
- dirright means moving from a location with a lower second coordinate to a location with a higher second coordinate (moving rightwards on the grid).

For example, when you may move from pos11 to pos21 following direction dirright, it means moving from (1,1) to (2,1), which is a move to the right on the grid.

Let me verify:

```
pos11 pos12 pos13 pos14 pos15
pos21 pos22 pos23 pos24 pos25
pos31 pos32 pos33 pos34 pos35
pos41 pos42 pos43 pos44 pos45
pos51 pos52 pos53 pos54 pos55
```

From the connectivity, I can verify:
- You can move from pos11 to pos21 following dirright (i.e., from (1,1) to (2,1) moving rightwards)
- You can move from pos11 to pos12 following dirdown (i.e., from (1,1) to (1,2) moving downwards)

But wait, this doesn't match with my interpretation. Let me try again:
- You can move from pos11 to pos21 following dirright (Increasing the first coordinate)
- You can move from pos11 to pos12 following dirdown (Increasing the second coordinate)

It seems like dirright means moving to a location with a higher first coordinate, and dirdown means moving to a location with a higher second coordinate. This doesn't align with the traditional grid representation.

Let me reconsider the layout keeping in mind the connections:
- If dirright means from pos11 to pos21, then dirright means moving from the left column to the right column.
- If dirdown means from pos11 to pos12, then dirdown means moving from the top row to the bottom row.

So, the grid might look like:
```
pos11 pos21 pos31 pos41 pos51
pos12 pos22 pos32 pos42 pos52
pos13 pos23 pos33 pos43 pos53
pos14 pos24 pos34 pos44 pos54
pos15 pos25 pos35 pos45 pos55
```

Actually, the way I infer the problem, the grid layout is like this:

```
pos11 pos12 pos13 pos14 pos15
pos21 pos22 pos23 pos24 pos25
pos31 pos32 pos33 pos34 pos35
pos41 pos42 pos43 pos44 pos45
pos51 pos52 pos53 pos54 pos55
```

And the directions work like:
- dirdown means moving from a location with a lower first coordinate to a location with a higher first coordinate (moving downwards on the grid).
- dirup means moving from a location with a higher first coordinate to a location with a lower first coordinate (moving upwards on the grid).
- dirleft means moving from a location with a higher second coordinate to a location with a lower second coordinate (moving leftwards on the grid).
- dirright means moving from a location with a lower second coordinate to a location with a higher second coordinate (moving rightwards on the grid).

Let me test this understanding with a few connectivity examples:
- You can move from pos11 to pos21 following dirright (This is moving down in my grid, but listed as dirright). Actually, this doesn't match.

My confusion stems from the interpretation of the coordinates. Let me unambiguously state the interpretation I'll use:
- The grid is a 5x5 grid.
- posXY represents the position at the X-th row and Y-th column.
- X and Y both range from 1 to 5.
- dirdown, dirup, dirleft, dirright refer to the standard directions on the grid.

Given the initial state:
- player1 is at pos44 (4th row, 4th column)
- stone1 is at pos43 (4th row, 3rd column)
- The goal is at pos51 (5th row, 1st column)

And the connectivity:
- You can move from pos11 to pos21 following dirright (from 1st row, 1st column to 2nd row, 1st column)

This connectivity suggest that dirright means moving from a lower row number to a higher row number (moving downwards on a traditional grid, which isn't the standard definition of "right").

This is confusing me, so let me just verify the grid layout using the connectivity:
- You can move from pos11 to pos21 following dirright (from pos(1,1) to pos(2,1))
- You can move from pos11 to pos12 following dirdown (from pos(1,1) to pos(1,2))

I think it's clearer now. In this notation:
- The first coordinate corresponds to rows, and the second coordinate corresponds to columns.
- dirright means moving from a lower row number to a higher row number (moving down on a traditional grid).
- dirdown means moving from a lower column number to a higher column number (moving right on a traditional grid).
- dirleft means moving from a higher row number to a lower row number (moving up on a traditional grid).
- dirup means moving from a higher column number to a lower column number (moving left on a traditional grid).

This notation is confusing, so I'll stick to the coordinates and not the direction names.

Ok, now let me check the preconditions for each action:

1. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos43 pos33 dirup:
   - player1 is at pos44 (true)
   - stone1 is at pos43 (true)
   - pos33 is clear (true)
   - You can get from pos44 to pos43 following dirup (means moving from (4,4) to (4,3), which is towards the left on my traditional grid, and is consistent with the connectivity "You may move from location pos44 to location pos43 following direction dirup")
   - You can get from pos43 to pos33 following dirup (means moving from (4,3) to (3,3), which is towards the top on my traditional grid, and is consistent with the connectivity "You may move from location pos43 to location pos33 following direction dirup")
   - pos33 is not a goal location (true)
   Oh, I see that "You may move from location pos43 to location pos33 following direction dirup" is actually listed in the long connectivity statements. So dirup  can mean moving upwards on the grid.

Alright, let me follow the grid layout
```
pos11 pos12 pos13 pos14 pos15
pos21 pos22 pos23 pos24 pos25
pos31 pos32 pos33 pos34 pos35
pos41 pos42 pos43 pos44 pos45
pos51 pos52 pos53 pos54 pos55
```

But I need to be careful with the direction names. I'll rely on the connectivity statements to determine the valid moves.

Let's re-plan:

1. Push stone1 from pos43 to pos33 (pushing upwards):
   - Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos43 pos33 dirup

2. Move player1 from pos43 to pos33:
   - Action: move player1 pos43 pos33 dirup

3. Push stone1 from pos33 to pos32 (pushing leftwards):
   - Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos33 pos32 dirleft

Wait, I got confused again: after pushing stone1 from pos43 to pos33, the player would already be at pos43, not pos44. So I should directly push stone1 from pos33 to pos32.

Let's try again:

1. Push stone1 from pos43 to pos33 (pushing upwards):
   - Starting: player at pos44, stone at pos43
   - Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos43 pos33 dirup
   - End: player at pos43, stone at pos33

2. Push stone1 from pos33 to pos32 (pushing leftwards):
   - Starting: player at pos43, stone at pos33
   - Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos33 pos32 dirleft
   - End: player at pos33, stone at pos32

3. Push stone1 from pos32 to pos42 (pushing downwards):
   - Starting: player at pos33, stone at pos32
   - Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos32 pos42 dirdown
   - End: player at pos32, stone at pos42

4. Push stone1 from pos42 to pos41 (pushing leftwards):
   - Starting: player at pos32, stone at pos42
   - I need to get to a position from which I can push the stone leftwards. That would be pos43.
   - Action: move player1 pos32 pos42 dirdown
   - End: player at pos42, stone at pos42 (this doesn't make sense, the stone is already at pos42)

  Oh, I need to position player1 adjacent to the stone to push it. The player is current at pos32, and the stone is at pos42. To push the stone from pos42 to pos41, the player needs to be at pos43.
   - Action: move player1 pos32 pos33 dirright
   - End: player at pos33, stone at pos42

   Ah, I realize I don't fully understand the actions and the problem. Let me inspect the actions again:
    "pushtonongoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": Make agent p, situated at location l_p, push stone s from location l_from to non-goal location l_to, following direction d.

    The preconditions state, among others, "you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d". This seems to imply that the agent doesn't have to be immediately adjacent to the stone, but just needs to be able to move towards the stone in a particular direction.

    After the action, "agent p is at location l_from, stone s is at location l_to". This means the agent ends up at the stone's original position, and the stone moves to the new position.

    So, to push the stone from pos42 to pos41, I need to be able to move from my position (pos32) to the stone's position (pos42) in the direction I want to push.

Let me start from the beginning and trace through the steps:

1. Push stone1 from pos43 to pos33 (pushing upwards):
   - I need to check if I can get from pos44 to pos43 following dirup.
   - The connectivity statement "You may move from location pos44 to location pos43 following direction dirup" confirms this.
   - I also need to check if I can get from pos43 to pos33 following dirup.
   - The connectivity statement "You may move from location pos43 to location pos33 following direction dirup" confirms this.
   - Starting: player at pos44, stone at pos43
   - Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos43 pos33 dirup
   - End: player at pos43, stone at pos33

2. Push stone1 from pos33 to pos32 (pushing leftwards):
   - I need to check if I can get from pos43 to pos33 following dirleft.
   - The connectivity statement "You may move from location pos43 to location pos33 following direction dirleft" confirms this.
   - I also need to check if I can get from pos33 to pos32 following dirleft.
   - The connectivity statement "You may move from location pos33 to location pos32 following direction dirleft" confirms this.
   - Starting: player at pos43, stone at pos33
   - Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos33 pos32 dirleft
   - End: player at pos33, stone at pos32

3. Push stone1 from pos32 to pos42 (pushing downwards):
   - I need to check if I can get from pos33 to pos32 following dirdown.
   - However, the connectivity statement "You may move from location pos33 to location pos32 following direction dirleft" only allows moving left, not down.
   - This means I can't push the stone from pos32 to pos42 while standing at pos33.

Let me choose a different approach:

1. Push stone1 from pos43 to pos33 (pushing upwards):
   - Starting: player at pos44, stone at pos43
   - Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos43 pos33 dirup
   - End: player at pos43, stone at pos33

2. Push stone1 from pos33 to pos32 (pushing leftwards):
   - Starting: player at pos43, stone at pos33
   - Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos33 pos32 dirleft
   - End: player at pos33, stone at pos32
   (At this point, stone1 is at pos32, fulfilling the constraint that stone1 must be at pos32 before player1 gets to pos32)

3. Move player1 from pos33 to pos32:
   - Starting: player at pos33, stone at pos32
   - Action: move player1 pos33 pos32 dirleft
   - End: player at pos32, stone at pos32 (wait, this doesn't make sense, the stone is already at pos32)

I was confused before, but now I understand: the player and the stone can't be at the same position. If the stone is at pos32, then the player can't move to pos32.

In the second constraint: "If expression 'player1 is at location pos32' holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: 'At least one of the following conditions is true: "Location pos44 is not clear", "stone1 is at location pos32"'".

Given the initial state, pos44 is not clear (since the player is there). So the constraint is already satisfied. I just need to ensure that player1 is at pos32 at some point.

Let's change the plan:

1. Push stone1 from pos43 to pos33 (pushing upwards):
   - Starting: player at pos44, stone at pos43
   - Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos43 pos33 dirup
   - End: player at pos43, stone at pos33

2. Move player1 from pos43 to pos42:
   - Starting: player at pos43, stone at pos33
   - Action: move player1 pos43 pos42 dirleft
   - End: player at pos42, stone at pos33

3. Move player1 from pos42 to pos32:
   - Starting: player at pos42, stone at pos33
   - Action: move player1 pos42 pos32 dirup
   - End: player at pos32, stone at pos33
   (This satisfies the constraint that player1 must be at pos32 at some point)

4. Move player1 from pos32 to pos33:
   - Starting: player at pos32, stone at pos33
   - Action: move player1 pos32 pos33 dirright
   - End: player at pos33, stone at pos33 (wait, this doesn't make sense, the stone is already at pos33)

I got confused again. Let me clarify the grid:
```
pos11 pos12 pos13 pos14 pos15
pos21 pos22 pos23 pos24 pos25
pos31 pos32 pos33 pos34 pos35
pos41 pos42 pos43 pos44 pos45
pos51 pos52 pos53 pos54 pos55
```

And the initial positions:
- Player at pos44 (4th row, 4th column)
- Stone at pos43 (4th row, 3rd column)
- Goal at pos51 (5th row, 1st column)

I got confused about the actions. Let me clarify the push action:
"pushtonongoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": Make agent p, situated at location l_p, push stone s from location l_from to non-goal location l_to, following direction d.

The preconditions state:
(i) agent p is at location l_p
(ii) stone s is at location l_from
(iii) location l_to is clear
(iv) you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d
(v) you can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d
(vi) location l_to is not a goal location

From this, I infer that the agent pushes the stone by moving in the direction d. The agent doesn't need to be adjacent to the stone, but there needs to be a direct path from the agent to the stone in the direction d.

For example, if the agent is at (4,4) and the stone is at (4,3), the agent can push the stone from (4,3) to (4,2) by moving in the direction dirleft (or dirup, depending on how the directions are defined).

And the effects of this action:
(i) agent p is no longer at location l_p
(ii) stone s is no longer at location l_from
(iii) location l_to is no longer clear
(iv) agent p is at location l_from
(v) stone s is at location l_to
(vi) location l_p is clear
(vii) stone s is at a non goal state

So, after the push action, the agent is at the stone's original position, the stone is at the new position, and the agent's original position is clear.

Let's try the plan again:

1. Push stone1 from pos43 to pos33 (moving stone upwards):
   - Check if player1 is at pos44: true.
   - Check if stone1 is at pos43: true.
   - Check if pos33 is clear: true.
   - Check if player1 can move from pos44 to pos43 following dirup: true.
   - Check if stone1 can move from pos43 to pos33 following dirup: true.
   - Check if pos33 is not a goal location: true.
   - All preconditions for pushtonongoal are met.
   - After action: player1 is at pos43, stone1 is at pos33, pos44 is clear.

2. Move player1 from pos43 to pos42:
   - Check if player1 is at pos43: true.
   - Check if pos42 is clear: true.
   - Check if player1 can move from pos43 to pos42 following dirleft: true.
   - All preconditions for move are met.
   - After action: player1 is at pos42, pos43 is clear.

3. Move player1 from pos42 to pos32:
   - Check if player1 is at pos42: true.
   - Check if pos32 is clear: true.
   - Check if player1 can move from pos42 to pos32 following dirup: true.
   - All preconditions for move are met.
   - After action: player1 is at pos32, pos42 is clear.
   (This satisfies the constraint that player1 must be at pos32 at some point.)

4. Move player1 from pos32 to pos31:
   - Check if player1 is at pos32: true.
   - Check if pos31 is clear: true.
   - Check if player1 can move from pos32 to pos31 following dirleft: true.
   - All preconditions for move are met.
   - After action: player1 is at pos31, pos32 is clear.

5. Move player1 from pos31 to pos41:
   - Check if player1 is at pos31: true.
   - Check if pos41 is clear: true.
   - Check if player1 can move from pos31 to pos41 following dirdown: true.
   - All preconditions for move are met.
   - After action: player1 is at pos41, pos31 is clear.

6. Push stone1 from pos33 to pos43 (moving stone downwards):
   - Check if player1 is at pos41: true.
   - Check if stone1 is at pos33: true.
   - Check if pos43 is clear: true (from step 2).
   - Check if player1 can move from pos41 to pos33 following dirright: There's no direct connection, so I'd need to move through pos42 and pos32. This is not possible for a push action.

Let me rethink. The constraint requires that player1 be at pos32 at some point, and before that happens, either pos44 should not be clear or stone1 should be at pos32.

Initially, pos44 is not clear (because player1 is there). So the constraint is already satisfied as long as player1 is at pos32 at some point.

Let's take a different approach:

1. Move player1 from pos44 to pos34:
   - Check if player1 is at pos44: true.
   - Check if pos34 is clear: true.
   - Check if player1 can move from pos44 to pos34 following dirup: true.
   - All preconditions for move are met.
   - After action: player1 is at pos34, pos44 is clear.

2. Move player1 from pos34 to pos33:
   - Check if player1 is at pos34: true.
   - Check if pos33 is clear: true.
   - Check if player1 can move from pos34 to pos33 following dirleft: true.
   - All preconditions for move are met.
   - After action: player1 is at pos33, pos34 is clear.

3. Move player1 from pos33 to pos32:
   - Check if player1 is at pos33: true.
   - Check if pos32 is clear: true.
   - Check if player1 can move from pos33 to pos32 following dirleft: true.
   - All preconditions for move are met.
   - After action: player1 is at pos32, pos33 is clear.
   (This satisfies the constraint that player1 must be at pos32 at some point.)

4. Move player1 from pos32 to pos33:
   - Check if player1 is at pos32: true.
   - Check if pos33 is clear: true.
   - Check if player1 can move from pos32 to pos33 following dirright: true.
   - All preconditions for move are met.
   - After action: player1 is at pos33, pos32 is clear.

5. Move player1 from pos33 to pos43:
   - Check if player1 is at pos33: true.
   - Check if pos43 is clear: true.
   - Check if player1 can move from pos33 to pos43 following dirdown: true.
   - All preconditions for move are met.
   - After action: player1 is at pos43, pos33 is clear.

6. Push stone1 from pos43 to pos53 (moving stone downwards):
   - Wait, stone1 is not at pos43, it's at pos43 from the initial state. But player1 has moved from pos44 to pos43, so the stone is not there anymore. This plan doesn't work.

Actually, I misunderstood the actions. The stone's location is independent of the player's location unless a push action is performed. Just because the player moves from one location to another doesn't mean the stone moves as well.

Let me reconsider the initial state:
- Player at pos44
- Stone at pos43
- Goal at pos51

Let me be very careful and trace through the actions step by step.

I need to push stone1 from pos43 to pos51 (the goal).

There are several ways to do this:
1. Push stone1 from pos43 to pos53, then to pos52, then to pos51.
2. Push stone1 from pos43 to pos42, then to pos41, then to pos51.

I'll go with the second option, ensuring that the player is at pos32 at some point.

Let's trace each step carefully:

1. Push stone1 from pos43 to pos42 (moving stone leftwards):
   - Player is initially at pos44, stone is at pos43.
   - Player can move from pos44 to pos43 using dirleft.
   - Stone can move from pos43 to pos42 using dirleft.
   - Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos43 pos42 dirleft
   - After action: player1 is at pos43, stone1 is at pos42, pos44 is clear.

2. Move player1 from pos43 to pos33:
   - Check if player1 is at pos43: true.
   - Check if pos33 is clear: true.
   - Check if player1 can move from pos43 to pos33 following dirup: true.
   - All preconditions for move are met.
   - After action: player1 is at pos33, pos43 is clear.

3. Move player1 from pos33 to pos32:
   - Check if player1 is at pos33: true.
   - Check if pos32 is clear: true.
   - Check if player1 can move from pos33 to pos32 following dirleft: true.
   - All preconditions for move are met.
   - After action: player1 is at pos32, pos33 is clear.
   (This satisfies the constraint that player1 must be at pos32 at some point.)

4. Move player1 from pos32 to pos42:
   - Check if player1 is at pos32: true.
   - Check if pos42 is not clear (since stone1 is there): This is a problem.

Let me try a different approach:

1. Push stone1 from pos43 to pos33 (moving stone upwards):
   - Player is initially at pos44, stone is at pos43.
   - Player can move from pos44 to pos43 using dirup.
   - Stone can move from pos43 to pos33 using dirup.
   - Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos43 pos33 dirup
   - After action: player1 is at pos43, stone1 is at pos33, pos44 is clear.

2. Push stone1 from pos33 to pos32 (moving stone leftwards):
   - Check if player1 is at pos43: true.
   - Check if stone1 is at pos33: true.
   - Check if pos32 is clear: true.
   - Check if player1 can move from pos43 to pos33 following dirleft: There's no direct connection, so I'd need to move through other positions.

Alright, I think I need to ensure that the player is adjacent to the stone to push it.

Let's take a step back. The constraint requires that player1 be at pos32 at some point, and before that happens, either pos44 should not be clear or stone1 should be at pos32.

Initially, pos44 is not clear (because player1 is there). So as long as player1 is at pos32 at some point, the constraint is satisfied.

Now let's formulate a plan to push stone1 to the goal pos51:

1. Move player1 from pos44 to pos43 (to be adjacent to stone1):
   - Starting: player at pos44, stone at pos43
   - Action: move player1 pos44 pos43 dirup
   - End: player at pos43, stone at pos43 (this doesn't make sense, the stone is already at pos43)

I'm still confused. The initial setup states "player1 is at location pos44" and "stone1 is at location pos43", but also states "Location pos43 is clear" and "Location pos44 is clear". This seems contradictory.

Actually, it's stated that:
"player1 is at location pos44" and "stone1 is at location pos43" and
"Location pos43 is clear" and "Location pos44 is clear".

This is a contradiction, since a location with an agent or stone cannot be clear. I think this is an oversight in the problem statement.

Alright. Assuming that the positions pos43 (where stone1 is) and pos44 (where player1 is) are not clear, let's try to come up with a valid plan:

1. Push stone1 from pos43 to pos33 (pushing upward):
   - Check if player1 is at pos44: true.
   - Check if stone1 is at pos43: true.
   - Check if pos33 is clear: true.
   - Check if player1 can move from pos44 to pos43 following dirup: true.
   - Check if stone1 can move from pos43 to pos33 following dirup: true.
   - Check if pos33 is not a goal location: true.
   - All preconditions for pushtonongoal are met.
   - Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos43 pos33 dirup
   - After action: player1 is at pos43, stone1 is at pos33, pos44 is clear.

2. Move player1 from pos43 to pos42:
   - Check if player1 is at pos43: true.
   - Check if pos42 is clear: true.
   - Check if player1 can move from pos43 to pos42 following dirleft: true.
   - All preconditions for move are met.
   - Action: move player1 pos43 pos42 dirleft
   - After action: player1 is at pos42, pos43 is clear.

3. Move player1 from pos42 to pos32:
   - Check if player1 is at pos42: true.
   - Check if pos32 is clear: true.
   - Check if player1 can move from pos42 to pos32 following dirup: true.
   - All preconditions for move are met.
   - Action: move player1 pos42 pos32 dirup
   - After action: player1 is at pos32, pos42 is clear.
   (This satisfies the constraint that player1 must be at pos32 at some point.)

4. Move player1 from pos32 to pos33:
   - Check if player1 is at pos32: true.
   - Check if pos33 is clear: false (since stone1 is there).
   - This move is not valid.

Let me try a different path:

1. Push stone1 from pos43 to pos42 (pushing leftward):
   - Check if player1 is at pos44: true.
   - Check if stone1 is at pos43: true.
   - Check if pos42 is clear: true.
   - Check if player1 can move from pos44 to pos43 following dirleft: true.
   - Check if stone1 can move from pos43 to pos42 following dirleft: true.
   - Check if pos42 is not a goal location: true.
   - All preconditions for pushtonongoal are met.
   - Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos43 pos42 dirleft
   - After action: player1 is at pos43, stone1 is at pos42, pos44 is clear.

2. Push stone1 from pos42 to pos32 (pushing upward):
   - Check if player1 is at pos43: true.
   - Check if stone1 is at pos42: true.
   - Check if pos32 is clear: true.
   - Check if player1 can move from pos43 to pos42 following dirup: false.
   - This push is not valid.

Let me try another path:

1. Move player1 from pos44 to pos34:
   - Check if player1 is at pos44: true.
   - Check if pos34 is clear: true.
   - Check if player1 can move from pos44 to pos34 following dirup: true.
   - All preconditions for move are met.
   - Action: move player1 pos44 pos34 dirup
   - After action: player1 is at pos34, pos44 is clear.

2. Move player1 from pos34 to pos33:
   - Check if player1 is at pos34: true.
   - Check if pos33 is clear: true.
   - Check if player1 can move from pos34 to pos33 following dirleft: true.
   - All preconditions for move are met.
   - Action: move player1 pos34 pos33 dirleft
   - After action: player1 is at pos33, pos34 is clear.

3. Move player1 from pos33 to pos32:
   - Check if player1 is at pos33: true.
   - Check if pos32 is clear: true.
   - Check if player1 can move from pos33 to pos32 following dirleft: true.
   - All preconditions for move are met.
   - Action: move player1 pos33 pos32 dirleft
   - After action: player1 is at pos32, pos33 is clear.
   (This satisfies the constraint that player1 must be at pos32 at some point.)

4. Move player1 from pos32 to pos42:
   - Check if player1 is at pos32: true.
   - Check if pos42 is clear: true.
   - Check if player1 can move from pos32 to pos42 following dirdown: true.
   - All preconditions for move are met.
   - Action: move player1 pos32 pos42 dirdown
   - After action: player1 is at pos42, pos32 is clear.

5. Push stone1 from pos43 to pos42 (pushing leftward):
   - Wait, player1 is already at pos42. This push is not valid.

I think I'm having difficulty understanding the problem. Let me read it more carefully.

The push actions are:
"pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": Make agent p, situated at location l_p, push stone s from location l_from to goal location l_to, following direction d.
"pushtonongoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": Make agent p, situated at location l_p, push stone s from location l_from to non-goal location l_to, following direction d.

The preconditions are:
(i) agent p is at location l_p
(ii) stone s is at location l_from
(iii) location l_to is clear
(iv) you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d
(v) you can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d
(vi) location l_to is a goal location (for pushtogoal) or not a goal location (for pushtonongoal)

From this, I gather that the agent doesn't have to be adjacent to the stone. The agent just needs to be on a line with the stone and the destination of the stone, following the direction d. Let me guess few examples:

1. If the agent is at pos44, the stone is at pos43, and I want to push the stone to pos42, the direction would be dirleft (from the perspective of the player).
2. If the agent is at pos32, the stone is at pos42, and I want to push the stone to pos43, the direction would be dirright.

Hmm, I think my previous interpretation should be correct. Let's try a simple path:

1. Push stone1 from pos43 to pos42 (pushing leftward):
   - Check if player1 is at pos44: true.
   - Check if stone1 is at pos43: true.
   - Check if pos42 is clear: true.
   - Check if player1 can move from pos44 to pos43 following dirleft: true.
   - Check if stone1 can move from pos43 to pos42 following dirleft: true.
   - Check if pos42 is not a goal location: true.
   - All preconditions for pushtonongoal are met.
   - Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos43 pos42 dirleft
   - After action: player1 is at pos43, stone1 is at pos42, pos44 is clear.

2. Push stone1 from pos42 to pos41 (pushing leftward):
   - Check if player1 is at pos43: true.
   - Check if stone1 is at pos42: true.
   - Check if pos41 is clear: true.
   - Check if player1 can move from pos43 to pos42 following dirleft: true.
   - Check if stone1 can move from pos42 to pos41 following dirleft: true.
   - Check if pos41 is not a goal location: true.
   - All preconditions for pushtonongoal are met.
   - Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos42 pos41 dirleft
   - After action: player1 is at pos42, stone1 is at pos41, pos43 is clear.

3. Push stone1 from pos41 to pos31 (pushing upward):
   - Check if player1 is at pos42: true.
   - Check if stone1 is at pos41: true.
   - Check if pos31 is clear: true.
   - Check if player1 can move from pos42 to pos41 following dirleft: true.
   - Check if stone1 can move from pos41 to pos31 following dirup: true.
   - Check if pos31 is not a goal location: true.
   - All preconditions for pushtonongoal are met.
   - Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos41 pos31 dirup
   - After action: player1 is at pos41, stone1 is at pos31, pos42 is clear.

4. Move player1 from pos41 to pos42:
   - Check if player1 is at pos41: true.
   - Check if pos42 is clear: true.
   - Check if player1 can move from pos41 to pos42 following dirright: true.
   - All preconditions for move are met.
   - Action: move player1 pos41 pos42 dirright
   - After action: player1 is at pos42, pos41 is clear.

5. Move player1 from pos42 to pos32:
   - Check if player1 is at pos42: true.
   - Check if pos32 is clear: true.
   - Check if player1 can move from pos42 to pos32 following dirup: true.
   - All preconditions for move are met.
   - Action: move player1 pos42 pos32 dirup
   - After action: player1 is at pos32, pos42 is clear.
   (This satisfies the constraint that player1 must be at pos32 at some point.)

6. Move player1 from pos32 to pos31:
   - Check if player1 is at pos32: true.
   - Check if pos31 is not clear (since stone1 is there): This is a problem.

Let me consider the problem again. I think I'm overcomplicating it. But I want to check the constraints once more:

Constraints:
1. At some point, player1 must be at pos32.
2. Before player1 is at pos32, either pos44 must not be clear, or stone1 must be at pos32.

For constraint 2, initially pos44 is not clear because the player is there. So, regardless of when and how player1 gets to pos32, the constraint 2 is already satisfied.

With that clarified, I'll focus on getting the stone to the goal location:

1. Push stone1 from pos43 to pos42 (pushing leftward):
   - Check if player1 is at pos44: true.
   - Check if stone1 is at pos43: true.
   - Check if pos42 is clear: true.
   - Check if player1 can move from pos44 to pos43 following dirleft: true.
   - Check if stone1 can move from pos43 to pos42 following dirleft: true.
   - Check if pos42 is not a goal location: true.
   - All preconditions for pushtonongoal are met.
   - Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos43 pos42 dirleft
   - After action: player1 is at pos43, stone1 is at pos42, pos44 is clear.

2. Push stone1 from pos42 to pos41 (pushing leftward):
   - Check if player1 is at pos43: true.
   - Check if stone1 is at pos42: true.
   - Check if pos41 is clear: true.
   - Check if player1 can move from pos43 to pos42 following dirleft: true.
   - Check if stone1 can move from pos42 to pos41 following dirleft: true.
   - Check if pos41 is not a goal location: true.
   - All preconditions for pushtonongoal are met.
   - Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos42 pos41 dirleft
   - After action: player1 is at pos42, stone1 is at pos41, pos43 is clear.

3. Push stone1 from pos41 to pos51 (pushing downward):
   - Check if player1 is at pos42: true.
   - Check if stone1 is at pos41: true.
   - Check if pos51 is clear: true.
   - Check if player1 can move from pos42 to pos41 following dirleft: true.
   - Check if stone1 can move from pos41 to pos51 following dirdown: true.
   - Check if pos51 is a goal location: true.
   - All preconditions for pushtogoal are met.
   - Action: pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos41 pos51 dirdown
   - After action: player1 is at pos41, stone1 is at pos51, pos42 is clear, stone1 is at a goal state.

4. Move player1 from pos41 to pos31:
   - Check if player1 is at pos41: true.
   - Check if pos31 is clear: true.
   - Check if player1 can move from pos41 to pos31 following dirup: true.
   - All preconditions for move are met.
   - Action: move player1 pos41 pos31 dirup
   - After action: player1 is at pos31, pos41 is clear.

5. Move player1 from pos31 to pos32:
   - Check if player1 is at pos31: true.
   - Check if pos32 is clear: true.
   - Check if player1 can move from pos31 to pos32 following dirright: true.
   - All preconditions for move are met.
   - Action: move player1 pos31 pos32 dirright
   - After action: player1 is at pos32, pos31 is clear.
   (This satisfies the constraint that player1 must be at pos32 at some point.)

From the task's perspective, this seems like a valid plan that satisfies both the goal (stone1 is at a goal location, which is pos51) and the constraints (player1 is at pos32 at some point).

However, I think we've already achieved the core goal by step 3, since stone1 is at a goal location. Steps 4 and 5 are just to satisfy the constraint that player1 must be at pos32 at some point. Let me check the optimality of this plan.

Since the task is to ensure that "stone1 is at a goal location", and we achieve this in 3 steps, and we ensure that player1 is at pos32 (which is required for the constraints) in 5 steps, it seems like this is an optimal plan.

Let me ensure that all the preconditions are correct and the effects of each action matches our understanding:

1. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos43 pos42 dirleft:
   - Preconditions: player1 is at pos44, stone1 is at pos43, pos42 is clear, player1 can move from pos44 to pos43 following dirleft, stone1 can move from pos43 to pos42 following dirleft, pos42 is not a goal location.
   - Effects: player1 is at pos43, stone1 is at pos42, pos44 is clear.

2. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos42 pos41 dirleft:
   - Preconditions: player1 is at pos43, stone1 is at pos42, pos41 is clear, player1 can move from pos43 to pos42 following dirleft, stone1 can move from pos42 to pos41 following dirleft, pos41 is not a goal location.
   - Effects: player1 is at pos42, stone1 is at pos41, pos43 is clear.

3. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos41 pos51 dirdown:
   - Preconditions: player1 is at pos42, stone1 is at pos41, pos51 is clear, player1 can move from pos42 to pos41 following dirleft, stone1 can move from pos41 to pos51 following dirdown, pos51 is a goal location.
   - Effects: player1 is at pos41, stone1 is at pos51, pos42 is clear, stone1 is at a goal state.

4. move player1 pos41 pos31 dirup:
   - Preconditions: player1 is at pos41, pos31 is clear, player1 can move from pos41 to pos31 following dirup.
   - Effects: player1 is at pos31, pos41 is clear.

5. move player1 pos31 pos32 dirright:
   - Preconditions: player1 is at pos31, pos32 is clear, player1 can move from pos31 to pos32 following dirright.
   - Effects: player1 is at pos32, pos31 is clear.

Alright, I think the plan is valid and optimal:

1. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos43 pos42 dirleft
2. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos42 pos41 dirleft
3. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos41 pos51 dirdown
4. move player1 pos41 pos31 dirup
5. move player1 pos31 pos32 dirright

This solves the problem in 5 steps, which seems optimal given the constraints.
