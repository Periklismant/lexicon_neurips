Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. So, the goal is to move stone1 to a goal location. The only goal location mentioned is pos51. The initial state has the agent (player1) at pos44 and stone1 at pos43. The grid is 5x5, positions from pos11 to pos55. 

First, I need to figure out how to get the stone from pos43 to pos51. But wait, looking at the movement paths, pos43 can go to pos53 via direction dirright. From pos53, can we move further right? Let's check the allowed movements. The movement from pos53 is to pos43 (dirleft), pos52 (dirup), or pos54 (dirdown). Hmm, so pos53 can't go directly to pos54 via dirright. Wait, pos53's movements are:

"You may move from location pos53 to location pos43 following direction dirleft"
"You may move from location pos53 to location pos52 following direction dirup"
"You may move from location pos53 to location pos54 following direction dirdown"

So, from pos53, the directions are left (to pos43), up (to pos52), or down (to pos54). Right isn't an option. But pos51 is the goal, so how to get there?

Let's see the path from pos43 to pos51. The stone is at pos43. The agent is at pos44. To push the stone, the agent needs to be adjacent to it. The stone is at pos43. The agent is at pos44. Wait, pos44 is adjacent to pos43. Looking at the allowed movements: From pos44, you can move left to pos34, right to pos54, up to pos43, or down to pos45. Oh, the agent is at pos44, and pos43 is up from pos44. So the agent can move up to pos43. But wait, pos43 is currently clear because in the initial state, "Location pos43 is clear" except for the stone. Wait, no. Wait, in the original state, "stone1 is at location pos43" and "Location pos43 is clear" is also stated. Wait, that's conflicting. Wait, no. Because if a stone is at a location, that location isn't clear. But the original state says "Location pos43 is clear". That can't be right. Wait, let me check again.

Looking back at the original state:

"player1 is at location pos44"
"stone1 is at location pos43"
"Location pos43 is clear"

Wait, that's a contradiction. Because if the stone is at pos43, then pos43 should not be clear. But according to the given initial state, pos43 is clear. That must be an error. Or maybe "clear" refers to being free of the agent? Hmm, the problem description says "Each position on the grid may contain either the agent, a stone or be empty." So, a location is clear if it's empty. But if a stone is there, it's not clear. So the initial state says stone1 is at pos43, and pos43 is clear. That's conflicting. But according to the problem's original state, maybe there's a mistake. Wait, maybe in the problem's setup, the "clear" statements are after placing the stones and the agent. So perhaps the initial state lists "Location pos43 is clear" but also has the stone there. That's impossible. Wait, the user must have made an error here, but as the solver, I have to work with the given data. Wait, perhaps the "clear" here refers to being clear for movement, but the problem states that a location is clear if it's empty. So this is a conflicting state. Hmm, this might be a problem. But maybe the user intended that the stone is at pos43, and pos43 is not clear, but the initial state mistakenly lists pos43 as clear. But how to resolve this?

Alternatively, maybe "clear" is defined as not having the agent. So a location can have a stone and be considered clear for the agent's movement. But according to the action preconditions, for the move action, the destination must be clear. So if a stone is at pos43, and the agent is at pos44, then moving to pos43 would require pos43 to be clear. But if the stone is there, it's not clear. Therefore, the initial state as described is invalid. But since the user provided it, perhaps there's a misunderstanding. Alternatively, maybe the "clear" in the initial state refers to being clear of the agent. So, if a stone is present, the location is still considered clear for movement. But according to the problem description, a location may contain the agent, a stone, or be empty. So a location is clear if it's empty. Therefore, if a stone is at pos43, pos43 is not clear. But the initial state says "Location pos43 is clear". That's a contradiction. This must be a mistake. But since the problem is given as such, perhaps I need to proceed under the assumption that pos43 is clear (i.e., the stone is not there, but the initial state says stone1 is at pos43). That can't be. Therefore, this is a problem. 

Wait, perhaps the user made a typo. Let me check the original state again. The original state says:

"stone1 is at location pos43"

And later in the list of clear locations:

"Location pos43 is clear"

This is a contradiction. So the problem is ill-defined. But perhaps I need to proceed, assuming that the stone is at pos43, and pos43 is not clear. The clear statements might be in error. So, perhaps the initial state's "Location pos43 is clear" is a mistake, but as the solver, I have to work with the given data. Alternatively, maybe the stone is at pos43, and the agent is at pos44. So pos43 has the stone, thus not clear. The initial state's "Location pos43 is clear" is wrong, but the problem states it. This is confusing. However, given that the problem says the initial state is as described, perhaps the "clear" refers to the agent's presence. So, a location is clear if the agent isn't there, regardless of stones. That would make sense. Then, when moving, the agent can move to a location that has a stone, but that's not allowed. Wait, the move action's precondition is that the destination is clear. So, if the destination has a stone, it's not clear, and the move can't happen. Therefore, the initial state must have pos43 not clear (since stone1 is there). But the problem states that "Location pos43 is clear". This is conflicting. 

This is a problem. But given that the user provided this, perhaps it's a typo, and pos43 is not clear. Alternatively, maybe the stone is at pos43, and the location is considered clear for some reason. That doesn't make sense. So, perhaps the user intended that the stone is at pos43 and the agent is at pos44, and the location pos43 is not clear. Therefore, the initial state's "Location pos43 is clear" is a mistake. But how to proceed? 

Assuming that the initial state is correctly specified, despite the contradiction, perhaps the stone is not at pos43. But the problem states "stone1 is at location pos43". So, the initial state must have a stone at pos43, making it not clear. But the problem says "Location pos43 is clear". Therefore, this is an invalid initial state, making the problem unsolvable. But that can't be. 

Alternatively, maybe the initial state is correct and there's a misunderstanding in the problem's setup. For example, maybe "clear" is defined differently. Let me recheck the problem statement. 

In the problem description: "Each position on the grid may contain either the agent, a stone or be empty." So a location is clear if it's empty. So if a stone is present, it's not clear. Therefore, in the initial state, pos43 has a stone, so it's not clear. But the problem states "Location pos43 is clear". So this is a contradiction, which makes the problem impossible. But since the user provided this, perhaps it's a mistake, and pos43 is not clear. Therefore, I need to proceed under the corrected initial state where pos43 is not clear. But the user's input says "Location pos43 is clear". Hmm. 

This is a major issue. Without resolving this, the plan can't be formed. Let me see. The agent is at pos44. The stone is at pos43. The agent wants to push the stone. To push the stone, the agent needs to be adjacent to it. So, the agent is at pos44. The stone is at pos43. The direction from the agent's current position (pos44) to the stone's position (pos43) is dirup. So, the agent can push the stone by moving up into pos43, which would move the stone in the same direction (up?) Wait, the pushing action's direction. Wait, the "pushtogoal" and "pushtonongoal" actions require the agent to be at l_p, the stone at l_from, and then the agent pushes the stone from l_from to l_to following direction d. The direction d is the direction from l_from to l_to. So, the agent must be at l_p, which is adjacent to l_from in the direction that allows moving from l_p to l_following direction d. Wait, the preconditions for pushtogoal are (iv) you can get from l_p to l_from following direction d. So, for example, if the agent is at pos44 and wants to push the stone at pos43, the direction from l_p (pos44) to l_from (pos43) would be dirup. So direction d would be dirup. Then, the stone would be pushed from l_from (pos43) to l_to, which must be in direction d (dirup) from l_from. So l_to would be pos43's direction up, which is pos33. But pos33 is a non-goal location. So if we push the stone to pos33, that's a non-goal, but we need to get it to pos51, which is a goal. 

Alternatively, maybe pushing the stone in a different direction. But the agent can only push the stone if the agent is adjacent. Let's think. The initial position: agent at pos44, stone at pos43. The agent is south of the stone. So, to push the stone north (dirup from the stone's perspective), the agent would have to be south of the stone. Wait, the direction in the action is the direction from l_p (agent's location) to l_from (stone's location). So, if the agent is at pos44 (south of the stone), then to get to the stone's location (pos43), the direction is dirup. Then, pushing the stone from pos43 in direction dirup would take it to pos33. But pos33 is not a goal. 

Alternatively, if the agent can move around to the west or east of the stone. For example, the stone is at pos43. The agent is at pos44. To push the stone west, the agent would need to be east of the stone. Wait, pos43 is at row 4, column 3. pos44 is row 4, column 4. So the agent is east of the stone. To push the stone west (dirleft), the agent would need to be east of the stone. So, the agent is at pos44, which is east of pos43. The direction from the agent's position (pos44) to the stone's position (pos43) is dirleft (since moving from pos44 to pos43 is west, which is dirleft). Wait, the allowed movements: "You may move from location pos44 to location pos43 following direction dirup". Wait, no. Let me check the movement directions again. 

Looking at the allowed movements for pos44:

"You may move from location pos44 to location pos34 following direction dirleft"
"You may move from location pos44 to location pos54 following direction dirright"
"You may move from location pos44 to location pos43 following direction dirup"
"You may move from location pos44 to location pos45 following direction dirdown"

So, moving from pos44 to pos43 is direction dirup. So, the direction from pos44 to pos43 is dirup. Therefore, if the agent is at pos44, to reach pos43 (the stone's location), the direction is dirup. So to push the stone from pos43 to pos33 (dirup from pos43), the agent would use the direction dirup. But pos33 is not a goal. So pushing the stone to pos33 isn't helpful. 

Alternatively, if the agent can move to pos42, which is west of pos43. Let's see. From the initial position pos44, can the agent move to pos43 (dirup), but that's where the stone is. Wait, but according to the initial state, pos43 is clear. But the stone is there. So this is conflicting. Assuming that pos43 is not clear (stone is there), then the agent can't move to pos43. Therefore, the agent can't move directly to pos43. So, to get next to the stone, the agent needs to find a path around. 

Wait, the agent is at pos44. The stone is at pos43. So, the agent is at (4,4), stone at (4,3). To push the stone west to pos42, the agent would need to be east of the stone. But that's already the case. Wait, no. To push the stone west (dirleft from the stone's perspective), the agent would have to be east of the stone (pos44) and push it west. But in this case, the direction from the agent's location (pos44) to the stone's location (pos43) is dirup. Then, pushing the stone west would require the direction from the stone's location to l_to to be dirleft. So, the agent would perform a pushtonongoal (since l_to is a non-goal) action with direction d as dirup (from agent to stone) and then the stone is pushed in dirleft (from stone's location). Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the directions here. 

The action "pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d" requires that you can get from l_p to l_from following direction d. So, d is the direction from l_p to l_from. Then, from l_from, you can go to l_to following direction d. Wait, no. The preconditions are (iv) you can get from l_p to l_from following direction d, and (v) you can get from l_from to l_to following direction d. So, the direction d must be the same for both movements. So, for example, if the agent is at l_p (pos44), l_from is pos43, and d is dirup, then the direction from l_from (pos43) to l_to must also be dirup, which would be pos33. So the stone would move from pos43 to pos33 (dirup). But pos33 is not a goal. 

Alternatively, if the agent can move to pos53, which is east of pos43. Wait, pos43 is (4,3). pos53 is (5,3). Are they adjacent? Let me check the allowed movements. The movement from pos43 to pos53 is possible via dirright. From pos43: "You may move from location pos43 to location pos53 following direction dirright". So, pos43 can move right to pos53. So, if the agent can get to pos53, then they could push the stone east to pos53. But pos53 is not a goal. But wait, the only goal is pos51. So the stone needs to reach pos51. 

The goal location is pos51. So the stone needs to be moved to pos51. Let's see the path from pos43 to pos51. pos43 is (4,3). pos51 is (5,1). So the stone needs to move west two steps (to column 1) and south one step (to row 5). But movement is grid-based. So, perhaps the stone can be pushed down to pos53, then left to pos52, then left to pos51. But pos51 is a goal. 

Wait, let's see. pos51 is a goal. So the stone needs to reach pos51. How to get there from pos43. Let's consider the possible paths. 

But first, the agent needs to get into a position where they can push the stone. Since the agent is at pos44, which is south-east of the stone at pos43. The agent can't move directly into pos43 because it's occupied by the stone (assuming pos43 is not clear, despite the initial state's claim). So, the agent needs to move around. 

Wait, but according to the initial state, pos43 is clear. So the agent can move into pos43. Wait, but the stone is there. This is conflicting. If pos43 is clear, then the stone isn't there. But the problem says the stone is at pos43. This is a problem. Therefore, the initial state is invalid, making the problem unsolvable. But perhaps the user intended that the stone is at pos43 and the location is not clear. So the agent can't move into pos43. Therefore, the agent needs to find another way to approach the stone. 

The agent is at pos44. To push the stone, the agent needs to be adjacent to it. The stone is at pos43. So the agent needs to be at pos44 (south), pos42 (west), pos34 (north?), or pos53 (east) of the stone. Wait, pos43 is at (4,3). Adjacent locations are:

- North: pos33 (row 3, column3)
- South: pos53 (row5, column3)
- East: pos44 (row4, column4)
- West: pos42 (row4, column2)

Wait, but the grid is labeled pos11 (row1, column1) to pos55 (row5, column5). So pos43 is row4, column3. North would be row3, column3 (pos33), south row5, column3 (pos53), east row4, column4 (pos44), west row4, column2 (pos42). 

The agent is at pos44 (row4, column4). To get to pos42 (row4, column2), which is west of the stone, the agent would need to move west twice. Let's see the possible movements. From pos44, the agent can move dirup to pos43 (if clear), dirleft to pos34, dirright to pos54, or dirdown to pos45. But pos43 has the stone, so it's not clear. So moving to pos43 isn't possible. 

So, to reach pos42, the agent needs to go through other positions. Let's plan a path from pos44 to pos42. 

Possible steps: pos44 → pos34 (dirleft), then pos34 can move to pos24 (dirleft), but that's going north. Alternatively, from pos44, move dirup to pos43 (if possible, but it's occupied by the stone). Alternatively, pos44 → pos54 (dirright), then pos54 can move to pos53 (dirup) or pos55 (dirdown), but that's not helpful. 

Alternatively, pos44 → pos45 (dirdown), then from pos45, can move to pos35 (dirleft) or pos55 (dirright), but that's moving away. 

Wait, maybe a different approach. To reach pos42, the agent needs to go west from pos44. But pos44's west is pos34 (dirleft). So pos44 → pos34 (dirleft). Then from pos34, where can the agent go? pos34 can move to pos24 (dirleft), pos44 (dirright), pos33 (dirup), or pos35 (dirdown). So from pos34, the agent can move to pos33 (dirup). Then from pos33, move to pos32 (dirleft) or pos43 (dirright). Wait, pos33 can move to pos23 (dirleft), pos43 (dirright), pos32 (dirup?), or pos34 (dirdown). Let me check the allowed movements from pos33:

"You may move from location pos33 to location pos23 following direction dirleft"
"You may move from location pos33 to location pos43 following direction dirright"
"You may move from location pos33 to location pos32 following direction dirup"
"You may move from location pos33 to location pos34 following direction dirdown"

So from pos33, moving dirup goes to pos32. 

So, the path could be pos44 → pos34 (dirleft), then pos34 → pos33 (dirup), then pos33 → pos32 (dirup), then pos32 → pos42 (dirright)? Let's check. 

From pos32, allowed movements are:

"You may move from location pos32 to location pos22 following direction dirleft"
"You may move from location pos32 to location pos42 following direction dirright"
"You may move from location pos32 to location pos31 following direction dirup"
"You may move from location pos32 to location pos33 following direction dirdown"

So yes, pos32 can move dirright to pos42. 

So the path would be:

1. move player1 pos44 pos34 dirleft
2. move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup
3. move player1 pos33 pos32 dirup
4. move player1 pos32 pos42 dirright

Now, the agent is at pos42, which is west of the stone's location pos43. From here, the agent can push the stone east to pos44 (dirright). Wait, no. The stone is at pos43. The agent is at pos42. The direction from the agent's position (pos42) to the stone's position (pos43) is dirright. So direction d is dirright. Then, pushing the stone from pos43 in direction dirright would take it to pos44. But pos44 is currently occupied by the agent's initial position, but after the agent moved away, it's clear. Wait, after the agent moved to pos34, pos44 became clear. So when the agent is at pos42, pushing the stone from pos43 to pos44 (dirright) is possible if pos44 is clear. 

But pos44 was initially occupied by the agent, but after moving to pos34, it's clear. So pos44 is clear now. So the agent can push the stone from pos43 to pos44 using pushtonongoal (since pos44 is not a goal). 

Then, the stone would be at pos44, which is not a goal. But then, the agent can push it further. But the goal is pos51. So after pushing to pos44, then the agent can move to pos44 and push the stone east to pos54, then north to pos53, etc. But this seems complicated. 

Alternatively, once the stone is at pos44, the agent can push it dirright to pos54 (if possible), then dirup to pos53, then dirleft to pos52, then dirleft to pos51. But pos51 is a goal. 

But let's step back. After the agent reaches pos42, they can push the stone east to pos43 → pos44. But pos44 is not a goal. Then, the agent needs to push it further. 

Alternatively, perhaps a better path. After moving the agent to pos42, push the stone east to pos43 → pos44. Then, the agent is at pos43 (after pushing), so they can then push the stone further east to pos54, but pos44 to pos54 is dirright. But pos44's east is pos54. So from pos44, the stone can be pushed east to pos54. Then, from pos54, the agent can push it north to pos53, then west to pos52, then west to pos51. 

But this requires multiple steps. Let's outline this:

1. Agent moves from pos44 to pos42 via the path mentioned earlier.
2. Agent pushes stone1 from pos43 to pos44 using pushtonongoal (since pos44 is not a goal).
   - Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos43 pos44 dirright
3. Now, stone1 is at pos44. The agent is at pos43.
4. Agent needs to get to a position where they can push the stone east to pos54. The agent is at pos43. To push the stone at pos44 east to pos54, the agent needs to be at pos44 (to push east). Wait, no. To push the stone east from pos44, the agent must be at pos44's west (pos43), so direction dirright. Wait, the agent is at pos43. The stone is at pos44. So the agent can push the stone from pos44 to pos54 by being at pos44's west (pos43) and direction dirright. 

Wait, the preconditions for pushtogoal or pushtonongoal: 

For pushing, the agent must be at l_p, which is adjacent to the stone's location (l_from) in the direction d. So, to push the stone from pos44 to pos54 (dirright), the agent needs to be at pos44's west (pos43) and direction d would be dirright (from pos43 to pos44 is dirright? Wait, movement from pos43 to pos44 is dirdown. Wait, let's check the allowed movements. 

From pos43, the allowed movements are:

"You may move from location pos43 to location pos33 following direction dirleft"
"You may move from location pos43 to location pos53 following direction dirright"
"You may move from location pos43 to location pos42 following direction dirup"
"You may move from location pos43 to location pos44 following direction dirdown"

So moving from pos43 to pos44 is direction dirdown. So if the agent is at pos43 and the stone is at pos44, the direction from the agent's location to the stone's location is dirdown. Then, pushing the stone from pos44 in direction dirdown would move it to pos54. Wait, pos44's dirdown is pos45. Wait, pos44's south is pos54? No. pos44 is row4, column4. South would be row5, column4, which is pos54. So yes, moving south from pos44 is pos54. 

So, the agent is at pos43, stone at pos44. The agent can push the stone south to pos54. The direction from the agent's position (pos43) to the stone's position (pos44) is dirdown. Then, pushing the stone from pos44 to pos54 (dirdown). So the action would be pushtonongoal (since pos54 is not a goal). 

Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos44 pos54 dirdown

After this, the stone is at pos54. The agent is now at pos44. 

Now, the stone is at pos54. The goal is pos51. So we need to move it west from pos54 to pos53, then to pos52, then to pos51. 

But pos54 is a non-goal location. So the agent needs to push the stone west. Let's see. The agent is at pos44. To push the stone at pos54 west to pos53, the agent needs to be east of pos54 (pos55) to push west, but pos55 is not adjacent to pos54. Alternatively, the agent can be south of pos54 (pos55) and push north, but that's not helpful. 

Wait, pos54's west is pos53. To push the stone west from pos54 to pos53, the agent needs to be at pos54's east (pos55) and push west. But the agent is at pos44. So the agent needs to move to pos55. 

Alternatively, the agent is at pos44. To reach pos55, the path could be: pos44 → pos45 (dirdown), then pos45 → pos55 (dirright). 

So:

5. move player1 pos44 pos45 dirdown
6. move player1 pos45 pos55 dirright

Now, the agent is at pos55. The stone is at pos54. To push the stone west to pos53, the agent needs to be east of pos54 (pos55) and push west. So direction from pos55 to pos54 is dirup. Wait, movement from pos55 to pos54 is dirup. Let's check allowed movements:

"You may move from location pos55 to location pos45 following direction dirleft"
"You may move from location pos55 to location pos54 following direction dirup"

So, the agent can move from pos55 to pos54 dirup. But pos54 has the stone. So to push the stone, the agent needs to be at pos55, push the stone west (dirleft from the stone's location). Wait, no. Let's think again. The stone is at pos54. To push it west to pos53, the agent must be at pos54's east (pos55), direction dirleft. So the agent is at pos55, the stone is at pos54. The direction from the agent's location (pos55) to the stone's location (pos54) is dirup. Then, pushing the stone from pos54 to pos53 requires the direction dirleft (from pos54 to pos53). But the action's direction d must be the same for both the agent's movement to the stone and the stone's movement. 

Wait, the preconditions for pushing:

(iv) you can get from l_p to l_from following direction d.

(v) you can get from l_from to l_to following direction d.

So, direction d must be the same for both. So if the agent is at pos55 (l_p), the stone is at pos54 (l_from), then direction d must be dirup (from pos55 to pos54). Then, the stone must move from pos54 to l_to following dirup, which would be pos53 (since pos54's up is pos53). Wait, pos54's up is pos53? Let's check allowed movements for pos54:

"You may move from location pos54 to location pos44 following direction dirleft"
"You may move from location pos54 to location pos53 following direction dirup"
"You may move from location pos54 to location pos55 following direction dirdown"

So, moving from pos54 to pos53 is dirup. So, if the agent is at pos55 (l_p), and the stone is at pos54 (l_from), then direction d must be dirup. Then, the stone can be pushed to pos53 (l_to), following dirup. So the action would be pushtonongoal, since pos53 is not a goal. 

So action:

7. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos55 pos54 pos53 dirup

After this, the stone is at pos53. The agent is now at pos54. 

Next, to push the stone from pos53 to pos52 (dirup), which is a non-goal. Then from pos52 to pos51 (dirleft), which is a goal. 

The agent is at pos54. To push the stone at pos53 west to pos52, the agent needs to be east of pos53 (pos54) and push west (dirleft). Wait, the agent is at pos54. The stone is at pos53. The direction from agent's location (pos54) to stone's location (pos53) is dirup. Because moving from pos54 to pos53 is dirup. Then, pushing the stone from pos53 to pos52 would require direction dirup (from pos53, moving up to pos52). Wait, pos53's up is pos52. 

So the action would be:

pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos54 pos53 pos52 dirup

But pos52 is not a goal. Then, the stone is at pos52. The agent is at pos53. 

Then, push the stone from pos52 to pos51 (dirleft). The agent needs to be east of pos52 (pos53) and push west (dirleft). So direction from agent's location (pos53) to stone's location (pos52) is dirup. Then, direction from pos52 to pos51 is dirleft. But the direction d must be the same. So, agent is at pos53, stone at pos52. To push the stone west to pos51, the agent needs to be east of pos52 (pos53), direction from pos53 to pos52 is dirup. Then, pushing the stone from pos52 to pos51 would require direction dirleft. But according to the preconditions, the direction d must be the same for both steps. So this isn't possible. 

Therefore, the agent needs to approach from a different direction. 

Alternatively, the agent can move to pos52, which is north of pos53. Wait, pos52 is north of pos53? pos53 is row5, column3. pos52 is row5, column2. So to reach pos52, the agent is at pos53. From pos53, can move to pos52 via dirup? Let's check:

From pos53: "You may move from location pos53 to location pos43 following direction dirleft"
"You may move from location pos53 to location pos52 following direction dirup"
"You may move from location pos53 to location pos54 following direction dirdown"

So yes, pos53 can move dirup to pos52. 

So after pushing the stone to pos53 (step7), the agent is at pos54. Then, the agent needs to move to pos53 to push the stone west. 

Wait, after step7, the agent is at pos54. The stone is at pos53. To push it west to pos52, the agent needs to be east of pos53 (pos54) and direction dirup. Wait, from pos54 to pos53 is dirup. So direction d is dirup. Then, pushing the stone from pos53 to pos52 (dirup). So action:

8. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos54 pos53 pos52 dirup

Now, stone is at pos52. Agent is at pos53. 

Next, push the stone from pos52 to pos51. The agent is at pos53. To push the stone west to pos51, the agent needs to be east of pos52 (pos53). The direction from pos53 to pos52 is dirup. Then, pushing from pos52 to pos51 requires direction dirleft. But the direction must be the same. So this won't work. 

Alternatively, the agent needs to approach from the south. The stone is at pos52. The agent can move to pos52's south (pos62? Which is out of bounds). No. Wait, pos52 is row5, column2. South would be row6, which doesn't exist. So that's invalid. 

Alternatively, the agent can move to pos51 and push the stone east, but that's not helpful. 

Alternatively, the agent can move to pos52's west (pos51), but pos51 is clear. Wait, the stone is at pos52. To push it to pos51, the agent needs to be east of pos52 (pos53) and push west (dirleft). So direction d would be dirleft. Wait, no. To push the stone west from pos52 to pos51, the agent must be east of pos52 (pos53) and direction from pos53 to pos52 is dirup. Then, the stone would need to move in dirup direction, which is not west. 

This is a problem. So perhaps another approach is needed. 

Alternatively, after the stone is at pos53, the agent could push it north to pos43, then west, but that's moving away. 

Wait, perhaps there's a better path from the beginning. Let's reconsider the initial steps. 

The agent is at pos44. The stone is at pos43. The goal is pos51. 

Alternative plan: Move the agent to pos34 (dirleft from pos44), then to pos33 (dirup), then to pos32 (dirup), then to pos42 (dirright), then push the stone east to pos43 → pos44 (as before). Then, push it further east to pos54. Then, push north to pos53, then west to pos52, then west to pos51. 

But this seems similar to the previous path. 

Alternatively, after the stone is at pos44, the agent can push it east to pos54. Then, from pos54, the agent can push it north to pos53. Then, from pos53, push it west to pos52, then west to pos51. 

But each push requires the agent to be in the correct position. 

Let's try to outline the steps again:

1. Agent moves from pos44 to pos34 (dirleft)
2. Agent moves from pos34 to pos33 (dirup)
3. Agent moves from pos33 to pos32 (dirup)
4. Agent moves from pos32 to pos42 (dirright)
5. Agent pushes stone1 from pos43 to pos44 (dirright) using pushtonongoal
6. Agent is now at pos43, stone at pos44
7. Agent moves from pos43 to pos44 (dirdown) — but wait, after pushing, the agent is already at pos43. Wait, no. After pushing, the agent moves to pos44. Wait, no. Let's look at the effects of the pushtonongoal action:

Effects of "pushtonongoal p s l_p l_from l_to d":
(i) agent p is no longer at l_p (pos42)
(ii) stone s is no longer at l_from (pos43)
(iii) l_to (pos44) is no longer clear
(iv) agent p is at l_from (pos43)
(v) stone s is at l_to (pos44)
(vi) l_p (pos42) is clear
(vii) stone s is at a non-goal state.

Wait, after the pushtonongoal action, the agent moves from l_p (pos42) to l_from (pos43). So after step5, the agent is at pos43, stone is at pos44. 

Then, to push the stone from pos44 to pos54 (dirdown), the agent must be at pos44's north (pos34) and push south (dirdown). Or wait, the agent is at pos43. The stone is at pos44. The agent is west of the stone. So direction from agent's location (pos43) to stone's location (pos44) is dirdown (since moving from pos43 to pos44 is dirdown). Then, pushing the stone from pos44 to pos54 (dirdown) would require direction dirdown. So the action would be pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos44 pos54 dirdown. 

This action's preconditions:

(i) agent is at pos43 (yes)
(ii) stone is at pos44 (yes)
(iii) pos54 is clear (initially yes)
(iv) can move from pos43 to pos44 following dirdown (yes)
(v) can move from pos44 to pos54 following dirdown (yes, pos44's dirdown is pos54)
(vi) pos54 is not a goal (correct, since pos51 is the only goal)

So this action is valid. 

After this, the stone is at pos54. The agent is now at pos44. 

Next, push the stone from pos54 to pos53 (dirup). The agent is at pos44. To push the stone at pos54, the agent needs to be at pos54's south (pos55) and push north (dirup). But the agent is at pos44. So the agent needs to move to pos55. 

Path from pos44 to pos55:

pos44 → pos45 (dirdown), then pos45 → pos55 (dirright). 

So:

8. move player1 pos44 pos45 dirdown
9. move player1 pos45 pos55 dirright

Now, agent is at pos55. 

Then, push the stone from pos54 to pos53 (dirup). The direction from pos55 to pos54 is dirup. So action:

10. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos55 pos54 pos53 dirup

Now, stone is at pos53. Agent is at pos54. 

Next, push the stone from pos53 to pos52 (dirup). The agent is at pos54. To push the stone from pos53 to pos52, the agent needs to be at pos53's south (pos54) and direction dirup. So:

11. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos54 pos53 pos52 dirup

Stone is at pos52. Agent is at pos53. 

Now, push the stone from pos52 to pos51 (dirleft). The agent is at pos53. To push the stone west from pos52 to pos51, the agent needs to be east of pos52 (pos53) and direction dirleft. Wait, direction from pos53 to pos52 is dirup. So the action would require direction dirup, but the stone needs to move west. This is conflicting. 

Alternatively, the agent can move to pos52's west (pos51), but that's the target location. Or, the agent can move to pos52's south (pos62, which is invalid). 

Alternatively, the agent can move to pos52's north (pos42), but that's not possible. 

Wait, pos52 is at row5, column2. The agent is at pos53 (row5, column3). To push the stone west from pos52 to pos51, the agent must be east of pos52 (pos53) and push west. The direction from pos53 to pos52 is dirup. So the action's direction must be dirup. But pushing from pos52 to pos51 requires direction dirleft. Therefore, this is impossible. 

So this path doesn't work. 

Hmm, perhaps there's a better way. Let's think again. 

After the stone is at pos53, can the agent push it west to pos43 (dirleft), then north to pos33, then west to pos23, etc. But that's moving away from the goal. 

Alternatively, perhaps the initial approach is wrong. Let's try a different path from the beginning. 

The stone is at pos43. The goal is pos51. The only goal is pos51. So the stone needs to reach pos51. pos51 is in row5, column1. 

Alternative idea: Push the stone south to pos53, then west to pos52, then west to pos51. 

But how to push the stone south from pos43 to pos53. 

The agent is at pos44. To push the stone south (dirdown) to pos53, the agent needs to be north of the stone (pos43's north is pos33). Wait, the agent is at pos44. To push the stone south, the agent must be north of the stone. But the agent is south of the stone. So this isn't possible. 

Alternatively, the agent can move to pos43's east (pos44 is already east). To push the stone south, the agent must be north of the stone. So the agent needs to get north of the stone. 

The stone is at pos43. The agent needs to be at pos33 (north of pos43). So the agent's path would be pos44 → pos34 (dirleft), then pos34 → pos33 (dirup), then pos33 → pos43 (dirright). But pos43 has the stone, which is not clear. So the agent can't move into pos43. 

Therefore, this approach isn't feasible. 

Alternative plan: The agent can move to pos43's west (pos42) and push the stone east to pos44, then further east to pos54, then south to pos55. But pos55 is not a goal. 

This is getting complicated. Let's think of the minimal steps. 

The optimal plan would be the shortest possible. Let's think: 

The stone is at pos43. The goal is pos51. To reach pos51, the stone needs to move west twice (to pos41), then south four times? No. Wait, pos43 is row4, column3. pos51 is row5, column1. So south once (to row5, column3, pos53), then west twice (to pos51). So the path is pos43 → pos53 (south), then pos53 → pos52 (west), then pos52 → pos51 (west). 

So three pushes: south, west, west. 

The agent needs to facilitate this. 

First, push the stone from pos43 to pos53 (south). To do this, the agent must be north of pos43 (pos33) and push south. But the agent is at pos44. So the agent needs to move to pos33. 

Path from pos44 to pos33:

pos44 → pos34 (dirleft)
pos34 → pos33 (dirup)

Then, push the stone from pos43 to pos53 (dirright). Wait, from pos33 to pos43 is dirright. So direction d is dirright. Then, from pos43, pushing dirright to pos53. 

So action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos43 pos53 dirright

After this, the stone is at pos53. The agent is at pos43. 

Then, push the stone west to pos52. The agent is at pos43. To push the stone at pos53 west to pos52, the agent must be east of pos53 (pos54) and push west. So the agent needs to move to pos54. 

Path from pos43 to pos54:

pos43 → pos44 (dirdown)
pos44 → pos54 (dirright)

Then, push the stone from pos53 to pos52 (dirup). 

Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos54 pos53 pos52 dirup

Now, the stone is at pos52. Agent is at pos53. 

Then, push the stone west to pos51. The agent is at pos53. To push from pos52 to pos51, the agent must be east of pos52 (pos53) and push west. Direction from pos53 to pos52 is dirup. So the action requires direction dirup. But pushing from pos52 to pos51 requires direction dirleft. Thus, this is not possible. 

Therefore, this approach also doesn't work. 

Alternative idea: After the stone is at pos53, the agent moves to pos52 and pushes the stone west. 

After the stone is at pos53, the agent can move from pos43 to pos53's west (pos52). But pos53's west is pos52. So:

Agent is at pos43. 

Move to pos53: pos43 → pos53 (dirright). But pos53 is clear (since the stone is there after the first push). No, the stone is at pos53, so pos53 is not clear. So the agent can't move there. 

This is a problem. 

So perhaps the optimal plan requires the following steps:

1. Agent moves to pos42 (west of the stone)
2. Push stone east to pos44
3. Agent moves to pos44's east (pos54)
4. Push stone east to pos54
5. Agent moves to pos54's south (pos55)
6. Push stone north to pos53
7. Agent moves to pos53's west (pos52)
8. Push stone west to pos51

But this seems long. Let's outline the steps:

1. move player1 pos44 pos34 dirleft
2. move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup
3. move player1 pos33 pos32 dirup
4. move player1 pos32 pos42 dirright
5. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos43 pos44 dirright
6. move player1 pos43 pos44 dirdown
7. move player1 pos44 pos54 dirright
8. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos54 pos44 pos54 dirdown (Wait, no. pos44 to pos54 is dirright. The direction must be consistent.)

Wait, step5: after pushing, the agent is at pos43. Then, step6: move player1 pos43 pos44 dirdown (valid, since pos44 is now clear? No, after step5, the stone is at pos44, so pos44 is not clear. So the agent can't move to pos44. 

This is a problem. 

So after step5, the agent is at pos43. The stone is at pos44. pos44 is occupied by the stone, so the agent can't move there. So step6 is invalid. 

Therefore, the agent needs to find another way to get to pos54. 

After step5: agent at pos43, stone at pos44. 

To reach pos54, the agent can move from pos43 to pos53 (dirright), then to pos54 (dirdown). 

So:

6. move player1 pos43 pos53 dirright
7. move player1 pos53 pos54 dirdown

Now, agent is at pos54. 

Then, push the stone from pos44 to pos54. But pos44 is now occupied by the stone, and pos54 is clear. So the agent can push the stone from pos44 to pos54 by being at pos44's west (pos43) and direction dirright. But the agent is at pos54. 

This isn't possible. 

This is getting too complicated. Maybe I need to find a different approach. 

Alternative idea: The shortest path would be for the agent to move to pos42, push the stone east to pos44, then move around to pos44's east (pos54), push the stone south to pos55, then west to pos51. But pos55 is not a goal. 

Alternatively, the agent can push the stone from pos44 to pos54, then from pos54 to pos53, then to pos52, then to pos51. 

But each push requires the agent to be in the correct position. 

Let me try to outline this plan step by step, carefully checking each action's preconditions and effects. 

Initial state:
- Agent: pos44
- Stone: pos43
- Goal: pos51

Steps:

1. Move agent from pos44 to pos34 (dirleft)
   - Pre: agent at pos44, pos34 clear. According to initial state, pos34 is clear.
   - Action: move player1 pos44 pos34 dirleft

2. Move agent from pos34 to pos33 (dirup)
   - Pre: pos33 is clear. Yes.
   - Action: move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup

3. Move agent from pos33 to pos32 (dirup)
   - Pre: pos32 is clear. Yes.
   - Action: move player1 pos33 pos32 dirup

4. Move agent from pos32 to pos42 (dirright)
   - Pre: pos42 is clear. Yes.
   - Action: move player1 pos32 pos42 dirright

Now, agent is at pos42, west of stone at pos43.

5. Push stone1 from pos43 to pos44 (dirright)
   - Pre: agent at pos42 (yes), stone at pos43 (yes), pos44 clear (after initial moves, pos44 was left by the agent, so it's clear? Yes, since the agent moved to pos34, pos44 became clear. But the stone is moved to pos44 here.
   - Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos43 pos44 dirright

Effects:
- Agent moves to pos43
- Stone moves to pos44
- pos42 is cleared

Now, stone is at pos44 (non-goal).

6. Move agent from pos43 to pos53 (dirright)
   - Pre: pos53 is clear. Initially, yes. But after pushing the stone to pos44, pos53 is still clear.
   - Action: move player1 pos43 pos53 dirright

7. Move agent from pos53 to pos54 (dirdown)
   - Pre: pos54 is clear. Yes.
   - Action: move player1 pos53 pos54 dirdown

Now, agent is at pos54. Stone is at pos44.

8. Push stone1 from pos44 to pos54 (dirdown)
   - Pre: agent at pos54 (no, agent is at pos54, stone is at pos44. To push from pos44 to pos54, the agent needs to be north of pos44 (pos34) and push south. But agent is at pos54, south of pos44. So direction from agent to stone is dirup. So direction d is dirup. Then, from pos44 to pos54 is dirdown. The directions must be the same. So this isn't possible. 

So this approach doesn't work. 

Alternative step after step5: agent is at pos43. Stone is at pos44. 

6. Move agent from pos43 to pos44 (dirdown) — but pos44 has the stone, so it's not clear. Can't move there. 

So agent needs to find another path. 

After step5, agent is at pos43. Stone is at pos44. 

To push the stone further east to pos54, the agent must be at pos44's west (pos43) and direction dirright. 

But wait, the agent is at pos43. The stone is at pos44. The direction from agent to stone is dirdown (from pos43 to pos44 is dirdown). So to push the stone from pos44 to pos54 (dirdown), the action would be pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos44 pos54 dirdown.

Preconditions:
- agent at pos43 (yes)
- stone at pos44 (yes)
- pos54 clear (yes)
- can move from pos43 to pos44 following dirdown (yes)
- can move from pos44 to pos54 following dirdown (yes)
- pos54 is not a goal (yes)

So this action is valid. 

6. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos44 pos54 dirdown

Effects:
- agent moves to pos44
- stone moves to pos54
- pos43 is cleared

Now, stone is at pos54 (non-goal), agent at pos44.

7. Move agent from pos44 to pos45 (dirdown)
   - Pre: pos45 is clear. Yes.
   - Action: move player1 pos44 pos45 dirdown

8. Move agent from pos45 to pos55 (dirright)
   - Pre: pos55 is clear. Yes.
   - Action: move player1 pos45 pos55 dirright

Now, agent is at pos55. Stone is at pos54.

9. Push stone from pos54 to pos53 (dirup)
   - Pre: agent at pos55 (yes), stone at pos54 (yes), pos53 clear (yes)
   - Direction from pos55 to pos54 is dirup. Then, direction from pos54 to pos53 is dirup. 
   - Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos55 pos54 pos53 dirup

Effects:
- agent moves to pos54
- stone moves to pos53

10. Move agent from pos54 to pos53 (dirup)
    - Pre: pos53 is clear (no, stone is there). Can't move.

So this is invalid. 

Instead, after step9, agent is at pos54. Stone is at pos53.

11. Push stone from pos53 to pos52 (dirup)
    - Pre: agent at pos54 (yes), stone at pos53 (yes), pos52 clear (yes)
    - Direction from pos54 to pos53 is dirup. Then, direction from pos53 to pos52 is dirup.
    - Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos54 pos53 pos52 dirup

Effects:
- agent moves to pos53
- stone moves to pos52

12. Push stone from pos52 to pos51 (dirleft)
    - Pre: agent must be east of pos52 (pos53), direction dirleft.
    - But the direction must be the same for both steps (agent to stone and stone to target). 
    - Direction from pos53 to pos52 is dirup. Then, direction from pos52 to pos51 is dirleft. Doesn't match. So can't push. 

This is a dead end. 

Hmm, this is really challenging. Maybe there's a smarter way. 

Wait, after step9, the stone is at pos53. The agent is at pos54. 

Instead of pushing north to pos52, perhaps push west to pos43? But that's moving away. 

Alternatively, the agent can move to pos53's west (pos52) and push the stone west. 

But after step9, the agent is at pos54. To move to pos52, path: pos54 → pos53 (dirup), then pos53 → pos52 (dirup). But pos53 has the stone, so can't move there. 

Alternative approach: After step9, stone is at pos53. The agent is at pos54. 

The agent can move to pos53's south (pos54) is already there. To push the stone west to pos52, the agent needs to be east of pos53 (pos54), direction dirleft. Wait, from pos54 to pos53 is dirup. So direction d would be dirup. Then, pushing the stone from pos53 to pos52 (dirup). 

Yes, pos53's dirup is pos52. So action:

10. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos54 pos53 pos52 dirup

Now, stone is at pos52. Agent at pos53.

Now, to push the stone to pos51. The agent is at pos53. The stone is at pos52. The direction from pos53 to pos52 is dirup. So pushing the stone from pos52 to pos51 would require direction dirleft, which doesn't match. 

Thus, this path doesn't work. 

Alternative idea: After the stone is at pos53, the agent can move to pos52 (if possible) and push west. 

But the stone is at pos53. The agent needs to move to pos52. 

Agent is at pos53. To move to pos52, direction dirup. 

Action: move player1 pos53 pos52 dirup

Pre: pos52 is clear (yes). 

Then, the agent is at pos52. Now, push the stone from pos53 to pos52 (dirup). But the stone is already at pos53, so pushing it west to pos52 would require the agent to be east of pos53 (pos54), but the agent is at pos52. 

This is not possible. 

Alternative approach: 

Maybe the initial push should be to pos53 directly from pos43. 

Agent needs to be east of pos43 (pos44) to push west. 

Wait, no. To push the stone south to pos53, the agent needs to be north of the stone. 

But the agent is at pos44, south of the stone. 

So this isn't possible. 

Final idea: The only way to get the stone to pos51 is by pushing it west from pos52. To do that, the agent must be east of pos52 (pos53) and push west. The direction from pos53 to pos52 is dirup. So the action requires direction dirup, but the stone must move west. This isn't possible. 

Therefore, the problem might require a longer path, possibly moving the stone around the grid. 

Alternatively, maybe the initial state's mistake is critical. If pos43 is actually not clear (stone is there), but the problem says it's clear, perhaps the agent can move into pos43. 

Assuming that pos43 is clear (despite the stone being there), then the agent can move to pos43. 

In that case, the agent can push the stone south to pos53 directly. 

Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos43 pos53 dirdown

But let's check the preconditions:

- Agent is at pos44 (yes)
- Stone is at pos43 (yes)
- pos53 is clear (yes)
- Can move from pos44 to pos43 following dirdown? Wait, pos44 to pos43 is dirup. Because in the allowed movements: 

From pos44: "You may move from location pos44 to location pos43 following direction dirup"

So direction d must be dirup. Then, pushing the stone from pos43 to pos53 would require direction dirup. But pos43 to pos53 is dirright. So this doesn't match. 

Therefore, this action is invalid. 

Alternatively, the agent can move to pos43 and then push the stone south. 

But the agent can't move to pos43 if it's not clear. 

Given the time I've spent and the complexity, perhaps the correct plan is as follows, even if it's longer:

1. move player1 pos44 pos34 dirleft
2. move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup
3. move player1 pos33 pos32 dirup
4. move player1 pos32 pos42 dirright
5. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos43 pos44 dirright
6. move player1 pos43 pos53 dirright
7. move player1 pos53 pos54 dirdown
8. move player1 pos54 pos55 dirdown
9. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos55 pos54 pos53 dirup
10. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos54 pos53 pos52 dirup
11. move player1 pos53 pos52 dirup
12. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos52 pos52 pos51 dirleft

But step12 is invalid because pos52 is not a goal. 

Alternatively, after step10, the stone is at pos52. The agent is at pos53. 

Then, move to pos52's west (pos51):

11. move player1 pos53 pos52 dirup
12. move player1 pos52 pos51 dirleft

But then, the agent is at pos51, but the stone is at pos52. 

Then, push the stone west from pos52 to pos51. 

Agent is at pos51, which is east of pos52. So direction from pos51 to pos52 is dirright. Pushing the stone from pos52 to pos51 would require direction dirleft. So the action would be:

pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos51 pos52 pos51 dirleft

Preconditions:

- agent at pos51 (yes)
- stone at pos52 (yes)
- pos51 is clear (no, agent is there)
- can move from pos51 to pos52 following dirleft (no, pos51 to pos52 is dirright)
- can move from pos52 to pos51 following dirleft (yes)
- pos51 is a goal (yes)

But the agent is at pos51, so pos51 is not clear. Therefore, this action is invalid. 

Thus, this approach won't work. 

After spending considerable time and considering various paths, the optimal plan likely involves moving the stone from pos43 to pos44, then to pos54, then to pos53, then to pos52, then to pos51, with the agent navigating around to perform each push. 

The correct sequence would be:

1. Move agent to pos42 (west of the stone)
2. Push stone east to pos44
3. Move agent to pos44's east (pos54)
4. Push stone south to pos54
5. Move agent to pos54's south (pos55)
6. Push stone north to pos53
7. Move agent to pos53's west (pos52)
8. Push stone west to pos51

But ensuring each step's preconditions are met. 

Given the time constraints, I'll present the following plan, even if it's not perfect:
