Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. The goal is to get stone1 to a goal location, which is pos51. The constraints are that at some point the player must be at pos32, and if they are, then either pos44 wasn't clear or stone1 was at pos32 before.

Starting state: The agent (player1) is at pos44. Stone1 is at pos43. Pos51 is the only goal location. All other locations are non-goal. The agent needs to move the stone to pos51.

First, check the movement paths. To push the stone to pos51, we need to get it there. Since the agent can push stones, let's see the possible directions. The stone is at pos43. From there, possible directions? Let's look at the movement allowed.

Looking at pos43's connections: The agent can move from pos43 to pos33 (dirleft), pos53 (dirright), pos42 (dirup), or pos44 (dirdown). But the agent starts at pos44. So initially, pos44 is clear? Wait, the original state says "Location pos44 is clear" but "player1 is at location pos44". Wait, no, the initial state says "player1 is at pos44", so pos44 is not clear. But in the "original state of the world" section, it lists "Location pos44 is clear" but also "player1 is at pos44". That might be a contradiction. Wait, let me check again.

Wait, the original state says "player1 is at location pos44" and "Location pos44 is clear". That can't be right. Because if the player is there, the location isn't clear. But according to the problem statement, maybe the "clear" status is separate from the agent and stones. Wait, no. The effects of the move action, for example, state that after moving, the l_from becomes clear and l_to is not. So "clear" means that neither the agent nor a stone is there. So the initial state says pos44 is clear, but the player is there. That's conflicting. Wait, maybe there's a mistake in the problem description.

Wait, the original state includes:

- "player1 is at location pos44"

- "stone1 is at location pos43"

- "Location pos43 is clear"

Wait, but if stone1 is at pos43, then pos43 should not be clear. But the original state says "Location pos43 is clear". That's a contradiction. Hmm. Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem. But according to the user's input, the original state lists:

"Location pos43 is clear" but also "stone1 is at location pos43". That's impossible. Unless "clear" refers to something else. Wait, maybe "clear" means that the location is free for movement, but in the problem's context, the presence of the agent or a stone makes it not clear. So in the initial state, pos44 is clear but the player is there? That seems wrong. Maybe there's a mistake in the problem's initial state.

Wait, perhaps I misread. Let me check again the original state:

Original state:

- "player1 is at location pos44"

- "stone1 is at location pos43"

Then the list of clear locations includes pos43 and pos44. Wait, no. Let me check:

The original state lists:

"Location pos11 is clear"

...

"Location pos43 is clear"

"Location pos44 is clear"

But if the player is at pos44 and the stone is at pos43, those locations should not be clear. So this is a problem. But perhaps the user made a typo. Or maybe "clear" refers to being free of stones only? No, because the move action's preconditions require the l_to to be clear (so that the agent can move there). So "clear" must mean no agent or stone is present.

Therefore, the initial state as described is impossible. But since the user provided it, perhaps it's a mistake in their problem statement. Alternatively, maybe the "clear" in the original state is a typo. Let me proceed under the assumption that the initial state is correctly given, even if that seems contradictory. Wait, but the user is the one who provided the problem, so maybe they have a different way of defining "clear". Or maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the "clear" in the initial state is referring to something else, but given the problem's action definitions, the presence of the agent or a stone makes a location not clear. So the initial state must have pos44 not clear (since the agent is there), but the problem lists "Location pos44 is clear". This is conflicting. So perhaps there's an error in the problem statement. But since the user provided this, perhaps I need to proceed as if these are correct. Maybe "clear" here is a separate flag, but that doesn't make sense. This is confusing.

Alternatively, maybe the initial state's "Location pos44 is clear" is a mistake, and the correct initial state is that pos44 is occupied by the agent, hence not clear. But according to the problem's initial state, both the agent is at pos44 and pos44 is clear. That's a contradiction. Therefore, this is an error. However, the user must have intended that the initial state is possible, so perhaps "clear" refers to no stones, and the agent's presence doesn't affect it. But according to the action definitions, moving into a location requires it to be clear (which would include the agent not being there). So the initial state is impossible. But perhaps the problem statement is correct, and I need to proceed. Hmm. Let me assume that there's a mistake in the problem, but proceed with the given information. Maybe "clear" in the initial state refers to the absence of stones, not the agent. So even if the agent is present, the location is considered clear. That would make sense. So the agent's presence doesn't affect the "clear" status. Then, in the initial state, pos44 is clear (no stones) but has the agent. Then, when moving, the agent can move into a location if it's clear (no stones), even if another agent is there. But the problem says there's only one agent (player1), so that's not an issue. But this is conflicting with the action definitions. The move action's preconditions state that the l_to must be clear. If "clear" is only about stones, then the agent can move to a location with another agent. But since there's only one agent, that's not possible. Hmm. This is confusing. Maybe the problem's initial state has a typo, and "Location pos44 is clear" should not be present. Let's suppose that in the initial state, pos44 is not clear because the agent is there. Let's check the original state again.

Looking back, the original state lists:

- "player1 is at location pos44"

- "stone1 is at location pos43"

- Then, under the "clear" locations, pos43 and pos44 are listed as clear. But if a stone is at pos43, then pos43 shouldn't be clear. Similarly, the agent is at pos44, so pos44 shouldn't be clear. So there's a mistake here.

Given that, perhaps the problem intended that pos44 is not clear (since the agent is there) and pos43 is not clear (since the stone is there). Therefore, the initial clear locations should exclude pos43 and pos44. But according to the problem, they are listed as clear. This is conflicting. Maybe the user made a mistake in their problem setup. But as a solver, I need to proceed with the given information, even if it's conflicting. Alternatively, perhaps "clear" is defined as "no stone present", so the agent's presence doesn't affect it. But according to the action definitions, when you move, the l_to must be clear (so agent can't be there). So perhaps the problem's initial state is incorrect. But since I have to proceed, perhaps I need to ignore the conflicting parts and assume that the agent and stone are at their positions, and the clear locations are as given, but that the "clear" status is determined by the absence of stones, not agents. Therefore, when moving, the agent can go to a location that's clear (no stones) even if another agent is there. But since there's only one agent, this is a non-issue. But the move action's preconditions require that l_to is clear. So in that case, if "clear" means no stones, then the agent can move to any location without a stone, even if they are occupied by the agent. But that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps "clear" means that neither the agent nor a stone is present. Therefore, the initial state is invalid. But perhaps the user made a mistake. Given that, maybe I should proceed under the assumption that the initial state is correct as given, even though it's contradictory. But that's impossible. Therefore, perhaps the problem statement has a typo, and the clear locations should not include pos43 and pos44. But given that the user provided the problem, perhaps I need to proceed with the given data.

Alternatively, maybe the "clear" status is not affected by the agent. So the agent can be at a location that's considered clear. Then, when moving, the agent can move to a location that's clear (i.e., no stones), even if another agent is there. But since there's only one agent, this is not a problem. But this seems inconsistent with the action's effects. For example, when moving, the effect is that the agent is no longer at l_from and is at l_to. So in the initial state, the agent is at pos44, which is listed as clear. So according to the problem, the agent is present but the location is clear. So perhaps "clear" refers to the absence of stones only. Then, the agent's presence doesn't affect the "clear" status. Therefore, when moving, the preconditions require that l_to is clear (no stones), but the agent can be there. But that would allow multiple agents to be in the same location, which isn't possible here. But in this problem, there's only one agent. So the move action's preconditions would require that the l_to is clear (no stone), but the agent can be there. But that doesn't make sense. Because the move action's effect is that the agent is at l_to, so if the agent was already there, that's a conflict. Therefore, this suggests that the initial state is incorrect. But given the problem as stated, perhaps the user intended that pos44 is not clear, but it's listed as clear. So perhaps the user made a mistake. As a solver, perhaps I need to proceed with the given data, assuming that "clear" in the problem's initial state refers to the absence of stones, and the agent's presence doesn't affect it. So the agent can be at a clear location. Therefore, the initial state is valid.

In that case, the agent is at pos44, which is clear (no stones). Stone1 is at pos43, which is clear (but that's a contradiction because the stone is there). So maybe the problem's initial state has a mistake in listing pos43 as clear. Since the stone is at pos43, pos43 should not be clear. Therefore, perhaps the correct initial state is that pos43 is not clear, but it's listed as clear. So there's a mistake. But given that, how to proceed? The stone's location is at pos43, so pos43 should not be clear, but the problem says it is. This is conflicting. Therefore, perhaps the problem's initial state is incorrect, but the user intended that the stone is at pos43 and that pos43 is not clear. Therefore, the initial state's clear list is wrong. But I have to work with what's given.

This is a major issue. Let me try to proceed despite the confusion. The main point is that the agent starts at pos44, the stone is at pos43. The goal is to get the stone to pos51 (the only goal location). The constraints are that at some point the agent is at pos32, and when that happens, either pos44 was not clear (maybe because the agent moved away and then back, but pos44 was clear at some point?), or stone1 was at pos32 in an earlier state.

So the plan must include the agent being at pos32, and when that happens, prior to that, either pos44 wasn't clear (maybe when the agent moved away, but pos44 would be clear after moving) or stone1 was at pos32. So perhaps the agent needs to push the stone to pos32 first, then move to pos32, but that would require the stone to be at pos32 before the agent is there. Or maybe the agent moves to pos32 via some path, and before that, pos44 was not clear (which it wasn't initially, since the agent was there, so pos44 was not clear? But according to the initial state, pos44 is listed as clear. So this is conflicting.

Alternatively, perhaps the constraints require that if the agent is at pos32 at any point, then in an earlier state, either pos44 was not clear (i.e., had a stone or the agent there) or stone1 was at pos32. Initially, pos44 is clear (as per problem's state), but the agent is there. So the initial state has a contradiction. But proceeding despite that, perhaps in the initial state, pos44 is not clear because the agent is there. Therefore, the first part of the constraint is satisfied if the agent moves to pos32, because prior to that, pos44 was not clear (since the agent was there). So moving to pos32 would satisfy the constraint because in the initial state, pos44 was not clear (agent there), so the condition holds.

Therefore, the plan must include the agent being at pos32 at some point, and the constraint is satisfied because in the initial state, pos44 is not clear (since the agent is there). So the agent can move to pos32, and since prior to that, pos44 was not clear (agent there), the constraint is satisfied.

Now, the main goal is to get the stone to pos51. Let's see the possible paths. The stone is at pos43. To get to pos51, which is at the top right (assuming pos51 is in row 5, column 1). Wait, the locations are pos11, pos12,... pos55. pos51 is row5, column1. pos43 is row4, column3. So to move the stone to pos51, the agent needs to push it left to pos41, then up to pos31, then left to pos21, etc., but wait, pos51 is in row5, column1. Wait, pos51 is location pos51, which is row5, column1. So the stone is at pos43 (row4, column3). The agent is at pos44 (row4, column4). The goal is to get the stone to pos51.

So possible path: agent moves to pos43 (but stone is there, so can't move directly). Wait, no. The agent can only move to adjacent locations that are connected via allowed directions. To push the stone, the agent needs to be adjacent to it. So the stone is at pos43. The agent is at pos44. pos43 is adjacent to pos44 via direction dirup (since moving from pos44 to pos43 is dirup). Wait, looking at the movement allowed:

From pos44, you can move to pos34 (dirleft), pos54 (dirright), pos43 (dirup), or pos45 (dirdown). So the agent can move up to pos43. But the stone is there. So the agent can't move there. Therefore, the agent needs to push the stone. To push the stone from pos43 to a new location. Let's see the possible directions. From pos43, the allowed movements are:

- You may move from location pos43 to pos33 following direction dirleft.

- You may move from location pos43 to pos53 following direction dirright.

- You may move from location pos43 to pos42 following direction dirup.

- You may move from location pos43 to pos44 following direction dirdown.

But the stone is at pos43. To push it, the agent needs to be in a position adjacent to the stone and push it in a direction. For example, if the agent is at pos44, which is south of pos43, and pushes the stone north, but pos43's north is pos42. So pushing the stone from pos43 to pos42 would require the agent to be at pos43's south (pos44). So the agent is at pos44, which is south of pos43. To push the stone north (dirup) to pos42, the agent can perform a pushtonongoal (since pos42 is a non-goal location). Then, the stone moves to pos42, and the agent moves to pos43.

But pos42 is a non-goal location. Then, the stone is at pos42. Then, the agent can push it further. Alternatively, after moving to pos43, the agent can push the stone to pos33 (dirleft) or pos53 (dirright). Let's see.

Alternatively, the agent needs to push the stone towards pos51. pos51 is in row5, column1. So from pos43, the stone needs to go west (dirleft) to pos42, then west to pos41, then south to pos51? Wait, pos41 is row4, column1. pos51 is row5, column1. So from pos41, south is pos51. So if the stone can be pushed to pos41, then to pos51.

So the path would be: pos43 → pos42 (dirup), then pos42 → pos41 (dirleft), then pos41 → pos51 (dirright? Or is pos41 connected to pos51 via dirright? Looking at the allowed movements:

From pos41, you can move to pos31 (dirleft) or pos51 (dirright), or pos42 (dirdown). So yes, pos41 can move right to pos51. So if the stone is at pos41, the agent can push it to pos51 (which is a goal location), using pushtogoal.

So the steps would be:

1. Agent pushes stone1 from pos43 to pos42 (dirup) using pushtonongoal. The agent is at pos44, pushes the stone up (dirup) to pos42. So the action would be pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos43 pos42 dirup. Preconditions: agent is at pos44 (yes), stone is at pos43 (yes), pos42 is clear (yes, initial state says pos42 is clear), can move from pos44 to pos43 (dirup) (yes, per allowed movements), can move from pos43 to pos42 (dirup) (yes). pos42 is a non-goal (yes), so action is valid. After this, stone is at pos42, agent is at pos43.

2. Then, agent needs to push stone from pos42 to pos41. Agent is at pos43. To push the stone from pos42 to pos41, the agent needs to be adjacent to pos42. pos42 is adjacent to pos43 (south?), but according to allowed movements, from pos43, moving dirup is to pos42? Let me check the allowed movements for pos43:

Looking at the list, "You may move from location pos43 to location pos42 following direction dirup". So yes, from pos43, dirup is to pos42. So if the agent is at pos43, they can push the stone at pos42 to pos41 (dirleft). So the action would be pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos42 pos41 dirleft. Preconditions: agent is at pos43 (yes after first action), stone is at pos42 (yes), pos41 is clear (initial state says pos41 is clear, but after first action, agent moved to pos43 and stone to pos42. So pos41 remains clear. So yes. Can move from pos43 to pos42 (dirup) (yes), and from pos42 to pos41 (dirleft) (yes). pos41 is a non-goal (yes). So valid. After this, stone is at pos41, agent is at pos42.

3. Then, agent can push the stone from pos41 to pos51. Since pos51 is a goal location. The agent is at pos42. To push the stone from pos41 to pos51, the agent needs to be at pos41's adjacent location. pos41 is connected to pos42 (dirdown?), so the agent can move to pos41, then push. Wait, agent is at pos42 after step 2. So to push the stone at pos41, the agent needs to be at pos41's adjacent tile. pos41 is connected to pos42 via dirdown (from pos41 to pos42 is dirdown). So the agent is at pos42. To push the stone at pos41, the agent needs to be at pos41's south (pos42). So the direction from pos41 to pos42 is dirdown, but to push from pos41 to pos51 (dirright), the agent would need to be at pos41's west (dirleft) or east (dirright)? Wait, pos41's east is pos51 (dirright). So to push the stone from pos41 to pos51 (dirright), the agent needs to be at pos41's west (dirleft) side. Because to push, the agent must be adjacent to the stone and push in a direction. So if the stone is at pos41, and the agent is at pos42 (south of pos41), then the direction to push the stone east (dirright) to pos51 requires that the agent is west of the stone? Wait, no. The agent is south of the stone. To push the stone east, the agent would need to be west of the stone. Because pushing is done from behind. For example, if the agent is south of the stone, pushing north would move the stone north. But to push east, the agent needs to be west of the stone.

But according to the allowed movements, to push the stone from pos41 to pos51 (dirright), the agent must be at pos41's west (dirleft) direction. But pos41's west is pos31. So the agent needs to be at pos31 to push the stone east to pos51. But the agent is currently at pos42. So this seems complicated.

Alternative approach: after step 2, the stone is at pos41. The agent is at pos42. To push the stone to pos51, the agent needs to get to pos41's west (pos31) or north (if possible) or south. Wait, pos41's adjacent locations are pos31 (west), pos51 (east), and pos42 (south). So the agent is at pos42 (south of pos41). To push the stone east to pos51, the agent must be west of the stone (pos41's west is pos31). So the agent can't push east from the south. So the agent needs to move around to pos31.

So steps:

3. Agent moves from pos42 to pos32 (dirleft?), then to pos31.

Wait, agent is at pos42. From pos42, allowed movements are:

- dirleft to pos32 (since "You may move from location pos42 to location pos32 following direction dirleft")

- dirright to pos52 (but that's not needed)

- dirup to pos41 (but pos41 has the stone now, so it's not clear. After step 2, stone is at pos41, so pos41 is not clear. So agent can't move there.

So agent can move from pos42 to pos32 (dirleft). Then from pos32 to pos31 (dirleft again). Once at pos31, the agent can push the stone from pos41 to pos51 (dirright).

But first, after step 2, the stone is at pos41. The agent is at pos42. pos41 is not clear (stone there), so agent can't move there. So agent needs to move to pos32, then to pos31.

So step 3: move player1 from pos42 to pos32 (dirleft). Preconditions: agent is at pos42, pos32 is clear. Initial state says pos32 is clear. After step 2, pos32 is still clear. So yes.

Action: move player1 pos42 pos32 dirleft.

After moving, agent is at pos32. Now, according to the constraints, if the agent is at pos32, there must be an earlier state where pos44 was not clear (which it was initially) or stone1 was at pos32. In this case, the agent is at pos32 now. The earlier state (initial state) had pos44 not clear (agent was there), so this satisfies the constraint.

Now, agent is at pos32. Next step: move to pos31. From pos32, can move to pos31 (dirup?), or dirleft to pos22, etc. Let's check allowed movements:

From pos32, you can move to pos22 (dirleft), pos42 (dirright), pos31 (dirup), or pos33 (dirdown).

So agent can move from pos32 to pos31 via dirup.

Action: move player1 pos32 pos31 dirup.

Now, agent is at pos31. Stone is at pos41. To push it to pos51 (dirright). The agent is at pos31, which is west of pos41. So pushing east (dirright) to pos51.

Action: pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos41 pos51 dirright.

Preconditions: agent is at pos31 (yes), stone is at pos41 (yes), pos51 is clear (initially yes, and after previous steps, pos51 remains clear). Can move from pos31 to pos41 (dirright?) Let's check allowed movements:

From pos31, allowed movements are:

"You may move from location pos31 to location pos21 following direction dirleft"

"You may move from location pos31 to location pos41 following direction dirright"

"You may move from location pos31 to location pos32 following direction dirdown"

Yes, moving from pos31 to pos41 is dirright. Then, from pos41 to pos51 is dirright (as per allowed movement from pos41 to pos51).

So the pushtogoal action would require that the agent is at pos31 (l_p), stone is at pos41 (l_from), pushing to pos51 (l_to) via dirright.

Preconditions check:

- agent at pos31: yes.

- stone at pos41: yes.

- pos51 is clear: yes.

- can move from pos31 to pos41 (dirright): yes.

- can move from pos41 to pos51 (dirright): yes.

- pos51 is a goal location: yes.

So this action is valid.

After this action, the stone is at pos51 (goal achieved), and the agent is at pos41.

So the full plan would be:

1. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos43 pos42 dirup

2. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos42 pos41 dirleft

3. move player1 pos42 pos32 dirleft

4. move player1 pos32 pos31 dirup

5. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos41 pos51 dirright

But wait, step 3 is moving to pos32, which triggers the constraint. The constraint requires that when the agent is at pos32, there was an earlier state where pos44 was not clear or stone1 was at pos32. In this plan, step 3 is moving to pos32. The earlier states are steps 1-2. In the initial state, pos44 was not clear (agent was there). So the constraint is satisfied.

Now, checking if this plan is optimal. Are there fewer steps possible?

Alternative approach: Can the agent reach pos32 earlier to satisfy the constraint with fewer steps?

Alternative plan:

Starting at pos44. The agent needs to move to pos32. Let's see the path from pos44 to pos32.

From pos44, directions: can move to pos34 (dirleft), pos54 (dirright), pos43 (dirup), pos45 (dirdown).

To get to pos32, the agent would need to go west (dirleft) to pos34, then north to pos24, then west to pos23, etc. Alternatively, move up to pos43 (but stone is there, so can't move). So agent can't move to pos43 unless pushing the stone.

So initial steps: agent must push the stone out of pos43 to get to pos43.

Wait, but pushing the stone from pos43 to pos42 (dirup) as before, then the agent is at pos43. Then, move to pos33, pos32.

But in this case, after pushing the stone to pos42, agent is at pos43. Then, from pos43, can move to pos33 (dirleft), then to pos32 (dirdown?).

Wait, pos43 can move to pos33 via dirleft. From pos33, can move to pos32 via dirup? Let's check allowed movements for pos33:

"You may move from location pos33 to location pos23 following direction dirleft"

"You may move from location pos33 to location pos43 following direction dirright"

"You may move from location pos33 to location pos32 following direction dirup"

"You may move from location pos33 to location pos34 following direction dirdown"

So from pos33, dirup is to pos32. So agent at pos43 can move to pos33 (dirleft), then to pos32 (dirup). Then, agent is at pos32, satisfying the constraint. Then proceed to push the stone.

But would this path be shorter?

Alternative plan:

1. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos43 pos42 dirup (stone at pos42, agent at pos43)

2. move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft

3. move player1 pos33 pos32 dirup (now at pos32, triggering constraint)

Then proceed to push the stone to pos41 and then pos51.

But after step 1, stone is at pos42. Then, the agent can move to pos33, then to pos32. Then, from pos32, how to get back to push the stone. Alternatively, after step 3, the agent is at pos32. Then needs to get to pos42 to push the stone to pos41. So:

4. move player1 pos32 pos42 dirright (from pos32 to pos42 is allowed via dirright)

5. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos42 pos41 dirleft (wait, the stone is at pos42. So the agent is at pos42. To push the stone to pos41 (dirleft), the agent must be at pos42's west (dirleft) side. Wait, no. The agent is at pos42. The stone is at pos42? No, after step 1, the stone is at pos42. So after step 1, the stone is at pos42. Then agent moves to pos33, pos32, then to pos42. But when the agent is at pos42, the stone is already there. So they can't both be at the same location. Therefore, this approach won't work. So after step 1, the stone is at pos42, agent at pos43. Then agent moves to pos33, pos32. Then, to push the stone from pos42 to pos41, the agent needs to be adjacent to pos42. So from pos32, agent can move to pos42 (dirright). But pos42 has the stone, so it's not clear. So the agent can't move there. Therefore, this approach isn't possible.

Thus, the initial plan of moving via pos32 after pushing the stone to pos42 and pos41 seems better.

Alternatively, after step 2 in the original plan (stone at pos41, agent at pos42), the agent can move to pos32, then to pos31, then push to pos51. That's steps 3,4,5.

But maybe there's a shorter path. Let's count the steps:

Original plan:

1. pushtonongoal (pos44 → pos43 → pos42)

2. pushtonongoal (pos43 → pos42 → pos41)

3. move (pos42 → pos32)

4. move (pos32 → pos31)

5. pushtogoal (pos31 → pos41 → pos51)

Total of 5 actions.

Is there a way to do it in fewer steps?

Alternative approach: after pushing the stone to pos42 (step1), then push it to pos32, but pos32 is a non-goal. Then push it to pos31, then to pos41, etc. But this may take more steps.

Alternatively, after step1 (stone at pos42), agent at pos43. Then agent moves to pos33, pos32 (satisfy constraint), then move to pos42 (but stone is there). Not helpful.

Alternatively, after step1, agent is at pos43. Push the stone to pos33 (dirleft). Then, agent is at pos43. To push from pos42 to pos33, the agent needs to be at pos42's east (dirright) to push west. Wait, the stone is at pos42. To push it to pos33 (west?), the agent needs to be east of pos42. pos42's east is pos43. But the agent is at pos43. So can push from pos42 to pos33 by dirleft. Wait, allowed movements:

From pos42, can you move to pos32 (dirleft), pos52 (dirright), pos41 (dirup), pos43 (dirdown).

Wait, the stone is at pos42. To push it west to pos32, the agent must be at pos42's east (pos43). So the agent is at pos43. Then, pushing the stone west (dirleft) to pos32. Is that allowed?

The action would be pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos42 pos32 dirleft.

Preconditions: agent is at pos43 (yes), stone is at pos42 (yes), pos32 is clear (yes). Can move from pos43 to pos42 (dirup? Wait, the allowed movement from pos43 to pos42 is dirup. Then from pos42 to pos32 is dirleft. So the direction for the push is dirleft. So the agent is at pos43, which is south of pos42. To push the stone west (dirleft), the agent must be able to move from pos43 to pos42 (dirup) and then from pos42 to pos32 (dirleft). So the action would be pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos42 pos32 dirleft. But pos32 is a non-goal location. So valid.

After this, stone is at pos32, agent is at pos42. Then, the agent can move to pos32 (since it's now clear?), but after pushing, the stone is at pos32, so pos32 is not clear. So agent can't move there. Hmm. Alternatively, then the agent can push the stone from pos32 to pos31 (dirup), but pos31 is a non-goal. Then, from pos31 to pos41, etc.

But this seems longer. Let's see:

Step1: push stone to pos42.

Step2: push stone to pos32.

Step3: push stone to pos31.

Step4: push stone to pos41.

Step5: push to pos51.

That's 5 steps, same as before. But also, when the agent is at pos32 (after step2), the stone is at pos32. So the constraint is satisfied because stone was at pos32 in the same step. So when the agent is at pos32, the stone is there, but the constraint requires that in an earlier state, the stone was at pos32. So in this case, the agent is at pos32 and the stone is also there. But the constraint says that if the agent is at pos32 in some state, then there must be an earlier state where either pos44 was not clear or stone was at pos32. In this scenario, when the agent is at pos32 (step2), the stone is also there. So the current state has stone at pos32, which would satisfy the "earlier state" (same state?), but the constraint says "earlier state". So perhaps the state after step2 has agent at pos42 (after pushing), and stone at pos32. Wait, the pushtonongoal action's effect is that the agent moves to pos42 (l_from) after pushing. So after step2, agent is at pos42, stone is at pos32. So the agent is not at pos32. Then, in a later step, the agent can move to pos32. But then, the constraint requires that prior to that, stone was at pos32. So in this case, the stone was at pos32 in step2, which is earlier than the agent moving to pos32 in step3. So this would satisfy the constraint.

But this path may not be shorter. Let's outline:

Plan B:

1. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos43 pos42 dirup (agent at pos43, stone at pos42)

2. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos42 pos32 dirleft (agent at pos42, stone at pos32)

3. move player1 pos42 pos32 dirleft (agent at pos32, but stone is there. Can't move there, since pos32 is not clear. So this is invalid.

So step3 is invalid. So the agent can't move to pos32 because the stone is there.

Thus, after step2, stone is at pos32. Agent is at pos42. Then, agent can push the stone from pos32 to pos31 (dirup). So step3: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos31 dirup. Preconditions: agent at pos42 (yes), stone at pos32 (yes), pos31 is clear (yes). Can move from pos42 to pos32 (dirleft?), then from pos32 to pos31 (dirup). So the direction is dirup. Wait, the allowed movement from pos42 to pos32 is dirleft. From pos32 to pos31 is dirup. So the action is pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos31 dirup.

After this, agent is at pos32, stone at pos31. Then, agent can move to pos31 and push to pos41, etc. But this seems longer.

Thus, the original plan is still better.

Therefore, the optimal plan is the one with 5 steps as previously outlined. Let's verify each action's preconditions and effects:

1. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos43 pos42 dirup:

- Pre: agent at pos44 (yes), stone at pos43 (yes), pos42 clear (yes). Can move from pos44 to pos43 (dirup), and from pos43 to pos42 (dirup). pos42 is non-goal (yes).

- Effects: agent leaves pos44, stone leaves pos43, pos42 not clear. Agent moves to pos43, stone to pos42. pos44 becomes clear.

2. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos42 pos41 dirleft:

- Pre: agent at pos43 (yes), stone at pos42 (yes), pos41 clear (yes). Can move from pos43 to pos42 (dirup) and from pos42 to pos41 (dirleft). pos41 is non-goal.

- Effects: agent moves to pos42, stone to pos41. pos43 becomes clear.

3. move player1 pos42 pos32 dirleft:

- Pre: agent at pos42 (yes), pos32 clear (yes). Can move from pos42 to pos32 dirleft.

- Effects: agent moves to pos32, pos42 becomes clear.

4. move player1 pos32 pos31 dirup:

- Pre: agent at pos32 (yes), pos31 clear (yes). Can move from pos32 to pos31 dirup.

- Effects: agent moves to pos31, pos32 becomes clear.

5. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos41 pos51 dirright:

- Pre: agent at pos31 (yes), stone at pos41 (yes), pos51 clear (yes). Can move from pos31 to pos41 dirright, and from pos41 to pos51 dirright. pos51 is goal.

- Effects: agent moves to pos41, stone to pos51. pos31 becomes clear.

This results in stone1 at pos51, which is a goal location. All constraints are met: agent was at pos32 in step3, and in the initial state, pos44 was not clear (agent was there), satisfying the constraint.

This plan has 5 actions. Can it be shorter?

Alternative approach: After step2, the stone is at pos41. Can the agent move directly from pos42 to pos41? But pos41 has the stone, so it's not clear. So no. The agent needs to go around. So steps 3-5 are necessary.

Thus, this seems to be the optimal plan.
