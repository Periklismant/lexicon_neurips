Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. So, the goal is to get stone1 to a goal location. The only goal location mentioned is pos12. The initial state has the agent (player1) at pos41, and stone1 is at pos42. The grid is 5x5, from pos11 to pos55.

First, I need to figure out the path for the agent to reach the stone and then push it to the goal. Let's map out the positions. The agent starts at pos41. The stone is at pos42. So they're adjacent horizontally. Wait, pos41 to pos42 is a direction of dirdown? Let me check the movement rules. The movement from pos41 to pos42 is via dirdown. Yes, because looking at the allowed moves, "You may move from location pos41 to location pos42 following direction dirdown". So the agent can move directly down to pos42. But wait, in the initial state, pos42 is where the stone is, so it's not clear. Wait, the initial state says "stone1 is at location pos42" and "Location pos42 is clear". Wait, but if the stone is there, is it considered clear? Wait, the problem says "Each position on the grid may contain either the agent, a stone or be empty." So a location is clear if neither the agent nor a stone is there. Wait, but the initial state says "Location pos42 is clear", but stone1 is at pos42. That's a contradiction. Wait, no, maybe the problem's initial state has a mistake. Wait, let me check again.

Looking back: The original state says "stone1 is at location pos42" and "Location pos42 is clear". That can't be possible. Because if a stone is at pos42, then pos42 is not clear. So maybe there's a mistake here. Or perhaps the definition of "clear" is different. Wait, the problem statement says each position may contain either the agent, a stone, or be empty. So a location is clear if it's empty. So if a stone is there, the location is not clear. Therefore, the initial state seems conflicting. But according to the given original state, "stone1 is at location pos42" and "Location pos42 is clear" are both true. That must be an error. But since that's how it's given, perhaps the problem is that the stone's presence doesn't block the location's clearness? But that contradicts the problem's description. Hmm, this is confusing. Wait, looking at the effects of actions: when you push a stone, the location to becomes not clear. So probably, the presence of a stone makes the location not clear. Therefore, the initial state must have a mistake. But the user provided the problem as such. So perhaps in this problem, the initial state is that pos42 has the stone, but it's considered clear. That might be a mistake, but we have to work with the given information. Alternatively, maybe "clear" refers to the agent not being there. But that's not how the preconditions are written. For example, the move action requires the destination to be clear. So if a stone is there, the move can't be done. So in the initial state, pos42 has a stone, so it's not clear. But the problem says "Location pos42 is clear". That's conflicting. This is a problem. How to resolve this?

Wait, maybe the problem's original state is correct. Let's re-examine. The original state lists:

- "stone1 is at location pos42"
- "Location pos42 is clear"

That seems contradictory. Unless "clear" refers to the agent not being present, and stones are allowed. But according to the problem statement, "Each position on the grid may contain either the agent, a stone or be empty." So a location is clear only if it's empty. So if a stone is there, it's not clear. Therefore, the given initial state is invalid. But since the problem is given as such, perhaps there's a misunderstanding. Alternatively, maybe the initial state is correct, and the stone's presence doesn't affect the clearness. But that can't be, because the move action's precondition requires the destination to be clear. So if a stone is at pos42, the agent cannot move there. But according to the problem's original state, the agent is at pos41, and the stone is at pos42. The move action from pos41 to pos42 (direction dirdown) is allowed if pos42 is clear. But in the original state, pos42 is clear, but the stone is there. So that's a contradiction. Therefore, perhaps the original state has a typo, and the stone is at pos43, but that's not the case. Alternatively, maybe the "clear" status is separate from the presence of stones. Maybe a location is clear if the agent isn't there, and stones can be present. But the problem statement says that a position can contain the agent, a stone, or be empty. So "clear" would mean empty. So the presence of a stone would make it not clear. Therefore, the original state's "Location pos42 is clear" is incorrect if the stone is there. This is a problem, but perhaps it's a mistake in the problem setup, and we have to proceed under the assumption that the stone is at pos42, and pos42 is not clear. Or maybe the problem has a different definition of clear. This is a bit confusing, but perhaps I should proceed as per the given information.

Assuming that the initial state is correctly described, even if it's conflicting. Wait, but the problem says "Location pos42 is clear" in the original state. So according to the problem, pos42 is clear. So even though stone1 is there, it's considered clear. That's conflicting with the problem's own definition. Therefore, maybe there's a mistake in the problem's initial state. But perhaps the user intended that the stone is at pos42, and pos42 is not clear, but the problem says it is. In that case, the problem is impossible. But since the task is to find a valid plan, perhaps I should proceed under the assumption that the stone is at pos42 and pos42 is not clear, and the problem's original state has a typo. Alternatively, maybe the problem's initial state lists "stone1 is at location pos42" and "Location pos42 is clear" as both true, which would imply that having a stone doesn't block the location. But that's not how the preconditions are defined. For example, the move action requires the destination to be clear. So if a stone is there, the agent can't move into it. But according to the problem's initial state, pos42 has a stone and is clear, which would allow the agent to move there. But that's not possible. This is a problem. Therefore, perhaps the correct initial state is that pos42 is not clear because the stone is there, but the problem's description lists it as clear. This is a contradiction. So perhaps the problem has a typo, and the stone is at pos43, but that's not the case. Alternatively, maybe the problem's movement rules allow the agent to move into a location with a stone, but that's against the given action preconditions. The move action's precondition (ii) says location l_to is clear. So the agent can't move into a location with a stone. Therefore, the initial state is invalid. But since the problem is given as such, maybe the user made a mistake. But regardless, I need to proceed with the given information.

Wait, looking again at the original state:

- "stone1 is at location pos42"
- "Location pos42 is clear"

This is a contradiction. Therefore, perhaps the stone is actually at pos43, but the problem says pos42. Or maybe the "Location pos42 is clear" is a mistake. Let's check the original state's list again. The original state lists:

- "Location pos11 is clear"
- ... (many locations)
- "Location pos43 is clear"
- "Location pos44 is clear"
- "Location pos45 is clear"
- ... etc.
- "Location pos41 is clear"
- "Location pos42 is clear"

So according to the original state, pos42 is clear. But the stone is at pos42. Therefore, the problem's initial state is inconsistent. Since this is a problem given by the user, perhaps it's a test to see if I can notice this inconsistency. But in that case, the problem is unsolvable because the stone is already at pos42, which is a non-goal location. The only goal location is pos12. Therefore, the agent must push the stone to pos12. So the plan would involve moving the agent to the stone, pushing it through the grid to pos12.

But first, the agent is at pos41. Stone is at pos42. So the agent is adjacent to the stone (pos41 is row 4, column 1; pos42 is row 4, column 2). So the agent is to the left of the stone. The movement directions: from pos41, you can move to pos42 via dirdown. Wait, no. Let me check the allowed movements. The movement from pos41 to pos42 is via dirdown. Wait, the directions are dirup, dirdown, dirleft, dirright. Wait, how are these directions defined? For example, moving from pos41 to pos42 is dirdown. But pos41 is (4,1), pos42 is (4,2). So perhaps the grid is rows and columns, where moving right increases the column number. But the movement direction might be defined as per the problem's movement rules. Let me check the movement from pos41. The allowed moves from pos41 are:

"You may move from location pos41 to location pos31 following direction dirleft"

Wait, pos31 is row 3, column 1. So dirleft from pos41 (row 4, column 1) would be to pos31? That doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe the grid is structured differently. Alternatively, maybe the movement directions are mapped differently. Let's look at the movement rules for pos41:

- "You may move from location pos41 to location pos31 following direction dirleft"
- "You may move from location pos41 to location pos51 following direction dirright"
- "You may move from location pos41 to location pos42 following direction dirdown"

Wait, that's confusing. pos41 to pos31 is dirleft. pos41 to pos51 is dirright. pos41 to pos42 is dirdown. So the directions are perhaps relative to the grid's layout. Maybe the grid is such that moving dirleft decreases the row number, dirright increases the row number, dirup decreases the column, dirdown increases the column. Or perhaps it's the other way around. Let's see:

pos11 is (1,1), pos12 (1,2), ..., pos15 (1,5)

pos21 (2,1), ..., pos25 (2,5)

...

pos51 (5,1), ..., pos55 (5,5)

So moving from pos41 (4,1) to pos31 (3,1) would be dirleft (since row decreases by 1). Moving to pos51 (5,1) is dirright (row increases by 1). Moving to pos42 (4,2) is dirdown (column increases by 1). So the directions are:

- dirleft: row decreases by 1 (same column)
- dirright: row increases by 1 (same column)
- dirup: column decreases by 1 (same row)
- dirdown: column increases by 1 (same row)

So for pos41 (row 4, column 1), moving dirdown would take the agent to pos42 (row 4, column 2). But according to the movement rules, "You may move from location pos41 to location pos42 following direction dirdown". So that's correct.

So the agent is at pos41. The stone is at pos42. The agent can move to pos42 if it's clear. But according to the original state, pos42 is clear. But the stone is there. Therefore, this is a contradiction. But given the problem as stated, perhaps we have to proceed under the assumption that pos42 is clear despite the stone being there. That is, the stone's presence doesn't block the location's clearness. But that's against the problem's own definitions. So perhaps the initial state is correct, and the stone is at pos42, but pos42 is considered clear. That would mean that the stone doesn't block the agent from moving there. But according to the move action's preconditions, the destination must be clear. So if pos42 is clear, the agent can move there. But then, after moving, the agent is at pos42, and the stone is also there. But the problem states that each position can contain either the agent, a stone, or be empty. So they can't be both there. Therefore, this is impossible. Therefore, there's a mistake in the problem's initial state. But since I have to proceed, perhaps the correct initial state is that the stone is at pos42, and pos42 is not clear. Therefore, the agent cannot move there. So the agent must find a way around.

Alternatively, maybe the stone is at pos43, but the problem says pos42. That's a possibility, but the problem clearly states "stone1 is at location pos42". So perhaps the correct way is to proceed, assuming that the stone's location is pos42, but the initial state mistakenly says pos42 is clear. Therefore, pos42 is not clear, and the agent cannot move there. Therefore, the agent must move around to push the stone.

Wait, but the agent is at pos41. The stone is at pos42. To push the stone, the agent needs to be adjacent to it in the direction opposite to where the stone is to be pushed. For example, to push the stone east (dirright), the agent would need to be west of the stone. But in this case, the agent is at pos41 (west of pos42). So if the agent is at pos41, and the stone is at pos42, the agent can push the stone east to pos43, provided pos43 is clear. But pos43 is clear in the initial state. So let's check the preconditions for pushtonongoal (since pos43 is not a goal location). So the action would be "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos41 pos42 pos43 dirdown". Wait, direction dirdown here would be from pos42 to pos43. Because pos42 to pos43 is moving dirdown (column increases by 1). But the agent is at pos41, which is west of pos42. To push the stone from pos42 to pos43 (east), the agent needs to be at pos42's west (pos41), and push east. But according to the movement rules, can the agent move from pos41 to pos42 (direction dirdown) to reach the stone? But if pos42 is not clear (because the stone is there), the agent can't move there. So the agent can't perform a move action to get to pos42. Therefore, the agent can't push the stone from pos41 to pos42, because the agent is at pos41, and the stone is at pos42, but the agent can't move into pos42 to push it. Wait, but the push actions require the agent to be at l_p, which is adjacent to l_from (the stone's current location), and the direction d allows moving from l_p to l_from. So for the pushtonongoal action, the agent is at l_p (pos41), and the stone is at l_from (pos42). The direction d must allow moving from l_p (pos41) to l_from (pos42), which is dirdown. Then, the stone is pushed from l_from (pos42) to l_to (pos43) following direction dirdown (since pos42 to pos43 is dirdown). The preconditions for pushtonongoal are:

(i) agent p is at l_p (pos41)
(ii) stone s is at l_from (pos42)
(iii) l_to (pos43) is clear (which it is)
(iv) can get from l_p (pos41) to l_from (pos42) following d (dirdown) → yes, according to movement rules.
(v) can get from l_from (pos42) to l_to (pos43) following d (dirdown) → yes, according to movement rules.
(vi) l_to is not a goal → pos43 is not a goal.

So all preconditions are met. Therefore, the agent can perform pushtonongoal from pos41 to push the stone from pos42 to pos43.

But wait, after performing this action, the agent moves to pos42, the stone moves to pos43, and the agent is now at pos42. Then, the agent can proceed to push the stone further towards the goal. The goal is to get the stone to pos12, which is a goal location. So the plan would involve moving the stone from pos42 to pos43, then pos44, pos45, then moving up to pos35, pos25, etc. But that's a long path. Alternatively, maybe there's a shorter path.

But let's think step by step. First, the agent is at pos41. The stone is at pos42. The agent can push the stone east (dirdown) to pos43. Then, the agent is at pos42. From there, can the agent push the stone further east to pos44? Let's see. After the first push, the agent is at pos42. The stone is at pos43. So to push the stone from pos43 to pos44, the agent needs to be adjacent to pos43 in the direction opposite to the push. So if the agent is at pos43's west (pos42), then pushing east (dirdown) to pos44. But the agent is at pos42. So the action would be pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos43 pos44 dirdown. Preconditions:

- agent at pos42 (yes, after first action)
- stone at pos43 (yes)
- pos44 is clear (yes)
- can move from pos42 to pos43 via dirdown? Let's check the movement rules. Looking for "You may move from location pos42 to location pos43 following direction dirdown". The movement rules include "You may move from location pos42 to location pos43 following direction dirdown". Yes. So yes.
- can move from pos43 to pos44 via dirdown? Yes.
- pos44 is not a goal (correct).

So after pushing to pos44, the agent is at pos43. Then, the stone is at pos44. Now, the agent can push it further east to pos45. Then, pos45 to pos55? Wait, pos45 to pos55 is via dirright. Wait, movement from pos45 to pos55 is dirright. But pos45 is row4, column5. dirright would be row5, column5 (pos55). But to push the stone from pos45 to pos55, the agent needs to be at pos44 (west of pos45). But let's see. Alternatively, perhaps the agent can push the stone northward.

But the goal is to get the stone to pos12. So after getting the stone to pos45, the agent would need to push it north. For example, pos45 → pos35 → pos25 → pos15 → pos14 → ... but pos15 is not a goal. The only goal is pos12. So the path would be complicated.

Alternatively, after pushing the stone to pos43, maybe the agent can push it north. Let's see. After the first push to pos43, the stone is at pos43. The agent is at pos42. To push north (dirup, decreasing column), the agent needs to be south of the stone. Wait, directions are:

dirup: column decreases by 1 (same row)
dirdown: column increases by 1 (same row)
dirleft: row decreases by 1 (same column)
dirright: row increases by 1 (same column)

So to push the stone north (dirup), the agent needs to be south of the stone. For example, if the stone is at pos43 (row4, column3), the agent can be at pos44 (row4, column4) and push north (dirup) to pos42 (row4, column2). Wait, no. Let me clarify.

Wait, pushing the stone north (dirup) would decrease the column by 1. So from pos43 (column3), pushing north (dirup) would take it to pos42 (column2). But the agent needs to be at the position south of the stone to push it north. Wait, no. If the stone is at pos43, to push it north (dirup) to pos42, the agent needs to be at pos43's south (pos44) and push north? Wait, no. Because the direction of the push is dirup, which is north. The agent has to be adjacent to the stone in the direction opposite to the push. So to push the stone north (dirup), the agent must be south of the stone (dirdown direction). But if the stone is at pos43, the agent would need to be at pos44 (same row, column4) to push it north (dirup) to pos42? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps the agent needs to be in the direction they're pushing from. For example, to push the stone north (dirup), the agent must be south of the stone (so the agent is pushing from south to north). But according to the movement directions, to push from the agent's position to the stone's position, the direction must be possible. For example, if the agent is at pos44 (south of pos43), and wants to push the stone north to pos42, the direction from agent's position (pos44) to stone's position (pos43) is dirup (column decreases by 1). Then, the stone is pushed from pos43 to pos42 (dirup). So the action would be pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos43 pos42 dirup. But the agent is currently at pos42 after the first push. To get to pos44, the agent would need to move from pos42 to pos43, then to pos44. But after the first push, the stone is at pos43, which is now occupied. So the agent can't move there. Therefore, the agent can't get to pos44 to push the stone north.

This is getting complicated. Let's think of the optimal path. The stone needs to reach pos12, which is a goal. The initial position of the stone is pos42. The grid's movement allows moving in four directions. The agent can push the stone in any direction as long as the path is clear.

The shortest path would probably involve moving the stone up (dirup) to pos32, then to pos22, then to pos12. Let's see. From pos42, pushing dirup (column decreases by 1) to pos32. Wait, pos42 is row4, column2. dirup would be column1, so pos41. But pos41 is the initial position of the agent. Alternatively, pushing north (dirup) from pos42 would decrease the column by 1, leading to pos41. But pos41 is the initial position of the agent, which is now at pos42 after the first push. Wait, after the first push (pushtonongoal to pos43), the agent is at pos42. So after that, the stone is at pos43, and the agent is at pos42. Then, the agent can push the stone north (dirup) to pos42's column1, which is pos41. But pos41 is clear. Wait, no. The stone is at pos43. To push it north (dirup), the agent needs to be south of the stone. The stone is at pos43 (row4, column3). To push it north (dirup) to pos42 (row4, column2), the agent needs to be south of the stone. South would be row5, column3. But the grid only goes up to row5. So pos53 is row5, column3. The agent would need to be there. But the agent is at pos42. So that's not possible. Alternatively, maybe the agent can move around to push the stone upwards.

This is getting too complicated. Maybe it's better to find the shortest path by moving the stone up through the grid. Let's outline the steps:

1. Agent is at pos41, stone at pos42.

First, push the stone east to pos43. Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos41 pos42 pos43 dirdown.

Now, agent is at pos42, stone at pos43.

2. Push the stone east to pos44. Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos43 pos44 dirdown.

Agent at pos43, stone at pos44.

3. Push east to pos45. Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos44 pos45 dirdown.

Agent at pos44, stone at pos45.

4. Push north (dirup) to pos44's column4-1=3, so pos44 → pos43? Wait, dirup would decrease the column. pos45 is row4, column5. dirup would go to column4, which is pos44. But pos44 is clear? After the previous steps, pos44 is where the agent is after pushing to pos45. Wait, after pushing to pos45, the agent is at pos44. So pos44 is occupied by the agent. So the stone is at pos45. To push it north (dirup), the agent needs to be south of the stone. South of pos45 is row5, column5 (pos55). But the agent is at pos44. So the agent needs to move to pos55? That's a long way. Alternatively, maybe push the stone west back to pos44, but that's not helpful.

Alternatively, after the stone is at pos45, the agent can move around to the other side to push it north. For example, the agent can move from pos44 to pos54 (dirright), then to pos55 (dirdown), then to pos45 (dirleft), but pos45 has the stone. So this is not possible. Alternatively, perhaps after pushing the stone to pos45, the agent can move north (dirup) to pos34, then west, etc., but this is getting too long.

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to push the stone north early on. Let's try:

After the first push to pos43, the agent is at pos42. The stone is at pos43. The agent can move north (dirup) to pos32. Wait, can the agent move from pos42 to pos32? Let's check the movement rules. From pos42, can the agent move to pos32 via dirup? Looking at the allowed movements for pos42:

"You may move from location pos42 to location pos32 following direction dirleft"

Yes. Because pos42 is row4, column2. pos32 is row3, column2. So moving dirleft (row decreases by 1). The movement rule says: "You may move from location pos42 to location pos32 following direction dirleft". So the agent can move from pos42 to pos32 via dirleft. Then, from pos32, the agent can move to pos22, then to pos12. But how does that help? The stone is at pos43. The agent needs to get to the other side to push it north.

Alternatively, after the stone is at pos43, the agent is at pos42. The agent can move to pos32 (dirleft from pos42), then to pos22, then to pos12. But that's just moving the agent to the goal location, not the stone. The stone is still at pos43.

Wait, the goal is to have the stone at a goal location (pos12). So the agent needs to push the stone all the way to pos12.

Alternative plan:

Push the stone from pos42 to pos43, then to pos44, then to pos45. Then push north to pos35, then to pos25, then to pos15, then west to pos14, pos13, pos12. But pos15 is not a goal, so this path ends at pos12, which is a goal.

But how to push north from pos45. pos45 is row4, column5. Pushing north (dirup) would decrease the column by 1, so pos44. But that's moving west. Wait, no. dirup decreases the column. So from pos45 (column5), dirup would be column4, same row → pos44. So pushing north from pos45 to pos44. But pos44 is where the agent is after pushing to pos45. So that's not possible. Therefore, the agent needs to maneuver around.

Alternatively, after the stone is at pos45, the agent can move around to the east side. For example, move from pos44 to pos54 (dirright), then to pos55 (dirdown), then to pos45 (dirleft). But pos45 has the stone, so the agent can't move there. Therefore, the agent can't get east of the stone to push it west.

This seems very complicated. Perhaps there's a more efficient path. Let's think again. The agent starts at pos41. The stone is at pos42. The only goal is pos12.

Alternative approach: Push the stone west to pos41, but pos41 is where the agent starts. Wait, but the agent is at pos41. So to push the stone west from pos42 to pos41, the agent needs to be east of the stone (pos43) and push west. But the agent is at pos41. So that's not possible.

Alternatively, the agent can move to pos31 (dirleft from pos41), then to pos21, pos11, then move down to pos12. But the agent needs to push the stone. This approach doesn't involve the stone.

Another idea: The agent can move around to the north of the stone and push it south. But the stone is at pos42. To push it south (dirdown) to pos43, but that's the same as before.

Wait, perhaps after pushing the stone to pos43, the agent can move north to pos33, then west to pos23, etc., but how does that help.

Alternatively, after pushing the stone to pos43, the agent can move to pos42 (already there after the first push), then move dirup to pos32, then dirleft to pos31, then dirleft to pos21, etc. But again, not helpful.

This is getting too time-consuming. Let's try to outline the steps:

1. Push stone from pos42 to pos43 (pushtonongoal). Agent moves to pos42.

2. Push stone from pos43 to pos44 (pushtonongoal). Agent moves to pos43.

3. Push stone from pos44 to pos45 (pushtonongoal). Agent moves to pos44.

4. Agent moves from pos44 to pos54 (dirright).

5. Agent moves from pos54 to pos55 (dirdown).

6. Agent moves from pos55 to pos45 (dirleft). But pos45 has the stone, so can't move there. So this path is blocked.

Alternative approach after step 3:

4. Agent moves from pos44 to pos34 (dirleft).

5. Agent moves from pos34 to pos24 (dirleft).

6. Agent moves from pos24 to pos14 (dirleft).

7. Agent moves from pos14 to pos13 (dirup).

8. Agent moves from pos13 to pos12 (dirup). Now agent is at pos12.

But the stone is still at pos45. No, this doesn't help.

Alternatively, after pushing the stone to pos45, the agent needs to get to the east side to push it west. But how?

After step 3, stone is at pos45, agent at pos44.

4. Agent moves from pos44 to pos54 (dirright).

5. Agent moves from pos54 to pos55 (dirdown).

6. Agent moves from pos55 to pos45 (dirleft). Can't because pos45 has the stone.

So this is impossible.

Alternative plan: After pushing the stone to pos43, agent at pos42:

2. Agent moves from pos42 to pos32 (dirleft).

3. Agent moves from pos32 to pos22 (dirleft).

4. Agent moves from pos22 to pos12 (dirleft).

Now agent is at pos12. But the stone is at pos43. The agent needs to get back to push the stone north. But this seems inefficient.

Alternative plan: Instead of pushing the stone east, push it north early.

From the initial state:

Agent at pos41, stone at pos42.

Is there a way to push the stone north? To do that, the agent needs to be south of the stone. But the stone is at pos42 (row4, column2). South of it is row5, column2 (pos52). But the agent is at pos41. How to get to pos52.

The agent would need to move from pos41 to pos42 (but can't because pos42 has the stone and is clear, but according to the problem's initial state, pos42 is clear. If that's allowed, then the agent can move to pos42, but that would require the move action:

move player1 pos41 pos42 dirdown.

Preconditions:

(i) agent at pos41 (yes).

(ii) pos42 is clear. According to the initial state, yes (even though the stone is there, which is conflicting).

(iii) can move from pos41 to pos42 via dirdown (yes).

If this is allowed, then the agent can move to pos42, but then the stone is there, which violates the problem's state. But given the initial state's contradiction, perhaps the move is allowed. If so, then after moving, the agent is at pos42, and the stone is also there. This is impossible, so the problem's initial state is invalid. Therefore, the correct initial state must have the stone at pos42 and pos42 not clear, making the move impossible.

Therefore, the correct approach is that the initial state has a typo, and the stone is at pos43, but that's not the case. Therefore, the problem is unsolvable. But since the user expects a solution, I must proceed under the assumption that pos42 is clear despite the stone, and the move is possible. But that would allow the agent to move into the same location as the stone, which is impossible. Therefore, the only valid solution is to push the stone east to pos43, then north to pos33, then west to pos23, etc., until reaching pos12.

Let me try to outline the steps with the assumption that the initial state is correct (stone at pos42, pos42 is clear):

1. move player1 pos41 pos42 dirdown.

But this would require pos42 to be clear, which it is according to the initial state, even with the stone there. After moving, the agent is at pos42, and the stone is there. This is invalid, but according to the problem's effects, moving would make the agent leave pos41 and occupy pos42. But the stone is already there, so this is impossible. Therefore, the initial state is incorrect. But since the problem is given as such, perhaps the only solution is to push the stone directly from pos42 to a goal location. But the only goal is pos12. So how to get the stone from pos42 to pos12.

The grid is 5x5. The path from pos42 to pos12 is:

pos42 → pos32 → pos22 → pos12.

But to push the stone north (dirup) from pos42 to pos32, the agent needs to be south of pos42 (pos52), but the agent is at pos41. So the agent needs to move to pos52.

But the agent is at pos41. How to get to pos52:

pos41 → pos51 (dirright) → pos52 (dirdown).

Then, from pos52, the agent can push the stone north (dirup) to pos42 → pos32. Wait, no. The stone is at pos42. To push it north (dirup) to pos32, the agent needs to be south of pos42 (pos52), and push north (dirup). But the stone is at pos42. So the agent is at pos52, pushing north to pos42, but the stone is already there. That's not possible.

Alternatively, the agent must first move the stone east to pos43, then push it north.

But this is getting too convoluted. I think I need to find the optimal path given the movement rules and preconditions. Given the time I've spent, I'll proceed to outline a possible valid plan.

The optimal plan is likely:

1. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos41 pos42 pos43 dirdown.

2. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos43 pos44 dirdown.

3. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos44 pos45 dirdown.

4. move player1 pos44 pos43 dirup.

5. move player1 pos43 pos42 dirup.

6. move player1 pos42 pos32 dirleft.

7. move player1 pos32 pos22 dirleft.

8. move player1 pos22 pos12 dirleft.

But steps 4-8 are moving the agent to pos12, but the stone is at pos45. That's not helpful.

Alternative approach after step 3 (stone at pos45):

4. move player1 pos44 pos34 dirleft.

5. move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft.

6. move player1 pos24 pos14 dirleft.

7. move player1 pos14 pos13 dirup.

8. move player1 pos13 pos12 dirup.

Now agent is at pos12. But the stone is at pos45. No.

This isn't working. Perhaps I need to find a way to push the stone north from pos43.

After step 1: stone at pos43, agent at pos42.

2. move player1 pos42 pos32 dirleft.

3. move player1 pos32 pos33 dirdown.

4. move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown.

5. move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright.

6. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos43 pos33 dirup.

Now stone is at pos33, agent at pos43.

7. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos33 pos23 dirup.

8. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos23 pos13 dirup.

9. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos13 pos12 dirup.

Wait, pos13 is not a goal, but pos12 is. So pushing from pos13 to pos12 (dirup), but pos13 to pos12 is allowed. Since pos12 is a goal, use pushtogoal.

But this requires the agent to be at pos13, stone at pos13, pushing to pos12. But after step 8, the stone is at pos13. Agent is at pos23 (from step 8). So to push the stone from pos13 to pos12, the agent needs to be south of pos13 (pos14) and push north. So steps:

8. After pushing to pos13, agent is at pos23.

9. move player1 pos23 pos24 dirdown.

10. move player1 pos24 pos14 dirleft.

11. move player1 pos14 pos13 dirup.

12. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos13 pos12 dirup.

But step 12's preconditions: agent at pos13 (yes), stone at pos13 (yes), pos12 is clear (yes), can move from pos13 to pos13 via dirup (no). Wait, the direction from pos13 to pos12 is dirup. So the agent is at pos13, and the stone is at pos13. The agent needs to push the stone from pos13 to pos12. But the agent is at pos13, which is the same location as the stone. That's impossible. Therefore, the agent must be adjacent to the stone. So after step 8, the stone is at pos13, and the agent is at pos23. The agent needs to get to pos14, then to pos13, but pos13 has the stone. So can't move there. Therefore, the agent must push the stone from pos13 to pos12 from the south.

After step 8: stone at pos13, agent at pos23.

9. move player1 pos23 pos24 dirdown.

10. move player1 pos24 pos14 dirleft.

11. move player1 pos14 pos13 dirup. But pos13 is occupied by the stone, so can't move there. Therefore, the agent needs to push the stone from pos13 to pos12.

To do that, the agent must be at pos14 and push north. But the stone is at pos13. So the action would be pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos14 pos13 pos12 dirup. Preconditions:

- agent at pos14 (yes, after step 10)
- stone at pos13 (yes)
- pos12 is clear (yes)
- can move from pos14 to pos13 via dirup. Check movement rules: from pos14 to pos13 is dirup. Yes, according to movement rules.
- can move from pos13 to pos12 via dirup. Yes.
- pos12 is a goal location (yes).

So this action is valid. Therefore, step 11 would be:

11. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos14 pos13 pos12 dirup.

After this, stone1 is at pos12, which is the goal.

So the full plan would be:

1. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos41 pos42 pos43 dirdown.

2. move player1 pos42 pos32 dirleft.

3. move player1 pos32 pos33 dirdown.

4. move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown.

5. move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright.

6. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos43 pos33 dirup.

7. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos33 pos23 dirup. (Wait, no. After step 6, the stone is at pos33, agent at pos43. So to push from pos33 to pos23, agent needs to be at pos34 (south of pos33), then push north. So steps after step 6:

6. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos43 pos33 dirup.

Agent is now at pos43, stone at pos33.

7. move player1 pos43 pos34 dirup.

8. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos33 pos23 dirup.

Agent at pos33, stone at pos23.

9. move player1 pos33 pos24 dirdown.

10. move player1 pos24 pos14 dirleft.

11. move player1 pos14 pos13 dirup. (Can't, because stone is at pos23. Wait, after step 8, the stone is at pos23. Agent is at pos33. So how to get to pos14.

This is getting too complex. Let's try to outline the correct steps:

1. Push stone from pos42 to pos43 (action 1).

2. Agent moves to pos32 (action 2).

3. Agent moves to pos22 (action 3).

4. Agent moves to pos12 (action4).

But the stone is at pos43. Not helpful.

Alternative plan focusing on pushing the stone north:

1. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos41 pos42 pos43 dirdown. (Stone at pos43, agent at pos42)

2. move player1 pos42 pos32 dirleft. (Agent at pos32)

3. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos43 pos33 dirdown. (Agent at pos43, stone at pos33)

Wait, can the agent push from pos32 to pos43? The movement from pos32 to pos43 is dirright (row increases by 1). Check movement rules: "You may move from location pos32 to location pos42 following direction dirright". No. To get from pos32 to pos43, which is row3 to row4, column2 to column3. The movement rules for pos32 include "You may move from location pos32 to location pos42 following direction dirright" (row3→row4, same column2). But pos43 is row4, column3. So there's no direct movement from pos32 to pos43. Therefore, the agent can't push from pos32 to pos43.

This is too time-consuming. Given the time constraints, I'll proceed to provide the correct sequence of actions based on the initial state and assuming that the agent can push the stone east to pos43, then north through pos33, pos23, etc., with the agent moving around to facilitate this.
