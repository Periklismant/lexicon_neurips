Let's start by understanding the problem. We have a 2D grid of 5x5 locations labeled as pos11, pos12, ..., pos55. We need to move the agent (player1) to push a stone (stone1) onto a goal location. The only goal location is pos12.

Initially, the agent (player1) is at pos41, and the stone (stone1) is at pos42. The agent can move to adjacent positions and push the stone towards a goal or non-goal position.

Let's visualize the grid with initial positions (assuming 1-indexed, where pos11 is the top-left and pos55 is the bottom-right):

```
pos11 pos12(G) pos13 pos14 pos15
pos21 pos22    pos23 pos24 pos25
pos31 pos32    pos33 pos34 pos35
pos41 pos42(S) pos43 pos44 pos45
pos51 pos52    pos53 pos54 pos55
```

Where 'G' marks the goal position and 'S' marks the stone position. The agent is at pos41.

There seems to be an inconsistency in the initial state description: It says "player1 is at location pos41" and "stone1 is at location pos42", but it also says "Location pos41 is clear" and "Location pos42 is clear". Locations can't be clear if they contain an agent or a stone. This is a contradiction.

Since the task is to move the stone to a goal location, I'll assume that the first statements are correct: the agent is at pos41 and the stone is at pos42.

To reach the goal (pos12), we need to push the stone from pos42 to pos12. The stone can only be pushed in one of the four directions (up, down, left, right). 

The current layout looks like this:
```
    pos11 pos12(G) pos13 pos14 pos15
    pos21 pos22    pos23 pos24 pos25
    pos31 pos32    pos33 pos34 pos35
(P) pos41 pos42(S) pos43 pos44 pos45
    pos51 pos52    pos53 pos54 pos55
```

Here's a possible plan:
1. First, I need to get the agent into a position where it can push the stone. Since the stone is at pos42, the agent (which is at pos41) needs to go to a position adjacent to the stone, which might be pos32, pos52, or pos43. Let's say the agent goes to pos43.
2. From pos43, the agent can push the stone from pos42 to pos32 (moving it up).
3. Now the stone is at pos32, and we want to get it to pos12. We'll need to push it leftwards and upwards.

Let's work through this step by step:

1. Move the agent from pos41 to pos43.
2. Push the stone from pos42 to pos32 (via the agent at pos43).
3. Move the agent to pos31.
4. Push the stone from pos32 to pos22 (via the agent at pos31).
5. Move the agent to pos21.
6. Push the stone from pos22 to pos12 (via the agent at pos21).

Now let's construct the exact actions for these steps:

1. move player1 pos41 pos51 dirright
2. move player1 pos51 pos52 dirdown
3. move player1 pos52 pos53 dirdown
4. move player1 pos53 pos43 dirleft
5. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos42 pos32 dirleft
6. move player1 pos42 pos41 dirup
7. move player1 pos41 pos31 dirleft
8. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos32 pos22 dirleft
9. move player1 pos32 pos22 dirleft
10. move player1 pos22 pos21 dirup
11. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos21 pos22 pos12 dirleft

But wait, there's a mistake in this plan. After pushing the stone, the agent would be at the stone's previous position, not at its own previous position. Let me revise:

1. move player1 pos41 pos51 dirright
2. move player1 pos51 pos52 dirdown
3. move player1 pos52 pos53 dirdown
4. move player1 pos53 pos43 dirleft
5. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos42 pos32 dirleft
   (After this action, the agent is at pos42 and the stone is at pos32)
6. move player1 pos42 pos41 dirup
7. move player1 pos41 pos31 dirleft
8. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos32 pos22 dirleft
   (After this action, the agent is at pos32 and the stone is at pos22)
9. move player1 pos32 pos31 dirup
10. move player1 pos31 pos21 dirleft
11. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos21 pos22 pos12 dirleft
    (After this action, the agent is at pos22 and the stone is at pos12, which is the goal)

But hm, now I've noticed an apparent inconsistency in the problem description. The domain says we can only move from one location to another if there's a directional connection between them. The problem lists these connections, and they seem to have a consistent pattern: you can move to adjacent positions. But looking more carefully at the list, I notice that the directions seem to be reversed from what I would intuitively expect.

For example, "You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright" suggests that pos21 is to the right of pos11. But if we're using a 1-indexed grid where the first digit is the row and the second digit is the column, then pos21 would be below pos11, not to the right.

So, let me reinterpret the grid to understand the directions correctly. Let's look at one example:
"You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright"

If pos11 is (1,1) and pos21 is (2,1), then dirright would mean moving down, which is counterintuitive. Let's assume instead that the first digit is the column and the second digit is the row. Then pos11 is (1,1), pos21 is (2,1), and dirright makes sense.

Alright, so reinterpreting the grid:

```
    pos11 pos21 pos31 pos41 pos51
    pos12 pos22 pos32 pos42 pos52
    pos13 pos23 pos33 pos43 pos53
    pos14 pos24 pos34 pos44 pos54
    pos15 pos25 pos35 pos45 pos55
```

Wait, I'm still confused. Let's look at another example:
"You may move from location pos11 to location pos12 following direction dirdown"

This implies that pos12 is below pos11. If pos11 is (1,1) and pos12 is (1,2), then dirdown makes sense if the second digit represents the row.

Let's examine a few more to get clarity:
"You may move from location pos12 to location pos22 following direction dirright"
This suggests pos22 is to the right of pos12. If pos12 is (1,2) and pos22 is (2,2), then dirright makes sense if the first digit represents the column.

"You may move from location pos12 to location pos11 following direction dirup"
This implies pos11 is above pos12. If pos12 is (1,2) and pos11 is (1,1), then dirup makes sense if the second digit represents the row.

So it seems the grid should be interpreted as follows:

```
    pos11 pos21 pos31 pos41 pos51
    pos12 pos22 pos32 pos42 pos52
    pos13 pos23 pos33 pos43 pos53
    pos14 pos24 pos34 pos44 pos54
    pos15 pos25 pos35 pos45 pos55
```

Where the first digit is the column and the second digit is the row.

Given this reinterpretation, the agent is at pos41 (4th column, 1st row) and the stone is at pos42 (4th column, 2nd row). The goal is at pos12 (1st column, 2nd row).

Let me replan with this understanding.

Initially:
```
(P) ---- ---- ----
(S) ---- ---- ----
---- ---- ---- ----
---- ---- ---- ----
---- ---- ---- ----
```

where (P) is at pos41, (S) is at pos42, and (G) is at pos12.

Let's trace a path from pos42 to pos12. One possible path is to push the stone from pos42 to pos32, then to pos22, and finally to pos12. To push the stone from pos42 to pos32, the agent needs to be at pos42 with the stone at pos32, and the agent needs to push from right to left (i.e. the agent should be to the right of the stone). Similarly for the other pushes.

Here's a revised plan:

1. move player1 pos41 pos31 dirleft (agent moves to the left)
2. move player1 pos31 pos32 dirdown (agent moves down)
3. move player1 pos32 pos33 dirdown (agent moves down)
4. move player1 pos33 pos43 dirright (agent moves to the right)
5. move player1 pos43 pos42 dirup (agent moves up)
6. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos42 pos32 dirleft (agent pushes the stone from pos42 to pos32)
7. move player1 pos32 pos22 dirleft (agent moves to the left)
8. move player1 pos22 pos23 dirdown (agent moves down)
9. move player1 pos23 pos33 dirright (agent moves to the right)
10. move player1 pos33 pos32 dirup (agent moves up)
11. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos32 pos22 dirleft (agent pushes the stone from pos32 to pos22)
12. move player1 pos22 pos12 dirleft (agent moves to the left)
13. move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown (agent moves down)
14. move player1 pos13 pos23 dirright (agent moves to the right)
15. move player1 pos23 pos22 dirup (agent moves up)
16. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos22 pos12 dirleft (agent pushes the stone from pos22 to pos12)

Wait, there's a logical problem with this plan. If the stone is at pos42, and the agent is at pos42, they can't be at the same location. Let me reread the problem statement carefully to understand the actions and their preconditions and effects.

From the problem description, it seems like the `pushtonongoal` and `pushtogoal` actions require the agent to be at an adjacent position to the stone, and then push the stone. After the action, the agent would be at the stone's original position, and the stone would be at its new position. So I've been misinterpreting how the pushing mechanics work.

For clarity, let's denote the agent's position as L_p, the stone's current position as L_from, and the stone's desired position as L_to. The preconditions for pushing (both to goal and to non-goal) state that the agent should be at L_p, the stone at L_from, and you can move from L_p to L_from following a direction d.

So, reinterpreting the initial state: the agent is at pos41, and the stone is at pos42. This means the agent is to the left of the stone (if the first digit is the column). The agent can push the stone from the left, meaning the stone would move right, which would be from pos42 to pos52. But we want the stone to go to pos12, which is to the left.

To push the stone leftwards, the agent needs to be to the right of the stone.

Let's revise the plan once again:

1. move player1 pos41 pos31 dirleft (agent moves left from pos41 to pos31)
2. move player1 pos31 pos32 dirdown (agent moves down from pos31 to pos32)
3. move player1 pos32 pos33 dirdown (agent moves down from pos32 to pos33)
4. move player1 pos33 pos43 dirright (agent moves right from pos33 to pos43)
5. move player1 pos43 pos53 dirright (agent moves right from pos43 to pos53)
6. move player1 pos53 pos52 dirup (agent moves up from pos53 to pos52)
7. move player1 pos52 pos42 dirleft (agent moves left from pos52 to pos42)

Actually there seems to be a misunderstanding in my previous reasoning. Let's clarify by examining the `pushtonongoal` preconditions: the agent should be at L_p, the stone at L_from, and you can get from L_p to L_from following a direction d. This means the agent should be adjacent to the stone, in such a position that if the agent moves in direction d, it would reach the stone.

So, for example, if the stone is at pos42 and the agent wants to push it left (towards pos32), the agent should be at pos52 (to the right of the stone), and the pushing direction should be dirleft.

Let's revisit the grid and replan:

```
pos11 pos21 pos31 (P)  pos51
(G)  pos22 pos32 (S)  pos52
pos13 pos23 pos33 pos43 pos53
pos14 pos24 pos34 pos44 pos54
pos15 pos25 pos35 pos45 pos55
```

Here, (P) is at pos41, (S) is at pos42, and (G) is at pos12 (the goal).

We want to push the stone from pos42 to pos12, which would require pushing it left and then up. Let's trace a possible path:

1. Move the agent to pos52.
2. Push the stone from pos42 to pos32 (using the agent at pos52 and pushing left).
3. Move the agent to pos33.
4. Push the stone from pos32 to pos22 (using the agent at pos33 and pushing up).
5. Move the agent to pos13.
6. Push the stone from pos22 to pos12 (using the agent at pos13 and pushing up).

Now, let's refine this with the exact actions:

1. move player1 pos41 pos51 dirright (agent moves from pos41 to pos51)
2. move player1 pos51 pos52 dirdown (agent moves from pos51 to pos52)
3. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos52 pos42 pos32 dirleft (agent pushes stone from pos42 to pos32)
4. move player1 pos42 pos43 dirdown (agent moves from pos42 to pos43)
5. move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft (agent moves from pos43 to pos33)
6. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos32 pos22 dirup (agent pushes stone from pos32 to pos22)
7. move player1 pos32 pos33 dirdown (agent moves from pos32 to pos33)
8. move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft (agent moves from pos33 to pos23)
9. move player1 pos23 pos13 dirleft (agent moves from pos23 to pos13)
10. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos22 pos12 dirup (agent pushes stone from pos22 to pos12)

Hmm, I'm still a bit uncertain about the pushing mechanism. Let's be more detailed and check the pushtogoal and pushtonongoal actions thoroughly:

- `pushtonongoal p s l_p l_from l_to d`: Make agent p, situated at location l_p, push stone s from location l_from to non-goal location l_to, following direction d.

  Preconditions: (i) agent p is at location l_p, (ii) stone s is at location l_from, (iii) location l_to is clear, (iv) you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d, (v) you can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d, and (vi) location l_to is not a goal location.

So for the action `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos52 pos42 pos32 dirleft`:
- player1 is at pos52.
- stone1 is at pos42.
- pos32 is clear.
- The agent can get from pos52 to pos42 following dirleft.
- The agent can get from pos42 to pos32 following dirleft.
- pos32 is not a goal location.

After the action, the effects are:
- player1 is no longer at pos52.
- stone1 is no longer at pos42.
- pos32 is no longer clear.
- player1 is at pos42.
- stone1 is at pos32.
- pos52 is clear.
- stone1 is at a non-goal state.

So, if this action is successful, after the action, the agent will be at pos42 and the stone will be at pos32. This seems aligned with our plan.

Let's verify the rest of the actions in the plan to ensure they satisfy all preconditions and results:

1. move player1 pos41 pos51 dirright:
   - player1 is at pos41.
   - pos51 is clear.
   - You can move from pos41 to pos51 following dirright.
   After the action, player1 is at pos51 and pos41 is clear.

2. move player1 pos51 pos52 dirdown:
   - player1 is at pos51.
   - pos52 is clear.
   - You can move from pos51 to pos52 following dirdown.
   After the action, player1 is at pos52 and pos51 is clear.

3. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos52 pos42 pos32 dirleft:
   - player1 is at pos52.
   - stone1 is at pos42.
   - pos32 is clear.
   - You can move from pos52 to pos42 following dirleft.
   - You can move from pos42 to pos32 following dirleft.
   - pos32 is not a goal location.
   After the action, player1 is at pos42, stone1 is at pos32, and pos52 is clear.

4. move player1 pos42 pos43 dirdown:
   - player1 is at pos42.
   - pos43 is clear.
   - You can move from pos42 to pos43 following dirdown.
   After the action, player1 is at pos43 and pos42 is clear.

5. move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft:
   - player1 is at pos43.
   - pos33 is clear.
   - You can move from pos43 to pos33 following dirleft.
   After the action, player1 is at pos33 and pos43 is clear.

6. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos32 pos22 dirup:
   - player1 is at pos33.
   - stone1 is at pos32.
   - pos22 is clear.
   - You can move from pos33 to pos32 following dirup.
   - You can move from pos32 to pos22 following dirup.
   - pos22 is not a goal location.
   After the action, player1 is at pos32, stone1 is at pos22, and pos33 is clear.

7. move player1 pos32 pos33 dirdown:
   - player1 is at pos32.
   - pos33 is clear.
   - You can move from pos32 to pos33 following dirdown.
   After the action, player1 is at pos33 and pos32 is clear.

8. move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft:
   - player1 is at pos33.
   - pos23 is clear.
   - You can move from pos33 to pos23 following dirleft.
   After the action, player1 is at pos23 and pos33 is clear.

9. move player1 pos23 pos13 dirleft:
   - player1 is at pos23.
   - pos13 is clear.
   - You can move from pos23 to pos13 following dirleft.
   After the action, player1 is at pos13 and pos23 is clear.

10. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos22 pos12 dirup:
    - player1 is at pos13.
    - stone1 is at pos22.
    - pos12 is clear.
    - You can move from pos13 to pos22 following dirup.
    - You can move from pos22 to pos12 following dirup.
    - pos12 is a goal location.
    After the action, player1 is at pos22, stone1 is at pos12, and pos13 is clear. stone1 is at a goal location.

But wait, there's a problem with action 10. The precondition for pushing the stone from pos22 to pos12 is that you can move from pos13 to pos22 following dirup. However, looking at the available moves:
"You may move from location pos13 to location pos23 following direction dirright"
"You may move from location pos13 to location pos12 following direction dirup"
"You may move from location pos13 to location pos14 following direction dirdown"

We can't move from pos13 to pos22 following dirup. This means the pushing action from pos13 can't be done directly.

Let's adjust the plan:

10. move player1 pos13 pos12 dirup (agent moves from pos13 to pos12)
11. move player1 pos12 pos22 dirright (agent moves from pos12 to pos22)
12. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos22 pos12 dirleft (agent pushes stone from pos22 to pos12)

Wait, that doesn't work either, because after step 11, both the agent and the stone are at pos22, which is a contradiction. Let's rethink the last part of the plan.

From pos13, the agent can move to pos12, pos23, or pos14. The stone is at pos22. To push the stone to pos12, the agent needs to be at a position such that it can push the stone in the right direction. Given the available moves, the agent can be at pos23 and push the stone up from pos22 to pos12.

10. move player1 pos13 pos23 dirright (agent moves from pos13 to pos23)
11. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos22 pos12 dirup (agent pushes stone from pos22 to pos12)

Ok ok let's just replan one last time to make sure it makes sense:

1. move player1 pos41 pos51 dirright (agent moves from pos41 to pos51)
2. move player1 pos51 pos52 dirdown (agent moves from pos51 to pos52)
3. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos52 pos42 pos32 dirleft (agent pushes stone from pos42 to pos32)
4. move player1 pos42 pos43 dirdown (agent moves from pos42 to pos43)
5. move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft (agent moves from pos43 to pos33)
6. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos32 pos22 dirup (agent pushes stone from pos32 to pos22)
7. move player1 pos32 pos33 dirdown (agent moves from pos32 to pos33)
8. move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft (agent moves from pos33 to pos23)
9. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos22 pos12 dirup (agent pushes stone from pos22 to pos12)

This plan seems to work, and it's pretty direct. Let's trace through it:

Starting position:
```
pos11 pos21 pos31 (P)  pos51
(G)  pos22 pos32 (S)  pos52
pos13 pos23 pos33 pos43 pos53
pos14 pos24 pos34 pos44 pos54
pos15 pos25 pos35 pos45 pos55
```

After action 1:
```
pos11 pos21 pos31 ---- (P)
(G)  pos22 pos32 (S)  pos52
pos13 pos23 pos33 pos43 pos53
pos14 pos24 pos34 pos44 pos54
pos15 pos25 pos35 pos45 pos55
```

After action 2:
```
pos11 pos21 pos31 ---- pos51
(G)  pos22 pos32 (S)  (P)
pos13 pos23 pos33 pos43 pos53
pos14 pos24 pos34 pos44 pos54
pos15 pos25 pos35 pos45 pos55
```

After action 3:
```
pos11 pos21 pos31 ---- pos51
(G)  pos22 (S)  (P)  ----
pos13 pos23 pos33 pos43 pos53
pos14 pos24 pos34 pos44 pos54
pos15 pos25 pos35 pos45 pos55
```

After action 4:
```
pos11 pos21 pos31 ---- pos51
(G)  pos22 (S)  ---- ----
pos13 pos23 pos33 (P)  pos53
pos14 pos24 pos34 pos44 pos54
pos15 pos25 pos35 pos45 pos55
```

After action 5:
```
pos11 pos21 pos31 ---- pos51
(G)  pos22 (S)  ---- ----
pos13 pos23 (P)  ---- pos53
pos14 pos24 pos34 pos44 pos54
pos15 pos25 pos35 pos45 pos55
```

After action 6:
```
pos11 pos21 ---- ---- pos51
(G)  (S)  (P)  ---- ----
pos13 pos23 ---- ---- pos53
pos14 pos24 pos34 pos44 pos54
pos15 pos25 pos35 pos45 pos55
```

After action 7:
```
pos11 pos21 ---- ---- pos51
(G)  (S)  ---- ---- ----
pos13 pos23 (P)  ---- pos53
pos14 pos24 pos34 pos44 pos54
pos15 pos25 pos35 pos45 pos55
```

After action 8:
```
pos11 pos21 ---- ---- pos51
(G)  (S)  ---- ---- ----
pos13 (P)  ---- ---- pos53
pos14 pos24 pos34 pos44 pos54
pos15 pos25 pos35 pos45 pos55
```

After action 9:
```
pos11 pos21 ---- ---- pos51
(S)  (P)  ---- ---- ----
pos13 ---- ---- ---- pos53
pos14 pos24 pos34 pos44 pos54
pos15 pos25 pos35 pos45 pos55
```

Wait, that doesn't work, because the stone (S) was pushed to pos12, which is the goal (G). So the final state is:

```
pos11 pos21 ---- ---- pos51
(G,S)  (P)  ---- ---- ----
pos13 ---- ---- ---- pos53
pos14 pos24 pos34 pos44 pos54
pos15 pos25 pos35 pos45 pos55
```

Yeah, this works! The stone is at the goal location.

Actually let me review the plan (and starting/ending states) one more time, to be triply sure:

Starting position:
- player1 is at pos41
- stone1 is at pos42
- pos12 is the goal
- The grid is 5x5, and positions are denoted as posXY, where X is the column and Y is the row.

Desired end position:
- stone1 is at pos12 (the goal)

The plan:
1. move player1 pos41 pos51 dirright (agent moves from pos41 to pos51)
2. move player1 pos51 pos52 dirdown (agent moves from pos51 to pos52)
3. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos52 pos42 pos32 dirleft (agent pushes stone from pos42 to pos32)
4. move player1 pos42 pos43 dirdown (agent moves from pos42 to pos43)
5. move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft (agent moves from pos43 to pos33)
6. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos32 pos22 dirup (agent pushes stone from pos32 to pos22)
7. move player1 pos32 pos33 dirdown (agent moves from pos32 to pos33)
8. move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft (agent moves from pos33 to pos23)
9. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos22 pos12 dirup (agent pushes stone from pos22 to pos12)

Final position:
- stone1 is at pos12 (the goal)
- player1 is at pos22

This plan seems optimal to me. It moves the stone directly from its starting position to the goal with no unnecessary actions.

Here's the list of all actions:
1. move player1 pos41 pos51 dirright
2. move player1 pos51 pos52 dirdown
3. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos52 pos42 pos32 dirleft
4. move player1 pos42 pos43 dirdown
5. move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft
6. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos32 pos22 dirup
7. move player1 pos32 pos33 dirdown

9. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos22 pos12 dirup

Actually, there's one more thing that just occurred to me: in the initial state description, it says "Location pos41 is clear" and "Location pos42 is clear", but it also says "player1 is at location pos41" and "stone1 is at location pos42". This seems contradictory.

But the directions of the problem seem to be consistent, and there's a well-defined goal location (pos12) which makes sense in the context. So, I'll proceed with the plan under the assumption that pos41 and pos42 are indeed occupied by the agent and the stone, respectively.

Let's check if there are any shorter paths. The stone takes 3 steps to reach the goal (from pos42 to pos32, then to pos22, then to pos12). Given that the stone can only move by being pushed by the agent, and the agent starts at pos41, this seems like the minimal number of pushes required. The other actions in the plan are just the agent repositioning itself to push the stone in the right direction, which also seems minimal. Thus, the plan seems optimal.

So my final plan is:
1. move player1 pos41 pos51 dirright
2. move player1 pos51 pos52 dirdown
3. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos52 pos42 pos32 dirleft
4. move player1 pos42 pos43 dirdown
5. move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft
6. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos32 pos22 dirup
7. move player1 pos32 pos33 dirdown
8. move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft
9. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos22 pos12 dirup
