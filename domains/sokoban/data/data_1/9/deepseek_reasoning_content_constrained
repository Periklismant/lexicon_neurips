Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. Hmm, the goal is to get stone1 to a goal location. The only goal location mentioned is pos55. So I need to move stone1 from pos44 to pos55. But there are constraints. Let me check the constraints first.

The first constraint says that at some point, pos34 must not be clear. That means either the agent or a stone must be there. The second constraint is that if pos34 is not clear in some state, then there must have been a previous state where pos33 was not clear. So pos33 needs to be occupied before pos34 is occupied.

Wait, the initial state has the agent at pos43 and stone1 at pos44. Let me visualize the grid. The locations are pos11 to pos55, forming a 5x5 grid. pos55 is the goal. The agent starts at pos43 (row 4, column 3), stone1 is at pos44 (row4, column4). The goal is to get stone1 to pos55 (row5, column5).

So to move the stone to pos55, the agent needs to push it. Let's think about the possible moves. The agent can move around, but to push the stone, they need to be adjacent to it. From pos44, the stone can be pushed right to pos54 (since direction dirright from pos44 to pos54?), but wait, the movement directions might be a bit different. Let me check the movement possibilities.

Looking at the allowed moves: For example, from pos44, the possible moves are to pos34 (dirleft), pos54 (dirright), pos43 (dirup), and pos45 (dirdown). Wait, but according to the "may move" statements, pos44 can go to pos34 via dirleft, to pos54 via dirright, to pos43 via dirup, and to pos45 via dirdown.

So stone1 is at pos44. To push it to pos54 (which is a non-goal location), then from there to pos55 (a goal location). But pos55 is a goal, so the final push should be using pushtogoal. But first, the agent needs to get next to the stone.

Initially, the agent is at pos43. The stone is at pos44. So the agent is directly left of the stone. If the agent is at pos43, and the stone is at pos44, the agent can push the stone down (dirdown) to pos45, but pos45 is not a goal. Alternatively, push right (dirright) to pos54. Wait, but pushing the stone requires the agent to be at a position adjacent in the direction of the push.

Wait, the pushtogoal action requires that the agent is at l_p, which is adjacent to l_from (the stone's current position) in direction d. So to push the stone from pos44 to pos54 (dirright), the agent needs to be at pos44's left (pos43) and move right. Wait, but according to the movement directions, moving from pos43 to pos44 is via dirdown? Let me check the allowed moves.

Looking at the movement for pos43: "You may move from location pos43 to location pos33 following direction dirleft", "You may move from location pos43 to location pos53 following direction dirright", "You may move from location pos43 to location pos42 following direction dirup", "You may move from location pos43 to location pos44 following direction dirdown".

Ah, so from pos43, moving down (dirdown) leads to pos44. So the agent is at pos43, and can move down to pos44, but pos44 is occupied by the stone. Wait, no, the initial state says "Location pos44 is clear" but the stone is at pos44. Wait, wait. The original state says "stone1 is at location pos44" and "Location pos44 is clear". Wait, that can't be. If the stone is at pos44, then pos44 is not clear. But according to the initial state, "Location pos44 is clear". Hmm, that's a contradiction. Wait, maybe there's a mistake here. Let me check again.

Looking back at the original state:

"player1 is at location pos43"

"stone1 is at location pos44"

Then under the clear locations, it lists "Location pos44 is clear". Wait, that's conflicting. Because if a stone is at pos44, that location shouldn't be clear. But according to the problem description, in the original state, both the agent and the stone are at their positions, but the locations are marked as clear. That might be a mistake, but perhaps in the problem's setup, a location is considered clear if it doesn't have a stone or the agent? Wait, the problem says "Each position on the grid may contain either the agent, a stone or be empty." So a location is clear if it's empty. So if a stone or the agent is there, it's not clear. But according to the original state, pos43 is where the agent is, so it's not clear. But in the list of clear locations, pos43 is listed as clear. That's contradictory. Wait, maybe the initial state is written incorrectly. Let me check again.

Original state:

The original state says:

"player1 is at location pos43"

"stone1 is at location pos44"

"Location pos43 is clear"

"Location pos44 is clear"

Wait, that's impossible. If player1 is at pos43, then pos43 is not clear. Similarly, stone1 is at pos44, so pos44 is not clear. So this must be an error in the problem description. But assuming that the problem is correct as given, maybe the "clear" status is separate from the presence of the agent or stone. Or perhaps "clear" refers to being passable. But according to the problem statement, each position may contain the agent, a stone, or be empty. So when the problem lists "Location pos43 is clear", that's conflicting with the agent being there. This must be a mistake. However, given that the problem states this, perhaps the correct approach is to proceed under the given initial state, even if there's an inconsistency. Maybe "clear" here refers to something else, like the presence of another stone? Or perhaps the problem has a typo. But given that the user has presented the problem this way, I need to work with it as is.

Alternatively, perhaps "clear" refers to the absence of stones. Wait, the problem says "each position may contain either the agent, a stone or be empty". So when a location is clear, it's empty. So if the agent is at pos43, then pos43 is not clear. Similarly, if the stone is at pos44, then pos44 is not clear. So the initial state lists "Location pos43 is clear" and "Location pos44 is clear", which contradicts the agent and stone being there. This must be an error. But perhaps in the problem, the initial state's clear list is incorrect. Maybe the user intended that some locations are clear except where the agent and stone are. But given that, perhaps the problem's initial state is correct in that, for example, the agent and stone are present, but the locations are still considered clear. That would be inconsistent with the problem's own definitions, but maybe the user made a mistake. However, as the solver, I need to proceed with the given information.

Alternatively, maybe "clear" means that there are no obstacles other than the agent or stones. But the problem statement says "each position may contain either the agent, a stone or be empty". So a location is clear if it's empty. Therefore, the initial state is contradictory. This is a problem. But perhaps the user made a mistake in listing the clear locations, and the actual initial state is that pos43 is not clear (due to the agent) and pos44 is not clear (due to the stone). The problem says "Location pos43 is clear" and "Location pos44 is clear" in the original state. But according to the agent and stone positions, they shouldn't be. This is a problem. Maybe the user meant that initially, the agent is at pos43, and the stone is at pos44, and the other locations are as listed. But then the clear statuses for pos43 and pos44 are wrong. However, I need to proceed as per the given problem, even if there's an inconsistency. So perhaps, in this problem, the agent and stones don't block the locations? That can't be. Because the move action requires the destination to be clear, which would imply that the agent's current location is not clear. So this seems contradictory.

This is confusing. Maybe there's a misunderstanding in the problem's setup. Let me re-examine the problem's original state statements:

Original state:

- "player1 is at location pos43"

- "stone1 is at location pos44"

Then under the list of clear locations:

"Location pos43 is clear"

"Location pos44 is clear"

But according to the problem's definitions, if a location contains the agent or a stone, it's not clear. So this is conflicting. Therefore, there's an error in the problem's setup. However, as a solver, perhaps I should proceed under the assumption that despite the agent and stone being present, those locations are considered clear. But that would make the preconditions of actions not work as intended. For example, the move action requires the destination to be clear. If the agent is at pos43, but pos43 is considered clear, then another agent could move there, but there's only one agent. Alternatively, maybe "clear" means that there are no stones, and the agent's presence doesn't affect it. But the problem's action effects mention that after moving, the agent leaves the previous location clear. So when the agent moves from l_from to l_to, l_from becomes clear. So the presence of the agent affects the clearness. Therefore, the initial state's clear list is wrong. This is a major issue.

But since this is an exam problem, perhaps the user intended that the initial clear locations are as listed, and the agent and stone are present. So in that case, the agent is at pos43, but pos43 is clear. Which would mean that another agent could move there, but there's only one agent. This seems contradictory, but perhaps the problem is designed this way. Therefore, I need to proceed with the given information, even if it's inconsistent.

But given that, when the agent is at pos43, and pos43 is clear, that's a problem. But maybe the clear status is separate from the presence of the agent and stones. Maybe "clear" refers to the absence of obstacles other than the agent and stones. But that's not how the problem defines it. According to the problem, each position can be occupied by agent, stone, or empty. So a location is clear if it's empty. Therefore, in the initial state, pos43 and pos44 are not clear because they have the agent and stone. But the problem states they are clear. This is a contradiction. But perhaps it's a typo, and the correct initial state is that pos43 is not clear (due to the agent) and pos44 is not clear (due to the stone). Let's assume that the problem intended that, and the clear list is incorrect. Then, the actual initial clear locations exclude pos43 and pos44. But how can I proceed? Maybe the user made a mistake, but I need to work with what's given.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different definition where "clear" means that a stone is not present. So the agent's presence doesn't affect the clearness. Then, in the initial state, pos43 is clear (no stone) even though the agent is there. But the move action's preconditions require the destination to be clear. So if the agent is moving to a location, it must be clear (i.e., no stone), but the agent can be there. That doesn't make sense. Because when the agent moves to a location, it would no longer be clear. So this seems inconsistent.

This is a significant problem. Without knowing the correct initial state, it's hard to proceed. But given the problem as stated, perhaps I should proceed under the assumption that the initial state has the agent at pos43 and stone at pos44, and the clear locations are as listed, even though that's contradictory. Therefore, pos43 and pos44 are clear (no stones or agents), but the agent and stone are somehow there. Which doesn't make sense. So maybe the problem has a typo in the initial state. Let's try to see if the user intended that the agent is at pos43, and stone is at pos44, and the clear locations are pos43 and pos44. But that's impossible. Alternatively, maybe the agent is at pos43, and the stone is at pos44, and the clear locations exclude those two. Let me check the original state's list of clear locations:

The original state lists "Location pos43 is clear" and "Location pos44 is clear" but also states the agent and stone are there. So this is conflicting. Therefore, this must be a mistake in the problem's setup. To resolve this, perhaps the correct initial clear locations do not include pos43 and pos44. Let me check the list again:

Looking at the original state's clear locations:

"Location pos11 is clear" ... (many others) ... "Location pos45 is clear", "pos51" to "pos55" are clear except for pos55, which is a goal. Then, "Location pos43 is clear" and "Location pos44 is clear". But the agent is at pos43 and stone1 is at pos44. So according to the problem's definitions, these locations are not clear. Therefore, the problem's initial state has an error. However, as a solver, I need to proceed with the given information, perhaps considering that the agent and stone are present but the locations are still considered clear. Which would mean that the agent can move into a location even if it's occupied by another agent (but there's only one agent). This is impossible. Therefore, this is a problem.

Given this inconsistency, perhaps the intended initial state is that pos43 and pos44 are not clear. So the correct clear locations exclude pos43 and pos44. Therefore, when the agent is at pos43, pos43 is not clear, and stone1 at pos44 makes pos44 not clear. So the list of clear locations provided in the problem is incorrect. But without clarification, I need to proceed with the given data.

Assuming that the initial state is correctly specified, despite the contradiction, perhaps the agent and stone are at their positions, and the clear locations are as listed. So pos43 and pos44 are clear, which would allow the agent to move into pos43 again (but it's already there). This is impossible. So this is a paradox.

Alternatively, perhaps the "clear" in the initial state is a typo. Maybe the original state should not list pos43 and pos44 as clear. Let's check the original state again:

The original state says:

"Location pos43 is clear"

"Location pos44 is clear"

But also:

"player1 is at location pos43"

"stone1 is at location pos44"

Therefore, this must be a mistake. But as a solver, I need to proceed with the given data, even if it's conflicting. Therefore, perhaps the initial state is that the agent and stone are at their respective positions, and the locations are not clear. So the clear list is wrong. Therefore, when planning, the agent cannot move to pos43 or pos44 because they are occupied. Therefore, the initial state's clear locations should not include pos43 and pos44. But according to the problem, they do. So this is a problem.

Alternatively, maybe the problem's clear list is correct, and the presence of the agent and stone doesn't affect the clearness. Then, the agent can move into a location even if it's already occupied. But the move action's precondition is that the destination is clear. So if pos43 is clear, but the agent is there, that would allow another agent to move there, but there's only one agent. Therefore, this is confusing.

This is a major issue. However, given that the problem states the clear locations include pos43 and pos44, and the agent and stone are there, I'll have to proceed under the assumption that in this problem, the presence of the agent or stone does not make the location non-clear. Which contradicts the problem's own action effects. For example, the move action's effect is that the destination is no longer clear. So if the agent moves to a location, it becomes non-clear. But according to the initial state, pos43 is clear even with the agent there. This is conflicting.

But perhaps the problem's definition of "clear" is different. Maybe "clear" refers to the absence of stones, and the agent's presence is separate. So a location is clear if there's no stone, regardless of the agent. Then, the agent can move to any clear location (no stone) even if another agent is there. But there's only one agent. However, this is not standard. But given the problem's contradiction, this might be the intended approach.

If that's the case, then the initial state's clear locations are correct. The agent is at pos43, which is clear (no stone), and stone1 is at pos44, which is clear (but how?). Wait, no. If a stone is present, the location is not clear. But according to the initial state, pos44 is clear despite having the stone. So this is impossible under standard definitions. Therefore, the problem's initial state is flawed. But I need to proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps "clear" means that the location is accessible, i.e., not blocked by walls. But the problem's description doesn't mention walls. So that's unlikely.

Given the confusion, perhaps the best approach is to proceed under the assumption that the initial state has the agent at pos43 and stone at pos44, and that the clear locations are as listed, but the agent and stone's presence does not affect the clear status. Therefore, the agent can move into pos44 even though the stone is there, but according to the action preconditions, "move p l_from l_to d" requires that the destination is clear. So if the destination is pos44, which is listed as clear, but has the stone, this is a contradiction. Therefore, the only way to resolve this is to assume that the clear list in the initial state is incorrect, and pos43 and pos44 are not clear.

Therefore, the agent is at pos43 (so pos43 is not clear), and stone1 is at pos44 (so pos44 is not clear). The clear locations are as listed except pos43 and pos44. But the problem says pos43 and pos44 are clear, which must be a mistake.

Assuming that, then the initial state's clear list is incorrect, and pos43 and pos44 are not clear. Therefore, the agent is at pos43 (not clear), stone at pos44 (not clear). Other locations are as listed.

Now, the problem's constraints require that at some state, pos34 is not clear (so either the agent or stone is there), and if pos34 is not clear, then pos33 must have been not clear in a prior state.

So the plan must include moving the agent or a stone to pos34, but before that, pos33 must have been occupied.

The goal is to get stone1 to a goal location (pos55). The constraints require that during the plan, pos34 is occupied at some point, and pos33 was occupied before that.

Let's try to devise a plan that meets these constraints.

First, the agent needs to push stone1 to pos55. The initial positions are agent at pos43, stone1 at pos44. To push the stone to pos54 (right), the agent needs to be at pos44's left (pos43) and push it right. But pos43 is the agent's current position. So perhaps the agent can push the stone right from pos44 to pos54 using pushtonongoal (since pos54 is not a goal), and then push it down to pos55 using pushtogoal. But let's see.

But first, the agent is at pos43. The stone is at pos44. The agent can push the stone down (dirdown) to pos45, but pos45 is not a goal. Or push right to pos54. But to push right, the agent needs to be to the left of the stone. Wait, to push the stone right (dirright), the agent must be at pos44's left (pos43) and push it right. So the action would be pushtonongoal (since pos54 is not a goal) with direction dirright. Let's see:

Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos44 pos54 dirright.

But let's check the preconditions:

(i) agent player1 is at pos43: yes.

(ii) stone1 is at pos44: yes.

(iii) pos54 is clear: according to initial state, pos54 is clear.

(iv) can move from pos43 to pos44 following dirright: Wait, the direction for moving from pos43 to pos44 is dirdown. Because according to the allowed moves, from pos43, moving dirdown leads to pos44. Because in the movement list: "You may move from location pos43 to location pos44 following direction dirdown".

So the direction from pos43 to pos44 is dirdown, not dirright. Therefore, to push the stone from pos44 to pos54 (dirright), the agent needs to be adjacent to pos44 in the direction of the push. To push right, the agent needs to be on the left side of the stone. But the agent is at pos43, which is to the left of pos44. So the direction from pos43 to pos44 is dirdown (since pos43 is row4, column3, pos44 is row4, column4. Wait, wait, maybe the coordinates are row-major. Wait, pos11 is (1,1), pos12 is (1,2), ..., pos15 (1,5), pos21 (2,1), etc. So pos43 is row4, column3, pos44 is row4, column4. So to move from pos43 to pos44, it's to the right, but the allowed moves for pos43 say "You may move from location pos43 to location pos44 following direction dirdown". Wait, that's confusing. So moving from pos43 to pos44 is dirdown? That would imply that pos43 is (4,3) and pos44 is (5,3)? Or maybe the coordinates are (row, column) where row increases down and column increases right. So pos43 is row4, column3, pos44 is row4, column4. So moving right from pos43 would be to pos44. But according to the allowed moves, from pos43, moving dirright is to pos53. Because "You may move from location pos43 to location pos53 following direction dirright". And moving dirdown from pos43 leads to pos44. Wait, that makes sense. So pos43 (row4, column3) moving dirright (east) would be to pos53 (row5, column3). No, that can't be. Wait, perhaps the directions are defined differently. Let me check the movement list:

For example, "You may move from location pos43 to location pos33 following direction dirleft". pos33 is row3, column3. So dirleft from pos43 is up to pos33. Then dirright from pos43 is to pos53 (row5, column3). So directions are dirup, dirdown, dirleft, dirright correspond to north, south, west, east. Wait, but that would make pos43 moving dirright (east) to pos44? No. Because pos43 is row4, column3. East would be column4, same row. So pos44 is row4, column4. But according to the movement list, moving dirright from pos43 leads to pos53. That's row5, column3. So that must mean that dirright is south. Because pos53 is directly below pos43. Wait, this is very confusing. The directions are named dirup, dirdown, dirleft, dirright, but their actual movement might be in the grid. Let me look at the movement directions in the problem.

For example, the first movement is "You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright". pos11 to pos21 is down one row (from row1 to row2), same column. So dirright corresponds to moving down. Then "You may move from location pos11 to location pos12 following direction dirdown". pos11 to pos12 is column increase by 1, same row. So dirdown corresponds to moving right. Wait, this is conflicting. So in the problem, the directions are named in a way that dirright corresponds to moving down (south), and dirdown corresponds to moving right (east). That's counterintuitive but possible.

Let me clarify the directions based on the movement examples:

- From pos11 (row1, column1), moving dirright takes you to pos21 (row2, column1). So dirright is south.

- From pos11, moving dirdown takes you to pos12 (row1, column2). So dirdown is east.

- dirleft would be north (opposite of dirright), and dirup would be west (opposite of dirdown). Wait, but let's check another example.

From pos12, moving dirright takes you to pos22 (row2, column2). So dirright is south.

From pos12, moving dirup (opposite of dirdown) takes you to pos11. Since pos12 to pos11 is west (column decreases by 1). So dirup is west.

Similarly, from pos12, moving dirdown (east) takes you to pos13.

So the directions are as follows:

- dirright: south (row increases by 1)

- dirleft: north (row decreases by 1)

- dirdown: east (column increases by 1)

- dirup: west (column decreases by 1)

This is the mapping based on the movement examples. So the directions are named in a way that might be counterintuitive. So moving dirright is south, dirleft is north, dirdown is east, dirup is west.

Therefore, in this grid:

- Rows increase southward.

- Columns increase eastward.

So pos43 is row4, column3. Moving dirright (south) would take you to row5, column3: pos53. Moving dirdown (east) would take you to row4, column4: pos44. Moving dirleft (north) to pos33 (row3, column3). Moving dirup (west) to pos42 (row4, column2).

This is crucial for understanding the movement directions.

Now, the agent is at pos43. To push the stone at pos44 (east of the agent), the agent needs to be adjacent in the direction of the push. So to push the stone east (dirdown direction), the agent needs to be west of the stone (pos44's west is pos43). So the agent is at pos43, which is west of the stone. So the agent can push the stone east (dirdown) to pos45 (row4, column5), but wait, pos44's east is pos45 (row4, column5). But according to the movement list, from pos44, moving dirdown (east) leads to pos45. So yes.

Wait, the stone is at pos44. To push it east (dirdown direction) to pos45, the agent must be at pos43 (west of the stone). So the action would be pushtonongoal, since pos45 is not a goal location.

But wait, the problem says the only goal location is pos55. So pushing the stone to pos45 is not a goal. Then, from pos45, pushing it dirright (south) to pos55 (row5, column5), which is a goal. So the agent would need to be south of pos45 to push it dirright (south) to pos55. Wait, no. To push the stone south (dirright), the agent needs to be north of the stone. So if the stone is at pos45, the agent needs to be at pos44 (north of pos45) to push it south. But pos44 is now clear (after pushing the stone to pos45). Wait, this requires several steps.

But let's think step by step.

Initial positions:

Agent at pos43 (row4, column3)

Stone1 at pos44 (row4, column4)

Goal location is pos55 (row5, column5)

Constraints:

- At some point, pos34 is not clear (so agent or stone must be there)

- If pos34 is not clear, then pos33 was not clear earlier.

Approach:

First, get the stone to pos55. To do that, the agent needs to push it east to pos45, then south to pos55. But that would require moving the agent around. Alternatively, push the stone south from pos44 to pos54 (row5, column4), then east to pos55. Let's see.

Option 1:

1. Push stone1 from pos44 to pos54 (south, dirright). But the agent needs to be north of the stone (pos44's north is pos34) to push it south. But the agent is initially at pos43 (row4, column3). To get to pos34 (row3, column4), the agent needs to move there. So steps:

a. Move agent from pos43 to pos44 (dirdown east) – but pos44 is occupied by the stone. Wait, no. The agent can't move into a location occupied by a stone unless pushing it. So the agent needs to move around to reach pos34.

Wait, the agent is at pos43. To reach pos34, which is row3, column4. Let's plan the agent's path.

From pos43, the agent can move dirleft (north) to pos33 (row3, column3), then dirdown (east) to pos34 (row3, column4). So:

Action: move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft

Preconditions: agent is at pos43, pos33 is clear. In the initial state, pos33 is clear (as per the original state's clear list, but assuming pos33 is clear). After moving, the agent is at pos33.

Then, move from pos33 to pos34 via dirdown (east). So:

Action: move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown

Preconditions: pos34 is clear. According to the original state, pos34 is clear. So this is allowed.

Now the agent is at pos34. Now, to push the stone from pos44 to pos54 (dirright/south), the agent needs to be north of the stone. The stone is at pos44 (row4, column4), and the agent is at pos34 (row3, column4). So the agent is directly north of the stone. So the agent can push the stone south (dirright) to pos54.

Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos44 pos54 dirright.

Preconditions:

- Agent is at pos34: yes.

- Stone at pos44: yes.

- pos54 is clear: yes.

- Can move from pos34 to pos44 via dirright (south): Check the allowed moves. From pos34, is there a move to pos44 following dirright? Looking at the movement list: "You may move from location pos34 to location pos44 following direction dirright". Yes. So this is allowed.

- Can move from pos44 to pos54 via dirright: Check if pos44 to pos54 is allowed. The movement list says: "You may move from location pos44 to location pos54 following direction dirright". Yes.

- pos54 is not a goal: Correct, since pos55 is the only goal.

Effects: Agent moves to pos44, stone moves to pos54. pos34 becomes clear, pos44 now has the agent, pos54 has the stone.

Now, the stone is at pos54. Next, push it to pos55 (south, dirright). Since pos55 is a goal, we need to use pushtogoal.

To push from pos54 to pos55 (dirright/south), the agent needs to be north of the stone (pos54's north is pos44). So the agent is currently at pos44. To push the stone south, the agent must be at pos54's north (pos44). Wait, pos54 is row5, column4. Its north is pos44 (row4, column4). So the agent is already at pos44. So the action would be:

Action: pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos54 pos55 dirright.

Preconditions:

- Agent is at pos44: yes.

- Stone at pos54: yes.

- pos55 is clear: yes.

- Can move from pos44 to pos54 via dirright (south). Check allowed moves: pos44 can move to pos54 via dirright. Yes.

- Can move from pos54 to pos55 via dirright: Check. pos54's dirright is south to pos55. From the movement list: "You may move from location pos54 to location pos55 following direction dirdown". Wait, no. Because the movement from pos54 to pos55 is via dirdown (east). Wait, according to the movement list:

"You may move from location pos54 to location pos55 following direction dirdown".

Wait, pos54 is row5, column4. dirdown is east (column increases by 1). So pos54 to pos55 (row5, column5) via dirdown (east). Therefore, to push the stone from pos54 to pos55, the direction is dirdown (east), not dirright (south). So the agent needs to be west of the stone (pos54's west is pos53) to push it east (dirdown).

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let's clarify:

The stone is at pos54 (row5, column4). To push it east (dirdown) to pos55 (row5, column5), the agent must be at pos54's west (pos53). So the agent needs to move to pos53.

Current agent position after pushing to pos54 is pos44. To get to pos53, the agent needs to move from pos44 to pos54 (dirright/south), but pos54 has the stone. So cannot move there. Alternative path: agent at pos44 can move east (dirdown) to pos45. Then from pos45, move dirright (south) to pos55? Wait, no. Let's see:

Agent is at pos44. Can move dirdown (east) to pos45. Then from pos45, move dirright (south) to pos55. But pos45's dirright is south to pos55 (row5, column5). But according to movement list: "You may move from location pos45 to location pos55 following direction dirright". Yes. So agent can move from pos45 to pos55 via dirright. But pos55 is clear. So after pushing the stone to pos54, the agent is at pos44. Then:

Action: move player1 pos44 pos45 dirdown.

Preconditions: pos45 is clear. Initially, pos45 is clear. After pushing the stone to pos54, pos45 is clear. So this is allowed.

Now agent is at pos45. Then:

Action: move player1 pos45 pos55 dirright.

Preconditions: pos55 is clear. Initially, yes. So the agent moves to pos55.

Now agent is at pos55. To push the stone from pos54 to pos55, the agent needs to be west of pos54 (pos53) and push east (dirdown). So the agent needs to get to pos53.

From pos55, the agent can move dirup (west) to pos54. But pos54 has the stone. So can't move there. Alternatively, move dirleft (north) to pos45. Then from pos45, move dirup (west) to pos44. Then move dirleft (north) to pos34. Then move dirup (west) to pos33. Then move dirdown (east) to pos43. Then move dirdown (east) to pos44. But this is getting too long. Alternatively, after agent is at pos55, move dirleft (north) to pos45, then dirup (west) to pos44, then dirleft (north) to pos34, then dirup (west) to pos33, etc. This seems inefficient.

Alternatively, after pushing the stone to pos54, the agent is at pos44. Instead of moving to pos45, maybe find another path. From pos44, the agent can move dirleft (north) to pos34, then dirup (west) to pos33, then dirdown (east) to pos43, then dirdown (east) to pos44 again. Wait, but this doesn't help.

This is getting complicated. Perhaps there's a more efficient way. Let's think differently.

Alternative plan:

1. Move agent from pos43 to pos33 (dirleft).

2. Move agent from pos33 to pos34 (dirdown).

3. Push stone from pos44 to pos54 (dirright), which moves agent to pos44.

4. Move agent from pos44 to pos54 (dirright) – but pos54 has the stone, so can't. Alternatively, move east (dirdown) to pos45.

5. Move agent from pos45 to pos55 (dirright).

6. Push stone from pos54 to pos55 (dirdown east) from pos54's west (pos53). So agent needs to reach pos53.

But how? From pos55, agent can move dirup (west) to pos54 (stone is there, blocked). So maybe after step 3, agent is at pos44. Then move east (dirdown) to pos45, then south (dirright) to pos55. Then from pos55, move dirup (west) to pos54, but can't. So this approach might not work.

Alternative approach after step 3:

Agent is at pos44. The stone is at pos54. To push it to pos55, the agent needs to be at pos54's west (pos53). How to get there?

From pos44, the agent can move dirleft (north) to pos34, then dirup (west) to pos33, then dirright (south) to pos43, then dirdown (east) to pos44 again. Not helpful.

Alternatively, agent at pos44 can move dirdown (east) to pos45, then dirright (south) to pos55. Then from pos55, move dirup (west) to pos54 (stone is there). Can't.

Alternatively, agent at pos44 moves dirright (south) to pos54 (stone is there). Can't.

Hmm. So pushing the stone from pos54 to pos55 requires the agent to be at pos53 (west of pos54). So how to get the agent to pos53.

After step 3, agent is at pos44. Let's plan a path from pos44 to pos53.

Possible path:

pos44 → pos43 (dirup west), then pos43 → pos53 (dirright south). Wait, from pos43, dirright (south) is to pos53. So:

Agent at pos44 can move dirup (west) to pos43. Then dirright (south) to pos53.

But moving from pos44 to pos43 requires that pos43 is clear. After step 3, when the agent is at pos44, pos43 is clear (since after pushing, the agent leaves pos34 and moves to pos44, making pos34 clear, but pos43 was cleared when the agent moved from pos43 to pos33 earlier. Wait, no. Let's retrace:

Initial agent at pos43.

Step 1: move to pos33 (dirleft). So pos43 becomes clear.

Step 2: move to pos34 (dirdown). So pos33 becomes clear, pos34 is now occupied.

Step 3: push stone from pos44 to pos54, agent moves to pos44. So pos34 becomes clear, pos44 is now occupied.

So after step 3, pos43 is clear, pos44 has agent, pos54 has stone.

So agent is at pos44. To move west (dirup) to pos43: allowed, since pos43 is clear.

Action: move player1 pos44 pos43 dirup.

Then from pos43, dirright (south) to pos53.

Action: move player1 pos43 pos53 dirright.

Now agent is at pos53. Then push the stone from pos54 to pos55 (dirdown east):

Action: pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos53 pos54 pos55 dirdown.

Preconditions:

- Agent at pos53: yes.

- Stone at pos54: yes.

- pos55 is clear: yes.

- Can move from pos53 to pos54 via dirdown (east). Check allowed moves: "You may move from location pos53 to location pos54 following direction dirdown". Yes.

- Can move from pos54 to pos55 via dirdown (east). Yes.

- pos55 is a goal: yes.

So this action is valid. Effects: agent moves to pos54, stone to pos55. Now the goal is achieved.

But we need to check the constraints. The constraints require that pos34 is not clear at some state, and that pos33 was not clear before that.

In this plan:

After step 2, agent is at pos34. So pos34 is not clear. Then, before that, in step 1, agent moved to pos33. So pos33 was not clear during step 1. So pos33 was occupied (agent was there) before pos34 was occupied. This satisfies the constraint that if pos34 is not clear, then pos33 was not clear earlier.

Therefore, this plan meets the constraints.

Let's summarize the steps:

1. move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft

2. move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown

3. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos44 pos54 dirright

4. move player1 pos44 pos43 dirup

5. move player1 pos43 pos53 dirright

6. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos53 pos54 pos55 dirdown

Now check if each action's preconditions are met.

Step 1: move from pos43 to pos33 dirleft. Pre: agent at pos43 (yes), pos33 clear (yes), movement allowed (yes).

Step 2: move from pos33 to pos34 dirdown. Pre: agent at pos33 (yes), pos34 clear (yes), movement allowed (yes).

Step 3: push stone1 from pos44 to pos54. Agent at pos34 (yes), stone at pos44 (yes), pos54 clear (yes), can move from pos34 to pos44 via dirright (south) (yes), can move from pos44 to pos54 via dirright (south) (yes), pos54 is not a goal (yes).

After this action, agent is at pos44, stone at pos54.

Step 4: move from pos44 to pos43 dirup (west). Pre: agent at pos44 (yes), pos43 clear (yes), movement allowed (yes) (from pos44, dirup is west to pos43? Looking at the allowed moves for pos44: "You may move from location pos44 to location pos43 following direction dirup". Yes.

Step 5: move from pos43 to pos53 dirright (south). Pre: agent at pos43 (yes), pos53 clear (yes), movement allowed (yes) (from pos43 to pos53 via dirright).

Step 6: push stone1 from pos54 to pos55 dirdown (east). Pre: agent at pos53 (yes), stone at pos54 (yes), pos55 clear (yes), can move from pos53 to pos54 via dirdown (yes), can move from pos54 to pos55 via dirdown (yes), pos55 is a goal (yes).

This plan meets all preconditions and effects. It also satisfies the constraints: pos34 was occupied in step 2, and pos33 was occupied in step 1 before that.

But is this the optimal plan? Let's count the steps: 6 actions. Can we find a shorter plan?

Alternative approach:

Can the agent push the stone directly from pos44 to pos54 without moving to pos34? For that, the agent needs to be north of pos44 (pos34) to push it south (dirright). So the agent must first move to pos34. Which is what the previous plan does. So steps 1 and 2 are necessary to get to pos34.

Alternatively, is there a way to push the stone to pos54 without going through pos34?

Alternatively, after moving to pos34 and pushing the stone to pos54, perhaps there's a shorter path. But the steps seem necessary.

Wait, perhaps after pushing the stone to pos54, the agent can directly move to pos54's west (pos53) without going back to pos43. But after pushing to pos54, the agent is at pos44. From pos44, can the agent move directly to pos53? Let's see:

From pos44, possible moves: dirleft (north) to pos34, dirup (west) to pos43, dirdown (east) to pos45, dirright (south) to pos54 (blocked by stone). So the agent can't move south to pos54. So the agent must go west to pos43, then south to pos53. Which is steps 4 and 5 in the previous plan.

Another idea: after pushing to pos54, the agent is at pos44. From pos44, move east (dirdown) to pos45, then south (dirright) to pos55. Then from pos55, move west (dirup) to pos54 (blocked by stone). No, can't. So this doesn't help.

So the previous plan seems optimal with 6 steps. But let's see if there's a way to reduce steps.

Alternative plan:

1. move player1 pos43 pos44 dirdown (east) – but pos44 is occupied by the stone. So this is invalid. Can't.

So no.

Another idea: agent moves to pos34 first, then pushes the stone to pos54, then pushes it to pos55 without needing to move around as much.

But how?

After step 3 (stone at pos54, agent at pos44):

Agent at pos44. To get to pos53, the agent can move west to pos43, then south to pos53. So that's two moves. Then push to pos55. Total steps: 6.

Is there a way to push the stone from pos54 to pos55 in fewer steps?

For example, after pushing to pos54, can the agent move from pos44 to pos54 directly? No, because pos54 has the stone.

Another approach: after pushing the stone to pos54, the agent is at pos44. Then move east to pos45, then south to pos55. Then from pos55, move west to pos54 (blocked). No.

So the previous plan seems optimal with 6 steps. Are there any steps that can be merged or skipped?

Wait, after step 3, the agent is at pos44. Can the agent push the stone from pos54 to pos55 from pos44? No, because to push east (dirdown) from pos54 to pos55, the agent must be at pos54's west (pos53). So the agent needs to get to pos53.

So steps 4 and 5 are necessary.

Alternative idea: after step 3, agent is at pos44. Then move east (dirdown) to pos45, then south (dirright) to pos55. Then move west (dirup) to pos54, but it's blocked. So that's not helpful.

Thus, the plan with 6 steps seems optimal.

Now, check the constraints:

- pos34 must be not clear in some state: step 2, agent is at pos34.

- Before that, pos33 was not clear in step 1.

So the constraints are satisfied.

Therefore, this plan is valid and optimal.
