Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. The goal is to get stone1 to a goal location. The only goal location mentioned is pos55. So, stone1 is currently at pos44, and the agent (player1) is at pos43.

First, I need to figure out how to move the stone from pos44 to pos55. Let me look at the grid connections. 

Starting from pos44, the possible moves are to pos34 (left), pos54 (right), pos43 (up), or pos45 (down). But since pos55 is the goal, I need to see if there's a path from pos44 to pos55. Let's see: pos44 can go right to pos54, then pos54 can go down to pos55. So the path is pos44 → pos54 → pos55. 

But to push the stone, the agent needs to be adjacent to it. Right now, the agent is at pos43. The stone is at pos44. So the agent is directly above the stone. From pos43, moving down would take the agent to pos44, but that's where the stone is. Wait, but can the agent push the stone? Let's check the action preconditions.

The agent can push the stone if they are in a position adjacent to the stone and the direction allows pushing. Since the agent is at pos43, which is up from pos44, to push the stone down (from the stone's perspective, which would be the same direction as the agent moving down), the stone would move to pos45 (down from pos44). But pos45 is not a goal. Alternatively, pushing the stone right (from pos44 to pos54) would require the agent to be to the left of the stone. The agent is at pos43, which is up, not left. So maybe the agent needs to move around.

Wait, the stone is at pos44. To push it right to pos54, the agent needs to be on the left side of the stone. The left side of pos44 is pos34. So the agent would need to be at pos34 to push the stone right to pos54. But currently, the agent is at pos43. How to get to pos34?

Looking at the movement possibilities. Let's see the connections. From pos43, the agent can move left to pos33, up to pos42, or right to pos53, or down to pos44 (but that's where the stone is, which is occupied). Wait, the initial state says pos43 is clear. Wait, the original state says "player1 is at location pos43" and "Location pos43 is clear". Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no: the original state says "player1 is at location pos43", which means pos43 is occupied by the agent. But the "Location pos43 is clear" is listed, but that's conflicting. Wait, looking back at the original state:

The original state includes:
- "player1 is at location pos43"
- "stone1 is at location pos44"
- "Location pos43 is clear"
Wait, that's a contradiction. Because if the player is at pos43, then pos43 is not clear. Hmm, maybe there's a mistake here. Wait, let me check again.

In the original state, under "The original state of the world is the following", there's a line "Location pos43 is clear". But the player is at pos43. So that's conflicting. But according to the problem's description, each position can contain either the agent, a stone, or be empty. So if the agent is at pos43, then pos43 is not clear. But the problem states that pos43 is clear. That must be an error. Or perhaps the problem uses "clear" to mean that there's no stone, but the agent can be there? Wait, the problem says each position may contain either the agent, a stone, or be empty. So "clear" probably means that neither the agent nor a stone is there. But in that case, the original state has a contradiction. However, looking at the original state lines:

The original state includes:
"player1 is at location pos43"
"stone1 is at location pos44"
Then, in the list of "Location ... is clear", it includes "Location pos43 is clear" and "Location pos44 is clear". But that's impossible because the player is at pos43 and the stone is at pos44, so those locations shouldn't be clear. This must be a mistake in the problem statement. Or perhaps the "clear" refers to something else. Wait, maybe the problem's initial state is correct, and "clear" means that there's no stone, but the agent's presence doesn't affect the "clear" status. That would be inconsistent with the action preconditions, though. For example, the move action requires the destination to be clear. But if the agent is moving to a location, then that location must be clear (i.e., no agent or stone there). So in the initial state, pos43 has the agent, so it's not clear. But the problem says "Location pos43 is clear". This is conflicting. This must be an error in the problem setup.

But assuming that the problem's initial state is correctly specified, perhaps the "clear" refers to the presence of stones only. That is, a location is clear if there's no stone. The agent's presence doesn't make it not clear. But that contradicts the move action's preconditions, which require the destination to be clear (which would include the agent's current position being considered as not clear if the agent is there). This is confusing. However, the problem's initial state lists "Location pos43 is clear" even though the agent is there, so perhaps in this domain, "clear" means that there's no stone. Then, the agent can be present, but the location is still considered clear if there's no stone. That would make sense. Because the move action's precondition (ii) says "location l_to is clear", meaning no stone is there, but the agent can move there even if another agent is there? Wait, but there's only one agent here (player1). So maybe "clear" means that the location is free of stones. Then, when the agent moves, the destination just needs to not have a stone. The presence of the agent is handled separately. That could be possible.

But the problem's action effects for "move" state that after moving, the agent leaves the previous location and the new location is no longer clear. Wait, no: the effect (ii) of "move" is "location l_to is no longer clear", which would imply that the agent's presence makes the location not clear. But if "clear" refers to the absence of stones, then moving the agent shouldn't affect the clear status. This is a contradiction. Therefore, I think there's a mistake in the problem statement's initial state. Alternatively, perhaps "clear" means that the location is empty (no agent, no stone). Then, the agent's presence makes it not clear. So in the initial state, pos43 is occupied by the agent, so it's not clear, but the problem says "Location pos43 is clear". That's a problem.

This is a critical issue because it affects the planning. Let me check the original state again carefully. The original state lists:

"player1 is at location pos43"
"stone1 is at location pos44"
Then, under the "Location ... is clear" statements, it includes "Location pos43 is clear" and "Location pos44 is clear". But according to the problem's description, a location can contain the agent, a stone, or be empty. So if the agent is at pos43, then pos43 is not clear. Similarly, pos44 has the stone, so it's not clear. Therefore, the initial state is contradictory. This must be an error in the problem setup. However, since the user provided this, I have to proceed with the given information, assuming that perhaps "clear" refers to something else. Alternatively, maybe the initial state is correct, and the "clear" status is separate from the presence of the agent or stone. But that would mean that a location can have an agent and be clear, which contradicts the action preconditions.

This is a significant problem. Since the user has provided the problem, perhaps the correct approach is to proceed under the assumption that the initial state is correct as given, even if there's an inconsistency. So, according to the initial state, pos43 is clear (no stone) and has the agent. Similarly, pos44 has the stone and is clear (no agent). But that's impossible. Therefore, there's a mistake here. Perhaps the line "Location pos43 is clear" and "Location pos44 is clear" are typos and should be "not clear". Alternatively, maybe the agent and stone are allowed to be in the same location, but that's not specified.

This is a major hurdle. Let me try to proceed by assuming that "clear" means that there's no stone. So the presence of the agent doesn't affect the "clear" status. Then, the move action's precondition (ii) is that the destination is clear (i.e., no stone there). The agent can move to a location even if another agent is there (but there's only one agent here). So in the initial state, pos43 is clear (no stone), and the agent is there. pos44 has the stone, so it's not clear. Wait, but the original state says "Location pos44 is clear". That's conflicting. Because if pos44 has the stone, then it's not clear. So this must be an error. The original state lists "stone1 is at location pos44" and "Location pos44 is clear". That's a contradiction. Therefore, the problem statement is incorrect. However, since this is part of the problem given, perhaps there's a misunderstanding. Let me check again.

Wait, the original state lists "stone1 is at location pos44" which would mean that pos44 is occupied by the stone. Then, under the "Location ... is clear" statements, it says "Location pos44 is clear", which is impossible. Therefore, this must be an error. The user may have made a mistake in the problem setup. However, since I have to work with the given information, perhaps the correct initial state is that pos44 is not clear (due to the stone), and pos43 is not clear (due to the agent). But the problem says they are clear. This is a problem.

Assuming that the problem's initial state is correct as given, despite the contradictions, I'll proceed. So pos43 is clear (no stone), and the agent is there. pos44 is clear (no stone), but the stone is there. That can't be. Therefore, this suggests that the problem's initial state has a typo. Maybe the stone is at pos44, and pos44 is not clear. But the original state says pos44 is clear. This is confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the "clear" status is separate from the presence of the agent and stone. Maybe a location is clear if it's not a goal location. But no, the problem says "Each position is flagged as either a goal position or a non-goal position". The "clear" term must refer to the presence of objects. Given the confusion, perhaps the best approach is to proceed under the assumption that the initial state is correctly specified, and that "clear" in the problem refers to the absence of stones only, not agents. Therefore, when the agent is at a location, it's still considered clear if there's no stone. But when a stone is present, the location is not clear. Then, in the initial state, pos43 is clear (no stone), and the agent is there. pos44 has the stone, so it's not clear. But the original state says "Location pos44 is clear", which contradicts that. Therefore, the problem statement is inconsistent.

Given this inconsistency, perhaps there's a mistake in the original state. For example, maybe the stone is at pos45, but it's stated as pos44. Or perhaps the clear statements for pos43 and pos44 are typos. Without further information, it's hard to proceed. However, given that the user provided this problem, I'll have to work with it as is. Let's proceed by assuming that "clear" refers to the absence of stones. So even if the agent is present, the location is considered clear if there's no stone. Therefore, in the initial state, pos43 is clear (no stone), and the agent is there. pos44 has the stone, so it's not clear. But the original state says "Location pos44 is clear", which would be incorrect. Therefore, perhaps the stone is not at pos44. But the original state says "stone1 is at location pos44". This is a contradiction.

This is a major issue. To resolve it, perhaps the correct initial state is that pos44 has the stone, making it not clear, but the problem mistakenly lists it as clear. Therefore, the correct initial state should have pos44 not clear. But since the problem states that pos44 is clear, I'm stuck.

Alternatively, maybe the problem's definition of "clear" is that a location is clear if it doesn't have an agent. But that doesn't make sense with the stone's presence. I'm really confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps "clear" means that the location is accessible, i.e., not blocked. But that's not mentioned in the problem description.

Given the time I've spent on this, perhaps I should proceed under the assumption that the initial state has a typo and that pos44 is not clear (since the stone is there). Therefore, when the agent wants to move, they can only move to locations that are clear (no stones). So the stone is at pos44 (not clear), and the agent is at pos43 (clear, as per the problem's statement). 

The goal is to get the stone to a goal location. The only goal location is pos55. So the stone needs to be moved from pos44 to pos55. 

Looking at the movement paths, the agent is at pos43. To push the stone to pos45 (down), the agent would need to be at pos44, but pos44 has the stone. Alternatively, the agent can move to pos34 (left of the stone) to push it right to pos54. Then from pos54, push it down to pos55.

But how does the agent get to pos34? Let's see the movement possibilities. The agent is at pos43. From pos43, the allowed moves are:

- "You may move from location pos43 to location pos33 following direction dirleft"
- "You may move from location pos43 to location pos53 following direction dirright"
- "You may move from location pos43 to location pos42 following direction dirup"
- "You may move from location pos43 to location pos44 following direction dirdown" (but pos44 has the stone, so it's not clear. Wait, if pos44 is not clear (because of the stone), then the agent can't move there. But according to the problem's initial state, pos44 is clear. So that's conflicting again.

But assuming pos44 is not clear (stone is there), then the agent can't move down to pos44. Therefore, the agent's possible moves from pos43 are left to pos33, right to pos53, up to pos42, or down to pos44 (but blocked by the stone). So the agent can move left, right, or up.

To get to pos34, which is left of pos44, the agent would need to go from pos43 to pos33 (left), then from pos33 to pos34 (down). Wait, pos33's connections: from pos33, you can move right to pos43, left to pos23, up to pos32, or down to pos34. So the agent can go pos43 → pos33 (dirleft), then pos33 → pos34 (dirdown). Then, the agent is at pos34. From there, they can push the stone at pos44 to the right (dirright) to pos54. Let's check the preconditions for "pushtogoal" or "pushtonongoal".

Wait, pos54 is not a goal location (the only goal is pos55). So pushing to pos54 would require using pushtonongoal. Then, from pos54, the stone can be pushed down to pos55 (which is a goal). So the steps would be:

1. Move agent from pos43 to pos33 (dirleft)
2. Move agent from pos33 to pos34 (dirdown)
3. Push stone1 from pos44 to pos54 (direction dirright) using pushtonongoal (since pos54 is not a goal)
4. Then, the agent is at pos44 after pushing. From there, move to pos54 (right) to be adjacent to the stone at pos54.
5. Push the stone from pos54 to pos55 (direction dirdown) using pushtogoal (since pos55 is a goal).

But let's check each step's preconditions.

Step 1: move from pos43 to pos33. Preconditions: agent is at pos43 (yes), pos33 is clear (yes, as per initial state), and movement from pos43 to pos33 via dirleft is allowed (yes, according to the connections). So this is valid.

After moving, pos43 becomes clear (agent leaves), and pos33 is now occupied.

Step 2: move from pos33 to pos34. Preconditions: agent is at pos33 (yes), pos34 is clear (initial state says pos34 is clear), and movement is allowed (pos33 to pos34 via dirdown). Valid.

Now agent is at pos34.

Step 3: push stone1 from pos44 to pos54. The agent is at pos34, which is to the left of pos44. The direction from pos34 to pos44 is dirright (since pos34 to pos44 is right). Then, pushing the stone from pos44 to pos54 (also dirright). The action would be pushtonongoal since pos54 is not a goal.

Preconditions for pushtonongoal:
(i) agent is at l_p (pos34) → yes.
(ii) stone is at l_from (pos44) → yes.
(iii) l_to (pos54) is clear → initial state says pos54 is clear.
(iv) can move from pos34 to pos44 (direction dirright) → according to connections: "You may move from location pos34 to location pos44 following direction dirright" (yes).
(v) can move from pos44 to pos54 (dirright) → "You may move from location pos44 to location pos54 following direction dirright" (yes).
(vi) l_to (pos54) is not a goal → correct.

So this action is valid. After this, the agent moves to pos44, stone moves to pos54. pos34 becomes clear.

Step 4: agent is now at pos44. Need to move to pos54 to push the stone to pos55. So move from pos44 to pos54 (dirright). Check if pos54 is clear. After step 3, stone is at pos54, so pos54 is not clear. Therefore, the agent cannot move there. Wait, after pushing, the stone is at pos54, making it occupied. So the agent can't move directly. So how does the agent get to pos54?

Wait, after the push action, the agent ends up at l_from (pos44). Wait, the effect of pushtonongoal is that the agent is now at l_from (pos44), which is where the stone was. So after step 3, the agent is at pos44, and the stone is at pos54. Now, to push the stone from pos54 to pos55, the agent needs to be adjacent to it. The stone is at pos54, which can be pushed down to pos55. To do that, the agent needs to be at pos54's up direction (pos54's up is pos53 or pos54's other directions? Let's check the connections.

From pos54, the allowed moves are:
- "You may move from location pos54 to location pos44 following direction dirleft"
- "You may move from location pos54 to location pos53 following direction dirup"
- "You may move from location pos54 to location pos55 following direction dirdown"

So to push the stone down to pos55, the agent needs to be at pos54's up (pos54's up is pos53? Or the direction depends on how the grid is structured. Wait, pos54 is in row 5, column 4. Directions: up would decrease the row number. So pos54's up is pos44 (row 4, column 4). Wait, no: pos44 is row 4, column4. pos54 is row5, column4. So moving up from pos54 would go to pos44. But according to the connections, moving up from pos54 goes to pos53. Wait, looking at the connections listed:

The problem states:
"You may move from location pos54 to location pos44 following direction dirleft"
"You may move from location pos54 to location pos53 following direction dirup"
"You may move from location pos54 to location pos55 following direction dirdown"

So, moving up (dirup) from pos54 leads to pos53. Therefore, to push the stone from pos54 to pos55 (dirdown), the agent needs to be at pos54's dirup position, which is pos53. Wait, no: to push the stone down (dirdown) from pos54 to pos55, the agent must be at the position opposite to the direction. So to push down, the agent must be at the north (up) side of the stone. But according to the movement directions, to push down, the agent would be at the same direction. Hmm, perhaps the agent needs to be adjacent in the direction of the push. Wait, the pushtogoal action requires that the agent is at l_p, which is adjacent to l_from (the stone's current location) in the direction d. For example, to push the stone from l_from to l_to in direction d, the agent must be at l_p, which is in the direction opposite to d from l_from.

Wait, the action "pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d" has preconditions (iv) you can get from l_p to l_from following direction d. So l_p is adjacent to l_from in direction d. So, for example, if the stone is at pos54 and needs to be pushed down (dirdown) to pos55, the agent must be at pos54's north (up) direction, which is pos53 (since moving up from pos54 leads to pos53). Wait, but according to the connections, moving up from pos54 is to pos53. So the direction from pos53 to pos54 is dirdown. Therefore, to push the stone from pos54 to pos55 (dirdown), the agent needs to be at pos54's up (pos53), and the direction from pos53 to pos54 is dirdown. Then, the action would be pushtogoal with direction dirdown.

So after step 3, the agent is at pos44. To get to pos53, the agent needs to move from pos44 to pos43 (dirup), then pos43 to pos53 (dirright). But wait:

After step 3, agent is at pos44. From pos44, possible moves are:

- dirleft to pos34
- dirright to pos54 (but pos54 has the stone, so not clear)
- dirup to pos43
- dirdown to pos45 (if clear)

But pos54 is occupied by the stone, so moving right to pos54 is not possible. So the agent can move up to pos43 (dirup), then from pos43 to pos53 (dirright). Let's check:

From pos44, moving up (dirup) to pos43 is allowed (connection exists). pos43 is clear (assuming after step 3, pos43 is clear. After step 3, the agent was at pos34, then pushed to pos44, so pos34 becomes clear, and pos44 is now occupied by the agent. So pos43 is clear. So agent can move from pos44 to pos43 (dirup). Then, from pos43 to pos53 (dirright). 

Step 4: move from pos44 to pos43 (dirup). Preconditions: agent is at pos44 (yes after step3), pos43 is clear (yes, since after step3, agent left pos43 to go to pos33, then pos34, then pos44. So pos43 was clear after step1, and remains clear). So moving to pos43 is allowed.

Then, step5: move from pos43 to pos53 (dirright). Check connections: yes, "You may move from location pos43 to location pos53 following direction dirright". pos53 is clear (initial state says pos53 is clear, and no actions have affected it yet).

Now agent is at pos53. To push the stone from pos54 to pos55, need to be at pos54's up (pos53), and direction dirdown. So the action would be pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos53 pos54 pos55 dirdown.

Check preconditions:

(i) agent is at pos53 (yes)
(ii) stone is at pos54 (yes, after step3)
(iii) pos55 is clear (initial state says pos55 is clear)
(iv) can move from pos53 to pos54 (direction dirdown) → check connections: "You may move from location pos53 to location pos54 following direction dirdown" (yes)
(v) can move from pos54 to pos55 (dirdown) → yes
(vi) pos55 is a goal → yes

So this action is valid. After this, the stone is at pos55 (goal), and the agent is at pos54.

Thus, the plan would be:

1. move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft
2. move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown
3. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos44 pos54 dirright
4. move player1 pos44 pos43 dirup
5. move player1 pos43 pos53 dirright
6. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos53 pos54 pos55 dirdown

But wait, step3 pushes the stone from pos44 to pos54, after which the agent is at pos44. Then step4 moves from pos44 to pos43. Then step5 moves from pos43 to pos53. Then step6 pushes from pos54 to pos55. 

Is there a shorter path? Let's see. After step3, the agent is at pos44. Could the agent move directly from pos44 to pos54? No, because pos54 is occupied by the stone. So they have to go around. The steps 4 and 5 are necessary to get to pos53.

Alternatively, after step3, the agent is at pos44. Could they move to pos45 (down) if pos45 is clear? pos45 is clear in the initial state. After step3, pos45 is still clear. So from pos44, the agent can move down to pos45. Then from pos45, move right to pos55? But pos55 is a goal location. Wait, pos45 can move right to pos55 via direction dirright. So:

After step3, agent is at pos44. They can move down to pos45 (dirdown). Then, from pos45, move right to pos55 (dirright). But pos55 is clear, so this is allowed. Then, the agent is at pos55. But the stone is at pos54. The agent needs to push it. But to push the stone from pos54 to pos55, the agent must be at pos54's up (pos53) or left (pos44). Wait, if the agent is at pos55, which is south of pos54, then to push the stone down to pos55, the agent would need to be north of the stone. But pos55 is south, so that's not possible. So this path doesn't help.

Therefore, the initial plan of moving up to pos43, then right to pos53 is necessary.

So the plan would be the six steps I listed. But maybe there's a shorter way. Let's think again.

Alternative approach: from the initial position, pos43, can the agent move down to pos44 (but it's blocked by the stone). No. So must go left to pos33, then down to pos34. Then push the stone right to pos54. Then, from pos44, move up to pos43, then right to pos53, then push down. That's the same as before.

Alternatively, after pushing the stone to pos54, the agent is at pos44. From there, could they move right to pos54? No, because pos54 is occupied by the stone. So they have to move up to pos43, then right to pos53.

Is there a way to combine steps? For example, after pushing to pos54, instead of moving up to pos43, maybe the agent can go another way. But I don't think so.

Therefore, the plan requires those six steps. But wait, maybe step4 and step5 can be replaced by a different path. For example, from pos44, move left to pos34, then up to pos33, then right to pos43, then right to pos53. But that's longer. So the original plan is the shortest.

Alternatively, after step3 (agent at pos44), move left to pos34, then up to pos33, then right to pos43, then right to pos53. That's four moves instead of two, which is worse.

So the original plan is six steps. But maybe there's a shorter way. Let me check again.

Initial agent position: pos43. Stone at pos44. Goal is pos55.

Alternative plan:

1. move player1 pos43 pos44 dirdown → but pos44 is occupied by the stone. Can't do that. So invalid.

Another idea: The agent can push the stone directly from pos44 to pos54 if possible. But to do that, the agent needs to be at pos34 (left of pos44). So steps to get to pos34 are necessary.

Another alternative: Can the agent move from pos43 to pos33 (left), then to pos34 (down), then push the stone to pos54 (right). Then, the agent is at pos44. Then, the agent needs to get to pos54's north (pos53) to push it down. To get to pos53, the agent can move from pos44 to pos43 (up), then to pos53 (right). Then push. So same as before.

So the six-step plan is the shortest possible.
