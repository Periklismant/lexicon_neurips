I need to solve a Sokoban-like problem where I have to move a stone to a goal location.

Let's understand the problem:

1. We have a 5x5 grid (with positions pos11 to pos55).
2. Currently, player1 is at pos43 and stone1 is at pos44.
3. The goal is to get stone1 to a goal location, which is only pos55.
4. The player can move to adjacent empty cells.
5. The player can push a stone to an adjacent empty cell.

I need to plan a sequence of actions to move stone1 from pos44 to pos55.

First, let's analyze the available actions:
- **move**: Move the agent from one location to another.
- **pushtogoal**: Push a stone to a goal location.
- **pushtonongoal**: Push a stone to a non-goal location.

Next, I'll determine the current state of the grid:
- player1 is at pos43
- stone1 is at pos44
- pos55 is the only goal location
- All other positions are clear

Now, let's plan:

1. The player is at pos43 and the stone is at pos44. The stone is to the right of the player.
2. I need to move the stone to pos55, which is below and to the right of the stone's current position.
3. One direct approach would be to push the stone from pos44 to pos54 (not a goal), then from pos54 to pos55 (goal).

So, let's see:

1. From pos43, I need to push the stone from pos44 to pos54.
   - I need to move the player to pos44's left, which is already the case.
   - I'll use `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos44 pos54 dirright` because pos54 is not a goal.

2. Now, player1 is at pos44 and stone1 is at pos54.
   - I need to move the player to pos54's up, which is pos53.
   - First, I move to pos43: `move player1 pos44 pos43 dirup`
   - Then, I move to pos53: `move player1 pos43 pos53 dirright`
   - Then, I move to pos54's up: `move player1 pos53 pos54 dirdown`

3. Now, I can push the stone from pos54 to pos55.
   - I'll use `pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos54 pos54 pos55 dirdown` because pos55 is a goal.

But wait, there's a problem with my reasoning. Let me double-check the action semantics:

For `pushtonongoal p s l_p l_from l_to d`:
(i) agent p is at location l_p
(ii) stone s is at location l_from
(iii) location l_to is clear
(iv) you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d
(v) you can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d
(vi) location l_to is not a goal location

For (iv), the agent must be able to get from l_p to l_from in direction d. This means the agent must be positioned such that pushing in direction d will move the stone. For example, if the agent is to the left of the stone and wants to push it right, then d would be dirright. If the agent is above the stone and wants to push it down, then d would be dirdown.

Given the problem state:
- player1is at pos43
- stone1 is at pos44
- pos43 is above pos44 (in the grid, row 3 column 4 is above row 4 column 4)

If the player wants to push the stone right (from pos44 to pos54), the player needs to be at pos34 (to the left of pos44). But the player is at pos43, which is above pos44. So, the player can't immediately push the stone right.

Let me analyze the grid directions again:
- pos11 is the top-left corner
- pos55 is the bottom-right corner
- "dirdown" means increasing the first coordinate (moving down the grid)
- "dirup" means decreasing the first coordinate (moving up the grid)
- "dirright" means increasing the second coordinate (moving right in the grid)
- "dirleft" means decreasing the second coordinate (moving left in the grid)

So, based on this:
- player1 is at pos43
- stone1 is at pos44
- player1 is to the left of stone1
- To push stone1 right, the player needs to be at its left, which is already the case.

Ok, let me double-check the action preconditions again:

For `pushtonongoal p s l_p l_from l_to d`:
(iv) you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d

This would mean the player is positioned such that moving in direction d would take them to the stone's position. For instance, if the player is to the left of the stone and wants to push it right, then d would be dirright because moving right from the player's position would take them to the stone's position.

I still feel like I'm missing something about the problem setup. Let me map the grid more clearly.

We have a 5x5 grid with positions labeled as pos11 to pos55. Here's the grid:

```
pos11 pos12 pos13 pos14 pos15
pos21 pos22 pos23 pos24 pos25
pos31 pos32 pos33 pos34 pos35
pos41 pos42 pos43 pos44 pos45
pos51 pos52 pos53 pos54 pos55
```

Now, let's place the agent (P) and the stone (S) on the grid:

```
. . . . .
. . . . .
. . . . .
. . P S .
. . . . .
```

Given the current state:
- player1 is at pos43
- stone1 is at pos44
- We want to move stone1 to pos55, which is the bottom-right corner.

Let's try to trace a path:

1. From the current position, the player can push the stone to the right (pos45).
   - The player is at pos43.
   - The stone is at pos44.
   - Moving right from the player takes the player to the stone's position.
   - Moving right from the stone's position would take the stone to pos45.
   - Action: `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos44 pos45 dirright`

2. After the action, the player is at pos44 and the stone is at pos45.
   ```
   . . . . .
   . . . . .
   . . . . .
   . . . P S
   . . . . .
   ```

3. Now, we want to push the stone down to pos55.
   - The player is at pos44.
   - The stone is at pos45.
   - Moving right from the player takes the player to the stone's position.
   - Moving down from the stone's position would take the stone to pos55.
   - But the player can't push directly from pos44 to pos45 in the "dirdown" direction, because pos45 is to the right of pos44, not below it.

4. So, the player needs to get below the stone to push it down. The player needs to go to pos55.
   - First, move the player down: `move player1 pos44 pos54 dirdown`
   - Then, move the player right: `move player1 pos54 pos55 dirright`
   - But wait, we can't move to pos55 because it's a goal location.

Hmm, this plan won't work. Let me try another approach.

Actuallty, I think I misunderstood the grid representation. Let's revisit:

Based on the movement directions, I think:
- pos11 is the top-left corner
- pos55 is the bottom-right corner
- First digit is the row (1-5)
- Second digit is the column (1-5)

So, `pos43` means row 4, column 3. This gives us:

```
pos11 pos12 pos13 pos14 pos15
pos21 pos22 pos23 pos24 pos25
pos31 pos32 pos33 pos34 pos35
pos41 pos42 pos43 pos44 pos45
pos51 pos52 pos53 pos54 pos55
```

And the initial state:
```
. . . . .
. . . . .
. . . . .
. . P S .
. . . . G
```

Where:
- P is player1 at pos43
- S is stone1 at pos44
- G is the goal at pos55

I want to move stone1 to the goal (pos55).

Let me map out a plan:

1. The player is at pos43 and the stone is at pos44. To push the stone right, the player needs to be to the left of the stone.
   - The player is at pos43, which is to the left of pos44.
   - Moving right from pos43 would take the player to pos44.
   - Moving right from pos44 would take the stone to pos45.
   - Action: `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos44 pos45 dirright`

2. After this action, the player is at pos44 and the stone is at pos45.
   ```
   . . . . .
   . . . . .
   . . . . .
   . . . P S
   . . . . G
   ```

3. Now, to push the stone down to pos55, the player needs to be above the stone.
   - The player is at pos44, which is to the left of pos45.
   - The player needs to get to pos35 (the position above pos45).
   - Let's plan a path for the player to reach pos35:
     - Move left: `move player1 pos44 pos43 dirleft`
     - Move up: `move player1 pos43 pos33 dirup`
     - Move right: `move player1 pos33 pos34 dirright`
     - Move right again: `move player1 pos34 pos35 dirright`

4. Now the player is at pos35 and the stone is at pos45.
   ```
   . . . . .
   . . . . .
   . . . . P
   . . . . S
   . . . . G
   ```

5. Push the stone down:
   - The player is at pos35, which is above pos45.
   - Moving down from pos35 would take the player to pos45.
   - Moving down from pos45 would take the stone to pos55.
   - Action: `pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos35 pos45 pos55 dirdown`

6. After this action, the player is at pos45 and the stone is at pos55 (the goal).
   ```
   . . . . .
   . . . . .
   . . . . .
   . . . . P
   . . . . S
   ```

This seems like a valid plan. Let me double-check:

1. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos44 pos45 dirright`
   - player1 is at pos43 ✓
   - stone1 is at pos44 ✓
   - pos45 is clear ✓
   - pos43 is to the left of pos44, so moving right from pos43 gets to pos44 ✓
   - pos44 is to the left of pos45, so moving right from pos44 gets to pos45 ✓
   - pos45 is not a goal location ✓
   Result: player1 is at pos44, stone1 is at pos45, pos43 is clear

2. `move player1 pos44 pos43 dirleft`
   - player1 is at pos44 ✓
   - pos43 is clear ✓
   - Moving left from pos44 gets to pos43 ✓
   Result: player1 is at pos43, pos44 is clear

3. `move player1 pos43 pos33 dirup`
   - player1 is at pos43 ✓
   - pos33 is clear ✓
   - Moving up from pos43 gets to pos33 ✓
   Result: player1 is at pos33, pos43 is clear

4. `move player1 pos33 pos34 dirright`
   - player1 is at pos33 ✓
   - pos34 is clear ✓
   - Moving right from pos33 gets to pos34 ✓
   Result: player1 is at pos34, pos33 is clear

5. `move player1 pos34 pos35 dirright`
   - player1 is at pos34 ✓
   - pos35 is clear ✓
   - Moving right from pos34 gets to pos35 ✓
   Result: player1 is at pos35, pos34 is clear

6. `pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos35 pos45 pos55 dirdown`
   - player1 is at pos35 ✓
   - stone1 is at pos45 ✓
   - pos55 is clear ✓
   - pos35 is above pos45, so moving down from pos35 gets to pos45 ✓
   - pos45 is above pos55, so moving down from pos45 gets to pos55 ✓
   - pos55 is a goal location ✓
   Result: player1 is at pos45, stone1 is at pos55, pos35 is clear, stone1 is at a goal

This plan seems to work. Let me double-check the preconditions of the actions.

Let's compare the actions I proposed to the problem description:

`pushtonongoal p s l_p l_from l_to d`: You may only perform this action if:
(i) agent p is at location l_p - agent player1 is at pos43.
(ii) stone s is at location l_from - stone1 is at pos44.
(iii) location l_to is clear - pos45 is clear.
(iv) you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d - from pos43 to pos44 following dirright.
(v) you can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d - from pos44 to pos45 following dirright.
(vi) location l_to is not a goal location - pos45 is not a goal.

Cool, the first action looks valid!

`move p l_from l_to d`: You may only perform this action if:
(i) agent p is at location l_from - player1 is at pos44.
(ii) location l_to is clear - pos43 is clear.
(iii) you can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d - from pos44 to pos43 following dirleft.

The move actions all fit the requirements of the problem too.

`pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d`: You may only perform this action if:
(i) agent p is at location l_p - player1 is at pos35.
(ii) stone s is at location l_from - stone1 is at pos45.
(iii) location l_to is clear - pos55 is clear.
(iv) you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d - from pos35 to pos45 following dirdown.
(v) you can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d - from pos45 to pos55 following dirdown.
(vi) location l_to is a goal location - pos55 is a goal.

This checks out, so my plan is valid.

So here is a valid, and I believe optimal, plan to get the stone to the goal location:

```
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos44 pos45 dirright
move player1 pos44 pos43 dirleft
move player1 pos43 pos33 dirup
move player1 pos33 pos34 dirright
move player1 pos34 pos35 dirright
pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos35 pos45 pos55 dirdown
```

Let's make sure I have the precise action names and arguments:

1. "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos44 pos45 dirright"
2. "move player1 pos44 pos43 dirleft"
3. "move player1 pos43 pos33 dirup"
4. "move player1 pos33 pos34 dirright"
5. "move player1 pos34 pos35 dirright"
6. "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos35 pos45 pos55 dirdown"

While I'm pretty confident in this plan, let me just check if there's a shorter path. I think the constraints and initial setup don't offer many alternatives. I need to get the player to a position where it can push the stone to the goal. I've done it in 6 moves, which seems minimal given the constraints. So, I think this is an optimal plan.

```
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos44 pos45 dirright
move player1 pos44 pos43 dirleft
move player1 pos43 pos33 dirup
move player1 pos33 pos34 dirright
move player1 pos34 pos35 dirright
pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos35 pos45 pos55 dirdown
```
