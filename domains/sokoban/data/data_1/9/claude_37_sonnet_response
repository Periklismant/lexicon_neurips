Alright, so we have a Sokoban-like puzzle where our task is to move a stone to a goal position. Let's break down the problem:

1. We have a 5x5 grid (positions pos11 through pos55, where pos11 is the top-left and pos55 is the bottom-right).
2. We have a player (player1) initially at position pos43.
3. We have a stone (stone1) initially at position pos44.
4. The goal position is pos55.

We also have two constraints to satisfy:
1. At some point, pos34 should not be clear (meaning the player or the stone should be there).
2. If pos34 is not clear at some point, then there must be an earlier state where pos33 is not clear.

Our actions are move, pushtogoal, and pushtonongoal.

Let's think about how to solve this:
1. We need to move the stone from pos44 to pos55, which is the goal.
2. To satisfy the constraints, at some point, we need to have either the player or the stone at pos34, and before that, either the player or the stone should be at pos33.

I'll try to figure out a plan that accomplishes this.

First, let's understand the current state:
- player1 is at pos43
- stone1 is at pos44
- pos55 is the goal location

I need to push the stone from pos44 to pos55.

To push the stone, I need to be on the opposite side of the stone compared to the direction I want to push. So, if I want to push the stone down, I need to be above it. If I want to push it right, I need to be to its left, and so on.

From pos44, I can push the stone to pos45 (down) or pos54 (right).
From pos45, I can push the stone to pos55 (right), which is our goal.
From pos54, I can push the stone to pos55 (down), which is our goal.

So, I have two possible paths to the goal:
1. pos44 -> pos45 -> pos55
2. pos44 -> pos54 -> pos55

Let's check if either of these paths allows us to satisfy the constraints. We need to have either the player or the stone at pos34 and, before that, at pos33.

Looking at the grid:
- pos33 is to the left and up of pos44 (our initial stone position).
- pos34 is to the left of pos44.

Hmm, there seems like a direct path. I could move the stone to pos34 first, then to pos33, and then navigate to the goal. But this might not be the most efficient.

Let me try to sketch a plan:

1. Player is at pos43 and the stone is at pos44.
2. Player moves to pos34 (left of stone), which means pos34 is not clear (satisfying one constraint).
3. Before this, player needs to be at pos33 (left and up of stone), which means pos33 is not clear (satisfying the second constraint).

So, a potential plan is:
1. Move player from pos43 to pos33.
2. Move player from pos33 to pos34.
3. Player pushes stone from pos44 to pos45.
4. Player pushes stone from pos45 to pos55.

Let me check if this plan is feasible and satisfies the constraints.

Starting state:
- player1 is at pos43
- stone1 is at pos44

Step 1: Move player from pos43 to pos33.
This is a valid move since pos33 is clear.
After this, player1 is at pos33 and stone1 is at pos44.
At this point, pos33 is not clear, satisfying the second constraint.

Step 2: Move player from pos33 to pos34.
This is a valid move since pos34 is clear.
After this, player1 is at pos34 and stone1 is at pos44.
At this point, pos34 is not clear, satisfying the first constraint.

Step 3: Player pushes stone from pos44 to pos45.
To do this, player needs to be at pos43 (left of stone), but the player is at pos34. So, we need a step to move player to pos43.

Modified plan:
1. Move player from pos43 to pos33.
2. Move player from pos33 to pos34.
3. Move player from pos34 to pos43.
4. Player pushes stone from pos44 to pos45.
5. Player pushes stone from pos45 to pos55.

Let's check this:

Starting state:
- player1 is at pos43
- stone1 is at pos44

Step 1: Move player from pos43 to pos33 (following directionleft)
After this, player1 is at pos33 and stone1 is at pos44.
At this point, pos33 is not clear, satisfying the second constraint.

Step 2: Move player from pos33 to pos34 (following directiondown)
After this, player1 is at pos34 and stone1 is at pos44.
At this point, pos34 is not clear, satisfying the first constraint.

Step 3: Move player from pos34 to pos43 (following directionright)
After this, player1 is at pos43 and stone1 is at pos44.

Step 4: Player pushes stone from pos44 to pos45 (following directiondown).
To do this, player needs to be at pos43 (up of stone), which we are.
After this, player1 is at pos44 and stone1 is at pos45.

Step 5: Player pushes stone from pos45 to pos55 (following directionright).
To do this, player needs to be at pos35 (left of stone), but the player is at pos44. So, we need a step to move player to pos35.

Modified plan:
1. Move player from pos43 to pos33 (following dirleft)
2. Move player from pos33 to pos34 (following dirdown)
3. Move player from pos34 to pos43 (following dirright)
4. Player pushes stone from pos44 to pos45 (following dirdown)
5. Move player from pos44 to pos35 (following dirleft && dirup)
6. Player pushes stone from pos45 to pos55 (following dirright)

Let's check this:

Starting state:
- player1 is at pos43
- stone1 is at pos44

Step 1: Move player from pos43 to pos33 (following dirleft)
After this, player1 is at pos33 and stone1 is at pos44.
At this point, pos33 is not clear, satisfying the second constraint.

Step 2: Move player from pos33 to pos34 (following dirdown)
After this, player1 is at pos34 and stone1 is at pos44.
At this point, pos34 is not clear, satisfying the first constraint.

Step 3: Move player from pos34 to pos43 (following dirright)
After this, player1 is at pos43 and stone1 is at pos44.

Step 4: Player pushes stone from pos44 to pos45 (following dirdown)
To do this, player needs to be in the right position. The player is at pos43 and the stone is at pos44.  To push the stone to pos45, the player needs to be at pos43 (north of the stone), and the stone needs to be pushed south. Since player is already at pos43, we can go ahead with the push.

Hmm, there seems to be an inconsistency in our puzzle representation. The original state says that "Location pos43 is clear" and "Location pos44 is clear", but we also have "player1 is at location pos43" and "stone1 is at location pos44". These are contradictory statements. If player1 is at pos43, then pos43 is not clear. Similarly, if stone1 is at pos44, then pos44 is not clear.

Given the context, I'm assuming that the intended state is:
- player1 is at pos43
- stone1 is at pos44
- pos43 and pos44 are not clear (because they have the player and stone respectively)
- All other locations are clear

Let's proceed with this interpretation:

Starting state:
- player1 is at pos43
- stone1 is at pos44

Step 1: Move player from pos43 to pos33 (following dirleft)
After this, player1 is at pos33 and stone1 is at pos44.
At this point, pos33 is not clear, satisfying the second constraint.

Step 2: Move player from pos33 to pos34 (following dirdown)
After this, player1 is at pos34 and stone1 is at pos44.
At this point, pos34 is not clear, satisfying the first constraint.

Step 3: Move player from pos34 to pos43 (following dirright)
After this, player1 is at pos43 and stone1 is at pos44.

Step 4: Player pushes stone from pos44 to pos45 (following dirdown)
To do this, I need to use the "pushtonongoal" action because pos45 is not a goal location:
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos44 pos45 dirdown
After this, player1 is at pos44 and stone1 is at pos45.

Step 5: The player needs to move to a position from where they can push the stone to pos55. Since the goal is to push the stone from pos45 to pos55, and moving to the right means the player should be to the left of the stone, the player should be at pos35.
Move player from pos44 to pos34 (following dirleft)
After this, player1 is at pos34 and stone1 is at pos45.

Step 6: Move player from pos34 to pos35 (following dirdown)
After this, player1 is at pos35 and stone1 is at pos45.

Step 7: Player pushes stone from pos45 to pos55 (following dirright)
To do this, I need to use the "pushtogoal" action because pos55 is a goal location:
pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos35 pos45 pos55 dirright
After this, player1 is at pos45 and stone1 is at pos55.

Now, stone1 is at a goal location, satisfying our main goal. We've also satisfied the constraints: at one point, pos34 was not clear (Step 2 and Step 5), and before that, pos33 was not clear (Step 1).

Let me flesh out the actual actions using the format given:

1. move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft
2. move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown
3. move player1 pos34 pos43 dirright
4. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos44 pos45 dirdown
5. move player1 pos44 pos34 dirleft
6. move player1 pos34 pos35 dirdown
7. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos35 pos45 pos55 dirright

Wait, let me carefully check that my operations are valid.

"move p l_from l_to d": You may only perform this action if (i) agent p is at location l_from, (ii) location l_to is clear, and (iii) you can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d.

"pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": You may only perform this action if (i) agent p is at location l_p, (ii) stone s is at location l_from, (iii) location l_to is clear, (iv) you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d, (v) you can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d, and (vi) location l_to is a goal location.

"pushtonongoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": You may only perform this action if (i) agent p is at location l_p, (ii) stone s is at location l_from, (iii) location l_to is clear, (iv) you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d, (v) you can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d, and (vi) location l_to is not a goal location.

hmm, let's first check the directions we have in the problem.

"you may move from location pos43 to location pos33 following direction dirleft"

So dirleft moves us to the west.

"you may move from location pos33 to location pos34 following direction dirdown"

So dirdown moves us to the south.

"you may move from location pos34 to location pos43 following direction dirright"

So dirright moves us to the east.

"you may move from location pos43 to location pos42 following direction dirup"

so dirup moves us to the north.

So, our directions are:
- dirleft: west
- dirright: east
- dirup: north
- dirdown: south

Wait, that doesn't make sense for a typical Cartesian grid. Let me clarify the grid based on the adjacency relationships in our problem description.

"you may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright"
"you may move from location pos11 to location pos12 following direction dirdown"

This suggests that the first digit of the coordinate is increasing as we move right, and the second digit is increasing as we move down.

Further, checking:
"you may move from location pos23 to location pos33 following direction dirright"

So it seems the grid is:
pos11 pos21 pos31 pos41 pos51
pos12 pos22 pos32 pos42 pos52
pos13 pos23 pos33 pos43 pos53
pos14 pos24 pos34 pos44 pos54
pos15 pos25 pos35 pos45 pos55

Ok, so if agent is at pos43 and stone is at pos44, the agent is to the left of the stone, not above. Let me double-check this by checking the allowed direction:

"you may move from location pos43 to location pos44 following direction dirdown"

Indeed. So, let me revise the plan.

Starting state:
- player1 is at pos43 (to the left of the stone)
- stone1 is at pos44 (to the right of the player)
- Goal is to move stone1 to pos55 (bottom-right corner)

To get the constraints satisfied, we need to ensure pos34 is not clear at some point, and before that, pos33 is not clear.

Since our player is initially at pos43 (3rd row, 3rd column), the stone is at pos44 (3rd row, 4th column), and the goal is at pos55 (5th row, 5th column), we need to push the stone down and to the right.

So let me think about the plan:

1. The player is initially at pos43 (3rd row, 3rd column), and the stone is at pos44 (3rd row, 4th column).
2. To push the stone to the right, the player needs to be to the left of the stone, which they already are.
3. We can push the stone to pos54 (4th row, 4th column).
4. To push the stone down from pos54 to pos55, the player needs to be above the stone at pos44.
5. But then, the stone would no longer be at pos54, so the player needs to go around.

Let's see.

Starting state:
- player1 is at pos43
- stone1 is at pos44

Step 1: Player pushes stone to the right.
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos44 pos54 dirdown
After this, player1 is at pos44 and stone1 is at pos54.

Step 2: Player needs to move to pos53 to push the stone to the goal.
Move player1 from pos44 to pos43 (following dirup)
Move player1 from pos43 to pos53 (following dirright)
After this, player1 is at pos53 and stone1 is at pos54.

Step 3: Player pushes stone to the goal.
pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos53 pos54 pos55 dirdown
After this, player1 is at pos54 and stone1 is at pos55.

This plan works, but it doesn't satisfy the constraints. We haven't had either the player or the stone at pos34 (2nd row, 4th column), and we also haven't had them at pos33 (2nd row, 3rd column).

Let's adjust our strategy to ensure these two positions are not clear at some point.

Starting state:
- player1 is at pos43
- stone1 is at pos44

Step 1: Move player to pos33 (2nd row, 3rd column), making it not clear.
move player1 pos43 pos33 dirup
After this, player1 is at pos33 and stone1 is at pos44.
At this point, pos33 is not clear.

Step 2: Move player to pos34 (2nd row, 4th column), making it not clear.
move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown
After this, player1 is at pos34 and stone1 is at pos44.
At this point, pos34 is not clear.

Step 3: Move player back to pos43 to push the stone.
move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup
move player1 pos33 pos43 dirdown
After this, player1 is at pos43 and stone1 is at pos44.

Step 4: Player pushes stone to the right.
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos44 pos54 dirdown
After this, player1 is at pos44 and stone1 is at pos54.

Step 5: Player moves to get to pos53 to push the stone to the goal.
move player1 pos44 pos43 dirup
move player1 pos43 pos53 dirright
After this, player1 is at pos53 and stone1 is at pos54.

Step 6: Player pushes stone to the goal.
pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos53 pos54 pos55 dirdown
After this, player1 is at pos54 and stone1 is at pos55.

This plan should work and satisfy the constraints. Let me check this.

Wait, I think I'm misunderstanding the grid. Let me again review the directional operations:

"you may move from location pos43 to location pos33 following direction dirleft"
"you may move from location pos43 to location pos44 following direction dirdown"
"you may move from location pos43 to location pos53 following direction dirright"
"you may move from location pos43 to location pos42 following direction dirup"

So:
- dirleft decreases the first coordinate.
- dirdown increases the second coordinate.
- dirright increases the first coordinate.
- dirup decreases the second coordinate.

So, the grid is:
pos11 pos21 pos31 pos41 pos51
pos12 pos22 pos32 pos42 pos52
pos13 pos23 pos33 pos43 pos53
pos14 pos24 pos34 pos44 pos54
pos15 pos25 pos35 pos45 pos55

Alright, I think this is a standard grid. The first index represents the column (increases from left to right), and the second index represents the row (increases from top to bottom).

So our starting state is:
- player1 is at pos43 (which is at the 4th column, 3rd row)
- stone1 is at pos44 (which is at the 4th column, 4th row, so directly below the player)
- Goal is at pos55 (which is at the 5th column, 5th row)

Now, let's replan:

Starting state:
- player1 is at pos43 (4th column, 3rd row)
- stone1 is at pos44 (4th column, 4th row)

Step 1: We need to satisfy the constraint that pos34 is not clear at some point. To get to pos34, we'll move the player there.
move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft
move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown
After this, player1 is at pos34 and stone1 is at pos44.
At this point, pos34 is not clear, satisfying the first constraint.

But wait, our constraint is: "If expression 'Location pos34 is not clear' holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: 'Location pos33 is not clear'". This means that the player (or stone) should be at pos33 before they are at pos34.

So let's adjust:

Step 1: Move player to pos33, making it not clear.
move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft
After this, player1 is at pos33 and stone1 is at pos44.
At this point, pos33 is not clear, setting up for the second constraint.

Step 2: Move player to pos34, making it not clear.
move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown
After this, player1 is at pos34 and stone1 is at pos44.
At this point, pos34 is not clear, and because pos33 was not clear in an earlier state, we've satisfied both constraints.

Step 3: Now, we need to get to a position where we can push the stone to the goal. From pos44, we could either push the stone to the right (pos54) and then down (pos55), or directly down (pos45) and then to the right (pos55).

Let's try the first approach:

Step 3a: Move player from pos34 to a position where they can push the stone to the right.
move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup
move player1 pos33 pos43 dirright
After this, player1 is at pos43 and stone1 is at pos44.

Step 3b: Player pushes stone to the right.
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos44 pos54 dirdown
After this, player1 is at pos44 and stone1 is at pos54.

Wait, this doesn't work. We can't push the stone from pos44 to pos54 because they're not adjacent. By "dirdown", the stone would be pushed to pos45.

Actually, I think my understanding of the grid has been incorrect all along. In this domain, "dirdown" means to move the agent or push the stone to the location with a higher second index. Similarly, "dirright" means to move to the location with a higher first index, and so on.

So, if we're at pos44 and move "dirdown", we'd go to pos45. If we move "dirright", we'd go to pos54.

With this understanding:
- pos43 (player's starting position) is at the 4th row, 3rd column
- pos44 (stone's starting position) is at the 4th row, 4th column
- pos55 (goal position) is at the 5th row, 5th column

Hmm, this doesn't quite seem right either. Let me look at the allowed movements again:

"you may move from location pos43 to location pos33 following direction dirleft"
This suggests pos33 is to the left of pos43.

"you may move from location pos43 to location pos44 following direction dirdown"
This suggests pos44 is below pos43.

"you may move from location pos43 to location pos53 following direction dirright"
This suggests pos53 is to the right of pos43.

"you may move from location pos43 to location pos42 following direction dirup"
This suggests pos42 is above pos43.

So pos43 is somewhere in the middle, and it looks like the first index (row) increases as we move right, and the second index (column) increases as we move down.

This would make the grid:
pos11 pos21 pos31 pos41 pos51
pos12 pos22 pos32 pos42 pos52
pos13 pos23 pos33 pos43 pos53
pos14 pos24 pos34 pos44 pos54
pos15 pos25 pos35 pos45 pos55

Let's confirm with another entry:
"you may move from location pos33 to location pos23 following direction dirleft"
This would mean pos23 is to the left of pos33.
"you may move from location pos33 to location pos34 following direction dirdown"
This means pos34 is below pos33.

With this understanding:
- pos43 (player's starting position) is at the 4th row, 3rd column
- pos44 (stone's starting position) is at the 4th row, 4th column
- pos55 (goal position) is at the 5th row, 5th column


Now, let's re-create the plan:

Starting state:
- player1 is at pos43 (4th row, 3rd column)
- stone1 is at pos44 (4th row, 4th column, to the right of the player)

Step 1: Move player to pos33, making it not clear.
move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft
After this, player1 is at pos33 and stone1 is at pos44.
At this point, pos33 is not clear, setting up for the constraint.

Step 2: Move player to pos34, making it not clear.
move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown
After this, player1 is at pos34 and stone1 is at pos44.
At this point, pos34 is not clear, and because pos33 was not clear in an earlier state, we've satisfied the constraint.

Step 3: Move player to push the stone to the goal.
move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright
After this, player1 is at pos44 and stone1 is... wait, we have a conflict. If player is at pos44, where is the stone?

Step 3: Move player to a position to push the stone.
Given the positions:
- player1 is at pos34
- stone1 is at pos44
We need to move to a position to push the stone. Since we want to push it towards pos55 (bottom-right), we could either push it down first and then right, or right first and then down.

Option 1: Push it down first, then right.
To push it down, we need to be above it. 
We're at pos34, we need to move to pos43 (to the right and up).
move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright
Hmm, this will cause a conflict with the stone.

Option 2: Push it right first, then down.
To push it right, we need to be to its left.
We're at pos34, we need to move to pos43 (to the right and up).
move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup
move player1 pos33 pos43 dirright
After these moves, player1 is at pos43 and stone1 is at pos44.
Now push the stone right:
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos44 pos54 dirright
After this, player1 is at pos44 and stone1 is at pos54.
Now, to push the stone down from pos54 to pos55, player1 needs to be above the stone. So move the player to pos53:
move player1 pos44 pos43 dirleft
move player1 pos43 pos53 dirright
After these moves, player1 is at pos53 and stone1 is at pos54.
Finally, push the stone down to the goal:
pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos53 pos54 pos55 dirdown
After this, player1 is at pos54 and stone1 is at pos55, which is the goal.

Let's check this plan again to ensure it's correct and satisfies the constraints:

Starting state:
- player1 is at pos43 (4th row, 3rd column)
- stone1 is at pos44 (4th row, 4th column, to the right of the player)

1. move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft
   Now player1 is at pos33 and stone1 is at pos44.
   pos33 is not clear, setting up for the constraint.

2. move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown
   Now player1 is at pos34 and stone1 is at pos44.
   pos34 is not clear, and because pos33 was not clear in an earlier state, we've satisfied the constraint.

3. move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup
   Now player1 is at pos33 and stone1 is at pos44.

4. move player1 pos33 pos43 dirright
   Now player1 is at pos43 and stone1 is at pos44.

5. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos44 pos54 dirright
   Now player1 is at pos44 and stone1 is at pos54.

6. move player1 pos44 pos43 dirleft
   Now player1 is at pos43 and stone1 is at pos54.

7. move player1 pos43 pos53 dirright
   Now player1 is at pos53 and stone1 is at pos54.

8. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos53 pos54 pos55 dirdown
   Now player1 is at pos54 and stone1 is at pos55, which is the goal.

Perfect, this plan works and satisfies all the constraints.

Let's see if we can spot any optimizations. The key constraint is that pos33 must be not clear before pos34 is not clear. Once the stone is at the goal, we're done. We can try to find the shortest path that satisfies these constraints.

Let's check if there's any shorter path from the initial state to the goal:

Starting state:
- player1 is at pos43
- stone1 is at pos44

We have to make pos33 and pos34 not clear in that order. Given the positions, the player can directly push the stone to the right first and then down to reach the goal. But to satisfy the constraints, the player has to move to pos33 and then pos34.

We need to ensure that the player visits pos33 first and then pos34. We can't really make the stone visit these positions, so we're constrained to the path we've already outlined.

So, our plan is:
1. move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft
2. move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown
3. move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup
4. move player1 pos33 pos43 dirright
5. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos44 pos54 dirright
6. move player1 pos44 pos43 dirleft
7. move player1 pos43 pos53 dirright
8. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos53 pos54 pos55 dirdown

Let me check if there are any other shorter paths that still satisfy the constraints.

Actually, we don't have to move the player back to pos33 in step 3. We could directly move the player from pos34 to pos44, which would be a shorter path. But there's a conflict issue: the stone is at pos44. So the player can't move there directly.

We could try:
1. move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft
2. move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown
3. move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft
4. move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup
5. move player1 pos23 pos33 dirright
6. move player1 pos33 pos43 dirright
7. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos44 pos54 dirright
8. move player1 pos44 pos43 dirleft
9. move player1 pos43 pos53 dirright
10. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos53 pos54 pos55 dirdown

No, my previous plan with 8 steps seems shorter.

What about this path?
1. move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft
2. move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown
3. move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft
4. move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright
5. move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright
6. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos54 dirup
   Wait, this doesn't work. The "pushtonongoal" action requires the player to be in a position to push the stone, and the player can't be at pos44 at the same time as the stone.

So, our 8-step plan is likely optimal.

1. move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft
2. move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown
3. move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup
4. move player1 pos33 pos43 dirright
5. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos44 pos54 dirright
6. move player1 pos44 pos43 dirleft
7. move player1 pos43 pos53 dirright
8. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos53 pos54 pos55 dirdown

Let's double-check this plan:

1. "move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft": Player1 is at pos43 (check), pos33 is clear (check), and there's a valid move from pos43 to pos33 following dirleft (check). After this action, player1 is at pos33, pos43 is clear, and pos33 is not clear.

2. "move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown": Player1 is at pos33 (check), pos34 is clear (check), and there's a valid move from pos33 to pos34 following dirdown (check). After this action, player1 is at pos34, pos33 is clear, and pos34 is not clear.

3. "move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup": Player1 is at pos34 (check), pos33 is clear (check), and there's a valid move from pos34 to pos33 following dirup (check). After this action, player1 is at pos33, pos34 is clear, and pos33 is not clear.

4. "move player1 pos33 pos43 dirright": Player1 is at pos33 (check), pos43 is clear (check), and there's a valid move from pos33 to pos43 following dirright (check). After this action, player1 is at pos43, pos33 is clear, and pos43 is not clear.

5. "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos44 pos54 dirright": Player1 is at pos43 (check), stone1 is at pos44 (check), pos54 is clear (check), there's a valid move from pos43 to pos44 following dirright (check), there's a valid move from pos44 to pos54 following dirright (check), and pos54 is not a goal location (check). After this action, player1 is at pos44, stone1 is at pos54, pos43 is clear, and pos44 is not clear.

6. "move player1 pos44 pos43 dirleft": Player1 is at pos44 (check), pos43 is clear (check), and there's a valid move from pos44 to pos43 following dirleft (check). After this action, player1 is at pos43, pos44 is clear, and pos43 is not clear.

7. "move player1 pos43 pos53 dirright": Player1 is at pos43 (check), pos53 is clear (check), and there's a valid move from pos43 to pos53 following dirright (check). After this action, player1 is at pos53, pos43 is clear, and pos53 is not clear.

8. "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos53 pos54 pos55 dirdown": Player1 is at pos53 (check), stone1 is at pos54 (check), pos55 is clear (check), there's a valid move from pos53 to pos54 following dirdown (check), there's a valid move from pos54 to pos55 following dirdown (check), and pos55 is a goal location (check). After this action, player1 is at pos54, stone1 is at pos55, pos53 is clear, pos54 is not clear, and stone1 is at a goal location.

The plan is valid, and stone1 is now at a goal location (pos55). Constraints are satisfied: pos33 was not clear (steps 1 and 3) before pos34 was not clear (step 2). The overall goal, having the stone at a goal location, is achieved in step 8.

Let me check if our plan is optimal. The minimum number of stone pushes needed is 2 (from pos44 to pos54, and then from pos54 to pos55). Additionally, the player needs to move from its initial position (pos43) to a position to push the stone in each of these two steps (pos43 for the first push, and pos53 for the second push). Plus, we need to satisfy the constraint that pos33 is not clear before pos34 is not clear.

So, a minimal optimal plan would move the player to pos33, then to pos34, and then position the player to push the stone to the goal in the two steps mentioned. This is exactly what our 8-step plan does, so it's indeed optimal.

Let's finalize our plan:

1. move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft
2. move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown
3. move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup
4. move player1 pos33 pos43 dirright
5. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos44 pos54 dirright
6. move player1 pos44 pos43 dirleft
7. move player1 pos43 pos53 dirright
8. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos53 pos54 pos55 dirdown
