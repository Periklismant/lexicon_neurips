Let's break down this problem:

1. We have a 2D square grid where each position may be empty, or contain the agent or a stone.
2. Some positions are goal positions.
3. The agent's task is to move all stones to goal positions.

Let me visualize the grid based on the information:

```
    1   2   3   4   5
  +---+---+---+---+---+
1 |   |   |   |   |   |
  +---+---+---+---+---+
2 |   |   |   |   |   |
  +---+---+---+---+---+
3 |   |   |   |   |   |
  +---+---+---+---+---+
4 | P |   |   | S |   |
  +---+---+---+---+---+
5 |   |   |   |   |   |
  +---+---+---+---+---+
```

Where:
- P: player (agent)
- S: stone
- Goal positions are not marked, but the information says that pos45 is a goal location.

Now, I need to:
1. Move the player next to the stone.
2. Push the stone to the goal position.

The goal is pos45, which is to the lower right of the stone's position (pos44). So I need to push the stone down.

To push the stone down, the player needs to be above the stone. So the player needs to be at pos34.

Here's a plan:
1. Move the player from pos41 to pos42 (right).
2. Move the player from pos42 to pos43 (right).
3. Move the player from pos43 to pos44 (right).
4. Move the player from pos44 to pos34 (up).
5. Push the stone from pos44 to pos45 (down).

Wait, I made a mistake. Let's clarify the positions.

Given the information:
- "player1 is at location pos41"
- "stone1 is at location pos44"
- "pos45 is a goal location"

If I look at the moves:
- "You may move from location pos41 to location pos31 following direction dirleft"
- "You may move from location pos41 to location pos51 following direction dirright"
- "You may move from location pos41 to location pos42 following direction dirdown"

It seems like the grid is laid out a bit differently. Let me revise:

```
    1   2   3   4   5
  +---+---+---+---+---+
1 |   |   |   |   |   |
  +---+---+---+---+---+
2 |   |   |   |   |   |
  +---+---+---+---+---+
3 |   |   |   |   |   |
  +---+---+---+---+---+
4 | P |   |   | S |   |
  +---+---+---+---+---+
5 |   |   |   |   |   |
  +---+---+---+---+---+
```

Where:
- The first digit in "posXY" represents the row (height).
- The second digit in "posXY" represents the column (width).
- "dirdown" means moving to the next row (e.g., from pos41 to pos42).
- "dirright" means moving to the right column (e.g., from pos41 to pos51).

Based on this, pos45 (goal) is the bottom right corner of the grid.

Actually, I'm not sure about the axis yet. Let me carefully go through the movement directions:

From "You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright", it seems like the first digit increases when moving to the right, so I'm thinking the first digit represents the column.

From "You may move from location pos11 to location pos12 following direction dirdown", it seems like the second digit increases when moving down, so I'm thinking the second digit represents the row.

Let's try a different visualization:

```
    1   2   3   4   5
  +---+---+---+---+---+
1 |   |   |   |   |   |
  +---+---+---+---+---+
2 |   |   |   |   |   |
  +---+---+---+---+---+
3 |   |   |   |   |   |
  +---+---+---+---+---+
4 | P |   |   | S |   |
  +---+---+---+---+---+
5 |   |   |   |   |   |
  +---+---+---+---+---+
```

Where:
- The first digit in "posXY" represents the column.
- The second digit in "posXY" represents the row.
- "dirdown" means moving to the next row (e.g., from pos11 to pos12).
- "dirright" means moving to the right column (e.g., from pos11 to pos21).

No, this still doesn't quite match all the movement rules.

On third thought, I think I initially had it right, but I misunderstood the directions. Let's try:

```
    1   2   3   4   5
  +---+---+---+---+---+
1 |   |   |   |   |   |
  +---+---+---+---+---+
2 |   |   |   |   |   |
  +---+---+---+---+---+
3 |   |   |   |   |   |
  +---+---+---+---+---+
4 | P |   |   | S |   |
  +---+---+---+---+---+
5 |   |   |   |   |   |
  +---+---+---+---+---+
```

Where:
- The first digit in "posXY" represents the row.
- The second digit in "posXY" represents the column.
- "dirdown" means moving down (increasing the first digit).
- "dirright" means moving to the right (increasing the second digit).

This matches the following move:
- "You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright" (Move right: increase first digit)
- "You may move from location pos11 to location pos12 following direction dirdown" (Move down: increase second digit)

No, that doesn't work either.

I need to be more careful. Let's examine a specific movement:

"You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright"

If dirright means moving right, then pos21 should be to the right of pos11. So, the first digit of posXY would represent the column.

"You may move from location pos11 to location pos12 following direction dirdown"

If dirdown means moving down, then pos12 should be below pos11. So, the second digit of posXY would represent the row.

Let's try this layout:

```
    1   2   3   4   5
  +---+---+---+---+---+
1 |11 |21 |31 |41 |51 |
  +---+---+---+---+---+
2 |12 |22 |32 |42 |52 |
  +---+---+---+---+---+
3 |13 |23 |33 |43 |53 |
  +---+---+---+---+---+
4 |14 |24 |34 |44 |54 |
  +---+---+---+---+---+
5 |15 |25 |35 |45 |55 |
  +---+---+---+---+---+
```

Let's check another movement:
"You may move from location pos12 to location pos22 following direction dirright"

In the layout I drew, pos22 is to the right of pos12, so that's consistent with dirright.

"You may move from location pos12 to location pos11 following direction dirup"

In the layout, pos11 is above pos12, so that's consistent with dirup.

Yeah, this layout seems to be correct. So, in our Sokoban-like puzzle:
- Player1 is at location pos41 (4th column, 1st row).
- Stone1 is at location pos44 (4th column, 4th row).
- The goal is at pos45 (4th column, 5th row).

So:

```
    1   2   3   4   5
  +---+---+---+---+---+
1 |   |   |   | P |   |
  +---+---+---+---+---+
2 |   |   |   |   |   |
  +---+---+---+---+---+
3 |   |   |   |   |   |
  +---+---+---+---+---+
4 |   |   |   | S |   |
  +---+---+---+---+---+
5 |   |   |   | G |   |
  +---+---+---+---+---+
```

Where:
- P: player (agent)
- S: stone
- G: goal position

Now, to push the stone to the goal, the player needs to be above the stone, so the player needs to be at pos43 (not pos34 as I initially thought).

Here's the plan:
1. Move the player from pos41 to pos42 (dirdown).
2. Move the player from pos42 to pos43 (dirdown).
3. Push the stone from pos44 to pos45 (dirdown).

Let's convert this to the required action format:

1. move player1 pos41 pos42 dirdown
2. move player1 pos42 pos43 dirdown
3. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos44 pos45 dirdown

Hmm, but I see a potential issue:

Looking at the preconditions for "pushtogoal":
- agent p is at location l_p
- stone s is at location l_from
- location l_to is clear
- you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d
- you can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d
- location l_to is a goal location

So, when the player is at pos43 and wants to push the stone at pos44 to pos45, the direction should be dirdown. But I need to make sure that you can get from pos43 to pos44 following direction dirdown, and you can get from pos44 to pos45 following direction dirdown.

From the information:
"You may move from location pos43 to location pos44 following direction dirdown"
"You may move from location pos44 to location pos45 following direction dirdown"

This confirms that the player can move from pos43 to pos44 following dirdown, and from pos44 to pos45 following dirdown. So, my plan is correct.

My plan is:
1. move player1 pos41 pos42 dirdown
2. move player1 pos42 pos43 dirdown
3. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos44 pos45 dirdown

Let's recheck to confirm that all preconditions are satisfied for each action:

For Move 1 (move player1 pos41 pos42 dirdown):
- player1 is at pos41 (initial state)
- pos42 is clear (initial state)
- you can move from pos41 to pos42 following dirdown (rule)

For Move 2 (move player1 pos42 pos43 dirdown):
- player1 is at pos42 (after Move 1)
- pos43 is clear (initial state)
- you can move from pos42 to pos43 following dirdown (rule)

For Move 3 (pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos44 pos45 dirdown):
- player1 is at pos43 (after Move 2)
- stone1 is at pos44 (initial state)
- pos45 is clear (initial state)
- you can move from pos43 to pos44 following dirdown (rule)
- you can move from pos44 to pos45 following dirdown (rule)
- pos45 is a goal location (initial state)

All preconditions are satisfied. The plan is correct.

However, I notice an issue. The problem statement says:
"Location pos41 is clear" and "Location pos44 is clear".

This contradicts my earlier understanding where player1 is at pos41 and stone1 is at pos44. Let me revisit the initial state.

The original state includes:
"player1 is at location pos41"
"stone1 is at location pos44"

But it also includes:
"Location pos41 is clear"
"Location pos44 is clear"

This seems contradictory. If player1 is at pos41, that position shouldn't be clear. Same for the stone.

Hmm, I think it's probably just redundant information or a mistake in the problem statement.

Let's assume the information that the player and stone are at their respective positions is correct. If a position is occupied, it isn't clear, and vice versa.

With that in mind, I'll go ahead with the original plan:

1. move player1 pos41 pos42 dirdown
2. move player1 pos42 pos43 dirdown
3. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos44 pos45 dirdown

Ah, I think the contradiction is due to a mistake in the problem encoding. Let's assume that the agent's position and the stone's position are not clear in the initial state of the problem.

Let's proceed with the plan I've outlined.

I only need to ensure that there are no other constraints or considerations I've missed.

I also noticed a potential issue in the way I initially understood the problem. I've been interpreting positions on the grid based on a coordinate (X,Y) system, where X is the column and Y is the row. 

But on re-examining, it seems like "posXY" is where X is the row (from top to bottom) and Y is the column (from left to right). Actually, from all the move rules, it looks like I've been interpreting correctly.

Let me double check:

"You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright" -> Moving right, you increase the first digit (column).
"You may move from location pos11 to location pos12 following direction dirdown" -> Moving down, you increase the second digit (row).

This is consistent with the way I've been interpreting.

Alright, so my plan is still:

1. Move the player from pos41 to pos42 (dirdown).
2. Move the player from pos42 to pos43 (dirdown).
3. Push the stone from pos44 to pos45 (dirdown).

In the required action format:

1. move player1 pos41 pos42 dirdown
2. move player1 pos42 pos43 dirdown
3. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos44 pos45 dirdown
