Let me understand this problem:

1. We have a 2D grid with positions labeled as pos11, pos12, etc. (I assume this means row 1, column 1, row 1, column 2, etc.).
2. We have a player (player1) and a stone (stone1).
3. The goal is to move the stone to a goal location.
4. Actions include moving the player and pushing stones (to goal or non-goal locations).
5. There are additional constraints:
   - We must have a state where pos45 is not clear at some point in the plan.
   - Before that state, we must have a state where the player is at pos13.

The initial state is:
- player1 is at pos41 (row 4, column 1)
- stone1 is at pos44 (row 4, column 4)
- pos45 is a goal location (row 4, column 5)
- All other positions are clear.

The goal is to move stone1 to a goal location, which in this case is pos45.

Now let's trace through a possible solution:

1. Currently, player1 is at pos41 and stone1 is at pos44.
2. We need to get player1 to a position from where it can push stone1 towards the goal.
3. For stone1 to move to pos45, the player needs to be at pos43 to push it. (Player at pos43, stone at pos44, and pushing it to pos45.)
4. But before all this, we need to satisfy the constraint that player1 must be at pos13 at some point.

Let's plan:

1. First, we need to navigate player1 from pos41 to pos13.
   - Move player1 from pos41 to pos31
   - Move player1 from pos31 to pos21
   - Move player1 from pos21 to pos11
   - Move player1 from pos11 to pos12
   - Move player1 from pos12 to pos13
   
2. Then, we need to navigate player1 to pos43 to push stone1.
   - Move player1 from pos13 to pos23
   - Move player1 from pos23 to pos33
   - Move player1 from pos33 to pos43
   
3. Finally, we push stone1 to the goal location.
   - Push stone1 from pos44 to goal pos45

So a valid plan would be:

```
move player1 pos41 pos31 dirleft
move player1 pos31 pos21 dirleft
move player1 pos21 pos11 dirleft
move player1 pos11 pos12 dirdown
move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown
move player1 pos13 pos23 dirright
move player1 pos23 pos33 dirright
move player1 pos33 pos43 dirright
pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos44 pos45 dirdown
```

Let's double-check this plan against the constraints:

1. Constraint: Location pos45 is not clear in at least one state.
   - After pushing stone1 to pos45, the location is no longer clear. So this constraint is satisfied.

2. Constraint: Before pos45 is not clear, player1 should be at pos13.
   - In our plan, player1 is at pos13 before pos45 becomes not clear. So this constraint is satisfied.

3. Goal: stone1 is at a goal location.
   - After pushing stone1 to pos45, it's at a goal location. So the goal is achieved.

However, I want to make sure I've understood the directions correctly. Let me review the action definitions:

- "move p l_from l_to d": The player moves from l_from to l_to in direction d.
- "pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": The player p at location l_p pushes stone s from l_from to goal location l_to in direction d.
- "pushtonongoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": The player p at location l_p pushes stone s from l_from to non-goal location l_to in direction d.

For the push actions, l_p is the position of the player before the push, l_from is the initial position of the stone, and l_to is the destination of the stone. The direction d should specify how the player approaches the stone and pushes it.

Let's revisit the push action in our plan:
- "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos44 pos45 dirdown"

This action says:
- Player1 is at pos43
- Stone1 is at pos44
- Player1 pushes stone1 from pos44 to pos45
- The direction is dirdown (meaning the player approaches the stone from above and pushes it downward)

But as I re-read, I think I may have misunderstood the direction parameter. Let me revise my understanding:

"move p l_from l_to d": You may only perform this action if (i) agent p is at location l_from, (ii) location l_to is clear, and (iii) **you can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d**."

Clearly, the direction specifies how to get from l_from to l_to. Given the grid layout, I interpreted the directions as:
- dirright: Move from a position with a lower column number to a higher column number (e.g., from pos11 to pos21).
- dirleft: Move from a position with a higher column number to a lower column number (e.g., from pos21 to pos11).
- dirdown: Move from a position with a lower row number to a higher row number (e.g., from pos11 to pos12).
- dirup: Move from a position with a higher row number to a lower row number (e.g., from pos12 to pos11).

But I realize I may have mixed up the rows and columns. Let me look at the directions more carefully based on the provided constraints:

"You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright"

This suggests:
- dirright: Move to the right (i.e., the column increases).
- dirleft: Move to the left (i.e., the column decreases).
- dirdown: Move downward (i.e., the row increases).
- dirup: Move upward (i.e., the row decreases).

So the grid seems to be laid out like:
```
pos11 pos21 pos31 pos41 pos51
pos12 pos22 pos32 pos42 pos52
pos13 pos23 pos33 pos43 pos53
pos14 pos24 pos34 pos44 pos54
pos15 pos25 pos35 pos45 pos55
```

With this understanding, let's revise our plan:

1. First, we need to navigate player1 from pos41 to pos13.
   - Move player1 from pos41 to pos31 dirleft
   - Move player1 from pos31 to pos21 dirleft
   - Move player1 from pos21 to pos11 dirleft
   - Move player1 from pos11 to pos12 dirdown
   - Move player1 from pos12 to pos13 dirdown
   
2. Then, we need to navigate player1 to pos43 to push stone1.
   - Move player1 from pos13 to pos23 dirright
   - Move player1 from pos23 to pos33 dirright
   - Move player1 from pos33 to pos43 dirright
   
3. Finally, we push stone1 to the goal location.
   - Push stone1 from pos44 to goal pos45. For this, the player would push the stone to the right, so the direction would be dirright.

OK, so the revised plan would be:

```
move player1 pos41 pos31 dirleft
move player1 pos31 pos21 dirleft
move player1 pos21 pos11 dirleft
move player1 pos11 pos12 dirdown
move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown
move player1 pos13 pos23 dirright
move player1 pos23 pos33 dirright
move player1 pos33 pos43 dirright
pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos44 pos45 dirright
```

But wait, I think I'm still confused about the "pushtogoal" action.

"pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": You may only perform this action if (i) agent p is at location l_p, (ii) stone s is at location l_from, (iii) location l_to is clear, (iv) **you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d**, (v) **you can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d**, and (vi) location l_to is a goal location.

Going by this precondition, 'dirright' seems to be the direction the player approaches the stone, and also the direction the stone is pushed. It's redundant, but that seems to be the definition.

For our case, in order to push stone1 from pos44 to pos45, player1 needs to be at pos43. The direction from pos43 to pos44 is dirright, and the direction from pos44 to pos45 is also dirright. So, the push action would be:

pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos44 pos45 dirright

Wait, I'm not sure if I'm reading the layout of the positions correctly. Let's double-check:

"You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright"

This suggests pos21 is to the right of pos11.

"You may move from location pos11 to location pos12 following direction dirdown"

This suggests pos12 is below pos11.

So, the grid layout is:
```
pos11 pos21 pos31 pos41 pos51
pos12 pos22 pos32 pos42 pos52
pos13 pos23 pos33 pos43 pos53
pos14 pos24 pos34 pos44 pos54
pos15 pos25 pos35 pos45 pos55
```

This confirms my revised understanding.

Now, let's see if there's a more efficient plan. We're currently going from pos41 to pos13 (a diagonal move) and then back to pos43. Is there a more direct path that still satisfies the constraints?

Actually, if we go from pos41 to pos31 to pos32 to pos33 to pos23 to pos13, and then back to pos23 to pos33 to pos43, it seems both paths have 8 movement actions (before the push).

Let's finalize our plan:

```
move player1 pos41 pos31 dirleft
move player1 pos31 pos21 dirleft
move player1 pos21 pos11 dirleft
move player1 pos11 pos12 dirdown
move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown
move player1 pos13 pos23 dirright
move player1 pos23 pos33 dirright
move player1 pos33 pos43 dirright
pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos44 pos45 dirright
```

This plan satisfies the constraints and achieves the goal. player1 is at pos13 before pos45 is not clear, and stone1 ends up at a goal location.

Let me double-check if there's a shorter path to pos13 from the starting position (pos41):
- From pos41, we go up one row to pos31, then left to pos21, then to pos11, then down to pos12, and finally to pos13. That's 5 moves.

Let's check an alternative:
- From pos41, we go up to pos31, then right to pos32, then pos33, then pos23, then pos13. That's also 5 moves.

So both paths are of the same length. But I also wonder if there are other constraints or issues I'm missing. For example, if I consider the constraint "Before pos45 is not clear, player1 should be at pos13", we don't necessarily have to go to pos13 right at the start; rather, we could go to pos13 at any point before pushing the stone to pos45.

Could we optimize by doing a "pushtonongoal" action at some point? Let's think...

Actually, we could make it shorter by moving player1 directly to pos43, then to pos13, and then back to pos43 to push the stone. Let's see:

1. Move player1 from pos41 to pos31 dirleft
2. Move player1 from pos31 to pos32 dirdown
3. Move player1 from pos32 to pos33 dirdown
4. Move player1 from pos33 to pos43 dirright
5. Move player1 from pos43 to pos33 dirleft
6. Move player1 from pos33 to pos23 dirleft
7. Move player1 from pos23 to pos13 dirleft
8. Move player1 from pos13 to pos23 dirright
9. Move player1 from pos23 to pos33 dirright
10. Move player1 from pos33 to pos43 dirright
11. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos44 pos45 dirright

That's 11 actions.

But the previous plan had only 9 actions:
1. move player1 pos41 pos31 dirleft
2. move player1 pos31 pos21 dirleft
3. move player1 pos21 pos11 dirleft
4. move player1 pos11 pos12 dirdown
5. move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown
6. move player1 pos13 pos23 dirright
7. move player1 pos23 pos33 dirright
8. move player1 pos33 pos43 dirright
9. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos44 pos45 dirright

So the original plan is already optimal.

But wait, I've been assuming player1 must be at pos13 at some point. Let's double-check the constraint:

"If expression 'Location pos45 is not clear' holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: 'player1 is at location pos13'"

This means that if pos45 is occupied at some point (which will happen when we push stone1 there), then player1 must have been at pos13 at an earlier state. So we do indeed need to ensure that player1 is at pos13 at some point before pushing the stone to pos45.

Given this, our original plan with 9 actions seems optimal.

Let's make a slight adjustment to our plan to ensure I'm following the action signatures correctly:

1. move player1 pos41 pos31 dirleft
2. move player1 pos31 pos21 dirleft
3. move player1 pos21 pos11 dirleft
4. move player1 pos11 pos12 dirdown
5. move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown
6. move player1 pos13 pos23 dirright
7. move player1 pos23 pos33 dirright
8. move player1 pos33 pos43 dirright
9. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos44 pos45 dirright

This plan satisfies all the constraints and achieves the goal. The player is at pos13 at some point before pos45 is not clear, and in the end, stone1 is at a goal location.

Actually, I am confused on some of the directions. 

In particular, step 1 should be dirleft, not dirright. When looking at the location mapping abilities:
"You may move from location pos41 to location pos31 following direction dirleft"
This is step 1 in our plan, and it involves moving from pos41 to pos31, which is to the left.

Similarly, step 2 should also be dirleft, not dirright. When looking at the location mapping abilities:
"You may move from location pos31 to location pos21 following direction dirleft"
This is step 2 in our plan, and it involves moving from pos31 to pos21, which is to the left.

And similarly for the other steps. Let me double-check each step with the provided constraints:

"You may move from location pos41 to location pos31 following direction dirleft"
"You may move from location pos31 to location pos21 following direction dirleft"
"You may move from location pos21 to location pos11 following direction dirleft"
"You may move from location pos11 to location pos12 following direction dirdown"
"You may move from location pos12 to location pos13 following direction dirdown"
"You may move from location pos13 to location pos23 following direction dirright"
"You may move from location pos23 to location pos33 following direction dirright"
"You may move from location pos33 to location pos43 following direction dirright"

Directions are all correct. So our plan is:

```
move player1 pos41 pos31 dirleft
move player1 pos31 pos21 dirleft
move player1 pos21 pos11 dirleft
move player1 pos11 pos12 dirdown
move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown
move player1 pos13 pos23 dirright
move player1 pos23 pos33 dirright
move player1 pos33 pos43 dirright
pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos44 pos45 dirright
```

Let me validate the last action:

"pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos44 pos45 dirright" 

This says player1, situated at pos43, pushes stone1 from pos44 to goal location pos45, following direction dirright. 

Let's see if this meets the preconditions:

1. agent p is at location l_p: player1 is at location pos43 ✓
2. stone s is at location l_from: stone1 is at location pos44 ✓
3. location l_to is clear: pos45 is clear ✓
4. you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d: from pos43 to pos44 following dirright ✓
5. you can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d: from pos44 to pos45 following dirright ✓
6. location l_to is a goal location: pos45 is a goal location ✓

All preconditions are satisfied. So our plan is correct.

One last check: The position names are a bit confusing. I've been assuming that the first digit is the column and the second is the row, but in one part o the problem statement I saw a mapping that seemed more like the inverse. Let me verify:

- "You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright"

If pos11 is like (1, 1) and pos21 is like (2, 1), then dirright means the first digit increases.

- "You may move from location pos11 to location pos12 following direction dirdown"

If pos11 is like (1, 1) and pos12 is like (1, 2), then dirdown means the second digit increases.

So it seems the first digit is the column and the second is the row. But wait:

Initial state has pos41 as the player position. That would be (4, 1) in the above grid. Is that correct?

Let's re-read:

- "player1 is at location pos41"
- "stone1 is at location pos44"

So we're saying the player is at the position in the 4th column, 1st row, and the stone is at the position in the 4th column, 4th row. Given this, I'm interpreting the grid like:
```
(1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (4,1) (5,1)
(1,2) (2,2) (3,2) (4,2) (5,2)
(1,3) (2,3) (3,3) (4,3) (5,3)
(1,4) (2,4) (3,4) (4,4) (5,4)
(1,5) (2,5) (3,5) (4,5) (5,5)
```

where (column, row) is represented as posCR. The goal state is pos45, so that's (4, 5).

Given this interpretation, I need to revise our plan:

```
move player1 pos41 pos31 dirleft
move player1 pos31 pos21 dirleft
move player1 pos21 pos11 dirleft
move player1 pos11 pos12 dirdown
move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown
move player1 pos13 pos23 dirright
move player1 pos23 pos33 dirright
move player1 pos33 pos43 dirright
pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos44 pos45 dirdown
```

That ninth action is now dirdown, not dirright. This is because:

1. agent p is at location l_p: player1 is at location pos43 ✓
2. stone s is at location l_from: stone1 is at location pos44 ✓
3. location l_to is clear: pos45 is clear ✓
4. you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d: from pos43 to pos44 following dirdown ✓ (pos43 is (4, 3) and pos44 is (4, 4))
5. you can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d: from pos44 to pos45 following dirdown ✓ (pos44 is (4, 4) and pos45 is (4, 5))
6. location l_to is a goal location: pos45 is a goal location ✓

So the revised plan is:
