Okay, let's try to figure out how to solve this planning problem. The goal is to get stone1 to a goal location, which in this case is pos45. The constraints are a bit tricky: we need pos45 to be not clear at some point, but before that happens, the agent (player1) must have been at pos13.

First, let's look at the initial state. Player1 starts at pos41, and stone1 is at pos44. The goal location is pos45. So we need to move stone1 from pos44 to pos45. But pos44 is currently clear (since the initial state says "Location pos44 is clear" but stone1 is there. Wait, no, the initial state says "stone1 is at location pos44" and "Location pos44 is clear" is not listed. Wait, the original state lists "Location pos44 is clear" as part of the initial state? Wait, no. Let me check again.

Looking at the original state, under "The original state of the world is the following":

- "player1 is at location pos41"
- "stone1 is at location pos44"
- Then a list of locations that are clear. The "Location pos44 is clear" is not listed here. Wait, the list includes "Location pos42 is clear", "Location pos43 is clear", "Location pos45 is clear", etc. But "pos44" is where stone1 is, so it's not clear. So in the initial state, pos44 is occupied by stone1. So stone1 is at pos44, which is not a goal location. The goal is to get it to a goal location, which is pos45.

So, the main task is to push stone1 from pos44 to pos45. But pos45 is a goal location. So the action would be "pushtogoal" since the destination is a goal. However, to perform that action, the agent needs to be adjacent to the stone and push it in the direction towards pos45.

Looking at the movement graph: pos44 can move to pos45 via direction dirdown. Wait, the movement directions: Let's check the allowed moves for pos44. The list includes:

"You may move from location pos44 to location pos34 following direction dirleft"
"You may move from location pos44 to location pos54 following direction dirright"
"You may move from location pos44 to location pos43 following direction dirup"
"You may move from location pos44 to location pos45 following direction dirdown"

So from pos44, moving down (dirdown) leads to pos45. So to push the stone from pos44 to pos45, the agent must be at pos44's up direction (dirup from pos44 is pos43?), wait no. Wait, the movement from pos43 to pos44 is via direction dirdown. Let me check:

Looking for the movement from pos43 to pos44: "You may move from location pos43 to location pos44 following direction dirdown". So to be at pos43 and move down to pos44. Therefore, if the agent is at pos43, they can push the stone from pos44 to pos45 by moving down (since the stone is at pos44, pushing down (dirdown) would move it to pos45. But wait, the "pushtogoal" action requires that the agent is at l_p (their current location), the stone is at l_from, and then the agent moves in direction d to get to l_from (so from l_p to l_from via direction d), then the stone moves from l_from to l_to via the same direction d. So for pushing from pos44 to pos45 (dirdown), the agent needs to be at pos34 (since from pos34, direction dirright would be to pos44?), wait no. Wait, let's see: to push the stone from pos44 to pos45 (direction dirdown), the agent needs to be at pos44's adjacent tile in the opposite direction of the push. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here.

Let me think: when you push a stone, the agent is adjacent to the stone and moves in the direction of the push. So if the stone is at pos44 and we want to push it down (dirdown) to pos45, the agent must be at pos43 (since pos43 is up from pos44). Wait, because pushing down from pos44 to pos45 would require the agent to be at pos44's up neighbor, which is pos43. Wait, pos44's up direction is pos43, yes. Because in the movement list, pos43 can move down to pos44. So the agent needs to be at pos43, then move down to pos44, pushing the stone down to pos45. So the action would be "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos44 pos45 dirdown".

But wait, let's check the preconditions for pushtogoal:

1. Agent p is at l_p: So player1 must be at pos43.
2. Stone s is at l_from (pos44).
3. l_to (pos45) is clear. Initially, pos45 is clear (as per the initial state).
4. You can get from l_p (pos43) to l_from (pos44) following direction d (dirdown). Yes, according to the movement rules, pos43 can move to pos44 via dirdown.
5. You can get from l_from (pos44) to l_to (pos45) via direction d (dirdown). Yes, pos44 can move to pos45 via dirdown.
6. l_to is a goal location. pos45 is a goal.

So this action would work. But first, we need to get the agent to pos43. Currently, the agent is at pos41. How can we get from pos41 to pos43?

Looking at the movement graph:

From pos41, the allowed moves are:

- dirleft to pos31
- dirright to pos51
- dirdown to pos42.

So from pos41, moving down to pos42 is possible. Then from pos42, possible moves:

- dirleft to pos32
- dirright to pos52
- dirup to pos41
- dirdown to pos43.

So from pos42, moving down (dirdown) to pos43. So the path would be:

pos41 -> pos42 (dirdown), then pos42 -> pos43 (dirdown). Then from pos43, push the stone down to pos45.

So the plan would be:

1. move player1 pos41 pos42 dirdown
2. move player1 pos42 pos43 dirdown
3. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos44 pos45 dirdown

But wait, after the first move, the agent is at pos42. Then moving to pos43. Then pushing the stone. That seems straightforward. But there's a constraint: pos45 must be not clear in some state, and before that, the agent must have been at pos13. Wait, the constraint says that if pos45 is not clear in some state, then in an earlier state, the agent was at pos13.

But in our current plan, pos45 is being filled by the stone in the third action. So when we do the pushtogoal action, pos45 becomes not clear (since the stone moves there). So in that state, pos45 is not clear. Therefore, according to the constraint, before that state, the agent must have been at pos13.

But in our current plan, the agent's path is pos41 -> pos42 -> pos43. They never go to pos13. So this plan doesn't satisfy the constraint. Therefore, we need to adjust the plan to include the agent being at pos13 at some point before pos45 becomes not clear.

Hmm. So the constraint is that whenever pos45 is not clear (which will happen when stone1 is placed there), there must be an earlier state where the agent was at pos13. So in our case, the pushtogoal action results in pos45 being occupied by stone1. Therefore, the agent must have been at pos13 before that action.

So we need to make the agent go to pos13 at some point before the final push.

But how? The agent starts at pos41. To get to pos13, they need to navigate through the grid. Let's see the possible paths.

Let me outline the grid layout based on movement directions. The locations are posXY where X is row and Y is column. So pos11 is row 1, column 1; pos12 is row 1, column 2; pos21 is row 2, column 1, etc.

Looking at movement options, for example:

- pos11 can go to pos21 (dirright) or pos12 (dirdown).
- pos12 can go to pos22 (dirright), pos11 (dirup), or pos13 (dirdown).
- So pos13 is row 1, column 3. To get to pos13 from pos12 (row 1, column 2) via dirdown? Wait, no. Wait, pos12 to pos13 via dirdown? Wait, maybe the directions are a bit confusing. Let's check the movement list.

Looking at "You may move from location pos12 to location pos13 following direction dirdown". Wait, that seems odd because pos12 and pos13 are in the same row (row 1), so moving down would take you to row 2. But according to this, moving from pos12 to pos13 is dirdown. That suggests that the grid is perhaps arranged in a way where directions are not cardinal. Maybe the directions are: dirup, dirdown, dirleft, dirright, but their actual movement is based on the grid connections as defined.

But given that the movement from pos12 to pos13 is via dirdown, perhaps the grid is connected in a way that down from pos12 leads to pos13. So maybe the grid is structured such that moving down from pos12 leads to pos13, right to pos22, etc. This is a bit non-standard, but the movement directions are given, so we have to follow them as per the problem's definitions.

So to reach pos13, the agent needs to start from pos12 and move down to pos13. But how to get to pos12 from pos41?

This seems quite a long path. Let's try to find a path from pos41 to pos13.

Starting at pos41:

Possible moves from pos41: pos31 (dirleft), pos51 (dirright), pos42 (dirdown).

Suppose we go to pos42 (dirdown). Then from pos42, moves: pos32 (dirleft), pos52 (dirright), pos41 (dirup), pos43 (dirdown).

If we go to pos43 (dirdown from pos42). Then from pos43, moves: pos33 (dirleft), pos53 (dirright), pos42 (dirup), pos44 (dirdown).

But pushing the stone is at pos44. But maybe after moving to pos43, the agent can go further. Alternatively, perhaps the agent needs to find a path to pos13.

Alternatively, maybe go from pos41 to pos31 (dirleft), then from pos31 to pos21 (dirleft), then pos21 to pos11 (dirleft?), but wait, movement from pos21: "You may move from location pos21 to location pos11 following direction dirleft", yes. Then from pos11 to pos12 (dirdown), then pos12 to pos13 (dirdown). So the path would be:

pos41 -> pos31 (dirleft)
pos31 -> pos21 (dirleft)
pos21 -> pos11 (dirleft)
pos11 -> pos12 (dirdown)
pos12 -> pos13 (dirdown)

That's 5 moves to reach pos13. Then after that, the agent needs to go back to pos43 to push the stone.

But this would add a lot of steps. However, the constraints require that the agent was at pos13 before pos45 becomes not clear. So the agent must visit pos13 before pushing the stone to pos45.

So the plan would have to include a detour where the agent goes to pos13, then returns to pos43 to push the stone.

But how to make this optimal? The challenge is to find the shortest possible path that satisfies the constraints.

Let's see: the minimal plan would require moving to pos13, then moving back to pos43, then pushing the stone. But how many steps would that take?

Alternatively, perhaps the agent can go from pos41 to pos42, then pos43, then push the stone. But that doesn't satisfy the constraint. So we need to insert a visit to pos13.

Wait, maybe after moving to pos43, the agent can go up to pos42, then start moving towards pos13.

But this seems complex. Let's outline a possible path:

1. Move from pos41 to pos42 (dirdown)
2. Move from pos42 to pos43 (dirdown)
3. Then, from pos43, move up to pos42, then left to pos32 (dirleft), then up to pos31 (dirup), then left to pos21 (dirleft), then left to pos11 (dirleft), then down to pos12 (dirdown), then down to pos13 (dirdown). That's 7 moves to reach pos13.

Then from pos13, the agent needs to go back to pos43. That would be a long way. But maybe there's a shorter path. Alternatively, once at pos13, maybe go through different directions.

Alternatively, from pos13, move up to pos12 (dirup), then right to pos22 (dirright), then down to pos23 (dirdown), then right to pos24 (dirright?), but this is getting too vague.

Alternatively, maybe there's a more efficient path. Let's think again.

The agent needs to reach pos13, then get to pos43 to push the stone. Let's see:

From pos41 to pos42 (dirdown), then pos42 to pos43 (dirdown). Then from pos43, the agent could move to pos33 (dirleft), then to pos23 (dirleft), then to pos13 (dirleft). Wait:

pos43 -> pos33 (dirleft)
pos33 -> pos23 (dirleft)
pos23 -> pos13 (dirleft)

Yes! Because according to the movement rules, from pos43 you can go to pos33 via dirleft. Then from pos33 to pos23 via dirleft. Then from pos23 to pos13 via dirleft. So that's three moves from pos43 to pos13.

So the path would be:

1. move player1 pos41 pos42 dirdown
2. move player1 pos42 pos43 dirdown
3. move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft
4. move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft
5. move player1 pos23 pos13 dirleft

Now the agent is at pos13. Then, the agent needs to go back to pos43 to push the stone. How?

From pos13, they can move to pos23 (dirright?), wait, the movement from pos13 is:

"You may move from location pos13 to location pos23 following direction dirright"
"You may move from location pos13 to location pos12 following direction dirup"
"You may move from location pos13 to location pos14 following direction dirdown"

So from pos13, the agent can go to pos23 (dirright), then from pos23 to pos24 (dirdown?), or pos23 to pos22 (dirup), etc.

But the agent needs to get back to pos43. Let's see:

From pos13 to pos23 (dirright)
From pos23 to pos24 (dirdown) → pos24
From pos24 to pos34 (dirright)
From pos34 to pos44 (dirright)
But then pos44 has the stone, which is blocking. Wait, the stone is at pos44 initially. So the agent can't move into pos44 unless it's clear. But pos44 is occupied by the stone, so the agent can't move there. So that's a problem.

Alternatively, from pos23, the agent can go to pos24 (dirdown), then pos24 to pos34 (dirright), then pos34 to pos44 (dirright), but pos44 is blocked by the stone. So that's not possible.

Alternative path from pos13:

pos13 → pos14 (dirdown)
pos14 → pos24 (dirright)
pos24 → pos34 (dirright)
pos34 → pos44 (dirright) → blocked by stone.

No. Alternatively, maybe go from pos13 to pos12 (dirup), pos12 to pos22 (dirright), pos22 to pos32 (dirright), pos32 to pos42 (dirright), pos42 to pos43 (dirdown).

That's a longer path. Let's count:

pos13 → pos12 (dirup)
pos12 → pos22 (dirright)
pos22 → pos32 (dirright)
pos32 → pos42 (dirright)
pos42 → pos43 (dirdown)
Total of 5 moves.

But this seems time-consuming. Let's see if there's a shorter way.

Alternatively, from pos13, go to pos23 (dirright), then pos23 to pos24 (dirdown), pos24 to pos34 (dirright), pos34 to pos44 (dirright) → but pos44 has stone. So can't go there. Alternatively, from pos34, move down to pos35 (dirdown?), but the movement options from pos34:

"You may move from location pos34 to location pos24 following direction dirleft"
"You may move from location pos34 to location pos44 following direction dirright"
"You may move from location pos34 to location pos33 following direction dirup"
"You may move from location pos34 to location pos35 following direction dirdown"

So from pos34, the agent can go to pos35 (dirdown). Then pos35 can go to pos45 (dirright), but pos45 is clear. But pos35 is not connected to pos45 via dirright. Looking at movement rules:

From pos35: "You may move from location pos35 to location pos25 following direction dirleft", "You may move from location pos35 to location pos45 following direction dirright", "You may move from location pos35 to location pos34 following direction dirup".

So pos35 to pos45 via dirright. So agent at pos35 can move dirright to pos45. Then from pos45, the agent can move dirleft to pos35, or dirright to pos55, or dirup to pos44.

But pos44 has the stone. So if the agent gets to pos35, then pos45, then pos44 (if possible), but pos44 is occupied by the stone.

Alternatively, from pos34, agent goes to pos44 (dirright), but that's blocked. So perhaps another path.

Alternatively, after reaching pos13, the agent can go back to pos23, then pos24, pos34, pos35, pos45. Let's see:

pos13 → pos23 (dirright)
pos23 → pos24 (dirdown)
pos24 → pos34 (dirright)
pos34 → pos35 (dirdown)
pos35 → pos45 (dirright)
Then from pos45, the agent can move dirup to pos44 (if pos44 is clear). But pos44 is occupied by the stone. So that's not possible.

Alternatively, once the agent is at pos45, they can't get to pos44. So this path doesn't help.

Alternatively, after reaching pos13, agent needs to return to pos43. Let's see:

pos13 → pos23 (dirright)
pos23 → pos33 (dirright)
pos33 → pos43 (dirright)
Yes, because from pos33, you can go to pos43 via dirright. Wait, checking movement rules:

From pos33: "You may move from location pos33 to location pos23 following direction dirleft", "You may move from location pos33 to location pos43 following direction dirright", "You may move from location pos33 to location pos32 following direction dirup", "You may move from location pos33 to location pos34 following direction dirdown".

Yes, pos33 to pos43 via dirright. So the path could be:

pos13 → pos23 (dirright)
pos23 → pos33 (dirright)
pos33 → pos43 (dirright)

That's three moves. So after reaching pos13, the agent can go to pos23, then pos33, then pos43. Then from pos43, push the stone.

So the total steps would be:

Initial moves to reach pos13:

1. move from pos41 to pos42 (dirdown)
2. move to pos43 (dirdown)
3. move to pos33 (dirleft)
4. move to pos23 (dirleft)
5. move to pos13 (dirleft)

Then from pos13 to pos43:

6. move to pos23 (dirright)
7. move to pos33 (dirright)
8. move to pos43 (dirright)

Then push the stone:

9. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos44 pos45 dirdown

So total of 9 actions. But this seems long. Is there a shorter way?

Alternatively, perhaps the agent can reach pos13 via a different path that requires fewer steps.

Let's think again. Starting at pos41:

Option 1: pos41 → pos31 (dirleft) → pos21 (dirleft) → pos11 (dirleft) → pos12 (dirdown) → pos13 (dirdown). That's 5 moves.

Then from pos13, go to pos23 (dirright) → pos33 (dirright) → pos43 (dirright). 3 moves. Then push. Total steps: 5+3+1=9 moves, same as before.

Another option: from pos41, move to pos42 (dirdown), then pos43 (dirdown), then pos33 (dirleft), pos23 (dirleft), pos13 (dirleft). Then back to pos23, pos33, pos43. That's 5 steps to reach pos13, then 3 to return, then push. Total 9.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a way to visit pos13 while en route to pos43, but I'm not seeing it.

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to visit pos13 earlier and then proceed to pos43 without backtracking as much.

Wait, but after the agent is at pos13, they need to get back to pos43. The shortest path from pos13 to pos43 seems to be pos13 → pos23 → pos33 → pos43, which is 3 moves.

So the minimal plan would require 5 moves to get to pos13, 3 to return, and 1 to push, totaling 9. But the problem requires an optimal plan (shortest possible). Is there a shorter way?

Wait, the constraint says that in at least one state, pos45 is not clear. That happens when the stone is pushed there. And before that state, the agent must have been at pos13.

So the agent needs to have been at pos13 at some point before the pushtogoal action. So the agent can visit pos13 earlier in the plan, not necessarily immediately before the push.

Perhaps the agent can go to pos13 first, then go to pos43 and push the stone. Let's see.

Alternative path:

1. move from pos41 to pos42 (dirdown)
2. move to pos43 (dirdown)
3. move to pos33 (dirleft)
4. move to pos23 (dirleft)
5. move to pos13 (dirleft)
6. move back to pos23 (dirright)
7. move to pos33 (dirright)
8. move to pos43 (dirright)
9. pushtogoal...

But this is the same as before.

Alternatively, after step 5 (agent at pos13), maybe find a different path to pos43. For example:

pos13 → pos14 (dirdown)
pos14 → pos24 (dirright)
pos24 → pos34 (dirright)
pos34 → pos44 (dirright) → blocked by stone
No good.

Alternatively, pos13 → pos12 (dirup)
pos12 → pos22 (dirright)
pos22 → pos32 (dirright)
pos32 → pos42 (dirright)
pos42 → pos43 (dirdown)

That's 5 moves from pos13 to pos43. So total steps would be 5 (to pos13) +5 (back) +1=11, which is worse.

So the previous path of 9 steps seems better.

But is there a way to reduce the number of steps?

Wait, perhaps when moving from pos41 to pos43, then to pos33, pos23, pos13, then to pos23, pos33, pos43 again. That's 5 moves to reach pos13 and 3 to return. But maybe some steps can be combined.

Alternatively, maybe after reaching pos13, the agent can go back through a different route. But I don't see a shorter path.

Alternatively, maybe the agent doesn't need to go all the way back to pos43. For example, after reaching pos13, can the agent push the stone from a different direction?

But the stone is at pos44. To push it to pos45, the agent needs to be at pos43 (since that's the only adjacent cell from which pushing down would move the stone to pos45). So the agent must get to pos43 to perform the push.

So the minimal path seems to be 9 steps. But perhaps there's a smarter way.

Wait, let's consider if the agent can reach pos13 earlier, perhaps using a different route.

From pos41, if the agent goes dirleft to pos31, then dirleft to pos21, dirleft to pos11, then dirdown to pos12, then dirdown to pos13. That's 5 moves. Then, from pos13, the agent needs to get to pos43. The shortest path is pos13→pos23→pos33→pos43 (3 moves). Then push. Total 5+3+1=9.

Alternatively, from pos41, can the agent go to pos42, then pos43, then pos33, pos23, pos13 (5 moves). Then back to pos23, pos33, pos43 (3 moves), then push. Again 9.

Is there any way to visit pos13 and then go directly to pos43 without the three moves? Not that I can see.

Another angle: the constraint is that at least once before pos45 is not clear, the agent was at pos13. So the agent can visit pos13 at any point before the push, even much earlier. So perhaps the agent can visit pos13 first, then proceed to pos43, then push.

But how to visit pos13 first from the starting position.

The starting position is pos41. To get to pos13, the agent has to go through multiple steps. The earlier path of 5 steps to pos13 is the fastest.

So the plan would be:

1. move player1 pos41 pos42 dirdown
2. move player1 pos42 pos43 dirdown
3. move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft
4. move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft
5. move player1 pos23 pos13 dirleft
6. move player1 pos13 pos23 dirright
7. move player1 pos23 pos33 dirright
8. move player1 pos33 pos43 dirright
9. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos44 pos45 dirdown

This plan has 9 actions. But is there a shorter way?

Wait, maybe the agent can visit pos13 earlier and then proceed to pos43 via a different path. Let's see.

For example:

1. move from pos41 to pos31 (dirleft)
2. move to pos21 (dirleft)
3. move to pos11 (dirleft)
4. move to pos12 (dirdown)
5. move to pos13 (dirdown)
6. move to pos23 (dirright)
7. move to pos33 (dirright)
8. move to pos43 (dirright)
9. pushtogoal...

This is also 9 steps. So no improvement.

Is there a way to combine steps? For instance, after step 5 (agent at pos13), can they move directly to pos23, then pos33, pos43.

Yes, that's the same as before.

So regardless of the initial path to pos13, it takes 5 steps, then 3 steps back to pos43, then push. Total 9.

But is there a way to reduce this?

Wait, maybe the agent can visit pos13 on the way to pos43. For example, after moving to pos43, go to pos33, pos23, pos13, then back. But that seems the same.

Alternatively, let's think of a different approach. Suppose the agent pushes the stone to a non-goal location first, then to the goal. But the goal is only pos45. However, the constraints require that pos45 is not clear in some state, which would be when the stone is there. But the agent needs to have been at pos13 before that.

But maybe if the agent pushes the stone to a non-goal location first, then pushes it again to the goal. But this would require more steps, but perhaps allows fulfilling the constraint.

For example, the agent could push the stone from pos44 to pos54 (dirright), which is a non-goal. Then push it back to pos44, then to pos45. But that would take more steps.

Alternatively, push from pos44 to pos54 (dirright) using pushtonongoal, then from pos54 to pos55 (dirdown) using pushtonongoal, but pos55 is not a goal. Then finally push to pos45. But this would take more steps and not be optimal.

So this approach is likely not optimal.

Alternatively, perhaps the agent can push the stone to pos45, but before that, visit pos13. But the only way to push to pos45 is from pos44, requiring the agent to be at pos43. So the agent must visit pos13 before pushing.

So the minimal plan is 9 steps. But maybe there's a shorter way.

Wait, let's think: what if the agent takes a different path to pos13, but uses fewer steps?

From pos41 to pos42 (dirdown) → 1 step.

pos42 to pos43 (dirdown) → 2 steps.

pos43 to pos33 (dirleft) → 3.

pos33 to pos23 (dirleft) →4.

pos23 to pos13 (dirleft) →5.

Then back:

pos13 → pos23 (dirright) →6.

pos23 → pos33 (dirright) →7.

pos33 → pos43 (dirright) →8.

Then push →9.

So 9 steps.

But can any steps be merged? For example, when moving back from pos13 to pos43, perhaps there's a more direct path.

Alternatively, after reaching pos13, the agent can move to pos14 (dirdown), then pos24 (dirright), then pos34 (dirright), then pos44 (dirright) (but blocked), so no. Alternatively, pos14 to pos24 to pos34 to pos44 (blocked). No.

Alternatively, from pos13 to pos14 (dirdown), pos14 to pos15 (dirdown), pos15 to pos25 (dirright), pos25 to pos35 (dirright), pos35 to pos45 (dirright), then pos45 to pos44 (dirup). But pos44 is occupied by the stone. So this doesn't help.

Another thought: maybe the agent can reach pos13 via a different route that allows them to proceed to pos43 without backtracking. For example:

pos41 → pos42 → pos43 → pos33 → pos23 → pos13 (5 steps), then pos13 → pos23 → pos33 → pos43 (3 steps). Total 8 steps to reach pos43 again. Then push: 9 steps.

But that's the same as before.

I think the minimal plan is 9 steps. But let's verify if there's a shorter way.

Wait, what if after reaching pos13, the agent uses a different path to get to pos43. For example:

pos13 → pos12 (dirup)

pos12 → pos22 (dirright)

pos22 → pos32 (dirright)

pos32 → pos42 (dirright)

pos42 → pos43 (dirdown)

That's 5 steps from pos13 to pos43. But this would make the total steps 5 (to pos13) +5 (back) +1=11, which is longer than the previous 9.

So the 9-step plan seems to be the minimal.

But perhaps there's a way to visit pos13 during the initial movement towards pos43, thereby combining some steps.

Wait, after moving from pos41 to pos42 (step1), pos42 to pos43 (step2), then the agent is at pos43. Then moving to pos33 (step3), pos23 (step4), pos13 (step5). Then back to pos23 (step6), pos33 (step7), pos43 (step8). Then push (step9). So steps 1-9.

Alternatively, maybe after step5 (agent at pos13), can they move directly to pos43 in fewer steps. For example:

pos13 → pos23 (step6)

pos23 → pos33 (step7)

pos33 → pos43 (step8)

Then push (step9).

So steps 6-8 are moving back. That's the same as before.

So no improvement.

Therefore, the minimal valid plan that satisfies the constraints has 9 steps. However, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, what if the agent can visit pos13 while moving to pos43 in the first place? For example, the agent could take a detour to pos13 on the way to pos43. Let's see:

Starting at pos41:

1. move to pos42 (dirdown)
2. move to pos43 (dirdown)
3. move to pos33 (dirleft)
4. move to pos23 (dirleft)
5. move to pos13 (dirleft) → now at pos13 (step5)
6. move to pos23 (dirright)
7. move to pos33 (dirright)
8. move to pos43 (dirright)
9. pushtogoal...

Yes, same 9 steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the agent can move from pos13 to pos43 directly. But according to the movement rules, is there a path from pos13 to pos43 in one step? Unlikely. They are too far apart.

So it's not possible.

Therefore, the minimal plan is 9 steps. But let's check if the constraints are met.

In the plan:

After step9, the pushtogoal action, pos45 is not clear (it has the stone). So the constraint requires that in some state before that, the agent was at pos13. The agent was at pos13 in step5. Step5 occurs before step9, so the constraint is satisfied.

Additionally, the constraint requires that at least one state where pos45 is not clear. That's achieved in step9, since after pushing, stone1 is at pos45.

Thus, this plan meets all the constraints and is valid.

But is there a way to make it shorter? Let's think again.

Wait, perhaps the agent can visit pos13 during the initial journey to pos43, thereby saving steps.

For example:

Agent starts at pos41.

1. move to pos42 (dirdown)
2. move to pos43 (dirdown)
3. move to pos33 (dirleft)
4. move to pos23 (dirleft)
5. move to pos13 (dirleft) → step5, agent is at pos13.
6. move to pos23 (dirright)
7. move to pos33 (dirright)
8. move to pos43 (dirright)
9. pushtogoal...

This is 9 steps. Is there a way to merge steps 3-5 into fewer moves?

No, because each move is between adjacent locations. So it's mandatory to move step by step.

Alternatively, perhaps the agent can move from pos43 to pos33 to pos23 to pos13 (3 steps), then from pos13 back to pos23 to pos33 to pos43 (3 steps). That's 6 steps plus the initial 2 steps (pos41 to pos43) and the final push. Total 2+3+3+1=9 steps.

Yes, same as before.

Hmm. So I think this is the minimal plan. But maybe there's another approach.

Wait, what if the agent uses pushtonongoal to move the stone to a non-goal location, then to the goal. For example, push the stone to pos54 (dirright from pos44), then from pos54 to pos55 (dirdown), then to pos45 (dirleft). But pos55 is not a goal, so we can't use pushtogoal there. Also, moving the stone to pos55 would require another action to get it to pos45, which is a goal. But pos55 is not adjacent to pos45. From pos55, the only direction to pos45 is dirleft. So pos55 to pos45 is dirleft. So agent would need to be at pos55 to push left to pos45, but pos55 is a non-goal. Wait, but pos45 is a goal. So pushing from pos55 to pos45 would require the agent to be at pos55's right side (dirleft direction). But pos55's left is pos54. So to push from pos55 to pos45, the agent would need to be at pos55 and push left. But pos55's left is pos54, which is non-goal. So that's not helpful.

Alternatively, if the stone is at pos54 (non-goal), the agent can push it to pos55 (non-goal), then pos55 to pos45 (dirleft). But pos55 to pos45 is not a valid direction according to the movement rules. Let's check:

From pos55: "You may move from location pos55 to location pos45 following direction dirleft". So yes. So if the agent is at pos55, they can push the stone to pos45 (dirleft). But to do that, the agent must be at pos55's right (pos55's right would be pos55's adjacent in dirright direction, which is pos55 itself? No. Wait, the movement from pos55 is: "You may move from location pos55 to location pos45 following direction dirleft", which suggests that dirleft from pos55 is to pos45. So to push the stone from pos55 to pos45 (dirleft), the agent must be at pos55's dirleft direction's opposite. Wait, I'm getting confused again.

Actually, for the push action, the agent needs to be at a location adjacent to the stone's current position in the opposite direction of the push. For example, to push the stone from pos55 to pos45 (dirleft), the agent must be at pos55's right side, which is pos55 itself. But that's impossible. Wait, no. The movement rules for pushing require that the agent is at l_p, which is adjacent to l_from (the stone's current position) via direction d. So for pushing the stone from pos55 to pos45 via dirleft, the agent must be at pos55's right neighbor. But pos55's right neighbor is not present (since pos55 is in column 5, row 5). According to the movement rules, pos55 can only move to pos45 via dirleft. So there's no pos65 or anything. So the only way to push from pos55 to pos45 is if the agent is at pos55's right, but there's no such location. So this is impossible.

Therefore, pushing the stone from pos55 to pos45 is not possible. Hence, that approach won't work.

So the only feasible way is to push the stone directly from pos44 to pos45, which requires the agent to be at pos43.

Thus, the minimal plan is indeed 9 steps.
