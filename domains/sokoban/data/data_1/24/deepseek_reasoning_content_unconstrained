Okay, let's see. The problem is to move stone1 from pos42 to a goal location. The only goal location mentioned is pos12. So the stone needs to get there. The initial state has the agent at pos22.

First, I need to figure out how the agent can move to push the stone. The stone is at pos42. The agent needs to be adjacent to it to push. Let's look at the movement possibilities.

From pos42, which directions can the agent approach? The possible moves to pos42 are from pos52 (dirleft), pos32 (dirright), pos41 (dirdown), or pos43 (dirup). But in the initial state, the agent is at pos22. So the agent needs to navigate to a position adjacent to pos42 to push the stone towards pos12.

Let me check the movement paths. Starting at pos22, possible moves are to pos12 (dirleft), pos32 (dirright), pos21 (dirup), or pos23 (dirdown). The agent needs to get to pos32 or pos52 or pos41 or pos43 to push the stone. Let's see the most direct path.

From pos22, moving right (dirright) takes the agent to pos32. From pos32, moving right again (dirright) would take them to pos42. Wait, but pos42 has the stone. So to push the stone, the agent needs to be in a position where they can push it towards the goal. Wait, no. Wait, the stone is at pos42. If the agent is at pos32, which is to the left of pos42, then they could push the stone to the right (dirright) to pos52? But pos52 is not a goal. Alternatively, if the agent is at pos32, pushing the stone up (dirup) to pos33? No, but the directions allowed depend on the movement connections.

Wait, looking at the movement connections: From pos32, you can move to pos22 (dirleft), pos42 (dirright), pos31 (dirup), or pos33 (dirdown). So if the agent is at pos32, they can push the stone at pos42 by moving right (dirright) to pos42, but that's where the stone is. Wait, no. The pushtogoal action requires the agent to be at l_p, which is adjacent to l_from (the stone's current location). The direction d must be from l_p to l_from, and then from l_from to l_to. So for example, if the agent is at pos32, and the stone is at pos42, the direction from pos32 to pos42 is dirright. Then the stone would be pushed in the same direction (dirright) to pos52. But pos52 is not a goal. Alternatively, maybe pushing the stone upwards? Wait, but the direction has to be such that you can move from l_p to l_from (agent's position to stone's position) and then from l_from to l_to (stone's position to target). So if the agent is at pos32 (east of pos42?), no. Wait, positions are labeled as pos11, pos12, etc., where the first digit is row and the second is column. So pos32 is row 3, column 2. pos42 is row 4, column 2. So the agent at pos32 (row3, col2) can move down (dirdown) to pos42? Wait, looking at the allowed moves: "You may move from location pos32 to location pos42 following direction dirright". Wait, direction names might be a bit confusing. Let me check. For example, from pos32 to pos42: direction is dirright? That seems odd because pos32 is (3,2), pos42 is (4,2), which is down. Wait, perhaps the direction names are based on movement in the grid. Maybe dirright is moving east (same row, next column), dirleft is west, dirup is north (previous row), dirdown is south (next row). Wait, that would make more sense. Let's check some connections.

Looking at the movement from pos22 to pos32 is dirright. pos22 is (2,2), pos32 is (3,2). Wait, that's moving down a row, which would be south. But the direction is called dirright. Hmm, maybe the directions are labeled differently. Alternatively, perhaps the movement is based on moving in a grid where directions are up/down/left/right as in the grid's rows and columns. For example, moving right would increase the column number. So pos22 (row 2, column 2) moving right would go to pos23 (row2, column3). Let's check the movement connections. For example, from pos22, you can move to pos12 (dirleft?), but looking at the movement list: "You may move from location pos22 to location pos12 following direction dirleft". So pos22 (row2, column2) to pos12 (row1, column2) is dirleft. That seems like moving up, but the direction is called left. Wait, this is confusing. Maybe the directions are named as if the grid is laid out with rows going from top to bottom and columns left to right, but movement directions are relative. For example, moving left from pos22 (row2, column2) would take you to pos21 (same row, column1), but according to the given movement, moving from pos22 to pos12 is dirleft. Wait, that's not matching. Let's look at the movement from pos22 to pos12. That's moving from (2,2) to (1,2), which is up a row. But the direction is dirleft. That doesn't make sense. Maybe the direction names are arbitrary labels, and the actual movement connections are given in the problem. So the actual possible moves are defined by the given "You may move from..." statements, regardless of the direction names. So, for example, from pos22, the allowed moves are to pos12 (dirleft), pos32 (dirright), pos21 (dirup), pos23 (dirdown). So dirleft from pos22 is to pos12 (up), dirright is to pos32 (down), dirup is to pos21 (left?), dirdown is to pos23 (right?). This is very confusing. The direction labels may not correspond to the usual cardinal directions.

Alternatively, perhaps the direction labels are just names, and the actual movement is determined by the given connections. So the agent can move in any direction as long as the movement is allowed as per the problem's stated connections.

Therefore, when planning, the agent needs to follow the allowed movement paths as per the given connections, regardless of the direction labels' actual meaning.

So, the agent is at pos22. The stone is at pos42. The goal is to get the stone to pos12, which is a goal location. So the agent needs to move to a position where they can push the stone towards pos12.

Let me try to find a path for the agent to reach a position adjacent to the stone. The stone is at pos42. The adjacent positions are pos32 (up), pos52 (down?), pos41 (left?), pos43 (right?).

Wait, pos42 is row4, column2. Adjacent positions would be:

- North (row3, column2): pos32

- South (row5, column2): pos52

- East (row4, column3): pos43

- West (row4, column1): pos41

But according to the allowed movements from pos42:

"You may move from location pos42 to location pos32 following direction dirleft" (since pos42 can move to pos32 via dirleft). Also, from pos42, you can move to pos52 via dirright, to pos41 via dirup, and to pos43 via dirdown.

Wait, but the movement from pos42 to pos32 is dirleft. So to get to pos32, the agent would need to move from pos42's adjacent positions. Wait, no. The agent is currently at pos22. To reach pos32, which is adjacent to the stone's location (pos42), the agent needs to move from pos22 to pos32. According to the movement list, from pos22, moving dirright takes the agent to pos32. So that's possible.

So first step: move from pos22 to pos32 using dirright.

Now, agent is at pos32. From here, can the agent push the stone? The stone is at pos42. The movement from pos32 to pos42 is allowed via dirright. So the agent is at pos32, and can push the stone from pos42 (since the agent is at pos32, and the stone is at pos42, which is adjacent in the dirright direction. Wait, but according to the movement connections, from pos32 to pos42 is dirright. So the direction from agent's current position (pos32) to stone's position (pos42) is dirright.

So, to push the stone from pos42 to pos43 (dirdown?), but wait, the movement from pos42 to pos43 is dirdown. But pos43 is a non-goal location. The goal is pos12. So pushing the stone to pos43 isn't helpful. Alternatively, pushing the stone towards the north (pos32?) but the stone is already at pos42; pushing north would require the agent to be south of the stone. Wait, maybe the agent needs to get to pos52 (south of pos42) and push north. Let's think.

Alternatively, the agent can push the stone from pos42 to pos32 (dirleft direction). But pos32 is not a goal. The only goal is pos12. So the agent needs to get the stone from pos42 to pos12. Let's think of the path.

The stone is at pos42. To get to pos12, which is up in the grid. So the path would be pos42 → pos32 → pos22 → pos12. Each time, the agent needs to push the stone upwards. So the agent needs to position themselves south of the stone to push it north.

Wait, but in the movement connections, moving from pos42 to pos32 is dirleft. So to push the stone from pos42 to pos32, the agent needs to be at pos42's south (pos52) and push north, but according to the movement directions, that might not be possible. Wait, perhaps I need to model each push step.

Let me outline a possible plan step by step.

First, the agent is at pos22. The stone is at pos42.

Step 1: Move agent from pos22 to pos32 via dirright. Now agent is at pos32.

Now, to push the stone at pos42 to pos32 (which is north), the agent needs to be south of the stone. Wait, but the agent is at pos32, which is north of pos42. To push the stone north, the agent would need to be south of it and push north. But in this case, the agent is north of the stone. So perhaps the directions are such that pushing requires the agent to be adjacent in the direction of the push.

Wait, the action "pushtogoal" requires that the agent is at l_p, which is adjacent to l_from (the stone's current location) in direction d. Then the stone is pushed from l_from to l_to, also in direction d. So for example, if the agent is at pos32, and the stone is at pos42, then the direction from pos32 to pos42 is dirright (as per movement connections). So the agent is at pos32, and the stone is at pos42. Then, the direction d is dirright. So the agent can push the stone from pos42 to pos52 (following dirright), but pos52 is not a goal. Alternatively, the agent could push in a different direction? Wait, no. The direction d must be the same for moving from l_p to l_from and from l_from to l_to. So the direction from agent's location to stone's location is d, and then the stone moves in the same direction d to l_to.

So in this case, if the agent is at pos32 (l_p) and the stone is at pos42 (l_from), direction d is dirright (since that's the direction from pos32 to pos42). So pushing the stone would take it to pos52 (since pos42 to pos52 is dirright). But pos52 is not a goal. So that's not helpful.

Alternatively, the agent could move to pos43 (east of pos42) and push west. Wait, pos43 is east of pos42. So direction from pos43 to pos42 would be dirleft. Then pushing west would take the stone to pos41? No, pos42 to pos41 would be west. But according to movement connections, from pos42, you can move to pos41 via dirup. Hmm, this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, maybe the agent needs to move around to the other side of the stone. Let's see. The stone is at pos42. The agent is at pos32. To push the stone north (to pos32), the agent would need to be south of the stone (pos52) and push north. But how to get to pos52?

From pos32, the agent can move dirright to pos42, but that's where the stone is. So that's blocked. Alternatively, the agent can move from pos32 to pos33 (dirdown), then to pos43 (dirright), then to pos42 (dirup?), but need to check movement connections.

Wait, from pos32, movement options are:

- dirleft to pos22

- dirright to pos42

- dirup to pos31

- dirdown to pos33.

If the agent is at pos32, they can't move to pos42 because the stone is there. So they need to go around.

Alternative path: agent moves from pos22 to pos23 (dirdown), then to pos24 (dirdown), etc., but that's getting away from the stone.

Alternatively, the agent moves from pos22 to pos32 (dirright), then from pos32 to pos33 (dirdown), then from pos33 to pos43 (dirright). Now agent is at pos43. From here, can they push the stone west to pos42? Wait, the stone is already at pos42. So no. Wait, the stone is at pos42. So if the agent is at pos43, they can push the stone west to pos42, but that's where it is now. Not helpful.

Alternatively, the agent moves to pos52. Let's see how to get there. From pos22, the agent can move down to pos32, then to pos42 (if possible). But pos42 has the stone. So agent can't move there. Alternatively, agent moves from pos22 to pos23 (dirdown), then to pos24, etc., but that's not helpful.

Wait, perhaps the agent needs to go to pos52 to push the stone north. Let's see.

How to get to pos52. Starting at pos22:

Move dirright to pos32.

Then from pos32, move dirright to pos42. But pos42 has the stone, so it's blocked. Can't move there.

Alternatively, from pos32, move dirdown to pos33. Then dirright to pos43. Then dirright to pos53? Wait, movement from pos43 to pos53 is allowed via dirright. Then from pos53, move dirdown to pos54, etc. But that's not helpful.

Alternatively, from pos22, move dirright to pos32. Then from pos32, move dirup to pos31. Then dirright to pos41. Then dirdown to pos42. But again, pos42 is occupied by the stone.

Hmm. This is getting tricky. Maybe there's another approach. Let's look at the goal: stone1 must be at a goal location, which is pos12. So the stone needs to be moved from pos42 to pos12. The path would require moving it up through pos32, pos22, pos12.

So each time, the agent must push the stone north. To do that, the agent must be south of the stone and push north. So, for example, to push from pos42 to pos32, the agent must be at pos52 (south of pos42) and push north. But how does the agent get to pos52?

From pos42, moving south to pos52 is allowed via dirright. But the agent is at pos22 initially. To get to pos52, the agent needs to move right/down through various positions.

Alternative path:

Agent moves from pos22 → pos32 (dirright).

Then pos32 → pos33 (dirdown).

pos33 → pos43 (dirright).

pos43 → pos53 (dirright).

pos53 → pos52 (dirup). Now agent is at pos52.

From pos52, can the agent push the stone at pos42 north to pos32? Let's check the movement directions.

The agent is at pos52. The stone is at pos42. To push north, the direction from pos52 to pos42 would be dirup (since from pos52, moving up to pos42 is allowed. Let me check the movement connections:

Looking at the movement list, "You may move from location pos52 to location pos42 following direction dirleft". Wait, pos52 to pos42 is dirleft. So the direction from pos52 to pos42 is dirleft. Then pushing the stone in the same direction (dirleft) would take it from pos42 to pos32 (since pos42 to pos32 is dirleft according to movement connections). So yes.

So the agent is at pos52, stone at pos42. Action: pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos52 pos42 pos32 dirleft. Because pos32 is a goal location? Wait, no. pos32 is not a goal. Wait, the goal locations are only pos12. So pushing to pos32 isn't a goal. So this action would have to be pushtonongoal, but then we need to push again.

Wait, but the goal is to get the stone to a goal location, which is pos12. So the stone needs to be pushed all the way from pos42 → pos32 → pos22 → pos12. Each time, the agent needs to be south of the stone to push north.

So let's break it down step by step.

1. Move agent to pos52 to push the stone from pos42 to pos32 (non-goal).

2. Then, move agent to pos32 to push the stone from pos32 to pos22 (non-goal).

3. Then, move agent to pos22 to push the stone from pos22 to pos12 (goal).

But how does the agent get into position each time?

Let's try to outline each step:

First, move agent from pos22 to pos52. How?

From pos22, possible moves:

- dirleft to pos12.

- dirright to pos32.

- dirup to pos21.

- dirdown to pos23.

To get to pos52, need to go through pos32 → pos33 → pos43 → pos53 → pos52.

But let's check:

pos22 → pos32 (dirright).

pos32 → pos33 (dirdown).

pos33 → pos43 (dirright).

pos43 → pos53 (dirright).

pos53 → pos52 (dirup).

Now, agent is at pos52.

Now, perform pushtonongoal to push stone from pos42 to pos32. Since pos32 is not a goal.

Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos52 pos42 pos32 dirleft.

After this, the stone is at pos32, agent is at pos42.

Next, need to push the stone from pos32 to pos22. For that, the agent needs to be south of pos32 (i.e., at pos42) and push north (dirleft direction? Let's check movement from pos42 to pos32 is dirleft. So agent at pos42, stone at pos32. Wait, after the previous push, the agent is at pos42. The stone is at pos32. To push it further north to pos22, the agent needs to be south of pos32, which is pos42. So agent is already there. So next action would be pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos22 dirleft. Because direction from pos42 to pos32 is dirleft, and then from pos32 to pos22 is also dirleft (since movement from pos32 to pos22 is allowed via dirleft).

Wait, movement from pos32 to pos22 is dirleft. So yes, direction is dirleft.

After this push, stone is at pos22, agent is at pos32.

Now, the agent needs to push the stone from pos22 to pos12. The agent must be south of pos22 (i.e., at pos32) and push north (dirleft direction).

Action: pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos22 pos12 dirleft. Because pos12 is a goal location.

This seems like a valid plan. Let's check each action's preconditions.

First action: move from pos22 to pos32 via dirright.

Preconditions: agent is at pos22 (yes), pos32 is clear (yes, initial state says pos32 is clear), can move from pos22 to pos32 via dirright (yes).

Second action: move from pos32 to pos33 via dirdown. Wait, no. Wait, in the outlined steps above, after moving to pos32, the next steps are moving to pos33, etc., to reach pos52. Let's re-express the entire plan with all actions.

Wait, maybe my initial outline was too vague. Let's re-express the plan step by step.

Plan Steps:

1. Move player1 from pos22 to pos32 via dirright.

2. Move player1 from pos32 to pos33 via dirdown.

3. Move player1 from pos33 to pos43 via dirright.

4. Move player1 from pos43 to pos53 via dirright.

5. Move player1 from pos53 to pos52 via dirup.

6. Push stone1 from pos42 to pos32 using pushtonongoal. The agent is at pos52, direction dirleft (from pos52 to pos42 is dirleft?), then pos42 to pos32 is dirleft.

Wait, movement from pos52 to pos42 is allowed via dirleft. So the direction is dirleft. So the action would be pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos52 pos42 pos32 dirleft.

After this, the agent is at pos42, and the stone is at pos32.

7. Now, the agent is at pos42. To push the stone from pos32 to pos22, the agent needs to be south of pos32 (pos42) and push north. So direction from pos42 to pos32 is dirleft. So the action is pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos22 dirleft.

After this, the agent is at pos32, stone is at pos22.

8. Finally, push the stone from pos22 to pos12. The agent is at pos32. Direction from pos32 to pos22 is dirleft. So the action is pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos22 pos12 dirleft.

This results in the stone being at pos12, which is a goal location.

But wait, step 5: moving from pos53 to pos52 via dirup. Is that allowed? Let's check the movement connections.

Looking at the movement list:

From pos53: "You may move from location pos53 to location pos43 following direction dirleft", "You may move from location pos53 to location pos52 following direction dirup", and "You may move from location pos53 to location pos54 following direction dirdown".

So yes, moving from pos53 to pos52 via dirup is allowed.

Now, check each action's preconditions:

1. move player1 pos22 pos32 dirright:

- Player is at pos22 (yes).

- pos32 is clear (initial state says pos32 is clear).

- Can move from pos22 to pos32 via dirright (yes).

2. move player1 pos32 pos33 dirdown:

- Player is at pos32.

- pos33 is clear (initial state says pos33 is clear).

- Can move from pos32 to pos33 via dirdown (yes, according to movement list: from pos32 to pos33 is dirdown).

3. move player1 pos33 pos43 dirright:

- Player is at pos33.

- pos43 is clear (initial state says pos43 is clear).

- Can move from pos33 to pos43 via dirright (yes, movement list says from pos33 to pos43 via dirright).

4. move player1 pos43 pos53 dirright:

- Player is at pos43.

- pos53 is clear (initial state says pos53 is clear).

- Movement from pos43 to pos53 via dirright (yes).

5. move player1 pos53 pos52 dirup:

- Player is at pos53.

- pos52 is clear (initial state says pos52 is clear).

- Movement from pos53 to pos52 via dirup (yes).

6. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos52 pos42 pos32 dirleft:

- Agent is at pos52 (yes after step5).

- stone1 is at pos42 (initial state, but after movement steps, has it moved? Wait, no, the stone hasn't been moved yet. The first five steps are just the agent moving. The stone is still at pos42. So yes, stone is at pos42.

- pos32 is clear (initially yes, but after agent moved from pos32 to pos33, pos32 becomes clear again? Wait, after moving from pos32 to pos33, the agent leaves pos32, so pos32 is clear. So when we get to step6, pos32 is clear.

- The agent is at pos52 (l_p=pos52), stone is at l_from=pos42.

- Check if you can move from pos52 to pos42 via dirleft (yes, movement list says from pos52 to pos42 via dirleft).

- Check if you can move from pos42 to pos32 via dirleft (movement list: from pos42 to pos32 via dirleft? Yes.

- pos32 is not a goal location (correct, since only pos12 is a goal). So pushtonongoal is needed.

After this action, the agent moves to pos42, stone moves to pos32, and pos52 becomes clear.

7. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos22 dirleft:

- Agent is at pos42 (after step6).

- stone1 is at pos32 (after step6).

- pos22 is clear (initially pos22 is clear, and after agent moved away, yes).

- Can move from pos42 to pos32 via dirleft (movement list says from pos42 to pos32 via dirleft).

- Can move from pos32 to pos22 via dirleft (movement list: from pos32 to pos22 via dirleft? Let's check. From pos32's movement options: "You may move from location pos32 to location pos22 following direction dirleft". Yes.

- pos22 is not a goal (correct), so pushtonongoal.

After this, agent is at pos32, stone is at pos22.

8. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos22 pos12 dirleft:

- Agent is at pos32 (after step7).

- stone1 is at pos22 (after step7).

- pos12 is a goal location.

- Check preconditions: agent at pos32 (yes), stone at pos22 (yes), pos12 is clear (initially yes, but after previous steps? After step7, pos22 has the stone. pos12 is clear as long as no one is there. Let's see.

After step7, the stone is at pos22. pos12 was clear in initial state, and no actions have affected it except the agent moving from pos22 to pos32, leaving pos22 clear, but then in step6 and 7, the agent moves to pos52 and then to pos42, then to pos32. So pos12 remains clear.

So for step8:

- Agent is at pos32 (correct).

- stone at pos22 (correct).

- pos12 is clear (yes).

- Can move from pos32 to pos22 via dirleft (yes).

- Can move from pos22 to pos12 via dirleft (movement from pos22 to pos12 via dirleft, yes).

- pos12 is a goal (yes).

So this action is valid.

After this, stone is at pos12 (goal), agent is at pos22.

Thus, the plan has 8 actions. But is there a shorter way? Let's think.

The current plan has 8 steps: 5 move actions and 3 push actions. Maybe there's a shorter path.

Alternative approach: Find a way to push the stone with fewer moves.

Let me think again. The stone is at pos42, goal at pos12.

The agent needs to push the stone up three times: pos42 → pos32 → pos22 → pos12.

Each push requires the agent to be positioned south of the stone's current location to push north.

But to get to the south of the stone, the agent has to go around.

But maybe there's a quicker path.

Wait, after the first move to pos32 (step1), the agent is at pos32. Can the agent push the stone from pos42 to pos52? But pos52 is not a goal. But perhaps pushing it to pos52 and then another path? Not helpful.

Alternatively, can the agent move from pos32 to pos42 via dirright, but the stone is there. So that's not possible.

Alternative idea: The agent moves from pos22 to pos23 (dirdown), then to pos24, pos34, pos44, pos54, pos53, pos52. But that's longer.

Hmm. The initial plan seems to be the minimal path. But perhaps there's a smarter way.

Wait, after the first push (step6), the agent is at pos42. From there, to push the stone from pos32 to pos22, the agent needs to be south of pos32 (pos42 is south of pos32). So the agent is already in position. So step7 is possible. Then, after pushing to pos22, the agent is at pos32. From there, pushing to pos12 is possible.

So the plan is 5 move actions and 3 push actions. Total 8.

Is there a way to reduce the number of move actions?

For example, after moving to pos52 (step5), pushing to pos32 (step6), then agent is at pos42. From there, instead of moving to pos32 again, can the agent directly push again? For the next push from pos32 to pos22, the agent needs to be at pos42 (south of pos32). Yes, so after step6, agent is at pos42. So step7 can proceed.

Then, after step7, agent is at pos32. So step8 can proceed.

So the current plan is:

Move: 22→32→33→43→53→52 (5 moves).

Then push to 32 (step6), then push to 22 (step7), then push to12 (step8).

Total 5+3=8 actions.

Is there a shorter path?

Alternative approach: Can the agent reach pos52 with fewer moves?

From pos22, possible moves:

pos22 → pos32 (dirright) → pos42 (dirright). But pos42 has the stone. So can't move there. So that's blocked.

Alternative route: pos22 → pos23 (dirdown) → pos24 (dirdown) → pos34 (dirright) → pos44 (dirright) → pos54 (dirright) → pos55 (dirdown) → pos54 → ... no, that's longer.

Alternatively, pos22 → pos32 → pos33 → pos43 → pos53 → pos52 is 5 moves. That's the shortest path.

So perhaps the plan is optimal with 8 actions. I don't see a shorter way.
