Let's analyze this problem step by step:

1. We have a 2D grid with positions labeled as posXY where X is the row and Y is the column.
2. The player (player1) is at position pos22 (row 2, column 2).
3. There's a stone (stone1) at position pos42 (row 4, column 2).
4. The goal is at position pos12 (row 1, column 2), which makes sense as it's marked as a goal location.
5. We need to move the stone to the goal location.

The grid looks something like this (with P as player, S as stone, and G as goal):

```
| G | _ | _ | _ | _ |
| _ | P | _ | _ | _ |
| _ | _ | _ | _ | _ |
| _ | S | _ | _ | _ |
| _ | _ | _ | _ | _ |
```

To push the stone, the player needs to be adjacent to it and push it in a direction. Since the player is at pos22 and the stone is at pos42, the player needs to move to pos32 first to push the stone upward.

Let's plan the steps:

1. Move player1 from pos22 to pos32 (going down).
2. Push stone1 from pos42 to pos32 (going up).
3. Push stone1 from pos32 to pos22 (going up).
4. Push stone1 from pos22 to pos12 (going up).

Let's verify if these steps are valid:

Step 1: Move player1 from pos22 to pos32 (dirdown)
- player1 is at pos22 (true)
- pos32 is clear (true)
- You can get from pos22 to pos32 following dirdown (based on the rules, you can move from pos22 to pos32 following direction dirright, not dirdown). 

Wait, the dirdown might be confusing here. Let me revisit the rules about directions. 

Looking at the provided rules:
"You may move from location pos22 to location pos32 following direction dirright"

Actually, since the direction is dirright, this means to move horizontally from column 2 to column 2. This implies that pos32 is to the right of pos22, not below it. So the grid should look like:

```
| 11 | 12G | 13 | 14 | 15 |
| 21 | 22P | 23 | 24 | 25 |
| 31 | 32  | 33 | 34 | 35 |
| 41 | 42S | 43 | 44 | 45 |
| 51 | 52  | 53 | 54 | 55 |
```

Actually, examining the rules more closely:
"You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright"
"You may move from location pos11 to location pos12 following direction dirdown"

This implies that:
- dirright means moving from the first digit to the second digit (horizontally)
- dirdown means moving from the second digit to the third digit (vertically)

So, more accurately:
- pos11 to pos21 is moving right (increasing first digit)
- pos11 to pos12 is moving down (increasing second digit)

So the grid is:

```
| 11 | 21 | 31 | 41 | 51 |
| 12G| 22P| 32 | 42S| 52 |
| 13 | 23 | 33 | 43 | 53 |
| 14 | 24 | 34 | 44 | 54 |
| 15 | 25 | 35 | 45 | 55 |
```

Now, let's revisit our plan:

1. Move player1 from pos22 to pos32 (dirright).
2. Move player1 from pos32 to pos42 (dirright).
3. Push stone1 from pos42 to pos32 (dirleft).
4. Push stone1 from pos32 to pos22 (dirleft).
5. Push stone1 from pos22 to pos12 (dirleft).

Let's check if these actions are valid:

Step 1: Move player1 from pos22 to pos32 (dirright)
- player1 is at pos22 (true)
- pos32 is clear (true)
- You can get from pos22 to pos32 following dirright (true, as per the rules).

Step 2: Move player1 from pos32 to pos42 (dirright)
- After Step 1, player1 is at pos32
- pos42 has stone1, so it's not clear.

Wait, that's an issue. Let me reconsider the state of the world:

```
"player1 is at location pos22"
"stone1 is at location pos42"
"Location pos11 is clear"
"Location pos12 is clear"
...
```

The issue is that the state says that positions pos22 and pos42 are clear, but also that player1 is at pos22 and stone1 is at pos42. This is a contradiction. 

Let me reconsider:

It's likely that the predicates "Location posXY is clear" mean that the position doesn't have obstacles, walls, or other impassable entities. It doesn't necessarily mean there's no agent or stone there.

So let's reinterpret the grid:

```
| 11 | 21 | 31 | 41 | 51 |
| 12G| 22P| 32 | 42S| 52 |
| 13 | 23 | 33 | 43 | 53 |
| 14 | 24 | 34 | 44 | 54 |
| 15 | 25 | 35 | 45 | 55 |
```

Given this grid, our plan would be:

1. Move player1 from pos22 to pos32 (dirright).
2. Move player1 from pos32 to pos42 (dirright), with the understanding that that location has a stone.

Wait, this doesn't make sense either. Just re-reading the rules again:

"move p l_from l_to d": You may only perform this action if (i) agent p is at location l_from, (ii) location l_to is clear, and (iii) you can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d.

So if a location has a stone, it is not clear, and an agent can't move into it.

Let's just check the effects of the move action again:

"move p l_from l_to d": After performing this action, (i) agent p is no longer at location l_from, (ii) location l_to is no longer clear, (iii) agent p is at location l_to, and (iv) location l_from is clear.

So after an agent moves to a location, that location is no longer clear. This implies that a location is clear if there's no agent or stone on it.

Now, checking the original state again:

```
"player1 is at location pos22"
"stone1 is at location pos42"
"Location pos11 is clear"
"Location pos12 is clear"
...
"Location pos22 is clear"
"Location pos42 is clear"
```

This seems to be a contradiction. If player1 is at pos22, then pos22 cannot be clear. Similarly, if stone1 is at pos42, then pos42 cannot be clear.

However, I notice that these predicates are at the end of the state description, so they might be overriding the initial clear statements. So possibly, the grid looks like:

```
| 11 | 21 | 31 | 41 | 51 |
| 12G| 22P| 32 | 42S| 52 |
| 13 | 23 | 33 | 43 | 53 |
| 14 | 24 | 34 | 44 | 54 |
| 15 | 25 | 35 | 45 | 55 |
```

Wait, contradicting information is provided again. It states "Location pos22 is clear" and "Location pos42 is clear". These statements contradict "player1 is at pos22" and "stone1 is at location pos42". 

This could be a mistake in the problem statement or it could be that I'm misunderstanding something.

Let me re-read the actions and their preconditions again:

For the "move" action, the precondition is that the destination location is clear. This suggests that a location is clear if there's no agent or stone on it.

For the "push" action, the precondition is that the agent is at a location, a stone is at a different location, and the destination for the stone is clear.

Given these preconditions, it seems like the initial state might have some errors or the interpretation is different. Let's assume the correct interpretation based on the actions and their preconditions.

If a location has an agent or a stone, it is not clear. So, in the initial state, pos22 (where player1 is) and pos42 (where stone1 is) should not be labeled as clear.

Assuming the correct initial state, the grid would look like:

```
| 11 | 21 | 31 | 41 | 51 |
| 12G| 22P| 32 | 42S| 52 |
| 13 | 23 | 33 | 43 | 53 |
| 14 | 24 | 34 | 44 | 54 |
| 15 | 25 | 35 | 45 | 55 |
```

Now, our task is to move stone1 to a goal location, which is pos12. We need to determine a valid sequence of actions.

To move stone1 to pos12, we need to push it from pos42 to pos12, which implies a sequence of movements.

Let's plan the steps:

1. Move player1 from pos22 to pos32 (dirright).
2. Move player1 from pos32 to pos33 (dirdown).
3. Move player1 from pos33 to pos43 (dirright).
4. Move player1 from pos43 to pos42 (dirup).
5. Push stone1 from pos42 to pos32 (dirleft).
6. Push stone1 from pos32 to pos22 (dirleft).
7. Push stone1 from pos22 to pos12 (dirleft).

Let's check if these actions are valid:

Step 1: Move player1 from pos22 to pos32 (dirright)
- player1 is at pos22 (true)
- pos32 is clear (true)
- You can get from pos22 to pos32 following dirright (true, as per the rules).

Step 2: Move player1 from pos32 to pos33 (dirdown)
- After Step 1, player1 is at pos32
- pos33 is clear (true)
- You can get from pos32 to pos33 following dirdown (true, as per the rules).

Step 3: Move player1 from pos33 to pos43 (dirright)
- After Step 2, player1 is at pos33
- pos43 is clear (true)
- You can get from pos33 to pos43 following dirright (true, as per the rules).

Step 4: Move player1 from pos43 to pos42 (dirup)
- After Step 3, player1 is at pos43
- pos42 has stone1, so it's not clear. This step would be invalid.

Let's adjust:

4. Move player1 from pos43 to pos53 (dirright).
5. Move player1 from pos53 to pos52 (dirup).
6. Move player1 from pos52 to pos42 (dirleft).
7. Push stone1 from pos42 to pos32 (dirleft).
8. Push stone1 from pos32 to pos22 (dirleft).
9. Push stone1 from pos22 to pos12 (dirleft).

But wait, I'm confusing myself with the directions here. Let me just visualize the grid and make sure I understand the actions:

```
| 11 | 12G| 13 | 14 | 15 |
| 21 | 22P| 23 | 24 | 25 |
| 31 | 32 | 33 | 34 | 35 |
| 41 | 42S| 43 | 44 | 45 |
| 51 | 52 | 53 | 54 | 55 |
```

OK, so:
- dirright means moving from a smaller first digit to a larger first digit (moving right on the visualized grid).
- dirdown means moving from a smaller second digit to a larger second digit (moving down on the visualized grid).
- dirleft means moving from a larger first digit to a smaller first digit (moving left on the visualized grid).
- dirup means moving from a larger second digit to a smaller second digit (moving up on the visualized grid).

Given this, let's replan:

1. Move player1 from pos22 to pos32 (dirright).
2. Move player1 from pos32 to pos33 (dirdown).
3. Move player1 from pos33 to pos43 (dirright).
4. Move player1 from pos43 to pos42 (dirleft).
5. Push stone1 from pos42 to pos32 (dirleft).
6. Push stone1 from pos32 to pos22 (dirleft).
7. Push stone1 from pos22 to pos12 (dirleft).

Oh, I just realized that I'm thinking of dirright and dirdown differently from the problem description. Let me re-read:

"You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright"
"You may move from location pos11 to location pos12 following direction dirdown"

So, dirright means moving from a smaller first digit to a larger first digit (horizontally, to the right), and dirdown means moving from a smaller second digit to a larger second digit (vertically, downward). This matches my latest interpretation.

But further checking the initial state, it says "player1 is at pos22" and "stone1 is at pos42". It also says "Location pos22 is clear" and "Location pos42 is clear", which is contradictory. If there's an agent or a stone at a location, it should not be clear.

Let me correct this based on the problem description and our understanding of clarity:

```
"player1 is at location pos22"
"stone1 is at location pos42"
... [other clear locations] ...
```

Assuming those conflicting statements are errors, the grid should look like:

```
| 11 | 12G| 13 | 14 | 15 |
| 21 | 22P| 23 | 24 | 25 |
| 31 | 32 | 33 | 34 | 35 |
| 41 | 42S| 43 | 44 | 45 |
| 51 | 52 | 53 | 54 | 55 |
```

Now, let's replan based on the actions and their preconditions:

1. Move player1 from pos22 to pos23 (dirdown).
   preconditions: 
   - player1 is at pos22 (true)
   - pos23 is clear (true)
   - You can get from pos22 to pos23 following dirdown (true, as per the rules)

2. Move player1 from pos23 to pos33 (dirright).
   preconditions:
   - player1 is at pos23 (after step 1, true)
   - pos33 is clear (true)
   - You can get from pos23 to pos33 following dirright (true, as per the rules)

3. Move player1 from pos33 to pos43 (dirright).
   preconditions:
   - player1 is at pos33 (after step 2, true)
   - pos43 is clear (true)
   - You can get from pos33 to pos43 following dirright (true, as per the rules)

4. Move player1 from pos43 to pos42 (dirleft).
   preconditions:
   - player1 is at pos43 (after step 3, true)
   - pos42 is clear (false, stone1 is at pos42)

So step 4 is invalid. Let me adjust:

4. Move player1 from pos43 to pos33 (dirup).
   preconditions:
   - player1 is at pos43 (after step 3, true)
   - pos33 is clear (true, since player1 has moved)
   - You can get from pos43 to pos33 following dirup (true, as per the rules)

5. Move player1 from pos33 to pos32 (dirleft).
   preconditions:
   - player1 is at pos33 (after step 4, true)
   - pos32 is clear (true)
   - You can get from pos33 to pos32 following dirleft (true, as per the rules)

6. Move player1 from pos32 to pos31 (dirup).
   preconditions:
   - player1 is at pos32 (after step 5, true)
   - pos31 is clear (true)
   - You can get from pos32 to pos31 following dirup (true, as per the rules)

7. Move player1 from pos31 to pos41 (dirright).
   preconditions:
   - player1 is at pos31 (after step 6, true)
   - pos41 is clear (true)
   - You can get from pos31 to pos41 following dirright (true, as per the rules)

8. Move player1 from pos41 to pos42 (dirdown).
   preconditions:
   - player1 is at pos41 (after step 7, true)
   - pos42 is clear (false, stone1 is at pos42)

Wait, I was correct earlier, but I misunderstood the preconditions. 

For the "push" action, the precondition states: "You may only perform this action if (i) agent p is at location l_p, (ii) stone s is at location l_from, (iii) location l_to is clear, (iv) you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d, (v) you can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d."

So for the agent to push the stone, the agent needs to be in a location adjacent to the stone in the direction from which they want to push it. For instance, if the agent is at pos41 and the stone is at pos42, the agent can push it to pos43 following the direction dirdown.

Let's plan again:

1. Move player1 from pos22 to pos23 (dirdown).
2. Move player1 from pos23 to pos33 (dirright).
3. Move player1 from pos33 to pos43 (dirright).
4. Move player1 from pos43 to pos33 (dirup).
5. Move player1 from pos33 to pos32 (dirleft).
6. Move player1 from pos32 to pos31 (dirup).
7. Move player1 from pos31 to pos41 (dirright).
8. Push stone1 from pos42 to pos43 (dirdown).

Actually, wait, let's step back and think about this differently.

I need to get the stone from pos42 to pos12, which is a goal location. I need to use the push action.

Given the grid:
```
| 11 | 12G| 13 | 14 | 15 |
| 21 | 22P| 23 | 24 | 25 |
| 31 | 32 | 33 | 34 | 35 |
| 41 | 42S| 43 | 44 | 45 |
| 51 | 52 | 53 | 54 | 55 |
```

To get the stone from pos42 to pos12, I need to:
1. Push it from pos42 to pos32 (up).
2. Push it from pos32 to pos22 (up).
3. Push it from pos22 to pos12 (up).

For these actions, the player needs to be at the right positions.

For step 1, the player needs to be at pos52 to push the stone from pos42 to pos32. But pos52 is not directly linked to pos42 as per the rules. So we'd need an intermediate step to reach there. But wait, the player can be at pos41, pos43, or pos52 to push the stone from pos42 to pos32, as long as the direction of pushing is dirup.

Let's see which is more efficient:

If the player is at pos41, the pushing direction would be dirleft (since the player is to the left of the stone, and pushing from left to right would be dirright, the opposite is dirleft). But the player would be pushing to pos32, which is diagonally up and left from pos42, not in a straight line.

If the player is at pos43, the pushing direction would be dirright (since the player is to the right of the stone, and pushing from right to left would be dirleft, the opposite is dirright). But the player would be pushing to pos32, which is diagonally up and left from pos42, not in a straight line.

If the player is at pos52, the pushing direction would be dirdown (since the player is below the stone, and pushing from below to above would be dirup, the opposite is dirdown). But the player would be pushing to pos32, which is diagonally up and left from pos42, not in a straight line.

None of these seem right. Let's re-read the rule for pushing:

"pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": You may only perform this action if (i) agent p is at location l_p, (ii) stone s is at location l_from, (iii) location l_to is clear, (iv) you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d, (v) you can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d, and (vi) location l_to is a goal location.

So to push the stone from pos42 to pos32, I need a player position l_p such that:
- I can get from l_p to pos42 following direction d.
- I can get from pos42 to pos32 following the same direction d.
- Location pos32 is clear.

From the rules provided, I see:
"You may move from location pos42 to location pos32 following direction dirleft"

So, direction d for pushing from pos42 to pos32 is dirleft.

Now I need to find position l_p such that I can get from l_p to pos42 following the direction dirleft:
"You may move from location pos52 to location pos42 following direction dirleft"

So, the player should be at position pos52.

Let's redraw the grid to confirm:
```
| 11 | 12G| 13 | 14 | 15 |
| 21 | 22P| 23 | 24 | 25 |
| 31 | 32 | 33 | 34 | 35 |
| 41 | 42S| 43 | 44 | 45 |
| 51 | 52 | 53 | 54 | 55 |
```

Wait, this is still confusing. Let's revisit the directions.

"You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright"
"You may move from location pos11 to location pos12 following direction dirdown"

pos11 to pos21 is a movement to the right. (1,1) to (2,1).
pos11 to pos12 is a movement downward. (1,1) to (1,2).

Now, "You may move from location pos42 to location pos32 following direction dirleft"
This is a movement to the left. (4,2) to (3,2).

And, "You may move from location pos52 to location pos42 following direction dirleft"
This is a movement to the left. (5,2) to (4,2).

Using the same direction orientation, pos52 is not appropriate for pushing the stone from pos42 to pos32, as it's below pos42, not to the right of it.

Actually, directions are a bit unclear here. 

Let's reread the statement: "you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d"

This means you can move from l_p to l_from in direction d, not that d is the absolute direction in the grid.

So if the player is at pos43, they can move to pos42 following the direction dirleft, which means they move from right to left. And for the stone to be pushed, they would push from right to left as well, which would move the stone from pos42 to pos32.

Let's redo our planning:

1. Move player1 from pos22 to pos32 (dirright).
2. Move player1 from pos32 to pos33 (dirdown).
3. Move player1 from pos33 to pos43 (dirright).

At this point, player1 is at pos43 and stone1 is at pos42, which is directly to the left of the player. To push the stone to pos32, the direction of pushing would be dirleft.

4. PushToNonGoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos42 pos32 dirleft.

After this, player1 would be at pos42 and stone1 would be at pos32.

5. PushToNonGoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos22 dirleft.

After this, player1 would be at pos32 and stone1 would be at pos22.

6. PushToGoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos22 pos12 dirleft.

After this, player1 would be at pos22 and stone1 would be at pos12, which is a goal location.

Let's check if these steps are valid, considering the actions and their preconditions, as well as the current state of the world after each step:

Step 1: Move player1 from pos22 to pos32 (dirright)
Preconditions:
- player1 is at pos22 (true)
- pos32 is clear (true)
- You can get from pos22 to pos32 following dirright (true, as per the rules)

After this step:
- player1 is at pos32
- pos22 is clear
- pos32 is not clear

Step 2: Move player1 from pos32 to pos33 (dirdown)
Preconditions:
- player1 is at pos32 (true)
- pos33 is clear (true)
- You can get from pos32 to pos33 following dirdown (true, as per the rules)

After this step:
- player1 is at pos33
- pos32 is clear
- pos33 is not clear

Step 3: Move player1 from pos33 to pos43 (dirright)
Preconditions:
- player1 is at pos33 (true)
- pos43 is clear (true)
- You can get from pos33 to pos43 following dirright (true, as per the rules)

After this step:
- player1 is at pos43
- pos33 is clear
- pos43 is not clear

Step 4: PushToNonGoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos42 pos32 dirleft
Preconditions:
- player1 is at pos43 (true)
- stone1 is at pos42 (true)
- pos32 is clear (true)
- You can get from pos43 to pos42 following dirleft (true, as per the rules)
- You can get from pos42 to pos32 following dirleft (true, as per the rules)
- pos32 is not a goal location (true)

After this step:
- player1 is at pos42
- stone1 is at pos32
- pos43 is clear
- pos32 is not clear

Step 5: PushToNonGoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos22 dirleft
Preconditions:
- player1 is at pos42 (true)
- stone1 is at pos32 (true)
- pos22 is clear (true)
- You can get from pos42 to pos32 following dirleft (true, as per the rules)
- You can get from pos32 to pos22 following dirleft (true, as per the rules)
- pos22 is not a goal location (true)

After this step:
- player1 is at pos32
- stone1 is at pos22
- pos42 is clear
- pos22 is not clear

Step 6: PushToGoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos22 pos12 dirleft
Preconditions:
- player1 is at pos32 (true)
- stone1 is at pos22 (true)
- pos12 is clear (true)
- You can get from pos32 to pos22 following dirleft (true, as per the rules)
- You can get from pos22 to pos12 following dirleft (true, as per the rules)
- pos12 is a goal location (true)

After this step:
- player1 is at pos22
- stone1 is at pos12 (a goal location)
- pos32 is clear
- pos12 is not clear

This completes our task of moving stone1 to a goal location (pos12).

Actually, let's reconfirm one more time, especially about the directions.

"You may move from location pos43 to location pos42 following direction dirleft"
"You may move from location pos42 to location pos32 following direction dirleft"

This is a bit confusing. If direft means moving from a larger first digit to a smaller first digit (i.e., moving left on the visualized grid), then moving from (4,3) to (4,2) would be dirup, not dirleft. And moving from (4,2) to (3,2) would be dirleft.

Let's check other rules to confirm:
"You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright"
"You may move from location pos11 to location pos12 following direction dirdown"

pos11 to pos21 is a movement from (1,1) to (2,1), which is increasing the first digit, so dirright means moving rightward.
pos11 to pos12 is a movement from (1,1) to (1,2), which is increasing the second digit, so dirdown means moving downward.

So, dirleft means moving leftward, and dirup means moving upward.

Given this interpretation:
- Moving from pos43 to pos42 would be dirup, not dirleft. But I'm not sure if "You may move from location pos43 to location pos42 following direction dirleft" is a rule provided or if I made it up.

Let me check the rules again:
"You may move from location pos43 to location pos42 following direction dirup"

So my understanding is correct. 

OK let's replan, especially steps 3 and 4:

From the original grid:
```
| 11 | 12G| 13 | 14 | 15 |
| 21 | 22P| 23 | 24 | 25 |

```

1. Move player1 from pos22 to pos32 (dirright).
2. Move player1 from pos32 to pos33 (dirdown).
3. Move player1 from pos33 to pos43 (dirright).
4. Move player1 from pos43 to pos53 (dirright).
5. Move player1 from pos53 to pos52 (dirup).
6. Move player1 from pos52 to pos42 (dirleft).

Wait, the "pushtogoal" and "pushtonongoal" actions have a parameter l_p, which is the location of the player before the push, and l_from, which is the current location of the stone. This is quite intricate.

For example, in the "pushtogoal" action: "Make agent p, situated at location l_p, push stone s from location l_from to goal location l_to, following direction d".

Rereading the preconditions, one of them states: "you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d". This means the player should be able to move to the location of the stone in the specified direction. But it doesn't mean the player actually moves there; instead, the player pushes the stone in that direction.

To be clearer, let's consider the sequence again:

When the player is at pos52 (after step 5) and the stone is at pos42, the player can push the stone from pos42 to pos32 in the direction dirleft. This is because:
1. The player can move from pos52 to pos42 in the direction dirleft.
2. The stone can move from pos42 to pos32 in the direction dirleft.
3. pos32 is clear, and it's not a goal location (so we use pushtonongoal).

So, step 7 would be: PushToNonGoal player1 stone1 pos52 pos42 pos32 dirleft.

After this, the player would be at pos42 and the stone would be at pos32.

For step 8, the player is at pos42 and the stone is at pos32. The player can push the stone from pos32 to pos22 in the direction dirleft. This is because:
1. The player can move from pos42 to pos32 in the direction dirleft.
2. The stone can move from pos32 to pos22 in the direction dirleft.
3. pos22 is clear, and it's not a goal location (so we use pushtonongoal).

So, step 8 would be: PushToNonGoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos22 dirleft.

After this, the player would be at pos32 and the stone would be at pos22.

For step 9, the player is at pos32 and the stone is at pos22. The player can push the stone from pos22 to pos12 in the direction dirleft. This is because:
1. The player can move from pos32 to pos22 in the direction dirleft.
2. The stone can move from pos22 to pos12 in the direction dirleft.
3. pos12 is clear, and it's a goal location (so we use pushtogoal).

Actually, we've been focusing on the incorrect statement of the "push" precondition. After some thought, I think I was wrong in how to interpret (iv) and (v) in the preconditions:

"pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": You may only perform this action if ... (iv) you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d, (v) you can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d, ...

I initially thought that d was a constant direction like dirleft, dirright, etc. But looking at this statement, it suggests that d represents the direction from l_p to l_from (for condition iv) and the direction from l_from to l_to (for condition v).

So if l_p is pos52, l_from is pos42, and l_to is pos32, the direction d should be consistent for moving from l_p to l_from and from l_from to l_to. The consistent direction for moving from pos52 to pos42 and from pos42 to pos32 would be dirleft.

From the given rules, it is indeed possible to move from pos52 to pos42 following dirleft, and from pos42 to pos32 following dirleft as well.

So our plan should be:

1. Move player1 from pos22 to pos32 (dirright).
2. Move player1 from pos32 to pos33 (dirdown).
3. Move player1 from pos33 to pos43 (dirright).
4. Move player1 from pos43 to pos53 (dirright).
5. Move player1 from pos53 to pos52 (dirup).
6. PushToNonGoal player1 stone1 pos52 pos42 pos32 dirleft.
7. PushToNonGoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos22 dirleft.
8. PushToGoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos22 pos12 dirleft.

This should work, but let's quickly check the validity of each step to be sure.

Actually, I'm second-guessing myself now.

Let's rethink the formulation of the action and its preconditions.

For the action:
"pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d"
parameters are:
p = player
s = stone
l_p = initial location of player
l_from = initial location of stone
l_to = destination location for stone
d = direction

Preconditions include:
(iv) you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d
(v) you can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d

I think this is stating that the entire push action follows a straight line. The player at l_p pushes the stone at l_from to l_to. The direction d must be the same for both movements.

Let me think.

For the specific example, if player1 is at pos52 and stone1 is at pos42, and l_to is pos32, both the player and the stone move in the same direction (dirleft).

I first move from pos52 to pos42 following dirleft (from player's perspective). Then, maintaining the same direction dirleft, I push the stone from pos42 to pos32 (from the stone's perspective).

For the next step, the player is at pos42 (after pushing the stone to pos32). The stone is at pos32. I need to get the stone to pos22. Again, I'm pushing the stone in the direction dirleft. The player moves from pos42 to pos32 following dirleft, and the stone moves from pos32 to pos22 following the same direction.

For the final step, the player is at pos32 (after pushing the stone to pos22). The stone is at pos22. I need to get the stone to pos12, a goal location. Again, I'm pushing the stone in the direction dirleft. The player moves from pos32 to pos22 following dirleft, and the stone moves from pos22 to pos12 following the same direction.

I think our plan is correct. Let's summarize:

1. Move player1 from pos22 to pos32 (dirright).
2. Move player1 from pos32 to pos33 (dirdown).
3. Move player1 from pos33 to pos43 (dirright).
4. Move player1 from pos43 to pos53 (dirright).
5. Move player1 from pos53 to pos52 (dirup).
6. PushToNonGoal player1 stone1 pos52 pos42 pos32 dirleft.
7. PushToNonGoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos22 dirleft.
8. PushToGoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos22 pos12 dirleft.

Actually, I realized after step 7, when I push the stone from pos42 to pos32 in the direction dirleft and from pos32 to pos22 in the direction dirleft, I'm not sure if the correct plan for this kind of planning problem should use the same direction for all pushes.

Let's take a step back and consider what the original task is:

"The task is to bring about the following situation: stone1 is at a goal location."

So I need to ensure stone1 is at a goal location, which is specified as pos12.

Given the starting configuration: 
- player1 is at pos22
- stone1 is at pos42
- Goal is at pos12

The most direct route for stone1 to go to pos12 would be from pos42 to pos32 (moving to the left) and then from pos32 to pos22 (moving left again) and finally from pos22 to pos12 (moving left a third time).

So we need to ensure player1 is positioned properly to push stone1 along this route.

From the perspective of player1, the pushing steps are:
1. Push stone1 from pos42 to pos32. To do this, player1 must be at a position such that it can move to pos42 in the direction it wants to push stone1. To push stone1 leftward, player1 should be to the right of stone1, at pos52.
2. Push stone1 from pos32 to pos22. To do this, player1 must be at a position such that it can move to pos32 in the direction it wants to push stone1. To push stone1 leftward, player1 should be to the right of stone1, at pos42.
3. Push stone1 from pos22 to pos12. To do this, player1 must be at a position such that it can move to pos22 in the direction it wants to push stone1. To push stone1 leftward, player1 should be to the right of stone1, at pos32.

I was right before, just to reiterate, our plan is:

1. Move player1 from pos22 to pos32 (dirright).
2. Move player1 from pos32 to pos33 (dirdown).
3. Move player1 from pos33 to pos43 (dirright).
4. Move player1 from pos43 to pos53 (dirright).
5. Move player1 from pos53 to pos52 (dirup).
6. PushToNonGoal player1 stone1 pos52 pos42 pos32 dirleft.
7. PushToNonGoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos22 dirleft.
8. PushToGoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos22 pos12 dirleft.

I'm getting confused about the directions again. Let's look at the rules one more time:

"You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright"
"You may move from location pos11 to location pos12 following direction dirdown"

pos11 to pos21 is a rightward movement, and pos11 to pos12 is a downward movement. So dirright and dirdown make sense.

"You may move from location pos52 to location pos42 following direction dirleft"
"You may move from location pos42 to location pos32 following direction dirleft"

pos52 to pos42 is a leftward movement, and pos42 to pos32 is also a leftward movement. So dirleft makes sense for these movements. I am correctly interpreting the direction.

Now, let's double check this plan again. Player1 starts at pos22 and must move to pos52 in order to push the stone from pos42 to pos32. There are many valid paths to reach pos52, and I chose:

1. Move player1 from pos22 to pos32 (dirright).
2. Move player1 from pos32 to pos33 (dirdown).
3. Move player1 from pos33 to pos43 (dirright).
4. Move player1 from pos43 to pos53 (dirright).
5. Move player1 from pos53 to pos52 (dirup).

After this, player1 will be at pos52, and stone1 is still at pos42. Player1 can push the stone from pos42 to pos32 in the direction dirleft.

6. PushToNonGoal player1 stone1 pos52 pos42 pos32 dirleft.

After this push, player1 will be at pos42 and stone1 will be at pos32. Player1 can push the stone from pos32 to pos22 in the direction dirleft.

7. PushToNonGoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos22 dirleft.

After this push, player1 will be at pos32 and stone1 will be at pos22. Player1 can push the stone from pos22 to pos12 in the direction dirleft.

8. PushToGoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos22 pos12 dirleft.

After this push, player1 will be at pos22 and stone1 will be at pos12, which is a goal location, completing the task.

Actually, let me double check that there isn't a more optimal plan, e.g., a shorter one.

One additional move I could omit is the move to pos33 and then back to pos32. Instead, I might simply move from pos32 to pos42, then to pos52, without going the roundabout way through pos33, pos43, and pos53.

Let's try:

1. Move player1 from pos22 to pos32 (dirright).
2. Move player1 from pos32 to pos42 (dirright).
3. Move player1 from pos42 to pos52 (dirright).

Actually wait, pos42 has stone1. So I can't move there directly. I need to go around it:

1. Move player1 from pos22 to pos23 (dirdown).
2. Move player1 from pos23 to pos24 (dirdown).
3. Move player1 from pos24 to pos34 (dirright).
4. Move player1 from pos34 to pos44 (dirright).
5. Move player1 from pos44 to pos43 (dirleft).
6. Move player1 from pos43 to pos53 (dirright).
7. Move player1 from pos53 to pos52 (dirleft).
8. PushToNonGoal player1 stone1 pos52 pos42 pos32 dirleft.
9. PushToNonGoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos22 dirleft.
10. PushToGoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos22 pos12 dirleft.

actually, it's shorter for me to go the right way from pos22, not the down way:

1. Move player1 from pos22 to pos32 (dirright).
2. Move player1 from pos32 to pos33 (dirdown).
3. Move player1 from pos33 to pos43 (dirright).
4. Move player1 from pos43 to pos53 (dirright).
5. Move player1 from pos53 to pos52 (dirup).
6. PushToNonGoal player1 stone1 pos52 pos42 pos32 dirleft.
7. PushToNonGoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos22 dirleft.
8. PushToGoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos22 pos12 dirleft.

Actually I wonder if there's an easier way. Let me check:

Player1 is at pos22 and stone1 is at pos42. The goal is at pos12.

Wait, I might be stuck with this solution.

I need to get player1 behind stone1 to push it in the direction I want. Since stone1 is currently at pos42, I need player1 to be behind stone1 in the horizontal direction (at pos52) to push it left. There doesn't seem to be a more direct way than my current plan:

1. Move player1 from pos22 to pos32 (dirright).
2. Move player1 from pos32 to pos33 (dirdown).
3. Move player1 from pos33 to pos43 (dirright).
4. Move player1 from pos43 to pos53 (dirright).
5. Move player1 from pos53 to pos52 (dirup).
6. PushToNonGoal player1 stone1 pos52 pos42 pos32 dirleft.
7. PushToNonGoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos22 dirleft.
8. PushToGoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos22 pos12 dirleft.

Alright, I believe this is the optimal plan.

Actually let's double check:

**Position 1:** player1 at pos22, stone1 at pos42

**Position 2 (after move 1):** player1 at pos32, stone1 at pos42

**Position 3 (after move 2):** player1 at pos33, stone1 at pos42

**Position 4 (after move 3):** player1 at pos43, stone1 at pos42

**Position 5 (after move 4):** player1 at pos53, stone1 at pos42

**Position 6 (after move 5):** player1 at pos52, stone1 at pos42. 
At this point, player1 can push stone1 from pos42 to pos32 by moving in the direction dirleft.

**Position 7 (after push 6):** player1 at pos42, stone1 at pos32.
At this point, player1 can push stone1 from pos32 to pos22 by moving in the direction dirleft.

**Position 8 (after push 7):** player1 at pos32, stone1 at pos22.
At this point, player1 can push stone1 from pos22 to pos12 by moving in the direction dirleft.

**Position 9 (after push 8):** player1 at pos22, stone1 at pos12.
At this point, stone1 is at a goal location, completing the task.

So our final plan is:
1. Move player1 from pos22 to pos32 (dirright).
2. Move player1 from pos32 to pos33 (dirdown).
3. Move player1 from pos33 to pos43 (dirright).
4. Move player1 from pos43 to pos53 (dirright).
5. Move player1 from pos53 to pos52 (dirup).
6. PushToNonGoal player1 stone1 pos52 pos42 pos32 dirleft.
7. PushToNonGoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos22 dirleft.
8. PushToGoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos22 pos12 dirleft.

Actually, looking at move 5, I said dirup, but this would be from pos53 to pos52. Let's be precise on the directions.

From the given directions:
"You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright"
"You may move from location pos11 to location pos12 following direction dirdown"

So, dirright means increasing the first digit, and dirdown means increasing the second digit. Conversely, dirleft would mean decreasing the first digit, and dirup would mean decreasing the second digit.

Now, going from pos53 to pos52 would be dirup (decreasing the second digit from 3 to 2).

So the accurate directions for our steps are:

1. Move player1 from pos22 to pos32 (dirright).
2. Move player1 from pos32 to pos33 (dirdown).
3. Move player1 from pos33 to pos43 (dirright).
4. Move player1 from pos43 to pos53 (dirright).
5. Move player1 from pos53 to pos52 (dirup).
6. PushToNonGoal player1 stone1 pos52 pos42 pos32 dirleft.
7. PushToNonGoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos22 dirleft.
8. PushToGoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos22 pos12 dirleft.

This plan accurately reflects the directions in the given grid.
