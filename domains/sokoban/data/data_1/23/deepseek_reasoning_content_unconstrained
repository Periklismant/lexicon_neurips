Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. The goal is to get stone1 to a goal location, which in this case is pos15. The initial state has the agent at pos11 and stone1 at pos32. All other locations are clear except where mentioned.

First, I need to figure out the path the agent can take to reach the stone. The agent is at pos11. Looking at the movement options, from pos11, the agent can go right to pos21 or down to pos12. But since the stone is at pos32, which is further right and down, the agent needs to move towards that direction.

Let me map out the path from pos11 to pos32. Starting at pos11, possible moves are right to pos21 or down to pos12. Let's try moving right first. From pos21, the agent can go right to pos31 or down to pos22. If we go right to pos31, then from there, down to pos32. That seems possible. So the path would be pos11 -> pos21 (right), then pos21 -> pos31 (right), then pos31 -> pos32 (down). That gets the agent next to the stone at pos32.

Wait, the stone is at pos32. So the agent needs to be adjacent to push it. To push the stone towards a goal location, which is pos15. But pos15 is in the top-right corner. How can we get the stone there?

Wait, the goal location is pos15. So stone1 needs to be moved to pos15. The stone is currently at pos32. So the agent needs to push it from pos32 all the way to pos15. But how?

The agent must push the stone step by step. Let's think about the path. From pos32, possible directions to push. The agent has to be in a position adjacent to the stone to push it. Let's see:

To push the stone from pos32 to pos33 (right?), but pos33 is a non-goal. But the final goal requires the stone to be at a goal location, which is pos15. So the stone needs to be moved from pos32 up and left? Wait, pos15 is the top-right (row 1, column 5). So the stone is at row 3, column 2. To get to pos15, which is row 1, column5. That's quite a journey.

Wait, let's visualize the grid:

Rows are 1 to 5, columns 1 to 5. So pos11 is row1, column1; pos15 is row1, column5. The stone is at pos32 (row3, column2). The goal is to get it to pos15.

So the stone needs to move from (3,2) to (1,5). The agent needs to push it through the grid. Let's plan the path.

Possible path for the stone: pos32 â†’ pos22 (up, column2, row2), then pos12 (up again), then pos13 (right), pos14, pos15. But wait, pushing up from pos32 to pos22 would require the agent to be at pos32's direction. Wait, to push a stone, the agent must be adjacent in the direction they are pushing. For example, to push the stone from pos32 to pos22 (up direction), the agent must be at pos32's south, i.e., pos42? Wait no. Wait, direction matters. Let's check the movement directions.

The direction "dirup" would mean moving up in rows (from higher row to lower row, since pos11 is row1, so row numbers increase going down). So moving up from pos32 (row3) would go to pos22 (row2). So to push the stone from pos32 to pos22, the agent must be at pos32's direction towards up. Wait, the action "pushtogoal" or "pushtonongoal" requires that the agent is at l_p, which is adjacent in direction d to l_from (where the stone is). So, for example, to push the stone from pos32 upwards (dirup) to pos22, the agent must be at l_p, which is pos32's next in direction d. Wait, the preconditions for pushtogoal: agent is at l_p, stone is at l_from. The direction d must allow moving from l_p to l_from (so l_p is adjacent to l_from in direction d). Then, from l_from to l_to in direction d. So for the agent to push the stone from l_from to l_to in direction d, the agent must be at a location l_p that is adjacent to l_from in the opposite direction. Wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, the preconditions for pushtogoal are:

(i) agent p is at l_p.

(ii) stone s is at l_from.

(iii) l_to is clear.

(iv) can get from l_p to l_from following direction d. So l_p and l_from are connected via direction d. For example, if the direction is dirup, then l_p is south of l_from. Because moving from l_p to l_from in direction d (dirup) means l_from is north of l_p. So to push a stone north (dirup), the agent must be south of the stone.

So to push the stone from l_from (pos32) to l_to (pos22) direction dirup, the agent must be at l_p which is south of pos32. Wait, but pos32's south is pos42. So the agent needs to be at pos42, but in the initial state, pos42 is clear, but the agent is at pos11. So how to get there?

Alternatively, maybe the agent can approach from the west or east. Let's see.

The stone is at pos32. Possible directions to push:

- dirup: to pos22. Agent needs to be south (pos42) of pos32. But agent is at pos11. To reach pos42, that's a long way.

- dirleft: from pos32 to pos31. Agent needs to be east (pos33) of pos32 to push west. But pos33 is clear. But initially, the agent is at pos11. So moving to pos33 would require a path.

Alternatively, pushing the stone down (dirdown) to pos42. But pos42 is a non-goal. Then from pos42, perhaps push right to pos52, then up, etc. But that might not lead towards pos15.

Wait, but the goal is to get the stone to pos15, which is a goal location. So the optimal path would be to push the stone directly towards pos15 as efficiently as possible.

Let me consider the possible path for the stone:

From pos32 (3,2) to pos22 (2,2), then pos12 (1,2), then pos13 (1,3), pos14 (1,4), pos15 (1,5). But each of these steps requires the agent to be in the correct position to push.

But how can the agent get behind the stone to push it upwards? For example, to push from pos32 to pos22 (dirup), the agent must be at pos32's south (pos42), which is not adjacent. Wait, no. The agent needs to be adjacent in the direction opposite to the push direction. Because to push the stone north (dirup), the agent must be south of the stone. So the agent needs to be at pos42 (row4, column2), which is directly south of pos32. But the agent starts at pos11. How to get to pos42?

Alternatively, maybe there's another path. Let's think about moving the agent around the grid to get into position to push the stone.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Move agent from pos11 to pos32's adjacent position so that they can push the stone towards the goal.

But the stone is at pos32. The agent needs to reach a position adjacent to pos32. Let's check the possible adjacent positions.

Adjacent to pos32:

- pos22 (up)
- pos31 (left)
- pos33 (right)
- pos42 (down)

The agent needs to reach one of these to push the stone in a direction that moves it towards pos15.

The quickest way to get the agent near pos32 would be to move right and down. Let's see:

Starting at pos11, possible moves:

Option 1: Move right to pos21 (dirright), then right again to pos31 (dirright), then down to pos32 (dirdown). But wait, the movement from pos31 to pos32 is allowed? Let me check the movement rules.

Looking at the initial state's movement possibilities: "You may move from location pos31 to location pos32 following direction dirdown". Yes. So the agent can move from pos31 to pos32.

But pos32 is currently occupied by the stone. Wait, no: in the initial state, "stone1 is at location pos32" and "Location pos32 is clear". Wait, no. The initial state says "Location pos32 is clear", but stone1 is at pos32. Wait, that's a contradiction. Wait, the original state says "stone1 is at location pos32" and "Location pos32 is clear". That can't be right. Because if a stone is at a location, that location is not clear. But according to the problem description, each position may contain either the agent, a stone, or be empty. So if a stone is present, the location is not clear. But in the initial state, the user says "stone1 is at location pos32" and "Location pos32 is clear". That's conflicting. Wait, but perhaps "clear" refers to being free of the agent and stones. Or maybe it's a mistake in the problem description.

Wait, let me check the original state again:

Original state:

"player1 is at location pos11"

"stone1 is at location pos32"

"Location pos12 is clear"

...

"Location pos32 is clear"

But that's impossible. If the stone is at pos32, then pos32 is not clear. So this must be an error in the problem statement. But assuming that the user provided the correct initial state, perhaps "clear" refers to the agent not being there. Maybe the presence of a stone does not affect the "clear" status. Wait, but the actions have preconditions like "location l_to is clear", which would mean that neither the agent nor a stone is there. Because when you push a stone to l_to, you need l_to to be clear. So in the initial state, pos32 has the stone, so it's not clear, but the problem says "Location pos32 is clear". That's a contradiction. But maybe the user made a mistake. Alternatively, maybe "clear" means only that the agent is not there. But that's unlikely. Hmm. This is confusing.

But given that the problem states "Location pos32 is clear" while stone1 is there, perhaps there's a misunderstanding. But since the problem says "The original state of the world is the following", and lists both "stone1 is at location pos32" and "Location pos32 is clear", this must be an error. However, I need to proceed with the given information as per the problem.

Assuming that in the initial state, pos32 is occupied by the stone, so it's not clear. But according to the problem's initial state, "Location pos32 is clear" which contradicts that. This is a problem. But perhaps it's a typo, and the stone is at pos33? Or perhaps the user intended that "clear" refers to something else. Alternatively, maybe the stone's presence doesn't affect the "clear" status, which would be odd. This is a critical point because if pos32 is clear, the agent can move there, but the stone is there. But the presence of the stone would block the agent's movement.

This is a significant issue. Without resolving this, the plan can't be made correctly. Let me recheck the problem's original state.

Looking back:

Original state:

"player1 is at location pos11"

"stone1 is at location pos32"

"Location pos12 is clear"

... (many locations listed as clear)

"Location pos32 is clear"

So according to this, pos32 is clear despite having the stone. That's a contradiction. This must be an error in the problem statement. However, perhaps "clear" in this context refers to the agent not being present, while stones are allowed. That would make sense. So a location is clear if the agent is not there, regardless of stones. Because when moving the agent, the preconditions require the destination to be clear (i.e., agent is not there, but stones can be present). But that's not standard, but given the problem's statements, maybe that's the case.

Alternatively, perhaps "clear" means that neither the agent nor a stone is present. In that case, the initial state is invalid because pos32 has a stone but is listed as clear. So this is a problem. Given that, maybe the user made a mistake, but I have to proceed with the given information. Let's assume that the initial state is correctly specified, even if there's a contradiction. So pos32 has the stone and is clear. Then, when the agent moves, they can move into pos32 even if the stone is there. But that's not possible, as per the problem's description, which says each position may contain the agent, a stone, or be empty. So a position can't have both agent and stone. Thus, the initial state must be incorrect. But since the problem states that pos32 is clear and stone1 is there, this is conflicting. Therefore, perhaps the user intended that pos32 is not clear, and the line "Location pos32 is clear" is a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the stone is at pos33. But given that the problem states stone1 is at pos32, I have to proceed with that.

Given this confusion, perhaps I should proceed under the assumption that "clear" refers to the absence of both agent and stones. Therefore, the initial state is invalid. But since the problem says that pos32 is clear and has the stone, I must treat this as a mistake and proceed. Therefore, perhaps the stone is at pos32, and pos32 is not clear, but the problem's initial state erroneously lists it as clear. But how can I proceed?

Alternatively, maybe "clear" refers to the agent not being present. So a location is clear if the agent is not there, regardless of stones. So in that case, pos32 is clear (no agent) even with the stone. Then, the agent can move to pos32 only if it's clear (i.e., no agent there), which it is. But moving into pos32 would require that the location is clear (agent not there), which it is, but then after moving, the agent would be in the same location as the stone, which is not allowed. Because the problem states each position may contain either the agent, a stone, or be empty. So positions can't have both. Therefore, the initial state is invalid. This is a problem.

But given that the user provided this initial state, perhaps I have to proceed with the assumption that the stone's presence doesn't affect the "clear" status. So a location is clear if the agent is not there, even if there's a stone. Therefore, in the initial state, pos32 is clear (agent not there) despite having the stone. Then, when the agent moves to pos32, it's allowed, but after moving, the agent and stone would be in the same location, which is impossible. Therefore, this is a problem.

Alternatively, perhaps "clear" means the location has neither the agent nor a stone. Then, the initial state is invalid. But since the problem states that pos32 is clear and has the stone, this is impossible. Therefore, this suggests a possible error in the problem statement. But given that, perhaps the user intended that the stone is at pos32, and pos32 is not clear, but the initial state lists it as clear. Therefore, there's a mistake. But since I have to work with the given information, I'll proceed under the assumption that "clear" refers to the agent's absence, not considering stones. Therefore, pos32 is clear (no agent), but the stone is there. Then, the agent can move into pos32, but that's impossible because the stone is there. Therefore, the agent cannot move into pos32. So the initial state's description is conflicting, but I'll have to proceed.

Given this confusion, perhaps the best approach is to proceed with the initial state as described, even if there's a contradiction. Therefore, the stone is at pos32, and pos32 is clear (agent not there). So the agent can move to pos32 if needed. But moving there would require that pos32 is clear, which it is, but after moving, the agent and stone would be in the same location, which is not allowed. Therefore, this is impossible. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the problem's initial state. But since I have to provide a plan, perhaps the correct initial state is that pos32 is not clear (because the stone is there), and the line "Location pos32 is clear" is a mistake. In that case, pos32 is not clear, so the agent cannot move there. Therefore, the agent must navigate around.

Assuming that pos32 is occupied by the stone (thus not clear), the agent can't move into pos32. So the agent needs to approach pos32 from an adjacent tile.

So the stone is at pos32. The agent needs to get to a position adjacent to pos32 to push it. Let's see:

Possible adjacent positions to pos32 are pos22 (up), pos31 (left), pos33 (right), pos42 (down).

The agent starts at pos11. How to get to one of these positions.

Possible path for the agent to reach pos22 (which is adjacent to pos32's north):

From pos11, move right to pos21 (dirright), then down to pos22 (dirdown). Then from pos22, move right to pos32 (dirright) would be the stone's current position, which is blocked. So agent can't go there. But to push the stone from pos32 to pos22 (up), the agent needs to be south of pos32 (pos42). So agent needs to get to pos42.

Alternative path to pos42: from pos11, move down to pos12 (dirdown), then right to pos22 (dirright), then down to pos23 (if possible), then right to pos33, then down to pos43, then left to pos42? That seems complicated.

Alternatively, pos11 â†’ pos21 (right), pos21 â†’ pos31 (right), pos31 â†’ pos32 (down). But pos32 has the stone, so agent can't move there. So instead, from pos31, move down to pos32 is impossible because it's occupied by the stone. Therefore, agent can move from pos31 to pos41 (dirright), then down to pos42 (dirdown). So pos31 â†’ pos41 (dirright), then pos41 â†’ pos42 (dirdown). Then the agent is at pos42, which is south of pos32. From there, the agent can push the stone north (dirup) to pos22.

Wait, but pos22 is a non-goal location. However, the goal is to get the stone to pos15, which is a goal. So pushing the stone up to pos22 is a step towards the goal. Then, from pos22, the agent can push it up to pos12, then to pos13, pos14, pos15.

But each push requires the agent to be in the correct position.

Let's outline the steps:

1. Move agent from pos11 to pos42.

How to get there:

Possible path:

pos11 â†’ pos12 (dirdown)

pos12 â†’ pos22 (dirright)

pos22 â†’ pos32 (dirright) [blocked by stone]

Alternatively, pos22 â†’ pos23 (dirdown)

pos23 â†’ pos33 (dirright)

pos33 â†’ pos43 (dirright)

pos43 â†’ pos42 (dirleft) ?

Wait, no. Let's check the movement directions.

From pos43, can the agent move left to pos42? Looking at the movement possibilities:

Looking at the initial movement options, from pos43, you can move left to pos33 (dirleft), or right to pos53 (dirright), up to pos42 (dirup), or down to pos44 (dirdown). Wait, according to the problem's movement list:

"You may move from location pos43 to location pos33 following direction dirleft"

"You may move from location pos43 to location pos53 following direction dirright"

"You may move from location pos43 to location pos42 following direction dirup"

"You may move from location pos43 to location pos44 following direction dirdown"

So yes, from pos43, moving up (dirup) to pos42. So path could be:

pos11 â†’ pos12 (dirdown)

pos12 â†’ pos22 (dirright)

pos22 â†’ pos23 (dirdown)

pos23 â†’ pos33 (dirright)

pos33 â†’ pos43 (dirright)

pos43 â†’ pos42 (dirup)

Now the agent is at pos42. From here, they can push the stone at pos32 north (dirup) to pos22.

So action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos22 dirup.

Wait, but pos22 is a non-goal location. But the stone needs to be pushed towards the goal. So after pushing to pos22, the next step would be to push it up to pos12, then right to pos13, pos14, pos15.

But let's verify if this is possible.

After pushing the stone to pos22, the agent will be at pos32 (since after pushing, the agent moves from l_p (pos42) to l_from (pos32), then the stone moves to l_to (pos22). So the agent is now at pos32, which is clear (since the stone moved to pos22). Wait, no: the effect of pushtonongoal is:

After performing this action:

(i) agent p is no longer at l_p (pos42).

(ii) stone s is no longer at l_from (pos32).

(iii) l_to (pos22) is no longer clear.

(iv) agent p is at l_from (pos32).

(v) stone s is at l_to (pos22).

(vi) l_p (pos42) is clear.

So after pushing, the agent is at pos32, and the stone is at pos22. But pos32 is now clear (since the agent is there?), but according to the problem's initial state, pos32 was clear with the stone there. This is getting too confusing. Maybe I need to model the state transitions carefully.

Assuming that after pushing, the agent is at pos32, and the stone is at pos22. Then, the agent needs to move around to push the stone further.

But pos22 is now occupied by the stone. To push it north to pos12, the agent needs to be south of pos22 (pos32) and then push north. So agent is at pos32, which is where they are after the first push. From pos32, the agent can push the stone at pos22 north to pos12.

Wait, the stone is at pos22. To push it north to pos12, the agent needs to be south of pos22, which is pos32. So the agent is already at pos32. So the next action would be pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos22 pos12 dirup.

But wait, pos12 is a non-goal location. So the action would be pushtonongoal. Then, after this, the agent is at pos22, and the stone is at pos12.

Then, the agent can push the stone from pos12 to pos13 (dirdown? No, pos13 is down from pos12. Wait, pos12's movement options:

From pos12, you can move right to pos22, up to pos11, or down to pos13.

Wait, direction dirdown from pos12 is to pos13. So to push the stone east (dirright) from pos12 to pos13, no, because dirright would be east. Wait, the directions are dirdown, dirup, dirleft, dirright. So pushing the stone east (dirright) from pos12 would go to pos13 (assuming east is column+1). Wait, pos12 is row1, column2. East (dirright) would be column3, so pos13. So to push the stone from pos12 to pos13 (dirright), the agent needs to be west of pos12, which is pos11. So the agent would need to be at pos11 to push east to pos12's dirright (pos13). But after the previous step, the agent is at pos22.

Wait, after pushing the stone from pos22 to pos12, the agent is at pos22. Then, to push the stone from pos12 to pos13, the agent needs to be west of pos12 (pos11) or south of pos12 (pos22), etc. Let's see:

To push the stone from pos12 to pos13 (dirright), the agent must be at a location l_p such that moving from l_p to pos12 in direction dirright. Wait, the direction for the push is dirright. So the agent needs to be west of pos12 (pos11) because moving from l_p to pos12 in dirright direction. So the agent must be at pos11, then can push the stone east to pos13.

But after the previous step (agent at pos22), how to get to pos11? That's a long way. Alternatively, perhaps the agent can push the stone up from pos12 to pos11, but pos11 is a non-goal and that's not helpful. Alternatively, find a different path.

Alternatively, after the stone is at pos12, the agent is at pos22. To push the stone east to pos13, the agent needs to be west of pos12 (pos11). But the agent is at pos22. So the agent would need to move from pos22 to pos11.

How?

pos22 â†’ pos12 (dirup), then pos12 â†’ pos11 (dirup). But pos12 is occupied by the stone. Wait, no: after pushing the stone to pos12, the stone is at pos12, so the agent can't move into pos12. So the agent is at pos22. To get to pos11, the agent needs to move up from pos22 to pos12, but pos12 has the stone. So that's blocked. Therefore, the agent can't go that way. Alternative path from pos22 to pos11: pos22 â†’ pos21 (dirup), then pos21 â†’ pos11 (dirleft). Yes.

So after pushing the stone to pos12, the agent is at pos22. Then:

Action: move player1 pos22 pos21 dirup. (preconditions: pos21 must be clear. Initially, pos21 is clear. After pushing the stone to pos12, pos21 remains clear. So this move is possible.

Then, move player1 pos21 pos11 dirleft. Now the agent is at pos11.

Then, the agent can push the stone from pos12 to pos13 (dirright). So action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos11 pos12 pos13 dirright. But wait, pos11 is the agent's location. To push from pos12 to pos13 (dirright), the agent must be at pos12's west (pos11), and move east to pos12. So yes, the agent is at pos11. So the preconditions:

(i) agent is at pos11.

(ii) stone is at pos12.

(iii) pos13 is clear.

(iv) can move from pos11 to pos12 following dirright? According to the movement possibilities, from pos11, you can move right (dirright) to pos21, and down (dirdown) to pos12. So moving from pos11 to pos12 is via dirdown. So the direction from pos11 to pos12 is dirdown, not dirright. Therefore, the agent cannot move from pos11 to pos12 via dirright. So the direction for pushing from pos12 to pos13 would require the agent to be at pos11, moving down to pos12 (dirdown), then pushing east (dirright) to pos13. But the direction for the push is dirright, so the agent's path from l_p to l_from (pos12) must be in direction d (dirright). But pos11 to pos12 is dirdown, not dirright. Therefore, the agent can't perform the push from pos11 to pos12 with direction dirright. Instead, the agent needs to be west of pos12 (pos11) and move east to pos12, but according to the movement options, that's not possible. Because from pos11, moving east (dirright) goes to pos21, not pos12. To move from pos11 to pos12, the direction is dirdown.

Therefore, the agent can't use dirright to get from pos11 to pos12. So the agent is at pos11, and can't push the stone from pos12 to pos13 via dirright. Instead, the agent would need to be at pos12's south to push north, but pos12's south is pos22. Wait, no: direction up/down is rows. So to push north (dirup) from pos12 to pos11, the agent must be south of pos12 (pos22). But pos11 is north. So to push the stone east (dirright) from pos12 to pos13, the agent must be west of pos12 (pos11), but the movement from pos11 to pos12 is dirdown, not dirright. Therefore, the agent can't satisfy the precondition (iv) of being able to move from l_p to l_from following direction d. Because for the push from pos12 to pos13 dirright, the agent must be able to move from l_p to pos12 via direction dirright, but pos11 to pos12 is not via dirright. Therefore, the agent can't push the stone from pos12 to pos13 in this way.

Hmm, this complicates things. So the agent needs to find another way to push the stone east from pos12 to pos13. Perhaps by approaching from the south.

If the agent is at pos22 (south of pos12), then can push the stone north (dirup) to pos12, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, the agent can push the stone east from pos12 to pos13 by being south of pos12 (pos22) and pushing east. Wait, but pos12 is at row1, column2. East would be column3, so pos13. To push east from pos12, the direction is dirright. So the agent must be west of pos12 (pos11), but movement from pos11 to pos12 is dirdown, not dirright. So the direction doesn't match. Therefore, this approach won't work.

Alternative plan: after pushing the stone to pos22, then push it east to pos23, then up to pos13, etc. But let's see:

After the stone is at pos22, the agent is at pos32. From pos32, the agent can move to pos31 (dirleft), then pos21 (dirleft), pos11 (dirleft), but that's not helpful. Or from pos32, the agent can move down to pos42 (dirdown), then west to pos41, etc. Not sure.

Alternatively, after pushing the stone to pos22, the agent is at pos32. Then, the agent can move to pos33 (dirright), then pos43 (dirright), pos44 (dirdown), etc. Not helpful.

Alternatively, the agent could move from pos32 to pos31 (dirleft), then pos21 (dirleft), pos11 (dirleft), and then push the stone from pos22 to pos23 (dirdown). But how?

Wait, the stone is at pos22. To push it down (dirdown) to pos23, the agent must be north of pos22 (pos12). So the agent needs to be at pos12, but pos12 has the stone. No, after the first push, the stone is at pos22, so pos12 is clear.

Wait, after the first push:

- Agent is at pos32.

- Stone is at pos22.

- pos42 is clear (from the pushtonongoal effect).

The agent can move from pos32 to pos22 (dirup), but pos22 is occupied by the stone. So no.

Alternatively, agent can move from pos32 to pos31 (dirleft), then to pos21 (dirleft), pos11 (dirleft). Then, the agent is back at pos11. From there, can they push the stone from pos22 to pos23?

To push the stone from pos22 to pos23 (dirdown), the agent must be north of pos22 (pos12). So agent needs to be at pos12, then push south. But pos12 is currently clear.

So agent can move from pos11 to pos12 (dirdown). Then, push the stone from pos22 to pos23 (dirdown). But wait, the stone is at pos22. The agent is at pos12, which is north of pos22. So to push south (dirdown) from pos22 to pos23, the agent must be at pos22's north (pos12), move south to pos22 (precondition iv: can get from l_p (pos12) to l_from (pos22) following direction d (dirdown). Yes. Then, from pos22 to pos23 (dirdown) is allowed. So the action would be pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos12 pos22 pos23 dirdown.

After this, the stone is at pos23, and the agent is at pos22.

Then, the agent can push the stone from pos23 to pos24 (dirdown), then pos25, then pos35, etc. But this leads the stone away from the goal. Not helpful.

Alternatively, after pushing the stone to pos22, the agent could move to pos32 and then push the stone east to pos23, but that's not towards the goal.

This approach seems to be leading the stone away. So perhaps the initial plan to push the stone north to pos22 is not optimal. Let's consider a different path.

Alternative idea: move the agent to the east side and push the stone east to pos33, then pos34, pos35, pos45, etc., but pos15 is in the opposite direction. Not helpful.

Alternatively, push the stone west to pos31, then up to pos21, then pos11, then east again. But that's backtracking.

Alternatively, find a path that moves the stone to pos15 via the rightmost columns.

Wait, pos15 is the goal. The stone needs to get there. The agent needs to push it along the top row (row1) from pos12 to pos15. But how to get the stone into row1.

Alternative plan:

Push the stone from pos32 to pos33 (dirright). Agent is at pos42. Then, push to pos34, pos35, pos45, pos55... Not helpful.

Alternatively, push the stone up to pos22, then right to pos23, pos24, pos25, pos35, pos45, pos44, etc. This is not leading towards pos15.

This is getting complicated. Let's think of the shortest possible path.

The stone needs to go from pos32 to pos15. The minimal number of moves would require moving up two rows (from row3 to row1) and right three columns (from column2 to column5). So total of 5 moves (up, up, right, right, right). But each push requires the agent to be in the correct position.

Alternatively, the agent could push the stone up twice, then right three times.

Let's try:

1. Push stone from pos32 to pos22 (dirup). Agent is at pos42.

2. Push stone from pos22 to pos12 (dirup). Agent is at pos22.

3. Push stone from pos12 to pos13 (dirright). Agent is at pos11.

Wait, but as discussed earlier, this third step may not be possible due to direction issues.

Alternatively, after step 2, the stone is at pos12. The agent is at pos22. Then, the agent can move to pos12 (but pos12 has the stone, so no). So agent needs to move around.

From pos22, agent can move to pos21 (dirup), then pos11 (dirleft). Then, from pos11, push the stone east to pos13 (dirright), but the agent needs to be at pos12's west (pos11) and move east to pos12. But movement from pos11 to pos12 is dirdown, not dirright. Therefore, the push isn't possible.

This is a dead end.

Alternative approach: After pushing the stone to pos22, the agent is at pos32. Then, the agent can move to pos31 (dirleft), then pos21 (dirleft), pos11 (dirleft). Then, from pos11, move down to pos12 (dirdown). Now the agent is at pos12. From here, can the agent push the stone east to pos13?

The stone is at pos22. The agent is at pos12. To push the stone from pos22 to pos23 (dirdown), the agent needs to be north of pos22 (pos12) and push south. So yes. So action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos12 pos22 pos23 dirdown. Then the stone is at pos23. The agent is at pos22. Then, the agent can push the stone east to pos24, etc., but this leads away from the goal.

Alternatively, after the stone is at pos22, the agent can move to pos32, then pos31, pos21, pos11, pos12. Then, push the stone north to pos12 from pos22. Wait, no. The stone is at pos22. To push north to pos12, the agent must be south of pos22 (pos32), which the agent can reach by moving from pos12 to pos22 (dirright), but pos22 has the stone. So agent can't move there.

This is getting too time-consuming. Let me try to outline a possible valid plan, even if it's suboptimal, then see if it can be optimized.

Plan steps:

1. Move agent from pos11 to pos42:

   - pos11 â†’ pos12 (dirdown)

   - pos12 â†’ pos22 (dirright)

   - pos22 â†’ pos23 (dirdown)

   - pos23 â†’ pos33 (dirright)

   - pos33 â†’ pos43 (dirright)

   - pos43 â†’ pos42 (dirup)

   So actions:

   move player1 pos11 pos12 dirdown

   move player1 pos12 pos22 dirright

   move player1 pos22 pos23 dirdown

   move player1 pos23 pos33 dirright

   move player1 pos33 pos43 dirright

   move player1 pos43 pos42 dirup

2. Push stone from pos32 to pos22 (dirup):

   pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos22 dirup

   Now, stone is at pos22, agent at pos32.

3. Move agent from pos32 to pos22 (dirup), but pos22 has the stone. Can't. So agent needs to move around.

   From pos32, move to pos31 (dirleft), then pos21 (dirleft), pos11 (dirleft).

   Actions:

   move player1 pos32 pos31 dirleft

   move player1 pos31 pos21 dirleft

   move player1 pos21 pos11 dirleft

4. Now agent is at pos11. Can push stone from pos22 to pos12 (dirup):

   Agent needs to be south of pos22 (pos32), but agent is at pos11. So this isn't possible. Alternative approach.

   Instead, after step 2, agent is at pos32. To push the stone from pos22 to pos12 (dirup), agent needs to be south of pos22 (pos32). So agent is already there. So action:

   pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos22 pos12 dirup

   Now, stone is at pos12, agent at pos22.

5. Now, agent is at pos22. Can push stone from pos12 to pos13 (dirright). Agent needs to be west of pos12 (pos11) and push east. But agent is at pos22. So need to move to pos11.

   Move from pos22 to pos21 (dirup), then pos11 (dirleft):

   move player1 pos22 pos21 dirup

   move player1 pos21 pos11 dirleft

6. Now, push stone from pos12 to pos13 (dirright):

   pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos11 pos12 pos13 dirright

   Preconditions:

   - Agent at pos11.

   - Stone at pos12.

   - pos13 is clear.

   - Can move from pos11 to pos12 via dirright? According to movement options, from pos11 to pos12 is dirdown, not dirright. So this precondition (iv) is not met. Therefore, this action is invalid.

So this approach fails.

Alternative idea: After step 4, stone is at pos12, agent at pos22. Agent needs to get to pos12's east to push it west. But that's not possible. Alternatively, push the stone up to pos11.

But pos11 is not a goal. So that's not helpful.

Alternatively, from pos22, the agent can move to pos23 (dirdown), then pos33 (dirright), pos43 (dirright), pos44 (dirdown), etc. But not helpful.

This is getting too complicated. Perhaps the optimal path is to move the agent to pos42, push the stone up to pos22, then move around to pos32, push up to pos12, then move to pos13 and push east, but considering the direction constraints.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a shorter path. Let me think again.

Another approach: The goal is to get the stone to pos15. Pos15 is a goal location. The stone is at pos32. The agent needs to push it there. The minimal number of steps would involve moving the stone up to row1 and right to column5.

But how?

Alternative plan:

1. Move agent from pos11 to pos31 (right, right):

   pos11 â†’ pos21 (dirright)

   pos21 â†’ pos31 (dirright)

2. Then move down to pos32 (dirdown). But pos32 is occupied by the stone. So can't. So instead, from pos31, move right to pos41 (dirright), then down to pos42 (dirdown).

   pos31 â†’ pos41 (dirright)

   pos41 â†’ pos42 (dirdown)

3. Now agent is at pos42. Push stone from pos32 to pos22 (dirup):

   pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos22 dirup

   Now, stone at pos22, agent at pos32.

4. Move agent from pos32 to pos31 (dirleft), then pos21 (dirleft), pos11 (dirleft).

   move player1 pos32 pos31 dirleft

   move player1 pos31 pos21 dirleft

   move player1 pos21 pos11 dirleft

5. Now agent is at pos11. Move down to pos12 (dirdown).

   move player1 pos11 pos12 dirdown

6. Push stone from pos22 to pos23 (dirdown):

   pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos12 pos22 pos23 dirdown

   Now, stone at pos23, agent at pos22.

7. Move agent from pos22 to pos23 (dirdown).

   move player1 pos22 pos23 dirdown

8. Push stone from pos23 to pos24 (dirdown):

   pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos23 pos24 dirdown â†’ Wait, can't push from pos23 to pos24. The stone is at pos23, agent is at pos23. To push, the agent must be adjacent. So agent must be at pos23's north, south, east, or west.

Wait, agent is at pos23. The stone is also at pos23. That's impossible. So this step is invalid.

This approach isn't working.

Alternative idea after step 3: stone at pos22, agent at pos32. 

From pos32, agent can move to pos33 (dirright), then pos43 (dirright), pos44 (dirdown), pos54 (dirright), etc. Not helpful.

Alternatively, agent can move from pos32 to pos33 (dirright), then pos34 (dirdown), pos44 (dirright), pos45 (dirdown), pos55 (dirright). But this doesn't help with the stone.

This is really challenging. Let's consider that the initial movement to pos42 to push the stone to pos22 is correct. Then, the agent is at pos32. From there, move to pos31, pos21, pos11. Then, move down to pos12. Then, push the stone from pos22 to pos23 (dirdown), but agent is at pos12. To push south from pos22, agent must be at pos22's north (pos12), so yes. So:

After step 3, stone at pos22, agent at pos32.

4. Move agent from pos32 to pos31 (dirleft)

   move player1 pos32 pos31 dirleft

5. Move to pos21 (dirleft)

   move player1 pos31 pos21 dirleft

6. Move to pos11 (dirleft)

   move player1 pos21 pos11 dirleft

7. Move down to pos12 (dirdown)

   move player1 pos11 pos12 dirdown

8. Push stone from pos22 to pos23 (dirdown):

   pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos12 pos22 pos23 dirdown

   Now, stone at pos23, agent at pos22.

9. Move agent from pos22 to pos23 (dirdown)

   move player1 pos22 pos23 dirdown

10. Push stone from pos23 to pos24 (dirdown):

    pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos23 pos24 dirdown â†’ invalid, as stone is at pos23, agent at pos23.

This isn't working. 

Alternative after step 8: stone at pos23, agent at pos22. Then, agent can move to pos23 (dirdown), then push east to pos24 (dirright). But pos24 is non-goal.

Alternatively, from pos23, push the stone east to pos24 (dirright). Agent needs to be west of pos23 (pos13). So agent needs to move to pos13.

But agent is at pos22. How to get to pos13?

 pos22 â†’ pos23 (dirdown)

 pos23 â†’ pos13 (dirleft). But movement from pos23 to pos13 is possible via dirleft.

 move player1 pos22 pos23 dirdown

 move player1 pos23 pos13 dirleft

 Now agent is at pos13.

 Push stone from pos23 to pos24 (dirright):

 pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos23 pos24 dirright.

 Preconditions:

 - Agent at pos13.

 - Stone at pos23.

 - pos24 is clear.

 - Can move from pos13 to pos23 via dirright. Check movement options: from pos13, can move right to pos23. Yes.

 So action is valid. Now stone is at pos24, agent at pos23.

 Continue pushing east to pos25, then pos35, etc. But this leads away from the goal.

This isn't helping. 

Given the time I've spent and the complexity, perhaps the optimal plan involves pushing the stone up to pos22, then pos12, then east to pos13, pos14, pos15. Even if the directions are problematic, maybe there's a way.

After pushing the stone to pos12, agent is at pos22. To push east to pos13, agent needs to be west of pos12 (pos11), but movement from pos11 to pos12 is dirdown. So the direction for the push would be dirright, but the agent's movement to pos12 is via dirdown. Therefore, the precondition (iv) is not met. Hence, invalid.

Alternative approach: Use the pushtogoal action when the destination is a goal location. Since pos15 is a goal location, the final push to pos15 must use pushtogoal.

So the final action must be pushtogoal, pushing the stone to pos15. For that, the stone must be at pos14, and the agent must be at pos14's west (pos13) to push east to pos15.

But how to get the stone to pos14.

Alternative plan:

1. Move agent to pos42 and push the stone to pos22.

2. Push the stone from pos22 to pos12.

3. Push the stone from pos12 to pos13.

4. Push to pos14.

5. Push to pos15.

But the problem is step 3: how to push from pos12 to pos13.

If the agent is at pos11, can they push east to pos13? As discussed earlier, no. The agent must be able to move from l_p to l_from (pos12) via direction d. So to push dirright (east) from pos12 to pos13, the agent must be able to move from l_p to pos12 via direction dirright. So l_p must be west of pos12 (pos11) and the direction is dirright. But movement from pos11 to pos12 is via dirdown, not dirright. Hence, invalid.

But perhaps the agent can approach from the south. For example, agent is at pos22, push the stone north to pos12. Then, agent moves to pos22, then east to pos23, pos24, etc., but not helpful.

Alternatively, after the stone is at pos12, the agent is at pos22. Then, the agent can move to pos21, pos31, pos32 (stone moved), then pos33, etc. Not helpful.

This is really tricky. Given the time I've spent, I think the correct plan involves the agent moving to pos42, pushing the stone north to pos22, then the agent moves around to push it up to pos12, then east to pos13, pos14, pos15. Even if the directions are a bit unclear, but given the problem's constraints, this might be the only way.

So here's the plan:

```
move player1 pos11 pos12 dirdown
move player1 pos12 pos22 dirright
move player1 pos22 pos23 dirdown
move player1 pos23 pos33 dirright
move player1 pos33 pos43 dirright
move player1 pos43 pos42 dirup
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos22 dirup
move player1 pos32 pos31 dirleft
move player1 pos31 pos21 dirleft
move player1 pos21 pos11 dirleft
move player1 pos11 pos12 dirdown
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos12 pos22 pos12 dirup
```

Wait, no. This is getting too convoluted. Perhaps the correct answer is:

```
move player1 pos11 pos12 dirdown
move player1 pos12 pos22 dirright
move player1 pos22 pos23 dirdown
move player1 pos23 pos33 dirright
move player1 pos33 pos43 dirright
move player1 pos43 pos42 dirup
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos22 dirup
move player1 pos32 pos22 dirup
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos22 pos12 dirup
move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos12 pos13 dirright
move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos14 pos13 pos14 dirright
pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos14 pos14 pos15 dirright
```

But this may not be valid. Alternatively, given the complexity, perhaps the optimal plan is:

```
move player1 pos11 pos21 dirright
move player1 pos21 pos31 dirright
move player1 pos31 pos32 dirdown
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos32 pos22 dirup
move player1 pos22 pos12 dirup
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos12 pos22 pos12 dirup
move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos12 pos13 dirright
move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos14 pos13 pos14 dirright
pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos14 pos14 pos15 dirright
```

But this assumes the agent can push the stone from pos32 to pos22 while being at pos32, which isn't possible because the agent can't be at the same location as the stone.

After struggling, I think the correct optimal plan involves the agent moving around to pos42, pushing the stone up to pos22, then moving to pos32, then pushing up to pos12, then moving east to push the stone to pos13, pos14, and finally pos15. However, the exact steps require careful checking of directions and preconditions.

Given time constraints, I'll provide the following plan based on the initial analysis:

```
move player1 pos11 pos12 dirdown
move player1 pos12 pos22 dirright
move player1 pos22 pos23 dirdown
move player1 pos23 pos33 dirright
move player1 pos33 pos43 dirright
move player1 pos43 pos42 dirup
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos22 dirup
move player1 pos32 pos22 dirup
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos22 pos12 dirup
move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos12 pos13 dirright
move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos14 pos13 pos14 dirright
pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos14 pos14 pos15 dirright
```

But I'm not confident about all the steps. However, given the problem's complexity and time constraints, this is the best I can do.
