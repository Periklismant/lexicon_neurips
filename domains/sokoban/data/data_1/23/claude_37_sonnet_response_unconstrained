Let's analyze the problem:

1. We have a 2D grid with positions from pos11 to pos55 (a 5x5 grid).
2. The player (player1) is at pos11.
3. A stone (stone1) is at pos32.
4. A goal location is at pos15.
5. To solve the problem, we need to move the stone to a goal location, which is pos15.

Now, I'll think about the plan:

1. First, we need to move the player from pos11 to a position adjacent to the stone (pos32) to be able to push it.
2. Then, we need to push the stone towards the goal location (pos15).

The most efficient path to get the stone to the goal location would be to push it from pos32 to pos15. To do this, the player needs to be on the side of the stone opposite to the direction we want to push.

Given the grid:
```
11 12 13 14 15
21 22 23 24 25
31 32 33 34 35
41 42 43 44 45
51 52 53 54 55
```

The player is at pos11, the stone is at pos32, and the goal is at pos15.

To move the stone from pos32 to pos15, let's try to push it upwards (towards pos31, pos21, etc). For that, the player needs to be below the stone (at pos33). But pushing the stone upwards might not be the best approach, as we'd need to then navigate a complex path to get to the goal. Let's think of a clearer path.

Actually, it might be easier to push the stone to the right and then up. Going from pos32 to pos33, pos34, pos35, and then up to pos25, pos15.

To push the stone right, the player needs to be to the left of the stone (at pos31).

Let's outline the plan:
1. Move player1 from pos11 to pos31 (passing through pos21).
2. Push stone1 from pos32 to pos33.
3. Push stone1 from pos33 to pos34.
4. Push stone1 from pos34 to pos35.
5. Push stone1 from pos35 to pos25.
6. Push stone1 from pos25 to pos15 (goal location).

Let's double-check this:
- Player starts at pos11
- Stone starts at pos32
- Goal is at pos15

So the plan looks reasonable. Let me now formalize the actions:

1. move player1 pos11 pos21 dirright
2. move player1 pos21 pos31 dirright
3. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos32 pos33 dirdown
4. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos33 pos34 dirdown
5. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos34 pos35 dirdown
6. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos35 pos25 dirleft
7. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos35 pos25 pos15 dirleft

Hmm, let me check a few of the actions to make sure I got them right:

For the first push action:
- player1 is at location pos31
- stone1 is at location pos32
- location pos33 is clear
- You can get from location pos31 to location pos32 following direction dirdown
- You can get from location pos32 to location pos33 following direction dirdown
- location pos33 is not a goal location

Actually, let me correct my misunderstandings. The directions dirup, dirdown, dirleft, and dirright refer to which way you're going on the grid.

So, looking at these movement predicates:

"You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright"
"You may move from location pos11 to location pos12 following direction dirdown"

It looks like "dirright" means "move right" (from pos11 to pos21, for example), and "dirdown" means "move down" (from pos11 to pos12).

So, to push stone1 from pos32 to pos33, the player would be at pos31 and would push the stone from pos32 (where the stone is) to pos33 (where it will be after the push).

Let me redo the plan:

1. Player is at pos11
2. Player moves to pos21 (dirright)
3. Player moves to pos31 (dirright)
4. Player pushes the stone from pos32 to pos33 (dirdown)
5. Player pushes the stone from pos33 to pos34 (dirdown)
6. Player pushes the stone from pos34 to pos35 (dirdown)
7. Player pushes the stone from pos35 to pos25 (dirleft)
8. Player pushes the stone from pos25 to pos15 (dirleft, which is our goal)

Now let's check the actions:

1. move player1 pos11 pos21 dirright
2. move player1 pos21 pos31 dirright
3. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos32 pos33 dirdown
   - player1 is at location pos31
   - stone1 is at location pos32
   - location pos33 is clear
   - You can get from location pos31 to location pos32 following direction dirdown
   - You can get from location pos32 to location pos33 following direction dirdown
   - location pos33 is not a goal location
4. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos33 pos34 dirdown
   - player1 is at location pos32
   - stone1 is at location pos33
   - location pos34 is clear
   - You can get from location pos32 to location pos33 following direction dirdown
   - You can get from location pos33 to location pos34 following direction dirdown
   - location pos34 is not a goal location
5. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos34 pos35 dirdown
   - player1 is at location pos33
   - stone1 is at location pos34
   - location pos35 is clear
   - You can get from location pos33 to location pos34 following direction dirdown
   - You can get from location pos34 to location pos35 following direction dirdown
   - location pos35 is not a goal location
6. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos35 pos25 dirleft
   - player1 is at location pos34
   - stone1 is at location pos35
   - location pos25 is clear
   - You can get from location pos34 to location pos35 following direction dirdown
   - You can get from location pos35 to location pos25 following direction dirleft
   - location pos25 is not a goal location
7. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos35 pos25 pos15 dirleft
   - player1 is at location pos35
   - stone1 is at location pos25
   - location pos15 is clear
   - You can get from location pos35 to location pos25 following direction dirleft
   - You can get from location pos25 to location pos15 following direction dirleft
   - location pos15 is a goal location

Actually, I just realized I'm making a mistake. I need to check the actual layout of the grid to understand the directions.

Let's look at these predicates:
"You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright"
"You may move from location pos11 to location pos12 following direction dirdown"

So, dirright means moving from pos11 to pos21, which means the first digit is the row (like in matrix notation) and the second digit is the column. So pos11 is at the top left of the grid, and dirright means moving along the row, increasing the first digit.

Given this understanding, the goal location pos15 is at the top right, and the stone at pos32 is somewhere in the middle (second row, third column).

Let me draw the grid again with this understanding:
```
11 21 31 41 51
12 22 32 42 52
13 23 33 43 53
14 24 34 44 54
15 25 35 45 55
```

Wait, actually that doesn't quite match up:

"You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright"

If dirright means moving right on the grid, and pos11 is the top left, then moving right would take you to another position in the top row. But pos21 seems to be in the second row. 

Let me double check some other movement predicates:

"You may move from location pos11 to location pos12 following direction dirdown"

If dirdown means moving down on the grid, and pos11 is the top left, then moving down would take you to pos12, which would be in the first column, second row. Which seems to match the understanding that the first digit is the column, and the second digit is the row.

So, the grid is actually:
```
11 12 13 14 15
21 22 23 24 25
31 32 33 34 35
41 42 43 44 45
51 52 53 54 55
```

Where:
- The player (player1) is at pos11 (top left)
- The stone (stone1) is at pos32 (third row, second column)
- The goal location is at pos15 (top right)

With this corrected understanding, let's create a plan:

1. Player is at pos11
2. Player moves to pos12 (dirdown)
3. Player moves to pos13 (dirdown)
4. Player moves to pos14 (dirdown)
5. Player moves to pos24 (dirright)
6. Player moves to pos34 (dirright)
7. Player moves to pos33 (dirup)
8. Player pushes stone1 from pos32 to pos22 (dirleft)
9. Player pushes stone1 from pos22 to pos12 (dirleft)
10. Player pushes stone1 from pos12 to pos13 (dirdown)
11. Player pushes stone1 from pos13 to pos14 (dirdown)
12. Player pushes stone1 from pos14 to pos15 (dirdown) (goal)

Actually, there is confusion about the grid layout and the directions. Let's really nail down our understanding of the grid:

Let me examine some of the predicates in more detail:

"You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright"
"You may move from location pos11 to location pos12 following direction dirdown"
"You may move from location pos12 to location pos22 following direction dirright"
"You may move from location pos12 to location pos11 following direction dirup"

Based on these, it seems:

1. Moving "dirright" from pos11 gives you pos21.
2. Moving "dirdown" from pos11 gives you pos12.
3. Moving "dirright" from pos12 gives you pos22.
4. Moving "dirup" from pos12 gives you pos11.

So the grid layout is:

```
11 21 31 41 51
12 22 32 42 52
13 23 33 43 53
14 24 34 44 54
15 25 35 45 55
```

Where the first digit corresponds to the column and the second corresponds to the row.

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let's try again:

"You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright" - Moving right from (1,1) should give you (2,1).
"You may move from location pos11 to location pos12 following direction dirdown" - Moving down from (1,1) should give you (1,2).

So, the first digit denotes the row and the second digit denotes the column.

Grid layout:
```
11 12 13 14 15
21 22 23 24 25
31 32 33 34 35
41 42 43 44 45
51 52 53 54 55
```

Yes, this makes sense now!

- The player (player1) is at pos11 (top left)
- The stone (stone1) is at pos32 (third row, second column)
- The goal location is at pos15 (top right)

With this understanding, let's re-create the plan:

1. Player is at pos11
2. Player moves to pos21 (dirright)
3. Player moves to pos31 (dirright)
4. Player moves to pos32 (dirdown)
5. Player moves to pos33 (dirdown)
6. Player pushes stone1 from pos32 to pos22 (dirup)
7. Player pushes stone1 from pos22 to pos12 (dirup)
8. Player pushes stone1 from pos12 to pos13 (dirright)
9. Player pushes stone1 from pos13 to pos14 (dirright)
10. Player pushes stone1 from pos14 to pos15 (dirright) (goal)

Wait, I made a mistake. The player is currently at pos11, and stone1 is at pos32. I want to move the stone from pos32 to pos15 (to reach a goal location).

Let's work out a plan for this:

1. Player moves from pos11 to pos21 (dirright)
2. Player moves from pos21 to pos31 (dirright)
3. Player moves from pos31 to pos32 (dirdown)
4. Player moves from pos32 to pos33 (dirdown)
5. Player pushes stone1 from pos32 to pos22 (dirup)
6. Player pushes stone1 from pos22 to pos12 (dirup)
7. Player pushes stone1 from pos12 to pos13 (dirright)
8. Player pushes stone1 from pos13 to pos14 (dirright)
9. Player pushes stone1 from pos14 to pos15 (dirright) (goal)

Wait, there's a mistake. If the player is at pos33, and stone1 is at pos32, pushing the stone in the "up" direction would move the stone from pos32 to pos22, but the player would need to be below the stone (at pos42) to do this push. So the player would need to move from pos33 to pos32 to pos31 to pos41 to pos42, and then push the stone from pos32 to pos22.

Ok, let's back up a bit. Instead, I think a better approach is to have the player go around to the other side of the stone and push it towards the goal.

Given:
1. Player is at pos11
2. Stone is at pos32
3. Goal is at pos15 (top right)

1. Player moves from pos11 to pos21 (dirright)
2. Player moves from pos21 to pos31 (dirright)
3. Player moves from pos31 to pos41 (dirright)
4. Player moves from pos41 to pos42 (dirdown)
5. Player pushes stone1 from pos42 pos32 pos22 dirleft (Pushing the stone from the right side to move it left)
6. Player pushes stone1 from pos22 pos12 dirleft
7. Player pushes stone1 from pos12 pos13 dirright
8. Player pushes stone1 from pos13 pos14 dirright
9. Player pushes stone1 from pos14 pos15 dirright (Goal, this push will be a pushtogoal action)

Actually I'm confused again about the layout. Let me try to really understand this grid:

"You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright"

This means moving from (1,1) to (2,1) when going right. So first digit is row, second is column, and the action is to "move right", resulting in a change in row from 1 to 2.

"You may move from location pos11 to location pos12 following direction dirdown"

This means moving from (1,1) to (1,2) when going down. So first digit is row, second is column, and the action is to "move down", resulting in a change in column from 1 to 2.

This makes sense. Let's redraw the grid, where the first digit represents the row and the second digit represents the column:

```
11 12 13 14 15
21 22 23 24 25
31 32 33 34 35
41 42 43 44 45
51 52 53 54 55
```

Ok, with this understanding:
- The player (player1) is at pos11 (top left)
- The stone (stone1) is at pos32 (3rd row, 2nd column)
- The goal location is at pos15 (1st row, 5th column, or the top right)

Let's create a plan:

1. Player moves from pos11 to pos21 (dirright)
2. Player moves from pos21 to pos31 (dirright)
3. Player moves from pos31 to pos41 (dirright)
4. Player moves from pos41 to pos42 (dirdown)
5. Player pushes stone1 from pos32 to pos22 by first reaching pos42, which is directly to the right of the stone. The action is pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos22 dirleft.
6. After step 5, the player will be at pos32 and the stone will be at pos22. Now player needs to push stone1 from pos22 to pos12 by first getting to the position below the stone (pos32). The action is pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos22 pos12 dirup.
7. After step 6, the player will be at pos22 and the stone will be at pos12. Now the player needs to push stone1 from pos12 to pos13 by first getting to the position to the left of the stone (pos11). The action is pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos11 pos12 pos13 dirright.
8. After step 7, the player will be at pos12 and the stone will be at pos13. Now the player needs to push stone1 from pos13 to pos14 by first getting to the position to the left of the stone (pos12). The action is pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos12 pos13 pos14 dirright.
9. After step 8, the player will be at pos13 and the stone will be at pos14. Now the player needs to push stone1 from pos14 to pos15 by first getting to the position to the left of the stone (pos13). The action is pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos14 pos15 dirright.

That should bring the stone to a goal location.

Wait, I realize I've been making a critical mistake in the interpretation of the "push" actions. The preconditions for the push action are:

"(i) agent p is at location l_p,
(ii) stone s is at location l_from,
(iii) location l_to is clear,
(iv) you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d,
(v) you can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d,"

So the player needs to be in a position where they can push the stone in the direction d, which means the player should be on the opposite side of the stone in relation to the direction they want to push.

For example, to push the stone from pos32 to pos22 in the direction dirup, the player would need to be at pos42.

Ok, let's actually trace out this plan carefully:

1. Player is at pos11 and stone is at pos32.
2. To push the stone from pos32 to pos22 in the direction dirup, the player needs to be at pos42.
3. Player moves from pos11 to pos21 (dirright)
4. Player moves from pos21 to pos31 (dirright)
5. Player moves from pos31 to pos41 (dirright)
6. Player moves from pos41 to pos42 (dirdown)
7. Now player is at pos42 and can push the stone from pos32 to pos22: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos22 dirup
8. After the push, the player is at pos32 and the stone is at pos22.
9. To push the stone from pos22 to pos12 in the direction dirup, the player needs to be at pos32, which they already are.
10. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos22 pos12 dirup
11. After this push, the player is at pos22 and the stone is at pos12.
12. To push the stone from pos12 to pos13 in the direction dirright, the player needs to be at pos11.
13. Player moves from pos22 to pos21 (dirup)
14. Player moves from pos21 to pos11 (dirleft)
15. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos11 pos12 pos13 dirright
16. After this push, the player is at pos12 and the stone is at pos13.
17. To push the stone from pos13 to pos14 in the direction dirright, the player needs to be at pos12, which they already are.
18. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos12 pos13 pos14 dirright
19. After this push, the player is at pos13 and the stone is at pos14.
20. To push the stone from pos14 to pos15 in the direction dirright, the player needs to be at pos13, which they already are.
21. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos14 pos15 dirright
22. The stone is now at pos15, which is a goal location.

Let's write out the full plan:

1. move player1 pos11 pos21 dirright
2. move player1 pos21 pos31 dirright
3. move player1 pos31 pos41 dirright
4. move player1 pos41 pos42 dirdown
5. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos22 dirup
6. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos22 pos12 dirup
7. move player1 pos22 pos21 dirup
8. move player1 pos21 pos11 dirleft
9. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos11 pos12 pos13 dirright
10. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos12 pos13 pos14 dirright
11. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos14 pos15 dirright

But I'm a bit confused still. Let's re-understand the layout.

Let's double check with these predicates:

"You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright"
"You may move from location pos11 to location pos12 following direction dirdown"

So, moving right from pos11 gives pos21. If the first digit is x and the second is y, then (1,1) to (2,1) is a move to the right, and (1,1) to (1,2) is a move downward. This aligns with the usual convention in graphics. So the layout is:

```
11 21 31 41 51
12 22 32 42 52
13 23 33 43 53
14 24 34 44 54
15 25 35 45 55
```

And:
- Player starts at pos11 (top left)
- Stone is at pos32 (third column, second row)
- Goal is at pos15 (first column, fifth row, which is bottom left)

Wait, that doesn't seem right for the goal. Let's check again.

"pos15 is a goal location"

So the goal is at pos15, which is (1,5). Following the grid layout above, that's the first column, fifth row, which is the bottom left.

That's a bit unusual; I'd expected the goal to be at the top right. But let's go with it.

Given:
- Player starts at pos11 (top left)
- Stone is at pos32 (third column, second row)
- Goal is at pos15 (first column, fifth row, which is bottom left)

Let's rethink our plan:

1. We need to push the stone from pos32 to pos15, which means moving it down and to the left.
2. Starting from pos11, the player can move to the right of the stone (pos42) to push it left, or above the stone (pos31) to push it down. Given the goal is below and to the left, it makes sense to prioritize moving the stone to the left first.

Here's the plan:

1. Player moves from pos11 to pos21 (dirright)
2. Player moves from pos21 to pos31 (dirright)
3. Player moves from pos31 to pos41 (dirright)
4. Player moves from pos41 to pos42 (dirdown)
5. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos22 dirleft
   (After this, player is at pos32, stone is at pos22)
6. Player moves from pos32 to pos33 (dirdown)
7. Player moves from pos33 to pos23 (dirleft)
8. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos22 pos12 dirleft
   (After this, player is at pos22, stone is at pos12)
9. move player1 pos22 pos23 dirdown
10. move player1 pos23 pos13 dirleft
11. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos12 pos11 dirleft
    (After this, player is at pos12, stone is at pos11)
12. move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown
13. move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown
14. move player1 pos14 pos15 dirdown
15. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos15 pos11 pos12 dirdown
    (After this, player is at pos11, stone is at pos12)
16. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos11 pos12 pos13 dirdown
    (After this, player is at pos12, stone is at pos13)
17. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos12 pos13 pos14 dirdown
    (After this, player is at pos13, stone is at pos14)
18. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos14 pos15 dirdown
    (After this, player is at pos14, stone is at pos15, which is the goal)

But wait, I'm still confused about the layout.

Looking at the provided facts:
"pos15 is a goal location"
"Player starts at pos11"
"Stone is at pos32"

Let me trace through the full list of movements that I'd expect:

"You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright"
"You may move from location pos11 to location pos12 following direction dirdown"
"You may move from location pos15 to location pos25 following direction dirright"
"You may move from location pos15 to location pos14 following direction dirup"

Now, based on these, let's infer the layout.

"You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright"
This indicates that going right from pos11 takes us to pos21. This means the first digit increases when going right.

"You may move from location pos11 to location pos12 following direction dirdown"
This indicates that going down from pos11 takes us to pos12. This means the second digit increases when going down.

"You may move from location pos15 to location pos14 following direction dirup"
This indicates that going up from pos15 takes us to pos14. This means the second digit decreases when going up.

Considering all of these, I think the layout is:

```
11 21 31 41 51
12 22 32 42 52
13 23 33 43 53
14 24 34 44 54
15 25 35 45 55
```

But to reconfirm, let me also check this predicate:

"You may move from location pos15 to location pos25 following direction dirright"
This indicates that going right from pos15 takes us to pos25. This means the first digit increases when going right, which aligns with the layout I've inferred.

So, the grid is laid out as described above, where:
- The first digit determines the column (increases when going right).
- The second digit determines the row (increases when going down).

Given this layout:
- Player starts at pos11 (top left)
- Stone is at pos32 (third column, second row)
- Goal is at pos15 (first column, fifth row, which is bottom left)

Actually, looking at the effects of a successful pushtogoal action:
"After performing this action, (i) agent p is no longer at location l_p, (ii) stone s is no longer at location l_from, (iii) location l_to is no longer clear, (iv) agent p is at location l_from, (v) stone s is at location l_to, (vi) location l_p is clear, and (vi) stone s is at a goal state."

So the real goal is not for the stone to be at a specific position but for it to be in a "goal state", which is achieved by having the stone at a "goal location".

From the given facts, the only goal location is pos15: "pos15 is a goal location"

So the stone needs to be pushed to pos15, which is in the first column, fifth row (bottom left of the grid).

Let's now trace out a plan to achieve this:

1. Player is at pos11.
2. Stone is at pos32.
3. Goal is at pos15.
4. To push the stone downwards from its current position, the player needs to be above the stone.

Given the grid:
```
11 21 31 41 51
12 22 32 42 52
13 23 33 43 53
14 24 34 44 54

The player at pos11 first needs to navigate to get above the stone at pos32. Then, the player can push the stone downwards towards the goal.

Here's the plan:

1. move player1 pos11 pos21 dirright
2. move player1 pos21 pos31 dirright
3. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos32 pos33 dirdown
   (After this, player is at pos32, stone is at pos33)
4. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos33 pos34 dirdown
   (After this, player is at pos33, stone is at pos34)
5. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos34 pos35 dirdown
   (After this, player is at pos34, stone is at pos35)
6. move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft
7. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos35 pos25 dirleft
   (After this, player is at pos35, stone is at pos25)
8. move player1 pos35 pos34 dirup
9. move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft
10. move player1 pos24 pos14 dirleft
11. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos14 pos25 pos15 dirleft
    (After this, player is at pos25, stone is at pos15, which is the goal)

Actually, I think I'm still confusing myself. Let's double check the posxy format again to understand the grid.

In a grid, the typical format is (x, y), where x is the column and y is the row. However, it appears that in the problem, posxy represents (row, column).

From the motion predicates:

"You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright"
This indicates that going right from pos11 takes us to pos21. If we interpret posxy as (row, column), then row 1, column 1 to row 2, column 1 is not a move to the right but down. This doesn't align with what the predicate is saying. However, if we interpret posxy as (column, row), then column 1, row 1 to column 2, row 1 is a move to the right, which aligns with the predicate.

"You may move from location pos11 to location pos12 following direction dirdown"
This indicates that going down from pos11 takes us to pos12. If we interpret posxy as (column, row), then column 1, row 1 to column 1, row 2 is a move down, which aligns with the predicate.

Given these, it seems more consistent to interpret posxy as (column, row). This would mean:

- Player starts at pos11 (column 1, row 1, which is top left)
- Stone is at pos32 (column 3, row 2, which is to the right and down from the top left)
- Goal is at pos15 (column 1, row 5, which is bottom left)

But this contradicts my earlier understanding, and I'm getting confused again. Let's really go line by line to understand the predicates:

"You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright"
This shows that moving right from pos11 gives us pos21. Let's denote pos11 as (x, y) and pos21 as (x', y'). Moving right would typically mean that the column increases, so x' = x + 1 and y' = y. This gives (x + 1, y), or if we apply the actual values, (2, 1).

"You may move from location pos12 to location pos22 following direction dirright"
Similarly, moving right from pos12 gives us pos22. If pos12 is (1, 2), then pos22 is (2, 2).

"You may move from location pos11 to location pos12 following direction dirdown"
Moving down from pos11 gives us pos12. If pos11 is (1, 1), then pos12 is (1, 2).

Based on these, it seems that in posxy, x corresponds to the column and y corresponds to the row, such that moving right increases x and moving down increases y.

With this understanding:

Grid:
```
(1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (4,1) (5,1)
(1,2) (2,2) (3,2) (4,2) (5,2)
(1,3) (2,3) (3,3) (4,3) (5,3)
(1,4) (2,4) (3,4) (4,4) (5,4)
(1,5) (2,5) (3,5) (4,5) (5,5)
```

or in the format given:
```
pos11 pos21 pos31 pos41 pos51
pos12 pos22 pos32 pos42 pos52
pos13 pos23 pos33 pos43 pos53
pos14 pos24 pos34 pos44 pos54
pos15 pos25 pos35 pos45 pos55
```

With pos11 at the top left, the layout looks like this. I've marked the player (P), the stone (S), and the goal (G):

```
P... .....
..... .S...
..... .....
..... .....
G.... .....
```

So, the player is at the top left, the stone is in the middle, and the goal is at the bottom left. Let's now develop a plan.

To get the stone to the goal:
1. The player needs to push the stone down to row 5.
2. The player then needs to push the stone left to column 1.

Given the stone is at (3, 2), the player could first push it to (3, 3), (3, 4), and (3, 5). Then, the player could push it left to (2, 5) and finally to (1, 5).

Here's the plan:

1. move player1 pos11 pos21 dirright
2. move player1 pos21 pos31 dirright
3. move player1 pos31 pos32 dirdown
4. move player1 pos32 pos33 dirdown
5. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos32 pos31 dirleft
   (After this, player is at pos32, stone is at pos31)
6. move player1 pos32 pos33 dirdown
7. move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft
8. move player1 pos23 pos22 dirup
9. move player1 pos22 pos21 dirup
10. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos21 pos31 pos41 dirright
    (After this, player is at pos31, stone is at pos41)
11. move player1 pos31 pos32 dirdown
12. move player1 pos32 pos42 dirright
13. move player1 pos42 pos43 dirdown
14. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos41 pos42 dirright
    (After this, player is at pos41, stone is at pos42)
15. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos41 pos42 pos43 dirright
    (After this, player is at pos42, stone is at pos43)
16. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos43 pos44 dirright
    (After this, player is at pos43, stone is at pos44)
17. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos44 pos45 dirright
    (After this, player is at pos44, stone is at pos45)
18. move player1 pos44 pos34 dirleft
19. move player1 pos34 pos35 dirdown
20. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos35 pos45 pos55 dirdown
    (After this, player is at pos45, stone is at pos55)
21. move player1 pos45 pos44 dirup
22. move player1 pos44 pos43 dirup
23. move player1 pos43 pos42 dirup
24. move player1 pos42 pos41 dirup
25. move player1 pos41 pos51 dirright
26. move player1 pos51 pos52 dirdown
27. move player1 pos52 pos53 dirdown
28. move player1 pos53 pos54 dirdown
29. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos54 pos55 pos45 dirleft
    (After this, player is at pos55, stone is at pos45)
30. move player1 pos55 pos54 dirup
31. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos54 pos45 pos35 dirleft
    (After this, player is at pos45, stone is at pos35)
32. move player1 pos45 pos44 dirup
33. move player1 pos44 pos34 dirleft
34. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos35 pos25 dirleft
    (After this, player is at pos35, stone is at pos25)
35. move player1 pos35 pos34 dirup
36. move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft
37. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos25 pos15 dirleft
    (After this, player is at pos25, stone is at pos15, which is the goal)

Hmm, I think there might be a more efficient way, let me just double check the grid one more time.

From the initial conditions, I understand:
- The player (player1) is at pos11 (top left).
- A stone (stone1) is at pos32 (third column, second row).
- A goal location is at pos15 (first column, fifth row, which is bottom left).

I need a plan to push the stone to the goal location.

Let me check the constraints of the "push" actions. From the preconditions I understand that the player can only push stones from a position adjacent to them in a particular direction. For instance, if the player is at pos31 (to the left of the stone), they can push the stone from pos32 to pos33 in the "dirright" direction.

Given this, let's create a more efficient plan to move the stone to the goal:

1. Player moves from pos11 to pos21 (dirright)
2. Player moves from pos21 to pos31 (dirright)
3. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos32 pos33 dirright
   (After this push, the player will be at pos32 and the stone will be at pos33)
4. move player1 pos32 pos33 dirright
   (Now the player is at pos33 and the stone is at pos33 - this is impossible)

Ok that doesn't work. Let me break it down more carefully. The grid is:

```
P... .....
..... .S...
..... .....
..... .....
G.... .....
```

P: player1 at pos11
S: stone1 at pos32
G: goal at pos15

To push the stone from pos32 to the goal pos15, we need to:
1. Push the stone down to row 5
2. Push the stone left to column 1

For the first push, the player needs to be above the stone. For this, the player can go around the stone and position themselves at pos33 (below the stone).

Oh wait, I think I misunderstood the direction. Let me check the "push" action description again.

For the pushtonongoal action:
"You may only perform this action if ... (iv) you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d, (v) you can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d"

So, the direction d is the direction in which the player-stone-empty_space are aligned. If the player is at pos42 (to the right of the stone) and the stone is at pos32, then the player can push the stone to pos22 in the "dirleft" direction (because both the player-to-stone and stone-to-destination are in the "dirleft" direction).

I was right before! I think I just got confused because of the grid representation. The player can push the stone only in the direction in which the player and the stone are aligned.

Now for a clearer plan:

1. Player moves from pos11 to pos21 (dirright)
2. Player moves from pos21 to pos31 (dirright)
3. Player moves from pos31 to pos41 (dirright)
4. Player moves from pos41 to pos42 (dirdown)
5. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos22 dirleft
   (After this, player is at pos32, stone is at pos22)
6. move player1 pos32 pos33 dirdown
7. move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft
8. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos22 pos12 dirleft
   (After this, player is at pos22, stone is at pos12)
9. move player1 pos22 pos23 dirdown
10. move player1 pos23 pos13 dirleft
11. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos12 pos11 dirleft
    (After this, player is at pos12, stone is at pos11)
12. move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown
13. move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown
14. move player1 pos14 pos15 dirdown
15. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos15 pos11 pos12 dirdown
    (After this, player is at pos11, stone is at pos12)
16. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos11 pos12 pos13 dirdown
    (After this, player is at pos12, stone is at pos13)
17. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos12 pos13 pos14 dirdown
    (After this, player is at pos13, stone is at pos14)
18. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos14 pos15 dirdown
    (After this, player is at pos14, stone is at pos15, which is the goal)

But wait, I think I'm forcing my own understanding of which square is the "goal" onto the problem. From the facts, we know "pos15 is a goal location", which means pos15 (not any other position) is the goal location. So, the goal is to push the stone to pos15, not just any goal.

Actually, this doesn't contradict my plan. The goal is at pos15, and my plan does push the stone to pos15. But the more I think about it, I'm realizing there might be a more efficient path.

Given P = player at pos11, S = stone at pos32, and G = goal at pos15:

1. Player can first move to pos31 (to the left of the stone).
2. Player can then push the stone from pos32 to pos33 (to the right).
3. Player can then go around and push the stone downwards multiple times until it's at pos35.
4. Then, the player can push the stone left multiple times until it's at pos15.

Let's trace it out:

1. move player1 pos11 pos21 dirright
2. move player1 pos21 pos31 dirright
3. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos32 pos33 dirright
   (After this, player is at pos32, stone is at pos33)
4. move player1 pos32 pos42 dirright
5. move player1 pos42 pos43 dirdown
6. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos33 pos34 dirdown
   (After this, player is at pos33, stone is at pos34)
7. move player1 pos33 pos43 dirright
8. move player1 pos43 pos44 dirdown
9. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos34 pos35 dirdown
   (After this, player is at pos34, stone is at pos35)
10. move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup
11. move player1 pos33 pos32 dirup
12. move player1 pos32 pos31 dirup
13. move player1 pos31 pos21 dirleft
14. move player1 pos21 pos11 dirleft
15. move player1 pos11 pos12 dirdown
16. move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown
17. move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown
18. move player1 pos14 pos15 dirdown
19. move player1 pos15 pos25 dirright
20. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos25 pos35 pos34 dirleft
   (After this, player is at pos35, stone is at pos34)
21. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos35 pos34 pos33 dirleft
   (After this, player is at pos34, stone is at pos33)
22. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos33 pos32 dirleft
   (After this, player is at pos33, stone is at pos32)
23. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos32 pos31 dirleft
   (After this, player is at pos32, stone is at pos31)
24. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos31 pos21 dirleft
   (After this, player is at pos31, stone is at pos21)
25. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos21 pos11 dirleft
   (After this, player is at pos21, stone is at pos11)
26. move player1 pos21 pos22 dirdown
27. move player1 pos22 pos23 dirdown
28. move player1 pos23 pos24 dirdown
29. move player1 pos24 pos25 dirdown
30. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos25 pos15 pos14 dirup
   (After this, player is at pos15, stone is at pos14)
31. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos15 pos14 pos13 dirup
   (After this, player is at pos14, stone is at pos13)
32. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos14 pos13 pos12 dirup
   (After this, player is at pos13, stone is at pos12)
33. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos12 pos11 dirup
   (After this, player is at pos12, stone is at pos11)
34. move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown
35. move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown
36. move player1 pos14 pos15 dirdown
37. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos15 pos11 pos12 dirdown
   (After this, player is at pos11, stone is at pos12)
38. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos11 pos12 pos13 dirdown
   (After this, player is at pos12, stone is at pos13)
39. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos12 pos13 pos14 dirdown
   (After this, player is at pos13, stone is at pos14)
40. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos14 pos15 dirdown
   (After this, player is at pos14, stone is at pos15, which is the goal)

This is a bit long. Let me see if there's an even more efficient path.

Actually, let me think of the solution another way. The stone is at (3,2) and we want to push it to (1,5). We could:

1. First, push it to (1,2) by moving it left.
2. Then, push it from (1,2) to (1,5) by moving it down.

Let's trace it out:

1. move player1 pos11 pos21 dirright
2. move player1 pos21 pos31 dirright
3. move player1 pos31 pos41 dirright
4. move player1 pos41 pos42 dirdown
5. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos22 dirleft
   (After this, player is at pos32, stone is at pos22)
6. move player1 pos32 pos33 dirdown
7. move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft
8. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos22 pos12 dirleft
   (After this, player is at pos22, stone is at pos12)
9. move player1 pos22 pos23 dirdown
10. move player1 pos23 pos13 dirleft
11. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos12 pos11 dirleft
    (After this, player is at pos12, stone is at pos11)
12. move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown
13. move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown
14. move player1 pos14 pos15 dirdown
15. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos15 pos11 pos12 dirdown
    (After this, player is at pos11, stone is at pos12)
16. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos11 pos12 pos13 dirdown
    (After this, player is at pos12, stone is at pos13)
17. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos12 pos13 pos14 dirdown
    (After this, player is at pos13, stone is at pos14)
18. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos14 pos15 dirdown
    (After this, player is at pos14, stone is at pos15, which is the goal)

It seems our plan has 18 steps. Let's check if we can do even better!

Actually, no, this seems to be the most efficient path. Let's go over the initial conditions and the task once more to double check.

Initial conditions:
1. Player (player1) is at position pos11 (top left of the grid, column 1, row 1).
2. Stone (stone1) is at position pos32 (right and down from the player, column 3, row 2).
3. Position pos15 (bottom left of the grid, column 1, row 5) is the goal location.

I'll update the visual to be clearer:

```
1 2 3 4 5
1 P . . . .
2 . . S . .
3 . . . . .
4 . . . . .
5 G . . . .
```

Task: Push the stone to the goal location (pos15).

The plan:
1. Push the stone leftwards from pos32 to pos12.
2. Push the stone downwards from pos12 to pos15.

Here's the complete plan:

1. move player1 pos11 pos21 dirright
2. move player1 pos21 pos31 dirright
3. move player1 pos31 pos41 dirright
4. move player1 pos41 pos42 dirdown
5. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos22 dirleft
6. move player1 pos32 pos33 dirdown
7. move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft
8. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos22 pos12 dirleft
9. move player1 pos22 pos23 dirdown
10. move player1 pos23 pos13 dirleft
11. move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown
12. move player1 pos14 pos15 dirdown
13. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos15 pos12 pos13 dirdown
14. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos13 pos14 dirdown
15. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos14 pos15 dirdown

Actually, steps 11 and 12 are unnecessary; the player can push the stone from pos13 directly. And step 14 is incorrect, the player would be at pos12 after the previous push, not pos13. Let me fix it:

1. move player1 pos11 pos21 dirright
2. move player1 pos21 pos31 dirright
3. move player1 pos31 pos41 dirright
4. move player1 pos41 pos42 dirdown
5. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos22 dirleft
6. move player1 pos32 pos33 dirdown
7. move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft
8. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos22 pos12 dirleft
9. move player1 pos22 pos23 dirdown
10. move player1 pos23 pos13 dirleft
11. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos12 pos13 dirdown
12. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos12 pos13 pos14 dirdown
13. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos14 pos15 dirdown

Ah, but I'm still making mistakes. After step 8, the player is at pos22 and the stone is at pos12. To push the stone down, the player needs to get to pos11, not pos13.

My bad, I accidentally mixed up the coordinates. Let me redo the entire plan, paying attention to the coordinates after each action.

Initial positions:
- Player is at pos11
- Stone is at pos32
- Goal is at pos15

Plan:
1. move player1 pos11 pos21 dirright
   (Player now at pos21, stone at pos32)
2. move player1 pos21 pos31 dirright
   (Player now at pos31, stone at pos32)
3. move player1 pos31 pos41 dirright
   (Player now at pos41, stone at pos32)
4. move player1 pos41 pos42 dirdown
   (Player now at pos42, stone at pos32)
5. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos22 dirleft
   (Player now at pos32, stone at pos22)
6. move player1 pos32 pos33 dirdown
   (Player now at pos33, stone at pos22)
7. move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft
   (Player now at pos23, stone at pos22)
8. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos22 pos12 dirleft
   (Player now at pos22, stone at pos12)
9. move player1 pos22 pos21 dirup
   (Player now at pos21, stone at pos12)
10. move player1 pos21 pos11 dirleft
    (Player now at pos11, stone at pos12)
11. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos11 pos12 pos13 dirdown
    (Player now at pos12, stone at pos13)
12. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos12 pos13 pos14 dirdown
    (Player now at pos13, stone at pos14)
13. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos14 pos15 dirdown
    (Player now at pos14, stone at pos15, which is the goal)

Let me double check this plan:

1. Player is at pos11, push is at initial position pos32
2. Player moves right to pos21
3. Player moves right to pos31
4. Player moves right to pos41
5. Player moves down to pos42, now the player is to the right of the stone and can push it left.
6. Player pushes stone from pos32 to pos22. Player is now at pos32, and stone is at pos22.
7. Player moves down to pos33.
8. Player moves left to pos23, and now the player is below the stone and can push it left.
9. Player pushes stone from pos22 to pos12. Player is now at pos22, and stone is at pos12.
10. Player moves up to pos21.
11. Player moves left to pos11, and now the player is to the left of the stone and can push it down.
12. Player pushes stone from pos12 to pos13. Player is now at pos12, and stone is at pos13.
13. Player pushes stone from pos13 to pos14. Player is now at pos13, and stone is at pos14.
14. Player pushes stone from pos14 to pos15 (the goal). Player is now at pos14, and stone is at pos15.

Ok, wait that was 14 steps. Lemme double check:

1. move player1 pos11 pos21 dirright
2. move player1 pos21 pos31 dirright
3. move player1 pos31 pos41 dirright
4. move player1 pos41 pos42 dirdown
5. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos22 dirleft
6. move player1 pos32 pos33 dirdown
7. move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft
8. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos22 pos12 dirleft
9. move player1 pos22 pos21 dirup
10. move player1 pos21 pos11 dirleft
11. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos11 pos12 pos13 dirdown
12. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos12 pos13 pos14 dirdown
13. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos14 pos15 dirdown

Yep, that's 13 steps. Looks right to me!

However, I noticed a mistake in step 11. The direction shouldn't be "dirdown", because the player is to the left of the stone and wants to push it right. So it should be "dirright". Similarly, step 12 should be "dirright" and step 13 should be "dirright".

But actually, checking again, I'm still confused. The player is at pos11 (top left) and the stone is at pos12 (below the player). So to push the stone down further, the direction should be "dirdown".

I think the confusion is in my interpretation of the grid. Let me double-check the grid layout once more.

From the constraints in the problem:
"You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright"
"You may move from location pos11 to location pos12 following direction dirdown"

So, from pos11 (1,1):
- Moving right gives us pos21 (2,1)
- Moving down gives us pos12 (1,2)

We're talking about a standard x-y grid, where the first digit is the column (x-coordinate) and the second digit is the row (y-coordinate). This confirms my interpretation.

Given that, here's the corrected plan:

Initial positions:
- Player is at pos11 (top left, column 1, row 1)
- Stone is at pos32 (column 3, row 2)
- Goal is at pos15 (column 1, row 5, bottom left)

Plan:
1. move player1 pos11 pos21 dirright
   (Player now at pos21, stone at pos32)
2. move player1 pos21 pos31 dirright
   (Player now at pos31, stone at pos32)
3. move player1 pos31 pos41 dirright
   (Player now at pos41, stone at pos32)
4. move player1 pos41 pos42 dirdown
   (Player now at pos42, stone at pos32)
5. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos22 dirleft
   (Player now at pos32, stone at pos22)
6. move player1 pos32 pos33 dirdown
   (Player now at pos33, stone at pos22)
7. move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft
   (Player now at pos23, stone at pos22)
8. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos22 pos12 dirleft
   (Player now at pos22, stone at pos12)
9. move player1 pos22 pos21 dirup
   (Player now at pos21, stone at pos12)
10. move player1 pos21 pos11 dirleft
    (Player now at pos11, stone at pos12)
11. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos11 pos12 pos13 dirdown
    (Player now at pos12, stone at pos13)
12. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos12 pos13 pos14 dirdown
    (Player now at pos13, stone at pos14)
13. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos14 pos15 dirdown
    (Player now at pos14, stone at pos15, which is the goal)

This 13-step plan seems optimal to me. Pushing the stone from its initial position at (3,2) to (1,2) and then from (1,2) to (1,5) is the most direct route to the goal.

Let me just check the stone's position in the initial location:

"stone1 is at location pos32" means column 3, row 2. And pos15 (the goal) means column 1, row 5. In the last corrected plan, I accounted for these locations correctly.

In a double check, the steps are:
1. move player1 pos11 pos21 dirright
2. move player1 pos21 pos31 dirright
3. move player1 pos31 pos41 dirright
4. move player1 pos41 pos42 dirdown
5. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos22 dirleft
6. move player1 pos32 pos33 dirdown
7. move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft
8. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos22 pos12 dirleft
9. move player1 pos22 pos21 dirup
10. move player1 pos21 pos11 dirleft
11. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos11 pos12 pos13 dirdown
12. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos12 pos13 pos14 dirdown
13. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos14 pos15 dirdown

I believe the 13-step plan is optimal and will successfully move stone1 to the goal location pos15.
