Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. The goal is to get stone1 to a goal location. From the initial state, I see that stone1 is at pos32, and the only goal location mentioned is pos33. So the target is to move stone1 from pos32 to pos33.

First, check where the agent is. The agent, player1, is at pos22. To push the stone, the agent needs to be adjacent to it. Stone1 is at pos32. Looking at the movement possibilities, pos22 is connected to pos32 via direction dirright. So the agent can move from pos22 to pos32 by moving right. Wait, but according to the "move" action preconditions, the agent can only move if the target location is clear. Initially, pos32 has the stone, so it's not clear. So the agent can't just move there directly.

Wait, the initial state says "Location pos32 is clear". Wait no, the original state says "stone1 is at location pos32", so pos32 is occupied by the stone. But in the list of clear locations, pos32 is not listed as clear. Wait, looking back: the original state lists "Location pos32 is clear" as false because the stone is there. Wait no, the initial state lists "Location pos32 is clear" as part of the original state. Wait, let me check again.

Looking at the original state statements:

- "player1 is at location pos22"
- "stone1 is at location pos32"
- Then a list of locations that are clear. For example, "Location pos11 is clear", "Location pos12 is clear", etc. Then at the end, "Location pos22 is clear" and "Location pos32 is clear". Wait, but pos22 has the player, so how is it clear? That might be a mistake. Wait, perhaps the initial state has a typo. Because if player1 is at pos22, then pos22 should not be clear. But according to the original state description, "Location pos22 is clear" is listed. That's conflicting. Hmm, maybe there's an error here. But assuming the problem is correctly stated, perhaps "clear" means that there's no stone there. Because the agent and stones are separate. So a location is clear if there's no stone. Because the agent can be on a location that's considered clear for stones. Wait, but the action preconditions for "move" say that the target location must be clear. So "clear" probably refers to not having any object (agent or stone). But this is unclear. Wait, the problem statement says: "Each position on the grid may contain either the agent, a stone or be empty." So a location can have at most one thing. So if the agent is at pos22, then pos22 is not clear. Similarly, if a stone is at pos32, then pos32 is not clear. But in the initial state, under "original state of the world", it says "Location pos22 is clear" and "Location pos32 is clear". That contradicts the agent and stone positions. So perhaps there's a mistake in the problem statement. Alternatively, maybe "clear" refers to being free of stones, but allowing the agent. But that would complicate the movement rules. Hmm, this is confusing. Let me re-examine the problem statement.

In the initial state:

- "player1 is at location pos22"
- "stone1 is at location pos32"
- Then in the list of clear locations, pos22 and pos32 are stated as clear. But according to the definitions, if a location has the agent or a stone, it's not clear. So this must be an error in the problem statement. But perhaps the intended meaning is that "clear" refers to not having a stone, but the agent's presence doesn't affect it. That would make sense for movement, where the agent can move to a location that's clear (no stone), but the agent's own position is not considered for "clear" in that case. Wait, but the "move" action's preconditions state that the target location must be clear. If the agent is moving to a location, then that location must be clear (i.e., no agent or stone there). So if the agent is already at pos22, then pos22 is not clear. But the initial state says "Location pos22 is clear". That's a contradiction. Therefore, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem's initial state description. But maybe the intended setup is that the agent is at pos22, which is not clear, and stone1 is at pos32, which is not clear. But the problem states in the original state that "Location pos22 is clear" and "Location pos32 is clear". So this seems incorrect. However, perhaps the problem uses "clear" to mean that the location is free for movement, i.e., not blocked by a stone. So the agent can occupy a location that is considered clear as long as there's no stone. In that case, when the agent moves, the target location must be clear (no stone). That would make sense. So the initial state's "Location pos22 is clear" is correct because even though the agent is there, the stone is not. So "clear" refers to the presence of a stone. Then, when moving, the target location must be clear (no stone). Then, for the agent to move to a location, that location must not have a stone, but can have the agent? No, because the agent can't be in two places. So maybe "clear" means no agent or stone. But in that case, the initial state is incorrect. Hmm. This is a critical point because it affects the planning steps.

Given the confusion, perhaps the problem has a typo, but we need to proceed with the given information. Let's assume that "clear" means the location has neither agent nor stone. So in the initial state, pos22 has the agent, so it's not clear. But the problem states "Location pos22 is clear", which would be a mistake. However, given that the problem says that, perhaps we need to proceed with that as a given. Alternatively, maybe the problem's initial state lists all the clear locations, and the presence of agent or stones is separate. So the "clear" status is about the presence of stones, and the agent's position is separate. That is, a location is clear if there's no stone there, regardless of the agent's position. So when moving, the agent can move to a location that is clear (no stone) even if the agent is elsewhere. But since the agent can only be in one place, the target location must not have a stone and must not have the agent. But according to the move action's preconditions: (ii) location l_to is clear. So "clear" must mean that l_to is free of both agent and stone.

But in the initial state, the agent is at pos22, and the problem says "Location pos22 is clear". That's impossible if "clear" means no agent or stone. Therefore, this must be a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps "clear" refers to stones only. So a location is clear if there is no stone there. Then, the agent can move to a location even if they are already there (which doesn't make sense). Hmm. This is a problem. Since the problem states that the initial state has player1 at pos22 and pos22 is clear, perhaps "clear" refers to the absence of stones. So the presence of the agent does not affect the clear status. Then, for the move action, the target location must be clear (no stone), and the agent can be there (but since they are moving, they leave their previous location). Wait, but the move action's effect is that the agent is no longer at l_from and is at l_to. So the preconditions for move require that the agent is at l_from and l_to is clear (no stone). So in the initial state, the agent is at pos22, and pos23 is clear (no stone). So the agent can move to pos23 via dirdown, perhaps.

But the main goal is to get stone1 to a goal location. The only goal location mentioned is pos33. So stone1 needs to be at pos33. So the plan must involve pushing stone1 from pos32 to pos33.

To push the stone, the agent needs to be adjacent to the stone and push it in a direction. For example, if the stone is at pos32, the agent can push it to pos33 (if pos33 is clear) by being at pos32 and pushing it down (assuming direction dirdown moves from pos32 to pos33). Wait, the allowed directions: looking at the movement from pos32. The possible directions from pos32 are:

"You may move from location pos32 to location pos22 following direction dirleft"

Wait, no, looking back:

The movement possibilities for pos32:

- "You may move from location pos32 to location pos22 following direction dirleft"
- "You may move from location pos32 to location pos42 following direction dirright"
- "You may move from location pos32 to location pos31 following direction dirup"
- "You may move from location pos32 to location pos33 following direction dirdown"

So direction dirdown from pos32 leads to pos33. So to push the stone from pos32 to pos33 (which is a goal location), the agent needs to be at pos32 (adjacent in the direction opposite to the push direction). Wait, for the push actions, the preconditions require that the agent is at l_p (their current location), the stone is at l_from, and the agent can move from l_p to l_from via direction d. Then, l_from to l_to via the same direction d. So for example, to push the stone from pos32 to pos33 (dirdown), the agent must be at a location l_p that is adjacent to pos32 in the opposite direction. Wait, no: the agent is at l_p, which must be connected to l_from (pos32) via direction d. Then, l_from (pos32) must be connected to l_to (pos33) via direction d. So if the agent is at pos22, and wants to push the stone from pos32 to pos33, direction would be dirright (since from pos22 to pos32 is dirright). Wait, let me check:

The movement from pos22 to pos32 is via direction dirright. So if the agent is at pos22, they can move to pos32 via dirright. But pos32 is occupied by the stone, so they can't move there. So instead, they need to perform a push action. The "pushtogoal" action requires that the agent is at l_p (pos22), the stone is at l_from (pos32), but wait: the l_p must be adjacent to l_from in the direction d. For example, to push the stone from pos32 to pos33 (dirdown), the agent must be at a location l_p that is connected to pos32 via direction dirdown? Or the direction from l_p to l_from is d. Wait, the preconditions for pushtogoal are:

(iv) you can get from l_p to l_from following direction d.

So if the agent is at l_p, which is pos22, and the stone is at l_from (pos32), then direction d must be such that from pos22 to pos32 is possible. Looking at the movement options for pos22: "You may move from location pos22 to location pos32 following direction dirright". So direction dirright. So the agent is at pos22 (l_p), l_from is pos32, and direction d is dirright. Then, from l_from (pos32), moving in direction d (dirright) would go to pos42. But we need to push the stone to pos33, which is direction dirdown from pos32. So this isn't matching. Wait, perhaps the direction for the push is different. Let me think.

The agent needs to be in a position adjacent to the stone such that when they push, the stone moves in the desired direction. For example, to push the stone from pos32 to pos33 (down), the agent needs to be north of the stone (pos32's up is pos22). So the agent is at pos22, and pushes the stone down to pos33. How does that fit into the action parameters?

The action is "pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d".

So l_p is the agent's current location (pos22), l_from is the stone's current location (pos32), l_to is the target location (pos33), and d is the direction from l_p to l_from (which is dirright, since pos22 to pos32 is dirright). Then, the direction from l_from to l_to would be dirdown. Wait, but the direction d in the action is the same for both movements (from l_p to l_from and from l_from to l_to). So the direction must be the same. So if the agent moves from l_p to l_from via direction d, then the stone moves from l_from to l_to via the same direction d. Therefore, for the stone to move down (dirdown) from pos32 to pos33, the agent must approach from the north (pos22) and push down. But the direction from pos22 to pos32 is dirright, not dirdown. So this complicates things.

Wait, no. Let's clarify. The direction d in the action is the same for both the agent moving from l_p to l_from and the stone moving from l_from to l_to. So for the agent to push the stone down (dirdown) into pos33, the agent must be at a position that is north of the stone, i.e., pos22. The movement from pos22 to pos32 is dirright. So the direction d in the action would be dirright, which allows the agent to move from pos22 (l_p) to pos32 (l_from) via dirright. Then, the stone would move from pos32 (l_from) to l_to via the same direction dirright, which would take it to pos42. But we want it to move to pos33. So this isn't possible. Therefore, the direction must be such that moving from l_p to l_from is direction d, and moving from l_from to l_to is also direction d. Therefore, the direction for the push must be the same as the direction the agent approaches the stone.

So in order to push the stone down (to pos33), the agent must be south of the stone? No, because if the agent is south (pos42), then pushing up would move the stone north. Wait, this is getting confusing. Let's think in terms of directions.

The agent must be adjacent to the stone in a direction such that when they push in that direction, the stone moves accordingly. For example, if the agent is to the left of the stone (pos32's left is pos31), then pushing to the right (dirright) would move the stone to pos32's right (pos33). Wait, no. Wait, pos32's right (dirright) would be pos42. Because in the grid, pos32 is in row 3, column 2. Moving right would go to column 3, but wait, the positions are named posXY where X is the row and Y the column. So pos32 is row 3, column 2. Moving right (dirright) would increase the column by 1, so pos33. Wait, no. Wait, looking at the movement options for pos32: "You may move from location pos32 to location pos42 following direction dirright". Wait, that's confusing. So pos32 to pos42 via dirright. That suggests that dirright increases the row number. But that would be moving down. Wait, perhaps the directions are not as intuitive. Let's check the movement options:

For example, pos22 can move to pos32 via dirright. So pos22 is row 2, column 2. pos32 is row 3, column 2. So moving dirright from pos22 takes you down a row. So dirright is south, dirleft is north, dirup is west, dirdown is east? That seems odd, but perhaps the directions are defined that way. Let's see:

From pos22, moving dirright takes you to pos32 (row 3, column 2). So that's down. Moving dirup from pos22 takes you to pos21 (row 2, column 1). Moving dirdown from pos22 takes you to pos23 (row 2, column 3). So direction dirright is down (row increases), dirleft is up (row decreases?), dirup is left (column decreases), dirdown is right (column increases). That's a possible mapping. So directions:

- dirright: down (row +1)
- dirleft: up (row -1)
- dirup: left (column -1)
- dirdown: right (column +1)

So, for example, from pos32 (row3, column2), moving dirright (down) would take to pos42 (row4, column2). Moving dirdown (right) would take to pos33 (row3, column3). Ah, so direction dirdown corresponds to moving right (increasing column), and dirright is moving down (increasing row). This is a bit counterintuitive but important.

So, to push the stone from pos32 to pos33 (which is column3), the direction would be dirdown (right). But the agent needs to be adjacent to the stone in the opposite direction. So to push the stone right (dirdown), the agent must be to the left of the stone (column1). So the agent would be at pos32's left, which is pos31. Because moving from pos31 to pos32 is direction dirdown (right). Wait, no: pos31 to pos32 is direction dirdown according to the movement options. Let's check:

Looking at the movement options for pos31:

"You may move from location pos31 to location pos32 following direction dirdown"

Yes. So pos31 is row3, column1. Moving dirdown (right) to pos32 (row3, column2). Then, from pos32, moving dirdown (right) would go to pos33 (row3, column3).

So to push the stone from pos32 to pos33 (direction dirdown), the agent must be at pos31 (l_p = pos31), and push the stone with direction dirdown. Then, the agent moves from pos31 to pos32 (dirdown), and the stone moves from pos32 to pos33 (dirdown). But in the initial state, the agent is at pos22. So the agent needs to move from pos22 to pos31 to perform this push.

But how can the agent get from pos22 to pos31? Let's plan the path.

From pos22, the movement options are:

- dirleft (up) to pos12
- dirright (down) to pos32 (but pos32 has the stone, so can't move there)
- dirup (left) to pos21
- dirdown (right) to pos23

Wait, the agent is at pos22. To reach pos31, the agent needs to move down (dirright) to pos32, but that's blocked by the stone. Alternatively, move left (dirup) to pos21, then from pos21, what's possible? Let's see:

From pos21, movements:

- dirleft (up) to pos11
- dirright (down) to pos31
- dirdown (right) to pos22

Wait, pos21 can move dirright (down) to pos31. So the path could be:

pos22 → pos21 (dirup), then pos21 → pos31 (dirright). Then the agent is at pos31.

Once at pos31, the agent can perform the pushtogoal action:

pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos32 pos33 dirdown

Because:

(i) agent is at pos31 (l_p)
(ii) stone1 is at pos32 (l_from)
(iii) pos33 (l_to) is clear (initial state says pos33 is clear)
(iv) can move from pos31 to pos32 via dirdown (yes, as per movement options)
(v) can move from pos32 to pos33 via dirdown (yes)
(vi) pos33 is a goal location (yes)

So this action would push the stone from pos32 to pos33, which is the goal.

So the steps would be:

1. Move player1 from pos22 to pos21 (dirup)
2. Move player1 from pos21 to pos31 (dirright)
3. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos32 pos33 dirdown

But wait, after moving to pos31, pos32 has the stone, so when performing the push, the agent is at pos31, stone is at pos32. Then, after the push, the agent moves to pos32 (since in the pushtogoal effect, the agent moves to l_from (pos32)), and the stone moves to pos33. Since pos33 is a goal location, this achieves the goal.

So the plan would be three steps. But maybe there's a shorter way.

Alternatively, can the agent move directly from pos22 to pos32? But pos32 has the stone, so moving there is not possible unless pushing. So the agent must push the stone from pos32 to another location. But the only way to do that is to be adjacent in a direction that allows pushing.

Alternatively, can the agent move around to pos23, then pos33, but pos33 is a goal location but initially clear. Wait, the agent can't move into pos33 if it's clear. Wait, pos33 is clear initially. So agent can move from pos22 to pos23 (dirdown), then from pos23 to pos33 (dirright). But pos33 is a goal location and clear. So:

1. move player1 pos22 pos23 dirdown
2. move player1 pos23 pos33 dirright

But after this, the agent is at pos33, but the stone is still at pos32. Then, the agent needs to go back to pos32 to push the stone. But the stone is at pos32, and the agent is at pos33. To push the stone from pos32 to pos33, the agent would need to be at pos32's opposite direction. For example, pos32's south is pos42. But the agent is at pos33. Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe a longer path. But the first plan of moving to pos31 and pushing seems shorter.

So the steps would be:

Move from pos22 to pos21 (dirup), then pos21 to pos31 (dirright), then push. That's three actions.

Alternatively, can the agent move from pos22 to pos23 (dirdown), then pos23 to pos33 (dirright), then pos33 to pos32 (dirup), but pos32 is occupied by the stone, so can't move there. So that's not possible.

Alternatively, from pos23, can the agent push the stone? If the agent is at pos23, to push the stone at pos32, the direction would need to be such that the agent is adjacent. pos23 is row2, column3. pos32 is row3, column2. They are not adjacent. So no.

Another path: pos22 → pos32 via push, but the agent can't move there directly. So the first plan seems the way to go.

So the optimal plan is three steps:

1. move player1 pos22 pos21 dirup
2. move player1 pos21 pos31 dirright
3. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos32 pos33 dirdown

But wait, after step 2, the agent is at pos31. The stone is at pos32. Then step 3 is the push.

But let's check the preconditions for each action.

Step 1: move from pos22 to pos21 dirup.

Preconditions:

- agent is at pos22 (yes)
- pos21 is clear (initial state says pos21 is clear)
- can move from pos22 to pos21 via dirup. Looking at the movement options for pos22: "You may move from location pos22 to location pos21 following direction dirup" — yes.

Effects: agent leaves pos22, now at pos21. pos22 becomes clear, pos21 is now occupied.

Step 2: move from pos21 to pos31 dirright.

Preconditions:

- agent is at pos21 (yes)
- pos31 is clear (initial state says pos31 is clear)
- can move from pos21 to pos31 via dirright. From pos21's movement options: "You may move from location pos21 to location pos31 following direction dirright" — yes.

Effects: agent leaves pos21, now at pos31. pos21 becomes clear.

Step 3: pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos32 pos33 dirdown.

Check preconditions:

(i) agent is at pos31 (yes)
(ii) stone1 is at pos32 (yes)
(iii) pos33 is clear (yes, initial state says pos33 is clear)
(iv) can get from pos31 to pos32 via dirdown (yes, movement option for pos31: "You may move from location pos31 to location pos32 following direction dirdown")
(v) can get from pos32 to pos33 via dirdown (yes, movement option for pos32: "You may move from location pos32 to location pos33 following direction dirdown")
(vi) pos33 is a goal location (yes)

Effects after pushtogoal:

- agent is no longer at pos31 (now at pos32)
- stone1 is no longer at pos32 (now at pos33)
- pos33 is not clear (now has stone1)
- agent is at pos32
- stone1 is at pos33 (goal achieved)
- pos31 becomes clear (since agent left)
- stone1 is at a goal state.

This satisfies the goal.

So the plan is three actions. Is there a shorter plan?

Wait, can we find a two-step plan? For example, moving directly to pos31 in one move? From pos22 to pos31.

But can the agent move from pos22 to pos31 directly? Looking at the movement options for pos22:

From pos22, possible moves are:

- dirup to pos21
- dirright to pos32 (stone is there, can't move)
- dirleft to pos12
- dirdown to pos23

No direct path to pos31 from pos22. So the path must go through pos21. So two moves to get to pos31.

Then the push action. Total three steps. So this is the minimal plan.
