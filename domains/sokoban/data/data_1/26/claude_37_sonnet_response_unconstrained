Let's organize this information to make it more manageable.

We have a 5x5 grid where:
- player1 is at pos22
- stone1 is at pos32
- The goal is at pos33
- We need to move stone1 to a goal location (pos33)

Now, let's represent the grid:

```
1 2 3 4 5
1 . . . . .
2 . P . . .
3 . S G . .
4 . . . . .
5 . . . . .
```

Where:
- P: player1 at pos22
- S: stone1 at pos32
- G: goal at pos33
- .: empty cell

We need to move the stone to the goal, which is from pos32 to pos33.

The available actions are:
1. move - moves the agent
2. pushtogoal - pushes a stone to a goal location
3. pushtonongoal - pushes a stone to a non-goal location

Let's think about how to move the stone from pos32 to pos33.

We need to push the stone from above (from pos32 to pos33). So, the player needs to be at pos31 to be able to push the stone from pos32 to pos33.

So we need to get the player from pos22 to pos31. Let's trace the moves:

1. Player is at pos22, stone is at pos32.
2. Player moves from pos22 to pos21 (moving up).
3. Player moves from pos21 to pos31 (moving right).
4. Player is now at pos31, and can push the stone from pos32 to pos33 (goal).

So, the plan should be:

1. move player1 pos22 pos21 dirup
2. move player1 pos21 pos31 dirright
3. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos32 pos33 dirdown

Let me check if this matches the format and action requirements:

1. "move p l_from l_to d": Agent p is at location l_from, location l_to should be clear, and you can move from l_from to l_to following direction d.
   - Agent player1 is at pos22, pos21 is clear, and there's a move from pos22 to pos21 in the up direction. Check.

2. "move p l_from l_to d": Agent p is at location l_from, location l_to should be clear, and you can move from l_from to l_to following direction d.
   - After the first move, agent player1 is at pos21, pos31 is clear, and there's a move from pos21 to pos31 in the right direction. Check.

3. "pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": 
   - Agent p is at location l_p: player1 is at pos31. Check.
   - Stone s is at location l_from: stone1 is at pos32. Check.
   - Location l_to is clear: pos33 is clear. Check.
   - You can move from l_p to l_from following direction d: Can move from pos31 to pos32 following dirdown. Check.
   - You can move from l_from to l_to following direction d: Can move from pos32 to pos33 following dirdown. Check.
   - Location l_to is a goal location: pos33 is a goal location. Check.

It seems like our plan is valid. However, there's one thing I want to check. The precondition says:

"Location pos22 is clear"
"Location pos32 is clear"

But that doesn't make sense, as player1 is at pos22 and stone1 is at pos32. Let's double-check the initial state:

"player1 is at location pos22"
"stone1 is at location pos32"
"Location pos22 is clear"
"Location pos32 is clear"

This is contradictory. Let's assume that the objects (player and stone) make their locations "not clear". Then, the initial state should have:

"player1 is at location pos22"
"stone1 is at location pos32"
"Location pos22 is not clear"
"Location pos32 is not clear"

Let me rethink this.

Actually, I think the "Location pos22 is clear" and "Location pos32 is clear" statements might be at the end of the list and intended to be part of some change in the world state. Let's go with the assumption that the player and stone occupy their respective locations, making them "not clear" initially.

Assuming this, our plan should still work:

1. move player1 pos22 pos21 dirup
2. move player1 pos21 pos31 dirright
3. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos32 pos33 dirdown

But let me double-check the effects of our actions to ensure consistency:

1. "move player1 pos22 pos21 dirup": player1 is no longer at pos22, pos21 is no longer clear, player1 is at pos21, pos22 is clear.
2. "move player1 pos21 pos31 dirright": player1 is no longer at pos21, pos31 is no longer clear, player1 is at pos31, pos21 is clear.
3. "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos32 pos33 dirdown": player1 is no longer at pos31, stone1 is no longer at pos32, pos33 is no longer clear, player1 is at pos32, stone1 is at pos33, pos31 is clear, stone1 is at a goal state.

This seems correct. So our plan is:

1. move player1 pos22 pos21 dirup
2. move player1 pos21 pos31 dirright
3. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos32 pos33 dirdown

Let me try to derive an optimal plan. First, let me think about alternative ways to push the stone from pos32 to pos33:

From the left (player at pos31):
- player1 pushes stone1 from pos32 to pos33 (dirdown)

From the right (player at pos33):
- player1 pushes stone1 from pos32 to pos33 (dirdown)
  - But for the player to be at pos33, the stone would already have to be moved elsewhere, which is inefficient.

From above (player at pos22):
- player1 pushes stone1 from pos32 to pos33 (dirdown)
  - But this isn't possible since player1 needs to be at pos31 to push the stone downwards.

From below (player at pos42):
- player1 pushes stone1 from pos32 to pos33 (dirup)
  - player1 needs to move from pos22 to pos42 and then push the stone upwards.

Let's check this route:
1. move player1 pos22 pos32 dirright
   - But stone1 is already at pos32, so this isn't possible.

Alternative route:
1. move player1 pos22 pos23 dirdown
2. move player1 pos23 pos33 dirright
3. move player1 pos33 pos43 dirright
4. move player1 pos43 pos42 dirup
5. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos33 dirup

This seems like 5 steps, which is longer than our first 3-step plan.

Another route:
1. move player1 pos22 pos12 dirleft
2. move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown
3. move player1 pos13 pos23 dirright
4. move player1 pos23 pos33 dirright
5. move player1 pos33 pos43 dirright
6. move player1 pos43 pos42 dirup
7. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos33 dirup

This is even longer.

Another route:
1. move player1 pos22 pos23 dirdown
2. move player1 pos23 pos24 dirdown
3. move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright
4. move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup
5. move player1 pos33 pos32 dirup
6. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos33 pos34 dirdown
7. move player1 pos33 pos32 dirup
8. move player1 pos32 pos31 dirup
9. move player1 pos31 pos41 dirright
10. move player1 pos41 pos42 dirdown
11. move player1 pos42 pos43 dirdown
12. move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft
13. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos34 pos33 dirup

This is much longer and involves moving the stone to a non-goal location first, which is inefficient.

The most efficient plan seems to be our original 3-step plan:

1. move player1 pos22 pos21 dirup
2. move player1 pos21 pos31 dirright
3. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos32 pos33 dirdown

Alright, I believe this is the optimal plan for the problem.

Wait, there's a problem with the statements I was relying on:

"Location pos22 is clear"
"Location pos32 is clear"

Given that we have:
"player1 is at location pos22"
"stone1 is at location pos32"

This seems contradictory. But let me re-examine the original problem:

Under "The original state of the world", we have:
"player1 is at location pos22"
"stone1 is at location pos32"
...
"Location pos22 is clear"
"Location pos32 is clear"

This seems contradictory. A location cannot be both occupied by an agent or stone and also be clear. Let me reconsider my approach.

On further reflection, I think there might be an issue with the initial state. Let's try to interpret it:

If a location is "clear", it means it's empty.
If an agent or stone is at a location, that location is not "clear".

In the initial state, we're told that both pos22 and pos32 are "clear", which suggests they are empty. But we're also told that player1 is at pos22 and stone1 is at pos32, which suggests they are not empty.

This is logically inconsistent.

Since the task is to move stone1 to a goal location (pos33), I'll proceed under the assumption that player1 is indeed at pos22 and stone1 is at pos32, and the seemingly contradictory statements about those locations being "clear" are erroneous.

Actually, I think I'm mixing up the location descriptions and the state descriptions. Let me reread the initial state.

The initial state includes:
"player1 is at location pos22"
"stone1 is at location pos32"

It says "Location pos22 is clear" and "Location pos32 is clear", but these might actually be the results of actions, i.e., they describe the state after something happens. Let me check the effects of actions:

For "move p l_from l_to d", the effects include: "(iv) location l_from is clear."
For "pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d", the effects include: "(vi) location l_p is clear."

So, after the player or stone moves from a location, that location becomes "clear". That makes sense.

Given this understanding, our original 3-step plan seems valid:

1. move player1 pos22 pos21 dirup
2. move player1 pos21 pos31 dirright
3. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos32 pos33 dirdown

But I'm still confused by the statements:
"Location pos22 is clear"
"Location pos32 is clear"

If these are part of the initial state, they contradict the earlier statements that the player and stone are at these locations. But if they are not part of the initial state, why are they listed?

Hmm. Let me rethink. "Location pos22 is clear" and "Location pos32 is clear" could be effects after actions, but they're stated under "The original state of the world", suggesting it's part of the world's initial configuration. This is puzzling.

Actually wait, I think I understand now. The initial state is defined by predicates, and the predicates are not always mutually exclusive. If a location has both "location l is clear" and "object o is at location l", it's just a way of saying that the location is both clear and occupied, which might be a definitional inconsistency but it's how the problem is framed.

For this problem, I should rely on the agent and stone positions as described in the initial state. And in this case, player1 is at pos22 and stone1 is at pos32.

So our original 3-step plan is valid:

1. move player1 pos22 pos21 dirup
2. move player1 pos21 pos31 dirright
3. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos32 pos33 dirdown

After reading the problem again, I'm still not sure why the initial state lists both "player1 is at location pos22" and "Location pos22 is clear". It's contradictory.

Let me check whether the problem is well-defined in other aspects. Actually, the preconditions for move says "location l_to is clear", but for the player to be at location l_from, location l_from should not be clear. Similarly, for pushtogoal, location l_from which has the stone should not be clear. 

So, I think there's a fundamental issue with the problem specification. If we interpret "clear" as "doesn't have an agent or stone", then the initial state contradicts itself. If "clear" has some other interpretation, it's not clear what that is.

Let me reason through this one more time:

1. We're told player1 is at pos22 and stone1 is at pos32.
2. We're also told pos22 and pos32 are "clear".
3. For the move action, a precondition is that l_to should be "clear".

So, if pos22 is "clear", the player could move to pos22. But the player is already at pos22. This doesn't make sense.

Let me approach this differently. Let's say "Location l is clear" is a precondition for an object (agent or stone) to move to that location. And once an object is at a location, the location is no longer clear.

With this interpretation, the initial state can't have both "player1 is at location pos22" and "Location pos22 is clear". So either the player isn't at pos22, or pos22 isn't clear.

But actually, I think the issue might be with how I'm visualizing the actions. Let's look at the effects of the move action:

"After performing this action, (i) agent p is no longer at location l_from, (ii) location l_to is no longer clear, (iii) agent p is at location l_to, and (iv) location l_from is clear."

So, when the agent moves from l_from to l_to, l_from becomes clear (which makes sense) and l_to is no longer clear (which also makes sense as the agent is now there).

I think the statements about pos22 and pos32 being "clear" might be inconsistencies in the problem description.

Let me try to reason again based on the agent and stone positions:

Player1 is at pos22, stone1 is at pos32. Goal is at pos33. We want to push stone1 to the goal.

One way to do this is for player1 to be at pos31, so they can push the stone down from pos32 to pos33.

So our plan is:
1. move player1 pos22 pos21 dirup
2. move player1 pos21 pos31 dirright
3. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos32 pos33 dirdown

This seems like a valid plan to move the stone to the goal.

Another way to push the stone is from below, with player1 at pos42, pushing the stone up from pos32 to pos33.

To get player1 from pos22 to pos42, we could navigate around:
1. move player1 pos22 pos23 dirdown
2. move player1 pos23 pos33 dirright
3. move player1 pos33 pos43 dirright
4. move player1 pos43 pos42 dirup
5. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos33 dirup

This is a 5-step plan, which is longer than our 3-step plan.

Given our objective to provide an optimal plan, i.e., a valid plan with the fewest steps, the best plan seems to be:

1. move player1 pos22 pos21 dirup
2. move player1 pos21 pos31 dirright
3. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos32 pos33 dirdown

Actually, wait, before finalizing, let me check a different approach: can the player move directly to pos31 from pos22?

Checking the possible moves:
"You may move from location pos22 to location pos12 following direction dirleft"
"You may move from location pos22 to location pos32 following direction dirright"
"You may move from location pos22 to location pos21 following direction dirup"
"You may move from location pos22 to location pos23 following direction dirdown"

So, player1 can't move directly from pos22 to pos31. But player1 can move to pos32.

However, stone1 is at pos32, so player1 can't move there unless stone1 is moved first. And to push stone1, player1 needs to be adjacent to stone1 in the direction opposite to the push.

Let's re-evaluate our plan:

1. move player1 pos22 pos21 dirup
2. move player1 pos21 pos31 dirright
3. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos32 pos33 dirdown

This lets the player move to pos31, where they can push the stone to the goal.

I believe this 3-step plan is the most optimal for the problem.

So, our plan is:
```
move player1 pos22 pos21 dirup
move player1 pos21 pos31 dirright
pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos32 pos33 dirdown
```

These are the steps, each in a separate line, which we've delineated with three backticks at the top and bottom.
