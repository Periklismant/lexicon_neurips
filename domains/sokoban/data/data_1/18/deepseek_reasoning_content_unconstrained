Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. So, the goal is to get stone1 to a goal location. From the initial state, stone1 is at pos44, which is not a goal. The only goal location mentioned is pos42. So I need to move stone1 from pos44 to pos42.

First, the agent is at pos53. Let's see the map connections. The movement directions are given, so I need to figure out how the agent can get from pos53 to pos44 to push the stone. 

Looking at the possible moves from pos53: the agent can move to pos43 (dirleft), pos52 (dirup), or pos54 (dirdown). But pos54 is clear. Wait, the initial state says pos44 is clear? Wait, no, the initial state says stone1 is at pos44, so pos44 is not clear. Wait, wait, let me check again. The original state says "stone1 is at location pos44" and "Location pos44 is clear". Wait, that can't be right. If a stone is at a location, that location isn't clear. But according to the original state, "Location pos44 is clear". That's a contradiction. Hmm, maybe I misread. Let me check again.

Looking at the original state:

"stone1 is at location pos44" â€“ so pos44 has stone1.

Then in the list of clear locations: "Location pos44 is clear". Wait, that's conflicting. Because if a stone is there, it shouldn't be clear. But the problem states that each location can have the agent, a stone, or be empty. So if a stone is there, it's not clear. But according to the problem's original state, both are true. That must be an error. Wait, no. Let me check again. The original state lists "Location pos44 is clear" but also "stone1 is at pos44". That's impossible. Unless the problem has a mistake. Or maybe I'm misunderstanding the way the states are represented.

Wait, perhaps the "Location pos44 is clear" is part of the initial state, but since there's a stone there, that's a mistake. But the user provided this as part of the problem. So maybe it's an error in the problem description. But I have to work with the given information. Hmm. Let me check the original state again.

Original state:

- player1 is at pos53.

- stone1 is at pos44.

- Then a list of "Location ... is clear". Among them: "Location pos44 is clear".

But that's conflicting. If stone1 is at pos44, then pos44 is not clear. So perhaps the problem has a typo. But perhaps the user intended that pos44 is not clear (since stone1 is there), but the list says it's clear. That's a problem. But since the problem is given as is, maybe I need to proceed assuming that the initial state is correct. Wait, perhaps the list of "clear" locations is after placing the agent and stones. So, when the agent and stones are placed, their locations are not clear. So the initial state says that stone1 is at pos44, so pos44 is not clear. But in the original state, it's stated as "Location pos44 is clear". So there's a contradiction here. That's confusing.

Alternatively, maybe the "clear" status is for whether the location is free for movement. So if a stone is present, the location is not clear. Therefore, in the initial state, pos44 is occupied by stone1, so it's not clear. But the problem says "Location pos44 is clear", which is incorrect. But this is part of the problem provided. So this might be a mistake. However, perhaps I should proceed under the assumption that the problem's initial state is correct, even if there's a contradiction. Or perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the problem's representation.

Alternatively, maybe the "clear" status refers to whether there's an agent or a stone. So if a stone is present, the location is not clear. So in the initial state, pos44 has a stone, so it's not clear. But the problem states "Location pos44 is clear". That's conflicting. Therefore, this might be an error. But since I need to solve the problem as given, perhaps I should proceed under the assumption that the problem has a typo, and that pos44 is not clear (since the stone is there). But the user input says "Location pos44 is clear". Hmm. That's a problem. Because if pos44 is clear, then there's no stone there. But the stone is at pos44. So perhaps the initial state is wrong. But that's part of the problem given. Maybe it's a mistake in the problem description. But I have to work with what's given. Therefore, perhaps the stone1 is at pos44, but the location is considered clear. That's conflicting, but perhaps the problem allows that. However, according to the problem's preconditions, when you push a stone, the location l_to must be clear. So if the stone is at pos44, then that location is not clear. Therefore, the initial state must have pos44 not clear. But the problem says pos44 is clear. This is conflicting. So maybe it's a mistake. But I have to proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps the "Location pos44 is clear" was a typo, and the intended was that pos44 is not clear. But how to resolve this. Since the problem states both, perhaps I should proceed with the understanding that the presence of the stone at pos44 makes it not clear, regardless of the "clear" statement. Because the presence of objects (agent or stones) makes a location not clear. So the "clear" statements in the initial state might be the initial clear locations before placing the agent and stones. So the agent and stones occupy their locations, making them not clear. Therefore, the correct initial state is:

- pos53 has agent (player1), so not clear.

- pos44 has stone1, so not clear.

But in the original state, it's stated that "Location pos44 is clear", which would be wrong. So perhaps the problem has an error, but as a solver, I have to assume that the presence of the stone overrides the "clear" status. Therefore, pos44 is not clear, even though the problem says it is. Because otherwise, the initial state is inconsistent. Therefore, pos44 is occupied by stone1, hence not clear.

Given that, the agent needs to get to a position adjacent to pos44 to push the stone to the goal pos42. Let's see the possible paths.

The stone is at pos44. The goal is pos42. So the stone needs to move from pos44 to pos42. To push the stone, the agent must be at a position adjacent to pos44 in the direction from which the push can occur. Looking at the movement directions for pos44:

The allowed moves from pos44 are:

- To pos34 (dirleft)

- To pos54 (dirright) [but according to the problem's movement directions: "You may move from location pos44 to location pos54 following direction dirright"? Wait, no, looking at the problem's movement list:

Looking for "pos44" in the movement directions:

- "You may move from location pos34 to location pos44 following direction dirright"

- "You may move from location pos44 to location pos34 following direction dirleft"

- "You may move from location pos44 to location pos54 following direction dirright"

Wait, the movement directions:

From pos44, possible movements are:

- dirleft: to pos34 (since moving left from pos44 would be to the left column? Wait, the grid is probably numbered as rows and columns. Let's assume pos11 is row 1, column 1. pos12 is row1, column2. pos21 is row2, column1. So moving down would increase the row number. So pos44 is row4, column4. Then, moving dirright would be to column5, so pos45? Wait, but according to the movement directions, from pos44, moving dirright is to pos54? That's confusing. Wait, let me check the movement directions again.

Looking at the movement list:

- "You may move from location pos44 to location pos34 following direction dirleft"

- "You may move from location pos44 to location pos54 following direction dirright"

- "You may move from location pos44 to location pos43 following direction dirup"

- "You may move from location pos44 to location pos45 following direction dirdown"

Wait, no. Wait, in the movement list provided by the problem, looking for pos44:

Looking for lines that start with "You may move from location pos44 ...":

I found:

"You may move from location pos34 to location pos44 following direction dirright"

"You may move from location pos44 to location pos34 following direction dirleft"

"You may move from location pos44 to location pos54 following direction dirright"

"You may move from location pos44 to location pos43 following direction dirup"

"You may move from location pos44 to location pos45 following direction dirdown"

So from pos44, possible directions:

- dirleft: to pos34 (since pos34 is column3, row4? Wait, maybe the positions are arranged such that the first digit is the row and the second the column. So pos44 is row4, column4. Then:

- dirleft would decrease the column by 1: pos43.

Wait, but according to the movement direction, moving from pos44 to pos34 via dirleft. Wait, pos34 is row3, column4. So dirleft from pos44 would be column4-1=3, so pos43. But according to the movement list, moving dirleft from pos44 takes you to pos34. That's conflicting. Hmm. Maybe the directions are not as straightforward. The directions might be based on a grid where movement in certain directions corresponds to specific row and column changes. For example, dirup might decrease the row, dirdown increases the row, dirleft decreases column, dirright increases column. Let me check some examples.

For example, the movement from pos11 to pos21 is following direction dirright. So pos11 is row1, column1. dirright would increase column to 2, but pos21 is row2, column1. Wait, that doesn't fit. So maybe the directions are not aligned with columns and rows. Alternatively, maybe the grid is arranged such that moving dirright from pos11 leads to pos12, but according to the movement list, pos11 can move to pos21 (dirright) or pos12 (dirdown). So perhaps dirright is moving to the next row, and dirdown is moving to the next column? That seems odd. Let's check:

From pos11:

- move dirright to pos21.

- move dirdown to pos12.

So dirright increases the row number by 1, while dirdown increases the column number by 1. So dirright is moving down the rows, and dirdown is moving right in columns. Then, dirleft would decrease the row number, and dirup would decrease the column number. That's a possible way to interpret it. So direction dirright is along the row axis (changing the row), and dirdown is along the column axis. So for example, pos44:

- dirleft would be row3, column4 (pos34).

- dirright would be row5, column4 (pos54).

- dirup would be row4, column3 (pos43).

- dirdown would be row4, column5 (pos45).

So when the agent is at pos44, moving dirleft would take them to pos34 (row3, column4), dirright to pos54 (row5, column4), dirup to pos43 (row4, column3), and dirdown to pos45 (row4, column5).

But the goal location is pos42. So the agent needs to push the stone from pos44 to pos42. How?

pos42 is row4, column2. So from pos44 (row4, column4), to get to pos42, the stone would need to move left two columns. But pushing a stone requires the agent to be adjacent in the direction of the push. For example, to push the stone from pos44 to pos43 (dirup direction, which is column3), the agent must be at pos44's dirup direction, which is pos43. Wait, no. Wait, the directions are a bit confusing here. Let's clarify.

To push the stone from pos44 to pos43, the agent must be at pos44's adjacent location in the direction opposite to the push. Wait, according to the action preconditions for pushtogoal or pushtonongoal: 

For example, "pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": 

Precondition (iv) you can get from location l_p to l_from following direction d. So l_p is the agent's current location, and l_from is the stone's current location. So the direction d must be such that moving from l_p to l_from is possible via direction d. Then, direction d is the direction from l_p to l_from.

Wait, the movement from l_p to l_from is via direction d. Then, to push the stone from l_from to l_to, you need to move in direction d again. So the agent is at l_p, moves in direction d to l_from (the stone's location), and then pushes the stone in direction d to l_to.

So for example, if the agent is at pos43 (which is row4, column3), and the stone is at pos44 (row4, column4), then the agent can push the stone to pos45 (dirdown direction from pos44) if the movement from pos43 to pos44 is allowed in direction d. Wait, looking at the movement directions from pos43:

Looking for movement from pos43. The movement directions for pos43 include:

"You may move from location pos43 to location pos33 following direction dirleft" (dirleft is row3, column3)

"You may move from location pos43 to location pos53 following direction dirright" (dirright to pos53, row5, column3)

"You may move from location pos43 to location pos42 following direction dirup" (dirup would be column2, so pos42: row4, column2?)

Wait, this is getting too confusing. Let me try to map the grid.

Assuming the first digit is the row and the second the column. So pos11 is row1, column1; pos12 is row1, column2; pos21 is row2, column1; etc.

Then, directions:

- dirup: decreases the column number by 1? Because from pos43 (row4, column3), moving dirup goes to pos42 (row4, column2). So dirup decreases column by 1.

- dirdown: increases column by 1. So from pos43, dirdown would go to pos44 (row4, column4).

- dirleft: decreases row by 1. From pos43 (row4), dirleft would go to pos33 (row3, column3).

- dirright: increases row by 1. From pos43, dirright would go to pos53 (row5, column3).

So, in this case, directions dirup/dirdown affect the column, dirleft/dirright affect the row. That's a possible layout. So movement in dirup from pos43 (row4, column3) would take you to pos42 (row4, column2), since column decreases by 1. Dirdown would take you to pos44 (column4). Dirleft to pos33 (row3, column3), dirright to pos53 (row5, column3).

If that's the case, then pushing the stone from pos44 to pos42 would require the agent to be in a position adjacent to pos44 in a direction that allows pushing towards pos42.

Wait, pos44 is row4, column4. pos42 is row4, column2. So to get from pos44 to pos42, you need to move left two columns. But pushing a stone can only move it one step at a time. So the stone would need to be pushed from pos44 to pos43 (column3), then from pos43 to pos42 (column2). Each push requires the agent to be adjacent in the direction of the push.

So first, the agent needs to get to pos44's west (dirup direction) to push it west (dirup) to pos43. Then, from pos43, push it west again to pos42.

Wait, but pos42 is a goal location. So the first push would be to pos43 (non-goal), then the second push to pos42 (goal). But how can the agent reach pos44's adjacent positions?

The stone is at pos44. The agent starts at pos53. So the agent needs to navigate to a position adjacent to pos44 to push it.

Let's map the path from pos53 to pos44's adjacent positions.

pos53 is row5, column3. The agent is here. The stone is at pos44 (row4, column4). The agent needs to reach, say, pos43 (row4, column3) to push the stone west (dirup) to pos43 (wait, noâ€”if the agent is at pos43 (row4, column3), the stone is at pos44 (row4, column4). To push the stone west (dirup) to pos43 (column3?), wait, no. If the stone is at pos44 (row4, column4), and the agent is at pos43 (row4, column3), then the direction from pos43 to pos44 would be dirdown (since moving from pos43 to pos44 is column4, so dirdown increases column by 1. So the agent is at pos43, direction dirdown to pos44. Then, pushing the stone in direction dirdown would move it to pos45 (column5). But we need to push it west (column3 to 2). So maybe the agent needs to be at pos34 (row3, column4) to push the stone north (dirleft) to pos34. Wait, this is getting complicated.

Alternative approach: The agent needs to reach a position adjacent to the stone (pos44) such that pushing the stone in the direction towards pos42.

pos42 is row4, column2. So from pos44 (row4, column4), the path to pos42 is two steps west (columns 4 â†’3 â†’2). So each step requires pushing the stone west (dirup direction).

First, push the stone from pos44 to pos43 (column3), then from pos43 to pos42 (column2).

To push the stone from pos44 to pos43, the agent must be at pos44's east (dirright?), but noâ€”Wait, to push the stone west (dirup), the agent needs to be on the east side of the stone (so the direction from the agent to the stone is west (dirleft?), but this depends on the movement directions.

Alternatively, the agent must be at a position that allows moving in direction d to reach the stone's current location (l_from). Then, the stone is pushed in direction d to l_to.

So for the first push from pos44 to pos43, the agent must be at a location l_p such that moving from l_p to pos44 via direction d is possible, and then the stone moves in direction d to pos43. Wait, but moving from l_p to pos44 via direction d, then the stone moves in the same direction d to pos43. That would mean that d is the direction from l_p to pos44, and then the stone is pushed in direction d to pos43. So for example, if the agent is at pos45 (row4, column5), moving direction dirleft (which would decrease row by 1? Or column by 1? Earlier confusion arises again.

Alternatively, perhaps the agent needs to be at pos54 (row5, column4), direction dirleft (which would take to pos44), and then push the stone dirleft to pos43. Wait, but pos54 to pos44 is dirleft (if dirleft decreases the row number). pos54 is row5, column4. dirleft would decrease row to 4, so pos44. Then, pushing dirleft again would take the stone to pos34 (row3, column4). Not helpful.

Alternatively, the agent is at pos43 (row4, column3). From pos43, moving dirdown (column increases by 1) to pos44. Then, pushing dirdown would take the stone to pos45. Not helpful.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's look at the allowed movements for the agent to reach the stone's location.

The agent is at pos53 (row5, column3). The stone is at pos44 (row4, column4). The goal is pos42 (row4, column2).

The agent needs to navigate to a position adjacent to the stone to push it. Let's see possible paths from pos53 to pos44's adjacent positions.

Possible adjacent positions to pos44 are:

- pos34 (row3, column4) â€“ north

- pos54 (row5, column4) â€“ south

- pos43 (row4, column3) â€“ west

- pos45 (row4, column5) â€“ east

Wait, based on earlier movement directions, from pos44:

- dirleft takes to pos34 (row3, column4)

- dirright takes to pos54 (row5, column4)

- dirup takes to pos43 (row4, column3)

- dirdown takes to pos45 (row4, column5)

So the agent needs to reach one of these positions to push the stone.

To push the stone towards pos42 (row4, column2), the agent needs to push it west (dirup) from pos44 to pos43, then from pos43 to pos42. So first, push from pos44 to pos43, which requires the agent to be east of pos44 (pos45), and push west (dirleft?), but that depends on direction.

Alternatively, the agent can push the stone west from pos44 by being at pos44's east side (pos45) and pushing west. But according to the movement directions, from pos45 you can't directly reach pos44. Let's check the movement directions for pos45:

Looking at movement from pos45:

"You may move from location pos45 to location pos35 following direction dirleft" (dirleft would be row3, column5)

"You may move from location pos45 to location pos55 following direction dirright" (row5, column5)

"You may move from location pos45 to location pos44 following direction dirup" (dirup would decrease column from 5 to 4, so pos44 is row4, column4. Yes, moving dirup from pos45 (row4, column5) would decrease column to 4, so pos44.

So, if the agent is at pos45, they can move dirup to pos44. Then, pushing the stone dirup (west) to pos43. Wait, no. Because when the agent is at pos45, moving dirup to pos44, then pushing in the same direction (dirup) would take the stone to pos43. So that's possible.

Wait, no. Let's clarify the directions again. If the agent is at pos45 (row4, column5), moving dirup (which decreases the column by 1) to pos44 (row4, column4). Then, pushing the stone in dirup direction would take it to pos43 (row4, column3). That's correct.

So, the plan could be:

1. Move the agent from pos53 to pos45, then push the stone from pos44 to pos43 (using pushtonongoal, since pos43 is not a goal), then push from pos43 to pos42 (pushtogoal, since pos42 is a goal).

But how to get the agent to pos45.

Current agent location: pos53 (row5, column3).

Path to pos45 (row4, column5):

From pos53, possible movements:

pos53 can move to pos43 (dirleft), pos52 (dirup), pos54 (dirdown).

Let's see:

pos53 â†’ pos43 (dirleft): row5-1=4, column3. So pos43 is row4, column3. Then from pos43, possible moves.

From pos43, movement directions:

You can move to pos33 (dirleft), pos53 (dirright), pos42 (dirup), pos44 (dirdown).

So from pos43, the agent can move dirdown to pos44 (but pos44 has the stone, so it's not clear. Wait, pos44 is occupied by the stone, so the agent can't move there unless it's clear. But pos44 is not clear (stone is there), so moving to pos44 is not possible. So the agent can't move from pos43 to pos44.

Alternatively, from pos43, the agent can move dirup to pos42 (row4, column2). But pos42 is a goal location and is clear. So pos42 is clear, so the agent can move there.

But let's think about the path to pos45.

Alternative path:

From pos53, move to pos54 (dirdown). pos54 is row5, column4.

From pos54, can move to pos44 (dirleft) or pos53 (dirup), or pos55 (dirdown).

But pos44 is occupied by the stone, so the agent can't move there.

Alternatively, from pos53, move to pos54 (dirdown), then to pos55 (dirdown), then to pos45 (dirleft? From pos55, can move to pos45 (dirleft: row5-1=4, column5. pos45 is row4, column5. So dirleft from pos55 (row5, column5) would be pos45 (row4, column5). Yes, the movement direction says: "You may move from location pos55 to location pos45 following direction dirleft".

So path: pos53 â†’ pos54 (dirdown) â†’ pos55 (dirdown) â†’ pos45 (dirleft).

Then, from pos45, the agent can perform a pushtonongoal action to push the stone from pos44 to pos43.

Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos45 pos44 pos43 dirup.

Because:

- Agent is at pos45 (l_p = pos45).

- Stone is at pos44 (l_from = pos44).

- l_to is pos43.

- direction d is dirup, since moving from pos45 to pos44 is dirup (from pos45, moving dirup to pos44).

Then, after pushing, the agent moves to pos44 (since the effect of pushtonongoal is that agent moves to l_from (pos44), and the stone moves to pos43. But wait, the effect of pushtonongoal is:

(i) agent p is no longer at l_p (pos45)

(ii) stone s is no longer at l_from (pos44)

(iii) l_to (pos43) is no longer clear

(iv) agent p is at l_from (pos44)

(v) stone s is at l_to (pos43)

(vi) l_p (pos45) is clear

So after this action, the agent is at pos44, and the stone is at pos43.

Then, the next step is to push the stone from pos43 to pos42 (which is a goal). For that, the agent must be adjacent to pos43 in the direction towards pos42.

pos43 is row4, column3. pos42 is row4, column2. So direction from pos43 to pos42 is dirup (column decreases by 1). So the agent needs to be east of pos43 (pos44) to push it west.

But after the first push, the agent is at pos44. To push the stone from pos43 to pos42, the agent needs to be at pos43's east (pos44) and move west (dirup) to pos43, then push dirup to pos42.

Wait, the agent is currently at pos44. To push the stone at pos43, the agent needs to move to a position adjacent to pos43 in the direction opposite to the push.

The stone is at pos43. To push it west (dirup) to pos42, the agent must be east of pos43 (pos44) and move west (dirup) to pos43, then push in dirup direction.

So the agent can move from pos44 to pos43 via dirup. Wait, pos44 to pos43 is dirup (since column decreases by 1). But is that allowed? Looking at movement directions from pos44:

"You may move from location pos44 to location pos43 following direction dirup". Yes. So the agent can move from pos44 to pos43 via dirup.

But pos43 currently has the stone. So after the first push, the stone is at pos43. Therefore, pos43 is not clear. So the agent can't move there. Therefore, the agent can't move from pos44 to pos43 directly.

Alternative approach: After the first push, the agent is at pos44. The stone is at pos43. The agent needs to get to a position adjacent to pos43 to push it further west to pos42.

Possible positions adjacent to pos43:

- pos33 (dirleft from pos43: row3, column3)

- pos53 (dirright: row5, column3)

- pos42 (dirup: row4, column2)

- pos44 (dirdown: row4, column4)

The agent is at pos44. To reach a position adjacent to pos43, perhaps the agent can move from pos44 to pos34 (dirleft), then to pos33 (dirleft), then to pos43 (dirright)? Not sure.

Alternatively, the agent can move from pos44 to pos34 (dirleft), then to pos33 (dirleft), but that's getting away from the stone.

Alternatively, agent at pos44 can move to pos54 (dirright), then to pos55 (dirdown), then to pos45 (dirleft), but that's a long path.

Alternatively, after the first push, the agent is at pos44. The stone is at pos43. The agent needs to move around to pos43's east (pos44) to push the stone west. But pos43 is occupied by the stone, so the agent can't be there. So the agent is at pos44, which is adjacent to pos43 (dirdown from pos43 is pos44). Wait, pos43 and pos44 are adjacent via dirdown/ dirup.

Wait, pos43 is row4, column3. pos44 is row4, column4. So they are adjacent in the east-west direction. So to push the stone from pos43 to pos42 (west), the agent needs to be east of pos43 (at pos44) and push west (dirup).

So the agent is already at pos44. Can the agent perform a pushtogoal action from pos44 to push the stone from pos43 to pos42.

Wait, the preconditions for pushtogoal are:

- agent p is at l_p (pos44)

- stone s is at l_from (pos43)

- l_to is clear (pos42)

- can move from l_p (pos44) to l_from (pos43) via direction d. What direction is from pos44 to pos43? dirup (column decreases by 1). So direction d is dirup.

- can move from l_from (pos43) to l_to (pos42) via direction d (dirup). pos43 to pos42 is dirup (column 3 to 2).

- l_to is a goal location (pos42 is a goal).

So yes, the agent can perform pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos43 pos42 dirup.

This would push the stone from pos43 to pos42, which is the goal.

So the plan would be:

1. Move agent from pos53 to pos45 via pos54, pos55.

2. Push the stone from pos44 to pos43 using pushtonongoal.

3. Push the stone from pos43 to pos42 using pushtogoal.

But the first step requires moving from pos53 to pos45. Let's detail the moves:

Action 1: move player1 pos53 pos54 dirdown

Action 2: move player1 pos54 pos55 dirdown

Action 3: move player1 pos55 pos45 dirleft

Action 4: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos45 pos44 pos43 dirup

Action 5: pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos43 pos42 dirup

Wait, after action 4, the agent is at pos44. Then, for action 5, the agent is at pos44, and the stone is at pos43. So the preconditions for action 5 are:

- agent is at pos44 (yes)

- stone is at pos43 (yes)

- pos42 is clear (yes, initially pos42 is a goal location and is clear unless something is there. After the first push, pos43 is occupied by the stone, but pos42 is still clear.

- can move from pos44 to pos43 via dirup (yes, as per movement directions)

- can move from pos43 to pos42 via dirup (yes)

- pos42 is a goal (yes)

So action 5 is valid.

Thus, the plan has 5 actions. But maybe there's a shorter path.

Alternative path: Can the agent reach pos45 faster?

From pos53, possible moves:

pos53 â†’ pos54 (dirdown)

pos54 â†’ pos55 (dirdown)

pos55 â†’ pos45 (dirleft)

That's three moves. Then, push the stone from pos44 to pos43 (action4), then push to pos42 (action5). Total of 5 actions.

Is there a shorter path? Let's see:

Alternative route from pos53 to pos45:

pos53 â†’ pos54 (dirdown)

pos54 â†’ pos44 (dirleft) â†’ but pos44 is occupied by the stone, so cannot move there.

Alternatively, pos53 â†’ pos43 (dirleft)

pos43 â†’ pos42 (dirup)

pos42 â†’ pos32 (dirup) â†’ but this seems to move away.

Alternatively, pos53 â†’ pos43 (dirleft)

From pos43, can the agent move to pos44 (dirdown)? But pos44 has the stone, so it's not clear. So no.

Hmm. So the shortest path to pos45 is via pos54, pos55, pos45, which takes 3 move actions. Then two push actions. Total of 5 actions.

Is there a way to reduce this?

What if the agent takes a different path to pos45. For example:

pos53 â†’ pos52 (dirup)

pos52 â†’ pos42 (dirleft) â†’ since pos52 is row5, column2. dirleft would decrease row to 4, column2 â†’ pos42. But pos42 is clear, so possible.

pos42 â†’ pos43 (dirdown). Because pos42 is row4, column2. dirdown increases column to 3 â†’ pos43. But pos43 is currently clear (before any actions), except after pushing the stone there.

Wait, initial state: pos43 is clear. So agent can move there.

Wait, initial stone is at pos44, so pos44 is not clear. Other locations are clear.

So from pos53, agent can:

pos53 â†’ pos52 (dirup)

pos52 â†’ pos42 (dirleft) â†’ as per movement directions: "You may move from location pos52 to location pos42 following direction dirleft"

Then, pos42 â†’ pos43 (dirdown). From pos42, movement directions: "You may move from location pos42 to location pos43 following direction dirdown"

So that's three moves to reach pos43. Then, can the agent push the stone from pos44 to pos43?

But to do that, the agent needs to be at pos45 to push dirup to pos44, but if the agent is at pos43, can they push the stone?

Wait, the stone is at pos44. Agent at pos43 can push the stone east (dirdown) to pos45. But that's the opposite direction of where we need to go. So that's not helpful.

Alternatively, agent at pos43 can push the stone north (dirleft) to pos34, but that's not helpful.

Hmm. This path leads the agent to pos43, but then can't push the stone towards pos42.

So the initial plan of moving via pos54, pos55, pos45 is better.

Another alternative: agent moves from pos53 to pos43 (dirleft). Then, from pos43, move to pos33 (dirleft). Then to pos34 (dirright). Then to pos44 (dirright). But pos44 is occupied by the stone, so can't move there.

No, this is not helpful.

So the shortest path seems to be 3 moves to pos45, then two pushes. Total of 5 actions.

Is there a way to push the stone in fewer steps? Let's think.

If the agent can push the stone directly from pos44 to pos42 in one action, but that's not possible because they are two steps apart. Each push action can only move the stone one tile.

Therefore, two pushes are needed. And the agent needs to get into position to perform those pushes. The minimal number of moves is likely three to get to pos45, then two pushes. So total of five actions.

Now, checking if all preconditions are met for each action.

Action 1: move player1 pos53 pos54 dirdown.

Preconditions:

- agent is at pos53 (yes).

- pos54 is clear (original state: pos54 is clear).

- movement from pos53 to pos54 via dirdown is allowed. Looking at movement directions: "You may move from location pos53 to location pos54 following direction dirdown" â€“ yes.

So valid.

Action 2: move player1 pos54 pos55 dirdown.

Preconditions:

- agent at pos54.

- pos55 clear? Original state: pos55 is clear.

- movement from pos54 to pos55 via dirdown is allowed. Check movement directions: "You may move from location pos54 to location pos55 following direction dirdown" â€“ yes.

Valid.

Action3: move player1 pos55 pos45 dirleft.

Preconditions:

- agent at pos55.

- pos45 clear? Original state: pos45 is clear.

- movement from pos55 to pos45 via dirleft is allowed. Movement directions: "You may move from location pos55 to location pos45 following direction dirleft" â€“ yes.

Valid.

Action4: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos45 pos44 pos43 dirup.

Preconditions:

- agent at pos45 (yes after action3).

- stone1 at pos44 (yes).

- pos43 clear (yes, initially clear).

- can move from pos45 to pos44 via dirup. Movement direction: "You may move from location pos45 to location pos44 following direction dirup" â€“ yes.

- can move from pos44 to pos43 via dirup. Movement direction: "You may move from location pos44 to location pos43 following direction dirup" â€“ yes.

- pos43 is not a goal (yes, since pos43 is not a goal location).

Valid.

After this action:

- Agent is now at pos44.

- Stone is at pos43.

- pos45 is clear.

Action5: pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos43 pos42 dirup.

Preconditions:

- agent at pos44 (yes).

- stone at pos43 (yes).

- pos42 clear (yes, initially clear and after Action4, pos42 is still clear).

- can move from pos44 to pos43 via dirup. Movement direction: "You may move from location pos44 to location pos43 following direction dirup" â€“ yes.

- can move from pos43 to pos42 via dirup. Movement direction: "You may move from location pos43 to location pos42 following direction dirup" â€“ yes.

- pos42 is a goal location (yes).

Valid.

After this action:

- Stone is at pos42 (goal location).

This achieves the goal. The plan has 5 actions. Are there any shorter plans?

Alternative approach: Can the agent push the stone from pos44 to pos34 (north), then push west to pos33, then south to pos43, etc.? That would take more steps, so not optimal.

Alternatively, after moving to pos45 and pushing to pos43, can the agent push directly to pos42 without moving? Yes, as in the plan above. So the plan is optimal with 5 actions.

Another check: Are there any shorter paths for the agent's movement?

For example, from pos53 to pos55 via pos54, but that's already considered. Or is there a direct path from pos53 to pos45?

pos53 (row5, column3) to pos45 (row4, column5). Possible moves would require moving right (dirright) to increase row, but the movement from pos53 is possible to pos54 (dirdown), which is row5, column4. Then to pos55 (dirdown), row5, column5. Then dirleft to pos45. That's three moves. No shorter path exists.

Thus, the plan is optimal with 5 actions.
