In this problem:
1. We have a 2D grid with locations like pos11, pos12, etc.
2. There's an agent (player1) at position pos53.
3. There's a stone (stone1) at position pos44.
4. There's a goal location at position pos42.
5. We need to move stone1 to a goal position.

Let's visualize the grid to better understand the problem:

```
   1  2  3  4  5
1 [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]
2 [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]
3 [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]
4 [ ][G][ ][S][ ]
5 [ ][ ][P][ ][ ]
```

Where:
- G is a goal position (pos42)
- S is a stone (pos44)
- P is the player (pos53)

We need to move the stone to the goal, which is from pos44 to pos42. This requires pushing the stone left twice. To do this, we need to be to the right of the stone, which means we need to move to pos54.

Let's plan:

1. Move player1 from pos53 to pos54 (down direction)
2. Push stone1 from pos44 to pos43 (left direction)
3. Push stone1 from pos43 to pos42 (left direction)

Let's check if our movements satisfy the action preconditions:

For the first move:
- "move p l_from l_to d": Can I move player1 from pos53 to pos54 in the down direction?
  - player1 is at pos53 ✓
  - pos54 is clear ✓
  - Can go from pos53 to pos54 following dirup ✓
  
Wait, I think the direction is confusing. Let's understand what up, down, left, and right mean in this grid:

From "You may move from location pos53 to location pos54 following direction dirdown", it seems that dirdown is moving from pos53 to pos54, which means going from row 5, column 3 to row 5, column 4.

Let's reinterpret the directions:
- dirdown: Increase the column number (move right)
- dirup: Decrease the column number (move left)
- dirright: Increase the row number (move down)
- dirleft: Decrease the row number (move up)

Actually, that doesn't seem right either. Let's try to deduce the correct directions from the provided list of allowed movements. 

For example: "You may move from location pos53 to location pos54 following direction dirdown" means going from (5,3) to (5,4), which is moving to the right. However, the action is labeled as "dirdown".

Let's check another example: "You may move from location pos53 to location pos43 following direction dirleft" means going from (5,3) to (4,3), which is moving up. But the action is labeled as "dirleft".

Hmm, this is confusing. Let me revisit some of the allowed movements:

"You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright" means going from (1,1) to (2,1), which is moving right. And the action is labeled "dirright".

"You may move from location pos11 to location pos12 following direction dirdown" means going from (1,1) to (1,2), which is moving down. And the action is labeled "dirdown".

Ok, based on these examples, let's reinterpret the directions again:
- dirdown: Increase the second digit (move down)
- dirup: Decrease the second digit (move up)
- dirright: Increase the first digit (move right)
- dirleft: Decrease the first digit (move left)

With this interpretation, the grid would be:

```
   1  2  3  4  5
1 [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]
2 [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]
3 [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]
4 [ ][G][ ][S][ ]
5 [ ][ ][P][ ][ ]
```

And the directions would be:
- Up means moving from, say, pos53 to pos43 (decreasing the second digit)
- Down means moving from, say, pos43 to pos53 (increasing the second digit)
- Left means moving from, say, pos53 to pos43 (decreasing the first digit)
- Right means moving from, say, pos23 to pos33 (increasing the first digit)

But this contradicts the information in the allowed movements! Let me try again.

"You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright" means going from (1,1) to (2,1). If we consider that pos11 represents row 1, column 1, then pos21 would be row 2, column 1. So, dirright increases the row.

"You may move from location pos11 to location pos12 following direction dirdown" means going from (1,1) to (1,2). If pos11 is row 1, column 1, then pos12 would be row 1, column 2. So, dirdown increases the column.

Let's reestablish the grid based on this understanding:

```
   1  2  3  4  5
1 [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]
2 [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]
3 [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]
4 [ ][G][ ][S][ ]
5 [ ][ ][P][ ][ ]
```

The first digit is the row (vertical), and the second digit is the column (horizontal).

With this understanding:
- dirright means increasing the row (moving down in the visualization)
- dirleft means decreasing the row (moving up in the visualization)
- dirdown means increasing the column (moving right in the visualization)
- dirup means decreasing the column (moving left in the visualization)

Great, now I have a clear understanding of the directions.

So, the plan would be:

1. Move player1 from pos53 to pos54 following dirdown.
2. Move player1 from pos54 to pos44 following dirleft.
3. Move player1 from pos44 to pos43 following dirup.
4. Push stone1 from pos44 to pos43 (pushing from the right).
5. Push stone1 from pos43 to pos42 (pushing from the right).

Actually, I need to correct this plan, because from state description player1 is at position pos53 and stone1 is at position pos44. So the original plan doesn't make sense.

Let's re-plan:

1. Player1 is at pos53 and stone1 is at pos44. In order to push the stone, player1 needs to be adjacent to the stone. 
2. Player1 needs to be to the right of stone1 to push it to the left, towards the goal position pos42.
3. To get to the right of stone1, player1 needs to move to pos54.
4. From pos54, player1 can push stone1 from pos44 to pos43.
5. From pos43, player1 can push stone1 from pos43 to pos42 (the goal position).

Let's now check if the plan meets the preconditions:

1. "move player1 pos53 pos54 dirdown": 
   - player1 is at pos53 ✓
   - pos54 is clear ✓
   - you can get from pos53 to pos54 following dirdown ✓ (based on "You may move from location pos53 to location pos54 following direction dirdown" in the original state)

Actually, wait a minute. The relation in my grid doesn't seem right.

I think the first index is the row and the second index is the column. So:
- pos53 is at row 5, column 3
- pos44 is at row 4, column 4

That's why the information states "You may move from location pos53 to location pos54 following direction dirdown" (move right) and "You may move from location pos53 to location pos43 following direction dirleft" (move up).

Let's visualize the grid once more to be sure:

```
   1  2  3  4  5
1 [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]
2 [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]
3 [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]
4 [ ][G][ ][S][ ]
5 [ ][ ][P][ ][ ]
```

Where:
- pos11 is at the top-left
- P (player1) is at pos53 (row 5, column 3)
- S (stone1) is at pos44 (row 4, column 4)
- G (goal) is at pos42 (row 4, column 2)

The available directions are:
- dirdown: Increase the column (move right)
- dirup: Decrease the column (move left)
- dirright: Increase the row (move down)
- dirleft: Decrease the row (move up)

Now, let's plan again:

1. Move player1 from pos53 to pos43 following dirleft.
2. Move player1 from pos43 to pos44 following dirdown.
3. Push stone1 from pos44 to pos43 using the pushtonongoal action.
4. Push stone1 from pos43 to pos42 using the pushtogoal action.

Let's break down each step to make sure it adheres to the action preconditions:

1. "move player1 pos53 pos43 dirleft":
   - player1 is at pos53 ✓
   - pos43 is clear ✓
   - you can get from pos53 to pos43 following dirleft ✓ (based on "You may move from location pos53 to location pos43 following direction dirleft" in the original state)

2. "move player1 pos43 pos44 dirdown":
   - player1 is at pos43 ✓ (after step 1)
   - pos44 is not clear × (since stone1 is at pos44)

Oops, I made a mistake. I can't simply move to pos44 because there's a stone there.

Let's rethink this:
1. The goal is to get the stone (at pos44) to the goal position (pos42).
2. To move the stone to the left (towards the goal), I need to be to the right of the stone.
3. But player1 is at pos53, which is below and to the left of the stone.

I need to find a way to get to the right of the stone at pos44 without passing through its position. Let's try to go around:

1. Move player1 from pos53 to pos54 following dirdown.
2. Move player1 from pos54 to pos44 following dirleft.

But there's a problem: I can't move to pos44 because the stone is there. I need to push the stone from a different direction first.

Let's see if I can push the stone down:

1. Move player1 from pos53 to pos43 following dirleft.
2. Push stone1 from pos44 to pos54 using pushtonongoal (pushing down).
3. Move player1 from pos43 to pos53 following dirright.
4. Move player1 from pos53 to pos54 following dirdown.
5. Push stone1 from pos54 to pos53 using pushtonongoal (pushing left).
6. Move player1 from pos53 to pos43 following dirleft.
7. Move player1 from pos43 to pos53 following dirright.
8. Move player1 from pos53 to pos52 following dirup.
9. Move player1 from pos52 to pos42 following dirleft.
10. Move player1 from pos42 to pos43 following dirdown.
11. Move player1 from pos43 to pos53 following dirright.
12. Push stone1 from pos53 to pos43 using pushtonongoal (pushing up).
13. Push stone1 from pos43 to pos42 using pushtogoal (pushing left).

Let's check each step:

1. "move player1 pos53 pos43 dirleft":
   - player1 is at pos53 ✓
   - pos43 is clear ✓
   - you can get from pos53 to pos43 following dirleft ✓

2. "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos44 pos54 dirdown":
   - player1 is at pos43 ✓ (after step 1)
   - stone1 is at pos44 ✓
   - pos54 is clear ✓
   - you can get from pos43 to pos44 following dirdown ✓
   - you can get from pos44 to pos54 following dirdown ✓
   - pos54 is not a goal location ✓

Wait... I'm missing something here. "pushtonongoal" action expects:

```
pushtonongoal p s l_p l_from l_to d
```

Where:
- p: Player
- s: Stone
- l_p: Current location of player
- l_from: Current location of stone
- l_to: Target location for stone
- d: Direction

But the player1 is at pos43 and the stone is at pos44. The direction from pos43 to pos44 is dirdown, but the direction from pos44 to pos54 is dirright, not dirdown. So, I'm a bit confused about the direction parameter.

Let's check the preconditions of pushtonongoal again:

```
"pushtonongoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": You may only perform this action if (i) agent p is at location l_p, (ii) stone s is at location l_from, (iii) location l_to is clear, (iv) you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d, (v) you can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d, and (vi) location l_to is not a goal location.
```

The fourth precondition says that I should be able to get from the player's location to the stone's location using direction d. Similarly, the fifth precondition says I should be able to get from the stone's location to the target location using the same direction d.

So, for the player at pos43, the stone at pos44, and the target at pos54, the direction should be dirdown for both. Let's check if this is possible:

- Can I get from pos43 to pos44 using dirdown? Yes, "You may move from location pos43 to location pos44 following direction dirdown" is in the original state.
- Can I get from pos44 to pos54 using dirdown? No, I don't see such a relation in the original state. The only way to move from pos44 to pos54 is using dirright, not dirdown.

I'm mixing up directions. dirdown means moving to the right, so from pos44 to pos54 would be using the direction dirdown.

Let's double-check:
From "You may move from location pos44 to location pos54 following direction dirright" in the original state, I understand that to move from pos44 to pos54, I should use dirright.

I was indeed mixing up the directional meanings.
- dirdown: Increase the second digit (move right horizontally)
- dirup: Decrease the second digit (move left horizontally)
- dirright: Increase the first digit (move down vertically)
- dirleft: Decrease the first digit (move up vertically)

Wait, this is confusing. Let me check the original state again:

"You may move from location pos44 to location pos54 following direction dirright" means from (4,4) to (5,4) using dirright. So dirright means increasing the first digit, which is moving down in our grid.

"You may move from location pos44 to location pos45 following direction dirdown" means from (4,4) to (4,5) using dirdown. So dirdown means increasing the second digit, which is moving right in our grid.

So my understanding is correct:
- dirdown: Increase the second digit (move right horizontally)
- dirup: Decrease the second digit (move left horizontally)
- dirright: Increase the first digit (move down vertically)
- dirleft: Decrease the first digit (move up vertically)

Now, for the push action, I need to use the correct direction. For the player at pos43, the stone at pos44, and the target at pos54, the direction for the push is dirright, not dirdown.

Let's redo this:

1. "move player1 pos53 pos43 dirleft":
   - player1 is at pos53 ✓
   - pos43 is clear ✓
   - you can get from pos53 to pos43 following dirleft ✓

2. "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos44 pos54 dirright":
   - player1 is at pos43 ✓ (after step 1)
   - stone1 is at pos44 ✓
   - pos54 is clear ✓
   - you can get from pos43 to pos44 following dirdown ✓
   - you can get from pos44 to pos54 following dirright ✓
   - pos54 is not a goal location ✓

But the action requires that you can get from pos43 to pos44 and from pos44 to pos54 using the same direction. This isn't the case here.

I think I might be misinterpreting the action. Let's try to understand it differently. The direction d in the push action might refer to the general direction of the push, not necessarily the specific movement from one position to another.

In the context of this action, I think the direction d should be such that I can move from the player's location to the stone's location in the direction of the push. And then, the stone moves in the same direction from its current position to the target.

So, for the player at pos43, the stone at pos44, and the target at pos54, the direction of the push would be dirright (since I'm pushing the stone down from pos44 to pos54).

Now, let's check the action:

2. "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos44 pos54 dirright":
   - player1 is at pos43 ✓ (after step 1)
   - stone1 is at pos44 ✓
   - pos54 is clear ✓
   - you can get from pos43 to pos44 using dirdown, not dirright (the direction from pos43 to pos44 is dirdown, not dirright)
   
Let's check the exact preconditions for the pushtogoal and pushtonongoal actions once more:

```
"pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": You may only perform this action if (i) agent p is at location l_p, (ii) stone s is at location l_from, (iii) location l_to is clear, (iv) you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d, (v) you can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d, and (vi) location l_to is a goal location.
```

```
"pushtonongoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": You may only perform this action if (i) agent p is at location l_p, (ii) stone s is at location l_from, (iii) location l_to is clear, (iv) you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d, (v) you can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d, and (vi) location l_to is not a goal location.
```

The confusion arises from the fact that precondition (iv) and (v) both use the same direction d.

So, for the player at pos43, the stone at pos44, and the target at pos54, there isn't a single direction d such that I can get from pos43 to pos44 and from pos44 to pos54 using that same direction.

Let's take a step back and think about this problem again. I need to get the stone to pos42 (the goal location). From it's current position at pos44, it needs to move left twice.

To push the stone left, I need to be to the right of it. So I need to get to position pos45 and then push the stone left.

Here's a plan:
1. Move player1 from pos53 to pos54 using dirdown.
2. Move player1 from pos54 to pos55 using dirdown.
3. Move player1 from pos55 to pos45 using dirleft.
4. Move player1 from pos45 to pos44 using dirup.
5. Push stone1 from pos44 to pos43 using pushtonongoal and direction dirup.
6. Push stone1 from pos43 to pos42 using pushtogoal and direction dirup.

Let's check each step:

1. "move player1 pos53 pos54 dirdown":
   - player1 is at pos53 ✓
   - pos54 is clear ✓
   - you can get from pos53 to pos54 following dirdown ✓

2. "move player1 pos54 pos55 dirdown":
   - player1 is at pos54 ✓ (after step 1)
   - pos55 is clear ✓
   - you can get from pos54 to pos55 following dirdown ✓

3. "move player1 pos55 pos45 dirleft":
   - player1 is at pos55 ✓ (after step 2)
   - pos45 is clear ✓
   - you can get from pos55 to pos45 following dirleft ✓

4. "move player1 pos45 pos44 dirup":
   - player1 is at pos45 ✓ (after step 3)
   - pos44 is not clear × (since stone1 is at pos44)

Oops, I made a mistake. I can't simply move to pos44 because there's a stone there.

I need to go around. Let's see:

1. Move player1 from pos53 to pos54 using dirdown.
2. Move player1 from pos54 to pos44 using dirleft.

Oh, but the second step doesn't work because there's a stone at pos44.

Let me try once more:

1. Move player1 from pos53 to pos43 using dirleft. (Going up)
2. Now, to push the stone left (towards the goal), I need to be to the right of it.
   So, I need to move from pos43 to pos45, going around the stone.
3. Move player1 from pos43 to pos33 using dirleft.
4. Move player1 from pos33 to pos34 using dirdown.
5. Move player1 from pos34 to pos35 using dirdown.
6. Move player1 from pos35 to pos45 using dirright.
7. Move player1 from pos45 to pos44 using dirup. (Now I'm to the right of the stone)
8. Push stone1 from pos44 to pos43 using pushtonongoal and direction dirup. (Pushing the stone left)
9. Push stone1 from pos43 to pos42 using pushtogoal and direction dirup. (Pushing the stone left again to the goal)

Actually, I've realized I've been making a crucial mistake in my plan. The stone is not at pos44 because my grid is wrong.

If we designate positions as "pos<row><column>", then:
- pos53 means row 5, column 3, which is correct for player1's position.
- pos44 means row 4, column 4. If the stone is here, then we need to push it to the left to get to pos42.

I think my grid and plan are correct.

Now, let me check the plan more carefully:

1. "move player1 pos53 pos43 dirleft":
   - player1 is at pos53 ✓
   - pos43 is clear ✓
   - you can get from pos53 to pos43 following dirleft ✓

2. "move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft":
   - player1 is at pos43 ✓ (after step 1)
   - pos33 is clear ✓
   - you can get from pos43 to pos33 following dirleft ✓

3. "move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown":
   - player1 is at pos33 ✓ (after step 2)
   - pos34 is clear ✓
   - you can get from pos33 to pos34 following dirdown ✓

4. "move player1 pos34 pos35 dirdown":
   - player1 is at pos34 ✓ (after step 3)
   - pos35 is clear ✓
   - you can get from pos34 to pos35 following dirdown ✓

5. "move player1 pos35 pos45 dirright":
   - player1 is at pos35 ✓ (after step 4)
   - pos45 is clear ✓
   - you can get from pos35 to pos45 following dirright ✓

Now, here's the tricky part. Can I push the stone from pos45? I need to check the preconditions again:

"pushtonongoal p s l_p l_from l_to d":
1. Agent p is at location l_p. ✓ (player1 is at pos45)
2. Stone s is at location l_from. ✓ (stone1 is at pos44)
3. Location l_to is clear. ✓ (pos43 is clear)
4. You can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d.
5. You can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d.
6. Location l_to is not a goal location. ✓ (pos43 is not a goal location)

For (4) and (5), I need to determine the direction d.
Can I get from pos45 to pos44 using some direction d? And can I then use the same direction d to get from pos44 to pos43?

From pos45 to pos44, I can move using dirup (which means moving to the left).
From pos44 to pos43, I can also move using dirup.

So, direction d should be dirup.

6. "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos45 pos44 pos43 dirup":
   - player1 is at pos45 ✓ (after step 5)
   - stone1 is at pos44 ✓
   - pos43 is clear ✓
   - you can get from pos45 to pos44 following dirup ✓
   - you can get from pos44 to pos43 following dirup ✓
   - pos43 is not a goal location ✓

After this action, player1 would be at pos44 and stone1 would be at pos43.

7. "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos43 pos42 dirup":
   - player1 is at pos44 ✓ (after step 6)
   - stone1 is at pos43 ✓ (after step 6)
   - pos42 is clear ✓
   - you can get from pos44 to pos43 following dirup ✓
   - you can get from pos43 to pos42 following dirup ✓
   - pos42 is a goal location ✓

So, my plan seems to be correct. Let me list it once more for clarity:

1. "move player1 pos53 pos43 dirleft"
2. "move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft"
3. "move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown"
4. "move player1 pos34 pos35 dirdown"
5. "move player1 pos35 pos45 dirright"
6. "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos45 pos44 pos43 dirup"
7. "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos43 pos42 dirup"

This plan satisfies all the preconditions for all actions, so it should bring about the desired situation: "stone1 is at a goal location."

Now, let's double-check if the plan is optimal. We need to move the stone from pos44 to pos42, which is a distance of 2. To push the stone, we need to be behind it in the direction we want to push. That means we need to be to the right of the stone to push it left. So, we need to get to pos45 from pos53.

The shortest way to get from pos53 to pos45 would be:
1. "move player1 pos53 pos54 dirdown"
2. "move player1 pos54 pos55 dirdown"
3. "move player1 pos55 pos45 dirleft"

But, as I pointed out, this plan doesn't work because after step 3, I can't move directly to pos44 because there's a stone there.

Therefore, I need to go around, as in my original plan. Looking at the path, there doesn't appear to be a shorter way from pos53 to pos45 without passing through pos44.

Let's check again if there's a more direct path:

The path from pos53 to pos45 without going through pos44 includes:
1. Go from pos53 to pos43 (up).
2. Go from pos43 to pos33 (up).
3. Go from pos33 to pos34 (right).
4. Go from pos34 to pos35 (right).
5. Go from pos35 to pos45 (down).

That's 5 moves. Is there a shorter path?

I could try going down and right:
1. Go from pos53 to pos54 (right).
2. Go from pos54 to pos55 (right).
3. Go from pos55 to pos45 (up).

That's only 3 moves. This seems shorter. But, as I said, it doesn't work because after getting to pos45, the stone is at pos44, and I want to push it. But to push it, I need to be in the same position, which I can't be.

Wait, I'm getting confused again. Let's clarify the preconditions for the push actions:

"pushtonongoal p s l_p l_from l_to d" preconditions:
(i) agent p is at location l_p,
(ii) stone s is at location l_from,
(iii) location l_to is clear,
(iv) you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d,
(v) you can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d,
(vi) location l_to is not a goal location.

So, for me to push the stone from pos44 to pos43, I need to be in a position such that I can move to pos44 using a specific direction, and that same direction will also take the stone from pos44 to pos43.

From pos45, I can go to pos44 using dirup. From pos44, I can go to pos43 using dirup as well.
So, the action would be: "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos45 pos44 pos43 dirup".

Similarly, to push the stone from pos43 to pos42, I need to be in a position such that I can move to pos43 using a specific direction, and that same direction will also take the stone from pos43 to pos42.

From pos44, I can go to pos43 using dirup. From pos43, I can go to pos42 using dirup as well.
So, the action would be: "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos43 pos42 dirup".

This matches my original plan. I believe the plan is optimal, considering the constraints of the game.

Alright, here's the optimal plan:
1. "move player1 pos53 pos43 dirleft"
2. "move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft"
3. "move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown"
4. "move player1 pos34 pos35 dirdown"
5. "move player1 pos35 pos45 dirright"
6. "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos45 pos44 pos43 dirup"
7. "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos43 pos42 dirup"

Before I conclude, let me check for any other possible paths or optimizations.

Actually, there's another path from pos53 to pos45:
1. Go from pos53 to pos52 (left).
2. Go from pos52 to pos42 (up).
3. Go from pos42 to pos32 (up).
4. Go from pos32 to pos33 (right).
5. Go from pos33 to pos34 (right).
6. Go from pos34 to pos35 (right).
7. Go from pos35 to pos45 (down).

But that's 7 moves, which is even longer than the previous 5-move path.

And another path:
1. Go from pos53 to pos43 (up).
2. Go from pos43 to pos33 (up).
3. Go from pos33 to pos23 (up).
4. Go from pos23 to pos24 (right).
5. Go from pos24 to pos25 (right).
6. Go from pos25 to pos35 (down).
7. Go from pos35 to pos45 (down).

But that's 7 moves as well.

I've checked various paths, and the 5-move path (pos53 -> pos43 -> pos33 -> pos34 -> pos35 -> pos45) seems to be the shortest.

So, the optimal plan I've established is:
1. "move player1 pos53 pos43 dirleft"
2. "move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft"
3. "move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown"
4. "move player1 pos34 pos35 dirdown"
5. "move player1 pos35 pos45 dirright"
6. "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos45 pos44 pos43 dirup"
7. "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos43 pos42 dirup"

But wait a second, in step 6 I am pushing from (4,5) to (4,4) to (4,3) which are all on the same row. If dirup means moving left (decreasing column index), then the direction for this pushing action could be confusing.

Let's clarify:
- From pos45, if I move in the dirup direction, I would be at pos44. So dirup is the direction from pos45 to pos44.
- Similarly, from pos44, if I move in the dirup direction, I would be at pos43. So dirup is the direction from pos44 to pos43.

This is why I chose dirup for the first push action.

Similarly for step 7:
- From pos44, if I move in the dirup direction, I would be at pos43. So dirup is the direction from pos44 to pos43.
- From pos43, if I move in the dirup direction, I would be at pos42. So dirup is the direction from pos43 to pos42.

This is why I chose dirup for the second push action.

Just to double-check, let me verify the directional meanings one more time:
- dirdown: Increase the column number (move right)
- dirup: Decrease the column number (move left)
- dirright: Increase the row number (move down)
- dirleft: Decrease the row number (move up)

So, indeed, dirup is the direction I should use for both push actions. So my plan seems to be correct and optimal.

The one thing I'm unclear about is the specific name of the action. The problem statement provides:
```
"pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d":
"pushtonongoal p s l_p l_from l_to d":
```

But it doesn't say how these action names translate into the output. I will assume the action names are as given:

1. "move player1 pos53 pos43 dirleft"
2. "move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft"
3. "move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown"
4. "move player1 pos34 pos35 dirdown"
5. "move player1 pos35 pos45 dirright"
6. "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos45 pos44 pos43 dirup"
7. "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos43 pos42 dirup"
