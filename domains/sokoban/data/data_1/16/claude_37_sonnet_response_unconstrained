Alright, so let me understand the problem:

1. We have a 2D square grid represented as positions like `pos11`, `pos12`, etc., where the first digit is the row and the second is the column.
2. There's an agent (`player1`) and a stone (`stone1`).
3. The goal is to move the stone to a goal location, and the only goal location in the grid is `pos43`.

To formulate a plan, I need to:
1. Move the agent to a position adjacent to the stone.
2. Push the stone to the goal location.

Currently:
- The agent (`player1`) is at `pos11`.
- The stone (`stone1`) is at `pos24`.
- The goal location is `pos43`.

Since the agent and stone are at different positions, I'll first move the agent adjacent to the stone. Then, I'll use the stone-pushing actions to push the stone to the goal location.

First, I need to figure out how to get from `pos11` to a position adjacent to `pos24`.

I can move from:
- `pos11` to `pos21` using `dirright`
- `pos11` to `pos12` using `dirdown`

I'll go to `pos21` and then work my way to a position adjacent to `pos24`.

From `pos21`, I can go to:
- `pos31` using `dirright`
- `pos22` using `dirdown`

I'll go to `pos22`.

From `pos22`, I can go to:
- `pos23` using `dirdown`

And from `pos23`, I can go to:
- `pos24` using `dirdown`

Wait, but I can't go to `pos24` directly, as it's occupied by the stone. I need to be adjacent to it to push it. So, I should be at `pos23`.

Now, let's trace the plan:
1. Move from `pos11` to `pos21` using `dirright`.
2. Move from `pos21` to `pos22` using `dirdown`.
3. Move from `pos22` to `pos23` using `dirdown`.

That's one way to get from `pos11` to a position adjacent to `pos24`. Now, I need to push the stone from `pos24` to `pos43`.

Let's see the path from `pos24` to `pos43`:
- From `pos24`, I can push it to `pos34` using `dirright`.
- From `pos34`, I can push it to `pos33` using `dirup`.
- From `pos33`, I can push it to `pos43` using `dirright`.

But there's a complication. Pushing involves the agent being on one side of the stone and pushing it to the other side. 

So, to push the stone from `pos24` to `pos34` using `dirright`, the agent should be at `pos14`. But I just moved the agent to `pos23`. To push from that position, I'd be using `dirdown` to move the stone from `pos24` to `pos25`. But that's not in the direction of the goal.

Let me rethink this. After I get to `pos23`, I need to move to `pos14` to push the stone to the right.

From `pos23`, I can go to:
- `pos13` using `dirleft`

From `pos13`, I can go to:
- `pos14` using `dirdown`

So now I'll be at `pos14`, which means I'm positioned left of the stone, and I can push it to the right.

Plan so far:
1. Move from `pos11` to `pos21` using `dirright`.
2. Move from `pos21` to `pos22` using `dirdown`.
3. Move from `pos22` to `pos23` using `dirdown`.
4. Move from `pos23` to `pos13` using `dirleft`.
5. Move from `pos13` to `pos14` using `dirdown`.
6. Push the stone from `pos24` to `pos34` using `dirright`.

After I push the stone to `pos34`, I need to reposition the agent to push the stone up to `pos33`. To do this, I need to be at `pos35`.

From `pos24` (where I'll be after pushing the stone), I can go to:
- `pos25` using `dirdown`

From `pos25`, I can go to:
- `pos35` using `dirright`

Then, I can push the stone from `pos34` to `pos33` using `dirup`.

Plan so far:
1. Move from `pos11` to `pos21` using `dirright`.
2. Move from `pos21` to `pos22` using `dirdown`.
3. Move from `pos22` to `pos23` using `dirdown`.
4. Move from `pos23` to `pos13` using `dirleft`.
5. Move from `pos13` to `pos14` using `dirdown`.
6. Push the stone from `pos24` to `pos34` using `dirright`.
7. Move from `pos24` to `pos25` using `dirdown`.
8. Move from `pos25` to `pos35` using `dirright`.
9. Push the stone from `pos34` to `pos33` using `dirup`.

After I push the stone to `pos33`, I need to reposition the agent to push the stone to the right to `pos43`. To do this, I need to be at `pos23`.

From `pos34` (where I'll be after pushing the stone), I can go to:
- `pos24` using `dirleft`

From `pos24`, I can go to:
- `pos23` using `dirup`

Then, I can push the stone from `pos33` to `pos43` using `dirright`.

Plan so far:
1. Move from `pos11` to `pos21` using `dirright`.
2. Move from `pos21` to `pos22` using `dirdown`.
3. Move from `pos22` to `pos23` using `dirdown`.
4. Move from `pos23` to `pos13` using `dirleft`.
5. Move from `pos13` to `pos14` using `dirdown`.
6. Push the stone from `pos24` to `pos34` using `dirright`. (Actually, I'll use the action "pushtonongoal" since `pos34` is not a goal location.)
7. Move from `pos24` to `pos25` using `dirdown`.
8. Move from `pos25` to `pos35` using `dirright`.
9. Push the stone from `pos34` to `pos33` using `dirup`. (I'll use "pushtonongoal" since `pos33` is not a goal location.)
10. Move from `pos34` to `pos24` using `dirleft`.
11. Move from `pos24` to `pos23` using `dirup`.
12. Push the stone from `pos33` to `pos43` using `dirright`. (I'll use "pushtogoal" since `pos43` is a goal location.)

Let me double-check this plan:

The initial state says:
- The agent (`player1`) is at `pos11`.
- The stone (`stone1`) is at `pos24`.
- The goal location is `pos43`.

Final state after the plan:
- The stone (`stone1`) is at `pos43`, which is a goal location.

The plan moves the stone from `pos24` to `pos43` via `pos34` and `pos33`. The agent repositions itself when necessary to push the stone in the desired direction.

But there's a tiny issue. When I checked the initial state, it says "Location pos11 is clear" and "Location pos24 is clear", but I thought the agent is at `pos11` and the stone is at `pos24`. Let me re-read the initial state:

- "player1 is at location pos11"
- "stone1 is at location pos24"
- "Location pos12 is clear"
...
- "Location pos55 is clear"
- "pos43 is a goal location"
...

Oh, I see the issue. The initial state is saying both "player1 is at location pos11" and "Location pos11 is clear". This is contradictory. Let me reread the problem:

Actually, I see the issue. The last two facts of the initial state contradict the first two:
- "Location pos11 is clear" (contradicts "player1 is at location pos11")
- "Location pos24 is clear" (contradicts "stone1 is at location pos24")

I think these last two facts may be erroneous, as it doesn't make sense for a location to be both occupied and clear. But I'll go with the assumption that the agent is at `pos11` and the stone is at `pos24`, and these last two facts are errors.

Let's finalize the plan:

1. Move from `pos11` to `pos21` using `dirright`: "move player1 pos11 pos21 dirright"
2. Move from `pos21` to `pos22` using `dirdown`: "move player1 pos21 pos22 dirdown"
3. Move from `pos22` to `pos23` using `dirdown`: "move player1 pos22 pos23 dirdown"
4. Move from `pos23` to `pos13` using `dirleft`: "move player1 pos23 pos13 dirleft"
5. Move from `pos13` to `pos14` using `dirdown`: "move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown"
6. Push the stone from `pos24` to `pos34` using `dirright`: "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos14 pos24 pos34 dirright"
7. Move from `pos24` to `pos25` using `dirdown`: "move player1 pos24 pos25 dirdown"
8. Move from `pos25` to `pos35` using `dirright`: "move player1 pos25 pos35 dirright"
9. Push the stone from `pos34` to `pos33` using `dirup`: "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos35 pos34 pos33 dirup"
10. Move from `pos34` to `pos24` using `dirleft`: "move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft"
11. Move from `pos24` to `pos23` using `dirup`: "move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup"
12. Push the stone from `pos33` to `pos43` using `dirright`: "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos33 pos43 dirright"

Actually, I realized I need to be more careful about the directions. Let me check the given directions:
- `dirdown` seems to increase the first digit of the position (move down in a grid).
- `dirleft` seems to decrease the second digit of the position (move left in a grid).
- `dirright` seems to increase the second digit of the position (move right in a grid).
- `dirup` seems to decrease the first digit of the position (move up in a grid).

But let me double-check by looking at the allowed moves:
- "You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright"
- "You may move from location pos11 to location pos12 following direction dirdown"

This suggests:
- `dirright` increases the first digit (moves from row 1 to row 2).
- `dirdown` increases the second digit (moves from column 1 to column 2).

This is confusing. Let me check more:
- "You may move from location pos12 to location pos22 following direction dirright"
- "You may move from location pos12 to location pos11 following direction dirup"
- "You may move from location pos12 to location pos13 following direction dirdown"

Alright, so:
- `dirright` takes you from `posAB` to `pos(A+1)B`. (Move to the right in the grid, which means row increases (rows are the first digit))
- `dirleft` takes you from `posAB` to `pos(A-1)B`. (Move to the left in the grid, which means row decreases)
- `dirdown` takes you from `posAB` to `posA(B+1)`. (Move down in the grid, which means column increases (columns are the second digit))
- `dirup` takes you from `posAB` to `posA(B-1)`. (Move up in the grid, which means column decreases)

Ok, so all the directions seem to be given from a "birds-eye view" of the grid where the rows (first digit) increase from left to right, and columns (second digit) increase from top to bottom. 

This means my initial understanding was incorrect. Let me revise based on the correct understanding:

I need to get from `pos11` to a position adjacent to `pos24`.

Let's redraw the grid for clarity:
```
    1   2   3   4   5  (column)
  +---+---+---+---+---+
1 | A |   |   |   |   |
  +---+---+---+---+---+
2 |   |   |   | S |   |
  +---+---+---+---+---+
3 |   |   |   |   |   |
  +---+---+---+---+---+
4 |   |   | G |   |   |
  +---+---+---+---+---+
5 |   |   |   |   |   |
  +---+---+---+---+---+
  (row)
```

Where A is the agent, S is the stone, and G is the goal.

From this, I can see:
- The agent needs to move from `pos11` to get to a position adjacent to `pos24`.
- The agent can push the stone in any of the four directions to eventually get it to `pos43`.

Let's plan the agent's path to get adjacent to the stone:
1. Move from `pos11` to `pos21` using `dirright`.
2. Move from `pos21` to `pos31` using `dirright`.
3. Move from `pos31` to `pos32` using `dirdown`.
4. Move from `pos32` to `pos33` using `dirdown`.
5. Move from `pos33` to `pos34` using `dirdown`.
6. Move from `pos34` to `pos24` using `dirleft`.

Wait, but I can't go to `pos24` directly as it's occupied by the stone. I need to be adjacent to it, so I should stop at step 5 and be at `pos34`.

Now, I'm at `pos34`, which is below the stone at `pos24`. I can push the stone up to `pos14` (using `dirleft`).

Actually, I think there are many ways to get to a position adjacent to the stone. Let's see:

To get from `pos11` to `pos14` (to push the stone from the left):
1. Move from `pos11` to `pos12` using `dirdown`.
2. Move from `pos12` to `pos13` using `dirdown`.
3. Move from `pos13` to `pos14` using `dirdown`.

To get from `pos11` to `pos23` (to push the stone from the top):
1. Move from `pos11` to `pos21` using `dirright`.
2. Move from `pos21` to `pos22` using `dirdown`.
3. Move from `pos22` to `pos23` using `dirdown`.

To get from `pos11` to `pos25` (to push the stone from the bottom):
1. Move from `pos11` to `pos21` using `dirright`.
2. Move from `pos21` to `pos22` using `dirdown`.
3. Move from `pos22` to `pos23` using `dirdown`.
4. Move from `pos23` to `pos24` using `dirdown`.
5. Move from `pos24` to `pos25` using `dirdown`.

Wait, this isn't right. I can't go to `pos24` as it's occupied. Let me rethink. 

Let me use another approach. Let's look at the direct path for the stone to get to the goal:
- From `pos24` to `pos34` using `dirright` (moving right).
- From `pos34` to `pos43` using `dirdown` (moving down).

This means the agent needs to:
1. Get to a position where it can push the stone to the right, which is `pos14` (directly to the left of the stone).
2. After pushing, get to a position where it can push the stone down, which would be `pos33` (directly above the stone at its new position at `pos34`).

Let's plan this:

To get from `pos11` to `pos14` (to push the stone from the left):
1. Move from `pos11` to `pos12` using `dirdown`.
2. Move from `pos12` to `pos13` using `dirdown`.
3. Move from `pos13` to `pos14` using `dirdown`.

Push the stone to the right:
4. Push the stone from `pos24` to `pos34` using `dirright`: "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos14 pos24 pos34 dirright"

To get from `pos24` (where the agent will be after pushing) to `pos33` (to push the stone down):
5. Move from `pos24` to `pos23` using `dirup`.
6. Move from `pos23` to `pos33` using `dirright`.

Push the stone down:
7. Push the stone from `pos34` to `pos43` using `dirdown`: "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos34 pos43 dirdown"

So the final plan is:
1. Move from `pos11` to `pos12` using `dirdown`: "move player1 pos11 pos12 dirdown"
2. Move from `pos12` to `pos13` using `dirdown`: "move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown"
3. Move from `pos13` to `pos14` using `dirdown`: "move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown"
4. Push the stone from `pos24` to `pos34` using `dirright`: "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos14 pos24 pos34 dirright"
5. Move from `pos24` to `pos23` using `dirup`: "move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup"
6. Move from `pos23` to `pos33` using `dirright`: "move player1 pos23 pos33 dirright"
7. Push the stone from `pos34` to `pos43` using `dirdown`: "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos34 pos43 dirdown"

Let me check this again:

Grid at start:
```
    1   2   3   4   5  (column)
  +---+---+---+---+---+
1 | A |   |   |   |   |
  +---+---+---+---+---+
2 |   |   |   | S |   |
  +---+---+---+---+---+
3 |   |   |   |   |   |
  +---+---+---+---+---+
4 |   |   | G |   |   |
  +---+---+---+---+---+
5 |   |   |   |   |   |
  +---+---+---+---+---+
  (row)
```

Step 1: Move down to `pos12`.
```
    1   2   3   4   5
  +---+---+---+---+---+
1 |   |   |   |   |   |

4 |   |   | G |   |   |
  +---+---+---+---+---+
5 |   |   |   |   |   |
  +---+---+---+---+---+
```

Step 2: Move down to `pos13`.
```
    1   2   3   4   5
  +---+---+---+---+---+

4 |   |   | G |   |   |
  +---+---+---+---+---+
5 |   |   |   |   |   |
  +---+---+---+---+---+
```

Step 3: Move down to `pos14`.
```
    1   2   3   4   5
  +---+---+---+---+---+
1 |   |   |   |   |   |
  +---+---+---+---+---+
2 |   |   |   | S |   |
  +---+---+---+---+---+
3 |   |   |   |   |   |
  +---+---+---+---+---+
4 | A |   | G |   |   |
  +---+---+---+---+---+
5 |   |   |   |   |   |
  +---+---+---+---+---+
```

Step 4: Push the stone to `pos34`.
```
    1   2   3   4   5
  +---+---+---+---+---+
1 |   |   |   |   |   |
  +---+---+---+---+---+
2 |   |   |   |   |   |
  +---+---+---+---+---+
3 |   |   |   | S |   |
  +---+---+---+---+---+
4 |   |   | G | A |   |
  +---+---+---+---+---+
5 |   |   |   |   |   |
  +---+---+---+---+---+
```

Wait, this doesn't look right. After pushing the stone right, the agent should move to where the stone was, so the agent should be at `pos24`.

Let me restart with a clearer understanding of the actions and their effects:

When the agent pushes a stone, the stone moves one cell in the direction of the push, and the agent takes the position previously occupied by the stone.

Given this, let's replan:

To get from `pos11` to `pos14` (to push the stone from the left):
1. Move from `pos11` to `pos12` using `dirdown`: "move player1 pos11 pos12 dirdown"
2. Move from `pos12` to `pos13` using `dirdown`: "move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown"
3. Move from `pos13` to `pos14` using `dirdown`: "move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown"

Push the stone to the right:
4. Push the stone from `pos24` to `pos34` using `dirright`: "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos14 pos24 pos34 dirright"

After this, the agent is at `pos24` and the stone is at `pos34`.

Looking at the path to the goal, the most direct route is to push the stone down from `pos34` to `pos43`. To do this, the agent needs to be directly above the stone, which means at `pos33`.

To get from `pos24` to `pos33`:
5. Move from `pos24` to `pos23` using `dirup`: "move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup"
6. Move from `pos23` to `pos33` using `dirright`: "move player1 pos23 pos33 dirright"

Push the stone down:
7. Push the stone from `pos34` to `pos43` using `dirdown`: "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos34 pos43 dirdown"

So the final plan is:
1. "move player1 pos11 pos12 dirdown"
2. "move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown"
3. "move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown"
4. "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos14 pos24 pos34 dirright"
5. "move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup"
6. "move player1 pos23 pos33 dirright"
7. "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos34 pos43 dirdown"

Let me trace through this plan step by step to ensure it's correct:

Start:
- Agent is at `pos11`.
- Stone is at `pos24`.
- Goal is at `pos43`.

After step 1:
- Agent is at `pos12`.
- Stone is at `pos24`.

After step 2:
- Agent is at `pos13`.
- Stone is at `pos24`.

After step 3:
- Agent is at `pos14`.
- Stone is at `pos24`.

After step 4:
- Agent is at `pos24` (the previous position of the stone).
- Stone is at `pos34`.

After step 5:
- Agent is at `pos23`.
- Stone is at `pos34`.

After step 6:
- Agent is at `pos33`.
- Stone is at `pos34`.

After step 7:
- Agent is at `pos34` (the previous position of the stone).
- Stone is at `pos43` (the goal).

The plan successfully moves the stone to the goal location.

Actually, wait. I need to be more careful about the parameters of the push actions. The format of the push action is:
"pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d"

This means:
- p: the agent
- s: the stone
- l_p: the location of the agent
- l_from: the location of the stone
- l_to: the location to which the stone will be pushed
- d: the direction of the push

For step 4, I have:
"pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos14 pos24 pos34 dirright"

This means the agent is at `pos14`, the stone is at `pos24`, and the stone will be pushed to `pos34` in the direction `dirright`. But, I need to check if the agent at `pos14` can actually push the stone at `pos24` to the right.

For this, I need to confirm that:
1. I can get from `pos14` to `pos24` following `dirright`.
2. I can get from `pos24` to `pos34` following `dirright`.

Similarly, for step 7:
"pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos34 pos43 dirdown"

This means the agent is at `pos33`, the stone is at `pos34`, and the stone will be pushed to `pos43` in the direction `dirdown`. Again, I need to check if this push is valid.

Let me consult the given constraints:

For the "pushtonongoal" action:
(iv) you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d,
(v) you can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d

For "dirright", the row (first digit) increases. So, from `pos14`, using `dirright`, we'd get to `pos24`. This checks out.
From `pos24`, using `dirright`, we'd get to `pos34`. This checks out too.

For "dirdown", the column (second digit) increases. So, from `pos33`, using `dirdown`, we'd get to `pos34`. This checks out.
From `pos34`, using `dirdown`, we'd get to `pos35`. Wait, that's not right; we want to get to `pos43`. So, I think the direction should be "dirright" again, not "dirdown".

Let me revise step 7:
7. Push the stone from `pos34` to `pos43` following `dirright`: "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos34 pos43 dirright"

But wait, from `pos33`, using `dirright`, we'd get to `pos43`. But from `pos34`, using `dirright`, we'd get to `pos44`. That's not right.

Let me check the contraints for the push action more carefully...

"pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": You may only perform this action if (i) agent p is at location l_p, (ii) stone s is at location l_from, (iii) location l_to is clear, (iv) you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d, (v) you can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d, and (vi) location l_to is a goal location.

For step 7, I have:
- Agent is at `pos33`.
- Stone is at `pos34`.
- I want to push the stone to `pos43`.

So, for the direction, I need a direction `d` such that:
1. I can get from `pos33` to `pos34` following `d`.
2. I can get from `pos34` to `pos43` following `d`.

For the first constraint, we can use `dirdown` to get from `pos33` to `pos34`.
For the second constraint, we need to check: from `pos34`, using `dirdown`, we'd get to... Well, that would increase the column (second digit), so we'd get to `pos35`. That's not what we want. We want to get to `pos43`.

Let's check again:
- From `pos34` to `pos43` would involve increasing the row (first digit) by 1 and decreasing the column (second digit) by 1.

Wait, the grid might be different from what I imagined. Let me check the allowed moves again:

- "You may move from location pos34 to location pos24 following direction dirleft"
- "You may move from location pos34 to location pos44 following direction dirright"
- "You may move from location pos34 to location pos33 following direction dirup"
- "You may move from location pos34 to location pos35 following direction dirdown"

From this, it's clear:
- `dirright` increases the first digit (row).
- `dirleft` decreases the first digit (row).
- `dirdown` increases the second digit (column).
- `dirup` decreases the second digit (column).

Let me redraw the grid with this understanding:
```
    1   2   3   4   5  (row)
  +---+---+---+---+---+
1 | A |   |   |   |   |
  +---+---+---+---+---+
2 |   |   |   | S |   |
  +---+---+---+---+---+
3 |   |   |   |   |   |
  +---+---+---+---+---+
4 |   |   | G |   |   |
  +---+---+---+---+---+
5 |   |   |   |   |   |
  +---+---+---+---+---+
  (column)
```

So, to get from `pos34` to `pos43`, the agent would need to:
1. Move the stone from row 3 to row 4 (increase row by 1) using `dirright`.
2. Move the stone from column 4 to column 3 (decrease column by 1) using `dirup`.

That's not a single direction. So, the agent would need to push the stone twice, once to move it to the right and once to move it up.

Let's replan:

1. "move player1 pos11 pos12 dirdown"
2. "move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown"
3. "move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown"
4. "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos14 pos24 pos34 dirright"

Now, the agent is at `pos24` and the stone is at `pos34`.

To push the stone to the right (increasing the row) from `pos34` to `pos44`:
5. "move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup"
6. "move player1 pos23 pos33 dirright"

Hmm, but that doesn't save us much. We need to go back to `pos34` (from a different direction) to push it to `pos44`.

Let's try a different approach. Instead of going from `pos34` to `pos43` directly, let's go from `pos34` to `pos44` (push to the right) and then from `pos44` to `pos43` (push up).

5. Push the stone from `pos34` to `pos44` using `dirright`: "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos34 pos44 dirright"

After this, the agent is at `pos34` and the stone is at `pos44`.

6. Push the stone from `pos44` to `pos43` using `dirup`: "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos44 pos43 dirup"

So, the revised plan is:
1. "move player1 pos11 pos12 dirdown"
2. "move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown"
3. "move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown"
4. "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos14 pos24 pos34 dirright"
5. "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos34 pos44 dirright"
6. "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos44 pos43 dirup"

Wait, the last step doesn't work, because to push the stone up from `pos44` to `pos43`, the agent needs to be at `pos45`. 

Let's revise again:

After step 5, the agent is at `pos34` and the stone is at `pos44`.

To get from `pos34` to a position where you can push the stone up (from `pos44` to `pos43`), you'd need to be at `pos45`.

6. "move player1 pos34 pos35 dirdown"
7. "move player1 pos35 pos45 dirright"
8. "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos45 pos44 pos43 dirup"

So, the revised plan is:
1. "move player1 pos11 pos12 dirdown"
2. "move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown"
3. "move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown"
4. "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos14 pos24 pos34 dirright"
5. "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos34 pos44 dirright"
6. "move player1 pos34 pos35 dirdown"
7. "move player1 pos35 pos45 dirright"
8. "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos45 pos44 pos43 dirup"

Let me trace this again to make sure it's correct:

Start:
- Agent is at `pos11`.
- Stone is at `pos24`.
- Goal is at `pos43`.

After step 1:
- Agent is at `pos12`.
- Stone is at `pos24`.

After step 2:
- Agent is at `pos13`.
- Stone is at `pos24`.

After step 3:
- Agent is at `pos14`.
- Stone is at `pos24`.

After step 4:
- Agent is at `pos24`.
- Stone is at `pos34`.

After step 5:
- Agent is at `pos34`.
- Stone is at `pos44`.

After step 6:
- Agent is at `pos35`.
- Stone is at `pos44`.

After step 7:
- Agent is at `pos45`.
- Stone is at `pos44`.

After step 8:
- Agent is at `pos44`.
- Stone is at `pos43`.

So stone is at the goal. The plan seems to work, but let me check against the constraints of each action:

1. "move player1 pos11 pos12 dirdown"
   - agent is at pos11 ✓
   - pos12 is clear ✓
   - can get from pos11 to pos12 following dirdown ✓

2. "move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown"
   - agent is at pos12 ✓
   - pos13 is clear ✓
   - can get from pos12 to pos13 following dirdown ✓

3. "move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown"
   - agent is at pos13 ✓
   - pos14 is clear ✓
   - can get from pos13 to pos14 following dirdown ✓

4. "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos14 pos24 pos34 dirright"
   - agent is at pos14 ✓
   - stone is at pos24 ✓
   - pos34 is clear ✓
   - can get from pos14 to pos24 following dirright ✓
   - can get from pos24 to pos34 following dirright ✓
   - pos34 is not a goal location ✓

5. "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos34 pos44 dirright"
   - agent is at pos24 ✓
   - stone is at pos34 ✓
   - pos44 is clear ✓
   - can get from pos24 to pos34 following dirright ✓
   - can get from pos34 to pos44 following dirright ✓
   - pos44 is not a goal location ✓

6. "move player1 pos34 pos35 dirdown"
   - agent is at pos34 ✓
   - pos35 is clear ✓
   - can get from pos34 to pos35 following dirdown ✓

7. "move player1 pos35 pos45 dirright"
   - agent is at pos35 ✓
   - pos45 is clear ✓
   - can get from pos35 to pos45 following dirright ✓

8. "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos45 pos44 pos43 dirup"
   - agent is at pos45 ✓
   - stone is at pos44 ✓
   - pos43 is clear ✓
   - can get from pos45 to pos44 following dirup ✓
   - can get from pos44 to pos43 following dirup ✓
   - pos43 is a goal location ✓

Great, all the constraints for each action are satisfied!

Actually, I realized that we can do better! After step 4, the agent is at `pos24` and the stone is at `pos34`. From there, we can move the agent to `pos23` and then directly push the stone from `pos34` to `pos43`. This would save us a couple of moves.

Revised plan:
1. "move player1 pos11 pos12 dirdown"
2. "move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown"
3. "move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown"
4. "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos14 pos24 pos34 dirright"
5. "move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup"
6. "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos33 pos43 dirright"

Wait, but to push the stone from `pos33` to `pos43` using `dirright`, the stone needs to be at `pos33`. But it's at `pos34`. I think I missed something. Let me re-read the constraints again.

"pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": You may only perform this action if (i) agent p is at location l_p, (ii) stone s is at location l_from, (iii) location l_to is clear, (iv) you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d, (v) you can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d, and (vi) location l_to is a goal location.

So, for the "pushtogoal" action, the agent is at location `l_p`, the stone is at location `l_from`, and the stone will be pushed to location `l_to` in the direction `d`. The constraints ensure that the agent can reach the stone by going in the direction `d` from its current position, and the stone can be pushed to its target location by going in the same direction `d` from its current position.

Given this, let's reconsider step 6:
"pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos33 pos43 dirright"

This means the agent is at `pos23`, the stone is at `pos33`, and the stone will be pushed to `pos43` in the direction `dirright`.

But after step 5, the agent is at `pos23` and the stone is at `pos34`, not `pos33`. So, step 6 doesn't work as I've written it.

Let me go back to the original plan (which I'd already verified):
1. "move player1 pos11 pos12 dirdown"
2. "move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown"
3. "move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown"
4. "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos14 pos24 pos34 dirright"
5. "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos34 pos44 dirright"
6. "move player1 pos34 pos35 dirdown"
7. "move player1 pos35 pos45 dirright"
8. "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos45 pos44 pos43 dirup"

Hmm, wait. These actions are verbose, so let me make sure I understand the parameters correctly:

"pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d" means the agent `p`, currently at position `l_p`, pushes the stone `s` from position `l_from` to goal position `l_to`, following direction `d`.

So, after step 4, the agent is at `pos24` and the stone is at `pos34`. If the agent wants to move the stone to `pos43` from `pos34` using `dirright`, it should be at `pos24` (which it already is). The action would be:
"pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos34 pos44 dirright"

But that's not right, because `pos44` is not a goal location. I need to rethink this.

I know for sure that to get from `pos34` to `pos43`, I'd need to take two separate actions:
1. Move right to get to `pos44` (increasing the row).
2. Move up to get to `pos43` (decreasing the column).

Let's stick with the plan I'd verified:
1. "move player1 pos11 pos12 dirdown"
2. "move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown"
3. "move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown"
4. "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos14 pos24 pos34 dirright"
5. "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos34 pos44 dirright"
6. "move player1 pos34 pos35 dirdown"
7. "move player1 pos35 pos45 dirright"
8. "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos45 pos44 pos43 dirup"

Actually, I realized that there's a more efficient path from `pos34` to `pos43`. We can go:
- From `pos34` to `pos33` (using `dirup`).
- From `pos33` to `pos43` (using `dirright`).

So a better plan would be:
1. "move player1 pos11 pos12 dirdown"
2. "move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown"
3. "move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown"
4. "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos14 pos24 pos34 dirright"
5. "move player1 pos24 pos25 dirdown"
6. "move player1 pos25 pos35 dirright"
7. "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos35 pos34 pos33 dirup"
8. "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos33 pos43 dirright"

Wait, this isn't right. The agent is at `pos24` after step 4, not at `pos34`. Let me rethink this.

I already had a verified plan:
1. "move player1 pos11 pos12 dirdown"
2. "move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown"
3. "move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown"
4. "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos14 pos24 pos34 dirright"
5. "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos34 pos44 dirright"
6. "move player1 pos34 pos35 dirdown"
7. "move player1 pos35 pos45 dirright"
8. "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos45 pos44 pos43 dirup"

But there's a more direct path I've been trying to find. After step 4, the agent is at `pos24` and the stone is at `pos34`. 

If the agent moves to `pos35` (by going down from `pos34`), it could push the stone up from `pos34` to `pos33`:
5. "move player1 pos24 pos25 dirdown"
6. "move player1 pos25 pos35 dirright"
7. "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos35 pos34 pos33 dirup"

Now, the agent is at `pos34` and the stone is at `pos33`. The agent can push the stone to `pos43`:
8. "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos33 pos43 dirright"

So, the potentially more efficient plan is:
1. "move player1 pos11 pos12 dirdown"
2. "move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown"
3. "move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown"
4. "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos14 pos24 pos34 dirright"
5. "move player1 pos24 pos25 dirdown"
6. "move player1 pos25 pos35 dirright"
7. "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos35 pos34 pos33 dirup"
8. "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos33 pos43 dirright"

Let me trace this again to make sure it's correct:

Start:
- Agent is at `pos11`.
- Stone is at `pos24`.
- Goal is at `pos43`.

After step 1:
- Agent is at `pos12`.
- Stone is at `pos24`.

After step 2:
- Agent is at `pos13`.
- Stone is at `pos24`.

After step 3:
- Agent is at `pos14`.
- Stone is at `pos24`.

After step 4:
- Agent is at `pos24`.
- Stone is at `pos34`.

After step 5:
- Agent is at `pos25`.
- Stone is at `pos34`.

After step 6:
- Agent is at `pos35`.
- Stone is at `pos34`.

After step 7:
- Agent is at `pos34`.
- Stone is at `pos33`.

After step 8:
- Agent is at `pos33`.
- Stone is at `pos43`.

So, stone is at the goal. The plan seems to work.

Let me check against the constraints of each action for this new plan:

1. "move player1 pos11 pos12 dirdown"
   - agent is at pos11 ✓
   - pos12 is clear ✓
   - can get from pos11 to pos12 following dirdown ✓

2. "move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown"
   - agent is at pos12 ✓
   - pos13 is clear ✓
   - can get from pos12 to pos13 following dirdown ✓

3. "move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown"
   - agent is at pos13 ✓
   - pos14 is clear ✓
   - can get from pos13 to pos14 following dirdown ✓

4. "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos14 pos24 pos34 dirright"
   - agent is at pos14 ✓
   - stone is at pos24 ✓
   - pos34 is clear ✓
   - can get from pos14 to pos24 following dirright ✓
   - can get from pos24 to pos34 following dirright ✓
   - pos34 is not a goal location ✓

5. "move player1 pos24 pos25 dirdown"
   - agent is at pos24 ✓
   - pos25 is clear ✓
   - can get from pos24 to pos25 following dirdown ✓

6. "move player1 pos25 pos35 dirright"
   - agent is at pos25 ✓
   - pos35 is clear ✓
   - can get from pos25 to pos35 following dirright ✓

7. "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos35 pos34 pos33 dirup"
   - agent is at pos35 ✓
   - stone is at pos34 ✓
   - pos33 is clear ✓
   - can get from pos35 to pos34 following dirup ✓
   - can get from pos34 to pos33 following dirup ✓
   - pos33 is not a goal location ✓

8. "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos33 pos43 dirright"
   - agent is at pos34 ✓
   - stone is at pos33 ✓
   - pos43 is clear ✓
   - can get from pos34 to pos33 following dirleft (not dirright) ✗

Ah, I made a mistake in step 8. To push the stone from `pos33` to `pos43` using `dirright`, the agent needs to be at a position such that it can get to `pos33` following `dirright`. The agent is at `pos34`. From `pos34`, can the agent get to `pos33` following `dirright`? No. The agent would need to go to `pos23` for that.

Let me think about this again. From `pos34` using `dirleft` (not `dirright`), the agent would get to `pos24`. From `pos24` using `dirleft`, the agent would get to `pos14`. That's not what I want.

To push the stone from `pos33` to `pos43` using `dirright`, the agent would need to be at `pos23`. To get to `pos23` from `pos34`, the agent would need to go left to `pos24` and then up to `pos23`. 

Let's revise step 8:
8. "move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft"
9. "move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup"
10. "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos33 pos43 dirright"

So, the revised plan is:
1. "move player1 pos11 pos12 dirdown"
2. "move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown"
3. "move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown"
4. "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos14 pos24 pos34 dirright"
5. "move player1 pos24 pos25 dirdown"
6. "move player1 pos25 pos35 dirright"
7. "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos35 pos34 pos33 dirup"
8. "move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft"
9. "move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup"
10. "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos33 pos43 dirright"

Let me check step 10 again:
10. "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos33 pos43 dirright"
   - agent is at pos23 ✓
   - stone is at pos33 ✓
   - pos43 is clear ✓
   - can get from pos23 to pos33 following dirright ✓
   - can get from pos33 to pos43 following dirright ✓
   - pos43 is a goal location ✓

Great, all the constraints for each action are satisfied!

But now I'm wondering if there's a shorter path. 

After step 4, the agent is at `pos24` and the stone is at `pos34`. We want to move the stone to `pos43`. 

Can we do this in fewer steps?

Let's see. From `pos24`, the agent can go:
- Left to `pos14`
- Right to `pos34` (but the stone is there, so the agent can't move there directly)
- Up to `pos23`
- Down to `pos25`

Going up to `pos23` seems promising because from there, the agent can push the stone from `pos33` to `pos43`. But the stone is at `pos34`, not `pos33`. So, we'd need to push the stone from `pos34` to `pos33` first.

To push the stone from `pos34` to `pos33` using `dirup`, the agent needs to be at `pos35`. To get there, the agent can go from `pos24` to `pos25` and then from `pos25` to `pos35`.

5. "move player1 pos24 pos25 dirdown"
6. "move player1 pos25 pos35 dirright"
7. "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos35 pos34 pos33 dirup"

Now, the agent is at `pos34` and the stone is at `pos33`. To push the stone from `pos33` to `pos43` using `dirright`, the agent needs to be at `pos23`. To get there, the agent can go from `pos34` to `pos24` and then from `pos24` to `pos23`.

8. "move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft"
9. "move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup"
10. "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos33 pos43 dirright"

This gives us the plan I'd already derived.

Let's just check if there are any other more efficient paths.

After step 4, the agent is at `pos24` and the stone is at `pos34`.

Alternatively, the agent can push the stone further right to `pos44`:
5. "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos34 pos44 dirright"

Now, the agent is at `pos34` and the stone is at `pos44`. To push the stone from `pos44` to `pos43` using `dirup`, the agent needs to be at `pos45`. To get there, the agent can go from `pos34` to `pos35` and then from `pos35` to `pos45`.

6. "move player1 pos34 pos35 dirdown"
7. "move player1 pos35 pos45 dirright"
8. "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos45 pos44 pos43 dirup"

This gives us 8 actions, which is less than the 10 actions in the previous plan. So, this is the more efficient path.

Let's double-check step 8 to ensure it satisfies all the constraints:
8. "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos45 pos44 pos43 dirup"
   - agent is at pos45 ✓
   - stone is at pos44 ✓
   - pos43 is clear ✓
   - can get from pos45 to pos44 following dirup ✓
   - can get from pos44 to pos43 following dirup ✓
   - pos43 is a goal location ✓

Great, all the constraints for this plan are satisfied!

Final plan:
1. "move player1 pos11 pos12 dirdown"
2. "move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown"
3. "move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown"
4. "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos14 pos24 pos34 dirright"
5. "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos34 pos44 dirright"
6. "move player1 pos34 pos35 dirdown"
7. "move player1 pos35 pos45 dirright"
8. "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos45 pos44 pos43 dirup"
