Okay, let's try to figure out how to solve this planning problem. The goal is to get stone1, which is initially at pos24, to a goal location. The only goal location mentioned is pos43. So I need to move stone1 from pos24 to pos43 using the agent player1 who starts at pos11.

First, I need to figure out the path the agent can take to reach the stone. The agent is at pos11. Looking at the movement possibilities, from pos11, the agent can move right to pos21 or down to pos12. Let's see which path gets the agent closer to pos24.

If the agent moves right to pos21, then from pos21, they can move down to pos22. From pos22, down to pos23, then down to pos24. That seems like a possible route. Alternatively, moving down to pos12 first. Let's map out both options.

Option 1: pos11 → pos21 (right) → pos22 (down) → pos23 (down) → pos24 (down). That's three moves to reach pos24 where the stone is. Then, once the agent is at pos24, they need to push the stone to pos34 (right?), but wait, pos34 is not a goal. The goal is pos43. Hmm. So after pushing the stone, where can it go?

Wait, the stone is at pos24. The agent needs to be adjacent to it to push. So to push the stone from pos24 to pos34 (right direction), but pos34 is not a goal. Then, perhaps push it further. Let's see the possible directions from pos24. According to the movement rules, from pos24, you can go right to pos34, up to pos23, left to pos14, or down to pos25. But pushing the stone towards pos34 (right) would require the agent to be at pos24 and push it. But how does the agent get to pos24 in the first place?

Alternatively, maybe the agent can approach from a different direction. Let's think about the path. The stone is at pos24. To push it towards the goal pos43, which is in the third row (row 4) and third column (column 3). Wait, pos43 is row 4, column 3. The stone is at pos24 (row 2, column4). So the stone needs to move down to row3, then right to column4, but that doesn't seem right. Wait, maybe I need to look at the grid layout.

Wait, the positions are labeled as posXY where X is the row and Y is the column. So pos43 is row4, column3. The stone is at pos24 (row2, column4). So to get to pos43, the stone needs to move down two rows (from row2 to row4) and left one column (from column4 to column3). But moving down from row2 to row3, then row4. But the agent can only push the stone in directions adjacent.

Alternatively, maybe the agent can push the stone left to pos14, then down to pos24 again? Wait, that doesn't help. Let me think again.

The goal is pos43. So the stone needs to be moved from pos24 to pos34, then to pos44, then left to pos43? Wait, pos43 is in row4, column3. So pos34 is row3, column4. So maybe that's not the right path. Alternatively, can the stone be moved left from pos24 to pos23, then down to pos33, then right to pos34, then down to pos44, then left to pos43? But that seems long. Wait, maybe there's a shorter path.

Alternatively, perhaps the agent can push the stone up to pos23, then left to pos22, then down to pos32, then right to pos33, then right to pos34, then down to pos44, then left to pos43. Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let's see if there's a more direct path.

Wait, pos24 is row2, column4. The goal is pos43 (row4, column3). So the stone needs to go down two rows and left one column. Let's see the possible moves:

From pos24, pushing the stone left (dirleft) would take it to pos14 (row1, column4), which is a non-goal. Not helpful. Pushing down would take it to pos25 (row2, column5), also non-goal. Pushing right to pos34 (row3, column4), which is not a goal. Pushing up to pos23 (row2, column3), non-goal. So the stone is at pos24. The agent needs to get to a position adjacent to pos24 in a direction that allows pushing towards the goal.

Wait, pos34 is row3, column4. From there, can the stone be pushed right to pos44 (row4, column4), then left to pos43? But pos44 is not a goal, but pos43 is. So after pushing to pos44, then left to pos43 (goal). So that's two pushes. But how does the agent get into position to do that.

Alternatively, the agent can push the stone from pos24 to pos34 (right), then from pos34 to pos44 (right again), then from pos44 to pos43 (left). But each push requires the agent to be in the correct position.

Let's plan step by step.

First, the agent starts at pos11. Needs to reach pos24. Let's see the path.

From pos11, move right to pos21 (action move player1 pos11 pos21 dirright). Then from pos21, move down to pos22 (dirright? Wait, no. The movement from pos21 to pos22 is direction dirdown. Let me check the given movement possibilities.

Looking back, for pos21: "You may move from location pos21 to location pos11 following direction dirleft", "You may move from location pos21 to location pos31 following direction dirright", "You may move from location pos21 to location pos22 following direction dirdown". So pos21 can go down to pos22.

So agent moves pos11 → pos21 (dirright), then pos21 → pos22 (dirdown), then pos22 → pos23 (dirdown), then pos23 → pos24 (dirdown). So four moves to get to pos24. Wait, no: pos11 to pos21 is one move. Then pos21 to pos22 is second. pos22 to pos23 third. pos23 to pos24 fourth. So four moves to reach pos24.

But once the agent is at pos24, they need to push the stone. But the stone is at pos24. Wait, no: the initial state says "stone1 is at location pos24", and "Location pos24 is clear" (original state). Wait, no. Wait, the original state says "stone1 is at location pos24", but "Location pos24 is clear"? Wait, no. Let me check the original state again.

Looking at the original state:

"player1 is at location pos11"

"stone1 is at location pos24"

"Location pos12 is clear"

... (many locations listed as clear, including "Location pos24 is clear" — wait, no, looking at the list, under "The original state of the world is the following":

Wait, in the "original state" section, after listing the player and stone positions, there's a list of clear locations. Let me check:

Looking at the list:

"Location pos12 is clear"

... (continues down to)

"Location pos23 is clear"

"Location pos25 is clear"

... then later "pos43 is a goal location"

Then after the movement possibilities, there's "pos11 is not a goal location", etc.

Wait, in the original state, after all the movement rules, there's "Location pos11 is clear" and "Location pos24 is clear". Wait, but the stone is at pos24. So that's a contradiction. Or is it possible that the initial state has both the stone at pos24 and pos24 is clear? That can't be. Because if the stone is there, the location isn't clear. But according to the problem statement, the initial state has "stone1 is at location pos24" and "Location pos24 is clear". That must be a mistake. But perhaps it's a typo, or maybe "clear" refers to being free of the agent. Wait, in the problem description, each position may contain the agent, a stone, or be empty. So "clear" probably means that neither the agent nor a stone is present. But that's conflicting with the initial state. So maybe there's an error here. But according to the given original state:

"player1 is at location pos11"

"stone1 is at location pos24"

Then in the list of clear locations, "Location pos24 is clear" is not mentioned. Wait, looking again:

The original state's clear locations include:

"Location pos12 is clear"

"Location pos13 is clear"

...

"Location pos21 is clear"

"Location pos22 is clear"

"Location pos23 is clear"

"Location pos25 is clear"

...

Then later, after all the movement possibilities and goal/non-goal locations, there's:

"Location pos11 is clear"

"Location pos24 is clear"

Wait, this is confusing. So the initial state has "stone1 is at pos24" but then says "Location pos24 is clear". That's impossible. Unless "clear" here refers to the agent not being there. Because the stone is there. So perhaps the definition of "clear" is that the agent is not present. Because the problem says "each position may contain either the agent, a stone or be empty". So a location is clear if it's empty (no agent or stone). But then, if a stone is at pos24, pos24 is not clear. But according to the original state, "Location pos24 is clear". So this seems like a contradiction. This must be a mistake in the problem description. But perhaps I need to proceed under the assumption that the problem is correctly specified. Wait, maybe "clear" means that the agent is not present. So a location can have a stone and still be considered clear for the agent to move there? That doesn't make sense. Because the agent can't move into a location with a stone. Because the preconditions for move actions require that the target location is clear. So if a stone is there, the location is not clear, and the agent can't move there. So in the initial state, pos24 has stone1, so it's not clear. But according to the problem's original state, "Location pos24 is clear" is listed. So this is conflicting. There's a mistake here.

But maybe the problem intended that the stone is at pos24, and pos24 is not clear. So perhaps the "Location pos24 is clear" in the original state is a typo and should not be there. Alternatively, perhaps "clear" refers to the agent's presence. But that's inconsistent with the action preconditions. For example, the move action requires that the target location is clear. If the target has a stone, the agent can't move there. So the initial state must have pos24 as not clear because the stone is there. Therefore, the problem statement has an error. But how to proceed? The user provided the problem as is. Maybe it's a mistake in the problem statement, but I have to work with it.

Assuming that the problem's original state correctly lists "Location pos24 is clear" even though the stone is there. But that would mean that the stone is not considered when determining if a location is clear. That can't be right. Because the actions' preconditions for pushing require that the stone is at a certain location, which would conflict with the location being clear. So perhaps there's a misunderstanding here.

Wait, looking at the problem's action preconditions: For "move p l_from l_to d", the preconditions are (i) agent p is at l_from, (ii) l_to is clear, and (iii) movement possible. So "clear" here means that l_to is not occupied by the agent or a stone. So if a stone is at pos24, then pos24 is not clear. Therefore, in the original state, pos24 has a stone, so it's not clear. But according to the problem's original state, it says "Location pos24 is clear". That's a contradiction. This must be an error in the problem statement. But since I have to work with the given information, perhaps I should proceed under the assumption that the stone is at pos24 and pos24 is not clear, despite the problem statement saying it is. Or perhaps the problem statement has a typo and the stone is at a different location. But the user provided the problem as is.

Alternatively, maybe the "Location pos24 is clear" in the original state is after considering that the stone is there. But that doesn't make sense. I'm confused. This seems like a critical error. But perhaps the problem intended that the stone is at pos24, and pos24 is not clear. So the "Location pos24 is clear" in the original state is a mistake. So I should ignore that and proceed. Therefore, in the initial state, pos24 has the stone, so it's not clear. Therefore, the agent cannot move into pos24. Therefore, to push the stone, the agent needs to be adjacent to pos24.

Wait, but the agent is at pos11. The stone is at pos24. The agent needs to move to a position adjacent to pos24 to push it. So pos24 is at row2, column4. Adjacent positions are pos23 (left), pos14 (up?), pos25 (down), pos34 (right). Wait, the directions are defined based on the grid. For example, moving from pos23 to pos24 is down? Or is it right? Let me check the movement rules.

Looking at the movement possibilities: For example, "You may move from location pos24 to location pos14 following direction dirleft". So from pos24, moving left (dirleft) takes you to pos14. So pos14 is to the left of pos24. That suggests that the columns are numbered left to right. So pos24 is row2, column4. To the left (dirleft) would decrease the column number. So pos23 is column3, same row. So pos24's left neighbor is pos23? Wait, no. Because pos24's left is pos23? Let me check.

Looking at the movement from pos24: "You may move from location pos24 to location pos14 following direction dirleft". Wait, pos14 is row1, column4. So that's up, not left. So perhaps the direction naming is inconsistent. This is getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the directions are as follows:

- dirup: move up a row (row decreases by 1)
- dirdown: move down a row (row increases by 1)
- dirleft: move left a column (column decreases by 1)
- dirright: move right a column (column increases by 1)

But looking at the movement from pos11 to pos21 is dirright. pos11 is row1, column1. pos21 is row2, column1. So moving right here increases the row? That doesn't align with standard grid directions. So maybe the rows are vertical (north-south) and columns are horizontal (east-west). Or perhaps the directions are differently defined.

Alternatively, the movement directions are based on the grid layout where moving right increases the row number, and moving down increases the column number. That could be possible, but it's not standard. This confusion makes it hard to plan.

Alternatively, perhaps the grid is such that moving dirright from pos11 takes you to pos12 (same row, next column), but according to the problem statement, "You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright". So pos11 to pos21 is dirright. So pos21 is row2, column1. So dirright increases the row number. So the grid is such that moving right increases the row, not the column. That's unconventional, but according to the problem's movement rules, that's how it's structured.

So, for example:

pos11 (row1, column1)

dirright from pos11 leads to pos21 (row2, column1). So dirright increases the row by 1.

dirdown from pos11 leads to pos12 (row1, column2). So dirdown increases the column by 1.

dirleft would decrease the row, and dirup would decrease the column.

This is a bit confusing, but given the movement rules provided, this seems to be the case.

So, the grid is structured such that:

- dirright: row +1, same column
- dirleft: row -1, same column
- dirdown: column +1, same row
- dirup: column -1, same row

So pos11 is row1, column1. Moving right (dirright) goes to pos21 (row2, column1). Moving down (dirdown) goes to pos12 (row1, column2).

Given this, the stone is at pos24 (row2, column4). The goal is pos43 (row4, column3). So the stone needs to move from (2,4) to (4,3). To do this, the agent needs to push the stone.

Let's think about the path for the stone:

From pos24 (row2, column4), possible pushes:

- pushtogoal or pushtonongoal, depending on the destination.

But the goal is pos43 (row4, column3). So the stone needs to move south (dirright) twice (from row2 to row4) and west (dirup) once (from column4 to column3). But how to achieve this.

Let's consider pushing the stone south (dirright) to pos34 (row3, column4), then south again to pos44 (row4, column4), then west (dirup) to pos43 (row4, column3). So three pushes.

Each push requires the agent to be adjacent to the stone in the direction of the push.

So the agent needs to get to the opposite side of the stone relative to the push direction.

For example, to push the stone from pos24 to pos34 (dirright), the agent needs to be at pos24 and move dirright to pos34, but wait, the action is "pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d". The preconditions require that the agent is at l_p, which is adjacent to l_from (stone's current location) in the direction d. So for pushing the stone from l_from to l_to with direction d, the agent must be at l_p, which is in the opposite direction of d from l_from. Because to push the stone east (dirright?), the agent must be west of the stone. Wait, the direction is the direction from the agent's position to the stone's position.

Wait, the precondition for pushing is that you can get from l_p to l_from following direction d. So if the agent is at l_p and the stone is at l_from, then l_p is in the direction opposite to d from l_from. For example, if the agent is pushing the stone east (dirright) from l_from to l_to, then the agent must be west of l_from (l_p = l_from's west neighbor), and direction d would be dirright (from l_p to l_from). Then, pushing the stone east requires the agent to be west of the stone.

Wait, the action is "pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d". The agent is at l_p, pushes the stone from l_from to l_to. The direction d is the direction from l_p to l_from. So, for example, if the agent is at pos24 and the stone is at pos34, but no, that's not right. Let me clarify.

The direction d in the push action is the direction from the agent's current location (l_p) to the stone's current location (l_from). Then, the stone is pushed from l_from to l_to, which is in the same direction d. So the agent is behind the stone relative to the push direction.

For example, to push the stone from pos24 to pos34 (dirright), the agent must be at pos14 (since moving dirright from pos14 to pos24). So the agent is at pos14, pushes the stone from pos24 to pos34 (dirright). But wait, the direction d in the action is the direction from the agent's location to the stone's current location. So in this case, d would be dirright (from pos14 to pos24). Then, the stone moves in the same direction to pos34.

But wait, pos14 is row1, column4. pos24 is row2, column4. So dirright from pos14 to pos24 (since moving right increases the row). So to push the stone from pos24 to pos34 (dirright), the agent must be at pos24's west (dirright direction from agent's position to stone's position). Wait, no. The agent is at l_p, which is pos14, and direction d is dirright (from pos14 to pos24). Then the stone is pushed from pos24 to pos34, which is also dirright from pos24. So the direction d in the action is the direction from the agent's position to the stone's current position. The stone then moves in the same direction d to l_to.

So for the first push, to move the stone from pos24 to pos34 (dirright), the agent needs to be at pos14 (l_p = pos14), l_from = pos24, direction d = dirright. Then the stone moves to pos34.

But how does the agent get to pos14? Initially, the agent is at pos11. To reach pos14, the agent can move down (dirdown) to pos12, then down to pos13, then down to pos14. Let's verify the movement possibilities:

From pos11, can move dirdown to pos12. From pos12, dirdown to pos13. From pos13, dirdown to pos14. Then from pos14, dirright to pos24? But pos24 has the stone. Wait, but the agent can't move into pos24 if it's not clear. But according to the original state, pos24 has the stone, so it's not clear. So the agent can't move into pos24. Therefore, the agent needs to reach pos14, then perform the push action.

So the steps would be:

1. Move from pos11 to pos12 (dirdown)
2. Move to pos13 (dirdown)
3. Move to pos14 (dirdown)
4. Perform pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos14 pos24 pos34 dirright

Then, the stone is at pos34. Now, the agent is at pos24 (after the push). But pos34 is not a goal location. The next step is to push the stone further to pos44 (dirright). So the agent needs to be at pos34's west neighbor (pos24), but wait, the agent is now at pos24 after the first push. So to push the stone from pos34 to pos44 (dirright), the agent needs to be at pos34's west neighbor (pos24), and direction d is dirright. Then, the stone moves from pos34 to pos44. So the action would be pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos34 pos44 dirright.

But pos44 is not a goal. The goal is pos43. So after pushing to pos44, the stone is at pos44, which is row4, column4. Then, the agent needs to push it west (dirleft) to pos43 (row4, column3). But to do that, the agent must be east of pos44, which is pos45 (but pos45 is column5, row4). Wait, the direction for pushing west would require the agent to be at pos44's east neighbor. But pos44's east neighbor is pos54 (dirright from pos44? Wait, according to movement rules, from pos44: "You may move from location pos44 to location pos34 following direction dirleft", "You may move from location pos44 to location pos54 following direction dirright", etc. So pos44's dirright is pos54 (row5, column4). So that's not helpful. Alternatively, to push the stone west from pos44 to pos43 (dirleft), the agent needs to be at pos44's east neighbor (pos54) and push west. But pos54 is not adjacent to pos44 in the west direction. Wait, I'm getting confused again.

Alternatively, the agent is at pos34, and after pushing to pos44, the agent is at pos34. Wait, no. When you perform the pushtogoal action, the agent moves from l_p (pos24) to l_from (pos34), and the stone moves to l_to (pos44). So after the first push, the agent is at pos24. Then, to push the stone from pos34 to pos44, the agent needs to be at pos24 (l_p) again? Because pos24 is west of pos34 (dirright from pos24 to pos34). So the direction is dirright. Then the action would be pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos34 pos44 dirright.

After that, the stone is at pos44, and the agent is at pos34. Now, to push the stone from pos44 to pos43 (dirleft), the agent needs to be east of pos44. The east neighbor of pos44 is pos54 (dirright from pos44 to pos54). So the agent needs to be at pos54 to push the stone west to pos43. But how does the agent get there?

Alternatively, maybe there's a different path. Let's think again. After the stone is at pos34, perhaps the agent can push it south (dirdown) to pos35, but pos35 is not a goal. Hmm.

Alternatively, after pushing the stone to pos34, the agent could move to pos33 (left from pos34?), but I'm not sure. This is getting too complicated. Let me try to outline the steps again.

Initial positions:

Agent: pos11

Stone: pos24

Goal: pos43 (row4, column3)

Plan:

1. Agent moves from pos11 to pos12 (dirdown)
2. Agent moves to pos13 (dirdown)
3. Agent moves to pos14 (dirdown)
4. Agent pushes stone from pos24 to pos34 (dirright) using pushtogoal. This requires agent to be at pos14, direction dirright to pos24. So action: pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos14 pos24 pos34 dirright.

After this, the stone is at pos34 (row3, column4), agent is at pos24.

Next, push from pos34 to pos44 (dirright):

Agent is at pos24. To push the stone from pos34 to pos44, the agent needs to be at pos34's west neighbor (pos24), direction dirright. So action: pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos34 pos44 dirright.

Now, stone is at pos44, agent is at pos34.

Next, push from pos44 to pos43 (dirleft):

To push west from pos44 to pos43, the agent must be east of pos44. The east neighbor of pos44 is pos54 (dirright from pos44 to pos54). So agent needs to move to pos54.

But how? Agent is currently at pos34. Need to move to pos44, then to pos54. But pos44 has the stone, which is now at pos44. So pos44 is not clear. So the agent can't move into pos44.

Alternative path: agent needs to move around. From pos34, possible movements:

From pos34, can move dirleft to pos24, dirright to pos44 (but pos44 is occupied by the stone), dirdown to pos35, or dirup to pos33.

So agent can move from pos34 to pos35 (dirdown), then to pos45, then to pos55? Not sure. Alternatively, move to pos33 (dirup?), but direction up here would be column-1. So pos33 is row3, column3.

Alternatively, the agent can move from pos34 to pos33 (dirup), then pos33 to pos43 (dirright). Wait, pos43 is the goal location. But pos43 is row4, column3. So from pos33 (row3, column3), moving dirdown (column+1) would be to row3, column4 (pos34), but pos34 is already clear? No, pos34 was the previous location of the stone. Now, after the second push, the stone is at pos44. So pos34 is clear. Wait, after pushing the stone from pos34 to pos44, the agent ends up at pos34. Then pos34 is now clear because the stone moved to pos44, and the agent is there. Wait, no. The effect of pushtogoal is that the agent moves to l_from (pos34), and the stone moves to l_to (pos44). So after the second push, the agent is at pos34, which is now occupied by the agent, so pos34 is not clear. Therefore, the agent can't move from pos34 to pos35 because pos34 is occupied by the agent himself. Wait, no. The agent is at pos34 after the push. So moving from pos34 would require that the next location is clear.

But this is getting too tangled. Maybe there's a shorter path. Let me try to think differently.

Alternative approach: The stone needs to go to pos43. The only goal is pos43. The agent starts at pos11. Maybe the agent can take a different route to push the stone.

For example, move from pos11 to pos21 (dirright), then to pos22 (dirdown), then to pos23 (dirdown), then to pos24 (dirdown). But pos24 has the stone. So the agent can't move into pos24. So after reaching pos23, the agent is adjacent to pos24 (south). Then, can the agent push the stone east to pos34?

Wait, to push the stone east from pos24 to pos34, the agent must be west of pos24. But the agent is at pos23, which is south of pos24. So the directions don't align. To push east, the agent must be west (pos14). So that's not possible from pos23.

Alternatively, the agent is at pos23 and can push the stone north (dirup) to pos24, but the stone is already there. No.

Alternatively, the agent can push the stone down (dirdown) to pos25. But pos25 is not a goal. So that's not helpful.

Hmm. So perhaps the initial approach of moving to pos14 to push east is better.

So steps 1-4: agent moves to pos14 and pushes stone to pos34.

Then, from pos24 (agent is there after the first push), he can move to pos25 (dirdown), then to pos35 (dirright), then to pos45 (dirright), then to pos44 (dirup). But pos44 has the stone. Wait, after first push, stone is at pos34. Agent is at pos24.

Wait, after the first push (pushtogoal from pos14 to pos24 to pos34), the agent is now at pos24, and the stone is at pos34. Then, the agent can move from pos24 to pos34 (dirright), but pos34 has the stone. No, because the stone is there, pos34 is not clear. So agent can't move there.

Alternatively, the agent can move from pos24 to pos25 (dirdown), then to pos35 (dirright), then to pos45 (dirright), then to pos44 (dirup). Then, from pos44, the agent can push the stone from pos34 to pos44. Wait, but the stone is at pos34. So to push it to pos44, agent needs to be at pos34's west neighbor (pos24), but he's at pos44. That's not possible.

This is getting too complicated. Maybe I need to find a different path. Let's try to outline the steps again.

Step 1: Agent moves from pos11 to pos12 (dirdown)

Step 2: Agent moves to pos13 (dirdown)

Step 3: Agent moves to pos14 (dirdown)

Step 4: Agent performs pushtogoal to push stone from pos24 to pos34 (dirright). Now, stone is at pos34, agent is at pos24.

Step 5: Agent needs to push stone from pos34 to pos44 (dirright). To do this, agent must be at pos24 (west of pos34). So action: pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos34 pos44 dirright. Now, stone is at pos44, agent is at pos34.

Step 6: Now, push stone from pos44 to pos43 (dirleft). To do this, the agent must be east of pos44 (pos54), but how to get there.

Agent is at pos34. Needs to move to pos44, but pos44 has the stone. So can't. Alternatively, agent can move from pos34 to pos35 (dirdown), then to pos45 (dirright), then to pos55 (dirright), then to pos54 (dirup). Then, from pos54, push the stone west to pos44 to pos43.

But pos54 is row5, column4. To push west from pos44 to pos43, the agent needs to be east of pos44 (pos54), and direction dirleft (from pos54 to pos44). So action: pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos54 pos44 pos43 dirleft.

But how does the agent get to pos54?

From pos34:

Step 5.1: Move from pos34 to pos35 (dirdown)

Step 5.2: Move from pos35 to pos45 (dirright)

Step 5.3: Move from pos45 to pos55 (dirright)

Step 5.4: Move from pos55 to pos54 (dirup)

Then, perform the push.

But this is a lot of steps. Let's count:

Steps 1-4: 4 actions.

Steps 5 (push to pos44): 5th action.

Steps 5.1-5.4: 4 moves, then push. Total actions so far: 4 +1 +4 +1 = 10 actions. That's probably not optimal.

But perhaps there's a shorter way. Let's think again.

After step 5: stone at pos44, agent at pos34.

From pos34, the agent can move dirleft to pos24, then dirup to pos23, then dirleft to pos22, etc., to go around to reach pos54. But that's also lengthy.

Alternatively, after pushing to pos44, the agent is at pos34. To reach pos54, the agent can move:

pos34 → pos35 (dirdown)

pos35 → pos45 (dirright)

pos45 → pos55 (dirright)

pos55 → pos54 (dirup)

Then, from pos54, push the stone west to pos43.

But that's four moves plus the push. So total actions would be 4 (initial moves) + 1 (first push) + 1 (second push) + 4 (moves to pos54) +1 (third push) = 11 actions. That's too long. The problem says to provide an optimal plan with minimal steps.

There must be a better way. Let's see:

Wait, after the second push (stone at pos44), the agent is at pos34. Can the agent move from pos34 to pos44 (dirright)? pos44 has the stone, so it's not clear. So no. Then, the agent can move from pos34 to pos33 (dirleft?), but how.

Wait, from pos34, the movement possibilities are:

"You may move from location pos34 to location pos24 following direction dirleft"

"You may move from location pos34 to location pos44 following direction dirright"

"You may move from location pos34 to location pos33 following direction dirup"

"You may move from location pos34 to location pos35 following direction dirdown"

So agent can move from pos34 to pos33 (dirup), which is row3, column3.

From pos33, the agent can move dirright to pos34 (but it's occupied), or dirdown to pos43 (row4, column3). Wait, pos43 is the goal location. So pos33 to pos43: is there a movement possibility?

Looking back at the movement rules:

From pos33: "You may move from location pos33 to location pos23 following direction dirleft", "You may move from location pos33 to location pos43 following direction dirright", "You may move from location pos33 to location pos32 following direction dirup", "You may move from location pos33 to location pos34 following direction dirdown".

Wait, moving dirright from pos33 to pos43. Because dirright increases the row. pos33 is row3, column3. dirright would increase row to 4, so pos43 (row4, column3). Yes, that's a valid move. So from pos33, the agent can move dirright to pos43.

So after step 5 (stone at pos44, agent at pos34), the agent can:

Step 6: Move from pos34 to pos33 (dirup)

Step 7: Move from pos33 to pos43 (dirright)

Now, the agent is at pos43, which is the goal location. But the stone is at pos44. The agent needs to push it west to pos43. But pos43 is already a goal location. However, the stone is at pos44, so to push it to pos43, the agent must be east of pos44 (pos54), push west. But the agent is at pos43. Can't reach pos54 from here.

Alternatively, perhaps the agent can move from pos43 to pos44 (dirright), but pos44 has the stone, so no. Alternatively, agent can move from pos43 to pos42 (dirup), then to pos41, etc. Not helpful.

Hmm. This approach isn't working. Maybe there's a different path after the first two pushes.

After the stone is at pos44, the agent is at pos34. From there, the agent can move to pos33 (dirup), then to pos43 (dirright). Now, the agent is at pos43. Then, the agent can move to pos53 (dirdown), then to pos54 (dirright), then to pos55 (dirdown), but this seems too long.

Alternatively, from pos43, can the agent move to pos53 (dirdown), then to pos54 (dirright), then push the stone west to pos43. But pos53 is row5, column3. Moving dirright from pos53 to pos54 (row5, column4). Then, from pos54, push west to pos44 (dirleft), but pos44 is the stone's current location. Wait, no. The stone is at pos44. So to push it west from pos44 to pos43, the agent must be at pos54 (east of pos44), and direction dirleft (from pos54 to pos44). Then, the push action would move the stone from pos44 to pos43 (west). So the action would be pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos54 pos44 pos43 dirleft. But the agent needs to reach pos54.

So steps after stone is at pos44:

Agent is at pos34.

1. Move to pos35 (dirdown)
2. Move to pos45 (dirright)
3. Move to pos55 (dirright)
4. Move to pos54 (dirup)
5. Push stone from pos44 to pos43 (dirleft)

But this adds four moves and a push. Total steps so far: initial moves (3) + first push (1) + second push (1) + four moves (4) + third push (1) = 10 actions.

But maybe there's a smarter way. Let's see:

After the stone is at pos44, agent is at pos34. From pos34, agent can move dirup to pos33 (step 6), then dirright to pos43 (step7). Now, agent is at pos43. From here, how to reach pos54? Maybe:

From pos43, move dirdown to pos53 (row5, column3?), but according to movement rules, from pos43: "You may move from location pos43 to location pos33 following direction dirleft", "You may move from location pos43 to location pos53 following direction dirright", "You may move from location pos43 to location pos42 following direction dirup", "You may move from location pos43 to location pos44 following direction dirdown".

So moving dirright from pos43 to pos53 (row5, column3). Then, from pos53, dirdown to pos54 (row5, column4). Then, from pos54, push west to pos44 to pos43.

Wait, but the stone is at pos44. So pushing from pos44 to pos43 requires the agent to be at pos54 (east of pos44) and push west (dirleft).

So action: pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos54 pos44 pos43 dirleft.

So steps:

6. pos34 → pos33 (dirup)
7. pos33 → pos43 (dirright)
8. pos43 → pos53 (dirright)
9. pos53 → pos54 (dirdown)
10. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos54 pos44 pos43 dirleft

That's five more actions after the second push. Total actions: 4 (initial) +1 (first push) +1 (second push) +5 (steps 6-10) = 11 actions. Still too long.

Is there a shorter path? Let's think differently. Maybe after the first push to pos34, instead of pushing to pos44, the agent can push the stone south to pos35.

Wait, pushing from pos34 to pos35 (dirdown). That would require the agent to be at pos34's north neighbor (pos24), pushing south. But the agent is at pos24 after the first push. So direction d would be dirright (from pos24 to pos34), then pushing south (dirdown) to pos35. But the action requires that the direction from the agent to the stone is the same as the direction the stone is pushed. Wait, no. The push direction is the same as the direction from the agent to the stone. So if the agent is north of the stone (pos24), and the stone is at pos34, then the direction is dirright. To push the stone south (dirdown), the agent needs to be north of the stone, and the stone moves in the same direction as the agent's direction to the stone. So no, that's not possible. The push direction is determined by the direction from the agent to the stone. So if the agent is north of the stone (pos24) and the stone is at pos34, then the direction is dirright. So pushing the stone would be in the same direction, dirright, which would take it to pos44. So that's what we did before.

So no, can't push south from pos34.

Alternative idea: after the first push to pos34, the agent is at pos24. From there, the agent can move to pos25 (dirdown), then to pos35 (dirright), then to pos45 (dirright), then to pos44 (dirup). But pos44 has the stone after the second push. Wait, no. After first push, stone is at pos34. Agent is at pos24. So agent moves to pos25 (dirdown), then pos35 (dirright), then pos45 (dirright), then pos44 (dirup). Now, agent is at pos44. The stone is at pos34. From here, can the agent push the stone east to pos44 (dirright from pos34). So agent needs to be at pos34's west neighbor (pos24) to push east. But the agent is at pos44, which is east of pos34. So no.

This is really challenging. Maybe the optimal plan has three pushes and several moves. Let's try to outline the minimal steps.

Alternative approach:

Agent needs to push the stone three times: pos24 → pos34 → pos44 → pos43.

Each push requires certain moves:

1. pos11 → pos12 → pos13 → pos14 → push to pos34 (4 actions)
2. pos24 → push to pos44 (5th action)
3. Agent moves to pos54 (4 actions), push to pos43 (6th action)

But that's 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 10 actions. Not optimal.

Alternatively, is there a way to reach pos54 faster?

After the second push, agent is at pos34. From there, move to pos35 (dirdown), pos45 (dirright), pos55 (dirright), pos54 (dirup). That's four moves. Then push. So steps: initial 4, push1, push2, 4 moves, push3. Total 4+1+1+4+1=11.

But the user says to provide an optimal plan with minimal steps. So perhaps there's a shorter path.

Wait, after the second push, the stone is at pos44. The agent is at pos34. Can the agent move from pos34 to pos44 (dirright)? But pos44 has the stone. So no. But wait, after the second push, the stone is at pos44, and the agent is at pos34. Then, pos44 is not clear (stone is there), so agent can't move there.

Hmm. Another idea: after the first push to pos34, the agent is at pos24. Then, instead of pushing to pos44, can the agent push the stone up to pos33 (dirleft), then left to pos32, etc. But pos33 is not a goal.

No, because the goal is pos43. So that's not helpful.

Alternatively, after the first push to pos34, the agent is at pos24. Then, move to pos23 (dirdown), then pos22 (dirdown), then pos21 (dirdown), then pos31 (dirright), then pos41 (dirright), then pos51 (dirright), then pos52 (dirdown), etc. This seems way too long.

I'm stuck. Let's think again: the stone needs to reach pos43. The only goal is pos43. The agent must push it there. The shortest path for the stone is pos24 → pos34 → pos44 → pos43. Three pushes.

The agent's path to enable these pushes:

First push: agent at pos14, push to pos34.

Second push: agent at pos24, push to pos44.

Third push: agent at pos54, push to pos43.

So the agent needs to reach pos54 after the second push.

The steps would be:

1. Move from pos11 to pos12 (dirdown)
2. Move to pos13 (dirdown)
3. Move to pos14 (dirdown)
4. Push to pos34 (action 4)
5. Agent is now at pos24. Move to pos25 (dirdown)
6. Move to pos35 (dirright)
7. Move to pos45 (dirright)
8. Move to pos55 (dirright)
9. Move to pos54 (dirup)
10. Push to pos43 (action 10)

But this totals 10 actions. Is there a way to reduce this?

Wait, after the second push (stone at pos44, agent at pos34), can the agent move directly from pos34 to pos44? No, because the stone is there. So no.

Wait, another idea: after the second push, the agent is at pos34. From there, move to pos35 (dirdown), then pos45 (dirright), then pos44 (dirup). But pos44 has the stone, so agent can't move there. So no.

Alternatively, from pos34, move to pos35 (dirdown), then pos45 (dirright), then pos55 (dirright), then pos54 (dirup). That's four moves, then push. So steps after second push: 4 moves + push. Total steps: 4 (initial moves) +1 (push1) +1 (push2) +4 (moves) +1 (push3) = 11 actions.

But maybe there's a shorter path. For example, after the first push, agent is at pos24. Instead of moving to pos25, maybe move dirright to pos34. But pos34 has the stone, so no. Or move up to pos23.

Alternatively, after the first push, agent is at pos24. From there, he can move to pos23 (dirup), then pos22 (dirup), pos21 (dirup), pos31 (dirright), pos41 (dirright), pos51 (dirright), pos52 (dirdown), pos53 (dirdown), pos54 (dirdown). Then push. But that's 7 moves plus the push. Total actions: 4 +1 +7 +1 = 13, which is worse.

So perhaps the minimal plan is 10 actions. But I'm not sure. Maybe there's a smarter way.

Wait, after the second push, the agent is at pos34. From there, can he move to pos33 (dirup), then pos43 (dirright). Then, he is at pos43. From there, he can move to pos53 (dirright), then pos54 (dirdown). Then push. So steps after second push:

6. pos34 → pos33 (dirup)
7. pos33 → pos43 (dirright)
8. pos43 → pos53 (dirright)
9. pos53 → pos54 (dirdown)
10. Push stone from pos44 to pos43.

That's four moves and one push (5 steps). So total steps: 4 (initial) +1 (push1) +1 (push2) +4 (moves) +1 (push3) = 11 actions.

Still 11. Is there any way to make it shorter?

Wait, after the first push, agent is at pos24. From there, he can move to pos25 (dirdown), then pos35 (dirright), then pos45 (dirright), then pos55 (dirright), then pos54 (dirup). That's four moves. Then push. So steps:

1. pos11 → pos12
2. pos12 → pos13
3. pos13 → pos14
4. push to pos34
5. pos24 → pos25
6. pos25 → pos35
7. pos35 → pos45
8. pos45 → pos55
9. pos55 → pos54
10. push to pos43

Total actions: 10. That's better. So steps 1-4 are the first four actions. Then steps 5-9 are five moves to get to pos54. Then step 10 is the push. So total 10 actions.

Yes, this seems shorter. So the plan would be:

move player1 pos11 pos12 dirdown

move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown

move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown

pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos14 pos24 pos34 dirright

move player1 pos24 pos25 dirdown

move player1 pos25 pos35 dirright

move player1 pos35 pos45 dirright

move player1 pos45 pos55 dirright

move player1 pos55 pos54 dirup

pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos54 pos44 pos43 dirleft

This totals 10 actions. Now, check if all preconditions are met.

Let's verify each action:

1. move player1 pos11 pos12 dirdown: agent is at pos11, pos12 is clear. Yes.

2. move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown: agent at pos12, pos13 clear.

3. move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown: agent at pos13, pos14 clear.

4. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos14 pos24 pos34 dirright: agent at pos14, stone at pos24, pos34 clear. Direction from pos14 to pos24 is dirright. Can move from pos14 to pos24 following dirright? According to movement rules: "You may move from location pos14 to location pos24 following direction dirright". Yes. pos34 is clear initially. Then, after this action, agent moves to pos24, stone moves to pos34.

5. move player1 pos24 pos25 dirdown: pos24 is now agent's location, pos25 is clear? Original state says pos25 is clear. After previous actions, yes.

6. move player1 pos25 pos35 dirright: pos25 to pos35 (dirright). Check movement rules: "You may move from location pos25 to location pos35 following direction dirright". Yes.

7. move player1 pos35 pos45 dirright: pos35 to pos45 (dirright). Movement rule: "You may move from location pos35 to location pos45 following direction dirright". Yes.

8. move player1 pos45 pos55 dirright: pos45 to pos55 dirright. Movement rule: "You may move from location pos45 to location pos55 following direction dirright". Yes.

9. move player1 pos55 pos54 dirup: pos55 to pos54 dirup. Movement rule: "You may move from location pos55 to location pos54 following direction dirup". Yes.

10. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos54 pos44 pos43 dirleft: agent at pos54, stone at pos44, pos43 is a goal. Check preconditions:

- agent is at pos54: yes.

- stone is at pos44: yes.

- pos43 is clear: initially pos43 is a goal and clear? Original state says pos43 is a goal and other locations are clear. After previous steps, pos43 should be clear.

- can move from pos54 to pos44 following dirleft: check movement rules. "You may move from location pos54 to location pos44 following direction dirleft". Yes.

- can move from pos44 to pos43 following dirleft: check movement rules. "You may move from location pos44 to location pos34 following direction dirleft" (no), but pos44 to pos43 is dirleft? Let's check: pos44 is row4, column4. dirleft would decrease the row by 1, leading to row3, column4 (pos34). Wait, no. According to movement rules, from pos44: "You may move from location pos44 to location pos34 following direction dirleft", "You may move from location pos44 to location pos54 following direction dirright", "You may move from location pos44 to location pos43 following direction dirup", "You may move from location pos44 to location pos45 following direction dirdown".

Ah, to move from pos44 to pos43, the direction is dirup. Because pos43 is row4, column3. So dirup from pos44 would decrease the column by 1, so pos44 (row4, column4) → pos43 (row4, column3) via dirup.

So the direction from pos44 to pos43 is dirup. Therefore, the action pushtogoal requires that the direction from the agent's location (pos54) to the stone's location (pos44) is dirleft, and then the stone is pushed in the same direction to pos43. Wait, no. The direction in the action is the direction from the agent's position to the stone's current position. So the agent is at pos54, stone at pos44. The direction from pos54 to pos44 is dirleft (since pos54 is row5, column4; pos44 is row4, column4. Moving left (dirleft) would decrease the row by 1. So dirleft from pos54 to pos44. Then, pushing the stone dirleft would take it to pos34. But we want to push it to pos43. So there's a mistake here. 

Ah, this is the error. The direction from pos54 to pos44 is dirleft (row5 to row4). Pushing the stone in dirleft would take it to pos34 (row4-1=row3, column4). But we need to push it to pos43 (row4, column3). So this approach is wrong. Therefore, the plan is invalid.

This means that the previous approach is incorrect. The agent can't push the stone from pos44 to pos43 using dirleft from pos54. Instead, the direction to push would be dirup, which decreases the column by 1. So to push the stone dirup from pos44 to pos43, the agent must be south of pos44 (pos45), because the direction from pos45 to pos44 is dirup (column4 to column4, but wait, that's not right. This is getting really confusing.

Let me clarify the directions again. The directions are defined by the movement rules. For example, from pos44, you can move dirup to pos43. So dirup from pos44 is to pos43. Therefore, to push the stone from pos44 to pos43 (dirup), the agent must be at pos45 (south of pos44), and the direction from pos45 to pos44 is dirup. So the action would be pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos45 pos44 pos43 dirup.

But in this case, the agent needs to be at pos45. So after the second push (stone at pos44), the agent is at pos34. To reach pos45, the agent needs to move:

pos34 → pos35 (dirdown)

pos35 → pos45 (dirright)

Then, push.

So steps after second push:

5. move player1 pos34 pos35 dirdown

6. move player1 pos35 pos45 dirright

7. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos45 pos44 pos43 dirup

This would be three actions. So total steps:

1-4: 4 actions

5-7: 3 actions

Total 7 actions. But does this work?

Let's verify:

After step4, stone is at pos34, agent at pos24.

Step5: move from pos24 to pos25 (dirdown) — wait, after step4, agent is at pos24. Step5 is move from pos24 to pos25 (dirdown). Possible? Yes, because pos25 is clear.

Step6: move from pos25 to pos35 (dirright)

Step7: move from pos35 to pos45 (dirright)

Step8: pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos45 pos44 pos43 dirup

Wait, but after step4, the agent is at pos24. Then steps:

5. move player1 pos24 pos25 dirdown

6. move player1 pos25 pos35 dirright

7. move player1 pos35 pos45 dirright

8. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos45 pos44 pos43 dirup

So four actions after step4, totaling 8 actions.

But in this case, after the second push, the stone is at pos44. Wait, no. The second push is from pos34 to pos44. So after step4 (first push), the stone is at pos34. Then, how does it get to pos44?

Ah, this approach skips the second push. So this is a different plan.

Wait, no. Let me re-express:

Alternative plan:

1. Agent moves to pos14 and pushes stone to pos34.

2. Then, agent moves to pos24 → pos25 → pos35 → pos45.

3. Then, push stone from pos34 to pos44.

Wait, no. The stone is at pos34 after first push. To push it to pos44, agent must be at pos34's west neighbor (pos24), pushing dirright. So the second push would be:

pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos34 pos44 dirright

Then, stone is at pos44. Agent is at pos34.

Then, agent moves to pos35 → pos45.

Then, push from pos44 to pos43.

So steps:

1. move to pos14 (3 moves)

2. push to pos34 (action4)

3. move to pos24 → pos25 → pos35 → pos45 (3 moves, actions5-7)

4. push from pos45 to pos44 to pos43 (action8)

But wait, the agent is at pos45. To push the stone from pos44 to pos43 (dirup), the agent must be south of pos44 (pos45), direction dirup from pos45 to pos44. So action: pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos45 pos44 pos43 dirup.

But how does the stone get to pos44? After the first push, it's at pos34. Then, agent needs to push it to pos44. So the steps would be:

1. move player1 pos11 pos12 dirdown

2. move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown

3. move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown

4. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos14 pos24 pos34 dirright

5. move player1 pos24 pos25 dirdown

6. move player1 pos25 pos35 dirright

7. move player1 pos35 pos45 dirright

8. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos45 pos44 pos43 dirup

But wait, after step4, the stone is at pos34. So step8 requires the stone to be at pos44. So this plan is missing the push from pos34 to pos44. Therefore, this plan is invalid.

So the correct steps are:

1. move to pos14 and push to pos34 (4 actions)

2. push from pos34 to pos44 (action5)

3. move to pos45 (actions6-7)

4. push from pos44 to pos43 (action8)

So:

1. move player1 pos11 pos12 dirdown

2. move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown

3. move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown

4. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos14 pos24 pos34 dirright

5. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos34 pos44 dirright

6. move player1 pos34 pos35 dirdown

7. move player1 pos35 pos45 dirright

8. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos45 pos44 pos43 dirup

Total actions: 8.

This seems better. Let's verify each step:

Step4: after pushing, agent is at pos24, stone at pos34.

Step5: push from pos34 to pos44. Agent is at pos24, direction dirright (from pos24 to pos34). The stone moves to pos44. Agent moves to pos34.

Step6: move from pos34 to pos35 (dirdown)

Step7: move from pos35 to pos45 (dirright)

Step8: push from pos44 to pos43. Agent at pos45, direction dirup (from pos45 to pos44). Stone moves to pos43 (goal).

This works. So the total actions are 8.

Let's check preconditions for each action:

Step5: pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos34 pos44 dirright

- Agent is at pos24: yes.

- Stone is at pos34: yes.

- pos44 is clear: initially, yes.

- Can move from pos24 to pos34 following dirright: yes (movement rule: pos24 to pos34 is dirright).

- Can move from pos34 to pos44 following dirright: yes (movement rule: pos34 to pos44 is dirright).

- pos44 is a goal? No. Wait, pos44 is not a goal location. The problem states that pos43 is the only goal. So this action is invalid because pushtogoal requires that the destination is a goal. Therefore, this action cannot be used here. Oops! Mistake here.

Ah, this is a critical error. The action pushtogoal requires that the destination (l_to) is a goal location. So step5 is invalid because pos44 is not a goal. Therefore, we cannot use pushtogoal here. We must use pushtonongoal instead.

But pushtonongoal requires that the destination is not a goal. pos44 is not a goal. So the correct action is pushtonongoal.

But then, after step5, the stone is at pos44 (non-goal). Then, in step8, we need to push it to pos43 (goal), so use pushtogoal.

So revised steps:

Step4: pushtogoal (stone to pos34, which is not a goal, but wait, no. pos34 is not a goal. Oh no! pos43 is the only goal. So pushing the stone to pos34 is also to a non-goal. So step4 should be pushtonongoal.

But wait, the problem's goal is to have the stone at any goal location. The only goal is pos43. So all other pushes must be to non-goals until the final push to pos43.

So the actions should be:

Step4: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos14 pos24 pos34 dirright

Step5: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos34 pos44 dirright

Step8: pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos45 pos44 pos43 dirup

This way, all pushes except the last one are to non-goals.

But wait, the preconditions for pushtonongoal require that the destination is a non-goal. pos34 is a non-goal (since the only goal is pos43). pos44 is a non-goal. pos43 is a goal.

So the revised plan:

1. move player1 pos11 pos12 dirdown

2. move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown

3. move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown

4. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos14 pos24 pos34 dirright

5. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos34 pos44 dirright

6. move player1 pos34 pos35 dirdown

7. move player1 pos35 pos45 dirright

8. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos45 pos44 pos43 dirup

Total of 8 actions.

Check preconditions for each action:

Step4: pushtonongoal

- agent at pos14: yes.

- stone at pos24: yes.

- pos34 is clear: yes.

- Can move from pos14 to pos24 dirright: yes.

- Can move from pos24 to pos34 dirright: yes.

- pos34 is non-goal: yes.

After step4: agent at pos24, stone at pos34.

Step5: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos34 pos44 dirright

- agent at pos24: yes.

- stone at pos34: yes.

- pos44 clear: yes.

- Can move from pos24 to pos34 dirright: yes.

- Can move from pos34 to pos44 dirright: yes.

- pos44 is non-goal: yes.

After step5: agent at pos34, stone at pos44.

Step6: move player1 pos34 pos35 dirdown

- pos34 is clear (after agent leaves): yes.

- pos35 is clear: yes.

Step7: move player1 pos35 pos45 dirright

- pos35 to pos45: yes.

Step8: pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos45 pos44 pos43 dirup

- agent at pos45: yes.

- stone at pos44: yes.

- pos43 clear: yes.

- Can move from pos45 to pos44 dirup: yes (movement rule: pos45 to pos44 dirup? Let's check movement rules for pos45: "You may move from location pos45 to location pos35 following direction dirleft", "You may move from location pos45 to location pos55 following direction dirright", "You may move from location pos45 to location pos44 following direction dirup", "You may move from location pos45 to location pos55 following direction dirdown". Wait, movement from pos45 to pos44 is dirup. Yes.

- Can move from pos44 to pos43 dirup: movement rule for pos44: "You may move from location pos44 to location pos43 following direction dirup". Yes.

- pos43 is goal: yes.

After this, stone is at pos43, which is the goal.

So this plan should work. Total of 8 actions. This seems optimal.
