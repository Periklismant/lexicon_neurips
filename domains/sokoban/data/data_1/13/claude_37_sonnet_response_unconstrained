Let me break down the problem:

1. We have a 2D grid (5x5) with positions labeled as pos11, pos12, ..., pos55.
2. Each position can contain the agent (player1), a stone (stone1), or be empty.
3. Positions are either goal or non-goal positions.
4. The agent can move around the grid or push stones.
5. The task is to move the stone to a goal location.

Initially:
- player1 is at pos24
- stone1 is at pos43
- pos13 is a goal location

Let me visualize the initial grid:

```
1 [ ][ ][G][ ][ ]
2 [ ][ ][ ][P][ ]
3 [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]
4 [ ][ ][S][ ][ ]
5 [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]
```

where P represents the player, S represents the stone, and G represents a goal position.

The goal is to move the stone to pos13.

To solve this problem, I need to:
1. Move the player to a position where it can push the stone (adjacent to the stone).
2. Push the stone towards the goal.

Let's think step by step:

First, let's determine where the player needs to be to push the stone towards the goal.

The stone is at pos43. To push it towards pos13, the player needs to be able to move it up and left. Since the stone can only be pushed (not pulled), the player needs to be on the opposite side of the desired direction.

Here's a path I'm considering:
1. Move the stone from pos43 to pos33 (up).
2. Move the stone from pos33 to pos23 (up).
3. Move the stone from pos23 to pos13 (up).

To do this, the player needs to:
1. Move to pos44 to push the stone from pos43 to pos33.
2. Move to pos34 to push the stone from pos33 to pos23.
3. Move to pos24 to push the stone from pos23 to pos13.

Now, let me trace the specific actions:

1. Initial state: player at pos24, stone at pos43.
2. I need to move the player to pos44 to push the stone up.
3. Then push the stone from pos43 to pos33.
4. Move the player to pos34.
5. Push the stone from pos33 to pos23.
6. Move the player to pos24.
7. Push the stone from pos23 to pos13 (a goal).

Let's detail the actions:

1. Move player1 from pos24 to pos34 (dirright)
2. Move player1 from pos34 to pos44 (dirright)
3. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos43 pos33 dirleft (push up)
4. Move player1 from pos43 to pos33 (dirup)
5. Move player1 from pos33 to pos34 (dirdown)
6. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos33 pos23 dirleft (push up)
7. Move player1 from pos33 to pos23 (dirup)
8. Move player1 from pos23 to pos24 (dirdown)
9. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos23 pos13 dirleft (push up)

Actually, the directions in the actions are a bit confusing. Let me re-interpret them:

The direction in the action seems to indicate the direction from the source to the destination:
- If you move from pos24 to pos34, you're moving right (dirright).
- If you move from pos34 to pos44, you're moving right (dirright).
- If you push from pos43 to pos33, the player is at pos44, so the stone is moved up (the player pushes the stone from pos43, and the player is on the right of the stone, so the push direction is left).

Let me re-check my reasoning:

For the pushtogoal and pushtonongoal actions, the direction specifies how to get from the player's position to the stone's position, and then from the stone's position to the destination.

1. "pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": This means agent p, situated at location l_p, pushes stone s from location l_from to goal location l_to, following direction d.

So, for the action pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos43 pos33 dirleft, I need to check:
- Is player1 at pos44? Yes.
- Is stone1 at pos43? Yes.
- Can I get from pos44 to pos43 following dirleft? Let's check the given constraints:
  "You may move from location pos44 to location pos43 following direction dirup"
  It seems we need to use dirup, not dirleft.

Actually, wait. The directions in the given constraints seem to follow a different convention than what I initially understood. Let me re-interpret:

- dirleft means moving left (decreasing the first coordinate).
- dirright means moving right (increasing the first coordinate).
- dirup means moving up (decreasing the second coordinate).
- dirdown means moving down (increasing the second coordinate).

Given this, let's visualize the grid again:

```
   1  2  3  4  5
1 [  ][  ][G][  ][  ]
2 [  ][  ][  ][P][  ]
3 [  ][  ][  ][  ][  ]
4 [  ][  ][S][  ][  ]
5 [  ][  ][  ][  ][  ]
```

Here, the player is at (2, 4) (or pos24) and the stone is at (4, 3) (or pos43). The goal is at (1, 3) (or pos13).

Now, I need to determine the directions again:

1. The player at pos24 needs to move to pos34 to be closer to the stone. The direction from pos24 to pos34 is dirright.
2. The player then moves from pos34 to pos44 to be to the right of the stone. The direction is dirright.
3. The player then pushes the stone from pos43 to pos33. Since the player is at pos44 and the stone is at pos43, the direction from pos44 to pos43 is dirleft.
4. After pushing, the player is at pos43 and the stone is at pos33.
5. The player moves from pos43 to pos33 and then to pos34 to prepare for the next push.
6. From pos34, the player pushes the stone from pos33 to pos23. The direction from pos34 to pos33 is dirleft.
7. After pushing, the player is at pos33 and the stone is at pos23.
8. The player moves from pos33 to pos23 and then to pos24 to prepare for the next push.
9. From pos24, the player pushes the stone from pos23 to pos13 (a goal). The direction from pos24 to pos23 is dirleft.

Wait, I think I misinterpreted the grid coordinates. Let me rethink.

The grid coordinates are (row, col), so pos24 means row 2, col 4. Therefore, pos13 means row 1, col 3.

Redrawing the grid with this understanding:

```
   1  2  3  4  5
1 [  ][  ][G][  ][  ]
2 [  ][  ][  ][P][  ]
3 [  ][  ][  ][  ][  ]
4 [  ][  ][S][  ][  ]
5 [  ][  ][  ][  ][  ]
```

With this clarification, the player is at pos24 (row 2, col 4) and the stone is at pos43 (row 4, col 3). The goal is at pos13 (row 1, col 3).

So, the path for the stone would be:
pos43 (row 4, col 3) -> pos33 (row 3, col 3) -> pos23 (row 2, col 3) -> pos13 (row 1, col 3)

This makes the plan I sketched earlier correct. Let me detail the actions again:

1. Move player1 from pos24 to pos34 (dirdown): This takes the player one step down, from row 2 to row 3. Direction dirdown means increasing the row.
2. Move player1 from pos34 to pos44 (dirdown): Another step down, from row 3 to row 4. Direction is dirdown.
3. Move player1 from pos44 to pos43 (dirleft): Move one step left, from col 4 to col 3. Direction is dirleft.
4. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos43 pos33 dirup: Wait, this doesn't make sense. The player is at pos43 and the stone is at pos43, which is a contradiction.

I made a mistake in my understanding of the initial state. Let me go back to the original problem:

Initial state:
- player1 is at pos24
- stone1 is at pos43

Oh, I think I might be misinterpreting the naming convention. Let's be explicit:

pos24 means row 2, col 4.
pos43 means row 4, col 3.

And the directions:
- dirdown means increasing the row (moving down).
- dirup means decreasing the row (moving up).
- dirright means increasing the col (moving right).
- dirleft means decreasing the col (moving left).

Given this, in our 5x5 grid:
- player1 is at row 2, col 4.
- stone1 is at row 4, col 3.
- The goal is at row 1, col 3.

Let's visualize the grid again:

```
     1   2   3   4   5
1 | [ ] [ ] [G] [ ] [ ]
2 | [ ] [ ] [ ] [P] [ ]
3 | [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ]
4 | [ ] [ ] [S] [ ] [ ]
5 | [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ]
```

To get the stone to the goal, the player needs to push it from row 4, col 3 to row 1, col 3, which means pushing it upwards.

To push the stone upwards, the player needs to be below it. So, the player needs to move to row 5, col 3 (or pos53) and then push the stone upwards. But first, the player needs to get to row 5, col 3.

From the player's current position (row 2, col 4), a path to row 5, col 3 might be:
- Move down from row 2, col 4 to row 3, col 4.
- Move down from row 3, col 4 to row 4, col 4.
- Move down from row 4, col 4 to row 5, col 4.
- Move left from row 5, col 4 to row 5, col 3.

Then, the player can push the stone from row 4, col 3 to row 3, col 3, and so on, until the stone reaches row 1, col 3.

Actually, let's reason step by step to find a solution. I might be stuck in details.

I need to bring the stone (at pos43) to the goal (at pos13). To do this, I need to push the stone. The rules for pushing are:
- To push a stone, the player must be adjacent to it.
- The push direction is determined by the player's position relative to the stone.

For example, to push the stone up, the player must be below the stone.

From the initial positions, let's determine the optimal path:

1. Player is at pos24, Stone is at pos43.
2. To push the stone upward, I need to first position the player below the stone (row 5, col 3).
3. To get to row 5, col 3, the player can:
   a. Move down from pos24 to pos34.
   b. Move down from pos34 to pos44.
   c. Move down from pos44 to pos54.
   d. Move left from pos54 to pos53.
4. From pos53, the player can push the stone upward from pos43 to pos33.
5. After pushing, the player is at pos43 and the stone is at pos33.
6. To push the stone from pos33 to pos23, the player needs to be below it (at pos43).
7. From pos43, the player pushes the stone upward from pos33 to pos23.
8. After pushing, the player is at pos33 and the stone is at pos23.
9. To push the stone from pos23 to pos13, the player needs to be below it (at pos33).
10. From pos33, the player pushes the stone upward from pos23 to pos13.
11. After pushing, the player is at pos23 and the stone is at pos13, which is a goal.

Let me list the plan:

1. Move player1 from pos24 to pos34 (dirdown)
2. Move player1 from pos34 to pos44 (dirdown)
3. Move player1 from pos44 to pos54 (dirdown)
4. Move player1 from pos54 to pos53 (dirleft)
5. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos53 pos43 pos33 dirup
6. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos33 pos23 dirup
7. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos23 pos13 dirup

Actually, I keep changing the interpretation of the directions. Visually, the grid looks like this:

```
     1   2   3   4   5
1 | [ ] [ ] [G] [ ] [ ]
2 | [ ] [ ] [ ] [P] [ ]
3 | [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ]
4 | [ ] [ ] [S] [ ] [ ]
5 | [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ]
```

To move from pos24 (player's position) to pos34, we're moving DOWN (increasing the row), which is dirdown.

This confirms the directions:
- dirdown means increasing the row (moving down).
- dirup means decreasing the row (moving up).
- dirright means increasing the col (moving right).
- dirleft means decreasing the col (moving left).

Let's also confirm the push directions:
The push direction specifies how to move from the player's position to the stone's position, and then from the stone's position to the target.

For example, when the player is at pos53 and wants to push the stone from pos43 to pos33, the player is ABOVE the stone. To get from the player's position to the stone's position, we need to go UP (decreasing the row). So the direction is dirup.

I think my final plan is correct:

1. Move player1 from pos24 to pos34 (dirdown)
2. Move player1 from pos34 to pos44 (dirdown)
3. Move player1 from pos44 to pos54 (dirdown)
4. Move player1 from pos54 to pos53 (dirleft)
5. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos53 pos43 pos33 dirup
6. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos33 pos23 dirup
7. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos23 pos13 dirup

Actually, one issue with this plan is that I need to check if the given constraints have the relationships between positions that I've assumed.

Let me double-check the direction relationships:

From the list of available moves, we have:
"You may move from location pos24 to location pos14 following direction dirleft"
This means moving from pos24 to pos14 is considered moving left (dirleft).

But also:
"You may move from location pos24 to location pos23 following direction dirup"
This means moving from pos24 to pos23 is considered moving up (dirup).

So, pos14 is to the left of pos24, and pos23 is above (or up from) pos24. This seems to align with my understanding of the coordinates.

Now, with the direction relationships confirmed, I'm reconfirming the relations from my plan:

1. To move from pos24 to pos34, we're moving down (increasing the row), which is dirdown.
2. To move from pos34 to pos44, we're moving down (increasing the row), which is dirdown.
3. To move from pos44 to pos54, we're moving down (increasing the row), which is dirdown.
4. To move from pos54 to pos53, we're moving left (decreasing the col), which is dirleft.
5. To push from pos53 to pos43, we're moving up (decreasing the row), which is dirup.
6. To push from pos43 to pos33, we're moving up (decreasing the row), which is dirup.
7. To push from pos33 to pos23, we're moving up (decreasing the row), which is dirup.
8. To push from pos23 to pos13, we're moving up (decreasing the row), which is dirup.

Actually, let's check if we really need a pushtonongoal action or a pushtogoal action when we're pushing to a non-goal location. Let's check the preconditions:

For "pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": One of the preconditions is "(vi) location l_to is a goal location."
For "pushtonongoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": One of the preconditions is "(vi) location l_to is not a goal location."

So, we need to use pushtonongoal when pushing to a non-goal location and pushtogoal when pushing to a goal location.

From the original problem, the goal location is pos13. So, when pushing to pos13, we need to use pushtogoal. For all other locations, we need to use pushtonongoal.

In my plan, the final push (from pos23 to pos13) is to a goal location, so we need to use pushtogoal.

Ok, so I think my final plan is correct:

1. Move player1 from pos24 to pos34 (dirdown)
2. Move player1 from pos34 to pos44 (dirdown)
3. Move player1 from pos44 to pos54 (dirdown)
4. Move player1 from pos54 to pos53 (dirleft)
5. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos53 pos43 pos33 dirup
6. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos33 pos23 dirup
7. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos23 pos13 dirup

Let me check the constraints for each action:

1. "move player1 pos24 pos34 dirdown":
   - Is player1 at pos24? Yes, from the initial state.
   - Is pos34 clear? Yes, from the initial state.
   - Can we get from pos24 to pos34 following dirdown? Let me check.
     From the original description, we have: "You may move from location pos24 to location pos34 following direction dirright".
     This is different from what I expected. It seems the naming of directions doesn't match my interpretation. Let me re-evaluate.

Hmm this is a bit confusing. From the data, it looks like the directions are named more based on the naming convention of the positions; it's not about the actual "up", "down", "left", "right" as I interpreted earlier.

From pos24 to pos34, we're moving from a location with a 2 to a location with a 3, which seems to be named dirright. This suggests that the first digit in the position determines the direction. If the first digit increases, it's dirright. If it decreases, it's dirleft. Similarly for the second digit with dirup and dirdown.

But then there's this entry: "You may move from location pos24 to location pos23 following direction dirup".
From pos24 to pos23, we're moving from a position with a 4 to a position with a 3, so the second digit is decreasing. This is named dirup.

So, it seems the directions are relative to the position naming:
- dirright: First digit increases.
- dirleft: First digit decreases.
- dirdown: Second digit increases.
- dirup: Second digit decreases.

Let me re-evaluate my plan with this understanding.

Wait, I have to think again. The grid is defined as:
pos11 pos12 pos13 pos14 pos15
pos21 pos22 pos23 pos24 pos25
pos31 pos32 pos33 pos34 pos35
pos41 pos42 pos43 pos44 pos45
pos51 pos52 pos53 pos54 pos55

Which means the coordinates are (row, col).

Looking at the given constraints for moves:
"You may move from location pos24 to location pos34 following direction dirright".
From pos24 (2, 4) to pos34 (3, 4), we're increasing the row, which is named dirright.

"You may move from location pos24 to location pos23 following direction dirup".
From pos24 (2, 4) to pos23 (2, 3), we're decreasing the col, which is named dirup.

So, the directions are:
- dirright: Row increases (Moving down).
- dirleft: Row decreases (Moving up).
- dirdown: Col increases (Moving right).
- dirup: Col decreases (Moving left).

But this contradicts other entries like "You may move from location pos12 to location pos11 following direction dirup", where from pos12 (1, 2) to pos11 (1, 1), the col is decreasing, which is named dirup.

Wait, I think I understand now. 
- dirleft: decrease the first digit (move to the left in the grid, or decrease row)
- dirright: increase the first digit (move to the right in the grid, or increase row)
- dirup: decrease the second digit (move up in the grid, or decrease col)
- dirdown: increase the second digit (move down in the grid, or increase col)

So the grid should be:
pos11 pos21 pos31 pos41 pos51
pos12 pos22 pos32 pos42 pos52
pos13 pos23 pos33 pos43 pos53
pos14 pos24 pos34 pos44 pos54
pos15 pos25 pos35 pos45 pos55

Let's visualize the initial state:

```
     1   2   3   4   5
1 | [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ]
2 | [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ]
3 | [G] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ]
4 | [ ] [ ] [ ] [P] [ ]
5 | [ ] [ ] [S] [ ] [ ]
```

No, this is incorrect because the goal is at pos13, and the original problem says the player is at pos24 and the stone is at pos43.

Let me go back to the original problem to make sure:
- "player1 is at location pos24"
- "stone1 is at location pos43"
- "pos13 is a goal location"

In a 5x5 grid, pos24 would be at row 2, col 4, pos43 would be at row 4, col 3, and pos13 would be at row 1, col 3.

I think my original grid visualization was correct:

```
     1   2   3   4   5
1 | [ ] [ ] [G] [ ] [ ]
2 | [ ] [ ] [ ] [P] [ ]
3 | [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ]
4 | [ ] [ ] [S] [ ] [ ]
5 | [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ]
```

Correcting my understanding:
- dirdown: Row increases (Moving down).
- dirup: Row decreases (Moving up).
- dirright: Col increases (Moving right).
- dirleft: Col decreases (Moving left).

This aligns with the natural interpretations of these directions.

With this, let's re-plan the solution:

1. Player is at pos24 (row 2, col 4), Stone is at pos43 (row 4, col 3).
2. To push the stone upward, we need to be below it. So, we need to move to pos53 (row 5, col 3).
3. From pos24:
   a. Move down from pos24 to pos34 (dirdown).
   b. Move down from pos34 to pos44 (dirdown).
   c. Move down from pos44 to pos54 (dirdown).
   d. Move left from pos54 to pos53 (dirleft).
4. From pos53, push the stone upward from pos43 to pos33 (dirup).
5. After pushing, the player is at pos43 and the stone is at pos33.
6. From pos43, push the stone upward from pos33 to pos23 (dirup).
7. After pushing, the player is at pos33 and the stone is at pos23.
8. From pos33, push the stone upward from pos23 to pos13 (dirup).
9. After pushing, the player is at pos23 and the stone is at pos13, which is a goal.

The plan is:

1. Move player1 pos24 pos34 dirdown
2. Move player1 pos34 pos44 dirdown
3. Move player1 pos44 pos54 dirdown
4. Move player1 pos54 pos53 dirleft
5. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos53 pos43 pos33 dirup
6. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos33 pos23 dirup
7. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos23 pos13 dirup

Ok, let me check in the list of allowed moves to make sure all of these steps are valid:

1. "Move player1 pos24 pos34 dirdown"
"You may move from location pos24 to location pos34 following direction dirright"
This seems to be a mismatch, but I think this is a naming inconsistency in the original problem.

Wait a second... I'm rethinking this. 
- From the list of allowed moves, we have: "You may move from location pos24 to location pos34 following direction dirright".
- This means from pos24 to pos34, the direction is dirright, not dirdown.

I need to reevaluate my understanding of the coordinates and directions.

I'm first going to check the list of allowable moves to see if there's a move from pos24 to pos34. From the given constraints:
"You may move from location pos24 to location pos34 following direction dirright".

So, the direction from pos24 to pos34, according to the given constraints, is dirright and not dirdown.

I'm guessing maybe the first number is the column, and the second number is the row? Let's re-check.

If the first digit of pos is column and the second digit is row, then:
- pos24 means col 2, row 4.
- pos34 means col 3, row 4.
- pos43 means col 4, row 3.
- pos13 means col 1, row 3.

And the directions would be:
- dirright: Col increases (Moving right).
- dirleft: Col decreases (Moving left).
- dirdown: Row increases (Moving down).
- dirup: Row decreases (Moving up).

Let's confirm with a few constraints:
"You may move from location pos24 to location pos34 following direction dirright":
From pos24 (col 2, row 4) to pos34 (col 3, row 4), we're moving right, which is dirright. This is consistent.

"You may move from location pos24 to location pos23 following direction dirup":
From pos24 (col 2, row 4) to pos23 (col 2, row 3), we're moving up, which is dirup. This is consistent.

This reinterpretation seems to align better with the given constraints. Let's visualize the grid again with this understanding:

```
     1   2   3   4   5 (columns)
1 | [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ]
2 | [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ]
3 | [G] [ ] [ ] [S] [ ]
4 | [ ] [P] [ ] [ ] [ ]
5 | [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ]
(rows)
```

Where P is the player at pos24 (col 2, row 4), S is the stone at pos43 (col 4, row 3), and G is the goal at pos13 (col 1, row 3).

So, to push the stone to the goal, the player needs to push it from the right side. This would require the player to be to the right of the stone, i.e., at pos53 (col 5, row 3). From pos24, the player would need to move to the right side of the stone.

Let's reconsider our plan:

1. From pos24 (col 2, row 4), the player moves to pos34 (col 3, row 4) using dirright.
2. From pos34, the player moves to pos35 (col 3, row 5) using dirdown.
3. From pos35, the player moves to pos45 (col 4, row 5) using dirright.
4. From pos45, the player moves to pos55 (col 5, row 5) using dirright.
5. From pos55, the player moves to pos54 (col 5, row 4) using dirup.
6. From pos54, the player moves to pos53 (col 5, row 3) using dirup.
7. From pos53, the player pushes the stone from pos43 to pos33 using dirleft.
8. From pos43, the player pushes the stone from pos33 to pos23 using dirleft.
9. From pos33, the player pushes the stone from pos23 to pos13 using dirleft.

Oh actually, in this case, there's a more direct route for the player to get to the right of the stone:

1. From pos24 (col 2, row 4), the player moves to pos34 (col 3, row 4) using dirright.
2. From pos34, the player moves to pos44 (col 4, row 4) using dirright.
3. From pos44, the player moves to pos43 (col 4, row 3) using dirup.
4. From pos43, the player pushes the stone from pos43 to pos33 using dirleft.
5. From pos43, the player pushes the stone from pos33 to pos23 using dirleft.
6. From pos33, the player pushes the stone from pos23 to pos13 using dirleft.

Wait, I made an error. From step 4, there's a logical inconsistency. In step 4, the player is at pos43, but the stone is also at pos43. This can't be right.

Let me reinterpret the initial conditions and start over.

Initial conditions:
- "player1 is at location pos24" (col 2, row 4)
- "stone1 is at location pos43" (col 4, row 3)

Redrawn grid:

```
     1   2   3   4   5 (columns)
1 | [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ]
2 | [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ]
3 | [G] [ ] [ ] [S] [ ]
4 | [ ] [P] [ ] [ ] [ ]
5 | [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ]
(rows)
```

Wait a second. I need to be careful about the order of the rows and columns. Let's rethink.

If I visualize the grid as a 2D array with the first digit being the row and the second digit being the column, then:
- pos24 means row 2, col 4.
- pos43 means row 4, col 3.
- pos13 means row 1, col 3.

This would give:

```
     1   2   3   4   5 (columns)
1 | [ ] [ ] [G] [ ] [ ]
2 | [ ] [ ] [ ] [P] [ ]
3 | [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ]
4 | [ ] [ ] [S] [ ] [ ]
5 | [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ]
(rows)
```

Let's verify with some of the allowed moves:
"You may move from location pos24 to location pos34 following direction dirright": From pos24 (row 2, col 4) to pos34 (row 3, col 4), we're moving from row 2 to row 3 (down), which is labeled as dirright.

"You may move from location pos24 to location pos23 following direction dirup": From pos24 (row 2, col 4) to pos23 (row 2, col 3), we're moving from col 4 to col 3 (left), which is labeled as dirup.

This still feels inconsistent with the natural meaning of the directions. Let me re-examine the original problem.

Actually, it's important to remember that this is a 2D grid, not a 2D array in programming, where the row and column are indices. In a real-world grid, we name the rows and columns from 1 to 5. 

Given the context, I believe the correct interpretation is:
- The first digit of "pos" is the row,
- The second digit is the column.

So, pos24 means row 2, col 4.

Verifying with allowed moves:
"You may move from location pos24 to location pos34 following direction dirright":
From pos24 (row 2, col 4) to pos34 (row 3, col 4), we're moving from row 2 to row 3 (increasing row or moving down). This is labeled as dirright.

"You may move from location pos24 to location pos23 following direction dirup":
From pos24 (row 2, col 4) to pos23 (row 2, col 3), we're moving from col 4 to col 3 (decreasing column or moving left). This is labeled as dirup.

The direction naming seems inconsistent with the physical directions, but this is the convention in the problem.

Redrawn grid with this interpretation:

```
     1   2   3   4   5 (columns)
1 | [ ] [ ] [G] [ ] [ ]
2 | [ ] [ ] [ ] [P] [ ]
3 | [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ]
4 | [ ] [ ] [S] [ ] [ ]
5 | [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ]
(rows)
```

So, the direction mappings would be:
- dirright: Increase row (Moving down).
- dirleft: Decrease row (Moving up).
- dirdown: Increase col (Moving right).
- dirup: Decrease col (Moving left).

Now, let's reconsider our plan:

1. From pos24 (row 2, col 4), the player moves to pos34 (row 3, col 4) using dirright (down).
2. From pos34, the player moves to pos44 (row 4, col 4) using dirright (down).
3. From pos44, the player moves to pos43 (row 4, col 3) using dirup (left).
4. From pos43, the player pushes the stone (which was at pos43) to pos33 (row 3, col 3) using dirleft (up). This doesn't seem right, because after the push, the player should be where the stone was, which is at pos43. But if the stone is at pos43, the player can't be there too.

I'm not quite following my own logic. Let me rethink the initial conditions again.

Initial conditions:
- "player1 is at location pos24" (row 2, col 4)
- "stone1 is at location pos43" (row 4, col 3)

Redrawn grid:

```
     1   2   3   4   5 (columns)
1 | [ ] [ ] [G] [ ] [ ]
2 | [ ] [ ] [ ] [P] [ ]
3 | [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ]
4 | [ ] [ ] [S] [ ] [ ]
5 | [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ]
(rows)
```

Alright, so the player is at pos24 (row 2, col 4), and the stone is at pos43 (row 4, col 3). The goal is to push the stone to pos13 (row 1, col 3).

To push the stone from pos43 to pos33 (row 3, col 3), the player needs to be on the adjacent side, which means the player should be at pos53 (row 5, col 3) to push it upwards.

From the player's current position (pos24), a path to pos53 would be:
1. From pos24 (row 2, col 4) to pos34 (row 3, col 4) using dirright (down).
2. From pos34 to pos44 (row 4, col 4) using dirright (down).
3. From pos44 to pos54 (row 5, col 4) using dirright (down).
4. From pos54 to pos53 (row 5, col 3) using dirup (left).

After reaching pos53, the player can start pushing the stone towards the goal:
5. From pos53, the player pushes the stone from pos43 to pos33 (row 3, col 3) using dirleft (up). After the push, the player is at pos43 and the stone is at pos33.
6. From pos43, the player pushes the stone from pos33 to pos23 (row 2, col 3) using dirleft (up). After the push, the player is at pos33 and the stone is at pos23.
7. From pos33, the player pushes the stone from pos23 to pos13 (row 1, col 3) using dirleft (up). After the push, the player is at pos23 and the stone is at pos13, which is a goal.

Let's double-check our actions from the original list of allowed actions:

1. "move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright" - This is valid as per "You may move from location pos24 to location pos34 following direction dirright".
2. "move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright" - This is valid as per "You may move from location pos34 to location pos44 following direction dirright".
3. "move player1 pos44 pos54 dirright" - This is valid as per "You may move from location pos44 to location pos54 following direction dirright".
4. "move player1 pos54 pos53 dirup" - This is valid as per "You may move from location pos54 to location pos53 following direction dirup".
5. "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos53 pos43 pos33 dirleft" - For this, we need to check if the player can get from pos53 to pos43 following dirleft, and if the player can get from pos43 to pos33 following dirleft. Checking the original allowed actions:
   - "You may move from location pos53 to location pos43 following direction dirleft".
   - "You may move from location pos43 to location pos33 following direction dirleft".
   So this action is valid.
6. "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos33 pos23 dirleft" - Similarly, we need to check:
   - "You may move from location pos43 to location pos33 following direction dirleft".
   - "You may move from location pos33 to location pos23 following direction dirleft".
   Both are valid, so this action is valid.
7. "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos23 pos13 dirleft" - We need to check:
   - "You may move from location pos33 to location pos23 following direction dirleft".
   - "You may move from location pos23 to location pos13 following direction dirleft".
   Both are valid, so this action is valid.

So, our final plan is:

1. move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright
2. move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright
3. move player1 pos44 pos54 dirright
4. move player1 pos54 pos53 dirup
5. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos53 pos43 pos33 dirleft
6. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos33 pos23 dirleft
7. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos23 pos13 dirleft

But I'm not convinced this is the most efficient plan. Let me try to think of a more direct approach.

Actually, I think this is the optimal solution. The goal is at pos13, and the stone is at pos43. The stone needs to be pushed up from row 4 to row 1. To push it upwards, the player needs to be below the stone. It's the most direct route to bring the stone to the goal.

So, the final optimal plan I propose is:

1. move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright
2. move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright
3. move player1 pos44 pos54 dirright
4. move player1 pos54 pos53 dirup
5. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos53 pos43 pos33 dirleft
6. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos33 pos23 dirleft
7. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos23 pos13 dirleft
