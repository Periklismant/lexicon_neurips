**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Move to Adjacent Position:** The agent starts at pos21 and moves down (dirdown) to pos22 to get next to the stone. However, since pos22 is initially clear (as per the problem's contradictory statement), this move is possible.

2. **Push Stone to pos23:** Using pushtonongoal, the agent at pos22 pushes the stone east (dirdown) to pos23.

3. **Push Stone to pos24:** The agent, now at pos23, pushes the stone further east (dirdown) to pos24.

4. **Push Stone to Goal pos34:** Finally, the agent moves south (dirright) to pos34 and pushes the stone from pos24 to the goal pos34 using pushtogoal.

This sequence efficiently moves the stone to the goal in four actions.
