Let me understand and solve this Sokoban-like puzzle. The setup is:

1. A 5x5 grid (positions pos11 through pos55)
2. A player (player1) initially at position pos21
3. A stone (stone1) initially at position pos22
4. The goal is pos34
5. We need to move the stone to the goal location (pos34)

The grid seems to be structured as follows:
pos11 pos12 pos13 pos14 pos15
pos21 pos22 pos23 pos24 pos25
pos31 pos32 pos33 pos34 pos35
pos41 pos42 pos43 pos44 pos45
pos51 pos52 pos53 pos54 pos55

The player starts at pos21, and the stone is at pos22:
```
.....
P*...
.....
.....
.....
```
Where P is the player, * is the stone, and G is the goal at pos34.

Wait, there's an issue in the problem statement: It says both "Location pos21 is clear" and "player1 is at location pos21". Similarly, it says both "Location pos22 is clear" and "stone1 is at location pos22". These statements contradict each other. Given the nature of the actions and the rest of the problem, I'll assume that the player is at pos21 and the stone is at pos22, meaning those locations are NOT clear.

Our goal is to move the stone to pos34, which is at the 3rd row, 4th column:
```
.....
P*...
...G.
.....
.....
```

To push the stone, we need to be on the opposite side of where we want it to go. We can push in four directions: up, down, left, and right.

Let's plan a path to get the stone to the goal:
1. We need to move the stone from pos22 to pos34 (down and right).
2. To push the stone down, we need to be above it (at pos12).
3. To push the stone right, we need to be to its left.

Here's a possible plan:

1. First, we need to move above the stone, to pos12:
   - Move player1 from pos21 to pos11 following direction dirleft
   - Move player1 from pos11 to pos12 following direction dirdown

2. Now, we can push the stone down to pos32:
   - pushtonon-goal player1 stone1 pos12 pos22 pos32 dirdown (We're at pos12, stone is at pos22, pushing it to pos32)

3. We need to get to the left of the stone to push it right:
   - Move player1 from pos22 to pos21 following direction dirup
   - Move player1 from pos21 to pos31 following direction dirright

4. Now, push the stone right to pos33:
   - pushtonon-goal player1 stone1 pos31 pos32 pos33 dirright (We're at pos31, stone is at pos32, pushing it to pos33)

5. Finally, push the stone down to the goal (pos34):
   - pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos33 pos34 dirdown (We're at pos32, stone is at pos33, pushing it to pos34)

That's our plan. Let me double-check it:

Initial state:
- Player at pos21
- Stone at pos22
- Goal at pos34

After step 1:
- Player at pos12
- Stone at pos22

After step 2:
- Player at pos22
- Stone at pos32

After step 3:
- Player at pos31
- Stone at pos32

After step 4:
- Player at pos32
- Stone at pos33

After step 5:
- Player at pos33
- Stone at pos34 (Goal)

This plan should work. But let me carefully check what the actions do to make sure I'm using them correctly. Specifically, I want to track the state of the world after each action.

Initial state:
- player1 is at location pos21
- stone1 is at location pos22
- Location pos12 is clear
- Location pos11 is clear
- Location pos31 is clear
- Location pos32 is clear
- Location pos33 is clear
- Location pos34 is clear (goal)

Step 1: Move player1 from pos21 to pos11 following dirleft
Effects:
- player1 is no longer at location pos21
- location pos11 is no longer clear
- player1 is at location pos11
- location pos21 is clear

State after Step 1:
- player1 is at location pos11
- stone1 is at location pos22
- Location pos12 is clear
- Location pos21 is clear
- Location pos31 is clear
- Location pos32 is clear
- Location pos33 is clear
- Location pos34 is clear (goal)

Step 2: Move player1 from pos11 to pos12 following dirdown
Effects:
- player1 is no longer at location pos11
- location pos12 is no longer clear
- player1 is at location pos12
- location pos11 is clear

State after Step 2:
- player1 is at location pos12
- stone1 is at location pos22
- Location pos11 is clear
- Location pos21 is clear
- Location pos31 is clear
- Location pos32 is clear
- Location pos33 is clear
- Location pos34 is clear (goal)

Step 3: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos12 pos22 pos32 dirdown
Effects:
- player1 is no longer at location pos12
- stone1 is no longer at location pos22
- location pos32 is no longer clear
- player1 is at location pos22
- stone1 is at location pos32
- location pos12 is clear
- stone1 is at a non-goal state

State after Step 3:
- player1 is at location pos22
- stone1 is at location pos32
- Location pos11 is clear
- Location pos12 is clear
- Location pos21 is clear
- Location pos31 is clear
- Location pos33 is clear
- Location pos34 is clear (goal)

Step 4: Move player1 from pos22 to pos21 following dirup
Effects:
- player1 is no longer at location pos22
- location pos21 is no longer clear
- player1 is at location pos21
- location pos22 is clear

State after Step 4:
- player1 is at location pos21
- stone1 is at location pos32
- Location pos11 is clear
- Location pos12 is clear
- Location pos22 is clear
- Location pos31 is clear
- Location pos33 is clear
- Location pos34 is clear (goal)

Step 5: Move player1 from pos21 to pos31 following dirright
Effects:
- player1 is no longer at location pos21
- location pos31 is no longer clear
- player1 is at location pos31
- location pos21 is clear

State after Step 5:
- player1 is at location pos31
- stone1 is at location pos32
- Location pos11 is clear
- Location pos12 is clear
- Location pos21 is clear
- Location pos22 is clear
- Location pos33 is clear
- Location pos34 is clear (goal)

Step 6: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos32 pos33 dirright
Effects:
- player1 is no longer at location pos31
- stone1 is no longer at location pos32
- location pos33 is no longer clear
- player1 is at location pos32
- stone1 is at location pos33
- location pos31 is clear
- stone1 is at a non-goal state

State after Step 6:
- player1 is at location pos32
- stone1 is at location pos33
- Location pos11 is clear
- Location pos12 is clear
- Location pos21 is clear
- Location pos22 is clear
- Location pos31 is clear
- Location pos34 is clear (goal)

Step 7: pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos33 pos34 dirdown
Effects:
- player1 is no longer at location pos32
- stone1 is no longer at location pos33
- location pos34 is no longer clear
- player1 is at location pos33
- stone1 is at location pos34
- location pos32 is clear
- stone1 is at a goal state

State after Step 7:
- player1 is at location pos33
- stone1 is at location pos34 (goal)
- Location pos11 is clear
- Location pos12 is clear
- Location pos21 is clear
- Location pos22 is clear
- Location pos31 is clear
- Location pos32 is clear

The final state achieves our goal: stone1 is at a goal location (pos34).

Let me write the action sequence formally:

1. move player1 pos21 pos11 dirleft
2. move player1 pos11 pos12 dirdown
3. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos12 pos22 pos32 dirdown
4. move player1 pos22 pos21 dirup
5. move player1 pos21 pos31 dirright
6. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos32 pos33 dirright
7. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos33 pos34 dirdown

This is a valid plan to get the stone to the goal location.

Wait, I realized there's something odd in the problem statement. It says:
```
"Location pos21 is clear"
"Location pos22 is clear"
```
But it also says:
```
"player1 is at location pos21"
"stone1 is at location pos22"
```

This is contradictory. A location can't be both clear and have an object on it. Upon re-reading, I think the "clear" claims at the bottom are errors in the problem statement, given the earlier claims about the player and stone positions and the nature of the actions. So I'll stick with my understanding that:
- player1 is at location pos21
- stone1 is at location pos22
- And other locations mentioned as clear are indeed clear.

Actually, I think the issue is that the "Location pos21 is clear" and "Location pos22 is clear" statements were listed in the "needed situation", not in the initial state. So those are part of the goal state, which means the agent and stone shouldn't be at those locations in the final state. But our goal is simply "stone1 is at a goal location", so those additional conditions might be extraneous.

Actually, those statements are at the very end of the initial state section. Let me reread the problem statement to make sure I'm understanding it correctly.

On second thought, I think the problem statement might have a mistake. It first lists the agent as being at pos21 and the stone at pos22, then later says those locations are clear. Given the nature of the actions and constraints, it's more logical to assume the first statements are correct: the agent is at pos21 and the stone is at pos22, and those locations are not clear.

So, I'll stick with my planned actions:

1. move player1 pos21 pos11 dirleft
2. move player1 pos11 pos12 dirdown
3. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos12 pos22 pos32 dirdown
4. move player1 pos22 pos21 dirup
5. move player1 pos21 pos31 dirright
6. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos32 pos33 dirright
7. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos33 pos34 dirdown

Actually, I realized I misunderstood the problem format. The problem description seems to list both the initial state and all the specifications of the world in a single list (e.g., where the agent and stone are, which locations are clear, and which locations are connected). So, it seems that the specification of the world says both "player1 is at location pos21" (the initial position of the player) and "Location pos21 is clear" (a specification of the world for the action preconditions and effects). This doesn't make sense to me, but let's try to reason through it.

If the player and stone are at their respective locations, then those locations cannot also be clear. The action preconditions rely on knowing which locations are clear. For example, the "move" action requires the destination to be clear.

Given this inconsistency, I think the most reasonable interpretation is that the initial state is:
- player1 is at location pos21
- stone1 is at location pos22
- All other locations are clear.

And the final statements about pos21 and pos22 being clear are likely errors. Let's proceed with our plan.

Actually, upon revisiting the problem statement, I noticed that the contradictory statements come right after "The task is to bring about the following situation:". Then, in addition to "stone1 is at a goal location", it says "Location pos21 is clear" and "Location pos22 is clear". This makes more sense: the goal is not only to have the stone at a goal location but also to ensure that positions pos21 and pos22 are clear.

My plan still achieves this goal, as in the final state:
- stone1 is at location pos34 (a goal location)
- player1 is at location pos33
- both pos21 and pos22 are clear

But wait, after taking another look, the lines "Location pos21 is clear" and "Location pos22 is clear" are still part of the initial state (they come before "The task is to bring about the following situation:").

Let me go through the problem statement step by step to make sure I understand it correctly:

1. The problem describes the world, objects, actions, and preconditions.
2. It says that player1 is at pos21 and stone1 is at pos22, which are part of the initial state.
3. It also says all other locations are clear in the initial state.
4. Then it contradicts itself by saying "Location pos21 is clear" and "Location pos22 is clear" in the initial state.
5. The goal is simply "stone1 is at a goal location".

Given the inconsistency, I think the most reasonable interpretation is that the player and stone are at their specified positions, and those locations are not clear. The statements at the end might be a mistake.

Let's proceed with our plan and see if it's valid.

Actually, let's look at the problem statement line by line to make sure I understand it correctly.

The world has a 5x5 grid, an agent, a stone, and several possible actions.

The actions are move, pushtogoal, and pushtonongoal. Their preconditions and effects are as described.

The original state of the world is then listed, which includes the following statements:
```
"player1 is at location pos21"
"stone1 is at location pos22"
"Location pos11 is clear"
"Location pos12 is clear"
...
```

After listing many such statements, including which locations are connected and which are goal locations, it says:
```
"Location pos21 is clear"
"Location pos22 is clear"
```

This is followed by:
```
The task is to bring about the following situation:
    "stone1 is at a goal location"
```

The inconsistency is in the original state, where it first says the player and stone are at certain locations, but then later says those same locations are clear.

I think there might be a mistake in the problem statement, or there's a misunderstanding on my part.

However, the plan I've outlined should achieve the goal of moving the stone to a goal location (pos34), and it's a valid plan based on the actions and their preconditions/effects, assuming the player and stone are at their specified positions and those locations are not clear.

Let me try one more time to understand the problem:

I think the issue is with how the problem is formalized. In the original state, the statements "player1 is at location pos21" and "stone1 is at location pos22" describe the initial positions of the player and stone. The later statements "Location pos21 is clear" and "Location pos22 is clear" are likely not meant to be part of the initial state, but rather templates for the effect of the actions, which will be used to update the world state as actions are taken. The "clear" predicate is used in the action preconditions and effects, so these statements are necessary for the world state to be updated correctly, but they don't necessarily describe the initial state.

For example, if the player moves from pos21 to pos11, then the "Location pos21 is clear" statement would be updated to true, and the "Location pos11 is clear" statement would be updated to false.

Given this understanding, the initial state is:
- player1 is at location pos21
- stone1 is at location pos22
- All other locations are clear.

The goal is to move the stone to a goal location (pos34). The plan to achieve this has been outlined, and it does work:

1. move player1 pos21 pos11 dirleft
2. move player1 pos11 pos12 dirdown
3. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos12 pos22 pos32 dirdown
4. move player1 pos22 pos21 dirup
5. move player1 pos21 pos31 dirright
6. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos32 pos33 dirright
7. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos33 pos34 dirdown

I believe this is a valid, optimal plan to get the stone to the goal location.

Actually, I think there's a simpler interpretation: there might just be a mistake in the problem statement at the end of the initial state, and the statements about pos21 and pos22 being clear are errors.

Let's go with that understanding and the plan outlined above.

I'm thinking now, actually, this might be an error in how the problem is represented. Looking back at the problem statement, the very last part of the initial state says:

```
"Location pos21 is clear"
"Location pos22 is clear"
```

This may indicate that there's a mistake in the earlier part where it says "player1 is at location pos21" and "stone1 is at location pos22". It's hard to tell for sure, but the actions and their preconditions/effects do rely on knowing which locations are clear.

But this whole discrepancy might also mean that there's a cleaner plan I'm not seeing, where the player and stone start in different locations.

Let me think about it from scratch: If the player and stone are not at pos21 and pos22, but instead those locations are clear, then where are the player and stone initially?

Actually, the problem also states that the goal is to bring about the situation: "stone1 is at a goal location", and the only goal location is pos34. So regardless of the initial state, the stone needs to end up at pos34.

Let's re-interpret the initial state as: the player and stone are not at any of the positions mentioned, and all the locations listed as clear are indeed clear. This seems very unlikely since it would mean there's no player or stone on the grid.

On the other hand, if the player and stone are at positions pos21 and pos22 respectively, then the statements about those locations being clear are mistakes.

I'm going to go with the latter interpretation, as it makes more sense in the context of a Sokoban-like puzzle. The plan I've outlined will achieve the goal of moving the stone to a goal location (pos34), and it's valid based on the actions and their preconditions/effects, assuming the player and stone are at their specified positions.

So, my plan remains:

1. move player1 pos21 pos11 dirleft
2. move player1 pos11 pos12 dirdown
3. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos12 pos22 pos32 dirdown
4. move player1 pos22 pos21 dirup
5. move player1 pos21 pos31 dirright
6. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos32 pos33 dirright
7. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos33 pos34 dirdown

I think this is a valid, optimal plan to get the stone to the goal location.

Actually, here's one more perspective: the earlier stuff in the problem statement seems consistent with the player being at pos21 and the stone being at pos22. If the statements at the end of the initial state are an error, it's likely because they were intended to be statements about the goal situation, not the initial state. In which case, the plan I've outlined is correct.

Let me double-check the plan again to make sure it's valid.

Initial state:
- player1 is at location pos21
- stone1 is at location pos22
- All other locations are clear.

Step 1: move player1 pos21 pos11 dirleft
Results: player1 at pos11, stone1 at pos22, pos21 is clear

Step 2: move player1 pos11 pos12 dirdown
Results: player1 at pos12, stone1 at pos22, pos11 is clear

Step 3: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos12 pos22 pos32 dirdown
Results: player1 at pos22, stone1 at pos32, pos12 is clear

Step 4: move player1 pos22 pos21 dirup
Results: player1 at pos21, stone1 at pos32, pos22 is clear

Step 5: move player1 pos21 pos31 dirright
Results: player1 at pos31, stone1 at pos32, pos21 is clear

Step 6: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos32 pos33 dirright
Results: player1 at pos32, stone1 at pos33, pos31 is clear

Step 7: pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos33 pos34 dirdown
Results: player1 at pos33, stone1 at pos34 (goal location), pos32 is clear

Final state:
- player1 is at location pos33
- stone1 is at location pos34 (a goal location)
- All other locations, including pos21 and pos22, are clear.

This plan achieves the goal and is valid based on the actions and their preconditions/effects.

After careful consideration, I believe the plan I've outlined is correct and achieves the goal of moving the stone to a goal location (pos34). The inconsistency in the problem statement appears to be an error, but the plan is valid and achieves the goal regardless.

Let me check if this is also an optimal plan (i.e., the shortest plan that achieves the goal).

Can we do it in fewer than 7 steps? Let's think...

Step 1-2: We need to get the player above the stone.
Step 3: Push the stone down.
Step 4-5: Get to the left of the stone.
Step 6: Push the stone right.
Step 7: Push the stone to the goal.

Each of these steps seems necessary, and I can't see a way to combine or eliminate any of them. Therefore, I believe this is an optimal plan with 7 steps.

Finally, let me answer with the valid, optimal plan:

1. move player1 pos21 pos11 dirleft
2. move player1 pos11 pos12 dirdown
3. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos12 pos22 pos32 dirdown
4. move player1 pos22 pos21 dirup
5. move player1 pos21 pos31 dirright
6. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos32 pos33 dirright
7. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos33 pos34 dirdown
