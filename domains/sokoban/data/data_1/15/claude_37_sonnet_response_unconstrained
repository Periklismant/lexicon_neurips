Let's first understand the planning problem. We are navigating on a 5x5 grid, where the positions are labeled as pos11 (top-left) to pos55 (bottom-right). The player (player1) starts at pos14 and the stone (stone1) is at pos33. The goal is to move the stone to a goal location. The only goal location is pos55 (bottom-right).

We need to plan a sequence of moves to reach stone1 and then push it to pos55. 

Let's analyze the grid:
- player1 is at pos14
- stone1 is at pos33
- The goal location is pos55

Let's set up the grid for better visualization (player as P, stone as S, goal as G). The coordinates are in the format posXY where X is the row (1-5) and Y is the column (1-5):

```
11 12 13 P  15
21 22 23 24 25
31 32 S  34 35
41 42 43 44 45
51 52 53 54 G
```

To push the stone to pos55, we need to get to a position adjacent to the stone and push it in the direction of pos55. 

Starting from pos14, let's first move the player to a position where they can push the stone. The stone is at pos33, so we need to be at one of the adjacent positions: pos23, pos32, pos43, or pos34.

Let's say we want to push the stone downward and then to the right until we reach pos55. So, we want to get to pos23 to push the stone down.

Here's a plan to get to pos23:
1. Move from pos14 to pos13 (direction: dirup)
2. Move from pos13 to pos23 (direction: dirright)

Now, we're at pos23 and the stone is at pos33. We want to push the stone down to pos43. Since pos43 is not a goal, we'll use pushtonongoal:
3. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos33 pos43 dirdown

Now the player is at pos33 and the stone is at pos43. We want to push the stone to the right towards the goal. Let's get the player to pos33 and push the stone right to pos53:
4. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos43 pos53 dirright

Now the player is at pos43 and the stone is at pos53. We want to push the stone down to pos54:
5. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos53 pos54 dirdown

Finally, we can push the stone to the goal at pos55:
6. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos53 pos54 pos55 dirdown

Wait, let me double-check these actions. After step 3, I said the player is at pos33 and the stone is at pos43. Now, to push the stone right to pos53 from pos43, the player needs to be at pos33 (which they are), and the destination pos53 needs to be clear (which it is). 

However, there's one more detail: after the pushtonongoal action, the player's position updates to the stone's previous position. So after pushing the stone from pos33 to pos43, the player should be at pos33, not pos23 as I had initially thought.

Let's restate the plan:

1. Move from pos14 to pos13 (direction: dirup)
2. Move from pos13 to pos23 (direction: dirright)
3. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos33 pos43 dirdown

After step 3, the player is at pos33 and the stone is at pos43.

4. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos43 pos53 dirright

After step 4, the player is at pos43 and the stone is at pos53.

5. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos53 pos54 dirdown

After step 5, the player is at pos53 and the stone is at pos54.

6. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos53 pos54 pos55 dirdown

After step 6, the player is at pos54 and the stone is at pos55, which is a goal location.

But let me reconsider the grid structure. Let's check if the directions in the problem statement match what we'd expect:

In the grid I described, dirdown, would mean moving to a position with a larger first coordinate (e.g., from pos11 to pos21) and dirup would mean moving to a position with a smaller first coordinate (e.g., from pos21 to pos11). However, it seems from the problem statement that dirdown means moving from a position with a smaller second coordinate to a larger one (e.g., from pos11 to pos12), and dirup means the opposite.

I think I've been confused about the orientation of the grid. Let's double-check from the given information.

"You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright" - This suggests that dirright means moving from (x,y) to (x+1,y).
"You may move from location pos11 to location pos12 following direction dirdown" - This suggests that dirdown means moving from (x,y) to (x,y+1).

Based on this information, the correct grid orientation is:

```
11 12 13 14 15
21 22 23 24 25
31 32 33 34 35
41 42 43 44 45
51 52 53 54 55
```

In this grid, the player starts at pos14, and the stone is at pos33. The goal is at pos55.

Given this new understanding, let me reconstruct the plan:

First, I need to get the player adjacent to the stone to push it. The stone is at pos33, so I can approach it from pos32, pos23, pos34, or pos43. I'll aim to push the stone towards pos55, so getting to pos32 seems like a good strategy to first push the stone to the right and then down.

1. Move from pos14 to pos24 (direction: dirright)
2. Move from pos24 to pos23 (direction: dirup)
3. Move from pos23 to pos33 (direction: dirright)

But that doesn't work because the stone is already at pos33.

Let me think again. From pos14, I can go to pos24 and then pos34, which puts me to the right of the stone. Then I can push the stone to the left. But that's not really helping us get to pos55.

Let's instead try to get to pos32 to push the stone to the right:

1. Move from pos14 to pos13 (direction: dirup)
2. Move from pos13 to pos23 (direction: dirright)
3. Move from pos23 to pos22 (direction: dirup)
4. Move from pos22 to pos32 (direction: dirright)

Now I can push the stone to the right:

5. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos33 pos34 dirright

Now the player is at pos33 and the stone is at pos34. Let's push it again to the right:

6. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos34 pos35 dirright

Now the player is at pos34 and the stone is at pos35. Let's push it down:

7. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos35 pos45 dirdown

Now the player is at pos35 and the stone is at pos45. Let's push it to the right:

8. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos35 pos45 pos55 dirright

But wait, pos55 is a goal location, so we should use pushtogoal instead:

8. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos35 pos45 pos55 dirright

But there's a problem here. The action "pushtogoal" requires the destination to be a goal location, which pos55 is. But it also requires that we can move from pos45 to pos55 following the direction dirright. I need to double-check if this movement is valid.

"You may move from location pos45 to location pos55 following direction dirright" - This is stated in the problem, so the movement is valid.

So the final step is:

8. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos35 pos45 pos55 dirright

Actually, let me crosscheck the entire solution. It's important to ensure that the player can push the stone as planned. Let's recheck each step:

1. Move from pos14 to pos13 (direction: dirup) - Player can move up from pos14 to pos13.
2. Move from pos13 to pos23 (direction: dirright) - Player can move right from pos13 to pos23.
3. Move from pos23 to pos22 (direction: dirup) - Player can move up from pos23 to pos22.
4. Move from pos22 to pos32 (direction: dirright) - Player can move right from pos22 to pos32.
5. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos33 pos34 dirright - Stone is at pos33, and we can push it to pos34.
6. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos34 pos35 dirright - Stone is now at pos34, and we push it to pos35.
7. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos35 pos45 dirdown - Stone is at pos35, and we push it to pos45.
8. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos35 pos45 pos55 dirright - Stone is at pos45, and we push it to pos55, which is a goal.

Actually, I think I'm still misunderstanding the coordinate system. Let's re-evaluate the precondition to the first "move" action: "move p l_from l_to d": You may only perform this action if (i) agent p is at location l_from, (ii) location l_to is clear, and (iii) you can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d.

Let me double-check from the movement rules given in the problem. The stone is at pos33 and the player is at pos14. There are rules like "You may move from location pos14 to location pos24 following direction dirright" and "You may move from location pos14 to location pos13 following direction dirup". I think, then, that:

dirright means from posXY to pos(X+1)Y
dirup means from posXY to posX(Y-1)
dirdown means from posXY to posX(Y+1)
dirleft means from posXY to pos(X-1)Y

Actually, I realized that I completely confused myself. Let me first understand the coordinate system clearly. Given the positions and movements, here's how I interpret the positions:

```
11 21 31 41 51
12 22 32 42 52
13 23 33 43 53
14 24 34 44 54
15 25 35 45 55
```

Where:
dirright means moving from posXY to pos(X+1)Y
dirleft means moving from posXY to pos(X-1)Y
dirdown means moving from posXY to posX(Y+1)
dirup means moving from posXY to posX(Y-1)

Actually, this means that that row number is the position's first digit and column number is the position's second digit. So pos11 is indeed the top-left position of the grid, and pos55 is the bottom-right.

Let me redraw the grid with the player (P), stone (S), and goal (G):

```
11 21 31 41 51
12 22 32 42 52
13 23 33 43 53
P  24 34 44 54
15 25 35 45 G
```

Now, the player is at pos14, and the stone is at pos33. Our goal is to push the stone to pos55. Given this, let's plan again:

Let's approach the stone from the left, push it to the right, and then push it down to the goal.

1. Move from pos14 to pos24 (direction: dirright) - Player moves from pos14 to pos24.
2. Move from pos24 to pos23 (direction: dirup) - Player moves up from pos24 to pos23.
3. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos33 pos43 dirright - Player pushes the stone from pos33 to pos43.

After this, the player is at pos33 and the stone is at pos43.

4. Move from pos33 to pos34 (direction: dirdown) - Player moves down from pos33 to pos34.
5. Move from pos34 to pos44 (direction: dirright) - Player moves right from pos34 to pos44.
6. Move from pos44 to pos43 (direction: dirup) - Player moves up from pos44 to pos43.

Actually, I realize this won't work because pushing the stone to pos43 makes the stone occupy that position, so the player can't go to pos43 afterwards.

Let's change the approach. Let's plan to push the stone down to position pos34, then push it right to position pos54, and finally push it down to the goal at pos55.

1. Move from pos14 to pos24 (direction: dirright) - Player moves from pos14 to pos24.
2. Move from pos24 to pos23 (direction: dirup) - Player moves up from pos24 to pos23.
3. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos33 pos34 dirdown - Player pushes the stone from pos33 to pos34.

After this, the player is at pos33 and the stone is at pos34.

4. Move from pos33 to pos43 (direction: dirright) - Player moves right from pos33 to pos43.
5. Move from pos43 to pos44 (direction: dirdown) - Player moves down from pos43 to pos44.
6. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos34 pos54 dirright - Player pushes the stone from pos34 to pos54.

Actually, I made a conceptual error. After pushing the stone from pos33 to pos34, the player's new position is pos33. But for the pushtonongoal action in step 6, the player needs to be at pos44 and the stone at pos34. How does the player get to pos44?

I think I'm confusing myself with the movement. Let's clarify the interpretation of the actions, especially the push actions:

"pushtonongoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": Make agent p, situated at location l_p, push stone s from location l_from to non-goal location l_to, following direction d.

For this action, the agent is at l_p, the stone is at l_from, and we push the stone to l_to. After the action, the agent is at l_from (where the stone was) and the stone is at l_to.

With this understanding, let's reapproach:

1. We want to get the player to a position adjacent to the stone, which is at pos33.

2. Player currently at pos14. Let's go through pos24, pos23, and then to pos32 (left of the stone):
   - Move from pos14 to pos24 (direction: dirright)
   - Move from pos24 to pos23 (direction: dirup)
   - Move from pos23 to pos32 (direction: dirleft)

3. Now the player is at pos32 and the stone is at pos33. Let's push the stone to the right:
   - pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos33 pos43 dirright

4. After this, the player is at pos33 and the stone is at pos43. Now, let's move the player to push the stone down towards the goal:
   - Move from pos33 to pos43 (direction: dirright)
   - Move from pos43 to pos44 (direction: dirdown)
   - Move from pos44 to pos54 (direction: dirright)
   - Move from pos54 to pos53 (direction: dirup)

5. Now the player is at pos53, adjacent to the stone at pos43. Let's push the stone down:
   - pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos53 pos43 pos44 dirdown

Wait, I think I've confused myself again. After step 3, the player is at pos33 and the stone is at pos43. I want to push the stone from pos43 to pos53 (to the right), so I need to get the player to pos33 (which they already are). Let me validate the player can push in that manner, right from pos33 to push the stone from pos43 to pos53:

"You may move from location pos33 to location pos43 following direction dirright"
"You may move from location pos43 to location pos53 following direction dirright"

So we can do:

4. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos43 pos53 dirright

After this, the player is at pos43 and the stone is at pos53.

5. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos53 pos54 dirdown

Now the player is at pos53 and the stone is at pos54.

6. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos53 pos54 pos55 dirdown

Now the player is at pos54 and the stone is at pos55, which is the goal.

Let's see if this plan is viable by checking all preconditions:

1. Move from pos14 to pos24 (direction: dirright)
   - Player is at pos14 (✓)
   - pos24 is clear (✓)
   - Can move from pos14 to pos24 following direction dirright (✓)

2. Move from pos24 to pos23 (direction: dirup)
   - Player is at pos24 (✓)
   - pos23 is clear (✓)
   - Can move from pos24 to pos23 following direction dirup (✓)

3. Move from pos23 to pos32 (direction: dirleft)
   - Player is at pos23 (✓)
   - pos32 is clear (✓)
   - Can move from pos23 to pos32 following direction dirleft (✓)

   Actually, I just realized this doesn't seem right. "dirleft" should be moving from some posXY to pos(X-1)Y, so we should be moving from pos23 to pos13, not to pos32. Let's review the grid and directions again.

dirright means moving from posXY to pos(X+1)Y (moving right on the grid)
dirleft means moving from posXY to pos(X-1)Y (moving left on the grid)
dirdown means moving from posXY to posX(Y+1) (moving down on the grid)
dirup means moving from posXY to posX(Y-1) (moving up on the grid)

But is this correct in terms of the grid we're visualizing? Let's verify from the problem statement:

"You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright" - This corresponds to moving from the top-left to the right.
"You may move from location pos11 to location pos12 following direction dirdown" - This corresponds to moving from the top-left down.

So the correct grid is:

```
11 21 31 41 51
12 22 32 42 52
13 23 33 43 53
14 24 34 44 54
15 25 35 45 55
```

Where the top row is row 1 and the leftmost column is column 1. Player is at pos14, stone is at pos33, and the goal is at pos55.

Let's now replan:

1. I'll approach the stone from the left:
   - Move from pos14 to pos13 (direction: dirup)
   - Move from pos13 to pos23 (direction: dirright)
   - Move from pos23 to pos32 (direction: dirup)

2. Now the player is at pos32 and the stone is at pos33. Let's push the stone to the right:
   - pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos33 pos43 dirright

3. After this, the player is at pos33 and the stone is at pos43. Let's push the stone further right:
   - pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos43 pos53 dirright

4. Now the player is at pos43 and the stone is at pos53. Let's push the stone down:
   - pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos53 pos54 dirdown

5. Now the player is at pos53 and the stone is at pos54. Let's push the stone to the goal:
   - pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos53 pos54 pos55 dirdown

Actually, let me double check the direction from pos23 to pos32. We go from posXY to posX'Y'. Here, X=2, Y=3, X'=3, Y'=2. Going by our understanding, dirright means X'=X+1, Y'=Y (which would be pos33 from pos23, not pos32), and dirup means X'=X, Y'=Y-1 (which would be pos22 from pos23, not pos32).

I don't think pos23 directly connects to pos32 in a single move. Let's revise our plan:

1. From pos14, I'll move up first, then right, then up, then right:
   - Move from pos14 to pos13 (direction: dirup)
   - Move from pos13 to pos23 (direction: dirright)
   - Move from pos23 to pos22 (direction: dirup)
   - Move from pos22 to pos32 (direction: dirright)

2. Now the player is at pos32 and the stone is at pos33. Let's push the stone to the right:
   - pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos33 pos43 dirright

Wait, let me actually check the validity of these intended moves.  Now I'd better trace in detail. Looking at the problem spec again:

"You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright"
"You may move from location pos11 to location pos12 following direction dirdown"

So moving from position pos11 to pos21 is dirright (right) and moving from position pos11 to pos12 is dirdown (down). That means we have

pos11 pos21 pos31 pos41 pos51
pos12 pos22 pos32 pos42 pos52
pos13 pos23 pos33 pos43 pos53
pos14 pos24 pos34 pos44 pos54
pos15 pos25 pos35 pos45 pos55

where the first position digit is column, and the second is row. So the player is at column 1, row 4 (pos14), and the stone is at column 3, row 3 (pos33). The goal is at column 5, row 5 (pos55).

So from pos14 to pos24 is a right move (dirright) and from pos14 to pos13 is an up move (dirup). I think I had this right originally, I just got confused.

Let's now trace the whole movement:

1. Move from pos14 to pos24 (direction: dirright) - Player moves right from the first column to the second.
2. Move from pos24 to pos34 (direction: dirright) - Player moves further right to the third column.
3. Move from pos34 to pos33 (direction: dirup) - Player moves up to be below the stone.

4. Now the player is at pos33 and the stone is at pos33. But wait that's not right! The player and the stone can't be in the same place! Let me review the problem.

Let me re-trace the current state:
Player is at pos14 (column 1, row 4).
Stone is at pos33 (column 3, row 3).

1. Move from pos14 to pos24 (direction: dirright) - Player moves from column 1 to column 2.
2. Move from pos24 to pos23 (direction: dirup) - Player moves up from row 4 to row 3.
3. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos33 pos43 dirright - Player pushes the stone right from column 3 to column 4.

4. Now the player is at pos33 and the stone is at pos43. Let's push the stone further right:
   - pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos43 pos53 dirright

5. Now the player is at pos43 and the stone is at pos53. Let's push the stone down:
   - pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos53 pos54 dirdown

6. Now the player is at pos53 and the stone is at pos54. Let's push the stone to the goal:
   - pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos53 pos54 pos55 dirdown

Let's once more verify the validity of our actions.

"You may move from location pos14 to location pos24 following direction dirright"
"You may move from location pos24 to location pos23 following direction dirup"
"You may move from location pos23 to location pos33 following direction dirright"

But this third one doesn't match our step 3. Instead, we're trying to use pushtonongoal from pos23 to push the stone at pos33 to pos43.

Let's double-check the preconditions for the pushtonongoal action:

"pushtonongoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": You may only perform this action if (i) agent p is at location l_p, (ii) stone s is at location l_from, (iii) location l_to is clear, (iv) you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d, (v) you can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d, and (vi) location l_to is not a goal location.

For our step 3, agent p (player1) is at location l_p (pos23), stone s (stone1) is at location l_from (pos33), location l_to (pos43) is clear (✓), and location l_to (pos43) is not a goal location (✓). But we need to check if (iv) we can get from location pos23 to location pos33 following direction dirright, and (v) we can get from location pos33 to location pos43 following direction dirright.

"You may move from location pos23 to location pos33 following direction dirright" (✓)
"You may move from location pos33 to location pos43 following direction dirright" (✓)

So that's available per the problem spec.

Let's check the rest of our planned actions:

For step 4:
Agent p (player1) is at location l_p (pos33), stone s (stone1) is at location l_from (pos43), location l_to (pos53) is clear (✓), and location l_to (pos53) is not a goal location (✓). We need to check if we can get from location pos33 to location pos43 following direction dirright, and we can get from location pos43 to location pos53 following direction dirright.

"You may move from location pos33 to location pos43 following direction dirright" (✓)
"You may move from location pos43 to location pos53 following direction dirright" (✓)

For step 5:
Agent p (player1) is at location l_p (pos43), stone s (stone1) is at location l_from (pos53), location l_to (pos54) is clear (✓), and location l_to (pos54) is not a goal location (✓). We need to check if we can get from location pos43 to location pos53 following direction dirright, and we can get from location pos53 to location pos54 following direction dirdown.

"You may move from location pos43 to location pos53 following direction dirright" (✓)
"You may move from location pos53 to location pos54 following direction dirdown" (✓)

For step 6:
Agent p (player1) is at location l_p (pos53), stone s (stone1) is at location l_from (pos54), location l_to (pos55) is clear (✓), and location l_to (pos55) is a goal location (✓). We need to check if we can get from location pos53 to location pos54 following direction dirdown, and we can get from location pos54 to location pos55 following direction dirdown.

"You may move from location pos53 to location pos54 following direction dirdown" (✓)
"You may move from location pos54 to location pos55 following direction dirdown" (✓)

Ok, our plan seems to be valid. But wait, I need to again verify that my grid understanding is correct. Let me check from the problem statement:

"You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright"
"You may move from location pos11 to location pos12 following direction dirdown"

If I intrepet this correctly, I'm defining the grid as:

```
11 21 31 41 51
12 22 32 42 52
13 23 33 43 53
14 24 34 44 54
15 25 35 45 55
```

where each posXY corresponds to column X, row Y. With that, moving dirright from pos11 gets us to pos21, and moving dirdown from pos11 gets us to pos12. This grid interpretation seems correct, so I believe my reasoning above is also correct.

To double check, let me work out where the player and stone start out:

"player1 is at location pos14" - Player is at column 1, row 4
"stone1 is at location pos33" - Stone is at column 3, row 3

That seems like our grid understanding  of the problem.

One last time just to ensure I have it:
pos14 = column 1, row 4
pos33 = column 3, row 3
dirright = move to next column
dirleft = move to previous column
dirdown = move to next row
dirup = move to previous row

With that, our plans should be correct as described above. I'll rewrite the full solution:

1. Move from pos14 to pos24 (direction: dirright)
2. Move from pos24 to pos23 (direction: dirup)
3. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos33 pos43 dirright
4. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos43 pos53 dirright
5. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos53 pos54 dirdown
6. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos53 pos54 pos55 dirdown
