Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. So the goal is to get stone1 to a goal location. From the initial state, stone1 is at pos33, and the only goal location mentioned is pos23. The agent starts at pos53. 

First, I need to figure out how to move the agent from pos53 to pos33 to push the stone. Looking at the movement possibilities, pos53 can move to pos43 (dirleft) or pos54 (dirdown), but since the stone is at pos33, I need to reach there. Let's see the path.

From pos53, the agent can move dirleft to pos43. Then from pos43, moving dirleft would take them to pos33? Wait, checking the allowed moves: pos43 can go to pos33 via dirleft? Let me check the "You may move from" statements. Yes, "You may move from location pos43 to location pos33 following direction dirleft". So from pos43 to pos33 is possible with dirleft.

So the plan would be: move player1 from pos53 to pos43 via dirleft. Then move from pos43 to pos33 via dirleft. Wait, but when the agent is at pos43, moving dirleft would go to pos33. But pos33 currently has stone1. So the agent can't move directly into pos33 because it's not clear. Oh right! The initial state says "Location pos33 is clear" but stone1 is at pos33. Wait, that's conflicting. Wait, the initial state lists "stone1 is at location pos33" and "Location pos33 is clear". That can't be. Wait, maybe there's a mistake here. Let me check again.

Looking at the original state: "stone1 is at location pos33" and "Location pos33 is clear". That's a contradiction unless "clear" means something else. Wait, maybe "clear" means there's no agent or stone there. But if the stone is at pos33, then pos33 shouldn't be clear. So perhaps there's an error in the problem setup. Hmm. But according to the given data, stone1 is at pos33 and pos33 is clear. That's impossible. Maybe it's a typo. Wait, looking at the original state statements:

The original state includes:
- "stone1 is at location pos33"
- "Location pos33 is clear"

That's conflicting. Unless "clear" refers to being accessible, but that doesn't make sense. Maybe it's a mistake. But the problem is given as such, so I have to work with that. So perhaps the stone is at pos33, but the location is considered clear? That's odd. But according to the problem's initial state, pos33 is clear despite having the stone. That must be a mistake, but I have to proceed as per the problem's description.

Wait, maybe "clear" in this context means that the agent is not there. Because the stones can be on a location, but the agent's presence affects the clearness. For example, the preconditions for move require that the destination is clear, meaning that there's no agent or stone there? Or maybe stones are allowed, but the agent can't be there. Hmm, the move action's preconditions say (ii) location l_to is clear. So if a stone is at l_to, then it's not clear. Therefore, the initial state must have pos33 not clear because stone1 is there. But according to the problem, "Location pos33 is clear". That's a problem. So perhaps there's an error in the problem statement. But since the user provided it, I have to proceed.

Alternatively, maybe "clear" refers only to the agent not being there. But that doesn't align with the action descriptions. For example, the move action requires that the destination is clear. If a stone is there, the move can't happen. So in the initial state, pos33 has a stone, so it's not clear, but the problem says "Location pos33 is clear". That's a contradiction. This is confusing.

Wait, maybe "clear" means that there's no agent present. So a location can have a stone but still be considered clear. Then, the agent can move into a location that has a stone? That doesn't make sense because moving into a stone's location would conflict. But according to the move action's preconditions, (ii) location l_to is clear. So if there's a stone at l_to, then the move can't happen. So in the initial state, pos33 is supposed to be clear (according to the problem), but the stone is there, making it not clear. Therefore, this is an error. But perhaps I should proceed under the assumption that the problem is correct as given. Maybe "clear" in the problem's context allows stones to be present? That doesn't make sense with the move action's preconditions. 

This is a problem. But since I have to work with the given information, let's proceed. The agent starts at pos53. The stone is at pos33, which is supposed to be clear. So perhaps the stone's presence doesn't affect the clearness. But that contradicts the preconditions for pushing actions, which require that the stone is at l_from. So maybe the clearness refers to the agent's presence. So a location is clear if the agent isn't there, regardless of stones. Then, the move action's precondition (ii) is that the agent is not at l_to. So in that case, the initial state has pos33 clear (no agent), even though the stone is there. Then the agent can move into pos33 if it's clear (no agent), but since the stone is there, perhaps the agent can't. Wait, but in that case, the stone's presence would block the agent. So the preconditions for move require that l_to is clear (agent not there), but stones can be there. But that's not possible because pushing actions are needed to move stones. 

This is really confusing. Maybe the problem has an error in stating that pos33 is clear while the stone is there. Let's assume that the initial state has stone1 at pos33 and pos33 is not clear. But the problem states "Location pos33 is clear". So perhaps there's a mistake, but I have to proceed. 

Alternatively, perhaps "clear" refers to the absence of both agent and stones. If that's the case, then the initial state is invalid. But given that the problem is presented as such, perhaps the user made a mistake, but the assistant must work with it. 

Assuming that the problem is correctly stated, even if there's a conflict, perhaps the stone is at pos33 but pos33 is considered clear. That would mean that the agent can move into pos33, which is where the stone is. But then the move action would allow the agent to move into a location with a stone, which isn't possible because pushing is needed. Therefore, the problem's initial state must have an error, but as a solver, I need to proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps the "Location pos33 is clear" is a typo and should be "Location pos33 is not clear". That would make sense. Let's proceed under that assumption. So stone1 is at pos33, making pos33 not clear. Then the initial state's statement "Location pos33 is clear" is incorrect, but maybe it's a typo. Alternatively, maybe the problem has other goal positions. Wait, the problem says the goal is "stone1 is at a goal location". The only goal location mentioned is pos23. So the plan is to move stone1 from pos33 to pos23.

So the agent needs to get to a position adjacent to pos33, then push the stone to pos23. Let's see the connections. pos33 can be moved to pos23 via dirleft (as per "You may move from location pos33 to location pos23 following direction dirleft"). So to push the stone from pos33 to pos23, the agent needs to be at pos33's direction towards pos23. Wait, the direction for pushing. The pushtogoal action requires that the agent is at l_p, which is adjacent to l_from (stone's current position) in the direction d. So for pushing from pos33 to pos23, the direction would be dirleft. The agent needs to be at pos43 (since from pos43 to pos33 is dirleft). Wait, no. Let's see: if the stone is at pos33 and the agent is at pos43, moving dirleft from pos43 would take the agent to pos33. But the stone is there. So perhaps the agent needs to be at pos32, which is north of pos33. Because pos33 can be reached from pos32 via dirdown. So the agent can be at pos32, then push the stone from pos33 to pos23, but how?

Wait, let's clarify the movement directions. The grid seems to be laid out with positions like pos11 (row 1, column 1), pos12 (row 1, column 2), up to pos55 (row5, column5). Directions: dirup, dirdown, dirleft, dirright. So for example, moving dirright from pos11 would go to pos12? Wait, no. Wait, the movement from pos11 is to pos21 following dirright. Wait, pos11 is row 1, column 1. So moving dirright from pos11 would increase the column, but in the given movement, pos11 can move to pos21 (row2, column1) via dirright. Wait, that's confusing. Maybe the directions are not standard. Let me check the movement statements again.

Looking at the movement statements:

"You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright"

So moving dirright from pos11 takes you to pos21, which is directly below. That suggests that dirright is down, which is unconventional. Similarly, "You may move from location pos11 to location pos12 following direction dirdown". So from pos11, dirdown takes you to pos12. That's even more confusing. Wait, this seems like the directions might be labeled differently. Maybe dirright corresponds to moving down a row, and dirdown corresponds to moving right a column. That would make pos11 (row1, column1) moving dirright to pos21 (row2, column1), and dirdown to pos12 (row1, column2). That's possible, but the direction names are counterintuitive. So dirright is moving down a row, dirdown is moving right a column, dirleft is moving up a row, and dirup is moving left a column. That's a possible grid layout. Alternatively, the grid is arranged such that directions are as per standard, but the movement is different. Regardless, the key is to follow the given movement possibilities.

So to get from pos53 (row5, column3) to pos33 (row3, column3), the agent needs to move up. Let's check the possible moves. From pos53, the allowed moves are:

- "You may move from location pos53 to location pos43 following direction dirleft"
- "You may move from location pos53 to location pos52 following direction dirup"
- "You may move from location pos53 to location pos54 following direction dirdown"

Wait, pos53 to pos43 via dirleft. So dirleft from pos53 leads to pos43. pos43 is row4, column3. Then from pos43, moving dirleft would take to pos33 (since "You may move from location pos43 to location pos33 following direction dirleft"). So dirleft from pos43 to pos33. But pos33 has the stone, so moving there would require that pos33 is clear. But according to the initial state, pos33 is clear (even though stone1 is there). If that's the case, then the agent can move into pos33. But that's conflicting because the stone is there. So perhaps the problem's initial state has an error. Alternatively, the agent can move into a location with a stone, but that would contradict the pushing actions' necessity. 

This is a critical point. If the agent can move into pos33, which has the stone, then the move action would be allowed, but that would mean the agent and stone are in the same location, which is impossible. Therefore, the initial state must have an error. But given that the problem states that pos33 is clear and stone1 is there, perhaps the correct approach is to ignore that and proceed under the assumption that pos33 is not clear (because of the stone) and the initial state's "clear" statement is incorrect. 

Assuming that pos33 is not clear (due to the stone), the agent needs to approach pos33 from an adjacent tile to push it. Let's see the surrounding positions. pos33 is connected to pos23 (dirleft), pos43 (dirright?), pos32 (dirup), pos34 (dirdown). Wait, based on the movement statements:

From pos33, you can move to pos23 (dirleft), pos43 (dirright), pos32 (dirup), pos34 (dirdown). So the agent can be in pos32, pos34, pos23, or pos43 to push the stone. 

But the agent starts at pos53. To get to pos43, the agent can move dirleft from pos53 to pos43. Then from pos43, dirleft to pos33 (but pos33 has the stone, so if pos33 is not clear, the agent can't move there. So the agent needs to push the stone from pos33 to pos23. To do that, the agent must be at pos43 (since pushing from pos33 to pos23 requires moving dirleft from pos33 to pos23. Wait, the direction for pushing is from the stone's current position to the target. So to push the stone from pos33 to pos23 (dirleft), the agent needs to be at pos33's dirright side (pos43), because the direction of pushing is dirleft. Because the agent has to be adjacent to the stone in the direction opposite to the push. For example, to push the stone left, the agent must be on the right side of the stone. So the agent is at pos43 (dirright of pos33), then pushes the stone dirleft to pos23. 

So the steps would be:

1. Move agent from pos53 to pos43 via dirleft.
2. From pos43, push the stone at pos33 to pos23 using pushtogoal (since pos23 is a goal location). 

Check the preconditions for the pushtogoal action:

- Agent is at l_p (pos43)
- Stone is at l_from (pos33)
- l_to (pos23) is clear
- Can move from pos43 to pos33 (dirleft) - check movement statements: "You may move from location pos43 to location pos33 following direction dirleft" → yes.
- Can move from pos33 to pos23 (dirleft) → "You may move from location pos33 to location pos23 following direction dirleft" → yes.
- l_to is a goal location (pos23 is a goal) → yes.

So after moving to pos43, the agent can perform pushtogoal. 

But wait, after moving to pos43, the agent is there. Then, the stone is at pos33. The location pos23 needs to be clear. According to the initial state, pos23 is clear (since "Location pos23 is clear" is not mentioned in the original state's clear list? Wait, looking back:

Original state lists clear locations, including pos23. The initial state says:

"Location pos23 is clear" → no. Wait, the original state lists:

"Location pos11 is clear"

... (many others)

"Location pos23 is clear" → Yes, in the original state, pos23 is clear. But pos23 is a goal location. Wait, the original state says:

"pos23 is a goal location"

But in the initial state's clear locations, pos23 is listed as clear. So initially, pos23 is clear. So pushing the stone there is allowed.

So the plan would be:

1. move player1 from pos53 to pos43 dirleft.

2. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos33 pos23 dirleft.

After this, stone1 is at pos23, which is a goal location. That achieves the goal.

But wait, after moving to pos43, the agent is at pos43. The pushtogoal action requires that the agent is at l_p (pos43), stone is at l_from (pos33), and the direction from l_p to l_from is dirleft (since pos43 to pos33 is dirleft). Then the direction from l_from to l_to is dirleft (pos33 to pos23). So the action would be "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos33 pos23 dirleft".

This seems valid. Let's check the effects:

After pushtogoal, the agent moves from pos43 to pos33, the stone moves to pos23. pos23 is now occupied by the stone, and the agent is at pos33. But since pos23 is a goal, the stone is now in a goal location. The problem's goal is satisfied.

So the plan has two actions. Is there a shorter plan? Let's see. The agent starts at pos53. To push the stone from pos33 to pos23, they need to be at pos43. The shortest path is moving dirleft from pos53 to pos43 (one move), then pushing (one action). Total of two actions. That's optimal.
