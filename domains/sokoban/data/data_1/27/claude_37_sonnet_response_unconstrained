Let me understand the problem:

We have a 2D grid where positions are denoted as `posXY` where X is the row and Y is the column.
There's an agent (`player1`) and a stone (`stone1`).
The goal is to move the stone to a goal location. The only goal location is `pos23`.
The current state is:
- `player1` is at `pos53`
- `stone1` is at `pos33`

We have three types of actions:
1. `move` to move the agent from one location to another.
2. `pushtogoal` to push a stone to a goal location.
3. `pushtonongoal` to push a stone to a non-goal location.

Let's visualize the grid:

```
11 12 13 14 15
21 22 23 24 25  (23 is a goal location)
31 32 33 34 35  (33 has stone1)
41 42 43 44 45
51 52 53 54 55  (53 has player1)
```

The task is to move `stone1` from `pos33` to `pos23` (the only goal location).

Here's my plan:

1. First, the player needs to get to the right position to push the stone. The player is at `pos53` and the stone is at `pos33`. To push the stone up, the player needs to be at `pos43`.

2. Once at `pos43`, the player can push the stone up from `pos33` to `pos23` using the `pushtogoal` action.

Let's implement this:

1. Move player from `pos53` to `pos43` using the `dirleft` direction.
2. Push the stone from `pos33` to `pos23` using the `dirdown` direction.

Wait, I need to double check the directions. Let's see what the movements mean based on the state descriptions:

- Moving from `pos11` to `pos21` follows `dirright`, so `dirright` means moving down a row.
- Moving from `pos11` to `pos12` follows `dirdown`, so `dirdown` means moving right a column.
- Moving from `pos12` to `pos11` follows `dirup`, so `dirup` means moving left a column.
- Moving from `pos21` to `pos11` follows `dirleft`, so `dirleft` means moving up a row.

So, to move from `pos53` to `pos43`, we should use `dirleft`. And to push the stone from `pos33` to `pos23`, we should use `dirleft` as well.

Now I'm confused about the directions. Let me analyze the preconditions and effects of the actions to better understand how they work:

For the `move` action, preconditions state that the agent should be at the source location, the destination should be clear, and you should be able to get from source to destination following a certain direction.

For the `pushtogoal` and `pushtonongoal` actions, the agent should be at a position, the stone should be at another position, and there's a direction such that by following it from the agent's position, you reach the stone, and by following the same direction from the stone, you reach the destination.

Let me correct my understanding of the directions based on the preconditions:

- If `player1` is at `pos43` and `stone1` is at `pos33`, then pushing `stone1` from `pos33` to `pos23` follows the `dirleft` direction.

Here's the corrected plan:

1. Move player from `pos53` to `pos43` using the `dirleft` direction.
2. Push the stone from `pos33` to `pos23` using the `dirleft` direction.

Let me check the format of the actions:

1. `move player1 pos53 pos43 dirleft`
2. `pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos33 pos23 dirleft`

Wait, I need to double check this. Let's carefully analyze the preconditions:

For `pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d`:
- Agent `p` is at location `l_p`.
- Stone `s` is at location `l_from`.
- Location `l_to` is clear.
- You can get from location `l_p` to location `l_from` following direction `d`.
- You can get from location `l_from` to location `l_to` following direction `d`.
- Location `l_to` is a goal location.

Let me check if these preconditions are met:
- `player1` will be at `pos43` after move 1.
- `stone1` is at `pos33`.
- `pos23` is clear.
- Can you get from `pos43` to `pos33` following `dirleft`? Looking at the world state: "You may move from location pos43 to location pos33 following direction dirleft". So yes.
- Can you get from `pos33` to `pos23` following `dirleft`? Looking at the world state: "You may move from location pos33 to location pos23 following direction dirleft". So yes.
- Is `pos23` a goal location? Looking at the world state: "pos23 is a goal location". So yes.

All preconditions for the `pushtogoal` action are met, so the plan should work.

So, the final plan is:
1. `move player1 pos53 pos43 dirleft`
2. `pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos33 pos23 dirleft`

But wait, let me double-check about the directions again. I think I might be misunderstanding.

Based on the provided moves, let's map what the directions actually mean:

"You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright" means moving from row 1, column 1 to row 2, column 1. So dirright means moving down a row.

"You may move from location pos11 to location pos12 following direction dirdown" means moving from row 1, column 1 to row 1, column 2. So dirdown means moving right a column.

"You may move from location pos12 to location pos11 following direction dirup" means moving from row 1, column 2 to row 1, column 1. So dirup means moving left a column.

"You may move from location pos21 to location pos11 following direction dirleft" means moving from row 2, column 1 to row 1, column 1. So dirleft means moving up a row.

What's a bit counterintuitive to me is the direction naming. It seems like:

- `dirright` means moving "right" on the grid when viewing the grid with rows increasing from left to right. But if rows increase from top to bottom, it means moving down. (Row increases by 1)
- `dirdown` means moving "down" on the grid when viewing the grid with columns increasing from top to bottom. But if columns increase from left to right, it means moving right. (Column increases by 1)
- `dirup` means moving "up" on the grid when viewing the grid with columns increasing from top to bottom. But if columns increase from left to right, it means moving left. (Column decreases by 1)
- `dirleft` means moving "left" on the grid when viewing the grid with rows increasing from left to right. But if rows increase from top to bottom, it means moving up. (Row decreases by 1)

Actually, let's revise out grid:

```
   1  2  3  4  5
1 11 12 13 14 15
2 21 22 23 24 25  (23 is a goal location)
3 31 32 33 34 35  (33 has stone1)
4 41 42 43 44 45
5 51 52 53 54 55  (53 has player1)
```

This makes it clearer I think.

So, to move the player from position `pos53` (row 5, column 3) to position `pos43` (row 4, column 3), we need to move up a row. This means using the direction `dirleft`.

And to push the stone from position `pos33` (row 3, column 3) to position `pos23` (row 2, column 3), we need to move it up a row, which also means using the direction `dirleft`.

Again, I'm checking:

Can we move from `pos53` to `pos43` following `dirleft`? Looking at the world state, we have "You may move from location pos53 to location pos43 following direction dirleft". So yes.

If the player is now at `pos43`, can we push the stone from `pos33` to `pos23` following `dirleft`?

Looking at the world state:
- Can we move from `pos43` to `pos33` following `dirleft`? Yes, we have "You may move from location pos43 to location pos33 following direction dirleft".
- Can we move from `pos33` to `pos23` following `dirleft`? Yes, we have "You may move from location pos33 to location pos23 following direction dirleft".
- Is `pos23` a goal location? Yes, we have "pos23 is a goal location".

So, the plan holds:
1. `move player1 pos53 pos43 dirleft`
2. `pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos33 pos23 dirleft`

Actually, do I need to make sure "Location pos33 is clear" and "Location pos53 is clear"?

The state says these locations are clear, but there's also a player at `pos53` and a stone at `pos33`.

It seems like there's a potential inconsistency in the state description. Let me double check our starting state:

- `player1` is at `pos53`
- `stone1` is at `pos33`
- Many locations are clear, including `pos33` and `pos53`.

According to the state, both `pos33` and `pos53` are clear, even though they contain the player and stone. This seems contradictory. Either the state is inconsistent, or "clear" might mean something different in this context, or the state description might be incorrect.

Actually, looking at the very end of the state description again, I see:
```
"Location pos33 is clear"
"Location pos53 is clear"
```

But these contradict the earlier statements:
```
"player1 is at location pos53"
"stone1 is at location pos33"
```

I think I've misunderstood something, or there's an error in the state description. Let me reread the actions and their preconditions carefully:

For `move p l_from l_to d`:
- Agent `p` is at location `l_from`.
- Location `l_to` is clear.
- You can get from location `l_from` to location `l_to` following direction `d`.

For `pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d`:
- Agent `p` is at location `l_p`.
- Stone `s` is at location `l_from`.
- Location `l_to` is clear.
- ... (other conditions) ...

Oh, I think it's saying location `l_to` is clear when describing the world, not `l_from`. So, for a location to be "clear" means it doesn't have an agent or a stone. In our state, `pos53` is NOT clear (it contains the player), and `pos33` is NOT clear (it contains the stone). The state description seems to list many locations that ARE clear, but it shouldn't include `pos53` and `pos33` among them.

Rereading, I see that "Location pos33 is clear" is at the very end of the state. Perhaps there might be an error in my understanding or in the state description. Given the earlier statements that the player is at `pos53` and the stone is at `pos33`, it doesn't make sense for these locations to also be clear.

For now, I'll just assume the correct state is that the player is at `pos53` and the stone is at `pos33`, and proceed with the plan:

1. `move player1 pos53 pos43 dirleft`
2. `pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos33 pos23 dirleft`

Let me trace through the effects:

After action 1:
- `player1` is not at `pos53`.
- `pos43` is not clear.
- `player1` is at `pos43`.
- `pos53` is clear.

Now, for action 2, we need to check the preconditions again:
- `player1` is at `pos43`. Check.
- `stone1` is at `pos33`. Check.
- `pos23` is clear. Check.
- Can we get from `pos43` to `pos33` following `dirleft`? Looking at the world state, we have "You may move from location pos43 to location pos33 following direction dirleft". So, check.
- Can we get from `pos33` to `pos23` following `dirleft`? Looking at the world state, we have "You may move from location pos33 to location pos23 following direction dirleft". So, check.
- Is `pos23` a goal location? Looking at the world state, we have "pos23 is a goal location". So, check.

After action 2:
- `player1` is not at `pos43`.
- `stone1` is not at `pos33`.
- `pos23` is not clear.
- `player1` is at `pos33`.
- `stone1` is at `pos23`.
- `pos43` is clear.
- `stone1` is at a goal state.

This achieves our goal. So, the final plan is:

1. `move player1 pos53 pos43 dirleft`
2. `pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos33 pos23 dirleft`

Just to extra double check: When we push the stone from `pos33` to `pos23`, we're using the action "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos33 pos23 dirleft". This says: the player is at `pos43`, there's a stone at `pos33`, and if you go from the player's position to the stone's position using `dirleft`, then continue in the same direction, you'd reach `pos23`. Is this correct?

Reading the preconditions again for the pushtogoal, this seems right. When the player is at `pos43` and the stone at `pos33`, moving one step in the `dirleft` direction (up) takes you from `pos43` to `pos33`.

And moving another step in the `dirleft` direction (up) from `pos33` brings you to `pos23`, which is a goal location.

So the plan looks good.

1. `move player1 pos53 pos43 dirleft`
2. `pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos33 pos23 dirleft`

Final double check: I note that the state tells us that "Location pos33 is clear" and "Location pos53 is clear", but these contradict with the facts that `player1` is at `pos53` and `stone1` is at `pos33`. Given the preconditions of the actions, I'm going to trust the statements about the player and stone locations over the "clear" statements. Otherwise, the plan wouldn't be valid. If the initial state truly has both `pos53` and `pos33` as "clear", then there's a problem with the problem description.

So assuming the current state has the player at `pos53` and the stone at `pos33`, I'm confident in the plan:

1. `move player1 pos53 pos43 dirleft`
2. `pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos33 pos23 dirleft`
