Let me start by understanding the problem. We have a 5x5 grid where:
- The agent (player1) is initially at pos42
- A stone (stone1) is initially at pos33
- The goal is to move the stone to a goal location (pos11)

The available actions are:
1. `move p l_from l_to d` - Moving the agent from l_from to l_to in direction d.
2. `pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d` - Agent at l_p pushes stone s from l_from to goal location l_to.
3. `pushtonongoal p s l_p l_from l_to d` - Agent at l_p pushes stone s from l_from to non-goal location l_to.

The directional indicators are:
- dirdown (moving down the grid)
- dirleft (moving left)
- dirright (moving right) 
- dirup (moving up)

Given the grid structure, it seems positions are labeled as posXY where X is the row and Y is the column. So pos11 is the top-left, and pos55 is the bottom-right.

Since the agent starts at pos42 and the stone is at pos33, I need to plan a sequence of moves to:
1. Move the agent to a position adjacent to the stone
2. Push the stone to the goal location (pos11)

Let's first understand the locations. The grid looks like this:

```
11 12 13 14 15
21 22 23 24 25
31 32 33 34 35
41 42 43 44 45
51 52 53 54 55
```

The agent is at pos42:
```
11 12 13 14 15
21 22 23 24 25
31 32 33 34 35
41 A  43 44 45
51 52 53 54 55
```

The stone is at pos33:
```
11 12 13 14 15
21 22 23 24 25
31 32 S  34 35
41 A  43 44 45
51 52 53 54 55
```

The goal is at pos11:
```
G  12 13 14 15
21 22 23 24 25
31 32 S  34 35
41 A  43 44 45
51 52 53 54 55
```

Let's plan the sequence of steps to get the stone to the goal.

First, the agent needs to move adjacent to the stone. Since the agent is at pos42 and the stone is at pos33, the agent needs to move up to pos32, which is left of the stone.

1. `move player1 pos42 pos32 dirleft`

Now the agent is at pos32 and can push the stone. Since the stone needs to go to pos11, it needs to be pushed up and then left. First, let's try to push it to the left, to pos23.

2. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos33 pos23 dirleft`

Now the stone is at pos23 and the agent is at pos33.

Next, the agent needs to move around the stone to push it further left. So it needs to go up to pos23. But this isn't possible since the stone is now at pos23. So the agent needs to go a different route. Let's go up (pos32 to pos22), then left (pos22 to pos21), then down (pos21 to pos31), and then right (pos31 to pos32).

3. `move player1 pos33 pos32 dirup`
4. `move player1 pos32 pos22 dirup`
5. `move player1 pos22 pos21 dirleft`
6. `move player1 pos21 pos31 dirdown`
7. `move player1 pos31 pos32 dirright`
8. `move player1 pos32 pos22 dirup`
9. `move player1 pos22 pos12 dirup`
10. `move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown`
11. `move player1 pos13 pos23 dirright`

Now the agent is at pos23 and can push the stone from pos23 to pos13, continuing its path to the goal.

12. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos23 pos13 dirleft`

Wait, I think I made an error above. When the agent pushes the stone from pos33 to pos23, the agent ends up at pos33, not at pos23. Let me correct the steps.

After step 2, the stone is at pos23 and the agent is at pos33.

3. `move player1 pos33 pos32 dirup`
4. `move player1 pos32 pos22 dirup`
5. `move player1 pos22 pos12 dirup`
6. `move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown`
7. `move player1 pos13 pos23 dirright`

Now the agent is at pos23 and can push the stone from pos23 to pos13.

8. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos23 pos13 dirup`

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Let's reconsider how pushing works.

From what I understand, for pushing the stone, the agent needs to be on the opposite side of the stone's movement direction. For example, if we want to push the stone from pos33 to pos32 (left direction), the agent needs to be at pos34 (right of the stone).

So, let's revisit the plan:

Agent is at pos42 and the stone is at pos33. Let's move the agent to a position where it can push the stone.

1. `move player1 pos42 pos43 dirdown`
2. `move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft`

Now the agent is at pos33 and the stone is also at pos33. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Let me re-evaluate the initial state more carefully.

Let's examine the statements about the stone and agent positions more carefully:
- "player1 is at location pos42"
- "stone1 is at location pos33"
- "Location pos33 is clear"
- "Location pos42 is clear"

These statements seem contradictory. If the agent is at pos42, how can pos42 be clear? Similarly, if the stone is at pos33, how can pos33 be clear? Let me review the actions and their preconditions again.

From the move action's precondition, the location l_to has to be clear. So, if the agent moves from pos42 to another location, pos42 would become clear and the destination would not be clear. 

Looking at the initial state again, it's possible that the initial state is inconsistent, as both agent and stone locations are marked as "clear". Let's assume the correct interpretation is that the agent and stone are at the specified locations, and the "clear" flags for those locations are mistakenly set.

With this interpretation, the agent is at pos42 and the stone is at pos33. To move the stone to the goal location (pos11), the agent needs to first get to a position where it can push the stone.

Let's first correct our understanding of the pushing action. From the preconditions:
"pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": ... (iv) you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d, ...

This suggests that the agent needs to be adjacent to the stone in the direction opposite to the push. For example, to push the stone from pos33 to pos32 (left), the agent needs to be at pos34 (right of the stone).

Given this, let's plan the sequence:

1. `move player1 pos42 pos43 dirdown`
2. `move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft`

Oh right, now I need to consider the fact that the stone is at pos33. So the agent can't move to pos33 directly. Let's reconsider.

The agent is at pos42. To push the stone from pos33 to pos32 (left), the agent needs to be at pos34 (right of the stone).

1. `move player1 pos42 pos43 dirdown`
2. `move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft`

But this doesn't work because the stone is at pos33. Let's see if there's another route.

To push the stone from pos33 to pos32 (left), the agent needs to be at pos34 (right of the stone). Let's move the agent to pos34:

1. `move player1 pos42 pos32 dirleft`
2. `move player1 pos32 pos33 dirdown`

Wait, again, this doesn't work because the stone is at pos33. 

Let's try a different approach. To push the stone from pos33 to pos34 (right), the agent needs to be at pos32 (left of the stone).

1. `move player1 pos42 pos32 dirleft`

Now the agent is at pos32 and can push the stone from pos33 to pos34.

2. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos33 pos34 dirright`

Now the stone is at pos34 and the agent is at pos33.

To push the stone from pos34 to pos24 (up), the agent needs to be at pos44 (down of the stone).

3. `move player1 pos33 pos43 dirright`
4. `move player1 pos43 pos44 dirdown`

Now the agent is at pos44 and can push the stone from pos34 to pos24 (up).

5. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos34 pos24 dirup`

Now the stone is at pos24 and the agent is at pos34.

To push the stone from pos24 to pos14 (up), the agent needs to be at pos34 (down of the stone).

6. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos24 pos14 dirup`

Now the stone is at pos14 and the agent is at pos24.

To push the stone from pos14 to pos13 (left), the agent needs to be at pos15 (right of the stone).

7. `move player1 pos24 pos25 dirdown`
8. `move player1 pos25 pos15 dirup`

Now the agent is at pos15 and can push the stone from pos14 to pos13 (left).

9. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos15 pos14 pos13 dirleft`

Now the stone is at pos13 and the agent is at pos14.

To push the stone from pos13 to pos12 (left), the agent needs to be at pos14 (right of the stone).

10. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos14 pos13 pos12 dirleft`

Now the stone is at pos12 and the agent is at pos13.

To push the stone from pos12 to pos11 (left), the agent needs to be at pos13 (right of the stone).

11. `pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos12 pos11 dirleft`

Now the stone is at pos11, which is the goal location, and the agent is at pos12.

Actually, let's double check before we declare this finished.

Let's relook at the actions and their preconditions for pushing:

"pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": You may only perform this action if (i) agent p is at location l_p, (ii) stone s is at location l_from, (iii) location l_to is clear, (iv) you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d, (v) you can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d, and (vi) location l_to is a goal location.

So, for the agent to push the stone from location l_from to location l_to, the agent must be at location l_p, and the agent must be able to move from l_p to l_from in direction d. Similarly, the stone must be able to move from l_from to l_to in the same direction d.

Let's re-examine the step:

11. `pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos12 pos11 dirleft`

Here, the agent is at pos13 and wants to push the stone from pos12 to pos11. For this to work, the agent should be able to move from pos13 to pos12 in direction dirleft, and the stone should be able to move from pos12 to pos11 in direction dirleft.

Given the description of the problem, it's not entirely clear if the direction indicates the agent's movement or the stone's movement. However, for the action to be well-defined, both the agent and the stone should move in the same direction d.

Considering the layout of the grid:

```
11 12 13 14 15
21 22 23 24 25
31 32 33 34 35
41 42 43 44 45
51 52 53 54 55
```

For the agent to move from pos13 to pos12, the direction would be dirup. For the stone to move from pos12 to pos11, the direction would be dirleft.

This inconsistency makes me doubtful about my understanding. Let me revisit the description of the problem and the grid layout.

Wait, I think I've been thinking about the grid incorrectly. Based on the description of possible moves, the grid is more like:

```
51 52 53 54 55
41 42 43 44 45
31 32 33 34 35
21 22 23 24 25
11 12 13 14 15
```

No, it's more complicated. Let's check some of the provided moves to understand the grid layout:

- "You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright"
- "You may move from location pos11 to location pos12 following direction dirdown"
- "You may move from location pos21 to location pos11 following direction dirleft"
- "You may move from location pos21 to location pos31 following direction dirright"
- "You may move from location pos21 to location pos22 following direction dirdown"

So it seems that:
- dirright: Increases the first digit (1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5)
- dirdown: Increases the second digit (1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5)
- dirleft: Decreases the first digit (5 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1)
- dirup: Decreases the second digit (5 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1)

This suggests the grid is more like:

```
11 21 31 41 51
12 22 32 42 52
13 23 33 43 53
14 24 34 44 54
15 25 35 45 55
```

OK, this seems right. Pos11 (top-left corner) is the goal, the stone is at pos33, and the player is at pos42.

Let's redo the plan:

1. `move player1 pos42 pos32 dirleft`
2. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos33 pos23 dirleft`

Now the stone is at pos23 and the agent is at pos33.

To push the stone further, the agent now needs to go to a position where it can push. To push the stone from pos23 to pos13 (left), the agent needs to be at pos33 (right of the stone).

3. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos23 pos13 dirleft`

Now the stone is at pos13 and the agent is at pos23. To push the stone from pos13 to the goal (pos11), the agent needs to be able to push it to the left and then up. First, let's move the agent to a position where it can push the stone upwards.

To push the stone from pos13 to pos12 (up), the agent needs to be at pos14 (down of the stone). So the agent needs to move:

4. `move player1 pos23 pos24 dirdown`
5. `move player1 pos24 pos14 dirleft`

Now the agent is at pos14 and can push the stone from pos13 to pos12.

6. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos14 pos13 pos12 dirup`

Now the stone is at pos12 and the agent is at pos13. To push the stone from pos12 to pos11 (left), the agent needs to be at pos22 (right of the stone). So the agent needs to move:

7. `move player1 pos13 pos23 dirright`
8. `move player1 pos23 pos22 dirup`

Now the agent is at pos22 and can push the stone from pos12 to pos11.

9. `pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos12 pos11 dirleft`

But this is wrong again. Direction here indicates the relationship, not the actual movement. So dirup means moving from a higher y-value to a lower y-value, not the actual direction of the push.

Let's re-do all of this.

First, let's clarify the grid representation one more time:

```
   1  2  3  4  5
1 11 21 31 41 51
2 12 22 32 42 52
3 13 23 33 43 53
4 14 24 34 44 54
5 15 25 35 45 55
```

So the grid coordinates are (row, column) with the top-left being (1, 1) and the bottom-right being (5, 5).

Based on the provided moves, it seems that the directions are:
- dirright: Move from a position with a lower first digit to a position with a higher first digit (move from left to right)
- dirdown: Move from a position with a lower second digit to a position with a higher second digit (move from top to bottom)
- dirleft: Move from a position with a higher first digit to a position with a lower first digit (move from right to left)
- dirup: Move from a position with a higher second digit to a position with a lower second digit (move from bottom to top)

Now, let's revisit our plan:

1. Agent starts at pos42 (4th row, 2nd column)
2. Stone is at pos33 (3rd row, 3rd column)
3. Goal is at pos11 (1st row, 1st column)

First, let's move the agent to a position where it can push the stone in the direction of the goal.

1. `move player1 pos42 pos43 dirright`
2. `move player1 pos43 pos33 dirup`

This plan doesn't make sense because the stone is at pos33. The agent and the stone cannot be at the same position.

Let's think about the action. For the pushing action:

"pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": ... (iv) you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d, ...

This means that the agent at l_p can push a stone at l_from to l_to if there's a path from l_p to l_from in direction d. For example, if the agent is at pos23 and the stone is at pos33, the agent can push the stone in the right direction if there's a path from pos23 to pos33 in the right direction, which there is.

Let's look at a concrete example to ensure I understand:

If the agent is at pos23 (row 2, column 3) and the stone is at pos33 (row 3, column 3), to push the stone from pos33 to pos43 (row 4, column 3), the agent would use the action:

`pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos33 pos43 dirdown`

This is because the agent is at pos23, the stone is at pos33, and the agent can move from pos23 to pos33 in the dirdown direction. Similarly, the stone can move from pos33 to pos43 in the dirdown direction.

OK, let's redo our plan with this understanding.

1. Agent starts at pos42 (4th row, 2nd column)
2. Stone is at pos33 (3rd row, 3rd column)
3. Goal is at pos11 (1st row, 1st column)

To push the stone from pos33 towards the goal (pos11), we first need to move it towards the top-left. The agent should position itself to push the stone to the left first.

Step 1: Move the agent to pos43, where it can push the stone to the left.
`move player1 pos42 pos43 dirright`

Step 2: Push the stone from pos33 to pos23 (left).
`pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos33 pos23 dirleft`

Now the stone is at pos23 and the agent is at pos33.

Step 3: Move the agent to pos24, where it can push the stone up.
`move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown`
`move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft`

Step 4: Push the stone from pos23 to pos13 (up).
`pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos23 pos13 dirup`

Now the stone is at pos13 and the agent is at pos23.

Step 5: Move the agent to pos14, where it can push the stone further left.
`move player1 pos23 pos24 dirdown`
`move player1 pos24 pos14 dirleft`

Step 6: Push the stone from pos13 to pos12 (left).
`pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos14 pos13 pos12 dirleft`

Now the stone is at pos12 and the agent is at pos13.

Step 7: Push the stone from pos12 to pos11 (left).
`pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos12 pos11 dirleft`

Wait, I think I'm still misunderstanding the grid layout and the directions.

Trying to interpret from the provided legal moves:

"You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright"
"You may move from location pos11 to location pos12 following direction dirdown"

This suggests that pos21 is to the right of pos11 and pos12 is below pos11. So the grid might be:

```
11 21 31 41 51
12 22 32 42 52
13 23 33 43 53
14 24 34 44 54
15 25 35 45 55
```

Where the first digit indicates the column, and the second digit indicates the row. So pos33 is in the 3rd column, 3rd row.

But I'm noticing another relationship here. It seems like the two positions in a legal move are adjacent to each other. So if the grid is as I've drawn, and positions are formatted as 'column row', then I can clarify the directions:

- dirright: Move from a position with a lower first digit to a position with a higher first digit (move from left to right)
- dirdown: Move from a position with a lower second digit to a position with a higher second digit (move from top to bottom)
- dirleft: Move from a position with a higher first digit to a position with a lower first digit (move from right to left)
- dirup: Move from a position with a higher second digit to a position with a lower second digit (move from bottom to top)

Given this understanding, let's revisit the plan.

1. Agent starts at pos42 (column 4, row 2)
2. Stone is at pos33 (column 3, row 3)
3. Goal is at pos11 (column 1, row 1)

So, we want to move the stone from (3, 3) to (1, 1).

Step 1: Push the stone from (3, 3) to (3, 2).
To do this, the agent should be at (3, 4), pushing upwards.

`move player1 pos42 pos43 dirdown`
`move player1 pos43 pos34 dirleft`

Now the agent is at (3, 4) and can push the stone from (3, 3) to (3, 2) (up).

`pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos33 pos32 dirup`

Now the stone is at (3, 2) and the agent is at (3, 3).

Step 2: Push the stone from (3, 2) to (2, 2).
To do this, the agent should be at (4, 2), pushing to the left.

`move player1 pos33 pos43 dirright`
`move player1 pos43 pos42 dirup`

Now the agent is at (4, 2) and can push the stone from (3, 2) to (2, 2) (left).

`pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos22 dirleft`

Now the stone is at (2, 2) and the agent is at (3, 2).

But wait, there's another complication. When I push the stone, the agent takes the stone's previous position. So I'm not sure if I'm tracing the agent's position correctly. Let me re-read the affects of the pushing actions.

"pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": ... After performing this action, (i) agent p is no longer at location l_p, (ii) stone s is no longer at location l_from, (iii) location l_to is no longer clear, (iv) agent p is at location l_from, (v) stone s is at location l_to, (vi) location l_p is clear, and (vi) stone s is at a goal state.

Ok, after pushing, the stone goes to the target position, and the agent goes to the stone's previous position. 

Certainly, in the first step, of pushing the stone from pos33 to pos32, the agent winds up at pos33. In the next step, the agent would then be at pos33 and might not be able to push the stone in the desired direction in the next step. I need to revise the plan.

Let's restart our plan:

1. `move player1 pos42 pos43 dirdown`
2. `move player1 pos43 pos34 dirleft`
3. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos33 pos32 dirup`

Now the stone is at pos32 and the agent is at pos33.

To push the stone further, the agent needs to reposition. To push the stone from pos32 to pos22 (left), the agent needs to be at pos42, pushing from the right.

4. `move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown`
5. `move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright`
6. `move player1 pos44 pos43 dirup`
7. `move player1 pos43 pos42 dirleft`

Now the agent is at pos42 and can push the stone from pos32 to pos22 (left).

8. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos22 dirleft`

Now the stone is at pos22 and the agent is at pos32.

To push the stone from pos22 to pos21 (up), the agent needs to be at pos23, pushing from below.

9. `move player1 pos32 pos33 dirdown`
10. `move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft`

Now the agent is at pos23 and can push the stone from pos22 to pos21 (up).

11. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos22 pos21 dirup`

Now the stone is at pos21 and the agent is at pos22.

To push the stone from pos21 to pos11 (left), the agent needs to be at pos31, pushing from the right.

12. `move player1 pos22 pos23 dirdown`
13. `move player1 pos23 pos33 dirright`
14. `move player1 pos33 pos32 dirup`
15. `move player1 pos32 pos31 dirleft`

Now the agent is at pos31 and can push the stone from pos21 to pos11 (left).

16. `pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos21 pos11 dirleft`

Now the stone is at pos11, which is the goal location, and the agent is at pos21.

Let's summarize the steps:

1. `move player1 pos42 pos43 dirdown`
2. `move player1 pos43 pos34 dirleft`
3. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos33 pos32 dirup`
4. `move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown`
5. `move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright`
6. `move player1 pos44 pos43 dirup`
7. `move player1 pos43 pos42 dirleft`
8. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos22 dirleft`
9. `move player1 pos32 pos33 dirdown`
10. `move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft`
11. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos22 pos21 dirup`
12. `move player1 pos22 pos23 dirdown`
13. `move player1 pos23 pos33 dirright`
14. `move player1 pos33 pos32 dirup`
15. `move player1 pos32 pos31 dirleft`
16. `pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos21 pos11 dirleft`

Wait, one more check. When pushes, the direction is the direction the agent is pushing from. So from the preconditions:

"pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": ... (iv) you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d, ...

This means the agent at l_p is pushing the stone at l_from to l_to, and the agent can reach the stone following direction d. For instance, if the agent is at (3, 4) and the stone is at (3, 3), and the agent wants to push the stone to (3, 2), the direction is dirup (moving from pos34 to pos33, which is from a higher second digit to a lower second digit).

Step 3 in the plan should be:

3. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos33 pos32 dirup`

And similarly, step 8 should be:

8. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos22 dirleft`

Step 11:

11. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos22 pos21 dirup`

And step 16:

16. `pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos21 pos11 dirleft`

These look right.

Actually, let me just do a final pass on the path to see if we can reduce the number of steps:

1. `move player1 pos42 pos43 dirdown`
2. `move player1 pos43 pos34 dirleft`
3. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos33 pos32 dirup`
4. `move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown`
5. `move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright`
6. `move player1 pos44 pos43 dirup`
7. `move player1 pos43 pos42 dirleft`
8. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos22 dirleft`
9. `move player1 pos32 pos33 dirdown`
10. `move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft`
11. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos22 pos21 dirup`
12. `move player1 pos22 pos23 dirdown`
13. `move player1 pos23 pos33 dirright`
14. `move player1 pos33 pos32 dirup`
15. `move player1 pos32 pos31 dirleft`
16. `pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos21 pos11 dirleft`

Hm, I think steps 4-7 can be improved. After pushing the stone from pos33 to pos32, the agent is at pos33. To push the stone from pos32 to pos22, the agent can also approach from the right, but it doesn't necessarily have to go through pos42. It could go through pos41, for instance. Let's try to optimize:

1. `move player1 pos42 pos43 dirdown`
2. `move player1 pos43 pos34 dirleft`
3. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos33 pos32 dirup`

Now the stone is at pos32 and the agent is at pos33.

To push the stone from pos32 to pos22 (left), the agent can approach from the right by going through pos41 or pos42 or pos43. Let's choose the one that minimizes steps.

4. `move player1 pos33 pos43 dirright`
5. `move player1 pos43 pos42 dirup`
6. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos22 dirleft`

Now the stone is at pos22 and the agent is at pos32.

To push the stone from pos22 to pos21 (up), the agent needs to be at pos23, pushing from below.

7. `move player1 pos32 pos33 dirdown`
8. `move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft`
9. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos22 pos21 dirup`

Now the stone is at pos21 and the agent is at pos22.

To push the stone from pos21 to pos11 (left), the agent needs to be at pos31, pushing from the right.

10. `move player1 pos22 pos32 dirright`
11. `move player1 pos32 pos31 dirleft`
12. `pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos21 pos11 dirleft`

This plan has 12 steps, which is a bit shorter.

Let's verify this plan step-by-step:

1. Agent starts at pos42, stone at pos33, goal at pos11.
2. Agent moves to pos43.
3. Agent moves to pos34.
4. Agent pushes stone from pos33 to pos32, and agent ends up at pos33.
5. Agent moves to pos43.
6. Agent moves to pos42.
7. Agent pushes stone from pos32 to pos22, and agent ends up at pos32.
8. Agent moves to pos33.
9. Agent moves to pos23.
10. Agent pushes stone from pos22 to pos21, and agent ends up at pos22.
11. Agent moves to pos32.
12. Agent moves to pos31.
13. Agent pushes stone from pos21 to pos11, and agent ends up at pos21.

The stone is at pos11, which is the goal. The plan is valid.

However, I realized I made a mistake. I accidentally left out step 11 (the move from pos22 to pos32) in my previous enumeration. So the total number of steps is 13, not 12.

Let's re-list them:

1. `move player1 pos42 pos43 dirdown`
2. `move player1 pos43 pos34 dirleft`
3. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos33 pos32 dirup`
4. `move player1 pos33 pos43 dirright`
5. `move player1 pos43 pos42 dirup`
6. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos22 dirleft`
7. `move player1 pos32 pos33 dirdown`
8. `move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft`
9. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos22 pos21 dirup`
10. `move player1 pos22 pos32 dirright`
11. `move player1 pos32 pos31 dirleft`
12. `pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos21 pos11 dirleft`

Hmm, I miscounted. It's 12 steps, not 13.

Let me verify if I can further optimize. After step 9, the agent is at pos22 and the stone is at pos21. To push the stone to pos11, the agent needs to be at pos31. There might be a more direct route from pos22 to pos31 than going via pos32. Let's see:

Possible routes from pos22 to pos31:
1. pos22 -> pos32 -> pos31: 2 steps
2. pos22 -> pos21 -> pos31: 2 steps

So both routes have the same number of steps. But one issue is that the stone is at pos21, so the agent can't move to pos21. So the route via pos32 is the only viable one.

I think the current plan is optimal.

Let's quickly check the goal again. We needed to move stone1 to a goal location. The only goal location is pos11. In the final state of our plan, stone1 is at pos11, so the goal is achieved.

Let me double-check the plan once more:

1. `move player1 pos42 pos43 dirdown`
2. `move player1 pos43 pos34 dirleft`
3. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos33 pos32 dirup`
4. `move player1 pos33 pos43 dirright`
5. `move player1 pos43 pos42 dirup`
6. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos32 pos22 dirleft`
7. `move player1 pos32 pos33 dirdown`
8. `move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft`
9. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos22 pos21 dirup`
10. `move player1 pos22 pos32 dirright`
11. `move player1 pos32 pos31 dirleft`
12. `pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos21 pos11 dirleft`

This plan is optimal within the constraints of the problem and should solve the task.
