Okay, so I need to solve this planning problem where the agent has to move a stone to a goal location. Let's see the details.

First, the initial state: The agent (player1) is at pos42. The stone (stone1) is at pos33. The only goal location mentioned is pos11. All other locations are non-goal. So the goal is to get stone1 to a goal location, which is pos11, since that's the only one specified as a goal.

Wait, looking back, the original state says "pos11 is a goal location" and all others are not. So yes, the goal is to have stone1 at pos11. But wait, the task's goal is "stone1 is at a goal location". So pos11 is the only goal location, so we need to get stone1 there.

Now, the agent starts at pos42. Stone1 is at pos33. The path from agent's position to the stone's position: Let's see the movement possibilities.

Pos42: The agent can move to pos32 (dirleft), pos52 (dirright), pos41 (dirup), or pos43 (dirdown). But pos43 is clear. So maybe moving up or down first. Wait, the agent needs to reach pos33 where the stone is. Let's map the path from pos42 to pos33.

Looking at the movement connections. Let me try to find a path. From pos42, possible moves:

- dirleft to pos32 (if that's allowed). Let's check the connections. The original state says "You may move from location pos42 to location pos32 following direction dirleft". Yes, so the agent can move left from pos42 to pos32. Then from pos32, where can it go? pos32 can go to pos22 (dirleft), pos42 (dirright), pos31 (dirup), or pos33 (dirdown). Oh! From pos32, moving dirdown would take the agent to pos33. But pos33 is where the stone is. So to push the stone, the agent needs to be adjacent to it in the direction opposite to where they want to push. Wait, the stone is at pos33. So to push it, the agent needs to be in a position adjacent to pos33 and then push it in a direction.

Wait, the pushtogoal action's preconditions: The agent must be at l_p, which is adjacent to l_from (where the stone is) via direction d. Because "you can get from l_p to l_from following direction d". So for example, if the agent is at pos32 (which is above pos33), and the stone is at pos33, then the direction from pos32 to pos33 is dirdown. So the agent can push the stone down, but that would require l_to to be pos34 (since from pos33 moving dirdown would go to pos34). But pos34 is a non-goal location. So to push to a goal, the direction must be towards a goal location. But pos11 is the only goal, which is far away.

Alternatively, maybe the stone needs to be pushed all the way to pos11. Let's see the path from pos33 to pos11. The grid is 5x5. pos11 is the top-left corner. pos33 is in the middle. So the agent needs to move the stone up and left multiple times.

But pushing the stone requires the agent to be adjacent to it each time. Let's think step by step.

First, the agent is at pos42. To reach the stone at pos33, the agent needs to move to a position adjacent to pos33. Let's see possible adjacent positions to pos33. The adjacent locations would be pos23 (left), pos43 (right), pos32 (up), and pos34 (down). Wait, according to the movement connections:

From pos33, you can move to pos23 (dirleft), pos43 (dirright), pos32 (dirup), or pos34 (dirdown). So the agent can be in any of those positions to push the stone.

So the agent is starting at pos42. Let's plan the path to get adjacent to the stone.

From pos42, the agent can move left to pos32 (dirleft). Then from pos32, move down to pos33? Wait, no, the movement is for the agent. The agent can move from pos32 to pos33 only if that's allowed. Wait, the movement connections: "You may move from location pos32 to location pos33 following direction dirdown". Wait, but moving down from pos32 would take the agent to pos33. But pos33 currently has the stone. So the agent can't move there because the location is not clear. Because in the initial state, pos33 has the stone, so it's not clear. So the agent can't move into pos33 directly.

Therefore, the agent needs to navigate around to get adjacent to the stone. Let's think again.

The agent is at pos42. The stone is at pos33. The agent needs to get to a position adjacent to the stone (pos33) to push it. Possible adjacent positions: pos32 (up), pos34 (down), pos23 (left), pos43 (right).

Let's see which of these are reachable. Let's try to get to pos43. From pos42, moving down (dirdown) to pos43. Is pos43 clear? Yes, initial state says "Location pos43 is clear". So the agent can move from pos42 to pos43 via dirdown. Then, from pos43, can the agent move left to pos33? Let's check movement connections. "You may move from location pos43 to location pos33 following direction dirleft". Yes. But pos33 is occupied by the stone. So the agent can't move there. So the agent can't go to pos33, but can be at pos43, which is adjacent to pos33 (right side). So if the agent is at pos43, then the stone is at pos33. So the agent can push the stone left from pos33 to pos23 (dirleft), but pos23 is a non-goal. Or push it up to pos32 (dirup) from pos33, but that would require the agent to be at pos34 (south of pos33) to push up? Wait, the directions might be a bit confusing here. Let me clarify the direction definitions.

The directions are dirup, dirdown, dirleft, dirright. So if the agent is at pos43 (to the right of pos33) and wants to push the stone left (dirleft), then the agent's position l_p is pos43, the stone is at l_from pos33. The direction from l_p (pos43) to l_from (pos33) is dirleft. Then, pushing the stone from pos33 to pos23 (dirleft again), since the direction from l_from (pos33) to l_to (pos23) is dirleft. So the action would be pushtonongoal (since pos23 is non-goal) or pushtogoal if pos23 were a goal. But pos23 is not a goal. However, our target is to get the stone to pos11, which is a goal. So pushing it left from pos33 to pos23 would be a step towards the left, but how to get it all the way up.

Alternatively, if the agent is at pos32 (above pos33), then the direction from pos32 to pos33 is dirdown. Then the agent can push the stone down to pos34 (which is non-goal), but that's moving it away from the goal. Not helpful. Or, if the agent is at pos34 (south of pos33), direction dirdown would be from pos34 to pos44, but that's not adjacent to the stone. Wait, maybe I'm mixing directions. Let's think again.

The direction is the direction from the agent's position to the stone's position. For example, if the agent is at pos32 (north of pos33), the direction from pos32 to pos33 is dirdown. Then, pushing the stone would require moving in a direction from pos33. For example, pushing the stone from pos33 to pos23 (dirleft) would require the agent to be at pos33's right (pos43) and push left. Wait, maybe it's easier to map each possible push.

Let me outline possible pushes:

Case 1: Agent is at pos43 (right of stone at pos33). Direction from agent to stone is dirleft. So the agent can push the stone left (dirleft) to pos23. But pos23 is non-goal, so action would be pushtonongoal. But that would move the stone left, closer to pos11. That's a step in the right direction.

Case 2: Agent is at pos23 (left of stone). Direction from agent to stone is dirright. Then push the stone right (dirright) to pos33 (but that's where it is now). Not useful.

Case 3: Agent is at pos32 (north of stone). Direction from agent to stone is dirdown. Then push the stone down to pos34 (non-goal), which is moving away from the goal. Not helpful.

Case 4: Agent is at pos34 (south of stone). Direction from agent to stone is dirup. Then push the stone up to pos33 (current position). Not helpful.

So the best option is to push the stone left from pos33 to pos23, which moves it closer to pos11. So how to get the agent to pos43 to do that.

Agent starts at pos42. Let's move to pos43. Action: move player1 pos42 pos43 dirdown. Because pos43 is clear. Then, from pos43, push the stone left to pos23. But wait, to push from pos33 to pos23, the agent must be at pos43 (l_p=pos43), l_from=pos33, l_to=pos23, direction=dirleft. Preconditions check:

- Agent is at l_p (pos43). Yes.
- Stone is at l_from (pos33). Yes.
- l_to (pos23) is clear. According to initial state, pos23 is clear. Yes.
- Can move from l_p (pos43) to l_from (pos33) following direction dirleft. Check movement connections: pos43 can move to pos33 via dirleft? Yes, according to the connections: "You may move from location pos43 to location pos33 following direction dirleft".
- Can move from l_from (pos33) to l_to (pos23) via direction dirleft. Checking movement connections: pos33 can move to pos23 via dirleft. Yes: "You may move from location pos33 to location pos23 following direction dirleft".
- l_to (pos23) is not a goal. Correct. So the action would be pushtonongoal.

So after moving to pos43, the agent can perform pushtonongoal to move stone1 from pos33 to pos23. Then the stone is at pos23. Now, the agent is at pos33 (since after pushing, the agent moves to l_from, which is pos33). But pos33 is now clear because the stone was moved. Wait, no: after the pushtonongoal action, the effects are:

- Agent p is no longer at pos43 (l_p).
- Stone s is no longer at pos33 (l_from).
- l_to (pos23) is no longer clear.
- Agent p is now at pos33 (l_from).
- Stone is at pos23 (l_to).
- pos43 (l_p) becomes clear.
- Stone is at non-goal state.

So after this action, the agent is at pos33, and the stone is at pos23. Now, the next step is to push the stone further towards pos11.

Now, the stone is at pos23. The agent is at pos33. The goal is to push the stone from pos23 to pos13 (left), then to pos12 (up?), then to pos11 (left). Wait, pos13 is not a goal, but pos11 is. So the path would be pos23 → pos13 → pos12 → pos11. Let's see.

From pos23, pushing left would take it to pos13 (if possible). Let's plan how to get the agent into position to push the stone from pos23 to pos13.

Current state after first push:

- Agent at pos33.
- Stone at pos23.
- pos23 is not clear (stone is there).
- pos33 is clear (since agent is there now? Wait, no. After the push, the agent moves to l_from (pos33). So pos33 now has the agent. So pos33 is not clear. So the agent is at pos33.

So the agent is at pos33. Stone is at pos23. To push the stone from pos23 to pos13, the agent needs to be adjacent to pos23 in the direction opposite to the push. For example, if the agent is to the right of the stone (pos23's right is pos24?), wait, pos23 is at row 2, column3. Adjacent positions would be pos13 (up), pos33 (down), pos22 (left?), pos24 (right). Wait, perhaps the grid is arranged as rows and columns. Let me clarify the positions:

Assuming posXY where X is row and Y is column. So pos11 is row 1, column1; pos12 is row1, column2; pos21 is row2, column1; etc.

So pos23 is row2, column3. Adjacent positions:

- Up: pos13 (row1, column3)
- Down: pos33 (row3, column3)
- Left: pos22 (row2, column2)
- Right: pos24 (row2, column4)

So to push the stone from pos23 to pos13 (up), the agent needs to be at pos33 (south of pos23) and push up. But wait, the direction from agent's position to stone's position would be dirup. Wait, no. If the stone is at pos23, and the agent is at pos33 (south), the direction from agent to stone is dirup. So pushing the stone from pos23 to pos13 (dirup) would require:

- Agent is at l_p (pos33)
- Stone is at l_from (pos23)
- l_to is pos13 (dirup from pos23)
- Check movement from l_p (pos33) to l_from (pos23): direction is dirup. Wait, pos33 is row3, column3. pos23 is row2, column3. So moving from pos33 to pos23 is dirup. So direction is dirup.
- Then, movement from l_from (pos23) to l_to (pos13) is dirup. So the action would be pushtonongoal (since pos13 is not a goal).

But first, the agent needs to move from pos33 to a position adjacent to pos23 to push it up. Wait, the agent is currently at pos33. To push the stone at pos23 up to pos13, the agent needs to be south of the stone (pos23) to push north. Wait, but the agent is at pos33, which is south of pos23. So the agent can push the stone from pos23 to pos13 (up) by being at pos33 and pushing up. Let's check the movement possibilities.

The movement from agent's position (pos33) to stone's position (pos23) must be possible. According to the movement connections: "You may move from location pos33 to location pos23 following direction dirup". Yes, that's listed. So the agent can move from pos33 to pos23 via dirup, but pos23 is currently occupied by the stone, so the agent can't move there. However, for the push action, the agent doesn't need to move there, but needs to be adjacent. Wait, the preconditions for pushtonongoal are:

(i) agent p is at l_p (pos33)
(ii) stone s is at l_from (pos23)
(iii) l_to (pos13) is clear
(iv) can get from l_p (pos33) to l_from (pos23) via direction d (dirup)
(v) can get from l_from (pos23) to l_to (pos13) via direction d (dirup)
(vi) l_to is not a goal (pos13 is not a goal)

So all these conditions must be met.

Is pos13 clear? In the initial state, pos13 is clear. After the first push, the stone is at pos23, so pos13 remains clear. So yes. So the agent can perform pushtonongoal to push the stone from pos23 to pos13 via dirup.

So action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos23 pos13 dirup.

After this, the agent moves to pos23 (l_from), which is now clear because the stone was moved. The stone is now at pos13. Now, the agent is at pos23.

Next step: push the stone from pos13 to pos12 (left?) or pos11 (up). Let's see. The goal is pos11, which is row1, column1. So from pos13 (row1, column3), we need to move left twice to pos11.

But how to push the stone from pos13 to pos12 (left) then to pos11 (left again).

Wait, pos13 is row1, column3. Adjacent positions are pos12 (left), pos14 (right), pos23 (down). To get to pos11, the stone needs to go from pos13 → pos12 → pos11.

First, pushing from pos13 to pos12 (left). For that, the agent needs to be at pos14 (east of pos13) to push left, or pos23 (south) to push up, or pos12 (west) but that's where we want to push. Wait, pushing left from pos13 would require the agent to be east of pos13 (pos14), but pos14 is clear. Wait, pos14 is column4, row1. But pos13 is column3, row1. So east is pos14. So agent at pos14 can push left to pos13 → pos12. But first, the agent is at pos23 after the previous push. Need to move to pos14.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a shorter path. Let me think.

After pushing the stone to pos13, the agent is at pos23. The stone is at pos13. Now, the agent needs to get adjacent to pos13 to push it left to pos12.

Possible adjacent positions to pos13: pos12 (left), pos14 (right), pos23 (down), and pos03 (up) which doesn't exist. So the agent can approach from pos23 (down) or pos14 (right), or pos12 (left). But pos12 is where we want to push the stone.

So to push the stone from pos13 to pos12 (left), the agent needs to be at pos14 (east of pos13) and push left. So the direction from agent's position (pos14) to stone's position (pos13) is dirleft. Then, pushing the stone from pos13 to pos12 via dirleft. Let's check:

- Agent is at pos14. Can the agent get there from pos23?

Current agent position: pos23. Need to move to pos14. Let's find a path from pos23 to pos14.

pos23 is row2, column3. pos14 is row1, column4. Path:

pos23 → pos24 (dirright?), then pos24 → pos14 (dirup?).

Wait, movement connections:

From pos23: can move to pos13 (dirup), pos33 (dirdown), pos22 (dirleft), pos24 (dirright). So from pos23, move dirright to pos24.

From pos24, can move to pos14 (dirup), pos34 (dirdown), pos23 (dirleft), pos25 (dirright). So from pos24, move dirup to pos14.

So agent can move:

move player1 pos23 pos24 dirright

Then move player1 pos24 pos14 dirup.

Now, agent is at pos14. Then, push the stone from pos13 to pos12.

Check preconditions:

- Agent is at pos14 (l_p)
- Stone is at pos13 (l_from)
- l_to is pos12 (dirleft from pos13)
- pos12 is clear (initially yes, but after previous actions? Let's track:

After first push, stone is at pos23. Then pushed to pos13. Then agent moved to pos24, then to pos14. So pos12 is clear. So yes.

- Can move from pos14 to pos13 via direction dirleft. Check movement connections: "You may move from location pos14 to location pos13 following direction dirup" no, wait. pos14 is row1, column4. pos13 is row1, column3. So direction from pos14 to pos13 is dirleft. So the movement connection should allow that. Let's check the original connections:

Looking back, the movement connections include "You may move from location pos14 to location pos13 following direction dirup"? Wait no, the connections are:

"You may move from location pos14 to location pos24 following direction dirright"

Wait, no. Let me search the movement connections for pos14.

The original movement connections include:

"You may move from location pos14 to location pos24 following direction dirright" (no, that's pos14 to pos24 is down?)

Wait, the original movement connections are a bit confusing. Let's check:

Looking at the original state's movement connections:

Looking for pos14:

"You may move from location pos14 to location pos24 following direction dirright" — dirright from pos14 would be east, but pos14 is row1, column4. East would be column5, but pos24 is row2, column4. So perhaps directions are not as I thought. Maybe the directions are:

dirup: north

dirdown: south

dirleft: west

dirright: east.

But according to the given movement connections, some movements don't align with that. For example, "You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright". pos11 is row1, column1. pos21 is row2, column1. So moving down (south) would be dirright? That doesn't make sense. Wait, this suggests that the directions might not correspond to the standard cardinal directions. Maybe the directions are different.

Alternatively, perhaps the directions are relative. For example, dirright could mean moving to the next column in the same row, dirleft previous column, dirdown next row, dirup previous row. But then pos11 to pos21 would be dirdown, but the movement connection says dirright. That doesn't fit. This is confusing.

Wait, the movement connections are part of the problem's initial state, so I need to refer to them as given. For example:

The original state includes:

"You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright"

"You may move from location pos11 to location pos12 following direction dirdown"

So pos11 to pos21 is dirright, and to pos12 is dirdown. So dirright from pos11 leads to pos21 (row2, column1), which is south. So in this case, dirright seems to correspond to moving down. That's confusing, but perhaps the directions are named differently. Maybe the directions are named based on the grid's perspective. For example, dirright could correspond to moving down a row, dirleft moving up a row, etc. But this is unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps the directions are named as per the direction you face when moving. For example, if you are at pos11 and move dirright to pos21, perhaps facing right means moving down. But this is hard to track. The key is to rely on the given movement connections as defined in the problem.

This is critical for planning. So for each movement, I need to check the allowed directions as per the problem's initial state.

For example, from pos14 (row1, column4), the movement connections are:

"You may move from location pos14 to location pos24 following direction dirright"

"You may move from location pos14 to location pos13 following direction dirup"

"You may move from location pos14 to location pos15 following direction dirdown"

So from pos14, moving dirright takes you to pos24 (row2, column4), dirup to pos13 (row1, column3), dirdown to pos15 (row1, column5? Wait, pos15 is row1, column5. So yes, moving down (dirdown) from pos14 (row1, column4) to pos15 (row1, column5) would be east. So the directions here are inconsistent with standard directions. It seems that dirright, dirleft, dirup, dirdown are not aligned with cardinal directions but are just labels for specific movements as defined in the problem.

This complicates planning. Therefore, I must carefully check each movement connection.

So back to the problem. After the agent is at pos14, they need to push the stone from pos13 to pos12.

The movement from pos14 to pos13 is allowed via direction dirup (as per the movement connection: "You may move from location pos14 to location pos13 following direction dirup"). So the agent is at pos14 and can move to pos13 via dirup. But pos13 has the stone. So the agent can't move there. However, for the push action, the agent doesn't need to move there; they need to be at pos14 and push the stone from pos13 to pos12 via dirleft.

Wait, no. The push action requires that the agent is at l_p (pos14), the stone is at l_from (pos13), and the direction from l_p to l_from is dirup. Then, the direction from l_from to l_to must be dirleft (to get to pos12). So the action would be pushtonongoal with direction d being dirup (from pos14 to pos13), and then the stone moves dirleft from pos13 to pos12.

Wait, but the movement from pos13 to pos12 must be possible via direction d. Let's check:

The movement connections for pos13 include:

"You may move from location pos13 to location pos23 following direction dirright"

"You may move from location pos13 to location pos12 following direction dirup"

"You may move from location pos13 to location pos14 following direction dirdown"

Wait, according to the given connections:

"You may move from location pos13 to location pos12 following direction dirup"

Wait, so moving from pos13 to pos12 is dirup. So the direction from pos13 to pos12 is dirup. So to push the stone from pos13 to pos12, the direction is dirup.

But the agent is at pos14, pushing the stone at pos13. The direction from pos14 to pos13 is dirup (as per the movement connection). Then, the stone is pushed from pos13 to pos12 via dirup. So the action would be:

pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos14 pos13 pos12 dirup.

Check preconditions:

- Agent at pos14: yes.
- Stone at pos13: yes.
- pos12 clear: yes.
- Can move from pos14 to pos13 via dirup: yes.
- Can move from pos13 to pos12 via dirup: yes (as per movement connections).
- pos12 is not a goal: correct.

So this action is valid. After this, the agent moves to pos13 (l_from), stone moves to pos12. Now, the stone is at pos12. Agent is at pos13.

Next step: push the stone from pos12 to pos11 (the goal). pos12 is row1, column2. pos11 is row1, column1. To push the stone from pos12 to pos11 (dirleft), the agent needs to be east of pos12 (pos13) and push left. So direction from agent's position (pos13) to stone's position (pos12) is dirup (since movement from pos13 to pos12 is dirup according to the connections). Wait, movement from pos13 to pos12 is dirup. So agent is at pos13, stone is at pos12. The direction from agent to stone is dirup. Then pushing the stone from pos12 to pos11 via dirleft.

Wait, the movement from pos12 to pos11 must be possible. Check connections:

"You may move from location pos12 to location pos11 following direction dirup". Yes. So direction dirup from pos12 to pos11. So the action would be pushtogoal, because pos11 is a goal location.

Wait, the stone is being pushed to pos11, which is a goal. So the action is pushtogoal.

But for the action to be valid:

- Agent is at pos13 (l_p)
- Stone is at pos12 (l_from)
- pos11 (l_to) is clear (yes)
- Can move from pos13 to pos12 via dirup (yes)
- Can move from pos12 to pos11 via dirup (yes)
- l_to is a goal (yes)

So action: pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos12 pos11 dirup.

After this, the stone is at pos11 (goal), and the agent is at pos12.

So the plan would be:

1. Move player1 from pos42 to pos43 via dirdown.

2. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos33 pos23 dirleft.

3. Move player1 from pos23 to pos24 via dirright.

4. Move player1 from pos24 to pos14 via dirup.

5. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos14 pos13 pos12 dirup.

6. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos12 pos11 dirup.

But wait, after step 2, the agent is at pos33, not pos23. Wait, no: when you perform a pushtonongoal action, the agent moves from l_p (pos43) to l_from (pos33). So after step 2, the agent is at pos33.

Wait, correction: step 2's action is "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos33 pos23 dirleft". The agent is at pos43 (l_p) before the action. After the action, the agent moves to l_from (pos33). So after step 2, the agent is at pos33. Then, the stone is at pos23.

Then, to push the stone from pos23 to pos13, the agent needs to be at pos33 and perform the action:

pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos23 pos13 dirup.

So step 3: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos23 pos13 dirup.

After this, the agent is at pos23.

Then, the stone is at pos13. To push to pos12, the agent needs to get to pos14. So steps 4 and 5: move from pos23 to pos24 (dirright), then to pos14 (dirup).

Then step 6: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos14 pos13 pos12 dirup.

Then, step 7: pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos12 pos11 dirup.

Wait, but after step 6, the agent is at pos13 (l_from), stone at pos12. Then, to push from pos12 to pos11, the agent is at pos13 and pushes dirup (from pos12 to pos11). So the action would be:

pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos12 pos11 dirup.

This seems to work.

So the plan steps are:

1. move player1 pos42 pos43 dirdown

2. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos33 pos23 dirleft

3. move player1 pos33 pos23 dirup (Wait, no. After step 2, the agent is at pos33. To push the stone from pos23 to pos13, the agent needs to be at pos33 (since pos23 is north of pos33). So step 3 would be:

pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos23 pos13 dirup

But wait, the agent is at pos33, stone is at pos23. The direction from pos33 to pos23 is dirup. The direction from pos23 to pos13 is dirup. So this action is valid.

After this, the agent is at pos23.

Then, the agent needs to move to pos14 to push the stone from pos13 to pos12. Steps:

4. move player1 pos23 pos24 dirright

5. move player1 pos24 pos14 dirup

6. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos14 pos13 pos12 dirup

7. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos12 pos11 dirup

Wait, after step 6, the agent is at pos13. Then, the stone is at pos12. To push to pos11, the agent is at pos13 (l_p), direction from pos13 to pos12 is dirup (per movement connections). Then, pushing the stone from pos12 to pos11 via dirup. So yes.

So this plan should work. Let's check each action's preconditions.

Step 1: move player1 pos42 pos43 dirdown.

Preconditions:

- agent is at pos42: yes.

- pos43 is clear: yes.

- movement allowed: yes (from pos42 to pos43 via dirdown).

Step 2: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos33 pos23 dirleft.

Preconditions:

- agent at pos43: yes (after step 1).

- stone at pos33: yes.

- pos23 clear: yes.

- can move from pos43 to pos33 via dirleft: yes (movement connection exists).

- can move from pos33 to pos23 via dirleft: yes.

- pos23 is not a goal: yes.

Step 3: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos23 pos13 dirup.

Preconditions:

- agent at pos33: yes (after step 2's effect).

- stone at pos23: yes.

- pos13 clear: yes.

- can move from pos33 to pos23 via dirup: yes.

- can move from pos23 to pos13 via dirup: yes.

- pos13 is not a goal: yes.

Step 4: move player1 pos33 to pos23 via dirup. Wait, no. After step 3, the agent is at pos23 (since after pushing, the agent moves to l_from, which is pos23). So step 3's effect moves the agent to pos23. So after step 3, the agent is at pos23, stone at pos13.

So step 4: move from pos23 to pos24 via dirright.

Preconditions:

- agent at pos23: yes.

- pos24 is clear: yes (original state says pos24 is clear, but after any steps? After step 3, pos24 is still clear because the agent moved to pos23, which is different from pos24.

Yes. Movement allowed from pos23 to pos24 via dirright: yes.

Step 5: move player1 pos24 pos14 dirup.

Preconditions:

- agent at pos24: yes.

- pos14 is clear: yes.

- movement allowed: yes (from pos24 to pos14 via dirup).

Step 6: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos14 pos13 pos12 dirup.

Preconditions:

- agent at pos14: yes.

- stone at pos13: yes.

- pos12 clear: yes.

- can move from pos14 to pos13 via dirup: yes.

- can move from pos13 to pos12 via dirup: yes.

- pos12 not a goal: yes.

Step 7: pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos12 pos11 dirup.

Preconditions:

- agent at pos13: yes (after step 6, agent moves to pos13).

- stone at pos12: yes.

- pos11 clear: yes (original state says pos11 is clear, and no steps have placed anything there).

- can move from pos13 to pos12 via dirup: yes.

- can move from pos12 to pos11 via dirup: yes.

- pos11 is a goal: yes.

This plan has 7 steps. But maybe there's a shorter path. Let's see if steps can be optimized.

Alternative approach: After pushing the stone to pos23, maybe the agent can move directly to pos24 and then pos14, but that depends on the path. Alternatively, after step 2, the agent is at pos33. To push the stone from pos23 to pos13, the agent is at pos33. Then after that, the agent is at pos23. Then moves to pos24, pos14. Then push to pos12, then to pos11. That's 7 steps.

Alternatively, is there a way to push the stone from pos13 to pos12 and then to pos11 in fewer steps?

Alternatively, after pushing the stone to pos13 (step 3), the agent is at pos23. From there, move to pos13 (but pos13 is occupied by the stone). No. So the agent must navigate around.

Another way: after step 3 (stone at pos13, agent at pos23), can the agent move to pos14 directly? From pos23, the movement to pos24 (dirright), then pos24 to pos14 (dirup). So steps 4 and 5 are necessary.

Alternatively, after step 3, agent is at pos23. Can the agent move to pos13 via dirup? No, because pos13 has the stone. So cannot.

Thus, the steps are necessary.

Is this the optimal plan? Let's see if there's a shorter path.

Alternative plan:

1. Move from pos42 to pos32 (dirleft).

2. Push stone from pos33 to pos23 (dirdown? Or dirleft? Wait, agent at pos32, stone at pos33. Direction from agent to stone is dirdown (pos32 to pos33 is dirdown). Then push the stone left (dirleft) to pos23. Wait, no: to push the stone, the agent must be adjacent. If the agent is at pos32 (north of pos33), and pushes the stone down to pos34 (dirdown), but that's away from the goal. Not helpful.

Alternatively, from pos32, can the agent push the stone left to pos23? Let's see.

If agent is at pos32, stone is at pos33. The direction from agent to stone is dirdown. Then pushing the stone from pos33 to pos23 (dirleft). For that, the direction from l_p (pos32) to l_from (pos33) is dirdown. Then, the direction from l_from (pos33) to l_to (pos23) is dirleft.

But the movement from pos33 to pos23 via dirleft must be allowed. Yes, according to the movement connections: "You may move from location pos33 to location pos23 following direction dirleft".

So the action would be pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos33 pos23 dirdown (since the direction from pos32 to pos33 is dirdown) and then the direction from pos33 to pos23 is dirleft.

Wait, but the action requires that the direction from l_p to l_from is d, and the direction from l_from to l_to is also d. Wait, no. The action's direction is the same for both movements? Let me check the action's parameters:

The action is "pushtonongoal p s l_p l_from l_to d". The preconditions are:

(iv) you can get from l_p to l_from following direction d.

(v) you can get from l_from to l_to following direction d.

So the same direction d is used for both movements.

Ah, this is crucial. So in the action, the direction d must be the same for moving from l_p to l_from and from l_from to l_to.

Therefore, in the example where the agent is at pos32 and wants to push the stone from pos33 to pos23:

- The direction from l_p (pos32) to l_from (pos33) is dirdown.

- The direction from l_from (pos33) to l_to (pos23) must also be dirdown. But according to movement connections, pos33 to pos23 is dirleft. So this won't work. Therefore, the directions must match.

Therefore, the agent can only push the stone in the same direction as the agent's movement to reach the stone.

So for example, if the agent is at pos43 (east of pos33), direction dirleft, then pushes the stone dirleft (west) to pos23. Both directions are dirleft.

In this case, the direction from agent's position (pos43) to stone's position (pos33) is dirleft, and the direction from stone's position (pos33) to target (pos23) is dirleft. So same direction. So that's valid.

But in the earlier example where the agent is at pos32 (north of pos33), direction dirdown, but pushing the stone west (dirleft), the directions differ. So that's invalid.

Therefore, the direction must be the same for both steps.

This changes the approach. So when pushing, the agent must move in direction d to get from l_p to l_from, and then the stone moves in the same direction d from l_from to l_to.

So in the initial plan, when the agent is at pos43, they push the stone left (dirleft) to pos23. That works because direction is dirleft for both agent to stone and stone to target.

So the initial step 2 is valid.

Now, after step 2, agent is at pos33 (l_from). The stone is at pos23. To push the stone from pos23 to pos13, the agent must be at a position where moving in direction d from l_p to l_from (pos23), and then the stone moves in direction d to l_to (pos13).

So possible directions for pos23:

Looking for a direction d where l_p is adjacent to pos23 via d, and pos23 can move via d to pos13.

For example, direction dirup: pos23 to pos13 is dirup. So the agent needs to be south of pos23 (pos33) and push dirup.

So agent at pos33 (south of pos23), direction dirup. So moving from pos33 to pos23 via dirup (which is allowed). Then, pushing the stone from pos23 to pos13 via dirup.

So action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos23 pos13 dirup.

This is valid because:

- agent is at pos33 (l_p)

- stone is at pos23 (l_from)

- pos13 is clear.

- movement from pos33 to pos23 via dirup is allowed.

- movement from pos23 to pos13 via dirup is allowed.

- pos13 is not a goal.

So yes, this action is valid. That's step 3.

Then, after this, agent is at pos23 (l_from). Now, stone is at pos13. To push from pos13 to pos12 in direction dirup, the agent must be south of pos13 (pos23) and push dirup. Wait, pos13 is row1, column3. South of pos13 is pos23 (row2, column3). So agent at pos23, direction dirup. Then, pushing pos13 to pos12 via dirup.

But can the agent move from pos23 to pos13 via dirup? According to movement connections: "You may move from location pos23 to location pos13 following direction dirup". Yes. So the agent can be at pos23 (after step 3) and perform:

pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos13 pos12 dirup.

Preconditions:

- agent at pos23.

- stone at pos13.

- pos12 clear.

- movement from pos23 to pos13 via dirup.

- movement from pos13 to pos12 via dirup.

- pos12 is not a goal.

Yes. So this action is valid. Then, after this, the agent is at pos13, stone at pos12.

Then, push from pos12 to pos11 via dirup. Agent at pos13, direction dirup. Push from pos12 to pos11:

pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos12 pos11 dirup.

Preconditions:

- agent at pos13.

- stone at pos12.

- pos11 clear.

- movement from pos13 to pos12 via dirup.

- movement from pos12 to pos11 via dirup.

- pos11 is a goal.

Yes.

So this would be steps:

1. move player1 pos42 pos43 dirdown.

2. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos33 pos23 dirleft.

3. move player1 pos33 pos23 dirup. (Wait, after step 2, agent is at pos33. To get to pos23, the agent needs to move dirup. But pos23 has the stone after step 2. Wait no: after step 2, the stone is at pos23. So pos23 is not clear. So agent can't move there. So step 3 can't be moving to pos23. Therefore, the previous plan is incorrect.

Wait, after step 2, the agent is at pos33 (l_from), which was pos33. After the push action, the agent is at pos33 (since l_from is pos33). No, wait the action is pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos33 pos23 dirleft. So l_p is pos43, l_from is pos33. After this action, the agent is moved to l_from (pos33). So after step 2, the agent is at pos33. The stone is at pos23. pos33 is now clear (since the agent is there), but initially pos33 had the stone. Wait, no: when the action is performed, the stone is moved from pos33 to pos23, and the agent moves from pos43 to pos33. So after step 2, the agent is at pos33, stone is at pos23. pos33 is now occupied by the agent, so not clear. pos23 has the stone, so not clear.

Then, step 3: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos23 pos13 dirup.

Preconditions:

- agent is at pos33 (yes).

- stone at pos23 (yes).

- pos13 clear (yes).

- movement from pos33 to pos23 via dirup (yes).

- movement from pos23 to pos13 via dirup (yes).

- pos13 is not a goal.

So this is valid.

After this action, the agent is at pos23 (l_from), stone at pos13.

Then, step 4: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos13 pos12 dirup.

Preconditions:

- agent at pos23 (yes).

- stone at pos13 (yes).

- pos12 clear (yes).

- movement from pos23 to pos13 via dirup (yes).

- movement from pos13 to pos12 via dirup (yes).

- pos12 not a goal.

Yes.

After this, agent is at pos13, stone at pos12.

Step 5: pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos12 pos11 dirup.

This works.

So the steps are:

1. move player1 pos42 pos43 dirdown.

2. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos33 pos23 dirleft.

3. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos23 pos13 dirup.

4. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos13 pos12 dirup.

5. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos12 pos11 dirup.

This is 5 actions. Much shorter than the previous plan. This is possible because after each push, the agent is in a position to perform the next push without needing to move.

Wait, let's verify each step:

Step 1: move to pos43.

Step 2: push stone from pos33 to pos23 dirleft. Agent moves to pos33.

Step 3: push stone from pos23 to pos13 dirup. Agent moves to pos23.

Step 4: push stone from pos13 to pos12 dirup. Agent moves to pos13.

Step 5: push stone from pos12 to pos11 dirup. Agent moves to pos12.

So each push action places the agent in the next position needed for the subsequent push. That's much more efficient. So this plan is optimal with 5 steps.

But wait, after step 3, the agent is at pos23. How can they push the stone from pos13 to pos12? Because the stone is at pos13, the agent needs to be adjacent to pos13 in the direction of the push.

Wait, in step 4, the agent is at pos23, and the stone is at pos13. To push the stone from pos13 to pos12 via dirup, the agent must be at pos23 (south of pos13), and direction is dirup. So movement from pos23 to pos13 via dirup is allowed. Then, the stone is pushed from pos13 to pos12 via dirup. Yes, which is valid.

Then after step 4, the agent is at pos13, which is adjacent to pos12 (south of pos12?), and can push it via dirup to pos11.

This seems correct.

Therefore, the optimal plan is 5 steps.
