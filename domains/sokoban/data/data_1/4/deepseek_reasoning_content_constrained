Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. The goal is to get stone1 to a goal location. From the initial state, stone1 is at pos32, and the only goal location mentioned is pos41. The player starts at pos45.

First, I need to check where the goal locations are. The original state says pos41 is a goal. All others are not. So, the stone needs to be moved to pos41.

Constraints: The player must be at pos35 in some state, and before that, stone1 must have been at pos33. So, the plan must include the player reaching pos35 after stone1 is at pos33.

Let's map out the path. The stone is at pos32 initially. To get it to pos41 (goal), the player needs to push it. But the player is at pos45. Let's see the movement paths.

From pos45, the player can move up to pos44, left to pos35, or right to pos55. But moving left to pos35 might not be possible yet because maybe there's a path. Wait, looking at the "may move" directions:

From pos45, you can move to pos35 (dirleft), pos55 (dirright), or pos44 (dirup). But pos35 is a non-goal location. But the player needs to reach pos35 at some point, but only after stone1 is at pos33.

So, the plan needs to first move the stone from pos32 to pos33, then to pos34, pos35, pos45, etc.? Wait, but pos41 is the goal. How to get the stone to pos41?

Alternatively, the player might need to move the stone from pos32 to pos42 (right), then to pos41 (up). Let's see:

To push the stone from pos32 to pos42 (using pushtonongoal because pos42 isn't a goal), the player needs to be at pos32's adjacent position. Let's see the movement possibilities.

From pos32, the directions allowed are: dirleft (to pos22), dirright (to pos42), dirup (to pos31), dirdown (to pos33). So, if the player is at pos32, they can push the stone to pos42 (right direction). But the player starts at pos45. So the player needs to move from pos45 to pos35 (dirleft), then to pos34 (dirup?), wait, maybe through a different path.

Wait, the movement connections:

Looking at the "may move from" list:

From pos45, directions are dirleft (to pos35), dirright (to pos55), dirup (to pos44).

So, to get to pos32, the player needs to navigate through the grid. Let's think of a path from pos45 to pos32.

Possible path: pos45 -> pos44 (dirup), pos44 -> pos34 (dirleft), pos34 -> pos33 (dirup), pos33 -> pos32 (dirleft). Wait, but can they move that way?

Wait, the "may move from" entries:

Looking for moves involving pos44. From pos44, you can move to pos34 (dirleft), pos54 (dirright), pos43 (dirup), or pos45 (dirdown). So, from pos44, moving dirleft would take the player to pos34.

From pos34, directions: can move to pos24 (dirleft), pos44 (dirright), pos33 (dirup), pos35 (dirdown). Wait, but the player is at pos34. To get to pos33, they can move dirup.

Then, from pos33, directions: can move to pos23 (dirleft), pos43 (dirright), pos32 (dirup?), wait, looking at the "may move from pos33":

"You may move from location pos33 to location pos23 following direction dirleft"
"You may move from location pos33 to location pos43 following direction dirright"
"You may move from location pos33 to location pos32 following direction dirup"
"You may move from location pos33 to location pos34 following direction dirdown"

So, pos33 can go up to pos32. So, if the player is at pos33, they can move dirup to pos32.

So the path from pos45 to pos32 would be:

pos45 -> pos44 (dirup)
pos44 -> pos34 (dirleft)
pos34 -> pos33 (dirup)
pos33 -> pos32 (dirup)

Wait, but moving from pos34 to pos33 is dirup? Let me check again. From pos34, "You may move from location pos34 to location pos24 following direction dirleft", "You may move from location pos34 to location pos44 following direction dirright", "You may move from location pos34 to location pos33 following direction dirup", "You may move from location pos34 to location pos35 following direction dirdown". So yes, from pos34, dirup to pos33.

Then from pos33, dirup to pos32. So that path is possible. Then, once the player is at pos32, they can push the stone to pos42 (dirright), which is a non-goal location. Then, from pos42, the player can push the stone to pos41 (dirleft), which is a goal location. But wait, when pushing, the player has to be adjacent to the stone's current position.

Wait, the action "pushtogoal" requires that the player is at location l_p, which is adjacent to l_from (the stone's current position), following direction d. So, to push the stone from pos42 to pos41 (dirleft), the player must be at pos42's position in the direction opposite of the push. Wait, the direction is the direction from l_p to l_from, and then from l_from to l_to. So for pushing the stone from pos42 to pos41 (left direction), the player would need to be at pos42's right side (pos52?), but wait, no. Let's clarify.

The direction in the push action is the direction from l_p (player's location) to l_from (stone's current position), and then from l_from to l_to. So, for example, if the player is at pos43 and wants to push the stone from pos42 to pos41, the direction would be dirleft (from pos43 to pos42 is left, then from pos42 to pos41 is left). Wait, no. Because the direction d must be the same for both movements. Or maybe the direction applies to both steps. Wait, the preconditions for pushtogoal are:

(iv) you can get from l_p to l_from following direction d

(v) you can get from l_from to l_to following direction d

So direction d must be the same for both. So, for example, if the player is at pos43 and wants to push the stone at pos42 to pos41, the direction would have to be dirleft. Because from pos43 to pos42 is dirleft, and from pos42 to pos41 is dirleft. So that works.

But in our case, after moving the stone from pos32 to pos42 (using pushtonongoal with direction dirright), the player would be at pos32. Then, the stone is at pos42. Now, to push it to pos41 (a goal), we need to use pushtogoal. The player needs to be at a position adjacent to pos42 in the direction that allows pushing left (dirleft). So, the player must be at pos42's right side (pos52?), but according to the movement directions, from pos42 you can go to pos52 via dirright. Wait, looking at the "may move from pos42":

"You may move from location pos42 to location pos32 following direction dirleft"
"You may move from location pos42 to location pos52 following direction dirright"
"You may move from location pos42 to location pos41 following direction dirup"
"You may move from location pos42 to location pos43 following direction dirdown"

Wait, the directions allowed from pos42 are dirleft (to pos32), dirright (to pos52), dirup (to pos41?), no, wait: "You may move from location pos42 to location pos41 following direction dirup"? Wait, pos42 is in row 4, column 2. pos41 is row 4, column 1. So moving left would be from pos42 to pos41, but according to the given moves, moving from pos42 to pos41 is direction dirup. Hmm, maybe the directions are a bit different. Let me check the given "may move" statements.

Looking at the list provided:

"You may move from location pos42 to location pos32 following direction dirleft"
"You may move from location pos42 to location pos52 following direction dirright"
"You may move from location pos42 to location pos41 following direction dirup"
"You may move from location pos42 to location pos43 following direction dirdown"

Wait, so moving from pos42 to pos41 is dirup? That seems odd because pos41 is to the left (same row, column 1 vs column 2). But according to the given data, the direction is dirup. So maybe the grid is such that rows increase vertically and columns horizontally. So pos41 is row4, column1. pos42 is row4, column2. So moving left would be from pos42 to pos41 (column decreases by 1), but according to the given data, the direction for that move is dirup. That's confusing. Maybe the directions are defined differently. For example, dirleft might correspond to moving west (left in columns), dirright to east, dirup to north (rows decrease), dirdown to south (rows increase). Wait, but the positions are named posXY where X is the row and Y is the column. So pos41 is row4, column1; pos42 is row4, column2. So moving left (dirleft) from pos42 would go to pos41 (same row, column1), but according to the given moves, the direction from pos42 to pos41 is dirup. That suggests that the directions might be different. Alternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the movement directions.

Alternatively, perhaps the movement directions are based on a different coordinate system. For example, moving up (dirup) might decrease the row number, and moving down (dirdown) increases it. So pos41 is row4, column1. Moving up from pos42 (row4, column2) would go to pos32 (row3, column2), but according to the given "may move from pos42", dirup takes you to pos41. Hmm, that doesn't add up. Wait, the given move says: "You may move from location pos42 to location pos41 following direction dirup". So pos42 to pos41 is dirup. So dirup here might mean moving left in columns but same row. That's conflicting with standard directions. This is a bit confusing. Let's try to map it out.

Alternatively, perhaps the directions are as follows:

- dirleft: decrease column
- dirright: increase column
- dirup: decrease row
- dirdown: increase row

But according to that, moving from pos42 (row4, column2) dirleft would take to pos41 (column1), but according to the given data, moving from pos42 to pos32 is dirleft. Wait, pos32 is row3, column2. So that would require moving dirup (since row decreases by 1). But according to the given data, moving from pos42 to pos32 is dirleft. That's conflicting.

This confusion is problematic. Let me look at the given "may move" statements again to clarify the directions.

For example, looking at pos31:

"You may move from location pos31 to location pos21 following direction dirleft"
pos31 is row3, column1. pos21 is row2, column1. So moving from pos31 to pos21 would be moving up (row decreases by 1). But the direction here is dirleft. That's odd. So perhaps directions are not aligned with row/column changes. Maybe the directions are based on the grid's edges, not the coordinates.

Alternatively, perhaps the movement directions are based on the grid's adjacency as per the problem's own definitions, which may not follow a standard grid. So we have to rely entirely on the given "may move" statements.

For example, from pos42, moving dirup takes you to pos41. So the player can move from pos42 to pos41 via dirup. Similarly, from pos42, moving dirleft takes you to pos32. So dirleft from pos42 (row4, column2) goes to pos32 (row3, column2), which is up one row. So dirleft here corresponds to moving up, which is not the usual left. This suggests that the directions are perhaps named differently. For example:

- dirleft: up
- dirright: down
- dirup: left
- dirdown: right

But that's just a hypothesis. Alternatively, the directions are named based on the direction you face when moving. For example, moving dirleft from a position might mean turning left from your current facing direction. But given the problem's complexity, it's better to rely strictly on the given "may move" statements.

So, given that, let's proceed.

The stone is at pos32. The player needs to get to a position where they can push it towards pos41.

First, the player needs to reach pos32 to push the stone. But according to the initial state, the player is at pos45. Let's find a path from pos45 to pos32.

Looking at the allowed moves:

pos45 can move to pos35 (dirleft), pos55 (dirright), or pos44 (dirup).

From pos44, the player can move to pos34 (dirleft), pos54 (dirright), pos43 (dirup), or pos45 (dirdown).

From pos34, can move to pos24 (dirleft), pos44 (dirright), pos33 (dirup), or pos35 (dirdown).

From pos33, can move to pos23 (dirleft), pos43 (dirright), pos32 (dirup), or pos34 (dirdown).

So, the path would be:

pos45 -> pos44 (dirup)
pos44 -> pos34 (dirleft)
pos34 -> pos33 (dirup)
pos33 -> pos32 (dirup)

But wait, when moving from pos33 to pos32, the direction is dirup. So according to the preconditions of the move action, the player can move from l_from to l_to following direction d. So that's allowed.

Once the player is at pos32, they can push the stone. But the stone is already at pos32. Wait, initial state says stone1 is at pos32. So if the player is at pos32, that's impossible because a location can't have both the player and the stone. Wait, the initial state says "Location pos32 is clear". Because in the original state, "player1 is at pos45", "stone1 is at pos32", but "Location pos32 is clear" is listed. Wait, that's conflicting. Wait, no: the original state says "Location pos32 is clear" is false? Wait, no. Wait, the original state's list includes "Location pos32 is clear" as a fact. But if the stone is at pos32, then pos32 is not clear. There's a mistake here.

Wait, looking back at the original state:

The original state includes:

"player1 is at location pos45"

"stone1 is at location pos32"

Then, under "Location pos32 is clear". Wait, that's impossible. If the stone is at pos32, then pos32 is not clear. So this must be a mistake. But according to the problem statement, the original state includes "Location pos32 is clear". That's conflicting. Wait, let me check again.

In the original state, the list includes:

"Location pos11 is clear"

...

"Location pos31 is clear"

"Location pos33 is clear"

"Location pos34 is clear"

...

"Location pos32 is clear"

But the stone1 is at pos32. So this is a contradiction. But according to the problem statement, the original state is as given. So perhaps there's an error here. Or maybe "clear" means that there's no agent or stone. Wait, the problem states: "Each position on the grid may contain either the agent, a stone or be empty." So "clear" means empty. Therefore, if a stone is at pos32, pos32 is not clear. But according to the problem statement, the original state lists "Location pos32 is clear" which contradicts the stone being there. This must be a mistake in the problem statement. But since we have to work with the given information, perhaps there's a typo. Wait, looking at the original state again:

Original state:

"player1 is at location pos45"

"stone1 is at location pos32"

"Location pos11 is clear"

...

"Location pos31 is clear"

"Location pos33 is clear"

"Location pos34 is clear"

...

"Location pos32 is clear"

So, according to this, pos32 is clear, which conflicts with the stone being there. This is impossible. Therefore, there's a mistake in the problem statement. But perhaps the "stone1 is at location pos32" is correct, and the "Location pos32 is clear" is a mistake. Or vice versa. This is a problem.

Alternatively, maybe "clear" refers to the agent not being there, and stones are allowed. But the problem statement says "Each position on the grid may contain either the agent, a stone or be empty." So a location is clear if it has neither the agent nor a stone. Therefore, if a stone is present, the location is not clear.

Therefore, the original state has a contradiction. But given that, perhaps the correct initial state is that the stone is at pos32 and pos32 is not clear. But the problem statement lists "Location pos32 is clear" as part of the initial state, which is incorrect. This is a problem, but perhaps it's a typo and the correct initial state is that pos32 is not clear because the stone is there. However, the user provided the problem as such, so we have to proceed with the given information, even if it's contradictory.

Alternatively, maybe "clear" refers to the agent not being present, but stones are allowed. But according to the action preconditions, for example, the move action requires that the destination location is clear, meaning no agent or stone. So in the move action, the player can't move to a location with a stone. So the problem statement's initial state must have pos32 as not clear because the stone is there. Therefore, the original state's mention of "Location pos32 is clear" is incorrect. But since we have to follow the problem as given, perhaps there's a mistake here, but we have to proceed.

Assuming that the stone is at pos32, then pos32 is not clear, which would mean that the initial state's "Location pos32 is clear" is incorrect. But since the problem states that, perhaps the correct initial state is that the stone is at pos32, and pos32 is not clear, but the problem mistakenly says it's clear. This is a major issue. But given that, perhaps we can proceed by assuming that pos32 is not clear, and the stone is there, and the problem statement has a typo. Alternatively, maybe the stone is at pos32 and pos32 is clear, which would be impossible. Therefore, this is a problem.

But given that the problem is presented as such, perhaps we can proceed by assuming that the stone is at pos32, making pos32 not clear, and the initial state's mention of "Location pos32 is clear" is a mistake. Therefore, when planning, the stone is at pos32, which is not clear. So the player can't move into pos32 unless they push the stone.

But the player starts at pos45. So to move the stone from pos32 to pos41, the player must navigate to a position adjacent to pos32 and push it.

But according to the movement rules, the player can only push a stone if they are in a position that allows them to move to the stone's current location in a certain direction. For example, to push the stone from pos32 to pos42 (dirright), the player needs to be at pos32's left side (pos31?), then move right to pos32, then push the stone to pos42.

Wait, the pushtonongoal action requires that the player is at l_p, which is adjacent to l_from (stone's current position), and the direction from l_p to l_from is d, and then from l_from to l_to is also d.

So, for example, if the player is at pos31 (which is adjacent to pos32 via direction dirdown, because moving from pos31 to pos32 is dirdown), then they can push the stone from pos32 (l_from) to pos42 (l_to) via direction dirright? Wait, no. The direction d must be the same for both steps. Let me clarify:

The action "pushtonongoal p s l_p l_from l_to d" requires:

(iv) you can get from l_p to l_from following direction d.

(v) you can get from l_from to l_to following direction d.

So, for example, if the player is at pos31 (l_p), and the stone is at pos32 (l_from), then the direction d would have to be dirdown, because from pos31 to pos32 is dirdown. Then, from pos32, moving dirdown would take to pos42 (since pos32 to pos42 is dirright? Wait, according to the movement data:

From pos32, "You may move from location pos32 to location pos22 following direction dirleft", "You may move from location pos32 to location pos42 following direction dirright", "You may move from location pos32 to location pos31 following direction dirup", "You may move from location pos32 to location pos33 following direction dirdown".

So, to move from pos32 to pos42, direction is dirright. So, if the player is at pos31 (l_p), and wants to push the stone from pos32 (l_from) to pos42 (l_to), the direction d must be the same for both steps. But from l_p (pos31) to l_from (pos32) is dirdown, and from l_from (pos32) to l_to (pos42) is dirright. The directions are different, so this wouldn't work. Therefore, the player must find a direction d that is the same for both movements.

Alternatively, the player could be at pos22 (l_p) and push the stone from pos32 (l_from) to pos42 (l_to) with direction dirright. But from pos22 to pos32 is dirright, and from pos32 to pos42 is dirright. So that works. So direction d would be dirright.

So, if the player is at pos22, they can push the stone from pos32 to pos42 using dirright. But how does the player get to pos22 from pos45?

That's a long path. Let's see:

pos45 -> pos44 (dirup)
pos44 -> pos34 (dirleft)
pos34 -> pos24 (dirleft)
pos24 -> pos14 (dirleft)
pos14 -> pos13 (dirup)
pos13 -> pos12 (dirup)
pos12 -> pos22 (dirright)
Wait, that's a long way. Alternatively:

pos45 -> pos35 (dirleft)
pos35 -> pos34 (dirup)
pos34 -> pos33 (dirup)
pos33 -> pos23 (dirleft)
pos23 -> pos22 (dirup)
Then, from pos22, push the stone from pos32 to pos42 (dirright). But that seems complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the player can take a shorter path. Let me think again.

The stone is at pos32. The player needs to push it to pos42 (non-goal) first, then to pos41 (goal). But the constraint requires that the player is at pos35 in some state, and that before that, the stone was at pos33.

So the plan must involve the player being at pos35 after the stone is at pos33.

So, how to get the stone to pos33? The stone starts at pos32. The player can push it down (dirdown) to pos33.

Wait, from pos32, moving dirdown leads to pos33. So if the player is at pos32's up direction (pos31?), but no. Wait, to push the stone down to pos33, the player needs to be at pos32's up side (pos31?), then push down.

Wait, the direction d for the push action would be dirdown. So the player needs to be at a position l_p such that moving dirdown from l_p reaches pos32 (the stone's current location). Then, moving dirdown from pos32 would reach pos33.

But according to the movement data:

From pos31 to pos32 is dirdown. So if the player is at pos31, they can push the stone from pos32 to pos33 with direction dirdown.

So, the steps would be:

1. Move the player from pos45 to pos31. How?

pos45 -> pos35 (dirleft)
pos35 -> pos34 (dirup)
pos34 -> pos33 (dirup)
pos33 -> pos32 (dirup)
pos32 -> pos31 (dirup) → but pos32 has the stone, which is not clear. Wait, the stone is at pos32, so the player can't move into pos32. Therefore, the player cannot go through pos32. Alternative path.

pos45 -> pos44 (dirup)
pos44 -> pos34 (dirleft)
pos34 -> pos33 (dirup)
pos33 -> pos32 (dirup) → again, blocked by the stone.

Alternatively:

pos45 -> pos35 (dirleft)
pos35 -> pos34 (dirup)
pos34 -> pos24 (dirleft)
pos24 -> pos23 (dirup)
pos23 -> pos22 (dirup)
pos22 -> pos32 (dirright)
But pos32 has the stone, so can't move there.

This is getting complicated. Maybe there's a different approach.

The constraints require that the player is at pos35 at some point, and that before that state, the stone was at pos33. So perhaps the plan must involve moving the stone to pos33 first, then the player goes to pos35.

So, first, move the stone from pos32 to pos33. To do that, the player needs to push it down (dirdown). For that, the player must be at pos32's up direction (pos31), but moving to pos31 requires a path.

Alternatively, the player can push the stone from pos32 to pos33 by being at pos22 and pushing right (dirright), but that's not possible because pos22 to pos32 is dirright, then pos32 to pos33 is dirdown. The direction must be the same for both steps, so that wouldn't work.

Wait, the direction d must be the same for both movements. So, for the push action, the player moves from l_p to l_from in direction d, and the stone moves from l_from to l_to in the same direction d.

So, pushing the stone from pos32 to pos33 would require direction dirdown. Therefore, the player must be at a position that can reach pos32 via dirdown. But looking at the movement data:

From pos31, you can move to pos32 via dirdown. So if the player is at pos31, direction dirdown takes them to pos32. Then, the stone at pos32 would move to pos33 via dirdown. So the action would be:

pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos32 pos33 dirdown

This action is valid if:

(i) player is at pos31

(ii) stone is at pos32

(iii) pos33 is clear

(iv) player can move from pos31 to pos32 (dirdown)

(v) stone can move from pos32 to pos33 (dirdown)

(vi) pos33 is not a goal (since it's pushtonongoal)

pos33 is not a goal, as per initial state. So this action is possible.

So, the player needs to reach pos31. How?

From pos45, the path to pos31:

pos45 -> pos44 (dirup)

pos44 -> pos34 (dirleft)

pos34 -> pos33 (dirup)

pos33 -> pos32 (dirup) → blocked by stone.

Alternative path:

pos45 -> pos35 (dirleft)

pos35 -> pos34 (dirup)

pos34 -> pos33 (dirup)

pos33 -> pos23 (dirleft)

pos23 -> pos22 (dirup)

pos22 -> pos32 (dirright) → blocked.

Alternatively:

pos45 -> pos44 (dirup)

pos44 -> pos34 (dirleft)

pos34 -> pos24 (dirleft)

pos24 -> pos23 (dirup)

pos23 -> pos13 (dirleft)

pos13 -> pos12 (dirup)

pos12 -> pos11 (dirup)

pos11 -> pos21 (dirright)

pos21 -> pos31 (dirright)

That's a long path, but possible.

But that seems too long. Let's see if there's a shorter path.

pos45 -> pos35 (dirleft)

pos35 -> pos34 (dirup)

pos34 -> pos33 (dirup)

pos33 -> pos32 (dirup) → blocked by stone.

Alternatively, pos45 -> pos44 (dirup)

pos44 -> pos43 (dirup)

pos43 -> pos33 (dirleft)

pos33 -> pos32 (dirup) → blocked.

Hmm. The player needs to get to pos31. Let's see:

pos45 -> pos35 (dirleft)

pos35 -> pos34 (dirup)

pos34 -> pos33 (dirup)

pos33 -> pos23 (dirleft)

pos23 -> pos13 (dirleft)

pos13 -> pos12 (dirup)

pos12 -> pos11 (dirup)

pos11 -> pos21 (dirright)

pos21 -> pos31 (dirright)

This path would work. Each move is allowed.

So:

1. move player1 pos45 pos35 dirleft

2. move player1 pos35 pos34 dirup

3. move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup

4. move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft

5. move player1 pos23 pos13 dirleft

6. move player1 pos13 pos12 dirup

7. move player1 pos12 pos11 dirup

8. move player1 pos11 pos21 dirright

9. move player1 pos21 pos31 dirright

Now, the player is at pos31. Then, push the stone from pos32 to pos33:

10. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos32 pos33 dirdown

Now, stone1 is at pos33. Then, the player must reach pos35 at some point. But the constraints require that in some state after this, the player is at pos35, and that before that state, the stone was at pos33. So perhaps after moving the stone to pos33, the player goes to pos35.

But after pushing, the player is at pos32 (since after pushtonongoal, the player moves to l_from (pos32) after pushing. The effects of pushtonongoal are:

(i) agent p is no longer at l_p (pos31)

(ii) stone s is no longer at l_from (pos32)

(iii) l_to (pos33) is no longer clear

(iv) agent p is at l_from (pos32)

(v) stone s is at l_to (pos33)

(vi) l_p (pos31) becomes clear

(vii) stone is at non-goal (pos33 is non-goal)

So after step 10, the player is at pos32.

Now, the stone is at pos33. The player needs to get to pos35. From pos32, possible moves:

pos32 -> pos22 (dirleft), pos42 (dirright), pos31 (dirup), pos33 (dirdown).

But pos33 has the stone. So moving dirdown to pos33 is not possible (since it's not clear). So player can move to pos42 (dirright) or pos22 (dirleft), etc.

But to reach pos35, the player can move from pos32 to pos33 (if it's clear, but it's not), so that's blocked. So alternative path:

After step 10, player is at pos32. Then:

11. move player1 pos32 pos42 dirright

Now at pos42. From there:

12. move player1 pos42 pos43 dirdown

13. move player1 pos43 pos44 dirright

14. move player1 pos44 pos45 dirdown

15. move player1 pos45 pos35 dirleft

But pos35 is clear initially. Wait, after step 10, the player is at pos32. Then moving to pos42 (dirright) is allowed if pos42 is clear. According to initial state, pos42 is clear. After step 10, pos33 is occupied by the stone, but pos42 is still clear.

So after step 11, player is at pos42. Then, pos43 is clear (initial state), so step 12 is possible. Then pos44 is clear, step 13. Then pos45 is clear (initial state), step 14. Then step 15: move from pos45 to pos35 via dirleft. But wait, after step 14, the player is at pos45 again. Then step 15 is possible.

But this path allows the player to reach pos35, satisfying the constraint that player1 is at pos35 in some state, and before that state, stone1 was at pos33 (which was true at step 10).

Now, after moving the stone to pos33, the next goal is to push it to a goal location (pos41). So after step 10, the stone is at pos33. Now, the player is at pos32 (step 10), then moves to pos42 (step 11), etc. But after step 15, the player is at pos35. From there, how to push the stone from pos33 to pos41.

But the stone is at pos33. To push it to pos41, which is a goal location, the player needs to be adjacent to pos33 in a direction that allows pushing towards pos41. Let's see:

pos33 is at row3, column3. pos41 is row4, column1. So the path from pos33 to pos41 would require moving left twice and down once. But the player needs to push the stone step by step.

Alternatively, push the stone from pos33 to pos43 (dirright), then to pos42 (dirleft?), but pos43 is not a goal. Alternatively, push it up to pos23, then left to pos22, etc., but that's not helpful.

Alternatively, the player can push the stone from pos33 to pos34 (dirdown), then to pos44 (dirright), then to pos41 (dirleft). But pos44 is not a goal. Wait, the only goal is pos41.

Alternatively, push the stone from pos33 to pos43 (dirright), then to pos42 (dirdown), then to pos41 (dirleft). pos41 is a goal.

So, let's plan that.

After step 15, the player is at pos35. To push the stone from pos33 to pos43 (dirright), the player needs to be at pos33's left side (pos23?), but direction must be the same for both movements.

Wait, for the pushtogoal action (since pos41 is a goal), the final push to pos41 must use pushtogoal.

So, to push the stone from pos33 to pos43 (dirright), the player must be at pos33's left side (pos23), and direction dirright.

So, action:

pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos33 pos43 dirright

But the player is at pos35. How to get to pos23?

From pos35, possible moves:

pos35 -> pos25 (dirleft), pos45 (dirright), pos34 (dirup).

But this seems complicated. Maybe after step 15, the player is at pos35. Then, they need to move to a position where they can push the stone from pos33 to pos43.

Alternatively, after step 10, the stone is at pos33, and the player is at pos32. Let's see if there's a better path.

After step 10: player is at pos32, stone at pos33.

Then, perhaps:

11. move player1 pos32 pos42 dirright

12. move player1 pos42 pos43 dirdown

13. move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft (but pos33 has the stone, so cannot)

Alternative path:

From pos32, move to pos42 (dirright), then to pos52 (dirright), but that's not helpful.

Alternatively, from pos32, move to pos31 (dirup), then to pos21 (dirleft), etc.

This is getting too complicated. Let's try to re-express the plan.

The key steps needed are:

1. Move the stone from pos32 to pos33, which requires the player to be at pos31 and push down.

2. Ensure the player reaches pos35 after the stone is at pos33.

3. Then move the stone from pos33 to pos41.

But step 3 requires the player to navigate to push the stone towards pos41.

Alternative approach: After moving the stone to pos33, the player can push it to pos34 (dirdown), then to pos44 (dirright), then to pos41 (dirleft). But pos44 is not a goal, so the final push to pos41 must be a pushtogoal action.

So:

After step 10 (stone at pos33, player at pos32):

11. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos33 pos34 dirdown (player moves to pos33, stone to pos34)

12. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos34 pos44 dirright (player moves to pos34, stone to pos44)

13. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos44 pos41 dirleft (player moves to pos44, stone to pos41)

But wait, the directions need to be consistent. Let's check:

For step 11: player is at pos32, pushes stone from pos33 to pos34 with direction dirdown. But to push from pos33 to pos34, the player must be at pos33's up direction (pos23?), and direction dirdown. But the player is at pos32, which is to the left of pos33. So this might not be possible.

Alternatively, step 11: player at pos33 (after moving there) can push the stone to pos34.

But after step 10, the player is at pos32. To get to pos33, they need to move dirdown to pos33, but pos33 has the stone. No, that's blocked.

Hmm. This is quite challenging. Let's try to outline a full plan:

Initial positions:

- player1 at pos45

- stone1 at pos32

Steps:

1. Move player from pos45 to pos35 (dirleft). Now at pos35.

2. Move player from pos35 to pos34 (dirup).

3. Move player from pos34 to pos33 (dirup).

4. Move player from pos33 to pos32 (dirup). But pos32 has the stone, which is blocked. Can't do that.

So this path is invalid.

Alternative path:

1. Move player from pos45 to pos44 (dirup).

2. Move player from pos44 to pos34 (dirleft).

3. Move player from pos34 to pos24 (dirleft).

4. Move player from pos24 to pos23 (dirup).

5. Move player from pos23 to pos13 (dirleft).

6. Move player from pos13 to pos12 (dirup).

7. Move player from pos12 to pos11 (dirup).

8. Move player from pos11 to pos21 (dirright).

9. Move player from pos21 to pos31 (dirright).

Now at pos31. Now, push the stone from pos32 to pos33 (dirdown):

10. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos32 pos33 dirdown

Now, stone at pos33, player at pos32.

Now, need to get to pos35. From pos32:

11. Move player from pos32 to pos42 (dirright).

12. Move player from pos42 to pos43 (dirdown).

13. Move player from pos43 to pos44 (dirdown).

14. Move player from pos44 to pos45 (dirdown).

15. Move player from pos45 to pos35 (dirleft).

Now, player is at pos35. This satisfies the constraint: player is at pos35 in this state, and previously, the stone was at pos33 (at step 10).

Now, need to push the stone from pos33 to pos41. So from pos35, how to reach a position to push the stone.

Stone is at pos33. The player needs to be in a position adjacent to pos33 such that they can push it towards pos41.

To push from pos33 to pos43 (dirright), then to pos42 (dirdown), then to pos41 (dirleft).

But for each push, the player must be in the correct position.

First, push from pos33 to pos43 (dirright):

Player needs to be at pos33's left (pos23) and push right.

So:

16. Move player from pos35 to pos34 (dirup).

17. Move player from pos34 to pos33 (dirup). But pos33 has the stone. Blocked.

Alternative path:

From pos35, move to pos25 (dirleft), then to pos24 (dirup), then to pos23 (dirleft), then to pos13 (dirleft), etc. Too long.

Alternatively, from pos35:

16. Move player from pos35 to pos34 (dirup).

17. Move player from pos34 to pos24 (dirleft).

18. Move player from pos24 to pos23 (dirup).

19. Move player from pos23 to pos13 (dirleft).

20. Move player from pos13 to pos12 (dirup).

21. Move player from pos12 to pos22 (dirright).

22. Move player from pos22 to pos23 (dirup).

23. Now at pos23. Push stone from pos33 to pos43 (dirright):

23. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos33 pos43 dirright

Now, stone at pos43, player at pos33.

Next, push from pos43 to pos42 (dirdown):

Player needs to be at pos43's up direction (pos33), which they are already at.

24. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos43 pos42 dirdown

Now, stone at pos42, player at pos43.

Finally, push from pos42 to pos41 (dirup):

25. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos42 pos41 dirup

Because pos41 is a goal location.

But let's verify the directions:

For step 25: player is at pos43 (l_p). The stone is at pos42 (l_from). The direction must be dirup, as per the action's direction d.

From pos43 to pos42 is dirup (according to movement data: "You may move from location pos43 to location pos42 following direction dirup").

From pos42 to pos41 is dirup (given in the movement data: "You may move from location pos42 to location pos41 following direction dirup").

So direction d is dirup. Thus, the action is valid.

After this, the stone is at pos41, which is a goal location. The task is accomplished.

So the full plan includes steps 1-25, but we need to check if it's optimal. However, this seems very long. Maybe there's a shorter path.

Let me try to find a shorter sequence:

After step 15, player is at pos35. Now, stone is at pos33. To push it to pos41:

From pos35, the player can move to pos34 (dirup), then to pos33 (dirup). But pos33 has the stone. Can't move there. So alternative path.

Player is at pos35. Move to pos34 (dirup), then to pos34's left (pos24). Then up to pos23, left to pos13, etc., to get to pos23, then push the stone to pos43. Then from there, push down to pos42, then up to pos41.

But this seems long. Alternatively, after step 10 (stone at pos33, player at pos32), can the player push the stone to pos34, then to pos44, then to pos41?

Let's see:

After step 10: player at pos32, stone at pos33.

11. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos33 pos34 dirdown

But for this action, direction d must be dirdown. So from l_p (player's location) to l_from (pos33) must be dirdown. The player is at pos32. Can they move dirdown to pos33? According to movement data, from pos32, you can move dirdown to pos33. So yes. So the action is:

pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos33 pos34 dirdown

This is valid. After this, stone is at pos34, player at pos33.

12. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos34 pos44 dirdown

Direction dirdown: from pos33 to pos34 is dirdown, and from pos34 to pos44 is dirdown. Wait, no. From pos34, dirdown is to pos44? Let's check movement data:

From pos34: "You may move from location pos34 to location pos24 following direction dirleft", "You may move from location pos34 to location pos44 following direction dirright", "You may move from location pos34 to location pos33 following direction dirup", "You may move from location pos34 to location pos35 following direction dirdown".

So dirdown from pos34 is to pos35. To get to pos44 from pos34, it's dirright.

So to push from pos34 to pos44, the direction would have to be dirright. So the player needs to be at pos34's left (pos24) to push right.

But the player is at pos33. So after step 11, the player is at pos33. To push the stone from pos34 to pos44, the player needs to be at pos34's left (pos24), but that's not accessible from pos33.

This approach might not work.

Alternatively, after step 11 (stone at pos34, player at pos33), the player can move to pos34 (dirup), but pos34 is occupied by the stone. No.

This is getting too convoluted. Perhaps the initial plan with 25 steps is the only way, but it's not optimal. The user requires an optimal plan with the least steps.

Alternative idea: After moving the stone to pos33 (step 10), the player can move to pos35 directly via:

10. After pushing, player is at pos32.

11. move player1 pos32 pos42 dirright

12. move player1 pos42 pos43 dirdown

13. move player1 pos43 pos44 dirdown

14. move player1 pos44 pos45 dirdown

15. move player1 pos45 pos35 dirleft

Now, player at pos35 (step 15), stone at pos33.

Now, to push the stone from pos33 to pos43 (dirright), the player needs to be at pos33's left (pos23), push dirright.

So:

16. move player1 pos35 pos34 dirup

17. move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft

18. move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup

19. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos33 pos43 dirright

Now, stone at pos43, player at pos33.

20. move player1 pos33 pos43 dirright

21. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos43 pos41 dirup → No, because the stone is at pos43. The player needs to push from pos43 to pos41.

Wait, from pos43, pushing the stone to pos42 (dirdown), then to pos41 (dirleft).

But pos43 to pos42 is dirdown, and pos42 to pos41 is dirup. But the directions must be the same. So to push from pos43 to pos42 (dirdown), player must be at pos43's up (pos33) and push dirdown. So:

After step 19, stone is at pos43, player at pos33.

20. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos43 pos42 dirdown

Now, stone at pos42, player at pos43.

21. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos42 pos41 dirup

Yes, because from pos43 to pos42 is dirup (movement data: from pos43 to pos42 is dirup), and from pos42 to pos41 is dirup (movement data: from pos42 to pos41 is dirup). So direction dirup is the same.

Thus, this action is valid. After this, stone is at pos41 (goal).

So the total steps are:

1. move player1 pos45 pos44 dirup

2. move player1 pos44 pos34 dirleft

3. move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup

4. move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft

5. move player1 pos23 pos13 dirleft

6. move player1 pos13 pos12 dirup

7. move player1 pos12 pos11 dirup

8. move player1 pos11 pos21 dirright

9. move player1 pos21 pos31 dirright

10. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos32 pos33 dirdown

11. move player1 pos32 pos42 dirright

12. move player1 pos42 pos43 dirdown

13. move player1 pos43 pos44 dirdown

14. move player1 pos44 pos45 dirdown

15. move player1 pos45 pos35 dirleft

16. move player1 pos35 pos34 dirup

17. move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft

18. move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup

19. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos33 pos43 dirright

20. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos43 pos42 dirdown

21. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos42 pos41 dirup

But this plan has 21 steps, which is quite long. However, given the constraints, this might be necessary.

But perhaps there's a shorter path. Let's think again.

Alternative plan:

1. Move player from pos45 to pos35 (dirleft).

2. Move player from pos35 to pos34 (dirup).

3. Move player from pos34 to pos33 (dirup).

4. Move player from pos33 to pos23 (dirleft).

5. Move player from pos23 to pos13 (dirleft).

6. Move player from pos13 to pos12 (dirup).

7. Move player from pos12 to pos11 (dirup).

8. Move player from pos11 to pos21 (dirright).

9. Move player from pos21 to pos31 (dirright).

10. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos32 pos33 dirdown.

Now, player at pos32.

11. move player1 pos32 pos42 dirright.

12. move player1 pos42 pos43 dirdown.

13. move player1 pos43 pos44 dirdown.

14. move player1 pos44 pos45 dirdown.

15. move player1 pos45 pos35 dirleft.

At this point, the player is at pos35, meeting the constraint. Then:

16. move player1 pos35 pos34 dirup.

17. move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft.

18. move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup.

19. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos33 pos43 dirright.

20. move player1 pos43 pos42 dirup.

21. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos42 pos41 dirup. → No, the stone is at pos43 after step 19. So step 19 leaves stone at pos43, player at pos33.

Wait, after step 19, the stone is at pos43, player is at pos33.

Then:

20. move player1 pos33 pos43 dirright.

21. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos43 pos42 dirdown.

But pos43 to pos42 is dirdown. Then from pos42 to pos41 is dirup. So:

21. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos43 pos42 dirdown.

22. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos42 pos41 dirup.

But this might work.

This is getting too long. I think the optimal plan is likely shorter, but given the complexity, I'll proceed with the initial steps and see.
