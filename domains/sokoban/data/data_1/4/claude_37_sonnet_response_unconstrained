Alright, so in this sokoban-like problem:

1. We have a 5x5 grid.
2. The agent (player1) starts at pos45.
3. There's a stone (stone1) at pos32.
4. The goal is to move the stone to a goal location.
5. There's only one goal location, which is pos41.

Let's visualize the grid with the agent (A), stone (S), and goal (G):

```
  1 2 3 4 5
1 . . . . .
2 . . . . .
3 . S . . .
4 G . . . A
5 . . . . .
```

Now, let's think about how to solve this:

The agent needs to push the stone to the goal at pos41. But to push, the agent needs to be behind the stone in the direction opposite to the push. 

From pos45, the agent needs to reach pos33 to push the stone (at pos32) down to pos42.
Then, the agent needs to push the stone from pos42 to pos41.

Let's trace a path for the agent to first go from pos45 to pos33:

1. Start at pos45
2. Move to pos44 (up)
3. Move to pos43 (up)
4. Move to pos33 (left)

Now, the agent is at pos33 and the stone is at pos32. To push the stone down to pos42, the agent needs to move to pos22 (to be behind the stone in the up direction).

5. Move to pos23 (left)
6. Move to pos13 (left)
7. Move to pos12 (up)
8. Move to pos22 (right)

Now, the agent is at pos22 and the stone is at pos32. The agent can push the stone down to pos42.

9. Push stone from pos32 to pos42 (down)

After this, the agent is at pos32 and the stone is at pos42. To push the stone left to pos41, the agent needs to be at pos43.

10. Move to pos33 (down)
11. Move to pos43 (right)

Now, the agent is at pos43 and the stone is at pos42. The agent can push the stone left to pos41.

12. Push stone from pos42 to pos41 (left)

This should get the stone to the goal location at pos41.

Now, I'll formalize this into actual action steps:

1. move player1 pos45 pos44 dirup
2. move player1 pos44 pos43 dirup
3. move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft
4. move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft
5. move player1 pos23 pos13 dirleft
6. move player1 pos13 pos12 dirup
7. move player1 pos12 pos22 dirright
8. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos32 pos42 dirdown
9. move player1 pos32 pos33 dirdown
10. move player1 pos33 pos43 dirright
11. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos42 pos41 dirleft

But wait, I need to check the push actions more carefully. The actions are:

- "pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": The agent p at l_p pushes stone s from l_from to l_to in direction d. l_to is a goal location.
- "pushtonongoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": Similar, but l_to is not a goal location.

So for step 8, the agent is at pos22, the stone is at pos32, and we're pushing it to pos42 in the down direction. pos42 is not a goal location, so this is "pushtonongoal".

For step 11, the agent is at pos43, the stone is at pos42, and we're pushing it to pos41 in the left direction. pos41 is a goal location, so this is "pushtogoal".

The plan should be correct, but let me verify the adjacencies:

move player1 pos45 pos44 dirup: Valid as pos45 and pos44 are adjacent (pos45 is to the down of pos44).
move player1 pos44 pos43 dirup: Valid as pos44 and pos43 are adjacent (pos44 is to the down of pos43).
move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft: Valid as pos43 and pos33 are adjacent (pos43 is to the right of pos33).
move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft: Valid as pos33 and pos23 are adjacent (pos33 is to the right of pos23).
move player1 pos23 pos13 dirleft: Valid as pos23 and pos13 are adjacent (pos23 is to the right of pos13).
move player1 pos13 pos12 dirup: Valid as pos13 and pos12 are adjacent (pos13 is to the down of pos12).
move player1 pos12 pos22 dirright: Valid as pos12 and pos22 are adjacent (pos12 is to the left of pos22).
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos32 pos42 dirdown: Valid as pos22 is behind pos32 in the up direction, and pos42 is in front of pos32 in the down direction.
move player1 pos32 pos33 dirdown: Valid as pos32 and pos33 are adjacent (pos32 is to the up of pos33).
move player1 pos33 pos43 dirright: Valid as pos33 and pos43 are adjacent (pos33 is to the left of pos43).
pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos42 pos41 dirleft: Valid as pos43 is behind pos42 in the right direction, and pos41 is in front of pos42 in the left direction.

Hmm, I'm not 100% sure about the dirdown, dirup, dirleft, dirright directions. Let me think about this again.

From the initial state, I noticed these lines:
"You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright"
"You may move from location pos11 to location pos12 following direction dirdown"

This suggests that dirright increases the first digit, and dirdown increases the second digit.

So the grid is like:
```
  1 2 3 4 5 (y axis)
1 . . . . .
2 . . . . .
3 . S . . .
4 G . . . .
5 . . . . A
```

With this interpretation, let's adjust the plan:

1. move player1 pos45 pos44 dirup
2. move player1 pos44 pos43 dirup
3. move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft
4. move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft
5. move player1 pos23 pos13 dirleft
6. move player1 pos13 pos12 dirup
7. move player1 pos12 pos22 dirright
8. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos32 pos42 dirright
9. move player1 pos32 pos33 dirdown
10. move player1 pos33 pos43 dirright
11. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos42 pos41 dirleft

Hm, wait. I think I might be mixing up the coordinates.

Let's go back to the problem: "You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright". This indicates that moving from pos11 to pos21 is a right direction. But from my grid, if the first digit is the x-axis (horizontal) and the second digit is the y-axis (vertical), then pos11 to pos21 would be a downward movement.

Let me re-interpret:

If the first digit is the y-axis (vertical) and the second digit is the x-axis (horizontal), then:
- pos11 to pos21 is a downward movement along the y-axis (dirright).
- pos11 to pos12 is a rightward movement along the x-axis (dirdown).

But this is also counterintuitive, and doesn't match the names of the directions.

Wait, let's try yet another interpretation. Maybe it's just reflecting the original representation, so moving down the first digit (e.g., pos11 to pos21) is moving to the right on the grid. if we represent the grid like:
```
    1 2 3 4 5 (first digit, y-axis)
  +----------
1 | . . . . .
2 | . . . . .
3 | . S . . .
4 | G . . . .
5 | . . . . A
  (second digit, x-axis)
```

So:
- pos11 to pos21 is moving one down on the grid, but the second digit indicates the x-coordinate. This movement is considered rightward.
- pos11 to pos12 is moving one right on the grid, represented by the increasing y-coordinate. This movement is considered downward.

Hmm, this is confusing and doesn't match up well with the direction names. Let's just go back to the adjacency information provided in the problem and rely on that.

Actually, let's try once more, but with a direct interpretation of the adjacency information. I'll draw the grid again based on the listed adjacent positions:

Pos11 is adjacent to:
- Pos21 (dirright)
- Pos12 (dirdown)

Pos12 is adjacent to:
- Pos22 (dirright)
- Pos11 (dirup)
- Pos13 (dirdown)

And so on.

This suggests a grid like:
```
   1  2  3  4  5
 +--------------
1| 11 12 13 14 15
2| 21 22 23 24 25
3| 31 32 33 34 35
4| 41 42 43 44 45
5| 51 52 53 54 55
```

In this grid:
- dirright moves from the first column to the second (increases the second digit).
- dirdown moves from the first row to the second (increases the first digit).
- dirleft moves from the second column to the first (decreases the second digit).
- dirup moves from the second row to the first (decreases the first digit).

With this interpretation, let's re-visualize the grid with the agent (A), stone (S), and goal (G):

```
   1  2  3  4  5
 +--------------
1| .  .  .  .  .
2| .  .  .  .  .
3| .  S  .  .  .
4| G  .  .  .  A
5| .  .  .  .  .
```

This seems right, and matches the adjacency information.

Now, let's re-plan the solution:

1. Move from pos45 to pos44 (dirup)
2. Move from pos44 to pos43 (dirup)
3. Move from pos43 to pos33 (dirleft)
4. Move from pos33 to pos23 (dirleft)
5. Move from pos23 to pos13 (dirleft)
6. Move from pos13 to pos12 (dirup)
7. Move from pos12 to pos22 (dirdown)
8. Push from pos22 to pos32 to pos42 (dirdown)
9. Move from pos32 to pos33 (dirright)
10. Move from pos33 to pos43 (dirdown)
11. Push from pos43 to pos42 to pos41 (dirleft)

In formal actions:

1. move player1 pos45 pos44 dirup
2. move player1 pos44 pos43 dirup
3. move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft
4. move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft
5. move player1 pos23 pos13 dirleft
6. move player1 pos13 pos12 dirup
7. move player1 pos12 pos22 dirdown
8. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos32 pos42 dirdown
9. move player1 pos32 pos33 dirright
10. move player1 pos33 pos43 dirdown
11. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos42 pos41 dirleft

Actually, there's a critical issue with the 8th step (pushing the stone from pos32 to pos42). The precondition for pushing a stone is that the agent is at a location adjacent to the stone, in the opposite direction of the push. But after the 7th step, the agent is at pos22, which is not directly adjacent to pos32 in the "down" direction. Rather, it's adjacent in the "right" direction.

So, the agent needs to get behind the stone in the up direction to push it down. Let's correct this:

7. move player1 pos12 pos22 dirdown
8. move player1 pos22 pos32 dirdown (this is wrong, since pos32 is not clear; it has the stone)

We need to approach the stone from another direction. Let's restart the planning:

The goal is to push the stone from pos32 to pos41 (which is a goal location). From their positions, the agent (at pos45) needs to first reach the stone (at pos32).

To push the stone to the goal, the agent could push it left, from pos32 -> pos31 -> pos41. Alternatively, the agent could push the stone down, and then left, from pos32 -> pos42 -> pos41.

Let's go with the first approach:
1. Move from pos45 to pos35 (dirleft)
2. Move from pos35 to pos34 (dirup)
3. Move from pos34 to pos33 (dirup)
4. Move from pos33 to pos32 (dirleft)
5. Move from pos32 to pos31 (dirleft)

But this doesn't make sense because the agent can't be at the same position as the stone. Let's revisit our approach.

To push the stone left, the agent needs to be at pos33. Then, the agent would be behind the stone in the "right" direction, and can push it left.

Let's plan again:
1. Move from pos45 to pos35 (dirleft)
2. Move from pos35 to pos34 (dirup)
3. Move from pos34 to pos33 (dirup)
4. Push stone from pos33 to pos32 to pos31 (dirleft)
5. Move from pos32 to pos33 (dirright)
6. Move from pos33 to pos34 (dirright)
7. Move from pos34 to pos44 (dirdown)
8. Move from pos44 to pos43 (dirup)
9. Move from pos43 to pos42 (dirleft)
10. Move from pos42 to pos41 (dirleft)
11. Move from pos41 to pos31 (dirup)
12. Push stone from pos31 to pos41 (dirdown)

This is getting convoluted. Let's simplify.

1. The agent is at pos45.
2. The stone is at pos32.
3. We want to get the stone to pos41 (a goal location).

We can push the stone from:
- pos32 to pos31 to pos41 (push left, then down)
- pos32 to pos42 to pos41 (push down, then left)

Let's try the second approach:
1. Agent needs to get to pos22 (to push the stone down from pos32 to pos42).
2. Agent needs to get to pos43 (to push the stone left from pos42 to pos41).

So, the plan would be:
1. Move from pos45 to pos44 (dirup)
2. Move from pos44 to pos34 (dirleft)
3. Move from pos34 to pos24 (dirleft)
4. Move from pos24 to pos23 (dirup)
5. Move from pos23 to pos22 (dirup)
6. Push stone from pos22 to pos32 to pos42 (dirdown)
7. Move from pos32 to pos33 (dirright)
8. Move from pos33 to pos43 (dirdown)
9. Push stone from pos43 to pos42 to pos41 (dirleft)

This looks correct. Let me verify the action format:

1. move player1 pos45 pos44 dirup
2. move player1 pos44 pos34 dirleft
3. move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft
4. move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup
5. move player1 pos23 pos22 dirup
6. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos32 pos42 dirdown
7. move player1 pos32 pos33 dirright
8. move player1 pos33 pos43 dirdown
9. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos42 pos41 dirleft

Wait, I think there's still a confusion with the push actions. Let's revisit them:

"pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": You may only perform this action if (i) agent p is at location l_p, (ii) stone s is at location l_from, (iii) location l_to is clear, (iv) you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d, (v) you can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d, and (vi) location l_to is a goal location.

For step 6, the agent is at pos22, the stone is at pos32, and we're pushing it to pos42 (which is not a goal). To get from pos22 to pos32, we go in dirdown. And to get from pos32 to pos42, we also go in dirdown. So, the action is:
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos32 pos42 dirdown

For step 9, the agent is at pos43, the stone is at pos42, and we're pushing it to pos41 (which is a goal). To get from pos43 to pos42, we go in dirleft. And to get from pos42 to pos41, we also go in dirleft. So, the action is:
pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos42 pos41 dirleft

So, the push actions seem correct based on my understanding.

Let's now revise our plan:

1. move player1 pos45 pos44 dirup
2. move player1 pos44 pos34 dirleft
3. move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft
4. move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup
5. move player1 pos23 pos22 dirup
6. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos32 pos42 dirdown
7. move player1 pos32 pos33 dirright
8. move player1 pos33 pos43 dirdown
9. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos42 pos41 dirleft

I think this is correct. Let's double-check the path and the directions:

1. Agent moves from pos45 to pos44 (up).
2. Agent moves from pos44 to pos34 (left).
3. Agent moves from pos34 to pos24 (left).
4. Agent moves from pos24 to pos23 (up).
5. Agent moves from pos23 to pos22 (up).
6. Agent pushes the stone from pos32 to pos42 (down).
7. Agent moves from pos32 to pos33 (right).
8. Agent moves from pos33 to pos43 (down).
9. Agent pushes the stone from pos42 to pos41 (left).

This looks good! The agent follows a clear path, and the push actions align with the directions and my understanding of the action.

So, the final plan is:
1. move player1 pos45 pos44 dirup
2. move player1 pos44 pos34 dirleft
3. move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft
4. move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup
5. move player1 pos23 pos22 dirup
6. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos32 pos42 dirdown
7. move player1 pos32 pos33 dirright
8. move player1 pos33 pos43 dirdown
9. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos42 pos41 dirleft

Actually, on second thought, let's just double check whether we need the direction arguments in the move and push actions to be the "from -> to" directions.

Let's look at the move action:
"move p l_from l_to d" has the precondition "you can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d." This suggests that d is the direction from l_from to l_to.

For the push actions, the direction d appears in two preconditions:
(iv) "you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d"
(v) "you can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d"

For example, in step 6:
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos32 pos42 dirdown

This means the agent at pos22 is pushing the stone from pos32 to pos42. And the direction for both "pos22 to pos32" and "pos32 to pos42" is "dirdown". This means that dirdown corresponds to increasing the first digit of the position, which aligns with our understanding.

So, the direction arguments in the plan look correct.

Let's finalize the plan:
1. move player1 pos45 pos44 dirup
2. move player1 pos44 pos34 dirleft
3. move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft
4. move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup
5. move player1 pos23 pos22 dirup
6. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos32 pos42 dirdown
7. move player1 pos32 pos33 dirright
8. move player1 pos33 pos43 dirdown
9. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos42 pos41 dirleft

I'm pretty confident in this solution.
