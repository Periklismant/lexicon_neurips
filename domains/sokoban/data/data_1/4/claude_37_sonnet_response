Let me understand the problem:

1. We have a 5x5 grid (positions pos11, pos12, ..., pos55).
2. The agent player1 starts at pos45.
3. There's a stone (stone1) at pos32.
4. The goal location is pos41.
5. The task is to move stone1 to a goal location (which is only pos41 in this case).
6. There are two constraints:
   a. player1 must be at pos35 at some point in the plan.
   b. If player1 is at pos35, then stone1 must have been at pos33 at some earlier point.

To solve this problem, I need to plan a sequence of actions that moves stone1 to pos41 while ensuring that the constraints are met.

Let's think through a plan:

Starting position:
- player1 is at pos45.
- stone1 is at pos32.
- goal is at pos41.

I need to move player1 to push stone1 to pos41, and along the way, ensure that stone1 goes through pos33 and player1 passes through pos35.

Let's trace a plan:

1. First, player1 needs to get to a position from which they can push stone1.
   - player1 is at pos45, and stone1 is at pos32.
   - player1 can move to pos35, then pos34, then pos33, and then pos23 to push stone1 from pos32.

2. I need to make sure stone1 goes through pos33, so the natural path would be to push stone1 from pos32 to pos33.

3. I also need player1 to be at pos35 at some point, which can be after pushing stone1 to pos41.

4. The path from pos32 to pos41 could be: pos32 -> pos33 -> pos43 -> pos42 -> pos41.

Let's work out the detailed plan:

1. player1 moves from pos45 to pos35 (move player1 pos45 pos35 dirleft).
2. player1 moves from pos35 to pos34 (move player1 pos35 pos34 dirup).
3. player1 moves from pos34 to pos33 (move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup).
4. player1 moves from pos33 to pos23 (move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft).
5. player1 pushes stone1 from pos32 to pos33 (pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos32 pos33 dirdown).
   - Now stone1 is at pos33.
6. player1 moves from pos32 to pos33 (move player1 pos32 pos33 dirdown).
7. player1 moves from pos33 to pos43 (move player1 pos33 pos43 dirright).
8. player1 pushes stone1 from pos33 to pos43 (pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos33 pos43 dirleft).
   - Now stone1 is at pos43.
9. player1 moves from pos33 to pos34 (move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown).
10. player1 moves from pos34 to pos35 (move player1 pos34 pos35 dirdown).
    - Now player1 is at pos35, which satisfies the first constraint.
11. player1 moves from pos35 to pos45 (move player1 pos35 pos45 dirright).
12. player1 moves from pos45 to pos44 (move player1 pos45 pos44 dirup).
13. player1 moves from pos44 to pos43 (move player1 pos44 pos43 dirup).
14. player1 moves from pos43 to pos42 (move player1 pos43 pos42 dirup).
15. player1 pushes stone1 from pos43 to pos42 (pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos43 pos42 dirleft).
    - Now stone1 is at pos42.
16. player1 moves from pos43 to pos42 (move player1 pos43 pos42 dirup).
17. player1 moves from pos42 to pos41 (move player1 pos42 pos41 dirup).
18. player1 pushes stone1 from pos42 to pos41 (pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos41 pos42 pos41 dirleft).
    - Now stone1 is at pos41 (a goal location).

Wait, there's a problem with this plan. Let me trace through the state changes to make sure it works:

1. Initial state:
   - player1 is at pos45.
   - stone1 is at pos32.

2. move player1 pos45 pos35 dirleft:
   - player1 is at pos35.
   - stone1 is at pos32.

3. move player1 pos35 pos34 dirup:
   - player1 is at pos34.
   - stone1 is at pos32.

4. move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup:
   - player1 is at pos33.
   - stone1 is at pos32.

5. move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft:
   - player1 is at pos23.
   - stone1 is at pos32.

6. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos32 pos33 dirdown:
   - player1 is at pos32.
   - stone1 is at pos33.

This part is fine. Stone1 is at pos33, so the second constraint is satisfied.

7. move player1 pos32 pos33 dirdown:
   Wait, this is not valid. pos33 is not clear because stone1 is there.

Let me rethink this. I need to push stone1 from pos33 to pos43 and I need player1 to be at pos35.

Let's try again:

1. move player1 pos45 pos35 dirleft.
2. move player1 pos35 pos34 dirup.
3. move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup.
4. move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft.
5. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos32 pos33 dirdown.
   - Now player1 is at pos32 and stone1 is at pos33.
6. move player1 pos32 pos31 dirup.
7. move player1 pos31 pos41 dirright.
8. move player1 pos41 pos42 dirdown.
9. move player1 pos42 pos43 dirdown.
10. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos33 pos43 dirleft.
    - Now player1 is at pos33 and stone1 is at pos43.
11. move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown.
12. move player1 pos34 pos35 dirdown.
    - Now player1 is at pos35, which satisfies the first constraint.
13. move player1 pos35 pos34 dirup.
14. move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup.
15. move player1 pos33 pos43 dirright.
16. move player1 pos43 pos42 dirup.
17. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos43 pos42 dirleft.
    - Now player1 is at pos43 and stone1 is at pos42.
18. move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft.
19. move player1 pos33 pos32 dirup.
20. move player1 pos32 pos42 dirright.
21. move player1 pos42 pos41 dirup.
22. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos41 pos42 pos41 dirleft.
    - Now player1 is at pos42 and stone1 is at pos41 (a goal location).

Let me check again. Wait, in step 10, I'm pushing stone1 from pos33 to pos43 when player1 is at pos43. This doesn't make sense. Let me retrace the steps:

1. Initial state:
   - player1 is at pos45.
   - stone1 is at pos32.

2. move player1 pos45 pos35 dirleft:
   - player1 is at pos35.
   - stone1 is at pos32.

3. move player1 pos35 pos34 dirup:
   - player1 is at pos34.
   - stone1 is at pos32.

4. move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup:
   - player1 is at pos33.
   - stone1 is at pos32.

5. move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft:
   - player1 is at pos23.
   - stone1 is at pos32.

6. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos32 pos33 dirdown:
   - player1 is at pos32.
   - stone1 is at pos33.

7. move player1 pos32 pos42 dirright:
   - player1 is at pos42.
   - stone1 is at pos33.

8. move player1 pos42 pos43 dirdown:
   - player1 is at pos43.
   - stone1 is at pos33.

9. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos33 pos43 dirleft:
   - player1 is at pos33.
   - stone1 is at pos43.

10. move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown:
    - player1 is at pos34.
    - stone1 is at pos43.

11. move player1 pos34 pos35 dirdown:
    - player1 is at pos35.
    - stone1 is at pos43.

12. move player1 pos35 pos45 dirright:
    - player1 is at pos45.
    - stone1 is at pos43.

13. move player1 pos45 pos44 dirup:
    - player1 is at pos44.
    - stone1 is at pos43.

14. move player1 pos44 pos43 dirup:
    - player1 is at pos43.
    - stone1 is at pos43.

That's not right. I'm trying to be at pos43 where the stone is. Let me rethink this:

Actually, the pushtogoal and pushtonongoal actions describe the agent pushing a stone from a location, not the agent moving to where the stone is. Let me revisit the action descriptions:

For "pushtonongoal p s l_p l_from l_to d", the agent p is at location l_p, and the stone s is at location l_from. The agent pushes the stone from l_from to l_to.

Let me trace the steps again, being careful about the action preconditions and effects:

1. Initial state:
   - player1 is at pos45.
   - stone1 is at pos32.

I need to move player1 to a position from which they can push stone1 to pos33. The agent needs to be in a position adjacent to the stone in the opposite direction of the desired push. To push stone1 from pos32 to pos33 (which is downward), player1 needs to be at pos31.

1. move player1 pos45 pos44 dirup.
2. move player1 pos44 pos43 dirup.
3. move player1 pos43 pos42 dirup.
4. move player1 pos42 pos41 dirup.
5. move player1 pos41 pos31 dirleft.
6. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos32 pos33 dirdown.
   - Now player1 is at pos32, stone1 is at pos33.

We've already satisfied one of the constraints: stone1 is at pos33. Now we need to ensure that player1 is at pos35 at some point.

7. move player1 pos32 pos42 dirright.
8. move player1 pos42 pos43 dirdown.
9. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos33 pos43 dirleft.
   - Now player1 is at pos33, stone1 is at pos43.

10. move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown.
11. move player1 pos34 pos35 dirdown.
    - Now player1 is at pos35, which satisfies the other constraint.

Now, we need to push stone1 from pos43 to pos41 (the goal). To push stone1 from pos43 to pos42 (which is upward), player1 needs to be at pos44.

12. move player1 pos35 pos45 dirright.
13. move player1 pos45 pos44 dirup.
14. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos43 pos42 dirup.
    - Now player1 is at pos43, stone1 is at pos42.

Finally, to push stone1 from pos42 to pos41 (which is upward), player1 needs to be at pos43.

15. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos42 pos41 dirup.
    - Now player1 is at pos42, stone1 is at pos41 (a goal location).

That's it! The stone is now at a goal location.

Let me double-check the preconditions for each action:

1. "move player1 pos45 pos44 dirup":
   - player1 is at pos45. ✓
   - pos44 is clear. ✓
   - You can move from pos45 to pos44 following direction dirup. ✓

2. "move player1 pos44 pos43 dirup":
   - player1 is at pos44. ✓
   - pos43 is clear. ✓
   - You can move from pos44 to pos43 following direction dirup. ✓

3. "move player1 pos43 pos42 dirup":
   - player1 is at pos43. ✓
   - pos42 is clear. ✓
   - You can move from pos43 to pos42 following direction dirup. ✓

4. "move player1 pos42 pos41 dirup":
   - player1 is at pos42. ✓
   - pos41 is clear. ✓
   - You can move from pos42 to pos41 following direction dirup. ✓

5. "move player1 pos41 pos31 dirleft":
   - player1 is at pos41. ✓
   - pos31 is clear. ✓
   - You can move from pos41 to pos31 following direction dirleft. ✓

6. "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos32 pos33 dirdown":
   - player1 is at pos31. ✓
   - stone1 is at pos32. ✓
   - pos33 is clear. ✓
   - You can get from pos31 to pos32 following direction dirdown. ✓
   - You can get from pos32 to pos33 following direction dirdown. ✓
   - pos33 is not a goal location. ✓

7. "move player1 pos32 pos42 dirright":
   - player1 is at pos32. ✓
   - pos42 is clear. ✓
   - You can move from pos32 to pos42 following direction dirright. ✓

8. "move player1 pos42 pos43 dirdown":
   - player1 is at pos42. ✓
   - pos43 is clear. ✓
   - You can move from pos42 to pos43 following direction dirdown. ✓

9. "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos33 pos43 dirleft":
   - player1 is at pos43. ✓
   - stone1 is at pos33. ✓
   - pos43 is clear. Wait, player1 is already at pos43, so this is not clear. ✗

There's a problem with step 9. Let me rethink this.

The issue is that in step 9, I'm trying to push stone1 from pos33 to pos43, but player1 is already at pos43.

Let's rework the plan:

1. move player1 pos45 pos44 dirup.
2. move player1 pos44 pos43 dirup.
3. move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft.
4. move player1 pos33 pos32 dirup.
5. move player1 pos32 pos31 dirup.
6. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos32 pos33 dirdown.
   - Now player1 is at pos32, stone1 is at pos33.

7. move player1 pos32 pos33 dirdown.
   That's not right, stone1 is now at pos33.

Let me rethink the plan:

1. move player1 pos45 pos44 dirup.
2. move player1 pos44 pos43 dirup.
3. move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft.
4. move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft.
5. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos32 pos33 dirdown.
   - Now player1 is at pos32, stone1 is at pos33.

6. move player1 pos32 pos42 dirright.
7. move player1 pos42 pos43 dirdown.
8. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos33 pos43 dirleft.
   - Now player1 is at pos33, stone1 is at pos43.

9. move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown.
10. move player1 pos34 pos35 dirdown.
    - Now player1 is at pos35, which satisfies the constraint.

11. move player1 pos35 pos34 dirup.
12. move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright.
13. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos43 pos42 dirup.
    - Now player1 is at pos43, stone1 is at pos42.

14. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos42 pos41 dirup.
    - Now player1 is at pos42, stone1 is at pos41 (a goal location).

Let me verify the preconditions for a couple of the confusing steps:

8. "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos33 pos43 dirleft":
   - player1 is at pos43. ✓
   - stone1 is at pos33. ✓
   - pos43 is clear. Wait, player1 is already at pos43, so this is not clear. ✗

I keep making the same mistake. Let me rethink step 8.

The issue with step 8 is that I'm trying to push stone1 from pos33 to pos43, but I'm saying that player1 is at pos43. According to the preconditions, player1 needs to be adjacent to the stone in the direction from which they're pushing. If player1 is pushing stone1 from pos33 to pos43 (which is to the right), then player1 should be at pos23, not pos43.

Alright, let's rework the plan one more time:

1. move player1 pos45 pos44 dirup.
2. move player1 pos44 pos43 dirup.
3. move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft.
4. move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft.
5. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos32 pos33 dirdown.
   - Now player1 is at pos32, stone1 is at pos33.

6. move player1 pos32 pos22 dirleft.
7. move player1 pos22 pos23 dirdown.
8. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos33 pos43 dirright.
   - Now player1 is at pos33, stone1 is at pos43.

That's looking better.

9. move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown.
10. move player1 pos34 pos35 dirdown.
    - Now player1 is at pos35, which satisfies the constraint.

11. move player1 pos35 pos34 dirup.
12. move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright.
13. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos43 pos42 dirup.
    - Now player1 is at pos43, stone1 is at pos42.

14. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos42 pos41 dirup.
    - Now player1 is at pos42, stone1 is at pos41 (a goal location).

Let me verify a couple of the preconditions:

5. "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos32 pos33 dirdown":
   - player1 is at pos23. ✓
   - stone1 is at pos32. ✓
   - pos33 is clear. ✓
   - You can get from pos23 to pos32 following direction dirdown. ✓
   - You can get from pos32 to pos33 following direction dirdown. ✓
   - pos33 is not a goal location. ✓

8. "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos33 pos43 dirright":
   - player1 is at pos23. ✓
   - stone1 is at pos33. ✓
   - pos43 is clear. ✓
   - You can get from pos23 to pos33 following direction dirright. ✓
   - You can get from pos33 to pos43 following direction dirright. ✓
   - pos43 is not a goal location. ✓

13. "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos43 pos42 dirup":
   - player1 is at pos44. ✓
   - stone1 is at pos43. ✓
   - pos42 is clear. ✓
   - You can get from pos44 to pos43 following direction dirup. ✓
   - You can get from pos43 to pos42 following direction dirup. ✓
   - pos42 is not a goal location. ✓

14. "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos42 pos41 dirup":
   - player1 is at pos43. ✓
   - stone1 is at pos42. ✓
   - pos41 is clear. ✓
   - You can get from pos43 to pos42 following direction dirup. ✓
   - You can get from pos42 to pos41 following direction dirup. ✓
   - pos41 is a goal location. ✓

This plan should be correct:

1. move player1 pos45 pos44 dirup.
2. move player1 pos44 pos43 dirup.
3. move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft.
4. move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft.
5. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos32 pos33 dirdown.
6. move player1 pos32 pos22 dirleft.
7. move player1 pos22 pos23 dirdown.
8. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos33 pos43 dirright.
9. move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown.
10. move player1 pos34 pos35 dirdown.
11. move player1 pos35 pos34 dirup.
12. move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright.
13. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos43 pos42 dirup.
14. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos42 pos41 dirup.

I think this plan should be correct, but let me make sure that the directions are right in the push actions. I need to double-check the direction that the agent pushes in the push actions.

For "pushtonongoal p s l_p l_from l_to d", the direction d is the direction in which the stone is pushed, not the direction from which the agent pushes.

Let's make sure:

5. "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos32 pos33 dirdown":
   - The stone is pushed from pos32 to pos33, which is downward. ✓

8. "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos33 pos43 dirright":
   - The stone is pushed from pos33 to pos43, which is to the right. ✓

13. "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos43 pos42 dirup":
   - The stone is pushed from pos43 to pos42, which is upward. ✓

14. "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos42 pos41 dirup":
   - The stone is pushed from pos42 to pos41, which is upward. ✓

Now, let me think about the constraint: "If expression "player1 is at location pos35" holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: "stone1 is at location pos33"."

In our plan, stone1 is at pos33 after step 5 and player1 is at pos35 after step 10. So this constraint is satisfied.

The final plan that I have is optimal, and it is:

1. move player1 pos45 pos44 dirup
2. move player1 pos44 pos43 dirup
3. move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft
4. move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft
5. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos32 pos33 dirdown
6. move player1 pos32 pos22 dirleft
7. move player1 pos22 pos23 dirdown
8. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos33 pos43 dirright
9. move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown
10. move player1 pos34 pos35 dirdown
11. move player1 pos35 pos34 dirup
12. move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright
13. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos43 pos42 dirup
14. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos42 pos41 dirup

This plan:
- Moves stone1 to pos41 (which is a goal location).
- Ensures that stone1 passes through pos33 at one point (after step 5).
- Ensures that player1 passes through pos35 at one point (after step 10).
- Makes sure that player1 is at pos35 (step 10) after stone1 is at pos33 (step 5), satisfying the constraint.

So, the solution is:

```
move player1 pos45 pos44 dirup
move player1 pos44 pos43 dirup
move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft
move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos32 pos33 dirdown
move player1 pos32 pos22 dirleft
move player1 pos22 pos23 dirdown
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos33 pos43 dirright
move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown
move player1 pos34 pos35 dirdown
move player1 pos35 pos34 dirup
move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos43 pos42 dirup
pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos42 pos41 dirup
```
