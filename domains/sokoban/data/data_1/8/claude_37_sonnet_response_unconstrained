Let me understand the problem first:

We have a 2D grid where:
- The agent (player1) is at position pos52
- A stone (stone1) is at position pos42
- There's a goal location at pos34
- The objective is to move the stone to the goal location

I need to determine how to move the agent in order to push the stone to the goal location pos34.

First, let me understand the grid layout. From the given transitions, it seems like the grid is:
```
pos11 pos12 pos13 pos14 pos15
pos21 pos22 pos23 pos24 pos25
pos31 pos32 pos33 pos34 pos35
pos41 pos42 pos43 pos44 pos45
pos51 pos52 pos53 pos54 pos55
```

The agent's initial position is pos52, and the stone's initial position is pos42. The goal location is pos34.

To push the stone to the goal location pos34, I need to get the agent to a position from which it can push the stone towards the goal. I'll need to use the actions:
- "move" to reposition the agent
- "pushtogoal" to push the stone to the goal location (since the goal location is pos34)
- "pushtonongoal" to push the stone to a non-goal location if needed in the intermediate steps

Let's visualize:
```
. . . . .  (pos11-pos15)
. . . . .  (pos21-pos25)
. . . G .  (pos31-pos35) (G represents goal pos34)
. S . . .  (pos41-pos45) (S represents stone1 at pos42)
. A . . .  (pos51-pos55) (A represents agent at pos52)
```

The stone needs to be pushed from pos42 to pos34. Let's plan the route:

From pos42 to pos34, the stone needs to move left and then down. That's 2 pushes: first to pos32, then to pos33, and finally to pos34 (which is the goal).

For these pushes, the agent needs to be in the right position. Let's plan the steps:

1. The agent starts at pos52 and needs to push the stone from pos42 towards pos32. For this, the agent needs to be at pos52.

2. After the push, the stone would be at pos32 and the agent would be at pos42.

3. To push the stone from pos32 to pos33, the agent needs to be at pos31. So, the agent needs to move from pos42 to pos31.

4. After this push, the stone would be at pos33 and the agent would be at pos32.

5. To push the stone from pos33 to pos34 (goal), the agent needs to be at pos33. So, the agent needs to move from pos32 to pos33.

6. After this push, the stone would be at pos34 (goal) and the agent would be at pos33.

Now, let's create the actual plan using the provided actions.

Step 1: Push the stone from pos42 to pos32.
The agent is already at pos52, which is the right position to push the stone towards pos32.
Action: "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos52 pos42 pos32 dirleft"

Step 2: Move the agent from pos42 to pos31.
Action: "move player1 pos42 pos32 dirleft"
Action: "move player1 pos32 pos31 dirup"

Step 3: Push the stone from pos32 to pos33.
Action: "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos32 pos33 dirdown"

Step 4: Push the stone from pos33 to pos34 (goal).
Action: "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos33 pos34 dirdown"

Actually, I think this plan won't work. Let me re-evaluate.

Let's check the constraints for the "push" actions:

For "pushtonongoal" and "pushtogoal":
- Agent p is at location l_p
- Stone s is at location l_from
- Location l_to is clear
- You can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d
- You can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d

For the first push (from pos42 to pos32), the agent is at pos52, and to get to pos42 from pos52, the direction is dirleft (the agent would be "pushing" the stone from right to left). However, the stone would move from pos42 to pos32, which is not the direction dirleft from pos42. The direction from pos42 to pos32 is dirleft. So, I need to make sure the directions align correctly.

Let's redraw the grid with directions:

Directions:
- dirup: Move from row i to row i-1 (moving up in the grid)
- dirdown: Move from row i to row i+1 (moving down in the grid)
- dirleft: Move from column j to column j-1 (moving left in the grid)
- dirright: Move from column j to column j+1 (moving right in the grid)

Re-planning:

1. The agent starts at pos52 and wants to push the stone from pos42 to pos32. The agent needs to be at pos52, which is the right position to push the stone towards pos32. The direction from pos52 to pos42 is dirleft, and the direction from pos42 to pos32 is also dirleft.
Action: "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos52 pos42 pos32 dirleft"

2. After the push, the stone would be at pos32 and the agent would be at pos42.

3. To push the stone from pos32 to pos33, the agent needs to be at pos31 (which is to the left of the stone). The direction from pos31 to pos32 is dirright, and the direction from pos32 to pos33 is dirdown.
First, the agent needs to move from pos42 to pos31.
Action: "move player1 pos42 pos32 dirleft" (Now agent is at pos32)
Action: "move player1 pos32 pos31 dirleft" (Now agent is at pos31)

But wait, to push from pos32 to pos33, the agent needs to be at a position from which it can push in the direction dirdown. So, the agent should be at pos32, not pos31.

Actually, after the first push, the stone is at pos32 and the agent is at pos42. To push the stone from pos32 to pos33, the agent needs to be above the stone, which means at pos22.

From pos42, the agent needs to move to pos22.
Action: "move player1 pos42 pos32 dirleft" (Now agent is at pos32)
Action: "move player1 pos32 pos22 dirup" (Now agent is at pos22)

Now, the agent is at pos22, and to push the stone from pos32 to pos33, the direction from pos22 to pos32 is dirdown, and the direction from pos32 to pos33 is also dirdown.
Action: "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos32 pos33 dirdown"

After this push, the stone would be at pos33 and the agent would be at pos32.

4. To push the stone from pos33 to pos34 (goal), the agent needs to be at pos23 (which is above the stone). The direction from pos23 to pos33 is dirdown, and the direction from pos33 to pos34 is dirright.
First, the agent needs to move from pos32 to pos23.
Action: "move player1 pos32 pos22 dirup" (Now agent is at pos22)
Action: "move player1 pos22 pos23 dirdown" (Now agent is at pos23)

Now, the agent can push the stone from pos33 to pos34 (goal).
Action: "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos33 pos34 dirright"

After this push, the stone would be at pos34 (goal) and the agent would be at pos33.

I feel like I'm overcomplicating things, let's double check the rules again.

When pushing a stone, the agent has to be on one side of the stone, and the destination has to be on the opposite side. For "pushtogoal" and "pushtonongoal", the action requires:
- The agent is at l_p
- The stone is at l_from
- The agent can go from l_p to l_from following direction d
- The stone can go from l_from to l_to following the same direction d

Ok, so when pushing, the agent and the stone's destination should be on opposite sides of the stone, and the direction should be consistent.

For "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos52 pos42 pos32 dirleft", we're saying the agent is at pos52, the stone is at pos42, and we want to push the stone to pos32. The agent can go from pos52 to pos42 following dirleft, and the stone can go from pos42 to pos32 following the same direction dirleft. So, this action seems valid.

Let's redraw the grid and see the state after this action:
```
. . . . .  (pos11-pos15)
. . . . .  (pos21-pos25)
. S . G .  (pos31-pos35) (G represents goal pos34, S is the stone1 after the push)
. A . . .  (pos41-pos45) (A is the agent after the push)
. . . . .  (pos51-pos55)
```

Now, to push the stone from pos32 to pos33, the agent would need to be at a position such that the agent, stone, and the destination form a straight line. The agent would need to be at pos31, and the direction would be dirright.

For "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos32 pos33 dirright", we're saying the agent is at pos31, the stone is at pos32, and we want to push the stone to pos33. The agent can go from pos31 to pos32 following dirright, and the stone can go from pos32 to pos33 following the same direction dirright. So, this action seems valid.

But how do I move the agent from pos42 to pos31?
Action: "move player1 pos42 pos41 dirleft" (Now agent is at pos41)
Action: "move player1 pos41 pos31 dirup" (Now agent is at pos31)

After the second push, the grid would look like:
```
. . . . .  (pos11-pos15)
. . . . .  (pos21-pos25)
A S . G .  (pos31-pos35) (G represents goal pos34, S is the stone1 after the push)
. . . . .  (pos41-pos45)
. . . . .  (pos51-pos55)
```

Now, to push the stone from pos33 to pos34 (goal), the agent would need to be at pos32, and the direction would be dirright.

For "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos33 pos34 dirright", we're saying the agent is at pos32, the stone is at pos33, and we want to push the stone to pos34. The agent can go from pos32 to pos33 following dirright, and the stone can go from pos33 to pos34 following the same direction dirright. So, this action seems valid.

Actually, wait I made a mistake. The above "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos32 pos33 dirright" should be a push toward pos33, which is to the right of pos32. But I said "dirright", which means the direction is from agent to stone, not from stone to destination. Let me redraw this.

Ok, let's redraw the grid and try again:
```
. . . . .  (pos11-pos15)
. . . . .  (pos21-pos25)
. . . G .  (pos31-pos35) (G represents goal pos34)
. S . . .  (pos41-pos45) (S represents stone1 at pos42)
. A . . .  (pos51-pos55) (A represents agent at pos52)
```

Let me try to think about the pushing in a different way. The action format is "pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d", where d is the direction from l_p to l_from.

But there's another condition: "You can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d". This means the direction from l_p to l_from should be the same as the direction from l_from to l_to.

So, for "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos52 pos42 pos32 dirleft", the agent is at pos52, the stone is at pos42, and we want to push the stone to pos32. The direction from pos52 to pos42 is dirleft, and the direction from pos42 to pos32 is also dirleft. So, this action seems valid.

After this push, the grid would look like:
```
. . . . .  (pos11-pos15)
. . . . .  (pos21-pos25)
. S . G .  (pos31-pos35) (G represents goal pos34, S is the stone1 after the push)
. A . . .  (pos41-pos45) (A is the agent after the push)
. . . . .  (pos51-pos55)
```

Now, to push the stone from pos32 to pos33, the agent would need to be at a position such that the direction from the agent to the stone is the same as the direction from the stone to the destination. If the stone is at pos32 and we want to push it to pos33, the direction from pos32 to pos33 is dirdown. So, the agent would need to be at a position such that the direction from the agent to the stone is also dirdown. This would be pos22.

To move the agent from pos42 to pos22, I can use:
Action: "move player1 pos42 pos32 dirleft" (Now agent is at pos32)
Action: "move player1 pos32 pos22 dirup" (Now agent is at pos22)

Now, the agent can push the stone from pos32 to pos33:
Action: "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos32 pos33 dirdown"

After this push, the grid would look like:
```
. . . . .  (pos11-pos15)
. A . . .  (pos21-pos25) (A is the agent after the push)
. . S G .  (pos31-pos35) (G represents goal pos34, S is the stone1 after the push)
. . . . .  (pos41-pos45)
. . . . .  (pos51-pos55)
```

Finally, to push the stone from pos33 to pos34 (goal), the agent would need to be at a position such that the direction from the agent to the stone is the same as the direction from the stone to the destination. If the stone is at pos33 and we want to push it to pos34, the direction from pos33 to pos34 is dirright. So, the agent would need to be at a position such that the direction from the agent to the stone is also dirright. This would be pos23.

To move the agent from pos32 (after the second push) to pos23, I can use:
Action: "move player1 pos32 pos22 dirup" (Now agent is at pos22)
Action: "move player1 pos22 pos23 dirdown" (Now agent is at pos23)

Wait, I think I made an error. After pushing the stone from pos32 to pos33, the agent would be at pos32, not at pos22. Let me fix this.

After the second push, the grid would look like:
```
. . . . .  (pos11-pos15)
. . . . .  (pos21-pos25)
. A S G .  (pos31-pos35) (G represents goal pos34, S is the stone1 after the push, A is the agent after the push)
. . . . .  (pos41-pos45)
. . . . .  (pos51-pos55)
```

Now, to push the stone from pos33 to pos34 (goal), the agent would need to be at a position such that the direction from the agent to the stone is the same as the direction from the stone to the destination. If the stone is at pos33 and we want to push it to pos34, the direction from pos33 to pos34 is dirright. So, the agent would need to be at a position such that the direction from the agent to the stone is also dirright. This would be pos23.

To move the agent from pos32 to pos23, I can use:
Action: "move player1 pos32 pos22 dirup" (Now agent is at pos22)
Action: "move player1 pos22 pos23 dirdown" (Now agent is at pos23)

But we don't need these extra steps. After the agent is at pos32, it cannot push the stone from pos33 to pos34 directly from pos32. The agent needs to get to a position from which it can push the stone in the direction dirright, which would be pos23.

Actually, let me go back and check the rules again. The precondition for "pushtogoal" states:
"You may only perform this action if (i) agent p is at location l_p, (ii) stone s is at location l_from, (iii) location l_to is clear, (iv) you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d, (v) you can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d, and (vi) location l_to is a goal location."

This means for "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos33 pos34 dirright", the agent should be at pos23, the stone at pos33, and we want to push the stone to pos34. The direction from pos23 to pos33 is dirright, and the direction from pos33 to pos34 is also dirright. This is satisfied. The other condition, location l_to (pos34) is a goal location, is also satisfied. So, this action is valid.

Ok, I think my understanding of the rules are now correct. Let me redraw the grid again and create the full plan:

The agent starts at pos52, and the stone starts at pos42. The goal location is pos34.
```
. . . . .  (pos11-pos15)
. . . . .  (pos21-pos25)
. . . G .  (pos31-pos35) (G represents goal pos34)
. S . . .  (pos41-pos45) (S represents stone1 at pos42)
. A . . .  (pos51-pos55) (A represents agent at pos52)
```

Here's the plan:

1. Push the stone from pos42 to pos32:
   Action: "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos52 pos42 pos32 dirleft"
   Now, the agent is at pos42 and the stone is at pos32.

2. Move the agent to a position from which it can push the stone from pos32 to pos33:
   Action: "move player1 pos42 pos32 dirleft" (Now agent is at pos32)
   Action: "move player1 pos32 pos22 dirup" (Now agent is at pos22)

3. Push the stone from pos32 to pos33:
   Action: "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos32 pos33 dirdown"
   Now, the agent is at pos32 and the stone is at pos33.

4. Move the agent to a position from which it can push the stone from pos33 to pos34 (goal):
   Action: "move player1 pos32 pos22 dirup" (Now agent is at pos22)
   Action: "move player1 pos22 pos23 dirdown" (Now agent is at pos23)

5. Push the stone from pos33 to pos34 (goal):
   Action: "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos33 pos34 dirright"
   Now, the agent is at pos33 and the stone is at pos34 (goal).

Let me check if this plan is consistent:

Step 1: "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos52 pos42 pos32 dirleft"
Preconditions: 
- Agent is at pos52 (True in the initial state)
- Stone is at pos42 (True in the initial state)
- pos32 is clear (True in the initial state)
- The agent can move from pos52 to pos42 following dirleft (True, based on the transitions given)
- The stone can move from pos42 to pos32 following dirleft (True, based on the transitions given)
- pos32 is not a goal location (True in the initial state)
Effects:
- Agent is at pos42
- Stone is at pos32
- pos52 is clear

Step 2a: "move player1 pos42 pos32 dirleft"
Preconditions:
- Agent is at pos42 (True after Step 1)
- pos32 is clear (False after Step 1, the stone is at pos32)

So, the agent can't move directly from pos42 to pos32. I need to think about another route.

After Step 1, the agent is at pos42 and the stone is at pos32. The agent needs to get to a position from which it can push the stone from pos32 to pos33. This would be pos22 (the position above the stone, from which the agent can push the stone downwards from pos32 to pos33).

To reach pos22 from pos42, the agent can move:
Action: "move player1 pos42 pos41 dirleft" (Now agent is at pos41)
Action: "move player1 pos41 pos31 dirup" (Now agent is at pos31)
Action: "move player1 pos31 pos21 dirup" (Now agent is at pos21)
Action: "move player1 pos21 pos22 dirdown" (Now agent is at pos22)

Now, from pos22, the agent can push the stone from pos32 to pos33.

So, let's refactor our plan:

1. Push the stone from pos42 to pos32:
   Action: "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos52 pos42 pos32 dirleft"
   Now, the agent is at pos42 and the stone is at pos32.

2. Move the agent to a position from which it can push the stone from pos32 to pos33:
   Action: "move player1 pos42 pos41 dirleft" (Now agent is at pos41)
   Action: "move player1 pos41 pos31 dirup" (Now agent is at pos31)
   Action: "move player1 pos31 pos21 dirup" (Now agent is at pos21)
   Action: "move player1 pos21 pos22 dirdown" (Now agent is at pos22)

3. Push the stone from pos32 to pos33:
   Action: "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos32 pos33 dirdown"
   Now, the agent is at pos32 and the stone is at pos33.

4. Move the agent to a position from which it can push the stone from pos33 to pos34 (goal):
   Action: "move player1 pos32 pos22 dirup" (Now agent is at pos22)
   Action: "move player1 pos22 pos23 dirdown" (Now agent is at pos23)

5. Push the stone from pos33 to pos34 (goal):
   Action: "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos33 pos34 dirright"
   Now, the agent is at pos33 and the stone is at pos34 (goal).

Let's re-check the plan for consistency:

Step 1: "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos52 pos42 pos32 dirleft"
Preconditions: 
- Agent is at pos52 (True in the initial state)

Preconditions:
- Agent is at pos41 (True after Step 2a)

Preconditions:
- Agent is at pos31 (True after Step 2b)
- pos21 is clear (True in the initial state)
- The agent can move from pos31 to pos21 following dirup (True, based on the transitions given)
Effects:
- Agent is at pos21

Step 2d: "move player1 pos21 pos22 dirdown"
Preconditions:
- Agent is at pos21 (True after Step 2c)
- pos22 is clear (True in the initial state)

- pos21 is clear

Step 3: "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos32 pos33 dirdown"
Preconditions:
- Agent is at pos22 (True after Step 2d)
- Stone is at pos32 (True after Step 1)
- pos33 is clear (True in the initial state)
- The agent can move from pos22 to pos32 following dirdown (True, based on the transitions given)
- The stone can move from pos32 to pos33 following dirdown (True, based on the transitions given)
- pos33 is not a goal location (True in the initial state)
Effects:
- Agent is at pos32
- Stone is at pos33
- pos22 is clear

Step 4a: "move player1 pos32 pos22 dirup"
Preconditions:
- Agent is at pos32 (True after Step 3)
- pos22 is clear (True after Step 3)
- The agent can move from pos32 to pos22 following dirup (True, based on the transitions given)
Effects:
- Agent is at pos22
- pos32 is clear

Step 4b: "move player1 pos22 pos23 dirdown"
Preconditions:
- Agent is at pos22 (True after Step 4a)
- pos23 is clear (True in the initial state)
- The agent can move from pos22 to pos23, following dirdown (True, based on the transitions given)
Effects:
- Agent is at pos23
- pos22 is clear

Step 5: "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos33 pos34 dirright"
Preconditions:
- Agent is at pos23 (True after Step 4b)
- Stone is at pos33 (True after Step 3)
- pos34 is clear (True in the initial state)
- The agent can move from pos23 to pos33 following dirright (True, based on the transitions given)

- pos34 is a goal location (True in the initial state)
Effects:
- Agent is at pos33
- Stone is at pos34
- pos23 is clear
- The stone is at a goal location

All steps in the plan are consistent, and the final state ensures that the stone is at a goal location, which satisfies the objective. The plan is valid.

Actually, let me double check that the effects after "pushtonongoal" and "pushtogoal" is correct.
The effects of "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos52 pos42 pos32 dirleft" should include:
- Agent is at pos42 (the agent moves to the position where the stone was)
- Stone is at pos32 (the stone is pushed to a non-goal location)
- pos52 is clear (the agent's original position is now clear)
- The stone is at a non-goal location (explicitly mentioned in the effects)

I think the overall plan is correct, but I was mistaken about the effects of the action in Step 1. After "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos52 pos42 pos32 dirleft", the agent would be at pos42, the stone would be at pos32, and pos52 would be clear.

Here's the final plan in its correct sequence:

1. Push the stone from pos42 to pos32:
   Action: "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos52 pos42 pos32 dirleft"
   Now, the agent is at pos42 and the stone is at pos32.

2. Move the agent to a position from which it can push the stone from pos32 to pos33:
   Action: "move player1 pos42 pos41 dirleft" (Now agent is at pos41)
   Action: "move player1 pos41 pos31 dirup" (Now agent is at pos31)
   Action: "move player1 pos31 pos21 dirup" (Now agent is at pos21)
   Action: "move player1 pos21 pos22 dirdown" (Now agent is at pos22)

3. Push the stone from pos32 to pos33:
   Action: "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos32 pos33 dirdown"
   Now, the agent is at pos32 and the stone is at pos33.

4. Move the agent to a position from which it can push the stone from pos33 to pos34 (goal):
   Action: "move player1 pos32 pos22 dirup" (Now agent is at pos22)
   Action: "move player1 pos22 pos23 dirdown" (Now agent is at pos23)

5. Push the stone from pos33 to pos34 (goal):
   Action: "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos33 pos34 dirright"
   Now, the agent is at pos33 and the stone is at pos34 (goal).

Hmm, I think I'm still making an error in my understanding of the directions. Let me go back to the problem statement and check the definition of directions again.

I think my understanding was correct. "dirdown" means moving from a smaller row number to a larger row number. "dirleft" means moving from a larger column number to a smaller column number. And the direction specified in the action is the direction from the agent's position to the stone's position, which should be the same as the direction from the stone's position to the destination.

wait but I just realized, the directions dirup, dirdown, dirleft, dirright are objects from "direction" class. They are not neccesarily aligned with the board. Let's look at the transition information to understand the directions:

"You may move from location pos22 to location pos12 following direction dirleft" - this suggests that moving from pos22 to pos12 follows "dirleft", which is moving leftward and not upward.

"You may move from location pos22 to location pos32 following direction dirright" - this suggests that moving from pos22 to pos32 follows "dirright", which is moving rightward and not downward.

"You may move from location pos22 to location pos21 following direction dirup" - this suggests that moving from pos22 to pos21 follows "dirup", which is moving upward.

"You may move from location pos22 to location pos23 following direction dirdown" - this suggests that moving from pos22 to pos23 follows "dirdown", which is moving downward.

This makes sense, so dirup is moving from a higher to a lower row number, dirdown is moving from a lower to a higher row number, dirleft is moving from a higher to a lower column number, and dirright is moving from a lower to a higher column number.

Ok actually my interpretation of the directions in the original plan was correct.

Let's double check the actions one by one.

1. "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos52 pos42 pos32 dirleft"
Checking the direction from pos52 to pos42, it's the same as moving from a higher position to a lower position in the grid, which is dirleft. The same for moving from pos42 to pos32, which is also dirleft.
Preconditions:
- Agent is at pos52 (True in the initial state)
- Stone is at pos42 (True in the initial state)
- pos32 is clear (True in the initial state)
- The agent can move from pos52 to pos42 following dirleft (True, based on the transitions given)
- The stone can move from pos42 to pos32 following dirleft (True, based on the transitions given)
- pos32 is not a goal location (True in the initial state)
Effects:
- The agent is no longer at pos52
- The stone is no longer at pos42
- pos32 is no longer clear
- The agent is at pos42
- The stone is at pos32
- pos52 is clear
- The stone is at a non-goal location

Step 2a: "move player1 pos42 pos41 dirleft"
Checking the direction from pos42 to pos41, it's the same as moving from a higher position to a lower position in the grid, which is dirleft.
Preconditions:
- The agent is at pos42 (True after Step 1)
- pos41 is clear (True in the initial state)
- The agent can move from pos42 to pos41 following dirleft (True, based on the transitions given)
Effects:
- The agent is no longer at pos42
- pos41 is no longer clear
- The agent is at pos41
- pos42 is clear

Step 2b: "move player1 pos41 pos31 dirup"
Checking the direction from pos41 to pos31, it's the same as moving from a lower row to a higher row in the grid, which is dirup.
Preconditions:
- The agent is at pos41 (True after Step 2a)
- pos31 is clear (True in the initial state)
- The agent can move from pos41 to pos31 following dirup (True, based on the transitions given)
Effects:
- The agent is no longer at pos41
- pos31 is no longer clear
- The agent is at pos31
- pos41 is clear

Wait, I think I'm incorrect about the directions. From the transition information:
"You may move from location pos41 to location pos31 following direction dirleft"

According to me, moving from pos41 to pos31 should follow direction dirup. But the transition information says it's dirleft. This is confusing.

Let me check a few other transitions:
"You may move from location pos41 to location pos42 following direction dirdown"
"You may move from location pos31 to location pos41 following direction dirright"

From pos31 to pos41, it follows dirright (which I would expect as moving from a lower row to a higher row). But from pos41 to pos31, it follows dirleft (which I would expect as moving from a higher column to a lower column).

My confusion was about the naming of the positions. Let me see if I can understand the naming:
"pos31" - does this mean row 3, column 1?
"pos41" - does this mean row 4, column 1?

In thinking about it, I believe the most likely interpretation is that the first digit in the naming indicates the row (y-coordinate) and the second digit indicates the column (x-coordinate). Let me check if this is consistent with the transitions.

"You may move from location pos31 (row 3, col 1) to location pos41 (row 4, col 1) following direction dirright"
So, moving from row 3 to row 4 while staying in the same column follows dirright.

"You may move from location pos41 (row 4, col 1) to location pos31 (row 3, col 1) following direction dirleft"
So, moving from row 4 to row 3 while staying in the same column follows dirleft.

"You may move from location pos31 (row 3, col 1) to location pos32 (row 3, col 2) following direction dirdown"
So, moving from col 1 to col 2 while staying in the same row follows dirdown.

"You may move from location pos32 (row 3, col 2) to location pos31 (row 3, col 1) following direction dirup"
So, moving from col 2 to col 1 while staying in the same row follows dirup.

This indeed seems to be different from my original interpretation of the directions. I was thinking of the grid with the first row at the top and the leftmost column at the left, where moving up means decreasing the row number, and moving left means decreasing the column number.

But, based on the transitions, it appears that the directions are:
- dirright: Move from a lower row number to a higher row number
- dirleft: Move from a higher row number to a lower row number
- dirdown: Move from a lower column number to a higher column number
- dirup: Move from a higher column number to a lower column number

That's a different convention than I expected.

Let me redraw the grid based on this understanding:
```
(pos11) (pos12) (pos13) (pos14) (pos15)
(pos21) (pos22) (pos23) (pos24) (pos25)
(pos31) (pos32) (pos33) (pos34) (pos35)
(pos41) (pos42) (pos43) (pos44) (pos45)
(pos51) (pos52) (pos53) (pos54) (pos55)
```

The agent is at pos52 (row 5, col 2), the stone is at pos42 (row 4, col 2), and the goal is at pos34 (row 3, col 4). 

Here, the goal and the stone are not in the same column, so the agent needs to push the stone rightward first, and then upward.

I think it's more straightforward to check the transitions to understand how to move between positions:

From the transition list:

"You may move from location pos42 to location pos32 following direction dirleft"
So to move from pos42 to pos32, follow dirleft.

"You may move from location pos32 to location pos33 following direction dirdown"
So to move from pos32 to pos33, follow dirdown.

"You may move from location pos33 to location pos34 following direction dirdown"
So to move from pos33 to pos34, follow dirdown.

Given this, the plan should be:

1. Push the stone from pos42 to pos32:
   Action: "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos52 pos42 pos32 dirleft"
   Now, the agent is at pos42 and the stone is at pos32.

2. Push the stone from pos32 to pos33:
   The agent needs to be at a position from which it can push the stone from pos32 to pos33 following dirdown. This would be pos31.
   First, the agent needs to move from pos42 to pos31.
   Action: "move player1 pos42 pos41 dirleft" (Now agent is at pos41)
   Action: "move player1 pos41 pos31 dirleft" (Now agent is at pos31)
   Action: "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos32 pos33 dirdown"
   Now, the agent is at pos32 and the stone is at pos33.

3. Push the stone from pos33 to pos34 (goal):
   The agent needs to be at a position from which it can push the stone from pos33 to pos34 following dirdown. This would be pos32.
   The agent is already at pos32 after the previous step, so no additional movement is required.
   Action: "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos33 pos34 dirdown"
   Now, the agent is at pos33 and the stone is at pos34 (goal).

Let's double check this plan for consistency.

step 1: "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos52 pos42 pos32 dirleft"
After this action, the agent is at pos42 and the stone is at pos32. Pos52 is clear.

step 2a: "move player1 pos42 pos41 dirleft"
After this action, the agent is at pos41. Pos42 is clear.

step 2b: "move player1 pos41 pos31 dirleft"
After this action, the agent is at pos31. Pos41 is clear.

step 2c: "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos32 pos33 dirdown"
This requires: agent at pos31, stone at pos32, pos33 clear, direction from pos31 to pos32 is dirdown, direction from pos32 to pos33, is also dirdown. But this is not satisfied. The direction from pos31 to pos32 is not dirdown. From the transitions: "You may move from location pos31 to location pos32 following direction dirdown". So, dirdown is the direction from pos31 to pos32, which does align with the direction from pos32 to pos33, which is also "dirdown" based on "You may move from location pos32 to location pos33 following direction dirdown".

So, the action "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos32 pos33 dirdown" seems valid.

After this action, the agent is at pos32 and the stone is at pos33. Pos31 is clear.

Step 3: "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos33 pos34 dirdown"
This requires: agent at pos32, stone at pos33, pos34 clear, direction from pos32 to pos33 is dirdown, direction from pos33 to pos34 is also dirdown. Again, checking from the transitions: "You may move from location pos32 to location pos33 following direction dirdown" and "You may move from location pos33 to location pos34 following direction dirdown", both are "dirdown". So, this action is valid.

Actually I think I found another error. I realize the actions I wrote don't match what I said the plan should be. Let me fix the plan.

The plan should be:

Step 1: "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos52 pos42 pos32 dirleft"
After this action, the agent is at pos42 and the stone is at pos32. Pos52 is clear.

Step 2a: "move player1 pos42 pos41 dirleft"
After this action, the agent is at pos41. Pos42 is clear.

Step 2b: "move player1 pos41 pos31 dirleft"
After this action, the agent is at pos31. Pos41 is clear.

Step 2c: "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos32 pos33 dirdown"
After this action, the agent is at pos32 and the stone is at pos33. Pos31 is clear.

Step 3: "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos33 pos34 dirdown"
After this action, the agent is at pos33 and the stone is at pos34 (goal). Pos32 is clear.

Actually, the plan now looks correct. Let me double-check the initial directions:

"You may move from location pos31 to location pos32 following direction dirdown"
This means going from pos31 to pos32 is following dirdown.

"You may move from location pos32 to location pos33 following direction dirdown"
This means going from pos32 to pos33 is following dirdown.

"You may move from location pos33 to location pos34 following direction dirdown"
This means going from pos33 to pos34 is following dirdown.

It seems like the naming of the positions in this grid is such that increasing the second digit (the column) corresponds to moving in the dirdown direction. Similarly, decreasing the first digit (the row) corresponds to moving in the dirleft direction. This is indeed a bit different from traditional grid naming conventions, but that's not a problem as long as we have clear transition information.

So, based on the transition information:
- Moving from row i to row i-1 (decreasing row) corresponds to dirleft.
- Moving from row i to row i+1 (increasing row) corresponds to dirright.
- Moving from column j to column j-1 (decreasing column) corresponds to dirup.
- Moving from column j to column j+1 (increasing column) corresponds to dirdown.

Given this understanding, I think the plan I've provided is correct. Let's make sure:

Step 1: "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos52 pos42 pos32 dirleft"
In this action, the agent is pushing the stone from pos42 to pos32, which means decreasing the row, which is dirleft.

Step 2c: "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos32 pos33 dirdown"
In this action, the agent is pushing the stone from pos32 to pos33, which means increasing the column, which is dirdown.

Step 3: "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos33 pos34 dirdown"
In this action, the agent is pushing the stone from pos33 to pos34, which means increasing the column, which is dirdown.

So, all the actions in the plan are correct.

The final plan is:
```
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos52 pos42 pos32 dirleft
move player1 pos42 pos41 dirleft
move player1 pos41 pos31 dirleft
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos32 pos33 dirdown
pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos33 pos34 dirdown
```

This should correctly moves the stone to the goal location.

Actully wait a minute. I should double check if I've correctly interpreted the directions. I'm currently reading them from the transition information, i.e., "You may move from location pos31 to location pos32 following direction dirdown" means moving from pos31 to pos32 is following dirdown.

But the preconditions for the actions also involve the direction:
"move p l_from l_to d": You may only perform this action if (i) agent p is at location l_from, (ii) location l_to is clear, and (iii) you can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d.

"pushtonongoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": You may only perform this action if (i) agent p is at location l_p, (ii) stone s is at location l_from, (iii) location l_to is clear, (iv) you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d, (v) you can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d, and (vi) location l_to is not a goal location.

For the "push" action, the direction 'd' is the direction from where the agent is (l_p) to where the stone is (l_from), and also the direction from where the stone is (l_from) to the destination (l_to). So, the agent, stone, and destination should be in a straight line.

In our plan, for step 1: "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos52 pos42 pos32 dirleft"
- The agent is at pos52.
- The stone is at pos42.
- The direction from pos52 to pos42 is dirleft (from row 5 to row 4).
- The direction from pos42 to pos32 is also dirleft (from row 4 to row 3).
So, this action is consistent.

For step 2c: "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos32 pos33 dirdown"
- The agent is at pos31.
- The stone is at pos32.
- The direction from pos31 to pos32 is dirdown (from column 1 to column 2).
- The direction from pos32 to pos33 is also dirdown (from column 2 to column 3).
So, this action is also consistent.

For step 3: "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos33 pos34 dirdown"
- The agent is at pos32.
- The stone is at pos33.
- The direction from pos32 to pos33 is dirdown (from column 2 to column 3).
- The direction from pos33 to pos34 is also dirdown (from column 3 to column 4).
So, this action is also consistent.

I think the plan is correct, but let me double check the grid layout and check the actions again, to make super sure I'm interpretting the problem correctly.

Consider a 5x5 2D grid, where the positions are labeled as posrc where r is the row (increasing downwards) and c is the column (increasing rightwards).

The agent is at pos52 (row 5, column 2), the stone is at pos42 (row 4, column 2), and the goal is at pos34 (row 3, column 4). The agent needs to push the stone to the goal location.

The "dirdown", "dirup", "dirleft", "dirright" is referring to the direction which we step in. Specifically:
- dirup: move up from a higher row to a lower row (decreasing the first coordinate)
- dirdown: move down from a lower row to a higher row (increasing the first coordinate)
- dirleft: move left from a higher column to a lower column (decreasing the second coordinate)
- dirright: move right from a lower column to a higher column (increasing the second coordinate)

This means the grid looks like:
```
pos11 pos12 pos13 pos14 pos15
pos21 pos22 pos23 pos24 pos25
pos31 pos32 pos33 pos34 pos35
pos41 pos42 pos43 pos44 pos45
pos51 pos52 pos53 pos54 pos55
```

With this interpretation, the directions are clear: dirup means moving up, dirdown means moving down, dirleft means moving left, and dirright means moving right.

Now, to move the stone from pos42 to pos34 (goal), since the stone needs to be pushed by the agent, the agent should be at a position such that the stone is the opposite of the direction of the push. If the agent is at pos52 and the stone is at pos42, pushing the stone upwards would make the stone go to pos32, which is dirup.

So the initial action I thought should be: "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos52 pos42 pos32 dirup".

OK but let me check the preconditions for "pushtonongoal" action and make sure I'm interpretting them correctly.
"pushtonongoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": You may only perform this action if ... (v) you can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d ...

From the transition list, we see "You may move from location pos42 to location pos32 following direction dirleft". This means going from pos42 to pos32 is following dirleft.

But this contradicts my understanding, because going from pos42 to pos32 should be moving up, which is dirup according to my interpretation.

OK so I need to re-interpret the grid. From the transitions:
- "You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright"
- "You may move from location pos11 to location pos12 following direction dirdown"
This suggests that from pos11, going to pos21 is dirright, and going to pos12 is dirdown.

I think I'm better off just interpretting from the transition list:
- "dirright" means moving from posrc to pos(r+1)c (increasing row)
- "dirleft" means moving from posrc to pos(r-1)c (decreasing row)
- "dirdown" means moving from posrc to posr(c+1) (increasing column)
- "dirup" means moving from posrc to posr(c-1) (decreasing column)

So, moving from pos11 to pos21 is dirright, moving from pos21 to pos11 is dirleft, moving from pos11 to pos12 is dirdown, and moving from pos12 to pos11 is dirup.

Ok, the numbering is a bit not traditional, but this is still a typical 2D grid, where increases means going "right" and "down".

Now, to push the stone from pos42 to pos32, the agent should be at pos52, and the direction is dirleft.
For "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos52 pos42 pos32 dirleft", the preconditions are:
- The agent is at pos52 (True in the initial state)
- The stone is at pos42 (True in the initial state)
- pos32 is clear (True in the initial state)
- The agent can go from pos52 to pos42 following dirleft (checking the transition list: "You may move from location pos52 to location pos42 following direction dirleft". True)
- The stone can go from pos42 to pos32 following dirleft (checking the transition list: "You may move from location pos42 to location pos32 following direction dirleft". True)
- pos32 is not a goal location (True in the initial state)

So, the action "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos52 pos42 pos32 dirleft" is valid.

After this push, the agent is at pos42 and the stone is at pos32.

Now, to push the stone from pos32 towards the goal pos34, the agent needs to get to a position from which it can push the stone in the correct direction. The stone needs to move from pos32 to pos34, which is 2 columns to the right.

The agent can push the stone from pos32 to pos33 if it's at pos31 and the push direction is dirdown.
For "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos32 pos33 dirdown", the preconditions are:
- The agent is at pos31 (For this, the agent first to move from pos42 to pos31.)
- The stone is at pos32 (True after the first push)
- pos33 is clear (True in the initial state)
- The agent can go from pos31 to pos32 following dirdown (checking the transition list: "You may move from location pos31 to location pos32 following direction dirdown". True)
- The stone can go from pos32 to pos33 following dirdown (checking the transition list: "You may move from location pos32 to location pos33 following direction dirdown". True)
- pos33 is not a goal location (True in the initial state)

For the agent to move from pos42 to pos31, it can follow:
Action: "move player1 pos42 pos41 dirleft" (Now agent is at pos41)
Action: "move player1 pos41 pos31 dirleft" (Now agent is at pos31)

So, the action "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos32 pos33 dirdown" is valid, but only after the agent has moved to pos31.

After this push, the agent is at pos32 and the stone is at pos33.

Finally, to push the stone from pos33 to pos34 (goal), the agent needs to be at pos32 and the push direction is dirdown.
For "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos33 pos34 dirdown", the preconditions are:
- The agent is at pos32 (True after the second push)
- The stone is at pos33 (True after the second push)
- pos34 is clear (True in the initial state)
- The agent can go from pos32 to pos33 following dirdown (checking the transition list: "You may move from location pos32 to location pos33 following direction dirdown". True)
- The stone can go from pos33 to pos34 following dirdown (checking the transition list: "You may move from location pos33 to location pos34 following direction dirdown". True)
- pos34 is a goal location (True in the initial state)

So, the action "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos33 pos34 dirdown" is valid.

After this push, the agent is at pos33 and the stone is at pos34 (goal).

So the final and correct plan is:
```
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos52 pos42 pos32 dirleft
move player1 pos42 pos41 dirleft
move player1 pos41 pos31 dirleft
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos32 pos33 dirdown
pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos33 pos34 dirdown
```

This should correctly moves the stone to the goal location. And this is the optimal plan, because it uses the minimal number of actions to move the stone to the goal.

Actually, I just realized I'm making a very silly error in interpretting the movement coordinates. In the transition information, there are "you can move from location A to location B following direction D". This just tells me, you can go from A to B by moving in direction D. So from "You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright", I naturally interpret the directions as:
- dirright: Moving right (increasing the first digit, i.e. the row)
- dirleft: Moving left (decreasing the first digit, i.e. the row)
- dirdown: Moving down (increasing the second digit, i.e. the column)
- dirup: Moving up (decreasing the second digit, i.e. the column)

Yes, I think this is the correct interpretation. So the grid is:
```
pos11 pos12 pos13 pos14 pos15
pos21 pos22 pos23 pos24 pos25
pos31 pos32 pos33 pos34 pos35
pos41 pos42 pos43 pos44 pos45
pos51 pos52 pos53 pos54 pos55
```

Where the agent is at pos52, the stone is at pos42, and the goal is at pos34.
