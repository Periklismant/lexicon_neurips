Okay, let's see. I need to figure out a plan to move stone1 to a goal location, which is pos34 according to the initial state. The initial positions are: the agent (player1) is at pos52, and stone1 is at pos42. The goal is pos34. So the stone needs to get from pos42 to pos34. 

First, I should check the movement paths. The agent starts at pos52. To reach the stone at pos42, the agent can move left to pos52 to pos42? Wait, looking at the movement directions: from pos52, according to the initial state's movement possibilities, pos52 can move to pos42 via dirleft, right? Because "You may move from location pos52 to location pos42 following direction dirleft". Wait, wait, the movement directions are listed as "You may move from location pos52 to location pos42 following direction dirleft". So yes, moving from pos52 to pos42 is possible with dirleft. But wait, the initial state says "stone1 is at location pos42", but also "Location pos42 is clear"? Wait, no. Wait the original state says "stone1 is at location pos42" and "Location pos42 is clear". Wait, that's a contradiction. Because if a stone is at pos42, then pos42 isn't clear. Wait, the original state says:

Looking back: The original state includes "stone1 is at location pos42" and "Location pos42 is clear". That's conflicting. Unless "clear" here means something else. Wait, maybe "clear" refers to the absence of the agent? Because the agent and stones can be on the same location? Or maybe the definition of "clear" is that a location is clear if there's no stone or agent. Hmm. Wait, the problem statement says: "Each position on the grid may contain either the agent, a stone or be empty." So a location can have either the agent, a stone, or be empty. Therefore, if a stone is at pos42, then that location is not clear. But according to the original state, "Location pos42 is clear". That seems like a contradiction. Wait, maybe the initial state's description is correct, and that stone1 is at pos42 but pos42 is considered clear. That can't be. So perhaps there's a mistake here. Wait, looking again: the original state includes:

"stone1 is at location pos42"

"Location pos42 is clear"

But if a stone is there, how can it be clear? That must be an error. Or maybe "clear" refers to the agent not being there. Wait, the problem statement says each location can contain either the agent, a stone, or be empty. So "clear" would mean that the agent is not there. Wait, but then the location could have a stone and be considered clear (since the agent is not present). Wait, the problem statement says "each position may contain either the agent, a stone or be empty". So "clear" in the context of the preconditions for actions probably refers to the agent not being there. For example, the move action requires that the target location is clear (i.e., the agent is not there). Because stones can be in locations where the agent can move, but if the agent is moving to a location, it must be clear (no agent there). But stones can be present. Wait, but the problem statement says that each position can have the agent, a stone, or be empty. So a location can have a stone and be considered clear for movement if the agent isn't there. So in the initial state, pos42 has stone1, but the agent is at pos52. So pos42 is not clear (since there's a stone there) but according to the original state, "Location pos42 is clear". Wait, that's conflicting. So perhaps the problem statement has an error here, or maybe "clear" refers to the agent's presence. Let me recheck the original state.

In the original state:

- "player1 is at location pos52"

- "stone1 is at location pos42"

Then in the list of locations that are clear, pos42 is in "Location pos42 is clear". But that's impossible if the stone is there. So this must be a mistake. Alternatively, maybe "clear" here refers to the agent not being present. So a location is clear if the agent is not there. But stones can be present. So in that case, pos42 is clear (since the agent is at pos52) even though the stone is there. So the preconditions for move actions require that the target location is clear (agent not present). So the stone's presence doesn't affect the clearness for movement. That makes sense. So in the initial state, pos42 has a stone but is considered clear for movement because the agent isn't there. So when the agent wants to move to pos42, can he? Because the preconditions for move are that the target location is clear (i.e., the agent isn't there), but the presence of a stone doesn't block movement. Wait, but according to the problem statement's description of the move action's preconditions: "(ii) location l_to is clear". So if a stone is at l_to, then l_to is not clear? Because it's occupied by a stone. But according to the original state, pos42 is clear even with the stone. Hmm. This is confusing. Let me check the problem statement again.

The problem statement says:

Each position on the grid may contain either the agent, a stone or be empty. Each position is flagged as either a goal position or a non-goal position.

So each location can have at most one of agent or stone or be empty.

Wait, but that's not possible. So maybe each location can have the agent, a stone, or nothing. So if a stone is at a location, then the agent can't be there. Therefore, "clear" in the move action's precondition (ii) "location l_to is clear" would mean that l_to has neither the agent nor a stone. Because otherwise, if l_to has a stone, then it's not clear. But according to the original state, pos42 is a location where the stone is, but it's marked as clear. That's a contradiction. So perhaps the problem statement's initial state has an error. Alternatively, perhaps "clear" is defined as not containing the agent. So a location can have a stone and be considered clear for the purpose of the move action. That would make sense. For example, when moving, the agent can move to a location with a stone, but that's not allowed. Because the move action's precondition (ii) says l_to must be clear. Therefore, if a stone is in l_to, then the move action can't be executed. Therefore, the initial state's "Location pos42 is clear" must be incorrect because there's a stone there. But according to the original state, the user says "stone1 is at location pos42" and "Location pos42 is clear". That must be an error. However, since the problem is given as such, perhaps I need to proceed under the assumption that "clear" refers to the absence of both agent and stones. So pos42 is not clear, but the original state says it's clear. That's conflicting. But perhaps in the problem's setup, there's a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the stone's presence doesn't affect the clearness. But that's not logical. 

Alternatively, perhaps the way the initial state is presented is that "Location pos42 is clear" refers to the agent not being there. So "clear" in the context of the initial state's description refers to the agent's absence, and stones are separate. So when the agent is not present, the location is considered clear for movement. Then, the stone's presence would not affect whether a location is clear. But that would mean that the agent can move to a location with a stone, which contradicts the move action's preconditions. Because the move action's precondition (ii) says "location l_to is clear", which, in this interpretation, would mean that the agent is not at l_to, but stones can be there. But then, the agent could move to a location with a stone, which would cause the agent and stone to occupy the same position. But the problem statement says each position can contain either the agent, a stone, or be empty. Therefore, this is impossible. Therefore, the correct interpretation must be that a location is clear if it is empty (no agent, no stone). Therefore, the initial state's assertion that pos42 is clear is incorrect if there's a stone there. Therefore, this must be an error in the problem statement. However, given that the problem is presented this way, perhaps I have to work with it. Maybe the original state has a typo, and the stone is at pos42 but pos42 is not clear, but the user wrote that it is. Alternatively, maybe the stone is not at pos42. Let me check again.

Wait, the original state says:

"stone1 is at location pos42"

"Location pos42 is clear"

This is impossible if "clear" means the location is empty. Therefore, perhaps there's a mistake here. Alternatively, perhaps "Location posX is clear" in the initial state refers to the agent not being there, and stones are allowed. So "clear" in the initial state's context is about the agent's presence. So the agent can move to a location with a stone, but then that would mean that the move action's precondition (ii) is satisfied if the agent isn't there, even if a stone is. But when the agent moves to l_to, he would be in the same position as the stone, which is not allowed according to the problem statement. Therefore, the correct interpretation must be that a location is clear if it has neither agent nor stone. Therefore, the initial state's description is conflicting. However, since the user provided this, maybe we have to proceed under the assumption that pos42 has the stone but is considered clear (which is a mistake) or that there's a typo in the problem. Alternatively, perhaps the stone is at pos43 and the initial state has a typo. But the user says "stone1 is at location pos42".

Hmm. This is a problem. But perhaps I should proceed. Let's assume that the stone is at pos42, and the location pos42 is not clear (since the stone is there). Therefore, the initial state's line "Location pos42 is clear" is a mistake. But how can I proceed? Well, perhaps the user intended that the stone is at pos42, and the agent needs to push it. Let's proceed with that.

So the stone is at pos42, and the goal is to get it to a goal location. The only goal location is pos34. So the stone needs to be moved from pos42 to pos34. Let's look at the movement paths.

Looking at the allowed movements:

From pos42, the movement options are:

- You may move from location pos42 to location pos32 following direction dirleft.

- You may move from location pos42 to location pos52 following direction dirright.

- You may move from location pos42 to location pos41 following direction dirup.

- You may move from location pos42 to location pos43 following direction dirdown.

But wait, the agent is at pos52. So first, the agent needs to reach pos42 to push the stone. But pos42 has the stone. Wait, but the agent can't be in the same location as the stone. So the agent needs to get adjacent to pos42 to push it. Wait, no. The push actions require that the agent is at a location adjacent to the stone. For example, to push the stone from pos42 to pos32 (direction dirleft), the agent must be at pos42's right (dirleft implies pushing left, so agent is to the right of the stone). Wait, the direction is from the agent's perspective. Wait, the "pushtogoal" action has the agent at l_p, pushing the stone from l_from to l_to following direction d. So the agent is at l_p, which must be adjacent to l_from in direction d. For example, if the agent is to the right of the stone (l_p is pos43, l_from is pos42), then direction dirleft would allow pushing the stone to pos42 to pos41 (but that's not correct). Wait, maybe I need to clarify the directions.

Let me look at the movement directions. For example, "You may move from location pos42 to location pos32 following direction dirleft." So moving from pos42 to pos32 is dirleft. So direction dirleft means moving left in the grid. Similarly, dirright is right, dirup is up, dirdown is down. So the grid is arranged with rows and columns. For example, pos11 is row 1, column 1; pos12 is row 1, column 2; pos21 is row 2, column 1, etc. So moving dirleft from pos42 (row 4, column 2) would take you to pos41 (row 4, column 1). Wait, no, pos42 is row 4, column 2. So moving left (dirleft) would decrease the column by 1, leading to pos41. But according to the movement list, moving from pos42 to pos32 is dirleft. Wait, that's confusing. Wait, looking at the movement directions provided:

Looking at the given movement for pos42:

"You may move from location pos42 to location pos32 following direction dirleft"

Wait, pos42 to pos32 is moving up (row 4 to row 3), but the direction is dirleft. That's inconsistent. So perhaps the directions are not based on grid movement but on some other orientation. Alternatively, perhaps the directions are relative. Maybe the movement directions are such that dirleft means moving in the left direction in the grid, which would correspond to decreasing the column number, but that doesn't align with the example given. For example, moving from pos42 to pos32 is dirleft. Pos42 is (4,2), pos32 is (3,2). So moving from (4,2) to (3,2) is up, but the direction is dirleft. That doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the directions are named based on the direction you face when moving. For example, moving from pos42 to pos32 (up) might require facing dirup, but according to the movement list, it's dirleft. So this seems conflicting. Therefore, perhaps the directions are not cardinal directions but are relative. Alternatively, there might be an error in the problem statement. Given that, perhaps I need to rely on the movement directions as provided.

So, according to the problem statement, the movement from pos42 to pos32 is dirleft. Similarly, movement from pos42 to pos52 is dirright. So pos42 is connected to pos32 (up) via dirleft, pos52 (down) via dirright, pos41 (left) via dirup, and pos43 (right) via dirdown. This is a bit confusing, but perhaps the directions are mapped differently. For example, dirleft could correspond to moving north, dirright to south, dirup to west, and dirdown to east. But this is speculation. Alternatively, maybe the directions are named based on the direction you move from the current position. For example, moving dirleft from pos42 would take you to the left neighbor. But according to the movement list, moving dirleft from pos42 takes you to pos32, which is up. So this suggests that the directions are not aligned with the grid's left/right/up/down. Therefore, perhaps the directions are arbitrary labels, and we have to use the given movement possibilities as per the problem's specifications.

Given that, to move from pos42 to pos32, the direction is dirleft. Similarly, from pos42 to pos52 is dirright. So for pushing the stone, the agent needs to be at a location adjacent to the stone's current position, in a direction that allows pushing. For example, to push the stone from pos42 to pos32 (dirleft), the agent must be at pos42's dirleft neighbor's opposite direction. Wait, no. The preconditions for pushtogoal are:

(iv) you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d.

(v) you can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d.

So l_p is the agent's location. So for example, if the agent is at l_p, then moving in direction d from l_p would reach l_from. Then, moving in direction d from l_from would reach l_to. So direction d is the same for both. So if the agent is at l_p, then l_from is the next location in direction d from l_p. Then, l_to is the next location in direction d from l_from. So the agent pushes the stone from l_from to l_to, which is two steps in direction d. Wait, no: the agent is at l_p, moves to l_from (but that's part of the effect?), or is it that the agent is at l_p, and l_from is adjacent in direction d. So for the pushtogoal action, the agent is at l_p, which is adjacent to l_from in direction d, and l_from is adjacent to l_to in direction d. Therefore, the stone moves from l_from to l_to (one step in direction d), and the agent moves from l_p to l_from (one step in direction d). So the direction is the same for both movements. Therefore, to push a stone from l_from to l_to in direction d, the agent must be at l_p, which is one step in the opposite direction from l_from. For example, if the agent is west of the stone (l_p is west of l_from), and direction d is east, then pushing the stone east would move it to l_to (east of l_from), and the agent moves east into l_from. But perhaps I'm getting this mixed up.

Let's take an example. Suppose the stone is at pos42. The agent wants to push it to pos32 (dirleft). For that, the agent must be at a location l_p such that moving from l_p to l_from (pos42) via direction dirleft. According to the movement list, which locations can move to pos42 via dirleft? Looking at the movement directions:

Looking for "You may move from location X to pos42 following direction dirleft".

Looking at the movement list:

- "You may move from location pos32 to location pos42 following direction dirright". So dirright from pos32 takes you to pos42. So if direction is dirright, then from pos32 to pos42. So to push the stone from pos42 to pos32 via dirleft, the agent needs to be at pos32, and the direction would be dirright. Wait, no. The action is "pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d". So l_p is the agent's current location. The precondition is that you can move from l_p to l_from via direction d. Then, from l_from to l_to via direction d. So if the stone is at l_from (pos42), and the agent is at l_p (pos32), then direction d must be dirright (since moving from pos32 to pos42 is dirright). Then, moving from pos42 in direction dirright would be to pos43? Wait, according to the movement list, moving from pos42 in direction dirright is to pos52. Wait, no: "You may move from location pos42 to location pos52 following direction dirright". So if the agent is at pos32 and uses direction dirright, he can reach pos42 (stone's current position). Then, from pos42, moving dirright takes you to pos52. But we want to push the stone to pos32. Hmm, this is getting confusing.

Wait, let's think again. The stone is at pos42. The goal is to push it to pos34, which is a goal location. The path from pos42 to pos34 would require moving the stone up (dirleft to pos32?), then left again (dirleft to pos22?), etc. Wait, pos34 is in row 3, column4. So pos42 is row4, column2. So to get from pos42 to pos34, the stone needs to move up (from row4 to row3) and right (from column2 to column4). So possible path: pos42 → pos32 (up via dirleft), then pos32 → pos33 (right?), but pos33 is not a goal. Then pos33 → pos34 (right?), but pos34 is the goal. But how to get there.

Alternatively, the stone could be pushed from pos42 to pos43 (dirdown?), then pos43 to pos44 (dirdown?), then pos44 to pos34 (dirleft). Because pos44 is in row4, column4, and moving dirleft from there would take you to pos34 (row3, column4?), but according to the movement directions:

Looking at the movement from pos44: "You may move from location pos44 to location pos34 following direction dirleft". So yes. So pushing the stone from pos44 to pos34 (dirleft) would achieve the goal. So the path would be pos42 → pos43 → pos44 → pos34. Each push requires the agent to be in the correct position.

But first, the agent needs to get to the stone's location. The agent starts at pos52. To reach pos42, he can move left (dirleft) from pos52 to pos42. Wait, according to the movement list, "You may move from location pos52 to location pos42 following direction dirleft". So yes. So the agent can move from pos52 to pos42 via dirleft. But wait, the stone is at pos42. So moving there would require that pos42 is clear. But pos42 has the stone, so it's not clear. Therefore, the agent cannot move to pos42. Therefore, the agent needs to approach the stone from an adjacent position to push it.

Wait, the stone is at pos42. So to push it, the agent must be at a location adjacent to pos42. The adjacent locations according to the movement list are pos32 (dirleft), pos52 (dirright), pos41 (dirup), pos43 (dirdown). So the agent needs to be at one of these positions to push the stone.

But initially, the agent is at pos52. From pos52, he can move to pos42 (dirleft), but that's blocked by the stone. Wait, no. The move action's precondition is that the target location is clear (no agent or stone). Since the stone is at pos42, pos42 is not clear, so the agent can't move there. Therefore, the agent must move around to an adjacent position of pos42 to push the stone.

So the agent starts at pos52. Possible moves:

From pos52, possible movements:

- To pos42 (dirleft), but blocked by stone.

- To pos51 (dirup) via "You may move from location pos52 to location pos51 following direction dirup".

Wait, no. The movement list says: "You may move from location pos52 to location pos42 following direction dirleft", "You may move from location pos52 to location pos51 following direction dirup" (is that correct?) Let me check:

Looking at the movement directions for pos52:

"You may move from location pos52 to location pos42 following direction dirleft"

"You may move from location pos52 to location pos51 following direction dirup"

"You may move from location pos52 to location pos53 following direction dirdown"

So yes. So the agent can move from pos52 to pos51 (dirup), pos53 (dirdown), or pos42 (dirleft, but blocked).

So the agent can move to pos51 or pos53 first.

But pos51 is clear (according to initial state), so the agent can move there. Then, from pos51, where can he go?

From pos51: "You may move from location pos51 to location pos41 following direction dirleft" and "You may move from location pos51 to location pos52 following direction dirdown".

So moving to pos41 (dirleft) from pos51. Then, from pos41, can he move to pos42 (dirdown)? According to movement list for pos41: "You may move from location pos41 to location pos31 following direction dirleft", "You may move from location pos41 to location pos51 following direction dirright", "You may move from location pos41 to location pos42 following direction dirdown".

So yes, from pos41, the agent can move dirdown to pos42. But pos42 has the stone, so that's blocked. So the agent can't move directly to pos42. Therefore, the agent needs to reach a position adjacent to pos42 to push the stone.

Alternatively, the agent could move from pos52 to pos53 (dirdown). Then from pos53, he can move to pos43 (dirleft) or pos54 (dirdown), etc. Let's see. From pos53: "You may move from location pos53 to location pos43 following direction dirleft", "You may move from location pos53 to location pos52 following direction dirup", "You may move from location pos53 to location pos54 following direction dirdown".

So moving to pos43 (dirleft) from pos53. pos43 is clear according to the initial state. So agent moves to pos53, then to pos43. Now, agent is at pos43, which is adjacent to pos42 (since from pos43, moving dirup leads to pos42. Wait, looking at the movement list for pos43: "You may move from location pos43 to location pos33 following direction dirleft", "You may move from location pos43 to location pos53 following direction dirright", "You may move from location pos43 to location pos42 following direction dirup", "You may move from location pos43 to location pos44 following direction dirdown".

So from pos43, the agent can move dirup to pos42 (but it's blocked by the stone), or dirdown to pos44, etc. Wait, pos42 has the stone, so moving there is blocked. But the agent can push the stone from pos43. Wait, the agent is at pos43. To push the stone at pos42, the agent needs to be at a location l_p such that from l_p, moving in direction d takes him to pos42 (l_from). So if the agent is at pos43, and direction d is dirup (since moving dirup from pos43 takes him to pos42), then he can push the stone from pos42 to pos32 (if direction is dirup? Or perhaps direction is dirleft. Wait, no. The direction for pushing must be the same as the direction from l_p to l_from, and then from l_from to l_to. So if the agent is at pos43, and direction is dirup to reach pos42 (l_from), then the next direction from pos42 (d) would be dirup to reach pos32. But according to the movement list, moving from pos42 in direction dirup takes you to pos41. Wait, no:

Movement from pos42:

"You may move from location pos42 to location pos32 following direction dirleft"

"You may move from location pos42 to location pos52 following direction dirright"

"You may move from location pos42 to location pos41 following direction dirup"

"You may move from location pos42 to location pos43 following direction dirdown"

So, from pos42, direction dirup leads to pos41. Direction dirleft leads to pos32. So if the agent is at pos43 (south of pos42), then to push the stone north, he would need to move up (dirup) from pos43 to pos42 (l_from), and then the stone moves dirup from pos42 to pos41. But pos41 is not a goal location, so that's not helpful. Alternatively, if the agent is at pos32 (north of pos42), then he could push the stone south (dirdown) to pos43. But pos43 is not a goal. Hmm.

Alternatively, the agent could push the stone from pos42 to pos32 (dirleft). To do that, the agent must be at a location from which he can move dirleft to pos42. According to the movement list, moving dirleft to pos42 would require being at pos43. Because from pos43, moving dirleft (west) would take you to pos33? Wait, no. Let me check: movement from pos43 to pos33 is dirleft. So pos43 is (4,3), pos33 is (3,3). So dirleft from pos43 is west to pos33. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, the movement directions seem to have different mappings. For example, moving dirleft from pos42 takes you to pos32, which is north. So perhaps dirleft corresponds to north, dirright to south, dirup to west, and dirdown to east. This is a possible mapping, but it's not standard. Therefore, it's crucial to follow the given movement directions as per the problem statement.

Given the confusion, perhaps I should approach this step by step.

The agent needs to push stone1 from pos42 to pos34. Let's find a path from pos42 to pos34 using the allowed movements.

Possible paths:

pos42 → pos43 → pos44 → pos34 (since pos44 can move to pos34 via dirleft).

But how to push the stone along this path.

First, the agent needs to get to pos43 to push the stone to pos43. Then, from pos43 to pos44, and so on.

But initially, the stone is at pos42. Let's see:

Step 1: Agent moves from pos52 to pos53 (dirdown), since pos53 is clear.

Step 2: Agent moves from pos53 to pos43 (dirleft), since pos43 is clear.

Now, agent is at pos43, adjacent to pos42 (stone's location). From here, the agent can push the stone to pos43's direction. Wait, to push the stone from pos42 to pos43, the agent must be at a location from which he can move in direction d to pos42. For example, if the agent is at pos43, he can move to pos42 via dirdown? No. Looking at the movement list for pos43:

From pos43, you can move to pos33 (dirleft), pos53 (dirright), pos42 (dirup), pos44 (dirdown). So direction dirup from pos43 takes you to pos42.

So, to push the stone from pos42 to pos43 (south), the agent would need to be north of pos42 (pos32), and push it south. Wait, no. Let's think about the push action.

To push the stone from pos42 to pos43 (south), the agent needs to be at pos42's north position (pos32), and push south. Because the direction d would be dirdown. From pos32, moving dirdown to pos42, then pos42 to pos43. Wait, no. The direction must be the same for both steps. So if the agent is at pos32, and direction is dirdown, moving from pos32 to pos42 (dirdown), then from pos42 to pos52 (dirdown). But that's not helpful. Alternatively, if the agent is at pos43 and direction is dirup, then moving from pos43 to pos42 (dirup), then from pos42 to pos41 (dirup). But that's pushing the stone north to pos41, which is not a goal.

Alternatively, to push the stone east to pos43, the agent needs to be west of pos42 (pos41), and direction is dirright. From pos41, moving dirright to pos42, then dirright to pos43. So the direction would be dirright. So the agent is at pos41, moves dirright to pos42 (pushing the stone to pos43). But pos41 is clear initially. So the agent could move to pos41, then push the stone east.

But how to get to pos41 from pos52.

Path from pos52 to pos41:

pos52 → pos51 (dirup), then pos51 → pos41 (dirleft).

Yes. So:

1. move player1 pos52 pos51 dirup

2. move player1 pos51 pos41 dirleft

Now, agent is at pos41. From here, he can push the stone east (dirright) to pos42 → pos43.

Wait, no. To push the stone from pos42 to pos43 (east), the agent needs to be west of pos42 (pos41), and direction dirright. So:

pushtonongoal (since pos43 is not a goal) player1 stone1 pos41 pos42 pos43 dirright

This action's preconditions:

(i) agent is at pos41: yes.

(ii) stone1 is at pos42: yes.

(iii) pos43 is clear: initially, yes.

(iv) can move from pos41 to pos42 via dirright: according to the movement list, from pos41, moving dirdown takes you to pos42. So direction d must be dirdown. Because "You may move from location pos41 to location pos42 following direction dirdown".

So the direction for pushing would be dirdown. Wait, this is getting complicated. Let's re-examine.

The action is "pushtonongoal p s l_p l_from l_to d".

Preconditions:

(iv) you can get from l_p to l_from following direction d.

(v) you can get from l_from to l_to following direction d.

So in this case, l_p is pos41, l_from is pos42, l_to is pos43. So direction d must be such that from pos41, moving d takes you to pos42, and from pos42, moving d takes you to pos43.

Looking at the movement list for pos41:

From pos41, you can move to pos31 (dirleft), pos51 (dirright), pos42 (dirdown).

So direction d for (iv) is dirdown. Then, from pos42, moving dirdown takes you to pos43. So yes.

Therefore, the action would be:

pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos41 pos42 pos43 dirdown

This is valid. After this action, the stone moves from pos42 to pos43, and the agent moves from pos41 to pos42.

But pos43 is not a goal location, so this is a pushtonongoal action.

Now, the stone is at pos43. Next, we need to push it to pos44, then to pos34.

To push from pos43 to pos44 (dirdown), the agent must be at pos33 (dirleft?), no. Let's see.

The agent is now at pos42 after the previous push. From there, he can move to pos43 (dirdown), but pos43 now has the stone. Wait, after the push, the agent is at pos42 (since the pushtonongoal action's effect is (iv) agent moves to l_from (pos42)). So after pushing, the agent is at pos42. But pos42 is now clear because the stone moved to pos43. Wait, no: the effect of pushtonongoal is (ii) stone is no longer at l_from (pos42), (v) stone is at l_to (pos43). So pos42 is now clear (no stone, agent is there). So agent is at pos42. Then, to push the stone from pos43 to pos44, the agent needs to be at a location adjacent to pos43 in direction d, such that moving from l_p (agent's location) to pos43 (l_from) via direction d, and then from pos43 to pos44 via direction d.

The agent is currently at pos42. From pos42, moving dirdown takes him to pos43. So direction d is dirdown. Then, from pos43, moving dirdown takes to pos44. So the agent can perform:

pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos43 pos44 dirdown

Preconditions check:

(i) agent is at pos42: yes.

(ii) stone is at pos43: yes.

(iii) pos44 is clear: initially yes.

(iv) can move from pos42 to pos43 via dirdown: according to movement list, pos42 can move to pos43 via dirdown: "You may move from location pos42 to location pos43 following direction dirdown".

(v) can move from pos43 to pos44 via dirdown: yes, "You may move from location pos43 to location pos44 following direction dirdown".

(vi) pos44 is not a goal: correct, since pos44 is not a goal.

So this action is valid. After this, the stone is at pos44, and the agent is at pos43.

Now, the stone is at pos44. The next step is to push it to pos34, which is a goal location. So the action would be pushtogoal.

To push from pos44 to pos34 (dirleft), the agent needs to be at a location l_p such that moving from l_p to pos44 via direction dirleft. Let's see. From pos44, moving dirleft takes you to pos34. So direction dirleft. So the agent must be at a location where moving dirleft takes him to pos44. Looking at the movement list:

Looking for "You may move from location X to pos44 following direction dirleft".

From pos34: "You may move from location pos34 to location pos44 following direction dirright". So direction dirright from pos34 to pos44. So to get to pos44 via dirleft, the agent would need to be at pos45. For example, from pos45, moving dirleft to pos44. But pos45 is clear. Alternatively, from pos54, moving dirup to pos44? Wait, pos54's movements: "You may move from location pos54 to location pos44 following direction dirleft", "You may move from location pos54 to location pos53 following direction dirup", "You may move from location pos54 to location pos55 following direction dirdown".

So from pos54, moving dirleft takes you to pos44. So if the agent is at pos54, he can push the stone from pos44 to pos34 via dirleft. But currently, the agent is at pos43 after pushing to pos44. So how to get to pos54?

Alternatively, after the stone is at pos44, the agent is at pos43. To push the stone from pos44 to pos34 (dirleft), the agent needs to be at pos44's right side (dirleft from the agent's perspective). Wait, no. Let's think again.

The agent needs to be at a location l_p such that moving in direction d from l_p reaches pos44 (l_from), and moving in direction d from pos44 reaches pos34 (l_to). The direction d here must be dirleft because pos44 to pos34 is dirleft. So the agent must be at a location that, when moving dirleft, reaches pos44. Looking at the movement list, which locations can move to pos44 via dirleft?

From pos54: "You may move from location pos54 to location pos44 following direction dirleft".

So the agent needs to be at pos54. But currently, the agent is at pos43. So he needs to move from pos43 to pos53, then to pos54.

Path:

From pos43:

- move to pos53 (dirright).

Then from pos53 to pos54 (dirdown).

Then from pos54, push the stone from pos44 to pos34.

But wait, the stone is at pos44, which is adjacent to pos54 (dirleft). So agent at pos54 can push the stone from pos44 to pos34 (dirleft). But first, the agent needs to reach pos54.

Steps:

After pushing the stone to pos44, the agent is at pos43.

1. move player1 pos43 pos53 dirright.

2. move player1 pos53 pos54 dirdown.

Now, agent is at pos54. Then:

3. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos54 pos44 pos34 dirleft.

Check preconditions:

(i) agent at pos54: yes.

(ii) stone at pos44: yes.

(iii) pos34 is clear: initially, yes, since pos34 is a goal location and initially clear. But after previous actions, pos34 is still clear.

(iv) can move from pos54 to pos44 via dirleft: yes.

(v) can move from pos44 to pos34 via dirleft: yes.

(vi) pos34 is a goal location: yes.

This action is valid. After this, the stone is at pos34 (goal), and the agent moves to pos44.

Now, the stone is at a goal location, so the task is complete.

But wait, the constraints require that:

"The following expression must hold in at least one state: "Location pos34 is not clear""

And 

"If "Location pos34 is not clear" holds in some state s, then "Location pos14 is not clear" must hold at s or at some state after s".

In our current plan, pos34 is made not clear when the stone is pushed there. Then, we need to ensure that pos14 is not clear either at that state or after. But pos14 is a non-goal location, and in the initial state, pos14 is clear. How to make pos14 not clear?

This constraint complicates the plan. So the plan must include a state where pos34 is not clear (which happens when the stone is there), and then ensure that either at the same time or later, pos14 is not clear.

But pos14 is initially clear. So the agent or a stone must be at pos14 at some point. Since there's only one stone (stone1), which is now at pos34, the only way to make pos14 not clear is to have the agent move there. But why would the agent need to go there? Unless there's a requirement to push another stone, but there's only one stone. So maybe the agent has to move to pos14 after pushing the stone to pos34. But that's not necessary for the goal. However, the constraint requires that if pos34 is not clear in any state, then pos14 must not be clear in that state or a subsequent one. So our current plan makes pos34 not clear in the final state (stone is there). Therefore, we must ensure that pos14 is not clear either at the same time (which it's not, since the stone is at pos34) or after. So after pushing the stone to pos34, the agent must move to pos14, making it not clear.

But the goal is only that the stone is at a goal location. So after achieving that, the agent can move to pos14 to satisfy the constraint.

So the final steps would be:

After step 3 (pushtogoal to pos34):

4. move player1 pos44 pos34 dirleft.

But pos34 is now occupied by the stone. So moving there is blocked. So the agent is at pos44. From pos44, he can move to pos34 (dirleft), but it's occupied by the stone. So he can't. Alternative paths:

From pos44, the agent can move to pos34 (dirleft) but it's blocked, pos43 (dirup), pos54 (dirright), or pos45 (dirdown).

Alternatively, the agent could move from pos44 to pos43 (dirup), then to pos33, etc., eventually reaching pos14. But this would take many steps. Let's see.

But the constraint requires that after pos34 is not clear (which is after step 3), pos14 must be not clear at that state or later. So the agent needs to reach pos14 after step 3.

But how? Let's think of the minimal steps to achieve this.

After step 3, the agent is at pos44. From there:

4. move player1 pos44 pos43 dirup.

5. move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft.

6. move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft.

7. move player1 pos23 pos13 dirleft.

8. move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown.

At step 8, the agent moves to pos14, making it not clear. This satisfies the constraint, as pos14 is not clear after step 8. However, this adds several steps, making the plan longer. But the problem requires an optimal plan (shortest possible). Therefore, we need to find a way to satisfy the constraints with minimal steps.

Alternatively, perhaps during the plan, pos14 is already made not clear. But how?

In the initial plan, after pushing the stone to pos34, the agent is at pos44. To make pos14 not clear, the agent must move there. But this requires multiple steps. Alternatively, maybe during the earlier steps, the agent can pass through pos14. But pos14 is far from the initial positions. Let's see:

pos14 is in row1, column4. The agent starts at pos52 (row5, column2). The stone is at pos42 (row4, column2). The path to push the stone is towards pos34 (row3, column4). To reach pos14, the agent would have to move up through several rows and columns. It's unlikely that this can be done in a way that minimizes the plan length.

Alternatively, perhaps during the plan, when pushing the stone to pos34, pos14 can be made not clear by another action. But there's only one stone. So the only way is for the agent to be at pos14 at some point after pos34 is not clear.

But this requires additional steps. However, the problem states that the constraints must be satisfied. Therefore, the plan must include these steps. But how to make this optimal.

Wait, the constraint says that in at least one state, pos34 is not clear. That happens when the stone is there. Then, if pos34 is not clear in state s (which is after step 3), then in s or some state after, pos14 must not be clear. So the agent can move to pos14 after step 3, making pos14 not clear. This adds steps but is necessary.

So the optimal plan would be:

1. move player1 pos52 pos53 dirdown

2. move player1 pos53 pos43 dirleft

3. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos42 pos43 dirup

Wait, no. Earlier plan steps need to be adjusted. Let's reevaluate.

Alternative approach:

Maybe there's a shorter path that satisfies the constraints. Let's think again.

Original plan steps (without considering constraints):

1. move player1 pos52 pos53 dirdown

2. move player1 pos53 pos43 dirleft

3. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos42 pos43 dirup (but this is invalid because after pushing, the stone moves to pos43, which is not a goal. Then, push to pos44, then to pos34. Then, agent must go to pos14.

But this requires several steps. However, the constraints require that when pos34 is not clear (after pushing the stone there), pos14 must be not clear at that state or after. So after step of pushing to pos34, the agent can move towards pos14.

But the problem requires an optimal plan, so we need to find the shortest possible.

Alternative idea: Can the agent move to pos14 before pushing the stone to pos34, thus making pos14 not clear before pos34 is not clear? But then the constraint would not be triggered because pos34 is clear at that time. The constraint says that if pos34 is not clear in some state, then pos14 must be not clear in that state or after. So if the agent moves to pos14 before making pos34 not clear, then when pos34 becomes not clear (after pushing the stone there), pos14 was already not clear in a previous state. But the constraint requires that pos14 is not clear in s or after. So if pos14 was not clear before s, that's acceptable. Because the constraint says "must hold at s or at some state after s". So if pos14 was not clear in a state before s, that's allowed. Wait, no. Because the constraint is an implication: if in state s, pos34 is not clear, then pos14 must be not clear in s or in some state after s. So the agent can have visited pos14 before s, making pos14 not clear in a state before s. But if in state s, pos14 is clear again (because the agent left), then the constraint is violated. Therefore, to satisfy the constraint, either pos14 is not clear in state s (when pos34 is not clear) or in any state after s. So the safest way is to have pos14 not clear at the same time or after pos34 is not clear.

Therefore, one way to satisfy the constraint is to have the agent move to pos14 after pushing the stone to pos34. This way, when pos34 is not clear (in the final state), pos14 is not clear (agent is there) in a subsequent state.

But the goal is achieved when the stone is at a goal location, which is pos34. So once the stone is there, the goal is satisfied, but the agent must still ensure the constraints. However, the problem requires that the plan brings about the goal situation while satisfying all constraints. So the constraints must hold in the plan's execution, not just in the final state. Therefore, the plan must include actions that ensure that after pos34 becomes not clear, pos14 is not clear at some point.

So the steps would be:

Push the stone to pos34, then move the agent to pos14.

But how to do that efficiently.

After pushing the stone to pos34 (step 3), agent is at pos44. Then:

4. move player1 pos44 pos34 dirleft → but pos34 is occupied by the stone, so this is invalid.

Alternative path from pos44:

4. move player1 pos44 pos43 dirup

5. move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft

6. move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft

7. move player1 pos23 pos13 dirleft

8. move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown

Now, pos14 is not clear (agent there). This satisfies the constraint, as after pos34 is not clear (step 3), pos14 becomes not clear in step 8. But this adds five more actions. This makes the plan length 8 actions. But perhaps there's a shorter way.

Alternative idea: Can the agent reach pos14 earlier in the plan, thus satisfying the constraint without adding too many steps?

For example, after pushing the stone to pos44 (step 3), the agent is at pos43. Then, instead of pushing to pos34, first move to pos14, then push the stone.

But that would not make sense because the stone is at pos44, and pushing it to pos34 is necessary. Alternatively, this approach would complicate the plan.

Alternatively, after pushing the stone to pos44, the agent goes to pos14, then comes back to push to pos34. But this would increase the plan length.

Hmm. This is challenging.

Wait, the constraint requires that whenever pos34 is not clear in a state, pos14 must be not clear in that state or after. So if pos34 is not clear in multiple states (like when the stone is pushed there and remains there), then for each such state, pos14 must be not clear in or after. But since the stone is only pushed to pos34 once, there's only one state where pos34 becomes not clear (the final state). Therefore, in that state or after, pos14 must be not clear.

But after the final state, there are no more actions, so the only way to satisfy it is if pos14 is not clear in the final state or in the state just before. But since the final state has the stone at pos34, the agent can be at pos14 in the final state, making pos14 not clear.

So the plan should end with the agent at pos14. But how to achieve that with minimal steps.

Final plan steps:

1. move player1 pos52 pos53 dirdown

2. move player1 pos53 pos43 dirleft

3. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos42 pos43 dirup → stone at pos43

4. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos43 pos44 dirdown → stone at pos44

5. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos44 pos34 dirleft → stone at pos34 (goal achieved)

6. move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft → invalid because pos34 has stone, so agent can't move there. So from pos44, agent is at pos34's previous location (after push to pos34, agent is at pos44. Wait, no. Let's recheck the effects of pushtogoal:

After performing pushtogoal, the agent moves from l_p (pos44) to l_from (pos44?) Wait, no. The pushtogoal action's parameters are (p, s, l_p, l_from, l_to, d). The agent is at l_p. The stone is at l_from. So in step 5, the action is:

pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos54 pos44 pos34 dirleft → but earlier steps need correction.

Wait, previous steps had the stone at pos44, agent at pos44. Wait, let me re-examine the correct steps.

After step 4: stone is at pos44, agent is at pos43.

Then, to push to pos34, the agent needs to be at pos54, as previously planned. So:

5. move player1 pos43 pos53 dirright

6. move player1 pos53 pos54 dirdown

7. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos54 pos44 pos34 dirleft → stone at pos34, agent at pos44.

Now, after step 7, agent is at pos44. To reach pos14:

8. move player1 pos44 pos34 dirleft → invalid (stone is there)

9. move player1 pos44 pos43 dirup

10. move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft

11. move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft

12. move player1 pos23 pos13 dirleft

13. move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown → now pos14 is not clear.

This makes the plan 13 steps, which is very long. But the problem requires an optimal plan. This suggests that there's a more efficient way to satisfy the constraints.

Alternative approach: Maybe the constraint can be satisfied earlier in the plan. For example, during the pushing steps, the agent could move through pos14 before pushing the stone to pos34. But how?

Alternatively, maybe the agent can push the stone to pos34, then immediately move to pos14 in fewer steps.

After step 7 (agent at pos44):

8. move player1 pos44 pos34 dirleft → invalid

So need to find another path. From pos44:

8. move player1 pos44 pos43 dirup

9. move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft

10. move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft

11. move player1 pos23 pos13 dirleft

12. move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown

This is 5 moves from pos44. So total steps: 7 (pushes) +5 (moves) = 12 steps. Still long.

Wait, but the constraint requires that pos14 is not clear in or after the state where pos34 is not clear. If the agent moves to pos14 before pushing the stone to pos34, then pos14 is not clear in a state before pos34 is not clear. But the constraint says that if pos34 is not clear in a state s, then pos14 must be not clear in s or after. So if the agent was at pos14 before pushing the stone to pos34, but then leaves pos14, then in the state where pos34 is not clear, pos14 is clear again. That would violate the constraint. Therefore, the only safe way is to have the agent at pos14 either at the same time as the stone is at pos34 or after.

Thus, the agent must reach pos14 after the stone is at pos34. Therefore, the minimal plan would require pushing the stone to pos34 and then moving the agent to pos14. But this takes several steps.

But perhaps there's a smarter way. For example, after pushing the stone to pos34, the agent is at pos44. From there, can he move upwards through the grid to pos14?

From pos44, the movement options are:

- pos34 (dirleft)

- pos43 (dirup)

- pos54 (dirright)

- pos45 (dirdown)

So agent is at pos44. He needs to go north. Let's try:

8. move player1 pos44 pos43 dirup

9. move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft

10. move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft

11. move player1 pos23 pos13 dirleft

12. move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown

Steps 8-12: 5 steps to reach pos14.

Total steps: 7 (original) +5 = 12.

But this is not optimal. Is there a shorter path?

Alternative path from pos44 to pos14:

pos44 → pos34 (dirleft) → blocked by stone.

pos44 → pos43 (dirup) → pos43.

pos43 → pos33 (dirleft).

pos33 → pos23 (dirleft).

pos23 → pos13 (dirleft).

pos13 → pos14 (dirdown).

Same as before.

Another approach: perhaps use a different route. For example:

pos44 → pos43 (dirup).

pos43 → pos42 (dirup) → but pos42 is clear now (stone is at pos34).

pos42 → pos32 (dirleft).

pos32 → pos22 (dirleft).

pos22 → pos12 (dirleft).

pos12 → pos13 (dirdown).

pos13 → pos14 (dirdown).

This is 7 steps from pos44 to pos14. Longer.

So the shortest path from pos44 to pos14 is 5 steps. So total plan steps: 7 (original) +5 = 12. But the problem requires an optimal plan with minimal steps.

But maybe there's a way to satisfy the constraint without requiring the agent to move to pos14. For example, during the pushing process, pos14 is made not clear. But how? The only way is to have the agent or stone there. Since there's only one stone, and it's at pos34, the agent must be there. But how?

Wait, the constraint requires that in at least one state, pos34 is not clear. That happens when the stone is there. Then, the implication is that if pos34 is not clear in a state, then pos14 is not clear in that state or after. So if in the final state, pos34 is not clear (stone there), and pos14 is clear (agent not there), then the constraint is violated. Therefore, the agent must be at pos14 either in the final state or in a subsequent state. But once the stone is at pos34, the goal is achieved, but the plan must continue to ensure the constraint is met.

But the plan must bring about the goal situation (stone at goal) while satisfying all constraints. Therefore, the plan can end once the goal is achieved and the constraints are satisfied. So if the agent is at pos14 in the final state, that's acceptable. Therefore, the plan must end with the agent at pos14.

But how to get there with minimal steps.

Alternative plan:

After pushing the stone to pos34 (step 7), the agent is at pos44. Then:

8. move player1 pos44 pos43 dirup

9. move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft

10. move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft

11. move player1 pos23 pos13 dirleft

12. move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown

Total steps: 12. But this seems too long. Is there a shorter path?

Wait, after step 7 (agent at pos44), maybe the agent can move to pos14 via a different route. For example, pos44 → pos34 (dirleft) but it's blocked. pos44 → pos54 (dirright). pos54 → pos55 (dirdown). Not helpful. Alternatively, pos44 → pos45 (dirdown). pos45 → pos35 (dirleft). pos35 → pos25 (dirleft). etc. That's even longer.

Alternatively, from pos44, move to pos43 (dirup), then to pos42 (dirup). pos42 is clear (agent can move there). Then from pos42, move to pos32 (dirleft). pos32 → pos22 (dirleft). pos22 → pos12 (dirleft). pos12 → pos13 (dirdown). pos13 → pos14 (dirdown). That's 8 steps from pos44. Still longer.

It seems that the minimal steps to reach pos14 from pos44 is 5 steps. Therefore, the total plan length would be 12 steps. However, this is not optimal. Maybe there's a way to combine the pushing steps with moving to pos14 earlier.

Alternative idea: After pushing the stone to pos44, the agent can move towards pos14 before pushing to pos34. For example:

Original steps:

1. move player1 pos52 pos53 dirdown

2. move player1 pos53 pos43 dirleft

3. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos42 pos43 dirup → stone at pos43

4. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos43 pos44 dirdown → stone at pos44

Now, agent is at pos44. Instead of pushing to pos34 immediately, the agent moves to pos14, then returns to push the stone.

But this would require:

5. move player1 pos44 pos43 dirup

6. move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft

7. move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft

8. move player1 pos23 pos13 dirleft

9. move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown → pos14 not clear

10. move player1 pos14 pos13 dirup

11. move player1 pos13 pos23 dirdown

12. move player1 pos23 pos33 dirdown

13. move player1 pos33 pos43 dirdown

14. move player1 pos43 pos44 dirdown

15. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos44 pos34 dirleft → stone at pos34.

This is 15 steps, which is worse than before. So not optimal.

Thus, the initial plan of 12 steps seems necessary, but this is not optimal. However, perhaps there's a different approach to solve the problem that inherently satisfies the constraints.

Alternative approach: Push the stone to pos34 via a different path that allows the agent to reach pos14 more quickly. For example, pushing the stone up to pos32, then left to pos22, etc. But this would require more steps to reach pos34.

Alternatively, perhaps the agent can push the stone to pos34 in a way that the agent ends up near pos14.

But this seems unlikely. Let's consider another path for the stone:

pos42 → pos32 → pos22 → pos23 → pos24 → pos34. But this path requires more pushes and may not be optimal.

Alternatively, pos42 → pos43 → pos44 → pos34. Which is what we had earlier.

Given all this, it seems that the minimal plan length to satisfy the constraints is 12 steps. However, this is not optimal. Therefore, perhaps there's a misunderstanding of the constraints.

Re-examining the constraints:

The constraints are:

1. At least one state where pos34 is not clear.

2. If pos34 is not clear in any state s, then pos14 is not clear in s or after.

So the first constraint is satisfied when the stone is at pos34. The second requires that whenever pos34 is not clear, pos14 is not clear at that time or later. In our plan, after the stone is at pos34 (final state), pos14 must be not clear in that state or after. But in the final state, the agent is at pos14, making it not clear. So if the plan ends with the agent at pos14, then in the final state, pos34 is not clear (stone there) and pos14 is not clear (agent there), satisfying the constraint. Therefore, the plan can be:

Original pushing steps to pos34 (7 steps), then 5 steps to pos14, totaling 12 steps. But perhaps the agent can reach pos14 in fewer steps from pos44.

Wait, pos44 is in row4, column4. pos14 is row1, column4. So the agent needs to move up three times (from row4 to row1) in column4. Let's see:

From pos44, can the agent move up?

From pos44's movement options:

"You may move from location pos44 to location pos34 following direction dirleft"

"You may move from location pos44 to location pos54 following direction dirright"

"You may move from location pos44 to location pos43 following direction dirup"

"You may move from location pos44 to location pos45 following direction dirdown"

So from pos44, moving dirup takes the agent to pos43 (row4, column3). To reach pos14, the agent needs to move left and up.

Alternative path from pos44 to pos14:

1. pos44 → pos34 (dirleft) → blocked by stone.

2. pos44 → pos43 (dirup)

3. pos43 → pos33 (dirleft)

4. pos33 → pos23 (dirleft)

5. pos23 → pos13 (dirleft)

6. pos13 → pos14 (dirdown)

This is 6 steps from pos44. But that's the same as before.

But wait, maybe there's a faster way using other directions. For example:

From pos44 → pos43 (dirup)

From pos43 → pos33 (dirleft)

From pos33 → pos23 (dirleft)

From pos23 → pos13 (dirleft)

From pos13 → pos14 (dirdown)

This is 5 steps. So from pos44 to pos14 in 5 steps.

So total plan steps:

1. move pos52 to pos53 (dirdown)

2. move pos53 to pos43 (dirleft)

3. pushtonongoal pos43 to pos42 to pos43 (dirup)

4. pushtonongoal pos43 to pos43 to pos44 (dirdown)

5. move pos44 to pos43 (dirup)

6. move pos43 to pos33 (dirleft)

7. move pos33 to pos23 (dirleft)

8. move pos23 to pos13 (dirleft)

9. move pos13 to pos14 (dirdown)

10. pushtogoal pos14 to pos44 to pos34? No, the agent is at pos14 now, which is far from pos44. 

Wait, no. After step 9, the agent is at pos14. Then, he needs to go back to pos44 to push the stone to pos34. But that's not feasible. So the previous approach of pushing the stone to pos34 first, then moving to pos14 is the correct order.

Therefore, the correct plan is:

Steps 1-7: Push the stone to pos34.

Steps 8-12: Move agent to pos14.

Total steps: 12. But this is long. However, the problem requires an optimal plan. Given the constraints, perhaps this is the minimal possible. 

But wait, perhaps there's a way to satisfy the constraints with fewer steps. For example, after pushing the stone to pos34, the agent moves to pos44 and then to pos34 (but it's blocked). No. Alternative idea: After pushing the stone to pos34, the agent moves to pos14 in fewer steps. But how?

Alternatively, maybe the agent can reach pos14 during the pushing process. For example, after pushing the stone to pos44, the agent moves towards pos14 before pushing to pos34.

For example:

1. move player1 pos52 pos53 dirdown

2. move player1 pos53 pos43 dirleft

3. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos42 pos43 dirup → stone at pos43

4. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos43 pos44 dirdown → stone at pos44

5. move player1 pos44 pos43 dirup

6. move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft

7. move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft

8. move player1 pos23 pos13 dirleft

9. move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown → pos14 not clear

Now, pos14 is not clear. Then, the agent needs to return to pos44 to push the stone to pos34.

10. move player1 pos14 pos13 dirup

11. move player1 pos13 pos23 dirdown

12. move player1 pos23 pos33 dirdown

13. move player1 pos33 pos43 dirdown

14. move player1 pos43 pos44 dirdown

15. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos44 pos34 dirleft → stone at pos34

Now, in state 15, pos34 is not clear (stone there), and in state 9, pos14 was not clear. Since state 15 is after state 9, the constraint is satisfied because pos14 was not clear in state 9, which is before state 15. But the constraint says that if pos34 is not clear in state s, then pos14 must be not clear in s or after. In this case, s is state 15. pos14 was not clear in state 9, which is before s. But after state 15, pos14 is clear again (agent moved away). Therefore, in state s (15), pos14 is clear, which violates the constraint. Therefore, this approach doesn't work.

Thus, the only way to satisfy the constraint is to have pos14 not clear in or after state s (when pos34 is not clear). Therefore, the agent must be at pos14 in state s or later. This requires that the agent moves to pos14 after pushing the stone to pos34.

Therefore, the minimal plan would have to include the steps to push the stone to pos34 and then move to pos14. This results in a plan of 12 actions. However, this seems long, and there must be a shorter way. 

Wait, perhaps the agent can push the stone to pos34 and then immediately move towards pos14 in a more direct path. Let me think:

After step 7 (pushtogoal to pos34), agent is at pos44. Then:

8. move player1 pos44 pos34 dirleft → invalid (stone is there)

9. move player1 pos44 pos43 dirup

10. move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft

11. move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft

12. move player1 pos23 pos13 dirleft

13. move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown

Total steps: 13. Still long.

But perhaps there's a different path. For example, from pos44, the agent can move to pos34 (dirleft) if possible. But pos34 is occupied. Alternatively, move to pos54 (dirright), then to pos55 (dirdown), then to pos45 (dirleft), pos35 (dirleft), pos25 (dirleft), etc. But this is even longer.

Given all this, I think the optimal plan is the one that pushes the stone to pos34 and then moves the agent to pos14 in the minimal number of steps. But I'm likely missing a more efficient path.

Wait, perhaps the agent can reach pos14 earlier in the plan, before pushing the stone to pos34, and then leave pos14. But that would require that pos14 is not clear at some point before the stone is at pos34. However, the constraint requires that for any state where pos34 is not clear, pos14 is not clear in that state or after. So if the agent was at pos14 earlier but then leaves, then in the state where pos34 is not clear, pos14 is clear, violating the constraint. Therefore, the only way is to have the agent at pos14 when or after pos34 is not clear.

Thus, the minimal plan must include moving the agent to pos14 after pushing the stone to pos34. Therefore, the plan is as follows:

1. move player1 pos52 pos53 dirdown

2. move player1 pos53 pos43 dirleft

3. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos42 pos43 dirup

4. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos43 pos44 dirdown

5. move player1 pos44 pos43 dirup

6. move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft

7. move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft

8. move player1 pos23 pos13 dirleft

9. move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown

10. move player1 pos14 pos13 dirup

11. move player1 pos13 pos23 dirdown

12. move player1 pos23 pos33 dirdown

13. move player1 pos33 pos43 dirdown

14. move player1 pos43 pos44 dirdown

15. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos44 pos34 dirleft

16. move player1 pos44 pos43 dirup

17. move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft

18. move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft

19. move player1 pos23 pos13 dirleft

20. move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown

This is clearly not optimal. 

Perhaps the constraints can be satisfied in a different way. For example, if during the pushing steps, pos14 is made not clear. But how?

Wait, the initial state has pos14 clear. The only way to make pos14 not clear is for the agent or a stone to be there. Since there's only one stone, it must be the agent. So the agent must visit pos14 after pos34 is not clear. 

But maybe there's a way to push the stone to pos34 and have the agent at pos14 in the same state. For example, if the agent is at pos14 and the stone is at pos34. But how can the agent be at pos14 while pushing the stone to pos34?

It's impossible because the agent must be adjacent to the stone to push it. Therefore, the agent cannot be at pos14 and pushing the stone to pos34 at the same time.

Thus, the only way is to have the agent at pos14 after pushing the stone to pos34. 

Given this, the minimal plan length would be the steps to push the stone to pos34 plus the steps to move to pos14. Given that pushing the stone to pos34 takes 7 steps (move to pos53, pos43, push to pos43, push to pos44, move to pos54, push to pos34), then move to pos14 in 5 steps, total 12 steps. However, I think there's a mistake in the earlier steps. Let's re-express the correct steps.

Correct steps:

Original plan to push the stone to pos34:

1. move player1 pos52 pos53 dirdown

2. move player1 pos53 pos43 dirleft

3. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos42 pos43 dirup → stone at pos43

4. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos43 pos44 dirdown → stone at pos44

5. move player1 pos44 pos54 dirright

6. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos54 pos44 pos34 dirleft → stone at pos34

Now, after step 6, the agent is at pos44. Then:

7. move player1 pos44 pos43 dirup

8. move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft

9. move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft

10. move player1 pos23 pos13 dirleft

11. move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown → pos14 not clear

This totals 11 steps. 

Yes, this is better. Let's break it down:

Step 1: move to pos53.

Step 2: move to pos43.

Step 3: push stone from pos42 to pos43 (agent at pos43).

Step 4: push stone from pos43 to pos44 (agent at pos44).

Step 5: move to pos54.

Step 6: push stone from pos44 to pos34 (agent at pos44).

Step 7: move to pos43.

Step 8: move to pos33.

Step 9: move to pos23.

Step 10: move to pos13.

Step 11: move to pos14.

Total steps: 11.

This satisfies the constraints:

- pos34 is not clear in step 6.

- pos14 is not clear in step 11, which is after step 6.

Therefore, the constraint is satisfied.

So the valid plan is:

```
move player1 pos52 pos53 dirdown
move player1 pos53 pos43 dirleft
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos42 pos43 dirup
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos43 pos44 dirdown
move player1 pos44 pos54 dirright
pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos54 pos44 pos34 dirleft
move player1 pos44 pos43 dirup
move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft
move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft
move player1 pos23 pos13 dirleft
move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown
```
