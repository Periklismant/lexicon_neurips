Okay, let's try to figure out how to solve this planning problem. The goal is to get stone1 to a goal location, which is pos34 in this case. The initial state has the agent (player1) at pos52 and stone1 at pos42. So, I need to move the agent to the stone and then push it to the goal.

First, let's look at the connections between locations. From pos52, the agent can move to pos42 (left) or pos51 (up) or pos53 (down). But stone1 is at pos42, so the agent can move left to pos42. Wait, but in the initial state, pos52 is clear and pos42 is clear. Wait, no, the original state says "stone1 is at location pos42" and "Location pos42 is clear"? Wait, that might be a mistake. Let me check again.

Wait, the original state says "stone1 is at location pos42" and "Location pos42 is clear". That seems conflicting. If a stone is at pos42, then pos42 shouldn't be clear. Maybe that's a typo. Let me check the original state again carefully.

Looking at the original state list: "stone1 is at location pos42" and then later "Location pos42 is clear". That's a contradiction because if a stone is there, the location isn't clear. Maybe there's a mistake in the problem setup. But assuming the problem is correct, perhaps there's an error in the problem description. Alternatively, maybe "clear" refers to something else, but according to the actions' preconditions, moving to a location requires it to be clear. If pos42 has the stone, then it's not clear. But the problem says "Location pos42 is clear". That's confusing.

Wait, maybe "clear" means that there's no agent or stone. But if stone1 is at pos42, then pos42 is not clear. So this might be a problem in the initial state description. However, since the user provided the problem, I have to work with it. Let me re-examine the original state statements.

Original state:

- "player1 is at location pos52"
- "stone1 is at location pos42"
- "Location pos42 is clear"
- "Location pos52 is clear"

Wait, that's impossible. If the stone is at pos42, then pos42 can't be clear. So this must be a mistake. But perhaps in the problem's context, "clear" refers to the agent not being there. Wait, no. The problem's definitions: "Each position on the grid may contain either the agent, a stone or be empty." So, a location is clear if it's empty. But if a stone is there, it's not empty. Therefore, the original state as described is inconsistent. But since the user provided this, maybe there's a misunderstanding. Alternatively, maybe the "clear" statements are only about the agent's presence? But according to the action preconditions, "location l_to is clear" in the move action means that the location is empty (no agent or stone). So, if pos42 has a stone, it's not clear. Therefore, the original state must have a mistake. But perhaps the user intended that the stone is at pos42 and the location is not clear. Maybe the "Location pos42 is clear" is a typo and should be "not clear". But since I have to work with the given problem, I need to proceed.

Assuming that the initial state is correctly given, but perhaps there's a misunderstanding. Let's proceed as per the given data. The stone is at pos42, and pos42 is clear. That's impossible, but perhaps in this problem, "clear" refers to the agent not being present. So, a stone can be at a location, and the location is considered clear for the agent's movement. But the move action's precondition says that the destination must be clear, which would include being free of stones. So this is conflicting.

This is a problem. Maybe the user made a mistake in the problem setup. But since I have to provide a plan, perhaps I should proceed under the assumption that the stone is at pos42 and pos42 is not clear, but the problem says pos42 is clear. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe "clear" in the problem's context refers only to the agent not being there, and stones don't block movement. But the move action's preconditions require the destination to be clear. If a stone is there, then the location isn't clear, so the agent can't move there. So if pos42 has a stone, the agent can't move there. But the agent is at pos52. How can they push the stone?

Wait, the agent can push the stone if adjacent. For example, to push a stone, the agent must be in a position adjacent to the stone in the direction of movement. Let's see. The stone is at pos42. The agent is at pos52. To push the stone, the agent needs to get to a position where they can push it towards the goal, which is pos34.

Looking at the movement connections. Let's map the grid. The positions are posXY, where X is row and Y is column. So pos52 is row 5, column 2. pos42 is row 4, column 2. pos34 is row3, column4.

So, the grid is 5x5, rows 1 to 5 (top to bottom?), columns 1 to 5. So pos11 is top-left, pos55 is bottom-right.

The stone is at pos42 (row4, column2). The goal is pos34 (row3, column4). The agent is at pos52 (row5, column2).

The agent needs to push the stone from pos42 to pos34. Let's think about the path.

First, the agent needs to reach a position adjacent to the stone to push it. Since the stone is at pos42, the agent could approach from pos43 (to the right), pos32 (above), pos41 (left), or pos52 (below). Wait, according to the movement directions, can the agent move from pos52 to pos42? Let's check the allowed movements.

Looking at the 'may move from' statements: "You may move from location pos52 to location pos42 following direction dirleft". So pos52 (row5, column2) can move left to pos42 (row4, column2)? Wait, no. Wait, the directions: dirleft, dirright, dirup, dirdown. Wait, maybe the directions are a bit confusing. For example, moving from pos52 to pos42 would be up, not left. Because pos52 is row5, column2; pos42 is row4, column2. So moving up (dirup) from pos52 would take you to pos42. Let me check the movement list.

Looking for movement from pos52. The original state says:

"You may move from location pos52 to location pos42 following direction dirleft"

Wait, that doesn't make sense. pos52 is (5,2). pos42 is (4,2). Moving left from pos52 would change the column, not the row. So direction dirleft would be moving left in the same row. So moving from pos52 (5,2) left would be to (5,1), but according to the given movements, pos52's movements are:

- "You may move from location pos52 to location pos42 following direction dirleft": Wait, that's odd. Because moving left from pos52 (column2) would be to column1, but pos42 is (4,2). So that seems like a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the directions are different. Maybe the directions are relative to the grid's layout. For example, dirleft could be moving up a row, but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the directions are named differently. Let me check all the movement possibilities for pos52.

The given movements for pos52 are:

- "You may move from location pos52 to location pos42 following direction dirleft": So from pos52, moving dirleft takes you to pos42 (row4, column2). That's up one row. So maybe in this problem, dirleft is actually up, which is confusing. Or perhaps the direction names are mismatched. This is a problem.

Wait, looking at other movement directions. For example, pos52 can move to pos53 via dirdown. pos52 is (5,2), pos53 is (5,3), so dirdown would be moving right in the same row. That's inconsistent with usual directions, but maybe in this problem, dirdown means moving to the next column (right), and dirup means moving to the previous column (left). Or maybe rows and columns are swapped. This is confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the directions are as follows:

- dirup: decrease the row (move up)
- dirdown: increase the row (move down)
- dirleft: decrease the column (move left)
- dirright: increase the column (move right)

But that would make sense. For example, moving from pos52 (5,2) to pos42 (4,2) would be dirup. But according to the problem's movement list, that move is allowed via dirleft, which is conflicting.

Wait, looking at the movement for pos52:

"You may move from location pos52 to location pos42 following direction dirleft"

But pos52 is (5,2), and pos42 is (4,2). Moving from 5 to 4 in row is moving up, which would be dirup. But the direction here is dirleft. So perhaps the directions are not aligned with rows and columns as expected. This is a problem. The movement directions are defined in the problem's movement statements, which may have their own mapping.

Alternatively, perhaps the movement directions are based on adjacency in the grid, but the direction names are arbitrary. For example, moving from pos52 to pos42 is allowed via dirleft, which might mean that in the grid's structure, pos52 is connected to pos42 to the left. But that doesn't make sense spatially. This suggests that the problem's movement graph is not a standard grid but a custom one. Therefore, I need to rely entirely on the given movement connections.

So, according to the problem's movement list, from pos52, the agent can move to pos42 (dirleft), pos51 (dirup), or pos53 (dirdown). Similarly, from pos42, the agent can move to pos32 (dirleft), pos52 (dirright), pos41 (dirup), or pos43 (dirdown). Wait, but pos42's movements are:

"You may move from location pos42 to location pos32 following direction dirleft"

"You may move from location pos42 to location pos52 following direction dirright"

"You may move from location pos42 to location pos41 following direction dirup"

"You may move from location pos42 to location pos43 following direction dirdown"

So, from pos42, dirleft takes you to pos32 (row3, column2), dirright to pos52 (row5, column2), dirup to pos41 (row4, column1), and dirdown to pos43 (row4, column3).

This suggests that the directions are not the standard ones. For example, moving dirleft from pos42 (4,2) takes you to pos32 (3,2), which is up one row. Similarly, dirright from pos42 takes you to pos52 (5,2), down one row. So dirleft and dirright correspond to moving up and down in the row, while dirup and dirdown correspond to moving left and right in the column. That's the opposite of what I'd expect, but that's how the problem has defined the movements.

So, to avoid confusion, I need to treat the directions as per the problem's given movement connections. So, for example, moving dirleft from a location might take you to a different row or column based on the connections listed.

Given that, the agent is at pos52. The stone is at pos42, which is connected via dirleft from pos52. So the agent can move to pos42 via dirleft. But wait, the preconditions for the move action: agent must be at l_from (pos52), l_to (pos42) must be clear. But pos42 has the stone, so it's not clear. Therefore, the agent cannot move to pos42. So the initial state says pos42 is clear, but the stone is there. That's a contradiction.

But according to the original state:

- "stone1 is at location pos42"

- "Location pos42 is clear"

This is impossible. Therefore, there's a mistake in the problem setup. However, since the user provided this, perhaps "Location pos42 is clear" is a mistake and should be "not clear". Alternatively, maybe "clear" refers only to the agent's presence, but that's inconsistent with the action preconditions.

Assuming that the problem has a typo and pos42 is not clear (since the stone is there), the agent cannot move into pos42. Therefore, the agent needs to find another way to reach the stone to push it.

The stone is at pos42. The agent is at pos52. To push the stone, the agent needs to be at a position adjacent to the stone in the direction opposite to where they want to push it.

For example, to push the stone from pos42 to pos32 (dirleft), the agent would need to be at pos42 and push it dirleft. But the agent can't be at pos42 because the stone is there. Alternatively, the agent can be at pos43 (if possible) and push the stone to pos42's direction. Wait, no. The push actions require the agent to be at l_p, which is adjacent to l_from (the stone's current location) in the direction leading to l_from. Then, pushing the stone from l_from to l_to in direction d.

So, for example, if the agent is at pos43 (adjacent to pos42 via dirdown?), and the stone is at pos42, the agent can push the stone to pos32 (if that's a valid direction). Wait, let's check the allowed movements from pos42.

From pos42, the allowed directions are:

- dirleft to pos32 (row3, column2)

- dirright to pos52 (row5, column2)

- dirup to pos41 (row4, column1)

- dirdown to pos43 (row4, column3)

So, if the agent is at pos43, which is dirdown from pos42, then to push the stone from pos42 to pos43 (dirdown), the agent would need to be at pos42, but that's where the stone is. Wait, no. The 'pushtogoal' action requires the agent to be at l_p, which is adjacent to l_from (the stone's position) in the direction d. So, for example, to push the stone from pos42 to pos32 (dirleft), the agent must be at l_p = pos42's dirleft direction's previous position. Wait, no. The precondition for pushtogoal is (iv) you can get from l_p to l_from following direction d. So, the agent is at l_p, and there's a path from l_p to l_from via direction d. Then, pushing the stone from l_from to l_to via direction d.

Wait, perhaps the directions are such that the agent is at a position l_p, and moving in direction d from l_p leads to l_from (the stone's position). Then, moving in direction d from l_from leads to l_to. So the agent must be adjacent to the stone in the direction d, then push the stone in the same direction d.

For example, to push the stone from pos42 to pos32 (dirleft), the agent must be at l_p, which is in the direction opposite to d from l_from. Wait, no. The agent must be at l_p, and from l_p, moving in direction d reaches l_from. So if the agent is at pos52 (row5, column2), and direction d is dirleft (which, according to the movement list, allows moving from pos52 to pos42 via dirleft), then l_p is pos52, l_from is pos42, and moving dirleft from pos52 gets to pos42. Then, the stone is at pos42, and the agent can push it in direction d (dirleft) to l_to, which would be pos32, since moving dirleft from pos42 (as per the movement list) leads to pos32.

So, in this case, the agent is at pos52 (l_p), the stone is at pos42 (l_from). The agent can perform a pushtogoal action if pos32 is a goal location. But pos32 is not a goal location. The only goal location is pos34. So the agent needs to push the stone to pos34.

But how to get the stone from pos42 to pos34. Let's see the path.

pos42 → pos43 (dirdown) → pos44 (dirdown) → pos34 (dirleft). But pos34 is the goal.

Wait, let's check the movement from pos42 to pos43 via dirdown. Then from pos43, moving dirleft would be to pos33 (row3, column3), but according to the movement list:

From pos43, "You may move from location pos43 to location pos33 following direction dirleft" (dirleft from pos43 is pos33). Then from pos33, dirright to pos43, etc.

Alternatively, maybe the agent can push the stone from pos42 to pos43 (dirdown), then from pos43 to pos44 (dirdown), then from pos44 to pos34 (dirleft).

But each push action requires the agent to be adjacent in the direction of the push. Let's break it down.

First, the agent is at pos52. The stone is at pos42. The agent can't move into pos42 because it's occupied by the stone. So the agent needs to get to a position adjacent to the stone to push it.

Looking at the movement options from pos52: the agent can move to pos42 (dirleft), pos51 (dirup), or pos53 (dirdown). But pos42 has the stone, so moving there is impossible. So the agent needs to take another path.

Wait, but the initial state says pos42 is clear, which contradicts the presence of the stone. Assuming that's a mistake and pos42 is not clear, the agent can't move there. So the agent needs to find another way to reach the stone's vicinity.

Alternative approach: The agent can move from pos52 to pos53 (dirdown), then to pos54, etc., but that's moving away from the stone. Alternatively, move to pos51 (dirup), then to pos41 (dirleft?), but let's check.

From pos52, moving dirup takes the agent to pos51. From pos51, movement options are to pos41 (dirleft) or pos52 (dirdown). From pos41, can the agent move to pos31 (dirleft) or pos51 (dirright) or pos42 (dirdown). So, from pos41, moving dirdown takes the agent to pos42. But pos42 has the stone, so if it's not clear, the agent can't move there. So this path is blocked.

Alternatively, the agent could go from pos52 to pos53 (dirdown), then to pos54 (dirdown), but that's moving away from the stone. Not helpful.

Hmm. This seems tricky. Wait, perhaps the agent can push the stone from pos42 to pos43, but to do that, the agent needs to be at pos53 (since from pos53, moving dirleft would reach pos43). Wait, let's check movement from pos53:

From pos53, the agent can move to pos43 (dirleft), pos52 (dirup), or pos54 (dirdown). So, if the agent is at pos53, they can move dirleft to pos43. Then, pos43 is adjacent to pos42 via dirup (from pos43's perspective, moving dirup would be to pos42? Let's check.

Looking at pos43's movement options:

"You may move from location pos43 to location pos33 following direction dirleft"

"You may move from location pos43 to location pos53 following direction dirright"

"You may move from location pos43 to location pos42 following direction dirup"

"You may move from location pos43 to location pos44 following direction dirdown"

Ah, so from pos43, moving dirup takes the agent to pos42. So, if the agent is at pos43, they can move dirup to pos42 (which is where the stone is). But pos42 is occupied by the stone, so the agent can't move there. Therefore, the agent can't reach pos43 and then move to pos42. So how else can they push the stone?

Alternatively, the agent could push the stone from pos42 to pos32 (dirleft), but that's not a goal. Then from pos32 to pos33 (dirright?), but that's getting complicated.

Wait, the goal is pos34. So the stone needs to reach pos34. Let's find a path from pos42 to pos34.

Possible path:

pos42 → pos43 (dirdown) → pos44 (dirdown) → pos34 (dirleft). But each step requires the agent to be in the correct position to push.

Let's see:

First, push the stone from pos42 to pos43 (dirdown). To do this, the agent needs to be at pos53 (since from pos53, moving dirleft to pos43, but how? Wait, the agent needs to be at a position l_p from which moving direction d reaches l_from (pos42). Wait, the preconditions for pushtonongoal (since pos43 is not a goal) would be:

For pushing from pos42 to pos43 (dirdown):

- Agent must be at l_p, which is pos42's direction d (dirdown) previous step. Wait, no. The agent must be at l_p such that moving direction d from l_p leads to l_from (pos42). The direction d here is dirdown. So from l_p, moving dirdown leads to pos42. So l_p must be the location that, when moving dirdown, reaches pos42. Looking at the movement list:

Looking for any location that can move dirdown to pos42. Checking the movement list:

Looking for "You may move from location ... to pos42 following direction dirdown".

Searching the original state's movement list:

"You may move from location pos41 to location pos42 following direction dirdown"

Yes. So, from pos41, moving dirdown reaches pos42. Therefore, to push the stone from pos42 to pos43 (dirdown), the agent must be at pos41 (l_p = pos41), and direction d is dirdown. Then, l_from is pos42, l_to is pos43 (since moving dirdown from pos42 leads to pos43).

But wait, the action is pushtonongoal because pos43 is not a goal. The preconditions for pushtonongoal are:

(i) agent at l_p (pos41)

(ii) stone at l_from (pos42)

(iii) l_to (pos43) is clear

(iv) can move from l_p (pos41) to l_from (pos42) via d (dirdown)

(v) can move from l_from (pos42) to l_to (pos43) via d (dirdown)

(vi) l_to (pos43) is not a goal.

All these are satisfied. So the agent can perform "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos41 pos42 pos43 dirdown".

After this action, the stone is at pos43, and the agent is at pos42.

Now, the stone is at pos43. The next step is to push it to pos44 (dirdown). For that, the agent needs to be at a location l_p from which moving dirdown reaches pos43. Checking the movement list:

"You may move from location pos43 to location pos44 following direction dirdown"

But the agent needs to be at a location that, when moving dirdown, reaches pos43. Looking for any movement to pos43 via dirdown:

Looking in the movement list for "dirdown" leading to pos43:

"You may move from location pos42 to location pos43 following direction dirdown"

So, to push from pos43 to pos44 via dirdown, the agent must be at pos42. But after the previous push, the agent is at pos42 (from the pushtonongoal action's effect: agent moves to l_from, which was pos42). So now, the agent is at pos42, and the stone is at pos43.

To push the stone from pos43 to pos44 (dirdown), the agent needs to be at pos43's dirdown previous location. Wait, no. The agent needs to be at a location l_p where moving direction d (dirdown) leads to l_from (pos43). Looking for movement to pos43 via dirdown:

"You may move from location pos42 to location pos43 following direction dirdown"

So, the agent must be at pos42, which they are. Then, direction d is dirdown. So, the agent can perform pushtonongoal again:

"pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos43 pos44 dirdown"

After this, the stone is at pos44, and the agent is at pos43.

Now, pos44 is not a goal. Next, push the stone from pos44 to pos34 (dirleft). Let's check the movement from pos44:

"You may move from location pos44 to location pos34 following direction dirleft"

Yes. So, to push the stone from pos44 to pos34 (dirleft), the agent needs to be at a location l_p from which moving dirleft reaches pos44. Looking for movement to pos44 via dirleft:

"You may move from location pos54 to location pos44 following direction dirleft"

No. Wait, looking for "You may move from ... to pos44 following direction dirleft". Let's search the movement list:

"You may move from location pos54 to location pos44 following direction dirleft" — no, looking at the list:

The movement list includes:

"You may move from location pos44 to location pos34 following direction dirleft"

But we need the reverse. To find a location that can move dirleft to pos44. So, pos34 can move dirright to pos44? Looking at pos34's movements:

"You may move from location pos34 to location pos24 following direction dirleft"

"You may move from location pos34 to location pos44 following direction dirright"

"You may move from location pos34 to location pos33 following direction dirup"

"You may move from location pos34 to location pos35 following direction dirdown"

So, from pos34, dirright takes you to pos44. Therefore, to move dirleft to pos44, the previous location would be pos54? Wait, no. Let's think differently. For the agent to move dirleft to pos44, they must be at a location that, when moving dirleft, arrives at pos44.

Looking for such a movement in the list:

Looking for any "You may move from location X to pos44 following direction dirleft".

Searching the movement list:

Found:

"You may move from location pos54 to location pos44 following direction dirleft"

Yes. So, if the agent is at pos54, moving dirleft takes them to pos44. But the agent is currently at pos43 after the last push. So, the agent needs to move to pos54 to be able to push the stone from pos44 to pos34.

But how to get from pos43 to pos54? Let's plan the agent's movements.

Current agent position: pos43.

From pos43, the agent can move:

- dirleft to pos33

- dirright to pos53

- dirup to pos42

- dirdown to pos44

But pos44 has the stone after the previous push. Wait, after pushing to pos44, the stone is there, so pos44 is not clear. Therefore, the agent cannot move to pos44. So, from pos43, the agent can move to pos33, pos53, or pos42.

From pos43, moving dirleft to pos33. Then, from pos33, where can they go?

But this seems complicated. Alternatively, the agent can move from pos43 to pos53 via dirright. Then from pos53 to pos54 via dirdown. Then from pos54 to pos44 via dirleft. But pos44 has the stone, so the agent can't move there. Therefore, the agent needs to reach pos54 to push the stone from pos44 to pos34.

Wait, but the stone is at pos44. To push it to pos34 (dirleft), the agent must be at pos54 (since moving dirleft from pos54 leads to pos44). Then, pushing dirleft from pos44 to pos34. So the steps would be:

1. Agent moves from pos43 to pos53 (dirright).

2. Agent moves from pos53 to pos54 (dirdown).

Now, agent is at pos54. Then, perform "pushtogoal" (since pos34 is a goal) action:

"pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos54 pos44 pos34 dirleft"

Preconditions check:

(i) agent at pos54 — yes.

(ii) stone at pos44 — yes.

(iii) pos34 is clear — initially, yes, since pos34 is a goal location and in the original state, it's clear. But after previous actions, we need to track state.

Assuming after the previous pushes, pos34 is clear. So:

(iv) can move from pos54 to pos44 via dirleft — yes, according to movement list.

(v) can move from pos44 to pos34 via dirleft — yes.

(vi) pos34 is a goal — yes.

So this action is valid.

After this action, the stone is at pos34 (goal), and the agent is at pos44.

So the complete plan would be:

1. Move the agent from pos52 to pos41. Wait, how? Because the initial position is pos52. To get to pos41, the agent needs to move dirup to pos51, then dirleft to pos41.

Wait, initial steps:

Initial state: agent at pos52.

To reach pos41:

- move pos52 to pos51 via dirup.

- move pos51 to pos41 via dirleft.

Then perform the first push:

pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos41 pos42 pos43 dirdown.

Then agent is at pos42.

Next, push from pos42 to pos43:

Wait, no. Wait, after the first push, the stone is at pos43, and the agent is at pos42.

Then, the next push would be from pos43 to pos44, but the agent needs to be at a position that allows pushing. Since the stone is at pos43, to push it dirdown to pos44, the agent must be at a location l_p from which moving dirdown leads to pos43. Which is pos42. So the agent is already at pos42. So the next action is:

pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos43 pos44 dirdown.

After this, stone is at pos44, agent at pos43.

Then, agent needs to move to pos54:

From pos43, move dirright to pos53.

From pos53, move dirdown to pos54.

Then, perform pushtogoal from pos54 to pos44 to pos34 dirleft.

So putting it all together:

1. move player1 pos52 pos51 dirup

2. move player1 pos51 pos41 dirleft

3. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos41 pos42 pos43 dirdown

4. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos43 pos44 dirdown

5. move player1 pos43 pos53 dirright

6. move player1 pos53 pos54 dirdown

7. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos54 pos44 pos34 dirleft

But let's verify each step's preconditions.

Step 1: move from pos52 to pos51 via dirup. Preconditions: agent at pos52, pos51 clear. According to initial state, pos51 is clear. Yes.

Step 2: move from pos51 to pos41 via dirleft. Movement from pos51 to pos41 is allowed via dirleft (check movement list: "You may move from location pos51 to location pos41 following direction dirleft"). Preconditions: pos41 is clear. Initial state says pos41 is clear. Yes.

Step 3: pushtonongoal. Agent at pos41, stone at pos42. Pushing to pos43 (dirdown). Check movement from pos41 to pos42 via dirdown (yes: "You may move from location pos41 to location pos42 following direction dirdown"). Then movement from pos42 to pos43 via dirdown (yes). pos43 is not a goal. pos43 is clear (initially yes). After this action, agent moves to pos42, stone to pos43.

Step4: pushtonongoal from pos42 to pos43 to pos44. Agent is now at pos42. Check movement from pos42 to pos43 via dirdown (yes). pos44 must be clear. Initially yes. pos44 is not a goal. So this action is valid. After this, agent is at pos43, stone at pos44.

Step5: move from pos43 to pos53 via dirright. Check movement: "You may move from location pos43 to location pos53 following direction dirright". pos53 is clear initially, but after previous steps? After step4, pos53 is clear unless something else is there. The original state says pos53 is clear, and no actions have affected it. So yes.

Step6: move from pos53 to pos54 via dirdown. Check movement: "You may move from location pos53 to location pos54 following direction dirdown". pos54 is clear (original state says clear). Yes.

Step7: pushtogoal from pos54 to pos44 to pos34 via dirleft. Check preconditions: agent at pos54, stone at pos44, pos34 clear. pos34 is a goal. Movement from pos54 to pos44 via dirleft (yes: "You may move from location pos54 to location pos44 following direction dirleft"). Movement from pos44 to pos34 via dirleft (yes: "You may move from location pos44 to location pos34 following direction dirleft"). pos34 is a goal. So this action is valid.

After this, the stone is at pos34, which is the goal. So this plan should work.

But wait, is there a shorter path? For example, can the agent move from pos52 to pos42 via dirleft if pos42 is clear? But according to the problem's initial state, pos42 is clear but has the stone. This is conflicting, but assuming that's a mistake and pos42 is not clear (because of the stone), the agent can't move there. So the steps above are necessary.

Alternatively, if the initial state allows the agent to move to pos42 (since it's erroneously marked as clear), then the plan could be shorter. For example:

1. move player1 pos52 pos42 dirleft

2. push the stone to pos32 (dirleft), but pos32 is not a goal.

3. Then need to push further.

But since pos34 is the only goal, that's not helpful. So the initial approach is better.

Therefore, the plan with 7 steps is likely the optimal one. But let's check if any steps can be merged or avoided.

Wait, after step3, the agent is at pos42. Then, step4 requires the agent to be at pos42 to push to pos44. That's valid. Then steps 5 and 6 are moving the agent to pos54. Can the agent reach pos54 faster?

Alternative path from pos43 to pos54:

From pos43, can the agent move dirdown to pos44? But pos44 has the stone after step4, so it's not clear. So no.

So steps 5 and 6 are necessary.

Therefore, the plan as outlined should be valid and optimal.
