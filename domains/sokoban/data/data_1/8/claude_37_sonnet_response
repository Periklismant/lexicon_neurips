Let me understand the problem:

1. We have a 2D square grid (5x5 in this case).
2. Each position can contain the agent (player1), a stone, or be empty.
3. Each position is flagged as either a goal position or a non-goal position.
4. The goal is to manipulate the agent to move all stones to goal positions.

The available actions are:
- "move p l_from l_to d": Move agent p from l_from to l_to following direction d.
- "pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": Agent p, at location l_p, pushes stone s from l_from to a goal location l_to, following direction d.
- "pushtonongoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": Agent p, at location l_p, pushes stone s from l_from to a non-goal location l_to, following direction d.

Let's examine the initial state:
- player1 is at location pos52
- stone1 is at location pos42
- pos34 is a goal location

The task is to bring about the situation where "stone1 is at a goal location."

Additionally, there are constraints:
1. At least one state in the plan must have "Location pos34 is not clear."
2. If "Location pos34 is not clear" holds in some state s, then "Location pos14 is not clear" must hold at s or at some state after s.

From the initial state, stone1 is at pos42. The only goal location is pos34. So, we need to move stone1 from pos42 to pos34.

Let's understand the 2D grid layout. The positions are labeled posXY, where X is the row (starting from 1) and Y is the column (starting from 1). 

Here's a visual representation of the grid (p: player, s: stone, g: goal location):
```
11 12 13 14 15
21 22 23 24 25
31 32 33 g  35
41  s 43 44 45
p  52 53 54 55
```

Now, let's think about how to move stone1 to the goal:

1. Player is at pos52, stone1 is at pos42.
2. Player needs to be adjacent to stone1 to push it.
3. So, the player needs to move to a position adjacent to stone1, then push the stone towards the goal.

I need to plan the path to move stone1 to pos34. From pos42, the stone needs to move left to pos32, then down to pos33, then down to pos34.

But first, the player needs to be in a position to push the stone. Given the player is at pos52, they can move to pos42 (where the stone is), but they can't push the stone from there. They need to be in pos32 (to push right), pos43 (to push up), pos52 (to push left), or pos41 (to push down).

Looking at the directions:
- push right: player at pos32, stone at pos42, stone moves to pos52
- push up: player at pos43, stone at pos42, stone moves to pos41
- push left: player at pos52, stone at pos42, stone moves to pos32
- push down: player at pos41, stone at pos42, stone moves to pos43

Since pos34 is to the left of pos42, we should push the stone left, then down.

Wait, I think I made a mistake in my grid layout. Let me review the connections in the initial state to understand the grid better.

I can move from pos11 to pos21 following direction dirright. This indicates that pos21 is to the right of pos11.
I can move from pos11 to pos12 following direction dirdown. This indicates that pos12 is below pos11.

Given this, XY refers to Y as row and X as column. Let me re-visualize the grid:

```
11 21 31 41 51
12 22 32 42 52(p)
13 23 33 43 53
14 24 34(g) 44 54
15 25 35 45 55
```

So, pos52 is in the 2nd row, 5th column, and pos42 is in the 2nd row, 4th column. That is, the stone is to the left of the player. The goal is at pos34 (4th row, 3rd column).

Now, to move the stone to the goal, we need to:
1. push stone1 left from pos42 to pos32
2. push stone1 down from pos32 to pos33
3. push stone1 down from pos33 to pos34 (goal)

Let's also keep in mind the constraints:
1. At least one state in the plan must have "Location pos34 is not clear."
2. If "Location pos34 is not clear" holds in some state s, then "Location pos14 is not clear" must hold at s or at some state after s.

In step 3, when stone1 is pushed to pos34, the goal location will not be clear. So, the first constraint will be satisfied.

For the second constraint, after pos34 is not clear, we need to ensure pos14 is not clear at the same time or afterwards. This means after pushing the stone to the goal, we need to move the player to pos14 and make it not clear. (Or, if the stone was at pos14 at some point, but given our current plan, it won't be).

Let's proceed with planning the moves:

1. Initial state: player1 at pos52, stone1 at pos42, goal at pos34.

From here, I need to get the player to a position where they can push the stone to pos32. The player can push from pos52 (left), but they need to be at pos52 relative to the stone (at pos42). The player is already at pos52, so they can push left from there.

Wait, I'm getting confused again. Let's revisit the grid representation based on the connection information.

Let me check the available moves:
You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright.
You may move from location pos11 to location pos12 following direction dirdown.

This indicates that pos21 is to the right of pos11, and pos12 is below pos11. So, the first digit is the row, and the second digit is the column.

Let's redo the grid visualization:

```
11 12 13 14 15
21 22 23 24 25
31 32 33 34(g) 35
41 42(s) 43 44 45
51 52(p) 53 54 55
```

So, in the initial state, the player is at pos52 (5th row, 2nd column) and the stone is at pos42 (4th row, 2nd column). The goal is at pos34 (3rd row, 4th column).

To move the stone to the goal, I need to:
1. Push stone1 right from pos42 to pos43
2. Push stone1 right from pos43 to pos44
3. Push stone1 up from pos44 to pos34 (goal)

Now, let's plan the actions:

Initial state: player1 at pos52, stone1 at pos42.

1. First, the player needs to move to a position where they can push the stone. They need to be at pos41 to push right.
   - move player1 pos52 pos51 dirleft
   - move player1 pos51 pos41 dirup

2. Now, the player needs to push the stone to pos43:
   - pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos41 pos42 pos43 dirright

3. The player is now at pos42, and the stone is at pos43. The player needs to push the stone to pos44:
   - pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos43 pos44 dirright

4. The player is now at pos43, and the stone is at pos44. The player needs to push the stone to pos34:
   - pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos44 pos34 dirup

At this point, the stone is at the goal location (pos34), which is the primary objective. The constraint "Location pos34 is not clear" is also satisfied because the stone is at pos34. 

However, we still need to satisfy the second constraint. If "Location pos34 is not clear" holds, then "Location pos14 is not clear" must hold at that state or later. Currently, pos14 is clear. 

So, I need to move the player to pos14 to make it not clear:
5. The player is now at pos44. They need to move to pos14:
   - move player1 pos44 pos34 dirleft
   - move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft
   - move player1 pos24 pos14 dirleft

Now, pos14 is not clear, satisfying the second constraint.

Let's review our plan:
1. move player1 pos52 pos51 dirleft
2. move player1 pos51 pos41 dirup
3. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos41 pos42 pos43 dirright
4. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos43 pos44 dirright
5. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos44 pos34 dirup
6. move player1 pos44 pos34 dirleft (Wait, this is invalid because pos34 is not clear at this point. Let me rethink...)

I seem to be making a mistake here. After pushing the stone to pos34, the player would be at pos44, not pos43. 

But there's a contradiction in the constraints. The second constraint says: "If expression 'Location pos34 is not clear' holds in some state s, then expression 'Location pos14 is not clear' must hold at s or at some state after s."

Since we need to move the stone to pos34 to satisfy the primary goal, pos34 will be not clear. This means we also need to ensure pos14 is not clear either by moving the player there or placing the stone there at some point.

Wait, let me reconsider the possible paths. Let's see if we can push the stone via pos14, pos24, pos34.

From the initial state:
1. player1 is at pos52 and stone1 is at pos42.
2. We need to move player1 to pos32 to push the stone up (from pos42 to pos32).
3. Then, we'll push the stone left toward the goal.

Let's plan:
1. move player1 pos52 pos42 dirleft (Note: this isn't valid because pos42 has the stone. Let me rethink...)

Ah, I see the issue. The stone is in the way. Let me revisit the grid and path planning.

Initial state: player1 at pos52, stone1 at pos42, goal at pos34.

Actually, looking at the problem description, I think I was misinterpreting the preconditions for the actions. Let's re-analyze:

For "pushtogoal", the preconditions say:
- (i) agent p is at location l_p
- (ii) stone s is at location l_from
- (iii) location l_to is clear
- (iv) you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d
- (v) you can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d
- (vi) location l_to is a goal location

This means that the agent pushes the stone from l_from to l_to after moving from l_p to l_from. The agent doesn't need to be behind the stone; it just needs to be able to move to the stone's location, and then the stone needs to be able to move in the direction d.

For "pushtonongoal", the interpretation is similar, but the destination is not a goal location.

So, let's re-plan:

Initial state: player1 at pos52, stone1 at pos42, goal at pos34.

1. The player needs to move to a position where they can push the stone. Looking at the connections, they can move from pos52 to pos42 following direction dirleft.
   - move player1 pos52 pos51 dirleft
   - move player1 pos51 pos41 dirup
   - pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos41 pos42 pos32 dirleft

2. Now, the player is at pos42, and the stone is at pos32. The player needs to move to push the stone to pos33:
   - move player1 pos42 pos32 dirleft
   - move player1 pos32 pos22 dirup
   - move player1 pos22 pos23 dirdown
   - move player1 pos23 pos33 dirright
   - pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos32 pos33 dirdown

3. The player is now at pos32, and the stone is at pos33. The player needs to move to push the stone to pos34:
   - move player1 pos32 pos33 dirdown
   - move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft
   - move player1 pos23 pos24 dirdown
   - move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright
   - pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos33 pos34 dirright

At this point, the stone is at the goal location (pos34), and the constraint "Location pos34 is not clear" is satisfied.

To satisfy the second constraint (if pos34 is not clear, then pos14 must also be not clear), we need to move the player to pos14.

I think there's still something off with my understanding. Let me revisit the preconditions for the push actions. The interpretation I gave above doesn't seem right given the direction parameter.

For "pushtogoal", the preconditions say:
- (iv) you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d
- (v) you can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d

This suggests that the direction is used both for the agent to move to the stone's location and for the stone to move from its current location to the destination. This is confusing because the direction might be different for these two moves.

Alright, let's be more careful and check what the actions in the problem statement mean exactly. The "pushtogoal" action specifies:

"pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": Make agent p, situated at location l_p, push stone s from location l_from to goal location l_to, following direction d.

The preconditions state:
- (i) agent p is at location l_p
- (ii) stone s is at location l_from
- (iii) location l_to is clear
- (iv) you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d
- (v) you can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d
- (vi) location l_to is a goal location

This means the agent is at l_p, and they push the stone from l_from to l_to. The direction d seems to define the straight line of push: from l_p to l_from to l_to. 

So, for the agent to push the stone from pos42 to pos32, the agent would need to be at pos52. The action would be: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos52 pos42 pos32 dirleft.

Ah, I think I understand now. The direction specifies a straight line: agent -> stone -> destination. For example, if d is dirleft, then the agent should be to the right of the stone, the stone is in the middle, and the destination is to the left.

Let's revise our plan:

Initial state: player1 at pos52, stone1 at pos42, goal at pos34.

1. Since the player is at pos52 and the stone is at pos42, the player can push the stone to pos32 following direction dirleft.
   - pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos52 pos42 pos32 dirleft

2. Now, the player is at pos42, and the stone is at pos32. To push the stone to pos33, the player would need to be at pos31. Let's move there:
   - move player1 pos42 pos32 dirleft
   - move player1 pos32 pos31 dirleft
   - pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos32 pos33 dirright

3. The player is now at pos32, and the stone is at pos33. To push the stone to pos34, the player would need to be at pos32:
   - move player1 pos32 pos22 dirup
   - move player1 pos22 pos23 dirdown
   - pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos33 pos43 dirright

4. I made a mistake above. I need to get the stone to pos34, not pos43. Let me rethink.

Ok, let me visualize the grid and the path for the stone from the initial state to the goal:

```
11 12 13 14 15
21 22 23 24 25
31 32 33 34(g) 35
41 42(s) 43 44 45
51 52(p) 53 54 55
```

The stone starts at pos42, and we want to move it to pos34. A possible path is:
- pos42 -> pos32 -> pos33 -> pos34

To push the stone from pos42 to pos32, the player should be to the right of the stone (at pos52), which is the case initially. So, we can immediately push the stone up.

To push the stone from pos32 to pos33, the player should be to the left of the stone (at pos31).

To push the stone from pos33 to pos34, the player should be to the left of the stone (at pos23).

Let me rewrite the plan:

1. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos52 pos42 pos32 dirleft

2. Now, the player is at pos42, and the stone is at pos32. To push the stone to pos33, the player would need to be at pos31.
   - move player1 pos42 pos32 dirleft
   - move player1 pos32 pos31 dirleft
   - pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos32 pos33 dirright

3. The player is now at pos32, and the stone is at pos33. To push the stone to pos34, the player would need to be at pos23.
   - move player1 pos32 pos22 dirup
   - move player1 pos22 pos23 dirright
   - pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos33 pos34 dirup

At this point, the stone is at the goal location (pos34), which satisfies the primary objective. The constraint "Location pos34 is not clear" is also satisfied because the stone is at pos34.

To satisfy the second constraint (if pos34 is not clear, then pos14 must also be not clear), we need to move the player to pos14:
4. move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft
5. move player1 pos23 pos22 dirpup
6. move player1 pos22 pos12 dirleft
7. move player1 pos12 pos13 dirdown
8. move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown

Wait, I made a mistake. Moving from pos33 to pos23 following dirleft isn't mentioned in the connections. Let me recheck.

Looking at the connections related to pos33:
- "You may move from location pos33 to location pos23 following direction dirleft"
- "You may move from location pos33 to location pos43 following direction dirright"
- "You may move from location pos33 to location pos32 following direction dirup"
- "You may move from location pos33 to location pos34 following direction dirdown"

So, I can move from pos33 to pos23 following direction dirleft. Let's correct the plan:

4. move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft
5. move player1 pos23 pos13 dirleft
6. move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown

Now, the player is at pos14, making it not clear, which satisfies the second constraint.

Actually, one more error. In step 3, the player is at pos32, and the stone is at pos33. Given the direction is dirup, the player needs to be below the stone to push it up. So, the player should be at pos43, not pos23.

Let me fix step 3:
3. The player is now at pos32, and the stone is at pos33. To push the stone to pos34, the player would need to be at pos43.
   - move player1 pos32 pos33 dirdown
   - move player1 pos33 pos43 dirright
   - pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos33 pos34 dirup

At this point, the stone is at the goal location (pos34), and the player is at pos33.

Now, to satisfy the second constraint, we need to move the player to pos14:
4. move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft
5. move player1 pos23 pos13 dirleft
6. move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown

Wait, I'm making a mistake again. In step 3, after the player pushes the stone, the player would be at pos33, not pos43.

Let me redo step 3:
3. The player is now at pos32, and the stone is at pos33. To push the stone to pos34, the player would need to be at pos43.
   - move player1 pos32 pos33 dirdown
   - move player1 pos33 pos43 dirright
   - pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos33 pos34 dirup

After this, the stone is at pos34 (goal), and the player is at pos33.

Now, to satisfy the second constraint:
4. move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft
5. move player1 pos23 pos13 dirleft
6. move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown

Now, the player is at pos14, making it not clear, which satisfies the second constraint.

Actually, I've been making an error in my understanding of the push actions. Let me reread the description.

"pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": Make agent p, situated at location l_p, push stone s from location l_from to goal location l_to, following direction d.

The preconditions state:
- (i) agent p is at location l_p
- (ii) stone s is at location l_from
- (iii) location l_to is clear
- (iv) you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d
- (v) you can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d
- (vi) location l_to is a goal location

The effects state:
- (i) agent p is no longer at location l_p
- (ii) stone s is no longer at location l_from
- (iii) location l_to is no longer clear
- (iv) agent p is at location l_from
- (v) stone s is at location l_to
- (vi) location l_p is clear
- (vi) stone s is at a goal state

So, the agent is at l_p, the stone is at l_from, and the destination for the stone is l_to. The direction d is used to verify that you can move from l_p to l_from and from l_from to l_to in that direction.

With this clarification, let's revise our plan:

Initial state: player1 at pos52, stone1 at pos42, goal at pos34.

1. First, we need to verify if the player can push the stone from pos42 to pos32 following some direction:
   - The player is at pos52.
   - The stone is at pos42.
   - We want to move the stone to pos32.
   - To check if this is possible, we need to see if you can get from pos52 to pos42 following direction dirup and from pos42 to pos32 following direction dirup.
   - From the connections in the initial state:
     - "You may move from location pos52 to location pos42 following direction dirleft"
     - "You may move from location pos42 to location pos32 following direction dirleft"
   - So, the player can push the stone from pos42 to pos32 following direction dirleft, not dirup.

I made a mistake above. The direction to push the stone from pos42 to pos32 is dirleft, not dirup. Let me check the connections:
- "You may move from location pos52 to location pos42 following direction dirleft"
- "You may move from location pos42 to location pos32 following direction dirleft"

So, the push would be:
1. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos52 pos42 pos32 dirleft

Let me continue revising:
Initial state: player1 at pos52, stone1 at pos42, goal at pos34.

1. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos52 pos42 pos32 dirleft
   After this, the player is at pos42, and the stone is at pos32.

2. Now, to push the stone from pos32 to pos33, I need to find a direction such that:
   - The player can move from their current position (pos42) to pos32 following that direction,
   - And the stone can move from pos32 to pos33 following that same direction.
   - From the connections:
     - "You may move from location pos42 to location pos32 following direction dirleft"
     - "You may move from location pos32 to location pos33 following direction dirdown"
   - So, the player can't push the stone from pos32 to pos33 directly. The player needs to move to a position where they can push the stone.

Let's revisit the grid:
```
11 12 13 14 15
21 22 23 24 25
31 32 33 34(g) 35
41 42 43 44 45
51 52 53 54 55
```

After the first push, the player is at pos42, and the stone is at pos32. To push the stone from pos32 to pos33, the player needs to be at a position where they can move to pos32 following some direction, and then the stone can move from pos32 to pos33 following that same direction.

From the connections, we know:
- "You may move from location pos32 to location pos33 following direction dirdown"

So, the player needs to be at a position from which they can move to pos32 following direction dirdown. Let's check what positions can move to pos32:
- "You may move from location pos22 to location pos32 following direction dirright"
- "You may move from location pos42 to location pos32 following direction dirleft"
- "You may move from location pos31 to location pos32 following direction dirdown"
- "You may move from location pos33 to location pos32 following direction dirup"

Among these, only pos31 satisfies the requirement: player can move from pos31 to pos32 following direction dirdown, and stone can move from pos32 to pos33 following direction dirdown.

So, the player needs to move from pos42 to pos31:
2. move player1 pos42 pos32 dirleft
3. move player1 pos32 pos31 dirleft

Now, the player is at pos31, and the stone is at pos32. The player can push the stone from pos32 to pos33 following direction dirdown:
4. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos32 pos33 dirdown

After this, the player is at pos32, and the stone is at pos33. To push the stone from pos33 to pos34, I need to find a direction such that:
- The player can move from their current position (pos32) to pos33 following that direction,
- And the stone can move from pos33 to pos34 following that same direction.
- From the connections:
  - "You may move from location pos32 to location pos33 following direction dirdown"
  - "You may move from location pos33 to location pos34 following direction dirdown"
- So, the player can push the stone from pos33 to pos34 following direction dirdown.

5. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos33 pos34 dirdown

At this point, the stone is at the goal location (pos34), and the player is at pos33. The constraint "Location pos34 is not clear" is satisfied. 

To satisfy the second constraint (if pos34 is not clear, then pos14 must also be not clear), we need to move the player to pos14:
6. move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft
7. move player1 pos23 pos13 dirleft
8. move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown

Alright, I think our plan is now correct. Let's check:

1. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos52 pos42 pos32 dirleft
   - Player is now at pos42, stone is at pos32
2. move player1 pos42 pos32 dirleft
   - Player is now at pos32, stone is at pos32 (wait, this doesn't make sense. The stone is already at pos32)

Let me recheck the effects of the push action:
- The agent moves from its initial location (l_p) to the stone's initial location (l_from).
- The stone moves from its initial location (l_from) to the destination (l_to).

So after step 1, the player is at pos42, and the stone is at pos32. The player can't move to pos32 because the stone is there. I need to find a way to navigate around the stone.

I really need to be more careful. Let's review the problem statement again. After the "pushtonongoal" action, the effects are:
- (i) agent p is no longer at location l_p
- (ii) stone s is no longer at location l_from
- (iii) location l_to is no longer clear
- (iv) agent p is at location l_from
- (v) stone s is at location l_to
- (vi) location l_p is clear
- (vi) stone s is at a non goal state

So after pushing the stone from pos42 to pos32, the player would be at pos42, and the stone would be at pos32 (which is now not clear).

The stone is at pos32, but the player also moves from pos52 to the stone's old location, pos42. So the player is at pos42, and pos52 is now clear.

Let's redo the plan:

Initial state: player1 at pos52, stone1 at pos42, goal at pos34.

1. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos52 pos42 pos32 dirleft
   After this, the player is at pos42, and the stone is at pos32.

2. Now, to push the stone from pos32 to pos33, the player needs to be at pos31. Let's move there:
   (I need to go around the stone)
   - move player1 pos42 pos43 dirright
   - move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft
   - move player1 pos33 pos32 dirleft (Wait, this isn't valid because pos32 has the stone)

Hmm, I can't move directly to pos31 from pos42 without going through pos32, which has the stone.

Let's see if I can use another direction to push the stone from pos32 to pos33. From the connections:
- "You may move from location pos32 to location pos33 following direction dirdown"
- "You may move from location pos22 to location pos32 following direction dirright"
- "You may move from location pos42 to location pos32 following direction dirleft"
- "You may move from location pos31 to location pos32 following direction dirdown"
- "You may move from location pos33 to location pos32 following direction dirup"

So, the player can push the stone from pos32 to pos33 following direction dirdown if the player is at pos31.

To get to pos31 from pos42, I need to find a path that doesn't go through pos32. Let's see the connections:
- "You may move from location pos42 to location pos41 following direction dirup"
- "You may move from location pos41 to location pos31 following direction dirleft"

So, the player can move from pos42 to pos41, then to pos31. Let's update the plan:

Initial state: player1 at pos52, stone1 at pos42, goal at pos34.

1. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos52 pos42 pos32 dirleft
   After this, the player is at pos42, and the stone is at pos32.

2. move player1 pos42 pos41 dirup
3. move player1 pos41 pos31 dirleft
4. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos32 pos33 dirdown

After this, the player is at pos32, and the stone is at pos33. To push the stone from pos33 to pos34 following direction dirdown, the player needs to be at pos23. Let's check the connections:
- "You may move from location pos33 to location pos34 following direction dirdown"
- "You may move from location pos23 to location pos33 following direction dirright"
- "You may move from location pos43 to location pos33 following direction dirleft"
- "You may move from location pos32 to location pos33 following direction dirdown"
- "You may move from location pos34 to location pos33 following direction dirup"

So, the player can push the stone from pos33 to pos34 following direction dirdown if the player is at pos23.

To get to pos23 from pos32, I need to:
5. move player1 pos32 pos22 dirup
6. move player1 pos22 pos23 dirdown
7. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos33 pos34 dirdown

At this point, the stone is at the goal location (pos34), and the player is at pos33.

To satisfy the second constraint (if pos34 is not clear, then pos14 must also be not clear), I need to move the player to pos14:
8. move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft
9. move player1 pos23 pos13 dirleft
10. move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown

Let's check this final plan again.

You know what, I'm going to just check the connections directly right now to make sure I'm not missing anything:

Let's check the connections involving positions that are important for our plan:

1. To push from pos42 to pos32, the player needs to be at pos52 and move from pos52 to pos42 following direction dirleft, and then from pos42 to pos32 following direction dirleft.
   From the connections:
   - "You may move from location pos52 to location pos42 following direction dirleft"
   - "You may move from location pos42 to location pos32 following direction dirleft"
   So, this push is valid.

2. To move from pos42 to pos31 via pos41, I need to check:
   - "You may move from location pos42 to location pos41 following direction dirup"
   - "You may move from location pos41 to location pos31 following direction dirleft"
   These are both present in the connections.

3. To push from pos32 to pos33, the player needs to be at pos31 and move from pos31 to pos32 following direction dirdown, and then from pos32 to pos33 following direction dirdown.
   From the connections:
   - "You may move from location pos31 to location pos32 following direction dirdown"
   - "You may move from location pos32 to location pos33 following direction dirdown"
   So, this push is valid.

4. To move from pos32 to pos23 via pos22, I need to check:
   - "You may move from location pos32 to location pos22 following direction dirup"
   - "You may move from location pos22 to location pos23 following direction dirdown"
   These are both present in the connections.

5. To push from pos33 to pos34, the player needs to be at pos23 and move from pos23 to pos33 following direction dirdown, and then from pos33 to pos34 following direction dirdown.
   From the connections:
   - "You may move from location pos23 to location pos33 following direction dirdown"
   - "You may move from location pos33 to location pos34 following direction dirdown"
   So, this push is valid.

6. To move from pos33 to pos14, I need to check:
   - "You may move from location pos33 to location pos23 following direction dirleft"
   - "You may move from location pos23 to location pos13 following direction dirleft"
   - "You may move from location pos13 to location pos14 following direction dirdown"
   These are all present in the connections.

Great, all moves are valid. The plan is:

```
1. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos52 pos42 pos32 dirleft
2. move player1 pos42 pos41 dirup
3. move player1 pos41 pos31 dirleft
4. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos32 pos33 dirdown
5. move player1 pos32 pos22 dirup
6. move player1 pos22 pos23 dirdown
7. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos33 pos34 dirdown
8. move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft
9. move player1 pos23 pos13 dirleft
10. move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown
```

Actually, let me recheck all of the actions in the problem statement a little more closely:

"move p l_from l_to d": Move agent p from location l_from to location l_to following direction d.
Preconditions:
- (i) agent p is at location l_from
- (ii) location l_to is clear
- (iii) you can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d

"pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": Make agent p, situated at location l_p, push stone s from location l_from to goal location l_to, following direction d.
Preconditions:
- (i) agent p is at location l_p
- (ii) stone s is at location l_from
- (iii) location l_to is clear
- (iv) you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d
- (v) you can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d
- (vi) location l_to is a goal location

"pushtonongoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": Make agent p, situated at location l_p, push stone s from location l_from to non-goal location l_to, following direction d.
Preconditions:
- (i) agent p is at location l_p
- (ii) stone s is at location l_from
- (iii) location l_to is clear
- (iv) you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d
- (v) you can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d
- (vi) location l_to is not a goal location

Let me double check just one more time.

From the initial state, I know that pos34 is a goal location. For "pushtogoal", the preconditions say that "location l_to is a goal location". So, when pushing the stone to pos34, I would use "pushtogoal" because pos34 is a goal location.

In the current working plan, I am using "pushtogoal" when pushing to pos34, which is correct.

For "pushtonongoal", the preconditions say that "location l_to is not a goal location". So, when pushing the stone to positions other than pos34, I would use "pushtonongoal".

In the current working plan, I am using "pushtonongoal" when pushing to pos32 and pos33, which are not goal locations. This is correct.

Let me check the effects of the actions once more:

"move p l_from l_to d": 
Effects:
- (i) agent p is no longer at location l_from
- (ii) location l_to is no longer clear
- (iii) agent p is at location l_to
- (iv) location l_from is clear

"pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d":
Effects:
- (i) agent p is no longer at location l_p
- (ii) stone s is no longer at location l_from
- (iii) location l_to is no longer clear
- (iv) agent p is at location l_from
- (v) stone s is at location l_to
- (vi) location l_p is clear
- (vi) stone s is at a goal state

"pushtonongoal p s l_p l_from l_to d":
Effects:
- (i) agent p is no longer at location l_p
- (ii) stone s is no longer at location l_from
- (iii) location l_to is no longer clear
- (iv) agent p is at location l_from
- (v) stone s is at location l_to
- (vi) location l_p is clear
- (vi) stone s is at a non goal state

So the "pushtogoal" and "pushtonongoal" actions both result in the agent moving to the stone's location and the stone moving to the destination. This matches my understanding.

Let's double-check our plan, considering the effects:

Initial state: player1 at pos52, stone1 at pos42, goal at pos34.

1. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos52 pos42 pos32 dirleft
   After this, the player is at pos42, the stone is at pos32, and pos52 is clear.

2. move player1 pos42 pos41 dirup
   After this, the player is at pos41, and pos42 is clear.

3. move player1 pos41 pos31 dirleft
   After this, the player is at pos31, and pos41 is clear.

4. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos32 pos33 dirdown
   After this, the player is at pos32, the stone is at pos33, and pos31 is clear.

5. move player1 pos32 pos22 dirup
   After this, the player is at pos22, and pos32 is clear.

6. move player1 pos22 pos23 dirdown
   After this, the player is at pos23, and pos22 is clear.

7. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos33 pos34 dirdown
   After this, the player is at pos33, the stone is at pos34, pos23 is clear, and the stone is at a goal state.

8. move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft
   After this, the player is at pos23, and pos33 is clear.

9. move player1 pos23 pos13 dirleft
   After this, the player is at pos13, and pos23 is clear.

10. move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown
    After this, the player is at pos14, and pos13 is clear.

This looks good. The stone ends up at the goal location (pos34), and we satisfy the constraints.

I would now give the final plan again:

1. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos52 pos42 pos32 dirleft
2. move player1 pos42 pos41 dirup
3. move player1 pos41 pos31 dirleft
4. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos32 pos33 dirdown
5. move player1 pos32 pos22 dirup
6. move player1 pos22 pos23 dirdown
7. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos33 pos34 dirdown
8. move player1 pos33 pos23 dirleft
9. move player1 pos23 pos13 dirleft
10. move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown
