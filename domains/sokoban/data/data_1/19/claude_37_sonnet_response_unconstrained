Alright, I'm given a Sokoban-like puzzle where I need to move an agent (player1) to push a stone (stone1) to a goal location. 

Let's first understand the grid:
- It's a 5x5 grid, with positions labeled as pos11, pos12, etc., where the first number is the row and the second is the column.
- The agent (player1) starts at pos45 (4th row, 5th column).
- The stone (stone1) starts at pos32 (3rd row, 2nd column).
- The only goal location is pos31 (3rd row, 1st column).

The goal is to have stone1 at the goal location (pos31).

I need to use the given actions to achieve this goal. The actions are:
1. "move p l_from l_to d": Move agent p from location l_from to location l_to following direction d.
2. "pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": Push stone s from l_from to a goal location l_to.
3. "pushtonongoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": Push stone s from l_from to a non-goal location l_to.

Now, let's visually represent the grid to help me understand the problem better. Using the provided information:

```
1 . . . . .
2 . . . . .
3 G S . . .
4 . . . . P
5 . . . . .
```

Where:
- G is the goal location at pos31.
- S is the stone at pos32.
- P is the player at pos45.
- . are empty spaces.

To move the stone to the goal location pos31, the agent needs to push it from pos32 to pos31. 

The agent has to be on the opposite side of the stone from the goal. For stone1 to move from pos32 to pos31, the agent needs to be at pos33 to push the stone to the left.

Let's now determine a path for the agent to reach pos33.

From pos45, the agent can move to:
- pos44 (going up)
- pos35 (going left)
- pos55 (going right)

From pos35, the agent can move to:
- pos34 (going up)
- pos25 (going left)
- pos45 (going right)

From pos34, the agent can move to:
- pos33 (going up)

So, a path to pos33 is: 
pos45 -> pos35 -> pos34 -> pos33.

Once the agent is at pos33, it can push the stone from pos32 to pos31 (the goal location).

So, the plan would be:
1. Move the agent from pos45 to pos35 (going left).
2. Move the agent from pos35 to pos34 (going up).
3. Move the agent from pos34 to pos33 (going up).
4. Push the stone from pos32 to pos31 (going left, which is a goal location).

Let's now translate this plan to the required format:

1. "move player1 pos45 pos35 dirleft"
2. "move player1 pos35 pos34 dirup"
3. "move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup"
4. "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos32 pos31 dirleft"

Let's double-check:

Starting state:
- player1 is at pos45
- stone1 is at pos32

After Move 1 (move player1 pos45 pos35 dirleft):
- player1 is at pos35
- stone1 is at pos32

After Move 2 (move player1 pos35 pos34 dirup):
- player1 is at pos34
- stone1 is at pos32

After Move 3 (move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup):
- player1 is at pos33
- stone1 is at pos32

After Move 4 (pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos32 pos31 dirleft):
- player1 is at pos32 (this is an effect of the push)
- stone1 is at pos31 (the goal location)

This seems to be a valid and optimal plan to achieve the goal of getting stone1 to a goal location.

But wait, let's re-check the preconditions for the pushtogoal action:

"pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": You may only perform this action if 
(i) agent p is at location l_p, 
(ii) stone s is at location l_from, 
(iii) location l_to is clear, 
(iv) you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d, 
(v) you can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d, and 
(vi) location l_to is a goal location.

Let's check if Move 4 meets these preconditions:
- player1 is at pos33 (true)
- stone1 is at pos32 (true)
- pos31 is clear (true, as it's not mentioned in the original state as having anything in it)
- Can get from pos33 to pos32 following dirleft (need to check, but I assume it's true based on the grid)
- Can get from pos32 to pos31 following dirleft (need to check, but I assume it's true based on the grid)
- pos31 is a goal location (true, as stated in the original state)

Let me check the movement directions based on the information provided:

"You may move from location pos33 to location pos23 following direction dirleft"
"You may move from location pos33 to location pos43 following direction dirright"
"You may move from location pos33 to location pos32 following direction dirup"
"You may move from location pos33 to location pos34 following direction dirdown"

Here's something unexpected. The directions seem to be defined differently than I expected. Let's see:

- dirleft: Move to the left (decrease the first coordinate)
- dirright: Move to the right (increase the first coordinate)
- dirup: Move up (decrease the second coordinate)
- dirdown: Move down (increase the second coordinate)

This is different from my understanding, where I thought the first coordinate represented the row (from top to bottom) and the second represented the column (from left to right).

Let me reinterpret the grid and the directions:

```
  1 2 3 4 5
1 . . . . .
2 . . . . .
3 G S . . .
4 . . . . P
5 . . . . .
```

In this grid, the first number is the column and the second is the row. So, pos32 is the 3rd column and 2nd row, which corresponds to the stone's position.

Now, let's redo the planning:

To move the stone from pos32 to pos31, the agent needs to push it from the right. So, the agent needs to be at pos33 to push the stone to the left.

The correct interpretation of the directions:
- dirleft: Move to the left (decrease the first coordinate, e.g., pos32 to pos22)
- dirright: Move to the right (increase the first coordinate, e.g., pos32 to pos42)
- dirup: Move up (decrease the second coordinate, e.g., pos32 to pos31)
- dirdown: Move down (increase the second coordinate, e.g., pos32 to pos33)

Hmm, this still doesn't match the provided movement directions. Let me re-examine:

"You may move from location pos33 to location pos23 following direction dirleft"
"You may move from location pos33 to location pos43 following direction dirright"
"You may move from location pos33 to location pos32 following direction dirup"
"You may move from location pos33 to location pos34 following direction dirdown"

Ahh, I think I got it. The positions are labeled as posXY, where X is the column (left to right) and Y is the row (top to bottom). So pos33 means the 3rd column, 3rd row.

Let me redraw the grid:

```
  1 2 3 4 5
1 . . . . .
2 . . . . .
3 G S . . .
4 . . . . .
5 . . . . P
```

Here, the stone is at pos32 (column 3, row 2), the player is at pos45 (column 4, row 5), and the goal is at pos31 (column 3, row 1).

I got confused. Let me validate this once more with a specific example. From pos33, the direction dirleft takes us to pos23. That's moving from column 3 to column 2, which is indeed moving left. So, I think my second interpretation is correct.

```
  1 2 3 4 5
1 . . . . .
2 . . . . .
3 G S . . .
4 . . . . .
5 . . . . P
```

Hmm, this isn't right. Let me think again.

The part I'm struggling with is the interpretation of the "You may move from..." statements. Let me try a different approach to understand this.

From the statements, I can see that from pos33, using dirleft goes to pos23. This would mean that the first digit (3 in pos33) is decreasing, which could represent the horizontal coordinate.

Let me infer the grid structure based on the given movements:

"You may move from location pos33 to location pos23 following direction dirleft" (3,3 -> 2,3)
"You may move from location pos33 to location pos43 following direction dirright" (3,3 -> 4,3)
"You may move from location pos33 to location pos32 following direction dirup" (3,3 -> 3,2)
"You may move from location pos33 to location pos34 following direction dirdown" (3,3 -> 3,4)

This suggests a grid where:
- The first digit is the horizontal coordinate (left to right).
- The second digit is the vertical coordinate (top to bottom).

With this interpretation, the grid would look like:

```
  1 2 3 4 5
1 . . . . .
2 . . . . .
3 G S . . .
4 . . . . .
5 . . . . P
```

Where:
- G is the goal location at pos31 (column 3, row 1).
- S is the stone at pos32 (column 3, row 2).
- P is the player at pos45 (column 4, row 5).
- . are empty spaces.

Ok I'm going to draw a different grid:

```
  1 2 3 4 5
1 . . . . .
2 . . S . .
3 G . . . .
4 . . . . .
5 . . . P .
```

Now let me check:
 
The player is at pos45 (row 4, column 5).
The stone is at pos32 (row 3, column 2).
The goal is at pos31 (row 3, column 1).

But wait, this doesn't match the statement that pos31 is a goal location. In fact, the statement "pos31 is a goal location" suggests the first digit is the row and the second is the column.

Let me try another approach. I'll focus on the movement directions:

"You may move from location pos33 to location pos23 following direction dirleft"
"You may move from location pos33 to location pos43 following direction dirright"
"You may move from location pos33 to location pos32 following direction dirup"
"You may move from location pos33 to location pos34 following direction dirdown"

If I interpret these directions, from pos33:
- dirleft goes to pos23 (1st digit decreases)
- dirright goes to pos43 (1st digit increases)
- dirup goes to pos32 (2nd digit decreases)
- dirdown goes to pos34 (2nd digit increases)

This suggests:
- 1st digit is the column (left to right)
- 2nd digit is the row (top to bottom)

So, if posXY represents (row X, column Y), then the grid would be:

```
  1 2 3 4 5
1 . . G . .
2 . . S . .
3 . . . . .
4 . . . . .
5 . . . . P
```

Where:
- G is the goal location at pos31 (row 3, column 1).
- S is the stone at pos32 (row 3, column 2).
- P is the player at pos45 (row 4, column 5).

Hmm, that doesn't look right. Let me try again:

If posXY represents (column X, row Y), then the grid would be:

```
  1 2 3 4 5
1 . . . . .
2 . . . . .
3 G S . . .
4 . . . . .
5 . . . . P
```

Where:
- G is the goal location at pos31 (column 3, row 1).
- S is the stone at pos32 (column 3, row 2).
- P is the player at pos45 (column 4, row 5).

But wait, the movement from pos33:
- dirleft goes to pos23 (which would be to the left in this grid interpretation)
- dirright goes to pos43 (which would be to the right in this grid interpretation)
- dirup goes to pos32 (which would be up in this grid interpretation)
- dirdown goes to pos34 (which would be down in this grid interpretation)

This matches the directions, so I believe my interpretation is correct.

With this interpretation, the plan would be:

To move the stone from pos32 to pos31 (the goal), the agent needs to push it from below. So, the agent needs to be at pos33 to push the stone up.

To reach pos33 from pos45, the agent can:
1. Move from pos45 to pos44 (move left)
2. Move from pos44 to pos43 (move left)
3. Move from pos43 to pos33 (move up)
4. Push the stone from pos32 to pos31 (move up, which is to a goal location)

Let's translate this plan to the required format:

1. "move player1 pos45 pos44 dirleft"
2. "move player1 pos44 pos43 dirleft"
3. "move player1 pos43 pos33 dirup"
4. "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos32 pos31 dirup"

Let me double-check if these preconditions are met:

For Move 1 (move player1 pos45 pos44 dirleft):
(i) player1 is at pos45 (true)
(ii) pos44 is clear (true)
(iii) Can move from pos45 to pos44 following dirleft (need to check, but I believe it's true based on the grid)

Hmm, the direction "You may move from location pos45 to location pos44 following direction dirup". So, the move should be:
1. "move player1 pos45 pos44 dirup"

For Move 2 (move player1 pos44 pos43 dirleft):
(i) player1 is at pos44 (true after move 1)
(ii) pos43 is clear (true)
(iii) Can move from pos44 to pos43 following dirleft (need to check, but I believe it's true based on the grid)

Let me check: "You may move from location pos44 to location pos43 following direction dirup". So, the move should be:
2. "move player1 pos44 pos43 dirup"

For Move 3 (move player1 pos43 pos33 dirup):
(i) player1 is at pos43 (true after move 2)
(ii) pos33 is clear (true)
(iii) Can move from pos43 to pos33 following dirup (need to check, but I believe it's true based on the grid)

Let me check: "You may move from location pos43 to location pos33 following direction dirleft".

Wait, something seems off. Let me reinterpret the grid again based on the actual movement statements:

"You may move from location pos45 to location pos35 following direction dirleft"
"You may move from location pos45 to location pos55 following direction dirright"
"You may move from location pos45 to location pos44 following direction dirup"

From pos45:
- dirleft goes to pos35 (1st digit decreases)
- dirright goes to pos55 (1st digit increases)
- dirup goes to pos44 (2nd digit decreases)

If the 1st digit corresponds to row and the 2nd to column:
- dirleft would mean move up (or decrease row)
- dirright would mean move down (or increase row)
- dirup would mean move left (or decrease column)

But this doesn't make sense with the direction names.

If the 1st digit corresponds to column and the 2nd to row:
- dirleft would mean move left (or decrease column)
- dirright would mean move right (or increase column)
- dirup would mean move up (or decrease row)

This makes more sense. 

So, posXY means (column X, row Y). In this representation:
- G is the goal location at pos31 (column 3, row 1).
- S is the stone at pos32 (column 3, row 2).
- P is the player at pos45 (column 4, row 5).

With this interpretation, let me redo the plan. To push the stone from pos32 to pos31, the agent needs to be at pos33 (directly below the stone).


To reach pos33 from pos45, the agent can:
1. "move player1 pos45 pos35 dirleft" (move left)
2. "move player1 pos35 pos34 dirup" (move up)
3. "move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup" (move up)
4. "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos32 pos31 dirup" (push up)


Let me make one more check for move 4:
- player1 is at pos33 (after move 3, true)
- stone1 is at pos32 (true)
- pos31 is clear (true)
- Can get from pos33 to pos32 following dirup (true)
- Can get from pos32 to pos31 following dirup (true)
- pos31 is a goal location (stated as true in the original state)

Ok here's the final solution:
1. "move player1 pos45 pos35 dirleft"
2. "move player1 pos35 pos34 dirup"
3. "move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup"
4. "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos32 pos31 dirup"

Now I want to verify once more by looking at the movement statements:
"You may move from location pos33 to location pos23 following direction dirleft"
"You may move from location pos33 to location pos43 following direction dirright"
"You may move from location pos33 to location pos32 following direction dirup"
"You may move from location pos33 to location pos34 following direction dirdown"

From pos33:
dirleft (pos23): First digit changes from 3 to 2 (left)
dirright (pos43): First digit changes from 3 to 4 (right)
dirup (pos32): Second digit changes from 3 to 2 (up)
dirdown (pos34): Second digit changes from 3 to 4 (down)

This confirms the grid as a column (left to right) by row (top to bottom) representation. So, my plan is correct.

Ok, I think I have the correct grid interpretation now. Let's trace the solution again to make sure it's optimal:

Starting from pos45, the agent needs to move to pos33 to push the stone from pos32 to pos31. The most direct path is:
1. "move player1 pos45 pos35 dirleft"
2. "move player1 pos35 pos34 dirup"
3. "move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup"
4. "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos32 pos31 dirup"

After move 4, stone1 will be at pos31, which is a goal location. This completes the puzzle.

But wait, I just want to check something; looking at the starting state again: "stone1 is at location pos32", "Location pos32 is clear"

It seems like there's a contradiction in the initial state description. How can the stone be at pos32 and pos32 be clear at the same time? 

Hmm, this is a bit concerning. Let me double-check the original state:

"player1 is at location pos45"
"stone1 is at location pos32"
"Location pos11 is clear"
...
"Location pos32 is clear"
...
"Location pos45 is clear"

It's odd that it says both that the stone is at pos32 and that pos32 is clear. This might be an oversight in the problem statement. For the purposes of my planning, I'll assume that pos32 is occupied by the stone (since that's consistent with the goal to move the stone to a goal location). But it's worth noting this inconsistency.

Actually, looking at all the locations that are supposedly clear, it includes both pos32 (where the stone is) and pos45 (where the player is). This suggests that maybe the "clear" predicate means something different from what I initially thought or there's an oversight.

For the planning, I'll operate under the assumption that pos32 is occupied by the stone and pos45 is occupied by the player, as stated explicitly.

Let me trace the solution once more to make sure it's valid:

1. "move player1 pos45 pos35 dirleft" (from column 4, row 5 to column 3, row 5)
2. "move player1 pos35 pos34 dirup" (from column 3, row 5 to column 3, row 4)
3. "move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup" (from column 3, row 4 to column 3, row 3)
4. "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos32 pos31 dirup" (push the stone from column 3, row 2 to column 3, row 1)

Since there are no constraints mentioned in the problem statement, this seems to be the optimal plan.
