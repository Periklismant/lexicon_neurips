Alright, I'm given a Sokoban-like puzzle where I need to move a stone to a goal location.

First, let's understand the grid layout:
- We have a 5x5 grid (positions pos11 to pos55).
- The player (player1) starts at position pos14.
- There's one stone (stone1) at position pos43.
- The goal location is pos54.

The task is to move the stone to the goal location. I can perform the following actions:
1. Move the player.
2. Push the stone to a goal location.
3. Push the stone to a non-goal location.

Let's visualize the grid to better understand the problem. I'm using "P" to denote the player, "S" to denote the stone, "G" to denote the goal, and "." to denote an empty cell.

```
. . . P .
. . . . .
. . . . .
. . S . .
. . . G .
```

So the player is at pos14, the stone is at pos43, and the goal is at pos54.

Now, let's think about the plan:

1. First, the player needs to get to a position adjacent to the stone.
2. Then, the player needs to push the stone towards the goal.

Let's plan the player's movement to get to a position adjacent to the stone. The player is at pos14 and needs to get to a position adjacent to pos43, which could be pos33, pos42, pos44, or pos53.

Looking at the initial state, the player's movement is described by statements like "You may move from location posXX to location posYY following direction dirZZ". This means I can move from posXX to posYY in the direction dirZZ.

Let's plan the path for the player to reach, say, pos33, which is above the stone:

pos14 -> pos24 -> pos34 -> pos33 (moving right, right, up).

Now, let's plan the push. The stone is at pos43 and needs to be pushed to pos54. So:

pos33 (player) + pos43 (stone) => pos43 (player) + pos44 (stone) (push down).
pos43 (player) + pos44 (stone) => pos44 (player) + pos54 (stone) (push right).

Now, the stone is at the goal location (pos54).

Let's formalize this plan:

1. move player1 pos14 pos24 dirright
2. move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright
3. move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup
4. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos43 pos44 dirdown
5. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos44 pos54 dirright

Actually, there's a slight issue with the problem statement. It says "Location pos14 is clear" and "Location pos43 is clear" at the end of the initial state description, but these locations should not be clear as they have the player and the stone, respectively. Let me double-check the actions and effects to ensure I understand them correctly.

Alright, after reviewing, I think the issue is in the problem statement. The player and the stone should make their respective locations not clear. But, I'll proceed with the understanding that the player is at pos14 and the stone is at pos43.

Another observation: the action "pushtogoal" requires the destination to be a goal location, and "pushtonongoal" requires the destination to not be a goal location. Since pos54 is the only goal location, I can only push the stone to pos54 using "pushtogoal".

Now, let's go through the plan one more time. I'm trying to find a way to get to the stone and then push it to the goal.

The player is at pos14 and the stone is at pos43.

One route to get to the side of the stone is:

pos14 -> pos24 -> pos34 -> pos33 (moving right, right, up).

Then:

pos33 (player) + pos43 (stone) => pos43 (player) + pos44 (stone) (push down).
pos43 (player) + pos44 (stone) => pos44 (player) + pos54 (stone) (push right).

Let's formalize this plan:

```
1. move player1 pos14 pos24 dirright
2. move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright
3. move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup
4. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos43 pos44 dirdown
5. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos44 pos54 dirright
```

However, I think there's a mistake in the problem statement. The line "Location pos14 is clear" seems to be wrong, since player1 is at that location. Similarly for "Location pos43 is clear", since stone1 is at that location. But I'll assume these are mistakes and that player1 is at pos14 and stone1 is at pos43.

Wait, there's a possible issue with the action descriptions. During a push, it says the player moves to the location where the stone was. This means that after pushing the stone from, for example, pos43 to pos44, the player will end up at pos43. So, the positions after the pushes would be:

pos33 (player) + pos43 (stone) => pos43 (player) + pos44 (stone) (push down).
pos43 (player) + pos44 (stone) => pos44 (player) + pos54 (stone) (push right).

This still leads to the expected result: the stone at the goal (pos54) and the player at pos44.

However, I realized that I misinterpreted the problem initially. I was thinking of "pushing down" as moving the stone from a position to the position below it. However, in the action description, the direction indicates the direction the player moves to reach the stone, not the direction the stone is pushed.

So, to clarify:
- "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos43 pos44 dirdown" means the player is at pos33, the stone is at pos43, and the player is pushing the stone to pos44. The "dirdown" indicates the player is moving down from pos33 to reach pos43 and then pushing the stone from pos43 to pos44. After the push, the player will be at pos43 and the stone will be at pos44.

- "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos44 pos54 dirright" means the player is at pos43, the stone is at pos44, and the player is pushing the stone to pos54 (which is a goal location). The "dirright" indicates the player is moving right from pos43 to reach pos44 and then pushing the stone from pos44 to pos54. After the push, the player will be at pos44 and the stone will be at pos54.

Let's revisit the plan one more time:

The player is at pos14, and the stone is at pos43. I actually need to get to pos33 (above the stone) and push the stone down to pos44.

Then, I need to get to pos43 (which I'll already be at after the first push) and push the stone right to the goal at pos54.

Here's the plan:

```
1. move player1 pos14 pos24 dirright
2. move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright
3. move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup
4. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos43 pos44 dirdown
5. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos44 pos54 dirright
```

Let's double-check if this plan satisfies the required conditions:

Initial state:
- player1 is at pos14
- stone1 is at pos43
- pos54 is a goal location

After step 1:
- player1 is at pos24
- stone1 is at pos43

After step 2:
- player1 is at pos34
- stone1 is at pos43

After step 3:
- player1 is at pos33
- stone1 is at pos43

After step 4:
- player1 is at pos43
- stone1 is at pos44

After step 5:
- player1 is at pos44
- stone1 is at pos54 (which is a goal location)

So, the stone is at a goal location, which is our objective.

Let's check if each action's preconditions are met:

Step 1: move player1 pos14 pos24 dirright
- player1 is at pos14 (true in the initial state)
- pos24 is clear (true in the initial state)
- You may move from pos14 to pos24 following dirright (true in the initial state)

Step 2: move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright
- player1 is at pos24 (true after step 1)
- pos34 is clear (true in the initial state)
- You may move from pos24 to pos34 following dirright (true in the initial state)

Step 3: move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup
- player1 is at pos34 (true after step 2)
- pos33 is clear (true in the initial state)
- You may move from pos34 to pos33 following dirup (true in the initial state)

Step 4: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos43 pos44 dirdown
- player1 is at pos33 (true after step 3)
- stone1 is at pos43 (true in the initial state)
- pos44 is clear (true in the initial state)
- You may move from pos33 to pos43 following dirdown (true in the initial state)
- You may move from pos43 to pos44 following dirdown (true in the initial state)
- pos44 is not a goal location (true in the initial state)

Step 5: pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos44 pos54 dirright
- player1 is at pos43 (true after step 4)
- stone1 is at pos44 (true after step 4)
- pos54 is clear (true in the initial state)
- You may move from pos43 to pos44 following dirright (true in the initial state)
- You may move from pos44 to pos54 following dirright (true in the initial state)
- pos54 is a goal location (true in the initial state)

All preconditions are met, so the plan is valid.

Let's also check if it's optimal, meaning there's no shorter plan. 

In this case, we need to move the player from pos14 to pos33 and then perform two push actions. It seems there isn't a shorter path for the player to reach pos33 from pos14, and we need exactly two push actions (one to get the stone to pos44 and one to get it to the goal). Therefore, the plan seems optimal.

Let's formalize the final plan:

```
move player1 pos14 pos24 dirright
move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright
move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos43 pos44 dirdown
pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos44 pos54 dirright
```

Actually, I just realized that there's a slightly shorter path to move the agent from pos14 to pos33:
pos14 -> pos13 -> pos23 -> pos33 (moving up, right, right).

This means the optimal plan would be:

```
move player1 pos14 pos13 dirup
move player1 pos13 pos23 dirright
move player1 pos23 pos33 dirright
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos43 pos44 dirdown
pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos44 pos54 dirright
```

Let me double-check if this alternative plan is valid:

Step 1: move player1 pos14 pos13 dirup
- player1 is at pos14 (true in the initial state)
- pos13 is clear (true in the initial state)
- You may move from pos14 to pos13 following dirup (true in the initial state)

Wait, I made a mistake in interpreting the directions. The directions in this problem are not the standard grid directions. They are specified in the problem as:
- dirdown: Moving from upper position to lower position (moving down the grid).
- dirup: Moving from lower position to upper position (moving up the grid).
- dirleft: Moving from right position to left position (moving left across the grid).
- dirright: Moving from left position to right position (moving right across the grid).

With this understanding, to go from pos14 to pos13, we would move in the direction dirup (since we're going from position 14 to position 13).

However, looking at the initial state, it says:

"You may move from location pos14 to location pos13 following direction dirup"

This doesn't align with the directions as I understand them, since moving from 14 to 13 would be moving up (or decreasing the second digit, which would be dirup).

Let me study the directions again based on the statements in the initial state.

From "You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright", it seems dirright means moving from a position with the first digit 1 to a position with the first digit 2. Similarly, from "You may move from location pos11 to location pos12 following direction dirdown", it seems dirdown means moving from a position with the second digit 1 to a position with the second digit 2.

Given the grid positions:

```
11 12 13 14 15
21 22 23 24 25
31 32 33 34 35
41 42 43 44 45
51 52 53 54 55
```

- dirup: Moving from a position with a higher second digit to a position with a lower second digit (moving up the grid).
- dirdown: Moving from a position with a lower second digit to a position with a higher second digit (moving down the grid).
- dirleft: Moving from a position with a higher first digit to a position with a lower first digit (moving left across the grid).
- dirright: Moving from a position with a lower first digit to a position with a higher first digit (moving right across the grid).

With this understanding, let's revisit the paths:

From pos14 to pos33:
- First, move from pos14 to pos24 using dirright.
- Then, move from pos24 to pos34 using dirright.
- Finally, move from pos34 to pos33 using dirup.

This path requires 3 moves. Is there a shorter path? Let's see if we can reach pos33 from pos14 in fewer than 3 moves by considering other routes:

- pos14 -> pos24 -> pos23 -> pos33: 3 moves (dirright, dirup, dirright).
- pos14 -> pos13 -> pos23 -> pos33: 3 moves (dirup, dirright, dirright).
- pos14 -> pos13 -> pos12 -> pos22 -> pos32 -> pos33: 5 moves (dirup, dirup, dirright, dirright, dirdown).

It seems the shortest path requires 3 moves, so our initial plan with 3 moves to reach pos33 is optimal.

Thus, the optimal plan is:

```
move player1 pos14 pos24 dirright
move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright
move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos43 pos44 dirdown
pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos44 pos54 dirright
```

Let's double-check the final plan one more time:

From the initial state:
- player1 is at pos14
- stone1 is at pos43

Step 1: move player1 pos14 pos24 dirright
After this, player1 is at pos24 and stone1 is still at pos43.

Step 2: move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright
After this, player1 is at pos34 and stone1 is still at pos43.

Step 3: move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup
After this, player1 is at pos33 and stone1 is still at pos43.

Step 4: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos43 pos44 dirdown
After this, player1 is at pos43 and stone1 is at pos44.

Step 5: pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos44 pos54 dirright
After this, player1 is at pos44 and stone1 is at pos54 (which is a goal location).

This plan achieves our goal of moving the stone to a goal location, and it seems to be optimal. There's no shorter path for the player to reach pos33 from pos14, and we need exactly two push actions to get the stone to the goal.

So, the final answer is:

```
move player1 pos14 pos24 dirright
move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright
move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos43 pos44 dirdown
pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos44 pos54 dirright
```
