Okay, let's try to figure out how to solve this planning problem. The goal is to get stone1, which is at pos43, to a goal location. The only goal location mentioned is pos54. So, I need to move stone1 from pos43 to pos54. The agent starts at pos14. 

First, I need to figure out the path for the agent to reach pos43 so they can push the stone. Let me look at the movement possibilities. The agent is at pos14. From the initial state's movement options, pos14 can move to pos24 (right), pos13 (up), or pos15 (down). But since the stone is at pos43, which is in the fourth row and third column, maybe the best path is to go down or right first?

Wait, pos14 is row 1, column4. To get to pos43 (row4, column3), the agent needs to move down multiple times. Let's see the possible moves. Let me map the grid:

Rows are 1 (top) to 5 (bottom), columns 1 to 5. So pos14 is row1, column4. Pos43 is row4, column3. The goal pos54 is row5, column4.

So the agent is at pos14. To get to pos43, they need to go down to pos24, then pos34, then pos44, but wait, the stone is at pos43. Hmm. Let me check the allowed movements.

Looking at the movement connections:

From pos14, the agent can move right to pos24. Then from pos24, can they go right to pos34? Let's check the movement list. The movement from pos24 includes dirright to pos34. So pos24 to pos34 is allowed. Then pos34 can move right to pos44. Then from pos44, can they move left or up? Wait, the stone is at pos43. So the agent needs to get to a position adjacent to pos43 to push it.

Pos43 is at row4, column3. The adjacent positions would be pos33 (up), pos42 (left), pos44 (right?), or pos53 (down). Wait, the directions might be a bit different. Let me check the movement options around pos43.

Looking at the movement from pos43: You can go left to pos33 (dirleft?), right to pos53 (dirright?), up to pos42 (dirup?), or down to pos44 (dirdown? Wait, let me check the actual movement entries.

From the given movements: "You may move from location pos43 to location pos33 following direction dirleft" — so dirleft from pos43 is to pos33. "You may move from location pos43 to location pos53 following direction dirright" — so right to pos53. "You may move from location pos43 to location pos42 following direction dirup" — up to pos42. "You may move from location pos43 to location pos44 following direction dirdown" — down to pos44.

Wait, that's interesting. So directions are a bit relative. So to push the stone from pos43 to pos54 (which is row5, column4), the stone needs to move from pos43 to pos44, then pos44 to pos54. Because pos44 can move right to pos54 (since direction dirright from pos44 to pos54 is allowed. Because in the movement list, "You may move from location pos44 to location pos54 following direction dirright". So that's a possible path.

So the plan would be:

1. Agent moves from pos14 to pos24 (dirright), then to pos34 (dirright from pos24), then to pos44 (dirright from pos34). Then, from pos44, the agent can move to pos43 (dirleft?), but wait, can the agent move from pos44 to pos43? Let's check the movement list. Looking for pos44's movements: "You may move from location pos44 to location pos34 following direction dirleft", "You may move from location pos44 to location pos54 following direction dirright", "You may move from location pos44 to location pos43 following direction dirup", "You may move from location pos44 to location pos45 following direction dirdown". Oh, so from pos44, moving dirup would take the agent to pos43. So once the agent is at pos44, they can move up to pos43. But wait, pos43 is currently occupied by the stone. So moving there directly isn't possible unless the stone is moved first. Wait, no. The agent can't move into a location that's not clear. Since the stone is at pos43, which is not clear (because it's occupied by the stone), the agent can't move there unless the stone is pushed. Wait, but the initial state says "Location pos43 is clear". Wait, wait, looking back at the original state: "Location pos43 is clear" — no, wait, the original state says "stone1 is at location pos43" and "Location pos43 is clear". Wait, that seems contradictory. Because if a stone is at pos43, then pos43 is not clear. Wait, maybe there's a mistake here. Let me check again.

Original state:

"stone1 is at location pos43"

"Location pos43 is clear"

Hmm, that can't be right. If the stone is at pos43, then pos43 is not clear. But according to the problem statement, it's given as both. That must be a mistake. Wait, perhaps the problem statement has a typo. Let me check again.

Looking at the original state:

The original state includes:

"player1 is at location pos14"

"stone1 is at location pos43"

"Location pos11 is clear"

... (many locations listed as clear, including pos43: "Location pos43 is clear")

Wait, that's conflicting. Because if stone1 is at pos43, then pos43 is not clear. So perhaps this is an error. But maybe in the problem's context, "clear" means no agent is there, but stones are allowed? But according to the action preconditions, for example, "move" requires that the destination location is clear. So "clear" probably means that there's no agent or stone in that location. Therefore, having stone1 at pos43 and pos43 being clear is impossible. This suggests that there's a mistake in the problem statement. But since I have to work with what's given, perhaps there's a misunderstanding.

Alternatively, maybe "clear" refers to the presence of the agent. Wait, looking at the effects of actions: when you move, the agent leaves the previous location, making it clear, and occupies the new location. Similarly, pushing a stone moves the stone and the agent. So perhaps "clear" refers to the agent's presence, not the stone's. That would make sense. So a location is clear if the agent is not there, but stones can be present. But the move action's preconditions require that the destination is clear (i.e., no agent there), but stones are allowed. Hmm, but in that case, how do you move to a location with a stone? That would not be possible. So perhaps "clear" means that neither agent nor stone is present. But the problem states that in the original state, pos43 has stone1 and is clear. That's a contradiction. Therefore, this must be an error. But since I have to proceed, perhaps I should assume that "clear" refers to the agent not being present, and stones can be in a location even if it's considered "clear". That might be possible. So in the problem's terms, a location is clear if the agent is not there, regardless of stones. So when moving, the destination must be clear (agent not present), but stones can be in the location. However, for the pushtogoal and pushtonongoal actions, the stone's location is considered. So, perhaps the "Location pos43 is clear" in the original state is a mistake, but I have to proceed.

Alternatively, maybe "clear" means that there's no stone in the location. But that also conflicts because the agent's location is not considered for "clear". Hmm. This is confusing. Let's check the preconditions for the actions. For the move action: (ii) location l_to is clear. So if the agent is moving to a location with a stone, that's not allowed. Because the stone is present, making the location not clear. Therefore, in the original state, pos43 has a stone, so it's not clear, but the problem says "Location pos43 is clear". That's a contradiction. Therefore, there's an error in the problem statement. However, given that the problem states both "stone1 is at pos43" and "pos43 is clear", perhaps the correct interpretation is that "clear" refers to the agent's presence, not the stone's. So a location is clear if the agent is not there, even if there's a stone. That way, the initial state is possible. So when moving, the destination just needs to not have the agent. But when pushing a stone, the stone's location is considered separately. 

In that case, the agent can move to a location that has a stone, but that doesn't make sense because the stone would block the agent. But according to the problem's preconditions, maybe "clear" only refers to the agent's presence, not the stone's. So even if there's a stone, as long as the agent isn't there, it's considered clear. That seems odd, but perhaps that's how it's defined here. So, in the original state, pos43 has a stone but is considered clear because the agent isn't there. Then, the agent can move into pos43 as long as it's clear (i.e., agent not present). But that's not possible because moving into a location with a stone would require the stone to be moved first. But according to the problem's initial state, the stone is at pos43 and pos43 is clear, which suggests that "clear" doesn't account for stones. So this is a problem, but I have to proceed.

Alternatively, maybe the problem statement intended that pos43 is not clear, but there's a typo. For example, maybe the stone is at pos43 and pos43 is not clear, but the original state says it is. That would be an error, but given that, perhaps the correct approach is to ignore that inconsistency and proceed. So, assuming that pos43 is not clear (due to the stone), the agent cannot move there. Therefore, to push the stone from pos43 to pos44, the agent needs to be at a position adjacent to pos43 in the direction opposite to the push direction. 

Wait, let's think about pushing. For example, to push the stone from pos43 to pos44 (down direction), the agent needs to be at pos42 (since the direction from pos42 to pos43 is dirdown). Wait, no. Let me look at the direction definitions. The directions are dirup, dirdown, dirleft, dirright. For example, moving from pos43 to pos42 is dirup, as per the movement list: "You may move from location pos43 to location pos42 following direction dirup". So dirup from pos43 leads to pos42. So if the agent is at pos42 and wants to push the stone from pos43 to pos44 (dirdown), that would require that the agent is at pos42, which is adjacent to pos43 (since pos42 is up from pos43). Wait, but to push the stone down (from pos43 to pos44), the agent must be at pos43 and push it down, but that's not possible. Because the stone is at pos43. So the agent can't be there. Instead, the agent must be at a position adjacent to pos43 in the direction opposite to the push. For example, to push the stone down (from pos43 to pos44), the agent needs to be at pos42 (up from pos43) and then push down. Wait, but how does the pushing work? Let me check the preconditions for pushtogoal and pushtonongoal.

The "pushtogoal" action's preconditions are: (i) agent is at l_p, (ii) stone is at l_from, (iii) l_to is clear, (iv) can move from l_p to l_from following direction d, (v) can move from l_from to l_to following direction d, and (vi) l_to is a goal location.

So for example, to push the stone from l_from (pos43) to l_to (pos44) with direction d (dirdown), the agent must be at l_p (some position where moving from l_p to l_from via direction d is possible). Wait, no: (iv) you can get from l_p to l_from following direction d. So direction d must be the direction from l_p to l_from. Then, (v) you can get from l_from to l_to following direction d. So the same direction d must be applicable from l_p to l_from and from l_from to l_to. So the direction is consistent. 

So, for example, if the agent is at pos42, and wants to push the stone from pos43 to pos44, direction would have to be dirdown. Because from l_p (pos42), moving dirdown to l_from (pos43) is allowed (since "You may move from location pos42 to location pos43 following direction dirdown"). Then from l_from (pos43), moving dirdown to l_to (pos44) is allowed ("You may move from location pos43 to location pos44 following direction dirdown"). So the direction here is dirdown. So the action would be "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos43 pos44 dirdown". But wait, pos44 is not a goal location. The only goal location is pos54. So pushing to pos44 isn't helpful. Therefore, the stone needs to be pushed to pos54. Let's see how to get there.

Pos43 to pos44 (dirdown), then pos44 to pos54 (dirright). Because from pos44, moving dirright leads to pos54. So to push the stone from pos44 to pos54, the agent needs to be at pos43 (since direction dirright from pos43 to pos44 isn't a valid move. Wait, no. Wait, direction dirright from pos44 to pos54: yes, the movement list says "You may move from location pos44 to location pos54 following direction dirright". So to push the stone from pos44 to pos54 (dirright), the agent must be at a position from which they can move to pos44 via dirright. That would be pos34 (since moving dirright from pos34 to pos44 is allowed). Or wait, no. Let's think again. The agent's location l_p must be such that they can move from l_p to l_from (pos44 in this case) via direction d (dirright). So for example, if the agent is at pos43, moving dirright to pos44 is allowed? Let me check: "You may move from location pos43 to location pos44 following direction dirdown". No, that's dirdown. Dirright from pos43 is to pos53. So to push the stone from pos44 to pos54 (dirright), the agent must be at a position that allows moving dirright to pos44. That would be pos43? Because dirright from pos43 is to pos53. Wait, no. Wait, pos44 is in row4, column4. To move dirright to pos54 (row5?), no. Wait, maybe I'm getting the coordinates wrong. Let me clarify the positions:

The positions are named posXY, where X is the row and Y is the column. For example, pos11 is row1, column1; pos12 is row1, column2; pos21 is row2, column1, etc. So, pos44 is row4, column4. Moving dirright from pos44 would go to column5, but pos45 is row4, column5. Wait, no. Wait, direction dirright might correspond to moving to the next column in the same row. So pos44 (row4, column4) moving dirright would go to pos45 (row4, column5). But the movement list says: "You may move from location pos44 to location pos54 following direction dirright". Wait, that can't be. Because pos54 is row5, column4. So moving dirright from pos44 would increase the column, but pos44 is column4, so dirright would go to column5 (pos45), but the movement says pos44 to pos54 (row5, column4). That's confusing. So perhaps the directions are not as I thought. Maybe dirright and dirleft correspond to east and west, and dirup and dirdown correspond to north and south. So in that case, moving dirright from pos44 (row4, column4) would go to column5, row4: pos45. But according to the movement list, "You may move from location pos44 to location pos54 following direction dirright". That suggests that dirright from pos44 leads to pos54 (row5, column4), which is south. That doesn't make sense. So perhaps the directions are different. Let me check the movement entries again.

Looking at the movement list:

From pos44: "You may move from location pos44 to location pos34 following direction dirleft", "You may move from location pos44 to location pos54 following direction dirright", "You may move from location pos44 to location pos43 following direction dirup", "You may move from location pos44 to location pos45 following direction dirdown".

So dirright from pos44 leads to pos54. Pos54 is row5, column4. So moving dirright from pos44 (row4, column4) to pos54 (row5, column4) is moving down a row. That suggests that dirright is actually south, and dirleft is north? Or perhaps the directions are mislabeled. This is a problem. Because the directions are named dirright, dirleft, dirup, dirdown, but their actual movement might not correspond to the intuitive directions. 

For example, moving dirright from pos44 to pos54 (row5, column4) is moving down a row. So dirright is actually south. Similarly, moving dirleft from pos44 to pos34 (row3, column4) is moving up a row. So dirleft is north. Dirup and dirdown might correspond to west and east? Let's check another example.

From pos43: movement options are to pos33 (dirleft), pos53 (dirright), pos42 (dirup), pos44 (dirdown). pos43 is row4, column3. pos33 is row3, column3 (dirleft), pos53 is row5, column3 (dirright). pos42 is row4, column2 (dirup), pos44 is row4, column4 (dirdown). So dirleft from pos43 is to row3 (up), dirright to row5 (down). dirup is to column2 (left?), dirdown to column4 (right). This suggests that:

- dirleft: move up a row (same column)
- dirright: move down a row (same column)
- dirup: move left a column (same row)
- dirdown: move right a column (same row)

Wait, that seems contradictory. For example, from pos43 (row4, column3):

- dirleft: pos33 (row3, column3) → moving up a row.
- dirright: pos53 (row5, column3) → moving down a row.
- dirup: pos42 (row4, column2) → moving left a column.
- dirdown: pos44 (row4, column4) → moving right a column.

So the directions are:

- dirleft: up (decrease row)
- dirright: down (increase row)
- dirup: left (decrease column)
- dirdown: right (increase column)

That's a bit counterintuitive, but that's how the movement is defined here. So directions are as follows:

- dirleft: north (up in rows)
- dirright: south (down in rows)
- dirup: west (left in columns)
- dirdown: east (right in columns)

This is crucial to understand. So, when the direction is dirright, it's moving down a row. When it's dirleft, moving up a row. Dirup moves left in the same row, and dirdown moves right in the same row.

So, given that, let's re-examine the path.

The agent starts at pos14 (row1, column4). The goal is to push stone1 from pos43 (row4, column3) to pos54 (row5, column4), which is a goal location.

So the stone is at row4, column3. To push it to pos54 (row5, column4), we need to move it south (dirright) to row5, column3 (pos53?), then east (dirdown) to column4? Or perhaps there's a more direct path.

Wait, pos43 is row4, column3. To reach pos54 (row5, column4), the stone needs to move south (dirright) to row5, column3 (pos53), then east (dirdown) to pos54 (row5, column4). But pos53 is not a goal location. Alternatively, can the stone be pushed east first to pos44 (row4, column4) via dirdown (east), then south (dirright) to pos54 (row5, column4). That seems better because pos44 to pos54 is dirright (south). So the path would be:

pos43 → pos44 (dirdown, east to column4) → pos54 (dirright, south to row5).

But wait, pushing from pos43 to pos44 requires the agent to be in a position where they can push east (dirdown direction). So to push from pos43 to pos44 (dirdown, east), the agent needs to be at pos43's west (column2) in the same row. Because dirup from pos43 is west (column2). So agent at pos42 (row4, column2), then push east (dirdown) to pos43 to pos44. Wait, no. Let me think again.

To push the stone from pos43 to pos44 (dirdown, which is east), the agent must be in the position west of pos43 (since pushing east requires the agent to be to the west of the stone). So the agent needs to be at pos43's west, which is pos42 (row4, column2). Because from pos42, moving east (dirdown) would take them to pos43. Then, pushing east (dirdown) from pos43 to pos44.

Wait, but according to the action's preconditions for pushtogoal:

The agent must be at l_p (pos42), and the stone is at l_from (pos43). Then, moving from l_p (pos42) to l_from (pos43) via direction d (which in this case would be dirdown, since moving from pos42 to pos43 is direction dirdown. Because from pos42's movement options: "You may move from location pos42 to location pos43 following direction dirdown". Since dirdown corresponds to east (right in columns). So direction d is dirdown. Then, from l_from (pos43) to l_to (pos44) via dirdown (east) is allowed, as per movement list: "You may move from location pos43 to location pos44 following direction dirdown".

So the action would be "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos43 pos44 dirdown". But pos44 is not a goal location. So after pushing to pos44, the stone is there. Then, we need to push it again to pos54, which is a goal location. 

To push from pos44 to pos54 (dirright, which is south), the agent needs to be north of pos44. Because dirright is south. So the agent must be at pos34 (row3, column4), since moving dirright (south) from pos34 to pos44 is allowed. Then, pushing dirright from pos44 to pos54 would require the agent to be at pos44's north (pos34) and then push south. 

But wait, the agent is at pos44 after pushing the stone from pos43 to pos44. Because after pushing, the agent moves to l_from (pos43) and the stone moves to l_to (pos44). So after the first push, the agent is at pos43. Then, the agent needs to move to pos34 to push the stone south to pos54.

Wait, after the first push (pushtonongoal to pos44), the agent is at pos43. Then, to push from pos44 to pos54, the agent needs to be north of pos44 (pos34). So the agent needs to move from pos43 to pos34. How?

From pos43, possible movements: dirleft (north) to pos33 (row3, column3), dirright (south) to pos53 (row5, column3), dirup (west) to pos42 (row4, column2), or dirdown (east) to pos44 (row4, column4). But pos44 is occupied by the stone now, so moving there would require it to be clear. But according to the problem's definition, clear refers to the agent not being there. So if the stone is at pos44, but the agent isn't, then pos44 is clear? No, that can't be. Because the stone is there. Wait, the preconditions for the move action require that the destination is clear. If "clear" means no agent, then even if there's a stone, it's allowed. But that's not possible. Because the stone would block the agent. But according to the problem's original state, pos43 has a stone and is clear. So perhaps in this problem, "clear" only refers to the agent's presence, not the stone's. Therefore, the agent can move into a location with a stone, which doesn't make sense. But given the problem's contradictory initial state, we have to proceed with that assumption.

But in reality, that's impossible. So perhaps there's a misunderstanding. Let me re-examine the original state's "clear" locations. The original state lists "Location pos43 is clear" but also "stone1 is at location pos43". This suggests that "clear" refers to the absence of the agent, not the stone. So a location can have a stone and still be considered clear. Therefore, when the agent wants to move to a location, they can do so even if there's a stone there. But that's not realistic. However, given the problem's description, that's how it's defined. 

So, after pushing the stone to pos44, the agent is at pos43. Then, the agent can move from pos43 to pos44 (dirdown, east) because pos44 is clear (no agent there, even though there's a stone). But when the agent moves there, the stone is still there. That would be a problem because then the agent and stone would be in the same location, which isn't allowed. So this suggests that the initial problem statement has an error. But since I have to proceed, perhaps I should ignore that and follow the preconditions as given.

Alternatively, maybe "clear" means that neither agent nor stone is present. So in the original state, pos43 has a stone, so it's not clear, but the problem states it is. Therefore, this is a contradiction, and perhaps the correct initial state is that pos43 is not clear. But since I can't change the problem statement, I have to work with what's given.

Assuming that "clear" refers to the absence of the agent, then after pushing the stone to pos44, pos44 has the stone, but is still considered clear for the purpose of the agent moving there. So the agent can move to pos44 even though the stone is there. That doesn't make sense, but according to the problem's initial state, that's possible. 

But in reality, when the stone is at pos44, pos44 is not clear (because the stone is there). Therefore, the agent cannot move there. So, after pushing the stone to pos44, the agent is at pos43. To push the stone from pos44 to pos54, the agent needs to be north of pos44 (pos34). So how does the agent get from pos43 to pos34?

From pos43, the agent can move dirleft (north) to pos33 (row3, column3). Then, from pos33, move dirright (south) to pos43 again. That's not helpful. Alternatively, the agent can move dirup (west) to pos42 (row4, column2), then move dirright (south) to pos52? No, perhaps there's a better path.

Wait, the agent needs to get from pos43 to pos34. Let's see the possible moves:

pos43 → dirleft (north) to pos33 (row3, column3).

From pos33, can the agent move east (dirdown) to pos34 (row3, column4)? Looking at the movement list for pos33: "You may move from location pos33 to location pos23 following direction dirleft", "You may move from location pos33 to location pos43 following direction dirright", "You may move from location pos33 to location pos32 following direction dirup", "You may move from location pos33 to location pos34 following direction dirdown".

Ah, yes. From pos33, moving dirdown (east) to pos34 (row3, column4). So the path from pos43 to pos34 is:

pos43 → dirleft (north) to pos33 → dirdown (east) to pos34.

Once at pos34, the agent can then push the stone from pos44 to pos54 (dirright, south). Because from pos34, moving dirright (south) to pos44 is allowed. Then, from pos44, dirright (south) to pos54. So the action would be "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos44 pos54 dirright". Since pos54 is a goal location, this action is valid.

So the steps would be:

1. Agent moves from pos14 to pos24 (dirright)
2. pos24 to pos34 (dirright)
3. pos34 to pos44 (dirright)
4. pos44 to pos43 (dirup) — but wait, pos44 to pos43 is dirup (west), but according to the movement list, "You may move from location pos44 to location pos43 following direction dirup". So moving dirup from pos44 takes the agent to pos43. But after pushing the stone to pos44, pos44 has the stone, so the agent can't move there. Wait, no. After the first push, the agent is at pos43. Then, to move to pos34, they need to go from pos43 → pos33 → pos34. 

Wait, let's outline the entire plan:

Initial state:

- Agent at pos14
- Stone1 at pos43
- Goal is pos54.

Steps:

1. Agent needs to reach a position where they can push stone1 from pos43 to pos44.

To do that, the agent must be at pos42 (since pushing from pos43 to pos44 (east) requires the agent to be at pos42 (west of pos43), moving east (dirdown) to pos43. But how does the agent get to pos42?

The agent starts at pos14. Let's find a path from pos14 to pos42.

Possible path:

pos14 → pos24 (dirright, south)
pos24 → pos34 (dirright, south)
pos34 → pos44 (dirright, south)
pos44 → pos43 (dirup, west) — but pos44 is clear (agent can move there?), but after moving to pos44, the agent is there. Then, move dirup (west) to pos43. But pos43 has the stone. Wait, but according to the problem's initial state, pos43 is clear (agent not there), but stone is present. So the agent can move to pos43 even with the stone there? That's not possible in reality, but according to the problem's flawed state, maybe they can. But then, after moving to pos43, the agent is there, and the stone is also there. That's invalid. So this path is not possible.

Alternative path: agent needs to reach pos42 to push the stone.

How to get from pos14 to pos42:

pos14 is row1, column4.

pos42 is row4, column2.

Possible path:

pos14 → pos24 (dirright, south)
pos24 → pos23 (dirup, west) — from pos24, movement options: "You may move from location pos24 to location pos14 following direction dirleft", "You may move from location pos24 to location pos34 following direction dirright", "You may move from location pos24 to location pos23 following direction dirup", "You may move from location pos24 to location pos25 following direction dirdown".

So from pos24, move dirup (west) to pos23 (row2, column3).

From pos23, can move dirup (west) to pos22 (row2, column2): "You may move from location pos23 to location pos22 following direction dirup".

From pos22, move dirright (south) to pos32 (row3, column2).

From pos32, move dirright (south) to pos42 (row4, column2).

So steps:

1. move player1 pos14 pos24 dirright
2. move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup
3. move player1 pos23 pos22 dirup
4. move player1 pos22 pos32 dirright
5. move player1 pos32 pos42 dirright

Now, the agent is at pos42. Now, they can push the stone from pos43 to pos44 with dirdown (east).

Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos43 pos44 dirdown

After this action:

- Agent is at pos43
- Stone is at pos44
- pos42 becomes clear

Now, the stone is at pos44, which is not a goal. Need to push it to pos54.

Next, the agent is at pos43. To push the stone from pos44 to pos54 (dirright, south), the agent needs to be at pos34 (north of pos44). How to get there?

From pos43, move dirleft (north) to pos33 (row3, column3).

From pos33, move dirdown (east) to pos34 (row3, column4).

From pos34, move dirright (south) to pos44 (row4, column4) — but pos44 has the stone, so can't move there. But according to the problem's definition, pos44 is clear if the agent isn't there. But the stone is there, so it's not clear. Therefore, the agent can't move there. So alternative path:

Agent is at pos33. From pos33, move dirright (south) to pos43. Not helpful. 

Alternatively, from pos33, move dirup (west) to pos32 (row3, column2), then move dirright (south) to pos42 (row4, column2), but that doesn't help.

Wait, the agent needs to get to pos34 to push the stone from pos44 to pos54. How?

From pos43:

1. pos43 → pos33 (dirleft)
2. pos33 → pos34 (dirdown) → possible?

From pos33's movements: "You may move from location pos33 to location pos34 following direction dirdown". Yes. Because dirdown is east (column increase). So pos33 is row3, column3. dirdown (east) would go to row3, column4 → pos34. So yes.

So steps:

1. move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft
2. move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown

Now, agent is at pos34. Now, can push the stone from pos44 to pos54 (dirright, south).

Action: pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos44 pos54 dirright

Preconditions check:

- Agent at pos34 (yes)
- Stone at pos44 (yes)
- pos54 is clear (initially, yes)
- Can move from pos34 to pos44 via dirright (yes: pos34 to pos44 is dirright)
- Can move from pos44 to pos54 via dirright (yes)
- pos54 is a goal (yes)

After this action:

- Agent is at pos44
- Stone is at pos54 (goal achieved)

But pos54 is a goal location, so the stone is now in a goal state. 

So the complete plan would be:

1. move player1 pos14 pos24 dirright
2. move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup
3. move player1 pos23 pos22 dirup
4. move player1 pos22 pos32 dirright
5. move player1 pos32 pos42 dirright
6. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos43 pos44 dirdown
7. move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft
8. move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown
9. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos44 pos54 dirright

But wait, after step 6, the agent is at pos43. Then steps 7 and 8 move to pos34. Step 9 is the final push.

But is this the shortest possible plan? Let's see if there's a shorter path.

Alternative approach: Can the agent reach pos42 more directly?

Starting at pos14:

pos14 → pos15 (dirdown) → pos25 (dirright) → pos35 (dirright) → pos45 (dirright) → pos55 (dirright) → but that seems longer. Not sure.

Alternatively, pos14 → pos24 (dirright), then pos24 → pos23 (dirup), pos23 → pos22 (dirup), pos22 → pos32 (dirright), pos32 → pos42 (dirright) — which is steps 1-5. So that's the same as before.

Is there a shorter path? For example, from pos14 → pos13 (dirup), then pos13 → pos23 (dirright), pos23 → pos22 (dirup), pos22 → pos32 (dirright), pos32 → pos42 (dirright). That's also 5 steps. So no improvement.

Alternatively, can the agent go from pos14 → pos24 (dirright), pos24 → pos34 (dirright), pos34 → pos44 (dirright), pos44 → pos43 (dirup). But after step 3 (pos34 → pos44), the agent is at pos44. Then, move dirup (west) to pos43. But pos43 has the stone. So the agent can't move there unless it's clear. According to the problem's initial state, pos43 is clear (even with the stone), so the agent can move there. Then, they can push the stone east to pos44. Wait, but the stone is already at pos43. So this approach might not work. 

Let me think again. If the agent goes to pos44 first, then to pos43, and pushes the stone east to pos44. But the stone is already at pos43. That doesn't make sense. 

Alternatively, perhaps the agent can reach pos42 through a different path. For example, from pos14 → pos24 → pos34 → pos44 → pos43 → pos42. But after reaching pos44, moving dirup (west) to pos43, then dirup (west) to pos42. So:

1. move player1 pos14 pos24 dirright
2. move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright
3. move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright
4. move player1 pos44 pos43 dirup
5. move player1 pos43 pos42 dirup

Then, push the stone from pos43 to pos44. But the agent is now at pos42. So step 6: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos43 pos44 dirdown.

Then, agent is at pos43. Then, move to pos33 → pos34, and push as before.

This path would have steps 1-5 to get to pos42, then the push, then steps to reach pos34, etc. Comparing to the original plan's 9 steps, this alternative would be:

Steps 1-5: 5 moves to reach pos42.

Step 6: push

Steps 7-8: move from pos43 to pos33 to pos34: 2 moves.

Step 9: push.

Total steps: 5+1+2+1 = 9. Same as before.

So no improvement. 

Is there a way to push the stone from pos43 to pos44 and then directly to pos54 without the intermediate steps?

For example, after pushing to pos44, can the agent push again from pos44 to pos54 in one action? The agent is at pos43 after the first push. To push from pos44 to pos54, the agent needs to be at pos34. So the agent must move from pos43 to pos34, which requires two moves (pos43→pos33→pos34). Then push. So total steps would be the same.

Alternatively, after the first push, can the agent move directly from pos43 to pos34? Let's see: from pos43, move dirleft (north) to pos33, then dirdown (east) to pos34. That's two moves. Then push. So no shortcut.

Is there a way to combine some moves? For example, after step 6 (pushtonongoal), agent is at pos43. Then, can they move directly to pos34 via some path?

From pos43, move dirleft (north) to pos33, then dirdown (east) to pos34. So two moves. Then push. So that's required.

So the total plan is 9 steps. Is there a shorter plan?

Alternative approach: Can the agent push the stone from pos43 to pos53 (south) and then to pos54 (east)?

Let's see:

pos43 → pos53 (dirright, south). Then pos53 → pos54 (dirdown, east). 

To push from pos43 to pos53 (dirright), the agent needs to be at pos42 (since moving dirright from pos42 to pos43 is allowed). Wait, no. To push dirright (south) from pos43 to pos53, the agent must be north of pos43, i.e., at pos33 (dirright from pos33 to pos43). So the agent needs to be at pos33. So how to get there?

The agent starts at pos14. Path to pos33:

pos14 → pos24 → pos34 → pos33 (dirleft, north). But pos34 to pos33 is dirleft? Let's check movement from pos34: "You may move from location pos34 to location pos24 following direction dirleft", "You may move from location pos34 to location pos44 following direction dirright", "You may move from location pos34 to location pos33 following direction dirup", "You may move from location pos34 to location pos35 following direction dirdown".

Wait, pos34 to pos33 is dirup (west). So from pos34, dirup (west) to pos33. So agent path:

pos14 → pos24 (dirright)
pos24 → pos34 (dirright)
pos34 → pos33 (dirup)

Then, agent at pos33 can push the stone from pos43 to pos53 (dirright, south). But the agent is at pos33, and the stone is at pos43. So the agent needs to move from pos33 to pos43 via dirright (south). So the action would be pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos43 pos53 dirright.

After this, the stone is at pos53 (not a goal), agent is at pos43.

Then, push from pos53 to pos54 (dirdown, east). To do that, the agent needs to be west of pos53 (pos52), move east (dirdown) to pos53, then push east to pos54.

But pos53 is row5, column3. To push east (dirdown) to pos54 (row5, column4), the agent must be at pos53's west (pos52), and push east. So the agent needs to move from pos43 to pos52. That's a long path.

This seems longer than the previous approach. So the initial plan of 9 steps is better.

Another alternative: Can the agent push the stone directly from pos43 to pos54 in one action? For that, the stone would have to move from pos43 to pos54 in one push, but according to the movement list, there's no direct path. pos43 to pos54 would require moving south and east, which is two steps. So no, can't be done in one action.

Thus, the initial plan of 9 steps seems to be the minimal possible. But wait, let's count the steps again:

Original plan steps:

1. move pos14 to pos24
2. move pos24 to pos23
3. move pos23 to pos22
4. move pos22 to pos32
5. move pos32 to pos42
6. pushtonongoal pos42 to pos43 to pos44
7. move pos43 to pos33
8. move pos33 to pos34
9. pushtogoal pos34 to pos44 to pos54

Total of 9 actions. Is there a way to reduce this?

Alternative path to pos42:

From pos14:

1. pos14 → pos13 (dirup)
2. pos13 → pos23 (dirright)
3. pos23 → pos22 (dirup)
4. pos22 → pos32 (dirright)
5. pos32 → pos42 (dirright)

Same 5 steps. Then push, etc. Still 9 steps.

Alternatively, can we use pushtonongoal and pushtogoal more efficiently?

After step 6, the agent is at pos43. Instead of moving to pos33 and pos34, can the agent move directly to pos44? But pos44 has the stone. So the agent can't move there. Or can they? According to the problem's definition, if "clear" means no agent, then even if the stone is there, the agent can move. But in reality, that's not possible. So this is a conflict.

Assuming that the agent can move to pos44 (even with the stone there), then steps could be:

After step 6 (agent at pos43):

7. move pos43 to pos44 (dirdown)
8. then push from pos44 to pos54 (dirright). But agent needs to be at pos34 to push south.

So no, that doesn't help.

Another idea: After pushing the stone to pos44, the agent is at pos43. Can the agent move from pos43 to pos44 (if allowed), then push from pos44 to pos54. But the agent would need to be at pos34 to push south. So no.

Thus, the initial plan of 9 steps seems to be the shortest possible.
