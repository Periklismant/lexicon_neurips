Let me analyze the problem:

1. We have a 2D grid with an agent (player1), a stone (stone1), and a goal location.
2. The agent starts at pos15.
3. The stone starts at pos23.
4. The only goal location is pos55.
5. We need to bring the stone to the goal location.
6. There's a constraint: the location pos43 must always remain clear. This means we can't move the stone or the agent through this location.

Let's visualize the grid to better understand the problem:

```
    1  2  3  4  5
  +--------------
1 |  .  .  .  .  .
2 |  .  .  S  .  .
3 |  .  .  .  .  .
4 |  .  .  X  .  .  (X represents pos43 which must remain clear)
5 |  .  .  .  .  G  (G represents the goal at pos55)
```

And the agent (player1) is at pos15, which is the top-right corner.

The actions we can use are:
1. move: The agent moves from one location to another in a certain direction.
2. pushtogoal: Push a stone to a goal location.
3. pushtonongoal: Push a stone to a non-goal location.

Given the constraints, we need to find a path for the agent to push the stone from pos23 to pos55 (the goal), while ensuring that pos43 remains clear at all times.

Let's plan our strategy:

1. First, the agent needs to move from pos15 to a position adjacent to the stone (pos23) in order to push it.
2. The agent can be at pos13, pos24, pos33, or pos22 to push the stone.
3. We then need to push the stone towards the goal pos55, which is at the bottom-right of the grid. Given that pos43 must remain clear, we need to navigate around it.
4. A possible path could be: push the stone from pos23 to pos33, then to pos34, pos35, pos45, and finally to pos55.

Let's implement this plan:

Step 1: Move the agent from pos15 to a position adjacent to pos23.
   - We can move from pos15 to pos14, then pos13, and be adjacent to the stone.

Step 2: Push the stone from pos23 towards the goal, avoiding pos43.
   - Push from pos13 to pos23 to pos33 (down)
   - Push from pos33 to pos34 (down)
   - Push from pos34 to pos35 (down)
   - Push from pos35 to pos45 (right)
   - Push from pos45 to pos55 (right, goal)

Now, let's check if this plan is feasible:

1. The agent starts at pos15.
2. Move agent to pos14: "move player1 pos15 pos14 dirup".
3. Move agent to pos13: "move player1 pos14 pos13 dirup".
4. Push stone from pos23 to pos33: "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos23 pos33 dirright".
   - Agent moves to pos23, stone moves to pos33.
5. Move agent to pos24: "move player1 pos23 pos24 dirdown".
6. Move agent to pos34: "move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright".
7. Push stone from pos33 to pos34: "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos33 pos32 dirleft".
   - Hmm, this direction doesn't seem right. Let's think again.

Okay, let me re-visualize the grid to get a better understanding:

```
    1  2  3  4  5
  +--------------
1 |  .  .  .  .  .
2 |  .  .  S  .  .
3 |  .  .  .  .  .
4 |  .  .  X  .  .  (X represents pos43 which must remain clear)
5 |  .  .  .  .  G  (G represents the goal at pos55)
```

And the agent (player1) is at pos15.

From this visualiation, I can see:
- To push the stone from pos23, the agent needs to be at pos13, pos22, pos24, or pos33.
- To push the stone to pos33, the agent would have to be at pos23, which is the stone's original position.

Now, let's establish the correct directions:
- "dirright" means moving right (increasing the first digit)
- "dirleft" means moving left (decreasing the first digit)
- "dirdown" means moving down (increasing the second digit)
- "dirup" means moving up (decreasing the second digit)

Given that, let's re-plan:

1. The agent starts at pos15.
2. Move agent to pos14: "move player1 pos15 pos14 dirup".
3. Move agent to pos13: "move player1 pos14 pos13 dirup".
4. Push stone from pos23 to pos33: "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos23 pos33 dirright".
   - Agent moves to pos23, stone moves to pos33.
5. Move agent to pos24: "move player1 pos23 pos24 dirdown".
6. Move agent to pos34: "move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright".
7. Push stone from pos33 to pos34: "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos33 pos23 dirleft".
   - No, this doesn't seem right either. If the agent is at pos34 and the stone is at pos33, the stone would move to pos32, not pos23.

I'm getting confused with the directions. Let me re-read the action definitions:

"You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright" 
This suggests that dirright increases the first digit (more to the right in usual grid notation).

Alright, let's get our directions straight:
- "dirright" means moving to the right (increasing the first digit)
- "dirleft" means moving to the left (decreasing the first digit)
- "dirdown" means moving down (increasing the second digit)
- "dirup" means moving up (decreasing the second digit)

Now, with this understanding, if we want to push the stone from pos23 to pos33 (i.e., one position to the right), the agent should be at pos13 (one position to the left of pos23) and the push direction should be "dirright".

Let's re-plan again:

Step 1: Move the agent from pos15 to a position adjacent to pos23.
   - We can move from pos15 to pos14, then to pos13, and be adjacent to the stone from the left.

Step 2: Push the stone from pos23 towards the goal, avoiding pos43.
   - Push from pos13 to pos23 to pos33 (right)
   - Push from pos34 to pos33 to pos32 (left)
   - Push from pos32 to pos33 to pos34 (right)
   - Push from pos35 to pos34 to pos33 (left)
   - Push from pos33 to pos34 to pos35 (right)
   - Push from pos45 to pos35 to pos25 (up)
   - Push from pos25 to pos35 to pos45 (down)
   - Push from pos55 to pos45 to pos35 (up)
   - Push from pos35 to pos45 to pos55 (down, goal)

Actually, let me visualize the grid with the correct rows and columns:

```
    1  2  3  4  5
  +--------------
1 |  .  .  .  .  A
2 |  .  .  S  .  .
3 |  .  .  .  .  .
4 |  .  .  X  .  .  (X represents pos43 which must remain clear)
5 |  .  .  .  .  G  (G represents the goal at pos55)
```

The agent (A) is at pos15, which is the top-right corner.
The stone (S) is at pos23.
The goal (G) is at pos55, which is the bottom-right corner.
The constraint (X) is at pos43, which is just above the middle of the grid.

Hmm, this still doesn't seem right. Let me redo the analysis based on the specific moves given in the problem:

"You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright"
"You may move from location pos11 to location pos12 following direction dirdown"

These two statements suggest that:
- pos11 -> pos21 is moving right (increasing the first digit)
- pos11 -> pos12 is moving down (increasing the second digit)

So, let's now visualize the grid:
   
```
    1  2  3  4  5
  +--------------
1 |  .  .  .  .  A
2 |  .  .  S  .  .
3 |  .  .  .  .  .
4 |  .  .  X  .  .  (X represents pos43 which must remain clear)
5 |  .  .  .  .  G  (G represents the goal at pos55)
```

Is this correct? With the move from pos11 to pos21 being "dirright" and from pos11 to pos12 being "dirdown", the grid would look like:

 y-axis (2nd digit)
   ^
   |
   |
   o---> x-axis (1st digit)

And pos11 is at the top-left, with the first digit increasing as we move right and the second digit increasing as we move down.

Now, with this understanding, the agent (pos15) is at the top-right, the stone (pos23) is a bit to the right and down from the top-left, and the goal (pos55) is at the bottom-right.

Now, let's think clearly:

1. The agent starts at pos15.
2. To move the stone, the agent must be in a position adjacent to the stone.
3. To push the stone from pos23 to a new position, the agent must be on the opposite side of the stone from the new position.
4. The goal is at pos55.
5. pos43 must always remain clear. This means neither the stone nor the agent can move to this position.

Let's plan our strategy:

1. The agent needs to move from pos15 to a position adjacent to the stone (pos23) in order to push it.
2. The agent can be at pos13, pos33, pos22, or pos24 to push the stone.
3. We want to push the stone towards the goal pos55, which is at the bottom-right of the grid.
4. Given that pos43 must remain clear, we need to navigate around it.
5. A possible path could be: push the stone from pos23 to pos24, then to pos25, pos35, pos45, and finally to pos55.

Let's implement this plan:

Step 1: Move the agent from pos15 to a position adjacent to pos23.
   - We need to move the agent to pos24 to push the stone down from pos23 to pos24.
   - Move from pos15 to pos14 (dirup)
   - Move from pos14 to pos24 (dirright)

Step 2: Push the stone from pos23 to pos24.
   - Push from pos24 to pos23 to pos24 (dirup) using the pushtonongoal action since pos24 is not a goal location.

Step 3: Move the agent to push the stone from pos24 to pos25.
   - Move from pos23 to pos24 (dirdown)
   - Push from pos24 to pos24 to pos25 (dirdown) using the pushtonongoal action since pos25 is not a goal location.

Step 4: Move the agent to push the stone from pos25 to pos35.
   - Move from pos24 to pos25 (dirdown)
   - Push from pos25 to pos25 to pos35 (dirright) using the pushtonongoal action since pos35 is not a goal location.

Step 5: Move the agent to push the stone from pos35 to pos45.
   - Move from pos25 to pos35 (dirright)
   - Push from pos35 to pos35 to pos45 (dirright) using the pushtonongoal action since pos45 is not a goal location.

Step 6: Move the agent to push the stone from pos45 to pos55 (the goal).
   - Move from pos35 to pos45 (dirright)
   - Push from pos45 to pos45 to pos55 (dirright) using the pushtogoal action since pos55 is a goal location.

Let's trace this step by step:

1. Agent at pos15, stone at pos23.
2. Move agent to pos14: "move player1 pos15 pos14 dirup".
3. Move agent to pos24: "move player1 pos14 pos24 dirright".
4. Push stone from pos23 to pos24: "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos23 pos24 dirup".

I'm having a bit of confusion with the push direction. Let's refer to the action definition:

"You may only perform this action if (i) agent p is at location l_p, (ii) stone s is at location l_from, (iii) location l_to is clear, (iv) you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d, (v) you can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d, and (vi) location l_to is not a goal location."

This suggests that if the agent is at pos24, the stone is at pos23, and we want to push the stone to pos22, the direction would be "dirup".

But if the agent is at pos24, the stone is at pos23, and we want to push the stone to pos24, this doesn't seem logical; the stone is already at pos23, not at pos24. The agent can't push the stone to its own location.

Let me rethink:

If the agent is at pos24 and the stone is at pos23, to push the stone, the agent must be on the opposite side of the stone from where we want the stone to go. If we want the stone to go to pos33, the agent should be at pos13.

With this thinking, here's the plan:

1. Agent at pos15, stone at pos23.
2. Move agent to pos14: "move player1 pos15 pos14 dirup".
3. Move agent to pos13: "move player1 pos14 pos13 dirup".
4. Push stone from pos23 to pos33: "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos23 pos33 dirright".
5. Now the agent is at pos23 and the stone is at pos33.
6. Move agent to pos24: "move player1 pos23 pos24 dirdown".
7. Move agent to pos34: "move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright".
8. Push stone from pos33 to pos34: "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos33 pos34 dirup".
9. Now the agent is at pos33 and the stone is at pos34.
10. Move agent to pos34: "move player1 pos33 pos34 dirright".
11. Push stone from pos34 to pos35: "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos34 pos35 dirdown".

Wait, this is still not right. In step 11, the agent and the stone are at the same position (pos34), which is not possible.

Let's start again:

1. Agent at pos15, stone at pos23.
2. First, let's get the agent to a position from where it can push the stone towards the goal.
   - From pos23, we want to push the stone to the right and then down towards the goal.
   - To push the stone from pos23 to pos33 (right), the agent needs to be at pos13.
3. Move agent from pos15 to pos14: "move player1 pos15 pos14 dirup".
4. Move agent from pos14 to pos13: "move player1 pos14 pos13 dirup".
5. Push stone from pos23 to pos33: "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos23 pos33 dirright".
   - Now the agent is at pos23 and the stone is at pos33.
6. To push the stone from pos33 to pos34 (down), the agent needs to be at pos32.
7. Move agent from pos23 to pos22: "move player1 pos23 pos22 dirup".
8. Move agent from pos22 to pos32: "move player1 pos22 pos32 dirright".
9. Push stone from pos33 to pos34: "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos33 pos34 dirdown".
   - Now the agent is at pos33 and the stone is at pos34.
10. To push the stone from pos34 to pos35 (down), the agent needs to be at pos33.
    - The agent is already at pos33.
11. Push stone from pos34 to pos35: "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos34 pos35 dirdown".
    - Now the agent is at pos34 and the stone is at pos35.
12. To push the stone from pos35 to pos45 (right), the agent needs to be at pos25.
13. Move agent from pos34 to pos24: "move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft".
14. Move agent from pos24 to pos25: "move player1 pos24 pos25 dirdown".
15. Move agent from pos25 to pos35: "move player1 pos25 pos35 dirright".
16. Push stone from pos35 to pos45: "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos35 pos35 pos45 dirright".

This doesn't make sense either. Let me reconsider the action definitions.

Let's go back to the action definitions:

"pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": Make agent p, situated at location l_p, push stone s from location l_from to goal location l_to, following direction d.

For example, "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos23 pos33 dirright" would mean the agent is at pos13, pushing the stone from pos23 to pos33 (which is a goal location), following the right direction.

But this doesn't seem to match our problem:
"pos55 is a goal location"
"stone1 is at location pos23"

The goal location is at pos55, not pos33. 

Let me go through the action definition again:

"pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": Make agent p, situated at location l_p, push stone s from location l_from to goal location l_to, following direction d.

Preconditions:
- agent p is at location l_p
- stone s is at location l_from
- location l_to is clear
- you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d
- you can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d
- location l_to is a goal location.

Given our grid, if the stone starts at pos23 and needs to go to pos55 (the goal), a possible path could be: pos23 -> pos33 -> pos34 -> pos35 -> pos45 -> pos55.

Let's trace this step by step:

1. To push the stone from pos23 to pos33, the agent needs to be at a location from which it can push the stone. Given the action definition, the agent must be at a location l_p where you can get from l_p to pos23 following a direction d, and you can also get from pos23 to pos33 following the same direction d.
   - From the problem statement, we can move "from location pos13 to location pos23 following direction dirright" and "from location pos23 to location pos33 following direction dirright".
   - So, the agent should be at pos13.

2. To get the agent to pos13:
   - Agent starts at pos15.
   - Move from pos15 to pos14 following dirup.
   - Move from pos14 to pos13 following dirup.

3. Push the stone from pos23 to pos33:
   - Agent at pos13, stone at pos23, want to push to pos33 following dirright.
   - Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos23 pos33 dirright.
   - After the push, agent is at pos23 and stone is at pos33.

4. To push the stone from pos33 to pos34, the agent needs to be at a location where it can push the stone again.
   - From the problem statement, we can move "from location pos32 to location pos33 following direction dirdown" and "from location pos33 to location pos34 following direction dirdown".
   - So, the agent should be at pos32.

5. To get the agent to pos32:
   - Agent is currently at pos23 after the first push.
   - Move from pos23 to pos22 following dirup.
   - Move from pos22 to pos32 following dirright.

6. Push the stone from pos33 to pos34:
   - Agent at pos32, stone at pos33, want to push to pos34 following dirdown.
   - Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos33 pos34 dirdown.
   - After the push, agent is at pos33 and stone is at pos34.

7. To push the stone from pos34 to pos35, the agent needs to be at a location where it can push the stone again.
   - From the problem statement, we can move "from location pos33 to location pos34 following direction dirdown" and "from location pos34 to location pos35 following direction dirdown".
   - So, the agent should be at pos33.
   - The agent is already at pos33 after the previous push.

8. Push the stone from pos34 to pos35:
   - Agent at pos33, stone at pos34, want to push to pos35 following dirdown.
   - Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos34 pos35 dirdown.
   - After the push, agent is at pos34 and stone is at pos35.

9. To push the stone from pos35 to pos45, the agent needs to be at a location where it can push the stone again.
   - From the problem statement, we can move "from location pos25 to location pos35 following direction dirright" and "from location pos35 to location pos45 following direction dirright".
   - So, the agent should be at pos25.

10. To get the agent to pos25:
    - Agent is currently at pos34 after the previous push.
    - Move from pos34 to pos24 following dirleft.
    - Move from pos24 to pos25 following dirdown.

11. Push the stone from pos35 to pos45:
    - Agent at pos25, stone at pos35, want to push to pos45 following dirright.
    - Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos25 pos35 pos45 dirright.
    - After the push, agent is at pos35 and stone is at pos45.

12. To push the stone from pos45 to pos55 (the goal), the agent needs to be at a location where it can push the stone again.
    - From the problem statement, we can move "from location pos35 to location pos45 following direction dirright" and "from location pos45 to location pos55 following direction dirright".
    - So, the agent should be at pos35.
    - The agent is already at pos35 after the previous push.

13. Push the stone from pos45 to pos55 (the goal):
    - Agent at pos35, stone at pos45, want to push to pos55 following dirright.
    - Action: pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos35 pos45 pos55 dirright.
    - After the push, agent is at pos45 and stone is at pos55 (the goal).

The plan looks good, but I want to double-check the moves to ensure they make sense in the grid.

Let's check if this plan is valid by checking the grid:

```
    1  2  3  4  5
  +--------------
1 |  .  .  .  .  A
2 |  .  .  S  .  .
3 |  .  .  .  .  .
4 |  .  .  X  .  .  (X represents pos43 which must remain clear)
5 |  .  .  .  .  G  (G represents the goal at pos55)
```

1. Agent starts at pos15, stone at pos23.
2. Move agent to pos14: "move player1 pos15 pos14 dirup". 
   - Valid move.
3. Move agent to pos13: "move player1 pos14 pos13 dirup". 
   - Valid move.
4. Push stone from pos23 to pos33: "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos23 pos33 dirright".
   - Valid push, as pos33 is not a goal location.
   - Agent at pos23, stone at pos33.
5. Move agent to pos22: "move player1 pos23 pos22 dirup". 
   - Valid move.
6. Move agent to pos32: "move player1 pos22 pos32 dirright". 
   - Valid move.
7. Push stone from pos33 to pos34: "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos33 pos34 dirdown".
   - Valid push, as pos34 is not a goal location.
   - Agent at pos33, stone at pos34.
8. Push stone from pos34 to pos35: "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos34 pos35 dirdown".
   - Valid push, as pos35 is not a goal location.
   - Agent at pos34, stone at pos35.
9. Move agent to pos24: "move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft". 
   - Valid move.
10. Move agent to pos25: "move player1 pos24 pos25 dirdown". 
   - Valid move.
11. Push stone from pos35 to pos45: "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos25 pos35 pos45 dirright".
   - Valid push, as pos45 is not a goal location.
   - Agent at pos35, stone at pos45.
12. Push stone from pos45 to pos55: "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos35 pos45 pos55 dirright".
   - Valid push, as pos55 is a goal location.
   - Agent at pos45, stone at pos55.

The plan looks valid. Let's consolidate it:

1. move player1 pos15 pos14 dirup
2. move player1 pos14 pos13 dirup
3. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos23 pos33 dirright
4. move player1 pos23 pos22 dirup
5. move player1 pos22 pos32 dirright
6. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos33 pos34 dirdown
7. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos34 pos35 dirdown
8. move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft
9. move player1 pos24 pos25 dirdown
10. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos25 pos35 pos45 dirright
11. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos35 pos45 pos55 dirright

Actually, I need to double-check the "dirdown" direction in our pushes. The problem statement defines the directions as:

"You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright"
"You may move from location pos11 to location pos12 following direction dirdown"

Given that, dirdown increases the second digit (going down in the grid), and dirright increases the first digit (going right in the grid).

For steps 6 and 7, we're pushing from pos33 to pos34 and from pos34 to pos35 following dirdown. But dirdown would increase the second digit, not the first. To go from pos33 to pos34 or from pos34 to pos35, we'd need to follow dirright, not dirdown.

Let me revisit the pushes:

7. Push stone from pos33 to pos34:
   - Agent at pos32, stone at pos33, want to push to pos34.
   - Looking at the grid, pos34 is to the right of pos33, so the direction is dirright, not dirdown.
   - Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos33 pos34 dirright.

8. Push stone from pos34 to pos35:
   - Agent at pos33, stone at pos34, want to push to pos35.
   - Looking at the grid, pos35 is to the right of pos34, so the direction is dirright, not dirdown.
   - Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos34 pos35 dirright.

Wait, let me reread the action definition:

"pushtonongoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": Make agent p, situated at location l_p, push stone s from location l_from to non-goal location l_to, following direction d.

Preconditions:
- agent p is at location l_p
- stone s is at location l_from
- location l_to is clear
- you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d
- you can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d
- location l_to is not a goal location.

I made an error in my previous analysis. The direction 'd' is used to check if we can get from l_p to l_from and from l_from to l_to following that direction. 

For step 6, we're trying to push the stone from pos33 to pos34:
- Agent is at pos32.
- Can we get from pos32 to pos33 following some direction? Yes, from the problem statement, we can move "from location pos32 to location pos33 following direction dirdown".
- Can we get from pos33 to pos34 following the same direction? Yes, from the problem statement, we can move "from location pos33 to location pos34 following direction dirdown".
- So, the action is: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos33 pos34 dirdown.

For step 7, we're trying to push the stone from pos34 to pos35:
- Agent is at pos33.
- Can we get from pos33 to pos34 following some direction? Yes, from the problem statement, we can move "from location pos33 to location pos34 following direction dirdown".
- Can we get from pos34 to pos35 following the same direction? Yes, from the problem statement, we can move "from location pos34 to location pos35 following direction dirdown".
- So, the action is: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos34 pos35 dirdown.

It seems like the second digit increases from left to right and the first digit increases from top to bottom. This is a bit unusual, but if that's the convention used in the problem, then my initial plan is correct.

Let's reconsider the grid layout:

From the moves provided in the problem statement:

"You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright"
"You may move from location pos11 to location pos12 following direction dirdown"

This indicates that the grid is laid out as follows:

```
    pos11 pos21 pos31 pos41 pos51
    pos12 pos22 pos32 pos42 pos52
    pos13 pos23 pos33 pos43 pos53
    pos14 pos24 pos34 pos44 pos54
    pos15 pos25 pos35 pos45 pos55
```

In this layout, dirright increases the first digit (moving right) and dirdown increases the second digit (moving down).

Given this layout, the agent is at pos15 (bottom-left) and the stone is at pos23 (middle-top). The goal is at pos55 (bottom-right).

Actually, I'm getting confused between the two digits in the position representation. Let's clarify: 

In a position "posXY", X represents the horizontal coordinate (left to right) and Y represents the vertical coordinate (top to bottom).

So in this representation, pos11 is at the top-left, pos15 is at the bottom-left, pos51 is at the top-right, and pos55 is at the bottom-right.

Given the moves we have, "from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright" suggests moving from pos11 to pos21 (i.e., moving right).

And "from location pos11 to location pos12 following direction dirdown" suggests moving from pos11 to pos12 (i.e., moving down).

This confirms our understanding of the grid layout.

Now:
- The agent is at pos15 (bottom-left).
- The stone is at pos23 (middle, closer to the top).
- The goal is at pos55 (bottom-right).
- The constraint is at pos43 (middle, closer to the bottom).

Let's rethink the path for the stone:
- From pos23, we want to move it to the goal at pos55.
- A reasonable path might be: pos23 -> pos33 -> pos43 (but this is constrained) -> pos53.
- Alternatively, we can go down first: pos23 -> pos24 -> pos25 -> pos35 -> pos45 -> pos55.

Let's try the latter path:

1. Agent at pos15, stone at pos23.
2. To push the stone from pos23 to pos24, the agent needs to be at a location where it can push the stone.
   - From the problem statement, we can move "from location pos22 to location pos23 following direction dirdown" and "from location pos23 to location pos24 following direction dirdown".
   - So, the agent should be at pos22.

3. To get the agent to pos22:
   - Agent starts at pos15.
   - Move from pos15 to pos14 following dirup.
   - Move from pos14 to pos13 following dirup.
   - Move from pos13 to pos12 following dirup.
   - Move from pos12 to pos22 following dirright.

4. Push the stone from pos23 to pos24:
   - Agent at pos22, stone at pos23, want to push to pos24 following dirdown.
   - Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos23 pos24 dirdown.
   - After the push, agent is at pos23 and stone is at pos24.

5. To push the stone from pos24 to pos25, the agent needs to be at a location where it can push the stone again.
   - From the problem statement, we can move "from location pos23 to location pos24 following direction dirdown" and "from location pos24 to location pos25 following direction dirdown".
   - So, the agent should be at pos23.
   - The agent is already at pos23 after the previous push.

6. Push the stone from pos24 to pos25:
   - Agent at pos23, stone at pos24, want to push to pos25 following dirdown.
   - Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos24 pos25 dirdown.
   - After the push, agent is at pos24 and stone is at pos25.

7. To push the stone from pos25 to pos35, the agent needs to be at a location where it can push the stone again.
   - From the problem statement, we can move "from location pos15 to location pos25 following direction dirright" and "from location pos25 to location pos35 following direction dirright".
   - So, the agent should be at pos15.

8. To get the agent to pos15:
   - Agent is currently at pos24 after the previous push.
   - Move from pos24 to pos14 following dirleft.
   - Move from pos14 to pos15 following dirdown.

9. Push the stone from pos25 to pos35:
   - Agent at pos15, stone at pos25, want to push to pos35 following dirright.
   - Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos15 pos25 pos35 dirright.
   - After the push, agent is at pos25 and stone is at pos35.

10. To push the stone from pos35 to pos45, the agent needs to be at a location where it can push the stone again.
    - From the problem statement, we can move "from location pos25 to location pos35 following direction dirright" and "from location pos35 to location pos45 following direction dirright".
    - So, the agent should be at pos25.
    - The agent is already at pos25 after the previous push.

11. Push the stone from pos35 to pos45:
    - Agent at pos25, stone at pos35, want to push to pos45 following dirright.
    - Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos25 pos35 pos45 dirright.
    - After the push, agent is at pos35 and stone is at pos45.

12. To push the stone from pos45 to pos55 (the goal), the agent needs to be at a location where it can push the stone again.
    - From the problem statement, we can move "from location pos35 to location pos45 following direction dirright" and "from location pos45 to location pos55 following direction dirright".
    - So, the agent should be at pos35.
    - The agent is already at pos35 after the previous push.

13. Push the stone from pos45 to pos55 (the goal):
    - Agent at pos35, stone at pos45, want to push to pos55 following dirright.
    - Action: pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos35 pos45 pos55 dirright.
    - After the push, agent is at pos45 and stone is at pos55 (the goal).

Let's consolidate this plan:

1. move player1 pos15 pos14 dirup
2. move player1 pos14 pos13 dirup
3. move player1 pos13 pos12 dirup
4. move player1 pos12 pos22 dirright
5. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos23 pos24 dirdown
6. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos24 pos25 dirdown
7. move player1 pos24 pos14 dirleft
8. move player1 pos14 pos15 dirdown
9. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos15 pos25 pos35 dirright
10. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos25 pos35 pos45 dirright
11. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos35 pos45 pos55 dirright

This plan seems more intuitive given the layout of the grid, and it avoids the constrained pos43.

Wait, I need to check if this passes the constraint: "Location pos43 is clear". 

In the plan, the stone and the agent don't go to pos43, so that constraint is satisfied. 

The plan seems valid for our problem:

1. move player1 pos15 pos14 dirup
2. move player1 pos14 pos13 dirup
3. move player1 pos13 pos12 dirup
4. move player1 pos12 pos22 dirright
5. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos23 pos24 dirdown
6. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos24 pos25 dirdown
7. move player1 pos24 pos14 dirleft
8. move player1 pos14 pos15 dirdown
9. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos15 pos25 pos35 dirright
10. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos25 pos35 pos45 dirright
11. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos35 pos45 pos55 dirright

Let's see if we can make this plan more optimal:

The agent takes a roundabout way to get to pos22 from pos15 (steps 1-4). Maybe there's a more direct route?

Looking at the problem statement:
"You may move from location pos15 to location pos25 following direction dirright" and 
"You may move from location pos25 to location pos24 following direction dirup" and
"You may move from location pos24 to location pos23 following direction dirup" and
"You may move from location pos23 to location pos22 following direction dirup"

So a more direct route would be:
1. Move agent from pos15 to pos25 following dirright.
2. Move agent from pos25 to pos24 following dirup.
3. Move agent from pos24 to pos23 following dirup.
4. Move agent from pos23 to pos22 following dirup.

However, this is still 4 moves, which is the same as the original 4 steps. So it's not any more optimal. Let's go ahead with our plan.

Actually, let's just check if there's a more optimal solution overall. The current plan has 11 steps. Can we do better?

The path for the stone currently is: pos23 -> pos24 -> pos25 -> pos35 -> pos45 -> pos55. This path seems pretty straightforward and doesn't involve any unnecessary detours. The agent also doesn't make any unnecessary moves.

So, the optimal plan for our problem is:

1. move player1 pos15 pos14 dirup
2. move player1 pos14 pos13 dirup
3. move player1 pos13 pos12 dirup
4. move player1 pos12 pos22 dirright
5. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos23 pos24 dirdown
6. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos24 pos25 dirdown
7. move player1 pos24 pos14 dirleft
8. move player1 pos14 pos15 dirdown
9. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos15 pos25 pos35 dirright
10. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos25 pos35 pos45 dirright
11. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos35 pos45 pos55 dirright

Let me do one last check to ensure we're not moving the stone or the agent to the constrained pos43, and it seems like we're not.

Hmm, on second thought, maybe a more direct route for the stone would be: pos23 -> pos24 -> pos34 -> pos44 -> pos54 -> pos55. But then, this path gets dangerously close to the constrained pos43, and we'd have to be careful not to move the agent or the stone to that position. Let's stick with our original plan, which is safe and straightforward.

Final plan:
1. move player1 pos15 pos14 dirup
2. move player1 pos14 pos13 dirup
3. move player1 pos13 pos12 dirup
4. move player1 pos12 pos22 dirright
5. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos23 pos24 dirdown
6. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos24 pos25 dirdown
7. move player1 pos24 pos14 dirleft
8. move player1 pos14 pos15 dirdown
9. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos15 pos25 pos35 dirright
10. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos25 pos35 pos45 dirright
11. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos35 pos45 pos55 dirright
