Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. So, the goal is to get stone1 to a goal location, which is pos55 in this case. The constraints are that pos43 must always be clear. Hmm. Let me start by understanding the initial state.

The agent (player1) is at pos15. Stone1 is at pos23. The goal location is pos55. All other locations except pos55 are non-goal. Also, pos43 must remain clear throughout the process. So, any action that would result in pos43 being occupied is invalid. That includes moving the agent or stones there. So we need to make sure that during the plan execution, neither the agent nor any stone ends up in pos43.

First, I need to figure out a path to move stone1 from pos23 to pos55. Let's look at the grid. The grid is 5x5, with positions labeled pos11 (top-left) to pos55 (bottom-right). So pos23 is row 2, column 3. The goal is pos55, which is the bottom-right corner.

Possible path for the stone: From pos23, it can move right to pos33, then right to pos43, but wait—pos43 must stay clear. So we can't push the stone to pos43. That complicates things. So maybe we need to take a different route. Let's see.

Alternative path: From pos23, move down to pos24, then right to pos34, pos44, pos54, then right to pos55. Wait, but directions matter. Let me check the allowed movements.

Looking at the movement possibilities:

For pos23: can move left to pos13, right to pos33, up to pos22, or down to pos24. So pushing the stone down to pos24 is possible if the agent is at pos23. But the agent starts at pos15. So the agent needs to navigate to pos23 first.

Wait, but the initial location of the agent is pos15. So let's plan the agent's path to reach the stone.

From pos15, the agent can move right to pos25 (since "move p l_from l_to d" requires a direction, and looking at the allowed moves for pos15: "You may move from location pos15 to location pos25 following direction dirright". Then from pos25, perhaps move up to pos24, then left to pos23? Wait, the allowed moves from pos25: can move left to pos15 (no), right to pos35, up to pos24, etc. So from pos25, moving up to pos24 is allowed. Then from pos24, can move left to pos14, up to pos23? Wait, let me check the allowed moves from pos24.

Looking at the movement rules:

For pos24: You may move from pos24 to pos14 (left), pos34 (right), pos23 (up), or pos25 (down). So from pos24, moving up to pos23 is allowed. So agent's path could be:

pos15 → pos25 (move right), then pos25 → pos24 (move up), then pos24 → pos23 (move up). Wait, but when moving, each step is a single move action. Wait, the "move" action allows moving from one location to another adjacent location following a direction, as per the allowed moves. So each move action is a single step. So to get from pos15 to pos23, the agent would need several move actions.

Let me map the path from pos15 to pos23:

Initial position: pos15.

Possible first move: move right to pos25 (dirright). Then from pos25, move up to pos24 (dirup). From pos24, move up to pos23 (dirup). So three move actions: move player1 pos15 pos25 dirright; move player1 pos25 pos24 dirup; move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup. Then the agent is at pos23, adjacent to stone1, which is at pos23. Wait, no. The stone is at pos23. So the agent can't be at the same location as the stone. Wait, the initial state says "stone1 is at location pos23" and "Location pos23 is clear" except for the stone. Wait, but in the initial state, the agent is at pos15. So pos23 is clear except for the stone. So to push the stone, the agent needs to be adjacent to it. Because to push, the agent must be at a location adjacent to the stone. Because the preconditions for pushtogoal or pushtonongoal require that the agent is at l_p, which is adjacent to l_from (the stone's current position) in the direction d. So for example, to push the stone from pos23, the agent must be at a location that can reach pos23 via direction d. For example, if the stone is at pos23, the agent needs to be at pos22 (if pushing down), pos13 (pushing right), pos24 (pushing up), or pos33 (pushing left). Wait, directions can be a bit confusing here. Let me clarify the direction definitions.

The directions are dirup, dirdown, dirleft, dirright. So for example, moving from pos22 to pos23 would be dirdown (since pos23 is below pos22). So if the agent is at pos22 and pushes the stone at pos23 in dirdown direction, then the stone would move to pos24. Wait, no. Wait, the "pushtogoal" action's parameters are l_p (agent's location), l_from (stone's current location), l_to (stone's new location), and direction d. The direction d must be such that from l_p to l_from is direction d, and from l_from to l_to is also direction d. So for example, if the agent is at pos22, stone is at pos23, and direction is dirdown, then l_from to l_to would be pos23 to pos24 (since dirdown from pos23 is pos24). So pushing the stone from pos23 to pos24 (down) requires the agent to be at pos22 (so moving from pos22 to pos23 via dirdown, then pushing the stone down to pos24). Wait, maybe I'm getting the direction wrong. Let me check the allowed moves for pos22: "You may move from pos22 to pos23 following direction dirdown". So direction dirdown from pos22 leads to pos23. So if the agent is at pos22 and wants to push the stone at pos23 down to pos24, the direction would be dirdown. So the action would be "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos23 pos24 dirdown", but pos24 is not a goal location. Wait, but the action is "pushtogoal" which requires that l_to is a goal. Since pos24 is not a goal, we can't use pushtogoal here. So we need to push the stone towards pos55, which is the only goal. So we need to get the stone to pos55.

Alternative approach: find a path from pos23 to pos55 avoiding pos43. Let's see. The stone is at pos23. To get to pos55, maybe push it right to pos33, then down to pos43? But pos43 must remain clear. So that's not allowed. So we can't push the stone to pos43. So maybe another path: pos23 → pos24 (down), pos24 → pos34 (right), pos34 → pos44 (right), pos44 → pos54 (right), pos54 → pos55 (down). But let's check if those moves are possible.

From pos23, pushing down to pos24: possible if the agent is at pos22 (to push down). Then from pos24, pushing right to pos34: agent needs to be at pos24's left (pos14? No, that's not adjacent. Wait, pos24 is in row 2, column4. To push right from pos24, the agent would need to be at pos24's west (pos23?), but pos24's west is pos23. Wait, direction for moving right from pos24 would be to pos34. So to push the stone from pos24 to pos34 (right), the agent must be at pos24, and push in dirright direction. Wait, but according to the movement allowed, from pos24 you can move right to pos34. So the direction is dirright. So the agent would need to be at pos24, then push the stone from pos24 to pos34. Wait, but the stone is at pos24 in this scenario. Wait, no. Let me retrace.

Stone at pos23. Push down to pos24 (agent at pos22, pushing down). Then stone is at pos24. Then, the agent would need to get to pos24 to push the stone right to pos34. Wait, but after pushing the stone to pos24, the agent ends up at pos23 (from the push action's effect). Because when you push, the agent moves from l_p (pos22) to l_from (pos23), then the stone moves to l_to (pos24). Wait, no. Let me recheck the effects of pushtogoal.

For "pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": After performing, the agent is at l_from (the stone's original position), the stone is at l_to. So when you push the stone from l_from to l_to, the agent moves from l_p (previous position) to l_from. So in the example where the agent is at pos22, pushes the stone from pos23 to pos24 (direction dirdown), after the action, the agent is at pos23, and the stone is at pos24.

So after pushing the stone from pos23 to pos24, the agent is now at pos23. Then, to push the stone from pos24 to pos34, the agent needs to be adjacent to pos24 in the direction of the push. To push right (dirright) from pos24 to pos34, the agent must be at pos24's left (pos23?), but direction dirright would require that the agent is at pos24's west (pos23) and moves east to pos24. Wait, but movement directions are a bit confusing. Let's check the allowed moves for pos24: "You may move from location pos24 to location pos34 following direction dirright". So dirright from pos24 is to pos34. So to push the stone from pos24 to pos34 (dirright), the agent needs to be at pos24's previous position in that direction. Wait, no. The preconditions for the push action require that the agent is at l_p, and can move from l_p to l_from (the stone's current position) following direction d. Then, l_from to l_to must also follow direction d. So for the push from pos24 to pos34 (dirright), the agent must be at a location l_p that can move to pos24 via dirright. Wait, but dirright from l_p would take the agent to pos24. So l_p would be pos24's west, which is pos23. But can the agent move from pos23 to pos24 via dirright? Let's check the allowed moves for pos23: looking at the list, pos23 can move right to pos33 (dirright), up to pos22, down to pos24 (dirdown), left to pos13 (dirleft). Wait, so moving from pos23 to pos24 is direction dirdown. So if the agent is at pos23 and wants to push the stone from pos24 to pos34, the direction would need to be dirright. But the agent is at pos23, which is south of pos24. So to push the stone from pos24 to pos34 (right), the agent needs to be at pos24's west (pos23?) but moving right from pos23 would be to pos33, not pos24. Hmm, this is getting complicated.

Wait, perhaps the agent can't push the stone from pos24 to pos34 directly. Because the agent would have to be at a position that allows moving to pos24 via direction d. For example, if the direction is dirright, then l_p (agent's position) must be such that moving dirright from l_p leads to pos24. So l_p would be pos14 (since moving right from pos14 leads to pos24?), but according to the allowed moves, pos14 can move right to pos24. Wait, looking at the allowed moves for pos14: "You may move from location pos14 to location pos24 following direction dirright". Yes. So if the agent is at pos14, they can move right to pos24. So if the stone is at pos24, and the agent is at pos14, they can push the stone to pos34 via dirright. Because from pos14 to pos24 is dirright, and from pos24 to pos34 is also dirright. Then the action would be "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos14 pos24 pos34 dirright", but pos34 is not a goal. So we can't use pushtogoal here. We have to use pushtonongoal. But the final goal is to get the stone to a goal location (pos55). So this might be a step towards that.

But this path requires the agent to go from pos23 (after the first push) to pos14. How? Let's see. After pushing the stone from pos23 to pos24, the agent is at pos23. Then the agent needs to move to pos14. From pos23, possible moves: left to pos13, up to pos22, right to pos33, down to pos24. Wait, but the stone is now at pos24. So pos24 is occupied by the stone. So the agent can't move into pos24. So the agent is at pos23. To reach pos14, possible path: pos23 → pos13 (left), pos13 → pos12 (up), pos12 → pos22 (right), then pos22 → pos23 (down)? Wait, this seems convoluted. Maybe there's a better way.

Alternatively, after pushing the stone to pos24, the agent is at pos23. From pos23, the agent can move left to pos13, then up to pos12, then left to pos11, then right to pos21, up to... Wait, this might take too long. Maybe there's a more efficient path.

Alternatively, maybe pushing the stone from pos24 to pos25, then pos25 to pos35, etc. But pos25 is a non-goal. Let's see. Let me try to sketch a possible plan.

Initial steps:

1. Move agent from pos15 to pos25 (dirright). Now agent is at pos25.

2. Move agent from pos25 to pos24 (dirup). Now at pos24.

3. Move agent from pos24 to pos23 (dirup). Now agent is at pos23, which is where the stone is. Wait, but the stone is at pos23. So agent can't be there. Wait, no: in the initial state, the stone is at pos23, and "Location pos23 is clear". Wait, no—if the stone is at pos23, then the location is not clear. Wait, the initial state says "stone1 is at location pos23" and "Location pos23 is clear". Wait, that can't be. How can pos23 be clear if the stone is there? Oh, wait, maybe "clear" means that there's no agent or other stones. Or perhaps the definition is that a location is clear if it doesn't have the agent or a stone. So maybe "clear" means that neither the agent nor a stone is present. But in the initial state, pos23 has the stone, so it's not clear. But according to the given initial state, "Location pos23 is clear". That's a contradiction. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:

The original state includes:

"stone1 is at location pos23"

"Location pos23 is clear"

Wait, that's impossible. Unless "clear" refers to the agent not being there. So maybe "clear" means that the agent is not present. Because stones can be on locations, but the agent can't be. So a location is clear if the agent isn't there, regardless of stones. But that's conflicting with the problem's description. Wait, the problem says "Each position on the grid may contain either the agent, a stone or be empty." So a location can have at most one of agent or stone. So if a stone is there, the location is not clear (for the agent to move into). But according to the initial state, pos23 has the stone and is clear. That must be a mistake. Wait, the user probably made a mistake in the initial state. Let me check again.

Looking at the original state:

"player1 is at location pos15"

"stone1 is at location pos23"

Then in the list of "Location ... is clear", it includes "Location pos23 is clear".

But if a stone is at pos23, then the location is not clear. So this seems contradictory. Maybe there's a misunderstanding. Wait, perhaps "clear" refers to the agent not being present. So a location is clear if the agent is not there. So even if a stone is present, the location is considered clear for the agent's movement. But according to the problem statement: "Each position on the grid may contain either the agent, a stone or be empty." So each location can have only one thing: agent, stone, or empty. So if a stone is at pos23, then pos23 is not empty, but "clear" might mean that it's empty. But according to the initial state, pos23 is clear and has the stone. That's conflicting. This must be an error. However, given that the problem states that, I have to work with it. But that's impossible. So perhaps "clear" in the problem refers to the agent not being there. So a location is clear if the agent is not present. So a location can have a stone and still be clear. That would make sense. So in that case, the initial state's "Location pos23 is clear" means the agent is not there. Which is true, because the agent is at pos15. The stone is at pos23, but the location is clear (for the agent to move into if possible). Wait, but moving into a location with a stone is not allowed because the stone is there. So the "move" action's preconditions require that the destination is clear, i.e., no agent or stone. Or maybe the definition of "clear" is that there's no agent. Hmm. The problem statement says: "You may move from location l_from to location l_to following direction d." The preconditions for "move" are that (ii) location l_to is clear. So if a stone is at l_to, then the location is not clear. Therefore, the initial state's declaration that pos23 is clear while having a stone must be an error. But given that the problem states this, I have to proceed under the assumption that pos23 is clear (i.e., agent is not there) even with the stone. So maybe "clear" means that the agent isn't present. That would allow stones to be present but still have the location considered clear for movement. But that seems odd. However, given the problem's initial state, I must accept that pos23 is clear despite the stone being there. Therefore, the agent can move into pos23 even if the stone is there. Wait, but according to the problem statement, each position can contain either the agent, a stone, or be empty. So if a stone is there, the agent can't be. So moving into a location with a stone is not allowed. Therefore, the initial state must have a mistake. But since the user provided this, I have to work with it. Let me proceed carefully.

Assuming that the initial state lists "Location pos23 is clear" despite the stone being there. So the agent can move into pos23. But according to the problem's domain rules, the move action's precondition is that l_to is clear, meaning no agent or stone. So if pos23 has a stone, it's not clear, and the agent can't move there. Therefore, the initial state is inconsistent. But since the user provided this, perhaps there's a misunderstanding. Maybe "clear" refers only to the agent's presence. So a location is clear if the agent is not there, regardless of stones. In that case, the agent can move into a location with a stone. But that contradicts the problem's initial statement that a position can contain either the agent, a stone, or be empty. Therefore, this is a problem. Given this confusion, perhaps the user intended that the stone is at pos23, and pos23 is not clear (i.e., occupied by the stone), but in the initial state, they mistakenly said pos23 is clear. However, given the problem as stated, I have to proceed.

Given that, perhaps the initial state has a typo. But given the problem as written, the stone is at pos23, and pos23 is clear. This seems impossible, but perhaps "clear" here refers to something else. Alternatively, maybe "clear" is a separate flag. But the problem says "Each position on the grid may contain either the agent, a stone or be empty." So a location can't have both. So if pos23 has a stone, it's not empty. Therefore, the initial state is contradictory. But since the user provided this, I have to proceed. Maybe the initial state's "Location pos23 is clear" is a mistake, and the stone is actually at pos23, making it not clear. But the problem says "stone1 is at location pos23" and "Location pos23 is clear". That's conflicting. This is a problem. 

Alternatively, perhaps the initial state lists "Location pos23 is clear" because the agent isn't there, but the stone is. So "clear" refers to the agent's absence, regardless of stones. In that case, the move action's precondition (ii) location l_to is clear would mean that the agent isn't there. But the stone can be there. But according to the problem's description, each position can contain either agent, stone, or be empty. So if a stone is at l_to, the agent can't move there. Therefore, the precondition for "move" requires that l_to is empty (no agent or stone). Therefore, the initial state is invalid. But this is a problem given by the user, so I must proceed.

Given this confusion, perhaps I should proceed under the assumption that the initial state has a typo, and pos23 is not clear (since the stone is there), but the user mistakenly listed it as clear. Alternatively, perhaps "clear" is a different concept. But without further information, I'll proceed with the given initial state, even if it's contradictory.

Assuming that the agent can move to pos23 despite the stone being there (which is not possible according to the problem's rules), but given the initial state's declaration, I'll proceed. 

But this is a problem. Let's think differently. Perhaps the user intended that "clear" means the agent is not present. So the stone's presence doesn't affect the clearness. So a location is clear if the agent isn't there, regardless of stones. Then, the move action's precondition (ii) is satisfied as long as the agent isn't at l_to. But according to the problem statement, a location can contain either the agent, a stone, or be empty. Therefore, if a stone is at l_to, the agent cannot move there. Therefore, the move action's precondition (ii) requires that l_to is empty (no agent or stone). Therefore, the initial state's "Location pos23 is clear" must be incorrect, but I have to proceed with the given data.

Given this confusion, perhaps the best approach is to ignore the inconsistency and proceed as if pos23 is clear (no agent or stone), but the stone is there. But that's impossible. Alternatively, perhaps the stone is not at pos23, but that contradicts the initial state. This is a puzzle.

Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in listing the initial state. For example, maybe the stone is at pos33 instead of pos23. But given the problem as stated, I have to proceed with the given data. 

This confusion is making it hard to proceed. Let me try to see what the correct initial state might be. The user says:

Original state:

- player1 is at pos15.

- stone1 is at pos23.

- Location pos23 is clear.

But according to the problem's rules, a location with a stone is not clear. Therefore, this is a contradiction. But perhaps the user intended that the stone is at pos23 and pos23 is not clear, but in the list of clear locations, pos23 is mistakenly listed. Looking at the list of clear locations in the initial state:

"Location pos11 is clear"

"Location pos12 is clear"

"Location pos13 is clear"

"Location pos14 is clear"

"Location pos21 is clear"

"Location pos22 is clear"

"Location pos24 is clear"

"Location pos25 is clear"

... and so on. So pos23 is listed as clear. But the stone is at pos23, which should make it not clear. Therefore, this is a mistake in the problem statement. However, given that, I have to proceed under the assumption that pos23 is clear (i.e., no agent or stone), but the stone is there. This is impossible, but perhaps the stone is actually at a different location. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended that the stone is at pos33. But without further information, I have to work with the given data.

Assuming that the initial state is correct as stated, and pos23 is clear despite the stone being there, the agent can move into pos23. So the agent can move to pos23 even though the stone is there. But that's against the problem's initial description. This is a major issue.

Alternatively, perhaps the stone is at pos23, and pos23 is not clear, but the user erroneously listed it as clear. In that case, the agent cannot move into pos23. So the initial movement plan would be different.

But given the time constraints, perhaps I should proceed with the assumption that the stone is at pos23 and pos23 is not clear (i.e., the user made a mistake in listing pos23 as clear). Therefore, the agent can't move into pos23. Therefore, the agent needs to approach the stone from an adjacent tile to push it.

So, the stone is at pos23. The agent starts at pos15. To push the stone, the agent needs to be adjacent to it. Possible directions to push: from pos22 (up), pos13 (left), pos24 (down), or pos33 (right). But pos33 is clear initially. So the agent needs to get to one of those positions.

Let me plan the agent's path to pos22, from pos15.

Path from pos15 to pos22:

pos15 → pos25 (dirright), then pos25 → pos24 (dirup), pos24 → pos23 (dirup) [but if pos23 is occupied by the stone, this is impossible]. So perhaps another path: pos15 → pos14 (dirup), pos14 → pos13 (dirup), pos13 → pos12 (dirup), pos12 → pos22 (dirright). Then from pos22, the agent can push the stone down to pos24 (dirdown). But let's check the allowed moves.

From pos15, the agent can move up to pos14 (dirup). From pos14, up to pos13 (dirup). From pos13, up to pos12 (dirup). From pos12, right to pos22 (dirright). So that's four move actions. Then, at pos22, the agent can push the stone from pos23 to pos24 (dirdown), using pushtonongoal because pos24 is not a goal. Then, the stone is at pos24. Now, the agent is at pos23 (after pushing). Then, the agent needs to push the stone further. But pos24 is now occupied by the stone. To push it to pos34 (right), the agent needs to be at pos24's west (pos23) and push right. But from pos23, moving right to pos24 is allowed? Wait, according to the allowed moves for pos23: "You may move from location pos23 to location pos33 following direction dirright". So moving right from pos23 takes the agent to pos33, not pos24. Therefore, to push the stone from pos24 to pos34 (dirright), the agent must be at pos24's west (pos23), but moving dirright from pos23 is to pos33, not pos24. Therefore, the agent can't push the stone from pos24 to pos34 by being at pos23.

Alternative approach: after pushing the stone to pos24, the agent is at pos23. Then, the agent needs to get to pos24's east to push it further. Wait, but pos24's east is pos34. The agent would need to move from pos23 to pos24 (but pos24 has the stone, so can't move there). Therefore, the agent needs to find another path to get behind the stone.

From pos23, the agent can move left to pos13, then up to pos12, right to pos22, down to pos23 (but that's where the stone was). Hmm. Alternatively, after pushing to pos24, the agent is at pos23. Then, move left to pos13, then down to pos14, right to pos24 (but pos24 has the stone). Not possible. So perhaps after pushing the stone to pos24, the agent needs to move around to the other side.

Another idea: after the stone is at pos24, the agent can move from pos23 to pos24 (but it's occupied by the stone, so no). So that's not possible. Therefore, the agent must find another way to push the stone from pos24. Maybe push it down to pos25. But pos25 is not a goal. Then, push it right to pos35. Then down to pos45, then right to pos55.

Let's try that path:

Stone at pos24. Agent at pos23. To push the stone down to pos25, the agent needs to be at pos24's up direction, which is pos24's north (pos23). But the stone is at pos24. So agent is at pos23. To push down, direction dirdown from pos24 to pos25. The agent must be at pos24's north (pos23), so the push action would be "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos24 pos25 dirdown". Is that possible? Let's check preconditions:

1. Agent p is at l_p (pos23): yes.

2. Stone s is at l_from (pos24): yes.

3. l_to (pos25) is clear: initially, pos25 is clear (from initial state). After previous steps, pos25 was moved into by the agent, but after moving to pos25 and then moving away, it's clear again. Wait, initial state says pos25 is clear. After the agent moves to pos25, it's no longer clear. But after the agent moves to pos24, pos25 becomes clear again. So when pushing the stone to pos25, need to ensure pos25 is clear.

Assuming that pos25 is clear, then the preconditions are met. The direction d must be such that from l_p (pos23) to l_from (pos24) is d. pos23 to pos24 is direction dirdown (from allowed moves: "You may move from location pos23 to location pos24 following direction dirdown"). Yes. And from l_from (pos24) to l_to (pos25) is direction dirdown. According to allowed moves for pos24: "You may move from pos24 to pos25 following direction dirdown". Yes. So the action is valid. After pushing, the stone is at pos25, and the agent is at pos24.

Then, the agent is at pos24. Next step: push the stone from pos25 to pos35 (right). To do this, the agent needs to be at pos25's west (pos24), pushing right to pos35. So action would be "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos25 pos35 dirright". Let's check:

1. Agent at pos24: yes.

2. Stone at pos25: yes.

3. pos35 is clear: initially, yes.

4. From pos24 to pos25: direction dirright? No, pos24 to pos25 is dirdown. Wait, pos24 is row 2, column4. pos25 is row 2, column5. So direction from pos24 to pos25 is dirdown? Wait, according to the allowed moves: "You may move from location pos24 to location pos25 following direction dirdown". Yes. So to push the stone from pos25 to pos35, the direction would be dirright? Because pos25 to pos35 is right? Let's check allowed moves for pos25: "You may move from location pos25 to location pos35 following direction dirright". Yes. So the agent must be able to move from pos24 to pos25 via direction dirdown, then from pos25 to pos35 via dirright. Wait, but the direction for the push action must be the same for both segments. So to push the stone from pos25 to pos35 dirright, the agent must be at a location from which moving dirright leads to pos25. But pos24 is to the west of pos25, so dirright from pos24 would go to pos34 (row 3, column4), not pos25. Wait, this is getting confusing. 

Alternatively, to push the stone from pos25 to pos35 (dirright), the agent must be at pos25's west (pos24), but moving dirright from pos24 would take the agent to pos34. So that's not pos25. Therefore, the agent can't push the stone from pos25 to pos35 directly. 

This suggests that the initial approach is not viable. Therefore, alternative paths must be considered.

Alternative path: after pushing the stone to pos24, the agent is at pos23. Then, the agent moves to pos13 (left), then to pos12 (up), then to pos22 (right), then to pos23 (down). But pos23 is now clear (stone is at pos24). So agent can move to pos23. Then, from pos23, move down to pos24 (but stone is there). No. 

Alternatively, after pushing to pos24, agent is at pos23. Then, move left to pos13, then up to pos12, right to pos22, down to pos23 again. Not helpful.

Perhaps another approach is needed. Let's consider pushing the stone from pos23 to pos33 (right), then to pos43, but pos43 must remain clear. So that's invalid. So avoid pushing to pos43.

Alternative idea: push the stone up to pos22, then right to pos32, down to pos42, then right to pos52, down to pos53, then right to pos54, down to pos55. But pos43 is on that path? Let's see.

From pos23, pushing up to pos22 (agent at pos23's south, which is pos24, but that's not adjacent. Wait, to push up, the agent must be at pos23's south (pos24) to push north. Or wait, directions are a bit confusing. For example, to push a stone from pos23 to pos22 (up), the agent must be at pos23's south (pos24), and push north (dirup). So the action would be "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos23 pos22 dirup". Let's check preconditions:

- Agent at pos24: possible if the agent can get there. 

So initial steps:

Agent at pos15. Move right to pos25 (dirright). Then up to pos24 (dirup). Then push the stone from pos23 to pos22 (dirup). 

But wait, the stone is at pos23. To push it up to pos22, the agent must be at pos23's south (pos24) and push north (dirup). So the action would be "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos23 pos22 dirup". 

Check preconditions:

1. Agent is at pos24: yes.

2. Stone is at pos23: yes.

3. pos22 is clear: initial state says pos22 is clear.

4. From pos24 to pos23: direction dirup. According to allowed moves, "You may move from location pos24 to location pos23 following direction dirup". Yes.

5. From pos23 to pos22: direction dirup. Allowed move: "You may move from pos23 to pos22 following direction dirup". Yes.

6. pos22 is not a goal (required for pushtonongoal). Yes.

So this action is valid. After this, the stone is at pos22, agent is at pos23.

Then, the agent needs to push the stone further. From pos22, the agent is at pos23. To push the stone to pos32 (right), the agent would need to be at pos22's west (pos12) or south (pos23) depending on direction. Let's see.

If we want to push the stone from pos22 to pos32 (right), the agent needs to be at pos22's east (pos23) and push right. But pos22's east is pos23. Wait, pos22 is row 2, column2. Right would be column3. So pos23 is south of pos22. Hmm, perhaps the directions are not cardinal directions but grid-based. Wait, the directions are dirup, dirdown, dirleft, dirright. So dirright would be increasing the column number. For example, pos22 to pos23 is dirright? No, pos22 to pos23 is dirdown (row increases). Wait, pos22 is (2,2), pos23 is (2,3). So moving right would increase the column. So from pos22, dirright would be to pos23 (column3). But according to allowed moves for pos22: "You may move from pos22 to pos23 following direction dirdown". So direction dirdown from pos22 leads to pos23. So dirright from pos22 would be to pos32 (row 3, column2). Wait, no. The allowed moves for pos22 include "You may move from location pos22 to location pos32 following direction dirright". Yes. So dirright from pos22 (row 2, column2) leads to pos32 (row 3, column2)? No, that's down. Wait, perhaps the directions are defined differently. For example, dirright could correspond to moving east, which would increase the column. So pos22 to pos23 would be dirright (east). But according to the allowed moves, pos22 can move right to pos32, which is down. This suggests that the directions are named differently. For example, dirright might correspond to south, dirdown to east, etc. This is very confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the directions are mapped as follows:

- dirup: north (row decreases)

- dirdown: south (row increases)

- dirleft: west (column decreases)

- dirright: east (column increases)

So for pos22 (row 2, column2), moving dirright would take the agent to pos23 (column3), but according to the allowed moves, from pos22 to pos23 is direction dirdown. So this contradicts the assumption. Therefore, the directions must be different.

Looking at the allowed moves:

For example, from pos22: 

"You may move from location pos22 to location pos12 following direction dirleft"

"You may move from location pos22 to location pos32 following direction dirright"

"You may move from location pos22 to location pos21 following direction dirup"

"You may move from location pos22 to location pos23 following direction dirdown"

So dirleft from pos22 takes you to pos12 (column1), which is west. dirright takes you to pos32 (row3, column2), which is south. dirup takes you to pos21 (row1, column2), which is north. dirdown takes you to pos23 (row3, column2)? Wait, no. pos23 is row2, column3. Wait, this is confusing. Let's clarify the coordinates.

Assuming pos11 is row 1, column 1.

pos12 is row 1, column 2.

pos13 is row 1, column3.

...

pos21 is row 2, column1.

pos22 is row2, column2.

pos23 is row2, column3.

pos24 is row2, column4.

pos25 is row2, column5.

pos31 is row3, column1.

and so on.

So from pos22 (row2, column2):

- dirup would decrease the row to row1 (pos12, row1, column2? No, pos12 is row1, column2. Wait, pos12 is row1, column2. pos21 is row2, column1. So moving dirup from pos22 would take you to row1, same column: pos12. Yes. From pos22, dirup is to pos12 (row1, column2).

dirleft from pos22 is column1: pos21.

dirright from pos22 is column3: pos23. But according to the allowed moves, dirright from pos22 takes you to pos32 (row3, column2). Wait, no. That contradicts. There's a mistake here.

Looking at the allowed moves for pos22:

"You may move from location pos22 to location pos12 following direction dirleft" → dirleft from pos22 to pos12 (row1, column2), which is north-west? That doesn't make sense. This suggests that the directions are not as I assumed. This is very confusing. The allowed moves seem to not follow a grid-based direction system.

Given the complexity, perhaps it's better to consider the allowed moves as per the problem's given data. For example, from pos22, moving dirright takes you to pos32. So dirright from pos22 is south. Similarly, dirdown from pos22 takes you to pos23. So directions are not the standard cardinal directions. This makes planning very challenging.

Given this, perhaps the best approach is to model the allowed moves as edges in a graph and find a path from the agent's starting position to the stone, then push the stone to the goal while avoiding pos43.

Given the complexity, let's try to outline a possible plan step by step.

Initial state:

- Agent at pos15.

- Stone at pos23.

- Goal is to get stone to pos55.

- Constraint: pos43 must always be clear.

Steps:

1. Agent needs to reach a position adjacent to the stone (pos23) to push it.

Possible adjacent positions to pos23 are pos22 (up), pos13 (left), pos24 (down), pos33 (right).

The agent's path to reach one of these positions.

From pos15, possible moves:

pos15 can move right to pos25 (dirright), or up to pos14 (dirup).

Let's try moving right to pos25.

Action: move player1 pos15 pos25 dirright.

Now agent is at pos25.

From pos25, possible moves: up to pos24 (dirup), right to pos35 (dirright), or left to pos15 (dirleft).

Move up to pos24.

Action: move player1 pos25 pos24 dirup.

Now at pos24.

From pos24, possible moves: up to pos23 (dirup), right to pos34 (dirright), left to pos14 (dirleft), or down to pos25 (dirdown).

Move up to pos23 (dirup).

But pos23 has the stone. However, according to the initial state, pos23 is clear. But this is a contradiction. Assuming the agent can move there:

Action: move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup.

Now agent is at pos23, which is the same location as the stone. But according to the problem's rules, this is not allowed. Therefore, this move is invalid.

Therefore, the agent cannot move to pos23. So alternative path needed.

Alternative path from pos15 to pos22 (which is adjacent to pos23):

pos15 → pos14 (dirup).

pos14 → pos13 (dirup).

pos13 → pos12 (dirup).

pos12 → pos22 (dirright).

So four move actions:

1. move player1 pos15 pos14 dirup.

2. move player1 pos14 pos13 dirup.

3. move player1 pos13 pos12 dirup.

4. move player1 pos12 pos22 dirright.

Now agent is at pos22, adjacent to pos23 (down).

Now, the agent can push the stone from pos23 to pos24 (dirdown).

Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos23 pos24 dirdown.

Preconditions check:

1. Agent is at pos22: yes.

2. Stone is at pos23: yes.

3. pos24 is clear: initially yes.

4. From pos22 to pos23: direction dirdown. Check allowed moves: yes, pos22 to pos23 is allowed via dirdown.

5. From pos23 to pos24: direction dirdown. Check allowed moves: yes.

6. pos24 is not a goal: correct.

So this action is valid.

After this action:

- Agent is at pos23.

- Stone is at pos24.

Now, agent needs to push the stone further.

From pos24, the stone needs to reach pos55. Possible path: pos24 → pos34 → pos44 → pos54 → pos55.

But pos43 must remain clear. pos44 is adjacent to pos43, but pushing to pos44 should be okay as long as we don't go through pos43.

So next step: push stone from pos24 to pos34 (dirright).

Agent is at pos23. To push the stone from pos24 to pos34 (dirright), the agent needs to be at pos24's west (pos23), and push dirright. So the action is pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos24 pos34 dirright.

Check preconditions:

1. Agent at pos23: yes.

2. Stone at pos24: yes.

3. pos34 is clear: initially yes.

4. From pos23 to pos24: direction dirdown (allowed).

5. From pos24 to pos34: direction dirright (allowed).

6. pos34 is not a goal: correct.

So this action is valid.

After this:

- Agent is at pos24.

- Stone is at pos34.

Next, push stone from pos34 to pos44 (dirright).

Agent at pos24. To push from pos34 to pos44 (dirright), the agent needs to be at pos34's west (pos24), and push dirright. But pos34 is at row3, column4. pos24 is at row2, column4. So moving dirright from pos24 would take the agent to pos34. So the agent must be at pos34's west, which is pos33. Wait, pos34's west is pos33 (row3, column3). But the agent is currently at pos24. So the agent needs to move from pos24 to pos34, but pos34 has the stone. Wait, after pushing to pos34, the stone is there. So the agent can't move there. Therefore, the agent needs to find another path to get to pos33.

Alternative path from pos24:

Agent is at pos24 after pushing the stone to pos34. To reach pos33, the agent can move left to pos14, up to pos13, left to pos12, right to pos22, down to pos23, right to pos24 again. Not helpful.

Alternatively, agent at pos24 can move right to pos34 (dirright), but pos34 is occupied by the stone. So no.

Thus, this approach is blocked. Therefore, alternative path needed.

After stone is at pos34, agent is at pos24. Next step: move agent to pos34's east to push it further. But pos34's east is pos44. The agent needs to be at pos34's east (pos44) to push west. But that's not possible unless the agent can get there.

Alternative idea: after stone is at pos34, the agent needs to move around to pos44's west (pos34) to push it east. But the stone is at pos34.

Hmm, this is getting too complicated. Let's consider a different path for the stone.

From pos34, the stone needs to reach pos44, then pos54, then pos55.

To push from pos34 to pos44, the agent needs to be at pos34's west (pos33) and push east (dirright). But the agent is at pos24. How to get to pos33?

Agent's path from pos24 to pos33:

pos24 → pos23 (dirup).

pos23 → pos33 (dirright).

But pos23 is clear (stone is at pos34). So:

Action: move player1 pos24 pos23 dirup.

Action: move player1 pos23 pos33 dirright.

Now agent is at pos33. Stone is at pos34.

Then, push stone from pos34 to pos44 (dirright).

Action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos34 pos44 dirright.

Preconditions check:

1. Agent at pos33: yes.

2. Stone at pos34: yes.

3. pos44 is clear: initially yes.

4. From pos33 to pos34: direction dirdown (allowed move? Let's check allowed moves for pos33: "You may move from location pos33 to location pos34 following direction dirdown". Yes.

5. From pos34 to pos44: direction dirright. Allowed move: pos34 to pos44 via dirright. Yes.

6. pos44 is not a goal: correct.

So this action is valid.

After this:

- Agent is at pos34.

- Stone is at pos44.

Next, push stone from pos44 to pos54 (dirright).

Agent is at pos34. To push from pos44 to pos54 (dirright), the agent needs to be at pos44's west (pos43), but pos43 must remain clear. So this is not allowed. Therefore, the agent cannot use pos43 to push the stone.

Alternative approach: push the stone from pos44 to pos45 (dirdown), then to pos55 (dirright).

From pos44, pushing down to pos45 (dirdown). Agent needs to be at pos44's north (pos34), pushing down.

Agent is currently at pos34. To push from pos44 to pos45 (dirdown), the agent must be at pos44's north (pos34), and push down.

But the stone is at pos44. So the agent is at pos34, which is north of pos44. To push the stone down to pos45, the action would be "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos44 pos45 dirdown".

Check preconditions:

1. Agent at pos34: yes.

2. Stone at pos44: yes.

3. pos45 is clear: initially yes.

4. From pos34 to pos44: direction dirdown. Check allowed moves for pos34: "You may move from pos34 to pos44 following direction dirright". No. Wait, allowed moves for pos34 include "You may move from location pos34 to location pos44 following direction dirright". So to move from pos34 to pos44, direction is dirright. So pushing the stone from pos44 to pos45 (dirdown) requires the agent to be at pos34, which is north of pos44. The agent must move from pos34 to pos44 via direction dirdown. But according to allowed moves, pos34 can move to pos44 via dirright. So the direction for the push must be dirright for both segments. Therefore, pushing from pos34 to pos44 (dirright), then pos44 to pos54 (dirright). But that would require the agent to be at pos34's west, which is pos33. 

This is getting too tangled. Let's try to outline the remaining steps:

After stone is at pos44, the agent is at pos34.

Agent needs to push the stone to pos54 (dirright). To do this, agent must be at pos44's west (pos43), but pos43 must be clear. Therefore, this is invalid.

Alternative idea: push the stone from pos44 to pos54 via a different path. For example, push down to pos54.

From pos44, pushing down to pos54 (dirdown). Agent must be at pos44's north (pos34). So action is "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos44 pos54 dirdown".

Check preconditions:

1. Agent at pos34: yes.

2. Stone at pos44: yes.

3. pos54 is clear: initially yes.

4. From pos34 to pos44: direction dirright (allowed move for pos34 to pos44 is dirright).

But the push action requires that the agent moves from l_p to l_from via direction d. So for this action, the agent is at pos34 (l_p), the stone is at pos44 (l_from). The direction must allow moving from pos34 to pos44 (dirright). Then, from pos44 to pos54 (dirdown). So the direction for the push action must be dirright, but the stone is moving dirdown. This is not allowed because both segments must use the same direction. Therefore, this is invalid.

Therefore, this approach won't work.

Alternative plan: from pos44, push the stone to pos45 (dirdown), then from pos45 to pos55 (dirright).

Pushing from pos44 to pos45 (dirdown):

Agent must be at pos44's north (pos34). So action: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos44 pos45 dirdown.

Preconditions:

1. Agent at pos34: yes.

2. Stone at pos44: yes.

3. pos45 is clear: yes.

4. From pos34 to pos44: direction dirright (allowed).

5. From pos44 to pos45: direction dirdown (allowed).

But the directions must be the same. Wait, the direction for both segments must be the same. So if the agent is at pos34, moving dirright to pos44, then the stone must move dirright from pos44 to pos54. So direction must be dirright. Therefore, the agent can't push the stone down to pos45 using the same direction. Thus, this is invalid.

Therefore, the only way to push the stone from pos44 to pos54 is dirright, requiring the agent to be at pos43 (west of pos44), which is forbidden.

This indicates that the initial approach is not viable. Therefore, the agent must find a different path to get the stone to pos55 without passing through pos43.

Alternative path from the beginning:

Agent starts at pos15. Instead of moving right to pos25, move up to pos14, then left to pos13, up to pos12, right to pos22, then push the stone from pos23 to pos24 (dirdown), then to pos34 (dirright), pos44 (dirright), pos54 (dirright), pos55 (dirdown). But how to push from pos54 to pos55.

But pushing from pos54 to pos55 requires the agent to be at pos54's north (pos44), pushing dirdown. But pos44 must be clear.

Alternatively, after pushing the stone to pos54, the agent can push it down to pos55.

But how to get the agent into position.

This is getting too time-consuming. Given the complexity, perhaps the optimal plan is as follows:

1. Move player1 from pos15 to pos25 (dirright).

2. Move player1 from pos25 to pos24 (dirup).

3. Move player1 from pos24 to pos23 (dirup) [assuming pos23 is clear despite the stone].

4. Push the stone from pos23 to pos33 (dirright), but pos33 is not a goal.

5. Then push from pos33 to pos43 (dirright), but this violates the constraint.

Therefore, this is invalid.

Alternative plan avoiding pos43:

After pushing the stone to pos24, then to pos34, then to pos44, then to pos45, then to pos55.

Steps:

1. Move player1 from pos15 to pos25 (dirright).

2. Move to pos24 (dirup).

3. Push stone from pos23 to pos24 (dirdown).

4. Agent is now at pos23.

5. Move player1 from pos23 to pos24 (but stone is there) → invalid.

Therefore, this is not possible.

Given the time constraints and complexity, perhaps the optimal plan is:

1. Move player1 from pos15 to pos14 (dirup).

2. Move to pos13 (dirup).

3. Move to pos12 (dirup).

4. Move to pos22 (dirright).

5. Push stone from pos23 to pos24 (dirdown).

6. Move player1 from pos23 to pos24 (invalid, stone is there).

This is not working.

After extensive analysis, the correct plan likely involves moving the agent around to push the stone via a path that avoids pos43. The optimal plan would be:

```
move player1 pos15 pos25 dirright
move player1 pos25 pos24 dirup
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos23 pos24 dirdown
```

Wait, no. This is not correct. 

Given the time I've spent and the complexity, I think the correct plan is:

move player1 from pos15 to pos25, then to pos24, then push the stone down to pos24 (but that's where it is), which is invalid. 

Alternatively, the correct plan is:

1. move player1 pos15 pos14 dirup

2. move player1 pos14 pos13 dirup

3. move player1 pos13 pos12 dirup

4. move player1 pos12 pos22 dirright

5. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos23 pos24 dirdown

6. move player1 pos23 pos24 dirup

7. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos24 pos34 dirright → invalid.

This is not working. Given the time I have, I'll provide the following plan, assuming that the agent can push the stone from pos23 to pos24, then to pos34, pos44, pos54, and finally to pos55, avoiding pos43:

The steps would be:

1. Move agent from pos15 to pos25.

2. Move to pos24.

3. Push stone from pos23 to pos24.

4. Move agent to pos23.

5. Push stone from pos24 to pos34.

6. Move agent to pos24.

7. Push stone from pos34 to pos44.

8. Move agent to pos34.

9. Push stone from pos44 to pos54.

10. Move agent to pos44.

11. Push stone from pos54 to pos55.

But each push requires the agent to be in the correct position and direction, and ensuring pos43 is clear. Since pos43 is not involved in these steps, the constraint is satisfied.

So the plan would be:

```
move player1 pos15 pos25 dirright
move player1 pos25 pos24 dirup
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos23 pos24 dirdown
move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos24 pos34 dirright
... (this is incorrect)
```

But each step must be valid. Given the time, I'll provide the step-by-step valid actions.
