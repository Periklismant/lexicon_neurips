Let me understand the problem:

1. We have a 2D grid with positions labeled as posXY, where X is the row and Y is the column.
2. The agent (player1) starts at position pos15.
3. There's one stone (stone1) at position pos23.
4. The only goal location is pos55.
5. The task is to move the stone to the goal location.

Let's think about the approach:

1. I need to move the agent to a position adjacent to the stone.
2. Then, I need to push the stone towards the goal location (pos55).
3. I should use the appropriate actions: move, pushtogoal, or pushtonongoal.

Let me first visualize the grid:

```
(1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (1,4) (1,5)
(2,1) (2,2) (2,3) (2,4) (2,5)
(3,1) (3,2) (3,3) (3,4) (3,5)
(4,1) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) (4,5)
(5,1) (5,2) (5,3) (5,4) (5,5)
```

The agent starts at (1,5), and the stone is at (2,3). The goal is at (5,5).

I need to move the agent to a position from which it can push the stone. Let's see the possible directions the agent can push the stone:

From (2,2), the agent can push the stone right (to (2,4)).
From (2,4), the agent can push the stone left (to (2,2)).
From (1,3), the agent can push the stone up (to (1,3)).
From (3,3), the agent can push the stone down (to (3,3)).

I'll try to get the stone to the goal position (5,5) by pushing it down and to the right.

Let's plan the steps:

1. Move the agent from (1,5) to (1,3) (to push the stone down).
2. Push the stone from (2,3) to (3,3).
3. Move the agent to (3,2).
4. Push the stone from (3,3) to (4,3).
5. Move the agent to (4,2).
6. Push the stone from (4,3) to (5,3).
7. Move the agent to (5,2).
8. Push the stone from (5,3) to (5,4).
9. Move the agent to (5,3).
10. Push the stone from (5,4) to (5,5) (goal).

Actually let's be careful. Let me double check the movement actions. There seems to be a potentially confusing dirdown and dirup. Let's look at some examples to understand them clearly:

"You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright" - This means moving from (1,1) to (2,1), i.e., moving to the right.
"You may move from location pos11 to location pos12 following direction dirdown" - This means moving from (1,1) to (1,2), i.e., moving down.
"You may move from location pos12 to location pos13 following direction dirdown" - This means moving from (1,2) to (1,3), also moving down.

Hmm, that seems a bit inconsistent with the grid I visualized. Let me rethink this. 

"You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright" - Moving from pos11 to pos21 means moving from row 1, column 1 to row 2, column 1, which is moving down (or right, depending on the visualization). But the direction is dirright, which is confusing.

Let me look at more examples to understand the structure of the positions, particularly on how posXY is interpreted:

"You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright" - Moving from pos11 to pos21.
"You may move from location pos11 to location pos12 following direction dirdown" - Moving from pos11 to pos12.
"You may move from location pos12 to location pos22 following direction dirright" - Moving from pos12 to pos22.

If we interpret posXY as "row X, column Y", then:
- Moving from pos11 to pos21 would be moving down a row, but the direction is dirright.
- Moving from pos11 to pos12 would be moving right a column, but the direction is dirdown.

This is inconsistent. 

On the other hand, if we interpret posXY as "column X, row Y", then:
- Moving from pos11 to pos21 would be moving right a column, which matches dirright.
- Moving from pos11 to pos12 would be moving down a row, which matches dirdown.

This is consistent. So, I think posXY should be interpreted as "column X, row Y".

Given this understanding, let's re-visualize the grid:

```
(1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (4,1) (5,1)
(1,2) (2,2) (3,2) (4,2) (5,2)
(1,3) (2,3) (3,3) (4,3) (5,3)
(1,4) (2,4) (3,4) (4,4) (5,4)
(1,5) (2,5) (3,5) (4,5) (5,5)
```

The agent starts at (1,5), and the stone is at (2,3). The goal is at (5,5).

Actually, let me visualize the grid with the actual values to be sure (Ugh, actually wait, the first hypothesis is correct. posRC is row R, column C. This is evident from checking the allowed movements.):

```
pos11 pos12 pos13 pos14 pos15
pos21 pos22 pos23 pos24 pos25
pos31 pos32 pos33 pos34 pos35
pos41 pos42 pos43 pos44 pos45
pos51 pos52 pos53 pos54 pos55
```

And the starting configuration:

```
pos11 pos12 pos13 pos14 player1
pos21 pos22 stone1 pos24 pos25
pos31 pos32 pos33  pos34 pos35
pos41 pos42 pos43  pos44 pos45
pos51 pos52 pos53  pos54 goal
```

We need to get the stone from pos23 to pos55 (the goal). 

Okay, I think I've got the grid structure now. Let's plan the steps to move the stone to the goal:

If we are trying to push the stone from position pos23 to the goal at pos55, we'll need to navigate the stone through the grid. We can push the stone in four directions: up, down, left, or right, but the stone can only be pushed (not pulled).

We want to push the stone in a path towards the goal. A possible path would be:
pos23 -> pos33 -> pos43 -> pos53 -> pos54 -> pos55

Let's figure out the sequence of actions to accomplish this:

1. First, the agent needs to move from pos15 to a position from which it can push the stone.
2. To push the stone from pos23 to pos33, the agent needs to be at pos13.
3. To push the stone from pos33 to pos43, the agent needs to be at pos23.
4. To push the stone from pos43 to pos53, the agent needs to be at pos33.
5. To push the stone from pos53 to pos54, the agent needs to be at pos52 (to push right).
6. To push the stone from pos54 to pos55, the agent needs to be at pos53 (to push down).

Let's go through the actions in detail:

1. Move the agent from pos15 to pos13:
   a. move player1 pos15 pos14 dirup
   b. move player1 pos14 pos13 dirup

2. Push the stone from pos23 to pos33:
   a. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos23 pos33 dirdown

3. Move the agent from pos23 (after pushing) to pos33 (from where we'll push next):
   a. move player1 pos23 pos33 dirdown

4. Push the stone from pos33 to pos43:
   a. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos43 pos53 dirdown

5. Move the agent from pos43 (after pushing) to pos53 (from where we'll push next). But this isn't the most direct path, since we want to push to the side, not down. Instead, we need to move to pos52:
   a. move player1 pos43 pos44 dirdown
   b. move player1 pos44 pos54 dirright
   c. move player1 pos54 pos53 dirup
   d. move player1 pos53 pos52 dirup

6. Push the stone from pos53 to pos54:
   a. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos52 pos53 pos54 dirdown

7. Move the agent from pos53 (after pushing) to pos53:
   a. move player1 pos53 pos43 dirleft
   b. move player1 pos43 pos53 dirright

8. Push the stone from pos54 to pos55 (goal):
   a. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos53 pos54 pos55 dirdown

Oops, I think I've made a mistake in my reasoning here. Let's go back to the navigation directions and make sure I understand them correctly. Let's look at the allowed moves:

"You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright"
"You may move from location pos11 to location pos12 following direction dirdown"

If we interpret the positions as posRC (row R, column C), then the first move is moving from (1,1) to (2,1), which is moving one row down, but the direction is dirright. The second move is from (1,1) to (1,2), which is moving one column to the right, but the direction is dirdown.

This is inconsistent. Let me re-check.

Actually, if we interpret posRC as (column R, row C), then the first move is from (R=1, C=1) to (R=2, C=1), which is moving one column to the right, matching dirright. The second move is from (R=1, C=1) to (R=1, C=2), which is moving one row down, matching dirdown.

This is consistent. So, posRC seems to be (column R, row C). Let's revise our grid:

```
pos11 pos21 pos31 pos41 pos51
pos12 pos22 pos32 pos42 pos52
pos13 pos23 pos33 pos43 pos53
pos14 pos24 pos34 pos44 pos54
pos15 pos25 pos35 pos45 pos55
```

And the starting configuration:

```
pos11 pos21 pos31 pos41 pos51
pos12 pos22 pos32 pos42 pos52
pos13 stone1 pos33 pos43 pos53
pos14 pos24 pos34 pos44 pos54
player1 pos25 pos35 pos45 goal
```

Actually, I think this is not the expected interpretation either. When I think of a 2D grid, the first coordinate usually corresponds to the column and the second to the row, or vice versa. Let's re-check some moves to be 100% sure:

"You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright"
"You may move from location pos11 to location pos12 following direction dirdown"
"You may move from location pos12 to location pos22 following direction dirright"
"You may move from location pos12 to location pos11 following direction dirup"
"You may move from location pos12 to location pos13 following direction dirdown"

If posXY corresponds to (row X, column Y):
1. Moving from pos11 to pos21 means moving from (1,1) to (2,1), which can be seen as going one row down, but the direction is dirright.
2. Moving from pos11 to pos12 means moving from (1,1) to (1,2), which can be seen as going one column to the right, but the direction is dirdown.

This interpretation doesn't align with the directions.

If posXY corresponds to (column X, row Y):
1. Moving from pos11 to pos21 means moving from (1,1) to (2,1), which can be seen as going one column to the right, matching dirright.
2. Moving from pos11 to pos12 means moving from (1,1) to (1,2), which can be seen as going one row down, matching dirdown.

This interpretation aligns well with the directions, so I think posXY should be read as "position at column X, row Y". Let's stick with this interpretation.

So, our grid looks like:

```
pos11 pos21 pos31 pos41 pos51
pos12 pos22 pos32 pos42 pos52
pos13 pos23 pos33 pos43 pos53
pos14 pos24 pos34 pos44 pos54
pos15 pos25 pos35 pos45 pos55
```

With the agent at pos15 and the stone at pos23.

Let me double-check more movement directions to be sure:

"You may move from location pos15 to location pos25 following direction dirright"
"You may move from location pos15 to location pos14 following direction dirup"

If pos15 is (1,5) (column 1, row 5), then moving to pos25 is moving one column to the right, which aligns with the "dirright" direction. And moving to pos14 means moving one row up, which aligns with "dirup". This is consistent.

But actually, wait a minute, let me think more about interpretations:

Let's think about movement in a 2D grid. If I go from (1,1) to (2,1), I'm moving right. If I go from (1,1) to (1,2), I'm moving down. But the action descriptions say:

"You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright"
"You may move from location pos11 to location pos12 following direction dirdown"

This directly maps to:
- pos11 to pos21 is going right
- pos11 to pos12 is going down

Actually, it sounds like posRC is row R, column C, which is the correct interpretation:

```
pos11 pos12 pos13 pos14 pos15
pos21 pos22 pos23 pos24 pos25
pos31 pos32 pos33 pos34 pos35
pos41 pos42 pos43 pos44 pos45
pos51 pos52 pos53 pos54 pos55
```

With this understanding, the agent starts at pos15 (row 1, column 5), and the stone is at pos23 (row 2, column 3). The goal is at pos55 (row 5, column 5).

Let me adjust my plan based on this understanding.

Given the current state, here's a possible path to move the stone from pos23 to pos55:
pos23 -> pos33 -> pos43 -> pos53 -> pos54 -> pos55

Let's go step-by-step:

1. First, the agent needs to move from pos15 to a position from which it can push the stone.
2. To push the stone from pos23 to pos33, the agent needs to be at pos13.
3. To push the stone from pos33 to pos43, the agent needs to be at pos23.
4. To push the stone from pos43 to pos53, the agent needs to be at pos33.
5. To push the stone from pos53 to pos54, the agent needs to be at pos52 (to push right).
6. To push the stone from pos54 to pos55, the agent needs to be at pos53 (to push right).

Let's go through the actions in detail:

1. Move the agent from pos15 to pos13:
   a. move player1 pos15 pos14 dirup
   b. move player1 pos14 pos13 dirup

Wait, now I'm second-guessing the directions:
"Pos15 is at column 5, row 1" is one interpretation.
"Pos15 is at row 1, column 5" is another.

Let's check a few more examples to be absolutely sure:

"You may move from location pos55 to location pos45 following direction dirleft"
"You may move from location pos55 to location pos54 following direction dirup"

If the positions are (row, column), then pos55 is at row 5, column 5. Moving to pos45 means moving to row 4, column 5, which is moving up, but the direction is dirleft (which is incorrect). And moving to pos54 means moving to row 5, column 4, which is moving left, but the direction is dirup (which is also incorrect).

If the positions are (column, row), then pos55 is at column 5, row 5. Moving to pos45 means moving to column 4, row 5, which is moving left, matching dirleft. And moving to pos54 means moving to column 5, row 4, which is moving up, matching dirup. This interpretation is consistent with the directions.

So, I'm confident now that posXY is (column X, row Y).

Wait, actually the start state says:

"player1 is at location pos15"
"stone1 is at location pos23"
"pos55 is a goal location"

And looking at the allowed movements, we can see:

"You may move from location pos14 to location pos24 following direction dirright"
"You may move from location pos14 to location pos13 following direction dirup"
"You may move from location pos14 to location pos15 following direction dirdown"

This means that from pos14, I can move right to pos24, up to pos13, or down to pos15. If we visualize the grid with y increasing as we go down (with pos11 at the top left), these movements make perfect sense. Let's stick with this interpretation:

```
pos11 pos12 pos13 pos14 pos15
pos21 pos22 pos23 pos24 pos25
pos31 pos32 pos33 pos34 pos35
pos41 pos42 pos43 pos44 pos45
pos51 pos52 pos53 pos54 pos55
```

So, the agent is at pos15 (row 1, column 5), the stone is at pos23 (row 2, column 3), and the goal is at pos55 (row 5, column 5).

Let's proceed with the planning.

Let's check the allowed moves from pos15:

- First, the agent (player1) needs to move from pos15 to a position from which it can push the stone.
- To push the stone from pos23 to a position moving towards pos55 (the goal), the agent can push it down to pos33.
- To do this, the agent needs to be at pos13. Let's see how the agent can get from pos15 to pos13.

From pos15, the agent can move:
- Left to pos14 (using move player1 pos15 pos14 dirup)
- Right to pos25 (using move player1 pos15 pos25 dirright)

I'll move the agent to pos13 first to push the stone down:
1. move player1 pos15 pos14 dirup
2. move player1 pos14 pos13 dirup

Now, the agent is at pos13 and can push the stone from pos23 to pos33:
3. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos23 pos33 dirdown

After pushing, the agent is at pos23. Now, we want to push the stone from pos33 to pos43:
4. move player1 pos23 pos33 dirdown
5. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos43 pos53 dirdown

After pushing, the agent is at pos43. Now, we want to push the stone from pos53 to pos54:
6. move player1 pos43 pos53 dirdown
7. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos53 pos54 pos55 dirright

Wait, this isn't right. Let me recheck my reasoning. We can't push the stone directly from pos43 to pos53 and then to pos55. The stone is at pos43 after step 5. We need to get it to pos55, which means we need to push it to pos53, then to pos54, and finally to pos55.

Let's revise:

5. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos43 pos53 dirdown

That's not right either. If the stone is at pos33 and the agent is at pos23, we push it to pos43 (not pos53):
5. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos43 dirdown

After pushing, the agent is at pos33 and the stone is at pos43. Next, we want to push the stone from pos43 to pos53:
6. move player1 pos33 pos43 dirdown
7. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos53 dirdown

After pushing, the agent is at pos43 and the stone is at pos53. Next, we want to push the stone from pos53 to pos54:
8. move player1 pos43 pos53 dirdown
9. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos53 pos54 dirright

After pushing, the agent is at pos53 and the stone is at pos54. Finally, we want to push the stone from pos54 to pos55 (the goal):
10. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos53 pos54 pos55 dirright

Now, I think my solution is correct. Let me verify the solution from the beginning to ensure it's optimal and valid:

Wait, actually I misspoke. Let's just make sure my understanding for the push actions is correct.

For "pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d":
- The agent must be at l_p.
- The stone must be at l_from.
- The location l_to must be a goal location.
- The agent must be able to move from l_p to l_from in the direction d.
- The agent must be able to move from l_from to l_to in the direction d.

After the action:
- The agent is at l_from.
- The stone is at l_to.
- l_p is clear.
- l_to is no longer clear.

For "pushtonongoal p s l_p l_from l_to d":
- The agent must be at l_p.
- The stone must be at l_from.
- The location l_to must not be a goal location.
- The agent must be able to move from l_p to l_from in the direction d.
- The agent must be able to move from l_from to l_to in the direction d.

After the action:
- The agent is at l_from.
- The stone is at l_to.
- l_p is clear.
- l_to is no longer clear.

I think I understand the actions correctly now. Let's refine the solution:

1. Move the agent from pos15 to pos13:
   a. move player1 pos15 pos14 dirup
   b. move player1 pos14 pos13 dirup

2. Push the stone from pos23 to pos33:
   a. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos23 pos33 dirdown

3. Move the agent from pos23 (after pushing) to pos33:
   a. move player1 pos23 pos33 dirdown

4. Push the stone from pos33 to pos43:
   a. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos43 pos53 dirdown

Hmm, I made a mistake again. Let me double check. After the "pushtonongoal" action, the agent will be at l_from, which means after pushing the stone from pos33 to pos43, the agent will be at pos33, not at pos43.

Let's adjust that.

After step 3, the agent is at pos33 and the stone is at pos43. We want to push the stone from pos43 to pos53, so the agent needs to be at pos33 before pushing.

4. Push the stone from pos43 to pos53:
   a. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos43 pos53 dirdown

Actually, there's something wrong with my understanding. If the agent is at pos33 and the stone is at pos43, and I want to push the stone, I need the agent to move to pos43 (which is where the stone is) and then push.

Let's take a step back. If the agent is at pos33 and the stone is at pos43, and I want to push the stone down, I'd need to move the agent to a position below pos43, which is pos53. But this doesn't make sense in the game mechanics because the agent can't move past the stone. It looks like the push direction is the direction in which the stone gets pushed, not the direction of the agent.

Let's check the preconditions for the push actions:

"pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": You may only perform this action if (i) agent p is at location l_p, (ii) stone s is at location l_from, (iii) location l_to is clear, (iv) you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d, (v) you can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d, and (vi) location l_to is a goal location.

So, for example, if the agent is at pos13 and the stone is at pos23, and I want to push the stone down, I'd use:
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos23 pos33 dirdown

This is because:
- The agent (player1) is at pos13.
- The stone (stone1) is at pos23.
- I want to push the stone down, which means it would go to pos33.
- I can get from pos13 to pos23 following dirdown.
- I can get from pos23 to pos33 following dirdown.
- pos33 is not a goal location (otherwise, I'd use pushtogoal).

This makes sense.

After performing this action, the agent is at pos23 and the stone is at pos33. Now, to push the stone from pos33 to pos43, I'd need to move the agent to a position from which it can push, which could be pos23.

But wait, according to the effects of "pushtonongoal", the agent is at l_from after the action. So, after pushing the stone from pos23 to pos33, the agent is at pos23, not at pos33. This seems correct, as if I push something, I'd end up where the thing I pushed was before.

Rereading the problem statement, when I use a push action, the agent ends up at l_from and the stone at l_to, which confirms my understanding.

Rethinking the problem:

1. The agent starts at pos15.
2. The stone is at pos23.
3. The goal is to get the stone to pos55.

First, I need to move the agent to a position from which it can push the stone.
Given the constraints, I might have to push the stone via several intermediate positions before it reaches the goal.

Let's approach it step by step:

1. Move the agent from pos15 to a position from which it can push the stone (pos23).
2. Push the stone to a position closer to the goal and continue.

I think we'd need to push the stone down rows till it reaches row 5, then push it to the right until it's at column 5, effectively reaching pos55.

So, from pos23, I'd want to push it down to pos33, then to pos43, then to pos53. After that, I'd push it right to pos54, and finally to pos55.

Alright, with this understanding, let's develop the plan step by step:

1. Move the agent to pos13 first to push the stone down. From pos15, if I check the movement, I think the path would be:
   a. move player1 pos15 pos14 dirup
   b. move player1 pos14 pos13 dirup

2. Now, the agent is at pos13, and the stone is at pos23. Push the stone down to pos33:
   a. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos23 pos33 dirdown

Let me check: After this, the agent is at pos23 (where the stone was), and the stone is at pos33.

3. To push the stone from pos33 to pos43, the agent needs to be at pos23. The agent is already at pos23 after the previous push, which is convenient.
   a. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos33 pos43 dirdown

After this, the agent is at pos33, and the stone is at pos43.

4. To push the stone from pos43 to pos53, the agent needs to be at pos33. The agent is already at pos33 after the previous push, which is again convenient.
   a. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos43 pos53 dirdown

After this, the agent is at pos43, and the stone is at pos53.

5. To push the stone from pos53 to pos54, the agent needs to be at pos53. But the agent is at pos43 after the previous push. So, I first need to move the agent:
   a. move player1 pos43 pos53 dirdown
   b. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos53 pos53 pos54 dirright

Wait, this isn't right. If the agent is at pos53 and the stone is also at pos53, how can I push?

Let me rethink this. The stone is at pos53 after step 4. To push it to pos54, the agent needs to be at a position that allows it to push the stone to the right. Given the agents at pos43 after step 4, the agent would need to move to a position where:
- It can get to pos53 following a direction d.
- From pos53, it can get to pos54 following the same direction d.

Given the allowed moves, the agent can move from pos43 to pos53 following dirdown. And from pos53, it can move to pos54 following dirright. These are different directions, so I can't use a direct push from pos43. I need to reposition the agent.

How about pushing from pos52? From pos52, I can get to pos53 following dirright, and from pos53, I can get to pos54 following the same direction.

So, from pos43, I need to move the agent to pos52. The path might be:
a. move player1 pos43 pos42 dirup
b. move player1 pos42 pos52 dirright

Now, the agent is at pos52, and the stone is at pos53. I can push the stone to the right:

After this, the agent is at pos53, and the stone is at pos54.

6. Finally, to push the stone from pos54 to pos55 (the goal), the agent needs to be at a position that allows it to push the stone to the right. Given the agent is at pos53 after step 5c, the agent would need to move to a position where:
- It can get to pos54 following a direction d.
- From pos54, it can get to pos55 following the same direction d.

From pos53, I can get to pos54 following dirright, and from pos54, I can get to pos55 following the same dirright. Perfect!

After this, the agent is at pos54, and the stone is at pos55, which is our goal! Mission accomplished!

Let's review the full plan:

1. move player1 pos15 pos14 dirup
2. move player1 pos14 pos13 dirup
3. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos23 pos33 dirdown
4. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos33 pos43 dirdown
5. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos43 pos53 dirdown
6. move player1 pos43 pos42 dirup
7. move player1 pos42 pos52 dirright

9. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos53 pos54 pos55 dirright

Check on optimality: This plan should be optimal, or at least close to optimal, because it follows a direct path for the stone to the goal (first down, then right). I don't see any obvious ways to reduce the number of steps, as the stone must traverse from pos23 to pos55, and there aren't any shortcuts or diagonal movements mentioned.

Actually, when we look at the allowed moves, the stone can go down a direct diagonal from pos23 to pos55. Let's see if we can exploit this to make the plan shorter:

From pos23, we want to push the stone to pos33, then pos43, then pos53, then pos54, and finally pos55. Let's see if there's a more direct path.

Given that the goal is at pos55, and the stone starts at pos23, a direct path would be:
pos23 -> pos33 -> pos43 -> pos53 -> pos54 -> pos55
(Move down, down, down, right, right)

I think the plan I've developed is pretty close to optimal. But let me double-check just to be sure.

Actually, maybe we can exploit the available moves more. For example, if the agent is at pos43 after the third push, to push the stone to pos54, and need to move to a position from which it can push the stone right. Given the allowed moves, I checked if the agent can move from pos43 to pos52, but that wasn't mentioned directly in the available moves. I'm using inferred moves based on the grid structure and the mentioned moves.

Instead, maybe there's a direct push from pos43 to pos54 that's allowed by the constraints. Let me see. For the agent to push the stone from pos53 to pos54, it needs to be at a position that allows it to push the stone to the right. From pos43, if the agent could directly push to the right, it would be very useful. But is there such a move in the constraints?

Given the constraints, it seems like the agent needs to be adjacent to the stone and push in a direction where there's an empty space. So, from pos43, the agent can't directly push the stone at pos53 to pos54. It would need to move to a position adjacent to pos53 first. So, my plan of moving the agent from pos43 to pos52 and then pushing the stone to the right still holds.

I think the plan I've developed is optimal, or at least close to optimal, given the constraints. Let's affirm our final plan:

1. move player1 pos15 pos14 dirup
2. move player1 pos14 pos13 dirup
3. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos23 pos33 dirdown
4. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos33 pos43 dirdown
5. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos43 pos53 dirdown
6. move player1 pos43 pos42 dirup
7. move player1 pos42 pos52 dirright
8. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos52 pos53 pos54 dirright
9. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos53 pos54 pos55 dirright

Great, I think this is the optimal plan.

Actually, let me do one more thing. Let's check if the path from pos15 to pos13 can be more direct. From pos15 to pos13, I'm currently taking the path:
move player1 pos15 pos14 dirup
move player1 pos14 pos13 dirup

But maybe there's a more direct path? Let me know if there's a move from pos15 to pos13 directly.

Checking the allowed moves, I don't see a direct move from pos15 to pos13 mentioned. The agent can move from pos15 to pos14 (dirup) and from pos14 to pos13 (dirup), which is the path I've chosen.

But let me check once more: If the agent is at pos15, is there a direct way to get to pos13 in a single action? Given the constraints, I think the move is indeed from pos15 to pos14, then to pos13. So, my plan uses the shortest path for that part.

I'm confident that my plan is optimal given the constraints. So, the final plan is:

1. move player1 pos15 pos14 dirup
2. move player1 pos14 pos13 dirup
3. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos23 pos33 dirdown
4. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos33 pos43 dirdown
5. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos43 pos53 dirdown
6. move player1 pos43 pos42 dirup
7. move player1 pos42 pos52 dirright
8. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos52 pos53 pos54 dirright
9. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos53 pos54 pos55 dirright

This plan should take the stone from pos23 to pos55 (the goal) in the most efficient manner, given the constraints.
