Okay, let me try to figure out how to solve this planning problem. So the goal is to get stone1, which is at pos23, to a goal location. The only goal location mentioned is pos55. The agent starts at pos15. Hmm, so the agent needs to move to where the stone is and push it all the way to pos55.

First, I need to check the movement paths. The agent is at pos15. Let's see the possible moves from pos15. According to the initial state, from pos15 you can move to pos25 via dirright or to pos14 via dirup. But pos25 is clear, and pos14 is clear. Wait, the agent is at pos15, so pos15 is not clear? Wait, the original state says "player1 is at location pos15" and "Location pos15 is clear". Wait, that seems contradictory. Wait, no. The original state lists "Location pos15 is clear" but also "player1 is at location pos15". Wait, but in the problem description, a location is clear if it doesn't have the agent or a stone. So if the agent is at pos15, then pos15 should not be clear. But according to the given original state, "Location pos15 is clear". That must be a mistake. Wait, looking back at the original state:

Under "original state of the world", it lists "player1 is at location pos15", and then "Location pos15 is clear". That's conflicting. But maybe there's a misunderstanding here. Wait, perhaps the "clear" refers to the presence of stones? Or maybe "clear" means that the agent can move there, but if the agent is at a location, it's not clear. Because according to the action effects, when you move, the from location becomes clear, and the to location is no longer clear. So if the agent is at pos15, pos15 should not be clear. But the initial state says pos15 is clear. Hmm, this might be a problem. But according to the given initial state, it's stated as such. Maybe there's an error in the problem description, but we have to work with what's given. Wait, the user probably made a typo. Let me check again.

Wait, in the original state, after listing all the locations, under "The original state of the world is the following", the first two are:

"player1 is at location pos15"

"stone1 is at location pos23"

Then, under "Location pos15 is clear" â€” but that can't be, because if the agent is at pos15, then it's not clear. Unless the "clear" condition is only about stones. Wait, but according to the problem description, each position may contain either the agent, a stone, or be empty. So "clear" would mean that it's empty. So if the agent is at pos15, then pos15 is not clear. But according to the given state, "Location pos15 is clear". That's conflicting. So perhaps there's a mistake here. But the problem states that the initial state is as given, so maybe in this scenario, even though the agent is at pos15, the location is considered clear. But that contradicts the action preconditions. For example, the "move" action requires that the destination is clear. If the agent is at pos15, but pos15 is considered clear, then someone else could move there. But that's not possible. Therefore, this must be an error in the problem statement. But perhaps in the problem's context, "clear" is defined as not having a stone. Let me check the problem description again.

Problem description says: "Each position on the grid may contain either the agent, a stone or be empty." So a location is clear if it is empty (no agent, no stone). So if the agent is at pos15, pos15 is not clear. Therefore, the initial state as given has a contradiction. But according to the problem's original state, it lists:

"player1 is at location pos15"

"Location pos15 is clear"

This is impossible. Therefore, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem's initial state. But since we have to work with the given information, maybe the "clear" status is only for stones, and the agent's presence doesn't affect it. But according to the action effects, moving to a location makes it no longer clear. So maybe the problem's initial state is correct in that the agent is at pos15, and pos15 is clear. But that would mean the agent can be present and the location is still considered clear, which contradicts the problem's own definitions. Hmm, this is confusing. But given that the problem states that the initial state includes both the agent being at pos15 and pos15 being clear, perhaps in this context, "clear" refers to the absence of stones. Wait, looking at the action preconditions:

For "move", the preconditions are that (i) the agent is at l_from, (ii) l_to is clear. So "clear" here would mean that there's no agent or stone at l_to. Because otherwise, if the agent is moving to a location, it must be clear (no agent or stone). Therefore, the initial state must have a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the initial state's "Location pos15 is clear" is a typo and should be "not clear". But given that the user has provided this, I have to proceed as if it's correct. Wait, but how can that be? Let me check the problem's original state again.

Looking back: the original state lists "player1 is at location pos15" and then later "Location pos15 is clear". So according to the problem, pos15 is clear even though the agent is there. That's conflicting with the domain's definitions. Unless "clear" here is defined differently. Maybe "clear" refers to the absence of stones, regardless of the agent. But according to the problem's action preconditions, when moving, the destination must be clear (no agent or stone). So in that case, if the agent is at pos15, then pos15 is not clear. Therefore, the problem's initial state is incorrect. However, since we must work with the given problem, perhaps the "Location pos15 is clear" is a mistake. But given that, perhaps in the problem, the agent's location is pos15, but pos15 is considered clear. So maybe in this problem, the agent's presence doesn't affect the "clear" status. But that's not consistent with the action effects. For example, the "move" action's effects make the to location not clear. Therefore, if the agent is at pos15, then pos15 should not be clear. But according to the problem, it is. This seems like a contradiction. But maybe the problem's initial state is correct, and we have to proceed under that assumption. Therefore, perhaps the agent can move from pos15 even though they are there. But this is confusing. Alternatively, maybe the "Location pos15 is clear" in the initial state is a typo. Maybe it's supposed to say that pos23 is clear (since the stone is at pos23). Wait, looking at the original state, the stone is at pos23, and "Location pos23 is clear" is not listed. Wait, the original state lists "Location pos23 is clear" as part of the initial state. Wait, no: under the original state's list, "stone1 is at location pos23", so pos23 is not clear. Then, in the list of clear locations, "Location pos23 is clear" is not present. Wait, looking at the original state:

After the player and stone positions, the clear locations are listed. The clear locations include pos11, pos12, ..., pos25, pos31, etc. But pos23 is not listed as clear. Because the stone is there. So "Location pos23 is clear" is not stated. However, at the very end, after listing all the non-goal locations, there's "Location pos15 is clear" and "Location pos23 is clear". Wait, no. Wait, the original state's last few lines are:

"pos55 is a goal location"

"You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright"

... (all the movement possibilities)

Then:

"pos11 is not a goal location"

... (all other positions except pos55 are not goal locations)

Then:

"Location pos15 is clear"

"Location pos23 is clear"

Wait, so after all that, they list "Location pos15 is clear" and "Location pos23 is clear". But earlier, the initial state says that player1 is at pos15 and stone1 is at pos23. Therefore, those two locations should not be clear. But according to the problem statement, they are. So this is a contradiction. Therefore, this must be an error in the problem statement. But since we have to proceed, perhaps the problem statement has a typo, and "Location pos15 is clear" and "Location pos23 is clear" are actually not part of the initial state. But the problem states that they are. Hmm. This is confusing. But perhaps the correct initial state is that pos15 is not clear (since the agent is there), and pos23 is not clear (since the stone is there). But according to the problem statement, they are. So maybe the problem statement is wrong. But as the solver, I have to work with the given information, even if it's conflicting. Therefore, perhaps the initial state is such that pos15 is clear (agent is there but it's considered clear) and pos23 is clear (stone is there but it's considered clear). But that's impossible according to the domain's definitions.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a misunderstanding. Maybe "clear" refers to the agent's ability to move there. So a location is clear if there's no stone, regardless of the agent. But the move action's preconditions require that the destination is clear, which would include not having the agent. So if the agent is at pos15, then pos15 is not clear, so moving into pos15 would be impossible unless it's cleared. But according to the problem's initial state, pos15 is clear. Therefore, there's a contradiction. But since the problem gives us this, perhaps we have to proceed as if pos15 is clear despite the agent being there, which would be a mistake in the problem's setup. But I'll proceed under the assumption that the problem's initial state is correct as given, even if contradictory. Therefore, the agent can move from pos15 to pos25 via dirright, because pos25 is clear. Let me check the movement possibilities. From pos15, the allowed moves are dirright to pos25 and dirup to pos14. Since pos25 is listed as clear, the agent can move there.

Wait, according to the original state's movement possibilities: "You may move from location pos15 to location pos25 following direction dirright" and "You may move from location pos15 to location pos14 following direction dirup". So moving to pos25 requires that pos25 is clear. According to the original state, pos25 is listed as clear (under the initial state's clear locations). Therefore, the agent can move from pos15 to pos25 via dirright.

So the first action could be "move player1 pos15 pos25 dirright". Then, after moving, pos15 becomes clear (since the agent leaves), and pos25 is no longer clear.

But wait, the initial state says pos15 is clear, which is where the agent is. So if the agent moves away, pos15 becomes clear again? But according to the problem's initial state, pos15 is already clear. So maybe this is just a mistake, but we have to proceed.

But the main goal is to move stone1 from pos23 to pos55. So the agent needs to get to pos23, then push the stone towards pos55.

Let's plan the path from the agent's starting position (pos15) to the stone's location (pos23). Then, push the stone to pos55.

So, starting at pos15, how to get to pos23.

Looking at the grid:

The grid seems to be 5x5, with pos11 at top-left (row 1, column 1), pos15 at top-right (row 1, column 5), pos51 at bottom-left (row5, column1), pos55 at bottom-right (row5, column5).

So pos23 is row2, column3.

Agent starts at pos15 (row1, column5). Needs to reach pos23 (row2, column3).

Possible path:

From pos15, move to pos25 (row2, column5) via dirright. Then from pos25, can move to pos24 (dirup), then to pos23 (dirup again?), but let's check the allowed moves.

Wait, the movement possibilities from pos25: "You may move from location pos25 to location pos15 following direction dirleft", "You may move from location pos25 to location pos35 following direction dirright", "You may move from location pos25 to location pos24 following direction dirup".

So after moving to pos25, the agent can go up to pos24. Then from pos24, possible moves are to pos14 (dirleft?), wait the allowed moves from pos24 are:

From the movement possibilities:

"You may move from location pos24 to location pos14 following direction dirleft"

"You may move from location pos24 to location pos34 following direction dirright"

"You may move from location pos24 to location pos23 following direction dirup"

"You may move from location pos24 to location pos25 following direction dirdown"

Wait, direction dirup from pos24 would be to pos23? Because pos24 is row2, column4. dirup would decrease the row number by 1? Or maybe directions are as per standard grid movement: dirup would be north (row decreases), dirdown south (row increases), dirleft west (column decreases), dirright east (column increases). So pos24 is row2, column4. dirup would go to row1, column4 (pos14). dirright would go to column5 (pos25 is row2, column5). Wait, no. The movement from pos24 to pos34 is via dirright. pos24 is column4, row2. dirright would increase column to 5, but pos25 is row2, column5. Wait, perhaps the movement directions are different. Let me check the movement possibilities as given.

For example, "You may move from location pos15 to location pos25 following direction dirright". pos15 is column5, row1. pos25 is column5, row2. So moving dirright from pos15 takes you down a row. Wait, that doesn't align with standard directions. So perhaps the directions are as follows:

- dirright: move down (row increases)

- dirleft: move up (row decreases)

- dirdown: move right (column increases)

- dirup: move left (column decreases)

No, that seems inconsistent. Alternatively, maybe the directions are based on the direction of movement. For example, moving dirright from pos15 to pos25 suggests that pos25 is to the right of pos15, but pos15 is at (1,5), so right would be column6, which is out of bounds. So perhaps the directions are different. Alternatively, perhaps the directions are based on the grid's edges. For example, moving dirright from pos11 (1,1) goes to pos21 (2,1), which would be south. Then, moving dirright from pos21 (2,1) goes to pos31 (3,1), which is further south. So in this case, dirright seems to correspond to moving down (row increases). Similarly, dirleft would be moving up (row decreases). Then, dirdown would be moving right (column increases), and dirup moving left (column decreases). Wait, that's possible. Let's check:

For example, from pos11 to pos21 via dirright: pos11 is (1,1), pos21 is (2,1). So dirright corresponds to moving down (row+1).

From pos11 to pos12 via dirdown: pos12 is (1,2). So dirdown increases the column by 1 (right).

Similarly, moving from pos12 to pos22 via dirright: pos12 is (1,2), pos22 is (2,2), so dirright is down.

From pos12 to pos13 via dirdown: pos13 is (1,3), so column increases by 1 (right).

So in this grid, directions are as follows:

- dirright: south (row increases)

- dirleft: north (row decreases)

- dirdown: east (column increases)

- dirup: west (column decreases)

Wait, no. Because from pos12 to pos13 is via dirdown. pos12 is (1,2), pos13 is (1,3), so column increases. So dirdown corresponds to east. dirright corresponds to south. dirup is west, dirleft is north. That makes sense.

So directions:

- dirdown: move east (column+1)

- dirup: move west (column-1)

- dirright: move south (row+1)

- dirleft: move north (row-1)

So for example, moving from pos15 (1,5) to pos25 (2,5) via dirright (south). Then from pos25 (2,5), dirup would be west (column-1) to pos24 (2,4). Then dirup again to pos23 (2,3). Then dirup to pos22 (2,2), etc.

Wait, but let's check the movement possibilities from pos25:

"You may move from location pos25 to location pos15 following direction dirleft" â€” dirleft is north (row-1). pos15 is (1,5). So moving north from pos25 (2,5) to pos15 (1,5) via dirleft.

"You may move from location pos25 to location pos35 following direction dirright" â€” south to row3, column5.

"You may move from location pos25 to location pos24 following direction dirup" â€” dirup is west, so column-1, so pos24 is (2,4).

Ah, so dirup from pos25 would be west to pos24 (2,4). Then from pos24, dirup again would take us to pos23 (2,3). Because pos24 is (2,4), dirup (west) would decrease column to 3: pos23 (2,3). Yes.

So the path from pos15 to pos23 could be:

pos15 -> pos25 (dirright) -> pos24 (dirup) -> pos23 (dirup). But wait, when moving from pos25 to pos24 via dirup, that's column 5 to 4. Then from pos24 to pos23 via dirup (column 4 to 3). But the stone is at pos23. So to push the stone, the agent needs to be adjacent to it in the direction they want to push.

Wait, to push the stone, the agent needs to be at a position adjacent to the stone, then push it in a direction. For example, if the stone is at pos23, and the agent is at pos24 (to the east of the stone), then the agent could push the stone west (dirup, which is west) into pos22. But pos22 is not a goal. Alternatively, if the agent is south of the stone, at pos33 (3,3), pushing north (dirleft) to pos23, but the stone is already there. Hmm, wait, no. The stone is at pos23. To push it, the agent must be in a position adjacent to the stone and then push in a direction that moves the stone to the next cell.

Wait, the "pushtogoal" and "pushtonongoal" actions require that the agent is at l_p, the stone is at l_from, and l_to is the next cell in direction d from l_from. Also, the agent can get from l_p to l_from following direction d, which means that l_p is adjacent to l_from in direction d. For example, if the stone is at l_from, and the agent is at l_p, which is adjacent to l_from in direction d, then pushing the stone from l_from to l_to (which is in the same direction d from l_from).

So to push the stone from pos23 to pos24 (east), the agent needs to be at pos22 (west of the stone) and push east (dirdown?), wait no. Let me clarify.

Wait, the direction in the action is the direction from l_p to l_from. So for example, if the agent is at pos22 (west of the stone at pos23), the direction from pos22 to pos23 is dirdown (east). Then, the stone is pushed from pos23 to pos24 (east), which would be direction dirdown again. So the action would be "pushtogoal" with direction dirdown.

Wait, this is getting a bit complicated. Let me think about the structure of the push actions.

The "pushtogoal" action is structured as:

pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d

Preconditions:

- agent p is at l_p.

- stone s is at l_from.

- l_to is clear.

- can get from l_p to l_from via direction d (so l_p is adjacent to l_from in direction d).

- can get from l_from to l_to via direction d (so l_to is adjacent to l_from in direction d).

- l_to is a goal location.

Similarly for pushtonongoal.

So, for example, if the agent is at pos24 (east of the stone at pos23), then direction from pos24 to pos23 is dirup (west). Then, pushing the stone from pos23 to pos22 (west) would be direction dirup. But pos22 is not a goal. The goal is pos55. So to get the stone to pos55, which is (5,5), the agent needs to push the stone east and south.

But the stone is at pos23 (2,3). To move it towards pos55, we need to move it east (column increases) and south (row increases).

So possible path for the stone: pos23 â†’ pos24 (east) â†’ pos34 (south) â†’ pos44 (south) â†’ pos45 (east?) Wait, pos44 to pos45 would be east (dirdown), but pos45 is (4,5). Then pos45 to pos55 via dirright (south). But pos55 is the goal.

But pushing the stone from pos23 to pos24 (east) requires the agent to be at pos23's west (pos22) or north (pos13) or south (pos33) or east (pos24). Wait, the agent needs to be adjacent to the stone in the direction from which they push.

Wait, to push the stone east (dirdown) from pos23 to pos24, the agent must be west of the stone (pos22) and push east. So direction dirdown (east) from pos22 to pos23, then from pos23 to pos24. So the action would be pushtonongoal (since pos24 is not a goal) player1 stone1 pos22 pos23 pos24 dirdown.

But first, the agent needs to get to pos22. How to get there from pos15.

The agent's path:

pos15 â†’ pos25 (dirright, south) â†’ pos24 (dirup, west) â†’ pos23 (dirup, west) but pos23 has the stone. Wait, no. The stone is at pos23. So agent can't move into pos23 unless it's clear. So after moving to pos24, the agent can't move to pos23 because the stone is there. Therefore, the agent needs to find another path.

Alternative path: pos15 â†’ pos14 (dirup, west) â†’ pos13 (dirup, west) â†’ pos23 (dirright, south). Let's check.

pos15 can move to pos14 via dirup (west?), wait no. The movement from pos15 is:

"You may move from location pos15 to location pos25 following direction dirright"

"You may move from location pos15 to location pos14 following direction dirup"

So dirup from pos15 leads to pos14. pos14 is (1,4). From pos14, the allowed moves are to pos24 (dirright, south), pos13 (dirup, west), or pos15 (dirdown, east). So to get to pos23, perhaps the agent can go from pos14 to pos24 (south), then to pos34 (south again?), but that's moving away. Alternatively, from pos14 to pos13 via dirup (west), then from pos13 to pos23 via dirright (south). Yes.

So path:

pos15 â†’ pos14 (dirup)

pos14 â†’ pos13 (dirup)

pos13 â†’ pos23 (dirright)

But pos23 has the stone. So agent can't move there. So this path is blocked.

Alternative approach: The agent needs to get to a position adjacent to the stone to push it. The stone is at pos23. The adjacent positions are pos22 (west), pos24 (east), pos13 (north), pos33 (south). The agent needs to reach one of these positions.

Let's try to get to pos22. How?

From pos15 â†’ pos25 (dirright) â†’ pos24 (dirup) â†’ pos23 is blocked. So from pos24, can the agent move north? pos24's allowed moves are dirleft (to pos14), dirright (to pos34), dirup (to pos23), dirdown (to pos25). So dirleft from pos24 is to pos14 (west?), no. Wait, the movement from pos24:

"You may move from location pos24 to location pos14 following direction dirleft" â€” dirleft is north. pos24 is (2,4). dirleft would be row-1, so pos14 (1,4). So to move from pos24 to pos14 via dirleft (north). Then from pos14, dirleft (north) to pos13 (1,3). Then from pos13, dirright (south) to pos23 (2,3). But again, pos23 is occupied by the stone.

Alternatively, from pos25, the agent can move to pos24 (dirup) â†’ pos14 (dirleft). No, that's not helpful.

Alternatively, the agent can go from pos15 to pos14 (dirup), then to pos13 (dirup), then to pos12 (dirup), then to pos22 (dirright). Let's see:

pos15 â†’ pos14 (dirup)

pos14 â†’ pos13 (dirup)

pos13 â†’ pos12 (dirup)

pos12 â†’ pos22 (dirright)

From pos22, the agent can push the stone east to pos23. Wait, but the stone is already at pos23. Wait, no. The stone is at pos23. So if the agent is at pos22 (west of pos23), they can push the stone east to pos24. Because pos23 is the current location of the stone, so pushing east (dirdown) from pos23 to pos24. But pos24 is clear (original state says pos24 is clear). So the agent can perform "pushtonongoal" to push the stone from pos23 to pos24.

Wait, but pos24 is not a goal. The goal is pos55. So this would be a step towards moving the stone east.

So after pushing to pos24, then the stone is at pos24, and the agent is at pos23 (since after pushing, the agent moves into the stone's previous position).

Then, the agent can move around to push the stone further east.

But let's plan this step by step.

First, the agent needs to reach pos22. How?

From pos15, the agent can move:

pos15 â†’ pos25 (dirright)

pos25 â†’ pos24 (dirup)

pos24 â†’ pos14 (dirleft)

pos14 â†’ pos13 (dirup)

pos13 â†’ pos12 (dirup)

pos12 â†’ pos22 (dirright)

But this seems long. Alternatively, maybe there's a shorter path.

Alternatively, from pos15, move to pos14 (dirup), then to pos13 (dirup), then to pos12 (dirup), then to pos22 (dirright).

Let's check the moves:

pos15 to pos14 via dirup (allowed).

pos14 to pos13 via dirup (allowed).

pos13 to pos12 via dirup (allowed).

pos12 to pos22 via dirright (south) â€” yes, according to movement possibilities: "You may move from location pos12 to location pos22 following direction dirright".

So that path is valid. So agent moves:

1. move player1 pos15 pos14 dirup

2. move player1 pos14 pos13 dirup

3. move player1 pos13 pos12 dirup

4. move player1 pos12 pos22 dirright

Now, agent is at pos22. From here, they can push the stone east to pos24 (since pos23 is the stone's location).

Wait, wait. The stone is at pos23. To push it east to pos24, the agent needs to be at pos22 (west of pos23), pushing east. So direction dirdown (east) from pos22 to pos23, then to pos24. So the action would be pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos23 pos24 dirdown. Because pos24 is not a goal.

But wait, pos24 is not a goal. So after pushing, the stone is at pos24, which is not a goal. Then, the agent needs to push it further towards pos55.

Next, from pos24, the agent can push the stone to pos34 (south), then to pos44, then pos45, then pos55.

But let's proceed step by step.

After the first push, the agent is at pos23 (since after pushing, the agent moves into the stone's previous location, pos23). The stone is at pos24.

Now, the agent needs to push the stone further. To push the stone from pos24 to pos34 (south), the agent needs to be north of pos24 (pos14) or west (pos23), east (pos25), or south (pos34). Let's see:

If the agent is at pos23, which is west of pos24, they can push east (dirdown) to pos25. But pos25 is not south. Alternatively, to push south, the agent needs to be north of pos24. So agent needs to get to pos14, then push south to pos24 â†’ pos34. But pos14 is north of pos24.

Alternatively, the agent can move from pos23 to pos24 (but pos24 has the stone now). Wait, after the first push, the stone is at pos24, so pos24 is not clear. So the agent is at pos23. To move to another position, they can go to pos22 (west), pos13 (north), or pos33 (south).

But to push the stone south to pos34, the agent needs to be north of pos24 (at pos14) and push south (dirright). But how to get there.

This is getting complicated. Maybe there's a better path.

Alternative approach: Push the stone south from pos23 to pos33, then east to pos34, pos44, pos45, pos55.

So to push south from pos23 to pos33, the agent needs to be north of pos23 (pos13) and push south (dirright). So agent needs to get to pos13.

But how to get to pos13 from pos22.

Wait, after the first push, the agent is at pos23. From there, they can move north to pos13 via dirleft (north). Then, from pos13, they can move east to pos14, then south to pos24, but that might not help. Alternatively, from pos13, they can push the stone south from pos23 to pos33.

Wait, the stone is at pos24 after the first push. So maybe that's a different scenario.

Let me try to outline the steps again:

1. Agent starts at pos15.

2. Agent moves to pos14 (dirup).

3. Agent moves to pos13 (dirup).

4. Agent moves to pos12 (dirup).

5. Agent moves to pos22 (dirright).

6. Agent pushes stone1 from pos23 to pos24 (dirdown).

Now, stone is at pos24, agent is at pos23.

7. Agent moves from pos23 to pos24 (dirright? But pos24 has the stone. So can't move there. So agent can't move east to pos24. So agent must move elsewhere.

From pos23, the agent can move north to pos13 (dirleft), west to pos22 (dirup), south to pos33 (dirright), or east to pos24 (dirdown) but it's blocked.

So agent can move to pos33 (south) from pos23 via dirright.

So step 7: move player1 pos23 pos33 dirright.

Now agent is at pos33. Then, they can push the stone from pos24 to pos34 (south). To do this, agent needs to be north of pos24 (pos14) or west (pos23), east (pos25), or south (pos34). But the agent is at pos33 (south of pos23). To reach a position to push the stone south from pos24 to pos34, the agent needs to be north of pos24 (pos14) and push south (dirright).

But getting to pos14 from pos33 would require a long path.

Alternatively, maybe the agent can circle around to the east side of the stone and push it south.

Wait, the stone is at pos24. To push it south to pos34, the agent needs to be north of pos24 (pos14) and push dirright (south). But how to get to pos14.

Alternatively, the agent can go from pos33 to pos34 (dirdown, east), then to pos44, etc., but that's moving away.

This seems complicated. Maybe there's a more efficient path.

Alternative plan: Push the stone south first.

If the agent can push the stone from pos23 south to pos33, then east to pos34, pos44, etc.

To push south from pos23 to pos33, the agent needs to be north of pos23 (pos13) and push dirright (south).

So agent needs to get to pos13.

From pos15, path to pos13:

pos15 â†’ pos14 (dirup) â†’ pos13 (dirup).

Then, from pos13, push the stone south to pos33.

So steps:

1. move player1 pos15 pos14 dirup

2. move player1 pos14 pos13 dirup

3. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos23 pos33 dirright

Now, the stone is at pos33 (non-goal). Agent is at pos23.

Then, push the stone east to pos34. To do that, agent needs to be west of pos33 (pos32) and push east (dirdown). But how to get to pos32 from pos23.

Agent is at pos23 after pushing. From pos23, they can move south to pos33 (dirright), but pos33 has the stone. So can't. Move west to pos22 (dirup), then south to pos32 (dirright), then east to pos33 (dirdown). But this seems complex.

Alternatively, after pushing to pos33, agent is at pos23. Then move to pos22 (dirup), then to pos32 (dirright), then to pos33 (dirdown) but stone is there.

Alternatively, agent can move from pos23 to pos24 (dirdown) if pos24 is clear. But after pushing to pos33, pos24 is clear? Wait, no. The stone was pushed to pos33, so pos23 is now clear (agent is there), pos33 is occupied by the stone. pos24 is still clear (unless something else is there).

Wait, after step 3, the stone is at pos33. So pos33 is not clear. pos23 has the agent. So pos24 is clear.

So agent can move from pos23 to pos24 (dirdown, east). Then from pos24, move to pos34 (dirright, south). Then from pos34, move to pos44 (dirright), etc. But the agent needs to push the stone.

Alternatively, after pushing to pos33, the agent is at pos23. Then, move to pos24 (dirdown). Then from pos24, move to pos34 (dirright). Then push the stone from pos33 to pos43 (south), but that's not helpful.

This is getting too complicated. Let me think again.

Alternative approach: Since the only goal is pos55, and the stone starts at pos23, the optimal path would be to push the stone east to pos24, then south to pos34, then south to pos44, then east to pos45, then south to pos55.

Each push requires the agent to be in the correct position.

Let's try:

1. Agent moves from pos15 to pos25 (dirright).

2. Agent moves from pos25 to pos24 (dirup).

3. Agent moves from pos24 to pos14 (dirleft).

4. Agent moves from pos14 to pos13 (dirup).

5. Agent moves from pos13 to pos12 (dirup).

6. Agent moves from pos12 to pos22 (dirright).

Now at pos22.

7. Push stone1 from pos23 to pos24 (dirdown) using pushtonongoal. Now stone is at pos24, agent at pos23.

8. Agent moves from pos23 to pos24 (dirdown) but pos24 has the stone. Can't. So instead, agent moves from pos23 to pos33 (dirright) south.

9. Agent is at pos33. Then moves to pos34 (dirdown east).

10. Agent moves to pos44 (dirright south).

11. Agent moves to pos45 (dirdown east).

12. Now agent is at pos45. To push the stone from pos24 to pos34, agent needs to be north of pos24 (pos14) but that's far. Alternatively, the stone is at pos24. To push it south to pos34, agent needs to be north of pos24 (pos14) and push south. But agent is at pos45.

This seems not working.

Alternative path after step 7:

Stone is at pos24. Agent is at pos23.

8. Agent moves from pos23 to pos22 (dirup west).

9. Agent moves from pos22 to pos32 (dirright south).

10. Agent moves from pos32 to pos33 (dirdown east).

11. Agent is at pos33, which is south of pos24. To push the stone south from pos24 to pos34, agent needs to be north of pos24 (pos14), but that's not possible. So perhaps the agent can't push south from here. So this approach isn't working.

Alternative idea: After pushing the stone to pos24, the agent can move around to the east side and push it further east.

After step 7, stone is at pos24. Agent is at pos23.

8. Agent moves from pos23 to pos24 (dirdown east) â€” but pos24 has the stone. Can't. So agent must move elsewhere.

Agent moves from pos23 to pos33 (dirright south).

9. Agent is at pos33. Then moves to pos34 (dirdown east).

10. Agent moves to pos44 (dirright south).

11. Agent moves to pos45 (dirdown east).

12. Agent moves to pos55 (dirright south) â€” but pos55 is a goal location. But the stone is still at pos24.

This isn't helpful.

Alternative approach: Maybe the agent should push the stone south first.

So starting at pos15, move to pos14, then pos13, then push the stone south to pos33.

Steps:

1. move player1 pos15 pos14 dirup

2. move player1 pos14 pos13 dirup

3. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos23 pos33 dirright

Now, stone is at pos33, agent at pos23.

4. Agent moves from pos23 to pos33 (dirright south) â€” but stone is there. Can't. So agent moves west to pos22 (dirup).

5. Agent moves from pos22 to pos32 (dirright south).

6. Agent moves from pos32 to pos33 (dirdown east) â€” stone is there. Can't.

So agent needs to get to the north of pos33 (pos23) to push it south to pos43.

But agent is at pos23, which is north of pos33. So:

7. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos33 pos43 dirright

Now stone is at pos43, agent at pos33.

8. Agent moves from pos33 to pos43 (dirright south) â€” can't, stone is there. So move east to pos44 (dirdown east).

9. Agent moves to pos44 (dirdown east).

10. Push stone from pos43 to pos53 (dirright south). But pos53 is not a goal.

This isn't getting closer to pos55.

This is getting too time-consuming. Let's try to find the optimal path.

The optimal plan would be the shortest path. Let's think about the minimal number of steps.

The stone needs to move from pos23 (2,3) to pos55 (5,5). The Manhattan distance is (5-2) + (5-3) = 3 + 2 = 5. Each push reduces the distance by 1 if moved towards the goal. But the path may require detours.

The agent needs to push the stone east three times (from column3 to 5) and south three times (from row2 to5). Total of 6 pushes. But each push requires the agent to position themselves correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps the agent can push the stone east to pos24, then south to pos34, east to pos44, south to pos54, east to pos55. That would require 4 pushes: east, south, east, south, east, but no. Wait, pos34 to pos44 is east, then south to pos54, then east to pos55. So three pushes east and two south, but need to reach pos55.

Wait, pos34 is (3,4). Pushing east to pos44 (4,4), then south to pos54 (5,4), then east to pos55 (5,5). So three pushes: east, south, east. So total of 3 pushes after the initial east push from pos23 to pos24.

But let's outline the steps:

1. Agent moves from pos15 to pos25 (dirright).

2. Agent moves from pos25 to pos24 (dirup).

3. Agent moves from pos24 to pos14 (dirleft).

4. Agent moves from pos14 to pos13 (dirup).

5. Agent moves from pos13 to pos12 (dirup).

6. Agent moves from pos12 to pos22 (dirright).

7. Push stone1 from pos23 to pos24 (dirdown) â†’ pushtonongoal.

Now stone is at pos24, agent at pos23.

8. Agent moves from pos23 to pos33 (dirright).

9. Agent moves from pos33 to pos34 (dirdown).

10. Agent moves from pos34 to pos44 (dirright).

11. Agent moves from pos44 to pos45 (dirdown).

12. Agent moves from pos45 to pos55 (dirright) â†’ but can't, pos55 is a goal, but agent needs to push the stone.

Alternatively, after step 7, the stone is at pos24. Agent is at pos23.

8. Agent moves from pos23 to pos24 (dirdown) â†’ can't, stone is there.

So agent moves west to pos22 (dirup).

9. Agent moves from pos22 to pos32 (dirright).

10. Agent moves from pos32 to pos33 (dirdown).

11. Agent moves from pos33 to pos34 (dirdown).

12. Agent moves from pos34 to pos44 (dirright).

13. Agent moves from pos44 to pos45 (dirdown).

14. Agent moves from pos45 to pos55 (dirright) â†’ but this is the goal, but the stone is at pos24.

This isn't helpful. So after step 7, stone is at pos24. Need to push it south to pos34.

To do that, agent needs to be north of pos24 (pos14) and push south. But agent is at pos23. So:

8. Agent moves from pos23 to pos13 (dirleft north).

9. Agent moves from pos13 to pos14 (dirdown east).

10. Agent moves from pos14 to pos24 (dirright south) â†’ pos24 has the stone. Can't move there.

So agent needs to push from pos14 to pos24.

Wait, the stone is at pos24. To push it south to pos34, the agent must be at pos24's north (pos14), and push south (dirright). So:

10. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos14 pos24 pos34 dirright.

But pos14 is clear (original state says pos14 is clear, and after previous steps, agent is at pos14 after step 9).

But wait, after step 7, the agent is at pos23. To get to pos14:

8. move player1 pos23 pos13 dirleft (north).

9. move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown (east).

Now, agent is at pos14. From here, they can push the stone from pos24 to pos34 (dirright south).

So step 10: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos14 pos24 pos34 dirright.

Now stone is at pos34 (goal? No, pos34 is not a goal. Only pos55 is a goal. So pushtonongoal.

Now agent is at pos24.

Then, to push the stone east to pos44:

11. Agent moves from pos24 to pos34 (dirright south) â†’ but pos34 has the stone. Can't.

So agent needs to go around. From pos24, move west to pos14 (dirleft north), then south to pos24 again. Not helpful.

Alternatively, after step 10, agent is at pos24. They can move east to pos25 (dirdown east), then south to pos35 (dirright south), then east to pos45 (dirdown east), then to pos55 (dirright south). But this is to reach pos55, but the stone is at pos34.

Then, from pos55, agent can push the stone up? No, the stone is at pos34. This approach isn't working.

This is taking too long. Given the time constraints, I'll propose a plan where the agent moves to pos22, pushes the stone east to pos24, then moves around to push it south to pos34, then east to pos44, south to pos54, and east to pos55. Each push requires careful positioning.

Here's the optimal plan:

```
move player1 pos15 pos25 dirright
move player1 pos25 pos24 dirup
move player1 pos24 pos14 dirleft
move player1 pos14 pos13 dirup
move player1 pos13 pos12 dirup
move player1 pos12 pos22 dirright
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos23 pos24 dirdown
move player1 pos23 pos13 dirleft
move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos14 pos24 pos34 dirright
move player1 pos24 pos34 dirright
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos34 pos44 dirdown
move player1 pos34 pos44 dirright
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos44 pos54 dirright
move player1 pos44 pos54 dirright
pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos54 pos54 pos55 dirdown
```

Wait, but this has several issues. For example, after pushing from pos24 to pos34, the agent is at pos24? No, after pushing, the agent moves into pos24. Then, the next move would be from pos24 to pos34, but pos34 has the stone. So that's invalid.

This is getting too complicated. Given the time, I'll provide a possible valid sequence, even if not optimal.

The optimal plan likely involves:

1. Agent moves from pos15 to pos25 (dirright)

2. Agent moves to pos24 (dirup)

3. Agent moves to pos14 (dirleft)

4. Agent moves to pos13 (dirup)

5. Agent moves to pos12 (dirup)

6. Agent moves to pos22 (dirright)

7. Push stone1 from pos23 to pos24 (dirdown)

8. Agent moves from pos23 to pos13 (dirleft)

9. Agent moves to pos14 (dirdown)

10. Push stone1 from pos24 to pos34 (dirright)

11. Agent moves from pos24 to pos34 (dirright)

12. Push stone1 from pos34 to pos44 (dirright)

13. Agent moves from pos34 to pos44 (dirright)

14. Push stone1 from pos44 to pos54 (dirright)

15. Agent moves from pos44 to pos54 (dirright)

16. Push stone1 from pos54 to pos55 (dirright)

But each push requires the agent to be in the correct position. For example, step 10: pushing from pos24 to pos34 requires agent to be at pos14, push dirright (south). Then agent ends up at pos24.

Then step 11: move from pos24 to pos34 (dirright), but pos34 now has the stone. Can't.

So after step 10, stone is at pos34, agent at pos24.

Then, to push to pos44, agent needs to be north of pos34 (pos24) and push south. So step 11: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos34 pos44 dirright.

This would move the stone to pos44, agent at pos34.

Then step 12: move agent from pos34 to pos44 (dirright).

Then step 13: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos44 pos54 dirright.

Stone at pos54, agent at pos44.

Finally, step 14: pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos54 pos55 dirdown (since pos55 is south of pos54).

Wait, to push from pos54 to pos55, the agent needs to be north of pos54 (pos44) and push south (dirright). So:

pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos54 pos55 dirright.

Thus, the full plan would be:

```
move player1 pos15 pos25 dirright
move player1 pos25 pos24 dirup
move player1 pos24 pos14 dirleft
move player1 pos14 pos13 dirup
move player1 pos13 pos12 dirup
move player1 pos12 pos22 dirright
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos23 pos24 dirdown
move player1 pos23 pos13 dirleft
move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos14 pos24 pos34 dirright
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos34 pos44 dirright
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos44 pos54 dirright
pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos44 pos54 pos55 dirright
```

But need to check each step's preconditions.

Step 1: move from pos15 to pos25 dirright: valid.

Step 2: move from pos25 to pos24 dirup: valid.

Step 3: move from pos24 to pos14 dirleft: valid.

Step4: pos14 to pos13 dirup: valid.

Step5: pos13 to pos12 dirup: valid.

Step6: pos12 to pos22 dirright: valid.

Step7: pushtonongoal from pos22 to pos23 to pos24 dirdown. Agent is at pos22, stone at pos23. pos24 is clear. pos24 is non-goal. Valid.

After this, stone at pos24, agent at pos23.

Step8: move from pos23 to pos13 dirleft. pos23 is now clear (agent left). pos13 is clear. Valid.

Step9: move from pos13 to pos14 dirdown (east). pos14 is clear. Valid.

Step10: pushtonongoal from pos14 to pos24 to pos34 dirright. Agent at pos14, stone at pos24. pos34 is clear. Valid. After pushing, agent at pos24, stone at pos34.

Step11: pushtonongoal from pos24 to pos34 to pos44 dirright. Agent at pos24, stone at pos34. pos44 must be clear. Valid. After pushing, agent at pos34, stone at pos44.

Step12: pushtonongoal from pos34 to pos44 to pos54 dirright. Agent at pos34, stone at pos44. pos54 must be clear. Valid. After pushing, agent at pos44, stone at pos54.

Step13: pushtogoal from pos44 to pos54 to pos55 dirright. pos55 is a goal. Agent at pos44, stone at pos54. pos55 must be clear. Valid. After pushing, agent at pos54, stone at pos55.

This results in the stone at pos55, which is the goal. So this plan has 13 steps. But perhaps there's a shorter way.

Alternative plan: After step7, the agent is at pos23. Instead of moving to pos13, can they go directly to pos24?

After step7: agent is at pos23, stone at pos24.

Step8: move from pos23 to pos33 dirright. pos33 is clear.

Step9: then move to pos34 dirdown (east).

Step10: then push stone from pos24 to pos34. But agent needs to be north of pos24 (pos14) to push south. So this approach doesn't work.

Thus, the initial plan seems necessary. However, the step count may be reduced.

Alternative path:

Instead of moving all the way to pos22, perhaps the agent can reach pos23 via a different route.

But given the time, I'll present the initial plan as a possible solution.
