Alright, let's understand the problem:

1. We have a 2D square grid (5x5, from pos11 to pos55).
2. One agent (player1), initially at pos41.
3. One stone (stone1), initially at pos33.
4. One goal location at pos13.
5. We need to get stone1 to a goal location.

Constraints:
1. The agent must be at pos23 at some point.
2. But before the agent can be at pos23, either stone1 must be at pos21 or pos52 must not be clear (i.e., either the agent or stone1 is at pos52).

Available Actions:
1. move player1 from_loc to_loc direction
2. pushtogoal player1 stone1 player_loc stone_loc goal_loc direction
3. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 player_loc stone_loc non_goal_loc direction

The main task is to move stone1 to a goal location (pos13). But we also need to satisfy the constraint that player1 is at pos23 at some point.

First, let's understand where everything is:
- player1 is at pos41
- stone1 is at pos33
- Goal location is at pos13

We need to move stone1 from pos33 to pos13. Let's visualize the grid:

```
  1 2 3 4 5
1 . . G . .  (G = goal)
2 . . . . .
3 . . S . .  (S = stone)
4 P . . . .  (P = player)
5 . . . . .
```

Now, let's think about the constraints:
- player1 must be at pos23 at some point.
- Before the agent can be at pos23, either stone1 must be at pos21 or pos52 must not be clear.

Regarding the second constraint, I don't see a reason why we would move stone1 to pos21, since our goal is to move it to pos13. So, let's consider the possibility of making pos52 not clear.

The player can move to pos52, making it not clear. So our plan could be:
1. Move stone1 from pos33 to pos13 (the goal).
2. Move player1 to pos52.
3. Move player1 to pos23.

To push stone1 from pos33 to pos13, player1 needs to be at the right position to push it in the right direction.

The desired final path for stone1 would be from pos33 to pos23 to pos13. This requires player1 to push stone1 up (from pos33 to pos23) and then left (from pos23 to pos13).

So, player1 needs to go from pos41 to pos34 to push stone1 up, and then to pos24 to push stone1 left.

Let's plan the steps:

1. player1 moves from pos41 to pos31.
2. player1 moves from pos31 to pos32.
3. player1 moves from pos32 to pos33 (but this is already occupied by stone1, so we can't do this).

Wait, I was thinking that the player needs to be at pos43 to push stone1 up. That's incorrect. The player needs to be below the stone to push it up. So, player1 needs to be at pos43 to push stone1 from pos33 to pos23.

Let's try again:

1. player1 moves from pos41 to pos42.
2. player1 moves from pos42 to pos43.
3. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos33 pos23 dirup (since stone1 is at pos33 and we want to push it up to pos23, the player needs to be at pos43).

Now, player1 is at pos33 (after the push) and stone1 is at pos23. 

But wait, pos23 is not a goal location, so I can't use pushtogoal. Instead, I need to use pushtonongoal since I'm pushing to a non-goal location.

Let's revise:

1. player1 moves from pos41 to pos42.
2. player1 moves from pos42 to pos43.
3. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos33 pos23 dirup.

Now, player1 is at pos33 and stone1 is at pos23. To push stone1 from pos23 to pos13 (the goal), player1 needs to be at pos24.

4. player1 moves from pos33 to pos34.
5. player1 moves from pos34 to pos24.
6. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos23 pos13 dirleft.

Now, stone1 is at the goal location pos13. The primary task is complete. But we still have the constraints to satisfy.

7. player1 moves from pos23 to pos24.
8. player1 moves from pos24 to pos34.
9. player1 moves from pos34 to pos44.
10. player1 moves from pos44 to pos54.
11. player1 moves from pos54 to pos53.
12. player1 moves from pos53 to pos52. (Now, pos52 is not clear.)
13. player1 moves from pos52 to pos42.
14. player1 moves from pos42 to pos32.
15. player1 moves from pos32 to pos33.
16. player1 moves from pos33 to pos23. (Now, player1 is at pos23, satisfying the second constraint.)

Wait, there's an issue with the constraints. It says:

"If expression 'player1 is at location pos23' holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which ... either 'stone1 is at location pos21' or 'Location pos52 is not clear'."

But in our plan, player1 is at pos23 in step 6 (after pushing stone1 to pos13), and we haven't yet satisfied the condition about stone1 at pos21 or pos52 not being clear.

Let's revise our plan.

Actually, I misunderstood the problem initially. The player (player1) is at pos41 and the stone (stone1) is at pos33. I had earlier incorrectly stated that Location pos33 and pos41 are clear, but they are not, as they contain the stone and player respectively. Let me re-read and be more careful.

Looking at the initial state again, it says "Location pos33 is clear" and "Location pos41 is clear". But it also says "player1 is at location pos41" and "stone1 is at location pos33". I think this might be an inconsistency in the problem statement.

I'm going to assume that player1 is at pos41 and stone1 is at pos33, and that those locations are NOT clear (i.e., the statements "Location pos33 is clear" and "Location pos41 is clear" at the end of the initial state description are incorrect).

With that understanding, let's re-plan.

First, let's think about the constraints:
1. player1 must be at pos23 at some point.
2. Before player1 can be at pos23, either stone1 must be at pos21 or pos52 must not be clear.

Hmm, actually, the constraint doesn't completely prohibit player1 from being at pos23 initially. It just specifies a condition that must be true before player1 can be at pos23. If that condition is true from the beginning, then player1 can be at pos23 without any additional steps.

I'm not sure this is the case, but let's try to accommodate it in our plan anyways. We'll try to make sure that either stone1 is at pos21 or pos52 is not clear before player1 goes to pos23.

Given the layout, it seems easier to have player1 go to pos52 than to move stone1 to pos21.

Let's revise our plan:

1. player1 moves from pos41 to pos42.
2. player1 moves from pos42 to pos52. (Now, pos52 is not clear.)
3. player1 moves from pos52 to pos42.
4. player1 moves from pos42 to pos32.
5. player1 moves from pos32 to pos33. (Now, player1 is at the position of stone1, which is not possible.)

Actually, we can't move to pos33 if stone1 is already there. So, we need to adjust the plan.

Actually, there's an important thing to consider. The problem asks for an "optimal" plan, which means the shortest valid plan. If we detour to pos52 to satisfy the constraint, it might make the plan longer than necessary.

Let's think about the optimal way to move stone1 from pos33 to pos13 while ensuring player1 is at pos23 at some point, and before that, either stone1 is at pos21 or pos52 is not clear.

Actually, one option is to push stone1 from pos33 to pos23, then to pos13. But that would put player1 at pos23 without having satisfied the condition about stone1 at pos21 or pos52 not being clear. So, this direct route might not satisfy the constraints.

Another option is to push stone1 from pos33 to pos32, then to pos31, then to pos21, and then to pos11, and finally to pos12 and pos13. This route would satisfy the constraint about stone1 being at pos21, but it seems like a long detour.

The third option is to have player1 go to pos52 before moving stone1, satisfying the condition that pos52 is not clear.

Let's explore the second and third options to see which is shorter.

Option 2 (pushing stone1 through pos21):
1. player1 moves from pos41 to pos42.
2. player1 moves from pos42 to pos32.
3. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos33 pos32 dirleft.
4. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos32 pos31 dirleft.
5. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos31 pos21 dirup.
6. player1 moves from pos31 to pos32.
7. player1 moves from pos32 to pos22.
8. player1 moves from pos22 to pos23. (player1 is at pos23, and the condition that stone1 is at pos21 is satisfied.)
9. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos21 pos11 dirleft.
10. player1 moves from pos21 to pos22.
11. player1 moves from pos22 to pos12.
12. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos12 pos11 pos12 dirdown.
13. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos11 pos12 pos13 dirdown.

That's 13 steps.

Option 3 (player1 goes to pos52 first):
1. player1 moves from pos41 to pos42.
2. player1 moves from pos42 to pos52. (pos52 is not clear.)
3. player1 moves from pos52 to pos42.
4. player1 moves from pos42 to pos32.
5. player1 moves from pos32 to pos22.
6. player1 moves from pos22 to pos23. (player1 is at pos23, and the condition that pos52 is not clear has been satisfied.)
7. player1 moves from pos23 to pos33.
8. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos33 pos23 dirup.
9. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos23 pos13 dirleft.

That's 9 steps.

Option 3 seems shorter, so let's go with that.

Actually, I think there's a mistake in step 7 of Option 3. If player1 is at pos23, then player1 can't move to pos33 if stone1 is still at pos33. So, we need a different approach.

Let's reconsider Option 3:

1. player1 moves from pos41 to pos42.
2. player1 moves from pos42 to pos52. (pos52 is not clear.)
3. player1 moves from pos52 to pos42.
4. player1 moves from pos42 to pos32.
5. player1 moves from pos32 to pos22.
6. player1 moves from pos22 to pos23. (player1 is at pos23, and the condition that pos52 is not clear has been satisfied.)
7. player1 moves from pos23 to pos24.
8. player1 moves from pos24 to pos34.
9. player1 moves from pos34 to pos43. (player1 is now below stone1.)
10. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos33 pos23 dirup.
11. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos23 pos13 dirleft.

That's 11 steps, which is still shorter than Option 2.

Actually, I'm confused again. In step 9 of Option 3, I say that player1 is now below stone1, but I meant that player1 is now at a location where they can push stone1. But pos43 is to the right of pos33, not below it. So, I can't push stone1 up using dirup from that position. I can push it to the right using dirright, but that's not what we want.

I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let's try to simplify. 

The player starts at pos41, and the stone is at pos33. We want to move the stone to pos13 (the goal). Before player1 can be at pos23, either stone1 must be at pos21 or pos52 must not be clear.

Since the shortest solution would be to get player1 to a position where it can push stone1 towards the goal, let's think logically.

Stone1 is at pos33, and we want to move it to pos13 (the goal). The direct path would be pos33 -> pos23 -> pos13. This requires player1 to first push stone1 from pos33 to pos23 (by being at pos43) and then push it from pos23 to pos13 (by being at pos33).

But there's the constraint that before player1 can be at pos23, either stone1 must be at pos21 or pos52 must not be clear. We don't want to move stone1 to pos21 since it's out of the way. So, our best bet seems to be to make pos52 not clear first, which means player1 should go to pos52.

Let's visualize the grid again to help us (apologies for the inconsistency with the understanding of the problem earlier):

```
  1 2 3 4 5
1 . . G . .  (G = goal at pos13)
2 . . . . .
3 . . S . .  (S = stone at pos33)
4 P . . . .  (P = player at pos41)
5 . . . . .
```

Let's try a direct plan:

1. player1 moves from pos41 to pos31. (Player now at pos31.)
2. player1 moves from pos31 to pos32. (Player now at pos32.)
3. player1 moves from pos32 to pos42. (Player now at pos42.)
4. player1 moves from pos42 to pos52. (Player now at pos52, making pos52 not clear.)
5. player1 moves from pos52 to pos42. (Player now at pos42.)
6. player1 moves from pos42 to pos43. (Player now at pos43.)
7. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos33 pos23 dirup. (Player now at pos33, stone at pos23.)
8. player1 moves from pos33 to pos23. (Player now at pos23, satisfying the constraint. The condition stone1 at pos21 or pos52 not clear was satisfied earlier by the player going to pos52.)
9. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos23 pos13 dirleft. (Player now at pos23, stone at pos13.)

Wait this doesn't quite work, because in step 8, player1 can't move to pos23 if stone1 is at pos23. And in step 9, player1 can't push stone1 from pos23 if the player is also at pos23.

Let's rethink.

Actually, the player should push the stone from pos33 to pos23, making the player end up at pos33 and the stone at pos23. Then, the player should move from pos33 to pos24, and from there, push the stone from pos23 to pos13.

So, our corrected plan would be:

1. player1 moves from pos41 to pos31. (Player now at pos31.)
2. player1 moves from pos31 to pos32. (Player now at pos32.)
3. player1 moves from pos32 to pos42. (Player now at pos42.)
4. player1 moves from pos42 to pos52. (Player now at pos52, making pos52 not clear.)
5. player1 moves from pos52 to pos42. (Player now at pos42.)
6. player1 moves from pos42 to pos43. (Player now at pos43.)
7. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos33 pos23 dirup. (Player now at pos33, stone at pos23.)
8. player1 moves from pos33 to pos34. (Player now at pos34.)
9. player1 moves from pos34 to pos24. (Player now at pos24.)
10. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos23 pos13 dirleft. (Player now at pos23, stone at pos13.)

This gives us 10 steps, which is better than the 11 steps in Option 3 above. This plan also ensures that pos52 is not clear before player1 goes to pos23, satisfying the constraint.

So it seems like the optimal plan is:

1. player1 moves from pos41 to pos31.
2. player1 moves from pos31 to pos32.
3. player1 moves from pos32 to pos42.
4. player1 moves from pos42 to pos52. (pos52 is not clear, satisfying the condition for the player to be at pos23 later.)
5. player1 moves from pos52 to pos42.
6. player1 moves from pos42 to pos43.
7. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos33 pos23 dirup. (Stone is now at pos23, player is at pos33.)
8. player1 moves from pos33 to pos34.
9. player1 moves from pos34 to pos24.
10. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos23 pos13 dirleft. (Stone is now at the goal, pos13, and the player is at pos23.)

Actually, I think I can optimize further. Instead of going from pos41 to pos31 and then to pos32, the player can go directly from pos41 to pos42 (moving down). This saves a step.

1. player1 moves from pos41 to pos42.
2. player1 moves from pos42 to pos52. (pos52 is not clear, satisfying the condition for the player to be at pos23 later.)
3. player1 moves from pos52 to pos42.
4. player1 moves from pos42 to pos43.
5. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos33 pos23 dirup. (Stone is now at pos23, player is at pos33.)
6. player1 moves from pos33 to pos34.
7. player1 moves from pos34 to pos24.
8. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos23 pos13 dirleft. (Stone is now at the goal, pos13, and the player is at pos23.)

This gives us 8 steps, which is even better.

But I'm still not sure if I'm understanding the constraints correctly.

The constraint says: "If expression 'player1 is at location pos23' holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which ... either 'stone1 is at location pos21' or 'Location pos52 is not clear'."

Does this mean we need to ensure that one of these conditions is satisfied before player1 is at pos23? Or does it mean that if player1 is at pos23, then one of these conditions must have been true at some point in the past, even if it's not true currently?

I think it's the latter. So, if player1 is ever at pos23, then at some point prior, either stone1 was at pos21 or pos52 was not clear.

In our plan, we ensure that pos52 is not clear (by having player1 move to pos52) before player1 is at pos23. So, this satisfies the constraint.

One issue I just realized: When we push stone1 from pos23 to pos13, the player ends up at pos23. But in our plan, before the player can be at pos23, pos52 should not be clear. And our plan ensures that pos52 is not clear by having the player go to pos52. But after the player leaves pos52, it becomes clear again. So, we're not satisfying the constraint if the condition is that pos52 should be not clear exactly when the player is at pos23.

I'm going to assume that the constraint means that if the player is ever at pos23, then at some point earlier, either stone1 was at pos21 or pos52 was not clear, even if those conditions don't all hold simultaneously. Under this interpretation, our plan is valid.

But to be safe, let's consider the alternative: that when the player is at pos23, one of those conditions must be simultaneously true. In this case, we'd need to either keep pos52 not clear or make stone1 be at pos21 while the player is at pos23.

Let's consider making pos52 not clear when the player is at pos23. One way to do this would be to have another stone at pos52. But since we only have stone1, we'd need to move stone1 to pos52. But we want stone1 to eventually be at the goal (pos13). So, this seems like an extra detour.

The other option is to move stone1 to pos21 before the player is at pos23. Let's think about this:

1. player1 moves from pos41 to pos42.
2. player1 moves from pos42 to pos32.
3. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos33 pos32 dirleft.
4. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos32 pos31 dirleft.
5. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos31 pos21 dirup.
6. player1 moves from pos31 to pos32.
7. player1 moves from pos32 to pos22.
8. player1 moves from pos22 to pos12.
9. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos12 pos21 pos22 dirdown.
10. player1 moves from pos21 to pos22.
11. player1 moves from pos22 to pos23. (player1 is at pos23, and simultaneously, stone1 is at pos22, not at pos21.)

But this doesn't work because stone1 is at pos22, not pos21, when player1 is at pos23. So, this approach doesn't satisfy the simultaneous condition interpretation of the constraint.

I'm going back to the interpretation that if player1 is ever at pos23, then at some point earlier, either stone1 was at pos21 or pos52 was not clear, even if those conditions don't all hold simultaneously. With this interpretation, our 8-step plan is valid.

More importantly, however, let's test our final 8-step plan to make sure it's physically possible.
Final plan:
1. player1 moves from pos41 to pos42.
2. player1 moves from pos42 to pos52. (pos52 is not clear, satisfying the condition for the player to be at pos23 later.)
3. player1 moves from pos52 to pos42.
4. player1 moves from pos42 to pos43.
5. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos33 pos23 dirup. (Stone is now at pos23, player is at pos33.)
6. player1 moves from pos33 to pos34.
7. player1 moves from pos34 to pos24.
8. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos23 pos13 dirleft. (Stone is now at the goal, pos13, and the player is at pos23.)

Hm, I'm actually not sure if player1 can move from pos42 to pos43 in step 4. Let me check the initial state information. Actually, I can verify because the problem says "You may move from location pos42 to location pos43 following direction dirdown."

So this is the final answer.

Actually I realize I made a mistake. The player1 is at pos41. 

move player1 pos41 pos42 dirdown
move player1 pos42 pos52 dirright
move player1 pos52 pos42 dirleft
move player1 pos42 pos43 dirdown
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos33 pos23 dirup
move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown
move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft
pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos23 pos13 dirleft

Wait, I think there's another mistake. If pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos33 pos23 dirup means that player1 pushes stone1 from pos33 to pos23, then the direction should be dirleft, not dirup. 

Actually, I think I misunderstood what 'direction' means in this context. Based on the actions, the direction should specify the direction of the push/move, not the relative position of the locations.

In our case, moving from pos33 to pos23 would be moving left, so the direction would be dirleft. Moving from pos41 to pos42 would be moving down, so the direction would be dirdown.

Let me redo the plan:

1. move player1 pos41 pos42 dirdown
2. move player1 pos42 pos52 dirright
3. move player1 pos52 pos42 dirleft
4. move player1 pos42 pos43 dirdown
5. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos33 pos23 dirleft
6. move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown
7. move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft
8. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos23 pos13 dirleft

Actually, let's think about the directions more carefully.

1. move from pos41 to pos42: pos42 is below pos41, so direction is dirdown.
2. move from pos42 to pos52: pos52 is to the right of pos42, so direction is dirright.
3. move from pos52 to pos42: pos42 is to the left of pos52, so direction is dirleft.
4. move from pos42 to pos43: pos43 is to the right of pos42, so direction is dirright. (Not dirdown!)
5. push stone1 from pos33 to pos23: pos23 is to the left of pos33, so direction is dirleft.
6. move from pos33 to pos34: pos34 is to the right of pos33, so direction is dirright. (Not dirdown!)
7. move from pos34 to pos24: pos24 is above pos34, so direction is dirup. (Not dirleft!)
8. push stone1 from pos23 to pos13: pos13 is above pos23, so direction is dirup. (Not dirleft!)

So, the corrected directions would be:

1. move player1 pos41 pos42 dirdown
2. move player1 pos42 pos52 dirright
3. move player1 pos52 pos42 dirleft
4. move player1 pos42 pos43 dirright
5. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos33 pos23 dirleft
6. move player1 pos33 pos34 dirright
7. move player1 pos34 pos24 dirup
8. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos23 pos13 dirup

Let me just double-check the grid positions to make sure I'm not making any errors:

```
  1 2 3 4 5
1 . . G . .  (G = goal at pos13)
2 . . . . .
3 . . S . .  (S = stone at pos33)
4 P . . . .  (P = player at pos41)
5 . . . . .
```

Move 1: Player from (4,1) to (4,2), direction is down. Looking at the image, pos42 is down from pos41, so this is correct.

Move 2: Player from (4,2) to (5,2), direction is right. Pos52 is to the right of pos42, so correct.

Move 3: Player from (5,2) to (4,2), direction is left. Pos42 is to the left of pos52, so correct.

Move 4: Player from (4,2) to (4,3), direction is right. Pos43 is to the right of pos42, so correct.

Move 5: Player pushes stone from (3,3) to (2,3), direction is left. Pos23 is to the left of pos33, so correct.

Move 6: Player from (3,3) to (3,4), direction is right. Pos34 is to the right of pos33, so correct.

Move 7: Player from (3,4) to (2,4), direction is up. Pos24 is above pos34, so correct.

Move 8: Player pushes stone from (2,3) to (1,3), direction is up. Pos13 is above pos23, so correct.

I think the corrections I made were right. Let's take a step back.

After step 2 (move player1 pos42 pos52 dirright), pos52 has player1, so pos52 is not clear. This is one of the conditions that must be true before player1 can be at pos23.

After step 8 (pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos23 pos13 dirup), stone1 is at the goal location (pos13), and player1 is at pos23. This fulfills the main task of moving stone1 to a goal location, and also the constraint that player1 must be at pos23 at some point. This approach is also efficient, only taking 8 steps.

So, our optimal plan is:

1. move player1 pos41 pos42 dirdown
2. move player1 pos42 pos52 dirright
3. move player1 pos52 pos42 dirleft
4. move player1 pos42 pos43 dirright
5. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos33 pos23 dirleft
6. move player1 pos33 pos34 dirright
7. move player1 pos34 pos24 dirup
8. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos23 pos13 dirup
