Okay, let's see. I need to find a plan that moves stone1 to a goal location, which in this case is pos13. The initial state has stone1 at pos33, and the agent (player1) starts at pos41. The constraints are that the agent must be at pos23 at some point, and if that happens, then in an earlier state either stone1 is at pos21 or pos52 is not clear.

First, the goal is to get stone1 to a goal location. The only goal location mentioned is pos13. So the main task is to move stone1 from pos33 to pos13. 

But there's a constraint: the agent has to be at pos23 in some state. And when that happens, either stone1 was at pos21 before or pos52 was blocked earlier. So I need to make sure that when the agent is at pos23, one of those two conditions was true previously.

Let me start by figuring out the path to move the stone. Stone1 is at pos33. To push it towards pos13, the agent needs to get behind the stone relative to the direction of movement. Since pos13 is to the west (left) of pos33, the agent would need to be to the east (right) of the stone to push it west. But in grid terms, positions like pos33 to pos23 to pos13. So the agent needs to move around to push the stone from the east side each time.

Wait, the movement directions: let me check the allowed moves. For example, from pos33, moving left (dirleft) would go to pos23. So if the agent is at pos43 (south of pos33), they could move up to pos33, but if the stone is there, they can't. Wait, the stone is at pos33 initially, but the initial state says "Location pos33 is clear". Wait, no: in the original state, "stone1 is at location pos33" and "Location pos33 is clear"? Wait, that's conflicting. Wait, no—the "clear" probably means there's nothing else there. Wait, the original state lists "stone1 is at location pos33" and "Location pos33 is clear". That seems contradictory. Wait, maybe "clear" refers to the absence of the agent. Because the agent and stones are separate. So a location is clear if neither the agent nor a stone is there. Wait, but the original state says "Location pos33 is clear" but also "stone1 is at pos33". That must be a mistake. Wait, no, let's check the original state again.

Looking back: The original state includes "stone1 is at location pos33" and "Location pos33 is clear". Hmm, that's conflicting. Unless "clear" refers only to the agent's presence. Wait, maybe in this domain, a location can have a stone and be considered "clear" for the agent. But the preconditions for move actions require that the target location is clear. So maybe "clear" means that the agent is not present there, but stones can be present. Wait, but when moving, the agent can't move into a location that has a stone because the stone is blocking. So perhaps "clear" means the location has neither the agent nor a stone. But that would conflict with the original state here, where pos33 has stone1 but is marked as clear. So maybe there's a misunderstanding in the problem setup.

Wait, the original state says:

"stone1 is at location pos33"

"Location pos33 is clear"

But how can a location have a stone and be clear? That must be an error. Or perhaps "clear" refers to the agent not being there. So a location is clear if the agent isn't there, regardless of stones. But then when moving, the agent can move to a location with a stone? That doesn't make sense. So perhaps "clear" means that there is neither an agent nor a stone in the location. Therefore, the original state is inconsistent. But according to the problem statement, the initial state is as given, so maybe there's a mistake here. Alternatively, maybe "Location pos33 is clear" is a typo and should be something else. But the user provided this, so we have to work with it.

Wait, let's check the original state again. The user provided:

Original state:

- player1 is at pos41.

- stone1 is at pos33.

- Various locations are clear. For pos33, it's stated as "Location pos33 is clear". But stone1 is there. So this must be an inconsistency. Unless "clear" here means something else, like the agent isn't present. So stones can be in a location that's considered "clear" in terms of the agent's presence. But then, when moving, the agent can't move into a location that's not clear (i.e., has the agent or a stone). But in the initial state, pos33 has a stone but is clear. That would mean that "clear" is only about the agent's presence. Therefore, a location with a stone is considered clear for the agent's movement? That can't be right. Because moving into a stone's position would require pushing, but the move action is only for moving the agent when the target is clear. So perhaps "clear" means the agent is not present. So a location with a stone is not clear. Wait, but then in the initial state, pos33 has a stone, so it's not clear. But the problem says "Location pos33 is clear". So there's a contradiction here. That must be a mistake in the problem setup. But since I have to proceed with the given information, perhaps I should assume that in the initial state, pos33 is not clear because of the stone, but the problem says it's clear. This is confusing.

Wait, the problem's initial state says:

"stone1 is at location pos33"

Then, under "Location pos33 is clear". So maybe the initial state is incorrect. But maybe the "clear" is a separate property. Wait, no. The problem probably defines that a location is clear if there's no agent or stone present. Therefore, if a stone is present, the location is not clear. Therefore, the initial state's assertion that pos33 is clear is a contradiction. But perhaps the problem intended that pos33 is occupied by the stone, hence not clear, but in the given initial state, it's stated as clear. That's a problem. However, since the user provided this, perhaps it's a typo, and the actual initial state is that pos33 has the stone and is not clear. But given that the problem says "Location pos33 is clear", I have to work with that. Therefore, the initial state has stone1 at pos33, but the location is considered clear. That implies that stones do not block the clearness. Therefore, "clear" only refers to the agent's presence. So when moving, the agent can't go into a location that already has the agent (i.e., is not clear), but stones don't affect that. But then, when pushing, the stone's presence would block movement. Hmm, this is unclear, but I have to proceed with the given problem.

Alternatively, maybe the "clear" in the initial state refers to the agent not being present, and stones are separate. So even if a stone is present, the location is considered clear if the agent isn't there. That would make sense. So for the move action, the preconditions require that the target location is clear (agent not present), regardless of stones. But pushing actions would require that the stone is in a location and the agent can push it. So in that case, the initial state has stone1 at pos33, and pos33 is clear (agent not there), so that's acceptable. So when moving, the agent can't move into pos33 because it's occupied by a stone? Or is the stone considered separate, and the agent can move into pos33 if it's clear (agent not there)? The move action's preconditions are: (i) agent is at l_from, (ii) l_to is clear, (iii) can move from l_from to l_to following direction d. So if l_to is clear (agent not there), even if there's a stone, then the agent can move there. But that would mean the agent can be in the same location as a stone, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, perhaps the correct interpretation is that a location is clear if there's no agent or stone. Therefore, in the initial state, pos33 has a stone, so it's not clear, but the problem says it's clear. That's conflicting. Therefore, this is a problem. Maybe the problem intended that pos33 is not clear, but the user made a mistake. Alternatively, the "clear" in the initial state is only about the agent's presence, and stones are allowed. So pos33 has a stone but is clear (agent not present). Therefore, the agent can move into pos33 if possible, but since there's a stone there, that's not allowed. Wait, but the move action requires that l_to is clear. If l_to is pos33, and it's clear (agent not present), but has a stone, then is the move allowed? According to the problem's action preconditions: "move p l_from l_to d": (ii) l_to is clear. So if a stone is present, is l_to considered not clear? The problem's initial state says "Location pos33 is clear" even though stone1 is there, which implies that stones don't affect the clearness. So clearness is only about the agent's presence. Therefore, the move action's precondition (ii) is that the target location does not have the agent. Therefore, even if a stone is present, the agent can move there as long as the agent isn't there. Wait, but that would allow the agent and stone to be in the same location, which is impossible. So this must be a mistake. Therefore, perhaps the problem has an error in the initial state. However, since I have to proceed, perhaps I should assume that the initial state is correct as given, even if contradictory. Therefore, the agent is at pos41, stone1 is at pos33, and pos33 is clear (agent not there). So the stone is at pos33, but the location is considered clear for movement. So the agent can move into pos33 if possible. But how can the agent and stone coexist in the same location? That seems impossible. Therefore, perhaps the move action is only allowed if the target location has no agent or stone. Therefore, the initial state's assertion that pos33 is clear is incorrect, but we have to proceed with the given data. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem's definition of "clear" is that the location is empty (no agent or stone). Therefore, in the initial state, pos33 is not clear (because stone1 is there), but the problem says it is. That's conflicting. So perhaps this is a mistake in the problem setup, but the user provided it, so I need to proceed as if it's correct. Therefore, despite the stone being present, pos33 is considered clear. So the agent can move into pos33. But that would result in the agent and stone being in the same location, which might be allowed in this domain. However, when the agent is there, the location becomes not clear. But this is getting too confusing. Let's try to proceed.

The main goal is to move stone1 to a goal location (pos13). The agent starts at pos41. So the agent needs to navigate to pos33, push the stone west to pos23, then to pos13 (the goal). But to push the stone, the agent needs to be adjacent in the direction opposite to the push. For example, to push the stone west from pos33 to pos23, the agent needs to be east of the stone (pos43?), wait, no. The direction depends on the allowed movement. Let's check the allowed movement directions.

Looking at the movement from pos33:

"You may move from location pos33 to location pos23 following direction dirleft"

"You may move from location pos33 to location pos43 following direction dirright"

"You may move from location pos33 to location pos32 following direction dirup"

"You may move from location pos33 to location pos34 following direction dirdown"

So pos33's adjacent cells are pos23 (left), pos43 (right), pos32 (up), pos34 (down).

To push the stone west (dirleft) from pos33 to pos23, the agent needs to be at pos33 and push it west. Wait, no. The push actions require that the agent is at l_p, which is adjacent to l_from (where the stone is), in the direction d. For example, to push the stone from l_from to l_to, the agent must be at l_p, which is adjacent to l_from in direction d. Wait, the preconditions of pushtogoal/pushtonongoal:

"pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": preconditions include (iv) you can get from l_p to l_from following d. So l_p must be adjacent to l_from in direction d, and the direction from l_from to l_to must also be d. So for example, if the stone is at l_from (pos33), and the agent is at l_p (pos43), which is to the right (dirright) of pos33, then the agent can push the stone to l_to (pos23) if that's possible. Wait, but direction for moving from l_p to l_from would be dirleft (from pos43 to pos33 is left). Wait, no. Let me think: if the agent is at pos43 (east of pos33), then to get to pos33, the direction would be dirleft (since moving from pos43 to pos33 is left). So if the agent is at pos43, and the stone is at pos33, then the agent can push the stone west (dirleft) from pos33 to pos23. So the direction d would be dirleft. But then the preconditions for pushtogoal would require that you can move from l_p (pos43) to l_from (pos33) following direction d (dirleft). Let's check the allowed moves.

Looking at pos43's allowed moves:

"You may move from location pos43 to location pos33 following direction dirleft"

Yes. So the direction from pos43 to pos33 is dirleft. So the agent at pos43 can push the stone from pos33 to pos23 (dirleft direction). Then, the stone moves to pos23, and the agent moves to pos33. Then, the agent can push the stone again from pos23 to pos13, provided the agent is at pos33 (but after pushing, the agent is at pos33). Wait, no. After pushing, the agent moves to l_from (pos33) in this case. Wait, no, let's look at the effects of pushtogoal:

After pushtogoal, agent p is at location l_from (pos33), and the stone is at l_to (pos23). So after pushing from pos33 to pos23, the agent is now at pos33. Then, to push the stone from pos23 to pos13, the agent needs to be adjacent to pos23 in the direction of the push (dirleft again). So the agent would need to be at pos33 (which they are after the first push), and push the stone from pos23 to pos13 (dirleft). But the direction from the agent's current position (pos33) to pos23 is dirleft. Wait, no: pos33 is east of pos23. So moving from pos33 to pos23 is dirleft. So the agent at pos33 can push the stone at pos23 to pos13 (dirleft). So that's possible.

So the steps would be:

1. Move agent from pos41 to pos43 (to get behind the stone to push it west).

2. Push the stone from pos33 to pos23 (using pushtonongoal because pos23 is not a goal location yet).

3. Then, push the stone from pos23 to pos13 (using pushtogoal since pos13 is a goal).

But wait, the first push would be to a non-goal location (pos23), so use pushtonongoal. Then the second push to pos13 (goal) with pushtogoal.

But the problem's constraints require that the agent must be at pos23 at some point. Also, if the agent is at pos23, then in an earlier state, either stone1 was at pos21 or pos52 was not clear.

So how to get the agent to pos23? Let's see.

If the agent pushes the stone from pos33 to pos23, then after that, the agent is at pos33. Then, to get to pos23, they need to move from pos33 to pos23 via dirleft. But can they do that? Let's check the movement possibilities. From pos33, can they move to pos23? Yes, direction dirleft. But after the push, the stone is at pos23. So pos23 is occupied by the stone. So the agent can't move there unless it's clear. But after the push, the stone is at pos23, so pos23 is not clear. Therefore, the agent can't move into pos23 directly. Therefore, they need to find another way to reach pos23.

Alternatively, maybe after pushing the stone to pos23, the agent is at pos33, and then they can move around to reach pos23 via a different path.

Wait, but the stone is at pos23, so pos23 is not clear. So the agent can't move into pos23 unless pushing the stone again. So how can the agent reach pos23? They have to either push the stone out of pos23 or have another way.

Alternatively, maybe during the process of moving to push the stone to pos13, the agent could pass through pos23. But given that the stone is at pos23, which is not a goal, and the agent needs to push it to pos13, perhaps the agent needs to get to pos23's east (pos33) to push it west. So after the first push to pos23, the agent is at pos33. Then, they can move to pos34 (down), then to pos24 (left?), but I need to check the movement directions.

Alternatively, the agent could move from pos33 to pos32 (up), then to pos22 (left), then to pos23 (down). But pos23 is occupied by the stone. So that's not possible.

Alternatively, after pushing the stone to pos23, the agent is at pos33. To get to pos23, the agent would need to move west (dirleft) from pos33 to pos23, but pos23 is occupied by the stone, so the move is not allowed. Therefore, the agent can't get to pos23 unless they push the stone from pos23 to some other position. But if they do that, then the stone would be moved again, but the goal is to have it at pos13. So this seems conflicting.

Alternatively, maybe the agent can push the stone from pos23 to pos13, which would move the agent to pos23. Because when you push the stone from pos23 to pos13 (dirleft), the agent must be at pos33 (east of pos23) and push it west. Wait, no: to push from pos23 to pos13, the agent must be at pos33 (east of pos23) and push left. So after pushing, the stone is at pos13, and the agent is at pos23. Ah, that's a possibility.

So here's the plan:

1. Move agent from pos41 to pos43 (to get behind the stone at pos33).

   - Move path: pos41 → pos42 (dirdown) → pos43 (dirdown). Or pos41 → pos31 (dirleft) → pos32 (dirdown) → pos33 (dirdown)? Wait, pos41 can move to pos31 via dirleft. Then from pos31 to pos32 (dirdown). From pos32 to pos33 (dirdown). But pos33 has the stone, but according to the initial state, it's clear. So agent can move there? But no, because the stone is at pos33. Wait, but according to the problem's initial state, pos33 is clear. So the agent can move into pos33. Wait, but that would put the agent and stone in the same location, which is not allowed. Therefore, perhaps the initial state is incorrect, but we have to proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps the move is possible only if the target location is clear (agent not present). So if the stone is there, the target is not clear. Therefore, the agent cannot move into pos33. So the initial state's assertion that pos33 is clear is incorrect. This is very confusing. Maybe the problem intended that pos33 is not clear. But given the problem's statement, I have to proceed.

Assuming that pos33 is clear (agent can move there despite the stone), then moving the agent to pos33 would cause the stone to be there as well. But then, when the agent is at pos33, they can push the stone. However, in reality, the stone and agent can't be in the same location. Therefore, the correct approach is that the agent cannot move into pos33 because it's occupied by the stone, making it not clear. Therefore, the initial state must have a mistake, but we have to work around it.

Assuming pos33 is not clear (due to stone), then the agent cannot move there. So the agent must go around. To push the stone from pos33 to pos23, the agent needs to be at pos43 (east of pos33). So the agent moves from pos41 to pos43. Let's check the movement path.

From pos41, possible moves:

"You may move from location pos41 to location pos31 following direction dirleft"

"You may move from location pos41 to location pos51 following direction dirright"

"You may move from location pos41 to location pos42 following direction dirdown"

So the agent can move down to pos42, then down to pos43. So:

Action 1: move player1 pos41 pos42 dirdown

Action 2: move player1 pos42 pos43 dirdown

Now, agent is at pos43. Then, push the stone from pos33 to pos23 using pushtonongoal (since pos23 is not a goal). The direction from pos43 to pos33 is dirleft. So:

Action 3: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos33 pos23 dirleft

After this action, the agent is now at pos33, and the stone is at pos23. Now, the agent is at pos33. To push the stone further west to pos13, the agent needs to be at pos23's east (pos33) and push left. But pos23 is now occupied by the stone. So the agent can push from pos33 to pos23 (stone is there) to pos13. Wait, but the stone is at pos23. So to push it to pos13, the agent must be at pos23's east (pos33) and push left. So:

Action 4: pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos23 pos13 dirleft

After this, the stone is at pos13 (goal), and the agent is at pos23. This satisfies the task's goal. Also, the agent is at pos23 in the final state. The constraint requires that in some state, the agent is at pos23. Additionally, if the agent is at pos23, there must be an earlier state where either stone1 is at pos21 or pos52 is not clear.

In the plan above, the agent reaches pos23 in action 4. Let's check the earlier states. Before action4, in action3, after pushing, the stone is at pos23, and the agent is at pos33. Then, in action4, the agent pushes from pos33 to pos23, moving to pos23. The earlier state before action4 has stone1 at pos23, which is not pos21. Also, pos52: was it ever not clear? Initially, pos52 is clear, and in the plan, the agent moves through pos41 → pos42 → pos43. So pos52 remains clear. Therefore, the constraint is not met. The agent is at pos23 in action4's effect, but there's no earlier state where stone1 was at pos21 or pos52 was not clear. Therefore, this plan doesn't satisfy the constraints.

So the plan needs to be adjusted to meet the constraint. The constraint says that whenever the agent is at pos23, there must be an earlier state where stone1 was at pos21 or pos52 was not clear. So, in the current plan, the agent is at pos23 in the final state. Therefore, we need to ensure that before that, either stone1 was at pos21 or pos52 was blocked.

Since the stone is moved from pos33 → pos23 → pos13, it never goes to pos21. So the only option is to make pos52 not clear at some point before the agent reaches pos23.

How to make pos52 not clear? The agent or a stone must be there. But stones are only stone1, which is moved to pos13. The agent can move to pos52. So if the agent moves to pos52 at some point, then pos52 is not clear. So maybe the agent can take a detour to pos52 before reaching pos23.

But how? The agent starts at pos41. To get to pos52, they can move right to pos51, then down to pos52. Let's see:

From pos41, move right (dirright) to pos51. Then down (dirdown) to pos52. Then do something there. Then continue to pos43 to push the stone. This would make pos52 not clear (agent is there) in an earlier state. Then, when the agent is at pos23, the earlier state where pos52 was not clear (because the agent was there) would satisfy the constraint.

So integrating this into the plan:

Action1: move player1 pos41 pos51 dirright

Action2: move player1 pos51 pos52 dirdown

Now, pos52 is not clear (agent is there). Then, move back to pos51, then to pos41, then proceed to pos43 as before.

But this adds extra steps. The optimal plan needs to be as short as possible. Let's see:

Original plan without constraint was 4 actions. With the detour, it becomes longer. Need to find a way to satisfy the constraint with minimal steps.

Alternatively, when the agent is at pos23 in the final step, ensure that there's an earlier state where pos52 was not clear. So if the agent visits pos52 before pushing the stone, then pos52 is not clear. But how to do this efficiently.

Alternative plan:

1. Move agent from pos41 to pos51 (dirright).

2. Move to pos52 (dirdown).

3. Move back to pos51 (dirup).

4. Move to pos41 (dirleft).

5. Move to pos42 (dirdown).

6. Move to pos43 (dirdown).

7. Push stone from pos33 to pos23.

8. Push stone from pos23 to pos13, arriving at pos23.

This way, in step 2, pos52 is not clear (agent is there). Then, in step 8, the agent is at pos23. The earlier state (step2) has pos52 not clear. Thus, satisfying the constraint. But this adds 4 extra steps (steps1-4), making the plan longer. But the problem requires an optimal plan with minimal length. Is there a shorter way?

Alternatively, can the agent visit pos52 while moving towards pos43? For example:

From pos41 → pos42 → pos43 is the original path. But if instead, the agent goes pos41 → pos42 → pos52? Wait, pos42 is at row4, column2. From pos42, allowed moves are to pos32 (dirleft), pos52 (dirright), pos41 (dirup), pos43 (dirdown). So from pos42, the agent can move right to pos52. Then, after visiting pos52, come back.

So:

Action1: move player1 pos41 pos42 dirdown

Action2: move player1 pos42 pos52 dirright

Now, pos52 is not clear. Then:

Action3: move player1 pos52 pos42 dirleft

Action4: move player1 pos42 pos43 dirdown

Action5: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos33 pos23 dirleft

Action6: pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos23 pos13 dirleft

Now, the agent is at pos23 in action6. The constraint is satisfied because in action2, pos52 was not clear. So this adds two extra actions (actions2 and 3) compared to the original plan. The original plan had 4 actions, this one has 6. But maybe there's a shorter path.

Alternative idea: After moving to pos43, push the stone east to pos43 (dirright), but that's not useful. Alternatively, maybe the agent can push the stone south to pos34, then west to pos24, etc. But the goal is pos13.

Alternatively, after pushing the stone to pos23, the agent can go to pos22, then to pos23. But how? After pushing to pos23, the agent is at pos33. To get to pos23, they need to move west (dirleft) to pos23, but that's blocked by the stone. So no.

Alternative approach: Use the fact that when pushing the stone from pos33 to pos23, the agent ends up at pos33. Then, the agent can move up to pos32, then left to pos22, then down to pos23. But pos23 has the stone, so they can't move there. So that's not possible.

Alternatively, after pushing the stone to pos23, the agent moves up to pos32, then left to pos22, then down to pos23 (but pos23 is occupied). So that doesn't work.

Alternatively, after the first push to pos23, the agent moves from pos33 to pos34 (dirdown), then to pos44 (dirright), then to pos54 (dirdown), then to pos53 (dirleft), then to pos52 (dirup). Then pos52 is occupied. Then move back. But this is very long.

Alternatively, after the first push, the agent goes to pos34, then to pos35, then to pos45, then to pos55, then to pos54, etc. This seems inefficient.

Wait, maybe the agent can, after pushing the stone to pos23, move east to pos43, then south to pos44, then west to pos34, etc. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, after pushing the stone to pos23, the agent needs to reach pos23. But the only way to be at pos23 is to push the stone there and end up there. Wait, when pushing from pos23 to pos13, the agent must be at pos33 and push dirleft. Then, the agent moves to pos23. So in that case, the agent is at pos23. But how to ensure that before that, pos52 was not clear or the stone was at pos21.

But in the original plan, when the agent is at pos23 (after pushing to pos13), the earlier states have the stone at pos23 and pos33. Neither of which is pos21. So the only way to satisfy the constraint is to have pos52 not clear in an earlier state.

So the minimal plan would require the agent to visit pos52 before the final step. Let's see:

Plan:

1. move player1 pos41 pos42 dirdown

2. move player1 pos42 pos52 dirright (now at pos52, which is not clear)

3. move player1 pos52 pos42 dirleft

4. move player1 pos42 pos43 dirdown

5. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos33 pos23 dirleft

6. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos23 pos13 dirleft

Now, in step6, agent is at pos23. The earlier state in step2 has pos52 not clear. So this satisfies the constraint. This plan has 6 actions. Is there a shorter way?

Alternative path: After step2, can the agent go directly to pos43 from pos52? Let's see: from pos52, the allowed moves are to pos42 (dirleft), pos51 (dirup), pos53 (dirdown). To get to pos43 from pos52, the agent would have to go pos52 → pos42 → pos43. So steps as above.

Alternatively, is there a way to have the agent visit pos52 during the movement to pos43 without adding steps? For example:

From pos41 → pos51 (dirright), then pos51 → pos52 (dirdown), then pos52 → pos42 (dirleft), then pos42 → pos43 (dirdown). Then proceed. This would be:

1. move pos41 to pos51 (dirright)

2. move pos51 to pos52 (dirdown)

3. move pos52 to pos42 (dirleft)

4. move pos42 to pos43 (dirdown)

5. pushtonongoal pos43 pos33 pos23 dirleft

6. pushtogoal pos33 pos23 pos13 dirleft

This is also 6 actions. So same length.

Is there a way to do it in 5 actions? Let's see.

What if after moving to pos52, the agent pushes a stone there. But there's no stone at pos52. The only stone is at pos33 initially. So can't do that.

Alternatively, perhaps combining some movements. For example, can the agent move from pos41 to pos42 to pos52 in two actions, then to pos42 and pos43 in two more, then push twice. Total 6 actions. Same as before.

So it seems the minimal plan with the constraint requires 6 actions.

But wait, the original plan (without the constraint) had 4 actions. Adding two more to visit pos52 makes it 6. But maybe there's a smarter way to satisfy the constraint without adding two actions.

Let me think differently. The constraint says that if the agent is at pos23 in any state, then there must be an earlier state where stone1 was at pos21 or pos52 was not clear. So, in the final plan, when the agent is at pos23 (after pushing to pos13), we need to have either:

- Earlier, stone1 was at pos21.

OR

- Earlier, pos52 was not clear.

If we can arrange for the stone to pass through pos21 on its way to pos13, then that would satisfy the constraint. But how?

The stone starts at pos33. To get to pos21, it would need to be pushed west to pos23, then north to pos22, then west to pos21. Then from pos21, south to pos22, east to pos23, then west to pos13. That's a long way. But it would make the stone pass through pos21, satisfying the constraint. However, this adds many steps, making the plan longer. The optimal plan needs to be as short as possible, so this is not ideal.

Alternatively, is there a way to push the stone to pos21 briefly? For example:

From pos33 → pos23 (pushtonongoal), then pos23 → pos22 (dirup), but how? To push north, the agent needs to be south of the stone. So pushing from pos23 to pos22 would require the agent to be at pos24 (south of pos23) and push north. But pos24 is not clear. The initial state says pos24 is clear. Wait, initial state: "Location pos24 is clear". Yes. So after pushing the stone to pos23, the agent is at pos33. To push the stone north to pos22, the agent needs to be south of pos23 (pos33 is north of pos23?), wait no. Pos23 is row2, column3. South would be pos33 (row3, column3). Wait, no. The positions are named posXY where X is row and Y is column. So pos23 is row2, column3. South of pos23 is pos33. So to push north from pos23 to pos13, the agent needs to be south of pos23 (pos33) and push north (dirup). But pos13 is west of pos23. Wait, I'm getting confused with directions.

Wait, the directions:

"dirup" and "dirdown" probably correspond to rows. For example, moving up from pos23 would decrease the row number (to pos13?), but no. Let's look at the allowed movements.

Looking at the allowed moves for pos23:

"You may move from location pos23 to location pos13 following direction dirleft"

Wait, pos23's allowed moves:

- pos13 (dirleft), pos33 (dirright), pos22 (dirup), pos24 (dirdown).

So pos23 can move left to pos13, right to pos33, up to pos22, or down to pos24.

Therefore, to push the stone north (dirup) from pos23 to pos22, the agent must be south of pos23 (pos33) and push dirup. So the agent is at pos33, pushes the stone dirup to pos22. Then, the stone is at pos22. But that's not helpful for the goal. But if the stone is at pos22, then to get to pos21, the agent can push it west from pos22 to pos21. Then, the stone is at pos21. This would satisfy the constraint when the agent is later at pos23. So:

Plan:

1. Move agent to pos43.

2. Push stone from pos33 to pos23.

3. Push stone from pos23 to pos22 (dirup).

4. Push stone from pos22 to pos21 (dirleft).

5. Push stone from pos21 to pos11 (dirleft?), but pos11 is a goal? No, pos13 is the only goal. So this is not helpful. This approach makes the stone go to pos21, which satisfies the constraint, but then the stone needs to be moved back to pos13, which is longer. Therefore, this plan would be longer than necessary.

Thus, it's better to go with the earlier approach of visiting pos52 to satisfy the constraint.

So the optimal plan is:

```
move player1 pos41 pos42 dirdown
move player1 pos42 pos52 dirright
move player1 pos52 pos42 dirleft
move player1 pos42 pos43 dirdown
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos33 pos23 dirleft
pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos23 pos13 dirleft
```

This plan has 6 actions. The agent moves to pos52 (making pos52 not clear), then back, then pushes the stone twice. This satisfies the constraint because when the agent is at pos23 in the final step, there's an earlier state (action2) where pos52 was not clear.

Now, check if all preconditions are met.

Action1: move from pos41 to pos42. pos42 is clear (initial state). Preconditions met.

Action2: move from pos42 to pos52. pos52 is clear (initial state). Preconditions met.

Action3: move from pos52 to pos42. pos42 is clear (after action1 and action2, agent left pos42 in action2, so it's clear). Preconditions met.

Action4: move from pos42 to pos43. pos43 is clear (initial state). Preconditions met.

Action5: pushtonongoal. Agent is at pos43. Stone is at pos33. pos33 is clear? Initial state says pos33 is clear (but stone is there). Assuming that "clear" refers to agent not present, then pos33 has the stone but is considered clear for the agent's movement. But for pushing, the stone must be at l_from (pos33). Preconditions:

- Agent at pos43 (yes).

- Stone at pos33 (yes).

- l_to pos23 is clear (yes, initially pos23 is clear).

- Can move from pos43 to pos33 (dirleft) as per allowed moves (yes).

- Can move from pos33 to pos23 (dirleft) (yes).

- l_to (pos23) is not a goal (correct, since pos23 is not a goal). So preconditions met.

After action5: agent is at pos33, stone at pos23. pos43 is clear.

Action6: pushtogoal. Agent at pos33. Stone at pos23. pos13 is a goal.

Preconditions:

- Agent at pos33 (yes).

- Stone at pos23 (yes).

- l_to pos13 is clear (yes).

- Can move from pos33 to pos23 (dirleft) (yes).

- Can move from pos23 to pos13 (dirleft) (yes).

- pos13 is a goal (yes). So preconditions met.

After action6: agent is at pos23, stone at pos13 (goal). All constraints satisfied.

The constraint that when the agent is at pos23 (action6), there's an earlier state where pos52 was not clear (action2) is satisfied. Therefore, this plan is valid and meets all requirements.
