Okay, let's try to figure out how to solve this planning problem. The goal is to get stone1 to a goal location, which is pos13 in this case. Let me start by understanding the initial state and the available actions.

So, initially, the agent (player1) is at pos41. Stone1 is at pos33. The goal location is pos13. All other locations are either non-goal or unclear. The agent needs to move to the stone and push it to the goal.

First, I need to check the movement paths. The allowed moves between locations are defined. For example, from pos41, the agent can go to pos31 (dirleft) or pos51 (dirright), or down to pos42 (dirdown). Since the stone is at pos33, which is in the 3rd row and 3rd column, I need to find a path for the agent to get to a position adjacent to the stone so they can push it.

Looking at pos33, the adjacent locations would be pos23 (left), pos43 (right), pos32 (up), and pos34 (down). The agent needs to reach one of these positions to push the stone. Let's see the possible paths.

Starting at pos41. Let's see how to get to pos33's adjacent locations. From pos41, the agent can move to pos31 (dirleft), then from pos31, they can go to pos21 (dirleft) or pos41 (dirright?), wait no. Wait, the movement from pos31: according to the given moves, pos31 can go to pos21 (dirleft), pos41 (dirright?), or down to pos32 (dirdown). Wait, let me check again.

The movement from pos31 is:

"You may move from location pos31 to location pos21 following direction dirleft"
"You may move from location pos31 to location pos41 following direction dirright"
"You may move from location pos31 to location pos32 following direction dirdown"

So from pos31, moving dirright would take the agent to pos41 again, which is not helpful. But moving dirleft would take them to pos21. Hmm, perhaps that's not the right path. Alternatively, from pos41, moving down (dirdown) to pos42. Let's check the moves from pos42.

From pos42, directions are:

"You may move from location pos42 to location pos32 following direction dirleft"
"You may move from location pos42 to location pos52 following direction dirright"
"You may move from location pos42 to location pos41 following direction dirup"
"You may move from location pos42 to location pos43 following direction dirdown"

If the agent moves from pos41 to pos42 (dirdown), then from pos42, they can move to pos43 (dirdown), then pos43 can go to pos33 (dirleft) or pos53 (dirright), etc. Wait, pos43's moves: "You may move from location pos43 to location pos33 following direction dirleft" — that's key. So if the agent can get to pos43, they can push the stone from pos33 to pos23 (dirleft) which is a non-goal, but we need to push it towards the goal. Wait, the goal is pos13, which is in the first row, third column. So to get stone1 from pos33 (third row, third column) to pos13, the agent would need to push it up twice (from pos33 to pos23, then pos23 to pos13), but wait, pos23 is not a goal. But pos13 is a goal. So the stone needs to reach pos13.

But how can the agent push it up? Let's map the path. Let's see:

Stone is at pos33. To push it up to pos23, the agent needs to be at pos32 (since pushing from the direction of the stone's movement. Wait, pushing requires the agent to be adjacent to the stone in the direction opposite to where the stone is moving. For example, to push the stone up (dirup) from pos33 to pos23, the agent must be at pos33's down direction, which is pos43? Wait, no. Wait, the direction here might be relative. Let me think again.

The "pushtogoal" and "pushtonongoal" actions require that the agent can move from their current position to the stone's position (l_from) in direction d, and then the stone moves from l_from to l_to in direction d. So the direction is the direction the agent is moving towards the stone, and then the stone moves in the same direction. For example, if the agent is at pos43 and pushes the stone at pos33 to pos23, the direction would be dirup. Wait, no. Let's clarify.

The direction in the push actions refers to the direction from the agent's position (l_p) to the stone's position (l_from). So if the agent is at pos43 and the stone is at pos33, then the direction from pos43 to pos33 is dirup (since pos33 is above pos43). Wait, maybe not. Let me check the movement directions.

In the movement from pos43 to pos33, the direction is dirleft. Wait, no. Wait, the movement directions are given as:

"You may move from location pos43 to location pos33 following direction dirleft"

So pos43's left is pos33. So direction dirleft from pos43 leads to pos33. Therefore, if the agent is at pos43, moving dirleft takes them to pos33. Similarly, to push the stone from pos33 to pos23 (which is to the left of pos33), the direction would be dirleft. So the agent needs to be at pos33's right (pos34?) to push it left. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused here.

Alternatively, the agent is at pos43 (south of pos33), and wants to push the stone north (dirup) to pos23? No, that's not possible. Wait, the direction for pushing would be the direction the agent moves towards the stone. So, for example, if the agent is at pos43 (south of pos33) and wants to push the stone north (towards pos23), the direction would be dirup. Then, the agent moves from pos43 to pos33 (direction dirup?), but according to movement rules, moving from pos43 to pos33 is dirleft. So perhaps the directions are not the compass directions but relative to the grid. Wait, the directions are named dirup, dirdown, dirleft, dirright, but their actual mapping depends on the movement allowed between locations.

For example, moving from pos43 to pos33 is dirleft. So, in this case, dirleft is the direction from pos43 to pos33. Therefore, if the agent is at pos43 and wants to push the stone at pos33 to pos23, they would have to move dirleft to pos33 (the stone's current location), and then the stone moves dirleft to pos23. So the direction for the push action would be dirleft. The preconditions for pushtogoal or pushtonongoal would require that the agent is at l_p (pos43), the stone is at l_from (pos33), and that the direction from l_p to l_from is dirleft. Then, the direction from l_from (pos33) to l_to (pos23) must also be dirleft. And pos23 is not a goal, so we need to use pushtonongoal here. But then, pushing again from pos23 to pos13 would require the agent to be at pos24? Wait, pos23's left is pos13. So if the stone is at pos23, the agent can be at pos33 (but that's where the stone was) or maybe pos24. Hmm, this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, maybe there's a more straightforward path. Let's try to plan step by step.

Initial state:

- Agent at pos41.
- Stone1 at pos33.
- Goal is pos13 (a goal location).

We need to get the stone to pos13.

Possible steps:

1. Move agent from pos41 to pos42 (dirdown).
2. Move agent from pos42 to pos43 (dirdown).
3. From pos43, push the stone from pos33 to pos23 (dirleft). But pos23 is not a goal. So this would be a pushtonongoal action. But after that, the stone is at pos23. Then, we need to push it again from pos23 to pos13. But to do that, the agent would need to be in a position adjacent to pos23 in the direction towards pos13. Since pos13 is left of pos23, the agent would need to be to the right of pos23 (pos24?), but let's check the movement paths.

Wait, pos23's adjacent locations are pos13 (left), pos33 (right), pos22 (up), pos24 (down). So to push the stone from pos23 to pos13 (left), the agent needs to be at pos24 (south of pos23) and push up? Or perhaps from pos23's right (pos33) which is where the stone was initially. Hmm, maybe not. Wait, the agent needs to be adjacent to the stone's current position in the direction they want to push. For example, to push the stone from pos23 to pos13 (left), the agent must be at pos24 (south of pos23) and move up to pos23, pushing the stone left. Wait, no. The direction in the push action is the direction from the agent's current position to the stone's position, and then the stone moves in the same direction.

Wait, let's clarify the push action's direction. For example, in the action "pushtonongoal p s l_p l_from l_to d", the agent is at l_p, the stone is at l_from. The direction d must allow moving from l_p to l_from (so l_from is reachable from l_p via direction d), and then from l_from to l_to via the same direction d. So, the direction d is the same for both steps. Therefore, if the agent is at l_p and moves in direction d to reach l_from (stone's location), then the stone moves in direction d from l_from to l_to.

So, for example, if the agent is at pos43 (l_p), and the stone is at pos33 (l_from), and the direction is dirleft (since moving from pos43 to pos33 is dirleft), then the stone would move dirleft from pos33 to pos23 (l_to). So that's a valid pushtonongoal action. Then, the stone is at pos23. Now, to push it to pos13, the agent needs to be at a position l_p that can move to pos23 via direction d, and pos23 can move via direction d to pos13. So direction d must be dirleft again. So the agent would need to be at pos23's right (pos24?), but pos24 is east of pos23? Wait, according to the movement rules, can the agent move from pos24 to pos23? Let's check.

Looking at the movement allowed for pos24:

"You may move from location pos24 to location pos14 following direction dirleft"
"You may move from location pos24 to location pos34 following direction dirright"
"You may move from location pos24 to location pos23 following direction dirup"
"You may move from location pos24 to location pos25 following direction dirdown"

So from pos24, moving dirup takes the agent to pos23. So direction dirup. Therefore, if the agent is at pos24 and wants to push the stone from pos23 to pos13 (dirleft), the direction would be dirup (from pos24 to pos23). Then, after moving dirup to pos23, the stone would move dirup from pos23. But moving dirup from pos23 would go to pos13? Wait, no. Let's check the movement from pos23:

"You may move from location pos23 to location pos13 following direction dirleft"
"You may move from location pos23 to location pos33 following direction dirright"
"You may move from location pos23 to location pos22 following direction dirup"
"You may move from location pos23 to location pos24 following direction dirdown"

Wait, that's confusing. So moving dirleft from pos23 takes you to pos13. Moving dirup from pos23 takes you to pos22. So if the direction in the push action is dirleft, then the stone would move from pos23 to pos13. So the agent would need to be at pos24, move dirup to pos23 (stone's location), then the stone moves dirup? No, wait. The direction in the push action must be the same for both moving the agent to the stone and moving the stone to its new location.

Wait, the direction in the push action is such that from the agent's position (l_p), moving in direction d takes them to l_from (stone's current position). Then, from l_from, moving in direction d takes the stone to l_to. So in this case, to push the stone from pos23 to pos13 (dirleft), the agent must be at a position l_p such that moving dirleft from l_p leads to pos23. What positions can reach pos23 via dirleft? For example, pos24 can reach pos23 via dirup (as per movement rules), not dirleft. Hmm, maybe this is getting too complicated.

Alternative approach: after pushing the stone from pos33 to pos23 using the agent at pos43 (dirleft), the stone is at pos23. Now, the agent is at pos33 (since after pushing, the agent moves to l_from, which is pos33). Wait, no. The effect of pushtonongoal is that the agent moves from l_p (pos43) to l_from (pos33). So after pushing, the agent is now at pos33, and the stone is at pos23. Then, to push the stone from pos23 to pos13, the agent needs to be at a position l_p such that moving direction d leads to pos23, and from pos23, moving direction d leads to pos13. Let's find such a direction.

Looking at the movement from pos23: moving dirleft takes you to pos13. So direction dirleft. So the agent needs to be at a position l_p where moving dirleft leads to pos23. Which positions can do that? For example, pos24: moving dirup leads to pos23. No. pos33: moving dirleft from pos33 would go to pos23? Let's check. From pos33's movement options:

"You may move from location pos33 to location pos23 following direction dirleft"
"You may move from location pos33 to location pos43 following direction dirright"
"You may move from location pos33 to location pos32 following direction dirup"
"You may move from location pos33 to location pos34 following direction dirdown"

Yes, moving dirleft from pos33 takes you to pos23. So if the agent is at pos33 and wants to push the stone from pos23 to pos13, direction dirleft. But the agent can't be at pos33 if the stone is at pos23. Because after the first push, the agent is at pos33, but the stone is at pos23. So the agent is at pos33, which is clear. So the agent can then move to pos23's adjacent positions.

Wait, after the first push, the agent is at pos33 (since l_from is pos33, and the agent moves there). Wait, the effect of pushtonongoal: agent p is at location l_from (pos33). Then, the stone is at l_to (pos23). So after the first push, the agent is at pos33, stone is at pos23. Now, to push the stone from pos23 to pos13, the agent needs to be at a position that allows moving to pos23 via some direction, and that direction also moves pos23 to pos13. The direction that moves pos23 to pos13 is dirleft. So the agent needs to be at a position l_p from which moving dirleft leads to pos23. Which positions are those? For example, pos24: can you move dirleft from pos24 to pos23? Looking at pos24's movement options:

From pos24: moving dirup takes you to pos23. So direction dirup. So if the agent is at pos24 and moves dirup to pos23, then the stone would move dirup to pos13? Wait, no. Because the direction in the push action must be the same. So if the agent is at pos24, moves dirup to pos23 (stone's location), then the stone would move dirup from pos23. But moving dirup from pos23 takes you to pos22, not pos13. So that's not the right direction. Therefore, the direction needs to be dirleft. So where can the agent be to reach pos23 via dirleft? Looking at the movement options, the only way to reach pos23 via dirleft is from pos24? Wait, no. Wait, the movement from pos23's left is pos13. So perhaps the agent needs to be at pos23's right (pos24) and move dirleft. But according to the movement rules, moving from pos24 to pos23 is dirup, not dirleft. So that's not possible.

Alternatively, maybe the agent can be at pos33 (current location after the first push) and then move to pos23's right side (pos24?), but that's not directly connected. Let's see. The agent is at pos33. From there, they can move dirup to pos32, or dirright to pos43, or dirleft to pos23 (but pos23 has the stone now, which is not clear). Wait, after the first push, the stone is at pos23. So pos23 is not clear anymore. Therefore, the agent can't move into pos23. So the agent is at pos33, and needs to find a way to get around.

Wait, after the first push (stone at pos23, agent at pos33), the agent can move from pos33 to pos32 (dirup), pos34 (dirdown), pos43 (dirright), or pos23 (dirleft) but pos23 is occupied by the stone. So the agent can't go to pos23. So the agent is at pos33. To push the stone from pos23 to pos13, the agent needs to get to a position where they can push it. But how? Maybe the agent needs to go around to pos24, then push up. Let's think.

From pos33, the agent can move dirup to pos32. Then, pos32 can go to pos22 (dirleft) or pos42 (dirright) or pos31 (dirup) or pos33 (dirdown). Alternatively, the agent can move from pos33 to pos34 (dirdown), then to pos44 (dirright?), but that seems longer.

Alternatively, agent at pos33 moves dirup to pos32. Then pos32 can move dirleft to pos22. From pos22, maybe move dirup to pos21, then left to pos11? Not helpful. Alternatively, from pos32, the agent can move dirleft to pos22. Then, from pos22, move dirleft to pos12. Not helpful.

This seems complicated. Maybe there's a better path. Let's think again. The initial plan:

1. Agent moves from pos41 to pos42 (dirdown).
2. Agent moves from pos42 to pos43 (dirdown).
3. Agent pushes stone from pos33 to pos23 (dirleft) using pushtonongoal. Now, stone is at pos23, agent is at pos33.
4. Now, agent needs to get to a position where they can push the stone from pos23 to pos13. The direction needed is dirleft (since moving dirleft from pos23 takes you to pos13). So agent needs to be at a position that allows moving dirleft to pos23. Which positions can do that? According to movement rules, the only way to move to pos23 via dirleft would be from pos24? Wait, no. pos23's movement options are:

"You may move from location pos23 to location pos13 following direction dirleft"
"You may move from location pos23 to location pos33 following direction dirright"
"You may move from location pos23 to location pos22 following direction dirup"
"You may move from location pos23 to location pos24 following direction dirdown"

So to reach pos23 via dirleft, you must be coming from pos24 (but dirleft from pos24 is not possible). Wait, pos24's movement options include moving dirup to pos23. So the direction to reach pos23 from pos24 is dirup, not dirleft. Therefore, to push the stone from pos23 to pos13 (dirleft), the agent needs to be at a position that can reach pos23 via dirleft. But according to the movement rules, no such position exists. Because moving dirleft to pos23 would require being east of pos23 (pos24 is south of pos23). Wait, maybe the agent is at pos13, but that's the goal location and not clear.

Alternatively, maybe the agent can move around to pos22 and then push the stone. Let's see. After the first push, agent is at pos33. They can move to pos32 (dirup), then to pos22 (dirleft). From pos22, can they push the stone at pos23? The stone is at pos23. The agent is at pos22. To push the stone from pos23, the agent needs to be adjacent in a direction that allows moving to pos23. From pos22, moving dirdown takes them to pos23. So direction dirdown. Then, pushing the stone from pos23 in direction dirdown would take it to pos24. But we want to push it to pos13. So this isn't helpful.

Alternatively, the agent is at pos33 and moves to pos34 (dirdown). From pos34, can they go to pos24 (dirleft)? Yes. From pos34, movement options include dirleft to pos24. Then from pos24, move dirup to pos23. Now the agent is at pos23, but the stone is already there. Wait, no. After the first push, the stone is at pos23. So pos23 is not clear. Therefore, the agent can't move there. So this approach doesn't work.

Hmm, this is tricky. Maybe the initial approach of pushing the stone to pos23 is not the right way. Let's consider alternative paths. For example, can the agent push the stone upwards from pos33 to pos32? Let's check. To push upwards, the agent needs to be south of pos33 (pos43) and move north (dirup). Wait, moving from pos43 to pos33 is dirleft. So direction dirleft. Then the stone would move dirleft to pos23. That's what we did before. So no, that's not helpful.

Alternatively, maybe pushing the stone to the right. From pos33, pushing right to pos43 (if that's possible). But pos43 is a non-goal location, so we'd use pushtonongoal. But then the stone is further away from the goal. Not helpful.

Wait, the goal is to get the stone to a goal location, which is pos13. So we have to find a path to move it there. Let's think about the possible paths again.

Another approach: agent moves from pos41 to pos31 (dirleft), then to pos21 (dirleft), then to pos11 (dirleft). But that's moving away from the stone. Not helpful.

Alternatively, agent moves from pos41 to pos42 (dirdown), then to pos43 (dirdown). From pos43, push the stone to pos33's right (pos43 is to the south of pos33). Wait, the stone is at pos33. To push it to the east (dirright), the agent would need to be west of pos33 (pos32?), but movement from pos32 to pos33 is dirdown. Wait, pos32's movement options: can move dirdown to pos33. So if the agent is at pos32 and pushes the stone at pos33 to the east (dirright?), then direction would be dirdown. Wait, this is confusing.

Alternatively, the agent is at pos43, pushes the stone to pos33's left (pos23). Then, the agent is at pos33. From there, agent can move up to pos32, then left to pos22, up to pos12, left to pos13 (the goal). But how to push the stone from pos23 to pos13.

Wait, after the first push, the stone is at pos23, agent at pos33. Then, the agent needs to get to pos24 to push the stone up to pos13. But how?

Let me try to outline the steps again:

1. Move agent from pos41 to pos42 (dirdown).
2. Move agent from pos42 to pos43 (dirdown).
3. Push the stone from pos33 to pos23 using pushtonongoal. Now stone is at pos23, agent at pos33.
4. Now, agent needs to move to pos24 to push the stone from pos23 to pos13. But how?

From pos33, the agent can move dirdown to pos34. Then, dirright to pos44? No. Or from pos34, move dirleft to pos24. So:

4. Move agent from pos33 to pos34 (dirdown).
5. Move agent from pos34 to pos24 (dirleft).
6. Now, agent is at pos24. From here, they can push the stone from pos23 to pos13. Let's check the directions.

From pos24, moving dirup takes the agent to pos23. Direction d is dirup. Then, the stone moves dirup from pos23. But dirup from pos23 leads to pos22, not pos13. So that's not helpful.

Alternatively, to push the stone from pos23 to pos13 (dirleft), the agent needs to be at a position where moving dirleft to pos23. Which direction would that be? Looking at pos13's movement options, but pos13 is east of pos23. So the agent needs to be east of pos23 (pos24?) and move west (dirleft) to pos23. Let's check.

pos24's movement options include moving dirup to pos23. So direction dirup. If the agent is at pos24 and pushes the stone from pos23 to pos13, the direction would have to be dirup, but moving dirup from pos23 takes you to pos22. So that's not possible. Therefore, this approach doesn't work.

Alternative idea: after the stone is at pos23, the agent needs to move to pos13's east side (pos14?) to push it west. But pos13 is a goal location. Let's see. If the agent is at pos14, they can push the stone from pos13 to pos03 (which doesn't exist). Not helpful.

Alternatively, maybe there's a different path to get the stone to pos13. Let's think of moving the stone up through pos32 and pos22 to pos12 and then to pos13. But that would require the agent to push the stone upwards, which might not be possible given the movement directions.

Wait, initial stone position is pos33. To push it up to pos32 (north), the agent needs to be south of pos33 (pos43) and move north (dirleft) to pos33, then the stone moves north to pos32. Let's see:

Agent moves from pos41 to pos42, then to pos43. Then, push the stone from pos33 to pos32 (dirleft). Wait, pos33 to pos32 is moving dirup. So the direction would be dirup. But the agent is at pos43, moving dirleft to pos33. So direction dirleft. Then the stone would move dirleft to pos23. Not pos32. Hmm.

Alternatively, if the agent is at pos32, they can push the stone from pos33 to pos34 (dirdown). But that's moving it away from the goal. Not helpful.

This is getting really complicated. Maybe I need to find the shortest path for the agent to reach a position where they can push the stone directly towards the goal.

Wait, the goal is pos13. The stone is at pos33. The straight-line path is two moves to the left (west). But the agent needs to push it twice: once to pos23, then again to pos13. But the problem is how to perform the second push.

Let me try to outline the steps again:

1. Agent moves from pos41 to pos42 (dirdown).
2. Agent moves from pos42 to pos43 (dirdown).
3. Agent pushes stone from pos33 to pos23 using pushtonongoal. Now, stone is at pos23, agent at pos33.
4. Now, agent needs to get to pos24 to push the stone from pos23 to pos13.

But from pos33, how to get to pos24? The agent is at pos33. Possible moves: pos33 can go to pos32 (dirup), pos34 (dirdown), pos43 (dirright), or pos23 (dirleft) which is occupied.

So agent moves to pos34 (dirdown), then from pos34 to pos24 (dirleft). Now at pos24. Then, push the stone from pos23 to pos13. To do this, the agent needs to move dirup from pos24 to pos23 (which is stone's current location), but pos23 is occupied. So can't do that. Therefore, this approach doesn't work.

Alternative idea: after pushing the stone to pos23, the agent is at pos33. They can move to pos34 (dirdown), then to pos44 (dirright), then to pos54 (dirright), etc., but that's not helpful.

Wait, maybe there's another path. Let's consider the agent moving from pos33 to pos32 (dirup). From pos32, they can move dirleft to pos22. From pos22, move dirleft to pos12. From pos12, move dirleft to pos13 (the goal location). But pos13 is a goal. But the agent can't push the stone from pos23 to pos13 unless they are adjacent and in the right direction.

Alternatively, the agent moves from pos33 to pos32 (dirup), then to pos22 (dirleft), then to pos12 (dirleft), then to pos13 (dirleft). But the agent can't push the stone from pos23 unless they are adjacent.

This seems stuck. Perhaps there's a different initial path. Maybe the agent should approach the stone from the north instead of the south.

Original agent position: pos41. To reach the north side of the stone (pos33), the agent would need to go up to pos31, then to pos21, pos22, pos23, but that's a long way.

Alternative path:

1. Move agent from pos41 to pos31 (dirleft).
2. Move from pos31 to pos21 (dirleft).
3. Move from pos21 to pos22 (dirdown).
4. Move from pos22 to pos23 (dirdown).
5. Now, agent is at pos23. But the stone is at pos33. To push it up, but the agent is north of the stone. So agent at pos23 can push the stone south to pos43, but that's away from the goal.

Not helpful. So this approach isn't better.

Hmm, maybe the optimal plan is to push the stone twice: once to pos23, then the agent moves around to pos24 and pushes it again to pos13. But how?

After the first push, the stone is at pos23, agent at pos33. Agent needs to move to pos24. To do that:

4. Agent moves from pos33 to pos34 (dirdown).
5. Agent moves from pos34 to pos24 (dirleft).

Now at pos24. From here, can the agent push the stone from pos23 to pos13? Let's check the movement directions.

From pos24, moving dirup takes you to pos23. So direction dirup. Then, the stone would move dirup from pos23 to pos22. That's not helpful. We need the stone to move dirleft from pos23 to pos13. So the direction must be dirleft. But the agent is at pos24, and moving dirup to pos23 (direction dirup). Then, the stone would move dirup (to pos22). That's wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the agent can move from pos24 to pos14 (dirleft). Then from pos14, move dirup to pos13. But pos13 is the goal. Then, the agent can push the stone from pos23 to pos13 from the east side? Not sure.

This is getting too complex. Let's try to write out the possible steps again:

Initial plan:

1. move player1 pos41 pos42 dirdown
2. move player1 pos42 pos43 dirdown
3. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos33 pos23 dirleft

Now, stone1 is at pos23 (non-goal), agent is at pos33.

Next steps:

4. move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown
5. move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft
6. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos23 pos13 dirup? But pos23 to pos13 is dirleft. So direction should be dirleft. Wait, agent is at pos24. To move to pos23, the direction is dirup. So the action would be pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos23 pos13 dirup. But does pos23 to pos13 follow dirup? No. pos23 to pos13 is dirleft. So the direction for the stone's movement must be the same as the agent's movement. Therefore, this isn't possible.

So the agent's movement direction must match the stone's movement direction. Therefore, this approach won't work.

Alternative plan: after the first push, the agent is at pos33. They can move to pos32 (dirup), then to pos22 (dirleft), then to pos23 (dirdown). But pos23 has the stone, so they can't move there. So that's not possible.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Let's think differently. The problem requires moving the stone to any goal location. The only goal location is pos13. So the stone must end up at pos13.

Another idea: can the agent push the stone upwards twice? From pos33 to pos23, then to pos13. But how to do the second push.

After the first push to pos23, the agent is at pos33. To push the stone again to pos13, the agent needs to be at a position that allows pushing in dirleft. So from pos23's east side (pos24?), but moving from pos24 to pos23 is dirup, not dirleft. Therefore, the direction in the push action would be dirup, which would move the stone to pos22, which is not helpful.

Alternatively, the agent needs to be at pos13's east side (pos14) to push the stone west (dirleft) into pos13. But the stone is at pos23. So the agent would need to move from pos14 to pos13 (dirleft), but pos13 is a goal location and initially clear. But how to get the agent to pos14.

But after the first push, the stone is at pos23. The agent is at pos33. So the agent needs to move to pos34, pos44, pos43, etc.

This seems impossible. Maybe the initial approach is incorrect, and there's a shorter path.

Wait, wait! What if the agent pushes the stone to pos34 first, then to pos24, then to pos14, then to pos13? No, but pos13 is a goal location. Let me check the movement directions.

Stone at pos33. If the agent is at pos43 and pushes the stone to pos34 (dirdown), then the agent is at pos33. Then, agent moves to pos34, pushes the stone to pos44 (dirright), but that's moving away from the goal.

Alternatively, after pushing to pos23, the agent is at pos33. Can the agent move to pos23's south (pos24), then push the stone up? But pos24 is south of pos23. Moving up from pos24 to pos23 (stone's location). Then the stone moves up to pos22. Not helpful.

I think I'm missing something here. Let's re-examine the movement directions again.

The key is that when pushing, the agent moves in direction d to reach the stone's location, and the stone moves in the same direction d. So the direction must be such that both the agent's move and the stone's move are possible in direction d.

For example, in the first push from pos43 to pos33 (dirleft), the stone moves dirleft to pos23. So direction dirleft.

To push from pos23 to pos13, the agent needs to be at a position where moving dirleft leads to pos23, and from pos23, moving dirleft leads to pos13. So the agent must be east of pos23 (pos24) and move dirleft to pos23. Then the stone moves dirleft to pos13. But according to the movement rules, from pos24, moving dirleft is not possible. From pos24, you can move dirleft to pos14. But pos23 is north of pos24. So the direction from pos24 to pos23 is dirup.

Thus, the agent would have to move dirup to pos23, and the stone would move dirup to pos22. Which is not helpful.

So perhaps there's no way to push the stone from pos23 to pos13 directly. Therefore, the initial approach is incorrect.

Alternative plan: find a different path to the stone. Maybe the agent can go around to the west side of the stone and push it east towards pos34, but that moves it away from the goal.

Alternatively, push the stone up from pos33 to pos32, then left to pos22, then up to pos12, then left to pos13.

But how to push from pos33 to pos32. The agent needs to be south of pos33 (pos43) and move north (dirleft) to pos33, then the stone moves north (dirleft) to pos23. Which is what we did before.

Alternatively, agent is at pos32 and pushes the stone south to pos33. No, that's not helpful.

This is really challenging. Let me try to think of the grid layout.

The grid is 5x5:

Rows 1 to 5 (vertical), columns 1 to 5 (horizontal). So pos11 is row 1, column 1; pos13 is row 1, column 3.

Stone is at pos33 (row3, column3). Goal is pos13 (row1, column3).

The agent starts at pos41 (row4, column1).

To push the stone to pos13, need to move it up two times (from row3 to row2 to row1), each time moving north.

But each push requires the agent to be south of the stone and push north. So:

First push: agent is south of pos33 (pos43), pushes north to pos23 (row2, column3).

Second push: agent needs to be south of pos23 (pos33) to push north to pos13. But after the first push, the stone is at pos23, and the agent is at pos33 (south of pos23). So agent can then push the stone from pos23 to pos13 by moving north (dirup) from pos33 to pos23, but wait, pos23 is occupied by the stone. So the agent can't move there. So that's a problem.

Wait, after the first push, the agent is at pos33 (original stone position). The stone is at pos23. So pos33 is now clear. The agent is at pos33. Now, to push the stone from pos23 to pos13, the agent needs to be south of pos23 (pos33) and move north (dirup) to pos23. But pos23 is occupied by the stone. So the agent can't move into the stone's position. Therefore, this is impossible.

This means that after the first push, the agent cannot directly push the stone again to pos13. Therefore, there must be a different approach.

Alternative idea: the agent moves around to the east side of the stone and pushes it west. For example:

Agent starts at pos41 → pos42 → pos43 → pos44. From pos44, move west to pos34. Then, push the stone from pos34 to pos24 (dirup), but that's not helpful.

Alternatively, agent moves from pos41 → pos42 → pos43 → pos33 (dirleft), pushing the stone to pos23. Then, agent is at pos33. Now, agent moves to pos34 (dirdown) → pos44 (dirright) → pos54 (dirdown). Not helpful.

Hmm. I'm really stuck here. Let's try to think of the minimal number of steps. The optimal plan needs to be as short as possible. Maybe there's a way to push the stone directly from pos33 to pos13 in one action. But according to the movement rules, is there a path that allows that?

Looking at the allowed movements from pos33: can the agent push the stone two steps up? No, because each push action moves the stone one step. So two pushes are needed.

But the agent can't get into position to do the second push after the first. Unless there's a way to navigate around.

Wait, after the first push, the agent is at pos33. The stone is at pos23. The agent can move from pos33 to pos32 (dirup). Then to pos22 (dirleft). Then to pos12 (dirleft). Then to pos13 (dirleft). Now, the agent is at pos13, which is a goal location. But the stone is at pos23. The agent can then move to pos23's east side (pos24) and push west. But how?

Agent is at pos13. From there, can move down to pos23 (dirdown). But pos23 is occupied by the stone. So agent can't move there.

Alternatively, agent at pos13 moves down to pos23, but it's blocked. So this doesn't help.

This is very frustrating. Maybe the problem requires more steps than initially apparent. Let's try to outline all necessary steps:

1. Move agent from pos41 to pos42 (dirdown).
2. Move agent from pos42 to pos43 (dirdown).
3. Push stone from pos33 to pos23 (dirleft). Agent now at pos33, stone at pos23.
4. Move agent from pos33 to pos34 (dirdown).
5. Move agent from pos34 to pos24 (dirleft).
6. Move agent from pos24 to pos14 (dirleft).
7. Move agent from pos14 to pos13 (dirleft). Now, agent is at pos13 (goal).
8. Now, agent needs to push the stone from pos23 to pos13. To do this, the agent must be at pos23's east (pos24) and push west. But agent is at pos13. How to get to pos24?

This seems too long and may not work.

Alternative plan:

1. Move agent from pos41 to pos31 (dirleft).
2. Move agent from pos31 to pos21 (dirleft).
3. Move agent from pos21 to pos22 (dirdown).
4. Move agent from pos22 to pos23 (dirdown).
5. Now, agent is at pos23. Stone is at pos33. Can't push from here.

No, this doesn't help.

Another approach: Maybe the agent can push the stone diagonally, but the actions only allow straight-line pushes.

Alternatively, the agent can push the stone to pos34 (south), then to pos44 (south), then to pos54 (south), but that's moving away from the goal.

I think I'm missing something obvious. Let's re-express the problem: the only goal is pos13. The stone is at pos33. The agent needs to push it west twice: from pos33 to pos23, then pos23 to pos13. But the problem is the second push.

After the first push, the agent is at pos33. The stone is at pos23. The agent needs to get to pos23's west side (pos13) to push it west again. But pos13 is the goal and is clear. So the agent can move to pos13.

How?

Agent is at pos33. Moves:

- pos33 → pos32 (dirup)
- pos32 → pos22 (dirleft)
- pos22 → pos12 (dirleft)
- pos12 → pos13 (dirdown). Now, agent is at pos13.

Now, agent is at pos13. Stone is at pos23. Agent can push the stone from pos23 to pos13 by being east of pos23 (pos24) and pushing west. But how to get to pos24.

From pos13, agent can move dirdown to pos23, but it's occupied by the stone. So can't. Instead, agent needs to move to pos14 (dirdown from pos13), then to pos24 (dirdown). Then, from pos24, push the stone at pos23 west to pos13.

But let's check the movement steps:

After agent is at pos13 (step 8):

9. Move agent from pos13 to pos14 (dirdown).
10. Move agent from pos14 to pos24 (dirdown).
11. Push the stone from pos23 to pos13 using pushtogoal. Agent is at pos24, pushes dirup to pos23, then stone moves dirup to pos22. No, that's not right.

Alternatively, from pos24, agent pushes the stone from pos23 to pos13 by moving dirleft. But according to movement rules, moving from pos24 to pos23 is dirup. So direction is dirup. Then stone moves dirup to pos22. Not helpful.

This isn't working. I'm really stuck. Maybe there's a different way. Perhaps the agent can move from pos33 to pos32 to pos22 to pos23 (but that's occupied by the stone).

Alternatively, the agent can move from pos33 to pos34 to pos24 to pos14 to pos13. Then, from pos13, push the stone at pos23 to pos13. But how? The agent is at pos13, and the stone is at pos23. To push it west, the agent needs to be east of the stone, but pos23's east is pos24. So the agent must be at pos24, move west to pos23 (dirleft), and push the stone west to pos13. So:

Agent at pos13 moves dirdown to pos14, then dirdown to pos24. From pos24, move dirup to pos23 (but it's occupied by the stone). So can't. Therefore, this approach fails.

I think I need to accept that this problem requires at least three actions: two moves to get into position, two pushes. But how?

Wait, maybe the optimal plan is:

1. move player1 pos41 pos42 dirdown
2. move player1 pos42 pos43 dirdown
3. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos33 pos23 dirleft
4. move player1 pos33 pos32 dirup
5. move player1 pos32 pos22 dirleft
6. move player1 pos22 pos12 dirleft
7. move player1 pos12 pos13 dirleft
8. move player1 pos13 pos14 dirdown
9. move player1 pos14 pos24 dirdown
10. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos23 pos13 dirup

But step 10: when pushing from pos24 to pos23 (dirup), the stone moves dirup to pos22, not pos13. So this is invalid.

Alternatively, after step 7, the agent is at pos13. Then, move to pos23's east (pos24), but how? From pos13, move dirdown to pos23 (occupied). So no.

I think the correct answer requires two pushes:

1. Move agent to pos43.
2. Push stone to pos23.
3. Move agent around to pos24.
4. Push stone to pos13.

But how to get the agent to pos24 after the first push.

After the first push, agent is at pos33. They need to move to pos34 (dirdown), then to pos24 (dirleft). Then, from pos24, push the stone to pos13.

But how to push from pos24 to pos23 (dirup), then the stone moves dirup to pos22. Not helpful.

Wait, perhaps there's a different direction. Let's check the movement from pos24 to pos23 is dirup. So direction dirup. Then, the stone would move dirup to pos22. Not pos13. So this is not the right direction.

Therefore, it's impossible to push the stone from pos23 to pos13 with the given movement directions.

This implies that the initial approach is wrong, and there's a different path to move the stone to the goal.

Alternative idea: the agent moves east to pos51, then north, but that's longer.

Wait, the agent starts at pos41. Can move dirright to pos51, then up to pos52, etc. Not helpful.

Alternatively, agent moves to pos31, then pos21, pos22, pos23. But the stone is at pos33. No.

I'm stuck. Perhaps the answer requires only two actions, but I can't see how.

Wait, wait! The stone is at pos33. The goal is pos13. Is there a direct path for the agent to push the stone up twice in two actions?

First, agent moves from pos41 to pos42 to pos43. Then pushes the stone from pos33 to pos23. Then, agent is at pos33. Now, agent moves to pos32 (dirup), then to pos22 (dirleft), then to pos12 (dirleft), then to pos13 (dirleft). Then, agent is at pos13. From here, can the agent push the stone from pos23 to pos13? How?

Agent is at pos13. To push the stone from pos23 to pos13, the agent must be at pos23's east (pos24), push west (dirleft). But the agent is at pos13. To get to pos24, agent would need to move down to pos14, then right to pos24. Then, push dirleft to pos23. But pos23 is occupied by the stone, so can't move there. Therefore, agent can push from pos24 to pos23 (dirup), stone moves dirup to pos22. Not helpful.

This is impossible. Therefore, perhaps the problem has no solution, but that's not possible. The problem must have a solution.

Wait, maybe I'm missing a movement option. Let me check the movement from pos23 to pos13. According to the given moves:

"You may move from location pos23 to location pos13 following direction dirleft"

So if the agent can be at pos23's east (pos24), then move dirleft to pos23, then the stone moves dirleft to pos13. But according to the movement rules, from pos24 to pos23 is dirup, not dirleft. So direction would be dirup. Therefore, the stone would move dirup to pos22. Not dirleft.

Therefore, there's no way to push the stone from pos23 to pos13 with a single action. Hence, the problem requires a different approach.

Wait! Another idea: maybe the agent can push the stone diagonally, but the actions only allow straight-line moves. So that's not possible.

Another thought: the initial state says that pos33 is clear. Wait, no. The original state includes:

"Location pos33 is clear" — no, wait, looking back:

The original state lists "Location pos33 is clear" under the initial state. But the stone is at pos33. That's a contradiction. Wait, no. Wait, in the initial state:

The original state says:

"stone1 is at location pos33"

But then later in the original state:

"Location pos33 is clear"

This is a contradiction. Because if a stone is at pos33, then pos33 is not clear. So perhaps this is a mistake in the problem description. Or maybe I'm misreading it.

Looking back at the original state:

The initial state lists:

"player1 is at location pos41"

"stone1 is at location pos33"

Then, under "Location pos11 is clear" ... "Location pos33 is clear" — wait, that's impossible. The stone is at pos33, so pos33 should not be clear. This must be an error in the problem statement.

Assuming that's a mistake and pos33 is not clear (since the stone is there), then the initial state is:

- stone1 is at pos33 (not clear)
- player1 is at pos41 (clear)
- other locations as specified.

But the problem states "Location pos33 is clear" which contradicts the stone's position. This is likely a mistake. However, since the problem states it, perhaps the stone is at pos33 but pos33 is considered clear? That doesn't make sense. This must be a mistake, but I'll proceed with the given information.

Assuming that pos33 is clear despite the stone being there (which is conflicting), the agent can move into pos33. But that's impossible. So this must be a mistake. The correct initial state should have pos33 not clear because the stone is there.

Assuming that's a mistake, and pos33 is not clear (as the stone is there), then the agent's path is as initially planned.

But given the problem's description, I have to work with what's given. According to the original state:

"stone1 is at location pos33"

"Location pos33 is clear"

This is a contradiction. Therefore, there must be an error. But proceeding regardless.

If pos33 is clear, then the agent can move there. But the stone is also there. This is impossible. So perhaps the problem intended that the stone is at pos33, and pos33 is not clear. Therefore, the initial state's "Location pos33 is clear" is a mistake. But since I have to follow the problem as stated, I have to proceed.

Assuming that the stone is at pos33 and pos33 is not clear, the agent can't move there. So the initial plan is correct.

But given the contradiction, perhaps the problem intended that the stone is at pos33 and pos33 is not clear. Therefore, the agent must push the stone from pos33.

So, the correct steps would be:

1. Agent moves from pos41 to pos42 (dirdown).
2. Agent moves from pos42 to pos43 (dirdown).
3. Agent pushes stone1 from pos33 to pos23 (dirleft) using pushtonongoal. Now, stone1 is at pos23 (non-goal), agent is at pos33.
4. Agent moves from pos33 to pos34 (dirdown).
5. Agent moves from pos34 to pos24 (dirleft).
6. Agent pushes stone1 from pos23 to pos13 (dirup) using pushtogoal. Now, stone1 is at pos13 (goal).

But step 6 requires that the agent is at pos24, moves dirup to pos23 (stone's location), then the stone moves dirup to pos22. But we need it to move dirleft to pos13. So this doesn't work.

Alternatively, the direction in step 6 must be dirleft. But how?

Agent is at pos24. To push the stone from pos23 to pos13, the direction must be dirleft. But from pos24, moving dirleft would take the agent to pos14 (dirleft from pos24 is to pos14), not pos23. Therefore, this approach doesn't work.

Given the time I've spent and the lack of progress, I think the correct answer is the initial three steps, but it's missing the second push. However, given the problem's constraints and possible movement options, perhaps there is a way that I'm not seeing. Alternatively, the optimal plan is three steps:

1. move player1 pos41 pos42 dirdown
2. move player1 pos42 pos43 dirdown
3. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos33 pos13 dirleft

But wait, pos33 to pos13 via dirleft is not possible. Because moving dirleft from pos33 would go to pos32, then pos22, etc. No, according to the movement rules, from pos33, dirleft is to pos23. So pushing from pos43 to pos33 (dirleft) moves the stone to pos23. To get to pos13, another push is needed. But as discussed earlier, this is not possible.

Therefore, perhaps the problem requires only three steps, but I can't see how. Maybe the agent can push the stone directly from pos33 to pos13 in one action by using a different direction.

Wait, looking at the allowed moves for the agent to reach pos33 from the west. For example, the agent can move from pos32 to pos33 (dirdown). So if the agent is at pos32, they can push the stone from pos33 to pos34 (dirright). But that's away from the goal.

Alternatively, the agent is at pos23, pushes the stone to pos13. But the agent needs to be at pos23's east (pos24) to push west. But from pos24, moving dirleft would take the agent to pos14, not pos23.

This is really frustrating. I think I have to conclude that the optimal plan is:

1. move player1 pos41 pos42 dirdown
2. move player1 pos42 pos43 dirdown
3. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos33 pos23 dirleft
4. move player1 pos33 pos32 dirup
5. move player1 pos32 pos22 dirleft
6. move player1 pos22 pos12 dirleft
7. move player1 pos12 pos13 dirleft
8. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos13 pos23 pos13 dirleft

But step 8 is invalid because the agent can't push the stone from pos23 to pos13 unless they are east of pos23. But pos13 is west of pos23. The agent is at pos13, which is west of pos23, and can't move east into pos23 (occupied by the stone).

Given that I can't find a valid plan, I must have missed something. Perhaps there's a different path where the agent pushes the stone up to pos32, then left to pos31, etc. But that's moving away from the goal.

Alternatively, the problem's solution requires moving the stone to pos34 first, then to pos44, etc., but that's not helpful.

I'm forced to conclude that the optimal plan is:

```
move player1 pos41 pos42 dirdown
move player1 pos42 pos43 dirdown
pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos33 pos13 dirleft
```

But wait, the direction from pos43 to pos33 is dirleft. Then, the stone moves dirleft from pos33 to pos23. So this action is pushtonongoal, not pushtogoal, because pos23 is not a goal. So step 3 should be pushtonongoal. Then, how to push to pos13.

But given the time I've spent and the lack of a better solution, I think the correct answer involves pushing the stone twice, but due to the constraints, the plan might be longer. However, given the problem's requirement for an optimal plan, perhaps there's a way to push the stone directly to pos13 in one action. But according to the movement rules, that's not possible.

Wait! Let me check the movement from pos33 to pos13. The allowed moves for pos33 include:

"You may move from location pos33 to location pos23 following direction dirleft"

There's no direct move from pos33 to pos13. Therefore, it's impossible to push the stone from pos33 to pos13 in one action. Hence, two pushes are needed.

Therefore, the optimal plan would be:

1. move player1 pos41 pos42 dirdown
2. move player1 pos42 pos43 dirdown
3. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos33 pos23 dirleft
4. move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown
5. move player1 pos34 pos24 dirleft
6. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos24 pos23 pos13 dirup

But step 6 is invalid because dirup from pos23 leads to pos22. However, perhaps there's a different direction. Wait, if the agent is at pos24 and pushes the stone from pos23 to pos13, the direction must be dirleft. But from pos24, moving dirleft would take the agent to pos14, not pos23. Therefore, this isn't possible.

Given all this, I think the correct answer is the following three-step plan, but I'm not sure. However, given the problem's constraints, perhaps there's a mistake in my reasoning.

But the initial push to pos23, then the agent moves around and pushes again. However, without a valid path, I'm unsure. Given the time I've spent, I'll provide the initial three-step plan, even though it doesn't complete the goal, but I must be missing something.
