Let's analyze this problem:

1. We have a 2D grid with positions labeled as posXY, where X and Y are numbers from 1 to 5.
2. We have one agent (player1) starting at pos41.
3. We have one stone (stone1) at pos33.
4. The goal is to move stone1 to a goal location, which is only pos13.

The actions we can take are:
1. Move the agent from one position to another.
2. Push a stone to a goal location.
3. Push a stone to a non-goal location.

To solve this problem, we need to:
1. Move the agent to a position adjacent to the stone.
2. Push the stone towards the goal location (pos13).

Let me start by visualizing the grid:

```
   1  2  3  4  5
1  .  .  G  .  .
2  .  .  .  .  .
3  .  .  S  .  .
4  P  .  .  .  .
5  .  .  .  .  .
```

Where P is the player, S is the stone, G is the goal, and . is an empty space.

Now, the stone is at pos33, and the goal is at pos13. We need to push the stone upwards to reach the goal. To do this, the agent needs to be below the stone (at pos43), and then push the stone up.

Let's plan the steps:
1. The agent needs to move from pos41 to pos43 (i.e., move right two times).
2. Then, the agent needs to move from pos43 to pos33 (upwards) and push the stone to pos23.
3. Next, the agent needs to push the stone from pos23 to pos13 (the goal location).

Let's implement this plan:

1. Move player1 from pos41 to pos42:
   "move player1 pos41 pos42 dirdown"
2. Move player1 from pos42 to pos43:
   "move player1 pos42 pos43 dirdown"
3. Push stone1 from pos33 to pos23 (non-goal):
   "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos33 pos23 dirup"
4. Push stone1 from pos23 to pos13 (goal):
   "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos13 dirup"

Wait, I need to check the preconditions of the push actions more carefully.

For "pushtonongoal":
(i) agent p is at location l_p
(ii) stone s is at location l_from
(iii) location l_to is clear
(iv) you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d
(v) you can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d
(vi) location l_to is not a goal location

So for step 3 ("pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos33 pos23 dirup"), we need to check:
(i) player1 is at pos43 (we will get the player there)
(ii) stone1 is at pos33 (given in the initial state)
(iii) pos23 is clear (needs to be checked in the initial state - it is, since it's listed as clear)
(iv) we can go from pos43 to pos33 following dirup (needs to be checked - it is, since it's listed that "You may move from location pos43 to location pos33 following direction dirleft")
(v) we can go from pos33 to pos23 following dirup (needs to be checked - it is, since it's listed that "You may move from location pos33 to location pos23 following direction dirleft")
(vi) pos23 is not a goal location (needs to be checked - it is, since it's listed as "pos23 is not a goal location")

Actually, there seems to be a discrepancy here. The description mentions directions like dirup, dirdown, dirleft, dirright, but the state uses "following direction dirleft" to describe "You may move from location pos43 to location pos33 following direction dirleft", which seems incorrect based on the grid. 

Let me check the specifications again:
- The 2D grid positions have the form posXY. I presume that X represents the row and Y represents the column.
- In the initial state, player1 is at pos41 and stone1 is at pos33.
- Looking at the allowed moves, "You may move from location pos43 to location pos33 following direction dirleft", I'm now confused about the directions.

Let's reconsider the grid with the given allowed moves:

If we can move from pos43 to pos33 following direction dirleft, then it means:
1. pos43 is to the right of pos33 (since we move left from pos43 to get to pos33).
2. Similarly, if we look at other allowed moves, "You may move from location pos33 to location pos23 following direction dirleft", it implies pos33 is to the right of pos23.

So, the grid might be something like:
```
   1  2  3  4  5
1  .  .  .  .  .
2  .  .  .  .  .
3  .  .  .  .  .
4  .  .  .  .  .
5  .  .  .  .  .
```

And maybe the positions are labeled posXY where X is the column and Y is the row.

Actually, let's try to infer the grid from the allowed moves. Looking at the moves:
"You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright"
"You may move from location pos11 to location pos12 following direction dirdown"

If pos11 is the top-left corner, then pos21 would be to the right of pos11 and pos12 would be below pos11. So the positions might be labeled posXY where X is the column and Y is the row.

Given this, let's reorganize our understanding:

```
   1  2  3  4  5
1  .  .  G  .  .
2  .  .  .  .  .
3  .  .  S  .  .
4  P  .  .  .  .
5  .  .  .  .  .
```

Where pos11 is the top-left, pos55 is the bottom-right, pos41 (where the player is) is in the fourth column and first row, and pos33 (where the stone is) is in the third column and third row.

I'm confused again. Let's check some more allowed moves:
"You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright"
"You may move from location pos11 to location pos12 following direction dirdown"

If dirright means moving to the right and dirdown means moving down, then:
- pos21 is to the right of pos11.
- pos12 is below pos11.

This suggests that posXY means "position in column X and row Y." This makes pos11 the top-left corner, pos15 the bottom-left corner, pos51 the top-right corner, and pos55 the bottom-right corner.

With this in mind, let's redraw the grid:

```
   1  2  3  4  5
1  .  .  .  P  .
2  .  .  .  .  .
3  .  .  S  .  .
4  .  .  .  .  .
5  .  .  .  .  .
```

Hold on, I'm still confused. Let's check the directions again. If pos11 to pos21 is dirright, then dirright is moving from column 1 to column 2, which is moving right. If pos11 to pos12 is dirdown, then dirdown is moving from row 1 to row 2, which is moving down. But this doesn't align with my understanding of the grid.

Let's actually go through the list of allowed moves and visualize the grid.

"You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright"
"You may move from location pos11 to location pos12 following direction dirdown"

If these directions are correct, then pos11 is the top-left corner, pos21 is to the right of pos11, and pos12 is below pos11. This would mean posXY means "position in row X and column Y."

Let's check some more:
"You may move from location pos21 to location pos11 following direction dirleft"
"You may move from location pos21 to location pos31 following direction dirright"
"You may move from location pos21 to location pos22 following direction dirdown"

This confirms that:
- dirleft means moving from right to left (from pos21 to pos11).
- dirright means moving from left to right (from pos21 to pos31).
- dirdown means moving from up to down (from pos21 to pos22).

So, posXY indeed means "position in row X and column Y." With this in mind, let's redraw the grid:

```
   1  2  3  4  5
1  .  .  .  .  .
2  .  .  .  .  .
3  .  .  S  .  .
4  P  .  .  .  .
5  .  .  .  .  .
```

Where:
- pos11 is the top-left.
- pos55 is the bottom-right.
- player1 is at pos41 (fourth row, first column).
- stone1 is at pos33 (third row, third column).
- pos13 (first row, third column) is the goal location.

Alright, now I understand the grid better. 

Let's think of a shorter path to push the stone to the goal:
1. The stone is at pos33 (row 3, column 3).
2. The goal is at pos13 (row 1, column 3).
3. The player is at pos41 (row 4, column 1).

We need to push the stone upwards, so the player needs to be below the stone. The shortest path seems to be:
1. Move player1 from pos41 to pos31 (up).
2. Move player1 from pos31 to pos32 (right).
3. Move player1 from pos32 to pos33 (right). Wait, this can't be right because the stone is already at pos33.

I'm not sure if I'm still understanding the grid correctly. Let's try again with a different approach.

If stone1 is at pos33 (third row, third column), and the player is at pos41 (fourth row, first column), let's check if there's an allowed move from pos41 to pos31:
"You may move from location pos41 to location pos31 following direction dirleft"

But that doesn't make sense if pos31 is above pos41. Let's check another move:
"You may move from location pos41 to location pos51 following direction dirright"

Again, pos51 being to the right of pos41 doesn't align with my understanding.

Ok, let's recalibrate. I've been confusing myself. I think a cleaner way to think about this is to consider the first number in posXY as the row and the second number as the column. So, pos41 would mean "row 4, column 1."

With this, the grid would look like:

```
   1  2  3  4  5
1  .  .  G  .  .
2  .  .  .  .  .
3  .  .  S  .  .
4  P  .  .  .  .
5  .  .  .  .  .
```

Where:
- pos41 (row 4, column 1) is where the player is.
- pos33 (row 3, column 3) is where the stone is.
- pos13 (row 1, column 3) is the goal.

Now, let's check if the allowed moves align with this:

"You may move from location pos41 to location pos31 following direction dirleft"
This doesn't make sense. Moving from pos41 to pos31 should be moving upward, not left.

Let me try again but this time assuming posXY means "position in column X, row Y."

With this, the grid would look like:

```
   1  2  3  4  5
1  .  .  .  P  .
2  .  .  .  .  .
3  .  .  S  .  .
4  .  .  .  .  .
5  .  .  .  .  .
```

Let's check if the allowed moves align with this:

"You may move from location pos41 to location pos31 following direction dirleft"
This would mean moving from column 4, row 1 to column 3, row 1, which is moving left. This aligns with the direction dirleft.

"You may move from location pos41 to location pos51 following direction dirright"
This would mean moving from column 4, row 1 to column 5, row 1, which is moving right. This aligns with the direction dirright.

"You may move from location pos41 to location pos42 following direction dirdown"
This would mean moving from column 4, row 1 to column 4, row 2, which is moving down. This aligns with the direction dirdown.

Great! I think this interpretation is correct: posXY means "position in column X, row Y."

Ah, wait a minute. I'm confusing myself again. It's the opposite of what I just said; it's row then column. Here's the evidence:

If "You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright" is true, then pos21 means "row 2, column 1", not "column 2, row 1", otherwise, the direction would be dirdown, not dirright.

Let's settle on this: posXY means "position in row X, column Y". The grid would then look like:

```
   1  2  3  4  5
1  .  .  G  .  .
2  .  .  .  .  .
3  .  .  S  .  .
4  P  .  .  .  .
5  .  .  .  .  .
```

Now, let's verify some allowed moves:

"You may move from location pos41 to location pos31 following direction dirleft"
This would mean moving from row 4, column 1 to row 3, column 1, which would be moving upward, not left. This is a contradiction.

Ok, I'm going in circles. Let's stop and take a systematic approach.

Let's denote the positions on the grid as (row, column). The allowed moves are:

"You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright"
This means from (1,1) to (2,1) is a move in the dirright direction.

"You may move from location pos11 to location pos12 following direction dirdown"
This means from (1,1) to (1,2) is a move in the dirdown direction.

Given these two, I think the format is indeed posXY where X is the row and Y is the column. But this contradicts the direction names.

Let's try a different approach. Given that the player is at pos41 and the stone is at pos33, and the goal is at pos13, we can deduce the grid structure based on the plan we need to create.

To push the stone from pos33 to pos13 (the goal), the stone needs to move "upward" or "leftward" (depending on the orientation of the grid). The player needs to be on the opposite side of the direction to push the stone.

Let's check if there are allowed moves from pos41 to reach a position adjacent to pos33:

"You may move from location pos41 to location pos31 following direction dirleft"
"You may move from location pos41 to location pos51 following direction dirright"
"You may move from location pos41 to location pos42 following direction dirdown"

Assuming posXY means "row X, column Y", these moves don't align with a grid where the player is at row 4, column 1 and the stone is at row 3, column 3.

Let's look at more allowed moves for pos33:

"You may move from location pos33 to location pos23 following direction dirleft"
"You may move from location pos33 to location pos43 following direction dirright"
"You may move from location pos33 to location pos32 following direction dirup"
"You may move from location pos33 to location pos34 following direction dirdown"

I'm now thinking that the directions like dirleft, dirright, dirup, and dirdown are not actually related to left, right, up, and down in the traditional sense.

Wait a minute. I misread the allowed moves. The allowed move is:
"You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright"

This means from pos11 to pos21 is a move in the dirright direction. It doesn't necessarily mean pos21 is to the right of pos11 in a Cartesian grid.

Let's check how the positions are interconnected based on the allowed moves.

"You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright"
"You may move from location pos11 to location pos12 following direction dirdown"

If we consider a 5x5 grid with positions labeled from pos11 (top-left) to pos55 (bottom-right), then:
- pos21 would be the position to the right of pos11.
- pos12 would be the position below pos11.

This would mean posXY means "position in row X, column Y". The grid would look like:

```
   1  2  3  4  5
1  11 21 31 41 51
2  12 22 32 42 52
3  13 23 33 43 53
4  14 24 34 44 54
5  15 25 35 45 55
```

With this, player1 is at pos41 (row 1, column 4), stone1 is at pos33 (row 3, column 3), and the goal is at pos13 (row 3, column 1).

But, this once again contradicts the directions in the allowed moves.

Let me try one more approach. Let's forget about the grid orientation and just think of the positions as nodes in a graph. The allowed moves give us the edges between these nodes.

Given that player1 is at pos41, stone1 is at pos33, and the goal is at pos13, I want to find a path from pos41 to a position adjacent to pos33, push the stone in the direction of pos13, and continue pushing until the stone reaches pos13.

First, let's determine if there's a direct connection from pos41 to a position adjacent to pos33. Looking at the allowed moves:
"You may move from location pos33 to location pos23 following direction dirleft"
"You may move from location pos33 to location pos43 following direction dirright"
"You may move from location pos33 to location pos32 following direction dirup"
"You may move from location pos33 to location pos34 following direction dirdown"

So, the positions adjacent to pos33 are pos23, pos43, pos32, and pos34. Let's check if player1 can directly go from pos41 to any of these:

"You may move from location pos41 to location pos31 following direction dirleft"
"You may move from location pos41 to location pos51 following direction dirright"
"You may move from location pos41 to location pos42 following direction dirdown"

None of pos23, pos43, pos32, or pos34 are directly connected to pos41. We need to find a path from pos41 to one of these positions.

Let's trace a path from pos41 to pos43:
pos41 -> pos31 (dirleft) -> pos32 (dirdown) -> pos33 (dirdown) -> pos43 (dirright)

Wait, we can't go from pos33 to pos43 if the stone is at pos33. We'd need to push the stone first.

Let's reconsider the grid:

```
   1  2  3  4  5
1  .  .  .  P  .
2  .  .  .  .  .
3  G  .  S  .  .
4  .  .  .  .  .
5  .  .  .  .  .
```

If player1 is at row 1, column 4 (pos41) and stone1 is at row 3, column 3 (pos33), the player needs to move to a position adjacent to the stone, say row 3, column 2 (pos32), and push the stone in the direction of the goal, which is row 3, column 1 (pos13).

Let me trace a path from pos41 to pos32:
pos41 -> pos31 (dirleft) -> pos32 (dirdown)

This looks plausible. Once the player is at pos32, they can push the stone from pos33 to pos23 (assuming the directions are consistent with my grid orientation), and then from pos23 to pos13.

Alright, let me summarize and provide a plan:

1. Move player1 from pos41 to pos31:
   "move player1 pos41 pos31 dirleft"
2. Move player1 from pos31 to pos32:
   "move player1 pos31 pos32 dirdown"
3. Push stone1 from pos33 to pos23 (non-goal):
   "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos33 pos23 dirleft"
4. Push stone1 from pos23 to pos13 (goal):
   "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos23 pos13 dirleft"

But there's a potential issue with the 4th step. The action is "pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d", but I've duplicated the position l_p and l_from. Let me check the proper format again...

For "pushtogoal", the format is:
"pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": Agent p, situated at location l_p, pushes stone s from location l_from to goal location l_to, following direction d.

So, the correct form for the 4th step would be:
"pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos23 pos13 dirleft"

No wait, that's still wrong. The player will be at pos23 (after the stone has been moved from pos33 to pos23), and the stone is now at pos23 as well. The player needs to push the stone from pos23 to pos13.

So the action should be:
"pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos23 pos23 pos13 dirleft"

Well, I'm making a mistake. After the third action, the player will be at pos33 (not pos23) and the stone will be at pos23. So the 4th action should be:
"pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos23 pos13 dirleft"

Let's validate the entire plan:

1. Move player1 from pos41 to pos31:
   "move player1 pos41 pos31 dirleft"
2. Move player1 from pos31 to pos32:
   "move player1 pos31 pos32 dirdown"
3. Push stone1 from pos33 to pos23 (non-goal):
   "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos33 pos23 dirleft"
4. Push stone1 from pos23 to pos13 (goal):
   "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos23 pos13 dirleft"

But there's still a potential issue. From the effects of "pushtonongoal", it says:
"(iv) agent p is at location l_from, (v) stone s is at location l_to"

So, after the 3rd action, player1 will be at pos33 and stone1 will be at pos23. But then, the 4th action says player1 is pushing the stone from pos33. This doesn't seem right, as the player needs to be adjacent to the stone to push it.

Let me check the effects of "pushtonongoal" again...

Ah, I see. After the 3rd action:
"pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos33 pos23 dirleft"

The effects would be (based on the given effects for "pushtonongoal"):
- player1 is no longer at pos32
- stone1 is no longer at pos33
- pos23 is no longer clear
- player1 is at pos33
- stone1 is at pos23
- pos32 is clear
- stone1 is at a non-goal state

So player1 would be at pos33 and stone1 would be at pos23. This means the player is adjacent to the stone, but in the wrong direction. The player needs to be at pos13 (dirleft of pos23) to push the stone in that direction.

I need to adjust the plan. After pushing the stone to pos23, the player needs to move to a position from which they can push the stone to pos13.

Let's trace the path:
1. Move player1 from pos41 to pos31 (dirleft)
2. Move player1 from pos31 to pos32 (dirdown)
3. Push stone1 from pos33 to pos23 (dirleft)
4. Move player1 from pos33 to pos43 (dirright)
5. Move player1 from pos43 to pos33 (dirleft)
6. Move player1 from pos33 to pos32 (dirup)
7. Move player1 from pos32 to pos22 (dirup)
8. Move player1 from pos22 to pos23 (dirdown)
9. Move player1 from pos23 to pos13 (dirup)
10. Push stone1 from pos23 to pos13 (dirleft)

Wait, I messed up the coordinates again. Let me think of this in terms of moving from one box to an adjacent box without assuming the orientation of the grid:

1. Player is at pos41.
2. Stone is at pos33.
3. Goal is at pos13.

By checking the allowed moves, I can see that from pos41, we can move to pos31, pos51, or pos42. From these, I'll choose pos31, as it seems to bring the player closer to the stone.

From pos31, we can go to pos32, which is adjacent to pos33 where the stone is.

Now, I need to push the stone from pos33 to a position closer to the goal (pos13). The allowed moves for pos33 indicate that we can go from pos33 to pos23, pos43, pos32, or pos34. Since pos13 is our goal, moving the stone to pos23 seems to be in the right direction.

After pushing the stone from pos33 to pos23, player1 will be at pos33 and stone1 will be at pos23.

Now, to get the stone from pos23 to pos13, player1 needs to be on the opposite side. The allowed moves for pos23 are: pos13, pos33, pos22, pos24. So, player1 needs to be at pos13 to push the stone.

To get to pos13, player1 can move from pos33 to pos23 (but the stone is there) or to another position that allows them to navigate around the stone. The allowed moves suggest going to pos32, then to pos22, and then to pos12, and finally to pos13.

Let's trace the path:
1. Player1 is at pos41.
2. Move to pos31 (dirleft).
3. Move to pos32 (dirdown).
4. Push stone1 from pos33 to pos23 (dirleft).
5. Move to pos32 (dirup). (Actually, the player will be at pos33 after pushing the stone, so move to pos32 would be dirup, not dirdown).
6. Move to pos22 (dirup).
7. Move to pos12 (dirup).
8. Move to pos13 (dirdown).
9. Push stone1 from pos23 to pos13 (dirup).

Let's validate this sequence with the given allowed moves:

"You may move from location pos41 to location pos31 following direction dirleft" - Step 2 is valid.
"You may move from location pos31 to location pos32 following direction dirdown" - Step 3 is valid.
"You may move from location pos33 to location pos23 following direction dirleft" - The push in Step 4 is valid.
"You may move from location pos33 to location pos32 following direction dirup" - Step 5 is valid.
"You may move from location pos32 to location pos22 following direction dirup" - Step 6 is valid.
"You may move from location pos22 to location pos12 following direction dirup" - Step 7 is valid.
"You may move from location pos12 to location pos13 following direction dirdown" - Step 8 is valid.
"You may move from location pos13 to location pos23 following direction dirdown" - The push in Step 9 is valid but in the opposite direction (dirup).

So, the push in Step 9 isn't valid as I described it. Let me check the allowed moves for pos23 again:
"You may move from location pos23 to location pos13 following direction dirleft"

So, the correct direction for Step 9 is dirleft:
9. Push stone1 from pos23 to pos13 (dirleft).

Here's the adjusted sequence:
1. Player1 is at pos41.
2. Move to pos31 (dirleft).
3. Move to pos32 (dirdown).
4. Push stone1 from pos33 to pos23 (dirleft).
5. Move to pos32 (dirup).
6. Move to pos22 (dirup).
7. Move to pos12 (dirup).
8. Move to pos13 (dirdown).
9. Push stone1 from pos23 to pos13 (dirleft).

But actually, there's still a problem. In Step 9, the player is at pos13 and the stone is at pos23. According to the action description:
"pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d": You may only perform this action if (i) agent p is at location l_p, (ii) stone s is at location l_from, (iii) location l_to is clear, (iv) you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d, (v) you can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d, and (vi) location l_to is a goal location.

The player needs to be able to get from l_p to l_from following direction d. But from pos13 to pos23, the direction would be dirdown (based on the allowed moves), not dirleft.

I need to rethink this. Let's visualize the grid again: (note that the number we're talking about (posXY) is confusing, so I'll add the actual posXY number followed by a letter grid)

```
    dirright/dirleft ->

So, player1 is at pos41 (A4), stone1 is at pos33 (C3), and the goal is at pos13 (C1).

Based on the allowed moves, here's the plan:
1. Move player1 from pos41 (A4) to pos31 (A3) following dirleft.
2. Move player1 from pos31 (A3) to pos32 (B3) following dirdown.
3. Push stone1 from pos33 (C3) to pos23 (C2) following dirleft. After this, player1 will be at pos33 (C3).
4. Move player1 from pos33 (C3) to pos23 (C2) following dirleft.
5. Push stone1 from pos23 (C2) to pos13 (C1) following dirleft. After this, player1 will be at pos23 (C2) and stone1 will be at pos13 (C1).

Wait, there's a potential issue with step 4. It says player1 moves from pos33 to pos23, but after step 3, the stone is at pos23, so player1 can't move there (since the location is not clear).

I'll correct the plan:
1. Move player1 from pos41 (A4) to pos31 (A3) following dirleft.
2. Move player1 from pos31 (A3) to pos32 (B3) following dirdown.
3. Push stone1 from pos33 (C3) to pos23 (C2) following dirleft. After this, player1 will be at pos33 (C3) and stone1 will be at pos23 (C2).
4. Move player1 from pos33 (C3) to pos34 (D3) following dirdown.
5. Move player1 from pos34 (D3) to pos24 (D2) following dirleft.
6. Move player1 from pos24 (D2) to pos14 (D1) following dirleft.
7. Move player1 from pos14 (D1) to pos13 (C1) following dirup.
8. Push stone1 from pos23 (C2) to pos13 (C1) following dirleft. After this, player1 will be at pos23 (C2) and stone1 will be at pos13 (C1).

Let me check the allowed moves for each transition:

"You may move from location pos41 to location pos31 following direction dirleft" - Step 1 is valid.
"You may move from location pos31 to location pos32 following direction dirdown" - Step 2 is valid.
"You may move from location pos32 to location pos33 following direction dirdown" - The push in Step 3 is valid.
"You may move from location pos33 to location pos34 following direction dirdown" - Step 4 is valid.
"You may move from location pos34 to location pos24 following direction dirleft" - Step 5 is valid.
"You may move from location pos24 to location pos14 following direction dirleft" - Step 6 is valid.
"You may move from location pos14 to location pos13 following direction dirup" - Step 7 is valid.
"You may move from location pos13 to location pos23 following direction dirdown" - The push in Step 8 is valid.

Wait, there's a problem again with step 8. It says to push stone1 from pos23 to pos13 following dirleft, but the allowed move for this transition is dirdown (from pos13 to pos23), not dirleft.

Let me re-examine the push action format:
"pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d"

For a push from pos23 to pos13, player1 should be in a position such that it can get to pos23 following direction d, and pos13 can be reached from pos23 following the same direction d.

Let's check the allowed moves for pos23:
"You may move from location pos23 to location pos13 following direction dirleft"

So, to push the stone from pos23 to pos13, player1 needs to be at a position such that it can get to pos23 following dirleft. This would be pos33. But after step 3, we moved player1 to pos34. We need to adjust our plan.

After pushing the stone to pos23, player1 will be at pos33. To push the stone from pos23 to pos13, player1 needs to move to a position from which it can move to pos23 following dirleft. This would be pos33.

So, the plan should be:
1. Move player1 from pos41 (A4) to pos31 (A3) following dirleft.
2. Move player1 from pos31 (A3) to pos32 (B3) following dirdown.
3. Push stone1 from pos33 (C3) to pos23 (C2) following dirleft. After this, player1 will be at pos33 (C3) and stone1 will be at pos23 (C2).
4. Push stone1 from pos23 (C2) to pos13 (C1) following dirleft. After this, player1 will be at pos23 (C2) and stone1 will be at pos13 (C1).

Alright, this looks correct! Let's validate each step again:
"You may move from location pos41 to location pos31 following direction dirleft" - Step 1 is valid.
"You may move from location pos31 to location pos32 following direction dirdown" - Step 2 is valid.
"You may move from location pos32 to location pos33 following direction dirdown" - The push in Step 3 is valid.
"You may move from location pos33 to location pos23 following direction dirleft" - The push in Step 4 is valid.

Let me now provide the details of each action:

1. "move player1 pos41 pos31 dirleft"
2. "move player1 pos31 pos32 dirdown"
3. "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos33 pos23 dirleft"
4. "pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos23 pos13 dirleft"
