Okay, let me try to figure out how to solve this planning problem. The goal is to get stone1 to a goal location. From the initial state, I know that the only goal location is pos54. So the stone needs to end up there. 

First, looking at where everything is. The agent (player1) starts at pos44. The stone1 is at pos42. The goal location is pos54. So I need to move the stone from pos42 to pos54. 

But how can the agent push the stone there? Let's see the possible paths. Let's consider the grid layout. The positions are named posXY where X is the row and Y is the column. So pos44 is row 4, column 4. Pos42 is row4, column2. Pos54 is row5, column4. Wait, but rows might be numbered upwards. Let me check the movement directions.

Looking at the allowed movements from pos44: It can move to pos34 (dirleft), pos54 (dirright), pos43 (dirup), or pos45 (dirdown). Wait, direction dirright might mean moving to the next column, so maybe the grid is structured such that moving right increases the second number. For example, pos44 to pos54 is dirright. So pos54 is directly to the right of pos44.

But the stone is at pos42. So the agent needs to get to a position adjacent to the stone to push it. The stone is at pos42. The possible directions for pushing: to push the stone, the agent must be in a position that allows moving towards the stone and then pushing it further. Let's see the allowed movements around pos42.

Looking at pos42's connections: From pos42, you can move to pos32 (dirleft), pos52 (dirright), pos41 (dirup), or pos43 (dirdown). Wait, but pos42 is in row4, column2. So moving up (dirup) would be to pos41 (row4, column1? No, maybe the rows are vertical. Wait, maybe the positions are arranged in a grid where the first number is the row (vertical) and the second is the column (horizontal). So pos44 is row4, column4. Moving right (dirright) would increase the column number. Wait, but in the movement from pos44 to pos54 via dirright, that's moving from row4 to row5, so maybe dirright is moving down a row? That seems odd. Wait, maybe the directions are a bit different. Let me check some movement examples.

For example, pos11 can move to pos21 following dirright. pos11 is row1, column1. pos21 is row2, column1. So dirright here moves down a row. Similarly, pos11 can move to pos12 via dirdown, which would be increasing the column. So direction down is moving right in columns. Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me re-express:

The movement directions:

- dirright: moves to the next row (down) same column? Because pos11 to pos21 is dirright. So dirright is moving down a row. dirleft would be moving up a row.

Wait, maybe the directions are as follows:

- dirup: move up a column (same row, column decreases)
- dirdown: move down a column (same row, column increases)
- dirleft: move left a row (row decreases, same column)
- dirright: move right a row (row increases, same column)

Wait, maybe not. Let's take another example: pos12 to pos22 via dirright. pos12 is row1, column2. pos22 is row2, column2. So dirright here moves down a row. So dirright and dirleft are moving along the row (changing the first number), while dirup and dirdown are moving along the column (changing the second number). For example, moving from pos12 to pos13 is dirdown (column increases from 2 to 3), and to pos11 is dirup (column decreases). So:

- dirright: increases row number (downwards)
- dirleft: decreases row number (upwards)
- dirdown: increases column number (rightwards)
- dirup: decreases column number (leftwards)

So the directions are a bit counterintuitive. So, for example, pos44 (row4, column4) moving dirright would go to pos54 (row5, column4). Moving dirleft would go to pos34. Moving dirdown would go to column5 (pos45), and dirup to column3 (pos43).

Given that, the stone is at pos42 (row4, column2). The agent is at pos44 (row4, column4). To push the stone to pos54 (row5, column4), which is a goal location.

Wait, pos54 is row5, column4. So the agent needs to push the stone from pos42 to pos54. Let's see the path.

First, the agent needs to get to a position adjacent to the stone to push it. The stone is at pos42. So the agent must be in a position that can push the stone towards the goal. Let's see possible paths.

The stone is at pos42. The possible directions the agent can push it:

Looking at the allowed movements from pos42: From pos42, the agent can push the stone in directions where the stone can move. For example, if the agent is at pos43 (same row, column3) and pushes the stone to pos44 (same row, column4) via dirdown (since dirdown increases column). Wait, but pos42 is column2. If the agent is at pos43, and wants to push the stone at pos42, that would require the agent to be to the right (column3) of the stone (column2), so pushing left (dirleft) would move the stone to column1? Or maybe not. Wait, the movement directions are a bit tricky.

Alternatively, the agent must be in a position adjacent to the stone in a direction that allows pushing. Let's think in terms of the preconditions for the push actions.

For "pushtogoal" action, the agent must be at l_p, the stone is at l_from, and the agent can move from l_p to l_from via direction d. Then, the stone moves from l_from to l_to via the same direction d. Also, l_to must be a goal location.

So the agent needs to be at a position adjacent to the stone in a direction that allows moving to the stone's position (l_from). Then, pushing the stone in that direction towards l_to, which is a goal.

So, the agent is at pos44. The stone is at pos42. The agent needs to get adjacent to pos42. Let's see possible paths.

From pos44, the agent can move to pos43 (dirup, which decreases column from 4 to 3). Then, from pos43, can they move to pos42 via dirup again? Let's check the allowed movements.

Looking at the movement from pos43: The allowed movements are to pos33 (dirleft, row3), pos53 (dirright, row5?), or to pos42 (dirup, column2). Wait, no. Let me check the given movement possibilities.

Looking at the list of allowed movements:

Looking for "You may move from location pos43 to location pos42 following direction dirup". Yes: "You may move from location pos43 to location pos42 following direction dirup". So from pos43 (row4, column3), dirup would take the agent to pos42 (row4, column2). Wait, but dirup is supposed to decrease the column number. pos43's column is 3, so dirup would go to column2 (pos42). So yes, moving from pos43 to pos42 via dirup.

So the agent could move from pos44 to pos43 (dirup), then from pos43 to pos42 (dirup). But pos42 is where the stone is. Wait, but initially, pos42 is clear (from the original state: "Location pos42 is clear"). Wait, no: the original state says "stone1 is at location pos42" and "Location pos42 is clear". Wait, that's a contradiction. Wait, no. The initial state lists "stone1 is at location pos42" and "Location pos42 is clear". But if the stone is there, the location shouldn't be clear. That must be a mistake. Wait, let me check the original state again.

Looking at the original state:

The original state includes:

- "player1 is at location pos44"

- "stone1 is at location pos42"

- Then a list of locations that are clear. It says "Location pos42 is clear". But if the stone is at pos42, then that location should not be clear. This is a problem. Wait, perhaps there's an error in the problem description. Because if a stone is at pos42, then pos42 is not clear. But the problem states that "Location pos42 is clear". That's conflicting.

Wait, maybe the problem has a typo. Let me check again. The original state's clear locations include:

"Location pos42 is clear"

But the stone1 is at pos42. So that's a contradiction. Because if a stone is at a location, that location is not clear. Unless "clear" here means that there's no agent or stone? Or perhaps the initial state has a mistake. This is critical because if pos42 is clear, then the stone isn't there. But according to the problem, stone1 is at pos42, and pos42 is clear. That can't be.

Wait, maybe "clear" refers to the agent not being present. Because stones are objects that occupy locations, so if a stone is at pos42, then that location is not clear (since it's occupied by the stone). But according to the original state, "stone1 is at location pos42" and "Location pos42 is clear". This is conflicting. That suggests that there's an error in the problem setup, but since we have to work with what's given, perhaps we need to proceed under the assumption that the stone is at pos42, and pos42 is not clear, but the problem states it is. But that's impossible. Wait, perhaps "clear" here means that the agent is not present, but stones can be present. Wait, let's check the action preconditions.

Looking at the preconditions for "move": the agent can move to a location that is clear. The move action requires that the target location is clear. So "clear" in this context means that neither the agent nor a stone is present. Therefore, if a stone is at pos42, pos42 is not clear. So the initial state as given is contradictory. But according to the problem statement, the initial state says:

"stone1 is at location pos42"

"Location pos42 is clear"

This is a contradiction. Therefore, there's a mistake here. But since we have to proceed, perhaps it's a typo, and pos42 is not clear. Let's assume that the initial state actually has stone1 at pos42 and that pos42 is not clear, but the problem statement mistakenly says it's clear. Alternatively, maybe "clear" refers to the agent's presence. But according to the problem's actions, when the agent moves to a location, it must be clear, meaning neither agent nor stone is there.

In the move action's preconditions: "location l_to is clear". So if the stone is at pos42, then pos42 is not clear. Therefore, the initial state has a mistake. But given that the user has provided this, how to resolve it? The problem says that the original state includes "stone1 is at location pos42" and "Location pos42 is clear". That's conflicting. So perhaps this is a mistake, but we have to proceed as if pos42 is occupied by the stone and not clear. Therefore, the "Location pos42 is clear" in the original state is a mistake, and the actual state is that pos42 is not clear because the stone is there. Otherwise, the problem is unsolvable because the stone is not present.

Alternatively, maybe the problem uses "clear" to mean that the agent is not there, but stones can be present. Let's check the effects of actions. For example, when moving, after moving, the agent is at l_to, which is no longer clear. So "clear" refers to the presence of the agent. But if that's the case, then a location can have a stone and be considered clear for movement. But according to the move preconditions, "location l_to is clear" — which would allow the agent to move to a location that has a stone? That can't be. Because if a stone is there, the agent can't move there. So "clear" must mean that neither agent nor stone is present.

Therefore, there's an error in the problem's initial state. But given that the user has provided this, perhaps it's a typo, and "Location pos42 is clear" should be "Location pos42 is not clear". But since I have to work with the given information, I need to proceed.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is correct, and the stone is at pos42, and pos42 is clear. But that's impossible. Therefore, I think the correct initial state is that the stone is at pos42, making pos42 not clear, and the problem statement's mention of pos42 being clear is a mistake. So when solving, I'll proceed under the assumption that pos42 is occupied by the stone and thus not clear, ignoring the conflicting statement. Otherwise, the problem is inconsistent and unsolvable.

So, assuming that pos42 has the stone and is not clear, the agent is at pos44. The agent needs to reach a position adjacent to the stone to push it towards the goal pos54.

Possible path for the agent:

From pos44, the agent can move left (dirleft) to pos34, then up (dirup?) Wait, directions are a bit confusing. Let me think again.

Agent is at pos44 (row4, column4). To reach pos42 (row4, column2), which is two columns to the left (since column decreases from 4 to 2). The directions for moving left in column would be dirup (since dirup decreases column). So from pos44, moving dirup would go to pos43 (column3). Then from pos43, moving dirup again to pos42 (column2). But if pos42 is occupied by the stone, the agent cannot move there. So the agent can't move directly to pos42. Therefore, the agent must move to a position adjacent to the stone to push it.

The stone is at pos42. To push it towards the goal pos54, which is in row5, column4. So the stone needs to move from row4, column2 to row5, column4. That requires moving right (dirright) in row direction and down (dirdown) in column direction. But how can the agent push it in that direction?

Alternatively, perhaps the stone needs to be pushed first to pos43, then to pos44, then to pos54. Let's see.

Wait, pos54 is a goal location. So the stone can be pushed directly to pos54 if possible. Let's see if there's a path.

The agent can push the stone from pos42 to pos43 (dirdown direction, increasing column), then from pos43 to pos44, then from pos44 to pos54 (dirright direction). But each push requires the agent to be in the correct position.

Alternatively, maybe the agent can push the stone in a diagonal direction, but according to the allowed actions, pushing is only along the grid directions. So each push is in a straight line.

Let me outline the steps:

1. The agent needs to get to a position where they can push the stone towards pos54.

The stone is at pos42. To push it to the right (dirright) would take it to pos52 (since moving dirright from pos42 is row5, column2. But pos52 is not a goal. Alternatively, pushing the stone upwards (dirup) to pos32 (column1?), but that's not helpful. Wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, when pushing, the direction refers to the direction from the agent's position to the stone's position, and then the stone moves in the same direction. For example, if the agent is at pos43 (row4, column3) and the stone is at pos42 (row4, column2), then the direction from agent to stone is dirleft (since column3 to column2 is dirup? Wait, no. Wait, dirup is column decrease. So from pos43 to pos42 is dirup. Then, pushing the stone in dirup would take it to pos41 (column1). But pos41 is not a goal. Alternatively, the agent is at pos32 (row3, column2), and pushes the stone to pos42's direction.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to find a path where the agent can push the stone towards pos54. Let's think about the positions.

The stone needs to go to pos54. From pos42, the path to pos54 would require moving right (dirright) twice (from row4 to row5, then row5 to row6? But row5 is the maximum. Wait, pos54 is row5, column4. So pos54 is in row5. So to get from pos42 (row4, column2) to pos54 (row5, column4), the stone needs to move right (dirright) once to pos52 (row5, column2), then dirright again? Wait, no. Wait, row4 to row5 is dirright. Then column2 to column4 is dirdown twice.

But the stone can only be pushed in a straight line in one direction per action. So each push action moves the stone one step in a direction.

Alternatively, the agent can push the stone from pos42 to pos43 (dirdown, increasing column from 2 to3), then to pos44 (dirdown to column4), then push dirright to pos54 (from pos44, pushing dirright would take the stone to row5, column4, which is pos54).

So the steps would be:

1. Agent moves to pos43 (from pos44, move dirup to pos43).

2. Agent pushes the stone from pos42 to pos43 using pushtonongoal (since pos43 is not a goal). Wait, but pos43 is not a goal, so pushtonongoal action is needed here.

Wait, no. The stone is at pos42. Agent is at pos43. To push the stone from pos42 to pos43, but the direction from agent's position (pos43) to stone's position (pos42) is dirup (since moving from pos43 to pos42 is dirup). Then, pushing the stone in the same direction (dirup) would take it to pos41, which is not desired. That's not helpful.

Wait, I think I'm getting confused with directions. Let's clarify:

The agent must be at a location l_p, and the stone is at l_from. The direction d must be the direction from l_p to l_from. Then, the stone moves from l_from to l_to, which is in the same direction d. So for example, if the agent is at pos43 (row4, column3), and the stone is at pos42 (row4, column2), the direction from pos43 to pos42 is dirup (since column decreases from 3 to 2). So the agent can perform a push action where they are at pos43, pushing the stone from pos42 in direction dirup, which would move the stone to pos41. But pos41 is not a goal, so that's not helpful.

Alternatively, if the agent is at pos32 (row3, column2), then the stone is at pos42 (row4, column2). The direction from pos32 to pos42 is dirright (row increases from 3 to 4). So the agent could push the stone from pos42 in dirright direction to pos52 (row5, column2), which is not a goal. But pos52 is not a goal. Then, pushing again from pos52 to pos62 (which doesn't exist). Not useful.

Alternatively, the agent needs to push the stone east (dirdown) to increase the column number. For example, if the agent is at pos42's west (pos43?), wait, no. Let's think:

To push the stone east (column increases), the agent must be to the west of the stone (lower column). So if the stone is at pos42 (column2), the agent needs to be at pos43 (column3) and push east? No. Wait, no. If the agent is to the west of the stone, that would be column1. Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me try a different approach. Let's outline the possible movements for the stone:

From pos42, possible pushes:

- North (dirleft, decreasing row): from pos42 to pos32. But pos32 is not a goal.

- South (dirright, increasing row): pos42 to pos52. Not a goal.

- East (dirdown, increasing column): pos42 to pos43. pos43 is not a goal.

- West (dirup, decreasing column): pos42 to pos41. Not a goal.

So the only way to get the stone to a goal location is to push it south (dirright) to pos52, then east (dirdown) to pos53, etc., but pos54 is the only goal. Alternatively, the stone must be pushed dirright (south) to pos52, then dirright again to pos62 (which doesn't exist). Not possible. So that path doesn't work.

Alternatively, the agent must push the stone east to pos43, then east to pos44, then south (dirright) to pos54.

Let's see:

First, push the stone from pos42 to pos43 (east, dirdown). For that, the agent must be at pos42's west (pos41) or north (pos32) or south (pos52) or east (pos43). Wait, to push east (dirdown), the agent must be to the west of the stone (same row, lower column). So the agent must be at pos41 (row4, column1), which is clear. But how does the agent get there?

Wait, the agent is at pos44. To get to pos41, the path would be: pos44 → pos43 (dirup), pos43 → pos42 (dirup), but pos42 is occupied by the stone. So that's not possible. Alternatively, the agent can move up in rows (dirleft) to pos34, then move west in columns (dirup) to pos33, etc. But this seems complicated.

Alternatively, the agent can move to pos34 (dirleft from pos44), then pos24, etc., but that's moving away from the stone.

Alternatively, the agent can move to pos45 (dirdown from pos44), then pos55 (dirright), but that's not helpful.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let's think of a different approach.

The goal is to push the stone to pos54. pos54 is in row5, column4. The stone is at pos42 (row4, column2). So the stone needs to move two steps south (dirright) to row5, and two steps east (dirdown) to column4. So the path would require pushing the stone south twice and east twice. But how to achieve that.

Let's break it down:

Step 1: Push the stone from pos42 to pos43 (east, dirdown). Agent must be at pos42's west (pos41) or north (pos32) or south (pos52) or east (pos43). Wait, to push east (dirdown), the agent must be on the west side (same row, lower column). So agent must be at pos41 (row4, column1). But pos41 is clear. So agent can move there.

But how to get from pos44 to pos41. Let's see:

From pos44, possible moves:

- dirleft to pos34 (row3, column4)

- dirright to pos54 (row5, column4) – but pos54 is a goal, but the agent can move there if it's clear. But in the initial state, pos54 is a goal location but is clear. So agent can move there. But pos54 is the target for the stone.

But if the agent moves to pos54, then they're in the goal location. But the stone isn't there yet. So perhaps the agent can use that later.

Alternatively, to reach pos41, the path from pos44 is:

pos44 → pos43 (dirup, column3)

pos43 → pos42 (dirup, column2) – but pos42 is occupied by stone, can't move there.

So that's blocked. Another path: pos44 → pos34 (dirleft), then pos34 → pos33 (dirup?), etc. But this might take too long.

Alternative idea: push the stone south (dirright) to pos52 (row5, column2), then east (dirdown) to pos53, then south again? No, pos53 is not a goal.

Wait, but the only goal is pos54. So the stone must end up at pos54. So the stone needs to reach pos54 through some path.

Another approach: the agent moves to pos54 (dirright from pos44), then moves around to the west side of the stone. But how?

From pos54, the agent can move dirup to pos53, then dirup to pos52, then dirleft to pos42 (row5 to row4 via dirleft?), but pos42 is row4, column2. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, the agent moves from pos54 to pos53 (dirup), then to pos52 (dirup), then to pos51 (dirleft), then to pos41 (dirleft), then to pos42 (dirright?), but this seems long.

This is getting too complicated. Maybe there's a shorter path.

Wait, let's think of the required pushes:

To get the stone from pos42 to pos54, the stone needs to move:

- Two steps south (dirright) from row4 to row5 (pos42 → pos52 → pos62, but pos62 doesn't exist). So that's not possible. Alternatively, one step south (dirright) to pos52 (row5, column2), then two steps east (dirdown) to pos54 (row5, column4). But pos52 to pos53 (dirdown), then pos53 to pos54 (dirdown). So pushes:

1. pos42 → pos52 (dirright, agent at pos42's north (pos32)).

But agent needs to be at pos32 to push dirright (south) to pos42. Wait, the agent is at pos32, pushes the stone at pos42 (south) to pos52. But pos52 is a non-goal location, so use pushtonongoal. Then, agent is at pos42 after pushing. Then, from there, the agent can push the stone east (dirdown) to pos53, then to pos54.

But how does the agent get to pos32 to push the stone south?

Agent's initial position is pos44. To get to pos32:

pos44 → pos34 (dirleft)

pos34 → pos33 (dirup)

pos33 → pos32 (dirup)

pos32 is clear. Then, from pos32, the agent can push the stone at pos42 (dirright) to pos52 (pushtonongoal, since pos52 is not a goal). Then, the agent is at pos42.

Then, the agent can move to pos43 (dirup), then to pos53 (dirright), but this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, after pushing to pos52, the agent is at pos42. Then, the agent needs to get to pos52's west (pos51) to push it east. But pos51 is clear. So agent moves from pos42 to pos43 (dirup), pos43 to pos44 (dirdown?), no. Let's think step by step.

Step 1: Agent moves from pos44 to pos34 (dirleft).

Step 2: Agent moves from pos34 to pos33 (dirup).

Step 3: Agent moves from pos33 to pos32 (dirup).

Now, agent is at pos32, which is clear.

Step 4: Agent performs pushtonongoal to push stone1 from pos42 to pos52 via dirright. The preconditions for this action:

- Agent p is at pos32.

- Stone s is at pos42.

- Location l_to (pos52) is clear.

- Can move from pos32 to pos42 via dirright? Let's check the allowed movements.

Looking at the movement list: "You may move from location pos32 to location pos42 following direction dirright". Yes. So dirright from pos32 to pos42 is allowed.

Then, the stone is pushed from pos42 to pos52 via dirright. So l_to is pos52. pos52 is not a goal, so pushtonongoal is used.

After this action, the stone is at pos52, and the agent is at pos42.

Now, step 5: Agent needs to push the stone from pos52 to pos53 (dirdown). For that, the agent must be at pos52's west (pos51), north (pos42), east (pos53), or south (pos62, which doesn't exist).

But the agent is at pos42. To get to pos51, they need to move left (dirleft) to pos41, then up (dirup) to pos51. But pos41 is clear.

Step 5: Agent moves from pos42 to pos41 (dirup).

Step 6: Agent moves from pos41 to pos51 (dirleft).

Now, agent is at pos51. Then, they can push the stone from pos52 to pos53 (dirdown). Preconditions:

- Agent is at pos51.

- Stone is at pos52.

- pos53 is clear.

- Can move from pos51 to pos52 via dirdown (since pos51 to pos52 is allowed: "You may move from location pos51 to location pos52 following direction dirdown").

Then, pushing the stone from pos52 to pos53 via dirdown. Using pushtonongoal since pos53 is not a goal.

After this, the stone is at pos53, agent is at pos52.

Step 7: Now, push the stone from pos53 to pos54 (dirdown). Agent needs to be at pos53's west (pos52), north (pos43), east (pos54), or south (pos63, which doesn't exist).

Agent is at pos52. So they can push the stone to pos54 via dirdown. pos54 is a goal location, so use pushtogoal.

Preconditions:

- Agent at pos52.

- Stone at pos53.

- pos54 is clear and a goal.

- Can move from pos52 to pos53 via dirdown (checking movement: "You may move from location pos52 to location pos53 following direction dirdown").

Yes, allowed.

So action: pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos52 pos53 pos54 dirdown.

This action will move the stone to pos54, which is the goal.

So putting it all together:

Actions:

1. move player1 pos44 pos34 dirleft

2. move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup

3. move player1 pos33 pos32 dirup

4. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos42 pos52 dirright

5. move player1 pos42 pos41 dirup

6. move player1 pos41 pos51 dirleft

7. move player1 pos51 pos52 dirdown

8. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos52 pos53 pos54 dirdown

Wait, but step 4 after pushing, the agent is at pos42 (the l_from). So after step4, agent is at pos42. So step5 is moving from pos42 to pos41 via dirup.

Yes.

Then step5: move player1 pos42 pos41 dirup (possible if pos41 is clear, which it is according to the initial state).

Then step6: move player1 pos41 pos51 dirleft (since from pos41, dirleft is allowed to pos51? Wait, pos41 is row4, column1. dirleft would decrease row to pos31, but according to the movement list:

"You may move from location pos41 to location pos31 following direction dirleft".

Wait, dirleft for row movement. So from pos41 (row4), dirleft would be to row3 (pos31). To move to pos51 (row5, column1), the agent needs to move dirright from pos41. Wait, pos41 to pos51 is dirright? pos41 is row4, column1; pos51 is row5, column1. So dirright (row+1) would take pos41 to pos51. Yes: movement list says "You may move from location pos41 to location pos51 following direction dirright".

So step6: move player1 pos41 pos51 dirright.

Then step7: move player1 pos51 pos52 dirdown (from pos51 to pos52 via dirdown).

Step8: pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos52 pos53 pos54 dirdown.

But after step4, the stone is at pos52. Then step5-7 moves the agent to pos52. Wait, no: after step4, the stone is pushed to pos52, and the agent ends up at pos42. Then steps5-7 are moving the agent to pos52 to push the stone from pos52 to pos53, then to pos54.

Wait, after step4, stone is at pos52. The agent is at pos42.

Then step5: agent moves from pos42 to pos41 (dirup).

Step6: agent moves from pos41 to pos51 (dirright).

Step7: agent moves from pos51 to pos52 (dirdown).

Now, agent is at pos52. Stone is at pos52? No, after step4, the stone was pushed to pos52, but in step5-7, the agent is moving around. So stone is at pos52. To push it to pos53, agent must be at pos52's west (pos51), north (pos42), east (pos53), or south (pos62). Agent is at pos52. To push east (dirdown), the agent must be at pos52's west (pos51). Wait, no: to push east (dirdown), the agent must be west of the stone (same row, lower column). So if the stone is at pos52 (row5, column2), the agent needs to be at pos51 (row5, column1) to push it to pos53 (row5, column3). But the agent is at pos52. So they need to move to pos51.

Wait, in step7, the agent is at pos52. So they need to move to pos51 to push the stone east (dirdown) to pos53.

So step7: move player1 pos52 pos51 dirup (since from pos52 to pos51 is dirup).

Then step8: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos51 pos52 pos53 dirdown.

Now, stone is at pos53.

Then agent is at pos52. Then move to pos53 (dirdown) to push the stone to pos54.

But pos53 to pos54 is dirdown (column increases from 3 to4).

So agent moves to pos53, then pushes to pos54.

But this adds more steps.

Hmm, this plan is getting quite long. Maybe there's a shorter path.

Alternative approach: After step4, stone is at pos52. Agent is at pos42. Then, agent moves to pos43 (dirup from pos42 to pos43?), no. Wait, pos42 is row4, column2. dirup would decrease column to pos41. Wait, no. Let's re-express the positions correctly.

Wait, the positions are named posXY where X is the row and Y is the column. But how are the rows and columns arranged? If pos11 is row1, column1, and pos51 is row5, column1, then the rows increase downward, and columns increase to the right. So moving dirright increases the row number (south), and dirdown increases the column number (east).

So, to push the stone from pos52 (row5, column2) to pos53 (row5, column3), the agent must be west of the stone (pos52's west is pos51), and push dirdown (east).

So agent needs to be at pos51. Then, push the stone from pos52 to pos53.

Then, from pos53, push to pos54.

But the agent is at pos42 after step4. To get to pos51:

pos42 → pos41 (dirup)

pos41 → pos51 (dirright)

Then, pos51 → pos52 (dirdown)

But then the agent is at pos52. So to push the stone from pos52 to pos53, agent must be at pos51.

Wait, so after step4:

Stone at pos52, agent at pos42.

Agent needs to get to pos51.

Steps:

5. move player1 pos42 pos41 dirup (column2→1)

6. move player1 pos41 pos51 dirright (row4→5)

Now, agent is at pos51.

7. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos51 pos52 pos53 dirdown.

Now, stone is at pos53, agent at pos52.

8. move player1 pos52 pos53 dirdown (agent moves to pos53).

9. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos53 pos54 dirdown. Wait, no, because pos53 to pos54 is dirdown (column3→4). But the agent is at pos53, stone is at pos53. To push, the agent must be at pos53's west (pos52), north (pos43), east (pos54), or south (non-existent). Wait, the stone is at pos53. To push it to pos54 (east, dirdown), the agent must be at pos53's west (pos52), same row, column2. But the agent is at pos53. So they need to move to pos52.

Step8: move player1 pos52 pos53 dirdown (from pos52 to pos53 is dirdown).

Wait, but after step7, the agent is at pos52 (after pushing from pos51 to pos52, agent moves to pos52). Then step8: move to pos53 via dirdown.

But the stone is at pos53, so pos53 is not clear. So the agent cannot move there. Therefore, this approach won't work.

Hmm, this is getting very complex. Maybe there's a more optimal path that I'm missing.

Alternative idea: Instead of pushing the stone south to pos52, why not push it east to pos43, then pos44, then dirright to pos54.

Let's see:

Agent at pos44.

1. move to pos43 (dirup).

2. push the stone from pos42 to pos43 (dirup from pos43 to pos42, then pushing dirup would move the stone to pos41. No, that's not helpful.

Wait, agent is at pos43, stone at pos42. The direction from agent to stone is dirup (pos43 to pos42). So pushing in dirup would take the stone to pos41. Not helpful.

Alternatively, if the agent is at pos44 and pushes the stone north (dirleft), but the stone is at pos42. To push it north, the agent needs to be south of the stone. So agent at pos42's south (pos43) and push north (dirleft). But pos43 is clear. Wait, agent is at pos44. To get to pos43, move dirup.

So:

1. move player1 pos44 pos43 dirup.

Now, agent is at pos43.

2. push the stone from pos42 to pos43. But the direction from agent's position (pos43) to stone's position (pos42) is dirup. So pushing dirup would move the stone to pos41. Not helpful.

Alternatively, if the agent can get to pos42's east (pos43) and push west (dirup), but that's the same as above.

Alternatively, the agent can move to pos34 (dirleft from pos44), then to pos33 (dirup), then to pos32 (dirup), then push the stone south to pos42 to pos52. As before.

But this is the same long path.

Alternatively, the agent can move to pos54 (dirright from pos44), then move around to push the stone.

But how?

From pos54, agent can move dirup to pos53, then dirup to pos52, then dirleft to pos51, then dirleft to pos41, etc. But this seems longer.

Alternatively, agent moves to pos54, then dirleft to pos44, but that's not helpful.

Hmm. It seems the optimal path is the one where the agent moves to pos32, pushes the stone to pos52, then moves around to push it east to pos54.

But let's count the steps:

Steps:

1. move player1 pos44 pos34 dirleft

2. move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup

3. move player1 pos33 pos32 dirup

4. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos42 pos52 dirright

5. move player1 pos42 pos41 dirup

6. move player1 pos41 pos51 dirright

7. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos51 pos52 pos53 dirdown

8. move player1 pos52 pos53 dirdown

9. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos53 pos54 dirdown

That's nine actions. But maybe there's a shorter way.

Wait, after step4, the stone is at pos52, and the agent is at pos42.

From pos42, can the agent move directly to pos52 to push it?

Agent is at pos42. To push the stone at pos52, the agent needs to be adjacent to it. But pos52 is two rows south (row5 vs row4). So no, the agent can't directly push from pos42 to pos52. They have to move around.

Alternative idea: After step4, agent is at pos42. They can move to pos43 (dirup), then pos44 (dirdown), then pos54 (dirright). Now, agent is at pos54. Then, they can push the stone from pos52 to pos53 (needs to be at pos51), but that requires moving back.

Not helpful.

Another thought: Once the stone is at pos52, the agent can move from pos42 to pos43 (dirup), then to pos44 (dirdown), then to pos54 (dirright). Now, agent is at pos54, which is a goal. Then, move to pos53 (dirup), then push the stone from pos52 to pos53 (requires agent at pos51), which is still several steps.

This is getting too time-consuming. Perhaps the initial plan with 9 steps is the only way, but I'm not sure if it's optimal.

But wait, maybe there's a smarter way. Let's think again.

The stone needs to get to pos54. The only way is to push it dirright from pos44 to pos54. So if the stone is at pos44, the agent can push it dirright to pos54. So how to get the stone to pos44.

The stone is at pos42. To get to pos44, push it east (dirdown) twice: pos42 → pos43 → pos44.

Then, push dirright to pos54.

So steps:

1. Agent moves to pos43 (dirup from pos44).

2. push stone from pos42 to pos43 (agent at pos43, pushing dirup to pos42 → pos43 via dirdown? Wait, no. Wait, the agent is at pos43. The stone is at pos42. The direction from agent to stone is dirup. So pushing in dirup would take the stone to pos41. Not helpful.

Alternatively, agent is at pos42's east (pos43) and pushes west (dirup) to move the stone east (dirdown). No, because the direction for the push is the same as the direction from agent to stone.

Wait, the direction d in the push action is the direction from agent to stone. Then, the stone moves in that same direction. So if the agent is east of the stone (pos43), and pushes west (dirup), the stone would move west (dirup) to pos41. Not helpful.

To push the stone east (dirdown), the agent must be west of the stone. So agent at pos41 (column1) pushing east (dirdown) to pos42 → pos43.

But how to get the agent to pos41.

From pos44, move dirup to pos43, dirup to pos42 (can't, because stone is there), so alternative route: pos44 → pos34 (dirleft), pos34 → pos33 (dirup), pos33 → pos32 (dirup), pos32 → pos31 (dirup), pos31 → pos41 (dirright).

But this is a long path.

Alternatively, pos44 → pos43 (dirup), pos43 → pos42 (dirup) – blocked.

No, this seems impossible.

Alternative plan: agent moves to pos34 (dirleft from pos44), then to pos24 (dirleft), then to pos14 (dirleft), but this is moving away from the stone.

Not helpful.

This is really challenging. Maybe there's a different approach.

Another idea: The agent can push the stone from pos42 to pos43 (east) if the agent is at pos42's west (pos41). But how to get to pos41.

Agent's path:

pos44 → pos43 (dirup)

pos43 → pos42 (dirup) – blocked by stone.

So can't.

Alternative path:

pos44 → pos45 (dirdown)

pos45 → pos35 (dirleft)

pos35 → pos25 (dirleft)

... This is moving away.

Not helpful.

Wait, maybe the initial mistake is assuming the stone is at pos42 and pos42 is not clear. Given that, the problem is possible. But if the problem states that pos42 is clear, then the stone isn't there, which contradicts. So perhaps there's a misunderstanding.

But given that the user provided the problem as is, I have to proceed.

Assuming the stone is at pos42 and pos42 is not clear, the agent needs to push it to pos54.

Another approach: Use the pushtogoal action directly if possible. For example, can the agent push the stone from pos44 to pos54 in one action? The stone would need to be at pos44, but it's initially at pos42. So first move the stone to pos44, then push to pos54.

But how to get the stone to pos44.

Steps:

1. Agent moves to pos43 (dirup from pos44).

2. push stone from pos42 to pos43 (agent at pos43, stone at pos42). Direction dirup, pushing to pos41. Not helpful.

Alternatively, agent moves to pos32, pushes stone to pos52, then to pos53, then to pos54.

As before.

But this seems to be the only viable path, albeit long.

So the optimal plan would involve 9 steps. But perhaps there's a shorter path.

Wait, after step4: stone is at pos52, agent at pos42.

Agent can move from pos42 to pos43 (dirup).

Then to pos44 (dirdown).

Then to pos54 (dirright).

Now agent is at pos54. Then, move to pos53 (dirup).

Now, agent is at pos53. Stone is at pos52. To push the stone from pos52 to pos53, agent needs to be at pos52's west (pos51).

Agent moves from pos53 to pos52 (dirup).

Then, pushes to pos53. But stone is at pos52, agent at pos52. Can't push from there.

Alternatively, agent moves from pos54 to pos53 (dirup).

Then, from pos53, move to pos52 (dirup).

Then push to pos53.

But pos53 is clear. So:

Step5: move player1 pos42 pos43 dirup.

Step6: move player1 pos43 pos44 dirdown.

Step7: move player1 pos44 pos54 dirright.

Step8: move player1 pos54 pos53 dirup.

Step9: move player1 pos53 pos52 dirup.

Step10: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos52 pos52 pos53 dirdown. Wait, no. The stone is at pos52. The agent is at pos52. So can't push from there.

This isn't working. So the initial path with 9 steps is still the way to go.

Thus, the final plan would be:

```
move player1 pos44 pos34 dirleft
move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup
move player1 pos33 pos32 dirup
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos42 pos52 dirright
move player1 pos42 pos41 dirup
move player1 pos41 pos51 dirright
pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos51 pos52 pos53 dirdown
move player1 pos52 pos53 dirdown
pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos53 pos53 pos54 dirdown
```

Wait, but the last action has the stone at pos53, so l_from should be pos53, l_to pos54. So the last action should be:

pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos53 pos53 pos54 dirdown. But the agent must be at l_p, which is pos53, and the stone is at pos53. The direction from pos53 to pos53 is invalid. Wait, no. The agent needs to be at a position l_p adjacent to the stone's location l_from. So to push the stone from pos53 to pos54, the agent must be at pos53's west (pos52), north (pos43), east (pos54), or south (non-existent). So agent at pos52 can push the stone east (dirdown) to pos53→ pos54.

So after step7, the stone is at pos53. Agent is at pos52.

Step8: move player1 pos52 pos53 dirdown – but pos53 has the stone, so it's not clear. Can't move there. Therefore, step8 is invalid.

Thus, after step7, the agent is at pos52. The stone is at pos53. The agent needs to be at pos53's west (pos52) to push east (dirdown) to pos54.

So step8: pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos52 pos53 pos54 dirdown.

But for this action:

- Agent is at pos52.

- Stone is at pos53.

- pos54 is clear and a goal.

- Can move from pos52 to pos53 via dirdown. Check movement list: Yes.

- pos53 to pos54 via dirdown (column3→4).

So the action is valid.

Thus, step8: pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos52 pos53 pos54 dirdown.

This would push the stone from pos53 to pos54.

So the corrected plan:

1. move player1 pos44 pos34 dirleft

2. move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup

3. move player1 pos33 pos32 dirup

4. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos42 pos52 dirright

5. move player1 pos42 pos41 dirup

6. move player1 pos41 pos51 dirright

7. pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos51 pos52 pos53 dirdown

8. pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos52 pos53 pos54 dirdown

Now, this is 8 steps. Let's verify each step:

Step1-3: Agent moves to pos32.

Step4: Push stone from pos42 to pos52. Agent ends up at pos42.

Step5: Move to pos41.

Step6: Move to pos51.

Step7: Push stone from pos52 to pos53. Agent ends up at pos52.

Step8: Push stone from pos53 to pos54. Agent must be at pos52, which is adjacent to pos53 via dirdown. So direction from pos52 to pos53 is dirdown. Then, pushing in the same direction would move the stone to pos54. Yes.

So the final plan is 8 steps. Is this valid?

Check preconditions for each action:

Step4: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos42 pos52 dirright.

Preconditions:

- Agent at pos32.

- Stone at pos42.

- pos52 is clear.

- Can move from pos32 to pos42 via dirright (yes).

- Can move from pos42 to pos52 via dirright (yes).

- pos52 is not a goal (correct).

After action, stone is at pos52, agent at pos42.

Step5: move from pos42 to pos41 dirup.

pos41 is clear (initially yes). Allowed.

Step6: move from pos41 to pos51 dirright (yes).

Step7: pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos51 pos52 pos53 dirdown.

Preconditions:

- Agent at pos51.

- Stone at pos52.

- pos53 clear.

- Can move from pos51 to pos52 via dirdown (yes).

- Can move from pos52 to pos53 via dirdown (yes).

- pos53 is not a goal (correct).

After action, stone at pos53, agent at pos52.

Step8: pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos52 pos53 pos54 dirdown.

Preconditions:

- Agent at pos52.

- Stone at pos53.

- pos54 is clear and a goal.

- Can move from pos52 to pos53 via dirdown (yes).

- Can move from pos53 to pos54 via dirdown (yes).

- pos54 is a goal (yes).

Thus, this action is valid.

So the final plan has 8 actions. This seems optimal.
