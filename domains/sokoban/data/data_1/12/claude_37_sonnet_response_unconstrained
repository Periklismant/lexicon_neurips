Let me summarize the problem. We are in a 2D grid world and we need to move a stone to a goal location. The goal location is at position pos54. 

Initially:
- Player1 is at pos44
- Stone1 is at pos42
- The goal location is at pos54

We have three actions:
1. move: Move the agent from one location to another
2. pushtogoal: Push a stone to a goal location
3. pushtonongoal: Push a stone to a non-goal location

Let's try to think through the solution. We need to get stone1 to pos54, which is a goal location. Currently, stone1 is at pos42. 

I need to visualize the grid to understand the positions better:

```
   1  2  3  4  5
1 pos11 pos12 pos13 pos14 pos15
2 pos21 pos22 pos23 pos24 pos25
3 pos31 pos32 pos33 pos34 pos35
4 pos41 pos42 pos43 pos44 pos45
5 pos51 pos52 pos53 pos54 pos55
```

So stone1 is at pos42 (row 4, column 2), and player1 is at pos44 (row 4, column 4). The goal location is at pos54 (row 5, column 4).

To move the stone to pos54, I need to:
1. Get the player to a position adjacent to the stone, from where I can push the stone
2. Push the stone towards the goal

Let's plan this out:

1. Currently, player1 is at pos44, and stone1 is at pos42. The player is not adjacent to the stone. I need to move the player to a position adjacent to the stone.
   - The player can move from pos44 to pos43 (left)
   - Now the player will be at pos43, and the stone is at pos42 (to the left of the player)
   
2. From pos43, the player can push the stone from pos42 to pos41 (further left). This is a non-goal position, so I'll use `pushtonongoal`.
   - Now the player will be at pos42, and the stone is at pos41.

3. The player needs to get to the right side of the stone to push it downward (since the goal is below the stone). So the player needs to go to pos31 (above pos41).
   - Move from pos42 to pos32 (up)
   - Move from pos32 to pos31 (left)
   - Move from pos31 to pos41 (right)
   
4. Now the player is at pos41, and the stone is also at pos41. This doesn't make sense! Let's re-check the problem.

Ah, I made a mistake earlier. After pushing the stone, the player takes the position of the stone, and the stone moves one position in the direction of the push. So if the player is at pos43 and pushes the stone from pos42 to pos41, the player will end up at pos42 (not pos43).

Let's re-plan:

1. Move the player from pos44 to pos43 (up)
2. Push the stone from pos42 to pos41 (left). Now the player is at pos42, and the stone is at pos41.
3. Move the player to pos32 (up)
4. Move the player to pos31 (left)
5. Move the player to pos41 (down)
6. Push the stone from pos41 to pos51 (down). Now the player is at pos41, and the stone is at pos51.
7. Move the player to pos42 (right)
8. Move the player to pos52 (down)
9. Push the stone from pos51 to pos52 (right). Now the player is at pos51, and the stone is at pos52.
10. Move the player to pos53 (right)
11. Push the stone from pos52 to pos53 (right). Now the player is at pos52, and the stone is at pos53.
12. Move the player to pos54 (right)
13. Push the stone from pos53 to pos54 (right). This is a goal location, so I'll use `pushtogoal`.

Wait, there's a mistake in my planning. When using pushtogoal or pushtonongoal, the action specifies the agent, the stone, the agent's location, the stone's current location, the destination of the stone, and the direction. Let me re-think how these actions work.

Actually, I think I have the right idea. Let's re-plan using the action format given in the problem:

1. Move player1 from pos44 to pos43 using dirup:
   - `move player1 pos44 pos43 dirup`
2. Push stone1 from pos42 to pos41 using dirleft:
   - `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos42 pos41 dirleft`
3. Move player1 from pos42 to pos32 using dirleft:
   - `move player1 pos42 pos32 dirleft`
4. Move player1 from pos32 to pos31 using dirup:
   - `move player1 pos32 pos31 dirup`
5. Move player1 from pos31 to pos41 using dirright:
   - `move player1 pos31 pos41 dirright`
6. Push stone1 from pos41 to pos51 using dirright:
   - `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos41 pos41 pos51 dirright`

Wait, there's something wrong here. The action "pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos41 pos41 pos51 dirright" doesn't make sense because the agent's location (pos41) is the same as the stone's location (pos41). Let's reconsider the grid:

```
   1  2  3  4  5
1 pos11 pos12 pos13 pos14 pos15
2 pos21 pos22 pos23 pos24 pos25
3 pos31 pos32 pos33 pos34 pos35
4 pos41 pos42 pos43 pos44 pos45
5 pos51 pos52 pos53 pos54 pos55
```

After steps 1-5, the player is at pos41, and the stone is also at pos41. This is physically impossible. Let me reconsider the action descriptions.

Actually, I made a mistake in understanding the action descriptions. Let's re-read them:

For "pushtonongoal p s l_p l_from l_to d", the preconditions say:
- agent p is at location l_p
- stone s is at location l_from
- location l_to is clear
- you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d
- you can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d
- location l_to is not a goal location

So l_p is the current location of the agent, l_from is the current location of the stone, and l_to is where the stone will be moved to.

Let's start over with the correct understanding of the actions:

1. Initially, player1 is at pos44, and stone1 is at pos42.
2. To push the stone, the player needs to be adjacent to it. The player is not adjacent to the stone, so we need to move the player.
3. Move player1 from pos44 to pos43:
   - `move player1 pos44 pos43 dirup`
4. From pos43, the player can push the stone from pos42 to pos41:
   - `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos42 pos41 dirleft`
   After this, the player is at pos42, and the stone is at pos41.
5. Now, to get the stone to pos54, we need to push it down and then right. To push it down, the player needs to be at pos31.
6. Move player1 from pos42 to pos32:
   - `move player1 pos42 pos32 dirleft`
7. Move player1 from pos32 to pos31:
   - `move player1 pos32 pos31 dirup`
8. Now the player can push the stone from pos41 to pos51:
   - `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos41 pos51 dirdown`
   After this, the player is at pos41, and the stone is at pos51.
9. Move player1 from pos41 to pos42:
   - `move player1 pos41 pos42 dirdown`
10. Move player1 from pos42 to pos52:
    - `move player1 pos42 pos52 dirright`
11. Push stone1 from pos51 to pos52:
    - `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos52 pos51 pos52 dirleft`
    Wait, this isn't right. If the stone is pushed from pos51 to pos52, and we're at pos52, the stone would move in the wrong direction. I need to reconsider.

Hmm, I think there's a mistake in how I'm interpreting the directions. Let's see the list of movements again:

- "You may move from location pos41 to location pos31 following direction dirleft"
- "You may move from location pos41 to location pos51 following direction dirright"
- "You may move from location pos41 to location pos42 following direction dirdown"

So `dirleft` is actually moving upwards on the grid (from pos41 to pos31), and `dirright` is moving downwards (from pos41 to pos51). `dirdown` is moving rightwards (from pos41 to pos42), and presumably `dirup` is moving leftwards.

Actually these don't seem to match the directions for moving we're supposedly using, from the problem statement. Can I check the list of locations you can move from pos44:

- "You may move from location pos44 to location pos34 following direction dirleft"
- "You may move from location pos44 to location pos54 following direction dirright"
- "You may move from location pos44 to location pos43 following direction dirup"
- "You may move from location pos44 to location pos45 following direction dirdown"

So dirleft is left (pos34), dirup is left (pos43), dirright is right (pos54), and dirdown is down (pos45). That's confusing.

Wait I messed up the grid. Let me redo it:

```
   1  2  3  4  5
1 pos11 pos12 pos13 pos14 pos15
2 pos21 pos22 pos23 pos24 pos25
3 pos31 pos32 pos33 pos34 pos35
4 pos41 pos42 pos43 pos44 pos45
5 pos51 pos52 pos53 pos54 pos55
```

pos<row><column>

- moving from pos44 to pos34 is moving up
- moving from pos44 to pos54 is moving down
- moving from pos44 to pos43 is moving left
- moving from pos44 to pos45 is moving right

So dirleft is left, dirup is up, dirright is down, and dirdown is right. Let's confirm with another example:

- "You may move from location pos41 to location pos31 following direction dirleft"
- "You may move from location pos41 to location pos51 following direction dirright"
- "You may move from location pos41 to location pos42 following direction dirdown"

No, this is incorrect. Let me re-check the specifics of the problem statement.

From the grid I provided, if we move from pos44 to pos34, we're moving up one row. If we move from pos44 to pos54, we're moving down one row. If we move from pos44 to pos43, we're moving left one column. If we move from pos44 to pos45, we're moving right one column.

Now, according to the problem:

- "You may move from location pos44 to location pos34 following direction dirleft"
- "You may move from location pos44 to location pos54 following direction dirright"
- "You may move from location pos44 to location pos43 following direction dirup"
- "You may move from location pos44 to location pos45 following direction dirdown"

This means that dirleft is a move up, dirright is a move down, dirup is a move to the left, and dirdown is a move to the right.

Ok I think I see the confusion. These direction names are misnomers, but their actual meaning is given in the facts. Let's just rely on the facts.

Now, let's restart the planning:

1. Initially, player1 is at pos44, and stone1 is at pos42. The goal is at pos54.
2. To push the stone, the player needs to be adjacent to it. The player is not adjacent to the stone, so we need to move the player.
3. Move player1 from pos44 to pos43:
   - `move player1 pos44 pos43 dirup`
4. Now the player can push the stone from pos42 to pos41:
   - `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos42 pos41 dirup`
   After this, the player is at pos42, and the stone is at pos41.
5. To get the stone to the goal at pos54, we need to push it down and then right. But first, the player needs to be positioned correctly.
6. Move player1 from pos42 to pos32:
   - `move player1 pos42 pos32 dirleft`
7. Move player1 from pos32 to pos31:
   - `move player1 pos32 pos31 dirup`
8. Now the player can push the stone from pos41 to pos51:
   - `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos41 pos51 dirright`
   After this, the player is at pos41, and the stone is at pos51.
9. Move player1 from pos41 to pos51:
   - `move player1 pos41 pos51 dirright`
10. Let me check if we can get the player behind the stone to push it towards the goal.
    Move player1 from pos51 to pos52:
    - `move player1 pos51 pos52 dirdown`
11. Move player1 from pos52 to pos53:
    - `move player1 pos52 pos53 dirdown`
12. Now the player can push the stone from pos51 to pos52:
    - `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos53 pos51 pos52 dirup`
    
Wait, that doesn't work. Let me revise:

9. Move player1 from pos41 to pos42:
   - `move player1 pos41 pos42 dirdown`
10. Move player1 from pos42 to pos52:
    - `move player1 pos42 pos52 dirright`
11. Move player1 from pos52 to pos51:
    - `move player1 pos52 pos51 dirup`
12. Now the player can push the stone from pos51 to pos52:
    - `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos51 pos51 pos52 dirdown`
    
Wait, that doesn't work either. Let's be more careful:

9. After step 8, the player is at pos41, and the stone is at pos51. The goal is at pos54. We need to push the stone from pos51 to pos54.
10. To push the stone right from pos51 to pos52, the player needs to be at a position such that it can move to pos51 by moving right. But there's no such position on the grid.
11. Actually, I'm confused. The player is at pos41, and the stone is at pos51. To push the stone from pos51 to pos52 (which is to the right of pos51), the player needs to be at the left of the stone (at pos41).
12. Push stone1 from pos51 to pos52:
    - `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos41 pos51 pos52 dirdown`
    After this, the player is at pos51, and the stone is at pos52.
13. Push stone1 from pos52 to pos53:
    - `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos51 pos52 pos53 dirdown`
    After this, the player is at pos52, and the stone is at pos53.
14. Push stone1 from pos53 to pos54 (which is a goal location):
    - `pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos52 pos53 pos54 dirdown`
    After this, the player is at pos53, and the stone is at pos54, which is a goal location.

Let me double-check this plan:

1. `move player1 pos44 pos43 dirup` - player1 moves from pos44 to pos43
2. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos42 pos41 dirup` - player1 pushes stone1 from pos42 to pos41
3. `move player1 pos42 pos32 dirleft` - player1 moves from pos42 to pos32
4. `move player1 pos32 pos31 dirup` - player1 moves from pos32 to pos31
5. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos41 pos51 dirright` - player1 pushes stone1 from pos41 to pos51
6. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos41 pos51 pos52 dirdown` - player1 pushes stone1 from pos51 to pos52
7. `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos51 pos52 pos53 dirdown` - player1 pushes stone1 from pos52 to pos53
8. `pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos52 pos53 pos54 dirdown` - player1 pushes stone1 from pos53 to pos54

Wait a minute, step 6 doesn't work. After step 5, the player is at pos41, and the stone is at pos51. For the action `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos41 pos51 pos52 dirdown`, one of the preconditions is "you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d", which means you can get from pos41 to pos51 following direction dirdown. But according to the problem:

- "You may move from location pos41 to location pos42 following direction dirdown"

So you can't get from pos41 to pos51 following direction dirdown. Let me reconsider.

After step 5, the player is at pos41, and the stone is at pos51. To push the stone to the right, the player needs to be at pos51 as well (which is impossible). The player needs to find a way to position itself to push the stone.

1. After step 5, move player1 from pos41 to pos42:
   - `move player1 pos41 pos42 dirdown`
2. Move player1 from pos42 to pos52:
   - `move player1 pos42 pos52 dirright`
3. Move player1 from pos52 to pos51:
   - `move player1 pos52 pos51 dirup`
4. Now the player can push the stone from pos51 to pos52:
   - `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos51 pos51 pos52 dirdown`
    
No, this doesn't work. I have to revise.

Actually, why did I think we can push from pos41 to pos51 using dirright? Let me check the preconditions again.

For the action `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos41 pos51 dirright`, one of the preconditions is "you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d", which means you can get from pos31 to pos41 following direction dirright. And another precondition is "you can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d", which means you can get from pos41 to pos51 following direction dirright.

According to the problem:
- "You may move from location pos31 to location pos41 following direction dirright"
- "You may move from location pos41 to location pos51 following direction dirright"

So the action should be valid. But we're still misunderstanding the problem. Let try to understand the directions first.

For example, the problem says:
- "You may move from location pos44 to location pos43 following direction dirup" (position (4,4) to (4,3) is left)
- "You may move from location pos44 to location pos45 following direction dirdown" (position (4,4) to (4,5) is right)
- "You may move from location pos44 to location pos34 following direction dirleft" (position (4,4) to (3,4) is up)
- "You may move from location pos44 to location pos54 following direction dirright" (position (4,4) to (5,4) is down)

So dirup is left, dirdown is right, dirleft is up, and dirright is down. Let's check other locations to be sure:

- "You may move from location pos31 to location pos41 following direction dirright"
- "You may move from location pos32 to location pos31 following direction dirup"

Yes, they're consistent. I will start the planning again.

1. Initially, player1 is at pos44, and stone1 is at pos42. The goal is at pos54.
2. To push the stone, the player needs to be adjacent to it. The player is not adjacent to the stone, so we need to move the player. We need to move left from pos44 to pos43:
   - `move player1 pos44 pos43 dirup`
3. Now the player can push the stone from pos42 to pos41 (one step further to the left):
   - `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos42 pos41 dirup`
   After this, the player is at pos42, and the stone is at pos41.
4. To get the stone to the goal at pos54, we need to push it down and then right. To push it down, the player needs to be at pos31.
5. Move player1 from pos42 to pos32 (up):
   - `move player1 pos42 pos32 dirleft`
6. Move player1 from pos32 to pos31 (left):
   - `move player1 pos32 pos31 dirup`
7. Now the player can push the stone from pos41 to pos51 (down):
   - `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos41 pos51 dirright`
   After this, the player is at pos41, and the stone is at pos51.
8. To push the stone from pos51 to pos52 (right), the player needs to be at pos51 and moving to the right should get the stone to pos52.
   First, the player needs to get to pos51 by moving down one step:
   - `move player1 pos41 pos51 dirright`
9. Now the player can push the stone from pos51 to pos52 (right):
   - `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos51 pos51 pos52 dirdown`
   
Wait, that's not right. For the action `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos51 pos51 pos52 dirdown`, one of the preconditions is "stone s is at location l_from", which means stone1 is at pos51. And another precondition is "you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d", which means you can get from pos51 to pos51 following direction dirdown. This doesn't make sense, because pos51 is the same as l_from. The stone and the player can't be at the same position.

I need to reconsider the action descriptions.

Actually, I think I misunderstood the action descriptions.

For the action `pushtonongoal p s l_p l_from l_to d`:
- "agent p is at location l_p" (the player's current position)
- "stone s is at location l_from" (the stone's current position)
- "you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d" (you can move from the player's position to the stone's position in direction d)
- "you can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d" (you can move from the stone's position to the destination in the same direction d)

The problem description states: "you may only perform this action if... (iv) you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d, (v) you can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d"

From this, I take it that the player and the stone are currently at different positions (l_p and l_from, respectively), and the player wants to push the stone from l_from to l_to. To do this, the player should be able to move from l_p to l_from in the direction d, and the stone should be able to move from l_from to l_to in the same direction. Thus, when the player moves from l_p to l_from, it pushes the stone in direction d, moving it to l_to.

Ok, let's revise the plan:

1. Initially, player1 is at pos44, and stone1 is at pos42. The goal is at pos54.
2. To push the stone from pos42 to pos41 (left), the player needs to be in a position such that moving left from it gets to pos42. And I can move left from pos43 to pos42.
   First, move the player from pos44 to pos43:
   - `move player1 pos44 pos43 dirup`
3. Now the player can push the stone:
   - `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos42 pos41 dirup`
   After this, the player is at pos42, and the stone is at pos41.
4. To move the stone from pos41 to pos51 (down), the player needs to be in a position such that moving down from it gets to pos41. That would be pos31.
   First, move the player from pos42 to pos32:
   - `move player1 pos42 pos32 dirleft`
5. Then move the player from pos32 to pos31:
   - `move player1 pos32 pos31 dirup`
6. Now the player can push the stone:
   - `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos41 pos51 dirright`
   After this, the player is at pos41, and the stone is at pos51.
7. To move the stone from pos51 to pos52 (right), the player needs to be in a position such that moving right from it gets to pos51. But from the problem description, there is no position where moving right (dirdown) from it gets to pos51. I need a new approach.

Let me check if I can move up from pos52 to pos51:
- "You may move from location pos52 to location pos51 following direction dirup"

Yes, I can move up (dirup) from pos52 to pos51. To push the stone from pos51 to pos52, the player needs to be in a position such that moving up from it gets to pos51. That would be pos52.

8. First, move the player from pos41 to pos42:
   - `move player1 pos41 pos42 dirdown`
9. Then move the player from pos42 to pos52:
   - `move player1 pos42 pos52 dirright`
10. Now the player can push the stone:
    - `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos52 pos51 pos52 dirup`
    After this, the player is at pos51, and the stone is at pos52.
11. To move the stone from pos52 to pos53 (right), the player needs to be in a position such that moving right from it gets to pos52.
12. Move the player from pos51 to pos52:
    - `move player1 pos51 pos52 dirdown`
13. Move the player from pos52 to pos53:
    - `move player1 pos52 pos53 dirdown`
14. Now the player can push the stone from pos53 to pos52:
    - `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos53 pos52 pos53 dirup`
    
Wait, that doesn't make sense.

Let me check the preconditions again. For the action `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos52 pos51 pos52 dirup`, the preconditions include:
- "agent p is at location l_p" (player1 is at pos52)
- "stone s is at location l_from" (stone1 is at pos51)
- "you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d" (you can move from pos52 to pos51 following direction dirup)
- "you can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d" (you can move from pos51 to pos52 following direction dirup)

But according to the problem:
- "You may move from location pos52 to location pos51 following direction dirup" (you can move from pos52 to pos51 following direction dirup)
- There's no movement mentioned that allows moving from pos51 to pos52 following direction dirup.

So this action can't be performed.

I need to to be more careful when tracing the stone. After step 7, the player is at pos41, and the stone is at pos51. According to the problem description:
- "You may move from location pos41 to location pos42 following direction dirdown" (You may move from pos41 to pos42 following direction dirdown)
- "You may move from location pos51 to location pos52 following direction dirdown" (You may move from pos51 to pos52 following direction dirdown)

So, to move the stone from pos51 to pos52, the player needs to be at pos51. And the player is at pos41. First, move the player from pos41 to pos51:
- `move player1 pos41 pos51 dirright`

Now the player can push the stone:
- `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos51 pos51 pos52 dirdown`
But the preconditions for this action say "you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d", which is impossible if l_p and l_from are the same.

I think I've been misunderstanding the action descriptions. The idea of "pushing" a stone is that the player and the stone are at adjacent locations, and the player pushes the stone to another location and takes its old place.

So for the action `pushtonongoal p s l_p l_from l_to d`:
- p is at location l_p
- s is at location l_from
- Pushing s requires that p can move from l_p to l_from in direction d
- After pushing, s will be at location l_to, and p will be at location l_from
- This requires that the stone can move from l_from to l_to in the same direction d

Given these constraints, let's trace through what happens after step 6.

After step 6, the player is at pos41, and the stone is at pos51. To push the stone from pos51 to pos52, the player needs to be at a position such that moving in some direction from it gets to pos51. According to the problem:
- "You may move from location pos41 to location pos51 following direction dirright"
- "You may move from location pos51 to location pos52 following direction dirdown"

So the player can move from pos41 to pos51 following direction dirright, and the stone can move from pos51 to pos52 following direction dirdown. But these are different directions, so the player can't push the stone from pos51 to pos52.

That would make pushing the stone from pos51 to pos52 impossible.

Oh wait, I've been overthinking this. Let me re-read the problem description once more:

For the action `pushtonongoal p s l_p l_from l_to d`:
- "agent p is at location l_p" (the player's current position)
- "stone s is at location l_from" (the stone's current position)
- "you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d" (you can move from the player's position to the stone's position in direction d)
- "you can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d" (you can move from the stone's position to the destination in the same direction d)

The agent pushes the stone by moving towards it in direction d, causing the stone to move in the same direction.

I had the right idea initially. Let's try it again.

1. Initially, player1 is at pos44, and stone1 is at pos42. The goal is at pos54.
2. To push the stone from pos42 to pos41 (left), the player needs to be in a position such that moving left from it gets to pos42. From the problem:
   - "You may move from location pos43 to location pos42 following direction dirup"
   - "You may move from location pos42 to location pos41 following direction dirup"
   So the player should be at pos43, and the stone at pos42.
   First, move the player from pos44 to pos43:
   - `move player1 pos44 pos43 dirup`
3. Now the player can push the stone:
   - `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos43 pos42 pos41 dirup`
   After this, the player is at pos42, and the stone is at pos41.
4. To move the stone from pos41 to pos51 (down), the player needs to be in a position such that moving down from it gets to pos41. From the problem:
   - "You may move from location pos31 to location pos41 following direction dirright"
   - "You may move from location pos41 to location pos51 following direction dirright"
   So the player should be at pos31, and the stone at pos41.
   First, move the player from pos42 to pos32:
   - `move player1 pos42 pos32 dirleft`
5. Then move the player from pos32 to pos31:
   - `move player1 pos32 pos31 dirup`
6. Now the player can push the stone:
   - `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos31 pos41 pos51 dirright`
   After this, the player is at pos41, and the stone is at pos51.
7. To move the stone from pos51 to pos52 (right), the player needs to be in a position such that moving right from it gets to pos51. From the problem:
   - "You may move from location pos51 to location pos52 following direction dirdown"
   I need to check if there's a position such that moving from it in direction dirdown gets to pos51.

Actually, let me look at all the possible moves from pos51:
- "You may move from location pos51 to location pos41 following direction dirleft"
- "You may move from location pos51 to location pos52 following direction dirdown"

And all the possible moves to pos51:
- "You may move from location pos41 to location pos51 following direction dirright"
- "You may move from location pos52 to location pos51 following direction dirup"

So if we want to push the stone to pos52, the only relevant moves are:
- "You may move from location pos51 to location pos52 following direction dirdown"
- "You may move from location pos41 to location pos51 following direction dirright"

The player is at pos41, and the stone is at pos51. The player can move from pos41 to pos51 following direction dirright, and the stone can move from pos51 to pos52 following direction dirdown.

What we need is for those two directions to be the same. In fact, they need to be the same symbol, not just the same physical direction.

Actually, I just realized I've been misreading the action specification. Let me revisit the preconditions for pushtonongoal:

For `pushtonongoal p s l_p l_from l_to d`, the preconditions are:
- agent p is at location l_p
- stone s is at location l_from
- location l_to is clear
- you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d
- you can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d
- location l_to is not a goal location

The key part I've been misunderstanding is "you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d". This does require that the player can move from its current position to the stone's position following direction d. So for the player to push the stone from pos51 to pos52, the player needs to be at a position such that moving in direction dirdown from it gets to pos51.

But here's the thing: According to the problem, dirdown is the direction from pos51 to pos52. So the player needs to be at a position such that moving dirdown from it gets to pos51. The problem doesn't explicitly say if there's a position like that.

Let's see. For the player to push the stone from pos51 to pos52, the player needs to be at a position such that moving dirdown from it gets to pos51. The only position I can check is pos41, but I know from the problem:
- "You may move from location pos41 to location pos42 following direction dirdown"

So moving dirdown from pos41 gets to pos42, not pos51. I need to find another approach.

OK from what I can see, we have to get the stone to position pos54, which is a goal location. Currently, the stone is at position pos42, and the player is at position pos44. We can use the `pushtogoal` action to make the final move to the goal. 

Let's check which directions can be used to get the stone to the goal pos54:
- "You may move from location pos53 to location pos54 following direction dirdown"
- "You may move from location pos44 to location pos54 following direction dirright"

OK, so it looks like we can get the stone to the goal either from position pos44, moving in direction dirright, or from position pos53, moving in direction dirdown.

We can't get the stone directly from pos42 to pos54 (that's too far), we'll need to move the stone step by step to a location adjacent to pos54, then make the final push to the goal.

Now let's trace through the best path from pos42 to either pos53 or pos44.

Moving from pos42 to pos44 seems simpler: just move the stone right two steps.
To move from pos42 to pos43, the player needs to be at a position such that moving in direction dirdown from it gets to pos42.
- "You may move from location pos41 to location pos42 following direction dirdown"
- "You may move from location pos42 to location pos43 following direction dirdown"

So the player should be at pos41, and the stone at pos42. Now, how do we get to this configuration?

Currently (at the start), player1 is at pos44, and stone1 is at pos42.
1. First, move the player from pos44 to pos43:
   - `move player1 pos44 pos43 dirup`
2. Then move the player from pos43 to pos33:
   - `move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft`
3. Then move the player from pos33 to pos32:
   - `move player1 pos33 pos32 dirup`
4. Then move the player from pos32 to pos42:
   - `move player1 pos32 pos42 dirright`
5. Then move the player from pos42 to pos41:
   - `move player1 pos42 pos41 dirup`
6. Now the player can push the stone from pos42 to pos43:
   - `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos41 pos42 pos43 dirdown`
   After this, the player is at pos42, and the stone is at pos43.
7. To move the stone from pos43 to pos44, the player needs to be at a position such that moving dirdown from it gets to pos43.
   - "You may move from location pos42 to location pos43 following direction dirdown"
   - "You may move from location pos43 to location pos44 following direction dirdown"
   So the player should be at pos42 (which it already is), and the stone at pos43.
8. Now the player can push the stone:
   - `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos43 pos44 dirdown`
   After this, the player is at pos43, and the stone is at pos44.
9. To move the stone from pos44 to pos54 (down), the player needs to be at a position such that moving dirright from it gets to pos44.
   - "You may move from location pos34 to location pos44 following direction dirright"
   - "You may move from location pos44 to location pos54 following direction dirright"
   So the player should be at pos34, and the stone at pos44.
10. Move the player from pos43 to pos33:
    - `move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft`
11. Move the player from pos33 to pos34:
    - `move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown`
12. Now the player can push the stone to the goal:
    - `pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos44 pos54 dirright`
    After this, the player is at pos44, and the stone is at pos54, which is a goal location.

Let me check if this plan works.

Actually, for step 5, I'm not sure if pos41 is adjacent to pos42 in the right direction. Let me check:
- "You may move from location pos41 to location pos42 following direction dirdown"

Yes, that's correct.

Also, for step 3, I need to check if pos33 and pos32 are adjacent in the right direction:
- "You may move from location pos33 to location pos32 following direction dirup"

Yes, that's correct.

I think the plan is plausible. But let's check if there are any shorter paths.

From earlier, we saw that we can also get the stone to the goal by pushing it from pos53 to pos54 in direction dirdown. Let's try to find a path from pos42 to pos53.

To go from pos42 to pos53, the stone needs to move down to pos52 and then right to pos53. Let's see if we can find a shorter path.

Currently, player1 is at pos44, and stone1 is at pos42. The goal is at pos54.
1. First, move the player from pos44 to pos34:
   - `move player1 pos44 pos34 dirleft`
2. Then move the player from pos34 to pos33:
   - `move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup`
3. Then move the player from pos33 to pos32:
   - `move player1 pos33 pos32 dirup`
4. Then move the player from pos32 to pos42:
   - `move player1 pos32 pos42 dirright`
   Actually, we know the player can just move directly from pos44 to pos43 to pos33 to pos32 to pos42. Let's just use that.
1. First, move the player from pos44 to pos43:
   - `move player1 pos44 pos43 dirup`
2. Then move the player from pos43 to pos33:
   - `move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft`
3. Then move the player from pos33 to pos32:
   - `move player1 pos33 pos32 dirup`
4. Then move the player from pos32 to pos42:
   - `move player1 pos32 pos42 dirright`
5. To move the stone from pos42 to pos52 (down), the player needs to be at a position such that moving dirright from it gets to pos42.
   - "You may move from location pos32 to location pos42 following direction dirright"
   - "You may move from location pos42 to location pos52 following direction dirright"
   So the player should be at pos32, and the stone at pos42.
6. Move the player from pos42 to pos32:
   - `move player1 pos42 pos32 dirleft`
7. Now the player can push the stone:
   - `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos42 pos52 dirright`
   After this, the player is at pos42, and the stone is at pos52.
8. To move the stone from pos52 to pos53 (right), the player needs to be at a position such that moving dirdown from it gets to pos52.
   - "You may move from location pos42 to location pos52 following direction dirright"
   - "You may move from location pos52 to location pos53 following direction dirdown"
   So the player should be at pos42 (which it already is), and the stone at pos52.
9. Now the player can push the stone:
   - `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos52 pos53 dirdown`
   After this, the player is at pos52, and the stone is at pos53.
10. To move the stone from pos53 to pos54 (right), the player needs to be at a position such that moving dirdown from it gets to pos53.
    - "You may move from location pos52 to location pos53 following direction dirdown"
    - "You may move from location pos53 to location pos54 following direction dirdown"
    So the player should be at pos52 (which it already is), and the stone at pos53.
11. Now the player can push the stone to the goal:
    - `pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos52 pos53 pos54 dirdown`
    After this, the player is at pos53, and the stone is at pos54, which is a goal location.

This plan has 10 steps, compared to the previous plan's 12 steps. So it's shorter and likely more optimal.

Actually, let me try to optimize the path further. Currently, player1 is at pos44, and stone1 is at pos42. Can we move the stone faster?

1. First, move the player from pos44 to pos43:
   - `move player1 pos44 pos43 dirup`
2. Then move the player from pos43 to pos33:
   - `move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft`
3. Move the player from pos33 to pos43:
   - `move player1 pos33 pos43 dirright`

But wait, the player is already at pos43, so this move makes no sense.

I need to be more careful with the planning.

1. First, move the player from pos44 to pos43:
   - `move player1 pos44 pos43 dirup`
2. Then move the player from pos43 to pos33:
   - `move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft`
3. Move the player from pos33 to pos32:
   - `move player1 pos33 pos32 dirup`
4. Move the player from pos32 to pos42:
   - `move player1 pos32 pos42 dirright`
5. To move the stone from pos42 to pos52 (down), the player needs to be at a position such that moving dirright from it gets to pos42.
   - "You may move from location pos32 to location pos42 following direction dirright"
   - "You may move from location pos42 to location pos52 following direction dirright"
   So the player should be at pos32, and the stone at pos42.
6. Move the player from pos42 to pos32:
   - `move player1 pos42 pos32 dirleft`
7. Now the player can push the stone:
   - `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos42 pos52 dirright`
   After this, the player is at pos42, and the stone is at pos52.
8. To move the stone from pos52 to pos53 (right), the player needs to be at a position such that moving dirdown from it gets to pos52.
   - "You may move from location pos42 to location pos52 following direction dirright"
   - "You may move from location pos52 to location pos53 following direction dirdown"
   So the player should be at pos42 (which it already is), and the stone at pos52.
9. Now the player can push the stone:
   - `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos52 pos53 dirdown`
   After this, the player is at pos52, and the stone is at pos53.
10. To move the stone from pos53 to pos54 (right), the player needs to be at a position such that moving dirdown from it gets to pos53.
    - "You may move from location pos52 to location pos53 following direction dirdown"
    - "You may move from location pos53 to location pos54 following direction dirdown"
    So the player should be at pos52 (which it already is), and the stone at pos53.
11. Now the player can push the stone to the goal:
    - `pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos52 pos53 pos54 dirdown`
    After this, the player is at pos53, and the stone is at pos54, which is a goal location.

This path, as I've traced it, has 9 steps. Let's try one more optimization.

For step 5, we move the stone from pos42 to pos52. Do we need all the steps 1-5 to get to that configuration?

1. First, move the player from pos44 to pos34:
   - `move player1 pos44 pos34 dirleft`
2. Then move the player from pos34 to pos32:
   - `move player1 pos34 pos32 dirup`
3. Now the player can push the stone:
   - `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos42 pos52 dirright`
   After this, the player is at pos42, and the stone is at pos52.
4. The player can push the stone:
   - `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos52 pos53 dirdown`
   After this, the player is at pos52, and the stone is at pos53.
5. The player can push the stone to the goal:
   - `pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos52 pos53 pos54 dirdown`
   After this, the player is at pos53, and the stone is at pos54, which is a goal location.

Wait a minute, I'm not sure if step 2 works. I need to check if the player can move from pos34 to pos32 directly.

Let me check:
- "You may move from location pos34 to location pos33 following direction dirup"
- "You may move from location pos33 to location pos32 following direction dirup"

No, the player needs to go through pos33. So the optimized plan is:

1. First, move the player from pos44 to pos34:
   - `move player1 pos44 pos34 dirleft`
2. Then move the player from pos34 to pos33:
   - `move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup`
3. Move the player from pos33 to pos32:
   - `move player1 pos33 pos32 dirup`
4. Now the player can push the stone:
   - `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos42 pos52 dirright`
   After this, the player is at pos42, and the stone is at pos52.
5. The player can push the stone:
   - `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos52 pos53 dirdown`
   After this, the player is at pos52, and the stone is at pos53.
6. The player can push the stone to the goal:
   - `pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos52 pos53 pos54 dirdown`
   After this, the player is at pos53, and the stone is at pos54, which is a goal location.

This plan has 6 steps, which seems optimal. Let me check if I can find an even shorter path.

Actually, is it possible to move the stone from pos42 to pos43 and then from pos43 to pos53 (down)? Let me check:
- "You may move from location pos42 to location pos43 following direction dirdown"
- "You may move from location pos43 to location pos53 following direction dirright"

Well this would let us move the stone right, then down. But we need to check how to move the player.

1. First, move the player from pos44 to pos43:
   - `move player1 pos44 pos43 dirup`
2. Move the player from pos43 to pos33:
   - `move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft`
3. Move the player from pos33 to pos32:
   - `move player1 pos33 pos32 dirup`
4. Move the player from pos32 to pos42:
   - `move player1 pos32 pos42 dirright`
5. Move the player from pos42 to pos41:
   - `move player1 pos42 pos41 dirup`
6. Now the player can push the stone:
   - `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos41 pos42 pos43 dirdown`
   After this, the player is at pos42, and the stone is at pos43.
7. To move the stone from pos43 to pos53 (down), the player needs to be at a position such that moving dirright from it gets to pos43.
   - "You may move from location pos33 to location pos43 following direction dirright"
   - "You may move from location pos43 to location pos53 following direction dirright"
   So the player should be at pos33, and the stone at pos43.
8. Move the player from pos42 to pos32:
   - `move player1 pos42 pos32 dirleft`
9. Move the player from pos32 to pos33:
   - `move player1 pos32 pos33 dirdown`
10. Now the player can push the stone:
    - `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos33 pos43 pos53 dirright`
    After this, the player is at pos43, and the stone is at pos53.
11. To move the stone from pos53 to pos54 (right), the player needs to be at a position such that moving dirdown from it gets to pos53.
    - "You may move from location pos52 to location pos53 following direction dirdown"
    - "You may move from location pos53 to location pos54 following direction dirdown"
    So the player should be at pos52, and the stone at pos53.
12. Move the player from pos43 to pos53:
    - `move player1 pos43 pos53 dirright`
13. Move the player from pos53 to pos52:
    - `move player1 pos53 pos52 dirup`
14. Now the player can push the stone to the goal:
    - `pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos52 pos53 pos54 dirdown`
    After this, the player is at pos53, and the stone is at pos54, which is a goal location.

This plan has 12 steps, which is longer than the previous plan.

Let's try one more approach. Can we move the stone from pos42 directly to pos43, and then from pos43 to pos44, and then from pos44 to pos54?

1. First, move the player from pos44 to pos43:
   - `move player1 pos44 pos43 dirup`
2. Move the player from pos43 to pos33:
   - `move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft`
3. Move the player from pos33 to pos32:
   - `move player1 pos33 pos32 dirup`
4. Move the player from pos32 to pos42:
   - `move player1 ps32 pos42 dirright`

Ah I made an error. Let me fix that.
4. Move the player from pos32 to pos42:
   - `move player1 pos32 pos42 dirright`
5. Move the player from pos42 to pos41:
   - `move player1 pos42 pos41 dirup`
6. Now the player can push the stone:
   - `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos41 pos42 pos43 dirdown`
   After this, the player is at pos42, and the stone is at pos43.
7. To move the stone from pos43 to pos44 (right), the player needs to be at a position such that moving dirdown from it gets to pos43.
   - "You may move from location pos42 to location pos43 following direction dirdown"
   - "You may move from location pos43 to location pos44 following direction dirdown"
   So the player should be at pos42 (which it already is), and the stone at pos43.
8. Now the player can push the stone:
   - `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos43 pos44 dirdown`
   After this, the player is at pos43, and the stone is at pos44.
9. To move the stone from pos44 to pos54 (down), the player needs to be at a position such that moving dirright from it gets to pos44.
   - "You may move from location pos34 to location pos44 following direction dirright"
   - "You may move from location pos44 to location pos54 following direction dirright"
   So the player should be at pos34, and the stone at pos44.
10. Move the player from pos43 to pos33:
    - `move player1 pos43 pos33 dirleft`
11. Move the player from pos33 to pos34:
    - `move player1 pos33 pos34 dirdown`
12. Now the player can push the stone to the goal:
    - `pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos44 pos54 dirright`
    After this, the player is at pos44, and the stone is at pos54, which is a goal location.

This plan has 10 steps.

The shortest plan I've found pushes the stone directly to pos52, then to pos53, and finally to the goal pos54. This is the most optimal plan, with 6 steps.

1. Move player1 from pos44 to pos34:
   - `move player1 pos44 pos34 dirleft`
2. Move player1 from pos34 to pos33:
   - `move player1 pos34 pos33 dirup`
3. Move player1 from pos33 to pos32:
   - `move player1 pos33 pos32 dirup`
4. Push stone1 from pos42 to pos52:
   - `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos32 pos42 pos52 dirright`
5. Push stone1 from pos52 to pos53:
   - `pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos42 pos52 pos53 dirdown`
6. Push stone1 from pos53 to pos54:
   - `pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos52 pos53 pos54 dirdown`

This plan has 6 steps, and I believe it's optimal.
