Let's break down the problem:

1. The world is a 2D grid.
2. There are three types of entities: agent (player1), stone (stone1), and empty locations.
3. Locations can be either goal or non-goal.
4. The goal is to get all stones onto goal locations.

Let's first understand the layout of the grid. The initial state says:
- player1 is at location pos13
- stone1 is at location pos33
- pos42 is a goal location (the only goal location)

I'm interpreting posXY as a position at row X, column Y. So:
- player1 is at position (1,3)
- stone1 is at position (3,3)
- goal location is at position (4,2)

I also notice there's some confusion in the initial state: "Location pos13 is clear" and "Location pos33 is clear" are contradicting the statements that player1 is at pos13 and stone1 is at pos33. I'll assume those "is clear" statements are mistakes.

In the Sokoban-like game, the agent can push stones but not pull them. The agent needs to be adjacent to a stone to push it, and there needs to be an empty space on the other side for the stone to be pushed to.

The actions in this domain are:
1. `move`: Move the agent from one location to another.
2. `pushtogoal`: Push a stone to a goal location.
3. `pushtonongoal`: Push a stone to a non-goal location.

Let's think through a plan to move stone1 to the goal location pos42:

Initial state:
- player1 is at position (1,3)
- stone1 is at position (3,3)
- goal location is at position (4,2)

We need to get stone1 to pos42, which means moving it from (3,3) to (4,2). This means moving it one row down and one column left. To do this, we need to position player1 in the right place to push the stone.

First, let's get player1 to a position where he can push stone1 toward pos42.

Looking at the layout, player1 is at (1,3) and stone1 is at (3,3). We need to get player1 to a position from which he can push stone1 towards (4,2).

To push stone1 down, player1 needs to be at (2,3) (above stone1). Then stone1 would move to (4,3).
To push stone1 left, player1 needs to be at (3,4) (to the right of stone1). Then stone1 would move to (3,2).

Given the goal is (4,2), we probably need to:
1. Push stone1 left to (3,2)
2. Then push it down to (4,2)

So first, we need to move player1 to (3,4).

Let's start planning the moves:
1. player1 moves from (1,3) to (2,3)
2. player1 moves from (2,3) to (3,3) - Wait, we can't do this because stone1 is at (3,3).

Let's take a different approach. Let's try to move around stone1:
1. player1 moves from (1,3) to (1,4)
2. player1 moves from (1,4) to (2,4)
3. player1 moves from (2,4) to (3,4)

Now player1 is at (3,4) and can push stone1 left.
4. player1 pushes stone1 from (3,3) to (3,2)

Now stone1 is at (3,2) and player1 is at (3,3). We need to get player1 below stone1 to push it down to the goal.
5. player1 moves from (3,3) to (4,3)
6. player1 moves from (4,3) to (4,2) - Wait, this doesn't work because stone1 is at (3,2) and we need to push it down, not move there.

Let's revise. After step 4, stone1 is at (3,2) and player1 is at (3,3). We need to get player1 to (2,2) to push stone1 down.
5. player1 moves from (3,3) to (2,3)
6. player1 moves from (2,3) to (2,2)
7. player1 pushes stone1 from (3,2) to (4,2)

Now stone1 is at the goal (4,2).

Let's rewrite these actions according to the format of the problem (the direction in which the agent is moving seems to be specified):

Initial state:
- player1 is at pos13
- stone1 is at pos33
- goal location is at pos42

1. Move player1 from pos13 to pos14 following dirdown. (Now player1 is at pos14)
2. Move player1 from pos14 to pos24 following dirright. (Now player1 is at pos24)
3. Move player1 from pos24 to pos34 following dirright. (Now player1 is at pos34)
4. Pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos33 pos32 dirleft. (Now stone1 is at pos32 and player1 is at pos33)
5. Move player1 from pos33 to pos23 following dirleft. (Now player1 is at pos23)
6. Move player1 from pos23 to pos22 following dirup. (Now player1 is at pos22)
7. Pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos32 pos42 dirright. (Now stone1 is at pos42 and player1 is at pos32)

I'm confused by the directions specified in the problem. Let's carefully look at the direction specifications given to ensure I'm interpreting them correctly.

For instance, the rule says "You may move from location pos11 to location pos21 following direction dirright", which corroborates my understanding that the directions are from the agent's perspective (right means increasing the row, not the column).

But then, another rule says "You may move from location pos11 to location pos12 following direction dirdown", which suggests that down means increasing the column, not decreasing the row.

Let me double check all the directions:
- Dirright: Move from (x,y) to (x+1,y) (increase row)
- Dirleft: Move from (x,y) to (x-1,y) (decrease row)
- Dirdown: Move from (x,y) to (x,y+1) (increase column)
- Dirup: Move from (x,y) to (x,y-1) (decrease column)

So pos13 is at row 1, column 3, and pos33 is at row 3, column 3. With this understanding, let me reconsider the plan.

But wait, I'm not perfectly sure about this interpretation. Let me look at a specific rule, like "You may move from location pos13 to location pos23 following direction dirright", which means moving from (1,3) to (2,3), i.e., increasing the row, which aligns with the "right" direction. Similarly, "You may move from location pos13 to location pos14 following direction dirdown" means moving from (1,3) to (1,4), increasing the column, which aligns with the "down" direction.

Given this understanding, let me revise the plan:

Initial state:
- player1 is at pos13 (row 1, column 3)
- stone1 is at pos33 (row 3, column 3)
- goal location is at pos42 (row 4, column 2)

1. Move player1 from pos13 to pos14 following dirdown. (Now player1 is at pos14)
2. Move player1 from pos14 to pos24 following dirright. (Now player1 is at pos24)
3. Move player1 from pos24 to pos34 following dirright. (Now player1 is at pos34)
4. Move player1 from pos34 to pos33 following dirup. (Now player1 is at pos33 - oh wait, this isn't possible because stone1 is at pos33). Let me rethink.

I got confused here. Let's verify the initial state again: player1 is at pos13 and stone1 is at pos33.

Given this, I need to:
1. Get player1 to a position adjacent to stone1, from which player1 can push stone1 towards the goal (pos42).

stone1 is at pos33, so I need to push it to pos42, which means moving it south and west. I need to get player1 to either:
- pos23 (to push stone1 from pos33 to pos43 first)
- pos34 (to push stone1 from pos33 to pos32 first)

Let's try the second approach:

1. Move player1 from pos13 to pos23 following dirright. (Now player1 is at pos23)
2. Move player1 from pos23 to pos33 following dirright. (This doesn't work because stone1 is at pos33)

Let me rethink. I need to move player1 to pos34 to push stone1 left.

1. Move player1 from pos13 to pos14 following dirdown. (Now player1 is at pos14)
2. Move player1 from pos14 to pos24 following dirright. (Now player1 is at pos24)
3. Move player1 from pos24 to pos34 following dirright. (Now player1 is at pos34)

Now player1 is at pos34 and can push stone1 from pos33 to pos32:

4. Pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos33 pos32 dirleft. (Now stone1 is at pos32 and player1 is at pos33)

Next, to push stone1 from pos32 to pos42, player1 needs to be at pos22:

5. Move player1 from pos33 to pos23 following dirleft. (Now player1 is at pos23)
6. Move player1 from pos23 to pos22 following dirup. (Now player1 is at pos22)
7. Pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos32 pos42 dirright. (Now stone1 is at pos42 and player1 is at pos32)

Let me check this again step by step to make sure it's correct:

Initial state:
- player1 is at pos13 (1,3)
- stone1 is at pos33 (3,3)
- goal is at pos42 (4,2)

1. Move player1
   - Initial: player1 at pos13, stone1 at pos33
   - Move player1 from pos13 to pos14 following dirdown
   - Result: player1 at pos14, stone1 at pos33

2. Move player1
   - Initial: player1 at pos14, stone1 at pos33
   - Move player1 from pos14 to pos24 following dirright
   - Result: player1 at pos24, stone1 at pos33

3. Move player1
   - Initial: player1 at pos24, stone1 at pos33
   - Move player1 from pos24 to pos34 following dirright
   - Result: player1 at pos34, stone1 at pos33

4. Pushtonongoal
   - Initial: player1 at pos34, stone1 at pos33
   - Direction: dirleft (moving from pos34 to pos33 is going left)
   - Check: (i) player1 is at pos34, (ii) stone1 is at pos33, (iii) pos32 is clear, (iv) you can go from pos34 to pos33 following dirleft, (v) you can go from pos33 to pos32 following dirleft, (vi) pos32 is not a goal location
   - Pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos33 pos32 dirleft
   - Result: player1 at pos33, stone1 at pos32

5. Move player1
   - Initial: player1 at pos33, stone1 at pos32
   - Move player1 from pos33 to pos23 following dirleft
   - Result: player1 at pos23, stone1 at pos32

6. Move player1
   - Initial: player1 at pos23, stone1 at pos32
   - Move player1 from pos23 to pos22 following dirup
   - Result: player1 at pos22, stone1 at pos32

7. Pushtogoal
   - Initial: player1 at pos22, stone1 at pos32
   - Direction: dirdown (moving from pos22 to pos32 is going down)
   - Wait, I think I'm confused about the interpretation of the direction in the `pushtogoal` action. Let me re-read the action definitions.

The action "pushtogoal p s l_p l_from l_to d" requires that "you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d" and "you can get from location l_from to location l_to following direction d".

So for step 7, direction d should allow going from pos22 to pos32 and from pos32 to pos42. What is this direction? According to the rules, "You may move from location pos22 to location pos32 following direction dirright" and "You may move from location pos32 to location pos42 following direction dirright".

So the correct action for step 7 is:
- Pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos32 pos42 dirright
- Result: player1 at pos32, stone1 at pos42

This seems to be correct. Let me summarize the plan:

1. Move player1 from pos13 to pos14 following dirdown.
2. Move player1 from pos14 to pos24 following dirright.
3. Move player1 from pos24 to pos34 following dirright.
4. Pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos33 pos32 dirleft.
5. Move player1 from pos33 to pos23 following dirleft.
6. Move player1 from pos23 to pos22 following dirup.
7. Pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos32 pos42 dirright.

Let me double-check one more thing. The pushtonongoal action has a precondition: "you can get from location l_p to location l_from following direction d". For step 4, we're trying to get from pos34 to pos33 following direction dirleft. Let me check if this is allowed according to the rules.

Rule "You may move from location pos34 to location pos33 following direction dirup" indicates that to move from pos34 to pos33, the direction should be dirup, not dirleft. So it seems I made a mistake. Let me revise my plan.

Initial state:
- player1 is at pos13 (row 1, column 3)
- stone1 is at pos33 (row 3, column 3)
- goal location is at pos42 (row 4, column 2)

I need to get player1 in a position to push stone1 towards the goal. Let's take a different approach.

I noticed there's a rule "You may move from location pos23 to location pos33 following direction dirright". This suggests that to move from pos23 to pos33, the direction should be dirright. And similarly, "You may move from location pos33 to location pos32 following direction dirup" suggests that to move from pos33 to pos32, the direction should be dirup.

Let me revise my understanding of the coordinate system again based on just these rules:
"You may move from location pos23 to location pos33 following direction dirright": This suggests that moving from a position with the first digit as 2 to a position with the first digit as 3 is a right movement.
"You may move from location pos33 to location pos32 following direction dirup": This suggests that moving from a position with the second digit as 3 to a position with the second digit as 2 is an up movement.

This is consistent with my previous understanding: increasing the first digit is a right movement, and decreasing the second digit is an up movement.

Given this, let me replan. I need to get player1 to push stone1 from pos33 to the goal pos42. To do this, I first need to get player1 adjacent to stone1.

So, let's try this again.

Since "You may move from location pos33 to location pos32 following direction dirup", then to push stone1 from pos33 to pos32, player1 needs to be at a position such that pushing from there in the dirup direction would push stone1 from pos33 to pos32. That means player1 needs to be at a position from which moving dirup would lead to pos33. From the rule "You may move from location pos34 to location pos33 following direction dirup", I conclude player1 needs to be at pos34.

Similarly, "You may move from location pos32 to location pos42 following direction dirright" suggests that from pos32, pushing in the dirright direction would move to pos42. So to push stone1 from pos32 to pos42, player1 needs to be at pos22.

Let's plan it out:

1. Get player1 from pos13 to pos34 (via intermediate steps).
2. Push stone1 from pos33 to pos32 in the dirup direction.
3. Get player1 to pos22 (via intermediate steps).
4. Push stone1 from pos32 to pos42 in the dirright direction.

Intermediate steps for step 1:
- Move player1 from pos13 to pos14 via dirdown.
- Move player1 from pos14 to pos24 via dirright.
- Move player1 from pos24 to pos34 via dirright.

Intermediate steps for step 3:
- Move player1 from pos33 to pos23 via dirleft.
- Move player1 from pos23 to pos22 via dirup.

Putting it all together:

1. Move player1 from pos13 to pos14 following dirdown.
2. Move player1 from pos14 to pos24 following dirright.
3. Move player1 from pos24 to pos34 following dirright.
4. Pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos33 pos32 dirup.
5. Move player1 from pos33 to pos23 following dirleft.
6. Move player1 from pos23 to pos22 following dirup.
7. Pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos32 pos42 dirright.

This looks correct to me. Let me verify each step again.

1. Move player1 from pos13 to pos14 following dirdown.
   - Precondition: player1 is at pos13, pos14 is clear, and you can move from pos13 to pos14 following dirdown.
   - Effect: player1 is at pos14 and pos13 is clear.

2. Move player1 from pos14 to pos24 following dirright.
   - Precondition: player1 is at pos14, pos24 is clear, and you can move from pos14 to pos24 following dirright.
   - Effect: player1 is at pos24 and pos14 is clear.

3. Move player1 from pos24 to pos34 following dirright.
   - Precondition: player1 is at pos24, pos34 is clear, and you can move from pos24 to pos34 following dirright.
   - Effect: player1 is at pos34 and pos24 is clear.

4. Pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos33 pos32 dirup.
   - Precondition: (i) player1 is at pos34, (ii) stone1 is at pos33, (iii) pos32 is clear, (iv) you can move from pos34 to pos33 following dirup, (v) you can move from pos33 to pos32 following dirup, (vi) pos32 is not a goal location.
   - Effect: player1 is at pos33, stone1 is at pos32, pos34 is clear, and stone1 is at a non-goal state.

5. Move player1 from pos33 to pos23 following dirleft.
   - Precondition: player1 is at pos33, pos23 is clear, and you can move from pos33 to pos23 following dirleft.
   - Effect: player1 is at pos23 and pos33 is clear.

6. Move player1 from pos23 to pos22 following dirup.
   - Precondition: player1 is at pos23, pos22 is clear, and you can move from pos23 to pos22 following dirup.
   - Effect: player1 is at pos22 and pos23 is clear.

7. Pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos32 pos42 dirright.
   - Precondition: (i) player1 is at pos22, (ii) stone1 is at pos32, (iii) pos42 is clear, (iv) you can move from pos22 to pos32 following dirright, (v) you can move from pos32 to pos42 following dirright, (vi) pos42 is a goal location.
   - Effect: player1 is at pos32, stone1 is at pos42, pos22 is clear, and stone1 is at a goal state.

This looks correct to me. After step 7, stone1 is at pos42, which is a goal location, satisfying the goal "stone1 is at a goal location".

Our final plan is:
1. Move player1 from pos13 to pos14 following dirdown.
2. Move player1 from pos14 to pos24 following dirright.
3. Move player1 from pos24 to pos34 following dirright.
4. Pushtonongoal player1 stone1 pos34 pos33 pos32 dirup.
5. Move player1 from pos33 to pos23 following dirleft.
6. Move player1 from pos23 to pos22 following dirup.
7. Pushtogoal player1 stone1 pos22 pos32 pos42 dirright.
